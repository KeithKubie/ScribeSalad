00:00:02.147 --> 00:00:04.480
MALE SPEAKER: We have a very,
very special guest with us

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:06.080
today.

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.840
I remember reading
Charlie Munger saying

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:12.260
that he didn't know a smart man
who didn't read all the time.

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:15.560
And he has categorized Warren
Buffett as a learning machine.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:19.020
The inspiration from there
is how does one become

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.270
a very effective learner?

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.010
What is the science of learning?

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.680
And reading Barb's book,
that is exactly what the book

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.430
seems to be teaching us.

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:32.034
And I have loved
reading her book.

00:00:32.034 --> 00:00:33.450
Not only loved
reading her book, I

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.460
could identify that
the voice in that book

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.220
is the voice of a teacher, and
that resonated a lot with me

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:41.110
personally.

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.050
So I'm very glad Barb
is here with us today.

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.050
So without further ado,
ladies and gentlemen,

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.860
please join me in
welcoming Barb Oakley.

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:50.760
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.570
BARBARA OAKLEY: It's such
a pleasure to be here.

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.630
And I'd like to
begin by telling you

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:02.000
a little story-- another one.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.560
And this story is about--
well, I think all of us

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.680
love to watch other
people, right?

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.980
To some greater
or lesser extent.

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:15.140
And I love people watching.

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.320
And so I have to tell
you about this one

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.020
guy who was one of the
most interesting people

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.140
I've ever watched.

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.870
And this was when
I was working down

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.850
in Antarctica at
McMurdo Station,

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.290
and this guy's name was Neil.

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.740
And Neil was this
thin, wispy little guy

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.650
with kind of a
high-pitched voice.

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:35.440
And he had a big
head, so he looked

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.970
like this sort of upside-down
exclamation point.

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.250
And what Neil used to like
to do is he liked to pick up

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:47.010
the phone and answer it
with a perfect imitation

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:53.190
of the 6'8" gorilla of a
station manager, Art Brown.

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.330
So one day, phone rings.

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.092
Neil picks it up, as usual.

00:01:57.092 --> 00:01:58.050
(IN DEEP VOICE) "Hello.

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.710
This is Art Brown speaking."

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.700
And it was Art Brown on
the other end of the line.

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.320
So Art says, who
the heck is this?

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.710
Or more unprintable
words to that effect.

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:16.930
And Neil says, why,
Art, this is you.

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.550
I'm so glad you've finally
gotten in touch with yourself.

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.130
And so that's actually what
we're going to do here today,

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:30.060
is to help you to get more
in touch with yourself

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.610
and what you're
doing when you're

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.690
doing one of the
most important things

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:39.860
you can do as a human being,
and that is to learn new things.

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.480
Now, to start, I
have to tell you

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.556
a little bit about my
background and growing up.

00:02:46.556 --> 00:02:50.110
I grew up moving
all over the place.

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.620
By the time I'd
hit 10th grade, I'd

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.080
lived in 10 different places.

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.490
Now, moving around a lot
like this has some benefits,

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:02.060
but it also has some drawbacks,
or potential drawbacks.

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.040
And one of the things
for me was math

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.470
is a very sequential topic.

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.550
And if you miss it anywhere
along the line, right?

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:14.650
Somebody's a little
bit further ahead,

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.126
and you're from the school
where it was a little behind.

00:03:18.126 --> 00:03:19.500
All of a sudden,
you can actually

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.710
fall off the bandwagon,
and then you've fallen off.

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:25.390
It's hard to get back on.

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.990
And that's what
happened to me early on.

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:30.870
I fell off the math bandwagon.

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.710
Just said, I can't do this.

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:33.780
I hate it.

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.930
I really want nothing
to do with it at all.

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.310
Science is the same way.

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.410
And so I basically
flunked my way

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:45.320
through elementary, middle, and
high school math and science.

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:48.550
And it's really funny,
thinking back on it now,

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:51.620
because I'm a professor
of engineering.

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.150
And I publish well in
some of the top journals,

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.470
so I do very well
as an engineer.

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:03.750
But one day, one of my students
found out about my sordid past

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:08.310
as a math flunky, and he asked
me, he said, how'd you do it?

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.070
How'd you change your brain?

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:13.590
And I thought, you
know, how did I do it?

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:18.180
I mean, looking back on it,
I was just this little kid,

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.310
and I loved animals, and I
liked fluffy, furry things,

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:26.900
and I liked to knit, and I loved
language and studying language.

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:32.280
And at that time, there
weren't college loans

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.670
that were relatively
straightforward to get.

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:40.020
And so I really wanted
to learn a language.

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.510
And I couldn't afford
to go to school,

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:45.580
and so how could
I study language

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.870
in that kind of situation?

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.250
And there was one
way I could do it.

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:52.690
I could actually go
and learn a language

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:54.960
and get paid for it
while I was doing it.

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.730
And that was to join the Army.

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:58.890
And so that's what I did.

00:04:58.890 --> 00:04:59.710
I joined the Army.

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:02.180
And there you see me,
looking incredibly nervous,

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:04.470
about to throw a hand grenade.

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.320
And I did learn a language.

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:08.110
I learned Russian.

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:11.340
And I ended up working
out on Russian trawlers,

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.700
Soviet trawlers, up
in the Bering Sea.

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:16.300
And that's me standing
on a bunch of fish there.

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:19.490
I can still swear
quite well in Russian,

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:22.510
although the rest of the
Russian's a little rusty.

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:28.620
But I loved having adventures
and gaining new perspectives.

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:31.390
And so I also ended up
at the South Pole station

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:33.020
in Antarctica.

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:34.600
And that's where
I met my husband.

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:37.540
So I always say, I had to
go to the end of the Earth

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:40.820
to meet that man, and I did.

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:46.850
So the thing is, though,
what was going on

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:50.340
was I began to realize
that you know, I was always

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:53.150
interested in these
new perspectives,

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:55.450
but they always
sort of perspectives

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:57.640
that I was kind of
comfortable with somehow.

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:59.800
You know, and having
adventures, that's

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.800
sort of a comfortable thing.

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:06.350
But I wasn't actually
kind of stretching myself

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:11.150
to really have a
totally new perspective,

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:14.420
I thought back on the
engineers that I'd

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:17.240
worked with, West
Point engineers, who

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:18.810
were in the military.

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:22.840
And I realized that their
problem-solving skills were,

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:25.140
in many ways, exceptional.

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:28.170
They could think in a way
that I couldn't think.

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:30.080
And I thought, you
know, what if I

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:32.540
could read these
kinds of equations

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:34.480
like they could read equations?

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:38.540
What if I could, in some
sense, learn the language

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:40.270
that they were able to speak.

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:43.860
Could I actually change my
brain to learn in that way?

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:46.580
To learn what these people knew?

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:52.730
And so as I began to try to
answer that student's question,

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:55.100
how did you change your brain?

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:59.560
I started working on a book
to kind of describe what

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:01.960
some of these key ideas were.

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:04.910
And while I was
working on this book,

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:08.210
I did things like I went
to ratemyprofessors.com.

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:11.110
Probably a few of you
who've been in schools

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:13.250
realize that that's a
pretty good website.

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:19.460
And I looked to see who were
the top professors worldwide,

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:22.830
teaching subjects like
engineering, math, chemistry,

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:26.900
physics, economics, a lot of
really difficult subjects.

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:29.270
And a lot of very
relevant subjects,

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:32.300
as well, like
psychology, even English.

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:35.280
How did they teach so
people could learn,

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:38.080
and how did they
learn themselves?

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:42.820
And I also reached out to
top cognitive psychologists

00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:44.195
and neuroscientists.

00:07:44.195 --> 00:07:47.400
And my background
also informed this.

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:51.100
I've taught for several decades
as an engineering professor,

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:54.240
done active research
in active learning.

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:58.940
And so all of these things
kind of combined together.

00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:02.760
And what I found that I thought
was very interesting was when

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:06.050
I reached out to all these
professors, a lot of the ones

00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:08.790
in the STEM disciplines
in particular-- Science,

00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:11.270
Technology,
Engineering, and Math--

00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:14.870
used these approaches
that might involve things

00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:17.540
like metaphor or analogy.

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:19.470
But they were very
embarrassed to say

00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:23.310
that, because other professors
would kind of be like,

00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:25.870
oh, you're dumbing things down.

00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:27.870
But it was actually
something that all

00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:32.049
of these top professors used
to more easily communicate

00:08:32.049 --> 00:08:32.840
the ideas.

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:35.669
It was like this
shared handshake.

00:08:35.669 --> 00:08:38.440
They all knew how
to do it, but they

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:41.130
didn't realize these
other top professors were

00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:43.640
using the same approaches.

00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:46.150
So what I'm going
to tell you now

00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:49.020
is I'm going to give
you some insight.

00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:53.250
This, these, are the
key ideas related

00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:57.990
to learning that all of
these people have discovered.

00:08:57.990 --> 00:09:04.500
So first off, we know that the
brain is really complicated.

00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:07.750
So what we're going
to do is simplify it.

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:10.980
And you can simplify
the brain's operation

00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:14.300
into two fundamentally
different modes.

00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:16.950
First one is what I'll
call focused mode,

00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:20.650
and the second is what
I'll call the diffuse mode.

00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:24.610
And this is actually-- it
relates to the default mode

00:09:24.610 --> 00:09:31.410
network and other related--
there's some 24 or 25 so far--

00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:34.840
neural resting states
that have been detected.

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:38.720
And so all of these
states altogether,

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:42.160
I'll just call the diffuse mode.

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:45.780
And what can happen--
I mean, our best

00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:48.370
way to really understand
these two different modes

00:09:48.370 --> 00:09:50.220
is to use a metaphor.

00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:52.280
And the metaphor
we're going to use

00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:55.110
is that of a pinball machine.

00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:58.070
And a pinball machine,
you all know how it works.

00:09:58.070 --> 00:10:04.390
You just take the pinball and
you pull back on the plunger,

00:10:04.390 --> 00:10:08.020
and a ball was boinking
around on the rubber bumpers,

00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:10.010
and that's how you get points.

00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:11.620
And what we're
going to do is we're

00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:13.560
going to take that
pinball machine,

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:17.420
and we're going to
superimpose it on the brain.

00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:18.990
And you see the
brain right here.

00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:22.075
Here's the little ears, and
there's the nose right there.

00:10:22.075 --> 00:10:23.450
And what we're
going to do, we're

00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:24.960
going to take that
pinball machine

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:26.834
and we're going to put
it right on the brain.

00:10:26.834 --> 00:10:27.730
And there you go.

00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:30.380
There's the pinball
machine on the brain.

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:33.820
And you can see how you can
pull back on the plunger there,

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:36.630
and you've got all these
little pinballs in there,

00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:39.140
or the rubber bumpers,
and they're all very close

00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:41.160
together.

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:44.660
So what happens is in
focused mode-type thinking,

00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:46.540
like what I'm
showing right here,

00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:48.350
you've got these close
together bumpers,

00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:53.020
and you often have patterns
that are already here.

00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:56.960
For example, if you've already
learned how to multiply,

00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:59.850
and you're trying to do
a multiplication problem,

00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:02.190
you would sit in
focused mode, and you've

00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:04.360
got these patterns
that are already there.

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:07.410
And you think a thought,
and it takes off,

00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:10.500
and it moves roughly
around the rubber bumpers

00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:14.190
along the pathways it's
already been in before,

00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:16.860
that you've developed
as a consequence

00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:18.980
of previous learning.

00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:22.260
But what if the pattern
you're trying to think

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:24.000
is something new?

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.010
What if you already know
about multiplication,

00:11:27.010 --> 00:11:29.920
but you've never
encountered division before?

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:32.190
So you're trying to
understand this idea.

00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:34.950
Or the concept of
limits in calculus.

00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:37.990
How do you go at a
completely new idea

00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:40.500
that you've never
encountered before?

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:45.490
Well, that's where this
other way the brain works,

00:11:45.490 --> 00:11:50.070
in diffuse mode thinking,
can actually be a benefit.

00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:50.940
Now, take a look.

00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:55.300
Here's the representative
of the diffuse mode.

00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:58.070
And it's just an analogy,
but it's a very good one

00:11:58.070 --> 00:12:00.050
that helps us understand.

00:12:00.050 --> 00:12:03.040
Look at how far apart
those rubber bumpers are.

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:05.980
When you think a
thought in diffuse mode,

00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:09.670
the thoughts can range
much more widely.

00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:12.660
Now you can't think in
a tight-grain fashion

00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:15.760
to actually solve the
particulars of a problem,

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:20.300
but you can at least
get to a new sort of way

00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:23.850
of thinking about things that
you couldn't have gotten if you

00:12:23.850 --> 00:12:25.810
were just in the focused mode.

00:12:25.810 --> 00:12:28.090
In fact, sometimes,
when you're trying

00:12:28.090 --> 00:12:30.810
to solve a really
difficult problem,

00:12:30.810 --> 00:12:33.000
the worst thing you
could do is just keep

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.920
sitting there and focusing
and focusing on it.

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:39.190
Because you can be up on
that part of the brain,

00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:42.560
so to speak, and yet you need
to be in a completely different

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:43.440
place.

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:45.340
So the best thing to
do when you're really

00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:47.810
stuck and frustrated
on a problem

00:12:47.810 --> 00:12:50.480
is not to keep focusing on it.

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:53.580
You actually need to get
in a very different mode

00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:54.630
of thinking.

00:12:54.630 --> 00:12:59.020
And that's what's
represented here.

00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:00.840
And so what this
means practically

00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:05.940
for you is you're sitting there,
you're working-- hey, get out.

00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:07.110
Go for a run.

00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:10.740
Go down and have a-- go take
a shower if you need to.

00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:15.180
Or do something that really
gets your mind totally off it.

00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:18.190
Because when you're
in this mode,

00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:21.580
as long as your attention
is focused on that problem,

00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:23.980
you're still in this
mode, and you can't get

00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:26.440
to this way of solving things.

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:32.380
So how can this
play out for people?

00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:34.690
If you look at this
guy right here--

00:13:34.690 --> 00:13:38.510
he was Salvador
Dali, one of the most

00:13:38.510 --> 00:13:42.450
brilliant of the Surrealist
painters of the 20th century.

00:13:42.450 --> 00:13:45.800
He's shown here with
his pet ocelot, Babou.

00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:48.730
And what Dali used
to do is this.

00:13:48.730 --> 00:13:52.680
He'd sit in a chair when he had
kind of an intractable problem

00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:54.950
with his paintings to solve.

00:13:54.950 --> 00:13:58.770
He'd sit, and he'd relax,
and he'd relax away.

00:13:58.770 --> 00:14:01.235
And just as he'd
relaxed so much,

00:14:01.235 --> 00:14:03.830
you know, kind of letting
his mind run free,

00:14:03.830 --> 00:14:06.220
he'd have a key in his hand.

00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:10.340
And just as he'd relax so
much that he'd fall asleep,

00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:12.170
the key would fall
from his hand,

00:14:12.170 --> 00:14:15.310
the clatter would wake
him up, and off he'd

00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:19.730
go with this new idea
from the diffuse mode,

00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:22.240
taking it back to the
focused mode, where he could

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:25.150
refine and really use them.

00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:26.790
So you might think,
well, you know,

00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:29.340
that's just great for artists.

00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:32.310
But what if you're an engineer?

00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:36.860
If you look at this guy right
here, this was Thomas Edison.

00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:40.620
And what Edison used to do,
at least according to legend,

00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:46.250
was he'd sit in a chair with
ball bearings in his hand.

00:14:46.250 --> 00:14:49.020
And he'd relax and relax,
and then finally when

00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:50.730
he'd fall asleep,
the ball bearings

00:14:50.730 --> 00:14:52.590
would fall from his hand.

00:14:52.590 --> 00:14:55.010
And whatever he'd, in
his very relaxed way,

00:14:55.010 --> 00:14:56.910
been thinking about,
he'd be able to take

00:14:56.910 --> 00:14:59.010
some of those ideas
from that mode

00:14:59.010 --> 00:15:02.600
and bring them back with him
to the focused mode, where

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:05.390
he could refine it, analyze,
and come up with some

00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:07.950
of those brilliant inventions.

00:15:07.950 --> 00:15:13.960
So the lesson for us, out
of all of this, is this.

00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:19.380
I'm giving some exemplary
innovators in various fields.

00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:22.670
But whenever you're
solving a problem,

00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:25.700
even if it's a
problem that thousands

00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:29.780
or even millions of other people
have solved before, for you,

00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:33.010
it's the very first time that
you've solved that problem.

00:15:33.010 --> 00:15:37.060
And you need to use some of
these same creative approaches

00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:40.180
that these other brilliant
thinkers have used.

00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:43.140
And what you want
to do, be aware of,

00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:46.610
is that you can
be in focused mode

00:15:46.610 --> 00:15:49.440
or you can be in diffuse
mode, but you can't really--

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:51.560
as far as we know, unless
you're an exceptionally

00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:56.030
well-trained monk-- be in
both modes at the same time.

00:15:56.030 --> 00:15:59.410
So focused or diffuse.

00:15:59.410 --> 00:16:03.530
And you want to
develop both modes.

00:16:03.530 --> 00:16:06.990
Diffuse thinking is
often not conscious,

00:16:06.990 --> 00:16:09.020
but it is also learning.

00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:13.160
And so that's why that
relaxation process can also

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:15.460
be very important.

00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:17.930
Now I just wanted to give
you a quick image here.

00:16:17.930 --> 00:16:23.420
This shows some of the brilliant
connectivity of the default

00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:24.690
mode network.

00:16:24.690 --> 00:16:28.020
See all these connections
here between various aspects

00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:29.330
of the brain?

00:16:29.330 --> 00:16:33.740
This is a web for
one mode of working,

00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:37.080
but focused mode has
a very different web.

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:39.870
So if you're only
focusing, you're

00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:42.960
not making access
or getting access

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:45.750
to a lot of the different
connections that

00:16:45.750 --> 00:16:47.370
are available for you.

00:16:47.370 --> 00:16:50.330
That's why going back
and forth between modes

00:16:50.330 --> 00:16:53.180
can be so very important.

00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:57.430
Now, it takes time to do this.

00:16:57.430 --> 00:16:59.090
That's why you can't
sit down and just

00:16:59.090 --> 00:17:01.420
solve a difficult
problem immediately.

00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:04.609
You often have to go back
and forth between the modes.

00:17:04.609 --> 00:17:08.050
And in some sense, you
can almost think of it

00:17:08.050 --> 00:17:10.119
like this is a weight-lifter.

00:17:10.119 --> 00:17:14.970
And a weight-lifter, he
doesn't cram the night

00:17:14.970 --> 00:17:18.240
before a big meet and
build muscles like that.

00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:20.819
It takes time to
develop those muscles.

00:17:20.819 --> 00:17:24.859
In the same way, it takes time
to develop the neural scaffold

00:17:24.859 --> 00:17:30.260
that is involved in learning
and in new thinking processes.

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:34.420
But I know what you're
really thinking.

00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:38.990
You may be thinking,
I'm a procrastinator.

00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:40.010
I wait.

00:17:40.010 --> 00:17:44.530
Sometimes I don't, like,
have time to do stuff, right?

00:17:44.530 --> 00:17:47.880
And so let's talk a little
bit about procrastination.

00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:53.100
And sometimes you can be a
really effective human being

00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:55.770
but still procrastinate
about some things.

00:17:55.770 --> 00:17:57.730
And so in that sense,
there are things

00:17:57.730 --> 00:18:01.640
to learn to help improve
your productivity

00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:04.390
and your effectiveness
in what you do.

00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:08.930
So procrastination arises
in a very interesting way.

00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:11.590
Studies have shown that if
you look at something you

00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:17.190
don't like, the pain centers of
your brain actually activate.

00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:21.160
So if you look at a book for
a subject you don't like,

00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:25.120
you can actually feel a twinge,
and we can see it in the brain,

00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:26.840
if you're being imaged.

00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:30.180
So what do you do
when you feel pain?

00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:32.740
I mean, it's the same
pain as when you hammer

00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:35.470
your thumb with a hammer.

00:18:35.470 --> 00:18:38.910
Well, you have two different
ways of handling it.

00:18:38.910 --> 00:18:43.810
The first way is you can work
through it, like 20 minutes

00:18:43.810 --> 00:18:46.980
or so, and the pain will
gradually disappear.

00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:49.720
But if you're like most
people, what you'll do

00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:52.590
is you'll just kind of turn
your attention away to something

00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:54.600
more pleasant, and guess what?

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:57.430
You'll feel better
immediately, right?

00:18:57.430 --> 00:19:00.870
And so in some sense,
procrastination

00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:04.870
can actually be a little
bit like an addiction.

00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:07.040
You do it once,
you do it twice--

00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:08.970
it's not that big a deal.

00:19:08.970 --> 00:19:10.800
You do it a lot
of times, though,

00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:15.210
and it actually can be very,
very detrimental for your life.

00:19:15.210 --> 00:19:17.200
So I'm an engineer.

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:19.779
I believe in totally
practical, useful things.

00:19:19.779 --> 00:19:21.820
So what I'm going to do
is cut right to the chase

00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:23.600
and say here's the
most effective way

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:26.390
to help you deal
with procrastination.

00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:31.260
And it is simply to use
the Pomodoro Technique.

00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:33.710
And this is a technique that
was developed by Francesco

00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:36.110
Cirillo in the 1980s.

00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:39.530
And it involved-- he called
it the Pomodoro Technique

00:19:39.530 --> 00:19:41.900
because he had a
tomato-shaped timer,

00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:45.770
and pomodoro is
Italian for tomato.

00:19:45.770 --> 00:19:49.088
And what he would
do is he would--

00:19:49.088 --> 00:19:52.930
he recommends you set
a timer for 25 minutes.

00:19:52.930 --> 00:19:56.790
Actually, you can
have different times.

00:19:56.790 --> 00:20:00.040
Different time lengths are
useful for different people.

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:02.970
But you set it, in
general, for 25 minutes,

00:20:02.970 --> 00:20:05.980
and then you turn
off everything else.

00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:10.570
So no alarms, no instant
messages-- anything

00:20:10.570 --> 00:20:13.940
that can disturb
your concentration,

00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:15.490
you turn that off.

00:20:15.490 --> 00:20:18.930
And then you work with as
careful a focused attention

00:20:18.930 --> 00:20:21.130
as you can for those 25 minutes.

00:20:21.130 --> 00:20:24.110
Now sometimes, I'll be
working away, and I'll think,

00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:26.570
am I really focusing
as hard as I can?

00:20:26.570 --> 00:20:28.930
And then I think,
well, obviously not,

00:20:28.930 --> 00:20:30.530
because I just got
distracted, and I'm

00:20:30.530 --> 00:20:34.520
wondering whether I'm focusing
instead of actually working.

00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:38.620
But I let that
thought just drift by,

00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:40.840
and then I get back
to my work, right?

00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:43.550
And that's what you're
doing in this technique.

00:20:43.550 --> 00:20:46.480
You want to just keep
your mind on your work.

00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:48.730
And what happens is
because you're only

00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:54.380
focusing on the task and the
time, and not the pain of "I

00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:59.640
must complete this task," it
somehow makes it so much easier

00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:00.290
to do.

00:21:00.290 --> 00:21:02.950
I mean, anybody,
virtually anybody,

00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:05.680
can sit for 25 minutes and work.

00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:08.870
And then when you're
done, you reward yourself.

00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:10.762
And that reward is
actually very important.

00:21:10.762 --> 00:21:12.220
Because what you're
doing is you're

00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:14.650
focusing during
the focused mode,

00:21:14.650 --> 00:21:19.136
but then you want to train
yourself to relax, and enjoy,

00:21:19.136 --> 00:21:20.260
and do something different.

00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:25.150
Just surf the web, go out for
a-- whatever floats your boat,

00:21:25.150 --> 00:21:26.860
you go off and do that.

00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:29.750
And this, actually,
is important.

00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:34.090
Because we know that some
aspects of learning take

00:21:34.090 --> 00:21:37.730
place during this
relaxed process.

00:21:37.730 --> 00:21:40.440
So your tendency is
to think, I'm not

00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:42.320
working when I'm not focusing.

00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:44.060
But you actually are.

00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:45.850
So it kind of gives
you a little bit

00:21:45.850 --> 00:21:48.770
of a feeling of relief
and accomplishment

00:21:48.770 --> 00:21:51.490
that is OK to relax.

00:21:51.490 --> 00:21:54.650
So a couple of little pointers.

00:21:54.650 --> 00:21:57.640
First, don't sit down and
do a Pomodoro and say,

00:21:57.640 --> 00:22:00.100
you know, I'm going
to finish off my work.

00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:02.470
Don't focus on the task.

00:22:02.470 --> 00:22:04.860
Only focus on the time.

00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:07.180
And that's the trick
to this technique.

00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:10.510
Because it gets you past
that pain in the brain

00:22:10.510 --> 00:22:13.740
and allows you to just
relax comfortably and get

00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:16.330
into the flow of the task.

00:22:16.330 --> 00:22:18.390
The other thing
is don't say, OK,

00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:20.150
I'm going to do 20
Pomodoros today,

00:22:20.150 --> 00:22:24.380
and think that you're going
to beat yourself into more

00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:26.210
productivity that way.

00:22:26.210 --> 00:22:29.790
You want to just gradually start
getting used to this technique,

00:22:29.790 --> 00:22:32.790
and you'll see that it
works very, very well.

00:22:32.790 --> 00:22:38.540
Now another aspect that's really
important, related to learning,

00:22:38.540 --> 00:22:40.550
is we've also been
told, hey, sleep's

00:22:40.550 --> 00:22:43.690
really important before a big
test or something like that.

00:22:43.690 --> 00:22:46.770
Actually, sleep is important
in a lot of different ways.

00:22:46.770 --> 00:22:48.840
And I'm going to
talk to you, just

00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:53.380
mention a little bit of one of
the primary important reasons

00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:55.970
that sleep's important
for learning.

00:22:55.970 --> 00:22:58.990
We've found that if
you look at the cells--

00:22:58.990 --> 00:23:00.690
these little circles
here represent

00:23:00.690 --> 00:23:03.060
cells, neurons, in the brain.

00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:07.340
And what happens when
you go to sleep is this.

00:23:07.340 --> 00:23:10.290
Well, when you're awake--
first, when you're awake,

00:23:10.290 --> 00:23:12.440
these metabolites will
come out, and they'll

00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:14.810
go in between the junctions.

00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:18.990
And they kind of sit out
there, and they're essentially

00:23:18.990 --> 00:23:20.860
toxins in your brain.

00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:24.330
So when you're
awake, these toxins

00:23:24.330 --> 00:23:27.300
are gradually accumulating
in your brain.

00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:29.720
And they affect your judgment.

00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:32.900
That's why, when you stay
awake a longer and longer time,

00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:36.630
it's more and more
difficult to think clearly.

00:23:36.630 --> 00:23:39.630
So when you go to sleep,
though, here's what happens.

00:23:39.630 --> 00:23:43.990
Now watch very carefully to
what happens to those cells.

00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:46.120
You go to sleep, they shrink.

00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:47.900
I'll do that again,
because I just

00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:49.540
have so much fun doing this.

00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:50.040
See?

00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:52.020
They shrink when
you go to sleep.

00:23:52.020 --> 00:23:54.930
And because they
shrink, what that does

00:23:54.930 --> 00:24:00.190
is that allows fluids
to wash by the cells

00:24:00.190 --> 00:24:02.890
and wash these metabolites out.

00:24:02.890 --> 00:24:06.360
So a very important
part of sleep

00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:08.630
is just the housekeeping,
the cleaning

00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:11.780
that takes place, that
allows your brain to function

00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:14.020
so much more effectively.

00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:20.290
Now, another very
important aspect of sleep

00:24:20.290 --> 00:24:24.750
relates to neural
synaptic growth.

00:24:24.750 --> 00:24:29.890
In this wonderful paper by Guang
Yang -- she's out of Langone--

00:24:29.890 --> 00:24:34.190
is if you look at
the top picture,

00:24:34.190 --> 00:24:36.740
you can see here
what's going on.

00:24:36.740 --> 00:24:41.910
This is the same neuron
at the top and the bottom.

00:24:41.910 --> 00:24:47.500
The top neuron is before
learning and before sleep.

00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:52.310
The bottom neuron is after
learning and after sleep.

00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:57.330
All of these little triangles
or new synaptic connections.

00:24:57.330 --> 00:25:00.800
And so when you learn
something and you go to sleep,

00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:03.990
that's when the new synaptic
connections are forming.

00:25:03.990 --> 00:25:07.900
And this is what's going
on when you're learning.

00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:10.680
So that's why it's very
important, when you're

00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:12.600
learning something
new-- again, you

00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:14.680
don't want to cram
at the last minute.

00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:19.030
You want to have many short
learning periods, sleep,

00:25:19.030 --> 00:25:22.130
learning, sleep,
and that's helping

00:25:22.130 --> 00:25:24.290
you build that
neural scaffold that

00:25:24.290 --> 00:25:27.090
helps you learn so much better.

00:25:27.090 --> 00:25:30.480
So there's another
aspect of learning,

00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:34.040
and people often think this
is so completely disconnected

00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:37.630
from real learning that
they even are taking away

00:25:37.630 --> 00:25:39.599
recess from kids.

00:25:39.599 --> 00:25:41.890
Because they're like, oh,
that doesn't help them learn.

00:25:41.890 --> 00:25:45.140
Only when they're sitting in
front of us, learning from us,

00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:46.390
that's when they really learn.

00:25:46.390 --> 00:25:48.400
But that's not true at all.

00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:52.340
We're now finding how
incredibly important exercise

00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:54.370
is to the learning process.

00:25:54.370 --> 00:26:00.690
Now if you look here, this
study was is of a mouse,

00:26:00.690 --> 00:26:02.180
and they were
training this mouse

00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:06.570
to differentiate between
two different symbols.

00:26:06.570 --> 00:26:09.890
And if you look in the
background, what's happening

00:26:09.890 --> 00:26:15.950
is all of these blue
blobs are old neurons.

00:26:15.950 --> 00:26:18.670
Now we used to think you are
born with all the neurons

00:26:18.670 --> 00:26:20.470
that you have, and
that's what you

00:26:20.470 --> 00:26:21.980
got for the rest of your life.

00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:24.400
Well, of course, now we
know that's not true.

00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:29.460
But it was wisdom, received
wisdom, for many decades.

00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:37.560
And so what they found was--
see these red lines here?

00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:40.800
Those are actually
the new neurons

00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:44.040
that are being born
every day in all of us,

00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:46.920
as well as in this mouse,
in the hippocampus.

00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:50.290
And that is how--
those are absolutely

00:26:50.290 --> 00:26:54.450
essential to our ability
to learn and remember

00:26:54.450 --> 00:26:56.470
new information.

00:26:56.470 --> 00:27:00.220
There's two ways to allow
these new neurons to grow

00:27:00.220 --> 00:27:01.500
and survive.

00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:07.790
One is you get exposed
to new environments.

00:27:07.790 --> 00:27:09.460
That's why travel
can be so good.

00:27:09.460 --> 00:27:11.620
That's where your
learning can be effective.

00:27:11.620 --> 00:27:15.530
And these kinds of things can
help those new neurons survive.

00:27:15.530 --> 00:27:19.520
But the other way of helping
these neurons survive

00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:26.380
that's just as powerful as
learning is simply to exercise.

00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:29.160
So exercise is
profoundly important.

00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:30.660
And I'm not talking,
hey, I've got

00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:34.910
to be an Olympic weight-lifter,
or be a marathon runner.

00:27:34.910 --> 00:27:39.150
Even simple walking can
be very, very effective.

00:27:39.150 --> 00:27:41.290
And I'm sure you've
all had the experience.

00:27:41.290 --> 00:27:44.350
You're all muzzy-brained, and
then you go out for a walk,

00:27:44.350 --> 00:27:46.580
and it clears up
your way of thinking.

00:27:46.580 --> 00:27:49.170
But even a few days
of an exercise program

00:27:49.170 --> 00:27:50.700
is doing much more than that.

00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:54.580
It's actually enhancing
the ability of your neurons

00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:56.230
to grow and survive.

00:27:56.230 --> 00:28:00.180
Now, if you look, there's a name
right here, Terrence Sejnowski.

00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:03.040
He was on one of the
original papers doing

00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:04.670
this original research.

00:28:04.670 --> 00:28:07.610
He's the Francis Crick
Professor at the Salk Institute,

00:28:07.610 --> 00:28:12.540
and she's also my colleague in
doing the Massive Open Online

00:28:12.540 --> 00:28:16.830
Course that's based on the book.

00:28:16.830 --> 00:28:20.870
And Terry is-- he's
a remarkable guy.

00:28:20.870 --> 00:28:24.540
And it was really a lot of fun
making the Massive Open Online

00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:25.930
Course with him.

00:28:25.930 --> 00:28:29.030
And so we went and we did
some filming together.

00:28:29.030 --> 00:28:32.617
And so then I asked him, I
said, well, Terry, you know,

00:28:32.617 --> 00:28:34.700
you're talking all this
stuff about the importance

00:28:34.700 --> 00:28:35.200
of exercise.

00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:36.120
Do you exercise?

00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:36.770
What do you do?

00:28:36.770 --> 00:28:39.500
And he's like, do I exercise?

00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:46.660
And what he does is he goes and
every day, or every few days,

00:28:46.660 --> 00:28:49.140
he goes down-- he's
like a mountain goat.

00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:52.080
The guy's 65, and
he climbs down.

00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:54.010
You know, I'm
scrambling after him.

00:28:54.010 --> 00:28:57.570
And he goes running on the
beach, just like you see here.

00:28:57.570 --> 00:28:59.680
And this is how he
gets his exercise.

00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:01.040
I love how he finishes here.

00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:02.085
Watch this.

00:29:02.085 --> 00:29:02.584
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:02.584 --> 00:29:03.480
Look at that.

00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:08.040
So he is a legend
in neuroscience.

00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:09.670
And I'm convinced
that part of it

00:29:09.670 --> 00:29:12.570
is because he uses
some of these ideas

00:29:12.570 --> 00:29:16.310
that he's found in his
research to help him really

00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:19.220
keep his edge intellectually.

00:29:19.220 --> 00:29:23.510
Now, so let's just talk a
little bit about something

00:29:23.510 --> 00:29:25.020
called working memory.

00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:28.990
Working memory is how you
keep a brief thought in mind.

00:29:28.990 --> 00:29:31.090
It used to be
thought that you had

00:29:31.090 --> 00:29:33.420
seven slots in working
memory, and that's

00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:36.510
why you could hold a phone
number of seven numbers.

00:29:36.510 --> 00:29:39.610
But now we're kind of realizing
it's more like maybe there's

00:29:39.610 --> 00:29:41.950
four slots in working memory.

00:29:41.950 --> 00:29:45.590
So maybe for me, it's like
two slots in working memory.

00:29:45.590 --> 00:29:48.330
But anyway, so you
have four slots,

00:29:48.330 --> 00:29:50.940
and it in your prefrontal--
you can kind of think of it

00:29:50.940 --> 00:29:53.840
as your working memory,
you're holding things

00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:55.490
in your prefrontal cortex.

00:29:55.490 --> 00:29:57.550
So I've got it kind of
symbolized right there

00:29:57.550 --> 00:29:59.890
as your four slots
of working memory.

00:29:59.890 --> 00:30:03.770
So when you are
remembering something,

00:30:03.770 --> 00:30:06.850
are thinking about something
with working memory,

00:30:06.850 --> 00:30:08.930
you can think of
it symbolically,

00:30:08.930 --> 00:30:13.460
at least, as something like
an octopus, the Octopus

00:30:13.460 --> 00:30:17.260
of Attention, that reaches
through those slots

00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:20.160
of working memory
and makes connections

00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:22.670
between different ideas.

00:30:22.670 --> 00:30:25.960
And that's why you can't
hold too many ideas at once

00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:28.790
in your brain before
you get all confused.

00:30:28.790 --> 00:30:33.180
But what happens if
you're multitasking?

00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:36.050
What happens if you've kind
of got a little bit of an eye

00:30:36.050 --> 00:30:40.720
out here on some, you know-- am
I getting an instant message?

00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:44.440
In some sense, that's like
taking one of those tentacles

00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:45.860
away of your working memory.

00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:48.820
And you don't have
a lot of tentacles.

00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:52.920
So it really is kind
of actually making

00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:55.836
whatever intellectual
heft you have,

00:30:55.836 --> 00:30:57.210
you're kind of
losing some of it.

00:30:57.210 --> 00:31:00.500
You're getting a little stupider
when you're multitasking.

00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:04.870
So that's why careful focused
attention is so incredibly

00:31:04.870 --> 00:31:07.130
important, especially when
you're working on something

00:31:07.130 --> 00:31:08.980
that's rather difficult.

00:31:08.980 --> 00:31:13.660
Now, I just like to contrast
this with the diffuse mode.

00:31:13.660 --> 00:31:17.600
The diffuse mode, it's
a lot of connections,

00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:21.590
but they're much more random
in how they take place.

00:31:21.590 --> 00:31:25.540
So how do you take something
from working memory

00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:29.490
into long-term memory, which
is more distributed around

00:31:29.490 --> 00:31:31.020
in your brain?

00:31:31.020 --> 00:31:35.500
Well, the best way
is through practice.

00:31:35.500 --> 00:31:38.730
Practice makes, in
some sense, permanent.

00:31:38.730 --> 00:31:43.210
The more you practice, the
broader that little neural

00:31:43.210 --> 00:31:49.380
pathway becomes, and the more
deeply embedded it becomes.

00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:53.180
So if you're learning
something and you practice,

00:31:53.180 --> 00:31:56.070
those patterns get
deeper and deeper.

00:31:56.070 --> 00:31:59.590
And that's how you can
learn something and draw it

00:31:59.590 --> 00:32:04.530
from long-term memory
into working memory.

00:32:04.530 --> 00:32:07.670
If you don't practice,
what's going to happen

00:32:07.670 --> 00:32:10.850
is you've got those
neurons, and it's almost

00:32:10.850 --> 00:32:13.530
like you've got these little
metabolic vampires that just

00:32:13.530 --> 00:32:15.760
come and they suck
those patterns away

00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:17.730
before they can get deepened.

00:32:17.730 --> 00:32:21.780
And so that's why sometimes
you can learn something

00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:24.720
from a professor-- you
even understand it.

00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:27.150
You've had that great
stroke of insight.

00:32:27.150 --> 00:32:27.940
You walk away.

00:32:27.940 --> 00:32:30.210
You don't look at
it for a few days,

00:32:30.210 --> 00:32:33.270
and those little
metabolic vampires just

00:32:33.270 --> 00:32:35.370
suck that pattern away.

00:32:35.370 --> 00:32:37.930
And you can't really
remember or understand

00:32:37.930 --> 00:32:40.360
what you had learned previously.

00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:43.860
So the best way to get
patterns well-embedded

00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:46.320
in your long-term
memory is to practice

00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:48.110
through spaced repetition.

00:32:48.110 --> 00:32:51.300
So you might practice
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,

00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:52.830
maybe again on Friday.

00:32:52.830 --> 00:32:56.820
And by spacing things
out, you realize, now,

00:32:56.820 --> 00:32:59.990
that you're getting those new
synaptic connections growing

00:32:59.990 --> 00:33:03.080
every time you learn a little
and then you sleep on it.

00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:05.440
What you don't want
to do is this kind

00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:08.360
of thing, where you're just
kind of cramming like crazy.

00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:11.670
And then look, that
metabolic vampire just

00:33:11.670 --> 00:33:16.300
kind of sucks at all away, and
you're left with very little.

00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:20.000
It's hard to remember
what you were learning.

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:25.910
A good way to think about this
is just the analogy of a wall.

00:33:25.910 --> 00:33:28.510
If you're building a brick
wall and you give yourself

00:33:28.510 --> 00:33:32.690
time between layers
of mortar, it can set,

00:33:32.690 --> 00:33:35.240
and you can build a
solid, sturdy wall.

00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:38.500
But if you don't, it's
all kind of a jumble.

00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:41.260
And it doesn't turn into
a really good structure

00:33:41.260 --> 00:33:43.590
that you can actually use.

00:33:43.590 --> 00:33:45.660
So let's go back
again, and we're

00:33:45.660 --> 00:33:48.280
going to talk a little
bit more, quickly,

00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:54.790
about attention, and the
relationship with working

00:33:54.790 --> 00:33:56.660
memory.

00:33:56.660 --> 00:33:59.890
Now, if you look
here, you can see

00:33:59.890 --> 00:34:04.070
you've got one slot in your
working memory that's filled.

00:34:04.070 --> 00:34:07.440
When you have one slot filled,
you could put other things

00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:09.500
in your working memory.

00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:12.800
But here's the trick.

00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:16.320
How do you get things
into just one slot?

00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:21.150
It turns out that if you
create a chunk, one chunk,

00:34:21.150 --> 00:34:25.960
of the material, it's easy
to pull into working memory.

00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:28.429
So here's what I mean by that.

00:34:28.429 --> 00:34:33.719
If you look here, here's a raw
pattern of information, right?

00:34:33.719 --> 00:34:35.040
It's a puzzle.

00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:36.469
It's hard to figure out.

00:34:36.469 --> 00:34:39.530
It looks like a mad scramble.

00:34:39.530 --> 00:34:42.100
And look what's going on
in your working memory.

00:34:42.100 --> 00:34:43.870
It's kind of going
a little crazy,

00:34:43.870 --> 00:34:45.050
trying to figure things out.

00:34:45.050 --> 00:34:47.860
In fact, recent
research at Stanford

00:34:47.860 --> 00:34:52.250
has shown children who are
trying to learn math facts,

00:34:52.250 --> 00:34:55.770
their little prefrontal
cortexes are going crazy

00:34:55.770 --> 00:35:00.560
as they try to assimilate
and master the material.

00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:05.460
But once they've got those
math facts down, this relaxes.

00:35:05.460 --> 00:35:07.560
What's actually
happening is this.

00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:14.040
They've got the essential idea,
and what that essential idea

00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:19.030
is like is one smooth,
single ribbon they can easily

00:35:19.030 --> 00:35:21.840
pull into working memory
when they need to,

00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:26.880
in order to understand and make
connections with other problems

00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:28.750
that they're trying to solve.

00:35:28.750 --> 00:35:30.760
Now, if you just
memorize and you're not

00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:33.220
understanding what
you're memorizing,

00:35:33.220 --> 00:35:36.290
that's like creating
that little circle there.

00:35:36.290 --> 00:35:38.800
And you can see it.

00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:39.790
You've got it.

00:35:39.790 --> 00:35:40.980
It really is a chunk.

00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:44.640
But you can't fit it very
well with other chunks.

00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:47.460
So there's another important
idea about chunking,

00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:48.880
and that's this.

00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:53.900
Once you've compressed an
idea-- one of the most brilliant

00:35:53.900 --> 00:35:55.610
mathematicians
was mentioning one

00:35:55.610 --> 00:35:59.500
of the great aspects of
math is simply that idea

00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:01.680
that you can compress it.

00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:05.160
You grapple, grapple, grapple,
and all of a sudden, it clicks,

00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:06.810
and you've got it compressed.

00:36:06.810 --> 00:36:09.960
Once you've got it
compressed in a chunk,

00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:13.980
there's actually-- you can
make that chunk bigger, right?

00:36:13.980 --> 00:36:16.400
Just like learning a
little piece of song?

00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:18.900
You can actually learn another
piece and join them together,

00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:20.910
and you've got a bigger chunk.

00:36:20.910 --> 00:36:27.690
Or you can also learn similar
chunks of other disciplines,

00:36:27.690 --> 00:36:29.580
and it's very, very helpful.

00:36:29.580 --> 00:36:31.656
That's an idea of transfer.

00:36:31.656 --> 00:36:33.030
But what you're
really doing when

00:36:33.030 --> 00:36:35.850
you're learning and
mastering a topic

00:36:35.850 --> 00:36:40.350
is you are, in some sense,
creating a library of chunks.

00:36:40.350 --> 00:36:43.110
And you can draw on
that library and make

00:36:43.110 --> 00:36:44.830
connections between things.

00:36:44.830 --> 00:36:49.820
And that's how great
creativity arises,

00:36:49.820 --> 00:36:52.700
is making connections
with those chunks.

00:36:52.700 --> 00:36:57.705
So true experts often have
enormous libraries of chunks

00:36:57.705 --> 00:36:59.760
that they've developed.

00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:02.940
Now, when you're
learning, there's

00:37:02.940 --> 00:37:07.060
sort of a-- you can think of it
as there's a top-down approach.

00:37:07.060 --> 00:37:12.140
So if you're
learning a new topic,

00:37:12.140 --> 00:37:15.360
you can almost think of it
like there's a chunk there,

00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:19.660
that's that tire, and here's
a chunk that's the man's face,

00:37:19.660 --> 00:37:20.580
and another tire.

00:37:20.580 --> 00:37:23.020
So you're learning
all these chunks,

00:37:23.020 --> 00:37:26.040
and when you get them
all kind of learned,

00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:28.600
it forms the big
picture of the material.

00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:30.830
Even if you're missing a
few pieces here and there,

00:37:30.830 --> 00:37:33.410
you've still got
that big picture.

00:37:33.410 --> 00:37:37.800
But if you don't practice
and repeat and really master

00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:39.800
your chunks, it's like this.

00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:42.440
It's like you're trying to
put together the big picture

00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:44.390
with chunks that are faint.

00:37:44.390 --> 00:37:47.100
And it's much harder to put
together the big picture

00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:49.220
with that in mind.

00:37:49.220 --> 00:37:51.510
So again, as I
was saying, you've

00:37:51.510 --> 00:37:54.720
got one ribbon of thought.

00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:55.610
That's a chunk.

00:37:55.610 --> 00:38:00.490
Here is another chunk
in another field,

00:38:00.490 --> 00:38:03.480
but it's of a similar shape.

00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:05.780
And that's the idea of transfer.

00:38:05.780 --> 00:38:08.800
So if you're a
physicist, you may

00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:11.030
be able to learn
economics more easily,

00:38:11.030 --> 00:38:15.230
because some of the chunks are
really similar in their shape.

00:38:15.230 --> 00:38:18.740
If you are a language
learner and you're

00:38:18.740 --> 00:38:23.740
learning math and science,
there are meta-chunks available.

00:38:23.740 --> 00:38:26.440
For example, that idea of
practice and repetition

00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:30.670
for language also applies in
learning math and science.

00:38:30.670 --> 00:38:35.460
So let's go to some
other aspect that I

00:38:35.460 --> 00:38:37.110
think relates to learning.

00:38:37.110 --> 00:38:40.070
Some of you may
say-- so of you may

00:38:40.070 --> 00:38:42.480
have wonderful memories here.

00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:46.610
But some of you may wish
you had better memories.

00:38:46.610 --> 00:38:49.240
Well, let me kind of give
you a little awareness.

00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:52.790
What you think may be
a negative attribute

00:38:52.790 --> 00:38:56.780
actually can be a very,
very positive attribute.

00:38:56.780 --> 00:39:02.110
It turns out that when you have
a poor working memory, what

00:39:02.110 --> 00:39:04.600
that really means is you
can't hold things in mind

00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:05.800
very well, right?

00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:08.670
So you're looking at your
colleague who can remember

00:39:08.670 --> 00:39:10.780
all this different stuff.

00:39:10.780 --> 00:39:12.860
They can hold it in
their working memory,

00:39:12.860 --> 00:39:16.210
turn somersaults with it, and
come up with new ideas really

00:39:16.210 --> 00:39:16.740
quickly.

00:39:16.740 --> 00:39:18.860
And you're lucky
to remember what

00:39:18.860 --> 00:39:21.230
they were even talking about.

00:39:21.230 --> 00:39:23.140
But here's the thing.

00:39:23.140 --> 00:39:27.140
Research has shown that if you
have a poor working memory,

00:39:27.140 --> 00:39:30.610
and your four slots
are pretty weak,

00:39:30.610 --> 00:39:33.650
other stuff is
always slipping in.

00:39:33.650 --> 00:39:37.200
That's why you can't hold
ideas very well in your mind.

00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:39.960
But because the other
stuff is slipping in,

00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:42.490
you're actually more creative.

00:39:42.490 --> 00:39:48.980
And research has shown that
if you have Attention Deficit

00:39:48.980 --> 00:39:53.560
Disorder, or your attention
wanders-- oh, shiny!

00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:57.490
Then what that means
is you have much more

00:39:57.490 --> 00:39:59.920
potential for being creative.

00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:02.440
Do you have to work harder
than some other people

00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:04.720
in order to make up for that?

00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:06.260
Yeah, you do.

00:40:06.260 --> 00:40:10.300
But that comes
with the trade-off

00:40:10.300 --> 00:40:12.140
that you are highly creative.

00:40:12.140 --> 00:40:15.640
So you can be very, very
valuable in your job,

00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:18.330
even though you may have
to work harder sometimes

00:40:18.330 --> 00:40:20.930
to have that achievement.

00:40:20.930 --> 00:40:24.190
Now, you may say, well,
that's all well and good,

00:40:24.190 --> 00:40:27.310
but I'm actually a slow thinker.

00:40:27.310 --> 00:40:30.530
I see these other people, and
they've got like a super race

00:40:30.530 --> 00:40:31.300
car brain.

00:40:31.300 --> 00:40:33.830
They can pick up
these ideas so fast,

00:40:33.830 --> 00:40:37.440
and I kind of move
along more slowly.

00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:41.820
Well, one of my heroes
in the history of science

00:40:41.820 --> 00:40:44.870
is the Nobel Prize
winner Santiago Ramon y

00:40:44.870 --> 00:40:49.560
Cajal, who's known as the
father of modern neuroscience.

00:40:49.560 --> 00:40:54.420
Ramon y Cajal was not a
genius, and he said so himself.

00:40:54.420 --> 00:40:59.200
Part of what he did was he
worked hard and was persistent.

00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:02.440
But he said, these
with race car brains--

00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:06.570
which he was not--
often race along

00:41:06.570 --> 00:41:11.350
and they jump to conclusions
that he didn't miss.

00:41:11.350 --> 00:41:15.940
He would see them, and he was
more flexible in his thinking.

00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:20.340
When he'd see a mistake,
he would go, wait a minute.

00:41:20.340 --> 00:41:22.950
Whereas the race car
driver is so used

00:41:22.950 --> 00:41:26.830
to being right and being
fast that they're much less

00:41:26.830 --> 00:41:31.330
able to be persistent
and to flexibly

00:41:31.330 --> 00:41:34.980
change in the light
of contradictory data.

00:41:34.980 --> 00:41:41.089
So if you have a slow brain,
think of it like this.

00:41:41.089 --> 00:41:42.880
There's the person with
the race car brain.

00:41:42.880 --> 00:41:44.020
Great.

00:41:44.020 --> 00:41:46.700
But you're the hiker,
and your experience

00:41:46.700 --> 00:41:48.110
is completely different.

00:41:48.110 --> 00:41:49.100
You walk along.

00:41:49.100 --> 00:41:52.350
You can see the little rabbit
trails that they've missed.

00:41:52.350 --> 00:41:55.270
You can reach out and
touch the pine needles.

00:41:55.270 --> 00:41:57.570
You can smell the pine forest.

00:41:57.570 --> 00:42:00.650
All of this is missed
by the race car driver.

00:42:00.650 --> 00:42:04.240
So your way of thinking can
be exceptionally valuable,

00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:05.360
as well.

00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:11.040
In fact, Maryam Mirzakhani,
she won the Fields Medal,

00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:13.940
which is the top
award in mathematics,

00:42:13.940 --> 00:42:16.850
the equivalent for mathematics
of the Nobel Prize.

00:42:16.850 --> 00:42:19.460
And she was told
as a young person,

00:42:19.460 --> 00:42:23.080
you think too slowly
to be a mathematician.

00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:24.050
Well, guess what?

00:42:24.050 --> 00:42:27.610
She's one of the most
creative mathematicians alive.

00:42:27.610 --> 00:42:30.230
So if you think slowly,
more power to you.

00:42:30.230 --> 00:42:32.150
You're doing good.

00:42:32.150 --> 00:42:35.960
Now, I also want to
bring up another aspect,

00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:40.160
and that is the aspect
of the impostor syndrome.

00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:43.300
This is so important
and so common.

00:42:43.300 --> 00:42:46.650
And what it is, it's
a feeling like you're

00:42:46.650 --> 00:42:49.160
the fake in the room, right?

00:42:49.160 --> 00:42:50.910
I'm working here?

00:42:50.910 --> 00:42:53.160
Maybe I'm working at
Google and I'm really not

00:42:53.160 --> 00:42:56.990
as good as they say that I am,
and I'm kind of an impostor

00:42:56.990 --> 00:42:57.710
here.

00:42:57.710 --> 00:42:59.652
And people feel this
all over the world,

00:42:59.652 --> 00:43:00.860
no matter what they're doing.

00:43:00.860 --> 00:43:01.720
You're a professor?

00:43:01.720 --> 00:43:02.730
Oh, wait a minute.

00:43:02.730 --> 00:43:06.120
You know, they're going to find
out what the real truth is.

00:43:06.120 --> 00:43:08.370
I took a test, and I did well.

00:43:08.370 --> 00:43:09.940
But next time,
I'm gonna fail it,

00:43:09.940 --> 00:43:13.010
because I know they'll find
out what the real truth is.

00:43:13.010 --> 00:43:15.590
Really, really common feeling.

00:43:15.590 --> 00:43:19.330
And the best way to address
the impostor syndrome

00:43:19.330 --> 00:43:22.510
is to just be aware
how common it is.

00:43:22.510 --> 00:43:24.484
So next time you
have a thought like,

00:43:24.484 --> 00:43:25.900
I'm really not as
good as they say

00:43:25.900 --> 00:43:30.910
I am, remember, that's the
impostor syndrome talking.

00:43:30.910 --> 00:43:35.520
And probably one of the
most important things

00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:37.840
that I could bring
up-- and so that's

00:43:37.840 --> 00:43:39.850
why I'm doing it
towards the end here--

00:43:39.850 --> 00:43:45.130
is this idea of illusions
of competence in learning.

00:43:45.130 --> 00:43:50.650
Now, let's say that
suddenly, for some reason,

00:43:50.650 --> 00:43:54.290
a bear came hurtling
out of this screen

00:43:54.290 --> 00:43:57.500
and rampaging through the room.

00:43:57.500 --> 00:44:02.020
Would you feel a surge of
adrenaline and nervous energy?

00:44:02.020 --> 00:44:06.580
I mean, suddenly your body
would react physiologically

00:44:06.580 --> 00:44:10.520
to this feeling of intense fear
as you realized the bear was

00:44:10.520 --> 00:44:12.390
actually in front of you.

00:44:12.390 --> 00:44:19.110
But the thing is, when you think
about learning situations--

00:44:19.110 --> 00:44:22.616
we often say, students
will come up and say,

00:44:22.616 --> 00:44:25.490
you know, I have test anxiety.

00:44:25.490 --> 00:44:28.910
That's why I didn't
do well on this test.

00:44:28.910 --> 00:44:31.300
But for a lot of
students, sadly,

00:44:31.300 --> 00:44:33.440
sitting down and
looking at a test

00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:36.670
is like there's a bear there.

00:44:36.670 --> 00:44:39.150
They just realized,
at that moment,

00:44:39.150 --> 00:44:41.770
that they really didn't
know the material,

00:44:41.770 --> 00:44:43.780
even though they
thought they did.

00:44:43.780 --> 00:44:48.490
So students, and people,
can fool themselves

00:44:48.490 --> 00:44:50.950
that they're learning
something when they're actually

00:44:50.950 --> 00:44:52.390
not learning something.

00:44:52.390 --> 00:44:55.945
So I'll give you some of the
best ways for truly learning

00:44:55.945 --> 00:44:57.290
something.

00:44:57.290 --> 00:45:00.380
First off, tests are the best.

00:45:00.380 --> 00:45:03.280
Test yourself on
everything, all the time.

00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:06.000
The same hour spent
testing as opposed

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:09.660
to that hour spent studying,
you will learn far more

00:45:09.660 --> 00:45:11.280
by taking a test.

00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:13.650
And use flashcards.

00:45:13.650 --> 00:45:16.650
Flashcards are not just
for language learners.

00:45:16.650 --> 00:45:19.520
Why let them have all the fun?

00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:22.340
Flashcards are for ordinary--
for learning in math

00:45:22.340 --> 00:45:24.480
and science, for example.

00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:27.630
If you talk to great poets,
what great ports will tell

00:45:27.630 --> 00:45:31.650
you is memorize the
poem, because you'll

00:45:31.650 --> 00:45:37.080
feel the passion and the power
of the poem much more deeply.

00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:40.980
Why should mathematicians not
be able to share in this fun?

00:45:40.980 --> 00:45:42.260
How about engineers?

00:45:42.260 --> 00:45:46.230
When we have equations, if
you memorize the equation,

00:45:46.230 --> 00:45:50.860
and really look at what does it
mean while you're doing that,

00:45:50.860 --> 00:45:53.700
it actually can bring
out the richness

00:45:53.700 --> 00:45:55.100
of what you're learning.

00:45:55.100 --> 00:45:59.010
And the thing is when
you're having homework.

00:45:59.010 --> 00:46:00.420
Homework-- a lot
of times, people

00:46:00.420 --> 00:46:02.380
make the mistake
of thinking, hey,

00:46:02.380 --> 00:46:04.730
you know, I did my
homework problem.

00:46:04.730 --> 00:46:07.240
And it's like saying,
I'm learning the piano

00:46:07.240 --> 00:46:12.070
and I played this piano piece
one time, and so I've got it.

00:46:12.070 --> 00:46:13.660
Well, nobody does
that when they're

00:46:13.660 --> 00:46:15.330
learning a musical instrument.

00:46:15.330 --> 00:46:17.290
And in the same way,
when you're studying,

00:46:17.290 --> 00:46:20.700
you don't want to just do
a homework problem once.

00:46:20.700 --> 00:46:22.770
You don't have time
to do all of them

00:46:22.770 --> 00:46:26.320
and kind of repeat them, but
pick some of the key ones

00:46:26.320 --> 00:46:29.820
and see if you can do it again.

00:46:29.820 --> 00:46:33.060
Like practice it, and
maybe do it in your mind.

00:46:33.060 --> 00:46:35.400
Can you step through
all the steps?

00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:39.710
If you can play it almost
like a song in your mind,

00:46:39.710 --> 00:46:40.950
you've really got it.

00:46:40.950 --> 00:46:42.760
You've got it down
as a chunk, and that

00:46:42.760 --> 00:46:47.600
can help build your
knowledge of the material.

00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:51.460
Now, probably the most
valuable technique

00:46:51.460 --> 00:46:54.680
when you're trying to really
understand something difficult

00:46:54.680 --> 00:46:56.800
is simple recall.

00:46:56.800 --> 00:47:01.030
When you're reading material
on a page, you read away,

00:47:01.030 --> 00:47:03.020
and your tendency
is to-- well, I'm

00:47:03.020 --> 00:47:04.780
going to underline it, right?

00:47:04.780 --> 00:47:07.250
Because when you're hand
is moving on the page,

00:47:07.250 --> 00:47:09.760
you think it's moving it
into your brain somehow.

00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:11.680
But it actually is not.

00:47:11.680 --> 00:47:13.360
So resist the urge.

00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:15.460
You can do a little
bit of underlining.

00:47:15.460 --> 00:47:18.680
But it's better to write
it, because you're helping

00:47:18.680 --> 00:47:21.000
to neurally encode these ideas.

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:24.810
And then when you
read the page, simply

00:47:24.810 --> 00:47:28.080
look away and see
what you can recall.

00:47:28.080 --> 00:47:32.020
That, as it turns out, is
very powerful in building

00:47:32.020 --> 00:47:35.160
your understanding of
the material in a way

00:47:35.160 --> 00:47:39.560
that other techniques, including
mind mapping and re-reading--

00:47:39.560 --> 00:47:42.370
they're not nearly
as good as recall.

00:47:42.370 --> 00:47:47.910
So another very important
aspect is simply

00:47:47.910 --> 00:47:51.990
to study judiciously
with other people,

00:47:51.990 --> 00:47:54.460
or talk about what you're
trying to understand

00:47:54.460 --> 00:47:56.040
with other people.

00:47:56.040 --> 00:47:58.540
Now, this has to be
done judiciously.

00:47:58.540 --> 00:48:01.610
Obviously, all learning
does not take place

00:48:01.610 --> 00:48:03.470
in a cooperative fashion.

00:48:03.470 --> 00:48:05.190
Sometimes you have to go off.

00:48:05.190 --> 00:48:07.630
But when you're
learning something sort

00:48:07.630 --> 00:48:10.530
of in focused mode,
there's a part-and-parcel

00:48:10.530 --> 00:48:13.100
of that focused mode,
and that is a feeling

00:48:13.100 --> 00:48:16.760
that what you've just
learned is correct, right?

00:48:16.760 --> 00:48:19.090
This sort of rightness feeling.

00:48:19.090 --> 00:48:24.770
And the only way you can really
disabuse yourself, sometimes,

00:48:24.770 --> 00:48:28.130
is to go off and bounce your
ideas off of other people.

00:48:28.130 --> 00:48:32.790
And they can almost serve like
a greater kind of diffuse mode,

00:48:32.790 --> 00:48:36.890
to help disabuse you when
you do make mistakes.

00:48:36.890 --> 00:48:41.090
So judicious studying with
friends and conversation

00:48:41.090 --> 00:48:44.280
with colleagues can
be incredibly helpful.

00:48:44.280 --> 00:48:49.380
Also, explain in a way that
a 10-year-old can understand.

00:48:49.380 --> 00:48:52.800
So frequently we
explain electricity,

00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:56.430
the flow of electricity, as
water, the flow of water.

00:48:56.430 --> 00:48:57.440
It's an analogy.

00:48:57.440 --> 00:48:58.560
It breaks down.

00:48:58.560 --> 00:49:00.580
All analogies break down.

00:49:00.580 --> 00:49:05.090
But Richard Feynman, the
Nobel Prize-winning physicist,

00:49:05.090 --> 00:49:09.130
used to go around and challenge
top mathematicians in the world

00:49:09.130 --> 00:49:12.750
to explain in a simple
way, like in a way

00:49:12.750 --> 00:49:14.490
that their grandmothers
could understand,

00:49:14.490 --> 00:49:15.490
what they were doing.

00:49:15.490 --> 00:49:16.770
And you know what?

00:49:16.770 --> 00:49:18.120
They could.

00:49:18.120 --> 00:49:20.500
So this means that no
matter how difficult

00:49:20.500 --> 00:49:22.820
that problem is that
you're working on,

00:49:22.820 --> 00:49:25.770
if you find a way to
explain it simply,

00:49:25.770 --> 00:49:29.400
you'll be able to understand
it much more deeply.

00:49:29.400 --> 00:49:33.010
One thing to do
is insert yourself

00:49:33.010 --> 00:49:35.260
into whatever the problem is.

00:49:35.260 --> 00:49:40.970
Like, here I am in a
copper matrix, right?

00:49:40.970 --> 00:49:46.070
Barbara McClintock, the Nobel
Prize-winning geneticist,

00:49:46.070 --> 00:49:49.530
used to kind of imagine herself
down at a genetic level,

00:49:49.530 --> 00:49:53.100
so she could understand and see
how the genes might actually

00:49:53.100 --> 00:49:54.200
be operating.

00:49:54.200 --> 00:49:57.130
So that's a trick that's often
used by some of the greatest

00:49:57.130 --> 00:49:57.860
thinkers.

00:49:57.860 --> 00:50:00.010
Try to find a way
to get yourself

00:50:00.010 --> 00:50:03.200
into almost like
a play, whatever

00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:05.240
you're trying to understand.

00:50:05.240 --> 00:50:08.080
If you want some more
information about what

00:50:08.080 --> 00:50:10.860
I've talked about here,
there's much more in the book,

00:50:10.860 --> 00:50:12.140
"A Mind For Numbers."

00:50:12.140 --> 00:50:15.190
And there's a lot
more-- and it's all

00:50:15.190 --> 00:50:17.770
free-- in the
Massive Open Online

00:50:17.770 --> 00:50:21.860
Course for Coursera, through
UC San Diego, Learning

00:50:21.860 --> 00:50:23.490
How to Learn.

00:50:23.490 --> 00:50:30.510
And that is the key,
except for one thing.

00:50:30.510 --> 00:50:33.310
I'd like to leave you
with this last thought.

00:50:33.310 --> 00:50:38.540
We're often told,
follow your passion.

00:50:38.540 --> 00:50:40.320
That is the key to everything.

00:50:40.320 --> 00:50:43.170
Just follow your passion,
and your life will really

00:50:43.170 --> 00:50:45.120
be a better place for it.

00:50:45.120 --> 00:50:47.430
We're told that.

00:50:47.430 --> 00:50:51.740
But some things--
your passion develops

00:50:51.740 --> 00:50:54.120
about what you really good at.

00:50:54.120 --> 00:50:59.120
And some things take much
longer to get good at.

00:50:59.120 --> 00:51:02.840
So don't just follow
your passions.

00:51:02.840 --> 00:51:05.300
Broaden your passions.

00:51:05.300 --> 00:51:08.310
And your lives will
be greatly enriched.

00:51:08.310 --> 00:51:10.431
Thank you very much.

00:51:10.431 --> 00:51:12.916
[APPLAUSE]

00:51:14.410 --> 00:51:16.590
MALE SPEAKER: Thanks, Barb,
for the fantastic talk.

00:51:16.590 --> 00:51:19.014
Now we'll open it up for
a few questions for Barb.

00:51:19.014 --> 00:51:20.930
Please raise your hand
if you have a question,

00:51:20.930 --> 00:51:23.090
and I'll bring the
mic over to you.

00:51:23.090 --> 00:51:24.490
AUDIENCE: So one
of the questions

00:51:24.490 --> 00:51:29.110
I had was that, you know,
whenever learning things

00:51:29.110 --> 00:51:31.240
and tackling tough
problems, people always

00:51:31.240 --> 00:51:34.580
say, well, break it
down into smaller parts

00:51:34.580 --> 00:51:36.430
that you know how to do.

00:51:36.430 --> 00:51:39.520
And so I wondered how that fits
into the focused and diffuse

00:51:39.520 --> 00:51:40.020
mode.

00:51:40.020 --> 00:51:43.650
Because that seems kind of
like breaking a diffuse problem

00:51:43.650 --> 00:51:46.150
into a bunch of
focused problems.

00:51:49.170 --> 00:51:51.370
BARBARA OAKLEY: Actually,
what that really relates

00:51:51.370 --> 00:51:54.730
to is that idea of chunks.

00:51:54.730 --> 00:52:01.150
So remember that you've got
four slots in working memory.

00:52:01.150 --> 00:52:06.010
The more you can understand
one simple part of it

00:52:06.010 --> 00:52:08.770
and make it into
a chunk, and then

00:52:08.770 --> 00:52:11.060
another little aspect
of it, and make that

00:52:11.060 --> 00:52:15.300
into a chunk, and
then another one,

00:52:15.300 --> 00:52:17.730
so you're focusing to do that.

00:52:17.730 --> 00:52:20.920
And then in diffuse mode,
you reaching up above

00:52:20.920 --> 00:52:23.500
and making the
connection randomly,

00:52:23.500 --> 00:52:26.600
when you're sleeping, out
for a walk, taking a shower,

00:52:26.600 --> 00:52:28.300
all these kinds of things.

00:52:28.300 --> 00:52:33.890
So they all are related, but
actually, that's great advice.

00:52:33.890 --> 00:52:37.480
If you try to learn it all at
once, it's so overwhelming,

00:52:37.480 --> 00:52:40.410
it's like your little prefrontal
cortex is scrambling madly,

00:52:40.410 --> 00:52:41.760
but it's overwhelmed.

00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:43.590
So you want to just
get a piece of it,

00:52:43.590 --> 00:52:46.410
so you can draw
that up as a ribbon.

00:52:46.410 --> 00:52:48.090
Very good question.

00:52:48.090 --> 00:52:50.540
AUDIENCE: A chunk
requires understanding.

00:52:50.540 --> 00:52:53.160
So when there is a
chunk, that means

00:52:53.160 --> 00:52:56.210
that there was an experience of
understanding that led to that?

00:52:56.210 --> 00:52:57.850
BARBARA OAKLEY: Not necessarily.

00:52:57.850 --> 00:53:02.160
You can learn a
word in a language,

00:53:02.160 --> 00:53:04.210
and you can not know
what that word means.

00:53:04.210 --> 00:53:06.690
And you can learn a lot
of words in a language,

00:53:06.690 --> 00:53:09.360
but not know what that means.

00:53:09.360 --> 00:53:12.680
But if you do know
what they mean,

00:53:12.680 --> 00:53:15.560
it actually can make it
easier to remember that word,

00:53:15.560 --> 00:53:17.650
and easier to chunk that word.

00:53:17.650 --> 00:53:23.970
And easier to use those chunks,
to put together sentences.

00:53:23.970 --> 00:53:27.790
So for the most
part, we always want

00:53:27.790 --> 00:53:31.360
chunking to involve
understanding, as well.

00:53:31.360 --> 00:53:33.120
But technically, no.

00:53:33.120 --> 00:53:35.160
You don't have to
have understanding.

00:53:35.160 --> 00:53:37.830
It's just that understanding
helps to kind of knit things

00:53:37.830 --> 00:53:41.920
together so that you can
remember them more easily.

00:53:41.920 --> 00:53:46.100
For example, if I'm trying to
learn the word duck as "pato"

00:53:46.100 --> 00:53:52.290
in Spanish, if I'm
just going "pato,"

00:53:52.290 --> 00:53:53.940
I'm trying to
remember that word,

00:53:53.940 --> 00:53:55.940
I don't have any understanding
of what it means,

00:53:55.940 --> 00:53:57.940
it's kind of harder to remember.

00:53:57.940 --> 00:54:02.040
But if I know that "pato"
means duck, I can say,

00:54:02.040 --> 00:54:06.000
what if I'm trying to remember
it by having a little "pot-o"

00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:10.050
that my duck is floating
in, and that can help,

00:54:10.050 --> 00:54:12.810
that understanding, help
serve as a bridge to get it

00:54:12.810 --> 00:54:14.280
into my mind.

00:54:14.280 --> 00:54:18.590
So that's a really good
question, because people often

00:54:18.590 --> 00:54:20.100
think, oh, you
build a chunk, it's

00:54:20.100 --> 00:54:21.730
automatic that
you understand it.

00:54:21.730 --> 00:54:23.620
Not necessarily.

00:54:23.620 --> 00:54:27.050
But it's a very good thing
to have, for the most part.

00:54:27.050 --> 00:54:27.550
I

00:54:27.550 --> 00:54:28.925
AUDIENCE: I wanted
to ask-- we've

00:54:28.925 --> 00:54:31.480
mentioned that people
who've mastered one area

00:54:31.480 --> 00:54:34.620
can find it easier to
learn another area,

00:54:34.620 --> 00:54:36.710
because they're related chunks.

00:54:36.710 --> 00:54:39.790
BARBARA OAKLEY: Depending
on how close the area is.

00:54:39.790 --> 00:54:42.230
If you learn Icelandic,
you're probably

00:54:42.230 --> 00:54:45.270
going to be able to
learn German more easily.

00:54:45.270 --> 00:54:48.070
But it may help a
little bit with some

00:54:48.070 --> 00:54:49.682
of the metacognitive
skills, as far as

00:54:49.682 --> 00:54:51.390
when you're learning
Chinese, but they're

00:54:51.390 --> 00:54:56.320
so very different that it's
only those metacognitive sort

00:54:56.320 --> 00:54:59.560
of things that might
help with learning.

00:54:59.560 --> 00:55:03.034
And there's still a little bit
of an aspect of fundamental

00:55:03.034 --> 00:55:04.950
"how do you structure a
language" that I think

00:55:04.950 --> 00:55:06.090
is common to all languages.

00:55:09.190 --> 00:55:11.750
So it depends on how
close things are.

00:55:11.750 --> 00:55:18.730
But what I think is fascinating
is that you never know.

00:55:18.730 --> 00:55:20.570
That's why it's so
important to have

00:55:20.570 --> 00:55:25.330
people coming from one field to
a very different field, right?

00:55:25.330 --> 00:55:28.900
You're a deep sea diver,
and you go into nursing.

00:55:28.900 --> 00:55:32.570
And you actually can bring
some really good ideas.

00:55:32.570 --> 00:55:35.240
And the best ideas
are often developed

00:55:35.240 --> 00:55:37.430
by two different
types of people.

00:55:37.430 --> 00:55:39.980
One is someone who's
very young, so they

00:55:39.980 --> 00:55:41.870
haven't been sort
of indoctrinated

00:55:41.870 --> 00:55:43.630
into "this is how you think."

00:55:43.630 --> 00:55:46.580
But the other is
outsiders, people

00:55:46.580 --> 00:55:51.200
who are trained in a different
discipline, who come and take

00:55:51.200 --> 00:55:55.340
an initial look and have fresh
eyes at what they're seeing.

00:55:55.340 --> 00:55:57.112
So, good questions.

00:55:57.112 --> 00:55:57.820
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:55:57.820 --> 00:55:59.472
AUDIENCE: Maybe a
more practical thing.

00:55:59.472 --> 00:56:01.180
I'm curious about your
opinion, if you're

00:56:01.180 --> 00:56:05.230
familiar with the Everyday
Math curriculum which

00:56:05.230 --> 00:56:08.050
a lot of schools are teaching
now, which, for example,

00:56:08.050 --> 00:56:08.790
my kids take.

00:56:08.790 --> 00:56:11.320
And for example,
when they teach math,

00:56:11.320 --> 00:56:14.310
they emphasize
getting sort of almost

00:56:14.310 --> 00:56:15.651
like a number theory feel.

00:56:15.651 --> 00:56:17.400
Like they learn, like,
four different ways

00:56:17.400 --> 00:56:20.160
to multiply instead of one,
you know, the way we learned.

00:56:20.160 --> 00:56:22.430
And so for example,
my kids, they're

00:56:22.430 --> 00:56:24.754
incredibly confused by this.

00:56:24.754 --> 00:56:26.670
I'm just wondering if
you're familiar with it.

00:56:26.670 --> 00:56:28.700
If you have-- how
does it fit into this,

00:56:28.700 --> 00:56:32.560
and if you think
that's-- have opinions.

00:56:32.560 --> 00:56:34.770
BARBARA OAKLEY: It's
different in different parts

00:56:34.770 --> 00:56:35.540
of the country.

00:56:35.540 --> 00:56:37.040
And so I'm out of Michigan.

00:56:37.040 --> 00:56:40.800
We have different techniques.

00:56:40.800 --> 00:56:41.680
It depends.

00:56:41.680 --> 00:56:43.700
I think it depends on the kids.

00:56:43.700 --> 00:56:45.790
For some kids,
it's great to learn

00:56:45.790 --> 00:56:47.760
all these different techniques.

00:56:47.760 --> 00:56:51.990
For other kids, you
know, just get one method

00:56:51.990 --> 00:56:57.080
down really well, and then
you can climb up from there.

00:56:57.080 --> 00:57:01.500
My own personal opinion
is one of the best

00:57:01.500 --> 00:57:05.500
math supplement programs is
simply Kumon Mathematics.

00:57:05.500 --> 00:57:09.000
And I'm not a paid spokesperson
for Kumon Mathematics.

00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:14.320
But what they do is they have
simple methods of practice

00:57:14.320 --> 00:57:17.970
and repetition to
help build mastery

00:57:17.970 --> 00:57:20.230
in your learning of mathematics.

00:57:20.230 --> 00:57:22.950
And they don't give you a
bunch of different methods.

00:57:22.950 --> 00:57:25.140
They just make sure you
know how to multiply.

00:57:25.140 --> 00:57:27.530
You know how to divide.

00:57:27.530 --> 00:57:31.710
And you really know
how to do these things.

00:57:31.710 --> 00:57:35.440
So I guess my gut sense,
and I haven't really

00:57:35.440 --> 00:57:36.960
encountered that
question before,

00:57:36.960 --> 00:57:41.150
is I think I'd prefer to see
someone really learn it well

00:57:41.150 --> 00:57:42.170
using one technique.

00:57:42.170 --> 00:57:45.790
When you're older, you
can see other ways.

00:57:45.790 --> 00:57:50.630
But if you've got that one
way really good, you got it,

00:57:50.630 --> 00:57:52.410
and you can move up.

00:57:52.410 --> 00:57:56.570
But if you're learning too
many, it can be quite confusing.

00:57:56.570 --> 00:57:58.860
I suppose it would be
the equivalent of you're

00:57:58.860 --> 00:58:01.825
growing up learning
eight languages at once.

00:58:01.825 --> 00:58:04.730
You know, some
kids can handle it.

00:58:04.730 --> 00:58:08.350
But for a lot of kids, it
might be a little bit confusing

00:58:08.350 --> 00:58:11.590
to have too much going on at
one time, especially about

00:58:11.590 --> 00:58:12.680
one thing.

00:58:12.680 --> 00:58:15.890
AUDIENCE: I have a
question around reading,

00:58:15.890 --> 00:58:18.180
and not like math or
something, but if I'm

00:58:18.180 --> 00:58:21.690
reading, say, a philosophy
book by Nietzsche or Heidegger,

00:58:21.690 --> 00:58:24.460
for example, which
is 400 pages long.

00:58:24.460 --> 00:58:26.250
And I'm a slow reader.

00:58:26.250 --> 00:58:28.850
And I'm assuming I'm
a very focused reader,

00:58:28.850 --> 00:58:32.810
because I do grasp and retain
what I have read pretty well.

00:58:32.810 --> 00:58:34.750
But I'm incredibly slow.

00:58:34.750 --> 00:58:40.090
So do have any methods to figure
out how to be a fast reader,

00:58:40.090 --> 00:58:42.150
but at the same time,
be able to retain

00:58:42.150 --> 00:58:45.470
and deeply grasp
what I'm reading?

00:58:45.470 --> 00:58:48.350
BARBARA OAKLEY: The
short answer is no.

00:58:48.350 --> 00:58:52.600
Research has lately shown that
techniques for speed reading

00:58:52.600 --> 00:58:57.220
are actually-- they're
a little bit, it seems,

00:58:57.220 --> 00:58:59.120
somewhat spurious.

00:58:59.120 --> 00:59:04.800
To read anything difficult
more deeply simply takes time.

00:59:04.800 --> 00:59:07.310
I always think, in
the back of my mind,

00:59:07.310 --> 00:59:10.160
STEM disciplines-- Science,
Technology, Engineering,

00:59:10.160 --> 00:59:13.300
Math-- is really difficult
for a lot of people.

00:59:13.300 --> 00:59:16.690
But then there's philosophy.

00:59:16.690 --> 00:59:19.770
That's, I think, one of the
hardest things in general

00:59:19.770 --> 00:59:21.960
for people to really grasp.

00:59:21.960 --> 00:59:25.010
It's incredibly important,
but it's difficult.

00:59:25.010 --> 00:59:28.510
And I think just having a little
understanding and compassion

00:59:28.510 --> 00:59:30.200
for yourself, that
you're actually

00:59:30.200 --> 00:59:34.490
tackling among humankind's
most difficult topics.

00:59:34.490 --> 00:59:39.480
And if it's slow, well,
you're doing fantastic.

00:59:39.480 --> 00:59:40.850
Because I would be the same way.

00:59:40.850 --> 00:59:43.340
And I think a lot of people
are really the same way.

00:59:43.340 --> 00:59:46.850
There's some probably super-fast
Maserati brain thinkers

00:59:46.850 --> 00:59:49.080
who could buzz right
through that stuff.

00:59:49.080 --> 00:59:51.250
But they would miss
things that you would see.

00:59:51.250 --> 00:59:54.240
AUDIENCE: I've been wondering
how your techniques apply

00:59:54.240 --> 00:59:55.534
more generally to kids.

00:59:55.534 --> 00:59:56.950
And you briefly
touched, actually,

00:59:56.950 --> 00:59:59.260
on a previous question, practice
and repetition, practice

00:59:59.260 --> 00:59:59.910
and repetition.

00:59:59.910 --> 01:00:02.310
But more concretely, how
do you get, actually,

01:00:02.310 --> 01:00:04.010
kids interested
in mathematics, so

01:00:04.010 --> 01:00:05.634
that they keep on practicing?

01:00:05.634 --> 01:00:07.050
BARBARA OAKLEY:
The way that we've

01:00:07.050 --> 01:00:09.910
been teaching kids
is, it's like,

01:00:09.910 --> 01:00:12.310
let's give them introduced
to the fun stuff.

01:00:12.310 --> 01:00:14.140
We're going have them
hands on, and we're

01:00:14.140 --> 01:00:16.100
going to have them
dropping eggs, and doing

01:00:16.100 --> 01:00:17.150
all this exciting stuff.

01:00:17.150 --> 01:00:19.850
And then they get to college,
and they hit calculus,

01:00:19.850 --> 01:00:22.850
and it's like the
death march, right?

01:00:22.850 --> 01:00:24.540
They start dropping like flies.

01:00:24.540 --> 01:00:26.620
Because they're
not used to that.

01:00:26.620 --> 01:00:29.030
Everything's always
been fun, right?

01:00:29.030 --> 01:00:33.010
So we don't do that when we're
teaching things like music.

01:00:33.010 --> 01:00:36.290
We don't do that when we're
teaching foreign languages.

01:00:36.290 --> 01:00:39.830
But students fall in
love with those subjects

01:00:39.830 --> 01:00:43.090
because they can gain
the expertise-- in part

01:00:43.090 --> 01:00:46.920
through some drudging through
practice and repetition.

01:00:46.920 --> 01:00:49.520
So I think part of
the reason that we

01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:54.100
have so many kids in this
country fall off the bandwagon

01:00:54.100 --> 01:00:57.270
is we try to make everything
really exciting and really fun.

01:00:57.270 --> 01:01:00.740
And we forget the lessons
that language learners

01:01:00.740 --> 01:01:04.290
and musicians, and
sports, people in sports,

01:01:04.290 --> 01:01:06.330
dance instructors--
they all know

01:01:06.330 --> 01:01:10.280
that practice and repetition
is part of gaining expertise.

01:01:10.280 --> 01:01:12.740
And when we get that
incorporated back

01:01:12.740 --> 01:01:15.260
into the curriculum--
it's there,

01:01:15.260 --> 01:01:19.700
but it's not nearly as sound as
it is in many other countries.

01:01:19.700 --> 01:01:22.350
Which is why I think we
see so many people coming

01:01:22.350 --> 01:01:28.040
to this country with a love
and a mastery of learning

01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:31.970
in science and in mathematics
that is not growing

01:01:31.970 --> 01:01:36.110
organically, because we're not
introducing kids in the United

01:01:36.110 --> 01:01:39.160
States to some of
these ideas of also,

01:01:39.160 --> 01:01:43.260
the supplemental importance
of practice and repetition.

01:01:43.260 --> 01:01:44.840
So those are my thoughts.

01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:48.510
We do do a little bit of
it, but really not enough.

01:01:48.510 --> 01:01:51.030
Because for a long
time, sadly, there's

01:01:51.030 --> 01:01:53.840
been this feeling that too
much practice and repetition

01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:56.440
in mathematics will
kill your creativity.

01:01:56.440 --> 01:02:01.320
Instead of the reality,
which is every great expert

01:02:01.320 --> 01:02:03.940
has to have practice
and repetition

01:02:03.940 --> 01:02:06.380
with what they're learning.

01:02:06.380 --> 01:02:08.710
So those are my
thoughts on that.

01:02:08.710 --> 01:02:10.349
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

01:02:10.349 --> 01:02:10.890
AUDIENCE: Hi.

01:02:10.890 --> 01:02:15.700
So understanding is important,
and context is important.

01:02:15.700 --> 01:02:20.550
And speaking of that, so there
could be like top-down approach

01:02:20.550 --> 01:02:23.650
and bottom-up approach.

01:02:23.650 --> 01:02:24.960
So what do you think is better?

01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:28.220
Is it better to
understand the big picture

01:02:28.220 --> 01:02:30.860
and then try to study subject?

01:02:30.860 --> 01:02:34.660
Or it's better to
study the small chunks

01:02:34.660 --> 01:02:39.190
and build this
understanding from--

01:02:39.190 --> 01:02:41.877
or maybe we have to mix it?

01:02:41.877 --> 01:02:43.710
BARBARA OAKLEY: You've
got it exactly right.

01:02:43.710 --> 01:02:47.110
You don't want to be just doing
small things all the time.

01:02:47.110 --> 01:02:49.850
And you don't want to be
perched overhead all the time.

01:02:49.850 --> 01:02:53.080
You want to be-- it's hard to
get what is the big picture

01:02:53.080 --> 01:02:55.970
when you're-- you learn one
little chunk and you learn

01:02:55.970 --> 01:02:57.290
another little chunk.

01:02:57.290 --> 01:03:00.570
But you want to start piecing
that into the big picture

01:03:00.570 --> 01:03:02.600
as much as you can.

01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:06.310
And so you want to be kind
of going back and forth.

01:03:06.310 --> 01:03:08.520
One of the techniques
that I didn't talk about,

01:03:08.520 --> 01:03:11.510
that's very important,
is that of interleaving.

01:03:11.510 --> 01:03:15.650
And a lot of times, when
you're learning, for example,

01:03:15.650 --> 01:03:18.370
some new technique
in calculus, you'll

01:03:18.370 --> 01:03:23.750
do 10 problems
pretty much the same,

01:03:23.750 --> 01:03:27.320
in learning that
technique in calculus.

01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:29.290
But you don't want to do that.

01:03:29.290 --> 01:03:32.190
You want to do one or two
problems using that technique.

01:03:32.190 --> 01:03:34.080
Flip to another
section of the book.

01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:35.580
Do that problem.

01:03:35.580 --> 01:03:37.126
Kind of compare--
wait a minute, why

01:03:37.126 --> 01:03:40.430
am I using this technique
here and that technique here?

01:03:40.430 --> 01:03:41.710
Why are those different?

01:03:41.710 --> 01:03:42.320
Flip back.

01:03:42.320 --> 01:03:44.950
Do another one of
the first technique.

01:03:44.950 --> 01:03:47.180
Then flip to a
different-- we're not

01:03:47.180 --> 01:03:49.960
training people-- we don't
even have our books set up

01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:51.140
to interleave.

01:03:51.140 --> 01:03:54.100
And we need to start
doing that, because that's

01:03:54.100 --> 01:03:56.520
what actually-- it's
practice of repetition,

01:03:56.520 --> 01:04:00.660
but mixed with interleaving,
that builds flexibility.

01:04:00.660 --> 01:04:03.160
So those are my
thoughts on that.

01:04:03.160 --> 01:04:03.744
Good question.

01:04:03.744 --> 01:04:05.910
AUDIENCE: Like when I was
in high school and college

01:04:05.910 --> 01:04:07.750
and taking math, I
was perfectly fine.

01:04:07.750 --> 01:04:09.940
Like I did well, and
did well on the tests.

01:04:09.940 --> 01:04:11.960
But my problem was
always trying to apply it

01:04:11.960 --> 01:04:14.130
outside that
environment, like trying

01:04:14.130 --> 01:04:15.910
to use it practically
or in everyday life,

01:04:15.910 --> 01:04:18.840
or whatever it was that I
needed certain math skills.

01:04:18.840 --> 01:04:19.950
I just could never do it.

01:04:19.950 --> 01:04:23.280
And I was wondering if you
had any sort of technique

01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:25.770
or strategy or ideas
about how there's a way

01:04:25.770 --> 01:04:29.230
to take math from the
school and sort of be

01:04:29.230 --> 01:04:31.900
able to apply it
in regular life,

01:04:31.900 --> 01:04:35.280
or just outside of school.

01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:38.160
BARBARA OAKLEY: That's
a very good question.

01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:43.290
One of the things that
people do, they look at math

01:04:43.290 --> 01:04:46.390
and they say, how am I
ever going to use this?

01:04:46.390 --> 01:04:48.300
In fact, I remember
when I was called

01:04:48.300 --> 01:04:51.150
into the principal's
office in eighth grade,

01:04:51.150 --> 01:04:53.240
because I wasn't doing my math.

01:04:53.240 --> 01:04:54.520
I was actually reading a book.

01:04:54.520 --> 01:04:57.670
And so I remonstrated
with the principal,

01:04:57.670 --> 01:05:00.270
saying that there was
no real use for it.

01:05:00.270 --> 01:05:02.530
I would never use it.

01:05:02.530 --> 01:05:04.940
And they gave up on
me, at that point.

01:05:04.940 --> 01:05:08.312
But it's kind of like this.

01:05:08.312 --> 01:05:10.410
When you're at
the gym and you're

01:05:10.410 --> 01:05:13.710
lifting a specific
type of weight,

01:05:13.710 --> 01:05:16.760
are you ever going to go
into the outside world

01:05:16.760 --> 01:05:18.840
and lift that kind of weight?

01:05:18.840 --> 01:05:20.000
Of course not.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.350
But you're actually
using muscles

01:05:22.350 --> 01:05:27.690
that you might use related
muscles when you're lifting up

01:05:27.690 --> 01:05:32.110
your luggage to get in and put
it in the airline compartment.

01:05:32.110 --> 01:05:34.830
So what you're doing when
you're learning something

01:05:34.830 --> 01:05:38.530
in math and science
is you're developing

01:05:38.530 --> 01:05:41.050
sort of neural pathways.

01:05:41.050 --> 01:05:45.320
You may not use exactly that
one, but in surprising ways,

01:05:45.320 --> 01:05:48.420
they can shape how you're
thinking about things.

01:05:48.420 --> 01:05:50.890
So an example is this.

01:05:50.890 --> 01:05:53.550
They did a study, and
they found, you know,

01:05:53.550 --> 01:05:57.190
there's some kids who go
all the way through college.

01:05:57.190 --> 01:06:03.790
And you can kind of take courses
that have almost no math,

01:06:03.790 --> 01:06:05.160
really, involved.

01:06:05.160 --> 01:06:08.650
You know, math for poets,
or i these kinds of courses.

01:06:08.650 --> 01:06:11.100
And you go all the way through.

01:06:11.100 --> 01:06:14.340
But people who have
this kind of background,

01:06:14.340 --> 01:06:17.670
where they've had very little
exposure, when you control

01:06:17.670 --> 01:06:21.750
for all aspects of what's going
on that you can reasonably

01:06:21.750 --> 01:06:27.180
control for, the ones who have
no real background in math

01:06:27.180 --> 01:06:31.320
are far more likely to default
on their home mortgages.

01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:33.220
So you know, think about that.

01:06:33.220 --> 01:06:36.300
But it's actually, you're able
to think more intelligently.

01:06:36.300 --> 01:06:40.770
Now, what about--
you're really concerned

01:06:40.770 --> 01:06:42.370
about the environment.

01:06:42.370 --> 01:06:45.610
So someone comes up
and says, well, we've

01:06:45.610 --> 01:06:48.360
got to have electric cars.

01:06:48.360 --> 01:06:50.440
Sounds really good, right?

01:06:50.440 --> 01:06:53.400
But if you're trained, you've
got some kind of background,

01:06:53.400 --> 01:06:55.260
you could go, yeah,
but wait a minute.

01:06:55.260 --> 01:06:58.170
What about the
effect of batteries

01:06:58.170 --> 01:06:59.770
on the environment, right?

01:06:59.770 --> 01:07:02.120
Do they actually
make more pollution?

01:07:02.120 --> 01:07:05.470
In fact, does that
transfer of energy

01:07:05.470 --> 01:07:07.980
create more harm
for the environment

01:07:07.980 --> 01:07:10.070
than a regular gasoline engine?

01:07:10.070 --> 01:07:14.360
If you're taught to think a
little bit more rationally

01:07:14.360 --> 01:07:16.990
and carefully about
things, you can actually--

01:07:16.990 --> 01:07:19.880
you're using those
intellectual muscles in ways

01:07:19.880 --> 01:07:22.080
that you haven't
really-- you don't really

01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:25.010
realize how important
that actually is.

01:07:25.010 --> 01:07:28.829
So one way, though,
just reflecting,

01:07:28.829 --> 01:07:30.370
just a little bit
of a different way,

01:07:30.370 --> 01:07:32.550
because your
question's very deep.

01:07:32.550 --> 01:07:35.340
When you're learning a language,
one of the things you do

01:07:35.340 --> 01:07:38.260
is you're learning,
you're practicing.

01:07:38.260 --> 01:07:42.350
And it can be really tough
to actually go and meet

01:07:42.350 --> 01:07:46.880
somebody and talk with them,
who speaks that language.

01:07:46.880 --> 01:07:51.310
But that real life experience is
what brings the language alive,

01:07:51.310 --> 01:07:54.930
and what nourishes the
desire to learn it.

01:07:54.930 --> 01:07:58.724
So I think finding ways--
when you're walking around

01:07:58.724 --> 01:08:00.890
and you're thinking about
something you just learned

01:08:00.890 --> 01:08:04.820
mathematically, look
around and try and bring it

01:08:04.820 --> 01:08:07.540
into the environment you're in.

01:08:07.540 --> 01:08:10.120
And try to think about
it in those ways.

01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:12.030
That's such a great question.

01:08:12.030 --> 01:08:17.569
Because it helps us be aware of
the richness of life around us.

01:08:17.569 --> 01:08:20.500
And so I think trying to bring
some of these ideas you're

01:08:20.500 --> 01:08:25.710
learning into the life around
us is a brilliant thing to do,

01:08:25.710 --> 01:08:28.670
and a great attitude to have.

01:08:28.670 --> 01:08:31.949
So I thank you so very
much for having me here.

01:08:31.949 --> 01:08:33.240
BARBARA OAKLEY: Fantastic talk.

01:08:33.240 --> 01:08:33.910

01:08:34.529 --> 01:08:35.350

you so much, Barb.

01:08:35.350 --> 01:08:35.950
