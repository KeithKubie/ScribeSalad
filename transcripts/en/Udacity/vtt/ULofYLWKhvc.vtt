00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Okay--so we had our request line that looks something like this,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
followed by a number of headers.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Headers have this format: name: value.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Let's add some headers.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
When you make a request, all of this is sent at once--

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
the request line, followed by number of headers.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.000
These aren't the only headers that are sent,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
but these are some of the more popular ones.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.000
The first one is called host,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and this is from the URL--this is the host part of the URL.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
It's required in HTTP/1.1.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
It's not strictly required in 1.0.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
But--why is this useful?

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
We're already connecting to the machine,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
so why do we need to say what the host is again.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.000
It would be like if you came up to me and said,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
"Steve, what is your name?"

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Obviously you already know my name,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.000
so why are you asking?

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Well--it's because web servers may have multiple names.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
One machine, one web server can host the website

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
for many websites.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
For example with Udacity.com,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
which is hosted on Google's app engine,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
each of those machines hosts many websites.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
So, we need to say which website we're requesting

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.000
a document for.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
The next header--this one is called user agent.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
This describes--basically--who is making the request.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
This is generally your browser.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Your browser will put its name in there,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
and there's also some version info and things like that.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
And this is really helpful for the server so they know

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
what type of machine is making the request.
