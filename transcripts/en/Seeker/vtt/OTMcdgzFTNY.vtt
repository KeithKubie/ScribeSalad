00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:01.190
Son of a beach!

00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:09.440
I’m sorry to tell you a sad whale of a tail,

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.500
hey everyone, Julia here for DNews

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.790
Recently over 200 whales washed up on a beach
in New Zealand.

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:19.500
They face injury and death from dehydration.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.880
Unfortunately almost 20 died and the rescuers
have to wait until high tide to try again

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.160
to rescue the rest.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.190
So why does this happen?

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:29.070
Well it seems beachings aren’t a new thing.

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.770
There’s evidence of mass beachings going
back to Aristotle.

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:35.640
He said: "It is not known why they sometimes
run aground on the seashore: for it is asserted

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.390
that this happens rather fre­quently when
the fancy takes them and without any apparent

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.390
reason.

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.149
Well scientists think they have a few reasons..

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:47.320
One idea suggests that maybe whales chase
prey and accidently get caught up in the tide.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.739
Yet this theory doesn’t hold much water.

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.499
Too many whales end up with on a beach with
an empty stomach.

00:00:52.499 --> 00:00:55.679
And deep sea whales are more likely to strand
themselves than those who spend more time

00:00:55.679 --> 00:00:57.449
closer to shore, like orcas.

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.019
Maybe they’re just following their friends.

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:02.350
Whales are incredibly social creatures.

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.649
Perhaps one whale is sick or injured and heads
to shallow water to take refuge.

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:09.200
Perhaps the tide comes in and the whale winds
up on a beach.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.380
The other animals hear its distress calls
and come to the rescue, but get stranded themselves.

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.380
Yet some genetic testing showed a diversity
in the animals and those next to each other

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:15.380
weren’t necessarily closely related and
they found a surprising lack of mothers for

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:16.380
some of the beached babies.

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.380
This suggests a lack of social cohesion perhaps
indicating a different cause.

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:18.380
Another reason for beachings might be toxic
algae.

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.740
A study published in the Proceedings of the
Royal Society B found repeated ancient beachings

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.930
dating 6-9 million years ago.

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.000
To explain the repeated nature of the event,
they looked to a current explanation.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.070
Toxic algae blooms, called “red tides”
contributed to the death and washing up of

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.000
humpback whales on the coast of cape cod in
the 80s.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.039
Another idea of repeated stranding spots,
links the coastline to the deaths.

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:43.170
Researchers from the University of Western
Australia, think whales echolocation can’t

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:49.509
see gentle sloping shores, and sometimes rough
winds or surf scramble it too.

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:51.500
One theory, blames us.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.850
Evidence of sonar causing beaching started
gathering in 2000, when a sonar test by the

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:57.869
US Navy killed 17 whales.

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:03.009
A medical exam showed the sonar was so loud,
it triggered massive bleeding around the ears.

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:06.840
Other exams in other beachings showed of a
kind of depression sickness, just like the

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.660
bends in humans, in some whales.

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.910
A 2008 stranding of 100 melon headed whales
on a beach in madagascar was caused by high-frequency

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.730
mapping sonar systems, the animals probably
tried to avoid the weird sound so they moved

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.640
into an unfamiliar and as it turned out, unsafe
area.

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.610
