00:00:08.792 --> 00:00:13.288
James Joyce's "Ulysses" is widely considered
to be both a literary masterpiece

00:00:13.288 --> 00:00:16.977
and one of the hardest works
of literature to read.

00:00:16.977 --> 00:00:21.014
It inspires such devotion that once a year
on a day called Bloomsday,

00:00:21.014 --> 00:00:24.908
thousands of people all over the world
dress up like the characters,

00:00:24.908 --> 00:00:26.381
take to the streets,

00:00:26.381 --> 00:00:28.767
and read the book aloud.

00:00:28.767 --> 00:00:31.272
And some even make a pilgrimage
to Dublin

00:00:31.272 --> 00:00:36.113
just to visit the places so vividly
depicted in Joyce's opus.

00:00:36.113 --> 00:00:38.920
So what is it about this famously
difficult novel

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.029
that inspires so many people?

00:00:42.029 --> 00:00:44.640
There's no one simple answer
to that question,

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.138
but there are a few remarkable things
about the book

00:00:47.138 --> 00:00:49.738
that keep people coming back.

00:00:49.738 --> 00:00:52.938
The plot, which transpires over
the course of a single day,

00:00:52.938 --> 00:00:55.408
is a story of three characters:

00:00:55.408 --> 00:00:58.580
Stephen Dedalus, reprised from 
Joyce's earlier novel,

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:01.478
"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man";

00:01:01.478 --> 00:01:06.558
Leopold Bloom, a half-Jewish advertising
canvasser for a Dublin newspaper;

00:01:06.558 --> 00:01:11.457
and Bloom's wife Molly, who is about
to embark on an affair.

00:01:11.457 --> 00:01:14.905
Stephen is depressed because
of his mother's recent death.

00:01:14.905 --> 00:01:17.369
Meanwhile, Bloom wanders 
throughout the city.

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:18.940
He goes to a funeral,

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:19.780
his work,

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:20.544
a pub,

00:01:20.544 --> 00:01:21.581
and so on,

00:01:21.581 --> 00:01:26.010
avoiding going home because Molly
is about to begin her affair.

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:28.451
Where it really starts 
to get interesting, though,

00:01:28.451 --> 00:01:30.923
is how the story's told.

00:01:30.923 --> 00:01:33.649
Each chapter is written 
in a different style.

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:35.410
15 is a play,

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:38.150
13 is like a cheesy romance novel,

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:43.290
12 is a story with bizarre,
exaggerated interruptions,

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.671
11 uses techniques, like onomatopoeia,
repetitions, and alliteration

00:01:47.671 --> 00:01:49.842
to imitate music,

00:01:49.842 --> 00:01:54.829
and 14 reproduces the evolution
of English literary prose style,

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:59.931
from its beginnings in Anglo-Saxon
right up to the 20th century.

00:01:59.931 --> 00:02:02.291
That all culminates in the final chapter

00:02:02.291 --> 00:02:05.110
which follows Molly's 
stream of consciousness

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.752
as it spools out in just 
eight long paragraphs

00:02:08.752 --> 00:02:11.332
with almost no punctuation.

00:02:11.332 --> 00:02:13.812
The range of styles
Joyce uses in "Ulysses"

00:02:13.812 --> 00:02:16.513
is one of the things 
that makes it so difficult,

00:02:16.513 --> 00:02:18.913
but it also helps make it enjoyable.

00:02:18.913 --> 00:02:21.483
And it's one of the reasons that
the book is held up

00:02:21.483 --> 00:02:24.443
as one of the key texts 
of literary modernism,

00:02:24.443 --> 00:02:30.213
a movement characterized by overturning
traditional modes of writing.

00:02:30.213 --> 00:02:32.753
Joyce fills his narrative 
gymnastic routines

00:02:32.753 --> 00:02:37.132
with some of the most imaginative 
use of language you'll find anywhere.

00:02:37.132 --> 00:02:38.962
Take, for instance,

00:02:38.962 --> 00:02:42.992
"The figure seated on a large boulder 
at the foot of a round tower

00:02:42.992 --> 00:02:48.422
was that of a broadshouldered deepchested 
stronglimbed frankeyed redhaired

00:02:48.422 --> 00:02:54.383
freelyfreckled shaggybearded widemouthed 
largenosed longheaded deepvoiced

00:02:54.383 --> 00:03:00.435
barekneed brawnyhanded hairlegged
ruddyfaced sinewyarmed hero."

00:03:00.435 --> 00:03:04.364
Here, Joyce exaggerates the description
of a mangy old man in a pub

00:03:04.364 --> 00:03:08.444
to make him seem like an improbably
gigantesque hero.

00:03:08.444 --> 00:03:12.403
It's true that some sections 
are impenetrably dense at first glance,

00:03:12.403 --> 00:03:15.265
but it's up to the reader 
to let their eyes skim over them

00:03:15.265 --> 00:03:18.754
or break out a shovel and dig in.

00:03:18.754 --> 00:03:20.906
And once you start excavating the text,

00:03:20.906 --> 00:03:24.325
you'll find the book to be an encyclopedic
treasure trove.

00:03:24.325 --> 00:03:27.344
It's filled with all manner of references
and allusions

00:03:27.344 --> 00:03:30.287
from medieval philosophy
to the symbolism of tattoos,

00:03:30.287 --> 00:03:33.446
and from Dante to Dublin slang.

00:03:33.446 --> 00:03:37.837
As suggested by the title, some of these
allusions revolve around Homer's "Odyssey."

00:03:37.837 --> 00:03:41.940
Each chapter is named after a character
or episode from the "Odyssey,"

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:47.966
but the literary references are often
coy, debatable, sarcastic, or disguised.

00:03:47.966 --> 00:03:51.881
For example, Homer's Odysseus,
after an epic 20-year-long journey,

00:03:51.881 --> 00:03:56.565
returns home to Ithaca
and reunites with his faithful wife.

00:03:56.565 --> 00:03:59.781
In contrast, Joyce's Bloom
wanders around Dublin for a day

00:03:59.781 --> 00:04:04.616
and returns home to his unfaithful wife.

00:04:04.616 --> 00:04:06.256
It's a very funny book.

00:04:06.256 --> 00:04:08.017
It has highbrow intellectual humor,

00:04:08.017 --> 00:04:10.898
if you have the patience to track down
Joyce's references,

00:04:10.898 --> 00:04:14.245
and more lowbrow dirty jokes.

00:04:14.245 --> 00:04:17.937
Those, and other sexual references,
were too much for some.

00:04:17.937 --> 00:04:21.487
In the U.S., the book was put on trial,
banned, and censored

00:04:21.487 --> 00:04:23.806
before it had even been completed

00:04:23.806 --> 00:04:27.857
because it was originally published
as a serial novel.

00:04:27.857 --> 00:04:31.487
Readers of "Ulysses" aren't just led
through a variety of literary styles.

00:04:31.487 --> 00:04:34.600
They're also given a rich 
and shockingly accurate tour

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.338
of a specific place at a time:

00:04:37.338 --> 00:04:39.938
Dublin in 1904.

00:04:39.938 --> 00:04:42.378
Joyce claimed that if Dublin
were to be destroyed,

00:04:42.378 --> 00:04:45.673
it could be recreated from the pages
of this book.

00:04:45.673 --> 00:04:47.806
While such a claim is not exactly true,

00:04:47.806 --> 00:04:52.011
it does show the great care that Joyce
took in precisely representing details,

00:04:52.011 --> 00:04:55.809
both large and small, of his home city.

00:04:55.809 --> 00:04:58.308
No small feat considering he wrote
the entire novel

00:04:58.308 --> 00:05:01.838
while living outside 
of his native Ireland.

00:05:01.838 --> 00:05:07.328
It's a testament to Joyce's genius
that "Ulysses" is a difficult book.

00:05:07.328 --> 00:05:10.918
Some people find it impenetrable
without a full book of annotations

00:05:10.918 --> 00:05:15.250
to help them understand what Joyce
is even talking about.

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:17.916
But there's a lot of joy to be found
in reading it,

00:05:17.916 --> 00:05:21.819
more than just unpacking allusions
and solving puzzles.

00:05:21.819 --> 00:05:25.649
And if it's difficult, 
or frustrating, or funny,

00:05:25.649 --> 00:05:29.131
that's because life is all that, and more.

00:05:29.131 --> 00:05:31.321
Responding to some criticism
of "Ulysses,"

00:05:31.321 --> 00:05:33.640
and there was a lot 
when it was first published,

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:36.452
Joyce said that if "Ulysses"
isn't worth reading,

00:05:36.452 --> 00:05:39.080
then life isn't worth living.
