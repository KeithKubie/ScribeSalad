00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:03.030
I want to clarify some
of the terminology I used

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:03.880
in the last video.

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:07.030
But before I do that, let's just
make sure that we understand

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:10.990
the mechanism of how
arteries can get blocked.

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:13.520
So in the last video, we talked
about these plaques forming.

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:18.140
And if this plaque is unstable,
at some point it could rupture.

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.410
And when it ruptures,
this material

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:22.890
can start to flow out
into the bloodstream.

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:27.024
And two things will happen.

00:00:27.024 --> 00:00:28.940
I just want to make it
a little bit more clear

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:30.690
relative to the last
video, especially now

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:33.360
that I can zoom in
on these arteries.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.360
Two things could happen.

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.620
Plaques-- or I should say
clotting, not plaques.

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.630
These are the plaques
that have been released.

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:47.380
The clotting factors can kind
of clot these released pieces

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:48.400
from the plaque.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.634
And the other thing
that can and often will

00:00:50.634 --> 00:00:52.550
happen-- and I didn't
talk about this in depth

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.610
in the last video--
is that you an also

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:56.380
have-- when this
thing ruptures, you

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:59.800
can also blood clots form here.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.530
Let me do this in a
more reddish color.

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.940
So you can also have blood clots
form on the ruptured plaque.

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.550
So everything, even
the plaque, the part

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:11.150
of the plaque that
has not begun to move,

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:12.390
can experience clotting.

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.290
And also the part
of the plaque that's

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.570
kind of been dumped into the
bloodstream can also clot.

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.780
In the last video, we saw
that one of these clots

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.590
can go downstream to some point
where the arteries get narrow

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:31.580
enough so that they
actually block the artery

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:34.370
right over here, and that
just restricts the blood flow.

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:35.880
So now all of a
sudden, you don't

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.870
have any blood flow
going downstream.

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:41.830
And all of this muscle
tissue that needs the blood

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.740
flow from this point, that
needs to get oxygen from that,

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:45.550
it might die.

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.470
And you might have a myocardial
infarction or a heart attack.

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.010
Now, what I want to clarify
is the actual terminology.

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.550
I guess, I was a little bit
hand-wavy with the terminology.

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:01.340
I want to get a little
bit deeper here.

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.670
This actual clot that forms that
can restrict the blood vessel,

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.067
this right here is a thrombus.

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.492
Thrombosis is the process
of a thrombus forming,

00:02:16.492 --> 00:02:17.950
so thrombosis are
these blood clots

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.030
that form that can
actually help to kind

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.680
of obstruct a blood vessel.

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.830
So this thrombus
right here is actually

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.660
going to make it
harder for the blood

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:32.410
to flow through this vessel.

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.440
Now, any of these
released pieces or chunks

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:36.970
in any of these
blood vessels that

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.120
can float around and
eventually lodge themselves

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.490
in and eventually
block the blood flow,

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:44.230
these are called emboli.

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.620
Or if I just use them in
the singular, one of these

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.640
is an embolus.

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.010
And I want to be clear.

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.020
An embolus is the
general term for anything

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:56.880
that can float
around in your blood

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.750
and eventually lodge
itself, at some point,

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.260
in your circulatory system
and restrict the blood flow.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.590
What we drew in the last
video-- and in particular,

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.340
this one as well-- is that
these emboli that are also

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.470
clotted-- so they're also
kind of thrombus-- they're are

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.219
thrombi and emboli
at the same time.

00:03:17.219 --> 00:03:19.260
This right here would be
called a thromboembolus.

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:31.970
These words are strange
to say sometimes.

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:34.140
So it wouldn't be wrong
to call it an embolus.

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.348
But in particular, when we
say it's a thromboembolus,

00:03:36.348 --> 00:03:38.380
you know that it's kind
of this clotted material

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.360
around this release plaque
that can go lodge itself.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.760
And in the last video, I
called this a thrombosis.

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.600
But that was really
not quite right.

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.870
The thrombosis is
really the formation

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.420
of the clot that can
restrict the blood flow.

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.641
When it actually
lodges itself further,

00:03:52.641 --> 00:03:54.640
when it actually breaks
off, becomes an embolus,

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:58.395
and lodges itself further
often restricts blood flow,

00:03:58.395 --> 00:03:59.770
this is called a
thromboembolism.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.820
Let me write this.

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:10.920
So hopefully I'm not
confusing you too much.

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.830
These medical terms
confuse me a lot,

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:14.205
but I want to make
it very clear.

00:04:14.205 --> 00:04:16.260
Thrombosis is just
the general formation

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.800
of a blood clot inside
of a blood vessel

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:20.529
that can restrict
the flow of blood.

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:24.240
So this right here, this
is thrombosis occurring.

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.050
That is thrombosis.

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.750
Once things break off and
they start floating around,

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:32.000
they're an embolus.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.510
That's the general term for it.

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:35.660
And in particular,
if it's broken off

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:39.300
material that is due to a
clot, it's a thromboembolus.

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.900
So thromboemboluses
are a more specific way

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:43.790
of calling it an embolus.

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:47.600
And once one of these things
lodge themselves and block

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:51.622
the blood flow, that's
a thromboembolism.

00:04:51.622 --> 00:04:53.080
You can also call
that an embolism.

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.060
Just when you say it's
a thromboembolism,

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:56.643
it makes it a little
bit more specific

00:04:56.643 --> 00:04:58.900
to know that it's kind
of clotted material.

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.160
So hopefully that
clarifies things

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.920
and doesn't confuse
you too much.
