00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:01.390
Before we finish the lesson,

00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:04.240
you should know that there are many
Android samples that show off how to use

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:06.870
the notification features
we've just discussed.

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.880
Let's go to File &gt; Import Sample,
and bring up the selector.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:12.560
The first is Basic Notifications.

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.500
This is the sample we
first stepped through.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.670
This performs generic notifications for
Android only, and

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:22.530
is a good starting point for testing out
the addition of wearable extensions.

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:24.240
The next is Wearable Notifications.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.895
This sample allows you to generate
every possible notification type for

00:00:27.895 --> 00:00:30.200
Android Wear and
see what they look like.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.490
This allows you to prototype
everything before you write the code.

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:36.390
Finally, there is Eliza Chat,
which allows you to have a conversation

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.730
using speech recognition with
an artificially intelligent robot,

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.600
using your Android Wear
device via notifications.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.460
So give this sample a try to find out
what is possible with Android Wear

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:46.320
notifications.
