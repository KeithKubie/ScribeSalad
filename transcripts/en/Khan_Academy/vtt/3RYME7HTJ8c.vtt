00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.700
We're asked, what's the
first wrong statement

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:07.600
in the proof below that
triangle BCE-- so that's

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.560
this middle triangle
right over here--

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:11.930
is congruent to triangle BCA?

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:14.230
That's this top triangle
right over there.

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:18.050
And they tell us that
BC is parallel to DF

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.101
and that the diagram
is not drawn to scale.

00:00:20.101 --> 00:00:20.600
Fair enough.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.209
So we're essentially
going to check their proof

00:00:23.209 --> 00:00:25.000
to see if it's either
correct or if there's

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.950
a wrong statement in it.

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:28.960
So let's look at the givens.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.985
They tell us that angle BAC
is congruent to angle BED.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.852
AC is congruent to DE.

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.220
ACB congruent to BDE.

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.050
So this is BDE.

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.110
This is ACB.

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.390
BC is congruent to CF.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.820
Just double-click there
to get the two slashes.

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.140
Angle ABC is congruent
to angle CFE.

00:01:02.158 --> 00:01:03.970
So that's this one.

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.444
Triple-click there
to get three of those

00:01:06.444 --> 00:01:08.360
to show that that's not
necessarily congruent,

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:09.450
or we don't know whether
they're congruent

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:10.517
to these other angles.

00:01:10.517 --> 00:01:11.350
So that's those two.

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.250
And then angle BAC, which
we've already marked,

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:17.530
is congruent to CEF.

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.400
So this angle is
congruent to this one.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.600
So this one will
be just one slash.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.300
So now let's go
through their proof

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.250
and see if it
makes actual sense.

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.790
So this first
statement they make

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:34.475
is, BDE is congruent to BCA
because of angle side angle.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.050
Let's see.

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.600
It looks like that's
right because you

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.400
have your double arc angle,
then your single side, and then

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.650
your single arc angle.

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.530
So you have angle, side, angle.

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:53.340
It is legitimate.

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.294
This is a legitimate
statement here.

00:01:55.294 --> 00:01:56.210
So I'm cool with that.

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.070
That's not going
to be incorrect.

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:04.860
Then they say angle
ACB is congruent to DBE

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.556
because vertical
angles are equal.

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:14.400
Well, this makes
absolutely no sense.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.180
Those aren't vertical angles.

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.560
Those just aren't
vertical angles.

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.476
Actually, the way that
this is drawn here,

00:02:25.476 --> 00:02:26.850
there aren't any
vertical angles.

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.682
But ACB and DBE are definitely
not vertical angles.

00:02:30.682 --> 00:02:31.640
So we're actually done.

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.510
We have found the
incorrect statement.

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:34.670
This is not true.

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.540
ACB is not congruent to DBE
because of vertical angles.

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.210
So the wrong statement
in this proof

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:41.626
was the statement
that tries to do

00:02:41.626 --> 00:02:44.020
that because of vertical angles.

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:45.650
So let's check our answer.

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.402
And it is correct.
