Hello, I'm the Nostalgia Critic.

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:04.380
I remember it so you don't have to.

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.380
Say, have you ever wanted to see Carey Elwes,

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:08.300
Gary Oldman,

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:09.180
Urkel,

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:10.180
Gabriel Byrne,

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:11.160

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.800
Balki from Perfect Strangers,

Jane Seymour,

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.480

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:16.320
Don Rickles,

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.680
and Eric Idle in a movie together?

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.700
No, nobody wants to see that!

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:21.520
But they did it!

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.860
In this fucking piece of shit called Quest for Camelot.

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:32.740
Back in the mid nineties when animation studios were trying to take down Disney

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.540
by...doing exactly what they did,

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.720
Warner Brothers gave us Quest for Camelot.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:42.960
This cheap, uninventive knockoff of the Disney style is so bland and so inpassionate

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.840
that you'd swear the steel they're fighting with would make much better characters.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.160
And actually, some of them do.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.560
But I'm getting ahead of myself.

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:54.600
Let's take a look at this medieval blast from the ass and see why it should've stayed in the Dark Ages.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.020
So we start off in Pride Schlock as we see our main hero, who's a girl named Kayley.

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.260
Awwwww.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.360
She's the daughter of one of the knights of the round table, played by Gabriel Byrne.

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.000
What's the knight's name?

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.200
Well, it doesn't really matter, they're having fun in this opening, which obviously means he's a goner.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.260
Kayley: I'm coming with you, daddy!

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.880
Father: Yes, when you're old enough, Kayley.

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.500
Kayley: One day, I'll be a knight. Like father.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.080
Well, you better work on growing that penis, honey.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.660
It's the Dark Ages, it sucks for everybody.

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:29.240
So the father joins the other knights as they venture towards their destination.

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:30.900
They ride to...

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.820

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.620
Now, I don't wanna give anything away here, but one of these guys is going to be the villain.

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:20.860
Can you guess who?

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.940
Wow, you're...you're a dumbass.

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.340
Actually, it's this guy, and his name is Ruber.

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.440
And wouldn't you know it, he's played by Gary Oldman,

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:34.620
who played ANOTHER obvious bad guy that everybody trusted as Dr. Smith in Lost in Space.

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.700
Which, oddly enough, came out the exact same year this movie did.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.240
C'mon, Gary Oldman, you're a great actor. Why were you choosing these obvious villain roles at the time?

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.260
I mean, there's just nothing subtle about them.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.000
[boom]

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.600
Dr. Smith: Did somebody question my subtle acting?!

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.080
NC: Oh cm'on, Dr. Smith, you're about as subtle as a fucking train wreck.

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:55.800
NC: On a boat.

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.620
Dr. Smith: Oh, come now, there are several differences between me and that Ruber fellow.

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.480
Dr. Smith: For example, I want to seize power and control through a legion of spiders!

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.360
NC: But...that Ruber guy wants to seize power and control too.

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.980
Dr. Smith: But not with spiders!

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.540
NC: Oh, for God's sake - you know what you need to do, Dr. Smith?

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:12.900
Dr. Smith: Does it involve spiders?

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.940
NC: No! You need to be diabolical.

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:20.280
NC: Actually fool people into thinking you're a kind, gentle, caring person. You think you can do that?

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.660
Dr. Smith: Think the boat's sort of sailed on that one.

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.000
NC: Alright, well, don't bother me anymore, I've got a review to do.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.160
Dr. Smith: Wait! There's one more important thing! It's imperative that you must know!

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.100
NC: What, what!?

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:33.660

Okay, from what I can gather, I guess,

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:52.940
Ruber has a magic juice that can combine living things with inanimate objects,

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:56.340
so he uses it to meld his followers into half-men, half-weaponry.

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:59.160
But...what's the story behind it?

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:01.360
I heard something about some witches he bought it from.

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:06.420
What, witches are working at the Acme Corporation? The Acme Corporation supports the black arts?

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:09.600
How does this work? You wanna elaborate a little bit?

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:12.260
Explain, movie! Explain!

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:18.740
Anyway, while that's going on, Kayley escapes in probably the most improbable way possible.

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:20.760
The guard just lets her go.

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:22.880

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:28.800
Now we've gotcha! We're never gonna let you go and-

But unfortunately, he informs him that he lost Excalibur.

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:06.120
and a chicken who's a fucking axe!

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:09.840
Are those really the images that come to your mind when you hear this song?

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:11.980
If so, then you are FUCKED!

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:15.360
I mean this song simply doesn't go in an action scene!

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:20.060
How would you like it if in Sin City, they started playing this song over the really intense moments?

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:24.380
♪ lead us to a place ♪

00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:28.680

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:41.460
So she enters the forbidden forest where the henchmen are not far behind.

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:46.440
"I'm still going to be the world's greatest knight!"

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:49.640
"That's why I'm running away from danger that's closing in behind me!"

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:52.320
"But I'm doing it very bravely."

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:55.580
But she's saved by a hermit named Garrett, played by Carey Elwes,

00:09:55.580 --> 00:10:00.320
a blind man who, quite frankly, makes Daredevil's moves look like a five year old gymnast.

00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:09.480
So Kayley tells Garrett about the stolen sword as they rush to retrieve it.

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:11.500
Garrett: Right. We're going after it.

00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:12.920
Kayley: Great!

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:16.780
Garrett: Not you. Me and Aiden. We work alone.

00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:22.040
Yes, in medieval times, even a blind man has more credibility to go into danger than a woman does.

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:23.640
It pays to have balls.

00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:26.360

Garrett: Alright, alright.

00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:30.980
But you just sung a friggin' song about why she can't come with you, and then all of a sudden she can?

00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:32.400

00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:38.400
[ding]

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:42.580
But the comedic axe chicken (God, I can't believe I just put those words together)

00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:44.900
tells Ruber about Kayley's escape.

00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:46.760
Ruber: You! Report!

00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:51.860
"Well, the plot makes no sense, we have no originality, and the songs are gonna be more successful than the actual movie."

00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:54.560
Ruber: You wretched mythological moron!

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:56.400
Chicken: Who knows where Excalibur is?

00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:59.660
Oh, by the way, did I mention that the chicken is played by Jaleel White?

00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:02.280
Doesn't that make him just so much more likable?

00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:05.520
(Sonic the Hedgehog voice) But if someone tries to touch you in a place or in a way that makes you feel

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:08.160
uncomfortable, that's no good.

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:11.960
So just when you think the beaker of annoyance can't possibly be filled any more,

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:14.240
guess what else they toss our way?

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:16.080
A double dragon.

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:17.360
God, I wish.

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:22.240
No, this is a funny two-headed dragon voiced by Eric Idle and Don Rickles.

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:23.620

00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:26.540

Short dragon: The waitresses, the actresses...

00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:34.140

So...what, we're just gonna move forward like nothing happened?

00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:22.520
Those two dragons just sung a three-minute song and you're not even going to acknowledge it?

00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:26.820
These songs have no purpose! They're like drive-by musicals!

Short dragon: How 'bout holding your breath?

00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:36.680
So Rhubarb - oh, I'm sorry, Ruber -

00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:39.080

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:40.200
Ruber: Get them!

So after the healing touch of...leaves,

00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:40.440
they make it to the cave where Excalibur is.

00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:43.660
And it turns out it's being held by...

00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:44.600
a rockbiter.

00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:45.820
Goblin: A rockbiter?!

00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:49.160
A rockbiter. For God's sake, you're not even trying.

00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:53.340
First you rip off Belle, and now you gotta rip off the rockbiter from Neverending Story.

00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:55.720
This is just painful!

00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:57.760
Rockbiter, what were you thinking?

00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:04.620
Rockbiter: It looked like a good, strong script, didn't it?

00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:08.900
The bad guys enter as well, but luckily our heroes get Excalibur before they can touch it.

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:16.260
Ruber: The ogre's butt.

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:19.440
Did he just say "the ogre's butt?"

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:21.700
Ruber: The ogre's butt.

00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:25.860
Okay, that's not a sentence, that's a noun. That's not even a good noun.

00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:30.660
In fact, this is where Gary Oldman should have known this movie was going to suck.

00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:34.300
When he had to just say the line "the ogre's butt."

00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:36.480
Gary: Gentlemen, I wanted to talk to you about this line.

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:37.260
Man: Which is that?

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:38.700
Gary: "The ogre's butt."

00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:39.540
Man: What about it?

00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:43.140
Gary: Is...is that it? Simply "the ogre's butt?"

00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:46.020
Man: Yeah, it's an ogre's butt. What's wrong with an ogre's butt?

00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:49.740
Gary: Oh, nothing, I have nothing against the ogre's butt, I'm sure the ogre's butt is lovely.

00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:53.900
Gary: However, there doesn't seem to be any reason for the ogre's butt.

00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:57.740
Gary: How about perhaps a, uh, verb, or predicate clause?

00:15:57.740 --> 00:15:59.980
Gary: Like, "Look out for the ogre's butt."

00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:02.860
Gary: Or, "Oh no, we are under the ogre's butt."

00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:10.020
Gary: Or, if you'll permit me, "Woe is me and all others who are trapped under ogre's butt...eseses."

00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:11.440
Man: Yeah, ogre's butt isn't plural.

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:14.380
Gary: Duly noted, but at least that one came with a conjunction.

00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:17.840
Gary: Grammatically speaking, I think that makes the ogre's butt much more palatable.

00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:19.260
Man: Look, just stick to the script.

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:23.900
Gary: But I ask you, how does it make any sense? I'm a Shakespearean trained actor.

00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:26.340
Man: Hey, weren't you that spider in Lost in Space?

00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:28.420
Gary: Ogre's butt it is.

00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:29.440
Man: Get to work, puppet.

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:30.520
Gary: [sigh]

00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:33.300
So our heroes get out and finally make it home.

00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:35.720
Kayley: Camelot.

00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:36.640
Patsy: It's only a model.

00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:37.520
King Arthur: Shh.

00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:39.160
Kayley: Oh, Garrett!

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:42.200
But just as they're about to hand in the sword together...

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:48.380
Garrett: You deliver it. I...I don't belong in that world.

00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:54.320
What do you mean you don't belong? You're incredible! You see better than how most people can see!

00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:56.260
In fact, are you even blind?

00:16:57.220 --> 00:16:58.320
Garrett: Come on, Aiden.

00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:03.580
Garrett: ♪ like every tree- ♪

00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:05.740
No. This makes no sense.

00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:09.760
You don't belong in a world with cozy houses, comfy beds, and guaranteed security,

00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:14.160
but you do belong in a world of killer plants, giant monsters, and dragons that can fucking eat you.

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:18.980
Hello, you're not hard of hearing! Just listen to a good opportunity and take advantage of it!

00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:21.740
You...moron!

00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:25.800
Well, of course, the bad guys catch up with Kayley and steal the sword away from her.

00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:29.820
Ruber takes the potion out of his cleavage and forges Excalibur onto his arm.

00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:34.580
Thus Kayley is kidnapped and used as leverage for her mother to get the villains into Camelot.

00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:38.640
Oh, and in answer to your question earlier, honey, about what a damsel in distress is,

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:43.200
it's a stupid female who knows how to take care of herself but yet constantly has to be rescued.

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:45.020
In other words: YOU!

00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:46.620
Ruber: Not a word.

00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:49.580
Guard: It's Lady Julianna! Lower the bridge at once!

00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:54.860
"Also let in the dark shadowy figure with the black hood, black horse and black saddle."

00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:57.260
"I'm sure he can be totally trusted."

00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:03.620
"I'm still the world's greatest knight!"

00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:09.540
Chicken: Ah! Bladebeak at your service!

00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:15.640
What?! Wait a minute! When did the chicken turn into a good guy?

00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:21.400
There was no transformation scene, he didn't talk to anyone, there wasn't even a line of dialogue!

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:25.900
Aren't you gonna fill us in, movie? Aren't you gonna let us know what's going on?

00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:27.520
JUST...

00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:29.020
EX...

00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:32.620
PLAAAAAIIN!!

00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:43.360
[explosions, screaming]

00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:46.940
Whew, oh...

00:18:54.820 --> 00:18:56.860
Sorry.

00:18:56.860 --> 00:19:01.080
So Kayley escapes, Ruber attacks, and Garrett changes his mind and comes back to help.

00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:10.720
Bladebeak: You've got to ask yourself, "Do I feel clucky?" Well? Do ya, punk?

00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:15.720
Sorry, I'm goin' for two!

00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:19.920
[explosion]

00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:21.640
That's it, I'm wrapping it up!

00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:26.240
They corner Ruber at the stone that Excalibur was pulled out of and trick him into slipping it back in.

00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:32.300
This causes some magical bullshit that blows him up and, get this, magically heals everybody.

00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:36.440
Why? How? I refer you to my first nuclear explosion.

00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:40.620
That's right, everyone is totally and permanently healed...

00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:42.260
except for the blind guy.

00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:45.840
Hey, what the hell?! Give the fucker his eyes, you bastards!

00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:51.100
What, was saving everything that could possibly be saved in this movie just not enough for you?

00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:53.240
Excalibur's a bunghole!

00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:56.800
So Kayley and Garrett are finally made knights, all the people rejoice,

00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:58.800
and celebrate by inventing river dance.

00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:03.040
Merlin: Well done, Aiden.

00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:07.220
"Heh heh, I did absolutely nothing. I was a complete waste of animation."

00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:22.420
King Arthur: On second thought, let's not go to Camelot. It is a silly place.

00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:24.800
Yeah, I think Arthur summed it up there.

00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:29.600
Quest for Camelot. A Medieval Times restaurant has more dignity than this piece of shit.

00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:34.720
The characters are ripoffs, the story has no connection to the Arthur legend, and, oh yeah,

00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:38.480
there's a bajillion things that are never explained.

00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:41.280
In fact, I want an answer! I want an answer right now!

00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:46.660
And not only do I want an answer, I want it answered as the most innocent, perfect being that I can think of:

00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:47.600
Mary Poppins.

00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:52.000
That's right, Mary Poppins is gonna be my representation of this movie.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.840
So tell me, Mary Poppins, how do you explain this bullshit that we just witnessed?

00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:58.800
Mary Poppins: First of all, I would like to make one thing quite clear.

00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:00.300
Uh huh.

00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:02.000
Mary Poppins: I never explain anything.

00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:03.880
FUCK YOU BITCH!

00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:04.820
[gunshot]

00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:07.860
Oh my god! Oh my god, I just killed Mary Poppins!

00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:13.800
I just killed my first childhood icon! Good lord, that's what this movie has done to me!

00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:16.700
Oh, Mary Poppins, I'm so sorry!

00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:18.020
Bert: Mary Poppins!

00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:19.540
[gunshot]

00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:23.340
BERT! Oh no, I killed Bert too!

00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:27.180
Okay, I gotta get out of here before I start killing any more innocent Disney characters!

00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:30.380
I'm the Nostalgia Critic, I remember it so you don't have to!

00:21:30.380 --> 00:21:31.840
Mickey Mouse: Haha! Hi, Mr. Nostalgia Critic!

00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:32.860
[gunshot]

00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:39.540
NC: Mickey! Oh no! I'm sorry, Quest for Camelot made me do it!

00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:41.120
Mickey: I...I understand.

00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:42.580
NC: Noooo!

00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:50.040
The ogre's butt.
