00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.560
Hi, I'm AndrÃ© Meadows and this is Crash Course Games.

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:05.360
So we finished the last episode nearing the end of the 1980s,

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:09.080
and Nintendo was dominating the US and Japanese home console markets.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:13.760
But, with the video game business being a capitalistic enterprise and all, competition was on the rise.

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:16.560
The 90s was the third decade of modern video games,

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.780
and, like the First Console War between Atari, Mattel, and Coleco, competition drove innovation and better games.

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:25.940
These new competitors were filling the hole left from the crash of the 80s,

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:28.840
but also targeting an older and more mature audience.

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.400
In the 1990s, players started seeing first person shooters, fighting games,

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.580
and lots and lots of sports games.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.860
And today we are going to focus on the entrance of one company in particular

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.820
that prompted this innovation and the war that came with it.

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.380
Sega!

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:51.560
[Theme Music]

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:57.940
So the Sega Corporation of Japan had entered the North American home console market in 1986 with its Sega Master System

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.340
which desperately wanted to compete with the NES but never managed to capture much market share.

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.660
But before we get ahead of ourselves, I want to take a second here to talk about Sega.

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:10.760
Sega sounds like a quintessential Japanese company but, actually, it was founded in the United States.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:11.700
By Americans.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.020
The company moved to Tokyo after World War 2 in focus on operating slot machines

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.580
and coin-operated games on US military bases.

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:23.540
At that time, the company was called Service Games, which would eventually be shortened and combined to form Sega.

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:29.100
Sega transitioned into video games in the 1970s, and survived the whole boom and bust that we already talked about.

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.600
And by the time Sega released its Master System, the company had been acquired by a Japanese conglomerate.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.940
OK, back to the Master System.

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:40.380
The Sega Master System failed to really compete with the NES in the United States, even though the hardware was technically superior.

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.580
This was mostly attributed to Sega's poor marketing,

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.140
but also because of Nintendo's licencing practices (which we talked about last episode)

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.420
which limited the number of third-party developers that Sega could work with.

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.940
But then, in 1989, Sega released its Genesis console, which was much more competitive.

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.720
To paraphrase Yoda, "Big gun, the second console wars had."

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.020
Let's go to the Thought Bubble.

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.960
Sega's first shots in the console wars were from the marketing department.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:08.360
Sega ran commercials that touted their superiority with the tagline "Genesis does what Nintendon't!"

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.500
Their main weapon, though, was the technology.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.460
Their position as the only next generation console on the market was a strong advantage

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.640
and they kept using that term "blast processing".

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.600
The superior Genesis hardware had moved from an 8-bit to 16-bit architecture.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.920
This made for improvements in the look, sound, and playability of Sega's games.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.000
This improved hardware allowed a home console to more closely match the quality of games in arcades.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.140
Sega also took a cue from Nintendo and created a flagship character that could be the face of the console like Mario was for Nintendo.

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.340
Sega's answer to the dumpy plumber who could sometimes throw fireballs was Sonic the Hedgehog.

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.880
But Sonic wasn't Sega's first attempt at a mascot.

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.340
During the Master System era, Alex Kid had been Sega's flagship character.

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.500
Unfortunately, he was a bland character on a system that hardly anyone owned

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.820
so no-one even cared enough about Alex Kid to hate him.

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:56.140
Sonic was designed to fix that problem and become the hedgehog that Sega could really sink its corporate identity teeth into.

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.860
Sonic, he could really move! Sonic, he's got attitude! Sonic, he's the fastest thing alive!

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.100
Sonic was meant to appeal to an older crowd than Mario and the NES and it kind of worked.

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.460
The Genesis also differentiated itself with the quality of its sports games.

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:13.380
They partnered with American athletes to make games like Joe Montana Football and Mario Lemieux Hockey

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.960
and licenced real teams and their players into these games.

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:19.640
Sega succeeded. It differentiated itself from Nintendo and was growing in market share.

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:24.700
But then, in 1991, Nintendo introduced its own 16-bit console in North America --

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.040
the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, or Super NES. Thanks, Thought Bubble!

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.440
So the Super NES launched with the universally acclaimed Super Mario World

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.880
and the technologically impressive racing game F Zero.

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.720
But the Genesis software library had a two-year headstart.

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.060
Many games for the Genesis were already on the market

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.480
and the Genesis continued to lead during the Super Nintendo's first year.

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.480
But Nintendo fell back on their tried-and-true strategy of producing high-quality games.

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.380
The company created hit after massive hit for the new console.

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:55.260
Nintendo games like Super Mario Kart, Starfox, and The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past all sold millions of copies.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:00.420
Third-party developers also delivered hits like Chrono Trigger, Mega Man X, the Final Fantasy series

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.120
and the import of the immensely popular arcade hit Street Fighter 2.

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.420
We'll talk more about that later.

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:09.840
And Nintendo also introduced another successful console around this time -- the Game Boy

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.000
which would go on to be one of the most successful handhelds of all time.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.800
Even though the Game Boy was handheld, it had similar capabilities to an 8-bit console.

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:19.040
It only displayed four shades of grey, though.

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.720
Some people even said it was green.

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.880
And it required a ton of AA batteries.

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.900
But it was portable, and it was bundled with the hit game Tetris.

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:30.820
When the Game Boy released in Japan, it sold out of its initial 300,000 run in two weeks.

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:35.940
This early success in handheld gaming would lead Nintendo to dominate this sector of the gaming industry for decades.

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:39.940
The Second Console War was long and difficult, but there were some upsides.

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:41.200
#1: Nobody died.

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:44.780
#2: All of this was pretty great for people who liked to play video games.

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:47.680
The Console War was capitalism at its best.

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.900
Competition drove rapid innovation and improvements in video game hardware and software.

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.700
But the Console War wasn't the only fight going on in the early 90s.

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:58.180
There was also the bitterly fought battle between M. Bison and Ryu.

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.460
Fighting games were huge at this time

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:04.780
and Street Fighter 2, which was released in arcades in 1991, revolutionised the format.

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.400
Now, fighting games had been around since the early days of video games

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.760
but the genre was mostly made up of platforming beat-em-up titles like Double Dragon.

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:14.520
The original Street Fighter pitted players against each other in head-to-head combat.

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.660
It had a moderate success in Japan and America.

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:19.060
Street fighter 2, though? That was a game changer.

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:21.760
There were character backstories, you got to know all their blood types.

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:24.500
Hey, you may want to donate blood to Guile one day. You don't know.

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:27.260
But the real star of the show was the gameplay.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.900
The new 16-bit technology and its advanced controls were hyperresponsive

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:34.060
and gave players the ability to execute a huge number of moves.

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.060
Street Fighter 2 invented the combo mechanic

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:40.720
and created the deep human pleasure of a well-timed Shoryuken or a Haryuken

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:44.920
or whatever that thing that E. Honda does when he just does this.

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:47.180
But nothing breeds competition like success

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:52.540
so in 1992, Midway released Mortal Kombat to compete with Street Fighter 2.

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:58.160
Its deeply compelling characters, visual style and carnage made it a popular alternative to the Street Fighter series.

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.380
Mortal Kombat used digitised photographs as models for the characters.

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:04.900
It was supposed to make the fighters look more real  than characters in Street Fighter.

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:09.300
Mortal Kombat also aimed for the adult market by including a lot of blood and gore.

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:10.480
And I mean a LOT.

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:15.120
You might not have known Johnny Cage's blood type, but in Mortal Kombat he could punch a dude's head off

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.580
and then put on his sunglasses and look super cool.

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:21.400
Hey, it could be worse. You could go up against Sub Zero and he could pull your spine out.

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:22.480
Fatality.

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:23.500
Excellent.

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:26.120
Let's play some Mortal Kombat!

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:27.180
Level up!

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:30.900
So when the game came out on Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis, it was interesting

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:34.160
because on the Super Nintendo version, they didn't have any blood at all.

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:39.180
They actually made the blood splats clear so it looked like sweat.

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:43.220
So you weren't supposed to think that they were bleeding, you were thinking that they were just sweating.

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:47.780
And the Genesis version, as we're seeing right now, is clean to start

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:53.980
but you could put in a special code and if you put in that special code, you got blood.

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:56.220
I think we're gonna do that right now.

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:57.540
OK, here you go.

00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:02.520
On this screen, you go A - B - A - C - A - B - B.

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:04.400
*gasp* Did you see it?

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.060
See it change color?

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:09.760
That means we got blood!

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:15.300
So all the game's graphic violence, the blood, the fatalities -- that's what led a lot of parents

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:18.960
and legislators to be upset specifically about Mortal Kombat.

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:23.260
It was games like this that led to the Electronic Software Ratings Board, or ESRB.

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:31.920
Ooh, see? That's wh-- see? That-- [laughs] That right there is why we now have ratings on our video games.

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:36.000
See? And that's why I could only play the Super Nintendo version of Mortal Kombat in my home

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.140
and why some of my friends got the Genesis version.

00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:40.800
And let's talk about the ESRB for a second.

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:44.500
The ESRB, much like the MPAA, is a self-regulating organisation

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:47.640
that assigns age and content ratings to computer and video games.

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:51.180
And, just like the MPAA, it has become the standard of the industry.

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:54.200
Now, we're not here to talk about if this is a good thing or a bad thing

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:58.040
but rather the fact that in 1994, it was even a thing.

00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:02.700
The ESRB's need for a rating scale showed that games were not only containing more mature content

00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:05.280
but that they were also gaining a much wider audience.

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:09.660
People who weren't playing video games even knew about video games and what were in them.

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:14.520
Like movies, comic books, and music before it, games were going mainstream, and people noticed.

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:18.600
Speaking of more mature games, Doom was released on the PC in 1993.

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:22.040
Once again, players and non-players reacted very differently.

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:25.840
The game's violence and "evil" imagery caused a media uproar.

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:31.760
For example, on CBS' Sixty Minutes, a former army colonel called the game "a mass murder simulator"

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:36.200
and tried to connect the game directly to the 1999 school shootings in Columbine, Colorado.

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:42.100
So Doom was controversial but no-one disputes that it was also hugely influential in the world of video game design.

00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:44.680
It was a major improvement on the first-person shooter

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:47.480
and its wide popularity brought a lot of gamers to the genre.

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:50.340
The game was praised for its level design and its overall gameplay

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:52.200
but it innovated in a number of important ways.

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:55.960
Doom was an early example of the use of 3D elements in video games.

00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:59.560
Sure, some people say the game wasn't purely 3D and had some 2D elements

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:03.720
but the experience of running through 3D rendered hallways was new and deeply appealing to players.

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:07.340
Doom was also one of the first games to successfully make use of network play.

00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:09.260
Players could compete over the internet.

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:12.700
The extremely popular online arena matches were called deathmatches,

00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:14.900
now a standard term in the online FPS world.

00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:17.680
The other big innovation in Doom was the modification system.

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:22.160
Players could edit or "mod" the levels that came with the game, or they could create levels from scratch.

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:25.940
This was a very popular feature and it shaped the video game industry for years to come.

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:29.780
Many game designers had their first taste of creating games while making levels for Doom.

00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:36.560
Wow, game modification, online play, fighting games, 16-bit consoles, portable systems, super fast hedgeheogs!

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:40.120
The 90s saw a number of huge leaps forward for the video game industry

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:42.760
and we've only talked about the first half of the decade!

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:48.220
Next week, we'll see the entry of a major new player to the console market, the adoption of CD-ROM technology

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:52.260
and the rapid evolution of 3D gaming that would play out on the next generation of consoles.

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:53.800
And there's another war.

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:54.960
Another Console War.

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:57.180
Thanks for watching. We'll see you next week.

00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:58.360
Say bye, Sonic!

00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:03.440
[sings]

00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:04.700
Sega!

00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:08.080
[laughs]

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:12.460
Crash Course Games is filmed in the Chad and Stacey Emigholz Studio in Indianapolis, Indiana

00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:14.320
and it's made with the help of all these nice people.

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:17.460
If you'd like to keep Crash Course free for everyone forever

00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:21.760
