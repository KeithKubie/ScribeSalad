00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.160
Vsauce!

00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:02.160
Kevin here.

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:07.490
A Century Egg is a Chinese preserved egg dish
that looks grey and smells like sulfur and

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:08.490
ammonia.

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.769
It’s cured anywhere from several weeks to
months in a mixture of ash, salt, clay, quicklime

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.410
and rice hulls and the ammonia smell is so
strong a myth developed that the eggs were

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:20.720
actually soaked in horse urine.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:21.939
Which they're not.

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:27.090
Over in Japan, Natto is soybeans fermented
with Bacilis Subtilis bacteria and it smells

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.890
like a combination of pungent cheese and old
socks.

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.440
The slippery, sticky dish actually has health
benefits as a result of containing Pyrazine,

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:40.050
the same compound giving it it’s distinct
smell, which is proven to reduce the likelihood

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.809
of blood clotting.

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:47.020
Taking a deep breath while eating South Korea’s
Hongeo has been likened to licking a urinal.

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:53.199
The uncooked, fermented skate has such a strong
odor because the fish has no bladder or kidneys

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:56.309
so uric acid oozes out of its skin.

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.539
When fermented for up to 15 days the uric
acid turns to ammonia and walking into a room

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:06.280
filled with fermenting skate can burn your
eyes and nose down to your lungs.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.110
To top it off it's chewy and hard to swallow.

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.190
Stinky Tofu is prepared differently all over
China and Taiwan and it’s been purported

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:15.580
to smell like an open sewer.

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:21.060
The malodorous fermented tofu is often sold
by open air street vendors rather than inside

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.820
restaurants and it's traditionally made with
a brine of fermented milk, vegetables and

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.220
meat that can take several months.

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.810
Its fans say the smellier it is - the better
it tastes.

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.890
When it comes to cheese Limburger, mostly
made in Germany, is notoriously foul-smelling

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.280
due to the bacterium used to ferment it, Brevibacterium
linens.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.740
Which is also found on human skin and partially
responsible for foot odor.

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.990
Durians, a fruit native to Southeast Asia
have a smell that’s been described as like

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.750
road kill wrapped in sweaty socks.

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.640
Shaped like a rugby ball covered in spikes,
it’s banned on mass transit, airplanes and

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.900
hotels due to its odor which can be detected
by animals from half a mile away.

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:07.140
And while some absolutely love the taste,
calling it the "King Of Fruits" - Chef Andrew

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.240
Zimmern compared it to completely rotten,
mushy onions.

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:16.420
Lutefisk is a gelatinous fish dish made in
some Nordic countries from aged stockfish

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.730
or dried whitefish and lye.

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:24.160
It’s often eaten during Christmas in Norway
despite being described as tasting like soap

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.820
and giving off an odor that would gag a goat.

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:32.250
But Northern Sweden boasts a soured herring
considered one of the most putrid smells in

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.250
the world.

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.890
Surströmming is fermented baltic herring
that comes in a can and features pungent smelling

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.950
acids like propionic acid, butyric acid and
acetic acid.

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:44.670
As well as hydrogen sulphide.

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.650
A German food critic once wrote that “the
biggest challenge when eating surströmming

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.160
is to vomit only after the first bite, as
opposed to before.”

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:57.090
It’s even stronger smelling than other fermented
seafood like Hákarl from Iceland - which

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.790
is rotten shark hung for five months because
the meat is actually poisonous when fresh.

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:07.340
Or Kusaya which is Japanese for “stinking
fish” - another fermented fish that is dried

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:12.910
in the sun after being soaked in a smelly
brine that can be over a hundred years old

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.870
and passed down from generation to generation
as a family heirloom.

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.840
Finally, Kiviak an Inuit food from Greenland
involves stuffing hundreds of birds inside

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:27.500
seal skin, sewing it up, sealing it with grease
and burying it under a huge flat stone to

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.930
keep air content to a minimum.

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:35.640
After seven months it’s dug up and the fermented
birds are eaten often at weddings or for birthdays.

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.680
So happy birthday!

00:03:37.680 --> 00:04:12.220
And as always - thanks for watching.
