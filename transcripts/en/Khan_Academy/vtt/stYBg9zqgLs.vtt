00:00:00.919 --> 00:00:02.718
- [Voiceover] Consider the
system of linear equations

00:00:02.718 --> 00:00:05.307
above, which of the
following choices of a,

00:00:05.307 --> 00:00:07.396
will result in a system of equations

00:00:07.396 --> 00:00:10.786
with no solutions?

00:00:10.786 --> 00:00:12.667
So a system has no solutions,

00:00:12.667 --> 00:00:14.466
is if both lines, and these are both

00:00:14.466 --> 00:00:15.582
linear equations, they actually tell us

00:00:15.582 --> 00:00:17.788
these are linear equations,

00:00:17.788 --> 00:00:20.481
is if you have two
lines that are parallel.

00:00:20.481 --> 00:00:22.524
Then, you have no solutions.

00:00:22.524 --> 00:00:24.299
They are never going to intersect,

00:00:24.299 --> 00:00:27.759
there's no x, y pair that
satisfies both of them.

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:31.915
So if they are parallel, then you're going

00:00:31.915 --> 00:00:34.121
to have no solutions.

00:00:34.121 --> 00:00:36.454
So what makes two lines parallel?

00:00:36.454 --> 00:00:38.719
Well, if they have the same slope,

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:42.291
but they have different y intercepts,

00:00:43.281 --> 00:00:45.765
you're going to be parallel.

00:00:45.765 --> 00:00:47.739
So essentially we need to pick the a here

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:51.119
that makes the second line
parallel to the first.

00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:52.849
And to do that, I'm
going to actually write

00:00:52.849 --> 00:00:56.599
both of them in kind of
the slope intercept form

00:00:56.599 --> 00:00:59.223
where y is equal to the slope times x

00:00:59.223 --> 00:01:01.567
plus the intercept.

00:01:01.567 --> 00:01:04.283
So let's do that, let's
do that for both of these.

00:01:04.283 --> 00:01:06.699
So first I'll do this one up here,

00:01:06.699 --> 00:01:10.506
so you have nine x minus 14 y is equal

00:01:10.506 --> 00:01:12.167
to negative three.

00:01:12.167 --> 00:01:14.534
See, if I subtract nine x from both sides,

00:01:14.534 --> 00:01:17.518
I would get negative 14 y is equal

00:01:17.518 --> 00:01:20.537
to negative nine x minus three.

00:01:20.537 --> 00:01:24.135
See, if I divide both
sides by negative 14,

00:01:24.135 --> 00:01:27.153
I'm going to get y is
equal to negative nine

00:01:27.153 --> 00:01:28.396
divided by negative 14

00:01:28.396 --> 00:01:32.286
is positive nine over 14 x,

00:01:32.286 --> 00:01:37.286
and then plus three over 14.

00:01:37.648 --> 00:01:41.468
So that's this line, written
in slope intercept form.

00:01:41.468 --> 00:01:42.802
Now let me write the second line

00:01:42.802 --> 00:01:45.287
in slope intercept form.

00:01:45.287 --> 00:01:50.287
So I have two x minus ay,
is equal to negative six.

00:01:50.742 --> 00:01:52.763
And let's see, if I subtract
two from both sides,

00:01:52.763 --> 00:01:57.763
I get negative ay is
equal to negative two x,

00:01:57.929 --> 00:01:59.647
I'm subtracting two x from both sides,

00:01:59.647 --> 00:02:02.909
minus two x, minus six,

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.463
and then I can divide
both sides by negative a,

00:02:05.463 --> 00:02:08.459
and I get y is equal to negative two

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.863
divided by negative a is positive two

00:02:10.863 --> 00:02:15.814
over ax, and then plus six

00:02:15.814 --> 00:02:19.605
over a.

00:02:19.773 --> 00:02:23.379
All right, so we need
to set up a situation

00:02:24.679 --> 00:02:29.395
where two over a is equal to nine over 14.

00:02:29.395 --> 00:02:31.704
These two things have
to have the same slope.

00:02:31.704 --> 00:02:33.331
And then when we're able
to figure out that a,

00:02:33.331 --> 00:02:34.943
we have to verify that
they have different y

00:02:34.943 --> 00:02:36.396
intercepts because if
they have the same slope

00:02:36.396 --> 00:02:37.779
and the same y intercept,

00:02:37.779 --> 00:02:38.771
instead of having no solutions,

00:02:38.771 --> 00:02:40.097
they would have an infinite number

00:02:40.097 --> 00:02:40.931
of solutions because then it would be

00:02:40.931 --> 00:02:42.266
the same line.

00:02:42.266 --> 00:02:43.449
But let's solve for a,

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:46.319
so we know that nine over 14,

00:02:49.779 --> 00:02:53.826
needs to be equal to two over a.

00:02:55.056 --> 00:02:58.597
Or another way of thinking about this,

00:02:58.937 --> 00:03:01.085
sometimes people say cross
multiply and all that,

00:03:01.085 --> 00:03:05.345
I like to just do logical
algebraic operations.

00:03:05.345 --> 00:03:07.969
But we can take the
reciprocal of both sides.

00:03:07.969 --> 00:03:09.327
So we could have,

00:03:09.327 --> 00:03:10.592
and actually, let me swap both sides,

00:03:10.592 --> 00:03:12.671
so we could say a over two

00:03:12.671 --> 00:03:15.746
is equal to 14 over nine.

00:03:18.116 --> 00:03:20.952
And then multiply both sides by two.

00:03:23.315 --> 00:03:28.315
And you're gonna get a
is equal to 28 over nine.

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:30.592
a is going to be this right over here,

00:03:30.592 --> 00:03:33.946
this is 28 over nine.

00:03:34.226 --> 00:03:35.536
So if I'm under time pressure,

00:03:35.536 --> 00:03:39.050
I already see a choice
that's looking pretty good.

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:41.983
If a is 28 over nine,

00:03:41.983 --> 00:03:43.255
these two things are going to have

00:03:43.255 --> 00:03:44.637
the same slope.

00:03:44.637 --> 00:03:45.425
But let's make sure they don't have

00:03:45.425 --> 00:03:47.352
the same y intercept,
and I wouldn't do this

00:03:47.352 --> 00:03:48.989
if I was under time pressure,

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:50.917
but just for it to feel good about it,

00:03:50.917 --> 00:03:53.435
if this y intercept is six over a,

00:03:53.435 --> 00:03:57.805
so it's going to be six over 28 over nine,

00:04:00.725 --> 00:04:01.882
dividing by a fraction is the same thing

00:04:01.882 --> 00:04:03.414
as multiplying by its reciprocal,

00:04:03.414 --> 00:04:04.179
so it's going to be the same thing

00:04:04.179 --> 00:04:07.511
as six times nine over 28,

00:04:07.511 --> 00:04:10.820
and this is going to be
equal to six times nine

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:14.633
is 54 over 28,

00:04:14.633 --> 00:04:16.153
which is clearly different

00:04:16.153 --> 00:04:18.255
than three over 14.

00:04:18.255 --> 00:04:20.936
So if a is 28 over nine, same slope,

00:04:20.936 --> 00:04:22.456
different y intercepts,

00:04:22.456 --> 00:04:24.291
and you're dealing with parallel lines,

00:04:24.291 --> 00:04:25.638
they will not intersect

00:04:25.638 --> 00:04:28.721
and you're going to have no solutions.
