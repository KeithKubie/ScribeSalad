Speaker 1:          00:01          Okay. I'll go ahead and start. Just cause I'm, I'm not sure how many people will end up being here. So, um, as promised today, I will tell you a little bit about the exam and I'll show you some questions from a past year so that you can see what they're like. We rewrite the exam every year. Um, even makeup exams are all different. So, um, I have a lot of these in my files. Um, the exam is two and a half hours in a three hour, um, in a three hour slot. We have two rooms because we have a big class. They've given us this room and one o two. So you can come to either room, um, for the event. Uh, Friday, may nine, two to five. It has three parts. The first part is identifications. And that's small things from, uh, any of the novels. That could be a character.

Speaker 1:          00:57          It could be a place name, it could be a even a couple of words, a quotation. And you have to give the author and title that it comes from of the book that it comes from. And, um, tell us what it is and a couple of sentences about it's significant. So why that thing is important. Um, passages will be little chunks of text from a novel. Again, you'll have to know author and title, and then you will have to do an interpretation of the passage. And then you have to say in a couple of sentences how that passage as you've interpreted it is important to the book as a whole. Oh, and you have to say the context of the passage. Now, this might differ. I'll give you a couple of examples. This'll be different. It might be a matter of saying where in the plot it occurs or, uh, who, which characters speaking, um, what's going on in the scene from which it's, it's pulled, uh, some sort of relevant context so that we know that you understand where the thing comes from.

Speaker 1:          02:08          Um, so you have 15 minutes to do each of those. Um, the essay is 40% of the, of the final grade. You have a half an hour, and I'll show you, I have a special way of doing these essays. Usually they're big general questions. Um, a good way to review for that is to look at the old essay questions, the essay topics. You'll find a lot of clues there about themes that unite all the works on the syllabus. So that can be a good way of studying. In each of these sections you will get to choose. So in the ids usually give nine and you get to choose six in the passages I aim for seven and you choose for in the essays I always give three and you choose one. Within the essays you can choose to between two lists of books to use to answer your questions.

Speaker 1:          03:06          Um, you get to choose three, four on each of those two lists. And I'll explain a little bit why I do that when I show you one. The one restriction on the essay is that you may only write about one novel you've written a long paper on. So only one of the three novels that you choose to write about for the essay question can be one that you wrote about in a paper. So your TF who will be grading the exam will know what you wrote on. So just a observe that guideline. It's written in the directions of the exam. Um, now, so let me show you now what these look like.

Speaker 2:          03:47          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          04:02          um, first of all, I'm going to give you a couple ideas and, and we'll play a little game. Who can identify this? So see horses. Yes. No, I'm not going to call you Sarah. That's not fair. Only if they're all washed up. Can anyone except Sarah identify this? Okay. Sarah, go ahead.

Speaker 2:          04:30          How's grandfather your grandfather? She always wants to,

Speaker 1:          04:40          that's right. Okay. Did that seem hard judging by the Paucity of answers? It was, um, yes, that's exactly what you need to say. You need to say Maryland Ha Robinson housekeeping. And you'd have to explain that. Um, she always wanted to look at this little drawing that her husband made for her. Um, let me think of another one. The dancing bear.

Speaker 2:          05:06          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          05:07          More of, you know that. Yes. I one

Speaker 2:          05:11          is it girl?

Speaker 1:          05:17          Okay. Yes, very good. So you, that's the end of blood meridian. You would have to say that it's at the very end in order to get full credit for that Id. So you need to know that. Um, let me think of another Oh, lane as a name. Lean.

Speaker 2:          05:34          Yes,

Speaker 1:          05:39          yes, absolutely. And you might want to say what he represents. So what, what would he represent if you were gonna give us a sentence about what he represents. What would you say? Why he's important?

Speaker 2:          05:54          Kind of, uh, the editor, the like the education, our education system and the, um, I forget what the exact word they use, but the views that I'm Franny thinks that education like that I think is pointless. It doesn't lead to wisdom. And he is, um, expanding upon all these points for being basically just gets rough. This readings. Yes. He doesn't actually understand.

Speaker 1:          06:21          Yes, that's true. And he's pretentious. So he's much more interested in, in his, uh, possibilities for publication and how well he's done in his course than he is in the wisdom that Franny and Zooey both value. Okay. Yes. So you get the idea. Um, that's what an ideas. So now let me show you a passage and we'll do some of these. Now, the important thing about passages is that you talk about the language of the passage as well as just what's in it. So these will be chosen for the interest of their language and you will want to note the words and talk about why things are said the way they're set. Whoops, what do I need my mute. Okay, so here's one take a moment. Now is the time. And folks I just couldn't in silence, I turned Shorewood and gravely due to flee. She also turned and still health screen bits council and still I could not make myself drown. The poor, slippery, big bodied creature. What is this from

Speaker 2:          07:44          [inaudible]?

Speaker 1:          07:45          Yes. And what's, what is going on in the scene?

Speaker 2:          07:48          Humbert is contemplating joining Charlotte like hourglass.

Speaker 1:          07:52          Very good. Yes. Um, that's all the context you would need to identify this passage. Now take a minute and look, what do you think in the language of this passage would be useful to comment on? What do you notice about it? But the language? Yes. Using folks. Yes. He's addressing, absolutely. You would have to talk about that to get full credit for an answer on this one. Um, it's an address to the reader. You'd need to talk about why he says that. So what would your account be for why he says that?

Speaker 2:          08:29          Because he's making tea for his innocence and he's addressing people in informal manner to try and sort of reach them on a, on a friendship.

Speaker 1:          08:39          Exactly.

Speaker 2:          08:40          Yeah. And he just wants to do is create a picture of his own mortality.

Speaker 1:          08:43          Okay. Yes. Very good. That's a very nice way of putting it. When you say he's making a plea for his innocence, that, uh, is the whole context of the novel. That's what sets up the novel. That's the frame of novel. And so just by making that observation, you've done an important thing for the passage I notifications, which is that you have drawn its significance in the context of the larger novel, the whole novel. What else might warrant your notice here? What other bits of the language?

Speaker 2:          09:18          Yes. Big bodied creature.

Speaker 1:          09:21          Yes. What about that

Speaker 2:          09:24          opposition he sets up with John's body release his body and the body Pesto?

Speaker 1:          09:30          Absolutely. Yes. So that's, that would be perfect. Nice and economical. What else? What else do you see there

Speaker 2:          09:39          that you could comment on? Yes. The now is the time with the exclamation mark. Almost as like a hero.

Speaker 1:          09:52          Yes. Yeah. And what would you make of that in an answer?

Speaker 2:          09:56          We'll do it as much as he's trying to prove his innocence. He also, Yup. We're really thinks of actually getting the right thing.

Speaker 1:          10:04          Yes. Well we're laughing about it. You would probably want to note that it's a comic use of that literary convention and so you could say something about his deployment of conventional language, either for satirical use or for, for comedy or to play up the drama of his, um, self understanding. So that would be a nicer point. Somewhat more subtle observation. Um, that would set, uh, your exam, grading, TF, uh, into a state of happiness. Much to be desired. All right, let me see. Show you another one.

Speaker 2:          10:57          Okay. This one, take a minute and read it. Right.

Speaker 1:          11:34          Okay. What's this from?

Speaker 2:          11:36          Okay.

Speaker 1:          11:38          Known world. Okay. Sometimes we will take out character names. Ah, I've done this with at a pie in the past in crying flop 49 just because it's so, uh, so identified with that. It seems like too much of a dead giveaway. I don't do that very often here. Augustus is an easy identifier. Um, what would you want to say about this passage? What do you notice about it that seems worth accounting for?

Speaker 2:          12:19          Hmm, probably, um, with the phrase, I know what I know. I'm connected to the title of the known world. Yep. We can make a comment about how our world is defined by what we know and the perception of God's truth and how that fits in.

Speaker 1:          12:35          Absolutely. Yeah. And if you, if you could tie that notion of God's truth to the godlike omniscience of the narrator in the known world, that would be a great thing to do. And that would be way to tie your analysis of this passage to the concerns of the novel as a whole. So that would be good to do. What else do you notice that you could make use of thematically or formally? Here

Speaker 2:          13:15          you lie. It's like the barriers to achieving the morale, vision, morality, like, um, uh, uh, military and ready, kind of dream of treating slaves like, like, like his children and they end up acting all his lightsaber saying the same thing. There should be a light that light isn't

Speaker 1:          13:45          right. So both in the, in your example of Mildred and uh, uh, uh, Mildred and Henry, not Mildred, um, Henry and I'm

Speaker 1:          13:57          now I've lost her name. What is her name? His wife's name? Oh, no. Caledonia, um, Henry and Caledonia have this vision of a pure morality that they could sponsor in their slave holding life. And similarly, um, this is, um, Barnum, Kinsey speaking. You'd want to identify the speaker here, Barnum Kinsey, dreams of a pure space in which he could do the morally right thing. But as Eli was saying, this is a novel in which no such space or light as possible. So you'd want to note that, um, that's more of a thematic element of this, but you would want to note that that's really important. Anything else that we might want to say? Yes.

Speaker 2:          14:49          Oh Wow. In the language she repeats a body to say in a body should stand and it's kind of a way of preventing literary means of decoration or like I know where it,

Speaker 1:          15:03          yeah, I think you can definitely talk about that. I think there are a couple of ways. One is to associate it with literacy so that just being as a way of testifying somehow, um, that Barnum and behaving the way he would've wanted to behave, um, could have done the moral thing. But there's a contrast here between saying it being the moral thing and his having stood by as a body in that scene and allowed Augustus to be sold into slavery. Um, so you could certainly make hay of that elocution and for any um, example that uses dialect in this way, you do want to interrogate it. So don't just say, well that's, I'm just trying to sound like someone would sound like in this social situation, don't stop there. That know that the passages will be chosen so that any irregularity of language, even if it's for the purposes of realism in dialect, is probably going to be something you can talk about. So just be aware of that and creative in thinking about what that variation in language could mean. Okay. Let me show you another, okay. What's that from? Yes, yes. It's from on the road. And what would you want to say about it?

Speaker 2:          17:17          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          17:18          What's important to notice about the language and what's important in the thematic of it? In the content of it.

Speaker 2:          17:25          Yeah. Yes sir. We'll work on it. We could talk about like this unique sort of speech and how I'm threatening, which attempts to sort of like Regis on site cause some kind of truth by I'm getting at like intuitive understanding.

Speaker 1:          17:58          Yeah, absolutely. So words like that you'd need to talk about Dean's language and just as Sarah has done, put it in the context of our understanding of Dean's language and its evolution over the course of the novel. So that does the work of getting your interpretation into the context of an entire interpretation of the novel. Um, and there is that sense of immediacy. So making up words and attempt to get at a, at an, uh, an unusual proximity to experience. Okay. What else would you want to notice?

Speaker 2:          18:31          Okay,

Speaker 1:          18:45          well what's he talking about?

Speaker 2:          18:47          Okay. Yes, yes. Uh, [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          19:03          Okay. Yes. Specially in what, sorry.

Speaker 2:          19:08          Yeah. The last one we did.

Speaker 1:          19:12          Yeah, absolutely. The, the language and the way Dean's language falls apart over the course of the novel is one way that he's trying to get at a different kind of language. But music is the figure for the, for another way or it's another figure for that effort to get beyond the limitations of language. And here the way jazz is being described, its ability to capture some ineffable thing. It is what you'd want to highlight. So you want to connect that analysis of how jazz is being described here with the role of jazz in the novel as a whole, especially in the novels, uh, linguistic ambitions. It's literary ambitions. Um, you might want to notice the empty space that's, that's, um, highlighted here. It's another version of the vagueness of spirituality in a couple of our novels. On the syllabus. Um, but certainly in on the road, the vagueness of that thing that they are looking for.

Speaker 1:          20:18          Um, and also you could, you could talk about the communal dynamics of meaning making here and you could connect that with how it's important that Sao and dean operate in this larger set of people that sort of ebb and flow throughout the novel. This is not the individual artists sitting alone, but rather a dream of an American identity that is somehow built in a free thinking community of people or a free acting community of people. So you get that in all of a sudden somewhere in the middle of the course, he gets it, everybody looks up and knows there's a dream there of a shared meaning making moment that everyone will know it will be immediately compelling.

Speaker 2:          21:15          Okay.

Speaker 1:          21:17          Rehashes of old blowing it. He's talking about how jazz musicians are in conversation with the tradition. You could use that little piece and talk about the way that on the road is in conversation with other literary traditions. How it imagines itself as a revision of modernism. Uh, we had a wonderful paper that I think some of you saw as a sample about, um, uh, about the relationship between Hemingway and Kerouac in this novel. I didn't lecture on this, but if you, any of you saw that paper, that's a, that's an example of what you might want to say, uh, about the relationship between tradition and innovation, which is theater based here in jazz, but it's acted out in the novel as well. Okay. Do you get the idea of how these work? Okay, so this is, this is what I'm looking for in the passages now in the essays.

Speaker 2:          22:27          Okay.

Speaker 1:          22:31          Usually we have extremely broad questions, some of which are more theoretical than others. Some are more thematic, like we had one, I'll show you in a minute about work. It's looks quite different from this one. But, um, here's the question often said that many of the humanistic disciplines of the second half of the 20th century or march by their interest in language itself, in other words, language becomes not just a medium but a problem. To what extent are the problems of language foregrounded in the novels of this period? What are the consequences of this turn for the writing of fiction? How does such a foregrounding affect the traditional terms of the novel concerns of the novel, the creation of character, the relationship between style and content, problems of various militude, etc. Now you would have to choose one of those groups and then within one of those groups of novels you would need to choose three of the four to talk about.

Speaker 1:          23:28          So the essay will be bringing together three novels around one of these questions. The reason I grouped them this way is because some of the novels on the syllabus you could put together and have a very partial account of fiction in this period looks like. So say your novels were um, Barth pension and for all of them have very similar formal ambitions. Kay. I would not make it possible for you to do that. So I'm looking for you to be able to take texts that seem unlike in their concerns and in their formal elements and put them into conversation with each other around a particular question. Okay. Similarly, I would not ask you to do, um, woman warrior, bluest eye and known world. Um, I wouldn't ask you to do probably woman warrior Blewis die and human stain either.

Speaker 2:          24:37          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          24:37          It's all too much about identity.

Speaker 2:          24:40          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          24:41          In, in somewhat similar terms. So I wouldn't ask you those novels together so you can see that I mix them up. Don't forget black boy that will be on the exam. If you join the course in the middle of reading week, I mean not in the middle of shopping period. You might want to go back and fill that in to your reading. If you haven't read that. Um, let's see. Questions about, about the essay questions.

Speaker 2:          25:16          Okay.

Speaker 1:          25:16          I highly, highly recommend that you take the time to outline, um, if you're not used to taking essay exams or even if you are, it is a huge help. It's actually a time saver. It ensures that you don't get bogged down in sentence constructions. When we grade these, um, typically what we do is make checks in the margin every time you make a specific point and use a specific citation of a specific part of a novel. So you can't quote because you don't have the books in front of us in front of you. Although if you do want to use passages that are on the exam, you can quote from those. You can use parts of the exam for quotation in the essay. Um, but you do need to say, you know, when Morrison starts each chapter of the bluest eye with that quotation from the primer, she's highlighting how learning languages also learning a kind of racial prejudice.

Speaker 1:          26:23          And it's a kind of racial prejudice rooted in aesthetic appreciation. She highlights the colors that appear in the primer and the prettiness of jeans dresses. Okay. I didn't quote anything from the Bluest Tie, but I'm pointing to it in such a way that that would have several in the column in the margin. And basically what we do is we rack it up and we see whether for each novel you've made a number of specific points that add up to an argument. Now in this essay, this is the only place where, um, we really don't want you simply coughing up lecture or something that you've discussed in section. This is like the papers, something of an opportunity to draw things together in an original way. There are lots of threads that connect the novels in the syllabus. If you've been attending the lectures, you will already have lots of those in your notes so you can draw from that, but you should be thinking about it on your own for the passages.

Speaker 1:          27:30          Um, when you start to make claims about why the passage is important in the context of the novel as a whole, you may find yourself using arguments that were made in lecture or in section and that's fine. So it gives you the larger context in which you can show us that you're able to look at the specific words on the page and tell us something about them. That's the skill we're testing in the passages here. It's more your synthetic, um, knowledge and your way of bringing things together. So in studying for the exam portion, as I say, read over the paper topics and make a little list for yourself of kinds of evidence that you would point to maybe four or five bits of evidence for each novel or for a number of novels that might help you answer a question like that on the exam or sit and think, you know, read a question and think to your mind, okay, which, which scenes what I note which scenes, what I want to talk about. That's a good exercise, um, for studying any questions about this? Okay. Let me show you one more. So that's a very sort of, um, literary kind of version of the exam question. Let me show you something of a more, perhaps a cultural studies version. Here's one about work. The quotation is from plot against America, Philip Roth's recent novel, which is what I taught of his last year. So that obviously would, would not occur on our exam.

Speaker 1:          29:18          The men worked 50 60 even 70 or more hours a week. The women worked all the time with little assistance from labor saving devices, discuss the status of work in the post 1945 American novel who works and who doesn't, how is work represented, what kinds of work are valorized, what kinds are vilified, what is the place of labor in these novels, vision of America. So that's more thematic question. But in all of these, we really want you to be noting how narratives are put together, how language is used, what choices the novel made in privileging either description of character and development of character, development of setting creativity in voices and tones. So all those formal things that have to do with language choices would still be relevant here. You might want to talk about the work of the writer as that novel imagines that we've talked about that over on and off over the course of the term. What is the literary project? What does the literary project have to do with other kinds of work?

Speaker 2:          30:33          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          30:35          so generally, uh, partly because this course is, is cross listed in American studies. I like to have something of a balance between those very literary formal questions like that first one I showed you and this one which is a little bit more, a little bit more about a vision of America.

Speaker 2:          30:54          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          30:54          Okay. Any questions?

Speaker 2:          30:56          Okay.

Speaker 1:          30:59          You probably have your, um, probably have your

Speaker 2:          31:05          okay.

Speaker 1:          31:06          Ways of studying. Um, by now, even freshman have been here for a year. Um, let me just say a couple things about the process of studying and taking exams that maybe will be helpful to you. Um, my, my, uh, ideal way of studying for an exam is to you sleep.

Speaker 2:          31:32          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          31:32          Do you sleep strategically? Sleep can do amazing things for the consolidation of knowledge in your brain. Maybe some of you have discovered this already. Um, maybe some of you have discovered it's negative. What it does not do for you when you do not sleep, if you can arrange it so that you spend time. So you get all your reading done, read over all your notes, then sit down with those paper topics

Speaker 1:          32:05          and while you're sitting with the paper topics, that's when you move from going from the passive mode to the active mode. So you review all your notes, sit down with the paper topics in that active mode. Do what I was suggesting. Think of scenes that pertain to those topics for a number of the novels for each one. Just work through that for awhile until you can't do it anymore. And then go to sleep right away. Do not check your email. Do not browse the web. Do not shoot the breeze with your roommate. Just go to bed. There's a lot of research that's been done about, um, the effect of doing this without distracting yourself. You still get a benefit if you distract yourself and then go to bed. You still retain more of the knowledge the next morning, but it's even better if you do it without distracting yourself.

Speaker 2:          33:04          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          33:05          So take it to bed with you so you can sync right into bed, into sleep later. Even if you can only now, even for 20 minutes or half an hour, it still has an effect. So say you've only got, you know, you have to study for this exam during one half of the day and then you have to go and take another exam during the second half of the day. Take a nap in between. It's probably worth the half hour. You don't spend thinking about more paper topics or reading your notes over again are looking at the novels to do that. It's probably worth it. Okay. So that's my first tip. You sleep strategically. My second, uh, reflection on exam taking is that, um, you may, you may dismiss this out of hand given the profession that I then took up, but I actually used to like taking exams.

Speaker 1:          33:56          And the reason was that once you went through that work of reading things over, processing it after you took the exam itself, I always felt that the knowledge of a course was really my own. Then it came together in a, in a way that was much more solid for me then before I took the exam. So right now the themes of the course might just be a collection of memories or partial memories and in your notes and sort of chaotic. But once you study for the exam and you get some distance from it with sleep and you actually write the exam, that knowledge is really your own. So I would encourage you to see exam period, not just in this class, but in all your classes as a real time, an important time of consolidation. You worked very hard during the term in all your classes. I hope and whatever you did can really become yours in a new way during this time. So use it well and uh, and I hope that you'll in some way, some part of you will enjoy that process of, of really coming to own that, that knowledge. Okay. Any questions about the exam?

Speaker 2:          35:14          Okay.

Speaker 1:          35:17          Okay. Any questions about anything in the course?

Speaker 2:          35:31          You lie. Why do you say, talk a little bit about

Speaker 3:          35:38          this first day, but 1945 like particularly like what's

Speaker 1:          35:42          why post war well in America that marks, um, two things for me. One is the rise of the mass market and that changes, well actually I would say three things. The rise of the mass market changes the relationship between readership and the literature that's out there. So used to be that, um, high literature, uh, was not published in paperback, but the rise of the mass market paperback men that suddenly books that would never be accessible to a sort of average middle class or working class person suddenly became so, so it's a huge watershed in the demographics of leadership. So that's one reason. A second reason is related to this. Um, and that's that hundreds of thousands of men came back and went to college on the Gi bill who had never been to college before. Nobody in their families had ever been to college before. This also changed the readership dramatically.

Speaker 1:          36:46          It was a time of enormous, um, uh, an enormous boom in college enrollments. And part of that was a huge boom in English enrollments. Literature was a way for people who had never been to college before to feel that they were entering into the upper middle class because it was a kind of pursuit that was marked by its bourgeois prestige or its prestige marked, uh, you as bourgeois. So for people interested in raising their class status and it was lots of people, um, coming into the educational system, higher education for the first time literature was very important. Um, there's a whole story about why literature is no longer that class marking enterprise that it was it mid century. Um, that has to do with the rise of writing the competence in writing being more important than the competence in literary tradition to mark you as an educated person.

Speaker 1:          37:56          So that's an interesting story in itself. But um, in general, 1945 is the beginning of that. Um, the third thing is that by 1945, the innovations of modernism are really very well established. The big careers of early century literary enterprise are totally established and they have been assumed almost fully into the institution. Of the university through the new criticism. The new criticism was that method of reading literature that was, um, determining how people were in classrooms, how all those new college students were reading in classrooms, um, that set the agenda for what would come next. So in that context, someone like John Barth trained, uh, IX intensively in the new criticism had to decide what he was going to do as literarily ambitious writer to innovate. So it was a question of how could literature carry on and do something new. And there are lots of different answers to that.

Speaker 1:          39:11          And another answer to it. Um, that is partly the result of the Gi bill explosion of education. That's the changing demographic of who gets to read and who gets to write. Um, so women, people of color began to change the agendas of modernism simply by getting that education and entering into the academy. So Toni Morrison is a great example of that. Um, so as Maxine Hong Kingston, there was this sense that modernism had not even begun to touch on the experience of vast swathes of society and writers like Morrison and, and Kingston. We're very busy wanting to rectify that. So it marks a change that's beyond just a change in readership. The demographic change in readership and an education really begins to change the agenda of literature. So that's why 45 is my, my marker. It's a crude while I'm like all these things, you know, you can't say, well, why not? 1942, you know, it doesn't quite work. Work that specifically. Okay. Other questions? Well, the course about terms about books,

Speaker 1:          40:31          yes. Of the novels. We read one of your, you do, do you? Hmm. Gosh, that's really, really hard. Um, I do love the known world. I really admire it. Um, I think it's genuinely doing something new and that's hard to do right now. Um, so I love it and I loved it as a reading experience. Even when I first read it, it really captured my imagination. Um, I've always loved and hated blood Meridian. I love and hate Cormac McCarthy. I've spent a lot of time thinking about him, writing about him, reading his work. And while I'm really, uh, in awe of his ability, especially to use the far reaches of our vocabulary in English, I mean, talk about someone who really makes room in the language. Um, he can really do that. If you read the first few pages of a, of one of his, um, earlier novels, such tree, you get a fantastic image of this.

Speaker 1:          41:40          It's a very Joycey and novel that won the vocabulary. You just have to look up like every third word. It's really incredible and I'm really interested in the way he is focused on craft, both as a writer but all kinds of crafts, crafts. Like he has this play called the last stone mason. Uh, I think it's called the last last John Mason. We're just the Stonemason, the stonemason. Um, he's interested in these old arts like physical arts, like forging. There's a great chapter on, um, on, uh, smithing in a novel called the Child of God where the language of of the Smithy is folded into this. Um, meditation on aesthetics talks about what color the fire and the metal should be at every moment of reforging an ax handle. Of course in true McCarthy's style, the ax handle will then be used to chop up dead bodies and, and skin people.

Speaker 1:          42:39          Uh, so that's very McCarthy ask too, but at the same time I just find him frustratingly empty. Um, the road I adored, it was a terrifying read. I had insomnia one night and I started to read it at about one 30 in the morning and I finished it about five 30 and I was terrified. Um, it's, have I told you about the road when it's about, it takes, it takes place 10 years into a nuclear winter and it's about a father and son making their way down from Appalachia to the Gulf coast for no apparent reason except that the father seems to think that somehow there'll be able to survive better once they get to the coast. Um, meanwhile in this world, there are all these cannibalistic gangs that have started. A women are used to produce babies that they then eat a, it's really completely bleak and terrifying.

Speaker 1:          43:36          And that the relationship between the father and the son is extremely touching, you know, and I have a little boy who is about the same age and Oh my God, I was just doing, it was really terrifying to read this, uh, all alone in the middle of the night, I sort of got in bed with my son later. It is kind of cuddled with him, um, to remember that he was still alive. But, um, at the end there's this sense of the boy carrying the light. They, you know, the father says, you know, we're carrying the light. Um, we're the good guys. And the sun sort of repeats that by the end. I won't tell you what happens cause you should read it, but, um, there's this affirmation of that light, but what the light is, who knows? There's sort of a promethian narrative there. There's also a messianic narrative there.

Speaker 1:          44:28          Um, I think personally, my own reading of it is that it's McCarthy meditating on the end of his own life. Mccarthy is a very old man with a very young son, and I think he was thinking about his own death. And, uh, the fate of the father in that novel I think is very much about McCarthy, his sense of himself. So yeah, McCarthy is a tough one. Um, in Marilyn Robinson, I like a lot. Also, I like the beauty of her prose. Um, that Biblical cadence that Sheen, Mccarthy both have. I really like, I love the outdoor imagery, the nature imagery of that novel. And I love Roth for my own obscure and perverse reasons. Um, yeah, so I sort of have my favorites, but I like them. I really, there are things that I like about all of them. You know, interesting story about liking novels.

Speaker 1:          45:25          I hated Salinger. I really hated Salinger, um, because I found him so pretentious and effected. I just hated that tone of voice until I was working on this book on religion. And I read Franny and Zooey and here you can tell most of my great thought happens in the middle of the night. So I had been thinking about Franny and Zooey and I suddenly woke up in the middle of the night thinking, I know what style is for in the middle of, in Franny. And Zooey so I got up and I wrote it down. And um, that lecture that I gave on Franny and Zooey is part of my new book. And when, when the book was reviewed, uh, for presses, um, a part of it, I, one of my readers said it was the, it was the best reading he'd ever seen of contemporary fiction. And it made me love Franny and Zooey because suddenly I had suddenly I had something to think about other than like, this is so pretentious. I had a reason why, uh, why that, that tone in that style was there. So you know, thinking about books can really change your, your sense of whether you like them or not. It is self, sir. I know in a self serving way now who's pretentious? Um, okay. Other questions?

Speaker 1:          46:47          Oh yes.

Speaker 4:          46:49          Conversation with their roommate yesterday and we really like the bluest eye and there's one way we didn't read the loved one the more I said, well maybe because a lot of them, so Brian, a little bit American Asian American literature. Yes. [inaudible] just kind of buckled his academic snobbery to not to move below it. You must read the last grade, don't or not popular?

Speaker 1:          47:13          Oh, no, not at all. I used to teach beloved and I stopped because of that because we put it on the one 27 syllabus partly, and that wasn't here when I first started teaching. So the first time I offered this lecture course, one 27 didn't, and then we put it in place in the department. And because it was on that syllabus, I held off. I still think beloved is an amazing novel. I also have the length problem in that part of the period. I'm sure you didn't notice that, um, that the novels are along and that part of the syllabus, a beloved is another really huge novel so that it's, it's a problem. So I decided instead of putting it on there to rely on the fact that most people would either have read it in high school, or at least a majority would have read it in high school or in one 27.

Speaker 1:          48:05          And that I could count on that knowledge at least in a contextual sense. But no, it has nothing to do with academic snobbery. Now. I was, I used to get pissed off because when it was on the, um, when it was on the syllabus, I would always get certain evaluations would come in and say, oh, I don't know why we read beloved. It's such a, it's so overrated. You know, that was the snobbery and I that made me upset because I thought, well, that's just a failure of openness as a, as a reader, not to think about why it was so powerful. Even if you don't like it yourself, but your answer was right. It's, it's simply because it's taught a lot elsewhere. And then those other practical reasons of length. What else?

Speaker 1:          48:54          Oh, well, I'm sure. Yeah. Um, so let's see. What else would I put on there? Um, well, let me think. Louise Erdrich is interesting to me. There's a long novel of hers called, um, the last report on the miracles. A little no horse, which I think is an imaginative concede is really fascinating. It's this, the premise of the novel is that this young woman who, uh, is a, is a wonderfully gifted pianist who, uh, goes, I can't remember where she's heading. It's been now a long time since I read the novel. She's traveling and she gets washed away in a flood, a freak flood of a river. This is out west. And when she finally surfaces, she crawls up on the bank and she finds, uh, the body of a young priest who is on his way to be, uh, the priest at a mission on a reservation, on an Indian reservation, uh, I think in the, in the Dakotas.

Speaker 1:          49:56          So she cuts off her hair and she puts on the priest's robes and she pretends to be that priest and she becomes, she crossed dresses and is the priest at the reservation for her entire life. And I just think it's a fascinating premise, uh, for a novel. And it's very well done in her language is quite, um, quite wonderful. I again, uh, I'm ambivalent about it because I find the ending facile, um, it finally resolves all the problems that this situation produces in a way that I don't find a complex enough or challenging enough. It's just too easy to let it make it all come together the way she does. Um, so that's one. Um, let me think. There are like many, many other novels I can perpetually torn whether to put the road on. Yeah. We're blood meridian or some other McCarthy novel. I've taught at least four different, um, Roth novels spanning the period from 1962 the present.

Speaker 1:          51:05          Um, other writers now, I don't know why I'm blanking now that I, um, that I think about this. Um, hmm. Who else did I like to put on there? Oh, Eggers I really, now I fess up. I really would have loved to do what is the, what as our last novel. Um, I think Eggers now Edgar started out immature in the same way that I think Jonathan Safran Foer is, but he grew up as a beautiful thing. Um, so heartbreaking work of staggering genius, has a lot of that sort of, you know, kind of Cliche postmodern trickery in it. Um, but by the time it gets to what is the, what that novel is like nothing else, there is no equivalent of that novel to my knowledge anywhere in our tradition. Uh, it's just an astonishing inhabitation of another person's life. But in real time, I mean, I, I had, I was able to have dinner with him and some other people when he came as the slessinger writer a few years ago, and I said, you know, did you find it confining to give yourself over in that creative way to this other person's story?

Speaker 1:          52:26          He said, yeah, it was terrible. I would want to, you know, I'd be writing the truck went down the road, he'd have to call Valentino and say, um, Valentino, that truck was the road gravel or was it paved and was it dusty? Was there stuff kicking up or, or was it just flat? You know, it was just amazing. The, the degree to which he put his writing pen at the service of another person and their story. It's really remarkable. So given that extremely confining set up, he makes that novel truly literary in my mind. It has a real form. It has a very lively voice, um, and it's extremely powerful, fall and effecting. So that's something I would, I would love to have. But again, it's a huge novel. This is, the problem is so long. I, I think I just need two semesters. I think that would be better. Yes.

Speaker 1:          53:25          I haven't read it yet, but I have to say the reviews that I hear about it. So what is it exceeding loud? Incredibly close, exceedingly, incredibly, extremely, uh, extremely loud and incredibly close. Um, the structure of the plot makes me doubt a little bit because it's just another hunt. So it's this nine year old boy who loses his father on nine 11 and he finds in his father's affects a key that's marked black, I think has a little label on it. And so he goes around New York City finding everyone by the name of black that he can find. Um, so it has the structure that's so similar to everything is illuminated. That hunt structured just made me think, hmm. I wonder whether this is, I mean, is this just a one trick writer that he has this idea and this is what it's always going to be. A, that doesn't necessarily mean that someone is not a great writer. You know, Roth has kind of a one trick pony in this way too. Um, he has his own repetitions from novel to novel. Most writers I know do, but that seemed a little too, it's a little too close for me, so I don't know. I have to find time to read it.

Speaker 1:          54:48          Dennis Johnson, I did actually, I was very interested in having Jesus son as the last novel to, I'm going to write a review for the overview on Denis Johnson's, um, work by the end of July. So by then I'll know what I think about him too.

Speaker 2:          55:02          Hmm.

Speaker 1:          55:04          Other questions or shall I let you go? Any other questions? Okay. So I will see you at the exam and I think some, some sections are having review sessions. So check with your TF.
