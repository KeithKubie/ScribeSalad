00:00:00.094 --> 00:00:01.760
Let's see if we can
learn a thing or two

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:06.020
about significant
figures, sometimes

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:07.880
called significant digits.

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.020
And the idea behind
significant figures

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:13.040
is just to make sure that
when you do a big computation

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:14.610
and you have a bunch
of digits there,

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.140
that you're not
over-representing

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:17.790
the amount of
precision that you had,

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:20.900
that the result isn't more
precise than the things

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.214
that you actually measured, that
you used to get that result.

00:00:24.214 --> 00:00:25.630
Before we go into
the depths of it

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:27.150
and how you use it
with computation,

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.600
let's just do a
bunch of examples

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.180
of identifying
significant figures.

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.350
Then we'll try to come up
with some rules of thumb.

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:34.960
But the general way to think
about it is, which digits

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.110
are really giving me
information about how precise

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:39.720
my measurement is?

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.950
So on this first
thing right over here,

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:45.700
the significant figures
are this 7, 0, 0.

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:51.422
So over here, you have
three significant figures.

00:00:51.422 --> 00:00:53.880
And it might make you a little
uncomfortable that we're not

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.010
including these 0's that
are after the decimal point

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.720
and before this 7, that
we're not including those.

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.510
Because you're just like, that
does help define the number.

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.180
And that is true, but
it's not telling us

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:06.710
how precise our measurement is.

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:08.840
And to try to understand
this a little bit better,

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.600
imagine if this right over
here was a measurement

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:19.960
of kilometers, so if we
measured 0.00700 kilometers.

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:26.300
This would be the exact
same thing as 7.00 meters.

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.630
Maybe, in fact, we just
used a meter stick.

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.010
And we said it's
exactly 7.00 meters.

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:34.030
So we measured to the
nearest centimeter.

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.880
And we just felt like
writing it in kilometers.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.252
These two numbers are
the exact same thing.

00:01:39.252 --> 00:01:40.460
They're just different units.

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:41.960
But I think when
you look over here,

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.720
it makes a lot more
sense why you only

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.590
have three significant figures.

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.140
These 0's are just
shifting it based

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.107
on the units of measurement
that you're using.

00:01:53.107 --> 00:01:55.440
But the numbers that are
really giving you the precision

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.189
are the 7, the 0, and the 0.

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:00.480
And the reason why we're
counting these trailing 0's is

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.696
that whoever wrote this number
didn't have to write them down.

00:02:03.696 --> 00:02:05.320
They wrote them down
to explicitly say,

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:06.819
look, I measured this far.

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:08.360
If they didn't
measure this far, they

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.270
would have just
left these 0's off.

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:14.540
And they would have just
told you 7 meters, not 7.00.

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:15.600
Let's do the next one.

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.660
So based on the same idea,
we have the 5 and the 2.

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.330
The non-zero digits are going
to be significant figures.

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.560
You don't include
this leading 0,

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.610
by the same logic that if
this was 0.052 kilometers,

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:33.290
this would be the same thing as
52 meters, which clearly only

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.410
has two significant figures.

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.050
So you don't want
to count leading

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:52.770
0's before the first non-zero
digit, I guess we could say.

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.570
You don't want to include those.

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.370
You just want to include all the
non-zero digits and everything

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:03.750
in between, and trailing 0's
if a decimal point is involved.

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.150
I'll make those ideas a
little bit more formal.

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.720
So over here, the
person did 370.

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.636
And then they wrote
the decimal point.

00:03:10.636 --> 00:03:12.260
If they didn't write
the decimal point,

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.702
it would be a little unclear
on how precise this was.

00:03:14.702 --> 00:03:16.410
But because they wrote
the decimal point,

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.130
it means that they measured
it exactly to be 370.

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.990
They didn't get 372
and then round down.

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:24.360
Or they didn't have
kind of a roughness only

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:25.980
to the nearest tens place.

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.120
This decimal tells you that all
three of these are significant.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:34.100
So this is three significant
figures over here.

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:37.090
Then on this next one,
once again, this decimal

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:40.210
tells us that not only did
we get to the nearest one,

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:41.960
but then we put another
trailing 0 here,

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:43.890
which means we got
to the nearest tenth.

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.520
So in this situation,
once again,

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.760
we have three
significant figures.

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.100
Over here, the 7
is in the hundreds.

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.300
But the measurement
went all the way down

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:55.980
to the thousandths place.

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:57.760
And even though there
are 0's in between,

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.630
those 0's are part
of our measurement,

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:02.790
because they are in
between non-zero digits.

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:06.660
So in this situation,
every digit here,

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.970
the way it's written,
is a significant digit.

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.530
So you have six
significant digits.

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:14.830
Now, this last one is ambiguous.

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:17.209
The 37,000-- it's
not clear whether you

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:19.079
measured exactly 37,000.

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:21.089
Maybe you measured
to the nearest one,

00:04:21.089 --> 00:04:22.890
and you got an exact number.

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:25.430
You got exactly 37,000.

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.500
Or maybe you only measured
to the nearest thousand.

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:33.780
So there's a little
bit of ambiguity here.

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.600
If you just see something
written exactly like this,

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.629
you would probably say, if you
had to guess-- or not guess.

00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:41.170
If there wasn't any
more information,

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:46.100
you would say that there's
just two significant figures

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:47.690
or significant digits.

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:49.730
For this person to
be less ambiguous,

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:52.620
they would want to put a
decimal point right over there.

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.120
And that lets you know
that this is actually

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.060
five digits of precision,
that we actually

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:58.590
go to five significant figures.

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:02.690
So if you don't see that decimal
point, I would go with two.
