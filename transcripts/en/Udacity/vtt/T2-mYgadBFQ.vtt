00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.960
For this course we've provided a web app
that has a build script to compile it,

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:06.390
and some tests to run.

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.090
In order to run this app, your server
will need to have a particular version

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:14.330
of node.js, and additional packages to
be able to build and run the tests.

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:16.280
Without some automation
to make this faster,

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.130
it would take an unreasonable
amount of time to install it on

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.000
each development system and production
server you might have, this is why we've

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.740
decided to create a golden image,
we'll use Packer to do that.

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:29.690
Packer can create golden images for
different build targets, for

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:34.320
example, VirtualBox and VMware, for
use on your workstation, and also for

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.455
cloud providers,
like Google Compute Engine, Amazon AWS,

00:00:38.455 --> 00:00:41.170
DigitalOcean, and Microsoft Azure.

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.250
So you can run the exact same
operating system, libraries, and

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.040
everything else no matter where
you might be deploying your app.

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.000
Once this image is built, you'll
be able to use Vagrant to bring up

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.810
a virtual machine on your own computer
from that image, share a folder with it,

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:56.560
connect to it, see the app running, and

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.540
then change the app if you wish,
then build and run tests on it.

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.100
First, let's talk more about Packer,
how does it work?
