JASON SILVA: You know, I
love chasing epiphanies.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.410
I tell people that to
make art is a desire

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:23.420
to clothe inspiration,
right, to capture

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:26.830
the transient, fleeting
movements in which

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:29.420
the dots connect in a new way.

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.940
It's this idea that when we
are at our most creative,

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.230
we aren't even really creating.

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:36.620
We're channeling.

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:38.350
We're transcribing.

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:39.816
We are-- we are--

00:00:39.816 --> 00:00:40.670
[LAUGH]

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.200
--conduits for something larger
than ourselves, to erupt,

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.040
to express itself through us.

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.380
We become a medium.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:51.880
We become an instrument being
played by some other sentience.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.190
You know, this sounds
like the musing--

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.679
the muses, of the madness, of
the Greek creative people, who

00:00:57.679 --> 00:01:00.220
talked about being touched by
a hint of madness and something

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:01.928
erupting through them,
but not from them,

00:01:01.928 --> 00:01:04.349
and no one is with them,
and it belongs not to them.

00:01:04.349 --> 00:01:09.860
Creativity as a holy act,
creativity as divine grace,

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:11.670
it allows us to humble.

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.500
It allows us to succumb,
to surrender, to dive in,

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:16.250
to lose ourselves.

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.208
There's something kind
of beautiful about that.

00:01:18.208 --> 00:01:20.450
There's something kind of
beautiful about getting out

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.700
of our own way, right,
which people talk

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.950
about when they talk about
flow states and creativity.

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.260
Oh, my god!

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.560
When that happens,
that is transcendence.

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.150
That is to be in ecstasy, to be
beside ourselves as something

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.240
comes through.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.970
And that's, oh, that's
what we're chasing.

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.230
That's what we're
always, always chasing.

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.280
