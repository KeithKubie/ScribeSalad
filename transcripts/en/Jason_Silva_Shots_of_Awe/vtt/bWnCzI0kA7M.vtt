This episode of "Shots of Awe"
is brought to you by Toyota.

00:00:08.232 --> 00:00:10.712
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.000
So I'm really into the
topic of serendipity.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.940
Moments of unexpected relevance.

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:30.900
Moments in which you find
yourself looking for something

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.570
and find something else.

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.910
And what you realize
is that what you found

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.382
is more conducive to
your needs than what

00:00:38.382 --> 00:00:40.450
you thought you
were looking for.

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.020
And Erik Davis says
that serendipity

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.666
lives in the space
of juxtaposition,

00:00:45.666 --> 00:00:47.520
in the space of diversity.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.760
He says that juxtaposition
is the basic formal operating

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.980
space of serendipity,
the space in which you're

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.920
more likely to make unexpected
connections between subjects,

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.525
the spaces in which ideas, a
rich diversity, a rich ecology

00:01:01.525 --> 00:01:04.239
of stimulant ideas can
intermingle and create

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:06.910
these spaces of
innovation in your head

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:10.040
from just finding these unusual
combinations among subject

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:10.570
matter.

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.942
And he talks about places
like the city, which

00:01:12.942 --> 00:01:15.400
has density and this diversity
of viewpoints, perspectives,

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.210
and memes.

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.695
This supermarket of memes
that creates these unexpected

00:01:18.695 --> 00:01:20.320
collisions and creates
that creativity.

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.060
But he also talks about
places like Burning Man, just

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.440
this festival where
juxtaposition reigns supreme.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.520
Where a piano against
some stark desert contrast

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.005
is next to like some
overgrown dice alluding

00:01:34.005 --> 00:01:36.345
to like some Alice in
Wonderland-esque rat rabbit

00:01:36.345 --> 00:01:39.220
hole, next to something
like crazy naked girl.

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.890
And a juxtaposition
floods you with dopamine,

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:43.065
floods you with novelty.

00:01:43.065 --> 00:01:45.850
And just awakens
this lightning bolt

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.940
of meaning in the
perceiver's mind.

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.490
This heightened
pattern recognition,

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.290
that rush that we
associate with creativity.

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.022
So again, it's all
about juxtaposition.

00:01:56.022 --> 00:01:58.200
The juxtaposition
of extremes creates

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.850
that basic formal operating
space of serendipity.

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.300
