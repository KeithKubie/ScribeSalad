00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.710
Let's say we have a pipe again--
this is the opening--

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:07.380
and we have fluid going
through it.

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:14.860
The fluid is going with a
velocity of v1, the pressure

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:19.560
entering the pipe is P1, and
then the area of this opening

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.770
of the pipe is A1.

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:27.030
It could even go up, and
the other end is

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:28.280
actually even smaller.

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:36.940
The fluid-- the liquid-- is
exiting the pipe with velocity

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:42.950
v2, the pressure that it
exerts as it goes out.

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:44.880
If there was a membrane on the
outside, how much pressure

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.980
would it exert on it as it
pushes it out on the adjacent

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:53.580
water is P2, and the area of
the smaller opening-- it

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.300
doesn't have to be
smaller-- is A2.

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:05.710
Let's say that this opening is
at a height, on average, of

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:14.790
h1, and the water exiting this
opening is on average at a

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:15.960
height of h2.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.720
We won't worry too much about
the differential between the

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.260
top of the pipe and the bottom
of the pipe-- we'll assume

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.610
that these h's are much
bigger relative to

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:24.860
the size of the pipe.

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.150
With that set up-- and remember,
there's fluid going

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:38.070
through this thing-- let's go
back to what keeps showing up,

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.260
which is the law of conservation
of energy, which

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.830
is in any closed system, the
amount of energy that you put

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.290
into something is equal to
the amount of energy

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:48.605
that you get out.

00:01:48.605 --> 00:01:57.030
So energy in is equal
to energy out.

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.390
What's the energy that you put
into a system, or that the

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.970
system starts off with
at this end?

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:11.210
It's the work that you input
plus the potential energy at

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:17.180
that point of the system, plus
the kinetic energy at that

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.430
point of the system.

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.840
Then we know from the
conservation of energy that

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:30.780
that has to equal the output
work plus the output potential

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.110
energy plus the output
kinetic energy.

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.110
A lot of times in the past,
we've just said that the

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.710
potential energy input plus the
kinetic energy input is

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:43.680
equal to the potential energy
output plus the kinetic energy

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.260
output, but the initial energy
in the system can

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:49.580
also be done by work.

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.640
So we just added work to this
equation that says that the

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.650
energy in is equal to
the energy out.

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.900
With that information, let's
see if we can do anything

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.800
interesting with this pipe
that I've drawn.

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.960
So what's the work that's being
put into this system?

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:10.200
Work is force times distance,
so let's just focus on this.

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:18.410
It's the force in times the
distance in, and so over a

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:22.050
period of time, t, what
has been done?

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.740
We learned in the last video
that over a period of time, t,

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:29.510
the fluid here might have
moved this far.

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.300
What is this distance?

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.740
This distance is the input
velocity times whatever amount

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:40.880
of time we're dealing with, so
T-- so that's the distance.

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.500
What's the force?

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.170
The force is just pressure times
area, and we can figure

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:52.630
that out by just dividing
force by, area and then

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:57.890
multiply by area, so we get
input force divided by area

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:00.820
input, times area input.

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:03.870
It's divided and multiplied by
the same number-- that's

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:05.060
pressure, that's area.

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:10.010
It's equal to the input distance
over that amount of

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:17.779
time, and that's velocity times
time, so the work input

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:33.240
is equal to the input pressure
times the input area times

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.136
input velocity times time.

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:46.390
What is this area times velocity
times time, times

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:48.050
this distance?

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:51.670
That's the volume of fluid
that flowed in over that

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:53.940
amount of time.

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:58.400
So that equals the volume of
fluid over that period of

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:04.660
time, so we could call that
volume in, or volume i--

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:07.200
that's the input volume.

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:17.110
We know that density is just
mass per volume, or that

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:21.060
volume times density is equal
to mass, or we know that

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:25.410
volume is equal to mass
divided by density.

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:28.050
The work that I'm putting into
the system-- I know I'm doing

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:33.110
a lot of crazy things, but it'll
make sense so far-- is

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:36.880
equal to the input pressure
times the amount of volume of

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:39.280
fluid that moved over
that period of time.

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:43.020
That volume of fluid is equal to
the mass of the fluid that

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:46.590
went in at that period of time,
and we'll call that the

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:54.190
input mass, divided
by the density.

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:57.740
Hopefully, that makes a
little bit of sense.

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:01.140
As we know, the input volume
is going to be equal to the

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:04.070
output volume, so the input
mass-- because the density

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:06.250
doesn't change-- is equal to the
output mass, so we don't

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:08.800
have to write an input and
output for the mass.

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:11.290
The mass is going to be
constant; in any given amount

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:13.220
of time, the mass that enters
the system will be equivalent

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:16.460
to the mass that exits
the system.

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:18.800
There we go: we have an
expression, an interesting

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:21.810
expression, for the work being
put into the system.

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:25.010
What is the potential energy
of the system on

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:26.350
the left-hand side?

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:36.050
The potential energy of the
system is going to be equal to

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:44.180
that same mass of fluid that I
talked about times gravity

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:50.500
times this input height-- the
initial height-- times h1.

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:57.170
The initial kinetic energy of
the fluid equals the mass of

00:06:57.170 --> 00:07:00.170
the fluid-- this mass right
here, of that same cylinder

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:04.020
volume that I keep pointing to--
times the velocity of the

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:06.300
fluid squared.

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:08.620
We remember this from kinetic
energy divided by 2.

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:11.410
So what's the total energy at
this point in the system over

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:12.280
this period of time?

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:15.600
How much energy has gone
into the system?

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:19.080
It's going to be the work
done, which is the input

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:23.120
pressure-- I'm running out
of space, so let me

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:24.330
erase all of this.

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:27.265
I'll probably have to run out of
time, too, but that's OK--

00:07:27.265 --> 00:07:28.515
it's better than
being confused.

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:55.270
Back to what we were doing.

00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:59.950
So, the total energy going into
the system is the work

00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:01.760
being done into the system,
and I rewrote it in this

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:06.920
format, which is the input
pressure-- we'll call that

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:15.000
P1-- times the mass divided by
the density of the liquid,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.130
whatever it is.

00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:21.920
This is work in plus-- and
what's the potential energy?

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:25.720
I wrote it right here-- that's
just mgh, where m is the mass

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:30.187
of this volume of fluid, h is
its average height, and you

00:08:30.187 --> 00:08:34.539
could almost think of how high
the center of mass above the

00:08:34.539 --> 00:08:36.850
surface of the planet.

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:40.090
Since we have a g here, we
assume we're on Earth, so this

00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:45.440
is h1, because the height
actually changes, so this is

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:53.270
potential energy input plus
the kinetic energy mv1

00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:56.130
squared over 2.

00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:59.920
That is the kinetic
energy input.

00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:08.250
We know that this has
to equal the energy

00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:09.500
coming out of the system.

00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:34.700
This is going to be equal
to the same thing

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:38.070
on the output side.

00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:41.040
This is going to be equal to
the work out, so that'll be

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:46.530
the output pressure times the
mass divided by the density

00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:52.470
plus the output potential
energy, which will just be mg

00:09:52.470 --> 00:10:00.440
h2, plus the outbound kinetic
energy, which will be mv2

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:02.740
squared divided by 2.

00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:04.790
I just realized I'm
out of time.

00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:06.040
I will continue this
in the next video.

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:07.660
See you soon.
