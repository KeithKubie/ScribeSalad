00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.520
So let's see if we can
figure out a RAID 1 array.

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:07.310
Suppose we have a RAID 1
array with two disks, and for

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:11.186
a single disk we have a 200GB capacity,

00:00:11.186 --> 00:00:17.180
10 MB per second throughput and
the MTTF of 100,000 hours.

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:23.294
In that case, our two disk RAID 1 array
has a data capacity of how many GB,

00:00:23.294 --> 00:00:28.460
a throughput of how many MB per second,

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.350
assuming that we do equal
numbers of reads and writes, and

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:37.000
finally our MTTF is
equal to how many hours?

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.720
And for this type of RAID,

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:44.250
we also need to know whether we
replace failed disks or not, so here,

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.130
assume that we do replace the failed
disk and that the mean time to repair,

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:53.390
meaning the mean time it takes us to
replace the failed disk, is 24 hours.
