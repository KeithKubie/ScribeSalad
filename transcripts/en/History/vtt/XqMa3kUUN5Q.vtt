00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:02.540
NARRATOR: Rick
Lagina, Craig Tester,

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:04.790
and Charles Barkhouse
head over to the area

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:07.120
known as the Money Pit.

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.380
They are in the early stages
of finding out if recently

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.880
conducted seismic testing
has allowed them to pinpoint

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.500
the precise location of
the original treasure

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.330
site first discovered in 1795.

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:21.420
Well, got through here.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.380
We're down to 129.

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.920
NARRATOR: Just one day ago,
the team from Choice Drilling

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:31.380
began a new 6 and 1/2 inch
wide borehole known as DE6.

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.330
There's your wood.

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:35.210
Bring it on over.

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.880
NARRATOR: At a depth
of 93 feet, they

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.000
discovered evidence of
a horizontal wooden beam

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.080
followed by a 3-foot void.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:43.920
I love it.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.710
It was laying this way--

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:46.540
Yeah.

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:47.420
--not standing up.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:48.580
It was laying like this.

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:52.170
So it could be the
top of a tunnel.

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.880
NARRATOR: It was
at this same depth

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.420
that recent seismic
scanning of the area

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.080
revealed what could be a
network of underground tunnels.

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:01.920
That carries on
into what looks

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.960
like a larger network around
the 100 to 110 footish range.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.040
Flood tunnel?

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.790
Could be.

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.460
NARRATOR: Is it possible that
Rick, Marty, and their partners

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.960
have actually located one of the
legendary booby-trapped flood

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.960
tunnels, the tunnels
which many believe

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.620
were constructed
in order to prevent

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:23.080
searchers from finding the
centuries-old treasure vault?

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.250
What are you
calling the depth?

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:25.460
164.

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:26.380
You getting anything?

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:27.120
It's really soft.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.540
Right.

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.210
So you want to keep--
drill another whatever

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.790
until you hit something hard?
- Sure.

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.420
OK.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.420
NARRATOR: Although the team
is encouraged by locating

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.790
a possible tunnel,
they're even more

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.420
hopeful to reach another one of
the intriguing anomalies that

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.790
was detected by
seismic scanning,

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.000
a nearly 30-foot-wide
void at a depth

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.620
of approximately 170 feet.

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:55.920
It was at this depth last year
that the team, while drilling

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.500
with a 60-inch-wide
steel caisson,

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.000
encountered what they believed
could be the legendary Chappell

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.330
vault, a 7-foot-tall
wooden box first discovered

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.290
by treasure hunters
William Chappell

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:12.250
and Frederick Blair in 1897.

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.920
However, instead of
penetrating the vault,

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.080
the caisson is believed
to have actually

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.670
pushed the mysterious object
further down into the mud

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.250
and off to the side.

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.460
When we were doing
the big can on H8,

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.540
we had a plod where
the bottom of the hole

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.830
kept on being
pushed to the side.

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.210
So what was being
pushed to the side?

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:35.500
Drilling this well
might indicate

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.880
what was pushed aside from H8.

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.620
So we're looking for any kind
of evidence in that area.

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.830
Fingers crossed we hit the
vault or a debris field

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:46.790
from the treasure
itself falling.

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.460
So it was an
excellent place to be.

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:50.960
Well, I hope we have something.

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.960
I hope so.

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:56.540
What would that something
be that you'd like?

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:57.540
I'd settle for silver.

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.710
I don't need gold right now.

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:01.000
One step at a time, right?

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.710
Yeah.

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:02.290
Yeah.

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.920
We're on something
really, really hard.

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.920
Wow.

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.830
NARRATOR: The Oak Island team
has just struck an object

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:27.710
at a depth of some 200 feet
deep underground, an object that

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:29.750
seems impossible to penetrate.

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:31.420
What's your guess?

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:32.750
It looks like we
tagged something

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.330
hard, which we assume
to be interface,

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:36.750
bedrock of some sort.

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.040
A serious problem for you?

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:40.420
I think this should stop.

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.210
We hit something around
the 204, 205 range, so.

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:46.000
NARRATOR: Despite the fact
that the team had previously

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.460
recovered promising evidence
from this same borehole,

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:51.620
leading them to believe
they might have located

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.290
the original Money Pit
shaft, hitting bedrock offers

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.620
a disappointing development.

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:01.210
It means they may have missed
the large underground anomaly

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:04.460
that was indicated on the
3D map created by the team's

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:06.210
recent seismic scanning.

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:08.460
It also means they
will be forced

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:11.540
to choose a different site
in the hopes of locating

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.580
the legendary Chappell vault.

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:17.080
We certainly didn't hit
the center of the anomaly.

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:19.960
And, you know, that's
good and bad news.

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:23.540
But as long as the drill
is down hole, there's hope.

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:26.380
As usual, with all the things
we've done to date on Oak

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.210
Island, there's
things to be learned,

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:32.500
a few more questions,
a few disappointments.

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:37.420
Well, you know, the tunnel
to me, very interesting.

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:39.790
Either if it's an
original, it's fantastic.

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:44.000
If it's a searcher, it helps us
define where the money pit is.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.790
And we need to get
back and look at all

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:48.290
the different maps,
interpretations

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:50.120
of where those tunnels were.

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.670
Definite disappointment.

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:54.620
You know, we were hoping
to find, you know, a cavern

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:56.830
at this area, and we didn't.

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.830
It's just part of the process.
