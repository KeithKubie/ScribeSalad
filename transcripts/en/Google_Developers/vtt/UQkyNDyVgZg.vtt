00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:05.420
DAN: Hi.

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:06.200
CHRIS: Hi, Dan.

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:07.120
DAN: Hi, Chris.

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:08.330
CHRIS: So, uh--

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:09.130
DAN: Oh, OK.

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:11.580
CHRIS: Every pore,
every single pore.

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:12.330
DAN: It's amazing.

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.910
CHRIS: Yeah, hi everybody.

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.074
I'm Chris Debona.

00:00:16.074 --> 00:00:17.490
But you're not
really here for me.

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.250
You're here for our
friend Dan Lyons.

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.377
So say hi.

00:00:21.377 --> 00:00:22.960
DAN: Hi, that's
terrifying, thank you.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.001
And thank you for coming.

00:00:24.001 --> 00:00:26.795
And I don't know if we'll
have-- can we do questions?

00:00:26.795 --> 00:00:27.670
Or not really, right?

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:28.530
We'll just-- we'll talk.

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:28.820
CHRIS: Yeah, yeah we'll talk.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:29.710
DAN: Yeah, yeah, OK.

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.964
I did a talk at Google
Cambridge recently.

00:00:32.964 --> 00:00:34.630
It was really, really
fun-- really good.

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:38.004
It was full of-- I learned
a new word-- "Greyglers."

00:00:38.004 --> 00:00:38.920
CHRIS: Greyglers, yes.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.378
DAN: Which is what--
the people who

00:00:40.378 --> 00:00:44.080
are working at Google who are
over a certain age, lets say.

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.734
Either they call themselves
Greyglers or people call

00:00:46.734 --> 00:00:47.900
them that behind their back.

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:48.240
I don't know.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:48.440
But--

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.345
CHRIS: No, no they've been
calling themselves that as long

00:00:50.345 --> 00:00:51.220
as I've been here so--

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:51.610
DAN: Yeah?

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:53.040
CHRIS: Yeah, I
mean like 12 years.

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.498
DAN: And it was a
lot of Greyglers.

00:00:54.498 --> 00:00:57.350
Because my book is sort of
about being old and trying

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.590
to work in tech and in a
startup with young people.

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:06.090
So I had all these old Google
people-- it skewed very old.

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.590
And it was really-- not very
old, I mean like, you know, 40.

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.048
Yeah, there's a
guy with gray hair.

00:01:10.048 --> 00:01:11.850
See look at him he's
like a Greygler.

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.647
And it was great.

00:01:13.647 --> 00:01:14.730
It was really, really fun.

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:20.610
It was really, really cool,
interesting group of people.

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:21.110
Yeah.

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.380
CHRIS: You know, we don't
actually need you to like us

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.150
but it's nice that
you do, you know.

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:26.610
DAN: No, that's the other thing.

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.460
I forgot I had a little
spee-- I opened up

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.700
my presentation there--
so I really just

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:33.540
sincerely mean this.

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:34.640
I really love Google.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:35.950
And I know people hate Google.

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:37.020
They think it's like
the evil empire.

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.850
And I've always
felt the other way.

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.619
And my whole life is built
around Google products.

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:44.660
I realized this recently.

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:46.570
I've been using
Android for years.

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.110
Everything on my
computer is on Chrome.

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.910
I have Google Calendar, Gmail.

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:53.190
Basically my whole online
life is based around Google.

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.820
And I started out-- I
should do the same here--

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.710
by just thanking all
these people because I

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:58.626
know it's really hard.

00:01:58.626 --> 00:02:00.400
And I could never make
any of these things

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.304
that I use every day.

00:02:01.304 --> 00:02:02.970
And I don't know how
you guys make them.

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:07.160
But seriously, Google Maps,
and Navigation, and Waze, so

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.060
my whole life, I
realized recently,

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.055
is more or less based
on-- Google Cloud,

00:02:11.055 --> 00:02:12.930
you know the picture--
I put my photos there.

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.300
So I do sincerely feel
grateful to all of you

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:17.990
for everything you do.

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:20.910
CHRIS: I hope we continue to
earn that from you, you know.

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.280
I think I said that earlier
with the Android stuff.

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.470
DAN: For me there was a moment--
I was in Germany several years

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.094
ago, like 2012, and we were--

00:02:29.094 --> 00:02:30.510
CHRIS: So I'm, so
I'm so resisting

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.160
making old person jokes, right?

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.000
So I'm 44, so I'm old
by your definition.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.094
But I was like, so was this
before the wall came down or?

00:02:38.094 --> 00:02:40.070
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:42.300
Sorry, I just got to get
it out there, but you know.

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.790
DAN: This was when
there was still

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.160
an Austro-Hungarian empire.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.929
CHRIS: Yeah, yeah
the [INAUDIBLE].

00:02:45.929 --> 00:02:47.720
DAN: Right before they
killed the Archduke.

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.250
CHRIS: It was fake Franco.

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.870
DAN: Fake Franc-- yeah,
that was my first alter ego.

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.540
And-- no, but we were driving
into the Munich airport.

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:56.680
And I had an Android phone.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.410
I put a SIM card in
it and I remember

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.660
thinking I don't know if
this is going to work or not.

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.560
But we had a reservation at
the Holiday Inn Munich airport.

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.570
CHRIS: Which are
much nicer in Europe.

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.279
Holiday Inns are
much nicer in Europe.

00:03:08.279 --> 00:03:09.820
DAN: Well, it was
still pretty cheap.

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:10.500
But anyway-- you know.

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.220
So we're sitting at the
airport that-- and we're

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:13.900
flying in the morning, so
we had booked this hotel.

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.316
At the end of our-- it was the
last night of our vacation.

00:03:16.316 --> 00:03:18.240
And my wife said-- and
we're all stressed out,

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.490
and the kids are there, and
we have to-- and you know,

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:22.170
just everything's-- a rough day.

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.670
And I said-- I don't even
know where the hotel is,

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:25.220
I don't know where we are.

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:26.678
And I said hold
on, I had the phone

00:03:26.678 --> 00:03:30.500
and I said-- navigate to
Munich airport, Holiday Inn.

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.057
And I went "da dun, da dun,
OK you're on the right road."

00:03:34.057 --> 00:03:35.890
And I was like, oh my
god, this stuff works!

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:36.020
Right.

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.980
It was amazing to me.

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:37.480
CHRIS: Wow.

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.085
DAN: And I know
that's stupid, right.

00:03:39.085 --> 00:03:39.710
But it was so--

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:40.240
CHRIS: It's not stupid.

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.650
DAN: Simple.

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.066
I remember I
thought-- and yeah, I

00:03:42.066 --> 00:03:45.300
thought like how did a bunch of
human beings in Mountain View

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:46.093
make that happen.

00:03:46.093 --> 00:03:47.426
You know, how did that-- anyway.

00:03:47.426 --> 00:03:48.760
CHRIS: Wow, yeah.

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.520
DAN: I feel like the
unfrozen caveman.

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.220
You know, like your crazy
technology frightens

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.660
and confuses me.

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.326
CHRIS: I'm just a
simple caveman lawyer.

00:03:54.326 --> 00:03:54.850
Yeah.

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:56.689
DAN: Anyway, let's
talk about-- I'm sorry.

00:03:56.689 --> 00:03:57.980
CHRIS: You shouldn't apologize.

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:59.840
I mean, they're here
to listen to you talk

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.230
about random things in Europe.

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.020
DAN: Random things on vacations.

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.770
No, but thank you.

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:05.410
CHRIS: So congrats on
the success of the book.

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:07.500
I mean, you're all New
York Times best sellers.

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:08.250
DAN: Yeah, yeah.

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.580
CHRIS: So one of the
things I wanted to ask you,

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:17.149
is it bittersweet to have a very
successful book in print, when

00:04:17.149 --> 00:04:19.850
print is a medium--
so I searched

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:22.105
my e-mail for the earliest
mention of Dan Lyons,

00:04:22.105 --> 00:04:26.215
both how we first met each
other through our friend Erica.

00:04:26.215 --> 00:04:28.340
But when I first heard of
you-- and it was actually

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:32.540
in a Google alert, or
the equivalent, in 1999.

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:34.350
I was on the PR Newswire--

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.850
DAN: Yeah.

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:36.620
CHRIS: --like stream.

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:40.550
And basically it came
down to an article

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:44.146
about how Forbes is retracting
a bit in their print, right?

00:04:44.146 --> 00:04:44.820
DAN: Oh.

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:47.460
CHRIS: And so the
entire publication

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:50.520
is in a redesign slated
for a September debut,

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:51.409
smaller basically.

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:53.700
But then they say nice things
about what they're doing.

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:56.050
But it's a much
smaller publication,

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:00.300
because it's starting
to sort of wane, right?

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:01.359
So you write a book.

00:05:01.359 --> 00:05:02.900
You're like, oh, I
know what I'll do.

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:04.590
Print's dying,
I'll write a book.

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:07.520
I mean, do you ever like--
does this ever hit you?

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:09.480
DAN: Not until just
now, actually, just now.

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:10.860
Thank you.

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.194
Well, I mean most of the sales
are e-books to be honest.

00:05:13.194 --> 00:05:14.526
CHRIS: Yeah, and it's high rate.

00:05:14.526 --> 00:05:16.880
DAN: I would say that the
vast majority are e-books

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:21.491
and I think-- and audiobooks.

00:05:21.491 --> 00:05:21.990
A huge--

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.498
CHRIS: Did you
record it yourself?

00:05:22.498 --> 00:05:22.890
Or did you have like--

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:24.014
DAN: Yeah, I did it myself.

00:05:24.014 --> 00:05:26.960
No, I-- they wanted me to do
it because I have this Boston

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:28.580
accent and they
thought it would--

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:30.790
they like to have the author
do their own book apparently.

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:31.790
CHRIS: Yeah, no they do.

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:35.487
DAN: And so I spent a week in a
recording studio and I did it.

00:05:35.487 --> 00:05:36.820
But those are most of the sales.

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:39.797
I think that sells way
more than print, right now.

00:05:39.797 --> 00:05:40.630
At least on my book.

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:42.460
And the kind of people
who would buy this book

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:43.640
are probably e-book readers.

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:49.320
And I think in some ways it's
a better thing for authors

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:50.720
because it's a real impulse buy.

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:52.930
You can see something
hit the link and then

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:55.980
bam, download it to your Kindle
or your tablet or whatever.

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:58.610
CHRIS: Bam, download
it to your tablet

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:00.220
just because you've
heard of it here.

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:01.470
You see what I'm trying to do?

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:03.557
DAN: Yeah, yeah. [INAUDIBLE]
but no-- so there

00:06:03.557 --> 00:06:05.390
is-- I think there are
a lot of impulse buys

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:07.030
by people with e-books.

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:12.190
So no, I think books are still--
it's not completely over.

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:14.019
I mean, but it's a
tough-- you know,

00:06:14.019 --> 00:06:15.810
the book business is
obviously a challenge.

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:17.300
CHRIS: Really challenging, yeah.

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:19.622
Yeah, so I don't know.

00:06:19.622 --> 00:06:21.080
How many of you
have read the book?

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:21.915
Just raise your hand.

00:06:21.915 --> 00:06:22.600
DAN: Oh, my god.

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:27.170
CHRIS: And live streamers raise
your thumb-- whatever you do.

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:31.210
But you know, so it was
in fact sort of the trials

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:34.280
and tribulations of print that
led you to go to HubSpot, which

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:35.930
is the subject of the book.

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:38.730
DAN: Right, so in
a nutshell, it was

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:40.730
that I got-- I was
working-- I went

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:42.200
from "Forbes" to "Newsweek."

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:45.100
And I knew "Newsweek," even
when I joined which was 2008,

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:47.950
I knew OK that's-- they're not
going to be around forever.

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:50.120
But I really wanted to
work at a place like that

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:52.310
before the media business
completely blew up,

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:55.070
because I had very high
regard for "Newsweek"

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:55.820
and what they did.

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:57.010
And the people who
were working there

00:06:57.010 --> 00:06:58.390
were fantastic journalists.

00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:02.084
It was-- really, honestly,
I would pinch myself

00:07:02.084 --> 00:07:03.500
when I would walk
in there and see

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:05.580
the people I was working with.

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:08.570
And so I got laid off.

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:11.377
And I thought-- not only was my
company going out of business;

00:07:11.377 --> 00:07:13.210
my whole industry was
going out of business.

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:14.680
CHRIS: It was
heartbreaking, really.

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:15.430
DAN: It was very, very sad.

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:15.930
Yeah.

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:16.896
So, yeah.

00:07:16.896 --> 00:07:21.800
And I have young kids, I
have twins who are now 10.

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:24.045
They were six or seven then.

00:07:24.045 --> 00:07:24.670
And I thought--

00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:26.160
CHRIS: You were about
to go on a trip that

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:26.830
was going to be so much fun.

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:28.340
DAN: We were about to
go on this big vacation.

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:29.330
CHRIS: To Munich.

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:31.970
DAN: Yeah, that trip
that I was talking about.

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:35.140
And I thought, I got to--
I have to do something.

00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:37.380
I have to start a new career.

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:38.390
But I'm 50 years old.

00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:41.240
And I mean, it's
not that big a leap.

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:43.250
You can go into
public relations--

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:44.660
a lot of journalists do that.

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:47.279
And at the time that
I was looking at this,

00:07:47.279 --> 00:07:48.820
there was this big
trend that's still

00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:50.945
kind of going on-- it's
kind of played out though--

00:07:50.945 --> 00:07:52.960
where companies were
hiring journalists to build

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:54.160
their in-house newsroom.

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:57.030
So they had-- you know,
Intel, Oracle, Microsoft-- all

00:07:57.030 --> 00:07:58.420
have little news operations.

00:07:58.420 --> 00:07:59.327
Qualcomm has one.

00:07:59.327 --> 00:08:01.910
And I thought, oh, I could get
in on this corporate journalism

00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:04.990
thing and maybe start a
new career out of that.

00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:07.179
And that should have
a 10 or 15 year run.

00:08:07.179 --> 00:08:09.470
As it turns out, I don't
think it's really working out.

00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:12.059
A lot of journalists who have
gone for like-- and VC firms

00:08:12.059 --> 00:08:12.600
are big ones.

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:14.700
They're all hiring
their pet journalist

00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:17.510
who then writes about the
industry in a way that

00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:18.640
benefits their world view.

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:18.840
Right?

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:20.570
And Andreessen Horowitz is
probably the best at this.

00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:22.460
They have this
incredible operation.

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:24.260
They have basically
a content factory

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.690
with podcasts, and analysts,
and the whole thing.

00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:31.121
And they will turn out stuff
to their advantage, I guess,

00:08:31.121 --> 00:08:31.620
right.

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:34.450
So it's sort of quasi-legitimate
when I thought well,

00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:37.020
you know, there were no
other good journalism jobs.

00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:38.679
It wasn't like--
I called "Time."

00:08:38.679 --> 00:08:41.429
A lot of "Newsweek" people
who had left landed at "Time."

00:08:41.429 --> 00:08:42.610
And I called them and
they were like, sorry.

00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:44.540
CHRIS: That's like frying
pan to fire, though.

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:45.400
DAN: But I thought, OK.

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:45.900
But no.

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:48.685
They were like no, done.

00:08:48.685 --> 00:08:50.810
It's like musical chairs
in the media business now.

00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:52.500
Everybody's clinging
to their jobs.

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:57.580
And every year there's
fewer chairs and people

00:08:57.580 --> 00:09:00.120
my age are just
getting spun out.

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:02.280
And I'd read all this
stuff about reinvention

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:04.610
and you can start over
and be a lifelong learner.

00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:05.840
And I thought oh,
that's very exciting.

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:06.200
I'll do that.

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:08.074
And I always wanted to
work at a tech company

00:09:08.074 --> 00:09:10.476
because I thought
covering tech companies,

00:09:10.476 --> 00:09:12.621
you get very jealous of
the people you're covering.

00:09:12.621 --> 00:09:14.120
And you think, man--
it's like being

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:16.078
a kid with your nose
pressed against the glass.

00:09:16.078 --> 00:09:18.240
looking at this fantastic world.

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:20.200
Yeah, you go in and
you talk to them.

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:21.830
But you never
really find out what

00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:23.120
it's like behind the curtain.

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:25.300
Because it's all
stage managed and PR.

00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:28.050
But I thought it always
looked like so much fun.

00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:31.540
I had friends who went
to Microsoft early on,

00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:33.050
had a really good time.

00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:34.884
Yeah, so I went to work
at a little company.

00:09:34.884 --> 00:09:37.466
Instead of going to a big tech
company, I went to a little one

00:09:37.466 --> 00:09:39.040
in Cambridge called HubSpot.

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:39.540
And--

00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:40.950
CHRIS: It must have been really
close to where you were living.

00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:42.310
I mean, that must
seem like a dream.

00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:43.440
DAN: Right, so I
lived in Boston.

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:45.970
And that's the other problem is
like well, what tech company--

00:09:45.970 --> 00:09:47.720
they're all-- we're
going to have to move.

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:50.320
And that was kind of
disruptive to our family.

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:52.730
And I like it out
here but-- you know,

00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:55.060
anyway, I happened to get
lucky and found a place

00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:55.960
right in my backyard.

00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:58.370
So I thought OK, that's
a good, easy step.

00:09:58.370 --> 00:10:01.274
And it's a younger,
smaller company

00:10:01.274 --> 00:10:02.940
so maybe there'll be
more opportunities.

00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:03.850
It'll be growing.

00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:05.558
They haven't even gone
international yet.

00:10:05.558 --> 00:10:07.710
So there's all this
growth ahead of them.

00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:09.620
So that might be a
good place to be.

00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:13.140
CHRIS: So was it in
your HubSpotter--

00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:14.462
What do they call themselves?

00:10:14.462 --> 00:10:15.170
DAN: HubSpotters.

00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:15.630
CHRIS: Yeah, because--

00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:16.960
DAN: They were very much
influenced by Google.

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:18.402
So they wanted to be HubSpot-y.

00:10:18.402 --> 00:10:19.860
You guys talk about
being Google-y,

00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:20.930
there's a Google-y
way of doing things.

00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:23.010
And there's a HubSpot-y
way of doing things.

00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:25.110
We had those--
what do you guys--

00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:26.760
CHRIS: Sounds like something you
need to clean off like fabric.

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:28.969
You know, like with one of
those Tide pens, you know?

00:10:28.969 --> 00:10:29.760
DAN: Yeah, exactly.

00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:30.452
It's HubSpot-y.

00:10:30.452 --> 00:10:31.280
CHRIS: Oh, you've a
got a HubSpot on you.

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:32.720
DAN: Oh, you-- ha ha.

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:34.540
I do have one.

00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:36.320
And then they had,
what is that thing you

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:38.384
guys have for-- quarterly
evaluations, right?

00:10:38.384 --> 00:10:39.550
Or annual evaluations, the--

00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:41.540
CHRIS: Oh, yeah, so we have
the whole 360 evaluation stuff.

00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:43.550
DAN: No but there's--
like not KPIs or DRIs--

00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:44.620
CHRIS: Oh, OKRs.

00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:45.182
DAN: OKRs.

00:10:45.182 --> 00:10:46.390
So at one point they say oh--

00:10:46.390 --> 00:10:47.180
CHRIS: Objectives
and Key Results.

00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:49.130
DAN: Yeah, we're going to
have OKRs just like Google.

00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:50.310
But they didn't really
know how to do it.

00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:52.160
But they were like, well, Google
does it so it must be good.

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:53.110
Let's try doing that.

00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:54.895
CHRIS: And, you know, we got
it from someone out of Intel.

00:10:54.895 --> 00:10:56.394
DAN: Yeah, it was
John Doran, right?

00:10:56.394 --> 00:10:57.640
Wasn't it John Doran.

00:10:57.640 --> 00:10:58.640
CHRIS: It was John-- it was
one of those guys, yeah.

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:00.820
But he put it across the
valley and everywhere he

00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:01.100
invested time.

00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:02.390
DAN: So we tried it-- yeah,
we tried all this stuff.

00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:03.820
So that was really
cool and foreign to me,

00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:05.720
but it was interesting
to learn about it.

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:08.830
And so yeah, that was the idea.

00:11:08.830 --> 00:11:11.100
CHRIS: So you're in
this thing-- and you

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:13.544
said this in the book-- you
said look around the room.

00:11:13.544 --> 00:11:15.460
A year from now a lot
of the people around you

00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:17.010
won't be here anymore.

00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:18.600
Did they really
go down this road?

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:19.300
DAN: Oh, yeah it was
a lot of brainwashing.

00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:21.100
So it was very cult-y.

00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:23.607
And so, you know, journalists
tend to be very cynical.

00:11:23.607 --> 00:11:26.190
And it's-- the culture from one
newsroom to another sort of is

00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:26.670
the same.

00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:27.680
You know, if you
meet journalists

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:29.500
from wherever they are, they
generally all kind of-- it's

00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:30.062
a tribe.

00:11:30.062 --> 00:11:32.270
CHRIS: They like drinking
the brown water, you know--

00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:32.875
DAN: Yeah, yeah--

00:11:32.875 --> 00:11:33.130
CHRIS: Whiskey, whiskey.

00:11:33.130 --> 00:11:35.250
DAN: They're all
negative and cynical.

00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:37.800
And I was thinking I couldn't
get used to it at HubSpot.

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:39.500
Everybody was so
positive and so upbeat.

00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:40.190
And at one point
in a meeting I was

00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:42.800
like, you guys are all so
cheery, I just can't stand it.

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:44.550
And they were like,
well, would you rather

00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:45.860
be with negative, angry people?

00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:46.550
I was like, yes, dude.

00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:47.910
That's what--I've spent my
whole life with negative,

00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:48.270
angry people.

00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:48.950
CHRIS: The whole world is like--

00:11:48.950 --> 00:11:50.350
DAN: Negative,
angry people, yes!

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:55.440
So it is very
relentlessly upbeat.

00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:56.360
But we had training.

00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:58.200
And the training was
supposedly to learn

00:11:58.200 --> 00:11:59.158
how to use the product.

00:11:59.158 --> 00:12:00.800
But it really was
like you don't know

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:02.760
how special you are to be here.

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:06.980
Thousands of people competed
to get this job that you have.

00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:09.790
It's harder to get in here
than to get into Harvard.

00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:11.817
That's how exclusive it is here.

00:12:11.817 --> 00:12:13.400
Now, they're all
right out of college,

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:14.040
and they're young kids.

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:16.030
And they're all, you know,
freshly scrubbed and they're

00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:17.250
like, OK, I'm going to do it.

00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:19.100
And they're like, but
this is only half.

00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:21.270
The next step is whether
you can make it here.

00:12:21.270 --> 00:12:23.680
And half these people aren't
going to be here in a year.

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:24.596
That's how hard it is.

00:12:24.596 --> 00:12:25.985
And I'm just old.

00:12:25.985 --> 00:12:27.860
We went around and they
said you have to talk

00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:29.690
about what makes you special.

00:12:29.690 --> 00:12:31.150
Let's all introduce ourselves.

00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:31.760
CHRIS: What's your superpower?

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:32.613
DAN: Well, what's
your superpower.

00:12:32.613 --> 00:12:34.990
And they'd talk about
having superpowers and being

00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:37.000
rock stars and engaging
in "delightion" which

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.125
meant delighting customers.

00:12:38.125 --> 00:12:39.120
CHRIS: So that's how
you pronounce it?

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:39.200
De-lie-shun.

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:39.550
DAN: Delightion--

00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:40.675
CHRIS: I didn't [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:40.675 --> 00:12:42.305
DAN: It's delight
turned into a noun.

00:12:42.305 --> 00:12:43.836
Delight is already a noun.

00:12:43.836 --> 00:12:45.960
Delight is a noun but then
they made another noun--

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:48.430
delightion-- which is the
process of delivering delight

00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:48.970
to people.

00:12:48.970 --> 00:12:49.670
CHRIS: Is that a gerund?

00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:51.211
DAN: No, I don't
think it's a gerund.

00:12:51.211 --> 00:12:53.140
Anyway, so they went
around and they're

00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:54.690
like, what makes
you special, unique.

00:12:54.690 --> 00:12:56.182
And I'm like I don't know.

00:12:56.182 --> 00:12:58.432
I'm the only one in the room
that's had a colonoscopy.

00:12:58.432 --> 00:12:59.480
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:03.500
You know?

00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:05.090
CHRIS: I know what
my PSA level is.

00:13:05.090 --> 00:13:06.760
DAN: I have-- I have
high cholesterol.

00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:08.670
I have to take a
statin every day.

00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:09.295
I take Lipitor.

00:13:09.295 --> 00:13:10.753
You know, because
they're all like,

00:13:10.753 --> 00:13:13.139
you know, people don't know
this, but I play guitar.

00:13:13.139 --> 00:13:14.180
So I was like, oh, great.

00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:16.165
You know, but-- so it's like--

00:13:16.165 --> 00:13:17.220
CHRIS: I own a Corgi.

00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:19.950
DAN: Yeah, the main guy, the
training guy, his thing was he

00:13:19.950 --> 00:13:21.710
played in a rock
band, a heavy metal--

00:13:21.710 --> 00:13:23.280
a hair metal cover
band on weekends.

00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:24.920
It was like, oh, cool.

00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:28.110
But then the company would
hire his band for every event.

00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:29.560
I think they got them for free.

00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:32.600
So we had the same hair metal
band at every corporate event

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:34.100
playing the same songs.

00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:35.750
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:36.250
And it--

00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:37.820
CHRIS: Was it mostly
Duran Duran covers?

00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:38.780
DAN: Oh yeah, it was awful.

00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:39.738
It was just really bad.

00:13:39.738 --> 00:13:41.120
But he's a nice guy.

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:44.200
So he's probably going to
watch this now and hate me.

00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:45.922
But-- so yeah, so
it was like that.

00:13:45.922 --> 00:13:48.130
CHRIS: The world is filled
with nice people, I mean--

00:13:48.130 --> 00:13:48.690
DAN: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:13:48.690 --> 00:13:50.050
CHRIS: No-- no
matter where you go.

00:13:50.050 --> 00:13:51.520
DAN: No, no,
they're nice people.

00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:52.904
CHRIS: Mostly, somewhat.

00:13:52.904 --> 00:13:54.570
DAN: Just very chaotic
and disorganized.

00:13:54.570 --> 00:13:57.990
So the long story short is I did
this thing, it didn't work out.

00:13:57.990 --> 00:14:02.260
I realized after a while, oh,
you know, I don't belong here.

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:05.322
And I really should just be a
journalist or do something--

00:14:05.322 --> 00:14:06.780
and that's really
what I had to do.

00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:10.350
And then halfway through it, I
got this, call out of the blue

00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:12.870
to go work on "Silicon
Valley," the TV show on HBO.

00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:16.030
And it was like going from--
you know the Steve Jobs

00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:18.852
line about the ice
water to people in hell?

00:14:18.852 --> 00:14:19.560
It was like that.

00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:20.434
It was like, oh shit.

00:14:20.434 --> 00:14:23.480
I was at the Adobe
Digital Marketing Summit

00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:24.340
in Salt Lake City.

00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:25.700
I was going to kill myself.

00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:28.120
I was seriously thinking,
if you commit suicide

00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:29.900
in like Salt Lake
City in a hotel,

00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:33.070
in a Marriott-- I thought it's
kind of a horrible way to die.

00:14:33.070 --> 00:14:34.450
But I'm thinking,
OK, I'll do it.

00:14:34.450 --> 00:14:35.890
CHRIS: With a little
bottle of three-two beer.

00:14:35.890 --> 00:14:37.680
DAN: Yeah, I've got
a bottle of Ambien.

00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:39.950
If I took it all, I
probably could do it, right?

00:14:39.950 --> 00:14:41.624
I mean that's a
cowardly way out, right?

00:14:41.624 --> 00:14:42.790
You got to do it-- you know.

00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:43.820
CHRIS: I imagine
the Marriott has

00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:45.830
like a special elevator for
all the suicide victims.

00:14:45.830 --> 00:14:46.590
DAN: The suicides.

00:14:46.590 --> 00:14:48.089
Yeah, they get you off the back.

00:14:48.089 --> 00:14:50.380
So I'm like-- I'm seriously
sitting there thinking this

00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:51.680
is the worst moment of my life.

00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:53.976
This is as low as my life
has ever-- six months ago,

00:14:53.976 --> 00:14:55.850
eight months ago, I was
working at "Newsweek"

00:14:55.850 --> 00:14:57.183
interviewing really cool people.

00:14:57.183 --> 00:14:58.650
And now I'm here.

00:14:58.650 --> 00:15:00.274
And I got this
call saying do you

00:15:00.274 --> 00:15:01.440
want to work on the TV show.

00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:04.140
Because I had developed a
show based on Fake Steve

00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:04.785
back in 2010.

00:15:04.785 --> 00:15:07.410
CHRIS: So "Fake Steve Jobs"-- I
don't know if you're old enough

00:15:07.410 --> 00:15:08.720
to remember "Fake Steve Jobs."

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:09.980
DAN: See one guy, yeah.

00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:10.742
So I did this "Fake
Steve Jobs" book.

00:15:10.742 --> 00:15:12.010
CHRIS: He's like, Namaste, yeah.

00:15:12.010 --> 00:15:13.426
DAN: People don't
know this, but I

00:15:13.426 --> 00:15:16.410
wrote a book based on "Fake
Steve Jobs" that nobody bought.

00:15:16.410 --> 00:15:20.550
And then-- but it got developed.

00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:21.990
A guy from "Curb
Your Enthusiasm,"

00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:25.325
the guy who made "Bruno"
and "Borat," Larry Charles.

00:15:25.325 --> 00:15:27.700
He read the book and he was
like, oh, I really like this.

00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:28.491
Let's do a TV show.

00:15:28.491 --> 00:15:30.680
So I worked with him and
we developed and we sold it

00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:32.160
to a cable network called Epix.

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:35.180
We wrote all these episodes
and then it never got shot

00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:36.950
and it kind of all
just died away.

00:15:36.950 --> 00:15:39.800
But then the "Silicon
Valley" guys--

00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:42.162
the main writer on "Silicon
Valley" was also on "Curb"

00:15:42.162 --> 00:15:43.620
and those two guys
know each other.

00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:44.840
So when that show
got picked up--

00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:45.580
CHRIS: This Alec Berg?

00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:45.890
DAN: Alec Berg.

00:15:45.890 --> 00:15:47.870
So Alec Berg-- and I
had meetings with him

00:15:47.870 --> 00:15:50.490
about Fake Steve that
never worked out.

00:15:50.490 --> 00:15:52.132
So he said oh,
come out and work--

00:15:52.132 --> 00:15:54.090
do you want to come out
and work on season two.

00:15:54.090 --> 00:15:55.506
So I worked on
season two and then

00:15:55.506 --> 00:15:58.430
on season three, which is
the one that's airing now.

00:15:58.430 --> 00:16:01.377
I did go back to HubSpot briefly
after season two, but just

00:16:01.377 --> 00:16:02.210
for a couple months.

00:16:02.210 --> 00:16:06.341
It didn't-- it really
went downhill fast.

00:16:06.341 --> 00:16:07.840
But I had always
wanted to see this.

00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:09.190
You know, the
story people tell--

00:16:09.190 --> 00:16:10.930
every friend of mine who
works in corporate America

00:16:10.930 --> 00:16:12.888
has a story of, either
they did this to someone

00:16:12.888 --> 00:16:14.900
or had it done to
them or both, where

00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:16.830
the company doesn't
want you anymore,

00:16:16.830 --> 00:16:18.150
but they can't fire you.

00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:19.040
Or for whatever
reason they figure

00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:21.498
they can't fire you so they
have to just make you miserable

00:16:21.498 --> 00:16:22.320
so you'll leave.

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:24.736
Just make your life worse, and
worse, and worse, and worse

00:16:24.736 --> 00:16:26.574
till finally you just go, right?

00:16:26.574 --> 00:16:27.990
And they started
doing that to me.

00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:29.614
And I was like, this
is awesome, right.

00:16:29.614 --> 00:16:30.380
This is so cool.

00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:32.057
I had this crazy
boss who had been

00:16:32.057 --> 00:16:33.890
a really good friend
of mine but clearly had

00:16:33.890 --> 00:16:35.484
got the message,
no, he's got to go.

00:16:35.484 --> 00:16:37.650
And I was like-- every day
I would come in thinking,

00:16:37.650 --> 00:16:39.240
what is he going to do today?

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:40.270
This is so amazing.

00:16:40.270 --> 00:16:41.486
Like what crazy--

00:16:41.486 --> 00:16:43.360
CHRIS: Is this when he
started bringing Molly

00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:43.910
into the conversation.

00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:44.695
DAN: Oh, no, no
that was earlier.

00:16:44.695 --> 00:16:45.390
CHRIS: Was that earlier?

00:16:45.390 --> 00:16:47.848
DAN: Yeah, that was the moment
when I knew I didn't fit in.

00:16:47.848 --> 00:16:53.620
So a few months in I
had-- we got a message

00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:55.620
that the co-founder,
the CTO, had written

00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:57.650
this big article about
management for Linked--

00:16:57.650 --> 00:16:59.330
you know, he's a
LinkedIn Influencer.

00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:01.740
And um-- oh yeah, this
is our-- this is our--

00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:02.660
CHRIS: We're not really
going to take questions

00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:03.618
from the audience but--

00:17:03.618 --> 00:17:04.640
DAN: The gopher.

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:06.060
CHRIS: This is the Go Gopher.

00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:07.509
I'm sure you're
familiar with him.

00:17:07.509 --> 00:17:08.800
DAN: You can find this article.

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:11.020
If you look up
online Dharmesh Shah,

00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:12.650
and the headline
is "Your Customers

00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:15.380
Are Not Selfish Ignorant Control
Freaks," something like that.

00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:17.010
CHRIS: That's what
leadership is for.

00:17:17.010 --> 00:17:19.700
DAN: And his point was
that he had come up

00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:22.000
with this great breakthrough,
which was that you should

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.720
bring a teddy bear to meetings.

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:24.940
He was bringing a
teddy bear to meetings.

00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:26.250
And the teddy bear
would sit in a chair

00:17:26.250 --> 00:17:28.000
and it would be a
stand-in for the customer,

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.400
so that in the meeting
you would always

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:30.610
be thinking of the customer.

00:17:30.610 --> 00:17:32.150
You'd always be solving
for the customer

00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:33.260
by having the teddy bear there.

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:35.176
CHRIS: I'd like you to
address the gopher when

00:17:35.176 --> 00:17:36.330
you talk about this.

00:17:36.330 --> 00:17:38.030
DAN: Because he's the customer.

00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:38.880
CHRIS: This is our--

00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:40.080
DAN: And he had a
picture, he had--

00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:40.250
CHRIS: Delightion.

00:17:40.250 --> 00:17:42.350
DAN: A real picture, of a real
meeting, with the teddy bear

00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:43.225
sitting next to our CMO.

00:17:43.225 --> 00:17:44.580
CHRIS: It's the funniest
shit you've ever seen.

00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:45.410
DAN: Drinking a Red Bull.

00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:47.190
There's a little Red Bull
in front of the teddy bear.

00:17:47.190 --> 00:17:48.140
The Red Bull looks
really-- I mean,

00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:49.765
the teddy bear looks
really pissed off.

00:17:49.765 --> 00:17:51.150
And her name was Molly.

00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:52.990
CHRIS: The teddy
bear was named Molly,

00:17:52.990 --> 00:17:54.552
and she was a
single mother from--

00:17:54.552 --> 00:17:56.010
DAN: Well, they
had buyer personas.

00:17:56.010 --> 00:17:58.110
So we had Mary Marketer
and we had Olly Owner,

00:17:58.110 --> 00:17:58.950
who's a small business owner.

00:17:58.950 --> 00:18:01.033
So they combined it and
made Molly the teddy bear.

00:18:01.033 --> 00:18:05.570
So I worked with a guy-- my
boss-- who was a young guy.

00:18:05.570 --> 00:18:08.530
We sat screen to screen
at a table, at a desk.

00:18:08.530 --> 00:18:10.700
And he was pretty cool.

00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:12.190
He once wanted to
be a journalist.

00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:14.481
He was pretty cynic-- he
thought he was pretty cynical.

00:18:14.481 --> 00:18:16.000
And so this article came out.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:17.555
And I leaned around his
screen and I was like dude,

00:18:17.555 --> 00:18:18.846
did you read that article?

00:18:18.846 --> 00:18:20.890
And he was like, oh--
yeah, yeah, it was good.

00:18:20.890 --> 00:18:22.850
And I was like no, no--
the teddy bear thing.

00:18:22.850 --> 00:18:24.266
Did you read the
teddy bear thing?

00:18:24.266 --> 00:18:25.350
And he's like, yeah.

00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:27.060
And I'm like, OK,
that's crazy, right?

00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:28.000
That's freaking nuts, right?

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.249
And he's like, well, you
know, these startups are kind

00:18:30.249 --> 00:18:32.057
of-- they're kind of eccentric.

00:18:32.057 --> 00:18:33.390
I was like, no, no, no, come on.

00:18:33.390 --> 00:18:36.542
That's fucking crazy to bring a
teddy bear to meetings, right?

00:18:36.542 --> 00:18:38.000
And he was just
not going to agree.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.780
This guy had worked
at Google, right?

00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:41.240
Early on, right out of school.

00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:43.090
So I said to him,
are you telling me

00:18:43.090 --> 00:18:46.170
when you were at Google, if
Larry or Sergey announced

00:18:46.170 --> 00:18:48.524
that they were bringing
a teddy bear to meetings,

00:18:48.524 --> 00:18:50.440
and it was going to stand
in for the customer,

00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:51.740
and you were all going
to take it seriously,

00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:53.030
nobody would make fun of that?

00:18:53.030 --> 00:18:54.010
Nobody would mock that?

00:18:54.010 --> 00:18:56.727
Because I think they would
put him in a asylum, right.

00:18:56.727 --> 00:18:58.810
He's like, well, you know,
startups are different.

00:18:58.810 --> 00:19:01.350
But that's when I knew, OK,
I've got to get out of here.

00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:03.260
I called a friend of mine
who'd been a journalist who

00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:04.093
went into marketing.

00:19:04.093 --> 00:19:05.150
And said, is this normal?

00:19:05.150 --> 00:19:05.950
CHRIS: It's normal.

00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:06.680
DAN: The teddy bear thing.

00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:08.340
It wasn't that the
teddy bear was crazy.

00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:10.381
It was that nobody would
laugh at the teddy bear.

00:19:10.381 --> 00:19:12.160
That's what got to me.

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:14.530
In any newsroom there are
people-- there's occasionally

00:19:14.530 --> 00:19:17.670
some crazy managing editor who
might do something like that.

00:19:17.670 --> 00:19:19.900
But everyone would go
out and buy a teddy bear,

00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:22.834
and put bondage gear on
it, or hang it from nooses.

00:19:22.834 --> 00:19:24.250
You know, we'd do
terrible things.

00:19:24.250 --> 00:19:25.572
We'd sodomize the teddy bears.

00:19:25.572 --> 00:19:27.780
You know, we'd just do
terrible things to teddy bears

00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:28.830
to mock the guy.

00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:29.700
But nobody did that.

00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:31.110
Everybody was just like, mm.

00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:31.890
CHRIS: Yeah!

00:19:31.890 --> 00:19:33.060
DAN: This is awesome!

00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:33.560
Teddy bears!

00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:34.851
CHRIS: Let's win one for Molly.

00:19:34.851 --> 00:19:36.690
DAN: And when my book
came out, the company

00:19:36.690 --> 00:19:38.640
published a response to
some things, more or less.

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:40.110
The other thing they had
was when they fired people,

00:19:40.110 --> 00:19:42.421
they called it graduation,
which I thought was crazy.

00:19:42.421 --> 00:19:44.420
And they would say-- we'd
get this email saying,

00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:45.924
hey everybody, you
know, just want

00:19:45.924 --> 00:19:47.590
to let you know that
Derek has graduated

00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:48.520
and he's going to go off.

00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:49.440
And we're so excited
to see what he's

00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:51.911
going to do with his superpowers
on his next big rock star

00:19:51.911 --> 00:19:52.410
adventure.

00:19:52.410 --> 00:19:54.660
And I was like, you
fired that guy, right?

00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:56.249
You fired his ass.

00:19:56.249 --> 00:19:58.540
CHRIS: Like a ninja, he's
gone stealthy into the night.

00:19:58.540 --> 00:20:01.130
DAN: Yeah, he's going to
take his ninja superpowers.

00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:02.660
They would say-- literally
those were the words.

00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:03.350
Those are real words.

00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:05.390
And you'd look over and
the guy's desk is empty.

00:20:05.390 --> 00:20:05.950
He's just gone.

00:20:05.950 --> 00:20:06.760
He's just vanished.

00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:07.593
He just disappeared.

00:20:07.593 --> 00:20:09.030
And you never knew
he was leaving.

00:20:09.030 --> 00:20:10.560
My first week there I
had lunch with a woman,

00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:11.520
young woman right
out of college,

00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:12.710
who wanted to write a book.

00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:13.400
She's like, you wrote a book.

00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:14.720
Can you talk to me
about writing a book?

00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:15.220
Yes.

00:20:15.220 --> 00:20:17.189
We go have lunch.

00:20:17.189 --> 00:20:17.980
She's really great.

00:20:17.980 --> 00:20:19.890
She had these great ideas
about millennials and marketing

00:20:19.890 --> 00:20:20.515
to millennials.

00:20:20.515 --> 00:20:22.070
Great, we talked about it.

00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:23.469
And that night,
we get an e-mail.

00:20:23.469 --> 00:20:25.260
I forget it-- I don't
want to say her name.

00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:27.375
But anyway, you know,
so-and-so has graduated

00:20:27.375 --> 00:20:28.317
and we're so excited.

00:20:28.317 --> 00:20:29.775
She's leaving the
company and she's

00:20:29.775 --> 00:20:30.941
moving on to the next thing.

00:20:30.941 --> 00:20:32.608
And so I called her--
or I emailed her--

00:20:32.608 --> 00:20:34.899
I said, how come you didn't
even mention this at lunch.

00:20:34.899 --> 00:20:36.622
She's like, I didn't even know.

00:20:36.622 --> 00:20:38.830
She said I just got a call
saying you graduated, bye.

00:20:38.830 --> 00:20:40.030
Don't come back tomorrow.

00:20:40.030 --> 00:20:40.790
That's it.

00:20:40.790 --> 00:20:41.580
See you later.

00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:43.060
And after my book
came out, someone

00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:45.690
wrote to me saying--
first job out of college,

00:20:45.690 --> 00:20:47.140
she got hired to work in HR.

00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:48.892
Her life dream was
to work in HR which--

00:20:48.892 --> 00:20:50.350
CHRIS: There are
people out there--

00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:51.058
DAN: Not judging.

00:20:51.058 --> 00:20:53.040
CHRIS: They're very nice.

00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:55.935
No, seriously a good HR
person, man-- awesome.

00:20:55.935 --> 00:20:56.810
DAN: Yeah, no, right.

00:20:56.810 --> 00:20:58.210
And she had all
these big ideas she's

00:20:58.210 --> 00:21:00.125
bringing-- three months in
they called her into a meeting

00:21:00.125 --> 00:21:01.125
and said, you know what?

00:21:01.125 --> 00:21:03.790
You just don't seem
excited enough.

00:21:03.790 --> 00:21:04.530
You're gone.

00:21:04.530 --> 00:21:05.830
Take your stuff and go.

00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:06.460
CHRIS: Where's your delightion?

00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:07.910
DAN: Yeah, where's
your delightion.

00:21:07.910 --> 00:21:09.590
Don't even take your
stuff, they said to her.

00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:11.298
We'll pack your stuff
and mail it to you.

00:21:11.298 --> 00:21:12.990
Just leave this
meeting right now.

00:21:12.990 --> 00:21:15.720
Walk out, and go to your
car, and never come back.

00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:16.670
Three months in.

00:21:16.670 --> 00:21:17.640
And then they called
her the next day

00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:19.280
and said, uh, we didn't realize
you have a lot of stuff.

00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:20.410
You have to come in
yourself and get it.

00:21:20.410 --> 00:21:21.350
It's too much to mail.

00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:21.890
CHRIS: It's really heavy.

00:21:21.890 --> 00:21:24.181
DAN: And they had her come
in and do this walk of shame

00:21:24.181 --> 00:21:27.130
with a box and fill it up
and then leave, you know.

00:21:27.130 --> 00:21:28.270
So it's just crazy.

00:21:28.270 --> 00:21:29.789
And I called this
friend of mine who

00:21:29.789 --> 00:21:31.330
had been at a bunch
of big companies,

00:21:31.330 --> 00:21:33.210
like Cisco and stuff, and
then had gone to a startup.

00:21:33.210 --> 00:21:34.950
And he'd done really
well at the startup.

00:21:34.950 --> 00:21:36.852
And he said to me, look,
this is the secret--

00:21:36.852 --> 00:21:38.810
the little secret of
startups that nobody knows

00:21:38.810 --> 00:21:40.257
is that they're all like this.

00:21:40.257 --> 00:21:42.340
They're all out of control,
there's no management,

00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:44.150
nobody knows what
the F they're doing.

00:21:44.150 --> 00:21:44.960
CHRIS: And they don't
have any processes--

00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:46.334
DAN: Yeah, there's
no management.

00:21:46.334 --> 00:21:49.310
CHRIS: And it's like
25-year-olds who are like,

00:21:49.310 --> 00:21:50.940
wait, I have a staff
of how many people

00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:52.430
I have to-- whats a budget?

00:21:52.430 --> 00:21:53.010
What's a PNL?

00:21:53.010 --> 00:21:53.490
DAN: Yeah, yeah.

00:21:53.490 --> 00:21:54.794
So he's like, this is normal.

00:21:54.794 --> 00:21:55.460
Just go with it.

00:21:55.460 --> 00:21:56.660
And I was like, OK.

00:21:56.660 --> 00:21:59.434
And then I was going to leave,
and somebody else said to me,

00:21:59.434 --> 00:22:01.850
you've really-- you're a comedy
writer, you're a satirist,

00:22:01.850 --> 00:22:04.320
and you've stumbled
into this pot of gold.

00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:06.200
This is amazing, funny stuff.

00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:09.915
So I realized I
was so wrapped up

00:22:09.915 --> 00:22:12.040
in why the job wasn't
working out that I never saw,

00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:13.850
like, oh my god, this
is really good stuff.

00:22:13.850 --> 00:22:15.090
CHRIS: It's a goldmine.

00:22:15.090 --> 00:22:16.560
DAN: Yeah, for comedy.

00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:19.440
And then I started realizing,
oh, there was actually even

00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:22.000
a bigger story about,
I think diversity,

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.690
and about what culture fit.

00:22:25.690 --> 00:22:27.540
I think culture fit
is an insidious thing.

00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:29.250
I came to think that
it's actually a code

00:22:29.250 --> 00:22:30.780
word for lack of diversity.

00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:32.946
But if we celebrate it and
call it something good,

00:22:32.946 --> 00:22:34.570
it sounds great to
have a bunch of just

00:22:34.570 --> 00:22:35.930
white guys in their 20s.

00:22:35.930 --> 00:22:37.210
You know what I mean?

00:22:37.210 --> 00:22:39.410
CHRIS: We used to
talk about Googliness

00:22:39.410 --> 00:22:40.490
of incoming candidates.

00:22:40.490 --> 00:22:41.700
And I got tired of it.

00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:44.054
I was like, no one actually
knows what this means.

00:22:44.054 --> 00:22:44.845
It's just bullshit.

00:22:44.845 --> 00:22:45.817
DAN: Oh, really?

00:22:45.817 --> 00:22:46.650
CHRIS: In some ways.

00:22:46.650 --> 00:22:48.520
I mean, in the
context of hiring.

00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:51.180
Because it's just a way for
people to hire people who are

00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:51.870
like them.

00:22:51.870 --> 00:22:52.040
DAN: Right.

00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:53.330
CHRIS: It's like,
how about you find

00:22:53.330 --> 00:22:56.010
me somebody who you think is
the exact opposite of "Googley"

00:22:56.010 --> 00:22:59.040
or the exact opposite
of what you are.

00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:00.670
Within the realm of engineering.

00:23:00.670 --> 00:23:03.910
So it's like-- yeah, I mean,
it's these terms that they

00:23:03.910 --> 00:23:05.600
throw around so lightly.

00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:07.370
And we all chuckle
and think it's funny.

00:23:07.370 --> 00:23:09.884
But in the end it's like-- it's
people's lives your talking

00:23:09.884 --> 00:23:10.550
about, you know.

00:23:10.550 --> 00:23:11.049
DAN: Yeah.

00:23:11.049 --> 00:23:13.420
CHRIS: And so much of our
lives are spent at work.

00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:15.840
And it's like, we want a
wonderful place to work.

00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:18.449
But not at the cost
of our humanity.

00:23:18.449 --> 00:23:19.990
So I don't-- I don't
want to go off--

00:23:19.990 --> 00:23:20.490
DAN: No, no I agree.

00:23:20.490 --> 00:23:22.310
And I think, you know,
they said that when

00:23:22.310 --> 00:23:23.640
I first met some of these guys.

00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:25.580
They said the line that you
hear a lot in Silicon Valley,

00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:26.730
with startups,
anyway, was like, we

00:23:26.730 --> 00:23:28.900
like to hire people that
I'd like to go for a beer

00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:30.100
with after work.

00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:30.600
Right?

00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:33.946
And I think that's a terrible
reason to hire someone.

00:23:33.946 --> 00:23:35.320
CHRIS: Or finger
paint with them.

00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:36.100
DAN: Yeah, we did
finger painting.

00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:37.683
We had a thing called
fearless Friday.

00:23:37.683 --> 00:23:38.960
We got this email one day.

00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:40.210
You want me to tell the story.

00:23:40.210 --> 00:23:43.630
So saying OK, someone--
one of the people on staff

00:23:43.630 --> 00:23:45.390
had read Sheryl Sandberg's book.

00:23:45.390 --> 00:23:47.550
And there's something in
there about-- her advice

00:23:47.550 --> 00:23:49.540
was do what you would do
if you weren't afraid.

00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:50.250
Like you know--

00:23:50.250 --> 00:23:51.150
CHRIS: Which is decent advice.

00:23:51.150 --> 00:23:52.110
DAN: It's good advice.

00:23:52.110 --> 00:23:55.156
So next-- two weeks
from now on Friday

00:23:55.156 --> 00:23:56.530
it's going to be
fearless Friday.

00:23:56.530 --> 00:23:59.109
We're going to all stop
work for the whole day.

00:23:59.109 --> 00:24:00.150
That was the other thing.

00:24:00.150 --> 00:24:01.650
They had the whole Google
idea of the 20% off.

00:24:01.650 --> 00:24:02.950
Which Google doesn't
do anymore, right?

00:24:02.950 --> 00:24:03.950
CHRIS: No, no, we do it.

00:24:03.950 --> 00:24:06.997
But it's, honestly, for most
people this means 120% of time.

00:24:06.997 --> 00:24:07.580
DAN: Oh, yeah.

00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:09.954
CHRIS: So actually I did the
math early on in my career--

00:24:09.954 --> 00:24:12.000
it was, like, 2007--
where I added up

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:13.820
all the Tech Talks
that you could go to,

00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:15.530
and the 20% time,
and all the rest.

00:24:15.530 --> 00:24:18.590
And you end up working
about 14 hours a week

00:24:18.590 --> 00:24:20.790
if you take all the breaks
and all the lunches.

00:24:20.790 --> 00:24:21.540
DAN: Sounds great.

00:24:21.540 --> 00:24:23.250
CHRIS: And I'm
like, you know, that

00:24:23.250 --> 00:24:25.400
doesn't sound like it's real.

00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:26.110
You know.

00:24:26.110 --> 00:24:26.720
DAN: So it doesn't really--

00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:29.520
CHRIS: No, so, obviously people
don't go to every Tech Talk.

00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:31.995
Not everyone does 20%
time, or even, I'd

00:24:31.995 --> 00:24:33.510
say, single percentage points.

00:24:33.510 --> 00:24:34.170
But that's OK.

00:24:34.170 --> 00:24:35.680
I mean, it's there for them.

00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:39.060
But reality is our jobs
are there for us, too.

00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:41.862
I'm a big believer in doing the
job that you were hired to do.

00:24:41.862 --> 00:24:44.320
I mean, we talked about this
earlier and the honor of that.

00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:46.990
So when things like
fearless Friday come up,

00:24:46.990 --> 00:24:47.870
what do you think?

00:24:47.870 --> 00:24:51.212
You're like, wait, you want me
to come to work and not work?

00:24:51.212 --> 00:24:53.170
DAN: Right, we have to
do-- the only rule was--

00:24:53.170 --> 00:24:53.930
CHRIS: And in the
newsroom, they're

00:24:53.930 --> 00:24:56.416
like where is the article,
this is the deadline, produce,

00:24:56.416 --> 00:24:57.090
right?

00:24:57.090 --> 00:24:58.590
DAN: Unfortunately,
now in newsrooms

00:24:58.590 --> 00:25:00.600
it's also become like
you've got to hit numbers.

00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:02.984
You've got to get clicks,
drive [? pagers ?]

00:25:02.984 --> 00:25:04.400
and you're rewarded
based on that.

00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:07.840
So that's part of the
reason that this coverage

00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:09.820
of tech and everything
else has become so bad.

00:25:09.820 --> 00:25:10.480
And I think--

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:12.230
CHRIS: That's
[? fan fiction, ?] you know?

00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:13.820
DAN: Well, it's
just that if you're

00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:17.080
working for a tech blog, or
the "New York Times," whatever,

00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:19.690
if you cover Apple and
you're very pro-Apple so you

00:25:19.690 --> 00:25:20.860
get a little bit of access.

00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:21.930
You're going to
get [? pay juice ?]

00:25:21.930 --> 00:25:24.330
because you're going to get--
people will read your articles

00:25:24.330 --> 00:25:24.920
and they'll love it.

00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:26.790
It's like the easiest-- that's
why "Fake Steve" took off.

00:25:26.790 --> 00:25:28.706
It wasn't because I was
writing anything good.

00:25:28.706 --> 00:25:30.950
It was just that there's
such a huge Apple base.

00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:32.970
And I realized,
oh god-- and I've

00:25:32.970 --> 00:25:34.680
seen reporters tap into that.

00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:37.515
If you tap in and become like
the Apple fanboy reporter--

00:25:37.515 --> 00:25:38.640
CHRIS: It's very appealing.

00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:42.230
Because those numbers go up and
you're like, look, I'm popular

00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:43.970
and it fills you with
that warm feeling.

00:25:43.970 --> 00:25:45.540
DAN: Not only that, you're
getting bonused at work.

00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:46.250
CHRIS: And getting
money is nice too.

00:25:46.250 --> 00:25:48.090
DAN: You're straight up
bonused based on your traffic.

00:25:48.090 --> 00:25:49.540
I mean-- and if you're
not getting traffic

00:25:49.540 --> 00:25:50.623
you're going to get fired.

00:25:50.623 --> 00:25:53.680
Like it's-- the way
to get traffic--

00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:58.127
like if you're stuck covering
Enterprise, you know.

00:25:58.127 --> 00:25:59.960
I mean, it's important
stuff to cover but it

00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:01.260
doesn't drive page views.

00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:03.135
So you end up having to
do 10 articles a day.

00:26:03.135 --> 00:26:05.009
You're just trying to
win with volume, right.

00:26:05.009 --> 00:26:06.720
So then you can't do
any real reporting.

00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:08.710
You can't do any kind
of real journalism.

00:26:08.710 --> 00:26:10.560
You're just aggregating
other stories

00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:12.200
and putting some top spin on it.

00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:16.030
And maybe trying to be--
you can try to get attention

00:26:16.030 --> 00:26:17.390
by being outrageous.

00:26:17.390 --> 00:26:19.590
You see the bloggers
who are really combative

00:26:19.590 --> 00:26:20.730
and love to pick fights.

00:26:20.730 --> 00:26:23.110
So you get all this--
it's just entertainment.

00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:25.590
And that's, I mean, that's
actually a very serious problem

00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:26.506
in the media business.

00:26:26.506 --> 00:26:28.500
And I don't know
how it gets fixed.

00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:32.170
Because unless people stop
measuring and rewarding

00:26:32.170 --> 00:26:34.590
people on traffic,
on numbers, it's

00:26:34.590 --> 00:26:37.994
going to be very hard to--
it's a race to the bottom.

00:26:37.994 --> 00:26:39.410
It just becomes a
complete-- yeah.

00:26:39.410 --> 00:26:41.584
CHRIS: I mean, do you think
we've hit a bottom yet?

00:26:41.584 --> 00:26:43.750
I mean, it seems like they
keep on trying, you know.

00:26:43.750 --> 00:26:45.875
DAN: Well, Donald Trump is
the Republican candidate

00:26:45.875 --> 00:26:48.484
for president.

00:26:48.484 --> 00:26:49.150
So I don't know.

00:26:49.150 --> 00:26:50.030
I think we're still heading--

00:26:50.030 --> 00:26:51.696
CHRIS: I assure you
my fingers are long.

00:26:51.696 --> 00:26:53.550
DAN: Believe it
or not it's 2016.

00:26:53.550 --> 00:26:56.280
Let's just put
this on the record.

00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:57.490
No, I mean that happened.

00:26:57.490 --> 00:26:57.990
Right?

00:26:57.990 --> 00:26:59.310
That really happened.

00:26:59.310 --> 00:27:01.360
And the media, I think,
is complicit in that.

00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:04.900
I think there's a reason for
it because Trump gets ratings.

00:27:04.900 --> 00:27:06.150
They love putting him on TV.

00:27:06.150 --> 00:27:07.880
It's driven by--
it's the same thing.

00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:09.170
It's clicks and views, right.

00:27:09.170 --> 00:27:12.540
And he's the best thing that
ever happened to TV news.

00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:16.889
And I think print journalism
didn't used to be like that.

00:27:16.889 --> 00:27:18.430
But they've been
dragged into it now.

00:27:18.430 --> 00:27:21.510
If you're a reporter
it's a reality.

00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:23.380
It's part of your life.

00:27:23.380 --> 00:27:25.980
And I'm sorry--

00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:27.390
CHRIS: It's OK.

00:27:27.390 --> 00:27:28.990
DAN: It's a bad-- oh god.

00:27:28.990 --> 00:27:31.320
No, so this is why
writing books is better.

00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:32.820
Because you can actually
go off and write a book.

00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:33.620
You can spend a year.

00:27:33.620 --> 00:27:34.680
You can do some reporting.

00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:36.846
You can write what you want
to write and publish it.

00:27:36.846 --> 00:27:38.404
And maybe you make a living.

00:27:38.404 --> 00:27:40.612
I mean, I don't think you--
I don't think-- you know,

00:27:40.612 --> 00:27:43.110
one in a million books you
really make a lot of money on.

00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:44.390
But at least you can
probably make a living

00:27:44.390 --> 00:27:44.950
and do what you want.

00:27:44.950 --> 00:27:46.490
So that's what I found
when I was doing this.

00:27:46.490 --> 00:27:48.906
I was like well at least I can
write what I want to write.

00:27:48.906 --> 00:27:51.940
And it's far from perfect.

00:27:51.940 --> 00:27:55.217
And I would rewrite-- I would
always go back and rewrite

00:27:55.217 --> 00:27:56.050
anything and fix it.

00:27:56.050 --> 00:27:56.591
But whatever.

00:27:56.591 --> 00:27:59.270
You can do your work and do
something you believe in.

00:27:59.270 --> 00:28:02.054
And maybe that's a way
out for a media person.

00:28:02.054 --> 00:28:03.720
CHRIS: So in the
description of the book

00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:05.299
you say look--
basically-- look what

00:28:05.299 --> 00:28:07.590
happens when an old guy goes
to a young company, right?

00:28:07.590 --> 00:28:08.090
DAN: Yeah.

00:28:08.090 --> 00:28:11.710
CHRIS: And so-- if you want
to go to the next slide--

00:28:11.710 --> 00:28:17.570
so in some ways you were
anticipating the criticism.

00:28:17.570 --> 00:28:19.320
But in some ways,
when you said that

00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:21.610
you sort of drove the
criticism in that direction.

00:28:21.610 --> 00:28:23.193
I mean, you're not--
you don't present

00:28:23.193 --> 00:28:26.820
as an especially Grandpa
Simpson sort of-- we

00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:30.300
can switch back to
the other slide.

00:28:30.300 --> 00:28:32.930
DAN: I actually have-- and one
of my epigraphs, I have two.

00:28:32.930 --> 00:28:35.514
One is Dante, Dante's
"Inferno," which

00:28:35.514 --> 00:28:37.680
is essentially a book about
a midlife crisis, right.

00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:40.410
And then midway through
this veil of-- whatever,

00:28:40.410 --> 00:28:42.950
I stumbled into a dark path.

00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:46.330
Then the other quote is
from Grandpa Simpson.

00:28:46.330 --> 00:28:50.604
Saying something like I used
to be what's it, but then

00:28:50.604 --> 00:28:53.020
they changed what it is and
now I'm not with it-- oh yeah,

00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:55.311
I used to be with it but then
they changed what it was.

00:28:55.311 --> 00:28:58.400
What I'm with isn't it and
what it is I'm not with.

00:28:58.400 --> 00:28:59.430
So I get it.

00:28:59.430 --> 00:29:00.897
No, I felt really old.

00:29:00.897 --> 00:29:02.230
And I never had felt old before.

00:29:02.230 --> 00:29:04.280
But one guy at HubSpot he
used to call me grandpa.

00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:05.510
That was like his name for me.

00:29:05.510 --> 00:29:06.010
CHRIS: Seriously?

00:29:06.010 --> 00:29:06.510
DAN: Yeah.

00:29:06.510 --> 00:29:07.320
CHRIS: That's really--

00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:07.970
DAN: Yeah, I'd
always be like, hey.

00:29:07.970 --> 00:29:10.120
CHRIS: That guy
was kind of a jerk.

00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:11.570
DAN: Well, yeah.

00:29:11.570 --> 00:29:14.910
He was not, he was
not-- I don't know.

00:29:14.910 --> 00:29:16.170
CHRIS: Sorry, scallywag.

00:29:16.170 --> 00:29:18.100
DAN: He was a
young, young fellow.

00:29:18.100 --> 00:29:19.890
He was-- it was OK.

00:29:19.890 --> 00:29:23.600
But yeah, so I never felt-- I
never felt really old before.

00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:25.550
But there's little bits
and pieces of that,

00:29:25.550 --> 00:29:27.758
that felt like-- and that
was sort of their response,

00:29:27.758 --> 00:29:29.770
was that people don't like.

00:29:29.770 --> 00:29:31.899
They think, oh it's an
angry old guy ranting

00:29:31.899 --> 00:29:33.190
about working with millennials.

00:29:33.190 --> 00:29:35.560
And I don't have any
hatred of millennials.

00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:36.090
I was fine.

00:29:36.090 --> 00:29:38.530
I love-- I actually was excited
to work with young people

00:29:38.530 --> 00:29:40.280
because I love that people
would have new ideas.

00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:42.780
And the one big problem in the
media business where I'd been

00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:46.067
was that you're stuck
in a legacy company that

00:29:46.067 --> 00:29:48.150
has a legacy world, where
for better or for worse,

00:29:48.150 --> 00:29:49.941
you have people inside
that want to change.

00:29:49.941 --> 00:29:52.380
But it's very hard to
change an old company

00:29:52.380 --> 00:29:53.957
and make it do
things in a new way.

00:29:53.957 --> 00:29:55.040
It's just very, very hard.

00:29:55.040 --> 00:29:57.040
And it's not because
they're bad people, either.

00:29:57.040 --> 00:29:59.530
I mean, it's just that you're
encumbered with this legacy.

00:29:59.530 --> 00:30:02.224
And I thought, you know,
maybe corporate journalism,

00:30:02.224 --> 00:30:03.640
maybe what people
are doing there,

00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:06.090
is going to be something--
some part of how media gets

00:30:06.090 --> 00:30:06.910
reinvented.

00:30:06.910 --> 00:30:08.710
I don't think where
I was specifically is

00:30:08.710 --> 00:30:11.140
going to be part of that.

00:30:11.140 --> 00:30:13.060
But things like BuzzFeed
are easy to sort of

00:30:13.060 --> 00:30:13.890
dismiss as silly.

00:30:13.890 --> 00:30:15.920
But then maybe they're doing
some good, interesting stuff.

00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:16.595
CHRIS: Yeah, every
once in a while they'll

00:30:16.595 --> 00:30:18.910
do an article that's
just astonishingly good

00:30:18.910 --> 00:30:20.660
and you're like, where
did that come from.

00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:22.210
DAN: I mean, somebody is going
to reinvent the media business.

00:30:22.210 --> 00:30:24.001
I don't know where it's
going to come from.

00:30:24.001 --> 00:30:25.280
And it needs a business model.

00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:27.541
CHRIS: So when ol' media
called you, HBO says, hey.

00:30:27.541 --> 00:30:29.040
DAN: Yeah, I respond
in a heartbeat.

00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:30.240
CHRIS: You're like, I'm out!

00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:31.700
TV's calling, you know.

00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:33.200
DAN: Yeah, and TV,
mind you, I think

00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:36.302
TV-- the TV business model
is challenged in a way--

00:30:36.302 --> 00:30:38.510
or is about to be-- the way
the magazine business was

00:30:38.510 --> 00:30:39.270
20 years ago.

00:30:39.270 --> 00:30:42.600
I think they are heading
into a period of disruption

00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:45.100
that even people-- maybe people
in Hollywood are aware of--

00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:46.660
and I think a lot of people
who work there are not.

00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:48.576
They're like what we
were like in the magazine

00:30:48.576 --> 00:30:50.030
business in the late '90s.

00:30:50.030 --> 00:30:52.520
Well, this internet thing is
coming, but, you know, yeah.

00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:54.728
I mean, they've fought it
off for a long time, right.

00:30:54.728 --> 00:30:57.440
They really, really fought it
off and protected their model.

00:30:57.440 --> 00:31:01.020
But I do think that TV
business is going to change.

00:31:01.020 --> 00:31:03.470
And it's going to change
the same way ours was.

00:31:03.470 --> 00:31:06.080
A monopoly model that threw
off huge amounts of money

00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:08.000
becomes a model
that now throws off

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.290
1/10 of what it
used to generate,

00:31:10.290 --> 00:31:15.072
and then has to adjust to
a newer, lower cost base.

00:31:15.072 --> 00:31:16.530
CHRIS: So it's
funny because if you

00:31:16.530 --> 00:31:20.007
look at your work on "Silicon
Valley," what would you

00:31:20.007 --> 00:31:22.590
pull out of season one, season
two, season three, where you're

00:31:22.590 --> 00:31:24.487
like, I'm so glad I
got to tell that story

00:31:24.487 --> 00:31:25.570
but then they stopped you.

00:31:25.570 --> 00:31:29.420
And they said, if you keep
going and basically turn it

00:31:29.420 --> 00:31:31.370
into reportage,
people actually won't

00:31:31.370 --> 00:31:33.840
believe that this is happening
in the startup world.

00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:36.020
I mean, did you ever hit that?

00:31:36.020 --> 00:31:37.560
Because I know that when I was--

00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:39.530
DAN: Oh because you--
you should say that.

00:31:39.530 --> 00:31:40.050
Chris also--

00:31:40.050 --> 00:31:41.300
CHRIS: It's about you, though.

00:31:41.300 --> 00:31:44.111
DAN: No, no but you
consulted on the show, too.

00:31:44.111 --> 00:31:46.360
The one thing that I think
they've done that's really,

00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:48.090
really smart and really
cool, is they reached out

00:31:48.090 --> 00:31:49.680
to a lot of people
in the industry.

00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:51.350
And they actually--
they'll ask Chris,

00:31:51.350 --> 00:31:53.390
you know, come talk
to us about blank.

00:31:53.390 --> 00:31:54.160
And tell us this.

00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:54.900
And explain this.

00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:56.040
And how would this happen.

00:31:56.040 --> 00:31:58.630
If we had a situation
where the guy wants to do,

00:31:58.630 --> 00:32:01.860
this but then this happens would
that be at least plausible.

00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:03.292
And guys like you would say--

00:32:03.292 --> 00:32:04.000
CHRIS: Yeah-- no.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:05.790
DAN: Eh, maybe, kind
of, not so much.

00:32:05.790 --> 00:32:07.690
And so at least they know when
they're stretching reality

00:32:07.690 --> 00:32:08.520
or-- keep it real.

00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:09.390
No, but they--

00:32:09.390 --> 00:32:10.240
CHRIS: I mean, you
must have had things

00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:12.670
where you're like-- not even
about HubSpot but about some

00:32:12.670 --> 00:32:13.590
of the other things
you've covered.

00:32:13.590 --> 00:32:15.020
You would say, and
then this would happen,

00:32:15.020 --> 00:32:16.770
and they're like no
one's going to buy that.

00:32:16.770 --> 00:32:17.120
DAN: Yeah.

00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:18.495
Yeah, definitely
there are things

00:32:18.495 --> 00:32:21.080
that are so funny in reality
that are like-- yeah, if you

00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:23.330
put it into a show, people
would think it was made up.

00:32:23.330 --> 00:32:25.140
But there are lots of
elements of real stuff.

00:32:25.140 --> 00:32:25.780
CHRIS: Like the
teddy bear thing.

00:32:25.780 --> 00:32:26.760
You couldn't just bring that in.

00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:26.900
DAN: Yeah.

00:32:26.900 --> 00:32:28.150
CHRIS: People are like-- what?

00:32:28.150 --> 00:32:29.120
That's contrived.

00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:30.620
DAN: Yeah, that's
not going to work.

00:32:30.620 --> 00:32:33.482
Yeah, but in this
year's show there

00:32:33.482 --> 00:32:35.690
was a basically an ark where
they bring in an old guy

00:32:35.690 --> 00:32:36.880
to be the CEO.

00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:39.190
"An old guy."

00:32:39.190 --> 00:32:41.980
And his ideas are he
wants to go enterprise.

00:32:41.980 --> 00:32:43.480
He wants to put
everything in a box.

00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:45.680
And he wants to make
money real fast.

00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:48.790
And he explains to Richard
that the product we're making

00:32:48.790 --> 00:32:50.665
is not the product
you think it is.

00:32:50.665 --> 00:32:51.790
The product is the company.

00:32:51.790 --> 00:32:52.831
The product is our stock.

00:32:52.831 --> 00:32:55.370
And my job-- I'm brought
in here by the VCs.

00:32:55.370 --> 00:32:58.760
My job is to take your valuation
that now is at $50 million

00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:01.360
or $100 million, whatever it is,
and make it into $500 million

00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:02.420
by the end of this year.

00:33:02.420 --> 00:33:04.910
So whatever gets us to that.

00:33:04.910 --> 00:33:05.880
That's my product.

00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:09.000
My product is the company we're
going to sell or take public.

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:11.910
Whatever you're making in the
engineering department is fine.

00:33:11.910 --> 00:33:14.710
But that's not
really the product.

00:33:14.710 --> 00:33:17.599
And that was, I think, kind
of real but very cynical

00:33:17.599 --> 00:33:18.890
and that made it into the show.

00:33:18.890 --> 00:33:19.250
CHRIS: Yeah.

00:33:19.250 --> 00:33:20.390
DAN: But there were
other things that I

00:33:20.390 --> 00:33:22.260
think are-- I mean,
they've visited

00:33:22.260 --> 00:33:23.840
Google a bunch of times, right?

00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:23.910
Haven't they?

00:33:23.910 --> 00:33:25.660
CHRIS: That's how I
ended up meeting them.

00:33:25.660 --> 00:33:28.090
They came here and they met
a whole bunch of engineers.

00:33:28.090 --> 00:33:30.020
DAN: You guys have been really
good about having them in.

00:33:30.020 --> 00:33:31.440
Some companies--
early on companies

00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:32.481
didn't want to meet them.

00:33:32.481 --> 00:33:35.287
And then after season one,
everybody wanted to meet them.

00:33:35.287 --> 00:33:37.870
But then they were disappointed
because it's just the writers.

00:33:37.870 --> 00:33:39.510
The actors don't show up, right.

00:33:39.510 --> 00:33:41.780
And it's just like--
so the writers are not

00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:43.500
very interesting or
attractive people.

00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:43.890
CHRIS: What do you mean?

00:33:43.890 --> 00:33:44.940
They're all wonderful.

00:33:44.940 --> 00:33:46.030
DAN: No, no, really nice.

00:33:46.030 --> 00:33:47.560
But it's like
every-- people always

00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:49.976
say to me-- I get friends in
the industry who will call me

00:33:49.976 --> 00:33:53.330
like, hey, we want to
get TJ Miller to speak

00:33:53.330 --> 00:33:54.080
at our conference.

00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:55.010
I'm like, yeah,
of course you do.

00:33:55.010 --> 00:33:55.485
They want the actors.

00:33:55.485 --> 00:33:57.027
You know, everybody--
but the writers

00:33:57.027 --> 00:33:58.901
are just kind of-- you
know, you've met them.

00:33:58.901 --> 00:34:00.770
They're schlumpy guys,
who just come in--

00:34:00.770 --> 00:34:02.410
CHRIS: He's saying that,
they're actually very--

00:34:02.410 --> 00:34:03.460
DAN: Smart, funny guys.

00:34:03.460 --> 00:34:05.334
But they're not like--
they're not glamorous.

00:34:05.334 --> 00:34:07.550
CHRIS: They're-- they're
moderately attractive.

00:34:07.550 --> 00:34:08.190
DAN: No.

00:34:08.190 --> 00:34:10.148
I don't mean it to say
like they're not-- yeah,

00:34:10.148 --> 00:34:11.639
I mean, you know.

00:34:11.639 --> 00:34:12.179
Yeah.

00:34:12.179 --> 00:34:12.580
I mean--

00:34:12.580 --> 00:34:13.620
CHRIS: I mean, I'm not
going to say any names,

00:34:13.620 --> 00:34:14.870
but there are a couple of
very attractive writers.

00:34:14.870 --> 00:34:16.494
DAN: Mike Judge is
a very handsome man.

00:34:16.494 --> 00:34:17.820
Very good looking guy, right.

00:34:17.820 --> 00:34:18.650
CHRIS: Yes, he is.

00:34:18.650 --> 00:34:20.130
DAN: And everybody wants to
meet him because they all

00:34:20.130 --> 00:34:20.210
love "Beavis and Butthead."

00:34:20.210 --> 00:34:22.168
CHRIS: If I were into
fellas, I'd take him out.

00:34:22.168 --> 00:34:22.999
DAN: Yeah, right.

00:34:22.999 --> 00:34:24.040
I mean, yeah, same thing.

00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:26.020
Alec Berg, a very
good looking guy.

00:34:26.020 --> 00:34:29.840
But as you go down the
ladder, it gets-- no,

00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:32.099
but I just mean it's not--
I mean, they're just--

00:34:32.099 --> 00:34:33.760
they actually look a lot like--

00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:34.400
CHRIS: Nerds.

00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:35.690
DAN: Nerds, yeah,
and that's the thing.

00:34:35.690 --> 00:34:37.148
And they and they
really are nerds.

00:34:37.148 --> 00:34:39.690
The guys who write for that
show read all the tech blogs.

00:34:39.690 --> 00:34:43.090
And they're-- we have a--
I'm not working on the show

00:34:43.090 --> 00:34:43.590
anymore.

00:34:43.590 --> 00:34:46.860
But we had a slack room.

00:34:46.860 --> 00:34:48.424
So we'd all be trading links.

00:34:48.424 --> 00:34:50.590
And then we'd come in and
talk about this thing that

00:34:50.590 --> 00:34:52.506
had really happened and
how could we use that.

00:34:52.506 --> 00:34:54.466
But, yeah, no they're
really, really avidly--

00:34:54.466 --> 00:34:56.840
and some of them never paid
any attention to tech before.

00:34:56.840 --> 00:35:00.210
So it was kind of cool to see
them really now get into it.

00:35:00.210 --> 00:35:02.932
CHRIS: And the craft of comedy
writing as applied to the show.

00:35:02.932 --> 00:35:05.140
DAN: Yeah, but those guys
could turn around next year

00:35:05.140 --> 00:35:07.537
and go write a comedy that
was set on a hockey team

00:35:07.537 --> 00:35:09.370
and they'd go learn
everything about hockey.

00:35:09.370 --> 00:35:10.661
They're just really smart guys.

00:35:10.661 --> 00:35:14.140
But they really love the
field trips to Silicon Valley.

00:35:14.140 --> 00:35:16.792
One time they had a meeting
with-- I was with them

00:35:16.792 --> 00:35:19.250
but I didn't get to go because
only the big guys got to go.

00:35:19.250 --> 00:35:20.791
And I'm one of the
peons on the show.

00:35:20.791 --> 00:35:23.390
But the big guys got to have a
dinner with Reid Hoffman, Mark

00:35:23.390 --> 00:35:26.997
Pincus, and Drew Houston,
I think, from Dropbox.

00:35:26.997 --> 00:35:28.705
And they didn't know
who those guys were.

00:35:28.705 --> 00:35:30.330
But like, one of the
[? CO-EPs ?] went.

00:35:30.330 --> 00:35:31.610
He's a musician.

00:35:31.610 --> 00:35:31.930
CHRIS: I don't know
who these guys are.

00:35:31.930 --> 00:35:33.230
DAN: He was like-- he
was in punk rock bands.

00:35:33.230 --> 00:35:34.970
And like he's a great writer
but he doesn't know anything

00:35:34.970 --> 00:35:35.430
about tech.

00:35:35.430 --> 00:35:37.610
And the next day he said to
me-- yeah, you know these guys

00:35:37.610 --> 00:35:38.090
we met with?

00:35:38.090 --> 00:35:39.173
I was like, who were they.

00:35:39.173 --> 00:35:40.700
He tells me and
I'm like, no, dude,

00:35:40.700 --> 00:35:42.317
those are really big guys.

00:35:42.317 --> 00:35:44.650
He's like really, I don't
know, how much are they worth?

00:35:44.650 --> 00:35:48.820
I said, I don't know, like
together-- $5 billion.

00:35:48.820 --> 00:35:50.620
He's like what!

00:35:50.620 --> 00:35:52.750
Yeah, that one guy,
Reid Hoffman, he's

00:35:52.750 --> 00:35:54.950
a multibillionaire.

00:35:54.950 --> 00:35:56.117
Then he was like, oh my god!

00:35:56.117 --> 00:35:56.616
You know.

00:35:56.616 --> 00:35:58.640
Actually, one day we were
walking around Google

00:35:58.640 --> 00:35:59.960
with Matt Cutts.

00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:01.380
CHRIS: Yeah, sure.

00:36:01.380 --> 00:36:05.760
DAN: And one of the producer
guys who's not a writer,

00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:08.122
said to me-- so these people
all worth a lot of money?

00:36:08.122 --> 00:36:09.080
I'm like yeah, kind of.

00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:11.246
He's like how about this
guy who's giving us a tour?

00:36:11.246 --> 00:36:13.810
And I'm like oh, yeah,
he's loaded, Matt Cutts.

00:36:13.810 --> 00:36:17.232
And-- Jesus Christ!

00:36:17.232 --> 00:36:17.940
They all get mad.

00:36:17.940 --> 00:36:20.740
Because they think they're
like BSDs in Hollywood

00:36:20.740 --> 00:36:23.910
because they have $10 million.

00:36:23.910 --> 00:36:25.170
Like, yeah, sorry.

00:36:25.170 --> 00:36:28.381
You're at Google now, pal.

00:36:28.381 --> 00:36:29.880
And I think that's
part of the show.

00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:31.870
The schadenfreude-- not the
shcadenfreude-- the reverse.

00:36:31.870 --> 00:36:34.040
The jealousy that Hollywood
has of Silicon Valley.

00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:35.680
They're very jealous of it.

00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:37.513
CHRIS: It's funny, you
know, because there's

00:36:37.513 --> 00:36:40.460
this refrain that goes through
the coverage of Silicon Valley

00:36:40.460 --> 00:36:42.840
and Hollywood, and movie
streaming, and all the piracy

00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:43.740
stories.

00:36:43.740 --> 00:36:45.959
And they're like, Silicon
Valley hates Hollywood,

00:36:45.959 --> 00:36:47.250
Hollywood hates Silicon Valley.

00:36:47.250 --> 00:36:50.250
And I'm like, have you
seen how much these nerds

00:36:50.250 --> 00:36:51.540
like science fiction?

00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:53.790
I mean, do you have
any clue how much

00:36:53.790 --> 00:36:57.497
they love what comes out of
Los Angeles and Vancouver

00:36:57.497 --> 00:36:58.330
for science fiction?

00:36:58.330 --> 00:36:59.150
DAN: Yeah, yeah.

00:36:59.150 --> 00:37:03.500
CHRIS: And it's like, I
mean, there's an absurd love.

00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:05.182
It's almost like
a spurned lover.

00:37:05.182 --> 00:37:07.640
DAN: You mean the way Silicon
Valley feels about Hollywood.

00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:07.935
CHRIS: Both.

00:37:07.935 --> 00:37:08.330
DAN: Oh, both.

00:37:08.330 --> 00:37:08.730
CHRIS: Both ways.

00:37:08.730 --> 00:37:11.050
You know, in Hollywood,
they're like I can't believe

00:37:11.050 --> 00:37:13.195
that they're making money.

00:37:13.195 --> 00:37:15.320
DAN: Yeah, when I was
selling the "Fake Steve Show"

00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:16.460
and going around to
meetings and stuff

00:37:16.460 --> 00:37:18.800
that's what I kept picking
up at every network.

00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:20.990
To them it was like this
weird, strange world

00:37:20.990 --> 00:37:22.807
like the Googleplex was this--

00:37:22.807 --> 00:37:23.390
CHRIS: Alien--

00:37:23.390 --> 00:37:25.140
DAN: Fortress, and they
really wanted to visit it.

00:37:25.140 --> 00:37:27.050
But it was like
another planet to them.

00:37:27.050 --> 00:37:28.845
And they were fascinated by it.

00:37:28.845 --> 00:37:30.970
They could tell that there
was some strange culture

00:37:30.970 --> 00:37:32.094
there that they didn't get.

00:37:32.094 --> 00:37:34.430
And they thought it
would be worthwhile.

00:37:34.430 --> 00:37:37.409
And I think it's
suitable to comedy

00:37:37.409 --> 00:37:39.450
because they feel like
they're not punching down,

00:37:39.450 --> 00:37:40.360
they're punching up.

00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:42.610
You guys can take a joke
because at the end of the day

00:37:42.610 --> 00:37:44.427
you're laughing all
the way to the bank.

00:37:44.427 --> 00:37:45.760
So I think that's how they feel.

00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:47.570
You can make fun of-- you can
make up a character like Gavin

00:37:47.570 --> 00:37:48.986
Belson and make
fun of him because

00:37:48.986 --> 00:37:51.625
like at the end of
the day, you know,

00:37:51.625 --> 00:37:54.000
I don't think-- I don't think
Sergey really cares, right.

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:56.220
I don't think-- not that Gavin
Belson is based on Sergey.

00:37:56.220 --> 00:37:57.080
He's certainly not.

00:37:57.080 --> 00:37:58.120
He's more of a Larry Ellison.

00:37:58.120 --> 00:37:59.390
I always thought he was
more a Larry Ellison.

00:37:59.390 --> 00:38:00.400
CHRIS: Yeah, no, he's
very much Larry Ellison.

00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:00.890
DAN: Don't you think?

00:38:00.890 --> 00:38:01.920
Kind of Larry, yeah?

00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:04.309
CHRIS: Yeah, because
Larry has the weird--

00:38:04.309 --> 00:38:05.100
DAN: I never asked.

00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:05.630
I never asked.

00:38:05.630 --> 00:38:07.620
CHRIS: I don't need to be
called to the Oracle Trial.

00:38:07.620 --> 00:38:09.536
DAN: Because the guys
who created the show are

00:38:09.536 --> 00:38:10.770
no longer with the show.

00:38:10.770 --> 00:38:12.752
And they created-- the
main characters, Gavin

00:38:12.752 --> 00:38:14.210
and those guys,
all came from them.

00:38:14.210 --> 00:38:15.710
So I've never been
able to find out,

00:38:15.710 --> 00:38:18.700
who were you thinking of then
when you made that character.

00:38:18.700 --> 00:38:20.780
But I do think they feel
like it's fair game.

00:38:20.780 --> 00:38:21.810
You can make fun of it.

00:38:21.810 --> 00:38:24.277
And I've been amazed the way
Silicon Valley people actually

00:38:24.277 --> 00:38:24.860
like the show.

00:38:24.860 --> 00:38:26.817
And they all like the humor.

00:38:26.817 --> 00:38:29.400
Some of them say it's too much,
it's too close, it's too true.

00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:31.140
CHRIS: No, I love it when people
tell me this-- they're like,

00:38:31.140 --> 00:38:32.430
oh you worked on the show.

00:38:32.430 --> 00:38:34.630
You know, this part here
I couldn't watch it.

00:38:34.630 --> 00:38:35.760
I just had to stop.

00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:40.976
It was too painful to watch
that mirror up to my career.

00:38:40.976 --> 00:38:41.475
You know?

00:38:41.475 --> 00:38:42.974
And that just makes
me feel awesome.

00:38:42.974 --> 00:38:44.930
I'm like, yeah,
yeah, there you go.

00:38:44.930 --> 00:38:47.970
DAN: Yeah, or there was
a storyline in season 2

00:38:47.970 --> 00:38:49.667
where they had a
woman that got hired

00:38:49.667 --> 00:38:51.750
and then they wanted her
and Monica to be friends,

00:38:51.750 --> 00:38:53.240
because you're a woman
and you're a woman.

00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:54.650
And that came from a real story.

00:38:54.650 --> 00:38:56.760
We met a woman from
Dropbox who was

00:38:56.760 --> 00:38:58.340
really funny and super cool.

00:38:58.340 --> 00:38:59.990
But it was one of these things
where 10 people showed up

00:38:59.990 --> 00:39:00.770
for the meeting.

00:39:00.770 --> 00:39:01.980
And we all wanted
to talk to her,

00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:03.150
but everybody else kept talking.

00:39:03.150 --> 00:39:03.970
But she was like an engineer--

00:39:03.970 --> 00:39:04.610
CHRIS: She's not
just from Dropbox,

00:39:04.610 --> 00:39:06.100
she runs their engineer--
I mean, she was--

00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:07.220
DAN: Oh, do you
know who that is?

00:39:07.220 --> 00:39:08.550
CHRIS: Yeah, yeah, she's
a serious engineer.

00:39:08.550 --> 00:39:10.090
She came out of the
Python-- I'm sorry,

00:39:10.090 --> 00:39:10.900
I don't want to get all nerdy.

00:39:10.900 --> 00:39:11.800
DAN: Her company was
acquired and that's how

00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:12.610
she ended up at Dropbox, right?

00:39:12.610 --> 00:39:13.190
CHRIS: Yeah.

00:39:13.190 --> 00:39:14.830
DAN: So she had
these-- and she had

00:39:14.830 --> 00:39:17.360
worked at really teeny-tiny
startups like Pied Piper.

00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:18.610
So she had great stories.

00:39:18.610 --> 00:39:21.600
And one of them was-- they
said to-- I think it was her.

00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:23.200
I said-- maybe it
was someone else.

00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:24.340
It was, it might have
been a woman from Google.

00:39:24.340 --> 00:39:25.684
CHRIS: Colleen from Facebook.

00:39:25.684 --> 00:39:27.350
DAN: No, you know,
it was a Google woman

00:39:27.350 --> 00:39:30.430
who said look, the
worst thing-- I don't

00:39:30.430 --> 00:39:31.730
mind being the only woman.

00:39:31.730 --> 00:39:33.670
I've always been the
only woman, from the time

00:39:33.670 --> 00:39:34.840
I was a computer science major.

00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:35.590
CHRIS: [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:35.590 --> 00:39:39.530
DAN: We came here once for
a visit-- and every meeting

00:39:39.530 --> 00:39:40.670
was all women.

00:39:40.670 --> 00:39:42.929
And I was like, do any
men work here at Google?

00:39:42.929 --> 00:39:43.470
I don't know.

00:39:43.470 --> 00:39:45.400
It was like every meeting
was just full of women.

00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:47.220
And they were talking about
being a woman at Google.

00:39:47.220 --> 00:39:48.350
What it's like to be
a woman at Google.

00:39:48.350 --> 00:39:49.183
And a woman in tech.

00:39:49.183 --> 00:39:51.757
And a woman, there's a
woman-- There's a woman.

00:39:51.757 --> 00:39:53.340
There's an engineer
but she's a woman.

00:39:53.340 --> 00:39:53.500
CHRIS: There's a theme
to this conversation.

00:39:53.500 --> 00:39:54.570
DAN: She's a woman,
woman engineer.

00:39:54.570 --> 00:39:54.930
Yeah.

00:39:54.930 --> 00:39:55.930
So we got this message.

00:39:55.930 --> 00:39:58.610
OK, you want to
talk about women.

00:39:58.610 --> 00:40:00.860
But she was saying, I don't
mind being the only woman.

00:40:00.860 --> 00:40:03.069
The worst thing is when
the second woman joins

00:40:03.069 --> 00:40:05.610
and then they all look at you
and they want you to get along.

00:40:05.610 --> 00:40:07.390
But I don't have any reason
to get along with her just

00:40:07.390 --> 00:40:08.310
because we're both female.

00:40:08.310 --> 00:40:08.880
I don't care.

00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:10.629
I don't necessarily
want to be her friend.

00:40:10.629 --> 00:40:13.950
And that was like-- this
woman tossed this comment out

00:40:13.950 --> 00:40:14.620
as an aside.

00:40:14.620 --> 00:40:16.550
But they were like oh,
that's such a good storyline.

00:40:16.550 --> 00:40:17.530
CHRIS: Do you guys want
to share an office?

00:40:17.530 --> 00:40:19.470
Do you want to sit
next to each other?

00:40:19.470 --> 00:40:20.080
DAN: You should get together.

00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:21.380
You want to go out after work?

00:40:21.380 --> 00:40:22.830
That's like really--

00:40:22.830 --> 00:40:24.413
CHRIS: I bet you
have a lot in common.

00:40:24.413 --> 00:40:27.420
DAN: So that came out of a real
conversation with someone here.

00:40:27.420 --> 00:40:30.470
Yeah, but the woman from Dropbox
too Skyped in with us later.

00:40:30.470 --> 00:40:31.670
She was really good.

00:40:31.670 --> 00:40:33.852
Really, really-- I think
they should have put her

00:40:33.852 --> 00:40:34.810
in the show as a cameo.

00:40:34.810 --> 00:40:36.970
She was really,
really compelling.

00:40:36.970 --> 00:40:38.992
Very engaging.

00:40:38.992 --> 00:40:40.200
CHRIS: It's really something.

00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:43.690
But to bring it back to
the book, one of the things

00:40:43.690 --> 00:40:45.690
that-- one of the
outcomes-- so if you

00:40:45.690 --> 00:40:47.700
read the book, when you get to
the end, there's an epilogue.

00:40:47.700 --> 00:40:49.824
And I don't know if you're
a skip the epilogue kind

00:40:49.824 --> 00:40:51.040
of person, don't skip it.

00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:54.167
Because they went nonlinear.

00:40:54.167 --> 00:40:56.750
DAN: Yeah, we should've called
it just the next chapter rather

00:40:56.750 --> 00:40:57.220
than the epilogue.

00:40:57.220 --> 00:40:57.970
CHRIS: Yeah, yeah.

00:40:57.970 --> 00:40:59.610
DAN: After the book--
after I delivered

00:40:59.610 --> 00:41:02.220
a rough draft of the
book, they announced

00:41:02.220 --> 00:41:03.952
that they had fired the CMO.

00:41:03.952 --> 00:41:05.410
They were going to
fire another guy

00:41:05.410 --> 00:41:06.784
but he resigned
before he could--

00:41:06.784 --> 00:41:10.406
my boss, my former
boss-- and the CEO,

00:41:10.406 --> 00:41:12.780
for doing something to try to
get hold of the manuscript.

00:41:12.780 --> 00:41:15.610
And then-- and they turned
it over to law enforcement.

00:41:15.610 --> 00:41:16.799
So I was like, what the f--

00:41:16.799 --> 00:41:19.340
CHRIS: Like, Computer Fraud and
Abuse Act type investigation.

00:41:19.340 --> 00:41:20.300
DAN: Yeah, like, Cyber Crimes.

00:41:20.300 --> 00:41:22.549
So I end up having to get
interviewed by the FBI Cyber

00:41:22.549 --> 00:41:23.150
Crimes guys.

00:41:23.150 --> 00:41:25.407
And I'm like-- but they
won't tell me what happened.

00:41:25.407 --> 00:41:26.490
I had a victim specialist.

00:41:26.490 --> 00:41:29.650
When you're in one of these,
you get a little letter saying,

00:41:29.650 --> 00:41:30.860
you have a victim specialist.

00:41:30.860 --> 00:41:31.943
Here's your victim number.

00:41:31.943 --> 00:41:33.330
I have a victim number.

00:41:33.330 --> 00:41:34.100
Seriously.

00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:36.990
Call in and use your victim
identification number.

00:41:36.990 --> 00:41:38.530
CHRIS: It's probably more
secure than your social security

00:41:38.530 --> 00:41:38.770
number.

00:41:38.770 --> 00:41:39.110
DAN: Yeah.

00:41:39.110 --> 00:41:40.900
But when you call-- well,
that's been compromised.

00:41:40.900 --> 00:41:41.509
That's gone.

00:41:41.509 --> 00:41:42.550
Everything's in the wind.

00:41:42.550 --> 00:41:44.160
My social security
number is gone.

00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:46.400
But-- yeah, so
they did something.

00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:47.942
And the FBI investigated.

00:41:47.942 --> 00:41:49.400
My victim specialist
won't tell me.

00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:50.520
The FBI won't tell me.

00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:53.200
So then I did a FOIA request,
a Freedom of Information Act

00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:53.920
request.

00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:55.629
And, unfortunately,
the book went to bed

00:41:55.629 --> 00:41:57.170
and we couldn't get
this in the book.

00:41:57.170 --> 00:42:00.477
But afterwards what came out
was that it was also extortion.

00:42:00.477 --> 00:42:02.310
So somebody there came
up with this scheme--

00:42:02.310 --> 00:42:05.330
we'll hack into his computer,
or maybe use my old company

00:42:05.330 --> 00:42:07.370
laptop, and we'll
read his e-mail.

00:42:07.370 --> 00:42:08.340
We'll get the book.

00:42:08.340 --> 00:42:09.715
And then we'll
try to dig up dirt

00:42:09.715 --> 00:42:12.340
on either me or the
publisher or somebody,

00:42:12.340 --> 00:42:14.940
and it was an extortion scheme
to try to kill the book.

00:42:14.940 --> 00:42:17.730
Which is like-- the
Rupert Pupkin of crime,

00:42:17.730 --> 00:42:20.770
just like the most insane
criminal mastermind

00:42:20.770 --> 00:42:21.590
plan of all time.

00:42:21.590 --> 00:42:23.796
And they totally got caught.

00:42:23.796 --> 00:42:26.170
So it was like the world's
worst-- world's worst hackers.

00:42:26.170 --> 00:42:27.210
CHRIS: Did Molly not help them?

00:42:27.210 --> 00:42:28.830
DAN: And until then--
right when this happened

00:42:28.830 --> 00:42:29.510
I was starting to feel bad.

00:42:29.510 --> 00:42:31.100
Because I wrote this
book and I was like-- ah,

00:42:31.100 --> 00:42:33.180
I'm kind of making these
guys look like doofuses.

00:42:33.180 --> 00:42:33.930
Maybe that's not--

00:42:33.930 --> 00:42:34.490
CHRIS: Yeah, you don't
want to be mean or cruel.

00:42:34.490 --> 00:42:35.912
DAN: Maybe that's unkind.

00:42:35.912 --> 00:42:37.870
And then this happened
and I was like OK, fine.

00:42:37.870 --> 00:42:39.630
Yeah, yeah.

00:42:39.630 --> 00:42:41.450
Assholes.

00:42:41.450 --> 00:42:44.930
But it was like-- seriously like
the world's worst criminals.

00:42:44.930 --> 00:42:46.760
Like just-- so yeah.

00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:47.700
So I still don't know.

00:42:47.700 --> 00:42:51.110
So I got these redacted
documents from the FBI.

00:42:51.110 --> 00:42:53.176
But you can't-- and some
of them you can fill in.

00:42:53.176 --> 00:42:54.300
And there's more documents.

00:42:54.300 --> 00:42:55.860
But the rest of them
I'm still trying to get.

00:42:55.860 --> 00:42:57.690
I'm still trying to get
hold of them from the U.S.

00:42:57.690 --> 00:42:58.440
Attorney's office.

00:42:58.440 --> 00:43:01.840
So I don't know what's
behind-- probably not much.

00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:03.769
But it was-- it was a
funny twist on the book.

00:43:03.769 --> 00:43:05.310
Which is-- the book
started out to be

00:43:05.310 --> 00:43:07.730
just a funny book
about being an old guy

00:43:07.730 --> 00:43:10.137
and trying to deal with
kooky corporate culture.

00:43:10.137 --> 00:43:11.345
And then has this dark twist.

00:43:11.345 --> 00:43:13.240
And I tell you, it's weird
getting hacked and finding out

00:43:13.240 --> 00:43:13.650
you've been hacked.

00:43:13.650 --> 00:43:14.360
CHRIS: Oh, I know it's terrible.

00:43:14.360 --> 00:43:16.530
DAN: I realized if you really
wanted to mess with somebody,

00:43:16.530 --> 00:43:17.700
you don't even
have to hack them.

00:43:17.700 --> 00:43:20.490
You just have to make them think
that maybe they've been hacked.

00:43:20.490 --> 00:43:21.726
But you won't tell them what.

00:43:21.726 --> 00:43:23.600
So you have to assume
that everything you own

00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:24.516
is in the wind, right.

00:43:24.516 --> 00:43:27.140
Like every-- your bank accounts,
everything's out there.

00:43:27.140 --> 00:43:28.230
Kids' pictures, right.

00:43:28.230 --> 00:43:29.910
So-- and that messes
with your head.

00:43:29.910 --> 00:43:31.120
It makes you really paranoid.

00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:34.730
And I was already fairly
paranoid before that.

00:43:34.730 --> 00:43:35.660
It's just my tendency.

00:43:35.660 --> 00:43:38.216
CHRIS: I mean, did you get
many-- during the Fake Steve

00:43:38.216 --> 00:43:39.590
Jobs days and your
"Forbes" days,

00:43:39.590 --> 00:43:42.970
I mean, I remember-- I
used to do a publication

00:43:42.970 --> 00:43:45.434
and it attracted death
threats for a while.

00:43:45.434 --> 00:43:46.100
DAN: Oh, really.

00:43:46.100 --> 00:43:47.690
CHRIS: And so I learned really
early on in the late 90's--

00:43:47.690 --> 00:43:48.850
DAN: That was open
source, right?

00:43:48.850 --> 00:43:50.150
CHRIS: No, I used to work
for the State Department.

00:43:50.150 --> 00:43:51.720
I published something called
"The Patterns of Global

00:43:51.720 --> 00:43:53.975
Terrorism," and this was
before terrorism was cool.

00:43:53.975 --> 00:43:55.050
DAN: Jesus-- really?

00:43:55.050 --> 00:43:57.030
CHRIS: And so I would
get these death threats.

00:43:57.030 --> 00:43:57.530
DAN: Oh.

00:43:57.530 --> 00:44:01.310
CHRIS: So you learn early
on, if you're lucky,

00:44:01.310 --> 00:44:03.989
how to manage your persona.

00:44:03.989 --> 00:44:05.280
So we have about a minute left.

00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:07.860
But I mean, did they
it ever get that dire.

00:44:07.860 --> 00:44:11.851
DAN: No, no, I mean, I
had like-- who's that guy.

00:44:11.851 --> 00:44:13.777
Oh, John Gruber at
Daring Fireball, he

00:44:13.777 --> 00:44:15.860
used to write a lot of bad
stuff on his Apple blog

00:44:15.860 --> 00:44:16.776
about me being a jerk.

00:44:16.776 --> 00:44:19.200
And Paul Carr at PandoDaily
for whatever reason,

00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:21.112
I don't know why, just hates me.

00:44:21.112 --> 00:44:23.320
And so for a while it just
was like-- yeah, no, but--

00:44:23.320 --> 00:44:25.300
CHRIS: And, I mean, you
know Pando's leadership

00:44:25.300 --> 00:44:28.180
has been under this kind of
ridiculous, silly threats.

00:44:28.180 --> 00:44:28.680
You know?

00:44:28.680 --> 00:44:29.000
I mean--

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:30.125
DAN: Yeah, oh that's right.

00:44:30.125 --> 00:44:31.960
Because they had the Uber thing.

00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:32.991
And that was a big deal.

00:44:32.991 --> 00:44:34.740
I actually thought
about hiring bodyguards

00:44:34.740 --> 00:44:35.600
when my thing happened.

00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:37.641
I wanted to go get bodyguards
and show up on CNBC

00:44:37.641 --> 00:44:38.857
with like-- [INAUDIBLE] did.

00:44:38.857 --> 00:44:41.190
But then-- go everywhere with
two guys with ear buds in.

00:44:41.190 --> 00:44:42.450
Like, OK, all
right-- it's clear.

00:44:42.450 --> 00:44:43.050
But--

00:44:43.050 --> 00:44:45.260
CHRIS: We have a
51/40 over in upper--

00:44:45.260 --> 00:44:46.761
DAN: Yeah, but no, no.

00:44:46.761 --> 00:44:48.010
I never had any death threats.

00:44:48.010 --> 00:44:51.200
I mean, even now-- I
mean, the, you know.

00:44:51.200 --> 00:44:52.670
The book's just a funny book.

00:44:52.670 --> 00:44:53.120
CHRIS: It's delightful.

00:44:53.120 --> 00:44:55.411
DAN: Yeah, there's no reason
to kill me, I don't think.

00:44:58.090 --> 00:44:59.590
Just want to put
that on the record.

00:44:59.590 --> 00:45:01.700
CHRIS: So that's a great
place to wrap up, I think.

00:45:01.700 --> 00:45:02.380
DAN: Yeah, I'm going
to wrap up with that.

00:45:02.380 --> 00:45:03.490
There is no reason to kill me.

00:45:03.490 --> 00:45:03.990
Thank you.

00:45:03.990 --> 00:45:06.250
CHRIS: Yeah, so thank
you so much for coming.

00:45:06.250 --> 00:45:07.040
DAN: Thank you for having me.

00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:08.070
CHRIS: To the conference
and talking to us.

00:45:08.070 --> 00:45:09.370
DAN: I'm happy to answer
any questions later.

00:45:09.370 --> 00:45:09.660
But yeah.

00:45:09.660 --> 00:45:10.210
CHRIS: Yeah, yeah.

00:45:10.210 --> 00:45:11.668
We can go-- find
us walking around.

00:45:13.952 --> 00:45:14.899
DAN: Oh, the gopher.

00:45:14.899 --> 00:45:15.940
CHRIS: I can get you one.

00:45:15.940 --> 00:45:15.991
DAN: Oh, OK.

00:45:15.991 --> 00:45:16.290
OK, thank you.

00:45:16.290 --> 00:45:16.790
OK.

00:45:18.390 --> 00:45:21.740
