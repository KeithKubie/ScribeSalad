00:00:00.931 --> 00:00:02.162
- [Voiceover] Hey grammarians, hey Paige.

00:00:02.162 --> 00:00:02.995
- [Voiceover] Hi David.

00:00:02.995 --> 00:00:04.345
- [Voiceover] So we're gonna talk today

00:00:04.345 --> 00:00:08.176
about the Oxford comma, which
is just another word for

00:00:08.176 --> 00:00:11.218
another name for the serial
comma which is normally when you

00:00:11.218 --> 00:00:13.772
have a list of things, you punctuate them

00:00:13.772 --> 00:00:16.048
with a comma after each item.

00:00:16.048 --> 00:00:17.719
So for example, in this sentence:

00:00:17.719 --> 00:00:19.512
I'd like to thank my parents, comma,

00:00:19.512 --> 00:00:22.530
Mahatma Gandhi, comma, and my pet hamster.

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:26.222
Or in this example: His favorite
artists are Elvis, comma,

00:00:26.222 --> 00:00:29.868
a tiny Norwegian harpist,
comma, and Frida Kahlo.

00:00:29.868 --> 00:00:32.118
Now this is a pretty big...

00:00:33.258 --> 00:00:38.258
controversy in English is
where to put this comma.

00:00:38.258 --> 00:00:42.016
Some style guides for example
the AP style guide recommends

00:00:42.016 --> 00:00:45.266
that you don't include this last comma.

00:00:46.567 --> 00:00:48.193
The style guide that Khan Academy uses,

00:00:48.193 --> 00:00:52.094
the Chicago Manual of
Style, does recommend it.

00:00:52.094 --> 00:00:55.205
Ultimately this is less about
grammar and more about style,

00:00:55.205 --> 00:00:58.131
less about sense and more about taste.

00:00:58.131 --> 00:01:00.685
'Cause you can make, I think,
a pretty convincing argument

00:01:00.685 --> 00:01:04.075
against each one, like whether
to use the Oxford comma

00:01:04.075 --> 00:01:07.489
or whether to not use the Oxford comma.

00:01:07.489 --> 00:01:08.322
Paige, could you take me through

00:01:08.322 --> 00:01:12.179
the possible ambiguity
in this first sentence?

00:01:12.179 --> 00:01:14.292
- [Voiceover] Sure, so
this sentence without

00:01:14.292 --> 00:01:17.055
the Oxford comma can kind
of look like you're saying

00:01:17.055 --> 00:01:19.391
that you're parents are Mahatma Gandhi

00:01:19.391 --> 00:01:22.038
and your pet hamster,
which is pretty crazy.

00:01:22.038 --> 00:01:25.475
- [Voiceover] Right, and
the second one is a sort

00:01:25.475 --> 00:01:27.402
of sentence that could be used

00:01:27.402 --> 00:01:30.583
to make the argument
against the Oxford comma.

00:01:30.583 --> 00:01:32.835
So his favorite artists are Elvis,

00:01:32.835 --> 00:01:35.529
a tiny Norwegian harpist, and Frida Kahlo,

00:01:35.529 --> 00:01:38.557
and it could be argued that
you're saying that Elvis,

00:01:38.557 --> 00:01:42.736
the rock-n-roll progenitor, hip-swivel guy

00:01:42.736 --> 00:01:46.736
was a tiny Norwegian
harpist, which is not true.

00:01:48.007 --> 00:01:50.528
Both of these things are kind of examples

00:01:50.528 --> 00:01:54.445
of assumed apposition that we're using.

00:01:55.404 --> 00:01:58.051
We're using Mahatma
Gandhi and my pet hamster

00:01:58.051 --> 00:02:01.186
to explain or clarify parents.

00:02:01.186 --> 00:02:03.415
Or that we're using a
tiny Norwegian harpist

00:02:03.415 --> 00:02:05.737
to explain or clarify Elvis.

00:02:05.737 --> 00:02:07.820
And this is not the case.

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:12.100
I think you have to choose which kind

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.100
of confusion is more
important for you to avoid.

00:02:17.371 --> 00:02:19.414
Frankly, the way to fix
these sentences is to put

00:02:19.414 --> 00:02:22.990
the uncertain thing
elsewhere in the sentence.

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.706
So probably last, like I'd like to think.

00:02:25.706 --> 00:02:29.189
Mahatma Gandhi, my pet
hamster and my parents.

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:31.535
And there's no confusion no matter

00:02:31.535 --> 00:02:33.276
where you put the comma there.

00:02:33.276 --> 00:02:36.759
Or his favorite artists
are Elvis, Frida Kahlo,

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:38.756
and a tiny Norwegian harpist.

00:02:38.756 --> 00:02:39.708
- [Voiceover] Yeah, that does a good job

00:02:39.708 --> 00:02:42.495
of avoiding that confusion.

00:02:42.495 --> 00:02:46.326
- [Voiceover] A good craftsman
never blames their tools.

00:02:46.326 --> 00:02:47.998
That's all I gotta say about that.

00:02:47.998 --> 00:02:49.716
So Paige and I are here to report.

00:02:49.716 --> 00:02:51.945
We're not here to make law.

00:02:51.945 --> 00:02:53.640
We're trying to tell
you about the language

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.614
as it is and the way people use it.

00:02:55.614 --> 00:02:58.888
Well we do at Khan Academy
is we use the Oxford comma,

00:02:58.888 --> 00:03:01.233
so parents, comma, Mahatma Gandhi, comma,

00:03:01.233 --> 00:03:03.555
and my pet hamster, or Elvis, comma,

00:03:03.555 --> 00:03:06.875
a tiny Norwegian harpist,
comma, and Frida Kahlo.

00:03:06.875 --> 00:03:07.708
- [Voiceover] Yeah.

00:03:07.708 --> 00:03:08.541
- [Voiceover] You have to find

00:03:08.541 --> 00:03:09.546
a style guide and stick with it.

00:03:09.546 --> 00:03:13.354
And sometimes that depends
on if you're writing

00:03:13.354 --> 00:03:16.605
for a newspaper that uses
a particular style guide,

00:03:16.605 --> 00:03:19.368
or if your English teacher
has a particular style guide

00:03:19.368 --> 00:03:20.482
that they want you to abide by,

00:03:20.482 --> 00:03:22.665
that's what you should follow.

00:03:22.665 --> 00:03:23.498
- [Voiceover] Exactly.

00:03:23.498 --> 00:03:25.080
Different people will
tell you different things.

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.054
- [Voiceover] The key is to be consistent.

00:03:27.054 --> 00:03:28.052
That's the Oxford comma.

00:03:28.052 --> 00:03:29.979
That's the debate over it.

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:32.650
And it's really all about a false sense

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.596
of these being appositives.

00:03:35.596 --> 00:03:38.087
So keep a wary eye out.

00:03:38.087 --> 00:03:39.249
That's the Oxford comma.

00:03:39.249 --> 00:03:40.549
You can learn anything.

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:41.382
David out.

00:03:41.382 --> 00:03:42.466
- [Voiceover] Paige out.
