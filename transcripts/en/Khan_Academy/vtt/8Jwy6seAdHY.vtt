00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.240
We are on problem 12.

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:04.890
I had to take a pause because I
had a hunger pang, but I had

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.160
to resist. Because I do this
thing called the Warrior Diet,

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.525
which is more of a
way of life-- but

00:00:09.525 --> 00:00:10.775
anyway, back to the SAT.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.380
But you shouldn't starve
yourself because you have to

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:20.240
feed your brain for the SAT.

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:21.580
OK, let me draw the
x- and y-axis.

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.740
Whenever I'm hungry, I just go
outside and do some sprints

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:32.990
because that's the
warrior way.

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:36.410
That's the y-axis.

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:37.500
But you shouldn't do
that because you're

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.220
probably still growing.

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.100
I, unfortunately, have
stabilized at 5'9".

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.490
All right, so let's see, they
drew something that looks like

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:52.750
a parabola, so I'm going to
assume it is without better

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:53.320
information.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.290
So let me draw it.

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.500
My thing does not look like
a parabola, but I

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:00.690
think you get the point.

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.220
And then they draw this
rectangle-looking thing.

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:05.470
I'll draw it in another color.

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.390
Something like that.

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.870
Let's see, let me label
these points.

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:30.680
Points q, r, s, this is t.

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.850
And they say that this
is-- oh, p, p not t.

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.930
And this is point
negative 1, 0.

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.700
So obviously the y is 0 because
we're on the x-axis

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:42.950
and that's negative
1 and that's 1.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.720
They tell us in the figure
above p, q, r, s is a

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.110
rectangle and points q and r lie
on the graph of y equals

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:52.360
ax squared.

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:57.430
And that's this thing,
this yellow thing.

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:58.970
Where a is a constant.

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.636
If the perimeter of pqrs is 10,
what is the value of a?

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.410
If we can figure out one ordered
pair, if we can figure

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.800
out one x-y pair that lie on
this curve, we can figure out

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.690
what the curve is because we
can substitute that y and x

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.770
into this equation
and solve for a.

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:20.660
Well, do we know any points
that are on that?

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.440
Well, both r and q are on it,
so if we can figure out the

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.420
coordinates of r and q,
then we will be set.

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:28.270
So what can we do?

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:29.450
Well, they told us
a perimeter.

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.170
They told us the perimeter
of this rectangle.

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.640
So what do we know about
the rectangle already?

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.240
How long is this side
right here?

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.660
Well, it goes 1 unit to the left
on the x-axis and it goes

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.870
1 to the right and it's flat.

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.640
So that has a width
of 2, right?

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.500
It's a rectangle, so if that
has a width of 2, this also

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.300
has a width of 2, right?

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.830
Let's call this height.

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:55.060
That's the height of
the rectangle.

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.960
If that's the height, that's
also the height.

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.290
So what's the perimeter?

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:07.670
The perimeter is 2 plus 2, which
is 4, plus h plus h.

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:08.780
And that equals what?

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.110
They told us that equals 10.

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:12.450
So we can add those
h's together.

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.350
We get 4 plus 2h
is equal to 10.

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.310
Or subtract 4 from both sides.

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.190
2h is equal to 6.

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:22.800
Divide both sides by 2.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.430
h is equal to 3.

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.360
So we know that h equals 3.

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.840
So if h equals 3, what
is the point r?

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.830
Well we know that its
x-coordinate is 1 out, so it's

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:38.020
1, and then what's
the y-coordinate?

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:40.430
Well, this height right
here is 3, right?

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:42.530
And we're starting at 0,
so we go 3 up from 0.

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:45.490
So this is going to
be 3 right here.

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:48.940
So the r's coordinate is 1, 3.

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:54.070
And r is on the yellow parabola,
so now we are set.

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:57.780
We can take this and substitute
x and y here.

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:03.920
We know y is equal to 3
when x is equal to 1.

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.440
So 1 squared, right?
x squared.

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.630
So 3 is equal to a times
1 squared is 1.

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:14.030
So a is equal to 3 because
that one doesn't matter,

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:16.260
right? a is equal to
3 so we just write

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:17.709
down 3 inside there.

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:18.959
Next problem.

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.290
Problem 13.

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:40.650
If a times b plus b is equal
to a plus 2c, what is the

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:50.880
value of b when a is equal
to 2 and c is equal to 3?

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:55.270
So a real quick thing that we
can do just to maybe simplify

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:58.600
things for us is we can factor
out the b out of this side.

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.420
What do I mean by factoring
out a b?

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:04.630
Well, divide both of these terms
by b and you get b times

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:09.410
a plus 1 is equal
to a plus 2c.

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:11.710
All right, let me box this out
so you don't get confused.

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:14.290
All I did is I undistribute
the b, right?

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:16.450
You can multiply this back
out and you'd get

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:18.610
ab is equal to b.

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:21.340
And then if you want to solve
for b, divide both sides by a

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:28.680
plus 1 and you get b is equal
to a plus 2c over a plus 1.

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.010
And then you substitute.

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:38.100
So a is 2, so it's 2 plus 2
times c, c is 3, 2 times 3

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:45.790
over 2 plus 1, which is equal
to 2 plus 6 over 3, which is

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:46.340
equal to what?

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:48.330
8/3.

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:50.200
Another way you could have done
it-- and it might have

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:51.610
been even faster, actually--
is just to

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:53.150
substitute from the beginning.

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:59.650
So you say a is 2, so that would
give us 2b plus b right?

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:06.650
I just, a is 2 is equal to 2
plus 2 times c, 2 plus 6.

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:09.790
So you get 2b plus b,
so what's 2b plus b?

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:11.160
That's 3b.

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:14.200
3b is equal to 2 plus 6, 8.

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:15.950
Actually this would
have been faster.

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:18.220
8 divided by 3.

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:19.940
So those are two ways you
could have done it, and

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:22.460
hopefully you'll do them
one of the two ways.

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:24.190
Hopefully you'll do
it the faster way.

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:25.440
Next problem.

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:30.020
14.

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:33.690
Bunch of lines for me to draw.

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:35.230
I do so much for you guys.

00:06:38.366 --> 00:06:41.630
The only thing I get in return
is the satisfaction of you

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:42.980
guys getting a perfect
score on the SAT.

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:48.170
I'm going to take these videos
down before I have kids,

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:50.460
though, so they don't
have competition.

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:52.070
Let's see, OK.

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:53.632
I'm kidding.

00:06:53.632 --> 00:06:55.610
The competition will only
make them stronger.

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:58.682
I don't have kids yet, by the
way, but one day I will.

00:06:58.682 --> 00:07:03.800
And they'll have to compete
against you guys, who I've

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:06.200
given this edge to.

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:08.130
That's how selfless I am.

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:10.090
And anyway, back
to the problem.

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:15.720
So we have this-- I'm only
partially serious.

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:29.840
OK, this is l, this
is a, b, c.

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:32.670
This is angle y, y degrees.

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:37.750
This out here is angle
x, x degrees.

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:41.630
In the figure above, m is
parallel to n, so this is m,

00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:44.540
this is n, they are parallel.

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:46.000
Fair enough?

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.700
And l bisects angle abc.

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:55.320
So what does bisect mean?

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:59.190
That means that it splits the
angle perfectly, so that tells

00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:03.840
us that angle is equivalent
to this angle.

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:04.650
OK?

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:13.580
If y is between 45 and
55, what is one

00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:16.590
possible value for x?

00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:22.420
So let's just say that y is 50
and see what we can do here.

00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:26.940
So if y is 50, right?

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:31.320
That satisfies, this is
between 45 and 55.

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:33.214
What is this larger angle
here that I'm

00:08:33.214 --> 00:08:36.039
going to do in magenta?

00:08:36.039 --> 00:08:37.750
Well, it's a corresponding
angle, right?

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:41.230
Because it's a parallel line,
k is a transversal, so this

00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:43.010
magenta angle corresponds
to y.

00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:45.750
So it will also be
equal to 50.

00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:50.990
And we know l bisects this
angle, so both of these

00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:55.640
smaller angles are going
to be 25 and 25.

00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:58.500
And now l is a transversal
as well.

00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:02.400
So if l is 25, this angle
right here is 25.

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:05.360
Let me do that in
another color.

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:07.040
No, that color was
too similar.

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:08.500
I'll do it in red.

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:12.900
If this right here is 25, what
angle is this going to be?

00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:16.203
Well once again, corresponding
angles of a transversal, so

00:09:16.203 --> 00:09:18.180
this is also going to be 25.

00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:20.370
And now what could x be?

00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:23.320
Well, x is opposite to this
angle, so it's also going to

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:25.300
be 25 degrees.

00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:29.250
So this is just the angle
game on steroids.

00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:30.970
And you really didn't have to do
the range, you just pick a

00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:33.980
number. y is 50, corresponding
angle is also 50.

00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:37.740
That corresponding angle is
bisected, so each of these

00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:38.950
smaller angles is 25.

00:09:38.950 --> 00:09:42.540
And then l is a transversal
again, so if this is 25, this

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:44.420
is 25, and x is opposite.

00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:46.560
So it's also 25.

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:48.460
I'll see you in the
next video.
