00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:04.330
You can create more interesting
movement by animating multiple objects,

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:08.380
or even the children of an item
as the parent itself moves.

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:12.170
In this example, the cards move
onto screen at different speeds,

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:15.330
helping to convey that
they are separate items.

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.960
When doing this, it's key that you do so
in a coordinated matter, here

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:25.200
we are achieving coordinated motion by
using a consistent direction and timing.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.530
All cards move in from the bottom of
the screen, from different distances,

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:32.110
which causes the closing up effect.

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.140
Because they use the same duration and
interpolator, the acceleration and

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.550
deceleration will link
them perceptively,

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.200
thanks to the gestalt laws of
grouping that we looked at earlier.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.190
When moving multiple
items at the same time,

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.280
be mindful to choreograph their
paths in a cohesive direction.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.460
In this exaggerated example, each card
arrives from a different direction,

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.080
appearing chaotic.

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:59.000
Try sketching out the paths that items
will travel upon to check that they

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.710
are coordinated, avoiding overlapping
paths in conflicting directions.

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.090
In the real world,
few items move in a linear fashion, so

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.750
using linear motion can feel robotic and
unnatural.

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.020
In this example clicking on an item
performs a shared element transition

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:16.330
on the circle.

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.240
Notice that the difference between
this straight line transition and

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.130
curved transition.

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.370
The latter feels more natural.

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:27.600
Be judicious with this technique
as it can attract attention, so

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.090
make sure it's used when
that is your intention.

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.720
As we've seen, material surfaces
can transform their size,

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.870
shape, and position.

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:41.760
We've also seen how an items elevation
shows hierarchy and importance.

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.260
When animating a change
in size of an item,

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.990
you want to avoid having
your users mistake this for

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.970
a zoom effect, which might imply
an elevation change, like this example.

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.650
A good way to do this,
is to animate the width, and

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:59.340
the height at different rates,
making it clear what is changing.

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.600
Check the instructor's notes for

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.350
the source of these examples
to see how they are achieved.
