00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.620
Thinking of your phone as an extension of yourself isn’t crazy.

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:08.400
To say that your phone knows more about you than you know about you isn’t an exaggeration

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:10.020
It's a statement of fact.

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:13.880
Do you remember your location every minute of every day?

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:19.120
Do you remember what you said to your friend last leap day at 10:47 word-for-word?  Yeah,  of course not.

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.640
Hell, without photos, entire holidays would slide out of your mind.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.600
While paperwork that tracks us has existed since papyrus

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.560
Without people feeling like those hieroglyphs were literally an extension of the human mind

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.100
A phone can hold the equivalent of millions of papyrus pages.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.160
At some point a difference of amount becomes a difference of kind.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.620
Since you bought it, how many hours has your phone been more than an arm's reach away?

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.860
Possibly zero.  There's no other object like that in your life.

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.240
Given the choice to have someone read your mind or read your phone,

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.460
If you seriously think about it, you’d probably pick the former.

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:59.160
Compared to what's in your phone your brain holds a tiny amount of information, much of it wrong, all of it lossy.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.180
It's easy to forget what kind of embarrassment your phone contains,

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.500
Because it has so much you can't even remember

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.460
As you discover when someone flips through a bunch of photos you thought were safe

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.300
But suddenly discover aren't.

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.760
And while the phone now is an extension of the self: we all know where this is going.

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:21.580
A computer chip in your skull will eventually be as quasi-mandatory as a phone is today

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.820
And avoiding one will make you seem Amish.

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:29.340
If we don't protect our most intimate digital devices as part of the self, legally,

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.560
We're going to be in some scary places in the future.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:39.400
Because the law is a complicated brick structure of individuals laws each resting on what came before.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.360
This is why you hear lawyers argue based on laws from three hundred years ago:

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.380
That's not by insanity but by design.

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.420
And it’s why people freak out over court cases that lay down a new brick in a new area --

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:57.160
It's not about this brick.  It's about what will, inevitably, be built on top of it.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:04.440
To argue, "Don't worry, this law is just for this case, this time." is to argue against what the law is.

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.760
Like a chess player saying to his opponent, ‘This move isn’t about future moves’.

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:11.460
That's not how this works. That's not how any of this works.

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.500
Three hundred years ago someone writes a law about papers in your house

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.000
At a time when papers and books were luxury items and half the population, illiterate

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.840
And then it's applied to millions of intangible files on your phone

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.620
Which, in aggregate, record every detail of your life.

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:30.720
Maybe you think that's good. Maybe you don't. But either way, the modern law is built atop the old.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.900
And it's why people are right to be concerned about each precedent-setting law

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.740
And why 'slippery-slope fallacy' does not apply here.

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:44.440
Thinking about today's law is thinking about future law and access to your phone today

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.500
Is, unavoidably, about access to your mind tomorrow.
