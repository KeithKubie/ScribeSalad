00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:02.159
The Coming Banana Apocalypse

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.789
For starters, nearly all commercial banana
plants are perfect clones of one another and

00:00:06.789 --> 00:00:09.590
most originate from one single plant from
Southeast Asia.

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:14.400
Now to be clear, there are approximately 1000
different types of banana plants in the world

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.619
today and within each variety most are generally
clones of one another, although some do have

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.189
a bit of genetic diversification.

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:26.460
But “the” banana, since the 1960s, the
one sold commercially in supermarkets the

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:32.870
world over, is the Cavendish banana, named
after William Cavendish, the 6th Duke of Devonshire.

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:38.450
Most types of bananas originate from hybrids
of the Musa acuminata and Musa balbisiana.

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:42.610
When these two cross breed, the result is
a half breed banana plant that is almost completely

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:43.610
sterile.

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.940
The first records of these half breed banana
plants being cultivated dates back around

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.260
10,000-15,000 years ago, making it one of
the oldest known cultivated plants.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.580
Because this mutant plant was unable to breed
on its own, agriculturists had to find another

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:59.390
way to propagate the plants.

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.740
There are a few different ways to do so, but
the most popular is to simply take a shoot,

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:07.770
called a “sucker”, off an existing plant
and plant it elsewhere.

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.630
Even if the sucker has no roots, if placed
in the correct type of soil (wet sandy soil),

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.310
it will develop them in time.

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.940
The banana plant was gradually developed into
varieties we see today and propagated throughout

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.700
the world initially by Arab traders and later
Spanish conquistadors.

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.409
So a hybrid plant that normally would have
died off quite quickly has been spared by

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:31.970
human intervention, with humans’ simply
taking shoots from desirable existing plants

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.140
and spreading them throughout the world.

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.440
The advantages to this is that among each
variety, they are nearly all perfect clones

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:43.560
of one another, which means as a commercial
product, a Cavendish banana from some Cavendish

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.810
banana plant in Africa will taste and look
the same as one from South America.

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.159
There is one huge drawback however.

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.299
Because they are clones, what will kill one,
will kill them all, which has come into play

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.880
before in the commercial banana world.

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.410
The Banana Apocalypse
The Cavendish banana was not the world’s

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:03.030
most popular banana until the 1960s.

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.700
In fact, it was relatively unknown among the
masses and even after the 1960s the former

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.760
world’s most popular banana, the Gros Michel
or “Big Mike”, was generally preferred

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.620
by businesses and consumers alike.

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.730
The Gros Michel was preferred by businesses
due to being easier to ship and they stored

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.290
longer before spoiling than the Cavendish.

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.480
Consumers also liked them better for the increase
in storage time as well as the fact that they

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.690
are larger and sweeter and generally considered
to taste better.

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.310
The latter being one of the reasons it was
the world’s most popular banana in the first

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:33.310
place.

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.230
Unfortunately, the world was forced, very
suddenly, to switch bananas in the middle

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.060
of the 20th century.

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.040
So what happened to force this switch?

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.610
What happened was a banana apocalypse on a
global scale.

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:49.819
You see, as mentioned, the drawback of the
fact that within each variety of banana nearly

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:54.590
all the bananas are clones of one another
is what will kill or harm one banana plant

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.879
will do the same to all other banana plants
of the same variety.

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:04.040
Enter the Panama disease which caused the
near extinction of the Gros Michel Banana.

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.560
Panama disease is a type of fungus that lives
in the soil and to which fungicides do not

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.520
work against, which is why it is such a threat.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.350
There are a variety of strains of this fungus
out there, one of which wiped out the Gros

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.350
Michel Banana as a commercial product.

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:21.500
It was around the 1920s when this particular
strain of the Panama disease first showed

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.099
up in Sirname.

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:26.690
From there, it spread quickly through the
Caribbean and eventually throughout the banana

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:27.780
growing world.

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.140
By the 1960s, due to the mass wipe-out of
the Gros Michel, banana growers were pretty

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.800
much all nearly bankrupt and were desperately
trying to find a way to stay afloat.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:41.550
Enter the Cavendish banana, which is smaller,
but somewhat similar tasting to the Gros Michel,

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:45.310
only less sweet and more care needed in its
shipping and storage.

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.330
But just as important as the similar taste
was that it was resistant to the particular

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.690
strain of the Panama disease that wiped out
the Gros Michel.

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:57.470
A few billion dollars in infrastructure change
later and growers successfully made the switch,

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:01.550
with the mass public accepting the new banana
in place of the Gros Michel.

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:05.380
Unfortunately, a new strain of the Panama
disease, that the Cavendish banana is not

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:11.330
resistant to, sprung up in 1992 and threatens
the world’s most popular banana once again.

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:14.970
This time however, there has not yet been
found a similar substitute banana among the

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.669
other 1000 or so varieties out there.

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:22.389
Most varieties of banana contain giant hard
seeds throughout the soft fleshy inside and

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:25.640
generally taste nothing like the bananas we
are used to eating.

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:30.410
A second banana apocalypse, if it happens
soon before a new variety can either be genetically

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:35.690
engineered or carefully bred, will likely
see the end of the fruit as a popular commercial

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:36.690
product.

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:40.690
Since this new strain of Panama disease has
showed up, it has already wiped out plantations

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:45.699
in Indonesia, Malaysia, Australia, and Taiwan
and is currently spreading through Southeast

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:46.699
Asia.

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:50.290
It is also thought that it is only a matter
of time before it spreads through Africa and

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:54.800
Latin America, which would be the death knell
for the Cavendish as a commercial product.

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:59.090
Because of this, extremely strict cultivation
rules and regulations are in place to try

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:02.470
and protect the commercial plantations from
becoming infected.

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:07.240
Some experts even say this should be sufficient
to stop the commercial extinction of the Cavendish

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:08.460
banana from ever happening.

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:13.260
But others feel this is naive as similar efforts
were put forth to try and protect the Gros

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.250
Michel before its eventual commercial extinction.

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:20.930
Although, we do have the benefit of better
technology today to aid in protecting the

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:21.930
plantations.

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:26.419
However, even with this, it may be only a
matter of time before Cavendish bananas will

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:29.170
no longer be available in stores.

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:33.810
Bonus Facts:
• Bananas do not grow on trees.

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:37.979
Rather, they grow from a root structure that
produces an above ground stem.

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:42.509
The plant is specifically classified as an
arborescent (tree-like) perennial herb; in

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:47.110
fact, it is the largest herbaceous flowering
plant.

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:50.960
• Just as interesting as the banana plant
being an herb is that the banana itself is

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:53.990
a berry.

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:58.509
• One of the few other somewhat accepted
varieties of banana is the Goldfinger banana,

00:05:58.509 --> 00:06:02.460
which doesn’t taste like the Cavendish or
Gros Michel at all, rather tastes a bit like

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:03.460
an apple.

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:07.070
This variety was a hybrid bred banana created
by Philip Rowe.

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:13.400
It did not catch on commercially in most of
the world, excepting parts of Australia.

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:17.810
• Although no longer viable for mass cultivation,
the Gros Michel still grows in certain areas

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:21.930
of the world that has not been touched by
the particular strain of Panama disease that

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:24.020
wiped it out as a commercial product.

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:28.580
For similar reasons, the Cavendish is not
likely to ever be completely wiped out, though

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:32.410
it is thought it will eventually go the way
of the Gros Michel and eventually no longer

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:46.330
be commercially available.
