00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.200
You know what I hate?

00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:04.100
I am Daenerys Stormborn.

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.752
The unburnt mother of dragons,

00:00:06.752 --> 00:00:08.633
breaker of chains.

00:00:08.633 --> 00:00:11.433
Any character you love to watch on this show

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:12.344
and I..

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:14.579
(sharp inhale)

00:00:14.579 --> 00:00:16.259
No!

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:17.520
NO!

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:18.980
Who could have seen this coming...

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.660
NOOOOOOOOOO!!!!

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:23.854
Even more than that,

00:00:23.854 --> 00:00:25.575
I hate when someone says,

00:00:25.575 --> 00:00:27.371
"Hey, I wanted to tell you...

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:29.240
nevermind."

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.800
What?

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.360
Oh nevermind, it's nothing.

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:32.560
It's not nothing!

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:33.952
You can't just start to tell me something

00:00:33.952 --> 00:00:34.920
and then change your mind

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.680
because that's all I can think about!

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.760
But it always ends up being like this:

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:39.636
No, seriously, tell me.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:40.832
No, seriously, it's nothing.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.207
So then tell me.

00:00:42.354 --> 00:00:44.734
You have to tell me because now I need to know, okay?

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:46.740
Because the mystery part of it is killing me.

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:47.540
Whoa, okay,

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.878
I was just gonna say that we should do laundry today,

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.355
but then I remember that we did it yesterday.

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.240
It's always nothing!

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.500
When has someone ever said, "oh, never mind."

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.760
and it's turned out to be really important?

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:59.780
Never.

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.640
Yet I persist as if my life depends on it.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:03.560
Never mind.

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.372
Dude, just tell me.

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:06.144
Well...

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:08.200
Out with it already.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.260
I think it's kinda too late.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.280
Dude, you know every time you say "oh 
nevermind" it's all I can think about,

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.900
So freaking tell--

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:13.440
(gunshot)

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.046
Or, like whatever they say is going to be some giant secret.

00:01:18.046 --> 00:01:19.070
Oh, nevermind.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.795
What is it?

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.106
(sighs) Okay, um,

00:01:22.106 --> 00:01:25.697
I'm CIA, FBI, NSA, CDC.

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.265
Quadruple agent 0.

00:01:27.265 --> 00:01:28.896
And we want to recruit you.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:30.953
All of us.

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:31.540
(sighs)

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:32.580
I knew it.

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.080
I'm so glad I insisted you tell me.

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.720
Oh my god, I know right?

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:37.390
I'm like, super excited to work together.

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:37.970
Supes excite.

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:39.610
But it could backfire on me.

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:41.730
I mean, how many times has this happened?

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:42.258
Nevermind.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:43.540
No, what was it? Tell me.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.060
I murdered someone.

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.100
(dramatic music)

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.160
Oh, man..

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.880
why'd you tell me that?

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:49.620
You insisted.

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.503
Yeah, but you could have gotten through 
the whole part of the conversation

00:01:51.503 --> 00:01:53.363
where it's like, "Oh, nothing, don't worry about it"

00:01:53.363 --> 00:01:54.366
maybe I would have given up.

00:01:54.366 --> 00:01:55.606
Yeah, but...

00:01:55.606 --> 00:01:56.883
no one ever gives up.

00:01:56.883 --> 00:01:58.630
You know? So I just felt like I would save you the time

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:59.890
and just come out with it already.

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.444
Well, that's nice.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.916
I do appreciate you thinking about my time.

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:06.723
Oh, one second, I just have to make a quick call.

00:02:06.723 --> 00:02:07.580
(cell phone beeps)

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:09.231
Hi,

00:02:09.231 --> 00:02:11.531
yeah, my friend's a murderer.

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:12.480
(softly) Sorry...

00:02:12.487 --> 00:02:14.045
(softly) It's okay...

00:02:14.045 --> 00:02:15.345
Yeah, I know, come get her..

00:02:15.345 --> 00:02:16.125
What about you?

00:02:16.125 --> 00:02:17.531
When someone says, "Oh, nevermind"

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.660
are you able to just like let it go and drop your fucks,

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:20.565
or are you like me,

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:21.509
and paranoid,

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:24.349
and you have to know what they were gonna say?

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.489
Do I overreact?

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:28.208
(crying)

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.058
NO!!!! THAT WAS MY FAVORITE CHARACTER TO WATCH!!

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.420
NOOOOOOOOOOOOO

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:36.380
I'm Anna Akana.

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:37.695
Stay awesome, Gotham.

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.960

Currently, I'm listening to Game of 
Thrones: A Song of Fire and Ice,

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.466
