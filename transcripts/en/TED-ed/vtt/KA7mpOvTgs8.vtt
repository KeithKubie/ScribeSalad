00:00:07.136 --> 00:00:09.033
English, like all languages,

00:00:09.033 --> 00:00:10.573
is a messy business.

00:00:10.573 --> 00:00:13.283
You can be uncouth but not couth.

00:00:13.283 --> 00:00:14.720
You can be ruthless,

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:16.333
but good luck trying to show somebody

00:00:16.333 --> 00:00:17.414
that you have ruth

00:00:17.414 --> 00:00:18.950
unless you happen to be married

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:20.691
to someone named Ruth.

00:00:20.691 --> 00:00:22.154
It's bad to be unkempt

00:00:22.154 --> 00:00:23.999
but impossible to be kempt,

00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:27.305
or sheveled as opposed to disheveled.

00:00:27.305 --> 00:00:27.996
There are other things

00:00:27.996 --> 00:00:29.561
that make no more sense than those

00:00:29.561 --> 00:00:30.864
but that seem normal now

00:00:30.864 --> 00:00:32.446
because the sands of time

00:00:32.446 --> 00:00:34.443
have buried where they came from.

00:00:34.443 --> 00:00:36.144
For example, did you ever wonder

00:00:36.144 --> 00:00:39.275
why a nickname for Edward is Ned?

00:00:39.275 --> 00:00:40.645
Where'd the N come from?

00:00:40.645 --> 00:00:43.248
It's the same with Nellie for Ellen.

00:00:43.248 --> 00:00:45.280
Afterall, if someone's name is Ethan,

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.401
we don't nickname him Nethan,

00:00:47.401 --> 00:00:50.578
nor do we call our favorite Maria, Nmaria.

00:00:50.578 --> 00:00:51.904
In fact, if anyone did,

00:00:51.904 --> 00:00:54.275
our primary urge would be to either scold them

00:00:54.275 --> 00:00:55.752
or gently hide them away

00:00:55.752 --> 00:00:57.773
until the company had departed.

00:00:57.773 --> 00:01:01.362
All these nicknames trace back to a mistake,

00:01:01.362 --> 00:01:04.116
although, a perfectly understandable one.

00:01:04.116 --> 00:01:06.928
In fact, even the word nickname is weird.

00:01:06.928 --> 00:01:09.384
What's so "nick" about a nickname?

00:01:09.384 --> 00:01:11.801
Is it that it's a name that has a nick in it?

00:01:11.801 --> 00:01:13.557
Let's face it, not likely.

00:01:13.557 --> 00:01:16.279
Actually, in Old English, the word was ekename,

00:01:16.279 --> 00:01:19.163
and eke meant also or other.

00:01:19.163 --> 00:01:21.211
You can see eke still used

00:01:21.211 --> 00:01:23.837
in Chaucer's &lt;em&gt;Canterbury Tales&lt;/em&gt; in a sentence like,

00:01:23.837 --> 00:01:26.749
"Whan Zephyrus eek with his sweete breeth,"

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:27.671
which meant,

00:01:27.671 --> 00:01:30.169
"When Zephyr also with his sweet breath."

00:01:30.169 --> 00:01:33.569
Ekename meant "also name."

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:37.112
What happened was that when people said, "an ekename,"

00:01:37.112 --> 00:01:38.668
it could sound like they were saying,

00:01:38.668 --> 00:01:40.687
"a nekename,"

00:01:40.687 --> 00:01:41.742
and after a while,

00:01:41.742 --> 00:01:43.618
so many people were hearing it that way

00:01:43.618 --> 00:01:44.941
that they started saying,

00:01:44.941 --> 00:01:46.288
"That's my nickname,"

00:01:46.288 --> 00:01:49.744
instead of, "That's my ekename."

00:01:49.744 --> 00:01:51.778
Now, the word had a stray n at the front

00:01:51.778 --> 00:01:53.183
that started as a mistake,

00:01:53.183 --> 00:01:56.360
but from now on was what the word really was.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:57.987
It was rather as if you had gum

00:01:57.987 --> 00:01:59.542
on the bottom of your shoe

00:01:59.542 --> 00:02:00.738
and stepped on a leaf,

00:02:00.738 --> 00:02:02.743
dragged that leaf along for the rest of your life,

00:02:02.743 --> 00:02:04.175
were buried wearing that shoe

00:02:04.175 --> 00:02:05.327
and went to heaven in it

00:02:05.327 --> 00:02:08.631
to spend eternity wedded to that stray, worn-out leaf.

00:02:08.631 --> 00:02:12.060
Ekename picked up an n and never let it go.

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.769
The same thing happened with other words.

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:17.406
Old English speakers cut otches into wood.

00:02:17.406 --> 00:02:18.933
But after centuries of being asked

00:02:18.933 --> 00:02:21.824
to cut an otch into something,

00:02:21.824 --> 00:02:25.615
it was easy to think you were cutting a notch instead,

00:02:25.615 --> 00:02:27.410
and pretty soon you were.

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.284
In a world where almost no one could read,

00:02:29.284 --> 00:02:31.194
it was easier for what people heard

00:02:31.194 --> 00:02:32.695
to become, after awhile,

00:02:32.695 --> 00:02:34.827
what it started to actually be.

00:02:34.827 --> 00:02:37.368
Here's where the Ned-style nicknames come in.

00:02:37.368 --> 00:02:39.490
Old English was more like German

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:41.206
than our English is now,

00:02:41.206 --> 00:02:43.910
and just as in German, my is mein,

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.161
in Old English, my was meen.

00:02:47.161 --> 00:02:48.596
You would say meen book,

00:02:48.596 --> 00:02:50.570
actually boke in Old English,

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.100
or meen cat.

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.591
And just as today,

00:02:53.591 --> 00:02:55.243
we might refer to our child

00:02:55.243 --> 00:02:56.424
as my Dahlia

00:02:56.424 --> 00:02:57.894
or my Laura,

00:02:57.894 --> 00:03:00.577
in Old English, they would say, "Meen Ed".

00:03:00.577 --> 00:03:02.474
That is mein Ed,

00:03:02.474 --> 00:03:04.339
mein Ellie.

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:06.081
You see where this is going.

00:03:06.081 --> 00:03:08.545
As time passed, meen morphed

00:03:08.545 --> 00:03:10.924
into the my we know today.

00:03:10.924 --> 00:03:14.066
That meant that when people said, "Mein Ed,"

00:03:14.066 --> 00:03:17.331
it sounded like they were saying my Ned.

00:03:17.331 --> 00:03:19.194
That is, it sounded like whenever someone

00:03:19.194 --> 00:03:21.009
referred to Edward affectionately,

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:23.778
they said Ned instead of Ed.

00:03:23.778 --> 00:03:26.180
Behold, the birth of a nickname!

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.580
Or an ekename.

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.236
Hence, also Nellie for Ellen

00:03:31.236 --> 00:03:32.567
and Nan for Ann,

00:03:32.567 --> 00:03:34.817
and even in the old days, Nabby for Abigal.

00:03:34.817 --> 00:03:39.033
President John Adam's wife Abigail's nickname was Nabby.

00:03:39.786 --> 00:03:41.585
All sorts of words are like this.

00:03:41.585 --> 00:03:44.735
Old English speakers wore naprons,

00:03:44.735 --> 00:03:48.839
but a napron sounds like an apron,

00:03:48.839 --> 00:03:50.758
and that gave birth to a word apron

00:03:50.758 --> 00:03:53.333
that no one in Beowulf would have recognized.

00:03:53.333 --> 00:03:56.380
Umpire started as numpires, too.

00:03:56.933 --> 00:03:58.939
If all of this sounds like something sloppy

00:03:58.939 --> 00:04:00.930
that we modern people would never do,

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.817
then think about something you hear all the time

00:04:02.817 --> 00:04:04.197
and probably say,

00:04:04.197 --> 00:04:06.184
"A whole nother."

00:04:06.184 --> 00:04:07.737
What's nother?

00:04:07.737 --> 00:04:10.317
We have the word another, of course,

00:04:10.317 --> 00:04:13.604
but it's composed of an and other,

00:04:13.604 --> 00:04:14.612
or so we thought.

00:04:14.612 --> 00:04:17.445
Yet, when we slide whole into the middle,

00:04:17.445 --> 00:04:19.397
we don't say, "a whole other,"

00:04:19.397 --> 00:04:22.311
we clip that n off of the an

00:04:22.311 --> 00:04:23.455
and stick it to other

00:04:23.455 --> 00:04:26.403
and create a new word, nother.

00:04:26.403 --> 00:04:28.444
For a long time, nobody was writing

00:04:28.444 --> 00:04:29.746
these sort of things down

00:04:29.746 --> 00:04:31.374
or putting them in a dictionary,

00:04:31.374 --> 00:04:32.708
but that's only because writing

00:04:32.708 --> 00:04:35.749
is more codified now than it was 1,000 years ago.

00:04:35.749 --> 00:04:37.346
So, when you see a weird word,

00:04:37.346 --> 00:04:38.861
remember that there might be

00:04:38.861 --> 00:04:41.263
a whole nother side to the story.
