00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.500
Monogamy, or being in a relationship with one person, is actually very uncommon among mammals.

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.360
With only about 3% displaying monogamous bonding.

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.840
So what's the deal with humans?

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.800
Is it really better to be with one person for your entire life?

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.900
Historically humans did not practice monogamy.

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.200
The anthropological record indicates that tens of thousands of years ago

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:25.340
approximately 85% of human societies were composed of men with more than one partner

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:30.380
The reason why most of the world has shifted to socially imposed monogamy is debated among scientists,

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.960
but a leading hypothesis is to minimize the risk of sexually transmitted infection.

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.680
As human societies transitioned from small hunter gatherer societies

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.040
to larger densely populated agricultural societies,

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:47.000
models show the shift in lifestyle would allow STI's to proliferate causing death and infertility.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.180
But, while monogamy may have evolved to prevent STI's, what about now?

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.520
Many maintain they are in a monogamous relationship, but are actually committing infidelity.

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:00.820
Estimates of cheating among married Americans range from 21%-57% among men,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.860
and 11%-35% among women.

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.080
In fact, a study of college students in exclusive relationships

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.560
found that 1 in 5 admit to using tinder on the side,

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:16.980
and those who identify as monogamous are less likely to practice safer sex including condom use and STI testing.

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:21.460
As they fear introducing these practices into a relationship may create suspicion.

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:28.060
However, those in consensual non-monogamous relationships are more likely to use condoms for both vaginal and anal intercourse,

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:33.340
be screened regularly for STI's, and discuss external sexual encounters with their primary partner.

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:39.840
So,  now it seems those in consensually non-monogamous relationships may be at a lower risk for STI's than monogamous.

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.280
A study using 1,500 individuals in monogamous partnerships

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.380
and 617 individuals in consensual non-monogamous relationships

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:53.560
found no significant differences on relationship function, overall satisfaction, commitment, and passionate love.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.600
In fact, jealously was lower and trust was higher in individuals who were not monogamous.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.080
Skeptical of these results?

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.960
You're not alone.

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:05.380
A study had participants read a brief description of hypothetical research results

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.560
which read: In general polyamorous couples had more positive outcomes than monogamous couples.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.860
Participants would rate this statement as unfairly biased.

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.240
Where as if the exact same statement was switched to favor monogamous relationships

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.140
it would be rated as less biased.

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.600
These results help show how we're primed to think that monogamous relationships

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.780
are more loving, committed, and satisfying.

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:31.960
While consensual non-monogamous relationships like swinging, polyamory, and open relationships are often viewed negatively.

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:35.220
This doesn't mean that you and your boo should just open things up though.

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.840
Monogamy may work great for some, but not others.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.160
One study found that men and women who wanted to engage in casual sex

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.760
were more likely to have higher levels of testosterone,

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.160
but this group may still be in the minority.

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.800
In a self- reported study of ideal mating arrangements

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:54.540
it was found that both men and women overwhelmingly prefer strictly monogamous mating arrangements when asked to choose

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.260
So, whether you prefer to keep your relationship to one person or to multiple

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:03.020
research is finding there are many ways to have a committed, satisfying, and loving relationship,

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.440
and monogamy is not the sole gold standard.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.980
Thank you so much for watching.

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:12.600
If you haven't seen it yet we just released another brand new video about what happens when millennials try to be environmentalists.

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:13.840
It's a new style of video.

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.020
We were trying to make science fun and cool, so make sure you watch it and share it.

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:18.120
We would really appreciate it.

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.800
So you can click the fancy link over there or we'll put a link in the description.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:22.840
So make sure you subscribe.

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.840
There'll be a new animated video next thursday.

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.840
And yeah, peace out. See ya.
