00:00:00.414 --> 00:00:03.023
- [Voiceover] We're told that
the tangent line to the graph

00:00:03.023 --> 00:00:05.822
of function at the the
point two comma three

00:00:05.822 --> 00:00:09.372
passes through the point seven comma six.

00:00:09.372 --> 00:00:11.039
Find f prime of two.

00:00:12.752 --> 00:00:14.642
So whenever you see something like this,

00:00:14.642 --> 00:00:16.250
it doesn't hurt to try to visualize it.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:17.883
You might want to draw it
out or just visualize it

00:00:17.883 --> 00:00:18.877
in your head

00:00:18.877 --> 00:00:21.459
but since you can't get in my head,

00:00:21.459 --> 00:00:23.297
I will draw it out.

00:00:23.297 --> 00:00:24.659
So let me

00:00:24.659 --> 00:00:27.616
draw the information
that they are giving us.

00:00:27.616 --> 00:00:30.809
So that's x axis and that is the y axis.

00:00:30.809 --> 00:00:33.166
Let's see the relevant points
here at two comma three

00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:35.108
and seven comma six.

00:00:35.108 --> 00:00:36.687
So let me go,

00:00:36.687 --> 00:00:38.520
one, two, three, four,

00:00:39.915 --> 00:00:42.998
five, six, seven, along the x axis

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:47.829
and I'm going to go one, two, three, four,

00:00:49.486 --> 00:00:52.153
five, and six, along the y axis.

00:00:53.607 --> 00:00:54.845
And now this point,

00:00:54.845 --> 00:00:57.782
so we have the point two comma three,

00:00:57.782 --> 00:01:00.066
so let me mark that,

00:01:00.066 --> 00:01:03.316
so two comma three is right over there,

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.239
so that's two comma three and we also have

00:01:08.239 --> 00:01:10.406
the point seven comma six.

00:01:11.424 --> 00:01:15.424
Seven comma six is going
to be right over there.

00:01:18.054 --> 00:01:20.070
Seven comma six.

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.498
Let us remind ourselves
what they're saying.

00:01:21.498 --> 00:01:24.735
They're saying the tangent
line to the graph of function f

00:01:24.735 --> 00:01:26.285
at this point

00:01:26.285 --> 00:01:29.141
passes through the point seven comma six.

00:01:29.141 --> 00:01:31.370
So if it's the tangent line
to the graph at that point,

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:33.368
it must go through two comma three,

00:01:33.368 --> 00:01:36.474
that's the only place where
it intersects our graph

00:01:36.474 --> 00:01:38.117
and it goes through seven comma six.

00:01:38.117 --> 00:01:40.271
We only need two points to define a line

00:01:40.271 --> 00:01:43.813
and so the tangent line
is going to look like,

00:01:43.813 --> 00:01:44.927
it's going to look like,

00:01:44.927 --> 00:01:46.469
let me see if I can,

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:47.897
no that's not right.

00:01:47.897 --> 00:01:49.031
Let me draw it

00:01:49.031 --> 00:01:51.039
like it's going to look.

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:52.813
Oh that's not exactly right.

00:01:52.813 --> 00:01:54.734
Let me try one more time.

00:01:54.734 --> 00:01:56.029
Okay, there you go.

00:01:56.029 --> 00:01:59.363
So the tangent line is
going to look like that.

00:01:59.363 --> 00:02:02.472
It goes, it's tangent two
f right at two comma three

00:02:02.472 --> 00:02:05.779
and it goes through the
point seven comma six

00:02:05.779 --> 00:02:07.928
and so we don't know anything other than f

00:02:07.928 --> 00:02:10.410
but we can imagine what f looks like.

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.949
Our function f could,

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:14.342
so our function f,

00:02:14.342 --> 00:02:15.863
it could look something like this.

00:02:15.863 --> 00:02:17.981
It just has to be tangent

00:02:17.981 --> 00:02:20.181
so that line has to be
tangent to our function

00:02:20.181 --> 00:02:21.730
right at that point.

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.137
So our function f could
look something like that.

00:02:26.137 --> 00:02:29.125
So when they say, find f prime of two,

00:02:29.125 --> 00:02:30.143
they're really saying,

00:02:30.143 --> 00:02:31.441
what is the slope of the

00:02:31.441 --> 00:02:34.950
tangent line when x is equal to two?

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.397
So when x is equal to two,

00:02:37.397 --> 00:02:38.951
well the slope of the tangent line

00:02:38.951 --> 00:02:40.468
is the slope of this line.

00:02:40.468 --> 00:02:43.433
They gave us, they gave
us the two points that sit

00:02:43.433 --> 00:02:44.899
on the tangent line.

00:02:44.899 --> 00:02:47.197
So we just have to figure out its slope

00:02:47.197 --> 00:02:50.120
because that is going to
be the rate of change of

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.146
that function right over there,

00:02:51.146 --> 00:02:51.979
its derivative.

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:53.926
It's going to be the
slope of the tangent line

00:02:53.926 --> 00:02:55.275
because this is the tangent line.

00:02:55.275 --> 00:02:56.108
So let's do that.

00:02:56.108 --> 00:02:57.212
So as we know,

00:02:57.212 --> 00:03:00.070
slope is change in y over change in x.

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.492
So if we change our,

00:03:02.492 --> 00:03:06.030
to go from two comma
three to seven comma six,

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.363
our change in x,

00:03:08.212 --> 00:03:09.717
change in x,

00:03:09.717 --> 00:03:12.168
we go from x equals two to x equals 7

00:03:12.168 --> 00:03:14.280
so our change in x is equal to five.

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.947
And our change in y,

00:03:17.238 --> 00:03:18.913
our change in y,

00:03:18.913 --> 00:03:22.740
we go from y equals three to y equals six.

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:25.847
So our change in y is equal to three.

00:03:25.847 --> 00:03:28.764
So our change in y over change in x

00:03:29.814 --> 00:03:32.523
is going to be three over five

00:03:32.523 --> 00:03:34.961
which is the slope of this line,

00:03:34.961 --> 00:03:38.830
which is the derivative
of the function at two

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:42.828
because this is the tangent
line at x equals two.

00:03:42.828 --> 00:03:45.328
Let's do another one of these.

00:03:46.705 --> 00:03:48.827
For a function g,

00:03:48.827 --> 00:03:52.746
we are given that g of
negative one equals three

00:03:52.746 --> 00:03:57.682
and g prime of negative one
is equal to negative two.

00:03:57.682 --> 00:04:01.084
What is the equation of the
tangent line to the graph of g

00:04:01.084 --> 00:04:03.511
at x equals negative one?

00:04:03.511 --> 00:04:04.845
Alright, so once again

00:04:04.845 --> 00:04:08.722
I think it will be helpful to graph this.

00:04:08.722 --> 00:04:10.298
So

00:04:10.298 --> 00:04:11.881
we have our y axis,

00:04:13.087 --> 00:04:14.837
we have our x axis

00:04:17.452 --> 00:04:18.597
and let's see.

00:04:18.597 --> 00:04:21.880
We say for function g we are
given that g of negative one

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.222
is equal to three.

00:04:23.222 --> 00:04:26.941
So the point negative one
comma three is on our function.

00:04:26.941 --> 00:04:30.066
So this is negative one and then we have,

00:04:30.066 --> 00:04:31.357
one,

00:04:31.357 --> 00:04:32.629
two,

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:34.137
and three.

00:04:34.137 --> 00:04:36.749
So that's that right over there.

00:04:36.749 --> 00:04:38.374
That is the point.

00:04:38.374 --> 00:04:40.680
That is the point
negative one comma three,

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.255
it's going to be on our function.

00:04:42.255 --> 00:04:44.690
And we also know that
g prime of negative one

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:46.307
is equal to negative two.

00:04:46.307 --> 00:04:48.338
So the slope of the tangent line

00:04:48.338 --> 00:04:50.240
right at that point on our function

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:51.342
is going to be negative two.

00:04:51.342 --> 00:04:52.342
That's what that tells us.

00:04:52.342 --> 00:04:53.715
The slope of the tangent line,

00:04:53.715 --> 00:04:57.420
when x is equal to negative
one is equal to negative two.

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:59.385
So I could use that information

00:04:59.385 --> 00:05:01.866
to actually draw the tangent line.

00:05:01.866 --> 00:05:04.125
So let me see if I can,

00:05:04.125 --> 00:05:06.482
let me see if I can do this.

00:05:06.482 --> 00:05:08.437
So it will look,

00:05:08.437 --> 00:05:10.020
so I think it will,

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:12.688
let me just draw it like this.

00:05:12.688 --> 00:05:14.753
So it's going to go,

00:05:14.753 --> 00:05:17.326
so it's a slope of negative two

00:05:17.326 --> 00:05:20.409
is going to look something like that.

00:05:22.268 --> 00:05:26.435
So as we can see if we move
positive one in the x direction,

00:05:27.613 --> 00:05:29.141
we go

00:05:29.141 --> 00:05:31.688
down two in the y direction.

00:05:31.688 --> 00:05:34.277
So that is a slope of negative two.

00:05:34.277 --> 00:05:37.726
And so you might say well, where is g?

00:05:37.726 --> 00:05:39.865
Well we could draw what g could look like.

00:05:39.865 --> 00:05:42.899
G might look something like this.

00:05:42.899 --> 00:05:46.816
Might look something like
that right over there

00:05:48.196 --> 00:05:51.362
where that is the tangent line

00:05:51.362 --> 00:05:54.281
or you can make g do all sorts
of crazy things after that

00:05:54.281 --> 00:05:56.550
but all we really care about is equation

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:58.217
for this green line.

00:05:59.149 --> 00:06:02.685
And there's a couple of
ways that you could do this.

00:06:02.685 --> 00:06:05.179
You could say, well look
a line is generally,

00:06:05.179 --> 00:06:07.735
there's a bunch of different
ways where you can define

00:06:07.735 --> 00:06:09.266
the equation for a line.

00:06:09.266 --> 00:06:10.359
You could say

00:06:10.359 --> 00:06:13.776
a line has a form y is equal to mx plus b

00:06:14.651 --> 00:06:17.530
where m is the slope and
b is the y intercept.

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:19.724
Well we already know what
the slope of this line is.

00:06:19.724 --> 00:06:21.081
It is negative two.

00:06:21.081 --> 00:06:25.115
So we could say y is
equal to negative two.

00:06:25.115 --> 00:06:26.865
Negative two times x.

00:06:28.165 --> 00:06:30.173
Times x plus b.

00:06:30.173 --> 00:06:31.054
And then to solve for b,

00:06:31.054 --> 00:06:33.765
we know that the point
negative one comma three

00:06:33.765 --> 00:06:35.104
is on this line

00:06:35.104 --> 00:06:37.168
and this goes back to
some of your Algebra I

00:06:37.168 --> 00:06:39.075
that you might have
learned a few years ago.

00:06:39.075 --> 00:06:42.910
So let's substitute negative
one and three for x and y.

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:44.111
So when y

00:06:44.111 --> 00:06:45.611
is equal to three,

00:06:47.062 --> 00:06:47.895
so three,

00:06:48.897 --> 00:06:50.397
three is equal to,

00:06:51.993 --> 00:06:54.076
is equal to negative two,

00:06:55.089 --> 00:06:56.839
negative two times x.

00:06:58.264 --> 00:07:00.217
Times negative one,

00:07:00.217 --> 00:07:02.384
times negative one plus b.

00:07:03.232 --> 00:07:04.718
Plus b.

00:07:04.718 --> 00:07:05.551
And so let's see,

00:07:05.551 --> 00:07:09.241
this is negative two times
negative one is positive two.

00:07:09.241 --> 00:07:11.393
And so if you subtract
two from both sides,

00:07:11.393 --> 00:07:13.282
you get one is equal to b.

00:07:13.282 --> 00:07:14.722
And there you have it.

00:07:14.722 --> 00:07:16.763
That is equation of our line.

00:07:16.763 --> 00:07:20.304
Y is equal to negative two x plus one.

00:07:20.304 --> 00:07:21.885
And there's other ways that
you could have done this,

00:07:21.885 --> 00:07:25.838
you could have written the
line in point-slope form

00:07:25.838 --> 00:07:26.945
or you could have done it this way.

00:07:26.945 --> 00:07:28.393
You could have written it in standard form

00:07:28.393 --> 00:07:31.880
but at least this is the way
my brain likes to process it.
