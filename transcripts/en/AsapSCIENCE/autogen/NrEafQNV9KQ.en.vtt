00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:04.720
 Whether your dilemma is forgetting your keys, 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.640
 Or trying to fill the information in your mind before the test, 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.580
 Sometimes we need to have our mind less forgotten, 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.940
 So, scientifically, how can memory be improved? 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:16.940
 First you have to go to a gym, 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.980
 But excuse yourself, you can not escape the cardio exercises. 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.300
 Magnetic resonance imaging results indicate that aerobic exercises such as running ... 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:29.180
 Improve the performance of memory functions by increasing blood flow in parts of the "hippocampus" in the brain 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.100
 The importance of this is that the "Hippocampus" part of the brain, 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.280
 It is an important part of learning and remembering, 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.280
 But decreases annually by 1 to 2 in late puberty. 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.720
 Aerobic exercise is therefore an effective way to combat memory aging. 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.080
 After exercise and a snack, 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.980
 After a meal, both high glucose and insulin work on 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.900
 Promote learning new information, 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.980
 Glucose and insulin are important elements 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.960
 In support of short- to long-term memory transformation, 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.760
 This may be due to the "hippocampus" enhanced by insulin receptors. 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.620
 Try adding berries to your rich meal 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.240
 Studies show that participants who were given updated berries 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.900
 Have become more able to remember past events. 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.500
 The berries contain flavonoids, which protect neurons 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.740
 Improves their functions and stimulates their regeneration. 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.040
 Be sure to communicate with others, 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.860
 Where scientists linked successful personal relationships with good memory, 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.600
 In 2017 a study showed that adults aged 80 and over 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.660
 And who have happier relationships in their old age 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.620
 They have mental abilities equal to those aged 50 and 60. 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.840
 Other studies have shown that people interview 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.900
 May protect against weak memory common in mental illness 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.040
 Scientists believe that our friends produce social pressure. 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.900
 Which makes us care about ourselves 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:50.240
 It makes you do simple things directly or otherwise as a doctor visit. 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:55.940
 Social interaction makes you face complex intellectual challenges that stimulate the mind. 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.040
 Are not you friends? 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.500
 Embrace your friends right away because they stimulate your memory. 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.180
 If you really want to stimulate your memory 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.300
 You can be the hero of remembering. 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.840
 Champions can remember to arrange a set of cards in 30 seconds. 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.680
 High memory skills are not attributed to the different structural structure of the body, 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.360
 Which means you can accomplish such mental activities .. 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:20.900
 Through intensive practice. 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.700
 One study showed that after 6 weeks .. 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.600
 Consisting of a training program for 30 minutes a day, 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.780
 Ordinary people showed the results of neural connections similar to those of memory reminders. 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.760
 When they gave a list of 72 words 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.400
 Instead of remembering 26-32 words, they could remember more than 60 words. 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.820
 If you are afraid to forget your lecture tomorrow 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.980
 do not worry... 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:46.200
 Because research suggests that a high degree of anxiety helps you remember details 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.580
 During disturbing events, different hormones such as cortisol work 

00:02:48.585 --> 00:02:51.755
 Stimulates the mind to form long-term memory. 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.360
 Perhaps this enables us to deal with disturbing situations and change our actions accordingly, 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.840
 This does not mean, that during difficult times 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.640
 We will become better at remembering things, 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.840
 Because intense anxiety weakens memory. 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:10.700
 It is therefore important to balance the panic and the lack of it to the benefit of your mind.
