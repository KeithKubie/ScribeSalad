00:00:00.109 --> 00:00:02.025
Okay, so let's see ho we'd solve this problem.

00:00:02.025 --> 00:00:06.275
The first thing we're going to do is to change the square routine into a cubed routine

00:00:06.275 --> 00:00:07.879
and change the math accordingly.

00:00:07.879 --> 00:00:09.848
So now we're going to change square to cube.

00:00:09.848 --> 00:00:15.323
And instead of computing f x f, now we simply compute f x f x f.

00:00:15.323 --> 00:00:19.158
Now, since our new name is cube here, we are going to have to scroll all the way back down here.

00:00:19.158 --> 00:00:24.025
And instead of launching square, we've now launched q.

00:00:24.025 --> 00:00:26.531
The next thing we have to change is the allocation.

00:00:26.531 --> 00:00:31.970
Now, instead of running this on 64 elements, we want to run this on 96 elements.

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:39.043
We've conveniently written this code such that everything is done in terms of array size, including the allocations.

00:00:39.043 --> 00:00:40.879
That should be all that we need to do.

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:44.282
Now, let's go over to my shell window and demonstrate that this works, okay?

00:00:44.282 --> 00:00:46.752
Now we're going to do it in our own terminal window.

00:00:46.752 --> 00:00:50.956
First, I'll make sure to show you that I actually made the changes in this file.

00:00:50.956 --> 00:00:56.161
Notice that we now have a cube routine, f x f x f and now 96.

00:00:56.161 --> 00:00:59.796
Now, we're going to compile it into a cube executable.

00:00:59.796 --> 00:01:02.101
Then we're going to run it.

00:01:02.101 --> 00:01:07.564
Notice that instead of printing out squares now it prints 0, 1, 8, 27 and so on.

00:01:07.564 --> 00:01:09.340
Ninety-six cubes altogether.

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.814
Okay, good work. Let's move on.
