00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.520
You know what we all have?

00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:03.640
(murmuring) existential loneliness

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:08.380
I'm very vocal about going to therapy and something that comes up again and again and again

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:13.520
is that the messages we received as children carry themselves into our adulthood.

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.900
Daddy! Look what I found! Can I keep him?

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:25.080
Oh, no sweetie. I'm sorry - we move too much to keep any animals. But you know what? When you grow up, you can have as many cats as you want. Okay?

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:29.680
I can have as many cats as I want when I grow up.

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:37.840
How our fathers treat our mothers greatly influences how we view relationships and what we accept as normal.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:46.880
For daughters, this often affects our self esteem. We see how our father treats our mom, and however our mom responds, that's what we learn relationships are and what we should tolerate.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:51.600
Our mothers are our role models and we look to our fathers to see how we should be treated.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.600
For sons, they often look to their father to see what being a man means and how they should treat their partners.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:04.580
And this is why we're often attracted to people who resemble our parents. Not only because it's familiar, but it's literally the definition of the love we were raised on.

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.380
Whether these qualities are good, like charismatic, intelligent, and kind

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:15.740
Or bad, like emotionally unavailable, uncommunicative, or distant. We repeat our past patterns with new partners.

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.600
I'll prove to you that I'm worthy of love! Love me!

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.260
Now, whatever your individual issues may be, I urge you to at least be aware of them.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:27.640
'Cause there's bound to be both positive and negative aspects of what we learned from our parents.

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:35.440
And if you find yourself often choosing partners who only mirror the negative qualities, then it's time to look at the choices you're making.

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:42.740
Because whether or not we realize it, we are instinctively making choices in our adult lives that reinforce our past traumas

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.020
And who wants that?

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.040
Anna: Pffft, not me. 
Video Anna (on screen): Dude, me either.

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:51.000
Anna: I know right? I feel like I do always go for people who have the most negative aspects of my parents.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.720
Video Anna: Ohmigod, girl, tell me about it. I am so tired of dating my dad.

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.000
Both: AMEN *snaps*

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.180
Video Anna: Now hit that like button!

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:04.520
One of the easiest ways to kind of figure out what patterns you're reinforcing is to *ding* make a list. I love lists!

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:12.620
First write out the negative and positive qualities of both your mother and your father. And then you make similar lists for the three most significant relationships in your life.

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.800
Now look at these lists, and see what they all have in common in both areas.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:26.420
Being self aware is great! But actually breaking these patterns takes a lot of time and hard work and reflection and constant checking in and conscious decision making and even I have not really gotten there yet.

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.320
And I've been aware of my own issues for like 10 years. BUT getting better every day!

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.560
I'm Anna Akana. Stay awesome, Gotham.

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.860

Whether you want to feel healthier, or get motivated, or learn something new.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.500
I read roughly 70-100 books a year,

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:51.300
and at least 10 of those are audiobooks that I listen to while I'm stuck in copious amounts of LA traffic, doing laundry, or stretching

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:56.000
I'm currently listening to Women Who Love Too Much by Robin Norwood and it is eye opening.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.600
Y'all know I love the opportunity to work on myself and this audiobook has shed a lot of light on my relationships and the choices I made in them.
