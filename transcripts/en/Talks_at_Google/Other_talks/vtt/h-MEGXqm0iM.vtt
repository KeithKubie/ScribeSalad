Sometimes we are teased.

saw in the number,

Addy signs up Uno for the
Math Mania competition

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:54.710
because she wants--

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:57.260
first off, she wants him
to get over his fears

I'm going to tell you one, OK?

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:22.320
What do you call

Well, as we've just said,
we're here at "Addy and Uno."

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:32.160
I am Tom.

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.200
I'm the producer of
this show, and with

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.290
me right now is one of my
very best friends, Anastasia.

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:38.421
[CHEERING]

00:04:38.421 --> 00:04:41.760
ANASTASIA: I'm the consulting
producer on this show.

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.550
And one of the reasons why
I think a show like this

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:46.590
is so important, and
one of the reasons

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:50.485
why I would love it if all of
you guys tell all your friends,

00:04:50.485 --> 00:04:53.940
and all your friend's families,
and come see the show,

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.700
is because when I was
little, like you guys,

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:00.360
I didn't have
characters on the stage,

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:04.470
or on television, or in the
movies that looked like me.

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:07.530
And I think it's really
great that the show allows

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:11.910
kids who are like me to see
themselves on the stage.

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:15.900
But it also teaches all of us
about how important kindness

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:20.010
is, and that's a message that
we think everybody should

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:22.860
learn and help us to spread.

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:24.090
TOM: Yes.

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:26.490
Big and little kids alike,
kindness makes a difference.

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:28.960
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:32.280
So we're going to do
another song for you.

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:36.010
At this moment of the show,
as Addy told you earlier,

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:39.600
RJ, he loves science
and he loves rockets.

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:43.590
And he just built the
most amazing rocket, which

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:46.530
makes me think of another joke.

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:49.986
Why did the cow get
on the rocket ship?

00:05:49.986 --> 00:05:50.724
AUDIENCE: I know.

00:05:50.724 --> 00:05:51.640
TOM: You want to tell?

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:52.630
You can do it.

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:54.510
AUDIENCE: He wanted
to go to the moon.

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:56.830
TOM: Because he wanted
to go to the moon.

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:57.330
[CHEERING]

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:57.800

[CHEERING]

00:05:58.270 --> 00:05:58.770
All right.

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:00.680
We're going to hire
you for the next show.

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:01.260
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:02.740
He delivers that better than me.

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:04.470
MELODY: Perfect, yeah.

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:08.000
TOM: But unfortunately,
it doesn't stay super fun

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.720
because the bullies take
RJ's rocket from him,

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:12.560
and they break it.

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.180
And I bet you, you
know, we've all

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:16.870
had a time where
someone's picked on us

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:17.900
or a bully's been mean.

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:21.080
And we know that is no
fun, and it is absolutely

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:22.730
the wrong thing to do.

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:25.340
So RJ's friends try
to lift his spirits.

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:28.940
And RJ, through the next song,
lets us all know that no matter

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:31.340
what, he's not going to
give up on his dreams,

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:33.620
and he can achieve anything.

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:36.197
And this is your favorite song
on the show, right, Anastasia?

00:06:36.197 --> 00:06:38.030
ANASTASIA: It's my
favorite song in the show

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:40.580
because when I was
little, I actually

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:43.520
did think I could
fly in my wheelchair,

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:46.096
and I love that RJ
thinks that too.

00:06:46.096 --> 00:06:48.530
And I'm really excited
for you to see it.

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:51.110
TOM: This song is
called "Watch Me Fly."

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:52.280
Take it RJ.

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:53.741
[CHEERING]

00:06:53.741 --> 00:06:57.150
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:06.640
RJ (SINGING): The easiest thing
to do is give up and give in.

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:11.360
The hardest thing to do
is stay strong and win.

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:20.140
But I just know I'm never
letting go of my dream.

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:24.980
Though people like to say
I'm too weak, I'm too small.

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:29.690
There's too much in my
way, I'll miss, I'll fall.

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:35.542
But I just know I'm
stronger than I seem.

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:43.180
Because I've got wings on
my back, fuel in my heart.

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:47.950
There are mountains to
see, clouds left to part.

00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:50.650
I've got friends on the ride.

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:52.810
I know I'll reach the sky.

00:07:56.730 --> 00:08:00.660
Watch me fly.

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:02.240
Watch me fly.

00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:11.970
From morning to the night,
I'll work with the pieces.

00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:15.730
Build it till it's right,
then test it, release it.

00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:24.932
Because I just know I'm
getting closer to my dream.

00:08:24.932 --> 00:08:29.489
And no one will
tell me what to do.

00:08:29.489 --> 00:08:33.400
And no one will
tell me what to say.

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:43.224
The day they watch me
rise and zoom away, away.

00:08:43.224 --> 00:08:48.020
Because I've got wings on
my back, fuel in my heart.

00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:53.136
There are mountains to
see, clouds left to part.

00:08:53.136 --> 00:08:55.351
I've got friends on the ride.

00:08:55.351 --> 00:08:58.021
I know I'll reach the sky.

00:09:01.318 --> 00:09:02.731
Watch me fly.

00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:07.268
Watch me fly.

00:09:11.450 --> 00:09:14.510
Every single year
we read about all

00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:20.410
of the greats, FDR, Frida
Kahlo, they defied their fate.

00:09:20.410 --> 00:09:24.980
And every time I see a
star shoot across the sky,

00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:33.338
I look at it and think
if they can, why can't I?

00:09:33.338 --> 00:09:35.818
Watch me fly.

00:09:42.266 --> 00:09:45.242
Watch me fly.

00:10:00.122 --> 00:10:02.566
Watch me fly.

00:10:09.856 --> 00:10:11.800
Thank you, RJ.

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:13.040
That was beautiful.

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:14.810
That was so wonderful.

00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:16.270
Do you guys like rockets?

00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:18.300
Clap if you like rockets.

00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:18.930

00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:19.730
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:19.730 --> 00:10:21.770
Not going to spoil
it, but RJ does

00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:24.440
get a new, beautiful rocket,
and it's painted gold.

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:25.450
So cool.

00:10:25.450 --> 00:10:26.520
Oh, look at-- whoa.

00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:28.190
You have a rocket.

00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:29.480
That's an amazing rocket.

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:30.140
RJ: That looks just like mine.

00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:31.190
TOM: That's awesome.

00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:32.870
Wow.

00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:35.749
Well, we're going to do
one more song for you guys.

00:10:35.749 --> 00:10:36.290
OK, and fine.

00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:37.830
I'll do one more joke.

00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:40.880
How do you get a
Kleenex to dance?

00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:42.706
Put a little boogie into it.

00:10:42.706 --> 00:10:43.414
Come on, come on.

00:10:43.414 --> 00:10:44.330
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:45.060
Come on.

00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:45.996
You like it.

00:10:45.996 --> 00:10:47.400
Whoa.

00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:49.490
Oh, OK.

00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:53.930
So our last song
today, Uno really

00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:56.980
wants to compete in Math Mania,
but he's still so afraid,

00:10:56.980 --> 00:10:59.970
and he's very afraid that the
bullies are going to tease him.

00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:03.710
So his friends get
behind him and tell him

00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:07.010
that no matter what he
decides, that they'll still

00:11:07.010 --> 00:11:10.070
be friends and everything
is still going to be OK.

00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:14.030
Because no matter what happens,
you can count on your friends.

00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:16.146
Take it, guys and girls.

00:11:16.146 --> 00:11:16.970

00:11:28.591 --> 00:11:29.090
Uh.

00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:31.448
It can feel like much too much.

00:11:31.448 --> 00:11:32.300
Uh huh.

00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:36.762
But you have got the talent,
what's the harm in trying?

00:11:36.762 --> 00:11:39.085
You have got the Midas Touch.

00:11:39.085 --> 00:11:40.520

So think it over,
can't get too excited.

00:11:55.867 --> 00:11:59.276
And think it over and over.

00:11:59.276 --> 00:12:02.198
Whoa, you've got
to stay laid back.

00:12:02.198 --> 00:12:04.633
There's no need to hurry.

a mistake or fail,

00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:17.795
they're going to
point and laugh.

00:12:17.795 --> 00:12:19.900

They're a huge distraction.

00:12:24.618 --> 00:12:27.040

00:16:03.734 --> 00:16:05.761
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:08.100
Because it's not your cheese.

00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:08.615
Get it?

00:16:08.615 --> 00:16:10.150
Because it's cheese,
but it's not--

00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:10.700
joke.

00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:11.270
That's the joke.

00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:12.270
AUDIENCE: I have a joke.

00:16:12.270 --> 00:16:12.875
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:12.875 --> 00:16:13.375
TOM: Yeah?

00:16:13.375 --> 00:16:15.560
Do you want to come
up and tell me?

00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:16.678
ADDY: Oh, cool.

00:16:16.678 --> 00:16:17.526
MELODY: Yeah, yeah.

00:16:17.526 --> 00:16:19.170
TOM: What's your joke?

00:16:19.170 --> 00:16:20.010
Oh, using the--

00:16:20.010 --> 00:16:20.620
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:22.572
[CHEERING]

00:16:22.572 --> 00:16:23.548
[APPLAUSE]

00:16:23.548 --> 00:16:25.894
AUDIENCE: Who let the
poop in the toilet?

00:16:25.894 --> 00:16:27.310
TOM: Watches a
poop in the toilet.

00:16:27.310 --> 00:16:30.792
AUDIENCE: You have to flush the
toilet and put in your poop.

00:16:30.792 --> 00:16:31.291
[CHEERING]

00:16:31.291 --> 00:16:32.692
TOM: Yes!

00:16:32.692 --> 00:16:33.859
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:33.859 --> 00:16:35.027
High five.

00:16:35.027 --> 00:16:36.464
[CHEERING]

00:16:36.464 --> 00:16:37.838
I'm putting that
right in my act.

00:16:37.838 --> 00:16:38.690
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:38.690 --> 00:16:41.084
What we're going to do now is--

00:16:41.084 --> 00:16:42.912
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:44.290 --> 00:16:44.944
You're hired.

00:16:44.944 --> 00:16:45.652
MELODY: Good job.

00:16:45.652 --> 00:16:47.249
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:47.249 --> 00:16:48.790
TOM: So in a couple
of seconds, we're

00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:49.970
going to ask some questions.

00:16:49.970 --> 00:16:53.200
So in the next minute or
so, think of a question,

00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:55.990
and I'll come out with
an elegant microphone

00:16:55.990 --> 00:16:57.090
and we can ask questions.

00:16:57.090 --> 00:17:00.550
And the cast, and Anastasia,
and even I will answer some.

00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:03.582
And then we'll take
pictures with the cast.

00:17:03.582 --> 00:17:05.290
But first, we just
want to thank you all.

00:17:05.290 --> 00:17:06.369
Do you have a joke for me?

00:17:06.369 --> 00:17:06.700
All right.

00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:07.990
Think about it in one minute.

00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:10.024
We're going to knock
it out of the park, OK?

00:17:10.024 --> 00:17:10.524
MELODY: Yes.

00:17:10.524 --> 00:17:11.290
[GIGGLING]

00:17:11.290 --> 00:17:13.456
TOM: But thank you so much
to all the amazing people

00:17:13.456 --> 00:17:14.109
at Google.

00:17:14.109 --> 00:17:14.890
I love Google.

00:17:14.890 --> 00:17:16.550
I Google myself daily.

00:17:16.550 --> 00:17:17.050
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:17.050 --> 00:17:19.871
I'm sure you all do too,
so it's pretty great.

00:17:19.871 --> 00:17:22.079
And the amazing Bonnie, who
brought us here and wrote

00:17:22.079 --> 00:17:23.053
this beautiful music.

00:17:23.053 --> 00:17:24.030
[CHEERING]

00:17:24.030 --> 00:17:28.267
She's not here, but Dr.
Nava Silton, wrote the play.

00:17:28.267 --> 00:17:29.850
And she's wonderful,
but she's at home

00:17:29.850 --> 00:17:32.247
with the beautiful new baby.

00:17:32.247 --> 00:17:34.830
Thank you to our beautiful cast
and all of you amazing people.

00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:37.759
If you liked what you
saw, and I hope you did,

00:17:37.759 --> 00:17:38.550
please come see us.

00:17:38.550 --> 00:17:41.760
We play at Theater Row
on West 42nd Street

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:44.170
every Saturday at noon.

00:17:44.170 --> 00:17:50.307
You can go to www.addyanduno.com
for all the information

00:17:50.307 --> 00:17:51.390
on tickets and everything.

00:17:51.390 --> 00:17:53.037
And kids, just this
once, I give you

00:17:53.037 --> 00:17:55.620
permission to totally nag your
parents to make them bring you.

00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:56.100
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:57.150
Like, you totally should.

00:17:57.150 --> 00:17:57.733
MELODY: Do it.

00:17:57.733 --> 00:18:01.740
TOM: Just-- but please tell all
your friends, because it really

00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:02.670
is a beautiful show.

00:18:02.670 --> 00:18:04.770
And I promise, kindness
makes a difference.

00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:06.990
And everybody that comes
in and sees the show,

00:18:06.990 --> 00:18:09.240
they leave knowing that
different is special

00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:12.172
and that everyone is
beautiful, no matter what.

00:18:12.172 --> 00:18:13.380
And you can count on friends.

00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:15.120
And you want to add
anything, Anastasia?

00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:17.370
Because you know once you
give me a mic, I don't stop.

00:18:17.370 --> 00:18:17.820
ANASTASIA: No.

00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:18.780
You did a great job.

00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:20.330
We want all--

00:18:20.330 --> 00:18:21.050
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:21.050 --> 00:18:23.193
We want all of the kids to--

00:18:23.193 --> 00:18:25.040
all of you to talk
to your friends,

00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:28.230
and all of your parents
to talk to-- have them

00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:30.090
talk to their friends
and tell them to come

00:18:30.090 --> 00:18:33.540
see the show because we
need help to keep it open,

00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:35.670
and we can't do that
if we don't have

00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:37.620
people to come see the show.

00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:41.580
We are also-- get the
community involved

00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:46.091
to help us keep playing this
show, we started a GoFundMe.

00:18:46.091 --> 00:18:46.590
TOM: Oh.

00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:47.140
That is true.

00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:50.580
ANASTASIA: So if you'd like more
information about the GoFundMe

00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:53.760
page, you can reach out to us
through www.addyanduno.com,

00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:57.030
and we'd be happy
to tell you what

00:18:57.030 --> 00:19:01.120
you can do to help us fund raise
and keep the show open as long

00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:01.840
as we can.

00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:02.340
So--

00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:05.910
TOM: And the goal of the page is
so we can cut ticket prices to

00:19:05.910 --> 00:19:08.720
not-- so we can become not only
the most groundbreaking family

00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:10.470
show in New York, but
the most affordable.

00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:11.969
Because the families
who need to see

00:19:11.969 --> 00:19:13.590
this most are being
priced out of it.

00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:15.720
And we're going to,
through the GoFundMe,

00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:18.807
create a campaign that puts
a block of sponsor tickets

00:19:18.807 --> 00:19:19.890
on our website every week.

00:19:19.890 --> 00:19:22.502
So no matter what, every
family and every child

00:19:22.502 --> 00:19:23.460
can see "Addy and Uno."

00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:25.680
So if you want to check it
out and tell your friends,

00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:28.100
we'd love it because we
want everyone to see this.

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:29.430
ANASTASIA: And we also want--

00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:31.590
we've had a lot of
people approach us

00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:33.390
about bringing it
to the board of Ed,

00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:35.940
but again, it's an
issue of funding.

00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:40.370
A lot of schools want to
bring it to their schools

00:19:40.370 --> 00:19:44.570
and have it be apart,
but they can't afford it.

00:19:44.570 --> 00:19:47.327
So if we're able to raise
the money, then we can also--

00:19:47.327 --> 00:19:48.035
TOM: We're going.

00:19:48.035 --> 00:19:48.868
We'll go everywhere.

00:19:48.868 --> 00:19:50.950
ANASTASIA: We can tour
the schools as well,

00:19:50.950 --> 00:19:52.920
which would be really great.

00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:54.870
TOM: Now it's the fun time.

00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:56.820
Any question you like.

00:19:56.820 --> 00:19:58.560
I'll even tell more
jokes, if you ask.

00:19:58.560 --> 00:19:59.110
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:59.110 --> 00:20:01.380
And you've been
waiting so patiently.

00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:02.940
We're going to start with you.

00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:03.990
I'm going to get
right down here,

00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:05.614
because you're a
little taller than me.

00:20:05.614 --> 00:20:06.450
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:06.450 --> 00:20:07.800
What do you got for me?

00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:10.710
AUDIENCE: Why didn't the
skeleton go to the dance?

00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:11.880
TOM: Why didn't the--

00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:12.380
what?

00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:13.421
AUDIENCE: That was wrong.

00:20:13.421 --> 00:20:15.520
AUDIENCE: Why did the skeleton--

00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:17.410
AUDIENCE: Why didn't
the skeleton burp?

00:20:17.410 --> 00:20:19.979
TOM: Why didn't
the skeleton burp?

00:20:19.979 --> 00:20:22.270
AUDIENCE: Because he didn't
have the guts to fart with.

00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:24.186
TOM: Oh, he didn't have
the guts to fart with.

00:20:24.186 --> 00:20:24.771
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:24.771 --> 00:20:25.684
Oh.

00:20:25.684 --> 00:20:26.184
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:26.184 --> 00:20:27.130
That was epic.

00:20:27.130 --> 00:20:28.142
High five.

00:20:28.142 --> 00:20:29.086
Amazing joke.

00:20:29.086 --> 00:20:32.210
So does anyone
have any questions?

00:20:32.210 --> 00:20:34.994
Raise your hand, and I
will run over to you.

00:20:34.994 --> 00:20:35.910
You have another joke?

00:20:35.910 --> 00:20:36.410
All right.

00:20:36.410 --> 00:20:37.210
Why not?

00:20:37.210 --> 00:20:39.210
AUDIENCE: What did the
pirate say when you stuck

00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:40.740
his wooden leg in the freezer?

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:42.490
TOM: What did the
pirate say when he stuck

00:20:42.490 --> 00:20:43.810
his wooden leg in the freezer?

00:20:43.810 --> 00:20:44.650
Go.

00:20:44.650 --> 00:20:46.201
AUDIENCE: Shiver me timbers.

00:20:46.201 --> 00:20:48.056
TOM: Oh, shiver me timbers.

00:20:48.056 --> 00:20:48.556
Hilarious.

00:20:48.556 --> 00:20:49.056
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:49.056 --> 00:20:49.605
You're hired.

00:20:49.605 --> 00:20:50.230
ADDY: Good job.

00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:50.600
TOM: OK.

00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:52.891
Does anyone have any questions
about the puppets, about

00:20:52.891 --> 00:20:56.350
the show, about Addy
and Uno, about anything

00:20:56.350 --> 00:20:57.910
to do with performing?

00:20:57.910 --> 00:21:02.491
We're-- believe it or not,
we're super professional.

00:21:02.491 --> 00:21:03.990
What about-- do you
have a question?

00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:05.185
ANASTASIA: Remember,
all the puppets

00:21:05.185 --> 00:21:06.522
can answer your questions, so--

00:21:06.522 --> 00:21:08.230
TOM: The puppet can
answer your question,

00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:10.110
the actor can answer
your question.

00:21:10.110 --> 00:21:11.231
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:11.231 --> 00:21:11.730
TOM: Yes.

00:21:11.730 --> 00:21:13.572
I'm on my way.

00:21:13.572 --> 00:21:15.060
AUDIENCE: Yay.

00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:16.976
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:16.976 --> 00:21:18.142
TOM: Do you have a question?

00:21:18.142 --> 00:21:18.554
You can tell--

00:21:18.554 --> 00:21:19.845
AUDIENCE: What happened to Uno?

00:21:19.845 --> 00:21:20.620
TOM: What--

00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:21.840
UNO: What happened to Uno.

00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:22.620
TOM: Oh, OK.

00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:26.244
So what happened to Uno once
he entered the competition?

00:21:26.244 --> 00:21:28.410
UNO: Well, you're going to
have to come see the play

00:21:28.410 --> 00:21:29.700
to find out.

00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:32.100
I don't want to give
away the ending.

00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:34.020
TOM: We can't tell
you if he wins, but--

00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:34.486
AUDIENCE: He wins.

00:21:34.486 --> 00:21:34.985
MELODY: Hey.

00:21:34.985 --> 00:21:35.851
[GASPS]

00:21:35.851 --> 00:21:36.350
Hey.

00:21:36.350 --> 00:21:37.387
UNO: Don't ruin it.

00:21:37.387 --> 00:21:37.970
Spoiler alert.

00:21:37.970 --> 00:21:39.261
ANASTASIA: I was going to say--

00:21:39.261 --> 00:21:41.520
I was going to say we
can't give away the ending,

00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:44.711
but we can say that
Uno is super brave.

00:21:44.711 --> 00:21:45.210
TOM: He is.

00:21:45.210 --> 00:21:46.770
We love Uno.

00:21:46.770 --> 00:21:47.270
Oh.

00:21:47.270 --> 00:21:48.923
I-- oh.

00:21:48.923 --> 00:21:50.080
AUDIENCE: I have a joke.

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:50.580

00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:39.088

when you started performing?

00:23:32.870 --> 00:23:34.160
Brent, start with you.

00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:37.427
BRENT: I was actually four years
old when I first sang on stage.

00:23:37.427 --> 00:23:38.510

VANESSA: I didn't start
acting until I was, like, 16.

00:23:44.106 --> 00:23:45.290
So I was a little bit older.

00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:08.120
Audition for shows.

It's the best way
to make friends.

00:24:09.810 --> 00:24:10.400
Go for it.

00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:12.260
Don't listen to anyone
who tells you can't.

00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:15.135
You got to follow those
dreams, very important.

00:24:15.135 --> 00:24:16.010
What about over here?

00:24:16.010 --> 00:24:17.260
You guys have been so awesome.

00:24:17.260 --> 00:24:19.110
Do you have any questions?

00:24:19.110 --> 00:24:20.625
Did you enjoy my jokes?

AUDIENCE: You know, I'm doing
the play from like, "Charlie

00:24:40.727 --> 00:24:42.894

00:24:42.894 --> 00:24:43.758
Whoa.

00:24:43.758 --> 00:24:46.204
We're going to get
a golden ticket.

00:24:46.204 --> 00:24:46.751
[CHEERING]

00:24:46.751 --> 00:24:47.250
TOM: Whoa.

00:24:47.250 --> 00:24:48.405
He's doing "Charlie and
the Chocolate Factory,"

00:24:48.405 --> 00:24:49.570
and he's going to
get a golden ticket.

00:24:49.570 --> 00:24:50.195
That's amazing.

00:24:50.195 --> 00:24:51.644
AUDIENCE: We get to keep it.

00:24:51.644 --> 00:24:52.644
TOM: You get to keep it?

00:24:52.644 --> 00:24:53.477
ADDY: That's so cool

00:24:53.477 --> 00:24:54.480
TOM: High five there.

00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:55.750
Congratulations.

00:24:55.750 --> 00:24:56.310
Oh.

00:24:56.310 --> 00:24:57.690
That's high up there.

00:24:57.690 --> 00:24:58.580
Any more questions?

00:24:58.580 --> 00:25:00.765
Yes.

00:25:00.765 --> 00:25:02.640
AUDIENCE: I watched the
"Wizard of Oz" today.

00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:05.260
TOM: You watched
the "Wizard of Oz?"

00:25:05.260 --> 00:25:05.970
Today?

00:25:05.970 --> 00:25:08.600
That's so random, and then
he said he did the play.

00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:10.019
That's the coolest news.

00:25:10.019 --> 00:25:11.310
All right, so if you got-- yes.

00:25:11.310 --> 00:25:13.268
Last question, then we're
going to take photos.

00:25:13.268 --> 00:25:15.960
AUDIENCE: What happened to
the guy with the wheelchair?

00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:18.043
TOM: What happened to the
guy with the wheelchair?

00:25:18.043 --> 00:25:20.190
Anastasia, why does
he have a wheelchair?

00:25:20.190 --> 00:25:22.296
ANASTASIA: Why does
RJ have a wheelchair.

00:25:22.296 --> 00:25:22.920
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:25.510
ANASTASIA: Because
he has a disability

00:25:25.510 --> 00:25:28.350
called cerebral
palsy, and it just

00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:31.300
means that he doesn't
have a lot of balance.

00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:35.010
So his legs work, and
he can walk, like I can.

00:25:35.010 --> 00:25:38.490
I can stand up and move
around on my own legs,

00:25:38.490 --> 00:25:41.280
but I can't stand up by
myself because I just

00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:42.944
don't have really good balance.

00:25:42.944 --> 00:25:48.392
So the chair helps me move long
distances, the same like RJ.

00:25:48.392 --> 00:25:49.350
TOM: And just like RJ--

00:25:49.350 --> 00:25:51.690
I will brag as one
of her dear friends--

00:25:51.690 --> 00:25:54.480
it doesn't stop Anastasia
from doing anything.

00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:57.520
She's a brilliant
Georgetown graduate.

00:25:57.520 --> 00:25:58.800
She's amazing.

00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:00.840
Some of you might
have seen her on TV

00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:03.060
giving a prime-time speech
at the Democratic National

00:26:03.060 --> 00:26:04.720

million people.

00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:05.220
ADDY: Yes.

00:26:05.220 --> 00:26:08.660
TOM: She is proof that you
can do anything you want,

00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:10.740
and that there are no barriers.

00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:12.266
[APPLAUSE]

00:26:12.266 --> 00:26:13.890
And I'm lucky enough
that she's my BFF.

00:26:13.890 --> 00:26:14.831
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:14.831 --> 00:26:15.330
All right.

00:26:15.330 --> 00:26:16.295
So let's take photos.

00:26:16.295 --> 00:26:16.660
ADDY: Yeah.

00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:18.035
TOM: If you want
to take a photo,

00:26:18.035 --> 00:26:20.340
let's line up at
the steps, and we

00:26:20.340 --> 00:26:21.680
can take fabulous photographs.
