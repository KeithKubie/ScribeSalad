00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:02.550
"Scotty" on Star Trek Was Shot Six Times on
D-Day

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:08.839
Famed Star Trek actor, James Doohan a.k.a.
“Scotty”, was shot six times during WWII.

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:10.199
How did this happen?

00:00:10.199 --> 00:00:14.009
After leading his men through a mine field
on Juno beach and personally taking out two

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.140
German snipers in the process, Doohan took
four rounds in one of his legs; one in his

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.919
hand, which ultimately resulted in him losing
his middle finger; and one in his chest.

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:27.789
The shot to the chest likely would have been
fatal except that he had a silver cigarette

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:29.910
case there that deflected the bullet.

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.010
He would later give up smoking, but at least
he could say that being a smoker actually

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:35.620
saved his life.

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.000
Funny enough, the shots he took were not fired
by the enemy, but rather by an overzealous

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.680
Canadian gunman.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.219
After Doohan’s unit was secured in their
position for the night, he was crossing between

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:49.570
command posts when a Canadian gunman spotted
him and opened fire.

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:54.370
Doohan originally joined the Canadian Forces
at the age of 19, eventually being commissioned

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.170
a Lieutenant in the Royal Canadian Artillery.

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.590
D-Day was the first and last action he saw
in the war.

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.690
After recovering from his injuries, he became
a pilot in the Canadian Air Force, but never

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:05.950
flew in combat.

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.300
Despite this, he was once called “the craziest
pilot in the Canadian Air Force” when he

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:15.270
flew a plane through two telegraph poles after
“slaloming” down a mountainside, just

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.070
to prove it could be done.

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.390
This act was not looked upon highly by his
superiors, but earned him a reputation among

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.920
the pilots of the Canadian Air Force.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.260
Bonus Facts:
• As mentioned, contrary to what many people

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.470
think, Doohan was not Scottish.

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:30.600
He was Canadian.

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.380
When he was auditioning for the role of the
ship’s engineer, he went over various accents

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.650
for Gene Roddenberry for the character.

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:41.340
After he finished, Roddenberry asked him which
he liked best and he responded: “Well, if

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.510
you want an engineer, he better be a Scotsman
because, in my experience, all the world’s

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:48.250
best engineers have been Scottish.”

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:53.770
• While great pains were taken in Star Trek
to conceal the fact the Doohan was missing

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.310
a middle finger, there are several episodes
where this can be observed, such as Cat’s

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.470
Paw; Day of the Dove and The Lights of Zetar.

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.770
This can also be observed in a scene in Star
Trek III: The Search for Spock and In Star

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.119
Trek V: The Final Frontier.

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.980
In the former, it can be observed when he
hands McCoy parts for the Transwarp Drive

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:18.290
and in the latter when he’s holding bagged
dinner which was given to him by Lt. Uhura.

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.690
• Doohan was married three times in his
life and fathered four children.

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:27.040
He met his final wife, Wende Braunberger,
when she was just 17 and he was 54, marrying

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.620
her very shortly after their first meeting.

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:35.060
The two had three children, the last in 2000,
and remained married for 31 years until Doohan’s

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:51.349
death in 2005 at the age of 85.
