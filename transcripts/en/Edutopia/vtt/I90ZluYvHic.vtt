00:00:08.866 --> 00:00:10.366
&gt;&gt;Scorsese: You know, I come
from a working class family.

00:00:10.366 --> 00:00:13.466
My mother and father
weren't well-educated.

00:00:13.706 --> 00:00:18.736
Second generation, I
guess, Italian American.

00:00:18.956 --> 00:00:22.876
And there was no tradition
of reading in the house.

00:00:22.876 --> 00:00:26.696
No books. Of course, I read in
school, etc. I read books in school

00:00:26.696 --> 00:00:30.746
and that sort of thing, but the--
it was more of a visual tradition,

00:00:30.746 --> 00:00:33.686
more if-- I was taken
to movie theaters a lot.

00:00:33.976 --> 00:00:38.716
Also, being a sickly child
with very severe asthma,

00:00:38.746 --> 00:00:39.996
I couldn't play sports.

00:00:40.056 --> 00:00:41.276
So, again, the movie theater.

00:00:41.276 --> 00:00:42.276
The movie theater and the church.

00:00:42.276 --> 00:00:43.266
The church and the movie theatre.

00:00:43.656 --> 00:00:48.266
And so, along with the films, there
was also the advent of television,

00:00:48.266 --> 00:00:51.946
1948, '49, in the heyday
of really the best--

00:00:51.946 --> 00:00:53.886
some of the best programming
in American television--

00:00:53.936 --> 00:00:55.766
in the history of American television

00:00:55.766 --> 00:00:58.196
up to this point with
the fifties, 1950s.

00:00:58.196 --> 00:01:04.376
And so I saw a lot of television
shows, but also films on television.

00:01:04.376 --> 00:01:07.406
Being a working class family, too,
they didn't have enough money to go

00:01:07.406 --> 00:01:11.526
to the theatre, so theatre wasn't
an option, live stage shows.

00:01:11.566 --> 00:01:16.626
So, it was mainly visual
literacy what was--

00:01:16.776 --> 00:01:19.986
was what was happening
at that time to me.

00:01:19.986 --> 00:01:22.326
I did not understand
that that was happening.

00:01:22.546 --> 00:01:25.426
What it made me realize was
that there was an intelligence,

00:01:25.426 --> 00:01:29.066
another kind of intelligence,
that was trying to tell a story

00:01:29.426 --> 00:01:33.666
through where the director, the
writer and the cinematographer,

00:01:34.206 --> 00:01:37.866
where they were focusing
your eyes, you know.

00:01:37.866 --> 00:01:41.466
Whether it was the-- the camera
may be at an extremely low angle,

00:01:41.846 --> 00:01:46.306
looking up at you, the use of
the lens, the size of the lens.

00:01:46.306 --> 00:01:49.306
I began to understand
certain lenses did--

00:01:49.466 --> 00:01:51.576
interpreted the story differently.

00:01:52.556 --> 00:01:55.146
A longer lens crushed everything
together and made it flat.

00:01:55.946 --> 00:01:58.596
A wider lens stretched everything
and sometimes distorted it,

00:01:58.596 --> 00:02:02.626
especially if camera movement-- I
learned looking at certain pictures,

00:02:02.656 --> 00:02:05.116
particularly Welles's films
and William Wyler, too.

00:02:05.116 --> 00:02:10.336
A wide angle lens, but Wyler used
his wide angle lens in a very strong,

00:02:10.516 --> 00:02:14.406
steady image, but Welles used
that wide angle lens, 18 mm,

00:02:14.406 --> 00:02:19.026
it turns out very often, to move
along the walls, move along--

00:02:19.196 --> 00:02:22.476
and you really felt-- I felt
as if the camera was flying,

00:02:22.476 --> 00:02:24.896
as if the story was
flying by, you know.

00:02:25.296 --> 00:02:29.226
I didn't know why until I kept
seeing the films again and again,

00:02:29.226 --> 00:02:33.516
and as I began to know a little
more about what filmmaking was like

00:02:33.516 --> 00:02:35.876
and what cameras did, and at that's--

00:02:35.876 --> 00:02:38.836
I still didn't know who
made the pictures, you know,

00:02:38.836 --> 00:02:47.496
but I was beginning to understand
that there are certain tools you use,

00:02:47.496 --> 00:02:52.906
and those tools become part of a
vocabulary that's just as valid

00:02:53.346 --> 00:02:56.956
as that vocabulary that is used
in literature and our language.

00:02:59.706 --> 00:03:03.276
&gt;&gt;Scorsese: One has to begin,
I think, reach younger people

00:03:04.166 --> 00:03:11.696
at an earlier age for that to shape
their minds to-- in a critical way--

00:03:12.056 --> 00:03:15.316
a critical way of looking at
these images and what they mean

00:03:15.616 --> 00:03:17.936
and how to interpret imagery.

00:03:18.576 --> 00:03:25.086
And I think in a more official
way, I think, than just punching

00:03:25.086 --> 00:03:27.366
up on a computer or seeing something

00:03:27.786 --> 00:03:29.756
on a TV commercial or
something like that.

00:03:29.756 --> 00:03:34.326
I think you really
need to know how ideas

00:03:34.576 --> 00:03:38.826
and emotions are expressed
through a visual form.

00:03:39.716 --> 00:03:42.616
Now that for- that form could
be video, you know, or film,

00:03:42.906 --> 00:03:45.256
probably eventually be digital
video from a long period--

00:03:45.376 --> 00:03:48.626
for a long time to come, but
it still has the same rules.

00:03:48.756 --> 00:03:53.336
And it still has the same vocabulary,
and it still has the same grammar,

00:03:53.496 --> 00:03:55.576
I should say, really
the same grammar.

00:03:55.976 --> 00:04:00.016
And the grammar is panning left and
right, tracking in or out, you know,

00:04:00.116 --> 00:04:04.486
booming up and down, intercutting
a certain way, use of a close-up

00:04:04.486 --> 00:04:05.606
as opposed to a medium shot.

00:04:05.696 --> 00:04:06.486
Was is a medium shot?

00:04:06.546 --> 00:04:07.256
What is a long shot?

00:04:07.256 --> 00:04:09.936
All these sort of things and how
do you use all of these elements

00:04:09.936 --> 00:04:12.776
and the different kinds of lighting,
and how you use all these elements

00:04:13.016 --> 00:04:15.826
to make an emotional and
psychological point to an audience,

00:04:16.036 --> 00:04:19.506
and I think we have to begin
to teach our younger people how

00:04:19.506 --> 00:04:23.216
to use this very powerful tool,
because we know film, the image,

00:04:23.216 --> 00:04:26.866
can be so strong for--
not only for good,

00:04:26.866 --> 00:04:28.326
for good use, but also for bad use.

00:04:28.326 --> 00:04:32.806
Look at World War II and look at
the films that were made in Germany.

00:04:32.806 --> 00:04:35.876
Look at the great director,
Leni Riefenstahl.

00:04:35.876 --> 00:04:39.576
Look at her "Triumph of the
Will" and how that really--

00:04:40.146 --> 00:04:44.376
the extraordinary ability
she had as a filmmaker

00:04:45.056 --> 00:04:49.106
that helped shape the policies of
the Third Reich, and of course,

00:04:49.106 --> 00:04:49.916
we know what that lead to.

00:04:50.716 --> 00:04:53.456
And so film is very powerful.

00:04:54.306 --> 00:04:57.236
Images are very powerful, I
should say, and we have to start--

00:04:57.336 --> 00:05:00.536
begin to teach younger people
how to use them and what they--

00:05:00.536 --> 00:05:02.926
and at least to begin to
understand to interpret them.

00:05:06.436 --> 00:05:08.146
&gt;&gt;Scorsese: I think it is
good if a young person wants

00:05:08.146 --> 00:05:10.506
to express themselves and take
a video camera and go out.

00:05:10.796 --> 00:05:12.916
They're going to find that
they have to frame the image,

00:05:13.966 --> 00:05:16.596
and in framing the image, they're
going to find that they have

00:05:16.656 --> 00:05:20.476
to interpret what they
want to say to an audience.

00:05:20.476 --> 00:05:23.656
And how do you point the audience's
eye to look where you want them

00:05:23.656 --> 00:05:26.306
to look and to get the point, the
emotional, psychological point

00:05:26.306 --> 00:05:27.416
that you want to get across to them.

00:05:27.416 --> 00:05:28.956
They're going to have
to make that decision.

00:05:29.276 --> 00:05:31.206
The real making of the
filmmakers when they look

00:05:31.206 --> 00:05:34.836
through that viewfinder
to tell the story,

00:05:35.706 --> 00:05:38.636
and I don't mean just telling a
story man goes, you know man--

00:05:38.636 --> 00:05:40.466
boy meets girl, boy loses
girl, boy gets girl.

00:05:40.686 --> 00:05:42.866
No, I mean a story
could be the story--

00:05:42.866 --> 00:05:48.296
a story could be rain
hitting a tree, leaves.

00:05:48.526 --> 00:05:51.416
That could be your
story, you know, but how?

00:05:51.456 --> 00:05:53.406
Where do you begin to put the camera?

00:05:53.766 --> 00:05:54.886
Then let them see what they do.

00:05:54.886 --> 00:05:57.356
Then, you know, I mean,
yes, there's a curiosity

00:05:57.356 --> 00:05:58.306
in children and young people.

00:05:58.666 --> 00:06:00.866
They may try one or two and then
they realize it's not for me,

00:06:00.866 --> 00:06:03.906
and they move on, but there might
be those one or two that realize,

00:06:03.906 --> 00:06:07.816
"And if I put the camera under
this leaf and I see this drop

00:06:07.816 --> 00:06:10.796
of rain coming at it,
I get it in such a way,

00:06:10.986 --> 00:06:12.746
and if I wait for a certain hour

00:06:12.746 --> 00:06:14.716
in which the sun is
glistening and then..."

00:06:14.826 --> 00:06:15.416
Who knows?

00:06:16.646 --> 00:06:17.336
May not be a filmmaker.

00:06:17.336 --> 00:06:22.006
May be a great painter, but
you'll find that they will learn.

00:06:22.766 --> 00:06:24.096
They will learn as they do it.

00:06:24.476 --> 00:06:28.716
At the same time, at the same
time, the respect for the language

00:06:28.716 --> 00:06:30.906
of cinema itself, the
history should be taught

00:06:31.346 --> 00:06:33.976
and the visual literacy should be
taught, because there are others

00:06:33.976 --> 00:06:34.946
who are not going to
be able to do that.

00:06:35.236 --> 00:06:37.126
There are others who can't
afford to get a camera,

00:06:37.316 --> 00:06:38.906
and this is one of the things.

00:06:38.906 --> 00:06:41.156
My-- where I came from, we
couldn't afford any 8 mm cameras

00:06:41.156 --> 00:06:41.626
or anything like that.

00:06:41.626 --> 00:06:42.376
I drew pictures.

00:06:43.666 --> 00:06:45.466
I imagined that they
moved, but I drew them.

00:06:48.236 --> 00:06:52.536
&gt;&gt;Scorsese: You know, violence is
an all-- is an encompassing word.

00:06:52.756 --> 00:06:55.996
It's a word that takes in so much.

00:06:56.126 --> 00:06:57.736
It depends on the world
you're depicting.

00:06:58.296 --> 00:06:59.836
It depends on the audience
you're aiming for,

00:07:00.536 --> 00:07:06.016
and then there's the issue of
your responsibility to the story

00:07:06.016 --> 00:07:08.176
and to the world that you're
depicting, and if you're going to go

00:07:08.176 --> 00:07:13.286
on a realistic basis, let's
say, where a world I came from,

00:07:13.286 --> 00:07:20.476
although is good, hardworking people
trying to raise a family respectably,

00:07:20.956 --> 00:07:22.776
there was a lot of organized
crime, and I saw a lot

00:07:22.776 --> 00:07:23.626
of violence where I grew up.

00:07:23.676 --> 00:07:24.836
I just saw it.

00:07:24.836 --> 00:07:27.016
It was part of me.

00:07:27.436 --> 00:07:31.086
When it came time for
me to make movies,

00:07:31.086 --> 00:07:32.366
I knew those films
were not for children.

00:07:33.566 --> 00:07:36.176
That was a time before-- that was
a time with the rating system,

00:07:36.176 --> 00:07:38.796
but it was before cable television.

00:07:39.886 --> 00:07:41.446
I knew those films would
never be shown on television,

00:07:42.376 --> 00:07:44.326
and if they were, they'd
be edited to the point

00:07:44.326 --> 00:07:47.096
where they were unintelligible
and I couldn't care less,

00:07:47.266 --> 00:07:49.646
because I wouldn't want them shown at
six o'clock at night or eight o'clock

00:07:49.646 --> 00:07:51.776
at night for a child of mine to see.

00:07:52.046 --> 00:07:56.266
The violence that I have in my
pictures and again, you know,

00:07:56.266 --> 00:07:58.116
be self-criticized,
people say sure, you know,

00:07:58.116 --> 00:08:00.196
"The kind of violence you
do, you think is alright,

00:08:00.196 --> 00:08:02.316
but for anybody else who does
it, you're criticizing them."

00:08:02.316 --> 00:08:03.836
But when we're talking
about the violence

00:08:03.836 --> 00:08:05.066
in my films, it's not pleasant.

00:08:05.876 --> 00:08:09.586
It's not pleasant, and I've
just finished a film, now.

00:08:09.586 --> 00:08:11.396
I'm working on this film right
now, which is very violent.

00:08:11.576 --> 00:08:12.676
And it's not pleasant at all.

00:08:13.106 --> 00:08:20.726
And it's not-- you reap what you sow
in the stories I'm trying to tell,

00:08:21.206 --> 00:08:24.026
and I don't know any
other way to show it.

00:08:24.026 --> 00:08:28.266
And it-- and there's also to deal
with the very, very dangerous aspect

00:08:29.036 --> 00:08:33.946
of that adrenaline one has as young

00:08:34.166 --> 00:08:39.956
that could be expressed many
different ways and some sort

00:08:40.086 --> 00:08:43.576
of excitement, whether it's sexual
excitement or violence or whatever,

00:08:43.576 --> 00:08:45.366
there's that danger
that one has to know.

00:08:45.366 --> 00:08:46.586
That's part of what
it is being human,

00:08:46.586 --> 00:08:48.626
especially young, and
that could go wrong.

00:08:48.976 --> 00:08:50.306
And when it goes wrong,
this could happen.

00:08:51.166 --> 00:08:54.416
Now, the world I came from,
the world I knew, or aspects,

00:08:54.416 --> 00:08:55.236
I should say of the world I knew,

00:08:55.236 --> 00:08:57.886
a lot of times was a
valid form of expression.

00:08:57.886 --> 00:08:59.916
That's the world I'm--
that's the world I'm--

00:09:00.916 --> 00:09:01.936
that's the human condition.

00:09:02.486 --> 00:09:07.346
That is the human condition, and it's
tragic and it's set up in such a way

00:09:07.346 --> 00:09:10.796
that will-- it will do us in as a
species, if we don't learn about it.

00:09:10.796 --> 00:09:14.266
I don't put it up there for
people to enjoy it, you know?

00:09:14.266 --> 00:09:16.766
And if they are enjoying it, they
catch themselves enjoying it,

00:09:18.036 --> 00:09:20.076
and the characters pay for it.

00:09:20.566 --> 00:09:22.896
Watch the characters pay for
it, particularly in "Goodfellas"

00:09:23.476 --> 00:09:28.366
and in "Raging Bull", in
this film, "The Departed",

00:09:28.366 --> 00:09:29.386
which I just finished also.

00:09:32.296 --> 00:09:34.606
&gt;&gt;Scorsese: Well, I think you have
to make room for film in curriculum.

00:09:34.606 --> 00:09:37.236
I don't think it's time, and I
don't-- and this is a key thing,

00:09:37.546 --> 00:09:42.506
we don't mean to be having young
people take two hours of their time

00:09:42.916 --> 00:09:45.926
or three hours of their time a week
or however the curriculum works

00:09:45.926 --> 00:09:48.436
to just sit and enjoy a movie.

00:09:48.896 --> 00:09:51.746
No. This is a learning experience.

00:09:52.136 --> 00:09:54.586
That also doesn't mean that you
take a notebook and you write

00:09:54.586 --> 00:09:55.996
down everything in the notes
as you're watching the film,

00:09:55.996 --> 00:09:57.716
because you can't see the film.

00:09:57.896 --> 00:10:03.366
So, what you're doing is training
the eye and the heart of the student

00:10:04.166 --> 00:10:07.026
to look at a film in a different
way by asking questions and pointing

00:10:07.476 --> 00:10:11.706
to different ideas, different
concepts, suggestions.

00:10:12.006 --> 00:10:16.156
You're training them to think
about a story that's told to you

00:10:16.156 --> 00:10:20.676
in visual terms in a different
way and to take it seriously.

00:10:21.206 --> 00:10:22.366
I don't say it's a great film.

00:10:23.356 --> 00:10:29.086
You can learn more from even a
bad film, you know, and so, uh..

00:10:29.086 --> 00:10:32.176
this is why it's so important,
I think, because so much in--

00:10:32.176 --> 00:10:35.986
of today's society is done
visually and even subliminally

00:10:36.626 --> 00:10:38.116
for young people that
it could be dangerous,

00:10:38.606 --> 00:10:40.586
and one has to know it's a
very, very powerful tool.
