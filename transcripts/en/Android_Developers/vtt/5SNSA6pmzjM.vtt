NAZMUL IDRIS: Welcome
to this episode of UXD,

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:11.620
where we will talk
more about Lean UX

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:13.850
and how to measure
changes in user behavior

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:16.980
to determine whether your design
decisions were good or bad.

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.950
I'm your host Nazmul
Idris, a develop advocate

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:20.454
passionate about
design and mobile.

00:00:20.454 --> 00:00:22.870
And I have a very special guest
with me on the show today.

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:24.244
LAURA KLEIN: Hi,
I'm Laura Klein.

00:00:24.244 --> 00:00:26.392
I'm a user experience
designer who loves data.

00:00:26.392 --> 00:00:27.350
Thanks for inviting me.

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:29.349
NAZMUL IDRIS: You're most
welcome, and thank you

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:30.000
for being here.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.729
So Lean UX is a way
to apply the methods

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:34.480
of learning as
quickly as possible

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.340
and reducing the cycle
time through what's

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.980
called the build
measure, and learn loop

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.160
to the process of user
experience design.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.720
Now, practicing Lean UX
means that you're always

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.060
validating with users, that
you're designing something

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:47.544
that people will actually use.

00:00:47.544 --> 00:00:48.960
It's about designing
products that

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.332
are both usable and useful.

00:00:51.332 --> 00:00:53.040
Laura wrote a really
good book about this

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.650
called "UX for Lean Startups."

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:57.150
In this episode,
we're going to talk

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.360
about qualitative and
quantitative research, what

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.570
they are, how to use them,
and most importantly, why

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:03.790
to use them.

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:05.810
So Laura, why do
developers and designers

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.510
need to know different
types research?

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:10.386
What's that got to do
with building products?

00:01:10.386 --> 00:01:12.135
LAURA KLEIN: That's
an excellent question.

00:01:12.135 --> 00:01:14.410
So research, both
qualitative and quantitative,

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:16.220
is the key to building
great products.

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.100
Without measuring the
results of our work

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.320
through things like
analytics, AB testing,

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.790
qualitative research, and
a host of other methods,

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:24.640
we really can't
understand the impact

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.825
that our changes are
having on end users.

00:01:26.825 --> 00:01:29.200
This means that we can't do
things like make good product

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.629
choices or learned from
any mistakes we might make.

00:01:31.629 --> 00:01:32.920
NAZMUL IDRIS: That makes sense.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.630
So these are just different
ways of measuring results.

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.635
So what is qualitative
research exactly?

00:01:38.635 --> 00:01:40.010
LAURA KLEIN:
Qualitative research

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:42.450
is about observing and
listening to people.

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.410
So it includes things like
usability testing, customer

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:47.630
development interviews,
and in-context studies

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.530
where you might
observe somebody using

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.510
a product in their
natural environment.

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:53.980
There are tons of types
of qualitative research.

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.410
But you can tell
research is qualitative

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:59.850
if it involves talking
to people or observing

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.027
real human behavior.

00:02:01.027 --> 00:02:01.860
NAZMUL IDRIS: I see.

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:02.670
That makes sense.

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.440
So now, these tests,
it doesn't sound

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.440
like they're statistically
significant, correct?

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.870
LAURA KLEIN: That's right.

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:07.645
They're not.

00:02:07.645 --> 00:02:08.353
NAZMUL IDRIS: Oh.

00:02:08.353 --> 00:02:09.190
So why do them?

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:10.350
What are they good for?

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:11.670
LAURA KLEIN: So they're
great for things

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.160
like understanding the
problem that you're

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.744
going to solve for
a user, or learning

00:02:14.744 --> 00:02:16.951
the context that your product
is going to be used in.

00:02:16.951 --> 00:02:18.590
They're also going
for building empathy

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.510
and for really understanding
the person that you're

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:22.710
building the product for.

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.590
NAZMUL IDRIS: Ah,
that makes sense.

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.120
So what about
quantitative research?

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.040
How is that different
than qualitative?

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.540
LAURA KLEIN: So
qualitative research

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.070
is often the preferred
method of engineers.

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.480
It includes things like
analytics, AB testing,

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:36.410
funnel metrics.

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.530
It's always statistically
significant,

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.315
and it never really
involves talking

00:02:40.315 --> 00:02:44.302
to humans, which might be why
it's so beloved of engineers.

00:02:44.302 --> 00:02:46.260
But quantitative research,
as the name implies,

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.580
is all about the data.

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:48.830
NAZMUL IDRIS: That make sense.

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:51.320
So I get to pick whichever
one I like, right?

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:52.250
LAURA KLEIN: No.

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:53.220
Sadly, you do not.

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.720
See, qual and quant do
really different things

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.230
about both your user
and your product.

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.420
As a general rule,
quantitative research

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.840
tells you exactly what is
happening with your product,

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.720
while qualitative research
tells you why it's happening.

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.284
So quant is what, qual is why.

00:03:08.284 --> 00:03:09.700
If you use both
of these together,

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.830
you get an enormous
amount of information

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:14.352
about both your
product and your users.

00:03:14.352 --> 00:03:16.060
And you can come up
with some great ideas

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.384
about how to make it better.

00:03:17.384 --> 00:03:18.675
NAZMUL IDRIS: That makes sense.

00:03:18.675 --> 00:03:19.466
That's really cool.

00:03:19.466 --> 00:03:21.840
So can you give me an example
of how they work together?

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:22.590
LAURA KLEIN: Yeah.

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.550
So let's imagine that
you have a product

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:26.690
and you're actually
charging people to use it.

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:27.482
NAZMUL IDRIS: What?

00:03:27.482 --> 00:03:28.314
LAURA KLEIN: I know.

00:03:28.314 --> 00:03:29.950
Crazy, but I thought
you might like it.

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.330
So at some point, you need
to actually put people

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:33.922
through a checkout
flow of some sort.

00:03:33.922 --> 00:03:34.630
NAZMUL IDRIS: Ah.

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:37.170
So you mean getting their
payment information, shipping

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:38.461
and billing address, and so on?

00:03:38.461 --> 00:03:40.290
LAURA KLEIN: Exactly.

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.420
So you can visualize your
checkout flow as a funnel.

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.620
Let's imagine that this
particular flow requires

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.670
all sorts of things,
that it requires people

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.370
to create an account,
select the plan they want,

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.610
enter their credit card
and address information,

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:53.590
confirm their purchase.

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.673
And then the final screen
is the thank you screen.

00:03:55.673 --> 00:03:58.530
So you want to measure not
just how many people make it

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.090
way through to the
thank you screen.

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:01.680
You also want to
measure the drop off

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.167
at each step of the funnel.

00:04:03.167 --> 00:04:04.250
NAZMUL IDRIS: Why is that?

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.625
LAURA KLEIN: Well, it gives
you more detailed information

00:04:06.625 --> 00:04:08.580
about where people
are getting stuck.

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:10.309
See, picture that funnel.

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:12.850
100% of the people who want to
buy your product or think they

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:15.250
want to buy your product
start at the first step.

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:18.029
And then let's say
you lose 20% there.

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:20.660
Then maybe you lose
10% at the next step.

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.120
And then 50% of the
remaining people drop

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.360
off at the next step, and then
maybe a third on the last step.

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.950
That means that only a small
percentage of the people who

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:31.740
started at the top
are actually getting

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.200
to the bottom of the funnel.

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.370
So if you start with
100 people, then you've

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:40.040
got 80, and then 72, and
then 36, and then 24.

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.360
And suddenly, only 24
people are actually

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.284
making it through to the end
and paying you for your product.

00:04:45.284 --> 00:04:47.450
But the nice thing about
knowing how many people you

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:50.010
lose at each step is that
you can use that information

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:53.030
to decide which step to
make changes to in order

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:54.917
to best increase
the number of people

00:04:54.917 --> 00:04:56.250
who make all the way to the end.

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:57.260
NAZMUL IDRIS: Ah, I see.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.468
So you might want to make
some changes, in this case,

00:04:59.468 --> 00:05:01.737
to step three, where you're
losing 50% of the people.

00:05:01.737 --> 00:05:02.820
LAURA KLEIN: That's right.

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:04.330
That's clearly a friction point.

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.390
But of course, at
this point, we just

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:08.880
know that people are
dropping off there.

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.050
We don't know why yet.

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:11.390
NAZMUL IDRIS: Can we just guess?

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:13.600
LAURA KLEIN: Well, we could.

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.420
But our guesses
would be a lot better

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:18.310
if we did some observational
user research to understand

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:20.290
whether there's a
specific problem

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:21.820
that people are
having on that step.

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:24.230
So for example, maybe there's
something really confusing.

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:26.100
Or maybe there's
some information

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:28.720
that people don't have
available to them on that step.

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:32.230
Or maybe the page just loads
really slowly for some people.

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:34.280
By observing five
or six people going

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:36.305
through that whole
checkout flow,

00:05:36.305 --> 00:05:38.930
you can start to make some much
better guesses about what you'd

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:40.469
want to fix on that step three.

00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:41.760
NAZMUL IDRIS: That makes sense.

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:43.820
So now let's say we know
what the problem is.

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:44.822
What do we do then?

00:05:44.822 --> 00:05:46.280
LAURA KLEIN: Well,
then you fix it.

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:48.930
Of course, if it involves
big changes to that step

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:50.790
or to the rest of
the flow, you want

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:52.580
to do some qualitative
usability research

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:53.674
while you're designing it.

00:05:53.674 --> 00:05:55.590
That can help make sure
that your next version

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:58.020
of the checkout flow doesn't
introduce new usability

00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:58.800
problems.

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.230
So when you're
pretty sure you've

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:02.146
got a good change to the
product, you build it

00:06:02.146 --> 00:06:02.739
and you ship.

00:06:02.739 --> 00:06:04.030
NAZMUL IDRIS: That makes sense.

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:05.988
LAURA KLEIN: But that's
not the end, of course.

00:06:05.988 --> 00:06:08.430
You still need to release
the fix it and AB test.

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:12.710
So AB testing is another form
of quantitative research.

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:14.810
This means that we can
validate that we've really

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:16.460
fixed the problem
that we had, and we

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:18.200
haven't introduced new ones.

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:19.410
NAZMUL IDRIS: Oh, I see.

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:21.390
So this way, we've
identified what

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:23.950
the problem is with
quantitative research.

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:24.700
LAURA KLEIN: Mmhm.

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:25.520
NAZMUL IDRIS: And
then we've got an idea

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:28.365
of why the problem is
happening with qualitative.

00:06:28.365 --> 00:06:31.390
But then we actually then
use qualitative research

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:33.720
to help design the
change and then confirm

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:36.430
that we fixed it with
quantitative again?

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:37.410
LAURA KLEIN: Exactly.

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:38.950
NAZMUL IDRIS: Wow, that's cool.

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:40.030
That makes sense.

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:41.780
So I'm going to play
devil's advocate now.

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:43.920
So I've heard that
it's not worth it

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:46.010
to do qualitative research,
because users really

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:47.093
don't know what they want.

00:06:47.093 --> 00:06:48.490
So asking them is useless.

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:49.270
Is that true?

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:51.170
LAURA KLEIN: Well,
I've heard that too.

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:53.150
And it's a fundamental
misunderstanding

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:55.840
of how to do good
qualitative user research.

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:57.840
So let's be totally clear.

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:00.040
If you're just asking
people what you should build

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:01.942
and then going and
building it, you're

00:07:01.942 --> 00:07:03.900
probably not going to
make a very good product.

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:05.635
That 100% true.

00:07:05.635 --> 00:07:07.530
But to be fair,
you're not actually

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:10.070
doing good qualitative research.

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:12.370
You're just outsourcing your
entire product development

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:13.570
process to your users.

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:14.540
And you know what?

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:18.400
They're probably not great at
designing fantastic products.

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.060
That's your job.

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:22.000
You're supposed to be
designing the product.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.987
So if you learn good quality
user research skills,

00:07:24.987 --> 00:07:27.570
you're going to be able to learn
a huge amount from your users

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:29.730
without ever once
asking that question.

00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:32.409
So what do you think
this product should do?

00:07:32.409 --> 00:07:33.700
NAZMUL IDRIS: That makes sense.

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:36.770
So now what about the argument
that you cannot make big design

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:39.540
changes will AB testing
and quantitative research?

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:40.610
I've heard that.

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:42.140
I mean, I've heard a lot
of designers say that.

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:43.320
LAURA KLEIN: Yeah, a
lot of them do say that.

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:45.570
And again, it's a
complete misunderstanding,

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:47.570
this time of
quantitative research.

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:50.810
See, remember analytics,
AB testing, funnel metrics?

00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:52.770
Those are just tools.

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:54.050
They're hammers.

00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:56.999
You can test anything you
want using these tools.

00:07:56.999 --> 00:07:58.540
The fact that you're
doing AB testing

00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:00.740
doesn't dictate
what you can test.

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:04.770
I mean, you could test button
colors or 42 shades of blue

00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:07.350
or whatever you want, all
sorts of little optimizations

00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:08.160
like that.

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:10.690
But you can also test
entirely different flows

00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:12.040
against one another.

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:14.400
You can test how
user's behave when

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:16.800
they have a new feature
against how they behave when

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:18.330
they don't have the new future.

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:20.620
AB testing isn't just
for optimization.

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:23.290
It's a marvelous tool for
understanding the real impact

00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:25.592
that your design changes
are having on the end user.

00:08:25.592 --> 00:08:27.050
NAZMUL IDRIS: Oh,
that makes sense.

00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:29.820
So it sounds like using
quantitative and qualitative

00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:33.064
together is more powerful than
just using each one by itself.

00:08:33.064 --> 00:08:34.480
LAURA KLEIN: That's
exactly right.

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:35.771
NAZMUL IDRIS: That makes sense.

00:08:35.771 --> 00:08:38.116
So that's all we
have time for today.

00:08:38.116 --> 00:08:39.990
If you'd like to learn
more about qualitative

00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:41.500
and quantitative
research methods,

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:44.240
please check out Laura's
book, "UX for Lean Startups."

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:45.230
It's amazing.

00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:46.980
It has a lot of tips
and tactics for doing

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:49.264
the right kind of research
at the right time.

00:08:49.264 --> 00:08:50.930
