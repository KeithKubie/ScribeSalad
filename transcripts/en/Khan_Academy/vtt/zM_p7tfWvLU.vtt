00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.490
 

00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:03.840
In this video, I want to do a
bunch of examples involving

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.200
exponent properties.

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.860
But, before I even do that,
let's have a little bit of a

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:10.970
review of what an exponent
even is.

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:15.380
So let's say I had 2
to the third power.

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:17.630
You might be tempted to
say, oh is that 6?

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.010
And I would say no,
it is not 6.

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.580
This means 2 times itself,
three times.

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.940
So this is going to be equal to
2 times 2 times 2, which is

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.549
equal to 2 times 2 is 4.

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:35.220
4 times 2 is equal to 8.

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:40.090
If I were to ask you what 3 to
the second power is, or 3

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:45.110
squared, this is equal to 3
times itself two times.

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.220
This is equal to 3 times 3.

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.030
Which is equal to 9.

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:51.060
Let's do one more of these.

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:54.080
I think you're getting the
general sense, if you've never

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.080
seen these before.

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:03.020
Let's say I have 5 to
the seventh power.

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.120
That's equal to 5 times
itself, seven times.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:16.280
5 times 5 times 5 times 5
times 5 times 5 times 5.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.960
That's seven, right?

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.200
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.560
This is going to be a really,
really, really, really, large

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.710
number and I'm not going to
calculate it right now.

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.470
If you want to do it by hand,
feel free to do so.

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:28.620
Or use a calculator, but this
is a really, really, really,

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:29.320
large number.

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.400
So one thing that you might
appreciate very quickly is

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.000
that exponents increase
very rapidly.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.700
5 to the 17th would be even a
way, way more massive number.

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.920
But anyway, that's a review
of exponents.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:47.130
Let's get a little bit steeped
in algebra, using exponents.

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.610
So what would 3x-- let me do
this in a different color--

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:59.670
what would 3x times
3x times 3x be?

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.340
Well, one thing you need to
remember about multiplication

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.990
is, it doesn't matter what
order you do the

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:06.060
multiplication in.

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.440
So this is going to be the same
thing as 3 times 3 times

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:16.550
3 times x times x times x.

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.620
And just based on what we
reviewed just here, that part

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.160
right there, 3 times 3,
three times, that's 3

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.780
to the third power.

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.210
And this right here, x times
itself three times.

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.750
that's x to the third power.

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.050
So this whole thing can be
rewritten as 3 to the third

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:37.570
times x to the third.

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.960
Or if you know what 3 to the
third is, this is 9 times 3,

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.240
which is 27.

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:46.180
This is 27 x to the
third power.

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.840
Now you might have said, hey,
wasn't 3x times 3x times 3x.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.830
Wasn't that 3x to
the third power?

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:53.140
Right?

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.480
You're multiplying 3x times
itself three times.

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.560
And I would say, yes it is.

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:03.210
So this, right here, you could
interpret that as 3x to the

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:04.730
third power.

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.950
And just like that, we stumbled
on one of our

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:08.280
exponent properties.

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.290
Notice this.

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.600
When I have something times
something, and the whole thing

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.430
is to the third power, that
equals each of those things to

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.490
the third power times
each other.

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:21.290
So 3x to the third is the same
thing is 3 to the third times

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:27.860
x to the third, which is
27 to the third power.

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.730
Let's do a couple
more examples.

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:39.050
What if I were to ask you what
6 to the third times 6 to the

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:40.410
sixth power is?

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.860
And this is going to be a really
huge number, but I want

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:45.480
to write it as a power of 6.

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:50.290
Let me write the 6 to the sixth
in a different color.

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.460
6 to the third times 6 to the
sixth power, what is this

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:55.540
going to be equal to?

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.200
Well, 6 to the third, we
know that's 6 times

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.880
itself three times.

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.400
So it's 6 times 6 times 6.

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.440
And then that's going to be
times-- the times here is in

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.060
green, so I'll do it in green.

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.430
Maybe I'll make both
of them in orange.

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:15.990
That is going to be times
6 to the sixth power.

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:17.430
Well, what's 6 to
the sixth power?

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.540
That's 6 times itself
six times.

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:27.180
So, it's 6 times 6 times
6 times 6 times 6.

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.380
Then you get one
more, times 6.

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:31.620
So what is this whole
number going to be?

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.740
Well, this whole thing-- we're
multiplying 6 times itself--

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:35.560
how many times?

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.650
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven,

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:40.640
eight, nine times, right?

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:44.450
Three times here and then
another six times here.

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:47.450
So we're multiplying 6 times
itself nine times.

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:48.910
3 plus 6.

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:55.360
So this is equal to 6 to
the 3 plus 6 power or 6

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.100
to the ninth power.

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:58.650
And just like that,
we/ve stumbled on

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:01.130
another exponent property.

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:04.100
When we take exponents, in this
case, 6 to the third, the

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:05.760
number 6 is the base.

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:09.190
We're taking the base to
the exponent of 3.

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:11.900
When you have the same base,
and you're multiplying two

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:17.360
exponents with the same base,
you can add the exponents.

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.850
Let me do several more
examples of this.

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:23.020
Let's do it in magenta.

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:29.420
Let's say I had 2 squared times
2 to the fourth times 2

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:31.030
to the sixth.

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:33.840
Well, I have the same base
in all of these, so

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.340
I can add the exponents.

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:41.490
This is going to be equal to 2
to the 2 plus 4 plus 6, which

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:44.970
is equal to 2 to
the 12th power.

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:46.680
And hopefully that makes sense,
because this is going

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:51.440
to be 2 times itself two times,
2 times itself four

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:53.880
times, 2 times itself
six times.

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:56.000
When you multiply them all out,
it's going to be 2 times

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.350
itself, 12 times or 2
to the 12th power.

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:04.740
Let's do it in a little bit more
abstract way, using some

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:08.150
variables, but it's the
same exact idea.

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:14.570
What is x to the squared or x
squared times x to the fourth?

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:16.610
Well, we could use the property
we just learned.

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:19.060
We have the exact
same base, x.

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:22.300
So it's going to be x to
the 2 plus 4 power.

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:25.100
It's going to be x to
the sixth power.

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:29.380
And if you don't believe
me, what is x squared?

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:33.210
x squared is equal
to x times x.

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:37.110
And if you were going to
multiply that times x to the

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:41.630
fourth, you're multiplying it by
x times itself four times.

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:46.200
x times x times x times x.

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:49.560
So how many times are you now
multiplying x by itself?

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:53.470
Well, one, two, three, four,
five, six times.

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:56.280
x to the sixth power.

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:58.470
Let's do another one of these.

00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:02.280
The more examples you see,
I figure, the better.

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:05.760
So let's do the other
property, just to

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:06.590
mix and match it.

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:14.320
Let's say I have a to the third
to the fourth power.

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:16.610
So I'll tell you the property
here, and I'll show you why it

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:17.450
makes sense.

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:19.880
When you add something to an
exponent, and then you raise

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:22.680
that to an exponent, you can
multiply the exponents.

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:28.160
So this is going to be a to the
3 times 4 power or a to

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:30.020
the 12th power.

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:31.730
And why does that make sense?

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:35.340
Well this right here
is a to the third

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:36.820
times itself four times.

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:41.330
So this is equal to a to the
third times a to the third

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:45.300
times a to the third times
a to the third.

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:48.430
Well, we have the same base, so
we can add the exponents.

00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:52.620
So there's going to be a to
the 3 times 4, right?

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:57.910
This is equal to a to the 3
plus 3 plus 3 plus 3

00:07:57.910 --> 00:08:03.600
power, which is the same thing
is a the 3 times 4 power or a

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:05.010
to the 12th power.

00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:07.580
So just to review the properties
we've learned so

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:11.560
far in this video, besides
just a review of what an

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:19.830
exponent is, if I have x to the
a power times x to the b

00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:22.550
power, this is going
to be equal to x to

00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:25.120
the a plus b power.

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:27.950
We saw that right here.

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:30.615
x squared times x to the fourth
is equal to x to the

00:08:30.615 --> 00:08:32.490
sixth, 2 plus 4.

00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:39.500
We also saw that if I have x
times y to the a power, this

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:42.440
is the same thing is
x to the a power

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:44.680
times y to the a power.

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:46.810
We saw that early on
in this video.

00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:49.570
We saw that over here.

00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:53.000
3x to the third is the same
thing as 3 to the third times

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.130
x to the third.

00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:56.410
That's what this is
saying right here.

00:08:56.410 --> 00:09:00.460
3x to the third is the same
thing is 3 to the third times

00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:01.730
x to the third.

00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:05.720
And then the last property,
which we just stumbled upon

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:10.710
is, if you have x to the a and
then you raise that to the bth

00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:15.430
power, that's equal to
x to the a times b.

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:18.460
And we saw that right there. a
to the third and then raise

00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:21.690
that to the fourth power is the
same thing is a to the 3

00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:25.280
times 4 or a to the
12th power.

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:32.970
So let's use these properties
to do a handful of more

00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:48.070
complex problems. Let's say
we have 2xy squared times

00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:55.060
negative x squared
y squared times

00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:57.900
three x squared y squared.

00:09:57.900 --> 00:09:59.330
And we wanted to
simplify this.

00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:04.980
 

00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:07.550
This you can view as
negative 1 times x

00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:08.930
squared times y squared.

00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:13.350
So if we take this whole thing
to the squared power, this is

00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:15.670
like raising each of these
to the second power.

00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:19.590
So this part right here could
be simplified as negative 1

00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:26.320
squared times x squared squared,
times y squared.

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:28.270
And then if we were to simplify
that, negative 1

00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:31.890
squared is just 1, x squared
squared-- remember you can

00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:35.100
just multiply the exponents-- so
that's going to be x to the

00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:37.770
fourth y squared.

00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:40.345
That's what this middle
part simplifies to.

00:10:40.345 --> 00:10:43.760
And let's see if we can merge
it with the other parts.

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:47.410
The other parts, just to
remember, were 2 xy squared,

00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:51.350
and then 3x squared y squared.

00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:53.380
Well now we're just going ahead
and just straight up

00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:54.400
multiplying everything.

00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:56.710
And we learned in multiplication
that it doesn't

00:10:56.710 --> 00:10:58.860
matter which order you
multiply things in.

00:10:58.860 --> 00:10:59.930
So I can just rearrange.

00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:02.150
We're just going and multiplying
2 times x times y

00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:04.600
squared times x to the fourth
times y squared times 3 times

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:05.550
x squared times y squared.

00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:10.290
So I can rearrange this, and I
will rearrange it so that it's

00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:11.800
in a way that's easy
to simplify.

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:16.995
So I can multiply 2 times 3, and
then I can worry about the

00:11:16.995 --> 00:11:18.610
x terms.

00:11:18.610 --> 00:11:19.960
Let me do it in this color.

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:30.330
Then I have times x times x to
the fourth times x squared.

00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:36.080
And then I have to worry about
the y terms, times y squared

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:40.036
times another y squared times
another y squared.

00:11:40.036 --> 00:11:42.950
 

00:11:42.950 --> 00:11:44.600
And now what are
these equal to?

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:45.880
Well, 2 times 3.

00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:47.200
You knew how to do that.

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:49.330
That's equal to 6.

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:53.450
And what is x times x to the
fourth times x squared.

00:11:53.450 --> 00:11:56.310
Well, one thing to remember is
x is the same thing as x to

00:11:56.310 --> 00:11:57.340
the first power.

00:11:57.340 --> 00:12:00.480
Anything to the first power
is just that number.

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:03.130
So you know, 2 to the first
power is just 2.

00:12:03.130 --> 00:12:05.970
3 to the first power
is just 3.

00:12:05.970 --> 00:12:08.780
So what is this going
to be equal to?

00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:13.190
This is going to be equal to--
we have the same base, x.

00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:19.760
We can add the exponents, x to
the 1 plus 4 plus 2 power, and

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:21.250
I'll add it in the next step.

00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:25.510
And then on the y's, this
is times y to the 2

00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:28.100
plus 2 plus 2 power.

00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:29.120
And what does that give us?

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:36.840
That gives us 6 x to the
seventh power, y

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:39.250
to the sixth power.

00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:41.310
And I'll just leave you with
some thing that you might

00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:43.290
already know, but it's
pretty interesting.

00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:44.900
And that's the question of what
happens when you take

00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:46.710
something to the zeroth power?

00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:50.360
So if I say 7 to the zeroth
power, What does that equal?

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:52.350
And I'll tell you right now--
and this might seem very

00:12:52.350 --> 00:12:56.820
counterintuitive-- this is equal
to 1, or 1 to the zeroth

00:12:56.820 --> 00:12:58.740
power is also equal to 1.

00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:01.600
Anything that the zeroth power,
any non-zero number to

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:06.060
the zero power is going
to be equal to 1.

00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:07.230
And just to give you
a little bit of

00:13:07.230 --> 00:13:09.320
intuition on why that is.

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:12.460
Think about it this way.

00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:17.100
3 to the first power-- let me
write the powers-- 3 to the

00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:19.260
first, second, third.

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:23.800
We'll just do it the
with the number 3.

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:25.420
So 3 to the first power is 3.

00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:26.340
I think that makes sense.

00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:28.760
3 to the second power is 9.

00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:31.610
3 to the third power is 27.

00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:33.590
And of course, we're trying to
figure out what should 3 to

00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:35.700
the zeroth power be?

00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:36.410
Well, think about it.

00:13:36.410 --> 00:13:39.040
Every time you decrement
the exponent.

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:41.680
Every time you take the exponent
down by 1, you are

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:43.160
dividing by 3.

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:45.640
To go from 27 to 9,
you divide by 3.

00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:48.000
To go from 9 to 3,
you divide by 3.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.400
So to go from this exponent to
that exponent, maybe we should

00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:51.630
divide by 3 again.

00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:54.950
And that's why, anything to
the zeroth power, in this

00:13:54.950 --> 00:13:58.050
case, 3 to the zeroth
power is 1.

00:13:58.050 --> 00:13:59.940
See you in the next video.
