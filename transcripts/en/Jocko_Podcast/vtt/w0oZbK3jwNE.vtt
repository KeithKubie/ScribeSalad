1
00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:03.193
Dear Bill.

2
00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:09.790
Today is February 13th,
1984

3
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
I came to this black wall again to see and touch your name.

4
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:21.593
And as I do,

5
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.790
I'm wondering if anyone ever stops to realize that next to your name on this

6
00:00:26.791 --> 00:00:30.450
black wall
is your mother's heart

7
00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.770
heartbroken.
15 years ago today

8
00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.810
when you lost your life in Vietnam.

9
00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.160
And as I look at your name,

10
00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.150
William are stocks.

11
00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.270
I think of how many,

12
00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.070
many times I used to wonder how scared and homesick you must have been in that

13
00:00:59.071 --> 00:01:00.840
strange country called Vietnam,

14
00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:07.190
NDF and how it might've changed you

15
00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.940
for you were the most happy go lucky kid in the world,

16
00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.270
hardly ever sad around happy.

17
00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.060
And until the day I die,

18
00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.060
I will see you as you laughed at me even when I was very mad at you.

19
00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.210
And the next thing I knew
we were laughing together.

20
00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.050
But on this past new year's Day,
I had my answer.

21
00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.380
I talked by phone to a friend of yours from Michigan who spent your last

22
00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.780
Christmas in the last four months of your life with you.

23
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.120
Jim told me how you died.

24
00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.790
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

25
00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.520
<v 1>but he was there.
And saw the helicopter crash.</v>

26
00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:00.440
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

27
00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:05.440
<v 1>He told me how you had flown your quota and it not been scheduled to fly that</v>

28
00:02:05.931 --> 00:02:06.764
day.

29
00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.280
How the regular pie that was unable to fly and had been replaced by someone with

30
00:02:12.281 --> 00:02:13.330
less experience,

31
00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.010
how they did not know the exact cause of the crash,

32
00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:26.240
how it was either hit by enemy fire or that they hit a pole or something unknown

33
00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.810
how the blades went through the chopper
and hit you

34
00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.550
power.
You lived about a half hour,

35
00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.860
but we're unconscious and therefore did not suffer.

36
00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.960
He said how your jobs were like sitting ducks.

37
00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.920
They would send you men out to draw the enemy into the open and then they would

38
00:02:59.561 --> 00:03:02.890
send in the big guns and planes to take over.

39
00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.300
Meantime,
death came to so many of you.

40
00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.870
He told me how after a while over there instead of a yellow streak,

41
00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.110
the men got a mean streak down their backs

42
00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.960
each day the street got bigger than the men became meaner.

43
00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.900
Everyone but you bill.
He said,

44
00:03:36.901 --> 00:03:41.700
how you stayed the same happy go lucky guy that you were when you arrived in

45
00:03:41.701 --> 00:03:42.534
Vietnam.

46
00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:47.480
How are your warmth and friendliness drew the guys to you?

47
00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:54.450
How your lieutenant gave you the nickname of spanky and soon your group,

48
00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.990
Jim included.
We're all known,
has Spanky's gang.

49
00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:06.770
How when you died it made it so much harder on them for you.

50
00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.210
Were there moral support?

51
00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.760
Can he said how you of all people

52
00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:18.200
should never have been the one to die?

53
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.480
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

54
00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:26.120
<v 1>Oh God.
How it hurts to write this,</v>

55
00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.610
but I must face it and then put it to rest.

56
00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.320
I know that after Jim talked to me,

57
00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:41.070
he must've relived it all over again and suffered.
So

58
00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:49.100
before I hung up the phone I told Jim I loved him.

59
00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:56.030
Love him for just being your close friend and for sharing the last days of your

60
00:04:56.311 --> 00:04:57.660
life with you

61
00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:02.460
and for being there with you when you died,

62
00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:07.830
how lucky you were to have him for a friend,

63
00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:12.830
like how lucky he was to have had you.

64
00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:24.520
Later that same day I received a phone call from a mother in billings,
Montana.

65
00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:30.400
She had lost her daughter,
her only child a year ago.

66
00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:37.220
She needed someone to talk to for no one would let her talk about the tragedy.

67
00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:43.330
She said she had seen me on television on New Year's Eve.

68
00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:47.560
After the Christmas letter I wrote to you and left at this memorial had drawn

69
00:05:47.561 --> 00:05:49.390
newspaper and television attention.

70
00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:55.970
She said she had been thinking about me all day and just had to talk to me.

71
00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:03.740
She talked to me of her pain and seemingly needed me to help her with it.

72
00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:11.960
I cried with this heartbroken mother and after I hung up the phone I laid my

73
00:06:12.511 --> 00:06:14.880
head down and cried as hard for her.

74
00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:21.900
Here was a mother calling me for help with her pain over the loss of her child,

75
00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:22.950
a grown daughter,

76
00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:27.480
and as I sobbed I thought,

77
00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:32.490
how can I help her with her pain when I have never completely been able to cope

78
00:06:32.491 --> 00:06:33.324
with my own?

79
00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:41.850
They tell me the letters I write to you and leave here at this memorial are

80
00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:46.600
waking others up to the fact that there is still much pain left after all these

81
00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:47.920
years from the Vietnam War.

82
00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:52.790
But this I know

83
00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:01.900
I would rather to have had you for 21 years and all the pain that goes with

84
00:07:02.301 --> 00:07:03.134
losing you

85
00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:09.200
the never to have had you at all.

86
00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:14.273
Mom

87
00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:24.480
Grand.

88
00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:29.480
That was a letter written by Mrs Eleanor when Bish Mother of Sergeant William R

89
00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:38.070
spanky stocks from Glen Burnie,
Maryland

90
00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:44.650
who was killed in action in a helicopter crash in Vietnam on February 13th,

91
00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:48.493
1969

92
00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:56.360
that letter was one of many that she has written and places beneath panel 32

93
00:07:59.010 --> 00:08:04.010
where his name is etched into the Vietnam memorial wall along with more than

94
00:08:04.171 --> 00:08:09.120
58,000 other names
of our fallen heroes.

95
00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:19.820
And I read an interview with Mrs [inaudible] from 1990

96
00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:25.970
and in that interview she said,
when my son died,

97
00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:31.150
I wrote my pledge.
I said,

98
00:08:31.151 --> 00:08:35.050
I will not now or ever let people forget.

99
00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:41.933
So

100
00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:46.440
for Mrs when Bish

101
00:08:48.390 --> 00:08:51.240
and her son Bill spanky stocks

102
00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:56.580
during this holiday season,

103
00:08:56.790 --> 00:08:59.100
<v 0>let us all remember,</v>

104
00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:07.800
<v 1>remember the service and supreme sacrifice of so many</v>

105
00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:15.930
and also

106
00:09:17.950 --> 00:09:22.950
let us learn some important lessons from Mrs. Wynn Besch and from her son.

107
00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:28.520
From Mrs [inaudible],

108
00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:33.300
we learn to be thankful for what we have had.

109
00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:34.920
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

110
00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:39.900
<v 1>Even if it is lost and even if that loss causes pain,</v>

111
00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:44.070
still
be thankful.

112
00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:49.140
And from her son Bill,

113
00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:53.790
we can learn that even in the face of horror and deaf,

114
00:09:56.590 --> 00:10:01.590
we can maintain our warmth and our friendliness and that that warmth and

115
00:10:02.621 --> 00:10:05.860
friendliness can guide and support others

116
00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:11.780
can help bolster the spirit of those around you

117
00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:17.260
<v 0>by simply
smiling.</v>

118
00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:23.163
So

119
00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:25.780
<v 1>as we celebrate the holidays,</v>

120
00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:27.530
<v 0>yeah.</v>

121
00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:29.480
<v 1>Let us be thankful for what we have.</v>

122
00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:36.690
And like Sergeant William,
Bill spanky stocks,

123
00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:40.553
keep smiling,

124
00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:47.810
have a merry Christmas
and a happy new year.
