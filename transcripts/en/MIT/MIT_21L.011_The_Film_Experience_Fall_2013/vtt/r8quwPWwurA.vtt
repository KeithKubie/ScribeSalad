DAVID THORBURN:
I'm David Thorburn.

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:10.100
I'm a Professor of Literature
and Comparative Media.

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.480
What else?

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:16.516
I've taught the film
experience for, I guess,

00:00:16.516 --> 00:00:20.590
38 or 39 years at MIT.

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.630
And I've taught a lot of
literature subjects as well.

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.030
The story of what made me into a
film scholar or a media scholar

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:32.400
is at least interesting to
me and still surprises me.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.780
I've told it a few times.

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.850
But it was actually a somewhat
transforming experience

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.030
in my life.

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.820
I had been teaching at Yale
for seven or eight years.

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.610
And I was offered a chance to do
a visitation at the University

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:49.690
of California in Santa Barbara.

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.060
And for the first
time in my life,

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:55.260
I was asked to
teach students who

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.140
weren't the product of very
elaborate private school

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.110
educations or very powerful
public school educations.

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:05.230
They were smart kids, but
they were less well-read

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:05.850
in some ways.

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.782
So I was trying to illustrate--
it was a literature

00:01:08.782 --> 00:01:10.240
course, Introduction
to Literature,

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.120
or Comedy, or
something like that.

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.070
And I was trying to
introduce the students

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.520
to the idea of
conventions, what it

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.130
means when you begin a
story, "once upon a time,"

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:23.610
and every story begins that way.

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.109
Or what it means
when you say, "they

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:27.910
lived happily ever after,"
to take the simplest example

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:29.740
of what a convention is.

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.440
I was trying to illustrate
how, in fact, we internalize

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.690
these things, and we understand
the narratives of our own time,

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.074
in our blood, without
even thinking about it.

00:01:40.074 --> 00:01:41.990
And I was trying to
illustrate this principle.

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.570
So what I needed to
illustrate the principle

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.790
were shared texts.

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.780
So I began by asking them--
this was in the 1970s,

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.850
in the early 1970s.

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:53.490
And I asked the
students there-- these

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.040
are bright California
public school

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.680
students-- how many of you have
ever seen a John Wayne movie?

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.840
Maybe 10% of the
students-- in 1970.

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.590
It's not 2016 now.

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.610
Maybe 15% of the students
raise their hand.

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.870
Then I said, well, how many of
you have read Huckleberry Finn?

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.640
Maybe 30%.

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.520
I tried other novels,
classic novels.

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.200
I tried Shakespeare plays.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.266
Finally, I said, how many of
you have seen All in the Family?

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.530
For those in the audience
too young to know this,

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.400
All in the Family was a
television program-- a classic

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.950
and transforming
one-- that appeared

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.000
in 1971 on American
television and involved

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.750
a working-class hero who had
never-- such characters had

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.320
never appeared on
television before.

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.700
It was a very important program.

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.740
And, of course, 100% of
the class had seen it.

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:53.520
And I began to take my examples
from television programs.

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.430
I talked about the conventions
of situation comedy

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.810
as a way of explaining.

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.210
And I began to think about this.

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:06.410
And this wore on me-- it wore
in on me as the term went on.

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.780
And what I realized was that
the literature of our own day,

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.200
the story forms that
belong to my students

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.610
and to the generation
of kids I was teaching,

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.390
were visual, not literary-- or
at least, many of them were.

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.940
And the ones that were shared
100%, shared by everyone,

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.400
was certainly televisual.

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.200
So I became interested
in television

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.330
as a narrative medium.

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.220
And then I came to
realize, as I began

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.880
to think more seriously
about the role of television

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.330
in American life-- remember, by
1970, American television was

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.040
deeply embedded
in American life.

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.270
It was the dominant form of
entertainment and narrative

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:42.480
in American life.

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.570
And in fact, this
initial understanding,

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:48.420
out of which my whole
interest in media developed,

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.170
has shaped-- I realize
now, just in talking

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:54.950
about this-- my way of
teaching the course,

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:56.710
the film experience--
and it's one

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:59.460
of the things I think that makes
the film experience unique.

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:01.550
Because I began thinking
about television.

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:02.710
I was not a film scholar.

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:03.840
I was not a media scholar.

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.310
I was a literary scholar.

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.460
In fact, ironically,
I was a specialist

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:09.960
in the high modern
period, a period of Joyce

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.730
and Virginia Woolf
and Picasso, right?

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:15.260
And I knew about
what we might think

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:19.459
of as-- I was an expert
in art-- in forms of art--

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:20.959
that could be thought
to be elitist,

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:24.070
or at least non-accessible
to the ordinary people.

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:27.260
And here I was confronting texts
that everyone could understand

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:28.630
and everyone shared.

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:30.460
We get to think about
them more deeply

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.020
and think more deeply about my
own literary education, which

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:36.020
was narrow in some sense.

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:38.820
As everyone in my
generation was so educated,

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:42.450
we were cut off from the
historical implications

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:43.900
of the texts we studied.

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:46.290
So I began to fill that
in as well, as I began

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:48.010
to learn more about television.

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:50.210
And what I realized,
thinking about television,

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:53.650
was I couldn't understand
television without the movies.

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:56.960
So I then set on a sort of
personal course of education,

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.260
and I read very deeply in movie
history and movie scholarship.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.210
And I amplified my own
knowledge of movies

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:07.400
tremendously by constant
viewing of movies,

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.710
mostly because I was trying
to understand television,

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:10.280
ironically.

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.530
And then I began to
develop a recognition

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:16.170
of what a remarkable cultural
phenomenon the movies were.

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:18.880
I began to generate great
respect for the great movie

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:20.360
scholars.

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.110
It was a great era, the
late '60s and early '70s,

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:25.920
for movie scholarship,
because it

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:27.910
had become mature by that time.

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:31.060
And the people writing movie
criticism in the United States,

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:34.700
certainly in the 1970s, were
very interesting critics.

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:36.230
Critics and scholars,
the equivalent

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:38.500
of the literary
scholarship that I

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:41.450
was used to, that I aspired
to write myself, and so forth.

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:43.530
So it was very exciting,
intellectually,

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:45.560
for me to have this experience.

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:49.000
When I got back to Yale,
after my year's visitation,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.520
I introduced a course called
Literature and Popular

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:55.580
Culture in which I explore
these ideas in greater depth

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:58.070
and with greater intensity.

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:00.310
I read some bestsellers.

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:04.250
I ended the course by
looking at The Honeymooners.

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:07.760
And I remember I was
teaching the course in a room

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:09.880
at Yale College called
Linsly-Chittenden

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:12.900
Hall, in which the great
Shakespeare lecture course had

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:14.620
been taught for generations.

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:17.090
And my course, Literature
in Popular Culture

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:18.750
was very popular
with the students.

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:21.070
I had a couple of
hundred students.

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:23.420
And I was lecturing
from the same podium

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:27.810
that legendary figures had
lectured on Shakespeare about.

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:29.790
And one of these
legendary professors,

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:31.170
the man who had
actually hired me

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:35.510
at Yale, Maynard Mack, a
great literary scholar,

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:39.570
poked his head in while I was
teaching The Honeymooners.

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:44.060
And I had actually dragooned
the medial people at Yale

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:46.700
to give me a reel-to-reel
tape recorder so I could

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:48.120
tape the stuff off the air.

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:52.070
Mack saw this and later
called me into his office

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:55.110
and expressed great
disappointment over the fact

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:58.800
that I was polluting
this environment.

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:01.710
So we then had a
serious conversation.

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:04.620
And I said to him, what
did he actually think

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:07.190
Shakespeare's environment was?

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:09.970
And that was when it struck
me how narrow my education had

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:10.470
been.

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:13.750
Because he really had not--
even though he was a great man--

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:15.260
he knew the history.

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:19.190
But he somehow had managed to
disconnect the literary power

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:21.570
of Shakespeare from
the fact that it

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:24.390
was done on this
incredibly popular stage,

00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:27.380
and it was so sensational,
and it was so much more

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:30.600
like television or
the movies than it

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:34.680
was like some process of
sitting in a library in wood

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:38.790
paneled splendor reading
words in silence-- that's

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:40.630
not what Shakespeare was.

00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:43.910
And that began to lead
me into recognitions

00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:46.150
of the importance of
popular culture, the fact

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:49.860
that most high culture was
a form of popular culture.

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:52.220
I became much less
apologetic than most teachers

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:54.240
of popular culture are.

00:07:54.240 --> 00:08:03.280
And so when I came to MIT in
the mid-- I came to MIT in 1976.

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:05.280
And I was already in
the throes of this.

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:08.340
But it was, I think, fortunate
for me and fortunate for MIT,

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:11.320
in one sense, because MIT's
literature program was much

00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:13.070
more open than Yale's had been.

00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:15.570
And they were interested in my
work on television and media.

00:08:15.570 --> 00:08:19.390
That was one reason they
wanted me to come here.

00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:23.220
And it was much less hidebound
about literary and historical

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:24.010
study here.

00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:27.120
So it gave me a chance to--
and I introduced a course

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:27.860
in television.

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:29.630
And that was one of
the very first courses

00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:33.780
in an the American Academy that
studied television programs

00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:34.970
for their content.

00:08:34.970 --> 00:08:35.830
Now, that's common.

00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:38.454
It's thought to be-- of course,
everybody takes it for granted.

00:08:38.454 --> 00:08:40.280
But at that time, it
was a very rare thing.

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:44.240
And what I also did was take
a course that I inherited from

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:46.780
my wonderful colleague--
still teaching here in his

00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:50.410
80's-- Alvin Kibel, a course
called the film experience

00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:54.470
which was of a course, that was
not intended for all students

00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:57.920
but a small one I transformed
it into a general introduction

00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:02.000
to film and I've taught it
almost every year since.
