00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:02.469
Fallout is everywhere, NO not the game.

00:00:02.469 --> 00:00:03.469
Or the Boy.

00:00:03.469 --> 00:00:04.469
Or…

00:00:04.469 --> 00:00:05.469
NO.

00:00:05.469 --> 00:00:10.030
Just the nuclear kind!

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:12.610
Seven blessings friends, Trace here for DNews.

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:15.960
Nuclear fallout is an inevitable side-effect
of nuclear disaster.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.391
When a nuclear weapon is detonated (or a nuclear
power plant has its worst day ever) radioactive

00:00:20.391 --> 00:00:23.950
dust is thrown into the atmosphere by the
explosive force.

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:28.600
Those radioactive particles then fall back
to Earth causing "nuclear fallout."

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.460
Nuclear fallout is no different than the ash,
dust, dirt, water, and other particulates

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.809
that would be thrown by any explosion, except
one key thing: it's all radioactive.

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:41.700
Fallout forms within minutes of a nuclear
explosion, and depending how high the particles

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.109
were propelled into the atmosphere, fallout
can be carried by the wind and spread far

00:00:46.109 --> 00:00:48.769
and wide from the original nuclear disaster!

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:49.879
How far?

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:51.050
All the far there is.

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:56.979
Before 1963, a handful of countries exploded
more than 500 nuclear weapons in Earth's atmosphere,

00:00:56.979 --> 00:01:00.839
blanketing the entire planet in low levels
of radioactive fallout.

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:01.839
But, don't worry!

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:07.189
When it comes to radiation it's about dosage,
and usually that dosage is low… but detectable.

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:11.920
A 12-year study called the "Baby Tooth Survey"
collected nearly 300,000 baby teeth from children

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:17.060
in the St. Louis area and found a 100-fold
increase of isotope "strontium-90, [that]

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.070
rose and fell in correlation with [those]
atomic bomb tests."

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.259
Again, super low dosage, but it was there.

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:27.979
So, how fallout can affect you depends on
when you were exposed and how.

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:32.729
All radioactive heavy elements decay, shooting
off tiny high-energy particles over time.

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.220
If those bits hit your DNA, they can damage
it, causing cancers.

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.450
This is why higher dosages are worse, because
there are more of those particles decaying,

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.140
causing more potential damage.

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.299
So, the closer to the nuclear disaster you
are, the more dangerous the fallout will be.

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:51.789
For example, according to the National Cancer
Institute and CDC, people living in the U.S.

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:59.069
from the 1945 to 1963 likely ingested radioactive
iodine-131 left from nuclear testing in the

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:03.600
American West and over the Pacific.10 After
the tests, the fallout particles blew over

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.069
the U.S., were trapped by moisture, and rained
down onto our fruits and vegetables.

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.610
Those were then consumed by goats and cows,
and the I-131 was passed into their milk.

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.340
Eventually, people drank it, and the isotope
lodged into human thyroids, decaying and occasionally

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.080
causing thyroid cancer.10 Another example
is the residents of Hiroshima and Nagasaki,

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.720
who were closely studied after World War II.

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.620
Researchers documented a late-life cancer
rate that was much higher than the global

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.770
population; things like bone and thyroid cancers,
tumors, and leukemia.

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:37.710
And this is still going on as people in Nevada,
New Mexico and elsewhere eat local food grown

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:40.590
in soil contaminated by radiation…

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:46.170
If Darwin-forbid something nuclear did happen
today, you could create a fallout shelter.

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.760
Radioactive particles are easily blocked by
things like… dirt.

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.450
According to FEMA, only a foot of concrete
or a foot and a half of dirt would cut radiation

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.730
dosages by 40 times.

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.260
But you don't have to stay in that shelter
as long as you think.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.510
The "Seven-Ten Rule" says for every factor
of seven hours the radioactivity decreases

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:03.510
by 10.

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:09.470
So seven hours after the explosion, it's 10-percent
as radioactive; at 49 hours (seven times seven)

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:14.240
it's only 1-percent of the original dosage;
and at 7 times 7 times 7 hours -- about two

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:18.690
weeks, it's only one tenth of one percent
of the original -- which is why FEMA says,

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.880
keep enough water and food for at least two
weeks!

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.360
The thing is, there is a weird benefit of
global radiation exposure…

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:31.530
The isotope plutonium-239 was released into
the world at exactly 5:30am on July 16, 1945.

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.990
Meaning, it's a good marker for scientists!

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:38.330
They've been using PL-239 to determine the
melting of ice caps and glaciers since its

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:40.150
introduction -- amongst other things!

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.220
So sometimes, destructive science can teach
us a lot.

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:44.850
Silver isotope lining?

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:48.970
So if nuclear fallout causing cancer is the
end of the line, where's the beginning?

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:50.450
How do we make nuclear fuel?

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:56.610
Don't worry, we made a super cool video about
that right here

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:12.160
Are you 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:13.230
afraid of fallout?

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:19.180
Even though it's around us all the time?
