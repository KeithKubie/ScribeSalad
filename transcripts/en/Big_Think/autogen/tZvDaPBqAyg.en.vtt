is the brains tendency to once you start
 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.230

initial hunch your brain naturally looks
 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.090
initial hunch your brain naturally looks
for information that confirms that

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100
for information that confirms that

primacy effect and basically what that

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190
primacy effect and basically what that
 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.190
primacy effect and basically what that
means is the information we learn first

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200
means is the information we learn first
 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.650

sometimes feel bad talking about that

sometimes feel bad talking about that
 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.560
sometimes feel bad talking about that
because I'd love to be the person that

not that important if anything what the

not that important if anything what the
 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.770
not that important if anything what the
science shows is that they're really

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780
science shows is that they're really
 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.570
science shows is that they're really
more important than you even think they

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580
more important than you even think they
 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.640
more important than you even think they
are because that first impression is

person other person gets about you will

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780
person other person gets about you will
 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.840
person other person gets about you will
have a really major effect on everything

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850
have a really major effect on everything
 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.539
have a really major effect on everything
else they see so for example if in your

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549
else they see so for example if in your
 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.160
else they see so for example if in your
initial encounter with someone you come

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170
initial encounter with someone you come
 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.210
initial encounter with someone you come
across as kind of a jerk and they you

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220
across as kind of a jerk and they you
 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.069
across as kind of a jerk and they you
know it you realize afterwards that you

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079
know it you realize afterwards that you
 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.210
know it you realize afterwards that you
didn't come across the way you intended

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220
didn't come across the way you intended
 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.890
didn't come across the way you intended
to and so the next day when you come in

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900
to and so the next day when you come in
 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.080
to and so the next day when you come in
to work let's say you bring them a cup

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090
to work let's say you bring them a cup
 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.760
to work let's say you bring them a cup
of coffee and you think well that'll be

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770
of coffee and you think well that'll be
 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.620
of coffee and you think well that'll be
nice too nice gesture it'll show them

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630
nice too nice gesture it'll show them
 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.390
nice too nice gesture it'll show them
that I'm not a jerk it's actually more

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400
that I'm not a jerk it's actually more
 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.710
that I'm not a jerk it's actually more
likely to happen is that they're going

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720
likely to happen is that they're going
 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.230
likely to happen is that they're going
to interpret the you giving them coffee

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240
to interpret the you giving them coffee
 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.319
to interpret the you giving them coffee
in with the lens of the understanding of

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329
in with the lens of the understanding of
 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:49.819
in with the lens of the understanding of
how you were a jerk before so they'll

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829
how you were a jerk before so they'll
 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.010
how you were a jerk before so they'll
say oh can you believe this jerk who's

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020
say oh can you believe this jerk who's
 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.810
say oh can you believe this jerk who's
trying to manipulate me but he thinks

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820
trying to manipulate me but he thinks
 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.490
trying to manipulate me but he thinks
just giving me some coffee is going to

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500
just giving me some coffee is going to
 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.770
just giving me some coffee is going to
somehow get me on his side right so

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780
somehow get me on his side right so
 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.870
somehow get me on his side right so
you'll feel manipulated by the gesture

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880
you'll feel manipulated by the gesture
 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.880
you'll feel manipulated by the gesture
they'll interpret the gesture in a way

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890
they'll interpret the gesture in a way
 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:02.990
they'll interpret the gesture in a way
that's consistent with what they already

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000
that's consistent with what they already
 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.940
that's consistent with what they already
think of you and that's really the

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950
think of you and that's really the
 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.459
think of you and that's really the
challenge now how do you get past

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469
challenge now how do you get past
 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.290
challenge now how do you get past
confirmation bias how do you get over

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300
confirmation bias how do you get over
 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.080
confirmation bias how do you get over
the primacy effect when let's say your

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090
the primacy effect when let's say your
 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.090
the primacy effect when let's say your
initial

and the hare ways of getting people to
update their impressions the tortoise
