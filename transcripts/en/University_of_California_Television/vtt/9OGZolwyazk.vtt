- [Narrator] We are the paradoxical ape:
bipedal, naked, large-brained. Long the

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:37.804
master of fire, tools and language, but
still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:37.804 --> 00:00:48.579
Aware that death is inevitable yet filled
with optimism. We grow up slowly. We

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:55.777
hand down knowledge, we empathize and
deceive. We shape the future from our

00:00:55.777 --> 00:01:02.776
shared understanding of the past. CARTA
brings together experts from diverse

00:01:02.776 --> 00:01:10.578
disciplines to exchange insights on who we
are and how we got here, an exploration

00:01:10.578 --> 00:01:14.827
made possible by the generosity of
humans like you.

- [Margaret] Welcome. We begin another
extremely interesting session with some

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:09.780
very promising speakers in front of me.
I'm Margaret Schoeninger, I'm co-director,

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.700
one of the co-directors, of CARTA and I
just, again, want to say welcome. For

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:20.780
CARTA, as the video was portraying, we're
very interested in the oldest questions of

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:27.090
humans. So what we're looking at is who
are we? What are we doing here? We all are

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:32.590
interested in in this. Where do we come
from? How did we get here? Where are we

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:38.440
going? But there're only really two
questions of that list that we can begin

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:46.810
to really address scientifically, really
collect data on them. So that's why CARTA

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:54.210
was formed. CARTA is anthropogeny and it
is trying to explain the origin of humans.

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:59.660
It's from an old dictionary saying, an
Oxford dictionary in 2006 actually put it

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:05.420
together came from 1839 and so we do
anything we can to try to understand the

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:11.160
origin of humans. We are a rather large
group at this point, we started very small

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.630
but we're a pretty large group now, with
three co-directors, one of whom is in

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:21.720
front of me, Professor Ajit Varki, Rusty
Gage was unable to join us. I see the

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.870
Associate Director here, Pascal Gagneux,
who actually was the voiceover in the

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.830
previous video. We have a management
services officer you're gonna see walking

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:34.740
around the room a lot, Linda Nelson.
Community relations director, I saw

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:40.540
walking all around, Ingrid, and she's
still working, Ingrid Benirschke-Perkins.

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.361
We have a computer programmer analyst

00:03:42.361 --> 00:03:44.967
who's taking care of all the
live streaming. That

00:03:44.967 --> 00:03:50.800
is Kate Kaya, program director Jesse
Robie and administrative assistant Stefi

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:57.250
Petit. I think you would get this from the
video but just in case you didn't we are

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:03.320
pulling together experts from multiple
fields all over. We add as we find an

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:08.410
interesting target, so we have people from
physical and chemical sciences, biomedical

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:13.800
sciences, social sciences all across
campus. We have a mission statement that

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:19.160
we will use all rational and ethical
approaches to seek verifiable facts from

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.560
all relevant disciplines to explore and
explain the origins of the human

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:29.480
phenomenon. We try to minimize complex
organizational structure and hierarchies

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:33.960
but, as I was talking to someone at lunch,
as we've gotten larger and larger that is

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:38.770
becoming more and more difficult. We try
to avoid unnecessary paperwork and

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:43.670
bureaucracy but it's very difficult to do
with a large organization as we are now.

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:48.820
In the process, we really are trying to
raise awareness and understanding of this

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:54.930
study of human origins within the academic
and also the public at large, which is why

00:04:54.930 --> 00:05:00.560
we do these large public presentations. In
order to do that, we have one

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:06.620
exceptionally wonderful sponsor, it is the
G. Harold and Layla Mathers charitable

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:11.590
foundation of New York with Jim Handelman,
who is the executive director, who often

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:17.529
comes but is not here today. This is going
to be video recorded with closed

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:24.216
captioning due to the generosity of Rita
Atkinson, Liz Lancaster, Eli Shefter and

00:05:24.216 --> 00:05:29.381
also Sue Rosner. And I want to thank
especially Annette Merle-Smith because

00:05:29.381 --> 00:05:34.332
there are some young people here and they
are here because of her generosity in

00:05:34.332 --> 00:05:40.088
providing support for some of our fellows
within our anthropogeny specialization

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:45.103
track. So thank you Annette. We have...
Yes, thank you Annette.

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:54.360
We have a number of individual sponsors
and we are grateful to each one of them. I

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:59.970
also want to thank UCSD-TV for the video
recording and some of the closed

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:03.788
captioning and Salk Media Services. We
wouldn't be here if it weren't for the

00:06:03.788 --> 00:06:10.323
Salk Media people. So in order to begin I
am going to turn this over to our

00:06:10.323 --> 00:06:15.919
co-chair, Steve Churchill, from Duke
University and let him begin. Thank you.
