By this point, you've had a bunch of practice with combining like terms. So,

00:00:04.657 --> 00:00:09.430
let's go back to that problem we were doing with Grant and his glasses wipers

00:00:09.442 --> 00:00:14.500
and nozzles. Here's the equation we had. a, the total amount of money he's going

00:00:14.512 --> 00:00:19.631
to earn from his friends buying his products is equal to 36w plus 51w plus 22 n

00:00:19.643 --> 00:00:24.161
plus 50 n. Last time you saw this, we didn't know how to combine like terms.

00:00:24.266 --> 00:00:28.716
But, now you do. So, in this box, I would like you to type the most simplified

00:00:28.728 --> 00:00:33.672
version of this entire equation that you can come up with. Remember, I'm looking

00:00:33.684 --> 00:00:38.288
for the whole equation, not just this expression. You need to include the a

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.274
equals in the equation down here.
