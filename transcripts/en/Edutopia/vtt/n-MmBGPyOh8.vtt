00:00:09.856 --> 00:00:13.136
&gt;&gt;It goes in this way, right?

00:00:13.256 --> 00:00:15.256
&gt;&gt;Dea: I like to take
APs and Honors a lot

00:00:15.256 --> 00:00:18.546
because it gives me
extra points on my GPA.

00:00:18.546 --> 00:00:21.696
I have Computer Science Programs
first period and Physiology

00:00:21.816 --> 00:00:24.436
for second, and third period
I have AP U.S. History.

00:00:24.656 --> 00:00:27.016
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Dea Flores is very busy.

00:00:27.016 --> 00:00:28.406
&gt;&gt;Dea: Fourth period
I have AP English.

00:00:28.406 --> 00:00:32.066
Fifth period I have Math Analysis,
and after school, I have track.

00:00:32.066 --> 00:00:33.926
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Instead of
going to her local school,

00:00:34.326 --> 00:00:38.606
Dea commutes across town to
Bravo Medical Magnet High School

00:00:38.606 --> 00:00:39.966
in East Los Angeles.

00:00:40.366 --> 00:00:41.586
&gt;&gt;Dea: I didn't want
to come to Bravo.

00:00:41.586 --> 00:00:42.946
I wanted to go to a different school.

00:00:43.376 --> 00:00:45.926
And my parents, they forced me
to come here, and I hated them

00:00:45.926 --> 00:00:47.696
for it for, like, a couple of months,

00:00:47.696 --> 00:00:50.256
but then I understood
they were right.

00:00:50.746 --> 00:00:54.816
As a Blue Ribbon School, it is a
very great educational program.

00:00:55.166 --> 00:00:56.646
&gt;&gt;Alan, you're my guinea pig?

00:00:56.646 --> 00:00:57.486
&gt;&gt;I'll be your guinea pig.

00:00:57.756 --> 00:00:59.616
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Dea is
excelling at Bravo.

00:01:00.056 --> 00:01:02.086
She recently designed an experiment

00:01:02.086 --> 00:01:06.106
for her physiology class
using biofeedback equipment

00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:07.096
and video games.

00:01:07.096 --> 00:01:09.176
&gt;&gt;Dea: Well, I came up with
the hypothesis that people

00:01:09.176 --> 00:01:12.496
who play video games more might
actually have a lower stress level

00:01:12.596 --> 00:01:13.526
than people who didn't.

00:01:14.406 --> 00:01:18.446
So I started asking people, "Do you
consider yourself a gamer or not,"

00:01:18.446 --> 00:01:19.466
and then I would test them.

00:01:19.536 --> 00:01:21.936
&gt;&gt;So this electrode is going to
be measuring your brain waves,

00:01:21.936 --> 00:01:23.326
so I'm going to put one
electrode on your forehead

00:01:23.326 --> 00:01:26.096
and one electrode on your ear.

00:01:26.096 --> 00:01:28.946
&gt;&gt;Dea: It was the same game on
the same device for every person.

00:01:28.946 --> 00:01:32.296
&gt;&gt;Alan was actually pretty stable
through the whole thing, I guess,

00:01:32.296 --> 00:01:35.406
because of his familiarity
with the game.

00:01:35.666 --> 00:01:39.336
Diana -- this is her practice
-- when she started hitting,

00:01:40.086 --> 00:01:42.316
her stress level would
start to go down.

00:01:42.486 --> 00:01:44.826
&gt;&gt;Dea: I gave my presentation
at the science fair,

00:01:44.826 --> 00:01:48.186
and I thought because I didn't
have a solid conclusion,

00:01:48.186 --> 00:01:50.276
it wasn't a valid experiment.

00:01:50.626 --> 00:01:51.696
It turns out, I guess it was.

00:01:52.156 --> 00:01:55.966
I got first place in the
category that I was placed in.

00:01:55.966 --> 00:01:58.766
&gt;&gt;Exercise can actually
reduce stress.

00:01:59.386 --> 00:01:59.726
&gt;&gt;Right.

00:02:00.096 --> 00:02:01.116
&gt;&gt;How could that work?

00:02:01.166 --> 00:02:03.776
&gt;&gt;Well, that's something I still
want to test because I still think

00:02:03.776 --> 00:02:06.336
that athletes will have
a lower stress level just

00:02:06.336 --> 00:02:08.966
because they have an
output for that stress.

00:02:09.956 --> 00:02:11.446
Luis: [Subtitles]

00:02:28.146 --> 00:02:29.766
&gt;&gt;Dea: They come to parent
conferences all the time.

00:02:29.936 --> 00:02:31.936
They take my grades very seriously.

00:02:31.936 --> 00:02:34.356
They were like, "You're very smart.

00:02:34.356 --> 00:02:35.846
You just underestimate yourself."

00:02:36.576 --> 00:02:37.936
&gt;&gt;See, it won't hit it.

00:02:37.936 --> 00:02:39.106
It doesn't reach.

00:02:39.306 --> 00:02:40.716
Something's wrong with the arm.

00:02:40.716 --> 00:02:49.766
&gt;&gt;Dea: I guess they
think I'm a good student.

00:02:50.206 --> 00:02:52.346
