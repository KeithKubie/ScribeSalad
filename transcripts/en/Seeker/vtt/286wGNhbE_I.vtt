00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.660
Ugh, my muscles… why do they feel so…
achey.

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:09.680
*cough* If you say more research is needed
I’m going to kick you.

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:15.990
Howdy sickos, I’m Trace, thanks for watching!

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.740
IT’S FLU SEASON EVERYBODY!

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:18.740
Congratulations.

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.760
If you didn’t get your flu shot this year
(or even if you did), here’s a warning:

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.150
YOU COULD GET SICK.

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.480
No one exactly knows why influenza viruses
hit in the colder months.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.469
They may survive and circulate better in cold,
dry air;l our immune systems may be weaker

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:37.519
thanks to a lack of sunlight in the winter
or; perhaps, it’s simply because thanks

00:00:37.519 --> 00:00:41.829
to the cold we spend more time in close quarters,
and thus, spread the virus more easily.

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:45.530
Once you’ve got the flu, however, chances
are you’ll get some of the symptoms: fever,

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.809
headaches, sore throat, runny nose, muscle
aches and so on!

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.469
The thing is, I get fevers and headaches (your
hypothalamus raises your body temperature

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:57.319
to make viruses less comfortable, and the
heat causes dilation of vessels in your brain

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:58.639
adding pressure).

00:00:58.639 --> 00:01:04.220
I also get runny noses and sore throats (your
nose is pushing mucus like crazy to wash pathogens

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.880
away from the body, and the back of the throat
is popular for infectious colonies, and immune

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.870
cells rush to the area, inflaming it and causing
pain).

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:17.009
Fun fact: 90 percent of sore throats are caused
by viruses, not bacteria; which means only

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.750
10 percent of the time will antibiotics help
you; that said, those bacterial sore throats

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.070
are serious!

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:29.090
Basically, most of your symptoms aren’t
the flu, but the immune response -- and muscle

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:30.740
and joint pain is the same.

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.840
If you’re thinking, damn, my immune system
is causing all this terribleness, you’re

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:35.840
not alone.

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.170
We’re all right there with you.

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.750
The immune system is the last line of defense
so it doesn’t really do half-measures.

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:43.530
It just POW!

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:44.530
GETS AT IT.

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.960
Anyway, you’ve probably guessed by now,
but muscle aches are thanks to the immune

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.579
system too, but in a much cooler way.

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.890
Muscle aches are called myalgia, and in studies,
as many as 94-percent of people with the flu

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:55.890
get them.

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.969
The immune system’s army contains a variety
of cells, but when it comes to these myalgic

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:03.319
issues we really only care about a few….

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:07.329
Let’s say the immune system corners some
virus in your thigh muscle.

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:12.250
The antibody narcs show up, and bind with
the virus, tagging it for attack and keeping

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.100
it from infecting other cells.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.390
Once the virus is tagged, histamine shows
up -- it’s is part of our allergic reaction

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:19.390
system.

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.390
The histamine dilates the vessels in the area,
and gets them ready for the big guns… the

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.780
macrophages (a.k.a the famous white blood
cells)!

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.410
These macrophages get in there and start eating
and attacking the tagged pathogens, and try

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.810
to eat any infected cells.

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.480
The thing is, thanks to studies done on patients
with arthritis, we know macrophages tend to

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.640
leave behind chemicals which aren’t super
comfortable.

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.220
Cytokines are a family of proteins secreted
by immune system cells.

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.560
During influenza attacks, one, called interleukin-6
(IL-6) is all over.

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.930
IL-6 is associated with inflammation and causes
soreness.

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.310
So, when the white blood cells show up, they
ravage the area, and leave the IL-6 in their

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.860
wake, which your body has to clean up.

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:07.310
There’s not much you can do about muscle
and joint aches, except give them a rest.

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.970
Some people massage their achy joints and
muscles, some use warm blankets… fluids

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:13.010
always help.

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.310
But if you’re really concerned ask your
doctor… we’re not specialists.

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.460
Here’s something to contemplate while you’re
laying in your bed hating your own immune

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:22.160
system for making you feel so bad.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.820
One: Evolution may have created the pain,
inflammation and whatnot to keep you from

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:31.540
spreading the sickness to others, and to force
you to rest so your body can fight the infection.

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:32.540
Cool, right?

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.460
And Two: influenza has been part of the human
experience since before history was history.

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:42.090
In fact, it was first described by the father
of western medicine, Hippocrates, in 412 BCE!

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.090
If anything?

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:46.200
You’re just participating in the grand tapestry
of human suffering.

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.170
Congratulations no go make a hot tea.

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.400
After all that, I hope you got your flu shot.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.430
You should watch this video to figure why
you should have done it.

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:54.890
But if you didn't, tell us about it in the
comments.

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:56.290
Why didn't you get that shot?

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.710
Please subscribe for more DNews and thanks
for watching.

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:59.940
I forgot to get my flu shot...
