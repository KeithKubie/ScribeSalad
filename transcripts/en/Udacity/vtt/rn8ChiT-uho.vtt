00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.700
As you can see, developers get really

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:04.290
excited about Salesforce. And we're really excited to

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.120
teach this course. I started working at Salesforce

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.170
six years ago. And while I was initially

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:11.360
excited to be working for the undisputed leader

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.760
in cloud computing, what really got me excited

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:16.410
was working on the platform, and the limitless

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.160
possibilities of what you can build on Salesforce.

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.760
&gt;&gt; And I don't work at Sales Force. I work

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.280
Udacity, because I like teaching people things. Things that will

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.335
help them improve their life. And I think if you learn

00:00:28.335 --> 00:00:32.009
Salesforce, you actually can get a job, and that's pretty cool.

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.380
&gt;&gt; When I started working at Salesforce,

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:35.330
three years ago, what really intrigued me about

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:39.040
the platform was just how easy it was to build apps on it. you have

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.210
a lot of free range as a developer to build whatever you want with code.

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.980
You can do so much with just

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.190
point and click. It's a really interesting platform.
