00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.340
Okay, so we just looked at using a scalar value in our query

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:07.780
document for an array value field. Let's look at another way we can

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:12.440
query arrays in MongoDB. In this case we're going to introduce the IN

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.098
operator. Let's take a look at an example, and then we'll talk about it.

00:00:15.098 --> 00:00:16.604
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:00:16.604 --> 00:00:19.076
Okay, so what happened there? IN allows us to specify an

00:00:19.076 --> 00:00:23.380
array of values. In this query then, we'll retrieve all documents

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.580
for which the model years field contains any of the values

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.390
in this array here. We can use IN even if the

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.980
field we're querying against is not an array valued field. Thus

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.240
giving us a number of optional values that will match documents

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.440
in our result set. So we can see as I add

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.550
additional values to this array of options, that our count gets

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.820
larger and larger. Because we have a larger

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.780
and larger target that we can hit. K,

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.840
so let's take a look at the actual documents that are retrieved her. K, and if

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:55.710
we scroll up, we can see that in fact this document matches, as do the rest.

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.980
All of them containing at least one of

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.510
the values in their model year that we specified.
