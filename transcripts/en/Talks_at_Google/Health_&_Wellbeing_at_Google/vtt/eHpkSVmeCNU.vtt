MILA BERNABO: Please join
me in welcoming Poppy.

00:00:08.175 --> 00:00:09.660
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:12.135 --> 00:00:16.430
POPPY JAMIE: OK, Hi, everyone.

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:18.770
First of all, just
thank you for having me.

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:23.080
It is such an honor
be talking at Google.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.210
And even more
exciting because you

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:29.380
guys are the first ever
to experience and have

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.600
a sneak preview of
the Happy Not Perfect

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.350
app on Android, which will
be launching this week

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.250
as a live beta on Google Play
in light of Mental Health

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.380
Awareness Week.

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:45.100
So yesterday, I began to think--

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.850
it's funny-- I'm about to
speak to some of the smartest

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.900
people in the entire world who
dedicate their time, expertise,

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:58.120
and talent into making our
technological experiences

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.650
amazing.

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:03.790
The care and attention put in
means our devices constantly

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:08.920
improve, amaze, and delight us,
and quickly adapt to our needs.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.830
That care and attention
carries through from developer

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:13.190
to the consumer.

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.240
I know if I don't charge
my phone, it will die.

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.240
When a new update comes
out, I immediately

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.240
spend time upgrading
and look in awe

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.760
at new features and functions.

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.170
But when thinking about this,
I thought, isn't it odd?

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.430
We clearly all understand
the basic concept

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.680
that care, time,
and attention is

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.270
needed to make anything better.

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.500
But most of us are not
willing to apply this concept

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:47.350
to the most, most important
hardware that exists--

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.240
our minds.

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.850
Unlike our
technological devices,

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:53.770
we don't recharge ourselves.

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.490
We assume we can just work
harder without a break.

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:02.210
We learn an operating system
as children and stick with it.

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.560
Imagine if we were stuck
using Windows 94 today--

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.870
nightmare.

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:11.860
It's strange, right, how
we learn thinking patterns

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.290
at an early age from the
circumstances we're in,

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:15.790
or the people around us?

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.030
And many just accept
that for life.

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.960
Your parents could be the
smartest people in the world,

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.670
but are they really
the right ones

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.610
to mold your thinking forever?

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.440
I believe our minds and our
thinking require the same care

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.020
and attention as we
put into upgrading

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:36.970
our technological devices.

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:43.000
As your life changes, surely,
your thinking needs to also.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.130
So today, I'm going to be
speaking about Happy Not

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.120
Perfect, a company I founded
a few years ago, purely

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.520
dedicated to looking after
your mind and your thinking.

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.830
Because as I'm
sure you can agree,

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.950
it's easy to forget that our own
hardware needs to be rewired,

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.530
recharged, and rested.

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.400
So who wants to feel less
stressed, sleeping better,

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.930
and making decisions
with a calmer mindset--

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:10.726
anyone?

00:03:10.726 --> 00:03:12.004
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:03:12.004 --> 00:03:15.150
POPPY JAMIE: Great, let's
see if we can help out.

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.900
So I thought before I launch
into the tools we've developed,

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.611
I thought I'd begin by telling
you a little bit about why

00:03:21.611 --> 00:03:22.110
I'm here.

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.450
I know we heard a brief
[INAUDIBLE] earlier.

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.210
I grew up in a really
unique environment--

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:30.220
mother being a psychotherapist
and a father an entrepreneur,

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.790
he suffered from severe
stress and anxiety.

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.380
And from a young
age, I was taught

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:38.040
our emotional health was
delicate, and saw firsthand

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:43.500
how stress and anxiety not only
affects an individual, how it

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.720
spreads quickly between people.

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.650
I watched my mother dedicate her
life to learning new therapies

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.440
to pass on to my father.

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.770
We would wake up and she
would say, brush her teeth,

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:54.810
wash your face.

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.450
Now how will you look
after your mind today?

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:00.060
Meditation, breathing,
walking outside,

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.700
were as normal as
eating in our household.

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.220
And later on, I
became a TV presenter.

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:06.739
Three years ago,
I launched a show

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:08.030
called "Pillowtalk with Poppy."

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:11.340
[CLICKS TONGUE] And from
that, did I realize,

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.040
when I started to read messages
being sent to me from people

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.490
all around the world, didn't
matter their age or location

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:20.640
or gender-- so many of these
messages said the same things.

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:21.329
I'm stressed.

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:24.660
I'm worried about home, work,
family, friends, relationships,

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.100
the future.

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:27.210
And I could relate.

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:28.950
I was feeling it myself.

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:32.520
The constant feeling of needing
to try harder, be more, look

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:35.460
more, keep up.

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.320
This sparked me to
research further

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.050
and I began to look into
the macro mental health data

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:40.880
trends.

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:44.370
And what I found changed the
course of my life forever.

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:47.960
Things were even
worse than I imagined.

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.920
We are in a mental and an
emotional health epidemic.

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:54.290
Stress and anxiety is
at an all-time high.

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:56.580
According to the American
Psychological Association,

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:57.954
millennials are
the most stressed

00:04:57.954 --> 00:04:59.460
out generation
that's ever lived.

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:04.950
And sadly, this has risen
again by another 5% this year.

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:05.950
Is it social media?

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:07.300
Why is this happening?

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.090
The fact we're on comparison
overload, information overload.

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:11.950
And studies have
proven those who

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:15.430
spend more time scrolling
tend to have lower self-esteem

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:18.280
and high levels of
stress and anxiety.

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:21.640
Is it just because life has
got more stressful in general?

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:23.740
John S. Price, a psychiatrist--

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:26.170
he advises his clients
to actually stop

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:29.460
watching television news,
noting "climate change,

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.530
nuclear apocalypse, Ebola,
flesh-eating viruses,

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:35.200
antibiotic resistance,
ever-growing economic

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.210
inequality, fake news--
the list is endless.

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:39.880
It's too much for people
to hear on a daily basis."

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:42.730
And some say humans
in Western societies

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:45.040
are becoming more
psychologically sensitive

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:48.520
because there is less pressure
on us to survive now that food

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.410
and water are so abundant.

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:53.530
They believe our gaze has
moved away from survival

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:56.500
and shifted inward
and so we're suffering

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:58.480
from internal problems more.

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:00.430
So whether it's the
likes of manipulating

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:03.070
our self-worth, the
bombardment of perfect images,

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:06.550
the over-stimulation, the
fact we know what our sister's

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:09.150
boyfriend's mother's
grandmother's dog owner's

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:13.330
child is having for breakfast,
whatever the reason be is,

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:17.620
three years ago, I thought, this
can't be now what we call life.

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:19.840
That we can't except
this as our reality--

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:22.570
highly stressed, anxious, not
feeling enough and terrified

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:25.150
of real connection.

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:26.290
No, I refuse.

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:29.180
I need to create some
sort of solution.

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:32.320
So with the help and inspiration
of my mum's focus on the mind,

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:36.850
I tracked down a neuroscientist,
my CEO, a brain cognitive app

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:41.510
game developer, and we started
building Happy Not Perfect.

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:44.860
We wanted it to be a mind
gym, to help us build muscles,

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:46.810
those inner happiness muscles.

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:49.930
To help us strengthen
our emotional resilience,

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:52.710
the bounce-back skill
in the face of setback.

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:55.480
A gym to help us take back
the control of our minds

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:59.470
and get off this roller coaster,
the roller coaster of emotions

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:02.260
many of us continually sit
on, just waiting for life

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:03.130
to happen.

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:04.690
You may know the feeling--

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:06.190
you're strapped in.

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:09.640
You sit there excitedly
as your carriage moves up.

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:10.540
It's moving up.

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:13.390
Things seem to be going really
well, and at the same time,

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:16.540
you're slightly and
constantly in fear something

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:20.440
might go wrong, and the
drop is about to happen.

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:24.010
Yes, got a bonus, going on
a date, epic night out--

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:27.640
no, missed the deadline
and you're at the bottom.

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:30.340
We don't need to be on this
roller coaster of emotion.

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:32.280
We can step off.

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:35.800
But we need to have the
tools and practice to do so.

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:37.300
And the good news
is, science has

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:40.330
proved we don't need to
be on a constant roller

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:42.700
coaster of emotion.

00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:45.040
With the magic of
neuroplasticity,

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:47.320
meaning our brains are
really like plastic--

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:49.720
we can mold, we can rewire.

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:51.684
Just like if you wanted
to change your body,

00:07:51.684 --> 00:07:53.350
you would have to
commit to working out,

00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:55.730
your brain is exactly the same.

00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:57.340
It's not a click
of your fingers--

00:07:57.340 --> 00:07:58.960
suddenly, you're
running a marathon.

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:01.480
Sadly, you've got to train.

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:03.700
We can't just wake up
and expect to feel good.

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:07.720
Feeling good takes work
and it takes dedication.

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:13.270
You have to choose to
take action to feel good.

00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:15.940
So instead of finding all the
tools in different places--

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:18.580
meditation over here,
breathwork, diary there--

00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:22.120
Happy Not Perfect set
about to combine many tools

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:25.450
supported by positive
psychology and research studies

00:08:25.450 --> 00:08:30.160
into one place so you can take
your mindfulness happy gym

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:32.900
in your pocket everywhere.

00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:34.850
So I'm going to take
you through the app

00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:38.919
so you can experience your very
own full mind workout, which

00:08:38.919 --> 00:08:40.600
we call the refresh.

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:43.210
And it aims to relax,
process thoughts,

00:08:43.210 --> 00:08:47.260
and find a positive perspective
in less than five minutes.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:50.180
It's a daily ritual.

00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:54.430
So we have to reset our
default because our default,

00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:59.050
our caveman minds, they
are fundamentally negative.

00:08:59.050 --> 00:09:01.060
For evolutionary
reasons, we were trained

00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:02.770
to look for the negative first.

00:09:02.770 --> 00:09:04.797
For example, I would
walk into an environment

00:09:04.797 --> 00:09:06.130
and I would look for the threat.

00:09:06.130 --> 00:09:07.420
And I would see a
lion over there,

00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:09.461
and I would think danger,
danger, danger, danger.

00:09:09.461 --> 00:09:11.510
Let's retreat.

00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:15.430
And so as a consequence,
we have evolved

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:19.780
to reportedly have about
70% negative thoughts

00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:21.130
in our outlook.

00:09:21.130 --> 00:09:23.320
But in 2018, there
aren't any lions

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:27.640
hanging out on Spring Street,
aside from a toxic boss.

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:30.430
So we don't need to
have this negative bias.

00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:34.010
The refresh workout is designed
to upgrade your hardware.

00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:37.240
The useful thing about
this is that you can

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:39.980
do at home, at work, on the go.

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:42.010
You don't have to
close your eyes.

00:09:42.010 --> 00:09:45.940
So let's jump into it.

00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:47.740
Here is your home screen.

00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:50.590
And you can either, obviously,
choose to take a refresh,

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:52.910
or you can listen to
our daily dose, which

00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:57.340
is a thought for the
day, some positive wisdom

00:09:57.340 --> 00:09:58.499
to change your outlook.

00:09:58.499 --> 00:09:59.290
I love this quote--

00:09:59.290 --> 00:10:01.660
Marianne Williamson
says, "a miracle is just

00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:03.380
a shift in perspective."

00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:04.900
And the daily dose
hopes to give you

00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:06.610
a shift in perspective
every single day.

00:10:06.610 --> 00:10:10.090
But let's jump into the refresh.

00:10:10.090 --> 00:10:12.750
Step one-- how do you feel?

00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:18.130
Now studies found that just
by acknowledging how you feel,

00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:21.670
you actually start slowing
down the emotional center

00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:23.840
of your brain, the amygdala.

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:26.540
And we have over 25 emotions
you can choose from.

00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:30.140
And it's amazing how much we
go through life on autopilot.

00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:32.089
We never check in with
actually how we feel.

00:10:32.089 --> 00:10:34.380
You walk into the office and
someone says, how are you?

00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:35.713
And you're like, yeah, I'm good.

00:10:35.713 --> 00:10:36.860
But you're not.

00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:40.600
You're actually still really
fucked up from yesterday.

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:44.140
And anyways, so for the
purposes of this talk,

00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:47.230
I'm selecting that I'm
feeling stressed, as I'm very

00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:49.650
stressed about public speaking.

00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:52.990
And step two-- and that's--
it's crazy, so simple.

00:10:52.990 --> 00:10:55.300
Just choose your
emotion and you start

00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:57.310
activating your brain
in a way that you

00:10:57.310 --> 00:10:59.180
can feel more balanced--

00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:00.340
so simple.

00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:01.420
Step two-- breathe.

00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:04.060
Now I want to do a little
experiment before we launch

00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:06.640
into the breathing
step and to see

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:09.640
how well you guys breathe, OK?

00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:15.846
So can you all give me a big
inhale how and a big exhale.

00:11:15.846 --> 00:11:19.640
So who felt themselves
go up on the inhale

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:23.070
and down on the exhale?

00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:25.380
Fantastic-- I'm so glad you're
here, because you're all

00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:26.890
terrible breathers.

00:11:26.890 --> 00:11:31.050
And don't worry-- nine out of
10 people are bad breathers,

00:11:31.050 --> 00:11:33.870
and this is what I
found so insane to me.

00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:35.940
I went to go train with
a breathing instructor

00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:40.240
under one of the world's
leading specialists, Dr. Belisa

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:41.370
Vranich.

00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:45.600
And she educated me on
how badly our breathing

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:46.966
habits have become.

00:11:46.966 --> 00:11:48.840
And usually, we get into
bad breathing habits

00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:51.173
from the age of five years
old, because we go to school,

00:11:51.173 --> 00:11:52.140
we hunch over desks.

00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:54.970
And as a consequence, all
our breath goes up here.

00:11:54.970 --> 00:11:56.940
So when people start
breathing like this,

00:11:56.940 --> 00:11:58.320
you're moving neck
and shoulders,

00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:01.650
but your neck and shoulders
are not breathing muscles.

00:12:01.650 --> 00:12:03.870
Your breathing muscles are here.

00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:06.900
So it makes no sense that
we spend all day, every day,

00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:07.860
going like this.

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:10.860
And all that's doing is hiking
up our cortisol, the stress

00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:13.650
hormone, impacting
our immune system

00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:15.480
and making us feel
more stressed.

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:18.130
So immediately, when we
start consciously breathing

00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:21.176
and we belly breathe,
we're able to stimulate

00:12:21.176 --> 00:12:23.550
our vagus nerve that takes us
out of the fight and flight

00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:26.400
system into the rest
and relax system.

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:29.580
So I want us all to give--
do a belly breath together.

00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:31.690
So hands on your belly.

00:12:31.690 --> 00:12:35.000
And I want you, on the inhale,
to expand as if a balloon is

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.240
inside your lungs.

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:42.630
So inhale, expand, and exhale.

00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:45.550
Squeeze all the air out.

00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:48.320
Belly to spine-- inhale.

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:50.860
Expand your belly.

00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:53.070
Exhale.

00:12:53.070 --> 00:12:55.580
Belly to spine--
squeeze all the air out.

00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:56.590
Now let's do that again.

00:12:56.590 --> 00:12:58.560
Inhale.

00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:02.240
Now try and sip
some more air in.

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:06.729
And exhale, relax
your shoulders.

00:13:06.729 --> 00:13:08.270
You notice a slight
difference in how

00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:10.760
you're breathing just then?

00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:13.860
Yes, nod-- great.

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:17.070
So in the app, it not only
tells you how to breathe.

00:13:17.070 --> 00:13:20.280
And also through biofeedback,
just relaxing your shoulders,

00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:24.150
you're using your body to send
messages to your brain to say,

00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:25.460
I'm not in danger.

00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:27.000
A lion is not attacking me.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.320
I'm safe.

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:30.300
And then you're able to
breathe for either 30

00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:31.480
seconds, a minute.

00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:36.270
And again, we wanted to make
sure this was super visually

00:13:36.270 --> 00:13:39.450
stimulating, rather than
what I kind of found

00:13:39.450 --> 00:13:43.211
when I was looking around the
market for kind of breathing

00:13:43.211 --> 00:13:43.710
tools.

00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:45.870
I found them all pretty boring.

00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:47.490
Step three-- journaling.

00:13:47.490 --> 00:13:50.250
This, again, may seem so
simple, this exercise.

00:13:50.250 --> 00:13:52.747
But if I told you all that
I invented the sit-up,

00:13:52.747 --> 00:13:53.580
you'd be like, what?

00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:55.470
That's so basic.

00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:57.490
It's just a body
moving up and down.

00:13:57.490 --> 00:13:59.940
And this is what's so
incredible about mindfulness

00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:02.280
is that the most
simplest of activities

00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:05.260
have such an amazing
positive impact on your mind.

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:10.830
So when you journal and actually
allow yourself to write down

00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:13.590
how you're feeling, you
start activating the computer

00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:15.430
side of your brain,
your prefrontal cortex,

00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:18.090
and that helps calm the
emotional center even more,

00:14:18.090 --> 00:14:22.770
furthering your movement into
the rest and relax state.

00:14:22.770 --> 00:14:25.590
They say a problem shared
is a problem halved,

00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:26.890
and it is really true.

00:14:26.890 --> 00:14:28.890
You're able to create
that rational distance

00:14:28.890 --> 00:14:32.070
between what's been happening
in your life and processing it.

00:14:32.070 --> 00:14:34.230
So in the app, it allows
you-- it gives you

00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:36.310
a different question
depending on the emotion you

00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:37.710
select at the beginning.

00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:40.676
The experience is
tailored to your mood.

00:14:40.676 --> 00:14:42.300
So I wrote I'm about
to speak at Google

00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:44.258
and I really hope I don't
fuck this up-- great.

00:14:44.258 --> 00:14:47.207
And then, the whole
screen explodes

00:14:47.207 --> 00:14:49.290
because I was so fascinated
by burning ceremonies.

00:14:49.290 --> 00:14:51.420
But I thought to myself,
well, health and safety.

00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:53.790
I don't want anybody to
be burning down houses.

00:14:53.790 --> 00:14:55.290
I just thought I'd
put it in an app.

00:14:55.290 --> 00:14:58.330
So we worked really
hard to make sure

00:14:58.330 --> 00:15:01.080
that you could have your
own mini-burning ritual

00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:04.860
and then visually can see
yourself letting go of worries.

00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:06.960
What I find incredible
about human beings

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:10.410
is that we really like
to handicap ourselves.

00:15:10.410 --> 00:15:13.110
We experience all these
emotions on a day-to-day basis,

00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:16.350
and yet we never kind of
process them and let them go.

00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:18.570
It's like we have an emotional
backpack that we keep

00:15:18.570 --> 00:15:20.220
filling up every single day.

00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:23.100
And after a while, that
backpack gets very heavy.

00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:25.140
So why not allow
yourself to release

00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:28.680
every single day a little bit
and make the load lighter,

00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:30.180
make life easier for yourself?

00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:32.480
Step four-- what are
you grateful for?

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:34.390
Now look, I know you
can go on Instagram

00:15:34.390 --> 00:15:37.470
and see a lot of
smug #blessed posts,

00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:39.620
but this is not about that.

00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:42.840
Your grateful diary
is incredible.

00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:45.990
It not only helps
stimulate positive hormones

00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:47.869
and helps you sleep better.

00:15:47.869 --> 00:15:49.410
Studies found that
people go to sleep

00:15:49.410 --> 00:15:52.710
with a more positive mental
attitude tend to have a better

00:15:52.710 --> 00:15:53.830
quality of sleep.

00:15:53.830 --> 00:15:55.362
So doing this
before bed is great.

00:15:55.362 --> 00:15:57.570
But what I really think is
amazing behind the science

00:15:57.570 --> 00:16:01.427
behind gratitude is the ability
to set your brain filters.

00:16:01.427 --> 00:16:03.510
Now I'm not sure if this
has ever happened to you,

00:16:03.510 --> 00:16:06.450
but let's say you
purchase a red car.

00:16:06.450 --> 00:16:10.140
And you're driving in your
red car and you suddenly go,

00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:12.900
everybody has bought a red car.

00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:14.560
I am a trendsetter.

00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:17.010
And sadly, you're
not a trendsetter.

00:16:17.010 --> 00:16:19.620
No more red cars
are on the road.

00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:22.110
Just red cars are
more relevant to you.

00:16:22.110 --> 00:16:24.150
We have so much information
being fired at us

00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:25.920
on a day-to-day
basis, our brain is

00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:28.170
so clever, it kind of
does the Google search

00:16:28.170 --> 00:16:30.260
for us-- like, what is
relevant, what is not,

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:32.510
what should I take notes
of, what should I not?

00:16:32.510 --> 00:16:34.590
So by writing a
grateful diary, you

00:16:34.590 --> 00:16:37.110
set your own filters
to say, actually,

00:16:37.110 --> 00:16:40.050
looking for things that
are good in my life

00:16:40.050 --> 00:16:43.240
is now going to become
relevant information.

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:45.670
Set your own Google filters--

00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:47.830
write a grateful diary
every single day.

00:16:47.830 --> 00:16:49.460
It is incredible.

00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:51.060
Step five-- game time.

00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:55.410
Now games are fantastic at
interrupting negative thought

00:16:55.410 --> 00:16:56.070
loops.

00:16:56.070 --> 00:16:59.990
It is a different type of
mindfulness experience.

00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:01.890
You're focusing on
one thing rather than

00:17:01.890 --> 00:17:03.750
our kind of ADHD
generation, when

00:17:03.750 --> 00:17:06.609
you're thinking about lots of
things, which can be stressful.

00:17:06.609 --> 00:17:09.300
So we allow you to play a
different game every day.

00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:13.170
We have a kind of a
coloring-it-in activity.

00:17:13.170 --> 00:17:16.950
And I was fascinated by the
research around art therapy.

00:17:16.950 --> 00:17:19.200
Step six-- self-compassion.

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:22.079
Now I just want to ask
you a question-- how many

00:17:22.079 --> 00:17:24.839
of you in the first half
an hour of waking up

00:17:24.839 --> 00:17:30.130
go on your social media
to scroll through feeds?

00:17:30.130 --> 00:17:35.440
Yeah, OK, so, yeah, a good
amount-- yeah, 80% of you.

00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:38.580
And let's just have a think
about that ritual, OK?

00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:41.620
So we wake up every single
day and we go to our phone.

00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:44.200
So before we've even checked
in with our self, even thought

00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:45.910
about ourselves,
we're immediately

00:17:45.910 --> 00:17:47.410
thinking about other people.

00:17:47.410 --> 00:17:49.900
After years of
doing this day in,

00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:53.050
day out, all we do is
like everybody else,

00:17:53.050 --> 00:17:53.920
like everybody else.

00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:57.460
Of course, that is going to have
an effect on our self-esteem.

00:17:57.460 --> 00:18:01.010
Not for one moment do we think
to ourselves, what do we have?

00:18:01.010 --> 00:18:02.210
Like, what's good?

00:18:02.210 --> 00:18:04.210
We just go, oh, yeah,
she's got a great holiday.

00:18:04.210 --> 00:18:06.675
Awesome, she looks
great, awesome.

00:18:06.675 --> 00:18:08.140
I'm double-tapping
everybody else.

00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:10.210
So I'm like, no--

00:18:10.210 --> 00:18:11.590
self-compassion.

00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:13.220
Double-tap yourself.

00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:16.450
And so this step is all
about double-tapping yourself

00:18:16.450 --> 00:18:19.120
and building up your resilience.

00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:21.730
And step seven-- make
someone else feel good.

00:18:21.730 --> 00:18:24.100
It's amazing in our
narcissistic world

00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:25.770
how little we
think about others.

00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:29.020
And every-- so many
studies will show

00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:33.040
that people that think about
others the most are happier.

00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:36.760
Now you will see on
your seats, you actually

00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:39.730
have a physical vibe card.

00:18:39.730 --> 00:18:43.960
And I hope that you will
give that to somebody today.

00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:45.250
Pay it forward.

00:18:45.250 --> 00:18:48.700
And we have the same philosophy
on the app-- every single day,

00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:52.510
the app asks you, who can
you send a positive note to?

00:18:52.510 --> 00:18:57.010
It's incredible how much
you can change someone's day

00:18:57.010 --> 00:19:01.192
by just letting them know
you're thinking about them.

00:19:01.192 --> 00:19:05.270
And so this allows you to
send positive messages.

00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:06.140
And you did it.

00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:08.870
In under five minutes, you
did a full mind workout,

00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:11.690
stimulating your
prefrontal cortex,

00:19:11.690 --> 00:19:16.070
relaxing and calming your
amygdala, the emotional center,

00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:19.280
helped you stimulate serotonin.

00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:21.150
And you didn't have
to close your eyes.

00:19:21.150 --> 00:19:22.650
There is no reason
why you shouldn't

00:19:22.650 --> 00:19:23.970
be doing this every single day.

00:19:23.970 --> 00:19:28.070
Now aside from the refresh,
we have a meditation library.

00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:29.990
And I was fascinated
about meditation

00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:33.050
because I felt that it was
something we all want to do,

00:19:33.050 --> 00:19:34.647
but we all kind of forget.

00:19:34.647 --> 00:19:36.980
Because as soon as you wake
up and you've got the alarm,

00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:37.870
and suddenly you're
like, oh, god,

00:19:37.870 --> 00:19:39.260
I need to see that
person later and I've

00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:41.080
to respond to this email
and I've to do this.

00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:41.913
I've got to do this.

00:19:41.913 --> 00:19:43.700
Suddenly, our entire
morning is gone.

00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:46.094
Those that have a
meditation practice--

00:19:46.094 --> 00:19:46.760
it's incredible.

00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:50.180
There's again, so much
research behind meditation

00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:52.670
helping us to calm the
emotional center more.

00:19:52.670 --> 00:19:57.650
It even lengthens your
telomeres, which in your brain,

00:19:57.650 --> 00:19:59.130
can help prevent--

00:19:59.130 --> 00:20:02.690
it can help prevent the
slowdown of cell rejuvenation.

00:20:02.690 --> 00:20:04.349
So it can help in anti-aging.

00:20:04.349 --> 00:20:05.390
I mean, isn't that crazy?

00:20:05.390 --> 00:20:07.181
You don't need an
anti-aging cream anymore.

00:20:07.181 --> 00:20:09.760
You just need to meditate.

00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:11.430
But I wanted to
make meditation fun.

00:20:11.430 --> 00:20:12.830
So we did a ton of focus groups.

00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:13.880
And I said, well,
what do you really

00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:14.990
want to hear meditations about?

00:20:14.990 --> 00:20:16.448
And they were like,
well, actually,

00:20:16.448 --> 00:20:19.220
[SIGHS] how to bounce
back from rejection,

00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:23.900
or removing exes--
good riddance.

00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:25.970
And I was like,
yeah, done, cool--

00:20:25.970 --> 00:20:27.350
the fuck-it meditation.

00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:29.250
Yeah, we're going
to put it in there.

00:20:29.250 --> 00:20:31.160
So we really wanted to
bring some personality

00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:34.440
to mental wellness because
it can become very boring.

00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:37.372
So we have lots there for you--

00:20:37.372 --> 00:20:39.830
Three Days to Bounce Back From
Rejection-- one of my faves.

00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:41.750
Jody Shield-- fantastic guide.

00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:47.600
But the thing is with
all of these kind

00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:50.540
of mindfulness rituals
is that they only

00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:53.360
really work with repetition.

00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:56.390
Just like if you wanted
to train for a marathon,

00:20:56.390 --> 00:20:58.850
you would have to
train every single day.

00:20:58.850 --> 00:21:01.130
Just like keeping
your teeth healthy,

00:21:01.130 --> 00:21:02.770
we all know at the
age of five, we

00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:05.270
need to brush our
teeth every single day.

00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:07.190
And just like
learning the piano--

00:21:07.190 --> 00:21:09.180
requires practice.

00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:12.290
So if you want to develop
a positive mental outlet,

00:21:12.290 --> 00:21:14.930
optimistic thinking,
it requires practice.

00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:20.610
Caring for yourself
is really not selfish.

00:21:20.610 --> 00:21:23.750
You are massively
doing us all a favor.

00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:26.240
And so, we have
a mission to make

00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:30.290
sure looking after our mind
is as normal, easy, and fun

00:21:30.290 --> 00:21:31.820
as brushing the teeth.

00:21:31.820 --> 00:21:34.580
Emotional education, awareness
around mental well-being,

00:21:34.580 --> 00:21:35.990
can change the world.

00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:38.360
But it really starts
at an individual level.

00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:42.470
It requires us all to look after
and upgrade our own hardware,

00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:45.680
to stop behavior and negative
thought patterns being passed

00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:48.830
through generations
as learnt behaviors.

00:21:48.830 --> 00:21:50.540
But for us all to
wake up and realize

00:21:50.540 --> 00:21:54.110
we have the power
over what we think.

00:21:54.110 --> 00:21:56.940
And OK, we have
moments of struggling,

00:21:56.940 --> 00:21:59.790
but we can all do
something about it.

00:21:59.790 --> 00:22:01.300
So thank you for listening.

00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:02.584
I hope you enjoy the app.

00:22:02.584 --> 00:22:04.250
Please share it with
friends and family.

00:22:04.250 --> 00:22:06.950
If there's anyone here
who'd like to collaborate,

00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:09.380
help spread the word
through Google Play,

00:22:09.380 --> 00:22:10.730
I'd be really grateful.

00:22:10.730 --> 00:22:12.222
Thank you for listening.

00:22:12.222 --> 00:22:13.650
[APPLAUSE]

00:22:16.506 --> 00:22:18.300
MILA BERNABO: Thank you so much.

00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:21.480
That was very cool, to see
all the different steps.

00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:23.355
My favorite part, and
I encourage all of you,

00:22:23.355 --> 00:22:25.396
because you couldn't see
it while on the screen--

00:22:25.396 --> 00:22:26.010
do the burn--

00:22:26.010 --> 00:22:29.340
that is my favorite
thing on the app.

00:22:29.340 --> 00:22:31.740
I'm curious, Poppy,
what surprised you most

00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:37.550
from the research when you first
started developing the app?

00:22:37.550 --> 00:22:40.020
POPPY JAMIE: How, to
be honest, little we

00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:42.930
know about our own mind.

00:22:42.930 --> 00:22:46.770
I started doing research just
asking people, what's anxiety?

00:22:46.770 --> 00:22:49.620
And nobody would even be able
to tell me what anxiety was.

00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:51.180
And I thought that's so crazy.

00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:52.020
You go to school.

00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:53.070
You learn how to brush--

00:22:53.070 --> 00:22:55.349
you learn how to read and write.

00:22:55.349 --> 00:22:57.390
But yet no one tells you
how to be a human being.

00:22:57.390 --> 00:23:02.385
No one tells you how to
deal with and process loss.

00:23:02.385 --> 00:23:03.510
That's all going to happen.

00:23:03.510 --> 00:23:04.950
It's going to
happen to all of us,

00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:08.260
or a break-up, social
rejection, disappointment.

00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:11.160
And that's what I've
found so phenomenal,

00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:15.640
is how little we knew about the
thing that controls our mind.

00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:17.580
MILA BERNABO:
Right, right, right.

00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:19.920
And was there anything
in your research,

00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:22.830
and then in developing the app,
parts that, different exercises

00:23:22.830 --> 00:23:25.140
that you cut out, or you
wish you could have included?

00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:26.699
Or was this sort of
the final product

00:23:26.699 --> 00:23:27.990
that you were super happy with?

00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:29.364
I'm curious is
there was anything

00:23:29.364 --> 00:23:31.415
else you were considering.

00:23:31.415 --> 00:23:35.970
POPPY JAMIE: So I
feel like my CEO would

00:23:35.970 --> 00:23:38.510
be laughing right
now because I think

00:23:38.510 --> 00:23:40.980
we are always on a constant--

00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:45.030
that's the beauty of app
developing, is that I'm like,

00:23:45.030 --> 00:23:46.470
can we go to Mars already?

00:23:46.470 --> 00:23:48.780
And he's, like, no, Poppy,
we're building the rocket.

00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:54.850
And so we had to put in
the fundamental features

00:23:54.850 --> 00:23:58.950
I really felt were absolutely
necessary in everybody

00:23:58.950 --> 00:24:01.800
needing to look after
their mind at stage one.

00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:04.770
And then we have a
whole kind of blueprint

00:24:04.770 --> 00:24:07.300
about where we're going to go.

00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:10.290
But really, when
we were thinking

00:24:10.290 --> 00:24:13.860
about this whole philosophy
about a mind gym,

00:24:13.860 --> 00:24:15.390
like a normal gym,
if we were going

00:24:15.390 --> 00:24:16.500
to set up a gym right
now, we would be like,

00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:18.041
OK, maybe we need
a running machine--

00:24:18.041 --> 00:24:18.750
OK, sure.

00:24:18.750 --> 00:24:19.980
Maybe we need some
weights-- great.

00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:20.830
So that's what we can did.

00:24:20.830 --> 00:24:22.450
We're like, what
are the necessaries,

00:24:22.450 --> 00:24:25.717
and then we'll have our kind
of luxury items coming soon.

00:24:25.717 --> 00:24:26.550
MILA BERNABO: Great.

00:24:26.550 --> 00:24:29.280
Is there anything you can share
with us of what's coming next

00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:30.300
for Happy Not Perfect?

00:24:32.542 --> 00:24:33.750
Or should we just stay tuned?

00:24:33.750 --> 00:24:34.249
[LAUGHS]

00:24:34.249 --> 00:24:36.225
POPPY JAMIE: Stay
tuned, stay tuned.

00:24:36.225 --> 00:24:37.065
[LAUGHS]

00:24:37.065 --> 00:24:39.570
MILA BERNABO: Perfect, perfect.

00:24:39.570 --> 00:24:41.250
I'd love to also hear
a little bit more

00:24:41.250 --> 00:24:42.750
about the inspiration
for the app.

00:24:42.750 --> 00:24:45.120
You talked about your mom,
which I love that story.

00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:47.610
Can you tell us a bit more
about your personal experience

00:24:47.610 --> 00:24:49.320
with stress, with anxiety?

00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:52.740
You juggle two
companies and brands,

00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:54.840
and what is this like
in your day-to-day life?

00:24:58.085 --> 00:24:59.810
POPPY JAMIE: It's
interesting, actually--

00:24:59.810 --> 00:25:02.210
Happy Not Perfect is--

00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:04.320
I don't know how I'd
live without it now.

00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:07.700
Because I used to
love buying journals,

00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:10.870
and the five-minute journal,
I loved, for example--

00:25:10.870 --> 00:25:12.260
it asked different questions.

00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:14.420
But I found that
I would lose them

00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:17.530
and that I would be absolutely
mortified if someone read it.

00:25:17.530 --> 00:25:19.550
And it was so impractical.

00:25:19.550 --> 00:25:22.139
And also, I loved
a self-help book,

00:25:22.139 --> 00:25:23.930
but then I thought,
oh, my god, if somebody

00:25:23.930 --> 00:25:26.138
looks on my bookcase, they're
like, who is this girl?

00:25:26.138 --> 00:25:27.590
She's got some serious issues.

00:25:27.590 --> 00:25:31.390
[LAUGHS] So it's really--

00:25:31.390 --> 00:25:33.500
to have something,
a tool that I'm

00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:36.620
able to use every
single day to balance

00:25:36.620 --> 00:25:41.177
all the different things
I'm doing has just been--

00:25:41.177 --> 00:25:42.260
it's just been phenomenal.

00:25:42.260 --> 00:25:45.180
And something I really,
really do kind of--

00:25:45.180 --> 00:25:47.960
you know, I said,
I use it myself.

00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:50.150
And I just think it's
interesting we live in

00:25:50.150 --> 00:25:51.830
a such a different world.

00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:55.370
I say we had the Industrial
Revolution, humanity totally

00:25:55.370 --> 00:25:56.900
changed the way we lived life.

00:25:56.900 --> 00:25:59.060
And then we had this
technological revolution.

00:25:59.060 --> 00:26:01.910
And again, we are living
in a very different world

00:26:01.910 --> 00:26:04.250
to where we were 20 years ago.

00:26:04.250 --> 00:26:07.520
So I feel passionately
about us all

00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:10.580
adapting to this new, very
fast-paced world in order

00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:13.805
for us to survive in a happy
way, rather than struggling.

00:26:13.805 --> 00:26:15.327
MILA BERNABO:
Sure, sure, and are

00:26:15.327 --> 00:26:16.910
there any other daily
rituals that you

00:26:16.910 --> 00:26:18.965
do in self-care to manage?

00:26:18.965 --> 00:26:22.580
POPPY JAMIE: Yeah, I'm a major
fan of walking meditations.

00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:26.660
I will usually, before I even
brush my teeth, I'll be-- just

00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:29.320
do a 15-minute
walk when I wake up

00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:31.580
because it just
kind of brings me

00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:34.610
slowly, nice into the
world away from my sleep.

00:26:34.610 --> 00:26:37.100
And it just helps
calm everything.

00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:38.630
So I'm a major fan of walking.

00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:41.250
If I can walk-- like
rain, snow, shine,

00:26:41.250 --> 00:26:43.280
I'm there, out there
with some trainers.

00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:45.530
I feel like that's
massively helpful.

00:26:45.530 --> 00:26:49.190
And also, because obviously,
so many of us have office jobs,

00:26:49.190 --> 00:26:51.337
it's incredible how
little daylight we get.

00:26:51.337 --> 00:26:52.920
And actually, daylight
is so important

00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:55.940
to be stimulating our
vitamin D. So just getting

00:26:55.940 --> 00:26:57.890
outside, regardless
of the weather,

00:26:57.890 --> 00:27:00.280
is so critical to
feeling better.

00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:01.810
MILA BERNABO: Mm, I love that.

00:27:01.810 --> 00:27:03.710
We need to get out
of here more often.

00:27:03.710 --> 00:27:04.520
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:07.690
We have beautiful terraces, but
there's a world outside Google

00:27:07.690 --> 00:27:09.470
to explore.

00:27:09.470 --> 00:27:13.496
A couple years ago, you did
a TEDx talk on our addiction

00:27:13.496 --> 00:27:14.870
to likes, which
you talked about,

00:27:14.870 --> 00:27:16.850
sort of social media and
the effect of technology

00:27:16.850 --> 00:27:17.600
on our well-being.

00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:21.680
And here, being at Google,
I'm curious, how do you

00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:24.420
manage your own sort of
relationship with social media,

00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:25.100
with technology?

00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:28.200
Do you have any advice for
all of us on what to do?

00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:30.020
POPPY JAMIE: I think it's--

00:27:30.020 --> 00:27:32.910
again, it's so interesting,
because we didn't really

00:27:32.910 --> 00:27:35.210
need to think about this
until, I would say, maybe

00:27:35.210 --> 00:27:37.130
in the last year and a half.

00:27:37.130 --> 00:27:38.510
Because we were all--

00:27:38.510 --> 00:27:39.500
it was interesting.

00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:41.610
We were just-- it
was like a new toy,

00:27:41.610 --> 00:27:45.080
and we didn't know what
it was really doing to us.

00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:48.560
And now, I did the
TED talk on addicted

00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:53.120
to likes, a couple of years ago
I really started to notice how

00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:54.950
obviously those
little [CLICKS TONGUE]

00:27:54.950 --> 00:27:58.070
double taps triggering the
dopamine release in your brain.

00:27:58.070 --> 00:27:58.940
You wanting more.

00:27:58.940 --> 00:28:01.610
And how kind of bad you can feel
if you don't get as many as you

00:28:01.610 --> 00:28:03.300
want to get, and whatever.

00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:05.180
So as a consequence,
I really try

00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:09.380
to do social media-free
weekends just

00:28:09.380 --> 00:28:12.950
because it helps me be
more present with everybody

00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:14.000
I'm around.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:15.880
Because I think it's--

00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:17.950
everybody noticed the
person at the table.

00:28:17.950 --> 00:28:22.370
That attention goes as soon
as they get out their device.

00:28:22.370 --> 00:28:24.830
And then kind of the
conversation and the attention

00:28:24.830 --> 00:28:26.090
shifts.

00:28:26.090 --> 00:28:28.975
So I try and do social
media-free weekends.

00:28:28.975 --> 00:28:30.850
And that's the thing--
technology is amazing.

00:28:30.850 --> 00:28:33.590
I think sometimes it can
get a really bad rep.

00:28:33.590 --> 00:28:38.480
But it's how we use it a lot
is causing us the problems.

00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:40.710
So if we can balance everything.

00:28:40.710 --> 00:28:43.010
If we ate too much,
we'd feel unhealthy.

00:28:43.010 --> 00:28:46.040
Or it's like anything in
life-- everything in moderation

00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:47.430
is brilliant, right?

00:28:47.430 --> 00:28:49.730
MILA BERNABO: Sure,
sure, wonderful.

00:28:49.730 --> 00:28:51.644
And sort of turning
to you a little bit,

00:28:51.644 --> 00:28:53.810
I'd love to hear about your
personal sort of journey

00:28:53.810 --> 00:28:56.750
from television
hosting personality

00:28:56.750 --> 00:28:59.640
through to your
accessory line, and now,

00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:01.686
the mindfulness
mental health app.

00:29:01.686 --> 00:29:02.810
Sort of what was that like?

00:29:02.810 --> 00:29:05.164
What led you from
one step to another?

00:29:05.164 --> 00:29:06.580
POPPY JAMIE: So,
it's interesting,

00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:10.100
because I feel like my entire
life was building up to really

00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:12.920
creating Happy Not Perfect.

00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:17.107
And everything I was
doing at the TV hosting

00:29:17.107 --> 00:29:18.690
was like the
six-year-old dream I had.

00:29:18.690 --> 00:29:21.180
I was like, I can't wait
to host television shows.

00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:23.840
And it was really
fun and exciting,

00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:25.940
but there was this
point where it just felt

00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:29.530
desperately under-fulfilling.

00:29:29.530 --> 00:29:30.800
How am I helping the world?

00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:34.390
And I just felt like if
I died being a TV host,

00:29:34.390 --> 00:29:37.400
I would be just,
like, oh, great.

00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:38.560
And also, I was really bad.

00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:40.469
Honestly, I failed
at every interview.

00:29:40.469 --> 00:29:43.010
So I don't think I would have
had a very long career, anyway,

00:29:43.010 --> 00:29:44.468
so I think I kind
of had to change.

00:29:47.210 --> 00:29:52.410
And also, being-- what
is so lovely about this,

00:29:52.410 --> 00:29:57.705
and I think I'm so grateful to
be working with an amazing team

00:29:57.705 --> 00:29:59.830
that we can create something
like Happy Not Perfect

00:29:59.830 --> 00:30:03.550
and get it to life, is
the messages we receive.

00:30:03.550 --> 00:30:05.610
In that we just had a beta--

00:30:05.610 --> 00:30:08.910
sorry, on iOS, sorry.

00:30:08.910 --> 00:30:10.770
But we get e-mails
every single day

00:30:10.770 --> 00:30:14.460
from people saying, thank you.

00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:15.750
I've never slept so well.

00:30:15.750 --> 00:30:17.660
I have finally got
over my breakup.

00:30:17.660 --> 00:30:20.130
I've finally got
a peace of mind.

00:30:20.130 --> 00:30:23.930
This is getting me
through hospital.

00:30:23.930 --> 00:30:26.520
And that feels so rewarding.

00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:28.710
So and look, start-ups
are a nightmare.

00:30:28.710 --> 00:30:32.160
Even with the fashion
line, it is brutal.

00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:34.770
You're working-- and I'm
sure everyone in this room

00:30:34.770 --> 00:30:36.780
understands how
difficult it is to--

00:30:36.780 --> 00:30:39.700
you're working on really,
obviously, exciting--

00:30:39.700 --> 00:30:41.750
and we're so lucky to
have the jobs we have.

00:30:41.750 --> 00:30:44.520
But they take their
pound of flesh.

00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:49.470
And that's interesting, talking
about mental well-being--

00:30:49.470 --> 00:30:52.200
you're seven days
a week, but when

00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:54.210
it's kind of fueled
by a passion that you

00:30:54.210 --> 00:30:55.987
know that you can
help other people,

00:30:55.987 --> 00:30:57.570
I think it just makes
it a lot easier.

00:30:57.570 --> 00:31:01.720
MILA BERNABO: Mm, I love that.

00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:04.240
I was also reading
about in 2017,

00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:07.750
that you are named one of
"Forbes" 30 under 30s--

00:31:07.750 --> 00:31:08.917
congratulations.

00:31:08.917 --> 00:31:10.750
And you were appointed
as the youngest board

00:31:10.750 --> 00:31:13.570
member of the Resnick
Psychiatric Hospital Advisory

00:31:13.570 --> 00:31:14.230
Board.

00:31:14.230 --> 00:31:16.270
I'd love to just hear-- at UCLA.

00:31:16.270 --> 00:31:18.580
I'd love to hear more about
what that experience was

00:31:18.580 --> 00:31:20.890
like, what your work
is like with them,

00:31:20.890 --> 00:31:22.960
and what you're learning
from that experience.

00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:27.110
POPPY JAMIE: UCLA is such
an incredible institution.

00:31:27.110 --> 00:31:30.970
And it's been fascinating
and a real honor

00:31:30.970 --> 00:31:34.540
to kind of see behind the scenes
and how the hospital supports

00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:35.990
the university.

00:31:35.990 --> 00:31:38.830
And they have the
Depression Grand Challenge.

00:31:38.830 --> 00:31:41.200
They have the Healthy
Campus Initiative.

00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:44.050
And they are proactively,
as a university,

00:31:44.050 --> 00:31:45.880
doing everything
they can to support

00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:47.710
student mental well-being.

00:31:47.710 --> 00:31:50.830
Mental well-being amongst
the student population

00:31:50.830 --> 00:31:53.630
is really at an all-time low.

00:31:53.630 --> 00:31:56.560
And I'm not surprised
because I think

00:31:56.560 --> 00:32:02.170
this pressure to be successful
is so enormous, especially at--

00:32:02.170 --> 00:32:05.020
these universities are
really difficult to get into.

00:32:05.020 --> 00:32:06.760
There is this feeling
of keeping up.

00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:09.340
Everything has to be perfect.

00:32:09.340 --> 00:32:13.390
And the stress these students
are putting on themselves

00:32:13.390 --> 00:32:15.350
is unmanageable.

00:32:15.350 --> 00:32:23.530
So for me, it's really lovely to
try and support in all the ways

00:32:23.530 --> 00:32:24.050
I can.

00:32:24.050 --> 00:32:27.400
Also being 28 myself,
it wasn't so long

00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:29.440
ago that I was a student.

00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:31.460
And I was actually a TV
presenting at the time,

00:32:31.460 --> 00:32:35.560
so I was balancing these two
jobs of university and work,

00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:38.470
and trying to do that.

00:32:38.470 --> 00:32:42.240
And the "Forbes" thing, I was--
that's just a real honor--

00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:45.715
yeah, real honor, like, lucky.

00:32:45.715 --> 00:32:47.380
MILA BERNABO: Amazing.

00:32:47.380 --> 00:32:49.130
Before I'm going to
ask one more question,

00:32:49.130 --> 00:32:50.504
then I invite the
audience if you

00:32:50.504 --> 00:32:52.640
want to line up at mics
if you have any questions.

00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:54.380
We'd love to hear from you.

00:32:54.380 --> 00:32:56.835
So if you could take over
the Google sort home page,

00:32:56.835 --> 00:32:58.210
the landing page,
and either do--

00:32:58.210 --> 00:32:59.192
POPPY JAMIE: Cool!

00:32:59.192 --> 00:32:59.692
Can I?

00:32:59.692 --> 00:33:00.192
[LAUGHS]

00:33:00.192 --> 00:33:02.520
MILA BERNABO: [LAUGHS]
We'll look into it.

00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:04.240
And if you could
either design a doodle

00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:07.759
or have some sort of phrase
on there, what would it be?

00:33:07.759 --> 00:33:09.550
What would your message
to be to the world?

00:33:09.550 --> 00:33:13.090
POPPY JAMIE: Tell someone
you love them today.

00:33:13.090 --> 00:33:15.100
Because I just think
we go through life--

00:33:15.100 --> 00:33:16.870
and it sounds so cringe.

00:33:16.870 --> 00:33:18.550
But it's so true--

00:33:18.550 --> 00:33:21.970
we go through life thinking
about ourselves a lot.

00:33:21.970 --> 00:33:24.310
When you're feeling
stressed or anxious,

00:33:24.310 --> 00:33:26.120
you're thinking about yourself.

00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:27.850
So I think that
actually, when we

00:33:27.850 --> 00:33:31.030
turn the attention
outward to whose day can I

00:33:31.030 --> 00:33:32.110
make better today?

00:33:32.110 --> 00:33:34.090
Who can I help today?

00:33:34.090 --> 00:33:37.420
Life is easier because you are
able to support other people.

00:33:37.420 --> 00:33:40.120
And to be honest, what is
life-- why is life worth living?

00:33:40.120 --> 00:33:43.990
It's for our friendships,
our relationships, our true,

00:33:43.990 --> 00:33:45.980
authentic social connections.

00:33:45.980 --> 00:33:51.480
So yes, tell someone you love
them today, I think, 'cause--

00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:53.890
I wonder how many people would.

00:33:53.890 --> 00:33:55.140
I kind of love it.

00:33:55.140 --> 00:33:56.230
MILA BERNABO: I love that.

00:33:56.230 --> 00:33:58.592
You should all do that today.

00:33:58.592 --> 00:34:01.349
You have two homework
assignments-- the card

00:34:01.349 --> 00:34:02.640
and tell someone you love them.

00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:04.570
POPPY JAMIE: Yeah,
you know what?

00:34:04.570 --> 00:34:06.850
If you have your phone on
you, why doesn't everybody

00:34:06.850 --> 00:34:10.510
get out their phone and
send one message to someone

00:34:10.510 --> 00:34:12.174
to tell them that
you appreciate them.

00:34:12.174 --> 00:34:14.152
MILA BERNABO: Right
now, in real time.

00:34:14.152 --> 00:34:16.011
POPPY JAMIE: Yeah,
just one, like, thanks.

00:34:16.011 --> 00:34:16.719
Hope you're well.

00:34:16.719 --> 00:34:19.409
If someone's going
through a break-up--

00:34:19.409 --> 00:34:20.320
that kind of thing.

00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:22.317
Thinking of you.

00:34:22.317 --> 00:34:23.650
I heard you were sick last week.

00:34:23.650 --> 00:34:24.989
Are you better?

00:34:24.989 --> 00:34:27.719
I'm sure you have-- you
don't need any more prompts.

00:34:27.719 --> 00:34:30.480
MILA BERNABO: We'll give you
20 seconds [LAUGHS] to come up

00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:31.170
with a very thoughtful message.

00:34:31.170 --> 00:34:31.689
POPPY JAMIE: And
that's what brilliant

00:34:31.689 --> 00:34:34.900
about positive messages, is
they have a boomerang effect.

00:34:34.900 --> 00:34:37.880
You send them and you'll get
a message about being like,

00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:39.639
thank you so much.

00:34:39.639 --> 00:34:42.000
Oh my god, someone actually
thought about me today.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.350
MILA BERNABO: Mm, great.

00:34:44.350 --> 00:34:47.110
I'm also curious, Poppy, where
did you come up with the name?

00:34:47.110 --> 00:34:49.210
And were there other names
you were considering?

00:34:49.210 --> 00:34:50.977
How did Happy Not
Perfect really stick?

00:34:50.977 --> 00:34:52.060
How did that speak to you?

00:34:52.060 --> 00:34:54.300
POPPY JAMIE: Well, Happy
Not Perfect kind of found me

00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:55.449
in a weird sort of way.

00:34:55.449 --> 00:34:58.240
I woke up in the middle
of the night, 3:00 AM.

00:34:58.240 --> 00:35:01.240
And I just was like--
honestly, I was possessed.

00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:03.940
And I just went online and
bought the domain name.

00:35:03.940 --> 00:35:07.270
And I couldn't believe Happy
Not Perfect was free in 2015.

00:35:07.270 --> 00:35:08.869
I was like, that's crazy.

00:35:08.869 --> 00:35:10.660
I didn't even know what
it was going to be.

00:35:10.660 --> 00:35:13.190
I just had these words--
happy not perfect.

00:35:13.190 --> 00:35:17.710
And I just think that I was
really suffering at the time

00:35:17.710 --> 00:35:21.860
from just not
understanding, I suppose,

00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:23.800
and not prioritizing
my own happiness,

00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:26.290
but wanting to be perfect
for everybody around me.

00:35:26.290 --> 00:35:30.150
Whether it was for work or my
friends or family or whatever,

00:35:30.150 --> 00:35:37.130
and I think we can get ourselves
into not helpful patterns.

00:35:37.130 --> 00:35:40.840
I-- and I quote this from
Oprah-- the disease to please.

00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:42.670
And Happy Not Perfect
really spoke to me.

00:35:42.670 --> 00:35:44.320
And I suddenly thought,
my god, imagine

00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:46.300
if I focused on what
made me happy today

00:35:46.300 --> 00:35:48.400
rather than trying
to be perfect.

00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:49.910
Wouldn't life be different?

00:35:49.910 --> 00:35:54.400
And I just thought, well, my
dream would be for everybody

00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:57.040
in this world to see the
words Happy Not Perfect

00:35:57.040 --> 00:36:00.010
every single day, just
to remind them of that.

00:36:00.010 --> 00:36:00.670
You know what?

00:36:00.670 --> 00:36:04.181
Today, your happiness
matters above all else.

00:36:04.181 --> 00:36:04.930
MILA BERNABO: Yep.

00:36:04.930 --> 00:36:06.304
Was there a tipping
point for you

00:36:06.304 --> 00:36:09.700
when you sort of had that
personal experience of hey,

00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:12.174
I'm not happy and I
feel like I'm just

00:36:12.174 --> 00:36:14.090
needing to be perfect
for the world around me.

00:36:14.090 --> 00:36:16.827
Was there a specific moment
or time in your life,

00:36:16.827 --> 00:36:18.160
or was it sort of a progression?

00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:18.970
POPPY JAMIE: You know what?

00:36:18.970 --> 00:36:20.410
I think it's one
of those things.

00:36:20.410 --> 00:36:23.200
Sometimes don't I
think we all realize

00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:25.825
how kind of toxic
our environments

00:36:25.825 --> 00:36:28.320
are until we hit rock bottom.

00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:30.820
And that was really, again,
part of the mission of Happy Not

00:36:30.820 --> 00:36:31.660
Perfect.

00:36:31.660 --> 00:36:34.000
Why do we need to hit
rock bottom to then start

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:35.410
looking after our mind?

00:36:35.410 --> 00:36:37.780
You hit rock bottom and
then you see a therapist.

00:36:37.780 --> 00:36:40.615
You hit rock bottom
then find medication.

00:36:40.615 --> 00:36:43.800
But actually what is your
preventative measures?

00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:45.190
And that was the thing--

00:36:45.190 --> 00:36:46.090
I did.

00:36:46.090 --> 00:36:47.880
I experienced terrible burnout.

00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:49.130
I had to go to hospital.

00:36:49.130 --> 00:36:51.670
I was exhausted for weeks.

00:36:51.670 --> 00:36:53.380
And I thought to
myself, how have

00:36:53.380 --> 00:36:57.450
I let myself get to this point
of being totally adrenally

00:36:57.450 --> 00:37:00.340
fatigued that I'm so burnout
because I've just worked

00:37:00.340 --> 00:37:04.720
every single hour of the day
trying to do my best, which

00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:07.930
was kind of manic, really.

00:37:07.930 --> 00:37:10.270
So yes, so Happy Not
Perfect is also kind

00:37:10.270 --> 00:37:13.680
of the symbol of like, it's OK.

00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:15.480
You can take a breath today.

00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:16.110
You can.

00:37:16.110 --> 00:37:17.818
You're not going to
miss out on anything.

00:37:17.818 --> 00:37:21.030
MILA BERNABO: Wonderful, and
is there a specific challenge

00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:23.820
or thing that you're focusing
on right now in your life that's

00:37:23.820 --> 00:37:24.761
most present for you?

00:37:24.761 --> 00:37:26.760
POPPY JAMIE: Yeah, I'm
trying to, at the moment,

00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:28.700
work on stillness.

00:37:28.700 --> 00:37:32.550
And stillness don't necessarily
mean-- what I'm learning--

00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:34.350
to stay still.

00:37:34.350 --> 00:37:37.020
But actually, be
in flow with life.

00:37:37.020 --> 00:37:39.040
Because let's say kind of your--

00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:41.730
you were looking at something
and all these objects

00:37:41.730 --> 00:37:44.400
were moving at exactly
the same time towards you.

00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:46.910
They would actually look as
if they were kind of still.

00:37:46.910 --> 00:37:50.280
And that's what I'm
really interested in--

00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:53.580
how do we cultivate
kind of more stillness,

00:37:53.580 --> 00:37:57.180
being more aware of just
being in flow with life?

00:37:57.180 --> 00:37:59.400
So yeah, that's what I'm
working on at the moment--

00:37:59.400 --> 00:37:59.970
MILA BERNABO:
Wonderful, I love that.

00:37:59.970 --> 00:38:01.980
POPPY JAMIE: --in this journey.

00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:04.030
MILA BERNABO: All of this is.

00:38:04.030 --> 00:38:09.300
And just to wrap up, are there
any sort of final messages

00:38:09.300 --> 00:38:11.910
or anything you want our
audience to know about the app,

00:38:11.910 --> 00:38:15.370
about the work you're
doing, any takeaways?

00:38:15.370 --> 00:38:17.700
POPPY JAMIE: Please
share the word.

00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:21.690
I just think that really
looking after our mind has

00:38:21.690 --> 00:38:24.210
to be as normal as
looking after our bodies,

00:38:24.210 --> 00:38:26.130
looking after our
teeth, washing our hair.

00:38:26.130 --> 00:38:30.990
It has to be as kind of like
mundane and normal as that.

00:38:30.990 --> 00:38:33.960
And I think we're in
a time in the world

00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:37.800
with so much happening that
it's not only our responsibility

00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:40.500
to look after our own, but
also to encourage people

00:38:40.500 --> 00:38:42.270
to look after theirs, too.

00:38:42.270 --> 00:38:45.300
So look, meditation isn't
always an option for everyone.

00:38:45.300 --> 00:38:47.270
That's why we've
created different tools.

00:38:47.270 --> 00:38:48.750
It is a joint effort.

00:38:48.750 --> 00:38:51.360
We're in this together.

00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:53.560
And look, emotions
are contagious.

00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:56.540
So if my friend starts looking
after their mental well

00:38:56.540 --> 00:38:59.340
being better, it's going to
make me feel better, too.

00:38:59.340 --> 00:39:01.694
So we're very closely--

00:39:01.694 --> 00:39:03.610
human beings are so
delicate and so sensitive,

00:39:03.610 --> 00:39:05.650
and we're so closely
linked to each other.

00:39:05.650 --> 00:39:08.595
So yeah, just we're
in this together.

00:39:08.595 --> 00:39:10.500
MILA BERNABO:
Wonderful, wonderful.

00:39:10.500 --> 00:39:12.240
Thank you, Poppy, so
much for your time,

00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:13.350
for sharing your app.

00:39:13.350 --> 00:39:15.900
Thank you all for coming
and taking a time out

00:39:15.900 --> 00:39:18.560
from your day, taking a
breath-- a belly breath, not

00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:19.310
a shoulder breath.

00:39:19.310 --> 00:39:19.980
POPPY JAMIE: A belly
breath-- oh yeah,

00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:21.980
belly breathing-- that's
the last message, just

00:39:21.980 --> 00:39:23.516
belly breathing, yeah.

00:39:23.516 --> 00:39:25.320
MILA BERNABO: Wonderful,
thank you all,

00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:26.820
and feel free to
stick around if you

00:39:26.820 --> 00:39:29.060
have any questions you want
to ask of Poppy directly

00:39:29.060 --> 00:39:29.760
at the end.

00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:30.260
Thank you.

00:39:30.260 --> 00:39:30.860
[APPLAUSE]

00:39:30.860 --> 00:39:33.260
POPPY JAMIE: Thank you.

00:39:33.260 --> 00:39:35.110
Thank you.
