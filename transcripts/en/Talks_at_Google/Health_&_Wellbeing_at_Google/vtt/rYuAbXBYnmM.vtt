[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:07.540
SPEAKER: Good afternoon.

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:08.160
Namaste.

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.600
Welcome, yodelers, to kirtan,
rocking it at Googleplex today.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.950
I am delighted and honored
to welcome to the Googleplex

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:21.150
the biggest name in kirtan in
the Western world, Krishna Das,

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.114
first time at Google.

00:00:22.114 --> 00:00:23.536
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:26.328 --> 00:00:27.328
KRISHNA DAS: [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:33.200
SPEAKER: No, Krishna Das,
as you will soon find out,

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:39.270
was the most unlikely person to
be the biggest name in kirtan,

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.685
growing up in Long
Island, and his life

00:00:41.685 --> 00:00:43.810
was going lead him on a
different trajectory, which

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.780
he'll talk about it a minute.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.120
And he left for India
at the encouragement

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.820
of one of his close friends,
former Harvard Professor

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.700
Richard Alpert, now known
famously as Ram Das.

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.720
And Krishna Das met his
teacher Neem Karoli Baba there

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:04.530
and stayed there.

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.230
And in his own words, he
says, in a manner of speaking,

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:09.420
he never came back.

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.990
And here we are
in the year 2017,

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.040
when he's put kirtan
firmly on the global map.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.920
He's had 16 albums to
his credit, a bestselling

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.920
documentary, "One Track Heart."

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.760
And a few years ago,
his album "Live Ananda"

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.810
was nominated for the Grammy
award in the New Age category.

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.935
KRISHNA DAS: Should have
been the old age category.

00:01:31.935 --> 00:01:33.062
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.340
SPEAKER: And so here to tell
us the story about his journey

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.320
and what led him to
this point in life,

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.840
bringing this amazing
music to all of us,

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.690
please welcome to the stage once
again, Krishna Das at Google.

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:47.076
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:49.386 --> 00:01:51.700
KRISHNA DAS: Thanks.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.980
SPEAKER: So Krishna Das,
I have been pondering

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:56.390
about a great mystery of life.

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.350
And I thought you might be the
best person to answer that.

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:01.310
KRISHNA DAS: Good luck.

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:02.260
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.810
SPEAKER: So how does a Jewish
boy growing up in Long Island

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.436
end up becoming the
biggest name in kirtan?

00:02:11.436 --> 00:02:11.935
How?

00:02:14.524 --> 00:02:15.440
KRISHNA DAS: Bad luck.

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:16.304
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.870
You know, it's not
about names or anything.

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.717
I lived in India
for a long time.

00:02:23.717 --> 00:02:25.550
And I thought I was
never going to come back

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.740
to America when I left.

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.170
After 2 1/2 years, my
guru looked at me one day,

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.810
and he said, go back.

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.351
I said, but I'm
just learning Hindi.

00:02:34.351 --> 00:02:34.850
Too bad.

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:36.770
Go.

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:37.720
So I had to come back.

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.178
He said, you have
attachment there.

00:02:39.178 --> 00:02:41.210
You have to go back.

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:44.270
Little did I know
what I was facing.

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:45.890
So he sent me back.

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.310
And many years went by.

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.190
And I was struggling
a lot with depression.

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.070
I went through a lot of--

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:57.860
all the things I
couldn't do before I

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.780
went to India
because I was scared,

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.550
I did afterwards like
drugs, rock and roll.

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:09.890
Every possible bit of trouble
I could get into, I got into.

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:12.350
But I managed to
survive it mostly.

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:19.430
And 20 years or so
after my guru died,

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:20.960
I was in my room in New York.

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:26.590
And I was very, very
depressed, very, very unhappy.

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.940
And I walked out
into the living room,

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.780
and I was actually struck
like a lightning bolt.

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.680
And I knew immediately that
if I did not start singing

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.270
with people, and it was with
people, that I would never

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:44.000
be able to clean out the
dark corners of my own heart

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.800
and the shadows in my life.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.410
It's just that the
only thing I had that

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:50.270
would work for me was
the chanting that I

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:54.470
had done in India and was
doing a little bit of kind

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.650
of privately.

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:58.940
And that was a big thing
because first of all,

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.670
I didn't want to do it.

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:05.630
But when you know something,
you know something.

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:08.030
And you can tell
yourself you don't know.

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:11.510
But you know, and
you know you know.

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:12.560
So it took me a while.

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:17.320
And I called a couple of
yoga studios in New York.

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.540
This is in 1994.

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:23.330
And I said blah, blah,
blah, I was in India.

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:24.020
I used to sing.

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.725
Could I come chant
at your place?

00:04:26.725 --> 00:04:28.100
Well, one place said no.

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.940
[LAUGHS]

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:31.229
They regret that now.

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:33.270
They keep saying, can you
come sing at our place?

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.770
Nah.

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:35.880
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.359
No, they've become friends too.

00:04:37.359 --> 00:04:38.900
But the other place
said, yeah, sure.

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:39.740
Come on Mondays.

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.365
We have these little
gatherings on Mondays

00:04:42.365 --> 00:04:46.580
where we read from holy
books and take questions.

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:48.380
So I went.

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:51.900
And for a couple of months,
I'd go every Monday.

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.990
And I'd sing for
about 20 minutes.

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:55.959
And then the two owners--

00:04:55.959 --> 00:04:56.750
this was Jivamukti.

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:57.310
SPEAKER: How big
was your audience?

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:57.820
KRISHNA DAS: Huh?

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:59.320
SPEAKER: How many
people were there?

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:00.770
KRISHNA DAS: Eight.

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:02.090
On a good night, nine maybe.

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:04.190
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:09.830
And so that the two owners of
Jivamukti, David and Sharon--

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:14.439
two months later, I came there,
and they had gone to India.

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:15.980
I didn't even know
they were leaving.

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:16.563
They had gone.

00:05:16.563 --> 00:05:19.250
So I sang for a couple hours.

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:21.916
And they wound up-- they stayed
gone for about three months.

00:05:21.916 --> 00:05:24.290
So every Monday that I was in
New York, I would be there,

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:27.200
and had just gotten used
to singing for a long time.

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:30.020
Well, one day, they showed up.

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:31.760
And we all sat
together in the front.

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:33.410
And they said, you start.

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:34.870
I said, OK.

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:36.590
So I started chanting.

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:38.660
And about an hour later,
I realized, oh, shit.

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:40.220
They're here.

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:42.032
And I went like--

00:05:42.032 --> 00:05:44.240
and they looked at each
other and said, keep singing.

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:45.031
And so that was it.

00:05:45.031 --> 00:05:47.900
Mondays became my night.

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:50.710
And it just started to--

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:52.760
people just started to come.

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:53.840
There was no advertising.

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.910
There was nothing.

00:05:55.910 --> 00:06:01.550
And the key to it all-- and
still is the reason I sing,

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:05.720
how I started singing, and
every moment that I do sing,

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.580
I am singing for
one reason only--

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:12.950
to save my miserable
ass and no other reason.

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:14.960
I'm not trying to
get anybody off.

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:16.670
It's not entertainment.

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:18.020
This is my practice.

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:20.150
This is what I do
to save my life.

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:24.960
Every day, every time I
sit down, it's about that.

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:28.610
And so that intensity
is kind of transmitted,

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:30.800
I think, to some degree.

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:34.790
And besides, I sing what I like,
because when I started singing,

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:35.600
nobody was there.

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:36.320
So what do you sing?

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:37.278
You sing what you like.

00:06:37.278 --> 00:06:39.920
And that never changed.

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:42.370
It seems like other people
kind of liked it too.

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:44.019
So I keep doing it.

00:06:44.019 --> 00:06:45.560
SPEAKER: So a few
years ago you, were

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:48.330
singing at the Dolores
Church in San Francisco

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:51.050
with Larry Brilliant, who at
the time was CEO of Google.

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:52.650
KRISHNA DAS: Yeah, Larry
and I were in India together

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:53.090
a long time.

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:54.720
SPEAKER: Yeah, you were
on the ashram together.

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:56.400
And I remember
you telling Larry,

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:59.465
where the church
was full, you said,

00:06:59.465 --> 00:07:00.840
they're not here
to listen to me.

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:02.700
They are here to help me sing.

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:05.670
I need them more
than they need me.

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:07.450
So what is the
singing experience?

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:09.750
I notice that your eyes
are closed and seem

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:11.570
to be in a meditative,
trance-like state

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:14.430
the entire concert.

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:16.590
KRISHNA DAS: You think so.

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:17.840
Yeah, very deep trance.

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:19.770
SPEAKER: You can fake it well.

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:20.520
KRISHNA DAS: Yeah.

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:23.710
Well, it's very simple.

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:27.060
These chants traditionally,
for many, many years,

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:31.230
have been done as
a way of deepening

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:38.010
your awareness of what's
inside of us, what's

00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:42.210
underneath our thoughts, what's
underneath our emotions, what's

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:43.780
always present.

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:45.725
It's a kind of awareness.

00:07:45.725 --> 00:07:47.730
Now, most of the time,
we're totally lost.

00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:51.450
We're, like, in
dreamland all day long.

00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:52.230
We're thinking.

00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:53.670
We're imagining.

00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:54.630
We're fantasizing.

00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:56.100
We're remembering.

00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:59.380
But we're never aware
of what we're doing.

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:02.310
So what we do is
we add something

00:08:02.310 --> 00:08:06.360
to that daily experience.

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:09.210
So you pick a
chant, or a mantra,

00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:14.660
or an object of concentration,
if it's a meditative practice.

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:17.220
And every time you notice that
you're not paying attention

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:23.820
to what you just agreed to do
with yourself, you come back.

00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:24.330
You're gone.

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:24.870
You come back.

00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:27.411
Like when we chant-- we're going
to chant in a little while--

00:08:27.411 --> 00:08:29.830
you will see, if you're
paying attention,

00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:34.809
that you might be able to
pay attention for 10 seconds.

00:08:34.809 --> 00:08:37.350
I mean, if you
really, really try it.

00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:40.970
And then you won't be there,
until you recognize, oh, I've

00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:44.230
just been gone for five minutes.

00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:45.780
You come back.

00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:48.330
So what we're doing,
we're retraining.

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:51.600
And this is not a learning
situation, this is training.

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:54.450
In Tibetan Buddhism, they
call it mind training.

00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:55.650
You're training yourself.

00:08:55.650 --> 00:09:00.090
You're creating new channels
in the brain actually.

00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:01.860
You've read about
neuroplasticity.

00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:03.564
This is actually true.

00:09:03.564 --> 00:09:04.980
The brain, the
shape of the brain,

00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:07.080
changes with these practices.

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:11.220
So we're training ourselves
to keep coming back much

00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:14.106
more quickly as time goes on.

00:09:14.106 --> 00:09:15.480
And we don't get
lost in thought.

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:19.260
We don't get lost in our
emotions the same way as time

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:20.610
goes on.

00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:23.040
It's not about trying to
have any particular kind

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:27.250
of blissful practice
or blissful feeling.

00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:29.305
It's dealing with
whatever arises.

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:35.010
People think that if
they try to meditate

00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:37.206
and they feel like shit
afterwards, it didn't work.

00:09:37.206 --> 00:09:38.580
But if you really
feel like shit,

00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:43.689
it probably worked, because
you were paying attention.

00:09:43.689 --> 00:09:45.480
SPEAKER: I think it
works for me every day.

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:46.830
KRISHNA DAS: Very good.

00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:48.470
That is your true
nature, my friend.

00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:53.340
SPEAKER: [LAUGHS] So
one final question.

00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:56.280
How do you explain this
very esoteric practice, even

00:09:56.280 --> 00:10:00.390
considered like just a folk
music style that originated

00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:03.450
in India, suddenly becomes so
popular all over the world,

00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:07.890
and kirtan music festivals
in California are full?

00:10:07.890 --> 00:10:10.080
KRISHNA DAS: People
ask me all the time.

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:12.345
They say, I want to share
my music with the world.

00:10:12.345 --> 00:10:12.970
How do I do it?

00:10:12.970 --> 00:10:14.550
And I say, I don't know.

00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:17.340
I just started singing,
and everything happened.

00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:18.360
I had no plan.

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:21.240
I wasn't trying to--

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:23.880
I wasn't trying to do
anything except save myself.

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:27.570
And this is what I
had to do to do that.

00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:28.620
And so far, it's worked.

00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:29.578
I mean, you never know.

00:10:29.578 --> 00:10:31.650
Tomorrow's another day.

00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:35.310
But as far as the
music goes, when

00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:37.550
I first came back and
started singing with people,

00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:41.010
I sang the melodies that I had
learned singing with people

00:10:41.010 --> 00:10:43.560
in India, Indian melodies.

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:46.650
But the longer I
was away from India,

00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:49.380
my true nature
kind of took over,

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:51.930
which is basically
rock and roll.

00:10:51.930 --> 00:10:55.310
I grew up in the
late '50s and '60s.

00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:58.050
And rock and roll was
very important to me,

00:10:58.050 --> 00:10:59.610
very important.

00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:03.510
And all those emotional
feelings that I

00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:08.280
had with that kind
of music had been

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:12.060
transmitted and transformed
with this practice.

00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:14.760
But it comes out sounding
like rock and roll

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:16.825
with this little
squeezebox here.

00:11:16.825 --> 00:11:18.700
It doesn't sound the
same when I play guitar.

00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:21.210
I can't chant with a guitar.

00:11:21.210 --> 00:11:22.990
But when I sit down
with this, it's weird.

00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:25.180
I don't know what it is.

00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:26.920
So there was no plan.

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:28.800
I don't know.

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:35.910
The chord changes have a
kind of emotional power.

00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:39.780
And they push buttons in us.

00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:44.610
But the real gist
of this practice

00:11:44.610 --> 00:11:47.280
is what we are chanting.

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:51.660
You know, if a baby is sick
and has to take medicine,

00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:55.380
the medicine, you usually
hide it in a sweet syrup

00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:58.980
so it's easier to take.

00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:03.300
So in this case, the
syrup is the music.

00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:06.570
But the medicine is what we're
chanting, which in India, they

00:12:06.570 --> 00:12:10.420
call the names of God,
or the divine names.

00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:13.015
We're not required to
believe there's a God.

00:12:13.015 --> 00:12:14.640
We're not required
to believe anything.

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:19.410
But if we do want our
lives to be transformed,

00:12:19.410 --> 00:12:25.920
and if we do want to become good
human beings on this planet,

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:28.680
at this time, in
this world right now,

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:31.660
some practice has to be done.

00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:34.830
Otherwise, we're at the mercy
of all our negative emotions

00:12:34.830 --> 00:12:36.510
at any time.

00:12:36.510 --> 00:12:40.200
We have no vote how
we go through the day.

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:43.320
If we want to get a vote,
some practice has to be done.

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:45.240
There's no two ways about it.

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:46.710
I'm sorry.

00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:50.430
I mean, I wish it could just be
better, like you push a button.

00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:51.420
But it isn't.

00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:53.040
We have to train
ourselves to let

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:57.240
go of our negative emotions,
the negative stories we

00:12:57.240 --> 00:13:04.250
tell ourselves about ourselves
all day long, which we believe.

00:13:04.250 --> 00:13:07.320
We believe everything we think.

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:12.030
This is the definition
of insanity, really.

00:13:12.030 --> 00:13:13.920
And so through
these practices, we

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:17.630
get a vote as to how we
respond to our own thoughts,

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:19.020
to our own emotions.

00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:25.260
And we don't necessarily
continue to be ruled by them.

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:27.240
But you have to do a practice.

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:29.700
Otherwise, you
have to find a way

00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:31.650
of changing the
way the direction

00:13:31.650 --> 00:13:35.272
that that river of
thought is going.

00:13:35.272 --> 00:13:36.230
Anyway, enough of that.

00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:36.690
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:13:36.690 --> 00:13:38.106
Thank you for the
profound wisdom.

00:13:38.106 --> 00:13:39.890
KRISHNA DAS: Yes, very profound.

00:13:39.890 --> 00:13:42.780
SPEAKER: Googlers will be happy
to know that Krishna Das has

00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:44.670
actually taken
this ancient wisdom

00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:48.100
and brought it to modern times
using digital technology.

00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:50.040
He is a YouTube creator.

00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:51.780
His channel is
Krishna Das Music.

00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:56.280
And periodically, he's at the
YouTube studios in New York

00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:58.001
to record a series called chai--

00:13:58.001 --> 00:13:59.250
KRISHNA DAS: "Chai and Chats."

00:13:59.250 --> 00:13:59.749
People come.

00:13:59.749 --> 00:14:02.130
And they have a little
set there at the studios

00:14:02.130 --> 00:14:06.060
of a diner, a '50s diner
with a little jukebox thing.

00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:06.840
So people come.

00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:08.010
And we make chai.

00:14:08.010 --> 00:14:09.110
And we sit and talk.

00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:11.144
It's great.

00:14:11.144 --> 00:14:13.560
SPEAKER: But we didn't come
here to hear Krishna Das talk,

00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:14.355
did we?

00:14:14.355 --> 00:14:15.540
We want to hear him sing.

00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:17.850
So we will move on to kirtan.

00:14:17.850 --> 00:14:22.170
And joining him on stage will be
his group, Arjun on the tabla,

00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:25.730
general walker on the violin,
and Nina Rao, his manager,

00:14:25.730 --> 00:14:28.140
on khartals and backup vocals.

00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:30.439
Please welcome Krishna
Das and his band.

00:14:30.439 --> 00:14:32.355
[APPLAUSE]

00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:45.930
KRISHNA DAS: So once again, the
instructions are very simple.

00:14:45.930 --> 00:14:47.100
You repeat.

00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:47.860
I sing a line.

00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:49.885
And then you all
sing something that

00:14:49.885 --> 00:14:52.260
sounds something like something
I might've sung sometime.

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:54.040
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:57.160
And then we keep
going back and forth.

00:14:57.160 --> 00:15:00.160
And when you notice that
you're not paying attention--

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:01.630
don't try too hard.

00:15:01.630 --> 00:15:03.640
But when you notice you're
not paying attention,

00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:06.616
just simply come
back to the chanting.

00:15:06.616 --> 00:15:08.740
And you might sit here for
10 minutes just thinking

00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:11.110
about other stuff
until you notice

00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:12.820
that that's what you're doing.

00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:14.500
It's an amazing
moment, that moment

00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:19.600
when you notice that you've
been gone for x amount of time.

00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:22.270
It's a miracle that we
ever come back actually.

00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:32.260
We'll sing a chant, Shri
Ram Jay Ram Jay Jay Ram.

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:34.700
It's in your hymnals, yeah.

00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:38.200
Shri Ram Jay Ram Jay Jay
Ram, and Sita Ram Sita Ram.

00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:39.160
So I'll sing a line.

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:41.730
And then if you
like, you can answer.

00:15:41.730 --> 00:15:43.390
We'll go back and
forth for a while.

It's what humans do.

00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:40.990
But it's very hard to
change that pattern.

00:36:40.990 --> 00:36:45.460
So you have to add
some other dimension.

00:36:45.460 --> 00:36:48.590
And that is simply paying
attention, coming back.

00:36:48.590 --> 00:36:50.740
And then you start to
recognize things from inside.

00:36:50.740 --> 00:36:52.990
And nobody has to tell you.

00:36:52.990 --> 00:36:55.410

they come at the same thing.

it mean when you do that?

And he went-- like that.

00:37:40.670 --> 00:37:42.600
What does that mean?

00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:49.160
He said, many names, many
forms, all one, all one.

00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:54.840
So that's where he
lived, in that oneness.

00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:58.350
And these names are the names
of that place inside of us

00:37:58.350 --> 00:38:00.652
that is that.

00:38:00.652 --> 00:38:06.570

It's not good for you.

00:39:25.990 --> 00:39:29.730
So I'm going to start with a
couple of verses in English.

00:39:29.730 --> 00:39:32.790
There was a great hymn written
many years ago by a great saint

00:39:32.790 --> 00:39:35.180
called Shankaracharya.

00:39:35.180 --> 00:39:37.670
He was walking down
the street one day.

00:39:37.670 --> 00:39:40.340
And he saw an old man
on the side of the road

00:39:40.340 --> 00:39:44.496
teaching rules of Sanskrit
grammar to some students.

00:39:44.496 --> 00:39:45.870
And being a great
saint, he could

00:39:45.870 --> 00:39:48.980
see that this old guy was
going to die very soon,

00:39:48.980 --> 00:39:50.840
and he'd never
done any practice,

00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:53.006
anything to help himself.

00:39:53.006 --> 00:39:54.630
So out of compassion,
he went up to him

00:39:54.630 --> 00:39:59.300
and he said, oh, my
friend, bhaja govinda.

00:39:59.300 --> 00:40:02.090
So "govinda" means
"Krishna," the name of God.

00:40:02.090 --> 00:40:05.430
And "bhaja" means "to sing
or praise or remember."

00:40:05.430 --> 00:40:09.200
So he's telling this guy, do
something before it's too late.

00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:10.430
And that night, he went home.

00:40:10.430 --> 00:40:14.410
And he wrote a long hymn that
he called "Bhaja Govinda."

00:40:14.410 --> 00:40:17.930
And each verse
describes the ways

00:40:17.930 --> 00:40:21.221
that we go through our lives
complete asleep, totally lost

00:40:21.221 --> 00:40:22.220
in whatever we're doing.

00:40:22.220 --> 00:40:23.180
And we never wake up.

00:40:23.180 --> 00:40:27.260
And we never do what's really
in our own best interests.

00:40:27.260 --> 00:40:29.192
And we don't get
the things we want.

00:40:29.192 --> 00:40:30.650
We don't get the
happiness we want.

00:40:30.650 --> 00:40:33.680
We don't find the love.

00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:36.230
And then the chorus at the
end of each verse went, "Oh,

00:40:36.230 --> 00:40:38.860
my foolish mind
or foolish heart."

00:40:38.860 --> 00:40:42.250
Bhaja govinda, do something.

00:40:42.250 --> 00:40:46.430
So I always wanted to read--
it's a beautiful poem.

00:40:46.430 --> 00:40:49.520
And I always wanted to
rewrite it with modern images

00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:55.220
because they didn't have
binge watching in 900,

00:40:55.220 --> 00:40:57.300
whenever Shankaracharya lived.

00:40:57.300 --> 00:41:00.710
That's how I waste
most of my time.

00:41:00.710 --> 00:41:03.196
But I'm too lazy,
and it's too long.

00:41:03.196 --> 00:41:04.320
And so that never happened.

00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:06.025
So I wrote a couple
of new verses--
