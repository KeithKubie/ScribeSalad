00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.040
Here's an example of a very simple
anomaly detection approach.

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.900
First, it establishes
the normal statistical

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:10.290
runtime profile of a program.

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.870
For example, in terms of CPU
utilization, memory size, etc.

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.750
This can be accomplished by
running the program many times.

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.610
And at each time, record the values
of these measurements and

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:26.420
then compute the means and variance.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.330
Once the profile or
detection model is built,

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:34.720
when the IDS observes that when
the program is run, it's measures

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:40.350
deviate from the means beyond
the allowed thresholds or the variance.

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.700
Meaning that the values are outside
of their normal ranges.

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.460
The ideas outputs an alert.

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:52.570
Again, the main drawback of
anomaly detection approach is that

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.460
you can produce relatively
high false positive rate

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.910
because an anomaly can just be a new or
observed normal activity.
