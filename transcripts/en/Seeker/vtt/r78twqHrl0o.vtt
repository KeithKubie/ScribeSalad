00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.220
Today, mummies live in museums, movies and
in our nightmares, but how did ancient animals

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:15.700
get mummified without help from humans!?

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:20.930
In the summer of 2015, a pair of mummified
lions were found in the Sakha (Yakutia) Republic

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:21.930
in Northern Russia.

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.460
Though they don’t look it, these lions are
10,000 years old, they were naturally mummified

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.770
by ice!

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:30.070
These mummified cubs are gobsmacking.

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:35.070
Usually, time and nature leave only bone fragments,
parts of skeletons (like skulls or teeth),

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.690
and MAYBE a carcass.

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.809
But these lions look as if they fell asleep
just yesterday, but they didn’t.

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:44.089
These are long extinct.

00:00:44.089 --> 00:00:48.249
Lions like these were found from Britain,
across Eurasia all the way northwestern Canada

00:00:48.249 --> 00:00:52.420
during the Pleistocene (plice-ta-scene) era
— 1.6M to about 10,000 years ago!

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.640
The area where they were found has produced
a beautifully horrible looking carcass of

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.760
an Oimyakon mammoth (Oy-my-akon), called Yuka,
as well as bison, wooly rhinoceroses, and

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:07.490
horses, but the researchers from the Academy
of Science of the Republic of Sakha are confident

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.210
these are the most well-preserved animals
ever found.

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.280
Natural mummies are an accident of the environment
of their death.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:20.860
They're related to TP-wrapped customers or
classic horror films, but for scientists,

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.840
mummification is the failure of bacteria to
break down soft tissues after death.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:31.390
See, normally, when something dies, the bacteria
in, on, and around it immediately begin to

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:32.490
break it down.

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.880
Organs digest themselves in a process called
autolysis, and eventually, bodies reach the

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:42.280
putrefaction phase, where bacteria anaerobically
digest the tissue -- or use oxygen to break

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.360
it down.

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.850
A few months later the body is just a skeleton.

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.240
But, sometimes, when conditions are JUST RIGHT,
these bacteria never get to do their jobs,

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.430
and the organism dies and simply dries out.

00:01:53.430 --> 00:02:00.000
In cold, dry conditions the whole process
slows, and the body can freeze before bacteria

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.430
are able to grow and eat away at the corpse.

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.420
For example, Özti the Iceman, the oldest,
most well-preserved human ever found, was

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:12.069
discovered on the Italian Alps in 1991 after
falling dead under a rocky outcropping.

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:17.099
He was quickly covered with snow, creating
conditions for him to mummify.

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:19.790
The dry desert climate can cause mummification
as well!

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.430
Prior to "inventing" mummies as we know them
from museums today, early Egyptians would

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.510
bury their dead in small pits.

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.760
The high heat coupled with a lack of moisture
caused dehydration and mummification to happen

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.159
naturally in a process called desiccation!

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:41.520
Once all the moisture was gone, the bacteria
would halt their work.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.849
Only later did Egyptians start developing
a mummification process as they tried to build

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:49.439
tombs, and found the bodies would decay too
quickly.

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:54.319
The hot, dry sand was part of the process!

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:58.540
The oldest artificially mummified bodies come
from Chile!

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.319
They're 6500 years old and were placed in
the Atacama Desert by the Chinchorro people

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:06.599
complete with wigs and mats for their eternal
sleep.

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:11.980
Aside from hot and dry, or cold and dry, mummies
can also naturally form in peat bogs.

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:17.290
A "peat bog" is a form of wetland that accumulates
dead plant material called peat.

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:23.909
The soil in peat bogs is saturated, acidic,
and low in nutrients; which creates a very

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:28.409
uninviting place for oxygen-based anaerobic
digestion of biomatter.

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:32.840
Though bog mummies aren't as beautiful as
those found frozen in glaciers or buried in

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.670
deserts; the tissues simply aren't as well
preserved.

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:40.610
According to Archaeologist and Anthropologist
Mark Spigelman the tissue of frozen Korean

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:46.870
mummies, is soft and pliable, while heat-dried
Egyptian mummies feel more like paper.

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:51.819
Deserts produce the BEST mummies because they
desiccate tissues so quickly!

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:54.939
If you pay attention, you'll realize mummies
are found all the time!

00:03:54.939 --> 00:04:00.689
Famous mummies have been found frozen in Greenland,
Siberia, and Canada, Korea or dehydrated in

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:03.309
Egypt, Nevada or the Atacama!

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:07.299
Some mummies are so well preserved they look
like they've only been dead a few days, like

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:10.879
the Qilakitsoq Inuit (Kila-kit-sock) mummies
found in 1972.

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:18.090
Six women and two children died under an sheltered
overhanging rock which freeze-dried their

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.280
remains, including their clothing and soft
tissues.

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.150
The younger of the children was only a baby,
and was so well preserved he looks like a

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.960
doll, but is (in fact) more than 500 years
old.

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.390
Mummies can show us what humans or animals
looked like, how they lived, what they ate,

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:39.110
how they walked, and on and on because it's
the best resource we have for peering into

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:40.110
the past.

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:44.729
A natural mummy found in China's Taklamakan
Desert (Takla-Mahkan) revealed 3000 years

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:51.360
ago, that people living in there were Indo-Europeans,
settling even before the Han Chinese arrived!

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.240
This discovery completely changed the history
of region.

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.930
In the end, the most common natural mummies
come from hot and dry climes, as the freezing

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:01.840
or peat processes tend not to happen fast
enough.

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.729
What will we'll learn from these 10,000 year
old lions?

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:06.210
Ironically, time will tell.

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:08.479
But for now, that’s a wrap!

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:09.479
