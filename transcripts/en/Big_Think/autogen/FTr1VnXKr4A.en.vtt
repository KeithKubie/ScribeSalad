00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.819
 
one of the things I study in my lab is

00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:01.829
one of the things I study in my lab is
 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:04.120
one of the things I study in my lab is
called synesthesia and it represents a

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:04.130
called synesthesia and it represents a
 

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:07.519
called synesthesia and it represents a
blending of the senses so we've all

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529
blending of the senses so we've all
 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:09.440
blending of the senses so we've all
heard the word anesthesia which means no

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450
heard the word anesthesia which means no
 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.230
heard the word anesthesia which means no
feeling synesthesia means joined feeling

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240
feeling synesthesia means joined feeling
 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.690
feeling synesthesia means joined feeling
so somebody with synesthesia they might

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700
so somebody with synesthesia they might
 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.029
so somebody with synesthesia they might
hear music and it causes them to see

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039
hear music and it causes them to see
 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.849
hear music and it causes them to see
colors physically or they might hear

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859
colors physically or they might hear
 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.230
colors physically or they might hear
something and it puts a taste in their

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240
something and it puts a taste in their
 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.759
something and it puts a taste in their
mouth physically they're experiencing

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769
mouth physically they're experiencing
 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.240
mouth physically they're experiencing
that or they might eat something and it

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250
that or they might eat something and it
 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.060
that or they might eat something and it
puts a feeling on their fingertips the

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070
puts a feeling on their fingertips the
 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.849
puts a feeling on their fingertips the
most common forms of synesthesia have to

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859
most common forms of synesthesia have to
 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.790
most common forms of synesthesia have to
do with overlearn sequences like letters

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800
do with overlearn sequences like letters
 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.729
do with overlearn sequences like letters
or numbers or week days or months

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:36.739
or numbers or week days or months
 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:39.650
or numbers or week days or months
triggering a color experience so

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660
triggering a color experience so
 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.030
triggering a color experience so
somebody might look at the number six

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040
somebody might look at the number six
 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.090
somebody might look at the number six
and that's read to that synesthete or

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100
and that's read to that synesthete or
 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.580
and that's read to that synesthete or
they look at the the letter J and that's

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590
they look at the the letter J and that's
 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.830
they look at the the letter J and that's
purple and it's an internal experience

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840
purple and it's an internal experience
 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.740
purple and it's an internal experience
it's automatic it's involuntary and it's

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750
it's automatic it's involuntary and it's
 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.650
it's automatic it's involuntary and it's
unconscious and to a synesthete it's

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660
unconscious and to a synesthete it's
 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.569
unconscious and to a synesthete it's
just self-evidently true that J is

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579
just self-evidently true that J is
 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.860
just self-evidently true that J is
purple and it used to be thought this

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870
purple and it used to be thought this
 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.229
purple and it used to be thought this
was very rare the original estimates for

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239
was very rare the original estimates for
 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.299
was very rare the original estimates for
one in 20,000 but we now know it's quite

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309
one in 20,000 but we now know it's quite
 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.280
one in 20,000 but we now know it's quite
common it's probably up to four percent

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290
common it's probably up to four percent
 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.429
common it's probably up to four percent
of the population has some form of

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439
of the population has some form of
 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.200
of the population has some form of
synesthesia there are many different

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210
synesthesia there are many different
 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.109
synesthesia there are many different
forms essentially any Cross blending of

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119
forms essentially any Cross blending of
 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.210
forms essentially any Cross blending of
the senses that you can think of my

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220
the senses that you can think of my
 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.740
the senses that you can think of my
colleagues and I have found a case

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750
colleagues and I have found a case
 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.070
colleagues and I have found a case
somewhere so so we now know it's very

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080
somewhere so so we now know it's very
 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.719
somewhere so so we now know it's very
common and the reason it's so

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729
common and the reason it's so
 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.090
common and the reason it's so
interesting to me is because it's a very

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100
interesting to me is because it's a very
 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.899
interesting to me is because it's a very
good inroad into understanding how

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909
good inroad into understanding how
 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.300
good inroad into understanding how
different brains can be can perceive

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310
different brains can be can perceive
 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.880
different brains can be can perceive
reality differently so you're sitting

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890
reality differently so you're sitting
 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.410
reality differently so you're sitting
here your neighbors sitting here and

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420
here your neighbors sitting here and
 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.120
here your neighbors sitting here and
you're both looking at the same thing

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130
you're both looking at the same thing
 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.219
you're both looking at the same thing
and yet you're seeing the world very

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229
and yet you're seeing the world very
 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.330
and yet you're seeing the world very
differently and it turns out synesthesia

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340
differently and it turns out synesthesia
 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.270
differently and it turns out synesthesia
is heritable so my lab is pulling the

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280
is heritable so my lab is pulling the
 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.560
is heritable so my lab is pulling the
genes for it right now

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570
genes for it right now
 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.050
genes for it right now
and and the reason that's so interesting

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060
and and the reason that's so interesting
 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.639
and and the reason that's so interesting
is because it's it's what I'm calling

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649
is because it's it's what I'm calling
 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.399
is because it's it's what I'm calling
perceptual genomics which is to say how

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409
perceptual genomics which is to say how
 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.850
perceptual genomics which is to say how
do little genetic changes change the way

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860
do little genetic changes change the way
 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.170
do little genetic changes change the way
we perceive reality so you know and of

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180
we perceive reality so you know and of
 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.130
we perceive reality so you know and of
course most synesthetes historically

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140
course most synesthetes historically
 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.260
course most synesthetes historically
have have lived their whole lives and

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270
have have lived their whole lives and
 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.330
have have lived their whole lives and
they may even die without ever

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340
they may even die without ever
 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.580
they may even die without ever
suspecting that they're seeing reality

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590
suspecting that they're seeing reality
 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.140
suspecting that they're seeing reality
differently than someone else because we

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150
differently than someone else because we
 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.479
differently than someone else because we
all accept the reality presented to us

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489
all accept the reality presented to us
 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:22.460
all accept the reality presented to us
so synesthesia is a really direct way to

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470
so synesthesia is a really direct way to
 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.820
so synesthesia is a really direct way to
look at how individual changes can lead

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830
look at how individual changes can lead
 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.870
look at how individual changes can lead
to different beliefs about reality
