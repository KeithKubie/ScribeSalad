00:00:04.837 --> 00:00:06.372
 - Men are struggling.

00:00:06.405 --> 00:00:07.940
Chewing with their mouths open,

00:00:07.973 --> 00:00:12.345 align:start size:88% position:13%
sexual harassment,
being, um, Shia LaBeouf.

00:00:12.378 --> 00:00:14.480
 Thankfully, I'm here to help.

00:00:14.513 --> 00:00:15.982
Now why am I qualified?

00:00:16.015 --> 00:00:17.817 align:start size:88% position:13%
 'Cause I got a gender
 neutral hair cut,

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.921
 a popular podcast, and
 I've had scoliosis.

00:00:21.954 --> 00:00:24.223 size:88% position:44%
  Welcome to Man Up.

00:00:24.256 --> 00:00:27.260 size:88% position:44%
 (upbeat rock music)

00:00:30.996 --> 00:00:33.032 align:start size:88% position:13%
 This week we're
 talking about stress.

00:00:33.065 --> 00:00:35.301
 You know, the silent killer.

00:00:35.334 --> 00:00:37.703 size:84% position:42%
  It's like a hungry mouse
  inside of a cheese heart.

00:00:37.736 --> 00:00:39.806
I got a call from Josh,
one of our long time

00:00:39.839 --> 00:00:42.809 align:start position:0%
 listeners, and he says he's
 seriously stressed out.

00:00:42.842 --> 00:00:45.678
And, seriously appears
to be an understatement.

00:00:45.711 --> 00:00:47.413 align:start size:88% position:13%
Let's take a look,
baby, get that head up.

00:00:47.446 --> 00:00:51.851 size:84% position:42%
  (yelling)
  (hitting)

00:00:51.884 --> 00:00:53.953 size:88% position:44%
  Josh really needed
  a new way to relax

00:00:53.986 --> 00:00:56.656
 and I knew exactly what to do.

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:59.259
 (upbeat music)

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.061
 Theo.

00:01:02.094 --> 00:01:03.196
- Josh.

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.996 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - Yeah, nice to
 finally meet you man.

00:01:04.029 --> 00:01:04.931 size:88% position:44%
 - Nice to meet you.

00:01:04.964 --> 00:01:06.199 size:84% position:42%
  - Yeah, how's everything?

00:01:06.232 --> 00:01:06.866
 - I'm doing as best
 as can be, you know.

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:07.800
 - [Theo] Yeah.

00:01:07.833 --> 00:01:08.334
- Morning traffic and all that.

00:01:08.367 --> 00:01:09.569
- Yeah.

00:01:09.602 --> 00:01:10.236
 Yeah, man, thank you
 for making the drive.

00:01:10.269 --> 00:01:10.937
I appreciate it.

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:11.871
 - No problem.

00:01:11.904 --> 00:01:13.573
 - So I know you reached out.

00:01:13.606 --> 00:01:15.374 align:start size:88% position:13%
 A lot of stress going
 on in your life.

00:01:15.407 --> 00:01:16.242 size:88% position:44%
  What's going on with that?

00:01:16.275 --> 00:01:17.510
 - Um.

00:01:17.543 --> 00:01:20.546
 About 14 years ago, I
 was planning on making

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:24.817 align:start position:0%
 a road trip to all the
 open major league try outs.

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:25.651
- For baseball?

00:01:25.684 --> 00:01:26.919
- For baseball.

00:01:26.952 --> 00:01:28.421
 And I was working at
 (bleep) Electronics,

00:01:28.454 --> 00:01:30.490 size:88% position:44%
  and I had half a palette
  of computers following me.

00:01:30.523 --> 00:01:31.424 size:88% position:44%
 Screwed up my back.

00:01:31.457 --> 00:01:32.258 size:84% position:42%
  - No way.

00:01:32.291 --> 00:01:33.359
 Desktops, or?

00:01:33.392 --> 00:01:34.293
- Yeah.

00:01:34.326 --> 00:01:35.495
Big boxes, about like that big.

00:01:35.528 --> 00:01:36.729
 - Oh.

00:01:36.762 --> 00:01:39.232
 - That instantly just
 screwed up my dream

00:01:39.265 --> 00:01:42.502 align:start position:0%
  career ideas, and, so just
  everything is stressing

00:01:42.535 --> 00:01:43.669 size:88% position:44%
 me out now.

00:01:43.702 --> 00:01:44.904 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - So the stuff you're
 doing right now,

00:01:44.937 --> 00:01:45.671 size:88% position:44%
 the metal with the
 bat and everything,

00:01:45.704 --> 00:01:46.873 size:84% position:42%
  I get it.

00:01:46.906 --> 00:01:48.274 align:start size:88% position:13%
You know, but it's just
kind of old school.

00:01:48.307 --> 00:01:49.108
- Yeah.

00:01:49.141 --> 00:01:50.376
- You know, it's Roman.

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:52.612 size:88% position:44%
 It's very used car
 dealership violent.

00:01:52.645 --> 00:01:55.848 size:88% position:44%
  Those ideas are,
  I made this chart.

00:01:55.881 --> 00:01:56.682
- Wrong.

00:01:56.715 --> 00:01:57.917
- Wrong.

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.419 align:start size:88% position:13%
 And it said wrong
 until I accidentally--

00:02:00.452 --> 00:02:01.254
 - Scribbled 'em out?

00:02:01.287 --> 00:02:02.288
 - Scribbled 'em out.

00:02:02.321 --> 00:02:03.556
Yes, thank you.

00:02:03.589 --> 00:02:05.925 align:start size:88% position:13%
 But sometimes when
 you have wrong ideas,

00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:09.095 size:88% position:44%
  you gotta fold up
  those wrong ideas,

00:02:09.128 --> 00:02:11.397 align:start position:0%
  and when you make
  wrongigami and you fold up

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.566
those wrong ideas, what
do you get left with?

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:14.400
 - Ron?

00:02:14.433 --> 00:02:15.234
- R-O-N.

00:02:15.267 --> 00:02:16.068
 Ron.

00:02:16.101 --> 00:02:16.903
 - Ron.

00:02:16.936 --> 00:02:18.070 size:88% position:44%
  - An adult's name.

00:02:18.103 --> 00:02:19.572 align:start size:88% position:13%
 I'm gonna introduce
 you right now

00:02:19.605 --> 00:02:21.574 align:start position:0%
  to a man named Ron, the
  most stress free guy ever.

00:02:21.607 --> 00:02:22.575 align:start position:0%
  - Alright.
  - And he's gonna help us.

00:02:22.608 --> 00:02:23.409 size:88% position:44%
 You get it?

00:02:23.442 --> 00:02:24.243
 - [Josh] Yeah.

00:02:24.276 --> 00:02:25.478
 Sounds good.

00:02:25.511 --> 00:02:26.279
- Alright, thanks for
being here today, Josh.

00:02:26.312 --> 00:02:26.812
- Thanks for having me.

00:02:26.845 --> 00:02:28.047
- Yeah.

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.649 size:88% position:44%
 Ron is the chillest
 dude that I know.

00:02:29.682 --> 00:02:30.583
 - Ah.

00:02:30.616 --> 00:02:31.884 size:88% position:44%
 Namaste, gentlemen.

00:02:31.917 --> 00:02:33.819
 - Honestly, if I had
 to just curl up inside

00:02:33.852 --> 00:02:35.388 size:84% position:42%
  of a dude and take a nap,

00:02:35.421 --> 00:02:36.956 size:88% position:44%
 it would be in Ron.

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:37.957
- Josh.

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.791
- Pleasure to meet you.

00:02:38.824 --> 00:02:40.026
- Pleasure to meet you.

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:42.695
- He's just a smooth,
silky, dark, polyester,

00:02:42.728 --> 00:02:44.764 size:84% position:42%
  chocolate throat
  lozenge of a man.

00:02:46.165 --> 00:02:47.266
 No shades, eh?

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:48.701
- Yeah.

00:02:48.734 --> 00:02:50.703
- [Theo] You got nice
eyes, too, I feel like.

00:02:50.736 --> 00:02:51.537 size:88% position:44%
  I'm just guessing.

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:52.371 size:84% position:42%
  - Don't hide 'em.

00:02:52.404 --> 00:02:53.539
Don't hide 'em.

00:02:53.572 --> 00:02:55.642 align:start size:88% position:13%
 Let us see the windows
 into your soul.

00:02:57.142 --> 00:02:58.611
 - See, I told you he's calm.

00:02:58.644 --> 00:03:00.379
 - He is calm.

00:03:00.412 --> 00:03:03.983 align:start position:0%
 - For me, a part of relaxing
 is learning to let go.

00:03:04.016 --> 00:03:07.253
 Learning to deal with
 loss and learning to

00:03:07.286 --> 00:03:10.957 align:start position:0%
 give up expectations, but
 never give up hope, you know?

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:12.191
- Yeah.

00:03:12.224 --> 00:03:13.125 size:88% position:44%
  - There's always
  needs to be found.

00:03:13.158 --> 00:03:15.528
- 'Cause he struggles, this man.

00:03:15.561 --> 00:03:16.429
 - Oh, I can see it, I
 could feel the energy

00:03:16.462 --> 00:03:17.697
as soon as he walked in.

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.165 size:88% position:44%
 It changed.

00:03:19.198 --> 00:03:21.234 align:start size:88% position:13%
 My plants starting
 leaning away from him.

00:03:23.102 --> 00:03:24.470
 - [Theo] You're not
 a bad person, though.

00:03:24.503 --> 00:03:25.304
 - No.

00:03:25.337 --> 00:03:26.706
 You got a good spirit.

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:28.708
It's with you, I see it.

00:03:28.741 --> 00:03:30.509
You just got hurt a little bit.

00:03:30.542 --> 00:03:31.777
- Yeah.

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:32.612
 - And it's tough for
 you to let that go.

00:03:32.645 --> 00:03:33.813 size:88% position:44%
  I understand that.

00:03:33.846 --> 00:03:35.047 align:start size:88% position:13%
 I couldn't imagine
 what it would be like

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.515
 if all of a sudden
 they were just like,

00:03:36.548 --> 00:03:38.918
 "Hey, you just can't
 do comedy anymore."

00:03:38.951 --> 00:03:40.920 size:88% position:44%
 So I understand it
 and I appreciate it

00:03:40.953 --> 00:03:42.521 align:start size:88% position:13%
 and we're gonna
 get you through it.

00:03:42.554 --> 00:03:44.724
 Let's just meditate a
 little bit right now.

00:03:49.128 --> 00:03:51.297 size:84% position:42%
  (humming)

00:03:54.667 --> 00:03:55.668 size:88% position:44%
 - Yeah, maybe we'll
 go around the room

00:03:55.701 --> 00:03:56.936 size:88% position:44%
 and each release something.

00:03:56.969 --> 00:03:58.204
- Sounds great.

00:03:58.237 --> 00:03:59.939 size:84% position:42%
  (humming)

00:03:59.972 --> 00:04:00.940
 Reflectionism.

00:04:03.175 --> 00:04:06.879
- Being on a first name
basis with different

00:04:06.912 --> 00:04:08.114
insects in my apartment.

00:04:09.581 --> 00:04:10.617
 - LA traffic.

00:04:12.518 --> 00:04:15.354 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - Having to buy a
 gift for my assistant

00:04:15.387 --> 00:04:18.824 align:start position:0%
  that normally purchases
  the gifts that I give out.

00:04:18.857 --> 00:04:19.692 size:88% position:44%
  It's like,

00:04:20.626 --> 00:04:22.262
who picks out your gift?

00:04:24.963 --> 00:04:27.733 size:88% position:44%
 - Yeah, part of me kind of,

00:04:27.766 --> 00:04:31.337 size:88% position:44%
  wants to fuck with
  you guys a little.

00:04:33.072 --> 00:04:33.906
- Okay.

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:36.242 size:84% position:42%
  Okay, I think we're done.

00:04:37.476 --> 00:04:38.944
 - That's a real one
 I can resonate with.

00:04:38.977 --> 00:04:39.879 size:88% position:44%
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:04:39.912 --> 00:04:41.147
 Let's just remember that one.

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:42.848 size:88% position:44%
 I can tell you're
 just in a deep need

00:04:42.881 --> 00:04:45.851 align:start size:88% position:13%
of relaxation and
luckily for you, I mean,

00:04:45.884 --> 00:04:47.320
 we're in an era where
 there's just so many

00:04:47.353 --> 00:04:48.654
different ways to relax.

00:04:48.687 --> 00:04:49.955 align:start size:88% position:13%
  There's so many
  different options,

00:04:49.988 --> 00:04:51.657
 especially here in LA.

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:52.858 align:start size:88% position:13%
  You got so many
  things you can do.

00:04:52.891 --> 00:04:54.493
 You can hike.

00:04:54.526 --> 00:04:55.761 size:84% position:42%
  You can meditate.

00:04:55.794 --> 00:04:56.729
 Yoga.

00:04:56.762 --> 00:04:59.065
 There's all types of exercise.

00:04:59.098 --> 00:05:01.034
And if that doesn't work for ya,

00:05:03.135 --> 00:05:04.036
 there's always weed.

00:05:04.069 --> 00:05:05.971 size:88% position:44%
  - Weed is a great relaxer.

00:05:06.004 --> 00:05:09.408 align:start position:0%
  Even when Bob Marley, they
  told him he had cancer,

00:05:09.441 --> 00:05:11.311 align:start size:88% position:13%
 he just said,
 "Whatever," and died.

00:05:13.645 --> 00:05:15.614 size:84% position:42%
  - Sure, there are a lot
  of problems in the world.

00:05:15.647 --> 00:05:16.849
A lot of famine.

00:05:16.882 --> 00:05:18.284
A lot of murder.

00:05:18.317 --> 00:05:21.020 align:start position:0%
  But it's also, like,
  there's cartoons and shit,

00:05:21.053 --> 00:05:23.022
 and we could be watchin' them.

00:05:23.055 --> 00:05:24.256
 - That's a good point.

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:25.458 size:88% position:44%
 It's crazy to think
 how many cartoons

00:05:25.491 --> 00:05:26.859 align:start size:88% position:13%
 are out there and that
 we're not watching

00:05:26.892 --> 00:05:27.827 size:88% position:44%
  them at all times.

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:29.028
 - Mhm.

00:05:29.061 --> 00:05:31.731
Or, I'm a firm believer, if, uh,

00:05:31.764 --> 00:05:34.900 align:start position:0%
  every TV that has the
  news on like at an airport

00:05:34.933 --> 00:05:36.535 size:88% position:44%
  or something, if
  you just turned it

00:05:36.568 --> 00:05:40.106 size:88% position:44%
 and then put it on like the
 Muppet Babies or something,

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:41.707
the whole world would
be a lot less stressed.

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:42.875
 - [Theo] 100%.

00:05:42.908 --> 00:05:44.577 align:start size:88% position:13%
- We wouldn't know
what was going on, but,

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:45.478 size:88% position:44%
  who cares?

00:05:47.413 --> 00:05:48.981
 - Hm.

00:05:49.014 --> 00:05:51.484 align:start position:0%
  Yeah, the problem with
  Muppet Babies is it never,

00:05:54.119 --> 00:05:55.388 align:start size:88% position:13%
you don't know what
happened next, you know?

00:05:55.421 --> 00:05:56.889 size:88% position:44%
 - [Ron] Yeah, yeah.

00:05:56.922 --> 00:05:59.659
 - I just assumed that Muppet
 Babies became the Muppets.

00:06:00.726 --> 00:06:02.729 size:88% position:44%
  - Oh yeah.

00:06:03.762 --> 00:06:05.331
 Damn.

00:06:05.364 --> 00:06:07.800
 (soft music)

00:06:08.767 --> 00:06:10.303 size:88% position:44%
  I fuckin' love weed, dude.

00:06:13.272 --> 00:06:14.774 align:start position:0%
  - Well a lot of your
  issues stem from the fact

00:06:14.807 --> 00:06:17.042
 that you lost something that
 was very important to you,

00:06:17.075 --> 00:06:18.778 size:84% position:42%
  a dream of yours.

00:06:18.811 --> 00:06:20.312
 But, I'm here to tell
 you that you can have

00:06:20.345 --> 00:06:21.247 align:start size:88% position:13%
 all types of dreams
 and that's what

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:23.115 size:88% position:44%
  we're gonna work on today.

00:06:23.148 --> 00:06:25.050 size:88% position:44%
 We're gonna build a
 little dream board.

00:06:25.083 --> 00:06:26.352 size:88% position:44%
 Come up with some new goals

00:06:26.385 --> 00:06:28.521
 to help you refocus.

00:06:28.554 --> 00:06:29.388 size:88% position:44%
 You cool with that?

00:06:29.421 --> 00:06:30.423
- Yeah.

00:06:30.456 --> 00:06:32.858
 (upbeat music)

00:06:32.891 --> 00:06:33.960
 - Side boob.

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:36.796
 - Okay, well I want to
 encourage you to think

00:06:36.829 --> 00:06:38.964
 a little bit outside the boob.

00:06:38.997 --> 00:06:40.866
- I'll save this for home, okay?

00:06:40.899 --> 00:06:45.337 align:start position:0%
  - Now, when it comes to
  pickin' the right picture,

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:46.939 size:88% position:44%
 to go on your vision board,

00:06:46.972 --> 00:06:48.307 align:start size:88% position:13%
 you gotta make
 sure it's something

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:51.110
 that speaks to you directly.

00:06:51.143 --> 00:06:52.945 size:84% position:42%
  - [Theo] Look what I got.

00:06:52.978 --> 00:06:53.779 size:84% position:42%
  - [Josh] Poodles.

00:06:53.812 --> 00:06:55.581
- Twin poodles.

00:06:55.614 --> 00:06:58.150 align:start position:0%
 - I got me a cruise ship
 'cause I wanna go on a cruise.

00:06:58.183 --> 00:06:59.318
- Okay.

00:06:59.351 --> 00:07:01.921 align:start size:88% position:13%
 We're leaving a
 little stress already.

00:07:01.954 --> 00:07:03.122
 - [Theo] Ooh.

00:07:03.155 --> 00:07:05.291 align:start size:88% position:13%
 A Bulgari emerald
 and diamond necklace.

00:07:05.324 --> 00:07:06.992 size:84% position:42%
  - Ooh, that would
  look good on you.

00:07:07.025 --> 00:07:08.127 size:84% position:42%
  - Thanks.

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:09.728 align:start size:88% position:13%
- It's fun to do
crafts together as men.

00:07:09.761 --> 00:07:10.963
 - Yeah people forget
 how much fun this

00:07:10.996 --> 00:07:12.131
 kind of stuff is, man.

00:07:12.164 --> 00:07:15.001 size:88% position:44%
  Lowkey, yolked out fellas.

00:07:16.034 --> 00:07:17.269
- And they don't get it.

00:07:17.302 --> 00:07:18.771
 They're like, "Oh what
 are you guys up doing?

00:07:18.804 --> 00:07:20.940 align:start size:88% position:13%
"You're out at the club,
you're out drinking,

00:07:20.973 --> 00:07:22.475
"you're out at the race track."

00:07:22.508 --> 00:07:26.345 align:start position:0%
 It's like, no, I'm out making
 dreams with my friends.

00:07:26.378 --> 00:07:27.580
 Coming up with goals.

00:07:27.613 --> 00:07:28.948
That's what we're about.

00:07:28.981 --> 00:07:29.915
- How do you feel Josh?

00:07:29.948 --> 00:07:30.749
- Less stressed.

00:07:30.782 --> 00:07:31.817
 This helped.

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:33.052
- Yeah.

00:07:33.085 --> 00:07:34.520
 Envisioning stuff is
 fun, man, but I think

00:07:34.553 --> 00:07:36.322 align:start position:0%
  maybe we light into a
  couple of massages, bruh.

00:07:38.223 --> 00:07:39.425 align:start size:88% position:13%
 Like some true
 gentlemen, you know.

00:07:39.458 --> 00:07:40.759 size:84% position:42%
  Like some adults.

00:07:40.792 --> 00:07:42.094
You know, nothing crazy.

00:07:42.127 --> 00:07:44.463
 Like make your own
 pizza kind of thing?

00:07:44.496 --> 00:07:45.764 size:88% position:44%
 You had 'em before?

00:07:45.797 --> 00:07:46.699 size:88% position:44%
  - Uh yeah.

00:07:46.732 --> 00:07:48.167 size:84% position:42%
  - And who was the person?

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:49.235 align:start position:0%
 Do you remember who they
 were, what they looked like?

00:07:49.268 --> 00:07:50.169
 - Uh.

00:07:50.202 --> 00:07:52.071 size:88% position:44%
 I think their name was Tim.

00:07:52.104 --> 00:07:54.173 size:88% position:44%
  (laughing)

00:07:54.206 --> 00:07:55.808
- He sounds like a good person.

00:07:55.841 --> 00:07:58.110 align:start position:0%
  - Yeah, you gotta
  remember, if a man touches

00:07:58.143 --> 00:08:01.647 align:start position:0%
your body like that, it's
helpful to remember their name.

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:02.715
They prefer it.

00:08:02.748 --> 00:08:03.549
 - [Theo] Yeah.

00:08:03.582 --> 00:08:05.117 size:88% position:44%
 - Probably.

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:07.219
 - Yeah, I remember the
 man that touched me.

00:08:07.252 --> 00:08:08.087
 Dale.

00:08:10.489 --> 00:08:11.524 size:84% position:42%
  - [Ron] That's beautiful.

00:08:18.697 --> 00:08:19.865
 - So let's get this--

00:08:19.898 --> 00:08:21.066 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - [Ron] Are you still
 thinking about it?

00:08:21.099 --> 00:08:22.601
- I don't know what I'm
thinking about, man.

00:08:22.634 --> 00:08:24.837 size:88% position:44%
  (laughing)

00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:27.306 align:start position:0%
 I wish I had a vision
 board in my head right now.

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:29.275
 Yeah, we should get one man.

00:08:29.308 --> 00:08:30.676
We should get a massage.

00:08:32.678 --> 00:08:33.879
Massage?

00:08:33.912 --> 00:08:34.747 size:88% position:44%
  - Massage.

00:08:35.747 --> 00:08:36.582
 - Mhm.

00:08:37.983 --> 00:08:40.586 align:start position:0%
  - Man, you got a lot
  more body than I thought.

00:08:42.588 --> 00:08:45.524

00:08:45.557 --> 00:08:46.892

  with other people.

00:11:17.843 --> 00:11:19.011
 - It's true.

00:11:19.044 --> 00:11:20.479 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - You know, and a lot
 of things you were

00:11:20.512 --> 00:11:21.246
talking about before, it didn't
really include those things,

00:11:21.279 --> 00:11:22.081 size:84% position:42%
  you know?

00:11:22.114 --> 00:11:23.348
- Yeah.

00:11:23.381 --> 00:11:24.616
 - I mean, traffic's a
 sedentary environment.

00:11:24.649 --> 00:11:25.851 size:84% position:42%
  You know, beating
  metal with a bat.

00:11:25.884 --> 00:11:27.687 align:start size:88% position:13%
 That's something
 you do by yourself.

00:11:28.553 --> 00:11:29.655
 Masturbation.

00:11:29.688 --> 00:11:31.156 align:start size:88% position:13%
 That's usually
 something you do alone

00:11:31.189 --> 00:11:33.792 size:88% position:44%
 unless you're a part of a
 club or synchronized group.

00:11:33.825 --> 00:11:35.060
It's funny man.

00:11:35.093 --> 00:11:35.994 size:88% position:44%
  Something when you
  get out and about

00:11:36.027 --> 00:11:37.463
and get going with other people,

00:11:37.496 --> 00:11:39.264 align:start position:0%
 you know, if we quit listening
 to the voice in our heads,

00:11:39.297 --> 00:11:40.833
 sometimes that voice
 can be so stressed out

00:11:40.866 --> 00:11:42.935 size:88% position:44%
  and we just listen
  to somebody else.

00:11:42.968 --> 00:11:47.239 align:start position:0%
 That calm, passive, beautiful
 dark dolphin himself.

00:11:49.241 --> 00:11:50.609 size:88% position:44%
  Only one thing left to do.

00:11:51.643 --> 00:11:52.445
 - What's that?

00:11:54.579 --> 00:11:57.583 align:start position:0%
 - [Theo] I feel like I'm
 just pettin' a bubble bath.

00:11:57.616 --> 00:12:01.053
 - [Ron] Ooh you strong
 but gentle, I like it.

00:12:01.086 --> 00:12:11.130
 Oh yeah boy.

00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:21.140
 Oh yeah boy.

00:12:59.644 --> 00:13:02.548
Ooh, I had a dream that
started just like this.

00:13:02.581 --> 00:13:03.415
 Yeah.

00:13:05.050 --> 00:13:07.452
- Today was a lesson in
that you have to open up

00:13:07.485 --> 00:13:08.687
 to let the stress out.

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:10.622
 So how are you gonna open up?

00:13:10.655 --> 00:13:12.391 size:88% position:44%
  Well, you can dream board.

00:13:12.424 --> 00:13:15.394 align:start position:0%
  You can go look for
  treasure with your cousin.

00:13:15.427 --> 00:13:16.762
 You can swim.

00:13:16.795 --> 00:13:18.163 align:start size:88% position:13%
You could eat ice cream
with somebody from

00:13:18.196 --> 00:13:19.765
another country.

00:13:19.798 --> 00:13:21.333 size:88% position:44%
 A lot of different options.

00:13:21.366 --> 00:13:22.634
 But try one.

00:13:22.667 --> 00:13:25.003 align:start size:88% position:13%
 Josh did, and look
 what happened to him.

00:13:25.036 --> 00:13:26.438 size:88% position:44%
  He had a good day.

00:13:26.471 --> 00:13:28.574 size:88% position:44%
 Your comfort zone
 can be your coffin.

00:13:29.674 --> 00:13:30.743
I'm Theo Vaughn.

00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:32.845
