00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.790
Here we want a summary of the friend rate. So,

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.250
we can use the with command and subset the data

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.840
so we only consider users with tenure of at least

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:11.410
one day. Now we just want a summary of friend count

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:14.310
divided by tenure, which gives us the friends per day

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:17.350
since the user's been active. When we run the code,

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:20.271
we see that the median rate is about 0.22, and

00:00:20.271 --> 00:00:24.850
the maximum rate is 417. Now, this is definitely an outlier,

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:29.015
considering our data, since the third quartile is only about 0.5.
