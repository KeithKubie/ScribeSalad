me[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.150
- Thank you very much
for joining us tonight.

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:09.830
I really want to thank Meredith
for always doing and making

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:12.790
this really nice,
elaborate introduction that

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:15.920
are at the same time humbling
but extremely flattering.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.250
So I really, really appreciate.

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:21.760
So tonight, I'm going to speak
about a topic that's actually

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.860
quite new to me, but I
thought it was a lot more

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:26.720
relevant to humanity.

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.020
Population is how
we can or we may

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.290
or we may not be able to
actually predict earthquakes.

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.800
And if you fly to the San
Andreas or San Francisco

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.480
and you have your
laptop open and you

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.324
show seismogram
everybody will ask you,

00:00:40.324 --> 00:00:41.740
can you really
predict earthquake?

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:43.760
When is the next big one?

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.030
And every time we tend to, we
have to say carefully that we

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.020
probably cannot
predict earthquake,

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:55.390
because we can have liability
issues in saying wrong things.

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.090
But I'm actually
not losing hope.

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.990
Recently, we've harnessed
so much data and we're

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:04.900
making more observations
that I'm actually--

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.750
I think that one day
we'll be able to do so,

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.420
but I wanted to go
with you and show you

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.610
what are the
timescales involved in

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:14.980
and where it actually matters.

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.980
And so, this is a
quite old photo.

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:21.910
It's taken after
the 1906 earthquake.

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:25.160
It's a fault that runs through
the city of San Francisco.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.040
So that image that you
see here, of course,

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.850
it's older constructions,
it was very dramatic.

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.490
Most of it was due
to the fire that

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:35.210
started after the earthquake.

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.960
So earthquakes do generate
a lot more hazards that

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.770
are just coming out after that.

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:42.700
The other type of--

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.770
When we think about
earthquakes, we

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:46.520
think about this previous photo.

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.990
And what we see here
it's mostly damage

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.090
that is sudden right
after the earthquake.

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.910
It's people dying,
it's building collapse,

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:57.330
it's highway collapse
as you mentioned.

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.499
And these are iconic figures
of what earthquakes are.

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:02.915
What I also want
to point out it's

00:02:02.915 --> 00:02:05.955
not necessarily the
casualties that we refer to,

00:02:05.955 --> 00:02:08.830
but it's also the
great economic loss

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.220
that are a component
with these earthquakes.

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.890
Some countries have really
a lot of trouble recovering

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:21.190
from those, such as Haiti in
2010, Japan in 1994 and in 2011

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.410
was hit twice badly.

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.020
So there's a lot of economic
loss due to these earthquakes.

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.390
Earthquakes are also
the way that the earth

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.790
has to form landscapes.

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.540
This is a photo from 2010,
another big earthquake

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.260
in Southern California.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.200
And you can see
here very nice fault

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.610
scar that's not been eroded
yet and a geologist for scale.

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:45.829
And if you can see
the hills behind,

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:47.870
you actually start
understanding that earthquakes

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:53.180
are the cause of the building
of the landscape around us.

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.070
And I want to zoom out
and look at the Earth.

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:59.520
And I can tell you
most of the topography

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.180
that we see here is
due to earthquakes.

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.220
So what you can see here is the
[INAUDIBLE] image topography

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:07.180
map.

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.470
We are looking over there,
centering around the Pacific

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:16.870
ring, because we have a nice
distribution of seismicity

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:17.700
around it.

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.970
But you can see there's a
lot of texture in this photo.

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.760
It is just showing you that
the earth is very dynamic,

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.390
and actually the earthquakes
are a system, a mechanism

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:29.890
to deal with this.

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:34.390
So the plate tectonics is
basically all of these.

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.720
They're not totally rigid,
but we can simplify the system

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.230
as a very rigid plate.

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:41.280
They are surrounded
by those zones,

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.690
that you can see the
topography quite clear.

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.090
You can see the
zones here and here.

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:49.750
The topography shows you that
this is the Pacific plate.

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:54.260
It's surrounded, it's
bordered by active faults,

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.660
and the San Andreas
fault being one of them.

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.320
So if you look at the Earth
at this scale you say,

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:00.700
these are lines.

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.206
People like to see fault lines.

00:04:02.206 --> 00:04:02.830
It's not lines.

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:04.890
It's the surface, it's a volume.

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:06.910
But we can simplify
them as line,

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:11.340
and then we can assume that
maybe earthquakes are on it.

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.850
Earthquakes are indeed mostly
located on these lines here.

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:18.930
So these are ridges, this is
the San Andreas fault system,

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:20.064
this is Japan.

00:04:20.064 --> 00:04:21.480
And you can see
that globally, you

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:26.130
may have distributed seismicity,
but all those stars are

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:28.890
representing where most of
the big earthquakes are.

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:34.110
So crudely speaking, you know
that at boundaries of plates

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:35.520
you may have earthquakes.

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.890
Of course Oklahoma
is showing up here,

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:40.350
not quite but the [INAUDIBLE]
that you can have seismicity.

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:42.072
But on to the
first order, if you

00:04:42.072 --> 00:04:43.530
want to know where
earthquakes are,

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:46.100
it's usually on those
plate's boundaries.

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:49.210
Now if you zoom in
to this boundary,

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:51.510
it's actually a
more diffuse system.

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:53.490
These red lines
and the black ones

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:56.790
are representing maps faults.

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:58.390
And you can see
it's not in line,

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:59.640
it's not necessarily straight.

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:04.470
It has curvature, it
has nice delineation.

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.420
The dots here are
showing the seismicity

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:08.940
that we have that actually
seems to correspond

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:11.510
to those topography features.

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:14.160
So if we want to know
where faults are,

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.340
traditionally what we look
at is the past seismicity

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:20.630
in these catalogs and look
at where seismicity is.

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:24.320
So this is San Francisco
and the biggest earthquake

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:27.330
was along this fault. And
you can see for most of it,

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.190
there's actually no
seismicity at all.

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:33.330
So if you rely on these catalogs
to know earthquakes are and try

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:36.120
to predict it, you are actually
missing out a huge part,

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.140
because here you can
have a large earthquake,

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:42.060
but you have any seismicity
to understand it.

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:44.730
So I spent my PhD, you
know, somewhere over there

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:50.430
and had zero earthquake for 5
and 1/2 years, which is good.

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:53.670
But sitting there
it was interesting.

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:56.720
Faults can be very quiet.

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:59.540
So to deal with
this, geologists,

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:02.930
they dig big trenches
through faults

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:06.500
and they look at the
texture and the composition

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.410
of the minerals in rocks.

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:11.660
And they try to date
those rocks and then

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:14.120
to try to find the
history of the faults

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:15.830
and how many
earthquakes there were.

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:19.520
So this is an example on
the Wasatch fault in Utah,

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:24.109
which borders the Salt
Lake City to the east.

00:06:24.109 --> 00:06:25.900
And so, if you actually
look at those rocks

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:27.700
and you make time
history of them,

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:29.590
you can find when
earthquakes happen.

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:33.550
And I'm showing you the best
example we have of this.

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:36.476
So this is New Zealand.

00:06:36.476 --> 00:06:37.850
And I don't know
if you can tell,

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:40.090
but there's some
linear feature here.

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:42.290
Linear features are not natural.

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:44.830
They're really caused by faults.

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:48.910
And this is highlighted here
what we call the Alpine fault.

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:51.250
From a French perspective
it was like, these

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:52.180
aren't all the Alps.

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:52.750
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:54.670
- [SPEAKING FRENCH] .

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:57.430
But New Zealand is like it.

00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:00.910
They also make excellent cheese,
so they have a good excuse.

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:02.410
But so basically,
this is the Alpine

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:05.610
fault. It's a quite fast
fault. It's also heavily--

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:07.930
There's nice topography to it.

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:10.960
And if we trench
through it, geologists

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:13.869
have found a nice
series of earthquakes.

00:07:13.869 --> 00:07:15.910
It's also nice because
it's not really populated,

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:18.280
so it does not cause
tremendous damage,

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:21.530
so we can use the word nice
to think about earthquakes.

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:24.040
This is the dates of
those earthquakes,

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:25.780
in thousands of years.

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:27.820
And you can see this
nice regular line

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:29.920
here with [INAUDIBLE]
distribution

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:33.290
[INAUDIBLE] uncertainty of
when these earthquakes happen.

00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:36.100
So if you look at the
interval between each of them,

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:38.980
you make those plots here,
which look at the recurrence

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:43.710
interval between earthquakes,
and you see that they're mostly

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:45.870
around 300 years.

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:48.840
And for all of these 10
to 20 year earthquakes,

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:52.450
every 300 years you
may have an earthquake.

00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:57.270
And so the last one
being in the 1700s,

00:07:57.270 --> 00:08:00.120
we're close to the end of the
cycle for this earthquake.

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:04.710
We think about earthquake cycles
here because every 300 years,

00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:06.250
we can have an earthquake.

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:09.085
So bingo, we should be able
to predict earthquakes.

00:08:09.085 --> 00:08:10.710
Of course, I'm not
giving you this talk

00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:12.630
to say yes, we solved that.

00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:15.360
Many faults do not
behave like this.

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:18.930
This is a time series here
showing the lifelong time

00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:20.790
series of the faults.

00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:24.330
These [INAUDIBLE] are showing
you when earthquakes happen.

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:26.160
These are several faults.

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:29.220
This is the Alpine fault, you
see that beautiful time series

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:31.890
of periodic earthquakes.

00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:33.690
And then you look at
the San Andreas fault

00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:36.960
and the system is actually
[INAUDIBLE] not regular.

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:40.470
It has these weird
clusters of seismicity.

00:08:40.470 --> 00:08:44.435
The Dead Sea Transform fault has
somewhat of a regular interval,

00:08:44.435 --> 00:08:45.060
but not at all.

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:48.510
And the Dead Sea,
this one is actually

00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:50.550
showing clusters of events.

00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:54.180
So the predictability
here is not strong,

00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:56.520
because we have
clustering of events

00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:59.960
and we can't even
control those clusters.

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:03.390
So what happened on a fault?

00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:06.150
We think about
earthquake cycles,

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:08.720
because an earthquake
happens, it heals,

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:10.770
it's in between
cycles and hit again

00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:12.750
and it's supposed
to be periodic.

00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:15.060
Scientists today do not
really like the word cycle

00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:20.630
because of this irregularity
in some of the fault systems.

00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:23.220
But I'd like to just
emphasize that it's just

00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:25.860
a very, if we think about
it, a very simple model.

00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:27.360
You can think about
this model where

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:30.600
you have a spring in a handle.

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:34.360
You have a sure phase that could
be rough or smooth as you wish.

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:37.100
And then you have a
block, and you pull it.

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:40.770
So that if you have elasticity
in your string here,

00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:42.480
the block is not
going to move as you

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:47.430
pull until it's too
tensed, and then the block

00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:49.680
will slide it toward you.

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:52.020
And so this effect of
increasing the stress

00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:55.260
loading on the
string, and then slip,

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:58.800
and it sticks, and it slips,
and so on and so forth,

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:03.056
is the fundamental view
of earthquake cycle,

00:10:03.056 --> 00:10:04.680
where you increase
the force the plates

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:09.320
are moving at a somewhat regular
pace and then it's locked.

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:11.320
It sticks, and then
[INAUDIBLE] to an earthquake

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:12.850
and so on and so forth.

00:10:12.850 --> 00:10:15.450
So if we model
forces in the earth,

00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:18.570
you can say it's a constant
forcing, constant slip

00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:22.510
constant forcing, constant
slip, this is the ideal case.

00:10:22.510 --> 00:10:24.370
We have in the United
States one fault

00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:28.230
that seem to behave like this.

00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:31.410
It's in San Andreas fault
in the Parkfield area

00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:33.510
and it was so
regular in the past.

00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:36.630
These are years of occurrence
of these earthquakes.

00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:39.861
Every 20 plus years there
was a little magnitude 6

00:10:39.861 --> 00:10:42.360
that would occur on this fault.
So these are the earthquakes

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:46.680
series and you can look at
number of earthquakes and time.

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:48.660
You draw a line and
you predict when

00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:50.820
the next earthquake will go.

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:54.940
So the prediction was that
between 1987 and 1983,

00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:56.590
we should have an earthquake.

00:10:56.590 --> 00:10:58.800
So the USGS deployed
a lot of resources

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:01.290
around Parkfield to
instrument the fault

00:11:01.290 --> 00:11:04.740
and to capture the full cycle.

00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:06.547
But the earthquake
did not happen.

00:11:06.547 --> 00:11:08.130
And I think a lot
of the seismologists

00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:11.370
completely lost faith
because it took many more

00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:14.530
years for the earthquake
to actually occur.

00:11:14.530 --> 00:11:19.800
And so I think when big events
like this, either like Tohoku

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:22.440
or all these events where we
don't expect them to happen,

00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:25.920
it's very hard for
seismologists to react.

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:29.340
And so I think because of
that, a lot of the seismology

00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:31.920
has been going away
from prediction.

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:35.250
It was all about prediction
before, this has failed,

00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:38.700
let's move on and not
predict earthquake any more.

00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:40.620
So let's think about
this time theory

00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:42.210
that I was just drawing you.

00:11:42.210 --> 00:11:45.330
We have the earthquake
at time zero,

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:48.600
we have what happens before
or in between earthquakes,

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:50.980
and then we have
what happens after.

00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:53.780
So here, I'm showing you
that between years to months

00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:55.860
to second before
the earthquake, this

00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:58.890
is the phase that we
call a nucleation phase.

00:11:58.890 --> 00:12:01.290
We are at the end of
the earthquake cycle,

00:12:01.290 --> 00:12:04.770
something is happening, we
will have an earthquake.

00:12:04.770 --> 00:12:08.040
We just don't know when t=0 is.

00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:11.299
What happens after is
the earthquake ruptures.

00:12:11.299 --> 00:12:12.840
It's not and
[SNAPS FINGERS] instant.

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:15.550
It's not a snap like
this, it takes some time.

00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:19.147
So we have a few seconds to
tens of seconds, during which

00:12:19.147 --> 00:12:21.480
and after which all the
shaking, the ground motion goes,

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:23.920
and that's what
destroys the building.

00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:27.420
So the prediction of
earthquakes within years,

00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:30.910
I'm a little bit
skeptical today.

00:12:30.910 --> 00:12:32.580
And I would say that
probably we may not

00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:35.640
be able to do that
anytime soon, mostly

00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:39.120
because we do have many
years in our records.

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:42.120
But let's look at nucleation.

00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:45.480
What happens between months and
seconds before the earthquake?

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:48.860
Unfortunately, all of
these precautionary phases

00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:53.010
are seen or detected
after the earthquake.

00:12:53.010 --> 00:12:55.350
So far, we have
seen those phases,

00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:59.050
but it's always after going
back to looking at the data.

00:12:59.050 --> 00:13:05.470
So in 2011, March 29, 2011,
magnitude 9.0 in Japan.

00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:07.090
This is a map of Japan.

00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:11.880
This plot is showing you with
colors the amount of slip

00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:14.360
on a fault surface.

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:16.080
It's dipping like this.

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:17.940
And the contours are
showing you where

00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:20.694
the slip during the
Tohoku event happened.

00:13:20.694 --> 00:13:22.110
So basically in
the middle, that's

00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:25.050
where you had about
15 meters of slip

00:13:25.050 --> 00:13:26.740
and then nothing in between.

00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:28.140
And these colors
are showing what

00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:30.540
happened before the earthquake.

00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:33.680
And so using data
on shore, scientists

00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:37.970
have been able to look at how
much slip, very slow slip,

00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:41.570
happened years before
the earthquake.

00:13:41.570 --> 00:13:44.090
This line here,
this time series,

00:13:44.090 --> 00:13:49.130
is showing you what a GPS would
record as a function of years.

00:13:49.130 --> 00:13:51.500
So you can see we
don't have that many,

00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:54.640
we have maybe a few
decades worth of data,

00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:56.190
but not that much more.

00:13:56.190 --> 00:13:57.920
And if you remove
some of the effects,

00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:01.400
you can see that there is this
non-constant but accelerating

00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:06.020
phase of displacement, and
this is mapped into the fault.

00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:08.120
And so we have this
acceleration of slip,

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:12.860
it's very slow and
steady, but it grows.

00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:15.770
And we can detect it by
looking at years of data.

00:14:15.770 --> 00:14:21.110
It's very often afterwards
that we notice this.

00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:23.810
If you look at the foreshocks.

00:14:23.810 --> 00:14:27.710
Foreshocks are earthquakes that
happened before the earthquake,

00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:29.030
the main shock.

00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:31.130
Foreshocks are only
called foreshocks

00:14:31.130 --> 00:14:34.400
after the main shock,
so it's hard to use them

00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:36.564
as a prediction.

00:14:36.564 --> 00:14:38.480
What I'm showing you
here is three earthquakes

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:41.280
that happened in
Southern California.

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:44.370
This is the El Mayor-Cucapah
earthquake in 2010.

00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:47.630
I have sensors actually nearby.

00:14:47.630 --> 00:14:50.390
And my husband actually
was on a Jeep on the road

00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:54.140
with GPS deploying
sensors at the same time.

00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:56.300
These are two
earthquakes in the 90s

00:14:56.300 --> 00:15:00.060
that happened on the eastern
shore zone in California.

00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:01.850
These are showing
you the magnitude

00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:04.130
with time of the earthquakes.

00:15:04.130 --> 00:15:07.820
The black ones are, you
see the aftershocks.

00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:10.160
because they happen
after the main shock,

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:11.720
shown with this cross.

00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:14.416
And the red ones
are the foreshocks.

00:15:14.416 --> 00:15:17.050
Do you see any pattern?

00:15:17.050 --> 00:15:17.550
No.

00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:19.080
There are some
earthquakes, but are they

00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:21.360
foreshocks, aftershocks of
the previous earthquakes?

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:22.690
We don't know.

00:15:22.690 --> 00:15:24.390
So these are kind
of the observations.

00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:27.660
In the lab though, if you were
to make earthquakes in the lab,

00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:30.210
the system is a lot
more predictable.

00:15:30.210 --> 00:15:34.810
And so these lab quakes,
they win every time.

00:15:34.810 --> 00:15:36.010
I'll show you at the end.

00:15:36.010 --> 00:15:37.900
We have a nice plot on this.

00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:40.960
These lab quakes
behave so nicely.

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:44.530
They behave like the model,
not like the Earth, apparently.

00:15:44.530 --> 00:15:48.530
But these lab quakes are showing
you the onset of seismicity.

00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:50.800
You can see those dots,
same kind of style

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:53.290
here, getting more
and more frequent

00:15:53.290 --> 00:15:55.624
as we go, right
before the earthquake.

00:15:55.624 --> 00:15:57.790
And this is just showing
you kind of an acceleration

00:15:57.790 --> 00:15:59.410
of the step on the earthquakes.

00:15:59.410 --> 00:16:02.410
So in the lab, they behave
like we want them to be.

00:16:02.410 --> 00:16:06.690
In nature, it's just
not, it's not there yet.

00:16:06.690 --> 00:16:11.400
And there are two debated models
for how earthquakes start,

00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:15.420
and no one, I think, has clearly
stated this is the one model.

00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:18.120
I think it's probably, as
always, a combination of both.

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:18.840
.

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:21.600
These are the
cascade model, where

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:24.540
you have a bunch of
pops on the fault.

00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:26.130
They all pop and
trigger each other

00:16:26.130 --> 00:16:29.320
and then eventually becomes
a big one, in which case

00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:30.820
it's very hard to
say which one is

00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:32.860
going to trigger the last one.

00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:35.470
Or you can have
this one, which is

00:16:35.470 --> 00:16:39.820
kind of a slow growth, a seismic
slip which accelerates and then

00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:41.380
becomes a big one.

00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:44.300
And this is rarely observed.

00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:45.520
And like this one.

00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:48.940
But it's a lot more
consistent with models and lab

00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:50.200
experiments.

00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:52.780
And so there were many
papers this summer

00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:55.270
that discuss these two
models, and then we

00:16:55.270 --> 00:16:58.550
don't have the data resolution
to actually validate those two.

00:16:58.550 --> 00:17:00.620
But this is the grail of
earthquake prediction.

00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:05.210
If you could actually see those
eventually and classify them

00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:07.160
as precursor, then
maybe you would

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:10.760
be able to be before
the earthquake.

00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:13.780
So I would say that what
happened in nucleation,

00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:16.630
I think maybe we rarely
observe them, usually

00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:18.099
for large earthquakes.

00:17:18.099 --> 00:17:21.190
But we have observed some.

00:17:21.190 --> 00:17:23.140
So I think looking
back at the data,

00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:28.069
we may have hope to study
those phases a lot more.

00:17:28.069 --> 00:17:31.830
So now, the user, the
person, the surgeon,

00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:34.500
the eye surgeon with
his laser is saying,

00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:37.320
when should I stop the laser?

00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:40.330
When is the shaking coming
if there is an earthquake?

00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:42.390
And so, I'm not
skipping this phase,

00:17:42.390 --> 00:17:46.380
I'm just saying, who cares about
when the earthquake happened?

00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:49.920
I really care just about the
shaking and how much shaking.

00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:52.320
And this becomes
actually a different side

00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:56.940
of seismology, which is very
much oriented toward operation

00:17:56.940 --> 00:18:00.390
and user and, you know,
what matters for people

00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:02.940
is really just the amount of
shaking, whatever earthquake

00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:04.590
style we have.

00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:07.800
So, if these are your
science question,

00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:10.780
then we can look
at other things.

00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:14.940
So I want to focus the
rest of this discussion

00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:19.140
on what happened during the
rupture and right after,

00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:24.120
and how can we help the
early warning of the shaking.

00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:25.620
And this is--

00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:28.620
I'm an amateur at this, but
I wanted to show you briefly

00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:30.990
what the system of the
earthquake early warning

00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:32.120
is about.

00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:33.960
And I heard today
that the funding

00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:37.320
will be continued, which
is nice when you already

00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:40.680
spent 20 millions of
dollars, to have it finally

00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:43.360
an official earthquake early
warning system in the United

00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:44.890
States.

00:18:44.890 --> 00:18:47.950
Mexico has one since the 90s.

00:18:47.950 --> 00:18:49.990
So we're developing--

00:18:49.990 --> 00:18:53.840
Scientists are developing
one in California,

00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:55.730
and we'll see the
West Coast in general.

00:18:55.730 --> 00:18:58.270
And the system is as such.

00:18:58.270 --> 00:19:02.800
Phones and internet is
faster, propagates faster,

00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:04.510
than seismic waves.

00:19:04.510 --> 00:19:05.830
That's where you win.

00:19:05.830 --> 00:19:07.420
That's basically it.

00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:10.620
If you have an earthquake
that happens on a fault,

00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:11.910
some ways will propagate.

00:19:11.910 --> 00:19:13.860
The first one, the yellow one.

00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:15.810
The first one is not
the most damaging,

00:19:15.810 --> 00:19:18.100
but he carries a
lot of information.

00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:23.730
So what you want is having
sensors close by the epicenter.

00:19:23.730 --> 00:19:26.340
Then you have more to say well,
this is an earthquake and not

00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:29.580
a car driving by, so you may
need a few sensors for this.

00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:33.150
But then the information is no
longer sent with seismic waves,

00:19:33.150 --> 00:19:37.160
but with phones and
communication like this,

00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:41.520
so then the data gets into
the earthquake [INAUDIBLE],,

00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:43.500
and then there's a
decision-making module which

00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:45.960
says, this will be the
size of the earthquake,

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:47.850
therefore this will
be the shaking.

00:19:47.850 --> 00:19:49.470
Should we alert, yes, no.

00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:53.550
All of these modules are quite
complicated and elaborated.

00:19:53.550 --> 00:19:55.170
And then it gets to the people.

00:19:55.170 --> 00:19:56.670
And there are apps,
you can have it

00:19:56.670 --> 00:19:58.980
on your phone that
would tell you

00:19:58.980 --> 00:20:01.710
the level of shaking of
intensity of such will arrive

00:20:01.710 --> 00:20:05.220
at x seconds, or in x seconds.

00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:07.770
So the basis for the
earthquake early warning,

00:20:07.770 --> 00:20:12.030
it's not to say the
earthquake will happen.

00:20:12.030 --> 00:20:14.820
It's to say an
earthquake has happened,

00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:18.270
now the shaking will
happen in such time.

00:20:18.270 --> 00:20:21.150
So you can already see
that the further away you

00:20:21.150 --> 00:20:27.090
are from the fault, the greater
advance knowledge you may have.

00:20:27.090 --> 00:20:29.490
If you're very
close to the faults,

00:20:29.490 --> 00:20:31.740
you may not have a
second of warning.

00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:35.220
So this is not even a point
almost of having warning.

00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:37.170
Although I'd like to say
that that one second,

00:20:37.170 --> 00:20:39.810
and I always think
about this eye surgeon

00:20:39.810 --> 00:20:42.750
with a laser in your eye,
and maybe that one second

00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:45.120
we'll just shut off the
laser and that might actually

00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:46.230
save your eye.

00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:48.720
So even one second is important.

00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:52.860
In Japan, in the
nuclear power plant,

00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:56.100
they have seismometers
three kilometers down.

00:20:56.100 --> 00:21:00.780
And this three kilometers down
with a 3 kilometers per second,

00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:03.300
wave speed, gives you
one second warning,

00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:06.840
is sufficient to shut
down the operations.

00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:11.470
So even those few
seconds matter.

00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:16.980
But for the person, you and
I, or [INAUDIBLE] next week,

00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:22.500
sorry, you might want
some level of warning.

00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:24.510
And so a lot of
the questions have

00:21:24.510 --> 00:21:26.820
been if the earthquake
just happened,

00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:31.650
it may last tens of seconds,
maybe 30, 70 seconds.

00:21:31.650 --> 00:21:33.181
As soon as the
earthquake happens,

00:21:33.181 --> 00:21:34.680
I want to know how
big it is, I want

00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:36.600
to know how much shaking it is.

00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:39.060
Because the longer we
wait for that warning,

00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:40.710
the less Warning we'll have.

00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:45.910
And so a lot of the questions
have been both in the--

00:21:45.910 --> 00:21:47.970
the use of data for
earthquake early warning,

00:21:47.970 --> 00:21:50.190
but in terms of
physics of earthquakes,

00:21:50.190 --> 00:21:53.760
is this beginning pulse,
this beginning onset,

00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:57.620
will carry the information
of the size of the event.

00:21:57.620 --> 00:22:00.630
Another way to say
this is we call that

00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:02.840
the determinism in earthquakes.

00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:04.784
Is the beginning
of the earthquake

00:22:04.784 --> 00:22:06.200
carries enough
information that we

00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:08.720
know what the end of the
earthquake is going to be like,

00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:10.520
therefore we can
tell what magnitude,

00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:13.412
therefore we can tell
what type of shaking.

00:22:13.412 --> 00:22:14.870
And so a lot of
the questions are--

00:22:14.870 --> 00:22:18.080
There's a lot of
skepticism, again related

00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:21.500
to this Parkfield failed
experiment about earthquake

00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:22.850
determinism.

00:22:22.850 --> 00:22:26.510
And so in publications,
I was recommended

00:22:26.510 --> 00:22:30.140
to not use this term, it's
politically not correct.

00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:32.800
But all it says is
there any information

00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:36.880
at the beginning that tells us
the evolution of earthquake?

00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:40.750
And so it's just a word, and
I think there are sides to it,

00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:43.980
and I'm showing
you the both sides.

00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:48.600
And we'll take one side, we'll
see at the end of this talk.

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:50.760
But basically there
are two camps,

00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:52.410
that's why we have debates.

00:22:52.410 --> 00:22:56.440
They are the camp that say yes,
earthquakes are deterministic.

00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:58.930
If we look at the
onset of earthquakes,

00:22:58.930 --> 00:23:01.050
I know what the final
size of the earthquake

00:23:01.050 --> 00:23:03.510
will be before it even ends.

00:23:03.510 --> 00:23:06.280
And then you have the
no camp, which says

00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:08.330
look, all earthquakes look--

00:23:08.330 --> 00:23:10.130
[INAUDIBLE] this
started the same way.

00:23:10.130 --> 00:23:12.050
And I'll explain those plots.

00:23:12.050 --> 00:23:13.710
But the bottom line
is that we have

00:23:13.710 --> 00:23:17.160
different data, different
ways to process it,

00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:18.900
different school of thinking.

00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:24.300
Those are probably the same
earthquakes and we're just--

00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:27.210
we're not coordinated enough
to be very systematic yet

00:23:27.210 --> 00:23:32.570
in our approaches to analyze the
data in a very objective way.

00:23:32.570 --> 00:23:34.850
So on this camp,
these are plots that

00:23:34.850 --> 00:23:39.190
show time of the earthquakes
to some normalization.

00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:43.600
This is in log scale of the
peak ground displacement.

00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:44.530
And the blue--

00:23:44.530 --> 00:23:47.770
The colors are showing you the
magnitude of the earthquake.

00:23:47.770 --> 00:23:52.090
And basically you see that
the way the displacement grows

00:23:52.090 --> 00:23:55.540
with time is not the
same for magnitude 9

00:23:55.540 --> 00:23:57.940
or a magnitude 4 Others say--

00:23:57.940 --> 00:24:03.100
This is a 2014 study that said
small earthquakes start faster

00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:04.880
than big earthquakes.

00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:09.650
This study actually
shows the opposite,

00:24:09.650 --> 00:24:11.420
so I'm not sure the
validity of this.

00:24:11.420 --> 00:24:16.100
But still, it's about
this growth, basically.

00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:19.010
This group shows
that in [INAUDIBLE]..

00:24:19.010 --> 00:24:23.270
By the way, in earth science,
we have so many scales

00:24:23.270 --> 00:24:27.470
that we put everything in
log time, spatial scales.

00:24:27.470 --> 00:24:31.040
We like to collapse things
into this lab log scale.

00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:36.630
So this is the log of the peak
ground displacement in meters.

00:24:36.630 --> 00:24:40.040
This is the log since
the P wave started.

00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:41.810
And so you can see
these are bandwidth

00:24:41.810 --> 00:24:44.120
with earthquake magnitudes.

00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:46.130
You have a lot of--

00:24:46.130 --> 00:24:49.710
I don't think we're really
good statistics, to be honest.

00:24:49.710 --> 00:24:51.870
Because we think that
everything is log normal,

00:24:51.870 --> 00:24:54.350
so we think median and means
and we try to respect this

00:24:54.350 --> 00:24:58.120
but it's not necessarily robust.

00:24:58.120 --> 00:25:01.580
Nonetheless, if we take
the median of these curves,

00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:04.804
of P waves, which are the
first waves that arrive,

00:25:04.804 --> 00:25:07.220
you can see that the beginning,
whatever the magnitude you

00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:09.940
are at, the kind of
look one in the same.

00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:12.620
But this is one data
set, this is one team.

00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:15.820
These guys are saying, I'm using
another data, I don't see this,

00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:18.460
and debate goes
on and on and on.

00:25:18.460 --> 00:25:20.920
And so, it's really
interesting to think

00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:24.080
about there's a lot of
diversity in earthquake

00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:26.360
and so really, how
should we study them?

00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:28.870
We have all these scales
and [INAUDIBLE] scales

00:25:28.870 --> 00:25:32.280
and temporal scales
and so, I think

00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:34.030
we're not really
fully integrated yet,

00:25:34.030 --> 00:25:37.720
but I think there's
hope to do that.

00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:39.892
I'm not yet fully
integrated, but I'm just

00:25:39.892 --> 00:25:42.100
raising the question and I
think eventually we should

00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:45.190
think about all the scales.

00:25:45.190 --> 00:25:49.550
And so-- pardon for the
lack of resolution here,

00:25:49.550 --> 00:25:52.300
there's one way to do it, which
is the camp that I just showed

00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:55.720
you earlier, is you say, I have
all these diverse earthquakes

00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:57.880
and I'm just going to
stack them together.

00:25:57.880 --> 00:26:00.340
I'm going to look at
the average earthquakes.

00:26:00.340 --> 00:26:03.260
And I was telling you
everything's about lognormal.

00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:07.450
So what we do is a lot about
combining those messages

00:26:07.450 --> 00:26:12.170
and then trying to make this
average view of the earthquake.

00:26:12.170 --> 00:26:15.970
And so, if you actually
think this medians and median

00:26:15.970 --> 00:26:18.670
[INAUDIBLE] on all these
earthquake magnitude,

00:26:18.670 --> 00:26:21.490
this is time, this is
getting kind of like what

00:26:21.490 --> 00:26:23.560
the P wave would look like.

00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:26.770
These people found a
triangle function that

00:26:26.770 --> 00:26:28.960
makes it to science right away.

00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:31.469
Triangles are weird
in earthquakes.

00:26:31.469 --> 00:26:34.010
Everything should be lognormal
and should not have any kinks.

00:26:34.010 --> 00:26:36.460
But what they saw
is if we average

00:26:36.460 --> 00:26:41.310
everything over everything
then it looks like the same.

00:26:41.310 --> 00:26:46.570
So that's saying there's just a
common behavior of earthquakes.

00:26:46.570 --> 00:26:49.620
I showed in some of my
work that if I do the same,

00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:51.360
there's some differences
but they're only

00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:54.340
related to earthquake
depth not earthquake sizes.

00:26:54.340 --> 00:26:55.800
So in terms of
predicting magnitude

00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:58.770
you're kind of out of luck.

00:26:58.770 --> 00:27:02.616
So that's one side you can--
strategy for science or saying,

00:27:02.616 --> 00:27:04.490
take all the earthquakes,
average everything,

00:27:04.490 --> 00:27:06.590
find the commonality
between earthquakes,

00:27:06.590 --> 00:27:09.860
simplify the system
as much as possible.

00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:13.200
Or you can embrace
the complexity.

00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:16.950
Earthquakes are so
different from one another,

00:27:16.950 --> 00:27:19.140
and I was telling
you it's lognormal.

00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:22.200
So there's a lot of
differences of those scales.

00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:25.530
So this is just showing you
a little snippet of what

00:27:25.530 --> 00:27:30.060
data sets we're working on is
how different earthquakes look

00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:31.050
like.

00:27:31.050 --> 00:27:34.120
And if they are so different,
what can we say about it?

00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:36.570
Is there any way we
can predict earthquakes

00:27:36.570 --> 00:27:41.100
or the size of the earthquake
if they all look different?

00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:42.790
Another example.

00:27:42.790 --> 00:27:45.060
We got thousands and thousands
of these functions that

00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:50.770
look like earthquakes, but
really they vary a lot.

00:27:50.770 --> 00:27:54.750
So part of the
research that I started

00:27:54.750 --> 00:27:59.760
doing this summer with a really,
really good team of students,

00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:02.070
I was so fortunate.

00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:03.570
I really love
working with students

00:28:03.570 --> 00:28:07.080
who have no a priori on
seismology whatsoever

00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:08.820
and start asking
these questions that

00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:11.480
are so fundamental,
without having the history

00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:14.340
and the package of why
they should not be saying

00:28:14.340 --> 00:28:15.720
determinism.

00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:20.130
So this term was really
very creative, not stubborn,

00:28:20.130 --> 00:28:24.370
but you know very determined
in solving the problem.

00:28:24.370 --> 00:28:27.780
In actually found a
really interesting pattern

00:28:27.780 --> 00:28:30.060
in the complexity
of earthquakes.

00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:33.210
So it's is no longer about
let's simplify everything

00:28:33.210 --> 00:28:35.070
into averaging everything.

00:28:35.070 --> 00:28:37.530
He said let's look
at this complexity,

00:28:37.530 --> 00:28:40.470
embrace it and find patterns.

00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:43.180
And so I will
summarize it in such.

00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:45.060
We have an earthquake here.

00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:50.100
It's a big earthquake, probably
a magnitude 7.5, maybe 8

00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:53.530
given the duration here,
60 second of duration.

00:28:53.530 --> 00:28:55.400
This function could
be like a P wave,

00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:58.170
so you could see that
in a seismometer.

00:28:58.170 --> 00:29:00.705
I'm happy to talk more
details about that later.

00:29:00.705 --> 00:29:02.580
And I'm showing you two
types of earthquakes.

00:29:02.580 --> 00:29:07.050
We have the big one in orange,
the small one in turquoise,

00:29:07.050 --> 00:29:09.750
teal, beautiful color scheme.

00:29:09.750 --> 00:29:11.080
And they look different, right?

00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:13.860
So one is really
complex, lots of bumps.

00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:15.690
They're not the simple
triangle function.

00:29:15.690 --> 00:29:17.273
If you look at
individual earthquakes,

00:29:17.273 --> 00:29:19.590
there are a lot
of richness in it.

00:29:19.590 --> 00:29:21.940
And then the small
one has one bump.

00:29:21.940 --> 00:29:26.330
And so he basically said,
let's count the bumps.

00:29:26.330 --> 00:29:30.650
And he made bumps with
Gaussian functions, lognormal,

00:29:30.650 --> 00:29:33.200
we love it, and he
composed these functions

00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:36.770
by just adding and summing
all of these log functions

00:29:36.770 --> 00:29:40.550
and counting them as
what we called subevents.

00:29:40.550 --> 00:29:42.350
They are not a full
earthquake, they're

00:29:42.350 --> 00:29:45.380
just a small earthquake,
a small event

00:29:45.380 --> 00:29:48.290
that belongs to the earthquake.

00:29:48.290 --> 00:29:50.680
And so it seems like
large earthquakes have

00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:54.455
a lot of bumps, subevents,
and small earthquakes

00:29:54.455 --> 00:29:56.050
have fewer bumps.

00:29:56.050 --> 00:29:59.410
So that's increased complexity
with earthquake size,

00:29:59.410 --> 00:30:02.360
which is not that surprising.

00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:06.320
What was interesting is we could
model this very simply in-house

00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:10.480
with simple fracture
mechanics models,

00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:13.810
where we created earthquakes
with a set of parameters

00:30:13.810 --> 00:30:14.909
I can explain later.

00:30:14.909 --> 00:30:17.200
But basically what we found
is the big earthquakes that

00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:21.630
a lot of bumps and the
small earthquakes--

00:30:21.630 --> 00:30:24.060
smaller earthquake has one bump.

00:30:24.060 --> 00:30:25.060
OK.

00:30:25.060 --> 00:30:27.280
So the number of
bumps or some subevent

00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:29.500
grows with earthquake size.

00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:31.990
This x-axis here is
showing you the size

00:30:31.990 --> 00:30:34.360
of the main event,
the main shock,

00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:37.600
and these are the
number of subevents.

00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:41.490
You can see that with
growing size, this is Tohoku,

00:30:41.490 --> 00:30:45.520
and by all means, an outlier for
everybody to study earthquakes,

00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:47.300
but the biggest
one is the outlier.

00:30:47.300 --> 00:30:51.820
But if you look at ensemble
of the number of subevents,

00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:54.220
you have a growing
number of subevents.

00:30:54.220 --> 00:30:56.290
So big earthquakes
are more complex

00:30:56.290 --> 00:30:58.540
because they have
more subevents.

00:30:58.540 --> 00:31:03.200
However, it's not we don't
have a log scale here.

00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:05.250
And so actually, the
size of the subevents

00:31:05.250 --> 00:31:08.160
grows also with the
size of the earthquake.

00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:10.350
And that was really
the breakthrough,

00:31:10.350 --> 00:31:13.320
is that we don't have a
characteristic bump that

00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:16.320
tells us a characteristic
length scale in the earth.

00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:18.050
Instead the earthquake
dynamics has

00:31:18.050 --> 00:31:22.170
this interesting and
intrinsic link scale

00:31:22.170 --> 00:31:24.810
that is characteristic
to the earthquake's size.

00:31:24.810 --> 00:31:27.780
All of these dots
are a subevent that

00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:31.440
has a size shown in here
in log scale attached

00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:34.840
to the size of the main
earthquake shown here.

00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:36.870
These lines, this
is a one to one

00:31:36.870 --> 00:31:40.620
line saying the subevent
here has the same size

00:31:40.620 --> 00:31:44.850
as its master
earthquake, in which case

00:31:44.850 --> 00:31:48.870
this earthquake probably only
has one subevent to form it.

00:31:48.870 --> 00:31:51.660
This line here is showing
you that earthquakes

00:31:51.660 --> 00:31:54.630
would have about 100
bumps, 100 subevents,

00:31:54.630 --> 00:31:57.000
to form the earthquake.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:59.970
And so what you can see, it
is not an infinite amount.

00:31:59.970 --> 00:32:02.250
The subevents don't
have the same size.

00:32:02.250 --> 00:32:05.940
These events actually grow
with earthquake magnitude.

00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:07.930
And so what was interesting,
the current scale

00:32:07.930 --> 00:32:11.920
is representing
the distribution.

00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:14.770
And so, these small
events tend to have

00:32:14.770 --> 00:32:19.330
mostly one main subevent,
versus the large event

00:32:19.330 --> 00:32:21.190
have a lot more.

00:32:21.190 --> 00:32:24.130
And if you were to
draw kind of a scaling,

00:32:24.130 --> 00:32:28.521
it's not one to one but
some very strong scaling.

00:32:28.521 --> 00:32:30.770
So that means in terms of
structure of the earthquake,

00:32:30.770 --> 00:32:33.890
a small event has a small
bump and the big event

00:32:33.890 --> 00:32:36.480
has a big bump at the beginning.

00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:40.340
So let's say you measure
this, you can tell crudely

00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:44.170
what size of the earthquake
it is, which is fine,

00:32:44.170 --> 00:32:45.327
the earthquake is done.

00:32:45.327 --> 00:32:47.035
But if you go to those
larger magnitudes,

00:32:47.035 --> 00:32:49.450
if you measure this
first bump, then you

00:32:49.450 --> 00:32:53.720
can predict or estimate the
final size of the event.

00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:56.210
Without the earthquake, the
earthquake is not done yet,

00:32:56.210 --> 00:33:01.060
you're just making an inference
based on this organization

00:33:01.060 --> 00:33:04.280
of the seismic signal.

00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:06.760
And so we took this
independent data set,

00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:09.930
we looked at this recent
Indonesia earthquake

00:33:09.930 --> 00:33:12.720
in 2018, 7.5.

00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:14.320
It was large.

00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:16.510
Was not really on a
map fault, per se,

00:33:16.510 --> 00:33:19.220
it was not really on
the plate boundary.

00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:21.820
It's one of those
earthquakes that just tell us

00:33:21.820 --> 00:33:23.140
we don't know much.

00:33:23.140 --> 00:33:24.940
[INAUDIBLE] just on
plate boundaries.

00:33:24.940 --> 00:33:27.440
Earthquakes happen
in unforeseen places,

00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:30.400
so we can't really just
predict an earthquake tomorrow,

00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:32.860
but these are the
earthquakes that remind us

00:33:32.860 --> 00:33:34.630
how young our field is.

00:33:34.630 --> 00:33:36.550
So the top function
is showing you

00:33:36.550 --> 00:33:41.470
the same, what will be a P
wave as a function of time.

00:33:41.470 --> 00:33:44.140
And then we fit in all
these Gaussian functions,

00:33:44.140 --> 00:33:46.010
joining these dashed lines.

00:33:46.010 --> 00:33:48.460
And at the bottom, this
is one of our attempts

00:33:48.460 --> 00:33:53.140
to say why it would be,
given this bump, our estimate

00:33:53.140 --> 00:33:56.450
of the magnitude of
the final earthquake.

00:33:56.450 --> 00:33:59.510
This green line is showing
you the past magnitude.

00:33:59.510 --> 00:34:02.300
This says, if I
integrate here this,

00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:04.710
I had a small
earthquake, shown here.

00:34:04.710 --> 00:34:06.770
And if I go on, a lot of
the earthquake has gone.

00:34:06.770 --> 00:34:09.110
And so by the end of
the day, the magnitude

00:34:09.110 --> 00:34:12.320
is whatever is gone until here.

00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:13.770
And so these dots
are showing you,

00:34:13.770 --> 00:34:17.000
with some kind of refinements,
that we do along time

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:20.360
that our first estimate
here is within a few seconds

00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:21.600
of the earthquake.

00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:24.050
We are not far off
the final magnitude,

00:34:24.050 --> 00:34:28.010
although the earthquake
hasn't really gone yet.

00:34:28.010 --> 00:34:30.090
And so, that was quite exciting.

00:34:30.090 --> 00:34:32.960
It's not this
nucleation phase where

00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:35.449
we can see this aseismic slip.

00:34:35.449 --> 00:34:37.469
We don't wait for the
end of the earthquake.

00:34:37.469 --> 00:34:41.480
We're kind of like this nice
warning of about 40 seconds,

00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:43.159
possibly a warning ahead.

00:34:43.159 --> 00:34:47.020
So we're close to a
minute more warning.

00:34:47.020 --> 00:34:51.100
And so to give you a sense of
how earthquake early warning

00:34:51.100 --> 00:34:54.909
works today, this is the one
is being estimated for Japan.

00:34:54.909 --> 00:34:58.500
JM is a Japanese
meteorological agency.

00:34:58.500 --> 00:35:01.180
These stands for earthquake
early warning system.

00:35:01.180 --> 00:35:02.950
Study from Minson and others.

00:35:02.950 --> 00:35:05.800
And they looked at a
few Japanese earthquake

00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:06.340
with those--

00:35:06.340 --> 00:35:09.750
STF stands for that function
I was showing you earlier.

00:35:09.750 --> 00:35:11.500
These are magnitude
of the main earthquake

00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:14.560
and these are time,
basically rupture time,

00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:15.549
of the earthquake.

00:35:15.549 --> 00:35:16.840
So these are small earthquakes.

00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:18.344
They are shorter.

00:35:18.344 --> 00:35:19.510
And these are the functions.

00:35:19.510 --> 00:35:22.060
I was showing you a green
one, this is a black one.

00:35:22.060 --> 00:35:24.220
This was a large
earthquake, magnitude 9.

00:35:24.220 --> 00:35:27.586
This was a magnitude
7, magnitude 6.9.

00:35:27.586 --> 00:35:28.960
And what they're
showing you here

00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:33.970
is basically the estimate of the
earthquake early warning system

00:35:33.970 --> 00:35:35.440
there in Japan.

00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:40.750
So during the Tohoku earthquake,
they waited about 20 seconds

00:35:40.750 --> 00:35:44.290
after the earthquake started
to issue a first magnitude

00:35:44.290 --> 00:35:45.550
estimate.

00:35:45.550 --> 00:35:48.280
They soon realized that
the amplitude was big

00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:50.030
and so it was a
large earthquake.

00:35:50.030 --> 00:35:54.400
So they estimated within 25
seconds it was a magnitude 7.

00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:56.230
And then as time goes,
you get more data,

00:35:56.230 --> 00:35:57.610
you refine your estimate.

00:35:57.610 --> 00:35:59.950
Their final estimate
was really off

00:35:59.950 --> 00:36:01.930
by one or two of
magnitude, which

00:36:01.930 --> 00:36:05.170
is equivalent to a 30
times difference in size

00:36:05.170 --> 00:36:07.400
of earthquakes.

00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:08.990
And this is showing
you the function

00:36:08.990 --> 00:36:11.520
before, this is the true
size of the earthquake.

00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:13.880
So I was telling you we
failed at really predicting

00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:16.062
this Tohoku earthquake,
but if we were

00:36:16.062 --> 00:36:17.270
to look at other earthquakes.

00:36:17.270 --> 00:36:19.670
I'm just showing you dots of
where our prediction would

00:36:19.670 --> 00:36:20.870
be in time.

00:36:20.870 --> 00:36:25.070
And we really would be a lot
faster than current system

00:36:25.070 --> 00:36:28.790
if this were implemented
in earthquake.

00:36:28.790 --> 00:36:31.310
And so we looked at mini events.

00:36:31.310 --> 00:36:33.340
We have 3000 of those.

00:36:33.340 --> 00:36:37.310
And we made this figure that
shows relative to duration

00:36:37.310 --> 00:36:39.140
time of the earthquake.

00:36:39.140 --> 00:36:41.750
These are all those
subevents or bumps,

00:36:41.750 --> 00:36:46.040
estimated magnitude for the
last earthquake, the large one.

00:36:46.040 --> 00:36:51.342
And what we found is
usually between 10% and 20%,

00:36:51.342 --> 00:36:52.800
at the beginning
of the earthquake,

00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:55.010
we can tell what
magnitude it is.

00:36:55.010 --> 00:36:58.356
It has some nice features to it.

00:36:58.356 --> 00:36:59.480
I'm happy to talk about it.

00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:01.880
It has to do with the
structure of the subevents.

00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:04.460
But the bottom line is that
we can predict the magnitude

00:37:04.460 --> 00:37:05.960
before it stops.

00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:08.450
But it was not really
fancy, it was just

00:37:08.450 --> 00:37:13.510
truly finding a pattern in
the complexity of earthquakes.

00:37:13.510 --> 00:37:17.590
So these types of savings could
be between 10 and 30 seconds

00:37:17.590 --> 00:37:24.790
of saving of magnitude,
which is quite significant.

00:37:24.790 --> 00:37:27.750
So I wanted to show you a new
perspective on what machine

00:37:27.750 --> 00:37:31.890
learning, or buzzword being
artificial intelligence,

00:37:31.890 --> 00:37:36.090
could do for
predicting earthquakes.

00:37:36.090 --> 00:37:39.210
We're going to turn back
into lab quakes, which

00:37:39.210 --> 00:37:42.250
predicts very
nicely already what

00:37:42.250 --> 00:37:43.500
earthquakes will look like.

00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:45.030
But I think there's
a lot of hope

00:37:45.030 --> 00:37:47.010
to use those methods
to really try

00:37:47.010 --> 00:37:50.880
to find patterns in the
current data set that we have.

00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:54.330
And let's say that
we currently work 10,

00:37:54.330 --> 00:37:58.080
20 terabytes data set is normal,
especially for my post doc,

00:37:58.080 --> 00:38:00.780
who overloaded the
Harvard tester last night

00:38:00.780 --> 00:38:02.340
with many terabytes of data.

00:38:02.340 --> 00:38:05.110
So we have a lot
of data to look at.

00:38:05.110 --> 00:38:08.100
So this study is
showing you that they

00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:11.790
were able to predict when the
next earthquake, lab quake,

00:38:11.790 --> 00:38:15.750
would happen, just by looking
at these ambient vibrations.

00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:19.760
And so in lab, you can
replicate the earthquake cycle

00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:23.070
a lot faster, so you have
multiple earthquakes.

00:38:23.070 --> 00:38:27.170
And I was showing you the Alpine
fault it's every 300 years.

00:38:27.170 --> 00:38:30.290
We don't have 300
years of seismograms.

00:38:30.290 --> 00:38:34.340
And so you can kind of
speed up this process

00:38:34.340 --> 00:38:36.650
and look at those patterns
for the earthquake cycle.

00:38:36.650 --> 00:38:40.430
So what they found is looking
at these ambient vibrations is

00:38:40.430 --> 00:38:43.340
when the earthquake happened
here and the stress drops,

00:38:43.340 --> 00:38:44.990
the waves look like this.

00:38:44.990 --> 00:38:47.060
And then when the earthquake
is close to failure,

00:38:47.060 --> 00:38:50.750
you may have some of those
more impulsive events.

00:38:50.750 --> 00:38:52.460
But what was interesting
is they managed

00:38:52.460 --> 00:38:56.030
to using this
ambient time series

00:38:56.030 --> 00:39:00.110
to predict the time to
failure through time here

00:39:00.110 --> 00:39:01.590
during the experiment.

00:39:01.590 --> 00:39:04.700
And so their prediction
was shown in blue,

00:39:04.700 --> 00:39:06.380
with a random first algorithm.

00:39:06.380 --> 00:39:08.690
And then what the
experimental data was showing

00:39:08.690 --> 00:39:10.045
is shown in red.

00:39:10.045 --> 00:39:12.650
And these are the
validation part.

00:39:12.650 --> 00:39:16.190
And so it's really stunning that
even though it's not regular,

00:39:16.190 --> 00:39:20.300
these predictions were able
to show a weaker earthquake

00:39:20.300 --> 00:39:22.350
compared to a big earthquake.

00:39:22.350 --> 00:39:26.090
So I thought it was one of
the most promising study

00:39:26.090 --> 00:39:29.500
for machine learning
to predict earthquakes.

00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:32.850
In-house, our team
at Harvard has

00:39:32.850 --> 00:39:37.566
been able to predict the
location of aftershocks.

00:39:37.566 --> 00:39:39.690
And so as I was telling
you, we have the main shock

00:39:39.690 --> 00:39:41.730
and then we have many
aftershocks, which

00:39:41.730 --> 00:39:43.380
is something we forget about.

00:39:43.380 --> 00:39:46.620
If your building is already
shaken by the main one,

00:39:46.620 --> 00:39:49.660
you will have many
more earthquakes to go.

00:39:49.660 --> 00:39:52.740
The building is going to have to
deal with many more earthquakes

00:39:52.740 --> 00:39:54.730
and aftershocks.

00:39:54.730 --> 00:39:56.850
And so what this
study was showing

00:39:56.850 --> 00:40:00.180
is that if you look
at those black dots,

00:40:00.180 --> 00:40:04.110
the fault is showing at
these yellow patches.

00:40:04.110 --> 00:40:07.650
The red is showing basically
the change in stress,

00:40:07.650 --> 00:40:10.680
and then you can predict
from the slip that happened

00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:12.120
on the previous earthquake.

00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:14.700
And they worked with
multiple earthquakes here.

00:40:14.700 --> 00:40:17.370
And what they found is
that the traditional way

00:40:17.370 --> 00:40:20.310
of looking at where an
earthquake would be,

00:40:20.310 --> 00:40:22.740
given a change of
stress in the crust,

00:40:22.740 --> 00:40:26.550
failed to predict many,
many of the aftershocks.

00:40:26.550 --> 00:40:30.450
But instead, they found
within your network

00:40:30.450 --> 00:40:32.910
that you could tease
out a metric, a better

00:40:32.910 --> 00:40:36.480
metric to predict where
aftershocks would be,

00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:40.110
which has to do with
stress invariance.

00:40:40.110 --> 00:40:41.820
But basically these
approaches were

00:40:41.820 --> 00:40:45.240
successful at
predicting the location

00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:47.050
of the next earthquake.

00:40:47.050 --> 00:40:49.262
And so this is
short-term forecast.

00:40:49.262 --> 00:40:51.470
It's not saying years ahead
we'll have an earthquake.

00:40:51.470 --> 00:40:53.316
It's saying we
had an earthquake,

00:40:53.316 --> 00:40:54.690
we know there will
be aftershock.

00:40:54.690 --> 00:40:57.420
And it's saying where the
next aftershock could be.

00:41:00.380 --> 00:41:02.160
Other things that
machine learning

00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:05.600
has been really successful
at in seismology

00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:09.020
is detecting those very weak,
weak ground motions that

00:41:09.020 --> 00:41:11.190
are buried in seismic noise.

00:41:11.190 --> 00:41:16.160
And it has a really
good [INAUDIBLE],,

00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:20.780
that was one of the first to use
a deep neural network to detect

00:41:20.780 --> 00:41:21.950
earthquakes.

00:41:21.950 --> 00:41:25.011
And we all worked
in Oklahoma, we

00:41:25.011 --> 00:41:27.260
worked on the data set that
already had a few thousand

00:41:27.260 --> 00:41:29.450
events, but we were
able to detect something

00:41:29.450 --> 00:41:31.280
like 20 times more events.

00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:34.010
And these are shown here,
with those beautiful S

00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:36.920
wave and P waves all aligned.

00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:40.340
And we have hundreds and
hundreds of those events

00:41:40.340 --> 00:41:42.375
that we can look at the
wave forms and say ha,

00:41:42.375 --> 00:41:43.750
actually there
was an earthquake,

00:41:43.750 --> 00:41:46.610
we just had not detected it with
natural and more established

00:41:46.610 --> 00:41:48.230
methods.

00:41:48.230 --> 00:41:51.710
And so in terms of
prediction, I think

00:41:51.710 --> 00:41:53.930
there's a lot of hope
with the new methods,

00:41:53.930 --> 00:41:57.440
and mostly the past
recording of data,

00:41:57.440 --> 00:41:59.300
where we can
potentially tease out

00:41:59.300 --> 00:42:02.300
some of these short-term
term forecasts.

00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:03.590
And I will stop here.

00:42:03.590 --> 00:42:04.400
Thank you.

00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:07.750
[APPLAUSE]
