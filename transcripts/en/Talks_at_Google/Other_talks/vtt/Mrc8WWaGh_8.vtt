LISA LEE: Good
afternoon, everyone.

00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:04.880
And welcome to another exciting
event here at Tech Corners.

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.230
And I want to give a
huge shout-out to Regina.

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:09.070
Where is she?

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:09.570
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.810
Thank you, Regina,
for coordinating all

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:14.022
your hard work that
goes into this.

00:00:14.022 --> 00:00:14.980
I mean it took an hour.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.690
But it takes her weeks, I'm
sure, to put this all together.

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:19.484
I'm Lisa Lee.

00:00:19.484 --> 00:00:21.400
And I'm really incredibly
excited to introduce

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.770
Luboc Azria, the chief creative
officer at BCBG Max Azria

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.150
Group, a global fashion house,
with one of the hottest labels

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:31.400
and brands in the
fashion industry today,

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.420
that styles everyday
modern women like you

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.040
and I, in the contemporary
price point range,

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.530
to supermodels and
Hollywood celebrities.

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.970
She joined the company
as a designer in 1991

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.540
and was named creative
director in 1996.

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.370
Under her influence-- and
I've been told that she's also

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.100
known as the muse
of the company--

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.100
it evolved from an emerging
line to one of America's leading

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.980
design houses, including being
the first American design house

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.040
to absorb the esteemed French
fashion house, Herve Leger.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.770
She's joining us
here today at Google

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:08.350
to share an exclusive screening
of the 2015 Spring Runway Show

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.350
and to provide it with
some personal commentary.

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.040
LUBOC AZRIA: Absolutely.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.498
LISA LEE: And if
that isn't enough,

00:01:12.498 --> 00:01:14.150
I'm really impressed
that she's also

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.320
a mother of six,
three [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.274
[CHEERS]

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.380
So you'll have to tell
us your secret and how

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:21.720
you balance all that.

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.880
And obviously, you
look so beautiful.

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.030
So welcome to Google.

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:26.080
LUBOC AZRIA: Thank you.

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.070
Hi everyone.

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:29.786
How's everybody doing today?

00:01:29.786 --> 00:01:30.411
AUDIENCE: Good.

00:01:30.411 --> 00:01:31.161
LUBOC AZRIA: Good.

00:01:31.161 --> 00:01:33.420
Well, I'm very happy to be here.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.780
So it's very exciting.

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.660
And I think we
should start, right?

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:37.320
LISA LEE: Yes.

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.329
So really just to start
off so that everyone

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:40.870
gets to know you a
little bit better,

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:42.828
if you can tell us a
little bit about yourself,

00:01:42.828 --> 00:01:44.550
and some of your
passions, and how

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.060
that translates into your
personal style, and the work

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.590
that you do?

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:55.570
LUBOC AZRIA: So I'm
originally from Ukraine, Kiev.

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:02.950
How many of you actually
were not born here?

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:04.290
OK.

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.782
So you'll love this story.

00:02:05.782 --> 00:02:08.479
So briefly, I was born in Kiev.

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.230
And I think that your
cultural background sometimes

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:13.410
defines you.

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.900
I think when I was
growing up, I was

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.720
meant to be a prima ballerina.

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.247
So from the age of
4 and 1/2 to 5--

00:02:23.247 --> 00:02:25.330
actually, I was about 5
years old, where they come

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.010
and they test you, how limber
you are and everything else.

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.600
Your life is determined.

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.210
And so I trained in-- there's
like little satellite groups

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:36.470
of Kirov ballet.

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.710
So that's how my
initial training was.

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:41.200
But my true passion
was always art.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.080
And I loved drawing
and painting.

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.330
And I took art classes.

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:53.390
Anyway, in the 1980s, Brezhnev
signed an agreement with Israel

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.140
to let the Jews out.

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:56.040
I'm Jewish.

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.180
And there was a huge
prosecution against Jews.

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.440
We couldn't attend universities.

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.369
We couldn't actually
get higher jobs.

00:03:03.369 --> 00:03:04.660
We couldn't do a lot of things.

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:09.550
So my parents were
lucky enough to leave.

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.550
And so we immigrated
to the United States.

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:18.460
And the place that we end
up in is San Antonio, Texas.

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:19.360
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.590
Of all the places, it
was San Antonio, Texas.

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.240
And so I really started
growing up there.

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:29.600
And I have to say that I never
thought of fashion as fashion,

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.640
like I didn't know the
fashion industry existed.

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.750
In the former
Soviet Union, it was

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.670
like everybody was wearing the
same thing over and over again.

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.090
So I didn't really realize
that there was a fashion world.

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.660
All I wanted to do was to
be an art history professor.

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:46.920
So I studied art.

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.400
I was really
passionate about it.

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.120
And obviously, I danced
as well, on the side.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:58.000
And so in 1986, there was
an oil crisis in Texas.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.600
And a lot of people
lost their jobs.

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.836
And so we moved
from San Antonio,

00:04:01.836 --> 00:04:03.460
Texas-- and I know
it's a lot of story.

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:08.370
But there's a good point to it.

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.680
So we moved from San Antonio,
Texas to Los Angeles.

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.450
And I remember being in LA.

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:15.000
And I am 18 years old.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.550
And I don't know
what my future is.

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:18.680
All I know is that
I want to be in art.

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.370
I want to be in something
that really has--

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:23.930
the possibilities are endless.

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.180
And I can create something
that can make a difference.

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.350
So anyway, I am in Los Angeles.

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:30.340
And it's two weeks
after I arrived there.

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.760
And I decided to go shopping.

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:35.040
And I went on
Wilshire Boulevard.

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.556
So I'm just walking on Wilshire.

00:04:36.556 --> 00:04:38.430
I don't know if you
guys, any of you know LA?

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:41.390
But it's like a-- anyway,
there's large department stores

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.890
there.

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:44.440
So I was walking by one
of the department stores.

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.440
And there was the most
beautiful dress in the window.

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.190
I mean the dress
was so stunning.

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:52.942
And I decided that I'm
just going to go in.

00:04:52.942 --> 00:04:54.650
I've never been to
this department store.

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:56.880
But I'm going to go
in and try it on.

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.290
As I walk in, I ask for the
dress that in the window.

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:05.640
And the sales person there said,
well, it's on the second floor.

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:07.130
We having a new trunk show.

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:08.300
They gave me the dress.

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:13.310
And so I went into the
dressing room, put it on.

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:14.355
It was stunning.

00:05:14.355 --> 00:05:17.410
It was the most beautiful
thing I've ever had on.

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:19.400
I started twirling in the dress.

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:26.372
I mean just having a good time,
until I saw the price tag.

00:05:26.372 --> 00:05:28.330
And the price-- now,
remember, this is in 1986.

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:31.820
So the price tag was $3,000.

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:34.464
And I remember my
car was $1,500.

00:05:34.464 --> 00:05:35.440
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.490
So that it was
not going to work.

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:41.010
And at that moment,
as I was looking

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:44.740
at myself in the mirror, at
that moment that pain hit me.

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:47.630
The pain was that
I'm not good enough.

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:48.530
What am I doing here?

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:52.390
People like me don't
wear clothes like that.

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:54.390
Really, like all
the negative things

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:56.920
just started flowing through me.

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:59.640
And I started crying, but
sort of tearing up more.

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:01.260
And then I pulled
myself together.

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.760
I looked in the mirror
and I said, if I ever,

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:06.710
ever become a
designer, I will never

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:08.460
make clothes that
are that expensive.

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:12.550
I will never make a
woman feel this pain.

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:15.570
Nobody deserves
to feel this pain.

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:16.830
And I made that promise.

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:18.571
I took off my dress.

00:06:18.571 --> 00:06:21.070
Now, again, I didn't know it
that I wanted to be a designer.

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:22.702
I had no idea.

00:06:22.702 --> 00:06:24.410
Took off the dress,
put it on the hanger,

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:29.870
zipped it up, thanked the
sales people, and left.

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:31.740
Next day, believe it
or not-- not next day,

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:35.430
but like two days after,
a fashion school came in.

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:38.760
And I filled out,
saying I liked fashion.

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:39.830
I like this.

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:43.570
My whole life from that moment
on-- it's like in that movie

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:47.020
when you make a promise,
everything, like, starts

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:50.750
opening for you, everything
in my life from that point on.

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:53.475
I went to fashion school-- well,
I filled out a application.

00:06:53.475 --> 00:06:55.600
The next thing I knew, I
was in the fashion school.

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:58.020
The next thing I
knew, I had a job.

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:02.240
It was just everything
was just incredibly--

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:05.360
it's like my destiny was
created at that moment.

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:07.670
And I don't know if any of
you had that experience.

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:11.502
But it's just sort of, you do
thing and you make a promise.

00:07:11.502 --> 00:07:13.210
And then everything
in your life changes.

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:16.180
And so to me,
fashion represents--

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:17.577
it's not just about clothes.

00:07:17.577 --> 00:07:19.035
But it's about
making a difference.

00:07:19.035 --> 00:07:20.690
Do you know I'm saying?

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:23.390
I believe that if you make a
woman feel and look beautiful,

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:25.340
she can make this
world a better place.

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:26.850
LISA LEE: So it looks like
it all crystallized for you.

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:27.600
LUBOC AZRIA: Yeah.

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:28.230
Yeah.

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:29.900
LISA LEE: And so
from that point on,

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:33.580
how does that experience--
how does that translate

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:38.230
to your designs today, and
the labels, and what you do?

00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:40.360
LUBOC AZRIA: Well, it
translates in every way.

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:43.170
I mean until this day, I
fit every single piece.

00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:46.042
I also kind of realized
that-- for example, I

00:07:46.042 --> 00:07:48.250
don't know if you know
anything about making clothes.

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:52.040
But you can take a dress that
you're wearing, for example.

00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:56.560
You can take a dress
like this and you

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:58.830
can have it 10 times
more expensive,

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:01.922
if you don't think about the
marker, and the fabrication,

00:08:01.922 --> 00:08:02.630
and how it moves.

00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:05.360
So we really engineer
everything to give you

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:08.160
the best price that we can.

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:11.861
Because I believe that a
woman has to feel good.

00:08:11.861 --> 00:08:14.140
Most designers
don't appreciate, I

00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:16.820
think, the consumer and
their spending power.

00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:19.440
Or their knowledge, I
think I would want to say.

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:21.560
Like, women are so much smarter.

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:24.390
You don't have to be in fashion
business to understand fashion.

00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:25.570
You don't have to be.

00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:27.420
You know what you like.

00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:29.240
And that's the most
important thing.

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:32.110
Fashion is about
connecting with something.

00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:35.340
So what I do is I create
clothes that I want to wear.

00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:35.870
I'm a woman.

00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:38.409
It's so interesting because
in design, we always

00:08:38.409 --> 00:08:39.860
think that we're somebody else.

00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:40.525
But we're not.

00:08:40.525 --> 00:08:41.760
We're women.

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:44.990
The majority of my
team is also females.

00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:46.550
And then we love what we do.

00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:48.020
We get excited
about the product.

00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:49.860
We can't wait to
wear it ourselves.

00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:52.599
We can't wait to create
a product that we

00:08:52.599 --> 00:08:53.640
respect and want to wear.

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:55.760
And I think that's
the difference.

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:57.820
We don't have to
do a lot of things.

00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:03.120
Like I will not create clothes
just to create clothes.

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:05.880
I really want somebody
wearing it and feeling

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:08.020
beautiful and elegant.

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:10.994
And I believe that
you live one life.

00:09:10.994 --> 00:09:12.410
How do you want
to live your life?

00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:13.940
Do you want to
hide behind clothes

00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:15.829
or do you want to
celebrate yourself?

00:09:15.829 --> 00:09:17.620
And if somebody would
take a picture of you

00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:20.780
every single day, would
you be proud of that?

00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:22.200
You know, one life.

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:25.890
And so to me, that's
very important.

00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:28.400
LISA LEE: That's really,
really inspirational.

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:30.760
And I think it's something
for people to keep in mind.

00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:33.180
But many of us
here, I'm sure, are

00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:37.180
busy working women, as well
as some of us have kids.

00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:39.220
And so how do you
balance that in terms

00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:42.160
of getting up every day and
to think about yourself first,

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:45.390
as opposed to your family and
all the other responsibilities?

00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:47.848
LUBOC AZRIA: Well, like I said,
think about yourself first.

00:09:47.848 --> 00:09:51.330
I mean there's a safety
message on the plane.

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:55.790
It says when the
oxygen mask comes down,

00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:58.962
put it on yourself first,
and then on your children.

00:09:58.962 --> 00:10:00.670
And I think a lot of
women don't do that.

00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:02.400
We tend to take care
of everybody else.

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:05.070
And then we feel like
something's wrong with us.

00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:08.160
And I think truly taking care
of yourself is so important.

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:09.660
And I'm not talking
about that idea.

00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:13.900
I'm talking about exercising,
eating right, doing the things

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:14.540
that you love.

00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:17.900
If you love, for example, I
don't know, roller blading,

00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:18.720
go rollerblade.

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:22.159
If you love, making jewelry--
if you love anything,

00:10:22.159 --> 00:10:24.450
do you know what I'm saying,
make sure you're doing it.

00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:27.500
Because that is what's
going to satisfy who you are

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:29.650
and create-- in life,
you don't find yourself.

00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:30.590
You create yourself.

00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:32.840
So create the type of
person that you want to be.

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:35.450
Most people go around
the world and go, oh,

00:10:35.450 --> 00:10:36.504
this person is so chic.

00:10:36.504 --> 00:10:37.420
She was born that way.

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:38.820
She wasn't born that way.

00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:40.185
She created herself.

00:10:40.185 --> 00:10:41.380
Do you now what I'm saying?

00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:41.990
She watched.

00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:42.930
She learned.

00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:44.360
And she wanted to
be that person.

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:46.350
So you become that.

00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:48.360
And I think in terms of
balance and being a mom,

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:50.270
I think being a mom
is one of the greatest

00:10:50.270 --> 00:10:52.090
gifts in the world.

00:10:52.090 --> 00:10:54.990
I mean those kids are
our greatest teachers.

00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:56.370
And yes, they're tough.

00:10:56.370 --> 00:10:59.330
But that's because they're
trying to find who they are.

00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:02.020
And we just have
to let them grow.

00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:05.240
And I think being friends with
your children is so important.

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:07.580
I think we're always trying
to tell them what to do.

00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:09.062
And I think, don't.

00:11:09.062 --> 00:11:10.520
I think they'll do
the right thing.

00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:12.350
I notice the less I
tell them what to do,

00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:14.510
the more strict they
are on themselves.

00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:16.650
And I have five
daughters so it's

00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:18.460
kind of like-- it's
a party at the house.

00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:20.460
LISA LEE: So I have to
ask, because my daughter,

00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:22.620
they always decide
what they want to wear.

00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:24.433
And it doesn't always match.

00:11:24.433 --> 00:11:25.400
LUBOC AZRIA: Oh.

00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:26.130
LISA LEE: And you're
like, do you really

00:11:26.130 --> 00:11:27.713
want to put those
two things together?

00:11:27.713 --> 00:11:29.732
So do you let them
experiment and let them?

00:11:29.732 --> 00:11:30.440
LUBOC AZRIA: Yes.

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:34.560
Actually, I think that's how you
create fashion, by being wrong.

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:38.400
I don't think fashion should--
I mean we don't match here.

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:40.009
It's a piece that she likes.

00:11:40.009 --> 00:11:41.800
She probably likes this
great pair of shoes

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:45.710
and she just wants-- it's about
certain things that they love.

00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:46.810
And let them do it.

00:11:46.810 --> 00:11:49.160
I mean I remember my kids,
I couldn't get them out

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:53.880
of Halloween costumes
for, like, a year.

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:56.680
And I said, hey, if you want
to be a superwoman, go ahead,

00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:59.730
every single day, or tutus.

00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:02.580
I mean that was, like, number
one search word, right?

00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:05.380
Or like a item, tutu skirts.

00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:07.260
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:11.820
Mine is in the car, with the
bathing suit and flip-flops.

00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:12.580
No.

00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:13.590
But it is.

00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:15.220
Just let her be.

00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:17.210
I mean obviously she
has a reason for it.

00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:18.704
How beautiful is that?

00:12:18.704 --> 00:12:19.370
LISA LEE: Right.

00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:21.870
And so you often hear
people define their style.

00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:27.990
They saying I'm casual or
I like the bohemian look.

00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:28.950
Do you believe in that?

00:12:28.950 --> 00:12:31.950
Or do you feel like it's-- like
you talked about experimenting.

00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:35.460
And so what is behind
that definition

00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:38.049
and do you encourage women
to sort of throw that

00:12:38.049 --> 00:12:39.590
out the window and
say just wear what

00:12:39.590 --> 00:12:41.966
you feel is most comfortable
and defines you for the day?

00:12:41.966 --> 00:12:42.756
LUBOC AZRIA: Uh-uh.

00:12:42.756 --> 00:12:44.370
I think it depends
on your lifestyle.

00:12:44.370 --> 00:12:46.930
I think that most
of us-- I mean,

00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:48.540
it depends if you
want to blend in.

00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:51.972
Like, I think that women
should experiment with stuff.

00:12:51.972 --> 00:12:52.930
I think that's playing.

00:12:52.930 --> 00:12:55.549
Do you remember when we used
to play with clothes, dress-up,

00:12:55.549 --> 00:12:56.090
and all this?

00:12:56.090 --> 00:12:56.930
What happened to us?

00:12:56.930 --> 00:12:57.900
We stopped playing.

00:12:57.900 --> 00:13:00.200
We stopped experimenting.

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:02.760
We stopped living.

00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:05.660
If you're taking fashion too
serious, you're doing it wrong.

00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:08.650
You're supposed to go in and try
every single thing in the store

00:13:08.650 --> 00:13:09.830
and have fun.

00:13:09.830 --> 00:13:12.840
Because women do not
dress based on trends.

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:15.880
They dress based on
their body shape, period.

00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:18.260
You know what's going to
look good on you, right away.

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:20.210
You don't need a
salesperson to tell you.

00:13:20.210 --> 00:13:22.625
So you know if you look
good in strapless dresses,

00:13:22.625 --> 00:13:23.750
you wear strapless dresses.

00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:25.916
If you look good in v-neck,
you look good in v-neck.

00:13:28.890 --> 00:13:30.130
That's because you know it.

00:13:30.130 --> 00:13:32.630
You put it on and it's right.

00:13:32.630 --> 00:13:35.789
And that's the difference.

00:13:35.789 --> 00:13:37.580
Comfort, obviously, is
extremely important.

00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:40.370
But you can be
elegantly comfortable.

00:13:40.370 --> 00:13:43.090
LISA LEE: So when you are
feeling a little down or maybe

00:13:43.090 --> 00:13:45.750
feeling you don't quite
have the confidence,

00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:48.700
what's your go-to outfit that
you'd sort of recommend people

00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:49.240
think about.

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:55.132
LUBOC AZRIA: A really
big muumuu, sunglasses.

00:13:55.132 --> 00:13:56.910
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:56.910 --> 00:13:58.010
Yeah.

00:13:58.010 --> 00:14:03.166
Those are the days where
you're just having a good day.

00:14:03.166 --> 00:14:04.408
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:07.190
I love muumuus.

00:14:07.190 --> 00:14:09.510
I have nothing against muumuus.

00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:11.142
They're great.

00:14:11.142 --> 00:14:13.225
LISA LEE: And so you talked
about your background,

00:14:13.225 --> 00:14:17.010
and your culture, and
dance, for instance.

00:14:17.010 --> 00:14:20.280
Has that influenced
your focus on comfort?

00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:21.710
Because obviously
as a dancer, you

00:14:21.710 --> 00:14:23.418
need to be able to
flow with the clothes.

00:14:23.418 --> 00:14:25.137
And how has that
influenced your life?

00:14:25.137 --> 00:14:27.470
LUBOC AZRIA: Well, I think
as a dancer, one thing that I

00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:28.640
learned is discipline.

00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:31.070
I think you have to be really
disciplined as a dancer

00:14:31.070 --> 00:14:32.620
and you have to be
very consistent.

00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:36.230
And the other thing I learned
how a woman's body moves.

00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:39.590
So I actually fit every
single garment in BCBG.

00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:42.460
There's nothing that leaves,
except for BCBCGeneration,

00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:45.910
but BCBGMAXAZRIA, or Herve
Leger, the Runway line,

00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:49.720
I actually physically
fit it on our fit model.

00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:51.600
And I go over all the details.

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:53.550
And I actually put it
on myself, as well.

00:14:53.550 --> 00:14:55.050
Because I want to
know how it feels.

00:14:55.050 --> 00:14:57.220
Because I believe that
if you need alterations,

00:14:57.220 --> 00:14:59.630
then-- most women think
that there's something

00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:00.790
wrong with their bodies.

00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:02.040
There's nothing
wrong with your body.

00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:03.060
Your body is beautiful.

00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:06.690
There's something wrong
with the fit of the clothes.

00:15:06.690 --> 00:15:11.169
There's amazing brands out
there that have great quality

00:15:11.169 --> 00:15:11.960
and they look good.

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:14.110
But you put it on
and you look dumpy.

00:15:14.110 --> 00:15:17.390
And understanding proportions
I think is very important.

00:15:17.390 --> 00:15:20.900
Understanding textures,
fabric, colors is important.

00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:23.230
So when I'm actually in the
fitting room-- by the way,

00:15:23.230 --> 00:15:26.690
my fit model is not
somebody who's very young.

00:15:26.690 --> 00:15:28.310
She's actually in her 50s.

00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:32.280
And the reason why is you can
take a beautiful, young model

00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:34.150
and everything is going
to look good on her.

00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:37.210
But you take a
50-year-old model and you

00:15:37.210 --> 00:15:41.440
try to make her look amazing,
that's the difference.

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:43.520
And so I actually
do the opposite.

00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:46.940
I take something that I
think-- she's beautiful anyway.

00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:51.290
But it's just more of
appreciating what happens

00:15:51.290 --> 00:15:53.250
and where you need a lift.

00:15:53.250 --> 00:15:55.290
LISA LEE: And in terms
of comfort-- I mean,

00:15:55.290 --> 00:15:56.960
I think that's one
of the challenges.

00:15:56.960 --> 00:16:00.090
Like, I know for myself,
wearing heels, it looks great.

00:16:00.090 --> 00:16:01.530
I'd love to wear them every day.

00:16:01.530 --> 00:16:03.339
But it just doesn't
seem that comfortable.

00:16:03.339 --> 00:16:04.130
LUBOC AZRIA: Right.

00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:07.670
LISA LEE: What's your
recommendation for balancing

00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:09.412
practicality with style?

00:16:09.412 --> 00:16:11.120
LUBOC AZRIA: I think
it's the same thing.

00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:13.920
I think have a pair of shoes
with the heels in your bag.

00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:17.930
I mean, right now bags
looks suitcases anyway.

00:16:17.930 --> 00:16:20.760
I just think it's important--
like if you're in a meeting,

00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:22.260
it's nice to wear a heel.

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:23.960
You're sitting down anyway.

00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:25.670
If you're running
around, obviously it's

00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:27.503
better to wear something
that's comfortable.

00:16:27.503 --> 00:16:28.830
I mean I run a marathon.

00:16:28.830 --> 00:16:31.118
So my feet grow a half
a size every time I run.

00:16:31.118 --> 00:16:32.118
It's getting ridiculous.

00:16:35.190 --> 00:16:36.860
Anyway, I like comfortable.

00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:39.510
I always have either flip-flops
or something in my bag,

00:16:39.510 --> 00:16:41.207
just so that I can relieve pain.

00:16:41.207 --> 00:16:43.290
But I have to tell you,
technology, let's talk it.

00:16:43.290 --> 00:16:45.420
You guys are in the head
of technology, right?

00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:49.490
Why can't we get little
massage pads inside the shoes

00:16:49.490 --> 00:16:50.491
so you can just plug-in?

00:16:50.491 --> 00:16:51.990
So when you're
sitting there, you're

00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:53.130
actually getting a massage.

00:16:53.130 --> 00:16:53.900
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:56.020
I want to buy remote
control luggage.

00:16:56.020 --> 00:16:58.620
Can we talk about
when you're traveling?

00:16:58.620 --> 00:16:59.930
There's remote control cars.

00:16:59.930 --> 00:17:01.944
Why isn't there a
luggage remote control?

00:17:01.944 --> 00:17:02.860
LISA LEE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:03.970
LUBOC AZRIA: Yeah.

00:17:03.970 --> 00:17:07.010
You just go, right?

00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:07.839
I'm serious.

00:17:07.839 --> 00:17:09.630
There's so much to invent.

00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:11.270
I was sitting and
having a conversation

00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:12.010
with someone yesterday.

00:17:12.010 --> 00:17:14.468
And they were talking about
all this technology for clothes

00:17:14.468 --> 00:17:16.930
and your clothes can
light up in the dark.

00:17:16.930 --> 00:17:20.730
And I thought, well, OK.

00:17:20.730 --> 00:17:24.230
If you have a purpose for
that, I think it's important.

00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:28.590
But there's so much innovation
in textiles right now.

00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:30.260
There's fabrics that
make you feel good.

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:32.700
They have a little bit of
copper in it and something else.

00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:34.950
I mean there's so
much innovation.

00:17:34.950 --> 00:17:36.120
It's very exciting.

00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:38.560
Because the clothes are supposed
to protect you, and make

00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:42.570
you feel beautiful, and
make you feel comfortable.

00:17:42.570 --> 00:17:44.710
But not everywhere do you
want to be comfortable.

00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:46.126
Remember, the
moment you're really

00:17:46.126 --> 00:17:49.600
comfortable that means
that you're not living,

00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:50.340
you're existing.

00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:53.052
Like, it's nice to be a little
bit uncomfortable in everything

00:17:53.052 --> 00:17:54.760
because that's how
you're moving forward.

00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:56.156
Think about it.

00:17:56.156 --> 00:17:57.530
If you're too
comfortable, you're

00:17:57.530 --> 00:17:59.860
not probably producing what
you could be producing.

00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:01.210
If you have a little
discomfort-- like,

00:18:01.210 --> 00:18:02.751
I'm always looking
at the collection.

00:18:02.751 --> 00:18:05.500
And if it's too
perfect, I'm like, no.

00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:08.030
Something is really
wrong with that.

00:18:08.030 --> 00:18:10.000
LISA LEE: It's motto we
live by here at Google.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.620
Always try things that are-- or
always uncomfortably excited.

00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:14.940
LUBOC AZRIA: Absolutely.

00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:20.590
I think that's how you live,
and you grow, and you evolve.

00:18:20.590 --> 00:18:22.573
Complacency doesn't
get you anywhere.

00:18:22.573 --> 00:18:23.420
LISA LEE: Right.

00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:25.600
So talking about technology,
I'd love to ask you,

00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:28.840
do you have a favorite
Google product?

00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:30.000
LUBOC AZRIA: Yes.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.340
Google Image Search,
can't live without it.

00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:35.570
Yes.

00:18:35.570 --> 00:18:36.330
Absolutely.

00:18:36.330 --> 00:18:38.200
LISA LEE: And how do you use it
and how does it influence you?

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:40.530
LUBOC AZRIA: Every day, I
just literally with research

00:18:40.530 --> 00:18:41.090
for images.

00:18:41.090 --> 00:18:43.520
I remember we used
to go to libraries

00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:47.640
and sign the books out, and
bring them, and then copy them,

00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:49.150
and then put them in folders.

00:18:49.150 --> 00:18:51.761
I mean I don't
throw away anything.

00:18:51.761 --> 00:18:54.220
It's a really bad idea.

00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:56.130
And so now, it's amazing.

00:18:56.130 --> 00:18:59.880
You can just really find
anything, save it, use it,

00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:00.457
print it out.

00:19:00.457 --> 00:19:02.790
I mean we will make the most
amazing inspiration boards.

00:19:02.790 --> 00:19:04.470
It's fantastic.

00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:05.610
LISA LEE: Yeah.

00:19:05.610 --> 00:19:07.350
And what about in
terms of social media?

00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:12.350
I mean I think there's
Twitter, there's Instagram,

00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:14.480
there's Google Social.

00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:17.700
How do you use that to
connect with your customers

00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:19.890
and to get to know them better?

00:19:19.890 --> 00:19:25.010
LUBOC AZRIA: Well, I remember
when we did our first runway

00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:30.820
show in 1996, in New York,
people didn't know who we were.

00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:33.110
And we were the first
contemporary company

00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:36.430
to show during the Fashion Week
in New York with designers.

00:19:36.430 --> 00:19:38.510
And I don't know if you
know the whole idea?

00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:41.010
Design is really a price point.

00:19:41.010 --> 00:19:41.940
That's all it is.

00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:43.780
Everything is designed.

00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:45.650
There's no product
that's made generically.

00:19:45.650 --> 00:19:48.210
Even a t-shirt, I think
t-shirts are the hardest things

00:19:48.210 --> 00:19:51.350
to fit anyway because you
need to get that fit right.

00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:55.270
Anyway, going back to--
so whoever reviewed us,

00:19:55.270 --> 00:19:56.840
defined us.

00:19:56.840 --> 00:19:58.700
And they put us
into a certain box.

00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:00.820
And there's nothing
we can do about it.

00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:02.890
Because at that time,
there was no social media

00:20:02.890 --> 00:20:04.980
to tell you a story,
to tell your message,

00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:08.030
to inspire, to
connect, to really

00:20:08.030 --> 00:20:10.900
make the consumer
or your audience

00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:14.830
understand you as a
company, your DNA.

00:20:14.830 --> 00:20:17.650
So I feel that social media
now, it is incredible.

00:20:17.650 --> 00:20:18.600
We tell our stories.

00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:19.680
We tell our passions.

00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:20.710
We connect.

00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:24.860
Whether it's Twitter, or
Pinterest, or Instagram,

00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:27.110
whatever it is, we're
telling stories.

00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:29.820
And they're curated because
it's our point of view.

00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:32.860
That's how we would
want to see things done.

00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:34.520
And I think you
see the aesthetics.

00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:36.100
You see our sensibility.

00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:37.130
You see your passion.

00:20:37.130 --> 00:20:39.130
You see our creativity.

00:20:39.130 --> 00:20:40.540
You see who we connect to.

00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:44.070
And that's unique to each brand.

00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:46.080
And I love that
everybody's on social.

00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:46.820
I really do.

00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:48.480
And I love the Twitter.

00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:50.660
I love that you
can send messages

00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:55.270
to the world about what
you're doing and connect.

00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:56.270
LISA LEE: That's great.

00:20:56.270 --> 00:21:01.460
And so how does that influence--
in terms of, like, design,

00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:04.140
like do you ever think
about, oh, someone's

00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:05.570
given me this great idea.

00:21:05.570 --> 00:21:05.960
LUBOC AZRIA: Absolutely.

00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:07.770
LISA LEE: And we need to move
sort of a different direction

00:21:07.770 --> 00:21:09.260
that what we were
originally thinking.

00:21:09.260 --> 00:21:09.980
Does that happen?

00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:10.730
LUBOC AZRIA: Yeah.

00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:17.710
So what usually happens is
that we get a suggestion

00:21:17.710 --> 00:21:18.790
and we meet people.

00:21:18.790 --> 00:21:22.190
I'm very big about meeting
people and understanding

00:21:22.190 --> 00:21:23.346
their needs.

00:21:23.346 --> 00:21:25.220
Because obviously, we
don't create everything

00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:26.100
for ourselves.

00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:27.380
But there is a definite need.

00:21:27.380 --> 00:21:31.190
So through social media
we have, we love our fans.

00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:34.980
Or we have a Week
of Chic or things

00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:37.590
that we do to really get
closer and understand

00:21:37.590 --> 00:21:41.010
what our fans like.

00:21:41.010 --> 00:21:44.480
And so I think in terms
of ideas, I don't know.

00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:47.250
We're so creative, too creative.

00:21:47.250 --> 00:21:50.920
We need to be more
operational, people.

00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:53.450
LISA LEE: And what are some
of the latest inspirations?

00:21:53.450 --> 00:21:54.700
LUBOC AZRIA: I've got so many.

00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:56.908
LISA LEE: You know, kind of
come across some of them.

00:21:56.908 --> 00:21:59.220
Do you just wake up in the
morning thinking about them

00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:01.094
or as you're just walking
down the street you

00:22:01.094 --> 00:22:04.155
see things that spike interest?

00:22:04.155 --> 00:22:06.160
LUBOC AZRIA: Lisa, I
think it's everything.

00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:07.990
I think being here,
you never know.

00:22:07.990 --> 00:22:10.858
I might do some primary
colors [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:10.858 --> 00:22:12.280
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:13.230 --> 00:22:17.980
I think the idea is that
what you connect to.

00:22:17.980 --> 00:22:21.170
I think that art
is very important.

00:22:21.170 --> 00:22:24.080
Does any of you paint or draw?

00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:26.060
Self-expression,
how difficult it

00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:29.170
is when you actually step away
from it and put it on a wall.

00:22:29.170 --> 00:22:30.810
So I think art to
me is very personal.

00:22:30.810 --> 00:22:32.320
And what we connect
to is personal.

00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:33.450
So that's a huge influence.

00:22:33.450 --> 00:22:36.220
Travel is great.

00:22:36.220 --> 00:22:37.980
You know, textiles.

00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:40.190
People, I work with
the most creative,

00:22:40.190 --> 00:22:42.490
amazing, innovative people.

00:22:42.490 --> 00:22:43.850
And I'm obsessed with them.

00:22:43.850 --> 00:22:45.766
And most of the time,
they come up with ideas.

00:22:45.766 --> 00:22:48.290
And I'm just like,
oh, I'm not so sure.

00:22:48.290 --> 00:22:48.790
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:48.790 --> 00:22:51.770
And really, I love it.

00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:53.840
No, I think it's really
working with the team

00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:55.380
and really kind of connecting.

00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:58.490
And I think they bring a lot of
ideas and then we share ideas.

00:22:58.490 --> 00:23:02.530
My overall job is
not just to design,

00:23:02.530 --> 00:23:05.650
it's to really bring clarity.

00:23:05.650 --> 00:23:08.820
Because if we throw
everything against the wall

00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:11.550
and see what sticks,
it takes too long.

00:23:11.550 --> 00:23:15.010
I'm almost like, I
edit a point of view

00:23:15.010 --> 00:23:17.990
to make sure that-- it's
one thing being creative.

00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:19.790
It's another thing
being successful.

00:23:19.790 --> 00:23:21.510
We create for a woman.

00:23:21.510 --> 00:23:23.920
And we want her
to feel beautiful.

00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:27.220
And obviously, we're not
going to do three sleeves

00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:30.170
or we're not going to make
her look like a clown.

00:23:30.170 --> 00:23:34.960
And I always want a woman
to look a certain way.

00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:37.420
A woman always wants
to look taller,

00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:39.625
and slimmer, and more elegant.

00:23:39.625 --> 00:23:41.000
LISA LEE: It sounds
like you work

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:42.520
with a lot of
inspirational women.

00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:43.345
LUBOC AZRIA: I do.

00:23:43.345 --> 00:23:46.600
LISA LEE: And so for yourself,
you've become very successful.

00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:48.920
Any advice you'd give to
the women in the audience

00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:51.490
about becoming a leader in your
space, and sort of the path

00:23:51.490 --> 00:23:55.220
that you took, and
the characteristics I

00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:57.590
think that you find most
important in leaders?

00:23:57.590 --> 00:23:58.590
LUBOC AZRIA: Absolutely.

00:23:58.590 --> 00:24:01.580
I think we need to
define what success is.

00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:05.190
Success to me is
doing what you love,

00:24:05.190 --> 00:24:08.300
and having passion, and living
your life so that you're

00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:09.720
exhaustive about passion.

00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:12.360
That to me, is truly success.

00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:13.820
In terms of being
a leader, I think

00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:15.430
it's surrounding
yourself with people

00:24:15.430 --> 00:24:17.654
who are better than you are.

00:24:17.654 --> 00:24:19.445
That takes strength
and that takes courage.

00:24:21.990 --> 00:24:23.940
People are everything.

00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:25.214
We work in a community.

00:24:25.214 --> 00:24:26.880
And you really have
to surround yourself

00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:28.338
with people who
bring out the best.

00:24:28.338 --> 00:24:30.954
And in terms of leadership,
live by example.

00:24:30.954 --> 00:24:33.370
If you challenge somebody,
they have to do that, make sure

00:24:33.370 --> 00:24:34.980
you can do it as well.

00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:36.650
And I think that's important.

00:24:36.650 --> 00:24:39.460
People don't work for a company.

00:24:39.460 --> 00:24:42.280
People work for other people.

00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:45.220
And I think it's important as
a leader to be true to that,

00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:50.170
to be honest, to
lead by example,

00:24:50.170 --> 00:24:54.180
and collaborate with people,
give people opportunities.

00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:56.750
I think that's so important.

00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:59.160
And I have just a quote.

00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:02.030
I have this amazing quote
for all of you females,

00:25:02.030 --> 00:25:03.990
by Madeleine Albright.

00:25:03.990 --> 00:25:08.670
Because she said, "Women
who do not help other women

00:25:08.670 --> 00:25:11.164
have a special place in hell."

00:25:11.164 --> 00:25:12.480
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:16.820
And the reason why she said that
is because a majority of women,

00:25:16.820 --> 00:25:20.520
they are not CEOs, or CFOs
or at the top of the-- I

00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:23.970
call it the food chain-- is
because other woman sabotaged

00:25:23.970 --> 00:25:26.780
them, not men.

00:25:26.780 --> 00:25:28.110
Women sabotage women.

00:25:28.110 --> 00:25:32.730
So if we stop doing that, there
will be more leaders out there.

00:25:32.730 --> 00:25:35.620
And our goal-- I mean
we have a whole program.

00:25:35.620 --> 00:25:38.430
It's called Contributor
Program, that I

00:25:38.430 --> 00:25:39.710
think is extremely important.

00:25:39.710 --> 00:25:42.500
So it takes women that
perhaps are not in the news,

00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:47.087
or women who are just incredible
leaders in their own rights.

00:25:47.087 --> 00:25:47.920
I wrote their names.

00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:51.100
It was Padma Warrior, who
is with Cisco Systems.

00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:53.350
She is beyond amazing.

00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:55.510
She was one of our
first contributors.

00:25:55.510 --> 00:25:58.970
And I loved her strength,
her passion, her vision,

00:25:58.970 --> 00:26:01.480
and how she made it
to the top with just

00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:02.580
caring about other people.

00:26:02.580 --> 00:26:03.913
She never thought about herself.

00:26:03.913 --> 00:26:06.180
Do you know what I'm saying,
always doing by example.

00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:09.230
I have another female, Claire
Rothman, who is amazing.

00:26:09.230 --> 00:26:12.870
She is 86 years old.

00:26:12.870 --> 00:26:15.570
She was the head of
Forum, an amazing woman,

00:26:15.570 --> 00:26:16.710
and how they did it.

00:26:16.710 --> 00:26:19.430
And they did it through
recognizing other women,

00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:23.690
never stabbing anybody in
the back, caring for people,

00:26:23.690 --> 00:26:25.260
understanding,
following through.

00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:26.780
And I think that's
true leadership.

00:26:26.780 --> 00:26:30.244
And so on in this Contributor
Program that we're doing,

00:26:30.244 --> 00:26:31.660
there's videos
that you can watch.

00:26:31.660 --> 00:26:34.710
But they're just amazing
women, who just simple.

00:26:34.710 --> 00:26:36.234
It's not about
being complicated.

00:26:36.234 --> 00:26:37.900
LISA LEE: It's about
knowing who you are

00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:39.220
and being true to
yourself, it sounds like.

00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:40.230
LUBOC AZRIA: Absolutely.

00:26:40.230 --> 00:26:41.510
LISA LEE: That's great.

00:26:41.510 --> 00:26:45.010
I wanted to make sure we had
time to run the runway show.

00:26:45.010 --> 00:26:45.760
LUBOC AZRIA: Yeah.

00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:46.000
Yeah.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:46.630
LISA LEE: And make
sure that you can

00:26:46.630 --> 00:26:48.010
get some commentary on that.

00:26:48.010 --> 00:26:49.670
LUBOC AZRIA: Great.

00:26:49.670 --> 00:26:53.777
LISA LEE: Anything you can
give us in terms of ideas?

00:26:53.777 --> 00:26:55.860
What are your favorite
pieces in this runway show?

00:26:55.860 --> 00:26:56.640
LUBOC AZRIA: Oh, sure.

00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:56.940
OK.

00:26:56.940 --> 00:26:58.390
So let me tell you
the inspiration,

00:26:58.390 --> 00:26:59.440
so you kind of get an idea.

00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:00.856
And then I'll walk
you through it.

00:27:00.856 --> 00:27:02.810
So basically the
inspiration started

00:27:02.810 --> 00:27:05.890
is, I was in New
York City, where

00:27:05.890 --> 00:27:07.800
the runway shows are basically.

00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:12.464
So I was at ABC Carpets, which
is one of my favorite stores.

00:27:12.464 --> 00:27:14.380
If you're ever in New
York, you have to visit.

00:27:14.380 --> 00:27:17.450
But it's basically furniture,
carpets, accessory, everything.

00:27:17.450 --> 00:27:19.470
And it's curated in
such a beautiful way.

00:27:19.470 --> 00:27:20.760
I was so inspired.

00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:22.470
And so I went to
the fifth floor.

00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:26.010
And there's amazing rugs.

00:27:26.010 --> 00:27:30.530
They're either rugs done from
Eastern Europe, Persia, Turkey,

00:27:30.530 --> 00:27:32.380
all over the world basically.

00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:34.970
And what they do is
they take-- and they're

00:27:34.970 --> 00:27:36.920
the most gorgeous
colors you've ever seen.

00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:39.010
And they look familiar.

00:27:39.010 --> 00:27:42.210
They look like the
are traditional rugs.

00:27:42.210 --> 00:27:43.420
But they're are not.

00:27:43.420 --> 00:27:45.950
And I was so impressed
with the process.

00:27:45.950 --> 00:27:47.990
So I googled it.

00:27:47.990 --> 00:27:50.370
And it's called Color Reform.

00:27:50.370 --> 00:27:53.195
And what they do is they take
carpets that are damaged.

00:27:53.195 --> 00:27:55.830
So carpets that perhaps are
not so great or carpets that

00:27:55.830 --> 00:27:57.660
didn't make it to "A grade."

00:27:57.660 --> 00:28:00.770
And they bleach them,
dry them in the sun,

00:28:00.770 --> 00:28:02.040
and they redye them.

00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:04.290
And each carpet
is one of a kind.

00:28:04.290 --> 00:28:06.930
And I thought that
was so innovative.

00:28:06.930 --> 00:28:11.020
Anything, whether it's
in fashion or in tech,

00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:13.270
what makes a company
successful is passion, vision,

00:28:13.270 --> 00:28:14.780
and innovation.

00:28:14.780 --> 00:28:16.840
And they have done this
with these carpets,

00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:19.910
where each artist
puts passion into it.

00:28:19.910 --> 00:28:22.139
The innovation is
how they're done it.

00:28:22.139 --> 00:28:23.430
It's just such a great process.

00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:25.280
So anyway, I was
obsessed with it.

00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:29.340
So I took pictures, tons
of pictures of the carpets.

00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:32.490
And the prints that
you're going to see here

00:28:32.490 --> 00:28:35.650
are actually done
from the carpet kind

00:28:35.650 --> 00:28:36.860
of pictures and inspiration.

00:28:36.860 --> 00:28:38.600
So we did graphic
design, obviously,

00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:40.450
and printed it on silk.

00:28:40.450 --> 00:28:44.640
And then the other inspiration
was we're in California.

00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:47.270
So it's about sort
of bohemian spirit.

00:28:47.270 --> 00:28:49.070
It's about women--
like, I wanted

00:28:49.070 --> 00:28:52.800
her to just feel so
beautiful, elegant, and airy.

00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:57.030
And I just wanted that
bohemian side to come through.

00:28:57.030 --> 00:28:59.100
And then on the third
note, my daughter

00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:03.360
just got married,
actually last week.

00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:06.510
So it was such a beautiful
event, I have to tell you.

00:29:06.510 --> 00:29:08.250
She was she was stunning.

00:29:08.250 --> 00:29:13.800
And, yeah, it was
quite emotional.

00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:16.220
So when we were working
on this collection,

00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:18.400
I kept on thinking
so this is everybody

00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:20.344
that's walking down the aisle.

00:29:20.344 --> 00:29:21.180
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:22.870
The whole party,
this is how I want.

00:29:22.870 --> 00:29:24.230
That's the finale that
you're going to see.

00:29:24.230 --> 00:29:25.710
But that's how I want everybody.

00:29:25.710 --> 00:29:27.140
Of course, that's not
what ended up happening.

00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:27.700
LISA LEE: I have to
say, how much does she

00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:28.660
let you influence her?

00:29:28.660 --> 00:29:33.260
LUBOC AZRIA: Remember, in
life, it's not what you want.

00:29:33.260 --> 00:29:36.360
It's what you get.

00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:37.800
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:29:38.165 --> 00:29:38.790
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:29:38.790 --> 00:29:42.170
So, very important, when we do
shows, the first five models,

00:29:42.170 --> 00:29:45.520
this is their first show ever,
meaning they don't-- I want

00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:49.300
to promote young women here.

00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:50.830
So this is just
really beautiful.

00:29:50.830 --> 00:29:53.060
So we have a little bit
of this kind of strength.

00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:57.980
The belt that they're wearing,
which is like a karate belt,

00:29:57.980 --> 00:30:00.400
that that with everything
being very feminine,

00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:02.410
it's nice to give
it that strength.

00:30:02.410 --> 00:30:05.470
In fashion, you need
opposite things.

00:30:05.470 --> 00:30:08.730
If something is very fragile,
give it something hard.

00:30:08.730 --> 00:30:11.950
That's what makes
it contemporary.

00:30:11.950 --> 00:30:14.450
So that's actually--
well, where's the dress?

00:30:14.450 --> 00:30:18.010
This is a perfect jumper,
until you turn around.

00:30:21.450 --> 00:30:23.290
There you go.

00:30:23.290 --> 00:30:28.040
So this is your swimming
jumper actually.

00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:30.940
So do you see a little
peek where her shirt is?

00:30:30.940 --> 00:30:32.820
That's a little
bit of the carpet,

00:30:32.820 --> 00:30:34.320
kind of feel, the design.

00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:36.740
They're actually
quite beautiful.

00:30:36.740 --> 00:30:38.940
And I love all the
trapunto stitching

00:30:38.940 --> 00:30:40.613
which is done on this jacket.

00:30:44.780 --> 00:30:46.715
Now, do you know why
models don't smile?

00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:52.450
Because you're modeling clothes.

00:30:52.450 --> 00:30:53.660
You're like a hanger.

00:30:53.660 --> 00:30:55.950
So if they smile,
you smile, then

00:30:55.950 --> 00:30:59.220
your attention
goes off somewhere.

00:30:59.220 --> 00:31:01.720
And also, they walk
kind of interesting.

00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:03.200
They walk like
this a little bit.

00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:05.366
And the reason why is sol
the clothes don't wrinkle.

00:31:12.390 --> 00:31:15.170
And I love the
idea of versatility

00:31:15.170 --> 00:31:19.162
and just having the
vest being versatile.

00:31:19.162 --> 00:31:20.120
They're all reversible.

00:31:28.230 --> 00:31:29.480
Now, where is she going, guys?

00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:30.102
Come on.

00:31:33.270 --> 00:31:35.505
I say to Starbucks.

00:31:35.505 --> 00:31:36.990
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:42.070
I dare one of you to wear
this to the corporate meeting.

00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:44.070
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:44.070 --> 00:31:47.033
In real life, it's
a little higher.

00:31:47.033 --> 00:31:49.871
Yeah.

00:31:49.871 --> 00:31:52.320
Can you imagine.

00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:53.590
I'm sure you'll get attention.

00:31:53.590 --> 00:31:55.697
They'll ask you.

00:31:55.697 --> 00:31:57.280
But that's what it's
all about, right?

00:31:57.280 --> 00:31:59.140
Great clothes open all doors.

00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:09.250
I also think that there's
something really beautiful

00:32:09.250 --> 00:32:11.320
about surprises.

00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:13.630
Like when a woman comes
towards you, you're looking.

00:32:13.630 --> 00:32:18.120
Most of us try to-- or men--
try to look at their face.

00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:24.080
But when they turn around,
there's always something.

00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:25.950
So I believe that
the back sometimes is

00:32:25.950 --> 00:32:27.960
more important than the front.

00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:31.829
Because as they're walking
away, everybody's looking.

00:32:31.829 --> 00:32:32.328
Yeah.

00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:36.030
I love these models.

00:32:36.030 --> 00:32:37.790
They're so tall and
so uncomfortable

00:32:37.790 --> 00:32:39.380
with their bodies.

00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:40.130
You should see it.

00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:41.340
It's so funny.

00:32:41.340 --> 00:32:42.870
There's a little
thing that they do.

00:32:42.870 --> 00:32:45.670
So I fix them before
they come out.

00:32:45.670 --> 00:32:46.900
So I'm like, you know, like.

00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:49.400
And there's so much
static spray in the back.

00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:49.900
Oh.

00:32:49.900 --> 00:32:51.982
So you're just like
spraying and you're fixing,

00:32:51.982 --> 00:32:52.940
and you're making sure.

00:32:52.940 --> 00:32:54.689
And they're like
standing there like this.

00:32:54.689 --> 00:32:57.080
They're 17 years old, 18, 19.

00:32:57.080 --> 00:33:00.471
Half of them don't speak
English, which is fantastic.

00:33:00.471 --> 00:33:02.261
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:02.597 --> 00:33:03.930
And they're just standing there.

00:33:03.930 --> 00:33:06.250
And then once the light
hits them, they're like,

00:33:06.250 --> 00:33:07.020
this is done.

00:33:07.020 --> 00:33:07.660
It's all done.

00:33:07.660 --> 00:33:07.980
It's nothing.

00:33:07.980 --> 00:33:09.355
When the light
hits them, they're

00:33:09.355 --> 00:33:13.000
like-- it's like you're
seeing them appear.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:14.231
It's so crazy.

00:33:16.767 --> 00:33:17.475
This is gorgeous.

00:33:23.980 --> 00:33:26.800
And so this is actually,
again, from the carpets.

00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:30.380
They're like, ah.

00:33:30.380 --> 00:33:32.840
This woman, her name is Mijo.

00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:33.950
And she's amazing.

00:33:33.950 --> 00:33:35.690
She's from Macedonia.

00:33:35.690 --> 00:33:38.880
Do you guys even know
where that is on the map?

00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:41.750
Google it.

00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:44.410
But it used to be were
Alexander the Great came.

00:33:44.410 --> 00:33:46.467
That country used
to rule the world.

00:34:02.500 --> 00:34:04.320
And again, they're
just effortless pieces.

00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:05.680
You just put them on and go.

00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:07.570
You can put a denim
jacket over it.

00:34:07.570 --> 00:34:09.070
You can put heavy boots with it.

00:34:09.070 --> 00:34:09.989
It's how you wear it.

00:34:09.989 --> 00:34:12.050
I always feel like
you should dance

00:34:12.050 --> 00:34:13.260
in the rain in your clothes.

00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:16.461
And if you can't dance
in the rain then--

00:34:16.461 --> 00:34:18.210
did you ever want to
put a beautiful dress

00:34:18.210 --> 00:34:20.440
and just go swimming in it?

00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:22.738
Do it.

00:34:22.738 --> 00:34:24.196
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:26.630 --> 00:34:29.179
And by the way, we have
to-- so the runway shows,

00:34:29.179 --> 00:34:30.690
the garments actually are fixed.

00:34:30.690 --> 00:34:34.260
But we can't really
have everything open.

00:34:34.260 --> 00:34:39.670
Down the runway, you need to get
that wow feeling for editors.

00:34:39.670 --> 00:34:42.010
So you don't line the
dresses most of the time.

00:34:42.010 --> 00:34:45.610
And you leave things a
little bit more open.

00:34:45.610 --> 00:34:52.960
But in real life,
it's much more safe.

00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:53.460
Yeah.

00:34:53.460 --> 00:34:54.460
She's gorgeous.

00:35:01.114 --> 00:35:03.280
LISA LEE: I love how you
carry the theme of the belt

00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:03.890
throughout too.

00:35:03.890 --> 00:35:04.639
LUBOC AZRIA: Yeah.

00:35:04.639 --> 00:35:06.630
LISA LEE: It adds that strength.

00:35:06.630 --> 00:35:08.272
LUBOC AZRIA: It's great.

00:35:08.272 --> 00:35:09.980
This collection is so
interesting because

00:35:09.980 --> 00:35:13.570
from the beginning, from
the first piece to the time

00:35:13.570 --> 00:35:17.330
that it actually makes it to the
store, I see it like 30 times.

00:35:17.330 --> 00:35:19.270
And I know when
something is good is

00:35:19.270 --> 00:35:21.550
when I'm not tired of it.

00:35:21.550 --> 00:35:25.610
Like, I'm still excited to
go then and actually wear it.

00:35:25.610 --> 00:35:28.055
And that to me is when the
collection really resonates.

00:35:31.060 --> 00:35:33.350
And this is all
like handkerchiefs,

00:35:33.350 --> 00:35:36.580
all done in chiffon, which
is just cascading down.

00:35:36.580 --> 00:35:37.906
And this I just love.

00:35:41.980 --> 00:35:44.030
And see how the
girls are tougher?

00:35:44.030 --> 00:35:47.180
The more feminine the clothes
are, the tougher for the girls

00:35:47.180 --> 00:35:48.956
are.

00:35:48.956 --> 00:35:50.636
I like that.

00:35:50.636 --> 00:35:51.612
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:52.590 --> 00:35:56.320
There's no story behind this.

00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:59.319
And see how beautiful she is,
but the clothes is then tied?

00:35:59.319 --> 00:36:00.360
Because she's too pretty.

00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:04.134
You put her in this sweet
dress and it just doesn't work.

00:36:04.134 --> 00:36:06.038
[MUSIC AND SINGING]

00:36:06.990 --> 00:36:08.950
This should be
everybody's wedding song.

00:36:12.450 --> 00:36:12.950
Um.

00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:19.070
So that was going to be
my outfit for the wedding.

00:36:19.070 --> 00:36:22.005
But you can't wear white.

00:36:22.005 --> 00:36:24.480
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:25.724
But that's a perfect bride.

00:36:25.724 --> 00:36:26.390
Isn't that cool?

00:36:26.390 --> 00:36:27.431
Can you imagine somebody?

00:36:27.431 --> 00:36:28.980
That's like, yummy.

00:36:51.660 --> 00:36:53.590
And, obviously, I love jackets.

00:36:53.590 --> 00:36:56.660
So I was saying,
Monica and I today

00:36:56.660 --> 00:37:00.730
will look like we're
from the rock band.

00:37:00.730 --> 00:37:02.740
And this is so pretty.

00:37:02.740 --> 00:37:04.680
That's also like an
amazing wedding dress.

00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:08.320
But, of course, my daughter
decided to wear something else.

00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:10.320
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:16.050 --> 00:37:17.860
And that's all
handkerchiefs, too.

00:37:34.510 --> 00:37:36.800
Again, they're not
that low in real life.

00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:41.580
And this is my angel dress.

00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:43.170
Those are wings.

00:37:43.170 --> 00:37:44.868
I thought if you
ever want to fly.

00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:54.730
And one of my good friends,
Bo, just wore this to a premier

00:37:54.730 --> 00:37:55.290
in New York.

00:37:55.290 --> 00:37:56.500
But she's so beautiful.

00:37:56.500 --> 00:37:58.690
Again, you don't need
to show that much skin.

00:37:58.690 --> 00:38:02.135
It's about sort of
the flow of things.

00:38:09.070 --> 00:38:09.825
She's so nervous.

00:38:33.380 --> 00:38:36.120
Now, don't forget that this
is the first show in New York

00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:37.490
Fashion Week.

00:38:37.490 --> 00:38:40.649
But this opens up New
York Fashion Week.

00:38:40.649 --> 00:38:41.940
And we had like people weeping.

00:38:44.850 --> 00:38:45.810
And it's 10:00 AM.

00:38:45.810 --> 00:38:48.660
So people probably didn't have
enough coffee or maybe too

00:38:48.660 --> 00:38:50.340
much coffee.

00:38:50.340 --> 00:38:54.410
They're going through
some emotional--

00:38:54.410 --> 00:38:56.590
so that was going
to be my dress.

00:38:56.590 --> 00:39:04.940
And then for the wedding, but it
wasn't about me at the wedding.

00:39:04.940 --> 00:39:06.416
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:11.543
Although, I imagined
that it was going to be.

00:39:13.996 --> 00:39:15.370
Again, have fun
with the clothes.

00:39:15.370 --> 00:39:16.080
LISA LEE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:16.590
LUBOC AZRIA: Just enjoy it.

00:39:16.590 --> 00:39:17.520
It's so much fun.

00:39:59.385 --> 00:40:00.410
It's so funny.

00:40:00.410 --> 00:40:02.370
We asked the model, so
what do you think when

00:40:02.370 --> 00:40:03.934
you're going down the runway?

00:40:03.934 --> 00:40:04.850
What are you thinking?

00:40:04.850 --> 00:40:09.000
She's like, pizza,
where am I going

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:13.150
to get my nails done, where
do I-- I'm like, really?

00:40:16.510 --> 00:40:17.680
Pizza, I know.

00:40:28.350 --> 00:40:29.805
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:30.780 --> 00:40:31.750
And that's my pookie.

00:40:31.750 --> 00:40:35.180
That's by husband.

00:40:35.180 --> 00:40:35.960
[END PLAYBACK]

00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:39.340
Now, he's my muse.

00:40:39.340 --> 00:40:40.269
I know.

00:40:40.269 --> 00:40:42.560
LISA LEE: Thank you so much
for the commentary on that.

00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:45.790
I mean it definitely, I think,
sheds a different viewpoint.

00:40:45.790 --> 00:40:48.800
And just analyzing it, so you're
not just seeing the clothes

00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:51.610
and how beautiful they
are, but the contrast.

00:40:51.610 --> 00:40:54.490
The belt, the lines, how
they're very simple, but strong.

00:40:54.490 --> 00:40:57.220
And yet, you've got the flowy
component of the chiffon.

00:40:57.220 --> 00:40:58.400
So congratulations.

00:40:58.400 --> 00:40:58.970
LUBOC AZRIA: Thank you.

00:40:58.970 --> 00:41:01.345
LISA LEE: I think we're all
excited that it's the weekend

00:41:01.345 --> 00:41:03.912
and we can go shopping.

00:41:03.912 --> 00:41:06.120
I wanted to make sure we
left some time for questions

00:41:06.120 --> 00:41:08.950
from the audience, if
anybody has any for Luboc?

00:41:08.950 --> 00:41:11.280
AUDIENCE: Since you
joined the company in 1991

00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:16.267
and it have been to 2015 now,
has the vision for the company

00:41:16.267 --> 00:41:19.130
kind of changed?

00:41:19.130 --> 00:41:22.816
And how are you actually
contributing to driving it?

00:41:22.816 --> 00:41:27.684
And what's your corporate
story, a little bit?

00:41:27.684 --> 00:41:28.850
LUBOC AZRIA: It has changed.

00:41:28.850 --> 00:41:29.849
Well, it hasn't changed.

00:41:29.849 --> 00:41:30.930
It has evolved.

00:41:30.930 --> 00:41:36.060
I think that in the beginning,
the difference between BCBG

00:41:36.060 --> 00:41:38.740
and another company,
it is design-driven.

00:41:38.740 --> 00:41:40.490
It's not merchant-driven.

00:41:40.490 --> 00:41:42.320
Do you guys know the
difference between it?

00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:47.350
So merchant-driven, it is like
a GAP, or Banana Republic,

00:41:47.350 --> 00:41:50.640
or companies that sort of
produce based on the new units.

00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:54.570
Like, it's a little bit
more-- it's different.

00:41:54.570 --> 00:41:56.180
Design, we're design-driven.

00:41:56.180 --> 00:42:00.010
So basically we create
things that we want to wear.

00:42:00.010 --> 00:42:02.330
So it's very different.

00:42:02.330 --> 00:42:07.084
So with the times-- and we've
seen economically what happens.

00:42:07.084 --> 00:42:08.250
Do you know what I'm saying?

00:42:08.250 --> 00:42:11.730
So you have to always change
and evolve a little bit.

00:42:11.730 --> 00:42:14.290
At one point, we
had 20 divisions.

00:42:14.290 --> 00:42:16.910
Then we went to,
like, six divisions.

00:42:16.910 --> 00:42:19.170
So you're constantly
trying different things.

00:42:19.170 --> 00:42:21.920
When we originally
started BCBG-- well,

00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:24.590
Max started BCBG,
let me clarify this.

00:42:24.590 --> 00:42:27.250
He started BCBG in 1989.

00:42:27.250 --> 00:42:31.200
When I joined the company
in 1991, Max at the time

00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:32.440
was doing item business.

00:42:32.440 --> 00:42:34.450
He was doing pleated
skirts, stirrup pants.

00:42:34.450 --> 00:42:36.120
He wasn't doing collections.

00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:38.250
When I joined the
company, I realized

00:42:38.250 --> 00:42:39.570
that there's a huge void.

00:42:39.570 --> 00:42:43.710
At that time, there was
either Donna Karan at the top

00:42:43.710 --> 00:42:46.790
or there was Casual Corner.

00:42:46.790 --> 00:42:48.470
There was nothing in between.

00:42:48.470 --> 00:42:51.340
I mean you had a white
space that was so-- I

00:42:51.340 --> 00:42:55.420
didn't understand how you cannot
make clothes in the between

00:42:55.420 --> 00:42:56.060
range.

00:42:56.060 --> 00:42:59.550
So we were one of the first
contemporary companies,

00:42:59.550 --> 00:43:02.710
basically in America, to
create that type of fashion.

00:43:02.710 --> 00:43:06.650
With time, more people started
going in that territory.

00:43:06.650 --> 00:43:10.950
So you had to kind of
decide which other places.

00:43:10.950 --> 00:43:13.540
You're constantly
looking for voids.

00:43:13.540 --> 00:43:17.590
And once you realize that a
woman dresses based on her body

00:43:17.590 --> 00:43:19.610
shape, not based on
trends, you start

00:43:19.610 --> 00:43:22.040
creating clothes
that are versatile,

00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:25.020
that are right
for her lifestyle.

00:43:25.020 --> 00:43:26.440
So you kind of evolve it.

00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:29.590
So I don't believe in
one particular formula.

00:43:29.590 --> 00:43:32.550
I believe you are changing,
evolving, and growing.

00:43:32.550 --> 00:43:35.110
So with my position
in the company

00:43:35.110 --> 00:43:37.197
I think-- when I became
creative director.

00:43:37.197 --> 00:43:38.780
Now, I'm more involved
with marketing.

00:43:38.780 --> 00:43:40.946
So you have other departments
start reporting to you

00:43:40.946 --> 00:43:44.730
because your vision
is so direct.

00:43:44.730 --> 00:43:47.940
So one thing in fashion is you
don't want to be anybody else.

00:43:47.940 --> 00:43:49.910
Your DNA defines you.

00:43:49.910 --> 00:43:55.220
Like, for example, Herve
Leger has a very distinct DNA.

00:43:55.220 --> 00:43:58.910
And I'm not going to start
doing something for them

00:43:58.910 --> 00:44:01.610
that I think out that alignment.

00:44:01.610 --> 00:44:05.810
With BCBG as well, I
will not do-- like, I've

00:44:05.810 --> 00:44:07.383
been trying to do jeans though.

00:44:10.140 --> 00:44:13.150
But I will always stick to
making a woman feel and look

00:44:13.150 --> 00:44:13.910
beautiful.

00:44:13.910 --> 00:44:16.010
I will not make clothes
that sort of doesn't

00:44:16.010 --> 00:44:17.100
do that and evolve.

00:44:17.100 --> 00:44:18.840
But my position the
company has grown

00:44:18.840 --> 00:44:21.760
in terms of how many departments
report to me, which makes it

00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:24.940
very little time for me.

00:44:24.940 --> 00:44:26.614
LISA LEE: More demands.

00:44:26.614 --> 00:44:29.030
LUBOC AZRIA: Just a little.

00:44:29.030 --> 00:44:31.660
AUDIENCE: My question is more
on the career development side.

00:44:31.660 --> 00:44:33.800
So obviously, we
all work in tech.

00:44:33.800 --> 00:44:36.540
And it can be more of a
male-dominated industry.

00:44:36.540 --> 00:44:39.030
And so I'm wondering
what your experience is

00:44:39.030 --> 00:44:43.990
like as a female leader in
such a female-centric industry?

00:44:43.990 --> 00:44:48.020
And what that looks like as
you kind of rose in the ranks.

00:44:48.020 --> 00:44:51.520
And what that looks like now
as maybe a female community,

00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:54.380
where, like you were
saying, you're employing

00:44:54.380 --> 00:44:56.550
future female leaders?

00:44:56.550 --> 00:44:59.010
LUBOC AZRIA: Well, my
situation is very different.

00:44:59.010 --> 00:45:01.770
Don't forget that I
actually married Max.

00:45:01.770 --> 00:45:04.101
So I was already on
top of food chain.

00:45:04.101 --> 00:45:05.484
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:06.410 --> 00:45:11.970
But I have to say that I
really-- I wanted to learn.

00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:20.760
The one thing I've
learned is fashion

00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:23.610
is still very male dominated.

00:45:23.610 --> 00:45:26.600
The bankers, the real estate,
everything, it's very male

00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:27.100
dominated.

00:45:27.100 --> 00:45:36.770
I think what you need to do is
really be there, be honest, do

00:45:36.770 --> 00:45:39.590
more than you need to do.

00:45:39.590 --> 00:45:42.410
And I think it's being
present, communicate well.

00:45:42.410 --> 00:45:46.730
I mean men are very
simple creatures.

00:45:46.730 --> 00:45:49.460
And I'll explain to you
why they are simple.

00:45:49.460 --> 00:45:55.480
Because we bring men--
women create men.

00:45:55.480 --> 00:45:57.370
And we bring them up.

00:45:57.370 --> 00:45:59.880
And all they need
is significance.

00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:01.720
You tell them that
they look good,

00:46:01.720 --> 00:46:05.450
you tell them that they do well,
that the projects that they did

00:46:05.450 --> 00:46:06.360
were great.

00:46:06.360 --> 00:46:07.960
You align with them.

00:46:07.960 --> 00:46:09.915
And you see the
results happening.

00:46:09.915 --> 00:46:11.170
Do you know what I'm saying?

00:46:11.170 --> 00:46:17.900
Like I said, you just have to--
they're not your-- you just

00:46:17.900 --> 00:46:20.000
communicate well.

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:20.900
And that's it.

00:46:20.900 --> 00:46:21.800
You communicate well.

00:46:21.800 --> 00:46:23.370
You be open to their ideas.

00:46:23.370 --> 00:46:25.600
You show them your ideas.

00:46:25.600 --> 00:46:30.120
Before I was at BCBG, I
worked for a designer.

00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:35.150
And I remember leaving sketches
every single day on her desk.

00:46:35.150 --> 00:46:36.780
She didn't want any help.

00:46:36.780 --> 00:46:38.460
But I would leave
it just because I

00:46:38.460 --> 00:46:39.790
thought this was a great idea.

00:46:39.790 --> 00:46:42.910
This was a great
idea, maybe this.

00:46:42.910 --> 00:46:44.690
We like to see passion.

00:46:44.690 --> 00:46:46.640
We like to see people
who want to do more.

00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:47.670
We like to do that.

00:46:47.670 --> 00:46:51.000
And with that, you
can really grow.

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:53.850
Nowadays, I think
everybody is always

00:46:53.850 --> 00:46:56.880
looking for that next
talent, that next person

00:46:56.880 --> 00:46:58.660
with great ideas, innovation.

00:46:58.660 --> 00:47:01.390
And also put yourself
always-- if you think about

00:47:01.390 --> 00:47:04.160
me, me, me, me, you're
never going to get there.

00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:08.470
Like if I'm creating
clothes to make money,

00:47:08.470 --> 00:47:11.160
I will fail every single day.

00:47:11.160 --> 00:47:12.730
You have to have
a greater purpose.

00:47:12.730 --> 00:47:18.260
So if your purpose is to
get a higher level position,

00:47:18.260 --> 00:47:20.190
then you need to read
the job description.

00:47:20.190 --> 00:47:21.940
You guys don't have
job descriptions here.

00:47:21.940 --> 00:47:24.380
But you have to see what
that person is doing

00:47:24.380 --> 00:47:26.934
and what they're excelling at.

00:47:26.934 --> 00:47:28.100
Do you know what I'm saying?

00:47:28.100 --> 00:47:30.810
And then you see, can
I actually do that?

00:47:30.810 --> 00:47:33.610
We talked earlier about success.

00:47:33.610 --> 00:47:38.000
And it's very lonely at the top.

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:40.460
And if you're the
type of person that

00:47:40.460 --> 00:47:44.360
likes to connect with people,
collaborate, and be together,

00:47:44.360 --> 00:47:46.110
and the whole thing,
at the top sometimes,

00:47:46.110 --> 00:47:51.800
when you have to
make every decision--

00:47:51.800 --> 00:47:54.540
it's not always
right for everyone.

00:47:54.540 --> 00:47:56.420
I just want to just
put it out there.

00:47:56.420 --> 00:47:58.340
As a woman, we like
to collaborate.

00:47:58.340 --> 00:47:59.189
We like to share.

00:47:59.189 --> 00:48:00.480
We like to do different things.

00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:02.400
At the top, it's
kind of you have to--

00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:04.120
Like my husband, a
lot of times, he'll

00:48:04.120 --> 00:48:06.560
make decisions that I
totally disagree with.

00:48:06.560 --> 00:48:09.140
But I'll sit there and
I'll talk to him about it.

00:48:09.140 --> 00:48:12.640
I'll have him explain to me
why he made the decision so I

00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:16.190
can better support his vision.

00:48:16.190 --> 00:48:17.660
And that's what
makes a difference,

00:48:17.660 --> 00:48:19.570
not just saying, OK, I'll do it.

00:48:19.570 --> 00:48:20.070
No.

00:48:20.070 --> 00:48:20.950
Don't just do it.

00:48:20.950 --> 00:48:23.296
You understand the whole--
like the difference

00:48:23.296 --> 00:48:24.670
between, I think,
a lot of people

00:48:24.670 --> 00:48:27.290
who are at the higher
level, why they

00:48:27.290 --> 00:48:29.810
make perhaps a
smarter decision, it's

00:48:29.810 --> 00:48:31.030
not because they're smarter.

00:48:31.030 --> 00:48:33.554
It's because they
see the whole thing.

00:48:33.554 --> 00:48:35.720
So they know that this
person is already doing this,

00:48:35.720 --> 00:48:38.303
and this person is already doing
this, and this is doing this.

00:48:38.303 --> 00:48:40.400
So you can connect
the dots better.

00:48:40.400 --> 00:48:42.900
Where, if you are
only doing that,

00:48:42.900 --> 00:48:45.670
you can't see other parts.

00:48:45.670 --> 00:48:47.862
So I think in terms of
growing as a leader,

00:48:47.862 --> 00:48:49.570
I think you want to
make sure that you're

00:48:49.570 --> 00:48:55.550
supporting, learning, growing,
read more, educate yourself.

00:48:55.550 --> 00:48:58.680
In nature, anything
that doesn't grow, dies.

00:48:58.680 --> 00:49:01.465
Anything that doesn't
contribute, gets eliminated.

00:49:01.465 --> 00:49:03.090
LISA LEE: What I want
to hear from that

00:49:03.090 --> 00:49:05.660
is you're also leaning
on some of the skills

00:49:05.660 --> 00:49:09.480
that women are strong at,
collaboration, listening,

00:49:09.480 --> 00:49:12.100
and communication, and
pulling those ideas together.

00:49:12.100 --> 00:49:12.850
LUBOC AZRIA: Yeah.

00:49:12.850 --> 00:49:14.890
I mean if something goes
wrong, instead of saying, ah,

00:49:14.890 --> 00:49:15.473
it went wrong.

00:49:15.473 --> 00:49:19.540
You say, what can I do to
make a difference right now?

00:49:19.540 --> 00:49:23.060
What can I do to fix this now?

00:49:23.060 --> 00:49:26.300
Not just walking away and
saying, well, you know,

00:49:26.300 --> 00:49:26.860
it happened.

00:49:26.860 --> 00:49:27.400
No.

00:49:27.400 --> 00:49:27.967
It's not.

00:49:27.967 --> 00:49:29.050
You can make a difference.

00:49:29.050 --> 00:49:30.610
I mean at BCBG,
we're always saying,

00:49:30.610 --> 00:49:33.880
we're here to make
miracles happen.

00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:34.720
We really do.

00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:36.190
We make incredible--
and being here

00:49:36.190 --> 00:49:38.356
is pretty much a
miracle right now.

00:49:38.356 --> 00:49:39.190
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:39.190 --> 00:49:39.730
But we do.

00:49:39.730 --> 00:49:41.020
We make it happen.

00:49:41.020 --> 00:49:45.100
AUDIENCE: So I have a question
in regards to tech wearables.

00:49:45.100 --> 00:49:48.670
How do you see that tying into
your design in the future?

00:49:48.670 --> 00:49:52.330
And do you see that
as really adding

00:49:52.330 --> 00:49:55.325
to women, and your
design, and your vision?

00:49:55.325 --> 00:49:57.450
LUBOC AZRIA: Well, I think
you guys are innovators.

00:49:57.450 --> 00:49:59.910
So you tell me.

00:49:59.910 --> 00:50:03.144
Because I think the tech
wear-- I mean I tried FitBit.

00:50:03.144 --> 00:50:04.970
I tried different things.

00:50:04.970 --> 00:50:07.200
And I think right now my
comfort zone is not that.

00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:08.710
But that's just me.

00:50:08.710 --> 00:50:12.220
I'm actually looking to
innovators for ideas,

00:50:12.220 --> 00:50:15.940
and collaborating, and
really kind of connecting.

00:50:15.940 --> 00:50:18.410
Because I think that
technology is not my strength.

00:50:18.410 --> 00:50:21.385
But I'm so curious, so curious.

00:50:21.385 --> 00:50:24.010
I want to leave you-- there's a
great story that I want to tell

00:50:24.010 --> 00:50:28.020
you, that is really sweet.

00:50:28.020 --> 00:50:30.020
Do you guys know a
story about coffee bean?

00:50:30.020 --> 00:50:32.410
Not the coffee bean,
like coffee bean.

00:50:32.410 --> 00:50:33.170
No.

00:50:33.170 --> 00:50:38.340
So when you take
an egg, raw egg,

00:50:38.340 --> 00:50:41.912
and you put it in the
boiling water, what happens?

00:50:41.912 --> 00:50:43.630
It gets hard, right?

00:50:43.630 --> 00:50:44.400
Come on.

00:50:44.400 --> 00:50:45.250
I don't cook.

00:50:45.250 --> 00:50:47.070
But you guys, you cook.

00:50:47.070 --> 00:50:49.576
LISA LEE: We actually
have [INAUDIBLE].

00:50:49.576 --> 00:50:51.200
LUBOC AZRIA: So when
you take a raw egg

00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:53.470
and you put it in the
boiling water, it gets hard.

00:50:53.470 --> 00:50:57.800
When you take a carrot
that's hard on the outside

00:50:57.800 --> 00:51:01.590
and you put it in the
boiling water, what happens?

00:51:01.590 --> 00:51:02.760
AUDIENCE: It softens up.

00:51:02.760 --> 00:51:05.610
LUBOC AZRIA: And when
you take a coffee bean

00:51:05.610 --> 00:51:07.610
and you take it and put
it in the boiling water,

00:51:07.610 --> 00:51:09.780
what happens?

00:51:09.780 --> 00:51:10.710
It transcends.

00:51:10.710 --> 00:51:14.550
It creates something that is
beautiful, that's desirable,

00:51:14.550 --> 00:51:15.567
that's delicious.

00:51:15.567 --> 00:51:16.970
I love coffee.

00:51:16.970 --> 00:51:22.120
So in the tough
situations, are you

00:51:22.120 --> 00:51:25.400
going to be like an egg, that's
hard on the outside, soft

00:51:25.400 --> 00:51:27.370
inside, but gets harder?

00:51:27.370 --> 00:51:29.620
Are you going to be like a
carrot, that's really tough

00:51:29.620 --> 00:51:32.360
and get all mushy?

00:51:32.360 --> 00:51:35.250
Are you going to
be a coffee bean

00:51:35.250 --> 00:51:38.900
and transcend, and
find other ways?

00:51:38.900 --> 00:51:40.400
And so I think all
of you are pretty

00:51:40.400 --> 00:51:43.200
much are coffee beans
because otherwise

00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:47.512
you probably wouldn't
be working at Google.

00:51:47.512 --> 00:51:48.970
LISA LEE: Thank
you very, very much

00:51:48.970 --> 00:51:53.680
for sharing your thoughts, your
spring line, and your thoughts

00:51:53.680 --> 00:51:54.350
on leadership.

00:51:54.350 --> 00:51:55.984
I really appreciate
having you here.

00:51:55.984 --> 00:51:57.400
LUBOC AZRIA: It's
such a pleasure.

00:51:57.400 --> 00:51:58.950
Thank you, guys.

00:51:58.950 --> 00:52:01.780
