00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:04.390
Let's attempt to take the
inverse of this 2 by 2 matrix.

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:06.170
And you'll see the
2 by 2 matrices

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:08.480
are about the only
size of matrices

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.670
that it's somewhat pleasant
to take the inverse of.

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:13.810
Anything larger than that,
it becomes very unpleasant.

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:16.030
So the inverse of
a 2 by 2 matrix

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:21.870
is going to be equal to 1 over
the determinant of the matrix

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:24.990
times the adjugate
of the matrix, which

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.460
sounds like a very fancy word.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.887
But we'll see for by a 2 by 2
matrix, it's not too involved.

00:00:30.887 --> 00:00:33.470
So first let's think about what
the determinant of this matrix

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:34.350
is.

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:35.990
Well, we've seen this before.

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:38.650
We just look along
the two diagonals.

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:43.880
It's 3 times 2 minus
negative 7 times 5.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:56.210
So this is going to be equal to
1 over 3 times 2 minus negative

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.290
7 times 5.

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.250
And then the adjugate
of A-- and here

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.874
I'm really just teaching
you the mechanics of it.

00:01:08.874 --> 00:01:11.290
And it's a little unfortunate
that in a typical algebra II

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:13.790
class you kind of just go
into the mechanics of it.

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.410
But at least this will get
us to where we need to go.

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:22.200
So the adjugate of
A, you literally just

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.800
need to swap the two
elements on this diagonal.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.340
So put the 2 where the 3 is
and the 3 where the 2 is.

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.260
So this element right
over here, this 3

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.590
will go right over there.

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:41.710
This 2 will go right over here.

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.580
And then these two elements, you
just take the negative of them.

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:51.241
So the negative-- let
me do a new color.

00:01:51.241 --> 00:01:52.740
Actually, I'm running
out of colors.

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.680
The negative of
that is negative 5.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.480
The negative of
that is positive 7.

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.300
So we are left
with-- this is going

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.670
to be equal to 1
over-- 3 times 2 is 6.

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.612
Negative 7 times
5 is negative 35.

00:02:08.612 --> 00:02:10.320
But then we have this
positive over here.

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.500
So this whole thing
becomes plus 35.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.890
So 6 plus 35 is 41.

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.520
So the determinant
of our matrix is 41.

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.360
We're going to take 1
over the determinant

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:26.030
and multiply it times our
adjugate, times 2, negative 5,

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.000
7, and 3.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.710
So we get -- so this is the
drum roll part -- 2 over 41,

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:35.290
negative 5 over 41.

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.040
I'm just multiplying each of
these elements times 1 over 41.

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.980
7 over 41, and 3 over 41.

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.589
And we are done.
