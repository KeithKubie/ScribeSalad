to use nuclear weapons and I think
that's a worry because even if an Iran

quite dramatically but in a world of

quite dramatically but in a world of
 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.060

about then the probability of a nuclear

about then the probability of a nuclear
 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.429
about then the probability of a nuclear
war is quite high because the stakes are

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439
war is quite high because the stakes are
 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.399

just blow up a few cities but the

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360
just blow up a few cities but the
 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.229
just blow up a few cities but the
probability is higher because you have

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239
probability is higher because you have

missile crisis every year instead of

missile crisis every year instead of
 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.000
missile crisis every year instead of
just one in 50 years so that makes me

just one in 50 years so that makes me
 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.899
just one in 50 years so that makes me
very uneasy and I feel as if we are

very uneasy and I feel as if we are
 

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:24.759
very uneasy and I feel as if we are
stumbling towards a much more dangerous

world in which a nuclear weapon will get
 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.930
world in which a nuclear weapon will get
used sometime soon and this would be a

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940
used sometime soon and this would be a
 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.210
used sometime soon and this would be a
bigger explosion than Hiroshima or

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220
bigger explosion than Hiroshima or
 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.280
bigger explosion than Hiroshima or
Nagasaki because these weapons are far

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290
Nagasaki because these weapons are far
 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.000

more destructive than they used to be
