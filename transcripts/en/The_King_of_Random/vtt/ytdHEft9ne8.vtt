00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
Oh glycerin really doesn't want to mix in you just sort of see the blob hey guys

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.290
I'm Nate welcome back to the workshop where once again

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.290
We're gonna be doing some fun experiments with glow sticks

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:13.080
Last time playing around for glow sticks and the fluid inside we discovered some fun

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:18.958
properties of them like how to make them glow brighter by heating them up, or oddly by mixing them with dish soap

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.699
Today we have a variety of experiments we want to try, we're gonna see what happens if we mix a bunch of different fluids with our

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.699
glow sticks and see if they react at all

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.539
We'll try taking our glow sticks and popping them in the microwave to see what happens if we heat them up like that and then

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.909
We'll take a bunch of our glow stick fluid and we'll put it in the vacuum chamber to see if we get some glowing bubbles

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.390
because I think that would look really cool

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.040
We've got a bunch of glow sticks, and we've got a bunch of stuff to mix into them. Let's get started

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.119
I've got a whole lot of glow sticks cracked open into some cups

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.739
They aren't really activated yet because we haven't cracked open the colored portion in the glass vials,

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.779
but we'll do that one at a time and then try adding our chemicals and see what sort of reactions we get

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.110
There we go very nice, bright liquid this is actually a mix of three different colors

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.180
We've got like the green and the yellow and the orange I think all mixed together

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.930
Really interesting how it can look orange and green at the same time

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.759
Because there looks green, turning a little bit, there's more orange look to it.

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.560
It's really interesting. Now as a reminder for why we're trying all these chemicals

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.640
here's what happens if we mix a little bit of dish soap in with our Glo fluid

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:47.779
It suddenly gets way way brighter, like it was already very bright

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:52.549
And you mix that soap in and it just gets crazy like a lantern

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.568
But putting out all that energy has a cost, it no longer

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.309
lasts nearly as long. Once the soap is mixed in it gets very bright

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:07.849
but then it starts to dim after not too much time. We also discovered that if we go ahead and add more soap

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.789
after it's already started reacting and slowing down,

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:22.759
all of that light just gets sucked right out of it, and we're back down to barely glow. It's not even glowing any more

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.320
Craziness! So that was discovered completely by accident

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:33.000
Let's see if we get any other sorts of kind of similar results from any of these variety of chemicals.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.659
Most of these are just picked at random because I thought they all might have different compositions, and I wanted to see if they would do anything

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.820
That looks like a cup full of lava

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.549
For this one we're gonna see what happens if we mix in some household bleach

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.970
It's actually reacting like something is bubbling and fizzing in there

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:01.639
I don't know if it looks like the color is changing. I don't think it's really getting any brighter,

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.760
but it is reacting

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.920
Let's see what's next

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.589
That's an interesting color right there, this one has four of the magenta sort of colored and one of the orange, and it's giving us

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:24.250
this sort of peach colored glow pretty fun. For this one, we are going to see what happens if we mix in some super glue

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:28.390
Here it goes

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:35.140
Color changed, and I think it's gotten dimmer. Let's add a little bit more

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:40.760
Oh yeah

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.760
That just got way darker

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:47.018
Something about the superglue is stopping the chemical reaction that puts off light

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:54.190
That's interesting, it also seems to be doing a really good job of actually mixing in, like there's not

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:00.610
clumps of superglue floating around or bits of it stuck to the bottom. It seems like it's just dissolved into the liquid

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:10.150
In the first video I talked about how the glow stick fluid has a very oily texture on my fingers

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.500
We'll see what happens if we just mix in a little bit of three in one oil

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:23.000
I think that's getting dimmer. We're losing light

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:28.140
Definitely less bright than it was a second ago. Let's try adding more

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.850
Much dimmer, pulls it way down almost as much as the superglue, I think

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.409
There's still a little bit of glow to it, but not very much

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:50.610
Well we got some cool reactions with the bleach, the superglue, and the three-in-one oil. We didn't get any change with the others, we tried

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.370
dish detergent, Isopropyl alcohol,

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:57.000
Glycerin, hydrogen peroxide, clear Elmer's glue, and methyl alcohol

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
But we didn't see any noticeable results

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.490
with our experiments done of mixing the different chemicals into our Glo fluid,

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:06.089
it's time to move on to our next test, which is going to be microwaving our glow sticks

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:10.830
I've got three identical glow sticks, and we'll prep them all differently to compare the three. One of them

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:15.960
I'll crack and leave out of the microwave, one of them I'll crack and put into the microwave, and the other one I'll put into

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:20.999
the microwave first and then I'll crack it and we'll see what difference in glowing brightness we get out of them

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:34.770
Oh, yeah, that's definitely getting brighter

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:38.410
That was about 10 seconds

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:41.739
You know it's not very warm, though

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:46.210
And I think it is supposed to be the heat that activate so I'm actually just gonna put it in for a little bit longer

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:51.430
Hopefully it doesn't explode in the microwave

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:55.929
All right, that's noticeably warm now

00:05:56.599 --> 00:06:02.979
in my hand, and we can already see the difference between the microwaved one and the not microwaved one, it definitely is brighter

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:05.169
So now let's try cracking

00:06:05.569 --> 00:06:11.679
the microwaved one that hasn't been cracked yet and see if it's the same brightness as the one that we cracked first and then microwaved

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:13.680
I bet it will be

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:19.149
Ooh, and it went very quickly that activated much faster. Might even be a little bit brighter

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:23.409
Maybe that's just because it's been cracked for only a couple seconds and the initial chemical reaction is brighter

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:26.679
We can see that the warm ones are definitely brighter than the cool one

00:06:27.229 --> 00:06:34.089
And it does seem like the one that I microwaved first and then cracked is brighter than the one that cracked and then microwaved

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:39.519
Let's also try taking one of our cups that didn't really seem to react with the chemicals in it and put that in the microwave

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:40.759
and see if it gets brighter

00:06:40.759 --> 00:06:45.189
This is the cup that had the isopropyl alcohol mixed in and it didn't really change much

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:47.409
so let's see if a couple seconds in the microwave heats it up

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:56.459
Oh, yeah absolutely heats it up and makes it much brighter

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:00.330
Oh and I started boiling it, even

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:03.660
That's isopropyl alcohol for you

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:10.500
Doesn't take a lot of heat. Oh, and it's dripping so I may have maybe melted through part of the cup or

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:18.570
Something like that I think yeah, I think the structural integrity of my cup is compromised. That is way brighter

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:24.630
Comparison next to the hydrogen peroxide which also didn't change it much. Heat definitely adds something

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:30.239
We've learned what happens when we mix a bunch of chemicals in with our Glo fluid and we've experimented with using our glow sticks in

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:33.990
the microwave to pretty great effect, it got quite a bit brighter

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:38.669
Now I think what we need to do is take a bunch of our glow stick fluid, put it in a cup and see what happens

00:07:38.669 --> 00:07:40.030
to it in a vacuum chamber

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:42.730
Before I activate our Glo fluid and put it in the vacuum chamber

00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:47.339
I do want the best glow possible, so I am gonna throw it in the microwave for about 10 seconds

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:51.269
I'm not going to add the soap though because I think that might change how it bubbles

00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:56.609
and I'm afraid that it would be really bright, but then die out too quickly. So we'll have it warm

00:07:56.610 --> 00:07:58.610
but no chemicals added to it

00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:24.669
All right, pressure is dropping in the container. I see some bubbles starting to form

00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:34.350
There we go, that is bubbling

00:08:38.919 --> 00:08:41.189
It's about the coolest thing I've ever seen boiling

00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:46.830
Now that I've seen what happens without any soap mixed into it,

00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:51.540
I feel like I kind of have to try with the dish soap mixed in cause it does make it so much brighter

00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:53.940
Let's give it a shot

00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:09.970
Whoa

00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:17.650
All the brightness is going away, not all of it, but a lot of it. Oh, and we get big old bubbles from the soap

00:09:23.450 --> 00:09:26.860
It does look like some weirdo magical potion right there

00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:32.259
But most of that glow is gone

00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:41.860
It's interesting it just looks like there's a little bit of glowy on the very bottom, but that everything else has sort of stopped glowing

00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:46.510
Add back some pressure

00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:56.410
This is pretty wild yeah, we've just got a little bit of glowing on the very bottom of the cup

00:09:57.530 --> 00:10:04.930
Pink too - there was one pink glow stick and four blue glow sticks. Look from the top down, you can also see that it's just

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:07.689
separated around to this ring at the bottom

00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:14.710
Something about the soap and the vacuum really made it separate apart. Maybe that's just the pure fluorescent dye or something

00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:17.439
I'm not sure, let's see if the cup still glows under a blacklight

00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:20.949
It does, but not nearly as much

00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:26.619
Here's the pink color that we mixed one of our other chemicals into and it still has a fair amount of glow

00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:29.530
You can see just how dim this one is at this point

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:33.970
This glow fluid is a lot of fun to play with and we've got some fun ideas of what to do with it

00:10:33.970 --> 00:10:36.040
But if you have any others let us know down in the comments
