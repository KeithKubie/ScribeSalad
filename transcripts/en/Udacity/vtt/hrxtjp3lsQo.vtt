The next question comes from Mark Sanders.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Mark pointed out that regular expressions are very powerful and they are a useful tool,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
but they can quickly become really long and hard to read.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
He wants to know are there tools

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
that we can use online that maybe would help us generate these longer regular expressions,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and if there are, would they be useful?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
So there's a lot you can do with regular expressions,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and I've seen regular expressions that are 2 or 3 lines

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
of just non-stop characters and special symbols and whatnot.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
And at that point I have to say it's usually more useful

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
that you break it up into smaller regular expressions

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
that you connect together with code.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
There's not a whole lot of value, and it's very hard to debug

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
regular expressions that are really long

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
and do your entire program in one go.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
But there are tools that help you generate,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
but more importantly check, your regular expressions.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
There are tools that you just give it text, and you type in your regular expression,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
and it will highlight everything in that text that it matches.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
That's really useful for creating great expressions.

00:00:54.000 --> 09:59:59.000
I highly recommend them if you can find them. &gt;&gt;Okay, thank you.
