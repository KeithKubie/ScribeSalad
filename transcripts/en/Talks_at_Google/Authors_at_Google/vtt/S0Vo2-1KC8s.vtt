00:00:07.292 --> 00:00:08.500
MALE SPEAKER: Good afternoon.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.140
Welcome to Talks at
Google in Cambridge, Mass.

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:14.720
Today it's my enormous
pleasure to welcome

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:18.530
Nick Hornby to Google.

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:19.560
Wow.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:20.602
Nick, welcome.

00:00:20.602 --> 00:00:21.560
NICK HORNBY: Thank you.

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.330
MALE SPEAKER: So great
to have you here.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:31.050
I suspect your reputation and
what you're known for in the UK

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.040
is probably a little
different from how

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.640
you're known in the US.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.230
Just do a quick survey here.

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.402
How many people here have seen
movies made from one or more

00:00:45.402 --> 00:00:46.860
of Nick's books?

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.170
Good representation.

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.750
How many people have read
one or more of Nick's novels?

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.320
Excellent representation.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.260
Very good.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.980
How many people have read
Nick's music criticism

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.251
in "The New Yorker"?

00:01:01.251 --> 00:01:01.750
Yep.

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:02.280
Hands.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.000
Excellent.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.290
How many people have
read Nick's book reviews

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.840
either in "The Believer"
or in collections

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.920
that have been published?

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:12.550
All right.

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:13.380
Wow.

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.980
OK.

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:15.310
I might have misspoken.

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.500
Very, very
well-represented here.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.030
How many people know
that in addition

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.410
to being the author of the
things we just mentioned,

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:26.015
Nick is also a screenwriter?

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:30.534
How many people--

00:01:30.534 --> 00:01:31.450
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:32.200
MALE SPEAKER: Yes.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.980
Yes, it is.

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:33.580
Yes, it is.

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.163
NICK HORNBY: I'm
never going to speak.

00:01:35.163 --> 00:01:38.590
MALE SPEAKER: With PERF coming
up in just a few months,

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:39.860
this will be noted.

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:41.110
Sorry.

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:41.610
OK.

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.290
So actually, quite
well-known in the US.

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:50.530
So the point being that you are
a man and author of many parts,

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.060
certainly best
known here, I think,

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.400
for the novels and the movies
that have been made from them,

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.600
but certainly also
well-represented

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.390
in the nonfiction area as well.

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.130
And--

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.590
NICK HORNBY: Well,
it's interesting,

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.255
because in some ways, I
prefer my American career

00:02:11.255 --> 00:02:18.200
to my British career,
because everything in the UK

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.300
is seen through the prism of
my first book, which was "Fever

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.980
Pitch," and because I
wrote about football,

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:26.720
then that was it.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.730
I was a football writer forever.

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.360
And of course, things
like "The Believer,"

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.180
they're only
published here anyway.

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:43.470
The magazine doesn't
really get read in the US.

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:49.910
And I suppose recently, the
screenplay stuff-- people

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:51.740
saw "An Education" in the UK.

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:53.910
They haven't seen "Wild" really.

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.760
It just came out last week.

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:01.717
So I probably have more of
a mix in the US than the UK.

00:03:01.717 --> 00:03:02.800
MALE SPEAKER: Interesting.

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.812
So you've sort of been
typecast as a football writer?

00:03:06.812 --> 00:03:07.520
NICK HORNBY: Yes.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.670
I mean, I've only written
one football book,

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.140
and it was 20 years
ago, but I think

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.550
there's something about
writing about sport that

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:19.310
means that you are
ghettoized forever.

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:20.780
Doesn't matter what I write.

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.180
From now on, I will
always be a sports writer.

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.490
It's OK, because I
don't actually do it,

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:29.680
so they could ghettoize
me all they like.

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:30.871
MALE SPEAKER: Right.

00:03:30.871 --> 00:03:31.550
OK, well.

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:39.150
And actually the next question,
of course, here in the States,

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.980
we just had one of our biggest
annual sporting events,

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.740
which is the Super Bowl.

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:49.820
And of course, as you were
just talking about your career

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:54.085
started off with "Fever
Pitch," which by the way,

00:03:54.085 --> 00:03:59.670
is on my list of one of the
top five titles of all time.

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:01.490
Such a great concept.

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:04.630
So not to ghettoize
you further, but if we

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:08.300
had to start off by talking
about sports, one thing that

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:10.890
struck me, I've never
lived in the UK,

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:13.400
but just from reading
about it, well,

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.560
Americans can be
great sports fans.

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.959
It's always seemed to me that
just from reading about it

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:23.580
that there's something
very different in the UK

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:29.040
that British-- maybe
obsession is putting it

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:34.170
too strongly, maybe not-- but
the bond between UK soccer

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:37.110
fans in their
teens is so strong,

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.940
a lifelong thing, as
you can attest to,

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:42.910
that seems to be entirely
different from what

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:44.590
we have in the US.

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:46.840
Is that something
you've noticed as well?

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.540
NICK HORNBY: Yes.

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:52.950
I think that Americans
obviously love sports.

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:58.650
But I think there's
much more enjoyment

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:03.060
of sport as an event in the US.

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:08.630
And there are a couple
of explanations, I think.

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:12.000
One is that baseball,
you can't see

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.470
every game of the
baseball season.

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:17.380
And even if you're
a big baseball fan,

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:20.110
you don't go to
all the home games.

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:22.190
No one has a life,
pretty much, that

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:26.130
can accommodate every single
home game in a baseball season,

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:29.820
and the away games are
too far away, whereas it's

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:35.720
routine in the UK never to miss
a home game of your football

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:36.220
team.

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:39.730
And a significant
subsection of those people

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:43.700
never miss an away game either.

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:47.480
In person, I mean, actually
sitting in the stadiums.

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:50.660
And that's partly because
of the length of the season.

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:57.500
That elite season is 38
games, so it's conceivable

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.030
that you can go to all of those.

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:01.120
And the size of the
country, of course,

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:03.380
as well, that means
that there's no away

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:07.450
game you can go to where you
can't get back that night.

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:11.440
And I do think that makes
for a different culture.

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:15.110
And also, of course, I think
probably more true in America,

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:19.510
but lots of people don't live in
the cities where they grew up.

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:24.000
There's more freedom of
movement, as it were,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.930
in the US.

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:30.940
So I think that there is
possibly a greater intensity.

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:34.410
An American football
season is really short,

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:38.150
and it would be hard to
base your life around that.

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:40.170
The baseball season's too long.

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:43.365
And the other thing is that
you are genuinely interested,

00:06:43.365 --> 00:06:47.660
I think, as a population,
in more than one sport.

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:51.700
And so people spread themselves
over, certainly over baseball,

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:55.170
football, maybe
hockey, basketball,

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:59.640
whereas I'd say over the
last 20 years, football--

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:02.520
we have become one
sport in the UK.

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:04.630
It used to be
football and cricket,

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:12.810
but cricket has become much more
of a minority sport probably

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:16.180
since Rupert Murdoch's
television money.

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:20.130
So we're very, very intense
about the football and not

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:21.550
much else.

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:22.310
MALE SPEAKER: Wow.

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:26.490
I had no idea cricked had
been sort of deprecated.

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:28.300
NICK HORNBY: Well,
cricket's difficult,

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:33.010
because it is a game
that lasts for five days.

00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:36.110
And usually at the
end of the five days,

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:42.510
it's a draw, because actually,
five days isn't long enough.

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:45.380
But they figure they can't
go on longer than five days,

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:52.250
but you can't bowl a team out
twice in five days, basically.

00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:54.870
So I'd say about
half the games end

00:07:54.870 --> 00:08:00.200
in a draw, and the equivalent,
the international games are

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:02.630
big, especially when
England play Australia.

00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:05.910
And then it's sold
out crowds of 30,000,

00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:10.160
and they play five times over
the course of the summer.

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:14.090
And there is a sense of
that is something happening,

00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:15.970
and people are watching.

00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:18.640
But the club games
are between counties,

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:22.690
so Kent will play against
Somerset over five days

00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:25.590
during the week, during the day.

00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:30.940
So it's usually in front of
crowds of 20 or 30 people.

00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:33.429
And it's kind of hard to
get excited about that,

00:08:33.429 --> 00:08:36.480
whereas football is a
working person's sport.

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:39.760
They play outside of
work hours one evening

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:42.020
during the week
and then weekend,

00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:44.732
so it's possible
to see everything.

00:08:44.732 --> 00:08:45.616
MALE SPEAKER: Oh, OK.

00:08:45.616 --> 00:08:48.670
Of course, here in
Boston, as you may know,

00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:53.350
our local billionaire, John
Henry, owns Liverpool FC.

00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:57.140
I hope that doesn't upset
you as an Arsenal fan.

00:08:57.140 --> 00:09:01.020
NICK HORNBY: But Stan
Kroenke owns Arsenal,

00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:05.480
who's an American
who owns-- well,

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:09.320
he's-- I think he's a-- does
anyone know what Stan Kroenke

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:10.200
owns?

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:13.540
It's a couple of sports
teams here in America,

00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:18.800
and I think his wife
owns Walmart as well.

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:21.960
So there's almost
no English club

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:26.700
that's owned by-- no big English
club is owned by English people

00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:27.200
anymore.

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:27.908
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:09:27.908 --> 00:09:29.840
Is that a fairly
recent phenomenon?

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:30.860
NICK HORNBY: Yep.

00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:35.677
Again, since, pretty much
since the Murdoch money.

00:09:35.677 --> 00:09:36.427
MALE SPEAKER: Wow.

00:09:36.427 --> 00:09:37.620
That name keeps coming up.

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:40.950
NICK HORNBY: It
does keep coming up.

00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:43.570
We have a big problem
now with English sport,

00:09:43.570 --> 00:09:48.980
because it's become
uncompetitive, the football.

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:52.610
I think most people feel
that only two teams can

00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:55.150
win the championship
in England, and they're

00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:57.460
both-- one's owned
by an oligarch,

00:09:57.460 --> 00:10:02.180
and one's owned by a sheik,
and their budgets are

00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:06.680
more or less unlimited,
and this year, one of them

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:09.130
will finish first, and the
other one will finish second.

00:10:09.130 --> 00:10:12.470
Last year, it was
the other way around.

00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:14.560
And it's hard to
get really excited.

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:16.840
Arsenal can't win
a championship.

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:18.910
Liverpool can't
win a championship,

00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:20.990
unless something changes.

00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:27.190
They're trying to alter the
laws so that these clubs have

00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:30.760
to be run as a business,
meaning that you can't spend

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:34.350
an infinite amount without
bringing anything back in.

00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:36.820
But they always have all
kinds of ways around it,

00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:39.860
and it's a little bit
depressing at the moment.

00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:41.140
MALE SPEAKER: Sure.

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:41.770
Absolutely.

00:10:41.770 --> 00:10:43.770
NICK HORNBY: When you've
got lots of rich people

00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:47.290
who own sporting clubs,
but you've got draft picks,

00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:50.310
and you've got salary caps, and
you've got all sorts of things

00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:53.700
that actually we can't
do, because we have

00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:56.350
the disadvantage of playing a
game that the rest of the world

00:10:56.350 --> 00:10:59.610
plays, whereas America
only plays American sports.

00:11:03.277 --> 00:11:04.360
MALE SPEAKER: That's true.

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:07.280
I can never get over the fact
that beach volleyball became

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:09.612
an Olympic sport, so that's--

00:11:09.612 --> 00:11:11.320
NICK HORNBY: There's
a very funny episode

00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:13.300
of "30 Rock" where
one of the characters

00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:16.120
discovers that most of
the sports he was watching

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:19.790
at the Summer Olympics were
actually staged by a network

00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:22.220
and didn't really
exist out in the world,

00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:24.000
but had been invented
to give Americans

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.470
medals at the Olympics.

00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:28.255
MALE SPEAKER: Sure.

00:11:28.255 --> 00:11:29.705
Like beach volleyball.

00:11:29.705 --> 00:11:31.163
NICK HORNBY: Like
beach volleyball.

00:11:34.410 --> 00:11:37.750
MALE SPEAKER: So switching
from sports to writing,

00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:40.550
you wrote the screenplay
for the British version

00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:42.100
of "Fever Pitch."

00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:44.840
I do want to get back
to screenwriting later

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:47.250
in the conversation.

00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:49.210
Just have to ask
you, having written

00:11:49.210 --> 00:11:51.130
a screenplay for
the British version,

00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:53.080
what did you think of
the American version?

00:11:55.789 --> 00:11:56.580
NICK HORNBY: Well--

00:11:59.455 --> 00:12:00.955
MALE SPEAKER: I
have my own opinion.

00:12:00.955 --> 00:12:02.826
I didn't want to ask
a leading question.

00:12:02.826 --> 00:12:04.700
NICK HORNBY: Well, first
of all, I completely

00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:08.390
understood why it
happened, because it's

00:12:08.390 --> 00:12:11.640
impossible to have
the same connection

00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:16.060
with an American soccer club.

00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:18.380
The clubs just haven't
existed for long enough,

00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:20.890
and it's not rooted
enough in the culture yet,

00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:23.910
so the idea of somebody
who's a grown man

00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:26.270
having had an unbroken
relationship with a soccer team

00:12:26.270 --> 00:12:30.350
since he was a kid-- that
can't happen in the US.

00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:34.635
It had to be
another sport, and I

00:12:34.635 --> 00:12:38.200
mean there's a very funny story,
which I'm sure some of you

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:43.000
are aware of with that movie,
which was that they chose

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.800
the Boston Red Sox, because they
wanted a team that never won.

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:52.570
And it's a very rare
example of Americans

00:12:52.570 --> 00:12:55.930
taking a triumphalist
British film,

00:12:55.930 --> 00:12:57.760
and turning it
into something kind

00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:01.140
of miserable and depressing.

00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:03.810
And so the script was
written about a guy who

00:13:03.810 --> 00:13:07.100
supports the Red Sox
and loves the Red Sox,

00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:10.610
and they break his
heart every single year.

00:13:10.610 --> 00:13:15.320
And they started making
this movie in July.

00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:20.330
And then as it got to August,
they started to joke about,

00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:22.990
yeah, wouldn't it just be
typical if this was the year?

00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:25.550
And then the Red
Sox won the pennant,

00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:27.150
and then they got
to the World Series,

00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:28.733
and then they realized
they were going

00:13:28.733 --> 00:13:31.550
to have to rewrite
the end of the movie.

00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:34.280
And they did this as the
Red Sox were winning it,

00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:38.790
which is how come Drew
Barrymore and Jimmy Fallon were

00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:43.090
on the field for the
last shots of the movie,

00:13:43.090 --> 00:13:45.650
with permission from the club.

00:13:45.650 --> 00:13:49.550
So all that was kind of
incredible that it happened,

00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:53.810
and those shots were incredible
at the end of the film.

00:13:53.810 --> 00:13:57.830
It was much more a kind of
mainstream romantic comedy

00:13:57.830 --> 00:14:03.490
than, certainly, the book was
and than the English movie was.

00:14:03.490 --> 00:14:08.720
I think that it was more about
Drew Barrymore, the movie,

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:11.820
and her character than sport.

00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:15.650
So I slightly regretted that
it had become that thing.

00:14:15.650 --> 00:14:16.912
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:14:16.912 --> 00:14:18.370
I'm not surprised.

00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:28.040
"High Fidelity," also
on my top five titles.

00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:31.120
But just so you know,
the top five titles

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:35.420
do have at least one Nick
Hornby entry, HMS Pinafore

00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:37.607
[INAUDIBLE].

00:14:37.607 --> 00:14:39.440
NICK HORNBY: I'm always
in a list with that.

00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:43.430
MALE SPEAKER: I know.

00:14:43.430 --> 00:14:46.710
How does this keep
happening to you?

00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:49.490
NICK HORNBY: Haunted by Gilbert
and Sullivan my entire life.

00:14:49.490 --> 00:14:51.860
MALE SPEAKER: That,
plus football, right?

00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:55.740
So your first novel, probably
your first transatlantic

00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:58.850
success, I would guess.

00:14:58.850 --> 00:15:02.550
To me, it seemed that John
Cusack completely got the book.

00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:04.760
I was really astonished
by the movie.

00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:08.000
I thought it was an
extraordinary adaptation,

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.910
despite the change of scenery.

00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:12.270
How did you feel about it?

00:15:12.270 --> 00:15:13.700
NICK HORNBY: I loved it.

00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:16.670
I loved the whole process of it.

00:15:19.690 --> 00:15:23.640
I mean, my relationship with
the books and the movies,

00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:28.700
when I adapted
"Fever Pitch," I was

00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:32.880
whatever I was-- 35 years old
when I began to adapt to it.

00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:36.410
I hadn't written a novel.

00:15:36.410 --> 00:15:40.500
I didn't know whether
anyone would ever ask again,

00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:43.560
whether anyone would want to
adapt one of my books again,

00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:46.410
whether I'd ever be asked
to adapt it myself again,

00:15:46.410 --> 00:15:51.160
and I had a family,
new baby, I was

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:53.060
in no position to
turn down work.

00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:55.820
So when somebody, a producer
came to me and said,

00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:58.810
we want to make a movie
out of "Fever Pitch,"

00:15:58.810 --> 00:16:01.960
and we want you to try
to do the adaptation,

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:04.770
I didn't think
about it, because I

00:16:04.770 --> 00:16:06.710
had a freelance mentality
where I thought,

00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:09.320
someone's offering to
pay me to do something.

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:11.670
I'd better do it.

00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:15.380
And after I'd done it, and other
books started to be adapted,

00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:18.450
I thought, I don't want to
ever adapt my own work again.

00:16:18.450 --> 00:16:19.690
I want to move on.

00:16:19.690 --> 00:16:23.420
I want to do the next thing.

00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:26.130
It's two, three years of
work, a book, and then

00:16:26.130 --> 00:16:28.760
you get to the end of
it, and someone says,

00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:31.930
we want you to take most
of it out, and write it

00:16:31.930 --> 00:16:33.160
in a different form.

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:36.680
Your spirit does-- I find
the spirits lower a bit

00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:38.250
with the prospect of that.

00:16:38.250 --> 00:16:39.960
So when it came time
to "High Fidelity,"

00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:42.910
I said I don't want
to do it myself.

00:16:42.910 --> 00:16:47.680
And I was surprised
when they said

00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:52.250
we want to set it in the US.

00:16:52.250 --> 00:16:58.500
But when I talked to John,
and he's with these two guys

00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:02.410
called [? DV ?] and Steve,
and it's kind of sweet.

00:17:02.410 --> 00:17:04.569
They'd all grown up in Chicago.

00:17:04.569 --> 00:17:05.910
They'd grown up together.

00:17:05.910 --> 00:17:09.490
They're all the same age,
two writers and John.

00:17:09.490 --> 00:17:16.400
And they thought the
book was about them.

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:19.810
It was their relationship
with music, their relationship

00:17:19.810 --> 00:17:24.180
with women, and
of course, that's

00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:26.029
what you want someone
to feel if they're

00:17:26.029 --> 00:17:31.960
going to adapt your book, and
they changed it so cleverly,

00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:35.800
because they changed the frame
of reference for the music,

00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:37.500
because they were
younger than me,

00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:40.420
so the references
were different.

00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:42.570
They weren't the
same as in the book.

00:17:42.570 --> 00:17:45.590
The feeling was the same.

00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:50.780
There were some very specific
references to Chicago in there.

00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:55.670
The Chicago Reader and
some of the clubs, and I

00:17:55.670 --> 00:17:59.560
just thought it was done in
a really, really intelligent

00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:02.190
and loving way.

00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:04.320
And then grumpy
old Stephen Frears

00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:08.930
from England was the
director to kind of oversee,

00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:11.270
knew what I was talking
about with the book

00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:13.910
and knew what they were
talking about with America.

00:18:13.910 --> 00:18:17.950
And it was just all a really
kind of happy experience.

00:18:17.950 --> 00:18:19.580
MALE SPEAKER: Oh, that's great.

00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:24.080
I have to say, one of the
key parts of the movie for me

00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:26.550
was the casting of Laura.

00:18:26.550 --> 00:18:28.390
Reading the book,
for whatever reason,

00:18:28.390 --> 00:18:31.930
I couldn't get a really
clear mental image of her,

00:18:31.930 --> 00:18:35.280
but as soon as the Danish
actress, whose name I can never

00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:40.345
remember or pronounce, came
on screen, I said, wow.

00:18:40.345 --> 00:18:40.920
That's Laura.

00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:42.510
That's her.

00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:46.360
I mean, how did you feel
about the casting overall?

00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:47.750
NICK HORNBY: The casting of Rob?

00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:48.310
MALE SPEAKER: Or anybody.

00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:49.450
NICK HORNBY: Or anybody.

00:18:49.450 --> 00:18:53.290
Well, I think that one
of the things that's

00:18:53.290 --> 00:18:55.430
wrong with "High
Fidelity" as a book

00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:59.800
is that I was scared
to write women.

00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:05.220
It was my first novel, and
I knew who the guy was,

00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:08.030
and I sort of knew
who the girl was,

00:19:08.030 --> 00:19:14.340
but she's-- I think she's
too good in the book.

00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:20.910
She's just there as an adult
who's everything that Rob

00:19:20.910 --> 00:19:21.590
isn't.

00:19:21.590 --> 00:19:27.820
And she didn't have, I think,
enough quirks or reality

00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:28.640
to her.

00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:30.550
And as my career
has gone on, I felt

00:19:30.550 --> 00:19:36.030
more confident to write about
women who messed up in some way

00:19:36.030 --> 00:19:41.110
or annoying or bad or
something, but that first novel,

00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:45.340
I would say it's a
floor in the book.

00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:48.880
So when you say you can't
get a clear mental image,

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:51.480
I'm really not surprised.

00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:57.310
And it's a slightly thankless
role in the movie, as well.

00:19:57.310 --> 00:20:01.410
She's great, Iben,
but it's John's movie,

00:20:01.410 --> 00:20:09.100
and I think that was the last
time I let myself do that.

00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:10.730
I thought, from
now on, the women

00:20:10.730 --> 00:20:14.147
have to be a lot realer
than they are in this.

00:20:14.147 --> 00:20:14.938
MALE SPEAKER: Sure.

00:20:14.938 --> 00:20:15.926
OK.

00:20:15.926 --> 00:20:19.660
NICK HORNBY: One
thing that was really

00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:23.530
amazing about the movie--
when you're writing a book,

00:20:23.530 --> 00:20:25.840
you can obviously have
a character do anything,

00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:34.810
because it's fiction, and the
character of Barry in the book

00:20:34.810 --> 00:20:41.210
is kind of this annoying,
obnoxious, quite funny, record

00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:46.520
store guy, who turns out
to have a great voice.

00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:49.220
And you can write
this in a novel.

00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:51.610
You can write
anything, and when I

00:20:51.610 --> 00:20:56.320
was talking to the guys about
the movie, I said, oh, yeah.

00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:58.190
And then you've
got this character.

00:20:58.190 --> 00:21:00.300
And they said, we
know who that is.

00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:02.080
And I said, what?

00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:03.840
You know an actor
who can do that?

00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:05.890
They said, yeah, we know
an actor who can do it.

00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:09.440
And they knew Jack Black from
kind of alternative comedy,

00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:13.890
and he'd not done a comic
role in his movie career,

00:21:13.890 --> 00:21:17.420
and that was his first.

00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:19.720
That was absolutely
his breakout role,

00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:23.730
and I couldn't believe that they
knew the person who I fondly

00:21:23.730 --> 00:21:27.170
imagined would only exist
on the pages of a book.

00:21:27.170 --> 00:21:28.820
It was very clever casting.

00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:29.910
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:21:29.910 --> 00:21:31.115
Sort of an iconic role.

00:21:31.115 --> 00:21:32.365
NICK HORNBY: Yeah, completely.

00:21:32.365 --> 00:21:33.020
Yeah.

00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:34.360
MALE SPEAKER: Absolutely.

00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:38.884
And pairing him off with
Todd Louiso as a sad sack,

00:21:38.884 --> 00:21:40.050
and the store was brilliant.

00:21:40.050 --> 00:21:41.220
NICK HORNBY: Yes.

00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:44.340
The casting is great.

00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:49.320
And there's always-- I
have a bit of sadness.

00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:53.570
There's a scene in the book that
people quite often ask about,

00:21:53.570 --> 00:21:55.590
because they say, why
wasn't that in the movie?

00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:58.220
And there's a scene
in the book where

00:21:58.220 --> 00:22:01.530
Rob is called to
a woman's house,

00:22:01.530 --> 00:22:05.490
and she's selling off her
husband's record collection

00:22:05.490 --> 00:22:08.020
for no money, because she
wants to get back at him,

00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:11.080
and he has the most amazing
record collection in the world.

00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:16.090
And Rob Is so tortured by being
offered it for cheap that he

00:22:16.090 --> 00:22:18.710
walks out on it
and won't buy it.

00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:24.050
And they did make that scene.

00:22:24.050 --> 00:22:29.390
Beverly D'Angelo was the woman
selling the record collection,

00:22:29.390 --> 00:22:31.460
but she got cut completely.

00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:33.230
In fact, in the
movie, you can see

00:22:33.230 --> 00:22:35.990
Rob talking to her on
the phone, but they never

00:22:35.990 --> 00:22:37.782
use the actual scene.

00:22:37.782 --> 00:22:38.754
MALE SPEAKER: Oh, OK.

00:22:38.754 --> 00:22:40.050
I remember him talking.

00:22:40.050 --> 00:22:42.131
NICK HORNBY: It's on YouTube.

00:22:42.131 --> 00:22:42.880
MALE SPEAKER: Yes.

00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:44.360
Where everything is.

00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:46.210
NICK HORNBY: Yeah.

00:22:46.210 --> 00:22:47.740
MALE SPEAKER: So
speaking of movies,

00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:50.350
were you surprised
when people first

00:22:50.350 --> 00:22:52.630
talked about making
your books into movies?

00:22:52.630 --> 00:22:55.890
I guess "Fever
Pitch," obviously.

00:22:55.890 --> 00:22:57.540
NICK HORNBY: Yes.

00:22:57.540 --> 00:23:00.710
I was amazed.

00:23:00.710 --> 00:23:03.390
At the beginning of a career,
I think everything is amazing,

00:23:03.390 --> 00:23:08.920
because your first ambition
is to try and get published,

00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:12.160
and your second
ambition is for somebody

00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:14.480
to walk into a bookstore
and buy the book.

00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:18.297
And amongst those two
things have been achieved,

00:23:18.297 --> 00:23:19.380
you think well, that's it.

00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:20.950
I now have got to
write the next one.

00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:23.660
But it was amazing
to me that somebody

00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:26.390
said they wanted to make a movie
of "Fever Pitch," which wasn't

00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:30.250
a movie in there's
no story in the book.

00:23:30.250 --> 00:23:32.580
It's a memoir, and
it covers 25 years,

00:23:32.580 --> 00:23:34.790
and it's written in the
form of match reports.

00:23:34.790 --> 00:23:37.890
And I wasn't
thinking in that way.

00:23:37.890 --> 00:23:39.880
Also, the other thing
I was going to say

00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:43.360
is being published in other
countries, which again never

00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:46.660
occurred to me at all
when I started writing.

00:23:46.660 --> 00:23:49.610
So "Fever Pitch"
was a big surprise,

00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:52.900
and then "High Fidelity,"
a smaller surprise I guess,

00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:54.920
because it had already
started to happen

00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:58.630
with "Fever Pitch" at the time.

00:23:58.630 --> 00:24:03.120
And then I got used to the idea
that actually, where I still

00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:05.270
don't think most
people know this,

00:24:05.270 --> 00:24:09.900
but more or less, any book
with a story and characters

00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:15.200
in gets optioned at some
point in the film food chain.

00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:18.430
And that might be a studio
who are willing to pay you

00:24:18.430 --> 00:24:22.120
proper money for it, or it might
be a 22-year-old who's just

00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:24.330
set up as an
independent producer

00:24:24.330 --> 00:24:27.094
three doors down the street
on his computer saying,

00:24:27.094 --> 00:24:28.260
will you give me the rights?

00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:33.130
I promise you if anything ever
gets made, I'll see you right.

00:24:33.130 --> 00:24:37.310
But the vast majority
of them don't get made,

00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:41.060
and my great good fortune
is, so far, that most of them

00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:43.780
seem to have been made.

00:24:43.780 --> 00:24:46.470
MALE SPEAKER: Congratulations.

00:24:46.470 --> 00:24:48.810
So going back even
further than that,

00:24:48.810 --> 00:24:52.030
what drove you to be a
writer in the first place?

00:24:56.547 --> 00:24:58.880
NICK HORNBY: Well, I guess
it's just one of those things

00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:02.320
that I couldn't seem
to do anything about.

00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:06.520
When young people ask me
for advice about writing,

00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:11.080
the first thing I say is
if you can stop, stop.

00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:12.840
That's the best advice.

00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:15.130
And if you can't
stop, then tough.

00:25:15.130 --> 00:25:17.220
You're a writer.

00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:22.260
And that was pretty much my
situation that I couldn't stop,

00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:26.330
and I didn't care how
many times I got rejected.

00:25:26.330 --> 00:25:30.130
I would just start off
with the next thing

00:25:30.130 --> 00:25:34.230
with an increasingly
heavy heart, obviously.

00:25:34.230 --> 00:25:38.540
But I was doing that thing
where I had parted company

00:25:38.540 --> 00:25:42.540
from my peers in terms of they
were on some kind of career

00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:44.650
ladder, and I was drifting
in and out of work,

00:25:44.650 --> 00:25:47.050
because I'd write something.

00:25:47.050 --> 00:25:48.920
I started off trying
to write scripts.

00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:51.040
I would write something
and get it rejected,

00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:53.540
then go back to work,
and work for awhile,

00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:57.040
and then get enough money
to leave work for awhile.

00:25:57.040 --> 00:25:59.930
I have anxious parents
and anxious girlfriends,

00:25:59.930 --> 00:26:03.330
and you just feel like you're
walking the plank, really,

00:26:03.330 --> 00:26:07.600
that you can't go back,
because there's nothing back

00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:10.910
there, so you've just
got to keep on going.

00:26:10.910 --> 00:26:13.370
But it has always
felt like a need,

00:26:13.370 --> 00:26:16.750
and it still feels like a need.

00:26:16.750 --> 00:26:19.800
When I contemplate
retirement, I contemplate

00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:23.380
writing really-- short
stories or something,

00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:24.580
but it would be writing.

00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:25.780
MALE SPEAKER: Oh, OK.

00:26:25.780 --> 00:26:29.180
So you started off writing
movie scripts or TV scripts?

00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:32.142
NICK HORNBY: I don't know
what they were, actually.

00:26:32.142 --> 00:26:33.850
I didn't know the
first thing about them.

00:26:33.850 --> 00:26:38.700
They were probably somewhere
between BBC radio plays

00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:44.970
and feature movies, but
really kind of indistinct.

00:26:44.970 --> 00:26:48.940
We did have some-- we had a long
tradition throughout probably

00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:53.820
the '60s and '70s of
one-hour plays on the BBC.

00:26:53.820 --> 00:26:55.030
They don't make them anymore.

00:26:55.030 --> 00:26:56.720
They're sort of one-off
things, and lots

00:26:56.720 --> 00:27:00.050
of dramatists and
screenwriters cut their teeth

00:27:00.050 --> 00:27:02.170
on those things.

00:27:02.170 --> 00:27:05.120
And I was continuing
to write those long

00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:07.680
after the BBC had
stopped making them.

00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:09.520
I knew the BBC had
stopped making them.

00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:11.360
I don't know why I
wrote what I wrote.

00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:13.470
That was just the right form.

00:27:13.470 --> 00:27:19.380
But I think the thing
about writing movies

00:27:19.380 --> 00:27:24.350
is that no one can take a
chance on you with a script.

00:27:24.350 --> 00:27:27.980
The brilliant thing about
book writing and publishing

00:27:27.980 --> 00:27:30.620
is that a publisher
can read a novel

00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:33.600
and think, OK,
this is quite good.

00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:38.350
And the second book might be
really good, and the third one,

00:27:38.350 --> 00:27:43.010
we might begin to see
something on our investment.

00:27:43.010 --> 00:27:47.590
And so you can give an
author not very much money

00:27:47.590 --> 00:27:51.820
and print not very many books,
but you can nurture a career,

00:27:51.820 --> 00:27:55.590
whereas with
screenplays, they cost

00:27:55.590 --> 00:27:59.490
between five and $50 million,
and it doesn't matter

00:27:59.490 --> 00:28:02.600
how much you believe
in someone's future,

00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:06.790
you can't invest that sort
of money in the script.

00:28:06.790 --> 00:28:13.160
And I think prose is easily the
best way to start as a writer,

00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:15.850
if you can.

00:28:15.850 --> 00:28:19.330
MALE SPEAKER: So let's
say we're compiling advice

00:28:19.330 --> 00:28:22.100
to young would-be writers here.

00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:23.190
Don't write, if you can--

00:28:23.190 --> 00:28:23.460
NICK HORNBY: Don't write--

00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:24.982
MALE SPEAKER:
--possibly not write.

00:28:24.982 --> 00:28:26.190
NICK HORNBY: It's number one.

00:28:26.190 --> 00:28:29.270
MALE SPEAKER: If you must write,
write prose, not screenplays.

00:28:29.270 --> 00:28:31.020
NICK HORNBY: Yeah.

00:28:31.020 --> 00:28:33.190
Or have the two things
on the go, at least.

00:28:33.190 --> 00:28:35.880
I mean there are young
screenwriters who

00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:41.820
become screenwriters, but
I think it's a hard route.

00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:44.910
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, definitely.

00:28:44.910 --> 00:28:49.130
So in terms of your writing,
I find in both your nonfiction

00:28:49.130 --> 00:28:54.540
and your fiction, there's sort
of a conversational quality

00:28:54.540 --> 00:28:59.670
that comes across as, to me,
an effortlessness that almost

00:28:59.670 --> 00:29:03.370
invariably means throughout
literature that the writer is

00:29:03.370 --> 00:29:07.110
really sweat and
blood to achieve.

00:29:07.110 --> 00:29:09.430
I come across that
countless times.

00:29:09.430 --> 00:29:12.600
I'll admire somebody's
writing, and say, oh, they're

00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:14.770
toying with us.

00:29:14.770 --> 00:29:16.930
They just write so
easily, and you read,

00:29:16.930 --> 00:29:18.800
well, I write three
sentences a day,

00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:22.240
and I go back the next day,
and I cross everything out,

00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:26.320
and rewrite them like Annie
Dillard, for instance.

00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:28.110
How does your
writing process work?

00:29:28.110 --> 00:29:31.300
I've read a little bit about
how you go to your workplace

00:29:31.300 --> 00:29:34.590
or office, not far
from your house,

00:29:34.590 --> 00:29:38.480
and you will write for
however many hours.

00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:40.500
How much of that is
original writing?

00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:42.610
How much is rewriting?

00:29:42.610 --> 00:29:45.150
How much pain and torture
is involved, basically?

00:29:49.430 --> 00:29:52.830
NICK HORNBY: My first drafts
tend to be in reasonable shape.

00:29:57.450 --> 00:30:01.760
But the process of
getting to a first draft,

00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:03.930
I can't stand leaving
something that I

00:30:03.930 --> 00:30:07.470
know isn't right, so there
is a lot of rewriting

00:30:07.470 --> 00:30:11.045
during the first draft,
if you show it to me,

00:30:11.045 --> 00:30:13.490
and I can't just
splurge a first draft,

00:30:13.490 --> 00:30:16.470
and then go back
and work it over.

00:30:16.470 --> 00:30:19.800
I have to know that
paragraph by paragraph,

00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:23.090
things are in reasonable
shape before I progress.

00:30:23.090 --> 00:30:27.550
So there will be a lot of work
that goes into each paragraph,

00:30:27.550 --> 00:30:30.870
and once I've got to
the end of a draft,

00:30:30.870 --> 00:30:34.090
it's in a position where I
can turn it in and give it

00:30:34.090 --> 00:30:37.440
to an editor and
work with an editor.

00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:41.390
That thing of
writing 80,000 words

00:30:41.390 --> 00:30:44.570
without looking at it just
to get it down on paper

00:30:44.570 --> 00:30:45.840
doesn't happen for me.

00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:49.600
It comes in little
bits and jerks

00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:53.470
and really kind of annoying.

00:30:53.470 --> 00:30:57.670
My writing process really
annoys me, and I don't like it,

00:30:57.670 --> 00:31:00.580
but there isn't much
I can do about it.

00:31:00.580 --> 00:31:07.360
I try and write between
500 and 1000 words a day,

00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:11.490
which isn't that much.

00:31:11.490 --> 00:31:14.730
Well, it doesn't feel like that
much, but if you do the maths,

00:31:14.730 --> 00:31:21.650
this book is 100,000 words,
it should be 100 days' work.

00:31:21.650 --> 00:31:22.640
It wasn't.

00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:24.495
I can't account for
the rest of the time.

00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:35.880
It's not a particularly
enjoyable process for me,

00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:40.270
but I do want it to
be conversational.

00:31:40.270 --> 00:31:42.580
I do want it to be
accessible, and that

00:31:42.580 --> 00:31:48.230
does mean going through
some kind of digestive--

00:31:48.230 --> 00:31:55.790
I'll stop with the metaphor,
but the conversational aspect

00:31:55.790 --> 00:31:57.930
of it, yes, has worked.

00:31:57.930 --> 00:31:58.960
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:02.050
Well, actually this paints
kind of a grim picture,

00:32:02.050 --> 00:32:03.990
because I remember
from "Fever Pitch," one

00:32:03.990 --> 00:32:07.980
of your first impressions going
with your father to matches

00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:10.960
was how unhappy all
the people seemed.

00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:11.710
NICK HORNBY: Yeah.

00:32:11.710 --> 00:32:15.660
MALE SPEAKER: So for a writer
who is unhappy with the process

00:32:15.660 --> 00:32:20.130
to then go to relax at a
match, it sounds miserable.

00:32:20.130 --> 00:32:23.020
NICK HORNBY: It all fits in.

00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:25.650
MALE SPEAKER: I'm sorry, your
life sounded terribly unhappy.

00:32:25.650 --> 00:32:29.810
NICK HORNBY: It's all-- I mean
the thing about the football,

00:32:29.810 --> 00:32:35.220
one of the things that impressed
me about it was how seriously

00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:39.520
people took their fun, and
that's something that has been

00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:43.550
important to me my entire
life, whether you're listening

00:32:43.550 --> 00:32:48.520
seriously to music or reading
seriously or watching movies

00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:51.580
seriously and writing
movies seriously.

00:32:51.580 --> 00:32:53.950
The things that set
those people apart

00:32:53.950 --> 00:32:57.290
are that they are willing to
take something, apparently

00:32:57.290 --> 00:32:59.410
trivial, very, very
seriously, indeed,

00:32:59.410 --> 00:33:03.210
and I always liked
those people the most.

00:33:03.210 --> 00:33:05.290
MALE SPEAKER: No,
I can see that.

00:33:05.290 --> 00:33:07.290
Just "High Fidelity,"
for instance.

00:33:07.290 --> 00:33:08.720
NICK HORNBY: Exactly.

00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:13.160
I think I don't trust people who
don't have some kind of passion

00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:17.624
outside work or who have made
their passion their work.

00:33:17.624 --> 00:33:19.290
MALE SPEAKER: I can
definitely see that.

00:33:19.290 --> 00:33:23.160
NICK HORNBY: That's why I don't
like politicians, I think.

00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:25.190
The only thing they seem
to be bothered about

00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:30.580
is politics and not the
outside world of politics,

00:33:30.580 --> 00:33:33.570
but the inside
world of politics.

00:33:33.570 --> 00:33:35.910
They tend not to know a
great deal about anything

00:33:35.910 --> 00:33:38.320
that I'm interested in.

00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:39.820
MALE SPEAKER: Well,
maybe in the UK.

00:33:39.820 --> 00:33:43.480
In the US, our politicians are
incredibly well-rounded people

00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:46.950
who are very well-informed
about everything.

00:33:46.950 --> 00:33:48.551
I'm sorry about your
own politicians.

00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:57.460
So you started off,
obviously, writing a memoir,

00:33:57.460 --> 00:34:00.270
and then actually
moved to screenwriting

00:34:00.270 --> 00:34:02.920
before writing novels.

00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:04.430
Do you feel comfortable?

00:34:04.430 --> 00:34:06.570
And obviously you've
written criticism

00:34:06.570 --> 00:34:09.530
along the way, reviews.

00:34:09.530 --> 00:34:12.159
Do you feel comfortable
moving back and forth

00:34:12.159 --> 00:34:13.639
among the different forms?

00:34:13.639 --> 00:34:17.050
Do you have to sort of,
oh, I finished this.

00:34:17.050 --> 00:34:21.080
Now I'm going to go do my
monthly book review now.

00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:23.690
Is it sort of a seamless
transition for you?

00:34:23.690 --> 00:34:25.630
Do you have to sort
of catch your breath?

00:34:28.659 --> 00:34:31.090
NICK HORNBY: Well, it's
a seamless transition

00:34:31.090 --> 00:34:33.900
between fiction and
nonfiction and prose.

00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:37.730
I don't find that
much of an issue.

00:34:37.730 --> 00:34:42.760
The switch between screenwriting
and prose, I think, is hard,

00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:46.852
and it takes awhile to adjust.

00:34:46.852 --> 00:34:48.310
Not so much going
to screenwriting,

00:34:48.310 --> 00:34:50.960
but going from
screenwriting to prose,

00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:57.950
and I think there's something
about the brevity of the form

00:34:57.950 --> 00:35:01.140
with screenwriting that can
damage prose a little bit,

00:35:01.140 --> 00:35:07.430
because even though it's good
to be economical with words,

00:35:07.430 --> 00:35:11.440
you still can't write 90 pages
with not much writing on them,

00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:12.790
and hope that that's a novel.

00:35:12.790 --> 00:35:13.680
It isn't.

00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:17.200
You do have to expand and
think about the things

00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:20.030
that people aren't seeing
or that they don't know,

00:35:20.030 --> 00:35:24.630
and with screenwriting,
you can hope

00:35:24.630 --> 00:35:26.470
that the actors and the
director and the set

00:35:26.470 --> 00:35:31.300
designer and the art department
can provide the things

00:35:31.300 --> 00:35:34.280
that you're not
including in your script,

00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:37.015
but you have to do it all
yourself with fiction.

00:35:37.015 --> 00:35:42.850
And I think it is
a jump back in.

00:35:42.850 --> 00:35:46.670
I always seem to prefer the
one I'm not doing at the time.

00:35:46.670 --> 00:35:49.367
That probably fits in with the
miserable football [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:49.367 --> 00:35:50.200
MALE SPEAKER: Right.

00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:52.390
More misery, I was just
going to say, more misery.

00:35:52.390 --> 00:35:54.300
Sure.

00:35:54.300 --> 00:36:00.150
So I'm also fascinated by the
book reviewing and the reading

00:36:00.150 --> 00:36:00.890
part of that.

00:36:00.890 --> 00:36:04.580
In addition to being a
prolific writer yourself,

00:36:04.580 --> 00:36:08.410
you're obviously a
fairly voracious reader,

00:36:08.410 --> 00:36:11.810
except when you're
not, and your reviews

00:36:11.810 --> 00:36:14.550
have been collected
several times.

00:36:14.550 --> 00:36:17.175
Do you consider
yourself a bibliophile,

00:36:17.175 --> 00:36:19.180
or do you just love to read?

00:36:19.180 --> 00:36:21.885
I mean, to me, there's
a slight distinction.

00:36:21.885 --> 00:36:23.510
NICK HORNBY: A
bibliophile in the sense

00:36:23.510 --> 00:36:26.290
of wanting to possess books?

00:36:26.290 --> 00:36:27.990
Expensive books?

00:36:27.990 --> 00:36:28.990
MALE SPEAKER: Any books.

00:36:28.990 --> 00:36:29.840
I'm a bibliophile.

00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:32.470
This is why I ask.

00:36:32.470 --> 00:36:38.010
NICK HORNBY: I love the
object, and before I came here,

00:36:38.010 --> 00:36:41.840
I was traveling around
the library at Harvard.

00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:45.970
I had an invitation to go
and see some of their stuff,

00:36:45.970 --> 00:36:51.690
and I mean, it's sort of
jaw-dropping what they've got

00:36:51.690 --> 00:36:55.930
there, and I was looking at
Dickens's letter opener and his

00:36:55.930 --> 00:37:00.620
walking stick and the notebook
that George Eliot used to make

00:37:00.620 --> 00:37:05.341
notes for "Middlemarch," and
I didn't-- it was really cool

00:37:05.341 --> 00:37:05.840
to see.

00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:11.800
I didn't covet it,
and my book collection

00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:13.880
is now a book
collection, but partly

00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:16.500
because as you get
older, you realize

00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:19.800
that books you bought 20
years ago when they came out

00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:22.090
were, as it were,
first editions,

00:37:22.090 --> 00:37:25.490
and you only read them once,
and you've kept them nicely.

00:37:25.490 --> 00:37:28.660
Oh, and you went to see the
author read, and he signed it,

00:37:28.660 --> 00:37:31.240
and that author's now dead.

00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:34.250
And slowly, you
have a collection

00:37:34.250 --> 00:37:35.745
that's worth something.

00:37:35.745 --> 00:37:39.610
I went to see Raymond Carver
read on a Saturday afternoon

00:37:39.610 --> 00:37:42.510
at a paperback bookshop
in the Fulham Road,

00:37:42.510 --> 00:37:47.040
and it was so crappily
done that they didn't even

00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:49.180
close the store.

00:37:49.180 --> 00:37:50.560
Raymond Carver
was trying to read

00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:53.820
above the sound of these
braying Chelsea women trying

00:37:53.820 --> 00:37:58.550
to buy the new Jeffrey Archer
novel and saying, who's that?

00:37:58.550 --> 00:37:59.490
Who's that over there?

00:37:59.490 --> 00:38:01.190
But he signed my book.

00:38:01.190 --> 00:38:02.640
Raymond Carver wrote, "To Nick.

00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:04.300
Best wishes, Ray Carver."

00:38:04.300 --> 00:38:07.530
And of course, I
kept it, and I don't

00:38:07.530 --> 00:38:10.250
know if that makes
me a bibliophile.

00:38:10.250 --> 00:38:12.090
Is that a bibliophile?

00:38:12.090 --> 00:38:14.870
MALE SPEAKER: By some
definition, by some definition.

00:38:14.870 --> 00:38:20.920
NICK HORNBY: Not in the sense
that I scour catalogs and bid

00:38:20.920 --> 00:38:24.870
for items on eBay or
anything like that.

00:38:24.870 --> 00:38:27.560
But I do love books
as objects, yeah.

00:38:27.560 --> 00:38:29.790
MALE SPEAKER: Right.

00:38:29.790 --> 00:38:33.270
In terms of the
reading itself, I

00:38:33.270 --> 00:38:36.740
know I've met some writers
who say, I'm writing a book.

00:38:36.740 --> 00:38:39.290
I'm in the last six
weeks of a book.

00:38:39.290 --> 00:38:43.420
I can't read anything else,
because I'll be too influenced

00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:47.720
by this book style or the
narrative tone or whatever.

00:38:47.720 --> 00:38:50.080
Do you find that
yourself, or can you

00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:51.780
just read while you're writing?

00:38:51.780 --> 00:38:55.610
NICK HORNBY: I think
those people-- well,

00:38:55.610 --> 00:38:57.676
I won't be rude about them.

00:38:57.676 --> 00:38:58.800
MALE SPEAKER: No, go ahead.

00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:02.750
NICK HORNBY: I mean if I think
a novel, if I'm writing a novel,

00:39:02.750 --> 00:39:05.190
and I pick up a
novel by somebody

00:39:05.190 --> 00:39:08.730
who I think might be
tonally similar to me

00:39:08.730 --> 00:39:12.070
or writing in a
similar narrative area,

00:39:12.070 --> 00:39:13.270
then I won't touch it.

00:39:13.270 --> 00:39:21.390
But given what's left, like the
whole of human literature, no.

00:39:21.390 --> 00:39:22.970
Of course, I read.

00:39:22.970 --> 00:39:26.290
I'm really conscious of how
many years I have left to me,

00:39:26.290 --> 00:39:30.240
and I want to read as
much as I possibly can,

00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:32.190
but I read a lot of nonfiction.

00:39:32.190 --> 00:39:33.790
I read books about music.

00:39:33.790 --> 00:39:34.930
I read books about sport.

00:39:34.930 --> 00:39:36.330
I read books about books.

00:39:36.330 --> 00:39:42.050
And none of these things
come into the process

00:39:42.050 --> 00:39:45.360
of my own writing
while I'm writing.

00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:48.460
My thing is off on
its own path by then,

00:39:48.460 --> 00:39:54.495
and I couldn't bear
not to read, no.

00:39:54.495 --> 00:39:55.620
MALE SPEAKER: That's great.

00:39:55.620 --> 00:39:57.870
Compulsive [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:57.870 --> 00:39:58.738
Love that.

00:40:01.950 --> 00:40:05.125
And music, obviously, a
big part of your life.

00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:11.090
It's actually hard to believe
your passion for football

00:40:11.090 --> 00:40:15.100
has left room for another
equally big passion, which

00:40:15.100 --> 00:40:17.830
obviously is music.

00:40:17.830 --> 00:40:19.770
You've written for
"The New Yorker."

00:40:19.770 --> 00:40:27.830
You've written 31 songs, which,
surprisingly, for some reason,

00:40:27.830 --> 00:40:31.120
I'll say the following,
because just as an American,

00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:32.960
I've always connected
the two of you

00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:36.720
even though you've probably
never met John Peel.

00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:40.840
He was unimpressed by 31
songs, I think, and only

00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:45.040
because you're both such soccer,
or sorry-- football fanatics--

00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:46.150
and you both love music.

00:40:46.150 --> 00:40:49.340
I thought you must've been great
friends, although you probably

00:40:49.340 --> 00:40:50.084
never even met.

00:40:50.084 --> 00:40:50.750
NICK HORNBY: No.

00:40:50.750 --> 00:40:52.410
I didn't meet him, actually, no.

00:40:52.410 --> 00:40:53.660
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:40:53.660 --> 00:40:59.500
But anyway, John Peel aside,
you also write lyrics for songs.

00:40:59.500 --> 00:41:04.670
You're a great supporter of
particular bands, apparently

00:41:04.670 --> 00:41:11.690
one of the world's great experts
on mix tapes, making mix tapes.

00:41:11.690 --> 00:41:13.270
What about music?

00:41:13.270 --> 00:41:15.740
It's obviously played a
huge role in your life.

00:41:15.740 --> 00:41:16.510
NICK HORNBY: Yeah.

00:41:16.510 --> 00:41:22.530
Well, there's a great quote
by the critic, Walter Pater,

00:41:22.530 --> 00:41:25.980
that said all art aspires
towards the condition of music.

00:41:25.980 --> 00:41:31.830
And I do think it's the
most sophisticated form

00:41:31.830 --> 00:41:38.320
of self-expression that somebody
who is able to express emotion

00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:41.460
through music is really
getting the job done, I think,

00:41:41.460 --> 00:41:45.970
because there's such
emotional precision in music

00:41:45.970 --> 00:41:50.020
that you can't really hope
to match with words or paint

00:41:50.020 --> 00:41:51.600
or anything else.

00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:55.680
And when I write,
it's all the music

00:41:55.680 --> 00:42:00.310
I love coming out in
word form, so music

00:42:00.310 --> 00:42:04.650
goes in as some kind
of petrol, as gasoline,

00:42:04.650 --> 00:42:09.230
and then comes out as
prose or a screenplay.

00:42:09.230 --> 00:42:12.660
So it's a constant inspiration,
and the opposite to sport,

00:42:12.660 --> 00:42:15.810
actually, because it
only makes me happy.

00:42:15.810 --> 00:42:18.960
And if I'm listening
to sad music,

00:42:18.960 --> 00:42:23.090
it's not by accident, whereas
if I'm made sad by football,

00:42:23.090 --> 00:42:25.595
it's always by accident.

00:42:25.595 --> 00:42:27.880
There's sport-- you
start with great hope,

00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:31.740
and then you're destroyed
by the results of your team.

00:42:31.740 --> 00:42:36.630
And the is only ever
pleasure, and, of course,

00:42:36.630 --> 00:42:40.240
fits into so many parts of life.

00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:45.540
Sport is once or twice a week
and endless conversations,

00:42:45.540 --> 00:42:48.970
but music is when
I'm walking to work,

00:42:48.970 --> 00:42:50.660
when I'm taking a
break from work,

00:42:50.660 --> 00:42:52.820
when I'm sitting on a plane.

00:42:52.820 --> 00:42:56.165
It comes into every area.

00:42:56.165 --> 00:42:57.530
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:42:57.530 --> 00:43:00.260
Do you listen to music
while you work, or do you--

00:43:00.260 --> 00:43:01.830
NICK HORNBY: No.

00:43:01.830 --> 00:43:03.620
Certainly not music with words.

00:43:06.310 --> 00:43:10.640
I just find it too
busy, so it's-- no.

00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:13.605
It tops me up in
between bits of writing.

00:43:15.731 --> 00:43:17.230
MALE SPEAKER:
Pleasure in your life.

00:43:17.230 --> 00:43:18.320
NICK HORNBY: Yes.

00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:20.350
You found it.

00:43:20.350 --> 00:43:26.010
MALE SPEAKER: So there's been
a long, raging debate in the US

00:43:26.010 --> 00:43:30.510
about the merits of digital
music versus vinyl, which

00:43:30.510 --> 00:43:32.970
is actually, in this
country at least,

00:43:32.970 --> 00:43:36.910
in a renaissance among
younger fans and bands.

00:43:36.910 --> 00:43:39.820
Has there been a similar
debate in the UK?

00:43:39.820 --> 00:43:44.410
And if so, where do you stand
on this important question?

00:43:44.410 --> 00:43:46.870
NICK HORNBY: Well,
I'm right on-- I

00:43:46.870 --> 00:43:49.850
seem to be-- my life
seems to have exemplified

00:43:49.850 --> 00:43:54.680
the argument in
that about a year

00:43:54.680 --> 00:43:59.900
or so ago, I was-- I'm
not a purist about music.

00:43:59.900 --> 00:44:00.820
Same with books.

00:44:00.820 --> 00:44:02.680
I just want the
stuff, and I don't

00:44:02.680 --> 00:44:06.710
mind what form it comes
in, and I love my iPod,

00:44:06.710 --> 00:44:10.650
and I love my iPod Classic, and
I'm really sorry that the iPod

00:44:10.650 --> 00:44:15.410
Classic's been discontinued,
but I was scrolling through it

00:44:15.410 --> 00:44:17.160
and looking at
some of the stuff.

00:44:17.160 --> 00:44:19.580
And I think, I don't know
who the hell this person is.

00:44:19.580 --> 00:44:21.620
I don't know why
I downloaded it.

00:44:21.620 --> 00:44:23.850
I don't know what it belongs to.

00:44:23.850 --> 00:44:25.400
I'm going to play some of it.

00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:25.900
Oh.

00:44:25.900 --> 00:44:27.520
It's terrible.

00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:30.320
I'm going to 5 seconds of it
and move onto the next thing.

00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:33.060
And there was so much
of that in my life,

00:44:33.060 --> 00:44:37.480
where I wasn't committed
to this person I

00:44:37.480 --> 00:44:39.200
didn't know in the first place.

00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:45.590
And especially if you work at
a computer all day on your own,

00:44:45.590 --> 00:44:48.550
and no one's going to
spot what you're doing,

00:44:48.550 --> 00:44:51.940
I spent a lot of time
surfing, finding new music,

00:44:51.940 --> 00:44:55.880
downloading someone's
playlist that they've put on,

00:44:55.880 --> 00:44:59.610
not listening to it, going
on for a bit more to download

00:44:59.610 --> 00:45:01.770
someone else's, and
so on and so forth.

00:45:01.770 --> 00:45:03.380
Anyway, I got to
the point where I

00:45:03.380 --> 00:45:06.720
thought I'm going to
start buying vinyl again,

00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:11.130
because you have
to go someplace.

00:45:11.130 --> 00:45:13.540
You can't have turntables
all over your house.

00:45:13.540 --> 00:45:16.670
There's one place in your house
where you have a turntable,

00:45:16.670 --> 00:45:19.450
and you can't keep
skipping the tracks,

00:45:19.450 --> 00:45:22.310
and I'm going to sit
down and listen to it.

00:45:22.310 --> 00:45:24.490
At least give it that
much-- 20 minutes,

00:45:24.490 --> 00:45:26.230
and pay some money for it.

00:45:26.230 --> 00:45:29.930
Because I knew vinyl,
and it's not cheap.

00:45:29.930 --> 00:45:34.110
It's like 20 pounds for
an album in England,

00:45:34.110 --> 00:45:35.850
between 15 and 20 pounds.

00:45:35.850 --> 00:45:37.430
To buy an album,
you have to think

00:45:37.430 --> 00:45:40.340
about what it is you
want to listen to

00:45:40.340 --> 00:45:41.737
at that kind of price.

00:45:41.737 --> 00:45:43.320
And once you've
bought it, you give it

00:45:43.320 --> 00:45:45.900
the courtesy of
some time, which I

00:45:45.900 --> 00:45:49.010
wasn't doing with
digital music at all.

00:45:49.010 --> 00:45:51.840
Set against that, in
the last two months,

00:45:51.840 --> 00:45:55.790
I've become an
obsessive Spotify user,

00:45:55.790 --> 00:46:01.040
because I didn't understand
properly what Spotify could be

00:46:01.040 --> 00:46:01.930
or did.

00:46:01.930 --> 00:46:06.790
And as a consequence,
I've been more

00:46:06.790 --> 00:46:09.740
experimental with
my music, come out

00:46:09.740 --> 00:46:12.450
of my comfort zone a lot
more, because I'm not

00:46:12.450 --> 00:46:16.070
committed financially or going
to commit myself financially.

00:46:16.070 --> 00:46:20.170
So I've kind of become more
educated through Spotify.

00:46:20.170 --> 00:46:23.490
So I think my position
now is, I'm not

00:46:23.490 --> 00:46:26.900
going to use iTunes anymore,
apart from what I've already

00:46:26.900 --> 00:46:27.740
got.

00:46:27.740 --> 00:46:30.500
It will be Spotify and
vinyl, and that's it.

00:46:30.500 --> 00:46:31.350
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:46:31.350 --> 00:46:34.260
Unlike you, I don't
have a good enough ear

00:46:34.260 --> 00:46:38.170
to have a position one way
or the other, digital versus

00:46:38.170 --> 00:46:38.970
vinyl.

00:46:38.970 --> 00:46:42.280
NICK HORNBY: In terms of
the actual sound quality?

00:46:42.280 --> 00:46:42.916
Yeah.

00:46:42.916 --> 00:46:44.040
MALE SPEAKER: Maybe you do.

00:46:44.040 --> 00:46:44.600
I don't know.

00:46:44.600 --> 00:46:47.330
NICK HORNBY: I don't think I do.

00:46:47.330 --> 00:46:51.470
I think I kid myself when I
listen to vinyl that I can hear

00:46:51.470 --> 00:46:55.420
something that's richer,
and T Bone Burnett,

00:46:55.420 --> 00:46:58.470
who I was talking
to recently, says

00:46:58.470 --> 00:47:02.420
he's got it set up
in his studio that he

00:47:02.420 --> 00:47:05.465
has a digital recording
and an analog recording

00:47:05.465 --> 00:47:07.290
of the same piece of music.

00:47:07.290 --> 00:47:09.610
And he says that when
he plays it to people,

00:47:09.610 --> 00:47:11.580
they literally cannot
believe the difference.

00:47:11.580 --> 00:47:14.600
They can't even believe
it's the same record.

00:47:14.600 --> 00:47:18.130
But I don't have a
sound system where

00:47:18.130 --> 00:47:22.530
it seems to me to make
a marked difference.

00:47:22.530 --> 00:47:25.250
So it's not really
about the sound quality.

00:47:25.250 --> 00:47:29.070
It's about the
commitment to the music.

00:47:29.070 --> 00:47:30.570
MALE SPEAKER: I
have to say, for me,

00:47:30.570 --> 00:47:34.990
there's something about
vinyl that I think Rob talks

00:47:34.990 --> 00:47:38.520
about in the context of
making the perfect mix tape.

00:47:38.520 --> 00:47:42.520
And to me on vinyl, that
specifically the transition

00:47:42.520 --> 00:47:46.662
from the last song on side one
to the first song on side two.

00:47:46.662 --> 00:47:47.412
NICK HORNBY: Yeah.

00:47:47.412 --> 00:47:48.710
MALE SPEAKER: You know
what I'm talking about.

00:47:48.710 --> 00:47:48.990
NICK HORNBY: Yeah.

00:47:48.990 --> 00:47:50.781
MALE SPEAKER: Because
the last long on side

00:47:50.781 --> 00:47:52.350
one is usually a crescendo.

00:47:52.350 --> 00:47:55.300
You're ending a side
pretty much with a bang.

00:47:55.300 --> 00:48:00.760
The second song on side two--
sort of starting off very easy.

00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:03.600
But I love that transition
from that one song

00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:08.670
to the other, which we've
really lost with digital.

00:48:08.670 --> 00:48:12.872
NICK HORNBY: Well, the thing
with them making playlists

00:48:12.872 --> 00:48:14.580
is that you're not
listening to the music

00:48:14.580 --> 00:48:19.150
as you're doing it, whereas
if you make a mix tape,

00:48:19.150 --> 00:48:24.180
there wasn't on analog,
with vinyl to cassette type,

00:48:24.180 --> 00:48:26.790
there wasn't anything to be
done while you were doing it

00:48:26.790 --> 00:48:28.757
apart from listening
to the song.

00:48:28.757 --> 00:48:30.840
And of course, while you're
spending three or four

00:48:30.840 --> 00:48:33.770
minutes listening to a
song, then you're thinking,

00:48:33.770 --> 00:48:37.650
oh, that guitar solo
sounds like that,

00:48:37.650 --> 00:48:40.040
or this lyric
reminds me of that.

00:48:40.040 --> 00:48:42.480
And so while you're
listening to the song,

00:48:42.480 --> 00:48:44.540
it gives you maybe
four or five choices

00:48:44.540 --> 00:48:48.050
for the next song, which
are more considered choices,

00:48:48.050 --> 00:48:51.030
whereas if you're doing a
playlist here-- blip, blip,

00:48:51.030 --> 00:48:54.990
blip, blip, blip-- you haven't
got any of the sound of that.

00:48:54.990 --> 00:48:57.775
You can remember the record, but
you haven't got the actual feel

00:48:57.775 --> 00:49:00.310
or sound in your head
while you're doing it.

00:49:00.310 --> 00:49:03.419
So I think, by definition,
they have to be inferior.

00:49:03.419 --> 00:49:04.210
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:49:04.210 --> 00:49:04.710
No.

00:49:04.710 --> 00:49:05.900
I totally agree.

00:49:05.900 --> 00:49:08.180
I still have dozens
of mix tapes at home

00:49:08.180 --> 00:49:13.910
that other people made
for me or that I made.

00:49:13.910 --> 00:49:17.550
So I honestly wish we
could talk for hours,

00:49:17.550 --> 00:49:22.220
but we can't, and you're here to
talk about "Funny Girl," which

00:49:22.220 --> 00:49:24.080
I think is just been
published today?

00:49:24.080 --> 00:49:25.652
NICK HORNBY: It's today, yes.

00:49:25.652 --> 00:49:27.110
MALE SPEAKER: First
ones to get it.

00:49:30.490 --> 00:49:33.180
I turn it over to
you and the book.

00:49:33.180 --> 00:49:35.860
What should your fans
know about this book?

00:49:35.860 --> 00:49:37.820
What do you want to
tell us about it?

00:49:37.820 --> 00:49:40.000
NICK HORNBY: Well,
I mean it really

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:43.630
comes from having spent a
lot of the last three or four

00:49:43.630 --> 00:49:50.120
years writing for screen, and
after "An Education," I also

00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:57.055
adapted Colm Toibin's
"Brooklyn," and it got stuck,

00:49:57.055 --> 00:50:00.180
and then unstuck, and then the
funding collapsed, and then

00:50:00.180 --> 00:50:02.900
a director left, and then a
director came, and it's just

00:50:02.900 --> 00:50:05.120
the normal process of film.

00:50:05.120 --> 00:50:08.640
And it showed at
Sundance last week,

00:50:08.640 --> 00:50:11.690
finally, after
four or five years.

00:50:11.690 --> 00:50:14.320
And I write a series
for HBO, which

00:50:14.320 --> 00:50:16.770
is they commissioned a pilot.

00:50:16.770 --> 00:50:18.420
Then they didn't
commission the series,

00:50:18.420 --> 00:50:22.810
and I wrote "Wild"
for Reese Witherspoon,

00:50:22.810 --> 00:50:24.990
and that got made
really quickly.

00:50:24.990 --> 00:50:28.560
And they were two things
about all these experiences.

00:50:28.560 --> 00:50:34.600
One, the experience of
working collaboratively

00:50:34.600 --> 00:50:38.760
with really smart,
clever people, and two,

00:50:38.760 --> 00:50:42.970
the frustrations when
it doesn't get anywhere.

00:50:42.970 --> 00:50:47.230
And the big thing
about screenwriting

00:50:47.230 --> 00:50:49.310
is that you need
permission all the time.

00:50:49.310 --> 00:50:51.450
We were talking about
the money before,

00:50:51.450 --> 00:50:55.140
but there were about
25 gatekeepers.

00:50:55.140 --> 00:50:59.427
So you write a script,
and you need a cast for it

00:50:59.427 --> 00:51:00.010
to be a movie.

00:51:00.010 --> 00:51:00.880
You need a director.

00:51:00.880 --> 00:51:01.630
You need money.

00:51:01.630 --> 00:51:03.100
You need an editor.

00:51:03.100 --> 00:51:04.930
You need this, this, this, this.

00:51:04.930 --> 00:51:08.450
And your work, your script
is not a finished thing.

00:51:08.450 --> 00:51:09.770
Your script is a script.

00:51:09.770 --> 00:51:10.690
That's all it is.

00:51:10.690 --> 00:51:12.100
It's not a movie.

00:51:12.100 --> 00:51:16.700
And you can't give it to
someone and say, read my script,

00:51:16.700 --> 00:51:19.240
unless they're used to the
idea of reading scripts,

00:51:19.240 --> 00:51:24.130
whereas with a novel, if you
have finished it, it's a novel.

00:51:24.130 --> 00:51:26.540
It doesn't matter if
nobody publishes it.

00:51:26.540 --> 00:51:29.420
It doesn't matter if nobody
buys it in a bookstore.

00:51:29.420 --> 00:51:30.160
It is a novel.

00:51:30.160 --> 00:51:33.190
It's its own thing.

00:51:33.190 --> 00:51:36.130
Anyway, I wanted to write
about the experience of working

00:51:36.130 --> 00:51:39.370
collaboratively, and I wanted
to write about in novel form,

00:51:39.370 --> 00:51:42.440
because I was sick of
all the permissions

00:51:42.440 --> 00:51:43.370
and the gatekeepers.

00:51:43.370 --> 00:51:47.520
So this novel is about
the birth, life, and death

00:51:47.520 --> 00:51:51.220
of a fictional sitcom, and
it's about clever people

00:51:51.220 --> 00:51:54.740
working at the top of their
game and having fun and being

00:51:54.740 --> 00:51:58.440
unable to stay there, because
no band or collaborative

00:51:58.440 --> 00:52:03.550
team can ever stay
permanently wedded forever,

00:52:03.550 --> 00:52:07.070
even though when we love their
work, we wish they could.

00:52:07.070 --> 00:52:10.090
So it's about the funny
girl, and the title

00:52:10.090 --> 00:52:13.200
is the star of this
sitcom and her costar

00:52:13.200 --> 00:52:16.915
and the two writers
and the producer.

00:52:16.915 --> 00:52:18.185
MALE SPEAKER: Oh, OK.

00:52:18.185 --> 00:52:19.810
NICK HORNBY: And it's
set in the 1960s,

00:52:19.810 --> 00:52:23.120
because I wanted to write
about the characters old now

00:52:23.120 --> 00:52:26.030
at the end.

00:52:26.030 --> 00:52:29.320
MALE SPEAKER: And possibly
inspired by Lucille Ball,

00:52:29.320 --> 00:52:29.870
I've read.

00:52:29.870 --> 00:52:30.620
NICK HORNBY: Yeah.

00:52:30.620 --> 00:52:34.990
Well, the character is
inspired by Lucille Ball.

00:52:34.990 --> 00:52:37.290
The novel, not particularly.

00:52:37.290 --> 00:52:41.740
But she wanted-- this
character wants to be funny,

00:52:41.740 --> 00:52:43.715
and she doesn't have
any other role models.

00:52:43.715 --> 00:52:45.990
It was quite strange
about England

00:52:45.990 --> 00:52:49.430
that our comedy actually
was so masculine.

00:52:49.430 --> 00:52:52.890
If you look at something
like "Monty Python,"

00:52:52.890 --> 00:52:55.270
there were no women
apart from some women

00:52:55.270 --> 00:52:58.760
who ran around in bikinis
at strategic points

00:52:58.760 --> 00:53:00.290
in the program.

00:53:00.290 --> 00:53:02.740
And we had "Steptoe
and Son" which

00:53:02.740 --> 00:53:05.064
became "Sanford
and Son," two men.

00:53:05.064 --> 00:53:07.230
And we had a program called
"The Likely Lads," which

00:53:07.230 --> 00:53:10.110
was two men, and it was
very male-dominated.

00:53:10.110 --> 00:53:14.290
So there's an element of sort
of alternative reality in this

00:53:14.290 --> 00:53:19.410
that it's a female
comedienne at that time.

00:53:19.410 --> 00:53:22.170
MALE SPEAKER: And would you like
to read something from it, or--

00:53:22.170 --> 00:53:22.920
NICK HORNBY: Sure.

00:53:25.010 --> 00:53:31.320
I'm going to read
about the two writers.

00:53:31.320 --> 00:53:32.950
"Tony Holmes and
Bill Gardner met

00:53:32.950 --> 00:53:35.770
in a holding cell in a
police station in Aldershot

00:53:35.770 --> 00:53:39.300
the week before
Christmas in 1959.

00:53:39.300 --> 00:53:41.630
The local police wanted
the military police

00:53:41.630 --> 00:53:43.690
to take them back
to the barracks.

00:53:43.690 --> 00:53:47.080
The military police didn't
want anything to do with them.

00:53:47.080 --> 00:53:49.810
While the two sets of
authorities wrangled,

00:53:49.810 --> 00:53:53.290
they sat there for 24
hours talking, smoking,

00:53:53.290 --> 00:53:58.130
and not sleeping, both of them
feeling stupid and very afraid.

00:53:58.130 --> 00:54:00.160
They ascertained that
they'd both in arrested

00:54:00.160 --> 00:54:04.490
in the same place in the
same street two hours apart.

00:54:04.490 --> 00:54:07.740
They didn't even tell each other
what they'd been doing wrong

00:54:07.740 --> 00:54:10.340
or where precisely
they'd been doing it.

00:54:10.340 --> 00:54:11.660
They didn't need to.

00:54:11.660 --> 00:54:14.270
They just knew.

00:54:14.270 --> 00:54:17.430
Neither of them had ever been
caught back at home in London,

00:54:17.430 --> 00:54:19.510
but for different reasons.

00:54:19.510 --> 00:54:21.730
Bill hadn't been caught,
because he was smart

00:54:21.730 --> 00:54:24.510
and knew the places to go,
the clubs and the bars,

00:54:24.510 --> 00:54:26.590
and even the public
conveniences,

00:54:26.590 --> 00:54:29.200
although he didn't
use them very often.

00:54:29.200 --> 00:54:32.220
The evening's events
had reminded him why.

00:54:32.220 --> 00:54:34.380
The policeman who'd
arrested him in Aldershot

00:54:34.380 --> 00:54:37.130
may well have been an
agent provocateur, one

00:54:37.130 --> 00:54:39.920
of those officers who
hated his kind with such

00:54:39.920 --> 00:54:43.150
a peculiar and obsessive
passion that they were prepared

00:54:43.150 --> 00:54:46.420
to spend entire evenings
trying to catch them.

00:54:46.420 --> 00:54:48.900
There were plenty of
them in London too.

00:54:48.900 --> 00:54:50.600
Tony had never been
caught in London,

00:54:50.600 --> 00:54:53.000
because he'd never tried
anything in London,

00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:55.090
or anywhere else
for that matter.

00:54:55.090 --> 00:54:57.150
He wasn't sure about
a lots of things,

00:54:57.150 --> 00:54:59.170
including who and
what he was, but he

00:54:59.170 --> 00:55:03.100
had no clear idea why he
decided to try and find

00:55:03.100 --> 00:55:05.250
the answers to these
questions right

00:55:05.250 --> 00:55:07.870
before the end of
his national service.

00:55:07.870 --> 00:55:10.860
Loneliness, certainly,
and boredom,

00:55:10.860 --> 00:55:12.930
and the sudden desperate
need for the touch

00:55:12.930 --> 00:55:16.520
of a fellow human being of
any gender, though admittedly,

00:55:16.520 --> 00:55:19.010
he was only likely to
find one of the two

00:55:19.010 --> 00:55:22.970
in the gents' toilets
in Tennyson Street.

00:55:22.970 --> 00:55:26.090
In the end, nobody had the
stomach to prosecute them,

00:55:26.090 --> 00:55:28.310
and the following day, they
returned to the barracks

00:55:28.310 --> 00:55:31.440
to complete the rest of
their national service.

00:55:31.440 --> 00:55:33.670
Whenever they looked back
on that evening, which

00:55:33.670 --> 00:55:35.760
they did frequently,
although never together

00:55:35.760 --> 00:55:37.910
and never out loud,
there wasn't much

00:55:37.910 --> 00:55:41.920
that they recognized about the
circumstances of their arrest.

00:55:41.920 --> 00:55:43.690
Had they really been
desperate enough

00:55:43.690 --> 00:55:47.520
to get so near to humiliation
and possible ruin?

00:55:47.520 --> 00:55:50.440
But the contents of their
24-hour conversation

00:55:50.440 --> 00:55:54.260
stayed reassuring and
familiar, even years later.

00:55:54.260 --> 00:55:56.450
They talked about comedy.

00:55:56.450 --> 00:55:58.250
They discovered
their mutual passion

00:55:58.250 --> 00:56:02.000
for Ray Galton and Alan Simpson
within minutes of meeting.

00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:04.830
They could quote whole
chunks of Hancock's Half Hour

00:56:04.830 --> 00:56:07.850
to each other, and they tried to
remember as much as they could

00:56:07.850 --> 00:56:11.270
of "The Blood Donor" so
that they could perform it.

00:56:11.270 --> 00:56:14.150
They were pretty sure they were
word perfect on the hospital

00:56:14.150 --> 00:56:17.460
scene, with Bill playing Hancock
and Tony with the higher,

00:56:17.460 --> 00:56:21.730
more nasal voice taking
on the Hugh Lloyd part.

00:56:21.730 --> 00:56:24.320
They kept in touch when
they were demobbed.

00:56:24.320 --> 00:56:27.200
Tony lived in East London and
then Bill was up in Barnet,

00:56:27.200 --> 00:56:30.550
so they used to meet in
town in a Soho coffee bar

00:56:30.550 --> 00:56:33.100
once a week, at first, when
they were both still working

00:56:33.100 --> 00:56:35.640
in the jobs they were
trying to escape.

00:56:35.640 --> 00:56:38.730
Tony was helping his father
in the news agency he owned.

00:56:38.730 --> 00:56:42.220
Bill was a pen pusher at
the Department of Transport.

00:56:42.220 --> 00:56:44.460
They spent the first
few months talking,

00:56:44.460 --> 00:56:46.860
and then eventually
overcame their embarrassment

00:56:46.860 --> 00:56:50.690
and started trying to write
together on two notepads.

00:56:50.690 --> 00:56:53.540
Later, when they took the
leap into unemployment,

00:56:53.540 --> 00:56:56.200
they met every day in
the same coffee bar

00:56:56.200 --> 00:56:58.540
and would continue
to do so until they

00:56:58.540 --> 00:57:00.880
could afford an office.

00:57:00.880 --> 00:57:03.650
They never talked about the
other thing they may or may not

00:57:03.650 --> 00:57:05.840
have had in common,
but Bill was still

00:57:05.840 --> 00:57:08.550
shocked when Tony got married.

00:57:08.550 --> 00:57:11.540
He'd never even
mentioned seeing someone.

00:57:11.540 --> 00:57:13.495
Bill went to the wedding,
and Tony's bride,

00:57:13.495 --> 00:57:16.095
a sweet, quiet, clever
brunette called June

00:57:16.095 --> 00:57:18.490
who worked at the
BBC, seemed to know

00:57:18.490 --> 00:57:20.080
all about her
husband's partners,

00:57:20.080 --> 00:57:23.630
or as much as she would
have wanted to know anyway.

00:57:23.630 --> 00:57:27.190
And maybe there wasn't
anything else to find out.

00:57:27.190 --> 00:57:29.870
Bill and Tony wrote
comedy scripts together.

00:57:29.870 --> 00:57:33.280
That was who they were, and
Aldershot Police Station

00:57:33.280 --> 00:57:37.770
had nothing to do
with anything."

00:57:37.770 --> 00:57:38.754
[APPLAUSE]

00:57:38.754 --> 00:57:42.200
Thank you.

00:57:42.200 --> 00:57:44.760
I should point out
that homosexuality

00:57:44.760 --> 00:57:48.360
was illegal in
England until 1967,

00:57:48.360 --> 00:57:51.780
and quite a few people
were imprisoned.

00:57:51.780 --> 00:57:55.880
And the other thing is I came
up with that idea, which,

00:57:55.880 --> 00:57:59.110
of course, obviously has a big
influence on the characters,

00:57:59.110 --> 00:58:02.680
their sexuality,
because the two writers

00:58:02.680 --> 00:58:04.525
that they talk about--
Galton and Simpson

00:58:04.525 --> 00:58:09.660
that they admire who did
write "Steptoe and Son," which

00:58:09.660 --> 00:58:12.330
was "Sanford and Son," and all
of these great English comedy

00:58:12.330 --> 00:58:15.620
programs-- these two guys
met in real life in a TB

00:58:15.620 --> 00:58:20.150
clinic, tuberculosis clinic in
London at the end of the war.

00:58:20.150 --> 00:58:24.030
And a lot of people, young
people, especially in London,

00:58:24.030 --> 00:58:29.120
contracted tuberculosis because
of the state of sanitation.

00:58:29.120 --> 00:58:31.400
And in fact, one of
them, in particular,

00:58:31.400 --> 00:58:34.080
was seriously ill and
had the last rites read

00:58:34.080 --> 00:58:36.400
and all that sort of
thing, but as I was saying,

00:58:36.400 --> 00:58:38.870
very beautiful story
that these two guys

00:58:38.870 --> 00:58:41.790
in such unpromising
circumstances

00:58:41.790 --> 00:58:47.430
when they were so ill, and
stayed together writing.

00:58:47.430 --> 00:58:50.720
They still write together now.

00:58:50.720 --> 00:58:53.700
And they still-- they
wrote to me about the book,

00:58:53.700 --> 00:58:56.130
and they still sign
their letters together.

00:58:56.130 --> 00:59:00.410
And they were a big
influence on my own writing

00:59:00.410 --> 00:59:01.770
when I was growing up.

00:59:01.770 --> 00:59:05.700
I think they're geniuses, and
I wanted some kind of homage

00:59:05.700 --> 00:59:09.680
to them, which hence the
meeting in the prison.

00:59:09.680 --> 00:59:12.831
But then it became a book
about their sexuality as well.

00:59:12.831 --> 00:59:13.580
MALE SPEAKER: Wow.

00:59:13.580 --> 00:59:14.550
That's extraordinary.

00:59:14.550 --> 00:59:16.680
Thank you.

00:59:16.680 --> 00:59:19.880
Any questions for Nick
from the audience?

00:59:19.880 --> 00:59:20.930
NICK HORNBY: Hi.

00:59:20.930 --> 00:59:24.830
AUDIENCE: You mentioned the
brevity of screenwriting

00:59:24.830 --> 00:59:26.730
and the fact that
that made it difficult

00:59:26.730 --> 00:59:28.500
for you to write prose.

00:59:28.500 --> 00:59:31.610
There's been, of course,
a lot of discussion

00:59:31.610 --> 00:59:34.220
about the effects
of email and texting

00:59:34.220 --> 00:59:36.970
and so on on the
writing abilities

00:59:36.970 --> 00:59:39.630
of the general public.

00:59:39.630 --> 00:59:44.780
What I'm wondering is,
have you seen any effects

00:59:44.780 --> 00:59:50.300
on writings style of
professional writers?

00:59:50.300 --> 00:59:53.310
Have electronic
media had effects

00:59:53.310 --> 00:59:55.610
on the way literature
is written?

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.190
NICK HORNBY: That's a
very interesting question.

01:00:02.190 --> 01:00:07.720
I can remember in
the late '80s, I

01:00:07.720 --> 01:00:11.320
can remember some very
sniffy book critics saying,

01:00:11.320 --> 01:00:14.850
oh, this is a word
processor novel.

01:00:14.850 --> 01:00:17.630
And I never quite understood
what a word processor

01:00:17.630 --> 01:00:22.120
novel was supposed to be, apart
from that people were using

01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:24.780
more cut up forms,
and they thought

01:00:24.780 --> 01:00:27.950
they could see evidence
of cutting and pasting

01:00:27.950 --> 01:00:28.710
in this fiction.

01:00:28.710 --> 01:00:31.860
But of course, that
was something else

01:00:31.860 --> 01:00:32.920
going on in the culture.

01:00:32.920 --> 01:00:35.890
It wasn't anything to do with
the means by which people

01:00:35.890 --> 01:00:36.390
were using.

01:00:36.390 --> 01:00:40.170
I was so grateful for a word
processor when I first got one.

01:00:40.170 --> 01:00:43.900
It made me a better writer,
because I was such a bad typist

01:00:43.900 --> 01:00:47.040
that if I saw a bad sentence
in the middle of a page,

01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:50.030
I'd think, I'm not bloody
writing that whole thing out

01:00:50.030 --> 01:00:55.580
again, whereas now, of course,
it's done in two seconds.

01:00:55.580 --> 01:00:58.140
There have been lots
of novels recently

01:00:58.140 --> 01:01:02.840
that have used email
and text, and yeah, I

01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:07.630
think everything
is affecting us.

01:01:07.630 --> 01:01:11.290
I think that this generation of
writers, the last two or three

01:01:11.290 --> 01:01:13.830
generations, is the first
that grew up entirely

01:01:13.830 --> 01:01:17.340
within popular culture, and I
think that makes a difference.

01:01:17.340 --> 01:01:21.100
I haven't had a
classical education,

01:01:21.100 --> 01:01:26.470
and my references
are-- my influences

01:01:26.470 --> 01:01:31.670
are as much movies and
TV as they were books.

01:01:31.670 --> 01:01:34.700
And I think that the
younger writers now

01:01:34.700 --> 01:01:39.250
are very used to
writing quickly and not

01:01:39.250 --> 01:01:42.260
caring so much about style.

01:01:42.260 --> 01:01:45.240
And I think that as
it goes on, style

01:01:45.240 --> 01:01:50.280
might well be not
what we think it is.

01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:54.050
There is a kind of
classical prose style

01:01:54.050 --> 01:01:59.865
that somebody like Henry
James or Somerset Maugham

01:01:59.865 --> 01:02:05.040
or PG Woodhouse, these
people who crafted sentences,

01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:11.620
I suspect that that will go
over the next 20 to 30 years.

01:02:11.620 --> 01:02:16.080
And, of course, we will
miss some things about it,

01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:18.810
but it will bring
other things too.

01:02:18.810 --> 01:02:24.050
There's no doubt to
me that prose style

01:02:24.050 --> 01:02:27.450
will be profoundly affected
by texting and emailing.

01:02:27.450 --> 01:02:29.115
And I'm not saying
that as a nostalgic.

01:02:29.115 --> 01:02:32.010
I think it's just inevitable.

01:02:32.010 --> 01:02:36.770
MALE SPEAKER: I did want to talk
about your philanthropy work

01:02:36.770 --> 01:02:39.289
a little bit.

01:02:39.289 --> 01:02:41.580
NICK HORNBY: Charity rather
than philanthropy, I think.

01:02:41.580 --> 01:02:43.080
I would like to be
a philanthropist,

01:02:43.080 --> 01:02:45.836
but I'm not sure I'm
quite in that position.

01:02:45.836 --> 01:02:48.760
MALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE]
ambitious about autism

01:02:48.760 --> 01:02:52.380
and the Treehouse School
and the Ministry of Stories.

01:02:52.380 --> 01:02:55.710
Probably most people aren't
aware of your involvement

01:02:55.710 --> 01:02:58.030
with those two causes.

01:02:58.030 --> 01:03:04.170
NICK HORNBY: Well, my eldest
son has autism, and he's 21 now,

01:03:04.170 --> 01:03:07.620
but when he was
three, four years old,

01:03:07.620 --> 01:03:09.540
we couldn't find the
education that we wanted

01:03:09.540 --> 01:03:11.636
for him or the
style of education.

01:03:11.636 --> 01:03:13.260
There was something
going on in America

01:03:13.260 --> 01:03:16.900
that wasn't available in the
UK, and we banded together

01:03:16.900 --> 01:03:20.490
with another small group of
parents, four or five of us,

01:03:20.490 --> 01:03:21.820
to form a school.

01:03:21.820 --> 01:03:27.220
And we started with
these five autistic kids

01:03:27.220 --> 01:03:31.340
in the local library, which
should be a proverb, I think,

01:03:31.340 --> 01:03:33.740
to replace bull
in a China shop--

01:03:33.740 --> 01:03:35.090
autistic kids in a library.

01:03:37.620 --> 01:03:40.530
And eventually and slowly,
we got money together,

01:03:40.530 --> 01:03:45.820
and I edited a book, which was
published here and in the UK

01:03:45.820 --> 01:03:48.947
called "Speaking with the
Angel," which was a fundraiser.

01:03:48.947 --> 01:03:52.760
And anyway, years went by,
and not just because of me

01:03:52.760 --> 01:03:56.690
by any means, but eventually
this amazing school got built.

01:03:56.690 --> 01:04:00.200
And it cost 12 million pounds,
and there are 90 kids there,

01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:02.190
and it will be there forever.

01:04:02.190 --> 01:04:06.140
And Danny's left there now.

01:04:06.140 --> 01:04:10.750
So I moved on to something else
to do with my charitable time,

01:04:10.750 --> 01:04:16.070
which was the Ministry of
Stories, which is exactly

01:04:16.070 --> 01:04:19.410
Dave Eggers' 826 model.

01:04:19.410 --> 01:04:21.660
The 826 schools--
you have an 826

01:04:21.660 --> 01:04:25.070
in Boston, which I
hope you all support.

01:04:25.070 --> 01:04:28.430
And whenever I went
to San Francisco,

01:04:28.430 --> 01:04:31.980
I went to 826
Valencia, which always

01:04:31.980 --> 01:04:35.260
has seemed to be the
most incredible place

01:04:35.260 --> 01:04:37.890
creatively, all these
things going on,

01:04:37.890 --> 01:04:39.960
Dave's running
McSweeney's from there,

01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:41.880
and there were all
these young writers,

01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:44.400
editors making magazines.

01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:45.460
"The Believer" was there.

01:04:45.460 --> 01:04:48.880
McSweeney's was there,
t-shirts, and then

01:04:48.880 --> 01:04:52.030
all these inner city kids
who were getting help off

01:04:52.030 --> 01:04:56.150
all the people who were hanging
out at McSweeney's and getting

01:04:56.150 --> 01:04:57.176
help with their writing.

01:04:57.176 --> 01:04:58.550
And that seemed
to be such a kind

01:04:58.550 --> 01:05:03.800
of perfect model of putting two
sections of society together--

01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:07.980
one group of inner city
kids who weren't getting

01:05:07.980 --> 01:05:09.580
the same opportunities
as everyone

01:05:09.580 --> 01:05:13.630
else together with all these
kind of whiz kid graduate

01:05:13.630 --> 01:05:17.760
people who were making
all these great magazines.

01:05:17.760 --> 01:05:22.190
And they were-- one lot
was mentoring the other,

01:05:22.190 --> 01:05:25.670
but I think everyone felt
good about the experience,

01:05:25.670 --> 01:05:30.620
and then there was an 826 in
LA and in Boston and Chicago.

01:05:30.620 --> 01:05:34.150
There's, I think, nine of
them across America now.

01:05:34.150 --> 01:05:37.280
And I wanted to
do the same, so I

01:05:37.280 --> 01:05:39.300
was introduced to two
people who were determined

01:05:39.300 --> 01:05:42.710
to make it happen,
and I'm the co-founder

01:05:42.710 --> 01:05:45.490
of this writing
school in East London.

01:05:45.490 --> 01:05:46.240
MALE SPEAKER: Wow.

01:05:46.240 --> 01:05:48.860
That's wonderful.

01:05:48.860 --> 01:05:52.030
NICK HORNBY: It's such
a kind of no-brainer,

01:05:52.030 --> 01:05:56.480
actually, to help kids with
their literacy, I think.

01:05:56.480 --> 01:05:59.450
It's finding the ways
in which it works,

01:05:59.450 --> 01:06:01.915
and I think this is
a model that works.

01:06:01.915 --> 01:06:04.740
MALE SPEAKER: That's great.

01:06:04.740 --> 01:06:07.580
Anything else for Nick?

01:06:07.580 --> 01:06:09.770
Well, if not, thank you
very much for coming.

01:06:09.770 --> 01:06:12.100
Thank you most of all
to Nick for joining us.

01:06:12.100 --> 01:06:13.650
NICK HORNBY: Pleasure.
