00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
We see in the first quadrant all trigonometric functions are positive and that's because

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
well the opposite side, the adjacent side and the hypotenuse of any triangle

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
you're trying to draw will also be positive.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
We saw that quadrant II only designs positive, let's think quadrant III.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Let's imagine this giant angle.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Well, to talk about this angle, we're going to think about the smaller version

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
of the angle and we're going to make a right triangle.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Now, if this right triangle the opposite side goes below this zero line, so it's negative,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and the adjacent side goes to the left of this zero line so it's also negative.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I want to know in the third quadrant, which trig function is positive.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Is it the sine, the cosine, the tangent, all of them or none of them?

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Choose your best answer, and this is tricky, but remember think of what happens

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
when you perform the divisions required of each of these trigonometric ratios.

00:00:49.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Also to remind that the hypotenuse is always positive.
