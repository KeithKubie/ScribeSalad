it enhances the memory storage in young

00:04:14.559 --> 00:04:14.569
it enhances the memory storage in young
 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:17.649
it enhances the memory storage in young
people but also enhances memory storage

that exercise is important is because

but it's important for everybody so when
you exercise you increase your bone mass

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:37.169
you exercise you increase your bone mass
 

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:42.200
you exercise you increase your bone mass
you increase osteocalcin and you improve

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210
you increase osteocalcin and you improve
 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:46.520
you increase osteocalcin and you improve
