00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:04.080
Consider the following table
of values for a linear function

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.240
f of x is equal to mx plus b
and an exponential function g

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.340
of x is equal to a
times r to the x.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.000
Write the equation
for each function.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.640
And so they give us,
for each x-value,

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.657
what f of x is and
what g of x is.

00:00:19.657 --> 00:00:21.990
And we need to figure out the
equation for each function

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.600
and type them in over here.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.190
So I copy and
pasted this problem

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:26.910
on my little scratchpad.

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.080
So let's first think
about the linear function.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.900
And to figure out the
equation of a line

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.740
or a linear function
right over here,

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:37.520
you really just need two points.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.760
And I always like to use the
situation when x equals 0

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.840
because that makes
it very clear what

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.130
the y-intercept is going to be.

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:53.110
So, for example, we
can say that f of 0

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:58.630
is going to be equal
to m times 0 plus b.

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:01.330
Or this is just going
to be equal to b.

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:04.590
And they tell us that
f of 0 is equal to 5.

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:06.160
b is equal to 5.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.190
So we immediately know
that this b right over here

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:10.187
is equal to 5.

00:01:10.187 --> 00:01:11.770
Now, we just have
to figure out the m.

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.610
We have to figure out
the slope of this line.

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.290
So just as a little bit
of a refresher on slope,

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.350
the slope of this line is
going to be our change in y--

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.970
or our change in our function
I guess we could say,

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.560
if we say that this
y is equal to f

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.835
of x-- over our change in x.

00:01:27.835 --> 00:01:29.460
And actually, let me
write it that way.

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.080
We could write
this as our change

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.140
in our function
over our change in x

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.190
if you want to look
at it that way.

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:38.080
So let's look at
this first change

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.430
in x when x goes from 0 to 1.

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.590
So we finish at 1.

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.330
We started at 0.

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:49.100
And f of x finishes
at 7 and started at 5.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.010
So when x is 1, f of x is 7.

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.900
When x is 0, f of x is 5.

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:00.260
And we get a change
in our function of 2

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.550
when x changes by 1.

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:03.952
So our m is equal to 2.

00:02:03.952 --> 00:02:04.660
And you see that.

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:08.660
When x increases by 1, our
function increases by 2.

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.770
So now we know the
equation for f of x.

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:23.260
f of x is going to be equal
to 2 times 2x plus b, or 5.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.100
So we figured out
what f of x is.

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.790
Now we need to figure
out what g of x is.

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.910
So g of x is an
exponential function.

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.286
And there's really two things
that we need to figure out.

00:02:32.286 --> 00:02:33.910
We need to figure
out what a is, and we

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:35.120
need to figure out what r is.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.360
And let me just rewrite that.

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.700
So we know that g of x--
maybe I'll do it down here.

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:47.780
g of x is equal to a
times r to the x power.

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.820
And if we know what g of 0 is,
that's a pretty useful thing.

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.300
Because r to the 0th
power, regardless

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.270
of what r is-- or
I guess we could

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:58.080
assume that r is not equal to 0.

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.560
People can debate what
0 to the 0 power is.

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.590
But if r is any
non-zero number, we

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.900
know that if you raise it
to the 0 power, you get 1.

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.970
And so that
essentially gives us a.

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.050
So let's just write that down.

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:15.420
g of 0 is a times r to
the 0 power, which is just

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.540
going to be equal
to a times 1 or a.

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.060
And they tell us what g of
0 is. g of 0 is equal to 3.

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.780
So we know that a is equal to 3.

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:32.190
So so far, we know that our g
of x can be written as 3 times r

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.120
to the x power.

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.270
So now we can just use any
one of the other values

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:39.005
they gave us to solve for r.

00:03:39.005 --> 00:03:45.830
For example, they tell us
that g of 1 is equal to 2.

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:49.680
So let's write
that down. g of 1,

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:55.756
which would be 3 times r to
the first power, or just 3--

00:03:55.756 --> 00:03:56.630
let me just write it.

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:58.380
It could be 3 times
r to the first power,

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.600
or we could just write
that as 3 times r.

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:05.500
They tell us that g
of 1 is equal to 2.

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.080
So we get 3 times
r is equal to 2.

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.810
Or we get that r
is equal to 2/3.

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:15.630
Divide both sides of
this equation by 3.

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:16.940
So r is 2/3.

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:18.739
And we're done.

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:24.120
g of x is equal to 3 times 2/3.

00:04:27.414 --> 00:04:29.080
Actually, let me just
write it this way.

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:33.275
3 times 2/3 to the x power.

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:39.220
You could write it that way
if you want, any which way.

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:42.500
So 3 times 2/3 to the x power,
and f of x is 2x plus 5.

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.300
So let's actually
just type that in.

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.625
So f of x is 2x plus 5.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.190
And we can verify that that's
the expression that we want.

00:04:55.190 --> 00:05:07.569
And g of x is 3 times 2
over 3 to the x power.

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:09.735
And let me just verify that
that's what I did there.

00:05:09.735 --> 00:05:11.460
I have a short memory.

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:11.960
All right.

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:13.701
Yeah, that looks right.

00:05:13.701 --> 00:05:14.200
All right.

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:15.158
Let's check our answer.

00:05:15.158 --> 00:05:17.410
And we got it right.
