ALEX LEVICH: Hi, everyone.

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:08.000
This is Alex Levich.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.420
This is Women Techmakers Product
Management with Alex Levich.

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:13.560
I'm product manager at
Google, and today we'll

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.810
be talking about
creativity and innovation.

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:18.040
This is our guest,
Shimrit Ben-Yair

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.300
who is a product manager
for YouTube Kids.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:21.490
Welcome, Shimrit.

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:22.210
SHIMRIT BEN-YAIR:
Thank you, Alex.

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:23.070
Thanks for having me.

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.361
ALEX LEVICH: It's our pleasure.

00:00:24.361 --> 00:00:26.820
Shimrit, why don't you tell us
a little bit about yourself?

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:27.777
SHIMRIT BEN-YAIR: Sure.

00:00:27.777 --> 00:00:29.560
I'm a product
manager at YouTube.

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.479
I recently launched
our kids product.

00:00:31.479 --> 00:00:33.520
And I've been at Google
for almost six years now.

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.370
So before that, I worked
on Google+, on social.

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.920
And before that, I worked on
Google Groups and Google Docs.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.480
Outside of work, I'm a mom.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.490
I have two kids,
which may or may not

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:46.310
have inspired my
work on YouTube Kids.

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:48.186
And I'm really excited
to be with you, today.

00:00:48.186 --> 00:00:49.143
ALEX LEVICH: Wonderful.

00:00:49.143 --> 00:00:49.710
Thank you.

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.400
So Shimrit, tell us about
creativity and innovation.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.020
How important is that in
a product manager role?

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.210
SHIMRIT BEN-YAIR: I think
creativity and innovation

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.330
is a central quality
in a product manager.

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:04.590
But I think, people
often think of creativity

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:07.640
as sort of coming up
with a brand new idea.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.490
All of a sudden, you have this
completely different idea.

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.640
And it's like this magical idea,
and everyone should go do it.

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:16.750
I think that happens.

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.070
But I think often
creativity is actually

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.860
just looking at the world
with a fresh set of eyes

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.220
every single day.

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.690
So yes, it's about looking at
products in a different way.

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.495
But it's also about looking
at people in a different way.

00:01:29.495 --> 00:01:30.120
Understanding--

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.620
ALEX LEVICH: Our
users, for example.

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.310
SHIMRIT BEN-YAIR: Our users,
for one-- understanding,

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.110
empathizing with them
in different ways,

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.770
what's working for them,
what's not working for them.

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.510
The people we work with, right?

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:42.700
It's understanding,
oh, you know,

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.490
is this idea that
I'm rejecting--

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:45.620
why am I rejecting it?

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:49.870
Is it because I just don't see
the world like he or she does,

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:51.330
or is it because
there's something

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:52.930
really wrong with this idea?

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.130
So I think creativity is
really about understanding,

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.900
recognizing our
biases, recognizing

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.830
that everyone's
looking at the world

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.020
from a very narrow place, right?

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.030
And seeing, well, can we tackle
things in a different way?

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.762
Can we improve things
in a meaningful way?

00:02:10.762 --> 00:02:11.970
ALEX LEVICH: That is so true.

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.230
This reminds me of Chrome OS.

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.130
So Chrome OS is a laptop, right?

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.260
So the idea existed for
a while, as we know.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.970
But the idea of creating a
laptop at $200 that's still

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.950
very high quality
and people can use,

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.636
that's a very interesting idea
that did not exist before.

00:02:26.636 --> 00:02:28.260
And we developed in
a different manner,

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.810
and we are scaling in
a different manner.

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.310
And people are enjoying
Chromebooks all over the world.

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:35.755
I completely agree with you.

00:02:35.755 --> 00:02:37.850
But tell me this, how
do you push yourself

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.389
in a situation where you can
look with a fresh pair of eyes.

00:02:40.389 --> 00:02:42.930
SHIMRIT BEN-YAIR: I think that
there are a few ways to do it.

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.380
So I think that
creativity-- by the way,

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.260
I find that
creativity is actually

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.770
a skill that's learned.

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:52.540
It's like a muscle
that's trained.

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.290
It's not like, oh, I was either
born with that or I wasn't.

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:56.780
It's not a binary thing.

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.710
I think everyone can
grow it and cultivate it.

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:03.520
First and foremost, it's
surrounding yourself

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.010
with people who you
can be creative with.

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.930
For product manager, it's
your engineering leads

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:14.170
and understanding how to parse
their ideas, parse their input.

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.014
It's your designers
and understanding

00:03:16.014 --> 00:03:17.430
how they're seeing
the world, what

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:18.730
ideas they're coming up with.

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.870
Its marketing,
who's very in touch

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.500
with users and their needs.

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.420
So it's creating
that environment

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.412
in which you're
interacting with a lot

00:03:26.412 --> 00:03:27.620
of different kinds of people.

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:30.190
A diverse environment is
really important, I find,

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:31.610
for creativity.

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:35.600
Another really important
aspect is finding inspiration.

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.880
In order for you to
create space to think

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:43.680
of the world in a new way, you
have to have time, down time,

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.370
for this inspiration.

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.490
For me, I get a lot
of my inspiration

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:50.490
from museums, and art
museums, and contemporary art

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:52.410
that have nothing to
do with technology--

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.400
rarely have anything
to do with technology,

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.270
but I see them as
like these quizzes

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:59.400
or like these question marks of
like, hm, what does this mean.

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.510
Or, this even just
makes me feel good.

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:03.780
So that inspires me so.

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.760
Art is one thing, I think.

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.310
Social time is really important.

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:09.060
ALEX LEVICH: Yeah.

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.710
Just talking to people and your
friends who use your products.

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:12.240
SHIMRIT BEN-YAIR: Exactly.

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:13.040
ALEX LEVICH: Or even your kids.

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.520
I always get lots of
inspiration and ideas from kids

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:18.327
and how they approach things
they've never seen before.

00:04:18.327 --> 00:04:20.910
I bet you've seen this with your
kids and the YouTube kids app

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:21.610
actually.

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.899
SHIMRIT BEN-YAIR: Yeah.

00:04:21.899 --> 00:04:23.160
I saw it with my own kids.

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.930
And I saw it with
all the kids that we

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:26.625
were testing the product with.

00:04:26.625 --> 00:04:28.855
When we built the app,
we thought, oh, we

00:04:28.855 --> 00:04:30.980
want to build a family
friendly version of YouTube.

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:32.530
Easy peasy.

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:33.350
We as parents--

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.730
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:34.604
MERIT BEN-YAIR: Yeah.

00:04:34.604 --> 00:04:36.690
We as parents know how our
kids are using the app.

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:40.600
But actually, it turns out to
be a much more nuanced thing.

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.860
As our testers, as my kids
and other kids of Googlers

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.630
and YouTubers were
using the app,

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:49.000
you see, actually, fingers
are clumsier than we thought.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.545
They're using the border
of the screen, what

00:04:52.545 --> 00:04:54.670
we call the chrome of the
screen in a different way

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:55.830
than what we expect.

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.240
So we had to make
tap targets bigger.

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.410
Kids don't read.

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:01.840
So even the text that
we were emphasizing

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.100
was useless to younger kids.

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:06.320
So we had to make
images be bigger.

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:08.360
Another thing is
actually borrowing

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:09.990
from the world of video games.

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:12.870
So kids today play a lot
of games all the time.

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.452
And they're expecting
iconography that's playful.

00:05:15.452 --> 00:05:16.660
They're expecting animations.

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:18.610
They're expecting sounds.

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:21.690
So we added those in
so that it would really

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:25.310
represent kind of what the
world looks like for kids,

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:28.350
and bring that into YouTube.

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:30.330
ALEX LEVICH: That
sounds very right.

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:31.820
I totally see it
in the app today.

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:32.972
My kids love using it.

00:05:32.972 --> 00:05:34.180
Every day, I give it to them.

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:34.800
SHIMRIT BEN-YAIR: That's good.

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:35.375
Continue.

00:05:35.375 --> 00:05:36.250
ALEX LEVICH: We will.

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:36.810
SHIMRIT BEN-YAIR: OK, good.

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:38.160
ALEX LEVICH: As a
Chromecast integration.

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:38.750
SHIMRIT BEN-YAIR: OK.

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:39.320
Sounds good.

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:40.534
We're working on it.

00:05:40.534 --> 00:05:42.200
ALEX LEVICH: This is
all very important.

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:44.033
But sometimes there are
challenging moments.

00:05:44.033 --> 00:05:46.630
Not always will you have your
eureka moment when you need it.

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:48.838
And you're trying to solve
problems everyday at work.

00:05:48.838 --> 00:05:51.110
How have you dealt
with it in the past?

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:53.070
SHIMRIT BEN-YAIR:
Creativity is actually

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:55.550
really weaved in
and tied in strongly

00:05:55.550 --> 00:06:01.040
to communication and analysis.

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:05.550
One of the things that I think
people who are not creative do

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:08.690
is they just want to
rush to a solution.

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:12.130
They're confronted with a
problem, and they're like,

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:14.540
OK, I'm going to spend a little
bit of time finding out--

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:15.680
and then they're
like, OK, we're going

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:17.210
to do this and this and this.

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:19.710
But actually, the best product
managers and the best leaders

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:21.720
that I see are
able to really take

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:24.540
time to think and understand
the problem, and say, OK, well

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:26.250
what is the real issue here.

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:26.760
Pause.

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:29.191
And say, OK, these
are the dimensions

00:06:29.191 --> 00:06:30.190
that we're dealing with.

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:30.990
This is the issue.

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:32.531
There's something
that we're missing.

00:06:32.531 --> 00:06:35.420
They're able to bring in
different types of people

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:38.260
for their input and
analyze tradeoffs

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.360
before they jump to a solution.

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:42.900
So to me, creativity
is actually tied

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:44.850
into dealing with ambiguity.

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:47.830
And the best PMs that
I know are able to deal

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:49.700
with a high level of ambiguity.

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:51.359
You're able to
say, actually, I'm

00:06:51.359 --> 00:06:52.900
going to create an
environment that's

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:55.310
a little bit more ambiguous
for the time being

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:57.660
until we find the
right solution.

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:00.430
And they're able to shield
all the fear, uncertainty,

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:03.432
and doubt that
results from-- no one

00:07:03.432 --> 00:07:04.640
likes an ambiguous situation.

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:06.610
Oh, what do you mean we have
this problem in the product

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:07.859
that we don't know how to fix?

00:07:07.859 --> 00:07:10.430
They're saying, yeah, and
we're going to, by Thursday,

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:12.800
or Friday, or next week, we're
going to have a solution.

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.460
But we're pausing to
really understand it.

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:17.600
And I think that discipline
is really important.

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:18.350
ALEX LEVICH: Yeah.

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:20.475
I've seen it many times in
our work here at Google.

00:07:20.475 --> 00:07:22.350
And it is very tough,
but must be done,

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:24.420
and definitely gets us
to better solutions.

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:25.500
Completely agree.

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:27.970
You mentioned downtime before,
and it also kinds of leads

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:30.410
into your strengths
and your ability

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:34.120
to deal with ambiguity and
not rushing into solutions.

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:36.460
How do you balance
work and life?

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:38.550
How do you find time
to go to museums,

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:42.360
take care of two young kids, and
deal with ambiguity every day

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:43.810
at work?

00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:46.420
SHIMRIT BEN-YAIR: When I
became a parent four years ago,

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:50.310
I realized that I would never,
ever be able to compete again

00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:53.070
on my time spent at the office.

00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:56.480
If I wanted to have a meaningful
experience as a parent

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:58.740
and have time with
my kids, that means

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:01.830
that I would need to have
a pretty predictable time

00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:02.992
in which I come to work.

00:08:02.992 --> 00:08:04.450
The time that I
became a parent has

00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:07.260
made me a much better product
manager, in my opinion.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.250
I'm a much better
leader because now I

00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:12.970
know that every day, at the
same time-- for me at 5:30--

00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:15.410
I go home and I spend
time with my kids.

00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:18.257
And so I have to be much
more organized about my day.

00:08:18.257 --> 00:08:20.340
I have to be much more
thoughtful about the things

00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:22.070
that I do and not do.

00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:24.954
And I think that that actually
creates a better environment

00:08:24.954 --> 00:08:27.370
for the people around me and
for the product because we're

00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:30.210
able to focus and
do fewer things,

00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:32.450
but do them really, really well.

00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:33.909
ALEX LEVICH:
Prioritize and focus.

00:08:33.909 --> 00:08:34.409
Exactly.

00:08:34.409 --> 00:08:35.270
I feel the same way.

00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:37.760
SHIMRIT BEN-YAIR: I also
feel like as a working mom,

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:40.470
a lot of the pressures that
working moms have is actually

00:08:40.470 --> 00:08:41.850
self-inflicted.

00:08:41.850 --> 00:08:43.980
It's like, oh, I'm feeling
guilty I'm at work.

00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:45.520
Oh, why am I not with my kids?

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:48.090
Oh, I'm with my kids-- oh,
why am I not checking email

00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:49.150
or why am I not at work?

00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:50.490
And I think that actually--

00:08:50.490 --> 00:08:51.340
ALEX LEVICH: It's
important to separate.

00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:53.465
SHIMRIT BEN-YAIR: It's
important to recognize this.

00:08:53.465 --> 00:08:58.380
I think somehow, maybe
culturally, in like the past 50

00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:01.000
years or I don't know what it
is that has wired us to look

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.130
at the world with
this guilt mindset,

00:09:03.130 --> 00:09:06.620
but really I try to just be
present when I'm with my kids.

00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:08.060
I try not to be on email.

00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:11.310
I failed occasionally,
but most of the time,

00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:12.540
I try to be with my kids.

00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:15.240
And when I'm at work, I
don't linger and think, oh,

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:17.620
I wish I could be
with a park now.

00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:19.390
And I think that
that has liberated

00:09:19.390 --> 00:09:22.290
me to be able to focus and to
be able to have a good time.

00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:23.820
I think creativity
and innovation--

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:25.740
to tie back into your
original question--

00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:28.510
is all about creating space.

00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:30.820
If you're constantly
just transactional,

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:33.159
you're never going
to have space to look

00:09:33.159 --> 00:09:34.700
at the world with
a fresh set of eyes

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:36.540
and to do things
in a better way.

00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:39.370
ALEX LEVICH: So if creativity
is this muscle that you train,

00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:40.980
is it important to
find roles where

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:43.790
you would be more in a
position to train it everyday?

00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:46.159
Or what's a good role
to take in your mind?

00:09:46.159 --> 00:09:47.700
SHIMRIT BEN-YAIR:
Every role is going

00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:49.970
to have some degree
of creativity.

00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:51.904
Products have different
levels of maturity.

00:09:51.904 --> 00:09:53.820
And actually, I've been
fortunate in my career

00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:56.430
to have worked on products with
different levels of maturity.

00:09:56.430 --> 00:09:59.260
When I first joined Google,
I worked on Google Groups

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:00.370
and Google Docs.

00:10:00.370 --> 00:10:02.360
And they were already
launched products.

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:04.860
And there, I was just
making improvements to them.

00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:07.930
So there, I had to be creative
in improving an existing

00:10:07.930 --> 00:10:10.110
product that already
had a set of users

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:11.367
with very specific needs.

00:10:11.367 --> 00:10:13.200
But still, I needed to
understand, OK, well,

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:16.579
how do we do well for-- how do
we understand our user base?

00:10:16.579 --> 00:10:18.120
How do we make sure
everyone's happy?

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:19.880
That was a very
different problem

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:21.880
than when I'm working
on YouTube Kids.

00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:25.320
That was a brand new product
experience that we launched.

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:27.890
The first time that YouTube
launches a product that's

00:10:27.890 --> 00:10:29.850
friendly for families.

00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:32.390
So expectations are
a little different.

00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:33.900
So I personally
think you're going

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:38.410
to have creativity in every
single role that you have.

00:10:38.410 --> 00:10:40.950
But it's just the creativity
is going to manifest itself

00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:42.310
in different ways.

00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:46.080
When choosing roles and when
choosing things to focus on,

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:47.950
I think the three
most important things

00:10:47.950 --> 00:10:52.072
are to choose an area that has
a lot of growth ahead of it,

00:10:52.072 --> 00:10:53.530
to choose an area
in which you feel

00:10:53.530 --> 00:10:56.630
like, OK, I'm learning a skill
that I didn't in the past.

00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:58.350
I don't know
monetization, so I'm

00:10:58.350 --> 00:11:01.360
going to choose a role
that has a lot of ads,

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:04.390
or something, a subscription
that I can work on.

00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:06.940
Or I don't know mobile well, so
I'm going to work on Android,

00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:09.692
or I'm going to work
on a mobile app.

00:11:09.692 --> 00:11:11.150
So I think that's
a second element.

00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:13.880
And then third, and most
important in my opinion,

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:15.960
is choosing a product
that you're just

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:17.710
going to love working
with the people.

00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:20.190
Because with the right people,
you can build any product.

00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:20.750
ALEX LEVICH: Yeah.

00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:22.791
Goes back to the partnerships
that you mentioned.

00:11:22.791 --> 00:11:25.550
You're able to forms those and
be creative and innovative.

00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:26.780
SHIMRIT BEN-YAIR: Exactly.

00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:28.020
ALEX LEVICH: That
makes perfect sense.

00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:30.311
Well, Shimrit, thank you so
much for being here with us

00:11:30.311 --> 00:11:31.600

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:32.660
SHIMRIT BEN-YAIR:
Oh, you're welcome.

00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:33.490
Thanks for having me.

00:11:33.490 --> 00:11:35.406
ALEX LEVICH: And thanks
