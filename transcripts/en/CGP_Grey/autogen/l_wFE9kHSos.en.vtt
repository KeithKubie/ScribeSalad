00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.460
 The main video is currently using a little trick. 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.020
 The rate that advertisers pay per 1000 views is actually a lot higher ... 

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:09.960
 ... and if you have a YouTube channel you can watch your analytics and see a song ... 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.220
 ... that is much larger per 1000. 

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:16.380
 This is because there are a number of YouTube viewings where no advertisement is displayed. 

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:18.620
 If you find that hard to believe, it's probably because you ... 

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:23.580
 ... is in a main target group that advertisers want, so you always get ads on YouTube. 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.240
 But there are demographics that rarely see advertisements. 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.980
 In addition, YouTube does not show advertisements for people arriving on the site for the first time. 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.840
 Channels can have 30%, 40%, up to 90% of their viewings without an advertisement ... 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:41.140
 ... to play, because there are viewers who are in a time or location that fewer advertisers want. 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.960
 Or, fewer advertisers can be present. 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.300
 But if you make a YouTube channel, then the number you are really worried about ... 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:51.140
 ... the one on your check, divided by your thousands of viewings. 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.760
 This is the number that video makers compare with each other, 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.760
 even though YouTube doesn't really want us to do that.
