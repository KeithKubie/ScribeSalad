00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:10.559
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: My name is Lauren Hannah-Murphy
and I'm really excited that we have our first

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:11.559
Filmmakers@Google event today.

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:16.160
And I'm really excited to introduce Doug Hannah,
who is my younger brother.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:21.900
So I think it's safe to say I have known him
his whole life.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:22.900
[laughter]

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:27.860
And from the moment that my Dad got his first
camcorder, he was making movies of one sort

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:28.860
or another.

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:31.890
Sometimes he was in front of the camera.

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.540
Sometimes, he was behind.

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.429
So, it's always been pretty obvious that he
was going to do something with film.

00:00:38.429 --> 00:00:45.370
There was a short period of time when he had
me taping him as he would climb out from our

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.510
second floor and climb down the tree 'cause
he thought he wanted to be a stunt man.

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.390
But that didn't last too long.

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:53.390
[laughter]

00:00:53.390 --> 00:01:00.579
And he went to school for Film and now has
been doing a lot of editing and film-making.

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:04.059
So, he's here today--without any of our home
videos, thankfully--but has his short film,

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:08.750
"Good News, Oklahoma!" and I'll let him introduce
that.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:14.880
So, please join me in welcoming Doug Hannah.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:15.880
[applause]

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.479
&gt;&gt;Doug Hannah: Thank you, guys.

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:23.690
That was a very good introduction.

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.820
Way more personal than any of the other introductions
I've had so far.

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:27.820
[laughter]

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.950
Well, thank you guys all for coming and watching
my short film.

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.240
We made this last year at the end of December.

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.200
So, this has been around for about a year.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.799
We've been doing the festival circuits.

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:42.780
I think we've screened it at about nine film
festivals so far.

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.000
It won Best Comedy Short at the Atlanta Short
Fest, which was our first festival.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.549
So right off the bat, it was really pretty
exciting.

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:56.009
I work for White Collar, which is a USA TV
show.

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.439
And the writer is also a writer for White
Collar.

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:04.149
And about at the end of Season Two, we were
talking about what we were gonna do during

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:05.149
our break.

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:10.910
And I was wanting to direct a short, 'cause
I'm trying to finagle my way out of editing,

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:16.140
since I'm getting sick of sitting in a dark
room all the time and getting into more of

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.099
the directing side of things.

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:21.670
And she had a few shorts and she pitched me
a couple ideas.

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.370
And she talked about this idea called "Good
News, Oklahoma!"

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.750
And instantly, I really knew I wanted to make
it.

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.280
I won't go too much into the plot now, since
we're about to watch it.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.940
But I'm pretty addicted to news and watch
a lot of news and stuff.

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.560
And so, this was one of the reasons why I
wanted to make it.

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.840
And I'll go more into the other reasons why
I wanted to make it after you see it.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:52.260
But yeah, I think I'll leave it at that.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.549
Channing Powell is who wrote it--a really
talented writer.

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:59.799
And it was really fun getting to work with
her.

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:03.000
And if you're watching this online, it's just
gonna be a trailer.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.760
I can't put the whole movie online 'cause
a lot of film festivals will only accept movies

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.510
that are not screened online.

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.370
They want it to have some type of premier
status more than anyone just being able to

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:16.370
watch it.

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:18.629
But all you guys can watch it now.

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:23.549
And then from here, we're going out to Denver
next weekend for the Festivus Film Festival.

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:26.330
So, we're excited about that.

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:27.330
But yeah.

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.140
Without further ado, here's a short film.

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:30.140
It's 18 minutes.

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:31.140
17:56.

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.140
[laughter]

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:33.140
It's called "Good News, Oklahoma!"

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:34.140
[plays film]

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:35.140
[happy music]

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:36.140
&gt;&gt;Sissy: I'm talking about a different kind
of news program.

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:37.140
One that doesn't sensationalize fear, but
promotes happiness.

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:38.140
I'm talking about a news program brought to
you by Sissy and Shaggy, your local alternative

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:39.140
news source.

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:40.140
&gt;&gt;Shaggy: Men from all over the country have
flooded the organization with their semen

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:41.140
donations.

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:42.140
&gt;&gt;Sissy: Truly an inspiring gift, Shaggy.

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:43.140
&gt;&gt;Shaggy: People really like good news.

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:44.140
[whistling music]

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:45.140
&gt;&gt;Tucker: Bad news, Oklahoma.

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:46.140
&gt;&gt;Barbara: Why would a news station with so-called
"good intentions" incite so much so-called

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:47.140
"bad behavior?"

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:48.140
&gt;&gt;Carl: You have to see this footage me and
[inaudible] uploaded to my laptop inside.

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:49.140
[glass shattering]

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:50.140
&gt;&gt;Birch: Amazing.

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:51.140
&gt;&gt;Barbara: Fuck me.

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:52.140
There's death of innocence on another network.

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:53.140
&gt;&gt;Sissy: It is our job to tell a story in
the face of adversity.

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:54.140
We're journalists.

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:55.140
&gt;&gt;Shaggy: I went to Business School.

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.090
&gt;&gt;Barbara: What you're saying is that Good
News, Oklahoma! is anti-American?

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:03.150
&gt;&gt;Ray: That's a good way to put it.

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:04.409
&gt;&gt;Sissy: If they're gonna yell at us, we're
gonna yell back louder.

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:05.409
&gt;&gt;Shaggy: Then how can anyone hear?

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:06.409
[Sissy sighs]

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:07.409
[crowd protests]

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:08.409
&gt;&gt;Sissy: Good News, Oklahoma!

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:09.409
Even violence isn't the answer.

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:10.409
[glass shatters]

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:11.409
[Sissy screams]

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:12.409
&gt;&gt;Tucker: Lesson learned.

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:13.409
[Barbara laughs]

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:14.409
&gt;&gt;Barbara: The hard way.

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:15.409
&gt;&gt;Birch: You're under contract.

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:20.820
&gt;&gt;Birch: We lose our right to pursue the American
Dreams, while suppressing your brothers.

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:30.650
&gt;&gt;Barbara: A good scoop.

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:37.970
That is a story.

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:44.680
We'll be back after these messages.

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.400
[loud movie music]

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.949
[end film clip]

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:53.470
[applause]

00:04:53.470 --> 00:05:02.470
&gt;&gt;Doug Hannah: So, that was "Good News, Oklahoma!"

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:03.470
[laughter]

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:06.060
So, I like I said, we shot that back in December.

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:08.169
It was a five-day shoot.

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:09.169
We had two cameras.

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:10.319
We shot on the red.

00:05:10.319 --> 00:05:11.970
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #1: What is that?

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:13.669
&gt;&gt;Doug Hannah: The red?

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:15.830
Yeah, I don't know if anyone follows it.

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:17.550
It's just a kind of camera.

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:22.740
A lot of the lower budget and actually, I
guess, more of the TV shows are using the

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:24.970
red now to shoot.

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:25.970
It gives a lot.

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:29.229
It has a sensor in it that shoots a very wide
range of everything.

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:33.750
So, it gives you a lot of control after in
post-production to really tweak the colors

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:34.750
and stuff.

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:38.660
And you can add shadows and make areas dark
and stuff like that.

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:45.710
Coming from an editorial standpoint, I get
a little geeky when it comes to the tech side

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:47.860
of stuff like that.

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:52.130
Oh, so I'll talk a little bit about--.

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:55.699
Like, "Good News, Oklahoma!"--its concept
and everything.

00:05:55.699 --> 00:06:01.800
From the start, I get the question often of
how we chose Oklahoma.

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:08.200
And beside it just sounding good in the title,
"Good News, Oklahoma!" we obviously were thinking

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:10.819
of more conservative states in the US.

00:06:10.819 --> 00:06:16.630
And the more research I was doing about it,
I found that Oklahoma was the only state where

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:22.840
during the 2008 election, every single district
had voted for McCain, which to me just seemed

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:28.180
crazy having grown up in Chicago, gone to
school in New York, and been living in California.

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:29.960
Everyone was obsessed of Obama.

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:38.080
So, to think of an entire state that just
wasn't interested in that seemed very different.

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:42.810
And so, I mean, it goes back and forth between
Oklahoma and Utah as being the two most conservative

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:43.810
states.

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:49.560
And so, "Good News, Oklahoma" sounds better
than "Good News, Utah," as well.

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:53.419
&gt;&gt;MALE #1: So does Park City, which rules.

00:06:53.419 --> 00:06:54.860
&gt;&gt;Doug Hannah: Yeah.

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:55.860
Exactly.

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:59.460
So, that was part of the reason why we wanted
to make it was about Oklahoma.

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:03.610
And then when I had the script and was going
over it, I met someone from Oklahoma and I

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:10.940
explained to her the basic idea of it--a liberal
that makes everything that you just saw.

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:16.389
And she was just like, she thought I had to
make it, having grown up her entire life in

00:07:16.389 --> 00:07:17.389
Oklahoma.

00:07:17.389 --> 00:07:24.040
And her brother still lived out there and
was like, living in a town of 500 people.

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:28.620
And something that I always wondered was about
people that vote against their own interests,

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:29.880
kind of thing.

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:35.430
And so, her younger brother that still lives
there was talking to these people in the town

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:41.600
of 500 and slowly being like, "Oh, well if
you don't have health insurance, maybe you

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:44.169
should start voting a different way."

00:07:44.169 --> 00:07:47.740
So, that was all fueling the fire for this.

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:53.330
Obviously, I didn't wanna make the short too
overtly political, though.

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:57.919
I think it's really easy to make something
that has all your ideas and beliefs in it.

00:07:57.919 --> 00:08:01.051
And then, people get really turned off by
it very quickly 'cause then they just see

00:08:01.051 --> 00:08:03.349
it as a liberal movie.

00:08:03.349 --> 00:08:06.101
So, we took a lot of the jokes out.

00:08:06.101 --> 00:08:12.129
Originally, there was some jokes about broad
stereotypes about Tea Partiers and stuff like

00:08:12.129 --> 00:08:13.129
that.

00:08:13.129 --> 00:08:14.400
And we focused a little more.

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:20.949
So, it was a little more accessible for everybody
so people would just take it for the entertainment

00:08:20.949 --> 00:08:23.290
value and not feel like they're being attacked.

00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:27.530
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #2: How has that gone over?

00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:29.259
&gt;&gt;Doug Hannah: It's actually gone--.

00:08:29.259 --> 00:08:36.850
I was gonna say is we showed it at the Tulsa
Film Fest and on the right over there, I'm

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:40.760
sitting on the flight and I'm sitting next
to a guy who's from Oklahoma, who had never

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:41.820
been on a plane before.

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:47.010
And he was freaking out and telling me to
talk to him the whole time.

00:08:47.010 --> 00:08:50.540
And in my head I'm thinking, "Oh, my God.

00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:51.540
What did I get myself into?"

00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:52.540
But no one, like--.

00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:53.540
But I showed it to everyone.

00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:57.030
I've given people that go to a festival--a
film festival--are obviously a little more

00:08:57.030 --> 00:09:00.170
artistic, maybe liberal, you could say.

00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:07.970
I think I'm stereotyping, but everyone was
really open and didn't feel like they're being

00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:11.250
attacked as being from Oklahoma or anything
like that.

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:18.090
And if anything related to it and wanted to
know where we got actors that had Oklahoma

00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:21.140
accents and stuff.

00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:24.450
Which leads me to the next thing is that we
did film this in LA.

00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:29.790
We lucked out, or didn't luck out, where the
week were filming in December, it was raining

00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:30.790
the entire week.

00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:34.640
So, that's why all the exterior's , all kinda
gray and stuff, which actually helped us out

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:35.640
a lot.

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:38.700
One palm tree snuck in there.

00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:40.850
I don't know if anyone caught it.

00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:41.850
[laughter]

00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:44.160
It's just in the background outside of the
house.

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:48.740
He walks by a palm tree.

00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:51.830
I think that kinda covers it.

00:09:51.830 --> 00:09:54.770
Maybe I'll open it up to questions.

00:09:54.770 --> 00:09:55.770
Yeah.

00:09:55.770 --> 00:09:58.090
Does anyone have any questions?

00:09:58.090 --> 00:09:59.090
I'll--.

00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:02.120
&gt;&gt;MALE #2: How long was the shoot itself?

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:03.910
&gt;&gt;Doug Hannah: Oh, yeah.

00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:04.910
The shoot was five days.

00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:05.910
I completed the whole thing.

00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:06.910
It is about four months.

00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:09.130
I probably could've gotten it done in three.

00:10:09.130 --> 00:10:12.320
It's one of those things with any short film,
if you ever talk to a director, they'll take

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:13.790
up as much time as they have.

00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:16.060
So, if I had five months, it would've been
five months.

00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:19.190
But if I had six, it would've probably taken
me six.

00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:20.630
[Doug Hannah coughs]

00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:23.280
But a five-day shoot.

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:24.280
It was pretty good.

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:26.280
The script--the original script--was 25 pages.

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:31.100
So, we were shooting about five or six pages
a day.

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:35.240
If you compare that to White Collar, which
our scripts on that show are,

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:41.230
I think, about 50 to 55 pages and they shoot
those in seven days.

00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:46.330
So, there, they're shooting about anywhere
from six and a half to ten, eleven pages a

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:47.330
day.

00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:51.190
But that's, obviously, with a full professional
crew.

00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:57.370
We did have a crew of about 35 people, which
for an independent short for this was really

00:10:57.370 --> 00:10:58.370
good.

00:10:58.370 --> 00:11:00.570
And it was just one of those things where
since we were shooting with two cameras, all

00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:02.580
of a sudden our camera department was really
big.

00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:04.640
And then because of that, it just--.

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:06.300
Everything built on top of it.

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:07.320
Any other questions?

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:09.700
&gt;&gt;MALE #3: How did you finance it?

00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:12.920
&gt;&gt;Doug Hannah: Me and the writer really just
wanted to make it.

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:16.510
And so, we just split it.

00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:18.750
[Doug Hannah laughs]

00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:19.750
Yeah.

00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:26.380
And called in every favor of everyone I've
ever worked with.

00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:27.880
Our producer was amazing.

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:29.110
She was--.

00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:33.320
She's an actress out in LA and she'd been
working out there for like, 15 years.

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:38.630
And so, the majority of the actors were all
cast just through friends of hers that are

00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:40.750
all working actors.

00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:42.790
A lot of those guys do a lot of commercials.

00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:48.100
So you might recognize them from random commercials
here and there.

00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:49.920
&gt;&gt;MALE #4: So they gave you good rates?

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:50.920
&gt;&gt;Doug Hannah: Yeah.

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:51.920
[laughter]

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:53.990
The best rate that they could possibly give,
which was free.

00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:56.670
Yeah, exactly.

00:11:56.670 --> 00:11:57.920
The actors were all amazing.

00:11:57.920 --> 00:11:59.570
We really lucked out on--.

00:11:59.570 --> 00:12:06.020
Myself, coming from an editing background
and into directing,

00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:11.040
I had the misconception of like, "Oh, well
I watch performances all day long and choose

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:12.040
the good ones."

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:16.810
So I thought, "I'll know if they have a good
performance 'cause I'm used to watching it."

00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:19.950
And then I got on set and it was like--.

00:12:19.950 --> 00:12:22.900
When you're creating something from scratch,
it's totally different than when I'm just

00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:25.640
sitting in my little edit bay watching performances.

00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:29.580
And that's something I've been working on
now with taking acting classes and stuff.

00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:31.020
But I hadn't done it at the time.

00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:37.960
But really was lucky to have such good actors
that they were able to do the script analysis

00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:39.820
and really know what was going on.

00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:45.680
And I think they all did a really fantastic
job and really understood the tone of the

00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:47.350
whole movie and did a great job.

00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:52.470
&gt;&gt;MALE #5: So, what motivates them to do it
for free?

00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:53.470
&gt;&gt;Doug Hannah: Um.

00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:54.470
I was wondering the same thing.

00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:59.100
And talking to my friend, it's like, actors,
they just wanna act.

00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:07.270
And like Sarayu, who was our lead, unfortunately
in Hollywood it's hard for an Indian actress

00:13:07.270 --> 00:13:09.190
to be the lead of stuff.

00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:11.220
I mean, she's constantly working.

00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:14.360
She's a really great actress.

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:20.070
But she was a series regular on "Sons of Tucson,"
and that was one of the few spots where they

00:13:20.070 --> 00:13:21.800
had a leading Indian woman.

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:23.710
But it's not very common.

00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:25.380
And then the other ones--.

00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:27.000
It was just a fun script.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:32.960
It actually said something as opposed to just
being about nothing, which I guess is often

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:33.960
the case.

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:34.960
So, yeah.

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:35.960
It was really nice of them.

00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:41.570
&gt;&gt;MALE #6: So, it seemed like you're targeting
both the over sensationalism side of news

00:13:41.570 --> 00:13:45.760
and the right-wing slant.

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:55.482
And I'm wondering if you could tease out what
percent of the target is.

00:13:55.482 --> 00:13:56.482
&gt;&gt;Doug Hannah: Yeah.

00:13:56.482 --> 00:13:58.850
The original script was pretty 50/50.

00:13:58.850 --> 00:14:04.950
And I had decided I wanted it to lean more
to the news aspect of it.

00:14:04.950 --> 00:14:10.070
And then, the kind of right-wing stuff that
was more of just like what was going on, I

00:14:10.070 --> 00:14:15.540
wanted that to be more of the backdrop and
less of what the movie was about.

00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:22.990
Like I said, I didn't really wanna feel like
anyone was being attacked, except sensationalized

00:14:22.990 --> 00:14:27.850
news, which is more of a thing than a person.

00:14:27.850 --> 00:14:29.500
And yeah.

00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:31.540
Like I said before, I'm pretty obsessed with
news.

00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:37.440
I watch probably more news than is healthy
for me, to the point where when I'm just traveling

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:41.790
out of the country and came back and they're
still talking about the same stuff, like with

00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:47.500
the Republican Primaries and stuff, I realized
that life goes on.

00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:48.500
[laughter]

00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:54.130
&gt;&gt;MALE #7: Have you had any feedback from
people who work in newsrooms?

00:14:54.130 --> 00:14:56.830
&gt;&gt;Doug Hannah: Not really, actually.

00:14:56.830 --> 00:14:57.830
No.

00:14:57.830 --> 00:14:58.830
No.

00:14:58.830 --> 00:14:59.830
That's what I was thinking.

00:14:59.830 --> 00:15:00.830
No one really has said much.

00:15:00.830 --> 00:15:07.700
I don't know how many people have seen it
from the news side of stuff, which is interesting.

00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:08.700
Yeah?

00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:13.490
&gt;&gt;MALE #8: Was 18 minutes-- is that the expectation
from the festival circuit?

00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:14.490
Is that--?

00:15:14.490 --> 00:15:15.490
&gt;&gt;Doug Hannah: It's long.

00:15:15.490 --> 00:15:18.010
&gt;&gt;MALE #8: It just felt natural from the script,
or--?

00:15:18.010 --> 00:15:19.440
&gt;&gt;Doug Hannah: Yeah.

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:23.800
Eighteen minutes is long for a short and it
struggles to get into festivals.

00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:28.740
The ideal time for a short to screen at festivals
would be like, seven minutes, because they

00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:34.280
try to put as many short films together in
a 120-minute program.

00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:42.020
So, if they take my film, then that's two
or three shorts that they're not able to put

00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:43.220
in.

00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:45.790
The script was 25 pages.

00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:49.750
So typically, it's a minute per page.

00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:53.730
So, the first cut was about 22, 23 minutes.

00:15:53.730 --> 00:15:56.450
And then we just start cutting.

00:15:56.450 --> 00:15:58.320
Tried to get it as short as possible.

00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:01.130
We had to cut down to 15 minutes at one point.

00:16:01.130 --> 00:16:04.740
But then it was just like, pssh.

00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:09.770
Stuff was flying by and there was no moment
to breathe or really know what was going on.

00:16:09.770 --> 00:16:15.680
We had cut that scene--the nighttime scene--where
they're talking in the kitchen thing with

00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:19.990
the Chinese food, which kind of explains what's
going on and it gives you a moment to breathe.

00:16:19.990 --> 00:16:26.200
Because everything else is just coming right
at you, which was a choice to have everything

00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:33.140
else moving really fast 'cause I wanted to
have that feeling of the news, the fast-moving

00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:34.910
of that type of stuff.

00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:39.770
And that was one of the reasons why we shot
with two cameras, 'cause we had a ton of camera

00:16:39.770 --> 00:16:40.770
angles.

00:16:40.770 --> 00:16:42.860
So, I was able to, when editing, keep the
pace going pretty fast.

00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:49.080
So even though it is 18 minutes, I think it
feels shorter--maybe like ten minutes hopefully.

00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:50.080
[laughter]

00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:51.690
That's my argument to any film festivals.

00:16:51.690 --> 00:16:52.690
[laughter]

00:16:52.690 --> 00:16:53.690
Yeah.

00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:58.240
&gt;&gt;MALE #9: I'm curious what the dynamic is
like for you watching your movie in a room

00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:00.140
with people who have never seen it before.

00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:04.240
Like, did they laugh at the right--?

00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:05.240
[laughter]

00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:08.970
Or had there been things where you expected
it to be felt one way and it wasn't?

00:17:08.970 --> 00:17:09.970
Or--?

00:17:09.970 --> 00:17:13.230
&gt;&gt;Doug Hannah: It's always really refreshing
'cause I'm definitely my worst critic.

00:17:13.230 --> 00:17:16.750
So, it's like, one editor explains it to me.

00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:22.180
Whenever I edit any episode--this film especially--I
know where all the dead bodies are hidden,

00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:25.011
meaning I know all the little cheats I did.

00:17:25.011 --> 00:17:28.500
I know all the bad stuff that was there that
I cut out.

00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:32.330
So, it's like watching something, it's sometimes
really painful.

00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:35.840
But watching it with an audience is really
refreshing and nice.

00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:38.460
And I say, "Oh, there is a joke there.

00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:39.720
It is funny."

00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:43.310
&gt;&gt;MALE #9: You don't think anybody spotted
the palm tree?

00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:44.310
&gt;&gt;Doug Hannah: Yeah.

00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:46.210
No one spotted the palm tree.

00:17:46.210 --> 00:17:47.210
Exactly.

00:17:47.210 --> 00:17:48.810
Yeah, so no.

00:17:48.810 --> 00:17:50.040
It's always really nice to watch.

00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:55.760
I mean, this isn't quite huge, but it's always
fun for me to see it on the big screen like

00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:56.760
that.

00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:57.760
It's pretty cool.

00:17:57.760 --> 00:17:58.760
Yeah, in the back.

00:17:58.760 --> 00:17:59.760
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #10: So, not knowing
much about the film industry, I'm curious

00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:00.760
what you do to maximize viewership of an 18-minute
film?

00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:01.760
I think a bunch of things.

00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:06.020
There's traditional distribution routes.

00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:16.010
There's putting it up on YouTube and making
money off the ads.

00:18:16.010 --> 00:18:21.100
You do what Louis CK did and just make a free
download and sell your movie for like, three

00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:22.100
bucks or whatever.

00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:23.100
&gt;&gt;Doug Hannah: Yeah.

00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:24.100
&gt;&gt;MALE : #10: I really enjoyed it.

00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:29.990
I'd love to be able to get other people seeing
it, but short of doing some research to figure

00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:35.750
out which film festival it'll be at next,
I don't know how to help you with your art.

00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:37.030
&gt;&gt;Doug Hannah: Yeah, yeah.

00:18:37.030 --> 00:18:39.630
Well, that's a great question.

00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:41.220
[laughter]

00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:47.040
I guess I'll take the long answer to get there.

00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:53.690
The original goal of making it, despite wanting
to make it, was just for my own practice as

00:18:53.690 --> 00:18:57.630
an editor trying to be a director.

00:18:57.630 --> 00:19:00.490
And then the next step was I was getting it
out there.

00:19:00.490 --> 00:19:06.940
And so the festival route was just a way to
get it in front of as many big audiences possible.

00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:12.350
And unfortunately, because I'm going the festival
route, I can't put it online yet.

00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:17.410
That's like a clause that pretty much every
festival is, it can't be online anywhere.

00:19:17.410 --> 00:19:20.960
So I mean, we're gonna be wrapping up the
whole festival circuit around October of this

00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:21.960
year.

00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:28.880
And then I guess I'll start thinking of the
next thing of how to get it out to an even

00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:29.880
bigger audience.

00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:34.100
&gt;&gt;MALE #11: It's movie channels like HBO or
Showtime?

00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:35.560
&gt;&gt;Doug Hannah: Like IFC or stuff like that.

00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:40.820
They show shorts, but most of the time it's
ones that have gone on to win Sundance and--

00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:41.860
&gt;&gt;MALE #11: OK.

00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:47.130
&gt;&gt;Doug Hannah: which we're not quite at that
level unfortunately.

00:19:47.130 --> 00:19:49.880
So I guess the answer would be just please
stand by--

00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:52.770
[Doug Hannah laughs]

00:19:52.770 --> 00:19:56.830
and it will be out online come October.

00:19:56.830 --> 00:19:58.900
It'll be more widely available.

00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:03.760
It is online now, but you have to know a password.

00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:06.790
And maybe if you come by after, I'll tell
you it.

00:20:06.790 --> 00:20:07.790
[laughter]

00:20:07.790 --> 00:20:11.250
&gt;&gt;MALE #12: Is there a list of where it will
be screened?

00:20:11.250 --> 00:20:14.980
&gt;&gt;Doug Hannah: The next one is next weekend
in Denver, like I said.

00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:20.600
And then after that, we're still waiting to
hear from about I think like, 20 more fests,

00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:21.700
possibly.

00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:22.810
We submitted to about 60.

00:20:22.810 --> 00:20:23.810
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #3: [inaudible]

00:20:23.810 --> 00:20:24.840
&gt;&gt;Doug Hannah: It's been an eight so far.

00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:26.170
&gt;&gt;MALE #13: And you have to pay to get yourself
there from those, or--?

00:20:26.170 --> 00:20:27.650
&gt;&gt;Doug Hannah: Yeah, technically, to get to
the festivals and stuff.

00:20:27.650 --> 00:20:29.910
And just depending on the festival.

00:20:29.910 --> 00:20:31.800
Some get you out there.

00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:33.300
Some put you up.

00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:35.180
A whole variation of stuff.

00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:36.180
Yeah?

00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:37.740
&gt;&gt;MALE #14: The comment you said about to
some extent about being a director.

00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:38.740
&gt;&gt;Doug Hannah: Yeah.

00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:39.840
&gt;&gt;MALE #14: Do you like that it was great
practice?

00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:49.140
Like, do you feel like you're in a better
spot now to do something else, and you have

00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:52.330
other projects now because of this?

00:20:52.330 --> 00:20:53.920
&gt;&gt;Doug Hannah: Yeah.

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:54.920
Absolutely.

00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:56.470
It was great practice.

00:20:56.470 --> 00:21:01.450
It definitely showed me my weaknesses, which
was working with actors.

00:21:01.450 --> 00:21:02.450
[chuckles]

00:21:02.450 --> 00:21:09.140
And so, I've been able to take a proactive
approach to it then.

00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:15.340
Now I'm taking lots of classes and that type
of stuff and talking to more actors and that

00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:16.340
type of stuff.

00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:20.010
And yeah, I learned a ton.

00:21:20.010 --> 00:21:22.420
My producer would always give me a hard time.

00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:26.100
I'd be like, "Oh, let's try this line or that
size lines.

00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:27.100
No, wait.

00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:28.100
Maybe let's switch.

00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:29.100
OK.

00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:30.100
Let's switch back."

00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:31.100
She'd say, "Oh, first time director."

00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:32.100
[laughter]

00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:34.250
And poked me a little bit.

00:21:34.250 --> 00:21:36.530
So, just as much practice as possible.

00:21:36.530 --> 00:21:42.090
I've been shadowing a lot directors on other
hour-long dramas, one's that I've edited episodes

00:21:42.090 --> 00:21:46.170
of, just to get as much experience on set
as possible.

00:21:46.170 --> 00:21:50.150
Having edited, I have that whole side of it
locked down right.

00:21:50.150 --> 00:21:51.150
I know angles.

00:21:51.150 --> 00:21:57.780
I know what I need at this point, but it's
more of the on-set, day-to-day stuff.

00:21:57.780 --> 00:22:03.780
And then in terms of future projects, there's
a whole bunch of ideas, writers I've been

00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:05.900
talking to.

00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:10.870
And the plan is I edit a pilot for the same
creator as White Collar in March, and then

00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:12.790
I go on to do the next season of White Collar.

00:22:12.790 --> 00:22:15.270
Then, I’ll have time off again in October.

00:22:15.270 --> 00:22:20.900
So I'm hoping to prep something while I'm
working and then shoot something hopefully

00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:22.240
next October--another short.

00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:25.720
And then go from there.

00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:29.230
Any other questions?

00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:30.400
Yes.

00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:33.910
&gt;&gt;MALE #15: Yeah.

00:22:33.910 --> 00:22:41.200
So I guess this is a piggy-back on Seth's
comment earlier of do they laugh at the right

00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:42.200
time and whatnot.

00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:43.200
&gt;&gt;Doug Hannah: Yeah.

00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:45.280
&gt;&gt;MALE #15: And I think probably what I wanna
say was the audience fairly different in many

00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:46.280
different ways?

00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:47.650
Who would you describe as your target customer?

00:22:47.650 --> 00:22:49.460
Every movie is a piece of your advertising
you're selling to someone.

00:22:49.460 --> 00:22:50.460
In this regard, to box offices.

00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:51.480
You didn't have the luxury of a big production
studio--

00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:52.480
&gt;&gt;Doug Hannah: Mm-hmm.

00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:53.480
&gt;&gt;MALE #15: working behind you.

00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:55.220
You did some research and said, "This is what
the people of America want right now."

00:22:55.220 --> 00:23:00.100
How do figure that out and how is it hard
at making a short as an independent filmmaker

00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:06.250
to know is this gonna be funny to everyone
or is just my group of 25 working on this

00:23:06.250 --> 00:23:07.870
that's gonna think it's hilarious?

00:23:07.870 --> 00:23:08.870
&gt;&gt;Doug Hannah: Yeah.

00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:09.870
Yeah.

00:23:09.870 --> 00:23:14.140
I guess ultimately, we wanted to open it up
to everybody.

00:23:14.140 --> 00:23:19.170
And that's why I was sensitive when it came
like poking fun at Tea Partiers or something

00:23:19.170 --> 00:23:23.050
like that, or liberals or conservatives or
whatever.

00:23:23.050 --> 00:23:27.120
And I just wanted everyone to enjoy it.

00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:29.711
As in the specific age, I guess I can't--.

00:23:29.711 --> 00:23:33.680
Ultimately, I wanted everyone to love it.

00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:41.430
But I mean, it was based off of my sensibility,
so it's probably gonna be more geared younger--not

00:23:41.430 --> 00:23:44.730
to say that only young people will get it.

00:23:44.730 --> 00:23:48.660
But for example, my mom watched it and she
just watched it with a friend of hers and

00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:52.300
she didn't get that it was a comedy.

00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:53.300
[laughter]

00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:56.260
&gt;&gt;MALE #16: It was a tragedy?

00:23:56.260 --> 00:23:57.790
&gt;&gt;Doug Hannah: Yeah.

00:23:57.790 --> 00:24:01.030
She said that she didn't like the swears in
it.

00:24:01.030 --> 00:24:02.030
[laughter]

00:24:02.030 --> 00:24:07.960
So, that's something that I don't always think
about, that excluding people just by having

00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:13.450
the F-word in it a bunch of times and that
people will tune out because they don't like

00:24:13.450 --> 00:24:14.890
that type of language.

00:24:14.890 --> 00:24:20.100
And that's hard for me to remember.

00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:24.810
But it's something that now I'm more aware
of.

00:24:24.810 --> 00:24:25.810
But yeah.

00:24:25.810 --> 00:24:29.630
So I guess ultimately, I hope everyone will
get it, but I realize that not everyone will.

00:24:29.630 --> 00:24:31.120
&gt;&gt;MALE #17: Was there a trade-off where you
realized that between different demographics

00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:32.120
you're going to do different themes--

00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:33.120
&gt;&gt;Doug Hannah: Yeah.

00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:39.730
&gt;&gt;MALE #17: and was it pretty hard to make
a movie if you want it perfect to your passion

00:24:39.730 --> 00:24:42.910
it's gonna appeal to all those demographics
and like sector-graphics?

00:24:42.910 --> 00:24:44.170
&gt;&gt;Doug Hannah: Yeah.

00:24:44.170 --> 00:24:48.670
Ultimately, I just feel like I have to make
a move that I myself get.

00:24:48.670 --> 00:24:55.320
And I have to play to my sensibilities 'cause
if I'm trying to make a movie for 60-year

00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:57.870
olds, I'm not gonna be able to do it.

00:24:57.870 --> 00:24:59.820
I just don't--.

00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:04.809
I could think I know what they would want,
but ultimately, I would probably be way off

00:25:04.809 --> 00:25:06.480
I would think.

00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:07.480
Maybe.

00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:13.309
Maybe I'm not giving myself enough credit,
but it's just not what I'm comfortable with

00:25:13.309 --> 00:25:14.309
working in.

00:25:14.309 --> 00:25:15.309
Yeah?

00:25:15.309 --> 00:25:20.070
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #4: So again, not being at all familiar
with the industry, and now hearing you talk

00:25:20.070 --> 00:25:25.100
about taking a script and making choices,
can you describe in a little more detail your

00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:34.176
role, what you were personally doing and responsible
for and a little bit what your day-to-day

00:25:34.176 --> 00:25:35.176
looks like?

00:25:35.176 --> 00:25:36.176
&gt;&gt;Doug Hannah: Yeah.

00:25:36.176 --> 00:25:37.176
Totally.

00:25:37.176 --> 00:25:39.010
And if I use words that seem a little out
there, it's--.

00:25:39.010 --> 00:25:43.020
Like my sister said in the introduction, I've
been doing this stuff since I was like 15,

00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:44.020
seriously.

00:25:44.020 --> 00:25:48.020
So sometimes I use terminology that I don't
even realize is "in" terminology.

00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:51.640
But I'm just used to using it.

00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:58.000
So, as a director starting with the script,
when I first got it, I first just read it

00:25:58.000 --> 00:25:59.090
just to enjoy it.

00:25:59.090 --> 00:26:00.870
But after that, it's like, "All right.

00:26:00.870 --> 00:26:02.460
Which parts were working for me?

00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:04.390
Which parts weren't totally working?

00:26:04.390 --> 00:26:05.450
What did I get?

00:26:05.450 --> 00:26:06.970
What parts didn't I really get?"

00:26:06.970 --> 00:26:10.510
And then I started just by asking questions
of the writer.

00:26:10.510 --> 00:26:11.930
What were we meaning here?

00:26:11.930 --> 00:26:15.290
Could we try maybe something here?

00:26:15.290 --> 00:26:20.170
And then, as it got shaped more specifically,
I was adding jokes.

00:26:20.170 --> 00:26:24.050
I just wanted to add more to the comedy.

00:26:24.050 --> 00:26:29.400
And then further along, as I started going
through the script and deciding camera angles

00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:36.090
and really looking at transitions of how are
we getting from this scene to the next scene.

00:26:36.090 --> 00:26:40.980
And so it was at that point where for example,
I knew I was gonna wanna come out of TV monitors,

00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:44.220
go across, and go into the next monitor.

00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:49.050
And I thought that would be a real organic
way to get from one scene to another.

00:26:49.050 --> 00:26:57.150
So, I then had her add lines to help cover
those transitions--those little bumpers, "Up

00:26:57.150 --> 00:26:59.410
next on OK Action News."

00:26:59.410 --> 00:27:01.530
I had her add those.

00:27:01.530 --> 00:27:05.260
Actually, we had about a page and a half and
at the end of that shoot day, we just had

00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:09.270
them stand next to each other and go through
and do all of them.

00:27:09.270 --> 00:27:10.529
Yeah, do all of them.

00:27:10.529 --> 00:27:13.630
And I knew I was gonna probably wanna sprinkle
that throughout.

00:27:13.630 --> 00:27:17.350
At that point I didn't exactly know where
I was gonna put 'em.

00:27:17.350 --> 00:27:19.350
I just knew I wanted some extra material.

00:27:19.350 --> 00:27:23.240
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #4: That whole editor perspective.

00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:25.190
&gt;&gt;Doug Hannah: Yeah.

00:27:25.190 --> 00:27:31.400
So, that's part of the script-writing, but
in terms of like, how the words were spoken,

00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:36.929
the whole structure, she really was instrumental
in that.

00:27:36.929 --> 00:27:41.090
And I was trying to cut the script down 'cause
I wanted as many days to shoot as little as

00:27:41.090 --> 00:27:42.090
possible.

00:27:42.090 --> 00:27:43.260
So I was like, "Oh, do we really need that?

00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:44.260
Do we need that?"

00:27:44.260 --> 00:27:49.120
And for example, I was I guess, really wanting
her to cut that nighttime scene.

00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:50.120
I was like, "We don't need it.

00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:51.640
We have all this information already."

00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:52.980
And she really fought for it.

00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:56.440
And then as it turns out, we needed that scene
really badly.

00:27:56.440 --> 00:28:00.940
Otherwise, the whole pace--I think people
just wouldn't even understand what the movie

00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:02.360
was about without it.

00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:07.230
And so, it was that writer mentality more
that I'm lacking in experience that helped

00:28:07.230 --> 00:28:08.470
a lot.

00:28:08.470 --> 00:28:12.190
&gt;&gt;MALE #18: So, does the writer hate you now?

00:28:12.190 --> 00:28:13.190
[laughter]

00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:15.290
&gt;&gt;Doug Hannah: No, she does not hate me, luckily.

00:28:15.290 --> 00:28:16.290
&gt;&gt;MALE #18: [inaudible ]

00:28:16.290 --> 00:28:21.200
&gt;&gt;Doug Hannah: Wait for her Q and A and maybe
she'll say differently.

00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:26.870
No, she's very good with notes and I think
working in professional, hour-long dramas,

00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:33.840
you have to be good with taking creative criticism
or constructive criticism.

00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:41.580
And then just going onto the set, it's choosing
the angles with your DP and then honing the

00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:42.940
performances in.

00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:46.490
Oh, Director of Photography, with whoever
is shooting it.

00:28:46.490 --> 00:28:52.130
&gt;&gt;MALE #19: You said two cameras, so there's
two people operating cameras, plus a DP.

00:28:52.130 --> 00:28:53.260
&gt;&gt;Doug Hannah: Yeah.

00:28:53.260 --> 00:28:55.670
And then in addition to that, there's two
focus pullers.

00:28:55.670 --> 00:28:58.429
So, the camera operators don't even deal with
the focus.

00:28:58.429 --> 00:29:02.960
So per camera, there's two people.

00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:08.420
And then the DP is--the Director of Photography--is
with me at the monitors, watching two of the

00:29:08.420 --> 00:29:09.420
monitors.

00:29:09.420 --> 00:29:10.760
So you have your A-camera and B-camera.

00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:16.010
So, you're watching both at the same time,
which is nice 'cause then you can do cross-coverage

00:29:16.010 --> 00:29:17.950
of the actors that are improvising and stuff.

00:29:17.950 --> 00:29:21.000
You have close-ups on both of them.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:22.210
Although, we were sharing--.

00:29:22.210 --> 00:29:24.460
We had two cameras, but one lens package.

00:29:24.460 --> 00:29:31.540
Meaning, we couldn't just zoom in like on
a video camera, your different sized lenses.

00:29:31.540 --> 00:29:34.180
And to cut costs, we were only using one lens
package.

00:29:34.180 --> 00:29:40.210
So, we couldn't ever do two close-ups the
exact same size since we didn't have two of

00:29:40.210 --> 00:29:41.350
the same lenses.

00:29:41.350 --> 00:29:42.350
Yeah.

00:29:42.350 --> 00:29:44.870
&gt;&gt;MALE #20: So you said that you needed the
scene at night and stuff.

00:29:44.870 --> 00:29:51.540
Did you try a different version of the movie,
different version of the short with different

00:29:51.540 --> 00:29:54.360
audiences to see how they reacted to the scene,
the life of the scene?

00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:57.750
&gt;&gt;Doug Hannah: If I had more time, I probably
would've started doing that, showing it to

00:29:57.750 --> 00:30:00.300
bigger audiences.

00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:04.050
A film I had done in college was a documentary
and I showed it to a lot of people and got

00:30:04.050 --> 00:30:05.050
a lot of notes.

00:30:05.050 --> 00:30:09.070
And I found my head just got clouded where
I didn't even know which notes to listen to

00:30:09.070 --> 00:30:11.810
and which notes not to listen to at that point.

00:30:11.810 --> 00:30:18.992
So with this film, I took a different approach
and really kept it very small where I just

00:30:18.992 --> 00:30:26.210
only had maybe a dozen people all together
look at it--people I've worked with and stuff

00:30:26.210 --> 00:30:28.650
like that.

00:30:28.650 --> 00:30:34.530
And I really kept the creative part of the
editing only took two weeks, so the first

00:30:34.530 --> 00:30:41.700
week I did my cut, showed it to some people,
did some notes, showed it to a couple more

00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:44.360
people, did a few more notes.

00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:50.070
I knew I would keep editing it for months
and months if I kept showing it to more and

00:30:50.070 --> 00:30:51.070
more people.

00:30:51.070 --> 00:30:54.210
So, I kept it small, closed it, and said,
"All right.

00:30:54.210 --> 00:30:55.480
Time to move on."

00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:58.929
So I wasn't really trying to respond to a
lot of different people's ideas.

00:30:58.929 --> 00:30:59.929
Yeah?

00:30:59.929 --> 00:31:04.350
&gt;&gt;MALE #21: What was the total amount of footage
recorded between the two cameras that you

00:31:04.350 --> 00:31:06.740
had cut down to, ultimately, the 18 minutes?

00:31:06.740 --> 00:31:12.090
&gt;&gt;Doug Hannah: I don't totally know.

00:31:12.090 --> 00:31:16.940
I would guess I was probably shooting about
three hours a day.

00:31:16.940 --> 00:31:20.550
So, probably about 15 hours of footage.

00:31:20.550 --> 00:31:22.310
I wasn't doing a ton of takes.

00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:28.570
I was probably doing about two or three takes
per set-up, meaning for each size, each position

00:31:28.570 --> 00:31:32.309
where the camera was in, up to three times
like that.

00:31:32.309 --> 00:31:33.700
But we were moving pretty fast.

00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:35.940
We were trying to really stick to that TV
schedule of just going and going.

00:31:35.940 --> 00:31:42.890
&gt;&gt;MALE #22: So for one scene, you would then
shoot it with several different camera set-ups?

00:31:42.890 --> 00:31:46.330
&gt;&gt;Doug Hannah: Exactly.

00:31:46.330 --> 00:31:53.240
So, every time I go to a different angle,
every time it cuts, I shot from that angle

00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:57.740
for the entire scene most of the time, even
if I only go to it for two seconds, three

00:31:57.740 --> 00:31:59.130
seconds or whatever.

00:31:59.130 --> 00:32:03.990
I have that option of going to it whenever.

00:32:03.990 --> 00:32:04.990
Yeah?

00:32:04.990 --> 00:32:08.770
&gt;&gt;MALE #23: What's the role of a producer?

00:32:08.770 --> 00:32:09.890
&gt;&gt;Doug Hannah: Good question.

00:32:09.890 --> 00:32:12.840
There's tons of different kinds of producers
and it can mean a whole bunch of things.

00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:21.960
For the case of this short, our producer was
anything we needed, she was helping coordinate.

00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:24.880
So, our casting calls, our location.

00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:31.470
She was negotiating with the owners of those
locations of how much we would spend on it.

00:32:31.470 --> 00:32:34.630
Our camera rentals, hiring all our crew.

00:32:34.630 --> 00:32:37.870
It was really a huge job to undertake.

00:32:37.870 --> 00:32:41.150
It's more of like the managerial side, I guess
you could say.

00:32:41.150 --> 00:32:45.950
But it's still creative because you're still
doing those creative choices, just in a more

00:32:45.950 --> 00:32:48.620
managerial standpoint I guess.

00:32:48.620 --> 00:32:50.300
That would be like a line producer.

00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:56.950
An executive producer sometimes just oversees
it all more, supplies the money sometimes.

00:32:56.950 --> 00:32:58.180
It can mean a whole bunch of things.

00:32:58.180 --> 00:32:59.180
Yeah?

00:32:59.180 --> 00:33:02.460
&gt;&gt;MALE #24: So at the end it's something in
an author of production.

00:33:02.460 --> 00:33:03.460
&gt;&gt;Doug Hannah: Yeah.

00:33:03.460 --> 00:33:05.420
&gt;&gt;MALE #24: Did you form a production company
for this?

00:33:05.420 --> 00:33:06.630
&gt;&gt;Doug Hannah: Yeah.

00:33:06.630 --> 00:33:12.440
We kinda just formed it just so when we were
signing out and renting equipment and stuff.

00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:17.020
&gt;&gt;MALE #24: Is that normal for a short like
this to form a company?

00:33:17.020 --> 00:33:18.090
&gt;&gt;Doug Hannah: Yeah.

00:33:18.090 --> 00:33:21.120
Since it was my first one, we just--.

00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:23.360
We were like, "Hannah-Powell Productions."

00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:26.590
We just put it together really fast since
we on such a tight schedule.

00:33:26.590 --> 00:33:32.020
At this point I have a production company
now that's actually incorporated and everything.

00:33:32.020 --> 00:33:33.390
So for the future, I'll use that.

00:33:33.390 --> 00:33:38.100
But this one, we just put it together really
fast.

00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:40.880
Opened a business bank account and started
going.

00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:41.880
Yeah?

00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:45.200
&gt;&gt;MALE #25: Do you plan to just stick to shorts?

00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:46.380
&gt;&gt;Doug Hannah: No.

00:33:46.380 --> 00:33:48.890
Ideally, I'd wanna do a feature.

00:33:48.890 --> 00:33:51.100
It's just obviously more money, more time.

00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:54.300
And I do hope to get to that point shortly.

00:33:54.300 --> 00:33:55.380
We just--.

00:33:55.380 --> 00:34:00.100
I feel like one more short would be good for
me.

00:34:00.100 --> 00:34:04.990
Just one more time to practice with actors,
use some of the techniques I've been learning

00:34:04.990 --> 00:34:12.670
in my directing classes and stuff like that,
unless a feature option came my way.

00:34:12.670 --> 00:34:13.740
[laughter]

00:34:13.740 --> 00:34:19.260
But it just seems like another, just one more
short just to knock it out quickly.

00:34:19.260 --> 00:34:21.560
And then, before I tackle a feature.

00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:23.840
But a feature would be a ton of fun to do.

00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:29.619
&gt;&gt;MALE #25: Do these tend to be like your
resume for the people who are thinking about

00:34:29.619 --> 00:34:30.860
hiring directors?

00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:32.730
&gt;&gt;Doug Hannah: Yeah.

00:34:32.730 --> 00:34:37.310
Hopefully though this, a show that I edit
or something will bring me on and I can negotiate

00:34:37.310 --> 00:34:39.150
an episode to direct from this.

00:34:39.150 --> 00:34:43.030
And at least I have, then, stuff under my
belt.

00:34:43.030 --> 00:34:49.510
It's nice now that I have a short, I can say
I am a director as opposed to "I want to direct."

00:34:49.510 --> 00:34:51.770
At least I've done something.

00:34:51.770 --> 00:34:54.340
Is there any other questions?

00:34:54.340 --> 00:34:57.640
No one wants to go to work?

00:34:57.640 --> 00:34:59.800
Well, thank you guys so much.

00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:00.800
It was great.

00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:01.800
Thank you.

00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:01.801
[applause]
