00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:09.398
Between 2008 and 2012,

00:00:09.398 --> 00:00:13.591
archeologists excavated the rubble
of an ancient hospital in England.

00:00:13.591 --> 00:00:16.950
In the process, they uncovered
a number of skeletons.

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:19.130
One in particular belonged 
to a wealthy male

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:21.570
who lived in the 11th or 12th century

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.411
and died of leprosy between 
the ages of 18 and 25.

00:00:25.411 --> 00:00:26.960
How do we know all this?

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.041
Simply by examining some old,
soil-caked bones?

00:00:30.041 --> 00:00:31.669
Even centuries after death,

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:35.400
skeletons carry unique features
that tell us about their identities.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.541
And using modern tools and techniques,
we can read those features as clues.

00:00:39.541 --> 00:00:43.581
This is a branch of science known as
biological anthropology.

00:00:43.581 --> 00:00:47.167
It allows researchers to piece together 
details about ancient individuals

00:00:47.167 --> 00:00:51.301
and identify historical events
that affected whole populations.

00:00:51.301 --> 00:00:53.708
When researchers uncover a skeleton,

00:00:53.708 --> 00:00:56.915
some of the first clues they gather,
like age and gender,

00:00:56.915 --> 00:00:58.647
lie in its morphology,

00:00:58.647 --> 00:01:02.407
which is the structure, appearance,
and size of a skeleton.

00:01:02.407 --> 00:01:05.715
Bones, like the clavicle, 
stop growing at age 25,

00:01:05.715 --> 00:01:08.627
so a skeleton with a clavicle
that hasn't fully formed

00:01:08.627 --> 00:01:10.560
must be younger than that.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.768
Similarly, the plates in the cranium
can continue fusing up to age 40,

00:01:14.768 --> 00:01:17.189
and sometimes beyond.

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.480
By combining these with some 
microscopic skeletal clues,

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:25.314
physical anthropologists can estimate
an approximate age of death.

00:01:25.314 --> 00:01:27.890
Meanwhile, pelvic bones reveal gender.

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.015
Biologically, female pelvises are wider,
allowing women to give birth,

00:01:32.015 --> 00:01:34.186
where as males are narrower.

00:01:34.186 --> 00:01:36.675
Bones also betray the signs 
of ancient disease.

00:01:36.675 --> 00:01:39.806
Disorders like anemia leave their traces
on the bones.

00:01:39.806 --> 00:01:42.306
And the condition of teeth 
can reveal clues

00:01:42.306 --> 00:01:44.695
to factors like diet and malnutrition,

00:01:44.695 --> 00:01:47.836
which sometimes correlate with wealth
or poverty.

00:01:47.836 --> 00:01:52.115
A protein called collagen can give us
even more profound details.

00:01:52.115 --> 00:01:53.336
The air we breathe,

00:01:53.336 --> 00:01:54.357
water we drink,

00:01:54.357 --> 00:01:55.616
and food we eat

00:01:55.616 --> 00:01:58.287
leaves permanent traces 
in our bones and teeth

00:01:58.287 --> 00:02:00.437
in the form of chemical compounds.

00:02:00.437 --> 00:02:03.888
These compounds contain measurable
quantities called isotopes.

00:02:03.888 --> 00:02:09.028
Stable isotopes in bone collagen
and tooth enamel varies among mammals

00:02:09.028 --> 00:02:12.117
dependent on where they lived
and what they ate.

00:02:12.117 --> 00:02:13.906
So by analyzing these isotopes,

00:02:13.906 --> 00:02:18.457
we can draw direct inferences regarding 
the diet and location of historic people.

00:02:18.457 --> 00:02:20.747
Not only that, but during life,

00:02:20.747 --> 00:02:23.858
bones undergo a constant cycle
of remodeling.

00:02:23.858 --> 00:02:26.207
So if someone moves from one place
to another,

00:02:26.207 --> 00:02:28.131
bones synthesized after that move

00:02:28.131 --> 00:02:32.684
will also reflect the new isotopic 
signatures of the surrounding environment.

00:02:32.684 --> 00:02:36.257
That means that skeletons can be used
like migratory maps.

00:02:36.257 --> 00:02:40.026
For instance, between 1-650 AD,

00:02:40.026 --> 00:02:44.987
the great city of Teotihuacan in Mexico
bustled with thousands of people.

00:02:44.987 --> 00:02:48.640
Researchers examined the isotope ratios
in skeletons' tooth enamel,

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.047
which held details of their diets
when they were young.

00:02:52.047 --> 00:02:54.860
They found evidence for significant
migration into the city.

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.495
A majority of the individuals
were born elsewhere.

00:02:57.495 --> 00:03:01.089
With further geological 
and skeletal analysis,

00:03:01.089 --> 00:03:04.950
they may be able to map where
those people came from.

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.201
That work in Teotihuacan is also
an example of how bio-anthropologists

00:03:09.201 --> 00:03:11.951
study skeletons in cemeteries 
and mass graves,

00:03:11.951 --> 00:03:14.711
then analyze their similarities 
and differences.

00:03:14.711 --> 00:03:17.640
From that information, they can learn
about cultural beliefs,

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:18.371
social norms,

00:03:18.371 --> 00:03:19.119
wars,

00:03:19.119 --> 00:03:21.321
and what caused their deaths.

00:03:21.321 --> 00:03:25.500
Today, we use these tools to answer
big questions about how forces,

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:26.829
like migration and disease,

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:28.742
shape the modern world.

00:03:28.742 --> 00:03:33.920
DNA analysis is even possible in some
relatively well-preserved ancient remains.

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:37.021
That's helping us understand how diseases
like tuberculosis

00:03:37.021 --> 00:03:39.062
have evolved over the centuries

00:03:39.062 --> 00:03:42.420
so we can build better treatments
for people today.

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.111
Ancient skeletons can tell us a
surprisingly great deal about the past.

00:03:46.111 --> 00:03:48.722
So if your remains are someday 
buried intact,

00:03:48.722 --> 00:03:52.011
what might archeologists 
of the distant future learn from them?
