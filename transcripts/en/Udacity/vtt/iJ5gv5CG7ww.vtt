00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
We said that when we want to lift a 100 kg or 1000 N rock by 1 m,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
We have at least a couple of ways to do it.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
With a single simple pulley, we just have to pull with the force of 1000 N over a distance of 1 m.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
For a compound pulley with two attachment points, we call that a double pulley,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
we have to pull with a force of 500 N over a distance of 2 m.

00:00:21.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Can you complete this table for the case of a triple and a quadruple pulley?
