00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.190
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress, in Washington D.C.

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:07.400
&gt;&gt; Petra Mayer: I'm so excited.

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.930
I mean I would have run here
anyways to interview Gene Yang

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:12.600
because he's one of my
favorite comic artists.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.690
But a little bit of
housekeeping before we begin.

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.210
Thank you so much everyone
for coming

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.510
out to the National Book Festival
today and thank you to the Library

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:21.810
of Congress for continuing

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.180
to host this awesome
festival of book nerdery.

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.480
I'm Petra Mayer.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.530
In addition to being very out
of breath I am also the editor

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:31.730
of NPR books and we're also media
partners for this year's festival.

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.760 position:56%
I'd also like to thank the festivals
co-chairman David Rubenstein

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.390 position:56%
and all the many sponsors who helped

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.010
to make it happen this
year and every year.

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.070
Now I'm sure you have
all already done this,

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:44.880
but if you could turn
your cell phones off.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.340
There will be time for
questions afterwards.

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.860
Just be aware that if you
do get up to ask a question,

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:50.930
you will be filmed for
the library's archives.

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.550
So on to the main event.

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.910
I'm so excited to be here
today introducing Gene Yang

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.430
like I said one of my favorite --
you've got some fans out there,

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:03.540
one of my favorite comic
and graphic novel creators.

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.200
He's done so much cool
stuff that I'm going

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.690
to have a little trouble
just cramming it all

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.300
into the three minute
introduction they told us to do.

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.500
But I'll give it a go.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.140
Gene's graphic novel American
Born Chinese came out in 2006

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.140
and won just about every
award there was to win.

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.230
It's a lovely book that weaves
together three separate stories

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:25.160
into a funny and profound
meditation on identity belonging

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.390 position:56%
in the Chinese immigrant experience.

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.330
Identity and belonging are themes
that come up a lot in Gene's work.

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.710
His epic two part graphic novel
Boxers and Saints was a finalist

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:35.980
for the National Book Award 2013.

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:38.300
It's the story of China's
Boxer Rebellion told

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.130
from two different perspectives.

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.260
A young boy who believes that
China's ods and hero's are fighting

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.470
with him against Christian and
western imperial influences

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.700
and a girl who converts to
Catholicism after being rejected

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.290
by the people around her and
who sees visions of Joan of Arc.

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:54.840
He's a big fan of super hero's too.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.190
After taking on the Boxer Rebellion
he created a back story for one

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.830
of the first Asian-American
super hero's the green turtle

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:05.710
in the 2014 graphic novel, novel
-- excuse me The Shadow Hero.

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.660
Gene has also spent many
years teaching high school

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:09.960
where he discovered the roll
comics played in education

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.320
as a substitute math
teacher he made comics

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:13.900 position:56%
to explain algebra for his students.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.780
And I believe it was on this
festival stage a couple years ago

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.020
that you were called your teacher
saying Mr. Yang you're kind

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.030
of boring in person but
we love you in comics."

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.330
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: That's right.

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:23.630
That's exactly right.

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:24.930
&gt;&gt; Petra Mayer: So the Library

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.230
of Congress has recognized
Gene's commitment

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.420
to education earlier this year when
they named him their ambassador

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.240
for young people's literature.

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.670
His latest book is Secret Coders
Paths and Portals, which is a part

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.640
of a series that teaches kids
basic computer programming.

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.740
I'm going to turn the page now.

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:44.210
Basic computer programming concepts
as part of a fun adventure story.

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:47.020
He's also writing and this is
very cool the new superman series

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:50.460
for DC Comics featuring the
Chinese hero Kenan Kong.

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:51.760
Did I say that right?

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.060
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: That's right.

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.360
&gt;&gt; Petra Mayer: Okay

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.660
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yep.

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:56.960
&gt;&gt; Petra Mayer: And last
but definitely not least,

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.260
you may have heard a
couple days ago he's one

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:59.560
of this year's MacArthur
Genius Grants recipients.

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:00.860
So.

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.160
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Thank you.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.460
[ Applause ]

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:04.760
&gt;&gt; Petra Mayer: Please
welcome artist, writer,

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.840
and certified super
genius Gene Yang.

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.240 position:56%
Congratulations on the genius grant.

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:10.540
I mean that's amazing.

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:11.840
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang:
Oh it's mind blowing.

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.310
I feel like my mind is still numb.

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:14.610
It's a, it's been a shock.

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.760
&gt;&gt; Petra Mayer: I'm
trying to resist asking you

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.380
if you're going to Disneyland.

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.660
But how, how will it affect
your work, do you think?

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.390
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Well
you know -- I'd so --

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:24.690
I've been thinking about it.

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.140
I, I, I found out three weeks ago.

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.780
It was one morning I was pulling

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.430
out of my driveway to
go to Panera Bread.

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.440
I go to Panera Bread to write
because I used to have a studio

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:38.530 position:56%
at my house, but then my oldest
daughter got too old to share a room

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.390
with the other two daughters.

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:42.470
So I had to give up my studio
so she could have a bedroom.

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:45.470
And since then I've just been
struggling to find a place to work.

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:46.770
&gt;&gt; Petra Mayer: Panera Bread

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:48.590
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: I go to Panera
Bread and then I get a call

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:49.890
from the MacArthur foundation.

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:52.980
They tell me this news and then
I just stayed in my driveway

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.890
for like half an hour after that.

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:58.520
I eventually did make it to Panera
Bread but I did not work at all.

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:00.380
&gt;&gt; Petra Mayer: Did you order
something really expensive?

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:01.680
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Oh no.

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.900
I ordered a cup of coffee because
I was I was half expecting one

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.590
of my friends to call me
up and go just kidding.

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:07.890
But that didn't happen.

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:09.190
That didn't happen.

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:10.490
&gt;&gt; Petra Mayer: Okay.

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:11.790
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: But I've been
thinking about it since then.

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.090
And I think -- I see myself as
having three different roles.

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:14.390
I'm a member of a family.

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:16.890
I'm a son, I'm a father
and I'm a husband.

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:18.190
I'm a cartoonist.

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:19.820
And I'm also a teacher.

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.460
And specifically I'm a, I'm a
national ambassador for, for,

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.410
for these next couple years.

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:27.560
I want to put some of the
resources in each of those roles.

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.360
&gt;&gt; Petra Mayer: So
what makes comics --

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.440
I mean The, The Library of
Congress recognized your work

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:33.760
with comics and education.

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:35.770
What do you think makes
comics such a good medium

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:37.870
for conveying information to kids?

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:39.990
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Well really
I, I mean I think different kinds

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:42.920
of information are conveyed
best in different ways.

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:46.850
And the thing about comics is
that at least in American culture

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:48.420
for decades, and decades,
and decades,

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:50.880
there education potential
just wasn't recognized.

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:55.430 position:56%
I mean it dates back to the 40's and
50's for really intermental reasons.

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:58.470
I, I don't think comics is
necessarily the best medium

00:04:58.470 --> 00:04:59.770
of communication.

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:02.210
It's the one I feel most
like heart attachment too.

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:04.590
But I don't think it's necessarily
the best one I just think it's

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:05.950
another tool in the tool box.

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:08.380
And there're specific
kinds of information

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.890
that are best communicated
through comics.

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:15.500
For instance all of you have
seen those instruction packets

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:17.050
that come with Lego sets.

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:18.350
Those are basically comics.

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:19.840
There're sequential images right?

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:23.160
And can you imagine
reading text to tell you how

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:24.850
to put together a, a Lego set.

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:26.640
It would be practically impossible.

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:31.780
And I would even argue that comics
works better than video for that.

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:33.860
Because when you're
watching a video the,

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:37.160
the person making the video isn't
necessarily going at the same rate

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.430
as you want to go to
build that Lego set.

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:41.080
So that's just a really,
really simple example.

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:42.390
&gt;&gt; Petra Mayer: I just -- can
I just say will you please

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:44.400
like design IKEA manuals?

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:45.790
That's where my brain went.

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:47.090
Right? [inaudible]

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:48.390
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yeah.

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:50.800
Yeah. They poorly, poorly
made comics I would say.

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.100
&gt;&gt; Petra Mayer: I read somewhere

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:54.900
that you had a real interesting
comment about how teaching

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:57.760
by comics allows kids
to set the rate

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:59.600
at which they take
in the information.

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:00.900
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yeah.

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:02.690
Yeah. I mean, I mean they're all
sorts of visual story telling.

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:05.470
There's comics there's
film, there's television.

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:08.980
And out of all the ones that are
out there comics is the only one

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:10.900
that doesn't actually have time.

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:12.480
Time actually doesn't
exist in comics right?

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:16.440
In a page of comics past, present
and future all sit side by side.

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:19.840
And because of that the
reader gets to decide how fast

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:23.000
or slow the information goes
from the page into their brain.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.900 position:56%
And the same is not true for
animation or, or film or television.

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:29.080
&gt;&gt; Petra Mayer: So tell me a little
bit about what you've been doing.

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:30.670
You were named ambassador
earlier this year

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:33.040
and I think your program
was reading without walls.

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:34.340
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yes.

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:35.640
&gt;&gt; Petra Mayer: Tell us about that.

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:36.940
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: So every
ambassador picks a platform

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:38.240
something that they
want to focus on.

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:39.690
For me I chose reading
without walls.

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:42.430
And by that I mean I want
kids I want everybody really

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:44.310
to explore the world
through reading.

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:45.650 position:56%
And I want them to explore the world

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:47.580
through reading in
three specific ways.

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:51.470
Number one is I want people to
pick books about people who aren't

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:54.060
like them, who don't look
like them or live like them.

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:56.250
Two I want people to
pick books about topics

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:58.300
that they might find
kind of intimidating.

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:00.550
And three I want people
to pick books in formats

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:02.280
that they don't normally
read for fun.

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:03.760
So normally you read chapter books

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:05.700
for fun I want you to
try a graphic novel.

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:07.540
And normally all you
read is graphic novels

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:09.930
like one of the kids in my home.

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:13.260
I want you to try a, a chapter
book or a, a, book in verse.

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.810
I just think there's
so much great stuff

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:17.930
out there in book format you know.

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:20.520
I want everybody to
give everything a try.

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:23.610
&gt;&gt; Petra Mayer: So well let's speak
specifically about Secret Coders

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:25.420
which I picked up the
most recent volume

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:27.990
and I thought oh God I haven't
coded since I was you know

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:31.330
in 9th grade learning logo on an
Apple II and there it was Paths

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:33.120
and Portals with the
little turtle on the front.

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:34.420
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: That's right.

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:35.720
&gt;&gt; Petra Mayer: I'm sorry.

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:37.020
I got the binary bird.

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:40.140
I figured that part out but so --
why don't you tell us a little bit

00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:42.300
about the series and
what it designed to do?

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:44.000
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Secret
Coders is a, is a like a,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.340
it's project that I've been
thinking about for a long time.

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:48.380
I taught high school
computer science for 17 years.

00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:50.750
I taught in this really visual
way so I do a lot of drawing

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:53.600
on the board and I always thought
a lot of the stuff I was doing

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:55.280
on the board would work really well

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:57.920
in sequential art form
in graphic novel format.

00:07:57.920 --> 00:07:59.640 position:56%
And Secret Coders is basically that.

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:01.760
It's me taking what I
used to do in my classroom

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:03.260
and doing it on the page.

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:07.230
I teamed up with a guy named Mike
Holmes who's incredibly talented.

00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:10.130
He worked on the Adventure
Time comic books

00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:12.580
and the Bravest Warriors
comic books before he teamed

00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:14.130
up with me on, on Secret Coders.

00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:17.510
And together we are trying to
teach kids the fundamentals

00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:20.370
of computer science through comics.

00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:23.440
And again the, the reason why
we want to do this in comics is

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:27.340
because we want to allow
students to take that information

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:29.490 position:56%
in at the rate that best suits them.

00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:32.280
We want them to be able to
reread passages if they need to.

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:34.720
&gt;&gt; Petra Mayer: Yeah I had
to reread a little bit.

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:37.330
It's been a long time since
I was working in logo.

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:38.900
So where did you get the idea?

00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:40.870
What made you think hey first

00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:42.440
of all learning computer
science is important

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:44.880
and secondly I think comics
are a great way to do that?

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:46.600
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: It,
it, it dates back to my,

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:47.900
my years in the classroom.

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:52.100
You know when I was -- when I
first took my teaching job I used

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:54.440
to tell students on the
first day of every semester

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:55.740
that I was also a cartoonist.

00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:57.550
I was involved in comics
because I thought

00:08:57.550 --> 00:08:59.460
that that would make
them think I was cool.

00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:00.760
&gt;&gt; Petra Mayer: Did it?

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:02.060
Did it work?

00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:03.360
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: I was wrong.

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:04.660
I was wrong.

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:05.960 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Petra Mayer: Drat those students.

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:07.260
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yeah.

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:08.560
They -- well this was
like the 90's right?

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:09.860
So nobody like comics
just didn't have the,

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:11.160
the cache that they do today.

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:13.200
Nobody knew who Iron Man was
let alone like Rocket Raccoon.

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:14.500
&gt;&gt; Petra Mayer: Heathens.

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:15.980
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yeah, so,
so very quickly I realized --

00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:18.570
and, and the worst part about it
is after I told them I was involved

00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:20.510
in comics, when things
got hard in my class,

00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:22.430
they would ask me comic
book related questions.

00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:23.730
They would try to get me off track.

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:25.030
They would raise their
hand and go "Mr. Yang,

00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:28.320
who do you think would win in
a fight Superman or the Hulk?"

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:30.400
So I feel like I had to keep
these two things separate.

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:33.240
I would, I would teach by
day and make comics at night.

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:35.770
And eventually they came
back together for me

00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:37.100
in this Algebra II class.

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:39.470
So one of my colleagues in
the math department had to go

00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:42.050
on long term leave I was given
his Algebra II class sub.

00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:44.180
I was the long term sub.

00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:46.730 position:56%
But I was also the school
educational technologist at the time

00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:48.190
which meant it was my job

00:09:48.190 --> 00:09:52.280 position:56%
to help other teachers work
computer stuff into their curricula.

00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:54.170
So what that meant for
this Algebra II class was

00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:57.440
that every two weeks I would
have to miss a couple of sessions

00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:59.620
because I would be in some
other classroom helping some

00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:00.920
other teacher.

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:04.900
So to make up for that I started
video-taping myself giving lectures

00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:06.200
and that was horrible.

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:07.500
My students hated it.

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:09.850
They would come up to
me and they would say

00:10:09.850 --> 00:10:11.780
"Mr. Yang we thought you
were boring in person

00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:15.200
but on video you are
just unbearable."

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:16.500
&gt;&gt; Petra Mayer: That's mean.

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:17.800
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yeah,
well teenagers you know.

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:19.100
&gt;&gt; Petra Mayer: Okay, right.

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:20.400
Still.

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:21.700
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: And, and,

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:23.000
and as a desperate second attempt
I started drawing these lessons

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.980
in comics and I would photocopy
them, I would hand them out to --

00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:27.450 position:56%
I would give them to my sub who
would hand them out to the students.

00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:30.660
And these much to my surprise
were, were kind of a hit.

00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:32.860
Like they, they preferred
me in cartoon format

00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:36.190
to like actual flesh and blood.

00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:39.870 position:56%
So, so that surprised me because I
always thought man the students grow

00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:42.560
up with screens that would
prefer to take information

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:45.380
in from a screen than
in from a page.

00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:46.680
But I was wrong.

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:49.730
They, they preferred the page
at least in, in comics format.

00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:51.450
&gt;&gt; Petra Mayer: So what kind of
feedback have you been getting?

00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:52.750
What are people saying
to you about it?

00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:54.050
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: About,
about Secret Coders?

00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:55.350 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Petra Mayer: Secret Coders, yeah.

00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:56.650
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yeah,
it, it seems like people,

00:10:56.650 --> 00:10:58.570
people are, are kind of into it.

00:10:58.570 --> 00:11:01.750
I mean there's a there's a
certain kind of nerd kid that seems

00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:03.460
to gravitate towards the series.

00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:05.670
And what I'm trying to do, is
I'm trying to get everybody in,

00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:07.230
in under the tent of coding right?

00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:08.530
Not just the nerd kids.

00:11:08.530 --> 00:11:11.140
But I did just get a, a
photo a few months ago

00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:13.710
from a mom of a first grader.

00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:16.300
And this first grader, in this
photo she was standing at the front

00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:20.740
of her class, teaching her
entire class how to read binary.

00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:22.720
And that was so gratifying to me.

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:25.700
She was using the method that I
use in Secret Coders Volume I.

00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:27.090
&gt;&gt; Petra Mayer: Which are
like these little birds

00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:28.390
and they have four eyes.

00:11:28.390 --> 00:11:29.690
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yes.

00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:30.990
&gt;&gt; Petra Mayer: They're
kind of creepy looking.

00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:32.290
Are they robot birds?

00:11:32.290 --> 00:11:33.590
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang:
They're robot birds.

00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:34.890
&gt;&gt; Petra Mayer: Yeah and they --
I didn't quite understand them.

00:11:34.890 --> 00:11:36.190
Then there was that thing with
the pennies and the graph.

00:11:36.190 --> 00:11:38.790
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: There
eyes display binary numbers.

00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:40.090
Yes.

00:11:40.090 --> 00:11:41.390
&gt;&gt; Petra Mayer: I'm sure you
guys will all understand it.

00:11:41.390 --> 00:11:43.910
It, it was a revelation to
me, to be perfectly honest.

00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:45.610
So there you go, very educational.

00:11:45.610 --> 00:11:47.550
I also want to -- but
there's a little bit --

00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:49.690
I mean I mention sort of theses
of identity and belonging

00:11:49.690 --> 00:11:53.050
and actually what stuck out to
me in the most recent book was,

00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:54.780
was that exchange between
Hopper and her mother

00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:56.190
about how to do Mandarin homework.

00:11:56.190 --> 00:11:58.220
That was so poetic.

00:11:58.220 --> 00:12:00.000
Like her mother has
this one approach.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.380
And she has a different one.

00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:02.680
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: That was --

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:04.170
so I do have I do have a scene

00:12:04.170 --> 00:12:06.750
in the second book
Hopper the main character,

00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:09.870
her mother is the Mandarin
teacher of her school.

00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:11.700
And part of Mandarin
homework is they have

00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:14.320
to write these characters over,
and over, and over again, right?

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:16.000
And that was actually
was actually a struggle

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.300
that I had when I was a kid.

00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:20.440
I went to Chinese school every
Saturday for 12 years of my life.

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:23.120 position:56%
I speak Chinese like a four year
old so it didn't really work for me.

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:24.420
But.

00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:25.720
[ Multiple Speakers ]

00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:27.020
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: We had to
write these characters over,

00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:28.320
and over, and over again.

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:29.620
And it really felt robotic.

00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:31.200
And it wasn't until I became
an adult that I realized

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:33.780
when you practice something
over, and over, and over again,

00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:35.700
you're not acting like a robot.

00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:39.900
You're actually gaining the skills
to express new ones, you know?

00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:42.780
And, and that's kind of what
I wanted in that exchange.

00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:44.080
&gt;&gt; Petra Mayer: Yeah it's true
if you're drawing something

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:45.690
in logo there's not a
whole lot of nuance.

00:12:45.690 --> 00:12:47.140
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Not
a lot of nuance yeah.

00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:48.440 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Petra Mayer: And less repetition.

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:49.740
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: It's just two
ways of approaching art, right?

00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:52.940
There's, there's one -- both
of them I think have a place.

00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:57.070
&gt;&gt; Petra Mayer: So we've discussed
education, and, and, and coding,

00:12:57.070 --> 00:12:58.750
and, and classroom subjects.

00:12:58.750 --> 00:13:01.370
And we've been mature and now
I want to talk about Superman.

00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:02.930
Superman is cool.

00:13:02.930 --> 00:13:04.940
I feel like we have to maybe
give people a little bit

00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:06.880
of a primer though on what's
going on right now in.

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:08.180
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yeah.

00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:09.480
&gt;&gt; Petra Mayer: See universe.

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:10.780
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang:
Because it's super heroes

00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:12.080
and super heroes are
always overly complicated.

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:13.580
&gt;&gt; Petra Mayer: Seriously, I
mean it took me so long to get

00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:15.770
into just Marvel continuity like I.

00:13:15.770 --> 00:13:17.070
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yeah.

00:13:17.070 --> 00:13:18.370
&gt;&gt; Petra Mayer: You know I,

00:13:18.370 --> 00:13:19.760
I sort of vaguely understand
the X-Men now but it's a task.

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:21.060
Let me tell you.

00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:22.360
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: I'm
not with you there.

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:23.660 position:56%
I don't understand the X-Men at all.

00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:24.960 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Petra Mayer: I like them vaguely.

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:26.260
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: I love
them but I don't understand.

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:27.560
&gt;&gt; Petra Mayer: I can
recommend you a pod cast.

00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:28.860
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Okay.

00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:30.160
&gt;&gt; Petra Mayer: After
this conversation.

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:31.460
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Awesome.

00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:32.760
&gt;&gt; Petra Mayer: So Gene is
writing the new Superman.

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:34.060
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yeah.

00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:35.360
&gt;&gt; Petra Mayer: Do you want to
explain why we need a new Superman.

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:37.150
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Because super
hero comics are super complicated.

00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:38.770
So this is what happened.

00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:43.120
In, in, in the DC universe this
past summer, Clark Kent died

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:44.780
and he was replaced
by three characters.

00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:47.300
Number one was another Clark
Kent from a different dimension.

00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:48.600
Like I said super heroes.

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:49.900
&gt;&gt; Petra Mayer: Didn't he
already die like once before?

00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:51.200
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yeah,
he died once before.

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:52.500
&gt;&gt; Petra Mayer: Okay.

00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:53.800
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: But that was
also in a different dimension.

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:55.100
Say -- anyways.

00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:56.400
He was replaced by Clark
Kent from another dimension.

00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:58.840
He was replaced by Lois
Lane who becomes Superwoman.

00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:02.270
And he's also replaced by a brand
new character Kenan Kong a 17 year

00:14:02.270 --> 00:14:03.840
old kid that grew up that --

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:07.540
is growing up in Shanghai who
gets some of Clark Kent's powers.

00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:10.620
And that's the, that's the
series that I'm working on.

00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:12.790
The third issue of new
Superman just came out about,

00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:14.090
about a week and a half ago.

00:14:14.090 --> 00:14:15.390
And this was not my idea.

00:14:15.390 --> 00:14:17.000
Actually I did not go to DC Comics

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.870
and go hey let's make
Superman Chinese.

00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:21.370
This is something that
they brought to me.

00:14:21.370 --> 00:14:24.170
And, and, and I remember when
they first brought this I was

00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:27.430
like that is a terrible idea.

00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:29.450
I don't want anything
to do with that.

00:14:29.450 --> 00:14:30.750
&gt;&gt; Petra Mayer: Why?

00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:32.050
I didn't -- well.

00:14:32.050 --> 00:14:33.350
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Oh my gosh.

00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:35.330
Okay so it's the idea -- from what
I gather it was the idea of Jim Lee

00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:37.960
who is the co-publisher
at DC Comics.

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:39.850
He was a fan favorite
artist in the 90's.

00:14:39.850 --> 00:14:41.150
He made a name for himself working.

00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:42.450
&gt;&gt; Petra Mayer: Sure.

00:14:42.450 --> 00:14:43.750
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: on X-Men.

00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:45.050
I collected Jim Lee comics
when I was in high school.

00:14:45.050 --> 00:14:46.350
&gt;&gt; Petra Mayer: Did
he found Wildstorm?

00:14:46.350 --> 00:14:47.650
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: I loved him.

00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:48.950
Yes and he also found
-- founded Wildstorm.

00:14:48.950 --> 00:14:50.250
And then it was also Geoff Johns.

00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:51.550
Geoff Johns a super star
-- super hero writer.

00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:53.060 position:56%
He's the president of DC Comics now.

00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:57.690 position:56%
Supposedly they both wanted an
Asian member of the Superman family.

00:14:57.690 --> 00:15:03.740
You know? But I did not want to
do that because I just immediately

00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:07.230
when I heard that idea I was like
there are so many land mines there.

00:15:07.230 --> 00:15:08.790
You know both culturally
and politically.

00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:11.790
So first of all my
parents had a very,

00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:15.790
very like specific
political views about China.

00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:17.450
My dad grew up in Taiwan.

00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:19.650
My mom left main land China just

00:15:19.650 --> 00:15:22.400
as the communist government
was coming to power.

00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:24.130
So they have very specific views.

00:15:24.130 --> 00:15:26.320
And Superman was supposed
to be about truth,

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:28.310
justice and the American way.

00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:31.380
So what does that mean to have a
character representing those three

00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:33.240
things in China?

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:35.040
In modern China, in
modern China right?

00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:37.410
And I just was like man that's --

00:15:37.410 --> 00:15:38.900
I'm going to get so much
hate mail if I do that.

00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:40.550
I do not want to do it.

00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:44.520
And then I get called then
to DC Comics Burbank offices.

00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:48.700
I have this hour long
meeting with Jim Lee.

00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:50.030
I'm a huge Jim Lee fan.

00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:51.360
Boy, like I said I
grew up on his comics.

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:52.660
I don't even remember what he said.

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:54.050
I just stared at his
face for like an hour.

00:15:54.050 --> 00:15:55.350
&gt;&gt; Petra Mayer: I know
I met him too.

00:15:55.350 --> 00:15:56.650
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: And at the end.

00:15:56.650 --> 00:15:57.950
&gt;&gt; Petra Mayer: And I was like.

00:15:57.950 --> 00:15:59.250
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yeah.

00:15:59.250 --> 00:16:00.550
&gt;&gt; Petra Mayer: No.

00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:01.850
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang:
Exactly like that.

00:16:01.850 --> 00:16:03.150
With the finger to my lips.

00:16:03.150 --> 00:16:04.450
And then at the end I'm
like okay let's do it.

00:16:04.450 --> 00:16:05.750
&gt;&gt; Petra Mayer: It's true --

00:16:05.750 --> 00:16:07.050
now that I, I mean I read the
first three issues and it's true,

00:16:07.050 --> 00:16:09.390
there's no equivalent so
far in the comics of truth,

00:16:09.390 --> 00:16:11.120
justice and the American way.

00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:12.420
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yeah like.

00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:13.720
&gt;&gt; Petra Mayer: Not really.

00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:15.020
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: What we --

00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:16.320
so, so one of the things that you
know I teach at Hamlin University.

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:17.930
I teach creative writing
to mostly adult students.

00:16:17.930 --> 00:16:20.270
And one of the things I tell my
students is whatever you're scared

00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:22.810
of as a writer just run
at it as hard as you can.

00:16:22.810 --> 00:16:27.570 position:56%
So because that was what scared me
about this Chinese Superman project,

00:16:27.570 --> 00:16:30.020
I just decided to run at
it as hard as I could.

00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:34.160 position:56%
So in the first story arc which
takes place in the first six issues,

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:37.080
the bad guys are the Freedom
Fighters of China were fighting

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:39.730
for truth, justice and democracy.

00:16:39.730 --> 00:16:42.370
So it's about how the
new Superman reacts

00:16:42.370 --> 00:16:44.590
to these supposed super villains.

00:16:44.590 --> 00:16:47.160 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Petra Mayer: I still have to say,
not to put too fine a point upon it,

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:49.300
cannot -- Kenan Kong is a jerk.

00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:50.600
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yeah.

00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:51.960
Kenan Kong is a major jerk.

00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:53.260
He's, he's a .

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:54.560 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Petra Mayer: He's not Clark Kent.

00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:55.860
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: No
he's not Clark Kent.

00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:57.160
&gt;&gt; Petra Mayer: He's
not mild mannered.

00:16:57.160 --> 00:16:58.460
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yeah, he,
he starts off as a bully.

00:16:58.460 --> 00:17:00.460 position:56%
And the inspiration behind that is
actually from two different sources.

00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:02.680
One is American.

00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:05.290
Most of you probably have
not read Superman's stories

00:17:05.290 --> 00:17:06.910
from the 1930's and 40's.

00:17:06.910 --> 00:17:09.800
But Clark Kent started
off as a jerk wad.

00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:11.370
He was a major, major jerk.

00:17:11.370 --> 00:17:13.630
In the 30's and 40's he
would beat people up and then

00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:17.290
after he was done beating them up
hew would like sermonize at them.

00:17:17.290 --> 00:17:18.590
He would do really cruel things.

00:17:18.590 --> 00:17:19.890
He would take these slum
lords and leave them

00:17:19.890 --> 00:17:21.350
on a desert island
to starve to death.

00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:22.700
And he would never
come back for them.

00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:24.000
He would just let, let that happen.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.130
&gt;&gt; Petra Mayer: I think there's
actually a tumbler called superman

00:17:26.130 --> 00:17:27.430
is a jerk.

00:17:27.430 --> 00:17:28.730
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yeah.

00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:30.030
&gt;&gt; Petra Mayer: Or
something like that.

00:17:30.030 --> 00:17:31.330
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Exactly.

00:17:31.330 --> 00:17:32.630
&gt;&gt; Petra Mayer: Yeah.

00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:33.930
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: And
it's all from like.

00:17:33.930 --> 00:17:35.230
&gt;&gt; Petra Mayer: Yeah.

00:17:35.230 --> 00:17:36.530
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang:
the 30's and 40's.

00:17:36.530 --> 00:17:37.830
&gt;&gt; Petra Mayer: Golden
age Superman where.

00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:39.130
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yeah.

00:17:39.130 --> 00:17:40.430
&gt;&gt; Petra Mayer: He's
being a complete jerk.

00:17:40.430 --> 00:17:41.730
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: So, so Clark
Kent himself actually went

00:17:41.730 --> 00:17:43.030
through this moral development,
as the, as the decades went on.

00:17:43.030 --> 00:17:44.330
We wanted, we wanted
the Chinese Superman

00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:45.630
to have the same moral development.

00:17:45.630 --> 00:17:46.930
The second thing is I'm
hugely influenced by the story

00:17:46.930 --> 00:17:48.230
of the Monkey King, which
is Journey to the West.

00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:49.530
It's a.

00:17:49.530 --> 00:17:50.830
&gt;&gt; Petra Mayer: Right.

00:17:50.830 --> 00:17:52.130
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Classic.

00:17:52.130 --> 00:17:53.430
&gt;&gt; Petra Mayer: Plays a large part
in American Born Chinese, which.

00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:54.730
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: It does.

00:17:54.730 --> 00:17:56.030
&gt;&gt; Petra Mayer: I think
is fantastic.

00:17:56.030 --> 00:17:57.330
You guys should all read it.

00:17:57.330 --> 00:17:58.630
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: The
Monkey King also starts off

00:17:58.630 --> 00:17:59.930
as this major jerk off.

00:17:59.930 --> 00:18:01.230
What, what Journey to the West is

00:18:01.230 --> 00:18:02.530
about is the Monkey King's
spiritual journey going

00:18:02.530 --> 00:18:03.830
from selfishness to selflessness.

00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:05.130
So Kenan is going to
make that same journey.

00:18:05.130 --> 00:18:06.430
&gt;&gt; Petra Mayer: I also
was interested in --

00:18:06.430 --> 00:18:07.730
I read an interview where you
talked about picking his name.

00:18:07.730 --> 00:18:09.030
Which puts [inaudible].

00:18:09.030 --> 00:18:10.330
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Oh my gosh.

00:18:10.330 --> 00:18:11.630
&gt;&gt; Petra Mayer: You guys
probably know that people

00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:12.930
in the Superman universe have
alliterative names like Lex Luthor,

00:18:12.930 --> 00:18:14.230
Leven Lang etcetera, etcetera.

00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:15.530
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yeah.

00:18:15.530 --> 00:18:16.830
You know Chinese names
are super hard.

00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:18.130
It's like ridiculously hard.

00:18:18.130 --> 00:18:20.960
I, I have an acquaintance who is
a Mandarin high school teacher.

00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:22.550
And she was like it takes
me three weeks to come

00:18:22.550 --> 00:18:24.550
up with my students
names it's so hard.

00:18:24.550 --> 00:18:27.360
Because there're aren't like
defaults you can go to right?

00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:29.580
And in the original -- so
this is the controversy.

00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:31.330
The original name -- like
this is what I wanted.

00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:34.220
I wanted something that
started with the K sound to, to,

00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:35.910
to kind of mirror Clark Kent.

00:18:35.910 --> 00:18:40.450 position:56%
Two is I wanted it to be immediately
pronounceable by an American reader.

00:18:40.450 --> 00:18:42.700
And a, and just having

00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:45.990
that combination was
incredibly, incredibly difficult.

00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:48.710
I don't, I don't even think we
got it right because Kenan is

00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:51.800
like most people would
pronounce it Keenan in America.

00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:54.130
But at least it's pronounceable
enough.

00:18:54.130 --> 00:18:56.310
&gt;&gt; Petra Mayer: What do the
syllables actually mean?

00:18:56.310 --> 00:18:57.610
I know they actually
have some kind of.

00:18:57.610 --> 00:18:58.910
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yeah,
they, they have meaning.

00:18:58.910 --> 00:19:04.240
So, so Kong they're actually
only two common Chinese surnames

00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:05.690
that start with the K sound.

00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:07.740
It's Kang and Kong.

00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:10.640
Kang is a bad guy in the Marvel
universe so we went with Kong.

00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:14.580
And then the second one the,
the Kenan part it's two words.

00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:18.730 position:56%
The first one means to overcome,
which I we felt like was appropriate

00:19:18.730 --> 00:19:20.030
for a Superman character.

00:19:20.030 --> 00:19:22.180
And the second nan means south.

00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:24.260
And he's from Shanghai.

00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:29.000
People in Beijing call people
from Shanghai southerners.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:30.590
&gt;&gt; Petra Mayer: I'm a word
building junky so that kind

00:19:30.590 --> 00:19:32.560
of detail like so exciting to me.

00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:35.990
This is not the first super
hero comic you've done.

00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:37.410
There was the Shadow Hero.

00:19:37.410 --> 00:19:38.710
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yeah.

00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:40.010
&gt;&gt; Petra Mayer: Which
is sort of -- there --

00:19:40.010 --> 00:19:41.380
sort of an origin story right?

00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:44.910
For a, for a forgotten
silver age super hero.

00:19:44.910 --> 00:19:46.210
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yeah.

00:19:46.210 --> 00:19:47.510
Yeah Golden Age actually.

00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:48.810
&gt;&gt; Petra Mayer: Golden Age ooh.

00:19:48.810 --> 00:19:50.110 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Golden Age -- so.

00:19:50.110 --> 00:19:51.410
[ Multiple Speakers ]

00:19:51.410 --> 00:19:52.710
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: I, I learned
from the internet as you do

00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:54.010
with these sorts of things.

00:19:54.010 --> 00:19:57.360
But, but in the 1940's there
was a character by the name

00:19:57.360 --> 00:20:01.060
of The Green Turtle
and he is not awesome.

00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:05.900
He has a terrible suit like he has
a cowl and a cape and no shirt.

00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:07.280
That's what he looks like okay?

00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:09.210
And he's kind of a, a
Batman knock off as well.

00:20:09.210 --> 00:20:11.070
He operates out of a turtle cave.

00:20:11.070 --> 00:20:13.960
He drives a turtle plane.

00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:16.500
But there is one fascinating
thing about him and that is

00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:19.720
that the rumor is he might be the
first Chinese-American Superhero.

00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:22.570
His creator was a guy
named Chu Hing who was one

00:20:22.570 --> 00:20:23.870
of the first Asian-American

00:20:23.870 --> 00:20:25.970
to be working the American
comic book industry.

00:20:25.970 --> 00:20:29.370 position:56%
And the rumor about The Green Turtle
is that Chu wanted his character

00:20:29.370 --> 00:20:31.700
to be Chinese-American
like he himself was,

00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:33.000
but his publishers
wouldn't let him do it.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.300
Because they didn't think

00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:36.070
that a Chinese-American
superhero would sell

00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:37.720
in the American marketplace.

00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:41.900
So Chu Hing being a cartoonist
gets super passive aggressive

00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:43.200
and that's what we do.

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:44.500
That's what cartoonists do.

00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:47.750
And he draws these early
Green Turtle comics

00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:49.920
that you almost never see his face.

00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:51.620
He hides his face in shadow.

00:20:51.620 --> 00:20:53.780
He puts like furniture
in front of his face.

00:20:53.780 --> 00:20:55.910
He puts other characters
in front of his face.

00:20:55.910 --> 00:20:58.480
Every -- most of the time
you only see his back right?

00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:01.830
And, and the humor is
that he did that so he

00:21:01.830 --> 00:21:05.820
and his reader could imagine his,
his hero as a Chinese-American.

00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:07.910
Chu Hing never gets around to
telling us the original story

00:21:07.910 --> 00:21:10.100
and I thought man this
is like a whole

00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:12.260
in the American comic's
history that I want to fill.

00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:15.410
So I teamed up with a guy named
Sunny Lu amazingly talented

00:21:15.410 --> 00:21:18.220
cartoonist and together
we created a origin story

00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:20.460
for this obscure character
from the 1940's

00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:23.630
and firmly established
him as a Chinese-American.

00:21:23.630 --> 00:21:25.030
&gt;&gt; Petra Mayer: That's
almost like Fanfic.

00:21:25.030 --> 00:21:26.330
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang:
It totally is Fanfic.

00:21:26.330 --> 00:21:27.630
&gt;&gt; Petra Mayer: Did
you write Fanfic?

00:21:27.630 --> 00:21:28.930
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: We
were able to do it.

00:21:28.930 --> 00:21:30.230
We were able to do it
because he's in public domain.

00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:31.700
&gt;&gt; Petra Mayer: He is not Fanfic

00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:33.240
if you know you have
a platform like that.

00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:34.620
But I sort of sort of secretly.

00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:35.920
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: It is Fanfick.

00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:37.220
&gt;&gt; Petra Mayer: That's
my head cabin.

00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:38.520
Okay cool.

00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:39.820
So the nice lady there is telling
me we have 10 minutes left.

00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:41.120
So I'm just going to ask you
before we throw to the audience

00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:42.420
for questions, what's next?

00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:44.510
I know there's another volume
of Secret Coders in the works.

00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:46.300
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: So right
now I'm working on four,

00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:47.600
four projects, Secret Coders.

00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:49.180
I'm working on the continuation

00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:51.470
of Abcar Lesterbender
in graphic novel format.

00:21:51.470 --> 00:21:52.770
I'm working on the new Superman.

00:21:52.770 --> 00:21:55.040
And the next big project where
I'm doing both the writing

00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:57.020
and the drawing is
called Dragon Hoops.

00:21:57.020 --> 00:21:58.990
It is my first nonfiction work.

00:21:58.990 --> 00:22:02.330
I followed a high school basketball
team out of Oakland for a season

00:22:02.330 --> 00:22:05.800
for the 2014 2015 season
and it will be about that.

00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:07.400
&gt;&gt; Petra Mayer: Ah
that sounds so cool.

00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:10.250
And what are your plans for the
rest of your term as the ambassador

00:22:10.250 --> 00:22:11.550
for Young Peoples Literature?

00:22:11.550 --> 00:22:12.850
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang:
Well we are ramping

00:22:12.850 --> 00:22:14.150
up to do something for the summer.

00:22:14.150 --> 00:22:17.840 position:56%
We really want to a, a, put together
a, a, really full summer program.

00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:20.630
We're trying to figure out how
to get the word out about that.

00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:21.930
&gt;&gt; Petra Mayer: Cool.

00:22:21.930 --> 00:22:23.230
Well thank you so much.

00:22:23.230 --> 00:22:24.530
I think it might be time --

00:22:24.530 --> 00:22:25.830
do people in the audience
have questions?

00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:27.920
Is that a -- do we have
people with microphones?

00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:29.950
Here we go.

00:22:29.950 --> 00:22:31.250
Hey there's somebody.

00:22:31.250 --> 00:22:32.550
&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:22:32.550 --> 00:22:33.850
&gt;&gt; Petra Mayer: The
lights are so bright.

00:22:33.850 --> 00:22:36.060
&gt;&gt; Hi. This is a very
strange question.

00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:41.680
I was analyzing Boxers and Saints
for one of my college classes

00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:42.980
on the graphic novel actually.

00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:44.280
And I kind of.

00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:45.580
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang:
That's kind of awesome.

00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:46.880
&gt;&gt; Okay. It kind of was.

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:48.650
And I was kind of really
happy when I saw it

00:22:48.650 --> 00:22:51.110
in the syllabus because I'm weird.

00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:52.410
I'm rambling.

00:22:52.410 --> 00:22:53.710
But so I came up with a theory

00:22:53.710 --> 00:23:00.240
about why Saints was very dully
colored except for the visions.

00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:01.540
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Okay awesome.

00:23:01.540 --> 00:23:04.540
&gt;&gt; I'm curious if I came
up with the right reason.

00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:06.640
So why did you do that?

00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:07.940
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: I
thought you were going

00:23:07.940 --> 00:23:11.180
to tell me your reason first.

00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:12.550
&gt;&gt; My theory was because Joan

00:23:12.550 --> 00:23:15.960
of Arc's visions were
supposedly in gold.

00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:17.260
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Wow .

00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:18.560
Okay that's kind of,
that's kind of it.

00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:19.860
That's kind of it.

00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:21.160
That awesome.

00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:22.460
First of all thank you for doing
homework about one of my comics.

00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:23.760
I really appreciate that.

00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:25.300
Boxers and Saints is a
two volume graphic novel

00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:27.430
about the Boxer Rebellion,
the good guys on one side

00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:28.730
and bad guys on the other.

00:23:28.730 --> 00:23:32.380
The first volume Boxers I
wanted to be about heroism.

00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:34.420
So I looked at heroic
storytelling traditions,

00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:37.140
like American Super Hero
comics and like Chinese opera.

00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:39.490
So it's brightly colored
it's really long.

00:23:39.490 --> 00:23:40.790
It's really sad.

00:23:40.790 --> 00:23:42.320
Kind of the way Chinese opera is.

00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:44.930
And then the second
volume I wanted it to be

00:23:44.930 --> 00:23:46.860
about sainthood, saintliness.

00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:49.230
And, and, and regardless of
what faith or tradition you come

00:23:49.230 --> 00:23:52.250
from whether it's eastern or
western saintliness is always tied

00:23:52.250 --> 00:23:53.550
in with humility.

00:23:53.550 --> 00:23:55.960
So I wanted that book to seem much
more humble than the first one.

00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:57.260
That's why it's shorter.

00:23:57.260 --> 00:23:58.560
That's why it's dully colored.

00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:00.960
I actually was fighting
for my publisher

00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:03.080
to print it on like cheaper paper.

00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:05.510
But they would not let me do that
which is probably a good idea.

00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:08.220
Which is probably a good idea but
that, that, that was the thinking.

00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:11.990
But, but what, what you were
noticing was actually the Joan

00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:16.500
of Arc sequences we wanted to
model after illuminated manuscripts

00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:18.690
from like you know
old school Europe.

00:24:18.690 --> 00:24:20.270
And that's what, that's
what you were seeing right?

00:24:20.270 --> 00:24:21.570
So.

00:24:21.570 --> 00:24:22.870
&gt;&gt; Petra Mayer: Ah.

00:24:22.870 --> 00:24:24.170
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: It looks much
more like illuminated manuscript

00:24:24.170 --> 00:24:25.470
if it's set against a dull tone.

00:24:25.470 --> 00:24:27.390
&gt;&gt; Petra Mayer: I think we have
time for two more questions.

00:24:27.390 --> 00:24:30.160
So step up.

00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:32.860
&gt;&gt; So how does American
Born Chinese relate

00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:36.360
to like your experiences
and if it does like.

00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:37.950
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Well
first thank you for --

00:24:37.950 --> 00:24:39.700
I'm assuming you read
American War Chinese.

00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:41.000
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:42.300
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Thank
you for reading it.

00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:43.600
American Born Chinese
is a work of fiction

00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:46.130
but I definitely pulled really
heavily from my own life to,

00:24:46.130 --> 00:24:49.560
to write that book especially the
middle story line about Jin Wang,

00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:50.960
that Chinese American
kid who's growing

00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:52.960
up in a predominately
white neighborhood.

00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:56.340
I pulled heavily from my
late elementary school years

00:24:56.340 --> 00:24:58.020
and my, and my junior high.

00:24:58.020 --> 00:24:59.320
Especially junior high.

00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:03.200 position:56%
Junior high was when I experiment--
experienced the most explicit racism

00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:07.280
because people in junior high
including me are jerks, right?

00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:09.670
Anybody who has gone through
junior high you know that.

00:25:09.670 --> 00:25:10.970
But thank you.

00:25:10.970 --> 00:25:12.270
Thank you for your question.

00:25:12.270 --> 00:25:13.570
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:25:13.570 --> 00:25:14.870
&gt;&gt; I'll be quick, it's
not a question.

00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:16.170
It's a compliment.

00:25:16.170 --> 00:25:17.470
I'm a middle school
language arts teacher

00:25:17.470 --> 00:25:19.110
and over the years I've built a
pretty extensive personal classroom

00:25:19.110 --> 00:25:20.800
library for my students.

00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:24.660
And Boxers and Saints is
the most stolen text out of.

00:25:24.660 --> 00:25:25.960
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: That is.

00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:27.260
&gt;&gt; Petra Mayer: That's
a great accolade.

00:25:27.260 --> 00:25:28.560
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Thank you.

00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:29.860
Thank you so much.

00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:32.190
&gt;&gt; Petra Mayer: Ah can we
take one more question.

00:25:32.190 --> 00:25:33.490
No we're done?

00:25:33.490 --> 00:25:34.790
Oh one more.

00:25:34.790 --> 00:25:36.090
Okay.

00:25:36.090 --> 00:25:41.000 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Hello. First of all I want to say
I've read all you books and Boxers

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.470
and Saints is probably my
favorite graphic novel of all time.

00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:45.870
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang:
Oh wow, thank you.

00:25:45.870 --> 00:25:47.170
Thank you.

00:25:47.170 --> 00:25:48.470
That's really gratifying to hear.

00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:50.480
Because that took six like eight
six years of my life that book.

00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:51.780
But thank you.

00:25:51.780 --> 00:25:53.080
Thank you so much.

00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:58.460
&gt;&gt; I wanted to know what
made you decide to take the,

00:25:58.460 --> 00:26:03.360
to take the Boxer Rebellion and
create it into a graphic novel?

00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:04.660
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Well I, I,
I didn't really know that much

00:26:04.660 --> 00:26:06.600
about the Boxer Rebellion
when I started that project.

00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:09.760
I grew up in a Chinese-American
Catholic community.

00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:15.210
And in the year 2000 Pope
John Paul II canonized a group

00:26:15.210 --> 00:26:16.510
of Chinese catholic saints.

00:26:16.510 --> 00:26:19.330
So from my home church this
was like a big, big deal.

00:26:19.330 --> 00:26:20.860
They like freaked out about it.

00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:24.550
They had all sorts of special
masses and celebrations,

00:26:24.550 --> 00:26:25.860
there were like egg
rolls everywhere.

00:26:25.860 --> 00:26:29.130
Anytime you see like
giant trays of egg rolls

00:26:29.130 --> 00:26:33.010
around Chinese people they're
really happy about something.

00:26:33.010 --> 00:26:38.100
And, and, and I, I was inspired
by these, these festivities.

00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:41.740
I looked in the lives of these
canonized saints and discovered

00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:44.140
that they were mostly a lot

00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:45.660
of them were martyred
during the Boxer Rebellion.

00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:48.410
And they were martyred specifically
back then if you were Chinese

00:26:48.410 --> 00:26:51.420
and you were -- you like embraced
any sort of western faith,

00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:54.360
you were seen as somebody who
turned her back on her culture.

00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:56.530
So the more I read about the
Boxer Rebellion the more I felt

00:26:56.530 --> 00:27:00.020
like it mirrored this tension that
I had felt between the two halves

00:27:00.020 --> 00:27:01.660
of myself as an Asian-American.

00:27:01.660 --> 00:27:03.730
Between these eastern
and western halves.

00:27:03.730 --> 00:27:06.510
So I really went in I mean it
was it was a little bit selfish.

00:27:06.510 --> 00:27:08.300
It was a little bit like
looking in the mirror.

00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:12.420
I really went in wanting to
understand the tension in myself.

00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:14.200
&gt;&gt; Okay. Okay, thank you.

00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:15.500
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: But thank you.

00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:16.800
Thank you for that question.

00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:18.100
&gt;&gt; Petra Mayer: Alright.

00:27:18.100 --> 00:27:19.400
Thank you.

00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:20.700
Oh we can take two more?

00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:22.000
Okay we can take two more.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:23.300
Yay.

00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:24.600
&gt;&gt; Hello.

00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:25.900
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Hi.

00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:27.200
&gt;&gt; I read American Born Chinese in
college part of my identity class.

00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:31.610
Do you have any advice for
Asian-American people on how

00:27:31.610 --> 00:27:36.690
to write, sort of writing things
that everybody would like and also

00:27:36.690 --> 00:27:40.200
about Asian comments and culture?

00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:41.720
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Okay
you're asking advice

00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:43.400
for Asian-American writers.

00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:45.270
Are you an Asian-American writer?

00:27:45.270 --> 00:27:46.570
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:27:46.570 --> 00:27:47.870
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Awesome.

00:27:47.870 --> 00:27:49.200
Awesome. Well, well first as a --

00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:52.490
just for writers in general I
think one of the things you have

00:27:52.490 --> 00:27:55.980 position:56%
to realize is your self doubt and
fear is just never going to go away.

00:27:55.980 --> 00:27:58.760
You know it will always be there
no matter, no matter what you do.

00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:01.200
So you just have to
hug it like a friend.

00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:04.360
You know? And, and just
recognize it will always be there.

00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:06.260
As an Asian-American I would say

00:28:06.260 --> 00:28:11.190
in general there's this really
weird thing that happens

00:28:11.190 --> 00:28:14.450
where is you give deep
into your own experience.

00:28:14.450 --> 00:28:18.380
If you get specific it
suddenly becomes universal.

00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:19.680
You know what I mean?

00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:20.980
It's like a, it's like
this really weird thing.

00:28:20.980 --> 00:28:23.740
The more specific you get the
more details, you, you lend,

00:28:23.740 --> 00:28:26.220
the more authentic your
experience becomes.

00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:29.490
And the more universal
appeal it has.

00:28:29.490 --> 00:28:32.310
So get over, get over the fear.

00:28:32.310 --> 00:28:34.690
And then go deep and specific.

00:28:34.690 --> 00:28:36.170
That would be my advice.

00:28:36.170 --> 00:28:37.970
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:28:37.970 --> 00:28:44.780
&gt;&gt; So I wanted to ask
whether the Sun Wokong part

00:28:44.780 --> 00:28:49.350
of American Born Chinese
actually follows the story line

00:28:49.350 --> 00:28:50.920
of Journey to the West?

00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:53.700
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: The -- okay
the Sun Wukong part of Journey

00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:57.260
to the West or of American
Born Chinese deviates.

00:28:57.260 --> 00:28:58.560
&gt;&gt; Oh.

00:28:58.560 --> 00:28:59.860
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: It deviates.

00:28:59.860 --> 00:29:02.700
I really hope that American Born
Chinese is not your only exposure

00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:05.540
to Journey to the West because that
book is mind blowing and amazing.

00:29:05.540 --> 00:29:07.940
There's a reason why you know
Chinese people have been reading

00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:10.200
that book for 500 years.

00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:14.200 position:56%
When I first started doing comics
as an adult I wanted to do some kind

00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:16.100
of adaption of the
Monkey King stories simply

00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:19.160
because I have a deep, deep
childhood attachment to it.

00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:21.810
And originally I was going
to do a straight adaptation,

00:29:21.810 --> 00:29:24.580
but then I realized almost
every working cartoonist

00:29:24.580 --> 00:29:27.220
in China had done a straight
adaptation and they're all better

00:29:27.220 --> 00:29:28.540
than anything I could do.

00:29:28.540 --> 00:29:30.780
So I set aside that idea and
eventually the way I came back

00:29:30.780 --> 00:29:34.420
to it I realized I'm going to use
the Monkey King story as a way

00:29:34.420 --> 00:29:36.730
of talking about the
Chinese-American experience.

00:29:36.730 --> 00:29:39.590
Because none of those Chinese
artists could do that, right?

00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:41.020
And that's why I deviated.

00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:43.430
I deviated in ways that
I felt like would bring

00:29:43.430 --> 00:29:47.540
in you know American
aspects to the story.

00:29:47.540 --> 00:29:48.840
&gt;&gt; Alright, thank you.

00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:50.140
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Thank you.

00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:51.440
&gt;&gt; Petra Mayer: And thank
you everyone for coming out

00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:53.300

really thoughtful questions.
