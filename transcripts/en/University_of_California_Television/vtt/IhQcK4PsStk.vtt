00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:03.260
- [Announcer] This
program is a presentation

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:07.463
of UCTV for educational
and noncommercial use only.

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:14.227
(electronic synthesizer music)

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:43.930
- Well, good afternoon.

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.940
I'm William Lester, professor of chemistry

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.250
and chair of the Hitchcock
Professorship Committee.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.640
We're pleased along with
the Graduate Council

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.920
to present Professor Sidney
Altman, this year's speaker

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.580
at the Charles M. and Martha
Hitchcock Lecture Series.

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.210
As a condition of this bequest,

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.020
we're obligated and happy

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.713
to tell you how the endowment
came to UC Berkeley.

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.560
It's a story that
exemplifies the many ways

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.450
this campus is linked to
the history of California

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.893
and the Bay Area.

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.120
Dr. Charles Hitchcock, a
physician for the Army,

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.070
came to San Francisco
during the Gold Rush,

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.920
where he opened a
thriving private practice.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.900
In 1885, Charles
established a professorship

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.170
here at Berkeley as an expression
of his long-held interest

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.890
in education.

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.320
His daughter, Lillie Hitchcock Coit,

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.173
still treasured in San Francisco.

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.960
For a colorful personality as
well as her large generosity,

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.930
greatly expanded her
father's original gift

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.830
to establish a professorship
at UC Berkeley,

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.933
making it possible for us to
present a series of lectures.

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.410
The Hitchcock Fund has become
one of the most cherished

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:58.210
endowments at the
University of California,

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.580
recognizing the highest distinction

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.763
of scholarly thought and achievement.

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:05.060
Thank you Lillie and Charles,

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.210
and now a few words
about Professor Altman.

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.220
Sidney Altman is internationally renowned

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.760
for his important contributions

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.763
to the fields of biochemistry
and molecular biology.

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.080
He and Thomas Cech share the
1989 Nobel Prize in chemistry

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.320
for their independent studies

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.313
demonstrating the
catalytic ability of RNA.

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.762
Altman discovered RNase P
and the enzymatic properties

00:02:30.762 --> 00:02:34.220
of the RNA subunit of that enzyme.

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.340
He found that RNA, which
was previously believed

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.720
to be simply a passive
carrier of genetic codes

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.010
between different parts of the cell,

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.520
could also initiate
and catalyze reactions.

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.390
This discovery refuted the
formerly unquestioned principle

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.310
that molecules could either
carry information like RNA

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.950
or catalyze chemical
reactions like proteins,

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:59.980
but they could not do both.

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.370
I apologize for the music.

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.430
Altman's breakthrough opened
up many new fields of research

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.210
and biotechnology, especially
focused on RNA structure

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:10.083
and function.

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.020
Professor Altman has been a faculty member

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:15.490
at Yale University since 1971,

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:19.050
teaching both undergraduate
and graduate courses.

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:21.180
Also at Yale, he has served as a chair

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.510
of the department of biology, 1983 to '85,

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.170
and dean of Yale College, 1985 to '89,

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.940
and is currently the Sterling Professor

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.930
of Molecular, Cellular,
and Developmental Biology.

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.770
Since his Nobel Prize in 1989,

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:40.850
he has been awarded honorary degrees

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.590
from the University of
Montreal, New York University,

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.799
Connecticut College, McGill University,

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:50.200
University of Colorado,
University of British Columbia,

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.830
Dartmouth College, Lake Forest College,

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:55.903
Concordia University, and
the University of Toronto.

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.600
In recognition of his
illuminating research,

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:00.870
Altman has been named a fellow

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.810
by the University of Colorado,

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:05.980
the Damon Runyon Fund,
the Anna Fuller Fund,

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.210
the California Institute of Technology,

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:10.210
and Dartmouth College.

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:12.570
Altman currently serves on
the Committee on Human Rights

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:14.920
of the National Academy of Sciences.

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.560
He has been on the board of trustees

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:18.540
of the Dime Institute

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:21.230
for the History of Science and Technology.

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:22.940
He has received a Rosentee Award

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:26.310
for basic biomedical research,
and that was in 1989.

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:29.983
Innovators of Science Award, 1992,

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:36.170
the Novartis Drew Award in
biomedical research in 1999,

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:37.810
and is an Einstein professor

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:40.090
of the Chinese Academy of Sciences

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:41.620
as well as a visiting professor

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.790
at the University of Glasgow.

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:46.919
Please join me in welcoming
Professor Sidney Altman.

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:49.336
(applauding)

00:04:53.376 --> 00:04:54.870
- Thank you, Professor Lester,

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:58.003
for that very generous introduction.

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.570
I'm of course happy to
be here back in Berkeley,

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:06.070
especially on such a
beautiful day as this one.

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:10.650
I apologize for those of you
that have taken a few days,

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:13.000
a few hours out of the brilliant sunshine

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.283
to come and listen to me
in this dark and gloom.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.863
But maybe we can make it
interesting in some way.

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:24.753
I'm going to talk today
about entering the RNA world,

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:29.003
and before I talk today and tomorrow,

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:31.950
I want to start off by doing something

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:35.350
that people usually do at
the end of their lectures

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:36.940
these days.

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:40.050
It's not infrequent these days to see

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:42.220
a final slide at somebody's lecture

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:47.220
which has six or seven
different awards of money

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:49.970
awarded to a different person

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:53.570
and 30 or 40 people who participated

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:55.823
in the research that's been talked about.

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:02.393
I simply want to say that
my work over the years

00:06:02.393 --> 00:06:06.133
has been supported by your taxes.

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:11.163
The money comes from NIH
and at one point from NSF,

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:17.250
and it's very easy to
calculate with round numbers,

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:21.380
that each of you have
given a few pennies a year

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:24.223
in terms of your income
tax to my research,

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:29.280
so I thank all of you for
that, and I'm grateful for it,

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:31.130
and that's why I mention it now,

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:32.983
and I will mention it again tomorrow.

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:39.270
Now, really I should start this lecture

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:44.053
with some discussion
of the origin of life.

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:46.710
And I'm not talking about human life,

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:48.693
I'm talking about life, per say.

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:54.240
One can ask some questions that may have

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:59.240
or you might construe as
being of a philosophical bend

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:02.433
and you may ask for philosophical answers,

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:07.440
but if I'm asked or pressed
hard in that regard,

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:09.480
I will simply answer with a grunt

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:14.939
or more articulately with a yes or a no

00:07:14.939 --> 00:07:19.210
because I'm really not
interested in the philosophy

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:21.600
of what I'm going to talk about.

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:24.480
So one of the questions we can ask is,

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:26.033
why is there life?

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:31.460
And after we consider that briefly,

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:35.193
we can ask, where, when, and how?

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:40.770
And then another question we can ask is,

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:43.730
why do we do experiments on something

00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:48.730
that we can never really
answer in any unique way?

00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:52.130
We might get a general
answer of what happened

00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:54.370
four billion years ago,

00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:56.400
but it's unlikely that we'll get an answer

00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:59.013
that will exactly
duplicate what did happen.

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:06.560
And the question then is,
should we do experiments?

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:12.510
And what do we learn
from doing experiments?

00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:14.890
And my answer to that is,

00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:19.423
we do experiments in any case
because that is what we do.

00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:25.480
In our own nature, we are problem solvers.

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:27.010
And if there are questions around,

00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:29.500
no matter what they are
or what field they're in,

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:31.560
we'll try and solve that problem.

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:33.453
We'll try and answer the questions.

00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:40.860
Okay, so I don't think I can answer about

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:42.960
the question about why there is life.

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:43.793
It happened.

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:47.730
And my preference is to think it happened

00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:52.730
as a consequence of
initially inorganic events

00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:59.060
that took place in our world,
and we went from there.

00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:03.983
But then the question is, did
it take place in our world?

00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:10.220
Now there is a theory which
several people have advanced

00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:15.220
on this question partly
because they were stumped

00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:19.960
in terms of trying to think
of what happened in our world.

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:22.090
That theory, as some
of you might recognize,

00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:25.440
is called panspermia, and the idea is

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:30.440
that life or some very extremely
primitive example of life

00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:35.510
was brought to Earth by
meteors or meteorites

00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:37.480
as they fell to Earth

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:40.370
that passed through the
atmosphere of another planet

00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:42.453
on which life already existed,

00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:46.540
or they resulted from
impacts on another planet

00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:48.930
where life already existed,

00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:52.823
and a rock or several rocks
appeared on this planet.

00:09:56.890 --> 00:10:00.080
There isn't much point in
talking more than that.

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:02.610
If it did happen on another planet,

00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:05.950
whatever did happen perhaps duplicates

00:10:05.950 --> 00:10:09.183
what we might think about
what happened on our planet.

00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:16.250
Now, the first slide you see

00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:19.820
is an illustration taken
from an article from Science

00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:22.980
about maybe 15 years ago

00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:26.350
that was discussing the origin of life.

00:10:26.350 --> 00:10:30.510
And it's really rather straightforward,

00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:32.203
if you can understand it.

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:37.553
Here we have the formation of Earth.

00:10:37.553 --> 00:10:39.890
It's a red ball,

00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:43.450
red because supposedly there
was a lot of volcanic activity

00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:46.160
about four and half billion years ago.

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:48.570
And we must remember,

00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:51.763
that the universe started
about 11 billion years ago.

00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:54.823
So this a relative newcomer.

00:10:55.810 --> 00:10:57.480
And then we have a stable hydrosphere,

00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:01.200
which we'll get to again in a few minutes.

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:04.300
That is to say, stable composition,

00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:08.120
chemical composition of
the sky and the oceans,

00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:10.283
both of which are extremely important.

00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:14.270
4.2 billion years ago.

00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:17.630
And about that time, we
have prebiotic chemistry.

00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:18.580
And what does that mean?

00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:23.070
That simply means from
very basic hydrocarbons,

00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:27.750
some chemicals were formed
that could participate

00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:31.670
in the origin of life as we know it today.

00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:35.960
Let me just define life,
for an instance, as saying

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:39.530
that you have to information
stored in some way

00:11:39.530 --> 00:11:40.960
in a molecule,

00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:44.050
and it has to be transmitted accurately

00:11:44.050 --> 00:11:46.890
from that molecule to daughter molecules.

00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:50.093
The accurate transmission
is what is most important.

00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:55.340
Now these particular little
molecules indicated there

00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:57.987
are actually are molecules

00:11:57.987 --> 00:12:00.637
that are currently important in life,

00:12:00.637 --> 00:12:03.310
and we don't know whether
they were important

00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:04.750
say 4 billion years ago,

00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:07.050
and again, I'll get to that shortly.

00:12:07.050 --> 00:12:08.920
Then we have the pre-RNA world,

00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:11.690
and I'm not sure what this represents,

00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:14.430
but it seems to be a parent molecule

00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:17.300
giving rise to daughters,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:20.870
But I'm not clear exactly
what's going on here.

00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:23.710
And then we have an RNA world,

00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:27.940
and we'll talk about the
origin of that particular term,

00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:30.010
and it's not clear that there was indeed

00:12:30.010 --> 00:12:32.310
an RNA world initially,

00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:36.000
but probably at some point,
there was an RNA world.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.290
And then we have the
first DNA, protein life,

00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:41.290
and then diversification of life.

00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:44.550
And here we have a
diagram which is typical

00:12:44.550 --> 00:12:48.130
of people dealing with
evolutionary diagrams

00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:50.890
indicating various branches occurring

00:12:50.890 --> 00:12:53.293
from a stem organism back here.

00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:58.883
Okay, so there are some
very simple questions.

00:13:00.410 --> 00:13:02.250
Extremely simple, you will say,

00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:06.050
or maybe much too simple from
what I'm going to tell you

00:13:06.050 --> 00:13:10.130
that one has to ask about
these particular times,

00:13:10.130 --> 00:13:12.663
let's say 4 billion years ago or so.

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:18.630
And they are the nature
of the ocean and water,

00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:21.730
that is to say what is the
chemical nature of the oceans?

00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:24.010
How much water was there?

00:13:24.010 --> 00:13:26.050
The nature of the sky,

00:13:26.050 --> 00:13:31.050
how much oxygen or methane or
carbon dioxide was in the sky?

00:13:32.070 --> 00:13:35.570
The temperature of the sky and the oceans.

00:13:35.570 --> 00:13:38.093
Electrical discharge in the sky.

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:42.593
And the time it took for events
we're going to talk about.

00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:49.520
Now, this is important
because I think in 1951,

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:54.430
Miller and Yuri published a
paper in which they put some

00:13:54.430 --> 00:13:56.847
very simple hydrocarbons--

00:13:57.880 --> 00:13:59.410
A hydrocarbon is something made up

00:13:59.410 --> 00:14:04.313
of carbon, hydrogen,
and oxygen into a flask,

00:14:05.270 --> 00:14:08.070
and they irradiated that with UV light.

00:14:08.070 --> 00:14:10.773
UV light being the
equivalent of lightning,

00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:15.000
and that went on for a few hours,

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.390
and the experiment was over.

00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:19.230
They looked at what they saw,

00:14:19.230 --> 00:14:22.010
and they found a lot of brown gunk

00:14:22.010 --> 00:14:23.310
in the bottom of the tube.

00:14:24.410 --> 00:14:29.040
When that was analyzed, they
found many simple amino acids,

00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:32.490
and amino acids are the
basic elements of proteins.

00:14:32.490 --> 00:14:34.690
And so that experiment was regarded

00:14:34.690 --> 00:14:38.708
as a landmark in terms of indicating

00:14:38.708 --> 00:14:42.290
that that was all you needed to form life,

00:14:42.290 --> 00:14:45.760
because you could make
essentially amino acids

00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:48.070
and then proteins from that point.

00:14:48.070 --> 00:14:50.420
That was at a stage when
it was still thought that

00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:54.770
proteins were essential
for the evolution of life.

00:14:54.770 --> 00:14:58.670
We know, I think probably
definitely at this point,

00:14:58.670 --> 00:15:01.290
that that certainly was not true,

00:15:01.290 --> 00:15:03.603
that is to say that
proteins were necessary.

00:15:04.510 --> 00:15:08.630
And of course, initially the
sky was probably much more

00:15:10.308 --> 00:15:12.200
of a percentage of the
chemicals in the sky,

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:15.660
it contained much more
methane and carbon dioxide

00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:19.500
rather than oxygen as it does now,

00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:21.550
because you had all the emissions

00:15:21.550 --> 00:15:24.077
from volcanic eruptions over the years,

00:15:24.077 --> 00:15:27.180
and the ocean, too, was
let's say contaminated

00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:29.380
by such chemicals.

00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:33.420
Now if you read various periodicals

00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:36.040
as most of us do or most of
us who are scientists do,

00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:38.900
like Science and Nature,

00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:41.400
every few weeks or every few months,

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:45.032
you will see another paper calculating

00:15:45.032 --> 00:15:48.900
what the percentage of
oxygen of the oceans were

00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:51.670
or what percentage of various chemicals

00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:53.010
that were in the oceans

00:15:53.010 --> 00:15:56.310
and how much oxygen there was in the sky.

00:15:56.310 --> 00:16:00.370
Now these are not mindless calculations.

00:16:00.370 --> 00:16:02.276
They're based on the chemical nature

00:16:02.276 --> 00:16:05.590
of various rocks on the Earth

00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:09.550
and reasonable assumptions
about how they formed.

00:16:09.550 --> 00:16:14.500
So as you watch these
publications from year to year,

00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:18.993
you will find that these
experiments change somewhat.

00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:23.140
Perhaps that was one of the reasons why

00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:27.550
I was never extremely interested let's say

00:16:27.550 --> 00:16:29.493
in the quote, origin of life,

00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:32.450
because to me it seemed like something

00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:35.550
that we could only speculate about,

00:16:35.550 --> 00:16:38.340
and in fact, it struck
me that this is something

00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:41.820
that you could fruitfully
think about in the bathtub

00:16:42.694 --> 00:16:44.523
but perhaps nowhere else.

00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:50.770
Now this is another graph that illustrates

00:16:50.770 --> 00:16:52.980
some of the things that
I just talked about.

00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:56.710
This was taken from a paper
in Nature a few weeks ago

00:16:56.710 --> 00:16:58.600
from Donahue and Ancliff

00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:00.773
about the origins of certain fossils.

00:17:01.890 --> 00:17:05.410
But here on this axis, we have the time,

00:17:05.410 --> 00:17:07.410
billions of years ago.

00:17:07.410 --> 00:17:11.930
4 billions right here, and
we have the oceans here.

00:17:11.930 --> 00:17:14.170
They're anoxic up to this point,

00:17:14.170 --> 00:17:18.730
which means very little or no
oxygen at all in the oceans,

00:17:18.730 --> 00:17:20.560
and then they're sulphidic,

00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:23.060
which means they have
a lot of sulfate ions

00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:25.560
and other sulfur compounds in them.

00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:28.600
And then they're oxic at this point here.

00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:33.600
Now there seems to be
transition points here and here,

00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:37.290
but I will indicate
that that's conjecture.

00:17:37.290 --> 00:17:39.770
If there were changes, and
there probably were changes,

00:17:39.770 --> 00:17:43.183
they probably occurred over
a few hundred million years.

00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:46.270
And the same thing is true when we look

00:17:46.270 --> 00:17:48.340
at the atmosphere per say.

00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:50.970
There's supposedly a
great oxidation event here

00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:55.260
at about 2.5 billion years ago,

00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:58.000
and the percentage of oxygen went up,

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.840
stayed constant for
awhile, then went up again.

00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:04.483
Now on top of the graph, there
are various things indicated.

00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:08.630
Here we have expanse stromatolites.

00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:11.460
Now these are, we're
talking about fossils here.

00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:15.200
Stromatolites, if you see a
picture of them in a rock,

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:17.380
they look like spaghetti.

00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:20.580
It's not absolutely clear
that they were fossils,

00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:22.680
although many people think that they were.

00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:28.590
And in fact, they seem to
be given the indication

00:18:28.590 --> 00:18:33.020
that they were the first living
fossils that we could find.

00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:35.823
So that's about 3 and a
half billion years ago,

00:18:35.823 --> 00:18:40.410
but they already show
considerably existence

00:18:40.410 --> 00:18:41.910
of complex life.

00:18:41.910 --> 00:18:44.160
So life must have started perhaps

00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:47.020
500 million years before that.

00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:50.500
This paper that I used this figure from

00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:52.770
is about the Gabon fossils,

00:18:52.770 --> 00:18:55.060
which are supposedly
fossils which indicate

00:18:55.060 --> 00:18:57.500
the beginning of eukaryotic life,

00:18:57.500 --> 00:19:00.710
that is organisms with a nucleus.

00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:04.370
And here we have the oldest
certain bacteria fossils

00:19:04.370 --> 00:19:07.170
around this so that's about 2
and a half million years ago.

00:19:07.170 --> 00:19:09.980
And then we go up to
much more recent times.

00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:13.340
And of course humans or pre-human fossils

00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:15.803
would be just at the limit down here.

00:19:18.530 --> 00:19:23.530
Now there is one theory
that clays, mineral clays

00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:29.910
have something to do
with the origin of life.

00:19:29.910 --> 00:19:33.550
And the idea is that you can have clays

00:19:33.550 --> 00:19:37.890
which are of a particular
chemical composition in layers

00:19:37.890 --> 00:19:41.140
so that for example you
have a particular layer

00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:43.430
where the clay is laid down

00:19:44.330 --> 00:19:48.337
and all the direction of the clays

00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:55.270
are pointed in one particular axis here,

00:19:55.270 --> 00:19:57.690
and this might be another kind of clay

00:19:57.690 --> 00:20:00.410
also laid down in this direction,

00:20:00.410 --> 00:20:02.570
and these are others here.

00:20:02.570 --> 00:20:06.080
And the idea was that,
this is Graham Cairns-Smith

00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:08.400
is one of the principal authors here.

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:12.330
The idea was near the
surface of these clays,

00:20:12.330 --> 00:20:15.480
it's quite probable that
the chemical composition

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:19.210
of the medium was uniform and distinct

00:20:19.210 --> 00:20:22.180
from the rest of the surrounding medium,

00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:24.620
however you want to define that,

00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:28.530
and in fact, it is
suggested that if there were

00:20:28.530 --> 00:20:31.580
some molecules that were viable

00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:34.460
in terms of their utility for life,

00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:36.760
they could be laid down on these strata

00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:41.070
in a particular direction, and in fact,

00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:45.810
for example if you have
the D and L amino acids,

00:20:45.810 --> 00:20:50.130
for example is one idea,
where you have stereo-isomers

00:20:50.130 --> 00:20:51.870
of the amino acids,

00:20:51.870 --> 00:20:54.470
one of these layers you
might only have the L acids,

00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:56.190
on the other, the D acids.

00:20:56.190 --> 00:20:58.850
The same thing could be true with sugars.

00:20:58.850 --> 00:21:02.220
So this is a way of separating

00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:05.300
essential molecules that
were essential for life.

00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:07.900
There's no evidence that this is real.

00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:12.300
Although a lot of people,
especially some geologists,

00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:15.893
put some weight to this kind of theory.

00:21:19.370 --> 00:21:24.370
Now, 1967, Crick and Orgel

00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:29.510
and Woese wrote separate articles.

00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:30.770
Woese wrote a book,

00:21:30.770 --> 00:21:33.670
and J.D. Bernal, who was
towards the end of his life,

00:21:33.670 --> 00:21:36.210
wrote something in England,

00:21:36.210 --> 00:21:40.400
saying that it seemed possible

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:43.283
that RNA could be involved
at the beginning of life,

00:21:44.780 --> 00:21:47.150
but it was unclear to say that.

00:21:47.150 --> 00:21:49.730
And Crick, Orgel, and Woese said

00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:52.930
specifically in their papers that

00:21:52.930 --> 00:21:56.510
no enzymatic activity or
no any kind of activity

00:21:56.510 --> 00:21:58.020
could be associated with RNA,

00:21:58.020 --> 00:22:00.590
other than its informational content.

00:22:00.590 --> 00:22:04.480
So it's unlikely that
we have to consider RNA

00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:06.163
for this event at all.

00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:09.960
There was an idea,

00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:13.720
and I think Bernal was one of
the people that put it forward

00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:17.000
that RNA mostly live as a
single-stranded molecule,

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.110
I'll get to that in a second.

00:22:19.110 --> 00:22:23.850
That is there's a long
polymer by itself in solution,

00:22:23.850 --> 00:22:27.400
and it could fold up in
various ways in solution,

00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:31.130
and in fact, in the cell
what was known at that time,

00:22:31.130 --> 00:22:33.370
it was relatively easy to find it

00:22:33.370 --> 00:22:35.650
in various parts of a cell.

00:22:35.650 --> 00:22:38.800
However, DNA was a
double-stranded molecule

00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:43.800
which two strands are helically
intertwined about each other

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:48.210
and it was fairly inert
in terms of chemistry.

00:22:48.210 --> 00:22:50.650
It lived only in cell
nuclei, nowhere else.

00:22:50.650 --> 00:22:52.640
This is in eukaryotes.

00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:56.710
So DNA was unlikely to be
used if you needed something

00:22:56.710 --> 00:22:59.483
that could be an interesting molecule.

00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:04.280
That is, those are weak arguments

00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:09.550
for RNA possibly being
there at the origin of life,

00:23:09.550 --> 00:23:12.780
and Crick, Orgel, and Woese said

00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:14.890
no activity has been shown for RNA

00:23:14.890 --> 00:23:17.000
so we'll dispose of it for awhile.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:18.660
This is in '67.

00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:20.763
So let's talk about RNA for a second,

00:23:21.670 --> 00:23:24.800
and I'm sorry for you
professional molecular biologists

00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:25.940
in the audience.

00:23:25.940 --> 00:23:27.850
I'm not sorry for you personally.

00:23:27.850 --> 00:23:30.690
I feel very proud of you in these days

00:23:30.690 --> 00:23:33.883
when molecular biology
seems to be faltering along,

00:23:36.110 --> 00:23:37.880
but because you know all this,

00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:39.513
let me talk about this anyway.

00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:45.440
So we have here the
phosphate backbone of RNA.

00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:48.310
Phosphate connected to a sugar

00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:50.840
connected to another phosphate sugar.

00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:54.140
This the backbone of one strand of RNA.

00:23:54.140 --> 00:23:56.840
And connected to each sugar at this end,

00:23:56.840 --> 00:23:59.830
there is what is called a base,

00:23:59.830 --> 00:24:01.830
adenine, cytosine, guanine, and uracil

00:24:01.830 --> 00:24:04.290
in these particular cases.

00:24:04.290 --> 00:24:08.140
And the information value of RNA is found

00:24:08.140 --> 00:24:10.210
in the sequence of the bases

00:24:10.210 --> 00:24:13.970
because the bases themselves
can form complexes

00:24:13.970 --> 00:24:16.680
or hydrogen bonds with other bases

00:24:17.550 --> 00:24:21.940
and transmit information
in that particular way.

00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:26.940
So this is an important
basic lesson about RNA

00:24:27.557 --> 00:24:30.060
and what it's nature is at the moment.

00:24:30.060 --> 00:24:32.104
The next slide simply shows another

00:24:32.104 --> 00:24:34.273
detailed picture of RNA,

00:24:36.270 --> 00:24:38.720
of two particular subunits here,

00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:41.030
phosphate sugar, phosphate sugar

00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:42.990
and a couple of bases.

00:24:42.990 --> 00:24:47.340
And here we have various alternatives

00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:49.183
to the bases that you can make.

00:24:50.350 --> 00:24:53.050
Diaminopurine, hypoxanthine,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:24:53.050 --> 00:24:54.270
Various other bases here,

00:24:54.270 --> 00:24:55.860
which will all have the appropriate

00:24:55.860 --> 00:24:58.800
hydrogen bonding characteristics.

00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:01.040
You can have different sugars,

00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:03.340
different phosphate linkages.

00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:08.233
In fact, people who do experiments,

00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:10.720
supposedly on the origin of life,

00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:15.720
I know have made molecules where hexoses

00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:19.620
replaced the riboses in
this particular position,

00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:21.610
and they did perfectly well.

00:25:21.610 --> 00:25:23.860
They had the bases on the hexose,

00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:25.580
but in fact, they did not have the right

00:25:25.580 --> 00:25:30.460
physical/chemical properties
as we understand them today,

00:25:30.460 --> 00:25:33.610
to be ribonucleic acids.

00:25:33.610 --> 00:25:38.390
However, we do have to
admit that there could be

00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:44.350
a series of molecules that
did not have quite the same

00:25:45.050 --> 00:25:49.510
chemical composition as today's RNA does.

00:25:49.510 --> 00:25:52.610
So we can admit that, but
we're not going to discuss it

00:25:52.610 --> 00:25:54.083
any further at the moment.

00:25:56.630 --> 00:26:00.640
Now, here is the
classical, iconic equation

00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:06.480
about information transfer today.

00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:08.303
That is to say we have DNA,

00:26:09.602 --> 00:26:13.453
can be copied into RNA, which
can be copied back into DNA,

00:26:14.770 --> 00:26:19.770
and then RNA can go to
what are called ribosomes,

00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:24.350
and the information RNA
will be made into proteins.

00:26:24.350 --> 00:26:27.680
And you notice here I
put genetic information.

00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:31.867
Genetic information because
they all have sequences of bases

00:26:31.867 --> 00:26:34.593
and here we have structure
and biochemical catalysis.

00:26:37.610 --> 00:26:40.200
You can designate
certain parts of proteins

00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:43.750
as having certain kinds of information,

00:26:43.750 --> 00:26:47.362
but we have no way of
knowing how that information

00:26:47.362 --> 00:26:51.010
can be replicated and transmitted exactly

00:26:51.010 --> 00:26:53.630
to another molecule or protein.

00:26:53.630 --> 00:26:56.300
We just don't know how
it's going to happen,

00:26:56.300 --> 00:26:58.030
and because we don't know,

00:26:58.030 --> 00:27:01.923
that effects entirely our
notions about the origin of life.

00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:07.300
This is another drawing
which is abbreviated

00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:10.520
from the one I talked about a minute ago.

00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:12.273
We have the same position here,

00:27:13.340 --> 00:27:15.590
but in this particular case,

00:27:15.590 --> 00:27:17.930
we're going to eliminate protein,

00:27:17.930 --> 00:27:22.040
because in the original central
dogma which I indicated,

00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:26.460
all those transformations of
DNA making RNA back to DNA,

00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:29.870
DNA replicating itself,
RNA replicating itself,

00:27:29.870 --> 00:27:34.430
they're all carried out by
proteins or protein enzymes.

00:27:34.430 --> 00:27:37.260
And we'll talk about
enzymes in a few minutes.

00:27:37.260 --> 00:27:41.000
But if we say that proteins didn't exist

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:42.180
at the beginning of life

00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:43.720
because there's no way you could copy

00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:47.760
the information of proteins
and make more proteins from it,

00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:50.713
then we're left with this situation here.

00:27:52.150 --> 00:27:57.150
As it happens, it was then
found that RNA could carry out

00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:00.853
some very simple biochemical reactions.

00:28:01.820 --> 00:28:04.020
This was done by Cech,

00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:07.270
in which he showed that
RNA could cleave itself,

00:28:07.270 --> 00:28:09.260
under certain conditions,

00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:13.470
and our lab work where we showed
the RNA associating with a

00:28:13.470 --> 00:28:16.363
protein subunit could
cleave other pieces of RNA.

00:28:17.490 --> 00:28:20.730
Now, as scientists always do,

00:28:20.730 --> 00:28:25.730
and in fact, this is a
classic example of that

00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:28.860
and the example really
was given by Wally Gilbert

00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:30.723
in a short paper he wrote.

00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:34.950
It wasn't a paper, it was a
comment he wrote for Nature,

00:28:34.950 --> 00:28:37.270
and he was a physicist really,

00:28:37.270 --> 00:28:39.710
but he became a molecular biologist.

00:28:39.710 --> 00:28:41.480
You take one or two examples

00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:46.480
and you generalize that
completely into a new theory

00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:51.680
encompassing very many problems and events

00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:56.680
in one particular, smaller,
two or three small sentences.

00:28:56.860 --> 00:29:00.577
He said, "Now you have information in RNA

00:29:00.577 --> 00:29:02.257
"with biochemical catalysis."

00:29:03.310 --> 00:29:05.770
Okay, information RNA.

00:29:05.770 --> 00:29:07.730
And before Wally got onto the scene,

00:29:07.730 --> 00:29:11.430
we could say, "This
has a possible future."

00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:13.650
Then Wally said, with one or two events

00:29:13.650 --> 00:29:15.780
of the kind we're talking about,

00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:19.113
that means that RNA could
have any kind of catalysis,

00:29:21.580 --> 00:29:25.963
and therefore, it could carry
out metabolism inside cells.

00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:32.160
So life is possible now with only RNA

00:29:32.260 --> 00:29:35.783
containing the information
and biochemical catalysis.

00:29:36.620 --> 00:29:40.100
And then he said we don't need DNA at all

00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:41.638
across the cellular.

00:29:41.638 --> 00:29:43.500
It's just not necessary.

00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:45.070
We have RNA,

00:29:45.070 --> 00:29:48.560
presumably it could make
itself under some conditions,

00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:51.110
it could carry out metabolic reactions.

00:29:51.110 --> 00:29:53.720
This is all we know, and
that was the beginning,

00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:55.563
and he called it the RNA world.

00:29:56.990 --> 00:30:01.990
So most of the thinking
about these events now

00:30:02.150 --> 00:30:04.930
are directed to the RNA world,

00:30:04.930 --> 00:30:07.583
and really that's what
we have to wonder about.

00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:13.380
Now, this is a very old slide

00:30:13.380 --> 00:30:16.340
that Hugh Robertson made many years ago,

00:30:16.340 --> 00:30:19.130
and it just illustrates
what kind of structures

00:30:19.130 --> 00:30:21.370
RNA can be involved in.

00:30:21.370 --> 00:30:25.810
First of all, when you have
something that looks like this,

00:30:25.810 --> 00:30:28.820
which you can call a
double-stranded piece of RNA,

00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:31.600
there are actually these bases here

00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:35.530
are joined together by very
weak bonds called hydrogen bonds

00:30:35.530 --> 00:30:38.350
and the hydrogen bond was
suggested by Linus Pauling

00:30:38.350 --> 00:30:40.340
back around 1940,

00:30:40.340 --> 00:30:42.630
and I thought it was much more important

00:30:42.630 --> 00:30:44.593
than the structure of proteins.

00:30:46.860 --> 00:30:50.040
So here's another place where
you have another particular

00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:53.090
double-stranded region held
together by hydrogen bonds.

00:30:53.090 --> 00:30:58.090
And here are particular bases,
A, U, C, G, U, A, et cetera,

00:30:58.150 --> 00:30:59.950
where we know where
the hydrogen bonds are.

00:30:59.950 --> 00:31:01.790
They're stuck together here.

00:31:01.790 --> 00:31:03.730
Here's another one here.

00:31:03.730 --> 00:31:08.130
The point is that we have
many sequences in RNA

00:31:08.130 --> 00:31:11.610
where you have the supposed hairpins here,

00:31:11.610 --> 00:31:15.680
and in fact, if you look
at any stretch of RNA,

00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:17.740
you will find hairpins.

00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:19.470
There's no question about it

00:31:19.470 --> 00:31:22.950
that the bases occur
of sufficient frequency

00:31:22.950 --> 00:31:25.823
so that you will find
regions like this in RNA.

00:31:27.450 --> 00:31:30.840
In fact, this is another diagram

00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:32.640
taken from something
that was written about

00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:34.013
10 years ago or so.

00:31:34.870 --> 00:31:39.163
If you have a region of RNA
with a number of hairpins in it,

00:31:40.940 --> 00:31:45.780
and then you have something
like the RNA subunit of RNase P,

00:31:45.780 --> 00:31:49.300
which could many years ago
be called something else.

00:31:49.300 --> 00:31:52.120
We call it M1 for various reasons.

00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:55.030
We know how this cleaves RNA.

00:31:55.030 --> 00:31:57.540
It actually cuts the region between

00:31:57.540 --> 00:32:00.670
the beginning of the double
strand here in a single strand.

00:32:00.670 --> 00:32:04.680
So this is left by itself.

00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:05.760
Here's another cut here.

00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:07.930
You're left with this hairpin by itself.

00:32:07.930 --> 00:32:08.900
Here's another cut here.

00:32:08.900 --> 00:32:11.370
So you're left with a
bunch of different hairpins

00:32:11.370 --> 00:32:14.820
with sizes down here of different lengths.

00:32:14.820 --> 00:32:18.300
And then you could well imagine
that you might, for example,

00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:21.947
attach a pre-nucleotide
sequence here, C-C-A,

00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:25.510
and that in fact can happen inorganically,

00:32:25.510 --> 00:32:27.020
we know that happens.

00:32:27.020 --> 00:32:30.120
And ultimately from this, you
might wind up with something

00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:31.877
that looks like a piece of transfer RNA,

00:32:31.877 --> 00:32:35.340
and transfer RNA is very important today.

00:32:35.340 --> 00:32:37.403
It's involved in protein synthesis.

00:32:38.310 --> 00:32:42.510
So this is a speculative by simple idea

00:32:42.510 --> 00:32:47.280
of how very simple chemical reactions

00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:50.163
can occur in RNA a very long time ago.

00:32:52.790 --> 00:32:57.780
Now, there was some notion

00:32:57.780 --> 00:33:01.880
after Gilbert suggested the RNA world

00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:05.150
that we really ought to look
for other enzymatic reactions

00:33:05.150 --> 00:33:06.870
carried out by RNA.

00:33:06.870 --> 00:33:09.220
We do know of some other
reactions at the moment,

00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:10.970
but there aren't very many of them.

00:33:11.838 --> 00:33:15.760
And they fall into a very specific class.

00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:17.793
They're no more than five or so.

00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:22.113
Larry Gold, who is at the
University of Colorado,

00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:26.010
devised a technique, and
it's illustrate here,

00:33:26.010 --> 00:33:29.010
but I'm not gonna go
through it all in detail.

00:33:29.010 --> 00:33:31.490
In fact, I would suggest for those of you

00:33:31.490 --> 00:33:36.490
who don't understand anything
I say, just forget it.

00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:39.466
Just think about the more important,

00:33:39.466 --> 00:33:42.823
well what I think are the
more important things.

00:33:43.850 --> 00:33:45.193
Larry said the following,

00:33:46.060 --> 00:33:49.330
if you make a randomized piece of RNA--

00:33:49.330 --> 00:33:52.000
By randomized, I mean the following.

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:55.283
That is to say, you can chemically
make a piece of RNA now,

00:33:56.378 --> 00:34:01.183
and you can put in a specific
base at every position.

00:34:02.130 --> 00:34:04.710
But Larry said, we'll
put in all four bases

00:34:04.710 --> 00:34:08.730
at every position so that
you could make one sequence,

00:34:08.730 --> 00:34:10.610
you've put in four bases at one position.

00:34:10.610 --> 00:34:14.070
That means you now have four
different sequences, et cetera.

00:34:14.070 --> 00:34:17.410
So he made a piece of RNA that had

00:34:17.410 --> 00:34:21.300
maybe 75 or so random
RNA nucleotides in it

00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:24.170
and did a reaction to--

00:34:24.170 --> 00:34:27.270
Well, he made this, it was in a test tube,

00:34:27.270 --> 00:34:31.530
he maybe had a mil, one
milliliter of the reaction,

00:34:31.530 --> 00:34:34.000
which might have had a trillion trillion

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.280
different sequences in it.

00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:41.280
He said now, if you have a
very special way of selecting

00:34:41.670 --> 00:34:46.670
for a particular function
from this series,

00:34:47.780 --> 00:34:50.940
and I won't go into the details yet.

00:34:50.940 --> 00:34:52.673
Here's the RNA population.

00:34:53.730 --> 00:34:58.000
We have a means of selecting
one particular function for it.

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:01.520
That means that out of the
trillion trillion pieces of RNA,

00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:05.823
we have one RNA that has
the function we want.

00:35:06.730 --> 00:35:10.340
Then using the tricks of
molecular biology at that time,

00:35:10.340 --> 00:35:11.900
which is cDNA synthesis,

00:35:11.900 --> 00:35:16.270
which is to make DNA from
this selected piece of RNA

00:35:16.270 --> 00:35:19.970
and then amplify it with PCR amplification

00:35:19.970 --> 00:35:21.810
which even high school students

00:35:21.810 --> 00:35:23.890
know how to do that right now,

00:35:23.890 --> 00:35:27.640
but I would surmise that they
know nothing about the details

00:35:28.770 --> 00:35:32.057
then you can in fact amplify
that one piece of RNA

00:35:32.057 --> 00:35:35.140
into a million and a million pieces of RNA

00:35:35.140 --> 00:35:37.500
and then you can characterize it.

00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:42.440
So that was a very clever
and important reaction

00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:44.920
that Gold hypothesized.

00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:48.960
And let's just talk
about what an enzyme is.

00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:50.960
An enzyme is a catalyst.

00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:54.930
If you put many years ago
lead in your gasoline,

00:35:54.930 --> 00:35:57.460
it accelerated the combustion of gasoline.

00:35:57.460 --> 00:35:59.600
So lead was a catalyst.

00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:02.880
In biochemistry, an enzyme's a catalyst

00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:05.610
that works in a chemical
sense over and over

00:36:05.610 --> 00:36:09.540
again on another class
of molecules, substrates,

00:36:09.540 --> 00:36:12.990
substrates here, and is
unchanged by the reaction.

00:36:12.990 --> 00:36:14.830
So one of the enzymes we can talk about

00:36:14.830 --> 00:36:17.760
is Ribonuclease P or its RNA subunit,

00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:20.070
and it's substrate is other RNA molecules,

00:36:20.070 --> 00:36:21.280
it just cuts them.

00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:23.280
So that's an enzyme, that's a substrate.

00:36:24.490 --> 00:36:28.325
Now, about 10 years ago, I
made this particular list

00:36:28.325 --> 00:36:32.220
of enzymes using Gold's technique

00:36:32.220 --> 00:36:35.870
which people had already
isolated and characterized.

00:36:35.870 --> 00:36:38.900
And you can see many of
the particular enzymes

00:36:38.900 --> 00:36:43.900
that are involved in effective
replication and metabolism

00:36:44.096 --> 00:36:48.110
in DNA inside cells today.

00:36:48.110 --> 00:36:50.424
And if you did this again today,

00:36:50.424 --> 00:36:53.840
it would have maybe three
times as many enzymes involved.

00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:58.670
So there doesn't seem to be any inhibition

00:36:58.670 --> 00:37:03.270
in RNA having any particular
enzyme you could imagine,

00:37:03.270 --> 00:37:05.900
and the idea is that in
each one of these cases,

00:37:05.900 --> 00:37:08.319
the RNA that we're talking
about would be folded

00:37:08.319 --> 00:37:12.080
in a different way to
encompass its substrate

00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:15.513
and then perform a
chemical reaction with it.

00:37:16.420 --> 00:37:19.560
And we also have RNA with
small molecules attached.

00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:23.360
We've recently shown that a
perimeting synthesis can occur.

00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:25.120
That's one class of bases.

00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:28.160
This has nothing to do
with Gold's technique,

00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:30.640
but it's been shown that this can be done.

00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:32.690
And we have RNA self replication,

00:37:32.690 --> 00:37:34.070
which I'll talk about briefly.

00:37:34.070 --> 00:37:38.070
This is another success in terms of RNA

00:37:38.070 --> 00:37:42.220
and in showing that the RNA
world existed at some level.

00:37:42.220 --> 00:37:46.000
The question is why doesn't it exist now?

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:48.810
We haven't found any of these
reactions in nature today.

00:37:48.810 --> 00:37:50.700
We can make them in a test tube,

00:37:50.700 --> 00:37:52.630
but we haven't found them at all.

00:37:52.630 --> 00:37:57.240
The question is one, were there
random pieces of RNA around

00:37:57.240 --> 00:38:01.110
so that you had the ability
to choose one specific one

00:38:01.110 --> 00:38:03.460
from everything you did at one time?

00:38:03.460 --> 00:38:06.450
And secondly, was there enough time around

00:38:06.450 --> 00:38:08.330
for you to do everything?

00:38:08.330 --> 00:38:10.623
It's not clear that that is the case.

00:38:13.230 --> 00:38:17.800
This is just a diagram of an
RNA self replication scheme

00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:20.280
that Jerry Joyce at the Salk Institute

00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:22.083
published about a year or so ago.

00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:25.210
Let me just say that he
showed it could work.

00:38:26.097 --> 00:38:28.120
Now with two pieces of RNA in a reaction,

00:38:28.120 --> 00:38:32.160
he showed that they could
replicate themselves entirely.

00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:34.310
So there's no protein involved here.

00:38:34.310 --> 00:38:36.990
It's just the RNA which replicates itself,

00:38:36.990 --> 00:38:39.560
and I'll just very briefly go over it.

00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:42.030
Here you have one piece of RNA,

00:38:42.030 --> 00:38:44.350
and another piece of RNA here.

00:38:44.350 --> 00:38:46.820
Okay, here they are here and here.

00:38:46.820 --> 00:38:48.850
Then you have an enzymatic reaction

00:38:48.850 --> 00:38:51.197
which joins this piece to this piece.

00:38:51.197 --> 00:38:54.190
Now we know that RNA can do that.

00:38:54.190 --> 00:38:55.750
Okay?

00:38:55.750 --> 00:38:59.823
So now we have these two
pieces completely joined.

00:39:01.230 --> 00:39:03.653
This is the other reaction going on here.

00:39:04.820 --> 00:39:09.540
And now this is an enzyme
of one kind presumably.

00:39:09.540 --> 00:39:11.020
Here it is here.

00:39:11.020 --> 00:39:16.020
Here again is A and B, but
the complexes look different

00:39:16.550 --> 00:39:19.457
because they're the complements
of the original strand here

00:39:19.457 --> 00:39:22.360
and we can go on and on
and on in this cycle,

00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:25.610
and I'm not gonna talk about
that anymore at this point.

00:39:25.610 --> 00:39:28.780
It's just showing
replication can take place

00:39:28.780 --> 00:39:31.030
if you're clever enough
in thinking about it.

00:39:32.750 --> 00:39:34.870
Now let me talk a little bit about

00:39:34.870 --> 00:39:36.823
what we know about RNA today.

00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:43.440
This is just a very small
summary of catalytic RNAs today.

00:39:43.450 --> 00:39:46.010
In fact, the summary if
I drew a complete list

00:39:46.010 --> 00:39:49.440
would not be very much bigger than this.

00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:50.900
So this is important

00:39:50.900 --> 00:39:55.900
because this we think are
reactions of catalysis by RNA

00:39:58.170 --> 00:40:00.760
which are probably very ancient reactions,

00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:03.450
and I'm not gonna go into the arguments

00:40:03.450 --> 00:40:06.170
about why they're very ancient,

00:40:06.170 --> 00:40:08.123
but they exist in today's world.

00:40:10.210 --> 00:40:12.380
There's the RNA subunit of RNase P

00:40:13.870 --> 00:40:15.920
with its cleavage of other RNA.

00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:19.950
Group I introns, which was
discovered by Tom Cech.

00:40:19.950 --> 00:40:22.363
He showed that in a piece of RNA,

00:40:23.580 --> 00:40:25.293
which is let's say this long,

00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:30.270
there is one piece here that
functioned inside the cell

00:40:30.270 --> 00:40:33.170
and another piece here that
functioned inside the cell,

00:40:33.170 --> 00:40:37.740
and in between, there was another region

00:40:37.740 --> 00:40:40.440
that did not function inside the cell.

00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:45.440
And he showed that that region
in between could be cut out

00:40:45.750 --> 00:40:48.500
and the two end regions
could be joined together

00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:51.410
in what is called a splicing reaction.

00:40:51.410 --> 00:40:55.250
So that was a very
important reaction to show.

00:40:55.250 --> 00:40:56.780
Group II introns are similar.

00:40:56.780 --> 00:40:58.460
They were discovered later.

00:40:58.460 --> 00:41:01.693
These particular reactions
are very important reactions.

00:41:02.670 --> 00:41:06.810
Plant viroid RNAs are
about 350 nucleotides long

00:41:06.810 --> 00:41:08.890
so they're pretty small.

00:41:08.890 --> 00:41:12.880
They don't code for any proteins at all,

00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:15.413
and they're circular, and
they're single-stranded.

00:41:16.390 --> 00:41:19.793
So in fact, you could have
a little bit of plant viroid

00:41:19.793 --> 00:41:21.920
on your fingertips

00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:25.350
and rub it into the leaf of the plant

00:41:25.350 --> 00:41:27.830
that is the host for this viral RNA,

00:41:27.830 --> 00:41:31.210
and that plant will become
sick entirely and die

00:41:31.210 --> 00:41:34.350
within 30 days, let's say,
if it's a tomato plant

00:41:34.350 --> 00:41:35.960
or something like that.

00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:39.380
So plant viroid RNAs are
very important pathogens

00:41:39.380 --> 00:41:40.730
for plants.

00:41:40.730 --> 00:41:44.120
Many of the commercially important plants

00:41:44.120 --> 00:41:45.367
have plant viroids,

00:41:45.367 --> 00:41:48.970
and we have to prevent the
viroids from infecting them.

00:41:48.970 --> 00:41:51.870
Hepatitis delta RNA is a little bit,

00:41:51.870 --> 00:41:54.230
not much different but
a little bit different.

00:41:54.230 --> 00:41:58.160
It's 1600 nucleotides long,
it codes for one protein.

00:41:58.160 --> 00:41:59.730
It's single-stranded.

00:41:59.730 --> 00:42:02.471
It can be found in the human bloodstream,

00:42:02.471 --> 00:42:07.471
but if you have hepatitis
B virus in your bloodstream

00:42:08.420 --> 00:42:12.440
and you also have the hepatitis delta RNA,

00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:14.950
you're dead within three weeks.

00:42:14.950 --> 00:42:19.950
So the hepatitis delta
RNA makes hepatitis B

00:42:20.490 --> 00:42:24.340
a serious and lethal disease.

00:42:24.340 --> 00:42:28.310
Normally, not normally but yeah normally,

00:42:28.310 --> 00:42:31.100
you can live for several years
with a hepatitis B infection.

00:42:31.100 --> 00:42:33.370
You might get sick one way or the other,

00:42:33.370 --> 00:42:35.680
and in some people, it
develops into a cancer,

00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:39.060
but it is nothing that will
destroy you in three weeks.

00:42:39.060 --> 00:42:42.900
And in certain parts of the
world, normally southeast Asia,

00:42:42.900 --> 00:42:46.640
the blood banks constantly
screen their supplies

00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:48.467
for hepatitis delta RNA.

00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:51.750
That's just an aside.

00:42:51.750 --> 00:42:55.760
There's a fungal virus that
has an RNA that cleaves itself,

00:42:55.760 --> 00:43:00.350
and recently, we have
evidence that RNA in ribosomes

00:43:00.350 --> 00:43:05.350
at the peptide elongation
site also is an RNA enzyme.

00:43:05.460 --> 00:43:08.500
That is to say the RNAs by themselves

00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:11.920
will join one amino acid to another.

00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:15.170
Now this is extrapolating a little bit

00:43:15.170 --> 00:43:18.140
from what we know about
the crystals of ribosomes,

00:43:18.140 --> 00:43:19.600
which have been just described

00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:22.480
in the last 7 or 8 years or so.

00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:26.650
It appears if you draw a
sphere around the point

00:43:26.650 --> 00:43:29.850
where two amino acids get joined together,

00:43:29.850 --> 00:43:34.270
there is no protein in
that sphere but simply RNA.

00:43:34.270 --> 00:43:35.710
And that's the reason for saying

00:43:35.710 --> 00:43:40.710
that the ribosomal RNA is a RNA enzyme.

00:43:41.830 --> 00:43:42.750
There are some people,

00:43:42.750 --> 00:43:45.940
in fact some rather
prominent ribosomologists,

00:43:45.940 --> 00:43:48.780
who disagree with that
statement, but that's okay.

00:43:48.780 --> 00:43:50.680
We'll accept that for the moment.

00:43:50.680 --> 00:43:55.360
And splicing RNAs, there are
various complexes inside cells

00:43:55.360 --> 00:43:57.793
which aid in splicing pieces of RNA,

00:43:58.670 --> 00:44:01.350
can perform an artificial
splicing reaction

00:44:01.350 --> 00:44:05.500
by themselves in vitro,
but it's not important.

00:44:05.500 --> 00:44:06.700
That one, remember this.

00:44:06.700 --> 00:44:08.050
One simply has to remember

00:44:08.050 --> 00:44:09.940
that there are several different reactions

00:44:09.940 --> 00:44:11.373
where we know this happens.

00:44:12.730 --> 00:44:15.810
Now, I'm gonna talk very, very briefly

00:44:15.810 --> 00:44:19.720
about RNase P and a
couple of other reactions.

00:44:19.720 --> 00:44:23.500
What I've shown here is a tRNA.

00:44:23.500 --> 00:44:27.760
This structure here in two
dimensions is a transfer RNA.

00:44:27.760 --> 00:44:30.590
The dots indicate hydrogen bonds

00:44:30.590 --> 00:44:32.733
joining these pieces together.

00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:37.790
And this sequence up here
is actually made from DNA.

00:44:37.790 --> 00:44:40.240
When you're making this piece of RNA,

00:44:40.240 --> 00:44:42.810
but we don't need it inside the cell.

00:44:42.810 --> 00:44:46.800
And the enzyme I'm talking
about, the RNA subunit of RNase P

00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:49.200
cuts it right here,

00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:53.920
and it cuts all tRNA
precursors in all organisms

00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:55.936
at this particular point.

00:44:55.936 --> 00:44:58.033
So that's one thing we know about.

00:44:59.500 --> 00:45:03.510
This is the Cech reaction
which I discussed.

00:45:03.510 --> 00:45:06.050
Here are the two pieces
which are important,

00:45:06.050 --> 00:45:10.010
and this piece and the
intermediate here get spliced out.

00:45:10.010 --> 00:45:12.180
There are two parts of the reaction.

00:45:12.180 --> 00:45:17.180
There's a G that's at the prime
site here, one side of it,

00:45:17.340 --> 00:45:18.890
and that gets cut out.

00:45:18.890 --> 00:45:22.180
And then there's a hydroxyl group here,

00:45:22.180 --> 00:45:25.280
and that moves over here,
and then we cut that out,

00:45:25.280 --> 00:45:27.578
and we're left with this
particular reaction here

00:45:27.578 --> 00:45:31.070
which are the two pieces joined together.

00:45:31.070 --> 00:45:33.450
And we're left with this piece here,

00:45:33.450 --> 00:45:38.060
which is called an intron,
as a separate molecule here.

00:45:38.060 --> 00:45:39.717
So this is a reaction,

00:45:39.717 --> 00:45:41.710
and we don't have to worry
about this circle here.

00:45:41.710 --> 00:45:44.308
Actually, it's just a linear piece here.

00:45:44.308 --> 00:45:48.300
This reaction is a cell splicing reaction,

00:45:48.300 --> 00:45:50.820
which from the definition of enzymes

00:45:50.820 --> 00:45:52.823
means it's not a real enzyme.

00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:57.800
But this product of the reaction here

00:45:57.800 --> 00:46:01.830
can with various minor modifications

00:46:01.830 --> 00:46:04.790
be turned into an enzyme,
but it doesn't work that way

00:46:04.790 --> 00:46:06.053
normally in nature.

00:46:09.160 --> 00:46:13.480
This is another view of the central dogma

00:46:13.480 --> 00:46:18.480
as I drew it before, but
this is today's view.

00:46:18.750 --> 00:46:22.163
And this appeared in
another paper recently,

00:46:23.090 --> 00:46:25.330
and it simply indicates
to you that the world

00:46:25.330 --> 00:46:28.663
is much more complicated
than we had thought.

00:46:30.400 --> 00:46:34.193
Here's DNA or chromatin
being made into RNA.

00:46:35.080 --> 00:46:39.410
And we have messenger RNA
here being made into proteins,

00:46:39.410 --> 00:46:41.370
but there are telomeres involved

00:46:41.370 --> 00:46:44.950
in making sure the DNA's the
right size and chromosomes.

00:46:44.950 --> 00:46:48.560
There's primer RNA involved
in replication of DNA.

00:46:48.560 --> 00:46:53.490
This RNA can be transcribed,
various pieces of RNA

00:46:53.490 --> 00:46:57.787
can be transcribed into
RNase P, a small nuclear RNA,

00:46:58.840 --> 00:47:01.910
these here, and oRNAs also.

00:47:01.910 --> 00:47:05.860
These work on tRNAs,
tmRNAs which we can talk,

00:47:05.860 --> 00:47:08.570
ribosomal RNA, 7SL RNA.

00:47:08.570 --> 00:47:11.360
These are all substrates
for these reactions.

00:47:11.360 --> 00:47:13.500
And these particular reactions here,

00:47:13.500 --> 00:47:18.500
pieces of RNA, micro RNA, siRNA,
other NC or noncoding RNAs

00:47:20.410 --> 00:47:23.790
are involved in regulating hundreds

00:47:23.790 --> 00:47:25.990
of developmental reactions.

00:47:25.990 --> 00:47:30.990
What I want to show here is
simply that these new RNAs here,

00:47:31.550 --> 00:47:35.250
which have been discovered
over the last 10 to 15 years,

00:47:35.250 --> 00:47:38.710
are where the action is
today in molecular biology.

00:47:38.710 --> 00:47:42.610
You might consider that
statement a bit of propaganda,

00:47:42.610 --> 00:47:45.671
but in fact, I think it's true.

00:47:45.671 --> 00:47:50.671
Those RNAs are essential in
controlling developmental events

00:47:51.180 --> 00:47:54.470
in higher organisms and
in fact lower organisms

00:47:54.470 --> 00:47:58.100
but not extremely primitive eukaryotes.

00:47:58.100 --> 00:48:03.100
And the future of biology
for the next 10 years or so

00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:05.510
depends upon our understanding

00:48:05.510 --> 00:48:07.373
of those particular reactions.

00:48:11.830 --> 00:48:14.543
These are just lists
of what we have to do,

00:48:15.540 --> 00:48:19.660
and I don't think it's
important to talk about those.

00:48:19.660 --> 00:48:24.300
One of the things that is
the hallmark of evolution

00:48:24.300 --> 00:48:25.880
as life went on,

00:48:25.880 --> 00:48:28.060
is that whatever systems
we're talking about

00:48:28.060 --> 00:48:29.940
became more complex.

00:48:29.940 --> 00:48:34.280
I'm not talking just about
bacteria becoming man ultimately.

00:48:34.280 --> 00:48:36.370
That's certainly complexity,

00:48:36.370 --> 00:48:38.813
but this is complexity
at the molecular level.

00:48:39.750 --> 00:48:43.890
So we have new genes and new mutations

00:48:43.890 --> 00:48:46.860
to aid in providing basic information.

00:48:46.860 --> 00:48:49.290
This is very important in terms of

00:48:49.290 --> 00:48:51.500
what we have learned
about molecular biology

00:48:51.500 --> 00:48:55.110
or about genetics in the
last five years or so.

00:48:55.110 --> 00:48:59.630
At the molecular level, we
utilize everything in the genome.

00:48:59.630 --> 00:49:01.890
There's no more junk DNA.

00:49:01.890 --> 00:49:06.110
All parts of DNA are utilized
in one way or another,

00:49:06.110 --> 00:49:07.890
in terms as we understand it now,

00:49:07.890 --> 00:49:11.080
to make noncoding RNA or micro RNA

00:49:11.080 --> 00:49:13.170
that control developmental events.

00:49:13.170 --> 00:49:16.290
We're just beginning to
understand noncoding RNAs

00:49:16.290 --> 00:49:21.060
which are RNAs of several
thousand nucleotides long,

00:49:21.060 --> 00:49:22.980
and we don't really know what they do.

00:49:22.980 --> 00:49:25.540
We do know what one of
them does certainly.

00:49:25.540 --> 00:49:29.940
That's the exist RNA, which
is important in inactivating

00:49:29.940 --> 00:49:32.560
an X chromosome in human females.

00:49:32.560 --> 00:49:36.920
Human females have two Xs,
and one of them is inactivated

00:49:36.920 --> 00:49:38.170
in all cells.

00:49:38.170 --> 00:49:42.490
And the exist RNA which is a
few thousand nucleotides long

00:49:42.490 --> 00:49:45.263
is critical for that particular function.

00:49:47.270 --> 00:49:51.110
And I won't talk about that
anymore at that moment.

00:49:51.110 --> 00:49:56.110
It's getting late, and I
wanted to end this lecture

00:49:57.370 --> 00:50:02.370
with a statement about
some of the people who have

00:50:09.320 --> 00:50:12.050
I won't say mentors because
they weren't really mentors.

00:50:12.050 --> 00:50:14.660
They're people I admired enormously

00:50:14.660 --> 00:50:16.613
as I was growing up in science,

00:50:17.510 --> 00:50:21.223
and they had a huge effect
on me of one kind or another.

00:50:23.060 --> 00:50:27.120
Leonard Vermin and Matt
Messelsen and Sidney Brenner,

00:50:27.120 --> 00:50:29.970
but there was one people who
I never actually worked for.

00:50:31.120 --> 00:50:34.280
He was one of the people at the lab

00:50:34.280 --> 00:50:37.470
where I was for two years in England,

00:50:37.470 --> 00:50:42.440
and he ultimately went on
to win two Nobel Prizes.

00:50:42.440 --> 00:50:44.730
His name was Fred Sanger.

00:50:44.730 --> 00:50:47.670
And I'm going to end this
lecture by reading very briefly

00:50:47.670 --> 00:50:52.290
something about Fred Sanger
that I wrote a few years ago.

00:50:52.290 --> 00:50:55.718
I was doing an experiment which
I was using radioactivity,

00:50:55.718 --> 00:50:58.870
radioactive phosphorous
in much higher quantities

00:50:58.870 --> 00:51:00.900
than we use them now,

00:51:00.900 --> 00:51:04.220
and I had spilled something on my desk,

00:51:04.220 --> 00:51:07.290
and it was a sufficiently large accident

00:51:07.290 --> 00:51:10.882
that I felt I had to tell
the people responsible.

00:51:10.882 --> 00:51:14.240
And the person I wound
up with was Fred Sanger

00:51:14.240 --> 00:51:17.420
from his lab upstairs from mine.

00:51:17.420 --> 00:51:19.393
And so this is what I'm going to read.

00:51:20.850 --> 00:51:23.670
Fred listened to me and came
downstairs to the second floor.

00:51:23.670 --> 00:51:28.350
Without a word, he put on some
rubber dishwashing gloves,

00:51:28.350 --> 00:51:31.190
grabbed a can of Ajax and some sponges

00:51:31.190 --> 00:51:33.640
and knelt down to try to
see how much radioactivity

00:51:33.640 --> 00:51:35.574
he could get off the floor.

00:51:35.574 --> 00:51:37.450
Not much.

00:51:37.450 --> 00:51:38.990
I objected to what he was doing,

00:51:38.990 --> 00:51:41.690
because I thought I
should be doing that job.

00:51:41.690 --> 00:51:44.630
And quite soon, he said
that I had done enough

00:51:44.630 --> 00:51:47.210
and decided to clear the area.

00:51:47.210 --> 00:51:49.980
I stripped my clothing
off, donned a labcoat,

00:51:49.980 --> 00:51:53.180
and drove home where I left
the clothes in the coal shed

00:51:53.180 --> 00:51:54.303
to cool off.

00:51:55.180 --> 00:51:58.860
Hugh Robertson called the
contaminated space Yucka Flats,

00:51:58.860 --> 00:52:01.540
which I thought was pretty good.

00:52:01.540 --> 00:52:04.040
Sometime later, that
whole floor and bench area

00:52:04.040 --> 00:52:04.953
were removed.

00:52:06.410 --> 00:52:09.590
I cannot imagine a person
of Fred's reputation

00:52:10.470 --> 00:52:13.770
taking on such a modest and thankless task

00:52:13.770 --> 00:52:16.210
and refusing any help.

00:52:16.210 --> 00:52:19.490
The image of him on his knees on the floor

00:52:19.490 --> 00:52:22.880
trying to wash away the
radioactivity I had spilled

00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:25.530
is still fresh in mind.

00:52:25.530 --> 00:52:27.830
There are many ways, I suppose,

00:52:27.830 --> 00:52:30.740
of exhibiting humility and greatness,

00:52:30.740 --> 00:52:32.053
and this was one of them.

00:52:33.103 --> 00:52:34.682
Thank you.

00:52:34.682 --> 00:52:37.849
(audience applauding)

00:52:42.100 --> 00:52:43.700
Well the question is could I speculate

00:52:43.700 --> 00:52:47.270
about the possibility
of an actual organism

00:52:47.270 --> 00:52:50.383
that had no protein at
all and it was just RNA.

00:52:54.840 --> 00:52:59.420
I doubt whether that existed
at any particular time but

00:53:01.170 --> 00:53:05.210
anything I say now can be
used against me in court

00:53:05.210 --> 00:53:06.043
at any time.

00:53:10.650 --> 00:53:12.264
One of the kinds of experiments

00:53:12.264 --> 00:53:15.180
some people are doing at the moment,

00:53:15.180 --> 00:53:20.180
is to make lipid spheres in which case

00:53:21.610 --> 00:53:26.610
you then try and have
RNA enclosed by the lipid

00:53:27.450 --> 00:53:31.620
or you have RNA going
through a hole in the lipid.

00:53:31.620 --> 00:53:34.820
The idea is that lipids or fatty molecules

00:53:34.820 --> 00:53:37.760
make up most of our cell
membranes and walls,

00:53:37.760 --> 00:53:39.470
so that is important.

00:53:39.470 --> 00:53:43.818
Now, we are learning something
about making the lipids,

00:53:43.818 --> 00:53:48.818
but it strikes me as being
very remotely possible

00:53:49.570 --> 00:53:53.220
that there might be RNA with
a metabolism at the moment.

00:53:53.220 --> 00:53:56.350
You have to have all those
RNAs I mentioned before

00:53:56.350 --> 00:53:58.383
carry out catabolic reactions.

00:53:59.340 --> 00:54:01.900
I doubt that that's possible.

00:54:01.900 --> 00:54:06.900
We might be able to talk
about very small lipid spheres

00:54:08.590 --> 00:54:10.400
with one or two things going on it

00:54:10.400 --> 00:54:12.600
that ultimately evolved to something else,

00:54:12.600 --> 00:54:15.170
but that's about all I'll say to that.

00:54:17.890 --> 00:54:20.090
- [Audience Member] So
considering our estimates

00:54:20.090 --> 00:54:22.380
of the age and size of the universe

00:54:22.380 --> 00:54:25.510
and considering your own personal guess

00:54:25.510 --> 00:54:29.970
at the unlikelihood of
unique origins of life,

00:54:29.970 --> 00:54:33.830
would you say that our universe
is old enough and big enough

00:54:33.830 --> 00:54:36.340
to allow for two unique origins of life?

00:54:36.340 --> 00:54:38.210
And although I'll accept a grunt,

00:54:38.210 --> 00:54:40.160
I would prefer something more concrete.

00:54:41.500 --> 00:54:43.940
- You're saying that there
could be two different origins?

00:54:43.940 --> 00:54:45.483
Yeah, sure, no problem.

00:54:46.520 --> 00:54:50.310
There are reasonable
estimates now that there

00:54:51.193 --> 00:54:55.430
are possibly hundreds of
Earth-like planets in the universe

00:54:55.430 --> 00:54:58.373
which we're just waiting to discover.

00:54:59.380 --> 00:55:02.750
And the idea that one of them might have

00:55:02.750 --> 00:55:06.540
conditions like those on
Earth, it's quite possible.

00:55:06.540 --> 00:55:11.010
So without any hesitation, I'll
say that it's quite possible

00:55:11.010 --> 00:55:14.860
there's another source of life
somewhere in the universe.

00:55:14.860 --> 00:55:17.650
It may not be life as we recognize it,

00:55:17.650 --> 00:55:19.883
but that's okay.

00:55:21.450 --> 00:55:22.840
- [Audience Member] So I'm
one of those geochemists

00:55:22.840 --> 00:55:24.520
that actually tries to disentangle

00:55:24.520 --> 00:55:26.270
what the early Earth was like,

00:55:26.270 --> 00:55:28.630
and a lot of my friends are geobiologists

00:55:28.630 --> 00:55:31.580
who study things like
hopanoids and other molecules

00:55:31.580 --> 00:55:36.580
that may be biomarkers of early,
I'd say, unicellular life.

00:55:38.500 --> 00:55:41.030
But we don't talk to you guys that often,

00:55:41.030 --> 00:55:41.863
and so I want to know

00:55:41.863 --> 00:55:44.364
from a molecular biologist's perspective,

00:55:44.364 --> 00:55:48.630
what sort of signatures
could we be looking for?

00:55:48.630 --> 00:55:51.940
Again, I work on the inorganic stuff,

00:55:51.940 --> 00:55:56.070
but I'm curious because it
felt a little disparaging.

00:55:56.070 --> 00:55:57.870
- [Altman] Signatures of
the existence of life?

00:55:57.870 --> 00:55:58.703
- Sure.

00:55:59.950 --> 00:56:01.790
Or you know the--

00:56:01.790 --> 00:56:03.610
Once you go back far
enough in the rock record,

00:56:03.610 --> 00:56:05.820
things are very much degraded.

00:56:05.820 --> 00:56:08.290
There's not much that we
actually have from early

00:56:08.290 --> 00:56:10.206
when things may have started.

00:56:10.206 --> 00:56:11.850
- Well, if we're looking
for life as we know it,

00:56:11.850 --> 00:56:15.490
then one has to look for
the existence of a polymer

00:56:15.490 --> 00:56:17.623
that has information, okay?

00:56:18.775 --> 00:56:20.775
That could be something like RNA or DNA.

00:56:22.530 --> 00:56:25.530
But what people have looked
for in the past for example

00:56:25.530 --> 00:56:30.530
on the probes of Mars is metabolism

00:56:30.730 --> 00:56:33.173
and the production of
certain kinds of gasses.

00:56:34.720 --> 00:56:36.100
So what else can I say?

00:56:36.100 --> 00:56:37.040
That's what people do.

00:56:37.040 --> 00:56:39.210
I mean it's simple to look for metabolites

00:56:39.210 --> 00:56:42.090
of one kind or another
that we know do not exist

00:56:42.090 --> 00:56:43.473
in the inorganic world.

00:56:44.350 --> 00:56:46.207
- [Audience Member] Okay, just curious.

00:56:46.207 --> 00:56:47.950
- [Male Audience Member]
Why do you think the bases

00:56:47.950 --> 00:56:51.920
are restricted to the
five bases in DNA and RNA

00:56:52.780 --> 00:56:54.880
when I understand that
there are many other bases

00:56:54.880 --> 00:56:56.990
that could possibly fit in?

00:56:56.990 --> 00:57:01.460
- Yeah, well people actually
have synthesized other bases

00:57:02.950 --> 00:57:06.560
which have the ability to hydrogen bond,

00:57:06.560 --> 00:57:09.360
and they can use these other bases,

00:57:09.360 --> 00:57:12.710
which are not like the ones,
the five that we talked about

00:57:12.710 --> 00:57:14.690
or four that I talked about,

00:57:14.690 --> 00:57:18.023
and they work in terms of
reactions in test tube.

00:57:19.350 --> 00:57:23.530
So that's why I say with
some degree of certainty

00:57:23.530 --> 00:57:25.790
that it's likely that we
might have had something else

00:57:25.790 --> 00:57:28.883
other than recognizable RNA at one time.

00:57:33.258 --> 00:57:34.910
- [Lester] And again, let
us think Professor Altman

00:57:34.910 --> 00:57:37.324
for a very splendid,
interesting presentation.

00:57:37.324 --> 00:57:39.462
(audience applauding)

00:57:39.462 --> 00:57:43.379
