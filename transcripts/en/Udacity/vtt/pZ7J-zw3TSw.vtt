00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.400
So we can now update our test criteria subsumption. We start

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.700
from this situation in which there are no relationship between condition

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.650
coverage, branch coverage and statement coverage. And when we add branch

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:12.160
and condition coverage, we can mark the fact that branch and

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.470
condition coverage subsumes branch coverage

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:16.370
and also subsumes condition coverage, for

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:19.660
the same reason. Therefore, this is a stronger criterion than both

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.100
branch coverage and condition coverage, and of course indirectly also soft

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.330
statement coverage. So once more, to make sure we are all

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:29.255
on the same page, if I develop a test rate that satisfies branch and condition

00:00:29.255 --> 00:00:31.380
coverage, the same test will satisfy also

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.210
branch coverage, statement coverage and condition coverage, necessarily.
