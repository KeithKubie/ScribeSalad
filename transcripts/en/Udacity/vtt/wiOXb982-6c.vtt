00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.825
Let's walk through graphing a different linear inequality. When we graph a

00:00:03.825 --> 00:00:07.804
linear inequality we want to start by graphing a boundary line. The boundary

00:00:07.804 --> 00:00:11.788
line would be made up of the points if this inequality were an equation. I want

00:00:11.788 --> 00:00:15.756
you to use your knowledge of slope and the Y intercept to figure which of these

00:00:15.756 --> 00:00:19.235
points would be on the boundary line. Check all of them that apply.
