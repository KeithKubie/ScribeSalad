fun and so they were testing the balloon

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700
fun and so they were testing the balloon
 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.399

was secret and they also experimented
with parachuting dummies from very high

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200
with parachuting dummies from very high
 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.789
with parachuting dummies from very high
altitudes in the same area and this has

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799
altitudes in the same area and this has
 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.980
altitudes in the same area and this has
led to all these fabulous myths about

who went to area 51 to groom Lake which
 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:24.710
who went to area 51 to groom Lake which
is an Air Force Base in Nevada where we

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720
is an Air Force Base in Nevada where we
 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.910
is an Air Force Base in Nevada where we
fly around these secret airplanes and

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920
fly around these secret airplanes and
 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.649
fly around these secret airplanes and
it's a real place and these guys went

00:02:30.649 --> 00:02:30.659
it's a real place and these guys went
 

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:33.199

wouldn't talk about was how fast these

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819
wouldn't talk about was how fast these
 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:44.479

planes could go that was a big secret

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489
planes could go that was a big secret
 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:47.170
planes could go that was a big secret
but these are people that worked on the

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180
but these are people that worked on the

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:57.710
f-117a stealth fighter if you ever go to
the Air Force Museum in Ohio you can see

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720
the Air Force Museum in Ohio you can see
 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.039
the Air Force Museum in Ohio you can see
the have blue secret planes very cool I

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:01.049
the have blue secret planes very cool I
 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:04.069
the have blue secret planes very cool I
always a kid I always ask myself why

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:04.079
always a kid I always ask myself why
 

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:06.220
always a kid I always ask myself why
don't they paint spy planes light blue

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230
don't they paint spy planes light blue
 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:10.490
don't they paint spy planes light blue
to blend in with the blue sky well

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500
to blend in with the blue sky well
 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.000

sometimes they do anyway you can see one

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010
sometimes they do anyway you can see one
 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.339
sometimes they do anyway you can see one
of those there so it's a complete myth

00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:16.349
of those there so it's a complete myth
 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:19.759
of those there so it's a complete myth
that the government know just think how

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769
that the government know just think how
 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:21.530
that the government know just think how
hard it is for the government to keep

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540
hard it is for the government to keep
 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.220

government kind of sucks at keeping
 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:30.170
government kind of sucks at keeping
secrets so they couldn't possibly keep

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180
secrets so they couldn't possibly keep
 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.920
secrets so they couldn't possibly keep
the secret with ten thousand people in

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930
the secret with ten thousand people in
 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.809
the secret with ten thousand people in
on it so let's just set that aside but

00:03:37.809 --> 00:03:37.819
on it so let's just set that aside but
 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:42.170
on it so let's just set that aside but
with that said you may very well be

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180
with that said you may very well be
 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.770
with that said you may very well be
alive when we discover life or evidence

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780
alive when we discover life or evidence
 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.920
alive when we discover life or evidence
of life rather on Mars this would

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930
of life rather on Mars this would
 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.699
of life rather on Mars this would
literally be alien life if we find it if

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709
literally be alien life if we find it if
 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:54.860
literally be alien life if we find it if
we find some ancient microbes still

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870
we find some ancient microbes still
 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.470
we find some ancient microbes still
alive in some icy layer under the

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480
alive in some icy layer under the
 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.589
alive in some icy layer under the
Martian sand it would change the world

00:04:00.589 --> 00:04:00.599
Martian sand it would change the world
 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:03.170
Martian sand it would change the world
it would change the way everybody thinks

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180
it would change the way everybody thinks
 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:04.909
it would change the way everybody thinks
about being a living thing do these

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:04.919
about being a living thing do these
 

00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:06.589
about being a living thing do these
things on Mars if they exist do they

00:04:06.589 --> 00:04:06.599
things on Mars if they exist do they
 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:08.780
things on Mars if they exist do they
have DNA or did they have DNA if they've

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790
have DNA or did they have DNA if they've
 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.210
have DNA or did they have DNA if they've
been fossilized or are they a whole

nother completely type different type of
 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.129
nother completely type different type of
life that we've never thought of did

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:16.139
life that we've never thought of did
 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:17.990
life that we've never thought of did
life start on Mars Mars got hit with an

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000
life start on Mars Mars got hit with an
 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.810
life start on Mars Mars got hit with an
impact or and you and I are descended on

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820
impact or and you and I are descended on

Martians that is amazing it's it's not

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:23.729
Martians that is amazing it's it's not
 

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:25.370
Martians that is amazing it's it's not
crazy it's extraordinary but it's not

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380
crazy it's extraordinary but it's not
 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.580
crazy it's extraordinary but it's not
crazy then furthermore you may be a lot
