NATHAN ROGERS: Hi, and
welcome to Talks at Google.

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.520
My name's Nathan Rogers.

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.750
And today, I've the pleasure
of introducing one of my best

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.180
friends, Rose McAleese
to give a talk today.

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.270
So without further
ado, here is Rose.

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.360
ROSE McALEESE: Hi, my
name is Rose McAleese.

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.849
I'm a poet from
Seattle, Washington.

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:26.140
I'm just going to jump into it.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.950
You want to divorce me.

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:33.640
Fine.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.045
You wish to divorce me.

00:00:37.045 --> 00:00:41.380
[DERISIVE LAUGH] You silly crow,
wingspan too short of raven,

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:43.390
you foolish king, if
it was not for me,

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.100
you would have no hunger
for demise or conquer,

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.430
crave the flesh of another.

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:53.170
I, your lady, no chambermaid,
rest assure and barren bed

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.545
for you, sit waiting past
midnight's croning moan.

00:00:55.545 --> 00:00:59.200
Your robes are washed
daily by these hands.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.870
Stone, cold water, rinse.

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.800
Make absence of any
bloodshed, I, your wife,

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.670
clean up all your messes.

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.950
You play no judgment on such
rash decisions as these.

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.100
No marks are made in your honor.

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.600
This.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.580
Divorce?

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.410
You've wandered
too far, my dear.

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:17.430
Coward, I'm calling
you for a coward.

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.420
Coward, no hollow, no
backbone to aspire.

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.720
Where will you go, Sire?

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.790
Oh, Macbeth, such
childish quarrels as these

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.110
push us back in our demand.

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.804
Who will shine your blade?

00:01:29.804 --> 00:01:31.970
Iron the wrinkles out of
your half-hearted strategy.

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.530
It is the queen who
makes all the moves.

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.890
My scenarios unravel like chess.

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.240
And you are just a
pawn, oh my worship, you

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.450
are just a wooden pawn.

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.385
Names of former lovers
hang over the mantelpiece

00:01:46.385 --> 00:01:47.740
that is my heart.

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.184
Men, not worthy of royals.

00:01:49.184 --> 00:01:50.725
You are lucky enough
to be sacrificed

00:01:50.725 --> 00:01:53.470
as a spark in your
potential, flint

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.290
in the sense of
you being my Lord.

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.940
Now, I know the women here
back their husbands are

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.765
victim to naive, and God
smack but I-- I play shadow.

00:02:02.765 --> 00:02:05.890
I sit closely to
your heels, because I

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.770
Lady Macbeth made every
dagger a happy one.

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.990
Bash the ridiculous
notion of failure.

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.260
One must steal if
one is not given.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.100
I vow no sleep will
be lost over this.

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:24.780
And I know from experience
all bloodshed can easily

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.865
be washed away.

00:02:26.865 --> 00:02:28.800
Thanks.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:29.660
Oh, I need water.

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:30.480
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:31.920
Oh, OK.

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.390
So I like doing that one first,
because it gets the nerves out,

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:36.900
and it scares people.

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.064
So then I can win you back
over as the talk goes.

00:02:41.064 --> 00:02:43.905
So like I said, I'm
a poet, a spoken word

00:02:43.905 --> 00:02:46.010
poet from Seattle, Washington.

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.190
A little back history about
myself-- I started doing poetry

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.350
'cause when I was
in seventh grade,

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.760
I had a great teacher by
the name of Miss Chestnut.

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.610
She realized that I was
a rebel without a cause,

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.850
like I really tried to
be a bad-- I can't cuss.

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:05.080
A bad butt, but I
couldn't be, because I

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.920
was just like I had
no reason to be mad.

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.152
So, of course, when you
have no reason to be mad,

00:03:10.152 --> 00:03:12.360
and you're seven years old,
you start writing poetry.

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.350
And that's pretty much
kind of where I started,

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:17.330
and then I became a spoken
word artist slowly over time.

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.544
And then as time
progressed, I realized

00:03:19.544 --> 00:03:20.710
that I really love teaching.

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:22.510
And so I started being
a teaching artist,

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.660
which is kind of what I do now.

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:29.850
And then I guess,
almost two years ago, I

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:31.590
got my first book published.

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.375
You can like buy it now.

00:03:33.375 --> 00:03:35.300
You can buy here later,
which is exciting.

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.700
It's really weird to be like,
I have a published book.

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.380
And so, yeah, I've
just kind of been

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:44.650
a poet and everything
and whatnot.

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.950
I was super nervous about this
talk for some weird reason.

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.030
I was watching all of
the other Google talks.

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.120
And I've noticed that you know,
there's people like Tina Fey

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.570
and like Lady Gaga,
who've all been here.

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:00.160
And so it was like, oh, OK,
I'm neither of those people.

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.370
I don't know what
I'm going to do.

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.350
So my father, god bless
his soul-- he's not dead.

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:07.750
I don't know I just said that.

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:09.440
He's alive and well.

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.526
Anyway, my father told me start
talking about what you love

00:04:13.526 --> 00:04:14.650
and how passionate you are.

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:15.610
People will be
able to read that.

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:18.459
And whenever I get nervous, I'm
just going to jump into a poem.

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:21.760
So if I start doing something
or anything, just go with it.

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:22.910
OK?

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:25.160
So like I said, I'm
a teaching artist.

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.710
And the poem, I just
did was a persona poem

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:28.920
about Lady Macbeth.

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.840
I'm a huge Shakespearean nerd.

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.550
I fell in love with Shakespeare
when I was about 13 years old,

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.830
which was kind of just
disturbing to my parents.

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:37.040
But they were just like,
whatever, at least she's

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.640
reading.

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:41.810
Let her be all mournful
and semi-teenage angst,

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:43.400
depressed or whatever it was.

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:44.660
So I started doing that.

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:46.630
And then I got into
acting and realized

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:49.600
that poetry and spoken word
is basically like acting,

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.780
but you get to write
your own lines.

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:54.560
And so I started becoming
a teaching artist.

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.510
And in schools, it's really
hard to teach middle schoolers

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:59.260
and high school kids poetry.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.170
They're like what do I need to
know about a dead white guy,

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:06.730
pretty much, which is true,
but also you can make your own

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:07.920
and revamp it.

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:12.605
Thank God for people like
Jack Kerouac and Angela Davis

00:05:12.605 --> 00:05:15.230
and all these people who've kind
of like reinvented it and made

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:16.646
it their own and
everything, which

00:05:16.646 --> 00:05:18.600
is so much fun with
slam poetry because it's

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:24.740
a mixture of beatniks, hip
hop, rap and all that jazz.

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:26.930
So that poem was
written from a writing

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:28.510
prompt that I came
up with my kids,

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:31.240
where I asked them to
take a fictional character

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.850
from either movie,
a play or a book.

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:35.460
And they had to
write a monologue

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.740
to get on a reality TV show.

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:39.800
So that was Lady
Beth's monologue

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:41.455
to get on the "Bad Girls Club."

00:05:41.455 --> 00:05:43.580
I don't know if you guys
know the "Bad Girls Club,"

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:45.326
but it's a show
on Oxygen Channel.

00:05:45.326 --> 00:05:47.450
Oh my god, you need to
watch the "Bad Girls Club" !

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:50.509
It is the best
piece of feminism.

00:05:50.509 --> 00:05:51.050
Just kidding.

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:52.060
It's not.

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:53.849
Basically, they take
a bunch of girls

00:05:53.849 --> 00:05:55.890
put them in a house with
alcohol and Daddy issues

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:57.990
and just let them
roam the world.

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:59.300
And they fight each other.

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:02.650
So let's be honest, Lady Macbeth
would make it on that show,

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:05.017
and she'd be great.

00:06:05.017 --> 00:06:05.850
You should watch it.

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:08.860
It's such a great
guilty pleasure.

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:09.592
What else?

00:06:09.592 --> 00:06:11.300
So, yeah, that's one
of the pieces I did,

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:13.780
It's also in my
book, which I have.

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:14.530
I want to show it.

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:15.922
Where is it?

00:06:15.922 --> 00:06:16.630
I want to get it.

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:17.080
Sorry!

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:18.490
I should have had
my props ready.

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:19.827
I'm running offscreen.

00:06:19.827 --> 00:06:20.910
This is going to be crazy.

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:25.430
I still can't get over this.

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:28.790
Like, I first got in my house
one day, and there it was.

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:32.546
And some guy named Tom
Robbins read it and liked it.

00:06:32.546 --> 00:06:33.920
And so did Rachel
[? McKibbens ?]

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:36.990
and [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:41.750
I'm going to read one
more piece from this book.

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:47.240
I'll read a bunch of pieces,
but I really like this piece.

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:48.570
So I grew up with a very-- oh!

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:49.900
Someone walking in.

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:51.230
Hi.

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:57.680
I grew up with a very, very
Irish father, super Irish.

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:59.540
Also, a fun fact
about this book,

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:01.093
I wrote it when I was single.

00:07:04.419 --> 00:07:05.960
Can't believe that
I a boyfriend now,

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:07.376
because if you
read this book, you

00:07:07.376 --> 00:07:09.720
would be like why
would you date her?

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:13.380
So, sorry for the
guy who dates me.

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:15.820
This poem is called "Why
I Don't Write Love Poems."

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:18.510
And it starts out with a
quote from a smart man named

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:22.810
Charles McAleese, called "He
Says People are no Damn Good,

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:26.110
and Men Are Worse."

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:28.040
I've come to the
conclusion that I'm not

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:32.500
made for love, that feelings are
just tightly wound compasses,

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:35.270
trying to make it home
after a long night.

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:37.780
Romance is a store
brand laundry detergent

00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:40.190
we use to wash away our naive.

00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:42.170
Why do we love love?

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:44.720
Love clearly hates us.

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:47.040
I don't trust men who
know my middle name.

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:49.120
I don't trust men who
can charm my father

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:50.610
or drink like him either.

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:53.690
I don't trust men who smile too
big, whose best traits are all

00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:54.190
physical.

00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:57.050
I don't trust pretty
boys with nice eyes.

00:07:57.050 --> 00:07:59.580
I don't trust guys who ask,
if you can't have children,

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:01.200
why do I need to wear a condom?

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:03.680
Well, first, you
need to leave me

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:06.320
with a mouth of rusty nails
and a clinic phone number.

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:09.710
One led me to believe that I
can save fish from drowning.

00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:13.830
That man gave me a hammer and
told me to fix my own problems.

00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:17.560
White Boy called me
intimidating, too much.

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:19.700
Lover-- not the
same shade as me,

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:22.720
reassures his mother
I was just a friend.

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:26.010
Boy told me we would work out,
because he didn't want children

00:08:26.010 --> 00:08:28.500
either, because he made
sure to call me a dead end

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:29.490
before he left.

00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:30.940
There is a pattern.

00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:33.970
I love like my body, barren.

00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:37.780
Now men who say I'm too strong
need to be men about it.

00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:40.730
I mean handle your shit,
make more eye contact,

00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:42.270
speak more loudly
and clearly when

00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:43.789
you are walking away from me.

00:08:43.789 --> 00:08:46.500
I will use this as
experience to hold it

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:48.210
against the next
pretty sucker who

00:08:48.210 --> 00:08:50.390
marches his pretty
little face my way.

00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:51.940
Pray for him, birds.

00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:54.450
Let's hope that
one gets out alive.

00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:57.380
Alert the others
that I lust like war.

00:08:57.380 --> 00:09:00.950
I know how to snap next, swallow
nails, and flirt like Medusa.

00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:01.790
Be forewarned.

00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:06.010
I'm a maneater who is
developing serious hunger pains.

00:09:06.010 --> 00:09:09.390
I do not need to say
or believe a thing.

00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:11.050
You are no blacksmith.

00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:12.780
You are no lumberjack.

00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:15.070
Everything you leave
is made out of sugar.

00:09:15.070 --> 00:09:18.100
This will all crumble
with one lick.

00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:21.350
Maybe it's my fault I
wear tap shoes to bed.

00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:24.120
I like a good entrance,
and I hate silence.

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:27.750
I have a soft spot for hip bones
and I love with escape in mind.

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:30.760
Maybe it's my fault that
I care with too many keys,

00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:32.550
that I stain every
lover with rust

00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:34.500
because if I can't
be beautiful, I

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:37.930
make sure no one else
around me is either.

00:09:37.930 --> 00:09:39.670
I'm not bitter.

00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:41.740
I'm just being a man about it.

00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:44.470
No kissing, not trapping
myself in situations

00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:46.420
I can't charm my way out.

00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:48.350
I take after my mother.

00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:50.340
I'm also take after winter.

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:51.840
I'm so cold.

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:54.010
I promised to leave
quiet this time,

00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:57.190
just leave a sweaty palm
print on your door handle.

00:09:57.190 --> 00:10:01.910
Boys, how can you not love a
girl with a good exit strategy.

00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:03.350
Thank you.

00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:05.170
So yay!

00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:05.750
Cue cards!

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:06.880
Where's my cue cards?

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:09.020
I need those.

00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:12.310
So the thing I really love
about poetry in particular

00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:15.050
is that it's just such
a great way to express.

00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:17.320
Usually people always
think that like with poetry

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:20.680
it either needs to rhyme or
needs to be this or that one,

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:23.470
when in all honesty, it
can be whatever you want.

00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:25.430
It really can surely
come from anywhere

00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:27.912
of sensitive inspiration.

00:10:27.912 --> 00:10:29.870
One of the things I really
wanted to talk about

00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:33.290
is this whole concept of
digital versus analog.

00:10:33.290 --> 00:10:35.930
So me as a writer and
me as like a poet,

00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:38.620
which is kind of a dying art,
or like, people are always like,

00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:39.120
oh!

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:40.578
When they find out
I'm a poet, they

00:10:40.578 --> 00:10:42.340
ask me like three questions.

00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:45.450
First one is where
can I read your stuff?

00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:46.730
I hate that question.

00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:48.730
Because this was like
before I became published.

00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:52.510
I was just like you're going
to hear it at a poetry slam.

00:10:52.510 --> 00:10:55.532
And then the second one
is why are you a poet,

00:10:55.532 --> 00:10:57.240
which I don't think
I need to explain it.

00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:58.490
It just kind of happened.

00:10:58.490 --> 00:11:00.220
And then the third
and final one is, so

00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:01.730
what do you do for money?

00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:02.230
Right?

00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:07.454
So I realized that that's like
a really difficult thing to do.

00:11:07.454 --> 00:11:08.120
Let's be honest.

00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:09.220
We all want money.

00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:11.610
We all want to get paid
for our art and everything.

00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:13.700
But it's a sacrifice
that you make,

00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:15.862
because you just love doing it.

00:11:15.862 --> 00:11:17.990
So, as a writer,
I always am told

00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:19.990
that I am like a crazy
person, because I

00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:23.700
have to physically
write down every poem.

00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:25.830
I can't just type it.

00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:30.520
I have a very, very severe
and special form of dyslexia,

00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:34.380
where I can't see vowels at all.

00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:37.010
It's a very strange
form of dyslexia.

00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:37.740
It's very rare.

00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:42.500
So for me, when I write, it's
kind in this special language

00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:43.985
that no one else
can really read,

00:11:43.985 --> 00:11:45.360
because it's all
chicken scratch.

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:47.020
And like there's no
vowels in my words

00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:49.970
pretty much, which I
used to worry about,

00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:52.410
like so people are always
like why do you keep a diary?

00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:53.377
What if you lose it?

00:11:53.377 --> 00:11:54.960
It's like good luck
trying to read it.

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:56.500
There's that episode of Doug.

00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:58.541
I don't know if anyone
remembers that show, Doug,

00:11:58.541 --> 00:12:00.460
where Doug loses his journal.

00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:02.700
And his arch nemesis,
Roger finds i.

00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:04.799
And he's worried that
Roger's going to read it.

00:12:04.799 --> 00:12:06.090
And Roger gives it back to him.

00:12:06.090 --> 00:12:07.270
And he's like it's
chicken scratch.

00:12:07.270 --> 00:12:08.570
You're able to read this.

00:12:08.570 --> 00:12:12.320
And it's like, ah man, that just
made me feel so much better.

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:14.080
So for me, it's all
about the concept

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:16.410
that, like, when you're
stuck in a situation

00:12:16.410 --> 00:12:18.420
or you find yourself in
front of the computer,

00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:20.170
I always find myself
procrastinating more.

00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:23.676
Like I find myself
so highly distracted

00:12:23.676 --> 00:12:24.800
by everything and anything.

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:26.170
You know, all of a
sudden, I'm on Twitter.

00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:27.545
All of a sudden,
I'm on Facebook.

00:12:27.545 --> 00:12:29.882
All of a sudden, I'm
googling myself, whatever.

00:12:29.882 --> 00:12:31.340
But when you have
a piece of paper,

00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:33.780
you just kind of
forget how epically

00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:38.560
organic that is, to literally
see the word on the page, just

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:41.940
pressed and archived for
your own personal advantage.

00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:43.880
And I realize in
this day and age,

00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:46.734
why keep a journal if no
one's going to read it.

00:12:46.734 --> 00:12:48.400
But that's the thing
is you need to keep

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:50.000
a journal because no
one's going to read it.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.340
I know this is like the
generation where you literally

00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:54.440
put up, like, I had
the best tuna fish

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:56.670
sandwich ever on Twitter, right?

00:12:56.670 --> 00:12:59.190
But not everyone
needs to know that.

00:12:59.190 --> 00:13:01.150
I'm sorry, that stuff
always bothers me.

00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:03.500
You need to tell people I'm
going to talk at Google.

00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:06.310
That's the stuff they
like on Facebook.

00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:07.900
But so my whole
thing is that you

00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:10.930
have to go back to the page.

00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:12.560
It's really difficult
and really hard.

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:15.800
And as a poet, you
go back to the page,

00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:18.900
and then you kind of bring
it back to the stage.

00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:23.670
That was so cheesy,
but really epic.

00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:25.820
So with that I'll
give you another poem.

00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:26.320
See?

00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:28.530
I got all nervous, and then
I'm going to do a poem.

00:13:28.530 --> 00:13:30.405
And then I'm not going
to be nervous anymore.

00:13:30.405 --> 00:13:31.550
It's going great.

00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:33.700
This is a good
choice of an outfit.

00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:36.020
I went through like three
different choices today.

00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:38.520
And I just think this one's
really epic and awesome.

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:40.400
[? Uniglo, ?] you
should do my wardrobe.

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:42.050
That was a really bad shout out.

00:13:42.050 --> 00:13:42.880
That was fun.

00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:43.565
Here's a poem.

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:52.190
One in a million.

00:13:52.190 --> 00:13:55.290
That's how many people have your
reading disability, Roseanne.

00:13:55.290 --> 00:13:57.832
One in a million.

00:13:57.832 --> 00:13:59.540
That's what the
well-paid doctor told me.

00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:03.650
But don't worry, he
said, you're not alone.

00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:04.380
Wait, hold up.

00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:07.707
One in a million
and I'm not alone?

00:14:07.707 --> 00:14:09.290
That make as much
sense as this mumble

00:14:09.290 --> 00:14:10.620
jumble they call an alphabet.

00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:14.180
A-E-I-O-U and sometimes Y. See?

00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:16.400
I didn't know these
letters were special,

00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:19.620
and that these letters were
going to make me special.

00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:21.797
But I can't recognize vowels.

00:14:21.797 --> 00:14:24.380
And those little perks like to
play word games up, down, left,

00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:26.463
right, vertical, cross the
page, like chess pieces

00:14:26.463 --> 00:14:27.920
in a never-ending board game.

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:28.850
See, I don't know
what you learned.

00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:31.030
But I learned E came before
I. If it didn't, then

00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:37.540
they should have rearranged the
alphabet as I E F G T K X 7 4.

00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:38.170
Ah, screw it.

00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:40.400
You got me memorizing that
thing, like it's worth it.

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:42.820
I think spelling
altogether is preposterous.

00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:43.710
Preposterous.

00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:47.300
P-O-S-T-E-Z-R-N. Preposterous.

00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:49.640
OK, so maybe my
spelling's a little off.

00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:51.500
But have you ever
studied English spelling?

00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:53.118
I mean, take the
word drunkenness.

00:14:53.118 --> 00:14:54.076
D-R-U-N-K-E-N-N-E-S-S-.

00:14:57.350 --> 00:14:59.630
A drunk came up
with the spelling.

00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:02.330
I know this, because A, there's
not enough thought put into it,

00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:04.110
and B, there's too many Ns.

00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:07.230
And well, drunks never
know when to end.

00:15:07.230 --> 00:15:09.870
There's an L in salmon.

00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:11.730
Why the hell is
there an L in salmon?

00:15:11.730 --> 00:15:13.480
Now you got my ears
[INAUDIBLE] riverbeds,

00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:15.102
trying to hear that salmon.

00:15:15.102 --> 00:15:16.560
And all I'm doing
is hitting walls.

00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:18.180
And all I got to
say for it is damn.

00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:21.495
A-E-I-O-U and sometimes
I ask myself Y.

00:15:21.495 --> 00:15:24.910
See, bullies used to hold books
over my head yelling spell

00:15:24.910 --> 00:15:25.410
it, Rose.

00:15:25.410 --> 00:15:26.650
Spell it and you'll get it.

00:15:26.650 --> 00:15:29.840
I was put in exile ever
from going near a library.

00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:31.790
First, I blamed in on my pencil.

00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:35.020
It seemed to be holding
everyone else's words just fine.

00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:38.490
I cursed each one I picked
up, spelling it wrong again

00:15:38.490 --> 00:15:40.690
and again and again.

00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:44.010
Until the paper was nothing
but pinks marks and my eraser

00:15:44.010 --> 00:15:47.460
had crumbled down like a
watered-down tumbleweed.

00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:51.230
See, the brain is
like a window sill.

00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:55.290
Outside, stage left,
there's an apple tree.

00:15:55.290 --> 00:15:57.200
Replace those
apples with letters.

00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:58.950
And when someone
approaches you and asks

00:15:58.950 --> 00:16:02.080
you to spell something, you
can reach outside your window,

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:04.400
grab the letters
needed, and then look,

00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:05.950
you have the word predictable.

00:16:05.950 --> 00:16:08.300
Well, aren't you so smart.

00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:14.130
See, my window is a lot
smaller and really dirty.

00:16:14.130 --> 00:16:17.040
And my apple tree is
kind of dying and wilted

00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:18.400
in the distance.

00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:20.260
So when I do reach
for letters, I

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:23.440
bring up nothing but
sawdust and paint chips.

00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:24.611
So do it.

00:16:24.611 --> 00:16:26.110
Prick me again with
one of those Ns,

00:16:26.110 --> 00:16:27.700
let me pour lemon
juice in my wounds.

00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:28.835
Watch me shrivel
up like a slug I

00:16:28.835 --> 00:16:30.220
used to torture on
boring summer day.

00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:31.900
And when September
comes, I am nothing

00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:33.800
but a ghostwriter
writing in invisible ink.

00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:35.620
See my writing was fine.

00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:37.650
The spelling was
being held against me.

00:16:37.650 --> 00:16:39.790
I had great placements
for nouns, adverbs,

00:16:39.790 --> 00:16:41.620
and I can braise
some veal-- I got

00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:43.740
elegant adjective-- with ease.

00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:46.440
I filled with tears
inside in spelling bee.

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:48.240
And this is my
apology to anyone who

00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:50.300
says I can't be a poet because
I don't know how to spell.

00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:50.830
Well, guess what?

00:16:50.830 --> 00:16:51.370
You're wrong.

00:16:51.370 --> 00:16:53.120
Because not only do I
write, I was a spit.

00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:55.850
And I spit nothing but fire,
so call yourself cremated.

00:16:55.850 --> 00:16:58.230
Yes, I do have my obstacles.

00:16:58.230 --> 00:17:03.670
A-E-I-O-U, and sometimes
even Y. But as you can see,

00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:05.049
they haven't stopped me yet.

00:17:05.049 --> 00:17:05.596
Thank you.

00:17:05.596 --> 00:17:06.429
AUDIENCE: [APPLAUSE]

00:17:06.429 --> 00:17:07.810
ROSE McALEESE: Whoo!

00:17:07.810 --> 00:17:10.839
She goes off stage!

00:17:10.839 --> 00:17:14.970
Wait, I have props.

00:17:14.970 --> 00:17:16.680
I'm going to do a magic trick.

00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:18.430
Can I come from the--
oh, I can't come up!

00:17:18.430 --> 00:17:19.555
I was going to try come up.

00:17:19.555 --> 00:17:21.410
This is Pippo.

00:17:21.410 --> 00:17:24.400
He's famous.

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:25.020
Ah, man.

00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:25.780
He's drunk.

00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:27.270
He's a little drunk monkey.

00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:31.370
I got Pippo when I
was three years old.

00:17:31.370 --> 00:17:34.420
Him and I have the same
birthday, which is Halloween.

00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:38.550
And he's, like, literally
my most prized possession,

00:17:38.550 --> 00:17:41.930
which is so weird
for most people.

00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:44.050
But he's the man.

00:17:44.050 --> 00:17:47.690
He has to share a bed with me.

00:17:47.690 --> 00:17:48.450
And he's awesome.

00:17:48.450 --> 00:17:50.200
But the reason why I'm
talking about Pippo

00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:52.020
is because-- so
this whole concept

00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:53.360
of going back to the notebooks.

00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:57.000
So I always have a notebook
with me, like everywhere I go.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:02.160
Every jacket of mine has a
little tiny notebook and a pen.

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:04.790
I can't be somewhere
if I can't write.

00:18:04.790 --> 00:18:09.520
You see artists all
the time that they're

00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:11.290
doing imprints or
drawing or whatever

00:18:11.290 --> 00:18:13.593
on a napkin or the
back of a ticket stub.

00:18:13.593 --> 00:18:15.090
I'm that way.

00:18:15.090 --> 00:18:18.700
I literally have millions and
millions of these notebooks.

00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:21.770
And most notebooks
represent about six months.

00:18:21.770 --> 00:18:25.050
And then I move on to the next
one and so on and so forth.

00:18:25.050 --> 00:18:27.420
So one of the things
that I basically

00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:28.889
wanted to have
this talk about is

00:18:28.889 --> 00:18:30.930
that like when you're
stuck in a situation that's

00:18:30.930 --> 00:18:34.400
extremely difficult
with dealing with life,

00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:37.690
it's always good to go back to
the page and writing it out.

00:18:37.690 --> 00:18:40.495
And one of my favorite things
to do is write out lists.

00:18:40.495 --> 00:18:42.370
So I'm going to read
you guys some of my list

00:18:42.370 --> 00:18:44.700
from my notebook, which
is kind of like not

00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:47.090
my point, because my point is
to keep it in the notebook.

00:18:47.090 --> 00:18:49.570
But let's just pretend you
guys are in my bedroom.

00:18:49.570 --> 00:18:52.470
And I practiced this Google
Talk in my bedroom one too

00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:53.020
many times.

00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:55.500
He had to listen to it.

00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:57.960
So these are things that
I believe to be true.

00:18:57.960 --> 00:18:58.850
OK?

00:18:58.850 --> 00:19:01.340
Pigeons don't die.

00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:04.000
Has anyone seen a baby pigeon?

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:04.770
Exactly.

00:19:04.770 --> 00:19:05.620
They don't die.

00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:09.120
Pigeons have been here
since the beginning.

00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:11.519
I also believe that I was
going to marry Sam Cooke.

00:19:11.519 --> 00:19:12.560
Then I found out he died.

00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:14.580
And then I told my mom I
was going to marry my dad.

00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:16.579
And my mom was like [SNORT]
good luck with that.

00:19:16.579 --> 00:19:17.800
So that's bad.

00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:20.530
I think spelling is stupid.

00:19:20.530 --> 00:19:22.830
The best moments are
never caught on film.

00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:24.600
I met Dave Chapelle once.

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:27.882
No one believes me, because
I didn't Instagram it.

00:19:27.882 --> 00:19:29.340
I think "Clueless"
and "Mean Girls"

00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:31.920
are the funniest movies ever.

00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:34.170
You cannot debate me on that.

00:19:34.170 --> 00:19:34.990
I'm sorry.

00:19:34.990 --> 00:19:37.610
I've had many arguments
with friends being like, no.

00:19:37.610 --> 00:19:39.460
"Clueless" and "Mean Girls."

00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:40.970
On Wednesdays, we wear pink.

00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:41.840
Is today Wednesday?

00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:42.420
No, it's not.

00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:43.620
OK, never mind.

00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:46.690
I also think that
Beyonce is a unicorn.

00:19:46.690 --> 00:19:47.870
She's amazing.

00:19:47.870 --> 00:19:49.510
I also believe that
writing things down

00:19:49.510 --> 00:19:51.280
is better than typing them out.

00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:53.550
I also believe that
the power of good art

00:19:53.550 --> 00:19:55.880
and the power of bad art.

00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:57.000
Here's my bucket list.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.050
First of all, I hate
the word bucket list.

00:19:59.050 --> 00:20:01.280
It just sounds so
stupid and dirty.

00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:03.010
Like bucket is just
a dirty word to me.

00:20:03.010 --> 00:20:06.474
So this is my to do list,
which sounds even dirtier, now

00:20:06.474 --> 00:20:07.140
that you say it.

00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:08.040
Like, "to do."

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:08.840
Anyways.

00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:12.270
So this is what I want
to do for my to-do list.

00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:15.120
I'd like to move out
of my roommate's house.

00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:18.770
Fun fact, since I am a poet, I
live with this elderly couple.

00:20:18.770 --> 00:20:20.270
They're great.

00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:21.970
I call them Mom and Dad.

00:20:21.970 --> 00:20:22.670
They're nice.

00:20:22.670 --> 00:20:24.878
They're not freaked out that
I call them Mom and Dad,

00:20:24.878 --> 00:20:27.250
because I'm been calling
them that my whole life.

00:20:27.250 --> 00:20:27.850
Anyways.

00:20:27.850 --> 00:20:28.590
OK.

00:20:28.590 --> 00:20:30.670
I would like to
write a screenplay.

00:20:30.670 --> 00:20:32.870
I would also like to find
out what Bill Murray says

00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:35.370
at the end of "Lost
in Translation"

00:20:35.370 --> 00:20:37.670
to Scarlett Johannsen.

00:20:37.670 --> 00:20:41.170
I would like to find the
perfect voice for Pippo.

00:20:41.170 --> 00:20:44.470
I want to do like a Lifetime
web series of just my life,

00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:46.680
because I think I'm cool enough.

00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:47.860
And Pippo needs a voice.

00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:48.860
But I don't know
what he sounds like,

00:20:48.860 --> 00:20:49.490
so I'm up for suggestions.

00:20:49.490 --> 00:20:51.240
You can look at him
and examine him.

00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:53.530
I think British, but I'm Irish.

00:20:53.530 --> 00:20:55.549
So why are you British?

00:20:55.549 --> 00:20:56.090
I don't know.

00:20:56.090 --> 00:20:57.715
So if you can think
of a name for him--

00:20:57.715 --> 00:21:00.720
I actually want to listen
to Dr. Dre's "Detox."

00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:01.470
It's like Beyonce.

00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:02.280
It's a unicorn.

00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:04.290
I don't know if it's
actually going to come out.

00:21:04.290 --> 00:21:08.330
I want to befriend a girl
named Becky really badly,

00:21:08.330 --> 00:21:11.140
so I can be like "Becky,
look at her butt."

00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:14.250
I also want to
find a baby pigeon.

00:21:14.250 --> 00:21:15.900
I want to be on "SNL."

00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:17.970
So here's my "SNL"
moment, you guys.

00:21:17.970 --> 00:21:19.760
I'm going to use
this Google Talk.

00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:23.110
Lorne Michaels, if you're
out there, or Maya Rudolph,

00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:24.540
I really want to be on "SNL."

00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:26.320
Like, it kind of
disgusting how badly

00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:27.510
I want to be on this show.

00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:31.295
So I realize in my "SNL"
-like working things out,

00:21:31.295 --> 00:21:32.920
there are two types
of people in "SNL."

00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:34.940
This all has to
do with something.

00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:37.380
OK, I promise this will have
a good conclusion at the end.

00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:37.950
I hope.

00:21:37.950 --> 00:21:40.210
Anyways, two things
about "SNL" people.

00:21:40.210 --> 00:21:41.619
You're either a
character person,

00:21:41.619 --> 00:21:43.660
where you make up new
characters, like the Target

00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:45.550
Lady or Debbie Downer, all that.

00:21:45.550 --> 00:21:48.490
Or you're someone
who does impressions.

00:21:48.490 --> 00:21:50.850
I don't think I
can do impressions.

00:21:50.850 --> 00:21:52.930
But I have two impressions!

00:21:52.930 --> 00:21:55.120
Can I test them out
for you on you guys?

00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:56.550
Can I?

00:21:56.550 --> 00:21:58.870
There are people in this
audience, I promise, YouTube.

00:21:58.870 --> 00:22:00.730
OK, so here's my
two impressions.

00:22:00.730 --> 00:22:01.230
OK?

00:22:01.230 --> 00:22:04.430
So, Obama.

00:22:04.430 --> 00:22:06.785
[EXHALES] I'm going to get here.

00:22:06.785 --> 00:22:09.160
(DEEP VOICE) Sasha,
Malia, go to bed.

00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:09.910
(NORMAL VOICE) OK.

00:22:09.910 --> 00:22:12.429
Now here's my Yogi
Bear impression.

00:22:12.429 --> 00:22:13.970
(DEEP VOICE) Sasha,
Malia, go to bed.

00:22:13.970 --> 00:22:14.803
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:22:14.803 --> 00:22:16.590
ROSE McALEESE: They're
the same person!

00:22:16.590 --> 00:22:17.897
Anyways, OK.

00:22:17.897 --> 00:22:19.230
Sorry, that was my "SNL" moment.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.050
Also, moving on.

00:22:24.050 --> 00:22:28.100
So basically I'm working on
like nine different projects

00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:31.070
right now that have nothing
to do with my art, which

00:22:31.070 --> 00:22:33.061
really bums me out and
really makes me sad,

00:22:33.061 --> 00:22:34.560
because I actually
have to do things

00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:40.460
that I will pay my nonrent
to my nonroommates.

00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:43.800
But every time I make a list,
I always feel like I'm writing,

00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:47.030
that I'm an actual writer, that
I'm actually doing something

00:22:47.030 --> 00:22:49.485
that matters, because
it impresses myself

00:22:49.485 --> 00:22:51.770
and it impresses Pippo,
and at the end of the day,

00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:53.590
it makes me happy.

00:22:53.590 --> 00:22:57.100
So one of the last lists
I wrote is things I hate.

00:22:57.100 --> 00:23:02.305
Dentists, bananas, snow,
split sinks-- you know,

00:23:02.305 --> 00:23:03.930
when they have one
faucet for hot water

00:23:03.930 --> 00:23:05.179
and one faucet for cold water.

00:23:05.179 --> 00:23:05.740
I hate that.

00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:08.060
Which one do you use?

00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:11.050
Being told that I'm too much,
too passionate, too churned-up,

00:23:11.050 --> 00:23:12.350
or too excited.

00:23:12.350 --> 00:23:13.840
I hate flying.

00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:16.190
I hate how easily
stressed I get.

00:23:16.190 --> 00:23:20.340
I hate how no one experiences
paper cuts anymore,

00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:24.206
because in this digital age,
no one reads books that often.

00:23:24.206 --> 00:23:25.080
You know what I mean?

00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:26.370
It's always on something.

00:23:26.370 --> 00:23:27.810
This is the
generation-- actually,

00:23:27.810 --> 00:23:29.830
you know what, that's
actually a good thing.

00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:32.520
Why am I hating off a paper--
no one wants paper clips.

00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:35.070
I think Google saved the paper
clip, if you think about it.

00:23:35.070 --> 00:23:36.240
The paper cut, I mean.

00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:37.823
Like you don't get
paper cuts anymore.

00:23:37.823 --> 00:23:39.755
You just Google search things.

00:23:39.755 --> 00:23:42.970
And I also hate buffering
on like Hulu videos.

00:23:42.970 --> 00:23:45.320
Can someone fix that?

00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:46.320
No one?

00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:47.170
OK, never mind.

00:23:47.170 --> 00:23:50.300
Anyways, so
basically my point is

00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:54.790
just that when everything
comes down to it,

00:23:54.790 --> 00:23:56.860
the paper and the
pen are literally

00:23:56.860 --> 00:23:59.380
the most mightiest
things in the world.

00:23:59.380 --> 00:24:03.270
I am in this really weird
purgatory stage in my life

00:24:03.270 --> 00:24:05.640
where I don't know
exactly what I'm doing.

00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:08.440
Like I can't even believe
that I'm here right now.

00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:12.110
But I think it just has to do
with I literally write letters

00:24:12.110 --> 00:24:13.030
to the universe.

00:24:13.030 --> 00:24:15.610
And then I just kind of press
it together in my notebook

00:24:15.610 --> 00:24:19.920
and hope that someday, someone
reads it, if not in the cosmos

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:20.930
or whatever.

00:24:20.930 --> 00:24:24.490
So it's just like go
back to actual writing.

00:24:24.490 --> 00:24:26.970
I mean picking up a pen
is such a heavy act,

00:24:26.970 --> 00:24:30.670
but it does so much.

00:24:30.670 --> 00:24:32.270
So now I'm nervous again.

00:24:32.270 --> 00:24:33.830
So I'm going to do another poem.

00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:35.810
This is easy.

00:24:35.810 --> 00:24:38.134
Rappers don't really talk
between their songs, do they?

00:24:38.134 --> 00:24:39.800
They just kind of go
into the next song.

00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:41.250
They're horrible
public speakers.

00:24:41.250 --> 00:24:43.124
I think rappers are
horrible public speakers.

00:24:43.124 --> 00:24:45.577
That's a secret.

00:24:45.577 --> 00:24:47.160
But then again, I
want to be a rapper.

00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:50.510
I already have four
rap names-- Rose Gold,

00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:53.820
Rosetta Stone, and
Rose Bowl, which

00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:55.900
is like if I ever become
like a high rapper.

00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:56.890
But I don't smoke weed.

00:24:56.890 --> 00:24:59.420
So, never mind.

00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:01.220
More poems.

00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:10.730
[EXHALES]

00:25:10.730 --> 00:25:14.730
James Brown steps on stage.

00:25:14.730 --> 00:25:18.270
He is carved from
midnight's marble.

00:25:18.270 --> 00:25:22.540
He turns to his right hand
man, Clyde Funky Drummer

00:25:22.540 --> 00:25:25.675
Stubblefield and says, kick
a little, Clemen-clyde.

00:25:25.675 --> 00:25:29.490
Clyde, bursting from
his love and joy, all

00:25:29.490 --> 00:25:33.580
that is rhythm and blues,
beats the drums with such ease

00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:38.580
like God told him to play like
he was God playing the drums.

00:25:38.580 --> 00:25:41.900
The sound that came out
was pure, cold sweat.

00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:42.780
It's flesh.

00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:44.920
We're naked around the arena.

00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:46.862
A classic in the making.

00:25:46.862 --> 00:25:48.320
The record skips,
the record skips,

00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:51.930
the record skips a few years,
and hip hop shows up late

00:25:51.930 --> 00:25:53.880
but looks good.

00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:56.034
Does not make eye contact
with anyone in the room,

00:25:56.034 --> 00:25:57.200
afraid someone might notice.

00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:58.320
Um, excuse me.

00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:00.490
They're not from
around these parts.

00:26:00.490 --> 00:26:03.090
See hip hop was given
all the hand-me-downs,

00:26:03.090 --> 00:26:05.460
but learned to put swag
back in their stitches.

00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:07.870
Took what's not theirs
and made it their own.

00:26:07.870 --> 00:26:10.300
See, everything was
fine, until someone

00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:12.610
noticed the similarities
there once was.

00:26:12.610 --> 00:26:13.260
Hip hop.

00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:15.440
You kicked a little too
much dust off those records.

00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:18.950
Even Midas knows the price
you got to pay for the touch.

00:26:18.950 --> 00:26:21.810
The samples are not free.

00:26:21.810 --> 00:26:24.350
I would worry if I were
you, Mr. Biz Markie.

00:26:24.350 --> 00:26:28.840
In 2004, Brian Burton took the
JZ Black Album and the Beatles

00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:31.710
White Album and
made the Grey album.

00:26:31.710 --> 00:26:36.080
EMI, record companies, all of
a sudden feeling very cheated,

00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:38.860
decides to sue this nobody
for all that he's worth.

00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:41.710
This plan backfires, and
they pulled this lover,

00:26:41.710 --> 00:26:44.380
this fan of pure music
into the limelight for all

00:26:44.380 --> 00:26:46.280
to love and admire.

00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:50.760
The Beatles, angry about all
that has taken from them,

00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:53.260
have a song called
"Revolution #9"

00:26:53.260 --> 00:26:55.720
which is nine minutes of
remix, remix, remix, mastered

00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:56.680
in sounds.

00:26:56.680 --> 00:27:01.470
Andy Warhol can paint someone
else's photos and call it art.

00:27:01.470 --> 00:27:03.910
He even took a soup
can to stop himself

00:27:03.910 --> 00:27:06.370
from being a starving artist.

00:27:06.370 --> 00:27:10.510
Shakespeare took the framework
of a tragic Italian love story

00:27:10.510 --> 00:27:12.800
and slapped his name on it.

00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:16.680
Disney had the audacity to take
you your loved fairy tales,

00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:19.670
add some colors, re-animate
them, and walk to the bank,

00:27:19.670 --> 00:27:21.660
because well, this
generation know

00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:23.600
the best artists do not copy.

00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:24.780
They steal.

00:27:24.780 --> 00:27:27.800
And history is nothing
more than a 12-year boy

00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:30.180
with a serious (MOCK
STUTTER) stuttering problem,

00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:32.300
who's been told
one too many times

00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:34.350
to learn from your mistakes.

00:27:34.350 --> 00:27:38.206
It is one thing to pull
from your inspiration.

00:27:38.206 --> 00:27:42.190
It is another thing to be
the Man's tracing paper.

00:27:42.190 --> 00:27:47.610
As poets, as writers,
no, as humans, as humans,

00:27:47.610 --> 00:27:49.190
we sample all the time.

00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:50.840
Sample like ribcage.

00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:52.510
Advice your
grandmother once gave

00:27:52.510 --> 00:27:53.690
you are the weight of Atlas.

00:27:53.690 --> 00:27:54.760
Nothing is holy.

00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:55.570
Nothing is sacred.

00:27:55.570 --> 00:27:59.500
However, she'll be recognized
and respected and thanked.

00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:02.170
This evening, class,
Funky Drummer Stubblefield

00:28:02.170 --> 00:28:05.370
is doing me an honor of playing
my outro, a sample of all

00:28:05.370 --> 00:28:07.650
my favorite Kanye
West-- oop, sorry.

00:28:07.650 --> 00:28:10.050
Pardon me-- Frankenstein tunes.

00:28:10.050 --> 00:28:12.560
Clyde, whose own
original sound has

00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:17.460
been copied on 100 different
songs, has yet to see a penny.

00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:20.850
But for the record, he
wants nothing in return

00:28:20.850 --> 00:28:23.715
but a simple thank you.

00:28:23.715 --> 00:28:28.615
AUDIENCE: [APPLAUSE]

00:28:28.615 --> 00:28:29.990
ROSE McALEESE:
Shake that monkey.

00:28:29.990 --> 00:28:30.630
That was inappropriate.

00:28:30.630 --> 00:28:31.425
Never mind.

00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:39.810
Anyway, so yeah, being a writer.

00:28:39.810 --> 00:28:40.550
It's fun.

00:28:40.550 --> 00:28:42.800
It's interesting.

00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:46.080
It's been a very interesting
process, especially

00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:48.890
with becoming a teaching artist.

00:28:48.890 --> 00:28:50.210
I was horrible in school.

00:28:50.210 --> 00:28:51.780
I absolutely hated school.

00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:54.489
It was really difficult
for me, because I

00:28:54.489 --> 00:28:55.530
had a reading disability.

00:28:55.530 --> 00:28:58.140
And instead of trying
to actually have someone

00:28:58.140 --> 00:29:00.575
to pull me aside, and
explain to me what happened,

00:29:00.575 --> 00:29:01.950
they just threw
me in special ed,

00:29:01.950 --> 00:29:04.600
and were just like we're going
to just-- she sinks or swims,

00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:05.770
pretty much.

00:29:05.770 --> 00:29:08.010
So I've been going
back into schools

00:29:08.010 --> 00:29:11.890
and trying to help people
realize that everyone's special

00:29:11.890 --> 00:29:13.930
and everyone's unique
in their own way.

00:29:13.930 --> 00:29:15.970
And one of the writing
exercises that I

00:29:15.970 --> 00:29:18.460
do with my kids,
first-off, is I tell

00:29:18.460 --> 00:29:20.250
them to write a Pinky List.

00:29:20.250 --> 00:29:22.370
And a Pinky List
is a list of things

00:29:22.370 --> 00:29:26.352
that make you different
than the next person.

00:29:26.352 --> 00:29:27.810
So, for instance,
on my Pinky List,

00:29:27.810 --> 00:29:30.270
I would say like I'm
born on Halloween.

00:29:30.270 --> 00:29:32.760
I have a fear of bananas.

00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:35.530
My socks never match.

00:29:35.530 --> 00:29:37.934
And just all the weird stuff.

00:29:37.934 --> 00:29:39.600
There's so many-- why
can't I think of a

00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:41.440
in single weird thing
about me right now.

00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:43.460
But yeah, so basically,
one of things I do

00:29:43.460 --> 00:29:46.320
is do a Pinky List, which
is a great writing exercise.

00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:47.480
I love lists.

00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:49.320
I think that they
literally break down

00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:53.910
any situation or any problem you
have or face in everyday life.

00:29:53.910 --> 00:29:55.510
And I guess in this
whole thing that I

00:29:55.510 --> 00:29:58.490
want you guys to walk away
with is to just write.

00:29:58.490 --> 00:30:03.010
Journal out just to basically
just leave it on the page.

00:30:03.010 --> 00:30:04.660
I mean, I can't
stress that enough.

00:30:04.660 --> 00:30:10.080
It's just so epically
awesome, and it's really hard

00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:12.100
to just leave in your head.

00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:12.820
It just hurts.

00:30:12.820 --> 00:30:13.530
It really does.

00:30:13.530 --> 00:30:16.530
You just have to put it on
the page and figure it out.

00:30:16.530 --> 00:30:18.070
I also would like
to give you guys

00:30:18.070 --> 00:30:21.430
some writing prompts,
because I'm big on that.

00:30:21.430 --> 00:30:23.150
So one of them is to
make a Pinky List.

00:30:23.150 --> 00:30:24.890
You guys have
homework, and you're

00:30:24.890 --> 00:30:28.340
going to have to submit it to
me on Twitter in 140 characters

00:30:28.340 --> 00:30:29.400
or less.

00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:32.050
So one of the ones I
have is the Pinky List.

00:30:32.050 --> 00:30:36.190
Another one that I have,
one of y favorite writing

00:30:36.190 --> 00:30:38.160
prompts that I do with
my high school kids

00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:41.080
is "Things My Ex
Would Have Said."

00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:41.889
They love that one.

00:30:41.889 --> 00:30:42.430
I don't know.

00:30:42.430 --> 00:30:44.990
But kids are-- they love
the anti-love poems.

00:30:44.990 --> 00:30:48.060
Like screw you,
Dante or whatever.

00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:52.160
Then the other one is "Tell
Me About the Ride Home," which

00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:55.130
actually I kind of stole that
from a famous hero of mine,

00:30:55.130 --> 00:30:58.250
Seamus Heaney, RIP.

00:30:58.250 --> 00:31:00.550
And so, yeah, that's
some writing prompts.

00:31:00.550 --> 00:31:01.550
So you guys can go with.

00:31:01.550 --> 00:31:02.940
So I'm going to
do one more poem.

00:31:02.940 --> 00:31:05.150
And then you guys
are free to go back

00:31:05.150 --> 00:31:08.060
to your awesome Googleness.

00:31:08.060 --> 00:31:10.170
By the way, I have a
question about Google.

00:31:10.170 --> 00:31:14.596
When you are like on the
interweb, are you Google-able?

00:31:14.596 --> 00:31:15.970
Like I tell people
this all time,

00:31:15.970 --> 00:31:17.803
like, oh, they're like
where can I find you?

00:31:17.803 --> 00:31:19.400
And I'm like, oh,
I'm Google-able.

00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:20.570
That's not a good word.

00:31:20.570 --> 00:31:23.750
You guys have got to think of
something else to think of.

00:31:23.750 --> 00:31:24.250
OK.

00:31:24.250 --> 00:31:25.150
AUDIENCE: Google me.

00:31:25.150 --> 00:31:25.900
ROSE McALEESE: Oh!

00:31:25.900 --> 00:31:26.590
Google me.

00:31:26.590 --> 00:31:27.870
That's stupid.

00:31:27.870 --> 00:31:29.420
Why didn't I just think of that?

00:31:29.420 --> 00:31:33.670
Someone make a
hashtag of Google me.

00:31:33.670 --> 00:31:35.610
That was a dumb question.

00:31:35.610 --> 00:31:36.110
OK.

00:31:36.110 --> 00:31:38.090
This is it.

00:31:38.090 --> 00:31:40.340
I'm going to take
up a lot of space.

00:31:40.340 --> 00:31:42.140
So thank you for coming.

00:31:42.140 --> 00:31:44.817
This is a huge honor
and not as scary

00:31:44.817 --> 00:31:46.150
as I thought it was going to be.

00:31:46.150 --> 00:31:47.164
This has been fun.

00:31:47.164 --> 00:31:48.330
I hope you enjoyed yourself.

00:31:48.330 --> 00:31:49.480
If not, lie to me.

00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:50.010
OK?

00:31:50.010 --> 00:31:50.510
Thanks.

00:32:00.573 --> 00:32:02.311
What is the first
line of this poem?

00:32:02.311 --> 00:32:04.060
See, this is the other
thing about poetry.

00:32:04.060 --> 00:32:05.930
It does not need to be
perfect and crafted,

00:32:05.930 --> 00:32:09.510
and sound like you went
to college to write it.

00:32:09.510 --> 00:32:12.230
Because I didn't go to college.

00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:13.570
School of Hard Knocks.

00:32:13.570 --> 00:32:14.355
Anyway, OK.

00:32:14.355 --> 00:32:15.924
I should do a football tag.

00:32:15.924 --> 00:32:16.590
What do they do?

00:32:16.590 --> 00:32:19.030
They say their name and
whatever school they went to.

00:32:19.030 --> 00:32:20.446
I'm going to do
that. (DEEP VOICE)

00:32:20.446 --> 00:32:23.740
Rose McAleese, School of
Hard Knocks, Sea Hawks.

00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:25.010
I shouldn't say that.

00:32:25.010 --> 00:32:26.300
We're in San Francisco.

00:32:26.300 --> 00:32:27.270
Not San Francisco.

00:32:27.270 --> 00:32:28.640
We're safe in this area.

00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:29.690
Google's safe.

00:32:29.690 --> 00:32:30.720
Sea Hawk fans here?

00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:31.515
Any?

00:32:31.515 --> 00:32:32.140
AUDIENCE: Whoo!

00:32:32.140 --> 00:32:32.420
ROSE McALEESE: Yay!

00:32:32.420 --> 00:32:33.870
There's like two of your guys.

00:32:33.870 --> 00:32:37.060
OK, so this is the last poem.

00:32:40.850 --> 00:32:43.610
With a face more judgmental
than a Rorschach,

00:32:43.610 --> 00:32:45.430
he says, that's funny.

00:32:45.430 --> 00:32:47.770
You don't dance
like a white girl.

00:32:47.770 --> 00:32:51.360
Now before I can apply
to his ignorant comment,

00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:54.010
my beloved drunken friend
reassures him (TIPSY VOICE)

00:32:54.010 --> 00:32:56.160
well, that is because
Rose is a unicorn!

00:32:58.790 --> 00:33:00.200
Sha sha sha sha!

00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:02.500
Where are my shoes?

00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:07.370
I do not spill drinks when
I dance, because, well, I

00:33:07.370 --> 00:33:07.960
don't drink.

00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:10.400
And also I need my
hands always to be free.

00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:13.240
I do not chase boys.

00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:15.980
I run in place.

00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:17.990
I'm a tall glass
of water that likes

00:33:17.990 --> 00:33:19.590
to get loose-limbed,
like liquid.

00:33:19.590 --> 00:33:21.060
Give me your marble!

00:33:21.060 --> 00:33:22.440
Give me your hard wood!

00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:25.255
Give me your bar top, even
roof of moving vehicle

00:33:25.255 --> 00:33:28.910
to truly tell you how my feet
met floor a long time ago.

00:33:28.910 --> 00:33:31.380
And I dare not separate
the three of them.

00:33:31.380 --> 00:33:34.120
I don't even need
music to dance,

00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:36.920
because that way I
can never be off beat.

00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:39.240
In middle school, I
was an awkward bag

00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:40.730
of bones and untalented ticks.

00:33:40.730 --> 00:33:43.700
Some might say a skinny
excuse, a spastic.

00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:46.250
My friends used to
threaten me by saying,

00:33:46.250 --> 00:33:50.850
Rose, if you can't dance,
we can't be friends.

00:33:50.850 --> 00:33:52.042
This scared me straight.

00:33:52.042 --> 00:33:54.250
But not straight enough I
couldn't learn how to bend.

00:33:54.250 --> 00:33:56.840
Since then, I have been
sweating for unreasons

00:33:56.840 --> 00:33:57.830
unknown to the masses.

00:33:57.830 --> 00:34:00.550
And it's because my body
thinks the Rapture is coming.

00:34:00.550 --> 00:34:03.760
And I need to produce holy
water to save me and my dance

00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:04.640
partner.

00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:08.960
People on average usually
notice three things about me.

00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:11.560
One, she talks a lot.

00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:13.760
And if she's not
talking, I'm smiling.

00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:15.330
And if I'm not
smiling, I'm dancing.

00:34:15.330 --> 00:34:17.139
And for me,
dancing's just my way

00:34:17.139 --> 00:34:19.190
of smiling through
a conversation.

00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:21.750
We don't even need
to talk to get along,

00:34:21.750 --> 00:34:23.870
just the heavy amount
of body language.

00:34:23.870 --> 00:34:26.270
And everyone is fluent in that.

00:34:26.270 --> 00:34:29.690
If you don't leave
me, well, hey.

00:34:29.690 --> 00:34:31.330
One of us is lying
and it isn't me,

00:34:31.330 --> 00:34:33.730
because well, I don't
take anything lying down.

00:34:33.730 --> 00:34:34.560
Baby!

00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:37.679
I can make my hips tick faster
than any maternal clock.

00:34:37.679 --> 00:34:39.710
I can make your head ring
like a jewelry store.

00:34:39.710 --> 00:34:40.429
Ay, yo, yo.

00:34:40.429 --> 00:34:41.270
You hungry?

00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:42.250
Try my salsa.

00:34:42.250 --> 00:34:45.500
And may cause your girlfriend
a serious heartburn.

00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:47.630
I am a party baby.

00:34:47.630 --> 00:34:50.130
I will make you cry and like it.

00:34:50.130 --> 00:34:53.070
I'm also a natural-born ham.

00:34:53.070 --> 00:34:55.449
That's why I'm cutting
this rug like a butcher.

00:34:55.449 --> 00:34:57.790
Now, I have
ballrooms in my belly

00:34:57.790 --> 00:35:00.140
and a funky ruckus
in my armpits.

00:35:00.140 --> 00:35:03.250
But sometimes, I'm not
good with my words.

00:35:03.250 --> 00:35:04.880
So I have this face
where, like, when

00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:06.560
I'm really embarrassed--
like I'm kind of probably

00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:08.490
doing it right now, my face
turns bright red, which is just

00:35:08.490 --> 00:35:09.820
so bad, it's really obnoxious.

00:35:09.820 --> 00:35:10.892
Then I have this
yoga position where

00:35:10.892 --> 00:35:12.142
I can put my food in my mouth.

00:35:12.142 --> 00:35:15.740
But my spine thinks otherwise.

00:35:15.740 --> 00:35:18.120
The only time my body
seems to align perfectly

00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:20.100
is when I'm on this very stage.

00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:23.690
And the only time I've ever
allow myself to feel beautiful

00:35:23.690 --> 00:35:25.060
is when I'm dancing.

00:35:25.060 --> 00:35:27.910
We make gods when we dance.

00:35:27.910 --> 00:35:30.120
But dancing has
never been a God.

00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:32.370
So there's no need
for your judgment day.

00:35:32.370 --> 00:35:34.980
You better rock, span,
spit, stripe your dress

00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:36.360
from however you please.

00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:40.170
Everyone was meant
to move like this.

00:35:40.170 --> 00:35:43.900
Now, the ignorant ink
blot of the man at the bar

00:35:43.900 --> 00:35:46.600
is now lost for words.

00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:48.930
I begin to turn away to
dance this moment off.

00:35:48.930 --> 00:35:52.620
He stops me and
asks if he can join.

00:35:52.620 --> 00:35:55.820
And I said, oh
sweetie, that's cute.

00:35:55.820 --> 00:35:59.020
But I think it's best
that you just back, relax,

00:35:59.020 --> 00:36:00.700
turn my body into a hashtag.

00:36:00.700 --> 00:36:03.000
Tweet about this
for your safety.

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:08.390
And I'll truly show you how a
unicorn human being breaks it

00:36:08.390 --> 00:36:09.820
down.

00:36:09.820 --> 00:36:10.830
Thanks, guys.

00:36:10.830 --> 00:36:12.294
AUDIENCE: [APPLAUSE]

00:36:12.294 --> 00:36:14.246
ROSE McALEESE: Whoo!

00:36:14.246 --> 00:36:16.990
We out of here, Pippo!

00:36:16.990 --> 00:36:18.650
Oh, we're going
to take questions.

00:36:18.650 --> 00:36:19.390
Oh, I didn't know it was that.

00:36:19.390 --> 00:36:20.690
Does anyone have a question?

00:36:20.690 --> 00:36:21.710
This is cool.

00:36:21.710 --> 00:36:25.904
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
Canadian or Russian?

00:36:25.904 --> 00:36:27.250
ROSE McALEESE: [LAUGHS] Yeah!

00:36:27.250 --> 00:36:29.690
I like it.

00:36:29.690 --> 00:36:32.340
Someone suggested that Pippo
should be a Canadian accent.

00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:34.025
How do you feel about that?

00:36:34.025 --> 00:36:34.900
AUDIENCE: Or Russian.

00:36:34.900 --> 00:36:35.983
ROSE McALEESE: Or Russian.

00:36:35.983 --> 00:36:37.390
He could be Russian.

00:36:37.390 --> 00:36:38.330
I have this theory.

00:36:38.330 --> 00:36:40.540
I wrote a list once.

00:36:40.540 --> 00:36:44.070
I do social media
as a form of payment

00:36:44.070 --> 00:36:45.820
sometimes, which is so funny.

00:36:45.820 --> 00:36:47.060
I get paid to Tweet.

00:36:47.060 --> 00:36:49.092
And one of the lists
I came up with,

00:36:49.092 --> 00:36:50.800
because I was so
frustrated with the job,

00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:52.880
was Things Pippo is Famous For.

00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:54.660
He's a famous jewel thief.

00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:58.310
He is actually the original
member in the Beatles.

00:36:58.310 --> 00:37:02.090
He is also what Sherlock
Holmes was based on.

00:37:02.090 --> 00:37:05.310
He is Watson and Sherlock.

00:37:05.310 --> 00:37:06.560
Yeah, he's a pretty great guy.

00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:08.330
He used to have
these red overalls,

00:37:08.330 --> 00:37:10.214
but I lost them in
a movie theater.

00:37:10.214 --> 00:37:12.005
I lost them watching
the movie "Beethoven,"

00:37:12.005 --> 00:37:13.960
if anyone remembers
that-- the dog.

00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:16.536
His hands are also Velcro.

00:37:16.536 --> 00:37:17.930
But he's getting old.

00:37:17.930 --> 00:37:19.960
Oops, story.

00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:22.925
He's fine.

00:37:22.925 --> 00:37:26.750
Look, he's so regal.

00:37:26.750 --> 00:37:28.252
Anyway.

00:37:28.252 --> 00:37:30.545
Oh my god, you have a question!

00:37:30.545 --> 00:37:31.170
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:37:31.170 --> 00:37:32.310
I have two questions.

00:37:32.310 --> 00:37:33.310
ROSE McALEESE: OK.

00:37:33.310 --> 00:37:35.806
AUDIENCE: One is what
grades do you teach?

00:37:35.806 --> 00:37:37.110
ROSE McALEESE: Oh, OK.

00:37:37.110 --> 00:37:38.030
Mostly high school.

00:37:38.030 --> 00:37:39.738
I don't really do well
in middle schools,

00:37:39.738 --> 00:37:42.120
because I feel like I didn't
do well in middle school.

00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:44.730
I had a lot of fun
in high school.

00:37:44.730 --> 00:37:45.710
Fun fact.

00:37:45.710 --> 00:37:47.512
The man who introduced
me, Nathan, we

00:37:47.512 --> 00:37:49.470
went to middle school
and high school together.

00:37:49.470 --> 00:37:52.940
We were both nominated
Most School Spirited.

00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:54.750
So that was kind of
me in high school.

00:37:54.750 --> 00:37:55.970
I was just this weirdo.

00:37:55.970 --> 00:37:59.120
So I teach 9th
through 12th grade.

00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:01.390
But I really love teaching
freshman, because they just

00:38:01.390 --> 00:38:04.150
seem the most awkward-est.
If you can't tell,

00:38:04.150 --> 00:38:06.817
I'm like a jellyfish
caught in a blender.

00:38:06.817 --> 00:38:08.900
I don't know what to do
with myself half the time.

00:38:08.900 --> 00:38:10.250
AUDIENCE: I have an
interview question.

00:38:10.250 --> 00:38:12.125
ROSE McALEESE: You have
a interview question?

00:38:12.125 --> 00:38:13.460
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:38:13.460 --> 00:38:15.321
ROSE McALEESE: Yeah.

00:38:15.321 --> 00:38:15.820
Wait.

00:38:15.820 --> 00:38:17.662
Oh my god, so OK, I did
research on you guys

00:38:17.662 --> 00:38:19.620
by watching this movie
called "The Internship."

00:38:19.620 --> 00:38:20.406
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:38:20.406 --> 00:38:21.281
ROSE McALEESE: Right?

00:38:21.281 --> 00:38:22.370
And then the Google.

00:38:22.370 --> 00:38:22.720
Here's the thing.

00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:24.780
When they asked the
question about the blender,

00:38:24.780 --> 00:38:26.380
the immediate thing
I thought of was

00:38:26.380 --> 00:38:28.080
the blender will eventually die.

00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:29.800
So you just chill out.

00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:31.720
And that's exactly what
they do in the movie.

00:38:31.720 --> 00:38:33.860
So where's my
internship, Google?

00:38:33.860 --> 00:38:36.970
I answered the question.

00:38:36.970 --> 00:38:42.170
I bet, Pippo's probably going
to get a job offer and me.

00:38:42.170 --> 00:38:42.670
Whatever.

00:38:42.670 --> 00:38:47.230
He's talking smack right now.

00:38:47.230 --> 00:38:50.830
What other questions do they ask
you at Google for a interview?

00:38:50.830 --> 00:38:52.650
Is it just that, the
only hypothetical one.

00:38:52.650 --> 00:38:55.040
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:57.845
ROSE McALEESE: I'm going to
talk to the HR department.

00:38:57.845 --> 00:39:00.345
I'm going to come up with some
weird questions for you guys.

00:39:00.345 --> 00:39:02.261
Like, what reality show
would you try out for?

00:39:02.261 --> 00:39:05.005
Which Kardashian do you
think is your spirit animal?

00:39:05.005 --> 00:39:06.127
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:39:06.127 --> 00:39:07.460
ROSE McALEESE: Things like that.

00:39:07.460 --> 00:39:11.130
Which I think tell a lot about
a person, like I'm a Khloe!

00:39:11.130 --> 00:39:11.810
Makes sense.

00:39:14.497 --> 00:39:15.330
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:39:15.330 --> 00:39:16.704
I'll ask my second
question then.

00:39:16.704 --> 00:39:18.620
ROSE McALEESE: Yeah.

00:39:18.620 --> 00:39:21.430
AUDIENCE: If I can remember it.

00:39:21.430 --> 00:39:23.590
So, with your
reading disability,

00:39:23.590 --> 00:39:26.350
how do you go from a
chicken scratch to a book?

00:39:26.350 --> 00:39:28.250
ROSE McALEESE: So think god.

00:39:28.250 --> 00:39:31.670
Oh my god, I have a great
editor who's also my roommate.

00:39:31.670 --> 00:39:32.170
My mother.

00:39:32.170 --> 00:39:35.250
I love Kathy Cain.

00:39:35.250 --> 00:39:37.250
But yeah, no, I had a
really great editor.

00:39:37.250 --> 00:39:39.420
And my publisher-- so a
funny thing about my book

00:39:39.420 --> 00:39:42.520
is that I made a
paper copy of my book.

00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:45.060
And I hid them in bookstores.

00:39:45.060 --> 00:39:47.830
And my publisher stumbled
across it and was

00:39:47.830 --> 00:39:50.360
like, wow, this is really cool.

00:39:50.360 --> 00:39:51.567
I actually know this girl.

00:39:51.567 --> 00:39:53.900
And this publisher was actually
a family friend of mine.

00:39:53.900 --> 00:39:56.720
And she was like I didn't know
you wanted to publish a book so

00:39:56.720 --> 00:39:57.750
let's publish a book.

00:39:57.750 --> 00:40:02.090
So literally, it's lots of
editors and things like that.

00:40:02.090 --> 00:40:05.286
And I do a lot of
exercises and stuff

00:40:05.286 --> 00:40:06.910
that have helped me
with my disability.

00:40:06.910 --> 00:40:07.967
It used to be way worse.

00:40:07.967 --> 00:40:09.800
Like in fifth grade, I
had the reading level

00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:11.330
of a kindergartner.

00:40:11.330 --> 00:40:13.580
Now I have the reading
level of a fifth grader.

00:40:13.580 --> 00:40:14.380
So it's great.

00:40:14.380 --> 00:40:16.360
I love those "Lemony
Snicket" books.

00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:18.290
Man, they really understand me.

00:40:18.290 --> 00:40:21.720
Except they have really
big words in that book.

00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:23.370
But yeah, now I
just have an editor.

00:40:23.370 --> 00:40:25.770
And as much as I hate
writing on a computer,

00:40:25.770 --> 00:40:28.240
spell check is a lot of fun.

00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:31.250
But if you're dyslexic,
there's a lot of loopholes.

00:40:31.250 --> 00:40:34.630
Like I can write the word "I,"
when I really mean myself.

00:40:34.630 --> 00:40:36.510
I can write this eye
when I mean this I.

00:40:36.510 --> 00:40:38.230
And spell check
won't correct it.

00:40:38.230 --> 00:40:42.810
There needs to be a grammar
check, especially on Twitter.

00:40:42.810 --> 00:40:43.840
The your and you're.

00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:44.775
Oh, I hate that.

00:40:44.775 --> 00:40:47.140
Or there and their.

00:40:47.140 --> 00:40:48.110
Remember DOL?

00:40:48.110 --> 00:40:51.076
They don't teach that
in schools anymore?

00:40:51.076 --> 00:40:51.690
Is that it?

00:40:51.690 --> 00:40:53.174
Am I good to-- You
have a question?

00:40:53.174 --> 00:40:55.382
AUDIENCE: So you're perfectly
happy for your spelling

00:40:55.382 --> 00:40:56.110
to be corrected.

00:40:56.110 --> 00:40:58.885
You don't feel like
that it loses something?

00:40:58.885 --> 00:41:00.260
ROSE McALEESE:
No, I don't really

00:41:00.260 --> 00:41:02.520
mind when people
correct my spelling.

00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:05.300
I bet my friends and my family
and friends and my boyfriend

00:41:05.300 --> 00:41:08.750
can tell you I do these
idiosyncricities or something

00:41:08.750 --> 00:41:09.710
like that.

00:41:09.710 --> 00:41:10.920
I also have a mush mouth.

00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:12.460
So I grew up with
an Irish father,

00:41:12.460 --> 00:41:14.350
where I had an accent
when I was little.

00:41:14.350 --> 00:41:17.210
And because of that, I feel
like I can't say certain words

00:41:17.210 --> 00:41:19.500
correctly, which on top
of a reason disability,

00:41:19.500 --> 00:41:22.680
just makes me like a
really great comic strip.

00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:26.110
But I don't have an issue
with people correcting me

00:41:26.110 --> 00:41:27.280
with spelling.

00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:28.780
I kind of have more
of an issue when

00:41:28.780 --> 00:41:31.600
people correct when I
pronounce things wrong.

00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:33.400
Like what's that word I say?

00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:34.510
PO-tin-ate.

00:41:34.510 --> 00:41:35.090
Potinate.

00:41:35.090 --> 00:41:36.060
But it's just potent.

00:41:36.060 --> 00:41:38.060
For some reason, I want
the word to be potinate.

00:41:38.060 --> 00:41:41.510
Or upstairges
instead of upstairs.

00:41:41.510 --> 00:41:42.311
I can't say that.

00:41:42.311 --> 00:41:44.310
Yeah, there's a lot of
weird things I say wrong.

00:41:44.310 --> 00:41:46.260
Like fa-SHE-shis.

00:41:46.260 --> 00:41:48.500
That's not the word.

00:41:48.500 --> 00:41:51.130
I have real trouble
with speaking.

00:41:51.130 --> 00:41:53.441
English is hard.

00:41:53.441 --> 00:41:53.940
GAIR-age.

00:41:53.940 --> 00:41:57.129
And I say that, like
a parking garage.

00:41:57.129 --> 00:41:57.920
That's really hard.

00:41:57.920 --> 00:42:00.260
Oh, the letter before I
in the alphabet, is HAIH.

00:42:00.260 --> 00:42:02.690
It will always be haich.

00:42:02.690 --> 00:42:05.365
But there are ones that
I got rid of. [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:05.365 --> 00:42:06.840
feel like that one.

00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:09.480
But I used to make fun
of my dad and family

00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:11.760
for saying PRIHV-a-cy,
instead of PRI-va-cy.

00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:14.180
But I say it sometimes,
and that one's just ugly.

00:42:14.180 --> 00:42:15.792
So you can correct
me on that one.

00:42:15.792 --> 00:42:18.250
But no, I have no issue with
people correcting my spelling.

00:42:18.250 --> 00:42:19.150
Do it.

00:42:19.150 --> 00:42:20.810
Please.

00:42:20.810 --> 00:42:22.270
It's bad.

00:42:22.270 --> 00:42:23.170
Anyway.

00:42:23.170 --> 00:42:25.411
Like, why is there
a D in Wednesday?

00:42:25.411 --> 00:42:25.910
OK, sorry.

00:42:25.910 --> 00:42:26.409
I'm done.

00:42:26.409 --> 00:42:27.640
We should leave.

00:42:27.640 --> 00:42:28.260
Thanks, guys!

00:42:28.260 --> 00:42:29.240
I hope you enjoyed.

00:42:29.240 --> 00:42:34.194
AUDIENCE: [APPLAUSE]
