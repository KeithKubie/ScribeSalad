00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:23.860
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: We are
so happy to have you here.

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:26.660
You are in for a real
treat today with some music

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.320
that you are not going to hear
that often, especially live.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.380
My name is David Plylar, I
am with the concert office.

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.750
The Library of Congress and it's
my distinct pleasure to be here

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:43.310
with Maestro Sandro Ivo Bartoli
who will be giving us a program

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:48.670 position:56%
that largely focuses on Bach but
through the lenses of [foreign name]

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:54.620
who is, we are celebrating
his 150th birthday this year.

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.430
So, I was thinking
maybe we could start

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.330
with just maybe you
could say a few words

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.660
about this program
and how it came about.

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:03.960
&gt;&gt; Sandro Ivo Bartoli:
Oh absolutely.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.690
Can you hear me?

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.460
[inaudible] First of all, let
me say forgive me for the delay

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:11.760
but after all I am Italian.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.450
I have to be a little late.

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.340
[laughter] It would
not be in character.

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.250
The program well in my
opinion I hope in a couple

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.580
of hours you will agree with
me it's a beautiful program.

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:30.400
It's in a way it's a pianist dream
because [foreign name] was one

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.000
of the greatest authors
of piano music.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.160
Pretty much everything that
he did you can sense a joy

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:39.460
of playing the piano.

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:45.630
His music is written magnificently
for our instrument and a lot

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.430
of the inspiration as some
people say come from Poppa Bach

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.760
who was probably the greatest
composer of the entire history

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.670
of music and beyond, really.

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.140 position:56%
We have a little bit of an intrusion
in the second half of [inaudible].

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.530
Who happens to be again another one

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.200
of my favorite composers
for many reasons.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.390
But one of the many reasons is that
his music is very much nefarious.

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:15.530
It encompasses a huge range
of emotions and as a composer

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.480
that I admire very much but
he is not very well known,

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:19.780
his name is [foreign name].

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.880
He used to say that without
the emotion there is nothing

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.080
and certainly this will not
be the case this afternoon.

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.900
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Well,
this so the opening work

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:37.190
on the program is maybe one of
Busoni's most performed pieces

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:42.880
and it's a transcription of a
solo violin work and there's,

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.510
it's notable I think
it's good to mention that

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.470
but had I not mentioned it and
then had you had never heard it

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.180
by chance you might
not have any idea

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.170
that it originated as
a solo violin work.

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.150
It seems like it fits really
naturally as a piano piece

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.040
in the way that he adapted it.

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.650
&gt;&gt; Sandro Ivo Bartoli:
Well, Busoni was a bit

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:02.950
of a [inaudible] in distinct.

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.200
I mean that fact that he
turned between the 19th

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.170
and the 20th century he became
so popular as a transcriber

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.010
that you know he began to actually
bother people because he was

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.250 position:56%
so imaginative in his way of writing
for the piano that he did a lot

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.600
of transcription for the organ
works of Bach and those also

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.410
in his version become so
idiomatic for our instrument

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.360
that you know unless you know
the region you wouldn't guess

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.210
that the original was
written for other instrument.

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:35.810
Which I believe is a testament to
his musical and pianistic genius.

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:37.110
Absolutely.

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:38.480
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: No, I
agree and one of the things

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.020
that I think is good to listen for.

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:45.840
How many just by curiosity
how many are you familiar

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.960
with the original [foreign
name] for solo violin?

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.720
It's worth checking out after you
are done with this because one

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.350
of the things that you'll
find is there's a repeating,

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:00.130
basically a base line in
repeating tune that you'll hear

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:05.330
and Busoni clarifies it throughout
the entire piece and it's one

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.010
of the ways that he
contributes to it in addition

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:12.200
to just having incredibly
imaginative writing.

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.150
&gt;&gt; Sandro Ivo Bartoli:
Well, it's to me,

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:19.940
the first time I heard the [foreign
name] I was a young kid really

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:24.220
and it was played by this
person who became my mentor.

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:30.580
A pianist named [foreign name]
and the impression he gave me was

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:35.630
like an old man telling a story to
a younger person and that's perhaps

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:39.880 position:56%
because of this reoccurring theme on
the ground base which is fantastic.

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.430
But then also you know of course I
wanted to learn the [foreign name]

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:45.830
and then I became friends with
[foreign name] of the story

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:47.450
but I learned of the origin

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:49.090
of the [foreign name]
from Spain apparently.

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:52.780
And it was an erotic dance so I
fell in love with it immediately.

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:54.330
Absolutely.

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:55.630
All over again.

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:56.930
[laughter]

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:58.570
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: [laughter] I am
not sure how to follow that up

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:01.410 position:56%
but you are going to enjoy it a lot.

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:10.990
The second piece in the program is
this wonderful kind of amalgamation

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:16.920
of Busoni's thought with Bach and
it's basically an interaction.

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:21.460 position:56%
It's like you are watching a meeting
of minds between Busoni and Bach

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:26.630
through the, using the art of
fugue as kind of the focal point.

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:28.770
What can you say about that piece?

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:31.300
I mean there's so much that
you can say about it but to you

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:36.690
as a pianist especially how do
approach this kind of a work?

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:39.930
That's part transcription
part composition part lots

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:41.550
of other stuff?

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:43.850
&gt;&gt; Sandro Ivo Bartoli: Well,
I devoted a lot of my time

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:49.010
to the study of Busoni's music
and his life of course I had

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:50.390
to play the fantasy of [inaudible].

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:55.920
His most important
work for solo piano.

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:59.790
The underline theme is that
it is the completion of Bach

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:03.220
and finished work the art of fugue.

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:08.280
Bach left what was essentially
a quadruple feud unfinished

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:10.300
after the entrance
of the third subject.

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:12.260
Which is his own name.

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:17.630
And very many people in the 1800's
suggested possible conclusion

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:19.800
but nobody really did
anything with it.

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:25.530
But Busoni actually did
complete the quadruple fugue.

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:30.200
You must bear in mind that
Senor Busoni was a rather,

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:32.730
had a very large personality.

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:35.190
He was not content with
completing the fugue.

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:36.900
I mean he wrote the huge preludes

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:41.950
to this quadruple fugue then
there's a little interned or a set

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:44.690
of variations on the
themes from the fugue.

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:52.290
[foreign names] The work grew
to rather monumental proportions

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:55.970
but I think there are two elements
to the fantasy of [foreign name]

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:58.380
that they are fundamental.

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:03.740
The first is that Busoni said it
was a piece compiled for the piano.

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:08.870
So, it's not really a concert piece
in the accepted sense of the word.

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:12.230
And the second and perhaps most
important is not only a meeting

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:15.500
of two minds which through
Bach and Senor Busoni

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:18.540
but there too is a
meeting of two times.

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:24.440 position:56%
Because he manages in this piece to
embroider the original Bach material

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:27.300
into an early 20th century idiom.

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:29.890
And then towards the
middle of the composition,

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:35.790 position:56%
Bach is of course left behind and
it becomes Busoni at times it sounds

00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:39.210
like [foreign name] on acid and
we went also with the harmonies,

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:40.780
you know, it went really crazy.

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:45.910
But it's part of the beauty of
this very, very important piece.

00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:50.620
I mean none other than Dr.
Albert Schweitzer who was

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:52.250
to win the Nobel Prize for Peace

00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:57.470
but in his own right was a great
musicologist and scholar of Bach.

00:07:57.470 --> 00:08:01.380
He admired very much this work that
Busoni had done and he proclaimed

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:05.020
that Busoni found the solution to
the riddle of Bach's last fugue.

00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:07.260
It's no mean fete.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:08.560
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: I should mention

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:12.010
that after this talk before the
concert we have a first addition

00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:15.350
of the Art of Fugue from
actually sadly from 1800.

00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:18.920
But we have that out and we
have that open to a place

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:22.550
where the third fugue subject
enters and that's the BACH.

00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:27.010
So, B flat, A, C, B natural
and that places a major role

00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:30.720
in the full piece as you can see.

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:32.470
But there's actually a
completion to this one

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:33.770
that you should take a look at.

00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:41.860
But it's shortened and not quite
as imaginative as Busoni's.

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:44.850
[laughter] After this at that
point we will take a break

00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:48.380
for intermission but then
we are going to look at Bach

00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:52.800
through a different lens
and this is we actually are,

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:57.740
we programmed a piece that's
based in a Bach cantata movement

00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:03.250
of the [foreign name] and there's
several pieces you may be familiar

00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:06.880
with the variations
on a motive from this.

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:10.570
But this is actually a prelude
that listed composed for the piano.

00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:14.050
The variations was originally
kind of conceived as an organ work

00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:17.800
but the prelude is a piano work
that the Library of Congress has

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:20.500
and we have it on display,
the manuscript for that.

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:23.350
But what do you think of
performing that piece?

00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:24.650
What has that been like?

00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:27.610
I think this is a new
piece for you in terms of.

00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:28.910
&gt;&gt; Sandro Ivo Bartoli: Yes.

00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:31.040 position:56%
Yes, and I should thank you guys for
asking me to do it because you know

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:36.340
of course like most
pianists in the early '90's

00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:39.700
when Mr. Horovitz last cd came out.

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:42.380
He had recorded this piece
which I didn't know at the time

00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:43.900
and oh my God it is beautiful.

00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:45.480
I am going to learn it, you know.

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:49.140
And then of course you always think
well Horovitz is playing is what is

00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:52.520
little stupid me going to do
you know learning this piece.

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:57.550 position:56%
Then of course Mr. Horovitz suddenly
died and you know at various time

00:09:57.550 --> 00:10:00.150
in my life I thought of well
I should learn the Prelude

00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:03.840
such a beautiful piece
but somehow never managed,

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:06.000
mustered the courage to do it.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.740
There was always something
else to do.

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:09.040
And I am Italian after all.

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:13.560 position:56%
So, I never learned it and then when
David mentioned that the Library

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:16.290
of Congress had acquired
the manuscript well

00:10:16.290 --> 00:10:19.820
of course there was no
escape at the point.

00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:21.840
There was of course an adventure

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:25.760
because it is again
the work of a genius.

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:29.510
It takes six or seven notes
from the base of this cantata

00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:36.200
and then the Prelude is a very
short six or seven minutes of music

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:42.100
but it's 20 odd variations on
this tiny little melodic cell.

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:44.290
And one more beautiful
than the other.

00:10:44.290 --> 00:10:45.750
It's also very tragic piece.

00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:47.890
It's very pensive, very.

00:10:47.890 --> 00:10:51.190
I mean the title means
size, tears, sorrow,

00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:55.170
fear and so it's a very
uplifting kind of thing to start.

00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:56.470
[laughter]

00:10:56.470 --> 00:10:59.960
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: But it also it's
you know I think we probably,

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:01.910
I should say that we thought
of this at the very beginning

00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:04.970
but it's a nice, it's
almost like a mirror.

00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:06.500
Rather the [foreign name] in terms

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:10.950
of having another structure that's
similar but just more compacted.

00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:12.900
&gt;&gt; Sandro Ivo Bartoli:
Much more coercive.

00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:19.080
And I think this is getting a
little bit too technical maybe

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:23.220 position:56%
but in this piece, there's a passage
where a list is actually write

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:27.000
like Bach, it's just
a two voice, you know.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.240
Your right hand is
playing one note at a time,

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:31.740
the left-hand mirrors
this one note at a time.

00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:33.040
Very unusual for list.

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:34.700
But there's only four or five bars.

00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:38.640
It could easily Bach except
perhaps for the harmony.

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:40.990
Which is also something that
Busoni does in the Fantasy

00:11:40.990 --> 00:11:44.210
of [foreign name] when he was
writing the [foreign name] minute

00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:47.080
excerpt from which it could
have been written by Bach.

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:52.190
It very much is the meeting of
two minds and also going back

00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:56.070 position:56%
to the beginning except now we are
at the beginning of the second half.

00:11:56.070 --> 00:11:58.770
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: The, one thing
that I wanted to bring up is

00:11:58.770 --> 00:12:05.820 position:56%
that you recently recorded a CD that
was focused on the [foreign name]

00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:08.200
and this is part of
what we, excuse me,

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:12.170
this is part of what the
next two works are from that.

00:12:12.170 --> 00:12:15.780
Well, not from that disc but were
part of that collection of works

00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:17.650
and maybe you could
tell us a bit about that

00:12:17.650 --> 00:12:22.240
because while it's a
departure from the Bach theme,

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:26.440
there is still this religious
connotation that comes through.

00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:31.140
Well, it is not generally known
but you know List at 16 wanted

00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:33.100
to become a Catholic Priest.

00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:36.090
He was prevented by his mother
and we should be thankful

00:12:36.090 --> 00:12:40.390
to his mother I think because
the gain is prosperity.

00:12:40.390 --> 00:12:44.360
But he had this very
romantic, you know, life.

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:48.220
When he was bored reading
a biography, a list.

00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:52.480
He was the first well one of
the first two music superstars.

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:54.070
The other was Paganini.

00:12:54.070 --> 00:13:01.540
But when he was in his 50's,
two of this three children died

00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:03.740
in the space of three years

00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:11.180
and understandably he had a very
profound crisis and after a series

00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:15.350
of again adventures events.

00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:17.700
He took the orders of
the Franciscan order.

00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:22.700
He became a Franciscan monk moved
to Rome to a little monastery

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:25.130
in the outskirts of Rome.

00:13:25.130 --> 00:13:30.490
And began writing religious
music he had been writing

00:13:30.490 --> 00:13:32.220
for quite a few years.

00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:36.280 position:56%
But at the point he began writing
music dedicated to his patron Saints

00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:39.990
for St. Francis of [foreign
name] and St. Francis of power.

00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:43.770
The pieces that they play today
are perhaps the most famous

00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:52.410
of this sphere of the Francesca
music of List and rightly so.

00:13:52.410 --> 00:13:54.070
I mean they are religious pieces

00:13:54.070 --> 00:13:59.050
but they are very comfortable
in the concert also.

00:13:59.050 --> 00:14:03.450
I am very grateful to
Maestro List actually

00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:05.250
because with the [foreign
name] which stayed

00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:07.570
for about ten years earlier.

00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:11.030
It was trying actively to bridge
the gap between the church

00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:14.250
and the concert and the theatre.

00:14:14.250 --> 00:14:16.660
Very successfully in my opinion.

00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:19.780
And before coming here
to America I was invited

00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:25.220
to play the [foreign name] which is
the world's oldest music festival.

00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:29.240
But it's devoted to sacred music.

00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:32.070
So, they very rarely
have pianists play there

00:14:32.070 --> 00:14:36.710
but fortunately I had this music
France List, Francesca music

00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:39.820
so I was able to take part
in this very unusual event

00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:43.600
and you know I wanted to bring a
little part of it over to America.

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:45.450
The American dream [inaudible].

00:14:45.450 --> 00:14:46.750
&gt;&gt; Davis Plylar: Wow.

00:14:46.750 --> 00:14:48.630
You know one thing I should
mention about these pieces

00:14:48.630 --> 00:14:51.830
and also other pieces that are
on that disc that you have is

00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:56.400
that they are also, he has
this, there are also transcript,

00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:58.940
these ones originated
as piano pieces.

00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:02.370
But right afterwards he made
versions for orchestra as well.

00:15:02.370 --> 00:15:05.570
That were I think not
recorded for another century.

00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:08.420
Or not played for another
century or so later

00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:10.640
but there's this interesting
relationship

00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:13.730
between List transcription
of his own works and trying

00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:16.260
to give them different
voices as well

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:21.040
as just having these
original works for solo piano.

00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:22.400
&gt;&gt; Sandro Ivo Bartoli:
Well, I think he knew

00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:25.720
that he had done something
very good with it two legends.

00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:27.830
He also had quite a
nice endorsement.

00:15:27.830 --> 00:15:30.740
He got a visit from the Pope
in this little monastery

00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:35.540
and he played the first legend,
St. Francis preaching to the birds.

00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:42.720
At least the Pope suggested at
least basically concentrated

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:47.580
on earthly harmonies in
preparation for the timeless ones.

00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:50.690
So, effectively encouraged
him to go on in the same way.

00:15:50.690 --> 00:15:52.710
I would have done that.

00:15:52.710 --> 00:15:54.830
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: [laughter]
Yes that's, and we should say

00:15:54.830 --> 00:16:00.660
that there are a lot of bird
sounds in this, in that first one.

00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:03.850
&gt;&gt; Sandro Ivo Bartoli: I am sorry
I have used this word already two

00:16:03.850 --> 00:16:07.150
or three times and maybe I
am affectionate but you know,

00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:11.640
when you go and play with
genius all things up.

00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:19.050
Many people, many composers have
tried to mimic the song of birds

00:16:19.050 --> 00:16:28.410
in music but to [foreign names]
there's a very famous piece,

00:16:28.410 --> 00:16:30.240
Fresco Baldi wrote [foreign name].

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:39.400
Right up to the 20th century when
Mr. [foreign name] actually went

00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:44.320
to the woods, recorded it
on tape, the song of birds.

00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:46.050
And then notated it down.

00:16:46.050 --> 00:16:52.390
List is the only one who
actually made correct impression

00:16:52.390 --> 00:16:54.950
of what a bunch of little
birds sounds like you hear.

00:16:54.950 --> 00:16:56.310
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: And
he wasn't limited

00:16:56.310 --> 00:17:02.390
to 140 characters for
his tweets but.

00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:08.720
[laughter] So, moving passed
on to the final work just

00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:15.120
to tie it together to,
back to Busoni and to Bach.

00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:19.460
This is a piece that I
feel is really underheard

00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:23.460
and not underappreciated for sure.

00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:27.520
It started off as an organ
work, it's a fantasy in fugue

00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:34.050
on the [foreign name] which
was a part of a Miarbere Opera

00:17:34.050 --> 00:17:40.810
that had just come out in 1849
la Parfet and List made a series

00:17:40.810 --> 00:17:45.850 position:56%
of three illustrations that came out
first and then he really got stuck

00:17:45.850 --> 00:17:50.820
on this theme and decided to make
this giant structure for organ

00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:56.330
that is where we hear a fantasy,
a large fantasy, a central kind

00:17:56.330 --> 00:17:58.880
of [foreign name], quiet
very beautiful section.

00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:02.760
Followed by a magnificent fugue
that is based on the crowd tune

00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:06.150
and then Busoni recognized
the greatness of this piece

00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:10.900
and took his expertise in
transcription and brang it

00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:13.630
to the world of piano music.

00:18:13.630 --> 00:18:17.450
And have you performed this much?

00:18:17.450 --> 00:18:19.030
Does it get asked for?

00:18:19.030 --> 00:18:21.870
&gt;&gt; Sandro Ivo Bartoli: I
performed it a few times.

00:18:21.870 --> 00:18:24.490
I recorded it a few years ago.

00:18:24.490 --> 00:18:27.830 position:56%
But it's such a, again a huge piece.

00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:29.960
I think it's about
a half an hour long.

00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:33.170
You don't get that many
chances putting it [inaudible].

00:18:33.170 --> 00:18:39.720
You know, fortunately also in
order to program half an hour takes

00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:44.240
up maybe, it's usually it's
about the third of the length

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:48.260
of piano recital and
promoted producers they say

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:51.190
in England they want to
put bombs in the seats.

00:18:51.190 --> 00:18:53.460
They need to sell tickets
and so they don't

00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:58.050
like if you play this long
pieces that nobody knows.

00:18:58.050 --> 00:19:01.690 position:56%
When they hear it then usually they
like it because it is a masterpiece.

00:19:01.690 --> 00:19:03.860
But I don't get to
play it all the time.

00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:06.740
I am delighted I can do it today.

00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:09.000
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: No, I am really
pleased especially it ties

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:13.290
in so well because one of the
things that is also really great

00:19:13.290 --> 00:19:17.730
about Busoni that most people don't
know about him is that he was also

00:19:17.730 --> 00:19:21.780
or I should say many people don't
know maybe you all know this.

00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:26.600
Is that he was also a good
explainer of what he was doing.

00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:30.630
So, he would write about his
processes of transcription

00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:34.200
and really elucidate it so
that one could follow that.

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:37.210
One could learn from
that and do it oneself.

00:19:37.210 --> 00:19:39.950
Maybe not to the level of a Busoni

00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:43.310
but you can see him applying this
school of thought that he took

00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:49.980 position:56%
to the Bach organ works, applying it
to the later List work in this case.

00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:53.220
And it's just a fascinating
thing to study I think.

00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:56.180
&gt;&gt; Sandro Ivo Bartoli:
Well, it's also a lesson,

00:19:56.180 --> 00:20:00.050
a huge lesson in piano
playing and piano writing.

00:20:00.050 --> 00:20:03.180
The piece is magnificent.

00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:07.530
It ought to rank among the
best piano writing ever.

00:20:07.530 --> 00:20:10.490
The effect that Senior Busoni

00:20:10.490 --> 00:20:16.180
to recreate the piano
for, I mean you hear it.

00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:20.680
It's a monument to the art of
playing the piano or the craft

00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:23.760
of playing the piano rather.

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:27.110
It is not very classy of me to say
this but it is very tricky to play

00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:29.940
so maybe that's part of the
reason why it is very long.

00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:32.560
It's not very well known.

00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:35.360
And you need to invest a
lot of time in learning it.

00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:41.090
Because really it only stretches
the limit of what pianist can do.

00:20:41.090 --> 00:20:43.880
I think Alan Walker
called it a pinnacle

00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:48.370
in 20th century [inaudible] Got
the century wrong unfortunately.

00:20:48.370 --> 00:20:51.500
[laughter] 18th century,
19th century.

00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:53.050
[laughter]

00:20:53.050 --> 00:20:57.270
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Well, I think
we actually need to get going

00:20:57.270 --> 00:20:59.890
so that you can have
some time to get ready

00:20:59.890 --> 00:21:03.560
for today maybe before we
go do we have time for one

00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:05.110
or two questions from the audience?

00:21:05.110 --> 00:21:06.410
&gt;&gt; Sandro Ivo Bartoli: Absolutely.

00:21:06.410 --> 00:21:08.100
Yes. Yes. Shoot away
if you have questions.

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:13.740
&gt;&gt; We have a mic if, hang on.

00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:19.500
&gt;&gt; Reading your read ahead last
night and I went to Wikipedia

00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:24.940 position:56%
to study the because I didn't know
much about Missoni and I was reading

00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:30.550 position:56%
about he came out with some theories
and semitone and I am wondering

00:21:30.550 --> 00:21:32.510
if will we be hearing any of that?

00:21:32.510 --> 00:21:33.810
&gt;&gt; Sandro Ivo Bartoli: No.

00:21:33.810 --> 00:21:35.110
No. No. No.

00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:39.210
No. It was called many times the
last renaissance man you know.

00:21:39.210 --> 00:21:41.160
With many interests.

00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:42.460
He painted.

00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:49.640
He was an artist, composer,
great pianist, etc. It advised

00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:53.050
for instance a new
system on notation.

00:21:53.050 --> 00:21:57.350
A fantasy from Bach, grammatic
fantasy fugue in this new system

00:21:57.350 --> 00:21:59.210
that he had invented
where the pianist played.

00:21:59.210 --> 00:22:02.940
It was like a 20th century
version of [foreign name].

00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:05.680 position:56%
Of what they used to do [inaudible].

00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:09.150
He got very fascinated with cartage
tones and he invented the scales

00:22:09.150 --> 00:22:13.850
that I believe 115 pigmentation

00:22:13.850 --> 00:22:18.070
but sometimes is intellectual
side was a little bit

00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:19.800
over bearing to cover.

00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:25.620
None of his innovation,
none of them took any hold

00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:31.480
but if you are interested
there's a book that was published

00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:35.420
in English called a Sketch
for a New Esthetic of Music.

00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:39.600
First addition I think 1907 in
German and then got translated

00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:46.230
in [inaudible] it's only about 70
pages but it's full of great ideas.

00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:49.130
One of the most endearing to me is

00:22:49.130 --> 00:22:52.960
that defending the
art of transcription.

00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:56.520
He said that when a composer
actually writes down a piece

00:22:56.520 --> 00:23:00.120
of music he is already
committing the act of transcribing,

00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:05.610
an abstract idea into a
definite constricted medium.

00:23:05.610 --> 00:23:10.250
So, that's maybe the best key to
approach the music of Senior Busoni

00:23:10.250 --> 00:23:14.320
and also, we are lucky enough
we have some acoustic recording

00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:15.760
of Busoni playing.

00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:19.680
The small things but they are not
so small they are one of Lists

00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:23.420
and Garner Rhapsody
I think is number 15

00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:26.880
that give you a pretty good idea

00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:31.410
of truly superhuman
capabilities as a musician.

00:23:31.410 --> 00:23:34.840
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Do we
have any other questions?

00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:40.300
Well, why don't I, I wanted before
I finish here I just want also

00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:43.010
to thank the Italian Cultural
Institute of Washington D.C.

00:23:43.010 --> 00:23:45.970
for their support of
this concert as well.

00:23:45.970 --> 00:23:47.730
We really appreciate that.

00:23:47.730 --> 00:23:49.240
And if you can all just join me

00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:52.790
in thanking Maestro
Bartoli for joining us.

00:23:52.790 --> 00:23:54.590
&gt;&gt; Sandro Ivo Bartoli: Thank you.

00:23:54.590 --> 00:23:59.080
[ Applause ]

00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:02.200
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
