UI should I use a separate async task
 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.180
UI should I use a separate async task
for every API call and how to

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190
for every API call and how to
 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.689
for every API call and how to
communicate to the UI properly Thanks

00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:01.699
communicate to the UI properly Thanks
 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:08.660

all right so it's a service and an async

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670
all right so it's a service and an async
 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.870
all right so it's a service and an async
API calls and they want to know if it's

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880
API calls and they want to know if it's
 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.639
API calls and they want to know if it's
okay to use separate async tests or

00:01:13.639 --> 00:01:13.649
okay to use separate async tests or
 

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:17.000
okay to use separate async tests or
every API call I think that's probably

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:17.010
every API call I think that's probably
 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:18.940
every API call I think that's probably
okay depending on the nature of your API

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950
okay depending on the nature of your API
 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:24.320
okay depending on the nature of your API
so the thing that I put with with async

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330
so the thing that I put with with async
 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.810
so the thing that I put with with async
task is if your application ends for

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820
task is if your application ends for
 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.190
task is if your application ends for
some reason so you rotate your screen

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200
some reason so you rotate your screen

bit more careful and make sure that your
async task actually can run to

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710
async task actually can run to
 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.280
async task actually can run to
completion or at the very least that if

you make it so that when your app
 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:14.120
you make it so that when your app
restarts no you check to see if that's

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130

users don't always have an internet
 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:44.770

wants people to read their information
you know if let's say you're a feed

00:02:57.309 --> 00:02:57.319
you know if let's say you're a feed
 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:58.509
you know if let's say you're a feed
reader right the user still wants access

00:02:58.509 --> 00:02:58.519
reader right the user still wants access
 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:00.580
reader right the user still wants access
to the RSS feeds if you have a

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590
to the RSS feeds if you have a
 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:01.929
to the RSS feeds if you have a
background service you can go and make

00:03:01.929 --> 00:03:01.939
background service you can go and make
 

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:03.369
background service you can go and make
sure all this is cached and available

00:03:03.369 --> 00:03:03.379
sure all this is cached and available
 

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:05.080
sure all this is cached and available
inside of a content provider if you're

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090
inside of a content provider if you're
 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:06.459
inside of a content provider if you're
just doing an async task to get it live

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:06.469
just doing an async task to get it live
 

00:03:06.469 --> 00:03:09.369
just doing an async task to get it live
all that's gonna fail so I think that's

00:03:09.369 --> 00:03:09.379
all that's gonna fail so I think that's
 

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:11.140
all that's gonna fail so I think that's
really the big benefit to use a service

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150
really the big benefit to use a service
 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.149
really the big benefit to use a service
and so for that reason yeah you probably

00:03:13.149 --> 00:03:13.159
and so for that reason yeah you probably
 

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:15.849
and so for that reason yeah you probably
can make it work with an async task but

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:15.859
can make it work with an async task but
 

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:19.509
can make it work with an async task but
our usual advice is not to Alex did you

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:19.519
our usual advice is not to Alex did you
 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:20.830
our usual advice is not to Alex did you
have anything else you want to add on

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840
have anything else you want to add on
 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.610
have anything else you want to add on
with that sure um just really quickly to

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620
with that sure um just really quickly to
 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.439
with that sure um just really quickly to
like to address the part of the question

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:26.449
like to address the part of the question
 

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:29.710
like to address the part of the question
recess is one async task for all calls

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720
recess is one async task for all calls
 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.399
recess is one async task for all calls
okay or should I use you know what spin

00:03:33.399 --> 00:03:33.409
okay or should I use you know what spin
 

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:36.399
okay or should I use you know what spin
up a new async task per call and I think

00:03:36.399 --> 00:03:36.409
up a new async task per call and I think
 

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:39.819
up a new async task per call and I think
if you're in a situation where you have

if you're in a situation where you have
 

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:42.520
if you're in a situation where you have
a lot of calls happening like let's say

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530
a lot of calls happening like let's say
 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.559
a lot of calls happening like let's say

that's going to take a significant

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340
that's going to take a significant
 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.550
that's going to take a significant
amount of time or if you have a whole

bunch of different tasks that you're
 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.420
bunch of different tasks that you're
queuing up like that the best option is

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430
queuing up like that the best option is
 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.070
queuing up like that the best option is
really to have a background rather just

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:22.080
really to have a background rather just
 

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:23.960
really to have a background rather just
sort of sleeps in waits for new commands

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970
sort of sleeps in waits for new commands
 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.150
sort of sleeps in waits for new commands
and then you can just send those you

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160
and then you can just send those you
 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.560
and then you can just send those you
know send a request for a file or

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570
know send a request for a file or
 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:28.700

UI thread and background threads I would
 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:51.020

development do you recommend reading the

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:01.970
development do you recommend reading the
 

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:04.120
development do you recommend reading the
API guide straight through that's what

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:04.130
API guide straight through that's what
 

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:05.980

one yeah reading the API guides is

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:17.660
one yeah reading the API guides is
 

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:18.880
one yeah reading the API guides is
actually a good way to become familiar

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:18.890
actually a good way to become familiar
 

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:21.460
actually a good way to become familiar
with Android development I should say

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:21.470
with Android development I should say
 

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:23.800
with Android development I should say
that they are the API guides and Android

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:23.810
that they are the API guides and Android
 

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:26.410
that they are the API guides and Android
training serve two separate purposes the

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:26.420
training serve two separate purposes the
 

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:28.180
training serve two separate purposes the
API guides are more designed for a

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:28.190
API guides are more designed for a
 

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:29.830
API guides are more designed for a
particular topic to give you an overview

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:29.840
particular topic to give you an overview
 

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:31.660
particular topic to give you an overview
of the API and all the little features

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:31.670
of the API and all the little features
 

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:33.760
of the API and all the little features
and Method calls and the important

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:33.770
and Method calls and the important
 

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:36.160
and Method calls and the important
elements of it the Android training

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:36.170
elements of it the Android training
 

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:38.590
elements of it the Android training
classes are more task oriented in terms

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:38.600
classes are more task oriented in terms

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:06.290
yeah the API guides are really good
 

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:09.910
yeah the API guides are really good
reading I would recommend instead of

00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:09.920
reading I would recommend instead of
 

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:12.280
reading I would recommend instead of
just reading which doesn't do a lot for

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:12.290
just reading which doesn't do a lot for
 

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:13.750
just reading which doesn't do a lot for
retention of a topic especially

then from there you can go and read the
 

00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:50.440
then from there you can go and read the
individual sections as you come across

00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:50.450
individual sections as you come across
 

00:10:50.450 --> 00:10:51.670
individual sections as you come across
problems you'd like to solve but yeah I

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:51.680
problems you'd like to solve but yeah I
 

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:52.900
problems you'd like to solve but yeah I
do agree with Jeff reading that

00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:52.910
do agree with Jeff reading that
 

00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:54.610

everything on there is a pretty daunting
 

00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:56.650
everything on there is a pretty daunting
task and it's not structured to really

00:10:56.650 --> 00:10:56.660
task and it's not structured to really
 

00:10:56.660 --> 00:10:59.560

succinct shared preferences and we were

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:32.970
succinct shared preferences and we were
 

00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:34.430
succinct shared preferences and we were
told that if we just waited a few weeks

00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:34.440
told that if we just waited a few weeks
 

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:36.380

00:12:13.770 --> 00:12:18.470
building Android applications that use
web api's that would make sense yeah I

00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:18.480
web api's that would make sense yeah I
 

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:20.480

surprise me that we don't know about it

00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:40.350
surprise me that we don't know about it
 

00:12:40.350 --> 00:12:42.019

and try and recap all the questions we

00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:56.370
and try and recap all the questions we
 

00:12:56.370 --> 00:12:58.100
and try and recap all the questions we
can't answer to being the show the

post a actually probably this isn't the

00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:07.560
post a actually probably this isn't the
 

00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:08.930
post a actually probably this isn't the
best question for Stack Overflow so yeah

00:13:08.930 --> 00:13:08.940
best question for Stack Overflow so yeah
 

00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:11.519
best question for Stack Overflow so yeah
yeah so tune in next week will

00:13:11.519 --> 00:13:11.529
yeah so tune in next week will
 

00:13:11.529 --> 00:13:13.590
yeah so tune in next week will
and have some more info and you had

00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:13.600
and have some more info and you had
 

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:16.889
and have some more info and you had
another question yeah the the second

00:13:16.889 --> 00:13:16.899
another question yeah the the second
 

00:13:16.899 --> 00:13:18.929
another question yeah the the second
question is involving fragment

00:13:18.929 --> 00:13:18.939
question is involving fragment
 

00:13:18.939 --> 00:13:21.410
question is involving fragment
transactions with compatibility library

00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:21.420

00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:25.170
transactions with compatibility library
I have basically a linear layout that

00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:25.180
I have basically a linear layout that
 

00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:29.309
I have basically a linear layout that
contains multiple fragments and what I

00:13:29.309 --> 00:13:29.319
contains multiple fragments and what I
 

00:13:29.319 --> 00:13:32.369
contains multiple fragments and what I
want to be able to do is replace one of

00:13:32.369 --> 00:13:32.379
want to be able to do is replace one of
 

00:13:32.379 --> 00:13:36.809
want to be able to do is replace one of
them with another fragment and because I

00:13:36.809 --> 00:13:36.819
them with another fragment and because I
 

00:13:36.819 --> 00:13:39.239
them with another fragment and because I
don't know at the time of replacement if

00:13:39.239 --> 00:13:39.249
don't know at the time of replacement if
 

00:13:39.249 --> 00:13:41.489
don't know at the time of replacement if
the number is identical or not so I just

00:13:41.489 --> 00:13:41.499
the number is identical or not so I just
 

00:13:41.499 --> 00:13:44.309
the number is identical or not so I just
completely erased the row and refill it

00:13:44.309 --> 00:13:44.319
completely erased the row and refill it
 

00:13:44.319 --> 00:13:47.610
completely erased the row and refill it
with fragments the removal process works

00:13:47.610 --> 00:13:47.620
with fragments the removal process works
 

00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:51.749
with fragments the removal process works
great the problem is so I remove all the

00:13:51.749 --> 00:13:51.759
great the problem is so I remove all the
 

00:13:51.759 --> 00:13:53.790
great the problem is so I remove all the
fragments I commit that change and then

00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:53.800
fragments I commit that change and then
 

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:55.889
fragments I commit that change and then
I try and add new fragments and nothing

00:13:55.889 --> 00:13:55.899
I try and add new fragments and nothing
 

00:13:55.899 --> 00:13:59.770
I try and add new fragments and nothing
happens

00:13:59.770 --> 00:13:59.780
 
 

00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:02.110
 
do you commit the change of adding the

00:14:02.110 --> 00:14:02.120
do you commit the change of adding the
 

00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:03.460
do you commit the change of adding the
fragments yes

00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:03.470
fragments yes
 

00:14:03.470 --> 00:14:07.300
fragments yes
yeah it's in within one function i

00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:07.310
yeah it's in within one function i
 

00:14:07.310 --> 00:14:09.430
yeah it's in within one function i
iterate through all the fragments that

00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:09.440
iterate through all the fragments that
 

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:12.310
iterate through all the fragments that
are stored in that layout calling remove

00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:12.320
are stored in that layout calling remove
 

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:15.790
are stored in that layout calling remove
on each one I commit that and then on

00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:15.800
on each one I commit that and then on
 

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:17.800
on each one I commit that and then on
all the fragments that I want to add to

00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:17.810
all the fragments that I want to add to
 

00:14:17.810 --> 00:14:21.430
all the fragments that I want to add to
that row I do an ADD and then commit

00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:21.440
that row I do an ADD and then commit
 

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:29.800
that row I do an ADD and then commit
that after the for loop I'm very

00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:29.810
that after the for loop I'm very
 

00:14:29.810 --> 00:14:33.040
that after the for loop I'm very
confused because I I don't get any log

00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:33.050
confused because I I don't get any log
 

00:14:33.050 --> 00:14:38.920
confused because I I don't get any log
cat messages yeah literally nothing

00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:38.930
cat messages yeah literally nothing
 

00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:39.820
cat messages yeah literally nothing
other than that eh

00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:39.830
other than that eh
 

00:14:39.830 --> 00:14:42.700
other than that eh
I see the results of the removal but I

00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:42.710
I see the results of the removal but I
 

00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:46.960
I see the results of the removal but I
don't get the residuals of the add does

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:46.970
don't get the residuals of the add does
 

00:14:46.970 --> 00:14:50.470
don't get the residuals of the add does
it doesn't work if you add we add them

00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:50.480
it doesn't work if you add we add them
 

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:53.050
it doesn't work if you add we add them
in a separate way like if you do the

00:14:53.050 --> 00:14:53.060
in a separate way like if you do the
 

00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:54.940
in a separate way like if you do the
removals and the ends of the new

00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:54.950
removals and the ends of the new
 

00:14:54.950 --> 00:14:58.750
removals and the ends of the new
fragments in the same transaction I know

00:14:58.750 --> 00:14:58.760
fragments in the same transaction I know
 

00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:01.030

I tried that that didn't work so I

00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:01.040
I tried that that didn't work so I
 

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:02.950
I tried that that didn't work so I
thought maybe I'm having some sort of an

00:15:02.950 --> 00:15:02.960
thought maybe I'm having some sort of an
 

00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:04.720
thought maybe I'm having some sort of an
issue with that so I put them to two

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:04.730
issue with that so I put them to two
 

00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:06.520
issue with that so I put them to two
separate transactions that doesn't work

00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:06.530
separate transactions that doesn't work
 

00:15:06.530 --> 00:15:08.800

work I have this question posted on

00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:12.350
work I have this question posted on
 

00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:17.440
work I have this question posted on
Stack Overflow but I think we probably

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:17.450
Stack Overflow but I think we probably
 

00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:22.360
Stack Overflow but I think we probably
need to see a code for this so and post

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:22.370
need to see a code for this so and post
 

00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:25.570
need to see a code for this so and post
it in the comment thread on Google+ for

00:15:25.570 --> 00:15:25.580
it in the comment thread on Google+ for
 

00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:28.329
it in the comment thread on Google+ for
this live stream right now we'll go

00:15:28.329 --> 00:15:28.339
this live stream right now we'll go
 

00:15:28.339 --> 00:15:30.220
this live stream right now we'll go
through after the show find your

00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:30.230
through after the show find your
 

00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:31.630
through after the show find your
question and take a look through your

00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:31.640
question and take a look through your
 

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:33.760
question and take a look through your
code yeah because it sounds like what

00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:33.770
code yeah because it sounds like what
 

00:15:33.770 --> 00:15:35.260
code yeah because it sounds like what
you're doing should work it's probably

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:35.270
you're doing should work it's probably
 

00:15:35.270 --> 00:15:37.240
you're doing should work it's probably
something really subtle and so if you

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:37.250
something really subtle and so if you
 

00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:38.740
something really subtle and so if you
post some code we can try and sort that

00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:38.750
post some code we can try and sort that
 

00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:41.560
post some code we can try and sort that
out for you just make sure usually I ask

00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:41.570

right now on Google+ post a link to your
 

00:15:48.830 --> 00:15:49.990
right now on Google+ post a link to your
stack overflow question there and we'll

00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:50.000
stack overflow question there and we'll
 

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.090
stack overflow question there and we'll
find that right this is the advantage

00:15:52.090 --> 00:15:52.100
find that right this is the advantage
 

00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:56.440

best practices on writing a web API that
 

00:16:45.490 --> 00:16:47.370
best practices on writing a web API that
will be interacting with Android are

that will make the Android interactions
 

00:16:53.770 --> 00:16:56.420
that will make the Android interactions
more seamless and that's from the scene

00:16:56.420 --> 00:16:56.430
more seamless and that's from the scene
 

00:16:56.430 --> 00:17:01.410

if you're using xml just to make sure

00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:00.130
if you're using xml just to make sure
 

00:18:00.130 --> 00:18:04.710
if you're using xml just to make sure
that you're using a sax style xml parser

that you're using a sax style xml parser

I'd say JSON tends to be one of the

I'd say JSON tends to be one of the
 

00:18:12.899 --> 00:18:17.090
I'd say JSON tends to be one of the
better JSON parsers available but JSON

00:18:17.090 --> 00:18:17.100
better JSON parsers available but JSON
 

00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:18.379

anyway what are the best practices to
 

00:22:32.810 --> 00:22:36.610
anyway what are the best practices to
keep the key in my Android app safe okay

00:22:36.610 --> 00:22:36.620
keep the key in my Android app safe okay
 

00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:38.830
keep the key in my Android app safe okay
that that's a little bit tougher because

00:22:38.830 --> 00:22:38.840
that that's a little bit tougher because
 

00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:41.890
that that's a little bit tougher because
yeah like you mentioned it's entirely

00:22:41.890 --> 00:22:41.900
yeah like you mentioned it's entirely
 

00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:44.530
yeah like you mentioned it's entirely
possible to decompile an APK and if you

00:22:44.530 --> 00:22:44.540
possible to decompile an APK and if you
 

00:22:44.540 --> 00:22:46.950
possible to decompile an APK and if you
have your private key stored in there

00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:46.960
have your private key stored in there
 

00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:48.880
have your private key stored in there
somebody looking at the byte code will

00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:48.890
somebody looking at the byte code will
 

00:22:48.890 --> 00:22:51.430
somebody looking at the byte code will
be able to find it and remove it so I'd

00:22:51.430 --> 00:22:51.440
be able to find it and remove it so I'd
 

00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:53.770
be able to find it and remove it so I'd
say given that your best option to be

00:22:53.770 --> 00:22:53.780
say given that your best option to be
 

00:22:53.780 --> 00:22:58.210
say given that your best option to be
they escape that key somehow so you know

00:22:58.210 --> 00:22:58.220
they escape that key somehow so you know
 

00:22:58.220 --> 00:23:00.580
they escape that key somehow so you know
just play the easiest way to some you go

00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:00.590
just play the easiest way to some you go
 

00:23:00.590 --> 00:23:01.570
just play the easiest way to some you go
and remove a key if they're gonna try

00:23:01.570 --> 00:23:01.580
and remove a key if they're gonna try
 

00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:04.210
and remove a key if they're gonna try
and do it would be to just one strings

00:23:04.210 --> 00:23:04.220
and do it would be to just one strings
 

00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:06.520
and do it would be to just one strings
on your cono on your app and see what

00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:06.530
on your cono on your app and see what
 

00:23:06.530 --> 00:23:09.000
on your cono on your app and see what
strings are contained in there so

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:09.010
strings are contained in there so
 

00:23:09.010 --> 00:23:13.290
strings are contained in there so
probably good alternative would be to

00:23:13.290 --> 00:23:13.300
probably good alternative would be to
 

00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:18.820
probably good alternative would be to
create some sort of you know a seed for

00:23:18.820 --> 00:23:18.830
create some sort of you know a seed for
 

00:23:18.830 --> 00:23:21.670
create some sort of you know a seed for
your key and use some cryptographic

00:23:21.670 --> 00:23:21.680
your key and use some cryptographic
 

00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:25.510
your key and use some cryptographic
function to go and convert that into a

00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:25.520
function to go and convert that into a
 

00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:29.470
function to go and convert that into a
suitably sized you know key hey Robert

00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:29.480
suitably sized you know key hey Robert
 

00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:31.890
suitably sized you know key hey Robert
could you meet the speaker sorry

00:23:31.890 --> 00:23:31.900
could you meet the speaker sorry
 

00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:35.530
could you meet the speaker sorry
yeah so yeah basically you know it's the

00:23:35.530 --> 00:23:35.540
yeah so yeah basically you know it's the
 

00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:37.480
yeah so yeah basically you know it's the
same idea like with the passphrase when

00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:37.490
same idea like with the passphrase when
 

00:23:37.490 --> 00:23:39.040
same idea like with the passphrase when
you log into a Wi-Fi network or

00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:39.050
you log into a Wi-Fi network or
 

00:23:39.050 --> 00:23:40.840
you log into a Wi-Fi network or
something like that the past parade used

00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:40.850
something like that the past parade used
 

00:23:40.850 --> 00:23:42.760
something like that the past parade used
the passphrase provided is usually not

00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:42.770
the passphrase provided is usually not
 

00:23:42.770 --> 00:23:45.540
the passphrase provided is usually not
long enough to actually become a

00:23:45.540 --> 00:23:45.550
long enough to actually become a
 

00:23:45.550 --> 00:23:48.580
long enough to actually become a
suitable cryptographic key so there's

00:23:48.580 --> 00:23:48.590
suitable cryptographic key so there's
 

00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:49.720
suitable cryptographic key so there's
various algorithms actually go and

00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:49.730
various algorithms actually go and
 

00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:51.310
various algorithms actually go and
extend that into you know some this is

00:23:51.310 --> 00:23:51.320
extend that into you know some this is
 

00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:54.160
extend that into you know some this is
512 or however many bytes as long as you

00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:54.170
512 or however many bytes as long as you
 

00:23:54.170 --> 00:23:58.090
512 or however many bytes as long as you
need for your actual key material a good

00:23:58.090 --> 00:23:58.100
need for your actual key material a good
 

00:23:58.100 --> 00:24:01.150
need for your actual key material a good
example of this try to remember the name

00:24:01.150 --> 00:24:01.160
example of this try to remember the name
 

00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:02.169
example of this try to remember the name
of the algorithm

00:24:02.169 --> 00:24:02.179
of the algorithm
 

00:24:02.179 --> 00:24:04.210
of the algorithm
I don't think it'd be here remember it's

00:24:04.210 --> 00:24:04.220
I don't think it'd be here remember it's
 

00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:07.409
I don't think it'd be here remember it's
off the top date their heads do they

00:24:07.409 --> 00:24:07.419
 
 

00:24:07.419 --> 00:24:10.509
 
give us a better hint yeah it's not

00:24:10.509 --> 00:24:10.519
give us a better hint yeah it's not
 

00:24:10.519 --> 00:24:12.009
give us a better hint yeah it's not
rhythm that converts a passphrase into a

00:24:12.009 --> 00:24:12.019
rhythm that converts a passphrase into a
 

00:24:12.019 --> 00:24:17.049
rhythm that converts a passphrase into a
longer key no I think we probably have

00:24:17.049 --> 00:24:17.059
longer key no I think we probably have
 

00:24:17.059 --> 00:24:21.220
longer key no I think we probably have
to look it up jack but anyway if you

00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:21.230
to look it up jack but anyway if you
 

00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:22.720
to look it up jack but anyway if you
take a look out there there are our gums

00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:22.730
take a look out there there are our gums
 

00:24:22.730 --> 00:24:25.749
take a look out there there are our gums
that basically will extend a passphrase

00:24:25.749 --> 00:24:25.759
that basically will extend a passphrase
 

00:24:25.759 --> 00:24:28.600
that basically will extend a passphrase
into something larger and that would be

00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:28.610
into something larger and that would be
 

00:24:28.610 --> 00:24:30.850
into something larger and that would be
a good way to go and hide your key

00:24:30.850 --> 00:24:30.860
a good way to go and hide your key
 

00:24:30.860 --> 00:24:35.980
a good way to go and hide your key
alternatively if you I guess you could

00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:35.990
alternatively if you I guess you could
 

00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:38.560
alternatively if you I guess you could
even use them like md5 workshop or sha-1

00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:38.570
even use them like md5 workshop or sha-1
 

00:24:38.570 --> 00:24:41.619
even use them like md5 workshop or sha-1
just get generate a hash of your key and

00:24:41.619 --> 00:24:41.629
just get generate a hash of your key and
 

00:24:41.629 --> 00:24:43.450
just get generate a hash of your key and
then basically that that's where he

00:24:43.450 --> 00:24:43.460
then basically that that's where he
 

00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:44.440
then basically that that's where he
wants to be goes and looks at the

00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:44.450
wants to be goes and looks at the
 

00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:47.710
wants to be goes and looks at the
strings they're not seeing your verbatim

00:24:47.710 --> 00:24:47.720
strings they're not seeing your verbatim
 

00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:49.330
strings they're not seeing your verbatim
key stored in there now I do want to

00:24:49.330 --> 00:24:49.340
key stored in there now I do want to
 

00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:50.799
key stored in there now I do want to
caution there is there is some advice

00:24:50.799 --> 00:24:50.809
caution there is there is some advice
 

00:24:50.809 --> 00:24:52.359
caution there is there is some advice
out there that I want you not to follow

00:24:52.359 --> 00:24:52.369
out there that I want you not to follow
 

00:24:52.369 --> 00:24:57.129
out there that I want you not to follow
and that is don't use secure random to

00:24:57.129 --> 00:24:57.139
and that is don't use secure random to
 

00:24:57.139 --> 00:25:00.039
and that is don't use secure random to
generate your key fill material so what

00:25:00.039 --> 00:25:00.049
generate your key fill material so what
 

00:25:00.049 --> 00:25:01.389
generate your key fill material so what
I usually see people do in this case is

00:25:01.389 --> 00:25:01.399
I usually see people do in this case is
 

00:25:01.399 --> 00:25:03.039
I usually see people do in this case is
logo and create instance of secure

00:25:03.039 --> 00:25:03.049
logo and create instance of secure
 

00:25:03.049 --> 00:25:05.769
logo and create instance of secure
random generator feed their passphrase

00:25:05.769 --> 00:25:05.779
random generator feed their passphrase
 

00:25:05.779 --> 00:25:07.989
random generator feed their passphrase
essentially and is their random seed and

00:25:07.989 --> 00:25:07.999
essentially and is their random seed and
 

00:25:07.999 --> 00:25:10.509
essentially and is their random seed and
then generate however many bytes of

00:25:10.509 --> 00:25:10.519
then generate however many bytes of
 

00:25:10.519 --> 00:25:12.909
then generate however many bytes of
random data assuming that since they're

00:25:12.909 --> 00:25:12.919
random data assuming that since they're
 

00:25:12.919 --> 00:25:14.649
random data assuming that since they're
always using the same seed they'll

00:25:14.649 --> 00:25:14.659
always using the same seed they'll
 

00:25:14.659 --> 00:25:16.269
always using the same seed they'll
always get the same random data back out

00:25:16.269 --> 00:25:16.279
always get the same random data back out
 

00:25:16.279 --> 00:25:19.419
always get the same random data back out
and the the actual answer is that is not

00:25:19.419 --> 00:25:19.429
and the the actual answer is that is not
 

00:25:19.429 --> 00:25:21.909
and the the actual answer is that is not
guaranteed to happen and I have seen

00:25:21.909 --> 00:25:21.919
guaranteed to happen and I have seen
 

00:25:21.919 --> 00:25:23.769
guaranteed to happen and I have seen

00:25:23.779 --> 00:25:25.690
some apps break pretty badly because of
this assumption so please please please

00:25:25.690 --> 00:25:25.700
this assumption so please please please
 

00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:27.700

development access and to do that you

00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:32.610
development access and to do that you
 

00:26:32.610 --> 00:26:34.940
development access and to do that you
need a custom ROM so Android normally

00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:34.950
need a custom ROM so Android normally
 

00:26:34.950 --> 00:26:37.070

user build which is what you'll find on
 

00:26:38.910 --> 00:26:41.510

then there's also a user debug build in
 

00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:46.790
then there's also a user debug build in
an inch build which enable increasing

levels of access of the system at the
 

00:26:49.470 --> 00:26:51.440
levels of access of the system at the
cost of performance and security we

way to do this either I I don't think
there's a way even if there is just

00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:11.130
there's a way even if there is just
 

00:30:11.130 --> 00:30:13.010
there's a way even if there is just
speaking as easier I don't know that I

00:30:13.010 --> 00:30:13.020
speaking as easier I don't know that I
 

00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:15.200
speaking as easier I don't know that I
would like that experience where the

00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:15.210
would like that experience where the
 

00:30:15.210 --> 00:30:16.730
would like that experience where the
thing that I'm dragging is sort of

00:30:16.730 --> 00:30:16.740
thing that I'm dragging is sort of
 

00:30:16.740 --> 00:30:18.789
thing that I'm dragging is sort of
following my finger but sort of not I

00:30:18.789 --> 00:30:18.799
following my finger but sort of not I
 

00:30:18.799 --> 00:30:21.260
following my finger but sort of not I
think it's it's pretty intuitive if

00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:21.270
think it's it's pretty intuitive if
 

00:30:21.270 --> 00:30:22.639
think it's it's pretty intuitive if
you're dragging a ListView and around

00:30:22.639 --> 00:30:22.649
you're dragging a ListView and around
 

00:30:22.649 --> 00:30:25.430
you're dragging a ListView and around
that you can only drag it to other areas

00:30:25.430 --> 00:30:25.440
that you can only drag it to other areas
 

00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:28.669
that you can only drag it to other areas
in the list so I would I would leave

00:30:28.669 --> 00:30:28.679
in the list so I would I would leave
 

00:30:28.679 --> 00:30:32.659
in the list so I would I would leave
that as is I am I kind of understand the

00:30:32.659 --> 00:30:32.669
that as is I am I kind of understand the
 

00:30:32.669 --> 00:30:34.850
that as is I am I kind of understand the
question because there's a gesture in

00:30:34.850 --> 00:30:34.860
question because there's a gesture in
 

00:30:34.860 --> 00:30:38.539
question because there's a gesture in
like Mac or Windows where you say hold

00:30:38.539 --> 00:30:38.549
like Mac or Windows where you say hold
 

00:30:38.549 --> 00:30:41.000
like Mac or Windows where you say hold
down the shift key and move the cursor

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:41.010
down the shift key and move the cursor
 

00:30:41.010 --> 00:30:45.350
down the shift key and move the cursor
or use a cursor arrow and that restrains

00:30:45.350 --> 00:30:45.360
or use a cursor arrow and that restrains
 

00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:47.480
or use a cursor arrow and that restrains
the movement to one axis rather than

00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:47.490
the movement to one axis rather than
 

00:30:47.490 --> 00:30:49.909
the movement to one axis rather than
moving it all over the screen but um I

00:30:49.909 --> 00:30:49.919
moving it all over the screen but um I
 

00:30:49.919 --> 00:30:52.310
moving it all over the screen but um I
don't think that's as necessary on an

00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:52.320
don't think that's as necessary on an
 

00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:55.490
don't think that's as necessary on an

right through location so I just don't

00:31:00.730 --> 00:31:00.740
right through location so I just don't
 

00:31:00.740 --> 00:31:05.669
right through location so I just don't
think that the current API supports that

00:31:05.679 --> 00:31:10.360

such large responses excellent question

00:33:02.350 --> 00:33:02.360
such large responses excellent question

such large responses excellent question
so if you control the API you could go

00:33:06.850 --> 00:33:06.860
so if you control the API you could go
 

00:33:06.860 --> 00:33:09.010
so if you control the API you could go
and page your responses so that way you

00:33:09.010 --> 00:33:09.020
and page your responses so that way you
 

00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:12.670
and page your responses so that way you

what has mentioned earlier about DOM
 

00:33:23.690 --> 00:33:27.640
what has mentioned earlier about DOM
versus sax in the context of XML Dom you

00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:27.650
versus sax in the context of XML Dom you
 

00:33:27.650 --> 00:33:29.410
versus sax in the context of XML Dom you
actually go and load the entire

generate events to come across certain
elements but at no point you have to go

elements but at no point you have to go
 

00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:41.830
elements but at no point you have to go
and load the entire tree into memory and

and load the entire tree into memory and
so if you're finding that you are

00:33:44.700 --> 00:33:44.710
so if you're finding that you are
 

00:33:44.710 --> 00:33:46.720
so if you're finding that you are
encountering similar problems in JSON

00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:46.730
encountering similar problems in JSON
 

00:33:46.730 --> 00:33:49.240
encountering similar problems in JSON
and JSON really is a lot most JSON

00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:49.250
and JSON really is a lot most JSON
 

00:33:49.250 --> 00:33:51.100
and JSON really is a lot most JSON
parsers work a lot similarly to how a

you know I I'm not familiar with these

00:33:57.340 --> 00:33:57.350
you know I I'm not familiar with these
 

00:33:57.350 --> 00:33:59.200
you know I I'm not familiar with these
streaming JSON parsers there's got to be

own that literally just scans through
 

00:34:05.630 --> 00:34:08.440
own that literally just scans through
the XML or sorry through the JSON data

00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:08.450

00:34:10.660 --> 00:34:10.670
and emits events when it comes across
 

00:34:10.670 --> 00:34:12.070
and emits events when it comes across
certain apps and you can use that to

00:34:12.070 --> 00:34:12.080
certain apps and you can use that to
 

00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:16.060
certain apps and you can use that to
extract the data you need so yeah we say

00:34:16.060 --> 00:34:16.070
extract the data you need so yeah we say
 

00:34:16.070 --> 00:34:19.090
extract the data you need so yeah we say
that each element within your your JSON

00:34:19.090 --> 00:34:19.100
that each element within your your JSON
 

00:34:19.100 --> 00:34:22.510
that each element within your your JSON
tree has a title a URL and another you

00:34:22.510 --> 00:34:22.520
tree has a title a URL and another you

know few hundred K worth of data just

00:34:24.310 --> 00:34:24.320
know few hundred K worth of data just

using extreme example you know you can

00:34:26.170 --> 00:34:26.180
using extreme example you know you can
 

00:34:26.180 --> 00:34:27.970
using extreme example you know you can
just go and extract the URL in the title

00:34:27.970 --> 00:34:27.980
just go and extract the URL in the title
 

00:34:27.980 --> 00:34:29.680
just go and extract the URL in the title
and then when the user clicks on it you

00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:29.690
and then when the user clicks on it you
 

00:34:29.690 --> 00:34:31.090
and then when the user clicks on it you
could go and make a call that you are

00:34:31.090 --> 00:34:31.100
could go and make a call that you are
 

00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:34.480
could go and make a call that you are
all to fetch the additional data

00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:34.490
all to fetch the additional data
 

00:34:34.490 --> 00:34:36.760
all to fetch the additional data
at request and that way you can ease up

00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:36.770

good streaming json parser but as far as
 

00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:18.730

the size of a large photo right I'll

actually a mega I could be a small photo

actually a mega I could be a small photo

actually a mega I could be a small photo
but anyway I mean I'd say up to that

but anyway I mean I'd say up to that
 

00:37:04.490 --> 00:37:06.820
but anyway I mean I'd say up to that
size you're probably still safe so if

you're running out of memory with
paragraphs that's that sort of tells me

00:37:12.700 --> 00:37:12.710
paragraphs that's that sort of tells me
 

00:37:12.710 --> 00:37:14.260
paragraphs that's that sort of tells me
that there's something else wrong in

that there's something else wrong in
 

00:37:14.270 --> 00:37:16.630
that there's something else wrong in
your app and you're just I'm really

00:37:16.630 --> 00:37:16.640
your app and you're just I'm really
 

00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:18.370
your app and you're just I'm really
curious well on what your app is using

00:37:18.370 --> 00:37:18.380
curious well on what your app is using
 

00:37:18.380 --> 00:37:20.440

up all available memory but I'd expect

00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:20.450
up all available memory but I'd expect
 

00:37:20.450 --> 00:37:21.970
up all available memory but I'd expect
you to be running into other problems

00:37:21.970 --> 00:37:21.980
you to be running into other problems
 

00:37:21.980 --> 00:37:23.680
you to be running into other problems
just besides your JSON at that point I

00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:23.690
just besides your JSON at that point I
 

00:37:23.690 --> 00:37:25.480
just besides your JSON at that point I

yeah it's there's a lot of of UI going

00:38:18.940 --> 00:38:18.950
yeah it's there's a lot of of UI going
 

00:38:18.950 --> 00:38:21.759
yeah it's there's a lot of of UI going
on there's there's we've got other

the system and this it's it's entirely

the system and this it's it's entirely
 

00:38:27.019 --> 00:38:29.650
the system and this it's it's entirely
possible that this is just a large

00:38:29.650 --> 00:38:29.660
possible that this is just a large
 

00:38:29.660 --> 00:38:32.559
possible that this is just a large
enough hit into the system that it's

00:38:32.559 --> 00:38:32.569
enough hit into the system that it's
 

00:38:32.569 --> 00:38:35.400
enough hit into the system that it's
just it's just taking us over the top

00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:35.410
just it's just taking us over the top
 

00:38:35.410 --> 00:38:39.069
just it's just taking us over the top
but we don't experience this this out of

00:38:39.069 --> 00:38:39.079
but we don't experience this this out of
 

00:38:39.079 --> 00:38:41.559
but we don't experience this this out of
memory in any other area except when

00:38:41.559 --> 00:38:41.569

00:38:41.569 --> 00:38:47.200

we're loading up this Jason hmm yeah

00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:47.210
we're loading up this Jason hmm yeah
 

00:38:47.210 --> 00:38:50.280
we're loading up this Jason hmm yeah
this is that just an interesting problem

00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:50.290
this is that just an interesting problem
 

00:38:50.290 --> 00:38:52.650
this is that just an interesting problem
so if you do have if you if you are able

00:38:52.650 --> 00:38:52.660
so if you do have if you if you are able
 

00:38:52.660 --> 00:38:55.160
so if you do have if you if you are able
to find a streaming jsonparser

00:38:55.160 --> 00:38:55.170
to find a streaming jsonparser
 

00:38:55.170 --> 00:38:57.690
to find a streaming jsonparser
time for you I think that's probably the

00:38:57.690 --> 00:38:57.700
time for you I think that's probably the
 

00:38:57.700 --> 00:38:59.910
time for you I think that's probably the
best approach here given that any like

00:38:59.910 --> 00:38:59.920
best approach here given that any like
 

00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:01.980
best approach here given that any like
it's entirely possible to that I'm just

00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:01.990
it's entirely possible to that I'm just
 

00:39:01.990 --> 00:39:03.270
it's entirely possible to that I'm just
guessing maybe you occasion when I

00:39:03.270 --> 00:39:03.280
guessing maybe you occasion when I
 

00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:05.280
guessing maybe you occasion when I
crossed a really adapt normally large

you're having is very similar to loading

00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:10.930
you're having is very similar to loading
 

00:39:10.930 --> 00:39:13.230

00:39:13.230 --> 00:39:13.240
bitmaps from the internet and Vick naps
 

00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:16.260
bitmaps from the internet and Vick naps
are are fairly large the advice we

00:39:16.260 --> 00:39:16.270
are are fairly large the advice we
 

00:39:16.270 --> 00:39:17.940
are are fairly large the advice we
usually give is there's enough space to

00:39:17.940 --> 00:39:17.950
usually give is there's enough space to
 

00:39:17.950 --> 00:39:21.450
usually give is there's enough space to
load twice your screen size in the Java

00:39:21.450 --> 00:39:21.460
load twice your screen size in the Java
 

00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:26.820
load twice your screen size in the Java
heap and you know any reasonably sized

00:39:26.820 --> 00:39:26.830
heap and you know any reasonably sized
 

00:39:26.830 --> 00:39:28.230
heap and you know any reasonably sized

00:39:28.230 --> 00:39:28.240
blockage a someday there's gonna be less
 

00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:32.550
blockage a someday there's gonna be less
than that so yeah you're probably are

00:39:32.550 --> 00:39:32.560
than that so yeah you're probably are
 

00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:34.020
than that so yeah you're probably are
just too right at the edge there but

00:39:34.020 --> 00:39:34.030
just too right at the edge there but
 

00:39:34.030 --> 00:39:35.670
just too right at the edge there but
we'll see we can find that that can help

00:39:35.670 --> 00:39:35.680
we'll see we can find that that can help
 

00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:40.650
we'll see we can find that that can help
how about this we don't know we're using

00:39:40.650 --> 00:39:40.660
how about this we don't know we're using
 

00:39:40.660 --> 00:39:43.940
how about this we don't know we're using

that Android is very close to being
 

00:40:34.190 --> 00:40:37.450

feature complete but why does it seem

00:40:37.450 --> 00:40:37.460
feature complete but why does it seem
 

00:40:37.460 --> 00:40:40.150
feature complete but why does it seem
like not enough effort is put on html5

00:40:40.150 --> 00:40:40.160

statement that I yeah we can't talk
 

00:41:26.690 --> 00:41:28.329
statement that I yeah we can't talk
about on the air but I mean these are

00:41:28.329 --> 00:41:28.339
about on the air but I mean these are
 

00:41:28.339 --> 00:41:31.089
about on the air but I mean these are
all good points and we definitely listen

00:41:31.089 --> 00:41:31.099
all good points and we definitely listen
 

00:41:31.099 --> 00:41:32.109
all good points and we definitely listen

to the feedback from the community and
 

00:41:32.119 --> 00:41:35.109
to the feedback from the community and
deciding how we spend our engineering

00:41:35.109 --> 00:41:35.119
deciding how we spend our engineering
 

00:41:35.119 --> 00:41:38.170
deciding how we spend our engineering
time so I'll just take this question is

00:41:38.170 --> 00:41:38.180
time so I'll just take this question is
 

00:41:38.180 --> 00:41:41.559
time so I'll just take this question is
a feature request and make sure that

00:41:41.559 --> 00:41:41.569
a feature request and make sure that
 

00:41:41.569 --> 00:41:44.220
a feature request and make sure that
that gets passed along

00:41:44.220 --> 00:41:44.230
that gets passed along
 

00:41:44.230 --> 00:41:53.160
that gets passed along
okay

00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:21.300
 
okay so the question is on is there a

00:42:21.300 --> 00:42:21.310
okay so the question is on is there a
 

00:42:21.310 --> 00:42:24.570
okay so the question is on is there a
way is there a way of adjusting the

00:42:24.570 --> 00:42:24.580
way is there a way of adjusting the
 

00:42:24.580 --> 00:42:29.340
way is there a way of adjusting the
padding on the label for the spinner so

00:42:29.340 --> 00:42:29.350
padding on the label for the spinner so
 

00:42:29.350 --> 00:42:31.350
padding on the label for the spinner so
on the text within the spinner I guess

00:42:31.350 --> 00:42:31.360
on the text within the spinner I guess
 

00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:32.730

this better I see okay so the question

00:42:36.870 --> 00:42:36.880
this better I see okay so the question
 

00:42:36.880 --> 00:42:39.510
this better I see okay so the question
is how do I left the line text within

00:42:39.510 --> 00:42:39.520
is how do I left the line text within
 

00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:44.010
is how do I left the line text within
the spinner itself right okay I don't

00:42:44.010 --> 00:42:44.020
the spinner itself right okay I don't
 

00:42:44.020 --> 00:42:45.390
the spinner itself right okay I don't
know the answer to that off the top of

00:42:45.390 --> 00:42:45.400

00:45:48.770 --> 00:45:48.780
client libraries are out there if you
 

00:45:48.780 --> 00:45:50.569
client libraries are out there if you
are writing new API is please these rest

00:45:50.569 --> 00:45:50.579
are writing new API is please these rest
 

00:45:50.579 --> 00:45:53.410

go and speed up SSL and TLS and so you

00:47:45.089 --> 00:47:45.099
go and speed up SSL and TLS and so you
 

00:47:45.099 --> 00:47:47.279
go and speed up SSL and TLS and so you
could use a I imagine there's probably a

there's a way to go and get that working
but most servers out there I don't think

00:47:58.469 --> 00:47:58.479
but most servers out there I don't think

use case and get really nice results but
 

00:49:36.039 --> 00:49:37.709
use case and get really nice results but
I think that the beauty of rest is is

00:49:37.709 --> 00:49:37.719
I think that the beauty of rest is is
 

00:49:37.719 --> 00:49:39.130
I think that the beauty of rest is is
designed to be very easy to use

00:49:39.130 --> 00:49:39.140
designed to be very easy to use
 

00:49:39.140 --> 00:49:42.130
designed to be very easy to use
without a client library so I think

00:49:42.130 --> 00:49:42.140
without a client library so I think
 

00:49:42.140 --> 00:49:46.900
without a client library so I think
there is there's a case in writing

00:49:46.900 --> 00:49:46.910
there is there's a case in writing
 

00:49:46.910 --> 00:49:48.430
there is there's a case in writing
client libraries in a service by service

00:49:48.430 --> 00:49:48.440
client libraries in a service by service
 

00:49:48.440 --> 00:49:52.420
client libraries in a service by service
basis so say you want to talk to just

00:49:52.420 --> 00:49:52.430

pulling an example off the top of my

head say you want to talk to Google

00:49:54.610 --> 00:49:54.620
head say you want to talk to Google
 

00:49:54.620 --> 00:49:56.590

Cloud messaging right it would make

00:49:56.590 --> 00:49:56.600
Cloud messaging right it would make
 

00:49:56.600 --> 00:49:58.090
Cloud messaging right it would make
sense to write a Google Cloud messaging

00:49:58.090 --> 00:49:58.100
sense to write a Google Cloud messaging
 

00:49:58.100 --> 00:49:59.740
sense to write a Google Cloud messaging
library that knows all the intricacies

00:49:59.740 --> 00:49:59.750
library that knows all the intricacies
 

00:49:59.750 --> 00:50:02.350
library that knows all the intricacies
of that service and then marshals your

00:50:02.350 --> 00:50:02.360
of that service and then marshals your
 

00:50:02.360 --> 00:50:03.790
of that service and then marshals your
HTTP requests for you and makes

00:50:03.790 --> 00:50:03.800
HTTP requests for you and makes
 

00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:05.710
HTTP requests for you and makes
everything very clean you never have to

00:50:05.710 --> 00:50:05.720
everything very clean you never have to
 

00:50:05.720 --> 00:50:07.930
everything very clean you never have to
know the the raw protocol I think that's

00:50:07.930 --> 00:50:07.940
know the the raw protocol I think that's
 

00:50:07.940 --> 00:50:10.150
know the the raw protocol I think that's
that's a valid effort but I think trying

00:50:10.150 --> 00:50:10.160
that's a valid effort but I think trying
 

00:50:10.160 --> 00:50:12.820
that's a valid effort but I think trying
to make a very generic rest client

00:50:12.820 --> 00:50:12.830
to make a very generic rest client
 

00:50:12.830 --> 00:50:15.220
to make a very generic rest client
library you wind up letting something

00:50:15.220 --> 00:50:15.230
library you wind up letting something
 

00:50:15.230 --> 00:50:16.570
library you wind up letting something
that looks exactly like an HTTP client

00:50:16.570 --> 00:50:16.580
that looks exactly like an HTTP client
 

00:50:16.580 --> 00:50:20.290
that looks exactly like an HTTP client
library but more like more more likely

00:50:20.290 --> 00:50:20.300
library but more like more more likely
 

00:50:20.300 --> 00:50:21.670
library but more like more more likely
than not adding a lot of complexity on

00:50:21.670 --> 00:50:21.680
than not adding a lot of complexity on
 

00:50:21.680 --> 00:50:23.650
than not adding a lot of complexity on
top of it so I'm not convinced there's a

00:50:23.650 --> 00:50:23.660
top of it so I'm not convinced there's a
 

00:50:23.660 --> 00:50:26.380
top of it so I'm not convinced there's a
lot of benefit there if you do have to

00:50:26.380 --> 00:50:26.390
lot of benefit there if you do have to
 

00:50:26.390 --> 00:50:27.760
lot of benefit there if you do have to
know any really good client libraries

00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:27.770
know any really good client libraries
 

00:50:27.770 --> 00:50:29.260
know any really good client libraries

00:50:29.270 --> 00:50:30.550
for doing this let me know I'd love to
take a look at them because it is

something broken you fix it um but I
 

00:51:17.960 --> 00:51:19.809

would google it too and see if there's

would be epic unfortunately if we played

00:55:21.510 --> 00:55:21.520
would be epic unfortunately if we played
 

00:55:21.520 --> 00:55:27.000
would be epic unfortunately if we played
it over YouTube yeah that's the problem

00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:27.010
it over YouTube yeah that's the problem
 

00:55:27.010 --> 00:55:30.330
it over YouTube yeah that's the problem
with a lot of those piece yeah we have

00:55:30.330 --> 00:55:30.340
with a lot of those piece yeah we have
 

00:55:30.340 --> 00:55:33.470
with a lot of those piece yeah we have
to find something that's freeware

00:55:33.470 --> 00:55:33.480
to find something that's freeware

00:55:45.870 --> 00:55:45.880
create site playing music we're on a
 

00:55:45.880 --> 00:55:49.860
create site playing music we're on a
school and something yeah okay cool I

00:55:49.860 --> 00:55:49.870
school and something yeah okay cool I
 

00:55:49.870 --> 00:55:52.230
school and something yeah okay cool I
try to develop a web service whose data

00:55:52.230 --> 00:55:52.240
try to develop a web service whose data
 

00:55:52.240 --> 00:55:56.610
try to develop a web service whose data
is on a web server and I wonder if local

00:55:56.610 --> 00:55:56.620
is on a web server and I wonder if local
 

00:55:56.620 --> 00:56:02.040
is on a web server and I wonder if local
host was HTTP client okay okay okay so

00:56:02.040 --> 00:56:02.050
host was HTTP client okay okay okay so
 

00:56:02.050 --> 00:56:04.770
host was HTTP client okay okay okay so
your so it's a you're basically trying

00:56:04.770 --> 00:56:04.780
your so it's a you're basically trying
 

00:56:04.780 --> 00:56:10.080
your so it's a you're basically trying
to develop a web a web app that's

00:56:10.080 --> 00:56:10.090
to develop a web a web app that's
 

00:56:10.090 --> 00:56:13.410
to develop a web a web app that's
running on the Android device and then

00:56:13.410 --> 00:56:13.420
running on the Android device and then
 

00:56:13.420 --> 00:56:15.060
running on the Android device and then
accessing a local server running on the

00:56:15.060 --> 00:56:15.070
accessing a local server running on the
 

00:56:15.070 --> 00:56:17.990
accessing a local server running on the
Android device is that that's correct

00:56:17.990 --> 00:56:18.000
Android device is that that's correct
 

00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:21.180
Android device is that that's correct
okay okay that makes sense so yeah I

00:56:21.180 --> 00:56:21.190
okay okay that makes sense so yeah I
 

00:56:21.190 --> 00:56:22.860
okay okay that makes sense so yeah I
think that's actually possible you do

00:56:22.860 --> 00:56:22.870
think that's actually possible you do
 

00:56:22.870 --> 00:56:25.200
think that's actually possible you do
have to request a permission to indicate

00:56:25.200 --> 00:56:25.210
have to request a permission to indicate
 

00:56:25.210 --> 00:56:29.190
have to request a permission to indicate
that you want to run a server I believe

00:56:29.190 --> 00:56:29.200
that you want to run a server I believe
 

00:56:29.200 --> 00:56:31.410
that you want to run a server I believe
and then you just go ahead and open up a

00:56:31.410 --> 00:56:31.420
and then you just go ahead and open up a
 

00:56:31.420 --> 00:56:33.240
and then you just go ahead and open up a
local port there's a lot of other cases

00:56:33.240 --> 00:56:33.250
local port there's a lot of other cases
 

00:56:33.250 --> 00:56:34.700
local port there's a lot of other cases
where that's actually useful for example

00:56:34.700 --> 00:56:34.710
where that's actually useful for example
 

00:56:34.710 --> 00:56:36.870
where that's actually useful for example
for the longest time that used to be a

00:56:36.870 --> 00:56:36.880

recommendation people who are trying to

00:56:38.100 --> 00:56:38.110
recommendation people who are trying to
 

00:56:38.110 --> 00:56:39.390
recommendation people who are trying to
do something really complicated with

00:56:39.390 --> 00:56:39.400
do something really complicated with
 

00:56:39.400 --> 00:56:42.090
do something really complicated with
streaming video and you know DRM and

00:56:42.090 --> 00:56:42.100
streaming video and you know DRM and
 

00:56:42.100 --> 00:56:44.250
streaming video and you know DRM and
things like that is you know run your

00:56:44.250 --> 00:56:44.260
things like that is you know run your
 

00:56:44.260 --> 00:56:46.110
things like that is you know run your
own local server to go and buffer to

00:56:46.110 --> 00:56:46.120
own local server to go and buffer to
 

00:56:46.120 --> 00:56:49.130
own local server to go and buffer to
either be the video stream to the local

00:56:49.130 --> 00:56:49.140
either be the video stream to the local
 

00:56:49.140 --> 00:56:52.710
either be the video stream to the local
media playback system but I mean in your

00:56:52.710 --> 00:56:52.720
media playback system but I mean in your
 

00:56:52.720 --> 00:56:54.020
media playback system but I mean in your
case I think that's entirely possible

00:56:54.020 --> 00:56:54.030
case I think that's entirely possible
 

00:56:54.030 --> 00:56:57.140
case I think that's entirely possible
that being said it is a bit heavy weight

00:56:57.140 --> 00:56:57.150
that being said it is a bit heavy weight
 

00:56:57.150 --> 00:56:59.370
that being said it is a bit heavy weight
you know you have to go and run your web

00:56:59.370 --> 00:56:59.380
you know you have to go and run your web
 

00:56:59.380 --> 00:57:02.310
you know you have to go and run your web

the webview so I usually don't recommend

00:57:07.260 --> 00:57:07.270
the webview so I usually don't recommend
 

00:57:07.270 --> 00:57:09.810
the webview so I usually don't recommend
that people take that approach if you're

00:57:09.810 --> 00:57:09.820
that people take that approach if you're
 

00:57:09.820 --> 00:57:11.280
that people take that approach if you're
really gonna do this I'd recommend

00:57:11.280 --> 00:57:11.290
really gonna do this I'd recommend
 

00:57:11.290 --> 00:57:13.380
really gonna do this I'd recommend
writing everything in JavaScript if

00:57:13.380 --> 00:57:13.390
writing everything in JavaScript if
 

00:57:13.390 --> 00:57:15.720
writing everything in JavaScript if
possible that's going to be a lot

00:57:15.720 --> 00:57:15.730
possible that's going to be a lot
 

00:57:15.730 --> 00:57:18.510
possible that's going to be a lot
friendlier both in terms of CPU and

00:57:18.510 --> 00:57:18.520
friendlier both in terms of CPU and
 

00:57:18.520 --> 00:57:21.810
friendlier both in terms of CPU and
memory usage and you can do pretty much

00:57:21.810 --> 00:57:21.820
memory usage and you can do pretty much
 

00:57:21.820 --> 00:57:24.210
memory usage and you can do pretty much
since you're all interacting locally

00:57:24.210 --> 00:57:24.220
since you're all interacting locally
 

00:57:24.220 --> 00:57:26.220
since you're all interacting locally
anyway there's really no reason why you

00:57:26.220 --> 00:57:26.230
anyway there's really no reason why you
 

00:57:26.230 --> 00:57:28.740
anyway there's really no reason why you
couldn't do everything you're doing in

couldn't do everything you're doing in
 

00:57:28.750 --> 00:57:32.550
couldn't do everything you're doing in
