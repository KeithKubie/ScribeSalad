I mean, Rob, I never tried
to ruin your big moments.

00:00:06.005 --> 00:00:08.708
I didn't tell people
when "The Grinder" got canceled

00:00:08.741 --> 00:00:10.710
or when "Dr. Vegas" got canceled

00:00:10.743 --> 00:00:12.712
or when "Lyon's Den"
got canceled

00:00:12.745 --> 00:00:15.415
or when "Moonbeam City"
got canceled

00:00:15.448 --> 00:00:19.318
or when your DirectTV
commercials got canceled.

00:00:19.351 --> 00:00:21.387
Heck, I was just thinking,
had you been quarterback

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.688
for the Broncos last year,

00:00:22.721 --> 00:00:24.257
the freaking Super Bowl
would have been canceled.
