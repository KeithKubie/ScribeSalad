that involve concatenation and just play
them one after the other and so you

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300
them one after the other and so you
 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.479
them one after the other and so you
didn't bat an eye when three four five

tend to use the two lines right in it to

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:19.159
tend to use the two lines right in it to
 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:20.679
tend to use the two lines right in it to
be complete I probably should have put

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:20.689
be complete I probably should have put
 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:23.800
be complete I probably should have put
in this victory if we go back to the

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810
in this victory if we go back to the
 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.620
in this victory if we go back to the
past to fix previous errors if I was

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630
past to fix previous errors if I was
 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:27.940

being more thorough I would have put

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950
being more thorough I would have put
 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.539
being more thorough I would have put
three concatenate for concatenate five

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:31.549
three concatenate for concatenate five
 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:33.700
three concatenate for concatenate five
concatenate six and down here I should

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710
concatenate six and down here I should
 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.249

have done four concatenate three right

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:36.259
have done four concatenate three right
 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:37.719
have done four concatenate three right
you know to be more thorough

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:37.729
you know to be more thorough
 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:39.880
you know to be more thorough
so that is concatenation is clearly

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890
so that is concatenation is clearly
 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:41.800
so that is concatenation is clearly
allowed if we just for some reason we

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810
allowed if we just for some reason we
 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.779
allowed if we just for some reason we
never bother spelling it out so what I'm

00:01:43.779 --> 00:01:43.789
never bother spelling it out so what I'm
 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:46.480
never bother spelling it out so what I'm
gonna do is here's my almost but not

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490
gonna do is here's my almost but not
 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.399
gonna do is here's my almost but not
good enough attempt so it's gonna be a

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:51.409
good enough attempt so it's gonna be a
 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:53.289
good enough attempt so it's gonna be a
Parker Square this is really cool right

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:53.299
Parker Square this is really cool right
 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:55.679
Parker Square this is really cool right
so you start with twelve so one

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:55.689
so you start with twelve so one
 

00:01:55.689 --> 00:02:00.069
so you start with twelve so one
concatenate two to twelve then times

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:00.079
concatenate two to twelve then times
 

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:05.399
concatenate two to twelve then times
three times four divide that by five

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:05.409
three times four divide that by five
 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:08.770
three times four divide that by five
multiplied it by six multiply it by

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780
multiplied it by six multiply it by
 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.430
multiplied it by six multiply it by
seven add on eight put that whole thing

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440
seven add on eight put that whole thing
 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.210
seven add on eight put that whole thing
in brackets and then multiply that

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220
in brackets and then multiply that
 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.220
in brackets and then multiply that
by nine okay so what does this equal

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230
by nine okay so what does this equal
 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:22.410
by nine okay so what does this equal
let's check that with exactly if it

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420
let's check that with exactly if it
 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.480
let's check that with exactly if it
equals ten nine five eight we are on so

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490
equals ten nine five eight we are on so
 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:25.050
equals ten nine five eight we are on so
here we go

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060
here we go
 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.530
here we go
so one concatenate two that's 12 times 3

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540
so one concatenate two that's 12 times 3
 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:34.200
so one concatenate two that's 12 times 3
times 4 divided by 5 times 6 times 7

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.210
times 4 divided by 5 times 6 times 7
 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:36.060
times 4 divided by 5 times 6 times 7
equals okay so that's the whole thing

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.070
equals okay so that's the whole thing
 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:40.350
equals okay so that's the whole thing
there plus 8 equals 1200 seventeen point

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360
there plus 8 equals 1200 seventeen point
 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.440
there plus 8 equals 1200 seventeen point
six times nine equals ten thousand nine

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450
six times nine equals ten thousand nine
 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.340
six times nine equals ten thousand nine
hundred and fifty eight point four this

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350
hundred and fifty eight point four this
 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.170
hundred and fifty eight point four this
come on that's that's not bad

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180
come on that's that's not bad
 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.960
come on that's that's not bad
ten thousand nine hundred if you say

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970

multiplication or product but they're
 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:46.650
multiplication or product but they're
okay and they're allowed it he never

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660
okay and they're allowed it he never
 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.440
okay and they're allowed it he never
explicitly says concatenation all he

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450
explicitly says concatenation all he
 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:51.180
explicitly says concatenation all he
does is in here he goes you can add a

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190
does is in here he goes you can add a
 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:53.490
does is in here he goes you can add a
and b multiply a and b powers of a and b

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500
and b multiply a and b powers of a and b
 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.160
and b multiply a and b powers of a and b
oh and of course i am be forming a

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.170
oh and of course i am be forming a
 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:00.570
oh and of course i am be forming a
number so all the ones in here a lot of

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:00.580
number so all the ones in here a lot of
 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:02.520
number so all the ones in here a lot of
them do use concatenation right from the

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530
them do use concatenation right from the
 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.050
them do use concatenation right from the
beginning it's never assumed you can't

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060
beginning it's never assumed you can't
 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:07.020
beginning it's never assumed you can't
do that but it's never used as a step

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030
do that but it's never used as a step
 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.630
do that but it's never used as a step
during the calculation it's only used in

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:09.640
during the calculation it's only used in
 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.729
during the calculation it's only used in
a set up of the numbers that you then

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:11.739
a set up of the numbers that you then
 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:14.070
a set up of the numbers that you then
apply the other operations to and I was

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:14.080
apply the other operations to and I was
 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:16.170
apply the other operations to and I was
like that's a bit arbitrary it should be

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180
like that's a bit arbitrary it should be
 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:17.640
like that's a bit arbitrary it should be
a fully-fledged function if you go

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650
a fully-fledged function if you go
 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:19.580
a fully-fledged function if you go
include it you've got to include it and

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590
include it you've got to include it and
 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:25.080
include it you've got to include it and
so I found one times two concatenated

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090
so I found one times two concatenated
 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:29.040
so I found one times two concatenated
with three plus in brackets

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.050
with three plus in brackets
 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:34.920
with three plus in brackets
four times five times six and then that

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930
four times five times six and then that
 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:36.510
four times five times six and then that
so four times five just you know we're

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:36.520
so four times five just you know we're
 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.070
so four times five just you know we're
going with this that's going to be 20

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080
going with this that's going to be 20
 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.629
going with this that's going to be 20
times six is 120

00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:39.639
times six is 120
 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:42.689
times six is 120
but then 120 is concatenated with seven

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:42.699
but then 120 is concatenated with seven
 

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:44.670
but then 120 is concatenated with seven
so now you do the calculation first and

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:44.680
so now you do the calculation first and
 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.649
so now you do the calculation first and
then you concatenate with another digit

00:04:46.649 --> 00:04:46.659
then you concatenate with another digit
 

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:49.409
then you concatenate with another digit
then you add on an eight and that whole

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:49.419
then you add on an eight and that whole
 

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:52.980
then you add on an eight and that whole
thing you multiply by nine

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:52.990
thing you multiply by nine
 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:55.320
thing you multiply by nine
shall we check it let's just do this

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:55.330
shall we check it let's just do this
 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.540
shall we check it let's just do this
simplify it so they're equals okay one

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:57.550
simplify it so they're equals okay one
 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:59.790
simplify it so they're equals okay one
times twenty three that's just twenty

00:04:59.790 --> 00:04:59.800
times twenty three that's just twenty
 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:00.960
times twenty three that's just twenty
three I think we're all quite happy with

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:00.970
three I think we're all quite happy with
 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:03.869
three I think we're all quite happy with
that plus in brackets that's going to be

00:05:03.869 --> 00:05:03.879
that plus in brackets that's going to be
 

00:05:03.879 --> 00:05:07.939
that plus in brackets that's going to be
four times five is 20 times 6 is 120

00:05:07.939 --> 00:05:07.949
four times five is 20 times 6 is 120
 

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:11.040
four times five is 20 times 6 is 120
concatenate with seven and then we're

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:11.050
concatenate with seven and then we're
 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:13.080
concatenate with seven and then we're
gonna add on eight and then we're going

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:13.090
gonna add on eight and then we're going
 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:14.969
gonna add on eight and then we're going
to multiply that by nine so now we've

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:14.979
to multiply that by nine so now we've
 

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:19.950
to multiply that by nine so now we've
got 23 plus 1 2 if I want to do this all

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:19.960
got 23 plus 1 2 if I want to do this all
 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:22.050
got 23 plus 1 2 if I want to do this all
at once actually you know I'll do that

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:22.060
at once actually you know I'll do that
 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:23.850
at once actually you know I'll do that
step there there's a concatenation plus

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:23.860
step there there's a concatenation plus
 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:26.879
step there there's a concatenation plus
8 and then that there's multiplies by 9

00:05:26.879 --> 00:05:26.889
8 and then that there's multiplies by 9
 

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:28.800
8 and then that there's multiplies by 9
ok so let's let's so we took that into

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:28.810
ok so let's let's so we took that into
 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:30.689
ok so let's let's so we took that into
the calculator now that feels like it's

00:05:30.689 --> 00:05:30.699
the calculator now that feels like it's
 

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:32.369
the calculator now that feels like it's
obvious enough that we can we can drive

00:05:32.369 --> 00:05:32.379
obvious enough that we can we can drive
 

00:05:32.379 --> 00:05:35.309
obvious enough that we can we can drive
this home one two zero seven plus eight

00:05:35.309 --> 00:05:35.319
this home one two zero seven plus eight
 

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:39.180
this home one two zero seven plus eight
equals unsurprisingly 1215 times nine

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:39.190
equals unsurprisingly 1215 times nine
 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:42.629
equals unsurprisingly 1215 times nine
equals that plus the 23 at the top

00:05:42.629 --> 00:05:42.639
equals that plus the 23 at the top
 

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:50.909
equals that plus the 23 at the top
equals 10,000 958 there it is so we have

00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:50.919
equals 10,000 958 there it is so we have
 

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:53.550
equals 10,000 958 there it is so we have
filled the gap because the gap was only

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:53.560
filled the gap because the gap was only
 

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:55.370
filled the gap because the gap was only
there because people weren't taking

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:55.380
there because people weren't taking
 

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:58.379
there because people weren't taking
concatenations seriously and I have I've

00:05:58.379 --> 00:05:58.389
concatenations seriously and I have I've
 

00:05:58.389 --> 00:06:00.510
concatenations seriously and I have I've
taken it seriously I've filled the gap

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:00.520
taken it seriously I've filled the gap
 

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:02.730
taken it seriously I've filled the gap
and I'm gonna send it in I'm gonna I'm

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:02.740
and I'm gonna send it in I'm gonna I'm
 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:04.469
and I'm gonna send it in I'm gonna I'm
gonna I'll be like I think I fill the

00:06:04.469 --> 00:06:04.479
gonna I'll be like I think I fill the
 

00:06:04.479 --> 00:06:09.089
gonna I'll be like I think I fill the
gap it is it is now available really

00:06:09.089 --> 00:06:09.099
gap it is it is now available really
 

00:06:09.099 --> 00:06:12.119
gap it is it is now available really
that's the only reason I found this by

00:06:12.119 --> 00:06:12.129
that's the only reason I found this by
 

00:06:12.129 --> 00:06:14.790
that's the only reason I found this by
the way is because I wasn't afraid to

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:14.800
the way is because I wasn't afraid to
 

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.890
the way is because I wasn't afraid to
try something where the odds are I was

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:16.900
try something where the odds are I was
 

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:19.469
try something where the odds are I was
gonna fail miserably and I think that is

00:06:19.469 --> 00:06:19.479
gonna fail miserably and I think that is
 

00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:21.269
gonna fail miserably and I think that is
the moral of the Parker square right you

00:06:21.269 --> 00:06:21.279
the moral of the Parker square right you
 

00:06:21.279 --> 00:06:23.159
the moral of the Parker square right you
give it a go even though it's probably

00:06:23.159 --> 00:06:23.169
give it a go even though it's probably
 

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:25.469
give it a go even though it's probably
not gonna work and you embrace it you

00:06:25.469 --> 00:06:25.479
not gonna work and you embrace it you
 

00:06:25.479 --> 00:06:28.290
not gonna work and you embrace it you
own it when it doesn't work every now

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:28.300
own it when it doesn't work every now
 

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:33.780
own it when it doesn't work every now
and then it does work out for you

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:33.790
 
 

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:37.990
 
times that bass had we worked out the

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:38.000
times that bass had we worked out the
 

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.670
times that bass had we worked out the
length or something well you use a log

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:39.680
length or something well you use a log
 

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:43.240
length or something well you use a log
right so it's log base whatever the

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:43.250
right so it's log base whatever the
 

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:48.190
right so it's log base whatever the
basis of your next digit
