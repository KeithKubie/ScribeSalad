Do bras really cause breast cancer, or is
that just a myth perpetuated by hippies and

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:12.220
perverts?

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:16.439
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews - and it seems
like cancer is one of those weird areas of

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:19.039
medicine that people love to develop theories
about.

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:22.829
“Don’t eat that food - it contains cancer
chemicals” “Don’t use products that

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:24.710
contain parabens, they’ll give you cancer!”

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:25.900
But what about bras?

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.399
I mean aside from sucking, can they really
cause cancer?

00:00:29.399 --> 00:00:34.010
Not a lot of people gave much thought to that
question, until 2005 - when a book was published

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:39.039
by authors who claimed to have evidence of
a link between bras and breast cancer.

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:43.969
The idea was that bras impede on the circulation
and drainage of your lymphatic system, which

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:48.379
interferes with your body’s waste removal
process, and boosts your risk for breast cancer.

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:52.640
A lot of media outlets immediately grabbed
onto that story, and ran with it - supporting

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.920
it with the fact that breast cancer is more
common in developed countries - which they

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.170
claim, could’ve been related to the fact
that women in those areas are more likely

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:01.170
to wear bras.

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.790
It makes sense to a point, but according to
a new study - it’s also blatantly false.

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.040
For their study, researchers evaluated over
1,000 women who had been diagnosed with breast

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:17.110
cancer between 2000 and 2004, comparing them
to 469 women who didn’t have breast cancer.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.590
They also gathered a bunch of data on the
types of bras those women wore - including

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.630
cup size and the presence of an underwire
- as well as when they began wearing them,

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.850
and how many hours a day they wore them.

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.420
Any confounding factors, like family history
of breast cancer, height, weight, race, income,

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.590
etc - were all accounted for.

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.920
According to researchers, their results definitively
found no evidence that wearing a bra increases

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.410
a woman’s risk for breast cancer.

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:44.990
It seems no matter how often you wear a bra,
or what kind of bra you wear - the risk is

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:46.190
the same either way.

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.700
So burn your bra, don’t burn your bra - whatever
you choose!

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.760
Because either way, it does not matter.

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.420
And hey - if you’re itching to learn more
about the wonderful world of bras, let me

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:00.010
point you to another show I host called Anyhoo,
where we recently did an episode with 8 busty

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:02.850
facts about bras.

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:08.149
For instance - did you know that the largest
bra size ever recorded was a 102 ZZZZ?

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:12.890
I’ll bet you didn’t - and it’s that
kind of hard-hitting investigative reporting

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:24.260
that we love here at Discovery.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:30.510
If you wanna check out more of Anyhoo, just
head over to youtube.com/revision3 - and in

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.950
the meantime, if you guys have any questions,
comments, rants about bras maybe - just leave

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.100
em in the comments below.

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:38.200
Otherwise, thanks for watching!
