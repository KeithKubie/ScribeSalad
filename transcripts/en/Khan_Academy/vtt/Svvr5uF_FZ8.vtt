00:00:00.143 --> 00:00:03.719
What I want to do in this video
is start exploring entropy.

00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:06.923
When you first get exposed
to the idea entropy

00:00:06.923 --> 00:00:08.386
it seems a little bit mysterious.

00:00:08.386 --> 00:00:11.242
But as we do more videos we'll
hopefully build a very strong

00:00:11.242 --> 00:00:12.565
intuition of what it is.

00:00:12.565 --> 00:00:15.073
So one of the more typical definitions,

00:00:15.073 --> 00:00:17.023
or a lot of the definitions
you'll see of entropy,

00:00:17.023 --> 00:00:20.367
they'll involve the word disorder.

00:00:20.367 --> 00:00:23.664
So it might be considered
the disorder of a system.

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.787
Now with just that
definition in your head,

00:00:33.787 --> 00:00:36.156
I want you to pause this video
and I want you to compare

00:00:36.156 --> 00:00:38.222
this system to this system.

00:00:38.222 --> 00:00:39.964
I want you to compare
this room to this room,

00:00:39.964 --> 00:00:43.028
and ask yourself, which
of these has more entropy.

00:00:43.028 --> 00:00:47.347
And then I want you to compare
the moon here to the sun,

00:00:47.347 --> 00:00:49.158
and these clearly aren't
at scale, the sun would

00:00:49.158 --> 00:00:51.991
be way more massive or way larger

00:00:51.991 --> 00:00:53.315
if I was drawing it to scale.

00:00:53.315 --> 00:00:55.961
But which of these
systems has more entropy?

00:00:55.961 --> 00:00:59.142
Alright, so I'm assuming
you've had a go at it.

00:00:59.142 --> 00:01:01.998
So when you look at
these rooms you might say

00:01:01.998 --> 00:01:05.087
okay this room over
here, this looks ordered,

00:01:05.087 --> 00:01:07.246
It's a clean room.

00:01:07.246 --> 00:01:10.148
And this over here looks
disordered, it's a messy room.

00:01:12.876 --> 00:01:15.345
So if all you had is this
definition, you'd say okay

00:01:15.345 --> 00:01:16.645
maybe this one is more disordered,

00:01:16.645 --> 00:01:18.154
maybe this one has more entropy.

00:01:18.154 --> 00:01:20.615
And you wouldn't be
alone in thinking that.

00:01:20.615 --> 00:01:22.241
In fact, even in a lot
of textbooks they'll use

00:01:22.241 --> 00:01:25.073
this analogy of a clean
room verses a messy room.

00:01:25.073 --> 00:01:27.047
And the messy room
somehow being indicative

00:01:27.047 --> 00:01:28.626
of having more entropy.

00:01:28.626 --> 00:01:30.646
But this isn't exactly the case.

00:01:30.646 --> 00:01:33.130
This form of disorder
is not the same thing

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:34.872
as this form of disorder.

00:01:34.872 --> 00:01:37.705
So let me make this very, very clear.

00:01:37.705 --> 00:01:39.434
So something being messy,

00:01:43.364 --> 00:01:44.902
does not equal entropy.

00:01:48.882 --> 00:01:51.538
To think about what disorder
means in the entropy sense

00:01:51.538 --> 00:01:54.115
we're going to have to
flex our visualization

00:01:54.115 --> 00:01:55.531
of muscles a little bit more,

00:01:55.531 --> 00:01:56.948
but hopefully it'll all sink in.

00:01:56.948 --> 00:02:00.640
Entropy, this kind of a
disorder is more of the number

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.869
of states that a system can take on.

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:05.353
What do I mean by states of a system?

00:02:06.543 --> 00:02:09.360
Well if I have a container like this,

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:14.091
and if I have four molecules

00:02:14.091 --> 00:02:15.554
that are bouncing around.

00:02:15.554 --> 00:02:20.554
So I have this magenta molecule,
I have this blue molecule,

00:02:23.951 --> 00:02:28.918
I have this yellow
molecule right over here,

00:02:31.678 --> 00:02:33.098
and then I have a green molecule.

00:02:33.098 --> 00:02:36.674
Well this would be a particular state,

00:02:36.674 --> 00:02:38.043
a particular configuration.

00:02:38.043 --> 00:02:40.574
But that system these
molecules are bouncing around

00:02:40.574 --> 00:02:42.316
could take on other configurations.

00:02:42.316 --> 00:02:43.779
Or it could take on other states.

00:02:43.779 --> 00:02:47.169
Or maybe the yellow molecule is over here,

00:02:47.169 --> 00:02:48.771
they bounce around enough
for the yellow molecule

00:02:48.771 --> 00:02:51.766
to get there, the blue
molecule to get over here,

00:02:51.766 --> 00:02:56.365
maybe the pink molecule is now over here,

00:02:56.365 --> 00:03:00.845
and the green molecule is now over here.

00:03:01.535 --> 00:03:03.935
And so a system can take on
a bunch of different states.

00:03:03.935 --> 00:03:05.607
I've just drawn two
states for this system.

00:03:05.607 --> 00:03:07.859
But there could be many, many
more states for this system.

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:10.901
So each of these are a
particular state for the system.

00:03:10.901 --> 00:03:15.034
So imagine this system
where I have this box with

00:03:15.034 --> 00:03:16.659
the four molecules in it,

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:18.852
and let's compare it to another system

00:03:21.802 --> 00:03:23.273
where I have a larger box.

00:03:25.693 --> 00:03:27.400
And let's say it has even
more molecules in it.

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.946
Let's say that it has
two yellow molecules,

00:03:33.596 --> 00:03:36.790
let's say that is has a blue molecule,

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.867
let's say that it has a green molecule,

00:03:39.867 --> 00:03:44.036
let's say that it has a
magenta molecule, this is fun.

00:03:44.036 --> 00:03:47.937
Let's say it has a mauve
molecule right over here.

00:03:47.937 --> 00:03:50.607
So this system that is
larger, there's more places

00:03:50.607 --> 00:03:52.186
for the molecules to
be and there's actually

00:03:52.186 --> 00:03:53.301
more molecules in it.

00:03:53.301 --> 00:03:55.576
This can actually take
on more configurations

00:03:55.576 --> 00:03:56.598
or more states.

00:03:58.398 --> 00:03:59.661
I've just drawn one of
them but there's many more.

00:03:59.661 --> 00:04:01.937
If you imagine these
molecules all bouncing around

00:04:01.937 --> 00:04:05.118
in different ways there's
many, many different states

00:04:05.118 --> 00:04:06.186
that it could take on.

00:04:06.186 --> 00:04:07.695
So the system without even knowing

00:04:07.695 --> 00:04:09.018
what the actual molecules are doing

00:04:09.018 --> 00:04:11.503
at that given moment in
time, we would say that

00:04:11.503 --> 00:04:14.127
there's more possible states

00:04:18.687 --> 00:04:21.041
relative to this one, this
has fewer possible states.

00:04:28.361 --> 00:04:31.230
And because this system over
here has more possible states,

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:33.969
more configurations, it would take more

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:37.127
to tell you exactly where everything is.

00:04:37.127 --> 00:04:39.217
We would say that this has more entropy.

00:04:43.797 --> 00:04:46.128
So when we talk about disorder,
we're really talking about

00:04:46.128 --> 00:04:48.659
the number of states something could have.

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:51.514
And it makes sense that
this thing you could imagine

00:04:51.514 --> 00:04:53.627
there's a lot more stuff moving around

00:04:53.627 --> 00:04:55.276
and a lot more different
directions and they have

00:04:55.276 --> 00:04:56.530
a lot more space to move around.

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:58.364
So it makes sense that
the system as a whole

00:04:58.364 --> 00:04:59.479
has more entropy.

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:01.777
So when we talk about entropy
we're not talking about

00:05:01.777 --> 00:05:03.960
any one of the particular states,

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.073
any one of the particular configurations,

00:05:06.073 --> 00:05:07.977
we're talking about the system as a whole

00:05:07.977 --> 00:05:11.065
without really knowing exactly
where the molecules are.

00:05:11.065 --> 00:05:13.364
In this example with the rooms,

00:05:13.364 --> 00:05:15.221
we're just talking
about particular states.

00:05:15.221 --> 00:05:19.261
Messy is a particular state,
clean is a particular state.

00:05:19.261 --> 00:05:21.351
But we're not talking about
the number of configurations

00:05:21.351 --> 00:05:23.185
that a room could actually have.

00:05:23.185 --> 00:05:25.855
In fact if this room is
larger, this room actually

00:05:25.855 --> 00:05:30.308
could have more configurations.

00:05:30.308 --> 00:05:31.823
And if we're talking
about the molecular level

00:05:31.823 --> 00:05:34.354
if this room was warm
and this room were cold,

00:05:34.354 --> 00:05:36.977
and actually if this room is
just larger, it's going to have

00:05:36.977 --> 00:05:38.022
more molecules in it.

00:05:38.022 --> 00:05:39.415
And those molecules are going to be

00:05:39.415 --> 00:05:41.505
in way more configurations
that they could be arranged

00:05:41.505 --> 00:05:43.847
so there could be an argument that this

00:05:43.867 --> 00:05:45.419
actually has a higher entropy.

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:47.718
And so using that same
reasoning, let's go back

00:05:47.718 --> 00:05:50.319
to that comparison of
the moon and the sun.

00:05:50.319 --> 00:05:52.176
Which of these would have more entropy?

00:05:52.176 --> 00:05:54.057
Well let's think about it.

00:05:54.057 --> 00:05:58.794
The sun is larger, it has
way, way more molecules

00:05:58.794 --> 00:06:01.626
and those molecules are
moving around way faster

00:06:01.626 --> 00:06:03.948
and they're hotter and they're
moving past each other.

00:06:03.948 --> 00:06:07.222
While the moon is small, it's
cold, it has fewer molecules.

00:06:09.972 --> 00:06:10.979
It's for the most part rigid,

00:06:10.979 --> 00:06:12.953
it doesn't have a very high
temperature so these things

00:06:12.953 --> 00:06:14.160
aren't moving around a lot.

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.387
It has way fewer states,
way fewer configurations

00:06:17.387 --> 00:06:18.757
than the sun does.

00:06:18.757 --> 00:06:21.265
So the sun's entropy, if
you view it as a system.

00:06:21.265 --> 00:06:25.932
If you view the sun as a system,
it's entropy is way higher

00:06:25.932 --> 00:06:27.460
than the moon.

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:35.670
It's entropy is much larger
than the entropy of the moon.

00:06:36.258 --> 00:06:38.069
Think about it, how much
information you would need.

00:06:38.069 --> 00:06:40.159
You would need a lot of
information if someone wanted

00:06:40.159 --> 00:06:42.272
to tell you where every molecule

00:06:42.272 --> 00:06:44.524
or every atom on the moon is.

00:06:44.524 --> 00:06:46.823
But you would need even more
to know where every atom

00:06:46.823 --> 00:06:49.144
or molecule for in a given
moment on the sun is.

00:06:49.144 --> 00:06:50.677
If you're just looking at
the sun, wow all these things

00:06:50.677 --> 00:06:53.277
are moving around and
it's this huge volume.

00:06:53.277 --> 00:06:55.994
And they're very energetic
and all of these molecules.

00:06:55.994 --> 00:06:58.223
So hopefully this starts
to give you a sense

00:06:58.223 --> 00:06:59.338
of what entropy is.

00:06:59.338 --> 00:07:00.545
And you might say okay this is all

00:07:00.545 --> 00:07:02.449
fun intellectual discussion,
what's the big deal?

00:07:02.449 --> 00:07:05.212
But the big deal is that to some degree

00:07:05.212 --> 00:07:08.579
you can describe the
universe in terms of entropy.

00:07:08.579 --> 00:07:12.480
As we learn in the second
law of thermodynamics,

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:15.893
the entropy in the universe
is constantly increasing.

00:07:15.893 --> 00:07:18.354
We are constantly moving to a universe

00:07:18.354 --> 00:07:20.304
with more possible states,

00:07:20.304 --> 00:07:24.001
which has all sorts of
interesting implications.
