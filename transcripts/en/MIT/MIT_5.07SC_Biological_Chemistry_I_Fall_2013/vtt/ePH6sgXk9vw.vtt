JOHN ESSIGMANN: One of the
physiological scenarios

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:11.740
that we teach, and
is probably very

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.160
common in biochemistry courses,
has to do with diabetes.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:20.530
I'm diabetic, and my great
grandfather was diabetic.

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:24.280
His daughter, my
grandmother was diabetic.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:28.510
Five of her six sons were
diabetic, one of whom

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:29.830
was my father.

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:34.300
So you see a very
genetic disease here.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:34.940
OK?

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:40.420
That's, in my case, type 2
diabetic, so adult onset.

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:48.890
So my cells are
insulin-resistant.

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:56.280
So if I eat a meal that has
carbohydrate or fat in it,

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.450
my pancreas is
probably responding.

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:03.110
My beta cells in my
pancreas are probably OK,

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:04.920
but the insulin
just isn't able--

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.970
but producing insulin--
but the insulin

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.850
just isn't able to
signal my cells to be

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.320
able to take up the glucose.

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:19.210
As a consequence, I'm
somewhat in a technical state

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.340
of starvation.

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.780
My glycogen reserves are
therefore smaller than yours,

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.000
and I can tell this in times.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.180
For example, when I
first became diabetic,

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.900
I loved mountain climbing
and hiking and so on,

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:40.360
and I noticed that
I would go out.

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.590
And I'd be totally exhausted
for the first 10 minutes or so,

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.870
and that's because I have
very small glycogen reserves.

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:51.310
What I had to do is
this metabolic switch

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.930
over to booting up oxidative
metabolism of fats.

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.230
That all had to be
turned on, and it's hard.

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:01.090
It's a hard transition,
but once it got going,

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.680
as long as I stay
aerobic, in other words,

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:09.190
I don't go so fast that I go
anaerobic, I can climb forever.

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.330
Because if I stay aerobic, I've
got plenty of fat reserves.

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.700
In fact, it's probably a good
thing that I'm burning them.

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.374
So I'm just a little
bit different.

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:24.870
I like to teach
this stuff in 5.07,

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.470
in part because well there's
probably not that many kids

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.300
in the class, of 100, 130, or
so, students would be diabetic,

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.350
but it's about 6% to 8% of the
population in the United States

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:38.050
right now.

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.500
So everybody knows
someone who is diabetic,

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.570
or maybe your parents are,
and what are the risk factors?

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:45.530
So we teach that.
