00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:01.850
We're on problem nine.

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:03.780
Use the problem below
to answer the

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:05.570
question that follows.

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:09.730
Given that 100 milliliters is
equal to approximately 0.4

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:13.190
cups, 205 milliliters
is equal to

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:15.760
approximately how many cups?

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:17.280
So we could set up a
little ratio here.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:26.670
We could say 100 milliliters
is to 0.4 cups as 200

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.940
milliliters-- I'll write
the cups here--

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:33.250
is to how many cups?

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:34.430
Just like that.

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.920
And so we just have
to solve for x.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.480
To solve for x, we could
essentially cross multiply,

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.700
which essentially you're just
multiplying both sides of the

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.910
equation by both denominators.

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.170
So we get 100x.

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:52.110
100 times x is equal
to 200 times 0.4.

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.960
It's not 200, it's 205 to be
exact, 205 times 0.4-- is

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.410
equal to 205 times 0.4.

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:04.440
And then we want to divide
both sides by 100.

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:13.050
So x is equal to 205/100
times 0.4.

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:15.430
Let me write it a little
bit different,

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.950
0.4, just like that.

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.990
We could divide either by 100,
but let's see if any of the

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.730
choices look like what we have
there, something times 0.4.

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:25.390
Well this one has subtraction
in it, so

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:26.300
that's not our answer.

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:27.520
This one, also has

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.360
subtraction, is not our answer.

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:37.350
105% of 0.4-- that's the same
thing as 1.05 times 0.4.

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:44.270
205% times 0.4-- that's the same
thing is 2.05 times 0.4,

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.440
which is exactly what
we have here.

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.850
And just to verify, 205 divided
by 100-- I'll do it

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.200
right here-- 100
goes into 205.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.120
100 goes into 200 2 times.

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.290
2 times 100 is 200.

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:01.530
Let me put a little decimal
right there.

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.780
You do the subtraction,
you get 5.

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.410
Bring down a 0.

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:08.860
100 goes into 50 0 times.

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.090
0 times 100 is 0.

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:12.260
Do the subtraction.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:13.670
Bring down another 0.

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.500
100 goes into 500 5 times.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:17.690
5 times 100 is 500.

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.845
It all evens out to 0.

00:02:19.845 --> 00:02:21.710
So you get 2.05.

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:27.200
So this thing is the same thing
as 2.05 times 0.4, which

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.170
is the same thing
as 205% of 0.4.

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.950
Choice D.

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.200
Next problem.

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.166
All right, we are
on problem 10.

00:02:41.166 --> 00:02:43.280
I'll switch colors.

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.930
Use the number line below
to answer the

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:46.885
question that follows.

00:02:46.885 --> 00:02:48.550
OK, we have the number line.

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:50.730
What number is represented
by point P on

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.530
the number line above?

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.370
OK, so they give us two
endpoints, 0.003 and 0.004.

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.270
And how many buckets do
we have between them?

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.490
We're going one increment.

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:04.870
Oh sorry, I'm on the
wrong layer.

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.110
We go one increment, two
increments, three increments,

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:12.570
four increments, five
increments, six increments,

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:16.390
seven increments, eight
increments.

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:21.890
So over eight increments, we
go a distance of how far?

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:28.470
Well, the distance we go is
0.004 minus 0.003, which is

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.880
just 0.001.

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.200
So this whole distance,
this whole distance

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:41.340
right there, is 0.001.

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.170
And so each of these
are 1/8 of 0.001.

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.263
Right?

00:03:45.263 --> 00:03:46.560
Let me do that in
another color.

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.210
All right, we have one,
two, three, four,

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:50.600
five, six, seven, eight.

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.770
Don't want to make
it any dirtier.

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:56.640
Each of those are
1/8 of 0.001.

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:03.310
Or you could say it's 8 divided
by or 0.001 divided by

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.940
8 is how much each of these
increments are.

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.040
And what we're at, the point
in question, is exactly two

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.360
increments past 0.003.

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.330
So let's figure out how
far each increment is.

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:19.160
It's 0.001, which is its entire
distance, divided by 8.

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.920
And the best way we can do this,
we'll just put a decimal

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:23.420
right there.

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:25.910
8 goes into 0, 0 times.

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:30.930
8 goes into-- 0 times 8
is 0, bring down a 0.

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.180
8 goes into 0 0 times.

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.440
Bring down a 0, 0 there.

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.320
Bring down a 1.

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.100
8 goes into 1 0 times.

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.840
0 times 8 is 0.

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:44.970
Bring down the 1.

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:47.100
You could bring down another
0, and now it gets

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.640
interesting.

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:50.020
8 goes into 10 1 time.

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:51.980
1 times 8 is 8.

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:53.620
10 minus 8 is 2.

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:54.600
Bring down a 0.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.980
8 goes into 20 2 times.

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:00.040
2 times 8 is 16.

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:01.690
20 minus 16 is 4.

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:02.850
Bring another 0.

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:06.140
8 goes into 40 5 times.

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:08.820
So it's 0.000125.

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:13.380
And you might already know that
1/8 is equal to 0.125.

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.630
That's something you might
just know from heart.

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:20.050
And so, if you have this divided
by-- this isn't--

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:23.370
we're not dealing with 1/8,
we're dealing with 0.0018, so

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:27.270
with this divided by 1,000,
you're going to have three 0's

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:30.790
and then your 125.

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:32.360
So that's how much each
increment is.

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:36.160
And we're going two of these
increments, just like that.

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:40.160
So if you multiply this times
2, what do you get?

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:47.150
You say 2 times 125 is 250, but
we have one, two, three,

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:50.420
four, five, six numbers behind
the decimal point.

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:53.495
So one, two, three,
four, five, six.

00:05:53.495 --> 00:05:55.410
We have to have six numbers
behind the decimal point in

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:56.370
our answer.

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:02.950
So that's how much we
move above 0.003.

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:08.600
So essentially, this is going to
be 0.000125, another 00125,

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:11.390
and it's all above 0.003.

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:17.460
So our answer is going to be
0.003 plus this-- plus 0.003,

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:23.080
which gets us to 0.00325.

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:26.010
So that is 0.00325.

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:28.710
And I just realized, there is
an actual much, much easier

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:29.350
way to think about it.

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:32.960
Instead of dividing by 8 and all
of that, I could have just

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:33.890
said, you know what?

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:35.700
There are eight increments
here.

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:38.930
I've made this problem messy,
but there are eight increments

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:43.540
here-- one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:44.720
We've gone two of them.

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:46.650
So we've gone 1/4
of the distance

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:49.980
between 0.003 and 0.004.

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:52.360
And that would have been the
easiest way to do the problem.

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:55.680
1/4 of the distance is
just another 0.25.

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:58.190
That would've been way easier to
do the problem, especially

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:01.080
if you didn't want to
waste a lot of time.

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:02.500
Problem 11.

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:06.170
A book distributor is trying
to divide an order of

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:08.680
textbooks into equally-sized
groups

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:10.230
for shipping in cartons.

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:13.080
The textbooks can be divided
into groups of 12, groups of

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:17.580
15, or groups of 18, with
no books left over.

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:20.550
So that means that the number of
books we have is divisible

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:22.820
by these three numbers.

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:27.710
Which of the following
inequalities is satisfied if N

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:32.420
is the smallest possible total
number of textbooks?

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:36.110
So essentially, we know that N
is divisible by these three

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:38.680
numbers, and we want to find
the least possible N that's

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:40.820
divisible by these
three numbers.

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:44.240
Or essentially, the least common
multiple of-- so we

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:46.230
want to-- let me write
this down.

00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:53.570
N is equal to the least common
multiple of 12, 15, and 18.

00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:56.340
And the easiest way for, at
least for me to think about

00:07:56.340 --> 00:08:00.100
this type of a least common
multiple problem, is to just

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:03.040
take the factors of each
of these numbers.

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:05.690
Let's take the prime
factorization of these guys,

00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:06.230
right here.

00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:10.510
So 12, if we want to take the
prime factorization of 12,

00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:11.590
it's-- let's see.

00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:13.720
We could do a little tree here,
but it's pretty easy.

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:19.140
It's 4 times 3, 4 is the same
thing is 2 times 2 times 3.

00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:20.030
That's 12.

00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:22.470
So if we just have the least
common multiple of just 12, we

00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:24.650
would say, well they have
to have a 2 in it

00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:27.180
times a 2 times a 3.

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:28.590
So we have other numbers here.

00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:29.800
We have the 15.

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:31.050
Another color.

00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:35.580
15 is equal to what?

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:40.270
It's prime factorization
is 3 times 5.

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:43.730
So our answer right now, we
already have a 3 as a prime,

00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:47.870
so to make this divisible by
15, we just have to include

00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:49.930
the 5 only.

00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:51.540
So 3 times 5.

00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:53.800
So this number, right now,
is now divisible

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:55.650
by both 12 and 15.

00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:56.610
How do I know?

00:08:56.610 --> 00:09:00.000
Because all of 12's constituent
factors, or prime

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.770
factors, are in this number.

00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:04.880
And all of 15's constituent
numbers are in this number.

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:06.280
So this, right now, is
the least common

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:08.290
multiple of 12 and 15.

00:09:08.290 --> 00:09:11.580
And then we can throw
18 into the mix.

00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:15.930
So 18, that's the same thing
as 2 times 9, or 2

00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:18.460
times 3 times 3.

00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:20.750
And our answer, here, we already
have a 2 times 3, so

00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:22.770
we already have these two
constituents, but we

00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:23.650
need another 3.

00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:26.510
So let's multiply
by another 3.

00:09:26.510 --> 00:09:29.710
Now this is going to be the
least common multiple of 12,

00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:33.070
15, and 18, because it has all
of the constituents of all of

00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:33.630
these guys.

00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:37.380
You have one 2, and two 3's.

00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:39.270
A 3 and a 5.

00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:41.750
Two 2's and a 3.

00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:44.685
You have all the prime factors
of all of these guys, and now

00:09:44.685 --> 00:09:46.360
you can just multiply.

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:53.040
4 times 4-- sorry-- 2 times
2 is 4 times 3.

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:55.890
Let me do it-- times
3 times 5 times 3.

00:09:55.890 --> 00:09:59.730
4 times 3 is 12 times
5 times 3.

00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:05.960
12 times 5 is 60 times 3,
which is equal to 180.

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:10.440
So that is the smallest total
number of books, the least

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:12.070
common multiple of these.

00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:14.210
And that means that's
choice B.

00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:19.500
180 is between 150 and 200.
