00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:05.400
Write 15:25 as a fraction
in simplest form.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.350
So 15 to 25 is just a ratio,
and we can write it.

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:14.280
So they've given us 15 to 25.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:20.600
And you can write this ratio as
a fraction, as 15 over 25.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.270
And if we want to put this in
simplest form, we just have to

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:26.390
think about what is the largest
number that divides

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.830
into both 15 and 25?

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.810
Or what is their greatest
common factor?

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.470
When you just eyeball it, you
say, well, 5 goes into both of

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:36.120
them, and I'm pretty sure that's
the largest number that

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.940
divides into both, so let's
divide both by 5.

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.430
If there is a larger number,
then we might be able to see

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.240
it once we've simplified
it a little bit more.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.820
So let's divide the numerator
and the denominator by 5 and

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.260
see what we get.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.560
So now we get 15 divided
by 5 is equal to 3.

00:00:52.560 --> 00:01:00.470
And 25 divided by 5 is equal
to 5, and now we have 3/5.

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:04.910
3 and 5 don't share any common
factors greater than 1, so it

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:06.750
is in simplest form.

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.580
So we've done what they asked.

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.830
We've written it as a fraction
in simplest form.

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.090
We could also write this, if
we want to write it in this

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.625
type of notation, as 3:5.
