00:00:00.416 --> 00:00:02.230
- [Voiceover] In the figure above,

00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:05.337
CDE is an equilateral triangle.

00:00:05.337 --> 00:00:07.106
So that means this side
is equal to that side

00:00:07.106 --> 00:00:08.465
is equal to that side.

00:00:08.465 --> 00:00:12.484
AB and ABCE is a square with an area of 1.

00:00:12.617 --> 00:00:14.413
So this is a square with an area of 1.

00:00:14.737 --> 00:00:18.684
What is the perimeter of polygon ABCDE?

00:00:20.861 --> 00:00:23.796
Well, since we know this
is a square with area 1,

00:00:23.796 --> 00:00:25.429
we know that this

00:00:26.736 --> 00:00:29.032
is equivalent to that right over there,

00:00:29.032 --> 00:00:31.665
and the product of this
number is going to be 1.

00:00:31.665 --> 00:00:32.918
So it has to be 1.

00:00:33.131 --> 00:00:34.558
This times this is 1.

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.332
They're the same thing, so
that is 1, and that is 1.

00:00:37.636 --> 00:00:40.305
Well, it's a square, so that
side is also going to be 1.

00:00:40.652 --> 00:00:42.360
And this side is also going to be 1.

00:00:42.916 --> 00:00:45.384
Now, we were just told that
this is an equilateral triangle.

00:00:45.548 --> 00:00:47.628
The length of CD is the
same as DE is the same

00:00:47.628 --> 00:00:49.496
as the length of CE.

00:00:49.496 --> 00:00:51.272
Well CE has the length 1,

00:00:51.272 --> 00:00:53.987
so that has length 1,
and that has length 1.

00:00:54.488 --> 00:00:56.519
So what's the perimeter
of the whole polygon?

00:00:56.519 --> 00:00:58.240
Well, if we start at A let's just see,

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.939
one, two, three, four, five.

00:01:01.105 --> 00:01:02.453
It's a five-sided polygon,

00:01:02.453 --> 00:01:04.221
all of the sides have the same length,

00:01:04.221 --> 00:01:05.981
they're all exactly have a length of 1,

00:01:05.981 --> 00:01:09.425
so the perimeter is equal to 5.
