00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:08.180
My name is Jason Rezaian.

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:10.540
I'm a global opinions writer for The Washington Post.

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:13.860
And I spent 544 days in an Iranian prison.

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.320
We were preparing to go to a surprise
birthday party for my mother-in-law and

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.220
while we were getting ready to leave

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.460
back to our
apartment,

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:48.020
seized our

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.860
It was ultimate

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.760
but also a deep, deep

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:05.700
sense that

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.660
The main accusation was that I was the station

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.580
chief of the CIA in Tehran.

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.900
I thought to myself, nothing could be more ridiculous.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.580
I was placed in solitary confinement as
was my wife.

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.630
I was told consistently that

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:20.520
she and I would

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.340
within a matter of days and hours,

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.320
but other times they told me you're going to be

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.180
freed within a matter of hours.

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.460
So it was this constant

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.700
really started to to set in.

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:46.760
I could lie down in

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.780
one direction but not the other.

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.000
And there were two windows very high up near

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.660
the ceiling with bars over them

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:55.820
that I couldn't see out of ...

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.200
There was a big metal door

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.260
as you can imagine that had two holes.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.660
One at eye level that they could open the door

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:05.980
and bark orders at me ... and then

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.220
one slot down below

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.540
that they would put food in

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:12.240
twice a day as if

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.100
I was a dog.

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.720
Unknowingly did the one thing that is best for people

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.340
who experience severe trauma which was I moved,

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.680
I began pacing in my cell

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.560
thousands upon thousands of back-and-forths

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.040
between these eight-and-a-half feet of wall every day.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.940
And I worked very hard to to keep it on my side.

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.620
I tried more than anything to
make plans.

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.880
If you get in that pattern of thinking

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.820
Once you get into that narrative

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.920
it's very difficult to break out of it.

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.120
So instead, I tried to construct a narrative

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.120
of what am I gonna do after this?

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.560
But it's possible to trick your mind into

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.440
thinking things aren't as bad as they actually are.

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.140
After I came out of solitary confinement,

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.500
I went from a space where

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.000
to one where I did have some human contact.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000
Yes, most of it was with my captors.  But it wasn't that

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.300
that one experiences when they're in solitary confinement.

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:52.660
Four and a half years after that experience

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.160
I think that for the rest of my life

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.000
I will be a vocal advocate for

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:12.180
across the board because I think as a
punishment but also as as a tool to

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.700
potentially extract information from
people,

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:21.140
And I hope that it becomes

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:23.760
a relic of history in my lifetime.
