MANDY WAITE: And
I'm Andy Waite.

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:09.380
I'm a developer [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.330
for the Google Cloud platform.

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.150
We're absolutely thrilled today
to have with us Dame

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:14.220
Wendy Hall.

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.820
Wendy Hall is a professor of
computer science at University

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.440
of Southampton in the UK.

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.460
She is also the dean of the
faculty of physical sciences

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.000
and engineering.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.610
She has published over 400
papers and she is frequently

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:30.440
invited to speak
at high profile

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.290
conferences and events.

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.770
Together with Sir Tim
Berners-Lee and Nigel

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.900
Shadbolt, she co-founded the
Web Science Research

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.560
Initiative, and she's
a director of

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.410
the Web Science Trust.

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:43.630
Not only is she a Dame Commander
of the British

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.530
Empire, but she's also, I'm very
jealous here, a fellow of

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.880
the Royal Society, and she's
also a former president of the

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.490
Association of Computing
Machinery, the first person

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.690
outside of North America ever
to hold that position.

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:58.040
Welcome Wendy.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:58.420
Thank you for coming.

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.280
DAME WENDY HALL: Oh, it's
a pleasure to be here.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.580
Nice to be with you.

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.300
EMMA JACKSON: So we mentioned
in your bio that you

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.020
co-founded the world's first
inter disciplinary body to

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.200
study the structure and
sociology of the web.

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.270
Can you tell us a bit more about
what you're doing with

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.150
that organization?

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.677
DAME WENDY HALL: The
Web Science Trust?

00:02:17.677 --> 00:02:18.120
EMMA JACKSON: The Web
Science Trust.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.940
DAME WENDY HALL: Well, when we
were thinking about this back

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:27.890
in 2005, 2006, Tim, Nigel and I,
and Danny Weitzner, who is

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:33.130
a lawyer who worked with Tim at
MIT on policy and has since

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.440
been in the White House, we were
thinking about how the

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:38.290
web evolved.

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.160
And we were actually thinking
about why the semantic web

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.370
wasn't taking off.

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:49.080
Why people weren't rushing to
develop links for data, as

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.670
well as documents.

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.310
And in looking back at how
the web evolved, we

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.370
realized that we just--

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.690
despite the fact that one of
us was the inventor of the

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.460
web, we so little understood
how it happened.

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:08.500
And we also began to realize
that this wasn't just about

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:09.890
the technology.

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:13.040
It was about what people did
with the technology.

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:18.010
And in fact, what society did
with the technology over time,

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:23.050
and how the circle of the
technology goes out, people do

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:25.130
things with it, and then
the technology changes.

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.820
So there is a feedback loop.

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:31.340
And it's very different to the
way we were used to designing

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.550
computer systems.

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:37.860
And so we thought, well,
actually, it's so important

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:39.100
that we understand this.

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:40.820
It's a whole new discipline.

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.210
And it is very interdisciplinary
because we

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:45.920
need social scientists, and
technologists, and lawyers,

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.980
and economists, and business
studies, and maths and

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.620
psychology, and so many
different subjects that

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.000
impinge on this.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.700
We decided to give it a name.

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.730
We called it web science,
for good or bad.

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:59.350
Many people think we're
saying websites.

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:00.985
But it's website.

00:04:00.985 --> 00:04:03.535
And there's two things we don't
like about that name.

00:04:03.535 --> 00:04:07.120
One is web, and the other is
sites because it makes it feel

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.970
more technical than
it's meant to be.

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:14.110
And there were people start
studying this, but it didn't

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:17.170
have a name, it didn't have any
cohesion or coordination.

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:21.959
And the Web Science Research
Initiative was an agreement

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:24.930
between Southampton and MIT--

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:28.470
those two universities backed
us in developing this.

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.790
And then over the next three
years, we evolved it into the

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:35.680
Web Science Trust, which
is a Charitable Trust

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:36.530
based in the UK.

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:38.500
But it's a global reach.

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:43.670
And it's mission is to promote
awareness of websites research

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:46.020
and websites education
around the world.

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.640
And now we have a network of
50 laboratories around the

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:53.790
world who coordinate their
efforts in web science, do

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:56.880
collaborative research, and
share education experiences.

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:01.250
And many people now run
web science programs.

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:03.360
And we have an annual
conference.

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.170
Next week, it's in Paris.

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:09.830
And we run workshops and thought
leadership events, and

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:12.020
just generally raise the
awareness of what we think is

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.770
a really important paradigm
shift in the way systems are

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:20.185
developed and help us think
about how this ecosystem might

00:05:20.185 --> 00:05:21.856
evolve in the future.

00:05:21.856 --> 00:05:23.590
MANDY WAITE: OK, so in terms
of in terms of web science,

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:26.926
you've kind of been over what
the fundamentals of it are.

00:05:26.926 --> 00:05:29.220
But it's kind of like a science
such as physics or

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:32.645
chemistry, so you're applying
that to the web, and the web

00:05:32.645 --> 00:05:34.470
is constantly evolving
in front of us.

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:36.310
Things are changing, and we
don't quite understand it.

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:38.700
It's almost organic in the way
that it grows and changes, and

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:41.530
the way hot spots kind of
appear, and things change.

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:44.740
So you mentioned web
laboratories.

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:46.325
What do you do in a
web laboratory?

00:05:46.325 --> 00:05:49.330
DAME WENDY HALL: Well, this is
absolutely crucial to what's

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:57.180
happening because we've
built the system.

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:00.770
It's built by human beings.

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:03.420
But it isn't a natural system.

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:05.590
So you can't apply the laws
of biology to it.

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:08.320
So you can say it evolves, but
it doesn't evolve in the same

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:10.080
way that plants evolve--

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:10.940
or does it?

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:15.460
I mean, what are the laws
of evolution of the web?

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:19.390
And there's an engineering piece
to it because engineers

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:22.600
design the protocols that
make things happen.

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:25.310
And then some of them fail--

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:26.800
lots of them fail.

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:29.060
People try to build applications
and companies.

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:31.190
Some succeed-- lots
of them fail.

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:34.820
And in order to study this,
as you say, it's

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:35.940
evolving all the time.

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:38.190
And it's getting bigger
all the time.

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:39.560
It's a huge--

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:41.905
you can't take a snapshot and
say you understand it.

00:06:41.905 --> 00:06:45.950
And you can't take just study it
in the UK, or in China, or

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:49.090
in the US, or in
one university.

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:53.910
So you've got to do, we think,
longitudinal studies.

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:57.020
And you've got to be capturing
what's happening

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:58.500
day in and day out.

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:04.740
We talk about building web
science observatories to

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:08.050
monitor the trends,
what's emerging.

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:10.710
And it's not just about what's
happening on the web.

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:15.150
But what's the technology
development piece?

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:18.800
And what are the
policy pieces?

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:22.400
When a government changes the
law or a regulation, changes

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:25.740
its policy about something, what
impact does that have?

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:28.600
And you have to follow that
over a period of time.

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:35.460
So we've got people observing
and doing experiments with the

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:38.360
data that's being gathered about
what's going on the web.

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:44.080
But we're actually, with our
labs, and with companies that

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:47.930
are working with us, developing
this concept of web

00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:49.160
observatories.

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:52.960
And I liken it to, you know, in
order to understand climate

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:55.820
science, you have to people
around the world taking the

00:07:55.820 --> 00:08:00.390
temperature day in, day out, all
the time, how much has the

00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:01.080
ice melted.

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:03.410
They've got to be doing
that day in, day out.

00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:05.696
We have to be monitoring
the web 24/7.

00:08:05.696 --> 00:08:08.300
And people are doing that but
they're doing it and storing

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:14.540
the data on their systems,
but in silos, not shared.

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:15.200
MANDY WAITE: You mentioned.

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:15.760
DAME WENDY HALL: [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:21.210
so we want to develop protocols
and guidelines so

00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:23.650
that we can share the data
that's being collected and the

00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:27.090
tools that are being developed
to analyze that data, both in

00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:29.700
and university research
laboratories, and by

00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:31.310
companies--

00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:34.990
share the tools as much as
possible to help us build a

00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:38.190
bigger and better picture of
what's going on, and how

00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:41.679
things develop and
emerge over time.

00:08:41.679 --> 00:08:43.530
MANDY WAITE: You mentioned the
regional aspects of it--

00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:46.230
that you have to do it not just
in the UK, not just in

00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:47.530
China, but everywhere.

00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:49.240
And the cultural diversity.

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:52.000
I mean, I've used the web
in Japan and China.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.367
And it's very much significantly
different there

00:08:54.367 --> 00:08:55.740
than it is here.

00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:58.610
Is it really possible to do that
kind of study equally?

00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:01.200
Is it possible to say, it's
more like a sociological

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:03.120
study, where you have the
cultural differences between

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:04.680
people, and you have to
understand how they relate to

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:05.275
each other?

00:09:05.275 --> 00:09:07.270
But obviously, the way they use
the web is different from

00:09:07.270 --> 00:09:08.890
the way we use the web.

00:09:08.890 --> 00:09:09.980
How do you balance that?

00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:11.320
How do you get that right?

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:14.530
DAME WENDY HALL: Well, again, I
think you have to gather the

00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:16.630
data and the evidence.

00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:20.040
Otherwise, you're hypothesizing
without those

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:20.900
facts and evidence.

00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:24.440
And we have a Ph.D. program
at Southampton.

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:27.310
And we've taken our students
to other labs around the

00:09:27.310 --> 00:09:30.900
world-- to China, and Korea, and
the States, and other labs

00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:33.020
in Europe to share
experiences.

00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:37.500
And that is so powerful, to get
them to think about how

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:38.910
Twitter is used.

00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:42.320
I mean, even now in
China, they have

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:46.275
their Twitter, Weibo.

00:09:46.275 --> 00:09:52.300
And getting the students to
compare what they tweet about

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:56.430
and what are the big stories
is very insightful.

00:09:56.430 --> 00:10:00.520
And there's a huge social piece,
a social science piece,

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:04.230
understanding how
society works.

00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:09.540
And the coming together of the
social and the technical is

00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:11.550
quite difficult to manage.

00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:13.921
But that's the exciting
challenge of it.

00:10:13.921 --> 00:10:16.690
And I just love sharing the
experiences between the

00:10:16.690 --> 00:10:17.640
different cultures.

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:19.100
But we want the evidence
for that.

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:24.400
We want to collect the data for
the students to analyze.

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:26.480
EMMA JACKSON: It's a fascinating
area, yeah.

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:27.110
MANDY WAITE: It is a
fascinating area.

00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:28.790
EMMA JACKSON: I was wondering if
you think, maybe because I

00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:30.662
know you've done a lot of work
to try and encourage more

00:10:30.662 --> 00:10:34.240
girls and women to get
into this area.

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:37.080
So do you think maybe web
science is something that

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:39.040
would encourage more
diversity?

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:39.620
DAME WENDY HALL:
Well, it does.

00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:43.460
And after 30 years in the
business of computer science,

00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:47.140
it's wonderful to walk into a
classroom and have 50% of the

00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:49.690
audience women.

00:10:49.690 --> 00:10:52.280
Web science naturally attracts
women because it doesn't

00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:58.940
require people to be technically
minded in order to

00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:02.220
be involved in the work
and the study.

00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:07.670
You still need programmers in
there to build the tools that

00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:10.410
you're going to use to analyze
the data and have those

00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:11.820
technical insights.

00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:15.310
And it's that mix that's
so exciting.

00:11:15.310 --> 00:11:17.950
And our students at Southampton,
our Ph.D.

00:11:17.950 --> 00:11:21.050
Students, they come from every
different type of discipline

00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:23.470
on to the web science
Ph.D. Program.

00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:28.410
And they have to have two Ph.D.
supervisors , and at

00:11:28.410 --> 00:11:32.070
least one of those must be an
non-computer scientist.

00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:34.940
And, actually, several of the
students on the program happen

00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:37.920
two supervisors, neither of whom
are computer scientists.

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:39.800
It is not just about
the technology.

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:44.320
The insights are amazing,
what we get from that.

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:50.060
And it's just a natural that
this is a diverse group of

00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:51.560
people that want to do it.

00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:55.800
We're just launching, in
Southampton, an undergraduate

00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:57.970
program starting in October.

00:11:57.970 --> 00:12:01.060
And we've got two pathways
at the moment.

00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:05.510
These students will get a BSE
in web science, but for the

00:12:05.510 --> 00:12:08.130
moment, they can come in with
either a computer science-type

00:12:08.130 --> 00:12:10.550
background, so technical type
background, or a social

00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:15.390
science-type background and have
training in their core

00:12:15.390 --> 00:12:21.440
disciplines, and training in web
science-type fundamentals,

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:25.265
and then can weave their way to
a web science degree coming

00:12:25.265 --> 00:12:26.380
in from different backgrounds.

00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:29.480
And next year, we'll add
a management pathway.

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:32.675
And then there's going to be
a humanities pathway, and a

00:12:32.675 --> 00:12:33.430
legal pathway--

00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:34.600
oh, it's so exciting.

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:37.880
It's one of the most exciting
things I've ever done,

00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:40.250
developing this undergraduate
program.

00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:41.120
MANDY WAITE: That's interesting
that you talk

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:43.580
about the courses that are being
offered by Southampton

00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:44.500
University.

00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:47.100
Are MIT doing something
similar as well?

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:50.280
DAME WENDY HALL:
Well, no not--

00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:51.730
I mean, obviously,
they're part--

00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:56.290
because this is one of the
places it started--

00:12:56.290 --> 00:12:59.660
they're part of the web science
laboratory network.

00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:01.830
They are developing new
types of courses.

00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:07.230
But they are more on the high
school slant of things.

00:13:07.230 --> 00:13:11.310
We work very well together, so
we ask students to talk to

00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:12.800
each other.

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:15.640
MANDY WAITE: So basically, I
have this question about the

00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:17.970
courses that are being offered
by Southampton University.

00:13:17.970 --> 00:13:19.770
So you have the undergraduate
course, and then you have,

00:13:19.770 --> 00:13:22.720
also, this doctoral training
lab that offers Ph.D and

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:24.350
Master's courses.

00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:27.670
But the question would have
been, just simply, what would

00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:31.620
be the role of the web scientist
that these courses

00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:32.810
would produce.

00:13:32.810 --> 00:13:35.695
But my question, I want to
expand it now because I know

00:13:35.695 --> 00:13:36.600
when I look at physics--

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:38.950
I mean, physicists are moving
towards a certain goal.

00:13:38.950 --> 00:13:41.020
They are trying to discover the
key to the universe and to

00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:42.660
understand how the universe
evolves--

00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:44.086
DAME WENDY HALL: Well, we're
trying to discover the key to

00:13:44.086 --> 00:13:45.410
the digital universe.

00:13:45.410 --> 00:13:45.945
This is so important.

00:13:45.945 --> 00:13:46.863
MANDY WAITE: Well, exactly--
so what is the

00:13:46.863 --> 00:13:47.690
outcome of web science?

00:13:47.690 --> 00:13:50.030
DAME WENDY HALL: Well, what's
the outcome of web science?

00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:53.340
We are trying to understand
the digital universe.

00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:55.500
And our thesis is, it is a
new type of discipline.

00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:59.920
I genuinely believe that this is
as big a paradigm shift as

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:02.760
the paradigm shift that happened
in the '50s when we

00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:05.980
started developing computer
science as a subject based on

00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:08.190
the concept of Turing
machines.

00:14:08.190 --> 00:14:11.820
And now this is a
new discipline.

00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:13.710
What's happened to the internet
and the web has

00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:15.660
created a whole new
way of building

00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:16.950
and designing systems.

00:14:16.950 --> 00:14:20.380
And in fact, Tim
gave it a name.

00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:22.890
When he we wrote his book
"Weaving the Web," he talked

00:14:22.890 --> 00:14:26.980
about the type of systems that
the applications that we would

00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:29.160
be able to develop
on the web--

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:32.340
he talked about them as
being social machines.

00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:36.070
These are systems where the
machines do the administration

00:14:36.070 --> 00:14:38.970
and the people do
the creativity.

00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:39.720
And that's what we're seeing.

00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:41.410
You see, Google is
a social machine.

00:14:44.850 --> 00:14:46.820
Amazon is a social machine.

00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:48.170
Twitter is a social machine.

00:14:48.170 --> 00:14:50.280
The web itself is a
social machine.

00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:53.520
It's where you've got computers
and people working,

00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:59.240
collectively, together and using
the network effect, to

00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:05.170
create things that didn't exist
before, that couldn't

00:15:05.170 --> 00:15:07.730
exist before, like Wikipedia.

00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:09.430
It's an example of something
that's being

00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:12.180
created in that way.

00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:16.630
And understanding that creation
process is, we think,

00:15:16.630 --> 00:15:20.960
something really different to
what's happened before.

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:22.440
So I haven't really answered
your question.

00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:26.660
I've opened it up in a different
sort of way.

00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:31.300
So I think the web science
itself is trying to understand

00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:35.750
the laws, what can you say--

00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:39.270
if you think about when we
talked about different

00:15:39.270 --> 00:15:43.280
cultures, the web in the UK or
the US compared to the web in

00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:45.610
China, there are some
things that--

00:15:45.610 --> 00:15:46.930
you need search engines.

00:15:46.930 --> 00:15:48.840
Whatever you do, you need
a search engine.

00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:51.705
And the social networks
evolve.

00:15:51.705 --> 00:15:54.120
There's no stopping them, but
what people use those for are

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:58.650
very different in the
different cultures.

00:15:58.650 --> 00:16:03.865
And I think businesses need to
understand, especially, in the

00:16:03.865 --> 00:16:07.490
digital world, where you are
running a global business, and

00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:10.340
you might say, well, if I'm
going to sell this product,

00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:13.500
it'll be the same in the
US as it will in China.

00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:15.870
And it won't.

00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:19.790
But anyway, putting all these
pieces, together, so web

00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:23.460
science is the study of this
phenomenon, and trying to see

00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:27.110
if there are rules,
and theories, that

00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:29.670
you can say are givens.

00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:32.630
But then web scientists are the
sort of people that are

00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:37.400
going to help businesses and
governments understand how to

00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:41.390
work with this type of evolution
of this type of

00:16:41.390 --> 00:16:47.000
system and think about what's
going to happen in the future.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:47.790
So it won't be a black
and white science.

00:16:47.790 --> 00:16:50.950
You won't be able to say, yes,
if you do this, then that will

00:16:50.950 --> 00:16:51.730
definitely happen.

00:16:51.730 --> 00:16:53.675
But it will be, if you do this,
then that might happen.

00:16:53.675 --> 00:16:56.670
And if you don't do this, then
this will never happen.

00:16:56.670 --> 00:16:59.770
And particularly, we want to
give evidence for policy

00:16:59.770 --> 00:17:04.810
makers and big companies to
think about what their future

00:17:04.810 --> 00:17:09.069
might be as these trends emerge
and what are the good

00:17:09.069 --> 00:17:11.200
and bad things to do.

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:12.442
MANDY WAITE: Is it likely--

00:17:12.442 --> 00:17:14.109
sorry to keep asking
questions, but--

00:17:14.109 --> 00:17:15.790
DAME WENDY HALL:
No, please do.

00:17:15.790 --> 00:17:17.437
MANDY WAITE: Is it likely that
we're going to expand web

00:17:17.437 --> 00:17:19.359
science to other science
universities for

00:17:19.359 --> 00:17:21.099
that country, rapidly?

00:17:21.099 --> 00:17:23.589
I mean, is it going to be
limited to Southampton for

00:17:23.589 --> 00:17:25.494
some time, or are we going
to see this [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:25.494 --> 00:17:25.920
everywhere?

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:29.970
DAME WENDY HALL: Well,
not everybody

00:17:29.970 --> 00:17:30.920
calls it web science.

00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:33.180
There's lots happening in the
States, but they don't always

00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:36.040
call it web science.

00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:37.546
Some people call it social
computation.

00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:44.490
I just think that more and
more people are copying,

00:17:44.490 --> 00:17:45.890
mirroring, what we're doing.

00:17:45.890 --> 00:17:48.560
And as I said, we've got this
network of 14 laboratories

00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:52.300
around the world who are all
themselves web science

00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:54.270
laboratories.

00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:57.295
And they have Ph.D. programs and
are beginning to develop

00:17:57.295 --> 00:17:58.920
undergraduate programs.

00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:02.030
And there are lots of master's
programs called web science.

00:18:02.030 --> 00:18:04.980
The worrying thing is,
I looked at one.

00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:05.900
I won't name the university.

00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:11.620
It was somewhere in the States,
not one of the big--

00:18:11.620 --> 00:18:14.000
and it was advertising a
Master's in web science.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.970
And when I looked at it, it was
a computer science with

00:18:16.970 --> 00:18:18.800
one web technology module.

00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:20.530
And it's like, yeah, that's
not web science.

00:18:20.530 --> 00:18:21.950
But hey, what can you do?

00:18:21.950 --> 00:18:22.700
The cat's out of the bag.

00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:25.240
And people we'll make of
it what they will.

00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:28.160
But I know what I mean by it.

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:29.330
EMMA JACKSON: So you talk
about these sort of web

00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:32.360
scientists, I guess, that
monitor trends in technology

00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:33.250
and the web--

00:18:33.250 --> 00:18:35.380
DAME WENDY HALL: They're sort
the information scientists of

00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:36.840
the future.

00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:38.330
EMMA JACKSON: Yeah, well
I was wondering--

00:18:38.330 --> 00:18:41.500
one of the trends at the moment
is this advancement in

00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:44.530
technology to help education, in
some way, things like these

00:18:44.530 --> 00:18:45.990
massive open online courses--

00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:46.330
DAME WENDY HALL: The MOOCs.

00:18:46.330 --> 00:18:48.390
EMMA JACKSON: The MOOCs,
as they are.

00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:50.590
So, being in education yourself,
what do you think

00:18:50.590 --> 00:18:53.510
about these new advancements
and how they might change--

00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:55.820
well, you see, they are
not new, really.

00:18:55.820 --> 00:19:00.560
I cut my teeth on the use of
computers in education.

00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:03.606
And up until now, we've talked
a lot about computers were

00:19:03.606 --> 00:19:05.840
going to completely
revolutionize education.

00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:06.900
And they haven't--

00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:10.720
they have changed, for example,
everywhere you go

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:13.300
now, classrooms, universities,
are full of computers.

00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:14.450
Students use computers.

00:19:14.450 --> 00:19:15.740
They write their essays
on computers.

00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:17.220
They hand them in digitally.

00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:19.740
That talk to their
tutors by email.

00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:21.130
That has fundamentally
changed.

00:19:21.130 --> 00:19:24.000
But actually, if you want a
degree, generally speaking,

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.790
you go to a campus university
and study for a degree.

00:19:26.790 --> 00:19:29.780
That has not changed.

00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:32.150
The MOOCs are a buzzy thing.

00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:38.100
This idea that you can teach a
course using video and the

00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:41.390
self-assessment material online,
and have hundreds of

00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:44.890
thousands of people look
at it, and then get a

00:19:44.890 --> 00:19:47.730
qualification, or get certified
for that course, and

00:19:47.730 --> 00:19:50.450
then build up to a degree.

00:19:50.450 --> 00:19:57.110
And if this is really shown to
work, then that will radically

00:19:57.110 --> 00:19:59.110
change how we do education,
both in

00:19:59.110 --> 00:20:01.150
universities and schools.

00:20:01.150 --> 00:20:06.020
But there's a big sociological
piece to this.

00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:10.980
Do young teenagers need
to learn in a cohort?

00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:17.605
Do they need that psychological
encouragement of

00:20:17.605 --> 00:20:22.990
their peers and their tutors, in
a physical environment, in

00:20:22.990 --> 00:20:25.050
order to learn?

00:20:25.050 --> 00:20:28.460
You can't send somebody
to a library.

00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:30.560
I don't think you can
send a teenager to a

00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:32.340
library and say, look.

00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:34.860
They can go read a book
but they can't learn.

00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:39.930
A mature student, very different
kettle of fish.

00:20:39.930 --> 00:20:43.980
There's many master's courses
which are delivered online

00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:47.390
successfully because mature
students want to learn.

00:20:47.390 --> 00:20:49.950
They've already learned
how to learn.

00:20:49.950 --> 00:20:52.440
Either they've done a degree
before or they've worked

00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:57.370
through by learning
while they work.

00:20:57.370 --> 00:20:59.380
And they're paying for something
that they want to

00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:03.570
do, and they already have
families and stuff.

00:21:03.570 --> 00:21:08.570
But I think the jury is out
on whether that's how

00:21:08.570 --> 00:21:11.490
18-year-olds can do it.

00:21:11.490 --> 00:21:18.280
But I do think it, potentially,
does say, you no

00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:23.340
longer need to campus
university, or, dare I say it,

00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:26.060
a physical, bricks and
mortar school.

00:21:26.060 --> 00:21:29.230
But I think the universities
have really got to look at

00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:33.640
what their future is if this
technology does take hold.

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:34.630
It's very interesting.

00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:39.980
And you could say this is a web
science thing, but it's an

00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:42.350
educational thing as well.

00:21:42.350 --> 00:21:44.680
And I find the whole
thing fascinating.

00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:48.710
We are actually, just to be
incestuous, we're doing a MOOC

00:21:48.710 --> 00:21:52.370
about web science at
Southampton, which should be

00:21:52.370 --> 00:21:53.820
online in the Autumn.

00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:55.110
So we'll see how that goes.

00:21:57.820 --> 00:22:00.230
MANDY WAITE: So you, back before
the advent of the world

00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:02.760
wide web, you and the team
from the University of

00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:06.040
Southampton invented Microcosm,
which was one of

00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:08.912
the very first hypermedia
servers.

00:22:08.912 --> 00:22:11.380
And probably, can expand on what
hypermedia servers are,

00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:14.500
but it's very similar to what
we have today in the web.

00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:18.955
And at the time, you've spoken
about this in other lectures

00:22:18.955 --> 00:22:21.630
and such, like in other
speeches you've done.

00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:24.830
There was a BBC documentary
called "Hyperland" that

00:22:24.830 --> 00:22:28.645
starred Douglas Adams and
was also written by him.

00:22:28.645 --> 00:22:32.390
And it also starred the fourth
Doctor Who, Thom Baker.

00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:33.890
He played a software agent.

00:22:33.890 --> 00:22:35.390
And I think Douglas Adams
played a kind

00:22:35.390 --> 00:22:38.370
of bored couch potato.

00:22:38.370 --> 00:22:42.420
And Thom Baker introduced him
to the notion of hypermedia.

00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:44.230
DAME WENDY HALL: He introduced
him to the idea of finding

00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:47.570
anything he wanted when
he wanted it.

00:22:47.570 --> 00:22:49.310
MANDY WAITE: So Microcosm,
really, kind of,

00:22:49.310 --> 00:22:50.295
was born out of that--

00:22:50.295 --> 00:22:51.260
or at least she said.

00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:53.280
So I'm just really interested
to understand

00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:54.120
the reality of it.

00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:55.870
You've said before that it
really inspired you to go out

00:22:55.870 --> 00:22:56.750
and build microcosm.

00:22:56.750 --> 00:22:57.930
How much is that true?

00:22:57.930 --> 00:22:59.480
DAME WENDY HALL: It's
absolutely true.

00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:02.306
I was really getting into the
idea of using computers in

00:23:02.306 --> 00:23:02.980
education--

00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:06.050
this concept of multimedia,
which, in those days, was

00:23:06.050 --> 00:23:11.910
analog video, audio on tape,
text from the files, and

00:23:11.910 --> 00:23:14.010
somehow we got all that together
on one computer

00:23:14.010 --> 00:23:15.450
screen and linked it all up.

00:23:15.450 --> 00:23:18.125
And it was very primitive
compared to

00:23:18.125 --> 00:23:18.890
what we have today.

00:23:18.890 --> 00:23:20.510
But you could see
the potential.

00:23:20.510 --> 00:23:22.050
And I met the gurus
of hypertext.

00:23:22.050 --> 00:23:25.230
And I met Ted Nelson and Doug
Engelbart/ And that was the

00:23:25.230 --> 00:23:27.070
first hypertext conference,
[INAUDIBLE] hypertext

00:23:27.070 --> 00:23:28.230
conference in 1987.

00:23:28.230 --> 00:23:31.380
There was a very sort
of timely--

00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:33.370
there was a time when this
was all emerging.

00:23:33.370 --> 00:23:38.230
At the same time, in CERN, Tim
was this inventing the web.

00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:42.400
And that "Hyperland" video
was released in 1987.

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:46.020
That was the year that Apple
released Hypercard.

00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:50.470
And I watched the TV program.

00:23:50.470 --> 00:23:52.630
And I thought, I want to build
a system like that.

00:23:52.630 --> 00:23:56.270
I want to build a system with a
software agent that helps me

00:23:56.270 --> 00:23:59.340
find the information I
want when I want it.

00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:02.780
And I'm convinced that
hypertext, hypermedia, is

00:24:02.780 --> 00:24:04.470
crucial to this.

00:24:04.470 --> 00:24:07.910
And so we set about developing
this system, Microcosm--

00:24:07.910 --> 00:24:09.240
it wasn't the first.

00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:12.170
There had been hypertext
systems for a couple of

00:24:12.170 --> 00:24:13.580
decades before that.

00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:18.310
But what we did with Microcosm
was, we stored the links

00:24:18.310 --> 00:24:19.670
separately from the documents.

00:24:19.670 --> 00:24:20.920
They were first-class
entities.

00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:24.960
And they had meaning.

00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:27.470
They weren't just point
to point links.

00:24:27.470 --> 00:24:31.250
The information encoded
to them said why

00:24:31.250 --> 00:24:32.790
that link was created.

00:24:32.790 --> 00:24:35.860
So it was a precursor to the
semantic web, actually.

00:24:35.860 --> 00:24:41.830
But what we got wrong, what
Tim taught me, was A, this

00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:44.910
stuff works if-- either
nobody will use it or

00:24:44.910 --> 00:24:45.720
everybody will use it.

00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:47.920
And so it's going to work
over the network.

00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:51.250
It's going to be
open and free.

00:24:51.250 --> 00:24:56.670
And to the protocols, the
standards have got to be open.

00:24:56.670 --> 00:24:59.180
Microcosm was proprietary.

00:24:59.180 --> 00:25:02.635
And so those were the
things that Tim got

00:25:02.635 --> 00:25:05.130
right with the web.

00:25:05.130 --> 00:25:10.020
Give it away, open protocols,
on the network.

00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:14.810
And so we got a lot of that
wrong with Microcosm.

00:25:14.810 --> 00:25:19.810
But we did get the idea of
having intelligent linking.

00:25:19.810 --> 00:25:24.050
And that's really what's
exciting, for me, about what's

00:25:24.050 --> 00:25:27.240
happening now is that's
the semantic web.

00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:30.160
And that's what we're
seeing emerge today.

00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:32.450
So it's about 20 years--

00:25:32.450 --> 00:25:34.530
or more--

00:25:34.530 --> 00:25:37.580
22, 23 years since we first
of did Microcosm.

00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:40.030
It's exciting to
see those ideas

00:25:40.030 --> 00:25:42.165
emerging in today's work.

00:25:42.165 --> 00:25:44.440
MANDY WAITE: Yeah,
definitely yeah.

00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:47.790
EMMA JACKSON: So in today's
web, what excites you in

00:25:47.790 --> 00:25:49.540
technology at the moment?

00:25:49.540 --> 00:25:51.590
DAME WENDY HALL: Well, I think
we are seeing the semantic web

00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:55.440
emerge-- the web of data, Web
3.0, the idea that we're not

00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:57.690
just thinking documents,
we're linking data.

00:25:57.690 --> 00:25:59.760
And we're linking data in such
a way that there's that

00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:02.810
meaning about why that
link is there.

00:26:02.810 --> 00:26:05.260
That means you've got to, of
course, you have to tag them.

00:26:05.260 --> 00:26:06.900
You've got to explain what--
you've got to say what the

00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:07.590
data's about.

00:26:07.590 --> 00:26:09.130
You have to have ontologies.

00:26:09.130 --> 00:26:11.660
But you can do in a
very simple way.

00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:16.080
And we are really beginning to
see that emerge with, Google's

00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:17.950
got its knowledge tree.

00:26:17.950 --> 00:26:22.040
And that's really exciting.

00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:23.860
The other exciting thing, of
course, it's all happening in

00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:25.660
the mobile world.

00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:29.550
And the 80% of the world that
isn't on the internet is

00:26:29.550 --> 00:26:32.740
getting on the internet through
the mobile technology.

00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:41.180
So we're seeing another whole
scale up of this amazing

00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:43.720
ecosystem that we've
developed.

00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:48.640
And I think that it's changed
the world already, but we

00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:52.080
haven't seen anything yet.

00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:52.830
MANDY WAITE: I did have a
sweepstake about how many

00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:55.550
times you would use
the word ontology.

00:26:55.550 --> 00:26:57.490
DAME WENDY HALL: Once.

00:26:57.490 --> 00:26:58.450
I tried not to.

00:26:58.450 --> 00:27:00.130
MANDY WAITE: Because web
scientists, generally, are

00:27:00.130 --> 00:27:01.490
very averse to using
the word ontology.

00:27:01.490 --> 00:27:03.010
Why is that?

00:27:03.010 --> 00:27:04.630
DAME WENDY HALL: Well, I think
because it seems to sort of

00:27:04.630 --> 00:27:07.451
overcomplicates the issue.

00:27:07.451 --> 00:27:10.610
And you you don't have to
develop a perfect ontology in

00:27:10.610 --> 00:27:13.380
order to share linking
information--

00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:15.840
share information.

00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:16.796
MANDY WAITE: I think the
semantic web probably explains

00:27:16.796 --> 00:27:17.390
it a bit better.

00:27:17.390 --> 00:27:20.990
I think even in semantic web, it
might still be a little too

00:27:20.990 --> 00:27:23.010
complicated for people
to understand.

00:27:23.010 --> 00:27:24.230
So is there a better way we
can actually frame it?

00:27:24.230 --> 00:27:25.620
DAME WENDY HALL: Well, I've
talked about the intelligent

00:27:25.620 --> 00:27:26.860
web, really.

00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:32.226
And so, nowadays, if you look
for something, you use a

00:27:32.226 --> 00:27:34.290
search engine like Google, you
get a list of links back.

00:27:34.290 --> 00:27:36.400
In the future, we'll look for
something, and we'll get the

00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:39.050
information that we wanted
to answer the

00:27:39.050 --> 00:27:40.470
question that we had.

00:27:40.470 --> 00:27:42.920
MANDY WAITE: It'll
be contextual.

00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:43.470
I have an idea.

00:27:43.470 --> 00:27:46.331
You could call web
science webology.

00:27:46.331 --> 00:27:47.570
DAME WENDY HALL: Actually,
it was one of the

00:27:47.570 --> 00:27:48.750
things we went through.

00:27:48.750 --> 00:27:51.626
But we decided that didn't
sound serious enough.

00:27:51.626 --> 00:27:53.060
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:53.060 --> 00:27:54.972
EMMA JACKSON: -ology,
that's good.

00:27:54.972 --> 00:27:56.884
DAME WENDY HALL: We did,
that was on our--

00:27:59.770 --> 00:28:01.740
Tim wanted to call it
philosophical engineering.

00:28:01.740 --> 00:28:02.650
MANDY WAITE: Oh, no.

00:28:02.650 --> 00:28:03.470
EMMA JACKSON: That
would be wild.

00:28:03.470 --> 00:28:05.910
DAME WENDY HALL: Yeah, and we
decided people wouldn't

00:28:05.910 --> 00:28:06.560
understand what.

00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:09.074
But that's what it
actually is.

00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:14.260
EMMA JACKSON: Well,
thank you so much.

00:28:14.260 --> 00:28:15.350
DAME WENDY HALL:
Is the time up?

00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:16.435
MANDY WAITE: Well, we can
talk about more--

00:28:16.435 --> 00:28:18.190
what other questions
do we have?

00:28:18.190 --> 00:28:19.432
[INAUDIBLE]

00:28:19.432 --> 00:28:21.120
EMMA JACKSON: I think yeah.

00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:24.210
MANDY WAITE: OK, guess so.

00:28:24.210 --> 00:28:25.050
Thank you for coming today.

00:28:25.050 --> 00:28:26.565
It's been wonderful
having you here.

00:28:26.565 --> 00:28:28.410
And I learned about web science
because web science

00:28:28.410 --> 00:28:29.950
had been new to me anyway.

00:28:29.950 --> 00:28:32.310
So it's been a really real
experience and a joy,

00:28:32.310 --> 00:28:34.290
actually, watching you
talk about it.

00:28:34.290 --> 00:28:34.810
DAME WENDY HALL: It's been
fantastic to have the

00:28:34.810 --> 00:28:36.270
opportunity to talk about it.

00:28:36.270 --> 00:28:38.595
I should add that,
as I said to you

00:28:38.595 --> 00:28:41.360
before, it doesn't mean--

00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:43.260
I don't always want women
to do computer science.

00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:45.540
I think it's really important
that we get women into

00:28:45.540 --> 00:28:46.260
computer science.

00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:49.000
And it's such an uphill
battle for us.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:52.060
We need to look to the countries
like the Far East

00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:56.830
and India, where women aspire
to be computer scientists.

00:28:56.830 --> 00:28:58.130
We don't have that
culture here.

00:28:58.130 --> 00:29:02.970
And we somehow need
to get that buzz.

00:29:02.970 --> 00:29:07.637
And I'm hopeful, but I don't
have that problem with web

00:29:07.637 --> 00:29:09.530
science because this is
something that women naturally

00:29:09.530 --> 00:29:12.330
want to study, so that's--

00:29:12.330 --> 00:29:13.530
[? MANDY WAITE: Oh, again, ?]
but women [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:13.530 --> 00:29:18.300
it's a kind of clever way at try
to present more models to

00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:18.630
young women--

00:29:18.630 --> 00:29:20.130
EMMA JACKSON: Yeah,
such as yourself.

00:29:20.130 --> 00:29:20.610
Yeah.

00:29:20.610 --> 00:29:22.290
MANDY WAITE: Such as
yourself, yeah.

00:29:22.290 --> 00:29:22.990
So hopefully, we're
doing that.

00:29:22.990 --> 00:29:24.910
And thank you for
coming on today.

00:29:24.910 --> 00:29:26.100
It's been really wonderful
to talk to you.

00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:26.410
EMMA JACKSON: Yeah, I've
enjoyed it so much.

00:29:26.410 --> 00:29:27.180
DAME WENDY HALL: My pleasure.

00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:29.050
MANDY WAITE: And thanks
to Emma, thanks to

00:29:29.050 --> 00:29:30.130
our producer Ian.

00:29:30.130 --> 00:29:31.550
And this was "Women

00:29:31.550 --> 00:29:33.080
Techmakers," from campus London.

00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:35.430
We'll hopefully have another
event for you soon.

00:29:35.430 --> 00:29:38.120
In the meantime, good-bye.

00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:39.370
DAME WENDY HALL: Bye.
