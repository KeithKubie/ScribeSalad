00:00:12.667 --> 00:00:14.762
A few years ago, about seven years ago,

00:00:14.786 --> 00:00:18.535
I found myself hiding
in a festival toilet,

00:00:18.559 --> 00:00:20.358
a music festival toilet,

00:00:20.382 --> 00:00:23.509
and if anyone's been to a music festival,

00:00:23.533 --> 00:00:27.454
yeah, you'll know that by the third day,

00:00:27.478 --> 00:00:29.167
it's pretty nasty.

00:00:29.191 --> 00:00:32.477
I was standing in the toilet
because I couldn't even sit down,

00:00:32.501 --> 00:00:35.184
because the toilet roll had run out,

00:00:35.208 --> 00:00:36.652
there was mud everywhere,

00:00:36.676 --> 00:00:38.101
and it smelled pretty bad.

00:00:38.125 --> 00:00:39.902
And I stood there thinking,

00:00:39.926 --> 00:00:42.934
"What am I doing?
I don't even need the toilet."

00:00:42.958 --> 00:00:44.316
But the reason I went

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.776
was because I was volunteering
for a large charity on climate justice,

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.708
and it was seven years ago,

00:00:50.732 --> 00:00:53.223
when lots of people didn't believe
in climate change,

00:00:53.247 --> 00:00:55.152
people were very cynical about activism,

00:00:55.176 --> 00:00:57.034
and my role, with all of my teammates,

00:00:57.058 --> 00:01:00.059
was to get people to sign petitions
on climate justice

00:01:00.083 --> 00:01:02.637
and educate them
a bit more about the issue.

00:01:02.661 --> 00:01:06.558
And I cared deeply about climate change
and lots of inequality,

00:01:06.582 --> 00:01:08.535
so I'd go and I'd talk to lots of people,

00:01:08.559 --> 00:01:11.789
which made me nervous
and drained me of energy,

00:01:11.813 --> 00:01:13.638
but I did it because I cared,

00:01:13.662 --> 00:01:17.567
but I would hide in the toilets,
because I'd be exhausted,

00:01:17.591 --> 00:01:21.536
and I didn't want my teammates
doubting my commitment to the cause,

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.441
thinking that I was slacking.

00:01:23.465 --> 00:01:25.608
And we'd go and meet
at the end of our shift,

00:01:25.632 --> 00:01:27.997
and we'd count how many petitions
had been signed,

00:01:28.021 --> 00:01:30.688
and often I'd win the amount
of petitions signed

00:01:30.712 --> 00:01:33.251
even though I had
my little breaks in the toilet.

00:01:33.275 --> 00:01:36.022
But I was always very jealous
of the other activists,

00:01:36.046 --> 00:01:38.410
because either they had
the same amount of energy

00:01:38.434 --> 00:01:43.109
as they had when they began the shift
of getting people to sign petitions,

00:01:43.133 --> 00:01:45.077
or often they had more energy,

00:01:45.101 --> 00:01:48.602
and they'd be really excited about
going to watch the bands in the evening

00:01:48.626 --> 00:01:49.800
and having a dance.

00:01:49.824 --> 00:01:51.935
And even if I loved the bands,

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:55.094
all I wanted to do was to go back
to my tent and have a sleep,

00:01:55.118 --> 00:01:57.785
because I'd just feel
completely wiped out,

00:01:57.809 --> 00:02:00.366
and I was really jealous of people
that had the energy

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.920
to go and party hard at the festivals.

00:02:03.703 --> 00:02:06.615
But it also made me really angry,
as well, inside.

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:09.561
I thought, "This isn't fair,
I'm an introvert,

00:02:09.585 --> 00:02:14.505
and all of the offline campaigning
seems to be favoring extroverts."

00:02:15.034 --> 00:02:17.232
I would go on marches which drained me.

00:02:17.256 --> 00:02:18.518
That was the other option.

00:02:18.542 --> 00:02:22.943
Or I'd go and join campaigns
outside embassies or shops.

00:02:22.967 --> 00:02:25.912
The only thing that was on offer
was around lots of people,

00:02:25.936 --> 00:02:27.888
it was very loud activism,

00:02:27.912 --> 00:02:30.935
it always involved lots of people,
it was performing.

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.190
None of it was for introverts,

00:02:33.214 --> 00:02:35.857
and I not only thought
that that wasn't fair,

00:02:35.881 --> 00:02:40.707
because a third to a half
of the world's population are introverts,

00:02:40.731 --> 00:02:43.746
which isn't fair on them,
because we burn out,

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:46.327
or we'd be put off
by activism and not do it,

00:02:46.351 --> 00:02:50.106
and everyone needs to be
an activist in this world.

00:02:50.414 --> 00:02:53.056
And also, I didn't think
it was particularly clever,

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.811
but I could see that a lot
of the activism that worked

00:02:56.835 --> 00:02:59.082
wasn't only extrovert activism.

00:02:59.106 --> 00:03:00.851
It wasn't only the loud stuff.

00:03:00.875 --> 00:03:03.764
It wasn't about people
performing all the time.

00:03:03.788 --> 00:03:06.409
A lot of the work that was needed
was in the background,

00:03:06.433 --> 00:03:08.375
was hidden, wasn't seen.

00:03:09.031 --> 00:03:11.419
And when I ended up
just being a campaigner,

00:03:11.443 --> 00:03:13.562
because it's the only job
I can do, really --

00:03:13.586 --> 00:03:15.301
I was campaigning at university,

00:03:15.325 --> 00:03:18.357
and for the last 10 years,
I've been a professional campaigner

00:03:18.381 --> 00:03:19.548
for large charities,

00:03:19.572 --> 00:03:23.421
and now I'm a creative campaigner
consultant for different charities

00:03:23.445 --> 00:03:25.709
as well as other work I do --

00:03:25.733 --> 00:03:28.945
but I knew that there were other forms
of activism that were needed.

00:03:29.607 --> 00:03:32.163
I started tinkering about seven years ago

00:03:32.187 --> 00:03:35.941
to see what quieter forms of activism
I could engage with

00:03:35.965 --> 00:03:38.242
so I didn't burn out as an activist,

00:03:38.266 --> 00:03:43.028
but also to look at some of the issues
I was concerned about in campaigning.

00:03:43.052 --> 00:03:46.482
I was very lucky that, when I worked
for Oxfam and other big charities,

00:03:46.506 --> 00:03:48.704
I could read lots of big reports

00:03:48.728 --> 00:03:51.982
on what influenced
politicians and businesses

00:03:52.006 --> 00:03:53.697
and the general public,

00:03:53.721 --> 00:03:56.199
what campaigns worked really well,
which ones didn't.

00:03:56.223 --> 00:03:59.158
And I'm a bit of a geek,
so I look at all of that stuff,

00:03:59.182 --> 00:04:00.564
and I wanted to tinker around

00:04:00.588 --> 00:04:04.453
to see how I could engage people
in social change in a different way,

00:04:04.477 --> 00:04:09.072
because I think if we want the world
to be more beautiful, kind and just,

00:04:09.096 --> 00:04:12.889
then our activism
should be beautiful, kind and just,

00:04:12.913 --> 00:04:14.278
and often it's not.

00:04:14.723 --> 00:04:17.063
And today, I just want to talk
about three ways

00:04:17.087 --> 00:04:19.158
that I think activism needs introverts.

00:04:19.597 --> 00:04:23.081
I think there's lot of other ways,
but I'm just going to talk about three.

00:04:23.731 --> 00:04:27.747
And the first one is:
activism is often very quick,

00:04:27.771 --> 00:04:29.081
and it's about doing,

00:04:29.105 --> 00:04:32.360
so extroverts, often their immediate
response to injustice is,

00:04:32.384 --> 00:04:33.844
we've got to do stuff now,

00:04:33.868 --> 00:04:35.678
we've got to react really quickly --

00:04:35.702 --> 00:04:37.317
and yes, we do need to react,

00:04:37.341 --> 00:04:39.937
but we need to be strategic
in our campaigning,

00:04:39.961 --> 00:04:41.587
and if we just act on anger,

00:04:41.611 --> 00:04:43.285
often we do the wrong things.

00:04:44.177 --> 00:04:46.805
I use craft, like needlework --

00:04:46.829 --> 00:04:48.908
like this guy behind me is doing --

00:04:48.932 --> 00:04:52.766
as a way to not only slow down
those extrovert doers,

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:58.548
but also to bring in nervous,
quiet introverts into activism.

00:04:59.216 --> 00:05:01.727
By doing repetitive actions,

00:05:01.751 --> 00:05:04.765
like handicraft, you can't do it fast,
you have to do it slowly.

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:06.500
And those repetitive stitches

00:05:06.524 --> 00:05:10.588
help you meditate on the big,
complex, messy social change issues

00:05:10.612 --> 00:05:12.960
and figure out what we can do

00:05:12.984 --> 00:05:18.389
as a citizen, as a consumer,
as a constituent,

00:05:18.413 --> 00:05:20.397
and all of those different things.

00:05:20.421 --> 00:05:23.818
It helps you think critically
while you're stitching away,

00:05:23.842 --> 00:05:26.558
and it helps you be more mindful
of what are your motives.

00:05:26.582 --> 00:05:29.930
Are you that Barbie aid worker
that was mentioned before?

00:05:29.954 --> 00:05:32.605
Are you about joining
people in solidarity,

00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:35.805
or do you want to be the savior,
which often isn't very ethical?

00:05:35.829 --> 00:05:38.177
But doing needle work together, as well,

00:05:38.201 --> 00:05:41.868
extroverts and introverts and ambivert --

00:05:41.892 --> 00:05:44.115
everyone's on the scale
in different places --

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:48.893
because it's a quiet,
slow form of activism,

00:05:48.917 --> 00:05:51.687
it really helps introverts be heard

00:05:51.711 --> 00:05:55.579
in other areas, where
they are often not heard.

00:05:55.603 --> 00:05:58.253
It sounds odd,

00:05:58.277 --> 00:06:01.905
but while you're stitching,
you don't need eye contact with people.

00:06:01.929 --> 00:06:04.041
So, for nervous introverts,

00:06:04.065 --> 00:06:08.255
it means that you can stitch away
next to someone or a group of people

00:06:08.279 --> 00:06:10.478
and ask questions that you're thinking

00:06:10.502 --> 00:06:13.565
that often you don't
get time to ask people,

00:06:13.589 --> 00:06:16.486
or you're too nervous to ask
if you give them eye contact.

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:19.462
So you can get introverts,
who are those big, deep thinkers,

00:06:19.486 --> 00:06:22.653
saying, "That's really interesting
that you want to do

00:06:22.677 --> 00:06:25.893
that extrovert form of activism
that's about shaming people

00:06:25.917 --> 00:06:27.608
or quickly going out somewhere,

00:06:27.632 --> 00:06:29.806
but who are you trying to target and how,

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:31.759
and is that the best way to do it?"

00:06:31.783 --> 00:06:34.830
So it means you could have
these discussions in a very slow way,

00:06:34.854 --> 00:06:37.831
which is great for the extrovert
to slow down and think deeply,

00:06:37.855 --> 00:06:40.062
but it's really good
for the introvert as well,

00:06:40.086 --> 00:06:43.641
to be heard and to feel
part of that movement for change,

00:06:43.665 --> 00:06:44.816
in a good way.

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:47.222
Some ways we do it is stitch cards

00:06:47.246 --> 00:06:50.309
about what values we thread
through our activism,

00:06:50.333 --> 00:06:53.841
and making sure that we don't
just react in unethical ways.

00:06:53.865 --> 00:06:56.675
One, sometimes we work
with art institutions

00:06:56.699 --> 00:06:59.771
where we will get
over 150 people at the V&amp;A

00:06:59.795 --> 00:07:01.245
who can come for hours,

00:07:01.269 --> 00:07:03.706
sit and stitch together
on a particular issue,

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:07.191
and then tweet what they're thinking
or how it went, like this one.

00:07:07.727 --> 00:07:10.950
Also, I always think
that activism needs introverts

00:07:10.974 --> 00:07:13.989
because we're really good
at intimate activism.

00:07:14.013 --> 00:07:15.640
So we're good at slow activism,

00:07:15.664 --> 00:07:17.950
and we're really good
at intimate activism,

00:07:17.974 --> 00:07:19.816
and if this year has told us anything,

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:23.681
it's told us that we need to,
when we're engaging power holders,

00:07:23.705 --> 00:07:27.015
we need to engage them by listening
to people we disagree with,

00:07:27.039 --> 00:07:29.145
by building bridges not walls --

00:07:29.169 --> 00:07:31.951
walls or wars --

00:07:31.975 --> 00:07:34.879
and by being critical friends,
not aggressive enemies.

00:07:35.371 --> 00:07:38.245
And one example
that I do a lot with introverts,

00:07:38.269 --> 00:07:39.420
but with lots of people,

00:07:39.444 --> 00:07:41.530
is make gifts for people in power,

00:07:41.554 --> 00:07:44.158
so not be outside screaming at them,

00:07:44.182 --> 00:07:47.086
but to give them something
like a bespoke handkerchief

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:48.445
saying, "Don't blow it.

00:07:48.469 --> 00:07:49.976
Use your power for good.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.151
We know you've got a difficult job
in your position of power.

00:07:53.175 --> 00:07:54.913
How can we help you?"

00:07:54.937 --> 00:07:57.652
And what's great is, for the introverts,

00:07:57.676 --> 00:08:00.112
we can write letters
while we're making these gifts,

00:08:00.136 --> 00:08:02.509
so for us, Marks and Spencer,

00:08:02.533 --> 00:08:06.954
we tried to campaign to get them
to implement the living wage.

00:08:06.978 --> 00:08:11.020
So we made all the 14 board members
bespoke handkerchiefs.

00:08:11.044 --> 00:08:13.336
We wrote them letters, we boxed them up,

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:16.393
and we went to the AGM
to hand-deliver our gifts

00:08:16.417 --> 00:08:18.913
and to have that form of intimate activism

00:08:18.937 --> 00:08:20.678
where we had discussions with them.

00:08:21.107 --> 00:08:24.290
And what was brilliant
was that the chair of the board

00:08:24.314 --> 00:08:26.266
told us how amazing our campaign was,

00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:27.726
how heartfelt it was.

00:08:28.153 --> 00:08:30.257
The board members, like Martha Lane Fox,

00:08:30.281 --> 00:08:33.185
who has hundreds of thousands
of followers on Twitter,

00:08:33.209 --> 00:08:35.487
and highly influential in business,

00:08:35.511 --> 00:08:37.535
tweeted how impressed she was,

00:08:37.559 --> 00:08:39.146
and within 10 months,

00:08:39.170 --> 00:08:41.726
we'd had meetings with Marks and Spencer

00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:45.290
to say, "We know this is difficult
to be a living wage employer,

00:08:45.314 --> 00:08:46.663
but if you can be one,

00:08:46.687 --> 00:08:48.546
the rest of the sector will look at it,

00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:53.172
and it's not right that some of your
amazing workers are working full time

00:08:53.196 --> 00:08:54.735
and still can't pay their bills.

00:08:54.759 --> 00:08:56.259
And we love Marks and Spencer.

00:08:56.283 --> 00:08:58.989
How can you be the role model
that we want you to be?"

00:08:59.829 --> 00:09:01.838
So that was that intimate
form of activism.

00:09:01.862 --> 00:09:04.163
We had lots of meetings with them.

00:09:04.187 --> 00:09:08.686
We then gave them Christmas cards
and Valentine's cards to say,

00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:12.013
"We really want to encourage you
to implement the living wage,

00:09:12.037 --> 00:09:14.845
and within 10 months,
they'd announced to the media

00:09:14.869 --> 00:09:18.735
that they were going to pay
the independent living wage, and now --

00:09:18.759 --> 00:09:20.568
(Applause)

00:09:20.592 --> 00:09:21.743
Thank you.

00:09:21.767 --> 00:09:25.306
And now we're trying
to work with them to be accredited,

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:26.609
which is really important,

00:09:26.633 --> 00:09:29.085
and we went back to the last AGM this June

00:09:29.109 --> 00:09:32.705
and we had these amazing one-to-one
discussions with the board members,

00:09:32.729 --> 00:09:34.826
who told us how much
they loved their hankies

00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:37.724
and how it really moved them,
what we were doing,

00:09:37.748 --> 00:09:41.212
and they all told us that if we were
standing outside screaming at them

00:09:41.236 --> 00:09:43.356
and not being gentle in our protest,

00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:45.257
they wouldn't have even listened to us,

00:09:45.281 --> 00:09:47.308
never mind had those discussions with us.

00:09:47.332 --> 00:09:50.690
And I think introverts
are really good at intimate activism

00:09:50.714 --> 00:09:52.055
because we like to listen,

00:09:52.079 --> 00:09:53.436
we like one-to-ones,

00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:54.807
we don't like small talks,

00:09:54.831 --> 00:09:58.357
we like those big, juicy issues
to discuss with people,

00:09:58.381 --> 00:09:59.897
we don't like conflict,

00:09:59.921 --> 00:10:01.688
so we avoid it at all costs,

00:10:01.712 --> 00:10:05.001
which is really important when
we're trying to engage power holders,

00:10:05.025 --> 00:10:08.195
not to be conflicting
with them all the time.

00:10:08.632 --> 00:10:13.326
The third way I think activists
are really missing out

00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:15.220
if they don't engage introverts

00:10:15.244 --> 00:10:20.275
is that introverts, like I said,
can be half of the world's population,

00:10:20.299 --> 00:10:23.403
and most of us won't say
that we're introvert,

00:10:23.427 --> 00:10:26.621
or we get embarrassed
by saying what overwhelms us.

00:10:26.645 --> 00:10:28.646
So for me, a few years ago,

00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:31.763
my mom used to send me
texts in capital letters --

00:10:31.787 --> 00:10:34.937
and she can now do emojis
and everything, she's fine --

00:10:34.961 --> 00:10:36.740
but as soon as I'd see this text,

00:10:36.764 --> 00:10:40.384
I'd wince and think, "Ooh,
it's capital letters, it's too much."

00:10:40.408 --> 00:10:43.590
And I'd have to ignore it to read
the lovely text she sent me.

00:10:43.614 --> 00:10:45.097
And that's a bit embarrassing,

00:10:45.121 --> 00:10:48.233
to tell people that capital
letters overwhelm you,

00:10:48.257 --> 00:10:53.266
but we really need introverts
to help us do intriguing activism

00:10:53.290 --> 00:10:55.853
that attracts them
rather than puts them off.

00:10:55.877 --> 00:10:59.330
We're put off by big
and brash giant posters

00:10:59.354 --> 00:11:01.862
and capital letters and explanation marks

00:11:01.886 --> 00:11:05.308
telling us what to do
and vying for our attention.

00:11:05.332 --> 00:11:09.130
So some of the things I do with people
around the world who take part

00:11:09.154 --> 00:11:11.496
is make small bits
of provocative street art

00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:14.162
which are hung off eye level, very small,

00:11:14.186 --> 00:11:15.964
and they're provocative messages.

00:11:15.988 --> 00:11:19.273
They're not preaching at people
or telling them what to do.

00:11:19.297 --> 00:11:21.931
They're just getting people
to engage in different ways,

00:11:21.955 --> 00:11:23.146
and think for themselves,

00:11:23.170 --> 00:11:25.296
because we don't like
to be told what to do.

00:11:25.921 --> 00:11:28.374
It might be wearing
a green heart on your sleeve

00:11:28.398 --> 00:11:31.295
saying what you love
and how climate change will affect it,

00:11:31.319 --> 00:11:32.477
and we'll wear it,

00:11:32.501 --> 00:11:33.683
and if people say,

00:11:33.707 --> 00:11:37.041
"Why are you wearing a green heart
with the word 'chocolate' on?"

00:11:37.065 --> 00:11:40.231
and we can have those one-to-one
intimate conversations and say,

00:11:40.255 --> 00:11:41.446
"I love chocolate.

00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:43.712
Climate change is going to affect it,

00:11:43.736 --> 00:11:47.183
and I think there's lot of other things
that climate change will affect,

00:11:47.207 --> 00:11:50.750
and I really want to make sure I'm part
of the solution, not the problem."

00:11:50.774 --> 00:11:54.353
And then we deflect, because we don't
like to be the center of attention,

00:11:54.377 --> 00:11:57.504
and say, "What do you love
and how will climate change affect it?"

00:11:58.071 --> 00:12:00.834
Or it might be shop-dropping
instead of shop-lifting,

00:12:00.858 --> 00:12:04.715
where we'll make little mini-scrolls
with lovely stories on

00:12:04.739 --> 00:12:07.097
about what's the story
behind your clothes.

00:12:07.121 --> 00:12:11.097
Is it a joyful story of how it's made,
or is it a torturous one?

00:12:11.121 --> 00:12:13.918
And we'll just drop them
in little pockets in shops,

00:12:13.942 --> 00:12:16.177
all lowercase, all handwritten,

00:12:16.201 --> 00:12:19.551
with kisses and smiley faces in ribbon,

00:12:19.575 --> 00:12:22.173
and then people are excited
that they found it.

00:12:22.197 --> 00:12:24.559
And we often drop them in unethical shops

00:12:24.583 --> 00:12:26.677
or in front pockets,

00:12:26.701 --> 00:12:29.946
and it's a way that we can do
offline campaigning

00:12:29.970 --> 00:12:32.431
that engages us and doesn't burn us out,

00:12:32.455 --> 00:12:37.711
but also engages other people
in an intriguing way online and offline.

00:12:39.061 --> 00:12:42.209
So I've got two calls to action,

00:12:42.233 --> 00:12:45.218
for the introverts and for the extroverts.

00:12:45.242 --> 00:12:46.741
For the ambivert,

00:12:46.765 --> 00:12:48.146
you're involved in all of it.

00:12:49.055 --> 00:12:54.001
For the extroverts, I want to say
that when you're planning a campaign,

00:12:54.025 --> 00:12:55.541
think about introverts.

00:12:55.565 --> 00:12:59.461
Think about how valuable our skills are,
just as much as extroverts'.

00:13:00.017 --> 00:13:02.776
We're good at slowing down
and thinking deeply,

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:05.993
and the detail of issues,
we're really good at bringing them out.

00:13:06.673 --> 00:13:10.728
We're good at intimate activism,
so use us in that way.

00:13:10.752 --> 00:13:13.045
And we're good at intriguing people

00:13:13.069 --> 00:13:17.779
by doing strange little things that help
create conversations and thought.

00:13:17.803 --> 00:13:20.999
Introverts, my call to action for you is,

00:13:21.023 --> 00:13:22.801
I know you like being on your own,

00:13:22.825 --> 00:13:24.676
I know you like being in your head,

00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:26.597
but activism needs you,

00:13:26.621 --> 00:13:28.653
so sometimes you've got to get out there.

00:13:28.677 --> 00:13:32.011
It doesn't mean that you've got
to turn into an extrovert and burn out,

00:13:32.035 --> 00:13:33.607
because that's no use for anyone,

00:13:33.631 --> 00:13:34.828
but what it does mean

00:13:34.852 --> 00:13:38.796
is that you should value the skills
and the traits that you have

00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:40.272
that activism needs.

00:13:40.835 --> 00:13:42.399
So for everyone in this room,

00:13:42.423 --> 00:13:46.232
whether you're an extrovert
or an introvert or an ambivert,

00:13:46.256 --> 00:13:49.137
the world needs you now more than ever,

00:13:49.161 --> 00:13:51.494
and you've got no excuse
not to get involved.

00:13:51.922 --> 00:13:53.073
Thanks.

00:13:53.097 --> 00:13:56.309
(Applause)
