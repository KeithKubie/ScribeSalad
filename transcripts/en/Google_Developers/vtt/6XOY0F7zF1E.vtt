LOUIS GRAY: Welcome to Google
Developers Weekly for

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:11.260
September 16, 2013.

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:13.490
I'm Louis Gray, and this is our
highlight reel of what's

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:15.340
happening in the world
of Google Developers

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:17.360
on the set and off.

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.340
While the weather here in sunny
Mountain View has been

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.850
pleasant, our GDL studios were
dominated by clouds last week.

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.620
Google's cloud platform team
delivered four separate videos

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:29.290
for you cumulus and stratus
aficionados.

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:31.670
Starting first with the core
benefits of the platform,

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:33.350
including rapid compute
scaling and

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:35.350
large scale data analytics.

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:37.820
The video series also includes
case studies from companies

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.750
like Rovio and Shutterfly,
letting us hear how they can

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.070
easily deploy what would
otherwise be a complex

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.760
infrastructure and reduced
latency while scaling to meet

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.840
spikes in user demand.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.870
Google's mission is to make
the world's information

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.210
universally accessible
and useful.

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.040
That includes making content on
the web accessible to blind

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.550
in low vision users.

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.470
Internet pioneer Vint Cerf, TV
Raman and others from Google's

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:02.620
accessibility team, join us in
the GDL Studio to kick off the

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.590
web accessibility MOOC.

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:07.920
And as promised last week, the
Big Query duo of Felipe Hoffa

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.810
and Michael Manoochehri
introduced us to correlation.

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.100
Turning data and assumptions
into actionable information.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.140
From Tel Aviv, Ido Green
delivered a two part series on

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.730
how to build a mobile
application using Google Docs

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:22.570
and Apps Script as
the back end.

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:24.880
And by the way, it's also
a very cool example a

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.230
bidirectional tech support
in an application.

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:30.705
Heading back to Cloudville
Jarek Wilkiewicz and Fred

00:01:30.705 --> 00:01:33.920
Sauer showed us how to get
started with the YouTube API

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.780
using the cloud playground.

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.780
While from Buenos Aires,
[? Nick Bordalati ?]

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.630
discussed Cloud Endpoints.

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.940
From our Tokyo studio, Eiji
Kitamura continued his focus

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.710
on Web Audio, diving into the
midi API for more pure sound

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.910
in your browser.

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:51.835
Here back in Mountain View,
Google Analytics Jim

00:01:51.835 --> 00:01:52.080
[? Contino ?]

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.040
and Andrew Wales went behind the
code to give us an inside

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.590
look at what's new in the
recently released Google

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.120
Analytics version
3 mobile SDK.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.010
When it comes to
[? counting ?]

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:04.680
clicks on any device, real
time is the best time.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.580
Wrapping our studio activity for
the week was Paul Saxman,

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.139
who introduced a brand new
show, "Maps The Mobile

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:11.210
Experience".

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:13.280
This week, Paul explored
techniques for building a

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.680
single handed smartphone
interface for browsing a

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.260
collection of photos on a map.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.280
Oh yes, more cloud.

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.710
We're taking it on the road.

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:24.200
Registration is now open for
the Google Cloud Platform

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.610
developer tour.

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.300
Later this month and next,
we'll be visiting Tokyo,

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.760
London, Berlin, Paris, and Tel
Aviv for in depth talks on App

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.250
Engine, Compute Engine,
and platform services.

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.420
Come see us if you're going
to be in our neighborhood.

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.850
And you've probably heard of
Raspberry Pie, a small

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:41.840
inexpensive device that's
great for learning how

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.310
computing works.

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:44.860
We love Raspberry Pie.

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.270
And now we've build CODER, a
project the turns your pie

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:49.690
into a web server and
development environment.

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.845
Take a look at our project
page and get started with

00:02:51.845 --> 00:02:55.060
CODER, and get all the kids
you know involved too.

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.040
To make sure you never miss a
thing from the world of Google

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.270
