00:00:02.101 --> 00:00:04.637
(Forrest voice-over)
Moments after a viewer asked me
to kill someone,

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:07.073
I was summoned to a meeting
with my producer Grant

00:00:07.106 --> 00:00:09.042
and<i> Review's</i> legal counsel.

00:00:09.075 --> 00:00:12.178 align:start position:0%
There should've been
three vetoes.

00:00:12.211 --> 00:00:13.946 align:end position:100%
(Grant)
Yes.
In retrospect, that is clear.

00:00:13.979 --> 00:00:15.248 align:start position:0%
But alas.

00:00:15.281 --> 00:00:19.819 align:end position:100%
Anyway, I just wanted to make
our position very clear.

00:00:19.852 --> 00:00:22.588 align:end size:72% position:72%
You should not commit
a murder for the show.

00:00:22.621 --> 00:00:23.256 align:start position:0%
Period.

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:27.360 align:start position:0%
I agree with that.

00:00:27.393 --> 00:00:30.830 align:end position:100%
We don't care that it might have
been ground-breaking,

00:00:30.863 --> 00:00:32.765 align:start size:75% position:25%
award-winning television

00:00:32.798 --> 00:00:35.234 align:end position:100%
that people talked about
for years.

00:00:35.267 --> 00:00:36.936 align:start size:66% position:34%
None of that matters.

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:38.638
We're talking about
a human life.

00:00:38.671 --> 00:00:40.139
(Forrest)
That's--yeah. That's right.

00:00:40.172 --> 00:00:41.374 align:start position:0%
It's a human life.

00:00:41.407 --> 00:00:42.108
(Grant)
Even if it means
fading into obscurity,

00:00:42.141 --> 00:00:43.376
there is no one

00:00:43.409 --> 00:00:45.845
whose life is so worthless

00:00:45.878 --> 00:00:46.913
that you should do this.

00:00:46.946 --> 00:00:48.081
Yep.

00:00:48.114 --> 00:00:49.649 align:end position:100%
(Grant)
Even if by not doing it,

00:00:49.682 --> 00:00:51.217 align:end position:100%
eventually people go,
"Oh, yeah,

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:52.685 align:start position:0%
"who was that guy
back in the day, Frosty McNell?

00:00:52.718 --> 00:00:56.989 align:start position:0%
He had a show where he
barfed up pancakes?"

00:00:57.022 --> 00:01:00.993 align:end position:100%
And if you did do this thing,
you would be doing it

00:01:01.026 --> 00:01:04.997 align:end position:100%
knowing that not only were you
not told to by the show,

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.001 align:end position:100%
you were expressly told
not to do it.

00:01:10.236 --> 00:01:12.171 align:start position:0%
(Forrest)
Oh.

00:01:12.204 --> 00:01:14.340
Okay.
Right.

00:01:14.373 --> 00:01:16.342
- Good.
- Yeah, okay.

00:01:16.375 --> 00:01:18.678 align:start position:0%
Yeah.
I got it. I got it.

00:01:18.711 --> 00:01:22.181
So you're telling me

00:01:22.214 --> 00:01:24.016
I should do this.

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:25.084
(both)
No no no no no.

00:01:25.117 --> 00:01:26.385 align:start position:0%
Not at all.
Quite the opposite.

00:01:26.418 --> 00:01:27.720 align:start size:47% position:53%
Absolutely not.

00:01:27.753 --> 00:01:29.122 align:start size:38% position:63%
Don't do it.

00:01:29.155 --> 00:01:30.123
Got it.

00:01:30.156 --> 00:01:32.024
[sighs]

00:01:32.057 --> 00:01:33.192
- Okay, thank you, Forrest.

00:01:33.225 --> 00:01:36.896
Yeah, no, thank you.
Very good.

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:38.364 align:start position:0%
(attorney)
Is he gonna do it?

00:01:40.966 --> 00:01:43.703 align:start position:0%
We have told him
not to do it.

00:01:43.736 --> 00:01:44.736 align:start size:22% position:78%
[sighs]
