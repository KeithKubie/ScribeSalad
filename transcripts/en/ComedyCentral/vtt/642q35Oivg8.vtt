00:00:00.834 --> 00:00:02.535

too you in his heyday?

00:00:03.836 --> 00:00:05.438
No man, I think I have
enough confidence to ...

00:00:05.471 --> 00:00:06.639 line:92%
What's his heyday?

00:00:06.672 --> 00:00:08.375
Yeah. I'll go
with Jeffrey first.

00:00:09.575 --> 00:00:10.843 line:92%
Jeffrey?

00:00:10.876 --> 00:00:12.311
Jeffrey, I'd be like hey
you know what Jeffrey,

00:00:12.344 --> 00:00:14.447
I'm over here for a pool party.
You gonna diddle me?

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.883
I get it. It was the butler
in the pool house.

00:00:16.916 --> 00:00:18.618 line:92%
I'm having fun.

00:00:21.954 --> 00:00:24.290
How did Tatiana Ali
not get it on that set?

00:00:24.323 --> 00:00:25.792 line:92%
Remember when she just ...

00:00:25.825 --> 00:00:27.660
when did she become,
she got hot,

00:00:27.693 --> 00:00:29.896
like adult hot
almost instantaneously.

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:31.264 line:92%
Right before Kev and Kev jumped

00:00:31.297 --> 00:00:33.633
and put her as a love interest
of his short lived sitcom.

00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:34.901 line:92%
Really?

00:00:34.934 --> 00:00:37.003
Yeah, The Big House
I think it was called.

00:00:37.903 --> 00:00:39.405
Yeah, she was a love interest
in it I think.

00:00:39.438 --> 00:00:42.308
Smart. You just go
and get a girl

00:00:42.341 --> 00:00:43.643
he had a crush on
since you were 12.

00:00:43.676 --> 00:00:44.944
You'd be like,
what are you doing,

00:00:44.977 --> 00:00:46.145 line:92%
you want to be in a show.

00:00:46.178 --> 00:00:48.181
And they're like, hi,
you're like yeah, yeah I know.

00:00:48.214 --> 00:00:51.117
What do you call that
genre of black women Chris?

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:54.020
It's the Tatiana Ali,
Chilli from TLC falls in it.

00:00:54.053 --> 00:00:55.354 line:92%
Ooh, yes.

00:00:55.387 --> 00:00:58.725
Like very white people
hair almost.

00:00:59.792 --> 00:01:01.461
It's like very mainstream cute,
I don't know.

00:01:01.494 --> 00:01:03.162 line:92%
Softer features.

00:01:03.195 --> 00:01:04.997
I don't know what they call em.
I like them.

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:06.466 line:92%
I think it's softer features.

00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:08.067
I mean if I'm gonna go
in that zone,

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.037
I'm gonna just slide
into Topanga area.

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.472
I like Lisa,
you know what I mean,

00:01:12.505 --> 00:01:13.739 line:92%
I liked her, Tatiana.

00:01:13.772 --> 00:01:14.974 line:92%
Lisa Turtle?

00:01:15.007 --> 00:01:17.477
I like Lisa Turtle.
They was good but ..

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:18.978
Oh yeah, Lark Voorhies
same thing.

00:01:19.011 --> 00:01:20.179 line:92%
Voorhies was one.

00:01:20.212 --> 00:01:23.282
Is this bad statements?
I was younger at the time

00:01:23.315 --> 00:01:25.017
so I'm gonna say I liked it
when she was younger.

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:26.619 line:92%
Is that a bad thing to say?

00:01:26.652 --> 00:01:28.321 line:92%
Who's that? Which one?

00:01:30.222 --> 00:01:32.091
Tatiana Ali, I like her
when she was like my age.

00:01:32.124 --> 00:01:33.392 line:92%
I'm gonna say at the time.

00:01:33.425 --> 00:01:35.661
Dude, Lark Voorhies became
a bat shit lunatic.

00:01:35.694 --> 00:01:36.896 line:92%
Oh she's crazy.

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:38.131 line:92%
What happened to her?

00:01:38.164 --> 00:01:39.866
I don't know.
She just went nuts.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.635 line:92%
She hacked her face all up.

00:01:42.668 --> 00:01:44.437 line:92%
So she wasn't saved by the bell?

00:01:45.104 --> 00:01:46.973 line:92%
No, the bell dropped the ball.

00:01:47.006 --> 00:01:50.776
All of the sudden they just
started putting pictures of her

00:01:50.809 --> 00:01:52.178 line:92%
looking like a cat faced lady,

00:01:52.211 --> 00:01:53.713
like she had too much
plastic surgery.

00:01:53.746 --> 00:01:54.914 line:92%
She went bonkers.

00:01:54.947 --> 00:01:56.949
Her and Lil Kim smashed
their face into the same wall.

00:01:56.982 --> 00:01:59.719
That is just nuts where people
just keep going back.

00:01:59.752 --> 00:02:00.987 line:92%
You're like stop.

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.156
By the way, 'cause all of them
have a point

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:04.557 line:92%
where you're like perfect.

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:05.825 line:92%
Could we do it?

00:02:05.858 --> 00:02:07.860
But they all have a point
where you can say perfect.

00:02:07.893 --> 00:02:09.629
Michael Jackson
Thriller, perfect.

00:02:09.662 --> 00:02:12.765
Lil Kim ruined her face.
I was a huge Lil Kim fan.

00:02:12.798 --> 00:02:14.033 line:92%
Me too.

00:02:14.066 --> 00:02:15.434
Don't touch it, don't touch it,
fuck,

00:02:15.467 --> 00:02:16.636 line:92%
fuck, fuck, you touched it.

00:02:16.669 --> 00:02:18.037
You touched it too much.
Goddam it.

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:19.272 line:92%
If you go through timelines,

00:02:19.305 --> 00:02:21.574
I'm telling you,
it'll drive you nuts.

00:02:21.607 --> 00:02:25.545
Lil Kim had a point,
Notorious K.I.M., stop there.

00:02:25.578 --> 00:02:29.215
Can someone do, you know like
the black and white video

00:02:29.248 --> 00:02:30.416 line:78%
where the faces were morphing.

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:33.319 line:83%
It's like it's black ...
they could do the Lil Kim faces.

00:02:33.352 --> 00:02:34.754
Oh people have probably
done that already.

00:02:34.787 --> 00:02:35.955 line:92%
Yeah, has to be out there.

00:02:35.988 --> 00:02:38.658
But whenever they do that,
they do it like meth heads too.

00:02:38.691 --> 00:02:41.060
They'll do a really pretty girl
then she does three months

00:02:41.093 --> 00:02:42.862
of meth, six months of meth,
then by like two years-

00:02:42.895 --> 00:02:44.764 line:92%
Then I can fuck her.

00:02:44.797 --> 00:02:46.165 line:92%
Jay's in the picture with her.

00:02:46.198 --> 00:02:49.769
goes man
she has deteriorating quick.

00:02:50.302 --> 00:02:51.504 line:92%
Take the picture man,

00:02:51.537 --> 00:02:53.306
I got to get her back now
while the gettin's good.

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:54.707
I don't know if it's a rebound
or a plummet.

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:56.075 line:92%
This shit's going bad.

00:02:56.108 --> 00:02:59.179
I don't know if I'm rock bottom
or on her way back to the top.

00:02:59.945 --> 00:03:01.781
Let's just hope
it's a bounce back.

00:03:04.083 --> 00:03:07.153
Oh shit.
Nothing on Alfonzo Riviera?

00:03:07.186 --> 00:03:09.322
No, I found something,
he's suing

00:03:09.355 --> 00:03:11.290
Fortnite for using
the Carlton dance.

00:03:11.323 --> 00:03:14.160
I saw that.
Maybe that's what it was.

00:03:14.193 --> 00:03:16.195 line:92%
Hell yeah. Good for him.

00:03:16.228 --> 00:03:17.730
Maybe he was me too'd by
Fortnite.

00:03:17.763 --> 00:03:20.866
I'd like to know
that Carlton's litigious.

00:03:20.899 --> 00:03:23.903
There's this video saying ...
it's a TMZ video

00:03:23.936 --> 00:03:26.205
that says sad Michael Jackson
didn't touch him.

00:03:26.238 --> 00:03:27.573
Get out of here.
Well of course.

00:03:27.606 --> 00:03:29.342
Then there was a guy-
It's an ATM card.

00:03:29.375 --> 00:03:31.510
With the same last name
that's actually a hockey player

00:03:31.543 --> 00:03:34.681
from Canada that was accused
of assaulting the nanny.

00:03:35.447 --> 00:03:36.983 line:92%
Oh, that wasn't my thought.

00:03:37.016 --> 00:03:39.252
You blended your hockey news
and your Carlton news.

00:03:39.285 --> 00:03:42.221
Oh, my Carlton and hockey news,
I do read those back to back.

00:03:42.254 --> 00:03:43.789
Yeah, you got to get
different apps for em.

00:03:43.822 --> 00:03:45.491
Or you should not have
any Carlton news ever.

00:03:45.524 --> 00:03:46.792
I do every day
go to Fresh Prince

00:03:46.825 --> 00:03:48.794
where are they now's
and then the Daily Puck.

00:03:48.827 --> 00:03:50.062 line:92%
Where is Jeffrey at?

00:03:50.095 --> 00:03:52.265
I go up and I read
the Saskatoon Gazette.

00:03:52.298 --> 00:03:53.499 line:92%
What's that?

00:03:53.532 --> 00:03:54.700 line:92%
Why is Jeffrey not killing it.

00:03:54.733 --> 00:03:55.901
Jeffrey is killing it.
He's just spending his money.

00:03:55.934 --> 00:03:57.136
He was already
an older guy.

00:03:57.169 --> 00:03:58.337
You know what he's doing
right now?

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:00.640
Right now he's got
some reasonable sunglasses on.

00:04:00.673 --> 00:04:01.907 line:92%
He's in swimsuits-

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:03.743 line:92%
A hot 40 year old.

00:04:03.776 --> 00:04:05.544
Oh dude yeah, he's got a hot
40 year old

00:04:05.577 --> 00:04:06.779 line:92%
and he's just on a-

00:04:06.812 --> 00:04:08.214 line:92%
Good body, all ass.

00:04:08.247 --> 00:04:09.548 line:92%
Yeah, he's just on the patio.

00:04:09.581 --> 00:04:11.317
Fat ass. I'm imagining this
and I like it for Jeffrey.

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:12.618 line:92%
I'm feeling good for Jeffrey.

00:04:12.651 --> 00:04:13.819 line:92%
Of course.

00:04:13.852 --> 00:04:15.388
He just gets noticed
occasionally at dinner.

00:04:15.421 --> 00:04:16.922 line:92%
Oh thank you, thank you.

00:04:16.955 --> 00:04:18.658 line:92%
Yes, yes, that was fun.

00:04:19.725 --> 00:04:21.060 line:92%
I talk to Will occasionally.

00:04:21.093 --> 00:04:23.162
Oh yes, Master William would
have loved that, okay, okay.

00:04:23.195 --> 00:04:24.530 line:92%
All right good seeing you.

00:04:24.563 --> 00:04:26.098 line:92%
Okay, enjoy your meal.

00:04:26.131 --> 00:04:29.468
Cheers. Yeah, he's
just living the life.

00:04:29.501 --> 00:04:31.737
Alfonso? God only knows.
Jay thinks he's ...

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.439
He's all over the game
show network.

00:04:33.472 --> 00:04:34.640
I know.
Oh they love him.

00:04:34.673 --> 00:04:37.643
Him and Mario Lopez are just
getting younger by the day.

00:04:37.676 --> 00:04:38.911 line:92%
That was smart.

00:04:38.944 --> 00:04:40.980
It's a smart move
on both of their parts.

00:04:41.814 --> 00:04:46.219
Mario Lopez was like put me on
every TV in every hotel, Extra.

00:04:46.852 --> 00:04:49.121
I tell you what, I almost forget
that he's A.C.

00:04:49.154 --> 00:04:50.523
Slayter now
I think of him now more

00:04:50.556 --> 00:04:53.993 line:76%
as the junk advertisement
television face.

00:04:54.026 --> 00:04:56.696
He looks worse when he was A.C.
Slayter than he does now.

00:04:56.729 --> 00:04:58.597
He looks amazing.
It pisses me off.

00:04:58.630 --> 00:04:59.832 line:92%
Yeah, he held up great.

00:04:59.865 --> 00:05:01.267
For some reason he's like one
of those people

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:02.501 line:92%
who I kinda hate him.

00:05:02.534 --> 00:05:04.771
I bet he could take
Valley now.

00:05:05.304 --> 00:05:06.539 line:92%
Absolutely.

00:05:06.572 --> 00:05:07.740 line:92%
A wrestling match.

00:05:07.773 --> 00:05:09.375
For sure.
I'd put my money on A.C.

00:05:09.408 --> 00:05:10.910 line:92%
Good looks, bad casting on ...

00:05:10.943 --> 00:05:13.713
have you seen the reveal
of Jigsaw on Punisher yet?

00:05:13.746 --> 00:05:14.947 line:92%
No I have not.

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:16.215 line:92%
When they reveal it?

00:05:16.248 --> 00:05:19.352
Well let me tell you the bummer
of this, it's a waste of time.

00:05:19.385 --> 00:05:21.120
Why they make it
a big reveal ...

00:05:21.153 --> 00:05:24.090
he's got a few nicks
on his gorgeous face.

00:05:24.123 --> 00:05:26.826
This guy can get more pussy
than all of us in this room.

00:05:26.859 --> 00:05:28.060 line:92%
He's got Rambo face.

00:05:28.093 --> 00:05:30.963
If he had double the amount
of scars he has.

00:05:30.996 --> 00:05:34.266
Didn't they do Jigsaw in one of
the incarnations of Punisher

00:05:34.299 --> 00:05:36.335
and he was like
all super fucking cut up?

00:05:36.368 --> 00:05:38.971
He's supposed to be a face
like a jigsaw puzzle.

00:05:39.004 --> 00:05:40.539
It's not Jigsaw-ly at all,
it's ...

00:05:40.572 --> 00:05:42.842
You know what, go ahead and blow
it for me, you can spoil it.

00:05:42.875 --> 00:05:44.343
It looks like he got attacked
with a tiger lady.

00:05:44.376 --> 00:05:45.578 line:92%
Not even.

00:05:45.611 --> 00:05:47.947
'Cause what you said he goes,
oh I gashed my cheek.

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:52.084
Yeah, his face was smashed
into a mirror to oblivion.

00:05:52.117 --> 00:05:53.652
If we could look up
all the Jigsaws

00:05:53.685 --> 00:05:55.454
'cause I know there's one there
where they did it fucked up

00:05:55.487 --> 00:05:57.656
and I think it was
the one with Thomas Jane?

00:05:57.689 --> 00:05:58.958 line:92%
Yeah dude this was terrible.

00:05:58.991 --> 00:06:00.192 line:92%
Or the one after that?

00:06:00.225 --> 00:06:02.295 line:92%
I mean Punisher's great, so far.

00:06:02.795 --> 00:06:04.063
I love the character
and the guy-

00:06:04.096 --> 00:06:05.965 line:92%
Yeah, I watched the whole thing.

00:06:05.998 --> 00:06:08.134
I'm on episode five-
Look at that.

00:06:08.167 --> 00:06:09.702
Yes, that's what
it's supposed to be.

00:06:09.735 --> 00:06:11.470
You're supposed to throw up
a little bit in your mouth

00:06:11.503 --> 00:06:12.838
when you look at it.
You're supposed to see him,

00:06:12.871 --> 00:06:14.039
that's what I thought
they were coming with.

00:06:14.072 --> 00:06:15.508
I'm gonna be honest,
this guy is still sexy.

00:06:15.541 --> 00:06:16.776
I ain't gonna lie,
he's still sexy.

00:06:16.809 --> 00:06:18.778
Please bring it up.
Sexy scars.

00:06:18.811 --> 00:06:21.080
Yeah, everyone's
an interesting story

00:06:21.113 --> 00:06:22.581
about something masculine
he's done.

00:06:22.614 --> 00:06:24.850
Yeah dude, honestly
I didn't even think ...

00:06:24.883 --> 00:06:26.085 line:92%
I don't know.

00:06:26.118 --> 00:06:27.386 line:92%
Can you bring it up?

00:06:27.419 --> 00:06:29.221
Yeah, I'm trying to find one
that shows it straight on.

00:06:29.254 --> 00:06:30.423 line:92%
Just do reveal.

00:06:30.456 --> 00:06:31.657 line:92%
If you can even see it.

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:33.459 line:92%
Just do Jigsaw reveal Punisher.

00:06:33.492 --> 00:06:34.894
See that's what it should
look like.

00:06:34.927 --> 00:06:36.529
It should look like all cut up,
Frankenstein.

00:06:36.562 --> 00:06:39.865
Also the thing is why
he's so furious too,

00:06:39.898 --> 00:06:42.268
one of the things
he's very narcissistic.

00:06:42.301 --> 00:06:45.337
And it was that he was a good
looking guy who's now hideous.

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:47.273
And now they've made him
a good looking guy

00:06:47.306 --> 00:06:50.342 line:76%
who looks exactly the same
with some battle scars.

00:06:50.375 --> 00:06:51.610 line:92%
That's what he looks like.

00:06:51.643 --> 00:06:52.878 line:92%
What?

00:06:52.911 --> 00:06:55.714
Get him way close if you want.
It doesn't make any difference.

00:06:55.747 --> 00:06:58.050
He's still like head
turning-ly sexy.

00:06:58.083 --> 00:07:00.052 line:92%
Dude that's hot.

00:07:00.085 --> 00:07:02.388
He looks like he didn't
break a mirror.

00:07:03.522 --> 00:07:05.758
If I were Punisher and he showed
up like that I'd be like

00:07:05.791 --> 00:07:07.059 line:92%
I didn't do my job well.

00:07:07.092 --> 00:07:10.463
What are you mad about?
I say you paid a minimum price.

00:07:10.496 --> 00:07:13.199
You won't have to buy a beer.
You have to tell one story

00:07:13.232 --> 00:07:14.900
and you'll never have to
buy a beer again.

00:07:14.933 --> 00:07:17.503
You're mad at me?
You hot ...

00:07:18.604 --> 00:07:20.139
The girls who didn't want
to fuck you,

00:07:20.172 --> 00:07:22.508
they thought you were cocky,
now think you're vulnerable.

00:07:22.541 --> 00:07:25.845
He's like why did you make me,
make you more fuckable?

00:07:26.912 --> 00:07:28.647
Punisher, that's what makes
Punisher angrier.

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:30.382 line:92%
No!

00:07:30.415 --> 00:07:32.485
You're eating the pussy
all over town.

00:07:32.518 --> 00:07:36.121
I told then you knew my family
and now he's more fuckable.

00:07:36.154 --> 00:07:39.158
He murdered my family.
He fucked the FBI chick.

00:07:40.726 --> 00:07:41.994 line:92%
It's Lewis as Punisher?

00:07:42.027 --> 00:07:43.395
Yeah, I don't know,
I don't do anything else.

00:07:43.428 --> 00:07:45.131
He's not a real ass dude
anymore.

00:07:45.931 --> 00:07:47.633
Yeah dude
I'm really disappointed.

00:07:47.666 --> 00:07:49.468
That should be,
if you could screen grab that,

00:07:49.501 --> 00:07:50.870
the one on the left
should easily be ...

00:07:50.903 --> 00:07:52.571 line:92%
It's crazy disappointing.

00:07:52.604 --> 00:07:54.707
But you know what,
it does follow suit.

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:56.175
Yesterday Chris
we were talking about

00:07:56.208 --> 00:08:00.412
how Marvel makes all their main
characters shave their chest.

00:08:00.445 --> 00:08:01.714 line:92%
In all Marvel movies.

00:08:01.747 --> 00:08:03.716
If you notice in Punisher,
I noticed in Punisher

00:08:03.749 --> 00:08:05.317 line:92%
and we all ended up agreeing,

00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:08.587
we noticed that you could see
he's stubbly all over his body

00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:10.289
because he shaves
his body hair.

00:08:10.322 --> 00:08:13.158
Two things, first of all you're
focusing on the wrong thing.

00:08:13.191 --> 00:08:14.426 line:92%
There's a story line.

00:08:14.459 --> 00:08:16.061 line:92%
It was a sex scene.

00:08:16.094 --> 00:08:17.763
Oh I mean I'm not looking
at his chest.

00:08:17.796 --> 00:08:19.331
Are you like old school
homophobic

00:08:19.364 --> 00:08:21.166
where the second there's
a man's body on you're all ...

00:08:21.199 --> 00:08:22.434 line:92%
Oh hell no.

00:08:22.467 --> 00:08:23.669 line:92%
I'm looking to the sky.

00:08:23.702 --> 00:08:25.137 line:92%
Dicks in the room.

00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:30.709
I'm a grown ass man,
I'll change my own damn wound.

00:08:30.742 --> 00:08:32.011 line:92%
No!

00:08:32.044 --> 00:08:34.880
Mother fucker walking
around dick all willy nilly.

00:08:34.913 --> 00:08:37.716
Sensual ass mother fucker
sneaking up on me.

00:08:37.749 --> 00:08:39.585 line:92%
Pretty ass mother fucker.

00:08:39.618 --> 00:08:41.521 line:92%
Story line taking it all sexual.

00:08:43.121 --> 00:08:45.458
I ain't looking at Punisher's
chest hairs.

00:08:46.858 --> 00:08:48.260
There's a bitch
over his shoulder.

00:08:48.293 --> 00:08:49.795
I ain't gonna lie, I was looking
at the bitch

00:08:49.828 --> 00:08:51.297
over the shoulder
the whole time.

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:52.698
I never even noticed
his chest hair.

00:08:52.731 --> 00:08:55.301
She does a kiss up his belly
and you just notice

00:08:55.334 --> 00:08:58.904
that his whole body
is not even recently shaved.

00:08:58.937 --> 00:09:00.439
It's just stubbly,
it's that stubbly?

00:09:00.472 --> 00:09:02.141
Yeah. It comes in stubbly.
Can you bring it up?

00:09:02.174 --> 00:09:03.409 line:92%
Yeah, bring that up.

00:09:03.442 --> 00:09:04.610 line:92%
Bring up the sex scene.

00:09:04.643 --> 00:09:06.211
Look who wants to see
the parts of kissable stomach.

00:09:06.244 --> 00:09:07.813
I'm not looking
at a man's stubble.

00:09:07.846 --> 00:09:09.281
I just didn't notice
the stubble.

00:09:09.314 --> 00:09:10.616
I get it, you just need
to be led there.

00:09:10.649 --> 00:09:12.284 line:92%
Christine, here's when I know me

00:09:12.317 --> 00:09:16.355
and you are not fully connected
yet on our wavelengths.

00:09:16.388 --> 00:09:18.357
Right there when he goes
I'll look at it, I'll see it.

00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:21.493
If you should just put up
a video of a guy's huge honker

00:09:21.526 --> 00:09:22.761 line:92%
flopping around,

00:09:22.794 --> 00:09:24.463
would've been the funniest
thing to see Chris ...

00:09:24.496 --> 00:09:26.299
and then eventually go,
oh hell no.

00:09:26.965 --> 00:09:39.712
I'm a grown ass man
I'll wait in the lobby.
