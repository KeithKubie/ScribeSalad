hello is de nada and Finn Kennedy from
 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:04.820
hello is de nada and Finn Kennedy from
Sussex in England and my question where

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:04.830
Sussex in England and my question where
 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.579
Sussex in England and my question where
the james webb space telescope is to

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589
the james webb space telescope is to
 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:10.009
the james webb space telescope is to
what extent do you hope that will

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019
what extent do you hope that will
 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.039
what extent do you hope that will
improve the quality of information

00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:12.049
improve the quality of information
 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:14.900
improve the quality of information
regarding the search for extra solar

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910
regarding the search for extra solar
 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.990
regarding the search for extra solar
system planets and what might that tell

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000
system planets and what might that tell
 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.950
system planets and what might that tell
us from what i understand the telescope

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960
us from what i understand the telescope
 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.650
us from what i understand the telescope
is it truly astonishing feat of

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660
is it truly astonishing feat of
 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.029
is it truly astonishing feat of
engineering well done indeed thank you

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039
engineering well done indeed thank you
 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.370
engineering well done indeed thank you
so mr. Kennedy wants to know about the

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380
so mr. Kennedy wants to know about the
 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.110
so mr. Kennedy wants to know about the
James Webb Space Telescope and what it

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120
James Webb Space Telescope and what it
 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.549
James Webb Space Telescope and what it
will tell us about planets around other

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559
will tell us about planets around other
 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.060
will tell us about planets around other
stars so James Webb telescope is a good

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070
stars so James Webb telescope is a good
 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.830
stars so James Webb telescope is a good
tool for following up on discoveries

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840
tool for following up on discoveries
 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.260
tool for following up on discoveries
that are made with other tools and it's

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270
that are made with other tools and it's
 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.069
that are made with other tools and it's
also very good for taking pictures of

00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:45.079
also very good for taking pictures of
 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:48.350
also very good for taking pictures of
planets that might be there we already

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360
planets that might be there we already
 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.340
planets that might be there we already
know from the Hubble Space Telescope

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350
know from the Hubble Space Telescope
 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.439
know from the Hubble Space Telescope
that a good telescope in space can

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449
that a good telescope in space can
 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.270
that a good telescope in space can
actually take a picture that'll show a

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280
actually take a picture that'll show a
 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.209
actually take a picture that'll show a
planet so it'll only work for a bright

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219
planet so it'll only work for a bright
 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.979
planet so it'll only work for a bright
planet that's pretty far from its star

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989
planet that's pretty far from its star
 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.500
planet that's pretty far from its star
so jupiter-like planets are good

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510
so jupiter-like planets are good
 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.029
so jupiter-like planets are good
candidates especially if they're young

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039
candidates especially if they're young
 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.210
candidates especially if they're young
and hot the other tool that we have is

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220
and hot the other tool that we have is
 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.670
and hot the other tool that we have is
what's called transit spectroscopy once

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680
what's called transit spectroscopy once
 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.740
what's called transit spectroscopy once
in a while a planet will go between its

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750
in a while a planet will go between its
 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.780
in a while a planet will go between its
star and our telescope and it will block

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790
star and our telescope and it will block
 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.910
star and our telescope and it will block
some of the Starlight and some of that

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920
some of the Starlight and some of that
 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.410
some of the Starlight and some of that
starlight will actually go through the

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420
starlight will actually go through the
 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.749
starlight will actually go through the
atmosphere of that planet so we can tell

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759
atmosphere of that planet so we can tell
 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.609
atmosphere of that planet so we can tell
something about the characteristics of

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619
something about the characteristics of
 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.920
something about the characteristics of
that planet from what we see when this

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930
that planet from what we see when this
 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.320
that planet from what we see when this
happens so we will have a catalog of

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330
happens so we will have a catalog of
 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.230
happens so we will have a catalog of
stars where we know when the these

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240
stars where we know when the these
 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.850
stars where we know when the these
transits are going to occur we can turn

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860
transits are going to occur we can turn
 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.499
transits are going to occur we can turn
our telescope in that direction and take

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509
our telescope in that direction and take
 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.690
our telescope in that direction and take
the data and see something about the

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700
the data and see something about the
 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.490
the data and see something about the
chemistry of those planets it will be

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500
chemistry of those planets it will be
 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.310
chemistry of those planets it will be
very exciting time
