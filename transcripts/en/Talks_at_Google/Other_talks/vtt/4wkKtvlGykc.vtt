00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:06.610
CLIFF REDEKER: How's
everybody doing today?

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:09.615
Good morning and welcome
to another exciting Talks

00:00:09.615 --> 00:00:11.150
at Google event.

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:14.590
I'm Cliff, but the real
star of our conversation

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:18.333
here today is Ekta Kapoor, so
please welcome her to Google.

00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:18.832
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:18.832 --> 00:00:19.790
EKTA KAPOOR: Thank you.

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:20.616
Thank you.

00:00:20.616 --> 00:00:22.840
CLIFF REDEKER: Now
she can clearly

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.370
be described as India's
number one media mogul.

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:30.720
She has production experience--
over 15,000 hours of content,

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.120
and that number is
growing on a daily basis,

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.400
as we'll talk about during
our conversation today.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.410
She's constantly changing
the face of media in India.

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.610
Under her leadership,
Balaji Telefilms

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.430
has expanded to include the
Balaji Motion Pictures, ALT

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.460
Entertainment Limited,
Bolt Media Limited,

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.470
and the popularity
continues to grow.

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.490
She's topped ratings
on TV for decades,

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:58.100
especially with soap operas
and serials such as the "Kyunki

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.640
Saas Bhi Kabi Bahu Thi."

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.030
[LAUGHING]

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.920
I had to-- I had to
practice my Hindi

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.650
before I brought in this Talk.

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.620
And also we have the
"Kahaani Ghar Ghar Kii,"

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:10.570
the "Hum Paanch"--

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:11.860
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.487
Sorry, I-- it's getting better.

00:01:13.487 --> 00:01:15.320
EKTA KAPOOR: They sound
way better with you.

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.740
Please continue.

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:16.180
CLIFF REDEKER: Thank you.

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:16.967
Thank you.

00:01:16.967 --> 00:01:19.650
And then several
blockbuster films, including

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.780
the "Shootout at Lokhandwada."

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:23.680
EKTA KAPOOR: Wala.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:24.910
CLIFF REDEKER: Wala.

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:26.010
So close.

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:28.340
"Ragini MMS" and then
"The Dirty Picture."

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:29.590
I'm able to get that one done.

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.680
[LAUGHING]

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.550
And we'll have time for some
brief Q&amp;A towards the end,

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:36.220
so be on the lookout
for a microphone

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.080
as it circulates around.

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.760
But I just wanted to start out
by you're here in the Bay Area.

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.370
What brings you to town?

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:45.670
What have you been
up to recently?

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.190
EKTA KAPOOR: So actually--
two different questions,

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:50.000
but I'll answer both.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.950
We were about to
organize a BCL cricket

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.280
match, a totally different
experience for anyone who

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.970
watches television with TV
stars playing out cricket

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:03.399
with women and men playing TV.

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:04.440
It's an interesting form.

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.650
I just added
[INAUDIBLE] this year.

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:08.880
What a fabulous response.

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:09.750
Great ratings.

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.220
So we decided-- it's an
event based TV gameshow,

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.290
so I can do it off
television in a studio

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:23.020
so the game can be watched live
or then watched on television.

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:24.400
So we're planning
to do it again,

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.615
because we had some visa
issues and we couldn't do it.

00:02:27.615 --> 00:02:29.380
But I said, let's
not cancel the trip,

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.710
and come and reassure
our viewers here

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.060
that we're going to do it soon.

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.625
CLIFF REDEKER: And so
has that been a challenge

00:02:36.625 --> 00:02:38.830
or a difference for
you, moving away

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:43.240
from the more drama
and fiction-based shows

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.170
to this sporting event?

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.530
EKTA KAPOOR: So I'm
as far from sports

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.540
as probably Sachin
Tendulkar is from dramas,

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.590
but I had no option.

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.460
But when this concept came
to me with all the television

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:59.770
stars with women and
men playing cricket,

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:03.610
especially with the growing
interest in women for cricket,

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:04.800
I was like, why not do it.

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.530
Because it's not the love of the
game, but the love of equality

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.120
that made me enjoy
the whole game.

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.490
Women are playing it as well.

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:14.370
I love it when a
female television

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:15.670
actress gets a guy out.

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.982
There's so much
sledging out there.

00:03:17.982 --> 00:03:19.440
So if you see the
game live, you'll

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.269
actually be shocked because
people forget that known TV

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:24.310
stars, they start sledging
each other, especially

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:25.770
the male actors.

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:29.190
And at the end, you're all
rooting for the women for them

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:30.080
to get the guys out.

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.100
So it's interesting, fun.

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.692
It's exciting.

00:03:32.692 --> 00:03:35.150
It's a whole new concept, and
I thought enjoyed cricket way

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:36.710
more when I saw it this way.

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:38.126
CLIFF REDEKER:
Well, hopefully you

00:03:38.126 --> 00:03:39.650
can bowl a few rounds yourself.

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.140
EKTA KAPOOR: As
far as-- I managed

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.590
to hit the bat when
Sunny Deol bowled,

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.920
and I think I did
a pretty good job,

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.590
but that's because I have some
experience of playing squash.

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:53.624
But as far as dramas go,
I continue doing drama.

00:03:53.624 --> 00:03:55.040
Actually, that's
the thing I know,

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.080
and I probably only
know two things in life.

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.060
One is probably making
tea, [INAUDIBLE] green tea,

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.150
and the second is dramas,
so I can't leave it.

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.500
CLIFF REDEKER: Well, the
success continues to follow.

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.600
And I was hoping for the
folks in the audience

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.480
and the folks on YouTube
if you could give me

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.811
a little bit of background to
the origins of your production

00:04:14.811 --> 00:04:15.310
company.

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.261
It sounds like many
great things, like Google

00:04:18.261 --> 00:04:19.760
and up and down the
street here, you

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.700
started in a garage, which
I thought was pretty cool.

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:22.410
EKTA KAPOOR: Yes.

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:30.900
So the year I was about 16 years
old and extremely overweight.

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:32.840
No interest, unlike
many other star kids,

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.909
to join films as an actress.

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:37.200
Not that anyone would take
me with that kind of weight,

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.180
but I didn't have any
interest myself also.

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:43.270
And all I wanted to do was tell
stories or become a journalist

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:45.140
or do something interesting.

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:47.870
Television was in its
nascent stage at that time,

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:51.310
and my dad offered me to
make television programming

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:55.010
for a friend of his who
had a channel in the UK

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:57.462
called TV Asia.

00:04:57.462 --> 00:04:58.780
So I sat down.

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:00.890
I started making the
programs, and the channel

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:02.050
got sold to Zee.

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:05.320
So I had three shows
and no channel.

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:08.410
So I said, let's try to sell it
here, and none of it got sold.

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:11.340
Made some more shows, and
after about four years

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:14.250
of struggle, real
struggle, I [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:17.550
hitting it with one of the
channels, Zee in India,

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:19.270
with "Hum Paanch."

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:23.090
And then four or five years
of more struggle, and I

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:25.310
ended up doing a show
called "Kyo Kii,"

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:27.077
and then I just took off.

00:05:27.077 --> 00:05:28.660
I think that's that
Eureka moment that

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:29.910
happens when you say, OK.

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:31.130
OK, now it's happening.

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:31.630
Oh, wow.

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:33.010
It's happening.

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:35.027
CLIFF REDEKER: It's real life.

00:05:35.027 --> 00:05:36.610
And the other thing
that surprised me,

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:39.690
too-- it's a family
business, but in contrast

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:42.440
to many family
businesses in India,

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:44.017
it's a mother-daughter deal.

00:05:44.017 --> 00:05:45.600
So how did that come
about, and what's

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:48.560
it like working
with your mom who

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:50.490
herself as a storied career?

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:54.310
EKTA KAPOOR: So my mom was
a housewife, ran a shop.

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:56.440
Completely star wife.

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.030
I was 16.

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:01.870
My dad was probably one of
the most emancipated fathers.

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:03.440
He was like, you must work.

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:05.660
You must do something
with your own life.

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:07.950
And he gave us a
little bit of capital

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:10.030
and said, do something now.

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:15.370
My mom, who had no idea about
business, got him to help me.

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:18.560
And both of us started, and
we made a business out of it.

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:21.760
I think it's important
for parents-- I mean,

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:24.190
we don't even realize how
smart our mothers are when they

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:26.080
manage the budget of the house.

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:27.910
I think that knowledge
helped her manage.

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:30.320
Today, she's known as one of
the best women in production

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:31.280
in India.

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:34.990
But it's as simple
or as complicated

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:37.500
as managing a budget
of a house, she says.

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:41.420
She says that gave her the
ground knowledge of how

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:46.580
to run a business, and it
was probably-- even today,

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:49.860
she takes extremely
strong and keen interest

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:53.162
in the house budget, because
she says it refines her skills.

00:06:53.162 --> 00:06:53.995
CLIFF REDEKER: Yeah.

00:06:53.995 --> 00:06:56.050
Yeah, and if the
house is not in order,

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:59.030
then it's hard to
keep the empire going.

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:00.780
And of course,
Tusshar, your brother,

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:03.910
also successful
in his own right.

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:06.570
Was there sibling
rivalry growing up

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:09.469
when you have two
sibling in the industry?

00:07:09.469 --> 00:07:11.760
EKTA KAPOOR: He's an actor
and I'm actually a producer,

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:13.770
so there was really no rivalry.

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:16.920
But he's a simpler person.

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:19.200
He's not too ambitious.

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:20.482
He is now a father.

00:07:20.482 --> 00:07:21.690
CLIFF REDEKER: Yeah, I heard.

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:22.750
EKTA KAPOOR: Yeah.

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:28.110
And he's given us the biggest
joy of our life, my nephew.

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:32.680
And I think I've
never had-- I mean,

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:35.660
not many people know this, but
I've been in awe of my brother.

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:39.481
I actually think he's a smarter,
saner, more stable person

00:07:39.481 --> 00:07:39.980
than me.

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:41.570
I'm all over the
place, you know.

00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:44.580
I could be good in one
thing-- that is business--

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:48.981
but I don't have the kind
of balance he has in life.

00:07:48.981 --> 00:07:50.480
CLIFF REDEKER: But
at the same time,

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:53.977
it's a very family-- like
your family's very close-knit.

00:07:53.977 --> 00:07:55.810
You know, you were
telling me before, you're

00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:58.290
taking care of your nephew,
like, everybody's getting

00:07:58.290 --> 00:08:01.670
together for home-cooked meals.

00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:03.420
How do you keep that
sense of family while

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:07.602
at the same time dealing with
the ever-growing business?

00:08:07.602 --> 00:08:09.810
Are you always talking about
the business, or about--

00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:11.390
EKTA KAPOOR: So I don't
think being close-knit

00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:13.700
as a family means spending
family time, too much of it,

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:14.600
you know?

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:17.060
Once or twice a week, we have
lunch or dinner together.

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:20.140
Most of the time, we're
working, but we're always

00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:21.500
connected to each other.

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:23.000
And of course, we
all have duties

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.216
as far as my nephew goes.

00:08:26.216 --> 00:08:27.934
And we all take it
up so you can do

00:08:27.934 --> 00:08:29.600
what you want in your
business, but when

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:32.416
it's your time to take
care of your nephew,

00:08:32.416 --> 00:08:34.450
it's that that takes over.

00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:37.679
So there's like clearly--
I mean, everything else

00:08:37.679 --> 00:08:38.890
takes a backstage.

00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:44.990
But more than
anything else, I think

00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:47.300
my family was the reason
I got into business.

00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:49.570
I mean, they gave
me a lot of support.

00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:51.210
I'm too lazy to move out.

00:08:51.210 --> 00:08:52.170
I can't live alone.

00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:54.020
It's not my scene.

00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:56.800
I mean, having a house with--

00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:57.675
CLIFF REDEKER: Right.

00:08:57.675 --> 00:08:58.440
Right.

00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:01.360
EKTA KAPOOR: --home-cooked
meals-- I'm not giving it up.

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:03.906
I can't go home and now
check-- like while my mother is

00:09:03.906 --> 00:09:05.530
damn good at checking
the house budget,

00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:09.032
I'd be a disaster at it.

00:09:09.032 --> 00:09:11.490
I'm, like, probably the only
person who lives in the house.

00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:13.950
Like, mom's says you're
living in a hotel.

00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:15.930
You don't know anything
that's happening.

00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:18.650
So I'm like one of those people
who waltzes in two o'clock

00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:23.520
after work, get fresh food, be
happy about it, and pass out.

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:26.145
So I will never live alone.

00:09:26.145 --> 00:09:27.270
CLIFF REDEKER: That's cool.

00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:29.770
And then I'm also curious
to learn a little bit more

00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:33.380
about your production
cycle for serials in India.

00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:35.200
I'm a little--
admittedly a little bit

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:37.561
more familiar with how
they work in America,

00:09:37.561 --> 00:09:39.810
but it seems like the volume
is just that much higher.

00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:40.220
So--

00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:40.630
EKTA KAPOOR: Yeah.

00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:42.600
CLIFF REDEKER: --how do you
keep track of all the episodes?

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:44.933
EKTA KAPOOR: So it's constantly
checking on the episodes

00:09:44.933 --> 00:09:45.970
here and there.

00:09:45.970 --> 00:09:48.272
I go through the story
lines constantly.

00:09:48.272 --> 00:09:50.230
There are many of us
which are doing very well.

00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:54.530
There's one called "Kasam,"
"Ye Hai Mohabbatein,"

00:09:54.530 --> 00:09:58.545
and, of course, "Naagin," which
created a whole new era as

00:09:58.545 --> 00:09:59.520
far as ratings go.

00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:02.150
What I'm doing now is
because the global Indian,

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:05.200
the city Indian, is very
different from the mass Indian.

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:07.450
And while we're making
television for the mass Indian,

00:10:07.450 --> 00:10:10.130
for the global Indian
and for the urban Indian,

00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:12.212
we're creating this app
which is going to start

00:10:12.212 --> 00:10:13.170
at the end of the year.

00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:15.870
[INAUDIBLE] this side of
the town, of the country,

00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:19.370
of-- in Frisco
last December, when

00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:22.910
it was really cold in Frisco
which is quite shocking.

00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:26.170
And I had come to raise
funds, which I got.

00:10:26.170 --> 00:10:31.060
And I'm now about
to start my app

00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:35.460
in November, which is going to
be high-impact, shorter series.

00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:38.430
13 to 20 episodes at max.

00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:43.610
Multilingual, so
Tamil, Punjabi--

00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:47.320
all different
languages, plus Hindi.

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:49.000
Hinglish also.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.139
And it's going to create
content for the urban Indian who

00:10:52.139 --> 00:10:53.680
doesn't have that
much time but wants

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:56.520
to watch high-impact,
good quality content,

00:10:56.520 --> 00:11:00.160
like a longer elongated
film, but 13 episodes instead

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:02.280
of watching a daily
soap every day.

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:05.480
More individual viewing,
more urban in its taste,

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:08.020
more with urban issues
coming into place.

00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:08.961
No multitasking.

00:11:08.961 --> 00:11:10.210
Stuff that we don't deal with.

00:11:10.210 --> 00:11:12.350
Because while
television has become

00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:17.530
one size fits all, which is for
the extremely smaller towns who

00:11:17.530 --> 00:11:20.450
like stories which are very,
very basic because they're

00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:24.160
very, very simple in their
days, the urban, slightly more

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:27.760
complicated, slightly
more emancipated Indian

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:30.840
will now get content for
them in their language

00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:33.109
with their thought
processes on the app.

00:11:33.109 --> 00:11:35.400
CLIFF REDEKER: And that's
something that's really true.

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:37.730
I mean, with the
success of your serials,

00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:39.240
it's a cultural phenomenon.

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:42.980
People throughout the country
are-- they know them by name.

00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:48.090
To what extent are you shaping
culture versus reflecting

00:11:48.090 --> 00:11:49.527
the culture that you see?

00:11:49.527 --> 00:11:51.568
EKTA KAPOOR: I don't know
if I"m shaping culture.

00:11:51.568 --> 00:11:54.940
I've had a lot of men tell
me that we don't get food

00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:59.720
when your shows air, which
means I'm quite happy.

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:03.550
I say then go and
get your own plate.

00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:06.670
Let her watch.

00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:11.350
But yes, I actually believe
I-- I'm an observer.

00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:12.360
I love human beings.

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:13.990
I love people.

00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:18.050
I think while myself I'm very
private, I like to see people,

00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:19.570
notice how they live.

00:12:19.570 --> 00:12:20.970
I notice small, small things.

00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:23.090
How people are at home.

00:12:23.090 --> 00:12:25.999
I never lived in a joint
family, but I made all my shows

00:12:25.999 --> 00:12:26.790
about joint family.

00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:28.550
It was a labor of
aspiration, of how

00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:31.730
life would be if I was in
a full or joint family.

00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:35.080
It was also a little bit
of noticing friends' homes.

00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:38.670
And then, of course,
it was about the fact

00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:40.960
that a lot of women
in India are told

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:44.730
to take over their place
of their mother-in-law.

00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:47.890
And it's easy to give
everything to your son,

00:12:47.890 --> 00:12:50.930
because if I'm a man,
I give to my son.

00:12:50.930 --> 00:12:53.650
But a woman is told to give
to a new girl who comes

00:12:53.650 --> 00:12:55.669
to the house, and
we call it-- like,

00:12:55.669 --> 00:12:57.960
every mother-in-law and
daughter in law have friction--

00:12:57.960 --> 00:12:59.126
CLIFF REDEKER: Right. right.

00:12:59.126 --> 00:13:00.900
EKTA KAPOOR: --have
friction, because

00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:09.554
of the social
expectation put on women.

00:13:09.554 --> 00:13:10.970
As a daughter-in-law,
I'm supposed

00:13:10.970 --> 00:13:12.640
to accept this whole
family as my own.

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:14.140
And as a mother-in-law,
I'm supposed

00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:15.450
to accept a new person.

00:13:15.450 --> 00:13:18.220
Even your own body, when
you get a foreign body part,

00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:20.590
it takes time to adjust.

00:13:20.590 --> 00:13:24.910
So But men don't
have to do that.

00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:26.760
And we see that
women have problems.

00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:27.884
CLIFF REDEKER: And that's--

00:13:27.884 --> 00:13:28.823
[LAUGHING]

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:32.505
And that's a recurring theme
through many of your shows,

00:13:32.505 --> 00:13:34.470
so that's pretty cool.

00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:36.640
You know, looking at
production-- like you said,

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:37.530
you've directed.

00:13:37.530 --> 00:13:38.840
You've produced.

00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:41.060
What aspect is your
favorite, and what--

00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:41.935
EKTA KAPOOR: Writing.

00:13:41.935 --> 00:13:43.630
CLIFF REDEKER: --sort of takes
you the most time to learn?

00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:44.505
EKTA KAPOOR: Writing.

00:13:44.505 --> 00:13:48.200
I think every time write a
new character or a new person,

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:51.760
I write knowing their
taste, where they come from,

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:54.220
how they are, how
their family life is,

00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:56.130
how their romance will be.

00:13:56.130 --> 00:13:58.210
How every time there's
a Cinderella story,

00:13:58.210 --> 00:14:03.150
I feel I'm living that emotion
again with this new character.

00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:05.170
I think I love writing.

00:14:05.170 --> 00:14:06.780
CLIFF REDEKER: Oh, nice.

00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:10.189
And then is there-- do you write
some things that don't make it

00:14:10.189 --> 00:14:11.230
into the show eventually?

00:14:11.230 --> 00:14:16.353
Like, are you writing long
biographies of these characters

00:14:16.353 --> 00:14:17.600
that-- just to set the scene?

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:18.250
EKTA KAPOOR: I
don't think-- yeah.

00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:19.870
I think eventually,
sometimes what

00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:22.430
you write never comes on air.

00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:24.500
But at the end of the
day, you have to know it.

00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:25.510
When you're writing
a character, you

00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:27.135
have to know where
they're coming from.

00:14:27.135 --> 00:14:28.840
You may never use
that information,

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:30.170
but you have to know it.

00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:32.710
You just have to mark
the journey better.

00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:37.647
We all are a product
of our experiences.

00:14:37.647 --> 00:14:39.480
CLIFF REDEKER: Are you
creating characters--

00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:41.152
are you creating
characters for actors,

00:14:41.152 --> 00:14:43.360
or are you bringing actors
to become your characters?

00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:45.443
EKTA KAPOOR: I never create
characters for actors,

00:14:45.443 --> 00:14:48.980
except for [INAUDIBLE], who
I have created characters

00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:51.451
for because I think
she's a brilliant actor.

00:14:51.451 --> 00:14:53.700
And there are times when
I've created-- I often think,

00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:56.910
OK, this actor will have to
play and sometimes I waited.

00:14:56.910 --> 00:15:01.390
But 95% of the time, I
just create the character.

00:15:01.390 --> 00:15:04.080
I'm almost like how a
doctor sees an audition.

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:06.770
I just see an
audition as blankly.

00:15:06.770 --> 00:15:08.920
I hate nepotism,
so I don't know who

00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:10.510
the person is in front of me.

00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:12.980
I don't find out about anybody
or work what they've done.

00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:14.680
I just see the
character, and I feel

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:17.745
actor I feel OK, this person--
you just know it instinctively

00:15:17.745 --> 00:15:19.880
if they'll suit your show.

00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:23.580
I think that's the reason most
drama actors have so easily fit

00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:25.030
in as a glove with
the character.

00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:27.730
Because, I mean, when I
saw Divyanka's audition,

00:15:27.730 --> 00:15:29.720
I didn't know what
she had done before.

00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:32.690
But I knew that she
has to be Ishita.

00:15:32.690 --> 00:15:35.202
Same for all the
other characters.

00:15:35.202 --> 00:15:36.660
CLIFF REDEKER: And
your shows touch

00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:39.420
on a wide variety of
subject matter and really

00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:41.750
weighty and heavy
issues, too, so how

00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:46.010
do you choose which subjects
to address in your serials?

00:15:46.010 --> 00:15:49.410
EKTA KAPOOR: So I feel like
television is so much writing--

00:15:49.410 --> 00:15:52.290
you're writing an episode
a day for every show--

00:15:52.290 --> 00:15:56.070
that there's enough
scope to actually explore

00:15:56.070 --> 00:16:02.370
all aspects of a person
or a story with humor.

00:16:02.370 --> 00:16:04.590
Sometimes you get
extremely dramatic.

00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:07.515
Sometimes you get
extremely shock-oriented.

00:16:07.515 --> 00:16:09.390
But at the same time,
you play a lot of humor

00:16:09.390 --> 00:16:12.690
in shows, because I think
there's so much time

00:16:12.690 --> 00:16:15.090
and to plan out
these stories, then

00:16:15.090 --> 00:16:16.951
you'll end up doing all of it.

00:16:16.951 --> 00:16:17.950
CLIFF REDEKER: OK, cool.

00:16:17.950 --> 00:16:20.190
And then I also wanted to
shift a little bit more

00:16:20.190 --> 00:16:22.905
to the state of the
industry in India.

00:16:22.905 --> 00:16:25.330
Like, where do you
think it's going?

00:16:25.330 --> 00:16:28.140
You already talked about
the need to segment shows

00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:30.790
for the folks living
in metropolitan areas,

00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:31.620
rural areas.

00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:34.270
There's obviously a global
audience these days.

00:16:34.270 --> 00:16:36.719
What do you think is next
for your industry to conquer?

00:16:36.719 --> 00:16:38.510
EKTA KAPOOR: So as I
said, most consumption

00:16:38.510 --> 00:16:40.520
is now happening on
the digital television.

00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:42.880
And appointment viewing
and family viewing

00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:44.820
is becoming more like
a time oriented thing.

00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:47.420
I don't want to watch two hours,
but I'd rather not watch TV.

00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:50.420
I'd rather spend it having
dinner with my family.

00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:53.080
TV viewing or
episode consumption

00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:55.100
is becoming more
individualistic,

00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:56.590
except in small
towns, especially

00:16:56.590 --> 00:16:58.660
for the global
[INAUDIBLE] on the move.

00:16:58.660 --> 00:16:59.780
I have an hour.

00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:02.590
I'll go to my mobile,
check the last episode

00:17:02.590 --> 00:17:05.660
of "Orange is the New
Black" or "House of Cards,"

00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:07.099
and then I move on with life.

00:17:07.099 --> 00:17:09.859
So with that being
individual viewing,

00:17:09.859 --> 00:17:11.740
I don't have to actually watch.

00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:14.950
Like I did a show a year
and a half ago in India.

00:17:14.950 --> 00:17:17.750
I thought it was
really nicely made.

00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:21.569
It was about second chances,
about a woman moving on

00:17:21.569 --> 00:17:24.530
after having a very bad
marriage and getting

00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:29.640
just friendly with this man
who comes into her life.

00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:32.140
It didn't work,
because 80% of India

00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:35.330
couldn't watch it
with their husbands.

00:17:35.330 --> 00:17:38.080
So it became tough
for them, saying

00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:40.580
that we want to watch the show,
but every time, my husband

00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:42.890
says, why are you
watching this show?

00:17:42.890 --> 00:17:49.520
So, I mean, the show died
due to a lot of insecurity.

00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:52.150
But I realized that it would
be a perfect show for the app,

00:17:52.150 --> 00:17:53.483
because it's individual viewing.

00:17:53.483 --> 00:17:56.190
You can watch a
story on your own.

00:17:56.190 --> 00:17:59.900
CLIFF REDEKER: And then the
other side of online viewing,

00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:01.761
of course, is binge
watching and watching

00:18:01.761 --> 00:18:03.010
more than one episode at once.

00:18:03.010 --> 00:18:04.010
EKTA KAPOOR: Absolutely.

00:18:04.010 --> 00:18:06.204
You just watch a story
at one go, finish it off,

00:18:06.204 --> 00:18:07.870
then hopefully wait
for the next season.

00:18:07.870 --> 00:18:09.990
Or then, say, after
four episodes,

00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:11.310
you don't want to watch it.

00:18:11.310 --> 00:18:12.732
But-- yeah.

00:18:12.732 --> 00:18:14.690
So you don't have to
watch half hour every day,

00:18:14.690 --> 00:18:16.314
and it doesn't have
to be 100 episodes.

00:18:16.314 --> 00:18:19.480
You just can enjoy
high-impact, great storytelling

00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:22.084
in smaller, shorter formats.

00:18:22.084 --> 00:18:22.750
That's the plan.

00:18:22.750 --> 00:18:24.060
CLIFF REDEKER: Well,
hopefully folks

00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:25.260
will use the app for that.

00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:27.310
How do you plan to grow
that as a business?

00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:29.070
Is there going to be
a subscription model?

00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:30.990
EKTA KAPOOR: It's a
subscription model.

00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:32.520
It's-- for the
international Indian,

00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:35.800
about $2 per month for the app,
which is way less than what

00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:37.024
other channels pay.

00:18:37.024 --> 00:18:38.690
And it's going to be
30 new shows a year

00:18:38.690 --> 00:18:41.490
with a lot of top television
actors, film actors.

00:18:41.490 --> 00:18:43.240
Lots of programming, of course.

00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:44.342
Different languages.

00:18:44.342 --> 00:18:46.300
And of course, the fun
part of this whole thing

00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:49.180
is that I am not
looking at turning it

00:18:49.180 --> 00:18:51.730
into profitable
venture the first year.

00:18:51.730 --> 00:18:53.224
It's two, three years.

00:18:53.224 --> 00:18:55.140
I think the moment you
start seeing the shows,

00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:58.180
you'll know what-- I can't
even explain what I'm doing.

00:18:58.180 --> 00:19:00.610
There's no way to say what
kind of programming it will be.

00:19:00.610 --> 00:19:02.240
Will it be like "Kyo
Kii" or will it be

00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:03.670
like "Dirty Picture"?

00:19:03.670 --> 00:19:05.379
I'm like, it's going
to be a bit of both.

00:19:05.379 --> 00:19:07.003
CLIFF REDEKER: It's
going to be-- yeah,

00:19:07.003 --> 00:19:07.891
it's on it's own end.

00:19:07.891 --> 00:19:08.390
Yeah.

00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:12.130
And you know, your career in
the industry-- it's been 15,

00:19:12.130 --> 00:19:15.390
20 years since you've started
making a mark on the--

00:19:15.390 --> 00:19:17.210
EKTA KAPOOR: I
started 22 years ago.

00:19:17.210 --> 00:19:18.820
CLIFF REDEKER: Yeah, so any--

00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:21.194
EKTA KAPOOR: And that doesn't
have to speak about my age.

00:19:21.194 --> 00:19:22.260
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:26.670
CLIFF REDEKER: Started
when you were six.

00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:29.520
So you've been through
highs and lows.

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:31.490
Like, obviously things
are very successful now.

00:19:31.490 --> 00:19:33.540
You're expanding into new areas.

00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:35.420
But there were times
that were more rough.

00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:38.413
How did you approach
learning from some failures?

00:19:38.413 --> 00:19:41.270
It's a tradition we carry
on here at Google as well.

00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:44.350
EKTA KAPOOR: So, like from
being on top, 36 out of 50

00:19:44.350 --> 00:19:49.370
shows-- I was in one year
without one show in top 50.

00:19:49.370 --> 00:19:53.230
So, I mean, you just realize
that anything and everything

00:19:53.230 --> 00:19:53.890
in life passes.

00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:59.500
I believe in the
five ball theory,

00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:01.484
which is that you've
got to keep juggling

00:20:01.484 --> 00:20:02.650
the five balls of your life.

00:20:02.650 --> 00:20:03.820
One is your family.

00:20:03.820 --> 00:20:05.050
One is your love life.

00:20:05.050 --> 00:20:07.490
One is your health.

00:20:07.490 --> 00:20:15.980
One is your work, and
one is your own success.

00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:19.160
And at the end of the
day, the only two balls

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:22.050
which are made of glass
is health and family.

00:20:22.050 --> 00:20:23.090
So the others can fall.

00:20:23.090 --> 00:20:25.330
They'll bounce back.

00:20:25.330 --> 00:20:29.240
But these two, if they fall,
they never bounce back.

00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:31.880
So I try to juggle
all the five balls,

00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:34.890
but these two I see
that I manage better.

00:20:34.890 --> 00:20:38.750
And career I realize one thing--
that you can do the best shows,

00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:42.250
but it's success or
failures on your hands.

00:20:42.250 --> 00:20:44.530
At the end of the day, you
should enjoy the journey,

00:20:44.530 --> 00:20:46.850
take the set backs with a smile.

00:20:46.850 --> 00:20:48.310
It passes.

00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:51.580
Things keep happening which
are not in your control.

00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:56.190
Sometimes a deal cannot happen
because there's been a global

00:20:56.190 --> 00:20:57.320
meltdown.

00:20:57.320 --> 00:20:57.890
Like, hello?

00:20:57.890 --> 00:20:59.330
What did I do in this part?

00:20:59.330 --> 00:20:59.630
CLIFF REDEKER: Right.

00:20:59.630 --> 00:21:00.130
Right.

00:21:00.130 --> 00:21:02.552
Things that are inside
your control and outside.

00:21:02.552 --> 00:21:04.510
So you think you're
juggling pretty well today?

00:21:04.510 --> 00:21:04.820
Or--

00:21:04.820 --> 00:21:07.069
EKTA KAPOOR: I don't know
if I'm juggling pretty well,

00:21:07.069 --> 00:21:11.030
but I constantly try to
see that I keep perspective

00:21:11.030 --> 00:21:13.650
while keeping my
eye on the wall.

00:21:13.650 --> 00:21:16.868
I still try to keep perspective.

00:21:16.868 --> 00:21:18.820
CLIFF REDEKER: That's cool.

00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:22.020
And then what would you say
your proudest moment has been,

00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:27.520
apart from overseeing this
cricket league and everything?

00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:29.260
EKTA KAPOOR: My
proudest moment--

00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:32.940
I don't think I've-- I've had
a lot of ups and downs to have

00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:35.660
any proudest moment.

00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:47.040
But I think-- I've had
these days in my life

00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:53.760
where I've been told that--
just moments at that time when

00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:56.360
you look back at your life,
and you see you actually

00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:58.310
started from a garage.

00:21:58.310 --> 00:22:01.360
And you actually were somebody
that no one expected anything

00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:02.680
from.

00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:03.850
That makes you think, OK.

00:22:03.850 --> 00:22:05.120
Not bad.

00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:07.800
So I have really not
had any proud moment.

00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:10.050
Because I really actually
collected just now after you

00:22:10.050 --> 00:22:11.920
said, and I couldn't
even think of one.

00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:13.340
CLIFF REDEKER: Well, it's
the journey, like you said.

00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:14.080
It's just the hard work--

00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:16.038
EKTA KAPOOR: It's just
great days and bad days,

00:22:16.038 --> 00:22:17.749
and I think we all have them.

00:22:17.749 --> 00:22:19.290
CLIFF REDEKER: So
what sort of advice

00:22:19.290 --> 00:22:22.060
would you give to the next
generation of people entering

00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:23.890
the industry?

00:22:23.890 --> 00:22:25.820
EKTA KAPOOR: So I never
take my competition

00:22:25.820 --> 00:22:30.350
as the big daddies or the big
global conglomerates out there.

00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:33.010
It's always the new guy
sitting in the garage that

00:22:33.010 --> 00:22:34.729
is the big, big fear.

00:22:34.729 --> 00:22:36.145
Because he's the
man who's hungry.

00:22:36.145 --> 00:22:40.210
He's the man with the new ideas.

00:22:40.210 --> 00:22:43.150
He's the one who will
come in and revolutionize

00:22:43.150 --> 00:22:44.280
the world again.

00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:47.350
So he or she, whoever's
in the garage-- just

00:22:47.350 --> 00:22:49.780
go ahead and do what you
want, because there is

00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:51.876
no outcome that is guaranteed.

00:22:51.876 --> 00:22:54.042
All you can guarantee is
that you enjoy the journey.

00:22:54.042 --> 00:22:55.810
CLIFF REDEKER: And
I know you've tried.

00:22:55.810 --> 00:22:58.580
I think we have time for maybe
one or two audience questions

00:22:58.580 --> 00:23:00.530
if there's something
burning in your mind.

00:23:00.530 --> 00:23:01.930
I guess we have one
up here in the front.

00:23:01.930 --> 00:23:02.805
We have a microphone.

00:23:02.805 --> 00:23:04.725
SPEAKER: Yeah, so there you go.

00:23:04.725 --> 00:23:05.516
AUDIENCE: Hi, Ekta.

00:23:05.516 --> 00:23:05.970
EKTA KAPOOR: Hi.

00:23:05.970 --> 00:23:06.610
AUDIENCE: I'm Kavita.

00:23:06.610 --> 00:23:07.610
EKTA KAPOOR: Hi, Kavita.

00:23:07.610 --> 00:23:09.840
AUDIENCE: So I have
a question for you.

00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:13.230
What made you pick
letter K for your shows

00:23:13.230 --> 00:23:15.422
and move on to
other letters now?

00:23:15.422 --> 00:23:16.380
CLIFF REDEKER: Oh, yes.

00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:17.132
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:17.132 --> 00:23:18.440
That was on my list, too.

00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:19.850
EKTA KAPOOR: OK.

00:23:19.850 --> 00:23:22.170
So in India at one
time, a lot of people

00:23:22.170 --> 00:23:25.756
thought it was only astrology,
which is a part of it.

00:23:25.756 --> 00:23:27.590
Someone had told me
that K would suit me,

00:23:27.590 --> 00:23:29.970
and I said if it's
working, why not continue.

00:23:29.970 --> 00:23:33.450
After some time, it was-- I
did get couple of flops also.

00:23:33.450 --> 00:23:35.930
And I was like, OK, now I
need to change the alphabet.

00:23:35.930 --> 00:23:39.770
But then I said, what really
worked with the brand was

00:23:39.770 --> 00:23:42.500
becoming synonymous with it.

00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:45.940
People who couldn't even
understand English or Hindi,

00:23:45.940 --> 00:23:50.800
or couldn't read-- I'm talking
about mass India-- could hear K

00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:52.010
and knew it's my show.

00:23:52.010 --> 00:23:53.150
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.

00:23:53.150 --> 00:23:56.320
EKTA KAPOOR: And then it
became my own brand recall.

00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:57.740
So I said, why change it?

00:23:57.740 --> 00:24:00.980
Till there were so many spin
offs with the same letter

00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:05.990
that the brand started losing
its fabric of personality.

00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:08.360
And the [INAUDIBLE]
made its own version,

00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:11.200
so then it was the
time to revamp,

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:12.599
like happens with any brand.

00:24:12.599 --> 00:24:14.515
CLIFF REDEKER: Well,
just like here at Google,

00:24:14.515 --> 00:24:16.030
we make our way
through the alphabet

00:24:16.030 --> 00:24:18.575
when we name
versions of Android.

00:24:18.575 --> 00:24:20.587
Now we have a
question in the back,

00:24:20.587 --> 00:24:22.170
and then we'll cut
to the one up here.

00:24:22.170 --> 00:24:25.940
So if you could
please pass that--

00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:28.376
I guess we'll-- you're
closer on the list.

00:24:31.082 --> 00:24:31.623
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:24:31.623 --> 00:24:32.430
Hi, Ekta.

00:24:32.430 --> 00:24:33.370
EKTA KAPOOR: Hi.

00:24:33.370 --> 00:24:35.220
AUDIENCE: I just
wanted to find out

00:24:35.220 --> 00:24:39.870
what did you feel about
[INAUDIBLE] then and now?

00:24:39.870 --> 00:24:43.680
EKTA KAPOOR: So I feel
then she was smart,

00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:49.290
extremely hard working,
extremely focused young girl.

00:24:49.290 --> 00:24:52.560
Now I feel that she is an
extremely hard working,

00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:56.000
extremely smart woman.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.150
I think except for her
age, nothing has changed.

00:24:58.150 --> 00:24:59.080
I keep meeting her.

00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:00.094
She is the same.

00:25:00.094 --> 00:25:01.010
AUDIENCE: That's nice.

00:25:01.010 --> 00:25:04.810
EKTA KAPOOR: She
is extremely hungry

00:25:04.810 --> 00:25:09.650
to do something to change
the universe, the world,

00:25:09.650 --> 00:25:11.470
the country she lives in.

00:25:11.470 --> 00:25:14.730
Which is when-- if you see
the way she has to act,

00:25:14.730 --> 00:25:16.160
it was extremely forceful.

00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:18.078
It was extremely passionate.

00:25:18.078 --> 00:25:25.160
I think rarely do people who
conform or fit into boxes

00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:26.285
make history.

00:25:26.285 --> 00:25:29.480
I think she's one woman
who will make history,

00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:33.140
so you won't find her following
anywhere the beaten path.

00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:34.010
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:25:34.010 --> 00:25:35.760
SPEAKER: So we just
have time for one more

00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:37.829
question over here.

00:25:37.829 --> 00:25:38.620
AUDIENCE: Hi, Ekta.

00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:39.870
My name is [INAUDIBLE] Moza.

00:25:39.870 --> 00:25:41.240
I'll tell you one secret first.

00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:43.610
There is an actor
inside every engineer.

00:25:43.610 --> 00:25:45.111
I'm sure most of
them will agree.

00:25:45.111 --> 00:25:47.610
And this is coming from somebody
who's acted in your "Kyunki

00:25:47.610 --> 00:25:48.727
Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi."

00:25:48.727 --> 00:25:49.560
EKTA KAPOOR: Really?

00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:51.350
AUDIENCE: Question
is, when would you

00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:55.650
start casting actors from US,
California, outside India?

00:25:55.650 --> 00:25:57.870
EKTA KAPOOR: So part
of the app's function

00:25:57.870 --> 00:26:00.950
is going to be
casting, where you

00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:02.940
can upload an audition to me.

00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:05.840
And we'll be putting
out the various--

00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:08.670
so actually, I didn't
tell this, but I

00:26:08.670 --> 00:26:10.590
did a lot of casting
through Facebook

00:26:10.590 --> 00:26:16.110
and this-- people used to write
to me and ask to see them act.

00:26:16.110 --> 00:26:18.720
And then, of course,
after it became well known

00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:21.940
that I'd cast [INAUDIBLE]
through an audition I saw off

00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:28.480
his-- which he just sent me
on FB, of course my account

00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:30.910
crashed.

00:26:30.910 --> 00:26:34.696
But I think it's the way
forward and, of course,

00:26:34.696 --> 00:26:36.570
is going to be-- I'm
going to be setting up--

00:26:36.570 --> 00:26:39.510
a big function of the app would
be a community that will be

00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:41.310
of actors all over the world.

00:26:41.310 --> 00:26:43.283
Because the whole idea
is if you're making sure

00:26:43.283 --> 00:26:44.699
there are global
Indians, then you

00:26:44.699 --> 00:26:47.434
want to be shooting
globally for them.

00:26:47.434 --> 00:26:49.100
You need actors from
all over the world.

00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:52.030
And I'm hoping to
launch lots of actors

00:26:52.030 --> 00:26:53.256
from every part of the world.

00:26:53.256 --> 00:26:55.130
There's going to be like
an audition put out,

00:26:55.130 --> 00:26:58.690
and you just have to then
do an addition wherever

00:26:58.690 --> 00:27:02.715
you are on your mobile and
send it, and you get cast.

00:27:02.715 --> 00:27:04.870
CLIFF REDEKER: So that
means there's hope for me.

00:27:04.870 --> 00:27:06.036
I need to download this app.

00:27:06.036 --> 00:27:07.310
That's pretty amazing.

00:27:07.310 --> 00:27:09.870
EKTA KAPOOR: I actually
think the world is becoming

00:27:09.870 --> 00:27:13.840
like a big global
village, and stories

00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:16.230
are going to be about
everyone living everywhere.

00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:18.360
I think we're going to be far
more connected than we thought.

00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:18.940
CLIFF REDEKER: So does this--

00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:20.356
EKTA KAPOOR: And you
guys are helping.

00:27:20.356 --> 00:27:20.828
CLIFF REDEKER: Thank you.

00:27:20.828 --> 00:27:21.328
Yeah.

00:27:21.328 --> 00:27:23.630
And so-- yeah,
we're pretty there.

00:27:23.630 --> 00:27:28.300
You know I was voted the
best-dressed male at Google

00:27:28.300 --> 00:27:29.490
Diwali 2013, so--

00:27:29.490 --> 00:27:30.380
EKTA KAPOOR: Lovely.

00:27:30.380 --> 00:27:31.260
Lovely.

00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:32.700
CLIFF REDEKER: --that
passes the first round.

00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:33.790
EKTA KAPOOR: I would
give you my vote.

00:27:33.790 --> 00:27:35.190
CLIFF REDEKER: Oh, thank you.

00:27:35.190 --> 00:27:37.110
So does that mean
you want to start

00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:39.202
doing-- you're producing
shows in America

00:27:39.202 --> 00:27:40.410
or will you stick with India?

00:27:40.410 --> 00:27:41.220
EKTA KAPOOR: So I'm
actually shooting

00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:43.250
a film in the next
few days in America,

00:27:43.250 --> 00:27:45.950
shooting in New York, called
"Half Girlfriend" with Mohit

00:27:45.950 --> 00:27:48.690
Suri, and Arjun, and Shraddha.

00:27:48.690 --> 00:27:49.760
But yeah.

00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:50.500
I would love to.

00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:53.600
I mean, in fact I'm shooting
another show of mine which

00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:58.010
is about-- which is on Star Plus
which is about two people who

00:27:58.010 --> 00:27:59.380
fall in love.

00:27:59.380 --> 00:28:00.880
I've heard so many
of these stories.

00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:03.970
It actually started-- I
wanted to shoot it in Canada,

00:28:03.970 --> 00:28:06.020
but I'm shooting in Austria now.

00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:08.870
It started with this
dodgy taxi driver,

00:28:08.870 --> 00:28:11.350
who was telling me how
he and his wife-- he

00:28:11.350 --> 00:28:14.680
got married to a woman--
went, married her

00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:17.235
in like a [INAUDIBLE] or
something and came here.

00:28:17.235 --> 00:28:18.320
So that's the story.

00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:22.000
It's about these two people
who are in a foreign land,

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.080
so it's actually an
[INAUDIBLE] show,

00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:31.350
and how they connect with each
other in a totally alien world

00:28:31.350 --> 00:28:33.640
and become a part of
each other's lives.

00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:35.610
So that's my next show.

00:28:35.610 --> 00:28:38.020
Actually, it's
called [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:38.020 --> 00:28:40.740
It's coming on Starz,
so it's-- actually,

00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:43.310
and the whole show is going
to be shot in Austria.

00:28:43.310 --> 00:28:47.040
Because it's actually was
based first in Canada,

00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:49.767
in [INAUDIBLE] family.

00:28:49.767 --> 00:28:50.600
CLIFF REDEKER: Cool.

00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:51.110
Very nice.

00:28:51.110 --> 00:28:53.242
So we want to thank you
for stopping by today.

00:28:53.242 --> 00:28:54.200
EKTA KAPOOR: Thank you.

00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:56.075
CLIFF REDEKER: The app
coming out in November

00:28:56.075 --> 00:28:58.932
on iOS and Google
Play, the whole deal.

00:28:58.932 --> 00:29:01.482
And we look forward seeing
continued news of your success.

00:29:01.482 --> 00:29:03.440
Thank you very much for
speaking with us today.

00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:03.740
EKTA KAPOOR: Thank you so much.

00:29:03.740 --> 00:29:04.340
CLIFF REDEKER: Thank you.

00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:04.940
Ekta Kapoor.

00:29:04.940 --> 00:29:07.311
[APPLAUSE]
