00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.720
&gt;&gt; From The Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:08.560
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: This is the
third time I've done this,

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:10.450 position:56%
and I've had so much fun every time.

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:14.520
And I've been so excited to see
so many people who love books.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:18.210
It's just wonderful to be
with a crowd of book lovers.

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.070
This is also not the first time
I have met Alice McDermott.

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.910
We have spoken before.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.180
I visited her at her house in 2002,

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.920
when her book Child
of My Heart came out.

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.990
But yesterday I went through the
NPR archives to confirm something

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:35.130
that I thought I'd
remembered, but, you know,

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.650
you forget things these days.

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:42.220
I interviewed you for your second
book, which was that night.

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:43.720
And I don't know if
you even remember it,

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.290
but it's in the NPR archives.

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:46.590
&gt;&gt; Then it must be true.

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:47.890
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: So it has be true.

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:52.950
So I feel a certain sort of like I
helped the public get to know you

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:56.900
and a certain sense of
ownership, which I also think comes

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:01.660
with the fact that we are both
Irish-Catholic New Yorkers.

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.020
Now her family ended
up going to Brooklyn.

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:06.850
Mine went to the Bronx.

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.480
Brooklyn to Long Island,
the Bronx to Westchester,

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.530
which was a very common
sort of thing.

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.590
But I think I totally
understand your characters.

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.740
I mean they're not necessarily
people I ever met, as I was growing

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.120
up in the Irish-Catholic world,
but there's something about them

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.710
that you really are able to get at
what the heart of that culture is.

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.380
And so I have always
identified with that.

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.550
But I think many people
learned about Alice

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:36.950
when she won the National Book
Award in 1998 for Charming Billy.

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.470
And I'm just going to come
right out and say this.

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.470
The Ninth Hour is my favorite
book since Charming Billy.

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:46.360
This is really a wonderful book.

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.770
And I know that nobody's really
had a chance to read it yet,

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:50.640
because it's not out
there on the shelves.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.140
So I'm going to ask Alice, so
that we can talk about it a bit,

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.000
to just give a little bit of
a summary of The Ninth Hour.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.010
Tell us. Give us a little bit of an
idea of what this story is about.

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:06.310
&gt;&gt; Alice McDermott:
Well, thank you, first.

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.450
And thank you, all of you, for
being here and for reading.

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:10.750
Thank you.

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.030
[Applause] Yeah, to you.

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:23.400
This novel, what it's about
essentially, is a group of nuns.

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.080
Sorry, I wrote about nuns.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.780
In a small convent
in, yes, Brooklyn.

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.460
A group of nursing sisters.

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:37.250
This is an order that's sort of
an amalgamation of many orders

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.900
that actually existed,
but I had to create my own

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.620
for the purposes of the fiction.

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:48.350 position:56%
A group of women who essentially
served the poor in every kind of way

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:54.160
from babysitting to housecleaning,
to actual nursing, childbirth,

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.410
all that in these neighborhoods.

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:04.040
In the novel they sort
of adopt a young widow.

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.500
Her husband has committed suicide.

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:11.650
And the novel kind of follows
her life with the nuns,

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:17.700
but it's also about the
generation looking back at this.

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.720
That's kind of what
the story is about.

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.610
But the meaning for
me, of the novel,

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:32.280
or what I wrote the novel for,
I suppose, is more of a kind

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.200
of a meditation on selflessness,

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:42.590
a concept that I think is fading
rapidly in the 21st Century,

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:47.990
that sense of giving of one's self.

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:55.860
And oddly enough, one of the sparks
for this novel had nothing to do

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.810
with Brooklyn or nuns,
or Catholicism.

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:03.700
I really thought maybe I was
going to escape all those things

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:09.260
in this novel, because the very
first germ of the story which came

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:13.930
to me years and years ago arose
out of a conversation I've had

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:19.680
with a friend who had a vague
recollection of a man who lived

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.640
in his grandfather's
house way upstate New York

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:30.040
who had been his grandfather's
substitute in The Civil War,

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:32.030
or his great grandfather.

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:36.730
And the idea of substitute
just fascinated me,

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:42.880
and it sort of had resonance of
the military now, the substitutes,

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.520
the people who go so
we don't have to.

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.090
And I started doing just
research like maybe I'm going

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:49.970
to write a Civil War novel.

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:52.740
Wouldn't that surprise everyone?

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:59.350
[Laughter] Eventually that became
a very small part of the novel.

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:05.860
But that idea of taking someone's
place, putting your own life

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:10.780
on the lin for someone else either
for money, as many substitutes

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:15.680
in The Civil War did,
for some greater good,

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.100
for some greater glory.

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.950
And then as soon as I got to the
greater glory, I thought, oh, my,

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:22.510
God, it's going to be
another Catholic novel.

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:25.110
[ Laughter ]

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:27.020
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: Well, I have to
admit that when I heard it was

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:30.540
about a convent of nuns I
thought, well, of course.

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:33.870
She had to eventually
get to the nuns, really.

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:35.170
&gt;&gt; Alice McDermott: Honestly.

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:36.470
Don't you think?

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:37.770
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: Played a pretty
big role in the lives of anybody

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:40.190
who grew up Catholic
at a certain time.

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:41.490
&gt;&gt; Alice McDermott: Yes.

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:45.730
Yeah, and I did have that sense
of especially this, New York,

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:49.050
and I think probably any of
the major east coast cities.

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:52.640
Even in my lifetime, I remember
walking through the streets

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:56.340
of Brooklyn in the
late '50s or the '60s.

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:58.580
Nuns were everywhere.

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:00.980
And if you notice,
you never see them

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:05.250
in contemporary film
of street scenes.

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:13.450
I came across just a few weeks
ago a Norman Rockwell painting

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:16.890 position:56%
of Union Station in Chicago in 1942.

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:19.210
Now I have a scene in
Union Station in Chicago,

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:21.810
but it would be more
like the late '20s.

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:25.530
And it's a crowd scene and, of
course, there are soldiers in it.

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:29.260
And right at the center
are two nuns.

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:35.290
And it really brought home to
me how much they were there

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:39.740
and how they have been
somewhat erased from our memory.

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:44.440
So there was also that
incentive to bring them back

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:48.100
and bring their lives
back to our awareness.

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:49.970
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: Because I was
thinking to myself, you know,

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:54.220
it's almost as though, people,
nuns are now parodied very much.

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:55.520
&gt;&gt; Alice McDermott: Oh,
my gosh, yeah, sure.

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:56.820
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: Did you
worry about that at all,

00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:58.850
in terms of creating
these characters?

00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:01.780
I mean Sister Saint Sebastian
is the name of one of them,

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:05.030
and you can tell us
the name of the order.

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:07.480
&gt;&gt; Alice McDermott: The Little
Nursing Sisters of the Sick,

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:09.860
Poor Congregation of
Mary before the Cross.

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:11.660
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: Okay.

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:16.090
[ Laughter ]

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:18.480
&gt;&gt; Alice McDermott: Yes, and of
course they've been parodied.

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:19.780
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: And
did you worry at all

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:21.420
about getting close to that line?

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:22.720
&gt;&gt; Alice McDermott: Absolutely.

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:26.280
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: Because you are
not parodying them in any way.

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:29.720
You really are creating
the world they were in

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:32.560
and presenting them
as these caretakers.

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:35.490
And I know caretakers, from
past times that we've talked,

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:37.160
this is something that's
interesting to you.

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:40.260
These women were nurses who cared
about the people they took care of.

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.230
&gt;&gt; Alice McDermott:
Absolutely, and worked very hard.

00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:46.650 position:56%
And I think that was one reason that
I knew right away that if I were

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:50.190
to write about nuns, I couldn't
make them teaching orders.

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:51.990
Not that the teaching
orders shouldn't.

00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:55.470
You know, those of us who still
know how to diagram a sentence,

00:07:55.470 --> 00:08:00.140
most of us learned it from a nun.

00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:02.690
[Laughter] I shouldn't say us.

00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:04.520
I could never diagram sentences.

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:07.390
Those of you who can
diagram sentences.

00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:09.440
But I think a lot of the parody,

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:13.800
and of course it's
comedy that's accessible

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:15.660
to us, and we should laugh.

00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:20.160
But a lot of it comes through a
contemporary view of nuns that many

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:24.260
of us formed as children, because
we remember them as teachers

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:29.720
and we remember them as Cheech
and Chong's Sister Mary Elephant.

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:36.240
But so I thought if I could focus
on a nursing order, I could do away

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:40.600
with some of that,
but still acknowledge

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:43.820
that these were independent women,

00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:46.340
that they were different,
each one of them.

00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:48.930
Even though they may have
had the same vocation,

00:08:48.930 --> 00:08:50.650
they were individuals.

00:08:50.650 --> 00:08:51.950
They worked so hard.

00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:53.310
What brought them to the convent,

00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:56.390
each one would have a different
reason for being there.

00:08:56.390 --> 00:08:59.400
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: It is a story
about nuns, but it's also a story

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:01.610
about Sally, who is the daughter.

00:09:01.610 --> 00:09:06.190
Her mother is Annie, who works
in the laundry of the convent,

00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:07.790
and that's where the
convent comes into play.

00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:11.720
And also her father has
committed suicide right

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:14.120
at the beginning of the novel.

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:17.960
And something I found really
fascinating about this novel,

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:20.130
it begins with a suicide.

00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:23.790
There's a love affair, which
is very much part of the plot.

00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:27.980
And there's somebody who suffers
from depression, we learn later on.

00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:30.670
And I thought to myself
these are three things

00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:34.610
that so many contemporary novels
are completely built around

00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:38.540
and we learn everything you need to
know about suicide, love affairs,

00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:40.760
and depression they
could possibly know.

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:45.210
And yet in this book, as
important as they are to the novel,

00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:47.990
you tell us very little about,

00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:50.680
really they never talk
about the suicide.

00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:54.550 position:56%
Once we know the affair is underway,
we never get any details of it again

00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:55.940
until much later in the book.

00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:57.240
It comes back.

00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:01.770
And the depression is kind of just,
you know, mentioned that the mother

00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:03.770
or somebody suffered
from depression.

00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:07.060
So I wondered about that restraint.

00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:08.360
Why that restraint?

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:11.210
Is that just part of the
culture that you writing about?

00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:15.700
Is it the way you like to write?

00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:18.310
&gt;&gt; Alice McDermott:
Probably both those things.

00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:23.790
I think among many little
pieces of advice, dismaying

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:28.250
and confused advice that I
give to my writing students,

00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:33.590
is be careful your stories are not
too much about what they're about.

00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:37.580
I guess wonderful looks from
them when I say that, you know,

00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:40.300
like how the hell do I do that.

00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:46.110
But I think for me, while those
things are important and part

00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:50.500
of the life of these women,
of course, I didn't want them

00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:57.940
to overwhelm the more interesting
aspect which is the dailiness of,

00:10:57.940 --> 00:10:59.730
yes, there are love affairs, yes,

00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:02.740
there are suicides,
yes, there's depression.

00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:04.710
There's confusion.

00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:06.160
There's unrequited love.

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:07.600
All those things are going on,

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:11.120
the stuff that storytellers
make so much of.

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:14.360
But underneath that, and this
is a novel that's very much

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:16.500
about what goes on underground.

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:17.800
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: Yeah.

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:19.570
&gt;&gt; Alice McDermott: There
are women doing the laundry

00:11:19.570 --> 00:11:25.320
and getting kids off to school,
and taking care of the sick

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:27.720
and taking care of the elderly.

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:34.080
And I wanted that sense, that that
engine underneath all these story

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:39.730
things in some ways is more
dramatic and more important.

00:11:39.730 --> 00:11:41.630
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: It did feel
very Irish to me as well.

00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:44.040
&gt;&gt; Alice McDermott: Oh,
well, there's that too,

00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:45.860
the things we don't speak of, yeah.

00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:48.630
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: And this
book goes into that,

00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:49.930
the things we don't speak of.

00:11:49.930 --> 00:11:51.230
&gt;&gt; Alice McDermott: Yeah.

00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:52.530
Yeah.

00:11:52.530 --> 00:11:53.830
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: I mean
it doesn't go into it.

00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:55.130
It explains.

00:11:55.130 --> 00:11:57.320
It's about that in a
lot of ways, I think.

00:11:57.320 --> 00:12:02.100 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Alice McDermott: Well, I think,
and this may as much in my DNA as is

00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:07.960
in any literary intentions
that I have.

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:12.990
I think there's a sense
or an awareness

00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:21.500
that too much language
flattens or deprives emotion

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:28.160 position:56%
of all the things we can't say, that
the power of our emotional lives

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:31.300
and even in our daily lives.

00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:34.980
The power of the things we think
and we feel, and we hope for,

00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:40.890
as soon as we try to put them
into words they become clique.

00:12:40.890 --> 00:12:43.460
They sound ordinary.

00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:47.110
They begin to sound like what
everybody else feels when every one

00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:50.090
of knows, but what we
feel is sort of different.

00:12:50.090 --> 00:12:53.180
You know, we're not anyone else.

00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:57.830
And so I think, you know, part
of it is the Irish distrust,

00:12:57.830 --> 00:13:01.330
maybe because it's a language
that is not really our own.

00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:06.720
But also I think it's the distrust
of saying too much about things

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:09.750
that language can't reach.

00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:13.260
So in some ways, being
a writer you're kind

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:15.510
of tying one hand behind your
back when you're saying, yes,

00:13:15.510 --> 00:13:20.280
I'm going to work with words, but
words can't say what I have to say.

00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:26.110
So it is a kind of indirection that
both the characters in the novel,

00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:32.090
and I suppose their author,
tries to make use of to get

00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:33.980
at those things we
have no words for.

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:37.500
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: I wanted to ask you
about your beginnings as a writer,

00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:40.140
because I read that, you know,

00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:42.990
growing up you never thought
you could be a writer.

00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:47.260
It wasn't something you ever
thought of, as a possible career.

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:51.590
But that your professor in college
did something very interesting,

00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:53.170
and that sort of started
you off on the path.

00:13:53.170 --> 00:13:54.500
And I wonder if you
can tell us that story.

00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:55.800
&gt;&gt; Alice McDermott: Yes.

00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:58.400
Yeah. I was one of those
kids who always wrote.

00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:02.470
I couldn't draw, but it was a way
of sort of controlling the world.

00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:07.200
I had two older brothers
who both became lawyers.

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:11.510
So they spoke constantly
at the dinner table.

00:14:11.510 --> 00:14:14.680
[Laughter] My father, who
pontificated quite a bit,

00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:20.930
and I never got to complete a
sentence probably until I was 18.

00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:24.380
So writing was a way of going
off and saying, well, yeah,

00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:29.330
I should have said here's my story.

00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:33.340
But to make a leap from that,
I think a lot of children draw

00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:37.980
and write and use that
as a way of getting hold

00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:40.470
of a world that confuses them.

00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:43.230
So making the leap from that
to that this was something

00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:46.100
that you could actually
do to make a living.

00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:48.620
When I finally broke it to my
parents that I was sort of leaning

00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:53.120
that way, their advice was go to
Katie Gibbs Secretarial School.

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:54.420
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: I got
the same advice.

00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:55.720
&gt;&gt; Alice McDermott: Yes, of course.

00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:57.020
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: If you were
an Irish-Catholic New Yorker

00:14:57.020 --> 00:14:58.320
at a certain point,
you got that advice.

00:14:58.320 --> 00:14:59.920
&gt;&gt; Alice McDermott: Katie
Gibbs was the place to go.

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:01.850
Get your shorthand and you can work

00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:05.820
in a publishing house,
if you like books.

00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:11.520 position:56%
My first year I went to Oswego
State, one of the state universities

00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:15.840
of New York, which I chose to go
to because it had been rated one

00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:19.300
of the top three party
schools that year.

00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:21.790
[Laughter] That's how
serious a student I was.

00:15:21.790 --> 00:15:25.330
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: I don't think of you
as a party girl, but that's okay.

00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:30.820
&gt;&gt; Alice McDermott: That's why I
needed to go to a party school.

00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:35.880
And because I loved writing
and reading, I took a class

00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:37.710
that promised that we
could do some writing.

00:15:37.710 --> 00:15:40.510
But it was called The Nature of
Nonfiction, and it was taught

00:15:40.510 --> 00:15:44.400
by a former journalist, a
retired Air Force Colonel

00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:47.120
who had written a biography
of Amelia Earhart,

00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:50.720
who was a no-nonsense kind of guy.

00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:55.130
And our first assignment was to
write an autobiographical essay,

00:15:55.130 --> 00:15:56.750
which I went off and did.

00:15:56.750 --> 00:15:58.550
And, of course, I made
up every word of it.

00:15:58.550 --> 00:16:00.820
Nothing. I write it
in the first person,

00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:03.230
but nothing that I described
had actually happened to me.

00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:06.130
It was fiction.

00:16:06.130 --> 00:16:09.930
And in those days he
was into audiovisual.

00:16:09.930 --> 00:16:15.840
So he would edit your work on a
screen with an overhead projector.

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:20.280
So like if you never thought
about where to put a comma before,

00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:22.450
you thought about where
to put that comma,

00:16:22.450 --> 00:16:26.170
because he would be marking
it with his red wax pencil.

00:16:26.170 --> 00:16:29.250
And he read my little piece,
and he talked about it.

00:16:29.250 --> 00:16:34.300
And afterwards he said, "McDermott,
come down and see me after class."

00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:37.430
So I thought he was
going to say nonfiction.

00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:40.430
Either that or probably if it had
been the 21st Century he would have

00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:43.700
sent me for counseling.

00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:47.510
[Laughter] You did that?

00:16:47.510 --> 00:16:49.760
And what he said to me
when I came down, he said,

00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:51.870
"I have bad news for you, kid.

00:16:51.870 --> 00:16:55.130
You're a writer and
you'll never shake it."

00:16:55.130 --> 00:16:57.040
[Laughter]

00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:58.470
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: Were you
glad to get that news?

00:16:58.470 --> 00:16:59.770
&gt;&gt; Alice McDermott: Delighted.

00:16:59.770 --> 00:17:04.010
It was the sun came out,
and it was something.

00:17:04.010 --> 00:17:06.790
And I thought this is
what the best teachers do.

00:17:06.790 --> 00:17:10.820
I thought I've always known that,
and I would never have known

00:17:10.820 --> 00:17:12.300
that if he hadn't said that.

00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:14.780
Both things at the same time.

00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:16.080
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: You
know, you're a writer

00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:18.120
that you can tell you choose
your words very carefully.

00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:21.960
I mean we talked about
there's a tremendous restraint

00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:26.150
in your writing, which I admire
greatly because it does reveal some

00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:27.590
of the emotions we've
been talking about,

00:17:27.590 --> 00:17:29.390
some of the inner workings
that restrain.

00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:31.750
Somehow reveals something.

00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:36.750
But do you enjoy the process of
writing, or is it hard for you?

00:17:36.750 --> 00:17:38.050
&gt;&gt; Alice McDermott: Both.

00:17:38.050 --> 00:17:43.810
It's difficult and it's
wonderful because it's difficult.

00:17:43.810 --> 00:17:50.130
I think I've learned at this
point, this is my eighth novel,

00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:54.550
that the best thing about
this crazy profession

00:17:54.550 --> 00:17:58.860
and Dr. Breon [assumed spelling]
sent me off on are those moments

00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:03.130
when you're working on a sentence.

00:18:03.130 --> 00:18:07.600
When it's not right and you're
turning it around and crossing it

00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:10.510
out and writing it again.

00:18:10.510 --> 00:18:14.390
And then you hear it.

00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:17.650
And you say, okay, not
that that's perfect.

00:18:17.650 --> 00:18:22.650
I've not felt that yet, but that
sentence is good enough for me

00:18:22.650 --> 00:18:24.190
to go on and write the next.

00:18:24.190 --> 00:18:28.020
Or that scene, that's
probably not perfect

00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:30.560
but I think it's probably
the best scene I can write

00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:33.640
at this point for this novel.

00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:37.350
And that's tremendously satisfying.

00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:42.660
And everything else after that
is either hot or cold gravy,

00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:48.760
but it's aside from
that great privilege.

00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:53.040
I mean, in this we
writers have readers

00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:56.160
to be internally grateful for.

00:18:56.160 --> 00:19:00.570
This thing you must do,
which is somehow organize

00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:04.460
or reorganize the world
through the gift of language.

00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:08.190
You're going to do it whether
anybody reads it or not.

00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:10.030
And, oh, it's so nice
that somebody does.

00:19:10.030 --> 00:19:15.170
And so to have that privilege to
spend your hours pursuing the thing

00:19:15.170 --> 00:19:20.900
that you know you must
pursue is a great privilege.

00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:23.210
And that still tickles me.

00:19:23.210 --> 00:19:26.020
I still think I'm a writer.

00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:27.320
Oh, my God!

00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:28.620
[Laughter]

00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:33.410 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: So to go back to this
book and to a lot of your books,

00:19:33.410 --> 00:19:37.400
you do write often about
Irish-Catholics in America.

00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:38.700
&gt;&gt; Alice McDermott: Yes.

00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:41.490
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: Why do you keep
returning to that subject?

00:19:41.490 --> 00:19:44.810
&gt;&gt; Alice McDermott: I think
it's probably more Catholicism

00:19:44.810 --> 00:19:49.200
that draws me than the Irish.

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:51.780
They just deliver.

00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:59.020
[Laughter] But I think
that the questions.

00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:03.210
As a cradle Catholic,
I was taught to ask.

00:20:03.210 --> 00:20:06.230
I'm still asking.

00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:09.270
And, you know, especially
in this book.

00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:15.210
In this book in particular,
that what is a sacrifice worth.

00:20:15.210 --> 00:20:21.360 position:56%
And as I say, being slowly realizing
I'm writing about substitutes.

00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:27.340
I'm writing about someone
putting his or her own life ahead

00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:31.330
in the way to protect another.

00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:34.060
What's the value of that?

00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:36.010
Why do we do that?

00:20:36.010 --> 00:20:39.060
What's the impulse to do it?

00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:41.920 position:56%
Are they selfish impulses sometimes?

00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:45.430
And I found myself,
of course, you know,

00:20:45.430 --> 00:20:50.900
going back to the greatest
story ever told and thinking

00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:55.570
about the ninth hour is
the hour that Christ dies.

00:20:55.570 --> 00:20:59.970
It's 3:00 in the liturgy
of the hours.

00:20:59.970 --> 00:21:05.550
And thinking about that
moment when Christ dies

00:21:05.550 --> 00:21:07.490
on the cross, this sacrifice.

00:21:07.490 --> 00:21:11.100
This substitute, if you will.

00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:13.340
And what was that like?

00:21:13.340 --> 00:21:18.500
The stillness in the moment
after death when believers

00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:24.630
and nonbelievers alike must
have been holding their breath.

00:21:24.630 --> 00:21:26.340
Were we right?

00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:27.640
Was he right?

00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:32.140
Was this worth it or was it not?

00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:34.860
Was it just blood?

00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:38.890
Just another life gone?

00:21:38.890 --> 00:21:42.340
And quickly after that,
I also thought, you know,

00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:45.310
just before Christ dies
he says to the good thief,

00:21:45.310 --> 00:21:48.150
you know, I'll see you in heaven.

00:21:48.150 --> 00:21:50.380
You'll be with me in heaven.

00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:53.410
And I thought what if
he didn't believe that

00:21:53.410 --> 00:21:57.290
and still made the sacrifice.

00:21:57.290 --> 00:22:01.540
And then I thought who would
make a sacrifice like that,

00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:04.200
not believing there would
be some reward for it?

00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:06.510
And my answer was women.

00:22:06.510 --> 00:22:10.390
[ Applause ]

00:22:10.390 --> 00:22:14.360
So suddenly I realized
this is what I need

00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:16.970
to get after about these nuns.

00:22:16.970 --> 00:22:26.780 position:56%
There's got to be a nun among them
whose sacrifice will entail the loss

00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:31.070
of the promise of the reward
and still she makes it.

00:22:31.070 --> 00:22:33.560
So I've got a character
who one ups Jesus Christ.

00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:34.860
I'm just telling you.

00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:36.380
[ Laughter ]

00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:37.760
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: And her
name is Sister Jean?

00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:39.220
&gt;&gt; Alice McDermott: And
her name is Sister Jean.

00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:40.540
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: And
Sister Jean is the kind

00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:42.410
of nun that everybody loved.

00:22:42.410 --> 00:22:43.920
Because there was a lot of
different kinds of nuns.

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:45.540
Some you really didn't like.

00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:47.280
And, you know, you've
got some in there.

00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:48.580
&gt;&gt; Alice McDermott: Sure.

00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:49.880
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: She was
one of the kind you loved.

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:53.330 position:56%
Everybody immediately thought Sister
Mary Immaculata, great teacher.

00:22:53.330 --> 00:22:58.710
She's just this wonderful nun
and plays a big role in the big.

00:22:58.710 --> 00:23:03.520
And she does something which she
thinks means she's going to go

00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:06.950
to hell, but it's really
an act of love.

00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:08.680
How can it be both?

00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:10.430
&gt;&gt; Alice McDermott: That's
the question, isn't it?

00:23:10.430 --> 00:23:11.730
Yes. Yeah.

00:23:11.730 --> 00:23:14.400
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: You're going
to answer it; aren't you?

00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:15.910
&gt;&gt; Alice McDermott: Well,
again it's that moment

00:23:15.910 --> 00:23:19.540
of stillness, of holding
your breath.

00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:23.440
For believers it's
a tremendous loss.

00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:27.360
Her sacrifice means that
she loses the promise

00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:30.500
that Christ himself
made to the good thief.

00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:34.820
For the nonbeliever, she has

00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:39.540
to facilitated a wonderful
life for many people.

00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:41.870
But she believes she has loss,

00:23:41.870 --> 00:23:45.550
that she's condemned,
and she accepts that.

00:23:45.550 --> 00:23:46.850
Yeah.

00:23:46.850 --> 00:23:48.510
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: Another
aspect of Catholicism

00:23:48.510 --> 00:23:53.330
that you explore here is Sally, the
girl whose life we sort of follow

00:23:53.330 --> 00:23:56.110 position:56%
through the book, who is brought up.

00:23:56.110 --> 00:23:58.520
Her mother worked in the
basement of the convent.

00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:00.680
So she's brought up
surrounded by the nuns.

00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:05.240
Inevitably wants to become a nun,
which was a pretty typical thing

00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:11.530 position:56%
for many young girls who were raised
in Catholicism at a certain time,

00:24:11.530 --> 00:24:15.030
but can't go through with it.

00:24:15.030 --> 00:24:16.330
&gt;&gt; Alice McDermott: Yeah.

00:24:16.330 --> 00:24:20.920
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: And that sort of, I
guess, loss of faith or inability

00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:24.780
to follow through on whatever you
think your great intentions are,

00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:28.430
that's also something
you looked at here.

00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:31.410
&gt;&gt; Alice McDermott: Yeah, well,
most of the scenes in the convent.

00:24:31.410 --> 00:24:35.360
And again I sort of want to
apologize for all the nuns

00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:38.510
in this novel and all the
laundry in this novel.

00:24:38.510 --> 00:24:43.290
Most of the scenes in the convent
take place in the basement laundry,

00:24:43.290 --> 00:24:49.660
which is where Annie, the widow,
works with one of the meaner nuns.

00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:53.540
Or she's annoying.

00:24:53.540 --> 00:24:55.890
She can be annoying.

00:24:55.890 --> 00:25:00.760
So for Sally, her daughter,
she's raised, there's a cradle

00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:05.050
in the basement where
her mother places her.

00:25:05.050 --> 00:25:08.420
And she really grows
up in the basement

00:25:08.420 --> 00:25:10.980
where they're washing
the nuns clothes.

00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:13.950
They're washing menstrual
rags at this time.

00:25:13.950 --> 00:25:17.420
They're washing the bedding
of the sick and the poor,

00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:22.180 position:56%
that the nuns bring back from the
places where they do their casework.

00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:27.360
So she doesn't have a sense of
what the nuns are doing out there

00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:31.220
in the real world, but
she loves the costuming.

00:25:31.220 --> 00:25:33.370
And that's really her vocation,

00:25:33.370 --> 00:25:39.230
is all about wearing those
sweet smelling neat clothes.

00:25:39.230 --> 00:25:40.940
Her vocation is very brief.

00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:44.410
It's pretty much one night.

00:25:44.410 --> 00:25:46.800
[Laugher] She takes the train
from New York to Chicago

00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:50.260
to join an eviscerate in Chicago.

00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:56.220 position:56%
And on the train are real people,
like dirty people who she's supposed

00:25:56.220 --> 00:25:57.520
to be giving her life to.

00:25:57.520 --> 00:26:01.240
And they're all awful and
they're mean, and they're snoring

00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:05.690
and they're eating smelly
food, and the train is noisy.

00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:09.710
And so by the time she arrives
in the morning at Chicago,

00:26:09.710 --> 00:26:14.990
it's like no way I want to spend my
life taking care of these people.

00:26:14.990 --> 00:26:18.920
So it's a very short
lived and romantic view

00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:21.190
of what the nun's life might be.

00:26:21.190 --> 00:26:23.060
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: Did you
ever want to be a nun?

00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:24.600
&gt;&gt; Alice McDermott:
I don't think so.

00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:28.900
I don't think so, although
I had wonderful sweet nuns

00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:32.050
who I admired tremendously
growing up.

00:26:32.050 --> 00:26:38.700
And there was always that sense of
these were the working women that,

00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:42.030
in my generation, we
got to see every day.

00:26:42.030 --> 00:26:44.090
All the mothers were home.

00:26:44.090 --> 00:26:50.000
But the working women, the
professional women were the nuns.

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:53.130
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: One thing I wondered
about too, in terms of your writing

00:26:53.130 --> 00:26:56.120
about Irish-Catholics in New
York is you're really writing

00:26:56.120 --> 00:26:57.530
about the past.

00:26:57.530 --> 00:26:59.500
You're really writing
about, in a sense,

00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:01.790
your parents' generation
to some degree.

00:27:01.790 --> 00:27:07.090
In some of your books you deal
with the children, our generation.

00:27:07.090 --> 00:27:09.830
And I wonder what's left of that.

00:27:09.830 --> 00:27:11.520
What is left of the Irish?

00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:14.100
How much is left of it?

00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:16.590
&gt;&gt; Alice McDermott: I don't know.

00:27:16.590 --> 00:27:19.760
I suppose there are still
pockets here and there.

00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:26.820
Every time I go to Ireland, I'm
shocked to realize how Irish I am

00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:28.550
and how Irish my family was.

00:27:28.550 --> 00:27:30.750
I thought we were New
Yorkers, you know.

00:27:30.750 --> 00:27:34.110
When I grew up, everybody's
grandparents were from Italy,

00:27:34.110 --> 00:27:39.640
Poland, Russia, Ireland, Scotland.

00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:45.330
And I'm surprised to see
that there are these aspects

00:27:45.330 --> 00:27:48.790
of our DNA that are similar.

00:27:48.790 --> 00:27:53.550
But in this book especially, for
me it's not a matter of trying

00:27:53.550 --> 00:27:56.550
to recapture a lost past.

00:27:56.550 --> 00:28:01.370
In this book particularly I
wanted to look through the eyes.

00:28:01.370 --> 00:28:04.220
And actually it's a kind
of collective narrator here

00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:09.040
that is looking back
through three generations

00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:15.320
and recreate the past more
vividly than the contemporary world

00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:16.980
from which the past is viewed.

00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:21.160
Because for me, that's
a parallel to faith.

00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:26.600
To be faithful is to
have a sense of a past.

00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:32.660
The moment on the cross, that is
as vivid or perhaps even more vivid

00:28:32.660 --> 00:28:35.420
than the life you're leading now.

00:28:35.420 --> 00:28:39.550
So in this book, in
particular, it was not so much

00:28:39.550 --> 00:28:44.560
to remember what it was like
in 1920 in good old Brooklyn.

00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:48.690
I don't really care what it was
like in 1920 in good old Brooklyn.

00:28:48.690 --> 00:28:56.890
But to have a kind of belief
in a vision of a world

00:28:56.890 --> 00:29:06.320
that supercedes our confidence in
our daily physical world right now.

00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:08.290
So I'm not interested.

00:29:08.290 --> 00:29:11.470
I don't think of this
as a historical novel.

00:29:11.470 --> 00:29:13.070
Yeah, sure, I had to
do some research,

00:29:13.070 --> 00:29:15.720
but research is just fun, you know.

00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:19.660
But I don't think this at all
as an attempt to recapture.

00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:24.410
I think of it more
as a parable perhaps.

00:29:24.410 --> 00:29:25.710
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: A parable?

00:29:25.710 --> 00:29:27.840
&gt;&gt; Alice McDermott: A
parable or, you know,

00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:34.530
an invitation to consider
the ideas that these people

00:29:34.530 --> 00:29:37.510
in the past were living by

00:29:37.510 --> 00:29:42.800
and how vividly we can
understand and recreate them.

00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:46.130
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: I think I want
to open the floor for questions.

00:29:46.130 --> 00:29:48.750
I'm not quite sure if
the mics are up yet.

00:29:48.750 --> 00:29:52.120
Are they? I can't really see.

00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:53.420
So go ahead.

00:29:53.420 --> 00:29:54.720
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon.

00:29:54.720 --> 00:30:01.580
When I was hearing you talking
about the spareness of the care

00:30:01.580 --> 00:30:06.290
with which you create the
emotions, so that there's the room

00:30:06.290 --> 00:30:08.630
around them, I started
thinking about white space.

00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:16.030
And the whole notion of a printed
page inside the margins has very

00:30:16.030 --> 00:30:18.010
little white space.

00:30:18.010 --> 00:30:21.630
But I assume what you're trying
to do is creating a space

00:30:21.630 --> 00:30:24.260
that somebody will stop at the
end of that sentence or the end

00:30:24.260 --> 00:30:28.570
of that paragraph and just
sort of think it through.

00:30:28.570 --> 00:30:31.280
How do you create the white space?

00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:32.580
&gt;&gt; Alice McDermott: Ha, ha.

00:30:32.580 --> 00:30:33.880
Thank you.

00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:38.280
Your hope only the best
readers stop and think.

00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:40.140 position:56%
We can only hope for a few of those.

00:30:40.140 --> 00:30:41.440
But thank you, if you do.

00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:45.460
You know, there's a great story

00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:48.680
by Issac Dennison called
The Blank Page,

00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:51.760
and it's really a story
about storytelling.

00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:56.810
And she says, or the
storyteller in that story says

00:30:56.810 --> 00:31:02.190
that if the storyteller is true
to the story, then the silence

00:31:02.190 --> 00:31:07.210
at the end of the story will
speak louder than any of the words

00:31:07.210 --> 00:31:10.280
that were used to tell the story.

00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:13.410
If the silence at the end
of the story doesn't speak,

00:31:13.410 --> 00:31:17.210
then the storyteller has
not been true to her story.

00:31:17.210 --> 00:31:21.880
So I don't think of it
as, gee, how am I going

00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:23.980
to get the reader to pause here.

00:31:23.980 --> 00:31:29.770
I think of it was just a relentless
attempt to tell the story,

00:31:29.770 --> 00:31:33.770
to be true to the story,
not to manipulate the story,

00:31:33.770 --> 00:31:39.490
not to pass the story through a
kind of presentism, will it be okay

00:31:39.490 --> 00:31:43.060
if I point this out, or even
pass it through your own work.

00:31:43.060 --> 00:31:45.180
Oh, my God, here I am
writing about Catholics again.

00:31:45.180 --> 00:31:47.090
Maybe I shouldn't do this.

00:31:47.090 --> 00:31:50.050
Maybe I should go back
to the Civil War.

00:31:50.050 --> 00:31:52.990
All that you put aside,
and it's a sort

00:31:52.990 --> 00:32:00.430 position:56%
of relentless determined attempt to
see the world that you're recreating

00:32:00.430 --> 00:32:04.320
and to be true to the
characters within it.

00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:08.520
And then you hope that the silence
at the end of the story will speak.

00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:11.510
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.

00:32:11.510 --> 00:32:13.090
Go ahead.

00:32:13.090 --> 00:32:17.060
&gt;&gt; Hi. I just finished
reading After This.

00:32:17.060 --> 00:32:22.180
And my parents and I and a lot
of people were in that book,

00:32:22.180 --> 00:32:24.510
and it was tremendous to read that.

00:32:24.510 --> 00:32:25.810
&gt;&gt; Alice McDermott: Thank you.

00:32:25.810 --> 00:32:29.980
&gt;&gt; A passage, and I don't
remember the exact words.

00:32:29.980 --> 00:32:32.380
So help me out here.

00:32:32.380 --> 00:32:35.770
John Keene mentions.

00:32:35.770 --> 00:32:38.910
And this is the part of
you that I love so much.

00:32:38.910 --> 00:32:43.760
He just a little short remark
about how his children,

00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:47.870
I believe you wrote,
feel like stones.

00:32:47.870 --> 00:32:54.420
And I almost fell out of my chair
when I read that, because revealing

00:32:54.420 --> 00:32:59.510
that was just amazing for that
character and for those of us

00:32:59.510 --> 00:33:03.820
that feel that way or know
somebody who probably did.

00:33:03.820 --> 00:33:06.960
And I'm going to sit down
as soon as I ask you this,

00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:10.150
because I don't want anyone
to remember what I look

00:33:10.150 --> 00:33:13.310
like and think I'm weird.

00:33:13.310 --> 00:33:14.610
The title.

00:33:14.610 --> 00:33:17.430
I need you to help me out.

00:33:17.430 --> 00:33:18.730
&gt;&gt; Alice McDermott: After This?

00:33:18.730 --> 00:33:23.360
&gt;&gt; Understanding where
that came from.

00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:24.660
[Laughter]

00:33:24.660 --> 00:33:26.280
&gt;&gt; Alice McDermott: I got to haul
out the whole Catholic thing again.

00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:32.550
So I apologize to those
of you who are bored.

00:33:32.550 --> 00:33:37.380
There's a prayer called The Solve
Regina in the Catholic tradition.

00:33:37.380 --> 00:33:42.210
And one of the lines, I
guess you can call it a line.

00:33:42.210 --> 00:33:47.570
I think of it as poetry,
is, "After this, our exile,

00:33:47.570 --> 00:33:51.910
show unto us the blessed
fruit of thy womb."

00:33:51.910 --> 00:33:54.510
So it's our exile.

00:33:54.510 --> 00:34:01.630
After this, our exile, show unto
us the blessed fruit of thy womb.

00:34:01.630 --> 00:34:04.960
So that's a novel that's
sort of paused as well,

00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:12.060
in that maybe similarly in
that waiting period to find

00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:19.520
out is faith justified or
should it be disposed of.

00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:26.570
&gt;&gt; Well, first of all I want to say
that I find your writing to be lush

00:34:26.570 --> 00:34:30.290
and not restrained,
and that I feel often

00:34:30.290 --> 00:34:34.950
as if the words are just
tumbling out and very emotional.

00:34:34.950 --> 00:34:38.660
But my question is
about the writing today.

00:34:38.660 --> 00:34:42.660
It feels as if I read an
inordinate number of reviews

00:34:42.660 --> 00:34:46.700
of apocalyptic and dystopian books.

00:34:46.700 --> 00:34:50.100
And can you tell us a little
bit about what you're finding

00:34:50.100 --> 00:34:52.440
in the writing of your students?

00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:54.980
&gt;&gt; Alice McDermott: Ah, thank you.

00:34:54.980 --> 00:34:56.280
Very interesting.

00:34:56.280 --> 00:34:58.620
Yes, there are a lot
of books like that.

00:34:58.620 --> 00:35:05.060
And maybe there's good
reason for it.

00:35:05.060 --> 00:35:08.410
To be honest, I don't see it
as much in my young writers.

00:35:08.410 --> 00:35:11.730
Maybe these are the
people who drift toward me

00:35:11.730 --> 00:35:14.240
when they're looking for a mentor.

00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:16.880
I see great variety.

00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:22.000
I see tremendous emotional depth.

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:25.980
And, you know, in some ways
maybe this is counterintuitive.

00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:28.730
I think about my students,
my MFA students now

00:35:28.730 --> 00:35:31.090
in their late 20s, early 30s.

00:35:31.090 --> 00:35:33.090
They're all so bright.

00:35:33.090 --> 00:35:36.750
And they are talented
in so many ways.

00:35:36.750 --> 00:35:38.670
And I know what their
GRE scores are.

00:35:38.670 --> 00:35:40.510
So I know they could
go to law school

00:35:40.510 --> 00:35:43.180
or medical school, or get MBAs.

00:35:43.180 --> 00:35:47.250
And in the 21st Century,
they want to be poets

00:35:47.250 --> 00:35:50.620
and writers of literary fiction.

00:35:50.620 --> 00:35:53.200
I am amazed by that.

00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:56.190
You know, when I was coming
up, we didn't know any better.

00:35:56.190 --> 00:35:58.390
We thought, yeah, you can
all be Virginia Wolfe.

00:35:58.390 --> 00:36:01.220
There's plenty of room for
Virginia Wolfes in the world.

00:36:01.220 --> 00:36:07.450
They know that's not true, and
yet this is what they choose to do

00:36:07.450 --> 00:36:11.880
because they love language, because
they're readers who want to do.

00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:14.240
Thomas Lynch calls it a
little bit of karaoke,

00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:17.980
when you're a reader
who becomes a writer.

00:36:17.980 --> 00:36:20.940
So I see tremendous sincerity

00:36:20.940 --> 00:36:24.630
and a tremendous effort
to say something real.

00:36:24.630 --> 00:36:30.920
Maybe that's why they're
not getting published.

00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:33.550
Maybe they should be more
on the surface of things.

00:36:33.550 --> 00:36:38.110
But I'm always very encouraged when
I read the work of young writers

00:36:38.110 --> 00:36:41.380
who I know will all be reading
in the next 20 years or so.

00:36:41.380 --> 00:36:45.180
So, yeah, dystopia
is fun and it's easy.

00:36:45.180 --> 00:36:49.000
You know, it's a big tent
for reading and writing.

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:51.850
We should welcome all voices.

00:36:51.850 --> 00:36:54.450
It's just nice we still have books.

00:36:54.450 --> 00:36:55.810
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: Have you
ever said to one of them,

00:36:55.810 --> 00:36:58.230
you're a writer kid and
you can't escape it?

00:36:58.230 --> 00:36:59.530
&gt;&gt; Alice McDermott: In many ways.

00:36:59.530 --> 00:37:00.830
In many ways.

00:37:00.830 --> 00:37:05.130
It's been very nice, and also
to know when you see the look

00:37:05.130 --> 00:37:09.620
on their faces when you
say, yeah, you're right.

00:37:09.620 --> 00:37:12.790
This thing that you want to do,
you're right to be pursuing it.

00:37:12.790 --> 00:37:15.710
And no one else in your
life may ever tell you that,

00:37:15.710 --> 00:37:18.020
but I'm telling you that.

00:37:18.020 --> 00:37:20.510
And, yeah, that's really.

00:37:20.510 --> 00:37:23.670
I haven't gotten any
nasty letters from them

00:37:23.670 --> 00:37:25.920
for ruining their lives yet.

00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:27.820
That may come.

00:37:27.820 --> 00:37:30.100
But it's a great opportunity.

00:37:30.100 --> 00:37:34.530
We all need that little push when
we're choosing something that is

00:37:34.530 --> 00:37:41.970
so against logic and sense, that
is the pursuit of any of the arts.

00:37:41.970 --> 00:37:43.270
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: Go ahead, sir.

00:37:43.270 --> 00:37:45.420
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I just want to
start by thanking you

00:37:45.420 --> 00:37:50.200 position:56%
for all these wonderful books you've
shared with us over the years.

00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:54.420
My specific question though,
comes from a comment you made.

00:37:54.420 --> 00:37:58.270
And that is you talk about
how meticulous you are

00:37:58.270 --> 00:38:01.690
when you create those
beautiful sentences.

00:38:01.690 --> 00:38:06.880
Having then finished that first
draft with that kind of effort,

00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:10.490
how much writing do you
feel actually gets done

00:38:10.490 --> 00:38:13.410
after that in your revisions?

00:38:13.410 --> 00:38:19.110
How complete is your novel at
the end of your first draft

00:38:19.110 --> 00:38:22.290 position:56%
as compared to the revision process?

00:38:22.290 --> 00:38:23.590
&gt;&gt; Alice McDermott: Thanks.

00:38:23.590 --> 00:38:26.650
Spoken like a writer.

00:38:26.650 --> 00:38:29.030
I never know what draft I'm on.

00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:30.770
I rewrite constantly.

00:38:30.770 --> 00:38:32.070
I rewrite every day.

00:38:32.070 --> 00:38:35.860
What I wrote the day before,
I rewrite before I add to it.

00:38:35.860 --> 00:38:39.190
So, I mean, I've heard writers and
I think, oh, they're so organized.

00:38:39.190 --> 00:38:42.260
Some day I'll be like this, you
know, print out their first drafts

00:38:42.260 --> 00:38:43.730
on yellow paper and then they print

00:38:43.730 --> 00:38:46.210
out their second drafts
on blue paper.

00:38:46.210 --> 00:38:49.490
I never know what draft I'm on.

00:38:49.490 --> 00:38:53.690
As a result, when I get to
the end I've been revising

00:38:53.690 --> 00:38:55.130
and revising and revising.

00:38:55.130 --> 00:39:00.800
So once I have the whole thing
before me, I don't do much revising

00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:05.240
because I'm revising
on and on and on.

00:39:05.240 --> 00:39:10.060
But I also talk about
the still moment.

00:39:10.060 --> 00:39:12.840
When something is finished,
I have no idea.

00:39:12.840 --> 00:39:14.990
I have absolutely no idea.

00:39:14.990 --> 00:39:17.300
I've been working with Jonathan
Glassy [assumed spelling],

00:39:17.300 --> 00:39:22.500
has been my editor since I
was 27 and I think he was 30.

00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:28.110
It's one of those rare long
marriages in publishing.

00:39:28.110 --> 00:39:33.950
And he had only seen the
first chapter of this book

00:39:33.950 --> 00:39:37.010
because it was published as
an excerpt in The New Yorker.

00:39:37.010 --> 00:39:38.630
He hadn't read anything else.

00:39:38.630 --> 00:39:41.460
And so I sent him the manuscript.

00:39:41.460 --> 00:39:44.650
It was just last December.

00:39:44.650 --> 00:39:46.230
And had no idea.

00:39:46.230 --> 00:39:48.220
I had no idea what I had.

00:39:48.220 --> 00:39:52.340
I had no idea if he was going
to call me and say, oh, nuns?

00:39:52.340 --> 00:39:53.640
Oh, Alice.

00:39:53.640 --> 00:39:58.710
[Laughter] Do you have
anything else?

00:39:58.710 --> 00:40:01.230
[Laughter] Which is why I always
work on two books at the same time.

00:40:01.230 --> 00:40:03.950
So I always have something else.

00:40:03.950 --> 00:40:08.180
[Laughter] And when he called
to say it was my reader

00:40:08.180 --> 00:40:15.130
and when he called
to say, I exhaled.

00:40:15.130 --> 00:40:17.260
And I said to him, honestly,

00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:21.800
if you had said toss this,
I would have done it.

00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:23.260
And he still doesn't believe me.

00:40:23.260 --> 00:40:25.200
He thinks I just say that.

00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:30.370
But so that's the disadvantage of
not knowing what draft you're on.

00:40:30.370 --> 00:40:33.280 position:56%
But for me it's that I have to hear.

00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:37.210
And I think a lot of it is
sound, and rhythm and sound.

00:40:37.210 --> 00:40:44.330
I have to hear the sentence,
the paragraph, the scene,

00:40:44.330 --> 00:40:49.270
the chapter before I know
how to balance the next.

00:40:49.270 --> 00:40:52.120
So for me it's a constant revision.

00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:53.420
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: Wait.

00:40:53.420 --> 00:40:56.050
Are you telling me that this is
what you sent to Jonathan Glassy

00:40:56.050 --> 00:40:57.600 position:56%
and you were willing to throw it out

00:40:57.600 --> 00:40:59.880
and you didn't change
it much since then?

00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:01.180
Wow.

00:41:01.180 --> 00:41:02.660
&gt;&gt; Alice McDermott:
Yeah, well, you know.

00:41:02.660 --> 00:41:03.960
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: You
didn't know what you had?

00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:05.260
&gt;&gt; Alice McDermott: I didn't know.

00:41:05.260 --> 00:41:06.560
You never know.

00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:07.860
Who knows?

00:41:07.860 --> 00:41:09.160
You know, who knows?

00:41:09.160 --> 00:41:10.460
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: Well,

00:41:10.460 --> 00:41:14.580
from interviewing writers I think
everybody approaches the work

00:41:14.580 --> 00:41:15.880
very differently.

00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:17.180
&gt;&gt; Alice McDermott: That's true.

00:41:17.180 --> 00:41:18.480
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: And there are
some who say I don't know

00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:21.410
where my book is going,
and I just follow it.

00:41:21.410 --> 00:41:24.100
And there are others who know
exactly where they want it to go.

00:41:24.100 --> 00:41:25.400
So I guess you're one of those.

00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:27.430
Do you follow your characters?

00:41:27.430 --> 00:41:30.180
&gt;&gt; Alice McDermott: With
this book I really was going

00:41:30.180 --> 00:41:33.110
to have one nun, and that was it.

00:41:33.110 --> 00:41:38.170
And then the nuns came
bursting through the door.

00:41:38.170 --> 00:41:39.940
[Laughter] They organized my life.

00:41:39.940 --> 00:41:41.240
They took over.

00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:44.750
They do exactly what they did
for the poor in Brooklyn in 1920.

00:41:44.750 --> 00:41:46.730
They clean things up.

00:41:46.730 --> 00:41:51.300
And they said this is not about
The Civil War, sweetheart.

00:41:51.300 --> 00:41:52.890
You don't want to write
about The Civil War.

00:41:52.890 --> 00:41:55.090
You want to write about us.

00:41:55.090 --> 00:41:56.900
And so there was that sense.

00:41:56.900 --> 00:42:03.710
And I hate to make this
sound, you know, too far out.

00:42:03.710 --> 00:42:05.010
This is just working.

00:42:05.010 --> 00:42:08.900
This is not like they came in and
sat on my desk and dictated to me.

00:42:08.900 --> 00:42:11.770
This is working through
lots and lots

00:42:11.770 --> 00:42:15.490
of scenes that did not feel right.

00:42:15.490 --> 00:42:18.460
I really did start out
with the contemporary story

00:42:18.460 --> 00:42:23.730
and have it turn all the way
around in the contemporary story.

00:42:23.730 --> 00:42:28.180
The substitute in The Civil
War does show up, but, oh,

00:42:28.180 --> 00:42:30.880
he has a very small roll.

00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:34.470
And in some ways there's
pleasure in that,

00:42:34.470 --> 00:42:37.120
because then you become
your own first reader.

00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:42.370 position:56%
You know, it's, gee, I wonder what's
going to happen today when you sit

00:42:42.370 --> 00:42:44.720
at your desk rather than,
oh, now I have to write

00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:46.770
that scene that's going
to be the underpinning

00:42:46.770 --> 00:42:49.500
for the explosion that's
going to bring us

00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:52.490
to the revelation that
he's the murderer.

00:42:52.490 --> 00:42:54.590
You know, what fun would that be?

00:42:54.590 --> 00:42:57.740
So but this in particular
was a book.

00:42:57.740 --> 00:43:01.090
This is why I had no
idea what I had,

00:43:01.090 --> 00:43:04.580
because it was not what I
started out to get hold of.

00:43:04.580 --> 00:43:07.140 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: How long did it take?

00:43:07.140 --> 00:43:08.440
&gt;&gt; Alice McDermott: Hard to say.

00:43:08.440 --> 00:43:09.810
This was a book that I was working

00:43:09.810 --> 00:43:14.590
on in one form while I was
working on Someone, my last.

00:43:14.590 --> 00:43:18.870
And as I say, it just
sort of switched around.

00:43:18.870 --> 00:43:23.110
It's been four years between books.

00:43:23.110 --> 00:43:27.300 position:56%
Probably I've been actually
working on this book seven or eight.

00:43:28.540 --> 00:43:29.840
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: Wow.

00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:31.140
I have one last question.

00:43:31.140 --> 00:43:33.370
We just have a couple of minutes,
unless somebody has a question.

00:43:33.370 --> 00:43:35.980
I just noticed during the course

00:43:35.980 --> 00:43:39.440
of our conversation you're a
little self-conscious about writing

00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:41.090
about nuns, writing
about Catholicism.

00:43:41.090 --> 00:43:42.390
&gt;&gt; Alice McDermott: Did you notice?

00:43:42.390 --> 00:43:43.690
Right.

00:43:43.690 --> 00:43:44.990
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: Everything
about the Irish.

00:43:44.990 --> 00:43:46.290
Just, why?

00:43:46.290 --> 00:43:47.590 position:56%
Because it's kind of worked for you.

00:43:47.590 --> 00:43:52.410
[Laughter] And you
do a good job of it.

00:43:52.410 --> 00:43:55.930
&gt;&gt; Alice McDermott: You
know, I guess I resist.

00:43:55.930 --> 00:43:57.710
You know, there's a
difference between.

00:43:57.710 --> 00:44:01.330
And this is true of literary
fiction, not all fiction.

00:44:01.330 --> 00:44:06.980 position:56%
There's a difference between what a
book is about and what a book means.

00:44:06.980 --> 00:44:12.440
And I think maybe just because
of promotional aspects of it,

00:44:12.440 --> 00:44:16.800
we don't talk enough about what
books mean, what the story means,

00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:22.410
why this story is being told, what
this story invites us to consider.

00:44:22.410 --> 00:44:27.460
I think we talk too much about
what's happening in the story.

00:44:27.460 --> 00:44:30.890
So not that it needs to
be a moral, you know,

00:44:30.890 --> 00:44:35.720
but you know when you tell a kid
a story about the Big Bad Wolf,

00:44:35.720 --> 00:44:38.160
they take it literally, you know.

00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:40.880 position:56%
It's like, well, where does he live?

00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:43.780
If I go there, is there
a wolf on our block?

00:44:43.780 --> 00:44:46.390
But as you get a little
older you understand, oh,

00:44:46.390 --> 00:44:51.120
you're telling me this because you
want me to think about what I say

00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:56.660 position:56%
and I shouldn't lie, and I shouldn't
make up over- emotional scenes.

00:44:56.660 --> 00:44:57.960
Oh, I understand.

00:44:57.960 --> 00:45:01.860
And I think somehow we've
gotten to be a reading public

00:45:01.860 --> 00:45:04.620
that talks an awful lot about
what happens in the book

00:45:04.620 --> 00:45:08.620
and who the characters are, and
who got killed when and why.

00:45:08.620 --> 00:45:11.210
And I think we don't
spend enough time.

00:45:11.210 --> 00:45:13.690
Book clubs do this,
which is why I love them.

00:45:13.690 --> 00:45:14.990
What do you think?

00:45:14.990 --> 00:45:16.970
Why do you think this
story's being told?

00:45:16.970 --> 00:45:19.890
Why do you think these
things happened?

00:45:19.890 --> 00:45:24.700
If every detail counts, which
I think it should in fiction

00:45:24.700 --> 00:45:27.170
because we're making
all this stuff up,

00:45:27.170 --> 00:45:32.520
every detail is a conscious
choice that a fiction writer makes

00:45:32.520 --> 00:45:35.200
to keep it, to put it on the page.

00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:37.960
And I love a reader who
looks at those details

00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:40.880
and says I wonder why
this is in here.

00:45:40.880 --> 00:45:43.930
I wonder what it means.

00:45:43.930 --> 00:45:45.230
&gt;&gt; Lynn Neary: Thank you
so much, Alice McDermott.

00:45:45.230 --> 00:45:47.030
&gt;&gt; Alice McDermott: Thank you.

00:45:47.030 --> 00:45:51.040
[ Applause ]

00:45:51.040 --> 00:45:54.360
