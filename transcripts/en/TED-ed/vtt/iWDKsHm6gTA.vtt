00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:09.722
In the biblical story 
of the Tower of Babel,

00:00:09.722 --> 00:00:12.566
all of humanity once spoke 
a single language

00:00:12.566 --> 00:00:14.818
until they suddenly split
into many groups

00:00:14.818 --> 00:00:16.973
unable to understand each other.

00:00:16.973 --> 00:00:20.526
We don't really know if 
such an original language ever existed,

00:00:20.526 --> 00:00:23.792
but we do know that the thousands 
of languages existing today

00:00:23.792 --> 00:00:27.021
can be traced back 
to a much smaller number.

00:00:27.021 --> 00:00:29.245
So how did we end up with so many?

00:00:29.245 --> 00:00:31.607
In the early days of human migration,

00:00:31.607 --> 00:00:33.652
the world was much less populated.

00:00:33.652 --> 00:00:36.621
Groups of people that shared
a single language and culture

00:00:36.621 --> 00:00:38.726
often split into smaller tribes,

00:00:38.726 --> 00:00:42.166
going separate ways in search 
of fresh game and fertile land.

00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:44.600
As they migrated and 
settled in new places,

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.611
they became isolated from one another

00:00:46.611 --> 00:00:48.652
and developed in different ways.

00:00:48.652 --> 00:00:50.475
Centuries of living 
in different conditions,

00:00:50.475 --> 00:00:51.569
eating different food

00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:53.482
and encountering different neighbors

00:00:53.482 --> 00:00:56.886
turned similar dialects with
varied pronunciation and vocabulary

00:00:56.886 --> 00:00:59.197
into radically different languages,

00:00:59.197 --> 00:01:02.912
continuing to divide as populations 
grew and spread out further.

00:01:02.912 --> 00:01:06.597
Like genealogists, modern linguists
try to map this process

00:01:06.597 --> 00:01:09.705
by tracing multiple languages 
back as far as they can

00:01:09.705 --> 00:01:12.651
to their common ancestor, 
or protolanguage.

00:01:12.651 --> 00:01:16.865
A group of all languages related 
in this way is called a language family,

00:01:16.865 --> 00:01:20.271
which can contain 
many branches and sub-families.

00:01:20.271 --> 00:01:24.416
So how do we determine whether 
languages are related in the first place?

00:01:24.416 --> 00:01:26.570
Similar sounding words don't tell us much.

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.862
They could be false cognates 
or just directly borrowed terms

00:01:29.862 --> 00:01:32.382
rather than derived from a common root.

00:01:32.382 --> 00:01:34.756
Grammar and syntax are 
a more reliable guide,

00:01:34.756 --> 00:01:36.463
as well as basic vocabulary,

00:01:36.463 --> 00:01:39.146
such as pronouns, 
numbers or kinship terms,

00:01:39.146 --> 00:01:41.504
that's less likely to be borrowed.

00:01:41.504 --> 00:01:43.790
By systematically comparing these features

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.346
and looking for regular
patterns of sound changes

00:01:46.346 --> 00:01:48.556
and correspondences between languages,

00:01:48.556 --> 00:01:50.501
linguists can determine relationships,

00:01:50.501 --> 00:01:52.718
trace specific steps in their evolution

00:01:52.718 --> 00:01:56.723
and even reconstruct earlier languages
with no written records.

00:01:56.723 --> 00:02:00.744
Linguistics can even reveal 
other important historical clues,

00:02:00.744 --> 00:02:04.683
such as determining the geographic origins 
and lifestyles of ancient peoples

00:02:04.683 --> 00:02:06.542
based on which of their words were native,

00:02:06.542 --> 00:02:08.761
and which were borrowed.

00:02:08.761 --> 00:02:10.724
There are two main problems linguists face

00:02:10.724 --> 00:02:13.049
when constructing 
these language family trees.

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:15.642
One is that there is 
no clear way of deciding

00:02:15.642 --> 00:02:17.505
where the branches 
at the bottom should end, that is,

00:02:17.505 --> 00:02:22.755
which dialects should be considered 
separate languages or vice versa.

00:02:22.755 --> 00:02:25.248
Chinese is classified as a single language,

00:02:25.248 --> 00:02:29.052
but its dialects vary to the point
of being mutually unintelligible,

00:02:29.052 --> 00:02:31.017
while speakers of Spanish and Portuguese

00:02:31.017 --> 00:02:32.885
can often understand each other.

00:02:32.885 --> 00:02:35.626
Languages actually spoken by living people

00:02:35.626 --> 00:02:38.041
do not exist in neatly divided categories,

00:02:38.041 --> 00:02:40.111
but tend to transition gradually,

00:02:40.111 --> 00:02:42.621
crossing borders and classifications.

00:02:42.621 --> 00:02:44.900
Often the difference between
languages and dialects

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.011
is a matter of changing political 
and national considerations,

00:02:48.011 --> 00:02:50.637
rather than any linguistic features.

00:02:50.637 --> 00:02:52.877
This is why the answer to, 
"How many languages are there?"

00:02:52.877 --> 00:02:56.026
can be anywhere between 3,000 and 8,000,

00:02:56.026 --> 00:02:58.080
depending on who's counting.

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.784
The other problem is that 
the farther we move back in time

00:03:00.784 --> 00:03:02.149
towards the top of the tree,

00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:05.445
the less evidence we have 
about the languages there.

00:03:05.445 --> 00:03:07.499
The current division 
of major language families

00:03:07.499 --> 00:03:10.675
represents the limit at which 
relationships can be established

00:03:10.675 --> 00:03:12.615
with reasonable certainty,

00:03:12.615 --> 00:03:14.194
meaning that languages 
of different families

00:03:14.194 --> 00:03:17.359
are presumed not to be related
on any level.

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:18.819
But this may change.

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:21.593
While many proposals 
for higher level relationships --

00:03:21.593 --> 00:03:23.706
or super families -- are speculative,

00:03:23.706 --> 00:03:25.436
some have been widely accepted

00:03:25.436 --> 00:03:27.015
and others are being considered,

00:03:27.015 --> 00:03:29.992
especially for native languages 
with small speaker populations

00:03:29.992 --> 00:03:32.432
that have not been extensively studied.

00:03:32.432 --> 00:03:35.293
We may never be able to determine 
how language came about,

00:03:35.293 --> 00:03:38.808
or whether all human languages 
did in fact have a common ancestor

00:03:38.808 --> 00:03:41.426
scattered through the babel of migration.

00:03:41.426 --> 00:03:44.158
But the next time you hear 
a foreign language, pay attention.

00:03:44.158 --> 00:03:46.571
It may not be as foreign as you think.
