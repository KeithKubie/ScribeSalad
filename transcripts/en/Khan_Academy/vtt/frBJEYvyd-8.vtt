00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.230
We're told to plot these values
on a number line.

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.700
And you see every one of
these values have an

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:08.290
absolute value sign.

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:11.020
So let's take a little bit of
a review of what absolute

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:12.300
value even is.

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.990
The way I think about
it, there's two ways

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:21.000
to think about it.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.200
The first way to think about
it is, how far is

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.270
something from 0?

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:28.340
So let me plot this
negative 3 here.

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:29.890
So let me do a number line.

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.170
This isn't the number line for
our actual answer, or to this

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.070
command-- plot these values
on a number line.

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.470
I'm just first going to plot
the numbers inside the

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:40.250
absolute value sign, and then
we're going to take the

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.790
absolute value and plot those,
just like they're

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:44.360
asking us to do.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.690
So on this number line, if this
is 0, if we go to the

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:49.440
negative, we're going to
go to the left of 0.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.680
So this is negative 1, negative
2, negative 3.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.880
Negative 3 sits right over
there, so this is negative 3

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.490
right there.

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:04.900
The absolute value of negative
3 is essentially saying, how

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.400
far are you away from 0?

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.590
How far is negative 3 from 0?

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.750
And you say, well, it's
1, 2, 3 away from 0.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.830
So you'd say that the absolute
value of negative 3 is equal

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.470
to positive 3.

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.490
Now that's really the conceptual
way to imagine

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:26.360
absolute value.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.240
How far are you away from 0?

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.110
But the easy way to calculate
absolute value signs, if you

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.480
don't care too much about the
concept, is whether it's

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.180
negative or positive, the
absolute value of it's always

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:41.180
going to be positive.

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.210
Absolute value of negative
3 is positive 3.

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.290
Absolute value of positive
3 is still positive 3.

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:49.880
So you're always going to get
the positive version of the

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:50.820
number, so to speak.

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.920
But conceptualy, you're just
saying how far away

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.330
are you from 0.

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:56.980
So let's do what they asked.

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:01.150
So that first value, on this
number line, so all of these

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:02.090
are absolute values.

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:03.750
So they're all going to
be positive values.

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.220
So they're all going to
be greater than 0.

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.320
So let me draw my number
line, like this.

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.789
I can do a straighter number
line than that.

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:11.500
Let's see.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.500
Well, that's a little
bit straighter.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.210
And let's say, if this is 0,
this would be negative 1, then

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:25.580
you'd have 1, 2,
3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:26.910
I think that'll do the trick.

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.150
So this first quantity here--
I'll do it in orange --the

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.930
absolute value of negative 3,
we just figured out, that is

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:34.765
positive 3.

00:02:34.765 --> 00:02:38.810
So I'll plot it right over
there, positive 3.

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.750
Then this next value, right
here, the absolute value of 7.

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.010
If we look over here,
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.760
7 is how far away from 0?

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.430
It is 7 away from 0.

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:58.830
So the absolute value
of 7 is equal to 7.

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.190
So you already see the
pattern there.

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:01.755
If it's negative, it just
becomes positive.

00:03:01.755 --> 00:03:05.020
If it's already positive,
it just equals itself.

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.270
So plotting this value,
I'll just place

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:10.170
it right over there.

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.830
So the absolute value
of 7 is 7.

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:16.510
Absolute value of negative
3 is positive 3.

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.170
Let me mark out the 0 a little
bit better, so you see

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.830
relative to 0.

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:29.620
Now we have the absolute
value of 8 minus 12.

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.670
Well, first of all, let's figure
out what 8 minus 12 is.

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:37.080
So if you take 12 away from
8, you're at negative 4.

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.050
12 less than 8 is negative 4.

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:44.530
And you can do that on a number
line if you don't quite

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:45.500
remember how to do this.

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.070
But if you, you know, if you
take 8 away from 8, you're at

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:51.310
0, and then you take another
one, you're at negative 1,

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.220
negative 2, negative 3, all
the way to negative 4.

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.580
So this is equal to the absolute
value of negative 4.

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:05.440
If we just plot negative 4, we
go 1, 2, 3, negative 4 is

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:06.550
right over there.

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:09.120
But if we're taking its absolute
value, we're saying

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.950
how far is negative 4 from 0?

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:13.910
Well it's 4 away from 0.

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:16.220
1, 2, 3, 4.

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.779
So this is equal
to positive 4.

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:20.100
So we'll plot it right here.

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.980
This number line is the answer
to this command up here.

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:29.240
So the absolute value of 8 minus
12, which is negative 4,

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.690
is positive 4.

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:34.960
Then we have the absolute
value of 0.

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:40.650
So how far is 0 from 0?

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:42.590
Well, it's 0 away from 0.

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:47.860
The absolute value of 0 is 0, so
you can just plot it right

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:48.780
over there.

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:49.960
And we have one left.

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.190
Let me pick a suitable
color here.

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:56.050
The absolute value
of 7 minus 2.

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:02.170
Well, 7 minus 2 is 5, so this
is the same thing as the

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:04.380
absolute value of 5.

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:06.655
How far is 5 away from 0?

00:05:06.655 --> 00:05:08.870
Well, it's just 5 away.

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:10.350
It's almost, you
know, too easy.

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:11.400
That's what makes
it confusing.

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:15.330
If I were to plot 5,
it's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:18.710
It is 1, 2, 3, 4,
5 spaces from 0.

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:21.310
So the absolute value
of 5 is 5.

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:24.420
So you plot it just like that.

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:27.300
So conceptually, it's how
far you are away from 0.

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:29.620
But if you think about it in
kind of just very simple

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:32.570
terms, if it's a negative
number, it becomes a positive

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:33.160
version of it.

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.710
If it's a positive number
already, it just equals itself

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:38.100
when you take the
absolute value.
