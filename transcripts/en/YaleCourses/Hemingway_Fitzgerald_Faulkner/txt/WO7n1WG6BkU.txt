Speaker 1:          00:10          Last time on Tuesday, we was talking about, um, the use of the word Nigger, uh, by various people. I'm in contact sometimes, uh, trying to be a true realizing, um, sometimes obviously agonized by trying to the do this guy's have fact. Uh, but uh, sometimes by one's neighbors, sometimes by oneself, but, um, always, uh, in the kind is nontrivial usage. Um, so today we're turning to the other side of the phenomenon and thinking about what it means to inhabit that adjective Negro, whether it means to embrace that as once identity. So, um, the, a list of Joel Christmas, part of the story of light in August, um, is really about what it means for somebody to choose to be black race. So it's very important to recognize that this is a volitional act, is a decision, active conscious decision. Um, but in that sense is also about someone poise.

Speaker 1:          01:18          Um, onto contrary possibilities don't Christmas could be either black or he could be like, so the either or a possibility is something that actually becomes quite important in American literature. The side of the farmer. So I just wanted to talk about one other word published, very close to like an honors plant, never last. And, um, as we can see now lost in herself in someone, uh, who could go either way. Um, it's just classified as, um, African American because of the one drop rule. So if you have the slightest bit of African American heritage of classified as black, so the black raider, um, but she, you know, really could be anything. Um, and in fact sheet there's no clear and after I'm in mid career, um, and just completely vanish from public and until she was fun there. And, um, there was a lot of the, is that actually as she was passing on those years, uh, when she disappeared and she wrote the novel, uh, calm housing about two black women, one Tuesday to be married to someone who is identified with, are black and the others using to pass as a white woman.

Speaker 1:          02:31          But I'm not succeeding at this, not being, uh, very happy with that decision. Um, so passing, um, this was publishing in putting us are very close to let an artist and um, in, as we can see from the book cover is really about the choice of someone who looks completely wait, who is classify as black, but who chooses to behave as a white person live the life of a white person. So, um, in fall, no in one way see is also a kind of passing. So let's not forget that Ashley is very much similar to the dynamics and Ella Lawson's passing. It is someone, a man who looks as white as the woman here who actually is initially classified as white but then chooses in spite of his outward appearance to embrace the life of black men. So it is passing into the opposite direction. It is self blackening or white person blackening himself.

Speaker 1:          03:47          There's no way you can, and there's interior, but at least he can try to black and black and his inside try to black and his emotions, his choice of companions and all the rest of it. So this is what Joe Christmas decides to do. Um, when he starts on this run down this long street that goes from the south to Chicago, um, to the north and analysts for 15 years, he was on this street. Um, and that's what happens to him when he's on this 15 year long street. He lived with me, Bruce shunning white people. He eat with them, slapped with them, belligerent, unpredictable, uncommunicative. He now lives as man and wife with a woman who is assembled and Emily coughing and they'd, he would lie in bed beside her sleepers beginning to breathe. Do you and how he would do it. Deliberately feeling even watching is what chess arched deeper and deeper within this room cage trying to breathe into himself, the dark order to dark and inscrutable thinking and being of Negroes with each sort of Spiration separation and trying to expel from himself the way blood and the way thinking and being and all the while his nostrils at the older, when she was trying to make his own with waiting and taught Watson is whole being arrive and the string with physical outreach as spiritual deny.

Speaker 1:          05:23          So this is an incredible in a status of self black. Some of the group doesn't have to be black to the, against every thing in him has sends us from our sense of sight and sense of touch. Everything again is everything in him. Even though every endothelium is revolving, again, it's being classified and as black and associating with blacks, that's what he chooses to do. So it was a very, very complicated, um, kind of psychology. Usually when somebody identifies with someone who's, they're not usually obviously identified with us because they believe like that identity, but in this case is absolute though than of being black and at the same time deciding to be black and stuff. So this is a much more complex psychology that we've seen in this novel. And I think to understand this, um, I think we need to borrow the terminology from someone who talks about what it costs double consciousness services.

Speaker 1:          06:31          Um, uh, W e B Dubois, um, um, very important thinker. I'm an activists from the 19th century to 20th. It's a bit 20th century. Um, and he wrote a book called the souls of black folk, which you as probably heard of, um, came up by the wall before light in August. And um, this is what he says about blacks. Let's not forget he's talking about blacks, people who love black. Um, this is what he's asked about the kind of complicated consciousness of the blacks have. It is the peculiar sensation, this double consciousness, this sense of always looking at oneself through the eyes of others, of measuring one. So by the tape of the world that those on in the news, content and pity when I'm with fuse is tumors and American, a Negro, two souls, two thoughts, two unreconciled strivings two warring ideas in one dark body.

Speaker 1:          07:38          So, um, this is this, keep looking at this person. A person who looks black has no choice but to inhabit this double consciousness, both to be aware of oneself as oneself, you know, having a completely internal relation to oneself, but at the same time having another views superimposed upon oneself because of the way other people are looking at you. So it is this doubleness one is looking at one through and supplies and then in voluntarily through the eyes of other people. But we shouldn't forget that in fact, Joe Christmas doesn't look like the black one. He looks like the male counterpart to this white looking woman. So is even more complicated than what two boys is suggesting. It's not the double consciousness of an obviously black man, but the double consciousness of a white looking person who even though he's really pow, but blackness nonetheless embraces blackbirds.

Speaker 1:          08:44          So it is just, you know, it's, it's, it's double consciousness redoubled um, in, in terms of this degree of complexity. Um, and today I like to talk about this kind of readable, double, double consciousness. The involvement, um, along three last January. One is obviously the importance of the light and shadow, which is advertised strong ties in the title. Um, the other is something that we've sort of been talking about, which is the relation between at a single individual and then the population of a group or motors here today. That's what I like to introduce. Um, and then something that we've been talking about. Um, all the way through about the question John [inaudible] and whether the, the dynamics between comedy and tragedy. Um, but let's start with also, um, given this, this configuration, um, I like to look at three characters, basically the two ends of the spectrum.

Speaker 1:          09:43          And then the point, um, I think that, you know, is to answer the spectrum would be would be Joel prisoners and Lehman Grove. Um, one tragic figure in the comic figure. Um, and between the two of them I like to put now the furthest they go with just the reverend hightower. Um, we've been talking about the revenant and hire talent in various contexts, but I like to bring him to bear now on the two obvious protagonists of light in August. Um, but first styling with Joe Christmas, um, like to talk about three moments, actually more than three, but three clusters and moments, um, uh, revolving around the APP. A striking match is so the, so obviously a pattern, the symbolic pattern, uh, revolving around that act that I think is really worth thinking about the three of them in sequence and in the interrelations. Um, so the first instance of strike, striking or manage is, um, is when he's contemplating, um, killing Joanna.

Speaker 1:          10:49          So Christmas lit the cigarette and snapped the match to what the open door watching the flame vanish in there. Then he was listening for the night trivial sound, which their match with me when they struck the floor. And then this theme to him that he heard it. Then his thing to him studying on the card in a dark room that he was hearing. And myriad sounds of no greater volume of voices, murmurs, whispers of trees, darkness of people, his own voice other than is evocative of names and times and places which he had been conscious of his life without knowing which worries life thinking God and me not knowing that too, he could see it like a blended sentence, foodborne and really debt. God loves me to let the feeling and whether my owners of last year's billboard, God, me too. So it isn't just an incredible acid.

Speaker 1:          12:03          Um, and I just want to say some obvious things about it and then come back to it. Um, but this, the striking of the match and then the dying out of the match. So literally the light dying up. But well there's also an interesting is that Ashley is the light guys out. Then it becomes a completely all the tree, um, moment. Um, is all about the sounds that come to, um, to Joe prisoners out of worries is, is he hears it, the light, the visual, um, tableau completely gives away to an arbitrary the soundscape bits of questions. Um, and then there's this weird kind of emergence of the kind of, um, his own theology. Right. You know, we've been talking about importance of Calvin, um, last time, um, and the play at the repetition of the name Calvin in light in August. Um, and hear this, this obvious and vocation of his relation to God and what it means to repeat that line.

Speaker 1:          13:06          Lanka, those me too. So just want to point out is obvious things, but uh, because this is the last class, um, I thought that, you know, would be good to, to bring back some other one. The other two others. So just to, um, the obvious detail, I've gone appearing on the bill of what we actually have seen exactly this before and the great gas bed. Um, and I said, God knows what you've been doing. Everything you've been doing this is, um, uh, um, make them, as I'm talking to George Wilson, Mattos a husband, I'm standing behind the, and you make a mistake with a shock that he was looking at the eyes of the after Tj at cover, which had just emerged pale and enormous from us and solving made. So as George Wilson at the moment, when he is on his starting out on this quest to kill the killer, what do you think the person who needs things kills is why?

Speaker 1:          14:06          Um, and pointing to this God on the billboard as the authority in that. Alrighty. Um, to justify his, the mission that's just beginning. Um, the, the other way in which fixture will also come into play. It's obvious later dinette links between the visual and the auditory. So this you talked about before about the essence voice for a moment, but last sunshine fell with romantic affection upon a gluing fares. Who've always compelled me. Four with breakfast. Lee as I listen, and a girl, the ish like discerning, heard with, lingering regret, my children leaving a pleasant street at that rate. So it's quality of voice. Describe in terms of the visual image. And finally the great Gatsby and the great self made man in American literature, but describe by Fitzgerald as a quasi religious stuff making. The truth was that Jay Gaspe of worst eight long island sprang from his platonic conception of himself.

Speaker 1:          15:11          He was a son of God, a phrase, which if it means anything, it means just that the, he must be about his father's business, the servers of a vast vulgar [inaudible] building. So he invented himself, just the sort of Jay Gatsby for the 17 year old boy would be likely to invent. And to this conception, he was faithful to it. Now. So it is very hard to ignore the central reality of religion in both the great Gatsby and, and light innocuous. Um, and the case of the great Gatsby. Um, the religious language is really used to underwrite the special kind of stuff making and what it means to be the son of God, um, in the 20th century and in the base of environment. Um, and that's the kind of some of making that, um, that, that their first was talking a relatively non racialized even though we're, that there's a little bit of race in the Great Gatsby as well.

Speaker 1:          16:14          So against that, that, uh, example of Fitzgerald, this is the one more time, um, at what farmer is doing with exactly that configuration, that billboard, the interplay between the visual and auditory and some in vocation of God. Um, it seems that when the light dies out, when we saw the only relation to life is by way of a death match, right? That meshed. And then if it hits the ground and then the light goes out completely and it's, that we get is all the sounds, then come to Dr. Smith and he becomes an involuntary strictly passive recipient of Sam's. I come to him and that really is the central function of Joel Christmas with Todd [inaudible]. We've talked before about how passive he is that his school as an actor, then a recipient of either the goodwill or in this case the ill will come in from other people.

Speaker 1:          17:21          Um, so he really is a blank slate, um, that on wish other people, the entire community, um, can write the collective signature. Um, he really is the bearer of, it's not a very good mellophone concerning that we're looking at and monitoring image, but just the switch to visual image briefly. Um, here's the bearer of the collectors, the nature of that community. So the transition from light to darkness in this moment and the transition from, uh, from the input coming into the eye and the [inaudible] ear is the increasing or the dramatized positivity of Joel prisoners. The, he's really completely a blind patient that everyone else writes the ds onto. But there's this further complication because this is a racialized landscape. It seems to give us a racialize version of a Calvinist theology that we talking about last time. So just wonder, think about what it means that, okay, the first item of size, um, costume, worst God perhaps been here, not doing that too.

Speaker 1:          18:42          And then God loves me to repeat it twice. It's almost as if the only thing George Christmas is true about is that God loves other people. That is an undisputed statement, right? So God loves other people, maybe got lost, everyone else, maybe he lost me too. So they can be more devastating. Um, self reflection or speculation about, uh, yourself is that every hour, everyone hours come before you. You basically you are an after thought and maybe not even an afterthought in gas mine. Um, and even if it is an after thought it was written on gas consciousness is written like this, those failure than weather leathers of last year's, they overboard, um, that you're that unimportant, that negligible to God. So it definitely is a, um, interesting, uh, racialized variation on predestination. So just, it's worth going back to Calvin for that reason and see why and actually who lands itself so readily to this particular negative kind of revitalization.

Speaker 1:          20:06          Uh, last time we talked about original sin. So, and so this is another very famous statement coming from Calvin on predestination. Um, and you know this nobody more up front than Calvin about predestination of what it means by eternal and immutable counsel. God has ones for or determine those who he would admit to salvation and those whom he would condemn to destruction to those who hate the Vost, to condemnation the gate of how the game of life is close by Justin. And we rent, rent, EU reprehensible, but in comprehensible Joshlynn. So the game of life is close by just, and you reprehensible in comprehensible judgment. There's no way you can quarrel with God is his decision. He decides that you are going to be condemned. Um, it doesn't make any sense to you. Basically, if you are the condemn, um, you can make any sense of it is completely incomprehensible.

Speaker 1:          21:20          But at the same time, if you'll Calvin is you also have to believe that it is a reprehensible, that God has every right to condemn you, even though it's from your point of view, it seems completely arbitrary. So that really is the meaning of predestination in particular interpretation of a rage, racialized context is that to be black is to be predestined in that particular ways. Always to comes that always to be an after thought and maybe even less than an afterthought in the mind of God. And that is what Joe Fritz was metaphorically as well as pragmatically chooses to give him his own sense of being so negligible in the world. Um, so you know, that that would be one interpretation of why he chooses to black and himself, even though he doesn't have to. Um, so this is thoughtless version of predestination itself. Black names of white looking man.

Speaker 1:          22:19          Um, it completely honors the logic of the gate, the flight being closed by just an you reprehensible, but incompetence, judgment and it's always under the shadow of race. So I would say that the pod of light in August that is associated with Joe Christmas, it's very much the regime of shadows. Um, and thoughtfulness. Bachelor, quite heavy handed about how often in, you know, the, we've said the original title I was nine in August was dog house. It can also be the shadows of augers because so much of the book is really about shadows. So, um, and the shadows tend to emerge, um, in the context of striking a match. So let's go onto the next moment. That's next episode of Joe Christmas striking [inaudible] turning on the, um, lighting aware. Um, this is the moment after the, the dialogue that we've looked at last time of Joanna offering to send him into a black to stand with a black lawyer and turning over our funds to him.

Speaker 1:          23:25          Um, and then the next thing that she asked him to do is to kneel with her and pray. So this is all in that context. Like the land. She said it won't need an invite. He said like the man, no, he said he's too for the bed. He held him razor in his head, but it was not open yet, but she did not speak again. And then his body seem to walk away from him if when to the table and his hands late, the racer on the table and found blam as match. So very heavy handed. An alienation of Joe Christmas from his bar, the rate, it's not jog Christmas that's doing the walking, his body seem to walk away from him. It's not Joe Christmas who was uh, laying the razor on the table as his hands that was doing it and his hands that is striking the right the lamb.

Speaker 1:          24:24          So it's just uh, the ash and kind of the strictly just from the front man of barley part and the consequence. So just highlighting the other passively of dog business themselves and serves individual front mounted bypass health agency but not dope business as a whole. Um, the consequence of the lighting this lab is this, this is what we see when the land is that um, he had today's see something else that casts a shadow on warp. It held an all star single action cap and ball revolver almost as long and heavier than the small rival. But the shadow of it and off her arm and hand on the wall did not waver at all. The shadow of both monsters, the car hammer, monstrous back haute and viciously boys like arch, head of the snake. It in that way for them. And their eyes do not waver.

Speaker 1:          25:26          Ally there were as still as the round black ring of the pistol muscle, there was no heat and no theory, but he was not watching them. He was watching the shadow pistol on the while. He was watching the cock shadow of her hand slipped away. I mean it's almost as if it's irrelevant, it's actually coming up. The most important thing is the play of that shadow on war. But we don't do know that the shadow is produced by that revolver. Um, but here we have actually the symmetry of weaponry. So geography is come fully equipped. He has the razor in his head even though, um, is not open and Joanna has to revolve and are ready and she thinks that is ready to go. And that's what Joe Christmas is seeing. So this is the outcome of that particular relationship that is completely under the shadow raised [inaudible] with and they are with Nivo or Negro League reliever.

Speaker 1:          26:29          Um, bad relationship is completely under the shadow of race. So this is actually the earliest moment which talks about race and it's a curse as an internal course, as the equivalent of predestination. But after that last thing, to see them for the first time novice people, but as a thing, a shadow in which I live with all white people or other people, I thought with all the children coming forever and never run into the wall white with a black shadow already falling upon them before they drew a graph. And I seem to see the black shadow in the shape of a cross. I'm not even going to read you the whole thing you guys remember, this message is very much the vocation, the black shadow as the modern incarnation of the Calvin, this doctrine of original sin and occurs the falls upon you, uh, before you were even born, before when you were a baby, before you've done anything, even before you won, when you're in your mother's womb, that shadow of Israeli fall into the party.

Speaker 1:          27:31          So it's a very, very extreme version of count. The carbon is the allergy and bright. Here. We also see it not only as theology but as dramatic action as the shadow of that historical, um, on the wall. And we now know the, the final, uh, moment of striking to Christmas striking badge. Um, then he paused and he struck a match and examine the pistol in the puny dying glare, the match burned. And whether they still seem to see the Asian thing with is too low. The chambers, the one upon which they have or haven't really fallen in, which had not exploded the other upon wish no hammer had fallen further behind, which I hammer had been planned for for her. And from the is that his arm came back and through your hurt the pistol crash once through the undergrowth, then there was no sound again for her.

Speaker 1:          28:35          And for me. So this is the basically the tragic and a Latin artist. There's no denying the importance of tragedy, uh, and is, uh, is, you know, it depends on how much weight we assigned to the job. Trismus and to put that in the section of the novel. Um, if we were to give primacy to that session, then the, the cemetery of weapon as the razor and the pistol, um, than the boat, the boat chambers loaded into pistol, that she really means, uh, for the two of them to die together. This is the appropriate for a tragic narrative, even though Christmas doesn't die from that. Uh, nonetheless, the stage is really sad for that particular tragic outcome. Um, so there's really not a whole lot more, you know, it couldn't be any other outcome. There could be no, no other ending, uh, for children's and Joanna, either one of them would have to die with the two of them would have to die.

Speaker 1:          29:44          Um, but there's really no other thought and can't really think of any other ending for the two of them. Um, so let's, but thank God they're not the only ones in light in August. So we're beginning to move, um, to somewhat to the other side was the other side of the spectrum. Um, and, uh, actually a very interesting transitional figure about someone who's at mid midpoint between Joe Prisoners and leader growth is high tower. Um, and um, the as the, the, the image of the light and shadow, um, and the kind of contest between light and shadow is also the visual landscape in which hightower is situated. Um, so this is the moment when baron bunch, um, and enjoy Christmas grandparents at this point we used to pay related, um, but, but basically Byron Bunch, um, go into hightower and begging him to tell a lie so that Joe Christmas can have an alibi.

Speaker 1:          30:47          So bar inside is really your word again as Joel grounds, if you would just say that he was with you that night, that will be better, stronger evidence than a, and then coming home from jail, Bruh. So high pug could have told a lie and the lynching would have happened, but this is what he does because now like how is shouting I won't do it. I won't. With his hands raised and clench his face when his lived through, lifted. The pan is cleansed and rotting teeth from about which the sagging of flabby and Publico Flash Fos away. Suddenly his voice rises high again. Get out of these screams, get out of my house, go my house. Now he falls forward onto the desk, his face between his expanded arms and his claimed. This fits as to two people moving ahead of him. Baron looks back from the door, he sees that hightower has not moved his ball head and has expanded and clenched fist of arms while I four in the pool of light from the shaded plan.

Speaker 1:          31:56          Um, so this particular visual image suggests that hightower's completely poise between Biden Shadow, um, this light, but it's coming from the shaded lab and he's given an opportunity actually to do something significant in well to have saved two Christmas. We'll have been a significant decrease in the life for some of you actually has not done a lot of significant things. Um, you know, does it very, his life could have been much more consequential. And in fact, it hasn't been all that consideration. So Sally, Joe Christmas would have been a consequential action. Um, but hide hell just cannot bring himself to do with all kinds of reasons. So we can speculate why he chooses not to do it, but that is the moment when his voice is very high as befitting his name, the high tower. But what the very highs voice is doing is turning away this opportunity.

Speaker 1:          32:58          I think all of us will have different decisions whether or not to lie that over. His decision is not alive and to allow the violence to erupt as everyone can see that it's about to. Um, but this is not the, so this is the moment when his sort of 'em in the satellite from the ship, poor machine, wham. But this, um, and another possibility for height, how that comes. Actually we five page after that. Um, so far that actually I will say is quite gentle towards high tower in terms of the final place, um, given to him, um, in the story in the novel. Um, so we know that once before hightower how tried with deliver the baby. Right? So like we have a black woman and he spit the doctors most common Dr Raj to banks who hide out the lose the baby and the baby is dead.

Speaker 1:          33:52          And then the rumors go around the town that the baby is his. So, so, uh, it turns out that he actually gets a second chance to deliver a baby. Of course we know whose baby it is, um, but he gets to deliver the baby because the doctor also arrived too late the second time. So the doctor arrived too late this time. Also, Byron had to wait for him to dress virals Santa fast adopter Barron than to wait for him to dress. He was an oldish man now and Farsi and somewhat disgruntled and having been awaken at this hour. Then he had to hunt for the switch key to his car or was your captain and a small metal strong box. The key to which in turn he could not find that once. So when they reached the cabin that lasts, the ease was primrose color and there was already handled this with some of summer and again, two men both older now met at the door of one room cabin.

Speaker 1:          34:52          The professional having lost that again to them too. First he enter the door to Dr. Hood, the infant. So it is crucial that this is a repetition. This is a replay of an earliest scenario. Fuckwit Amazon's is this over again, it's the second time growth too late this time also also and again, so it turns out that actually the second time around makes all the difference in the world because at this time high tower is evil to deliver the baby successfully. This is actually the consequential action that he manages to do that is granted him. He's not granted the, the on the, um, bravery or you know, I don't even know what word to use for if he had chosen to lie. He, he's not granting that whatever mental ability or mental Thomas, uh, to, to lie to life or for, um, for Joel Christmas. But he has ran or something that Ashley is both more uncontroversial and with an obviously the night outcome to delivery of a baby where the professional, the doctor is to like this time too.

Speaker 1:          36:13          So it turns out that Faulkner has given us not only, and that is why the double consciousness is we doubled or maybe we doubled again in late in August, is that there are two meanings to be in second, um, in Joe Christmases, usage, God loves me to be in second means that basically you and nobody that you are nothing that you'd council nothing at all. You're always going to be an afterthought for me too. Um, that's what being stabbed is, means losing out and maybe not even having the dignity of losing. I would just meaning being a non contender really, um, in a field where everyone else is going to be ahead of you. Being in that camp contender is what being sad and having the word to attach to you. Um, but that's not the only meaning of two or in a variation. Awesome. So the second time when we see that in the case of high tower to darker arrive to make this time also second actually means a second chance that you messed up the first time around.

Speaker 1:          37:31          You know, he didn't actually really wasn't so much messing up a meeting or some ladies are just born there. Um, but the, I is with some messing up, you know, it wasn't a completely satisfied, it wasn't, that's fine. Outcome wasn't acceptable outcome to most people. Um, so you messed up the first time around, you get a second chance to do it one more time. So being second, Ashley completely supports that sat in usage and that is why to my mind, um, hightower decision and put in mid point between Joe Christmas and the Grove, is that his athlete ticking on us, um, halfway, um, and the direction of a much more affirmative view of, you know, one as possible, um, much more further to the view of the world. Um, but it is important to recognize that this is actually a completely accidental development, right? There's no reason, no logical reason why the doctors should arrive too late.

Speaker 1:          38:40          And it's only because the doctor arrives two ways, then I targets to deliver the baby. The doctor arrives, two emphases. Oh wait to be working out in the middle of the night, can find it's key to the car. Um, all this accidental development, um, contribute to, and the doctors had told her, other than the fact that he's a at once before, he really is an absolute stranger to novel. He's such an original character. So third, second chance coming to tie tower comes to him by virtue of the pregnancy and childbirth of a total stranger in a row and the exit download weightness of another accidental person, the doctor. So we're beginning to get into, um, uh, an arena where is really not high towers action alone, but the combined action of all these other people, um, many of whom are strangers to him, it is the combined action of all these people that produce an outcome.

Speaker 1:          39:47          So this is a romantic interview. Some, um, theoretical speculation on this point and um, James, uh, through a Wiki is, I'm a staff writer for the New Yorker. Um, and he, while back, he wrote a book and you're not like that, but that thing five, 10 years ago wrote a book called the wisdom of crowds, which actually got a lot of attention when it came up. And his basic argument, um, is that, um, that the collective decision, uh, or, or just the collective, um, congenital, anyone when this is inflammation, the collective conjection collected guesswork, but abrogation of gases from a lot of people that aggregation is always going to be closer to the truth than the single gas was single individuals. So it's actually a kind of complicated mathematical argument is about aggregation of conjecture being better, having a much higher likelihood of being closer to the truth.

Speaker 1:          40:53          So it's, even though it doesn't talk about statistics, actually, it's very statistical and this is over thinking that is about chances and likelihood themselves. Um, the other book, um, that is also relevant and as it has the title, um, here is by Michael called and told me angry, um, is, um, burden you with a food substance. So that argument. But this one, um, I mean it's really not not about what we're talking about. There is one line, um, that is relevant to what we've been talking about. Um, which is about the thinking about what the meaning, um, now to two could have for them mounted to is the cooperators conversions of subjects only the Malibu to through its practical experimentation, we're off of the models and determine when and how the possible becomes the real. So it has some, um, has some resemblance to this road wiki argument, which is that it is about how the possible can they come to Rio.

Speaker 1:          42:01          And it turns out that the collective conjecture, that amplification of individual guesswork or individual, the aggregation of action from long people would put us in closer contact to how the possible can become too real. Um, so these are the two sort of can turn free, um, lines of thinking about Ruth and about human populations as opposed to human individuals as the Asians of history. Um, it turns out that actually there's also a 19th century precedent for a farmer. And we're so used to thinking of the scarlet letter as a combination, as the bigotry of puritans. But let's not forget actually the Hobsons if very important statement about now with you that brands completely countered or stereotypical vision of Paradise when, and I'm instructed mounted to attempts to see with his eyes, it is exceedingly apt to be deceived when, however iPhones this judgment as it usually does and the intuitions of this great and warm hot, the conclusions that attained often.

Speaker 1:          43:17          So proof and so airing as to possess the character truce supernaturally with you. Um, it's an astonishing statement from the scholars are saying that in fact that the great and warm hot is not the attribute of the single individual than in fact the human heart in his individual embodiment is likely to have lots and lots of shadows. And, and the only way that those shadows can be relatively to activated is when we think that the aggregate me, I think that's the really interesting theory. I'm just offering it to you as possible. Um, so, but I do think that this is what Farbman um, things in his, the use of tools, strangers, um, doctors, you know, people who have no relation to one another and live longer. So basically his notion often now the two is that this random isis statistical population though and this chance there.

Speaker 1:          44:21          Um, and this is the moment, and I think this is an extreme moment, um, in light in August when right before the killing, actually Joe Christmas, this essentially more it get, it's early, doesn't go with the deed that follows. But this is what's often gives us in the land and suspension of augers intuition nighters about two full income. It seems to engender as rounds out for thing or like a halo. The Halo is full of phases. The phases are not shame with suffering last shape with anything, not horror, pain or even reproach. They are peaceful as though they have escape and apotheosis is only is about them. So I don't need to talk anymore about that. Just that the halo is not the hill. I'm a single phase in this for our faces. Um, and it is, that's the reason why he goes right back to how you starts out talking about the kindness of strangers and there's kindness of strangers is not even our agonized by everything that has happened in between patient one of the light in August and the last page, the last pages of like the kindness of a stranger.

Speaker 1:          45:39          Yes. It has to recognize and take into account and fully and knowledge and put in the foreground the cruelty of one's neighbors. No question about it. It has to encompass all of that, but the kindness of strangers we means. And so he's totally happy to bring in personal never before mansion in, in August in the last pages of the novel, the lives in the eastern part of the state of Virginia repair. And do your who recently made a trip into Tennessee to guess an obese as a furniture which had bought by correspondence completely extraneous detail, um, at the end of the novel. And the reason this furniture dealer, um, is in the picture somewhere is that he is there to witness this ongoing courtship train being a growth and, uh, Barton bunch, so less see what farmer's things about marriage. Um, and it turns out that he actually has thought, given some thought to his rival, the relation between the two of them are not always, uh, relations with cordial.

Speaker 1:          46:48          Uh, so it goes right into [inaudible] it outright in any way. Poor bloke to have to marry three times to find, know that marriage is a failure. Apparently man can be cured of trucks, gambling, biting his nails and picking his nose, but not often narrate. This is what we're addicted to his marriage. It doesn't matter. And you know, you've failed thousand hundred, you still won't get married. So given the fact is totally cleared I evaluation of the outcome of marriage, Dawson, the fact that it's just going to be an ongoing addiction, um, we can maybe go, we should not be surprised by what comes to the end of Pflag Naugles. And I just want this, when you're talking about him in wintertime, remind you that we spend this kind of structured format with the structure, right. And they, um, the phone about those, he lay flat on the Brown pine needles, fall in the forest, his chin on his phone at arms beginning of the novel, and is awful. He could feel his heart beating against upon you, those little, the forest and being of light in August, probably at the beginning and ending beginning, although I have not been quite a month on the road, I'm ready in Mississippi and then offline, all those hail and then coming from Alabama for two months and now it's already Tennessee. So it is Lena [inaudible] candy on the kindness of strangers and county on the statistical side than to every Lucas Bush. There will always be a battery punch because marriage is an addiction. So that's one comment. Thank you very
