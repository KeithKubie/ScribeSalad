00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:05.750
You are listening to radiolab radio from W.

2
00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:09.990
N y. S. E. N. N. P. R.

3
00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:14.820
Okay. So you know, uh, the [inaudible] core of our job right,

4
00:00:14.821 --> 00:00:16.800
is to ask people questions, right? Yes.

5
00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.940
Then we sit there for hours and edit the answers. And I've noticed that, um,

6
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.630
the answers sometimes have a kind of musicality to them.

7
00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:29.850
Like sometimes you get this. That's right. No, right? Yes,

8
00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.590
no way. Right, right, right. Yes. Oh No,

9
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.600
I didn't know that. Those are the shot quick Staccato beats. Yes. Yes.

10
00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.350
This is like the sound of certainty, right?

11
00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.690
But there are times when you get a completely different music, you know,

12
00:00:51.691 --> 00:00:55.950
like say you're asking a hard question or a clarifying question,

13
00:00:55.951 --> 00:01:00.300
is it a or is it B? Then sometimes you get this,

14
00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.120
well, it certainly, let me just see. He,

15
00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.260
his, um, um, I mean, yeah, well,

16
00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:14.723
but I think

17
00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.510
you get this kind of melodic wavering. No, I, it's, I,

18
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:24.833
I,

19
00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.640
you know, in purely musical terms,

20
00:01:33.641 --> 00:01:35.440
the pitches and the first one are like pow, POW, pow.

21
00:01:35.441 --> 00:01:37.180
They're just precise and quick.

22
00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.570
But in that second category that pictures are floating up or floating down,

23
00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.780
they're never stable. You're not normal person. Really know what it's like.

24
00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.500
That's the sound of doubt. Doubt.

25
00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:52.140
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

26
00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.890
<v 0>you know, we could do, what's that? We have collected some stories,</v>

27
00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.780
which in a way they all have doubt in them that you have certainty in them and

28
00:02:01.781 --> 00:02:04.420
what they all are are, are kind of collisions. Really.

29
00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.420
We have three stories for you. Difficult, complex,

30
00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.090
emotionally wrenching situations,

31
00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.870
kind of situations you can't really walk away from and you can't resolve them.

32
00:02:13.871 --> 00:02:17.830
So you have to do something. And that's this show that's going to be our show.

33
00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:23.110
We should call it. Um, are you sure? No, no. H I don't know yet.

34
00:02:23.111 --> 00:02:26.320
I have to think about, that's what I'm suggesting as the name. Are you sure?

35
00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:32.040
Are you sure? Yes. Are you sure? He said,

36
00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:33.023
listen,

37
00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:38.010
I'm Jad Abumrad he's driving crullers his radio lab and to get something

38
00:02:38.011 --> 00:02:39.480
started. Are you sure? That's good.

39
00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.590
We start with a producer we've worked with for a very long time. Lulu Miller.

40
00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.870
Very interesting story, which takes many twists and turns.

41
00:02:45.871 --> 00:02:49.260
It begins actually with the fact that as a girl,

42
00:02:49.261 --> 00:02:52.610
Lulu really loved rocks. She just loved to sit on rock.

43
00:02:52.611 --> 00:02:54.990
She loved to think about rocks. She just liked rocks.

44
00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:00.020
They felt slightly animate in the way that a tree does or that an animal does

45
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.500
<v 2>that. I know it's not a human, um,</v>

46
00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.150
but it's a nice thing in the world that for whatever reason brings about a

47
00:03:07.151 --> 00:03:12.010
feeling of peace. Then one day, seventh grade, Mr Pricer, you science teacher,

48
00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:17.040
he did a lesson on inorganic versus organic matter and we make this huge list on

49
00:03:18.581 --> 00:03:23.410
the chalkboard organic matter trees. Yup. Thugs. Yup.

50
00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.060
Pasta shirt.

51
00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.480
It's kind of blowing our minds because it seems like everything's organic.

52
00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:29.740
A corpse was organic.

53
00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:34.770
Even a table is organic because wood used to be alive and then he had draws this

54
00:03:36.101 --> 00:03:41.101
like harsh white lined on the chalkboard and he writes in organic metal salt

55
00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.990
rocks and I was like, oh

56
00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:49.190
<v 0>no. I mean it sounds a little bit silly,</v>

57
00:03:49.191 --> 00:03:52.910
but this was actually a big deal for Lulu and she, even when she worked with us,

58
00:03:52.911 --> 00:03:57.740
she would talk about this. But then you fast forward many years.

59
00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:59.330
Actually when she was leaving the show,

60
00:03:59.331 --> 00:04:03.650
she decided to bike across the country from California to New York and she meets

61
00:04:03.651 --> 00:04:07.820
somebody who changes things for her and her rocks

62
00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:09.750
<v 2>and pretty much everything. Well,</v>

63
00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:14.780
I met him in the middle of possibly the loneliest place in the world.

64
00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.570
<v 3>It's called the loneliest road in America highway route 50.</v>

65
00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.840
And it's just a two lane road that crosses the state of Nevada desert desert

66
00:04:28.211 --> 00:04:31.720
desert. This is the sound of a busted bike,

67
00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.140
broke ins book, a rip tire,

68
00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:40.050
just desert stretches for a hundred miles at a time. Oh,

69
00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:45.250
<v 0>did you end up having to ride a hundred miles in one day down? Oh yeah.</v>

70
00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:50.500
Okay. So you're in the middle of this, uh, this expanse of dread.

71
00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:52.270
Yes. And what happens

72
00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.590
<v 2>finally, make it late in the afternoon to basically our end point for the day.</v>

73
00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:02.240
Little gas station with a little diner and we see out in front of the restaurant

74
00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:07.570
this bike that's like loaded down with so much gear and you're like,

75
00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:11.840
oh, fellow traveler. Yup. So we went in, picked him out immediately.

76
00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:14.960
She was the only other person in this kind of like biker bar,

77
00:05:14.961 --> 00:05:19.730
basically wearing Lycra. He's young. He was early twenties,

78
00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:23.840
big red beard. This young dude from Kentucky with a little drawl.

79
00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:29.300
His name is Jeff, Jeff, Jeff Vineyard. So his story was that he,

80
00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:34.280
um, he was about to be getting married and he was supposed to be doing this trip

81
00:05:34.281 --> 00:05:35.690
with his fiance, Megan,

82
00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:39.350
but at sort of at the last minute just due to wedding planning,

83
00:05:39.351 --> 00:05:43.160
logistics and all that. She had decided not to come on the trip, but you know,

84
00:05:43.161 --> 00:05:46.310
so he's doing it alone and just kind of thinking of it as a little bit of

85
00:05:46.311 --> 00:05:49.240
reflection time before he gets married. Um,

86
00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:52.910
he had just finished Grad school in geosciences,

87
00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:58.450
so geology and like tracking earth statistical data you have in the same

88
00:05:59.871 --> 00:06:00.950
direction that you guys were going.

89
00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:03.110
He was going our way to [inaudible] and he said, you know,

90
00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:06.320
oh look mind if I ride with you to the campsite. And we said sure.

91
00:06:06.321 --> 00:06:07.580
And then we ended up

92
00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:13.190
riding together for about 11 days. So you get to know him,

93
00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:17.600
really got to know him. This is us,

94
00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:20.890
<v 0>Nevada, well, hymns, you know, uh,</v>

95
00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:25.140
well that was a dod of amazing grains. Yeah. And that's him singing,

96
00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:31.970
uh, by or fear.

97
00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:37.740
<v 2>The other little part to tell you beforehand is just that Jeff grew up very</v>

98
00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:43.180
religious. GRANDPA was a preacher and his fiance,

99
00:06:43.181 --> 00:06:47.290
Megan, also very devout, very religious, has always felt the presence of God.

100
00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:51.330
<v 0>Yeah. Uh, [inaudible]</v>

101
00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:55.680
<v 2>did he actually met Megan through his church?</v>

102
00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:58.260
They met while doing mission work down in Louisiana.

103
00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:04.490
Can we go look at a rock really quick? Okay. So we meet this dude.

104
00:07:04.491 --> 00:07:05.390
He's a geologist.

105
00:07:05.391 --> 00:07:10.010
He sings all the time and about three or four days into riding together,

106
00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:15.170
he says something that completely changes my understanding of the world.

107
00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:16.580
Any clue what that is?

108
00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:18.950
<v 4>No. Can I get some water and rinse them off? Yep.</v>

109
00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:19.820
<v 2>Yeah. Okay.</v>

110
00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:24.380
We are pulled over to the side of the road in Utah and Jeff has us looking at

111
00:07:24.381 --> 00:07:27.730
some rock washing it off this,

112
00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:29.810
this might be a limestone.

113
00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:34.610
And then he just starts casually mentioning how limestone is formed.

114
00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:39.830
<v 4>So it's a sedimentary rock and it forms from what used to be the bottom of sea</v>

115
00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:44.550
force. What actually causes it to form, um,

116
00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:48.180
is there is plankton in the water and um,

117
00:07:48.181 --> 00:07:53.010
lots of these small organisms that have very, very, very small shells,

118
00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:54.790
you know, microscopic. Um,

119
00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:59.760
all that's left of these organisms after they die or they're small shells get

120
00:07:59.761 --> 00:08:03.480
deposited on the sea floor and then more shells get deposited over top of them.

121
00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:08.400
And then over the course of many, many years, you have these very,

122
00:08:08.401 --> 00:08:11.790
very thick, almost like drifts of, um,

123
00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:15.360
of these plankton shells. And then, you know,

124
00:08:15.361 --> 00:08:19.170
there's tremendous pressure at the bottom of the sea floor and they compress and

125
00:08:19.171 --> 00:08:22.800
they compress and they solidify and they turn into limestone.

126
00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:29.040
<v 2>You're saying that these rocks are made out of thousands and thousands of little</v>

127
00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:34.900
critters. Critters pretty much thought a rock couldn't have been a lie.

128
00:08:34.930 --> 00:08:37.600
That's saying that, that that rock is composed of something,

129
00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:40.330
many thousands of things that were once alive. Yeah.

130
00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:43.570
I don't know whether I would necessarily call the show part of the live,

131
00:08:43.571 --> 00:08:45.340
but it doesn't matter. I'd heard what I needed to hear.

132
00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:50.110
They do have a little bit of life inside them in a very real tangible,

133
00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:54.820
see-able way. Like not a poetic idea. They do. Yeah they do.

134
00:08:55.770 --> 00:08:56.190
They do.

135
00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:58.020
<v 4>I mean it was there at one point.</v>

136
00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:01.940
<v 2>I'm sure I must have in some other way learn this.</v>

137
00:09:01.941 --> 00:09:05.120
I mean this is basic rock knowledge, but I somehow missed it.

138
00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:07.100
You sound very excited. Yes,

139
00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:12.070
he gives me my friends back like with a scientist wand. All right. But, but,

140
00:09:12.610 --> 00:09:15.530
but yes, this is not actually the story I want to tell you.

141
00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:19.550
I'm not, I'm sorry it took me a little long to get here.

142
00:09:19.551 --> 00:09:24.551
But the real story I wanna tell you is about a very similar thing happening only

143
00:09:26.211 --> 00:09:28.250
with much bigger consequences

144
00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:33.020
cause we kept on riding in the Utah Hills.

145
00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:36.190
We make it through one of the hardest days of biking ever.

146
00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:40.540
And we finally make it to Cedar City, Utah. And we decided to go out for it.

147
00:09:40.570 --> 00:09:45.130
Pizza to celebrate. We're taking a first bite. And then Jeff,

148
00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:47.950
who's usually so just like polite and sweet,

149
00:09:47.951 --> 00:09:50.200
he slammed down his root beer and he says,

150
00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:55.960
I was supposed to be getting married today. Whoa. What does that mean?

151
00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:58.000
Well, that's what we thought. We were like, what?

152
00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:03.360
Finally he told us this whole story that actually a couple months before the

153
00:10:04.181 --> 00:10:08.080
bike trip, one Tuesday they were making dinner together.

154
00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:12.840
<v 4>We were at her house and we were cooking and you basically suddenly felt this</v>

155
00:10:12.841 --> 00:10:17.370
feeling inside his chest like right behind my sternum. I just thought,

156
00:10:17.371 --> 00:10:21.690
shit, I don't believe in God anymore.

157
00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:28.110
Really? Yeah. Yeah.

158
00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:32.700
This just landed on him out of the blue. Completely without warning. Wait,

159
00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:35.730
where? Where, where? What was it? When did it feel like?

160
00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:45.170
I don't know. I don't even know if it was like words, but it was just,

161
00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:46.940
I believe in God.

162
00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:53.180
Were you then terrified? Yeah. Who wouldn't be?

163
00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:56.260
He believed in God his entire life. Yeah.

164
00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:59.720
And now gone just like that.

165
00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:02.180
Was he thinking about something or, I don't know.

166
00:11:02.210 --> 00:11:04.790
I kept asking him and that was the best he could say.

167
00:11:05.210 --> 00:11:08.030
And Megan saw the look on his face and asked him what was wrong.

168
00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:13.070
I didn't say anything at the time, I'm just like, just have indigestion. Um,

169
00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:18.080
you know, but a few weeks later I filled her in on the, and that was probably,

170
00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:20.420
you know, Megan's a person,

171
00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:25.780
deep belief and that was something she wanted her husband to be at least

172
00:11:28.161 --> 00:11:32.150
somewhat on board with. So they put the wedding on hold,

173
00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:36.560
postponed it in good faith that we will work things out. So in a way,

174
00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:42.460
what he was doing on the bike trip was literally like scanning the hillsides to

175
00:11:43.311 --> 00:11:47.330
find some evidence of God to win back his bread. Oh,

176
00:11:47.331 --> 00:11:51.800
so this wasn't like a pre wedding reflective ride thing at all? No Way.

177
00:11:52.130 --> 00:11:54.220
And you're saying he wanted evidence? Yes.

178
00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:55.180
<v 5>Evidence or proof.</v>

179
00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:59.140
I wanted it to be on one side of the fence or the other is one demand for God

180
00:11:59.141 --> 00:12:03.490
was a few exists and you're at all interested in people.

181
00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:06.190
Show yourself there is no reason you shouldn't.

182
00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:09.940
So that whole time when I was riding along thinking gay,

183
00:12:09.941 --> 00:12:11.470
my rock buddies are back.

184
00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:16.810
Jeff was waiting for some signal from the landscape.

185
00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:21.310
Now there is a time where I'm climbing up this mountain when it comes up behind

186
00:12:21.311 --> 00:12:25.960
me and like I'm thinking, wow, this is great. It feels like I'm being pushed.

187
00:12:26.050 --> 00:12:30.640
Yeah. Is this just the wind or is this something else? I don't know.

188
00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:34.390
And for the three weeks he'd been riding, nothing had really convinced him? No,

189
00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:37.120
no. He was just frustrated, despondent,

190
00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:41.560
angry in six days after what was supposed to be Jeff's wedding day, June 4th,

191
00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:44.230
we, um,

192
00:12:44.450 --> 00:12:45.500
<v 2>part ways.</v>

193
00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:50.660
And then I had no idea what became of him. Huh?

194
00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:54.860
I didn't hear anything from him for almost a year.

195
00:12:56.390 --> 00:13:00.020
And then I guess he had my phone number from just, you know,

196
00:13:00.021 --> 00:13:05.021
we'd had each other's phones while we were traveling together and he called and

197
00:13:05.061 --> 00:13:07.910
said that he was on a little road trip and he's going to be passing through

198
00:13:07.911 --> 00:13:09.890
Charlottesville and could he stay with me for a night?

199
00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:12.450
<v 5>Hello? Hello, hello.</v>

200
00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:16.040
<v 2>And I said, sure, do you want to set that? You want to set the scene for us?</v>

201
00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:19.340
And basically this second he arrives, I asked him, okay,

202
00:13:19.341 --> 00:13:23.930
so what happened in your gray hair? Have you found God, are you with Megan?

203
00:13:23.931 --> 00:13:24.764
And I wonder if like

204
00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:26.700
<v 4>where are you at with all that? Oh,</v>

205
00:13:29.650 --> 00:13:33.530
you know, like that's right there. Um,

206
00:13:34.530 --> 00:13:38.280
<v 2>he told me that toward the end of his ride he started to get really anxious.</v>

207
00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:42.760
<v 4>Okay. Trips almost over. Got like a week.</v>

208
00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:46.310
And are you thinking like

209
00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:51.040
<v 5>lightning bolts? Show me a, an angel, what are you, what are you hoping to see?</v>

210
00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:52.833
<v 4>Anything.</v>

211
00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:57.540
And then he tells me there was a point outside of Hazard Kentucky or just

212
00:13:57.541 --> 00:13:58.420
feeling really low.

213
00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:03.480
And then I was eating lunch at Arby's and I know this is where the story gets

214
00:14:04.961 --> 00:14:09.550
embarrassing. Um, a ceiling tile fell on my sandwich. Okay. Yeah.

215
00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:13.870
And I'm like a plaster ceiling. Yeah. Like one of the drop ceiling tiles.

216
00:14:13.871 --> 00:14:16.720
Just splat. Wow. Yeah. And so,

217
00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:20.520
<v 2>and then what happened is a guy sitting over at the next table noticed him,</v>

218
00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:24.430
<v 4>walks over and gives me a sandwich when we got to talking. And of course, like,</v>

219
00:14:24.490 --> 00:14:29.050
you know, he's a minister and,

220
00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:31.740
<v 2>and Jeff just starts telling him everything that's going on.</v>

221
00:14:32.410 --> 00:14:35.740
He's having trouble with his face and how he's not sure what's going to happen

222
00:14:35.741 --> 00:14:36.390
with Megan.

223
00:14:36.390 --> 00:14:40.980
<v 4>So we talked about that for a while and at the end of the conversation the man</v>

224
00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:46.050
gives Jeff a blessing like append addiction, have a good journey,

225
00:14:46.410 --> 00:14:51.090
be safe. And I hate to recount it because it just sounds so a ceiling tile fell.

226
00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:55.220
The guy came over and talked to me like, is that really remarkable?

227
00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:59.780
But in that dark place I feel like maybe it was

228
00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:04.130
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

229
00:15:04.130 --> 00:15:07.790
<v 5>I don't know. And I'm confused.</v>

230
00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:12.710
And when he finally made it home to Megan, that's what he told her.

231
00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:15.280
I don't know. Yeah,

232
00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:20.330
we both just kind of sat there for a long time cause we didn't really know what

233
00:15:20.331 --> 00:15:21.164
to do with that.

234
00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:26.530
But I knew in my heart that I wanted to marry someone who shared my faith and

235
00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:33.090
just kept hoping that he would find his faith again.

236
00:15:33.290 --> 00:15:37.340
And this was just a phase or something and it was much bigger than that.

237
00:15:38.630 --> 00:15:43.220
And eventually I figured out what I wanted to do and cried a lot. And

238
00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:45.383
<v 1>then</v>

239
00:15:46.010 --> 00:15:47.840
<v 5>I went and talked to him at his house.</v>

240
00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:51.170
She just sat him down and gave him his ring back.

241
00:15:52.950 --> 00:15:57.510
It was really sad. Neither of us wanted that to happen.

242
00:15:57.570 --> 00:15:58.403
We

243
00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:03.780
cried together a little bit and then I think he needed me to just leave.

244
00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:05.753
Yeah.

245
00:16:06.090 --> 00:16:09.960
It was definitely hard to walk out of that room.

246
00:16:13.570 --> 00:16:17.580
<v 4>It didn't work out. So I'm up in Columbus,</v>

247
00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:22.660
I'm staying in Columbus. Um, because I like it there. Um,

248
00:16:23.370 --> 00:16:26.360
I know you moved up to Columbus to be with her, right? Yeah.

249
00:16:27.150 --> 00:16:31.440
So he got a job turning riches of the bicycle shop. Yeah.

250
00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:33.780
It's a long way from Geo statistics.

251
00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:35.450
<v 1>Yeah. Rocks.</v>

252
00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.630
I'm sorry, I didn't realize.

253
00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:47.550
<v 4>No, don't be, um, I'm gonna try. Okay. Yeah.</v>

254
00:16:49.210 --> 00:16:54.210
I turned off the tape recorder and took him out to a really good bar again.

255
00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:57.670
He's headed back to Columbus and you know, just down

256
00:16:59.470 --> 00:17:03.480
and that's it. That was just, it. That was kind of their ending and I, you know,

257
00:17:03.481 --> 00:17:06.490
I figured that's end of story. And then,

258
00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:12.960
<v 5>yeah, another year goes by. And luckily we moved slowly on,</v>

259
00:17:12.961 --> 00:17:17.820
taped on stories and a strange invitation appears in my mailbox.

260
00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:22.860
I open it up and it's an invitation to Jeff Vineyard and Megan Swain.

261
00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:27.450
These wedding really wait, a year goes by,

262
00:17:27.451 --> 00:17:32.300
you just suddenly get a thing to their wedding. What happened? Um,

263
00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:34.750
all right. Shall we commence Lulu? We shall commence.

264
00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:38.520
Well I didn't know what happened. Megan

265
00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:43.030
<v 4>is walking up right now actually. Hi. All right,</v>

266
00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:48.490
well first of all, I like what happened cause I've, I know nothing. Um,

267
00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:50.170
well let's

268
00:17:50.370 --> 00:17:52.590
<v 2>have him tell that story and then we'll go from there.</v>

269
00:17:55.410 --> 00:17:55.650
Um,

270
00:17:55.650 --> 00:17:59.530
<v 5>I had reached a point where I was actually back in attending church.</v>

271
00:17:59.531 --> 00:18:04.360
I had found a really friendly congregation here in town.

272
00:18:05.050 --> 00:18:05.883
Um,

273
00:18:05.950 --> 00:18:09.910
I was just looking for something familiar because I moved up here and the one

274
00:18:09.911 --> 00:18:13.180
person I know is not in my life and I need something else.

275
00:18:13.181 --> 00:18:16.360
So I wasn't necessarily going for the preaching.

276
00:18:16.361 --> 00:18:18.560
I was just going for the experience in,

277
00:18:18.750 --> 00:18:22.240
for kind of the pure on the bum and the people around, you know. Right.

278
00:18:22.270 --> 00:18:26.800
I mean I was, I was singing with our church choir at that point because,

279
00:18:26.890 --> 00:18:29.650
you know, I wasn't really sure whether I had any faith or not,

280
00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:31.180
but gosh darn are now like singing.

281
00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:33.320
<v 2>And then he told me one day</v>

282
00:18:33.630 --> 00:18:37.000
<v 5>just some, Gosh darn Sunday, I don't know what we were singing.</v>

283
00:18:37.001 --> 00:18:39.050
I don't know what the sermon was about. Um,

284
00:18:40.290 --> 00:18:44.100
but we were taking communion as I was taking the elements.

285
00:18:44.101 --> 00:18:46.230
I just said he just suddenly felt like

286
00:18:48.210 --> 00:18:49.350
the air charge,

287
00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:55.080
like there is a palpable presence all around,

288
00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:58.260
just, just almost like a tempest.

289
00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:05.580
I felt there was something there. Was it something you felt up in your head?

290
00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:11.520
Was it something you felt sternum mostly beneath the sternum.

291
00:19:11.870 --> 00:19:16.610
Huh? The tightness a hand, something touching there. Huh.

292
00:19:17.010 --> 00:19:20.940
Very strange. I don't know what to make it that still. Um,

293
00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:24.930
I'm still not sure if it was something defined,

294
00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:29.700
another worldly or if it was just a profound appreciation for the history of

295
00:19:29.701 --> 00:19:31.200
that gesture. Um,

296
00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:36.330
had almost just wanna say like Jeff Right now.

297
00:19:36.930 --> 00:19:41.730
Do you believe in God? Yeah.

298
00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:47.160
It's just really different from what I felt earlier

299
00:19:50.970 --> 00:19:53.670
and it's still very uncertain.

300
00:19:56.710 --> 00:20:00.790
<v 2>Megan, when when you hear him talk about doubt, is it scary?</v>

301
00:20:00.791 --> 00:20:02.440
Is it something you can relate to? I mean how,

302
00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:04.690
like how does it strike you when he talks about it?

303
00:20:05.110 --> 00:20:09.760
It is a little scary cause I think it's still a hard thing for us.

304
00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:14.080
Keep in mind, I'm talking to them 10 days before they're about to get married.

305
00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:16.990
Is it 10 or 11 I think it's 10 yeah,

306
00:20:17.790 --> 00:20:20.230
10 some days.

307
00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:25.570
Sometimes it seems like we're really close on how we believe and sometimes it

308
00:20:25.571 --> 00:20:27.160
seems like we're miles apart.

309
00:20:28.690 --> 00:20:32.410
<v 5>It's confusing sometimes but that's, I don't know. I'm okay with that.</v>

310
00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:36.330
<v 2>And Megan are, are you okay with that? I am.</v>

311
00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:41.250
I don't know if it's just me still wishing a little,

312
00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:44.280
but his faith is a little more like mine. Maybe.

313
00:20:44.281 --> 00:20:48.040
I haven't completely let go of that. But on

314
00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:49.420
<v 0>a day to day basis,</v>

315
00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:54.880
we pray together in the evenings and are able to talk about religious things

316
00:20:55.721 --> 00:20:57.520
without fighting with each other.

317
00:20:57.521 --> 00:21:02.521
And I think that whatever differences we do have are okay.

318
00:21:03.641 --> 00:21:04.474
Now

319
00:21:08.490 --> 00:21:09.690
<v 5>love is a choice.</v>

320
00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:13.890
I think after a certain point we just chose that we were going to love each

321
00:21:13.891 --> 00:21:14.724
other anyway.

322
00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:22.810
<v 1>[inaudible] they go forward and they get married. Yeah,</v>

323
00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:25.710
<v 5>it was a religious ceremony. And</v>

324
00:21:26.030 --> 00:21:28.120
<v 1>do they say their vow?</v>

325
00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:34.630
[inaudible] thank you Megan. Be My one promise before God,

326
00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:37.600
before God and all who are present here

327
00:21:38.890 --> 00:21:43.600
<v 5>and what was just like, as he's saying his vows, you can hear</v>

328
00:21:51.990 --> 00:21:52.090
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

329
00:21:52.090 --> 00:21:57.090
<v 5>biggest sob I've ever heard just like comes out of his voice like that.</v>

330
00:21:58.050 --> 00:22:00.270
It, it just felt like bigger than him.

331
00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:05.973
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

332
00:22:05.980 --> 00:22:10.980
<v 5>Jeff said later that what that was was not the sound of resolution</v>

333
00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:19.610
but of relief worth long as we go. [inaudible]

334
00:22:20.430 --> 00:22:21.263
<v 1>perfect.</v>

335
00:22:27.030 --> 00:22:29.910
It is my great pleasure to introduce to you,

336
00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:33.640
Mr and Mrs Jeffrey and Megan Vineyard.

337
00:22:52.570 --> 00:22:53.403
[inaudible] [inaudible]

338
00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:09.593
[inaudible]

339
00:23:10.030 --> 00:23:13.420
