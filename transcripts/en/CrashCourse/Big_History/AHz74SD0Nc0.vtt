00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.240
Hi, I’m Emily Graslie, and welcome to Crash
Course Big History, where today we’ll be

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.870
discussing a tweak in our evolutionary traits
that led us to innovate so rapidly in the

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:11.400
last 250,000 years.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.490
Natural selection is no slouch at innovating.

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:18.310
We’ve moved from a planet populated by single
cell organisms just 700 million years ago

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:23.950
to all the wondrous multi-celled giants that
we see around us: mammals, birds, bivalves,

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:27.680
insects and invertebrates, reptiles, amphibians,
plants, and it goes on.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.330
There have been millions upon millions of
species past and present.

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:36.630
Yet natural selection requires death, extinction,
random variation and non-random selection

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:37.630
to innovate.

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:41.969
It is a process that takes an arduous amount
of time - small changes, generation after

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.789
generation, and ultimately epoch after epoch.

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.149
Mistakes and successes mount up over thousands,
millions, and billions of years.

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:53.090
Cultural evolution, on the other hand, takes
innovation out of the hands of the more sluggish

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:57.190
DNA and evolutionary instincts and into the
marketplace of ideas.

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:02.039
Good ideas, bad ideas, can be tinkered with,
exploited, and improved within a single generation

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.140
at rates that random variations in our DNA
cannot.

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.020
Racing down the path of adaptation, instead
of a horse and cart on a dirt road, we are

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.080
soaring ahead in a private jet, and higher
rates of complexity are the result.

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:24.780
It’s a rise with no immediate end in sight.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.290
The Latin name for our species, Homo sapiens,
means “wise man” which is kind of an arrogant

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:30.570
name to give yourself.

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.960
But it isn’t just being “wise” that
has led to the massive rise of complexity

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.420
in human societies over the past 250,000 years.

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.031
In the last season of Crash Course Big History,
we covered “collective learning” — the

00:01:41.031 --> 00:01:45.740
ability of a species to accumulate more information
with each passing generation than is lost

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:46.950
by the next.

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.950
Eventually these innovations stack up.

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.580
Homo sapiens went from stone tools to skyscrapers,
rather than living in the same ecosystems

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.060
and living the same lifestyles as we did a
quarter of a million years ago.

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.300
The history of rising human complexitIes involves
tinkering with some form of prior knowledge

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.590
rather than spontaneous genius.

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.580
Cultural evolution rarely makes leaps.

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.369
The Rolex watch wasn’t invented overnight
when an early human spilled her dinner on

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.610
a bear-skin blanket and it just so happened
to resemble the shape of a wristwatch.

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.260
The Rolex was the result of centuries of tinkering
and slight improvements over generations.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.450
The higher the population, the more potential
innovators you have.

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.129
Which is why things began to snowball after
the invention of agriculture, and even more

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:29.300
after the Industrial Revolution in the 18th
and 19th centuries.

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:34.189
Instead of small tribes of a few dozen, potential
innovators became groups of thousands, millions,

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:35.319
and now billions.

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:39.439
Not everybody in a human society thinks up
new ideas: some ideas are forgotten, and some

00:02:39.439 --> 00:02:40.480
people come up with bad ideas.

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:41.480
The self-pedalling shower, for instance, or
hydrogen blimps like the Hindenburg, or mullets…

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:42.480
these are all… not great ideas.

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.189
But on a long enough time scale, every generation
you get a population of skilled inventors

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:46.480
with new ideas.

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.489
The good ideas that stick are remembered by
humans, perhaps set to writing, then adjusted

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:53.939
and explored generation after generation,
and improved once again.

00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:57.019
As a result, you probably aren’t out carving
your own stone tools right now.

00:02:57.019 --> 00:02:58.090
You are watching me.

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.489
Why humans evolved the capacity for collective
learning remains a mystery.

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:06.050
But like all mysteries in history and evolutionary
biology, this one must be explored on the

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:07.140
basis of the evidence.

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.909
Basically, we wanna know, “What makes humans
different?”, at least in an evolutionary

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:11.909
sense.

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:14.590
The differences don’t just stem from our
adept use of communication.

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.390
Plenty of animals communicate with each other.

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.439
This might be done visually, like a male peacock
displaying its brightly coloured feathers

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:21.439
as a courtship gesture.

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:24.930
It might be a dog baring its teeth, as a sign
of aggression.

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.739
It might be audible, like a gopher letting
out a warning squeak that a predator is nearby.

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:31.950
It might be a smell, like ants communicating
through pheromones.

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:36.680
It might even be something as intricate as
whale songs that carry over large distances.

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.860
Here you have transmission of information,
but no steady accumulation generation after

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:42.909
generation, thus no collective learning.

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:45.999
And it’s not just because we’re exceptionally
good teachers.

00:03:45.999 --> 00:03:50.230
Sperm whales teach their calves the dialects
of their particular language: the specific

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.260
clicks, moans, and frequencies.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.840
Meerkats that feed on scorpions demonstrate
how to carefully handle their venomous prey.

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.189
Baboons teach each other more efficient ways
to hunt.

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:02.590
And chimpanzees educate their young on how
to fish termites out of the ground for an

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:03.639
afternoon snack.

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:07.040
But still, there’s no tinkering, or improvement,
and no accumulation.

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.870
Thus, it’s not collective learning.

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.819
But the seeds of this communication and learning
were there for a long time in the evolutionary

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:16.400
tree, since those traits are present in many
other species.

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.199
At some point between our separation from
our last common ancestor with chimpanzees

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:25.751
5-7 million years ago, and the emergence of
Homo sapiens 250,000 years ago, evolution

00:04:25.751 --> 00:04:29.430
built up these skills for communication and
learning and allowed it to be stored in the

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.110
collective memories of human groups.

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:35.610
And while our big brains provide use with
very useful hardware, large brain sizes wouldn’t

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:40.360
have evolved either, unless there was a very
specific evolutionary pressure for it.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.889
Brains need energy to run, and a big brain
needs a lot of energy.

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:48.020
Gathering food takes time, effort, and even
increases our chances of risk.

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.580
So there would have to be an evolutionary
incentive for it that outweighed the potential

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:52.580
costs.

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:56.020
The original increase in primate brain size
relative to body mass in the ancestors of

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:00.930
monkeys and apes, was the need to process
3D visual information from when we were living

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.479
in trees- mostly so we didn’t tumble down
to our deaths.

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:05.060
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:09.030
We also know that in all groups of primates,
brain power is needed to navigate their fairly

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:11.550
complex social hierarchies and alliances.

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:15.639
These hierarchies often determine access to
food, mates, and ultimately to the continual

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:16.639
survival of an individual’s DNA.

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:17.639
The higher you are in the hierarchy, the better
your evolutionary opportunities are.

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:20.730
And it takes a lot of care to maintain your
place in such a hierarchy….

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:25.880
like in pre-modern aristocracies, modern politics,
celebrity circles, and, unfortunately, sometimes

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:27.120
in high school.

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.820
As such, skills at communication and learning,
along with the brain power to keep up with

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:34.159
those social pressures, were useful neurological
traits to evolve.

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:38.580
Chimpanzees, for instance, are able to communicate
a wide range of information and can even be

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:42.180
taught to recognize quite a few symbols, on
par with a human toddler.

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:46.229
But, their larynxes only allow them to vocalise
a limited range of sounds.

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:50.190
This seems to have remained the case in the
early hominids Australopithecines and Homo

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:51.190
habilis.

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:54.390
There is even some debate whether even the
Neanderthals had more limitations on sound

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:55.419
than humans.

00:05:55.419 --> 00:05:59.800
That said, much of primate communication is
done, like with many other animals, through

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:00.800
gesticulation.

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.910
And even today, gesture is a large part of
day-to-day human communication to convey information.

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:08.800
Everything from moving your hands while you
talk, to a cheerful thumbs up, to more offensive

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.729
hand gestures communicate meaning.

00:06:10.729 --> 00:06:14.580
There’s also your facial expressions and
your body posture, which aid in expression.

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:18.780
Still, without language, our hominid ancestors
were able to communicate information, adapt

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:22.060
to new environments, use tools, and travel
across the world.

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:23.129
Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:06:23.129 --> 00:06:26.919
Humans do communicate successfully with gestures-
but there’s a huge capacity for complex

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:29.080
language and abstract thought as well.

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:32.930
And at some point in our evolutionary history,
this went into overdrive.

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:36.630
In order to solve this mystery, scientists
have assembled a gaggle of hypotheses that

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:40.440
to this day are being evaluated by careful
scrutiny of the evidence.

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:44.199
Perhaps complex human language evolved because
better communication between mothers and their

00:06:44.199 --> 00:06:47.080
offspring favoured the survival of infant
primates.

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:52.750
So, maybe 3.5 million years ago when Australopithecus
became bipedal, mothers stopped carrying infants

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:55.550
on their backs as often, like chimpanzees
do.

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:58.889
Instead mothers would need another way to
look after their young when looking for food

00:06:58.889 --> 00:07:01.360
- like, talking in order to exchange information.

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:02.810
“Are you in danger?

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:03.810
Behave yourself!

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:05.080
Stop throwing things at your brother.”

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:09.240
Perhaps somewhere between the evolution of
Homo habilis 2.8 million years ago and Homo

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:14.310
erectus 1.9 million years ago, groups got
bigger thanks to the use of their tools.

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:18.540
And bigger groups meant the old ways of forming
alliances in most primates became more difficult.

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:19.540
Namely, grooming.

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:21.539
You can’t give everyone a haircut.

00:07:21.539 --> 00:07:23.810
Instead, another way of forming bonds emerged.

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:27.939
There was gossip and banter- perhaps first
as sounds, then later evolving into more precise

00:07:27.939 --> 00:07:29.500
exchanges of information.

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:34.139
This progression of complex ideas may come
down to our increasing consumption of meat.

00:07:34.139 --> 00:07:37.860
In some parts of East Africa for the past
few million years, vegetation may have at

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:38.949
times been scarce.

00:07:38.949 --> 00:07:42.720
Our ancestors started scavenging more and
more meat from corpses.

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:46.659
Meat packs more energy per bite than vegetables,
and this boost to our metabolisms might have

00:07:46.659 --> 00:07:47.870
increased brain size.

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:51.710
Or maybe it’s as simple as when Homo habilis
and its descendants started using tools with

00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:53.139
their hands more frequently.

00:07:53.139 --> 00:07:57.310
They had to evolve stronger vocalizations
in order to communicate effectively hands-free.

00:07:57.310 --> 00:08:02.430
Yet another option is that advanced communication
may have evolved as a form of sexual selection.

00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:06.880
It is possible that hominine females preferred
mates that were capable of two things: either

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:10.650
expressing themselves in a range of ways,
such that the male essentially “talked”

00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:14.979
their way into a relationship, and that females
may have preferred males that were able to

00:08:14.979 --> 00:08:19.419
both transmit and receive pertinent information
so they increased their chances of survival

00:08:19.419 --> 00:08:21.539
and their ability to provide for their young.

00:08:21.539 --> 00:08:25.830
But all of these hypotheses presume some sort
of environmental change that endangered the

00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:30.210
survival chances of our ancestors, making
these evolutionary traits grow stronger more

00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:31.210
rapidly.

00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:35.169
And indeed we know that the climate of Africa
was fluctuating very rapidly over the past

00:08:35.169 --> 00:08:40.139
4 million years, meaning our ancestors had
to adapt faster in order to survive.

00:08:40.139 --> 00:08:44.050
Something must have made the benefits of operating
a larger and more flexible brain outweigh

00:08:44.050 --> 00:08:47.830
the costs of stocking up on food and keeping
it humming with energy.

00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:50.860
Afterall, natural selection doesn’t do anything
for free.

00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:54.779
When it comes to testing these theories, only
a limited amount of evidence can be yielded

00:08:54.779 --> 00:08:57.839
from fossils and discoveries of ancient toolkits.

00:08:57.839 --> 00:09:01.120
Those research endeavours in Africa have only
just scratched the surface.

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:04.940
Another way of testing those theories is to
look at our evolutionary cousins today, particularly

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:09.601
the great apes, in order to understand the
dominant and useful traits that may have been

00:09:09.601 --> 00:09:10.601
shared by our ancestors.

00:09:10.601 --> 00:09:14.000
It could be that all of the hypotheses we
covered are valid and were working under evolutionary

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.050
pressures simultaneously.

00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:18.209
Or perhaps it’s something we haven’t considered
yet.

00:09:18.209 --> 00:09:23.150
The big question is, when did our capacity
for learning and communication begin to resemble

00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:24.170
collective learning?

00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:28.900
There’s evidence that Homo erectus, which
existed 1.9 million years ago, made small

00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:32.590
improvements to early tools, but that happened
over several hundred thousand years.

00:09:32.590 --> 00:09:36.680
There is significantly more evidence that
the species in between us and Homo erectus

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:38.910
improved their technologies much more quickly.

00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:42.720
There’s very little doubt that the newcomer,
Homo sapiens, was really good at collective

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:43.720
learning.

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:46.950
But we aren’t even completely sure where
we fit with all these other species on the

00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:47.950
evolutionary tree.

00:09:47.950 --> 00:09:51.150
Were our immediate predecessors also very
gifted at collective learning?

00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:54.050
We won’t know until more digs are performed
and more discoveries are made.

00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:58.480
And it pushes back the genesis of collective
learning to a very special set of conditions

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:01.120
and traits that existed 2 to 3 million years
ago.

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:05.320
Like any history book, the pages of the grand
narrative are filled with blank spots that

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:07.640
require more research, fact-finding, and interpretation.

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:12.760
It would be very convenient if we had an existing
species or an extinct species in the fossil

00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:16.570
record with a similar degree of collective
learning to compare to humans.

00:10:16.570 --> 00:10:21.180
But it is possible that if such a species
had existed on Earth previously – dinosaurs

00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:25.260
building skyscrapers and sharing pictures
on Instagram – that there may not have been

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:28.300
room for our species to enter the same evolutionary
niche.

00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:33.700
In the past 3.8 billion years of Earth’s
history, this sort of behaviour is unprecedented.

00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:38.470
We humans seem to have stumbled into it by
some mysterious quirk of natural selection.

00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:42.560
And until we’re able to observe our evolutionary
cousins a little more, the blank pages of

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:47.550
human evolution will stay blank, awaiting
the day when another potential innovator tinkers,

00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:51.100
improves, and adds their own piece of collective
learning upon them.

00:10:51.100 --> 00:11:16.649
Thanks for watching, see you next time.
