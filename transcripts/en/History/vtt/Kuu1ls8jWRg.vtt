00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:02.830
- Bladesmiths, this is the
strength test.

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:05.040
To test the strength and
durability of your edge,

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.880
I'm going to chop into
these bones six times each.

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.290
This test is all about what
the bones do to your blades

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.710
and not what your blades
do to these bones.

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:13.500
Brian, you're up first.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.000
Swing hard.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.790
I know no other way.

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:19.210
BRIAN: I'm just worried.

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:20.540
They're pretty big bones.

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:22.580
And anybody that
watches this show

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.380
knows that edge damage
or blade breakage gets

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.250
you sent home pretty quick.

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.210
Well, Brian, your
edge held up perfectly.

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.580
Awesome.

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:44.830
Other than a whole lot
of bone dust on here,

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:46.920
I don't see any
issue with the edge.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.420
It still seems very sharp.

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:50.170
Very well done.

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:51.040
Thank you.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.920
Matt, you're up next.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.040
Are you already?

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.880
I'm as ready as
I'm going to be.

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.210
MAN: All right.

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.830
MATT: Bone is nasty.

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:02.380
I'm nervous about the
epoxy I put on the blade.

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:04.120
I'm just hoping this
knife's going to hold.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.290
Well, Matt, the
epoxy stayed on.

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:19.960
Good deal.

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.040
[laughter]

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.210
There's some chipping that
happened up here at the edge.

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.380
But the whole thing
held together.

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:28.120
Well done.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:29.210
Thank you.

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:30.460
Tyler, you're up.

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:31.380
You ready?

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.210
I want to do it.

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.790
But I'm ready.

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.120
TYLER: I think that my knife's
going to destroy the bone.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.120
Fragments are going
to fly everywhere.

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.290
I'd swing at those bones
till either I broke down

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.250
or the blade broke down.

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.330
I was hoping it would cut
all the way through it.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.330
Well, Tyler, there is some
chipping along the blade

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:04.750
here from the bone.

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.330
And the handle is very round.

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.500
It just wasn't super duper
comfortable in my head.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.460
But overall, well done.
- Appreciate it.

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:15.830
Thank you.

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.120
Up next is the sharpness test.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.500
And for that, I
give you to Dave.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.960
All right, gentlemen, to test
the sharpness of your blade,

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.500
I'll be slicing into
those ropes three times.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:26.880
Brian, you're up first.
Are you ready?

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:27.710
Let's go.
DAVE: OK.

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.380
All right, Brian, it's
a very sharp blade.

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.460
And they cut the
rope pretty cleanly.

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:48.210
But it wasn't able to cut
very deeply because that edge

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.670
geometry is very stout.

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.460
As far as the feel goes,
it's a little bit square

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:54.960
on the back of the handle.

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.500
Right here, it'd be nice
to see that rounded over.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.500
But it's definitely a cutter.

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:00.620
Thank you.

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:01.880
DAVE: Matt, you ready?

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.380
Let's put it on the floor.
DAVE: OK.

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:15.380
- Yes!
- Good job.

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:16.880
[clapping]

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.580
This fix you came
up with was ingenious.

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:21.920
I call that epoxy Damascus.

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.250
DAVE: [laughs] Your
edge is extremely sharp.

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.500
I mean, you can see
it's cleanly cut.

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:29.250
Nicely done.

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:30.710
Thank you.

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:31.920
Tyler, you ready?

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:32.670
Yeah, I'm ready.

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:33.250
OK.

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.620
Tyler, you can see,
your rope, it's cut.

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.460
The issue I have is
with this handle.

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:53.750
I had to adjust after every hit.

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:57.040
Every time I hit, that
knife would roll in my hand.

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.960
There's just no
contouring to it.

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:03.790
It makes for a very
difficult knife to control.

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.620
Bladesmiths, the judges have
completed their deliberation

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.460
and they've made
a final decision.

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:10.290
It's time for
another elimination.

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.460
Tyler, your blade
did not make the cut.

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:21.620
Tyler, we've always said that
the handle is what connects

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:23.750
the end user to the blade.

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:26.290
Your handle was a little bit
on the cylindrical side, which

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:27.920
makes it hard to hold on to.

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:29.790
And your blade took some damage.

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:32.670
And it just wasn't the sharpest
out of your competitors.

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:35.460
For those reasons, we
have to let you go.

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:38.080
All right, Tyler, please,
surrender your blade.

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.330
TYLER: From the damage that
was done from the bone,

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.460
it dulled the piss out of it.

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:48.500
But I've learned more in the
past few hours than I have

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:49.960
since I've started
bladesmithing.

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.120
And I believe it
will make me a better

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.170
bladesmith in the future.

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:57.170
