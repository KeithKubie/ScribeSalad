00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.760
This restaurant is famous for serving ribs

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:05.340
oh this one is Konro Bakar

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:07.340
Yeah. Konro Bakar

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:08.560
yeah ... OK

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.280
photo? ... thank you terima kasih

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:15.060
this drumstick rib is so beautiful

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.120
I just got to take a bite out of it immediately

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:25.800
oh that's insane!

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:28.680
oh wow!

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.560
Hey everyone its Mark Weins with migrationology.com

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.600
in Jakarta, Indonesia

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.160
for lunch I am really excited to be at a restaurant

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.940
called Sop Konro Karebosi

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.720
and this is a restaurant that is well known for serving ribs

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.620
in a number of different ways

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.440
they are beef ribs

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.420
and especially they specialize in food from Makassar

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.400
which is in the southern part of the island of Sulawesi

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.780
this is a really cool restaurant

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.220
nice open-air, very spacious

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.420
and you can smell the aroma of the roasted ribs

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.960
throughout this entire restaurant

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.740
this restaurant is in an area called Kelapa Gading

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.980
and this is kind of on the ... what side is this on?

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:20.060
It is on the ... Western ...

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.120
North-Western side of Jakarta

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.640
and there are a lot of restaurants around here

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:29.960
and this restaurant is famous for serving ribs

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.800
and so I got a couple of different versions. Plus some grilled fish

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.320
the first dish that I got here is the Konro Bakar

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.480
and these are the grilled ribs

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:40.860
and they smell unbelievable!

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.380
and after they were finished grilling roasting

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.840
they put on a couple of scoops of peanut sauce

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.200
I think that is peanut sauce all over these ribs

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.820
look at that hand held rib!

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.120
this drumstick rib is so beautiful

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.820
I just got to take a bite out of it immediately

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.540
oh that's insane!

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:11.360
oh wow!

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.360
its so tender!

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:14.820
as I just took the first bite

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:16.880
the meat literally just started

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.660
sliding right off the bone

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.260
look at that!

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.980
Oh that is .. that is just wonderful!

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.500
Oh man! It's so tender

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.700
and fatty. And just insanely fragrant.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.480
You can really really taste the smokiness of the grill on those ribs.

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.480
And then that is definitely a peanut sauce,

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:38.800
a little bit sweet,

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.480
But really nice and nutty. Great great flavor!

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.220
Let me just finish the meat on this bone real fast.

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:52.900
Now that I have this entire chunk of boneless rib on my plate,

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.460
I'm gonna mix it in with the rice and I think I will add

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:56.920
a little bit of that um,

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:58.380
Sambal to it

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.520
And i'm gonna season the rib meat with a squeeze of lime

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.900
to balance off that sweet peanut sauce.

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.320
And then i'm also gonna add on some of this Sambal.

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:11.940
It looks like there are chopped up tomatoes in here, and it looks like there are whole, little wedges of lime

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:12.820
As well

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.000
Let me add a little bit of that

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.220
Oh man!

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:29.860
Oh that is sensational!

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.360
The smokiness of that meat

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.380
is unbelievably good

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:35.160
And then,

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.720
with that sweet peanut sauce and then,

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.360
Counter-balanced by that squeeze of lime

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.240
And then that, that Sambal

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:44.960
Let me get a taste of that sambal again

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.480
I got a bite of that wedge of lime in that bite

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:57.100
That's sharply sour and a little bit bitter

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.180
I'm gonna follow that bite with a some of the soup

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.200
And I think this is the beef soup with a bunch of shallots in it

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:10.580
That has a bit nutty flavor to it

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:12.320
I think it is a beef soup

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:13.160
It's salty

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:17.060
And those crispy shallots are so fragrant in there

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.460
There's so many crispy shallots that it just kinda makes up the bulk of soup

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.500
And really oniony fried fragrance to it

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.000
In between rib dishes, i'm gonna have some of this fish

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:30.640
and this is a type of Ikan bakar grilled fish

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.920
They grilled it over a high fire so you can see those,

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.860
Oh, that bone just, the center bone just comes straight off

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.300
But yeah, you can see that, black charred, fragrant

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:41.400
Amazingness

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:42.960
On the edges of the fish

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:44.400
Let me take a piece of this.

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.180
Not sure what type of fish this is but look at that meat!

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.500
There's another Sambal chili sauce here

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.160
which was on the table, which i'm gonna add to this fish

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:55.960
This is a little bit of an oily Sambal but,

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:57.820
Oh, this is the type of Sambal I love!

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.940
One of the things you can do is just kind of break up the fish,

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:03.280
so that you can remove those bones before you eat it

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.060
Alright I think that's good, on with that Sambal

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:21.120
That's a really good fish!

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:25.120
It's kind of a dry fish as opposed to being oily

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:28.520
So it's very lean, and then, Yeah.

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.520
It's juicy though at the same time

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:33.920
It's dry but juicy, fantastic! And then with that Sambal

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:38.020
That sambal is like a little bit of a sour, oily chili sauce

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:44.280
And also we could not come here without ordering a plate of the soup Konro

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.340
Which is the name of this restaurant it's named after

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:49.020
And these are beef ribs in a soup

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.500
But it's served kind of on a soup plate

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:52.400
and

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:54.200
I think they're the same ribs

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:56.140
Just beautiful chunks

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:59.220
Oh, these are two ribs connected, oh fantastic!

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:04.360
And then in a brothy soup, and then just topped with a big handful of crispy fried shallots

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:05.340
Let me,

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:06.860
Let me try to just,

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:08.620
Break this with the,

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:14.800
The spoon and I will just, oh that just literally slides off the bone. That is incredible!

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:18.080
Look at that, just the naked bone is left

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:21.040
And that meat just comes off, so effortlessly

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:25.000
They don't have any, they don't serve you any knives in this restaurant because you don't need them

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:26.740
Oh look at that meat!

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:31.560
The only part that you gotta like, break off is that connecting tissue

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:36.620
And i'm gonna quickly add on a little bit of lime to that

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:40.680
And, okay.

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:42.680
Oh just look at that!

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:44.720
Look at that! That's just effortless!

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:47.600
Effortless! Look at those grains of meat in there

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:49.140
Oh wow!

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:00.740
That is so, unbelievably tender

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:03.660
And so, flavorful with those shallots

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:06.420
And a little bit of a nutty taste as well

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:07.400
In that soup

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:09.780
And then this is some lemon basil I believe

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:15.920
And i'm gonna add that with that lemon basil for this bite

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:22.400
I love the addition of that lemon basil!

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:24.760
That lemon basil is extremely fragrant!

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:27.360
It tastes, very similar to lemon grass

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:30.420
Additionally with just ordering a plain plate of white rice,

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:35.920
Right in the middle of the table, they have communally, on the top here,

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:39.160
These ones are called ketupat, which are the compressed rice cakes

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:40.500
And then on the bottom,

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:42.980
is something called Burasa (rice dumpling)

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:45.600
Which, i'm actually not sure what they are, this'll be my first time

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:47.200
I've had that Ketupat before

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:49.840
But i'm not sure what the Burasa are

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:52.100
So i'm gonna grab on of these

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:54.960
I'm gonna grab one of these

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:57.800
I think that they are wrapped in, yeah, this is banana leaf

00:07:58.320 --> 00:07:58.820
And

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:02.160
Oh yeah that's definitely rice

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:06.120
It smells a little bit sweet

00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:06.920
Um...

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:08.380
Maybe coconut milk?

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:10.140
Let me break off a piece

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:13.080
And I will dip it into this sauce

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:21.860
I think there's coconut milk in there

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:23.720
And then, it's also salty

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:26.100
The texture is a little bit sticky and mushy

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:28.140
And it tastes like it been, yeah, compressed

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:29.980
Into this little packet

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:37.060
And then maybe steamed in a banana leaf so it has kind of a banana, green fragrance to it

00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:37.860
It's really good

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:40.920
The rib meat! This meat is so so good

00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:41.680
And...

00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:43.720
Actually both of them are really good

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:46.520
I like the grilled one because it has more of a smoky flavor

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:47.640
But the,

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:51.600
The boiled soup one is also really good because it's so tender

00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:53.600
And you can really taste those crispy shallots

00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:56.300
And I like it with that Sambal as well

00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:58.700
Oh and that, I got a little bit more of that lemon basil

00:08:58.900 --> 00:08:59.560
Let me add,

00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:02.200
That lemon basil on there with that Sambal

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:12.720
It's so tender!

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:16.300
Just finished with those ribs and that fish

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:17.920
That was an excellent meal

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:21.880
I am feeling a little bit sluggish and heavy right now though

00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:25.320
That is definitely a meal for meat lovers

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:29.020
After such an incredible, beef ribs meal,

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:31.020
Ying and I have decided to take a walk

00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:34.000
This area is home to a lot of cafés and restaurants

00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:39.560
So we're gonna walk, just a little ways to an old coffee shop, and I hope it's open

00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:43.560
Cause the only thing that I could use right now is a cup of coffee

00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:02.080
The walk from the ribs restaurant took only about 10 minutes

00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:06.860
And this place is an old style coffee shop, coffee house

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:11.740
And it's actually kind of an entire food court so the coffee shop is at the very front

00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:16.020
And then there are a number of food stalls where you can get a number of different things

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:20.060
Cool place though, really nice, area of Jakarta

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:25.720
It's really quiet and really calm, really relaxing, and there are lots of trees in this area as well

00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:30.260
I ordered up a, just a black cup of coffee, and a pau

00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:33.740
So yeah, he is still preparing coffee in a traditional way

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:36.300
And I think that this coffee shop, from what I read is

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:38.820
a Manado style from Sulawesi

00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:48.840
Oh yeah! That is a sharp cup of coffee

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:50.900
But it's really good, it's really...

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:56.900
It's a little bit nutty, and very, black, roasted tasting

00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:59.860
And then additionally to go with the cup of coffee I got a pau

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:05.660
Which is a steamed bun and, I got the chicken version so there's chicken on the inside, let me...

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:07.300
Oh that's really hot!

00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:10.460
That is freshly steamed, let me break this open

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:13.620
Ooh, that is so, hot and fresh

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:17.540
And, oh you can smell that, I can smell some onions in there,

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:19.780
Smells like caramelized onions and chicken in there

00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:26.320
Oh that's good!

00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:29.680
Yeah that's like, tastes like caramelized onions

00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:34.760
It's a little bit sweet, kind of has that, that char siu kind of flavor

00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:37.760
But it's chicken and, mmm,

00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:40.580
That tastes good, especially with the bitter coffee

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:49.760
Having a couple cups of black coffee at this classic coffee shop

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:53.940
Is a great way to end the meal that we just had at the rib restaurant

00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:56.340
I really like this entire area of Jakarta, it's

00:11:56.780 --> 00:11:59.260
Kind of relaxing in comparison to other areas

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:00.220
And,

00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:05.100
I love the trees, and I love this coffee shop enviroment here so,

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:09.820
