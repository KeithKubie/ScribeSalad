00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:04.660
In May 1960, the Soviets shot down a U-2 spy
plane over Soviet airspace.

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:08.570
U-2s could fly at 70,000 feet (21.3km) but
apparently, that wasn’t high enough.

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:09.950
We needed to go higher.

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:13.799
To space!

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:20.190
So, the US needed a satellite that could take
pictures!

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:22.619
The thing is, a U-2 flight eventually lands…

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.230
The film in the cameras could be taken out
and developed.

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.880
If we launch a satellite, we needed a way
to get the film from space to intelligence

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:30.880
officers.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.130
This had never been done before.

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:39.320
They worked for years but eventually the CIA
launched the US’s first spy satellite, CORONA.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.230
CORONA’s first on-board camera was five
feet (1.2M) long, and could see things about

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.230
40 feet (12M) across.

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:45.230
Like a building…

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.940
It was America’s first imaging satellite,
and also the first US satellite program, ever.

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:55.590
Since it used film, CORONA would take pictures,
and drop the film in heavy buckets with parachutes.

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.620
The buckets would reenter the atmosphere,
and be caught by a “claw hook” hanging

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.890
off military cargo planes, or recovered by
ships after splashdown.

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.920
Assuming they didn’t sink (which happened).

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.110
This was the first time humans had recovered
anything sent to space.

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.910
And though crazy, it became hugely successful.

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:18.440
Pictures were taken of Soviet or Chinese missile
sites, which helped the US monitor and negotiate

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:19.910
Cold War treaties.

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:25.860
The first CORONA model Keyhole-1 only lasted
a day, but it gave way to lots more models.

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.200
Kodak made lighter film, engineers designed
better cameras and capsules...Eventually,

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.450
the engineers achieved 2 feet (61 cm) of resolution!

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.450
You could see people standing around military
bases all over the world.

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.311
Over the twelve years of the project, the
US launched over 120 Keyhole satellites, and

00:01:42.311 --> 00:01:47.760
took over 800,000 images We know all this,
because it was declassified in the 1990s.

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.680
President Clinton and Vice President Gore
released the images to the public to help

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:57.120
environmental efforts -- because these were
the oldest satellite maps of our planet!

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.590
Today, you can just go online and spy on a
zoo in North Korea.

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.600
You can look at strategic missile site ‘F’
on the border of Nebraska and Wyoming...

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.580
Which makes you wonder… what can the satellites
that are still classified see?

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.859

Imaging our planet changed how we do a lot of things, but on my

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.760
new Facebook show, How Close Are We, we're talking about taking pictures of the black hole

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.120
at the center of our galaxy. How close are we to seeing it? Find out on Facebook.

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.060
The link is in the description

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.040
Thanks for watching everyone!
