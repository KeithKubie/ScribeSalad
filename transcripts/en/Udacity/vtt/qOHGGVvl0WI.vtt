Bootstrap is big, and

00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:05.300
it has to be big to accommodate its impressive array of features.

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:08.910
That means that the files that make up the framework are actually pretty large.

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.620
This also means that for a small project like yours,

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:15.160
you aren't going to ever need or even use all the functionality.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.490
But, luckily, Bootstrap allows us to pick and

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.950
choose just the parts of the framework that we need,

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:23.560
making the CSS file that we include with our project significantly smaller.

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.910
To customize, we'll simply go up to the Customize button at the top menu, and

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:29.670
then we'll choose the parts that we need.

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.600
Let's go ahead and start by unchecking everything.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:37.720
For our project, we're going to need typography, grid system and modals.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.190
After we've checked those we'll scroll down and

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.940
when we get to the bottom of the screen we see this Compile and Download button.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.240
I want you to follow the same steps that we just went through and

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:47.170
click this button.

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.890
What type of file do you download when you press Compile and Download?

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.580
Is it a CSS file, an HTML file, or a ZIP file?
