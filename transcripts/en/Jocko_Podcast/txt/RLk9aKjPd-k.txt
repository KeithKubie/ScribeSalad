Speaker 1:          00:00          How do you balance the idea of checking the ego well in an interview scenario where you need to talk about yourself? Okay, so good question. I, I would say in that situation, and this is something that it's not just an interview situation where you're going to need to do that. I mean, you're dealing with your, your superiors, you know, throughout the course of your career, whatever that may be. You're constantly interacting with people and you, you're gonna want to make an impression. Uh, so I, I think one of the best ways to do this is instead of you speaking about why you're so awesome, just state facts of let's say accomplishments and let them speak for themselves. In other words, you know, you wouldn't want to say a,

Speaker 2:          00:51          yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:52          Yup. I am the best project manager in the entire world. Right. That's not, that sounds ego centric. You know, instead you'd say, uh, you know, I got this, we had a $38 million project, got it done on time, under budget, ahead of schedule. And when I got done with that, when they moved me to another project that was off track and we got that one back on schedule and back on track as well. So that's the kind of experience that I've had. And I'd love to bring that here to this company. Right. So you're not, you're not,

Speaker 1:          01:25          you know, there's a hint of, hey, this is what I did. I can get some stuff done. But you're not saying, listen, I'm better than the people you currently have, so you should hire me because I'm the best cause you don't want to do that. Um, and you know, so yeah, just build, think about it, you know, before you go in, how, what, what experience that you have represents the good qualities that you have. So then you can say, if they say, you know, how are you at meeting timelines? You don't say, I am perfect. I'm never late. I'm dope. You just say, you say, you say, well, you know, as far as meeting timelines, here's a bunch of projects that I got completed on time. The only one that I missed was one that we had to roll back because whatever that way you're actually showing a little bit more humility.

Speaker 1:          02:08          You're saying, hey, here's what happened. You're being logical about it and you'll speak into that. I actually got a good question that's similar to this one. Um, about what's the best way to interview people to see if they can be in a leadership position. And this is really hard. This is really hard cause it's really hard to interviews and working. I worked with all kinds of different companies and everybody always has, you know, hey, what's the best way to interview? And Man, I interviewed this guy and he seems so great. Or I interviewed this woman and she seemed incredible and or her paper looked great, you know, she looked great on paper and we hired her and she's a disaster or he's a disaster or whatever the case may be. Because, because there's people that are very good interviewers, right? I mean there's people that can interview well, they have the gift of Gab.

Speaker 1:          02:50          They can, they can bs their way through anything and make themselves sound good. So it can be really hard to identify if someone's good is actually going to be fit for a leadership position or really any position. So one of the things that that I always tell people to do is when you go into these, when you want to ask interview questions, ask them scenario based questions and say, okay, here's what's going on. You got these three people in your department and one of the people has come to you and said that they think there might be something illegal going on with the other two. What actions do you take? And, and you know, have a scenario built out that you can actually talk through and see where they'd go and see what their mindset is and see what they're going to develop as a plan and see how they would execute plans.

Speaker 1:          03:35          So it's a great way of figuring out how people think. And then you know, even that's not a guarantee because there's people that can, can navigate those types of answers as well. So you don't want that you can do is hire people on a little bit of a trial basis. And that can be difficult. Some situations where people are walking away from one job into another job and they're not going to do it on a 90 day trial basis. But when you do have that opportunity, it's a good thing to do as well. Um, but hey, so going back to the first question about keeping your ego in check in an interview, like I said, be confident but not cocky and let the facts of your experience speak for your, your abilities rather than beating your own chest.

Speaker 3:          04:19          Yeah. So it's almost like, I mean, correct me if I'm wrong here, so you s you essentially, even if you're talking yourself up, you just, you simply state the fact that you just state the fact, don't say your opinion about it. Like, just like how you were saying, please state the facts.

Speaker 1:          04:35          What I did, you know, we turn this project around, we got it on, on track and on budget and that, that's the type of, that's the type of experience that I have in those situations. Right.

Speaker 3:          04:44          Just like how you're saying, even if someone had got like an award to be the best, whatever sales right of the year, that right tells me that you're the best whatever of the year. And then, um, like to say that in a factual way would be, I was recognized as the best guy in the world. Instead of saying I'm the best guy in the world, who's my award to prove it, you know? So it's like you're seeing the fact that you were recognized, you know, not so much the fact fingered way of doing it. Stick to the facts, right. Just the facts, the facts.
