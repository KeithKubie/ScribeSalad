Cheating on your significant other is taboo in almost all cultures, yet somehow adds flavour

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:10.190
to the plot of movies and inspiration for countless songs about heartbreak. But why

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:14.419
do people cheat in the first place? Is there a science behind it?

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:18.500
Only about 3% of mammals are monogamous, meaning they stay with one partner their whole life

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.080
- and humans fall into this category. From an evolutionary perspective it creates an

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.949
advantage where one partner can protect the younglings while the other searches for food

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:32.579
and provides resources. But somehow, extrapair mating or cheating is a fairly common human

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:33.370
behaviour.

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:38.039
The gene coding for a dopamine receptor plays a key role in cheating for men and women.

00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:41.750
Sometimes call the ‘happy hormone’, it’s released after pleasurable activities like

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:47.859
exercise, eating food, and orgasming. And one study found that 50% of people who possess

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:52.960
the long allele variant of this gene had cheated on their partner, compared to only 22% of

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.109
people who have the short allele. The long allele participants also had a tendency to

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:02.690
be risk-takers and succumb to addictive behaviors such as alcoholism. Perhaps the phrase ‘once

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.390
a cheater, always a cheater’ may have a basis in reality.

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.960
Levels of the hormone vasopressin also play a role. Similar to oxytocin, which is sometimes

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.500
called the ‘cuddle hormone’ vasopressin can affect trust, empathy and social bonding.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.810
 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:26.140
increases the likelihood of it becoming monogamous! People with autism also have lower vasopressin

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:31.430
 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:36.560
over 7000 Finnish twins found that cheating women had a variant in the gene that codes

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.930
for a vasopressin receptor, further suggesting that low levels of vasopressin have an influence

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:42.659
on cheating.

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.420
Money may also be a factor; males who earn significantly more than their female counterpart

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.790
are more likely to cheat. But they’re also more likely to cheat on their wives if they

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:56.689
are stay-at-home dads. Only when both partners have similar earning potential d o the chances

00:01:56.689 --> 00:01:58.840
of either cheating decrease significantly.

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:04.130
Of course, many other life factors can lead to infidelity; from unresolved emotional issues,

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:10.080
baggage from past relationships and...excessive alcohol intoxication. Unfortunately same-sex

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.980
partnerships have not been studied enough to gain any clear insights, highlighting how

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.890
scientific research continues to exclude specific minority groups.

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.630
Either way, cheating is clearly based in biology and genetics for some of us, in spite of being

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.410
a monogamous species.

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.020

audible.com/asap. This week we wanted to recommend the book ‘SuperBetter’ where author and

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.970
game designer Jane McGonigal explains how to cultivate greater resiliency in everyday

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.720
life by using the mental strengths you apply to game-playing. You can get a free copy at
