00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.115
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:02.115 --> 00:00:05.110
- All right, so welcome.

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:08.080
I'm very, very happy to
have a chance to be here.

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.930
Now let's get
ourselves in the mood.

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:14.950
I'm going to talk about
pain and suffering today.

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:17.320
I hope I don't cause
you too much of that,

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.360
but we will see about
that, by the way.

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.110
So this is a famous painting
by Bruegel, Triumph of Death.

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:24.460
Some of you may know it.

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.530
If I talk about every
single painting I show,

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:28.240
I'll be here for three hours.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:29.557
So I won't do that.

00:00:29.557 --> 00:00:31.390
But I just want to point
out some very, very

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:32.980
important matters here.

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.300
So Bruegel did this
painting in 1562.

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.430
It's one of the-- it
was about in response

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:43.940
to the wave of plagues
that were ravaging Europe,

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.440
but also the religious wars.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:48.940
Catholics were
killing Protestants.

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.800
Protestants were
killing Catholics.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.142
It was a time of incredible
pain and suffering.

00:00:54.142 --> 00:00:56.350
In fact, I want to talk
about this a little bit later

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:57.400
in the talk today.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.880
But as Foucault points out
in Discipline and Punishment,

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.760
the punishments
were public then,

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.590
whereas the punishments
today are often

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.649
people are locked away
and being punished.

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:09.190
But one of the really
striking things

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:11.500
here is on the right
side is an army

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.300
of pretty much skeletons
walking forward holding a cross.

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.240
There were people being
grabbed at a table, who they're

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.065
in the midst of playing cards.

00:01:21.065 --> 00:01:23.690
One thing that really interests
me-- and again a lot of people,

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.320
even people who know something
the period don't really kind

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.280
of think enough
about, in my opinion--

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.420
is the way that people were
executed in the period.

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.120
Often if you were even just
caught like stealing something,

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.710
you were executed by
being put on a wheel.

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:40.210
And that meant
your arms and legs

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.420
were broken as your body
was put on the wheel.

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.780
You were out in the air
like this, obviously

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.000
in huge and terrible pain.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.660
It could take days to die.

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.360
Birds would pluck out your eyes.

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.280
Insects would eat your flesh.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.455
If your screams bothered
the people in your family,

00:01:59.455 --> 00:02:01.030
it was too bad.

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.550
Everyone had to
listen to you scream.

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:06.000
Are we having fun yet?

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.530
All right, now here's a
detail from this painting.

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.730
But again, I hope not to
cause you too much pain today.

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.770
But one of my interests
in this project

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.470
and one of my interests
in my life in general

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.845
is ideas about
pain and suffering.

00:02:23.845 --> 00:02:25.470
I'm quite interested
as a philosopher--

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.210
this is partly due
to my work in prison

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:31.390
and my commitment to what
my activist friends call

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.150
the transformation or
transcending rather

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:35.920
of the punishment paradigm.

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.160
But I'm interested in
how we human beings

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.790
think and respond to
our own suffering,

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.430
how we think or ignore
the suffering of others,

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.970
even the suffering
that we cause others,

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.520
and how we respond to
the suffering of others

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.290
or, in fact, ignore it.

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.140
Now a few years ago,
I was getting involved

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.990
in this anti-carceral activism.

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:02.590
But I realized in my day job
as a historian of philosophy

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.230
that no one had thought
seriously at all

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.380
about the history of the notion
of suffering and its relation

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:09.740
to philosophy.

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:13.090
So this project of mine,
"Feeling the Way to Truth--

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.130
Women, Reason, and
the Development

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:20.500
of Modern Philosophy," grew
out of that set of thoughts.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.290
Now basically, one of
the things I want to do

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.680
is I think that we need to
do a complete reconsideration

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.690
of history, of
philosophy, especially

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.779
the development of early
modern philosophy as it's told.

00:03:31.779 --> 00:03:33.820
And I think in this
audience, not a lot of people

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.710
probably know or
remember the details

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:39.220
of the development of modern
philosophy and the story

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:40.160
about that.

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:41.560
So let me remind you.

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.430
Now this is a parody.

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.730
It's called The Myth
of such and such.

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.280
But as a parody, it
would be only funny,

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.910
except for the fact that it
still remains pretty true.

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:53.620
So this is the parody.

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.410
And I hope you think
it's as amusing as I do,

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:58.210
but never mind.

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:01.120
I wish I had a Judi
Dench kind of voice here.

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.390
"It came to pass that the Earth
was without form and void.

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:06.730
And darkness covered
the face of the earth.

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:09.560
And the creators saw that
the darkness was evil.

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.050
And he spoke out
in the darkness,

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:13.300
saying, "Let there be light."

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:14.410
And there was light.

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:17.200
And he called the
light Renaissance.

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.540
And thus it was that the
continental rationalist

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:20.600
came to be.

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:24.190
So Descartes begat Spinoza,
and Spinoza begat Leibniz.

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.260
And thus it was that
the British empiricists

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.590
came to be so that Hobbes
begat Locke, and Locke begat

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.870
Berkeley, and
Berkeley begat Hume.

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:36.340
And then it was that there arose
the great sage of Koenigsberg,

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.540
the great Immanuel,
Immanuel Kant, who

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:42.250
though neither empiricist
nor rationalist

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:43.990
was likened to both.

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.600
He, it was, who combined
the eye of the scientist

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:48.670
with the mind of
the mathematician.

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:52.360
And this, too, the creator
saw and saw that it was good.

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.400
And he sent goodly
men and scholars

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.760
true to tell the story
wherever men should henceforth

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:00.610
gather to speak of sages past."

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:04.110
Now, this was
written in 1981 just

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:07.000
at the moment when people were
reconsidering this narrative.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.450
But it still is strikingly
embraced by many people

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:11.510
in many departments.

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:13.540
This is the kind of
history philosophy

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:15.390
that's typically told.

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:18.740
And if you doubt that, I just
point out that, for example,

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.950
the book on the right here,
The Norton Introduction

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:25.090
to Philosophy, was supposed to
be the great new introduction

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:26.290
to philosophy.

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:28.600
It's edited by very, very
serious philosophers.

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:30.790
In fact, one of them
is a friend of mine.

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:33.430
They talked to a lot of people
about what kind of introduction

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:35.110
to philosophy they needed.

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:37.960
It was published
three years ago.

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:43.240
And it contains 1,168 pages.

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.460
It starts with
Aristotle and Plato,

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:47.660
main topics in the
history of philosophy,

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:49.670
and works through those topics.

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:54.100
So it covers 2,400
years of philosophy.

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:57.730
But nowhere in any
of its pages is there

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:01.780
a mention of a person who
wrote in Arabic or a person--

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:05.110
a Jewish thinker, not
a single woman author

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:07.490
until the mid 20th century.

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:12.670
It entirely ignores anyone
except the canonical figures.

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:16.210
So it also, by the way, talks
about political philosophy

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:18.400
and the development of
political philosophy

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:21.310
and does not mention, as
most people don't, the very

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:25.900
important 19th century
authors who were former slaves

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:28.690
in the United States, who had
many really interesting things

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:32.140
to say, but again whose
voices have not been heard.

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:34.550
Now it's a really good
question, I think,

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:37.640
and I think for you folks,
like how did this come to pass?

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:41.320
How did this story
get to be told?

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:43.840
By the way, these two other
books are standard collections

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:44.390
as well.

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:44.960
Same thing.

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:46.190
Not a single woman.

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:47.680
A friend of mine
and I did an op-ed

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:50.860
in the Washington Post,
which really kind of got

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:53.560
their blood circulating.

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:55.210
And everyone now
is going to include

00:06:55.210 --> 00:07:00.010
a woman in the next edition
or two of these books.

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:02.160
All right, so how did
this story get set?

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.830
Well, in a way, it's
surprisingly easy.

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:07.810
Post-Kantian German
philosophers created a narrative

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:09.820
about the history
of philosophy that

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:13.090
highlighted what
they consider to be

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:16.000
the most important
philosophical questions.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.230
That is, they told a story that
conveniently led to themselves

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:22.180
as the heroes.

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:25.480
In his 1820 lectures on
the history of philosophy,

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:29.290
Hegel credits Descartes with
breaking holy with the past

00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:31.210
and setting the stage
for the greatness

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:33.580
of his own philosophy, writing--

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:35.150
this is astonishing.

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:39.130
He writes, "Germanic philosophy,
IE, modern philosophy

00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:41.230
begins with Descartes."

00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:46.360
And in his lectures
in the 1820s--

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:49.780
sorry 1847, rather,
Schopenhauer also

00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:52.180
insists that "our
excellent Descartes

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:55.780
is the instigator of the
subjective investigation

00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:58.690
and in this the father
of modern philosophy."

00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:02.560
So Hegel and then Schopenhauer
after him kind of told

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:04.630
the story about how
Descartes started

00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:08.020
something that ended with them.

00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:10.780
Now Kuno Fischer you
probably haven't heard of,

00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:14.500
but was an extremely popular
lecturer and philosopher

00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:15.230
in Germany.

00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:19.570
He was in Heidelberg, wrote
several volumes, including--

00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:22.802
this is this
multi-volume edition

00:08:22.802 --> 00:08:24.010
of The History of Philosophy.

00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:25.930
It's actually
really pretty good.

00:08:25.930 --> 00:08:27.940
No wonder he was
considered a good teacher.

00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:30.220
It tells this big, grand story.

00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:34.780
But according to him, Descartes
made a fundamental and complete

00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:36.730
renovation of philosophy.

00:08:36.730 --> 00:08:39.620
It's actually, it points,
unintentionally hilarious.

00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:44.200
He compares Descartes to
Faust, in Goethe's Faust,

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:49.240
who goes off into the world
and wants to discover nature

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:50.930
as opposed to read books.

00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:55.390
Now it strikes me
that that's not

00:08:55.390 --> 00:09:00.700
that complimentary to
Descartes, but never mind.

00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:03.910
Now also this story gets
going by these German thinkers

00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:07.030
in mid-late 19th century.

00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:10.600
And then it's picked up by very,
very serious and again very

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:13.210
well-educated and
thoughtful philosophers

00:09:13.210 --> 00:09:14.800
in France and Germany.

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:17.230
I'll just mention
Ernst Cassirer here,

00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:20.530
because he really was a
very, very fine philosopher.

00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:21.400
Ignore the German.

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:23.620
I was going to translate
it, but you can basically

00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:24.760
get the point.

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:29.320
The basic point is that the
17th century philosophy--

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:31.930
and you can see
underlined here systems.

00:09:31.930 --> 00:09:34.540
He wants to see 17th
century philosophy is

00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:35.605
a series of systems.

00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:42.430
He mentions here Descartes,
Malebranche, Spinoza, Leibniz,

00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:44.510
Bacon and Hobbes and so on.

00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:46.750
So again it's a
story of philosophy.

00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:49.570
It's a series of beads
on a string, all of which

00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:50.650
are great systems.

00:09:50.650 --> 00:09:53.500
I think I underlined the
bit that says system.

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:56.080
So he's interested in
the history of philosophy

00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:59.470
was set then as a
series of systems.

00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:02.490
Now you can imagine that
with this story told

00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:06.600
for over 150 years, this is
what philosophers taught.

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:08.430
This is what philosophers did.

00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:11.340
It's really hard to
shake this loose, right?

00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:12.820
But a lot of us these days--

00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:15.330
I'm by no means the
only one, in fact by no

00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:16.620
means the first one--

00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:20.310
are trying to think about
how to diversify philosophy.

00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:21.530
There's a number of websites.

00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:24.030
There's a lot of
good work being done.

00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:27.300
This is just a website
for a center I started.

00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:30.690
It has my three passions,
including rethinking justice.

00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:32.572
I'd love to tell you
about Aisha Elliot.

00:10:32.572 --> 00:10:33.780
She's one of my best friends.

00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:36.177
She was incarcerated
for 25 years,

00:10:36.177 --> 00:10:37.260
but never mind about that.

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:38.490
She is great.

00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:41.910
But I think I mentioned
to my Radcliffe colleagues

00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:46.200
last week about the Oxford
Philosophical Concepts.

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:48.330
And Meredith mentioned that.

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:51.120
But here are some of the
first volumes still out.

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:52.570
What I didn't
mention, by the way,

00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:54.630
is that the new volume
that's coming out

00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:57.040
is going to be the longest
of all of them yet.

00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:59.130
And that's the one
on evil, which I

00:10:59.130 --> 00:11:01.610
think is appropriate possibly.

00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:06.000
Now the New Oxford
Histories of Philosophy

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.090
are again attempting to
get very serious scholars

00:11:09.090 --> 00:11:12.060
to do editions of books that
have not been available.

00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:14.890
The first book in the series
is on Mexican philosophy,

00:11:14.890 --> 00:11:16.290
as Meredith mentioned.

00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:18.360
One of the next
ones coming along

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:22.490
is on Martin Delany, the man
whose photograph is the top.

00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:26.810
He's a black nationalist
riding in the mid 19th century

00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:30.180
considered to be really
brilliant political theorist.

00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:33.420
The Principia
Philosophiae is the title

00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:37.800
of a book by Anne Conway, the
philosopher I'm working on.

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:39.860
Some of us are also
doing a new translation

00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:41.430
in addition of her work.

00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:46.450
So there's a lot of work
coming along the way.

00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:48.550
Now back to my project.

00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:51.240
So one of the
things I hope I will

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:56.700
be able to do in my project
is to shake some things loose,

00:11:56.700 --> 00:12:00.260
especially shake lose the
relationship between early

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:04.710
modern philosophy and Descartes
and late medieval philosophy

00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:07.110
and also this nonsense
that Descartes

00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:10.050
created the subjective turn.

00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:12.420
So one of the things
I really hope to do

00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:16.920
is by killing these
sacred cows, for example,

00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:21.240
the sacred cow of Descartes
inventing the subjective turn

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:23.766
and the idea that--

00:12:23.766 --> 00:12:25.140
actually one thing
that interests

00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:27.300
me, I haven't mentioned
yet, is that we're

00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:29.790
supposed to believe that
the Enlightenment thinkers

00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:31.980
like Locke and
Rousseau and so on

00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:35.790
invented the notion of
equality and dignity and so on.

00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:39.150
In my opinion, it's quite clear
that these late medieval women

00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:41.310
I've been working
on-- it's all there.

00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:44.580
The roots of those ideas
are embedded very deeply

00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:46.680
into late medieval thought.

00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:49.920
Now obviously I can't tell
this whole story today.

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:51.390
But I want to tell you--

00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:53.710
I want to focus just
on one part of it,

00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:55.110
the part I thought
you might find

00:12:55.110 --> 00:13:01.400
most interesting, namely
the bit on suffering

00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:03.900
and particularly the
relationship between suffering

00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:05.250
and virtue.

00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:08.010
OK, suffering's deep background.

00:13:08.010 --> 00:13:08.970
Now I picked this.

00:13:08.970 --> 00:13:10.740
This is Zeus.

00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:12.720
He's a very manly man.

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:15.060
And so I thought it
would be good to use him

00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:19.350
as an example of an
ancient notion of virtue.

00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:23.190
The Latin virtus, the
original sense means strength.

00:13:23.190 --> 00:13:24.450
It means power.

00:13:24.450 --> 00:13:26.250
In fact, in 17th
century philosophy,

00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:30.870
for a very long time virtus
was used to talk about force.

00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:35.630
It was a word that was used
to think about physics.

00:13:35.630 --> 00:13:39.000
It came to be obviously
primarily related

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.060
to being virtuous as
we think of it now.

00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:47.040
But it's important to realize
that this notion of strength

00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:49.380
was basic.

00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:53.280
OK, now one of the obsessions
of ancient philosophers

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:56.130
Plato, Aristotle, and
so on was the idea

00:13:56.130 --> 00:13:59.430
of how to live a
proper life, how

00:13:59.430 --> 00:14:04.170
to live a virtuous life-- in
short, how to get life right.

00:14:04.170 --> 00:14:08.220
So Plato, for example, says,
"So long as we keep to the body,

00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:10.980
there is no chance of
our ever attaining truth,

00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:14.640
because the body fills us with
loves and desires and passions

00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:17.970
of all sorts so that we never
get an opportunity to think

00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:19.530
about anything at all."

00:14:19.530 --> 00:14:21.190
Now, this is the
Phaedo where Plato

00:14:21.190 --> 00:14:22.990
was particularly anti-body.

00:14:22.990 --> 00:14:24.990
It's less clear in
some other dialogues.

00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:26.820
But still, this is
the one that kind of

00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:28.990
was set and very influential.

00:14:28.990 --> 00:14:32.140
So let's just be clear
about what Plato is saying.

00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:35.000
He's saying that
reason, understanding

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:40.050
it's sometimes translated
as, has to deny the body.

00:14:40.050 --> 00:14:43.490
You cannot be tainted
by corporeal matters

00:14:43.490 --> 00:14:46.876
if you're going to attain to
and actually focus on eternal

00:14:46.876 --> 00:14:47.375
truths.

00:14:50.210 --> 00:14:52.010
So the only way to
get things right

00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:56.460
is to deny the body, to have
strength to overcome the body.

00:14:56.460 --> 00:14:58.610
So if you attend to
the body, then it

00:14:58.610 --> 00:15:01.370
follows that you
can't have virtue.

00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:03.170
You can't get things right.

00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:05.060
Your life is going
to suck, in short.

00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:10.070
Now interesting in
ancient literature,

00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:12.260
there's lots of
options for women.

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:14.330
And women can be agents.

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:15.740
There are goddesses.

00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:17.870
Medea is a demigod.

00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:22.100
She kills her children
before taken up to Heaven.

00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:24.416
Why was she taken up to
Heaven despite the fact

00:15:24.416 --> 00:15:25.790
that she has killed
her children?

00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:27.260
Because she is heroic.

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.000
She's defended her honor.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.150
By the way, Toni Morrison was
quite interested and influenced

00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:34.707
by her in writing Beloved.

00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:39.841
By the time we get to early--

00:15:39.841 --> 00:15:41.840
actually let me just skip
back here for a second

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:43.660
and just tell you.

00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:47.410
But already at this point,
already in ancient literature

00:15:47.410 --> 00:15:50.000
there is this tendency
to think of women

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.980
as not as fully capable of
being rational, as fully capable

00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:56.430
of being powerful.

00:15:56.430 --> 00:15:59.540
There are powerful
women, but it's still

00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:02.910
a problem to attain virtue.

00:16:02.910 --> 00:16:05.700
Now let's look at some
of the reasons for that.

00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:07.820
According to
Aristotle, the female

00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:10.640
is, as it were, a deformed male.

00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:14.930
According to the best medical
doctors in the period,

00:16:14.930 --> 00:16:17.870
medical philosophers,
because the female body

00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:20.360
has an imbalance of
fluids proven by the need

00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:24.190
to shed blood monthly,
it is incomplete.

00:16:24.190 --> 00:16:26.650
Galen, writing 600
years later, one

00:16:26.650 --> 00:16:28.540
of the most important
medical philosophy

00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:32.290
thinkers in medieval Europe,
puts it very clearly.

00:16:32.290 --> 00:16:34.120
"We shall look upon
the female state

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:36.670
as being a deformity,
the one which

00:16:36.670 --> 00:16:39.250
occurs in the ordinary
course of nature.

00:16:39.250 --> 00:16:42.520
Just as mankind is the most
perfect of all animals,

00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:46.580
so within mankind the man is
more perfect than the woman."

00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:48.340
In response to an
obvious question

00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:51.820
he's asked, why would the
creator purposely make

00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:56.170
half the human race imperfect
and as it were mutilated,

00:16:56.170 --> 00:16:59.830
the answer he gives, "He
made man complete and woman

00:16:59.830 --> 00:17:03.040
incomplete so that she
could be made complete

00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:05.800
through bearing children."

00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:08.810
Anne Clement of Alexandria,
a very important thinker--

00:17:08.810 --> 00:17:10.530
and again there's
hundreds of examples

00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:12.990
of this kind of saying--
puts it very succinctly.

00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:14.609
I really like this
way of putting it,

00:17:14.609 --> 00:17:16.500
as a way of
summarizing the view.

00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:20.490
"To do, to act, to be
an agent, to be virtuous

00:17:20.490 --> 00:17:22.020
is the mark of a man.

00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:24.933
To suffer is the
mark of a woman."

00:17:24.933 --> 00:17:26.849
And one of the things I
want to point out here

00:17:26.849 --> 00:17:30.880
is just how fluids
play an important role

00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:33.460
for these medical scientists.

00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:36.210
OK, now don't have
time to go into it.

00:17:36.210 --> 00:17:38.870
But one of the things that
we really need to remember

00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:42.080
is in early Christianity, there
were radical different ways

00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:44.120
of being a Christian.

00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:48.200
Lots of women were actually
out there reading and writing.

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:50.002
Elaine Pagels talks about this.

00:17:50.002 --> 00:17:52.460
There were lots of different
versions of being a Christian,

00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:54.980
including some that
actually, believe it or not,

00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:59.975
read Genesis as having Eve
be the good guy, so to speak.

00:17:59.975 --> 00:18:02.600
I can talk about that later with
people if they're interested.

00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:06.830
But it was a common
reading of Genesis.

00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:10.970
So there are many different
versions of early Christianity.

00:18:10.970 --> 00:18:13.610
And I think I would remind
you that there's two creation

00:18:13.610 --> 00:18:15.020
stories in Genesis.

00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:19.040
One has Adam and Eve being
created at the same time.

00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:21.710
It's the second creation
story, inconsistent clearly

00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:26.240
with the first, where Eve is
taken from the rib of Adam.

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:29.350
Now that in itself is
the one that got said.

00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:31.490
OK, so Augustine.

00:18:31.490 --> 00:18:34.220
By the fourth
century BC, the fate

00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:37.490
of women from medieval
Europe was sealed.

00:18:37.490 --> 00:18:41.030
This is mostly thanks to
the brilliant-- no denying--

00:18:41.030 --> 00:18:46.280
brilliant, prolific, and
utterly mean-spirited person

00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:48.170
Augustine of Hippo.

00:18:48.170 --> 00:18:50.220
The reading of the
Genesis and the gospels

00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:53.660
that Augustine helped
codify made it clear

00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:57.770
that women were physically
and morally inferior to men.

00:18:57.770 --> 00:19:02.300
The arguments for these claims
were straightforward enough.

00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:05.810
Eve's morality and
her moral inferiority

00:19:05.810 --> 00:19:09.830
follow from the fact that she
was created second and sinned

00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:11.000
first.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.540
Now notice the
image on the right.

00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:15.150
She's pulled out from--
she comes out of Adam's Eve

00:19:15.150 --> 00:19:17.750
and within like almost
the same temporal frame,

00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:19.700
right, is already
starting to sin.

00:19:22.510 --> 00:19:25.370
But also Eve's
physical inferiority,

00:19:25.370 --> 00:19:28.510
which is closely related
to her moral inferiority

00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:31.900
was to make her
morally perverse.

00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:34.750
So let's think about
that a little bit more.

00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:40.480
So the punishment that God
gave Eve involved her fertility

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:42.550
and in that sense
her body, which

00:19:42.550 --> 00:19:45.700
was supposed to lie at
the core of her nature.

00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:49.870
And given her inferiority, she
clearly needed ruling over,

00:19:49.870 --> 00:19:51.310
as we see in Genesis.

00:19:51.310 --> 00:19:53.680
"To the woman, he
said, I will greatly

00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:57.520
multiply your pain in
childbirth, in pain, you

00:19:57.520 --> 00:19:58.360
will"--

00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:01.210
sorry-- "in pain you will
bring forth children.

00:20:01.210 --> 00:20:04.300
Yet"-- and I underline--
"your desire will be

00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:05.260
for your husband.

00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:06.910
And he will rule over you."

00:20:06.910 --> 00:20:08.560
Again, if we had
more time to talk,

00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:11.080
it would be very interesting
to talk about the utter kind

00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:13.330
of horror of this.

00:20:13.330 --> 00:20:16.420
Eve's nature is to
desire her husband.

00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:18.370
But by following
her nature, she is

00:20:18.370 --> 00:20:21.460
forced to suffer in
childbirth and take on,

00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:25.150
as it were, the inferiority
of her female form.

00:20:25.150 --> 00:20:28.600
So women after the
fall are perverse.

00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:31.540
Their nature is perverse.

00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:35.200
For our purposes, it's important
that the punishment of women

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:37.600
is to be more rooted
in their bodies,

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:40.570
to be more inclined to
desire and to suffer.

00:20:40.570 --> 00:20:42.970
It followed, of
course, that they

00:20:42.970 --> 00:20:49.577
had no capacity for virtue,
at least not by themselves.

00:20:49.577 --> 00:20:51.035
And again, you know
these passages.

00:20:51.035 --> 00:20:52.850
I'll only read a couple.

00:20:52.850 --> 00:20:55.030
Women should remain
silent in churches.

00:20:55.030 --> 00:20:57.700
They are not allowed to speak,
but must be in submission,

00:20:57.700 --> 00:21:00.260
notice as the law says.

00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:03.110
Corinthians, women
should remain silent--

00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:03.620
sorry.

00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:08.270
Corinthians 11:2-9, "For I want
you to understand that Christ

00:21:08.270 --> 00:21:11.180
is the head of every man, and
the husband is the head of his

00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:15.770
wife, for a man ought not to
have his head veiled since he

00:21:15.770 --> 00:21:18.260
is the image and
reflection of God.

00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:21.020
But woman is a
reflection of man.

00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:23.270
Indeed, man was
not made for woman,

00:21:23.270 --> 00:21:25.500
but woman for man," and so on.

00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:28.220
Again, the same idea that
you find in Aristotle, which

00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:32.710
is woman is a deformed man.

00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:36.800
OK, nor did Augustine's--

00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:39.420
he pretty much
single-handedly, in my opinion,

00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:42.630
gave us this mean-spirited,
misogynistic version

00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:44.040
of Christianity.

00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:48.170
But he also, of course, was a
beautiful, wonderful writer.

00:21:48.170 --> 00:21:53.190
And his confessions written at
the end of the fourth century

00:21:53.190 --> 00:21:56.460
set the stage for all
of medieval Europe's

00:21:56.460 --> 00:22:00.360
kind of spiritual ways of
thinking about spirituality.

00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:02.520
In fact, some scholars
maintain that it's

00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:07.020
in Augustine we find the
first subjective turn,

00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:10.620
arguably whether it's like
Descartes, but still there.

00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:15.450
Now, so for of
medieval Europe then,

00:22:15.450 --> 00:22:19.800
these spiritual meditations,
the sort that Augustine set up,

00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:25.200
were the way-- these were the
way in which one meditated.

00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:26.990
Now, I don't want to
go into the details.

00:22:26.990 --> 00:22:29.550
This is like a part of
the philosophy of it all.

00:22:29.550 --> 00:22:32.130
But one of the things that--
the assumption here and one

00:22:32.130 --> 00:22:35.100
of the really important points
that underlies a lot of this

00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:38.970
is that in order to attain
virtue or to get life right,

00:22:38.970 --> 00:22:41.850
we must explore ourselves--
this was for Augustine--

00:22:41.850 --> 00:22:44.010
explore ourselves
and our beliefs.

00:22:44.010 --> 00:22:46.550
And this exploration
requires-- in fact,

00:22:46.550 --> 00:22:48.460
it's a whole long
list of things.

00:22:48.460 --> 00:22:52.590
These are some of the
more important ones.

00:22:52.590 --> 00:22:57.800
So after Augustine persuasively
argued that women were not

00:22:57.800 --> 00:23:01.640
capable of doing this sort
of thing, they didn't.

00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:02.970
They may have tried to do it.

00:23:02.970 --> 00:23:05.180
They may have actually
written lots of things.

00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:07.420
But we have no
evidence that they did.

00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:11.017
None of these materials, if they
tried to write or did write,

00:23:11.017 --> 00:23:11.600
have survived.

00:23:14.510 --> 00:23:17.480
But-- and this is where
I get really excited.

00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:20.090
And this is the beginning
of my own new work,

00:23:20.090 --> 00:23:24.800
is that something really odd
happened in the 12th century,

00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:27.500
actually between the
12th and 14th centuries.

00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:31.190
Women began to write
and even to teach.

00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:34.450
You can tell they did
because prominent men started

00:23:34.450 --> 00:23:35.360
protesting.

00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:37.100
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:39.200
The chancellor of the
University of Paris

00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:42.580
writes, "the female sex is
forbidden to teach in public.

00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:46.190
All women's teachings,
particularly formal teaching

00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:50.030
by word and by writing, is to be
held suspect unless it has been

00:23:50.030 --> 00:23:54.620
diligently examined and
much more fully than men's.

00:23:54.620 --> 00:23:56.030
The reason is clear.

00:23:56.030 --> 00:23:59.330
Following Eve's legacy,
women are easily

00:23:59.330 --> 00:24:03.110
seduced and determined
seducers and because it is not

00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:06.290
proved that they are
witnesses to divine grace."

00:24:06.290 --> 00:24:10.030
This last bit is really
insulting, right?

00:24:10.030 --> 00:24:14.150
OK, so how could
this problem arise?

00:24:14.150 --> 00:24:17.540
How could it arise that women
were suddenly in a position

00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:20.450
to be writing things
and be taken seriously

00:24:20.450 --> 00:24:23.240
and be taken so seriously
that the chancellor

00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:27.400
of the bloody University of
Paris has to complain about it?

00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:33.530
There was, in short, a radical
shift in religious modes.

00:24:33.530 --> 00:24:36.710
Beginning in the 12th century
and developing steadily

00:24:36.710 --> 00:24:41.060
over the next few, there was
what's called a new genre--

00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:43.190
a new genre of
spiritual meditative

00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:47.690
exercises with the express
goal of teaching readers

00:24:47.690 --> 00:24:51.500
how to identify with
the suffering of Christ.

00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:53.840
The shift in
religious practices--

00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:55.420
and it was radical--

00:24:55.420 --> 00:24:59.150
is what scholars call
effective meditations.

00:24:59.150 --> 00:25:02.150
This is what one scholar
writes about this.

00:25:02.150 --> 00:25:05.030
The meditations "ask the
readers to imagine themselves

00:25:05.030 --> 00:25:07.580
present at the scenes
of Christ's suffering

00:25:07.580 --> 00:25:11.210
and to perform compassion
for that suffering victim

00:25:11.210 --> 00:25:13.680
in a private trauma
of the heart.

00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:15.770
These were crafted to
teach their readers,

00:25:15.770 --> 00:25:21.980
through iterative affective
performance, how to feel."

00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:22.940
So I think it's--

00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:25.550
these images are
really incredible.

00:25:25.550 --> 00:25:27.650
This image is, in fact, by--

00:25:27.650 --> 00:25:31.070
this is a book by a professor
here at Harvard, Jeffrey

00:25:31.070 --> 00:25:35.330
Hamburger, who discovered
this cache of art

00:25:35.330 --> 00:25:40.430
by women in a monastery and
really basically painting

00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:43.220
about their religious
and spiritual lives.

00:25:43.220 --> 00:25:44.470
Notice the blood.

00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:48.960
Notice the kind of blood
and guts, so to speak,

00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:51.830
of this image on the left.

00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:56.960
On the right is an image
from the early 16th century.

00:25:56.960 --> 00:26:00.860
But you see suddenly-- and this
has not been true before around

00:26:00.860 --> 00:26:02.570
1100--

00:26:02.570 --> 00:26:06.590
Christ is represented
as a suffering entity.

00:26:06.590 --> 00:26:10.284
He's not the King of Heaven
anymore with the crown on.

00:26:10.284 --> 00:26:12.950
This is kind of like, this is my
imitation of the Christ before.

00:26:12.950 --> 00:26:16.100
It's like la-dee-da, if
you know the end of Monty

00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:18.200
Python and the Holy Grail.

00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:20.990
But he is a
passionate human being

00:26:20.990 --> 00:26:24.550
who has suffered for
the sake of humanity.

00:26:24.550 --> 00:26:28.390
This is an example of just like
one of hundreds of examples.

00:26:28.390 --> 00:26:30.430
But not only did
women write, women

00:26:30.430 --> 00:26:33.640
told people to make
books for them.

00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:35.470
This is Mary going--

00:26:35.470 --> 00:26:37.320
this is made by, in
fact, a friend of mine

00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:38.290
who's working on this.

00:26:38.290 --> 00:26:41.090
This is meditations that
were written for the Poor

00:26:41.090 --> 00:26:46.330
Clares, the female version
of St. Francis women,

00:26:46.330 --> 00:26:49.620
so to speak after
Clare, his friend.

00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:52.420
And they asked that a
meditation be written

00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:55.570
showing Mary going out and
preaching and giving money

00:26:55.570 --> 00:26:57.700
and so on and aid to the poor.

00:26:57.700 --> 00:27:03.340
I made the mistake of
not copying a folio which

00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:04.340
is really wonderful.

00:27:04.340 --> 00:27:07.740
In this same volume,
there is actually

00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:11.590
a drawing of Jesus kind
of sitting at the table.

00:27:11.590 --> 00:27:13.060
And Mary's washing dishes.

00:27:13.060 --> 00:27:16.390
She's made dinner for him.

00:27:16.390 --> 00:27:19.840
There is one of my favorite
people that I am working on

00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:22.110
and kind of just discovered
in the past few years

00:27:22.110 --> 00:27:25.120
is this wonderful person,
Julian of Norwich.

00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:27.040
And this is-- I show
this, because she

00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:28.810
was what's called an anchoress.

00:27:28.810 --> 00:27:31.570
Many women in this period
would anchor themselves,

00:27:31.570 --> 00:27:34.930
would enclose themselves in
a small part of a church.

00:27:34.930 --> 00:27:38.410
They basically
lived in this room.

00:27:38.410 --> 00:27:40.770
But they also-- many of
them had little windows

00:27:40.770 --> 00:27:43.872
and would actually be
spiritual advisors to people.

00:27:43.872 --> 00:27:45.080
In fact, a couple of people--

00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:46.870
a couple of these
women became famous

00:27:46.870 --> 00:27:50.405
as kind of the therapists,
the shrinks for the town.

00:27:50.405 --> 00:27:52.780
People would come up and talk
to them about their husband

00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:55.660
or problem child.

00:27:55.660 --> 00:27:58.040
But notice what Julian says.

00:27:58.040 --> 00:28:01.480
"Just because I am a
woman, must I therefore

00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:05.560
believe that I must not tell
you about the goodness of God

00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:09.250
when I saw his wish that
it should be known?"

00:28:09.250 --> 00:28:10.930
So this is the argument.

00:28:10.930 --> 00:28:13.600
God was showing them truths.

00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:16.240
And it was their obligation
to share the truths

00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:17.830
that God was showing them.

00:28:17.830 --> 00:28:20.380
And how was God showing
them these truths?

00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:22.470
God was showing
them these truths

00:28:22.470 --> 00:28:27.460
by their capacity to identify
with the suffering of Jesus,

00:28:27.460 --> 00:28:30.970
the suffering of Mary, the
suffering of other people

00:28:30.970 --> 00:28:34.090
so they could actually
take on the insides

00:28:34.090 --> 00:28:35.890
of these spiritual beings.

00:28:35.890 --> 00:28:37.000
Notice what she says.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.010
And this is common.

00:28:39.010 --> 00:28:43.780
"I wanted to suffer with him
and with others who loved him.

00:28:43.780 --> 00:28:48.620
And I wanted his pains to be
my pains with compassion."

00:28:48.620 --> 00:28:51.190
So one of the things that
is really striking to me

00:28:51.190 --> 00:28:55.960
when I first understood this
is compasio, to suffer with,

00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:57.910
was invented in this period.

00:28:57.910 --> 00:29:01.990
The notion of compassion
was not a notion

00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:04.480
that was prominent and current.

00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:09.280
So suddenly the idea, the
goal to be compassionate,

00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:12.280
to suffer with people
becomes prominent.

00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:17.310
Now again, if I talked about
all the art and images,

00:29:17.310 --> 00:29:18.220
I'd be here too long.

00:29:18.220 --> 00:29:19.849
And I may be here
too long anyway.

00:29:19.849 --> 00:29:22.390
In fact, somebody is going to
have to tell me about the time.

00:29:22.390 --> 00:29:26.530
But this pieta is one of
the most striking objects

00:29:26.530 --> 00:29:27.670
I've ever seen.

00:29:27.670 --> 00:29:30.100
One of the things I
learned is that pietas--

00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:31.750
who knew-- I didn't--

00:29:31.750 --> 00:29:34.660
that didn't exist until 1300.

00:29:34.660 --> 00:29:37.600
And they began--
probably the first pietas

00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:41.500
were created by women in
the Rhineland of Germany.

00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:45.280
It was a function of kind
of women wanting to in a way

00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:48.030
see themselves in God.

00:29:48.030 --> 00:29:51.430
So what's striking to me
about this work in my--

00:29:51.430 --> 00:29:53.610
a little art class sometimes
I teach at Columbia--

00:29:53.610 --> 00:29:55.600
it's art appreciation really.

00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:59.660
What's striking to me about this
is the focus is not on Jesus.

00:29:59.660 --> 00:30:00.760
Jesus is dead.

00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:02.470
Sure, he suffered.

00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:07.870
But the focus is on Mary at
the kind of moment of her loss

00:30:07.870 --> 00:30:11.350
and the horror of the
recognition of her misery.

00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:14.250
So we see him through her.

00:30:14.250 --> 00:30:18.760
But she is the primary
conduit of our suffering.

00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:20.740
We compasio.

00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:23.650
We are compassionate with her.

00:30:23.650 --> 00:30:25.950
Now one of the striking
things that these women did--

00:30:25.950 --> 00:30:29.390
and actually Caroline Bynum
first wrote about this.

00:30:29.390 --> 00:30:32.340
She has this beautiful book
called Jesus as Mother.

00:30:32.340 --> 00:30:33.820
And I remember
reading that title

00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:36.740
and thinking like, this
is too weird for words.

00:30:36.740 --> 00:30:40.210
But basically what these women
were particularly inclined

00:30:40.210 --> 00:30:41.920
to do and men did,
too-- in fact,

00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:45.940
this tradition began
in monasteries by men--

00:30:45.940 --> 00:30:49.870
is to think of Jesus
as a mother who suckled

00:30:49.870 --> 00:30:52.540
the breast of his children.

00:30:52.540 --> 00:30:56.070
And the head of monasteries
saw themselves in the same way.

00:30:56.070 --> 00:30:59.170
It's kind of transgender
goodness knows what.

00:30:59.170 --> 00:31:04.060
Now this is a book from 1616
I've found searching around.

00:31:04.060 --> 00:31:05.010
And look at the top.

00:31:05.010 --> 00:31:06.250
This is by the Jesuits.

00:31:06.250 --> 00:31:08.320
This is probably-- I
can't remember actually

00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:09.400
the details now.

00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:11.520
This is probably Ignatius.

00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:12.470
And what's he doing?

00:31:12.470 --> 00:31:13.990
He's lactating.

00:31:13.990 --> 00:31:15.340
You see his breast?

00:31:15.340 --> 00:31:16.990
And actually it's
very interesting

00:31:16.990 --> 00:31:20.780
how he is kind of female, right?

00:31:20.780 --> 00:31:23.330
You don't see-- there's
no indication of a penis.

00:31:23.330 --> 00:31:27.770
So he is lactating,
sending his milk out,

00:31:27.770 --> 00:31:32.510
so that his children might
suckle and follow him.

00:31:32.510 --> 00:31:35.570
It's pretty wild stuff.

00:31:35.570 --> 00:31:40.370
OK, so let's rethink, then, the
meditative spiritual exercises.

00:31:40.370 --> 00:31:43.560
Everything we said
before is still true.

00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:45.780
But we have this
new requirement.

00:31:45.780 --> 00:31:50.030
The virtue seeker now
must analyze, categorize,

00:31:50.030 --> 00:31:52.410
and understand her feelings.

00:31:52.410 --> 00:31:55.170
That's what these affective
meditations are about.

00:31:55.170 --> 00:31:57.905
They're to teach you how
to feel in the right way.

00:31:57.905 --> 00:32:00.280
It's there to teach you-- so
at first you're sympathetic,

00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:01.800
but then you have
to become more so.

00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:05.480
You have to focus so much on
the suffering of the people who

00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:08.900
have suffered for you that
you actually sometimes bleed

00:32:08.900 --> 00:32:10.010
yourself.

00:32:10.010 --> 00:32:14.430
In fact, you know people know
about Saint Francis's stigmata.

00:32:14.430 --> 00:32:18.920
Women had had them for a century
before Saint Francis got them.

00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:23.390
They would suddenly
spontaneously bleed as it were.

00:32:23.390 --> 00:32:25.250
So you had to--

00:32:25.250 --> 00:32:28.160
the truth seeker had to analyze,
categorize, and understand

00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:29.960
her feelings.

00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:34.670
They had to suffer with Jesus
and other religious figures.

00:32:34.670 --> 00:32:38.600
And the meditator, in short,
had to feel their way to virtue.

00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:43.220
Suddenly, the feeling was
primary and important.

00:32:43.220 --> 00:32:47.390
Again from Julian, "For if
I look solely at myself,

00:32:47.390 --> 00:32:48.800
I am really nothing.

00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:51.080
But as one of
humankind in general,

00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:54.660
I am oneness of love
with all others.

00:32:54.660 --> 00:32:58.850
For upon this oneness of
love depends the life of all,

00:32:58.850 --> 00:33:03.050
for God is all that is good, and
God has made all that is made,

00:33:03.050 --> 00:33:05.330
and God loves all
that he has made."

00:33:10.730 --> 00:33:13.160
Here are some other
passages I can have you

00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:17.060
kind of look at as
you're going along here.

00:33:17.060 --> 00:33:20.450
I want to, though, talk
a little bit about how

00:33:20.450 --> 00:33:23.210
kind of astonishing this is.

00:33:23.210 --> 00:33:24.950
So what do we have here?

00:33:24.950 --> 00:33:28.070
In the past, in the ancient
notion of women and women's

00:33:28.070 --> 00:33:32.600
bodies, to suffer, to be related
to your body, to have affect

00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:36.510
was to guarantee that
you couldn't find virtue.

00:33:36.510 --> 00:33:40.340
And now suddenly that's
been turned on it's head.

00:33:40.340 --> 00:33:42.680
And historians of
the period talk

00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:45.010
a lot about why this happened.

00:33:45.010 --> 00:33:48.110
You can do a kind of good
Marxist historical reading

00:33:48.110 --> 00:33:49.070
of this.

00:33:49.070 --> 00:33:52.700
Enormous suffering,
suddenly actually--

00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:55.300
long story about that.

00:33:55.300 --> 00:33:57.390
So there were social
and economic reasons

00:33:57.390 --> 00:33:58.380
for this surely.

00:33:58.380 --> 00:34:03.480
But the fact is that there
was this effective radical

00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:04.800
transition, this change.

00:34:09.850 --> 00:34:12.630
So that having a capacity to
think through your feelings,

00:34:12.630 --> 00:34:16.500
to analyze your feelings,
to worry about your feelings

00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:23.880
was itself the means to
think about and understand

00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:26.310
fundamental truths
about the world, right?

00:34:26.310 --> 00:34:29.130
So suddenly note,
reason is important.

00:34:29.130 --> 00:34:31.679
It's not as if reason
doesn't come into play.

00:34:31.679 --> 00:34:33.600
You have to think through
arguments sometimes.

00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:35.880
And at the end, for some
of these meditations,

00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:40.139
you actually do have to kind
of think through and reason

00:34:40.139 --> 00:34:42.780
about the nature of God.

00:34:42.780 --> 00:34:45.310
So theology still plays a role.

00:34:45.310 --> 00:34:47.699
But you have this punctuated.

00:34:47.699 --> 00:34:50.070
So it's philosophy and
reason, as it were,

00:34:50.070 --> 00:34:53.440
punctuated by
analysis of feeling.

00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:56.909
In fact, during the troubadours,
the kind of love poetry that

00:34:56.909 --> 00:34:59.880
was written in the so-called
12th century Renaissance,

00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:00.960
many people--

00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:04.260
there's actually some
very interesting cases

00:35:04.260 --> 00:35:08.430
where people say,
I felt all of these

00:35:08.430 --> 00:35:10.830
complicated and
conflicting ways,

00:35:10.830 --> 00:35:12.950
but couldn't
understand my feelings.

00:35:12.950 --> 00:35:15.180
And within a 20
or 30-year period,

00:35:15.180 --> 00:35:17.750
people were thinking
about naming feelings,

00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:20.250
naming emotions, naming affects.

00:35:20.250 --> 00:35:24.150
And women have a very
important role to play in that.

00:35:24.150 --> 00:35:29.220
So let's just focus a little
bit on what Julian says here.

00:35:29.220 --> 00:35:33.130
God shows her "all
that is made."

00:35:33.130 --> 00:35:34.720
Now this is not--

00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:36.880
this is philosophy.

00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:38.690
This is metaphysics.

00:35:38.690 --> 00:35:40.990
God is letting
her know something

00:35:40.990 --> 00:35:43.180
about the nature of reality.

00:35:43.180 --> 00:35:45.670
Also notice that when--

00:35:45.670 --> 00:35:47.260
people talk about
Julian in this way.

00:35:47.260 --> 00:35:48.580
And it's fascinating.

00:35:48.580 --> 00:35:51.850
What she's doing is, as
it were, reading her body.

00:35:51.850 --> 00:35:53.140
She suffers.

00:35:53.140 --> 00:35:56.260
She suffers for the
suffering of other people.

00:35:56.260 --> 00:35:59.760
She thinks about suffering
as something that she does

00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:01.810
and she thinks other people do.

00:36:01.810 --> 00:36:06.260
So there's a way in which she's
reading her body and from that.

00:36:06.260 --> 00:36:07.090
And she says, here.

00:36:07.090 --> 00:36:09.430
"And when the bodily
vision stopped,

00:36:09.430 --> 00:36:12.980
the spiritual vision remained
in my understanding."

00:36:12.980 --> 00:36:14.890
So it's not just about the body.

00:36:14.890 --> 00:36:17.710
It's about the body
and the possibility

00:36:17.710 --> 00:36:19.810
for the body and
the truths that it

00:36:19.810 --> 00:36:22.330
comes to in thinking
about feelings

00:36:22.330 --> 00:36:30.250
and so on to produce ideas that
the understanding can embrace.

00:36:30.250 --> 00:36:33.430
Her insights, she says, are
"universal and addressed"--

00:36:33.430 --> 00:36:36.810
notice-- "to all,
because we are all one."

00:36:36.810 --> 00:36:39.150
Again, I can't focus
on this too much here.

00:36:39.150 --> 00:36:40.690
But she says this
and this woman,

00:36:40.690 --> 00:36:42.760
this 17th century
woman philosopher

00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:44.590
Anne Conway I'm working on.

00:36:44.590 --> 00:36:46.930
These women-- especially Conway.

00:36:46.930 --> 00:36:51.040
It's clear that all human
beings are capable of dignity.

00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:54.040
You don't have to be a
Christian to come to truth.

00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:56.110
She says the Jews, Turks--

00:36:56.110 --> 00:36:57.370
that is, the Muslims--

00:36:57.370 --> 00:36:58.960
and Christians
can all understand

00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:00.490
what's true about the world.

00:37:00.490 --> 00:37:03.460
I mean, she's devoted
and committed to an idea

00:37:03.460 --> 00:37:07.180
that all human beings are
capable of loving one another.

00:37:07.180 --> 00:37:10.450
And then finally Julian,
"If I look solely at myself,

00:37:10.450 --> 00:37:13.600
I am really nothing, but as
one of humankind in general,

00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:17.170
I am openness of love with
all others," and so on.

00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:25.380
But there are some
who disagreed.

00:37:25.380 --> 00:37:27.870
And Aquinas, for example--

00:37:27.870 --> 00:37:29.320
it's very interesting.

00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:32.610
There's a whole discussion
in Aquinas and Scotus based

00:37:32.610 --> 00:37:35.370
on the quotation from Psalm.

00:37:35.370 --> 00:37:39.930
"The just man will rejoice
when he sees divine vengeance."

00:37:39.930 --> 00:37:45.450
And I threw this in, but Aquinas
is clear about the fact that

00:37:45.450 --> 00:37:48.480
when the blessed are in heaven--
so you're lucky enough to get

00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:49.690
to heaven--

00:37:49.690 --> 00:37:52.380
one of the joys
you feel in heaven

00:37:52.380 --> 00:37:57.660
is hearing the screams
of the people in hell.

00:37:57.660 --> 00:37:59.520
"They do rejoice
in the suffering

00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:03.930
of the damned as a manifestation
of divine justice."

00:38:03.930 --> 00:38:07.910
So not everyone
agreed with compasio.

00:38:07.910 --> 00:38:10.410
OK, so the metaphysics of love.

00:38:10.410 --> 00:38:12.030
I haven't decided
what to call this.

00:38:12.030 --> 00:38:14.670
My students want me to call
it the metaphysics of love.

00:38:14.670 --> 00:38:17.360
It sounds a little
bit too 1960s to me,

00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:18.570
but maybe I'll go with that.

00:38:18.570 --> 00:38:20.220
I can hear from people later on.

00:38:20.220 --> 00:38:22.710
But it's surely a
metaphysics of affect.

00:38:22.710 --> 00:38:24.420
So one of the major
parts of my book--

00:38:24.420 --> 00:38:27.060
and I'm not going to talk
about this any more than I have

00:38:27.060 --> 00:38:27.930
today--

00:38:27.930 --> 00:38:30.870
is to talk about the metaphysics
that these people are committed

00:38:30.870 --> 00:38:34.710
to, of an underlying
vital divine force

00:38:34.710 --> 00:38:38.880
that all human beings have,
that suffering produces

00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:41.880
an analysis of one's feelings
and one's, as it were,

00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:43.710
love for other human beings.

00:38:43.710 --> 00:38:46.950
God has made the world
so that all human beings

00:38:46.950 --> 00:38:49.930
stand in sympathetic
harmony to one another.

00:38:49.930 --> 00:38:52.110
And if you understand
that, then you've

00:38:52.110 --> 00:38:55.410
understood something fundamental
about God and about the nature

00:38:55.410 --> 00:38:56.400
of the world.

00:38:56.400 --> 00:39:00.960
This mosaic from the
12th century in Rome

00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:08.370
is a really nice example of
this interconnection of things.

00:39:08.370 --> 00:39:12.250
Now in closing, I want
to make two points.

00:39:12.250 --> 00:39:14.490
One is I have a
bit of a problem.

00:39:14.490 --> 00:39:16.590
If I want to kind of
rethink and rewrite

00:39:16.590 --> 00:39:19.980
the history of philosophy,
which I do, I can, I think,

00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:23.580
very easily show that these
women had a major force

00:39:23.580 --> 00:39:27.330
and played a major role in the
influence and the development

00:39:27.330 --> 00:39:27.930
of ideas.

00:39:27.930 --> 00:39:29.240
No problem.

00:39:29.240 --> 00:39:31.710
The problem is the
way they wrote.

00:39:31.710 --> 00:39:34.230
So this is from Marie
de Gournay, a very

00:39:34.230 --> 00:39:36.490
famous in her time feminist.

00:39:36.490 --> 00:39:40.170
She was a skeptic, really out
there, radical, much hated.

00:39:40.170 --> 00:39:44.290
She was kind of trolled
in the early 17th century.

00:39:44.290 --> 00:39:45.930
"Blessed are you,
reader, if you do not

00:39:45.930 --> 00:39:49.710
belong to the sex of those who
are deprived a proper education

00:39:49.710 --> 00:39:53.400
so that ignorance, slavery, and
the capacity to play the fool

00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:56.430
are established as
woman's only happiness."

00:39:56.430 --> 00:39:58.710
Now I'm really taken
by this, because one

00:39:58.710 --> 00:40:02.490
of the problems with Julian and
Teresa of Avila, somebody else

00:40:02.490 --> 00:40:03.600
I work on--

00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:05.190
did I mention them before?

00:40:05.190 --> 00:40:06.760
Yeah, here are
the three people--

00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:09.950
here are the other people I'm
going to work on in the book.

00:40:09.950 --> 00:40:11.700
There might be
somebody else involved.

00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:14.130
But all of these
women are very--

00:40:14.130 --> 00:40:17.250
except for Anne Conway, who's
writing in the 17th century--

00:40:17.250 --> 00:40:19.530
are very inclined to
say, I'm just a woman.

00:40:19.530 --> 00:40:21.090
And what do I know?

00:40:21.090 --> 00:40:24.900
But here and then they zap you
with some interesting insight.

00:40:24.900 --> 00:40:28.590
But what worries me is the
fact that their writings, then,

00:40:28.590 --> 00:40:31.110
are not as philosophically
straightforward.

00:40:31.110 --> 00:40:34.860
They practice a genre that
lots of philosophers and people

00:40:34.860 --> 00:40:37.740
who think about philosophy
seriously don't kind of

00:40:37.740 --> 00:40:39.270
appreciate very much.

00:40:39.270 --> 00:40:42.240
But let me tell you
in a couple minutes

00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:43.350
about some work I've done.

00:40:43.350 --> 00:40:46.950
I've already written about
this, but again about Descartes.

00:40:46.950 --> 00:40:48.750
Now when we think
about Descartes,

00:40:48.750 --> 00:40:51.840
we think about
that he's supposed

00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:54.360
to have invented the
self-reflecting individual,

00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:54.990
right?

00:40:54.990 --> 00:40:57.810
And that happens, the
so-called cogito argument.

00:40:57.810 --> 00:40:59.640
I think, I am--

00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:00.650
I think, therefore I am.

00:41:00.650 --> 00:41:04.570
In the discourse, it's, I
think I am, comma, I am,

00:41:04.570 --> 00:41:06.480
in the Meditations.

00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:09.540
But this begins with the
evil deceiver argument.

00:41:09.540 --> 00:41:12.720
And everyone who's looked around
for the source of Descartes'

00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:16.500
meditations have been
stunned and then amazed

00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:20.060
that there seems to be no
sources for this, right?

00:41:20.060 --> 00:41:22.830
They've looked at Ignatius,
because Descartes was

00:41:22.830 --> 00:41:25.800
educated in a Jesuit school.

00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:28.530
And Ignatius-- they all
did spiritual meditations.

00:41:28.530 --> 00:41:31.770
And there's nothing in
the spiritual exercises

00:41:31.770 --> 00:41:34.830
that Ignatius of Loyola
wrote or anything

00:41:34.830 --> 00:41:36.660
like Descartes' meditations.

00:41:36.660 --> 00:41:39.390
So they looked around for
a great man as the source.

00:41:39.390 --> 00:41:42.550
But nobody looked around
for a great woman.

00:41:42.550 --> 00:41:44.610
In all of some of
the major arguments

00:41:44.610 --> 00:41:45.970
in Descartes' meditations--

00:41:45.970 --> 00:41:47.750
I have a paper on this--

00:41:47.750 --> 00:41:49.620
are all in Teresa.

00:41:49.620 --> 00:41:53.130
And moreover, Teresa
was a rock star.

00:41:53.130 --> 00:41:54.150
Everyone knew her.

00:41:54.150 --> 00:41:56.050
The Jesuits loved her.

00:41:56.050 --> 00:41:57.660
Now, I can't go
into the details.

00:41:57.660 --> 00:42:01.604
But here's an account
of the deceived--

00:42:01.604 --> 00:42:03.270
many, many books were
written about her.

00:42:03.270 --> 00:42:06.510
And many books were summarizing
her spiritual meditations.

00:42:06.510 --> 00:42:08.730
But just like
Descartes' meditations,

00:42:08.730 --> 00:42:12.010
she thinks that she's making
some headway towards the truth.

00:42:12.010 --> 00:42:14.640
And then the devil comes out
and goes boogie, boogie, boogie.

00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:18.630
Let me take your attention
off your meditative exercises.

00:42:18.630 --> 00:42:19.800
And then look what she does.

00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:22.830
Like Descartes'
meditator, she finally

00:42:22.830 --> 00:42:27.090
decides to analyze herself
and her subjective truths

00:42:27.090 --> 00:42:28.550
in the right kind of way.

00:42:28.550 --> 00:42:30.820
And the poor dejected
devils have to we.

00:42:30.820 --> 00:42:34.130
I kind of even feel sorry
for this first devil here.

00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:41.740
Now Beyonce.

00:42:41.740 --> 00:42:44.740
You can't have a lecture about
divinity without including

00:42:44.740 --> 00:42:46.000
Beyonce.

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:47.200
So why Beyonce?

00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:52.230
Because Teresa was the
Beyonce of the 17th century.

00:42:52.230 --> 00:42:56.140
You might not like her, but
you could not ignore her.

00:42:56.140 --> 00:42:58.300
And you had to admire her.

00:42:58.300 --> 00:43:01.630
And I say that
because her books--

00:43:01.630 --> 00:43:04.390
I mean, all of her writings
originally in Spanish

00:43:04.390 --> 00:43:08.690
were translated into Latin and
were spread all over Europe.

00:43:08.690 --> 00:43:10.600
Here's someone-- again,
I don't have time

00:43:10.600 --> 00:43:11.740
to read all this stuff.

00:43:11.740 --> 00:43:14.400
But here's someone
who says, the elements

00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:20.080
of the most profound philosophy
are explained in your text.

00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:22.960
But here-- and this is
part of my problem now--

00:43:22.960 --> 00:43:25.510
because she was so
damn clear at times,

00:43:25.510 --> 00:43:28.330
because she was so
damn moving at times,

00:43:28.330 --> 00:43:30.340
many people thought
that she must

00:43:30.340 --> 00:43:33.540
be in league with the devil.

00:43:33.540 --> 00:43:36.750
But it was her clarity
that actually--

00:43:36.750 --> 00:43:40.770
the clarity that was in her work
got her in trouble in a way.

00:43:40.770 --> 00:43:43.110
And people complained
about that.

00:43:43.110 --> 00:43:44.690
So one of the reasons--

00:43:44.690 --> 00:43:48.030
when she kept writing, one of
the reasons she became a little

00:43:48.030 --> 00:43:51.750
bit less clear in
cases, I think,

00:43:51.750 --> 00:43:57.030
is because she had to kind of
be a little bit more meandering,

00:43:57.030 --> 00:43:57.990
rather-- sorry--

00:43:57.990 --> 00:44:02.180
in order to kind of
accommodate these problems.

00:44:02.180 --> 00:44:05.480
Just to make clear how
incredibly famous she was,

00:44:05.480 --> 00:44:09.800
this is one of the many English
translations of her work.

00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:13.280
And I just want to point out
this incredible little bit here

00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:17.900
that I've found in
the Folger Library.

00:44:17.900 --> 00:44:20.150
"It presently
appeareth a new wonder

00:44:20.150 --> 00:44:23.490
that a weak woman should be
so courageous as to undertake

00:44:23.490 --> 00:44:28.010
So great an essay and so
wise and of such efficacy

00:44:28.010 --> 00:44:33.200
that she should bring it to pass
and rob the hearts of those who

00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:35.340
treated with her," and so on.

00:44:35.340 --> 00:44:37.910
Now notice that there
is always how smart she

00:44:37.910 --> 00:44:42.020
is, how awesome she is, how
clear-headed she is, but also

00:44:42.020 --> 00:44:44.450
how she wins the
hearts, because she

00:44:44.450 --> 00:44:47.480
does that with her sort
of constant very, very

00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:51.170
touching personal touches.

00:44:51.170 --> 00:44:54.320
So she was this great
woman writing books.

00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:57.950
But she also had to
present her philosophy,

00:44:57.950 --> 00:45:01.940
think about her philosophy
in a gendered way

00:45:01.940 --> 00:45:06.430
so that it be taken seriously.

00:45:06.430 --> 00:45:09.010
So my question then, and
something I really look forward

00:45:09.010 --> 00:45:11.350
to talking to people
about over the year,

00:45:11.350 --> 00:45:15.100
is sort of how to think about
the non-philosophical ways

00:45:15.100 --> 00:45:18.370
in which some of these texts,
though richly philosophical,

00:45:18.370 --> 00:45:21.580
should be thought about.

00:45:21.580 --> 00:45:25.600
Now in conclusion-- I have a
conclusion and then a coda.

00:45:25.600 --> 00:45:28.732
And my conclusion is
just that obviously--

00:45:28.732 --> 00:45:30.940
I hope I've convinced you
by just the little bit I've

00:45:30.940 --> 00:45:34.660
said that obviously the standard
narrative of the development

00:45:34.660 --> 00:45:37.930
of early modern philosophy
has to be rethought.

00:45:37.930 --> 00:45:40.690
The subjective turn
happened earlier.

00:45:40.690 --> 00:45:44.470
Many of the features that we
attribute to enlightenment

00:45:44.470 --> 00:45:48.530
thinkers, which I can barely
even talk about today,

00:45:48.530 --> 00:45:51.570
extend throughout this period.

00:45:51.570 --> 00:45:53.440
I have lots of questions
to my colleagues,

00:45:53.440 --> 00:45:54.940
and I really look
forward to talking

00:45:54.940 --> 00:45:59.410
to you about how best to treat
this material going ahead.

00:45:59.410 --> 00:46:01.870
But I want to end my
lecture, because this

00:46:01.870 --> 00:46:06.160
is my tendency these days,
with something that we

00:46:06.160 --> 00:46:07.900
should be thinking about--

00:46:07.900 --> 00:46:10.150
the pain and suffering now.

00:46:10.150 --> 00:46:13.950
Now we can look at
Bruegel's Triumph of Death.

00:46:13.950 --> 00:46:15.640
And we can sort
of think about how

00:46:15.640 --> 00:46:18.970
we kind of confront and
don't confront suffering

00:46:18.970 --> 00:46:20.290
in life, right?

00:46:20.290 --> 00:46:22.900
So one of the things I
want to make very clear

00:46:22.900 --> 00:46:25.420
is something that is that.

00:46:25.420 --> 00:46:28.330
There's so much pain
and suffering around us

00:46:28.330 --> 00:46:31.750
that we actually sometimes
don't have the opportunity

00:46:31.750 --> 00:46:35.750
to think as much about compasio
as these late medieval women

00:46:35.750 --> 00:46:36.250
did.

00:46:36.250 --> 00:46:39.220
These late medieval
women were focused

00:46:39.220 --> 00:46:42.280
on how we think about ourselves
in relation to the world.

00:46:42.280 --> 00:46:47.290
So just a couple quick little
facts, one to do with Harvard.

00:46:47.290 --> 00:46:50.995
I wrote an op-ed
three years ago,

00:46:50.995 --> 00:46:52.870
because there had been
a big push at Columbia

00:46:52.870 --> 00:46:55.840
to divest from the
private prison industry.

00:46:55.840 --> 00:46:59.710
Now, if you don't know, the
private prisons run almost all

00:46:59.710 --> 00:47:01.700
of the detention centers.

00:47:01.700 --> 00:47:04.390
So the poor immigrants
that we worry a lot about--

00:47:04.390 --> 00:47:06.880
we worry and gnash our
teeth about the fact that

00:47:06.880 --> 00:47:09.880
the children are being ripped
from their mothers and fathers

00:47:09.880 --> 00:47:10.900
and so on and so forth--

00:47:10.900 --> 00:47:12.680
we really care about that.

00:47:12.680 --> 00:47:15.670
But how many people
know that most of them

00:47:15.670 --> 00:47:17.840
are sent off to private prisons?

00:47:17.840 --> 00:47:19.630
They're private.

00:47:19.630 --> 00:47:21.700
The whole point is for
them to make money.

00:47:21.700 --> 00:47:24.490
And they make
millions of dollars.

00:47:24.490 --> 00:47:26.470
The CEO of CoreCivic--

00:47:26.470 --> 00:47:28.150
what a lovely name for it--

00:47:28.150 --> 00:47:31.420
makes something like
$5 million a year, OK?

00:47:31.420 --> 00:47:33.410
Now this is a fact
that we might think,

00:47:33.410 --> 00:47:35.950
well, OK there's lots of
really bad stuff that happens.

00:47:35.950 --> 00:47:37.500
What can we do about it?

00:47:37.500 --> 00:47:42.230
But the fact is, Harvard
University, for example,

00:47:42.230 --> 00:47:45.530
still invest in the
private prison industry.

00:47:45.530 --> 00:47:47.770
In fact, Harvard-- part
of the point of my op-ed

00:47:47.770 --> 00:47:49.570
is-- and I pick out
Harvard because it

00:47:49.570 --> 00:47:51.700
has such a bad history.

00:47:51.700 --> 00:47:55.720
Harvard didn't even
divest from South Africa

00:47:55.720 --> 00:47:58.700
during the apartheid
period, right?

00:47:58.700 --> 00:48:01.030
And it won't even
consider divesting

00:48:01.030 --> 00:48:02.860
from the private
prison industry.

00:48:02.860 --> 00:48:06.250
So when you're not
sleeping at night

00:48:06.250 --> 00:48:09.040
because you can't bear the
thought of these poor children

00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:11.260
being ripped from
their mother or father,

00:48:11.260 --> 00:48:14.710
realize that your salary,
if you're at Harvard,

00:48:14.710 --> 00:48:18.310
or this nifty podium
here is partly

00:48:18.310 --> 00:48:21.700
paid for on the backs
of these children.

00:48:21.700 --> 00:48:24.160
Whoa, this is heavy.

00:48:24.160 --> 00:48:27.550
And then for those of
you who are not Harvard,

00:48:27.550 --> 00:48:31.120
you don't escape
my wrath either.

00:48:31.120 --> 00:48:35.470
Just 3.5 miles from
where I'm standing now

00:48:35.470 --> 00:48:39.402
is the Suffolk County
jail, which houses--

00:48:39.402 --> 00:48:40.860
it's really hard
to get information

00:48:40.860 --> 00:48:42.026
about some of these places--

00:48:42.026 --> 00:48:45.662
775 people who are there.

00:48:45.662 --> 00:48:47.620
Now let's just think
about what jails are like.

00:48:47.620 --> 00:48:49.750
And again, a lot of
people don't confront this

00:48:49.750 --> 00:48:51.550
as much as I think they should.

00:48:51.550 --> 00:48:54.310
About probably 2/3 of
the people in that jail

00:48:54.310 --> 00:48:57.010
are there because
they can't pay bail.

00:48:57.010 --> 00:48:59.530
So if the same person who
did the same crime who

00:48:59.530 --> 00:49:01.720
has the money to
pay bail gets to sit

00:49:01.720 --> 00:49:03.970
at home waiting for
his or her crime,

00:49:03.970 --> 00:49:06.250
but the people in
Suffolk County who

00:49:06.250 --> 00:49:11.440
are there who can't pay bail
are being abused, right?

00:49:11.440 --> 00:49:15.010
In fact, a lot of the more
vulnerable of the people

00:49:15.010 --> 00:49:17.664
are being put in
solitary confinement.

00:49:17.664 --> 00:49:20.080
And one of the things I learned
is that Massachusetts-- so

00:49:20.080 --> 00:49:21.955
you can think that you're
from Massachusetts,

00:49:21.955 --> 00:49:24.070
it's a pretty liberal,
progressive state.

00:49:24.070 --> 00:49:26.950
It's not good on
solitary confinement.

00:49:26.950 --> 00:49:30.500
And there is no movement
to change the bail system.

00:49:30.500 --> 00:49:32.820
Now, some of you may know
this incredible story

00:49:32.820 --> 00:49:35.620
about Kalief Browder, and
this is my last little slap

00:49:35.620 --> 00:49:36.820
in the face.

00:49:36.820 --> 00:49:38.350
This was in The New Yorker.

00:49:38.350 --> 00:49:41.720
But here's this young man who
turned out to be innocent,

00:49:41.720 --> 00:49:45.070
but was arrested for basically
looking black and having

00:49:45.070 --> 00:49:49.300
a backpack, was thrown
in jail, face was a mess.

00:49:49.300 --> 00:49:50.890
He was put in
solitary confinement

00:49:50.890 --> 00:49:52.900
because he was so vulnerable.

00:49:52.900 --> 00:49:56.620
He was in solitary confinement
for over two years.

00:49:56.620 --> 00:50:00.470
When he finally gets out,
he's basically lost his mind.

00:50:00.470 --> 00:50:04.120
And I think three years later,
he's committed suicide, right?

00:50:04.120 --> 00:50:07.180
So I just want to make clear
this is the [INAUDIBLE] point

00:50:07.180 --> 00:50:08.560
that I made earlier.

00:50:08.560 --> 00:50:10.660
When we think
about the suffering

00:50:10.660 --> 00:50:14.440
in 16th and 17th century
Europe and the suffering

00:50:14.440 --> 00:50:16.630
that these women had to
face in their own lives

00:50:16.630 --> 00:50:20.140
in late medieval Europe,
much of that suffering

00:50:20.140 --> 00:50:23.620
was kind of present and
real, whereas we conveniently

00:50:23.620 --> 00:50:28.450
throw our suffering into boxes
far away that we can't see.

00:50:28.450 --> 00:50:31.630
So I said that I wasn't going
to cause you pain and suffering.

00:50:31.630 --> 00:50:33.547
And I have, I
hope, a little bit.

00:50:33.547 --> 00:50:35.380
But anyway, I also hope
I've enlightened you

00:50:35.380 --> 00:50:37.450
a little bit about
the need to rethink

00:50:37.450 --> 00:50:39.520
suffering in life
and in particular

00:50:39.520 --> 00:50:40.900
in the history of philosophy.

00:50:40.900 --> 00:50:41.505
Thank you.

00:50:41.505 --> 00:50:42.130
