1
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:03,560
Alright. Sorry, Robert,
I have you to turn to,

2
00:00:03,561 --> 00:00:07,550
I'm gathering my thoughts as I'm speaking.
Yeah. Okay. All right. Robert? Yes.

3
00:00:07,551 --> 00:00:11,150
Season two, finale of more.
Perfect. Yes. Long overdue,

4
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:13,570
but much anticipated maybe. Yeah.

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,280
Maybe among those who care among the
[inaudible] care, it growing, number one,

6
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:21,470
one can help you having a modest
day to day. It's, you know, it's uh,

7
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:25,400
it's Tuesday. It's Tuesday. It's modesty.
Tuesday. Yes. Modesty. Tuesday. Okay.

8
00:00:25,401 --> 00:00:27,500
So I want to bring you a
story from the more perfect,

9
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:31,640
the final story of season two because
this story fulfills a promise I made to

10
00:00:31,641 --> 00:00:35,810
myself at the very beginning
of more. Perfect. Oh my God.

11
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:40,070
This question of yours is that old and
that deep. It's only two years old.

12
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:43,850
Just two girls show. But when people
hear what the question is, they will,

13
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:46,340
eyeballs will be rubbed. No,
no, no. All right. Go ahead.

14
00:00:46,341 --> 00:00:47,420
Tell them it's modesty. Tuesday.

15
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:51,350
What was it two years ago that stuck you
at a question you have never been able

16
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:53,330
to let go of question and
everybody will let go.

17
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,780
One of the first questions I bumped into
and learning about the Supreme Court

18
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,033
[inaudible]

19
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:03,380
was why does everybody keep talking about
this thing called the commerce clause?

20
00:01:03,381 --> 00:01:05,210
Commerce cloud commerce commerce clause.

21
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,650
The commerce clause. Yes.
That had a dazzle for you. No,

22
00:01:12,651 --> 00:01:15,440
I just wanted to know what the
hell is it? Well, it's article one,

23
00:01:15,441 --> 00:01:19,820
section eight, clause three of the
constitution, 16 words to commas.

24
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:24,830
Congress shall have the power to regulate
commerce with foreign nations and

25
00:01:24,831 --> 00:01:27,410
among the several states
and with the Indian tribe,

26
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,350
the power to regulate
commerce with foreign nations.

27
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:32,840
And among the several states
and with the Indian tribes,

28
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:35,780
there are no more sexier words
in the English language. Yes.

29
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:37,730
Better words for Wuhan were never written.

30
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:41,600
That's Jamie Floyd and Ari Savitsky will
meet them properly in just a second.

31
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:44,540
Okay. So turns out that question of like,

32
00:01:44,541 --> 00:01:49,190
what is it is pretty easy to answer to
these 16 words in the constitution that

33
00:01:49,191 --> 00:01:50,450
say, uh,

34
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:54,290
Congress has the power to regulate
commerce from one state to another.

35
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:57,050
Like as soon as it goes between
states across state borders,

36
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:58,780
the feds can regulate it.

37
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:01,490
I think that they're with the SAI would
begin and end and that would be the only

38
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:05,300
way. So, well, yes, but here's the thing

39
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:08,900
within that Shell of Boring

40
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:13,670
is I'm politely silent.

41
00:02:13,671 --> 00:02:18,671
Here is an amazing story of a kind of
cosmic power that develops from very

42
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:24,020
humble beginnings to something
truly extraordinary and
maybe troubling depending

43
00:02:24,021 --> 00:02:26,270
on who you are. A cosmic power.

44
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:30,380
You mean this phrase from the constitution
has had consequences that surprised

45
00:02:30,381 --> 00:02:32,390
you? Oh boy. Oh boy.

46
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:35,560
Here's how I've been thinking about
it in the more perfect story. For me,

47
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:39,910
the experience I had learning about the
commerce clause was a little bit like

48
00:02:39,911 --> 00:02:43,960
watching the x men movies. Initially
I was like, my name is Mike NATO.

49
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:48,100
Why is magneto the head of the bad
guys do join my brother Hood and fight?

50
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:50,930
Why would they follow him? He
has the most boring power. Your,

51
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,260
I mean he can control metal. Okay,

52
00:02:53,261 --> 00:02:56,380
well like those mystique can
shift into any shape she wants.

53
00:02:56,381 --> 00:02:58,930
Dorm can control lightning.

54
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:02,040
Initially, his [inaudible]

55
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,900
power seem like you have the worst one.

56
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:08,240
So we start with the commerce clause
and we ask the riddle of magneto.

57
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:11,040
I am trying to cross the bridge
and getting, I'm getting there.

58
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:15,570
All I'm saying is that like initially I
didn't understand the true deep nature

59
00:03:15,571 --> 00:03:17,130
of his power, but then

60
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:24,690
you see these scenes where he's like
being attacked by a thousand policemen and

61
00:03:25,001 --> 00:03:30,001
he just kind of makes their bullets
freeze in midair or he picks up a whole

62
00:03:31,121 --> 00:03:33,790
bridge with lights pointing at it

63
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,390
and then it hits you all.

64
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:39,680
Oh, he has the best

65
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,473
[inaudible]

66
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:43,390
because the whole world is made of metal

67
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:46,280
[inaudible]

68
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,660
he can control the world

69
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:50,970
[inaudible]

70
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:52,700
if we built the world a
different way, maybe not yet

71
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,290
in this world, let's just say
I'm Frankenstein's monster,

72
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:02,700
periodic table, baby periodic table baby.

73
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:06,270
So that's for me what it was like
to learn about the commerce clause.

74
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:11,300
What initially seems stupid and boring
becomes extraordinarily powerful.

75
00:04:12,391 --> 00:04:15,360
Once you understand that the
world in which it is situated,

76
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:17,100
does that mean you're
about to take us on a,

77
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:21,840
on a journey which begins with something
that feels utterly trivial and ends up

78
00:04:21,841 --> 00:04:26,340
with being something
enormously powerful? Wow.

79
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:30,390
Has a question to which I
simply must answer. Yes.

80
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:39,880
The question. We laid it all out
there. I am doing well then we can get,

81
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,420
we can get on with it then.

82
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:43,490
Yeah. I won't tell you the
story of the commerce clause.

83
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:48,550
Everything we fight about in
America is in these 16 words,

84
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,710
the honorable, the chief justice,

85
00:04:51,711 --> 00:04:55,490
and the associate justices of the
Supreme Court of the United States.

86
00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:00,470
Oh, Yay. Yay. Yeah.

87
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,750
Before the honorable,

88
00:05:02,751 --> 00:05:05,870
the supreme court in the United
States rent money to draw an Aaron

89
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:14,143
[inaudible] card.

90
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:22,813
[inaudible]

91
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:31,483
[inaudible].

92
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,420
All right. I'm gonna. I'm
gonna Start you good? Yup.

93
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:40,820
To even explain why something
like the commerce clause exists,

94
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,220
just pull out a dollar bill. Go
ahead and pull it out. Right.

95
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:47,990
If it's issued by a central bank, are
you looking at a dollar bill? Right now?

96
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:51,590
I'm looking at dollar bill says Federal
Reserve Note, United States of America.

97
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:55,400
That is James Chen, professor of
law at Michigan State University.

98
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:58,400
Now the thing about a dollar bill,

99
00:05:58,401 --> 00:06:03,401
the awesome obvious thing is that you
can take that dollar bill and buy some

100
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:07,880
sour patch kids or whatever a dollar buys
these days anywhere in America. Right,

101
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:10,910
but in the late 18th century, in fact,

102
00:06:10,911 --> 00:06:15,560
all the way through to the 20th century,
it wasn't like that. No, no, no, no,

103
00:06:15,561 --> 00:06:19,970
no. All the states had their own banks
and their own bills, different sizes,

104
00:06:19,971 --> 00:06:21,110
colors. For example,

105
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:24,860
there was a moment when South Carolina
has this pretty little green South

106
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:29,810
Carolina Bill, same time Rhode Island
has this giant pink square thing,

107
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:34,960
and if you are a South Carolinian in Rhode
Island trying to buy some carrots and

108
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:38,120
potatoes, let's say, let's say that,
and you've got to make payments somehow.

109
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:41,000
What do you do? Well, you hand them
your South Carolina Bill. Well,

110
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:43,010
the Rhode Islanders would
look at that and say, well,

111
00:06:43,011 --> 00:06:46,820
I don't know if this is who's
to trust this bank. Right?

112
00:06:46,821 --> 00:06:51,821
And so they would discount the note based
on the distance from their own home.

113
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:56,090
They would discount the
note based on how it looks,

114
00:06:56,091 --> 00:07:00,110
how professionally drawn up it was.
They might look at that $10 and say,

115
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:02,270
that's only worth eight. To me,

116
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:05,450
that's a horrible [inaudible]
way to do business.

117
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,940
That sucks for the person
who holding the note. Right?

118
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:11,420
And so what the government
decided to do is to say, hey,

119
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:15,530
we're just gonna use one bill, just
one bill. It's gonna be so much easier.

120
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,610
This is one of the ways government is
going to pull all these different states

121
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:20,511
together.

122
00:07:20,511 --> 00:07:23,660
They were gonna regulate the currency
and not just the currency itself.

123
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:25,670
They were going to regulate the flow

124
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:30,340
of that currency. And this is
where the commerce clause comes in.

125
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:34,680
[inaudible]

126
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,950
this is Jamie Floyd, journalist,
sometimes legal analyst,

127
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:42,240
host of all things considered here
at WM YC. It's early in the republic.

128
00:07:42,241 --> 00:07:46,140
Now we're at 1820s no, just
to hit pause for one second.

129
00:07:46,141 --> 00:07:50,010
So the commerce clause was a preexisting
thing. Oh yeah. Okay. Oh yeah.

130
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:51,990
It's in the US Constitution.

131
00:07:51,991 --> 00:07:55,080
But it's never been really
like thought about or where,

132
00:07:55,081 --> 00:07:58,020
where is it in the minds of people
a date? Do you know where? Nowhere.

133
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:01,560
Pretty much where it is right now.
It's nowhere in the minds of people.

134
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:03,213
[inaudible]

135
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:09,090
she says 1824 to steamboat operators get
into a thing. It's a business dispute.

136
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,640
They're each going back and forth
between New York and New Jersey.

137
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:12,230
They each thing,

138
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:15,630
they should be the only one allowed to
do that and it makes its way, as we say,

139
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:19,590
all the way to the u s supreme court

140
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,640
and who's sitting up there? Well,
a big bad dude named John Marshall.

141
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:28,100
Marshall is the sort of

142
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:33,440
Rambo of the court.

143
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:35,750
He looks at those 16 words,

144
00:08:35,751 --> 00:08:39,380
Congress shall have the power to regulate
commerce with foreign nations and

145
00:08:39,381 --> 00:08:40,280
among the several states.

146
00:08:40,281 --> 00:08:44,540
He looks at those 16 words and a couple
of commas and a period and he decides

147
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:49,280
pretty much for the first time that
those words give Congress the power to

148
00:08:49,281 --> 00:08:52,910
regulate commerce
between and among states.

149
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:56,160
This boat is going from one
state to the other. The only way

150
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:01,160
to resolve that is for the federal
government to come in and control it.

151
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:02,341
Again,

152
00:09:02,341 --> 00:09:07,341
the idea is that this is the only way
for the country to function as a unified

153
00:09:07,801 --> 00:09:08,634
thing.

154
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:13,460
And John Marshall, when he writes
his decision, he says it, look,

155
00:09:13,461 --> 00:09:15,530
we have a United States of America.

156
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:20,740
We don't have a divided states of America
or independent states of America or

157
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:24,320
New Jersey and New York
existing separately.

158
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:28,520
We decided to organize as a United States.

159
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:32,270
And so what John Marshall
says is because of that,

160
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:37,280
there has to be a power to regulate trade
between those states and amongst those

161
00:09:37,281 --> 00:09:39,140
states when there are disputes,

162
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:43,040
otherwise it's all gonna fall apart.

163
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,480
It was at that point that the
commerce clause began to glow,

164
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:59,310
but very faintly for
the next hundred years,

165
00:09:59,311 --> 00:10:02,160
the government would experiment with
the commerce clause in cases involving

166
00:10:02,161 --> 00:10:05,160
trade with the native
American tribes or navigation.

167
00:10:05,161 --> 00:10:09,180
But if you want to talk
about power, like real, raw,

168
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:14,930
weird power, that power got unleashed, uh,

169
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:19,750
at a very specific moment
around 1941 in a wheat field.

170
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,810
Well, what happened in
the wheat field? Okay,

171
00:10:22,811 --> 00:10:23,980
well let me introduce you to someone

172
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:26,480
[inaudible]

173
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,160
my father was a farmer.

174
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:33,080
I'd like to say all of these life
took pride in the fact that he never,

175
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:36,380
he never worked for another
man. Uh, he would tell me that.

176
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:40,220
Can you introduce yourself? Well,
my name is the same as my father.

177
00:10:40,221 --> 00:10:42,620
It's Roscoe Curtis, Phil Brun.

178
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:46,640
I'm a junior Roscoe film burn
as he was known at the time.

179
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:51,590
He was a fifth generation
farmer in Montgomery, Ohio. Our,

180
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:55,970
our farm was just right
next to Dayton, Ohio.

181
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:59,870
Roscoe is about a 40 year
old man at this point. Ken,

182
00:10:59,871 --> 00:11:04,010
we're talking about 1941
42 good looking, sturdy,

183
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:05,480
fiercely independent.

184
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:09,740
I never worked for another man in my life.

185
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:14,270
Apparently that was his motto. He would
tell me that many times over the years.

186
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:17,840
If you had to put like captain
America with a pitchfork,

187
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:19,953
this is him.

188
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:25,390
So Roscoe's got this farm more
than a hundred cows on it.

189
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:30,160
He would milk cows until both of
these arms went practically numb. Wow.

190
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:35,260
Cat chickens, 3000 chickens. And
we had them a very big garden.

191
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:39,130
He would plant things, you know,
like string beans, Lima beans, peas,

192
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:41,710
sweet corn, potatoes, carrots, radishes.

193
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:45,760
Couple of different kinds of fruit
trees, apples, cherry trees, peach trees,

194
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:49,540
pears, strawberries and raspberries.
Oh. And of course they had crops.

195
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:53,620
We would grow corn and couple of
different kinds of hay, oats and course

196
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:58,980
wheat, wheat. Okay. Set up out of
the way. Here's what happened. Um,

197
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:03,600
it's 1941, Roscoe senior.

198
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:06,570
My dad was out in the field
I think on his tractor

199
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:10,550
that day. He was plowing
the weed or something and

200
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:14,600
there permanently must've been a, some guy

201
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:20,660
from the Department of
Agriculture locally,

202
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:24,890
I guess going around to various
farmers in our community,

203
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:29,150
a wanting the farmers
to answer several pages.

204
00:12:29,151 --> 00:12:33,720
I think of questions. And this
particular day, this government, uh,

205
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:37,310
a gentleman came out in the
law field. He looked around

206
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:42,510
and he said, Rosco, by my calculations,

207
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:47,400
you've got 22 acres of wheat on
this farm. You're over your quota.

208
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:51,240
He was 11.1 acres over
what was permitted roughly.

209
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:53,430
And so the guy tells him,
you have to pay a fine,

210
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:57,080
really big fine.

211
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:04,460
My Dad looked over and he was just as
sober as that judge in a courtroom on a

212
00:13:04,461 --> 00:13:05,300
murder case.

213
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:11,640
And what happened next would change
the country forever in ways that we are

214
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:15,240
still literally living with. But let
me just sort of fill in the gaps here,

215
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:17,040
tell you what you need to
know about why they're,

216
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:21,480
why they were even having this
conversation. And to help me with that.

217
00:13:21,481 --> 00:13:24,090
My name is Ari Syvitski
and I'm an attorney.

218
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:26,670
Let me bring in a friend of the
show, man of the law. You know,

219
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:29,460
an important thing to
understand is that, you know,

220
00:13:29,461 --> 00:13:31,770
when our story starts with Roscoe Filburn

221
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,120
agriculture is a huge
percentage of the economy.

222
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:38,990
The Great Depression is happening
up on the central panic,

223
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:41,120
gripped the world and the dust bowl,

224
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:45,560
the great dust storms of the mid 1930s
has happened to [inaudible] America's

225
00:13:45,561 --> 00:13:46,394
great plains.

226
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:50,090
And so you have a lot of people who
rely on selling crops and buying crops.

227
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:54,200
And so wheat prices too matter of life
and death for millions of Americans,

228
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:59,150
this nation is paying far
Ectron and a come out.

229
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:00,591
So look,

230
00:14:00,591 --> 00:14:05,591
so 1938 congress enacts what's called
the Agricultural Adjustment Act to reboot

231
00:14:07,251 --> 00:14:08,084
the economy.

232
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:13,340
So the 1938 Agricultural Adjustment
Act got the federal government into the

233
00:14:13,341 --> 00:14:15,770
business of regulating wheat.

234
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,890
Basically what the government did was
they said to the farmers of America,

235
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:21,140
we are going to give
you essentially a loan.

236
00:14:21,141 --> 00:14:26,141
We're gonna guarantee you a
certain minimum price for wheat.

237
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:29,930
We're going to give you x number of
dollars per Bushel or whatever it is,

238
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:34,130
and that will help lift you out
of poverty. In exchange for that,

239
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:38,990
you have to promise us to
only grow a certain amount.

240
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,600
This is the big fear was
that if they grew too much,

241
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:46,070
there'd be this flood of supply on
the wheat market, prices would crash.

242
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,560
And that will be bad
for everyone. You know,

243
00:14:48,561 --> 00:14:50,510
wheat is sort of a collective
action problem, right?

244
00:14:50,511 --> 00:14:52,370
Everyone's going sell as
much weed as they can,

245
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:55,100
but that means prices go
down and everyone makes less.

246
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:58,940
So what the government decided to do
in addition to giving out loans is that

247
00:14:58,941 --> 00:15:02,990
they placed a cap on how much wheat
a person could grow. So quota,

248
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:03,860
straight up quota.

249
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:08,600
That way you ensure that the supply of
wheat is steady and you ensure that,

250
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,760
uh, that the prices don't crash.

251
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,870
And the whole reason the government
could do this regulate the entire wheat

252
00:15:14,871 --> 00:15:17,750
market was by hinge Egon
on the commerce clause.

253
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:22,250
Those 16 words that basically said that
when something like wheat is bought and

254
00:15:22,251 --> 00:15:23,960
sold and moved from one place to another,

255
00:15:23,961 --> 00:15:26,330
one state to another cross state lines,

256
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:30,500
well that's interstate commerce and that's
something that Congress can regulate.

257
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:38,280
So my father having this brings us back
to Roscoe Filburn would that inspector

258
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:42,960
on his farm inspector says, look,
Roscoe, you've grown too much wheat.

259
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:47,430
My Dad looked over and he was just as
sober as that judge in a courtroom on a

260
00:15:47,431 --> 00:15:51,510
murder case. And what do you think?
He says back, he says, wait a minute,

261
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:55,650
I'm going to tell you what, just
exactly how I feel about that. No,

262
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:59,040
that's how I feel. No, you
government, I don't know.

263
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:03,500
He might've been a family guy. Yeah. He
says, I don't get it. I'm not, I'm not,

264
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:06,590
I have nothing to do with
interstate commerce. And

265
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:07,810
this is the key.

266
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,090
[inaudible]

267
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:14,720
he explains to the inspector that yes,
according to the government quota,

268
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:19,900
I'm only supposed to grow about 11 acres
of wheat and I am growing 23 but that

269
00:16:20,151 --> 00:16:20,984
extra 12

270
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:22,020
hello.

271
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:24,600
I'm not selling it to anybody.
He doesn't sell the week.

272
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:26,980
He doesn't trade the wheat.
What's he doing with his wheat?

273
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,650
He uses all the wheat to feed his
animals who use feeding it to the farm

274
00:16:31,651 --> 00:16:36,440
animals. The weight. He fed the
some of the wheat to the stares. I,

275
00:16:36,441 --> 00:16:38,790
I was just keeping it
on the farm. Well, yes.

276
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:42,900
So it's in a completely internal
operation. I do. I sound biased here.

277
00:16:42,901 --> 00:16:47,040
I'm going to feel like the poor guy gets
kind of dragged into a national case in

278
00:16:47,041 --> 00:16:48,440
case he tells the inspector I'm not,

279
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:50,520
I have nothing to do
with interstate commerce.

280
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:53,280
Just grown a little extra wheat
to feed my cows. I'm on my farm,

281
00:16:53,281 --> 00:16:54,210
I'm doing my business.

282
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:59,050
Big, big brother. Leave me alone. But
big brother does not leave him alone.

283
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:04,520
The inspector says we're the government.
That's the law. Please uphold it.

284
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:10,300
Pay the fine 50 cents
for every excess Bushel.

285
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:15,410
I think it is. He had 239 excess
bushels of wheat for which he was,

286
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:19,040
you know, fine about 117
bucks in today's dollars.

287
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:21,710
It's about two grand, two grand.

288
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,170
[inaudible]

289
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:25,430
my, my father,

290
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:30,500
apparently he wasn't real crazy about
that and I guess he didn't like that too

291
00:17:30,501 --> 00:17:33,890
much. If I'd have been 20 or 25 years old,

292
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:37,910
I would have probably advised
my father not to do what he did.

293
00:17:37,911 --> 00:17:42,530
But I guess he sued the
federal government. Huh?
His argument was like, look,

294
00:17:42,531 --> 00:17:44,720
I'm just trying to feed my cows. Come on.

295
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:49,130
I guess it went to on our
court in Dayton, Ohio.

296
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:50,160
That was the first stop.

297
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,470
And I believe that he was

298
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:57,390
one round one to Roscoe.
The Ohio court agreed.

299
00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:00,300
There's no commerce of
any kind nine going on.

300
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,720
You're unlike the original
case with the boat. Right.

301
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:05,900
I believe I even remember him, uh,

302
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:10,840
my sister telling me that the,
he came home and he was just, uh,

303
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:14,220
delighted that he did win. But then,

304
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:15,820
okay,

305
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:20,820
the government appeals the case and of
course the one had got to the Supreme

306
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,690
Court of the United States.

307
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:24,340
Okay.

308
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:25,990
He, he, he lost

309
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:29,290
[inaudible].

310
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:34,290
He lost in a decision that I think it's
fair to say still drives conservatives

311
00:18:35,411 --> 00:18:39,820
and Libertarians bonkers and I am neither
one of those things, but I get it.

312
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:45,880
What the Supreme Court said is it Roscoe
Filburn growing that extra wheat and

313
00:18:45,881 --> 00:18:46,571
not selling,

314
00:18:46,571 --> 00:18:51,571
it still counts as interstate commerce
because half of that extra week causes

315
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:55,930
him to not buy it on the market.

316
00:18:57,010 --> 00:19:00,970
He needs less wheat from the market and
if all the farmers of America did that,

317
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,750
then that'd be really bad for the market.

318
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:08,080
The idea is that if you need
more wheat than the quota,

319
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:12,220
you go on the market and buy it.
Even though you can grow it yourself,

320
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:16,360
you got to buy it because if everyone
can produce their quota and then whatever

321
00:19:16,361 --> 00:19:20,320
extra they need, I mean pretty
soon the regulation breaks down,

322
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:23,830
which means that the
government intervention in
the wheat market will fail.

323
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:28,370
You will have defeated our
attempt to regulate this market.

324
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:31,160
Therefore we have to regulate.
Even the things you don't do.

325
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:34,750
[inaudible].

326
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:38,230
See that is so weird. It's such
a mind. Frankly. It's like, well,

327
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:42,940
he's not doing anything. Well, we'll
just literally non behavior. This is,

328
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:45,610
this is Obamacare. It's very
much like the healthcare case.

329
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:52,150
It's getting heated over healthcare.
Today's issue, the individual mandate,

330
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:56,050
just to explain, that's a reference
to Barack Obama's healthcare plan.

331
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:59,530
There's hotly debated a couple of
years ago, still hotly debated.

332
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,980
One of the key ideas of that plan is
that in order for healthcare to be

333
00:20:02,981 --> 00:20:06,280
affordable for everyone independent,
everyone should have to buy it,

334
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:10,600
so we're going to require people to buy
insurance or else you pay a penalty,

335
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,430
which made a lot of people
mad because they're like, hey,

336
00:20:12,431 --> 00:20:14,470
the government's forcing me to
buy something. I don't want.

337
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:19,530
My decision not to get healthcare is not
participation in interstate commerce.

338
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:21,460
It's not even economic activity.

339
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:24,400
I'm sitting here on my
couch not buying healthcare.

340
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:28,240
I'm just sitting here from the individual
perspective. That makes perfect sense.

341
00:20:28,241 --> 00:20:32,290
But in the aggregate, if you pan out
and justice Kagan said this in court,

342
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,430
it's not so simple

343
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:38,820
and the aggregate of all these uninsured
people are increasing the normal family

344
00:20:39,691 --> 00:20:43,170
premium congresses by $1,000 a year.

345
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:48,550
Those people are in commerce.
They're making decisions that are

346
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:53,620
uh, affecting the price that
everybody pays for this service.

347
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:57,400
Obamacare makes sense to me in
some, in some spiritual way,

348
00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:01,410
but getting back to Roscoe, we're
regulating the things you're not doing.

349
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:03,700
No farmers and islands.

350
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:08,730
This is the case in which Congress
receives a tremendous amount of power from

351
00:21:09,581 --> 00:21:12,790
the U S Supreme Court.
Essentially this case,

352
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:17,080
it says that Congress can
regulate almost anything

353
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:24,030
and that is the single most
significant precedent in the area.

354
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:27,183
The Big Bang

355
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:36,483
[inaudible].

356
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:43,980
Did anyone sort of raise their hand in
the middle of this and be like, Whoa,

357
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:47,490
if you can regulate the non
behavior of this American farmer,

358
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:50,250
then that's not even a slippery slope.

359
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,810
That's like a cliff that goes right down
to like there's no slope to that. Yeah.

360
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:58,260
A New York Times editorial
from November 13, 1942 said,

361
00:21:58,290 --> 00:22:02,190
if the farmer who grows feed for
consumption on his own farm competes with

362
00:22:02,191 --> 00:22:06,360
commerce, would not the housewife who
makes herself address do so equally.

363
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:11,250
The net of the ruling in short seems to
be that Congress can regulate every form

364
00:22:11,251 --> 00:22:15,960
of economic activity if it so decides
would not the housewife who makes herself

365
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:20,770
address do so ego. Yeah. It's like,
yeah, if you make something like, shoot,

366
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:24,450
my wife and I with our kids made these
little like a miniature stuffed animals

367
00:22:24,451 --> 00:22:25,590
for them to play with the other day.

368
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:28,170
Are we then in violation
of some on my desk?

369
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:31,260
Seems crazy to make the kids do it and
now you've violated some child labor

370
00:22:31,261 --> 00:22:32,094
laws. Even

371
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:36,530
so like what happened to your
essentially Robert is the, um,

372
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:41,430
the definition of commerce, uh,

373
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,490
changed in as in a sneaky
but really powerful way.

374
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:47,310
Cause now it wasn't just like
the buying and selling of stuff.

375
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:49,860
It was the not buying and
selling of stuff. Yeah.

376
00:22:49,861 --> 00:22:52,350
It was your negative commercial activity.

377
00:22:52,351 --> 00:22:56,760
That is all the things you don't do as
a much bigger territory than the things

378
00:22:56,761 --> 00:22:57,920
you do do. Yeah.

379
00:22:58,030 --> 00:23:03,030
It's a massive extension of power and
that expansion would continue over the

380
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:07,170
next few decades and it would move from
just wheat to something much deeper to

381
00:23:07,171 --> 00:23:12,090
like beyond markets into the,
into matters of the heart.

382
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:17,210
You mean like people hating on each other
or people trusting people being great.

383
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:21,570
People all will become clear
after the break. After the break.

384
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:30,570
Excuse me while I get myself
up this sizzling drink and
settled down in my black

385
00:23:30,571 --> 00:23:33,780
leather couch. Ooh. Yeah.
All right. Season two,

386
00:23:33,781 --> 00:23:35,820
finale of more perfect here on radio lab.

387
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:38,880
We'll continue in a moment.

388
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,070
This is Nicole from

389
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:46,910
Corning, New York.

390
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:51,230
Radiolab is supported in part by the
Alfred p Sloan Foundation enhancing public

00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:01,910
Hey Simon Adler here. Uh,

394
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:06,150
I'm one of the producers here at Radiolab
and I wanted to take a quick second to

395
00:24:06,151 --> 00:24:09,200
tell you about something that, uh, that
I think is pretty interesting that,

396
00:24:09,201 --> 00:24:13,920
that we make here, uh, besides
the show. So we have a newsletter,

397
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:16,950
which I know everyone
does, but hear me out.

398
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:19,950
Unlike a lot of other
newsletters out there, uh,

399
00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:24,750
we don't waste your time by just blabbing
about what our next release will be or

400
00:24:24,751 --> 00:24:29,260
begging you for money. Uh, actually
we, we do a little bit of that. Uh,

401
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:33,840
but what we also do is each
time a new episode drops,

402
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:36,960
we send you a list of staff picks,

403
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:41,040
essentially a collection of things to
folks here who make this show have come

404
00:24:41,041 --> 00:24:43,770
across recently and are excited about, uh,

405
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:48,270
they range from books and music to TV
shows, youtube clips, art exhibits,

406
00:24:48,271 --> 00:24:52,650
blogs. It's sort of a repository for
the stuff that's got us interested.

407
00:24:52,651 --> 00:24:57,270
But for whatever reason, uh, we're not
sure how to turn into a radio story.

408
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:02,130
So if that sounds interesting to you
at all, I hope you'll sign up for it.

409
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:06,240
Our newsletter, it's free and you can
sign up in about just 30 seconds at

Hi, this is John Roderick
from the rock band,

414
00:25:27,041 --> 00:25:30,730
the long winters and I'm Ken Jennings
from the syndicated quiz show jeopardy.

415
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:33,100
We have a podcast called omnibus.

416
00:25:33,101 --> 00:25:37,420
It's a time capsule of our era and we
put a new entry in the ground every

417
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:37,900
Tuesday and Thursday.

418
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:42,190
Listen on Apple podcasts or wherever
you get your podcasts and subscribe to

419
00:25:42,191 --> 00:25:43,840
never miss a single episode.

420
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:53,950
I'm Jad Abumrad I am Robert
Krulwich. This is well,

421
00:25:53,951 --> 00:25:57,490
we're featuring the final episode
of more perfect season two, uh,

422
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:58,570
here on radio lab.

423
00:25:58,570 --> 00:26:02,890
A strange and Heartfield salute to the
commerce clause of the U s constitution.

424
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:06,640
Yes. And uh, previously we had
the big bang in the wheat field,

425
00:26:06,641 --> 00:26:09,790
but that was still about markets and
commerce and all that, right? Yeah,

426
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:15,840
there was a moment about two decades
after the wheat case where you might say

427
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:20,980
the commerce clause got weaponized. Hm.

428
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:25,800
Hello? Hey, can you hear me? Yes.

429
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:30,570
This is Jad from a Radiolab and more
perfect in New York and Jack. Jack j. A d.

430
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:32,190
J. A. J. A d. Okay.

431
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:35,370
Well Andrew is here and he's recording
to really understand what I mean,

432
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:38,220
you have to meet this guy. Can you
reduce yourself? Tell me who you are.

433
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:42,540
Your name? Yes, there's Ollie
McClung jr. And how old are you?

434
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,160
77

435
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:48,180
and where are you speaking to us from
right now? I'm in Birmingham, Alabama.

436
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:51,000
You were born in Birmingham? Yes. Gotcha.

437
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:54,110
Aside from some time at college in
Florida and a stint in the coast,

438
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:58,500
coastguard Ali Jr has lived
in Birmingham his entire life.

439
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:02,430
And the reason we call them
up is that for 75 years,

440
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,840
his family ran a famous
barbecue joint named Dolly's.

441
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:09,300
So this is your dad's business
from what I understand, right? Yes.

442
00:27:09,301 --> 00:27:13,950
My grandfather actually had founded
it. Oh really? When was that? 1926.

443
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:17,250
So this was passed to your dad
who passed it to you? Yes. Okay.

444
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:19,530
We were in business
together until he died.

445
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:23,490
Ollie's BBQ was located on Birmingham
south side of the building.

446
00:27:23,491 --> 00:27:27,300
We were in at the time, you're
talking about 1949 til 68.

447
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,280
It was concrete block,

448
00:27:29,281 --> 00:27:33,750
a big sign outside said world's best
barbecue. Pretty good for today.

449
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:37,080
Apparently during lunch the
line would stretch out the door.

450
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:42,390
Ali's was famous for its slow cooked
pork and chicken and for its a spicy

451
00:27:42,391 --> 00:27:45,900
vinegar barbecue sauce, a on
the pad baking chocolate pies.

452
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:47,490
We always did a lot of pies,

453
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:52,710
but Ollie's was also famous or would
become famous for something else entirely.

454
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:56,870
Oh, uh, locales. The Times, uh,

455
00:27:57,210 --> 00:28:01,740
in the way things were, uh, at that time
course throughout south and Birmingham,

456
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:04,890
uh, we had, uh,

457
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:09,810
carry out business as well as
sit down business and, and uh,

458
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:14,100
those of our black
customers came in and, uh,

459
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:19,200
ordered from the carry out counter and
took their food out and, um, you know,

460
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:23,470
truth fact history, uh,
they would take it on, uh,

461
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:25,530
with them to eat as opposed
to sitting down and eating.

462
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:29,360
What he's saying is that Ollie's barbecue
was segregated. If you were white,

463
00:28:29,361 --> 00:28:31,070
you could eat inside. If you were black,

464
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:34,740
you couldn't remain. That was
the way it work. [inaudible]

465
00:28:35,810 --> 00:28:40,070
okay. So what does this have to
do with the commerce clause? Okay,

466
00:28:40,071 --> 00:28:44,090
so the federal government at the time,
this would be the Kennedy Administration.

467
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:47,840
Then LBJ, they wanted to come
down and places like Ollie's BBQ,

468
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:53,430
but their hands were sort of tied. I mean,

469
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:56,090
we have this thing called the
14th amendment, which says,

470
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:59,210
no state shall deprive any person of life,

471
00:28:59,211 --> 00:29:01,490
liberty or property
without depressive of law.

472
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:05,270
Nor shall any state denied equal
protection of the laws to any person.

473
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,970
James Chin again? No. Those words he says,

474
00:29:07,971 --> 00:29:12,950
which were ratified right after the civil
war were written to basically outlaw

475
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:15,830
things like segregation.
Of course, it didn't work.

476
00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:18,110
We'd have another 80
plus years of Jim Crow.

477
00:29:18,111 --> 00:29:22,730
And the reason for that is that the
Supreme Court shortly after the 14th

478
00:29:22,731 --> 00:29:27,560
amendment was passed kind of new
debt. Well, not kind of. They did.

479
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:32,810
And one of the ways they
did was by insisting that we
read the 14th amendment as

480
00:29:32,811 --> 00:29:37,430
being targeted only at states.
If you look at that sentence,

481
00:29:37,431 --> 00:29:39,800
the second sentence of the
14th amendment says, no state,

482
00:29:39,801 --> 00:29:43,180
no state shall deprive any
person of life, liberty,

483
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:45,620
or property without
depressant. The problem is,

484
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:50,780
is when a restaurant owner like Ollie
McClung denies service to black patrons,

485
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:56,950
it's not Alabama doing the
damage just to private business.

486
00:29:57,070 --> 00:30:01,120
It's not as if Alabama ordered the McClung
family to discriminate against black

487
00:30:01,121 --> 00:30:02,440
patrons. They just did it.

488
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:07,530
So the 14th amendment can only get to
states here it has no reach because if

489
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:12,520
there's no state action, there is nothing
to regulate at the state level. So

490
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:15,680
[inaudible]

491
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:20,270
with the feds decided to
do in a fascinating bit of
legal gymnastics is they

492
00:30:20,271 --> 00:30:21,470
decided to use

493
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:26,010
[inaudible] the commerce clause.

494
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:29,790
Congress passes the most sweeping civil
rights bill ever to be written into the

495
00:30:29,791 --> 00:30:33,000
law, giving all Americans the
right to be served in facilities,

496
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:34,050
which you wrote them in the public.

497
00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:35,640
July 2nd, 1964,

498
00:30:35,641 --> 00:30:40,641
congress passes a sweeping civil rights
bill that was hinged on those 16 words.

499
00:30:40,831 --> 00:30:42,510
And I will explain to you how,

500
00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:44,940
because it's kind of
fascinating in just a second,

501
00:30:44,941 --> 00:30:47,520
but first just to get us to that point.

502
00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:52,800
So 1964 civil rights act is passed.

503
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:57,150
Did you desegregate right away? No. No.

504
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:02,380
Well we were, we were not
happy with it. Obviously,

505
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:07,110
I want to read to you something that
you said in 1964. I believe these are,

506
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:09,450
this is sort of your account
or something that happened in,

507
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:13,740
in your restaurant day after
the Civil Rights Act was passed.

508
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:18,360
A black man comes into the restaurant
asking to be served and uh,

509
00:31:18,361 --> 00:31:19,410
and you turn them away.

510
00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:23,400
45 minutes later it comes back with
a young girl for other black people.

511
00:31:23,401 --> 00:31:27,390
They sit down at the counter,
they want to know why you,

512
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:28,840
why Ali's wouldn't serve them.

513
00:31:29,090 --> 00:31:32,760
And they were taking notes and you're
quoted as saying they seem like

514
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:37,610
dictators. Yeah. In fact, they were,
they, uh, they were folks that came,

515
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:41,390
uh, and went around several places, uh,

516
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:46,790
just to test the law basically.
Yeah. And you were a,

517
00:31:46,791 --> 00:31:49,610
and you were turning those folks
away. Yes. You kicked them out.

518
00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:54,140
[inaudible] and why don't we
just, because that's way, uh,

519
00:31:54,170 --> 00:31:59,170
we had always done this way
until the law got adjudicated.

520
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:05,280
Uh, we weren't going to
unilaterally, uh, change, but they,

521
00:32:05,281 --> 00:32:06,410
you know, from their perspective,

522
00:32:06,411 --> 00:32:08,060
they're there because the
laws have been changed.

523
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:14,240
Yeah. Yes.

524
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:17,780
[inaudible]

525
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:19,940
Holly says right after the
Civil Rights Act was passed,

526
00:32:20,570 --> 00:32:22,820
sort of an emergency meeting was called of

527
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:26,180
the a Birmingham Restaurant
Association and he and his dad went

528
00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:30,690
when we, uh, discussed with the, um,
with them and with the executive of it,

529
00:32:30,691 --> 00:32:35,040
that this was going to be
such a potentially, uh,

530
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:39,620
harmful to the restaurant businesses.
Like you wouldn't lose all your customers.

531
00:32:39,621 --> 00:32:40,080
Is that what you

532
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,770
were worried about? I mean
that that was a possibility

533
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:48,160
and, uh, somebody out to do something. Uh,

534
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:52,500
and so we kind of ended up being
the ones to do something, uh,

535
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:53,740
if I file the suit.

536
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:57,530
So they filed a suit basically
saying to the federal government,

537
00:32:57,531 --> 00:33:02,531
you have no right to barge into our
small independent local business.

538
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:04,663
That was,

539
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:09,740
they can't really tell us what to do
because we're not an interstate business.

540
00:33:09,781 --> 00:33:13,440
And that's all that the federal government
regulates. And up until that point,

541
00:33:13,441 --> 00:33:15,150
that was all they had regulated.

542
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:20,030
The case went to the u s district court
for the northern district of Alabama.

543
00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:23,580
Uh, at the lower court level, the
three judge, special panel, uh,

544
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,780
we had a unanimous decision in our favor.

545
00:33:27,170 --> 00:33:31,910
The Alabama court agreed that there was
no interstate commerce happening here

546
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:34,580
and that Ali's did not
have to desegregate.

547
00:33:34,581 --> 00:33:36,140
They could sell their ribs
to whoever they wanted.

548
00:33:36,290 --> 00:33:38,240
And we were optimistic about that.

549
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:42,450
The government then appeals
and the case, as they say,

550
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,330
it goes all the way to the supreme court.

551
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:49,400
[inaudible]

552
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:49,611
all right.

553
00:33:49,611 --> 00:33:53,030
Let me now explain to you how the
government made this argument because they

554
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:53,400
made it. Yeah,

555
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:56,160
the court chief justice bad please. Carte

556
00:33:56,490 --> 00:33:57,960
October 5th, 1964

557
00:33:57,990 --> 00:33:58,823
second case

558
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:02,490
solicitor General Archibald Cox
gets up there and lays it out.

559
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:06,270
Why the government should be allowed to
use the commerce clause of all things to

560
00:34:06,271 --> 00:34:08,520
desegregate all these barbecue

561
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:12,580
that believes operate a
restaurant in Birmingham, Alabama,

562
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:15,370
specializing in barbecue meat.

563
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:18,740
He says this is a business that
sells and buys a lot of meat.

564
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:23,860
It's a 12 month period
prior to July one 1964 yeah,

565
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:27,220
pleas prices about $70,000 worth me.

566
00:34:27,490 --> 00:34:31,930
$69,683 to be exact. And where
do you think all that meat cake

567
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:36,380
is? That purchase from the Carmel
Company at is Birmingham, Alabama.

568
00:34:37,970 --> 00:34:39,640
All the beat sold that.

569
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:44,350
That came from other states so that
it moved and then it's big. Huh?

570
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:48,740
In other words, you think you're
a local business but you're not.

571
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:53,120
Meat is sourced from places other than
Alabama. And what about your ketchup?

572
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:58,130
Hypothetically, do you grow your
tomatoes in Alabama? No. Salt. Salt,

573
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:02,090
not mine in Alabama. So, even though
we bought it from a local vendor,

574
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:05,090
that local vendor probably bought it
from somebody who bought it from somebody

575
00:35:05,091 --> 00:35:06,440
that got it from out of state.

576
00:35:06,490 --> 00:35:09,410
They were reaching beyond what
had ever been done before.

577
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,740
Basically government was basically
telling the McClung is the same thing they

578
00:35:12,741 --> 00:35:13,790
told Roscoe Philbin

579
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:18,980
you are not an island. Well,

580
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:23,030
and that was only the government's first
argument. They had another argument

581
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:26,310
that was a second than still bar directly.

582
00:35:26,410 --> 00:35:27,640
That was even more

583
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:33,210
radical betray and racial discrimination
in restaurants at interstate commerce,

584
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:38,990
which is caused by the
artificial narrowing of the
consumer resulting from the

585
00:35:39,031 --> 00:35:40,450
explosion of big girl patient.

586
00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:43,180
So here's the argument, okay.

587
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:47,170
If you deny black people access
to restaurants and hotels,

588
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:50,890
you are effectively shutting
down interstate travel by them.

589
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:55,180
In parts of the country where
this practice is commonplace,

590
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,950
the entire deep south,

591
00:35:57,090 --> 00:36:00,960
you're limiting their ability to
cross state lines and and travel.

592
00:36:01,850 --> 00:36:06,560
The central argument says James Chen
is that when you discriminate against

593
00:36:06,561 --> 00:36:07,040
someone,

594
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:12,040
well as you create downstream negative,

595
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:14,360
uh, commercial effects, like,

596
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:18,710
like you create a chilling effect
because the person you're discriminating

597
00:36:18,711 --> 00:36:23,711
against is then less likely to travel
across state lines and spend money.

598
00:36:23,990 --> 00:36:28,970
So in effect, you are depressing
their future interstate commerce.

599
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:34,060
If you ask black people with this
experience from this time period,

600
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:40,840
they will universally say we never
left home unless every tire was triple

601
00:36:44,031 --> 00:36:44,864
checked.

602
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:49,870
Every belt was triple checked in the car
because we did not want to have the car

603
00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:56,360
breakdown in a hostile southern
town and get lynched. Right?

604
00:36:56,390 --> 00:36:57,140
Right.

605
00:36:57,140 --> 00:37:02,140
It is an entire system of travel
and commerce that's at stake here.

606
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:07,530
Essentially, the argument was
discrimination is bad for business.

607
00:37:07,531 --> 00:37:08,490
It's expensive.

608
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:13,920
And ultimately in a unanimous
decision, the Supreme Court,

609
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:15,241
same court,

610
00:37:15,241 --> 00:37:18,090
that a hundred years earlier had
basically gutted the 14th amendment.

611
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:23,120
The Supreme Court agreed
that a discrimination in
restaurants post significant

612
00:37:24,451 --> 00:37:28,860
burdens on the quote interstate flow of
food and upon the movement of products

613
00:37:28,890 --> 00:37:29,723
generally.

614
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:36,240
Do you remember that decision coming
down? Oh, certainly. Where were you?

615
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:41,940
Pause at work. Can you tell me a
little bit about how you and your dad

616
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:44,473
processed that decision?

617
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:49,530
We simply served anyone who
came in after that no problem.

618
00:37:50,130 --> 00:37:54,240
And they were, uh, the very next
day there was a group of local, uh,

619
00:37:54,270 --> 00:37:59,190
civil rights leaders who came in and
ate lunch a new, some of them. Ah,

620
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,620
I haven't seen them in the
news, that sort of thing.

621
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:06,900
They were not our regular customers for
then, nor after, frankly, but, uh, they

622
00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:11,010
celebrated or whatever you
want to say, uh, test it.

623
00:38:11,011 --> 00:38:13,410
I don't know what their motive was,
but they came in and ate lunch.

624
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:18,540
They got served just like anybody
else. They came in and it was fine.

625
00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:23,310
Sure. The law was, was
decided. So that was it.

626
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:27,560
Was it tense? No,

627
00:38:29,450 --> 00:38:34,040
other than the waitress who was waiting
on was, she was a little antsy about it.

628
00:38:34,310 --> 00:38:36,130
And was it this waitress,
was she a black woman?

629
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:40,710
Yes. No, I forget who it
was now, but she was like,

630
00:38:40,711 --> 00:38:43,640
most of our employees have been
there a very long time and, uh,

631
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:46,680
had never served other black folks, uh,

632
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:49,600
in a sit down situation. And,

633
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:54,780
and of course it was a little bit, uh,

634
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:59,370
I won't say upsetting but different.
She was a little hesitant at first. I,

635
00:38:59,371 --> 00:39:03,690
you know, told her, you know, Cisco
right-hand serve him and she did.

636
00:39:03,691 --> 00:39:06,210
And we did. And that was not a problem

637
00:39:07,370 --> 00:39:08,061
after the ruling.

638
00:39:08,061 --> 00:39:11,090
It's not as if a lot of black customers
suddenly started coming into Ollie's

639
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,180
BBQ. They didn't really
increase their blood.

640
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:17,290
Here's how a guy named Nathan
Turner Jr put it in 2014, uh,

641
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:20,960
he was interviewed for an NPR
piece. He grew up nearby. Ollie's,

642
00:39:21,050 --> 00:39:25,790
just the fact that all is pushed it that
far to take it to the supreme court.

643
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:29,600
It left a bad taste, pun intended,

644
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:33,590
in the mouths of a lot of
black people in Birmingham.

645
00:39:35,650 --> 00:39:40,600
Now, now 53 years later. How do you
think about that Supreme Court decision?

646
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:45,610
Well, yeah, if you're
asking me about segregation,

647
00:39:45,611 --> 00:39:48,940
that's one thing you asked me about
Supreme Court and the decision and the

648
00:39:48,941 --> 00:39:53,020
commerce clause. I still
disagree with, uh, uh,

649
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:57,040
let me put it real, real succinctly. Uh,

650
00:39:57,100 --> 00:40:02,100
I think what you had in that
decision was it rather than,

651
00:40:03,830 --> 00:40:07,090
and I think my civics is
correct, but I don't know,

652
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:09,660
rather than three quarters of the, uh,

653
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:13,840
Congress and three fifths of the states,

654
00:40:13,841 --> 00:40:17,650
I believe it is having two or maybe two
thirds of Congress, whichever it is,

655
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:22,690
having to vote to repeal an
amendment to the constitution.

656
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:27,610
Uh, you had basically nine appointees
who repeal the 10th amendment to the

657
00:40:27,611 --> 00:40:28,450
Constitution,

658
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:32,680
but 10th amendment basically says that
the powers not given to the feds are

659
00:40:32,681 --> 00:40:34,870
reserved for the states
and for the people.

660
00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:37,050
And that's about as
succinct as I can say it.

661
00:40:37,930 --> 00:40:40,240
Do you understand how this is going
to sound to a lot of our listeners,

662
00:40:40,690 --> 00:40:45,690
I mean that you are making a state's
rights argument as a not so veiled way to

663
00:40:46,331 --> 00:40:48,640
continue to discriminate
that really in the end,

664
00:40:48,641 --> 00:40:49,900
this is not about states' rights.

665
00:40:49,930 --> 00:40:52,210
I think that's going to how it's
going to sound to a lot of people.

666
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:57,630
Well, it may very well, but it's
not the case. Was there segregation?

667
00:40:57,690 --> 00:41:02,130
Yes. Uh, where we going to voluntarily,

668
00:41:03,270 --> 00:41:05,820
uh, in that, probably not.

669
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:09,900
Would we go back and reinstate
if we could? No, absolutely not.

670
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:15,740
But the issue that you're
talking about with the uh,

671
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:21,620
commerce clause and the constitutional
issue is still just what I said.

672
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:27,800
So you still believe 53 years later
that the supreme court got it wrong,

673
00:41:27,801 --> 00:41:32,600
that they should have never used the
commerce clause to make you desegregate

674
00:41:32,601 --> 00:41:33,890
Ollie's? Yep.

675
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:37,390
That is correct. But
don't hear me say that.

676
00:41:37,391 --> 00:41:40,310
I don't want to go back and have
segregation again. That's separate

677
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:43,240
[inaudible] issue. But is it separate
I guess is my question. You know, uh,

678
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:46,570
like I grant you, if you
think of it in the abstract,

679
00:41:47,470 --> 00:41:52,470
a federal government being
able to regulate commerce
across all boundaries is an

680
00:41:54,071 --> 00:41:57,800
enormous power and in it, and
it could be a scary Paris,

681
00:41:57,830 --> 00:42:02,830
I grant you that at the same time you
have a civil rights act that it speaks to

682
00:42:04,151 --> 00:42:06,430
a different amendment in
the constitution, right?

683
00:42:06,431 --> 00:42:08,890
And that you and your father
were not willing to follow.

684
00:42:08,891 --> 00:42:12,700
So how is the government going to get
you to pay attention and to get in line?

685
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:16,420
They've got to use the commerce
clause. So on some level isn't,

686
00:42:16,421 --> 00:42:21,421
it isn't the power present because the
other principles that would otherwise

687
00:42:23,051 --> 00:42:25,420
regulate your behavior
just aren't working.

688
00:42:26,550 --> 00:42:30,330
Well, that's, that's the
point. And you choose which,

689
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:34,290
which is the priority basically.

690
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:38,620
I don't understand that. You W W
which is the priority [inaudible]

691
00:42:38,950 --> 00:42:43,580
how well, which is the priority
of, uh, those amendments.

692
00:42:44,090 --> 00:42:44,923
Uh,

693
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:45,671
and so for you,

694
00:42:45,671 --> 00:42:49,270
the 10th amendment that grants states
rights for everything not enumerated,

695
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:54,520
outweighs the dignity of
black people. No, no, no,

696
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:58,990
no. We'll put, so say it to
me differently then. Well,

697
00:43:01,830 --> 00:43:05,460
the 10th amendment left
that to the states,

698
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:09,890
the fourth amendment. Yes.

699
00:43:10,130 --> 00:43:13,700
I think you meant to say the 14th
amendment gives people rights,

700
00:43:14,590 --> 00:43:18,780
everyone rights. But here's the
thing about rights and Scott,

701
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:22,820
kind of like the first law of
thermodynamics, there's only a,

702
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:27,340
and people don't realize this a lot of
times there are only so many rights and

703
00:43:27,430 --> 00:43:30,800
then only a finite number
of rights. If you take some,

704
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:36,170
give something to someone, they come
from someone else or somewhere else.

705
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:39,500
Now it's very well to say that

706
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:46,720
the end of segregation was a higher
right and more important right then the

707
00:43:51,110 --> 00:43:54,290
misuse of the commerce clause
or whatever you want to say.

708
00:43:55,550 --> 00:44:00,550
But u s but there's still a balance
and just which one you think is most

709
00:44:00,891 --> 00:44:05,570
important. Um, today's
parlance, we call it zero sum

710
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:12,220
[inaudible]

711
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:15,370
Ollie's basic point. We talked
about this for another hour,

712
00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:19,810
was it in achieving desegregation
that way, and by the way,

713
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:23,800
civil rights act of 64
dramatically altered the south.

714
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:27,250
It desegregated huge parts of the
south. But by doing it that way,

715
00:44:27,251 --> 00:44:31,980
he says with the commerce clause,
something was, he calls it

716
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:33,810
a zero sum, I wouldn't call it that.

717
00:44:34,110 --> 00:44:36,000
I don't think most people
would call it that.

718
00:44:36,990 --> 00:44:41,990
Treating people with dignity
inequality is a net win period.

719
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:45,270
[inaudible]

720
00:44:45,270 --> 00:44:48,150
but it is legitimately strange

721
00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:55,140
that the government had to take such a
roundabout ass backward way to fix this,

722
00:44:56,950 --> 00:44:58,540
to fix this grave injustice.

723
00:44:58,740 --> 00:44:59,140
What, what,

724
00:44:59,140 --> 00:45:03,460
what you would think would be the obvious
that you would go right to those civil

725
00:45:03,461 --> 00:45:07,330
rights parts of the constitution.
But it wasn't. It was the commerce.

726
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:08,980
That's weird. Is it? Yeah.

727
00:45:09,010 --> 00:45:13,390
We have the 14th amendment and yet we
go to the commerce clause for something.

728
00:45:13,391 --> 00:45:17,320
Yeah. That is so clearly stated
in one of the amendments.

729
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:19,990
So why it will lawyers are very tricky.

730
00:45:21,190 --> 00:45:22,810
This is Jamie Floyd again, by the way.

731
00:45:22,850 --> 00:45:26,900
And the lawyers in those cases that want,

732
00:45:26,901 --> 00:45:28,040
they wanted to win,

733
00:45:28,670 --> 00:45:33,140
they wanted to win more than they wanted
to make a social statement about equal

734
00:45:33,141 --> 00:45:37,070
justice, equal rights. The 14th
amendment. I mean those things mattered,

735
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:39,680
but most of all they wanted to win.

736
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:44,860
They wanted to shut down discrimination
at those lunch counters and if Congress

737
00:45:44,961 --> 00:45:49,880
could shut them down or require them to
open their doors to all Americans using

738
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:53,210
those 16 words, I'm okay with that.

739
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:56,360
Yeah. Yeah. No, I mean obviously the,

740
00:45:56,361 --> 00:46:00,530
if the ends do justify the means
in that case, but it does make you,

741
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:03,920
if you sort of put that case and the
wheat case in your mind as a kind of split

742
00:46:03,921 --> 00:46:06,640
screen. Yeah. It's,

743
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:10,910
it's a little strange because I do
think, okay, we have id. I mean,

744
00:46:11,690 --> 00:46:14,480
hopefully we're Americans with
principles that matter. You know,

745
00:46:14,481 --> 00:46:17,060
that we believe in equality.
We believe in racial justice,

746
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:22,790
but really we just believe in money
and we can do all the other stuff by

747
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:27,770
bootstrapping it to commerce. But
somehow as, as pure principles,

748
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:29,113
they what don't have

749
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:29,621
well,

750
00:46:29,621 --> 00:46:34,621
it's deeply troubling that we have to use
commerce to achieve our higher values.

751
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:39,020
That is weird to me. That is
fundamentally weird to me.

752
00:46:39,670 --> 00:46:40,550
And it's kind of cynical.

753
00:46:40,670 --> 00:46:44,300
Well yeah, I mean I, you are right.

754
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:48,940
We are at least in large part
about commerce in this country,

755
00:46:49,170 --> 00:46:51,030
but if that's who we are,

756
00:46:51,210 --> 00:46:55,440
then we should embrace it
and use it to our advantage.

757
00:46:55,770 --> 00:46:58,470
And if we can use it to our advantage,

758
00:46:58,471 --> 00:47:01,770
perhaps it does take us
to our higher principles.

759
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:04,770
Oh that's an interesting way of
looking at it. Yeah. It's not all bad.

760
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:09,760
[inaudible]

761
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:10,690
one of Jamie's points,

762
00:47:10,691 --> 00:47:13,390
which I hadn't actually thought
of was that legislating morality,

763
00:47:14,590 --> 00:47:17,890
legislating what is good and
what is bad doesn't always

764
00:47:18,110 --> 00:47:18,943
go well.

765
00:47:19,820 --> 00:47:21,380
Cause we very often don't agree.

766
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:26,470
I mean obviously there have been times
where people kept slaves and thought that

767
00:47:26,471 --> 00:47:27,304
was just fine.

768
00:47:28,580 --> 00:47:29,413
That was right.

769
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:30,960
[inaudible]

770
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:33,630
and for a hundred years you had
the 14th amendment in place,

771
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:37,850
but it couldn't solve Ollie's
BBQ. And here was a way

772
00:47:38,890 --> 00:47:39,520
[inaudible]

773
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:42,610
for the government without going
at the moral questions head on,

774
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,970
government could reach its hand all
the way into the barbecue joints in the

775
00:47:47,971 --> 00:47:49,740
hotels and the restaurants in the houses.

776
00:47:49,741 --> 00:47:53,880
And now the cake shops of America reach
its hand all the way down into the

777
00:47:53,881 --> 00:47:54,714
local.

778
00:47:56,850 --> 00:48:01,850
And it was because of this increasingly
expansive idea of commerce that was now

779
00:48:02,191 --> 00:48:05,630
no longer the buying and selling of
things or the not buying and selling and

780
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:10,300
things. It was now any
behavior they could create,

781
00:48:10,301 --> 00:48:11,830
a kind of butterfly effect

782
00:48:13,410 --> 00:48:15,990
that might one day,

783
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:19,440
many steps downstream have a future effect

784
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:21,273
on the bike.

785
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:27,980
So in that sense, Ollie
McClung was writing his case.
That was a massive shift.

786
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:34,710
It shifted totally the federal
government's role beyond business.

787
00:48:34,711 --> 00:48:37,530
Even if you think it's good,

788
00:48:37,531 --> 00:48:40,320
then that's fine and it's for the better.

789
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:45,440
But just ask to be realized that it was
a massive shift from the way that the

790
00:48:47,071 --> 00:48:49,830
country had been, uh, up before that time,

791
00:48:57,020 --> 00:48:58,010
after the McClung case.

792
00:48:58,011 --> 00:49:03,011
James Chen says service government use
of the commerce clause pretty much went

793
00:49:03,681 --> 00:49:07,850
wild. Yeah, there was just no real limit.

794
00:49:09,350 --> 00:49:10,850
They began to wave those 16 words,

795
00:49:10,970 --> 00:49:15,560
sort of like a magic wand to pass laws
on everything from fair labor standards

796
00:49:15,561 --> 00:49:20,561
to marijuana is a schedule one drugs gun
control act of 1968 guns sped justice

797
00:49:22,791 --> 00:49:25,160
for victims of trafficking,
sex trafficking,

798
00:49:25,220 --> 00:49:29,150
19,000 African lions in the
wild, dangerous species,

799
00:49:29,180 --> 00:49:33,560
1992 professional and Amateur
Sports Sports Protection Act,

800
00:49:33,590 --> 00:49:37,490
which forbids state authorized
sports, gambling, all kinds of things.

801
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:38,480
And in fact,

802
00:49:38,481 --> 00:49:42,680
the only question was whether the
government even had to make the argument

803
00:49:42,681 --> 00:49:45,710
itself, whether the governor
even has to defend itself.

804
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:49,040
James Chen says there were times
when the government would pass a law,

805
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:53,930
it'd get taken to court and the government
would basically not show up and they

806
00:49:53,931 --> 00:49:55,610
would still with, that's where we were.

807
00:49:55,611 --> 00:49:58,640
So we were arguing whether the
government even has to argue.

808
00:50:00,190 --> 00:50:03,820
So you can see the McClung case as
sort of a second big bang, but then

809
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:08,960
you get to the mid nineties at this point,

810
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:11,010
1994 you have a democratic president.

811
00:50:11,011 --> 00:50:16,011
Bill Clinton Democratic majorities in
both houses of Congress and together they

812
00:50:16,051 --> 00:50:18,060
pass the violence against women.

813
00:50:18,061 --> 00:50:22,770
Act today is the first day of Spring and
I think it's appropriate that we begin

814
00:50:22,771 --> 00:50:27,160
a new season of hope in the fight
against domestic violence. [inaudible]

815
00:50:30,650 --> 00:50:33,950
I'd like you all for being
here. This is an important day.

816
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:38,940
The act was sort of a sweeping rethink
of the federal government's role in

817
00:50:39,030 --> 00:50:43,590
trying to prevent violence against
women. It beefed up investigations, uh,

818
00:50:43,591 --> 00:50:45,870
of violent crimes against
women prosecutions.

819
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:50,020
It allowed women to sue their alleged
attackers in federal court. [inaudible]

820
00:50:50,220 --> 00:50:52,140
take responsibility.

821
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:55,980
Domestic violence is now the number one
health risk for women between the ages

822
00:50:55,981 --> 00:50:57,930
of 15 and 44 in our country.

823
00:50:58,340 --> 00:51:00,860
And the law was hinged
on the commerce clause.

824
00:51:00,861 --> 00:51:05,850
Same essential argument is in
the BBQ case that same fall.

825
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:09,510
My name is Christy Brown. Carla. I am 19
years old and I have lived in Fairfax,

826
00:51:09,511 --> 00:51:12,090
Virginia, most of my life.
A woman named Christy Brown.

827
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:15,780
Kala starts her freshman year at
Virginia Tech and just weeks in,

828
00:51:15,870 --> 00:51:19,860
in mid September, 1994 I was raped by
two football players in my own dorm.

829
00:51:20,290 --> 00:51:23,460
I had met them for the first time, just
15 minutes before they assaulted me.

830
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:27,930
These two football players she alleged
had raped her repeatedly on a single

831
00:51:27,930 --> 00:51:29,970
night. In 1984 I was raped three times.

832
00:51:30,060 --> 00:51:34,110
She went to the local campus
authorities. She told her story,

833
00:51:34,530 --> 00:51:36,750
college held their own hearings,
didn't go to the police.

834
00:51:37,110 --> 00:51:38,760
They suspended one of the two students.

835
00:51:38,850 --> 00:51:41,490
He appealed the other
one and when he returned,

836
00:51:42,580 --> 00:51:43,590
Krissy Bronco dropped out of school.

837
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:47,060
Oh,

838
00:51:47,710 --> 00:51:48,100
Christy Brown.

839
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:52,810
Kala ultimately decides to sue her alleged
attackers and the school under this

840
00:51:52,811 --> 00:51:56,050
new law. The violence against
Women Act and the case

841
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:58,850
ultimately makes it to the Supreme Court.

842
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:03,920
We'll hear argument now.
Number 99 five Kristi Brown,

843
00:52:04,310 --> 00:52:06,080
Kala versus Antonio Morrison

844
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:08,750
when Christie's case got to
the Supreme Court, her lawyer,

845
00:52:09,230 --> 00:52:13,580
MR chief justice and may it please the
court made the same argument about women

846
00:52:13,820 --> 00:52:16,640
that the government had made in the
Ollie's BBQ case about black people.

847
00:52:16,670 --> 00:52:18,470
One of the most discrimination,

848
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:23,240
or in this case outright violence has a
huge downstream effect on the economy.

849
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:28,300
A bipartisan Congress
concluded that gender based
violence substantially affects

850
00:52:28,311 --> 00:52:31,430
the national economy,
gender based violence,

851
00:52:31,610 --> 00:52:36,260
and the fear of that discriminatory
violence deters women's travel interstate

852
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:40,280
restricts women's choice of jobs
and ability to perform those jobs,

853
00:52:40,550 --> 00:52:45,260
reduces national productivity and
increases medical and other costs.

854
00:52:45,380 --> 00:52:45,771
And again,

855
00:52:45,771 --> 00:52:50,510
the court was given tons of evidence
about the economic effects sample congress

856
00:52:50,511 --> 00:52:53,930
heard from women whose batterers
kept their partners from working.

857
00:52:54,110 --> 00:52:58,760
They're shown data that every year this
costs the country billions of dollars.

858
00:52:58,761 --> 00:53:02,360
And that economic downstream effect
was not hard to prove in this case,

859
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:06,530
she dropped out. Well, especially if you
aggregate it right, it's not just her,

860
00:53:06,740 --> 00:53:11,480
it's everyone else who similarly situated.
But in this case, as I understand it,

861
00:53:11,481 --> 00:53:12,840
this law doesn't apply to any,

862
00:53:13,070 --> 00:53:15,620
any argument what's happening at a
very different time in the country,

863
00:53:15,621 --> 00:53:20,410
very different mood and in front of an
increasingly conservative supreme court

864
00:53:22,730 --> 00:53:26,550
that just wasn't buying it anymore.
Petitioner Bruise oncologists complaint

865
00:53:26,550 --> 00:53:29,280
alleges that she was the
victim of a brutal assault.

866
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:32,060
This is chief justice Rehnquist
reading the majority opinion.

867
00:53:32,230 --> 00:53:33,880
If the allegations are true,

868
00:53:33,910 --> 00:53:38,710
no civilized system of justice could fail
to provide her a remedy for Morrison's

869
00:53:38,711 --> 00:53:39,544
conduct,

870
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:44,230
but gender motivated crimes of violence
are not in any sense of the phrase

871
00:53:44,231 --> 00:53:45,550
economic activity.

872
00:53:49,070 --> 00:53:49,150
[inaudible].

873
00:53:49,150 --> 00:53:49,691
In other words,

874
00:53:49,691 --> 00:53:52,540
we're very sorry for what may have
happened to Christine Bronc Kala,

875
00:53:52,541 --> 00:53:55,600
but this is not commerce.
This is violence.

876
00:53:57,060 --> 00:53:58,930
The suggestion was, at
least in the Ali's case,

877
00:53:58,940 --> 00:54:01,510
there was something
being bought sold here.

878
00:54:02,260 --> 00:54:03,900
They felt like the length
of commerce was [inaudible]

879
00:54:05,110 --> 00:54:05,830
too thin.

880
00:54:05,830 --> 00:54:10,150
We accordingly reject the argument
that Congress may regulate noneconomic

881
00:54:10,151 --> 00:54:14,980
violent criminal conduct based solely
on that conduct's remote effect on

882
00:54:14,981 --> 00:54:16,270
interstate commerce.

883
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:21,720
Chief Justice Rehnquist got his majority
to start to chip away at the commerce

884
00:54:23,681 --> 00:54:25,900
power. Just a tiny, teeny,

885
00:54:25,901 --> 00:54:30,901
teeny weeny little bit and Jamie Floyd
says that attempt to roll it back

886
00:54:33,010 --> 00:54:36,880
continues its rolling
back. It is rolling back.

887
00:54:37,100 --> 00:54:38,710
It's still pretty powerful.
Don't get us wrong,

888
00:54:38,711 --> 00:54:41,650
but where we're left at the end of the day

889
00:54:43,350 --> 00:54:45,480
is in a really confusing place.

890
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:51,040
Ollie McClung excluding black
people from his dining room.

891
00:54:52,730 --> 00:54:55,720
Yeah, it's a commercial act. We
consider it reprehensible, but I,

892
00:54:55,910 --> 00:55:00,830
I would like to think that raping
Christine would be at least as bad.

893
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:02,660
Totally. I mean, do you see it?

894
00:55:02,661 --> 00:55:07,661
This is what this kind of like
absurd abstraction gets us to and in

895
00:55:11,690 --> 00:55:15,860
a coherent ideal world can't be right.

896
00:55:23,870 --> 00:55:24,110
[inaudible]

897
00:55:24,110 --> 00:55:26,000
I dunno when you, when the, when the,

898
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:31,720
the reasoning behind something gets a
little rocky than the soul of things gets,

899
00:55:33,260 --> 00:55:35,560
gets called into question.
What are you doing? Good.

900
00:55:36,340 --> 00:55:39,190
Yeah. For me, that's what happens
when you make everything about money.

901
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:43,320
Things get a little bit
rotten at their four.

902
00:55:47,370 --> 00:55:52,000
All right, so I'm gonna I just, before
I, uh, before I read the credits,

903
