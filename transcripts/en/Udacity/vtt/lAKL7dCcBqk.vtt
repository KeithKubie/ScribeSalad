00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:01.170
Hey, Charles.

00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:02.190
&gt;&gt; Hey, Michael.
How's it going?

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:03.160
&gt;&gt; How are you doing, Charles?

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:03.680
&gt;&gt; I'm doing great.

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:05.080
Guess who stopped by
the studio this morning?

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:06.967
&gt;&gt; Our T.A. from last year?

00:00:06.967 --> 00:00:11.060
&gt;&gt; Yes, Pushkar stopped by, and he
brought me ice cream which I am eating.

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.775
&gt;&gt; Good for you.

00:00:11.775 --> 00:00:13.217
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, just like old times.

00:00:13.217 --> 00:00:14.337
&gt;&gt; All the times.

00:00:14.337 --> 00:00:17.290
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Not just the old times.

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:17.927
&gt;&gt; And that's fair.

00:00:17.927 --> 00:00:18.970
So what are we going
to talk about today.

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:21.000
&gt;&gt; Well actually kind of in that same
vain this sort of idea that every time

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.670
that we record,
push cart seems Fair, that's fair.

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:23.740
So what are we going to
talk about today?

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:25.000
&gt;&gt; Well,
actually kind of in that same vein.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.220
The sort of idea that
every time that we record,

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.030
push cart seems to bring you ice cream
is an example of generalization.

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:28.660
&gt;&gt; Well done.
&gt;&gt; Thanks,

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.110
I can make predictions about what might
happen next time we record together

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.790
based on generalizing from the past
times that we've been together.

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:36.940
Even though it's kind
of a different state.

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.917
And so, the idea of generalization
is going to be to leveraged

00:00:41.917 --> 00:00:46.490
learning in states where
we've been to try to

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:49.480
make predictions about states where we
haven't been or haven't been very often.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.030
&gt;&gt; Well that sounds interesting so this
will allow us to teach Xs how to swim

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:54.470
for example looking at your pictures.

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:55.290
&gt;&gt; You don't like my pictures.

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:57.910
The idea of the picture here is
that we've got actual data points

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:59.600
these five Xs.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.200
But then we use this notion
of generalization to kind of

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.230
make predictions at places
where we don't have data.

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:06.180
&gt;&gt; So it's machine learning.

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.130
&gt;&gt; Yes, actually, very good point.

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:08.840
&gt;&gt; Cool.
All right.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:09.870
Well, I look forward to it.

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:11.560
&gt;&gt; So
this is the machine learning part, or

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.290
the generalization part of
reinforcement learning.

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:14.790
&gt;&gt; Excellent.
