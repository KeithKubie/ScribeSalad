00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:15.360
10 Signs and Symptoms of Hypersexual Disorder

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:18.020
What is Hypersexual Disorder?

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:21.380
According to a proposed definition for the DSMV,

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:24.440
it's defined as, "a sexual desire disorder,

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.040
with an impulsivity component".

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.480
In 2010, the American Psychiatric Association

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.380
released a draft of symptoms that may define sex addiction,

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.040
formerly known as Hypersexual Disorder.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.920
Number one: excessive masturbation.

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:46.420
Excessive masturbation is one of the most common early sex addiction signs.

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:52.140
Psych Central reports that it's about how you're living your life instead of how often you masturbate.

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:57.680
As long as the masturbation remains simply a part of your life, and does not take over daily activities,

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.760
then you don't have a problem.

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:05.800
People with Hypersexual Disorder often masturbate to escape problems in their lives or relationships

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.400
and they usually masturbate during other sexual activity,

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.020
like viewing pornography, or talking to a phone sex operator.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.940
2: Obsession with sex.

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.660
Hyspersexual Disorder causes its patients to become obsessed with sex

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:22.660
to the point that it takes over their lives.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:27.860
They spend an extraordinary amount of time fantasising about their sexual urges,

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.680
and engaging in sexual behaviour.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.080
Doctor Steven J Seay, a clinical psychologist in the U.S.,

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.340
explains that sexual obsessions are very common

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.680
in people suffering from Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD).

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.900
These sexual obsessions involve; unwanted thoughts,

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.940
ideas, impulses, or images focussing on sexual content.

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.180
While individuals with Hypersexual Disorder

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.980
feel guilt, shame, hopelessness, and depression,

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.180
individuals with OCD and sexual symptoms

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.320
see themselves as disgusting, deviant, or evil.

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.240
3. Excessive time planning sexual activity.

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.880
Just like drug addicts, sex addicts will spend a lot of time

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.080
figuring out where and how they will get their next fix.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.620
As Hypersexual Disorders puts it,

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.300
"this can also become harmful if it takes over other aspects of their lives.

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:26.660
For example, addicts usually prioritise planning sexual activity over work or personal relationships."

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.300
4. Frequent viewing of pornography.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.580
Whether it's videos, adult magazines, websites, chat rooms, or webcams,

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.340
people with Hypersexual Disorder view pornography in a variety of ways.

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.980
They may also use dating websites to connect with others who are interested in sexual relationships.

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.740
It is important to note, however, that porn addiction is not the same as sex addiction.

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:53.740
Porn addiction is a type of sex addiction,

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:56.420
but it has its own causes and symptoms,

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.420
independent from sex addiction.

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.060
According to PsychGuides.com

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.320
porn addiction is not yet an official diagnosis in the DSMV,

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.440
but it can lead to serious consequences.

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.160
5. Frequent use of phone sex services.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.320
Similar to pornography,

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:18.720
sex addicts will often turn to phone sex services to satisfy their needs.

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.660
This is because phone sex provides addicts with some form of human contact,

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.340
taking it a step further than masturbation and pornography.

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:32.220
The use of phone sex services can sometimes escalate into hiring prostitutes,

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.460
reckless sexual activity,

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:36.660
substance abuse during sexual activity,

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.300
sexual agression, or

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:41.680
dangerous sexual behaviour, like autoerotic asphyxiation.

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.000
6. Having multiple sex partners and frequent one-night stands.

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:48.880
In order to remain satisfied,

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.600
sex addicts often have multiple sex partners

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.600
and have frequent one-night stands.

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.620
This can be problematic,

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.660
as studies have shown that there is a correlation between the number of sex partners, and

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:01.660
one's mental health.

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:06.480
Interestingly, researchers have found that the chances of developing substance dependance

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.340
increased with the number of sex partners that participants had.

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:14.980
This correlational relationship was particularly stronger in women.

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.820
However, the researchers also noted that

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:22.320
casual relationships usually stemmed from lack of emotional fulfilment.

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:26.800
Thus, people in these relationships may turn to substance abuse to self-medicate.

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:31.240
7. Staying emotionally detached from sexual partners.

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.380
Sex addicts are unable to establish and maintain

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.840
normal, healthy connections with their partners.

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.960
So they often avoid becoming emotionally attached to their sexual partners.

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:46.320
A survey done of more than one thousand people in 2013

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.040
showed that having an emotional connection makes better sex.

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:55.000
However, sex addicts lack the emotional intimacy and vulnerability

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.900
that is needed to develop a real connection,

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:03.020
so they often have mindless, meaningless, emotionless sex with their sexual partners.

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:08.900
8. Engaging in sexual behaviour that directly conflicts with personal values.

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:13.100
The McKinley Health Centre states that it is extremely

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:16.220
important to know what your sexual values are.

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:19.780
Which may not match those of your parents, religion, or culture.

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:23.840
For sex addicts, this causes a strong internal conflict.

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:27.280
While some sex addicts may be devoutly religious,

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.880
they will still find it hard to stop and resist

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.660
sexual activity because they are highly addicted.

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:35.360
This causes a cycle where they cannot stop,

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:39.460
but continue to engage in sexual activity to fulfil their needs.

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:44.580
They might even progress into having multiple partners or extramarital partners,

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:47.780
frequent one-night stands, and sex with prostitutes.

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:51.900
9. Frequently engaging in paraphilias

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:55.560
Sex addicts often engage in paraphilias,

00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:00.180
which are sexual behaviours that are considered unusual or unacceptable.

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:03.840
These include, exhibitionism, voyeurism, sadism,

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:06.380
masochism, and pedophilia.

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:13.380
Exhibitionism involves exposing one's genitals or sexual organs to a stranger, according to Psychology Today.

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:18.100
Voyeurism involves having sexual fantasies, urges, or behaviours

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:21.040
regarding the act of observing a person who is naked,

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:24.180
getting undressed, or engaging in sexual activities.

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:29.680
Voyeurism became formerly known as Voyeuristic Disorder in the DSMIV

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:36.860
Sadomasochism is sexual activity in which one person enjoys inflicting pain on another person,

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:39.820
who derives pleasure from experiencing pain.

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:45.080
Lastly, pedophilia is when one experiences sexual feelings towards children.

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:48.600
10. Inability to stop

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:51.780
One of the primary signs of a sex addict is

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:54.760
an inability to stop despite the consequences.

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:58.220
These consequences may be financial, social, health,

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:00.540
or emotionally related.

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:04.820
For example, being addicted to sex could begin to affect performance at work,

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:07.460
which could result in unemployment.

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:10.660
Being addicted to sex is also a costly addiction

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:13.380
because addicts spend on sex through prostitution,

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:16.760
online sex services, like sexual fantasy chatrooms,

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:18.760
or phone sex services.

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:20.740
In terms of health consequences,

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:25.740
sex addicts' promiscuity can lead to unwanted pregnancy or STDs

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:29.580
Hypersexual Disorder or sex addiction is a serious disorder

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:33.040
that affects nearly 12 million people in the United States

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:38.480
This number is increasing due to the availability of sexual material online,

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:42.420
as well as the increase in sexual chat rooms and web time services.

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:45.420
If you're suffering from Hypersexual Disorder,

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:47.420
or if you know someone who is,

00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:51.860
