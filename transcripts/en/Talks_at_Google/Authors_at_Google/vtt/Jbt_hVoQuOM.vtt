[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:00:10.468 --> 00:00:13.090
-Successful people
make it look so easy,

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:16.605
but they never said it was.

00:00:16.605 --> 00:00:19.740
He was rejected by
Harvard Business School.

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.480
Warren Buffett is now the most
successful investor in history.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.985
He was fired from 4 jobs and
forced to live in his car

00:00:28.985 --> 00:00:32.350
on $2.50 a day.

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:34.840
John Paul Dejoria, co-founder
of the Patron Spirits

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.065
Company and John Paul
Mitchell hair systems.

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:42.560
After bombing the law school
admissions test twice,

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.990
she spent 8 years working
for a company that

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:48.500
sold fax machines door to door.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.170
Sara Blakely founded the
shapewear company, Spanx,

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:52.265
and is now a billionaire.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.800
He pitched his television
show to everyone,

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.060
but it was rejected
all over Hollywood.

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.750
Matthew Weiner's "Mad Men"
finally made to the screen,

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.550
seven years after
it was written.

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.420
In her teens, she was
tormented and bullied

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.990
for being overweight.

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.730
Jillian Michaels now runs a
health and wellness empire.

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:20.680
After starting his own
architectural practice,

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.250
he was on the verge of
bankruptcy for years.

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.130
Frank Gehry is one of the
most important architects

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.160
of our age.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.930
After years of failed attempts,
this former swimsuit model

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:37.380
finally launched her own
brand with a line of socks.

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.990
Kathy Ireland's name now
graces over 15,000 products.

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.980
Yep, she's bigger
than Martha Stewart.

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:49.200
He was kicked out of 9
schools and repeatedly told

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.280
that he would end up in prison.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.470
Hans Zimmer is one of the
most successful composers

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.010
of our time.

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:59.020
Ever seen "The Lion King?"

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:00.920
How do they do it?

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.290
Find out, and
learn their secrets

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:07.774
in "Getting There, A Book of
Mentors," by Gillian Zoe Segal.

00:02:07.774 --> 00:02:10.009
[END PLAYBACK]

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.730
GILLIAN ZOE SEGAL: So why
did I write this book?

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.010
There's a common misperception
that highly successful people

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.840
were practically born
that way, that they either

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.150
had a meteoric rise to the
top, or at the very least,

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.860
enjoyed some smooth,
steady climb.

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.640
And the truth couldn't
be further from this.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.570
But even when you
know this, you still

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.590
can't help but
look at a luminary

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.880
and imagine that he or she
had a somewhat easier time

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.430
than you might have
getting to where they are.

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.160
And even if you know that
that person encountered

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.750
specific obstacles, you imagine
that those obstacles probably

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.410
didn't faze them that much.

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.770
Now, conversely, when you
are working towards something

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:01.040
and you encounter
an obstacle when

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.470
you fail or you
get rejected, it's

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.020
easy to blow that
out of proportion.

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:09.920
It's easy to get depressed.

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.210
It's easy to get
discouraged, and it's

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:16.110
easy to let those emotions
take you off track.

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:19.670
So what do you do about this?

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.220
The best way to ensure that
you persevere and reach

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.240
your own potential
is to get inspiration

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:30.390
from the lives and careers of
people who you really admire.

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.380
Learn details about
the difficulties

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.450
that these people
encountered and see how

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.930
they were able to move forward.

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.150
Then, make a point of recalling
these lessons and anecdotes

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:44.950
when you need a boost.

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:48.710
So this is what I set out
to provide with my book,

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:50.130
"Getting There."

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:54.460
I sat down with 30 leaders
from a broad variety of fields,

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:58.620
and I got as personal as
they would let me get.

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.900
I asked them to let their guards
down and share their stories.

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.480
And I asked them to tell
me about their lowest

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:10.220
lows and the lessons they
learned from their journey.

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:14.470
I also asked them to distill
the best advice and wisdom

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:16.290
that they had to offer.

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:19.100
And while I was added,
I also photographed

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:20.839
each of these
people, because who

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:23.370
doesn't like a book with
some pictures in it?

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.450
It makes it easier to
relate to the people.

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:32.370
So before I really get
into the meat of the book,

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:33.930
I just want to say
one thing, which

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.400
is that no one knows it all.

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.490
And what speaks to
me in these essays

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:44.320
might be different than
what speaks to you or you.

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.350
We all need help
in different areas.

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:51.540
And one of the nicest things
recently that's happened

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:53.750
is that I sent a copy
of "Getting There"

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:56.220
to each of the 30
subjects in the book.

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.936
And so many of
them got back to me

00:04:58.936 --> 00:05:00.560
and told me how much
they were enjoying

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.400
reading each other's
stories, and that they

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.110
were learning from each other.

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:07.140
So after that
feedback, I can feel

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.050
confident in saying
that there's something

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:10.390
in the book for anybody.

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:14.760
Warren Buffett.

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:19.380
As you saw in the video, he got
rejected from Harvard Business

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:20.570
School.

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:23.180
But there's more.

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:24.900
He's had a harder
times than that.

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:29.350
Up until the age of 20, he
was petrified of speaking

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:30.900
in public.

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:33.570
This was so bad that
he would literally

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:36.930
arrange his whole life so that
he never had to find himself

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:38.260
in front of a crowd.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:42.010
And if he did have
to speak in public,

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:46.240
he would literally throw
up before doing so.

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:49.530
So when he was 20, he decided
he had to get over this,

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:52.880
and he signed up for a Dale
Carnegie public speaking

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:53.620
course.

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:56.000
And this changed his life.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:02.630
If you go to his office, he
has his $100 course certificate

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:05.410
from the Dale Carnegie
School framed on his wall.

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:07.550
And he has nothing
else-- no other diplomas,

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:11.480
because he says that that
course has had the biggest

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:16.790
impact on his subsequent success
than any other degree he has.

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:20.200
Well, to say that Warren
Buffett is a wealth of wisdom

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:21.930
is an understatement.

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:25.490
His essay has so
many amazing lessons.

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:30.570
But I'm just going to talk
about a couple of them

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:33.530
so we can get to other
people in the book.

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:36.940
One of the things
that Warren taught me

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:41.370
is that you can always tell
someone to go to hell tomorrow.

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:43.830
And this is a piece
of advice that he

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:46.890
got from a friend of
his about 50 years ago.

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:48.960
And he says its one of
the most valuable things

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:49.820
he's ever learned.

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:54.260
And I have to say that out of
all the tidbits in my book,

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:58.880
it's probably the one bit of
advice that I pass on the most

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:00.630
frequently.

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:05.340
The point of it is that you
should refrain from spouting

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:07.120
off in a moment of anger.

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:10.100
When you do that, you
often say something

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:12.750
that you might regret,
and you can't take back.

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:16.120
So Warren says, just
forget about it for a day.

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:20.322
If you feel the same way
tomorrow, tell them then.

00:07:20.322 --> 00:07:21.780
You haven't missed
the opportunity.

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:27.510
Warren also talked
about passion.

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:32.510
And this is something that
almost everybody in my book

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:33.310
talked about.

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:36.780
So I'm going to bring it up
now and get it over with.

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:38.770
They all say that you
should pursue something

00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:40.820
that you're passionate about.

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:43.642
And the reason why is
because nothing is easy.

00:07:43.642 --> 00:07:45.850
And if you're not passionate
about what you're doing,

00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:50.130
you'll never have the fuel to
jump the inevitable hurdles

00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:52.130
that you're going to encounter.

00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:54.920
They also say that you
should not do something just

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:57.692
for the money, or you
shouldn't do something

00:07:57.692 --> 00:07:58.900
because you think you should.

00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:00.970
Because if you go
down that road,

00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:04.200
it probably won't end very well.

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:08.110
Hans Zimmer, who is
a famous composer,

00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:10.710
he discussed the subject
during our interview.

00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:14.450
And he said, whenever I need
legal or medical advice,

00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:17.150
I go announce my
problems to my orchestra.

00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:19.570
Half are doctors, and half
are lawyers whose parents

00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:22.810
forced them into those jobs.

00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:26.326
So Warren Buffett takes this
passion thing a step further.

00:08:26.326 --> 00:08:28.200
And he says, not only
should you do something

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:30.200
you're passionate
about, but it's also

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:33.640
important to understand your
strengths and weaknesses,

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:35.490
and do something
within what he calls,

00:08:35.490 --> 00:08:37.690
your circle of competence.

00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:40.600
So he says that knowing
what to leave out

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:43.630
is as important as
knowing what to focus on.

00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:46.300
And he quotes his
friend, Tom Watson,

00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:51.200
who's the founder of IBM
who said, I'm no genius.

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:54.305
But I'm smart in spots, and
I stay around those spots.

00:08:57.630 --> 00:09:00.490
An example of someone
who was fortunate enough

00:09:00.490 --> 00:09:03.820
to discover his
circle of competence

00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:06.870
is Nitin Nohria, who is
the current dean of Harvard

00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:09.200
Business School.

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:13.020
He grew up in India, in a
typical, middle class family.

00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:15.480
And his parents
wanted him to become

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:18.080
either a doctor or an engineer.

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:20.830
So he decided to
become an engineer,

00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:24.720
and he applied for the most
prestigious school there, which

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:27.640
is IIT.

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:32.080
And we have a
graduate of IIT here.

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:38.590
So anyway, Nitin did not
get in on his first try,

00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:41.080
which was a very traumatic
experience for him.

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:42.820
But he did get in
on his second try.

00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:45.010
And when he finally
got to school, he says,

00:09:45.010 --> 00:09:48.230
he managed to become a
pretty decent student.

00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:50.880
But he would look around,
and there were people there

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:53.550
who could do things
in their sleep

00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:57.230
that he couldn't do, no
matter how hard he tried.

00:09:57.230 --> 00:10:02.410
And so after IIT, he went
to MIT to study finance.

00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:04.380
And the same thing happened.

00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:07.320
So finally, after a lot
of internal struggle,

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:10.310
he allowed himself to
change paths and pursue

00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:11.670
something less technical.

00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:15.720
He became a professor,
and the rest is history.

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:17.820
He rose right to the
top of his field,

00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:20.160
and he's the dean of Harvard.

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:22.370
And he wants to
make a point though.

00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:23.940
He wants to make
sure that the lesson

00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:26.310
to take away from
his story is not

00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:30.480
to change paths the moment you
discover something's difficult,

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:32.570
because if you give
up at first blush,

00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:34.270
you'll never
succeed at anything,

00:10:34.270 --> 00:10:36.830
because nothing
worth doing is easy.

00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:43.395
As much as any of you
love it here at Google,

00:10:43.395 --> 00:10:45.020
and as long as you've
been here, and as

00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:49.930
well as you think you're doing
here, you might get fired.

00:10:49.930 --> 00:10:52.920
Why am I bringing this up with
a picture of Michael Bloomberg

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:53.940
right there?

00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:57.000
Because that happened to him.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.490
Michael Bloomberg is now one of
the richest men in the world,

00:11:00.490 --> 00:11:04.660
and he is the founder
of Bloomberg LP.

00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:06.800
And he also is the
mayor of New York City

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:08.870
for three consecutive terms.

00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:12.640
But before all of that, he
worked at Salomon Brothers.

00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:14.200
And he loved it.

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:16.310
He was there for 15 years.

00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:17.930
He thought he was doing great.

00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:19.770
But the company got sold.

00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:23.100
They restructured,
and he got the boot.

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:25.840
No one came running to
offer him another job,

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:28.930
so he decided that he would
just start his own company.

00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:33.110
And that's how
Bloomberg was born.

00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:36.980
And one thing that really struck
me about him in our interview

00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:39.980
is that we all know
that to get anywhere,

00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:41.180
you have to work hard.

00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:45.860
But he really gave working
hard a new meaning.

00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:55.570
Even after he got
fired from Salomon,

00:11:55.570 --> 00:11:58.830
he still had about two
months left before he

00:11:58.830 --> 00:12:00.550
was going to leave the company.

00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:04.180
And he made sure to still
work six days a week

00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:06.680
from as early in the morning
until as late as he could.

00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:09.560
He was even looking for
office space during that time.

00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:11.540
And he told the broker
that he could only

00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:16.770
look on weekends, because he
didn't want anyone to ever say

00:12:16.770 --> 00:12:19.090
that he didn't work 110%.

00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:22.990
He said he had an ego
problem with that.

00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:26.910
So something that a lot of
people in my book demonstrate

00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:28.890
is the careers have chapters.

00:12:28.890 --> 00:12:32.010
And even if it's not
because you got fired,

00:12:32.010 --> 00:12:34.600
what you're doing
right now might not

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:38.670
be what you're going to be
doing a few years from now.

00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:41.220
You do not need to have
everything mapped out.

00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:44.080
But the subjects in my book
say that the important thing

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:46.580
is to always keep your eyes
open for new possibilities.

00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:54.120
Leslie Moonves is the
president and CEO of CBS.

00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:56.790
He began his career as an actor.

00:12:56.790 --> 00:13:00.500
But at a certain point, he
got sick of being a bartender

00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:01.670
to make ends meet.

00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:03.590
And then he realized
that he'd actually

00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:06.970
prefer being on the
other side of the camera.

00:13:06.970 --> 00:13:10.290
And he says that if
your path is too rigid,

00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:12.800
you're likely to miss
out on opportunities.

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:16.670
You have to be fluid
and open to change.

00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:20.790
Jillian Michaels, who now runs
a health and wellness empire,

00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:23.490
she only devoted
herself to her field

00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:27.680
after being fired
as a talent agent.

00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:31.780
And Kathy Ireland started
out her career as a model,

00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:34.741
and she became a very successful
"Sports Illustrated" swimsuit

00:13:34.741 --> 00:13:35.240
model.

00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:38.850
And she now runs a $2
billion a year business,

00:13:38.850 --> 00:13:41.410
and it's called kathy
ireland Worldwide.

00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:44.730
And her name graces
over 15,000 products.

00:13:44.730 --> 00:13:48.270
A lot of people look
at her and think,

00:13:48.270 --> 00:13:51.640
if I was born looking like
that, or if I had been a "Sports

00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:55.000
Illustrated" swimsuit model, I
could slap my name on products

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.280
and make a lot of money too.

00:13:57.280 --> 00:13:58.720
But that is not the case.

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:05.550
So before Kathy finally hit it,
she tried and failed for years.

00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:09.390
She tried a skin care
line, a beer company,

00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:11.000
several different art projects.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.280
They all flopped.

00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:15.170
And finally, she was
able to launch her brand

00:14:15.170 --> 00:14:18.900
with of all things, a pair of
socks-- Kathy Ireland socks.

00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:21.150
But just because
it launched doesn't

00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:22.630
mean it was easy either.

00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:26.440
She talks in her essay
about traveling around

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:29.650
with her backpack and sleeping
in airports to save money.

00:14:29.650 --> 00:14:32.870
And she also talks about a
time when her company almost

00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:35.090
went bankrupt.

00:14:35.090 --> 00:14:38.200
Kathy says that a lot of
times, people come up to her,

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:40.180
and they tell her
about a business idea

00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:42.470
that they started,
but then they stopped,

00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:44.910
because either someone
they knew didn't

00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:48.950
think it was such a smart idea,
or they faced some rejection.

00:14:48.950 --> 00:14:52.870
And she says to them, you
stopped because of that?

00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:57.390
"If you never fail it means
you're not trying hard enough."

00:14:57.390 --> 00:15:03.030
And that is a another
big theme in the book.

00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:06.840
My subjects all say that
you should not be paralyzed

00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:08.920
by the fear of failure.

00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:10.440
Everyone fails,
and you just have

00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:14.740
to think of it as
part of the process.

00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:19.980
So John Paul Dejoria-- he is the
founder of John Paul Mitchell

00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:23.650
systems, which is a super
successful line of hair care

00:15:23.650 --> 00:15:24.420
products.

00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:28.500
And he is also the founder
of the Patron Spirits Company

00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:31.800
that makes the
delicious tequila.

00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:35.170
He grew up without much money.

00:15:35.170 --> 00:15:37.400
And when I say
without much money,

00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:40.660
his father left the
family when he was two,

00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:43.420
and so it was just him, and
his brother, and his mother.

00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:46.570
And he remembers a time when
between the three of them,

00:15:46.570 --> 00:15:48.760
they had $0.27.

00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:51.320
So he never went to college.

00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:53.140
He went to the Navy
instead, because he

00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:55.110
had no money to go to college.

00:15:55.110 --> 00:15:57.740
And then he had a series
of different jobs.

00:15:57.740 --> 00:16:01.100
And he also got fired from
a series of different jobs.

00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:05.510
And he ended up living in
his car on $2.50 a day.

00:16:05.510 --> 00:16:07.840
And in the essay,
he describes how

00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:10.140
he worked that,
where he showered,

00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:13.190
what he had for breakfast,
what he had for dinner.

00:16:13.190 --> 00:16:15.740
But one of the most
surprising things

00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:18.540
I found in putting
this book together

00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:22.630
was how many of these
really successful people

00:16:22.630 --> 00:16:27.220
credited early jobs in
sales for giving them

00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:30.050
the skills they needed for
their ultimate success.

00:16:30.050 --> 00:16:33.710
And John Paul Dejoria
is an example of that.

00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:37.330
One of his early jobs
was selling encyclopedias

00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:38.060
door to door.

00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:40.440
And he did this for three years.

00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:44.710
And he says it was one of the
most formative experiences

00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:47.720
of his life, and says that
if that job existed today,

00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:50.880
he would make every one
of his children do it.

00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:54.950
What he had to do was go
around, knock on doors,

00:16:54.950 --> 00:16:58.610
convince people to the first
to let him make a presentation,

00:16:58.610 --> 00:17:00.070
and then he would
try to convince

00:17:00.070 --> 00:17:04.849
them to buy a set of
encyclopedias for their family.

00:17:04.849 --> 00:17:07.640
And a lot of doors got
slammed in his face.

00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:10.755
So this taught him to
overcome rejection,

00:17:10.755 --> 00:17:17.410
and it also taught him to really
hone his powers of persuasion.

00:17:17.410 --> 00:17:18.790
He explains that
after you've had

00:17:18.790 --> 00:17:20.550
15 doors slammed
in your face, you

00:17:20.550 --> 00:17:24.280
need to be as enthusiastic
at the 16th door

00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:27.960
as you were at the first door
if you want to make a sale.

00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:31.730
And when he ultimately launched
his first successful business,

00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:34.540
which was the John
Paul Mitchell systems,

00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:37.760
he relied on these skills
to make it a success.

00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:40.710
He went from beauty
salon to beauty salon,

00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:44.320
convincing them to
try buy his product.

00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:49.750
And he says that at least 4
out of 5 turned them down.

00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:52.200
But he knew better than to
let that discourage him.

00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:58.780
Another person who obviously
did not let failure or rejection

00:17:58.780 --> 00:18:01.810
paralyze him is Matthew Weiner.

00:18:01.810 --> 00:18:05.610
And he is the creator of
the hit TV show, "Mad Men."

00:18:05.610 --> 00:18:07.270
And as you saw on
the video, that

00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:10.780
was rejected all over Hollywood,
and it took seven years

00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:14.920
from the time he wrote it
until when it was onscreen.

00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:20.190
But that was not his only
experience with rejection.

00:18:20.190 --> 00:18:23.550
Well, Matt went to
USC Film School.

00:18:23.550 --> 00:18:26.210
And when he graduated,
he could not get a job.

00:18:26.210 --> 00:18:28.940
And he couldn't
even get a meeting

00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:32.080
with an agent who would
try to find him a job.

00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:37.120
So he spent three years
writing spec scripts from home.

00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:40.760
I'm going to read the way
he describes those years.

00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:44.080
He said, my friends had
day jobs, but I didn't.

00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:47.460
My wife, Linda, worked hard as
an architect and supported us.

00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:51.050
I attempted to shop my material
around, but nothing sold.

00:18:51.050 --> 00:18:54.040
I got very bitter seeing
people I didn't think

00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:55.800
deserved it succeed.

00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:57.390
It was a dark time.

00:18:57.390 --> 00:18:59.750
Show business looked
so impenetrable

00:18:59.750 --> 00:19:01.770
that I eventually
stopped writing.

00:19:01.770 --> 00:19:04.960
I begin watching TV all
day and lying about it.

00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:07.260
My mother would call me
to drive my brother-in-law

00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:08.460
to the airport.

00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:10.380
That's the kind of
crap I was doing

00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:11.810
instead of being a writer.

00:19:11.810 --> 00:19:16.730
I felt like the most useless,
worthless person in the world.

00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:21.000
Well, Matt also gave some
advice that I'm going to share.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.540
I'll share just
two pieces of it.

00:19:22.540 --> 00:19:26.270
The first is something that
might seem really basic.

00:19:26.270 --> 00:19:29.450
But Matt says that it took
him forever to get this.

00:19:29.450 --> 00:19:32.760
And it's just when you have
a meeting with somebody,

00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:35.170
look that person up,
and now everything

00:19:35.170 --> 00:19:36.500
you can about him or her.

00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:39.520
It's pretty effortless,
and it can pay dividends.

00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:42.400
The other piece of
advice I'm going to share

00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:45.370
is he says when someone
rejects your work,

00:19:45.370 --> 00:19:48.820
you have to listen to the
fact that they don't like it.

00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:51.370
But don't listen
to the reason why.

00:19:51.370 --> 00:19:54.270
And he says that a
lot of times, people

00:19:54.270 --> 00:19:56.740
feel like they have
to say something.

00:19:56.740 --> 00:19:58.500
But they don't want
to hurt your feelings,

00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:03.080
so they give some kind
of a capricious reason.

00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:06.510
And if you alter your
work for every rejection,

00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:09.250
you're just going to go running
in all different directions

00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:12.440
trying to please an
imaginary audience.

00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:15.680
And that can be damaging
and destructive.

00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:18.540
So with "Mad Men,"
Matt stuck to his guns.

00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:20.200
And what ended up
on the screen is

00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:23.240
what he had originally
planned, and what

00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:25.740
had been rejected for years.

00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:30.740
David Boies is one of the
world's most highly acclaimed

00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:32.360
attornies.

00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:36.600
A case he was in that was
relevant to you here at Google

00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:39.560
is that he represented the
US Department of Justice

00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:44.270
in its successful antitrust
suit against Microsoft.

00:20:44.270 --> 00:20:46.940
He has a surprising history.

00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:49.540
First, David suffers
from dyslexia

00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:52.230
and couldn't read until
he was in third grade.

00:20:52.230 --> 00:20:54.660
And then when he
graduated high school,

00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:57.310
he had no intention
of going to college.

00:20:57.310 --> 00:21:00.480
He just wanted to live
a carefree lifestyle.

00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:02.170
He wanted to surf.

00:21:02.170 --> 00:21:05.940
So he got jobs in
construction to make money.

00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:10.520
And basically, he made the
most money from playing cards.

00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:15.400
And this changed when
his wife got pregnant.

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:20.430
And she nudged him to get a
little bit more responsible.

00:21:20.430 --> 00:21:22.860
And that's when he
went to law school,

00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:27.590
and the rest is
history with him too.

00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:31.540
But basically, his field
has a lot of ups and down.

00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:33.780
He has won a lot of
great cases, and he

00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:35.420
has lost a lot of great cases.

00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:37.105
So I talked to him about this.

00:21:37.105 --> 00:21:39.070
And he gave me some
advice that I really

00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:42.360
like, because it's applicable
to all aspects of life

00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:43.200
and all careers.

00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:45.460
And he said, no
matter what you do,

00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:47.190
there will be times
when things go well,

00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:48.980
and times when things go badly.

00:21:48.980 --> 00:21:51.790
The only thing for
sure in either scenario

00:21:51.790 --> 00:21:53.590
is that things will change.

00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:56.550
When something good
happens, I try to enjoy it.

00:21:56.550 --> 00:21:58.340
When something
bad happens, I try

00:21:58.340 --> 00:22:00.600
to understand why it happened.

00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:05.300
But in either case, the next
day, I'm onto something else.

00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:07.830
So keep up that forward motion.

00:22:07.830 --> 00:22:12.620
None of the subjects in my
book allow them themselves

00:22:12.620 --> 00:22:15.670
to wallow for too
long in anything.

00:22:15.670 --> 00:22:18.090
They all try to learn
something from their mistakes

00:22:18.090 --> 00:22:19.220
and failure.

00:22:19.220 --> 00:22:22.300
And then they just move on.

00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:26.500
So unlike David Boies,
this is Sara Blakely.

00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:30.830
And her whole life was geared
towards being a lawyer.

00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:32.450
Her father was a trial attorney.

00:22:32.450 --> 00:22:35.720
She used to take days off of
school to go watch him in court

00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:36.980
and take notes.

00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:40.970
She joined the debate team
so that her law school

00:22:40.970 --> 00:22:44.480
application would look
good, and she'd be prepared.

00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:48.310
And then when the time finally
came for her to take the LSAT,

00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:50.120
she bombed it.

00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:56.050
So she took a course,
studied as hard as she could.

00:22:56.050 --> 00:22:59.390
Took it again, and she
did one point worse.

00:22:59.390 --> 00:23:04.510
So after this, Sarah got a
job loading rides at Disney.

00:23:04.510 --> 00:23:08.350
And then she spent eight years
working for a company that

00:23:08.350 --> 00:23:10.900
sold fax machines door to door.

00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:14.020
She's another one who
talks about the benefits

00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:15.200
that this gave her.

00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:19.070
But one thing that she
talked about in her essay

00:23:19.070 --> 00:23:21.550
that I'm going to share
with you is she talk

00:23:21.550 --> 00:23:24.860
about the important--
well, I need to get back

00:23:24.860 --> 00:23:27.580
to what she actually did.

00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:31.930
One day, while she was
working for the company that

00:23:31.930 --> 00:23:34.780
sold fax machines
door to door, she

00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:39.280
saw that her butt didn't look
so good in her white pants.

00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:41.720
So she wished that
she had something

00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:45.310
like control-top pantyhose that
she could wear underneath them,

00:23:45.310 --> 00:23:49.480
but without the whole
leg part; without feet.

00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:51.730
So she invented that product.

00:23:51.730 --> 00:23:53.840
It's now called Spanx.

00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:57.370
I can't imagine that any
woman in this audience

00:23:57.370 --> 00:24:02.270
doesn't know what
Spanx is, and it's

00:24:02.270 --> 00:24:04.760
been joked about and publicized.

00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:06.640
She was actually on
the cover of "Forbes,"

00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:09.230
because she's a billionaire
from this product.

00:24:09.230 --> 00:24:10.890
So she talks about
the importance

00:24:10.890 --> 00:24:13.260
of keeping a young idea secret.

00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:15.130
And she explains
that because ideas

00:24:15.130 --> 00:24:18.630
are the most vulnerable at
the moment you have them,

00:24:18.630 --> 00:24:21.750
hearing discouraging remarks
early on will likely take you

00:24:21.750 --> 00:24:22.850
off course.

00:24:22.850 --> 00:24:25.190
You'll either end up
deflated or spend your time

00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:28.050
defending your idea
instead of going for it.

00:24:28.050 --> 00:24:30.626
She kept her idea
secret for a year.

00:24:30.626 --> 00:24:32.000
She told her
friends and families

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.580
that she was working
on something,

00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:35.370
but she wouldn't tell them what.

00:24:35.370 --> 00:24:38.930
And when she finally told them
that the idea was footless

00:24:38.930 --> 00:24:41.930
pantyhose, they laughed at her.

00:24:41.930 --> 00:24:44.220
And when they were
done laughing,

00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:48.490
she heard comments like, well,
honey, if it is a good idea,

00:24:48.490 --> 00:24:51.620
then why haven't the
big guys done it?

00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:55.540
But by that point, she was
too invested to give up.

00:24:55.540 --> 00:24:57.790
And she says the
she's pretty positive

00:24:57.790 --> 00:25:00.600
that if she had told her friends
and family about Spanx early

00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:05.980
on, she would still be selling
fax machines door to door.

00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:08.990
Someone else who talks
about the importance

00:25:08.990 --> 00:25:12.770
of keeping a young idea secret,
but for different reasons,

00:25:12.770 --> 00:25:14.730
is Jeff Kinney.

00:25:14.730 --> 00:25:18.900
He is the author of the
"Diary of a Wimpy Kid"

00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:23.250
series, which is a wildly
successful series of books.

00:25:23.250 --> 00:25:28.880
There's over 115 million
of them in print right now.

00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:31.640
And there's also been
a couple movies made.

00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:35.880
And his history, that ever
since he was in college,

00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:39.280
he aspired to be a
newspaper cartoonist.

00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:42.430
But the problem was he could
not get his cartoon syndicated

00:25:42.430 --> 00:25:43.600
in a newspaper.

00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:45.450
And he tried really hard.

00:25:45.450 --> 00:25:49.660
He says, I would spend between
six and nine months putting

00:25:49.660 --> 00:25:51.490
together a submission
packet, and then

00:25:51.490 --> 00:25:53.700
send it out to all
the syndicates,

00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:57.910
only to get really tough,
terse rejection letters back.

00:25:57.910 --> 00:25:59.190
This went on for a few years.

00:25:59.190 --> 00:26:01.310
And it was very soul sucking.

00:26:01.310 --> 00:26:07.070
So what he did was he spent
eight years writing his book,

00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:08.680
"Diary of a Wimpy Kid."

00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:11.350
But he protected
himself during that time

00:26:11.350 --> 00:26:13.850
by telling very few
people about it.

00:26:13.850 --> 00:26:17.780
And he explains that when you
broadcast your intentions,

00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:19.740
you're likely to
either get embarrassed

00:26:19.740 --> 00:26:22.950
if you're unable to
deliver, or become

00:26:22.950 --> 00:26:26.380
trapped by the social
pressure to follow through.

00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:28.580
And if you keep an
idea to yourself,

00:26:28.580 --> 00:26:30.960
you can maintain
more flexibility.

00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:33.490
And that's something
that's really necessary.

00:26:33.490 --> 00:26:37.400
Being able to switch
directions when you need to

00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:40.540
is often really necessary
to produce something great.

00:26:43.790 --> 00:26:45.540
This is Anderson Cooper.

00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:49.780
And something that is not
included in his essay,

00:26:49.780 --> 00:26:53.280
but it seems like it's
something a lot of people know,

00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:56.230
is that his mother
is Gloria Vanderbilt.

00:26:56.230 --> 00:26:58.200
And he comes from the
Vanderbilt family,

00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:00.350
which is a very wealthy family.

00:27:00.350 --> 00:27:04.120
So a lot of times, people
have said things to me

00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:07.900
like oh, I'm sure he didn't
have much trouble getting

00:27:07.900 --> 00:27:11.580
to where he is, and he probably
had a lot of connections.

00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:15.330
And this is so not the case.

00:27:15.330 --> 00:27:18.770
First of all, his
essay starts like this.

00:27:18.770 --> 00:27:21.690
My father died during
heart bypass surgery

00:27:21.690 --> 00:27:23.400
when I was 10 years old.

00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:27.530
When I was 21, my 23-year-old
brother committed suicide.

00:27:27.530 --> 00:27:30.660
He jumped off the terrace of
our family's penthouse apartment

00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:33.090
as my mother pleaded
for him to stay put.

00:27:33.090 --> 00:27:36.350
I think that any time you
experience traumatic loss early

00:27:36.350 --> 00:27:39.160
on, it changes who you are
and drastically affects

00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:40.960
your view of the world.

00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:43.970
At least that was
the case with me.

00:27:43.970 --> 00:27:47.580
So he talks about the
tough emotional time

00:27:47.580 --> 00:27:49.480
he had from those experiences.

00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:53.040
But he eventually
was able to move on,

00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:55.400
and he decided that he
wanted to be a foreign news

00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:56.810
correspondent.

00:27:56.810 --> 00:27:59.940
The problem was,
despite any connections

00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:04.440
you might think he had, he
couldn't get an entry level job

00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:06.870
at any of the major networks.

00:28:06.870 --> 00:28:08.110
And he tried.

00:28:08.110 --> 00:28:11.370
But finally, a friend
from high school

00:28:11.370 --> 00:28:14.280
told him about
Channel One, which

00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:18.050
is an agency that produces
youth oriented news

00:28:18.050 --> 00:28:19.550
problems for high schools.

00:28:19.550 --> 00:28:22.910
And he was able to get a
job as a fact checker there.

00:28:22.910 --> 00:28:27.510
And he realized pretty soon
that when you work at a company,

00:28:27.510 --> 00:28:31.830
people there tend to pigeonhole
you in whatever role you're in.

00:28:31.830 --> 00:28:35.540
And sometimes, you have to
do something really drastic

00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:38.390
to change people's
perception of you.

00:28:38.390 --> 00:28:42.260
So what he did was he quit
his job as a fact checker,

00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:46.300
and he went overseas to
shoot stories by himself.

00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:49.120
And he made the stories as
interesting and dangerous

00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:53.610
as possible, then offered
to sell them to Channel One

00:28:53.610 --> 00:28:56.290
for such a low price that it
was hard for them to refuse.

00:28:56.290 --> 00:29:01.380
And that is how he launched
his career, which leads me

00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:05.920
to another big theme, which is
create your own opportunities.

00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:08.690
A lot of people in the book
say that you should not

00:29:08.690 --> 00:29:11.930
wait for someone to
recognize a talent in you

00:29:11.930 --> 00:29:14.110
and offer you something.

00:29:14.110 --> 00:29:15.950
If you want something
to happen, you

00:29:15.950 --> 00:29:17.445
have to make it happen yourself.

00:29:20.780 --> 00:29:22.310
This is Jim Koch.

00:29:22.310 --> 00:29:27.620
And he got a JD MBA
at Harvard, and then

00:29:27.620 --> 00:29:31.350
had a really high paying job
at the Boston Consulting Group.

00:29:31.350 --> 00:29:34.650
And it was the kind of job
that a lot of his peers

00:29:34.650 --> 00:29:36.500
would be very jealous of.

00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:39.520
But he was totally unhappy.

00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:43.240
And his dream was to start
his own microbrewery,

00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:47.260
but he was really worried
about risking it all

00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:49.330
to embark on a startup.

00:29:49.330 --> 00:29:53.090
And this changed when he
realized the simple thing,

00:29:53.090 --> 00:29:56.140
which is that if his
entrepreneurial venture didn't

00:29:56.140 --> 00:30:00.550
pan out, he would always be
able to rejoin the workforce

00:30:00.550 --> 00:30:03.360
and get another job that
he wasn't crazy about.

00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:06.670
But the real, while
starting his own business

00:30:06.670 --> 00:30:09.250
seemed like a risky thing
to do, the real risk

00:30:09.250 --> 00:30:11.390
was wasting years
of his life stuck

00:30:11.390 --> 00:30:13.620
in something that
appeared attractive

00:30:13.620 --> 00:30:14.950
but that he didn't enjoy.

00:30:14.950 --> 00:30:18.770
And Jim is the founder of
the Boston Beer Company

00:30:18.770 --> 00:30:22.100
that produces Sam Adams
beer, which I'm sure,

00:30:22.100 --> 00:30:25.560
everybody has had.

00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:28.530
So the biggest risk is
often not taking a risk.

00:30:28.530 --> 00:30:31.710
And this is another
big theme in the book.

00:30:31.710 --> 00:30:34.170
So many of the subjects
stressed that in order

00:30:34.170 --> 00:30:37.180
to accomplish anything, you
have to put yourself out

00:30:37.180 --> 00:30:38.880
there and take some risk.

00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:44.770
And that leads me to my next
subject, J. Craig Venter.

00:30:44.770 --> 00:30:47.590
He is a scientist, and
he was the first person

00:30:47.590 --> 00:30:50.340
to sequence the human genome.

00:30:50.340 --> 00:30:56.050
And I didn't know exactly what
this meant before I researched

00:30:56.050 --> 00:30:58.650
him to go interview
him, so I'm just

00:30:58.650 --> 00:31:00.220
going to spell it out for you.

00:31:00.220 --> 00:31:03.260
And sequencing the
human genome basically

00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:06.650
means reading a human's DNA.

00:31:06.650 --> 00:31:09.880
And the medical possibilities
that this information

00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:11.550
can lead to are endless.

00:31:11.550 --> 00:31:15.210
For example, if you know
what genes a person has,

00:31:15.210 --> 00:31:20.350
you know how likely they are
to develop various diseases.

00:31:20.350 --> 00:31:24.580
So you might think that a
genius scientist like this

00:31:24.580 --> 00:31:28.610
would have done well in
school, but not this one.

00:31:28.610 --> 00:31:32.020
He spent most of
his career sitting

00:31:32.020 --> 00:31:36.650
in the back of the classroom
throwing spit balls

00:31:36.650 --> 00:31:40.650
at the professors, the
teachers, with his friend,

00:31:40.650 --> 00:31:43.130
who is an actual member
of Hell's Angels.

00:31:43.130 --> 00:31:46.250
He said in seventh
grade, his best friend

00:31:46.250 --> 00:31:49.540
had been flunked so many
times that he was old enough

00:31:49.540 --> 00:31:52.460
to be a Hell's Angel.

00:31:52.460 --> 00:31:58.070
And then Craig almost
flunked out of school.

00:31:58.070 --> 00:32:00.860
He actually slid by on a D-.

00:32:00.860 --> 00:32:03.400
They had him write
one extra paper.

00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:04.984
And he says it
was to get him out

00:32:04.984 --> 00:32:06.650
of there, because he
was sure they don't

00:32:06.650 --> 00:32:08.610
want to see his face anymore.

00:32:08.610 --> 00:32:12.510
So after school,
similar to David Boies,

00:32:12.510 --> 00:32:14.180
he did not want
to go to college.

00:32:14.180 --> 00:32:16.510
He wanted to surf, and
that's what he did.

00:32:16.510 --> 00:32:20.610
He moved to Southern California
and surfed during the day,

00:32:20.610 --> 00:32:26.290
and he got jobs to make money
like putting price tags on toys

00:32:26.290 --> 00:32:30.910
at Sears and being a baggage
handler at the airport.

00:32:30.910 --> 00:32:36.570
But the draft eventually got
in the way of this lifestyle.

00:32:36.570 --> 00:32:39.610
And next thing you know,
he was sent off to Vietnam.

00:32:39.610 --> 00:32:43.340
And he joined the
Medical Corpsman school.

00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:46.230
And when he got there,
he was completely

00:32:46.230 --> 00:32:48.790
traumatized by what he saw.

00:32:48.790 --> 00:32:53.750
He saw hundreds to thousands
of people his own age

00:32:53.750 --> 00:32:57.190
dying every day, and he
didn't believe in what

00:32:57.190 --> 00:32:59.480
America was doing there.

00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:02.910
And he found this situation
to be overwhelming,

00:33:02.910 --> 00:33:07.730
and he, after a few months,
decided to commit suicide.

00:33:07.730 --> 00:33:10.360
So I'll read you
his description.

00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:13.270
He said, I went to the
beach, got in the water,

00:33:13.270 --> 00:33:15.270
and started swimming out to sea.

00:33:15.270 --> 00:33:17.870
My plan was to keep going
until I was exhausted,

00:33:17.870 --> 00:33:21.420
then sink into the dark
waters in oblivion.

00:33:21.420 --> 00:33:23.680
More than a mile out,
I saw a venomous sea

00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:25.740
snake surface to breathe.

00:33:25.740 --> 00:33:28.380
I began to have doubts
about what I was doing,

00:33:28.380 --> 00:33:31.950
but I continued on until
I encountered a shark.

00:33:31.950 --> 00:33:34.590
I was instantaneously
consumed with fear.

00:33:34.590 --> 00:33:38.050
All thoughts of dying departed,
and I realized that I very much

00:33:38.050 --> 00:33:39.150
wanted to live.

00:33:39.150 --> 00:33:42.510
I wanted to live more than
I ever had in my previous 21

00:33:42.510 --> 00:33:43.890
years of my life.

00:33:43.890 --> 00:33:47.020
I turned around, and
driven by sheer adrenalin,

00:33:47.020 --> 00:33:49.420
swam for the shore
in a state of panic.

00:33:49.420 --> 00:33:52.330
Once I made it to safety,
I never looked back.

00:33:52.330 --> 00:33:54.290
Something inside me had changed.

00:33:54.290 --> 00:33:56.440
I wanted my life
to mean something.

00:33:56.440 --> 00:33:58.540
I wanted to make a
difference in the world.

00:33:58.540 --> 00:34:00.190
I wanted to do
something to make up

00:34:00.190 --> 00:34:03.540
for everything I saw in
Vietnam and honor those who

00:34:03.540 --> 00:34:06.080
were already beyond my help.

00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:08.929
So at first, Craig
thought that he

00:34:08.929 --> 00:34:11.710
would become a doctor in
a third world country.

00:34:11.710 --> 00:34:14.350
But then, he realized
eventually that he

00:34:14.350 --> 00:34:17.179
could make the biggest
impact on the world

00:34:17.179 --> 00:34:19.699
if he was a scientist.

00:34:19.699 --> 00:34:24.219
And basically, he ended up
rising to the top of his field

00:34:24.219 --> 00:34:26.380
by going out on
professional limbs

00:34:26.380 --> 00:34:29.940
that very few people would.

00:34:29.940 --> 00:34:34.570
He had a highly coveted
job with the government,

00:34:34.570 --> 00:34:36.580
trying to sequence
the human genome.

00:34:36.580 --> 00:34:40.120
But he thought that
he had a better

00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:42.219
idea for a method
that would work

00:34:42.219 --> 00:34:44.380
more efficiently and quicker.

00:34:44.380 --> 00:34:46.190
And they weren't
up for trying it,

00:34:46.190 --> 00:34:51.260
so he left his government job,
and he started his own company.

00:34:51.260 --> 00:34:54.360
And it was based on a theory
that most of his peers

00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:56.010
thought would not work.

00:34:56.010 --> 00:34:59.760
And when he started
his own company,

00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:03.150
his peers viciously
attacked him,

00:35:03.150 --> 00:35:06.240
because his new
method was a threat

00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:09.460
to their way of doing things.

00:35:09.460 --> 00:35:13.810
But Craig explains that his
time serving in Vietnam really

00:35:13.810 --> 00:35:15.590
helped him put things
in perspective.

00:35:15.590 --> 00:35:19.790
He says that out there, he had
to worry about risking his life

00:35:19.790 --> 00:35:21.700
multiple times a day.

00:35:21.700 --> 00:35:23.840
But being back in the
comfort of America,

00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:25.700
with his life
relatively protected,

00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:28.240
career risks seemed
pretty trivial.

00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:30.690
And in the end, he was right.

00:35:30.690 --> 00:35:31.700
His method works.

00:35:31.700 --> 00:35:34.170
And it's now the
method that is used

00:35:34.170 --> 00:35:36.170
by all of his early critics.

00:35:39.390 --> 00:35:41.950
So another theme in the
book that this demonstrates

00:35:41.950 --> 00:35:45.410
is that you have to question
everything, but then

00:35:45.410 --> 00:35:50.190
expect resistance to new
ideas and approaches.

00:35:50.190 --> 00:35:53.600
My subjects say that
challenging conventional wisdom

00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:56.370
and questioning
authority is essential

00:35:56.370 --> 00:35:59.550
for creative
progress, and that you

00:35:59.550 --> 00:36:02.530
have to remember that just
because something has been

00:36:02.530 --> 00:36:05.800
done one way for
years, doesn't mean

00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:07.400
that another way won't work.

00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:10.060
And it doesn't mean that
that's the best way.

00:36:10.060 --> 00:36:13.900
But watch out, because
people don't like change.

00:36:13.900 --> 00:36:15.990
Sometimes it's a
threat to people's way

00:36:15.990 --> 00:36:18.325
of doing something, so you're
going to get resistance.

00:36:21.010 --> 00:36:24.540
This is Frank
Gehry, an architect.

00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:27.600
And he says that he has
always looked at things

00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:30.250
and thought, how do we
have to do it that way?

00:36:30.250 --> 00:36:32.060
Can't it be done another way?

00:36:32.060 --> 00:36:33.910
And he says that
that trait has been

00:36:33.910 --> 00:36:37.720
really critical to his work.

00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:41.890
But the things he
designed don't really

00:36:41.890 --> 00:36:46.860
conform to any particular
architectural philosophy.

00:36:46.860 --> 00:36:50.490
And he is now called one of
the most important architects

00:36:50.490 --> 00:36:51.500
of our age.

00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:54.082
I'm just going to show
you this example of one

00:36:54.082 --> 00:36:54.790
of his buildings.

00:36:54.790 --> 00:37:00.470
This is the Walt Disney
Concert Hall in Los Angeles.

00:37:00.470 --> 00:37:05.380
But when Frank was in
architecture school,

00:37:05.380 --> 00:37:08.430
in his second year, a professor
called him into his office,

00:37:08.430 --> 00:37:10.470
and sat him down
and said, Frank,

00:37:10.470 --> 00:37:12.490
you are never going to
make it in this field.

00:37:12.490 --> 00:37:14.180
You should get out now.

00:37:14.180 --> 00:37:15.910
You're wasting a lot of time.

00:37:15.910 --> 00:37:19.580
And then even when he
started his own practice,

00:37:19.580 --> 00:37:22.070
many of his colleagues
were dismissive of him

00:37:22.070 --> 00:37:24.110
and made fun of his work.

00:37:24.110 --> 00:37:31.270
But like Craig Venter, they've
turned into supporters.

00:37:34.620 --> 00:37:37.130
This is Muhammad Yunus.

00:37:37.130 --> 00:37:41.470
He grew up in Bangladesh,
and he became a professor.

00:37:41.470 --> 00:37:45.440
And back then, the country
was in a terrible state.

00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:48.660
There were destitute people
roaming the streets starving,

00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:52.660
and Muhammad Yunus wanted
to do something to help.

00:37:52.660 --> 00:37:55.910
So he did something unheard of.

00:37:55.910 --> 00:38:00.580
He knew that if he
gave these poor people

00:38:00.580 --> 00:38:03.510
just a little bit of
money, it could drastically

00:38:03.510 --> 00:38:05.030
change their life.

00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:08.340
So he wanted to
start a bank that

00:38:08.340 --> 00:38:14.050
lent to the poorest of the poor
in small amounts, and to women.

00:38:14.050 --> 00:38:15.250
And this was unheard of.

00:38:15.250 --> 00:38:18.480
He was told that his
idea was foolish,

00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:19.660
that it would never work.

00:38:19.660 --> 00:38:22.670
He was attacked.

00:38:22.670 --> 00:38:26.400
But he founded the
Grameen Bank anyway,

00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:29.260
and he won a Nobel
Prize for his work.

00:38:29.260 --> 00:38:33.790
And he explains, if you observe
something that bothers you,

00:38:33.790 --> 00:38:36.500
make your own action
plan to fix it.

00:38:36.500 --> 00:38:39.710
There are many things that have
been designed in the wrong way.

00:38:39.710 --> 00:38:42.880
Don't think that other
people know more than you.

00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:45.965
Your theory may be right, and
you can become the new expert.

00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:51.980
This is Ian Schrager.

00:38:51.980 --> 00:38:55.890
He came into the limelight
when he and his partner, Steve

00:38:55.890 --> 00:39:00.110
Rubell, opened the legendary
nightclub, Studio 54,

00:39:00.110 --> 00:39:01.970
in New York.

00:39:01.970 --> 00:39:08.520
It became wildly successful, and
they became wildly intoxicated

00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:10.450
with their success.

00:39:10.450 --> 00:39:16.230
And they started thinking that
the rules didn't apply to them.

00:39:16.230 --> 00:39:22.130
They didn't pay income
taxes, and they got caught.

00:39:22.130 --> 00:39:27.000
And they got sent to
prison for 13 months.

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:28.190
He lost everything.

00:39:28.190 --> 00:39:33.120
And when he got out of prison,
he was almost $2 million

00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:34.960
in debt.

00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:38.940
But eventually, and he
describes how in his essay,

00:39:38.940 --> 00:39:42.150
he was able to get
back on his feet

00:39:42.150 --> 00:39:47.160
and reinvent himself as a
hotelier and a real estate

00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:47.820
investor.

00:39:47.820 --> 00:39:50.490
And in a really big
way, he's responsible

00:39:50.490 --> 00:39:54.690
for the whole boutique
hotel revolution.

00:39:54.690 --> 00:39:58.150
But this whole ordeal
set him back 10 years.

00:39:58.150 --> 00:40:01.170
So that's how long
it took for him

00:40:01.170 --> 00:40:07.610
to get back from to where he
was before he went to prison.

00:40:07.610 --> 00:40:11.850
He calls himself proof that
the prison system works,

00:40:11.850 --> 00:40:16.140
and he also says there's
very little in life

00:40:16.140 --> 00:40:20.480
that you can't recover
from with hard work.

00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:23.350
But out of all of
my subjects, I think

00:40:23.350 --> 00:40:26.500
he sums up a major theme
in the book the best.

00:40:26.500 --> 00:40:29.780
And he says in the
end, there's so little

00:40:29.780 --> 00:40:31.350
that separates people.

00:40:31.350 --> 00:40:33.520
Those who want success
the most and are

00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:37.620
relentless about pursuing
it are the ones who get it.

00:40:37.620 --> 00:40:45.460
And I'm going to end with
one last quote from me.

00:40:45.460 --> 00:40:48.040
What could this mean?

00:40:48.040 --> 00:40:52.340
A lot of people have asked me
what the most common thread

00:40:52.340 --> 00:40:55.580
between my subjects is.

00:40:55.580 --> 00:40:59.910
And I thought, it's such
a diverse group of people.

00:40:59.910 --> 00:41:04.300
But they're all moles from
that game, Whac-A-Mole.

00:41:04.300 --> 00:41:06.960
If you don't know what
I'm talking about,

00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:08.780
this is the game
I'm talking about.

00:41:08.780 --> 00:41:11.990
You see it in carnivals
where the little mole

00:41:11.990 --> 00:41:16.550
pops its head up, and you whack
it, and whack it, and whack it.

00:41:16.550 --> 00:41:22.850
Well, it seems like life whacks
us all over the head from time

00:41:22.850 --> 00:41:23.400
to time.

00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:26.590
It could be in big
ways, and in small ways,

00:41:26.590 --> 00:41:29.550
and in ways that have
to do with our career,

00:41:29.550 --> 00:41:31.330
or our personal life.

00:41:31.330 --> 00:41:36.160
And the people in my book
are all where they are today

00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:40.380
because even after getting
whacked multiple times,

00:41:40.380 --> 00:41:44.760
they also found a way to
pop their heads back up out

00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:45.630
of the hole.

00:41:45.630 --> 00:41:47.690
They might have gone
down in the hole

00:41:47.690 --> 00:41:50.100
for a little bit,
licked their wounds,

00:41:50.100 --> 00:41:52.730
felt sorry for themselves.

00:41:52.730 --> 00:41:54.560
They all learned
from their mistakes.

00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:58.660
But in the end,
they popped back up.

00:41:58.660 --> 00:42:02.300
And I think that's what you
have to do in this world,

00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:06.590
because as David Boies
says, there inevitably

00:42:06.590 --> 00:42:08.490
are going to be ups and downs.

00:42:08.490 --> 00:42:14.090
So the next time any of
you get a little whack,

00:42:14.090 --> 00:42:16.810
think of the people
in getting there,

00:42:16.810 --> 00:42:20.050
remember Whac-A-Mole,
and then figure out

00:42:20.050 --> 00:42:25.190
a way to get yourself out of
whatever hole you might be in.

00:42:25.190 --> 00:42:25.931
Done.

00:42:25.931 --> 00:42:29.228
[APPLAUSE]

00:42:30.641 --> 00:42:32.620
MALE SPEAKER: So we're
open for questions now.

00:42:32.620 --> 00:42:35.005
Just raise your hand,
and I'll stop by.

00:42:35.005 --> 00:42:36.380
AUDIENCE: I was
just curious, how

00:42:36.380 --> 00:42:38.450
did you get all
these people to agree

00:42:38.450 --> 00:42:40.960
to be a part of your book?

00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:43.385
GILLIAN ZOE SEGAL:
Well, that was hard.

00:42:43.385 --> 00:42:48.370
It took me over
five years to do.

00:42:48.370 --> 00:42:55.270
And basically, I would try
every angle that I could.

00:42:55.270 --> 00:42:59.360
I had to be very
politely persistent,

00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:02.780
and not take no for an answer.

00:43:02.780 --> 00:43:05.610
One thing that's
interesting is a friend

00:43:05.610 --> 00:43:08.860
of mine, who has a
saying for everything,

00:43:08.860 --> 00:43:12.740
you know those kind of
people, he said, don't ever

00:43:12.740 --> 00:43:16.160
take a no from someone
who can't give you a yes.

00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:19.840
And what that means is if
you call someone's publicist

00:43:19.840 --> 00:43:24.920
and they say, no,
try another door.

00:43:24.920 --> 00:43:26.950
If the front door's locked,
go in the back door.

00:43:26.950 --> 00:43:29.430
If the back door's locked,
try to climb in a window.

00:43:29.430 --> 00:43:33.430
So almost everybody
in my book, I

00:43:33.430 --> 00:43:37.280
would say everyone in my
book ignored me for a while.

00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:39.960
Then most of them
rejected me for a while.

00:43:39.960 --> 00:43:44.520
And then when I
climbed in the window,

00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:46.480
they sometimes said yes.

00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:48.670
But there's a long list
of people who didn't.

00:43:52.347 --> 00:43:53.930
AUDIENCE: So what
was your inspiration

00:43:53.930 --> 00:43:55.013
for putting this together?

00:43:55.013 --> 00:43:57.130
Why did you want to do this?

00:43:57.130 --> 00:44:00.880
GILLIAN ZOE SEGAL: Partly,
I think when I started it,

00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:03.850
I thought, people need
to hear these stories.

00:44:03.850 --> 00:44:06.690
And like I said in the
beginning of the talk,

00:44:06.690 --> 00:44:12.750
it's such a great way
to persevere and to get

00:44:12.750 --> 00:44:15.060
inspiration from these.

00:44:15.060 --> 00:44:20.370
And then also, I realized
that it was a need that I had.

00:44:20.370 --> 00:44:23.220
I wanted role
models and mentors.

00:44:23.220 --> 00:44:28.090
And so you pursue something
that you're passionate about.

00:44:28.090 --> 00:44:30.770
So it's something I
wanted for myself,

00:44:30.770 --> 00:44:32.950
and I also thought that
other people would want it.

00:44:35.690 --> 00:44:39.320
AUDIENCE: So I have a question.

00:44:39.320 --> 00:44:44.324
At the risk of seeming
provocative, just humor me.

00:44:44.324 --> 00:44:45.240
GILLIAN ZOE SEGAL: OK.

00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:50.180
AUDIENCE: So there's
several names here,

00:44:50.180 --> 00:44:52.400
and they're remarkable people.

00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:56.220
But I'm just wondering,
for every one of these,

00:44:56.220 --> 00:45:00.430
there might have been 1,000
other guys who are sticking

00:45:00.430 --> 00:45:04.860
stickers on toys, whose lives
did not take them to Vietnam,

00:45:04.860 --> 00:45:09.000
for example, and who've
just led lives which

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:13.370
are not recorded in history
as glamorously as some

00:45:13.370 --> 00:45:14.790
of these names.

00:45:14.790 --> 00:45:20.260
So what role do you think luck,
chance, and circumstance play,

00:45:20.260 --> 00:45:27.150
and the narrative fallacy
playing in all of this?

00:45:27.150 --> 00:45:31.970
GILLIAN ZOE SEGAL: I think that
luck plays a chance in things.

00:45:31.970 --> 00:45:38.260
But I think Mayor Bloomberg,
Michael Bloomberg,

00:45:38.260 --> 00:45:43.340
in his speech said, the harder
you work, the luckier you get.

00:45:43.340 --> 00:45:47.250
So you're not going
to get lucky sitting

00:45:47.250 --> 00:45:49.460
on your couch watching TV.

00:45:49.460 --> 00:45:55.490
But if you're out there,
if you're going for it,

00:45:55.490 --> 00:45:57.980
you have no way better
chance of getting lucky.

00:45:57.980 --> 00:46:02.887
So I don't think
luck is pure luck.

00:46:02.887 --> 00:46:04.470
AUDIENCE: I just
have a quick question

00:46:04.470 --> 00:46:07.170
as to your choice
for the medium.

00:46:07.170 --> 00:46:11.440
I know there's a lot of
talk about like blogs,

00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:14.400
or the internet being a
medium for these sorts

00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:19.540
of personal narratives, and I
was wondering why and how you

00:46:19.540 --> 00:46:24.870
choose to present
this in a book format

00:46:24.870 --> 00:46:29.540
as opposed to a blog
or an internet--

00:46:29.540 --> 00:46:33.060
GILLIAN ZOE SEGAL: Well,
I think I could do both.

00:46:33.060 --> 00:46:38.860
So I like a book,
because to me, when

00:46:38.860 --> 00:46:43.360
I read something on a blog
it evaporates into midair.

00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:46.260
But when you have a
book, it's something

00:46:46.260 --> 00:46:50.560
that you have that's physical,
that you can pass on.

00:46:50.560 --> 00:46:52.580
You could give it to
someone in a way that you

00:46:52.580 --> 00:46:55.740
can't with a blog.

00:46:55.740 --> 00:46:59.010
So I think this makes
like a great gift,

00:46:59.010 --> 00:47:03.650
and there's something about
having something physical.

00:47:03.650 --> 00:47:06.340
Like I love to
give it to people I

00:47:06.340 --> 00:47:13.670
care about in a way that
things that are in the cloud,

00:47:13.670 --> 00:47:15.590
you can't do it like that.

00:47:18.254 --> 00:47:19.920
MALE SPEAKER: Thank
you so much Gillian.

00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:21.120
This was fantastic.

00:47:21.120 --> 00:47:24.170
[APPLAUSE]
