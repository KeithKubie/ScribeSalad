WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.820
Are we about to do? Thoughts district. Yes, we are. Okay. Three, two, one. Hey,

2
00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:06.910
I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich, Radiolab.

3
00:00:06.911 --> 00:00:11.060
And today we're talking about well change. Really what, what looks like change.

4
00:00:11.061 --> 00:00:14.100
So you remember back to the baboons where we started this program? Yeah.

5
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.880
The question we were asking then was, will those baboons,

6
00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.450
if they do enough generations, will they create a new culture? Let's stick.

7
00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.480
Will it stay? That's hope. That's hope, but we don't know. No.

8
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.250
And the town that chooses a mayor,

9
00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.760
is that town expanding the sense of possibility or is it something,

10
00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:32.660
a little blip. Yeah, exactly. But now let's get really serious.

11
00:00:32.661 --> 00:00:37.661
There are indeed changes that do stick and we're going to examine a rather

12
00:00:37.941 --> 00:00:41.980
startling example of that right now. Yeah. Um, but to do that,

13
00:00:41.981 --> 00:00:45.310
we need an evolutionary biologist and we found one at Duke University.

14
00:00:45.311 --> 00:00:47.980
You guys talk to each other now? Yeah. Hello? Hello. Who's this?

15
00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:49.750
That's Brian Hare. Fantastic.

16
00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.660
And the first thing Brian here did was tell me about another guy,

17
00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:53.920
Dimitri [inaudible].

18
00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.340
Dimitri Dimitri [inaudible] was a very famous geneticist in Russia. He was,

19
00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.440
uh, alive during World War II and doing a genetics work. But after World War II,

20
00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:09.630
uh, he was a little spot of Trump. Wow. What'd he do? Well,

21
00:01:09.631 --> 00:01:13.500
because he was a real Darwinian, he believed in evolution and genetics.

22
00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.240
But thinking about evolution, like a Darwinian evolution is,

23
00:01:17.241 --> 00:01:20.570
does that was not popular in Stallings?

24
00:01:20.571 --> 00:01:23.990
Russia is popular the word or was that a, it was not a death sentence.

25
00:01:23.991 --> 00:01:24.990
It was a death sentence.

26
00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.320
So the writing was on the wall and he knew that he should probably take the

27
00:01:30.321 --> 00:01:35.150
Trans Siberian railroad from Moscow quickly, uh, quickly.

28
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.280
And he went to Novas a beers. And the way that Dmitri Bill,

29
00:01:40.281 --> 00:01:44.540
I have decided to hide his continued interest in studying Darwinian evolution

30
00:01:44.541 --> 00:01:49.220
was he would begin a Fox farm where he would make for coats.

31
00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.470
So what is Mr BLF actually doing?

32
00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:56.660
What Dr Belisle was actually interested in was to understand how does

33
00:01:56.721 --> 00:02:01.070
domestication happen? That's his question.

34
00:02:01.071 --> 00:02:01.980
That's a dumb question. No,

35
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
it's not a dumb question at all because you bring that note.

36
00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:10.010
If think about a wild animal, it is impulsive, it is aggressive,

37
00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.200
it gravel. What is it? A Wolf where you're playing?

38
00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.080
That's a wolf that I've got there in the backyard.

39
00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.930
Now this is a domesticated version.

40
00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.710
The nature of the animal has completely changed here.

41
00:02:24.711 --> 00:02:27.140
And if you want to learn something about the nature of a creature,

42
00:02:27.141 --> 00:02:30.800
how it can change. Domesticated animals are a wonderful place to start.

43
00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.890
So belief he decided,

44
00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.040
why don't I just experimentally domesticate some animals?

45
00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.420
And his cover was that he was going to make better for coats.

46
00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.880
When was this, by the way? 1959 okay,

47
00:02:43.881 --> 00:02:47.450
so Sputnik was up Russians for feeling good and he was making fur coats,

48
00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:52.040
so to speak, so to speak. Began one of the most exciting experiments in biology.

49
00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:53.910
So here's what Dimitri Herbalife does.

50
00:02:53.911 --> 00:02:55.740
He goes to a bunch of fuck's farmers and he said, look,

51
00:02:55.741 --> 00:02:58.930
I want to buy a bunch of foxes. And he says, well,

52
00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.280
all I gotta do is take this group of foxes and break them into two groups and

53
00:03:03.281 --> 00:03:07.270
one group. I'm not going to change them in any way. So it's like a control line.

54
00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.100
So one group is just normal fox normal,

55
00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:14.340
but the other line I'm going to decide who is going to be allowed to breed and

56
00:03:14.411 --> 00:03:16.990
who is unfortunately going to be a fur coat.

57
00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:22.580
So some of the faxes get to have puppy foxes of their own and some foxes become

58
00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:29.350
news. So what he did in the test was marvelously simple. You would go,

59
00:03:29.351 --> 00:03:34.351
or what if this assistance would approach in cage where the Fox was kept a baby

60
00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:35.980
fall, sort of a juvenile fox.

61
00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.120
The experimenter would stand say a foot away and would just try to touch the

62
00:03:40.121 --> 00:03:43.510
Fox. I hated the Fox high run fox run.

63
00:03:43.511 --> 00:03:48.511
But if the Fox would make this kind of sound and sort of cower in the corner,

64
00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:52.840
it's like most Fox would do. What is that? What's a sound?

65
00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.710
That is the sound the Fox meets when it's frightening. Really? Yes.

66
00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.980
So what happens if it makes that sound? Well,

67
00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:03.940
they did not breed that Fox in the next generation or to put it another way,

68
00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:09.040
they kill him. That pretty much, yes, that's just wrong.

69
00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:13.440
But now every so often, like maybe one out of every 20 foxes,

70
00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:17.500
there would be a Fox that would not run back, would not,

71
00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:19.450
so it wasn't afraid then.

72
00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:24.400
Then they would choose that Fox to breed in the next generation. Yay.

73
00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.090
And they did this over and over again. Generation after generation,

74
00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.690
they would breed the nice foxes together. Get rid of the bad fox.

75
00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:37.360
Breed the next set. Get rid of the bad foxes breed. The next set. Next set.

76
00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.140
Next set. Next set. Next second guy. Right.

77
00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:43.830
What happened in the end will eventually eat.

78
00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.810
They had foxes that were attracted to humans. Now Jed,

79
00:04:46.811 --> 00:04:51.100
how long do you think it would take to get foxes from being wild,

80
00:04:51.101 --> 00:04:55.780
ferocious animals to being animals who would lick your face after this?

81
00:04:55.781 --> 00:04:58.690
Kind of like an exterminating reading. Yes,

82
00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:02.020
I've taken breeding techniques a long, long time.

83
00:05:02.021 --> 00:05:05.890
I mean now like how many years? How many years? How many years? Well,

84
00:05:05.891 --> 00:05:09.360
it took wolves like thousands of years to become dogs. Domino.

85
00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.840
I mean a long time. Well, here's this. Here's the thing. 10 years is the answer.

86
00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.310
10 years now. Shut up. Don't tell me to shut up.

87
00:05:18.311 --> 00:05:22.630
I'm telling you it's 10 years. But now here's the crazy thing.

88
00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:27.660
What was exciting and surprising was that these same foxes,

89
00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:33.190
they actually show a whole suite of changes that he did not select for on

90
00:05:33.191 --> 00:05:37.240
purpose. Like what do you mean physical changes? These foxes,

91
00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:41.170
as they became more gentle for some unaccountable reason,

92
00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:45.130
their ears instead of pointing straight up, flipped over. That's right.

93
00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.790
It was a big accident that they now have floppy ears.

94
00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:52.090
The tales on a Fox, which in a wild fucks, they're straight.

95
00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:55.240
Now they have curly tails.

96
00:05:55.660 --> 00:06:00.660
They have multicolored that are no longer just grave tips of their new paws,

97
00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:02.373
loose color.

98
00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:07.010
The teeth gets smaller and their bones became very thin.

99
00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:08.960
Their bones got thinner. Yes, yes.

100
00:06:08.961 --> 00:06:13.190
So what happens to the skull and the face is it actually becomes more feminine.

101
00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:17.990
The whole animal becomes more delicate than more puppy. Like, wow,

102
00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:24.270
I did sir. I don't know what to make of that. Yep. And it's not over.

103
00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:27.060
This experiment has been going on. It's now been 50 years,

104
00:06:27.061 --> 00:06:31.720
45,000 foxes later, 45,000 and Brian, by the way,

105
00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:34.560
he who has read about this is that I got to see this for myself.

106
00:06:34.561 --> 00:06:38.800
So he went to the Novosibirsk just to check. I did.

107
00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:41.680
I took the Trans Siberian Railroad, which you know,

108
00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:46.450
two days of looking at green grass and there's like one species of tree and I

109
00:06:46.451 --> 00:06:49.420
think there was a butterfly that was kind of pretty, I was at birch trees.

110
00:06:49.421 --> 00:06:50.930
You're looking at British tree than another bridge tree,

111
00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:55.330
then another bridge street and pretty much you got it. You got it, you got it,

112
00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:59.500
you got it. So I show up and they had thousands of foxes,

113
00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:01.540
giant buildings that are probably, you know,

114
00:07:01.541 --> 00:07:06.541
as long as a football field full of just rows and rows of foxes.

115
00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:10.390
And when you see them, they actually wag their tail.

116
00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:12.100
They whine like a puppy dog.

117
00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:16.090
They're cute and cuddly and they love people and they don't bite.

118
00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:19.840
So it sounds perfect except for the one thing I forgot to tell you is that when

119
00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:21.670
they're yapping and excited to see you,

120
00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:25.840
they cannot help but pee for Joel as I do.

121
00:07:25.841 --> 00:07:27.310
Whenever I see you.

122
00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:30.610
The thing though is it makes sense to me that they're getting nicer because

123
00:07:30.611 --> 00:07:31.910
they're breeding them to get nicer.

124
00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:35.020
But why is all this other stuff happening with their, to their bodies?

125
00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:37.990
What's going on? Well, you know, yeah,

126
00:07:37.991 --> 00:07:40.090
this is the unsatisfactory answer to that problem.

127
00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:45.400
Nobody really knows why, but okay, I'm rolling on my end.

128
00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:46.860
This is to come some fit. Sure.

129
00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:51.820
Here's a synchronize sync and evolutionary biologist at the University of St

130
00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:54.640
Andrews in Scotland. And he has a notion,

131
00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:57.610
my hypothesis for what's going on here, and this is just a hypothesis.

132
00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:01.240
Here's what he told me, cause you gotta go back to when the Fox is a very,

133
00:08:01.241 --> 00:08:05.530
very little itty bitty thing. An embryo inside its mother's womb, very, very,

134
00:08:05.531 --> 00:08:06.520
very early embryo,

135
00:08:06.521 --> 00:08:10.120
like two months old to become a Fox that can survive in the world.

136
00:08:10.121 --> 00:08:14.410
This little embryo needs to grow strong teeth. Yep. It has to grow for need.

137
00:08:14.411 --> 00:08:17.440
The for cats are having bone strong bone. The bone needs to grow,

138
00:08:17.441 --> 00:08:21.910
blends and looks to grow hormones and all of these things that you need as an

139
00:08:21.911 --> 00:08:22.600
adult Fox,

140
00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:27.040
all of them come from the same founder population of cells in an embryo. Oh Wow.

141
00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:30.900
I didn't know that. Yeah. They called neural crest Xero crest cells.

142
00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:34.750
When the Fox grows in these cells, they're doing these epic migrations.

143
00:08:34.751 --> 00:08:36.490
These guys are like pioneers that are,

144
00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:39.940
that are moving throughout the body and blazing these trails all over the place.

145
00:08:40.810 --> 00:08:42.220
Some of them go out into the skin.

146
00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:45.280
Some of them go up into the cartilage of the Fox's ears.

147
00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:48.850
Some of them go into the job and they form all these different tissues.

148
00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:52.390
Tail, big parts of the nervous system,

149
00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:57.060
major parts of the brain and the adrenal glands.

150
00:08:57.630 --> 00:09:00.420
What's the adrenal gland? Well, that's the most important one for our purposes.

151
00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:04.950
The adrenal gland pumps out when to be afraid.

152
00:09:05.270 --> 00:09:09.030
Ah, real again. Say, when am I running with went away? That makes the fox go.

153
00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:13.380
Yeah, whatever that sounded like. It's the one that makes that sound.

154
00:09:13.381 --> 00:09:16.320
So when you're breeding fear out of an animal,

155
00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:21.960
<v 2>maybe what you're doing is you're slowing down</v>

156
00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:28.020
the migrations of these cells. They don't deliver the fear,

157
00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:30.810
and if they don't deliver all the other things that they usually do,

158
00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:34.380
what you're focusing on, what you as the experiment are doing is saying,

159
00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:38.190
I want the guys who's adrenal gland stone mature quickly that might have the

160
00:09:38.191 --> 00:09:40.380
function of making the animal more tame,

161
00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:44.610
but what you're doing as a byproduct of that is selecting for guys who don't get

162
00:09:44.611 --> 00:09:47.790
as many of the cells into their ears and don't get as many of those cells into

163
00:09:47.791 --> 00:09:51.600
their skin and don't get as many of those cells into their teeth.

164
00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:54.530
So if you get some of the cells,

165
00:09:54.890 --> 00:09:58.710
<v 0>me to make your ears firm in straight, but not quite enough,</v>

166
00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:01.290
then your ear will go up to a certain point.

167
00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:03.660
It's just the sales aren't going to complete the deal.

168
00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:07.390
The rest of your ear flaps over. Really? Yeah.

169
00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:12.410
You haven't come because dogs have a little floppy because the cells have been

170
00:10:12.601 --> 00:10:16.450
slowed down to the point where they don't finish. The job they were there,

171
00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:19.010
they are literally arrested. Bingo.

172
00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:22.760
The argument is that actually when you select against aggression in animals,

173
00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.600
you're changing the timing and the rate of development such that the

174
00:10:26.601 --> 00:10:29.950
experimental foxes are actually frozen as juveniles.

175
00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:33.230
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

176
00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:34.940
<v 0>they actually never really grow up</v>

177
00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:38.010
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

178
00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:40.080
<v 2>so then to domesticate a file</v>

179
00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:42.390
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

180
00:10:42.390 --> 00:10:44.730
<v 0>just like to domesticate a wolf into a dog.</v>

181
00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:47.910
What you're doing is you're making them permanent puppies.

182
00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:50.610
It's a Peter pan kind of thing. They just [inaudible]

183
00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.420
so if we wanted to apply this to,

184
00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:57.870
to us [inaudible] and we wanted to say breed a gentler,

185
00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:02.850
sleeker human being, yeah. We should just kill the football players.

186
00:11:02.851 --> 00:11:04.910
Is that the idea where he would kill the football?

187
00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:07.170
You don't have something against football player? No, actually I like football,

188
00:11:07.171 --> 00:11:10.590
but I mean at d like with the foxes, you just eliminate the meanings. Oh,

189
00:11:10.591 --> 00:11:12.660
the meat, yes. With the same thing happened to us.

190
00:11:12.690 --> 00:11:16.470
That's where it gets really interesting. You remember the, the professor,

191
00:11:16.471 --> 00:11:20.600
we interviewed him a few hours back. A Richard Wrangham vividly. Well.

192
00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:24.740
Um, when we think about humans, obviously we're getting, you know,

193
00:11:24.741 --> 00:11:28.730
just super speculative, but he says, if you choose to go back,

194
00:11:28.731 --> 00:11:32.030
if we go back just 30,000, 50,000 years,

195
00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:34.210
can you look at the collection of skulls,

196
00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:37.040
the early versions of us from way back then?

197
00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:40.970
You see some interesting fucks like changes. Well,

198
00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:44.120
if you look at domesticated animals,

199
00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:48.470
they have smaller teeth than the wild ancestors.

200
00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:53.620
And in humans we've been getting smaller teeth over the last few tens of of

201
00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:54.340
years. Josh,

202
00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:58.210
<v 3>like the Fox, we've been getting more grass aisle bones. That means to say that,</v>

203
00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:02.800
um, for a particular length of limb bone, it becomes a little bit narrower.

204
00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:09.120
So it is tempting to think that the same kind of process has been going on in

205
00:12:10.481 --> 00:12:13.060
humans as it's been going on in domesticated animals,

206
00:12:13.061 --> 00:12:17.440
which is that there has been natural selection in favor of a kinder,

207
00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:22.180
gentler human [inaudible] Secondo who's doing the selecting in the case of the

208
00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:23.800
foxes,

209
00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:28.180
Mr BLF shuck you if you were too aggressive.

210
00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:31.540
Who's selecting the, who's domesticating the humans? Well,

211
00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:35.050
one idea that has been specifically suggested is that a,

212
00:12:35.051 --> 00:12:40.051
it was the growing tendency for our hunter gatherer ancestors to settle down in,

213
00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:43.263
in stable

214
00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:45.870
<v 0>camps. Do you mean like summer camps?</v>

215
00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:50.540
Like sing songs around the Myrick I'm talking about communities. Look,

216
00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:52.500
if you are in a very small family group,

217
00:12:52.530 --> 00:12:55.380
well then it pays to be big and strong and mean.

218
00:12:55.381 --> 00:12:58.290
Because if you're the biggest guy and you meet a smaller guy and he's got some

219
00:12:58.291 --> 00:13:01.020
potatoes, you grab him, eat his potatoes,

220
00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:04.590
beat him up and then move on to the next till you never have to see him again.

221
00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:07.530
But let's say that as time passes,

222
00:13:07.830 --> 00:13:11.610
human society grows a little bit. You form camps,

223
00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:13.590
we might have 30 or 40 people.

224
00:13:13.770 --> 00:13:17.940
That way you can build bigger fires and you can catch more bunnies and you can

225
00:13:17.941 --> 00:13:22.620
defend against enemies. But in this world, if you beat everybody up,

226
00:13:23.370 --> 00:13:27.960
you may not survive that one pitted against anybody else one-on-one.

227
00:13:28.290 --> 00:13:30.750
The big strong mean guys turn on, we gonna win.

228
00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:34.320
When big strong mean doesn't win. And we see this in some primates,

229
00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:36.000
that's when you can start to form coalitions.

230
00:13:36.001 --> 00:13:39.750
When you can start to have multiple individuals, you say, hey mean guy, stop it.

231
00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:41.370
Yeah, you're bigger than any one of us,

232
00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:44.340
but you can't take on both of us or all three of us

233
00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:45.433
<v 3>or our whole group.</v>

234
00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:50.330
Now we've got other males in the community who aren't going to go away and they

235
00:13:50.510 --> 00:13:51.980
say, okay, we're going to deal with this guy,

236
00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:56.060
and then maybe they deal with him by shutting him down, ostracizing him

237
00:13:56.570 --> 00:13:59.000
<v 0>or even capital punishment and Richard Wrangham.</v>

238
00:13:59.001 --> 00:14:03.380
His theory is that gift that happens enough times to enough bullies who then can

239
00:14:03.381 --> 00:14:06.050
have kids and spread their genes because they have the unfortunate condition of

240
00:14:06.051 --> 00:14:06.860
being dead.

241
00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:11.860
Then we've essentially bred out the more aggressive jeans or we have

242
00:14:13.190 --> 00:14:14.750
domesticated ourselves

243
00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:17.213
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

244
00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:17.700
<v 0>we're,</v>

245
00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:22.000
we're really talking about groups versus individuals here and so in a sense I

246
00:14:22.001 --> 00:14:25.930
think we're really talking about the beginning of society and on a kind of rule

247
00:14:25.931 --> 00:14:27.460
of law in the way that we think of it

248
00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:40.820
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

249
00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:45.080
<v 0>and this pressure to be a little more gentle and to be a little bit more</v>

250
00:14:45.081 --> 00:14:47.210
cooperative. This hasn't gone away.

251
00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:50.750
I think if anything were being selected to work together more

252
00:14:51.610 --> 00:14:54.980
<v 2>[inaudible] to be able to tolerate being packed in even tighter.</v>

253
00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:59.450
If you put 20 chimps on a jet plane and tried to send them across the Atlantic,

254
00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:02.990
let me tell you that only one or two would walk off that plane alive.

255
00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:04.280
We do this all the time.

256
00:15:04.281 --> 00:15:08.690
We take it for granted as human beings that big groups of people can get along

257
00:15:08.691 --> 00:15:09.524
with one another.

258
00:15:11.450 --> 00:15:16.100
I do think that it's reasonable to imagine that humans have a future of

259
00:15:16.370 --> 00:15:18.530
increasing self domestication.

260
00:15:18.770 --> 00:15:22.670
What I sent you proposing is that as the earth gets more crowded,

261
00:15:22.671 --> 00:15:23.870
all the creatures on earth,

262
00:15:23.871 --> 00:15:26.570
or at least the ascension creatures have to start learning to live with each

263
00:15:26.571 --> 00:15:28.850
other to the mark as they keep bumping into each other.

264
00:15:29.270 --> 00:15:31.480
The winners will be the domesticated ones.

265
00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:34.640
Everyone will get more empathetic to each other because that's the only way you

266
00:15:34.641 --> 00:15:38.840
survive. Let me get gentler and gentler and gentler.

267
00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:42.050
Two lambs literally lie down with lions.

268
00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:44.030
You said it beautifully,

269
00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:51.190
<v 3>but do you, do you believe it? Well,</v>

270
00:15:51.191 --> 00:15:54.160
we may have to go through one or two ups and downs before we get the,

271
00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:58.690
and of course there's something slightly alarming about the fact that, um,

272
00:15:58.750 --> 00:16:03.070
one possible mechanism by which domestication has happened in humans is through

273
00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:07.330
literally execution of the more aggressive types,

274
00:16:07.990 --> 00:16:10.390
but in the long term. Sure.

275
00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:14.560
Let's hope that all of us become more

276
00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:16.360
[inaudible].

277
00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:20.380
<v 0>Sloppy eared. More floppy ears. Exactly.</v>

278
00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:23.900
Like patches on the ends of our tails.

279
00:16:27.550 --> 00:16:31.810
Remember when we started working together? Now you have,

280
00:16:32.110 --> 00:16:34.930
oh my God, we've domesticated. Yes. You have to have noticed.

281
00:16:34.931 --> 00:16:39.400
Your ears have been looking at me. He's like, show me your teeth.

282
00:16:39.490 --> 00:16:44.420
Smile. Anyhow, we should go to rake or not.

283
00:16:44.650 --> 00:16:46.380
No, we're gonna just go to the big break. Yeah,

284
00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:48.420
just the break that exists between us and every

285
00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:51.830
<v 2>anything else? Yeah. Let's listen to the way we ended all. Bye.</v>

286
00:16:52.370 --> 00:16:52.521
