00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.710
&gt;&gt; Tim Smith: Today I'm with
Mary Roach who is the author

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:12.110
of six books about science.

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.830
Her topics have included human
digestion to human cadaver

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:17.920
and humans in outer space.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:23.190 position:56%
Her newest book "Grunt" looks at the
curious science of humans at war.

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:26.740
The book includes vintage
Roach, boundless curiosity

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.500
and infectious enthusiasm all
written with a delightful sense

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:38.210 position:56%
of humor and there are of course
lots of maggots throughout the book.

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.580
One reviewer likened her to
the perfect dinner guest,

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:45.020
rolling out one surprising
story after another and I found

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.210
that to be very true reading this
one and reading her previous books.

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.790
"Grunt" isn't a look at the
ballistics of war or the raw power

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:57.640
of nuclear bombs, what you might
think of as military science.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.540
Her book, like all her other
books is a study primarily

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.730
of the human body and
she says I'm interested

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.190
in the parts no one
makes movies about,

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.230
not the killing but
the keeping alive.

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:10.330
Mary, thanks for being
with us today.

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.510
&gt;&gt; Mary Roach: Oh,
thank you, thank you.

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.990
[ Applause ]

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.320
&gt;&gt; Tim Smith: So, as I've said
you've written about space and sex

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:29.110
and the human body and why
the science of humans at war?

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:30.930
&gt;&gt; Mary Roach: Well, it's a
topic that I got interested

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.660
in in kind of an unusual way.

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:36.290
I was reporting a Smithsonian
magazine piece

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.400
on the world's hottest
chili peppers.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.610 position:56%
I was in India and while I was there
somebody said oh the Indian Defence

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.370
Ministry took these chili peppers
and made a non-lethal weapon,

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:52.450
kind of an, essentially a pepper
spray but in a powdered bomb that.

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.910
And I thought well I need
to report on that so I went

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:58.410
over to the Indian
Defence Ministry's lab

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:01.700
and I spent a day kind
of poking around as I do

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.000
and they were working on that.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.940
They had been working on a leech
repellant which fascinated me

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.350
and I thought that at
that point I just realized

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.450
that military science is a
little broader and more esoteric

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.620
than I had thought and
it just planted a seed

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.690
that this might be a sort of
Roachable territory as it were.

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.910
And got and then I got home.

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.260
There was a, I happened
to be corresponding

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:34.590
with a retired army pathologist
who had, I think he read "Stiff",

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.610
I'm guessing and I said you
know I'm sort of thinking

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.450
about military science but I
think access would be a problem.

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:40.750
What do you think?

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.170
And he said I think you should try
it and he introduced me to people

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.940
at the Armed Forces Medical
Examiner System at Walter Reed

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.370
and he really sort of opened
some doors and encouraged me

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.260
to run with it which I did.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.260
&gt;&gt; Tim Smith: And was the
military pretty responsive

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.750
in having you poke around?

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.140
&gt;&gt; Mary Roach: They were
surprisingly receptive to it.

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:07.000
You know it was, a lot of
times, it took a year to get.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.930
I spent some time on a ballistic
missile submarine out at sea.

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.090
That took about a year to set up
not because people were saying no,

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.960
but because nobody knew who's
the person to say 'yes'.

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:20.330
So it would be like
you'd start with a,

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:21.950
you know you'd have
the submarine group

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:26.260
and then the naval operations
person and the, you know

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.640
and then I would get approval
all the way up at the top.

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.570 position:56%
And then we had to find who wants to
be the submarine captain that goes,

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:35.310
yeah, yeah she can
come on my boat now.

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.510
So, that took some doing
so, but people were.

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:40.810
People had been.

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.610
The Department of Defence
were, I think they were.

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.660
Yeah, these are stories
that don't get told

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:46.980
and they're positive stories.

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.060
They're stories about
scientists who are trying

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.350
to make this very difficult
experience of serving

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:52.920
in the military in combat, trying

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.810
to make it a little
more bearable and safer.

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:59.220
So it's a story that I think
they were happy to tell

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:03.200
so it was surprisingly, they
were very helpful in fact.

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:08.240
They didn't, yeah they didn't have
a chance to vet the manuscript.

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:10.130
It wasn't that sort of
like, well we'll let you in

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:12.180
but in return we have
to see the manuscript.

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.350
They were, they had no real input.

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:17.390
They didn't really know
what I was doing except

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:19.940
in a very general sense.

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.700
&gt;&gt; Tim Smith: So what is the, one
of the interesting things I learned

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:26.890
in the book is it's not just
about keeping a soldier alive

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:29.880
but it's also ensuring that they
have a decent quality of life

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.720
if they have an injury
or what have you.

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.070
And if I can just read,
just two sentences.

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.510
"The long-term quality of a soldier

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:41.230
or a marine's life is a
relatively new consideration.

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:43.990
In the past, military
decision-makers have concerned

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:47.340
themselves more with go, no-go.

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.950
Do the injuries keep a soldier
from contemplating permission?

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:53.280
Have we lost another
pawn in the game?"

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:57.910
Do you have any examples
of ways that they're trying

00:04:57.910 --> 00:04:59.360
to improve the life of a soldier?

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.080
&gt;&gt; Mary Roach: Well, the whole
book is, I mean there's everything,

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.720
you know everything from you
know heat injury and heat stroke

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:11.510
which in recent conflicts has
been a big issue to diarrhea

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:15.390
which people tend to think well
that's kind of tee-hee topic.

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:19.090
Historically speaking, I mean this
was, you know you look at conflicts

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:23.420
like the Mexican War of 1848,
seven deaths from dysentery

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:26.010
and disease to one combat death.

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:27.580
In recent years with improvements

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:30.550
in sanitation you don't have the
same situation where there was

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:34.700
like sort of a mess tent set up
right next to a field latrine

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:37.290
and flies going back and
forth and no refrigeration

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:39.570
and you know hundreds of
troops getting sick with things

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:44.350 position:56%
like typhoid fever and dysentery
and dying so now we don't have that.

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:47.360
But we still, in like the Special
Operations Forces who are still

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:50.440
out in remote areas eating, you
know they're not on the base

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:53.050
where it's very sanitized
so there's a very,

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:57.330
very high food poisoning rates
so, just all manner of things

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:01.610
that you don't necessarily
think about as risks of combat.

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:05.190
These are the things that you
know I look at in the book.

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:08.070
&gt;&gt; Tim Smith: And you said at some
point in the book that the cost

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:12.130
of I guess combating food poisoning
could be as much as the cost

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:14.510
of combating Post Traumatic
Stress Disorder.

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:16.610
&gt;&gt; Mary Roach: Well, no as they
were talking about something,

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:20.680
it's called their post-infectious
consequences

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:23.810
of severe food poisoning,
irritable bowel

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:27.370 position:56%
and there's something called
reactive arthritis so, that you can,

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:29.680
you have a five-fold greater
increase of developing

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:31.950
if you've had a severe
case of food poisoning.

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:36.210
So, and that's a, you know the
VA will cover benefits for that.

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:40.210
So the diarrhea person, the
diarrhea expert that I spoke

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:45.480
to his feeling was that that could
rival in expenditures what is spent

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:50.050
on PTSD so it is, you know
definitely [inaudible] the bigger

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:54.730
problem and not one that sort of is
obvious to people when they think

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:56.390
about serving in the military.

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:58.450
&gt;&gt; Tim Smith: And am I
correct in recalling that,

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:01.140
and if I am this is a
real eye-opening fact,

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:05.500
when I read the book that a
cholera patient could discharge

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:08.900
like what is it, five
gallons of fluids?

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:11.280
&gt;&gt; Mary Roach: Yeah, that's
the statistic that I heard.

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:14.490
I mean so much so that there's a
navy Captain Philips [phonetic]

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:17.470
who I forget which
year exactly but one

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:20.500
of his contributions among
others was the invention

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:24.470
of something called the
cholera cot which is a cot

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:27.850
with a hole right here and
a bucket just because it,

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:30.950
just that you can't keep
changing the beds quickly enough.

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:33.100
It's a, and that's
why it's so fatal,

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:35.320
you just dehydrate
so quickly so yeah.

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:39.550
&gt;&gt; Tim Smith: And let's
get to the maggots.

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:40.900
I know I brought it up
in the introduction.

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:46.760 position:56%
They found that interestingly that a
maggot can be used to clean a wound.

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:49.120
&gt;&gt; Mary Roach: Yeah, this
was a World War I discovery.

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:54.470
There was a, surgeon with the
French Expeditionary Forces

00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:56.410
who was seeing patients.

00:07:56.410 --> 00:08:00.980
A few patients had come in who had
been out in the bush for a few,

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:04.150
in the field for a few days,
coming in with big wounds

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:07.280 position:56%
that had been infested with maggots.

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:10.160
And of course the natural
response is to get those

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:13.100
out of there you know fear that
they're going to promote infection.

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:16.870
And what Dr. Baer kept seeing
over and over in these patients,

00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:20.720 position:56%
in these soldiers was that when they
took away the maggots there was this

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:24.220
fresh, pink healthy tissue coming
in and there was no infection

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:27.240
which was, ran counter
to what one would expect.

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:28.890
And he noticed this over and over.

00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:32.420
In fact ten years later in
civilian life decided to try

00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:36.640
that with some cases of stubborn
infections that weren't responding

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:38.870
to normal treatment and
in fact they do work well

00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:40.370
because what a maggot does is it's,

00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:43.120
it just performs a
natural debridement

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:47.150
that that debridement is taking
away the dead tissue to encourage,

00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:50.010
to [inaudible] infection and
encourage the growth of new tissue.

00:08:50.010 --> 00:08:53.760
So that, maggots as we all
know like, they like dead stuff

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:55.060
so by putting them in there.

00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:57.640
And you have to, there's a
dosage for maggot therapy.

00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:00.130
Maggot therapy is still done today.

00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:01.890
There's a, you'll need
a prescription.

00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:03.510
&gt;&gt; Tim Smith: It has a
Medicare billing code.

00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:06.760
&gt;&gt; Mary Roach: Yes, there's
a Medicare reimbursement code

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:10.290
and a dosage and they put
something called a cage dressing.

00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:14.100
So you have this little community
there on your leg or your foot.

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:16.550
It's often in diabetic
patients with foot ulcers.

00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:19.010
They're difficult to treat.

00:09:19.010 --> 00:09:22.570
So, and you would think that it's
a very disturbing, upsetting thing

00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:27.750 position:56%
to have maggots feeding upon you in
any capacity but in fact if you have

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:30.910
that kind of infection
that is not going away

00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:34.590
and here's a possible treatment
you welcome it to the point,

00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:40.520
to the extent that some of the
folks who have been patients

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:43.900
of maggot therapy,
there are t-shirts.

00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:47.190
The company Medical Maggots
has t-shirts that say 'Maggots

00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:52.470
on Board' [laughter] so people
kind of proclaim to the world

00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:55.510
and in fact they kind of get
involved in this little community.

00:09:55.510 --> 00:09:57.080
And they're not, because they're.

00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:59.780
When you put them in
they're kind of the size

00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:01.320 position:56%
of a cupcake sprinkle, they're tiny.

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:02.680
They're not the big, fat kind

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:05.960
of squirmy Halloween
horror story maggots

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:08.220
that we're used to envisioning.

00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:10.700
They're small and they all come in.

00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:16.490 position:56%
They go head-down into the wound,
actually immerse themselves and feed

00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:18.370
in that way so that just
their butts are sticking.

00:10:18.370 --> 00:10:22.000
They actually breathe
through their ass [laughter].

00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:26.030
Among the maggots' many charms,

00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:30.060
it's an ass-breather
so they're all kind of.

00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:31.790
Just their little butts
are sticking up.

00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:34.600
It kind of looks, it reminded me
of on an accordion all the array

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:38.400
of buttons, just like these
little kind of squirmy buttons.

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:39.700
So it isn't quite.

00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:43.580
I envisioned this like sort
of like, the thing you see

00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:47.650
in a gross-out movie but it's
not really like that, anyway.

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:51.090
&gt;&gt; Tim Smith: I told you, this is
like our favorite part of Mary.

00:10:51.090 --> 00:10:55.630
So what happens if one of these
maggots inadvertently turns

00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:56.930
into a fly?

00:10:56.930 --> 00:10:58.350
I mean it wouldn't be inadvertent.

00:10:58.350 --> 00:11:00.450
It's its natural course
but [multiple speakers].

00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:01.750
&gt;&gt; Mary Roach: Ah, that is why.

00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:04.880
That's one of the reasons it's
been a bit of an uphill battle

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:08.120
for advocates of maggot therapy,
you know trying to introduce.

00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:11.260
What is the maggot sign?

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:17.590
&gt;&gt; Tim Smith: [Laughter] that's
the maggot sign [laughter].

00:11:17.590 --> 00:11:20.110
&gt;&gt; Mary Roach: [Laughter]
thank you [laughter].

00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:25.960
The, yeah because when a maggot,
a maggot is just a feeding machine

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:29.690
and it wants to eat enough
to prepare itself to go off

00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:31.680
for its very sci-fi
journey where it's going

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:33.860
to off, pupate and become a fly.

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:35.190
So, you want to.

00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:38.710
You have to remove them
after a couple of days

00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:41.440
because you don't want them
leaving, trying to leave the wound

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:44.040
and go pupate because then you
have flies in your hospital

00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:46.880
and that's the last
thing that you want.

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:49.540
So, it's a. Maggot therapy,
maggots are cheap but the,

00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:54.870
you need nursing staff to change
them, to change the cage dressing,

00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:57.160
to make sure they're not
left in too long to the point

00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:59.980
where they're all trying
to go off and hide

00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:02.680
and pupate and become flies, yeah.

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:05.990 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Tim Smith: And you I guess in the
course of your research had looked

00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:09.720
at the Office of Strategic
Service, was looking at using flies

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:12.560
as a weapon of war in
Southern Morocco was it?

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:16.000 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Mary Roach: Yeah, yeah if the OSS
which was the precursor to the CIA,

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.560
Stanley Lovell who is
the head of research,

00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:26.250
an imaginative fellow had this idea
that, because they were trying to.

00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:29.170 position:56%
This was in North Africa, they were.

00:12:29.170 --> 00:12:31.760
There was this region,
Spanish Morocco it was called

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:34.990
and they were trying to stop
the Nazis from heading in

00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:36.290
and cutting off a supply line.

00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:42.230 position:56%
Anyway they his idea was to create a
simulated, there were a lot of goats

00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:44.650
in the area so create
simulated goat dung

00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:46.320 position:56%
that would be spiked with pathogens.

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:49.130
The flies would then land
on the simulated goat dung,

00:12:49.130 --> 00:12:54.260 position:56%
pick up the pathogens and go land on
the Nazis' food, inoculate the food

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:57.210
or the Nazis directly
with these pathogens

00:12:57.210 --> 00:13:03.740
and thereby covertly destroy these
groups of Nazis who were there.

00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:05.180
So that was the idea.

00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:10.250
It was called 'Operation
Capricious', it never,

00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:13.670
sort of a play on Capricorn, goat.

00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:14.970
&gt;&gt; Tim Smith: Oh, right,
right [inaudible].

00:13:14.970 --> 00:13:20.100
&gt;&gt; Mary Roach: A little
obscure, so, it never.

00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:24.150
It was. They never
deployed the special dung

00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:25.450
and oh, this was the best part.

00:13:25.450 --> 00:13:28.090
They were going to drop the dung

00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:30.360
from airplanes in the
middle of night.

00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:35.400
And he said in his memoir, I
figured there's so much dung

00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:36.760
around no one would really notice.

00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:40.690
I think you'd notice when
someone is dropping goat dung

00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:42.340
in the middle of the night.

00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:43.720
I think that's not normal.

00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:45.020
&gt;&gt; Tim Smith: If it
falls on your tent.

00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:46.560
&gt;&gt; Mary Roach: Yes, so, yeah.

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:49.310
Anyway but it was an idea that was.

00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:50.610
That's as far as it went.

00:13:50.610 --> 00:13:51.910
I think it was just a bad.

00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:55.350
It went as, about as far
as a cocktail napkin, yeah.

00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:57.900
&gt;&gt; Tim Smith: But looking
through the dung

00:13:57.900 --> 00:14:03.620
and the flies you did find
a product called Who Me?

00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:04.920
&gt;&gt; Mary Roach: Who Me?

00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:09.650
Yeah, this was another
fanciful Stanley Lovell idea

00:14:09.650 --> 00:14:12.030
and this one was actually,
two years were spent on this.

00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:15.400
This is again World War
II and it was an idea

00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:18.720
that Lovell stole from the Brits.

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:21.450
The Brits had something
called Stench Liquid.

00:14:21.450 --> 00:14:29.840 position:56%
What this was, it was meant to be a
cheap, small, covertly-deployed tube

00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:33.720
or atomizer of hideous stink
and this would be distributed

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:38.760
to motivated citizens who,
your saboteurs who would then,

00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:43.660
when they spotted Japanese or Nazi
officers, sidle up and deploy this

00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:45.060
and it was treated like a weapon.

00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:48.090
There was like the, it was supposed
to have a range of ten feet.

00:14:48.090 --> 00:14:51.260
There could be no backfire
obviously.

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:54.540
The British one actually had a
compound that would delay the onset

00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:58.990
of the stench so that the operator
could disappear before the stench

00:14:58.990 --> 00:15:04.890
hit so it was a lot of thinking,
two years of work and some big,

00:15:04.890 --> 00:15:08.650
fat files in the OSS
archives were dedicated

00:15:08.650 --> 00:15:12.960
to this SAC23 was the
technical term.

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:17.090
Who Me? Was the nickname
that Stanley Lovell gave it.

00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:21.170
The idea being it was
supposed to just smell like,

00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:25.510
this is his words not Mary Roach's,
a very loose bowel movement.

00:15:25.510 --> 00:15:30.920 position:56%
So, the idea was to humiliate,
destroy morale and you know just by,

00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:35.320
you know just every little bit
helps in these war efforts.

00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:39.910
So thus began this highly
entertaining to me anyway,

00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:43.710
back and forth of letters between
the Arthur Little Chemical Company

00:15:43.710 --> 00:15:48.840
who were trying to come up with an
odor that was not only repellent

00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:52.650
but universally, in all cultures,
would be considered repellent

00:15:52.650 --> 00:15:57.480
and just a little bit weird
so that it was unidentifiable.

00:15:57.480 --> 00:16:01.700
They wanted it in like a mix, not
entirely the loose [inaudible]

00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:06.760 position:56%
but something added to it so that it
would be scary as well as hideous.

00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:09.440
So, that's what you
want with a malodorant

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:11.490
and those are still
things that yeah,

00:16:11.490 --> 00:16:15.060
more recently the military
has funded you know

00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:18.030
into crowd dispersal
that kind of thing.

00:16:18.030 --> 00:16:20.590
So you want it to be
foreign smelling

00:16:20.590 --> 00:16:22.860
so somebody says I don't know what
that is and it's freaking me out.

00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:24.160
I'm going to leave.

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:27.930
So it's got to be not only foul
but a little bit confusing,

00:16:27.930 --> 00:16:30.430
unidentifiable and
scary so there is.

00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:32.950
So, they went back and forth
and then the testing began

00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:34.250
and they were testing it

00:16:34.250 --> 00:16:36.750
like in tropical conditions
and Arctic conditions.

00:16:36.750 --> 00:16:38.580
And it had to be you
know the tubes would have

00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:40.450
to withstand a certain
amount of drop force.

00:16:40.450 --> 00:16:43.330
And then they would be delivered to
the people who were testing them.

00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:46.550
And they'd show up and half of them
were leaking and then they had,

00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:52.470
they had a lot of problems with
blowback and backfire [laughter]

00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:56.650
and dribble so a lot of
angry letters back and forth

00:16:56.650 --> 00:17:01.210 position:56%
between the people who had, you know
commissioned these both the state

00:17:01.210 --> 00:17:04.690
and the deployment system.

00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:08.690
And in the end, Who Me?, they
produced a whole batch of it

00:17:08.690 --> 00:17:14.510
and then 17 days later after the
final, final report on Who Me?

00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:19.000
The first bomb was dropped on
the Japanese so they never.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.060
So the stink bomb never
was deployed.

00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:26.060
&gt;&gt; Tim Smith: But they also
found that like a stench

00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:29.110
or a smell is not universal
and that it can also hinge

00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:32.040
on the environment and?

00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:33.340
&gt;&gt; Mary Roach: Yeah, that's right.

00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:37.930
I mean if you take butyric acid
is, if you smell it in a deli,

00:17:37.930 --> 00:17:40.210
you know a cheese shop it's part.

00:17:40.210 --> 00:17:41.780
You sniff a piece of
Parmesan cheese,

00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:44.510
that is, that's butyric acid.

00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:48.780
It's also, it's vomit, the
smell of vomit so depending

00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:52.430
on the context it's you know it's
kind of a pleasant cheesy smell

00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:55.540
or it's an unpleasant vomit smell.

00:17:55.540 --> 00:17:59.080
And the Monell Chemical
Senses Center

00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:01.340
who has done some work more
recently for the military

00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:05.680
on malodorants you know
for dispersing a mob

00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:09.620
or clearing a space, a
compound or whatever,

00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:15.070
they in the 1990s travelled
around with this woman Pam Dalton,

00:18:15.070 --> 00:18:18.900
travelled around and in her
suitcase she had little bottles.

00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:22.540
She had vomit, sewage, burnt hair

00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:25.090
and U.S. government
standard bathroom malodor.

00:18:25.090 --> 00:18:28.690
And she, which was
in fact the winner,

00:18:28.690 --> 00:18:30.810
this being a compound
developed in World War II

00:18:30.810 --> 00:18:32.990
for testing latrine deodorants.

00:18:32.990 --> 00:18:36.680
You need to standardize
hideous latrine smell

00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:40.610 position:56%
against which you'd try out your
latrine deodorants so this compound,

00:18:40.610 --> 00:18:43.840
this was the winner
internationally, globally,

00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:47.240
culturally because she would
take these odors around

00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:50.210
and just presenting them
to people out of context.

00:18:50.210 --> 00:18:52.600
Something like 3% of
Caucasians found vomit

00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:58.080
to be a wearable scent
like [inaudible].

00:18:59.170 --> 00:19:01.720
Sewage in many cultures, there
was a percentage of people

00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:03.020
who thought yeah, that's edible.

00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:07.680 position:56%
I would eat that so the U.S.
government standard bathroom malodor

00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:08.980
was the winner.

00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:10.710
What was interesting is
that once you had that,

00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:17.330 position:56%
that universally offensive and
hideous smell the subtly here which,

00:19:17.330 --> 00:19:21.200
this was why you need the pros at
the Monell Chemical Senses Center.

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:23.240
They added a fruity,
floral top note,

00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:26.830
the top note being the first thing
you get so when you're exposed

00:19:26.830 --> 00:19:29.290
to a new smell you are tentative.

00:19:29.290 --> 00:19:32.160
You take a little whiff and
that's, that was the fruity,

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:35.520
floral and then you're
encouraged because that's pleasant

00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:39.050
to take a big keeper, inhale.

00:19:39.050 --> 00:19:42.080
So, on the keeper inhale
you would get this onslaught

00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:44.240
of this hideous smell.

00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:50.070
So that whole package is known
as stench soup and that is.

00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:52.640
I don't know where
stench soup was deployed

00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:54.130
and neither does Pam Dalton.

00:19:54.130 --> 00:19:55.480
She said I gave them the formula.

00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:57.560
I don't know what they did with it.

00:19:57.560 --> 00:20:01.360
It's somewhere out there
probably somebody's got a supply

00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:02.660
of stench soup.

00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:05.790
I myself had some that sat in my
closet in a little vial for a long,

00:20:05.790 --> 00:20:09.900
long time with, you know
encased in activated charcoal.

00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:12.550
And I finally got the courage
on the book tour to open it up

00:20:12.550 --> 00:20:15.060
and there was a lot of fanfare
like I'm going to open this up.

00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:17.060
It was at a big event
and I was going to,

00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:19.140
I thought of taking
it, no never mind.

00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:21.290
&gt;&gt; Tim Smith: Let's throw
some out here [laughter].

00:20:21.290 --> 00:20:24.140
&gt;&gt; Mary Roach: [Laughter] so but
all of the scent had been absorbed

00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:28.050
into the activated carbon and so it
was this large anticlimactic moment

00:20:28.050 --> 00:20:32.390
but I did smell some
at Monell and it is.

00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:36.280
You do not open that without the
fume hood, under the fume hood

00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:38.890
with the fans going and that's.

00:20:38.890 --> 00:20:40.810
It's pretty bad.

00:20:40.810 --> 00:20:42.230
&gt;&gt; Tim Smith: So, I guess one.

00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:43.530
&gt;&gt; Mary Roach: I should
have brought some.

00:20:43.530 --> 00:20:44.830
Can you?

00:20:44.830 --> 00:20:46.130
&gt;&gt; Tim Smith: Well,
aren't you curious now?

00:20:46.130 --> 00:20:47.960
&gt;&gt; Mary Roach: [Inaudible] spritz.

00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:50.080
&gt;&gt; Tim Smith: So, one of the
most life-changing injuries

00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:53.040
that you've discussed in the
book are injuries to the penis.

00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:54.340
&gt;&gt; Mary Roach: Yes.

00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:55.640 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Tim Smith: And the male genitals.

00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:56.940
And this is, I guess it was kind

00:20:56.940 --> 00:20:58.920
of an awkward subject
for a lot of people.

00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:00.220
&gt;&gt; Mary Roach: Yes.

00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:01.520
&gt;&gt; Tim Smith: I'm sure it was
awkward for the military as well

00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:03.150
but what are some of
the improvements

00:21:03.150 --> 00:21:04.900
that they're making there?

00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:06.200
&gt;&gt; Mary Roach: Yeah, yeah.

00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:11.150
Yeah, urogenital trauma is the
more technical term and it's become

00:21:11.150 --> 00:21:15.250
in recent conflicts, it's become
more of a problem for two reasons.

00:21:15.250 --> 00:21:21.020
One, the size of the bombs, the
IEDs, they're bigger so it's not

00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:24.370
like you know a land mine you
would tend to you know lost a limb,

00:21:24.370 --> 00:21:26.480
maybe to here, maybe here.

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:29.930
And now these are bigger explosions
going up to the pelvic region.

00:21:29.930 --> 00:21:31.670
And the other thing
that's happened is

00:21:31.670 --> 00:21:37.840
that medical emergency trauma care
in the field has become better

00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:42.260
and faster so more men are
surviving to have these injuries

00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:44.290
to the groin area, the penis.

00:21:44.290 --> 00:21:50.760
And so the surgical, I was at
Walter Reed where there was,

00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:54.060
they were repairing the urethra
of a young man who'd had,

00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:55.770
who had sustained such an injury.

00:21:55.770 --> 00:22:01.170
And it was fascinating in that, you
know I came into the operating room

00:22:01.170 --> 00:22:03.680
and you know they put the blankets,

00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:06.630
you know the drapes I guess
they're called, surgical drapes,

00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:08.500
and normally you know
they just leave the part

00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:10.580
that they're working
on, and oddly they were

00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:13.320
up at his face which I thought odd.

00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:17.600
And but what they were doing, they
take a rectangle of the inside

00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:21.260
of the cheek because that's,
first of all it's hairless.

00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:24.540
And for a urethra you
don't want there to be hair

00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:28.440 position:56%
because minerals cans collect on the
hair and you can end up with stones

00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:30.470
and so you don't want hair.

00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:33.380
And you also want tissue
that is going to be able

00:22:33.380 --> 00:22:38.660 position:56%
to withstand a moist environment
and the inside of the cheek is that.

00:22:38.660 --> 00:22:42.260
So, they took a little rectangle
and they would roll it into a tube

00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:45.960
and use it basically to patch
the urethra, and in that way,

00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:49.490
he would still be able to pee
through his penis, rather than,

00:22:49.490 --> 00:22:54.660
because if you can't do that they
thread it through the perineum.

00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:58.550
It's a word I've often.

00:22:58.550 --> 00:22:59.850
&gt;&gt; Tim Smith: Read but
not heard [laughter].

00:22:59.850 --> 00:23:01.410
&gt;&gt; Mary Roach: Yes,
read but not heard.

00:23:01.410 --> 00:23:04.010
Anyway the [inaudible] I believe
the [inaudible] is [inaudible].

00:23:05.270 --> 00:23:07.600
The more casual term,
anyway they would have

00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:10.320 position:56%
to thread the urethra and you would.

00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:12.870
Then he would have to sit
down over the toilet to pee.

00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:15.290
And I had this conversation
in the operating room

00:23:15.290 --> 00:23:16.800
with a surgeon, the
assisting surgeon.

00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:18.800
The assisting surgeon was a woman.

00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:20.100
The surgeon was a man.

00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:24.550
And I said, you know how big a deal
is that to have to pee you know

00:23:24.550 --> 00:23:31.830
through the perineum and he
said, the surgeon said well,

00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:36.420
given all of the other challenges
of losing a limb et cetera

00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:38.270
and I don't think it's
that big a deal.

00:23:38.270 --> 00:23:43.520
And the woman turned to me, the
assisting surgeon said it's huge.

00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:47.770
So, you know and so the
surgery was you know,

00:23:47.770 --> 00:23:51.430
it did what it was supposed
to do and he's now able

00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:58.060
to urinate normally and while I
was there the surgeon happened

00:23:58.060 --> 00:24:01.110 position:56%
to mention something going on at
Johns Hopkins which, I mean this was

00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:03.890
about two years ago, I hadn't
heard about that they were.

00:24:03.890 --> 00:24:08.210
He said over at Johns Hopkins
right now there's a surgeon,

00:24:08.210 --> 00:24:14.380
they're doing what's called a wet
run which is using cadavers to work

00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:17.060
out the logistics of
a penis transplant.

00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:20.490
And the first penis transplant
was a few months ago and that was

00:24:20.490 --> 00:24:24.650
at Mass General, not Johns
Hopkins but I was able to see

00:24:24.650 --> 00:24:26.430
and it was just fascinating.

00:24:26.430 --> 00:24:29.590
It was, you know they had two,
two bodies you know the recipient

00:24:29.590 --> 00:24:36.560
and the donor and one circumcised
and one not which was interesting.

00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:40.230
They're dead, it doesn't
matter but anyway just to,

00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:41.750
you know and they had it.

00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:47.260
They had this set up where they
had a, you know an IV and a bag

00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:51.480
of dyed saline, dyed blue and you
could you know turn the stopcock

00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:54.240
and they had hooked it
up to a certain artery

00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:58.350
and they could then see what
region was profused by this artery

00:24:58.350 --> 00:25:02.030
and that would tell them you know,
is a critical artery to reattach?

00:25:02.030 --> 00:25:06.750
Is this you know an important
one and how material do we take?

00:25:06.750 --> 00:25:09.210
And you don't just lop
it off like a tree.

00:25:09.210 --> 00:25:10.510
I mean you have to take the roots.

00:25:10.510 --> 00:25:13.680
You've got to take, sorry anyway.

00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:17.850
I don't even remember
what your question was.

00:25:17.850 --> 00:25:19.150 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Tim Smith: This was two chapters.

00:25:19.150 --> 00:25:23.280
&gt;&gt; Mary Roach: Oh, but I was going
to say you had asked me what sorts

00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:24.580
of things are being done.

00:25:24.580 --> 00:25:27.520
And one of the things I found
interesting was that the,

00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:31.200 position:56%
some of the surgical techniques, the
reconstruction, not transplantation

00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:34.840
and not just repairing a urethra
but reconstruction, some of that is

00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:37.590
in you know in collaboration
between military surgeons

00:25:37.590 --> 00:25:40.900
and transgender surgeons so
you know you don't often sort

00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:46.040
of imagine the military and the
transgender sort of community like.

00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:47.350
I don't know, getting together

00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:50.660
and helping each other,
it was lovely, lovely.

00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:51.960
&gt;&gt; Tim Smith: So, one
more question on this

00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:53.260
and then I'll move to underwear.

00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:57.470
Actually I think I just
forgot my question.

00:25:57.470 --> 00:25:59.750
So we'll move on to underwear.

00:25:59.750 --> 00:26:04.560
Why are silk underwear the best
underwear to wear in a war zone?

00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:09.130
&gt;&gt; Mary Roach: Well, silk
is surprisingly strong.

00:26:09.130 --> 00:26:16.460
It's very lightweight and strong
and so it's, it's used to.

00:26:16.460 --> 00:26:18.950
It's not going to be
bulletproof but in terms of.

00:26:18.950 --> 00:26:20.850
I mean people think of Kavala.

00:26:20.850 --> 00:26:23.960
They think just that Kavala, you
could make a pair of underpants

00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:25.260
that would be bulletproof.

00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:30.120
Like you'd need like 15 to 40 plies
to be actually, yeah it's not going

00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:32.910
to be a comfortable
pair of underpants.

00:26:32.910 --> 00:26:37.430
So, silk is, silk is almost
as protective I mean in terms

00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:39.670
of just you know a light layer.

00:26:39.670 --> 00:26:42.730
And it's not protecting
against a bomb or a gunshot

00:26:42.730 --> 00:26:44.030
but what it's protecting you

00:26:44.030 --> 00:26:48.550
against if there's an IED
explosion you know the tremendous,

00:26:48.550 --> 00:26:49.990
because these are buried bombs

00:26:49.990 --> 00:26:53.960
so they are launching
at very high speed.

00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:57.990
Dirt, sand, debris
and a lot of pathogens

00:26:57.990 --> 00:26:59.560
and what happens when an IED.

00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:03.810
You step on an IED or very near an
IED the tissue kind of blows out

00:27:03.810 --> 00:27:08.120
and the debris blow goes in
and then the tissue comes back

00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:12.040
and you can have, just have
horrendous recurring infection.

00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:16.260
So, underwear or what you
know not necessarily just

00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:18.630
for underwear but that's.

00:27:18.630 --> 00:27:23.250
It's very good whether it's
silk or a few plies of Kavala,

00:27:23.250 --> 00:27:26.370
it's keeping that material
from penetrating.

00:27:26.370 --> 00:27:29.630
So, there isn't any,
you used to read.

00:27:29.630 --> 00:27:31.770
There was a time when one
of these companies was sort

00:27:31.770 --> 00:27:36.530
of marketing bomb-proof underwear
which you know is the guy

00:27:36.530 --> 00:27:39.120
at Natick Labs where
they work on underwear,

00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:41.600
he said you know if
they can develop.

00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:45.040
If the surgeons can make a bomb
that will flip a mine-resistant arm

00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:47.730
and personnel carrier they can
certainly make a bomb that's going

00:27:47.730 --> 00:27:49.050
to blow up your underwear.

00:27:49.050 --> 00:27:52.080
So, it's not bomb-proof
but it does help a lot

00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:55.230
in preventing infection yeah.

00:27:55.230 --> 00:27:57.810
&gt;&gt; Tim Smith: And when
you're a combat medic you're

00:27:57.810 --> 00:28:01.850
in a real high-stress situation
and I mean a lot of us,

00:28:01.850 --> 00:28:05.610
our instincts are not
like focused on one thing

00:28:05.610 --> 00:28:07.840
and you observed medics
getting trained?

00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:11.710
&gt;&gt; Mary Roach: Yes, yeah, yeah
the challenge like you mentioned.

00:28:11.710 --> 00:28:14.130
If you're in a [inaudible]
area where there's loud noises

00:28:14.130 --> 00:28:17.230
and people shooting, whether
they're shooting at you or not,

00:28:17.230 --> 00:28:19.940
it's a. You have a burst
of adrenalin and a fight

00:28:19.940 --> 00:28:23.040
or flight response and what
that does is it makes you fast,

00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:25.060
strong and dumb is the
way they describe it.

00:28:25.060 --> 00:28:28.710
It makes you able to run
away, throw a big rock,

00:28:28.710 --> 00:28:31.930
whatever you know just
sort of brute strength.

00:28:31.930 --> 00:28:36.580
It does not help you focus,
make good cognitive choices,

00:28:36.580 --> 00:28:42.520
operate delicate machinery
or cut an airway in somebody

00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:44.100
who is struggling to breathe.

00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:49.870
What it does for you, the opposite
of what you need so combat medics

00:28:49.870 --> 00:28:54.370
and Navy corpsmen who provide
medical care for the Marine Corps,

00:28:54.370 --> 00:28:57.880
they're trained at places
like strategic operations

00:28:57.880 --> 00:28:59.440
which is this old movie studio,

00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:02.020
a big movie studio
near Camp Pendleton.

00:29:02.020 --> 00:29:05.430
The guy who owns it used to do
action movies and war movies

00:29:05.430 --> 00:29:10.170
so he's got a lot of technology
for loud noises, pyrotechnics

00:29:10.170 --> 00:29:12.350
and he employs actors

00:29:12.350 --> 00:29:16.040
to play injured people
including amputee actors.

00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:19.970
The day I was there, there was this
amputee who had a sleeve over the,

00:29:19.970 --> 00:29:23.990
his leg and it had been very
artfully designed with gore

00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:26.310
and it had a backpack
with just the right amount

00:29:26.310 --> 00:29:27.820
of stage blood and a pump.

00:29:27.820 --> 00:29:30.550
It would pump so he could and
he could control the bleed

00:29:30.550 --> 00:29:32.320
in a realistic way and depending

00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:37.960
on how the medic applied the
tourniquet could either be saved

00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:39.260
or die.

00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:42.940
And he was acting that role along
with it and screaming and making,

00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:46.730
you know making things as stressful
as possible for this young man

00:29:46.730 --> 00:29:49.890
so that he could practise doing
care in a stressful environment.

00:29:49.890 --> 00:29:54.670
And the hope being if you do it
a few times in a safe environment

00:29:54.670 --> 00:29:58.460
and learn to cope with that
and maintain your focus,

00:29:58.460 --> 00:29:59.930
hopefully you'll be
a little better off

00:29:59.930 --> 00:30:03.400 position:56%
when the real deal unfolds overseas.

00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:08.380
So that is part of the training
and it's fairly intense.

00:30:08.380 --> 00:30:09.680
I mean there were pyrotechnics.

00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:11.510
They had dust hit so it looked

00:30:11.510 --> 00:30:14.160
like right rifle fire was
hitting the ground and [inaudible]

00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:18.140
and all the while the instructors
were sort of yelling and adding

00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:22.070
to the stress in that sort of
boot camp Marine instructor way.

00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:28.890
So, it was not a pleasant day
for those young men and women

00:30:28.890 --> 00:30:32.540
but hopefully helpful for
them in the long-term.

00:30:32.540 --> 00:30:34.640
&gt;&gt; Tim Smith: So I'll ask one more
question and then we'll turn it

00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:37.060 position:56%
over to questions from the audience.

00:30:37.060 --> 00:30:41.920
But I guess the highest
achievement in the science

00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:43.720
of war would be making
war not lethal.

00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:47.560
Is there any chance
of that happening?

00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:51.400
&gt;&gt; Mary Roach: Well, if it's
all, if it's all, well not lethal

00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:54.090
to both sides or to one side?

00:30:54.090 --> 00:30:56.170
&gt;&gt; Tim Smith: Honest, I guess
both, I guess if it's not lethal

00:30:56.170 --> 00:30:58.020
to one side maybe it's
not lethal to the other.

00:30:58.020 --> 00:30:59.890
&gt;&gt; Mary Roach: Well then
it's called diplomacy.

00:30:59.890 --> 00:31:01.930
&gt;&gt; Tim Smith: Well that's
true too, good point.

00:31:01.930 --> 00:31:03.230 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Mary Roach: And I'm all for that.

00:31:03.230 --> 00:31:05.940
Yeah, I mean there's a lot of,

00:31:05.940 --> 00:31:10.580
you know of course moving towards
using drones in the place of boots

00:31:10.580 --> 00:31:13.180
on the ground which
is a policy issue.

00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:15.840
I don't really write about that.

00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:17.140
&gt;&gt; Tim Smith: Right.

00:31:17.140 --> 00:31:18.630
&gt;&gt; Mary Roach: But certainly
that seems to be the direction

00:31:18.630 --> 00:31:21.040
that things are going, yeah.

00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:22.490
&gt;&gt; Tim Smith: So, let's
turn it over to you.

00:31:22.490 --> 00:31:27.830 position:56%
We microphones to my right and to my
left, and if you have any questions

00:31:27.830 --> 00:31:32.110
about this book or any of her
previous books, get up and ask.

00:31:32.110 --> 00:31:35.360
I think we've got about
ten minutes left or so.

00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:38.000
Yes mam?

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:39.300
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Speaker
1: Hi, I'm a big fan.

00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:41.460
You tend to write a
lot about subjects

00:31:41.460 --> 00:31:43.370
that people tend to
be squeamish about.

00:31:43.370 --> 00:31:47.280
Do you have any techniques for
getting people to talk about these

00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:49.600
in ways that they're
more comfortable?

00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:51.650
&gt;&gt; Mary Roach: By that you mean
the people that I'm interviewing,

00:31:51.650 --> 00:31:53.550
the researchers or scientists?

00:31:53.550 --> 00:31:54.850
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Speaker 1: Yeah.

00:31:54.850 --> 00:31:56.150
&gt;&gt; Mary Roach: Yeah, yeah they are.

00:31:56.150 --> 00:32:01.920
They tend to be squeamish
topics but if say you're someone

00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:07.470
who researches human sexual
response or in women in particular,

00:32:07.470 --> 00:32:12.090
having a conversation about the
clitoris or about the amount

00:32:12.090 --> 00:32:13.560
of blood in the vaginal walls,

00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:15.430
that's just your day-to-day
that's not,

00:32:15.430 --> 00:32:17.320
so they're not at all squeamish.

00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:19.940
And for them it's like having
a conversation about you know,

00:32:19.940 --> 00:32:21.940
tire rotation or something,
it's not.

00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:27.370
There's no charge to the topic,
it's actually very easy to step in

00:32:27.370 --> 00:32:30.090
and have a conversation with
someone about their work

00:32:30.090 --> 00:32:32.210
because for them it's
just their job.

00:32:32.210 --> 00:32:34.670
So I don't really have
any techniques other

00:32:34.670 --> 00:32:37.200
than just being very
straightforward with them.

00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:38.500
Yeah?

00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:40.620
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Speaker
2: Hi, I was interested,

00:32:40.620 --> 00:32:45.040
during your research did you go
out to Forest Glen to the Museum

00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:49.010
of Military Medicine to
study any of the information

00:32:49.010 --> 00:32:50.310
that they have out there?

00:32:50.310 --> 00:32:52.330 position:56%
And if so, what was your impression?

00:32:52.330 --> 00:32:53.630
&gt;&gt; Mary Roach: I did not.

00:32:53.630 --> 00:32:59.310 position:56%
I, years ago went to the AFIP museum
where they have like the collection

00:32:59.310 --> 00:33:03.900
of bones and gunshot
injuries and things like that.

00:33:03.900 --> 00:33:05.940
I don't know if that is, that's.

00:33:05.940 --> 00:33:08.000
I know that AFIP museum moved.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:09.450
I don't know if that's
where it moved.

00:33:09.450 --> 00:33:10.770
Is that separate?

00:33:10.770 --> 00:33:12.920
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Speaker 2:
That was at Walter Reed,

00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:14.450
that's where it moved out to.

00:33:14.450 --> 00:33:15.750
&gt;&gt; Mary Roach: Yes.

00:33:15.750 --> 00:33:17.160
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Speaker 2:
It's in a brand new building.

00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:20.710
&gt;&gt; Mary Roach: I haven't been
and I would love to, yeah.

00:33:20.710 --> 00:33:22.100
&gt;&gt; Tim Smith: Yes?

00:33:22.100 --> 00:33:23.460
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Speaker 3: Hi.

00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:24.950
&gt;&gt; Mary Roach: Hi.

00:33:24.950 --> 00:33:27.430
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Speaker 3: I
love that you take one tiny topic

00:33:27.430 --> 00:33:32.100
and you go ten miles deep
with it or 100 miles deep.

00:33:32.100 --> 00:33:36.370
Do you find that there's one core
message in all of your books?

00:33:36.370 --> 00:33:40.170
What's the one story
you're always telling?

00:33:40.170 --> 00:33:42.200
&gt;&gt; Mary Roach: If there's
one core message,

00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:45.100
well there are a couple
of core, one is.

00:33:45.100 --> 00:33:49.440
I mean I'm fascinated by
the human body in extreme

00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:55.840 position:56%
and unusual situations and to me you
know I used to in my 20s do a lot

00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:57.800
of overseas, just travel.

00:33:57.800 --> 00:34:00.250
I was just always looking
to go to far-flung

00:34:00.250 --> 00:34:01.810
and the more remote the better

00:34:01.810 --> 00:34:06.940
and at a certain point I realized
the human body is a foreign planet

00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:12.070
and it's so interesting to
explore and I never get tired of it

00:34:12.070 --> 00:34:13.950
and I still have so much to learn.

00:34:13.950 --> 00:34:18.820
So, and I enjoy sort of sharing
the learning with my readers so.

00:34:18.820 --> 00:34:24.500
And I guess the other core is
scientists are so smart, fun,

00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:28.350
cool and interesting and
I you know I guess I'm,

00:34:28.350 --> 00:34:32.650
so I probably should have
been one but so being able

00:34:32.650 --> 00:34:36.880
to just you know knock on these
doors and step into these worlds

00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:40.680
and find out what people are doing
and just the commitment and passion

00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:44.020
that they have for their work
is endlessly inspiring so over

00:34:44.020 --> 00:34:46.130
and over that's what I encounter.

00:34:46.130 --> 00:34:47.430
Yeah?

00:34:47.430 --> 00:34:48.730
&gt;&gt; Tim Smith: Over here.

00:34:48.730 --> 00:34:50.030
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Speaker 4: Hi.

00:34:50.030 --> 00:34:51.330
&gt;&gt; Mary Roach: Hi.

00:34:51.330 --> 00:34:52.630
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Speaker
4: I have two thoughts.

00:34:52.630 --> 00:34:53.930
I want to try to tie them together
because they're kind of related.

00:34:53.930 --> 00:34:55.230
So you mentioned when we first sat

00:34:55.230 --> 00:34:57.240
down Roachable territory,
I think you said.

00:34:57.240 --> 00:34:59.910
So, have you come across anything

00:34:59.910 --> 00:35:03.290
that you find is not
Roachable territory

00:35:03.290 --> 00:35:06.280
or maybe something you're
not willing to talk about?

00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:09.240
And kind of related, I know a
lot of your books obviously are

00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:13.240
about the human experience but you
go into animal stuff and for me,

00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:16.260
that's hard for me to read
personally so I've had to kind

00:35:16.260 --> 00:35:17.610
of like skip over some of that.

00:35:17.610 --> 00:35:20.260
Is there anything you
won't talk about?

00:35:20.260 --> 00:35:22.560
&gt;&gt; Mary Roach: Oh yes, well
I would say 90 some percent

00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:25.570
of science isn't particularly
Roachable because it's gone

00:35:25.570 --> 00:35:28.720
into the microscopic,
you know it's molecular.

00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:30.020
It's genomic.

00:35:30.020 --> 00:35:35.990 position:56%
It's not bodies on a slab which is
really my terrain and so I'm really.

00:35:35.990 --> 00:35:38.830
It's a very small sliver
of science in a way.

00:35:38.830 --> 00:35:42.830
I'm kind of a gateway
drug to science and I,

00:35:42.830 --> 00:35:44.250
which a role that I love.

00:35:44.250 --> 00:35:48.110
I love when young people read the
book, get excited about science

00:35:48.110 --> 00:35:50.590
and think I want to do science
and then of course there they are

00:35:50.590 --> 00:35:52.700
in molecular biology
going damn you Mary Roach.

00:35:52.700 --> 00:35:55.370
This is hard [laughter].

00:35:55.370 --> 00:35:58.140
But fortunately they keep going
and then they go to medical school

00:35:58.140 --> 00:36:00.600
and they become researchers
or doctors so.

00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:03.850
But have I, well yes I
agree with you the animal,

00:36:03.850 --> 00:36:05.540
the animal studies, I wouldn't.

00:36:05.540 --> 00:36:10.610
I mean I, that is an
interesting part of science.

00:36:10.610 --> 00:36:14.370
I know a friend of mine is an
author, Rebecca [inaudible]

00:36:14.370 --> 00:36:16.920
who wrote that book "The Immortal
Life of Henrietta [inaudible]".

00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:19.290
She's working on a
book right now about.

00:36:19.290 --> 00:36:22.040
Oh man, I wasn't supposed
to reveal that.

00:36:22.040 --> 00:36:24.980
I'm sorry [inaudible] but it
has to do, because she used

00:36:24.980 --> 00:36:28.470
to be a veterinary technician
so it's about that whole world

00:36:28.470 --> 00:36:32.460
and you know it makes
sense for her to do that.

00:36:32.460 --> 00:36:37.650
I would be uncomfortable
on a lot of levels.

00:36:37.650 --> 00:36:41.590
Also my tone I don't think
is appropriate and I,

00:36:41.590 --> 00:36:43.950
so that yes I agree with you.

00:36:43.950 --> 00:36:46.890
And the segments that you've
skipped, the little bit.

00:36:46.890 --> 00:36:48.700
Those are when people like.

00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:50.000
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Speaker
4: I kind of glanced over.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:51.560
&gt;&gt; Mary Roach: So yeah,
yeah, you skimmed them.

00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:56.180
Yeah, people will write to me and
share that, not in an angry way

00:36:56.180 --> 00:36:58.930
but say I had trouble with that.

00:36:58.930 --> 00:37:03.490
So, yeah you won't probably see
me doing that as a topic but.

00:37:03.490 --> 00:37:04.790
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Speaker 4: Thanks.

00:37:04.790 --> 00:37:06.870
&gt;&gt; Tim Smith: To the left, sir?

00:37:06.870 --> 00:37:09.560
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Speaker 5:
Yes, on a related topic,

00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:11.240
what happens to those maggots

00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:15.030
after they've been used
to clean the wound?

00:37:15.030 --> 00:37:17.920
And the same question
goes for leeches?

00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:19.940
&gt;&gt; Mary Roach: Yeah, oh
yes after they're removed

00:37:19.940 --> 00:37:23.280
from the wound they go to a
maggot retirement community

00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:29.550 position:56%
where they're cared for, lavished
with lots of lovely dead [laughter].

00:37:29.550 --> 00:37:36.780
Yeah, I don't know if they're
taken outdoors to go pupate.

00:37:36.780 --> 00:37:40.440
Hopefully, hopefully they are
and I think having the man

00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:44.100
who runs Medical Maggots has such
a. You know after the book came

00:37:44.100 --> 00:37:48.620 position:56%
out he sent me this box with a
little tube with alcohol and a bunch

00:37:48.620 --> 00:37:52.380
of little maggots in there as a
gift for me, a little [inaudible].

00:37:52.380 --> 00:37:58.740
He has a. I like to think that they
are set free to become flies so

00:37:58.740 --> 00:38:01.770
but I'm not entirely
sure that that's true.

00:38:01.770 --> 00:38:05.540
&gt;&gt; Tim Smith: So we've got time for
one more question and it will be.

00:38:05.540 --> 00:38:07.760
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Speaker 6:
Okay, the pressure's on, hello.

00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:09.060
&gt;&gt; Mary Roach: Hi.

00:38:09.060 --> 00:38:10.360
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Speaker
6: So my question is

00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:11.660
of all the scientists
you've read about,

00:38:11.660 --> 00:38:12.960
of all the scientists you've
met, who are a few who stand

00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:14.540
out to you as like unsung heroes?

00:38:14.540 --> 00:38:17.760
&gt;&gt; Mary Roach: Oh, well just
because we happen to be on maggots,

00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:23.530
George Peck the maggot guy, trying
to get the folks at Walter Reed

00:38:23.530 --> 00:38:27.200
to say, you know to see the value
of this because there are a lot

00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:28.790
of problems with infection.

00:38:28.790 --> 00:38:30.950
And just, you know this is a
man who had me into his home

00:38:30.950 --> 00:38:33.940
and he said I've raised a clutch
of maggots for you so you can.

00:38:33.940 --> 00:38:36.070
And he came in and this
was at the dinner table,

00:38:36.070 --> 00:38:37.370
he had this little cut glass bowl

00:38:37.370 --> 00:38:40.690
and I thought it was chocolate
pudding but it was raw liver

00:38:40.690 --> 00:38:43.840
and there were these maggots
and he said look at them.

00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:46.680
Look at them, those mandibles
can do what no surgeon can

00:38:46.680 --> 00:38:51.880
and he had this passion for maggots
and I just love people like that.

00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:56.090 position:56%
I mean just anyway George Peck comes
to mind but there would be dozens

00:38:56.090 --> 00:39:01.850
of them, not maggots,
scientists, scientists that I love.

00:39:01.850 --> 00:39:03.150
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Speaker

you so much, thanks.
