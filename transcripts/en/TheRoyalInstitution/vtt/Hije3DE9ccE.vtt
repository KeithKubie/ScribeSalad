00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:18.939
Space log 034:

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:28.050
From where I am, the earth rotates with alarming
speed. I watch as it sucks and spews, a weather

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.300
system of wet lace.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:40.960
My atmosphere is torn with fragments, splinters,
scraps of floating metal. You cannot see this

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:48.589
junk yard from earth. But here it is. It can
only be a matter of time before I collide

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:56.100
with another orbit, and I am fragmented beyond
repair. For now, I am a phantom part floating

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:09.159
in space hoping to be reconnected to my mothership.
There is no sign of the rest of me.

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:19.990
I know it probably sounds to you like I’m
doing well to keep my spirits up but if I’m

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:26.539
honest, I have sunk into a deep ennui. All
I can do is look for distraction, lest I am

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:33.429
driven to it. It is one of these distractions
that I wish to relay to you now. It has presented

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:40.600
a most perplexing existential riddle that
I have been unable to unravel.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.210
It all began a few orbits ago, when I was
awoken by a shattering of light so bright

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:59.240
I can only assume it was a nearby collision.
A starving beat reverberated through space.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:05.329
As my eyes began to focus all around me I
saw bodies, damaged and deranged. Some big

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:11.280
some small, all shapes and sizes, complacent
in their appearance but virulent in their

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.392
disposition. They put me right on edge.

00:02:14.392 --> 00:02:27.340
I called out over the chaos, and enquired
as to their nature. Amidst much gaffawing,

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.310
“We’re the same as you” was what they
replied, which kind of annoyed me, because

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:38.040
they didn’t know anything about me. I explained
that I had been separated from my mother ship,

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.890
and I was waiting to find it so that I could
continue my mission. This seemed to peak their

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:44.910
curiosity.

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:51.220
“Oh!” they said, “we mistook you for
a common scrap! Tell us, what genius have

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.860
your strangled sides been designed for?”

00:02:53.860 --> 00:03:00.100
“I am part of a space ship. There was an
accident and I was separated, I am merely

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:05.450
waiting here for my team to retrieve me so
we can continue on our mission.”

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:12.030
The word mission amused the reprobates. “Oh
a mission?”

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:18.260
I wondered if this dwindling scrap had forgotten
it too would have once had a purpose.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:24.140
Seeing my annoyance, the largest of the vagrants,
a florid, twisted lump of metal, was good

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:30.730
enough to address me. “Ignore my brothers
and sisters, they can be very rude. Tell me,

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:32.160
how long have you been waiting?”

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.460
“I don’t know. I have lost track of my
orbits, I feel I am in freefall and I can’t

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:39.140
count the days. I do not know how long I have
been here.”

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.100
“Long enough to suspect they may not return?”

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.280
“I cannot believe that.”

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.900
“I commend your loyalty but I think you
may be making a mistake, my dear.”

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:49.900
“How so?”

00:03:49.900 --> 00:04:00.030
“Well, by the looks of you, you are defunct.
Broken. You are a shard. What the earthers

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:05.040
call ‘debris’. Have you heard of debris?”

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:12.570
“I can’t believe that’s true,” I replied.

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:20.590
“Of course. That would be terribly upsetting.
You know what I suggest? You enjoy yourself

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:26.470
a little in our company while you wait. Take
a break. It looks like your orbit will be

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:31.539
with ours a little while longer? Perhaps you
will join us in a song?”

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:36.200
“What sort of song?” I enquired, hoping
for a rousing space shanty.

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:41.840
“We can make one up,” she responded before
the calamitous carcasses began derranging

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:52.180
the air with their bad vibrations.

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:57.810
“There, don’t you feel better?”

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:05.450
I must admit, I did feel better. But still,
I was confused. I could not understand how

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:12.450
they could be so laid back, were they not
junk? I decided to enquire further:

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:15.840
“And what do you do up here, may I ask?”

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:22.340
“Oh not much, it’s a nice life, punctuated
with the odd collision. But they don’t come

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:23.470
often enough.”

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:28.139
“You want to collide?” I asked, before
my manners could hide my disgust.

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:29.740
“Oh yes!”

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:35.221
“Why would you want to collide? You’re
just creating more junk to litter the space

00:05:35.221 --> 00:05:40.240
around Earth, preventing space exploration,
communication… What’s the point?”

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:46.540
“You are a little too worried about points,
my dear. You should take a look in a reflective

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:52.410
surface some time, you’re body has enough
jagged points to satisfy you for the rest

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:53.410
of your orbital!”

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:55.730
I could sense she was making fun of me.

00:05:55.730 --> 00:06:01.250
“Oh no. I am merely suggesting that you
would do better to know yourself. And then

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:09.650
you will maybe find yourself a little… lighter.
Is it not true that your expedition abandoned

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:10.650
you?”

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:13.740
“Well yes, but they may also be in trouble.”

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:20.620
“If so, they too will be shattered around
the earth, floating in this pointless sea

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:27.300
of nothingness. Who knows, maybe you would
not even recognise them, if they were to drift

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:31.130
past, mangled and split as you are.”

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:33.290
“I am mangled and split?”

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:41.790
“It is not a bad look, actually. You see,
on earth, man sees everything as his tool.

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:47.480
He forged us to serve him, so that he may
explore space and find more ingredients and

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:53.900
tools. And then when he finds more tools,
he will use them to make more tools and then

00:06:53.900 --> 00:07:01.990
who knows? When you think about it, is our
job not so much one of littering, as of protecting?”

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:03.190
“Protecting what?”

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:08.210
“Space! The galaxy! The Universe!”

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:12.860
“From who? From man?”

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:16.240
“And woman.”

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:21.229
What hell was this that the earth had created
for itself, I wondered, and could they know

00:07:21.229 --> 00:07:28.460
down there what damaged creatures were forming
out here? The lump responded promptly to my

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:29.460
thoughts.

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:36.370
“Oh don’t worry. We will surely not have
long to enjoy ourselves. Man — and woman — will

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:43.020
soon find a way of tidying us away if that
is what you want. Expediting our journey down

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:50.110
out of orbit where, if we’re lucky we’ll
burn up in Earth’s atmosphere. And if we’re

00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:57.740
luckier…we’ll bonk someone on the head!
Either way, it won’t be long until they

00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:05.460
send up a new tool to clear you out of the
way.”

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:13.620
For the first time I noticed all the other
sad and lonely faces drifting through space.

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:20.190
Junk that had long ago given up, whose souls
had atrophied in the perpetual dark. The cloud

00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:26.131
was beginning to disperse, drumming its twisted
philosophy into space and leaving me to the

00:08:26.131 --> 00:08:28.410
empty space in my heart.

00:08:28.410 --> 00:08:33.349
“I’m afraid,” I shouted after the lump.

00:08:33.349 --> 00:08:44.779
But the lump smiled. “I hope you find your
point” she said.

00:08:44.779 --> 00:08:55.590
And I watched as this ever multiplying cloud
of anarchic debris revelled at the pulse of

00:08:55.590 --> 00:09:02.430
their own meaninglessness reverberating throughout
space.

00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:07.930
Could it be true that I am no more than the
detritus I see floating around me? Did the

00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:15.700
hand that made me, make this? Have I become
just another piece of junk littering the skies

00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:22.910
that I was made to explore? And is it possible
to find meaning in this hopeless existence,

00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:27.940
endlessly orbiting the place I once called
home?

00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:31.500
End of junk log 034. Over and out.
