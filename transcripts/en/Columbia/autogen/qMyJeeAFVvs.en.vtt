thing in the gallery and I remember that

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769
thing in the gallery and I remember that
 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.140

I know a little bit of the history of

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150
I know a little bit of the history of
 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.700
I know a little bit of the history of
this one I remember Felicity saying

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710
this one I remember Felicity saying
 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.210
this one I remember Felicity saying
something about this amazing show and I

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220
something about this amazing show and I
 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.040
something about this amazing show and I
got to see the show myself when when I

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050
got to see the show myself when when I
 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.840
got to see the show myself when when I
was over there and so I'm sort of super

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850
was over there and so I'm sort of super
 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.410
was over there and so I'm sort of super
happy that it arrived here and and it

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420
happy that it arrived here and and it
 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.710
happy that it arrived here and and it
remains of course a kind of key question

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720
remains of course a kind of key question
 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.999
remains of course a kind of key question
what it means open forum and even if

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009
what it means open forum and even if
 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.680
what it means open forum and even if
there's a contradiction in terms that

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690
there's a contradiction in terms that
 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.319
there's a contradiction in terms that
was played with Brian Henson starting

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329

more or less in the year I was born so

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760
more or less in the year I was born so
 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.200
more or less in the year I was born so
for some reason i think i have a kind of

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210
for some reason i think i have a kind of
 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.479
for some reason i think i have a kind of
tragic relationship to this concept and

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:46.489
tragic relationship to this concept and
 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:49.430
tragic relationship to this concept and
but it's a concept that moves in such an

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440
but it's a concept that moves in such an
 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.990
but it's a concept that moves in such an
interesting way from a heavy-duty

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000
interesting way from a heavy-duty
 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.880
interesting way from a heavy-duty
architectural frame to what could be

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890
architectural frame to what could be
 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.119
architectural frame to what could be
thought of as an art frame through a

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129
thought of as an art frame through a
 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.119
thought of as an art frame through a
kind of experimental film practice but

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129
kind of experimental film practice but
 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.619
kind of experimental film practice but
but all along the way none of those

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629
but all along the way none of those
 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.329
but all along the way none of those
contexts seem adequate to it like

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339
contexts seem adequate to it like
 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.899
contexts seem adequate to it like
architecture doesn't seem to fully grasp

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909
architecture doesn't seem to fully grasp
 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.899
architecture doesn't seem to fully grasp
the term and maybe it was designed to

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909
the term and maybe it was designed to
 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.760
the term and maybe it was designed to
resist architecture so it was of course

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770
resist architecture so it was of course
 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.800
resist architecture so it was of course
that it would sort of it was slip out of

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810
that it would sort of it was slip out of
 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.310
that it would sort of it was slip out of
the grasp of the architects first but I

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320
the grasp of the architects first but I
 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.100
the grasp of the architects first but I
think it also almost equally quickly

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110
think it also almost equally quickly
 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.429
think it also almost equally quickly
slides away from from art and the

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439
slides away from from art and the
 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.170
slides away from from art and the
teaching of art and it did become very

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180
teaching of art and it did become very
 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.460
teaching of art and it did become very
important in the teaching about and

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470
important in the teaching about and
 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.560
important in the teaching about and
likewise with film so it's a sort of an

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570
likewise with film so it's a sort of an
 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.300
likewise with film so it's a sort of an
elusive concept that's a very very

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310
elusive concept that's a very very
 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.749
elusive concept that's a very very
seductive so it gets picked up by people

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759
seductive so it gets picked up by people
 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.370
seductive so it gets picked up by people
and the people who pick it up are

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380
and the people who pick it up are
 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.800
and the people who pick it up are
absolutely defined by the fact that

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810
absolutely defined by the fact that
 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.200
absolutely defined by the fact that
they're not boring so a series of

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210
they're not boring so a series of
 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.359
they're not boring so a series of
extremely interesting people sort of

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369
extremely interesting people sort of
 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:45.800
extremely interesting people sort of
fall in love with this concept which

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810
fall in love with this concept which
 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.590
fall in love with this concept which
ultimately escapes them and so in a way

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600
ultimately escapes them and so in a way
 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.899
ultimately escapes them and so in a way
it holds itself through from

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909
it holds itself through from
 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.370
it holds itself through from
architecture through wire through

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380
architecture through wire through
 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.100
architecture through wire through
experimental film and beyond and and

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110
experimental film and beyond and and
 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.530
experimental film and beyond and and
therefore exists as a kind of hypothesis

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540
therefore exists as a kind of hypothesis
 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.470
therefore exists as a kind of hypothesis
about an alternative

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:01.480
 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.700
alternative practice so it's a sort of a

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710
alternative practice so it's a sort of a
 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.260
alternative practice so it's a sort of a
concept that's more interesting than

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270
concept that's more interesting than
 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.499
concept that's more interesting than
anyone who's ever picked it up and may

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509
anyone who's ever picked it up and may
 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:10.450
anyone who's ever picked it up and may
have been in a certain sense more

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:10.460
have been in a certain sense more
 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.760
have been in a certain sense more
interesting than handsome themselves and

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770
interesting than handsome themselves and
 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:18.280
interesting than handsome themselves and
I think that that no matter how

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290
I think that that no matter how
 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.110
I think that that no matter how
brilliant Hanson was I think what's

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120
brilliant Hanson was I think what's
 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.700
brilliant Hanson was I think what's
truly brilliant as always to come up

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:21.710
truly brilliant as always to come up
 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:22.630
truly brilliant as always to come up
with something that's more interesting

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640
with something that's more interesting
 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.970
with something that's more interesting
than you are and it happens all the time

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980
than you are and it happens all the time
 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.920
than you are and it happens all the time
like if you're obsessed with things like

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930
like if you're obsessed with things like
 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:28.330
like if you're obsessed with things like
I am like making the perfect coffee

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340
I am like making the perfect coffee
 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.520
I am like making the perfect coffee
there is a moment in which it happens

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530
there is a moment in which it happens
 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.220
there is a moment in which it happens
you make it but you can it's better than

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230
you make it but you can it's better than
 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:34.600
you make it but you can it's better than
you because you can never repeat it and

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610
you because you can never repeat it and
 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.820
you because you can never repeat it and
so I think concepts that are better than

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830
so I think concepts that are better than
 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.780
so I think concepts that are better than
people become better than departments

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790
people become better than departments
 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.550
people become better than departments
and better in the fields and then and

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560
and better in the fields and then and
 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.890
and better in the fields and then and
then then really become pedagogical

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900
then then really become pedagogical
 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.140
then then really become pedagogical
instruments and surely open forum is

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150
instruments and surely open forum is
 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.300
instruments and surely open forum is
exactly of that order so i think it's

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310
exactly of that order so i think it's
 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.180
exactly of that order so i think it's
potentially extraordinarily healthy for

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190
potentially extraordinarily healthy for
 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.160
potentially extraordinarily healthy for
the school to as it were bring it back

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170
the school to as it were bring it back
 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.310
the school to as it were bring it back
like bring it back through the loop and

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320
like bring it back through the loop and
 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:59.350
like bring it back through the loop and
stage again the question open forum back

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360
stage again the question open forum back
 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.260
stage again the question open forum back
in an architectural concept of course we

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:02.270
in an architectural concept of course we
 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:04.930
in an architectural concept of course we
may we may not learn the lesson as well

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940
may we may not learn the lesson as well
 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.800
may we may not learn the lesson as well
as we should because we are so fatally

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810
as we should because we are so fatally
 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.020
as we should because we are so fatally
attracted to and addicted to art and

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030
attracted to and addicted to art and
 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.150
attracted to and addicted to art and
protect in particular experiments

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160
protect in particular experiments
 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.410
protect in particular experiments
between architecture and art so i think

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420
between architecture and art so i think
 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.509
between architecture and art so i think
that this exhibition is also very

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:16.519
that this exhibition is also very
 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:18.580
that this exhibition is also very
interesting in the X in the ways in

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590
interesting in the X in the ways in
 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.720
interesting in the X in the ways in
which it continues our exploration of

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730
which it continues our exploration of
 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.370
which it continues our exploration of
the all too solid line between

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380
the all too solid line between
 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:26.229
the all too solid line between
architecture and art so I think it's

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239
architecture and art so I think it's
 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:29.229
architecture and art so I think it's
just yet another kind of healthy meal

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:29.239
just yet another kind of healthy meal
 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:32.740
just yet another kind of healthy meal

the collaboration and also the kinds of

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720
the collaboration and also the kinds of
 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.390
the collaboration and also the kinds of
questions that are coming going to come

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400
questions that are coming going to come
 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.360
questions that are coming going to come
out of this and if if this exhibition is

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370
out of this and if if this exhibition is
 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.880
out of this and if if this exhibition is
a success as I know it will be we will

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:48.890
a success as I know it will be we will
 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:50.830
a success as I know it will be we will
not be able to exhibit the same way in

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840
not be able to exhibit the same way in
 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.870
not be able to exhibit the same way in
that space again and so I think it's

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:52.880
that space again and so I think it's
 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.870
that space again and so I think it's
it's it's potentially even without

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:55.880
it's it's potentially even without
 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.030
it's it's potentially even without
knowing it going to kind of alert us to

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040
knowing it going to kind of alert us to
 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:59.970
knowing it going to kind of alert us to
things that go on in the Arthur Ross

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980
things that go on in the Arthur Ross
 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:01.870
things that go on in the Arthur Ross
gallery and as you know the arthrosis

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:01.880
gallery and as you know the arthrosis
 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.220
gallery and as you know the arthrosis
gallery has been one of the very very

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230
gallery has been one of the very very
 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:06.789
gallery has been one of the very very
central sides for the school to reflect

00:04:06.789 --> 00:04:06.799
central sides for the school to reflect
 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:08.170
central sides for the school to reflect
upon itself and its

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180
upon itself and its
 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:12.190
upon itself and its
and so on so in in their kind of classic

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.200
and so on so in in their kind of classic
 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.729
and so on so in in their kind of classic
way it is an extremely closed form the

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:15.739
way it is an extremely closed form the
 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:18.699
way it is an extremely closed form the
Ross gallery could not be more closed

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709
Ross gallery could not be more closed
 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:22.150
Ross gallery could not be more closed
the windows a shut up shut off the

building did move by the way they're

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:24.970
building did move by the way they're
 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:27.430
building did move by the way they're
just as piece of small history that the

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440
just as piece of small history that the
 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.040
just as piece of small history that the
buell building is the oldest building in

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050
buell building is the oldest building in
 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:31.900
buell building is the oldest building in
Columbia and it was not there it was

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:31.910
Columbia and it was not there it was
 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:34.540
Columbia and it was not there it was
down at what would be now more or less

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:34.550
down at what would be now more or less
 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.990
down at what would be now more or less
the bottom of the steps of low library

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000
the bottom of the steps of low library
 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.740
the bottom of the steps of low library
so actually the building itself moves so

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:41.750
so actually the building itself moves so
 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:43.420
so actually the building itself moves so
watch out even though if even if the

authorized gallery is very very a very

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:45.740
authorized gallery is very very a very
 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:47.950
authorized gallery is very very a very
precisely defined space and therefore

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:47.960
precisely defined space and therefore
 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.200
precisely defined space and therefore
it's a good space for thinking about the

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.210
it's a good space for thinking about the
 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:55.439
it's a good space for thinking about the
way open forum subverts closed spaces

00:04:55.439 --> 00:04:55.449
way open forum subverts closed spaces
 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:04:58.810

01:37:43.820 --> 01:37:43.830
obsessions with communications theory
 

01:37:43.830 --> 01:37:46.540
obsessions with communications theory
and they to the point that they enacted

agents as you showed in the film and I'm

01:37:51.830 --> 01:37:51.840
agents as you showed in the film and I'm
 

01:37:51.840 --> 01:37:53.540
agents as you showed in the film and I'm
wondering about that relationship in

01:37:53.540 --> 01:37:53.550
wondering about that relationship in
 

01:37:53.550 --> 01:37:56.950
wondering about that relationship in

something like Hansen's electronic

01:38:04.280 --> 01:38:04.290
something like Hansen's electronic
 

01:38:04.290 --> 01:38:06.170
something like Hansen's electronic
projects in the exhibition we show the

01:38:06.170 --> 01:38:06.180
projects in the exhibition we show the
 

01:38:06.180 --> 01:38:08.330
projects in the exhibition we show the
electronic music studio and you show the

01:38:08.330 --> 01:38:08.340
electronic music studio and you show the
 

01:38:08.340 --> 01:38:10.730
electronic music studio and you show the
scope your project in which there's an

01:38:10.730 --> 01:38:10.740
scope your project in which there's an
 

01:38:10.740 --> 01:38:12.970
scope your project in which there's an
idea about the building itself

01:38:12.970 --> 01:38:12.980
idea about the building itself
 

01:38:12.980 --> 01:38:16.100

01:38:16.100 --> 01:38:16.110
transforming through an electronic
 

01:38:16.110 --> 01:38:18.650
transforming through an electronic

01:38:18.650 --> 01:38:18.660
effect and this might be a lot to ask
 

01:38:18.660 --> 01:38:20.180
effect and this might be a lot to ask
but I'm just wondering if you've had if

01:38:20.180 --> 01:38:20.190
but I'm just wondering if you've had if
 

01:38:20.190 --> 01:38:22.130
but I'm just wondering if you've had if
you've thought about how what the

01:38:22.130 --> 01:38:22.140
you've thought about how what the
 

01:38:22.140 --> 01:38:24.040
you've thought about how what the
relationship is between something like

01:38:24.040 --> 01:38:24.050
relationship is between something like
 

01:38:24.050 --> 01:38:26.810
relationship is between something like
cybernetics as a paradigm for collective

01:38:30.209 --> 01:38:30.219
building as a cyber net
 

01:38:30.219 --> 01:38:31.830
building as a cyber net
mechanism and how that might work for

01:38:31.830 --> 01:38:31.840
mechanism and how that might work for
 

01:38:31.840 --> 01:38:36.270
mechanism and how that might work for
Henson's open forum no I haven't thought

01:38:36.270 --> 01:38:36.280
Henson's open forum no I haven't thought
 

01:38:36.280 --> 01:38:39.390
Henson's open forum no I haven't thought
about the precise articulation that you

01:38:39.390 --> 01:38:39.400
about the precise articulation that you
 

01:38:39.400 --> 01:38:44.069
about the precise articulation that you
suggest but suddenly I was trying to

01:38:44.069 --> 01:38:44.079
suggest but suddenly I was trying to
 

01:38:44.079 --> 01:38:45.750
suggest but suddenly I was trying to
raise the question even if somewhat

01:38:45.750 --> 01:38:45.760
raise the question even if somewhat
 

01:38:45.760 --> 01:38:49.069
raise the question even if somewhat
laterally of if we think about the

01:38:49.069 --> 01:38:49.079
laterally of if we think about the
 

01:38:49.079 --> 01:38:53.060
laterally of if we think about the
degree to which some of these ideals of

degree to which some of these ideals of
 

01:38:53.070 --> 01:38:55.770
degree to which some of these ideals of
electronic spaces you know later came to

electronic spaces you know later came to
 

01:38:55.780 --> 01:38:57.989
electronic spaces you know later came to
be understood as really haunted by

01:39:11.640 --> 01:39:11.650
I was trying it I guess at some point to
 

01:39:11.650 --> 01:39:16.620
I was trying it I guess at some point to
put a little bit of pressure on how that

01:39:16.620 --> 01:39:16.630
put a little bit of pressure on how that
 

01:39:16.630 --> 01:39:21.330
put a little bit of pressure on how that
my also be thought of in regard to their

01:39:21.330 --> 01:39:21.340
my also be thought of in regard to their
 

01:39:21.340 --> 01:39:24.120
my also be thought of in regard to their
quite utopian thinking about electronics

01:39:24.120 --> 01:39:24.130
quite utopian thinking about electronics
 

01:39:24.130 --> 01:39:27.180
quite utopian thinking about electronics
but but the work I mean 11 project that

I hope people will go and pay some

01:39:28.709 --> 01:39:28.719
I hope people will go and pay some
 

01:39:28.719 --> 01:39:30.000
I hope people will go and pay some
attention to which i think is a

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:30.010
attention to which i think is a
 

01:39:30.010 --> 01:39:33.419
attention to which i think is a
fantastic film is the project in the

01:39:33.419 --> 01:39:33.429
fantastic film is the project in the
 

01:39:33.429 --> 01:39:36.899
fantastic film is the project in the
studios at 123 yeah whether the the

01:39:36.899 --> 01:39:36.909
studios at 123 yeah whether the the
 

01:39:36.909 --> 01:39:41.339
studios at 123 yeah whether the the
artist is asking each of the camera

01:39:41.339 --> 01:39:41.349
artist is asking each of the camera
 

01:39:41.349 --> 01:39:44.009
artist is asking each of the camera
operators to shoot him in a particular

operators to shoot him in a particular
 

01:39:44.019 --> 01:39:45.509
operators to shoot him in a particular
way and he's saying you know so now we

01:39:45.509 --> 01:39:45.519
way and he's saying you know so now we
 

01:39:45.519 --> 01:39:46.919
way and he's saying you know so now we
turn to camera one yeah now we current

01:39:46.919 --> 01:39:46.929
turn to camera one yeah now we current
 

01:39:46.929 --> 01:39:49.799
turn to camera one yeah now we current
camera two and and and this is a film

01:39:49.799 --> 01:39:49.809
camera two and and and this is a film
 

01:39:49.809 --> 01:39:51.870
camera two and and and this is a film
that was shown on television actually

01:39:51.870 --> 01:39:51.880
that was shown on television actually
 

01:39:51.880 --> 01:39:53.790

come back to Chrissy's suggestion and

01:39:53.790 --> 01:39:53.800
come back to Chrissy's suggestion and
 

01:39:53.800 --> 01:39:56.939
come back to Chrissy's suggestion and
it's a film that in effect shows the or

01:39:56.939 --> 01:39:56.949
it's a film that in effect shows the or
 

01:39:56.949 --> 01:40:00.750
it's a film that in effect shows the or
or reveals the constructive nature of

01:40:00.750 --> 01:40:00.760
or reveals the constructive nature of
 

01:40:00.760 --> 01:40:03.120
or reveals the constructive nature of
the image yeah for the television

01:40:03.120 --> 01:40:03.130
the image yeah for the television
 

01:40:03.130 --> 01:40:05.310
the image yeah for the television
audience and I think that but also a

01:40:05.310 --> 01:40:05.320
audience and I think that but also a
 

01:40:05.320 --> 01:40:09.299
audience and I think that but also a
number of the other films had a similar

01:40:09.299 --> 01:40:09.309
number of the other films had a similar
 

01:40:09.309 --> 01:40:10.830

01:40:10.830 --> 01:40:10.840
I know this doesn't speak exactly to
 

01:40:10.840 --> 01:40:12.959
I know this doesn't speak exactly to
what you're asking but there was a sense

01:40:12.959 --> 01:40:12.969
what you're asking but there was a sense
 

01:40:12.969 --> 01:40:14.969
what you're asking but there was a sense
of a sort of incredibles of

01:40:14.969 --> 01:40:14.979
of a sort of incredibles of
 

01:40:14.979 --> 01:40:18.270
of a sort of incredibles of
consciousness and attention to exactly

how this media image was being

lacking and something like this coffee

01:40:25.959 --> 01:40:25.969
lacking and something like this coffee
 

01:40:25.969 --> 01:40:29.109

project and I yes so so to that degree i

01:40:29.109 --> 01:40:29.119
project and I yes so so to that degree i
 

01:40:29.119 --> 01:40:32.919

think the you know not only does this

01:40:32.919 --> 01:40:32.929
think the you know not only does this
 

01:40:32.929 --> 01:40:36.159
think the you know not only does this
sort of dialogue go both ways but the

01:40:36.159 --> 01:40:36.169
sort of dialogue go both ways but the
 

01:40:36.169 --> 01:40:37.330
sort of dialogue go both ways but the
sort of lessons the sort of

01:40:37.330 --> 01:40:37.340
sort of lessons the sort of
 

01:40:37.340 --> 01:40:39.209
sort of lessons the sort of
attentiveness that the architects might

01:40:39.209 --> 01:40:39.219
attentiveness that the architects might
 

01:40:39.219 --> 01:40:41.739
attentiveness that the architects might
might take back from the artist and the

01:40:41.739 --> 01:40:41.749
might take back from the artist and the
 

01:40:41.749 --> 01:40:44.620
might take back from the artist and the
way they deploy the the concept of open

01:40:44.620 --> 01:40:44.630
way they deploy the the concept of open
 

01:40:44.630 --> 01:40:48.399
way they deploy the the concept of open
forum and and and sort of translated it

01:40:48.399 --> 01:40:48.409
forum and and and sort of translated it
 

01:40:48.409 --> 01:40:50.919

into a different set of tactic may

01:40:50.919 --> 01:40:50.929
into a different set of tactic may

indeed sort of need to fold back further

01:40:52.600 --> 01:40:52.610
indeed sort of need to fold back further

those that's very helpful um I'm going

01:41:04.659 --> 01:41:04.669
those that's very helpful um I'm going
 

01:41:04.669 --> 01:41:06.939
those that's very helpful um I'm going
to ask one cash one last question before

01:41:06.939 --> 01:41:06.949
to ask one cash one last question before
 

01:41:06.949 --> 01:41:09.549
to ask one cash one last question before
we head over to me it's a slightly

01:41:09.549 --> 01:41:09.559
we head over to me it's a slightly
 

01:41:09.559 --> 01:41:11.469
we head over to me it's a slightly
related question which is that if the

your phrase that the artists were trying

01:41:21.520 --> 01:41:21.530
your phrase that the artists were trying
 

01:41:21.530 --> 01:41:23.830
your phrase that the artists were trying
to accelerate the revolution seems you

01:41:23.830 --> 01:41:23.840
to accelerate the revolution seems you
 

01:41:23.840 --> 01:41:26.020
to accelerate the revolution seems you
know an incredibly compelling way to

01:41:26.020 --> 01:41:26.030
know an incredibly compelling way to
 

01:41:26.030 --> 01:41:28.060
know an incredibly compelling way to
describe the activity but of course that

01:41:28.060 --> 01:41:28.070
describe the activity but of course that
 

01:41:28.070 --> 01:41:29.649
describe the activity but of course that
begs the question of what kind of

01:41:29.649 --> 01:41:29.659
begs the question of what kind of
 

01:41:29.659 --> 01:41:30.909
begs the question of what kind of
revolution they were trying to

01:41:30.909 --> 01:41:30.919
revolution they were trying to
 

01:41:30.919 --> 01:41:34.330
revolution they were trying to
accelerate and and and when you think

01:41:34.330 --> 01:41:34.340
accelerate and and and when you think
 

01:41:34.340 --> 01:41:38.169
accelerate and and and when you think
about the type of revolutionary

01:41:38.169 --> 01:41:38.179
about the type of revolutionary
 

01:41:38.179 --> 01:41:40.029
about the type of revolutionary
practices that Chrissy was describing

01:41:40.029 --> 01:41:40.039
practices that Chrissy was describing
 

01:41:40.039 --> 01:41:41.919
practices that Chrissy was describing
which are revolutionary in terms of

01:41:41.919 --> 01:41:41.929
which are revolutionary in terms of
 

01:41:41.929 --> 01:41:43.330
which are revolutionary in terms of
their application of new media

01:41:43.330 --> 01:41:43.340
their application of new media
 

01:41:43.340 --> 01:41:45.399
their application of new media
technologies revolutionary and if we're

01:41:45.399 --> 01:41:45.409
technologies revolutionary and if we're
 

01:41:45.409 --> 01:41:46.810
