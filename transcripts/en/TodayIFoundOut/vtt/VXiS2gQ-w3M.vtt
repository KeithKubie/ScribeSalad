00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.460
Hello I’m Simon Whistler, you’re watching
the Today I Found Out YouTube channel, and

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:07.240
in the video today if you’ve ever wondered
how deaf people think, in terms of their inner

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:12.969
voice, well, you’re not going to wonder
for much longer.

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:17.610
Those who were born completely deaf and only
learned sign language will, not surprisingly,

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:19.160
think in sign language.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.340
What is surprising is those who were born
completely deaf but learn to speak through

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.150
vocal training will occasionally think not
only in the particular sign language that

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:33.180
they know, but also will sometimes think in
the vocal language they learned, with their

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.149
brains coming up with how the vocal language
sounds.

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.769
Primarily though, most completely deaf people
think in sign language.

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:44.489
Similar to how an "inner voice" of a hearing
person is experienced in one's own voice,

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.550
a completely deaf person sees or, more aptly,
feels themselves signing in their head as

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:50.550
they "talk" in their heads.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.749
For those deaf people who are not completely
deaf or wear devices to allow them to hear

00:00:54.749 --> 00:00:59.320
somewhat, they will often experience more
vocal language in their "inner voice" in proportion

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.600
to how much they can hear.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.800
Interestingly, deafness is significantly more
serious than blindness in terms of the effect

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.010
it can have on the brain.

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.080
This isn't because deaf people's brains are
different than hearing people, in terms of

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.580
mental capacity or the like; rather, it is
because of how integral language is to how

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:16.640
our brain functions.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:23.000
To be clear, "language" here not only refers
to spoken languages, but also to sign language.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.840
It is simply important that the brain have
some form of complex language it can fully

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.510
comprehend and can turn into an inner voice
to drive thought.

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:36.200
More specifically, language is integral in
such brain functions as memory, abstract thinking,

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.570
and, fascinatingly, self-awareness.

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:43.590
Language has been shown to literally be the
"device driver", so to speak, that drives

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.680
much of the brain's core "hardware".

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.450
Thus, deaf people who aren't identified as
such very young or that live in places where

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.750
they aren't able to be taught sign language,
will usually be significantly handicapped

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.680
mentally until they learn a structured language,
even though there is nothing actually wrong

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.200
with their brains.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.480
The problem is even more severe than it may
appear at first because of how important language

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:09.280
is to the early stages of development of the
brain.

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.060
Those completely deaf people who are taught
no sign language until later life will often

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.030
have learning problems that stick with them
throughout their lives, even after they have

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.510
eventually learned a particular sign language.

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.980
It is because of how integral language is
to how our brains develop and function that

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.760
deaf people were long thought of as inherently
mentally handicapped and unteachable.

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.621
In fact, until around the 1970s, it was still
widely thought that the majority of deaf people

00:02:34.621 --> 00:02:37.650
were at least mildly mentally handicapped.

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.480
How could this be when they had various sign
languages and even vocal training to allow

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.100
their brains to develop and function properly?

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.040
The problem stemmed from the fact that it
was decided at the International Congress

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:54.370
on Education of the Deaf that took place in
1880 in Milan that deaf people should not

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:59.400
use sign language; rather, they should be
forced to use spoken language almost exclusively.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.900
This seems reasonable enough on the surface,
as deaf people are fully capable of learning

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.540
spoken language and this would allow them
to more completely integrate into the hearing

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.790
world, which is what spurred these educators
to make this momentous decision.

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.630
The problem with this was only recently discovered
and, indeed, many of the negative implications

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.870
are only just now being understood.

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:25.600
It turns out, while there are certainly exceptions,
most completely deaf people who are forced

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:31.380
to use only spoken language are only slightly
better off than those who know no language,

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.540
in terms of the development of certain brain
functions.

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.459
The first research showing the failure of
the oral method was done by Cambridge Professor

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:45.300
Ruban Conrad in the 1970s via testing reading
ability in deaf teenagers trained in said

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:46.300
method.

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:51.099
He discovered that while the average fully
deaf teenager could read individual words

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:55.420
at about an eight year old level, they read
without much understanding, particularly when

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.550
it came to taking in the meaning of a full
sentence.

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:02.751
The problem was that they had not adequately
been able to develop an "inner voice" due

00:04:02.751 --> 00:04:06.470
to being restricted to oral language which
they could not hear.

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:11.330
Thus, without the inner voice, there was no
auditory imagery to linger in short term memory

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:13.400
while they took in the whole sentence.

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:18.169
In the general case, the fully deaf taught
only the oral method do gain significantly

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:23.070
more sense of self and better memory and the
like over those who have no language at all,

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:27.750
but in this state, they will never fully reach
their brain's potential as in when they learn

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:28.880
sign language.

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.620
The leading theory behind why those completely
deaf people taught only vocal language don't

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:38.000
properly develop an "inner voice" is that,
without being able to associate sounds with

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.850
the phonemes and complete words, the language
is too abstract and a brain without language

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:45.460
already struggles with things that are abstract.

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:50.240
Those deaf people who learn sign language,
however, have less trouble with comprehending

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:54.990
vocal language and, as noted earlier, have
the ability to have an "inner voice" that

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.990
speaks.

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:59.710
This is thought to be because, once the brain
has a structured language from which to more

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:04.960
or less "run" off of, similar to a computer’s
operating system, abstract concepts can be

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:10.580
more easily grasped; thus, comprehending vocal
language sounds and text becomes significantly

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:11.590
easier.

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:15.590
Because of these findings, the "oralist" method
of teaching the deaf that had endured for

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:21.991
just under a century began being rapidly phased
out in favor of a "bilingual" education where

00:05:21.991 --> 00:05:26.600
sign language is taught as early as possible
and vocal language is taught as a sort of

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:28.060
secondary language.

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:33.010
As noted by Miranda Pickersgill, chief of
deaf services for Leeds Local Education Authority,

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:35.460
"Bilingualism is still very much a hot potato.

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:40.650
We have come in for a lot of flak and been
accused of pushing deaf children into a signing

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:41.650
ghetto.

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:45.150
Yet the deaf had a big price to pay when the
old methods failed.

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:48.580
Not only could they not communicate, but they
were left without a code to think in.

00:05:48.580 --> 00:06:03.080
We can no longer ignore what the research
tells us."
