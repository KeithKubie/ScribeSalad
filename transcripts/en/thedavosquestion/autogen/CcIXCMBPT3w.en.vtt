&gt;&gt;Hi this is a conversation with the YouTube
community. Hi everyone. My name is Akin Adesina

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:11.710
and I'm vice president for The Alliance For
A Green Revolution in Africa. Very tough question,

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:15.790
but I think the thing that we first have to
realize is that the world belongs to all of

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:21.100
us and we're actually inheriting it for the
future generation, and therefore we are living

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.940
on borrowed time. We have to leave a better
world for the future generations. What can

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:31.151
we do? I think we all have to be responsible
citizens, as governments, as society, as individual,

00:00:31.151 --> 00:00:35.540
as corporations and the way that we do are
business is a (inaudible) our resources in

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.870
our communities. And clearly you can't do
that alone but we all have to work together.

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.020
So the key word is partnership. Work together
to make the world a better place for all,

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.760
and especially for our children in the future.
Bye
