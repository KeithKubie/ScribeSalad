00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.759
I first went to Bell Labs, I think in 1967. 

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:09.210
I was. at the time, a graduate student in
computer science - except it was

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.500
before computer science. It was electrical
engineering

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.780
at Princeton and I was lucky enough to get

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.060
a summer job at Bell Labs. But it was a
wonderful place because there were an enormous

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:21.449
number of really good people,

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.640
doing really interesting things, and
nobody telling you what to do -

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:30.189
a kinda rewarding environment! And
so it was so good that when I graduated

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:34.640
from Princeton I didn't even interview
any other place I just said "OK

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.969
I'll go to Bell Labs. they offered me a job,
why not do it ?"  

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:41.989
And that was a decision that was extremely
lucky and I've never regretted it.

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:46.629
In one single large-ish building there
were probably four thousand people of whom

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:49.980
about 2,000 were probably PhD's in
various forms of

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.750
science: physics, chemistry, materials and then

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.079
on the - call it the "softer" end -
mathematics and

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:00.680
the relatively new field of computer
science at that point.

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.900
A large number of really, really excellent
people, and the environment was

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.920
"You can do anything you want" because

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.990
the revenue source for Bell Labs.
with very stable. It was part of AT&amp;T

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.430
which, in effect, provided telephone
service for the whole country

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:20.140
and the way it did it ...  At that time AT&amp;T 
was a regulated monopoly which meant they

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.540
had in effect a guaranteed rate of return

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.420
and they peeled a tiny piece of that off for

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.659
research to improve telephone service in
the country. That was the quid pro quo.

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.110
And because of that there was no shortage of

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.890
resources and no management direction that
said "You have to do something that will

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.960
save the company in the next quarter".
That was really

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.810
very satisfying and so most people worked
on things that were in some way

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:47.820
long-term

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.460
or, at least, whose immediate application
wasn't obvious. Hard to beat that

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:53.950
environment I think.

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.380
And I think I was there for over 30
years and I was never once told what I

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:58.270
should be working

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.060
on . And the way it worked was, at the and 
of each year

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.270
you had to write down on one side, of one
piece of paper, what you had done

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.560
during the year and they used that to
determine how much they'd pay you next year.

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.340
I was born in Toronto -

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.370
as almost everybody in Canada seems
to be and

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.480
I went to University at

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.360
University of Toronto and I was there
from '60 to '64

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.129
and then not knowing what to do, in the
best tradition, and not wanting to look

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:27.980
for a job, I went to graduate school

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.230
and so I wound up at Princeton, I think
largely because they made me

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.239
on the surface, and in retrospect really,

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:38.269
a better offer than some of the other
places that I had also applied to.

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:42.120
And that was a very good thing. I
actually enjoyed that and I met a lot of

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.170
good people and by pure luck

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:49.709
I landed this job at Bell Labs. The reason 
I landed the job there, I think, is that

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.989
the year before I had worked at MIT on
Project Mac, which was the very first

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:57.459
real .... It was the beginning of the 
MULTICS era

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:00.980
and they were using something called
CTSS - the Compatible Time-Sharing System

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.489
which was really the first time-sharing

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:06.680
system up. And so I had a good time 
that summer

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.980
and I met, indirectly, virtually all the 
people from Bell Labs. and so I

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.040
got lucky and got a job for a couple
of summers and that paid off

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.340
both in future contacts but also in giving me

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.310
something to do for my thesis. The original
computing world

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.810
- original? -  a long time ago, certainly when
I was an undergraduate, was that there

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:26.970
were big computers

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.269
sitting in rooms - air-conditioned rooms -
behind counters, looked after by operators.

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:34.349
And if you wanted to get something done
what you had to do

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:38.049
was take - usually a deck of cards - although
perhaps paper tape,

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:41.480
hand it to  an operator, and a long
time later

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.440
you would get your results, which of course
would be "It didn't work" and so you'd repeat it.

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.590
And so the idea of time-sharing was
to say let's make it so that here's this

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.049
computer, sitting there,

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:54.459
and, instead of feeding it cards by an
operator, let's connect

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:58.120
terminals to it. And these were mostly, at
that time, mechanical terminals,

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.139
like teletypes, not even VDT terminals.

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:04.620
And connect those and have the 
operating system

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.989
of the computer sort of give you a few
seconds, or

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:11.109
half a second, of time and give him a
half, and give her

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:14.519
a little bit. And just going round and round
the people who wanted

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:18.690
to do some kind of computing. Because
computers were, even then, much faster than

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:20.859
people, this actually gave everybody the

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:25.020
illusion that they had the whole computer to
themselves. So it was unbelievably

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:26.300
liberating. You could

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.509
type some stuff into a file

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:32.819
and it would remember it for you -  no 
punch-cards! And then you could say "Gee!

00:04:32.819 --> 00:04:36.860
let me compile that file". And it would 
do that,

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:40.569
and a few seconds later the compilation would
be over. And no waiting for an operator

00:04:40.569 --> 00:04:41.169
to give you

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:44.389
a piece of paper that said your compilation
failed: you found it right away. So then

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:45.430
you made a change

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:51.310
and did it again and so it was incredibly
more productive. You could do in a few

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.779
minutes something that might have taken
you a few days with the punch card

00:04:54.779 --> 00:04:58.180
paper, operator, kind of mechanisms. That's
what time-sharing was,

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:02.319
if you like. So could you call that an
early version of Cloud Computing?

00:05:02.319 --> 00:05:06.039
Perhaps you could. There's a central
computer it has the resources that were

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:07.520
information is being stored

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:11.449
and you're talking to it remotely. Maybe
not very remotely

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:16.189
but, given phone systems, it could be
really remotely. So in an early sense

00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:19.469
you could say that was cloud computing.
&gt;&gt; SEAN: You've come round full-circle in some respects?

00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:22.659
&gt;&gt; BWK: In some respects absolutely. The connection

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:26.960
was that MIT had done this system called CTSS

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.440
- very successful but of course very local - and

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:34.089
they decided that they wanted to do the
next thing which was

00:05:34.089 --> 00:05:38.069
a computing utility which would provide
that same sort of wonderful service

00:05:38.069 --> 00:05:42.969
to the world at large. Let's build a computing 
utility and to do that we need more

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:46.159
resources of time, money and especially people.

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:51.659
And so MIT enlisted two other
organizations to help them build this

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:55.520
thing, which was going to be called MULTICS - 
the Multiplexed Information and Computing Service.

00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:00.509
One of those was General Electric which, at
the time made computer hardware -

00:06:00.509 --> 00:06:03.979
seem strange - and the other was Bell Labs.

00:06:03.979 --> 00:06:07.560
which had, at the time, a lot of
experience in operating system development

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:10.000
because they had built operating systems for

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.599
IBM computers, that were not IBM. And so

00:06:13.599 --> 00:06:16.669
we had these three organizations MIT, GE

00:06:16.669 --> 00:06:20.889
and Bell Labs, in three different places. One
was in Cambridge, Massachusetts one was in

00:06:21.439 --> 00:06:25.930
Murray Hill, New Jersey and one was in
Phoenix, Arizona. You don't have to study

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:29.100
management theory very much to realize the
potential problems in

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:33.030
this sort of thing. So they worked on
MULTICS for probably three or four

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:37.360
years and at that point Bell Labs.
decided that it wasn't going

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:41.210
where it should go, fast enough. And they
withdrew from the project.

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:45.070
That was in late '68 - very early '69.

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:50.560
But up to that point people from Bell
Labs who had been involved in MULTICS were

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:55.560
had, y' know, really gotten used to time-sharing, 
understood that it worked really well

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:59.430
and had learned a lot of things about
how you develop operating systems, were

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:03.390
using high-level languages to do the
actual implementation of the operating

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:05.080
systems. They got a tremendous amount

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:09.190
of experience and a taste for really
good computing

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:12.560
and so when Bell Labs. pulled out it left people,

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:16.420
in particular Ken Thompson and Dennis
Ritchie, with a big hole:

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:19.870
"We'd like to do things this way but we can't
do it, what do we do?"

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:23.730
And then you go off to this well-told
story of Ken Thompson finding a

00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:26.910
little-used PDP-7 upon which he built, in
a month,

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:30.450
an operating system. And the rest is UNIX
history.

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:35.570
At the time I was at MIT, which was
the summer of '66, I did not know Ken

00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:40.530
at all. I met him, I think, then when I've
spent the summer of '67

00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:44.450
at Bell Labs. and we were in the same organization

00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:49.490
and I think Dennis arrived more or less at the
same time. I don't have clear memories of

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:50.100
that, and then

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:56.370
I went there permanently in the uh ... very
early in 1969, and we were all in the same

00:07:56.370 --> 00:07:59.139
organization and so at that point I got
to know

00:07:59.139 --> 00:08:03.439
them well ... still friends. Dennis unfortunately
died several years ago,

00:08:03.439 --> 00:08:07.529
but I keep in touch with Ken at least sporadically. 

00:08:07.529 --> 00:08:11.050
&gt;&gt; SEAN: that must have been quite something!
Summer of '69, you're there at Bell Labs.

00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:16.719
What was the feeling there? Was it like working at one 
of these place that are so well-known for their innovation ...

00:08:16.719 --> 00:08:21.529
&gt;&gt; BWK: Yes, it was an indescribably great
experience - it really was - because there

00:08:21.529 --> 00:08:22.840
were so many people there

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:26.159
who were so good, and the environment was
totally open

00:08:26.159 --> 00:08:29.499
and supportive. If you had a problem - it was

00:08:29.499 --> 00:08:33.019
y'know, like the corridors of the building.
Everybody's office door was open. You

00:08:33.019 --> 00:08:34.870
could say "I have a problem"

00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:38.370
to anybody and they would try and help
you. They would drop whatever they were doing

00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:41.640
and if somebody came into your office
you could, y' know,

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:44.420
try and help them with their problems.
If somebody had an idea they would talk

00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:47.640
about it; people would gather in the
corners talking about ideas,

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:51.709
people would meet at lunch and talk about things
like that. Everything was totally open.

00:08:51.709 --> 00:08:55.250
Certainly in the UNIX system, although they were
protections on files

00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:58.910
in the file-system, people tended not to
use them. And certainly the source code

00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:01.260
for the system was just sitting there
and you could

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:04.680
look at it. People had logins but

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:08.540
typically kept their directories totally
open. It was probably foolishly open in

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:10.269
some respects but ...

00:09:10.269 --> 00:09:13.370
So if you wanted to see how a command worked

00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:16.380
you could read the code. If you wanted to
change it - well go ahead and do it

00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:19.640
And so, in that sense,

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:23.640
it was, within a narrower environment, a
precursor of

00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:28.870
open source and, in the jargon of a few
years later, was 

00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:29.490
"Ego-less programming"

00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:32.520
in the sense that "I wrote the code but if
somebody else can do it better - go ahead"

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:37.380
I think typically that didn't happen a lot,
except by people who were working

00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:41.839
together. So no way would I go in and
change Ken's implementation something in

00:09:41.839 --> 00:09:42.279
the kernel.

00:09:42.279 --> 00:09:45.670
No - not me! But

00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:48.810
I remember going in and changing 
some stuff, adding

00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:53.149
a sub-command to the the editor, 'ed',
at one point, just because there was

00:09:53.149 --> 00:09:55.570
something I thought I could do better
that would be useful.

00:09:55.570 --> 00:09:59.060
So, that kind of thing happened all the time.
So it was

00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:02.250
a very very free, open

00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:06.630
and incredibly ... wonderful experience

00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:11.029
because you weren't told what to do, you
were just ... go do something.

00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:22.690
I think part of it was the
environment - the environment was so

00:10:22.690 --> 00:10:25.480
stimulating and there were so many
interesting things to work on.

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:28.779
I think in the background  ... AT&amp;T remember
was providing

00:10:28.779 --> 00:10:32.580
a telephone service for the whole country.
AT&amp;T had well over a million employees

00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:33.940
it was the biggest employer outside

00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:39.060
the government at that time. And that meant
that it was a problem-rich environment

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:39.579
there were just

00:10:39.579 --> 00:10:42.640
all kinds of things that you could work
on. And so

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:46.089
although there was nobody telling you
what to work on,

00:10:46.089 --> 00:10:48.740
there was always, in the background, this
idea that "Gee! there's something

00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:50.620
interesting there, we could do something

00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:53.839
with that". And I think a lot of people, and

00:10:53.839 --> 00:10:57.360
certainly for me, you would work on
something that had nothing obvious

00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:58.620
immediately to do with

00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:01.579
communications and then maybe you'd work
for a little while on something that did

00:11:01.579 --> 00:11:04.209
have something, and you'd kinda cycle back
and forth

00:11:04.209 --> 00:11:08.350
among these. Other people stayed fairly pure
on one side

00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:12.089
of, y'know, "Let me ... let's do
mathematical type research"

00:11:12.089 --> 00:11:15.950
and others were fairly hard-core "Let's
do something that's

00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:19.430
directly related to the telephone
business" - all the time.

00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:24.899
But remember the research part although it was
- call it 1500 to 2000 people - was actually a tiny,

00:11:24.899 --> 00:11:29.509
tiny fraction of the whole company. So in
some sense it didn't matter as long as

00:11:29.509 --> 00:11:32.329
this collection of people produced things
that were useful.

00:11:32.329 --> 00:11:36.180
And they had produced, over the years,
things that were useful. The transistor comes

00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:38.819
to mind as just something that was useful.

00:11:38.819 --> 00:11:42.240
And some of the early work on lasers was

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:47.699
done at Bell Labs. Zone refining
which makes semiconductors actually

00:11:47.699 --> 00:11:51.329
practical - all of these things came out

00:11:51.329 --> 00:11:55.139
of Bell Labs. And, of course, lots of interesting
things in communications as

00:11:55.139 --> 00:12:00.740
well. So, given an environment like that -
and where everybody is better than you are -

00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:03.899
you don't slack. You try and keep up with
them ....

00:12:03.899 --> 00:12:09.279
I never succeeded but it was a lot of fun!
