00:00:00.464 --> 00:00:03.088
- [Voiceover] In chemistry,
there's a very valuable concept

00:00:03.088 --> 00:00:06.966
called Specific Heat, and
specific heat is particular

00:00:06.966 --> 00:00:08.289
to a given substance.

00:00:08.289 --> 00:00:10.820
Every substance has a
different specific heat.

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:13.792
It's defined as the amount of heat,

00:00:13.792 --> 00:00:16.044
the amount of heat energy needed

00:00:16.044 --> 00:00:20.177
to raise one gram of a
substance one degree celsius.

00:00:20.177 --> 00:00:21.454
Sometimes the definition might say

00:00:21.454 --> 00:00:24.705
to raise a given mass of a
substance one degree celsius,

00:00:24.705 --> 00:00:27.259
but I'm just being a
little bit more particular.

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:31.113
One gram of a substance,
one degree celsius.

00:00:31.113 --> 00:00:32.669
So this is telling us,
well how much energy

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.153
do I have to put into
something to heat it up?

00:00:35.153 --> 00:00:36.500
So, for example.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.472
For example, water, water.

00:00:39.472 --> 00:00:41.748
If I wanna raise that one degree celsius,

00:00:41.748 --> 00:00:45.648
so if I wanna raise
that one degree celsius,

00:00:45.648 --> 00:00:47.320
I would have to put in,

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.432
I would have to put in
a certain amount of,

00:00:50.432 --> 00:00:52.312
I would have to put in a
certain amount of heat,

00:00:52.312 --> 00:00:55.470
which would be different
than, say if I had sand.

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:59.110
Let's say this is, let's say this is sand.

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:00.694
This is sand.

00:01:00.694 --> 00:01:02.389
I have trouble picking colors.

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:04.665
So this is sand right over here.

00:01:04.665 --> 00:01:06.499
I have to do a better job of drawing sand.

00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:08.589
So this is sand right over here.

00:01:08.589 --> 00:01:11.421
If I wanna raise that one degree celsius,

00:01:12.203 --> 00:01:13.216
I would need a different amount.

00:01:13.216 --> 00:01:15.515
It actually turns out
that I need less heat,

00:01:15.515 --> 00:01:18.394
I need less heat to raise
the sand one degree celsius

00:01:18.394 --> 00:01:21.853
than I need to raise the
temperature of the water

00:01:21.853 --> 00:01:24.802
or one gram of the water
one degree celsius.

00:01:24.802 --> 00:01:26.033
So let's say this is a gram of water

00:01:26.033 --> 00:01:27.240
and this is a gram of sand.

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.400
I'm going to need more heat here

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.704
to raise this one degree
celsius than to raise that.

00:01:32.704 --> 00:01:35.335
That's because water has
a higher specific heat.

00:01:35.335 --> 00:01:37.163
So higher,

00:01:37.471 --> 00:01:40.573
higher, relatively higher specific heat.

00:01:40.573 --> 00:01:43.308
Specific heat.

00:01:43.684 --> 00:01:45.728
And sand, or at least relative to water,

00:01:45.728 --> 00:01:47.626
has a lower specific heat.

00:01:47.817 --> 00:01:49.837
Lower specific heat.

00:01:49.837 --> 00:01:51.277
So two ways you could think about it.

00:01:51.617 --> 00:01:52.777
Let me write this.

00:01:52.777 --> 00:01:54.077
Lower,

00:01:54.077 --> 00:01:56.684
lower specific,

00:01:56.684 --> 00:01:59.238
specific heat.

00:01:59.238 --> 00:02:00.283
Two ways to think about it.

00:02:00.283 --> 00:02:02.187
If you wanna raise one
gram of each of them

00:02:02.187 --> 00:02:05.124
one degree celsius, you're
gonna have to put more energy

00:02:05.124 --> 00:02:07.008
into the water than you're going to have

00:02:07.008 --> 00:02:08.308
to put into the sand.

00:02:08.308 --> 00:02:10.143
Or the other way around,
if you put the same amount

00:02:10.143 --> 00:02:12.697
of energy into both, you're
gonna raise the temperature

00:02:12.697 --> 00:02:15.785
of the sand a lot more than
you would raise the temperature

00:02:15.785 --> 00:02:17.201
of the water.

00:02:17.201 --> 00:02:20.359
And water, actually, its
specific heat has a special name

00:02:20.359 --> 00:02:22.008
and this is a name that
you have seen before.

00:02:22.008 --> 00:02:24.817
The specific heat of water
is called the calorie.

00:02:24.817 --> 00:02:26.212
Specific,

00:02:27.286 --> 00:02:30.453
specific heat

00:02:30.453 --> 00:02:32.324
of water

00:02:32.324 --> 00:02:34.605
is called the calorie.

00:02:34.605 --> 00:02:36.184
And you have seen this word before.

00:02:36.184 --> 00:02:38.251
When you've wanted to cut calories,

00:02:38.251 --> 00:02:39.319
when you've looked at the back

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:42.059
of nutritional labels on food.

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:43.405
There's one clarification.

00:02:43.405 --> 00:02:44.729
The calorie that people talk about

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:46.067
when they're talking
about nutritional labels

00:02:46.067 --> 00:02:48.087
or how many calories are actually in food,

00:02:48.087 --> 00:02:49.921
that's actually kilocalories.

00:02:49.921 --> 00:02:52.684
So if you see, if someone hands you

00:02:52.684 --> 00:02:54.983
a, let's say a bowl of ice cream.

00:02:54.983 --> 00:02:56.841
Let me draw a bowl of ice cream here.

00:02:56.841 --> 00:02:59.975
So if someone hands you a bowl
of ice cream right over here

00:02:59.975 --> 00:03:03.313
and they tell you that
this is 500 calories.

00:03:03.551 --> 00:03:04.665
Let me write that down.

00:03:04.665 --> 00:03:07.864
This is 500 calories.

00:03:07.864 --> 00:03:10.627
If we're thinking of it
in terms of specific heat,

00:03:10.627 --> 00:03:13.181
it's actually 500 kilocalories.

00:03:13.181 --> 00:03:17.146
500 kilocalories.

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:18.367
So there's a couple of ways

00:03:18.367 --> 00:03:20.805
that you could think
about 500 kilocalories.

00:03:20.805 --> 00:03:22.709
You could think about it as,

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:27.379
this is, this ice cream
has enough energy to raise,

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:32.157
to raise 500 kilograms

00:03:32.157 --> 00:03:34.499
of water

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.282
one degree celsius.

00:03:37.282 --> 00:03:40.487
You could also view it as the amount,

00:03:40.487 --> 00:03:41.555
well actually if you wanna think of it

00:03:41.555 --> 00:03:45.432
in more human terms, most
humans are roughly grown people

00:03:45.432 --> 00:03:46.965
are between 50 kilograms

00:03:46.965 --> 00:03:49.078
or 60, 70 kilograms roughly over there.

00:03:49.078 --> 00:03:51.051
You could say 50 kilograms of water.

00:03:51.051 --> 00:03:52.444
Actually a grown male might be composed

00:03:52.444 --> 00:03:54.047
of about 50 kilograms of water

00:03:54.047 --> 00:03:55.138
and then there's obviously other things

00:03:55.138 --> 00:03:57.553
that make up their weight,
I'm just approximating.

00:03:57.553 --> 00:04:01.407
50 kilograms of water

00:04:02.276 --> 00:04:03.730
and then we're raising
it one degree celsius

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.375
in the top case, but in this
case you would raise it 10.

00:04:07.375 --> 00:04:10.185
You would raise it 10 degrees celsius.

00:04:10.185 --> 00:04:11.625
And that's actually happening in our body.

00:04:11.625 --> 00:04:14.132
Your body heat is actually
caused, partially,

00:04:14.132 --> 00:04:17.197
the energy from food, some of
it is to process your movement

00:04:17.197 --> 00:04:19.519
and the different functions
of your muscles and the brain

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:20.537
and all the things you body does,

00:04:20.537 --> 00:04:23.323
and some of it is just producing heat.

00:04:23.323 --> 00:04:24.763
Sometimes as a byproduct of that movement

00:04:24.763 --> 00:04:27.781
and sometimes, frankly, just
for the sake of producing heat.

00:04:27.781 --> 00:04:31.264
So, 500 calories you see on a food label,

00:04:31.264 --> 00:04:32.936
that's really 500 kilocalories,

00:04:32.936 --> 00:04:35.249
and that's enough energy

00:04:35.249 --> 00:04:38.676
to raise 500,000 grams of water,

00:04:38.676 --> 00:04:41.927
remember 500 kilograms,
500,000 grams of water,

00:04:41.927 --> 00:04:43.343
one degree celsius,

00:04:43.343 --> 00:04:47.522
or 50,000 grams of water
10 degrees celsius.

00:04:47.522 --> 00:04:50.541
But anyway, water has a
special name, it's calorie.

00:04:50.541 --> 00:04:51.795
It's neat to be able to connect it to,

00:04:51.795 --> 00:04:53.211
well, what we're eating and to think

00:04:53.211 --> 00:04:54.790
about what a calorie actually means,

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:56.346
or what kilocalorie actually means.

00:04:56.346 --> 00:04:58.807
But this notion that water

00:04:58.807 --> 00:05:01.430
has a higher relative specific heat

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:04.031
to, say, things like land,
actually has huge impacts

00:05:04.031 --> 00:05:04.937
on our climate.

00:05:04.937 --> 00:05:06.980
It's actually one of the
reasons why it's often nice

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:08.953
to live near the coast.

00:05:08.953 --> 00:05:13.110
Because, let me draw,
let me draw a coastline.

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:14.433
Right over here.

00:05:15.213 --> 00:05:17.698
This is, actually I'll draw it from,

00:05:17.698 --> 00:05:19.533
I'll draw it from above.

00:05:19.533 --> 00:05:20.810
So that's the coastline.

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:22.319
This is land.

00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:23.619
Let's just say it's made up of sand,

00:05:23.619 --> 00:05:25.779
for the sake of argument,
and other things.

00:05:25.779 --> 00:05:27.288
This is water.

00:05:27.638 --> 00:05:28.449
Let's think about it,

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:30.042
first let's think about it in the summer.

00:05:30.042 --> 00:05:33.548
Let's think about in the
summer, when it is hot.

00:05:33.548 --> 00:05:36.088
Think about just a sunny day.

00:05:36.372 --> 00:05:39.158
So in the summer, when things are hot,

00:05:39.158 --> 00:05:42.316
so you have the sun, you
have the sun right over here

00:05:42.316 --> 00:05:44.870
and it's radiating energy and
obviously the area also has,

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:49.625
is also warming up the things
that it comes in touch with.

00:05:50.095 --> 00:05:52.881
But you're having, at
least at the coastline,

00:05:52.881 --> 00:05:55.597
the air is roughly the
same temperature over both

00:05:55.597 --> 00:05:58.175
and, although there
will be some variation,

00:05:58.175 --> 00:05:59.963
and they're getting the
same amount of sunlight.

00:05:59.963 --> 00:06:02.888
But since water has a
higher specific heat,

00:06:02.888 --> 00:06:07.346
that heat is going to warm up water less.

00:06:07.346 --> 00:06:09.273
So this is going to get less hot.

00:06:09.273 --> 00:06:10.620
Let me write it over here.

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:13.122
This is going to get less hot.

00:06:13.755 --> 00:06:14.883
Less hot.

00:06:14.883 --> 00:06:17.270
And the land is going to get more hot.

00:06:17.647 --> 00:06:19.057
More hot.

00:06:19.643 --> 00:06:20.665
More hot.

00:06:20.665 --> 00:06:22.105
And that's why, when
you're on the coastline,

00:06:22.105 --> 00:06:24.450
the air is also affected
by what's in touch with it,

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:26.307
it's gonna be in tough
with this less hot water,

00:06:26.307 --> 00:06:29.070
and so as the air, especially
if it's coming from the ocean,

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:30.928
if the air is going in this direction,

00:06:30.928 --> 00:06:32.576
then if you're at the
coast, you're gonna get

00:06:32.576 --> 00:06:33.853
probably a cooler breeze

00:06:33.853 --> 00:06:35.795
than if you're more inland over here.

00:06:35.795 --> 00:06:37.281
If you're more inland over here,

00:06:37.281 --> 00:06:40.524
the air is going to be hotter.

00:06:40.524 --> 00:06:43.774
So this is going to be
hotter air if you're inland.

00:06:43.774 --> 00:06:45.771
And it's less hot air if
you're at the coastline

00:06:45.771 --> 00:06:48.023
because the air is being
cooled down to some degree,

00:06:48.023 --> 00:06:50.926
it's not being warmed
up as much by the water.

00:06:50.926 --> 00:06:52.458
Now you have the opposite
effect if you think

00:06:52.458 --> 00:06:54.083
about the coldest times of the year.

00:06:54.083 --> 00:06:56.452
If you think about the middle
of the night in the winter.

00:06:56.452 --> 00:06:57.956
So let me draw that.

00:06:59.702 --> 00:07:02.349
If you think about
nighttime in the winter,

00:07:02.349 --> 00:07:04.805
when everything is cooling down,

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:06.390
when everything is cooling down

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:07.899
once you have your coastline.

00:07:07.899 --> 00:07:11.080
Well now, both the land over here

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:14.163
and the water, they're
going to be radiating heat

00:07:14.977 --> 00:07:17.081
and the water is going
to be radiating heat,

00:07:17.081 --> 00:07:18.513
there's no other sources of heat,

00:07:18.513 --> 00:07:20.765
there's radiating heat into the air.

00:07:20.765 --> 00:07:24.782
But if they radiate roughly
the same amount of heat,

00:07:24.782 --> 00:07:27.939
the land is going to drop in
temperature much much more.

00:07:27.939 --> 00:07:29.867
So it's going to get colder here.

00:07:29.867 --> 00:07:31.817
So the land is going to get colder

00:07:31.817 --> 00:07:34.209
and the water is going to get less cold.

00:07:35.029 --> 00:07:36.852
Because it works in both directions.

00:07:36.852 --> 00:07:38.222
More energy goes in the water,

00:07:38.222 --> 00:07:40.149
the temperature changes
less, and it can also radiate

00:07:40.149 --> 00:07:43.864
the same amount of heat,
but also lose less,

00:07:44.464 --> 00:07:46.961
it would also lose less temperature.

00:07:46.967 --> 00:07:49.768
So in the winter, in really
cold times of the year,

00:07:49.768 --> 00:07:51.416
well the air above the water,

00:07:51.416 --> 00:07:52.484
when it comes in touch with the water,

00:07:52.484 --> 00:07:54.829
is going to be less cold
than the air above the land

00:07:54.829 --> 00:07:56.733
because the water is
less cold than the land.

00:07:56.733 --> 00:07:58.451
And so it's nice to live near the water.

00:07:58.451 --> 00:08:00.355
It's going to be less
cold in the coastal areas

00:08:00.355 --> 00:08:02.608
than it would be if you're further inland.

00:08:02.608 --> 00:08:04.604
And this phenomenon,
this is frankly anywhere

00:08:04.604 --> 00:08:05.657
where you might see water,

00:08:05.657 --> 00:08:07.513
but it's very pronounced where I live.

00:08:07.513 --> 00:08:09.071
I live in the San Fransisco Bay area.

00:08:09.071 --> 00:08:13.157
And if you live, you literally
have the Pacific Ocean.

00:08:13.157 --> 00:08:14.388
Let me draw that.

00:08:14.388 --> 00:08:18.590
You have the Pacific Ocean here.

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:22.784
You have the ocean right over here.

00:08:22.784 --> 00:08:27.381
And you have the San Fransisco Bay

00:08:27.381 --> 00:08:29.796
that looks something like that.

00:08:29.796 --> 00:08:32.141
You have your Golden Gate
Bridge right over here,

00:08:32.141 --> 00:08:33.650
for anyone who is curious.

00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:35.369
This is San Fransisco right up here.

00:08:35.369 --> 00:08:37.900
I actually live right about there.

00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:40.523
And you see it, if you
hang out in the summer,

00:08:40.523 --> 00:08:42.799
in the middle of the day in the coastline,

00:08:42.799 --> 00:08:46.700
it could be maybe 10 degrees,
even 20 degrees cooler

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:49.950
than if you are well inland over here.

00:08:49.950 --> 00:08:52.853
So it has a very profound
impact on weather patterns.

00:08:52.853 --> 00:08:55.523
So the last thing you
might be wondering is,

00:08:55.523 --> 00:08:59.284
well why does water have
such a high specific heat?

00:08:59.284 --> 00:09:01.513
Well that goes back to
our good old friend,

00:09:01.513 --> 00:09:03.348
the hydrogen bond.

00:09:03.348 --> 00:09:05.669
Because, if we're talking
about a solid substance,

00:09:06.279 --> 00:09:07.936
if we're talking about a solid substance,

00:09:07.936 --> 00:09:10.690
and I'll just draw a
generic solid substance.

00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:13.398
So solid substance right over here.

00:09:13.398 --> 00:09:14.202
I don't know what this is,

00:09:14.202 --> 00:09:16.478
let's say it's some type of structure

00:09:16.478 --> 00:09:18.846
that looks something like this.

00:09:18.846 --> 00:09:20.471
As it gets energy,

00:09:20.471 --> 00:09:24.720
as it gets heat energy, the
heat energy just increases

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:28.157
the kinetic energy of
the actual particles.

00:09:28.157 --> 00:09:30.270
It actually just makes them vibrate more.

00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:32.151
Makes them vibrate in place more.

00:09:32.151 --> 00:09:33.637
And that's actually what temperature is.

00:09:33.637 --> 00:09:34.983
It's really average kinetic energy.

00:09:34.983 --> 00:09:36.562
When you touch something
and go ooh, that's hot,

00:09:36.562 --> 00:09:38.327
it's really because those
things are just vibrating

00:09:38.327 --> 00:09:41.136
super super super super fast.

00:09:41.136 --> 00:09:42.924
So it's gonna make these
things vibrate more.

00:09:42.924 --> 00:09:44.248
Almost in place, especially
if we're thinking

00:09:44.248 --> 00:09:46.221
about something that is a solid.

00:09:46.221 --> 00:09:49.820
While in the case of water,
sure, when you get more energy,

00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:52.606
it's gonna make the water
molecules move around faster,

00:09:52.606 --> 00:09:54.743
vibrate more, have more kinetic energy.

00:09:54.743 --> 00:09:57.065
But in order to have more kinetic energy,

00:09:57.065 --> 00:09:59.920
they're gonna have to
overcome this kind of creation

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:03.055
and breaking up of the hydrogen bonds.

00:10:03.055 --> 00:10:05.122
You can almost imagine the
friction of a hydrogen bond.

00:10:05.122 --> 00:10:08.117
You can imagine if this
water molecule wants to move

00:10:08.117 --> 00:10:10.439
in this direction, it has
to break this hydrogen bond,

00:10:10.439 --> 00:10:11.669
it's gonna form another hydrogen bond,

00:10:11.669 --> 00:10:12.691
it's gotta break that.

00:10:12.691 --> 00:10:15.700
So it needs energy to keep breaking

00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:17.645
those hydrogen bonds,
overcoming the friction

00:10:17.645 --> 00:10:18.783
of those hydrogen bonds

00:10:18.783 --> 00:10:20.779
and I'll use the friction in quotes

00:10:20.779 --> 00:10:23.194
'cause it's, well actually all friction

00:10:23.194 --> 00:10:26.561
is actually some type of
atomic force that's occurring

00:10:26.561 --> 00:10:28.674
at a microscopic level.

00:10:28.674 --> 00:10:30.090
But it's having to overcome that.

00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:31.545
And so some of this heat energy

00:10:31.545 --> 00:10:33.309
is actually used to overcome that

00:10:33.309 --> 00:10:35.724
as opposed to increasing
the actual kinetic energy

00:10:35.724 --> 00:10:38.580
of the individual molecules,
or making them vibrate

00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:40.577
or whatever to actually
increase their temperature.

00:10:40.577 --> 00:10:43.526
And this is why water is
able to store more heat

00:10:43.526 --> 00:10:47.189
and why it has a higher specific heat.
