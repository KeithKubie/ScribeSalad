hi I'm Christine Brennan we did some

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359
hi I'm Christine Brennan we did some
 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:08.390
hi I'm Christine Brennan we did some
research and we saw that the moon is

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400
research and we saw that the moon is
 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.950
research and we saw that the moon is
drifting away from Earth at one point

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960
drifting away from Earth at one point
 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.080
drifting away from Earth at one point
four to eight inches per year we were

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090
four to eight inches per year we were
 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.930
four to eight inches per year we were
wondering what would happen if the moon

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940
wondering what would happen if the moon
 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.370
wondering what would happen if the moon
finally drifts away thanks Chris

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380
finally drifts away thanks Chris
 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.970
finally drifts away thanks Chris
Brandon I believe Brendon greetings yes

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980
Brandon I believe Brendon greetings yes
 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.109
Brandon I believe Brendon greetings yes
the moon's moving away from the earth

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119
the moon's moving away from the earth
 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.029
the moon's moving away from the earth
what happens when the moon eventually

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039
what happens when the moon eventually
 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.380
what happens when the moon eventually
moves away from the earth you should be

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390
moves away from the earth you should be
 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.370
moves away from the earth you should be
a celestial mechanician you should be an

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380
a celestial mechanician you should be an
 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.560
a celestial mechanician you should be an
orbital mechanical engineer you should

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570
orbital mechanical engineer you should
 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.690
orbital mechanical engineer you should
get a job at Jet Propulsion lab or the

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700
get a job at Jet Propulsion lab or the
 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.940
get a job at Jet Propulsion lab or the
Applied Physics lab that's what you

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950
Applied Physics lab that's what you
 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.190
Applied Physics lab that's what you
should do that's what these people do

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200
should do that's what these people do
 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.350
should do that's what these people do
all day is figure out the orbital

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360
all day is figure out the orbital
 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.779
all day is figure out the orbital
motions of these various bodies so the

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789
motions of these various bodies so the
 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.660
motions of these various bodies so the
moon's moving away so you would presume

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670
moon's moving away so you would presume
 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.150
moon's moving away so you would presume
its influence on the tide would steadily

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160
its influence on the tide would steadily
 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.119
its influence on the tide would steadily
decrease and moving away its orbital

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129
decrease and moving away its orbital
 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.790
decrease and moving away its orbital
period will get slightly longer so the

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800
period will get slightly longer so the
 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.790
period will get slightly longer so the
tides will get slightly more spread out

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800
tides will get slightly more spread out
 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.770
tides will get slightly more spread out
but when it becomes a significant thing

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780
but when it becomes a significant thing
 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.290
but when it becomes a significant thing
that's a long time in the future but

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300
that's a long time in the future but
 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.450
that's a long time in the future but
it's fun to think about isn't it it's

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460
it's fun to think about isn't it it's
 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.170
it's fun to think about isn't it it's
fun to wonder so keep an eye on things

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180
fun to wonder so keep an eye on things
 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.810
fun to wonder so keep an eye on things

twice as much sea water the earth you

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420
twice as much sea water the earth you
 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.060
twice as much sea water the earth you
want to set up a telescope on the far

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070
want to set up a telescope on the far
 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.100
want to set up a telescope on the far
side of the Moon if you want to do that

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110
side of the Moon if you want to do that
 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.149
side of the Moon if you want to do that
you're gonna have to understand these

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159
you're gonna have to understand these
 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.179
you're gonna have to understand these
orbital motions big fun Chris Brendan

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189
orbital motions big fun Chris Brendan
 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.670
orbital motions big fun Chris Brendan
this stuff is is what makes people go to

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:39.680
this stuff is is what makes people go to
 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.800
this stuff is is what makes people go to
schools to learn math so they can

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810
schools to learn math so they can
 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.050
schools to learn math so they can
compute orbital motions and understand

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060
compute orbital motions and understand
 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.540
compute orbital motions and understand
the motions of the heavens so go for it
