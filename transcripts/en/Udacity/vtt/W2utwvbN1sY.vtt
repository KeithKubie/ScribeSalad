00:00:00.195 --> 00:00:03.912
&gt;&gt; Alright so we're back in again, and we're going to attack it I the way

00:00:03.912 --> 00:00:06.432
that we, that you attacked the previous ones,

00:00:06.432 --> 00:00:09.330
where we're going to ask, kind of systematically is the

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.866
VC dimension, greater than or equal to 1, 2, 3, 4 by, by giving examples until

00:00:13.866 --> 00:00:18.170
we just can't anymore [LAUGH]. So good, so

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.800
is the VC greater than or equal to one?

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.060
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.240
&gt;&gt; Yes. So, what would that mean? All we need to do is provide

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.940
a point, I don't know, call it the origin. And.

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:32.740
&gt;&gt; Basically, we get to just pretend that it's like a single point on a line

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:34.610
with a VC dimension of one and it,

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:36.700
the same argument that we had before, applies.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.660
&gt;&gt; That's a good way to say it. Just you know, just think about the

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.210
x asis, axis itself, and we can label

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.690
something, well actually it's simpler in a sense

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.450
because, we can keep the line steady and we can just flip which side is, you

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:48.760
know, by negating all the weights we can

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.340
flip which side is positive and which side

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.930
is negative, and that gives us the 2 labelings of that point.

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.820
&gt;&gt; Right, and because similar argument for VC of 2.

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:58.990
&gt;&gt; So, if the 2 points were on a

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:02.950
line, then to do the 4 different combinations, we could.

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:05.140
&gt;&gt; So right, by putting that line to the left, we

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.410
can label both of them positive. That's easy, or we could label

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:12.035
both of them negative by flipping the weights. Now we've to do

00:01:12.035 --> 00:01:15.780
the other 2 cases where they've different labels. So, I'm going to recommend

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.230
putting a blue line between them.

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:19.090
&gt;&gt; It's a thin blue line.

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.670
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes, and you know, the one on the right is positive the one

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.358
on the left is negative, or we can flip the weights and then flip the signs.

00:01:27.358 --> 00:01:29.450
&gt;&gt; Yes, and 3 is where we got into trouble

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.890
last time, so let's let me start off by giving ourselves

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.260
a clean slate. So, this ran us into trouble in the

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:41.330
case of the intervals because we couldn't do that case and

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.290
it looks like we're kind of hosed again, right?

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.680
&gt;&gt; Yeah, we're. We're actually completely hosed again, if we do this.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:47.227
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:01:47.227 --> 00:01:49.340
&gt;&gt; So, I'm going to say that the

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.080
problem is not with the hypothesis space. The problem

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.430
is with the hand that is drawing points

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:00.170
on the screen. So that's you, so here's the.

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:01.390
&gt;&gt; My hand is really depressed.

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:02.473
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:02:02.473 --> 00:02:03.556
&gt;&gt; [SOUND]

00:02:03.556 --> 00:02:06.360
&gt;&gt; Well, I'm going to make your hand happier. So, I think

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.038
it's right that you can't separate this. It's, and,

00:02:10.038 --> 00:02:11.968
and the reason you can't separate it's because we've

00:02:11.968 --> 00:02:13.610
3 points on the number line and there's just

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.090
sort of nothing to do here, just like we'd before.

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.060
But, we are not restricted to the number line.

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.480
So I'm going to recommend cheating, and moving that

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.940
point in the middle off the number line. So

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.520
make a triangle, stick it up in the middle somewhere.

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.490
&gt;&gt; Alright, and that gives us the ability to handle

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:31.380
this case now, because we can just send our slicey line

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.420
this way. Put everything below it as

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.100
positive and everything above it as negative.

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.110
&gt;&gt; Right, now of course we still, by doing that

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.680
we might have messed up the other labeling, so we

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.510
should check to make certain that we haven't we haven't

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.450
screwed anything up. So, we can, we can make the

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.450
top minus and the bottom, plus that's true and we

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.490
can just by flipping the weights we can make it

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:51.520
the top plus and the bottom minus right? So that's

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.200
good. And the question is that can we do anything else.

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.440
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think it's pretty clear. We could definitely label them all

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.710
positive or all negative just by putting

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:01.550
a vertical line somewhere off to the left.

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:04.310
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I think it's actually easier than this because if you just

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.666
think about vertical lines, then we really are back in the one dimensional case.

00:03:08.666 --> 00:03:12.910
&gt;&gt; Right. And, and we handled the other 7 cases in the

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.140
one dimmensional case really easily. It was just this, this extra case

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:17.600
that we didn't know how to do and now we do, we

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.040
just use that 3rd dimmension. [LAUGH] Or the 2nd dimmension, even better.

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.360
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:27.290
Fair enough. Okay, so the answer's yes. I feel good about that. Okay, so, that's

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.700
good. So we got, we got 1, 2, and 3 out of the way, so

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.460
we know it's more powerful. We know

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:34.540
that it's better. This's, this's kind of nice. So

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:40.710
now the question is 4. So, thinking about it, I think that the answer is no.

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:44.190
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That would be nice, wouldn't it? But, no, we need a, we

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.000
need a slightly better argument and I think, I think we can do that,

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.890
what we need. Again, what would be helpful

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:52.670
is if we had an example, where we could

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.310
say, okay, here's a labeling that no matter how

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:57.360
you lay out the points, you're going to fail.

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.390
&gt;&gt; So, in order for that to work, we need to try to use

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:02.510
all the power of the 2 dimensions so we don't fall in a trap. Right

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:07.720
if, like we almost did with VC3 by making them collinear. So, why don't you

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:13.710
place 4 points in the plane and make a kind of like a diamond shape,

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:15.260
or a square, which is like a diamond.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.510
&gt;&gt; It's a diamond shape if you yeah, tilt your head a little bit.

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:20.230
&gt;&gt; Okay, so I'm going to tilt my head to look at it. So, here's

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:23.100
my argument. Now, I don't know if this's quite right Michael, so, so help me

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:27.190
out with it. The reason I don't think you can do 4 is because we've only got

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:33.273
lines to work with. Okay so, if you connect all the points [CROSSTALK]

00:04:33.273 --> 00:04:33.520
&gt;&gt; Hm-mm.

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.280
&gt;&gt; All, all pairs of points the way they,

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.850
all ways they can be connected. So, you know,

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:42.302
draw the square on the outside and then draw the 2 [CROSSTALK]

00:04:42.302 --> 00:04:42.450
&gt;&gt; Hm-mm.

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:44.830
&gt;&gt; Cross ones in the middle. Does that make sense?

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.960
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it makes sense, but I'm not sure where we're going with this.

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.230
&gt;&gt; Okay, so I'm not either so [LAUGH] so, so, so work with

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:55.830
me. So that's kind of all the boundaries that you can imagine drawing.

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:00.120
And the problem that I see here is that because of the way

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:04.110
that the, the 2 lines that the x and the interior of the square's

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:08.910
set up. There's kind of no way to label the

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:12.230
ones on the other side of those lines differently without

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:13.990
crossing them. So that made no sense what I said,

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:18.730
right? So, try putting the, a plus in the upper left

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:22.100
and bottom right. And minus for the other 2. So,

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:24.010
if you look at the, the 2 1's that are

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:26.390
connected by the line with the plus, and the 2

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:29.190
1s that are connected by the minus, they cross each other,

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:31.930
right? There's no way to put a single line that will

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:34.530
allow you to separate out the pluses from the minuses here.

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:38.500
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah. Exactly. So, in particular anything

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:40.880
that puts, these 2 pluses on the same

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:44.300
side is either going to put one minus or the other minus on that same side.

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:44.810
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:47.450
&gt;&gt; It has a very XOR kind of feeling to it, to me.

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:49.670
&gt;&gt; Yeah does, it, it,it does and in fact

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:51.395
it has an x right there in the middle.

00:05:51.395 --> 00:05:54.160
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It does, no but it, that is true,

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:56.950
but I meant it in a slightly different way, which is if you think

00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:03.367
about these 4 points as actually being you know, zero, zero. 1-1, 0-1 and 1-0.

00:06:03.367 --> 00:06:04.320
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:07.950
&gt;&gt; Then, the labeling here is exactly XOR. And XOR is one of these things

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:11.670
that you can't capture with a linear seperator. So I think, I think you got it.

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:15.860
&gt;&gt; Oh, it makes sense. And I think the important thing here, is that oh

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:19.260
I like the XOR argument. The important thing here is that, no matter where I

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.900
move those four points, I can take the one closer or

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:25.920
one further away. And I could, they're no longer squares, but

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:28.860
whatever I want to be, they're always, you're always going to have

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:32.360
a structure where you can draw those kind of crosses between

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:35.930
the 4 points. Or, you're going to end up collapsing the points

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:38.580
on top of one another or making 3 of them co-linear

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:40.990
or all four of them co-linear and so that makes it

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:43.660
even harder to do any kind of separation. Cause now we're back.

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:44.420
&gt;&gt; Right. You fail

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:46.320
on all the, but there, there's one case that

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:48.620
I'm not sure that you quite described yet. Like that.

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:52.240
&gt;&gt; Right. Well, I think that, that works out to be the same thing, right?

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:54.620
If you draw the connecting lines together they're

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:55.800
all going to cross at the middle point.

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:56.930
&gt;&gt; There's no crossings.

00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:00.490
&gt;&gt; They all cross at that point. They all meet at that point.

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:01.780
&gt;&gt; They don't cross at that point.

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:03.600
&gt;&gt; Well, so those are line segments, but those are just

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:07.410
line segments they represent lines that go on forever. Good point.

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:09.600
&gt;&gt; Yeah so, but the way,

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:13.380
the way that I would see this one is, again to just give an example of a

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:15.680
labeling that just can't be separated would be

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:18.330
this one. Like if you capture the outside points,

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:20.130
assigning all the outside points one label, you

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:22.610
can't assign the input, the inside points a different

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:24.880
label. It's inside the convex hall, it's going

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:26.600
to have the same label as the other ones.

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:30.750
&gt;&gt; Exactly. So, the, and I, and well so in my head the, the main issue

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:33.700
is as lines, when lines cross there's really

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:35.430
nothing you can do with a single line.

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:36.620
Never cross the streams.

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:40.150
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah. It still doesn't feel like quite the same.

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:42.660
I mean maybe we're belaboring this point. Here in this square,

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:46.070
if you actually let this, this corner point pushed into the

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:49.070
middle, then we can, I think we can linearly separate them.

00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:49.570
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:52.810
&gt;&gt; So, I feel like these are 2 different cases,

00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:55.750
but regardless the point is, that what we, what we argued

00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:57.720
is no matter how you lay out the points, there's

00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:00.520
always going to be a labeling that can't be achieved in

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:02.130
the hypothesis class.

00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:04.760
&gt;&gt; Yeah, the whole crossing of the lines thing, really is

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:07.230
about being able to get all 4 points. It's not saying that

00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:10.180
any pair of points. Works out okay. So, what you'd end

00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:12.630
up doing is taking one of those points and dragging them into

00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:14.980
the middle, and then the lines all meet like in, in

00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:18.310
what you've drawn. And you end up with the basically the, the

00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:20.740
same argument. I think it's the same thing. But, I do agree

00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:23.440
with one thing, Michael. Which is that we are belaboring this point.

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:25.630
&gt;&gt; Because the good news or the, the exciting news

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:27.550
is no, we really argued that the

00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:30.330
VC dimension of linear separators is not greater

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:34.659
than or equal to four. So therefore, it's 3. Because 3 works and 4 doesn't.

00:08:34.659 --> 00:08:37.918
&gt;&gt; And 3 is my favorite number. So, I have a question for you

00:08:37.918 --> 00:08:42.381
Michael, I noticed that we keep getting in all the examples we have done so

00:08:42.381 --> 00:08:47.134
far, we keep getting one more VC dimension, so does this kind of argument work

00:08:47.134 --> 00:08:50.878
if I went from planes to, or let's see, 2D space or 3D space or

00:08:50.878 --> 00:08:52.920
4D space or 5D space? is the VC

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:54.720
dimension still three or does it keep getting bigger?
