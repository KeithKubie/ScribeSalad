00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:01.770
Why Engines are Commonly Measured in Horsepower

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.040
We owe the “horsepower” unit of engine
power measurement to Scottish engineer James

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:07.040
Watt.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.480
In the early 1780s, after making a vastly
superior steam engine to the then classic

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:15.770
Newcomen steam engine, Watt was looking for
a way to market his invention, advertising

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:21.120
the fact that his engine used about 75% less
fuel than a similarly powered Newcomen, among

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.210
many other improvements.

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.250
At first, he tried selling his engine on a
royalty scheme, where the customers would

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.710
owe him one-third of the money they saved
by using his engine over other steam engines.

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.500
Of course, many at the time used horses, not
steam engines, so it was difficult to compare

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.030
without them actually buying the engine to
see how it would perform for their particular

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.030
usage.

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.059
Thus, he scrapped the royalty scheme and decided
to try a different tact to convince people

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:45.600
to buy his engine.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.950
Ever the inventor, his solution was to come
up with a new unit of measurement that those

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.739
in need of his engine understood -horse power,
referring to powerful draft horses.

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:58.930
Thus, he set about determining how much power
a typical draft horse could generate.

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:03.240
It isn’t known exactly how he came up with
the numbers he did, as there are conflicting

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.489
accounts of the experiments he ran.

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:11.770
But after doing those experiments, he figured
out a typical draft horse could do about 32,400

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.590
foot-pounds of work in 60 seconds and maintain
that power rate for a good long workday.

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.200
He then rounded up, going with 33,000 foot-pounds
per minute for 1 horsepower.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.859
So, in other words, by his estimation a good
draft horse could lift 33,000 pounds of material

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:33.340
1 foot in 1 minute or 3,300 pounds of material
10 feet in one minute, etc .

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.280
In truth, that’s a very generous estimate
as very few horses could maintain that kind

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.499
of power for a full workday, but getting a
perfect figure wasn’t that important to

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:43.179
what Watt was trying to do.

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:47.700
Further, by overestimating what a horse could
do, whether intentionally or not, he made

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.719
sure that his product would always over deliver
what he said when trying to get people to

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:55.179
buy it, which is a great word-of-mouth marketing
trick.

00:01:55.179 --> 00:02:00.169
In the end, Watt’s engine was revolutionary
and played a huge role in the Industrial Revolution.

00:02:00.169 --> 00:02:04.439
Thanks to this fact, his unit of measure of
an engine’s power, horsepower, also became

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:05.439
popular.

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:09.670
Funny enough, today the SI unit of power,
the Watt, which was named in homage to James

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.590
Watt, has widely come to replace “horsepower”
in most applications.

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.740
Bonus Fact:
While Watt came up with the exact measurement

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.700
of what would become “horsepower,” he
was not the first to propose the idea of equating

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.900
a steam engine’s power to a horse’s.

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.299
The first documented instance of this was
suggested by British inventor Thomas Savery

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:31.780
who wrote the following in a letter in 1702:
“So that an engine which will raise as much

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:37.430
water as two horses, working together at one
time in such a work, can do, and for which

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.590
there must be constantly kept ten or twelve
horses for doing the same.

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.290
Then I say, such an engine may be made large
enough to do the work required in employing

00:02:46.290 --> 00:03:04.379
eight, ten, fifteen, or twenty horses to be
constantly maintained and kept for doing such

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:05.290
a work…”
