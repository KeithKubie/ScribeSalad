00:00:05.664 --> 00:00:07.250
PROFESSOR: Hi everyone.

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:08.060
Welcome back.

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:09.560
So today, we're
going to take a look

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:12.750
at some forced oscillators
and the exponential response

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.150
formula.

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:16.510
And the problem we're going
to take a look at is first,

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:20.570
for part one, to consider the
equation x dot dot plus 8x

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.060
equals, and then a forcing
term on the right-hand side,

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:24.287
cosine omega*t.

00:00:24.287 --> 00:00:26.870
And we're going to consider the
case when omega squared is not

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:28.010
equal to 8.

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:34.470
So in the language of resonance,
we're not on resonance.

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:36.870
And we're also asked
why is this called

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.170
an undamped forced oscillator.

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.970
And then for part
two, to use the ERF

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.002
to solve the differential
equation x dot

00:00:44.002 --> 00:00:49.172
dot plus 2x dot plus
4x equals cosine 3t.

00:00:49.172 --> 00:00:51.130
And then, what is the
natural angular frequency

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.420
of this differential equation?

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.820
So I'll let you take a
look at these problems

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.130
and try them out for yourself.

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:58.338
And I'll be back in a moment.

00:01:09.487 --> 00:01:11.000
Hi everyone.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.400
Welcome back.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.810
So we're asked to find
the general solution

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:25.250
to the differential equation,
x dot dot plus 8x equals cosine

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:25.750
omega*t.

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.180
And notice how this is
a differential equation

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:32.760
with constant coefficients.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.570
But it's being forced
by a periodic function

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:37.230
on the right-hand side.

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:40.180
So the first thing to
do is to write down

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:41.850
the homogeneous solution.

00:01:44.904 --> 00:01:46.320
So the homogeneous
solution, which

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.770
I'll denote with a subscript
h, solves the differential

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:57.420
equation with the
right-hand side of 0.

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.590
This gives us a
characteristic polynomial of s

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:10.539
squared plus 8 equals 0,
which then gives us roots

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:13.100
of plus or minus root 8 i.

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:23.870
So the homogeneous solution
is some constant c_1.

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.380
And when we have
purely imaginary roots,

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:34.250
we have cosine of the
imaginary term times t,

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:39.820
plus some constant c_2 times
sine of the imaginary term,

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:41.610
which in this case is root 8 t.

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:49.516
So the homogeneous solution is
always contains two constants.

00:02:49.516 --> 00:02:51.140
And it solves the
differential equation

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.720
with a zero right-hand side.

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.990
The general solution, however,
is the homogeneous solution

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:00.060
plus one particular solution
that solves the differential

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.970
equation 8 dot dot plus
8x equals cosine omega*t.

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.680
So we just need to find one
solution to this differential

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.670
equation.

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:15.080
And in this case, I'll use the
exponential response formula.

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.090
But first note that when we
use the exponential response

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.090
formula, we need a forcing
to be of the form e to s*t

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:23.620
on the right-hand side.

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.740
And cosine omega*t
is not in that form.

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:28.430
However, what we
can do is there's

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:36.629
a trick to complexify
the right-hand side.

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:38.920
So we note that the cosine
omega*t is actually the real

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.600
part of i*omega*t.

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:53.910
So what this means is if we
have a complex solution, zed,

00:03:53.910 --> 00:04:03.070
which solves z dot dot plus
8z equals e to the i*omega*t,

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:12.250
then we can take x equals
the real part of z,

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:22.260
then solves the differential
equation x dot dot plus 8x

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.630
equals the real part
of the right-hand side,

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:26.380
cosine omega*t.

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.380
And now we're in business
because this equation

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:37.500
has the form where we can
use the exponential response

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.300
formula.

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:42.580
So solving this
differential equation for z,

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.470
we have a particular
solution for z,

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:50.980
is going to be e to
the i*omega*t divided

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:57.130
by the characteristic polynomial
evaluated at the exponential.

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:00.540
So in this case, the
exponential is i*omega.

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:04.960
So we must evaluate the
polynomial at i*omega.

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.640
And this is the solution
provided that the polynomial

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:11.352
evaluated at i*omega
doesn't vanish.

00:05:11.352 --> 00:05:13.310
And in our case, the
characteristic polynomial,

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:22.020
p of s, we worked out already
to be s squared plus 8.

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:26.410
So this gives us a
particular solution for z,

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:33.810
which is 1 divided by
i*omega squared plus 8

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:35.730
on the denominator.

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:37.720
We have e to i*omega
on the numerator.

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:47.300
And of course, 1 over i*omega
squared plus 8 becomes 1 over 8

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:48.350
minus omega squared.

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.390
And we know we
don't have a problem

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:57.800
because omega, we were
told in the problem,

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.380
is not equal to the
square root of 8.

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:03.700
So in this case, we know
that the denominator is not

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:06.570
going to vanish.

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:10.160
And now what we need
to do is just take x,

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:18.430
for the particular solution,
to be the real part of z,

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:24.490
which is going to be the real
part-- I'll write it out--

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:41.950
8 minus omega squared cosine
omega*t plus i sine omega*t,

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:49.580
which gives us 1 over 8 minus
omega squared cosine omega*t.

00:06:56.060 --> 00:07:00.440
So the total solution,
the general solution,

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:03.447
is going to be the sum of
the homogeneous solution

00:07:03.447 --> 00:07:04.655
plus the particular solution.

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:13.820
And in our case, that's going to
be c_1 cosine omega*t plus c_2

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:30.360
sine omega*t plus 1 over 8 minus
omega squared cosine omega*t.

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:31.489
Sorry.

00:07:31.489 --> 00:07:32.530
These should be root 8's.

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:40.210
So this is the homogeneous part.

00:07:44.395 --> 00:07:46.110
And this is the
particular solution.

00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:52.520
And this is the
general solution.

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:55.270
So we were asked, also, why
this is sometimes called

00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:57.750
an undamped forced oscillator.

00:07:57.750 --> 00:08:00.360
Well, it's undamped, because
in the differential equation,

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:01.910
there is no damping term.

00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:04.745
There's no term
proportional to x dot.

00:08:04.745 --> 00:08:07.120
And then, secondly, it's forced
because we have a forcing

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:08.078
on the right-hand side.

00:08:08.078 --> 00:08:11.610
We have an input function, f,
which in this case is cosine

00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:15.200
omega*t which
doesn't depend on x.

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:18.420
And that forces the
differential equation.

00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:20.640
Also note that the
forcing term gives

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:23.430
rise to part of the
solution which is directly

00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:28.130
proportional to the forcing.

00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:31.000
In fact, it has
the same frequency

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.110
but a different amplitude.

00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:36.090
So this concludes part A.

00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:46.630
Now for part B,
we're asked to use

00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:48.470
the ERF to solve
the differential

00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:59.740
equation x dot dot plus 2x
dot plus 4x equals cosine 3t.

00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:10.090
And again, we can
use the same trick.

00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:15.510
The right-hand side isn't
of the form e to the i*3t.

00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:21.660
But what we can do is we can
write cosine 3t as the real

00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:30.870
part of e to the i*3t, and then
solve the differential equation

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:40.870
z dot dot plus 2z dot plus
4z equals e to the i*3t,

00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:45.110
and then take x equals
the real part of z.

00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:46.610
And in this case,
we're only looking

00:09:46.610 --> 00:10:00.130
for a particular solution, which
we can compute using the ERF.

00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:02.420
So it's 1 over the
characteristic polynomial

00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:07.127
evaluated at 3i
times e to the i*3t.

00:10:07.127 --> 00:10:08.710
And what's a
characteristic polynomial

00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:11.556
of this differential equation?

00:10:11.556 --> 00:10:21.680
Well, p of s is going to be s
squared plus 2s plus 4, which

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:31.110
means that p of 3i is going to
be 3i squared plus 2 times 3i

00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:38.700
plus 4, which gives us negative
9 plus 4-- is negative 5--

00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:39.370
plus 6i.

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:47.530
And putting the pieces together,
we end up getting that x is

00:10:47.530 --> 00:10:57.220
equal to the real part of
1 over negative 5 plus 6i e

00:10:57.220 --> 00:10:57.720
to the i*3t.

00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:11.050
And we can expand out the
numerator using Euler's formula

00:11:11.050 --> 00:11:16.350
to get cosine 3t plus i sine 3t.

00:11:16.350 --> 00:11:22.360
And when the dust
settles, I got 1 over 61--

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:35.480
let me check my notes-- minus
5 cosine 3t plus 6 sine 3t.

00:11:39.084 --> 00:11:41.250
So I'll let you work at
this last step for yourself.

00:11:44.399 --> 00:11:46.690
And then, lastly, what is
the natural angular frequency

00:11:46.690 --> 00:11:48.700
of the differential equation?

00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:50.530
Well, this is just
some notation.

00:11:50.530 --> 00:11:53.430
We sometimes call the
natural angular frequency

00:11:53.430 --> 00:11:58.830
to be the square root of
the term proportional to x.

00:11:58.830 --> 00:12:00.870
So in this case,
the term two here

00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:03.130
comes in as a damping term.

00:12:03.130 --> 00:12:07.420
The natural frequency,
which is sometimes

00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:10.240
written as omega naught
squared, is always

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:13.300
equal to this term, which is 4.

00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:16.210
So the natural frequency, the
natural angular frequency,

00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:17.930
omega naught, would
be the square root

00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:19.030
of 4, which would be 2.

00:12:21.770 --> 00:12:23.380
So I just like to quickly recap.

00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:25.810
We've taken a look at
forced oscillators.

00:12:25.810 --> 00:12:28.530
And we computed their
solutions using the ERF.

00:12:28.530 --> 00:12:30.820
And one common trend,
particularly when

00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:34.930
we have an oscillating
input, a forcing term,

00:12:34.930 --> 00:12:37.400
is to first change
the oscillating term

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:41.330
into a complex
exponential, then compute

00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:45.650
a particular solution
using the ERF formula,

00:12:45.650 --> 00:12:49.880
and then take the real
part of the ERF solution

00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:53.130
to recover a real
solution to the ODE.

00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:55.009
That gives us the
particular solution.

00:12:55.009 --> 00:12:56.550
And then, in some
cases, we also have

00:12:56.550 --> 00:12:59.290
to add the homogeneous
solution to it

00:12:59.290 --> 00:13:03.260
to get the full general
solution to the ODE.

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:04.800
So I'd like to conclude here.

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:06.980
And I'll see you next time.
