the American foreign minister could make

00:42:13.950 --> 00:42:13.960
the American foreign minister could make

00:42:30.109 --> 00:42:30.119
 

00:42:30.119 --> 00:42:33.480
this is just a beginning of common

00:42:44.120 --> 00:42:44.130
beginning so I think this shows that the
 

00:42:44.130 --> 00:42:47.430
beginning so I think this shows that the
