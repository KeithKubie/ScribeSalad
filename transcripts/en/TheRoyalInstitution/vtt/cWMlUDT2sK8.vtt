00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:15.640
Air is a mixture of several
elements, mainly nitrogen, and

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.980
oxygen, and trace amounts
of the noble gases.

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.240
But this wasn't realised for
hundreds of years, and this is

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.850
because you can't see
these elements.

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:26.170
They're invisible.

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:30.110
But there's one element that has
such a beautiful colour in

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:33.415
the gas phase it was actually
named because of this.

00:00:33.415 --> 00:00:36.380
And it was named by
Sir Humphry Davy.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.830
Some experiments and
observations on a new

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:55.880
substance which becomes a
violet-colored gas by heat, by

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:00.350
Sir Humphry Davy, January
20, 1814.

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.840
"A new and very curious
substance has recently

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.940
occupied the attention
of chemists of Paris.

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.230
The substance appears as a
vapour of a beautiful violet

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:13.010
colour."

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.280
Davy notes that when the new
substance is exposed to liquid

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.570
ammonia a black powder is
formed which when dry,

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.130
fulminates by the slightest
contact or friction.

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.125
What he means is, when you
touch it, it explodes.

00:01:37.965 --> 00:01:44.320
I'm trying to smear some of
this rather unpleasant

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:52.800
nitrogen triiodide, but it's
deeply unpleasant when dried

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.735
and incredibly unstable.

00:01:55.735 --> 00:01:59.470
I've just come to check to
see how this is doing.

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.380
The problem is it needs to dry,
and it isn't going to

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.230
work until it's dried.

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:08.370
But the longer we leave it,
it could go off by itself.

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:11.738
So it's very nervous
at the moment.

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:55.474
[EXPLOSION]

00:02:55.474 --> 00:02:57.959
[EXPLOSIONS]

00:02:57.959 --> 00:02:59.209
Oh.

00:03:03.923 --> 00:03:05.173
[INAUDIBLE].

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.126
But I felt that force right
in my stomach here.

00:03:12.126 --> 00:03:15.577
That was a good cloud,
wasn't it?

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.500
So what we've just seen there is
the explosive decomposition

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.410
of nitrogen triiodide into
nitrogen gas and well, the

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.660
purple cloud of iodine vapour.

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:35.370
The explosion has sprayed
nitrogen triiodide everywhere,

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.580
so I feel rather sorry for
whoever is going to be in the

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.214
lecture theatre next.

00:03:40.214 --> 00:03:47.040
[POPPING NOISES]

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.412
Ha, nothing's happening.

00:03:48.412 --> 00:03:49.256
This is quite good though.

00:03:49.256 --> 00:03:50.345
The suspense is good, isn't it?

00:03:50.345 --> 00:03:51.235
Yeah.

00:03:51.235 --> 00:03:53.460
Is it going to go?

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:57.257
Oh, your reaction is good.

00:03:57.257 --> 00:04:15.615
