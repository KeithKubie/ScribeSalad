Kevin here.

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:05.200
I interviewed five scientists
on the day they emerged

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.280
from a 12-month
Mars isolation study.

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:10.540
I simply asked
them one thing:

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.260
"Now that you're back..."

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:14.600
"What do you 
have to tell the world?"

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.200
Here's what they said.
