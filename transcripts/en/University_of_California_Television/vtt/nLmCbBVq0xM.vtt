00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:29.140
We are the paradoxical ape, bipedal
naked, large-brained,

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:35.400
long the master of fire,
tools and language,  but still

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:43.370
trying to understand ourselves. Aware that
death is inevitable yet filled with

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:52.870
optimism. We grow up slowly. We hand down
knowledge. We empathize and deceive.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:01:00.690
We shape the future from our shared
understanding of the past. CARTA brings

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:07.090
together experts from diverse disciplines
to exchange insights on who we are and how

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:14.130
we got here. An exploration made possible
by the generosity of humans like you.

00:02:25.601 --> 00:02:27.550
- [Peter] So I've been spending some
time working on this

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:31.950
question about the role of climate change
in early human evolution. I think that the

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:37.350
best way to frame it is that our best
understanding of this problem is really

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:42.710
it's this relationship between climate and
life. That is how has climate shaped life

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:46.860
and how's life shaped climate? I think the
best way to convince ourselves that this

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:53.110
is something that's in our blood, in our
entire world is to look at a seasonal map

00:02:53.110 --> 00:03:00.610
of primary productivity in the oceans and
on land. Over a multiple year period you

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.110
can see the waxing and the waning of
growth on the planet following the

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:09.570
seasons. The planet literally breaths with
life that's paced by just the tilt of our

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:13.780
earth with respect to the point of
its orbit around the sun. Also if we take

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.170
the longest possible perspective we also
find that climate shapes life. Each of the

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.540
five major mass extinctions in life on
earth over the last 500 plus million

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:28.310
years, each of those five has been
associated with a change in the

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:33.640
environment. And each one of these red
lines here are where the mass extinctions

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:38.610
occurred. Where somewhere between 50% and
90% of all species that were alive at the

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:42.550
time became extinct. There are some who
have argued that there should be another

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:47.160
red line there for today. The last
extinction was the extinction of the

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.390
dinosaurs and that paved the way for the
rise of mammals. Today I'm going to be

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:55.820
talking about this last little sliver
of time that includes our history. If we

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:00.680
look at this history of human evolution
this is a greatly simplified diagram of

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.620
the human phylogeny or the family tree.
You can basically see this sort of red,

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:10.710
yellow and green sections. The human
family tree is sometimes been likened to a

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:17.190
Y-shaped pattern or a more bushy one if
you're more of a... not so much of a

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:24.671
lumper. So we move from a single very
long-lived lineage of Australopithecines

00:04:24.671 --> 00:04:28.370
up until about somewhere around 3 million
years ago where the family tree takes's a

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:32.510
branch. One lineage the yellow is
sometimes referred to as the Paranthropus.

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:36.580
They are sought of the line backers of the
human family tree. They ultimately were

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:41.400
not successful. Then the blue lineage
which is our own. That is the genus Homo.

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:45.660
It's been described actually Rick Potts
and I were part of a national

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:51.840
research council committee to evaluate
these main times of human evolution. It

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:57.840
appeared there are two main periods where
there's a lot of action going on focused

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:02.730
intervals of time. This includes this time
interval from about 3 million to about 2.6

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:06.270
million years ago when there are at least
several things that are happening at this

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:12.360
time. The extinction of Australopithecus
afarensis otherwise known as Lucy. Also

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:16.140
the appearance of these two lineages our
Genus Homo and the Genus Paranthropus

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:19.750
Then this is also when the first
stone tools appear. Some time along 3

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:24.010
million years ago. Then another event
occurs sometime just after 2 million years

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:30.400
ago. Where we see the appearance or the
extinction of early Homo, the emergence of

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:34.750
Homo erectus. The first time we start
seeing the acheulean tool kit which is a

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:39.710
much more sophisticated tool kit that
would become the model for future stone

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:45.100
tools. Then this is also the first out of
Africa. This is the first time our

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:49.730
ancestors left the African continent. It
was about 1.8 million years ago. The point

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:55.480
of my discussion today is to ask this
question if climate is shaping life did it

00:05:55.480 --> 00:06:00.970
also shape human origins? The question
here really is not so much just asking

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:06.160
this question did climate shape life, does
shape human evolution but you really have

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:10.310
to ask the primary question which is how
did African climate change? That turns out

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:16.240
to be a really challenging problem for a
number of very reasonable reasons. I will

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:22.900
let you know that the aim of this talk is
really to illuminate these two main ways

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:26.380
that African climate has changed in the
past. One is that there have been this

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:31.860
very regular pendulum swings if you will.
Very rapid in geologic times, roughly

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:35.630
every 20,000 years where African climate
oscillated between wet and drier

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:39.450
conditions. It's been like a pace maker
throughout millions millions of years. The

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:43.640
other thing that's happened super imposed
on these wet dry cycles is this long term

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:48.960
shift toward more open air conditions. If
you allow your mind's eye to envision East

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:53.300
Africa right now you probably thinking
about the Serengeti or these open fields

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:59.780
of glasses. That ecosystem is actually a
geologically very recent phenomena only a

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:04.330
couple of million years old. When we look
at the past African climate change we see

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:09.320
that variations in the strength of the
African monsoon have been paced by

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:14.180
variations in orbital procession. This is
basically that the earth has a wobbling in

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:21.030
its orbit. Our northern hemisphere, our
star Polaris right now the orbiting star

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:25.690
10,000 years ago was actually the star of
Vega. Which is about forty seven and a

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:31.440
half degrees of in the other direction.
The earth's rotational axis swipes out a

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:35.780
cone in the celestial sphere on the 20,000
year beat. What that does on earth is

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:39.900
it changes the seasonal distribution of
sunlight such that over Africa the

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:43.730
northern hemisphere summers would have
been about 7% more sunlight in the winter

00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:49.120
that had exactly the amount less. What
this means for Africa is that it's

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:53.160
strengthens; it invigorates the African
monsoon with 20,000 year beat. It

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:58.970
acts really like a volume knob on the
strength of the monsoon. These intervals

00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:03.600
in green that are shown here would be
times of what we call an African humid

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:08.750
period. A time when it would have been
wetter in the past. You'll see that they

00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:13.010
would have been paced at this 20 year beat
throughout this time period. Now we know

00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:16.890
this is actually true. So this actually
predicted from theory and what amazing and

00:08:16.890 --> 00:08:20.270
this is one for the reasons why I work in
this field is that when we look at the

00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:24.370
geological record for this it shows that
they were this wet periods in the time.

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:30.150
This is actually from the sediment core in
the eastern Mediterranean where a sediment

00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:34.310
core was drilled in this location. This is
a 10 meter core. This is one and a half

00:08:34.310 --> 00:08:37.480
meters and it connects with the top up
there. The base of this connects to the

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:42.100
top of there and so on. You can see it has
these black and white layers. The black

00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:46.180
layers are these organic sediments that
accumulated when the Nile River outflows

00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:51.460
much much greater than today. So that made
for anoxic or low oxygen conditions in the

00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:54.940
bottom of the Mediterranean. Just like if
you turn off the bubbler in your fish

00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:58.070
tank all the fish die and the organic
matter goes to the bottom that's what

00:08:58.070 --> 00:09:01.870
happened during each one of these events.
It happens not only for this time period

00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:06.480
here representing maybe 200,000 years of
time but actually for millions of years.

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:12.250
This actually an outcrop that we see in
Sicily. It's actually a shot from a bar in

00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:18.180
Sicily. These are actually people working
on this outcrop. You can barely see that

00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:22.290
little red dot. In each of these dark
layers is one of these self sapropel

00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:26.070
units. You can see how they are
bundled into groups of four and five which

00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:30.590
is this eccentricity modulation of these
processional cycles. Each one of these

00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:35.830
dark layers will get 20,000 years apart.
This represents one million years of time

00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:39.860
going back 10 million years ago. So this
has just been a heartbeat of African

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:44.380
climate change going on for millions and
millions of years unbroken. If we look at

00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:49.300
Lake Turkana for example. Lake Turkana in
northern Kenya is nestled in a desert

00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:52.220
environment today but if you go to the
shores of lake Turkana you'll see this

00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:57.200
bathtub rings where lake Turkana was 50
meters or 150 feet higher than it is today

00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:01.000
during one of these wet phases 10,000
years ago. That's just one of these little

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.520
bars at the very top. You can see they've
been just hundreds of these in the past.

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:09.680
African climate has been nothing but
continuously varying between wet and dry

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:13.710
and wet and dry. So we look at the
grassland expansion. This is the second

00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:17.590
way that African climate has changed over
the time scale of early human evolution.

00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:21.400
Again I show you this image of these
grasslands from East Africa. These

00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:27.000
actually cover something between 80% and
90% of the East African landscape today.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:32.410
These envision of let's say the Serengeti
this vision that we all have of East

00:10:32.410 --> 00:10:36.410
Africa is actually very recent geological
development, only about two to three

00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:40.790
million years old. What's interesting
about this savannah grassland is that they

00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:45.910
represent a very specific ecological
adaptation to a very specific environment.

00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:52.860
That environment is hot, dry, very
seasonal rainfall, and low carbon dioxide.

00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:58.570
In fact the photosynthetic pathway that...
This is called C4 because it represents

00:10:58.570 --> 00:11:02.150
the four carbon compounds that's developed
through photosynthesis verses a three

00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:10.660
carbon compound. The C4 molecules or the
C4 photosynthesis is adapted to very high

00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:15.270
temperatures and low atmospheric CO2 and
generally dry conditions. So these

00:11:15.270 --> 00:11:20.480
constitute the tropical grasses that
dominate Africa particularly East Africa

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:26.650
today. They are there because the
environment is very harsh. It's dry and

00:11:26.650 --> 00:11:34.330
seasonally moist. Only moist seasonally
and it also during low CO2 environments.

00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:38.010
How can we reconstruct how vegetation has
changed in the past? The first thing that

00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:41.410
you might say is why don't we just look at
pollen. The problem with working with

00:11:41.410 --> 00:11:45.720
pollen is that pollens are often not very
well preserved in sediments. Any kind of

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:50.960
oxygen inhaling deposition environment the
pollen will disappear. So we have a much

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:58.850
more elegant way to explore which actually
exploits the biochemical way in which the

00:11:58.850 --> 00:12:05.260
photosynthesis works using the C4 pathway.
This is a brief overview of

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:10.140
carbon isotopes. These are the two stable
isotopes of carbon. Carbon 14 is the

00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:15.040
radioactive or unstable isotope of carbon.
Carbon 12. Most of our bodies are made up

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:21.990
of that. 99% of carbon in our bodies is
carbon 12. This is the most common isotope

00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:27.040
of carbon. Then carbon 13 is only about
one in one hundred or about 1% of the

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:32.740
carbon in the environment. What we do is
we measure the ratio of carbon 13 to

00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:38.590
carbon 12 using a mass spectrometer and
then express that ratio as a change

00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:41.200
relative to a standard using this
equation. This is the only equation I will

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:47.080
show for the day but this notation that
we'll be talking about. What we see here

00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:53.340
is that the C3 verses C4 with plant
signatures the grasslands have a much more

00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:59.600
enriched or more positive C4 carbonized to
value than to c3 plants. C3 plant will be

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:03.630
trees and everything else. C4 plants in
the tropics are going to be this savannah

00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:11.110
grasses. If we jump forward to really
heroic collaboration that existed with the

00:13:11.110 --> 00:13:18.040
Naomi Levin and Thure Cerling over the
past decade or so. They've measured carbon

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:22.360
isotope values from soil carbonates. Which
are these little carbonated nodules that

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:26.100
form in soils that record the
photosynthetic pathway the plants that are

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:30.320
above them. So you go to a geological
outcrop, you collect this soil carbonates,

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:33.610
and you measure their soil carbonate. That
tells you what the vegetation was at the

00:13:33.610 --> 00:13:39.630
time that that thing had formed. What you
can see is this transition from lower

00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:43.690
values to higher values. Meaning an
increase in the grasslands. This

00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:48.600
transition is almost about a 50% increase
in grass cover. You can see that the

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:51.710
timing of that transition is sometime
around somewhere between three and two

00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:56.620
million years ago. Compare that to this
record of the sapropels where

00:13:56.620 --> 00:14:02.080
you get very rapid cycling between wet and
drier conditions. This a secular change.

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:06.430
This is a very rapid back and forth kind
of like a pendulum change. The way that we

00:14:06.430 --> 00:14:12.980
can now explore past vegetation changes is
actually very beautiful forensic tool that

00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:18.630
was developed which allows us to look at
fossils but this are not megascopic

00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:22.270
fossils. These are not fossil skulls, they
are not fossil shells, they not fossil

00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:27.650
paleosol carbonate nodules. These
are actually fossil molecules. The

00:14:27.650 --> 00:14:33.420
molecules derived from ancient plants. All
higher plants have an epicuticular wax

00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:38.340
that is waxes on the outer surface of the
leaves. You see in a rubber plant that's

00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:43.050
nothing but wax on the outside. Those waxy
molecules are very robust. They last for a

00:14:43.050 --> 00:14:49.000
very long time. We can take a sediment, we
can basically crush it and then put it in

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.730
something that looks for all the world
like an espresso maker but it

00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:56.720
has very nasty solvents inside of it. We
will extract this straw-colored liquid

00:14:56.720 --> 00:15:01.020
which is loaded with these plant wax
molecules. Loaded meaning one in a billion

00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:04.620
of the carbon molecules in here will be
plant waxes. So they're not really loaded

00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:09.690
but they are sort of loaded. When we look
at them we can actually measure with the

00:15:09.690 --> 00:15:15.190
chromatography what the compounds are and
when you see this interdigitation between

00:15:15.190 --> 00:15:19.880
low and high peaks that just shouts out
you. Looks like a hand and says I am from

00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:25.350
the plant. This class of molecules,
this class of compounds are all drawn out

00:15:25.350 --> 00:15:30.280
from photosynthesis. What we can do is we
can take each of these peaks and then

00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:33.940
instead of blowing that carbon out into
the atmosphere we then direct it into a

00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:39.430
mass spectrometer. We measure the carbon
ratio of those compounds, that's how we

00:15:39.430 --> 00:15:43.380
can figure out whether that fossil plant
that made those weak leaf waxes was a

00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:48.060
C3 or C4 plant. My student, Sara Feekins
is now a tenured professor

00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:52.790
at USC did this at an ocean drilling
program site here in the Gulf of Aden.

00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:56.760
A place that's very difficult to go to
today. This is the extent of savannah

00:15:56.760 --> 00:16:02.380
grasses there today. This is her record,
basically a snap shot record from the

00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:05.720
site. You can see it shows that same
trend. That same increase in values

00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:12.290
indicating the emergence of the
grasslands. If you compare her record to

00:16:12.290 --> 00:16:17.380
the Naomi Levens' record you see they
both have this transition. This both sort

00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:22.120
of circular transition towards greater
grasslands. What's impressive is that

00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:26.790
these green periods are the same green
periods of major events of human

00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:31.810
evolution. You can see that these
transitions towards an initial expansion

00:16:31.810 --> 00:16:36.730
in grasslands after about three million
years ago. Then really their establishment

00:16:36.730 --> 00:16:41.460
around two million years ago is coincident
with some changes that we're seeing in

00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:48.280
early human evolution. What for me was the
biggest the most exciting discovery in

00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:52.420
this relationship between climate change
and human evolution was what showed up in

00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:56.690
the proceedings in the national academy of
sciences about a year and a half ago by

00:16:56.690 --> 00:17:01.210
Terry Serling but also a number of
co-authors contributed to this study.

00:17:01.210 --> 00:17:05.200
These are the same records that I showed
earlier. This increase in indicators of

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:10.100
grasses sometime after three million
reaching peak values around two million.

00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:14.840
So this is basically the same figures that
I showed earlier. What Terry and his

00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:19.880
colleagues did was to measure the carbon
isotopes of the tooth enamel in fossil

00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:25.840
skulls. So they took the teeth and they
analyzed the carbon isotopes of the teeth

00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:31.980
and you are what you eat. You see this
relationship you can see that when you

00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:37.040
look at early ancestral humans or
ancestral hominids you can see their

00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:42.370
basically tracking the environment. If the
environment changes your chemistry

00:17:42.370 --> 00:17:48.060
changes. Basically the hominids are just
tracking the environment and you say okay

00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:52.230
we're done all right its working. I mean
basically they're just following

00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:56.160
environment and you can also say people
couldn't care less about the environment

00:17:56.160 --> 00:18:00.250
because look they're just tracking the
environment watch what happens. The one

00:18:00.250 --> 00:18:07.500
group that doesn't do that is us. These
blue dots are carbonized isotopic analysis

00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:14.160
of early and late members of the genus
Homo. You can see that they are falling

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:19.410
away from their other lineage parenthesis
which they share the landscape with. So

00:18:19.410 --> 00:18:26.390
Paranthropus, their diet was mainly
derived from savannah grasses. Early Homo

00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:33.060
had a more variable diet and they were
able basically to extract a flexible diet

00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:37.390
from an increasingly inflexible landscape.
So more to come soon. This is my

00:18:37.390 --> 00:18:40.430
post-doc Kevin Uno for those
of you who want to see some

00:18:40.430 --> 00:18:44.680
truly spectacular new results that I'm
happy to talk about that. But really Rick

00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:47.830
Potts and Andy Cohen have been leaders
because they've lead a drilling program up

00:18:47.830 --> 00:18:53.080
and down the Rift Valley collecting more
and more of these sediment archives. So

00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:56.575
what I'm showing you is just a teaser for
what they're about to do.

00:18:56.575 --> 00:18:58.435
Thank you very much Charlie.

00:19:08.250 --> 00:19:10.851
[Hublin] Today I would like to present you

00:19:10.851 --> 00:19:19.310
some thoughts about Neanderthal evolution
and to what extent climate might have

00:19:19.310 --> 00:19:26.050
influenced their evolution. Before I start
with climate and Neanderthals I wanted to

00:19:26.050 --> 00:19:34.920
show you this slide presenting on the left
side a Neanderthal and a modern human both

00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:43.940
of the same age. In front you have two
skulls of extinct apes, bonobo and a

00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:51.090
common chimpanzee. This is just to show
you how Neanderthals are different from us

00:19:51.090 --> 00:19:57.200
in terms of anatomy, in terms of phenotype
in general. Modern humans and Neanderthal

00:19:57.200 --> 00:20:04.580
ancestors diverged probably about half a
million years ago. When bonobos and common

00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:11.080
chimpanzees diverged much earlier probably
somewhere between two and one million

00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:17.380
years ago. One of the, I would say,
mysteries regarding Neanderthals is what

00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:26.490
kind of evolutionally process was driving
these very rapid divergence. The way we

00:20:26.490 --> 00:20:32.230
like to think on the Neanderthals, the way
they are presented in the literature is

00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:39.250
this way. Humans adapted to a glacial
environment peri Arctic environment

00:20:39.250 --> 00:20:44.580
and as a matter of fact if we have a look
on this very jerky climatic curve

00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:49.960
that you're going to see quite a number of
times today I imagine. You can see that

00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:58.670
for the last half a million years 95% of
the time the climate was colder than it is

00:20:58.670 --> 00:21:06.210
today in the area where Neanderthals lived
mainly western Eurasia. This being said

00:21:06.210 --> 00:21:12.710
the climate was not always glacial. The
glacial episodes were rather brief

00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:19.350
actually. The most extreme part of this
glacial episodes. If you have a look on

00:21:19.350 --> 00:21:24.220
this map that's the map showing you the
distribution of places where Neanderthals

00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:30.580
have been found you see that actually
they're not documented very high in

00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:37.130
latitude. There is the northern most
Neanderthal every found was found 52

00:21:37.130 --> 00:21:44.940
degrees of northern latitude which is not
so high. Neanderthals lived also in places

00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:50.860
like Spain and southern Italy and the
[inaudible 00:21:47] that never witnessed

00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:58.150
really glacial episodes. So the question
is what in their environment first of all

00:21:58.150 --> 00:22:03.460
drove their distribution and also drove
their evolution. The distribution that you

00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:09.830
see now is probably I would say misleading
somehow because it's a palimpsest of

00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:15.080
the distribution of Neanderthals through a
very long period of time. In other words

00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:21.120
at a given point in the past they had
never had these extension. So it's sort of

00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:28.310
addition of many distribution and it's
very likely that they reach this eastern

00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:34.040
most extension in the southern Siberia in
the Italian. This also true for the new

00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:42.260
east, south western Asia only at some
point in the late evolution. Speaking

00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:48.390
about climate and influence of climate on
evolution we have quite a number of

00:22:48.390 --> 00:22:55.860
studies showing how climate can influence
the biology and morphology of modern

00:22:55.860 --> 00:23:04.600
humans. Probably one of the most, I would
say, spectacular feature that relates to

00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:11.660
climate in extinct humans is the body
shape in general. There are a number of

00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:20.060
studies showing that the proportions of
the limbs, the shapes of the trunk varies

00:23:20.060 --> 00:23:25.280
with climate. Basically people exposed to
very hot climate need to cool their

00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:33.080
bodies, they tend to be slimmer, to have
narrow trunks, and longer limbs. People

00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:42.680
exposed to very cold environments they
tend to be more skewed to have shorter

00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:51.270
limbs, and wider trunks. This kind of
study it's multivariate study taking into

00:23:51.270 --> 00:23:59.530
account many population schedules. How you
can basically rank populations from the

00:23:59.530 --> 00:24:06.780
tropics. On the right side you have people
from East and West Africa up to the higher

00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:13.280
attitudes in green you have European
population. If you take measurements of

00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:21.130
the body shape of Neanderthal and you plot
it in this kind of chart. This is the case

00:24:21.130 --> 00:24:27.189
of one Neanderthal well known called
La Chapelle-aux Saints. It falls beyond

00:24:28.050 --> 00:24:36.960
any modern European and even beyond modern
inuits. It's said to have hyper

00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:43.460
[inaudible 0:24:39] body proportion.
Interestingly if you plot on the same

00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:49.510
chart early modern humans who came into
Europe about 50,000 years ago to replace

00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:56.610
Neanderthals they plot very close to
population from modern Sudan. Which by the

00:24:56.610 --> 00:25:03.490
way it's certainly one of the best
arguments to make them come out of Africa

00:25:03.490 --> 00:25:11.290
besides genetical arguments. However we
should be very I would say conscious with

00:25:11.290 --> 00:25:17.660
these feature because climatic adaptation
is not just a biological adaptation in

00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:25.020
humans it's also a cultural adaptation and
a technical adaptation. In other words we

00:25:25.020 --> 00:25:32.080
suspect that even if Neanderthals were not
exposed to always very cold climates

00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:36.960
because of the limitation of their
technology the biological response might

00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:43.310
have been higher than what we have in
extinct humans. As a matter of fact if we

00:25:43.310 --> 00:25:48.190
look at the archaeological record we find
very few archaeological sites left by

00:25:48.190 --> 00:25:52.620
Neanderthals in truly periArctic
environments. It looks like during the

00:25:52.620 --> 00:25:59.590
coldest phrases of the glacial episodes
large portions of Europe have been

00:25:59.590 --> 00:26:05.880
abandoned by the Neanderthals. There are
other features that have been said to be

00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:11.570
related to climate Neanderthals especially
their very peculiar facial morphology.

00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:19.060
They have a very strong mesial facial
prognathism. There's very big nose

00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:27.490
projecting and on the side of the nasal
aperture inside the face you have volumes

00:26:27.490 --> 00:26:34.170
which are sinuses which are said to be
very developed in Neanderthals in general.

00:26:34.170 --> 00:26:39.700
In a sort of naive way people have thought
for a long time that the development of

00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:46.910
sinuses in Neanderthals was sort of
insulation against cold. This idea has

00:26:46.910 --> 00:26:52.160
been very criticized actually it's
completely abandoned today because we see

00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:59.350
more of these sinuses as a sort of filling
an empty space between other structures

00:26:59.350 --> 00:27:07.870
that are adapted to different functions.
It's more interesting to look at another

00:27:07.870 --> 00:27:15.130
aspect of the face which is the nose.
Actually if you look at extinct humans you

00:27:15.130 --> 00:27:20.500
will see that one of the most varying
parts of the face is the nose and the

00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:25.410
shape of the nasal aperture. One of these
skulls comes from Germany and the other

00:27:25.410 --> 00:27:31.360
one from Zaire in Africa. Immediately you
can see that the shape of the nasal

00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:38.990
aperture is very different in these two
individuals. There are quite a number of

00:27:38.990 --> 00:27:47.840
studies showing that actually in humans
the nose and especially the inner nose is

00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:55.160
adapted to the climate conditions in
different regions. Primarily what we have

00:27:55.160 --> 00:28:03.500
is a problem with cold and dry areas.
Individuals population that are exposed to

00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:12.420
cold and dry environments tend to have
nasal cavities that are higher and

00:28:12.420 --> 00:28:19.630
narrower in order to increase the
turbulence of the air that is inspired and

00:28:19.630 --> 00:28:26.160
to increase contact between the mucus of
tissues and this air to warm it and to

00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:36.890
moist it. The nasopharynx seems to be more
depending on moisture. The nasal cavity

00:28:36.890 --> 00:28:44.630
itself with cold. What about
Neanderthals? At the first look

00:28:44.630 --> 00:28:48.470
Neanderthals seems no to march very well
this prediction because they have these

00:28:48.470 --> 00:28:55.620
huge nasal aperture that is somehow
unexpected if they were exposed to cold

00:28:55.620 --> 00:29:02.140
environments. Actually the business of
aperture is especially broad in its upper

00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:07.460
part which is not what we find in modern
tropical population. But if we look inside

00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:15.460
the nasal aperture we see that there are a
number of structures that inflate the

00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:23.910
walls of the nasal aperture in order to
narrow this nasal aperture. Although the

00:29:23.910 --> 00:29:33.210
nasal aperture is very bold outside the
cavity inside is much narrower and match

00:29:33.210 --> 00:29:40.230
the prediction we can make of a cold
adapted population. Last but not least we

00:29:40.230 --> 00:29:47.470
have now a number of information coming
from paleogenetical studies. I'm

00:29:47.470 --> 00:29:52.280
sure they are much more to come in the
future but we know already that a couple

00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:58.760
features of Neanderthals that we can
relate to the climate, the environment. I

00:29:58.760 --> 00:30:07.470
would like at least to mention this gene
called MC1R which is a receptor involved

00:30:07.470 --> 00:30:14.690
in the reder and fair complexions. Very
likely at least on the Neanderthals on

00:30:14.690 --> 00:30:26.180
which this gene has been detected we deal
with population with light skin color and

00:30:26.180 --> 00:30:34.050
red hair. We have some adaptation to the
cold environment in Neanderthals but the

00:30:34.050 --> 00:30:39.620
question is are there other effects of the
climate on the evolution? I would like now

00:30:39.620 --> 00:30:43.840
to deal with something that I found
probably more important than that

00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:49.710
adaptation itself. One of the questions
about Neanderthal evolution is why do we

00:30:49.710 --> 00:30:57.360
have this divergence between an African
lineage leading to us and this Arasian

00:30:57.360 --> 00:31:02.240
plague about half a million years ago.
What happened at this moment? Why then why

00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:10.570
not before? It raises the question of when
exactly we have the first Neanderthals.

00:31:10.570 --> 00:31:15.380
The first Neanderthals we have in the
fossil record are about 400,000 years.

00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:19.820
They are from in England, there are from
Spain and this age a little bit about

00:31:19.820 --> 00:31:24.210
400,000 has been some time in conflict
with the dates that were provided by

00:31:24.210 --> 00:31:37.110
genetists. Genetists using molecular clock
base on computations, using the assumed

00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:44.190
time of divergence of fossil groups came
to a much younger ages for the divergence

00:31:44.190 --> 00:31:56.330
for Neanderthals and modern humans. You
know something around 300,000 that was a

00:31:56.330 --> 00:32:03.050
bit problematic for paleontologists but
recently because it's now easy to sequence

00:32:03.050 --> 00:32:08.150
the complete genome of parents and
children we can compare this genome. It

00:32:08.150 --> 00:32:14.740
has been possible to find that maybe the
rate of mutation assumed by this molecular

00:32:14.740 --> 00:32:23.270
clock was not quite right. New estimates
came with rate of mutation much more

00:32:23.270 --> 00:32:29.080
reduced about half of what was initially
thought. This new rate of mutation is

00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:35.080
confirmed by the study of some fossil
material. This is a female of early modern

00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:41.520
human found in western Siberia for which
we have the complete genome. We have the

00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:46.650
Beijing it's 45,000 years old so it's easy
to compare the genome of these early

00:32:46.650 --> 00:32:50.790
modern human who [inaudible 00:32:47]
and to have a notion of the rate of

00:32:50.790 --> 00:32:58.300
mutation along this lineage and it
confirms this reduced rate of mutation

00:32:58.300 --> 00:33:04.350
that has been recently proposed. It means
that the coalescence time for

00:33:04.350 --> 00:33:10.750
Neanderthals and modern humans fits rather
well this emergence in the phenotype, in

00:33:10.750 --> 00:33:18.500
the morphology around 400,000 or 450,000.
What has been going on in this time

00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:25.440
period? We have a list of features proper
to the Neanderthal that we see emerging

00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:33.810
through time by a process of accretion
and it's basically a shift in

00:33:33.810 --> 00:33:42.170
frequency of this features that we see
more and more a long time. About 200,000

00:33:42.170 --> 00:33:48.750
years ago in the Isotopic Stage 7 we have
basically reached the Neanderthal

00:33:48.750 --> 00:33:54.950
morphology completely. The story unfolds
between 450... I'm talking about

00:33:54.950 --> 00:34:02.750
morphology and let's say a little bit less
than 200,000. It goes at different speed

00:34:02.750 --> 00:34:09.470
depending on different anatomical [sp]
areas and we suspect one of the most

00:34:09.470 --> 00:34:15.610
mechanisms driving this evolution is not
adaptation, is not selection, it's

00:34:15.610 --> 00:34:23.760
something that genetists call drift and
this drift is mostly depending on

00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:30.520
demography. What is it about? It's simple
you have availability of a population in

00:34:30.520 --> 00:34:35.990
terms of genes and in terms of
morphological features. If you reduce the

00:34:35.990 --> 00:34:42.030
size of this population, if you reduce it
dramatically and then re-expand this

00:34:42.030 --> 00:34:47.430
population you're going to have again a
large population but with a reduced

00:34:47.430 --> 00:34:52.930
variability just by chance. Just because
only some of these features went through

00:34:52.930 --> 00:34:58.760
this bottleneck. We have something like
that with Neanderthals and along the

00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:05.170
Neanderthal lineage. I could go through
several features, cranial features, and

00:35:05.170 --> 00:35:09.710
facial features. I just pick up one
example which is what we call non-metrical

00:35:09.710 --> 00:35:17.050
dental features. These non-metrical dental
features have a frequency that increase

00:35:17.050 --> 00:35:21.460
along the Neanderthal lineage. We know
they are a part of the viability of

00:35:21.460 --> 00:35:27.790
Neanderthals of the middle places in
hominids before the Neanderthal emergence.

00:35:27.790 --> 00:35:34.500
This seems to be fixed a little bit my
chance in the Neanderthals and reach a

00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:42.510
very high frequency in later form. What
could drive this evolution? We think this

00:35:42.510 --> 00:35:49.770
jerky curve that you saw several
times already. In this period of time say

00:35:49.770 --> 00:35:58.630
around 800,000 to 400,000 become even more
jucky. We have 600,000 years ago for the

00:35:58.630 --> 00:36:05.660
first time the first major glacier episode
in western Eurasia. We think that this

00:36:05.660 --> 00:36:13.600
first major glacier episode resulted in
for the first time an isolation of western

00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:20.090
Eurasia and a dramatic reduction of
population living there. This is confirmed

00:36:20.090 --> 00:36:29.480
also now by paleogenetics using the high
resolution sequencing of Neanderthal and

00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:35.390
the use of a genome. It's possible to make
assumptions on the evolution of the

00:36:35.390 --> 00:36:40.640
population size through time of these guys
and we that contrary to what we have in

00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:46.700
the ancestral of modern humans. We have
around 500,000 to 600,000 dramatic

00:36:46.700 --> 00:36:53.150
reduction of the population size of this
group. The story unfolds this way. We have

00:36:53.150 --> 00:36:59.180
in the early places seen western Eurasian
hominids. We see a lot of the changes

00:36:59.180 --> 00:37:06.140
between southwest Asia, Africa, central
Asia, western Eurasia and with the

00:37:06.140 --> 00:37:11.820
Isotopic Stage 16 about 600,000 years we
have probably for the first time this

00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:17.880
separation time that matches the genetical
data. We have another major bottleneck

00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:24.500
with Isotopic Stage 12 and soon after this
is when we have for the first time

00:37:24.500 --> 00:37:32.460
Neanderthal features emerging in the
phenotype of European hominids. Let's say

00:37:32.460 --> 00:37:38.490
200,000 years later after a number of
other bottlenecks we have basically fixed

00:37:38.490 --> 00:37:46.140
this Neanderthal morphology. To finish I
would just like to say one word about

00:37:46.140 --> 00:37:53.400
Neanderthal extinction and I hope I
convinced you that climate played a major

00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:59.210
role in the life of the Neanderthals. The
question is did the climate play a role in

00:37:59.210 --> 00:38:06.320
the fall of the Neanderthals? There are a
number of theories about that that

00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:12.460
Neanderthals got extinct naturally before
modern humans moved into Europe. What we

00:38:12.460 --> 00:38:19.470
think about the emergence of modern humans
into Europe is a scenario that is a bit

00:38:19.470 --> 00:38:24.800
more complicated today that it was a few
years ago. We think we have two major

00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:30.140
episodes of colonization of western
Eurasia. Once corresponding to what we

00:38:30.140 --> 00:38:35.990
call the initial [inaudible 00:38:32]
sometime around maybe 48,000 and the later

00:38:35.990 --> 00:38:44.100
one for western of Eurasia around 42,000
to 43,000. It has been argued that in this

00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:49.210
time period the climatic curve is
especially jucky and that would have

00:38:49.210 --> 00:38:54.250
driven the Neanderthals to extinction
before or facilitated the replacement by

00:38:54.250 --> 00:39:01.290
modern humans. I think when you look at
discoveries it's very difficult to

00:39:01.290 --> 00:39:07.130
see I would say more jerkiness in this
period than before. I think Neanderthals

00:39:07.130 --> 00:39:12.920
survived all sort of climatic changes
before modern humans arrived in western

00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:19.730
Eurasia. I think the main disaster
Neanderthals had to face was not a

00:39:19.730 --> 00:39:24.855
climatic disaster. It was us.
Thank you.

00:39:35.346 --> 00:39:37.868
- [Potts] Now there are many
fundamental problems

00:39:37.868 --> 00:39:42.390
in the study of human evolution
and an immense array of

00:39:42.390 --> 00:39:50.150
really intriguing questions. In part
because the evolutionally journey has

00:39:50.150 --> 00:39:58.030
involved an astonishing transformation.
One way of looking at this transformation

00:39:58.030 --> 00:40:02.080
is through a pairing of slides. I thought
I would start with the laziest ones first

00:40:02.080 --> 00:40:07.920
but also the most endangering in some
ways. One way but it poses, this pairing

00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:14.370
of slides I'm going to show you, poses a
question. How is it that our ancestry

00:40:14.370 --> 00:40:20.990
included in an imaginative way in this
reconstruction dilemmas and survival

00:40:20.990 --> 00:40:28.780
challenges such as this? Then in our own
species that we can present ourselves with

00:40:28.780 --> 00:40:35.220
a survival challenge like this. How is
that kind of transformation even possible?

00:40:35.220 --> 00:40:43.230
Ed' White's space walk, the first human to
take a walk in space, and how was it if in

00:40:43.230 --> 00:40:48.830
fact evolutionally process tethered our
species through change over time. Tethered

00:40:48.830 --> 00:40:58.630
our species to human possibilities,
mentality and society to a particular

00:40:58.630 --> 00:41:04.340
ancestral habitat and to particular
conditions of life. How could that

00:41:04.340 --> 00:41:10.750
transformation have taken place? Another
pairing of slides I think capture this can

00:41:10.750 --> 00:41:18.200
be expressed in this way. The oldest know
stone tool tradition. The old one dating

00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:24.150
to about 2.6 million years ago. The
question that's posed here is how is it

00:41:24.150 --> 00:41:33.670
that our evolutionally journey and
technology go from something like this to

00:41:33.670 --> 00:41:39.800
something like this? As you can read there
this is space debris that is encircling

00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:47.700
the earth. As I write there the entire
planet has become an archaeological site.

00:41:47.700 --> 00:41:54.320
So in many different ways there are
species that resides on a human altered

00:41:54.320 --> 00:42:00.210
planet. In seeking to understand
transformation such as this we run right

00:42:00.210 --> 00:42:05.650
up against the fundamental scientific
challenge of seeing ourselves as a

00:42:05.650 --> 00:42:11.800
phenomenon of nature. And I think that
sadly the folkways in which we see

00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:18.160
our species are often seized in science
Homo sapiens almost as an aberration of

00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:23.880
nature and dichotomies. The traditional
dichotomies line up in a series of false

00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:34.390
oppositions human verses nature, cultural
verses natural, learning verses instincts,

00:42:34.390 --> 00:42:41.510
and even human verses animal. It's
especially that later dichotomy that

00:42:41.510 --> 00:42:48.020
highlights the fausted division that
occurs in this particular perspective. Now

00:42:48.020 --> 00:42:54.060
human evolution is the period that we've
been looking at so far in these first

00:42:54.060 --> 00:42:59.400
several talks. Namely the past six or
seven million years of earth's history.

00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:05.450
Where the baseline adaptations and the
initial possibilities of our species

00:43:05.450 --> 00:43:11.260
emerged in ancestors who are no longer
around. One way to pursue the question of

00:43:11.260 --> 00:43:15.930
how the accumulation of adaptations
occurred over time is to examine the

00:43:15.930 --> 00:43:22.570
environmental context of that entire time
period. Data like this which has been

00:43:22.570 --> 00:43:28.250
shown in the previous two talks and also
was shown on the front of your programs is

00:43:28.250 --> 00:43:36.160
the oxygen isotope curve showing changes
in the trends and fluctuation in ocean

00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:42.650
temperature and global ice volume. It's an
iconic diagram of parallel climatology and

00:43:42.650 --> 00:43:48.070
it shows that the past six million years
corresponding with a period of human

00:43:48.070 --> 00:43:53.080
evolutionally history have been one of the
most dramatic periods of climate

00:43:53.080 --> 00:44:00.410
oscillation of the Cenozoic Era of the
past 65 million years. As Peter Dominica

00:44:00.410 --> 00:44:07.590
showed in his talk, "Parallel climate
records" express at least two signals the

00:44:07.590 --> 00:44:14.040
overall trend as well as the variability.
And up to about I would say 20 years ago

00:44:14.040 --> 00:44:20.750
nearly every student in the study of human
evolution considered the variability as

00:44:20.750 --> 00:44:27.340
simply noise in the all important trend
toward a cooler and drier earth. It was

00:44:27.340 --> 00:44:34.180
the direction of change, the onset of
grassland dominated Savannah in East

00:44:34.180 --> 00:44:41.320
Africa or Africa in general and of ice age
conditions in higher latitudes. That was

00:44:41.320 --> 00:44:48.580
thought to be the signal that elicited the
emergence of uniquely human adaptations.

00:44:48.580 --> 00:44:53.820
Yet all of the environmental records also
show periods of strong instability of

00:44:53.820 --> 00:45:01.900
amplitude variations as there were
switches between arid and moist and

00:45:01.900 --> 00:45:08.640
between cool and warm. Now among many
factors that have an influence on earth's

00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:15.900
climate system earth's orbital dynamics
certainly are one of them as expressed in

00:45:15.900 --> 00:45:23.670
this figure. We live on a spinning planet
whose access of rotation is tilted and

00:45:23.670 --> 00:45:28.000
therefore there are variations,
fluctuations in the amount of solar

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:32.420
radiation that hits the earth at different
times of the year and at different places

00:45:32.420 --> 00:45:39.440
on earth. We see these three variables
represented here of eccentricity, the

00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:45.900
shape of the earth orbit around the sun,
the tilt of the earth axis also varies.

00:45:45.900 --> 00:45:50.050
Eccentricity the shape of the earth's
orbit the first factor goes from a more

00:45:50.050 --> 00:45:56.520
circular orbit to a more oval or
electrical orbit. The tilt of the earth's

00:45:56.520 --> 00:46:02.550
axis of rotation varies and also there is
this wobble in the earth's axis of

00:46:02.550 --> 00:46:10.520
rotation that relates to procession. When
you look at African climate and really

00:46:10.520 --> 00:46:15.560
climate all over the globe and African
climate is strongly influence by variation

00:46:15.560 --> 00:46:23.130
in solar insulation. Looking at two of
those variables it's the interaction of

00:46:23.130 --> 00:46:29.450
orbital procession which has cycles of
19,000 and 23,000 years approximately.

00:46:29.450 --> 00:46:35.120
Eccentricity, the shape of the earth's
orbit around the sun which has periods

00:46:35.120 --> 00:46:45.950
of about 100,000 years and about
413,000 years. You put those four wavy

00:46:45.950 --> 00:46:51.790
lines together, four basically sign curves
together and the interaction of them shows

00:46:51.790 --> 00:46:58.420
that there are this alternating phases of
high and low climate variability in

00:46:58.420 --> 00:47:04.410
tropical Africa. Peter Dominica has been
instrumental in helping me to understand

00:47:04.410 --> 00:47:10.320
this as we got together in a project a
number of years ago. So what we've been

00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:14.760
able to do and this is going to come out
in the publication soon is that we've been

00:47:14.760 --> 00:47:20.900
able to label according to very specific
intervals of changes between the high

00:47:20.900 --> 00:47:26.650
climate variability times and low climate
variability times of labeling back through

00:47:26.650 --> 00:47:32.490
time back over the last five million years
we've been able to do this. The highs and

00:47:32.490 --> 00:47:37.750
the lows. The times of strong instability
in East African climate where the aptitude

00:47:37.750 --> 00:47:44.680
of dry and wet were exacerbated, magnified
verses times of greater stability the low

00:47:44.680 --> 00:47:52.860
periods. What we've been able to show is
that the kinds of records that Peter has

00:47:52.860 --> 00:47:59.350
studied for example the dust records as
well as the wet dry cycles that are

00:47:59.350 --> 00:48:04.920
recorded in the Mediterranean are relating
to eastern and north east African climate

00:48:04.920 --> 00:48:10.020
support this alternation and this pattern
of division between high and low climate

00:48:10.020 --> 00:48:17.400
variability. The same paper that will come
out later this year also explores the

00:48:17.400 --> 00:48:24.209
places in East Africa where early humans
lived, where we find fossils and stone

00:48:24.209 --> 00:48:29.826
tools, do those also see fluctuations of
this sort. It turns out in that all

00:48:29.826 --> 00:48:34.481
of the really prolonged periods of high
climate variability we see also

00:48:34.481 --> 00:48:41.654
amplification in landscape variability in
East African sedimentary basins. For

00:48:41.654 --> 00:48:46.059
example this place with the almost
unpronounceable name of Olorgesailie in

00:48:46.059 --> 00:48:52.847
southern Kenya where I've been working for
the last 30 years we see that between

00:48:52.847 --> 00:49:00.114
350,000 and 50,000 years ago which was the
prolonged high labeled H2 in the previous

00:49:00.114 --> 00:49:05.693
diagram. That time period that we see the
landscape changing in amazing ways down

00:49:05.693 --> 00:49:10.631
cutting of the basin and then the basin
filling up with sediments compared with

00:49:10.631 --> 00:49:17.026
earlier in time. We think that these are
under climate control, these vast changes

00:49:17.026 --> 00:49:22.296
in landscape. We see this for all of the
other prolonged high variability

00:49:22.296 --> 00:49:30.200
intervals. I wondered whether in these
prolonged high variability intervals what

00:49:30.200 --> 00:49:33.254
happened? Was there anything interesting
that happened in human evolutionary

00:49:33.254 --> 00:49:38.843
history? You can see the time scale of
five million years on the left and what

00:49:38.843 --> 00:49:45.615
I've recorded here are the eight that is
the 25% longest periods of high climate

00:49:45.615 --> 00:49:51.040
variability and the numbers we've assigned
them in the paper to come out. And we

00:49:51.040 --> 00:49:55.532
thought what goes on here? What can we
tell from the fossils and archaeological

00:49:55.532 --> 00:49:59.246
records? It turns out that almost
everything that's interesting in African

00:49:59.246 --> 00:50:04.600
human evolution is concentrated in those
periods of high climate variability. FAD

00:50:04.600 --> 00:50:09.360
it's a strange word but it just means
First Appearance Datum where a fossil or

00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:14.790
an archaeological piece of evidence show
us the beginning of a particular lineage

00:50:14.790 --> 00:50:22.320
in our evolutionary tree or behavior. So
for Australopithecus of all the major

00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:27.170
genre in our evolutionally tree
Australopithecus and Homo and

00:50:27.170 --> 00:50:31.680
Paranthropists are concentrated in a
period of predicted high climate

00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:37.400
variability also that of Homo sapiens at
the top of the chart there. And also the

00:50:37.400 --> 00:50:43.170
origin of every single major technological
and behavioral transition in human

00:50:43.170 --> 00:50:48.680
evolutionary history is focused in one of
these prolonged high climate variability

00:50:48.680 --> 00:50:52.970
intervals. Now one thing that could be
easily criticized about this is that yeah

00:50:52.970 --> 00:50:57.120
but new fossils are found all the time and
they're going to be new find that are

00:50:57.120 --> 00:51:03.650
made. That happened about a month and a
half ago with a fossil jaw from Ethiopia

00:51:03.650 --> 00:51:10.600
that re-positioned of the genus homo. It
turns out it re-positioned it in the next

00:51:10.600 --> 00:51:16.210
in the oldest period of high climate
variability. Now I'm not saying that this

00:51:16.210 --> 00:51:22.420
is proof but it's nice to see a robust
predictive model about relationship of

00:51:22.420 --> 00:51:27.120
African human evolutionary history and
these periods of high climate variability.

00:51:27.120 --> 00:51:33.500
We'll see what happens next with the new
discoveries. We've also seen in our

00:51:33.500 --> 00:51:38.610
evolutionary tree we used to have the
march of hominids going from ape like to

00:51:38.610 --> 00:51:43.480
human like and that gave a sense of
inevitability about the existence of our

00:51:43.480 --> 00:51:49.590
species on earth. That idea has been
completely discarded and we see we are

00:51:49.590 --> 00:51:55.820
part of a much more diverse evolutionary
tree. In the context of environmental

00:51:55.820 --> 00:52:00.870
dynamics as the conditions of live change
with shifts in landscape and in food,

00:52:00.870 --> 00:52:06.670
water and shelter it makes sense that new
behavioral possibilities, new adaptations,

00:52:06.670 --> 00:52:12.940
and ways of life were at premium if they
could allow a greater degree of adjustment

00:52:12.940 --> 00:52:20.680
in this time periods of very strong
variability in the environment. This also

00:52:20.680 --> 00:52:26.740
means, since we're the last bipeds
standing, that other ways of life prior

00:52:26.740 --> 00:52:32.990
means of existence could not be sustained
and they were lost. in the light of

00:52:32.990 --> 00:52:38.850
environmental dynamics we can also inspect
this overview of the adaptive history

00:52:38.850 --> 00:52:44.820
related to the origin eventually of Homo
sapiens. We can now see these adaptations

00:52:44.820 --> 00:52:50.180
as the evolution of behavioral flexibility
and a wider range the development of a

00:52:50.180 --> 00:52:55.280
wider range of adoptive options and being
able to switch strategies essentially

00:52:55.280 --> 00:53:00.020
adaptability in the face of an unstable
world. I don't have time to go through all

00:53:00.020 --> 00:53:05.900
of these points certainly but we can point
out a few of them. For example things like

00:53:05.900 --> 00:53:12.790
a simple stone flaking, carrying of food
and stones across the landscape associated

00:53:12.790 --> 00:53:18.700
with the genus homo or ways of being able
to buffer the changing menu of food

00:53:18.700 --> 00:53:25.270
distribution and food abundance over time
during a high variability interval. The

00:53:25.270 --> 00:53:31.650
most rapid rate of increase in brain size
relative to body size. The brain is one

00:53:31.650 --> 00:53:38.040
our organ of plasticity and that also
becomes more understandable not as

00:53:38.040 --> 00:53:42.620
something that evolved in a specific
narrow set of environmental and survival

00:53:42.620 --> 00:53:48.600
conditions but in relationship to changing
circumstances. Increased cultural

00:53:48.600 --> 00:53:52.800
diversity and technological innovation
that of course is a characteristic of our

00:53:52.800 --> 00:54:01.360
own species and as multiplied the behavior
options within our own species. We also

00:54:01.360 --> 00:54:08.860
see in this chart the foundations for
human altered planet. For example the

00:54:08.860 --> 00:54:13.860
changes in technology, control of fire and
building of shelters even things like

00:54:13.860 --> 00:54:21.670
moving of complex moving of
resources across the landscape. We can see

00:54:21.670 --> 00:54:27.230
in the archaeological record and I will
talk more about that in a moment. What we

00:54:27.230 --> 00:54:33.470
see is that we have become very good at
surviving by modifying our surroundings

00:54:33.470 --> 00:54:40.250
and that humans as a result have spread
worldwide. Thus we have global change,

00:54:40.250 --> 00:54:46.140
global transformation of landscapes and
the consumption of resources even founded

00:54:46.140 --> 00:54:51.710
in this early evolutionary history of
human beings. My research team has been

00:54:51.710 --> 00:54:56.800
working towards the top of this time
period about 300,000 years ago and very

00:54:56.800 --> 00:55:02.640
quickly. These are some of the things that
were appearing in that period going back

00:55:02.640 --> 00:55:08.940
to 280,000 years ago and remember that's a
time period in Africa of prolonged high

00:55:08.940 --> 00:55:14.330
climate variability. We see the beginning
of innovations. We see increasing

00:55:14.330 --> 00:55:19.400
innovations, wider social networks, trade,
the beginning of awareness of groups that

00:55:19.400 --> 00:55:24.910
are distant far away that you cannot see
and yet you're able to have a sense of

00:55:24.910 --> 00:55:29.930
values, of valuable rock like obsidian
rock that was traded over long distance,

00:55:29.930 --> 00:55:34.610
complex symbolic activity, complex
thinking and planning. I would say this

00:55:34.610 --> 00:55:40.650
overall as in an environmental context
that we examine now Africa a greater

00:55:40.650 --> 00:55:45.040
capacity to adjust to new environments.
I'm not going to show you any more than

00:55:45.040 --> 00:55:49.170
that other than to say that our research
team is about to extend some of these

00:55:49.170 --> 00:55:56.290
traits even further back in time prior to
300,000 years ago. So what we then come up

00:55:56.290 --> 00:56:02.670
with is that the new theme and story and
the new theme and hallmark of our

00:56:02.670 --> 00:56:09.100
evolutionary story is one of adaptability
and increasing adaptability to endure

00:56:09.100 --> 00:56:13.760
change in the environment, to thrive in
novel environments, to spread to new

00:56:13.760 --> 00:56:19.180
habitats, to respond in new ways to the
surroundings. These are characteristics of

00:56:19.180 --> 00:56:26.240
the genus homo and especially embodied in
us Homo sapiens. Final thoughts. The long

00:56:26.240 --> 00:56:30.930
term view of human evolutionary history,
the idea of the inevitability of our

00:56:30.930 --> 00:56:36.250
species has been discarded; it's been I
think increasingly replaced by an emphasis

00:56:36.250 --> 00:56:42.040
on adaptability. When human evolution is
framed within the study of our pariah [sp]

00:56:42.040 --> 00:56:48.350
environments. Finally adaptability
according to the definitions that I just

00:56:48.350 --> 00:56:54.030
gave and the demise of ways of life has
been two sides of the evolutionary

00:56:54.030 --> 00:56:59.450
process. I think the question ahead for us
is that this is evolutionally history but

00:56:59.450 --> 00:57:03.909
in the cultural history that is now
unfolding will that still be the case.

00:57:03.909 --> 00:57:05.471
Thank you very much.
