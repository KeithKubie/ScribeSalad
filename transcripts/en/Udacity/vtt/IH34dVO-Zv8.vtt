We haven't covered this yet, but you might be wondering, what about zeros in

00:00:04.066 --> 00:00:08.249
fractions? How do they happen, and can they happen? Let's look at some squares

00:00:08.261 --> 00:00:12.154
to figure this out. Here, I have a square broken up into four equal pieces.

00:00:12.249 --> 00:00:14.178
Notice that none of them are shaded. That's okay.

00:00:14.189 --> 00:00:19.077
I can still have 0 out of 4. For fractions, the numerator tells us the number of

00:00:19.089 --> 00:00:23.023
equally sized pieces we have. The denominator tells us how many pieces our

00:00:23.035 --> 00:00:27.747
whole, in this case, our square is split in two. Notice that I have none of them

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:32.034
shaded. So, I have 0 out of 4. Since I have no pieces, it's really just 0, 0

00:00:32.046 --> 00:00:36.444
divided by 4 is 0. For this square, it doesn't make sense to split it up into

00:00:36.456 --> 00:00:40.961
zero pieces. I can't take a square and divide it by nothing. It just doesn't

00:00:40.973 --> 00:00:44.668
make sense. Fractions with zero in the denominator are undefined.
