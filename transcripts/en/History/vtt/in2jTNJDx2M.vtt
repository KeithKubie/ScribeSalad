00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:08.210
[music playing]

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:10.380
When you watch "Truck Night,"
you see all our start lines

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.500
and finish lines are
a nice black line,

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.620
and you're probably thinking,
how do they paint the dirt?

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:16.040
Well, we don't.

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.620
It's black woodchips,
is basically what it is.

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.920
MAN 2: Team comes out and
preps all the courses, perhaps

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:23.880
that green hill,
puts the chevrons,

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.880
puts the poles up, and
tries to make the courses

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:27.830
look as cool as they do.

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:32.880
MAN 1: And generally, after
somebody drives over it,

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.080
or finishes a race, or starts
the race, it's all torn up.

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.380
But here on the slag heap, it's
not torn up at all, because all

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:40.750
our contestants are loco.

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:50.880
And they jump the
finish line, over it.

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.920
So what is this place that we
film "Truck Night in America"

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.120
in?

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.920
It's actually a
working kaolin mine.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.540
This is kaolin.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.460
It's a strange, white,
kind of clay stuff.

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.790
[laughs] Gets everywhere,
I'll tell you that.

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:23.920
MAN 1: All right, drivers,
you're looking down the barrel

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.420
of 600 feet of kaolin.

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.580
When it's dry it's
like chalk dust,

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.120
but we've been hosing it down,
and it's slippery as ice.

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:36.120
DRIVER: Oh!

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.540
DRIVER: My god!

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.460
MAN 2: We use this
material for whiteout,

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.380
and also the kaolin climb.

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.290
When it has a little
bit of water on it,

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.120
it becomes very,
very, very slippery.

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.830
Come on.

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:50.670
Come on.

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:51.670
DRIVER: Oh, no!

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.170
MAN 1: It's that close, Bender!

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.620
MAN 2: And that's why you
see some of our drivers

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:00.420
struggling up something
that seems to be quite easy.

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.670
The kaolin I'm holding
my hand was formed

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.920
50 to 100 million years ago.

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.500
They traced the name back
to China, where the name

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.500
kaolin means high ridge.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.670
It is, in fact, the name of
a place, or a small village,

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.830
where kaolin was
first discovered.

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:18.960
MAN 1: He's not
going to make it.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:19.920
MAN 2: No, no!

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.420
He's so close!

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.120
We're in Georgia, and
kaolin is one of Georgia's

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.170
largest natural resources.

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.830
Oh-- Man, that is slippery.

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.380
So there you go, a little
bit about the kaolin mine

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.000
that we call home here at
Truck Night in America.

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.460
Unlike the real Stonehenge,
we call this Carhenge.

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.460
This is where you get your first
glimpse of the car graveyard.

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:56.120
MAN 3: It stands
twice as high, and has

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.880
twice as many cars as season.

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.830
It took 4 and 1/2 weeks
to build this monstrosity.

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:05.460
MAN 4: And we add new
cars after every show,

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:07.540
from all the victims
of the green hell.

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.380
MAN 3: He is stuck
on the car graveyard.

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.040
Oh, no.

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.380
Looks like the car graveyard
has claimed another victim.

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:18.250
Now, you gotta pick a solid
line here on the car graveyard.

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.040
If not, you'll slice a
time, or end up on your lid.

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.880
Don't roll it!

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.580
Oh, man.

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.750
And this thing's constantly
shifting every time we run it.

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.420
The weather can play
a big role here.

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.830
If it rains, these
hoods get extra slick.

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.880
But getting to the summit
means you're only halfway home.

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.750
Yeah, you got two
big holes coming up

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:43.500
in this thing you've
got to watch out for,

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.750
and an even bigger
one on the other side.

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.170
MAN 2: Only the best
drivers come up and over.

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.920
Yes!

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.920
Car graveyard.
