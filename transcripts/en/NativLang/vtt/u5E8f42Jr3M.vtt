In Mesopotamia. This is happening. The destruction of ancient treasures,

2
00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:09.940
even the leveling of entire cities by the self named Dolan Islamia.

3
00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:14.890
I think the reason this hurts us so much as something to do with language,

4
00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.820
we have much older artifacts we even know of older cities,

5
00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.990
but the people of Mesopotamia were the first to speak to us on their own terms

6
00:00:25.991 --> 00:00:29.470
in their own words, whose words for starters,

7
00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.370
simmer 5,500 years ago, the spoken wrote in [inaudible],

8
00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:37.090
Sumerian and isolate unrelated to surrounding languages.

9
00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:40.930
Even when the Acadians came in and took over 1200 years later,

10
00:00:40.931 --> 00:00:44.230
they kept Sumerian civilization going, Samir and Ising,

11
00:00:44.231 --> 00:00:47.950
their own words and culture as one linguist puts it on a massive scale.

12
00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.600
This amazingly early cultural transmission shaped ideas in the Middle East,

13
00:00:52.601 --> 00:00:56.920
in Europe at a time when most ancient languages have to be hypothesized.

14
00:00:56.921 --> 00:01:00.430
We know what the Mesopotamians had to say here.

15
00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:03.680
This is a city they called it Eddie do.

16
00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.620
This is how much barley every child and every adult should get 20 points for the

17
00:01:08.621 --> 00:01:10.810
kids, 30 to 40 for the grownups.

18
00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.990
This is a story they wrote about a giant flood.

19
00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.640
The first documented Semitic language wasn't written in Phoenician or the Hebrew

20
00:01:18.641 --> 00:01:21.970
alphabet. It was in cuneiform human.

21
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.350
The oldest into European texts were written in cuneiform. Now,

22
00:01:26.351 --> 00:01:28.570
I think country to what's gone around on the news.

23
00:01:28.571 --> 00:01:32.200
Cuneiform doesn't make Mesopotamia. Everyone's cradle of civilization.

24
00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.160
It's hard to see what kind of impact Sumeria could've had on China.

25
00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:40.570
And certainly the got all in the old mag in the Americas. We're a world away,

26
00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.310
but it was this act of writing early and extending its influence to later ages

27
00:01:45.311 --> 00:01:48.550
that causes us to connect with cuneiform civilizations,

28
00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.530
to hold them in such high regard and to stand horrified at people who confronted

29
00:01:53.531 --> 00:01:57.550
with that same influence feel. Not respect but hate.

30
00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.980
