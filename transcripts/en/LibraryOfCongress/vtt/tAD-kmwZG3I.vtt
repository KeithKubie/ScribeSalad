00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:22.600
&gt;&gt; Joan Weeks: [Foreign
language].

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:31.510
So, welcome to the Middle East--

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:35.060
African and Middle East
Division reading room.

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:36.750
On behalf of my colleagues

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.350
and in particular Dr. Mary-Jane
Deeb, chief of this division

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.160
who couldn't be with us today,

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.610
I'd like to extend a very
warm welcome to everyone.

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:46.910
I'm Joan Weeks.

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:48.950
I'm head of the Near
East Section,

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.770
the sponsor of today's program.

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:56.070
We are very pleased to present
this program entitled Snapshots

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.710
of Ottoman Women and it's
in celebration of March

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.670
at the Library of Congress
which is Women's History Month.

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.690
So, we look forward
to featuring programs

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:12.970
that highlight special
events concerning women--

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:14.940
women's history.

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.060
But before we start
today's program

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:18.360
and introduce our speaker,

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.230
I'd like to give you
just a brief overview

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:23.630
of our division and
the resources.

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.110
And I've got an agenda today.

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:31.520
All of my Turkish-speaking and
reading people that have come

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.830
to this program today, I
want to invite you in here

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.320
to use these collections,
read the latest novels.

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.640
When you go to travel
to Turkey and you happen

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.320
to be going anywhere
near Bursa, wouldn't you

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.960
like to have this
wonderful book,

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.960
before you do, all about Bursa?

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.580
Look at all the fantastic
pictures.

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:03.160
Everything you would need to
know and look at about Bursa.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.180
I'm going to set it
over here for people

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.450
to look at afterwards.

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.570
What if you're going to Izmir?

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:14.080
Well, here's everything
that you would

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.090
like to know statistically,

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.150
architecturally about
the buildings.

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.460
There is everything
about archeology,

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.680
how about romance novels?

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.410
Come on and read
the latest ones.

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.730
We've got newspaper,
microfilm those.

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.350
We've got all sorts of journals
and they're just waiting for you

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.300
to come in and use them.

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:40.710
And one of my favorite
new works is this,

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:45.650
all the wonderful artisans
in Istanbul, and there's all

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:50.030
of these poems in
Osmanli Turkcesi.

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:55.420
And then on the other side,
they're in modern Turkcesi.

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.420
And how nice you can--
I'm sort of very slow

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.810
at reading Ottoman Turkish.

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.810
So, what you can do is
look at the modern Turkish

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.950
and then figure it
out on the other side.

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.240
I love this side by side thing.

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.690
And I'd love to have you
come in and use these works,

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.010
and all you need to do
is search in our catalog.

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.490
You can get a reader
card on the first floor

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:21.260
and you can even request
the books ahead of time.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:22.560
So, they're waiting for you

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.170
in our reading room
when you come in.

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.780
And I hope you'll do that.

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.180
Other things, we are
a custodial division

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.620
and we have three sections
that serve the countries

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.820
and collections for
researchers around the world.

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:43.130
We cover over 78 countries
and over two dozen languages.

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:46.460
So we're very concentrated.

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:48.870
The Africa section
includes all the countries

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.230
of Sub-Sahara Africa.

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.570
Hebraic Section covers
Hebraic worldwide.

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:58.790
And the Near East Section
covers all of the Arab countries

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:02.830
in Northern Africa, the
Middle East, Turkey and all

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:07.000
of Turkic Central Asia,
Afghanistan, even the Muslims

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.490
of Western China, Balkans.

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:13.070
So, it's very, very
extensive holdings.

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:17.750
And I'd also like to invite
you to try out our blog written

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:20.360
by our curators and specialists.

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:26.070
And I also would like to invite
you to like our Facebook page,

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:27.870
because then you're
going to learn

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:29.840
about all our future programs

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:35.410
and really get connected
to us in a great way.

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:39.000
Also today, I invite your
questions at the end,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.410
but just be aware that
because we're webcasting this

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:44.760
for future broadcast,

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.930
you're kind of implicitly
giving your permission

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:52.300
to be videotaped in the program.

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:56.120
So without further ado,
I'd like to go ahead

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:59.420
and introduce our
speaker for today.

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:03.680
Betul Basaran received her
PhD in Near Eastern Languages

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:07.940
and Civilizations from the
University of Chicago in 2006.

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.790
And now, she's the associate
professor of Religious Studies

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:14.820
at St. Mary's College
in Maryland.

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:17.350
She is a historian of
the Islamic Middle East

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:21.390
and her primary area of
expertise, the social economic

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:26.380
and legal history of the Ottoman
Empire in the early modern era.

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:29.480
At St. Mary's College, she
teaches various courses

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:34.430
in the cross-disciplinary
areas of Asian studies, women,

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:39.470
gender and sexuality studies,
history and religious studies.

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:42.710
She uses an integrated
comprehensive approach

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:45.840
in her classes with an
emphasis on cultural--

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:49.540
cross-cultural encounters
between the Muslim world,

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:52.010
Europe and the Mediterranean.

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:55.690
She is the author of "Selim
III, Social Order and Policing

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:59.290
in Istanbul at the End
of the Eighteenth Century

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:02.600
between Crisis and Order"
and has published a number

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:04.790
of book chapters on the artisans

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:08.040
and populations of
Ottoman Istanbul.

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:11.860
She has also worked extensively
in the Ottoman Archives

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:15.700
and taught Ottoman language and
paleontology at the University

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:18.670
of Chicago and Georgetown
University.

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:22.420
Her latest project is on
urban space and mobility

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:24.250
with the focus on
the surveillance

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:26.550
of dangerous classes
of the Ottoman

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:29.840
and European cities,
very fascinating.

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:31.220
So without further ado, I'd

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:34.310
like to welcome Betul
Basaran to the podium.

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:36.110
Thank you.

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:41.350
[ Applause ]

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:42.650
&gt;&gt; Betul Basaran:
I'm really happy

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:44.260
and excited to be here today.

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:48.820
The Library of Congress
for historian

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:51.150
and a bookworm is a
fascinating place.

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:52.450
It's like a dream.

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:56.210
So, to be here talking to an
interested audience is amazing.

00:06:56.210 --> 00:07:00.460
And I'm also thrilled to see
some old friends and new friends

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:03.850
who are interested in
what I have to say today.

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:09.080
So, I want to say a few
things about myself first in--

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:12.450
before I start talking
about our topic today.

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:15.650
So, I was born and
raised in Turkey

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:17.930
in a very, very secular family.

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:23.420
And anything associated with
the Ottoman Empire or the Sharia

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:28.830
or Islam, these were not
passwords in my household.

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:33.660
My family, I would say had
high expectations for me.

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:37.470
I was sent to a private
American school.

00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:40.220
I did international
relations for my BA.

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:43.780
So, I was going to become this
great diplomat and bring peace

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:46.050
to the Middle East, solve the
crisis in the Middle East,

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:50.220
all of that, probably
working for a Western NGO

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:54.030
or the European Union or the
NATO or something like that.

00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:58.870
So when I told them I was
going to go into a PhD

00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:04.350
in Ottoman history, they were
not thrilled to say the least,

00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:06.920
especially when I became
interested in the sort

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:10.950
of workings of Sharia law
and Muslim Women's agency,

00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:14.810
things of that sort, it didn't
really make much sense to them.

00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:17.040
And the reason I
bring that up today is

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:20.270
because I really feel
very strongly that because

00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:25.440
of that modern Turkish
nationalist narrative,

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:31.330
the official narrative, plus the
orientalist European narrative,

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:36.300
those two things combined have
really had a pretty devastating

00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:40.240
impact on our understanding of
the nuances and complexities

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:43.790
of both Islamic and
Ottoman history.

00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:49.620
So, part of what I do in my
teaching and my research is try

00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:52.730
to really question that
and ask the questions

00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:56.620
that I really wasn't encouraged
to ask from a young age.

00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:59.450
So, I remember going
to Istanbul for--

00:08:59.450 --> 00:09:02.560
I grew up in Izmir on the
western coast of Turkey,

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:05.550
going to Istanbul for the
first time to visit some

00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:08.130
of the Ottoman monuments,
this is back

00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:12.110
when they didn't really have
good translations in science

00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:14.940
and either in modern
Turkish or in English.

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:18.130
And I just couldn't read
any of the Ottoman script

00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:20.190
on these amazing
buildings and monuments

00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:21.660
and fountains and mosques.

00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:22.960
I had no idea.

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:24.260
It was so bizarre.

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.890
It was like a schizophrenic
experience

00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:30.720
to go see these places where a
hundred years ago people spoke

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:33.820
or wrote in a different
language and read

00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:36.350
that stuff and knew what it was.

00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:38.830
So as a teenager, I was
intrigued but it wasn't

00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:40.850
until I went into
graduate school

00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:44.170
that I really started
asking the questions,

00:09:44.170 --> 00:09:50.950
especially about the way the
rhetoric about modernization

00:09:50.950 --> 00:09:53.310
in Turkey and Turkey's
secularization

00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:55.750
and modernization, the
way it's been presented

00:09:55.750 --> 00:10:00.510
as a phenomenon that's
been welcomed by all people

00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:02.030
of all classes and backgrounds

00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:04.290
as if there were no
nuances or complexities.

00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:08.090
So to ask the question--
questions about, well,

00:10:08.090 --> 00:10:09.830
how did this impact
other people?

00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:11.600
I know my family
really benefited

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:15.160
from these developments
and I had a great education

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:18.300
and I'm grateful for the legal
privileges and the equal rights

00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:21.200
that I have under the law,

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:23.770
but how did this impact other
people, what are different ways

00:10:23.770 --> 00:10:27.080
of thinking about this
history that happened in my 20s

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:29.640
which I think is kind of sad,

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:32.950
but better late than
never, I guess.

00:10:32.950 --> 00:10:39.830
So, that's how I came into
the study of things Ottoman.

00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:42.850
And so when I first read
the works of Fernand Braudel

00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:47.860
on the Mediterranean,
I was really sad

00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:53.040
to see him conceptualize the
Ottoman Empire as the antithesis

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:55.630
of everything European
and modern

00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:59.320
or as really anti-Europe
is what he calls it,

00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:05.980
and wanted to do some research
and gear my teaching toward how

00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:11.430
to study Mediterranean societies
and the Ottoman Empire as one

00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:15.550
and the-- or as partners
in this shared cultural

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:18.360
political environment.

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:21.800
So even though I would
argue, it's fair to say

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:24.950
that the Ottoman state,
Ottoman society was certainly

00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:29.870
distinctive, I would argue that
it wasn't exceptional either

00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:35.280
in its militarism, its
brutality, its religious fervor,

00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:37.550
or its misogyny or
patriarchy, right?

00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:42.880
So, there are ways in which
people in this geography

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:45.120
and especially women
since we're talking

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:50.710
about women shared a culture
of patriarchy regardless

00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:57.020
of religious difference in all
of these Abrahamic traditions.

00:11:57.020 --> 00:11:59.610
So, we have to think about
Ottoman women's experience

00:11:59.610 --> 00:12:01.980
within that broader context
and I'm going to try to do

00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:05.320
that as much as possible in
the rather short time period

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:09.710
that we have to the
best of my ability.

00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:17.230
So, let's start with
the Ottoman Empire.

00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:21.350
This is-- All right.

00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:24.080
So, there are some of
you here who know a lot

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:25.660
about the Ottoman
Empire already.

00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:28.730
So if this is repetitive,
I apologize.

00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:33.340
So, this is a map that
shows the Ottoman Empire

00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:35.370
around the beginning
of the 18th century

00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:39.600
at its sort of fullest borders.

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:45.430
And as many of you know,
the Ottoman Empire ended

00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:51.350
after World War I and the modern
Turkish Republic replaced it

00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:55.500
or inherited that legacy,
but that legacy is built

00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:58.800
on complete rejection
of everything Islamic

00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:03.070
and everything Ottoman
until fairly recently.

00:13:03.070 --> 00:13:06.970
So when we talk about Ottoman
subjects, we're talking

00:13:06.970 --> 00:13:08.300
about all of these people

00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:11.640
in this geography even
though my research focuses

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:14.250
on Istanbul more specifically.

00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:16.880
We have to remember that
this was a multi-religious,

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:19.880
multi ethnic empire.

00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:23.140
So, we're not just talking about
Muslim Ottomans, Muslim men

00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:26.730
and women, but we're
talking about Christian,

00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:29.840
Jewish and Muslim men and
women and we're talking

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:32.210
about free people and
enslaved people, right?

00:13:32.210 --> 00:13:34.570
There were also slaves
in-- on this geography.

00:13:34.570 --> 00:13:37.860
So, I'm going to try to-- really
my snapshots, this is an attempt

00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:42.410
to give you snapshots of
some examples, certainly not

00:13:42.410 --> 00:13:48.500
in any way all inclusive
or comprehensive.

00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:53.840
So, who are the Ottoman women
I'm going to try to talk about.

00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:58.890
As I said, I'm not going to
talk only about Muslim women.

00:13:58.890 --> 00:14:03.650
This is a picture from the 19th
century and clearly stage one

00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:07.690
from like a postcard, but
that shows a Jewish woman,

00:14:07.690 --> 00:14:10.200
a Bulgarian woman
and a Muslim woman.

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:15.500
The reason I start with
this picture is to remind us

00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:20.990
that the daily lives
and lifestyles of women

00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:24.800
until the modern era didn't
really differ a great deal,

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:26.100
right, in this geography.

00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:29.420
We tend to really create
these binaries between Muslims

00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:32.400
and everyone else, but
it's certainly historically

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:33.700
is inaccurate.

00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:41.380
Here is an Armenian peasant
woman from South Eastern Turkey.

00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:46.220
And I like that she's
smoking a cigarette.

00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:50.130
So, I had to-- I don't
know, she could do that.

00:14:50.130 --> 00:14:56.340
Here is how a Fazil
Enderuni in the 18th century,

00:14:56.340 --> 00:14:59.530
the person who illustrated
this manuscript,

00:14:59.530 --> 00:15:01.970
represented an Istanbul lady

00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:10.260
in the 18th century wearing
this special type of shoes.

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:14.070
So, that's one way, another way
to think about Ottoman women.

00:15:14.070 --> 00:15:17.200
And here is a-- from
the same work,

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:19.640
a scene of women just
chilling at this--

00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:22.240
in this garden at the
park and there are a lot

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:24.380
of different things
going on in this picture.

00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:28.150
So, I'll leave you with this
for a while as I proceed.

00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:32.920
But as-- like I said, I'm going
to give you some snapshots of--

00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:37.760
from the shared world of
Muslim and dhimmi or zimmi

00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:43.080
in Ottoman Turkish that is
non-Muslim protected peoples

00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:45.160
of the book, Jewish
and Christian women

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:47.920
and then both free
and slave women

00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:52.200
and their experiences
in the courts.

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:55.800
And since we're talking about
courts, it's important to start

00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:57.950
with a few things
about the legal system

00:15:57.950 --> 00:15:59.830
in the Ottoman Empire.

00:15:59.830 --> 00:16:06.500
Obviously, the Ottomans
created an empire that was--

00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:09.600
that had Islam as
its primary religion.

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:12.600
But as a multi-ethnic and
multi-religious empire,

00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:18.460
they had multiple legal systems
functioning in the empire

00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:22.340
that were to sort of
different purposes.

00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:28.210
So, the part of the legal system
that apply to Muslim subjects

00:16:28.210 --> 00:16:35.380
of the Empire came from-- or
was based on the dual systems

00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:39.780
of the Sharia or Islamic--
collection of Islamic principles

00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:46.730
and also what's known as the
Kanun, the sultanic secular laws

00:16:46.730 --> 00:16:50.380
and law codes that
were passed based

00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:53.050
on the authority of monarchs.

00:16:53.050 --> 00:16:57.780
And these two sets of laws
guided the legal system

00:16:57.780 --> 00:17:01.780
basically, but they were
meant to apply only in theory

00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:05.730
to Muslim subjects
of the empire.

00:17:05.730 --> 00:17:08.090
So, Christian and
Jewish subjects

00:17:08.090 --> 00:17:11.920
of the empire were not
subjected to the same laws.

00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:15.110
The Ottomans recognized these
groups as separate nations,

00:17:15.110 --> 00:17:18.830
millet is the Turkish
word used for it

00:17:18.830 --> 00:17:21.440
and they granted the
religious leaders

00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:24.360
of these groups very detailed

00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:28.160
and specific administrative
fiscal and legal powers.

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:32.260
So, they had authority to
adjudicate and hear cases

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:36.640
in their own courts to regulate
private and spiritual education,

00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:43.310
welfare, hospitals,
burials, cemeteries, clergy,

00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:48.030
their own clergy, maintenance
of their houses of worship,

00:17:48.030 --> 00:17:51.780
collection of taxes,
but also family law,

00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:54.140
so matters of inheritance,
marriage, divorce,

00:17:54.140 --> 00:18:03.230
custody plus any kind of sales,
sale of property, guardianships,

00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:04.990
dowries, things of that nature.

00:18:04.990 --> 00:18:08.990
So for all of these matters,
Jewish and Christian subjects

00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:11.790
of the Ottoman Empire
technically had

00:18:11.790 --> 00:18:13.690
to go to their own courts.

00:18:13.690 --> 00:18:18.590
And as you can imagine, the
clergy also wanted to keep it

00:18:18.590 --> 00:18:22.790
that way because it was
within their authority

00:18:22.790 --> 00:18:28.630
to oversee the proper
functioning of those systems.

00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:32.500
So within that broader
picture, let's talk a little bit

00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:37.190
about what kind of rights,
legal rights women had.

00:18:37.190 --> 00:18:40.420
I'm going to talk about
the Sharia courts mainly,

00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:42.680
Sharia and Kanun.

00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:45.560
But since we're going to
talk-- well, I choose--

00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:48.400
I chose to talk today
mainly about family law,

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:51.840
it's going to be mostly
Sharia principles rather

00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:54.040
than secular law codes.

00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:58.410
So, what kinds of
rights did women have?

00:18:58.410 --> 00:19:00.700
I would say that
although gender inequality

00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:04.830
and male dominance clearly
prevailed in Islamic family law

00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:07.770
and its application in
the Ottoman context,

00:19:07.770 --> 00:19:13.020
especially through man's right
to unilateral repudiation

00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:15.180
of marriage known as
talaq which I'll talk

00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:18.850
about a little bit
later, polygamy,

00:19:18.850 --> 00:19:20.990
concubinage for example.

00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:22.370
Despite these things, research

00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:24.960
on Ottoman family law
clearly suggests especially

00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:28.320
since the '70s, but more
so in the last two decades

00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:29.770
that Christian, Jewish

00:19:29.770 --> 00:19:33.470
and Muslim women all
used the Ottoman courts--

00:19:33.470 --> 00:19:36.350
the Sharia courts to
their advantage especially

00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:38.990
for economic transactions.

00:19:38.990 --> 00:19:40.970
They bought and sold property.

00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:44.250
They inherited and
passed on their wealth,

00:19:44.250 --> 00:19:48.940
established endowments, borrowed
and lent money and [inaudible]

00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:51.230
or partners in businesses.

00:19:51.230 --> 00:19:55.870
So, this literature has
really restored the agency

00:19:55.870 --> 00:20:04.140
of these women who had
previously appeared if at all

00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:08.640
as with one scholar has called
passive orientalist caricatures

00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:10.470
in the scholar literature.

00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:12.550
So, there has been
great enthusiasm

00:20:12.550 --> 00:20:16.810
in using these court records
to document women's agency.

00:20:16.810 --> 00:20:22.730
And some scholars have
taken this to argue that--

00:20:22.730 --> 00:20:27.420
to question the existence
of patriarchy

00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:28.720
in the Ottoman Empire.

00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:32.690
I wouldn't go as far as to
say that, but I would say

00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:35.910
that it's important to
recognize that women had--

00:20:35.910 --> 00:20:39.090
Muslim women had certainly
privileges that distinguish them

00:20:39.090 --> 00:20:42.430
from their counterparts
in most early European--

00:20:42.430 --> 00:20:45.550
early modern European
societies who liked many

00:20:45.550 --> 00:20:49.690
of the same rights,
especially in two areas,

00:20:49.690 --> 00:20:54.320
in property and marriage.

00:20:54.320 --> 00:21:00.040
And this is because women had
full legal rights as individuals

00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:03.950
which in certain fields were
indistinguishable from males.

00:21:03.950 --> 00:21:09.140
So for example in the types
of property they could inherit

00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:11.920
or in the management
of their property.

00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:15.300
Some of you probably
already know

00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:18.640
that there's a standard half
share of inheritance business

00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:22.070
in inheritance law, but
they regularly inherit it

00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:25.320
from both their own families
and in their marriages.

00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:26.760
And their rights in managing

00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:31.810
that property were
identical to male rights.

00:21:31.810 --> 00:21:34.670
So even though the law
and its application

00:21:34.670 --> 00:21:38.360
and its interpretation
clearly favored men over women,

00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:40.940
nevertheless women could seek
justice in the courts based

00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:44.780
on these legal rights
and seek justice.

00:21:44.780 --> 00:21:47.590
So just for comparison,
if we compare this

00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:54.070
to the Married Women's Property
Act, the various acts in 1870

00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:57.490
in the United Kingdom
and then in the mid 1800s

00:21:57.490 --> 00:22:02.980
in the United States, this is
just as a point of reference

00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:07.760
to highlight the fact that
legally, Muslim women,

00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:10.340
and in this case we're
talking about Ottoman women,

00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:15.550
had these rights that were their
inalienable rights for many,

00:22:15.550 --> 00:22:19.570
many centuries before
European women got them

00:22:19.570 --> 00:22:22.110
in the 19th century.

00:22:22.110 --> 00:22:25.200
So, this is from New York.

00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:28.520
New York's Married Women's
Property Act became a model

00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:32.010
for other states in that period.

00:22:32.010 --> 00:22:35.080
So, I really want to clarify
that my point here is not

00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:38.870
to compare one kind of
patriarchy over the other

00:22:38.870 --> 00:22:40.680
or to think about
which one is better.

00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:47.000
But rather, it is to highlight
the fact that patriarchy existed

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.820
and I'm interested in
how women used the courts

00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:53.450
to contest this patriarchal
gender religious hierarchy

00:22:53.450 --> 00:22:55.010
in the Ottoman Empire.

00:22:55.010 --> 00:22:56.920
So, one scholar,
Deniz Kandiyoti,

00:22:56.920 --> 00:23:00.010
has used the term
patriarchal bargain for this.

00:23:00.010 --> 00:23:03.180
So, women were literally
bargaining with the patriarchy

00:23:03.180 --> 00:23:11.360
to make it work for them, but
still working within the system.

00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:12.660
All right.

00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:19.550
So then in my snapshots today,
I decided to give you examples

00:23:19.550 --> 00:23:22.670
from three broad areas.

00:23:22.670 --> 00:23:25.130
One, some things
that I talk about,

00:23:25.130 --> 00:23:28.880
the women's economic activism
or financial activities

00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:35.120
in court briefly, then about
family law, mainly marriage--

00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:41.110
mainly divorce and remarriage,
and also matters of public order

00:23:41.110 --> 00:23:45.190
and the business
of expelling women

00:23:45.190 --> 00:23:51.520
from certain neighborhoods, so
literally just small snapshots.

00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:54.550
And I also want to
point out that

00:23:54.550 --> 00:24:00.770
as in other early modern cities
at the-- in the 18th century,

00:24:00.770 --> 00:24:03.340
poverty was rampant
in Ottoman Istanbul.

00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:06.760
So some of the women that
we encounter in the courts,

00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:10.700
we can assume that
they are middle class

00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:13.960
or have some access
to the courts.

00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:15.930
There was a very
highly developed culture

00:24:15.930 --> 00:24:17.230
of going to the court.

00:24:17.230 --> 00:24:18.920
Women knew about the courts.

00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:21.420
And there is this famous
saying that, you know,

00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:24.460
men couldn't stop women from
going to the court, going--

00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:25.810
and going to the hammam,

00:24:25.810 --> 00:24:27.300
basically to the
public bath, right?

00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:29.650
So, it was a legitimate
thing to do to go to court.

00:24:29.650 --> 00:24:33.590
Our understanding is that
court fees were not exorbitant.

00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:35.190
They were affordable.

00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:37.220
We also know that very--

00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:40.280
upper middle class and elite
families didn't typically go

00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:41.580
to courts.

00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:43.630
So, they try to resolve
matters among themselves,

00:24:43.630 --> 00:24:45.800
not to being shame
to the family.

00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:47.880
So, it was a last
resort for them.

00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:51.560
But the types of women who
regularly used the courts seem

00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:56.430
to be sort of middle
class urban women

00:24:56.430 --> 00:25:00.020
with some exemptions of course.

00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:02.530
All right.

00:25:02.530 --> 00:25:05.540
So when we look at women's
financial activities,

00:25:05.540 --> 00:25:11.860
we see again from these
records the use of court records

00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:15.150
that Ottoman women were quite
active in the urban economy

00:25:15.150 --> 00:25:23.010
of Istanbul as borrowers of
money, as lenders of money,

00:25:23.010 --> 00:25:26.090
as property owners,
buyers and sellers,

00:25:26.090 --> 00:25:27.810
founders of endowments
[inaudible].

00:25:27.810 --> 00:25:32.280
They were managers of businesses
and they were landladies.

00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:37.260
Middle class women were
very active in setting

00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:41.980
up these small charitable
family foundations

00:25:41.980 --> 00:25:46.790
that typically statistically
most often included residential

00:25:46.790 --> 00:25:52.080
units, fountains, hammams,
public baths and rental shops.

00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:54.910
They-- And they usually set up
their family members, husbands,

00:25:54.910 --> 00:25:58.090
but especially their children
and frequently their daughters

00:25:58.090 --> 00:26:00.670
and their slaves,
female slaves as their--

00:26:00.670 --> 00:26:06.750
as the beneficiaries of these
foundations, endowments,

00:26:06.750 --> 00:26:08.880
and managers of the endowments.

00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:13.060
And so, their wealth typically
came from two sources.

00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:16.810
I-- As I mentioned a little
while ago, part of it came

00:26:16.810 --> 00:26:20.880
from inheritance because
women had inheritance rights.

00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:23.710
So, they inherit it from
their own family members.

00:26:23.710 --> 00:26:26.720
And then another
source of wealth

00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:30.330
for women was upon marriage,
the dowry that they receive,

00:26:30.330 --> 00:26:32.760
that's part of their
marriage contract.

00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:39.980
So, a lot of women who had
sizeable wealth and by that,

00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:43.510
I don't mean necessarily
huge amounts of wealth,

00:26:43.510 --> 00:26:46.150
but large enough to
invest in something,

00:26:46.150 --> 00:26:48.140
took this money and
invested it in.

00:26:48.140 --> 00:26:52.690
So even though their wealth
came through passive means,

00:26:52.690 --> 00:26:56.520
if you will, so they weren't
going out and making money,

00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:58.860
they received it through
inheritance in marriage,

00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:03.710
they were active in
investing this money.

00:27:03.710 --> 00:27:08.360
We also see that they--
in addition to the courts,

00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:10.070
see these various
courts in Istanbul,

00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:12.570
they also used the
Imperial Council

00:27:12.570 --> 00:27:16.400
and they petitioned
directly to monarch for cases

00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:20.160
that weren't resolved within
the usual court procedures.

00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:25.480
And so, they took
their grievances

00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:30.380
to the monarch directly in this
process of bargaining in order

00:27:30.380 --> 00:27:33.150
to manipulate the
existing legal system

00:27:33.150 --> 00:27:36.640
to make it work better for them.

00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:40.200
But again, I want to sort
of qualify this by saying

00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:43.410
that I would not take
this as far as to suggest

00:27:43.410 --> 00:27:46.930
that this gave women complete
control of their lives.

00:27:46.930 --> 00:27:50.040
So, this activism in this
agency is very important,

00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:52.970
but we have to remember
the broader context.

00:27:52.970 --> 00:27:56.350
So, I wouldn't go as far as
saying that this activism

00:27:56.350 --> 00:28:00.720
in courts is a direct proof of
women's control of their lives.

00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:02.310
It is a huge privilege compared

00:28:02.310 --> 00:28:06.970
to other women around--
at the same time.

00:28:12.650 --> 00:28:17.390
So, women who are aware of these
advantages made it their regular

00:28:17.390 --> 00:28:18.690
business to go to the courts.

00:28:18.690 --> 00:28:20.230
And the courts were different

00:28:20.230 --> 00:28:24.990
than how we imagine the courts
today and that the qadi courts,

00:28:24.990 --> 00:28:27.560
the Sharia courts of the
Ottoman Empire worked also

00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:29.920
as a kind of public notary.

00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:32.690
So any kind of business contract
you have, you would take it

00:28:32.690 --> 00:28:36.680
to the magistrate or the judge,
the qadi to officiate, right,

00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:40.880
like I could enter a contract
with the neighbor for a rental,

00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:42.490
something or some
kind of arrangement.

00:28:42.490 --> 00:28:45.770
Without the qadi's seal, that
wouldn't be an official paper.

00:28:45.770 --> 00:28:47.730
So, there are all kinds of
things in these court records,

00:28:47.730 --> 00:28:51.820
not just criminal court
records for example.

00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:53.440
So, they can tell us about--

00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:54.740
a lot about the types

00:28:54.740 --> 00:28:58.480
of activities urban
women were involved in.

00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:05.340
When we move on to family
law, especially marriage,

00:29:05.340 --> 00:29:08.350
issues of marriage,
divorce and remarriage,

00:29:08.350 --> 00:29:13.760
let's look at what kinds
of rights the Sharia

00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:16.410
or Islamic principles-- and
the Ottomans follow the Hanafi

00:29:16.410 --> 00:29:21.460
School of Law, for those of
you who are knowledgeable

00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:26.600
of the different schools of
law in the Islamic context.

00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:32.110
So, Hanafi Law and Ottoman
application of the law specified

00:29:32.110 --> 00:29:35.100
that upon marriage contract,
the woman should receive a dowry

00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:38.440
from her husband, which then
became an inalienable part

00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:42.700
of her private property, legally
and technically untouchable

00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:47.580
by any male relative including
her husband once she had reached

00:29:47.580 --> 00:29:48.880
legal majority.

00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:52.040
So sometimes, marriages were
arranged before women reached

00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:54.850
puberty, and they had
the right to contest

00:29:54.850 --> 00:29:59.930
that arranged marriage
once they reached puberty.

00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:03.500
And there are many cases
in the court records

00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:08.570
where we see women come to
court, their husbands have gone,

00:30:08.570 --> 00:30:10.530
they're either missing
or they've gone--

00:30:10.530 --> 00:30:12.850
they've joined a military
campaign or they've gone

00:30:12.850 --> 00:30:14.470
on a business trip of some sort

00:30:14.470 --> 00:30:18.540
but they've been
gone for a long time.

00:30:18.540 --> 00:30:23.480
And so we see women
go to court in order

00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:26.570
to request the maintenance that
they're due from their husbands.

00:30:26.570 --> 00:30:28.380
There is actually
a daily maintenance

00:30:28.380 --> 00:30:33.330
that every woman is
legally entitled to.

00:30:33.330 --> 00:30:36.360
And if the husband fails to
pay that maintenance to her

00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:39.580
or provide that to her-- for
her, she can go to the judge

00:30:39.580 --> 00:30:44.400
and say this is not
happening and I need it.

00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:48.000
And in the cases when the
husband is either unable

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:52.000
to financially pay or
is away and missing

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:54.590
or for whatever reason
he's unable to pay,

00:30:54.590 --> 00:30:58.860
the courts grant the woman
the right to borrow that money

00:30:58.860 --> 00:31:00.200
on behalf of her husband.

00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:03.760
So she borrows money and her
husband is legally required

00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:05.060
to pay it back.

00:31:05.060 --> 00:31:07.490
All right, so we see
women do that a lot.

00:31:07.490 --> 00:31:09.530
There are a lot of
records of those.

00:31:09.530 --> 00:31:17.800
But also upon divorce or
abandonment, women are entitled

00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:21.820
to what's referred to as a
delayed portion of the dower

00:31:21.820 --> 00:31:27.430
of the marital gift, if
you will, that's hers.

00:31:27.430 --> 00:31:29.500
And so we see women go to court

00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:33.780
with their marriage
contracts asking the judge

00:31:33.780 --> 00:31:39.600
for the differed portion of
their dower upon divorce.

00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:44.130
So before I move on
to some examples,

00:31:44.130 --> 00:31:48.440
I want to make a few
additional points.

00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:53.270
So we see that in according
to Sharia principles,

00:31:53.270 --> 00:31:56.230
consent to marriage
is legally required.

00:31:56.230 --> 00:31:59.140
So the woman has the
right to contest it

00:31:59.140 --> 00:32:01.640
if for some reason she's been--

00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:04.160
either her marriage has been
arranged before she was legal --

00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:07.030
of legal age, which is puberty.

00:32:07.030 --> 00:32:11.600
Or for some reason she has
changed her mind and they were--

00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:14.020
even though men had
easier access to divorce,

00:32:14.020 --> 00:32:17.000
women had legitimate
reasons to ask for a divorce.

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.860
And we'll talk about a
few of those in a minute.

00:32:24.770 --> 00:32:28.990
So how many of you have heard
of the unilateral divorce

00:32:28.990 --> 00:32:32.110
in the Islamic law, talaq?

00:32:32.110 --> 00:32:35.050
A few people.

00:32:35.050 --> 00:32:38.570
So, in classical
Islamic Law, men--

00:32:38.570 --> 00:32:41.780
Muslim men have the right to
unilaterally divorce their wives

00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:45.820
without going to court
or providing the reason,

00:32:45.820 --> 00:32:47.800
a legitimate reason for it.

00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:49.960
Women don't have the same right.

00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:53.030
They have to proof-- they
bear the burden of proof.

00:32:53.030 --> 00:32:54.750
So they have to go
in court and prove

00:32:54.750 --> 00:32:58.410
that they have a legitimate
reason to ask for a divorce.

00:32:58.410 --> 00:33:00.710
So while a man can
say I divorce you,

00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:02.670
and there's a famous
triple formula,

00:33:02.670 --> 00:33:05.820
so if he says it three
times, that's a divorce

00:33:05.820 --> 00:33:08.730
and he is not required to go
register it in the courts.

00:33:08.730 --> 00:33:11.910
The only reason we know is
because women go to court

00:33:11.910 --> 00:33:16.720
and say he divorced me and
I need him to pay me either

00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:19.810
because of custody
issues or because

00:33:19.810 --> 00:33:23.520
of supporting her
and the children.

00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:25.870
So we only know through
women who go

00:33:25.870 --> 00:33:27.700
to court to contest it, right.

00:33:27.700 --> 00:33:30.790
So I'm interested-- I'm
more interested today

00:33:30.790 --> 00:33:35.090
in telling you about,
you know, what happens

00:33:35.090 --> 00:33:38.460
or under what circumstances
women could ask for a divorce

00:33:38.460 --> 00:33:41.110
and how the courts handle that,

00:33:41.110 --> 00:33:46.300
and again how women used the
courts to make the system work

00:33:46.300 --> 00:33:47.890
to the best of their advantage,

00:33:47.890 --> 00:33:50.780
under difficult circumstances,
obviously.

00:33:50.780 --> 00:33:54.920
So, a Muslim woman's
opportunities

00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:56.690
for seeking divorce
included first

00:33:56.690 --> 00:33:59.980
and foremost the stipulations
in their marriage contract.

00:33:59.980 --> 00:34:07.940
So any marriage that has been
recorded in the courts have

00:34:07.940 --> 00:34:10.770
to include a marriage contract.

00:34:10.770 --> 00:34:14.720
And oftentimes, women could
restrict the conditions

00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:17.410
in their contract under which
the husband could pronounce the

00:34:17.410 --> 00:34:18.710
unilateral divorce.

00:34:18.710 --> 00:34:20.740
So there are some
marriage contracts

00:34:20.740 --> 00:34:24.370
where the husband gives up
that right, for example,

00:34:24.370 --> 00:34:28.070
and it's written
in the contract.

00:34:28.070 --> 00:34:31.530
Or oftentimes there were
stipulations that said

00:34:31.530 --> 00:34:35.820
if he is missing or if he
is gone for so many number

00:34:35.820 --> 00:34:41.230
of years, then that's a
legitimate reason for a divorce.

00:34:41.230 --> 00:34:45.530
So disappearance,
abandonment, lack of support.

00:34:45.530 --> 00:34:49.430
So if a husband is not
sufficiently supporting his

00:34:49.430 --> 00:34:51.620
family, his wife-- this
is really about the wife,

00:34:51.620 --> 00:34:54.030
not the family as a whole,
children are not part

00:34:54.030 --> 00:34:57.830
of this picture that I am
talking about currently.

00:34:57.830 --> 00:35:02.090
Mental instability, so
madness is a specific category

00:35:02.090 --> 00:35:05.620
and there is a broad
category of harm, right.

00:35:05.620 --> 00:35:08.880
So if a woman could
prove in court

00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:12.220
that her husband is mentally
or physically abusing her

00:35:12.220 --> 00:35:15.710
or causing her harm, that's a
legitimate reason for a divorce.

00:35:15.710 --> 00:35:18.430
Of course how would
you prove that?

00:35:18.430 --> 00:35:22.630
That's the tricky part but
these are legal categories.

00:35:22.630 --> 00:35:24.500
Blasphemy is another
valid ground

00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:26.630
for annulling the marriage.

00:35:26.630 --> 00:35:30.230
But a very common scenario in
the court records is a story

00:35:30.230 --> 00:35:33.120
of missing husbands
and deserted wives.

00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:35.400
Like, so what happens
to these women

00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:39.980
when the husbands desert
them for various reasons?

00:35:39.980 --> 00:35:45.650
So the courts were prepared
to deal with this issue.

00:35:45.650 --> 00:35:48.640
Because when men disappeared,
most women were left

00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:50.210
without any resources, right.

00:35:50.210 --> 00:35:51.510
They might have a small--

00:35:51.510 --> 00:35:56.480
the lucky ones might have
a small amount of money.

00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:59.130
They might have invested in
something or collecting rent

00:35:59.130 --> 00:36:01.790
of some sort or maybe
working in some capacity

00:36:01.790 --> 00:36:07.820
but most women relied on
family resources for survival.

00:36:09.630 --> 00:36:17.730
Among divorce cases, the most
common form of termination,

00:36:17.730 --> 00:36:20.870
or a divorce that was
initiated by women,

00:36:20.870 --> 00:36:23.470
is what's called
a woman's divorce

00:36:23.470 --> 00:36:25.600
or a female-initiated divorce

00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:28.980
that involved the
woman's voluntary--

00:36:28.980 --> 00:36:35.250
the woman giving up her right to
the delayed portion of the dower

00:36:35.250 --> 00:36:38.240
that is by law owed
to her, right.

00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:43.600
So if she can't prove any other
legitimate reason for a divorce

00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:46.770
and the husband is not
consenting, then she can give

00:36:46.770 --> 00:36:49.760
up that chunk of
money that's owed her

00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:52.270
for support after divorce.

00:36:52.270 --> 00:36:56.260
So, in a way, she is buying
her husband's marital rights

00:36:56.260 --> 00:36:59.410
from him in return
for the divorce.

00:36:59.410 --> 00:37:03.830
So, again, scholars have
written quite a lot about this.

00:37:03.830 --> 00:37:07.100
My colleague Matt
[inaudible] who's at University

00:37:07.100 --> 00:37:09.680
of Maryland College Park here
has written about this type

00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:14.380
of divorce and it's questionable
to what extent this type

00:37:14.380 --> 00:37:16.950
of divorce was empowering
to women.

00:37:16.950 --> 00:37:18.250
Because on the one hand,

00:37:18.250 --> 00:37:21.410
it shows that the woman
could divorce her husband.

00:37:21.410 --> 00:37:25.050
And once he gives up that right,
it's almost automatic divorce.

00:37:25.050 --> 00:37:28.220
He doesn't have to deal with
anything, any of the messy parts

00:37:28.220 --> 00:37:29.890
of the divorce after that.

00:37:29.890 --> 00:37:32.720
But how many women could do
that, we can assume that women

00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:36.440
who had the financial resources
to support themselves could do

00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:40.480
that or had the networks, family
networks, or community networks.

00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:44.910
But we can assume that
a lot of women stayed

00:37:44.910 --> 00:37:47.960
in miserable marriages
because they couldn't do that.

00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:53.450
So it's-- the consequences
are complex.

00:37:53.450 --> 00:37:54.750
And when women did that,

00:37:54.750 --> 00:37:56.780
they also automatically
lost the custody

00:37:56.780 --> 00:37:58.380
of their children, right.

00:37:58.380 --> 00:37:59.680
So there was a lot at stake.

00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:01.200
On the one hand,
you have this right.

00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:04.130
But on the other hand,
it was complicated.

00:38:04.130 --> 00:38:07.670
So now let's look at
a couple of examples.

00:38:07.670 --> 00:38:09.850
We passed this.

00:38:09.850 --> 00:38:14.960
Oh, we're going the other way.

00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:21.390
Here. So, in this court case
from Ankara, we have a woman

00:38:21.390 --> 00:38:25.630
who goes to court
complaining that her--

00:38:25.630 --> 00:38:26.930
the inhabitants

00:38:26.930 --> 00:38:30.400
of her neighborhood are
preventing her from remarrying.

00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:33.380
And her husband allegedly
passed away four years ago.

00:38:33.380 --> 00:38:36.580
She's been told by
someone that he had died.

00:38:36.580 --> 00:38:40.360
And she wants to remarry which
is a very common scenario.

00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:44.470
It was pretty much on her
to-- for people to not marry,

00:38:44.470 --> 00:38:45.770
you know, Ottoman society.

00:38:45.770 --> 00:38:48.620
So everybody married and
remarried for the most part.

00:38:48.620 --> 00:38:51.310
Very few people married
only once from the records

00:38:51.310 --> 00:38:54.780
as far as we can tell.

00:38:54.780 --> 00:38:59.760
So he-- she's asking for
the right to be divorced

00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:04.050
so she can remarry in the
absence of her husband.

00:39:04.050 --> 00:39:05.960
And the court grants her wish.

00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:08.390
So she's divorced
from her husband

00:39:08.390 --> 00:39:09.690
and she's free to remarry.

00:39:09.690 --> 00:39:11.660
And the neighborhood
residents are told

00:39:11.660 --> 00:39:13.300
to leave her alone, basically.

00:39:13.300 --> 00:39:16.700
Now here is another case.

00:39:16.700 --> 00:39:21.440
Let's take a moment
to read and see

00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:24.320
if anybody can tell
me what is different

00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:25.620
between these two cases.

00:39:25.620 --> 00:39:29.450
They're very similar
but also different.

00:39:29.450 --> 00:39:34.160
Yeah. So we have a
Christian woman here.

00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:37.050
An Armenian.

00:39:37.050 --> 00:39:40.090
So what is she doing
at the qadi court?

00:39:40.090 --> 00:39:42.430
Why is she at the Sharia court?

00:39:44.060 --> 00:39:45.900
Right? Well, she's
supposed to go

00:39:45.900 --> 00:39:50.270
to her orthodox Christian
courts, they're there.

00:39:50.270 --> 00:39:52.080
And the law is specifying

00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:54.510
that she should go
to her own community.

00:39:54.510 --> 00:40:00.930
But it's actually really
common to see non-Muslim women

00:40:00.930 --> 00:40:04.740
in the Sharia courts, which
is intriguing and amazing.

00:40:04.740 --> 00:40:06.110
This is why we love history

00:40:06.110 --> 00:40:08.250
and this work is
like detective work.

00:40:08.250 --> 00:40:14.070
So why would non-Muslim women
go to the Islamic courts, right.

00:40:14.070 --> 00:40:17.470
So in this case, again, the
court decides in favor of her.

00:40:17.470 --> 00:40:19.870
And this is sort of
based on the Sharia

00:40:19.870 --> 00:40:21.940
and maybe some of the law codes.

00:40:21.940 --> 00:40:24.880
But technically speaking,
there is this nice division

00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:29.440
between different
religious communities, right.

00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:33.580
In fact, going to the
Sharia courts were so common

00:40:33.580 --> 00:40:35.310
that in Istanbul the patriarchs

00:40:35.310 --> 00:40:37.550
in both the Greek
Orthodox Armenian

00:40:37.550 --> 00:40:42.070
and Jewish communities
periodically petitioned the

00:40:42.070 --> 00:40:47.340
Ottoman Palace and religious
dignitaries to stop it

00:40:47.340 --> 00:40:50.230
from happening because
they want to have control

00:40:50.230 --> 00:40:51.850
over their own communities so--

00:40:51.850 --> 00:40:55.590
and they kept going
to the Sharia courts.

00:40:55.590 --> 00:40:59.210
So, I mean some of the
reasons are obvious

00:40:59.210 --> 00:41:02.890
because from what we know, and I
have to say, I haven't ever done

00:41:02.890 --> 00:41:04.260
in the research in the courts--

00:41:04.260 --> 00:41:06.240
court records of
those communities.

00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:08.800
So this is from secondary
literature.

00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:11.750
But Orthodox Christian law,
when a marriage was annulled,

00:41:11.750 --> 00:41:15.310
the husband did not return to
his wife the premarital donation

00:41:15.310 --> 00:41:16.990
or the drahoma, given

00:41:16.990 --> 00:41:22.530
by the prospective bride's
family to the groom.

00:41:22.530 --> 00:41:25.270
And Jewish women had to get
from their husbands a bill

00:41:25.270 --> 00:41:29.180
of divorce, again, that only
the husband could issue.

00:41:29.180 --> 00:41:32.900
But by comparison Muslim
women-- in the Islamic courts,

00:41:32.900 --> 00:41:34.200
women had some options.

00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:37.990
So there were more options
in the Islamic courts.

00:41:37.990 --> 00:41:41.720
And so because of this, we
see that non-Muslim women went

00:41:41.720 --> 00:41:43.640
to the courts to
register their marriages

00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:46.070
so that they could go back
when something happened and ask

00:41:46.070 --> 00:41:49.680
for a divorce in
the court as well.

00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:52.950
So I really don't know about
the applicability of this

00:41:52.950 --> 00:41:56.920
in other Islamic Sharia courts,
but I know it happened regularly

00:41:56.920 --> 00:41:58.490
in the Ottoman Empire in places

00:41:58.490 --> 00:42:00.700
like Damascus, in
Aleppo and Cairo.

00:42:00.700 --> 00:42:04.810
This is not just in Istanbul.

00:42:04.810 --> 00:42:16.940
But again, at this point, I
want to say that my goal is not

00:42:16.940 --> 00:42:20.460
to make a statement about which
type of law was more impressive

00:42:20.460 --> 00:42:22.280
or more patriarchal,
whether Jewish

00:42:22.280 --> 00:42:25.990
or the Christian Law was more
repressive than Islamic Law.

00:42:25.990 --> 00:42:27.340
But rather, my point is

00:42:27.340 --> 00:42:29.620
that these women
shared a common culture,

00:42:29.620 --> 00:42:32.690
a common patriarchal culture
which did not easily allow them

00:42:32.690 --> 00:42:36.220
to divorce or remarry, right,
whatever religion they were.

00:42:36.220 --> 00:42:41.320
But the Islamic courts gave
them some extra options.

00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:45.270
All right, another
example of grounds

00:42:45.270 --> 00:42:48.620
for divorce is impotence.

00:42:48.620 --> 00:42:50.470
So the sexual incompetence

00:42:50.470 --> 00:42:53.030
of the husband is
a legitimate ground

00:42:53.030 --> 00:42:56.730
for a divorce in Sharia law.

00:42:56.730 --> 00:42:59.830
Again, there is the issue of
in the absence of medical--

00:42:59.830 --> 00:43:03.460
modern medicine, like how do
you prove that, what do you do,

00:43:03.460 --> 00:43:05.380
or how long do you wait?

00:43:05.380 --> 00:43:09.000
There are very clear
instructions

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:14.200
in Sharia principles that
talk about a woman finding

00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:16.650
out on the first day or
night of their marriage

00:43:16.650 --> 00:43:22.170
that the husband some kind
of hideous deforming disease

00:43:22.170 --> 00:43:25.290
or is incapable of
having an erection,

00:43:25.290 --> 00:43:29.400
or that something terribly
goes wrong on that first day.

00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:31.120
So the woman has the right to go

00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:32.970
to court immediately
to report that.

00:43:32.970 --> 00:43:35.730
And there are records
of it in the courts.

00:43:35.730 --> 00:43:40.180
But more broadly, we also
have evidence of, you know,

00:43:40.180 --> 00:43:44.720
women going to court and
oftentimes the judge grants

00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:46.020
like a waiting period.

00:43:46.020 --> 00:43:48.930
Like he gives like a year or
something and says like work

00:43:48.930 --> 00:43:52.260
on it, it's probably, I'm not
sure but there is a period.

00:43:52.260 --> 00:43:55.920
And then within that period, if
the marriage is not consummated,

00:43:55.920 --> 00:43:57.770
then the woman gets the divorce

00:43:57.770 --> 00:44:02.420
because there was a
basic understanding

00:44:02.420 --> 00:44:06.330
of the basic rights, basic
conditions or exigencies

00:44:06.330 --> 00:44:09.880
of civic life, right, that
everybody was entitled to.

00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:12.610
And these categories refer
to the servants of God

00:44:12.610 --> 00:44:17.150
in Ottoman Sharia law and it
included non-Muslims, right.

00:44:17.150 --> 00:44:21.410
So everybody is entitled
to life property progeny.

00:44:21.410 --> 00:44:23.380
So, if you're not
consummating your marriage

00:44:23.380 --> 00:44:26.210
and that's a violation
of your basic rights

00:44:26.210 --> 00:44:30.580
and the judge grants
you a divorce.

00:44:30.580 --> 00:44:33.800
So at this point, in fact the--

00:44:33.800 --> 00:44:41.160
this image that I used in a
flyer is an interesting one.

00:44:41.160 --> 00:44:45.780
So this is a woman in court
complaining about her husband.

00:44:45.780 --> 00:44:52.110
And she has some perhaps family
members, perhaps neighbors,

00:44:52.110 --> 00:44:57.060
we don't know and
complaining to the judge.

00:44:57.060 --> 00:45:00.630
We-- Maybe she also wants a
divorce so she can remarry.

00:45:00.630 --> 00:45:02.570
We don't have that information.

00:45:02.570 --> 00:45:05.820
And-- But what's interesting

00:45:05.820 --> 00:45:08.640
about this is the judge
is holding something

00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:10.080
and I don't think
there are any minors

00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:12.250
in the room so I can say it.

00:45:12.250 --> 00:45:14.860
He's holding a dildo.

00:45:14.860 --> 00:45:17.930
The Ottoman word is
[inaudible], right.

00:45:17.930 --> 00:45:20.970
So she's holding
or he's holding--

00:45:20.970 --> 00:45:26.880
So she has presented as
evidence to the judge.

00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:30.120
As evidence of her
husband's impotence.

00:45:30.120 --> 00:45:36.170
Or, this is-- again, this
is not in the court records.

00:45:36.170 --> 00:45:37.620
This is a miniature painting

00:45:37.620 --> 00:45:39.950
that represents the
goings about in the court.

00:45:39.950 --> 00:45:44.380
But I would say, hypothesize,
it sort of represents

00:45:44.380 --> 00:45:49.430
in a satirical manner, perhaps
male anxieties about women going

00:45:49.430 --> 00:45:52.660
to court and asking
for a divorce

00:45:52.660 --> 00:45:56.140
or perhaps humiliating
the husband.

00:45:56.140 --> 00:45:59.720
I have never seen a court
record that actually talks

00:45:59.720 --> 00:46:01.020
about the [inaudible] as--

00:46:01.020 --> 00:46:05.550
So I don't know if the
artist was inspired

00:46:05.550 --> 00:46:08.790
by an actual record or not.

00:46:08.790 --> 00:46:10.500
But we know that
women went to court

00:46:10.500 --> 00:46:13.030
to prove their husbands'
impotence

00:46:13.030 --> 00:46:15.970
and asked for divorces.

00:46:15.970 --> 00:46:18.310
All right, any questions so far?

00:46:18.310 --> 00:46:23.590
Can I take questions a little
or shall we wait, Joan?

00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:26.020
[Inaudible] OK.

00:46:26.020 --> 00:46:30.800
So let me try to get through.

00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:32.470
[Inaudible] OK.

00:46:32.470 --> 00:46:36.340
All right then we'll move on.

00:46:36.340 --> 00:46:39.540
So the next thing I want to
talk about was conversion.

00:46:39.540 --> 00:46:43.690
So non-Muslim women went through
the item in Sharia courts

00:46:43.690 --> 00:46:47.440
to make use of these legal
privileges, but also many

00:46:47.440 --> 00:46:49.450
of them converted
to Islam as a way

00:46:49.450 --> 00:46:53.560
of gaining even more
privilege in this society.

00:46:53.560 --> 00:47:00.240
As you're reading this,
Marc Baer in his study

00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:05.900
of the 17th century writes
that between 1650 and 1700

00:47:05.900 --> 00:47:09.670
in Istanbul, hundreds of free
mostly enslaved Christian

00:47:09.670 --> 00:47:13.220
and Jewish women converted
to Islam and not necessarily

00:47:13.220 --> 00:47:16.430
because of marriage, because
they wanted to marry a Muslim

00:47:16.430 --> 00:47:19.900
but for complicated reasons.

00:47:19.900 --> 00:47:22.270
So for non-Muslim
women converting

00:47:22.270 --> 00:47:25.950
to Islam offered an escape from
what may be more unbearable

00:47:25.950 --> 00:47:29.400
or more patriarchal depending
on the context situations

00:47:29.400 --> 00:47:32.230
in their own communities.

00:47:32.230 --> 00:47:36.940
And conversion also gave them
the custody of their children.

00:47:36.940 --> 00:47:40.700
So if a non-Muslim woman
went to court and converted,

00:47:40.700 --> 00:47:44.410
not only was she immediately
divorced from her husband

00:47:44.410 --> 00:47:47.270
but she also immediately gained
the custody of her children

00:47:47.270 --> 00:47:52.970
to raise them as Muslim children
which was otherwise complicated.

00:47:57.920 --> 00:48:02.570
So there were certain privileges
to conversion obviously.

00:48:02.570 --> 00:48:04.860
But again, what I
want to highlight,

00:48:04.860 --> 00:48:08.200
I agree with my colleague
Marc Baer, that this was a way

00:48:08.200 --> 00:48:12.670
for women to opt out of one
type of patriarchal system

00:48:12.670 --> 00:48:16.430
into another one that in some
ways gave them more options

00:48:16.430 --> 00:48:20.460
but nevertheless also sustained
and recreated this patriarchy

00:48:20.460 --> 00:48:21.760
over and over again, right.

00:48:21.760 --> 00:48:25.590
Because they're opting into a
system that in some ways better

00:48:25.590 --> 00:48:30.670
in this context but did
not challenge the working

00:48:30.670 --> 00:48:33.360
of the patriarchal system.

00:48:33.360 --> 00:48:42.300
And then there were also
slave women who converted.

00:48:42.300 --> 00:48:49.850
And I would say that in
a-- in an Islamic empire,

00:48:49.850 --> 00:48:54.970
a multiethnic, multireligious
Islamic empire, slave--

00:48:54.970 --> 00:48:57.780
non-Muslim slaves were
at the very bottom

00:48:57.780 --> 00:48:59.100
of the hierarchy, right.

00:48:59.100 --> 00:49:02.050
So a non-Muslim slave
woman had the most to gain

00:49:02.050 --> 00:49:05.540
from conversion, right,
because of certain things.

00:49:05.540 --> 00:49:11.870
So, one, when a non-Muslim
slave converted,

00:49:11.870 --> 00:49:14.390
she could not any
longer be or he--

00:49:14.390 --> 00:49:16.790
I'm talking mainly about
women, so I can say she--

00:49:16.790 --> 00:49:19.010
she could not any
longer be owned

00:49:19.010 --> 00:49:22.870
by a non-Muslim slave
owner, right.

00:49:22.870 --> 00:49:29.090
So if I convert as a slave
to Islam and I have a Jewish

00:49:29.090 --> 00:49:32.400
or a Christian owner, then
the authorities have the right

00:49:32.400 --> 00:49:36.780
to come and take me from
his position to make sure

00:49:36.780 --> 00:49:40.010
that I'm going to be
owned by a Muslim family.

00:49:40.010 --> 00:49:43.330
So that would be-- And that
tended to be the kind of thing

00:49:43.330 --> 00:49:46.080
that Muslim elites
like to do, right.

00:49:46.080 --> 00:49:50.210
So to sort of bring into
your household a newly--

00:49:50.210 --> 00:49:55.360
a new convert into a Muslim
household was almost understood

00:49:55.360 --> 00:49:58.500
as a good act of
good faith, right.

00:49:58.500 --> 00:50:03.390
So that gave women an
opportunity to go from maybe

00:50:03.390 --> 00:50:08.320
of a commoner to an elite
Muslim household, right.

00:50:08.320 --> 00:50:11.170
But of course also, the best
thing that could happen was

00:50:11.170 --> 00:50:15.070
for a woman, a slave woman
who converted to Islam

00:50:15.070 --> 00:50:20.430
to marry her master and
bear children for him.

00:50:20.430 --> 00:50:26.230
When a slave woman had
children with free Muslim men,

00:50:26.230 --> 00:50:29.850
her children were
born slate free.

00:50:29.850 --> 00:50:31.840
They were now born into slavery.

00:50:31.840 --> 00:50:34.830
And in many cases, the
owners could free the

00:50:34.830 --> 00:50:36.130
woman immediately.

00:50:36.130 --> 00:50:39.090
But if they did not do
that, when the owner died,

00:50:39.090 --> 00:50:41.970
the slave automatically
became free, right,

00:50:41.970 --> 00:50:45.490
without any contestation.

00:50:45.490 --> 00:50:48.630
So-- And not only that, but
she became an equal heir

00:50:48.630 --> 00:50:49.930
to his estate.

00:50:49.930 --> 00:50:54.960
So not only did her children
inherit equal shares as children

00:50:54.960 --> 00:50:57.170
from other marriages,
but she also inherited

00:50:57.170 --> 00:51:00.070
as an equal wife
in that marriage.

00:51:00.070 --> 00:51:03.640
So we see a lot of such
records in the courts,

00:51:03.640 --> 00:51:10.320
former slaves going to court
to do paperwork for inheritance

00:51:10.320 --> 00:51:14.490
and division of certain shares
of estates and so forth.

00:51:14.490 --> 00:51:19.570
Yeah, so here is one account
that I wanted to put up here.

00:51:19.570 --> 00:51:23.370
I'm going to go quickly
through this now.

00:51:23.370 --> 00:51:28.060
Here's an account of
a record in the courts

00:51:28.060 --> 00:51:30.860
for a woman being freed
after having children.

00:51:30.860 --> 00:51:39.860
The last type of thing I want to
bring up is the issue of women--

00:51:39.860 --> 00:51:43.190
another way that women
we're very vulnerable living

00:51:43.190 --> 00:51:46.050
in neighborhoods, especially
women who lived on their own.

00:51:46.050 --> 00:51:49.440
So this could be women who
were widowed or divorced

00:51:49.440 --> 00:51:53.570
or for some other reason lived
alone which would be rare.

00:51:53.570 --> 00:51:58.650
But Ottoman government
and society in the absence

00:51:58.650 --> 00:52:01.130
of modern police institutions

00:52:01.130 --> 00:52:08.640
until the 19th century
used community policing

00:52:08.640 --> 00:52:12.480
like community watches to police
themselves as small communities.

00:52:12.480 --> 00:52:16.140
So it was everybody
else's business to spy

00:52:16.140 --> 00:52:18.400
on everybody else basically.

00:52:18.400 --> 00:52:20.570
It was very functional in some
ways which, you can imagine,

00:52:20.570 --> 00:52:23.520
it put women and people
who were marginalized

00:52:23.520 --> 00:52:25.380
in a vulnerable position.

00:52:25.380 --> 00:52:28.510
So my own research for
my own book research,

00:52:28.510 --> 00:52:30.080
I work with some
of these records.

00:52:30.080 --> 00:52:34.010
I was interested in
matters of public order

00:52:34.010 --> 00:52:35.780
and disorder in neighborhoods.

00:52:35.780 --> 00:52:38.200
And my research in
the court records show

00:52:38.200 --> 00:52:42.150
that this was the most
common type of complaint

00:52:42.150 --> 00:52:45.330
about public order in
neighborhoods, that is,

00:52:45.330 --> 00:52:47.480
a group of residents

00:52:47.480 --> 00:52:50.030
in the neighborhood get
together, they go to the qadi.

00:52:50.030 --> 00:52:52.470
They're usually the imam
and religious leaders

00:52:52.470 --> 00:52:55.360
of the neighborhood are
with them and they complain

00:52:55.360 --> 00:52:59.580
about a group of women
or entire families.

00:52:59.580 --> 00:53:04.480
And basically the language used
in the records is very sort

00:53:04.480 --> 00:53:07.640
of standardized probably
not the language

00:53:07.640 --> 00:53:11.770
that the petitioners
use themselves.

00:53:11.770 --> 00:53:17.750
But they found-- they
claimed that people were unfit

00:53:17.750 --> 00:53:21.260
to live among them because
of various criminal behavior

00:53:21.260 --> 00:53:22.810
or bad morals.

00:53:22.810 --> 00:53:24.300
They didn't mind
their own business.

00:53:24.300 --> 00:53:26.570
They didn't live
a righteous life.

00:53:26.570 --> 00:53:31.230
For women, the accusations
were usually

00:53:31.230 --> 00:53:35.580
about being disruptive
or dishonest.

00:53:35.580 --> 00:53:39.300
This is probably a cover
up for not being virtuous.

00:53:39.300 --> 00:53:43.790
For improper dress,
being verbally abusive,

00:53:43.790 --> 00:53:48.880
using offensive language,
receiving unidentified men

00:53:48.880 --> 00:53:53.290
and women in their residences,
disregarding multiple warning,

00:53:53.290 --> 00:53:56.560
so there was a warning system
but disregarding these warnings,

00:53:56.560 --> 00:54:03.380
and making such deeds-- misdeeds
a habit, so habitual behavior.

00:54:03.380 --> 00:54:06.980
And in all of these cases,
and here is one example,

00:54:06.980 --> 00:54:09.480
the accused allegedly
disrupted peace and order

00:54:09.480 --> 00:54:10.780
in the neighborhood

00:54:10.780 --> 00:54:17.940
so the residents did not want
them in that neighborhood.

00:54:17.940 --> 00:54:20.440
And I have to stress
here that many times

00:54:20.440 --> 00:54:24.440
in these records women
also appear as petitioners.

00:54:24.440 --> 00:54:28.350
So women we can say were also
the watchdogs of their sisters.

00:54:28.350 --> 00:54:31.540
So it wasn't just men spying
on women or men trying

00:54:31.540 --> 00:54:32.840
to get women expelled.

00:54:32.840 --> 00:54:35.340
There were often a lot of
women in the groups as well.

00:54:35.340 --> 00:54:36.640
And these groups were mixed.

00:54:36.640 --> 00:54:38.360
A lot of Ottoman
neighborhoods were mixed.

00:54:38.360 --> 00:54:42.260
So Muslim and non-Muslim races
would come together to ask

00:54:42.260 --> 00:54:45.810
for the expulsion
of certain people.

00:54:45.810 --> 00:54:50.780
I think I had a number
of examples

00:54:50.780 --> 00:54:53.550
but this is again a scene.

00:54:53.550 --> 00:54:58.060
It's entitled from the same
work as the "Brothel at Night"

00:54:58.060 --> 00:55:02.660
but they could just as well be
curious neighbors questioning

00:55:02.660 --> 00:55:05.180
the integrity of these women
who really, if they were

00:55:05.180 --> 00:55:06.740
on their own, didn't
really have a lot

00:55:06.740 --> 00:55:11.170
of ways socially acceptable
ways to defend themselves.

00:55:11.170 --> 00:55:15.130
So in this picture, you can
see there are some Janissaries

00:55:15.130 --> 00:55:17.220
who worked, were
usually like the police.

00:55:17.220 --> 00:55:19.940
So the imam probably
receives a complaint

00:55:19.940 --> 00:55:23.260
and he goes knocking
on the door.

00:55:23.260 --> 00:55:26.240
But even in these
cases where allegedly

00:55:26.240 --> 00:55:30.060
in this case Fatma
Hatun was caught

00:55:30.060 --> 00:55:31.870
with them indecently, right.

00:55:31.870 --> 00:55:35.130
This is really sort of
covered up language, right.

00:55:35.130 --> 00:55:39.290
That could be a cover up for
an accusation for prostitution.

00:55:39.290 --> 00:55:41.250
And it was really stunning
to see in the records

00:55:41.250 --> 00:55:42.550
that the accusations

00:55:42.550 --> 00:55:46.100
for prostitution directly
are almost nonexistent.

00:55:46.100 --> 00:55:47.950
Instead, you see
these bad morals

00:55:47.950 --> 00:55:49.250
and we don't want them here.

00:55:49.250 --> 00:55:52.810
So the question of what
happens to these women comes up.

00:55:52.810 --> 00:55:55.330
There is no way of tracing
them unless they come back

00:55:55.330 --> 00:55:57.970
to court to ask for something.

00:55:57.970 --> 00:56:03.170
So there are cases where--
I believe I have one here.

00:56:03.170 --> 00:56:05.920
Yeah, so in this case--

00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:16.990
In this one, they say
they leave immediately.

00:56:16.990 --> 00:56:25.330
In this one, three
years has-- had past.

00:56:25.330 --> 00:56:31.430
So a group of residents went
to court and got a warrant,

00:56:31.430 --> 00:56:34.010
if you will, an order for
these women to be expelled

00:56:34.010 --> 00:56:35.310
from the neighborhood.

00:56:35.310 --> 00:56:37.200
And then three years
later, they go back

00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:39.390
to court saying they're
still here.

00:56:39.390 --> 00:56:42.170
We came to court three years
ago, you said they would go.

00:56:42.170 --> 00:56:47.490
So there's-- my point here is
that until modern nation states,

00:56:47.490 --> 00:56:49.850
the state itself had
very little power

00:56:49.850 --> 00:56:52.680
over the implementation
of communal matters.

00:56:52.680 --> 00:56:56.380
So in a way, as annoying
as a spy might have been,

00:56:56.380 --> 00:57:00.910
local communities had a
lot of autonomy compared

00:57:00.910 --> 00:57:04.920
to how our governments sort of
know everything about us today

00:57:04.920 --> 00:57:06.380
and police us and control us.

00:57:06.380 --> 00:57:07.930
Well, in terms of
implementation,

00:57:07.930 --> 00:57:11.920
it was up to the community to
make sure that those people--

00:57:11.920 --> 00:57:15.630
my time is up-- that
those people left, right.

00:57:15.630 --> 00:57:19.160
So in most cases, we don't
know where people went,

00:57:19.160 --> 00:57:20.460
where these women went.

00:57:20.460 --> 00:57:22.730
There is some research that
shows that they just move--

00:57:22.730 --> 00:57:26.200
went to the neighborhood,
one neighborhood down.

00:57:26.200 --> 00:57:28.450
They didn't go very
far, they weren't exiled

00:57:28.450 --> 00:57:31.560
or they weren't punished
for their behavior.

00:57:31.560 --> 00:57:35.560
In fact, there's
research on prostitution

00:57:35.560 --> 00:57:38.770
in the Ottoman Empire
both from the Arab lands

00:57:38.770 --> 00:57:41.620
and in Turkish parts
of the Empire show

00:57:41.620 --> 00:57:45.210
that increasingly they were
being banished in this way.

00:57:45.210 --> 00:57:49.570
But the state wasn't even
outlawing prostitution based

00:57:49.570 --> 00:57:52.740
on immorality, they just
wanted to get this people

00:57:52.740 --> 00:57:54.870
out of the public's
sight, if you will, right.

00:57:54.870 --> 00:57:57.690
So there's this Arabic term
they use, tathir, right,

00:57:57.690 --> 00:58:02.370
to sort of cleanse the filth,
but make it invisible rather

00:58:02.370 --> 00:58:04.970
than stopping the deed itself.

00:58:04.970 --> 00:58:06.950
So women just went to
different neighborhoods.

00:58:06.950 --> 00:58:08.980
They were traveling from
one place to another.

00:58:08.980 --> 00:58:10.660
And we really don't know enough

00:58:10.660 --> 00:58:15.880
to know the real
implications of that for women.

00:58:15.880 --> 00:58:19.950
So I want to leave
on-- So, you know,

00:58:19.950 --> 00:58:22.390
a good note for women's agency.

00:58:22.390 --> 00:58:25.930
There were also a lot of women
like Serife Hatun in this case,

00:58:25.930 --> 00:58:28.220
who challenged the courts.

00:58:28.220 --> 00:58:32.030
You know, this-- she-- there was
a similar accusation about her

00:58:32.030 --> 00:58:36.760
and people thought she had
strangers in her dwellings.

00:58:36.760 --> 00:58:38.790
And then they came and
that was not the case.

00:58:38.790 --> 00:58:41.660
So she went to court and said
these people have shamed me

00:58:41.660 --> 00:58:45.590
publicly, so I want compensation
for that and she got it, right.

00:58:45.590 --> 00:58:48.690
So she challenged it and got
monetary compensation for it.

00:58:48.690 --> 00:58:53.550
And I want to end
with some images

00:58:53.550 --> 00:58:57.300
of Ottoman women
later 20th century.

00:58:57.300 --> 00:59:00.870
But as the Ottoman Empire
was transitioning, again,

00:59:00.870 --> 00:59:03.740
my point really has been
that this was a shared world

00:59:03.740 --> 00:59:07.590
for Muslim and non-Muslim
women under the Ottoman Empire.

00:59:07.590 --> 00:59:10.940
The same women started founding,
starting women's organizations

00:59:10.940 --> 00:59:13.130
in the 19th and 20th centuries.

00:59:13.130 --> 00:59:17.440
So this group, that included
Muslim and non-Muslim women,

00:59:17.440 --> 00:59:18.890
founded this association.

00:59:18.890 --> 00:59:23.040
And you see there's a plane,
a propeller in the background.

00:59:23.040 --> 00:59:25.530
They raised the money for
this plane and they bought it

00:59:25.530 --> 00:59:27.130
and they flew it themselves.

00:59:27.130 --> 00:59:30.130
They've been asking for
the permission to do it,

00:59:30.130 --> 00:59:32.450
nobody wanted to give them
permission or train then.

00:59:32.450 --> 00:59:34.920
So they raised the
money and did it anyway.

00:59:34.920 --> 00:59:38.630
And they distributed
fliers over Istanbul

00:59:38.630 --> 00:59:43.440
to publicize their
organization for women's rights.

00:59:43.440 --> 00:59:45.480
They founded this one
of the famous journals,

00:59:45.480 --> 00:59:48.270
women's journals, again
Muslim and non-Muslim women.

00:59:48.270 --> 00:59:57.160
And I'm going to leave you with
this my Turkish suffragists,

00:59:57.160 --> 01:00:02.040
right, who campaigned for
universal suffrage in Turkey.

01:00:02.040 --> 01:00:06.080
And they got in 1930 the
rights for local elections

01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:09.500
and then 1934 is when Turkish
women got universal suffrage.

01:00:09.500 --> 01:00:13.600
That's fairly early
compared to the global trend.

01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:18.330
So these Ottoman women
together achieved a lot things

01:00:18.330 --> 01:00:20.940
and I would argue that
it's a mistake to see them

01:00:20.940 --> 01:00:23.510
as separate entities and
communities in a binary way

01:00:23.510 --> 01:00:26.480
that we tend to do today
when it comes to Muslims.

01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:28.830
Thank you very much for your
patience I think now we can

01:00:28.830 --> 01:00:30.190
take questions.

01:00:30.190 --> 01:00:31.490
Thank you.

01:00:31.490 --> 01:00:32.790
[Applause].

01:00:32.790 --> 01:00:36.070
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much
for such an awesome--

01:00:36.070 --> 01:00:38.490
&gt;&gt; A little over my
time but I hope it's OK.

01:00:38.490 --> 01:00:40.190
&gt;&gt; I have about one
or two questions.

01:00:40.190 --> 01:00:41.800
We are running a little short.

01:00:41.800 --> 01:00:44.400
We like to reopen the reading
room to our researchers

01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:48.510
but does somebody
have a question?

01:00:48.510 --> 01:00:54.250
[ Inaudible ]

01:00:54.250 --> 01:00:56.930
&gt;&gt; No, you represented yourself.

01:00:56.930 --> 01:01:00.880
And women were sometimes
represented by male relatives

01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:04.380
or you could hire somebody
like-- or you could designate,

01:01:04.380 --> 01:01:07.210
not hire, designate but you
didn't have to spend thousands

01:01:07.210 --> 01:01:09.960
of dollars to get an
attorney to represent you.

01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:13.540
No, it was face to face, direct.

01:01:13.540 --> 01:01:15.340
Yes, ma'am.

01:01:15.340 --> 01:02:32.030
[ Inaudible ]

01:02:32.030 --> 01:02:33.940
I'm afraid I'm going
to disappoint you

01:02:33.940 --> 01:02:36.140
and say I'm not really sure.

01:02:36.140 --> 01:02:39.380
I really-- I haven't
studied the Arab provinces

01:02:39.380 --> 01:02:40.970
of the Ottoman Empire
well enough

01:02:40.970 --> 01:02:43.430
to really give you an idea.

01:02:43.430 --> 01:02:47.710
But I know that in nomadic--
among nomadic groups,

01:02:47.710 --> 01:02:50.800
there was resistance to
settle down and being taxed

01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:53.720
by the government because
there were different rules

01:02:53.720 --> 01:02:55.300
about taxation if you
weren't moving around.

01:02:55.300 --> 01:03:03.170
Maybe it was resistance to
being a French citizen rather

01:03:03.170 --> 01:03:04.930
than being a part of the--

01:03:04.930 --> 01:03:06.380
But are you saying
they were not part

01:03:06.380 --> 01:03:07.680
of the Ottoman Jewish
Millets when they were--

01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:09.480
before the French came?

01:03:09.480 --> 01:03:41.120
[ Inaudible ]

01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:43.510
Out of it, I understand.

01:03:43.510 --> 01:04:05.120
[ Inaudible ]

01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:07.260
Very interesting.

01:04:07.260 --> 01:04:09.310
I'm sorry, I don't know either.

01:04:09.310 --> 01:04:10.660
Can we take one more?

01:04:10.660 --> 01:04:12.510
&gt;&gt; Just one more.

01:04:12.510 --> 01:04:23.300
[ Inaudible ]

01:04:23.300 --> 01:04:28.680
Yes, it was binding.

01:04:28.680 --> 01:04:29.980
[Inaudible] It does

01:04:29.980 --> 01:04:34.370
so the Ottoman Law did not
require non-Muslims to go there.

01:04:34.370 --> 01:04:36.400
Non-Muslims would go to
the Sharia court only

01:04:36.400 --> 01:04:40.590
if they had a conflict with a
Muslim subject of the Empire

01:04:40.590 --> 01:04:44.290
about money or business
or whatever.

01:04:44.290 --> 01:04:46.370
And neighbors fought
a lot, so they went

01:04:46.370 --> 01:04:47.670
to the court all the time.

01:04:47.670 --> 01:04:49.820
But if a Muslim was not
involved, they didn't--

01:04:49.820 --> 01:04:52.000
they have no obligation
to go to the Sharia court.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.390
But when they did, they went
and turned around and told

01:04:54.390 --> 01:04:56.360
to go to their own court.

01:04:56.360 --> 01:04:59.760
So if they came on
their own initiative,

01:04:59.760 --> 01:05:05.160
the court granted them the
same rights they granted

01:05:05.160 --> 01:05:06.470
Muslim women.

01:05:06.470 --> 01:05:07.840
[Inaudible] So what
the rejection was

01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:11.300
from the patriarchs we need
to do something about this

01:05:11.300 --> 01:05:14.650
because our people are going to
your courts instead of coming

01:05:14.650 --> 01:05:20.840
to us and they were losing power
within their own communities.

01:05:20.840 --> 01:05:22.640
Thank you very much.

01:05:22.640 --> 01:05:29.190
[ Inaudible ]

01:05:29.190 --> 01:05:31.160
Thank you.

01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:34.110
