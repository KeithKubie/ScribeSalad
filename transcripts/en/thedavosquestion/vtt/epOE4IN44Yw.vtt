00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.590
&gt;&gt; Hello.
Mexico will be hosting the conference of the

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:08.570
party 16, COP 16, in
Cancun this December.

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:14.599
And we are -- we want to learn from the mistake
we made in Copenhagen

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:18.359
really.
We are trying to bring all together, all the

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.280
countries to the table.
We want to hear all the voices.

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:26.480
We want to understand all the interest, in
order to reach a real

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:33.039
consistent, robust agreement.
Tackle climate change.

00:00:33.039 --> 00:00:39.580
The evidence coming from the academia researching
is overwhelming.

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:45.980
And today all the problems that we have associated
with climate change

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.989
are effecting the lives of common citizens
around the world.

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:54.039
In order to tackle climate change, we need
to work together.

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:57.960
And we need to understand different the point
of view, the different

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.780
concerns, different interests.
Not only by developed but also developing

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.490
countries.
What we need to do is to build an economic

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.580
framework in order to start
the right economic incentives to motive and

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.430
stimulate the participation
of all countries and governments tackling

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:24.720
climate change.
So what we want to do is to put in actions

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:32.549
the response [INAUDIBLE] and
in order to under the result-based principles,

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.770
start to work against
climate change.

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.329
Many in the developing countries, we can do
a lot of things.

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:43.710
We in Mexico are working really hard in terms
of preventing

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:51.670
deforestation, reforestation areas.
We are reducing unilaterally our emissions

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.250
15 million stone by 2012
year.

00:01:53.250 --> 00:02:01.560
And we have a commitment of 30 percent of
reduction from business as

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:07.060
usual by the year 2020, and 50 percent by
the year 2050.

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.480
So we are working with other countries.
We are organizing the COP 16.

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.630
It will be very difficult to reach agreement.
We must do that.

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:21.730
We have no more time to wait for the world.
We will be waiting for you in Cancun.

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.940
Please give us all the support coming from
the civil society, NGOs in

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:33.770
order to get new momentum and get a very successful
meeting of COP 16

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.300
in Cancun, Mexico.
Thank you.
