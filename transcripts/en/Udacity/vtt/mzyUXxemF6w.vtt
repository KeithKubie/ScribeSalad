00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.030
Once you've checked off these tasks, I've got these questions for you.

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:07.440
There's a library being used whose name starts with a U,

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.250
what's that library called?

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:12.070
What's the name of the organizational library being used to

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:13.770
separate our concerns?

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:16.219
How many views do you see in this application?

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:19.460
And this last question, isn't a question, it's a statement.

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.590
Only check this check box, when you do feel comfortable moving on.

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:26.450
If you need to play with the application more, do it.

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:29.450
If you need to explore the file structure or look at what java script files

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:31.630
are loaded, or figuring out what these libraries do.

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.900
If you need to do any of that, do it now, before you move on.

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.270
Once you do move on, I'll go through these, and I'll tell you what I see.
