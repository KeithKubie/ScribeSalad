sitting in takes up look at the
 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.250
sitting in takes up look at the
footprint of an automobile and see how

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:10.260
footprint of an automobile and see how
 

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.040
footprint of an automobile and see how
large that footprint is the automobile

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050
large that footprint is the automobile

incrementally tweak the automobile you

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650
incrementally tweak the automobile you
 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.620
incrementally tweak the automobile you
can make the you know the powertrain

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630
can make the you know the powertrain
 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.240
can make the you know the powertrain
more efficient and you can enhance

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250
more efficient and you can enhance
 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.070
more efficient and you can enhance

they're very worthwhile but what we are

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940
they're very worthwhile but what we are
 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.820
they're very worthwhile but what we are
concerned about is stepping right back

concerned about is stepping right back
 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.190
concerned about is stepping right back
and say can you fundamentally rethink

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200
and say can you fundamentally rethink
 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.440
and say can you fundamentally rethink
the whole idea can you really begin to

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450
the whole idea can you really begin to
 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.530
the whole idea can you really begin to
think of urban personal mobility in

totally different terms that are
fundamentally more sustainable

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070
fundamentally more sustainable
 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.229
fundamentally more sustainable
fundamentally more equitable how

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239

fundamentally more equitable how
fundamentally better for the planet

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620
fundamentally better for the planet
 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.290
fundamentally better for the planet
that's what we're trying to do so we're

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300
that's what we're trying to do so we're
 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:07.910
that's what we're trying to do so we're
not working within the framework I mean

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920
not working within the framework I mean
 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.590
not working within the framework I mean
incremental tweaking but we're working

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600
incremental tweaking but we're working
 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.479
incremental tweaking but we're working
within the framework of fundamental

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440
 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.760
well so the way that we work always is

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:19.770
well so the way that we work always is
 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:25.760
well so the way that we work always is
by trying to identify the fundamental

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:25.770
by trying to identify the fundamental
 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:27.740
by trying to identify the fundamental
underlying design assumptions that

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750
underlying design assumptions that
 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.990
underlying design assumptions that
everybody takes as given and

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000
everybody takes as given and
 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.050
everybody takes as given and
challengeable when you think about

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060
challengeable when you think about
 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.280
challengeable when you think about
solving these problems and we try and

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290
solving these problems and we try and
 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.260
solving these problems and we try and
challenge those assumptions so for

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:36.270
challenge those assumptions so for
 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:39.110
challenge those assumptions so for
example everybody thinks an automobile

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120
example everybody thinks an automobile
 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.000
example everybody thinks an automobile
needs an engine well ultimately little

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010
needs an engine well ultimately little
 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.250
needs an engine well ultimately little
doesn't necessarily need an engine what

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260
doesn't necessarily need an engine what
 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.790
doesn't necessarily need an engine what
we do is shift electric motors into the

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:46.800
we do is shift electric motors into the
 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.310
we do is shift electric motors into the
wheels of our automobiles and so we have

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320
wheels of our automobiles and so we have
 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.050
wheels of our automobiles and so we have
a completely different kind of thing

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060
a completely different kind of thing
 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.550
a completely different kind of thing
where we have four independent

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560
where we have four independent
 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.280
where we have four independent
intelligent wheels rather than a you

know a traditional internal combustion

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720
know a traditional internal combustion
 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.440
know a traditional internal combustion
engine and powertrain and so on so we do

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450
engine and powertrain and so on so we do
 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:08.960
engine and powertrain and so on so we do
that and then we try to make products

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970
that and then we try to make products
 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:13.700
that and then we try to make products
and systems with solutions to the

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:13.710
and systems with solutions to the
 

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:16.310
and systems with solutions to the
problems that we're trying to solve that

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320
problems that we're trying to solve that
 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.310
problems that we're trying to solve that
are not only good technical solutions

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320
are not only good technical solutions
 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.560
are not only good technical solutions
but engage people's imagination and

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570
but engage people's imagination and

mobility there are several components to

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:02.360
mobility there are several components to
 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.080
mobility there are several components to
the system so what one component is the

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.090
the system so what one component is the
 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:07.059
the system so what one component is the
vehicle what what's the vehicle like is

00:05:07.059 --> 00:05:07.069
vehicle what what's the vehicle like is
 

00:05:07.069 --> 00:05:09.300

scooter is it some other kind of device
and so part of what we've been doing is

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:14.500
and so part of what we've been doing is
 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:17.469
and so part of what we've been doing is
reinventing the vehicle so looking at

00:05:17.469 --> 00:05:17.479
reinventing the vehicle so looking at
 

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:20.170
reinventing the vehicle so looking at

another component of the system is the
the energy supply system how do you get

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:29.630
the energy supply system how do you get
 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:31.480
the energy supply system how do you get
energy to these things and so

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:31.490
energy to these things and so
 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:33.219
energy to these things and so
traditional way of doing this is

00:05:33.219 --> 00:05:33.229
traditional way of doing this is
 

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:35.620
traditional way of doing this is
distribute gasoline around the city what

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:35.630
distribute gasoline around the city what
 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:37.559
distribute gasoline around the city what
we've been looking at of course is

00:05:37.559 --> 00:05:37.569
we've been looking at of course is
 

00:05:37.569 --> 00:05:40.270

do you gain access to vehicles when and
 

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:50.469
do you gain access to vehicles when and
where you need them and what do you do

00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:50.479
where you need them and what do you do
 

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:52.210
where you need them and what do you do
with them when you're not using them and

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:18.890
final destination from there we can
demonstrate that we get with this sort

00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:18.900
demonstrate that we get with this sort
 

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:20.869
demonstrate that we get with this sort
of system we can get much better

00:07:20.869 --> 00:07:20.879
of system we can get much better
 

00:07:20.879 --> 00:07:24.619

can get with the private automobile

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:28.470
can get with the private automobile
 

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:31.129
can get with the private automobile
let's suppose that advantage of the

00:07:31.129 --> 00:07:31.139
let's suppose that advantage of the
 

00:07:31.139 --> 00:07:32.960
let's suppose that advantage of the
private automobile it's there when and

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:32.970
private automobile it's there when and
 

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:34.640
private automobile it's there when and
where you need it this is something of a

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:34.650
where you need it this is something of a
 

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:36.290
where you need it this is something of a
myth actually cuz you have to get dig it

00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:36.300
myth actually cuz you have to get dig it
 

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:38.390
myth actually cuz you have to get dig it
out of parking and you may then you

00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:38.400
out of parking and you may then you
 

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:40.040
out of parking and you may then you
don't have a parking space and so on so

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:40.050
don't have a parking space and so on so
 

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:41.959
don't have a parking space and so on so
so we get great door-to-door times we

00:07:41.959 --> 00:07:41.969
so we get great door-to-door times we
 

00:07:41.969 --> 00:07:43.790
so we get great door-to-door times we
believe out of this our simulation

00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:43.800
believe out of this our simulation
 

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:45.800
believe out of this our simulation
suggests this to us

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:45.810
suggests this to us
 

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:48.409
suggests this to us
we get very high utilization rate out of

00:07:48.409 --> 00:07:48.419
we get very high utilization rate out of
 

00:07:48.419 --> 00:07:50.510
we get very high utilization rate out of
the vehicles in this sort of system so

00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:50.520
the vehicles in this sort of system so
 

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:52.879
the vehicles in this sort of system so
vehicles are not sitting around doing

00:07:52.879 --> 00:07:52.889
vehicles are not sitting around doing
 

00:07:52.889 --> 00:07:55.279
vehicles are not sitting around doing
nothing and we occupy a minimal amount

00:07:55.279 --> 00:07:55.289
nothing and we occupy a minimal amount
 

00:07:55.289 --> 00:07:58.490
nothing and we occupy a minimal amount
of urban real estate to do this so it's

00:07:58.490 --> 00:07:58.500
of urban real estate to do this so it's
 

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:01.159
of urban real estate to do this so it's
a system that has a tremendous number of

00:08:01.159 --> 00:08:01.169
a system that has a tremendous number of
 

00:08:01.169 --> 00:08:02.779
a system that has a tremendous number of
advantages if you can really make it

00:08:02.779 --> 00:08:02.789
advantages if you can really make it
 

00:08:02.789 --> 00:08:04.550
advantages if you can really make it

fundamental technical issue with

00:08:06.290 --> 00:08:06.300
fundamental technical issue with
 

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:08.360
fundamental technical issue with
mobility on demand systems is how do you

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:08.370
mobility on demand systems is how do you
 

00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:11.420
mobility on demand systems is how do you
keep the system balanced because if you

00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:11.430
keep the system balanced because if you
 

00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:13.129
keep the system balanced because if you
if you just think about of this this in

if you just think about of this this in
 

00:08:13.139 --> 00:08:14.870
if you just think about of this this in
very rough intuitive terms you can

00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:14.880
very rough intuitive terms you can
 

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:17.719
very rough intuitive terms you can
imagine easily that after a while so if

the demanders are over here so how do

00:08:20.899 --> 00:08:20.909
the demanders are over here so how do

the system balanced and there are

00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:24.360
the system balanced and there are
 

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:27.140
the system balanced and there are
various ways to think about the the way

00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:27.150
various ways to think about the the way
 

00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:29.300
various ways to think about the the way
that we do it and I think it's a very

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:29.310
that we do it and I think it's a very
 

00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:31.010
that we do it and I think it's a very
innovative way of doing it is with

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:31.020
innovative way of doing it is with
 

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:34.130
innovative way of doing it is with
dynamic price incentives so on-the-fly

00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:34.140
dynamic price incentives so on-the-fly
 

00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:37.760
dynamic price incentives so on-the-fly
we create price incentives to return

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:37.770
we create price incentives to return
 

00:08:37.770 --> 00:08:39.680
we create price incentives to return
vehicles to locations that are not

00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:39.690
vehicles to locations that are not
 

00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:41.719
vehicles to locations that are not
crowded that need vehicles and we create

00:08:41.719 --> 00:08:41.729
crowded that need vehicles and we create
 

00:08:41.729 --> 00:08:44.120
crowded that need vehicles and we create
some disincentives to you know return

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:44.130
some disincentives to you know return
 

00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:48.170
some disincentives to you know return
them to locations that you know already

00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:48.180
them to locations that you know already
 

00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:49.880

have plenty of vehicles and similarly

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:49.890
have plenty of vehicles and similarly

have plenty of vehicles and similarly
with pickup we make it cheap we make it

00:08:52.699 --> 00:08:52.709
with pickup we make it cheap we make it
 

00:08:52.709 --> 00:08:54.500
with pickup we make it cheap we make it
a bargain to pickup vehicles at

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:54.510
a bargain to pickup vehicles at
 

00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:56.360
a bargain to pickup vehicles at
locations where vehicles are plentiful

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:56.370
locations where vehicles are plentiful
 

00:08:56.370 --> 00:08:57.949
locations where vehicles are plentiful
and we make it a bit more expensive to

00:08:57.949 --> 00:08:57.959
and we make it a bit more expensive to
 

00:08:57.959 --> 00:09:00.829
and we make it a bit more expensive to
pickup vehicles where where they're

00:09:00.829 --> 00:09:00.839
pickup vehicles where where they're
 

00:09:00.839 --> 00:09:06.410
pickup vehicles where where they're
scarce so there is elasticity in the

00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:06.420
scarce so there is elasticity in the
 

00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:08.269
scarce so there is elasticity in the
demand for mobility and we have a

00:09:08.269 --> 00:09:08.279
demand for mobility and we have a
 

00:09:08.279 --> 00:09:10.400
demand for mobility and we have a
certain amount of choice about when we

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:10.410
certain amount of choice about when we
 

00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:12.800
certain amount of choice about when we
make trips and exactly where we make

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:12.810
make trips and exactly where we make

horseless carriage thinking and even the
 

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:15.350
horseless carriage thinking and even the
terms sort of suggest to you what I'm

00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:15.360

essentially it was a kind of

00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:22.350
essentially it was a kind of
 

00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:24.110
essentially it was a kind of
substitution to take out the horse and

00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:24.120

to get away from the old idea that you
fill a vehicle up with a fairly large

amount of energy and drive it around for
 

00:13:02.610 --> 00:13:04.639
amount of energy and drive it around for
quite a long time and then fill it up

00:13:04.639 --> 00:13:04.649
quite a long time and then fill it up
 

00:13:04.649 --> 00:13:05.030
quite a long time and then fill it up
again

00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:05.040

so people have taken that over into
 

00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:11.449
so people have taken that over into

thinking about batteries right to charge
 

00:13:11.459 --> 00:13:12.889

up the batteries and you drive around

00:13:12.889 --> 00:13:12.899
up the batteries and you drive around
 

00:13:12.899 --> 00:13:14.930
up the batteries and you drive around
for a long time and then you you charge

00:13:14.930 --> 00:13:14.940
for a long time and then you you charge
 

00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:16.879
for a long time and then you you charge
them up again our view is quite

00:13:16.879 --> 00:13:16.889
them up again our view is quite
 

00:13:16.889 --> 00:13:21.800

the hold of your electric toothbrush you
know you drop your electric toothbrush

00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:35.190
know you drop your electric toothbrush
 

00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:36.920

recharges and you never think about

00:13:38.629 --> 00:13:38.639
recharges and you never think about
 

00:13:38.639 --> 00:13:40.280
recharges and you never think about
charging the toothbrush and it's never

charging the toothbrush and it's never
 

00:13:40.290 --> 00:13:42.559
charging the toothbrush and it's never
without charge because whenever you're

00:13:42.559 --> 00:13:42.569
without charge because whenever you're
 

00:13:42.569 --> 00:13:44.929
without charge because whenever you're
not using it it's just picking up charge

00:13:44.929 --> 00:13:44.939
not using it it's just picking up charge
 

00:13:44.939 --> 00:13:46.910
not using it it's just picking up charge
so imagine a kind of system where you

00:13:46.910 --> 00:13:46.920
so imagine a kind of system where you
 

00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:49.780
so imagine a kind of system where you
have lightweight electric vehicles

00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:49.790

you never have to worry about filling up

00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:05.310
you never have to worry about filling up

you do this you throw a large amount of
battery storage capacity into the

with electric grids is they don't have a
 

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:29.190
with electric grids is they don't have a
lot of storage capacity usually they

00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:29.200
lot of storage capacity usually they

don't have any storage capacity which
 

00:14:31.390 --> 00:14:34.140
don't have any storage capacity which
means you have a problem of peak loading

00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:34.150
means you have a problem of peak loading
 

00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:36.060
means you have a problem of peak loading
and once again it's a balancing problem

00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:36.070

you have to have to you have to size the
 

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:39.990
you have to have to you have to size the

rest of the time you have over capacity
 

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:48.390
rest of the time you have over capacity
if you size it for that this is

00:14:48.390 --> 00:14:48.400
if you size it for that this is
 

00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:50.690
if you size it for that this is
oversimplifying a complex issue then you

00:14:50.690 --> 00:14:50.700
oversimplifying a complex issue then you
 

00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:53.940
oversimplifying a complex issue then you
get the idea and then there's also a

00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:53.950
get the idea and then there's also a
 

00:14:53.950 --> 00:14:59.700
get the idea and then there's also a
problem with intermittency clean power

00:14:59.700 --> 00:14:59.710
problem with intermittency clean power
 

00:14:59.710 --> 00:15:04.230

electricity the Sun doesn't necessarily
 

00:15:11.170 --> 00:15:14.519
electricity the Sun doesn't necessarily
shine but if you have storage capacity

00:15:14.519 --> 00:15:14.529
shine but if you have storage capacity
 

00:15:14.529 --> 00:15:17.220
shine but if you have storage capacity
in the grid and then you set it up so

00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:17.230
in the grid and then you set it up so
 

00:15:17.230 --> 00:15:20.010
in the grid and then you set it up so
that automobiles can buy and sell

00:15:20.010 --> 00:15:20.020

they become little energy traders
essentially this gives you a mechanism

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:27.490
essentially this gives you a mechanism

that intermittent power source is much
more cost-effective so you see with with

more cost-effective so you see with with
 

00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:43.170
more cost-effective so you see with with
all of these issues I think you have to

look at them from multiple points of
 

00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:47.820
look at them from multiple points of
view simultaneously so from one point of

unbelievably complex just to operating I

00:19:57.260 --> 00:19:57.270
unbelievably complex just to operating I
 

00:19:57.270 --> 00:20:00.049
unbelievably complex just to operating I
wouldn't I wouldn't start with New York

00:20:00.049 --> 00:20:00.059
wouldn't I wouldn't start with New York
 

00:20:00.059 --> 00:20:02.480
wouldn't I wouldn't start with New York
that's right

00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:02.490
that's right
 

00:20:02.490 --> 00:20:06.410
that's right
there are take a city like Singapore for

00:20:06.410 --> 00:20:06.420
there are take a city like Singapore for
 

00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:11.890
there are take a city like Singapore for
example it's much more a kind of

00:20:11.890 --> 00:20:11.900
example it's much more a kind of
 

00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:15.110
example it's much more a kind of
top-down context for getting things

00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:15.120
top-down context for getting things
 

00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:16.960
top-down context for getting things
implemented and then you know pretty

00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:16.970
implemented and then you know pretty
 

00:20:16.970 --> 00:20:19.760
implemented and then you know pretty
very efficient sort of technocratic and

00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:19.770
very efficient sort of technocratic and
 

00:20:19.770 --> 00:20:21.169
very efficient sort of technocratic and
a framework for getting things done so

00:20:21.169 --> 00:20:21.179
a framework for getting things done so
 

00:20:21.179 --> 00:20:22.700
a framework for getting things done so
you know so there are contexts where

00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:22.710
you know so there are contexts where
 

00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:25.370
you know so there are contexts where
it's easier to get things done than

00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:25.380
it's easier to get things done than
 

00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:29.750
it's easier to get things done than
other contexts now I have great belief

00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:29.760
other contexts now I have great belief
 

00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:32.659
other contexts now I have great belief
in democratic complexity in the

00:20:32.659 --> 00:20:32.669
in democratic complexity in the
 

00:20:32.669 --> 00:20:34.430
in democratic complexity in the
representation of you know different

00:20:34.430 --> 00:20:34.440
representation of you know different
 

00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:37.820
representation of you know different
interest groups and so on that it does

00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:37.830
interest groups and so on that it does
 

00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:40.039
interest groups and so on that it does
make it slower sometimes to get things

00:20:40.039 --> 00:20:40.049
make it slower sometimes to get things
 

00:20:40.049 --> 00:20:45.130
make it slower sometimes to get things
done in this sort of context

00:20:45.130 --> 00:20:45.140
 

00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:49.250
yeah we believe very strongly in cross

00:20:49.250 --> 00:20:49.260
yeah we believe very strongly in cross
 

00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:51.140
yeah we believe very strongly in cross
disciplinary collaboration to deal with

00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:51.150
disciplinary collaboration to deal with
 

00:20:51.150 --> 00:20:56.180
disciplinary collaboration to deal with
these large-scale issues because the the

00:20:56.180 --> 00:20:56.190
these large-scale issues because the the
 

00:20:56.190 --> 00:20:58.550
these large-scale issues because the the
problems have no respect for traditional

00:20:58.550 --> 00:20:58.560
problems have no respect for traditional
 

00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:00.680
problems have no respect for traditional
disciplinary boundaries and ISO so

00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:00.690
disciplinary boundaries and ISO so
 

00:21:00.690 --> 00:21:03.290
disciplinary boundaries and ISO so
dealing with mobility on demand systems

00:21:03.290 --> 00:21:03.300
dealing with mobility on demand systems
 

00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:04.820
dealing with mobility on demand systems
for example you know we have to design

00:21:04.820 --> 00:21:04.830
for example you know we have to design
 

00:21:04.830 --> 00:21:06.890
for example you know we have to design
electric vehicles so there's a

00:21:06.890 --> 00:21:06.900
electric vehicles so there's a
 

00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:08.570
electric vehicles so there's a
mechanical engineering and product

00:21:08.570 --> 00:21:08.580
mechanical engineering and product
 

00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:10.940
mechanical engineering and product
design issue there's a there's an issue

00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:10.950
design issue there's a there's an issue
 

00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:12.860
design issue there's a there's an issue
of electrical systems there's an issue

00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:12.870
of electrical systems there's an issue
 

00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:14.930
of electrical systems there's an issue
of information systems there's an issue

00:21:14.930 --> 00:21:14.940
of information systems there's an issue
 

00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:17.140
of information systems there's an issue
of urban real estate and urban design

00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:17.150
of urban real estate and urban design
 

00:21:17.150 --> 00:21:20.990
of urban real estate and urban design
there's an issue of the you know the

00:21:20.990 --> 00:21:21.000
there's an issue of the you know the
 

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.060
there's an issue of the you know the
economics and business models of these

00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:23.070
economics and business models of these
 

00:21:23.070 --> 00:21:26.360
economics and business models of these
systems there's an issue of how you do

00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:26.370
systems there's an issue of how you do
 

00:21:26.370 --> 00:21:28.790
systems there's an issue of how you do
the the software that does the

00:21:28.790 --> 00:21:28.800
the the software that does the
 

00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:30.770
the the software that does the
optimization of the systems and so so

00:21:30.770 --> 00:21:30.780
optimization of the systems and so so
 

00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:33.140
optimization of the systems and so so
this you know sprawls in an incredibly

00:21:33.140 --> 00:21:33.150
this you know sprawls in an incredibly
 

00:21:33.150 --> 00:21:34.910
this you know sprawls in an incredibly
messy way across a lot of traditional

00:21:34.910 --> 00:21:34.920
messy way across a lot of traditional
 

00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:36.920
messy way across a lot of traditional
disciplinary boundaries that's exactly

00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:36.930
disciplinary boundaries that's exactly
 

00:21:36.930 --> 00:21:38.750
disciplinary boundaries that's exactly
where we love to work I mean that's just

00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:38.760
where we love to work I mean that's just
 

00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:40.310
where we love to work I mean that's just
exactly where we think we can make our

00:21:40.310 --> 00:21:40.320
exactly where we think we can make our
 

00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:42.470
exactly where we think we can make our
major contribution but that is different

00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:42.480
major contribution but that is different
 

00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:45.020
major contribution but that is different
from the traditional disciplinary

00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:45.030
from the traditional disciplinary
 

00:21:45.030 --> 00:21:47.120
from the traditional disciplinary
organization of universities where you

00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:47.130
organization of universities where you
 

00:21:47.130 --> 00:21:48.080
organization of universities where you
know the mechanical engineering

00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:48.090
know the mechanical engineering
 

00:21:48.090 --> 00:21:49.610
know the mechanical engineering
department does mechanical engineering

00:21:49.610 --> 00:21:49.620
department does mechanical engineering
 

00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:51.800
department does mechanical engineering
and the urban planners do urban planning

00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:51.810
and the urban planners do urban planning
 

00:21:51.810 --> 00:21:55.520
and the urban planners do urban planning
and so on so we very explicitly you know

00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:55.530
and so on so we very explicitly you know
 

00:21:55.530 --> 00:21:57.710
and so on so we very explicitly you know
put forward an alternative model and

00:21:57.710 --> 00:21:57.720
put forward an alternative model and
 

00:21:57.720 --> 00:21:59.810
put forward an alternative model and
then I think the the other thing that we

00:21:59.810 --> 00:21:59.820
then I think the the other thing that we
 

00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:02.770
then I think the the other thing that we
do that I think is very important is we

00:22:02.770 --> 00:22:02.780
do that I think is very important is we
 

00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:05.870
do that I think is very important is we
collaborate very very closely with

00:22:05.870 --> 00:22:05.880
collaborate very very closely with
 

00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:07.430
collaborate very very closely with
industry and it's not just a matter of

00:22:07.430 --> 00:22:07.440
industry and it's not just a matter of
 

00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:09.500
industry and it's not just a matter of
industry providing funding but it's

00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:09.510
industry providing funding but it's
 

00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:12.590
industry providing funding but it's
really engaging the expertise that

00:22:12.590 --> 00:22:12.600
really engaging the expertise that
 

00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:14.330
really engaging the expertise that
industry brings to the table it's very

00:22:14.330 --> 00:22:14.340
industry brings to the table it's very
 

00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:17.570
industry brings to the table it's very
much an intellectual a collaboration so

00:22:17.570 --> 00:22:17.580
much an intellectual a collaboration so
 

00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:19.550
much an intellectual a collaboration so
you know our city car project we

00:22:19.550 --> 00:22:19.560
you know our city car project we
 

00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:21.200
you know our city car project we
collaborate very closely with General

00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:21.210
collaborate very closely with General
 

00:22:21.210 --> 00:22:24.290
collaborate very closely with General
Motors and despite the popular

00:22:24.290 --> 00:22:24.300
Motors and despite the popular
 

00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:25.940
Motors and despite the popular
perception right now they do know a lot

00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:25.950
perception right now they do know a lot
 

00:22:25.950 --> 00:22:28.400
perception right now they do know a lot
about building automobiles you know I

00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:28.410
about building automobiles you know I
 

00:22:28.410 --> 00:22:30.680
about building automobiles you know I
have enormous respect for the people we

00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:30.690
have enormous respect for the people we
 

00:22:30.690 --> 00:22:34.880
have enormous respect for the people we
work with in MGM we've worked with city

00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:34.890
work with in MGM we've worked with city
 

00:22:34.890 --> 00:22:37.490
work with in MGM we've worked with city
governments we work with we're working

00:22:37.490 --> 00:22:37.500
governments we work with we're working
 

00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:39.440
governments we work with we're working
right now with Schneider Electric in

00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:39.450
right now with Schneider Electric in
 

00:22:39.450 --> 00:22:41.930
right now with Schneider Electric in
looking at the you know that the the the

00:22:41.930 --> 00:22:41.940
looking at the you know that the the the
 

00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:45.290
looking at the you know that the the the
large scale electrical systems and so on

00:22:45.290 --> 00:22:45.300
large scale electrical systems and so on
 

00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:48.280
large scale electrical systems and so on
and so I think this is absolutely

00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:48.290
and so I think this is absolutely
 

00:22:48.290 --> 00:22:51.640
and so I think this is absolutely
necessary I think this is very very

00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:51.650
necessary I think this is very very
 

00:22:51.650 --> 00:22:54.200
necessary I think this is very very
important and I say this is very much as

00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:54.210
important and I say this is very much as
 

00:22:54.210 --> 00:22:56.799
important and I say this is very much as
our role and in being able to

00:22:56.799 --> 00:22:56.809
our role and in being able to
 

00:22:56.809 --> 00:23:01.210
our role and in being able to
lay out some version of a comprehensive

00:23:01.210 --> 00:23:01.220
lay out some version of a comprehensive
 

00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:03.999
lay out some version of a comprehensive
vision that integrates the different

00:23:03.999 --> 00:23:04.009
vision that integrates the different
 

00:23:04.009 --> 00:23:06.149
vision that integrates the different
perspectives and different disciplinary

00:23:06.149 --> 00:23:06.159
perspectives and different disciplinary
 

00:23:06.159 --> 00:23:08.320
perspectives and different disciplinary
viewpoints very challenging very

00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:08.330
viewpoints very challenging very
 

00:23:08.330 --> 00:23:09.879
viewpoints very challenging very
difficult way to work enough so it's

00:23:09.879 --> 00:23:09.889
difficult way to work enough so it's
 

00:23:09.889 --> 00:23:11.590
difficult way to work enough so it's
much easier just to say well this is my

00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:11.600
much easier just to say well this is my
 

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:13.779
much easier just to say well this is my
area of expertise and I'll stay within

00:23:13.779 --> 00:23:13.789
area of expertise and I'll stay within
 

00:23:13.789 --> 00:23:17.560
area of expertise and I'll stay within
it that we we make a major point of

00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:17.570
it that we we make a major point of
 

00:23:17.570 --> 00:23:19.539
it that we we make a major point of
operating in this way and I think it's

00:23:19.539 --> 00:23:19.549
operating in this way and I think it's
 

00:23:19.549 --> 00:23:23.820
operating in this way and I think it's
absolutely essential

00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:23.830
 

00:23:23.830 --> 00:23:27.290
now there's no magical solution because

00:23:27.290 --> 00:23:27.300
now there's no magical solution because
 

00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:31.590
now there's no magical solution because
you know urban traffic congestion arises

00:23:31.590 --> 00:23:31.600
you know urban traffic congestion arises
 

00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:32.820
you know urban traffic congestion arises
from in fact a lot of people want to be

00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:32.830
from in fact a lot of people want to be
 

00:23:32.830 --> 00:23:34.530
from in fact a lot of people want to be
in the same place at the same time often

00:23:34.530 --> 00:23:34.540
in the same place at the same time often
 

00:23:34.540 --> 00:23:36.990
in the same place at the same time often
I'd like a Red Sox game or something

00:23:36.990 --> 00:23:37.000
I'd like a Red Sox game or something
 

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.400
I'd like a Red Sox game or something
like it's gonna get congested around

00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:38.410
like it's gonna get congested around
 

00:23:38.410 --> 00:23:40.200
like it's gonna get congested around
there that's just them just just just

00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:40.210
there that's just them just just just

there that's just them just just just
the way it goes and so there's no magic

00:23:42.570 --> 00:23:42.580
the way it goes and so there's no magic
 

00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:44.850
the way it goes and so there's no magic
you know in all of this but they're a

00:23:44.850 --> 00:23:44.860
you know in all of this but they're a
 

00:23:44.860 --> 00:23:47.940
you know in all of this but they're a
bunch of things that you can do firstly

00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:47.950
bunch of things that you can do firstly
 

00:23:47.950 --> 00:23:50.960
bunch of things that you can do firstly
our cars a much smaller footprint than

00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:50.970
our cars a much smaller footprint than
 

00:23:50.970 --> 00:23:54.720
our cars a much smaller footprint than
traditional automobiles secondly they

00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:54.730
traditional automobiles secondly they
 

00:23:54.730 --> 00:23:57.690
traditional automobiles secondly they
occupy much less parking space

00:23:57.690 --> 00:23:57.700
occupy much less parking space
 

00:23:57.700 --> 00:24:00.210
occupy much less parking space
thirdly they're managed and this is

00:24:00.210 --> 00:24:00.220
thirdly they're managed and this is
 

00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:02.010
thirdly they're managed and this is
actually more important they're managed

00:24:02.010 --> 00:24:02.020
actually more important they're managed
 

00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:04.650
actually more important they're managed
in a more sophisticated way so you get

00:24:04.650 --> 00:24:04.660
in a more sophisticated way so you get
 

00:24:04.660 --> 00:24:08.220
in a more sophisticated way so you get
high utilization rates you make them

00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:08.230
high utilization rates you make them
 

00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:10.200
high utilization rates you make them
available exactly where they need to be

00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:10.210
available exactly where they need to be
 

00:24:10.210 --> 00:24:12.090
available exactly where they need to be
available and then get them out of the

00:24:12.090 --> 00:24:12.100
available and then get them out of the
 

00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:16.770

way and then the other thing is if you
 

00:24:16.780 --> 00:24:20.010
way and then the other thing is if you
think of traffic flow the way you get

that the higher the demand the more you
have to pay that so so I think we are

00:27:46.490 --> 00:27:46.500
have to pay that so so I think we are
 

00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:49.600
have to pay that so so I think we are
going to see a great deal more of

providers of mobility resources and by
 

00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:06.490

the consumers and mobility resources

00:28:06.490 --> 00:28:06.500

what it's costing and how you want to
 

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.120
what it's costing and how you want to
allocate your resources right now it's

00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:11.130
allocate your resources right now it's
 

00:28:11.130 --> 00:28:12.799
allocate your resources right now it's
very difficult to be rational about

that kind of thing and so the strategy

00:30:35.510 --> 00:30:35.520
that kind of thing and so the strategy
 

00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:39.370
that kind of thing and so the strategy
there that we pursued as a strategy of

this technological barriers are not
 

00:31:16.950 --> 00:31:21.740
this technological barriers are not
great so I think we can build the right

00:31:21.740 --> 00:31:21.750
great so I think we can build the right
 

00:31:21.750 --> 00:31:24.200

kinds of automobiles within a couple of
 

00:31:24.210 --> 00:31:26.030
kinds of automobiles within a couple of
years and I don't think that's a long

00:31:26.030 --> 00:31:26.040
years and I don't think that's a long
 

00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:33.320
years and I don't think that's a long
timeline I think the the regulatory

00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:33.330
timeline I think the the regulatory
 

00:31:33.330 --> 00:31:35.450
timeline I think the the regulatory
issues and the political consensus

00:31:35.450 --> 00:31:35.460

building issues are potentially the you
 

00:31:37.530 --> 00:31:42.070
building issues are potentially the you
know the long timeline and that could

00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:42.080
know the long timeline and that could
 

00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:47.659
know the long timeline and that could
take many years I think this the cities

00:31:47.659 --> 00:31:47.669
take many years I think this the cities
 

00:31:47.669 --> 00:31:49.549
take many years I think this the cities
that are likely to be competitive and

00:31:49.549 --> 00:31:49.559
that are likely to be competitive and
 

00:31:49.559 --> 00:31:51.620
that are likely to be competitive and
they're likely to win in doing these

00:31:51.620 --> 00:31:51.630
they're likely to win in doing these
 

00:31:51.630 --> 00:31:52.880
they're likely to win in doing these
sorts of things the ones that are able

to cut through all of that kind of stuff
 

00:31:54.929 --> 00:31:56.780
to cut through all of that kind of stuff
and move you know quickly and

00:31:56.790 --> 00:31:59.450
and move you know quickly and
effectively hard to say which ones

00:32:09.510 --> 00:32:09.520
 

00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:14.460
no no you I think you have to

00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:14.470
no no you I think you have to
 

00:32:14.470 --> 00:32:19.130
no no you I think you have to
distinguish between what I'll call

00:32:19.130 --> 00:32:19.140
distinguish between what I'll call
 

00:32:19.140 --> 00:32:23.370
distinguish between what I'll call
incremental R&amp;D which can be very

00:32:23.370 --> 00:32:23.380
incremental R&amp;D which can be very
 

00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:26.220
incremental R&amp;D which can be very
focused you know you can say that we

00:32:26.220 --> 00:32:26.230
focused you know you can say that we
 

00:32:26.230 --> 00:32:28.260
focused you know you can say that we
need to improve the efficiency of this

00:32:28.260 --> 00:32:28.270
need to improve the efficiency of this
 

00:32:28.270 --> 00:32:30.600
need to improve the efficiency of this
system whatever it is about ten percent

00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:30.610
system whatever it is about ten percent
 

00:32:30.610 --> 00:32:32.550
system whatever it is about ten percent
or something and you can focus a bunch

00:32:32.550 --> 00:32:32.560
or something and you can focus a bunch
 

00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:35.580
or something and you can focus a bunch
of resources on doing that and be with a

00:32:35.580 --> 00:32:35.590
of resources on doing that and be with a
 

00:32:35.590 --> 00:32:40.680
of resources on doing that and be with a
fairly high probability of success you

00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:40.690
fairly high probability of success you
 

00:32:40.690 --> 00:32:44.720
fairly high probability of success you
know get that payoff but the really big

00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:44.730
know get that payoff but the really big
 

00:32:44.730 --> 00:32:47.130
know get that payoff but the really big
fundamental transformations are

00:32:47.130 --> 00:32:47.140
fundamental transformations are
 

00:32:47.140 --> 00:32:51.240
fundamental transformations are
fundamentally unpredictable and that's

00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:51.250
fundamentally unpredictable and that's
 

00:32:51.250 --> 00:32:52.860
fundamentally unpredictable and that's
the very definition of a creative

00:32:52.860 --> 00:32:52.870
the very definition of a creative
 

00:32:52.870 --> 00:32:55.080
the very definition of a creative
disruptive transformation in fact and

00:32:55.080 --> 00:32:55.090
disruptive transformation in fact and
 

00:32:55.090 --> 00:32:56.790
disruptive transformation in fact and
those things where the big payoff comes

00:32:56.790 --> 00:32:56.800
those things where the big payoff comes
 

00:32:56.800 --> 00:32:59.220
those things where the big payoff comes
from so the the internet for example

00:32:59.220 --> 00:32:59.230
from so the the internet for example
 

00:32:59.230 --> 00:33:01.890
from so the the internet for example
came out of nowhere and I've been around

00:33:01.890 --> 00:33:01.900
came out of nowhere and I've been around
 

00:33:01.900 --> 00:33:04.230
came out of nowhere and I've been around
long enough and I was around the

00:33:04.230 --> 00:33:04.240
long enough and I was around the
 

00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:05.550
long enough and I was around the
beginning of the internet that I

00:33:05.550 --> 00:33:05.560
beginning of the internet that I
 

00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:07.500
beginning of the internet that I
remember it personally so I can attest

00:33:07.500 --> 00:33:07.510
remember it personally so I can attest
 

00:33:07.510 --> 00:33:10.560
remember it personally so I can attest
right that it came nobody knew and what

00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:10.570
right that it came nobody knew and what
 

00:33:10.570 --> 00:33:12.510
right that it came nobody knew and what
to do with this it came out of some

00:33:12.510 --> 00:33:12.520
to do with this it came out of some
 

00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:15.420
to do with this it came out of some
esoteric backroom research that nobody

00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:15.430
esoteric backroom research that nobody
 

00:33:15.430 --> 00:33:17.430
esoteric backroom research that nobody
thought had any huge practical

00:33:17.430 --> 00:33:17.440
thought had any huge practical
 

00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:21.060
thought had any huge practical
implication whatsoever forty years later

00:33:21.060 --> 00:33:21.070
implication whatsoever forty years later
 

00:33:21.070 --> 00:33:22.890

it is about 40 years now it's

00:33:22.890 --> 00:33:22.900
it is about 40 years now it's
 

00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:24.660
it is about 40 years now it's
transformed the world now to completely

00:33:24.660 --> 00:33:24.670
transformed the world now to completely
 

00:33:24.670 --> 00:33:31.860
transformed the world now to completely
transform the world so I think the most

00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:31.870
transform the world so I think the most
 

00:33:31.870 --> 00:33:36.450
transform the world so I think the most
effective economic thing that you can do

00:33:36.450 --> 00:33:36.460
effective economic thing that you can do
 

00:33:36.460 --> 00:33:39.330
effective economic thing that you can do
and that's uncertain you know it's risky

00:33:39.330 --> 00:33:39.340
and that's uncertain you know it's risky
 

00:33:39.340 --> 00:33:42.060
and that's uncertain you know it's risky
and uncertain that you have to preserve

00:33:42.060 --> 00:33:42.070
and uncertain that you have to preserve
 

00:33:42.070 --> 00:33:46.010
and uncertain that you have to preserve
the capacity for truly innovative

00:33:46.010 --> 00:33:46.020
the capacity for truly innovative
 

00:33:46.020 --> 00:33:49.020
the capacity for truly innovative
unpredictable undirected research you

00:33:49.020 --> 00:33:49.030
unpredictable undirected research you
 

00:33:49.030 --> 00:33:51.210
unpredictable undirected research you
know it's just just what you have to do

00:33:51.210 --> 00:33:51.220
know it's just just what you have to do
 

00:33:51.220 --> 00:33:53.720
know it's just just what you have to do
if you want the really big payoffs and

00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:53.730
if you want the really big payoffs and
 

00:33:53.730 --> 00:33:56.550
if you want the really big payoffs and
this drives people crazy because they

00:33:56.550 --> 00:33:56.560
this drives people crazy because they
 

00:33:56.560 --> 00:33:58.410
this drives people crazy because they
want predictability but if you think

00:33:58.410 --> 00:33:58.420
want predictability but if you think
 

00:33:58.420 --> 00:34:00.030
want predictability but if you think
about the fundamental contradiction

00:34:00.030 --> 00:34:00.040
about the fundamental contradiction
 

00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:02.250
about the fundamental contradiction
between the idea of making a fundamental

00:34:02.250 --> 00:34:02.260
between the idea of making a fundamental
 

00:34:02.260 --> 00:34:04.770
between the idea of making a fundamental
creative innovation and being totally

00:34:04.770 --> 00:34:04.780
creative innovation and being totally
 

00:34:04.780 --> 00:34:06.450
creative innovation and being totally
predictable right it was totally

00:34:06.450 --> 00:34:06.460
predictable right it was totally
 

00:34:06.460 --> 00:34:09.840
predictable right it was totally
predictable anybody could do it so no I

00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:09.850
predictable anybody could do it so no I
 

00:34:09.850 --> 00:34:11.730
predictable anybody could do it so no I
think the place like MIT and I think a

00:34:11.730 --> 00:34:11.740
think the place like MIT and I think a
 

00:34:11.740 --> 00:34:13.350
think the place like MIT and I think a
place like the Media Lab particularly is

00:34:13.350 --> 00:34:13.360
place like the Media Lab particularly is
 

00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:17.130
place like the Media Lab particularly is
very much dedicated to that idea that we

00:34:17.130 --> 00:34:17.140
very much dedicated to that idea that we
 

00:34:17.140 --> 00:34:19.260
very much dedicated to that idea that we
investigate all kinds of crazy things

00:34:19.260 --> 00:34:19.270
investigate all kinds of crazy things
 

00:34:19.270 --> 00:34:21.270
investigate all kinds of crazy things
and frankly most of them fail or at

00:34:21.270 --> 00:34:21.280
and frankly most of them fail or at
 

00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:22.740
and frankly most of them fail or at
least in the short term they don't go

00:34:22.740 --> 00:34:22.750
least in the short term they don't go
 

00:34:22.750 --> 00:34:23.460
least in the short term they don't go
anywhere

00:34:23.460 --> 00:34:23.470
anywhere
 

00:34:23.470 --> 00:34:25.169
anywhere
but every now and again one of them pays

00:34:25.169 --> 00:34:25.179
but every now and again one of them pays
 

00:34:25.179 --> 00:34:27.210
but every now and again one of them pays
off really big time and really

00:34:27.210 --> 00:34:27.220
off really big time and really
 

00:34:27.220 --> 00:34:29.190
off really big time and really
transforms things and I think you have

00:34:29.190 --> 00:34:29.200
transforms things and I think you have
 

00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:32.339
transforms things and I think you have
to do that it's a way to look at it it's

00:34:32.339 --> 00:34:32.349
to do that it's a way to look at it it's
 

00:34:32.349 --> 00:34:33.960
to do that it's a way to look at it it's
like any other kind of investment you

00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:33.970
like any other kind of investment you
 

00:34:33.970 --> 00:34:35.609
like any other kind of investment you
know portfolio of investments know

00:34:35.609 --> 00:34:35.619
know portfolio of investments know
 

00:34:35.619 --> 00:34:37.169
know portfolio of investments know
everything about investing research and

00:34:37.169 --> 00:34:37.179
everything about investing research and
 

00:34:37.179 --> 00:34:40.050
everything about investing research and
development money you you you you you

00:34:40.050 --> 00:34:40.060
development money you you you you you
 

00:34:40.060 --> 00:34:41.700

you want to pursue some straightforward

00:34:41.700 --> 00:34:41.710
you want to pursue some straightforward

you want to pursue some straightforward
sure things that need to get done but

00:34:44.550 --> 00:34:44.560
sure things that need to get done but
 

00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:47.669
sure things that need to get done but
you don't want to neglect the the big

00:34:47.669 --> 00:34:47.679
you don't want to neglect the the big
 

00:34:47.679 --> 00:34:50.399
you don't want to neglect the the big
transformative things that's very very

00:34:50.399 --> 00:34:50.409
transformative things that's very very
 

00:34:50.409 --> 00:34:54.830
transformative things that's very very
short-sighted

specifically I think they're they they

00:35:04.700 --> 00:35:04.710
specifically I think they're they they
 

00:35:04.710 --> 00:35:09.820
specifically I think they're they they
have to do I think mostly with various

00:35:09.820 --> 00:35:09.830
have to do I think mostly with various
 

00:35:09.830 --> 00:35:11.720
have to do I think mostly with various
aspects of what we've already talked

00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:11.730
aspects of what we've already talked
 

00:35:11.730 --> 00:35:13.700
aspects of what we've already talked
about so I think we are going to see

00:35:13.700 --> 00:35:13.710
about so I think we are going to see
 

00:35:13.710 --> 00:35:15.650
about so I think we are going to see
some big breakthroughs in light weight

00:35:15.650 --> 00:35:15.660
some big breakthroughs in light weight
 

00:35:15.660 --> 00:35:17.450
some big breakthroughs in light weight
efficient electric vehicles over the

efficient electric vehicles over the
 

00:35:17.460 --> 00:35:19.430
efficient electric vehicles over the
next few years a very difficult to

00:35:19.430 --> 00:35:19.440
next few years a very difficult to
 

00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:21.380
next few years a very difficult to
predict exactly how that's going to go

00:35:21.380 --> 00:35:21.390
predict exactly how that's going to go
 

00:35:21.390 --> 00:35:23.750
predict exactly how that's going to go
but it's I think a very certain

00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:23.760
but it's I think a very certain
 

00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:25.400
but it's I think a very certain
prediction that we're going to see a lot

00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:25.410
prediction that we're going to see a lot
 

00:35:25.410 --> 00:35:27.530
prediction that we're going to see a lot
of development in that area so that's

00:35:27.530 --> 00:35:27.540
of development in that area so that's
 

00:35:27.540 --> 00:35:30.820
of development in that area so that's
one thing I think we're going to see

00:35:30.820 --> 00:35:30.830
one thing I think we're going to see
 

00:35:30.830 --> 00:35:34.460
one thing I think we're going to see
some very surprising things in

systems and they've talked about some of

00:35:39.380 --> 00:35:39.390
systems and they've talked about some of
 

00:35:39.390 --> 00:35:41.180
systems and they've talked about some of
the sorts of things that can maybe

the sorts of things that can maybe
 

00:35:41.190 --> 00:35:44.859
the sorts of things that can maybe
happen there and then I think you know

00:35:44.859 --> 00:35:44.869
happen there and then I think you know
 

00:35:44.869 --> 00:35:50.030
happen there and then I think you know
rethinking the whole concept of mobility
