00:00:00.536 --> 00:00:03.143
So, let's say we are in the apple market.

00:00:03.482 --> 00:00:05.462
What I want to do in
this video is think about

00:00:05.462 --> 00:00:08.602
both demand and supply for the apples at

00:00:08.602 --> 00:00:10.101
different prices.

00:00:10.101 --> 00:00:13.105
Let's draw ourselves a little graph here.

00:00:13.819 --> 00:00:15.262
We already know this right over here,

00:00:15.262 --> 00:00:17.231
the vertical axis is the price axis, and

00:00:17.231 --> 00:00:20.424
this we're going to
say is price per pound.

00:00:20.639 --> 00:00:23.062
The horizontal axis this is the quantity.

00:00:24.077 --> 00:00:26.072
The quantity of apples.

00:00:26.072 --> 00:00:27.929
Let's put some tick marks here.

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:30.147
Let's say that's $1 a pound, $2 a pound,

00:00:30.147 --> 00:00:34.230
$3 a pound, $4 a pound, and $5, and

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.333
let's say this is
thousands of pounds produce

00:00:38.333 --> 00:00:39.902
and we have to set a period.

00:00:39.902 --> 00:00:42.658
Let's say this is for the
next week, and so this is

00:00:42.658 --> 00:00:49.298
1000 pounds, 2000, 3000, 4000, and 5000.

00:00:49.298 --> 00:00:51.326
Now, let's think about
both the supply and the

00:00:51.326 --> 00:00:54.660
demand curves for this
market, or potential

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.466
supply and demand curves.

00:00:56.466 --> 00:01:03.261
First I will do the demand.
If the price of apples were

00:01:03.261 --> 00:01:04.991
really high, and I encourage you to always

00:01:04.991 --> 00:01:06.724
think about this when
you are about to draw

00:01:06.724 --> 00:01:09.133
your demand and supply
curves. If the price

00:01:09.133 --> 00:01:11.992
of apples were really
high, what would happen

00:01:11.992 --> 00:01:14.842
to consumers? Well, they
wouldn't demand much.

00:01:15.396 --> 00:01:17.495
The quantity demanded would be low.

00:01:17.495 --> 00:01:20.084
If the price were high, maybe the quantity

00:01:20.084 --> 00:01:23.114
demanded is like 500 apples.

00:01:24.145 --> 00:01:26.386
And once again I am
being very careful to say

00:01:26.386 --> 00:01:28.585
the quantity demanded is 500 apples.

00:01:28.585 --> 00:01:30.715
I'm not saying the demand is 500 apples.

00:01:30.715 --> 00:01:32.875
The demand is the entire relationship.

00:01:32.875 --> 00:01:35.628
The actual specific quantity, we call that

00:01:35.628 --> 00:01:37.450
the quantity demanded.

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.207
The price of $5 of quantity demanded would

00:01:40.207 --> 00:01:43.458
be about 500. Maybe at a
price of $1, the quantity

00:01:43.458 --> 00:01:47.183
demanded would be maybe 4000 pounds.

00:01:47.183 --> 00:01:50.249
Our demand curve might
look something like this.

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:52.128
Might look something like that.

00:01:52.128 --> 00:01:54.580
Let me draw it a little bit less bumpy.

00:01:55.395 --> 00:01:57.795
So, our demand curve might
look something like that.

00:01:57.795 --> 00:02:01.720
I can label it. That is our demand curve.

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.660
I'll think about our supply curve.

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.054
Well, there some price
below which we aren't

00:02:06.054 --> 00:02:08.215
even willing to produce apples.

00:02:08.215 --> 00:02:10.300
Let's say that's like 50 cents.

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.788
So at 50 cents that's where
were even just willing

00:02:12.788 --> 00:02:14.467
to start producing apples.

00:02:14.467 --> 00:02:16.881
Let's say if apples ...
if the price of apple got

00:02:16.881 --> 00:02:19.627
to a dollar where the
quantity we've be willing

00:02:19.627 --> 00:02:22.658
to supply is about a 1000 pounds, and

00:02:22.658 --> 00:02:26.595
it just keeps increasing
as the price increases.

00:02:26.595 --> 00:02:28.628
So this is the supply curve, and

00:02:28.628 --> 00:02:30.220
when I talk about we, I'm talking about

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:31.965
all the suppliers in this market.

00:02:31.965 --> 00:02:33.886
We could be doing this
for a specific supplier.

00:02:33.886 --> 00:02:35.521
We could be doing this
for a specific market.

00:02:35.521 --> 00:02:37.785
We could be doing for
the global apple market.

00:02:37.785 --> 00:02:39.379
However, you want to view it, but for the

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:41.134
sake of this video let's
just assume its like

00:02:41.134 --> 00:02:44.581
our little town that is fairly
isolated and all of that.

00:02:44.581 --> 00:02:48.053
Let's think about what happens
in different scenarios.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:53.430
What happens if the
suppliers of the apples

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.519
going into that week for their
own planning purposes ...

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:00.056
They just think for whatever
reason, that their only going

00:03:00.056 --> 00:03:02.859
to be able to sell the
apples at $1 per pound.

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:10.188
Given the supply curve, they
only supply 1000 pounds.

00:03:10.188 --> 00:03:12.791
This is what the suppliers plan for,

00:03:12.791 --> 00:03:15.918
and this is where they
set the price point at $1.

00:03:15.918 --> 00:03:18.723
One dollar per pound. Now, what's going to

00:03:18.723 --> 00:03:21.683
happen in that scenario?
Well in that scenario

00:03:21.683 --> 00:03:26.789
they supplied 1000. The quantity
supplied is 1000 pounds.

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:29.320
Let me write this down.
So, I'll do it in pink

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.860
for this scenario. So,
this scenario the quantity

00:03:34.336 --> 00:03:38.312
supplied is 1000 pounds.

00:03:39.458 --> 00:03:44.325
What is the quantity
demanded? Quantity demanded.

00:03:47.447 --> 00:03:51.726
This is all the scenario where
the price ... the price or the

00:03:51.726 --> 00:03:54.547
initial price that the
growers or producers set

00:03:54.547 --> 00:03:58.468
was $1 per pound. One dollar per pound.

00:03:58.468 --> 00:04:00.719
Well the quantity demanded
at $1 per pound is

00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:06.262
4000 pounds of apples.
4000 pound of apples.

00:04:06.262 --> 00:04:07.856
What do we have here?

00:04:07.856 --> 00:04:09.664
Well, here we have a shortage.

00:04:09.664 --> 00:04:18.993
We have a shortage of 3000
apples at that price point.

00:04:18.993 --> 00:04:22.387
At a dollar, a lot more people
are going to want to buy apples,

00:04:22.387 --> 00:04:25.480
and the producers just didn't ... I guess

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.592
they didn't figure that out right.

00:04:27.592 --> 00:04:29.473
They didn't produce enough apples.

00:04:29.473 --> 00:04:31.599
Now what will naturally start happening?

00:04:31.599 --> 00:04:34.204
If you have the shortage
... you have all these

00:04:34.204 --> 00:04:35.393
people who want to buy apples, and you

00:04:35.393 --> 00:04:37.061
only have so many apples there,

00:04:37.061 --> 00:04:40.018
what might happen in the
next period in the next week?

00:04:40.018 --> 00:04:42.462
Well, first of all,
those apples that are out

00:04:42.462 --> 00:04:45.394
there they might get bid up,
so, the prices start going

00:04:45.394 --> 00:04:47.402
to start going up. The
prices are going to start

00:04:47.402 --> 00:04:49.326
going up. People are
going to start bidding up

00:04:49.326 --> 00:04:51.199
the apples. They want them so badly.

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:52.662
Their going to start bidding them up,

00:04:52.662 --> 00:04:54.605
and as they start getting
bid up, the producers

00:04:54.605 --> 00:04:56.432
are going to say, "Wow!
There's so many people

00:04:56.432 --> 00:04:58.854
are running out of apples.
We also need to increase

00:04:58.854 --> 00:05:00.936
the quantity produce."

00:05:00.936 --> 00:05:07.529
The quantity will also go
up. The price will go up.

00:05:07.529 --> 00:05:09.992
If you look at from the
suppliers point of view.

00:05:09.992 --> 00:05:12.688
The price will go up, and
the quantity will go up.

00:05:12.688 --> 00:05:16.269
They will move along this line there.

00:05:16.269 --> 00:05:18.337
So maybe in the next period
there's less of a shortage,

00:05:18.337 --> 00:05:22.601
or they move away from
that shortage situation.

00:05:22.601 --> 00:05:25.129
If the price and quantity
increase a little bit,

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:28.457
so maybe the price goes
to $2, and the quantity

00:05:28.457 --> 00:05:30.275
goes to ... I don't know,
this looks like about

00:05:30.275 --> 00:05:33.353
1900 ... 1900 pounds,
now all of a sudden you

00:05:33.353 --> 00:05:37.106
have less of a shortage. I
think you see that I'm getting

00:05:37.106 --> 00:05:38.809
to an interesting point over here.

00:05:38.809 --> 00:05:40.868
I won't go there just
yet. I won't go there

00:05:40.868 --> 00:05:43.282
just yet. Let's think
about another situation.

00:05:43.282 --> 00:05:44.994
Let's think about after this happens.

00:05:44.994 --> 00:05:47.465
Price and quantity increases
so much that essentially

00:05:47.465 --> 00:05:50.694
overshoots this interesting
point right over here.

00:05:50.694 --> 00:05:53.465
So in the next week the
suppliers they'll say,

00:05:53.465 --> 00:05:57.027
"Wow! People want our
apples so badly, let's set

00:05:57.027 --> 00:06:00.105
the price really high at
$3, and at $3 we're really

00:06:00.105 --> 00:06:02.112
excited about producing apples."

00:06:02.112 --> 00:06:06.525
So, we the suppliers
are going to produce ...

00:06:06.525 --> 00:06:08.465
let me do this in a
color I haven't used yet.

00:06:08.465 --> 00:06:12.730
We the suppliers are going
to produce at $3 a pound.

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:17.065
We are hoping to sell
3000 pounds of apples.

00:06:17.065 --> 00:06:18.796
This is where, maybe, they
adjust to the next week.

00:06:18.796 --> 00:06:21.280
What's going to happen
there at a price of $3.

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:26.061
That's the scenario right
over here. The price of $3.

00:06:26.061 --> 00:06:31.532
So, the price is now $3 per pound.

00:06:31.532 --> 00:06:41.329
Well, now the quantity supplied
is going to be 3000 pounds.

00:06:43.866 --> 00:06:47.395
I could write 3000 pounds.

00:06:47.395 --> 00:06:49.197
What is the quantity demanded?

00:06:49.197 --> 00:06:56.200
The quantity demanded is now much lower.

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:58.064
The price is high now,
because the consumers

00:06:58.064 --> 00:06:59.868
might want to go buy other things, or they

00:06:59.868 --> 00:07:02.005
can't afford an apple,
or whatever it might be.

00:07:02.005 --> 00:07:04.861
Now the quantity
demanded, now that's looks

00:07:04.861 --> 00:07:08.734
like about 1300. 1300 pounds.

00:07:09.872 --> 00:07:12.057
What situation do we have now?

00:07:12.057 --> 00:07:15.441
Well, now we have a much
bigger supply then ... or

00:07:15.441 --> 00:07:17.456
the quantity supply is
much bigger than the

00:07:17.456 --> 00:07:23.852
quantity demanded. Now we face a surplus.

00:07:23.852 --> 00:07:26.519
So, now we have a surplus.

00:07:26.519 --> 00:07:28.188
Let me draw that line
there. I want to make it

00:07:28.188 --> 00:07:30.453
clear this is all the same scenario.

00:07:30.453 --> 00:07:33.436
We now have a surplus of ... what is this?

00:07:33.436 --> 00:07:36.936
700 will get us to 2000.
We have a surplus of 1700

00:07:36.936 --> 00:07:40.053
pounds of apples. Now what happens in a

00:07:40.053 --> 00:07:43.121
surplus situation? Well,
apples won't stay good

00:07:43.121 --> 00:07:46.520
forever, so maybe the
producers get a little

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:49.019
desperate. They start selling.

00:07:49.019 --> 00:07:52.059
They start reducing the price,
maybe to start attracting

00:07:52.059 --> 00:07:55.126
some consumers. They
start reducing the price.

00:07:55.126 --> 00:07:58.531
When they start seeing that
the prices are going down,

00:07:58.531 --> 00:08:00.786
and you have this glut of
apples, there're all going bad

00:08:00.786 --> 00:08:05.617
and not getting sold, the
quantity is also going to

00:08:05.617 --> 00:08:07.330
start going down.
They'll produce fewer and

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:13.121
fewer apples, so we'll move
here along the supply curve.

00:08:13.121 --> 00:08:18.725
As you decrease the price, what's going to

00:08:18.725 --> 00:08:20.192
happen to the demand curve?

00:08:20.192 --> 00:08:21.982
Well the demand is going to go up.

00:08:21.982 --> 00:08:24.120
Over here the prices was too high, so it's

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:27.870
natural for the sellers
to lower the price.

00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:30.787
When you lower the price it
also reduces the quantity.

00:08:30.787 --> 00:08:31.928
We go this way.

00:08:31.928 --> 00:08:33.787
When you lower the price
it increases demand.

00:08:33.787 --> 00:08:34.984
You go that way.

00:08:34.984 --> 00:08:37.852
If the price from the get-go were too low,

00:08:37.852 --> 00:08:39.790
then you have this huge
shortage, things get

00:08:39.790 --> 00:08:42.593
bid up. The prices go
up. As the price goes

00:08:42.593 --> 00:08:44.869
up, the suppliers want to produce more.

00:08:44.869 --> 00:08:48.120
They move up the curve.
As the price goes up

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:50.619
then the people will demand less.

00:08:50.619 --> 00:08:53.250
You see that's it's all
converging on a point

00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:55.793
right over here where
the two lines intersect.

00:08:55.793 --> 00:08:59.926
Let me do that in a ... its all
converging right over there.

00:08:59.926 --> 00:09:08.854
That's the price at which the
quantity supplied will equal

00:09:08.854 --> 00:09:13.399
the quantity demanded. We
call this, which looks like

00:09:13.399 --> 00:09:18.129
for this scenario, maybe about $2.15.

00:09:18.129 --> 00:09:20.554
Let me just write it there $2.15.

00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:23.665
We call that the equilibrium price.

00:09:25.434 --> 00:09:32.662
Equilibrium price is $2.15 a pound.

00:09:32.662 --> 00:09:35.728
It's the price at which
the quantity supplied

00:09:35.728 --> 00:09:38.388
is equal to the quantity demanded.

00:09:38.388 --> 00:09:45.063
This quantity supplied
is equal to the quantity

00:09:45.063 --> 00:09:48.271
demanded. That's the equilibrium quantity.

00:09:52.516 --> 00:09:54.984
That right over here looks like it's right

00:09:54.984 --> 00:09:59.188
about ... I don't know ... 2200 pounds.

00:09:59.188 --> 00:10:01.070
2200 pounds.

00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:03.322
Assuming that nothing
else changes, this is a

00:10:03.322 --> 00:10:06.733
good scenario for both
the consumers and the

00:10:06.733 --> 00:10:09.250
producers. They keep producing 2200.

00:10:09.250 --> 00:10:11.737
They charge this price,
and everything's happy.

00:10:11.737 --> 00:10:15.381
All the apples get sold
and none of them go bad.
