BALTZ: I recently discovered
 something disturbing

00:00:02.668 --> 00:00:05.671
while reviewing my favorite
 men's rights subreddit.

00:00:05.704 --> 00:00:08.808
There's a witch hunt
 against men in Silicon Valley.

00:00:08.841 --> 00:00:11.310
Some men are even saying
 that the feminists have

00:00:11.343 --> 00:00:14.347
"formed a cabal whose goal was
 to subjugate men."

00:00:16.015 --> 00:00:18.751
for their so-called
 sexist behavior.

00:00:18.784 --> 00:00:20.453
GAYLE KING:
Silicon Valley has been battling

00:00:20.486 --> 00:00:22.555
allegations of mistreatment
and sexual harassment

00:00:22.588 --> 00:00:24.290
of women in the workplace.

00:00:24.323 --> 00:00:26.793
The memo, which was published
in a few different publications,

00:00:26.826 --> 00:00:29.662
has sparked outrage
here in Silicon Valley.

00:00:29.695 --> 00:00:32.465
That the lack of women working
in tech is attributable

00:00:32.498 --> 00:00:34.767
to biological differences.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.370
Within days, Damore was fired.

00:00:37.403 --> 00:00:39.972
BALTZ: Some people are asking
 if men are the real victims

00:00:40.005 --> 00:00:42.675
in the tech industry,
 and I say yes.

00:00:42.708 --> 00:00:46.079
I decided to make it my mission
 to give the oppressed men

00:00:46.112 --> 00:00:48.581
of Silicon Valley a voice,
 so I reached out

00:00:48.614 --> 00:00:50.783
to a ton of men,
 but they all said no,

00:00:50.816 --> 00:00:52.085
probably
 because they were too scared

00:00:52.118 --> 00:00:53.486
to come forward
 with their stories.

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:55.988
That's when I finally found
 someone brave enough--

00:00:56.021 --> 00:00:57.824
Keith Mann.

00:00:57.857 --> 00:00:59.125
Keith had created

00:00:59.158 --> 00:01:00.960
a successful e-commerce site
 called "Witchsy."

00:01:00.993 --> 00:01:02.595
So I went to go meet him

00:01:02.628 --> 00:01:04.097
in his home office
 in Los Angeles

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:05.098
to hear the full story.

00:01:05.131 --> 00:01:06.132
Hi.

00:01:06.165 --> 00:01:07.900
-Hi. -I'm Penelope.
-I'm Tim.

00:01:07.933 --> 00:01:09.102
-Hi. I'm Kate.
-Nice to meet you.

00:01:09.135 --> 00:01:10.937
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you, too.

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.840
Uh, I am here to see your boss,
Keith Mann.

00:01:13.873 --> 00:01:15.108
Keith's not real.

00:01:15.141 --> 00:01:17.110
(Baltz laughs)

00:01:17.143 --> 00:01:18.611
-Okay, can I come inside?
-Yeah, come inside.

00:01:18.644 --> 00:01:19.846
-Yeah.
-All right, great.

00:01:19.879 --> 00:01:21.380
Uh, Keith?

00:01:21.413 --> 00:01:23.382
These jokesters who were
 pretending Keith isn't real

00:01:23.415 --> 00:01:25.651
are Penelope Gazin
 and Kate Dwyer,

00:01:25.684 --> 00:01:28.121
the founders of Witchsy, 
 an e-commerce site

00:01:28.154 --> 00:01:30.356
that specializes in weird art
 that I don't get,

00:01:30.389 --> 00:01:32.692
and frankly,
 find pretty disgusting.

00:01:32.725 --> 00:01:36.129
So explain to me how you think
Keith Mann saved your business.

00:01:36.162 --> 00:01:37.897
-We just...
-Well, we-we created him.

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:39.432
Yeah. He's not real.

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:48.341
I pretended
to be Keith on e-mails.

00:01:48.374 --> 00:01:52.278
-Uh... -I made the e-mail
"KeithMannWitchsy@gmail."

00:01:52.311 --> 00:01:55.515
Because he was too busy
to create the e-mail himself.

00:01:55.548 --> 00:01:58.084
Again,
he's not a real person, so...

00:01:58.117 --> 00:02:00.887
BALTZ: You got to be frickin'
 (bleep) me, ladies.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.222
Why would anybody
 make up a fake man?

00:02:03.255 --> 00:02:04.590
GAZIN:
 We fabricated him

00:02:04.623 --> 00:02:06.659
because we needed a buffer

00:02:06.692 --> 00:02:09.228
when e-mailing
with coders and developers.

00:02:09.261 --> 00:02:10.763
Every time we would communicate

00:02:10.796 --> 00:02:12.865
or e-mail
with a specific developer,

00:02:12.898 --> 00:02:14.467
he would never address us
by name,

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.136
but Kate noticed that whenever
she would use Keith's e-mail

00:02:17.169 --> 00:02:21.007
to contact him, he always start
every e-mail with, "Keith."

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.676
There were just quicker
responses, more yeses,

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:26.679
less excuses every time
that we used the Keith e-mail.

00:02:26.712 --> 00:02:28.447
We developed
the character of Keith.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.317
Like he, you know, has a wife.

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.319
-We created the Twitter account
for him. -Yeah.

00:02:33.352 --> 00:02:35.321
-Jokes about Mondays.
-(Baltz laughs)

00:02:35.354 --> 00:02:38.291
They're the hardest day
of the week.

00:02:38.324 --> 00:02:41.327
Oh, my God,
Mondays (bleep) suck.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.729
Keith actually was a tool
for us.

00:02:43.762 --> 00:02:44.931
We felt
we had to prove ourselves

00:02:44.964 --> 00:02:46.199
before we were given respect,

00:02:46.232 --> 00:02:48.534
whereas with Keith, he was just
automatically given it.

00:02:48.567 --> 00:02:50.303
Is this something
that you would ever do again?

00:02:50.336 --> 00:02:51.470
Yeah, I would.

00:02:51.503 --> 00:02:54.073
God!

00:02:54.106 --> 00:02:55.675
(bleep)

00:02:55.708 --> 00:02:57.076
Now I was pissed.

00:02:57.109 --> 00:02:58.945
By giving a job to a fake man,

00:02:58.978 --> 00:03:00.913
Penelope and Kate
 were taking a job away

00:03:00.946 --> 00:03:02.215
from a real man.

00:03:02.248 --> 00:03:04.584
That was sexism
 at its most despicable.

00:03:04.617 --> 00:03:06.385
After all,
 executives in Silicon Valley

00:03:06.418 --> 00:03:08.521
are only 89% men.

00:03:08.554 --> 00:03:10.456
That's not even
 in the nineties.

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:12.892
So it was time to meet
 with some real men from tech

00:03:12.925 --> 00:03:14.994
and have a bro fest
 to get to the bottom of this.

00:03:15.027 --> 00:03:18.231
But once again,
 no men would meet with me.

00:03:18.264 --> 00:03:20.766
So I had to meet with a bunch
 of women instead.

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:22.134
Yikes.

00:03:22.167 --> 00:03:24.804
These man haters are all
 Silicon Valley pros

00:03:24.837 --> 00:03:28.040
who have worked for companies
 like GoPro, Apple and reddit.

00:03:28.073 --> 00:03:29.875
I just feel like
right now there is a witch hunt

00:03:29.908 --> 00:03:32.578
out there for men
lead by feminist bullies,

00:03:32.611 --> 00:03:34.814
and it's super uncomfortable.

00:03:34.847 --> 00:03:36.148
It's not a witch hunt.

00:03:36.181 --> 00:03:38.217
So we conducted a study
with over 200 women,

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.253
uh, learning more
about their experiences

00:03:40.286 --> 00:03:41.854
with sexual harassment.

00:03:41.887 --> 00:03:44.490
They were saying that, "I don't
want to pursue a legal route.

00:03:44.523 --> 00:03:46.559
"I don't want settlements,
I don't need money.

00:03:46.592 --> 00:03:48.561
"All I want is for my company
to resolve this issue

00:03:48.594 --> 00:03:49.996
and for it to not happen again."

00:03:50.029 --> 00:03:53.699
We need a culture
where we respect everyone.

00:03:53.732 --> 00:03:55.868
-Please stop ganging up on me.
-We're trying

00:03:55.901 --> 00:03:59.138
to tell you how we feel
and how things can improve.

00:03:59.171 --> 00:04:02.074
Well,
it's not comfortable for me.

00:04:02.107 --> 00:04:04.010
Mm-hmm.

00:04:04.043 --> 00:04:07.480
She didn't give a rotten dump
 about men's feelings.

00:04:07.513 --> 00:04:09.982
These women were too focused
 on their own problems--

00:04:10.015 --> 00:04:12.051
like the fact that
 only five percent of start-ups

00:04:12.084 --> 00:04:13.386
are run by women.

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:14.820
But what about men?

00:04:14.853 --> 00:04:17.790
What... about... men?

00:04:17.823 --> 00:04:20.059
Do men have a safe space
to network without women?

00:04:20.092 --> 00:04:21.794
I mean, this seems
like a huge issue now.

00:04:21.827 --> 00:04:24.230
Anywhere and everywhere you go
is a safe space for you.

00:04:24.263 --> 00:04:25.531
I don't feel safe right now.

00:04:25.564 --> 00:04:27.900
Ooh. That actually gives me
a really great idea.

00:04:27.933 --> 00:04:30.636
I wanted to pitch my great idea
 directly to a man--

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:31.837
but surprise, surprise,

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:34.473
the men were too afraid
 to meet with me.

00:04:34.506 --> 00:04:37.043
So I found Ari Horie--
 she's the CEO and founder

00:04:37.076 --> 00:04:39.879
of Women's Startup Lab,
 as featured in Forbes.

00:04:39.912 --> 00:04:43.482
And I'm a confident man who has
 a great feeling about this.

00:04:43.515 --> 00:04:47.119
You're probably familiar
with the website LinkedIn.

00:04:47.152 --> 00:04:49.489
But I'm going
to change the game.

00:04:51.123 --> 00:04:53.359
LinkedMen.

00:04:53.392 --> 00:04:55.861
Men do not have
a safe space in tech.

00:04:55.894 --> 00:04:57.797
LinkedMen aims to make tech

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.399
a safe space for men once again.

00:05:00.432 --> 00:05:02.835
-LinkedMen...
-LinkedMen...

00:05:02.868 --> 00:05:04.970
(deep, distorted):
LinkedMen.

00:05:05.003 --> 00:05:07.039
It's a stupid idea.

00:05:07.072 --> 00:05:09.175
This is not
a charitable organization.

00:05:09.208 --> 00:05:12.178
We believe in investing in a
company that has a viable idea.

00:05:12.211 --> 00:05:14.213
Unbelievable.
 I guess it was time to go

00:05:14.246 --> 00:05:17.316
to one of the few places left
 that are still safe for men,

00:05:17.349 --> 00:05:18.584
a sports bar...

00:05:18.617 --> 00:05:19.985
or a strip club...

00:05:20.018 --> 00:05:21.320
or congress or the White House,

00:05:21.353 --> 00:05:23.723
or any boardroom, or the world
 of online video games,

00:05:23.756 --> 00:05:25.624
or Hollywood, or that
 sports theme haircutting place

00:05:25.657 --> 00:05:28.060
I've been dying to try out,
 or the South in general,

00:05:28.093 --> 00:05:30.229
or the North, also the Midwest,
 or airplane cockpits,

00:05:30.262 --> 00:05:31.764
or a Limp Bizkit concert.

00:05:31.797 --> 00:05:34.300
The world is closing in
 on us, fellas.

00:05:34.333 --> 00:05:36.336
Take refuge where you can.
