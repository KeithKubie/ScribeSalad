The Story Behind the Morton's Salt Girl

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:13.210
Most people are familiar with the “Morton”s
Salt girl“.

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:18.289
With her bright yellow dress, oversized umbrella,
and leaking container of table salt, she’s

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:21.539
an iconic figure in American grocery stores.

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.480
But who is the Morton’s girl, and where
did she come from?

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:30.050
The Morton’s story begins in the 1880s,
when a man named Joy Morton invested in a

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.119
Chicago-based salt company.

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:36.350
Salt was big business in those days, largely
fueled by the demand of the explorers and

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.440
pioneers who were settling the American West.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.690
In fact, while salt sells for just a few dollars
a pound at most grocery stores these days,

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.140
it wasn’t always so easy to come by back
then.

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.460
Salt is a critical component of any diet and
throughout history has been critical to certain

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.529
types of food preservation.

00:00:52.529 --> 00:00:56.519
Perhaps not surprisingly from that, evidence
of early human settlements are often found

00:00:56.519 --> 00:00:58.039
near sources of salt.

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:02.559
Struggles over salt have led to war in many
cases – in fact, it was the subject of skirmishes

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:05.820
between the British and the colonists during
the American Revolution.

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.690
One factor that persuaded Thomas Jefferson
to launch the Lewis and Clark expedition was

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:14.750
the rumor that a great salt mountain could
be found near the Missouri River.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.550
Given the importance of salt, it’s no surprise
that Joy Morton’s little company thrived

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:21.000
along with the growing country.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.320
As the business grew, he bought out his partners.

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:28.640
By 1910, he owned a large enough stake to
re-brand it in his name – the Morton Salt

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:29.640
Company.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.570
At about this time, Morton’s company was
also trying to solve a persistent problem.

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:39.650
Salt is “hygroscopic”, a physical property
that causes it to absorb water from the air

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:40.650
around it.

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.470
When water is absorbed, the salt tends to
clump – an inconvenient property for bakers

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:46.700
and diners.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.530
If you try to put the salt from those days
in a shaker and sprinkle it over your French

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.210
fries, you wouldn’t have much success.

00:01:53.210 --> 00:02:03.430
Morton and his team solved this problem in
1911 by adding an anti-caking agent, magnesium

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.540
carbonate, to their product.

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.200
They also put the salt in a cylindrical package
that helped keep water out.

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.210
The result was a free-flowing salt that wouldn’t
frustrate customers.

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:17.260
Morton was pleased with his innovation, but
still he faced another issue.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.660
Now that his salt came in a new and improved
form, he needed to spread this information

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:22.660
to his customers.

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:28.010
How could he get the word out to customers
that Morton salt was the brand for them?

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.270
Morton hired advertising agency N.W.

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.560
Ayer and Company to put together a marketing
campaign that would promote the anti-caking

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.210
properties of his salt.

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:40.250
The ad team came up with a long list of marketing
plans.

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.680
They pitched their most promising concepts
to the salt company’s executives, but it

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:50.180
was Morton’s son who saw genius in one of
the throwaway ideas – a little umbrella-wielding

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.080
girl, accidentally pouring salt in the rain.

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.160
The illustration epitomized wholesomeness
and innocence.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.550
It also demonstrated the value of Morton salt
– it will pour easily, even if you’re

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:01.550
standing in a rainstorm.

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:05.670
The company paraphrased an old adage for the
accompanying catchphrase: “When it rains

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:06.770
it pours.”

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:09.160
The ad debuted in Good Housekeeping magazine
in 1914.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.810
In the years since, Morton’s little girl
hasn’t aged more than a few years, but she

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.420
has made some changes to keep up with the
times.

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:21.400
The first makeover came in 1921, when her
hairdresser changed her blonde mop to straight,

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.400
dark hair.

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.970
In 1933 – as Shirley Temple’s career as
a child actress took off – she co-opted

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:28.610
the child star’s trademark curls.

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:33.220
Today, the Morton Salt Company adorns its
packages with the sixth version of the umbrella

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.480
girl – the one with the yellow dress and
a daydreaming gaze that evokes the spirit

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.360
of 1968, the year she debuted.

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.430
Despite frequent questioning from fans and
customers, Morton Salt Company maintains that

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:49.480
she is simply the creation of an ad-maker’s
imagination – there is no real girl behind

00:03:49.480 --> 00:04:06.150
the iconic image.
