00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.800
Jane Austen is loved mainly as a guide to fashionable life in the Regency period,

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.140
but her own vision of her task was radically different.

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:16.560
She was an ambitious and stern moralist.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.580
She was acutely conscience of human failings and wanted, through her novels,

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.440
to make people less selfish and more reasonable.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.320
More dignified, and sensitive to the needs of others.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:34.940
Born in 1775, Austen grew up in a small village in Hampshire, where her father was the Anglican rector.

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.660
They had high social status, but were not well off.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.360
She did much of her writing at a tiny octagonal table.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.600
She never married, though on a couple of occasions she was tempted.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.480
Mostly, she lived in the country with her sister, Cassandra.

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:52.540
The novel was her chosen weapon in the struggle to reform humanity.

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:59.400
She completed six: Sense and Sensibility, Pride and Prejudice, Mansfield Park, Emma, Northanger Abbey, and Persuasion.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.820
Some of the main things she wants to teach you are:

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:09.020
In Pride and Prejudice, Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet start off heartily disliking each other

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.400
and then gradually realize they're in love.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.020
They make one of the great romantic couples.

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.680
But why actually are they right for one another?

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.260
Austen in very clear: it's for a reason we tend not to think of very much today.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.400
Each can educate and improve the other.

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:29.500
Darcy starts of feeling superior, because he has more money and higher status.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.860
Then, at a key moment, Elizabeth condemns his arrogance and pride to his face.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:39.640
It sounds offensive, but later he admits, "Your reproof so well applied, I shall never forget.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.860
"You taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous.

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.220
"By you, I was properly humbled."

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:52.220
They suit each other because by her ease and liveliness, his mind might have been softened,

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.900
his manners improved, and from his judgment,

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:00.320
information and knowledge of the world, she must have received benefit of greater importance.

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.280
In other words, they balance each other out.

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.380
We tend to think of love as liking someone for who they are already - total acceptance.

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.480
But Austen is saying that the right person has got to be able to help us overcome our failings.

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.480
And become more mature, honest, and kind; and we need to do something similar for them.

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:24.000
Darcy and Elizabeth improve one another, and then the novelist lets them get engaged.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.480
The story rewards them because they have developed well.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:33.120
That's why the novel feels so beautifully constructed, and it illustrates a basic truth:

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.500
marriage depends on maturity and education.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:47.400
Mansfield Park starts when quiet, shy Fanny Price goes to live with her much richer cousins, the Bertrams.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.700
In social terms, the Bertrams are stars, and Fanny is a very minor character indeed.

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.780
But Austen judges by a completely different standard.

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.680
She exchanges the normal lens through which people are viewed in society,

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:05.920
a lens which magnifies wealth and power, for a moral lens, which magnifies qualities of character.

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.060
Certainly, Fanny has no elegant dresses or money and can't speak French,

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.200
But by the end of Mansfield Park, she is revealed as the noble one

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.960
while the Bertrams, despite their titles and accomplishments, have fallen into moral confusion.

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:23.580
Austen is quite frank about money.

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:29.320
In Pride and Prejudice, she explains that Mr. Bingley has an income of 4000 pounds a year - that's rather a lot -

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:34.040
while Darcy has more than twice that. Rather than feeling it's impolite to discuss money,

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.780
Austen thinks it's an eminently suitable topic for highbrow literature.

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.980
Because how we handle our finances has a huge effect on our lives.

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.760
She takes aim at two big mistakes people make around money.

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:52.240
The first is to get over impressed by it. In Mansfield Park, Julia Bertram gets married to Mr. Rushworth,

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:54.540
the richest character in all of Austen's novels,

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.780
but they are miserable together, and their marriage rapidly falls apart.

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.920
But equally, Austen is convinced that it's a serious error to get married without enough money.

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:08.500
At one point in Sense and Sensibility, it looks like Elinor Dashwood and Edward Ferrars -

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.520
who are otherwise well suited - won't be able to get married.

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:19.520
She writes, "They were neither of them quite enough in love to think that 350 pounds a year would supply them with the comforts of life."

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:23.600
Elinor takes the view that wealth has much to do with happiness.

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:29.200
Though, by wealth, she doesn't mean great luxury, just enough to live carefully in moderate comfort.

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:30.760
And Austen agrees.

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.760
Marriage without a reasonable economic basis is just a folly.

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:38.340
Austen is showing us an elusive but crucial attitude.

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:46.260
Money is in some ways extremely important, and in other ways unimportant. We can't just be for it or against it.

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:54.360
In Emma, the heroine - Emma herself - takes Harriett Smith - a pretty girl from the village - under her wing.

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.880
She wants to make her an impressive match with a smart vicar.

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:03.140
Swept away by Emma's excessive praise, Harriet turns down an offer of marriage from a farmer

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:06.160
because she thinks now that he's not good enough.

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:09.020
Though in fact, he is good-hearted and quietly prosperous.

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:14.300
Then the vicar turns out to be horrified at Emma's idea and Harriet has her heart broken.

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:19.940
The underlying point is serious, Emma is unwittingly but cruelly snobbish.

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:22.940
She's devoted to the wrong kind of hierarchy.

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:26.560
The farmer is essentially a better person than the vicar,

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:30.620
but social conventions and manners make it easy to ignore this.

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:36.660
Jane Austen is careful to give this fault to Emma, who is in many ways an enchanting character.

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:42.420
In other words, Jane Austen doesn't mock snobbery as the behavior of ghastly and contemptible people.

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:48.940
Instead, she regards the snob with pity, as someone who's in need of instruction, guidance, and reform.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.940
As we all are, in our own way.

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:55.420
Austen might have written sermons; she wrote novels instead.

00:05:55.420 --> 00:06:01.280
She doesn't tell us why her sense of priorities is important, instead, she shows us in a story

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:06.300
which will also make us laugh, which can grip us enough that we want to finish supper early to read on.

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:12.800
Upon finishing one of the novels, we're invited to go back into the world and respond to others as she has taught us.

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:17.120
To pick up on, and recoil from greed, arrogance, and pride,

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:19.740
and to be drawn to goodness within ourselves and others.

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:24.860
Sadly, the moral ambition of the novel has largely disappeared in the modern world,

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:27.920
yet it's really the best thing that any novel can do.

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:33.940
The satisfaction we feel when reading Jane Austen is really because she wants the world to be a certain way

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:36.140
and we find that immensely appealing.

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:41.780
It's the secret, largely unrecognized reason why she is such a loved writer.
