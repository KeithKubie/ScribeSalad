00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.910
Alright. I want to make a lookup that relates bands and stages.

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:04.260
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:06.530
&gt;&gt; So I've got it. I'm ready to drop it. Do

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:08.270
I drop it on bands or stages, I always forget this?

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:09.270
&gt;&gt;

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:09.590
[LAUGH]

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:13.630
So, when creating any relationship, whether it's Master Detail or Lookup

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:17.200
you should always create the relationship field on the child record.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.470
&gt;&gt; Right. Each band I want to know.

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.030
This is the stage you're pla-, playing in.

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:21.600
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.480
&gt;&gt; because each stage is going to have a bagillion bands.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.980
&gt;&gt; Yup.

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.040
&gt;&gt; All right. Okay, make sense. Right. So, Field Label, I'll call it stage.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.510
&gt;&gt; Stage.

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:30.410
&gt;&gt; It's just the stage the band is playing

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.150
in. And the fun step is that it's related to

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.750
Stages. Cool. And it already populated this stuff. So, I

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.560
save. Haha. We got our line. We got our relationship. That's pretty cool.
