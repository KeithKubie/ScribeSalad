00:00:00.478 --> 00:00:01.999
- [Voiceover] We're told, let f of x

00:00:01.999 --> 00:00:05.540
equal g of x over x
squared minus x minus six,

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:07.468
where g of x is a polynomial.

00:00:07.468 --> 00:00:09.825
Which of the following is a possible graph

00:00:09.825 --> 00:00:11.600
of y equals f of x?

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:12.865
And they give us four choices.

00:00:12.865 --> 00:00:15.663
The fourth choice is off right over here.

00:00:15.663 --> 00:00:17.428
And like always, pause the video,

00:00:17.428 --> 00:00:19.870
and see if you can figure
it out or if you were

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:22.052
having trouble with it as
I start to think about it

00:00:22.052 --> 00:00:25.066
with you, pause it anytime,
if you feel inspired.

00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:27.110
It's really important to
try to engage in the problem

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:28.920
as opposed to just watch me do it.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.462
But let's start tackling
this now together.

00:00:31.462 --> 00:00:32.403
So, this is interesting.

00:00:32.403 --> 00:00:34.667
They don't give us a lot of
information about f of x.

00:00:34.667 --> 00:00:36.268
If fact, we don't know
what the numerator is.

00:00:36.268 --> 00:00:38.485
We just know that it is a polynomial.

00:00:38.485 --> 00:00:39.995
Well, that's somewhat valuable.

00:00:39.995 --> 00:00:41.968
But they do give us the denominator

00:00:41.968 --> 00:00:43.861
and so, we can think about what are

00:00:43.861 --> 00:00:45.069
the interesting numbers, what are

00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:46.757
the interesting x-values
for the denominator.

00:00:46.757 --> 00:00:48.858
In particular, what x-values will make

00:00:48.858 --> 00:00:50.926
the denominator equal to zero?

00:00:50.926 --> 00:00:53.432
And to do that, we can
factor out the denominator.

00:00:53.432 --> 00:00:55.731
So let's see, the coefficient
on the first degree term

00:00:55.731 --> 00:00:57.530
is essentially negative one.

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.289
We can write negative
one there if we want.

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:01.559
And the constant is negative six.

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:02.988
So if we want to factor that, we can say,

00:01:02.988 --> 00:01:04.786
well, what two number,s they're product

00:01:04.786 --> 00:01:07.967
is negative six and they
add up to negative one?

00:01:07.967 --> 00:01:12.967
Well, negative three times
positive two is negative six.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.287
And negative three plus two
is equal to negative one.

00:01:18.287 --> 00:01:20.226
So I can rewrite f of x.

00:01:20.226 --> 00:01:25.226
I can say that f of x
is equal to g of x over

00:01:27.106 --> 00:01:32.106
x minus three times x plus two.

00:01:32.492 --> 00:01:34.452
So the denominator equals zero

00:01:34.452 --> 00:01:39.452
for x equals three or
x equals negative two.

00:01:39.688 --> 00:01:42.451
That's when the denominator is zero.

00:01:42.451 --> 00:01:47.451
So zero denominator. I'll
just write it like that.

00:01:47.525 --> 00:01:50.478
And so something makes the
denominator equal to zero.

00:01:50.478 --> 00:01:51.814
That tell us that we're either going

00:01:51.814 --> 00:01:53.990
to have a vertical asymptote at that point

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.988
or we're going to have a

00:01:54.988 --> 00:01:57.148
removable discontinuity at that point.

00:01:57.148 --> 00:01:58.053
And the way that that would be

00:01:58.053 --> 00:01:59.691
a removable discontinuity, let's say,

00:01:59.691 --> 00:02:01.350
if we had a removable discontinuity

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.195
at x equals three, well
that means that g of x

00:02:04.195 --> 00:02:07.237
could be factored into x minus three

00:02:07.237 --> 00:02:09.186
times a bunch of other stuff.

00:02:09.186 --> 00:02:11.113
If that was the case, the x equals three

00:02:11.113 --> 00:02:13.494
would a removable discontinuity.

00:02:13.494 --> 00:02:17.847
If x equals three does not
make g of x equal zero.

00:02:17.847 --> 00:02:21.213
So, for example, if g of
three does not equal zero,

00:02:21.213 --> 00:02:23.790
or g of negative two does not equal zero,

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.588
then these would both
be vertical asymptotes.

00:02:26.588 --> 00:02:28.933
So let's look at the choices here.

00:02:28.933 --> 00:02:32.613
So choice A, we have
one vertical asymptote.

00:02:32.613 --> 00:02:36.827
That vertical asymptote is
at x equals negative two.

00:02:36.827 --> 00:02:41.204
So it seems, this line,
let me draw this line here.

00:02:41.204 --> 00:02:43.862
This vertical asymptote, right over there,

00:02:43.862 --> 00:02:46.706
that is a line, x is
equal to negative two.

00:02:46.706 --> 00:02:48.421
So at least to be, it
seems to be consistent

00:02:48.421 --> 00:02:51.358
with that over there but
what about x equals three?

00:02:51.358 --> 00:02:53.262
This one seems completely cool.

00:02:53.262 --> 00:02:55.915
This graph is defined at x equals three.

00:02:55.915 --> 00:02:57.887
X equals three is right over there

00:02:57.887 --> 00:02:59.733
and it seems to be defined there.

00:02:59.733 --> 00:03:02.892
And this, f of x, is
clearly not defined at f,

00:03:02.892 --> 00:03:06.932
at x is equal to three
because when x equals three,

00:03:06.932 --> 00:03:08.951
the denominator is zero and

00:03:08.951 --> 00:03:11.052
dividing by zero is not defined.

00:03:11.052 --> 00:03:13.385
So even though this has
one vertical asymptote

00:03:13.385 --> 00:03:15.383
at an interesting place,
we're going to rule it out

00:03:15.383 --> 00:03:18.412
because this graph is
defined at x is equals three,

00:03:18.412 --> 00:03:21.012
even though f of x is not.

00:03:21.012 --> 00:03:25.569
We would need to see either
a vertical asymptote there

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:28.239
or a removable discontinuity.

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:30.497
Alright, here we have a vertical asymptote

00:03:30.497 --> 00:03:33.863
at x is equal to negative two and we have

00:03:33.863 --> 00:03:38.863
another vertical asymptote at
x is equal to positive four.

00:03:39.122 --> 00:03:40.980
So that doesn't make sense either.

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:42.257
This one, just like the last one,

00:03:42.257 --> 00:03:44.381
is actually defined at x equals three.

00:03:44.381 --> 00:03:48.781
We that x is equals three,
the function is equal to zero.

00:03:48.781 --> 00:03:51.497
But this function? F of
three is not equal to zero.

00:03:51.497 --> 00:03:54.784
F of three is undefined.
We're dividing by zero.

00:03:54.784 --> 00:03:56.723
So we could rule this out.

00:03:56.723 --> 00:03:58.579
Once again, at x equals
three, we need to see

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:02.375
the removable discontinuity
or a vertical asymptote,

00:04:02.375 --> 00:04:04.674
because we're not defined there.

00:04:04.674 --> 00:04:06.322
Alright, let's see choice C.

00:04:06.322 --> 00:04:11.322
We see a vertical asymptote
at x is equal to negative two.

00:04:11.558 --> 00:04:13.218
So that looks pretty good.

00:04:13.218 --> 00:04:17.420
And we see a removable
discontinuity at x equals three.

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:20.915
So this function is,
this graph is not defined

00:04:20.915 --> 00:04:24.617
for x equals three or for
x equals negative two,

00:04:24.617 --> 00:04:27.276
which is good because f is not defined

00:04:27.276 --> 00:04:29.156
at either of those
points because at either

00:04:29.156 --> 00:04:32.629
of those x-values, our f's
denominator is equal to zero.

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:36.169
So this one looks quite interesting.

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:37.388
And this would be consistent.

00:04:37.388 --> 00:04:41.416
This one would be consistent
with the, with f of x

00:04:41.416 --> 00:04:44.562
being something of the sort of,

00:04:44.562 --> 00:04:46.512
so the denominator, we already know.

00:04:46.512 --> 00:04:50.413
X minus three times x plus two.

00:04:50.413 --> 00:04:52.258
And in the numerator, we would have,

00:04:52.258 --> 00:04:54.522
since x minus three is not a vertical as-,

00:04:54.522 --> 00:04:57.181
since x equals three isn't
a vertical asymptote,

00:04:57.181 --> 00:04:59.456
it's a removable discontinuity, we must

00:04:59.456 --> 00:05:02.521
be able to factor, for this one, g of x

00:05:02.521 --> 00:05:06.364
into x minus three times something else.

00:05:06.364 --> 00:05:08.558
So that's consistent
with this one over here.

00:05:08.558 --> 00:05:09.985
So I like this choice.

00:05:09.985 --> 00:05:12.092
Now let's look at this choice, choice D.

00:05:12.092 --> 00:05:13.949
Choice D has two vertical asymptotes.

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:17.687
One at x is equal to negative one.

00:05:17.687 --> 00:05:20.334
This is negative two, so
this, x equals negative one.

00:05:20.334 --> 00:05:22.156
And this x is equal to six.

00:05:22.156 --> 00:05:24.153
Neither of them are, would coincide

00:05:24.153 --> 00:05:26.348
with what make our denominator equal zero,

00:05:26.348 --> 00:05:28.147
so we could rule this out as well.

00:05:28.147 --> 00:05:32.796
So we could feel really
good about choice C.
