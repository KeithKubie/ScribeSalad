00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:33.410
&gt;&gt; David Rubenstein: Hello.

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.780
My name is David Rubenstein and
I have the honor and privilege

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.360
of serving this year
as the cochairman

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.900
of the 16th National Book
Festival, brought to you

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.720
by the Library of Congress.

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.540
National Book Festival was begun
in 2001 and it was designed

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.320
to bring people from all over the
country together in Washington DC,

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.150
authors, people who care
about books, people who care

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.860
about literacy, as a way
of promoting literacy

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.140
and promoting books, and
it's worked quite well.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.720
I, as a young boy,
began to read books

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.540
when I first got my library
card at the age of 6.

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.730
And from that time on, I've
spent an enormous amount

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:09.580 position:56%
of time reading books, learning
from books and helping to get others

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.800
to get access to books because
in my view, if you read books,

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.910
you have a chance of
enjoying life much more,

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:16.920
but you also have a chance of
being a better human being.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.720
What we now have this
year, on September 24th

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.770
at the Walter E. Washington
Convention Center, is a gathering

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.950
of - probably be about 100,000
people and more than 100 authors.

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.450
And for those who have the
chance to come to this occasion,

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.810
I would highly recommend it
because you'll have a chance

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.380
to meet the most famous
authors in the country and from

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.330
around the world, have a chance to
hear them read from their books,

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.760 position:56%
have a chance to listen to them talk
about their books, and have a chance

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.330
to get their books autographed.

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.340
But in addition, it's a chance
for adults and children,

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.080 position:56%
it's not for just children, it's not
just for adults, it's for everybody,

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.710
and it doesn't cost anything.

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.660
It is free, so I encourage
people to take advantage

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:58.140
of this free opportunity to come to
Washington on September the 24th,

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.180
meet authors that you've read about
before, that you've wanted to meet

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.220
and having a chance to really
appreciate the importance of books.

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.390
This will be an occasion
that you will not forget.

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.620
So thanks very much for
listening to this and I hope

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:10.480
to see you on September the 24th.

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:11.970
Thank you.

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.560
&gt;&gt; Cokie Roberts: This festival is
a remarkable celebration of books

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:22.490
and reading and so having
families come to this festival

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:26.700
and understand the importance of
those books for children is one

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:32.810 position:56%
of the key elements of making this
a success, not only for the authors,

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.030
which it is, but also for the
country and that's appropriate

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.510
for our country's library to do.

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.420
of the greatest events
of each American year.

Book Festival is a phenomenon.

&gt;&gt; Guy Lamolinara: Our 16th annual
celebration of books and reading,

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.500
the Library of Congress
National Book Festival promises

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.380
to be the best we've ever had.

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.620
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: One of the really
wonderful things that we're adding

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:28.920
to the festival this year,

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.880
we've never had it
before, is a main stage.

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.030
&gt;&gt; Guy Lamolinara: And this will be
a stage for our super star authors

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.410
that will seat 2500 people.

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:41.750
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: We have Stephen
King, Karim Abdul-Jabbar,

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:47.790
Salman Rushdie, Shonda Rhimes,
Raina Telgemeier, Bob Woodward.

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.070
&gt;&gt; Guy Lamolinara: I think we
have the best lineup of authors

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:52.510
in the history of the festival.

[ Music ]

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.200
&gt;&gt; For me, I think it's
just a nexus of technology

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.500
but also the love of reading.

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.690
&gt;&gt; It's just overwhelming.

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:08.300
&gt;&gt; The Book Festival is always
a highlight of the year.

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:11.670
&gt;&gt; Every year my wife and
I mark it on our calendar.

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:14.160
&gt;&gt; I think it's special
because other kids, like me,

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.460
who are interested in books get

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:17.180
to learn more information
and more things.

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.450
&gt;&gt; It's huge, you know, because
everybody comes here for books.

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:22.320
It's what the whole thing's about.

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.540
&gt;&gt; It's kind of like a gathering
point of literary Washington.

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:27.220
&gt;&gt; I went the first year
in 2008 and after that,

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:30.510
I just come every single year
because I have so much fun.
