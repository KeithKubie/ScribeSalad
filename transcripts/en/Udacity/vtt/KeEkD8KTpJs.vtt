00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:01.960
So let's do it. Let's calculate mean

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:04.320
and standard deviation. And to do that, let's

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:08.430
think back to our example with stores and

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:11.486
sales. And let's say the question we want to

00:00:11.486 --> 00:00:15.430
answer is, is there any correlation between the

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:18.410
day of the week and how much money

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.408
people spend on various items? And what's interesting

00:00:22.408 --> 00:00:25.400
about this design pattern is that all the

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:31.208
mapper has to do is, I'll put the day of the week as a key, so maybe Monday, and

00:00:31.208 --> 00:00:35.060
the value of a sale, maybe $5.20 as a value.

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.500
That's it. What does that leave for the reducer? Well,

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.570
it leaves all the math for the reducer. And the

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.850
general reason for this rule of thumb, for what the

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:45.990
mapper and reducer are doing, comes from the fact that

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:50.540
oftentimes with these, with these summary statistics, you sort of need

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.180
to know all of the statistics or all of

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.110
the parent data before you can make any calculations. So

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:58.230
we don't want to jump the gun and have the mapper

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.030
do calculations before it's ready. So why don't you go

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.310
ahead and calculate the mean and standard deviation for

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:07.050
sales for each day of the week, to help us

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.590
try to answer this question. If there's any correlation between

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.780
the day of the week and how much people spend.
