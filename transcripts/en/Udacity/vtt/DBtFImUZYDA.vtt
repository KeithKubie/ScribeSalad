00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.390
The code first computes the altitude. It then uses this position to figure out

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:07.510
how much length is left to share among the other two coordinates, x and z.

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:11.136
Their positions are computed and multiplied by this length. Since cosine

00:00:11.136 --> 00:00:14.831
squared plus sine squared equals 1. We know that all this length will be used

00:00:14.831 --> 00:00:16.879
up between the x and z components.
