1
00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.220
P A to hold on. Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad wow, that wasn't big. Sorry.

2
00:00:04.221 --> 00:00:06.930
I was just feeling it. I was feeling it. [inaudible] I'm Robert Krulwich.

3
00:00:06.931 --> 00:00:09.060
This is radio lab. We, yeah, we have been,

4
00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.040
and we shouldn't be laughing cause we'd been listening to a really,

5
00:00:11.041 --> 00:00:16.041
really sad story about a chimp named Lucy who was born as a chimp,

6
00:00:16.471 --> 00:00:21.471
raised as a human and died in well under because she ran into a human that she

7
00:00:21.901 --> 00:00:24.090
trusted and probably shouldn't have. Yeah.

8
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.010
And so the question that we want to ask now,

9
00:00:26.011 --> 00:00:28.140
and we asked this question to Charles Siebert, you know,

10
00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.510
guy who wrote a lot about chimps is,

11
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.950
what's the lesson that we should draw from this? It's good question.

12
00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.250
<v 1>I think what it says,</v>

13
00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.850
it points back to something they said earlier that the only option now in the

14
00:00:41.311 --> 00:00:45.450
best way to dignify and honor what they are,

15
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:46.440
who they are,

16
00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.950
they're more than once is to fence them ourselves off from them in little

17
00:00:53.281 --> 00:00:58.140
pockets of their home that we leave alone.

18
00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:00.180
That would be coexistence

19
00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:05.350
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

20
00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:06.940
<v 3>if you can't do it that way.</v>

21
00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.520
And there's a very good reason why he couldn't do it that way because they were,

22
00:01:09.521 --> 00:01:10.630
what, six now?

23
00:01:10.631 --> 00:01:15.631
6.8 billion people in the world soon to up to 9 billion to many of us,

24
00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.360
too many of them. So what do you do? Well, one thing you might try,

25
00:01:20.361 --> 00:01:22.280
I mean it's kind of a far out notion,

26
00:01:22.281 --> 00:01:26.510
but you could go back to the Lucy experiment that when we just described it

27
00:01:26.511 --> 00:01:30.770
ended very badly. Yeah, but this time you do it. How should I put this?

28
00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.440
You do it differently.

29
00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.540
This test is to displace an in Iowa where this is kind of happening,

30
00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:40.320
kind of.

31
00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.910
You sent our producer store [inaudible] to check it out and ready to go visit to

32
00:01:43.911 --> 00:01:46.550
savage Roomba. So to set things up, what was the name of this place?

33
00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.080
The great eight trust, although I think the name is kind of in flux, but anyway,

34
00:01:51.081 --> 00:01:54.550
the great ape trust, which is this place in the morning and I will wear 'em.

35
00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.790
It's kind of like a compound where they keep a very special group of Bonobos.

36
00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.120
Is it Bonobos or bone Boson? Then how do they say it? I think they say bonobos.

37
00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:04.273
Hmm.

38
00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:06.663
<v 4>[inaudible] working again.</v>

39
00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.890
<v 3>So when I got there, bill fields, who's the director of the place?</v>

40
00:02:10.891 --> 00:02:13.590
Director of scientific research, that's him right there. Hi.

41
00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.030
In banella Saudis Hill took me inside and then there's this place where they

42
00:02:18.031 --> 00:02:23.031
keep the Banabos but bill had to kind of go in there ahead of me and ask

43
00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.910
if they are ready to see me. Do you want the visitor to come see?

44
00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.630
<v 4>That's good. Okay. Alright. We're going to do,</v>

45
00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.310
we're going to bring the visitor to see you

46
00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:38.550
<v 3>and I walk into this room,</v>

47
00:02:38.551 --> 00:02:43.200
which is this kind of big concrete room [inaudible] here the rules are when

48
00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.860
they're visitors that the Benobos are kind of kept behind this fence. Oh,

49
00:02:47.861 --> 00:02:49.020
there's a fence in the room. Yeah.

50
00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.030
And just on the other side of the fence is kind of

51
00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.160
<v 0>what does look like. Is he big? He's</v>

52
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.580
<v 5>pretty [inaudible]</v>

53
00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:01.413
<v 3>big.</v>

54
00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:04.920
<v 5>Maybe if he stood completely upright, yeah,</v>

55
00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.500
<v 3>you'd be a little bit shorter than I am. But he's built and more than that,</v>

56
00:03:09.501 --> 00:03:11.690
he's just got this kind of presence

57
00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:13.503
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

58
00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.290
<v 3>chances. I mean he, he looks at</v>

59
00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.580
<v 5>you like directly in the eye. He was standing</v>

60
00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.300
<v 3>there with his arms just kind of swinging. Those fingers are amazing.</v>

61
00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.630
They're SAS office. It's not like going to a zoo.

62
00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.610
It's a little bit more like there's another person on the other side of that

63
00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:34.803
wire.

64
00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:42.263
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

65
00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.400
<v 3>here's one of the first things that Kanzi does when I come in.</v>

66
00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.590
Like there's these two and they're like a big plastic salad bowl.

67
00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.010
You take these two big plastic salad bowls

68
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.930
<v 4>down on the concrete and put his hands on him and run them</v>

69
00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:02.530
around the room.

70
00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:06.923
<v 3>A round circle?</v>

71
00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:08.163
<v 2>Yes.</v>

72
00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.440
<v 3>Slams himself up against the wire. Wow. Why?</v>

73
00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.530
What do you think he was doing? I didn't know what to say.

74
00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:19.470
<v 4>Thanks. Can you say</v>

75
00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:22.920
you did?

76
00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:28.850
Okay. What's with

77
00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:36.560
<v 6>[inaudible] microphone. So here's, here's Kanzi story. Sue,</v>

78
00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:38.490
would you remember sue from the last story?

79
00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:42.960
Susan heavy trombone after she worked with Lucy, this is about 30 years ago.

80
00:04:42.961 --> 00:04:47.880
She got Kanzi and she raised it. I mean she from a little bitty Bonobo,

81
00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:51.930
but she would, you know, carry Kanzi around with her all the time. Loving him.

82
00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:56.850
As much as I love my son, she becomes light watch movies.

83
00:04:56.851 --> 00:04:59.200
When we went to bed at night and they had a mother [inaudible].

84
00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.100
This sounds a little bit like the Lucy thing,

85
00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:07.460
but the difference here is that with Kanji we never wanted to take him away from

86
00:05:07.831 --> 00:05:08.664
his mother.

87
00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:12.570
Metatron Kanzi also has a Banaba mother Patato was born in the Congo,

88
00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:17.550
so she carried the knowledge of the bonobos culture as best she could across the

89
00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:20.250
[inaudible]. I was a member of a different species.

90
00:05:20.251 --> 00:05:21.780
I had a different kind of language,

91
00:05:21.781 --> 00:05:25.260
a human kind of language who says that the whole idea of the experiment was to

92
00:05:25.261 --> 00:05:26.750
create kind of an emotional bond,

93
00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:31.930
no bond between her and Kanzi that would fill Kanzi with an an innate desire to

94
00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:34.950
understand what I was going to say,

95
00:05:34.951 --> 00:05:38.100
to understand how it felt to want to communicate with me.

96
00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:40.290
And so pretty soon Kanzi is using this.

97
00:05:40.291 --> 00:05:43.740
They have a kind of a special keyboard with these symbols and you can touch the

98
00:05:43.741 --> 00:05:47.040
symbol. It makes a computer voice as a word. Hey,

99
00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:49.740
can you buy milk milk?

100
00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:54.150
He's using this symbol keyboard to communicate with sue

101
00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:57.470
sue Mary.

102
00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:00.290
This is the two of them sitting in front of the keyboard practicing enough.

103
00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:05.130
And how many words can you do? Go for 600 really? Yeah.

104
00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:06.110
Wow.

105
00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:10.870
And then this is where to me it just gets a z.

106
00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:14.900
As he got older, started being able to communicate without the keyboard.

107
00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:18.710
She would talk to him and he would talk back.

108
00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:20.970
Matt,

109
00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:22.670
<v 0>give me an example of what it was when I was there.</v>

110
00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:27.800
There was one point where we are outside. We're here. Cathy, where are you?

111
00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:30.920
Like Kanzi has this outside space and we're outside too,

112
00:06:30.921 --> 00:06:35.921
but he's still fenced in like before and bill and Kanzi are having this kind of

113
00:06:36.411 --> 00:06:37.850
back and forth. What's out there?

114
00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:39.073
<v 7>Can you say something?</v>

115
00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:44.630
<v 0>Kanzi seems to be saying there's something I want to show you or there's</v>

116
00:06:44.631 --> 00:06:47.400
something you need to see. It's not quite clear what's going on.

117
00:06:47.401 --> 00:06:50.550
I don't see it yet. And Bill can't quite figure it out either.

118
00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:54.510
So Kanzi takes us then from the tool side over this other place where there's

119
00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:58.020
out in the yard, there's this big pit for down here and look at that.

120
00:06:58.021 --> 00:06:59.880
We can't see into, cause we're behind this fence,

121
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.000
but Kanzi is basically pointing down in the pit down in the hole here we go in

122
00:07:05.571 --> 00:07:10.571
the whole year to go in to look at that man and according to bill and sue saying

123
00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:15.900
there's something there. How is Kanzi saying this? I mean,

124
00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:17.820
well I mean to you and me you, it sound like,

125
00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:25.020
I mean like I, I could tell that Kanzi was gesturing at something,

126
00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:30.460
but when dangerous

127
00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:36.040
bill and sue are hearing words.

128
00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:38.340
So it was, it got pee.

129
00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:43.610
<v 7>It's got teeth, it's got big teeth and you want us to get rid of it?</v>

130
00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:48.860
Are you scared of it? Not Too much.

131
00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:51.133
You can handle it.

132
00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:56.020
<v 0>Well I can't come in there right now but I can in a little bit and we'll check</v>

133
00:07:56.021 --> 00:07:59.050
it out. We were so interested in this situation that you're hearing right here.

134
00:07:59.051 --> 00:08:03.250
It's too cold out here. I'll come on. Look, I'll come in love. What is like,

135
00:08:03.251 --> 00:08:07.720
are they really talking? So we decided to call up bill fields. Hello? Hello?

136
00:08:07.721 --> 00:08:09.700
Hello? Hello. This is bill. Hey Bill.

137
00:08:09.701 --> 00:08:13.210
So we heard a bit of tape that Soren recorded where you guys were outside and

138
00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:17.200
Kanzi was pointing in a hole or something and it just sounded like you guys are

139
00:08:17.201 --> 00:08:21.560
having some kind of real bilingual exchange. I mean,

140
00:08:21.561 --> 00:08:25.010
is that really what was happening? Yes, that's what was happening.

141
00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:29.630
We have begun to be able to decode his speech. If you say Kanzi,

142
00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:32.810
what do you want for breakfast? He'll point on the Lexa Graham keyboard.

143
00:08:32.811 --> 00:08:36.020
He wanted grapes, onions, tofu. Say, okay,

144
00:08:36.050 --> 00:08:38.660
I'm going to go tell everybody we're going to have grapes, onions, and Tofu.

145
00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:43.370
And he will just respond with right now, like vocally? Yes.

146
00:08:43.550 --> 00:08:47.690
What does that sound like? I'm going to see if I can do so.

147
00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:50.750
What's in English? Yes. Oh Man, yes.

148
00:08:50.751 --> 00:08:53.870
When he speaks to me and I understand it, it's an English.

149
00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:55.680
The first time it happened, Bill,

150
00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:58.230
he was a Grad student and he and Kanzi were outside.

151
00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:02.370
I was sitting on a stump and Kanzi was sort of in a field nearby,

152
00:09:02.371 --> 00:09:05.010
but at a certain point he says, Kanzi stopped what he was doing.

153
00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:09.600
Turned right bill, and I'll do my best to reproduce it for you.

154
00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:10.980
He said to me

155
00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:19.800
like that. He said what? He said chase, but it was very hard for him to say it.

156
00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:23.970
But don't you just ask yourself like really am I sure that's what I heard?

157
00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:26.250
Not Anymore. I used to.

158
00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:30.540
It is such a common occurrence in our lab and it's not just my experience,

159
00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:34.350
it's my staff's experiences, Sue's experience and so on. What about you?

160
00:09:34.351 --> 00:09:38.600
I mean you were there. Do you buy what he's saying? Kanzi speaks words. Ah,

161
00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:42.990
yeah. I still don't know. Yeah, I mean the science isn't there,

162
00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:45.360
but what I do buy is that there's,

163
00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:50.820
there's real communication going on and I think it may be like a new kind of

164
00:09:50.821 --> 00:09:51.950
communication, like something,

165
00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:55.360
this is something I don't think has happened anywhere else. I've,

166
00:09:55.390 --> 00:10:00.090
bill and sue have literally created a third culture,

167
00:10:00.091 --> 00:10:03.780
a culture that neither just bonobos or just human is something,

168
00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:05.250
it's something in between.

169
00:10:05.251 --> 00:10:10.251
And I think that that culture and those relationships are real.

170
00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:13.860
Yeah. Now the weird thing about that is that with all the,

171
00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:18.200
all the great things that come out of that, there are also moments of,

172
00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:22.400
of real confusion. Like what? Well, what,

173
00:10:22.530 --> 00:10:27.530
one time we had a principal investigator who was visiting the lab at that time

174
00:10:28.021 --> 00:10:32.640
and she was having a very strong disagreement with, uh,

175
00:10:32.641 --> 00:10:37.641
Dr. Savage rumbar about method and this really upset Kanzi.

176
00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:40.770
Why was the investigators screaming at sue? Or what was she doing?

177
00:10:41.010 --> 00:10:42.720
Why do you call him an investigator? Is that like,

178
00:10:42.830 --> 00:10:45.930
this is some kind of some kind of academic visitor? Is that what we need?

179
00:10:45.931 --> 00:10:48.900
That's how scientists are referred to. You have the principal investigator,

180
00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:52.650
the co-investigator, and it's not Colombo with a gun packing a gun.

181
00:10:52.651 --> 00:10:54.870
This is like just some guy from some college somewhere.

182
00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:58.320
It's a scientific investigator. Okay. So just to fill out the scene,

183
00:10:58.321 --> 00:11:03.321
you've got a Su bill and this investigator in one room and Kanzi in a different

184
00:11:03.601 --> 00:11:06.900
room behind some glass, very thick, clear glass.

185
00:11:06.930 --> 00:11:09.150
So Kanzi can actually see what's happening in their room.

186
00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:12.900
You can see that this investigator is getting angry with sue,

187
00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:15.390
his human mom getting more and more animated.

188
00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:18.450
It was professionally aggressive and loud. And what was the,

189
00:11:18.451 --> 00:11:20.760
what was the argument about, do you remember? Oh yes.

190
00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:25.020
It was about the format that we were going to use for archive video.

191
00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:29.520
That's it. Well, you know,

192
00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:31.633
been flipped over stupid.

193
00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:35.400
And as soon this lady are arguing what was Kanzi doing,

194
00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:40.440
he was banging on the window. So I, I went to, to speak to him.

195
00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:44.820
He walked into Kanzi Room Kanzi then went to the keyboard and told him,

196
00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:48.900
you have to punish that investigator for screaming at zoo. He didn't want,

197
00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:53.530
he wanted me to go in there and, and stop her from doing this.

198
00:11:53.531 --> 00:11:58.390
It was my responsibility to take care of things and that if I didn't do it,

199
00:11:58.690 --> 00:11:59.920
he was going to bite me.

200
00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:04.420
Were you being told man up this woman as being attacked and you're supposed to

201
00:12:04.421 --> 00:12:08.800
pound or bite that investigator and if you don't fight her, I will bite you.

202
00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:13.150
Is that essentially? Yes. And I defaulted to human culture.

203
00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:17.830
I said, Conti, I really can't go argue. I can't interfere.

204
00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:22.060
I just defaulted to the way things would happen in the human world.

205
00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:27.940
And so later I told sue that Dundee told me he was going to bite me and said

206
00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:30.580
consciously not could it by year. And um,

207
00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:33.880
24 hours later after he threatened to bite me,

208
00:12:34.030 --> 00:12:37.210
he says that sue was putting Kanzi back in his enclosure,

209
00:12:37.211 --> 00:12:40.810
but Kanzi pushed past her, ran down the hall, found bill in his office,

210
00:12:40.811 --> 00:12:45.790
came and found me and he bit me. You Bet. [inaudible] where did he bunny you?

211
00:12:46.370 --> 00:12:51.190
Um, on the hand. It was, it was really serious. Uh, I lost a finger.

212
00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:52.570
Jeez.

213
00:12:52.570 --> 00:12:55.720
What happened was the hand would spit and then they had to reattach all of the

214
00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:59.220
ligaments. Southern rest of my hand would work. Wow.

215
00:12:59.290 --> 00:13:02.440
I had three surgeries that week. The first one was 14 hours.

216
00:13:02.441 --> 00:13:06.580
The next one was about eight hours and the third one was about three hours.

217
00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:11.670
But the problem was I apparently had sensitivities to drugs we didn't know about

218
00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:14.530
and they had given me morphine and I arrested.

219
00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:18.730
It stopped my breathing and my heart. You almost died? Yes.

220
00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:21.460
Wow. Is there,

221
00:13:21.570 --> 00:13:24.130
did you think if you'd been there then he wouldn't have beaten you?

222
00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:28.360
I'm certain of it. Yeah. So what did you do then? I mean,

223
00:13:28.361 --> 00:13:31.510
did you just come back to the lab and then nothing happened or,

224
00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:35.620
I came back to the lab about 14 days after the event. Um,

225
00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:41.080
I was not ready to, but, uh, I, I didn't know what else to do,

226
00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:46.180
but for eight months I didn't speak to z and he kept trying to make up with me.

227
00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:50.140
How would he do that? Would he, would he, he typed in his keyboard, sorry.

228
00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:53.620
He never, he would, he refuse to tell me he was sorry.

229
00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:57.520
But he would keep calling me bill since he'd use the keyboard to ask the other

230
00:13:57.521 --> 00:14:00.850
researchers to get bill, get bill and what do you want me to do?

231
00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:04.930
She's come down and renew my friendship with them and just act like nothing had

232
00:14:04.931 --> 00:14:08.620
happened. And, uh, I simply wouldn't go and see him.

233
00:14:08.621 --> 00:14:12.250
And suet came to me and tried to talk me into going into same and I said,

234
00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:15.460
we're in cons. He's ready to apologize, but she come back and say, no,

235
00:14:15.461 --> 00:14:19.510
cause he's not gonna apologize. He doesn't think he should. And, uh, I,

236
00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:23.470
I just stood on my ground, you know. Kenzie's gonna apologize to me.

237
00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:26.650
Finally, one afternoon and eight months later,

238
00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:28.720
one of his colleagues came up to him and,

239
00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:31.180
and told him kinds he wants to tell you he's sorry.

240
00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:33.610
And as soon as I got down there,

241
00:14:33.611 --> 00:14:38.410
he threw his body up against the wire pressing up against me and he just

242
00:14:38.411 --> 00:14:42.790
screamed and screamed in my mouth, which was this very submissive scream.

243
00:14:43.570 --> 00:14:45.340
It was very clear. He was sorry.

244
00:14:45.341 --> 00:14:49.000
And he was trying to make up with me and I asked him on the keyboard,

245
00:14:49.001 --> 00:14:52.560
are you sorry? And he told me yes. And when you,

246
00:14:52.630 --> 00:14:55.400
when you say he threw himself against the Y, I mean against the,

247
00:14:55.401 --> 00:14:58.550
against the separating device between you and him. Yes.

248
00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:01.940
Anus pressed his body up against that wire.

249
00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:06.230
And so I put my body up against him and we just pressed up against each other.

250
00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:09.110
Do you see what's happening here?

251
00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:13.370
You're telling us a story which reads more and more and more like a soap opera

252
00:15:13.371 --> 00:15:15.590
between a community of beings.

253
00:15:16.070 --> 00:15:21.070
The fact that one of them is a little Bonobo and the other one is a guy is

254
00:15:21.081 --> 00:15:22.910
almost incidental to this story.

255
00:15:22.911 --> 00:15:26.780
It's like I could put this on channel five if I wanted. It's,

256
00:15:27.650 --> 00:15:28.510
<v 6>it's just private</v>

257
00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:35.710
[inaudible] just pregnancy

258
00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:42.453
[inaudible] man.

259
00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:47.570
<v 3>Currently the great ape trust is, it's not just Kanzi.</v>

260
00:15:47.571 --> 00:15:51.530
There's about seven different Banabos there and a dozen or so kind of staff and

261
00:15:51.531 --> 00:15:54.680
researchers and while they're certainly not the same,

262
00:15:55.010 --> 00:15:59.030
they have created at the very least some, some middle ground.

263
00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:01.550
And for sue,

264
00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:07.300
that's not about a solution to any conservation problem or some scientific

265
00:16:08.061 --> 00:16:11.750
breakthrough. It's, it's something deeper and more personal.

266
00:16:11.850 --> 00:16:14.010
<v 8>When I am with Bonobos,</v>

267
00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:19.640
I feel like I have something that I shared with him long ago,

268
00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:22.740
but I forgot.

269
00:16:24.130 --> 00:16:27.520
As we've closed ourselves and separated ourselves,

270
00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:29.560
we've gained a wonderful society,

271
00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:34.800
but we've lost a kind of soul to soul connection that they maintain

272
00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:39.890
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

273
00:16:39.890 --> 00:16:44.500

276
00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:52.720
I have things that that they don't have.

277
00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:58.240
I feel like if I could have their abilities and keep mine

278
