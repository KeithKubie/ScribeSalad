00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:03.000
MIKE: We're going through the
house, buying a lot of stuff,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.470
and Steve and I haven't
forgot about the tandem deal.

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:08.900
All right, I've been thinking
about the bike a lot.

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:09.900
STEVE: OK.

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.530
MIKE: So your
grandfather made this?

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:13.100
STEVE: He had a master
welder at one point.

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:14.500
MIKE: I was going to
say, because-- man,

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.530
I mean, if you look at the--

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:18.130
the-- the lug work
and everything--

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:18.670
STEVE: He wouldn't-- he
wouldn't have done that himself.

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:19.770
Yeah, sure.

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.400
MIKE: You can't ride
this bike by yourself.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.670
You have to have two
people to balance it.

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.000
So you know, forget about all
the dating apps out there.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.270
You know, you really
want to challenge

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:29.000
somebody on the first date?

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.930
Get them on something like this.

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:32.330
Whoa!

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:33.330
It's fixed gear.

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:34.330
It's direct drive.

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:35.400
There's no brakes!

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.500
If you're riding on
the boardwalk, you--

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.500
[laughter] you kind
of don't need them.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.500
FRANK: You've got
to-- you've got

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:40.830
to be in sync with your person.
- Yeah.

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:42.700
Well, yeah-- but you just
got to-- you got to control--

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.000
control it with
your legs, you know.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.370
Right.

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:47.600
MIKE: Now, over the years, the
rims have been changed out.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:48.670
The pedals are different.

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:50.100
The seats are different.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.730
So when I'm looking at
this, I'm looking at it

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.130
from like a novelty aspect.

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:56.400
It's interesting.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.070
It's different, but, like,
as far as collecting goes,

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.900
this is not a big money bike.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.030
Is it desirable?

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:03.530
Yes, it is to the right person.

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:04.830
I-- I'm thinking like--

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.200
I don't know, like
maybe 300 bucks.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.500
[music playing]

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.030
I was thinking 400.

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.900
I think 3 is a little low.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.770
MIKE: How about 350 on it?

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.200
How about I meet
you halfway at 375?

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.370
MIKE: You like it, Frankie?

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:22.200
I like it.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.470
I-- I've never seen one before.

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:25.930
See, he's not even a
bike guy, and he likes it.

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:27.100
So 375.

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.030
Done.

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:29.430
MIKE: I appreciate it.

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.530
There's a little bit of
room on the back end.

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.730
But what I want to do is
push that story forward.

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:38.870
This is from a family, three
generations, bicycle shop--

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:40.530
this is something
that's going to be

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.470
fresh onto the market for a
bicycle collector to enjoy.

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:45.330
Take that.

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:46.970
There you go.

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:48.330
I got this.

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.770
STEVE: I know that they have
an appreciation for this stuff.

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:52.670
Take it easy on the toys.

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.630
You got Frankie's
treasure chest.

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.900
Steve's been walking
through memory lane today.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.530
And honestly, it's been
like that for me too.

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.170
FRANK: Steve, we appreciate it.

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.300
Thank you both.

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.470
MIKE: You feel connected
on a lot of these picks,

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.770
but today was extra
special for me.

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:07.930
[honking]

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:09.330
Roll on, Steve!

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.330
Thanks, guys.
