00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:17.910
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Hi everybody.

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.660
Welcome to what promises to be
an exciting afternoon of music

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.590
by Milton Babbitt and
Arnold Schoenberg.

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:24.960
My name is David Plylar.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.270
It is my pleasure to introduce
our guest lecturer today,

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:29.570
whose articles, books,

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:31.800
and lectures have made
significant contributions

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.720
to our understandings
of his subjects.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.040
Walter Frisch is the H.
Harold Gumm and Harry

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.830
and Albert von Tilzer Professor
of Music at Columbia University

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:43.600
in New York, where he
has taught since 1982.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.360
He was also then a guest
professor at the University

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.140
of Freiburg in Germany,
Yale University,

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.950
Princeton University, and the
University of Pennsylvania.

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.570
He has lectured on music
throughout the United States

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.630
and in England, France,
Spain, Germany, and China.

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:00.670
His writings have been
translated into French, German,

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.940
Spanish, Italian,
Japanese, and Chinese.

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.450
Professor Frisch is a specialist
in the music of composers

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.920
from the Austro-German sphere
in the 19th to 20th centuries,

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.490
ranging from Schubert
to Schoenberg.

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.170
Among many other things, he
has written numerous articles

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.000
and two books on Brahms, and
was the founding president

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.910
of the American Brahms
Society in 1983.

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.940
Professor Frisch's publications
on Schoenberg included the book

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.470
"The Early Works of Arnold
Schoenberg, 1893-1908"

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.020
and the edited volume
"Schoenberg and His World".

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:33.890
His book "German Modernism:

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.530
Music and the Arts" investigates
the relationships between music

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.220
and its cultural
context in Austria

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.290
and Germany during the
period of 1880 to 1915.

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.010
Professor Frisch serves as a
general editor of a new series

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.980
of period music histories
from W.W. Norton,

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:50.940
"Western Music in Context".

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:52.240
His volume in the series,

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.380
"Music in the Nineteenth
Century" was published

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.150
in the fall of 2012.

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.840
His book Arlen and Harburg's
"Over the Rainbow" appeared

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.450
in September of 2017, is part

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.650
of what I understand might
be an ongoing project.

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.860
Professor Frisch has twice won
the ASCAP-Deems Taylor Award

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.700
for his writings and he's
also been awarded fellowships

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.920
from the National
Endowment for the Humanities,

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.140
the Alexander von Humboldt
Foundation in Germany,

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.220
and the Center for
Scholars and Writers

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.020
at the New York Public Library.

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.510
Please join me in welcoming our
guest speaker Walter Frisch.

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:27.850
[ Applause ]

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:29.150
&gt;&gt; Walter Frisch: Thank
you very much David

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.170
for that kind introduction.

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.800
I want to first thank
the Library of Congress

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.100
for inviting me here today.

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.990
And it's been a pleasure-- I
think this is the fifth time

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:45.070
that I've had the privilege
of speaking at the Library

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:47.600
of Congress or in connection
with events dating back

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.380
to the very beginning
of my career.

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.260
David mentioned 1983 Brahms--

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.730
The American Brahms Society
was founded at a meeting

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.370
in the Library of Congress in
1983, at which I was present

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.780
and it's always been a
privilege and a pleasure

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.210
to not only be able to
participate in events like this,

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:07.500
but the research that I've
been able to do at the Library

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.970
of Congress over many
years on various topics,

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:15.170
most recently the
American popular song

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:16.560
of Harold Arlen and others.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.660
And you know, I just want
to shout out, as a word,

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.850
not only to the values
and the resources

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.730
of this great institution but
to the people who work here

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.640
like David and the other
curators and librarians

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.130
and specialists that have, you
now, been so wonderfully helpful

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.700
over the years to me, myself,
and many, many researchers

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.160
and probably don't get
enough credit for that.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.410
So anyway, that's a personal
note of my relationship

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.700
to this great institution.

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:53.430
So today, we're going
to be hearing a concert

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.770
that features two composers

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:58.530
of high modernism
in the 20th century.

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.080
When I say high modernism,
music that was understood

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.870
by the composers
themselves and the audiences

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.830
as very contemporary and very
often demanding and often

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:11.680
as seen as evolving or
having evolved from the music

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.110
of the later 19th century,

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:16.100
the sense of progressing
into modernism.

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.500
For Schoenberg and
Babbitt, this modernism

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.680
or this mission involved
among other things the serial

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.680
or twelve-tone method
of composition,

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.220
which was essentially invented
or developed by Schoenberg

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:32.710
in the 1920s as a new way of
organizing the pitch materials

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:37.620
of music without reference to
traditional scales or keys.

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.890
And Schoenberg was very proud
of this as were his pupils,

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:43.190
the famous comment that he
may or may not have made

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:47.230
about I have just managed
to ensure the hegemony

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:49.570
of German music for
the next hundred years,

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:51.220
Schoenberg supposedly said,

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:53.850
we're not sure whether
he said that.

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:58.670
And in the next generation
or a little bit beyond,

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:01.320
Babbitt became the greatest
exponent of the serial method

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:04.660
in the United States
beginning in the late 1940s.

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:09.050
So there's a kind of continuity
in a way across continents

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:11.420
between Schoenberg and Babbitt.

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:15.490
And the pictures you see here
were not chosen by me at random

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:18.890
because they show Schoenberg
and Babbitt in the classroom

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:21.790
with blackboards, if you
remember what those were,

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:24.630
working as teachers
and his instructors.

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:27.360
This was an important
part of their mission

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:31.330
and their priorities
as musicians.

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.520
They were both among the
most important teachers

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:37.930
of music composition and music
theory of the 20th century.

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:41.820
Schoenberg in Vienna, in Berlin,
and then later in Los Angeles

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:43.780
at USC and particularly UCLA

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:47.350
where this photograph was
most likely taken at UCLA.

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:51.040
You can even try and
follow the harmonic analysis

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:54.950
of a three chord there
on one of his classes.

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:57.500
And then Milton Babbitt,
of course at Princeton,

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:00.710
which where this photo was most
likely taken and then later

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:04.410
at Julliard in the
latter part of his career.

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:06.660
So Babbitt was one of
the first proponents

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:08.850
of Schoenberg's music
in the USA.

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:11.820
Babbitt had come to New York
in the early '30s to study

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:14.540
at NYU having given up
mathematics and the idea.

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:16.660
And he actually met
Schoenberg shortly

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:19.380
after Schoenberg
arrived in this country.

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:20.680
He's one of the first people--

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:23.870
He was introduced to him by
Lehman Engel, the conductor.

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:26.520
Schoenberg was at that time
living at the Ansonia hotel

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:30.330
in New York and Babbitt
got to meet him

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:32.340
and Babbitt was probably
one of the few people

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:35.160
who had really tried to
understand Schoenberg's music.

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:37.740
Babbitt often makes the
point that very few scores

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:39.780
of Schoenberg's music
were available or

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:41.750
but much more modern music
at that time and he managed

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:44.210
to get a hold of one piano
piece of Schoenberg's

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:45.670
and he was fascinated.

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:50.180
So they had very little personal
contact I think after that,

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:53.370
because Schoenberg moved to
Los Angeles for health reasons

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:56.700
and others and Babbitt
stayed on the east coast.

00:06:56.700 --> 00:07:01.640
But both of them remained
active as not only as theorists

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:04.580
and composers but as writers.

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:08.020
And these two, Schoenberg's
writings were collected

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:12.410
in famous collection of essays
that he put together originally

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:17.580
in the early '50 or
1950 style and idea.

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:24.100
And later on in 2012, just
after Babbitt's death,

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:27.790
his essays were collected
in this.

00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:31.030
And I would say these two
collections are among the most

00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:34.560
important writings on
20th century music or--

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:37.930
and other music and certainly
among the most important

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:39.660
writings by composers.

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:42.180
They are classic collections.

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:45.010
It's really wonderful to
read Babbitt's essays put

00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:46.310
together here.

00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:49.630
He didn't necessarily-- or
maybe he consulted on it.

00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:52.600
But the range going back
in time and his connection

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:58.360
to musical traditions was
as profound as Schoenberg's.

00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:00.980
So I highly recommend
both books to you.

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:06.070
So Arnold Schoenberg's String
Quartets which we'll hear two

00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:11.370
of today, quite remarkable, for
him as for many other composers

00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:15.410
in the 20th century, say Bartok,
Shostakovich, Elliot Carter,

00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:18.540
Milton Babbitt, the
quartet was a very important

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:20.530
and fruitful medium more than--

00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:24.940
I would say more than any other
older genre including symphony

00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:27.980
or even opera I would say
that the way this carries--

00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:29.280
the String Quartet carries

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:33.530
over into the 20th
century is very striking.

00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:35.570
And last night for those
of you who were here,

00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:38.640
we heard how interesting the
String Quartet continues,

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:42.380
that Elliot Smith's and George
Lewis's work remarkable,

00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:44.950
contemporary works
so that the medium

00:08:44.950 --> 00:08:47.810
of the String Quartet
continues to offer possibilities

00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:49.980
and fascination for composers.

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:53.230
So Schoenberg's published
for a quartet in his time

00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:57.640
and then there's an earlier
work also on by the Library

00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:00.020
of Congress in manuscript that--

00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:02.630
I'm sorry, a student
work from 1897

00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:05.740
which was only published later
very much in the idiom of Brahms

00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:07.440
and Dvorak but a
quite a good work.

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:12.210
So of Schoenberg's published
quartets, the first two date

00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:15.630
from his sort of total
period and the latter two are

00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:17.570
in the twelve-tone idiom.

00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:21.390
But it's sort of striking
when you think about it

00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:25.330
that in some ways, in respect
to the norms or traditions

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:27.140
of the String Quartet genre,

00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:29.770
the first two are more
radical in many respects.

00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:33.000
And I'll discuss the
First Quartet in a moment,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.010
which is in one long movement.

00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:39.140
And for opus 10, the Second
Quartet, a voice is introduced

00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:42.390
in the second-- third and fourth
movements, it's quite striking.

00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:46.530
And the third and
Fourth String Quartets,

00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:49.460
although they use the
twelve-tone method and are,

00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:52.000
you know, very advance
in that way are in fact

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.260
in the standard form
movements of the genre

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:57.330
and they very much align with
the sort neoclassical movement

00:09:57.330 --> 00:09:59.910
of the 1920s and '30s
that you might be familiar

00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:01.400
with from Stravinsky and
[inaudible] and others.

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:06.350
And as such, Schoenberg's third
and Fourth Quartets are sort

00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:08.960
of closer to the Haydn
and Beethoven tradition

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:12.050
of the quartet then are
the first two quartets.

00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:15.720
And interesting, the reception
of these quartets mirrors

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:17.720
that in a way because
the first string--

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:21.370
both two first two String
Quartets caused disturbances,

00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:25.430
even riots depending on how you
look at it at their premieres.

00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:30.050
The First String Quartet was
premiered in 1907 and, you know,

00:10:30.050 --> 00:10:32.280
people started hissing or
blowing on their house keys,

00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:33.870
that was what you did in Vienna,

00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:36.550
to express disapproval
at that concert.

00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:37.850
And at that concert,

00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:40.650
one of Schoenberg's early
supporters was there,

00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:44.650
Gustav Mahler, who was very
prominent in Vienna as the head

00:10:44.650 --> 00:10:48.990
of the Hofoper, the court opera
and was quite a, you know,

00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:53.100
enthusiast or let's say a
supporter of Schoenberg.

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:54.730
And so Mahler, who
wasn't very tall,

00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:56.390
nonetheless stood
up at this concert.

00:10:56.390 --> 00:10:58.530
This is when opus
7 was premiered,

00:10:58.530 --> 00:11:01.130
and said to somebody
behind him or around him,

00:11:01.130 --> 00:11:03.150
"How dare you hiss
at this work?"

00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:05.990
So this person actually
was a pretty good--

00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:08.240
pretty good response
said, that's OK,

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:10.280
I hiss at your symphonies
too [laughter].

00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:13.830
That apparently really happened.

00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:17.620
And the Second String Quartet,
also in December of 1908,

00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:22.110
caused a big ruckus in the
concert hall that lasted

00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:25.020
at least for the first movement
and then quieted down a bit.

00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:27.880
Whereas the Third String
Quartet, when it was premiered

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:32.200
in 1927, was actually kind of
a triumph for Schoenberg's.

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:35.260
He was called to the stage
many times or several times

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:37.610
and it was quite well
received, even though again,

00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:42.640
this was in the sort of more
radical twelve-tone idiom.

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:45.910
So it's interesting in that
regard how Schoenberg's quartets

00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:48.900
evolved across his
career in that respect.

00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:51.580
So, the First String
Quartet of Schoenberg--

00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:55.470
the first numbered String
Quartet, opus 7 from 1905,

00:11:55.470 --> 00:11:58.860
I believe the manuscript is
out there for you to see is one

00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:00.570
of the treasures of
the Library of Congress

00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:02.760
that I think the
composer himself sold

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:05.580
to the library in the 1950.

00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:11.780
And here is the first page
of this work from the time.

00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:16.070
And just a few features of
it, this remarkable work

00:12:16.070 --> 00:12:19.670
which last almost 50
minutes in performance,

00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:23.120
so you're in for an experience
and you can't get up and go

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:25.990
to the bathroom because it's
one continuous movement,

00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:29.310
it's highly contrapuntal,
the opening theme,

00:12:29.310 --> 00:12:32.210
I don't know whether you
can see it or follow it,

00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:35.890
is actually a composite
of three different lines.

00:12:35.890 --> 00:12:38.760
And in a way, they are
all equally important

00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:40.760
and then Schoenberg flips
them at various points

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:43.650
in the quartet, very linear
kind of writing and at least

00:12:43.650 --> 00:12:45.990
to a very high level
of dissonance.

00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:47.830
And Mahler famously--

00:12:47.830 --> 00:12:51.260
or Schoenberg reports that
Mahler said about this,

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:52.560
Mahler is looking
through the score

00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:56.220
of the First String Quartet
and says, this is amazing.

00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:58.360
He said, I've written my self
scores and up to, you know,

00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:01.840
30 or 40 parts and here's
a score with four lines

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:05.140
and I can barely read it or can
barely grasp it, said Mahler.

00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:07.980
So even he was-- So as I say,

00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:09.810
it's in one long
continuous movements

00:13:09.810 --> 00:13:12.430
and interestingly
the piece divides--

00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:16.460
it's very original and form, it
divides into four large sections

00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:18.990
that align with the traditional
classical movement types.

00:13:18.990 --> 00:13:21.280
So you have a sonata
form first movement,

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:24.290
[inaudible] a slow
movement and the finale.

00:13:24.290 --> 00:13:26.840
But then interestingly,
Schoenberg's superimposes

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:31.180
on that design, a kind of
elements of a sonata form

00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:34.300
in which the traditional
exposition, development,

00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:37.330
recapitulation are
spread out across.

00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:39.840
So like you got the
exposition of the first movement

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:41.140
and then part of the development

00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:43.260
but you don't get the
recapitulation until later,

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:46.300
it's this very interesting
interwoven form.

00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:48.100
And according to Leonard Stine,

00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:50.600
his pupil when Schoenberg
would talk about this work

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:54.250
or teach it, he didn't even
needed a crib sheet so he could,

00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:56.620
you know, sort of explain
where the different parts

00:13:56.620 --> 00:13:59.840
of these two forms intersected
with each other because it's

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:03.210
so intricate, it's fascinating.

00:14:03.210 --> 00:14:06.640
And the other thing is that
Schoenberg wrote a kind

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:09.120
of program or story
that allies the work.

00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:12.260
So here's what Schoenberg
said about this quartet later

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:14.410
on when he was writing program
notes but he's referring

00:14:14.410 --> 00:14:17.880
to he says, I abandoned
program-music,

00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:21.190
which was in vogue at the time,
and turned in the direction

00:14:21.190 --> 00:14:23.820
that was much more my own
that all the proceeding.

00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:26.370
It was the First
String Quartet, Opus 7,

00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:28.270
in which I combined
all the achievements

00:14:28.270 --> 00:14:31.070
of my time including my own
such as the construction

00:14:31.070 --> 00:14:34.530
of extremely large forms,
greatly expanded melodies based

00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:37.610
on a richly moving harmony
and new chord progressions,

00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:40.530
and a contrapuntal technique
that solved problems offered

00:14:40.530 --> 00:14:44.640
by superimposed, individual
parts which moved freely

00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:46.650
in more remote regions
of a tonality

00:14:46.650 --> 00:14:48.870
and met frequently
in vagrant harmonies.

00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:50.610
That was one of his
terms for this kind

00:14:50.610 --> 00:14:52.590
of advanced harmonic language.

00:14:52.590 --> 00:14:55.820
So it's this interesting
relationship between the lines

00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:59.280
and the harmony, and
the way they line up.

00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:02.970
But the fact that he says he
abandoned program-music is not

00:15:02.970 --> 00:15:08.180
entirely true because in later
years he confessed ones--

00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:10.830
I think in the class of
UCLA there was a private

00:15:10.830 --> 00:15:14.380
but very definite
program for this quartet

00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:16.820
and people didn't really
know what that meant.

00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:20.170
And then when an editor
was preparing this quartet,

00:15:20.170 --> 00:15:22.250
the first three of quartet
for a scholarly edition,

00:15:22.250 --> 00:15:26.800
he came across something this,
so they're folded up inside

00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:28.130
in German of course,

00:15:28.130 --> 00:15:30.680
in the sketches materials
for the quartet.

00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:35.820
And so this is what the
"program" is as its written

00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:39.330
out I think by hand
and it's interesting,

00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:41.810
it's not exactly a story
but it's like a series

00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:45.680
of emotional states, revolt,
defiance, longing, rupture,

00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:49.730
dejection, despair, comfort,
relieved, she and he, new,

00:15:49.730 --> 00:15:54.080
outbreak, and you can see mild
disagreement, feeling new life,

00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:56.690
and he gives it a
three-part program.

00:15:56.690 --> 00:16:00.630
It's not clear exactly how
this aligns with peace itself,

00:16:00.630 --> 00:16:03.520
although actually in the
sketches for the [inaudible],

00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:07.190
we see feeling new life
so we know that that sort

00:16:07.190 --> 00:16:08.490
of correspond to that.

00:16:08.490 --> 00:16:11.820
Anyway, at the end, homecoming
joyful reception quite joy

00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:13.400
at the entrance of
rest and harmony.

00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:15.630
And indeed, it ends
in a very kind

00:16:15.630 --> 00:16:17.170
of consonant and beautiful way.

00:16:17.170 --> 00:16:20.840
So the fact that Schoenberg
has this program, you know,

00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:23.980
shows how even in this kind
of radical work in many ways,

00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:26.600
he is still very much
attached to and part

00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:28.230
of these 19th century
traditions,

00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:29.750
these ways of thinking
about music.

00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:32.140
He had written "Pelleas
and Melisande",

00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:34.260
he'd written "Verklarte
Nacht" "Transfigured Night",

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:37.350
he had written two big pieces
of program music before this.

00:16:37.350 --> 00:16:40.490
But again, it's coming out of a
tradition of Strauss, Don Juan,

00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:43.180
and [inaudible] whole tradition

00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:46.220
that Schoenberg was still
very much a part of.

00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:52.170
So it's interesting to have
this program and, you know,

00:16:52.170 --> 00:16:56.470
the way he thought
about these works.

00:16:56.470 --> 00:17:00.620
So the-- I'm not going to
play you much of this piece,

00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:02.410
the First String
Quartet, just a little bit

00:17:02.410 --> 00:17:04.920
because you'll be hearing
it obviously very shortly.

00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:10.610
But I'll play you a little bit
from this is the first recording

00:17:10.610 --> 00:17:11.910
of the Schoenberg's
String Quartet

00:17:11.910 --> 00:17:13.660
which also a very
famous recording,

00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:16.160
was done by the Kolisch
Quartet--

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:18.140
Rudolf Kolisch, you
see there on the right.

00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:22.060
How do we know it's Rudolf
Kolisch besides the caption?

00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:24.540
Notice anything about the
way he's holding his bow

00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:28.160
and where he's a
left-handed violinist,

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:32.070
the most famous left handed
violinist, Rudolf Kolisch.

00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:36.390
And whereas this
group, the Rose Quartet,

00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:38.130
had premiered Schoenber's
first two quartets,

00:17:38.130 --> 00:17:42.600
the Kolisch Quartet became
very much and associated

00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:43.900
with Schoenberg's later work

00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:47.400
and then Schoenberg's second
wife was Gertrud Kolisch,

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:49.680
Kolisch's sister.

00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:56.440
So this recording was made
in Los Angeles in 1930s.

00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:59.760
One of the Hollywood film
composers Alfred Newman would

00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:03.300
study the Schoenberg, got
the musicians together

00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:08.210
and rented the studio and it's
quite historic in that way even

00:18:08.210 --> 00:18:10.490
if it's a little-- the
fidelity is not that great.

00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:12.360
Anyway, here's a bit
of the opening theme

00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:14.940
that you saw the three lines,
and then I'm just going to cut

00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:17.980
to a later passage
which is very--

00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:21.200
shows some of this linearity,
this-- it's like a fugue,

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:25.770
its basically a fugue where the
four voices enter successively.

00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:28.190
But the thing is
sort of atonal fugue

00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:31.870
because the themes
don't add up to any--

00:18:31.870 --> 00:18:35.800
it's verging on atonality
because it doesn't add up at

00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:41.370
that case to any kind of
clear harmonic coherence.

00:18:42.510 --> 00:19:12.210
[ Music ]

00:19:12.210 --> 00:19:16.470
And now that fugal
passage I mentioned.

00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:44.050
[ Music ]

00:19:44.050 --> 00:19:47.640
So that's among the most
dissonant music probably

00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:50.860
that had been written
up to that time is 1905,

00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:55.460
even before the later Mahler
and before Strauss's Elektra,

00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:59.450
it's quite, quite
remarkable to have that.

00:19:59.450 --> 00:20:04.060
So about the Third quartet,
here's a picture of Schoenberg

00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:08.460
in the year of the Quartet No.3,
a famous photograph by Man Ray.

00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:13.680
Schoenberg-- You know, everybody
who knew him or very often,

00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:16.260
they spoke about his
eyes, his eyes, his gaze,

00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:18.470
Schoenberg's eye, you know,
when you were in conversation

00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:21.370
with him or in class with
him and you get something

00:20:21.370 --> 00:20:24.680
at that gaze there, sort
of some ways are fearsome

00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:26.280
looking modernist.

00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:31.240
So the Third Quartet, which of
course the manuscript is also

00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:34.080
here at the Library of Congress,
was written on a commission

00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:37.640
from Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge,
of the Coolidge Auditorium.

00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:40.300
He actually written the work
and then got the commission

00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:45.430
so he dedicated to her the
work preceded the commission,

00:20:45.430 --> 00:20:48.290
so to speak, by a little
bit but it's become

00:20:48.290 --> 00:20:50.840
as the Fourth Quartet which
was commissioned and written

00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:52.780
for Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge.

00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:55.370
And I believe maybe you
can see that manuscript too

00:20:55.370 --> 00:20:59.160
but he says Elizabeth Sprague
Coolidge commitment dedicated

00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:00.460
to her.

00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:04.590
So the Third Quartet, again,
is in the twelve-tone idiom

00:21:04.590 --> 00:21:06.370
but very strongly neoclassical.

00:21:06.370 --> 00:21:09.880
I mentioned it's very clearly
defined into four movements.

00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:11.180
The first movement is

00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:12.700
in traditional sonata
form in some respect.

00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:15.460
The second movement is
a theme in variations,

00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:17.040
another traditional
thing you would find

00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:18.690
in Haydn and Beethoven.

00:21:18.690 --> 00:21:23.120
The third movement is called the
Intermezzo but it has the form

00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:25.760
of a kind of minuet
and trio, alternating.

00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:29.790
And the finale is actually a
rondo, sections come back quite

00:21:29.790 --> 00:21:31.280
in the manner of Haydn.

00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:33.350
So this is very much part of--

00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:36.270
and people have often said
that with Schoenberg working

00:21:36.270 --> 00:21:40.670
in a fairly new language
still of the twelve-tone idiom

00:21:40.670 --> 00:21:45.550
that he-- the external
forms he made, so to speak,

00:21:45.550 --> 00:21:49.280
as traditional as possible
so that audiences, you know,

00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:51.390
would have something
to grab onto.

00:21:51.390 --> 00:21:52.690
I'm oversimplifying.

00:21:52.690 --> 00:21:55.590
But if you-- the first fully
twelve-tone work is the piano

00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:57.470
Suite Opus 25 is like a Baroque,

00:21:57.470 --> 00:22:02.160
a suite of Baroque piano
pieces and, you know, Gavotte,

00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:07.370
you know, pavane-- not pavane
but various dance forms.

00:22:07.370 --> 00:22:10.230
So again, Neo-Baroque
in that case.

00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:13.800
So that was the very
characteristic of that.

00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:17.870
And yet even here, Schoenberg
sort of still thinks back

00:22:17.870 --> 00:22:21.280
to some of the, you might say,
programmatic associations.

00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:24.640
I know that David quotes
this in your program but two

00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:27.120
that you'll have today
where Schoenberg wrote again

00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:29.330
in the notes or line or
notes around this time,

00:22:29.330 --> 00:22:32.940
"As a little boy I was tormented
by a picture of a scene

00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:37.480
of a fairytale 'The Ghost
Ship', geist or something,

00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:40.550
whose captain had been nailed
through the head to the topmast

00:22:40.550 --> 00:22:42.190
by his rebellious crew.

00:22:42.190 --> 00:22:45.190
I am sure this was not the
"program" of the first movement

00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:46.720
of the Third String Quartet.

00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:48.160
But it might have
been, subconsciously,

00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:50.420
a very gruesome premonition
which caused me

00:22:50.420 --> 00:22:52.890
to write this work, because
as often as I thought

00:22:52.890 --> 00:22:54.830
about this movement,
the first movement,

00:22:54.830 --> 00:22:56.490
that picture came to my mind."

00:22:56.490 --> 00:22:58.030
And indeed, the movement
is dominated

00:22:58.030 --> 00:23:00.850
by this repeated figure,
ta, ta, ta, ta, ta, ta,

00:23:00.850 --> 00:23:04.530
sort of could mean many
things but like I said called

00:23:04.530 --> 00:23:06.000
up this picture in
Schoenberg's mind.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:09.850
So again, very much thinking
in a 19th century way

00:23:09.850 --> 00:23:15.460
about this sort of
possibly programmatic aspect

00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:19.200
of music of his own music.

00:23:21.090 --> 00:23:25.600
So, we have-- when Schoenberg
wrote in the twelve-tone method,

00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:29.870
he often helped himself with
creating these row tables

00:23:29.870 --> 00:23:32.640
that he would-- this is from
the Arnold Schoenberg Center

00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:33.940
in Vienna.

00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:36.870
And Schoenberg loved making
contraptions and, you know,

00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:40.120
he design playing
cards and various kind

00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:43.890
of mechanical things, toys
and things for his children

00:23:43.890 --> 00:23:46.150
but also practical
things like this.

00:23:46.150 --> 00:23:48.030
So here is one of his little--

00:23:48.030 --> 00:23:50.520
you know, with the bar
that can slide up and down

00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:52.500
to show him the thing.

00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:56.930
And interesting you
see at the top there T,

00:23:56.930 --> 00:24:01.420
even at this stage T seems

00:24:01.420 --> 00:24:04.560
to represent the word
tonic or tonika in German.

00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:07.700
So that means sometimes he
called it principle form

00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:09.950
of the row but the fact
that he's still thinking

00:24:09.950 --> 00:24:11.940
of these rows, even though
they are not really related

00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:16.570
to tonality as the tonika,
as the tonic, the home key

00:24:16.570 --> 00:24:18.870
in a way, shows that, you know,

00:24:18.870 --> 00:24:22.690
you're sort of attached
to that tradition.

00:24:22.690 --> 00:24:24.410
So he could move around
these little things.

00:24:24.410 --> 00:24:26.960
And at the top, you see the row,

00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:29.910
the 12-note ordering
of the form for this.

00:24:29.910 --> 00:24:33.720
And here's that later row table
that he prepared while he was

00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:36.240
in the United States for
this Third String Quartet.

00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:39.660
And here he calls it the basic
set and he numbers the pitches 1

00:24:39.660 --> 00:24:41.820
through 12 and then he
gives you inversions.

00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:44.750
And what's interesting
about this String Quartet--

00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:49.220
the Third String Quartet is that
he uses three different forms

00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:51.150
of the row but the five--

00:24:51.150 --> 00:24:53.990
first five notes are
the same for each one.

00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:59.720
So G, E, D sharp, A, C if you
can read, but then 6, 7, 8,

00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:01.020
9, 10, 11, 12 changed.

00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:03.090
So, what he's done here is
he gives you 1, 2, 3, 4,

00:25:03.090 --> 00:25:06.970
5 and then an alternate
version of 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11,

00:25:06.970 --> 00:25:10.410
12 over the one, two,
three and fourth column,

00:25:10.410 --> 00:25:11.710
and then on the fifth column

00:25:11.710 --> 00:25:14.360
yet another ordering
of the last pitches.

00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:17.790
And in the fourth column there,
with the parenthesis underneath,

00:25:17.790 --> 00:25:20.280
he shows what the ordering
was at the beginning

00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:24.470
in the first row, 6, 8, 7,
11, those were the orderings

00:25:24.470 --> 00:25:26.440
in the basic set there.

00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:32.330
And indeed, it's fascinating
the way he works that out

00:25:32.330 --> 00:25:35.860
and it shows that it's
really just a sort of query

00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:37.260
of notes and relationships.

00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:40.110
So what he does-- I'll
play this in the second

00:25:40.110 --> 00:25:42.780
but if you can read the music,
he's got this five-note--

00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:45.830
it's eight notes but five
pitches, "pam, pam, pam, pam,

00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:48.460
pam, pam, pam, pam,
pam, pam, pam, pam,

00:25:48.460 --> 00:25:49.760
pam", not singing it right.

00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:53.710
There are notes one
through five of the row.

00:25:53.710 --> 00:25:56.720
And then six and seven--

00:25:56.720 --> 00:26:01.080
interestingly, six
and seven are here.

00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:07.130
That would be E sharp here,
whereas this is 8, 9, 10, 11,

00:26:07.130 --> 00:26:11.230
12, so he forms the
accompaniment,

00:26:11.230 --> 00:26:13.320
this constantly repeating
accompaniment of one

00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:14.700
through five and
that stays the same.

00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:16.000
Notice it keeps repeating.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.470
And then the other notes
form a melody above.

00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:22.120
So there's so many different
relationships that he can pull

00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:24.970
out of that, so that's why
he separates six and seven.

00:26:24.970 --> 00:26:29.430
Anyway, this is what that sounds
like, you know, with the sailor

00:26:29.430 --> 00:26:32.140
or the captain nailed
to the mast or whatever,

00:26:32.140 --> 00:26:34.750
but it's very interesting.

00:26:43.250 --> 00:26:47.510
Where is my sound?

00:26:47.510 --> 00:27:33.990
[ Music ]

00:27:33.990 --> 00:27:37.490
And so, even from what you've
heard, I think you can hear

00:27:37.490 --> 00:27:38.990
that Schoenberg maintains
actually

00:27:38.990 --> 00:27:41.600
to some extent the
distinction between secondary

00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:46.370
or accompaniment figures and
melodic lines that is part

00:27:46.370 --> 00:27:50.420
of the tradition of Haydn,
Beethoven, Brahms, and so on.

00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:55.720
But it now has a different
framework, not tonal anymore

00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:59.380
but based on the sort of
ordering of the 12-note row

00:27:59.380 --> 00:28:01.530
and that sort of runs
throughout this piece.

00:28:01.530 --> 00:28:05.580
And so-- And of course,
you know, Schoenberg--

00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:10.020
many of Schoenberg's pupils and
disciples spent a lot of time

00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:13.530
as if many generation since
sort of tracing out the row

00:28:13.530 --> 00:28:17.530
in every movement of Schoenberg
counting the notes, you know,

00:28:17.530 --> 00:28:18.830
this is one, two,
three, four, five.

00:28:18.830 --> 00:28:22.730
And his brother-in-law,
Rudolf Kolisch did this

00:28:22.730 --> 00:28:24.030
or I don't know, he wasn't--

00:28:24.030 --> 00:28:26.640
yeah, I guess he was his
brother-in-law about that time.

00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:31.700
For the Third Quartet and sent
this to Schoenberg, his analysis

00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:34.930
of the piece, and Schoenberg
this is a famous response,

00:28:34.930 --> 00:28:38.000
I think it's also in
your program note.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:41.110
Schoenberg writes to Kolisch
sort of admonishingly,

00:28:41.110 --> 00:28:43.090
"You have worked out the
series in my String Quartet.

00:28:43.090 --> 00:28:45.090
You must have gone to a
great deal of trouble,

00:28:45.090 --> 00:28:47.430
and I don't think I'd have
had the patience to do it.

00:28:47.430 --> 00:28:50.390
But do you think any one's
any better off for knowing it?

00:28:50.390 --> 00:28:51.810
I can't quite see it that way.

00:28:51.810 --> 00:28:54.580
My firm belief is that
for a composer who doesn't

00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:56.900
yet know quite his
way about the use

00:28:56.900 --> 00:28:59.500
of the series it may give some
idea of how to set about it--

00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:01.810
a purely technical
indication of the possibility

00:29:01.810 --> 00:29:03.510
of getting something
out of the series.

00:29:03.510 --> 00:29:05.820
But this isn't where the
aesthetic qualities reveal

00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:08.550
themselves, or, if
so, only incidentally.

00:29:08.550 --> 00:29:10.040
I can't utter too many warnings

00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:11.560
against overrating
these analyses,

00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:13.430
since after all they only lead

00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:16.560
to what I have always been dead
against, seeing how it is done

00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:19.720
or as I have always have helped
people to see what it is!

00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:21.020
I can't say it often enough,

00:29:21.020 --> 00:29:23.160
my works are twelve-tone
compositions,

00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:26.170
not 12-note compositions."

00:29:26.170 --> 00:29:29.930
So this is, you know, again,
Schoenberg repeating this.

00:29:29.930 --> 00:29:31.230
This is music.

00:29:31.230 --> 00:29:34.220
These are composition
and the series anymore

00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:37.250
than if you took a piece,
you know, the Eroica Symphony

00:29:37.250 --> 00:29:40.420
and talk about the key of E
flat major endlessly, you know,

00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:42.150
Beethoven would say, well,

00:29:42.150 --> 00:29:44.960
E flat major is not what my
Eroica Symphony is about,

00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:48.260
it's about many other things,
instrumentations and the history

00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:51.720
and so forth, so it sort of
analogous to that really.

00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:57.200
So which brings us to Milton
Babbitt, it's somewhat true

00:29:57.200 --> 00:30:01.920
of Babbitt as well the idea that
you shouldn't only be listening

00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:04.900
to the serial possibility.

00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:07.220
Babbitt often struggle
against the reception

00:30:07.220 --> 00:30:09.250
and perception of his works.

00:30:09.250 --> 00:30:12.110
And arguably he was
doing so in an era--

00:30:12.110 --> 00:30:17.070
post-war era concert world
where it was even more polarized

00:30:17.070 --> 00:30:20.730
with people unwilling
to a very small group

00:30:20.730 --> 00:30:22.920
of new music fanatics
and then other people

00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:28.370
who were not interested in this
repertory or in these concerts.

00:30:28.370 --> 00:30:32.220
And in one of the most
famous-- infamous essays really,

00:30:32.220 --> 00:30:34.230
of the later 20th century,

00:30:34.230 --> 00:30:36.380
appearing in High
Fidelity magazine,

00:30:36.380 --> 00:30:41.210
Milton Babbitt wrote this
essay about this phenomenon

00:30:41.210 --> 00:30:43.940
and it was entitled "Who
Cares if You Listen?"

00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:46.290
Which actually it turns
out was not his own choice

00:30:46.290 --> 00:30:47.590
of title at all.

00:30:47.590 --> 00:30:49.660
The editor put it on
but also surrounded

00:30:49.660 --> 00:30:52.130
in this forbidding black.

00:30:52.130 --> 00:30:55.890
And this famous article from
1958 from High Fidelity,

00:30:55.890 --> 00:30:57.190
Babbitt sort of arguing, well,

00:30:57.190 --> 00:31:00.500
if you really can't take the
time to understand this music,

00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:04.670
then you shouldn't be
listening to it and, you know,

00:31:04.670 --> 00:31:08.660
we have to sort of retreat in
a way into the ivory tower.

00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:14.800
And so later on, he--
his own preferred title

00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:17.300
for this essay was "The
Composer as Specialist"

00:31:17.300 --> 00:31:20.760
and in his collected writings,
that's how it appears.

00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:23.590
So what he says is,
Babbitt, "I dare suggest

00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:25.020
that the composer
would do himself

00:31:25.020 --> 00:31:28.980
and his music an immediate
and eventual service by total,

00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:30.630
resolute, and voluntary
withdrawal

00:31:30.630 --> 00:31:33.080
from this public world to
one of private performance

00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:35.790
and electronic media, with
its very real possibility

00:31:35.790 --> 00:31:38.460
of complete elimination of
the public and social aspects

00:31:38.460 --> 00:31:40.780
of musical composition.

00:31:40.780 --> 00:31:42.080
Very radical.

00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:43.380
By so doing, the separation

00:31:43.380 --> 00:31:45.730
between the domains would be
defined beyond any possibility

00:31:45.730 --> 00:31:48.620
of confusion of categories,
and the composer would be free

00:31:48.620 --> 00:31:51.320
to pursue a private life of
professional achievement,

00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:52.620
as opposed to a public life

00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:55.480
of unprofessional
compromise and exhibitionism.

00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:57.470
The various institutes
of advanced research

00:31:57.470 --> 00:31:58.770
and the large majority

00:31:58.770 --> 00:32:01.650
of foundations had disregarded
contemporary music's need

00:32:01.650 --> 00:32:03.710
for the means of survival.

00:32:03.710 --> 00:32:06.180
Granting to music the
position accorded other arts

00:32:06.180 --> 00:32:09.580
and sciences promises the sole
substantial means of survival

00:32:09.580 --> 00:32:11.810
for the music I have
been describing.

00:32:11.810 --> 00:32:14.480
If this music is not supported,
the whistling repertory

00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:16.490
of the man in the street
will be little affected,

00:32:16.490 --> 00:32:18.910
the concert-going activity
of the conspicuous consumer

00:32:18.910 --> 00:32:21.540
of musical culture will
be little disturbed.

00:32:21.540 --> 00:32:24.570
But music will cease to
evolve, right because for him

00:32:24.570 --> 00:32:28.660
and for Schoenberg the idea
the music had to evolve, and,

00:32:28.660 --> 00:32:30.910
that important sense,
will cease to live."

00:32:30.910 --> 00:32:35.010
So again and, you know, to view
this sympathetically in a way,

00:32:35.010 --> 00:32:38.690
Babbitt is saying that, you
know, after all the humanities

00:32:38.690 --> 00:32:42.550
and the arts and science get
support whereas composers don't

00:32:42.550 --> 00:32:45.830
get that kind of foundation
or university support.

00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:48.070
And indeed, the university
is the only place

00:32:48.070 --> 00:32:51.590
and that's true today, basically
where a composer can have

00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:56.920
that kind of freedom
and level of, yeah,

00:32:56.920 --> 00:32:59.330
ability to do what he wants.

00:32:59.330 --> 00:33:02.100
So, a very-- and
this is certainly one

00:33:02.100 --> 00:33:04.950
of the most famous essays of
the later 20th century music,

00:33:04.950 --> 00:33:06.250
a very powerful statement

00:33:06.250 --> 00:33:08.740
that probably alienated
Babbitt even more

00:33:08.740 --> 00:33:11.580
from the public rather.

00:33:11.580 --> 00:33:15.440
But Babbitt-- So the
question is his music is--

00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:18.100
treats uses a serial method
not only in terms of pictures

00:33:18.100 --> 00:33:19.830
but in terms of other
dimensions.

00:33:19.830 --> 00:33:23.210
Sometimes dynamics,
rhythm, meter.

00:33:23.210 --> 00:33:27.470
So it's applying-- it sort of
goes beyond Schoenberg in a way.

00:33:27.470 --> 00:33:30.680
And Babbitt was asked,
can you hear this stuff?

00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:33.800
Can you hear-- Or
how dependent is it?

00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:35.740
Like Schoenberg is saying,
how dependently is it

00:33:35.740 --> 00:33:39.110
on being able to
hear these things?

00:33:39.110 --> 00:33:42.100
And here's his response
in an interview.

00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:43.760
You do need to hear it but--

00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:47.090
&gt;&gt; Milton Babbitt: I have to
learn to hear it [inaudible],

00:33:47.090 --> 00:33:49.820
you learn it informally
as well as formally.

00:33:49.820 --> 00:33:52.110
I'm not saying you take
ear-training courses,

00:33:52.110 --> 00:33:56.380
but when you grow into the
music, after all, all you have

00:33:56.380 --> 00:33:57.850
to hear are intervals,

00:33:57.850 --> 00:34:00.580
the fundamental building
blocks of any music.

00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:01.880
When Stravinsky-- you know,

00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:04.580
Stravinsky showed tremendous
insight in that respect.

00:34:04.580 --> 00:34:06.420
When somebody said, how
could you have deserted us?

00:34:06.420 --> 00:34:08.630
How could you become
such an infidel?

00:34:08.630 --> 00:34:09.970
Well, I shouldn't use that word.

00:34:09.970 --> 00:34:11.750
How could you have done this?

00:34:11.750 --> 00:34:13.560
How could you have deserted us

00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:16.610
and become a twelve-tone,
a serial composer?

00:34:16.610 --> 00:34:19.240
He said, but I've always
composed with intervals.

00:34:19.240 --> 00:34:22.050
And that was remarkable
because he recognized something

00:34:22.050 --> 00:34:24.230
that very few people, even
who regarded themselves

00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:26.910
as being quite friendly
to twelve-tone music.

00:34:26.910 --> 00:34:28.210
We're not talking about notes.

00:34:28.210 --> 00:34:29.510
We're not talking
about pitch classes.

00:34:29.510 --> 00:34:31.460
We're talking mainly about the
relationship between the two;

00:34:31.460 --> 00:34:34.510
that marvelous relation
called an interval

00:34:34.510 --> 00:34:36.820
which is unique almost
entirely to the perception

00:34:36.820 --> 00:34:38.950
of sound and nothing else.

00:34:38.950 --> 00:34:41.610
So he certainly used them

00:34:41.610 --> 00:34:46.450
in a particularly singular
and remarkable way.

00:34:46.450 --> 00:34:47.750
&gt;&gt; Walter Frisch:
Now he's talking

00:34:47.750 --> 00:34:49.650
about Stravinsky
there at the turn.

00:34:49.650 --> 00:34:51.620
And, you know, you
might say, OK, well,

00:34:51.620 --> 00:34:53.790
you can hear those intervals
but, you know, can the rest

00:34:53.790 --> 00:34:55.400
of us always hear
those intervals?

00:34:55.400 --> 00:34:57.850
You know that Babbitt can
with your amazing ear.

00:34:57.850 --> 00:35:00.250
So-- But you sort of
see where he is coming

00:35:00.250 --> 00:35:02.010
from in that position.

00:35:02.010 --> 00:35:05.350
And on the other hand,
Babbitt, you know,

00:35:05.350 --> 00:35:07.260
as you can already tell
maybe from that interview,

00:35:07.260 --> 00:35:09.750
he had sort of a
whimsical sense of humor

00:35:09.750 --> 00:35:11.210
and quite [inaudible]
personality.

00:35:11.210 --> 00:35:14.200
And most of the titles for
his works are puns in one way

00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:16.300
or another, Semi-Simple
Variations,

00:35:16.300 --> 00:35:19.930
All Set for jazz ensemble,
Sextets, Playing for time,

00:35:19.930 --> 00:35:24.310
About Time, It Takes Twelve
to Tango, Transfigured Notes,

00:35:24.310 --> 00:35:26.690
Joy of More Sextets
which we'll hear today,

00:35:26.690 --> 00:35:28.670
Whirled Series, get it?

00:35:28.670 --> 00:35:32.950
Play It Again, Sam, None But
the Lone Flute, Around the Horn.

00:35:32.950 --> 00:35:35.980
I saw one septet but
equal the other day too.

00:35:35.980 --> 00:35:39.100
So the very individual
titles that he gave

00:35:39.100 --> 00:35:43.030
to his pieces across his career.

00:35:43.030 --> 00:35:46.320
Now, what you'll hear
today is actually one

00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:49.530
of Babbitt's longest pieces,
almost was 25 minutes long.

00:35:49.530 --> 00:35:52.500
And it's not an easy listen
in a way, I will admit,

00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:53.950
having spent some time.

00:35:53.950 --> 00:35:57.070
It divides into two very
large sections but you might--

00:35:57.070 --> 00:35:59.560
and the way to tell when that's
happening is there's a big piano

00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:00.860
solo in the middle.

00:36:00.860 --> 00:36:02.830
It's for piano and violin
about 12 minutes in.

00:36:02.830 --> 00:36:05.860
You got a long piano solo
and then begins Part 2.

00:36:05.860 --> 00:36:09.680
And beyond that, there's
all this use of color,

00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:11.820
use of register,
use of dynamics,

00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:14.310
but not traditional sections,
not traditional melody

00:36:14.310 --> 00:36:15.760
and accompaniment by any means.

00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:20.090
So use of various means to
kind of move from one section

00:36:20.090 --> 00:36:24.160
to the other, but again not
in a way that sonata form

00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:25.460
or anything like that.

00:36:25.460 --> 00:36:27.050
What I would show here briefly,

00:36:27.050 --> 00:36:29.050
and I've cherry-picked
my examples, of course,

00:36:29.050 --> 00:36:32.310
but in a way what Babbitt
is doing is not so different

00:36:32.310 --> 00:36:36.270
or you can see it from a
tradition and I've chosen

00:36:36.270 --> 00:36:37.840
of works for say
violin and piano.

00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:44.800
So here's the third movement
of Brahms' third violin sonata.

00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:48.640
And obviously a total work

00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:51.270
but you can have some pretty
radical harmonic gestures

00:36:51.270 --> 00:36:52.750
and usual progressions along

00:36:52.750 --> 00:36:55.940
with the very restricted
motivic language that Brahms,

00:36:55.940 --> 00:36:59.590
like just a motive of two or
three notes that gets repeated

00:36:59.590 --> 00:37:03.400
and the melody sort of dissolves
into these little fragments

00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:07.510
that in many ways points
ahead to the 20th century.

00:37:07.510 --> 00:37:33.070
[ Music ]

00:37:33.070 --> 00:37:36.880
It's a very special musical
language that, you know,

00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:38.810
is part of the late 19th
century but it's really--

00:37:38.810 --> 00:37:41.340
and then, you know,
20 years later

00:37:41.340 --> 00:37:47.390
or so [inaudible] petty much
dissolves this traditional

00:37:47.390 --> 00:37:50.790
melody plus accompaniment into
a more of an explanations--

00:37:50.790 --> 00:37:54.560
exploration, sorry, of the
colors and the possibilities

00:37:54.560 --> 00:37:55.860
between violin and piano.

00:37:55.860 --> 00:37:57.910
Many different techniques used.

00:37:57.910 --> 00:38:01.640
So, this is 1910, this
is already 108 years ago.

00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:04.510
Can get to it here.

00:38:04.510 --> 00:38:30.250
[ Music ]

00:38:30.250 --> 00:38:34.860
And with Babbitt, I'll just
play a short excerpt of it.

00:38:34.860 --> 00:38:38.080
It's really-- If you view that
sort of evolutionary metaphor,

00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:42.090
really is part of this tradition
but a later manifestation

00:38:42.090 --> 00:38:44.980
of the evolution of exploring
these different sonorities,

00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:49.510
dialog, you might say exchanges
between violin and piano.

00:38:49.510 --> 00:39:54.230
[ Music ]

00:39:54.230 --> 00:39:56.450
Gestures are much more
extreme and fragmented,

00:39:56.450 --> 00:39:59.550
but really in some
ways, not that different

00:39:59.550 --> 00:40:03.540
from the [inaudible] from
75 years or however earlier.

00:40:03.540 --> 00:40:08.210
So, that's one way to
sort of listen for it.

00:40:08.210 --> 00:40:12.990
A few final remarks, Babbitt and
Schoenberg have this reputation,

00:40:12.990 --> 00:40:16.610
you know, as-- which they
partly cultivated as sort

00:40:16.610 --> 00:40:19.350
of these modernist writers,
a very difficult music.

00:40:19.350 --> 00:40:24.440
But both had a lot of interest
in-- or both had interest in

00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:26.540
and respect for popular music,

00:40:26.540 --> 00:40:28.920
popular music culture
of their time.

00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:34.530
And it comes out somewhat in
their music but also in the way

00:40:34.530 --> 00:40:37.400
in which they expressed
themselves about this music.

00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:40.360
And I want to-- Sorry.

00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:44.170
So I don't know how
many of you know

00:40:44.170 --> 00:40:47.620
that Stephen Sondheim
studied with Milton Babbitt.

00:40:47.620 --> 00:40:50.220
Here's a little bit from
a wonderful documentary

00:40:50.220 --> 00:40:53.070
which explains this
relationship in ways

00:40:53.070 --> 00:40:54.460
that I think are quite moving.

00:40:54.460 --> 00:40:57.780
&gt;&gt; Stephen Sondheim:
You changed my life.

00:40:57.780 --> 00:41:04.030
You taught me what
music is about.

00:41:04.030 --> 00:41:06.140
&gt;&gt; Milton Babbitt: Actually I
haven't the slightest idea why

00:41:06.140 --> 00:41:07.440
he came to me.

00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:08.740
I really don't.

00:41:08.740 --> 00:41:10.040
I mean I was hardly
a hustle [inaudible].

00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:11.340
This was 1952.

00:41:11.340 --> 00:41:13.360
He said it was '51,
[inaudible] 1952.

00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:15.640
I have no idea how he coming

00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:18.280
out of Williams College
whose closest associates

00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:21.180
in music were Oscar Hammerstein
and others [inaudible].

00:41:21.180 --> 00:41:24.440
Well, he came to study with
me and there was no question

00:41:24.440 --> 00:41:26.450
of coming to study musical
comedy or any of that,

00:41:26.450 --> 00:41:28.690
he didn't even know I had
the interest or any concern.

00:41:28.690 --> 00:41:31.030
He wanted to do script
counterpoint,

00:41:31.030 --> 00:41:32.630
species counterpoint, he want

00:41:32.630 --> 00:41:35.510
to do the implications
[inaudible] analysis.

00:41:35.510 --> 00:41:48.970
[ Music and Singing ]

00:41:48.970 --> 00:41:53.510
&gt;&gt; We met once week and we would
spend I'd say probably three

00:41:53.510 --> 00:41:54.810
to four hours together.

00:41:54.810 --> 00:42:01.510
And the first hour we
spent in analyzing songs.

00:42:01.510 --> 00:42:05.120
[ Music and Singing ]

00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:08.870
I taught at Oxford
about four years ago.

00:42:08.870 --> 00:42:12.860
And the class wanted a
little musical analysis

00:42:12.860 --> 00:42:15.180
and I gave Milton's analysis
of "All the Things You Are".

00:42:15.180 --> 00:42:17.510
It's not only accurate
but it's eye-opening.

00:42:17.510 --> 00:42:21.040
[ Music and Singing ]

00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:24.500
&gt;&gt; Milton Babbitt: Kern
was the profoundly most

00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:25.810
original songwriter.

00:42:25.810 --> 00:42:27.680
There were no two
songs really alike.

00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:30.830
And every sense of the word
his songs were crafted.

00:42:30.830 --> 00:42:34.340
&gt;&gt; Walter Frisch: You know,
that's where it cuts off.

00:42:34.340 --> 00:42:35.850
So he's talking about
Jerome Kern.

00:42:35.850 --> 00:42:41.480
Babbitt and Sondheim
and that song was

00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:42.780
"All the Things You Are".

00:42:42.780 --> 00:42:44.520
So he had great admiration.

00:42:44.520 --> 00:42:47.620
And in his early days,
Babbitt wrote show songs.

00:42:47.620 --> 00:42:49.780
I believe they are actually
here at the Library of Congress,

00:42:49.780 --> 00:42:53.070
some of the kind of
the pop songs he wrote.

00:42:53.070 --> 00:42:57.030
So again, this was
part of who he was

00:42:57.030 --> 00:42:58.660
and what he was interested in.

00:42:58.660 --> 00:43:05.320
And the same is true
for Arnold Schoenberg.

00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:07.140
Schoenberg, when he
lived in Los Angeles,

00:43:07.140 --> 00:43:10.010
became pretty good friends
with George Gershwin.

00:43:10.010 --> 00:43:12.090
And they played tennis together.

00:43:12.090 --> 00:43:13.390
They did other things.

00:43:13.390 --> 00:43:14.690
You see here a picture

00:43:14.690 --> 00:43:17.440
of Gershwin painting his
portrait of Arnold Schoenberg.

00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:19.300
And if you go across
the hall after,

00:43:19.300 --> 00:43:22.900
you can see the wonderful
Gershwin room over there.

00:43:22.900 --> 00:43:26.320
You can see some other paintings
that Gershwin did, self-portrait

00:43:26.320 --> 00:43:30.000
and then a wonderful portrait of
Jerome Kern, the composer that--

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:33.890
and here he is painting his
Arnold Schoenberg portrait.

00:43:33.890 --> 00:43:37.210
And for his part, Schoenberg
really admired Gershwin.

00:43:37.210 --> 00:43:41.420
When Gershwin died in 37,
I guess in Los Angeles,

00:43:41.420 --> 00:43:44.680
they asked a number of people
to make comments on the radio.

00:43:44.680 --> 00:43:48.350
Schoenberg has an essay also in
style and idea about Gershwin.

00:43:48.350 --> 00:43:50.960
And here's what Schoenberg
said about George Gershwin.

00:43:50.960 --> 00:43:54.710
I've transcribed it because
his accent is rather thick.

00:43:54.710 --> 00:43:56.530
&gt;&gt; Arnold Schoenberg:
George Gershwin was one

00:43:56.530 --> 00:44:01.050
of these rare kind of musicians
to whom music is not a matter

00:44:01.050 --> 00:44:04.400
of more or less ability.

00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:07.850
Music to him was
the air he breathed,

00:44:07.850 --> 00:44:13.980
the food which nourished him,
the drink that refreshed him.

00:44:13.980 --> 00:44:17.990
Music was what made him feel

00:44:17.990 --> 00:44:21.250
and music was the
feeling he expressed.

00:44:21.250 --> 00:44:25.480
Directness of this kind is
given only to great men.

00:44:25.480 --> 00:44:29.940
And there is no doubt that
he was a great composer.

00:44:29.940 --> 00:44:32.870
What he has achieved was
not only to the benefit

00:44:32.870 --> 00:44:36.210
of a national American music
but also a contribution

00:44:36.210 --> 00:44:38.730
to the music of the whole world.

00:44:38.730 --> 00:44:42.050
In this meaning I want to
express the deepest grief

00:44:42.050 --> 00:44:45.960
for the deplorable
loss to music.

00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:49.130
&gt;&gt; Walter Frisch: So Schoenberg
and Babbitt, high modernists

00:44:49.130 --> 00:44:51.080
who nonetheless had
great admiration

00:44:51.080 --> 00:44:52.560
for you might say soft spot

00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:56.840
for the great American
song tradition as well.

00:44:56.840 --> 00:45:02.040
So all in there and I'm happy to
take some question if you want.

00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:04.510
And thank you for listening.

00:45:04.510 --> 00:45:19.030
[ Applause ]

00:45:19.030 --> 00:45:23.090
&gt;&gt; Didn't Babbitt at one
time write on a commission

00:45:23.090 --> 00:45:24.800
for the [inaudible]
orchestra who said

00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:27.240
that they were not
able to play it?

00:45:27.240 --> 00:45:28.580
And there were some
consideration

00:45:28.580 --> 00:45:30.890
about they wanted
their money back?

00:45:30.890 --> 00:45:32.590
&gt;&gt; Walter Frisch: Yeah,
that piece, I forgot,

00:45:32.590 --> 00:45:35.950
"Transfigured Notes" yeah, yeah.

00:45:35.950 --> 00:45:37.610
&gt;&gt; What happened with that?

00:45:37.610 --> 00:45:39.580
&gt;&gt; Walter Frisch: I
guess did they-- yes.

00:45:39.580 --> 00:45:41.950
&gt;&gt; Record the [inaudible]
recorded it.

00:45:41.950 --> 00:45:43.710
&gt;&gt; Walter Frisch:
Of course he did.

00:45:43.710 --> 00:45:46.730
And in that documentary which
you can find on YouTube,

00:45:46.730 --> 00:45:48.730
there are some discussion
of that

00:45:48.730 --> 00:45:53.290
and it shows Babbitt sitting
at rehearsals for that piece,

00:45:53.290 --> 00:45:57.660
I think and-- or just after
and complaining that, you know,

00:45:57.660 --> 00:46:00.490
the conductor hadn't really
prepared or, you know,

00:46:00.490 --> 00:46:03.320
complaining that this piece
is not unplayable but people,

00:46:03.320 --> 00:46:05.840
you know, have to learn-- know
how to read notes and stuff

00:46:05.840 --> 00:46:07.230
like that, they read
this and some stuff.

00:46:07.230 --> 00:46:09.820
&gt;&gt; I was doing a
visiting composer series

00:46:09.820 --> 00:46:12.480
for Peabody Conservatory
when I was in school there

00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:14.930
and I had the opportunity
to spend some time

00:46:14.930 --> 00:46:18.090
with Milton Babbitt, and we
went out drinking and he had

00:46:18.090 --> 00:46:20.730
like the Rusty Nail, it
was a drink that he had

00:46:20.730 --> 00:46:23.470
and just given a talk in
seminar which went miles

00:46:23.470 --> 00:46:25.590
above everybody's head.

00:46:25.590 --> 00:46:28.420
And he had things on the board,
I remember, equations look

00:46:28.420 --> 00:46:29.720
like mathematical equations.

00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:32.110
I didn't have the slightest idea
so as we were talking he said--

00:46:32.110 --> 00:46:33.550
and we had a couple of
drinks, he said, well,

00:46:33.550 --> 00:46:34.850
what did you think of the talk?

00:46:34.850 --> 00:46:38.470
I said if you want to know
I had to tell you, it was--

00:46:38.470 --> 00:46:40.530
you could have been
double talking,

00:46:40.530 --> 00:46:43.200
to which he started laughing,
had a great laugh about that.

00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:45.090
The man just had
an incredible way

00:46:45.090 --> 00:46:46.530
of talking, but so brilliant.

00:46:46.530 --> 00:46:47.830
&gt;&gt; Walter Frisch:
Indeed, indeed.

00:46:47.830 --> 00:46:49.750
&gt;&gt; And the other thing with
Schoenberg, didn't he say once

00:46:49.750 --> 00:46:51.820
that he was not a slave
to the twelve-tone.

00:46:51.820 --> 00:46:54.420
If there was a note he wanted
instead of one in the row,

00:46:54.420 --> 00:46:56.330
he would just put it
in, he wouldn't feel--

00:46:56.330 --> 00:46:57.630
&gt;&gt; Walter Frisch: Yes.

00:46:57.630 --> 00:46:59.590
And more and more as his
career went on he did that.

00:46:59.590 --> 00:47:02.900
I mean, even already
in that Third Quartet,

00:47:02.900 --> 00:47:06.570
it's very flexible again because
it's not you read in textbooks

00:47:06.570 --> 00:47:08.150
or in, you know, Wikipedia
or whatever, you know,

00:47:08.150 --> 00:47:09.690
you're not supposed
to repeat any note

00:47:09.690 --> 00:47:13.960
until all 12 have sounded
but that's not the case.

00:47:13.960 --> 00:47:18.290
And then in the later
movements of the Third Quartet,

00:47:18.290 --> 00:47:19.940
he's combining them
harmonically.

00:47:19.940 --> 00:47:24.370
And so yeah, absolutely,
there's a lot of--

00:47:24.370 --> 00:47:27.810
yeah, it's a compositional
tool not a template at all.

00:47:27.810 --> 00:47:29.920
&gt;&gt; Because he has
feeling of being so rigid

00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:31.280
but he wasn't actually.

00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:32.840
&gt;&gt; Walter Frisch:
No, it was never.

00:47:32.840 --> 00:47:35.140
I don't think so, yeah.

00:47:44.300 --> 00:47:47.770
&gt;&gt; I thank-- Can you hear?

00:47:47.770 --> 00:47:49.070
&gt;&gt; Walter Frisch: Yes.

00:47:49.070 --> 00:47:50.370
&gt;&gt; OK, thanks.

00:47:50.370 --> 00:47:51.670
Thank you.

00:47:51.670 --> 00:47:52.970
I came in late so I
may be asking some

00:47:52.970 --> 00:47:54.270
about Schoenberg you covered.

00:47:54.270 --> 00:47:56.090
Thanks for making the
links between them

00:47:56.090 --> 00:47:59.490
and the pop song composers
I'd like to tell the story too

00:47:59.490 --> 00:48:01.510
which you probably know that,

00:48:01.510 --> 00:48:03.620
the College Quartet did
the first recordings

00:48:03.620 --> 00:48:04.920
of the Schoenberg Quartets--

00:48:04.920 --> 00:48:06.220
&gt;&gt; Walter Frisch: Yes.

00:48:06.220 --> 00:48:09.460
&gt;&gt; -- in the '30s and Gershwin
was one of the major financiers

00:48:09.460 --> 00:48:11.980
of those recordings, so
there was mutual admiration.

00:48:11.980 --> 00:48:14.940
&gt;&gt; Walter Frisch:
Absolutely, absolutely, yeah.

00:48:14.940 --> 00:48:19.300
&gt;&gt; And found a brief
interview excerpt with Babbitt

00:48:19.300 --> 00:48:21.660
on I was looking for it
last night, couldn't find it

00:48:21.660 --> 00:48:23.830
but where he really tells a
story of meeting Hindemith

00:48:23.830 --> 00:48:26.110
and it was kind of
an improbable meeting

00:48:26.110 --> 00:48:28.840
and probably the first words
out of Hindemith's mouth

00:48:28.840 --> 00:48:30.140
when he saw Babbitt was,

00:48:30.140 --> 00:48:32.510
you look like a twelve-tone
composer.

00:48:32.510 --> 00:48:36.760
[ Laughter ]

00:48:36.760 --> 00:48:41.440
And the documentary on
Babbitt really is wonderful.

00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:46.140
Big question maybe don't try to
go into deep detail but I'd be--

00:48:46.140 --> 00:48:48.470
what is your perspective
on sort of the--

00:48:48.470 --> 00:48:52.680
do you think the
twelve-tone or serial method

00:48:52.680 --> 00:48:56.370
or approaches has much
influence in today's music?

00:48:56.370 --> 00:48:59.710
Is it mainly in Europe and
not so much in United States?

00:48:59.710 --> 00:49:02.290
&gt;&gt; Walter Frisch: I think its
role has diminished and a lot--

00:49:02.290 --> 00:49:06.160
what composers are doing is a
lot different in many respects

00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:08.970
and not so much pitch-based
anymore but more, you know,

00:49:08.970 --> 00:49:13.060
timbre-based spectralist
and or rhythm, yeah,

00:49:13.060 --> 00:49:16.320
maybe some of the--
some European composers.

00:49:16.320 --> 00:49:19.740
But I think that-- you
know, and some people argue

00:49:19.740 --> 00:49:22.420
that the apparent supremacy

00:49:22.420 --> 00:49:24.980
of the twelve-tone method
was never really supremacy

00:49:24.980 --> 00:49:27.670
that all along, you know, there
were people doing other kinds

00:49:27.670 --> 00:49:29.390
of music, there were
Rachmaninov's

00:49:29.390 --> 00:49:33.740
and [inaudible] [inaudible] and,
you know, Samuel Barbers both

00:49:33.740 --> 00:49:37.820
in Europe and here and that
Benjamin Brittens and--

00:49:37.820 --> 00:49:40.560
but that in the post-- and with
probably because, you know,

00:49:40.560 --> 00:49:43.090
again, Babbitt wrote a lot
and was very influential

00:49:43.090 --> 00:49:46.600
in the Princeton School built
this up, some would say,

00:49:46.600 --> 00:49:50.640
then the German publication
[inaudible] built it up--

00:49:50.640 --> 00:49:58.190
that it was, you know, more
universal than it ever was even

00:49:58.190 --> 00:50:00.040
in the '30s, '40s, and '50s.

00:50:00.040 --> 00:50:02.830
But yeah, I would say it's
diminished now, I don't know.

00:50:02.830 --> 00:50:06.500
I admit that I don't follow
the contemporary music scene

00:50:06.500 --> 00:50:09.130
that much or at least the
part that I follow say based

00:50:09.130 --> 00:50:13.570
at Columbia or New York City,
that's really not part of it.

00:50:13.570 --> 00:50:21.310
I mean people study it, I think,
but they don't use it, but yeah.

00:50:21.310 --> 00:50:28.980
&gt;&gt; Well, according to respond to
your question a little indirect

00:50:28.980 --> 00:50:31.480
but we heard [inaudible]
same thing basically.

00:50:31.480 --> 00:50:35.090
Schoenberg once said that
he didn't want people

00:50:35.090 --> 00:50:36.890
to analyze his techniques.

00:50:36.890 --> 00:50:39.510
He wanted them to
whistle his melodies.

00:50:39.510 --> 00:50:40.890
&gt;&gt; Walter Frisch: Yes,
yes, that's a famous--

00:50:40.890 --> 00:50:44.910
&gt;&gt; Now that's challenging and
that gets to a Babbitt quote,

00:50:44.910 --> 00:50:47.220
Babbitt was almost
endlessly quotable.

00:50:47.220 --> 00:50:50.060
He said Schoenberg
found out how it feels

00:50:50.060 --> 00:50:52.540
to have history leave you ahead.

00:50:52.540 --> 00:50:58.890
&gt;&gt; Walter Frisch: That's
good, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:50:58.890 --> 00:51:01.310
Thank you very much, yeah.

00:51:06.050 --> 00:51:07.350
Yes.

00:51:07.350 --> 00:51:08.940
&gt;&gt; Two comments.

00:51:08.940 --> 00:51:14.490
The Babbitt, his feeling of
non-compromise took me back

00:51:14.490 --> 00:51:23.040
to memory of hearing in New
York City in the mid '70s.

00:51:23.040 --> 00:51:24.840
I think it was playing for time.

00:51:24.840 --> 00:51:27.290
I don't think it had
been published yet.

00:51:27.290 --> 00:51:30.480
And he was doing something
with the dance group,

00:51:30.480 --> 00:51:33.020
could have been [inaudible]
I'm not sure,

00:51:33.020 --> 00:51:37.870
but it was in a very small
room and it was like packed

00:51:37.870 --> 00:51:40.420
with people from stem to stern

00:51:40.420 --> 00:51:43.460
and a horseshoe and
then the group.

00:51:43.460 --> 00:51:47.350
And really-- And he was
there and it really was one

00:51:47.350 --> 00:51:51.650
of the most intense experiences
I have ever remembered.

00:51:51.650 --> 00:51:53.960
So I think there is
something about that.

00:51:53.960 --> 00:51:57.750
I think it's the intensity
that he didn't want

00:51:57.750 --> 00:52:00.980
to leak out by compromise.

00:52:00.980 --> 00:52:02.280
&gt;&gt; Walter Frisch: Yeah.

00:52:02.280 --> 00:52:03.580
I think that's-- yeah.

00:52:03.580 --> 00:52:08.900
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And the second one
is this thing about Stravinsky

00:52:08.900 --> 00:52:16.970
and his neoclassical the Third
Symphonies and the criticism

00:52:16.970 --> 00:52:21.550
that he wasn't being true to
Schoenberg and his method.

00:52:21.550 --> 00:52:25.370
And in actuality,
Stravinsky came back and said,

00:52:25.370 --> 00:52:29.520
I'm trying to follow
Schoenberg's method

00:52:29.520 --> 00:52:30.820
to the letter.

00:52:30.820 --> 00:52:33.900
And he was being
criticized for his lack

00:52:33.900 --> 00:52:37.140
of repetitive and freedom of it.

00:52:37.140 --> 00:52:43.620
So I'm wondering if perhaps he
needed Schoenberg to move away

00:52:43.620 --> 00:52:48.720
from some of the early roots of,
you know, the "dom, dom, dom,

00:52:48.720 --> 00:52:52.700
dom, dom", the repetitive
rhythmic style and--

00:52:52.700 --> 00:52:55.200
&gt;&gt; Walter Frisch: For Stravinsky
to move away from that, yeah.

00:52:55.200 --> 00:53:00.260
&gt;&gt; And to kind of free him
up into having a structure

00:53:00.260 --> 00:53:03.190
but freeing up the
rhythmic aspect of that.

00:53:03.190 --> 00:53:05.170
&gt;&gt; Walter Frisch: That's
an interesting theory.

00:53:05.170 --> 00:53:08.290
I mean I do think that-- I
mean Babbitt has a good point

00:53:08.290 --> 00:53:10.230
about Stravinsky or anybody.

00:53:10.230 --> 00:53:13.120
Aaron Copland, when he turned
into the twelve-tone method.

00:53:13.120 --> 00:53:15.050
They always sound like
themselves, Stravinsky,

00:53:15.050 --> 00:53:17.050
if you listen to
Agon, the ballet,

00:53:17.050 --> 00:53:19.960
it sounds like Stravinsky,
Copland's Nonet or some

00:53:19.960 --> 00:53:22.560
of the later works that
use twelve-tone method.

00:53:22.560 --> 00:53:25.470
They never sound-- which, you
know, again, sort of proves

00:53:25.470 --> 00:53:28.780
if you will that the twelve-tone
method is not a style

00:53:28.780 --> 00:53:31.560
or it's not-- you
know, it's a tool

00:53:31.560 --> 00:53:34.090
and Stravinsky will still
sound like Stravinsky.

00:53:34.090 --> 00:53:36.370
And you know, I mean I do
think those rhythmic aspects

00:53:36.370 --> 00:53:38.450
of Stravinsky may be not
as intense as in "The Rite

00:53:38.450 --> 00:53:41.750
of Spring" but he's
interested in rhythmic ostinati

00:53:41.750 --> 00:53:43.860
and shaping things with that.

00:53:43.860 --> 00:53:47.550
It's still there but
yeah, it can be modified

00:53:47.550 --> 00:53:49.990
with the twelve-tone system.

00:53:49.990 --> 00:53:52.250
I mean it supposedly,
famously, you know,

00:53:52.250 --> 00:53:55.250
he waited until Schoenberg
died until '51

00:53:55.250 --> 00:53:57.080
and then he started writing
serial music, you know,

00:53:57.080 --> 00:54:00.760
when they were both sort of, you
know, competitors if you will

00:54:00.760 --> 00:54:04.400
or at least rivals of some
sort in Los Angeles in the '30s

00:54:04.400 --> 00:54:08.260
and '40s and '50s or, you know,
up until Schoenberg's death

00:54:08.260 --> 00:54:10.380
and Stravinsky felt
more liberated

00:54:10.380 --> 00:54:13.020
to try the twelve-tone method.

00:54:13.020 --> 00:54:14.320
Yeah.

00:54:14.320 --> 00:54:17.050
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: I think--

00:54:17.050 --> 00:54:19.590
Sorry, I think we're
about out of time.

00:54:19.590 --> 00:54:22.870
So I just want to throw out
there that there is quite a lot

00:54:22.870 --> 00:54:25.760
of stylistic variety in serial
music that is definitely

00:54:25.760 --> 00:54:28.760
out there that I want you
to explore and consider

00:54:28.760 --> 00:54:32.950
as you consider in looking
at this type of music.

00:54:32.950 --> 00:54:36.540
But there's not just one
particular method that's

00:54:36.540 --> 00:54:38.930
followed, you know, to this day
and things like that, you know,

00:54:38.930 --> 00:54:40.330
it's often a misconception.

00:54:40.330 --> 00:54:41.800
&gt;&gt; Walter Frisch: Yeah,
anymore than pieces

00:54:41.800 --> 00:54:44.910
in E flat major sound is
different from each other,

00:54:44.910 --> 00:54:47.880
you know, as the
Eroica Symphony and--

00:54:47.880 --> 00:54:52.450
you know, thinking other E
flat, can't come up with it.

00:54:52.450 --> 00:54:54.060
But thank you.

00:54:54.060 --> 00:54:56.370
Anyway, yeah, so I think
that's a good point,

00:54:56.370 --> 00:54:58.510
it doesn't dictate a style.

00:54:58.510 --> 00:55:02.510
[ Inaudible ]

00:55:02.510 --> 00:55:07.300
[ Applause ]
