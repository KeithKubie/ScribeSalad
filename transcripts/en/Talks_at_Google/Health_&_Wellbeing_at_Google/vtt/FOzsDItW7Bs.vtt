[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.887 --> 00:00:06.470
TOM MYERS: Hi.

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:07.470
And thank you very much.

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.190
Very glad to be here at Google.

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:17.200
And the subject, really, today
is three different subjects,

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.620
and the first is movement.

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:20.147
You see nine people--

00:00:20.147 --> 00:00:21.980
I think there are seven
or nine people being

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.470
given the same
choreography in what you're

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:25.940
looking at on the screen now.

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:30.590
And yet they execute that
choreography all differently.

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:34.940
So I have been just
fascinated with human movement

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.000
for my entire life, partially,
because I'm such a bad mover.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.060
You know we all teach
what we need to learn.

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:44.960
And the way the
brain runs movement

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.630
has fascinated me
since I was very young.

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:52.430
And I submit that we
don't know very much

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.110
about that, number one.

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.860
And number two, the model
that we've been using for that

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.190
is getting badly
outdated rather quickly.

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.790
The idea that a muscle
attaches to a tendon that

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.460
goes across a joint that
is limited by the bone

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.340
shape and the ligaments
and, therefore, movement

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:15.500
comes about on a leverage
principle on Newton's laws.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.630
Einstein came 100 years ago.

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.250
We're just now bringing a
relativistic point of view

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.050
to body therapy.

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.440
And I really wanted to do this
today, particularly at Google,

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.660
because you guys are
really forward thinking

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:30.950
into the future.

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:32.510
And no matter--

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:34.400
I talked about your
digital obsession.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.420
And it's not just yours.

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.130
It's an entire generation's.

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:38.510
It's all of humanity.

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:40.400
I'm 70 years old or almost.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.490
And if you take my
phone away from me,

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.940
I begin to jones for
it after half an hour.

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.010
And I live my life on
email like everybody else.

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:53.900
But this happened so fast,
so fast to everybody.

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:54.400
Concerned.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.530
And it's an irreducible
fact that we have a body.

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.350
I came in on an airplane from
the West Coast yesterday.

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.850
And I was looking at
how much of the airplane

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.550
is taken up with the fact
that we are biological beings.

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:11.600
If we could only hold our
water for 10 or 12 hours, which

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.270
doesn't seem too much to
ask of a biological system,

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.830
we wouldn't have had to
have bathrooms on the plane.

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.400
If we could only hold our
breath for a few hours-- that

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.090
doesn't seem like too much to
ask of physiology-- but it is.

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.100
So we have to have
airplane that we carry

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.170
with us up to 33,000 feet.

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.870
And here you are,
working at Google,

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.490
and you irreducibly have a body.

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:40.280
For the first time in history,
we're looking at a world

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.660
that we create around
ourselves that doesn't

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.310
require us to move.

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.350
Now how does that
sentence finish?

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:55.780
That doesn't require us to
move enough to stay healthy,

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.260
enough to stay in a
really ideal state--

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.620
we don't know, because we've
never had a time in history

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.930
that's like this, never, ever.

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.035
And as you guys move
into the future,

00:03:08.035 --> 00:03:09.410
and we move into
driverless cars,

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.060
and we move into
more and more things

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.690
that our phones do
for us, with us,

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:17.570
then we have to
think about, hmm,

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:19.440
how do we educate kids to move?

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.840
So I'm going to spend
about 15 minutes on that.

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.880
And I'm going to spend about 15
minutes on fascia as a system

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.670
because the new way of
thinking about movement

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.677
is dependent on understanding
this new system.

00:03:31.677 --> 00:03:34.010
And then I'm going to spend
the last 15 minutes thinking

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:36.200
about what I particularly
did with that, which

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.350
is called the "Anatomy Trains"
of putting the muscles together

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:40.460
like strings of sausages.

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:43.945
So we're going to go one,
two, three on those things.

00:03:43.945 --> 00:03:46.070
You're not the only one
who are digitally obsessed.

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:48.170
Even us old people are
digitally obsessed.

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.220
So I promote through
the "Anatomy Trains"

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.050
an idea of structural
integration,

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:55.352
which is deep bodywork.

00:03:55.352 --> 00:03:56.810
Those of you coming
to the workshop

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:59.360
afterwards, we'll be
looking at how do we

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.950
interact with our hands into
the tissues of the body,

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:06.140
and how do they,
in fact, change?

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:10.100
But I am not an apologist for
only structural integration.

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:13.490
I am a great friend of yoga
and palates and weightlifting

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:15.980
and training and body
work of all kinds

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:20.480
because they all have value, and
we need them all in the world.

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:25.130
But we have to think
intelligently about what is KQ?

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:28.340
We're pretty good at IQ.

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:34.550
With the help of a lot of women
this week and Daniel Goleman,

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:39.140
we're beginning to learn about
EQ, emotional intelligence.

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:45.142
We haven't begun to map KQ,
the intelligence of the body.

00:04:45.142 --> 00:04:46.850
And I'm pointing to
the center of gravity

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:49.310
of the body, what's known
as that Dan Tian or Hara

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:50.480
in martial arts.

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:53.990
It is the center of your fibrous
body, the center of your moving

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:55.020
body.

00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:01.230
We don't know that the even
of kinesthesia and movement.

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:04.280
And we're going to need
to find out this century,

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:05.370
in particular.

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:07.130
Because this century,
in particular,

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:10.316
we're going to find out
how to change behavior.

00:05:10.316 --> 00:05:12.170
Hm.

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:15.810
Medicine is really good
at changing chemistry.

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:17.310
Psychiatry was
supposed to be really

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:18.393
good at changing behavior.

00:05:18.393 --> 00:05:21.570
You can have your own opinions
about how they're doing

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:23.740
with that particular task.

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:26.580
But we work with movement.

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:30.460
And therefore, we are very
close to changing behavior.

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:34.020
So the massage therapists, the
trainers, the body workers,

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.570
the movement teachers,
the physical education

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:38.730
teachers of this
world right now are

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:42.240
going to have to
figure out, what is KQ?

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:46.320
And how do we have, at least,
a minimum program of KQ

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:48.150
for our kids?

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:50.100
Look at what has happened to us.

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:51.670
Are humans natural?

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:54.420
And I can go on for half an
hour just on that subject,

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:55.290
but I'm going to.

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:56.748
I'm going to suggest
that there are

00:05:56.748 --> 00:05:59.940
five things that have really
taken us away from nature.

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:03.210
And one of them was standing up.

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:08.370
That happened way back in paleo
times, not 200,000 years ago,

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:10.960
200,000 generations ago.

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:14.130
So our DNA has had
200,000 generations

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:17.850
to get used to standing
up, which takes us away

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:18.915
from our noses.

00:06:18.915 --> 00:06:20.896
So out noses become
less important.

00:06:20.896 --> 00:06:22.770
Our eyes move around to
the front of our head

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:24.870
because we were arboreal apes.

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:27.720
We stood up, and
that distinguished us

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:29.790
from natural animals.

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:32.087
Again, natural is a
really hard concept.

00:06:32.087 --> 00:06:34.170
We could play with that
concept for quite a while.

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:38.014
But just go with me with this.

00:06:38.014 --> 00:06:39.930
One of the things that
we did when we stood up

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:43.200
was put all our soft
sensitive bits right up

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:45.240
in the front of the body.

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:51.150
No other animal is so stupid as
to put the groin, the genitals,

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:53.880
the belly, and the breath
and the throat right up front

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:58.730
and go into the world
with those things first.

00:06:58.730 --> 00:06:59.640
Umph.

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:03.510
This is the most
postural problem

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:05.910
that you will see across
the world is that we

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:07.560
shorten the front of our body.

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:10.350
And I've been enough all
over the world to say this

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:11.310
with some confidence.

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:12.870
We shorten the body
along the front

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:17.000
to protect our soft underbelly.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.800
And so you see these
kinds of patterns.

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:22.490
Or you're working at your desk
out of these kinds of patterns.

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:24.684
And your breath is not
supporting your body,

00:07:24.684 --> 00:07:26.600
your ribcage is not
supporting your shoulders,

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.280
therefore, your neck hurts,
duh-da, duh-da, duh-da.

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:29.840
It goes into the production.

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:32.420
You cannot get away from the
fact that you have a body,

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:33.700
and you're working with it.

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:38.550
Anyway, we stand up on our feet,
unlike any other animal, 16,

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:39.290
18 hours a day.

00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:45.980
Only 30,000 generations
ago, we tamed fire.

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:48.590
We don't know any other
animal that tamed fire.

00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:51.620
That really took us
away from the rest

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:54.380
of the animals, divided us
from the rest of the animals

00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:55.594
in a serious way.

00:07:55.594 --> 00:07:57.260
I've got about an
hour on each of these,

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.280
but I don't know who do that.

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:01.220
But you understand
that, once we controlled

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:02.840
fire, which is way back--

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:04.760
paleo people are
talking about going back

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:06.920
20,000 years or 30,000 years.

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:11.390
600,000 years ago, we start
finding ashes regularly

00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:14.630
in the archaeology
of human habitation.

00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:19.460
And agriculture, which we
depend on for the food that

00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:23.030
is out there at the food
stand outside this hall,

00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:27.320
we depend on agriculture, which
only came in 12,000 years ago

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:29.360
or 600 generations ago.

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:31.910
Your DNA has gotten
600 generations

00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:38.960
to get used to farm work
and cultivated food.

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:42.200
But then we went another
step, and we moved away

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:45.890
from the natural environment,
our regular contact

00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:49.070
with the natural environment,
which really is only

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:51.410
over the last 20
generations or so, we

00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:56.760
started making things-- that
chairs that you're sitting on.

00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:59.630
So now we live in
an environment that

00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:03.110
is an industrial environment.

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:05.780
We make so many things.

00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:08.240
And everything that you've
learned about the body

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:10.010
comes out of an industrial era.

00:09:10.010 --> 00:09:11.929
So if I say, what's
the heart like?

00:09:11.929 --> 00:09:13.470
What are you going
to say right away?

00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:15.260
It's a pun.

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.154
Lungs are a bellows,
the brain is a computer,

00:09:17.154 --> 00:09:18.570
the brain turns
out to be whatever

00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:21.110
is the most complicated
thing going on at the time--

00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:22.490
we call it the brain.

00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:24.650
When I was young, it
was a telephone system.

00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:27.560
When my grandfather was young,
it was the telegraph system.

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:30.002
When Descartes was
here, the newest thing

00:09:30.002 --> 00:09:31.460
was those little
pneumatic machines

00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:33.668
like you have at the bank
that sucks your cheque over

00:09:33.668 --> 00:09:34.790
to the teller.

00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:37.130
So he thought-- you put
your finger near a fire,

00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:40.310
and a little message went up
a pneumatic thing like that.

00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:42.200
Because that was the
most complicated machine

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:42.700
of the time.

00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:45.170
So now it's a dual
processor, I don't

00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:48.440
know what laser, quantum--
you guys would know more

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:49.460
about this than I do.

00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:51.085
But whatever it is,
we're going to say,

00:09:51.085 --> 00:09:53.260
oh, the brain is like
that because the brain

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:55.910
is the most complicated
thing that we know of other

00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:59.630
than the whole human universe.

00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:02.660
No system-- because I'm not
going to talk about the brain

00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:03.170
very much.

00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:05.090
No system has been
more mechanized

00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:06.710
than your
musculoskeletal system.

00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:08.064
It is a machine.

00:10:08.064 --> 00:10:09.230
We think of it as a machine.

00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:13.380
Your training regimen is to
do things to your machine.

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:16.972
But in the last two generations,
we have done the last step.

00:10:16.972 --> 00:10:18.930
Well, I don't know if
it's the last in history,

00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:24.110
but the latest for us, is
stepping into a global brain,

00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:26.750
stepping into something else.

00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:29.480
So the body has to
become something else.

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:33.080
I'm too old, and it's not quite
far enough into this revolution

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:35.360
to say what the body
will become or what

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:37.730
kind of physical
education that we need.

00:10:37.730 --> 00:10:40.670
But it's probably
not preparation

00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:43.190
for agricultural work.

00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:46.940
Only 3% of the population
is on the farms anymore.

00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:51.205
And it's not even preparation
for industrial work,

00:10:51.205 --> 00:10:52.580
which, as you may
have noticed is

00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:57.080
going south NAFTA or no NAFTA,
just going south in the world

00:10:57.080 --> 00:11:01.320
because robots can do anything
repetitive better than humans.

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:03.800
So the one thing-- because
I'm [INAUDIBLE] this thing

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:07.670
to get it down to 15
minutes, which is we

00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:11.630
need to teach our kids
to do original movement.

00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:14.850
Repetitive movement is
no longer what we need.

00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:19.310
Because we don't need people
on the lines with scythes going

00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:21.060
cross cutting the field.

00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:24.680
We don't need people on an
assembly line turning nuts.

00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:26.510
We need people to
do original stuff.

00:11:26.510 --> 00:11:29.730
So that means our physical
training has to change,

00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:35.730
not so much jumping jacks and
pushups and stuff anymore.

00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:39.500
So we look at spatial
medicine, and we

00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:41.884
see that this is the model
of what I was talking about.

00:11:41.884 --> 00:11:43.550
A muscle goes across
a joint, and that's

00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:45.710
how it works on the body.

00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:48.650
I would suggest
instead that we have

00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:52.100
to look at what our
kids are going to need

00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:54.500
in terms of movement hygiene.

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:55.940
Movement is food.

00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:57.180
Movement is medicine.

00:11:57.180 --> 00:11:59.090
What do we need in
terms of movement?

00:11:59.090 --> 00:12:00.590
You're sitting
there in your chair.

00:12:00.590 --> 00:12:04.640
Civilization has
made chairs something

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:05.750
that we use very much.

00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:08.340
So get off the
back of your chair.

00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:11.450
And if you're listening to
this, you can do the same thing.

00:12:11.450 --> 00:12:13.820
Get off the back of your
chair and onto the sits bones

00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:15.995
at the bottom of your pelvis.

00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:21.710
And if you rock your pelvis
forward and back a little bit,

00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:24.230
you'll feel that you're
going towards your tailbone

00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:28.580
and then towards your pubic
bone on these sits bones.

00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:30.950
And that, in
somewhere in that arc,

00:12:30.950 --> 00:12:34.940
your low back feels
the most comfy.

00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:37.190
That, if you really go
onto your pubic bone,

00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:39.950
your low back will
feel arched and tight.

00:12:39.950 --> 00:12:42.800
And that, if you really go
back onto your tailbone,

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:45.170
your chest will fall, and
your breathing will suffer.

00:12:45.170 --> 00:12:46.460
Is that fair?

00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:50.060
And where is the middle?

00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:50.570
That's fine.

00:12:50.570 --> 00:12:52.010
We can spend an
hour on this too.

00:12:52.010 --> 00:12:56.960
But my question for you is,
did anybody coming into Google

00:12:56.960 --> 00:13:00.350
or coming into your school life
teach you how to use a chair?

00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:01.040
No.

00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:03.530
You just fell into
the use of a chair.

00:13:03.530 --> 00:13:06.340
We have to actually
now teach kids

00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:07.840
to use a chair
because they're going

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:10.040
to use a chair for
so much of their life

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:14.850
on airplanes, in
cars, and at work.

00:13:14.850 --> 00:13:17.180
How many of you are
now saying, how long

00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:19.040
is he going to have
us like this, right?

00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:21.350
Because certain muscles
need to get stronger.

00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:24.410
Certain muscles maybe need to
relax a little bit for this

00:13:24.410 --> 00:13:26.420
to be an easy place for you.

00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:29.390
But if you let your hands
float up to your keyboard

00:13:29.390 --> 00:13:31.310
or to whatever you
interface with-- just

00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:32.684
let your hands
float up to you're

00:13:32.684 --> 00:13:34.340
comfortable position
of interface.

00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:36.890
Hold those hands there imagining
that you're on a keyboard

00:13:36.890 --> 00:13:41.750
or whatever, and drop back
into the behind your sits bones

00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:43.800
and feel what happens
to your shoulders.

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:45.110
Your shoulders lose support.

00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:47.960
You are now using the muscles
of your shoulders and arms

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:49.910
and neck in a
different way in order

00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:55.280
to get the hands out there to
interface with your keyboard.

00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:57.530
And we could spend a
long time, but I'm not

00:13:57.530 --> 00:14:00.350
going to on the distance
between your screen

00:14:00.350 --> 00:14:03.320
and your eye which fixes a whole
bunch of stuff in your neck.

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:05.660
But that's a little
more obscure.

00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:11.030
So part one is, never before
in history have we needed this,

00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:12.810
but now we need movement.

00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:15.519
They went to Ethiopia
and took a tribe--

00:14:15.519 --> 00:14:17.810
I've forgotten the name of
the tribe-- on the Omo River

00:14:17.810 --> 00:14:20.240
and put Fitbits on them.

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:23.745
They mostly take
15,000 steps a day.

00:14:23.745 --> 00:14:25.370
I don't know if you've
got a Fitbit on.

00:14:25.370 --> 00:14:28.520
I hate them, personally,
but can't you

00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:29.840
feel inside your body?

00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:32.660
Do you need a machine to tell
you what your body is doing?

00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:34.970
Argh.

00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:39.830
But these guys we're doing,
and women we're doing,

00:14:39.830 --> 00:14:41.810
15,000 steps a day on average.

00:14:41.810 --> 00:14:45.170
And really, it's hard to
get up to 12,000 steps a day

00:14:45.170 --> 00:14:47.840
in a working environment.

00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:50.060
So they were much more
active than we were.

00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:52.250
So what's the minimum
amount of activity

00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:54.650
necessary for
health, mental health

00:14:54.650 --> 00:14:57.080
as well as physical health,
for your brain to work?

00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:59.190
Your body doesn't stop here.

00:14:59.190 --> 00:15:01.260
This is a hydrodynamic system.

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:03.000
It needs water to get to it.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.030
Exercise from below
helps you above.

00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:09.990
[LATIN]

00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:13.290
So you really
ought to understand

00:15:13.290 --> 00:15:18.300
if we take the fact that we need
to educate our children in how

00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:22.470
they move, then you
could have a look

00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:26.670
here at a dissection
of the fascial system.

00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:30.360
This is a dissection
of an untreated cadaver

00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:33.790
by Andres Pilat in Spain.

00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:36.741
And that's why you get the
flamenco dancer every once

00:15:36.741 --> 00:15:37.240
in a while.

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:39.960
But he's showing
you what it really

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:42.540
looks like under the skin.

00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:47.010
And we have had
an altered picture

00:15:47.010 --> 00:15:50.580
of what it's like under the
skin by looking in the books.

00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:53.910
Whatever anatomy you learned
in the books, that's great.

00:15:53.910 --> 00:15:56.880
But there's a whole
system of stuff.

00:15:56.880 --> 00:16:00.630
And it really is stuff
around the muscles

00:16:00.630 --> 00:16:03.270
like the skeleton of an orange.

00:16:03.270 --> 00:16:06.720
And it's that part that we're
going to be looking at here.

00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:08.400
Now, if you were
all therapists, I

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:11.220
would be starting to talk to
you about how you would affect

00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:14.100
the very deepest
level, the endomysium

00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:16.230
that you can see looking
like a honeycomb there.

00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:19.110
That honeycomb is
around each muscle cell.

00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:21.420
And then you see around the
bunches of muscle cells,

00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:23.070
in the middle
picture, you can see

00:16:23.070 --> 00:16:25.350
the perimysium, which
is the lubricating

00:16:25.350 --> 00:16:27.240
fascia inside the muscle.

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:29.130
And then on the
outside, the kind

00:16:29.130 --> 00:16:31.620
of ribbon candy that you
see down in the lower right

00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:34.860
is the epimysium, which is the
Saran wrap, the plastic wrap

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:37.170
that goes around all
the muscles, which

00:16:37.170 --> 00:16:40.410
will go into the tendon of
that vastus lateralis when

00:16:40.410 --> 00:16:42.810
it gets down to the bottom.

00:16:42.810 --> 00:16:45.180
So we could parse
out this thing.

00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:52.230
But the fascial system is
a great big unitary net

00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:53.640
that goes all over your body.

00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:55.300
It doesn't just
hold your muscles.

00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:58.290
There's fascia around the
bones, there's fascia around

00:16:58.290 --> 00:17:00.990
and in the cartilage, there's
fascia around your organs.

00:17:00.990 --> 00:17:03.920
Let's have a look
at it as a system.

00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:08.099
Here, coming from the
end of the 19th century,

00:17:08.099 --> 00:17:12.030
is a French surgeon's version
of seeing the fascial plains in

00:17:12.030 --> 00:17:14.170
between the muscles by
cutting the muscles back

00:17:14.170 --> 00:17:15.420
and leaving the fascial plane.

00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:18.240
So this was an early
way of looking at it,

00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:21.119
taking the muscles out of the
inner leg of the inner thigh

00:17:21.119 --> 00:17:25.050
and looking at the fascial
sheets that are left.

00:17:25.050 --> 00:17:28.470
You just don't have an anatomy
that really shows this.

00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:30.090
We're just beginning
to get them now.

00:17:30.090 --> 00:17:32.220
A few people are
beginning to publish them.

00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:37.632
But if I take a piece of the
thigh, which you see here,

00:17:37.632 --> 00:17:39.090
going down the
middle of the thigh,

00:17:39.090 --> 00:17:40.680
you see the femur in the middle.

00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:43.200
The skin and the fat have
been taken off the outside.

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:45.720
So you're seeing the
fascia profundus,

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:49.230
which is the fascia lata,
which is a thin sheet that

00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:52.320
goes around all the muscles
and squeezes in on them.

00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:55.890
What you haven't seen in
500 years of anatomy, what

00:17:55.890 --> 00:17:57.810
you haven't seen
is, what happens

00:17:57.810 --> 00:18:02.220
if we take the muscle out of
that and just leave the fascia?

00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:04.830
Now you see the
fascia as a system.

00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:09.900
You see the fiber of the body
as a wholly separate system

00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:11.130
that we have never seen.

00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:12.681
In 500 years of
anatomy, we do not

00:18:12.681 --> 00:18:13.930
have a picture of this system.

00:18:13.930 --> 00:18:17.610
This is the best I can do, and
it's only a piece of the thigh.

00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:22.590
There is work under way now in
the plastination lab in Germany

00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:24.810
to make some representations
of the system.

00:18:24.810 --> 00:18:30.990
But it is a really fairly much
a Cinderella of the body systems

00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:33.150
in that it has been
fairly much ignored,

00:18:33.150 --> 00:18:35.670
and we're working
with it, of course.

00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:38.010
Whatever you do with the
body, with your own body,

00:18:38.010 --> 00:18:39.300
you're working with
the fascial system.

00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:40.440
Whatever you do
with other bodies,

00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:42.065
you're working with
the fascial system.

00:18:42.065 --> 00:18:46.620
But could we do it better
if we did it consciously?

00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:48.660
So there's layers of fascia.

00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:49.740
Pick up your skin.

00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:52.670
Anywhere on your body,
just pick up your skin.

00:18:52.670 --> 00:18:54.600
You just picked up the
first layer of fascia.

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:58.950
That's this thin line that
the indicator line is pointing

00:18:58.950 --> 00:19:01.440
to next to the fat layer.

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:03.390
That's the superficial
or adipose layer,

00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:07.680
which is what allows your
skin to move around on top

00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:09.000
of the rest of your body.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:13.440
Then you have the unitard that
really holds you in the shape

00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:15.510
that you're in
underneath the skin.

00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:18.630
And then Saran wrap
around, a plastic wrap

00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:22.110
around each of the muscles,
intramuscular septa,

00:19:22.110 --> 00:19:24.240
like the divisions
between the orange,

00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:26.730
between superficial
muscles and deep muscles,

00:19:26.730 --> 00:19:31.140
and then the periosteum
around the bone there.

00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:33.300
Each of those layers
are different layers.

00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:37.020
But if we went back to
this, we would see it

00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:39.510
as a single system.

00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:42.480
It's useful to put it
in layers, but that

00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:44.430
is a human distinction.

00:19:44.430 --> 00:19:47.850
Almost anything, like
the iliotibial tract,

00:19:47.850 --> 00:19:51.090
or your ankle ligaments,
or your diaphragm--

00:19:51.090 --> 00:19:56.310
these are names that we have put
on something which is unitary.

00:19:56.310 --> 00:20:00.200
So what you want in
those fascial layers

00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:03.170
is that they slide and
glide easily on each other.

00:20:03.170 --> 00:20:05.630
And that's what allows
you full range of movement

00:20:05.630 --> 00:20:09.170
and easy coordination of your
movement for whatever motion

00:20:09.170 --> 00:20:10.530
you're going to do.

00:20:10.530 --> 00:20:15.990
The trouble is, when it
becomes dry or overused--

00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:19.520
so it dries out; it
loses its fluidity.

00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:22.520
Or it gets overused, which
makes inflammation, which

00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:25.981
means it loses its
fluidity, or inflammation

00:20:25.981 --> 00:20:27.980
from other reasons, like
you're eating something

00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:28.896
that you shouldn't be.

00:20:28.896 --> 00:20:31.860
Any of those things can make
this fascia stick together.

00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:38.390
So do you see the adhesions here
from the skin to the muscle?

00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:40.864
And you don't see those
fascial adhesions here.

00:20:40.864 --> 00:20:42.530
Or they're are so
small that they're not

00:20:42.530 --> 00:20:45.080
going to interfere with
the movement at all.

00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:47.300
But we really do
see these adhesions

00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:51.845
when we do dissections
so that you can see them.

00:20:51.845 --> 00:20:53.720
But you wouldn't see
them in an anatomy book,

00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:55.400
because that's the
stuff that's taken

00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:57.775
away so that you can see the
muscles in the anatomy book.

00:20:57.775 --> 00:20:59.600
So you're not seeing
the thing that's

00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:02.180
actually restricting movement.

00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:05.570
We do run dissections
on untreated cadavers

00:21:05.570 --> 00:21:08.240
where we are looking for
those kinds of things

00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:11.540
and trying to document that
so that people can see it.

00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:13.550
But those of you who
learned your anatomy

00:21:13.550 --> 00:21:18.560
from books, which is where
I learned my anatomy first,

00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:24.020
you get, not a false picture,
but a massaged picture

00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:26.570
of what's going on
inside the body.

00:21:26.570 --> 00:21:30.440
Come see for yourself is the
meaning of the word autopsy.

00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:36.530
And so if you look at the
fascial system, the things

00:21:36.530 --> 00:21:38.420
that you could
take away from it--

00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:40.970
I would say it's alive,
but I put that separately

00:21:40.970 --> 00:21:43.400
because that's an opinion.

00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:46.952
It is made by cells.

00:21:46.952 --> 00:21:49.160
Your fascial system-- and
we're going to go into that

00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:49.850
in a minute--

00:21:49.850 --> 00:21:51.710
is made by cells.

00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:54.350
But the things that I would
like you to take away,

00:21:54.350 --> 00:22:00.830
whether it's alive or dead, is
it's unitary from top to toe.

00:22:00.830 --> 00:22:03.800
You can cut it with
a surgeon's scalpel.

00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:07.430
It starts at day 15 of
your embryological life.

00:22:07.430 --> 00:22:10.010
Looking like the gel
that's around frog eggs--

00:22:10.010 --> 00:22:11.810
have you ever seen
frog eggs in a pond?

00:22:11.810 --> 00:22:13.940
Or is that too far
removed from Cambridge?

00:22:13.940 --> 00:22:18.082
Come on, go out to Walden
Pond, find the frog eggs,

00:22:18.082 --> 00:22:19.040
and you'll see the gel.

00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:21.350
And that's what starts
your facial system is

00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:24.440
a gel around the cells
in the very early embryo.

00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:25.880
And it stays unitary.

00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:29.040
So you can talk about all
these different things,

00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:30.500
of this ligament
and that tendon,

00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:31.950
but they're not separate.

00:22:31.950 --> 00:22:35.610
They're part of a unitary
system from top to toe.

00:22:35.610 --> 00:22:37.850
So it can get cut
with a scalpel.

00:22:37.850 --> 00:22:39.650
It can get torn in injury.

00:22:39.650 --> 00:22:40.850
It will fray with age.

00:22:40.850 --> 00:22:43.070
That's what's making the
lines around my eyes.

00:22:43.070 --> 00:22:48.090
But it is unitary from top
to toe and birth to death.

00:22:48.090 --> 00:22:52.070
And it transmits and
accommodates the forces,

00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:57.020
not in a way of just the
tendons going from bone to bone,

00:22:57.020 --> 00:23:01.850
but a whole system of a cobweb,
a three-dimensional cobweb,

00:23:01.850 --> 00:23:07.100
pulling in on a bone
system that's pushing out.

00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:09.780
We'll also talk-- we'll
talk a little more later,

00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:13.710
but we'll talk about how
it responds and transmit.

00:23:13.710 --> 00:23:17.330
But if you have this idea that
the skeletal system is pushing

00:23:17.330 --> 00:23:21.200
out and the myofascial
system, meaning

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:24.590
the muscle and the fascia
together, the white stuff

00:23:24.590 --> 00:23:27.530
and the red stuff,
are pulling in,

00:23:27.530 --> 00:23:29.630
that yin and yang,
the pulling in

00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:32.390
of the soft tissue and the
pushing out of the bones,

00:23:32.390 --> 00:23:34.220
is the balance
which ends up being

00:23:34.220 --> 00:23:39.350
our posture, our movement,
our posture in action,

00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:41.120
the recognizable
pattern of movement

00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:43.010
that we have
throughout our life.

00:23:43.010 --> 00:23:45.410
So you can change
that by training,

00:23:45.410 --> 00:23:47.210
or you can change
that by changing

00:23:47.210 --> 00:23:50.880
the fascial stuff itself.

00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:53.660
And finally, the last
two bits is that most

00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:55.340
of your body sensing--

00:23:55.340 --> 00:23:58.480
you say, I'm going to stretch
my muscles with some yoga.

00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:02.250
Your feeling your fascia six
times more than your muscles.

00:24:02.250 --> 00:24:05.060
You have six times more
endings in your fascia

00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:08.280
than you do in your
muscles on average.

00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:11.300
So you're really feeling this
system as you stretch it,

00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:13.460
and it's telling
you what's going on.

00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:16.910
And finally, all injuries-- if
you're working especially with

00:24:16.910 --> 00:24:18.020
a chronic injury--

00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:19.490
has a fascial component to it.

00:24:19.490 --> 00:24:23.270
So it's worthwhile
learning about this.

00:24:23.270 --> 00:24:26.750
Now, because it's Google,
I really want to do this.

00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:29.240
I want to present you
with a design problem.

00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:33.080
All life on the planet
started as single-celled life.

00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:35.240
And they did lots of
things like grew bristles

00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:36.560
which were sensitive.

00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:39.034
They managed to move
through the environment.

00:24:39.034 --> 00:24:40.700
They did all kinds
of interesting things

00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:43.690
as single cells, as
cyanotic bacteria, E. coli,

00:24:43.690 --> 00:24:48.080
the whole thing from
prokaryotic to eukaryotic cells.

00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:51.500
But then the eukaryotic cells
started getting together

00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:54.270
and making organisms.

00:24:54.270 --> 00:24:56.150
Now, when you make a
whole bunch of cells

00:24:56.150 --> 00:24:59.440
together in an organism,
each cell has to still live,

00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:02.270
has to get food delivered and
have its garbage taken away, et

00:25:02.270 --> 00:25:03.070
cetera.

00:25:03.070 --> 00:25:05.290
So you develop systems.

00:25:05.290 --> 00:25:07.600
And when you have
70 trillion cells--

00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:10.030
that's about the best estimate
that we have right now.

00:25:10.030 --> 00:25:12.760
If you included the cell
inside between your mouth

00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:15.460
and your anus, would probably
be more like 100 trillion,

00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:17.740
but in any case, this
is just a guesstimate

00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:20.390
because we don't really know
how many cells there are.

00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:22.870
But how are you
going to keep them

00:25:22.870 --> 00:25:25.364
in the proper relationship?

00:25:25.364 --> 00:25:27.280
You can't wake up tomorrow
and have your heart

00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:28.990
down in your left hip, right?

00:25:28.990 --> 00:25:30.860
It has to stay in place.

00:25:30.860 --> 00:25:35.314
So how did we get all these
cells to stay in place?

00:25:35.314 --> 00:25:37.480
Well, when you think about
the problem a little bit,

00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:39.760
you're either going to
have to glue them together,

00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:41.920
or you're going to have
to weave them together.

00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:45.940
And the answer for evolution
or Darwin or your mom or god

00:25:45.940 --> 00:25:49.900
or whoever you think does these
things, the answer was both.

00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:53.890
Your cells, which are very
delicate little fatty droplets

00:25:53.890 --> 00:26:00.370
of proteinous activity
wandering around in your body,

00:26:00.370 --> 00:26:03.940
have to be both woven
and glued into the system

00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:06.040
to either stay
where they are or be

00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:09.380
allowed to move in the way
that is appropriate to them.

00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:12.340
So the extracellular
matrix, the stuff

00:26:12.340 --> 00:26:15.940
that's around the cells in the
picture that you see there,

00:26:15.940 --> 00:26:18.501
is a combination
of woven fabric--

00:26:18.501 --> 00:26:20.500
which, if you know anything
about fascia at all,

00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:23.210
that's probably what you
know-- is they discovered these

00:26:23.210 --> 00:26:24.250
collagen--

00:26:24.250 --> 00:26:27.880
the cells discovered making
collagen fibers among others.

00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:32.950
And those collagen fibers are to
us what cellulose is to plants.

00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:34.540
It's what holds us together.

00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:40.390
But we're also glued together
with mucopolysaccharides,

00:26:40.390 --> 00:26:42.190
other words, mucus.

00:26:42.190 --> 00:26:45.504
So I caught a cold on the
plane yesterday coming back.

00:26:45.504 --> 00:26:47.170
I'm sorry that I have
a cold here today.

00:26:47.170 --> 00:26:50.410
But it just makes a
point that my body

00:26:50.410 --> 00:26:52.420
is getting rid of
some of the stuff

00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:55.030
that it uses to
glue me together.

00:26:55.030 --> 00:26:57.040
You have mucus all
over your body.

00:26:57.040 --> 00:26:58.330
You couldn't live without it.

00:26:58.330 --> 00:27:00.700
Most cells are coated in it.

00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:05.980
It is the interface between
the woven fabric and the cells

00:27:05.980 --> 00:27:07.300
that we go through.

00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:09.880
And the condition of
that gel, the condition

00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:13.060
of the gel between the
fabric, between the cells

00:27:13.060 --> 00:27:15.760
is really, really
crucial to how you

00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:22.270
process water, how you process
your food, how you can move.

00:27:22.270 --> 00:27:23.860
The fabric is
great, but the gels

00:27:23.860 --> 00:27:26.890
are really fun to listen to.

00:27:26.890 --> 00:27:29.950
So your fascial system
is your meta-membrane.

00:27:29.950 --> 00:27:32.320
It is the thing that keeps--

00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:33.370
you think it's your skin.

00:27:33.370 --> 00:27:36.070
But the fashion is really what
is the interface between you

00:27:36.070 --> 00:27:37.210
and the outside world.

00:27:37.210 --> 00:27:40.510
The skin is the direct interface
with the dry world outside,

00:27:40.510 --> 00:27:44.770
but the fascia is what
keeps you in your shape.

00:27:44.770 --> 00:27:47.740
Quickly, we have really
four different kinds

00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:50.320
of cells that develop
out of the ovum.

00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:52.360
One of them is really
good at conduction,

00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:54.980
but boy are they delicate.

00:27:54.980 --> 00:27:57.700
Cut them, and they just
don't repair very well.

00:27:57.700 --> 00:27:59.740
Take away oxygen
for a few minutes,

00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:01.960
and your nervous system
is really impaired

00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:03.290
for the rest of your life.

00:28:03.290 --> 00:28:07.150
They're very delicate cells,
but boy did they conduct well.

00:28:07.150 --> 00:28:10.210
Muscle cells specialized
in contraction,

00:28:10.210 --> 00:28:13.510
connective tissue cells
make the materials

00:28:13.510 --> 00:28:15.280
that make for support.

00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:17.660
How do they make
those materials?

00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:22.090
They exude out-- oh, I have
to put the fourth one in.

00:28:22.090 --> 00:28:24.730
The epithelial ones are
the ones that do linings.

00:28:24.730 --> 00:28:25.660
They line your lungs.

00:28:25.660 --> 00:28:27.470
They line all your capillaries.

00:28:27.470 --> 00:28:28.480
They line your gut.

00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:31.900
Anywhere you need a lining,
you use epithelial cells.

00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:35.020
But connective tissue cells
make all these different kinds

00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:37.120
of things to hold
the cells together.

00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:38.800
When there was only
a few cells, great,

00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:40.870
you just make junctions
between the cells

00:28:40.870 --> 00:28:43.330
like this, ways of holding
the cells together.

00:28:43.330 --> 00:28:45.010
But as you get more
and more cells,

00:28:45.010 --> 00:28:46.750
you need something
to connect them.

00:28:46.750 --> 00:28:51.130
And it is the connective tissue
that makes, out of these three

00:28:51.130 --> 00:28:54.880
elements-- just fibers
and the glue that you see,

00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:58.510
the brushy-looking
molecules are the glue.

00:28:58.510 --> 00:29:02.740
And it looks like this in vivo.

00:29:02.740 --> 00:29:05.320
This is the only
film of living fascia

00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:07.900
that we have made by a
French surgeon, Jean-Claude

00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:08.830
Guimberteau.

00:29:08.830 --> 00:29:15.940
He put a micro camera
into his patients

00:29:15.940 --> 00:29:18.760
while he was doing tendon
transfer operations

00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:22.060
and got all of
these and many more.

00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:23.560
Look up "Strolling
under the skin"

00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:26.350
if you want to see more
of this kind of thing

00:29:26.350 --> 00:29:30.400
where you can see how
the fibers are in life.

00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:36.340
So we had been doing dissection
of dead connective tissue

00:29:36.340 --> 00:29:37.690
and gotten one impression of it.

00:29:37.690 --> 00:29:39.250
But when you look
at it living, you

00:29:39.250 --> 00:29:43.450
see what an adaptable,
three-dimensional spider

00:29:43.450 --> 00:29:47.410
web of connections is really
going on in your body.

00:29:47.410 --> 00:29:49.150
And it's changing
moment to moment

00:29:49.150 --> 00:29:53.260
as the muscles move
and the forces change.

00:29:53.260 --> 00:29:57.760
Fascia has properties that are
really important in training.

00:29:57.760 --> 00:30:01.320
I'm going to leave that
here except for one, which

00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:04.200
is the second one-- elasticity.

00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:13.870
Let's just have a look at it
as we also see this on stage.

00:30:13.870 --> 00:30:16.990
I'd like you to notice
just how much effort I

00:30:16.990 --> 00:30:19.880
am using to keep the
carabiner going up and down.

00:30:23.490 --> 00:30:26.330
I could do this all day.

00:30:26.330 --> 00:30:31.440
If I was doing this, how
long would it take me?

00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:35.840
So what we've discovered is
that the fascia is viscous,

00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:40.980
like you see on the screen, but
also elastic, as you see here.

00:30:40.980 --> 00:30:44.160
So it has viscoelastic
properties.

00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:47.420
And this elasticity means it
can store and give back, store

00:30:47.420 --> 00:30:50.100
and give back, store
and give back energy.

00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:54.620
And that's what the runners who
are using the forefoot running

00:30:54.620 --> 00:30:57.200
are storing and giving
back, storing, giving back

00:30:57.200 --> 00:31:00.830
so they're not hitting the wall
so soon because they're not

00:31:00.830 --> 00:31:04.730
using up the stores
of sugar in their body

00:31:04.730 --> 00:31:07.290
by doing concentric
contractions.

00:31:07.290 --> 00:31:10.730
If you look at my hand, I'm
doing an almost isometric

00:31:10.730 --> 00:31:12.470
contraction to keep
this thing going.

00:31:12.470 --> 00:31:14.930
I have to do a little
contraction to keep it going.

00:31:14.930 --> 00:31:16.880
If I just stop
contracting whatsoever,

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:18.280
it would stop going.

00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:20.420
But with just a little
bit of a contraction,

00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:25.670
I can keep myself moving
along if you understand.

00:31:25.670 --> 00:31:30.710
The kind of therapy that
massage people might use,

00:31:30.710 --> 00:31:33.200
certainly, the kind
that I teach depends

00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:36.560
on a third property
of the fascia, which

00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:39.380
is called plasticity.

00:31:39.380 --> 00:31:40.760
You've heard of neuroplasticity.

00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:42.480
But this is fascial plasticity.

00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:45.476
So if you watch, as
I stretch the fascia,

00:31:45.476 --> 00:31:46.850
which I'm doing
in the microscope

00:31:46.850 --> 00:31:50.330
here, beyond its
elastic capacity,

00:31:50.330 --> 00:31:52.280
it still can go back
to where it was.

00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:54.800
But when I let
go, it's not going

00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:56.300
to go back to where it is.

00:31:56.300 --> 00:32:00.410
It has taken on a new length.

00:32:00.410 --> 00:32:03.830
It is this kind of ability
to, not only stretch,

00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:07.880
but lengthen, to ease out.
to restore the glide that

00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:11.180
is the basis of
hatha yoga, which

00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:14.432
is the basis of the
kind of work that I do.

00:32:14.432 --> 00:32:15.890
And there are a
number of practices

00:32:15.890 --> 00:32:18.980
who are going to reach into
these kinds of properties

00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:21.560
of the fascia.

00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:25.400
And if you start to look,
I'd draw your attention

00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:27.800
to this structure.

00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:31.220
We start to see the
relationship between the fascia

00:32:31.220 --> 00:32:34.580
and the bones as being
one where the bones are

00:32:34.580 --> 00:32:41.460
floating inside a balanced
set of fascial pulls.

00:32:41.460 --> 00:32:44.250
So these sticks are not
touching each other.

00:32:44.250 --> 00:32:46.380
And the response
of the system is

00:32:46.380 --> 00:32:49.080
a response of the whole system.

00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:53.220
And when you injure a system
and one part becomes fixed,

00:32:53.220 --> 00:32:55.980
then the rest of it doesn't
respond properly around that.

00:32:55.980 --> 00:32:58.210
And the pain may
end up over here,

00:32:58.210 --> 00:33:00.120
even though the
injury is over here.

00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:03.690
So understanding our body
in a different way from--

00:33:03.690 --> 00:33:06.330
there is a skeletal framework.

00:33:06.330 --> 00:33:09.210
Muscles are hanging
off skeletal framework.

00:33:09.210 --> 00:33:13.930
I will use supraspinatus for the
first 15 degrees of abduction,

00:33:13.930 --> 00:33:15.750
then I will use the
deltoid, until I

00:33:15.750 --> 00:33:17.520
get to 89 degrees
of abduction, then

00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:19.710
I will use the trapeze
for the remaining degrees.

00:33:19.710 --> 00:33:25.260
That is a robotic idea which
has gotten us a lot of knowledge

00:33:25.260 --> 00:33:26.760
over the last several
hundred years.

00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:30.840
But that model is running
out of its usefulness.

00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:35.520
This model is, I think, going
to be more useful as we move

00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:40.030
forward to understand how
the athlete, the performer,

00:33:40.030 --> 00:33:42.330
the person who's getting
old, the person who

00:33:42.330 --> 00:33:46.350
has neurological problems
or post-injury problems,

00:33:46.350 --> 00:33:51.540
that we can restore this
kind of dynamic balance

00:33:51.540 --> 00:33:55.830
where everything is
giving a little bit.

00:33:55.830 --> 00:33:59.430
Tiger Woods, when he
was doing his swing--

00:33:59.430 --> 00:34:01.870
if you watch my feet now,
never mind my golf swing

00:34:01.870 --> 00:34:04.350
because I don't play golf--

00:34:04.350 --> 00:34:07.049
I'm going up on the
outside of my right foot

00:34:07.049 --> 00:34:08.340
and the inside of my left foot.

00:34:08.340 --> 00:34:10.131
In other words, I'm
supinating on my right,

00:34:10.131 --> 00:34:13.560
pronating on my left, I
expect to be right on my feet

00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:15.630
at the moment that I
connect with the ball

00:34:15.630 --> 00:34:17.159
on the tripods of my feet.

00:34:17.159 --> 00:34:19.469
And then I expect
to do the opposite

00:34:19.469 --> 00:34:21.130
to come onto the
inside of this foot

00:34:21.130 --> 00:34:24.510
and the outside of my left
foot during the follow through.

00:34:24.510 --> 00:34:26.310
If you watch him
in the early days,

00:34:26.310 --> 00:34:28.949
he did all of those things
except in the follow through.

00:34:28.949 --> 00:34:33.090
His left foot stayed
on the ground.

00:34:33.090 --> 00:34:34.080
What does that do?

00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:36.000
That means that
rotational energy

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.969
is going to be thrust
up to the next joint.

00:34:38.969 --> 00:34:41.670
So where did he end up having
his first set of problems?

00:34:41.670 --> 00:34:44.310
Not in his back, but
in his left knee.

00:34:44.310 --> 00:34:46.230
But the problems
in the left knee

00:34:46.230 --> 00:34:50.280
where the lack of
movement in the left foot.

00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:54.780
So if you start thinking about
the fascia in a dynamic way

00:34:54.780 --> 00:35:01.350
this way and thinking about
the fascial system in this kind

00:35:01.350 --> 00:35:04.440
of dynamic way, then
your treatment plans

00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:06.330
and operations
change, especially

00:35:06.330 --> 00:35:08.940
for what you're going to
do from chronic injury.

00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:11.430
We tend to focus on
the part that's hurt.

00:35:11.430 --> 00:35:14.070
We tend to focus on the
structure that failed,

00:35:14.070 --> 00:35:17.340
not looking at the context in
which that failure takes place.

00:35:17.340 --> 00:35:19.620
So especially for
chronic injury,

00:35:19.620 --> 00:35:22.510
this becomes very important.

00:35:22.510 --> 00:35:23.920
How did the body--

00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:25.500
I'm still on my design question.

00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:27.780
How did the body get
through this design thing?

00:35:27.780 --> 00:35:30.960
What you're seeing
here is the engine.

00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:34.410
You've got millions of
these cells crawling

00:35:34.410 --> 00:35:35.170
around your body.

00:35:35.170 --> 00:35:36.930
They're called fibroblasts.

00:35:36.930 --> 00:35:39.120
That means they're
making the fiber.

00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:42.430
And if you look-- the fiber is
green, and the cell is orange.

00:35:42.430 --> 00:35:45.880
If you look at this
film from Friedel,

00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:48.510
you see that the
orange cell is leaving

00:35:48.510 --> 00:35:51.810
a trail of green behind it as it
moves through the green field,

00:35:51.810 --> 00:35:52.410
right?

00:35:52.410 --> 00:35:54.510
It's on a three-dimensional
spider web.

00:35:54.510 --> 00:35:56.550
It's literally got
little hooks on it,

00:35:56.550 --> 00:35:59.100
and it's crawling its way
through that spider web

00:35:59.100 --> 00:36:01.440
and leaving a trail
of slime behind it.

00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:03.420
So hate to tell you
this, but you've

00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:06.160
got millions of little slugs
running around your body

00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:07.930
leaving trails of slime.

00:36:07.930 --> 00:36:10.320
And then what happens to
those trails of slime?

00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:16.320
Well, if you're a couch potato,
they remain trails of slime

00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:18.120
and become part of
the sloopy bit which

00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:20.580
is stopping you from having
circulation happening around

00:36:20.580 --> 00:36:21.390
your body.

00:36:21.390 --> 00:36:25.590
If you are moving, then that
slime forms into all the things

00:36:25.590 --> 00:36:28.740
that the slime can form into
to make your body work--

00:36:28.740 --> 00:36:34.260
bone, cartilage,
tendon, ligament--

00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:37.380
whatever it needs to be
according to the needs

00:36:37.380 --> 00:36:39.990
that you put on it.

00:36:39.990 --> 00:36:42.660
Over the arch of my school,
when I finally have one,

00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:48.340
will be a golden thing that says
the body responds to demand.

00:36:48.340 --> 00:36:50.290
So whatever demand
you put on the body,

00:36:50.290 --> 00:36:51.680
you're going to get that body.

00:36:51.680 --> 00:36:54.630
A palates body-- I can recognize
people who've done it--

00:36:54.630 --> 00:36:57.540
puts a palates demand,
creates a palates body.

00:36:57.540 --> 00:37:00.025
I know palates is getting
different now and all that.

00:37:00.025 --> 00:37:02.400
Same with yoga-- there's so
many different kinds of yoga.

00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:05.950
But you can recognize what
runnering does to a body

00:37:05.950 --> 00:37:07.200
because it's a running demand.

00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:10.380
You can recognize what
Olympic lifting does to a body

00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:12.180
because it's an
Olympic lifting demand.

00:37:12.180 --> 00:37:15.900
And different bodies are
suited to different bits.

00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:18.120
And when you load
these cells up--

00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:21.780
that's the same cell in the
center of the picture there.

00:37:21.780 --> 00:37:26.430
And you can see in this, if
you take the time to examine it

00:37:26.430 --> 00:37:30.210
that, if you don't do enough
to stimulate the cell,

00:37:30.210 --> 00:37:33.720
you're going to get fibrosis
and lacks of flexibility

00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:34.830
and a lack of strength.

00:37:34.830 --> 00:37:38.040
If you overdo it, you're going
to get another kind of fibrosis

00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:41.110
and edema around the cell.

00:37:41.110 --> 00:37:42.794
And if you just
do enough-- that's

00:37:42.794 --> 00:37:44.460
the gray one in the
middle-- then you'll

00:37:44.460 --> 00:37:46.170
maintain the status quo.

00:37:46.170 --> 00:37:48.810
But trainers are looking
for that green idea

00:37:48.810 --> 00:37:50.550
of building the fascia.

00:37:50.550 --> 00:37:53.520
Now fascia builds
slower than muscle.

00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:55.770
You can't get the fascial
system to build up

00:37:55.770 --> 00:37:56.730
as fast as a muscle.

00:37:56.730 --> 00:37:58.770
That's why lots of
people get injuries

00:37:58.770 --> 00:38:02.310
when they come into you and say,
I got to get in shape for my--

00:38:02.310 --> 00:38:03.360
whoa.

00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:06.600
I've got to get in shape
for my thing this summer.

00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:07.890
Please get me in shape.

00:38:07.890 --> 00:38:10.830
And so you build up the
muscles if you're a trainer,

00:38:10.830 --> 00:38:14.010
and they have a fascial injury
because the muscles build

00:38:14.010 --> 00:38:15.900
faster than the fascia does.

00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:17.970
The consequence of
this is, we start

00:38:17.970 --> 00:38:22.170
to look at how the muscles are
strung together in the body

00:38:22.170 --> 00:38:24.570
to create these things
that I call anatomy trains

00:38:24.570 --> 00:38:27.120
or myofascial
meridians to understand

00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:32.760
the way in which the body
pattern works as a tensegrity

00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:36.120
so that we can understand how
these things are communicated

00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:38.580
from one place to the other,
how the problem in the arch

00:38:38.580 --> 00:38:42.060
becomes a problem in the knee
becomes a problem in the back.

00:38:42.060 --> 00:38:45.750
So we've been looking
at these kinds of things

00:38:45.750 --> 00:38:50.700
and coming up with the different
ways in which the body connects

00:38:50.700 --> 00:38:52.280
from one side to the other.

00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:56.160
I am just going to call a halt
to this now and leave time

00:38:56.160 --> 00:38:58.890
for people who want
to ask questions.

00:38:58.890 --> 00:39:00.660
AUDIENCE: Do you
have a discussion

00:39:00.660 --> 00:39:06.180
about how much diet is
related to this in terms

00:39:06.180 --> 00:39:07.770
of keeping the fascia healthy?

00:39:07.770 --> 00:39:11.250
You touched on it a
little bit about what

00:39:11.250 --> 00:39:13.790
we're putting in our body in
terms of having inflammation

00:39:13.790 --> 00:39:15.420
and not have inflammation.

00:39:15.420 --> 00:39:19.710
So is there something you
could say to that question?

00:39:19.710 --> 00:39:23.400
TOM MYERS: Absolutely,
although I am not a dietitian.

00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:25.290
I personally am on
a seafood diet--

00:39:25.290 --> 00:39:27.380
if I see food I eat it.

00:39:27.380 --> 00:39:33.390
However, but the idea here is,
you need the 22 amino acids

00:39:33.390 --> 00:39:37.080
to produce the various types
of collagen and other proteins,

00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:39.300
fiber, nectin, et
cetera hyaluronan

00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:41.490
that you have in your body.

00:39:41.490 --> 00:39:43.470
So adequate supplies
of protein, which

00:39:43.470 --> 00:39:46.740
can get a little dicey
with a vegan, a really

00:39:46.740 --> 00:39:48.780
restricted diet.

00:39:48.780 --> 00:39:51.510
Otherwise, the main
thing that I can say

00:39:51.510 --> 00:39:56.220
is that we put maybe too many
irritants in there in terms

00:39:56.220 --> 00:39:58.020
of hot food and coffee.

00:39:58.020 --> 00:40:02.200
Some people, that will really
affect how their body works.

00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:04.060
But the main thing is sugar.

00:40:04.060 --> 00:40:07.080
I said that the gluey stuff
was mucopolysaccharides.

00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:09.390
The more sugar you eat, the
stickier that stuff gets.

00:40:09.390 --> 00:40:12.540
The stickier it gets, the
less it lets the nutrients

00:40:12.540 --> 00:40:14.280
through to the
muscles, the liver, the

00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:16.800
whatever it is around.

00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:20.760
So oversugaring our kids,
oversugaring ourselves

00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:24.330
is probably the dietary
thing that we do the most.

00:40:24.330 --> 00:40:26.610
Then, beyond that,
it's individual things

00:40:26.610 --> 00:40:29.880
that people are allergic
to or semiallergic to that

00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:32.050
just make it harder for
them physiologically.

00:40:32.050 --> 00:40:32.675
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:40:32.675 --> 00:40:35.730
I think we're just discovering
how bad sugar is actually

00:40:35.730 --> 00:40:36.520
for us.

00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:36.810
TOM MYERS: Yeah.

00:40:36.810 --> 00:40:38.080
AUDIENCE: Yeah, OK, thank you.

00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:39.480
TOM MYERS: You're welcome.

00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:40.230
AUDIENCE: Hi, Tom.

00:40:40.230 --> 00:40:43.050
I had a question about
the plastination.

00:40:43.050 --> 00:40:46.440
Do you know what the
state is that that is in?

00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:49.535
Are they getting close to having
something that can presented?

00:40:49.535 --> 00:40:50.160
TOM MYERS: Yes.

00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:52.860
They have some things
that have been presented.

00:40:52.860 --> 00:40:57.690
They're going to be presented
at the 5th Fascial Research

00:40:57.690 --> 00:41:00.120
Congress, which is
taking place in Berlin

00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:02.370
in a couple of months.

00:41:02.370 --> 00:41:06.329
And they have done things
such as that, like the thigh

00:41:06.329 --> 00:41:08.370
that I had where we went
down through the layers.

00:41:08.370 --> 00:41:10.290
They've gone down through
the layers in the wrist

00:41:10.290 --> 00:41:12.748
from the bone, and then you
see the next one, the next one,

00:41:12.748 --> 00:41:14.730
the next one out to the skin.

00:41:14.730 --> 00:41:16.890
That's one that
they have looked at.

00:41:16.890 --> 00:41:19.200
They took a section
of the lower leg

00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:21.750
and took out all
the muscle, again,

00:41:21.750 --> 00:41:23.145
looking like some of the things.

00:41:23.145 --> 00:41:25.020
They're trying to recreate
some of the images

00:41:25.020 --> 00:41:26.280
that we already have.

00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:33.180
But because fascia is the
context for everything else,

00:41:33.180 --> 00:41:36.450
it's really hard to take
everything else out and leave

00:41:36.450 --> 00:41:38.100
the fascia intact.

00:41:38.100 --> 00:41:40.470
So what you would like--

00:41:40.470 --> 00:41:43.560
I would like to go back
to the Vesalius's lab

00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:45.300
and steal all his knives.

00:41:45.300 --> 00:41:47.700
Because when we went to
examine the human body,

00:41:47.700 --> 00:41:49.290
we examined it
with the same thing

00:41:49.290 --> 00:41:51.970
that hunters did with animals.

00:41:51.970 --> 00:41:53.490
We cut it up with a blade.

00:41:53.490 --> 00:41:55.590
And our anatomy that
you've seen in your books

00:41:55.590 --> 00:41:57.366
is anatomy of a blade.

00:41:57.366 --> 00:41:59.490
But if I could get back to
the Vesalius's workshop,

00:41:59.490 --> 00:42:02.330
take my time machine
and go back to 1540,

00:42:02.330 --> 00:42:04.410
I would take away
all these knives

00:42:04.410 --> 00:42:06.720
and leave him with a vat
of furniture stripper

00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:08.355
or some other kind of solvent.

00:42:08.355 --> 00:42:10.980
And he would come in the morning
and say, (WITH ITALIAN ACCENT)

00:42:10.980 --> 00:42:13.530
oh, somebody took
all of my scalpels.

00:42:13.530 --> 00:42:17.010
So I will instead put
the body in the solvent

00:42:17.010 --> 00:42:18.750
and see what happens.

00:42:18.750 --> 00:42:21.990
And he would have taken
out the extracellular

00:42:21.990 --> 00:42:26.040
matrix which is the thing
that every cell lives in.

00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:28.590
It would be a three-dimensional
network that wouldn't just

00:42:28.590 --> 00:42:29.610
cover your muscles.

00:42:29.610 --> 00:42:33.060
It would show you the shape
of your brain, of your liver,

00:42:33.060 --> 00:42:36.540
of everything has to
be in this network.

00:42:36.540 --> 00:42:39.660
So it draws together, not only
all the parts of the body,

00:42:39.660 --> 00:42:41.970
in a very real way, the
fascia draws together

00:42:41.970 --> 00:42:43.950
all the branches of medicine.

00:42:43.950 --> 00:42:46.740
And I think we're going to be
discovering a lot more about it

00:42:46.740 --> 00:42:48.660
in the next 40 years.

00:42:48.660 --> 00:42:51.392
It's not that fascia is more
important than anything else.

00:42:51.392 --> 00:42:53.350
It's just we haven't paid
much attention to it.

00:42:53.350 --> 00:42:55.933
So we need to pay some attention
to it now just to catch it up

00:42:55.933 --> 00:42:57.630
to the other places.

00:42:57.630 --> 00:42:58.320
Yeah.

00:42:58.320 --> 00:43:01.140
Did I get to your
question at all?

00:43:01.140 --> 00:43:03.390
AUDIENCE: I found it interesting
that you were stating

00:43:03.390 --> 00:43:07.950
that many of the injuries occur
from people trying to get fit

00:43:07.950 --> 00:43:11.100
and building the muscle
before the fascia has a chance

00:43:11.100 --> 00:43:12.670
to catch up to it.

00:43:12.670 --> 00:43:17.010
So I'm curious if there are
activities or things that

00:43:17.010 --> 00:43:19.680
help to promote
fascia or to help

00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:23.370
the development of the fascia
in the muscle come more

00:43:23.370 --> 00:43:28.380
in alignment, or if it's
just slowing down training.

00:43:28.380 --> 00:43:31.050
TOM MYERS: Slowing
down training is--

00:43:31.050 --> 00:43:33.330
most of the people
who come into training

00:43:33.330 --> 00:43:37.140
have that real goal-directed
rather than process-directed

00:43:37.140 --> 00:43:37.990
mentality.

00:43:37.990 --> 00:43:41.155
And it's the job of the trainer
to slow them down a little bit.

00:43:41.155 --> 00:43:43.530
You think of the people who
have been working on training

00:43:43.530 --> 00:43:46.510
for 2,000 or 3,000 years.

00:43:46.510 --> 00:43:49.380
Yoga generally goes-- I know
there's all kinds of yogas now,

00:43:49.380 --> 00:43:54.030
but yoga generally went
very slowly so as not to--

00:43:54.030 --> 00:43:55.750
I don't have a piece
of plastic up here.

00:43:55.750 --> 00:43:59.160
But if you can imagine me with a
plastic bag, if I do it slowly,

00:43:59.160 --> 00:44:00.150
the bag will stretch.

00:44:00.150 --> 00:44:02.460
If I do it quickly,
the bag will tear.

00:44:02.460 --> 00:44:06.990
So moving slowly is
definitely a boon

00:44:06.990 --> 00:44:09.880
to not having overuse injuries.

00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:16.200
So if yoga is slow, the things
like Tai Chi move very slowly,

00:44:16.200 --> 00:44:19.835
and that is going
to have less injury.

00:44:19.835 --> 00:44:21.210
The other thing
that I would love

00:44:21.210 --> 00:44:25.290
to see for kids, because all the
movement that we do with kids

00:44:25.290 --> 00:44:29.430
is so directed towards
a goal, and I love--

00:44:29.430 --> 00:44:31.740
I studied with a woman
named Emilie Conrad who

00:44:31.740 --> 00:44:37.080
did biomorphing motion,
like, animal-imitation motion

00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:39.850
just to have flows and
waves go through your body.

00:44:39.850 --> 00:44:42.900
And I would love to see kids
get that kind of training

00:44:42.900 --> 00:44:44.880
instead of how many
pushups can you do?

00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:47.312
Or can you go up the peg board?

00:44:47.312 --> 00:44:48.270
Can you climb the rope?

00:44:48.270 --> 00:44:49.894
Those kinds of things,
those are great.

00:44:49.894 --> 00:44:51.210
I'm not putting them down.

00:44:51.210 --> 00:44:54.060
But for kids simply to
explore their movement

00:44:54.060 --> 00:44:58.920
for the joy of movement and
to emphasize what they can do

00:44:58.920 --> 00:45:00.960
rather than what
they can't do, I

00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:05.220
think would be a really nice
thing for the next generation

00:45:05.220 --> 00:45:06.600
of kids that we're bringing up.

00:45:06.600 --> 00:45:09.370
Kids are going to become very
precious resources, guys,

00:45:09.370 --> 00:45:11.650
in your world.

00:45:11.650 --> 00:45:13.800
We used to have
seven kids in hopes

00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:15.810
that four kids would
live to take care of us

00:45:15.810 --> 00:45:18.960
when we were old.

00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:19.650
I kid you not.

00:45:19.650 --> 00:45:21.667
It is now a tragedy
if a child dies.

00:45:21.667 --> 00:45:23.250
If you had a child
die in your family,

00:45:23.250 --> 00:45:24.780
I am really sorry for you.

00:45:24.780 --> 00:45:29.520
There is nothing worse
that I can think of.

00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:32.220
Because we invest so
much in each child--

00:45:32.220 --> 00:45:34.560
and now my daughter,
who works for Google,

00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:37.560
and lots and lots of people who
are probably not going to have

00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:38.550
children--

00:45:38.550 --> 00:45:42.519
and that means that the children
who are here, the Indigo

00:45:42.519 --> 00:45:44.310
children or whatever
you want to call them,

00:45:44.310 --> 00:45:47.497
those kids are going to
be very, very important.

00:45:47.497 --> 00:45:49.830
Because they're going to take
care of us when we're old.

00:45:49.830 --> 00:45:50.996
That's you, when you're old.

00:45:50.996 --> 00:45:52.650
I'm already out of here.

00:45:52.650 --> 00:45:56.220
But in order to do that,
those have to be super kids.

00:45:56.220 --> 00:45:58.625
So we'd better raise them
really strong and healthy

00:45:58.625 --> 00:46:01.125
because they're going to have
to take care of lots of people

00:46:01.125 --> 00:46:03.275
when they're old.

00:46:03.275 --> 00:46:04.900
I know it's not going
to work that way,

00:46:04.900 --> 00:46:06.880
but you know what I mean.

00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:08.580
Kids are precious.

00:46:08.580 --> 00:46:12.620
How they get taught into
movement is an important thing.

00:46:12.620 --> 00:46:13.120
Thanks.

00:46:13.120 --> 00:46:15.870
