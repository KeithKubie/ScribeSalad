00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:01.440
All right.
To introduce you to temporal

00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:02.450
difference learning.

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:05.280
It helps to have a little bit of
context about reinforcement learning in

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:06.260
a more general way.

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:08.310
So we can see how
the different methods for

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:10.760
doing reinforcement
learning fit together.

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:11.790
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.410
&gt;&gt; So, I'm going to think about
reinforcement learning this way.

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:19.040
Remember we talked about SARS,
the state-action-reward sequence.

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.160
So, I'm in a state.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:20.760
I take an action.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:21.550
I get a reward back.

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:23.410
I end up in a new state.

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:24.290
I take a new action.

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:25.000
I get a new reward.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.570
And this just continues, so
I put a little Kleene star after it.

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.450
To indicate that this is some
sequence of state, action, rewards.

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:34.510
That's what comes as input to
a reinforcement learning algorithm.

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.740
And what the reinforcement learning
algorithm produces as output

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:38.450
is a policy.

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:39.540
&gt;&gt; Sure, that makes sense.

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.826
Hey, I got a quick notational
question for you though.

00:00:41.826 --> 00:00:44.110
&gt;&gt; Sure.
&gt;&gt; Should that really be a Kleene star,

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:45.530
or should that be a plus?

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.620
Well I'm being a little bit
lax with notation here.

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.060
But I'm imagining that,

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:52.310
even if you give a reinforcement
learning algorithm no history at all.

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:54.330
It could still come out
with an initial policy.

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:55.040
&gt;&gt; Sure that makes sense.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.970
In fact, I guess that's true for
every algorithm we've ever talked about.

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:59.750
&gt;&gt; I think so.

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.980
I mean it could be just be a default
policy like in all states take whatever

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:04.340
the first action is.

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:05.950
But the fact of the matter is over time.

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.630
The interesting case is when we've
had some amount of history and

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.550
we're trying to map
that to some behavior.

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:12.700
&gt;&gt; Okay I'm on the same page.
