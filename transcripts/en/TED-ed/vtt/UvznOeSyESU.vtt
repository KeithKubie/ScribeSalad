00:00:06.947 --> 00:00:10.997
Claps of thunder and flashes of lightning
illuminate a swelling sea,

00:00:10.997 --> 00:00:14.297
as a ship buckles beneath the waves. 

00:00:14.297 --> 00:00:19.337
This is no ordinary storm, 
but a violent and vengeful tempest,

00:00:19.337 --> 00:00:24.047
and it sets the stage for Shakespeare’s
most enigmatic play.

00:00:24.047 --> 00:00:27.097
As the skies clear, 
we are invited into a world

00:00:27.107 --> 00:00:31.637
that seems far removed from our own,
but is rife with familiar concerns

00:00:31.637 --> 00:00:35.577
about freedom, power, and control.

00:00:35.577 --> 00:00:39.387
The Tempest is set on a desert island,
exposed to the elements

00:00:39.387 --> 00:00:44.717
and ruled with magic and might by 
Prospero, the exiled Duke of Milan.

00:00:44.717 --> 00:00:49.417
Betrayed by his brother Antonio, 
Prospero has been marooned on the island

00:00:49.417 --> 00:00:54.307
for twelve years with his daughter Miranda
and his beloved books.

00:00:54.307 --> 00:00:57.627
In this time he’s learned the 
magic of the island

00:00:57.627 --> 00:01:00.887
and uses it to harness its 
elementary spirits.

00:01:00.887 --> 00:01:04.617
He also rules over the island’s
only earthly inhabitant,

00:01:04.617 --> 00:01:08.167
the dejected and demonized Caliban.

00:01:08.167 --> 00:01:13.467
But after years of plotting revenge,
Prospero’s foe is finally in sight.

00:01:13.467 --> 00:01:16.277
With the help of the 
fluttering sprite Ariel,

00:01:16.277 --> 00:01:21.987
the magician destroys his brother’s ship
and washes its sailors ashore.

00:01:21.987 --> 00:01:25.677
Prospero’s plotting even extends to his
daughter’s love life,

00:01:25.677 --> 00:01:29.707
whom he plans to fall for 
stranded prince Ferdinand.

00:01:29.707 --> 00:01:32.867
And as Prospero and Ariel
close in on Antonio,

00:01:32.867 --> 00:01:35.797
Caliban joins forces with some 
drunken sailors,

00:01:35.797 --> 00:01:39.317
who hatch a comic plot 
to take the island.

00:01:39.317 --> 00:01:42.957
The play strips society down
to its basest desires,

00:01:42.957 --> 00:01:48.287
with each faction in hot pursuit of power-
be it over the land, other people,

00:01:48.287 --> 00:01:50.307
or their own destiny.

00:01:50.307 --> 00:01:54.327
But Shakespeare knows that power is
always a moving target;

00:01:54.327 --> 00:01:57.047
and as he reveals
these characters’ dark histories,

00:01:57.047 --> 00:02:01.637
we begin to wonder if this
vicious cycle will ever end.

00:02:01.637 --> 00:02:04.447
Although Prospero was wronged by Antonio,

00:02:04.447 --> 00:02:07.787
he has long inflicted his
own abuses on the island,

00:02:07.787 --> 00:02:11.907
hoarding its magical properties
and natural re-sources for himself.

00:02:11.907 --> 00:02:15.117
Caliban especially resents
this takeover.

00:02:15.117 --> 00:02:17.054
The son of Sycorax,

00:02:17.054 --> 00:02:19.614
a witch who previously
ruled the island,

00:02:19.614 --> 00:02:22.564
he initially helped the 
exiles find their footing.

00:02:22.564 --> 00:02:26.814
But he’s since become their slave,
and rants with furious regret:

00:02:26.817 --> 00:02:29.537
“And then I loved thee,/
And showed thee

00:02:29.537 --> 00:02:32.497
all the qualities o’ th’ isle/
The fresh springs,

00:02:32.497 --> 00:02:35.857
brine pits, barren place 
and fertile./

00:02:35.857 --> 00:02:38.267
Cursed be I that did so!”

00:02:38.267 --> 00:02:41.117
With his thunderous language
and seething anger,

00:02:41.117 --> 00:02:45.347
Caliban constantly reminds
Prospero of what came before:

00:02:45.347 --> 00:02:50.347
this island’s mine by Sycorax my mother,
Which thou takest from me.

00:02:50.347 --> 00:02:52.998
Yet Sycorax also abused the island,

00:02:52.998 --> 00:02:56.248
and imprisoned Ariel until 
Prospero released him.

00:02:56.248 --> 00:03:00.898
Now Ariel spends the play hoping to repay
his debt and earn his freedom,

00:03:00.898 --> 00:03:04.818
while Caliban is enslaved indefinitely,
or at least as long

00:03:04.818 --> 00:03:07.458
as Prospero is in charge.

00:03:07.458 --> 00:03:09.558
For these reasons and many more,

00:03:09.558 --> 00:03:13.538
The Tempest has often been read as
an exploration of colonialism,

00:03:13.538 --> 00:03:18.158
and the moral dilemmas that come
with en-counters of “brave new world(s)."

00:03:18.158 --> 00:03:21.661
Questions of agency and justice
hang over the play:

00:03:21.661 --> 00:03:24.201
is Caliban the rightful 
master of the land?

00:03:24.201 --> 00:03:26.181
Will Ariel flutter free? 

00:03:26.181 --> 00:03:28.551
And is Prospero the 
mighty overseer-

00:03:28.551 --> 00:03:34.581
or is there some deeper magic at work,
beyond any one character's grasp?

00:03:34.581 --> 00:03:35.711
Throughout the play,

00:03:35.711 --> 00:03:39.521
Ariel constantly reminds Prospero
of the freedom he is owed.

00:03:39.521 --> 00:03:42.501
But the question lingers of whether
the invader will be able

00:03:42.501 --> 00:03:44.631
to relinquish his grip.

00:03:44.631 --> 00:03:48.861
The question of ending one’s reign is
particularly potent given that The Tempest

00:03:48.861 --> 00:03:52.431
is believed to be 
Shakespeare’s final play.

00:03:52.431 --> 00:03:57.011
In many ways Prospero’s actions echo that
of the great entertainer him-self,

00:03:57.011 --> 00:04:00.551
who hatched elaborate plots,
maneuvered those around him,

00:04:00.551 --> 00:04:05.501
and cast a spell over characters
and audience alike.

00:04:05.501 --> 00:04:09.256
But by the end of his grand performance
of power and control,

00:04:09.256 --> 00:04:12.942
Prospero’s final lines see him humbled
by his audience -

00:04:12.942 --> 00:04:16.712
and the power
that they hold over his creations.

00:04:16.712 --> 00:04:20.602
"With the help of your good hands./
Gentle breath of yours my sails/

00:04:20.602 --> 00:04:26.292
Must fill or else my project fails,/
Which was to please."

00:04:26.292 --> 00:04:30.042
This evokes Shakespeare’s own role
as the great entertainer

00:04:30.042 --> 00:04:34.982
who surrenders himself,
ultimately, to our applause.
