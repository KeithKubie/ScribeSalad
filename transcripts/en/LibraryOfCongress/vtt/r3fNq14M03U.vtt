00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:14.430
&gt;&gt; Mark Dimunation:
Welcome, everybody.

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:18.450
Hi. I'm Mark Dimunation, Chief
of the Division here and welcome

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:20.220
to another Thursday at Three.

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.300
I was going to wait ten minutes
because Michael was pacing,

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.900
but it just seemed
cruel [laughter].

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.450
So, so we're going to start on
time just to spare him that.

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:32.310
We're amongst friends here
but, in case you don't know,

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:34.500
Michael Platt and
Carol Beane, do I -

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.820
do we need the middle initials?

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.370
Michael B. Platt and Carol A.
Beane have been collaborating

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.430
on visual imagery and
artist book creations

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.690
for a good 18 years now,
since their first volume came

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.160
into the Library of
Congress in 2001.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.680
So, we're in for - and Carol, in
particular, is a familiar face

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.670
at these lectures and is
known to many of us here

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.630
in Washington as
are both of them.

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:02.940
So, we're really pleased
to have them here together,

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.500
and it's going to be
one of those moments.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.030
Michael creates - he's a
printmaker, but he now prefers

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.360
to be called an image
maker, is that correct?

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.660
&gt;&gt; Michael Platt: Yeah.

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:13.960
&gt;&gt; Mark Dimunation: Yes,
because he makes images,

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.260
rather than prints.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.090
And this can range from,
as I'm sure you will hear,

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.650
from small portfolios
to large walls

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.360
in school buildings,
recently, yes?

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.640
So, from print to mural.

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.120
Carol is a poet,
has been inspired

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:36.240
by the African Diaspora, but
also some other experiences

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.820
that have led her to
create, in some cases,

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.010
poetry that plays on
call and response.

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:46.240
And, together, the poetry
and the images are combined

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.350
into a single experience
which is quite moving.

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.330
You've had a chance to see
some of them and you're welcome

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.520
to come take a look
at them as well

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:55.850
after they're through speaking.

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.930
But it's a real pleasure
to have both of them here.

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:00.730
Would you please welcome them?

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:06.560
[ Applause ]

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:07.860
&gt;&gt; Michael Platt: I would just

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.790
like to thank you
all for coming out.

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:11.200
I feel like I'm playing
the big house,

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.870
this is like the how we did
in the '50s so [laughter].

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.170
It's really great.

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.000
I would like to really thank
my wife who had the nerve

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.430
to bring the first
book we did up here.

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.940
I thought she's out
of her mind, you know,

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.240
barely made an appointment.

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.720
She came up and she
came back home

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.320
with this big ass
grin on her face.

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.270
And I didn't even want to
know what happened, you know,

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.260
but it was - it was
good, it was really good.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.400
And, from there, we
just kept making books.

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.400
The first book we made was a -

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.570
I guess it was fulfilling
a promise she made

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:50.870
to her father who
had passed away.

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.300
She was supposed - what
were you writing it on?

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.170
&gt;&gt; Carol Beane: Slavery
in Black America.

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.860
Images of, and literary
correspondences.

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.500
&gt;&gt; Michael Platt: But
that didn't have anything

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.170
to - he passed away.

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:05.780
So, I said, "Carol, we're
going to make a book

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.220
and dedicate it to your father".

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.180
What are we going
to make a book on?

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.990
My images, her poems.

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:15.110
And, since I always had side
projects of making things,

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:20.460
I think that's what artists
do, they like to make things.

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:22.910
So, I decided to
make a little book.

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:25.190
And then we put it
together and we got lucky

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.800
in this collection, so.

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.510
&gt;&gt; Carol Beane: I think
one of the things, too,

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.770
that inspired me as well
Michael is Pyramid Atlantic,

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:39.390
whom I think most of you are in
the D.C. area are familiar with.

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:43.290
Michael used to go out there
and print, and he was invited,

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.790
when they got the
really huge printer,

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:48.190
to make the inaugural
print on that.

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.470
But you can't - you couldn't be
- you can't, and couldn't be,

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.500
at Pyramid Atlantic
without people all

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.240
around you doing books and
making paper and everything.

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.540
It was just wonderful.

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.420
And I would go home
and I would think,

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.000
that looks like something that's
really interesting and fun.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.660
So, the object was, it's
always been very important.

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:11.700
And then, my brother and I grew
up in a household with parents

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.820
who were New Yorkers and
we always had a library,

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:18.520
like a separate room
that was the library.

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:20.810
So, if you're a New
Yorker from the city,

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:22.490
you know, they're from Harlem.

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:25.250
Then you go to New York Public
Library and you're in Harlem,

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:27.700
you go to the Schomburg
Center and, in fact,

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:31.950
he worked on that during
WPA days, way back when.

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:33.250
So, there was all that.

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.650
And then he came to Howard as a
student, so he actually worked

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:36.950
at the Library of Congress.

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:39.990
That was one of his jobs back
in the late '30s, early '40s.

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:43.270
So, it's wonderful to be
here and so I thank Mark

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:45.830
and I thank John Cole who was
the Director for the Center

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:49.220
for the Book, I don't know if he
still is, I hope so, who said,

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:51.200
"You need to go over and
talk to Mark Dimunation".

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:55.770
And then, the familiar faces and
people who I've gotten to know

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:58.140
and Christina Wasserman,
because someone said,

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:59.700
"You really should go
and talk to the people

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:02.840
at the National Museum
of Women in the Arts"

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:06.140
because they have a tremendous
artist book collection.

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:11.460
So, it's been an experience of,
you know, increased friendships

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:14.760
and growth and finding
out about new materials

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:16.060
and new technologies.

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:19.230
So, we had been married
about ten years

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:23.500
when Michael decided we should
do this first book because I,

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:26.930
as an academic, my
academic writing always came

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:28.570
with great difficulty.

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:32.950
But I always wrote poetry
from when I was little and,

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:35.710
the thing is, I never showed
it to very many people,

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:38.060
in fact, hardly anybody.

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:42.120
So, this is the first
book, "Forgotten contours"

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:46.120
which you've seen on the
table there, and which Mark

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.120
and the collection has.

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:53.170
And the paper, this handmade
paper from Pyramid Atlantic

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:55.950
that we've - I kind
of fell in love with.

00:05:55.950 --> 00:06:00.400
And everything else was
done on our kitchen table.

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:07.220
So, our whole house is
basically a studio [laughter].

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:12.510
And the poem, this is a
favorite of mine at the time

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:18.950
in late, late 1990s and 2000s.

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:22.010
I had been going
through a lot of losses.

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:29.180
My son, that was back in
'95 and other close friends.

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:34.480
And so, a lot of the poem
- poetry that I was writing

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:40.090
at that time was poetry
about loss and about pain,

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:43.230
both personally and
then, thinking about it

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:45.900
in talking with, you know,

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:48.760
friends who were doing research
projects on, for example,

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:52.000
slavery, displacement,
migration.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.520
These are also personal things
that touch us very deeply,

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:59.350
but they're also reflected
in the world around us.

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:03.070
And this is one of
those, the first poems.

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:09.030
Sorrow cuts so finely that, at
first, we do not feel its edge.

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:12.390
We wait for the joy
after sadness.

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:14.630
It is long in coming,

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:18.430
and we fear that we will
have forgotten its contours.

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:28.750
This, this is the end piece
of that - of that first book.

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:31.200
Michael, in the late
'90s, had done a series

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:35.660
of wonderful charcoal drawings
that I loved, based on a book

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:39.780
of South African photographs
of the Bushmen of South Africa.

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:44.920
And he began to do these
drawings and, I think,

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:51.040
making the - with the goal
of making the photograph more

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:54.170
of a personal statement.

00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:55.740
And I think you can
see that in this one.

00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:59.260
So, this was one of the ones
of that series that he did,

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.460
they were quite large.

00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:08.950
And it's - the poem which is
I called, "Mother's Stories"

00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:14.090
because my father died in '98
and my mother came to live

00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:18.560
with us in D.C. And
she had some dementia,

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:20.750
probably not Alzheimer's
but, and anyway,

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:23.600
every day was a new day and
every hour was a new hour

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:25.070
and every minute
was a new minute.

00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:26.370
&gt;&gt; Michael Platt: Literally.

00:08:26.370 --> 00:08:27.670
&gt;&gt; Carol Beane: And
so, she would -

00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:28.970
she would come downstairs
in the morning

00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:30.630
and she was basically
our proofreader

00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:35.230
because she would look at this
one was a favorite poem of hers.

00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:37.080
She didn't make the connection.

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:40.760
So, this one is, Mother's
stories are long in telling.

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:43.090
I sometimes feel
the silent echoes

00:08:43.090 --> 00:08:46.530
of resonances beyond
their daughter's knowing.

00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:52.680
So, we wait and listen carefully
to fragments and nuances

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:55.210
and hope to be around when
they get in the friend -

00:08:55.210 --> 00:08:58.030
with their friends in
the kitchen and begin

00:08:58.030 --> 00:09:03.640
with the remember whens and
the, well, did I ever tell you,

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:06.730
and the, oh, you
should have seens.

00:09:06.730 --> 00:09:10.540
Now, we have come more
fully to understand how

00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:16.480
and why they still call each
other "girl" or some say cher.

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:19.430
But this is more
infrequent than we'd like.

00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:24.850
And sooner, rather than later,
it is violated by illness

00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:29.830
and failings and forgettings
and the falling away

00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:35.790
of friends till there are few
with whom to sit and talk.

00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:38.140
My mother would come
downstairs and she would say,

00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:40.050
"I think I really
like this poem".

00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:41.980
So, one day, Michael
said, "Oris,

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:44.170
that poem's about you,
don't you know that?"

00:09:44.170 --> 00:09:47.220
[Laughter] And she
just kind of looked.

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:48.540
&gt;&gt; Michael Platt: Sometimes,
when she would come down,

00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:52.170
I gave her the nickname
Old Eagle Eyes.

00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:55.900
She was a third-grade
teacher in New York,

00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:57.400
and she would find the mistake.

00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:59.670
And I think I'm ready
for production, you know,

00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:02.400
sometimes after I
printed the first one.

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:06.000
But she'll find it so I
used to call her Eagle Eyes.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:13.350
But this was a really,
this book is probably one

00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:14.910
of my favorite ones when I think

00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:17.740
about the whole process,
the first one.

00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:21.290
You know, it's like
always trying to get back

00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:22.590
to our first high [laughter].

00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:26.710
This is "Solitary Moments".

00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:34.310
This was - usually, I
would do a set of drawings.

00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:37.610
And the drawings I would work
on, or paintings or images

00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:41.150
or prints I work from, usually
came from the preceding one.

00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:44.750
So, a lot of times, it's not
with a specific subject matter

00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:46.200
in mind, I just -
you work your way

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:49.090
into a [inaudible],
a theme, you know.

00:10:49.090 --> 00:10:53.760
Solitary moments,
solitary mornings.

00:10:53.760 --> 00:11:01.590
Most of these images are
40 by 60, they're large.

00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:07.580
And it's been my experiences,
when you draw and you paint

00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:12.450
and you print, coming up with
that right size that people,

00:11:12.450 --> 00:11:14.820
so they won't be all in
the basement, you know.

00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:19.740
So, but I hung on to this
40 by 60 which is, you know,

00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:21.950
about that size, the size I am.

00:11:21.950 --> 00:11:25.560
I got that from a
teacher up at Howard,

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:28.750
one of my favorite teachers
there, [inaudible] passed away.

00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:33.420
And this is from a combination

00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:36.770
of a courtyard in,
was it - in Africa.

00:11:36.770 --> 00:11:41.920
And in Ghana in one
of the slave castles -

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:46.140
I call them slave castles.

00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:51.210
And I like the textures
in the head.

00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:54.790
In other words, I keep working
on these things till they feel

00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:56.700
like my drawings
or my paintings.

00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:58.000
[Inaudible].

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.760
&gt;&gt; Carol Beane: Put
it on vibrate.

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:04.280
&gt;&gt; Michael Platt: I'm
going to have to hit that.

00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:06.200
I can't find anything.

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:09.240
&gt;&gt; Carol Beane: New
technologies.

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:12.990
&gt;&gt; Michael Platt: So, just like
a lot of the other mediums,

00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:15.170
I keep putting thing -
putting things together,

00:12:15.170 --> 00:12:19.770
overlapping images, overlapping
textures, overlapping figures,

00:12:19.770 --> 00:12:24.960
overlapping spaces
till I find magic.

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:30.220
And, when that magic hits
you, sometimes it takes a lot

00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:34.280
of nerve to stop and not
overdevelop the magic.

00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:37.150
So, that's another thing I
got into, just I don't care

00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:39.920
if it doesn't feel finished,
just stop because that's

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:41.870
when I feel the magic.

00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:44.890
But sometimes you cheat and you
work on it a little bit more,

00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:47.780
but that usually happens
around 4:00 in the morning.

00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:49.980
Because I work -
I work at night.

00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:54.030
And I pull out the
champagne, I won today.

00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:57.250
Don't win every day, but you
do win every now and then.

00:12:57.250 --> 00:12:59.980
You know, but most artists would
tell you, no matter what we say,

00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:04.250
we've got a lot of stuff in
the basement that didn't work.

00:13:04.250 --> 00:13:06.780
Most of the stuff
we do does not work.

00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:08.980
I don't care what they say.

00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:10.280
It's true.

00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:11.610
All you've got to do, wait
till somebody dies and go

00:13:11.610 --> 00:13:12.910
in their basement,
[laughter] see all

00:13:12.910 --> 00:13:14.210
that stuff they didn't
get rid of.

00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:16.550
&gt;&gt; Carol Beane: I just wanted
to say, too, that the first book

00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:21.170
that we showed you, I had a body
of work that was done already

00:13:21.170 --> 00:13:23.810
and Michael had the
images that he had worked.

00:13:23.810 --> 00:13:27.760
So, that case, it was a matter
of seeing what went with what.

00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:32.140
And sometimes, for the most
part, we were, I think, lucky.

00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:37.440
The second - the second book was
some of that, but more writing

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:39.750
to the pieces, but
we definitely knew

00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:41.720
that we didn't want
to illustrate them.

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:44.920
We just wanted a
feel back and forth.

00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:49.880
This image, the model,
as it turned out, was,

00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:52.270
I think her father was Nigerian.

00:13:52.270 --> 00:13:55.760
But she just had a
tremendous presence about her.

00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:59.120
And she - there's another
image of her in the portfolio

00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:01.170
that you can see on the
side, if you didn't already.

00:14:01.170 --> 00:14:02.670
And this was a poem
that goes with that,

00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:05.600
I'd just like to
read that as well.

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:07.960
This refers to the
- our experience

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:11.640
of having visited the slave
castles or the slave factories

00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:16.700
as they're known
in Elmina in Ghana.

00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:21.070
Long after you are long gone
from the fettered dampness,

00:14:21.070 --> 00:14:25.640
where accumulations of excrement
and other human waste remained,

00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:28.990
monuments of the
minutia of survival,

00:14:28.990 --> 00:14:33.110
where the excavator's chalk had
measured and marked the wall.

00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:36.980
The corner farthest from the
door was its highest point.

00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:39.800
There where dark flowers
stained and bloomed

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:43.070
on domed dungeon
ceilings and walls bloomed

00:14:43.070 --> 00:14:46.410
with stained blossoms in
the darkness of high noon,

00:14:46.410 --> 00:14:50.540
and blossomed at dusk with pale
blooms satining the darkness

00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:53.330
dimly and staining
the midnight hours

00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:56.980
of lightless days
with dark blossoms.

00:14:56.980 --> 00:15:00.700
There, where the
people had been,

00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:07.160
where spent heavy air had moved
slowly, overcome with sadness,

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:11.090
anguished at its own
insufficiency, there,

00:15:11.090 --> 00:15:16.120
within those walls, where
the women had waited

00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:20.750
and the men had waited and
the children who arrived who,

00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:27.100
oft times, never left, had
waited, we stood and listened

00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:29.280
to the weight of waiting.

00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:39.160
This, again, is from the second
book, "Solitary Mornings".

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:42.510
And it came actually from
thinking about the stories,

00:15:42.510 --> 00:15:44.670
memory talking with
older relatives,

00:15:44.670 --> 00:15:46.400
listening to other
people's conversations,

00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:48.700
eavesdropping sometimes
if you're riding

00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:51.340
on the bus or in a public place.

00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:53.050
And everyone has stories.

00:15:53.050 --> 00:15:55.670
You have stories about your
life, your friends' lives,

00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:59.040
what's happening,
what's not happening.

00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:02.090
And my brother, who's very
interested in folklore

00:16:02.090 --> 00:16:06.430
and anthropology, had
made a comment about some

00:16:06.430 --> 00:16:10.790
of the storytellers that
he had been in contact

00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:15.170
with from Ireland and Scotland.

00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:18.720
And he said that there -
he told about one older man

00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:23.690
who was the last one of
his generation and what

00:16:23.690 --> 00:16:26.730
that means because,
then, it's all on you.

00:16:26.730 --> 00:16:29.930
And that depends on to whom
have you told your stories.

00:16:29.930 --> 00:16:37.750
Lest the stories be lost,
silhouettes of scars and joys.

00:16:37.750 --> 00:16:40.800
Lest only one remain
conscious of the weight

00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:44.250
of things long gone, talisman

00:16:44.250 --> 00:16:47.530
against the chill of
solitary mornings.

00:16:47.530 --> 00:16:50.500
Fragility is forbidden.

00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:53.900
Now there is really no return.

00:16:55.090 --> 00:17:00.560
&gt;&gt; Michael Platt: This image
here was, again, it's 40 by 60,

00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:04.430
is one of few images where
I did what I really started

00:17:04.430 --> 00:17:07.950
out to do was to
combine the digital

00:17:07.950 --> 00:17:10.140
with traditional printmaking.

00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:12.770
So, this is etching
in a digital piece.

00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:17.380
And the idea was to do these
nice little, intricate,

00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:21.710
little etchings which for
any times I like texture,

00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:23.400
and to make it bigger.

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:25.490
Go back and work on some more.

00:17:25.490 --> 00:17:28.980
But, somewhere along the line,

00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:32.450
if it looks like a
duck, let it be a duck.

00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:33.750
You know what I mean?

00:17:33.750 --> 00:17:36.050
I really enjoyed the
digital so, why fight it?

00:17:36.050 --> 00:17:38.660
Just go ahead and
do the digital.

00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:42.600
The only thing I miss is getting
your hands dirty, you know?

00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:45.280
People ask me, "Do you do
anything traditional now?"

00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:48.360
I said, "Yes, I paint women".

00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:50.980
Because all the models,
they come over to the house,

00:17:50.980 --> 00:17:55.960
they get nude and I literally
take the paint and I paint them.

00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:57.330
So, I'm still having
fun [laughter].

00:17:57.330 --> 00:18:06.060
I'm still getting my
hands a little bit dirty.

00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:12.190
"Abandoned Spaces", I like to
title because I like grunge.

00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:17.000
I like shooting old places where
it looked like something used

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.750
to go on here and there's
a little bit of life left.

00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:22.300
If you're ever in Philadelphia,

00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:24.190
what is that, Eastern
State Prison?

00:18:24.190 --> 00:18:25.490
&gt;&gt; Carol Beane: Penitentiary.

00:18:25.490 --> 00:18:26.790
&gt;&gt; Michael Platt: Eastern
State Penitentiary.

00:18:26.790 --> 00:18:32.100
Go there. I mean, it's -
it's - I can't tell you.

00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:34.020
When you stand on
the outside, you say,

00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:36.200
"What the hell is that?"

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:37.920
I don't want to go in there.

00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:40.090
But it's a prison,
it's big, dark.

00:18:40.090 --> 00:18:41.960
As big as a whole block.

00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:44.510
And each cell is about -- .

00:18:44.510 --> 00:18:45.810
&gt;&gt; Carol Beane: -- Six by nine.

00:18:45.810 --> 00:18:47.110
&gt;&gt; Michael Platt: Six by nine.

00:18:47.110 --> 00:18:48.410
There's only one light.

00:18:48.410 --> 00:18:50.650
And they call it the Guard's
Eye and it's a skylight.

00:18:50.650 --> 00:18:53.810
And it's hard to come out of
there with a bad photograph

00:18:53.810 --> 00:18:55.520
because you've got
one light source.

00:18:55.520 --> 00:19:01.060
And inside the place, they used
it all the way up to 1970s,

00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:03.060
and it's gotten dilapidated.

00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:07.160
And trees start growing inside
the cells and everything

00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:09.240
so it's perfect for me.

00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:12.470
I shot it with the attitude
I'm going to put something

00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:16.140
in there digitally because I
like over raggedy buildings.

00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:19.500
And I know, whenever I
shoot, I shoot textures

00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:20.920
because I know I'm
going to put the texture

00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:22.780
on something or in something.

00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:25.980
If I shoot a space, I know
I'm going to put something

00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:29.660
in the space, you know.

00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:32.250
And the something is
usually these models.

00:19:32.250 --> 00:19:34.830
And the models will come
over to the house, they say,

00:19:34.830 --> 00:19:37.030
"What are we doing
today, Platt?"

00:19:37.030 --> 00:19:38.600
I don't know sometimes,
we're jumping today.

00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:40.220
So, how your knee?

00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:41.690
What you talking
about, how my knee?

00:19:41.690 --> 00:19:43.650
You know, so they
could be doing a lot

00:19:43.650 --> 00:19:45.320
of jumping up and down today.

00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:51.210
And then, eventually, I found a
place for that - for them to be.

00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:53.250
You want to talk about this one?

00:19:53.250 --> 00:19:55.760
&gt;&gt; Carol Beane: This particular
image that is there is -

00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:59.660
was taken at Father Divine's
Hotel, the Divine Lorraine

00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:02.240
which was probably one of the
first integrated hotels is

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:05.290
in Philadelphia in
the late '40s.

00:20:05.290 --> 00:20:11.250
it was being, it had - it
went downhill and ended

00:20:11.250 --> 00:20:13.200
up being not quite demolished,

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:14.880
but it was supposed
to be developed.

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:19.170
But then the - that particular
developer ran out of money,

00:20:19.170 --> 00:20:22.110
and a friend of ours got
the salvage contract.

00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:24.090
So, this is a 14-story building.

00:20:24.090 --> 00:20:29.160
It had one-inch marble
steps on the men's wing

00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:33.570
and the women's wing, but all
the way up to the 14th floor.

00:20:33.570 --> 00:20:38.620
And all of the rooms, you
know, which you could see,

00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:41.120
had old windows in it.

00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:43.740
Sometimes, the beds and what
have you would then have been

00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:45.040
left in it.

00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:46.520
So, it was very stirring,
you know,

00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:48.110
and you really felt
- felt a presence.

00:20:48.110 --> 00:20:49.410
We decided not to
do the basement.

00:20:49.410 --> 00:20:52.530
&gt;&gt; Michael Platt: No, we're
not going down in the basement.

00:20:52.530 --> 00:20:55.130
&gt;&gt; Carol Beane: Basement,
basement was too scary.

00:20:55.130 --> 00:21:01.250
You see, let me find this one.

00:21:01.250 --> 00:21:04.840
Who comes quietly there?

00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:10.490
There, where some have stood or
even waited these long years.

00:21:10.490 --> 00:21:15.230
Where light must be will
itself to enter, vain dreams

00:21:15.230 --> 00:21:18.370
and structures imbued
with tainted visions

00:21:18.370 --> 00:21:22.070
that have not left,
nor will they ever.

00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:28.150
They curl into fine
shreds tinged with regret

00:21:28.150 --> 00:21:31.670
and the lost knowledge
of who you are.

00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:36.360
This one, before
Michael changes it,

00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:41.250
you when you see the actual book
we decided, we printed it out,

00:21:41.250 --> 00:21:45.860
duplicate images and then did
some hand embellishments on it.

00:21:45.860 --> 00:21:51.990
So, that, to me, really
gave an extra oomph to the -

00:21:51.990 --> 00:21:59.930
both to the images
and to the words.

00:21:59.930 --> 00:22:02.340
Again, the same - from
the same structure,

00:22:02.340 --> 00:22:04.990
the old abandoned hotel.

00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:06.630
I don't know, at some times,

00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:08.990
I get my inspiration,
I go for a walk.

00:22:08.990 --> 00:22:10.650
And it could be a word,
it could be a phrase,

00:22:10.650 --> 00:22:12.940
could be something I
see and just the rhythm

00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:16.520
of my steps has it repeating
in my head and then I,

00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:19.100
if it feels like a really good
one, I try to write it down,

00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:22.420
remember it and then write
it down when I go home.

00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:24.280
And this - first line
of this one was one

00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:26.800
of those such occasions.

00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:30.620
She was dressed in the
many years of her existence

00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:33.510
and wore rainbows
round her head.

00:22:33.510 --> 00:22:38.140
She was adorned in
memories spattered with mud.

00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:41.420
You could not read all
of where she'd been.

00:22:41.420 --> 00:22:45.970
And tatters of her loves
clung to her restlessly.

00:22:45.970 --> 00:22:49.970
That particular image,
I think, was inspired

00:22:49.970 --> 00:22:52.890
by a woman whom I think
probably a homeless woman,

00:22:52.890 --> 00:22:54.380
a woman on the way
to her shelter

00:22:54.380 --> 00:22:57.160
or between different
points in her lives but come

00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:59.820
down on her luck, that
I passed one morning

00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:02.340
as I was going to school.

00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:06.710
And she had this air, very
proud air still about her,

00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:10.230
but she had her bags
and her layers of things

00:23:10.230 --> 00:23:17.470
that had seen better days.

00:23:17.470 --> 00:23:18.810
&gt;&gt; Michael Platt: Trans -- .

00:23:18.810 --> 00:23:20.110
&gt;&gt; Carol Beane: -- Positions.

00:23:20.110 --> 00:23:21.410
&gt;&gt; Michael Platt: Positions.

00:23:21.410 --> 00:23:27.580
This was - we had the
opportunity to apply

00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:29.990
for a public arts grant.

00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:33.660
We didn't get it.

00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:35.510
But it was about
- everyone knows

00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:39.300
about how Foggy Bottom
Georgetown used to be black,

00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:41.420
but they don't know
the whole story.

00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:43.650
Carol, we investigated the part

00:23:43.650 --> 00:23:47.470
about George Washington
University.

00:23:47.470 --> 00:23:49.140
And all that over there used

00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:52.930
to be hardcore poor
folks, Germans and -- .

00:23:52.930 --> 00:23:54.230
&gt;&gt; Carol Beane: -- Irish.

00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:55.530
&gt;&gt; Michael Platt: Irish

00:23:55.530 --> 00:23:56.830
and black folks,
they were real poor.

00:23:56.830 --> 00:24:01.610
And we looked for some areas,
we looked for some signs,

00:24:01.610 --> 00:24:04.990
but they were just
Snow Court and -- .

00:24:04.990 --> 00:24:06.290
&gt;&gt; Carol Beane: -- Hughes Mews.

00:24:06.290 --> 00:24:08.060
&gt;&gt; Michael Platt: Hughes
Mews, we finally found them.

00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:10.670
And there are little houses
there, they're about -

00:24:10.670 --> 00:24:13.600
houses about this tall
and about that wide

00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:16.190
with no bathroom, no
- nothing in them.

00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:20.930
But they are fixed up
and gentrified right now.

00:24:20.930 --> 00:24:23.930
But you - in D.C., you
walk in these alleys,

00:24:23.930 --> 00:24:26.360
you can find little
places like that, you know,

00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:28.400
that used to have a history.

00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:34.300
And so, this is about the same
time when - not about the -

00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:38.740
the ideas of gentrification
was on my head.

00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:42.320
And it's still on my head
now, you know, because I kind

00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:47.280
of think, why does
gentrification mean white?

00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:48.580
You know what I mean?

00:24:48.580 --> 00:24:53.420
It's just - and then, when
that happens, we're fixing up,

00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:54.970
but all the flavor
in the neighborhood,

00:24:54.970 --> 00:24:58.200
the reason why you - why
you live there is gone.

00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:01.880
You know, no more
after-hour joints

00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:04.420
after all the clubs close down.

00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:10.060
No more, no more
corner stores, you know.

00:25:10.060 --> 00:25:12.080
And the liquor store was -

00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:13.500
they sold candy,
they sold everything.

00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:15.400
They cash everybody's checks.

00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:19.000
The hardware store
fixed everybody's locks

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:20.710
in the big apartment.

00:25:20.710 --> 00:25:25.560
All that stuff goes away
when we gentrify, you know.

00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:28.230
But that's not the end
of the story because,

00:25:28.230 --> 00:25:30.940
if you live long enough, we
like to - I like to say I lived

00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:35.670
through time, not stuck in time.

00:25:35.670 --> 00:25:36.970
And so, this was about,

00:25:36.970 --> 00:25:42.820
that area of George Washington
University, because we applied

00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:45.290
for the grant at
the new library.

00:25:45.290 --> 00:25:47.730
We didn't get the grant but,

00:25:47.730 --> 00:25:49.490
just to make our
presentation good,

00:25:49.490 --> 00:25:51.470
I decided to make this
book in one day [laughter].

00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:56.930
And so, I stood up all night
and it got done, you know.

00:25:56.930 --> 00:25:58.460
It was done.

00:25:58.460 --> 00:26:02.730
And I say, "Well, this
is not bad", you know?

00:26:02.730 --> 00:26:07.390
Not a bad book.

00:26:07.390 --> 00:26:09.520
&gt;&gt; Carol Beane: Again, that
book, I think, is on the tables.

00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:11.410
You can take a closer
look at it.

00:26:11.410 --> 00:26:16.710
And this particular page that
it's turned to, with the figure,

00:26:16.710 --> 00:26:22.010
so, and in the very substance of
bones broken, often unattended.

00:26:22.010 --> 00:26:27.340
Of gnarled hands and discerning
whiplashes on hunched backs.

00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:31.090
Is that image sort of
a public health thing

00:26:31.090 --> 00:26:32.770
that wasn't able to happen?

00:26:32.770 --> 00:26:35.950
It certainly wasn't happening
back in sort of 19th century

00:26:35.950 --> 00:26:37.890
and coming into the 20th.

00:26:37.890 --> 00:26:42.080
And this one figure that somehow
Michael did that really seemed

00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:47.900
to combine that, that
lack, not only of service,

00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:51.940
but just of general where
do you fit, you know,

00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:54.970
and what do you deserve to have.

00:26:54.970 --> 00:27:00.270
And the opposite page,
again, references an article

00:27:00.270 --> 00:27:02.620
that I had read about
Georgetown shortly after I came

00:27:02.620 --> 00:27:04.140
to D.C., I think, in '91.

00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:07.120
So, it was probably mid '90s
in which they were talking

00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:13.310
about people in Georgetown who
were in their gardening projects

00:27:13.310 --> 00:27:16.730
and their landscaping were
turning up unexpectedly

00:27:16.730 --> 00:27:18.460
for them, because they
didn't know the history,

00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:23.340
but were turning up
bones, human remains.

00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:28.170
And that was dated back to
that time when Georgetown was,

00:27:28.170 --> 00:27:31.100
you know, an African
American community.

00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:39.150
Burials uncovered, shifting
revelations of excavations

00:27:39.150 --> 00:27:43.900
in now fine landscaped
gardens of gentile homes.

00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:53.060
Specifics of daily life,
resistance, survival,

00:27:53.060 --> 00:27:55.510
referencing and remembering
the implications

00:27:55.510 --> 00:27:58.490
of displacement and replacement.

00:27:58.490 --> 00:28:03.150
We mourn and celebrate
wood, stone, mortar,

00:28:03.150 --> 00:28:05.900
brick, steel and glass.

00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:10.090
Visions and revisions,
conjurings at our fingertips.

00:28:10.090 --> 00:28:14.870
&gt;&gt; Michael Platt:
This is one public,

00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:20.100
I think it's the
first one I ever got.

00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:24.460
We were approached by a -
what's it called the group?

00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:29.950
&gt;&gt; Carol Beane: I think the
American Association of Museums

00:28:29.950 --> 00:28:33.730
that had their annual
meeting in D.C.

00:28:33.730 --> 00:28:36.090
and the local committee
suggested to them

00:28:36.090 --> 00:28:38.450
that they might want to consider
working with some artists

00:28:38.450 --> 00:28:41.080
and having some actual
art as part of it.

00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:46.100
So, the site selected was
the Old Soldier's Home,

00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:48.530
also the site of
President Lincoln's cottage

00:28:48.530 --> 00:28:53.190
in which he supposedly, and
probably did, hopefully,

00:28:53.190 --> 00:28:56.740
write the draft of the
Emancipation Proclamation.

00:28:56.740 --> 00:29:01.250
So, it had those were two
historical, sort of, points.

00:29:01.250 --> 00:29:04.290
The one thing that we were
trying to do is we had done

00:29:04.290 --> 00:29:10.490
with the Georgetown Project
that we felt was important was

00:29:10.490 --> 00:29:14.380
to honor, bring to the fore the
African American participation

00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:16.940
in the Civil War.

00:29:16.940 --> 00:29:20.730
Down on U Street, there's
an African American museum.

00:29:20.730 --> 00:29:23.640
There's also the African
American Civil War Monument

00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:25.600
that has a lot of names.

00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:28.980
And so, all of those
figured into our creation

00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:31.130
of this particular
project which was -

00:29:31.130 --> 00:29:38.450
which were two banners 40
feet long by 48 inches high.

00:29:38.450 --> 00:29:41.890
And the challenge with
this particular project was

00:29:41.890 --> 00:29:44.410
that they had many
committees in charge

00:29:44.410 --> 00:29:45.710
of the Old Soldier's Home.

00:29:45.710 --> 00:29:49.230
There's a committee for
trees, a committee for bushes,

00:29:49.230 --> 00:29:52.060
a committee for the
buildings themselves.

00:29:52.060 --> 00:29:53.760
If the building was
a certain date,

00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:55.060
that was a different committee.

00:29:55.060 --> 00:29:59.320
So, everything was very
well tended to and minded.

00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:03.260
And there were two artists
groups, another husband

00:30:03.260 --> 00:30:06.700
and wife team also, who
collaborated, but everything had

00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:09.020
to pass through all the
committees before it could

00:30:09.020 --> 00:30:10.320
go up.

00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:12.690
So, to use nails or
not to use nails,

00:30:12.690 --> 00:30:14.290
how do you hand something
on this?

00:30:14.290 --> 00:30:17.150
And we figured everything
out, fortunately,

00:30:17.150 --> 00:30:19.630
and also with the help
of some friends of ours

00:30:19.630 --> 00:30:22.950
who are stagehands who
really knew certain tricks

00:30:22.950 --> 00:30:25.040
of the trade to, you
know, to getting it up.

00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:27.070
&gt;&gt; Michael Platt:
Martha Jackson Jarvis.

00:30:27.070 --> 00:30:29.120
&gt;&gt; Carol Beane: Yeah,
Martha Jackson Jarvis, yeah,

00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:32.160
and her daughter
and another friend,

00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:34.660
Remy and some friends
of his came.

00:30:34.660 --> 00:30:36.800
So, we all managed to get
it up and then, the next -

00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:39.970
that evening, huge rain fell.

00:30:39.970 --> 00:30:41.900
And with winds.

00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:43.830
And so, you know, you wake
up in the morning and say,

00:30:43.830 --> 00:30:47.050
"Shall I call or should we
wait for them to call us?"

00:30:47.050 --> 00:30:48.350
And they called us.

00:30:48.350 --> 00:30:53.030
And they said, "Well, you might
want to come up and look at it

00:30:53.030 --> 00:30:56.020
because something's happened,
you know, to your banner."

00:30:56.020 --> 00:30:58.250
So, we didn't know whether
something happened meant it was

00:30:58.250 --> 00:31:01.660
down, you know, it was gone
or up in the trees or what.

00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:04.830
But it was just minor damage
which we were able to fix up.

00:31:04.830 --> 00:31:09.680
But the wonderful thing about
it visually was just the company

00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:11.860
out in San Francisco
who did the work.

00:31:11.860 --> 00:31:15.640
They do banners for places
like airports and so,

00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:17.330
they know their products
very well.

00:31:17.330 --> 00:31:19.610
The fabric on which
these things are.

00:31:19.610 --> 00:31:21.660
And so, they said, "Well,
this material was used

00:31:21.660 --> 00:31:22.960
in a banner at Miami Airport".

00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:24.590
So, I said, "Okay,
we'll go with that".

00:31:24.590 --> 00:31:26.650
But the translucency
of it was something

00:31:26.650 --> 00:31:29.540
that we hadn't really
figured on.

00:31:29.540 --> 00:31:31.990
So, the day that they had
the opening reception,

00:31:31.990 --> 00:31:33.550
there was a wonderful
sunset which,

00:31:33.550 --> 00:31:36.580
in some of the photographs
you can, you know, see a few.

00:31:36.580 --> 00:31:43.560
But I did, I think, four
poems to go with that piece.

00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:45.010
&gt;&gt; Michael Platt:
Oh, wait a minute.

00:31:45.010 --> 00:31:46.690
&gt;&gt; Carol Beane: That's,
that's now the title,

00:31:46.690 --> 00:31:47.990
you've got that there.

00:31:47.990 --> 00:31:49.290
&gt;&gt; Michael Platt: Oh, yeah.

00:31:49.290 --> 00:31:50.590
&gt;&gt; Carol Beane: Okay.

00:31:50.590 --> 00:31:51.890
This is a - just a
brief statement because,

00:31:51.890 --> 00:31:55.560
as we were going back again, a
project that went from one form

00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:59.630
to the book, or to a book.

00:31:59.630 --> 00:32:03.770
I thought that the first pages
of it were a little empty,

00:32:03.770 --> 00:32:07.040
so I added this particular
phrase, turmoil

00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:12.390
and suffering seeking freedom
respite sometimes beneath

00:32:12.390 --> 00:32:14.860
a tree.

00:32:14.860 --> 00:32:18.550
And the image on the front
is actually the oldest tree

00:32:18.550 --> 00:32:20.210
on the site that
was probably there

00:32:20.210 --> 00:32:23.240
when Lincoln was doing the
Emancipation Proclamation.

00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:24.950
So, we took a picture of that

00:32:24.950 --> 00:32:28.550
and then Michael
incorporated that in the image.

00:32:28.550 --> 00:32:31.050
The image of the young
man known as a John Doe,

00:32:31.050 --> 00:32:34.140
and I think that someone has
recently done some research

00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:36.140
and they did manage
to identify him.

00:32:36.140 --> 00:32:37.440
I don't know how.

00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:40.480
One of the many people who have
worked with the collection here

00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:43.430
at the Library, [inaudible] -- ?

00:32:43.430 --> 00:32:44.730
&gt;&gt; Mark Dimunation: Yes.

00:32:44.730 --> 00:32:46.260
&gt;&gt; Carol Beane: The
Civil War Collection.

00:32:46.260 --> 00:32:50.850
One of the things
that I found out,

00:32:50.850 --> 00:32:55.170
in terms of the participation
of African Americans

00:32:55.170 --> 00:32:59.080
in the War were not only the
militia, the military people,

00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:01.180
but also the support
personnel of course,

00:33:01.180 --> 00:33:04.310
like nurses who probably
did the same job

00:33:04.310 --> 00:33:07.450
as the doctors would
have been doing nowadays,

00:33:07.450 --> 00:33:09.140
and other things.

00:33:09.140 --> 00:33:10.760
This was one Susan Taylor

00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:13.590
of whom there's an
image in the collection.

00:33:13.590 --> 00:33:15.700
And this was what,
thinking about her

00:33:15.700 --> 00:33:19.290
and what her life must have been
like, or might have been like,

00:33:19.290 --> 00:33:22.050
or could have been like then.

00:33:22.050 --> 00:33:28.000
Dawn, the stillness time
when night terrors move on

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:34.600
and healing balms and words
soothe pain and quiet fears.

00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:40.790
The coolness of dew and fever
root, the sense of dreaming.

00:33:40.790 --> 00:33:46.410
Peace bought in the early hours,
vanishing the stink of rot

00:33:46.410 --> 00:33:48.700
and the rigors of death.

00:33:48.700 --> 00:33:53.750
Compassion and life victorious
in those early morning moments

00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:55.760
of the quietude of day.

00:33:55.760 --> 00:33:57.720
&gt;&gt; Michael Platt:
Who was Miss Taylor?

00:33:57.720 --> 00:33:59.220
&gt;&gt; Carol Beane: She
was the nurse.

00:33:59.220 --> 00:34:03.020
Yeah, that's - oh, let's talk

00:34:03.020 --> 00:34:05.310
about the bottom,
Michael [inaudible].

00:34:05.310 --> 00:34:11.300
&gt;&gt; Michael Platt: Well, I
had a concept of, you know,

00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:13.700
war goes on, more people die.

00:34:13.700 --> 00:34:18.500
And we started the banner, there
was a few names at the bottom

00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:23.790
and just piled up and it just
piled up and it just piled up.

00:34:23.790 --> 00:34:33.050
But the other thing I thought
about was I'm 70, 71, you know,

00:34:33.050 --> 00:34:37.800
so, I went to school in the '50s
and '60s, grade, undergraduate.

00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:44.260
And, you know, the movies and
black and white T.V. And but,

00:34:44.260 --> 00:34:45.670
in school, the only
thing we knew

00:34:45.670 --> 00:34:48.570
about black folks was
George Washington Carver,

00:34:48.570 --> 00:34:49.870
the peanut man.

00:34:49.870 --> 00:34:51.880
And that was one paragraph.

00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:54.720
And we had the history
book about this big.

00:34:54.720 --> 00:34:56.700
But all this information
was out there,

00:34:56.700 --> 00:34:59.220
it was then not important.

00:34:59.220 --> 00:35:03.350
I don't know, what do you
mean, you're not important.

00:35:03.350 --> 00:35:06.690
But it happened, you know.

00:35:06.690 --> 00:35:08.300
The idea that somebody
would think

00:35:08.300 --> 00:35:11.590
that everything connected
you and your life and people

00:35:11.590 --> 00:35:16.900
like you, it just ain't
important, you know.

00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:18.200
&gt;&gt; Carol Beane: Yeah.

00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:21.430
&gt;&gt; Michael Platt: Yeah, you
know, but then you look at -

00:35:21.430 --> 00:35:23.480
proud of the history
of the Caribbean.

00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:26.830
Proud of the history
of Australia.

00:35:26.830 --> 00:35:30.450
Is that - it's just
not important.

00:35:30.450 --> 00:35:31.880
You know, so, the whole time,

00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:35.420
you kind of make things
important by making them big.

00:35:35.420 --> 00:35:38.050
I used to do this, before
I got into digital work,

00:35:38.050 --> 00:35:45.270
I did a drawing and paintings
about black on black crime.

00:35:45.270 --> 00:35:50.300
And my [inaudible] came,
they were about this big.

00:35:50.300 --> 00:35:53.320
You know, and they
did it that small

00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:55.530
because it just wasn't
important.

00:35:55.530 --> 00:36:00.380
So, I would do it for
[inaudible], a piece on it.

00:36:00.380 --> 00:36:04.520
But how can all this
information be out there

00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:06.090
and you can't say you
didn't know about it.

00:36:06.090 --> 00:36:09.010
It just wasn't important,
you know.

00:36:09.010 --> 00:36:10.960
&gt;&gt; Carol Beane: I think one
of the things and, you know,

00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:12.950
we're here in the Library
of Congress and you think

00:36:12.950 --> 00:36:16.790
about libraries and I was
also thinking about the people

00:36:16.790 --> 00:36:21.530
who commissioned the piece,
the Museum Association.

00:36:21.530 --> 00:36:23.030
But these are all repositories.

00:36:23.030 --> 00:36:26.820
And so, in the - you know,
that, in the warehouse somewhere

00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:29.100
in some part of these
institutions

00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:33.360
and these buildings, there are
- there is the information.

00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:37.200
You know, the data, the data is
there which is why, you know,

00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:38.990
research is so important.

00:36:38.990 --> 00:36:43.110
And people who are doing it who
come with different perspectives

00:36:43.110 --> 00:36:46.060
and different ways of thinking
about connecting the dots

00:36:46.060 --> 00:36:48.740
that they find in
places like libraries.

00:36:48.740 --> 00:36:54.670
And having access to the
bathrooms of museums, you know,

00:36:54.670 --> 00:36:58.350
is so important to
be able to work with.

00:36:58.350 --> 00:37:01.480
This was the last poem of that -

00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:07.650
in that series, "The
Last Piece".

00:37:07.650 --> 00:37:13.940
The - the figures in the
background are people who fled

00:37:13.940 --> 00:37:19.100
from the South, who had come
to the D.C. area, most of them

00:37:19.100 --> 00:37:22.190
because they had more
options, more possibilities,

00:37:22.190 --> 00:37:26.080
both to get away from
enslavement but, also,

00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:28.560
for either moving
North or participating

00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:30.710
in some form in the war.

00:37:30.710 --> 00:37:33.510
And many of the people
who are represented

00:37:33.510 --> 00:37:39.370
in the photograph collections,
I think, are called conscripts.

00:37:39.370 --> 00:37:41.880
So, they were people who
would have been freed during a

00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:45.710
particular military operation.

00:37:45.710 --> 00:37:51.360
Telling the children, you will
dance memories of feet waiting

00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:55.680
in river waters, riding with
all those cast into the sea

00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:58.110
on swells of moonlight.

00:37:58.110 --> 00:38:02.910
Following those who leapt in
waded rivers under branches

00:38:02.910 --> 00:38:08.120
of light and presence
you declare, I am.

00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:11.830
We are in the midnight
hours and at high noon,

00:38:11.830 --> 00:38:16.460
all those who died
journeying the deep waters

00:38:16.460 --> 00:38:21.480
and the dusty roads protecting
shadows and claiming rhythms

00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:24.550
of remembering in other places.

00:38:29.410 --> 00:38:33.800
And these two poems,
this is, again,

00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:37.290
a very well-known image
and, everybody who's been

00:38:37.290 --> 00:38:41.810
to the new museum over on
14th Street, will recognize it

00:38:41.810 --> 00:38:44.320
because it's one of
the key ones there.

00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:48.230
And then, the John Doe because
that was how this young man

00:38:48.230 --> 00:38:50.500
was identified.

00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:54.530
And the flag, that one
has always hope for,

00:38:54.530 --> 00:38:56.460
off to the right.

00:38:56.460 --> 00:38:59.070
These two pieces
I wrote together

00:38:59.070 --> 00:39:03.110
as a - kind of as a pair.

00:39:03.110 --> 00:39:06.770
The one on the left with the
image of John Doe thinking

00:39:06.770 --> 00:39:11.440
about the site for the exhibit.

00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:16.560
And the one on the left,
a more open statement.

00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:23.310
Place of solitude and solace,
place of sorrow and pain,

00:39:23.310 --> 00:39:26.840
of reflection and introspection.

00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:31.680
Now they cannot hear the
wind of all the trees remain.

00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:37.680
Then they would have heard the
leaf songs, heard the work songs

00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:42.540
and the sorrow songs, heard
and known the stories.

00:39:42.540 --> 00:39:46.770
We have those carried
on the winds of memory.

00:39:46.770 --> 00:39:49.570
Those set down note
by deliberate note,

00:39:49.570 --> 00:39:51.910
word by weighted word.

00:39:51.910 --> 00:39:54.530
We are the keepers of artifacts.

00:39:54.530 --> 00:39:59.550
Their voices, their visions,
the culture of given peoples,

00:39:59.550 --> 00:40:02.310
their spaces and times.

00:40:02.310 --> 00:40:08.230
The truth of being and
creating, of the imagination

00:40:08.230 --> 00:40:11.480
and the laying on of hands.

00:40:11.480 --> 00:40:15.620
We stand together, we do,
on the edge of beginning.

00:40:15.620 --> 00:40:19.440
You with your strength
of hard wood, red oak,

00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:21.720
ash and southern pine.

00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:24.680
I with the power of
waters and the wisdom

00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:27.040
of my promise reflected
in midnight skies.

00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:33.190
For the planting of seed
seasons we have come.

00:40:33.190 --> 00:40:36.170
For the raising up
seasons and the falling

00:40:36.170 --> 00:40:40.060
of the leaves seasons
and the gathering up

00:40:40.060 --> 00:40:43.820
and the laying down
of dry limbs.

00:40:43.820 --> 00:40:50.200
Under passion's roof in fields
and grasses fed with blood,

00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:54.770
under wide skies and
trees grown old and wise.

00:40:54.770 --> 00:40:58.560
Seen so much, seen too much.

00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:04.050
We stand in hope
and dream and do.

00:41:04.050 --> 00:41:09.780
We stand together in places
of solitude, sorrow and pain.

00:41:09.780 --> 00:41:14.390
And, at the edges of beginning
in the solace of reflection.

00:41:14.390 --> 00:41:18.070
We draw near in places
of solace, sharing grief

00:41:18.070 --> 00:41:22.040
and desolation, sharing faith.

00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:25.400
We know the tumult of
the edges of beginning

00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:27.810
and the silences of endings.

00:41:27.810 --> 00:41:32.430
Endings, thank you very much.

00:41:32.430 --> 00:41:33.730
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Speaker:
Is there another one?

00:41:33.730 --> 00:41:35.030
&gt;&gt; Carol Beane: Oh, yes.

00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:36.330
&gt;&gt; Michael Platt: Nope, and
that's the end [laughter].

00:41:36.330 --> 00:41:38.130
Hope you all enjoyed.

00:41:38.130 --> 00:41:45.170
[ Applause ]

00:41:45.170 --> 00:41:48.540
&gt;&gt; Michael Platt: Any questions?

00:41:48.540 --> 00:41:49.840
Any questions?

00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:51.140
Derek.

00:41:51.140 --> 00:41:52.550
&gt;&gt; Derek: Did you talk
about your inspirations

00:41:52.550 --> 00:41:55.310
and your inspirations
for images with thoughts

00:41:55.310 --> 00:41:58.110
or words or by yourselves?

00:41:58.110 --> 00:42:01.050
How is it that you then take the
- those inspirations together

00:42:01.050 --> 00:42:03.010
when you do your collaborations?

00:42:03.010 --> 00:42:05.380
What's the moment where you
talk about an aha moment

00:42:05.380 --> 00:42:08.130
when you know that an image
works with that poetry

00:42:08.130 --> 00:42:12.360
or when the poetry
works with an image?

00:42:12.360 --> 00:42:15.880
&gt;&gt; Carol Beane: I think as we
were, as we were working on it,

00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:18.660
particularly the first
book, we each had something

00:42:18.660 --> 00:42:21.160
that we - that we loved.

00:42:21.160 --> 00:42:25.580
You know, I had a phrase that I
thought was just really powerful

00:42:25.580 --> 00:42:29.590
and Michael had an image
that he was, you know,

00:42:29.590 --> 00:42:31.800
felt the same way about.

00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:35.190
And sometimes he'd say, "Do you
have any words to go with this?"

00:42:35.190 --> 00:42:36.780
You know, and I would
come and I would look

00:42:36.780 --> 00:42:39.560
and I would either come back
with something or I'd say,

00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:42.810
"Let me think about it" and then
come back with something later.

00:42:42.810 --> 00:42:46.450
And sometimes I didn't have
any for that particular image.

00:42:46.450 --> 00:42:47.970
And the same thing for him.

00:42:47.970 --> 00:42:50.940
See, I still have a couple of
things that I've got, you know,

00:42:50.940 --> 00:42:54.990
that I'd like to Michael
to do some images for.

00:42:54.990 --> 00:42:57.860
My bus phone, for
example, is one.

00:42:57.860 --> 00:43:02.260
But it's just - it was just
that it has been, so far,

00:43:02.260 --> 00:43:05.150
just been basically that simple.

00:43:05.150 --> 00:43:08.580
And it either, it
worked, it was okay.

00:43:08.580 --> 00:43:15.290
And then a couple of - couple
of poems - I wrote one poem,

00:43:15.290 --> 00:43:17.550
I was looking for something else
on the computer and I pulled

00:43:17.550 --> 00:43:20.230
up this image that
Michael had been working on

00:43:20.230 --> 00:43:22.310
and I hadn't seen it before
because we don't always,

00:43:22.310 --> 00:43:26.130
I don't always show Michael
things that I write immediately.

00:43:26.130 --> 00:43:29.190
Sometimes, it's a really
long time, like years.

00:43:29.190 --> 00:43:33.220
And he has images that
he's constantly working on

00:43:33.220 --> 00:43:35.610
or constantly changing,
so I don't always know

00:43:35.610 --> 00:43:38.920
which version it is that maybe
he's trying to respond to.

00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:40.220
And so, -- .

00:43:40.220 --> 00:43:42.230
&gt;&gt; Michael Platt: -- Also -- .

00:43:42.230 --> 00:43:43.910
&gt;&gt; Carol Beane: -- I
looked at it and this -

00:43:43.910 --> 00:43:46.430
the poem just came out.

00:43:46.430 --> 00:43:49.840
And then, afterwards, he told
me that it was a poem written

00:43:49.840 --> 00:43:54.040
about a - it had been an
asylum for African American

00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:57.110
who were considered
mentally ill in Patapsco.

00:43:57.110 --> 00:44:02.000
It's called, you know,
"The Day We Were Set Free".

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:05.710
And I had no idea of knowing
that, but that's what it looked

00:44:05.710 --> 00:44:09.120
like and it felt to me, so.

00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:12.840
&gt;&gt; Carol Beane: I don't know
too many poets, but I got to -

00:44:12.840 --> 00:44:17.630
I was introduced to
poets, Charles Blackwell

00:44:17.630 --> 00:44:23.090
and Kenny Carroll and
The Wild Man, Gaston Neal

00:44:23.090 --> 00:44:26.110
and he was the one
that really got Carol

00:44:26.110 --> 00:44:29.610
out of the closet,
you know [laughter].

00:44:29.610 --> 00:44:33.060
Don't do that nice stuff, come
on, you can give me some edge,

00:44:33.060 --> 00:44:34.360
you know, that was Gaston.

00:44:34.360 --> 00:44:36.760
But all the poets I know, they
had this big, raggedy book.

00:44:36.760 --> 00:44:39.850
There's pages falling
all out, you know, they -

00:44:39.850 --> 00:44:42.870
Carol would go upstairs,
this is before we got heavy

00:44:42.870 --> 00:44:44.570
into the computer.

00:44:44.570 --> 00:44:47.090
She'd go upstairs and
come back with this book.

00:44:47.090 --> 00:44:50.570
And - I got something in here,
oh, it's in here somewhere.

00:44:50.570 --> 00:44:54.730
But the deal is you always got
- you always have got to work.

00:44:54.730 --> 00:44:56.640
You can't wait.

00:44:56.640 --> 00:44:57.940
You've got to work.

00:44:57.940 --> 00:45:03.640
I decided quite a few years ago,
you've got 20 minutes a day.

00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:05.830
You do one thing
20 minutes a day,

00:45:05.830 --> 00:45:07.640
you're going to get good at it.

00:45:07.640 --> 00:45:10.750
You know, even exercise which I
haven't been doing [laughter] 20

00:45:10.750 --> 00:45:12.050
minutes a day.

00:45:12.050 --> 00:45:13.350
So, you - but we
always have something

00:45:13.350 --> 00:45:15.880
to work from, not to work for.

00:45:15.880 --> 00:45:17.200
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Speaker:
Will any of the things

00:45:17.200 --> 00:45:24.980
in the basement, which I'm going
to take a closer look at now,

00:45:24.980 --> 00:45:27.300
ever get resurrected
or reconfigured?

00:45:27.300 --> 00:45:30.890
&gt;&gt; Michael Platt: Yeah, because,
you know, the other thing about,

00:45:30.890 --> 00:45:33.660
not necessarily true with
drawing and painting,

00:45:33.660 --> 00:45:36.430
but with printmaking
and digital print,

00:45:36.430 --> 00:45:38.090
you've got prints
that don't work.

00:45:38.090 --> 00:45:41.240
And you don't want
to throw them away

00:45:41.240 --> 00:45:43.680
because you know damn well
you're going to cut that sucker

00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:45.050
up and make a [inaudible].

00:45:45.050 --> 00:45:49.130
But you never quite
seem to get to that

00:45:49.130 --> 00:45:52.490
because you're still thinking
about the new image, you know.

00:45:52.490 --> 00:45:55.090
And sometimes, when you
work on an old image, you -

00:45:55.090 --> 00:45:58.340
your brain goes back
to that old time again.

00:45:58.340 --> 00:46:02.010
I don't know how
to get past that.

00:46:02.010 --> 00:46:04.110
What's the fellow
in New Orleans?

00:46:04.110 --> 00:46:05.410
John Scott?

00:46:05.410 --> 00:46:10.600
He was the only dude I've seen
that took a bunch of old prints

00:46:10.600 --> 00:46:13.970
that didn't work, cut them up
and do collages out of them.

00:46:13.970 --> 00:46:15.270
And it worked.

00:46:15.270 --> 00:46:17.800
All printmakers think
about doing that, you know,

00:46:17.800 --> 00:46:20.150
because that's why they don't
throw away nothing [laughter].

00:46:20.150 --> 00:46:24.020
E.J., you don't throw
away anything [laughter].

00:46:24.020 --> 00:46:26.420
You know, because it's going
to happen one day, you know,

00:46:26.420 --> 00:46:28.760
we're going to -
it's going to happen.

00:46:28.760 --> 00:46:30.730
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Speaker:
Just reprint on top of it.

00:46:30.730 --> 00:46:32.830
&gt;&gt; Michael Platt: Well, we're
going to - we're going to deal

00:46:32.830 --> 00:46:34.130
with those old things.

00:46:34.130 --> 00:46:37.050
I don't know how we're going
to deal with it, you know,

00:46:37.050 --> 00:46:38.840
maybe the canvas
we're going to work

00:46:38.840 --> 00:46:40.890
on would be the size
of that wall.

00:46:40.890 --> 00:46:44.370
You know, and play Romare
Bearden and just cut

00:46:44.370 --> 00:46:53.580
that sucker out, put it up there
and see what happens, you know.

00:46:53.580 --> 00:46:55.900
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Speaker:
And put it back

00:46:55.900 --> 00:46:58.330
in the printer, print it again.

00:46:58.330 --> 00:46:59.630
&gt;&gt; Michael Platt: Yes,
Mr. Green [laughter].

00:46:59.630 --> 00:47:00.930
That's what we good for.

00:47:00.930 --> 00:47:02.230
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Speaker:
I was curious

00:47:02.230 --> 00:47:03.530
about the portfolio
on the table.

00:47:03.530 --> 00:47:05.980
Have you done several
portfolios?

00:47:05.980 --> 00:47:10.600
And were they done at the
same time as the books?

00:47:10.600 --> 00:47:15.180
&gt;&gt; Michael Platt:
Portfolios, again,

00:47:15.180 --> 00:47:18.130
not all portfolios had words
on them - have words on them.

00:47:18.130 --> 00:47:22.000
This portfolio, here, was
a direct response to the -

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:25.630
a trip to Ghana when
I saw those castles,

00:47:25.630 --> 00:47:27.660
slave castles I call them.

00:47:27.660 --> 00:47:30.610
And I shot one for two hours.

00:47:30.610 --> 00:47:34.140
But, to me, they were just
stage sets and textures

00:47:34.140 --> 00:47:37.390
and I just knew I'm
going to jump

00:47:37.390 --> 00:47:40.520
on this soon as I get back home.

00:47:40.520 --> 00:47:43.340
The portfolios with
that printmaking thing

00:47:43.340 --> 00:47:46.880
of small pieces or
people with little money.

00:47:46.880 --> 00:47:52.170
I always had this thing with
making my work accessible.

00:47:52.170 --> 00:47:56.280
So, I would do a portfolio
of small eight by -- .

00:47:56.280 --> 00:47:57.580
&gt;&gt; Carol Beane: -- Tens.

00:47:57.580 --> 00:48:00.140
&gt;&gt; Michael Platt: Eight by
tens for a lot of the shows.

00:48:00.140 --> 00:48:03.910
And I'd put them together.

00:48:03.910 --> 00:48:09.170
And that's how, you know, that
- I never quite got it together

00:48:09.170 --> 00:48:11.590
about how to make
money in art, you know.

00:48:11.590 --> 00:48:13.070
That's why I taught school.

00:48:13.070 --> 00:48:14.690
That's why most people I know

00:48:14.690 --> 00:48:16.070
who are artists,
they teach school.

00:48:16.070 --> 00:48:19.380
I think that some of
us are fortunate enough

00:48:19.380 --> 00:48:21.940
to make a living out of this.

00:48:21.940 --> 00:48:23.660
Because we weren't - at
our age, we weren't taught.

00:48:23.660 --> 00:48:27.950
It was just through osmosis,
you'd get out there and you go

00:48:27.950 --> 00:48:29.250
into that gallery over there.

00:48:29.250 --> 00:48:30.550
They tell you, "No".

00:48:30.550 --> 00:48:32.130
Then you go to the next
gallery, they tell you, "No".

00:48:32.130 --> 00:48:35.470
You do that for about two years,
maybe somebody might say, "Yes".

00:48:35.470 --> 00:48:38.510
They see you coming in the
door with that big portfolio,

00:48:38.510 --> 00:48:40.160
they know, [sniffing] student.

00:48:40.160 --> 00:48:43.180
Come back, come back later,
two years, [laughter] you know.

00:48:43.180 --> 00:48:45.100
And you don't get discouraged,
you just keep going.

00:48:45.100 --> 00:48:48.250
But, today, they a little
bit more on the game of how

00:48:48.250 --> 00:48:49.890
to make a living out of this.

00:48:49.890 --> 00:48:54.590
And, thanks to computers,
YouTube - I call it YouTubeU,

00:48:54.590 --> 00:48:58.400
you can learn everything
on YouTube right now.

00:48:58.400 --> 00:49:01.010
You can - just so much
information out here right now

00:49:01.010 --> 00:49:03.340
that wasn't out there
when I was, you know.

00:49:03.340 --> 00:49:04.640
&gt;&gt; Carol Beane: You
had a question?

00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:05.940
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Speaker: Yeah.

00:49:05.940 --> 00:49:07.450
I was interested in
how much of your work

00:49:07.450 --> 00:49:10.140
or [inaudible] combination,
how much of it is based

00:49:10.140 --> 00:49:13.760
on historical events and
places that you visited

00:49:13.760 --> 00:49:18.610
such as the slave castles
you called them in Ghana.

00:49:18.610 --> 00:49:24.050
And how much is it based on
like the day-to-day observations

00:49:24.050 --> 00:49:27.450
like you were mentioning this
woman that you saw walking?

00:49:27.450 --> 00:49:33.980
Is it like 50/50 or do you find
that you're more [inaudible]

00:49:33.980 --> 00:49:37.450
to historical aspects of
the work that you would do

00:49:37.450 --> 00:49:38.750
or that you base
your work off of?

00:49:38.750 --> 00:49:40.390
&gt;&gt; Michael Platt: A lot
of times, my work is based

00:49:40.390 --> 00:49:43.900
on where I'm going
to where I travel to.

00:49:43.900 --> 00:49:47.530
And, usually, through these
African what's the conferences?

00:49:47.530 --> 00:49:48.830
&gt;&gt; Carol Beane: Literature
Association.

00:49:48.830 --> 00:49:50.210
&gt;&gt; Michael Platt: African
Literature Association,

00:49:50.210 --> 00:49:52.710
had something to do
with black folks.

00:49:52.710 --> 00:49:55.140
I always - I always ask her,
"Take me, take me, take me".

00:49:55.140 --> 00:49:56.860
You know, I'd find
something to do.

00:49:56.860 --> 00:49:58.160
&gt;&gt; Carol Beane: No,
that - that - wait, no,

00:49:58.160 --> 00:50:00.500
that happened because, those
of you who may be printmakers,

00:50:00.500 --> 00:50:04.060
there's a Southern Graphics
Printmaking Conference is one

00:50:04.060 --> 00:50:05.360
that Michael used to go to.

00:50:05.360 --> 00:50:08.450
He would see [inaudible] there
and, you know, other folks.

00:50:08.450 --> 00:50:11.590
And there would be this product
fair and Michael would come back

00:50:11.590 --> 00:50:13.910
and he'd always be - he would
always have such a good time.

00:50:13.910 --> 00:50:15.540
So, I said, "I need to
go to one of those".

00:50:15.540 --> 00:50:17.840
So, I went to one of those
and then we began, you know,

00:50:17.840 --> 00:50:22.700
exchanging so that -
that worked out well.

00:50:22.700 --> 00:50:24.000
Sylvia.

00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:27.710
&gt;&gt; Sylvia: So, are - have you
written a book about yourselves,

00:50:27.710 --> 00:50:29.380
or just documented you?

00:50:29.380 --> 00:50:33.110
Because, you know, while you're
alive and you have your memory.

00:50:33.110 --> 00:50:34.410
&gt;&gt; Michael Platt:
That's very good.

00:50:34.410 --> 00:50:36.900
I like that [laughter].

00:50:36.900 --> 00:50:38.200
&gt;&gt; Carol Beane: We've, you know,

00:50:38.200 --> 00:50:41.150
Michael has his show that's
upcoming at the [inaudible]

00:50:41.150 --> 00:50:42.540
for which he'll be a catalog.

00:50:42.540 --> 00:50:44.970
And we had talked a number of
years, a couple - maybe two

00:50:44.970 --> 00:50:48.940
or three years ago about doing
a book about Michael, doing it.

00:50:48.940 --> 00:50:53.180
So, we've got - but, about the
two of us, I guess, you know,

00:50:53.180 --> 00:50:55.300
I used to never tell
anybody that I was a poet.

00:50:55.300 --> 00:50:59.270
I used to not tell anybody
that I wrote poetry.

00:50:59.270 --> 00:51:02.270
I had a - the people
I learned Portuguese

00:51:02.270 --> 00:51:05.720
from had a very good poet
friends, they're both academics.

00:51:05.720 --> 00:51:10.410
And they work in Brazilian
literature and they told one

00:51:10.410 --> 00:51:12.650
of their friends, who
was a poet in Brazil,

00:51:12.650 --> 00:51:15.450
about their friend,
me, who wrote poetry.

00:51:15.450 --> 00:51:16.990
So, I would send
some things down so,

00:51:16.990 --> 00:51:18.680
sometimes I would get very
daring and I would try

00:51:18.680 --> 00:51:20.870
to write poetry - well,
I wouldn't write it

00:51:20.870 --> 00:51:22.790
in Spanish, but Portuguese.

00:51:22.790 --> 00:51:26.770
And so, I would always call
them poemoids, you know,

00:51:26.770 --> 00:51:30.790
I couldn't bring myself to,
you know, take ownership.

00:51:30.790 --> 00:51:33.740
But, again, Michael and
our friend, Gaston Neal,

00:51:33.740 --> 00:51:37.090
were the two people who,
you know, put the rope

00:51:37.090 --> 00:51:42.010
around my wrist or whatever part
of me and sort of dragged me

00:51:42.010 --> 00:51:45.180
to read, you know, before
more than one person.

00:51:45.180 --> 00:51:51.060
And, you know, I'm very grateful
for that and all the friends

00:51:51.060 --> 00:51:54.720
who have listened to
me, you know, over,

00:51:54.720 --> 00:51:56.020
you know, over the years.

00:51:56.020 --> 00:51:58.760
And [inaudible] Christina
Wasserman is one

00:51:58.760 --> 00:52:01.100
and Juliet Bethea [phonetic]
and sometimes at the gallery

00:52:01.100 --> 00:52:03.400
that represented Michael,
if he would present some

00:52:03.400 --> 00:52:05.150
of these pieces like these,

00:52:05.150 --> 00:52:09.530
the portfolio's pieces
were like four by six.

00:52:09.530 --> 00:52:12.120
And so, he exhibited all
of those in the gallery

00:52:12.120 --> 00:52:14.910
and I read the poems
that went with them.

00:52:14.910 --> 00:52:18.350
And, after a while, you begin
to say, "Yes, this is something

00:52:18.350 --> 00:52:19.790
that I do, you know, that's me".

00:52:19.790 --> 00:52:21.090
So.

00:52:21.090 --> 00:52:22.790
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Speaker: But
I mean, like, in terms of -- .

00:52:22.790 --> 00:52:25.440
&gt;&gt; Carol Beane: -- But in
terms of ongoing documentation

00:52:25.440 --> 00:52:27.860
and both by what
you did with E.J.,

00:52:27.860 --> 00:52:34.710
example, and other people -- .

00:52:34.710 --> 00:52:42.090
&gt;&gt; Unidentified: -- Because -
well, what I mean, in terms of,

00:52:42.090 --> 00:52:43.480
you know, setting a model

00:52:43.480 --> 00:52:48.340
for African American young
artists because, you know,

00:52:48.340 --> 00:52:52.030
you're always looking at
other people's stories.

00:52:52.030 --> 00:52:55.650
And it would be a great read.

00:52:55.650 --> 00:52:57.860
Like, you know.

00:52:57.860 --> 00:52:59.160
&gt;&gt; Michael Platt: That's
something to think about.

00:52:59.160 --> 00:53:00.460
&gt;&gt; Carol Beane: Yeah.

00:53:00.460 --> 00:53:01.760
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Speaker:
They are open to it,

00:53:01.760 --> 00:53:03.060
but they need someone
to pen it for them.

00:53:03.060 --> 00:53:04.360
&gt;&gt; Carol Beane: Yeah.

00:53:04.360 --> 00:53:05.660
Well, yeah.

00:53:05.660 --> 00:53:06.960
And my friend and
former student,

00:53:06.960 --> 00:53:08.260
my son by another mother, from -

00:53:08.260 --> 00:53:09.560
who I've known really
a long time,

00:53:09.560 --> 00:53:10.860
one of my students way back
when when I was teaching

00:53:10.860 --> 00:53:12.160
at Bryn Mawr, has been after
me to do something like that.

00:53:12.160 --> 00:53:13.460
In fact, we have kind
of a joint project set.
