00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:05.488
You think you'll stick with folk rock or are you going on into more writing? I don't play folk Rock

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:08.220
What would you call your music?

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:10.559
I'd call it

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:16.949
There must be some way out of here

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:20.450
Said the Joker to the thief

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.889
There's too much confusion

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.160
I can't get no relief

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:37.040
So there are some novels some trilogies in fact with less actual content than Bob Dylan's ”All along the watchtower”

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.669
it's really astonishing what Dylan achieves in 12 lines

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.489
130 words and two and a half minutes. I don't think I can explain the song definitively

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:48.499
I don't think anyone could do that with Dylan

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:54.529
But there's a lot here to explore. And the first thing to note is exactly when and where all along the watchtower

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.489
fits in Dylan's career, the song is the fourth on his

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.199
1967 album, John Wesley Harding coming after two of his most famous and most

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:09.829
Celebrated records Highway 61 Revisited and Blonde on Blonde Dylan had already gone electric already

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.879
repudiated much of the political significance he had in his first years and

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:20.810
alienated a lot of his folk music following in the process His lyrics in those albums were lyrics of a man

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:25.369
possessed shot through with some magic spirit singing gorgeously beautiful

00:01:25.709 --> 00:01:32.239
Epics in a stream of illusions and vignettes for this reason John Wesley harding can only come as a shock

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.280
It's totally spare

00:01:34.349 --> 00:01:35.429
instrumentation mostly

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:40.999
guitar bass and drums under vocals and Harmonica and largely two to three-minute songs strike a

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:46.669
Bold contrast not only to his previous albums, but to the maximalist psychedelic feeling of

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:55.069
1967 the same year that the Beatles released sergeant Pepper's lonely Hearts club band which by the way Dylan called quote very indulgent

00:01:55.459 --> 00:02:01.669
Despite this Dylan's eighth album was universally praised and rightly, so it's among the tightest work

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.440
he's ever released both conceptually than the themes found in the 12 song cycle and

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:13.279
Lyrically, there's no line that you can stick your finger through. He said in 1968. There's no hole in any of the stanzas

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:20.989
there's no blank filler each line has something in all along the watchtower there are exactly twelve lines a parable framed as a

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:28.789
Conversation between two archetypes a joker and a thief the joker speaks first looking for a way [out] of here though

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.530
We don't quite know where here is

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:37.730
Then complaining that businessmen drink his wine plowman dig his earth while neither of them know what those things are worth the thief

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.079
Responds saying that there's no reason to get excited those people may feel that life is a joke

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.779
But we know better because we've been through that already

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:50.150
the story then pulls back to a watchtower where there is some kind of commotion as

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:54.139
Watchmen notice two Riders approaching in the cold distance

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.779
The final quatrain is a little bit jarring. It's almost as if it's misplaced in time

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.990
It's been suggested in fact that the last lines are actually

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:09.470
Chronologically the first in the story and by doing this dylan gives the song a kind of endless

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.400
Circular feel the story always rapping around to the start again

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.200
Emphasizing just how futile the Joker's first comment is

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.609
there must be some way out of here

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:21.380
of course

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:24.439
It's unclear whether the two riders spotted from the watchtower

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:29.119
are the Joker and the thief or whether the joker and the thief spot them or some other configuration

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:34.100
And for that matter it's worth questioning who exactly these two figures are

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.860
some think that the Joker is Dylan while the thief is

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.150
Elvis who stole

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.400
African-American music for white pop culture.

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:46.220
Others see the two figures as two sides of Dylan's own personality before and after the horrible

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.830
motorcycle accident that in many ways

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.640
Generated this new style of music

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:55.700
still others see the joker as jesus in conversation with one of the thieves that was crucified

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:57.950
Alongside him

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.800
Making biblical connections, isn't that far-fetched?

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:07.339
There are some 70 biblical allusions in John Wesley harding all told and those close to Dylan remember him repeatedly

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.840
Consulting a large version of the King James Bible at his home in Woodstock

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:18.440
Several people have noted the similarities between this song and a passage from the book of ISaiah Chapter 21 to be exact

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:24.979
It's a passage that prophesies the fall of babylon and the jews return from exile to Jerusalem

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:29.270
Dylan spent much of his early career fighting off the label of prophet

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:34.339
It's a responsibility he felt was thrust on him ilegitimately, but here

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.700
He seems to accept the role laying down an apprehensive

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:45.049
Apocalyptic scenario as if to say ”You want a prophecy? Okay? I'll give you a prophecy”, but it comes at a price the price is

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:50.660
Mistery and Entrapment a prophecy the meaning of which is forever out of reach

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:58.070
He casts himself in the role of Joker, thief, narrator, Jesus and prophet all simultaneously

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:06.349
Removing any anchoring personal presence like you might find in his previous work by the end the audience is left in as much

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:12.829
Fearful anticipation of what's to come as the reader of yates's second coming as a great beast?

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:15.350
impossible to fathom slouches toward Bethlehem

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:17.010
to be born

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:20.029
Where this gets really compelling for me though is in the actual music

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:26.479
a lot of people prefer Jimi Hendrix's version of this song and obviously it's incredibly fantastic

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.619
but for me the Sonic quality of Dylan's original

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:36.560
fits perfectly with this narrative at the heart of the song is a driving guitar and bass chord progression which

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:43.969
Once it's repeated a few dozen times locks you into a hypnotic momentum. onto this is added Dylan's call-and-response lyrics

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:51.020
with each line comprising two parts that swing pendulum-like back and forth in his singing

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:56.149
never varying outside of a narrow lane of pitch more overtones of

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:02.930
being trapped the high-pitched relentlessness of the harmonica interludes just fray the nerves adding to the sense of

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:06.440
apprehension and foreboding that the song is trying to create in us

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.000
All along the Watchtower

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:12.340
princes kept the view

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:17.259
Dylan is conversing here with two of his favorite musical Genres

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:25.090
The song is technically a folk ballad albeit a short one. It's a story told as a conversation that Aims to Convey a message

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:28.330
but the fingerprints of the blues are

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:35.080
Everywhere on the song namely one of Dylan's Heroes Robert Johnson who the legend has it sold his soul to the devil

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:37.600
for musical genius

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:50.680
like Dylan Johnson told evocative stories with dark undertones on songs with simple repetitive structures

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:55.359
Think that's the key to the power of this song all along the watchtower

00:06:55.850 --> 00:07:00.549
delivers its prophecy of impending doom on to a steady and

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:06.700
unfaltering foundation something that points backward to both his roots in folk and

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:09.009
to the black roots of Rock and roll

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:14.649
it was Bob Dylan's great gift that he could take something that orient's itself toward the past and

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:17.410
push himself and his music forward

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:21.399
It's the music that makes all along the watchtower a cryptic

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:27.549
Prophecy that you can't escape something that teases you in and always at the end

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:29.390
begins

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:31.839
There must be some [way] out of here

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:35.180
Sidda [Joga] [Jealousy]

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:42.709
Is too much hey everybody thanks for watching [I] had so much fun making this video such a blast to edit if you guys want
