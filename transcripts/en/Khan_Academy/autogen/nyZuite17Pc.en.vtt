00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.320
 . 

00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.890
 In this presentation, we will learn how to take the distance 

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:08.640
 Between any two points on the axes x and y, and 

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.060
 We'll see, it's just an application 

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:12.780
 Pythagoras 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.040
 Let's start with an example 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.070
 Let's assume I have the point, I'll write it in dark 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:17.950
 So we can see it on the graph sheet 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:22.070
 Let's assume that I have a pinch 3, -4 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.180
 If I wanted to represent her, I would go 1, 2, 3 and 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:26.480
 I will move to 4 at the bottom 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:33.440
 1, 2, 3, 4 Here, these are 3, -4 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:40.110
 Suppose also that I have point 6.0 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.660
 If 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, then there is no movement in 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:46.310
 Direction y 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:47.610
 We take a position only on the x-axis 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.086
 Axis y = 0, this is the point 6,0 

00:00:52.086 --> 00:00:55.810
 What I want to find is the distance between these two 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:56.410
 Two points 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.350
 How much after this blue dot about this orange point? 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:01.910
 First, I do not think we are 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:03.570
 We have already seen how to find 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:04.440
 Such a distance 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.290
 What were you talking about Pythagorean theory? 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.180
 I do not see triangles here! 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:09.690
 If you do not see a triangle, let me 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:10.940
 I draw it for you 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.770
 I will draw a triangle 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.060
 Let me draw this triangle here, so 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.690
 Let me use several colors 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.090
 Share the point completely 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:24.650
 If this is the triangle 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:25.990
 Perhaps you will realize quickly 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:27.950
 This is a triangle 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:29.810
 This is our existing triangle 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.520
 Its base is moving straight from left to right, and the right side is heading 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.710
 Straight from top to bottom, we are dealing with an existing triangle 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.210
 If we can find the length of the base and 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.350
 In this case, we can even use Pythagoras' theorem 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.690
 We find the long rib, the opposite rib 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:49.700
 For the right angle, ie the tendon 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:55.890
 This distance is a tendon 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.180
 Triangle based 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.180
 Let me write this down 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:04.050
 This distance is equal to the tendon 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:05.660
 This triangle exists 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:07.480
 Let me paint it more 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:10.710
 If this is the chord 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:14.880
 Then we have the right rib, the rib that moves 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.070
 From top to bottom 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.500
 Then we have the rule 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:19.860
 Now, how can we find - call me 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.550
 My name is this d relative to the distance 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.540
 This is the length of the tendon 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.640
 How to find the length of the descent from top to bottom 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.270
 This rib? 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.940
 Let's look at the rule first, how much is this distance? 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.010
 You can count them on this graph sheet, but here 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.150
 Where x = - let me use the green color 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.530
 Here, we point to x = 3, here on x = 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:42.800
 6, right? 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.550
 We move straight to the right 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.570
 This is the same distance there 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:49.910
 So we find that distance, ie 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:50.710
 End of point x 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:52.240
 You can move in the other direction, because you 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:53.770
 You will rip everything up, it does not matter if you get it 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:59.230
 Negative numbers, if the distance here equals 6 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.360
 -3, is not it? 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.680
 6, -3 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.520
 This distance, which is equal to 3 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.140
 If we have created the rule 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.610
 To remind ourselves, this is equal 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:14.200
 To change the x 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.100
 This was equal to the final x point - 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.890
 Starting point 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.020
 63 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:21.860
 This is delta x 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:25.990
 Now, following the same line of reasoning, rise 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:29.640
 Here is the change in y 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.290
 Above we will be at y = 0 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:32.670
 Perhaps this is the end point 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:34.360
 It's the top point on y 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.900
 Here, we will be y = -4 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.460
 Change in y = 0-4 

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:44.930
 All I do is take a higher value for y - less 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.810
 The value for y, the highest value for x - the lowest value for x 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:49.870
 But we will see that we will square them 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:51.830
 Quickly, even if you do it in another way, you'll 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:53.410
 You get a negative number, but you'll still get the same 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:56.030
 Answer, if this equals 4 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:57.890
 This rib equals 4 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:00.370
 You can also count on the graph sheet if you like 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.310
 This rib equals 3 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:07.040
 Now we can use the theory of Pythagoras 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.730
 This distance is a square distance 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:12.400
 be cerfull 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.270
 Space box = delta x ^ 2 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:19.649
 Any square change in x, + 

00:04:19.649 --> 00:04:23.440
 Change box in y 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:24.620
 There is nothing fantastic 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.770
 Sometimes some people call it the distance formula 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:29.380
 It's Pythagorean theory 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:31.660
 This square is the square + that side = 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:34.940
 The chord box, because this triangle is present 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:38.260
 So let 's apply them to these numbers, ie setups 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:39.410
 In our hands 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:43.020
 Space box = delta x ^ 2 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:47.580
 Ie 3 ^ 2 + Delta y ^ 2, ie + 4 ^ 2 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:53.080
 Which equals 9 + 16, and equals 25 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.050
 If the distance is equal - let me write it - d ^ 2 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:57.550
 = 25 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:01.600
 d, any distance, = - we do not want to take 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.160
 Negative square root, because we can not have 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.370
 Negative distance, he square root 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:09.020
 The square root is positive for 25, which equals 5 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:10.780
 If this distance is equal to 5 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.130
 Or if you look at this distance, where it was 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:13.920
 The original issue 

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:16.170
 How much after this point about that point? 

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:20.180
 It is 5 units away 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:22.930
 What you see here, is called the distance formula 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:24.730
 But Pythagorean theory 

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:27.000
 And even exposed to all the ways that 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.770
 You will encounter a formula of distance, sometimes some people may say 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:33.340
 If I have two points, if one, let's call it 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:37.580
 x1 and y1, if this point 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:42.880
 Let's assume that I have another point is x2, y2 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:45.760
 You will sometimes see this formula, where the distance - 

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:46.940
 You'll see it in different ways 

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:49.850
 But you will see that the distance = - and 

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:52.170
 Looks like a complicated formula 

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:53.930
 But I want to see this 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:55.370
 Phitagors theory 

00:05:55.370 --> 00:06:05.340
 As you see that the distance = x2 - x1) ^ 2) 

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:18.650
 + y2 - y1) ^ 2) 

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:20.950
 As you can see, this is written in a systematic way 

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:22.200
 Distance formula 

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:24.855
 Distance formula 

00:06:24.855 --> 00:06:27.250
 It is simply a loss of your time if you want to save it 

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:30.060
 It is a theory of Pythagoras 

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:32.370
 This is the change in x 

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:34.710
 In fact it does not matter which x we ​​will choose to be first 

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:36.730
 Or second, because even if you get a negative image of these 

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:39.470
 When you square it, the negative sign disappears 

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:42.900
 This is the change in y 

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:44.693
 It shows that the space box - remember 

00:06:44.693 --> 00:06:48.710
 If you cross the two sides of the equation, the root symbol 

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:51.010
 The space box will disappear 

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:54.900
 The box for this statement equals delta x ^ 2 

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:59.090
 The change in x-delta means the amount of change - delta x ^ 2 

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:01.540
 + Delta y ^ 2 

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:02.190
 I do not want to bother you 

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:04.170
 Delta y means the change in y 

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:06.380
 Maybe I should say it at the beginning of the show 

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:09.290
 But let me apply this to more examples, and I will pick some 

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:10.030
 Points randomly 

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:14.850
 Let's assume that I have a point, let's say, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:17.660
 6, -4- 

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:22.370
 6, -4- 

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:24.430
 Let's assume I want to find the distance between that and 

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:32.290
 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 1.7, then 

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:34.370
 I want to find the distance here 

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:36.420
 It's the same idea 

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:38.610
 We will use the theory of Pythagoras 

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:41.830
 We will find the distance, ie the change in x, this 

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:43.790
 The distance, ie the change in y 

00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:45.955
 Square this space + box this distance 

00:07:45.955 --> 00:07:48.750
 = Square this distance 

00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:50.600
 Let's do it 

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:53.160
 The change in x, we take - 

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:54.130
 As you know, it does not matter 

00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:56.170
 In general, we want to take the greatest value for X- 

00:07:56.170 --> 00:07:58.400
 The smallest value for x, but you can do it in another way 

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:02.180
 Cats can write the space box = - what is 

00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:04.430
 Change in x? 

00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:08.650
 Let's take a larger value for x-smaller value for x, ie 1 - 

00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:09.430
 6 

00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:14.960
 (1 - 6) ^ 2 + change in y 

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:16.120
 The biggest value for y here 

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:17.530
 Are 7 

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:19.210
 7 

00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:22.550
 (7-4) ^ 2 

00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:24.430
 I have chosen these numbers randomly, if 

00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:26.260
 The outcome will not be clear 

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:30.490
 We get the space box = 1 - 

00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:31.280
 6 

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:35.000
 A7, 7 ^ 2, and you'll see it here too 

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.169
 If you count 

00:08:36.169 --> 00:08:39.690
 We go 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 

00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:41.470
 This issue is here 

00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:43.400
 This is the change in x 

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:46.530
 + 7 - -4 

00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:47.720
 = 11 

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:51.010
 This is the distance, and you can play after 

00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:51.490
 The squares 

00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:52.650
 We move to the top by 11 

00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:55.860
 We take 7 - -4 to get 

00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:57.740
 The distance is 11 

00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:01.750
 If + 11 ^ 2 = d ^ 2 

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:05.000
 Let me get out the calculator 

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:13.266
 If the distance if we take 7 ^ 2 + 11 ^ 2 

00:09:13.266 --> 00:09:16.170
 = 170, and that distance is equal to the square root 

00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:18.920
 So, right? d ^ 2 = 170 

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:25.250
 If we take the square root of 170 we get 13.0 

00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:28.250
 Approximately 13.04 

00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:30.550
 This is the distance we tried 

00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:35.920
 Find it is 13.04 

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:38.540
 I hope you found this useful
