Speaker 1:          00:01          Uh, hello. Hello. Oh, all of that. How are you? Oh my God. And Great. What did I do?

Speaker 2:          00:13          Literally talking to another world. I'm Jad. I am Robert. This is Radiolab and today we are reconnecting with an old producer of ours. Brenna feral. Yeah. Past life. Yeah. Ooh. Since leaving Radiolab, she's been busy with work, but also raising two kids is crazy hard with family. Just trying to like take my vitamins and like exist on a low grade panic attack all day. Well I guess we should start by, let's just try and recall like what it was. That's, I don't even know how you bumped in. You don't normally,

Speaker 1:          00:41          okay. So back in 2015, my husband, nick and I were in our tiny apartment back in Brooklyn and we were new parents. Our Son Marty was 18 months old at the time and one morning, I think it was about 5:00 AM like still dark. Marty woke up and he was just, you know, crying, crying, crying. And so I tapped my husband. It was his turn to get up early and go get Marty. So he got out of bed. I fell right back to sleep and the next thing I knew, I was like, felt somebody tapping me and I sort of rolled over in my bed and there was just this little person looking up at me covered at this greasy stuff all over. His face was shiny and he was laughing and he held up in his hand this giant jar of diaper ointment, the special medicated stuff that we had bought just that last week. And I just thought, oh my God, he just ate all this medicine and I have no idea how much he ate. And I look around at my husband who had gotten up with him, changed his diaper, and they put them down on the floor to play head because he was exhausted falling asleep in the chair right

Speaker 2:          01:46          while watching him. So I just flung myself to the end of the bed and I grabbed Marty in one arm and started frantically searching the label, which was filled with words like petrolatum, Sarasin, panthenol glycerin is a Bolo. The Brenda says she didn't register any of those words because right underneath that list of ingredients I just saw this bold type that said a if

Speaker 1:          02:10          swallowed, call your doctor or poison control center immediately.

Speaker 3:          02:17          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          02:17          and so I'm clutching my son and I'm clutching his jar. And then I yelled to my husband to wake him up and I'm like, I need you to find the number and call poison control while I hold Marty. And so nick snaps into action, leaps off the chair into the other room so he can make the call and Brenna is left sitting there in the bed holding her 18 month old son who is about to throw up, pass out, die. She's not sure like have you ever felt that hollow feeling where you're like your whole chest just drops and you just, it's like, it feels like missing a step. You're like, he's just utterly sick. And then just like all sweaty up in my temple. So I'm sitting on the edge of our bed, Marty's in my lap and I'm eagle eye watching for like whatever's about to happening to him. And I had always heard that like you have your mother's instinct or whatever that is, and like moms know best and moms can tell when something's wrong with their kid and like sometimes, maybe that's true, but for me Brenda says she just froze.

Speaker 4:          03:13          Wow.

Speaker 2:          03:14          I was imagining like this huge like glop of ointment has worked its way down your esophagus and now what is it doing to your stomach lining and what's going to happen when it had like, I was just like, I can't take it back. Like what do I do? So nick has gone to the next room and I hear that he's on the phone with someone and then just moments later he came back out and he said, well, that was the most pleasant phone call I've had in ages.

Speaker 4:          03:49          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          03:49          there he was completely calm, kind of like smiling at me in the doorway and I'm just still hunched over the bed, like hanging on to Marty thinking what is going on?

Speaker 2:          04:00          So nick straightened up and then went into like, oh, okay, here's what happened. I called, they immediately picked up and then it says that Nick told her, you talked to this man, the guy asked him, super matter of fact how much Marty weighed. Nick told him that 20 pounds or whatever. Yes. Then what brand of diaper ointment did Marty eat? They told him the brand. Yeah. And then the guy did a little mental math and said, your child's going to be fine. Totally fine. Those was probably not a big deal at all. It was really common. No vomiting, no, no, nothing. Nope. He was like, just like a slippery little piglet at that point. So cleaned him up and then, uh, you know, let him play

Speaker 4:          04:38          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          04:38          but for the rest of the day I just kept thinking, what the Hell is poison control? I honestly didn't think we still lived in a world where you could just call a hotline, like get on the telephone and talk to a live human who somehow knows everything about this one specific brand of diaper ointment. And then Bam, like 45 seconds later, this full blown crisis in my mind was just gone. And then I, you know, I just was having this weird moment of like, there's this invisible network out there that was just kind of primed and waiting to help, um, who are these people? So a few months later, I'm totally obsessed with poison control. Let me check, check, check. And I ended up in a skyscraper in downtown Chicago up 19 floors down these four twisty turny corridors to the oldest poison control center in America are here. Tony, when it got there, you know, our staff for service of natural light, Carol, the senior director, it took me on a tour a lot smaller than I would have expected even though it's not a dome, but it definitely is an office was uh, I, you know, I think I was expecting like just banks of like high tech gleaming computers and instead that phone hasn't worked in at least five years, but it's still there. It was this narrow office with Greg carpet. You have a crusty mushroom up there, great

Speaker 5:          05:58          cubicles. I don't know who's cubs hat that is, but it's been here for a while. At least. Kind of reminded me of like a basement college computer lab, you know, like where all the machines are kind of still running windows 95 or something like that and sitting in front of those computers or the poisoned specialists. Um, I'm, I'm the steak bite person. I love paneling steak by calls. Here's Aaron who's in snakes, like the little old lady who's like working in her backyard and there was a snake and she chops off his head with a shovel and then she brings a snake head into the Er to show them what bitter. And there's Connie, I'm sort of the go to person for mushrooms. How I look at it. She takes us room calls even when she's on vacation. Is that true? Yes. And she gets excited about it. There's Cindy who used to work in the Er. I'm a nurse by background is Jessica, take the home calls, there's art, all of it. It's all fun. And then Brian is here. There's Tony, he's the expert in everything Illinois poison center. And while I was there, the stream of calls, it was just nonstop. If I buy, as soon as one of them would hang up, the phone was in the center, Illinois poisons, another call would come in and five normally healthy.

Speaker 5:          07:05          Okay, gently wipe off his lips with little warm water on a washcloth, give him something to drink. They all told me that in order to work here, you need a background in medicine, special training and toxicology. On top of that, it helps to have a good memory, good math skills, but you know, more importantly what you really need is to be able to stay calm, calm. I usually tell people they're going to be overwhelmed by the first three months was in center because sometimes the calls, you know, glow stick is not going to be a problem. They're adorable, but other times, boy, they're like this. He has a temperature of 104 this is an er call is a sugar. Again, the hospital was calling about a male patient who had been found unconscious, completely sweaty, diaphoretic at home, so the medics are assessing him. His blood sugar was 40 is Tylenol is three 72 his pupils, she said are bouncing all over the place. I don't know what that is. After she hung up, I asked Cindy if this was a self harm call. It's believed to be yes. She was saying that his wife just died of cancer. Yeah. Is that somewhat rare to get one that serious? No, not at all. We get them all the time. At least

Speaker 6:          08:19          [inaudible] center.

Speaker 5:          08:22          Can you spell that? Can you spell the name of that drug and how many milligrams did you say? I ended up spending about 12 hours there that day and if you sit in a poison control center that long, you just poison center. These calls are washing over you. They're just coming and coming and coming and center. You start to feel just kind of overwhelmed by the fact that every single time the phone rings, there's somebody on the other side of the line and they're in a moment of uncertainty or panic. When did she take the Tylenol overdose crisis? This could be pretty

Speaker 1:          08:56          serious and the scale of that is just kind of shocking. We manage 80,000 calls a year out of this room and that's just this one center that's just Chicago. If you take the poison centers all across the country, they handle almost 3 million cases a year, so you get a call like mine or much worse about every 14 seconds or so. You know, this is a very poisonous planet and thinking about just how many of us are bumping into these things that we think might be poisoning us, snuck mercury that are poisoning us. Gold is poisonous to some extent. Silver, not so poisonous, but it'll turn you blue. I decided to call up Debra [inaudible], director of the Knight Science Journalism Program at MIT and poison enthusiast. I love poison. It's true. I even wrote a book called the Poisoner's Handbook. You're my husband worries about that a lot. In fact, he has not let me pour him a cup of coffee for the last six years since my book came out.

Speaker 1:          09:56          Very serious. He really was. Seriously, he's always like, oh, I'll get it. So never says it helps to kind of think of poison control as part of this much larger back and forth kind of a dance and evolving dance that we've been doing with our poisonous planet for thousands of years. We've been dancing with them in different ways for a very long time. If you go back and look at the hieroglyphics in Egypt, there's actually references to death by peach and that refers to cyanide poisoning because cyanides are the primary poison than the pits of peaches and flying peaches actually written in a wall of a temple somewhere or that's exactly right. Endeavor says, if you go back to the beginning of that dance, you'll find that like with so many things, it starts with murder because we humans first got really interested in poisons when we realized we could use them to kill each other, and one of my favorite examples is actually our snack, which in early 19th century Europe was by all accounts, the perfect comma to Seidel poison.

Speaker 1:          10:56          It was tasteless. It was odorless. You could put it into vanilla pudding or oatmeal mimic the natural illness. Gee, Connell looked like they had a bad gastroenteritis. And at the time we had no way of detecting it. Literally when we come into the 19th century, science has not figured out a way to detect a single poison in a corpse. We'll so what ruined this perfect murder? Well, there was a chemist in Breton named James Marsh who worked out this incredibly, it's, I mean by just standards today, primitive test, which involved mincing up the tissue from the dead person and adding some acid and heating it up and distilling it. And then as this vapor comes out, it cool onto glass. And if there was any arsenic in the original tissue, that arsenic forms tiny dark crystals and you've got a sort of blackish silver mirror forming over the glass. And that was actually the first great test in, uh, forensic toxicology, the marsh test. This is sort of the moment Deborah says that modern science joins our dance with poison because as you see the rise of industrial chemistry and and our ability to synthesize cyanide and strychnine and some of these amazingly toxic elements, you also see people's realization of how useful they are.

Speaker 5:          12:22          Man, people are so cool around here. Where are we in Soho? We're in West Soho, West Soho. What started happening was at the beginning of the 20th century, there were all these new cleaning products hitting the market designed to kill germs and pharmaceutical products designed to kill headaches or whatever, and suddenly all these poisons that used to just be out there in nature. We're in our homes or in the drugstore for example. You see it's fun sunglasses there. Here are producers, any mcewen and McKelvy ticking a jaunt. Okay, here we are in Hudson pharmacy on our time on Tuesday afternoon. This is during working hours and they only got the weird devito. Flavors come in to the local drug store cleaning aisle. Wow. So draino bottom of the shelf, easy for kids to reach. Now let's read the ingredients contain sodium hypochlorite, sodium hydroxide, and sodium silicate. Okay, let me see.

Speaker 5:          13:16          One second. Quick check. Online sodium hydroxide. According to Wikipedia, it's used to digest tissues. Say there's like roadkill in a landfill. They hope put the roadkill in a sealed container with sodium hydroxide and water. It's like breaking bad. Yeah, and the body turns into a liquid with coffee, like appearance. Apparently. It's like turns people into coffee. Yeah, little higher on the shelf. Everybody's favorite childhood cartoon, Mr. Clean Meadows and rains. Then same thing. Sodium hydroxide coffee. People don't open it. Don't open it. It's not as if, okay, I have to buy it. No, look as I, what's this thing? This will amounts. There's Windex, Windex, oh, this one is just called ammonia. If you mix ammonia and bleach, what happens? A poisonous gas results also occurs naturally in the atmosphere of Jupiter and Saturn. That's impressive. Next one, this little gray bottle up on the highest shelf. Goodall's brush and Kapa Polish, a brass and copper Polish and contains to detoxy ethanol. It has a sweet ether like odor and I'm going to, Oh, you just open it and smell it. Oh, it said harmful, if any. Okay. Well it says it can cause adrenal tumors in animals. It's carcinogenic and rodents.

Speaker 5:          14:36          I hope I didn't smell too much of it. Matt. Let's just get out of here. You don't want to get some chips. All right.

Speaker 1:          14:43          We're very comfortable with the fact that we walked down the grocery store aisle or open up the medicine chest and we're surrounded by these, you

Speaker 5:          14:52          know, in pill form or liquid form or spray form or whatever, but these different compounds that actually are dangerous. We're used to that. We live with that. Right? Snakes, which brings us to a guy. Let's see. Oh, and I use a plaque for Lewis. Good. Actually, I saw this plaque dedicated to him on the wall at the poison center in Chicago, appreciation of the initiative and devoted service of Louis Godalming RPH, founder of the poison and drug information center. Anyway, a guy named Louis [inaudible], Louis Scotoma and who is a brilliant scientists in the state of Illinois. Louis passed away back in 1995 but his wife Catherine, yes, it's still very much alive. Absolutely. She's 98 now, but she met Louis back when she was a 20 year old nurse working in the Saint Luke's hospital in Chicago. It was 1948 and he was a pharmacist in the hospital and everybody knew Lou and we all loved him.

Speaker 5:          15:45          And I was the lucky one. I caught him. Louis was sort of a shorter man, dark hair, big dark eyebrows, and he had a great personality and he would take care of everything that came along friendly. But when it came to his work, he took it very seriously. The pharmacy was directly across the hall from the Emergency Room. And so what started happening is, and noticed this trend, like just to back up, this is the 1940s and doctors are totally winning against infectious diseases. And what that meant was that as far as the public was concerned, keeping your family healthy in germ free is a big deal. And that meant keeping your home clean, super leaving Cli duper no. Why clean it, really look clean that day. And at the same time,

Speaker 7:          16:29          oh, that guy,

Speaker 5:          16:30          there's just this explosion of new cleaning products coming into the market. Babbo glean your thing brighter than any other cleanser in the world. Johnson's jubilee, new blue cheer. Great for as well as long. So our kitchen cabinets and cupboards under the bathroom sink meeting, oxycodone was getting like filled up with all of these things. Extremely smelly powders and liquids, brightly colored bottles and boxes. Oh, leaving cute Mr clean is now the most powerful I've ever put into a box.

Speaker 8:          16:58          Ooh, good.

Speaker 5:          17:01          And getting back to Lewis, what he began to notice was that more and more these doctors were coming across the hall to his pharmacy, like first one and then more and more. And you know, they're saying like, Hey, we've got this kid over in the Er. He just got into this new cleaning stuff and we have no idea what's in it. Can you help us? So, uh, the interns and residents in the emergency room would naturally come across the hall to see Lou and Lou helped them find out what the child had taken. For example, if the child had swallowed Ajax Guy,

Speaker 5:          17:31          that meant he had actually eaten sodium carbonate and sodium decile benzene sulfonate, which could mean nausea, diarrhea or vomiting. And Lou used to keep cards on every patient that it saw. So with each new product that was brought into the emergency room, Lou would write up a new card, white sail, bleach, sodium hypochlorite, just pain, vomiting, safety. Glueck decided this was a a thing that was very needed because by the 1950s there are over 250,000 different trade names, substances on the market. And so doctors, they just couldn't keep up and so lose stack of cards. It grew taller and taller and taller and pretty soon word got out. Dogs across the country would hear that there's this guy in Chicago who gives out help on poisoning cases and so many calls are coming in at all hours of the day and night eventually get dom and just started telling the switchboard operators they could go ahead and transfer the call to his home.

Speaker 9:          18:24          We, you get calls from all the different little law in emergency rooms in the hospitals. In the state. And what was, what was it like once you're doing this, then it seems to me that you don't really have normal hours because emergencies will take place whenever they take place. So yes. How did, what was he going to be on call 24 hours a day? Yes. Really? Yes. Yes he was. We would get calls in the middle of the night or even during dinner time. So what happens if you know he's in the tub and you're cooking dinner and the phone rings? I would take the phone to him and the time and uh,

Speaker 5:          19:09          that's the way it started. And eventually lose little operation became the first poison control center in the United States in 1953 in Chicago.

Speaker 9:          19:19          One 802 two, two one, two do do one 802, two, two, one, two, two, two k up your thing. Get Mad at poison. And the first thing you should do, who is calling? One 802 two, two one, two, two, two. Oh, Isen is the kind of thing you'll not suppose to touch. All prescriptions cleaned and stuff for spider bites and such. If you swallowed something bad. Oh, thank you. Took two months. Call the poison control center hotline. We're the people you can trust for posting.

Speaker 2:          21:48          A bad world cuff is better than their workout. Do you bet your ass do one Jad Robert Radiolab. So we are back with your porter, Brenna Farrell, who is continuing to um, to inquire into things poisonous. Before the break, we just, uh, learned about Lewis Godolphin who started the oldest poison control center in the country back in 1953 in Chicago. Yeah. And so today, now we have 55 poison control centers all across the country and it's one phone number that anyone anywhere in the u s can call whenever they need help. What poison center are there at certain times of day? Like is there a rhythm to the day? Generally

Speaker 12:         22:28          usual pattern. It's busy in the morning and kids are getting ready for school and the peasant anyways for were people brushing your teeth with muscle rub cream, kids drinking a little mouthwash, eating some sunscreen, eating some old mayonnaise, double doses in the morning. You know, each parent will give the kid a ADHD medication or then the mid afternoon kind of tapers down a little bit til like four or five is the slowest and then that evening, the busiest time of the day overall and it's like between 6:00 PM and 10:00 PM people coming home from work trying to get dinner superglue instead of eyedrops superglue instead of lip gloss. People take the the dodger cast medicine by mistake instead of their normal medication. Yeah, that's a frequent scenario. It gets to be with adults. I have literally, I have a list here of all the things that have been used instead of blue. It's just busy. It's, you know, just a hectic schedule that

Speaker 2:          23:24          we're living in right now and good almonds, old stack of cards that's become this huge database that's tracking like in real time these things that are cropping up. Salmonella that may have made 22 people sick already, whether it's a salmonella outbreak or like last 11 deaths appear to be connected to heroin being sold in western New York that's laced with fentanyl.

Speaker 1:          23:46          Oh, weird drug reaction that people are having. Or maybe it's a new product that's unexpectedly dangerous or laundry detergent pods that look like candy. Now they are being linked to a tragic death of a child. They can see that in real time and let health officials or whoever else know about it. Wow. Which is pretty cool. But I mean, honestly, just selfishly thinking about myself as, as a mom, um, coming out of the trip to poison control, I remember writing down this feeling of like, you know, like what if I just approached all the scary decisions in my life? The way that poisoned control did. Like what? Like kind of thinking like what would poison control do? Like it just, it felt like such a relief to be experiencing fetal Barbara Toss, 64.8 milligram tablet. And how much does she weigh? Like this super rational place.

Speaker 1:          24:33          Like it was just completely rational and when did it happen? How long ago we have this data, we're going to, what's the name of the product? Take these questions from you. Nine 25 let me see if this is even going to be a problem and then we're going to tell you this is what we think is going to happen. Okay. Stomach pain. Now she's awake and they'll let you make a decision or they'll tell you like straight up, don't worry about it. I think she's going to be a, okay, I from here. I know. And then take it again, but you will be okay. Okay. It just felt like it's stripped away. A lot of the, um, like the guilt and the anxiety and the like, should I do this and politics and all those other things that have often swirl around even seemingly to me innocuous questions about how do I keep this person, this little person's safe and healthy. There's all this stuff swirling around it and they just, we didn't have to get into any of that.

Speaker 2:          25:22          I still remains. For me the most interesting part of this is that the idea that we're supposed to know things like, you know, I talk about this with my dad. I mean there was this time in medicine when, um, it was all about the doctor in the white coat. It was this paternalistic thing. Doctor knows best and no one wants to go back there, but that there was something emotionally clean about that. Whereas now we, we have all the information, it's right there. This is hand in hand with the rise of the Internet. And so increasingly we're expected to be our own experts. And it's usually presented as this sort of simple idea that information is power and it isn't power. I mean it is, but it's also paralysis. Yeah. I actually had a rule where I wouldn't, I would only let nick look things up cause I couldn't, like I was not, it started when I was pregnant.

Speaker 2:          26:14          I like would have a panic attack cause there were so many different things and like always the top searches are the ones that like you're going to die. Um Oh yeah. And he's really, he like you get into the comments field, oh forget it. Oh God. Right. I mean there's something about when you look at an answer on a screen and you just one click away from anything, the exact opposite answer. And then when you're on the phone with someone it's just you and that person. Like there is no other distraction. Like there's something built into the technology that creates exactly

Speaker 5:          26:44          the kind of connection you need at that moment.

Speaker 11:         26:45          You know, people, when they call you, it's an emergency there that are panicking and I think half the battle is getting them to settle down. And

Speaker 5:          26:53          so this is Tony Berta, the know everything guy we mentioned earlier.

Speaker 11:         26:57          I started in February a of 81

Speaker 5:          27:00          he's been that calm voice for 30 years and while he was in pharmacy school, he had an accident. Yeah,

Speaker 11:         27:05          I actually started pharmacy school as a sighted person when I finished as a blind individual. What, what happened? I he, he didn't want to say, oh, I don't dwell on it,

Speaker 5:          27:17          but like I was sitting there seeing him doing all of this math and spitting out these numbers. Yes sir.

Speaker 11:         27:22          They're sights and half lives and volumes of distribution,

Speaker 5:          27:25          which is totally incomprehensible to me. But he told me that he also like pretty quickly had discovered early on that there was this whole other part of doing this job

Speaker 11:         27:35          since September of 82 let's see, I would have probably had like a year and a half of experience at that time. I remember I was sitting in the poison center was another pharmacist and we had the news radio or am station on, it was about 10 30 in the morning. It was news to his flash.

Speaker 13:         27:55          [inaudible]

Speaker 14:         27:55          bizarre and terrifying story today in the Chicago suburbs in Arlington heights and elk Grove village, a 12 year old girl and two men who were brothers are dead ever taking poison capsules of extra strength. Tylenol.

Speaker 11:         28:07          Several people died from Sinai that they believe was from Tylenol,

Speaker 14:         28:12          five deaths in Chicago, and that number might be changed to six. Six deaths have now been linked to the capsules, which are leased with cyanide and link.

Speaker 5:          28:19          It was this terrifying moment where thousands of people just simultaneously, we're all thinking, oh my God, this thing I brought into my home to make me feel better. It could kill me today across the country, Tylenol products were being pulled from Michelle. The police are like driving their car slowly on the street with loudspeakers. Like

Speaker 14:         28:35          I think anytime

Speaker 5:          28:39          the back your Tylenol, don't take any Tylenol extra strength for the time being until you hear otherwise. And so, you know, Tony told me, he's sitting there hearing these news broadcasts going across the radio and he just turned to the guy sitting next to him and the poison girl, senators,

Speaker 11:         28:51          holy s, we're gonna, we're gonna get killed.

Speaker 14:         28:55          Yeah.

Speaker 11:         28:59          [inaudible] your phone has been ringing off the hook at rush Presbyterian St Luke's medical center in Chicago. He says he's boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. So as soon as you hung up the phone, the phone rang again. All we've been receiving calls are about once every 15 seconds this other pharmacist at. And I just grabbed the references and try and make ourselves cyanide experts, you know, real fast

Speaker 5:          29:20          morning. And the interesting thing about this case is that in every single one of these calls that was coming in, if someone was terrified, someone was panicked, but they weren't actually in any danger.

Speaker 14:         29:31          Officials, hearsay, right? If anyone has taken a cyanide laced Tylenol capsule,

Speaker 5:          29:36          we wouldn't be able to make it to the phone call. So in some way, this moment you think about it,

Speaker 1:          29:42          it really kind of highlights this thing that is really at the heart of poison control. The specialists not only were calm, but they, they, their job was to just reassure like they were letting people know it was going to be okay. But if you flash forward to now that's changing. It's, they're getting more calls that are more serious. They're getting calls from hospitals, they're getting calls from people who have taken multiple drugs. And so does that mean that they're getting less calls from like normal people and parents that kind of, yeah, those calls are going down and they calls over all sense. Like the, in the past decade there've been fewer calls to poison control. Do you know why? My sense is we don't like to make phone calls anymore. Like people don't, they're, you know, like the Internet is there and that's what we're used to and that's easy.

Speaker 1:          30:24          And so they are, they just launched this new, like instead of calling, you can go to the website and plug in answers to the questions that they roll through and it will give you the same answer based on hopefully the same knowledge. But then as a person who's lived through it and like, oh my God, please don't take away that phone call. Because when you're in that panic, the thought of having to sit and type an answer out while you're holding your kid and like wondering if you've really screwed up. It's like you're taking away something really valuable that maybe we're not valuing here. I did have this one event when my older son, I've got two sons. It's was very little. We were living in Sacramento. Yeah. By the way, his author Deborah Bloom again and uh, they didn't have fluoridated waters so our doc gave them these tiny, cute, they were really cute fruit flavored fluoride pills, the kind of thing you could get a toddler to tay.

Speaker 1:          31:20          I don't know what we were doing, but somehow we had given him his daily fluoride pill and then like idiots left it on the kitchen counter and he grabbed it and pretty much inhaled the whole bottle and I was really free. I just didn't know how poisonous that was going to be. And I call poison control and I did I, I was like, am I suppose what I wanted to know was whether I should panic, right. I mean he seemed fine. It wasn't like he was getting sick in any way and they were completely non freaked out about it. There's like, yeah, I remember that experience. Do you remember here? Did you hear their words or did you hear their tone? It was the tone. They were so calm and they could tell I was frayed and, and it can just tell you I'm standing in the kitchen. We had this phone, my son's by me, I, you know, he can tell I'm afraid, but he doesn't really know I'm free. And I sat on the floor after I talked to them, I just sat down on the floor with him because I was just so grateful and I was, and that's what I remember is how grateful I felt.

Speaker 4:          32:34          Hello? I'm my, my two and a half year old daughter. Just the eight most of the tube of a eight, five ounce I'm saying is correct.
