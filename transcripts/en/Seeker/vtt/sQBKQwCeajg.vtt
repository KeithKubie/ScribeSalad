00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:05.830
Whenever bones that look like ours are discovered,
paleoanthropologists are on their knees looking

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:07.050
for the answer.

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:15.320
Are they human, or are they our ancestors?

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.750
Hello you bunch of homo sapiens, Julian here
for DNews.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.980
Recently scientists announced a huge find,
15 partial human-like skeletons in a cave

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:25.189
in South Africa.

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:29.830
The skeletons belong to a species no one has
seen before, and so a new species was added

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:33.080
to the human evolutionary tree: Homo naledi.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.940
Homo is a really cool word, because it pulls
double duty.

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.690
From its greek origins, it means “the same,”
and is the opposite of “hetero.”

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.750
The latin root of homo means “man” or
“human being.”

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.470
When we find a new species and put in the
genus Homo, it’s a big deal.

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.809
But how do we figure out what species deserves
the honor of being called Homo?

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:52.900
Well the skull is a good place to start.

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.380
Humans today have large brains and small teeth.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.950
Our cousins, the apes, are the opposite.

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:01.969
So, when figuring out if a skull belongs to
your family tree, we look there.

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:05.920
Mind you, just because a creature had small
teeth doesn’t mean it had a large brain.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.720
Homo naledi is a good example of that.

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.140
The teeth are small and primitive, but the
brain is only about as big as a large orange.

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:17.140
Homo naledi is about 3 million years old though,
and from the fossil record right now we believe

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:22.000
that brain size really started ramping up
800,000 to 200,000 years ago.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.290
And I can already hear a lot of you asking
me about dating, and I’d love to.

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.460
Oh you meant the age of the skeletons?...

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.370
Alright, that’s fine, I’m not heartbroken
or anything.

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:36.950
There are actually multiple accurate methods
used for figuring out how old a fossil is

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.210
and thus where it fits on the human timeline.

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.829
For younger fossils with DNA still intact,
we can compare how similar the DNA is to ours

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.119
and other species.

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.189
Older fossils can be dated by examining how
much of certain radioactive elements are present.

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:54.290
These elements, like potassium, argon, carbon
14, and uranium decay at a steady rate, so

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.060
measuring how much is left can accurately
place a date.

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.680
There’s thermo-luminescence, optically stimulated
luminescence, and electron spin resonance

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.100
methods that measure how many electrons have
been trapped in a rock or tooth over eons.

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.290
What I’m getting at is we don’t just find
bones and go, “Gee that looks super old,

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:11.720
I’m gonna go with 3 million years.

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.360
Yep, that sounds about right.”

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.230
Fossils are finicky things though, what with
being millions of years old and often buried

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.540
accidentally, and usually a lot of the pieces
are gone.

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.770
But even without a skull the other bones can
tell us how close a species was to human.

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:29.360
The shape of the spine, legs, hips, and feet
can tell us if a species walked upright, lived

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.910
in trees, or some combination of both.

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.750
How thick the bones are can tell us how active
they were.

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.860
Teeth and gut size can tell us what they ate,
with larger guts being useful for digesting

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:39.860
plants.

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.160
The hands can either be flat like ours or
curved like apes.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.370
And finally, where the bones are found and
other items around them give us clues about

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:48.420
our ancestors.

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:49.420
Did they have tools?

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.570
Did they have language and culture?

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:55.740
Homo naledi was a big surprise because even
though the fossils are so old, they appeared

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.380
to be buried in the cave like a burial chamber.

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.170
We thought that was a much more recent human
habit, so our understanding will have to be

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:03.170
reshaped.

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.340
When talking about the remains of those that
came before us, it helps to remember that

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.260
they don’t all fall neatly in a straight
line.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.210
As we were finding our way into existence,
other species branched off and became more

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:17.450
different, like Homo floresiensis, a recent
relative who became tiny with smaller brains

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:18.810
and larger teeth.

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.090
Others branched out and then mixed back in
with our ancestors a bit, like the now-extinct

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:24.090
neanderthals.

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:28.420
Instead of a simple line, human lineage is
more like a tree, Below the Homo branch of

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.760
the tree there’s the Paranthropus group,
and another separate branch belongs to the

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:33.760
Australopithecus.

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.690
Farthest down and closest to where our line
split from apes is the Ardipithecus branch.

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:42.350
Finding a fossil takes a lot of luck, and
determining where each fossil fits on the

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:46.160
path to become us is still debated by paleoanthropologists.

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.440
Homo naledi is up for that same rigorous debate,
and where it fits in the puzzle may change.

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:55.300
But right now the clues the skull, skeleton,
age, and environment make it the oldest member

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:56.910
of the Homo genus yet.

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:01.070
For me, looking across the millions of years
of trial and error it took for us to finally

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:04.230
exist gives me a great appreciation for being
human.

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:32.660
