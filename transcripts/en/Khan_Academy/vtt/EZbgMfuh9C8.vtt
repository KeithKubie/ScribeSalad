00:00:00.777 --> 00:00:01.831
- [Instructor] A particle moving

00:00:01.831 --> 00:00:04.273
in the XY plane has velocity vector given

00:00:04.273 --> 00:00:07.031
by V of T is equal to
all of this business,

00:00:07.031 --> 00:00:09.261
and so using this notation, it just means

00:00:09.261 --> 00:00:12.498
that the X component of
velocity as a function

00:00:12.498 --> 00:00:14.368
of the time is one over T plus seven,

00:00:14.368 --> 00:00:16.023
and the Y component of velocity

00:00:16.023 --> 00:00:18.023
as a function of time is T to the fourth

00:00:18.023 --> 00:00:20.743
for time T greater than or equal to zero.

00:00:20.743 --> 00:00:22.703
At T equals one, the particle is

00:00:22.703 --> 00:00:25.683
at the point three comma four.

00:00:25.683 --> 00:00:28.393
So the first part is what is the magnitude

00:00:28.393 --> 00:00:30.549
of the displacement of the particle

00:00:30.549 --> 00:00:34.189
between time T equals
one and T equals three?

00:00:34.189 --> 00:00:35.860
And then we need to
figure out its position,

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.116
and we need to round to the nearest 10th.

00:00:37.116 --> 00:00:38.574
So like always, pause this video,

00:00:38.574 --> 00:00:40.391
and I think you'll have
to use a calculator,

00:00:40.391 --> 00:00:43.967
but pause this video and try
to work through it on your own.

00:00:43.967 --> 00:00:47.354
So we've done questions
like this in one dimension,

00:00:47.354 --> 00:00:48.870
but now we're doing it in two dimensions,

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.744
but the key is is to just break it up

00:00:50.744 --> 00:00:52.390
into the component dimensions.

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:54.598
So what we really want to do
is let's find the displacement

00:00:54.598 --> 00:00:57.785
in the X direction, so
really just the change in X,

00:00:57.785 --> 00:00:59.199
and then let's just find the displacement

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:01.653
in the vertical direction
or our change in Y,

00:01:01.653 --> 00:01:02.851
and then we can use those,

00:01:02.851 --> 00:01:04.993
essentially using the Pythagorean theorem,

00:01:04.993 --> 00:01:08.011
to find that the magnitude
of the total displacement,

00:01:08.011 --> 00:01:10.705
and also, if we know the
change in X and change in Y,

00:01:10.705 --> 00:01:12.704
we just add the change in X to the three,

00:01:12.704 --> 00:01:14.283
and we add the change in Y to the four

00:01:14.283 --> 00:01:16.102
to find the particle's position

00:01:16.102 --> 00:01:18.019
at time T equals three.

00:01:18.992 --> 00:01:20.010
So let's figure it out.

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:24.494
So change in X from T equals
one to T equals three,

00:01:24.494 --> 00:01:26.638
well, that's just gonna be the integral

00:01:26.638 --> 00:01:29.644
of the rate function in the X direction

00:01:29.644 --> 00:01:32.511
from time equal one to time equals three,

00:01:32.511 --> 00:01:35.708
so in the X direction, we
have one over T plus seven.

00:01:35.708 --> 00:01:38.605
That's our X velocity
as a function of time,

00:01:38.605 --> 00:01:40.688
one over T plus seven DT,

00:01:42.664 --> 00:01:44.774
and what is this going to be equal to?

00:01:44.774 --> 00:01:47.236
Well, you do might want
to do u-substitution

00:01:47.236 --> 00:01:49.122
if you're unfamiliar,
but you might recognize

00:01:49.122 --> 00:01:52.558
that the derivative of T
plus seven is just one,

00:01:52.558 --> 00:01:53.391
so you could think of this

00:01:53.391 --> 00:01:55.768
as one times one over T plus seven,

00:01:55.768 --> 00:01:58.250
and so we really can just
take the antiderivative then

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.536
with respect to T plus seven,

00:02:00.536 --> 00:02:03.508
so you get the natural
log of the absolute value

00:02:03.508 --> 00:02:04.841
of T plus seven,

00:02:06.346 --> 00:02:09.943
and we are going to evaluate that at three

00:02:09.943 --> 00:02:11.528
and then subtract from that.

00:02:11.528 --> 00:02:13.259
It evaluated at one,

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:14.580
so this is going to be the natural log

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.184
of the absolute value of 10,

00:02:16.184 --> 00:02:19.876
which is just the natural log of 10

00:02:19.876 --> 00:02:23.020
minus the natural log of
the absolute value of eight,

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:24.819
which is just the natural log of eight,

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:28.893
which is equal to the
natural log of 10 over eight,

00:02:28.893 --> 00:02:30.659
just using our logarithm properties,

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:34.903
which is equal to the natural log of 1.25,

00:02:34.903 --> 00:02:36.001
so I could get my calculator out

00:02:36.001 --> 00:02:37.921
in a second to calculate that.

00:02:37.921 --> 00:02:38.842
Actually, let's just...

00:02:38.842 --> 00:02:40.286
Well, I'll do that in a second,

00:02:40.286 --> 00:02:42.572
and then, let's figure
out our change in Y.

00:02:42.572 --> 00:02:44.784
Our change in Y, once again,

00:02:44.784 --> 00:02:47.458
we're gonna take the
integral from one to three.

00:02:47.458 --> 00:02:51.985
That's the time over which
we're thinking about the change,

00:02:51.985 --> 00:02:55.067
and then what is the Y
component of our velocity?

00:02:55.067 --> 00:02:58.082
Well, it's T to the fourth DT.

00:02:58.082 --> 00:02:59.925
Well, this is going to be...

00:02:59.925 --> 00:03:03.778
Take the reverse power rule
T to the fifth over five

00:03:03.778 --> 00:03:05.196
at three and one,

00:03:05.196 --> 00:03:09.628
so this is three to the fifth
over five is 243 over five

00:03:09.628 --> 00:03:13.048
minus one to the fifth
over five minus 1/5,

00:03:13.048 --> 00:03:14.435
so this is equal

00:03:14.435 --> 00:03:15.852
to 242 over five,

00:03:17.737 --> 00:03:20.198
which is what, 48.4?

00:03:20.198 --> 00:03:21.031
48.4.

00:03:22.667 --> 00:03:24.414
Now let me get my calculator out

00:03:24.414 --> 00:03:26.831
for this natural log of 1.25.

00:03:27.667 --> 00:03:28.500
1.25,

00:03:30.455 --> 00:03:31.745
natural log,

00:03:31.745 --> 00:03:33.269
and we'll just round
to two decimal places,

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:34.852
approximately 0.22,

00:03:35.801 --> 00:03:38.301
so this is approximately 0.22.

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.419
So I figured out our change
in X and our change in Y,

00:03:42.419 --> 00:03:43.992
and actually, just from that,

00:03:43.992 --> 00:03:46.189
we can answer the second
part of the question first.

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:48.653
What is the particle's
position at T equals three?

00:03:48.653 --> 00:03:52.066
Well, it's going to be our
position at T equals one,

00:03:52.066 --> 00:03:53.777
where to each of the components

00:03:53.777 --> 00:03:55.957
we add the respective change,

00:03:55.957 --> 00:03:57.161
so we would add...

00:03:57.161 --> 00:04:00.355
So this would be three plus our change

00:04:00.355 --> 00:04:02.248
in X from T equals one

00:04:02.248 --> 00:04:03.947
to T equals three,

00:04:03.947 --> 00:04:07.144
and it would be four plus our change in Y.

00:04:07.144 --> 00:04:10.448
So this is going to be equal
to three plus our change in X.

00:04:10.448 --> 00:04:13.213
Well, that's going to
be approximately 3.22,

00:04:13.213 --> 00:04:18.093
and four plus our change
in Y, that is, what, 52.4.

00:04:18.093 --> 00:04:20.510
This right over here is 52.4,

00:04:23.051 --> 00:04:25.453
but we still have to
answer the first question.

00:04:25.453 --> 00:04:27.381
What is the magnitude of the displacement?

00:04:27.381 --> 00:04:28.818
Well, it's the Pythagorean theorem.

00:04:28.818 --> 00:04:30.725
I'll draw a very rough
sketch of what's going on.

00:04:30.725 --> 00:04:33.793
Sometimes it's useful to visualize it.

00:04:33.793 --> 00:04:37.246
So our initial position
is at three comma four,

00:04:37.246 --> 00:04:38.913
so three comma four,

00:04:40.613 --> 00:04:42.365
so we're right over there,

00:04:42.365 --> 00:04:45.260
and we figured out our
change in X isn't much.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.741
So our change in X is a positives 0.22,

00:04:47.741 --> 00:04:51.009
so our change in X, we're
barely moving in that direction,

00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:53.996
and our change in Y is 48.4,

00:04:53.996 --> 00:04:56.757
so we have a dramatic change.

00:04:56.757 --> 00:05:00.675
It really goes off the charts
over here in that direction,

00:05:00.675 --> 00:05:03.429
but if we wanted to add them together,

00:05:03.429 --> 00:05:04.986
if we want to add those vectors together,

00:05:04.986 --> 00:05:08.957
you could shift over your
change in Y right over here

00:05:08.957 --> 00:05:11.139
and then find the hypotenuse.

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:13.748
The length of the hypotenuse
would be the magnitude

00:05:13.748 --> 00:05:15.939
of the entire displacement,

00:05:15.939 --> 00:05:18.443
and so let's do that.

00:05:18.443 --> 00:05:19.961
So the magnitude

00:05:19.961 --> 00:05:23.409
of the displacement is
going to be the square root

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:25.576
of our change in X squared

00:05:27.711 --> 00:05:31.742
plus our change in Y squared once again.

00:05:31.742 --> 00:05:33.509
This is just the Pythagorean theorem,

00:05:33.509 --> 00:05:35.105
and what is this going to be?

00:05:35.105 --> 00:05:38.044
I'll get my calculator out again for this.

00:05:38.044 --> 00:05:40.036
Okay, that was our change in X.

00:05:40.036 --> 00:05:41.453
Let me square it,

00:05:42.517 --> 00:05:45.850
and then plus we are going to have 48.4,

00:05:47.164 --> 00:05:48.914
8.4, squared is equal

00:05:51.572 --> 00:05:53.199
to this right over here,

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:55.403
and then we take the square root of that,

00:05:55.403 --> 00:05:57.656
so this is going to be...

00:05:57.656 --> 00:05:59.263
See if we...

00:05:59.263 --> 00:06:02.278
Right over there, and there you go.

00:06:02.278 --> 00:06:05.130
The magnitude of our
total displacement is 48,

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:08.766
if we round to the nearest 10th, 48.4.

00:06:08.766 --> 00:06:11.266
So this is approximately 48.4,

00:06:14.081 --> 00:06:15.306
and we're done.

00:06:15.306 --> 00:06:17.866
Now, one thing that you might be noting is

00:06:17.866 --> 00:06:20.809
it looks like our total
displacement, 48.4, is the same

00:06:20.809 --> 00:06:23.224
as our change in Y.

00:06:23.224 --> 00:06:25.891
Now, the reason why it
came out this way is

00:06:25.891 --> 00:06:28.937
because our change in Y was exactly 48.4

00:06:28.937 --> 00:06:29.770
while the magnitude

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:32.459
of our displacement was
slightly more than 48.4,

00:06:32.459 --> 00:06:35.842
but when we round to the
nearest 10th, we got to 48.4.

00:06:35.842 --> 00:06:38.355
The reason why they are so
close is because our change

00:06:38.355 --> 00:06:39.855
in X was so small.

00:06:40.904 --> 00:06:43.774
We're talking about
0.22 as the change in X,

00:06:43.774 --> 00:06:46.237
and our change in Y was so much

00:06:46.237 --> 00:06:49.558
that our hypotenuse was
only slightly longer

00:06:49.558 --> 00:06:53.684
than our change in Y, so
that's why we got this result

00:06:53.684 --> 00:06:56.060
for this particular instance.

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:58.367
In general, you're going
to see the magnitude

00:06:58.367 --> 00:07:01.380
of the displacement is going to be larger

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:05.223
than the magnitude of either our change

00:07:05.223 --> 00:07:07.336
in X or our change in Y alone.
