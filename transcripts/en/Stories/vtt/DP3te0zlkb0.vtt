00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:04.220
CALEB HOLLOWAY: I
was on board April

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:09.690
the 20th of 2010 whenever the
unfortunate tragedy of the rig

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.060
explosion happened.

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:14.714
We had a lot of really good
guys perish that night.

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:19.990
INTERVIEWER 1: That's
Caleb Holloway, an oil rig

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.340
worker who survived the
Deepwater Horizon accident.

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.240
Arguably one of the worst
man-made catastrophes

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:27.240
in history.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.430
The massive offshore
explosion, caused by a blowout,

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:33.220
destroyed the rig
itself, causing a fire

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:35.570
that burned for 36 hours.

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.610
But that wasn't
nearly the end of it,

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.860
for the next 87 days oil
leaked into the Gulf leading

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.130
to widespread pollution
that's still a problem today.

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.480
At 8 PM On April 20th,
2010, the Macondo Well

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.010
below Deepwater Horizon
was deemed stable.

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.430
The drilling crew was toward
the end of a 21 day hitch,

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:02.460
shortly to return home to shore.

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.129
But as night fell the
unthinkable happened.

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.650
Explosions tore Horizon apart,
the rig turned into an inferno.

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.080
Many jumped overboard
half-coated in oil

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.512
as they tried to flee to safety.

00:01:18.016 --> 00:01:19.390
CALEB HOLLOWAY:
We did everything

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:24.970
we could to get as many people
off of there as we could

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.670
and to try to salvage
what we could on the rig.

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.940
Somehow Caleb survived that
day but 11 of his teammates

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:34.310
didn't make it out alive.

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.170
Whenever it finally sunk in that
the 11 guys that were missing,

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.010
that they were all the
guys from the drill crew,

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:45.040
it was very, very
hard for me to accept.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.290
I was not ready to give up,
I wanted to go back out there

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:49.272
and search some more.

00:01:53.367 --> 00:01:55.950
INTERVIEWER 1: The events that
occurred that day haunted Caleb

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.130
long after the catastrophe.

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.000
CALEB HOLLOWAY: I was
on a downward spiral,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.400
it did not get any
better every day

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.320
that I would think about it.

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.990
I was a mess for probably
six months to a year,

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.340
just didn't even know
what I wanted to do,

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.850
where I wanted to
go with my career.

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.090
I wanted to go back out to
the rig but I knew mentally I

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.270
couldn't.

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.020
I missed the rig, I
missed the brotherhood

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:19.772
that we had out there.

00:02:19.772 --> 00:02:21.730
INTERVIEWER 1: And Caleb
wasn't able to go back

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.570
to life on the rig but he
says that his experience has

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.190
prepared him for the
next chapter in life.

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:32.380
He's now a firefighter in his
hometown of Nacogdoches, Texas.

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.360
CALEB HOLLOWAY: I think
the Horizon tragedy

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.530
kind of prepared me
for some of the stuff

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.610
that I'm faced with today.

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.590
We have that fight or flight,
you can either run away

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.450
or you can run and help.

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.430
And I knew I had that
in me to go and help.

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.770
It gave me the confidence
to be able to face

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:54.395
the challenges I face today, or
we face in the fire industry.

00:02:54.395 --> 00:02:57.910
Because when everybody else is
running away we're running in.

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.380
And that's just
something I'm extremely

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.630
proud to be able to do
and trying to impact

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:06.750
people's lives by helping.

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.000
INTERVIEWER 1: In the wake
of a tragedy like this many

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.890
would choose to sit
on the sidelines

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.360
and tap out from life.

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.580
But instead of running
away from his fears

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.560
Caleb chose to run towards them.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.210
As a firefighter he routinely
risks his life to help others.

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:23.350
Since the disaster he made
one courageous decision

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:24.280
after another.

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.990
And as a result, these decisions
may come to define him.

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:29.890
CALEB HOLLOWAY: It's
been such a blessing

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.330
to be able and overcome
the tragedy that happened

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.680
and to be in the
place that I'm at now.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.680
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:50.135 --> 00:03:52.510
INTERVIEWER 1: This episode
is made possible by the movie

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.800
"Deepwater Horizon" based on the
true story of some of the rig

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.280
workers, including Caleb's.

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:59.810
In theaters September 30th.

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:05.530
If you want one more
story, check out

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.040
this episode about
women in Afghanistan

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.720
and their life behind the burka

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.770
INTERVIEWER 2: In the
1960s and early '70s

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:15.340
Afghanistan was often
viewed as more progressive

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.790
than neighboring countries
when it came to women's rights.

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:22.530
Back then women were able to
pursue an education, get a job,

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:23.990
and even vote.

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.550
But when Islamic fundamentalist
group, the Taliban,

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.420
seized control of the
country in the mid '90s,

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:30.597
everything changed.

00:04:30.597 --> 00:04:32.180
