00:00:00.633 --> 00:00:01.467
- How good could

00:00:01.467 --> 00:00:03.834
be unless it's got dragons?

00:00:03.834 --> 00:00:05.600
It's no fantasy unless
you have a dragon.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:06.500
- Yeah, you need the dragon.
- Yeah.

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:07.667
You need the dragons.

00:00:07.667 --> 00:00:10.333
And in my home institution,
the American Museum

00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:13.133
of Natural History, we had
an exhibit a few years ago

00:00:13.133 --> 00:00:17.066
that was all about
mythical monsters

00:00:17.066 --> 00:00:21.800
and whether they
were the imaginations

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.000
of people who discovered
fossils of extinct dinosaurs.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.900
Oh, wow.

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:27.734
Wow.
That's fantastic.

00:00:27.734 --> 00:00:28.700
Yeah.

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.100
So imagine-- you
know a triceratops.

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.433
Yeah.

00:00:31.433 --> 00:00:37.166
Imagine that emerging from
the eroding side of a cliff.

00:00:37.166 --> 00:00:38.400
- That would be pretty--
- Right?

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.667
Pretty freaky.

00:00:39.667 --> 00:00:41.000
Now you clearly know that
the animal you're seeing--

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.200
it's extinct.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.633
But the concept of
extinction is a modern idea--

00:00:44.633 --> 00:00:45.433
Yeah.
Of course.

00:00:45.433 --> 00:00:46.367
--a few hundred years ago.

00:00:46.367 --> 00:00:48.667
So here's this thing.

00:00:48.667 --> 00:00:53.700
It can't-- it must
be some-- a monster

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.033
that we fear in the night.

00:00:55.033 --> 00:00:57.734
And so didn't know about that?

00:00:57.734 --> 00:00:58.767
No, no.

00:00:58.767 --> 00:00:59.767
I've never really
thought about that.

00:00:59.767 --> 00:01:01.734
Yeah!

00:01:01.734 --> 00:01:03.467
I think you love
dragons because they're

00:01:03.467 --> 00:01:05.633
great if they're your
friend, but if they're not,

00:01:05.633 --> 00:01:06.834
they're a superpredator.

00:01:06.834 --> 00:01:08.233
And that's another
theory, actually,

00:01:08.233 --> 00:01:10.700
about where we have this idea
of dragons from that's even more

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.867
ancient than the idea of
people discovering fossils--

00:01:12.867 --> 00:01:14.834
this idea that it might date
back to when we were very

00:01:14.834 --> 00:01:16.433
frightened of apex predators.

00:01:16.433 --> 00:01:18.300
An anthropologist
called David E. Jones

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:19.900
who puts forward this theory.

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.300
He studied vervet
monkeys in Africa.

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.600
And he noticed that
they are particularly

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.500
anxious about three predators--
lions, eagles, and snakes.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.867
And so they have
a particular cry

00:01:29.867 --> 00:01:32.033
that they make when they see
any of these three creatures.

00:01:32.033 --> 00:01:33.233
Really?

00:01:33.233 --> 00:01:35.200
And if you merge those
three creatures together,

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.033
you sort of get something
that resembles a dragon.

00:01:38.033 --> 00:01:40.633
So he again has used
this to theorize--

00:01:40.633 --> 00:01:42.066
So snake just gets you like--

00:01:42.066 --> 00:01:45.533
Is the cry? [bleep]

00:01:45.533 --> 00:01:47.166
Very similar, I think.

00:01:47.166 --> 00:01:47.967
Very similar.

00:01:47.967 --> 00:01:49.100
That's exactly--

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.500
HELEN KEEN (VOICEOVER):
Yeah, it's more or less.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.300
You put it through the monkey
translator, it is so that.

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:53.000
HELEN KEEN (VOICEOVER):
Yeah, that's what comes out.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.667
Yeah.

00:01:54.667 --> 00:01:57.000
So when you think about it, if
you have something as ferocious

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.066
as a lion that has the body type
of a serpent such as the snake,

00:02:02.066 --> 00:02:05.500
but it can fly as a flying
predator such as an eagle--

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.300
yeah, I'll give him that.

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:08.333
So that would be tougher.

00:02:08.333 --> 00:02:09.433
So yes, he has this
idea that we would

00:02:09.433 --> 00:02:11.066
have had this passed
down through millions

00:02:11.066 --> 00:02:12.066
of generations.

00:02:12.066 --> 00:02:13.800
We would have evolved
this fear that's

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.233
so great that we've created--

00:02:15.233 --> 00:02:16.533
NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON
(VOICEOVER): A primal fear.

00:02:16.533 --> 00:02:17.900
--this amalgamation-- yes--
of these three predators.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.133
Where does the
fire part come from?

00:02:19.133 --> 00:02:20.834
We're all scared of-- we
would be scared of fire,

00:02:20.834 --> 00:02:21.934
but that the idea--

00:02:21.934 --> 00:02:23.166
They just added that
after-- say, we want

00:02:23.166 --> 00:02:24.367
to make it even more ferocious.

00:02:24.367 --> 00:02:25.367
ISAAC WRIGHT (VOICEOVER):
Oh, right right, right.
