00:00:00.523 --> 00:00:02.636
- [Voiceover] The goal
of this video is to try

00:00:02.636 --> 00:00:04.826
to compare these two quantities.

00:00:04.826 --> 00:00:07.966
I have 0.17 and I have 0.2,

00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:10.828
and I wanna figure out
which of these two is larger

00:00:10.828 --> 00:00:12.519
or maybe they're equal,
and I encourage you

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:15.201
to pause the video to
try to figure that out.

00:00:15.201 --> 00:00:17.944
One way to do it is to
try to visualize these.

00:00:17.944 --> 00:00:21.535
Each of these large squares
you can view as a whole.

00:00:21.535 --> 00:00:24.719
And this one on the left, I
have it split into 100 smaller

00:00:24.719 --> 00:00:27.245
sections 'cause you
notice we have 10 rows,

00:00:27.245 --> 00:00:30.846
and each row has 10 squares,
so we have 100 squares here.

00:00:30.846 --> 00:00:35.141
So, each of these squares
represents 1/100 of the whole.

00:00:35.141 --> 00:00:37.630
And so this number up here, 0.17,

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:41.168
we could view that as 17/100.

00:00:41.168 --> 00:00:44.499
So let's color in 17/100.

00:00:44.499 --> 00:00:47.974
17/100 is going to be,

00:00:47.974 --> 00:00:52.487
so that's 1/100, two, three, four, five,

00:00:52.487 --> 00:00:56.750
six, seven, eight, nine, 10/100.

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.130
And notice 10/100, I filled
in one out of the 10 rows,

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:02.325
so this is the same thing as 1/10.

00:01:02.325 --> 00:01:06.549
So that's 10/100, 11/100, 12/100,

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:10.077
13, 14, 15, 16, 17.

00:01:10.077 --> 00:01:14.868
So, one way to visualize
0.17, which is 17/100,

00:01:14.868 --> 00:01:18.739
is the fraction of this whole
that is filled in magenta.

00:01:18.739 --> 00:01:20.800
Now what about 0.2?

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.974
0.2 is the same thing as 2/10.

00:01:23.974 --> 00:01:26.881
So we could take our whole
and divide it into 1/10,

00:01:26.881 --> 00:01:30.781
divide it into 10 equal
sections which we've done here.

00:01:30.781 --> 00:01:34.133
Notice each of these
sections is equal to 10/100.

00:01:34.133 --> 00:01:37.385
And that makes sense,
1/10 is equal to 10/100.

00:01:37.385 --> 00:01:39.497
Let's fill in two of them
now 'cause we're dealing

00:01:39.497 --> 00:01:41.216
with 2/10.

00:01:41.216 --> 00:01:43.316
So let's fill in two of them.

00:01:43.316 --> 00:01:46.981
We have 1/10 and 2/10.

00:01:46.981 --> 00:01:51.295
Which of these is larger?

00:01:51.295 --> 00:01:53.901
We see we're filling in more
of the whole when we're doing

00:01:53.901 --> 00:01:58.286
2/10 than when we're doing 17/100.

00:01:58.286 --> 00:02:02.259
And that makes sense because
2/10 is the same thing.

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:04.447
2/10 is the same thing.

00:02:04.447 --> 00:02:06.787
Another way of me saying
2/10 is you could write it

00:02:06.787 --> 00:02:09.291
as 20/100.

00:02:09.291 --> 00:02:11.769
20/100 is greater than 17/100.

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:13.477
To get the 20/100,

00:02:13.477 --> 00:02:15.723
you'd have to fill in these three as well.

00:02:15.723 --> 00:02:17.539
Notice when you fill out those three,

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:20.807
you're filling out the same
fraction of your whole.

00:02:20.807 --> 00:02:23.376
So, which one's larger?

00:02:23.376 --> 00:02:24.696
2/10 is.

00:02:24.696 --> 00:02:26.516
And how do we write that down?

00:02:26.516 --> 00:02:27.999
When we write it in equality,

00:02:27.999 --> 00:02:30.095
we wanna open to the larger number.

00:02:30.095 --> 00:02:31.559
You want to open to that one.

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:34.672
So we have 0.17 or 17/100,

00:02:34.672 --> 00:02:38.039
is less than 2/10.

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:40.221
Now, another way that we
could've tackled this,

00:02:40.221 --> 00:02:43.928
even without having to draw all of this,

00:02:43.928 --> 00:02:47.627
is we could've just gone
to the largest place value.

00:02:47.627 --> 00:02:52.157
So if you went to the one's
place, we have zero ones.

00:02:52.157 --> 00:02:55.182
And we have zero ones here,
so that doesn't help us.

00:02:55.182 --> 00:02:56.670
Then you go to the next largest,

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.129
so you go to the 1/10 place.

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:02.847
Here you have 1/10, here you have 2/10.

00:03:02.847 --> 00:03:05.123
So immediately, without
even looking at what comes

00:03:05.123 --> 00:03:09.107
after this, this could be
0.17358, it could keep going,

00:03:09.107 --> 00:03:12.274
but the bottom line is
you have more 1/10 here

00:03:12.274 --> 00:03:14.921
than you have 1/10 here,
which tells you that this one

00:03:14.921 --> 00:03:19.608
over here is going to be larger.

00:03:19.608 --> 00:03:23.144
So the general thing is, look
at the largest place value.

00:03:23.144 --> 00:03:25.886
If one of the numbers has a larger digit

00:03:25.886 --> 00:03:28.141
in the largest place value,
it's gonna be larger.

00:03:28.141 --> 00:03:31.310
If they're equal, go to the
next larger place value.

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.472
And you could keep going like
that, but another way to think

00:03:33.472 --> 00:03:35.797
about it is just to visualize it,

00:03:35.797 --> 00:03:38.514
just like we did over here.
