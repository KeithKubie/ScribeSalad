00:00:00.633 --> 00:00:01.634
- Like a (racing car sound)

00:00:01.667 --> 00:00:04.237
- Yeah (laughing)

00:00:06.138 --> 00:00:07.540
- Hey guys, this
is the Other Show.

00:00:07.573 --> 00:00:09.075 line:0%
I'm Chris and this is?

00:00:09.108 --> 00:00:10.510 line:0%
- Sarah, hi.

00:00:10.543 --> 00:00:12.178 line:0%
- And we're here to talk
about episode nine which is

00:00:12.211 --> 00:00:14.313 align:start size:97% position:3%
pretty dark, yeah.
- Jason drops his first album.

00:00:14.346 --> 00:00:16.082
- Jason drops his first album.

00:00:16.115 --> 00:00:18.418 align:start size:97% position:3%
It's the plain bottle episode.
- Yes.

00:00:18.451 --> 00:00:20.586
We're here with Drew and
Helene and Molly Shannon.

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:22.655 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
- Whoo, Molly Shannon!
- Yeah.

00:00:22.688 --> 00:00:24.690 align:start size:88% position:13%
- I know you get a
full name at all times.

00:00:24.723 --> 00:00:26.325
- You know if this
plane goes down,

00:00:26.358 --> 00:00:27.760
the headline's gonna read,

00:00:27.793 --> 00:00:30.163 align:start size:94% position:6%
Chase Dreams comma others
die in plane crash.

00:00:30.196 --> 00:00:31.697
We are comma others.

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:33.299 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Well, first of all,
- Yeah.

00:00:33.332 --> 00:00:34.767
- If we were on a
plane, it would say

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.502 align:start size:94% position:6%
Molly Shannon comma
others die in plane crash.

00:00:36.535 --> 00:00:37.537
(laughing)

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:39.238
- Without question.

00:00:39.271 --> 00:00:41.307
- The example that we had
in the show that we cut

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.211 align:start size:88% position:13%
was if Oprah and
Beyonce, this is morbid,

00:00:45.244 --> 00:00:46.646
but were on the same
flight that crashed,

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:47.613 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Jesus.
- [Chris] Who would get

00:00:47.646 --> 00:00:48.748 align:start size:75% position:25%
top billing?
- I think Oprah.

00:00:48.781 --> 00:00:50.483
- I think Oprah, too, right?

00:00:50.516 --> 00:00:52.852 align:start size:97% position:3%
- But what if it was the day
after Formation came out?

00:00:52.885 --> 00:00:54.220 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Ooh.
- [Drew] Very tough.

00:00:55.654 --> 00:00:57.090 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Wait, somebody in
the writer's room said

00:00:57.123 --> 00:00:57.757
that they would put out
two different editions

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.225
of the paper that day.

00:00:59.258 --> 00:01:00.726
- [All in Unison]
Yeah (laughing)

00:01:00.759 --> 00:01:01.527
- Like collector's editions
where you'd get to choose

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:02.228
whose your top billing.

00:01:02.261 --> 00:01:02.862
- Yeah, yeah.

00:01:02.895 --> 00:01:04.797
- Can Oprah die?

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.833 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Oh (laughing).
- That's a good question.

00:01:06.866 --> 00:01:09.402 align:start size:84% position:16%
- [Girls] Chase,
Chase, Chase, Chase.

00:01:09.435 --> 00:01:10.636
(screaming)

00:01:10.669 --> 00:01:12.205 align:start size:84% position:16%
- So we shot this
episode for four days,

00:01:12.238 --> 00:01:14.674
and we had a bunch
of kids on the plane

00:01:14.707 --> 00:01:17.343
but not all kids could
come for all four days.

00:01:17.376 --> 00:01:18.845
They were only allowed to
I guess to legally work

00:01:18.878 --> 00:01:20.346
for two days, or something.

00:01:20.379 --> 00:01:22.682
So they hired only twins.

00:01:22.715 --> 00:01:24.584
- Only identical twins.

00:01:24.617 --> 00:01:26.219
- [Chris] So everybody on the
plane is an identical twin,

00:01:26.252 --> 00:01:28.588
So in acts one and
two, it's one twin

00:01:28.621 --> 00:01:30.723 align:start size:94% position:6%
and then in act three,
where you start screaming,

00:01:30.756 --> 00:01:31.891
it's their twin.

00:01:31.924 --> 00:01:33.593
- Whoa.

00:01:33.626 --> 00:01:35.261 align:start size:94% position:6%
- That's crazy cause we
got to there we were like,

00:01:35.294 --> 00:01:38.598 align:start size:94% position:6%
hi, like we knew them
and they were like, "hi".

00:01:38.631 --> 00:01:39.832 align:start size:84% position:16%
- One twin is gonna
be like, I don't know,

00:01:39.865 --> 00:01:40.900 align:start size:84% position:16%
it's like a fun party
and the other one

00:01:40.933 --> 00:01:42.602
is gonna be like, are you sure?

00:01:42.635 --> 00:01:46.239 align:start size:97% position:3%
This woman was just screaming
about her husband's dick.

00:01:46.272 --> 00:01:48.241
Is this the same show?

00:01:48.274 --> 00:01:50.576
- So you what I
think might help?

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:51.744 align:start size:75% position:25%
- Helen.
(pig screaming)

00:01:51.777 --> 00:01:53.479
- I don't want to hold your pig.

00:01:53.512 --> 00:01:55.281
- Okay well can you, because
she's getting really heavy?

00:01:55.314 --> 00:01:57.583
- As soon as I held
Helen, it screamed.

00:01:57.616 --> 00:02:00.453
It could just tell I
had bad energy maybe.

00:02:00.486 --> 00:02:02.889
- Ken was kind of like,
the Helen whisperer.

00:02:02.922 --> 00:02:04.323 align:start size:81% position:19%
And Kate was like
- Yeah.

00:02:04.356 --> 00:02:05.791
- Putty in his hands
and then the hand off

00:02:05.824 --> 00:02:07.493
would happen and the
screaming would begin.

00:02:07.526 --> 00:02:09.395
(laughing)

00:02:09.428 --> 00:02:10.763
- The pig was very happy,
very well taken care of.

00:02:10.796 --> 00:02:12.865 align:start size:75% position:25%
- Yes it was.
- Yes of course.

00:02:12.898 --> 00:02:14.400 align:start size:84% position:16%
- And the pig's owner
was really nice.

00:02:14.433 --> 00:02:16.235
I got, I became very
friendly with her.

00:02:16.268 --> 00:02:18.304 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Yeah.
- We texted one another.

00:02:18.337 --> 00:02:20.540
- We had one experience
on SNL where we needed

00:02:20.573 --> 00:02:22.808 align:start size:84% position:16%
a squirrel, and this
handler was like

00:02:22.841 --> 00:02:25.211 align:start position:0%
"Yes, I have a trained squirrel
and we'll bring it to you.

00:02:25.244 --> 00:02:26.646
"The squirrel does what I say.

00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:27.947
"It will do whatever you need."

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.582
- And also, you really
have to shoot at night

00:02:29.615 --> 00:02:30.850 align:start size:97% position:3%
because the squirrel is
driving down from the capital.

00:02:30.883 --> 00:02:32.318
(laughing)

00:02:32.351 --> 00:02:33.719
- So it was eight
hours in a truck.

00:02:33.752 --> 00:02:36.422 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Driven down, the squirrel
was put on its mark,

00:02:36.455 --> 00:02:38.357
the camera started rolling,

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.693 align:start size:97% position:3%
the squirrel immediately
just ran up into the rafters,

00:02:40.726 --> 00:02:42.295
(laughing)

00:02:42.328 --> 00:02:43.763 align:start size:94% position:6%
- And then the squirrel's
trainer was like,

00:02:43.796 --> 00:02:45.865
"We just have to wait
for it to come down."

00:02:45.898 --> 00:02:47.233
(laughing)

00:02:47.266 --> 00:02:49.669
- She was like, "What do we do?

00:02:49.702 --> 00:02:50.970
"What should we do?"

00:02:51.003 --> 00:02:52.738
We were like, "I don't
know what should we do?"

00:02:52.771 --> 00:02:55.508
(laughing)

00:02:55.541 --> 00:02:56.642 align:start position:0%
- They were sort of like,
"Well, you know with a squirrel,

00:02:56.676 --> 00:02:58.511 align:start size:97% position:3%
you know, you can train
it, but you also just like,

00:02:58.544 --> 00:02:59.445
you actually can't."

00:02:59.478 --> 00:03:00.646
(laughing)

00:03:00.679 --> 00:03:02.515
- You actually can't.

00:03:02.548 --> 00:03:03.483 align:start size:97% position:3%
- It's a wild animal so
it's gonna do what it wants.

00:03:03.516 --> 00:03:04.450 align:start size:84% position:16%
- You can train it,
but on the other hand,

00:03:04.483 --> 00:03:05.318
you cannot train it.

00:03:05.351 --> 00:03:06.819
(laughing)

00:03:06.852 --> 00:03:08.387
- I'm not gonna tell Chase.

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:09.655 align:start size:84% position:16%
And starting tomorrow,
my name's Roberta,

00:03:09.688 --> 00:03:11.357
you're Felicia, Carrie's Dante,

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:13.526 align:start size:84% position:16%
Chase is Miguel, we
move to South America,

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:14.961 align:start size:72% position:28%
we start over.
- What?

00:03:14.994 --> 00:03:17.530 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I think my favorite
scenes to shoot

00:03:17.563 --> 00:03:19.498
were the scenes that we
went into the bathroom.

00:03:19.531 --> 00:03:21.834
So like watch Molly
slowly disintegrate.

00:03:21.867 --> 00:03:23.336
- [Chris] Yeah.

00:03:23.369 --> 00:03:25.538
- But we would do them
out of order and stuff

00:03:25.571 --> 00:03:27.773
and you're so amazing in it.

00:03:27.806 --> 00:03:29.475
- Yeah.

00:03:29.508 --> 00:03:30.710
- And all of us falling
apart at different times.

00:03:30.743 --> 00:03:32.778
But like watching
you sort of like

00:03:32.811 --> 00:03:35.381
have the veneer come
off is really awesome.

00:03:35.414 --> 00:03:37.416
- That was a big
chunk to memorize.

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:39.385
And we were shooting
you know in New York,

00:03:39.418 --> 00:03:42.455
and I stayed at a, I
think it was a Hilton,

00:03:42.488 --> 00:03:43.889
to memorize my monologue.

00:03:43.922 --> 00:03:47.727 align:start size:97% position:3%
I went swimming and there
was like a glass like window,

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.895
so there was a prom going
on while I was memorizing.

00:03:49.928 --> 00:03:51.731
So I was swimming,
memorizing my lines,

00:03:51.764 --> 00:03:53.332
waiving to people
like at a prom.

00:03:53.365 --> 00:03:54.533 align:start size:84% position:16%
- [Sarah] For real?
(laughing)

00:03:54.566 --> 00:03:56.035
- Dragging that scene.

00:03:56.068 --> 00:03:57.737
(laughing)

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:59.038
- Molly Shannon is swimming
and screaming to herself?

00:03:59.071 --> 00:03:59.972 align:start size:84% position:16%
- And I swam for so
long because there was

00:04:00.006 --> 00:04:00.873
so much to memorize
that when I got out

00:04:00.906 --> 00:04:02.908 align:start size:84% position:16%
I had a charley
horse, and I was like,

00:04:02.941 --> 00:04:04.977 align:start size:84% position:16%
I hope the prom
people don't see me.

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:06.846
(laughing)

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:08.881
- I had to scoot up to the.

00:04:08.914 --> 00:04:09.882 align:start size:84% position:16%
- That's going to
be their prom story.

00:04:09.915 --> 00:04:11.284
They're gonna be
like, at my prom

00:04:11.317 --> 00:04:12.752
I went to a dance and
I saw Molly Shannon

00:04:12.785 --> 00:04:15.955 align:start size:88% position:13%
coming out of a pool,
just like falling apart.

00:04:15.988 --> 00:04:17.723
- So let's all have a laugh.

00:04:17.756 --> 00:04:19.925
Let's all laugh at
my dead husband.

00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:22.295 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Molly no one's
laughing, it's okay.

00:04:22.328 --> 00:04:23.829
- He was the only
man I ever loved.

00:04:23.862 --> 00:04:26.365 align:start size:81% position:19%
I did not want him to
be a ***ing joke.

00:04:26.398 --> 00:04:28.501 align:start size:88% position:13%
- In the first episode,
it says I miss Dad,

00:04:28.534 --> 00:04:29.702
and we were like yeah,
and I know I did too.

00:04:29.735 --> 00:04:30.903 align:start size:84% position:16%
But we didn't decide
what that meant.

00:04:30.936 --> 00:04:32.338
- Yeah.

00:04:32.371 --> 00:04:33.539
- It's so it was
like fun to figure

00:04:33.572 --> 00:04:34.073 align:start size:84% position:16%
out in the room what
happened to him.

00:04:34.106 --> 00:04:35.675
- Yeah.

00:04:35.708 --> 00:04:37.410 align:start size:97% position:3%
- We also went back through,
kind of when we were

00:04:37.443 --> 00:04:39.345
towards the end, and
added the year of yes

00:04:39.378 --> 00:04:40.780
for a line for Pat's character.

00:04:40.813 --> 00:04:42.848
That was kind of like
a later in the game.

00:04:42.881 --> 00:04:44.517 align:start size:84% position:16%
Because we really
liked this idea that

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.720
we've seen her existing
through this whole season

00:04:47.753 --> 00:04:50.056 align:start size:84% position:16%
kind of like
repressing and making

00:04:50.089 --> 00:04:51.557
this new narrative for herself

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:54.794
as like a gung ho
woman going for it.

00:04:54.827 --> 00:04:56.962 align:start size:88% position:13%
And then in this episode
where she finally

00:04:56.995 --> 00:04:59.799
let's that go the side,
it's very satisfying

00:04:59.832 --> 00:05:01.934
to see that woman give it up.

00:05:01.967 --> 00:05:03.336
- [Cast In Unison] Yeah.

00:05:03.369 --> 00:05:04.904
- I love the part
where she's like

00:05:04.937 --> 00:05:06.939 align:start size:97% position:3%
where she just says,
explains why she didn't want

00:05:06.972 --> 00:05:08.107
to tell Chase that
she's just like,

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:09.875
I just want him
to have a chance.

00:05:09.908 --> 00:05:12.345
It's like so heartbreaking.

00:05:12.378 --> 00:05:14.547 align:start size:97% position:3%
And then I just loved how
dignified she is with the way

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:19.385
she sees him, how hard he
did try and so respectful.

00:05:20.786 --> 00:05:22.822
And I guess being
an Irish Catholic

00:05:22.855 --> 00:05:26.525
with a long history of
alcoholics in my family

00:05:26.558 --> 00:05:29.428
I just felt like it was
just ****ing beautiful.

00:05:29.461 --> 00:05:30.730
- I didn't want to give a
sheet or it to be a joke,

00:05:30.763 --> 00:05:32.131
I didn't want like
people to decide

- No
- [Chris] Who he was for him.

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:34.834
