00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.011
If you look in
the GifEditorViewController in the

00:00:03.011 --> 00:00:07.568
Objective-C project you'll notice that
there's a property for a gifImageView.

00:00:07.568 --> 00:00:12.526
Go ahead and add this property in your
GifEditorViewController.swift file,

00:00:12.526 --> 00:00:15.720
and connect it to
the gifImageView in Storyboard.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.967
We're also going to add
a property to hold the gifURL and

00:00:18.967 --> 00:00:22.830
that property will be
an optional of type NSURL.

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.060
We'll set it to nil for now.

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.180
Once you've got the gifURL set up,

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.820
we're going to want to add some
code to the method viewWillAppear.

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.920
This code will render
the gifURL as a gif.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.779
Kind of like we did in
the WelcomeViewController,

00:00:36.779 --> 00:00:40.776
we'll make a GIF from the recording
by calling the method gifWithURL.

00:00:40.776 --> 00:00:45.060
And notice that gifWithURL
takes a string as a parameter.

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:50.639
So we'll need to use the absoluteString
property of our NSURL.

00:00:50.639 --> 00:00:54.951
And then we'll load that
image into the gifImageView.

00:00:54.951 --> 00:00:59.880
And, of course, let's not forget
to call super.viewWillAppear.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.150
With these life cycle methods, we
always have to remember to call super.

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.469
Back in our
UIViewController+Record extension,

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:13.787
we'll instantiate an instance of
the GIF editor, add our GIF URL and

00:01:13.787 --> 00:01:17.250
then push that on to
the navigation stack.

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.040
We're going to do all of that
in a method called displayGIF.

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.630
So first we instantiate our
GifEditorViewController,

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:31.130
pass it the gifURL and
then push it on to the navigation stack.

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.450
And, of course,
we'll want to call the method displayGIF

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.050
from the method convertVideoToGIF so
that we can pass it the gifURL

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:43.600
we just got from regift and
we won't forget to unwrap it.

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.890
We're also going to need to call this
convertVideoToGIF method somewhere,

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.460
we can do that up in
didFinishPickingMediaWithInfo.

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.590
Remember we were just saving
the video to the photo album,

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.900
instead we'll just
call convertVideoToGIF.

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:03.450
And now we'll run it.

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:06.490
So let's see how it looks.

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:11.630
Here comes the camera, there's my
video producer seeing how many malt

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.200
balls he can stuff in his mouth, the
camera dismisses and there's our GIF.
