 Hi everyone, I'm the Navy's grandson. 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.750
 dunga team by google launches at 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.940
 today's episode 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.199
 Let's see how to use a side menu 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:21.210
 with the layout in your android app 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:23.609
 19 drug complaint is a panel that displays 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.099
 the main navigation areas in the 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.109
 left side over captive is a 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.300
 panel that is hidden for the most part 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.800
 of time but exhibiting with the user 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.770
 pass from left to right with 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.489
 your hands on the casserole or touch the 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.230
 epe 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.000
 if it is available it is easy 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.640
 identify who will have it three lists 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.079
 side of the icon that will give the invention 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.110
 episode that he can click there and 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.629
 access your drug drug wants with 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:52.289
 drug layout and one more important thing 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:54.570
 consider deciding and implementing 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.120
 this wai pattern we need to understand the 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.460
 cases of use and some considerations 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.440
 on design in the use of the name of 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.939
 shannon brown hertha but let's give a 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.560
 look when using drug drug 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:09.600
 for example more than three levels 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.070
 main navigation 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.680
 so I only have the various levels of 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.170
 navigation with views top on my part 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.880
 mediation it is important to be able to use 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.950
 Remember drugs if you have 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.869
 three levels it is recommended that you 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.020
 uses fixed telephones, for example 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.850
 they make navigation simpler and easier 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.159
 fast the sun is already seeing him 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.729
 the three options he can already click and 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.860
 easily switch navigation between 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.229
 different secondary levels of 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.490
 application content for example has 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.990
 many categories 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.540
 I do not feel a certain category in 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.490
 subcategories you can in a way 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.649
 Quick select those boos 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.720
 subcategories and if you put too much up to be 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.369
 use ends up being lost that much has a 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.509
 side to the other even using the 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:56.939
 tags with utah scroll or very levels 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.219
 deep navigation in one of the options 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.049
 you have one of the navigation areas is 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.450
 very deep and a young man stayed 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.640
 come back come back and this may end 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.380
 impairing application skills 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.479
 and by placing navigation drug it can 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.580
 direct he chose a level that he 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.530
 want to go back then use this 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.740
 investiture as a national guide 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.060
 the action that makes it very easy but also 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.800
 has other considerations which is very 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.200
 important you visit someone's design 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.959
 to orient well when they are good 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.850
 recommendations use it is good and as 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:30.000
 which I then create navigation drug 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:31.709
 using a good first draw and layout 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.930
 that you will use in this example 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:36.420
 free support so you can then 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.700
 have the layout available in the 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.950
 previous android 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:44.670
 ok then I have to do is declare 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:47.250
 a main interface interface of your 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:50.459
 activity and having as root 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.500
 the droid out because it will contain all the 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:54.780
 content under its 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.330
 after that he added a ship then 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.650
 to the main content of the screen that is 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.540
 where you will place the flagrante 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.360
 example with different contents 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.910
 views and a specific part of the content 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.019
 navigation drug kelly the panel that goes 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.840
 be shown 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:11.730
 It's an example of him I think we have 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:15.120
 here I am using a civil junk 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:17.670
 on then we here the main heard the 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:20.250
 stockholm layout troller observing the 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:22.019
 support we have up to a frame layout 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.730
 that's where I'm going to put the contents 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:27.299
 to be content where I am going to do 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:28.920
 the placement of the flagrant and below the 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:31.260
 garbage and saw that exactly where you will get the 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:34.410
 content number 9 leaving drug 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:37.200
 Okay good and how will I treat them then? 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:39.810
 clicks on them require navigation 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.850
 as I gave the example of the list here I 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.609
 I'm using the interface list 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:47.250
 saw item the item click list is for 

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:50.160
 when I click on one of the items it can 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.840
 then trigger a specific action that 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.359
 I know the first thing to create a 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.820
 fragment you want to display later 

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:58.470
 use the mg fragment so that it 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:00.450
 make the exchange of the content being 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:03.590
 displayed by the option that the user 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:05.970
 selected our friends then 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.950
 update the highlight on the list that I 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:10.320
 can I give populated feedback where it 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:13.980
 is in the position at which moment and of course 

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:16.470
 close the trolley out good and how can i 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:18.510
 do to open and close using a 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:20.220
 application icon that is very cool the 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:22.200
 applications usually do this so the 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:25.110
 eyes already identifies that he can 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:27.090
 clicking on the icon opens this code 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.460
 small screen it goes to 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:32.040
 its a customer of your tivit where I 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:35.370
 I'll create an action power object 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:38.040
 turbo informing him face activity 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:40.199
 or who will have that drug or 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:41.639
 drug and layout you've created people 

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:44.040
 because the former ide 

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:47.610
 the icon to replace the op navigation 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:49.470
 The description for the pib is cloud and there 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:51.930
 how come it's a classic of a koubek 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:54.780
 we have shoulder to icloud that is called 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:56.850
 when its completely closed 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:58.199
 and a drop that is called when it is 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:00.240
 fully open 

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:02.310
 in this example we are defining the 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:05.250
 action bar in accordance with the 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:07.440
 open or close the draw and there 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:11.490
 so that we can make it 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:13.410
 Raining and interacting with the drug 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:15.630
 and layout is using 17 illicit drug 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:18.360
 so we're going to cause that 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:20.389
 they interact well and with that then the 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:23.490
 that is, from now on 

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:25.770
 use another layout in your 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:28.080
 application and now try a menu 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:30.840
 left side which leaves excellent 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:32.700
 browsing your user 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:34.410
 remember to arrive at the description of the 

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:37.410
 where you will have a link that you 

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:39.270
 official documentation and there will be 

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:41.639
 a complete example of how you can 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:42.840
 implement the drogba navigation launched 

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:46.370
 android app 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:46.370
 Thank you very much and see you next time.
