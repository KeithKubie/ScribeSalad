00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.767
It's important to note that although some people experience negative

00:00:03.767 --> 00:00:08.070
consequences for using LSD or similar drug. Some researchers have found that

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:12.420
these drugs actually are really beneficial medications for some conditions. In

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.420
fact, this has led some of the top researchers in the field to examine the

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.595
beneficial therapeutic effects of these drugs.

00:00:18.595 --> 00:00:22.020
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; That's right. For example, LSD has been used in the treatment of cluster

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.210
headaches and there's new research looking at LSD for treating drug dependence.

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.549
However, it's important to note that LSD is a schedule one drug, which means

00:00:30.549 --> 00:00:34.465
there are serious consequences for both use and possession.

00:00:34.465 --> 00:00:37.131
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; But who better to tell us about all this than two world-renowned experts in

00:00:37.131 --> 00:00:40.800
their field. First, we're going to talk to Doctor Griffiths about his research

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.986
with psilocybin. Right, and then we'll come back and talk to Doctor Doblin, who

00:00:44.986 --> 00:00:49.670
is the founder of the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Science.

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.700
He's going to discuss MDMA or Ecstasy with us.
