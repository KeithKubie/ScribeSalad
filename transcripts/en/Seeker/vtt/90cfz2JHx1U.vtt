00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:07.750
Imagination is so important to the development
of our species, can you imagine what it would

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:15.320
be like if we couldn’t imagine things?

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.619
Whoaaaaaaa.

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:21.830
Hello out there in imagination land, I’m
Julian and this is DNews.

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.090
The human brain is so amazing that we often
take for granted just how special it is.

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:30.090
Our ability to think creatively to solve problems
makes us a force to be reckoned with.

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.220
It’s also enriched our lives giving us music
and art.

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.110
But it’s something we can do at a level
almost no other creatures on earth can, so

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.080
why are we so special?

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:43.230
According to Steven Mithen, an anthropologist
who specialises in the evolution of the mind

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.290
at the University of Reading, we went through
7 steps on the way to being human that let

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.540
us have and harness our imagination.

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:54.360
The first step, Mithen says, was developed
waaaay back, about 3 and a half million years

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.360
ago.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:00.400
Technically there weren’t people yet but
australopithecus, and they started understanding

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:05.210
the Theory of Mind right around the same time
Panama was settling into place.

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.469
Theory of Mind is the ability to understand
that other creatures have thoughts and beliefs

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:11.080
that may be different to our own.

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.770
Though after spending 5 minutes on the internet,
I’m not so sure everyone has this ability.

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.829
The next big development came thanks to Homo
habilis’ long path to adulthood.

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:24.820
Researchers think a lengthy childhood and
adolescence means they, and by extension we,

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.390
have a long time to learn and play without
adult responsibilities getting in the way.

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.109
It’s called Human Life History.

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:34.040
It’s also the best excuse ever for not leaving
college.

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.259
Mithen credits Homo erectus with developing
Specialized Intelligence about a million years

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:39.259
ago.

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:43.119
Now our ancestors could build specific thoughts
into more complex ideas and start to compare

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:45.810
them to other thoughts to form new ideas.

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.380
Homo sapiens had finally come onto the scene
about 200 thousand years ago, and they developed

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.280
the final four leaps to imagination within
the last 10 thousand to hundred thousand years,

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.499
depending who you ask.

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:57.909
It starts with Language.

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:02.250
Now we can assign sounds to concrete objects
and abstract ideas.

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.329
This leads to Cognitive Fluidity, where we
can use metaphors and symbols to help us understand

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:08.380
and explain an idea.

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.330
Those developments segue nicely into step
6.

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:16.270
Now we can clearly communicate an idea to
someone else, and they can add their brain

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:17.310
power to the equation.

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.500
Mithen calls it the extended mind.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.300
Sharing information and ideas helps them grow
and change.

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:27.030
It’s why, in my opinion, the internet is
the single greatest invention ever.

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.020
Aside from sliced bread, obviously.

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.480
Finally modern humans could put all this to
use when they developed farming that produced

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:33.700
a surplus of food.

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.790
Now that we weren’t moving around all the
time and trying to solve our daily problems

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.200
of finding food and shelter, we could turn
our collective imaginations towards thinking

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.030
of new inventions or creative pursuits like
art.

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.980
And being able to imagine things that seem
impossible challenges us to find ways to make

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:48.980
it real.

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.910
Like how in Star Trek 40 years ago they all
had communicators long before the cell phone

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:53.950
was invented.

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:57.460
Of course, because they had to keep the plot
going, Star Trek writers also imagined something

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:59.760
else that ended up happening; no reception.

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.320
Thanks, Star Trek.

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.650
If you want to learn more ways language advanced
the human race, Tara looks into that for you

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:06.650
here.

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.160
And what’s an idea you want to get the collective
might of the human network behind?

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.460
