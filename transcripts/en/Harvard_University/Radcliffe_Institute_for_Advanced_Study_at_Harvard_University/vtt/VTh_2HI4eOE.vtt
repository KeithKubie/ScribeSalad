00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.982
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.952 --> 00:00:09.722
-Good afternoon, everyone.

00:00:09.722 --> 00:00:10.850
I'm Liz Cohen.

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:14.100
I'm Dean of the Radcliffe
Institute for Advanced Study.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.660
And I couldn't be happier
to welcome all of you

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:21.420
to a unique format today for
this year's Rama S. Mehta

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.230
program, entitled "Families in
Flight-- Today's International

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.170
Refugee Crisis".

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.619
The Rama S. Mehta Lecture was
established by the late John

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.360
Kenneth Galbraith and
Catherine Atwater Galbraith

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.120
in memory of Rama S. Mehta, a
scholar of modern Indian family

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.280
life.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.380
I'm pleased to welcome the
Galbraiths' son, Ambassador

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.900
Peter Galbraith, who's
sitting here in the front row.

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.840
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.600
Along with two of Rama
Mehta's granddaughters,

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.138
[? Molika ?] Mehta and
[? Ahilia ?] Mehta.

00:00:59.138 --> 00:00:59.638
Since--

00:00:59.638 --> 00:01:01.534
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:03.500
Right there.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:04.721
There they are, over there.

00:01:04.721 --> 00:01:05.220
Great.

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.740
Well, we're just so happy
to have you all here.

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.570
Since 1981, the
Mehta lecture has

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.700
brought distinguished
public figures to Cambridge

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.690
to address pressing
contemporary issues concerning

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.080
women in the developing world.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.010
It would be hard to think
of a more urgent issue today

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.010
than the global refugee crisis.

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:30.530
At the end of 2014,
the UN estimated

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.550
that one out of every
122 people on earth

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:39.970
was displaced and
seeking refuge or asylum.

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.380
We are fortunate to have a
distinguished panel of experts

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.940
to address this critical
subject with us today.

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.750
I think the fact that
so many of you are here

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.290
is a testament to how important
we all know this issue is.

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:58.310
I especially want to welcome
members of the classes of 1971,

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.970
1976, and 1986.

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.280
These are Harvard
classes who have returned

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.120
to Harvard for their reunions.

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.360
Welcome also to members
of the Class of 1962,

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.620
who will celebrate
their reunion in May.

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.240
I'd like to thank
the Harvard Alumni

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.770
Association for its partnership
in today's event, which has

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.780
made your presence possible.

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.770
As Harvard's Institute
for Advanced Study,

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.820
Radcliffe fosters
interdisciplinary inquiry

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.430
into important and
multifaceted subjects.

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.530
We bring together
leading thinkers

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.340
from across the Harvard
campus and around the world

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.720
to investigate questions that
transcend any one Harvard

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.960
school or any one discipline.

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.220
And we are committed to
sharing innovative work

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.490
with the broadest community
possible through public events

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:52.290
like this one today,
and many others.

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.000
For example, we will hold
an annual science symposium.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.900
This year it's
entitled "From Sea

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.250
to Changing Sea-- A Science
Symposium About Oceans", which

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.040
will take place on Friday,
October 28th at 9 o'clock,

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.940
right here in this room
in the Knafel Center.

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.990
The calendar cards
on your chairs

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.670
list many more events
coming up this fall.

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:15.530
I hope you'll join us
for as many of them

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:17.900
as you can, either
here in Cambridge

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.580
or through our website, where
we livestream many of our events

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:27.030
and we post videos of
more of them afterwards.

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.020
You can also use the website
to register for events.

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:33.670
Our programs are always
free and open to the public,

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.650
but we do request
that you register

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.510
so we can provide the most
comfortable accommodations.

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.470
Our events and all of our
work here at Radcliffe

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:46.290
depends on the generosity
of our supporters.

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.680
I'm grateful to the donors from
every Radcliffe and Harvard

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.880
class who make it possible
for the Radcliffe Institute

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:58.020
to probe deeply and share
widely our inquiry into the most

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.420
vital world issues.

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:06.260
So just why is the refugee
question so urgent today?

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:10.260
Displacement, after all,
is an ageless problem.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.990
One of the world's most
ancient written stories

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:16.149
is about exiles journeying
through the desert for 40

00:04:16.149 --> 00:04:19.959
years, and numerous oral
traditions similarly

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:25.570
locate their society's origins
in banishment and wandering.

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:28.970
The refugee crisis of the
20th and 21st centuries,

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:34.150
however, are truly something
new and different under the sun.

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:37.590
Our modern category
of refugee status

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.030
only emerged with the
rise of the nation

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:42.960
state, which by
definition created

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.150
its opposite statelessness.

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:48.790
The first people to
be uprooted by war

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:52.280
and identified as refugees
with a claim on the conscience

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:56.900
of the world were Belgians
in World War I. Sadly,

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:00.480
not many years later, even
more massive numbers of people

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:03.430
were displaced by World
War II, heightening

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:07.040
worldwide sensitivity to the
need for systematic refugee

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:10.060
relief, and inspiring
the United Nations

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:14.700
to issue the Declaration
of Human Rights in 1948.

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:19.350
But official coordinated relief
operations took two more years

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:20.720
to materialize.

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:23.600
The United Nations High
Commission for Refugees,

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:27.930
the UNHCR, was
established in 1950.

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:32.080
The first emergency that
the UNHCR responded to

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.840
was the Hungarian
uprising of 1956,

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:38.790
an event within the
lifetime and memory of some

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:40.740
of the people in this room.

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:44.860
Today, there are more
than 65 million forcibly

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:47.260
displaced people worldwide.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:52.190
Nearly 34,000 people flee
their homes each day.

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:55.330
Most of them seek
refuge somewhere

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:58.110
in Africa or the Middle East.

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:03.830
Fewer than 20% enter
Europe or the Americas.

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:06.470
About 80% of the
world's refugees

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:08.450
are women and children.

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:11.130
Let's look closely
at one example

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:13.930
for a better sense of
exactly what displacement

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:15.490
means for them.

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:18.230
Drought and war in
Somalia robbed a woman

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:21.260
named Isha and her family
of the livestock that

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.470
had once made them prosperous.

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:27.510
When they had nothing left,
Isha and her five young children

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:30.140
walked through the
desert to Dadaab,

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:33.250
62 miles inside
the Kenyan border.

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:36.350
By the time they arrived, the
skin of the children's feet

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:39.140
had been entirely worn away.

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:45.110
Dadaab opened in 1991 as a
temporary camp for the 90,000

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:49.400
Somalis that the UN estimated
would be uprooted by warfare

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:51.180
in their home country.

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:56.480
Today, Dadaab houses nearly half
a million people-- Sudanese,

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:59.010
Ethiopians, Congolese,
and Ugandans,

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:02.930
as well as Somalis-- making
it the third largest city

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:05.200
population-wise in Kenya.

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:09.700
It has schools, hospitals,
and a commercial economy.

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:12.700
But camps themselves
are problematic.

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:15.660
Infectious disease,
supply shortages,

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:18.800
and gender-based
violence run rampant.

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:22.670
Camps also require toleration
by their host countries,

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:25.880
and that tolerance
may not last forever.

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:28.740
The Kenyan government, in
fact, has announced plans

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:30.710
to close Dadaab.

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:33.460
The current president of the
International Rescue Commission

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:36.380
recommends that
camps be replaced

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:39.120
with greater support
to host countries

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:43.620
to integrate newcomers into the
mainstream of their societies.

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:47.690
Yet recent events in Europe, not
to mention our own government's

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:50.970
response to migrants
crossing our southern border,

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:56.350
show that hopes for a warmer
welcome may not be realistic.

00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:59.550
The most pressing refugee
crisis in recent months

00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:03.940
has been the one created by the
violent unrest in Syria, which

00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:09.190
has resulted in 13
million Syrian refugees.

00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:12.350
In today's panel, experts
close to that crisis

00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:14.830
will share their
expertise and insight

00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:18.740
into this crisis and other
refugee situations with us.

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:22.490
Notably, one of our
panelists is a photographer,

00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:25.010
a testament to
Radcliffe's commitment

00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:28.380
to the arts as contributing
in crucial ways

00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:30.660
to deeper knowledge
and understanding

00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:33.570
of important issues
like this one.

00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:35.890
So here's how the
day is going to work.

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:38.890
Jacqueline Bhabha will
introduce the participants

00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:41.590
and moderate the discussion.

00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:44.690
Jackie is a professor of the
Practice of Health and Human

00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:47.950
Rights at the Harvard TH
Chan School of Public Health,

00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:51.840
and Director of Research at the
FHB Center for Health and Human

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:53.290
Rights here at Harvard.

00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:56.090
And I have to say, she
is also a great friend

00:08:56.090 --> 00:08:58.100
of the Radcliffe Institute.

00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:00.910
The panel will conclude with
a question and answer period.

00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:04.210
We'll be setting up a
microphone in the center aisle.

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:06.570
I ask if you have a
question that you step up

00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:07.320
to the microphone.

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:09.420
There'll be a line behind it.

00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:13.380
Introduce yourself and
then ask your question.

00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:16.350
After the panel, I
hope you will join us

00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:19.850
for our continued discussion
at a reception in Faye

00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:22.620
House, which is our main
administrative building here

00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:25.700
at the Radcliffe
Institute, right next door.

00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:28.130
Once again, thank you
so much for coming.

00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:30.735
And now join me in
welcoming Jackie Bhabha.

00:09:30.735 --> 00:09:32.910
[APPLAUSE]

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:41.975
-Hello, and welcome.

00:09:41.975 --> 00:09:49.250
Liz, thank you so much for your
very erudite and appropriate

00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:50.770
introduction.

00:09:50.770 --> 00:09:54.400
Radcliffe always
manages to choose

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:57.560
topics which are really
of critical importance

00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:00.260
to many of us at the University.

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.430
And as you said, you
span many disciplines,

00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:04.550
but you always seem to
hit the nail on the head.

00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:06.600
So congratulations
for choosing something

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:11.410
which I think touches
so many of us so deeply,

00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:13.900
and that we're also
concerned about.

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:16.520
Thank you also for
putting together

00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:18.060
a really wonderful panel.

00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:20.720
I think the expertise
on the panel,

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:23.930
as you will hear in a second,
and the range of experiences

00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:25.620
that people will
bring to it, are going

00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:27.676
to enrich our conversation.

00:10:27.676 --> 00:10:29.050
I just wanted to
make, and I know

00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:31.679
this is-- going to be
very concise, so don't

00:10:31.679 --> 00:10:32.720
worry about the schedule.

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:35.050
But I just wanted to make
three very brief points

00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:37.440
before I introduce our panel.

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:41.090
First, to say that even
though our title today is

00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:44.680
"Families in Flight", I'm sure
we're all aware of the fact

00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:47.660
that many, many of those
fleeing are regrettably

00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:50.070
not in families, they're alone.

00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:52.207
They've either lost the
rest of their family,

00:10:52.207 --> 00:10:54.040
or they've been separated
from their family,

00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:56.000
or they've been sent
alone by their family.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.580
So as we think
about this problem,

00:10:57.580 --> 00:10:59.920
and as our colleagues
address it,

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:01.880
I think it's
important to realize

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:06.860
how fraught the social
context is, not only because

00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:09.140
of the displacement, but
also because of the loss

00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:12.440
of the surrounding
familiar environment.

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:14.270
The second point I
wanted to make briefly

00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:16.269
is-- and I'm very glad
you mentioned this, Liz--

00:11:16.269 --> 00:11:18.520
that we are all so
focused, rightly,

00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:22.590
on the tragedy unfolding every
day in Syria, and in Aleppo

00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:25.010
at the moment, in particular,
but of course, there

00:11:25.010 --> 00:11:29.410
are extraordinarily serious
refugee crises elsewhere, too,

00:11:29.410 --> 00:11:30.380
which we neglect.

00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:33.540
So South Sudan, for
example, the newest member

00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:37.330
state of the United Nations,
is in a state of acute conflict

00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:40.682
and thousands are fleeing
South Sudan every day.

00:11:40.682 --> 00:11:42.820
A conflict we don't
hear much about.

00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:44.820
But as we think
about this crisis,

00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:47.970
we need to really have a
global picture in mind.

00:11:47.970 --> 00:11:51.260
And finally, I wanted
to say how important it

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:54.520
is that we have a
photographer amongst us,

00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:57.430
those of us who spend most
our time with written words.

00:11:57.430 --> 00:12:00.910
Because as we all know,
it was a photograph

00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:03.880
in this particular Syrian
context that really

00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:06.960
shifted the compass
so dramatically,

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:11.210
and really forced policy makers
to get outside their policy

00:12:11.210 --> 00:12:14.010
talk and think about the
humanitarian crisis, at least

00:12:14.010 --> 00:12:15.060
for a short period.

00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:19.330
So the role of photography
couldn't be more critical,

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:23.900
I think, to persuading
politicians to just

00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:26.600
take seriously the
humanitarian impact.

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:30.150
So let me briefly introduce
altogether our speakers

00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:34.380
in the order in which they're
going to be addressing us.

00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:39.060
First of all, I'm delighted to
welcome Dr. Noel Calhoun, who's

00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:43.370
a senior policy officer
who has been working

00:12:43.370 --> 00:12:45.550
with the Special
Advisor for the Summit

00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:48.360
on addressing large numbers
of refugees and migrants

00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:49.420
at the United Nations.

00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:51.840
That's quite a mouthful,
but basically, she

00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:55.930
was critically involved
in this big, first ever

00:12:55.930 --> 00:12:59.750
summit at the UN addressing
this large-scale migration

00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:01.020
on the 19th of September.

00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:04.600
So we're very lucky
to have her insights.

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:08.510
She now is going to be taking
up the position of Deputy

00:13:08.510 --> 00:13:12.130
Representative of
UNHCR in Ukraine,

00:13:12.130 --> 00:13:17.380
and she comes to us also as
a Harvard alum with an MA

00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:20.100
and a PhD from this university.

00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:24.410
Our second speaker is a close
friend and colleague, Dr. Susan

00:13:24.410 --> 00:13:28.740
Akram, who is Clinical Professor
of Law at Boston University Law

00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:31.360
School, and directs their
international human rights

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:32.190
clinic.

00:13:32.190 --> 00:13:35.920
She's a must-go-to person for
anyone working on refugees,

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:39.530
and has a long history of
doing extraordinary work,

00:13:39.530 --> 00:13:42.900
particularly on questions
relating to the Middle East,

00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:46.960
to Palestine, and to other
conflicts in the area.

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:50.420
She was recognized with a
Fulbright Senior Scholar

00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:54.450
Teaching and Research Award
some years ago for the research

00:13:54.450 --> 00:13:58.060
she's done, and she continues to
work not only on Middle Eastern

00:13:58.060 --> 00:14:01.650
issues, but also, for
example, on representing

00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:04.420
some of the people who've
been detained in Guantanamo.

00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:10.120
So she has both a very
impressive scholarly track

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:13.370
record, but also is
a practitioner who

00:14:13.370 --> 00:14:16.620
is at front line, so to speak.

00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:20.850
Thirdly, we have
Abdulkarim Ekzayez,

00:14:20.850 --> 00:14:24.780
who is a health program manager
from Save the Children's Syria

00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:25.330
response.

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:27.232
He's actually from--
I presume he's

00:14:27.232 --> 00:14:28.940
from Aleppo, because
he got his education

00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:31.150
at the University of Aleppo.

00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:35.140
And he is now based in
Turkey, but obviously makes

00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:38.910
frequent trips to
Syria, and is involved

00:14:38.910 --> 00:14:42.610
in a set of critical
campaigns, including campaigns

00:14:42.610 --> 00:14:45.710
to ensure that a higher
proportion than is

00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:49.160
the case right now of Syrian
children are immunized.

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:52.420
Some of you may be aware that
this drop in vaccination rates

00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:54.540
has been one of the
most concerning health

00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:56.360
correlates of the conflict.

00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:58.290
So thank you for joining us.

00:14:58.290 --> 00:15:00.270
And finally, last but
certainly not least,

00:15:00.270 --> 00:15:03.440
Rania Matar, our
independent photographer,

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:08.000
who was born and
raised in Lebanon,

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.670
and is an architect by
training, but is now

00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:15.440
a full-time
photographer, and also

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:18.720
a teacher at the Massachusetts
College of Art and Design.

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:24.330
She has a very long list
of credits to her name

00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:27.040
of exhibitions that her
work has been involved in,

00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:29.850
including, some of you may
have seen here at the MFA,

00:15:29.850 --> 00:15:33.100
the exhibition on
women from Iran,

00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:37.000
and other exhibitions
dealing with Arab women.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.430
She is currently part
of an exhibition called

00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:43.550
"Aftermath-- The Fallout of
War-- America in the Middle

00:15:43.550 --> 00:15:45.665
East", curated by
Carol McCusker.

00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:51.340
She's clearly been recognized
for much of the work

00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:54.610
she's done, including
receiving the 2011 Legacy

00:15:54.610 --> 00:15:58.110
Award at the Griffin
Museum of Photography

00:15:58.110 --> 00:16:00.970
for the photographic
work she's done.

00:16:00.970 --> 00:16:03.060
So thank you all so
much for joining us,

00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:05.490
and perhaps you can all
come up and sit next to me

00:16:05.490 --> 00:16:06.410
on the panel.

00:16:06.410 --> 00:16:08.905
[APPLAUSE]

00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:23.220
-Good afternoon.

00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:25.710
I wish to thank the
Radcliffe Institute

00:16:25.710 --> 00:16:30.880
for hosting an event on
the issue of refugees.

00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:34.270
I want to share with you
today from my experience

00:16:34.270 --> 00:16:37.960
of the process of
the preparations

00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:40.310
for the summit that
was held at the United

00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:42.920
Nations just a month ago.

00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:44.850
But before that,
to talk a little

00:16:44.850 --> 00:16:46.710
bit about the scope
of the problem.

00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:48.830
I think we've already
had the stage set for us,

00:16:48.830 --> 00:16:53.690
these numbers of 65
million displaced.

00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:55.600
That's a big number.

00:16:55.600 --> 00:17:00.040
As we heard, it's actually now
1% of the world's population.

00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:04.670
65 million is equivalent to
the population of the United

00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:06.869
Kingdom, for example.

00:17:06.869 --> 00:17:08.660
And often, you'll
hear the comparison

00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:12.869
that this is the largest
number of displaced persons

00:17:12.869 --> 00:17:15.180
since the Second World War.

00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:17.560
And I'd like to reflect
on that, because actually,

00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:21.550
the population now is three
times greater than what

00:17:21.550 --> 00:17:24.089
it was at the time of
the Second World War.

00:17:24.089 --> 00:17:27.660
And also, the economies of the
rich countries in the world

00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:29.690
have not been devastated.

00:17:29.690 --> 00:17:34.410
So really, this
should be a challenge

00:17:34.410 --> 00:17:36.640
that we can
collectively cope with,

00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:39.290
as well as our
forefathers and mothers

00:17:39.290 --> 00:17:42.470
did after the Second World War.

00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:46.480
Of these 65 million, 21
million are actually refugees,

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:49.770
meaning that they've crossed
an international border.

00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:52.240
The others are displaced
within their own country,

00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:54.200
including many Syrians
who are displaced

00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:55.770
within their own country.

00:17:55.770 --> 00:17:58.050
And five million Syrians,
or about a quarter

00:17:58.050 --> 00:18:03.560
of the world's refugees,
are displaced from Syria.

00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:05.920
So not only are
the numbers large,

00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:10.430
but the responsibility for
hosting the world's refugees

00:18:10.430 --> 00:18:11.970
is not shared fairly at all.

00:18:11.970 --> 00:18:14.990
When we read the press
or read the newspapers,

00:18:14.990 --> 00:18:16.680
we get the sense
that there are lots

00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:20.920
of refugees coming into
Europe and living in the US.

00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:24.920
But that impression is skewed,
because as we've heard,

00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:27.170
the vast majority of
the world's refugees

00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:29.200
are in developing countries.

00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:30.920
In fact, eight
countries in the world,

00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:33.390
all of them in
Africa or Asia, host

00:18:33.390 --> 00:18:36.550
half of the world's refugees.

00:18:36.550 --> 00:18:39.048
From their perspective,
this just isn't fair.

00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:44.290
Why do they end up
hosting these refugees?

00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:47.050
Well, it's really an
accident of geography.

00:18:47.050 --> 00:18:49.140
Because of their
proximity to countries

00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:51.150
that are engulfed
in conflict, they

00:18:51.150 --> 00:18:53.760
are the first
responders, and receiving

00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:56.570
large numbers of refugees.

00:18:56.570 --> 00:19:00.020
And they host them
for a very long time.

00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:03.070
Displacement is becoming
more and more protracted.

00:19:03.070 --> 00:19:06.840
Of the 21 million
refugees, how many

00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:09.160
were able to actually
go home last year?

00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:10.270
That's the real success.

00:19:10.270 --> 00:19:12.300
I'm a UNHCR staff
person, I've been

00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:14.700
working on refugee
issues for 15 years,

00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:16.360
and the big success
for us is when

00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:18.860
refugees can go home
and rebuild their lives.

00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:22.930
But last year, only
200,000 refugees

00:19:22.930 --> 00:19:24.925
were able to return
to their homes.

00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:30.340
And over this last
year, we've seen

00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:35.200
a lack of a coherent response
to these increased numbers.

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:38.180
States are reacting
to refugee flows

00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:41.780
with unilateral and highly
restrictive measures.

00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:45.150
They're looking for different
ways to deter entry,

00:19:45.150 --> 00:19:48.990
to restrict rights, to
detain asylum seekers,

00:19:48.990 --> 00:19:53.350
and to put up walls that are
both figurative and literal.

00:19:53.350 --> 00:19:56.490
We see that this causes
immense human suffering,

00:19:56.490 --> 00:19:58.490
that it violates human rights.

00:19:58.490 --> 00:20:04.170
And we also see that it's a
cause of dispute among states.

00:20:04.170 --> 00:20:08.640
And this calls out for an
international solution,

00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:12.970
for multilateral approaches
to solving problems.

00:20:12.970 --> 00:20:15.450
And this became even more
clear in the last year,

00:20:15.450 --> 00:20:19.240
in 2015, which was a
particularly horrible year

00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:23.290
for refugees, when we saw people
drowning in the Mediterranean.

00:20:23.290 --> 00:20:25.810
We saw boats adrift
in the Andaman Sea,

00:20:25.810 --> 00:20:29.930
looking for a safe harbor
where people could disembark.

00:20:29.930 --> 00:20:32.990
We saw dangerous land journeys,
not only in the Sahara,

00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:37.260
but closer to our home
here in Central America.

00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:42.090
And then, the rising problems of
protracted displacement, people

00:20:42.090 --> 00:20:45.610
being displaced for 5,
10, 20, even more, years.

00:20:45.610 --> 00:20:47.460
And then, the impact
that all of this

00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:51.520
was having on politics,
particularly in Europe, but now

00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:53.960
also in the United
States, where debates

00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:56.800
about resettlement of
Syrians have become

00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:58.110
a matter of national concern.

00:21:00.710 --> 00:21:02.790
Over the past year--
I mean now we're

00:21:02.790 --> 00:21:04.460
coming to the end
of the year, and it

00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:07.240
is a time when we can
start to look back at 2016,

00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:09.710
and reflect on what has
happened so far this year,

00:21:09.710 --> 00:21:12.570
and where things need to go--
there has been an attempt

00:21:12.570 --> 00:21:16.880
to revitalize a multilateral
response to refugee movement.

00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:19.030
So what has happened
over the past year,

00:21:19.030 --> 00:21:22.050
starting in February
of this year,

00:21:22.050 --> 00:21:24.750
there was a major
conference to raise funds

00:21:24.750 --> 00:21:27.360
for the countries that are
supporting Syrian refugees,

00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:31.840
and $12 billion was
pledged at that conference

00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:35.220
for Syrian refugees and the
countries that host them.

00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:38.460
The next month, the
UN refugee agencies

00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:42.130
gathered states to try to
persuade them to increase

00:21:42.130 --> 00:21:45.940
resettlement numbers, so
that more Syrian refugees

00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:49.240
could benefit from resettlement
to third countries.

00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:51.540
The actual results of
that were quite modest,

00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:54.540
but it takes time for countries
to start a program like that,

00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:55.990
a resettlement program.

00:21:55.990 --> 00:21:58.100
And now we're
starting to see, as we

00:21:58.100 --> 00:22:01.950
come to the end of the year,
that more states are pledging

00:22:01.950 --> 00:22:06.080
to start resettlement programs
or to increase their numbers.

00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:08.180
Something that many
countries, especially Turkey--

00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:11.190
I know Karim is
working in Turkey--

00:22:11.190 --> 00:22:14.890
are very interested
in seeing increases.

00:22:14.890 --> 00:22:19.130
We had the World Humanitarian
Summit in May of this year

00:22:19.130 --> 00:22:22.370
in Istanbul to try
to improve the way

00:22:22.370 --> 00:22:24.010
that humanitarian
and development

00:22:24.010 --> 00:22:27.360
workers address refugee crises.

00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:29.840
And then, on the
20th of September,

00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:32.690
so the day after the UN
Summit, President Obama

00:22:32.690 --> 00:22:37.770
hosted what was called the
Leaders Summit on Refugees,

00:22:37.770 --> 00:22:40.820
and this brought together
some 52 countries

00:22:40.820 --> 00:22:43.710
that were really ready to make
substantial pledges in terms

00:22:43.710 --> 00:22:46.940
of humanitarian funding,
resettlement places,

00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:52.050
and education and employment
opportunities for refugees.

00:22:52.050 --> 00:22:55.160
So really, there has been
a great deal of attention

00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:58.880
to try to improve a multilateral
response to the Syrian refugee

00:22:58.880 --> 00:22:59.460
crisis.

00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:04.500
But as Jackie has mentioned,
this is not only about Syria.

00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:08.960
And in fact, there can
be negative repercussions

00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:12.300
if we focus only on
one refugee crisis.

00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:15.220
As we were involved in the
intergovernmental negotiations

00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:19.260
leading up to the Summit
on the 19th of September,

00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:20.660
we also heard from
many countries

00:23:20.660 --> 00:23:23.630
that have been hosting
refugees for a very long time,

00:23:23.630 --> 00:23:28.020
and who feel that the
attention to Syrian refugees

00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:31.430
is somehow putting
them at a disadvantage.

00:23:31.430 --> 00:23:35.850
And that can lead to the
squeezing of the protection

00:23:35.850 --> 00:23:39.920
space for refugees
in those countries.

00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:44.700
So there is a recognition
that we can't only just keep

00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:48.450
having pledging conferences
and raising money, and maybe

00:23:48.450 --> 00:23:50.000
increasing our
resettlement numbers,

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.830
but we need to think
about longer-term issues

00:23:52.830 --> 00:23:55.370
and global trends.

00:23:55.370 --> 00:23:57.480
And on refugees,
the global trends

00:23:57.480 --> 00:24:02.010
are these permanent shortfalls
in humanitarian funding,

00:24:02.010 --> 00:24:06.510
the length of displacement,
and the disproportionate strain

00:24:06.510 --> 00:24:08.190
on a few countries.

00:24:08.190 --> 00:24:10.730
And then there's also
migration more generally.

00:24:10.730 --> 00:24:14.280
International migration
is a growing global trend,

00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:17.000
but the governance structure
for international migration

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.770
is really in its infancy.

00:24:19.770 --> 00:24:22.050
We have better systems
internationally

00:24:22.050 --> 00:24:25.400
for governing the movements
of goods and services

00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:29.520
than we do for governing
the movement of people.

00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:32.900
And yet, international
migration has traditionally

00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:35.650
been an issue that
member states do not

00:24:35.650 --> 00:24:37.300
want to discuss in
the United Nations,

00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:40.780
because it is considered a
closely guarded attribute

00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:43.790
of national sovereignty, and
not something to be discussed

00:24:43.790 --> 00:24:45.900
in a multilateral forum.

00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:48.490
So the goals of
the Summit that we

00:24:48.490 --> 00:24:53.930
held on the 19th of September
at the General Assembly

00:24:53.930 --> 00:24:56.400
was really to
agree on some tools

00:24:56.400 --> 00:25:00.000
for sharing responsibility
for the world's refugees,

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.530
and to bring the
issue of migration

00:25:02.530 --> 00:25:05.810
into a multilateral
forum, and to start work

00:25:05.810 --> 00:25:10.510
toward a governance structure
for international migration.

00:25:10.510 --> 00:25:14.420
Now, this Summit occurs in
an intergovernmental context,

00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:16.110
and it occurs in the
General Assembly.

00:25:16.110 --> 00:25:18.320
And that institutional
context is

00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:20.640
important to understand
what actually

00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:22.640
happened at the Summit.

00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:25.860
The General Assembly is unique
as an international body,

00:25:25.860 --> 00:25:28.130
in that it brings
together all 193 member

00:25:28.130 --> 00:25:32.580
states with a one-state,
one-vote principle.

00:25:32.580 --> 00:25:34.850
And decisions in
the General Assembly

00:25:34.850 --> 00:25:37.240
are taken by consensus.

00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:39.714
That means we try to
get everybody to agree.

00:25:39.714 --> 00:25:41.130
In the last week,
I've been trying

00:25:41.130 --> 00:25:44.690
to get 20 of my colleagues
to agree on a document

00:25:44.690 --> 00:25:46.530
and I've been struggling.

00:25:46.530 --> 00:25:48.770
When you try to do that
in the General Assembly,

00:25:48.770 --> 00:25:53.320
with 193 members states
with very diverse interests,

00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:55.430
it's quite a challenge.

00:25:55.430 --> 00:25:57.420
However, the member
states agreed early on

00:25:57.420 --> 00:25:58.970
in the negotiations
that they didn't

00:25:58.970 --> 00:26:03.300
want to just have the president
of the General Assembly

00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:05.780
write a summary of their
summit and be done with it.

00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:09.300
They actually wanted
to negotiate a text.

00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:12.150
And so we spent
the summer working

00:26:12.150 --> 00:26:14.830
under the leadership of
the ambassadors of Jordan

00:26:14.830 --> 00:26:15.390
and Ireland.

00:26:15.390 --> 00:26:18.250
We spent the summer
trying to negotiate

00:26:18.250 --> 00:26:20.630
this text among states.

00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:23.910
And they really bring very
different perspectives,

00:26:23.910 --> 00:26:29.770
from the states that hosts a
lot of refugees-- I'm trying

00:26:29.770 --> 00:26:30.937
to see how this clock works.

00:26:30.937 --> 00:26:32.186
-You've only got five seconds.

00:26:32.186 --> 00:26:32.990
-Five seconds.

00:26:32.990 --> 00:26:33.724
Oh, dear.

00:26:33.724 --> 00:26:37.850
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:37.850 --> 00:26:41.960
What we ended up with out of
this very difficult negotiation

00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:47.070
was a document that
underlines certain commitments

00:26:47.070 --> 00:26:52.680
to the human rights of
all refugees and migrants,

00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:57.470
reaffirms the 1951
Convention for Refugees.

00:26:57.470 --> 00:27:02.070
It sets up a-- it agrees on a
comprehensive refugee response

00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:05.440
plan, and sets forth the
elements for that plan,

00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:08.640
so that we focus not only on
short-term humanitarian needs,

00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:12.590
but longer-term development
needs of countries

00:27:12.590 --> 00:27:14.680
that are hosting refugees.

00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:17.830
And we have a two-year
process to agree

00:27:17.830 --> 00:27:22.120
on what we're calling a Global
Compact on Refugees that

00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:26.330
will establish a fairer system
for sharing responsibility

00:27:26.330 --> 00:27:27.430
among countries.

00:27:27.430 --> 00:27:30.660
We also have a similar process,
an intergovernmental process,

00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:32.860
on migration that
we hope will lead

00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:36.380
to a global compact
for safe, orderly,

00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:40.600
and regular migration by 2018,
and so negotiations on that

00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:44.090
are getting started in New York.

00:27:44.090 --> 00:27:48.420
But I would just end by saying
that that political declaration

00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:52.700
adopted in New York, it
does have a legitimacy,

00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:55.990
it represents a commitment,
but it's not legally binding.

00:27:55.990 --> 00:27:59.610
What it takes to make
the states accountable

00:27:59.610 --> 00:28:02.460
is action on lots
of different levels.

00:28:02.460 --> 00:28:04.040
And I know from
working in the field

00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:07.050
that the most important
action is really

00:28:07.050 --> 00:28:09.750
from the civil
society organizations,

00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:13.300
and from ordinary citizens
who raise these issues, who

00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:19.830
make the situation of refugees
very real, and press for states

00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:24.690
to live up to the commitments
that they made in New York

00:28:24.690 --> 00:28:25.790
on the 19th of September.

00:28:25.790 --> 00:28:26.868
So thank you.

00:28:26.868 --> 00:28:29.358
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:40.990
-Thank you all for coming.

00:28:40.990 --> 00:28:43.310
It's quite amazing to
have this number of people

00:28:43.310 --> 00:28:46.070
interested in refugees.

00:28:46.070 --> 00:28:49.210
Those of us who feel like we're
always talking to ourselves

00:28:49.210 --> 00:28:55.120
can be sometimes gratified
by talking to others.

00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:56.800
So I'm going to
move the discussion

00:28:56.800 --> 00:29:01.490
from the more political
orientation to a framework

00:29:01.490 --> 00:29:04.960
of looking at the Syrian crisis
from the point of view of what

00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:08.330
the law has to say about it.

00:29:08.330 --> 00:29:12.790
And as you've heard already of
the global refugee total, that

00:29:12.790 --> 00:29:16.550
is convention refugees,
documented now by the United

00:29:16.550 --> 00:29:18.370
Nations High Commissioner
for Refugees,

00:29:18.370 --> 00:29:23.990
is 21 million people in 2016.

00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:29.330
Syria represents 22% of
that refugee population.

00:29:29.330 --> 00:29:32.740
It's the largest source
country for refugees

00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:35.780
in the world today.

00:29:35.780 --> 00:29:39.230
And as of September
30th, UNHCR figures

00:29:39.230 --> 00:29:44.970
show 4.8 million total
persons from Syria registered

00:29:44.970 --> 00:29:49.400
in the region, 2
million in Turkey alone,

00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:55.060
and the balance of those in
Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq, Egypt,

00:29:55.060 --> 00:29:57.240
and the rest of North Africa.

00:29:57.240 --> 00:30:01.610
Now, these figures have to be
understood in context as well.

00:30:01.610 --> 00:30:04.100
Lebanon and Jordan,
along with Syria,

00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:06.760
already hosted the
majority of the world's

00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:10.220
Palestinian refugees
for over 60 years.

00:30:10.220 --> 00:30:13.770
More than 2 million registered
in Jordan, half a million

00:30:13.770 --> 00:30:16.520
in Lebanon, over half
a million in Syria

00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:19.970
before the crisis in 2011.

00:30:19.970 --> 00:30:25.290
Now one person in four
in Lebanon is a refugee.

00:30:25.290 --> 00:30:27.390
While in Jordan, one
of the most water

00:30:27.390 --> 00:30:30.940
stressed countries in the world,
with insufficient capacity

00:30:30.940 --> 00:30:35.850
to provide water and other basic
resources to its own people,

00:30:35.850 --> 00:30:39.880
one quarter of the
population is refugees.

00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:41.810
And that bears some
thinking about when

00:30:41.810 --> 00:30:45.570
we are talking about the numbers
that the United States is

00:30:45.570 --> 00:30:48.896
looking at on its
southern border.

00:30:48.896 --> 00:30:52.490
Despite incredible efforts to
provide for the Syrian refugee

00:30:52.490 --> 00:30:57.310
influx, Jordan and Lebanon have
long since exceeded capacity

00:30:57.310 --> 00:31:01.800
to absorb more refugees, and
both countries quite recently

00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:04.470
closed their borders with Syria.

00:31:04.470 --> 00:31:07.250
What's particularly interesting
from a legal point of view

00:31:07.250 --> 00:31:11.330
is that the main host countries
to the Syrians fleeing the war

00:31:11.330 --> 00:31:15.430
had no applicable refugee and
asylum frameworks in place

00:31:15.430 --> 00:31:17.260
before 2011.

00:31:17.260 --> 00:31:19.590
Lebanon and Jordan
are not parties

00:31:19.590 --> 00:31:22.070
to the main international
treaty governing

00:31:22.070 --> 00:31:25.260
the rights and status of
refugees, the 1951 Refugee

00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:26.720
Convention.

00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:30.520
And although Egypt and Turkey
are parties to the convention,

00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:32.990
they have carved out
significant exceptions

00:31:32.990 --> 00:31:37.220
to its application that have
affected the status of Syrians

00:31:37.220 --> 00:31:39.460
as refugees.

00:31:39.460 --> 00:31:43.220
As a result, all of these
states treated Syrians

00:31:43.220 --> 00:31:46.860
as irregular migrants,
short-term visitors,

00:31:46.860 --> 00:31:49.050
or in other statuses
with policies

00:31:49.050 --> 00:31:51.610
that have fluctuated over time.

00:31:51.610 --> 00:31:54.150
For the first four
years of the crisis,

00:31:54.150 --> 00:31:57.640
these governments did not
conceive of incoming Syrians

00:31:57.640 --> 00:32:00.110
as refugees, per se.

00:32:00.110 --> 00:32:04.210
As guests, migrants, displaced
civilians, or more recently,

00:32:04.210 --> 00:32:07.400
as a result of a major
change in the law in Turkey,

00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:10.630
persons under temporary
protection status.

00:32:10.630 --> 00:32:13.880
As such, even without
formal refugee policies,

00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:17.650
all the frontline states,
until the end of last year,

00:32:17.650 --> 00:32:21.070
were extremely generous in
opening their territories

00:32:21.070 --> 00:32:25.330
to the refugees, establishing
almost open-door policies,

00:32:25.330 --> 00:32:29.240
together hosting the almost
4 million refugees as best

00:32:29.240 --> 00:32:30.630
they could.

00:32:30.630 --> 00:32:32.550
So what changed?

00:32:32.550 --> 00:32:34.560
These basically
open-door policies

00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:37.850
towards refugees from
the states in the region

00:32:37.850 --> 00:32:42.480
have become a closed-door policy
towards new Syrian entrance

00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:45.290
over the last approximately
year and a half.

00:32:45.290 --> 00:32:47.400
And the key factor
in this change

00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:50.500
are the policies imposed
by Western states

00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:55.470
to stem the flood of refugees
from moving beyond the region.

00:32:55.470 --> 00:32:58.520
As Noel discussed,
billions of dollars

00:32:58.520 --> 00:33:01.980
have been raised and spent
already on this crisis.

00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:04.610
As of last September,
Turkey's government

00:33:04.610 --> 00:33:09.680
claimed it had spent
already 5.37 billion euros

00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:14.480
of its own money, well exceeding
the entire donation of the EU

00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:16.450
by then to the crisis.

00:33:16.450 --> 00:33:19.500
But all of the financial
plans, and a host

00:33:19.500 --> 00:33:23.100
of European and Western
policies concerning refugees,

00:33:23.100 --> 00:33:26.350
focus on a paradigm
of containment,

00:33:26.350 --> 00:33:30.980
ensuring the refugee crisis
remains in the region.

00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:33.790
Restrictive policies in
Europe and the Americas,

00:33:33.790 --> 00:33:35.910
including the EU
Schengen and Dublin

00:33:35.910 --> 00:33:39.560
rules, that penalize
illegal border crossers

00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:41.930
and prevent access
to refugee status,

00:33:41.930 --> 00:33:45.330
have created extremely
dangerous barriers

00:33:45.330 --> 00:33:47.500
to Syrian asylum seekers.

00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:51.470
As a result of these barriers,
more than 7,500 people

00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:55.480
have died trying to make
the risky sea crossing

00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:57.820
to Europe since 2014.

00:33:57.820 --> 00:34:00.560
Two children drown
on average every day

00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:05.120
in the Mediterranean or
Aegean trying to reach Europe.

00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:08.929
The extremely generous policies
that Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan,

00:34:08.929 --> 00:34:12.610
and even Egypt had put in place
at the start of the crisis

00:34:12.610 --> 00:34:16.060
began rapidly reversing
as a direct result

00:34:16.060 --> 00:34:18.530
of the failure of states
outside the region

00:34:18.530 --> 00:34:23.520
to share responsibility for a
portion of the refugee flow.

00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:26.370
While these countries are
hosting over 4 million

00:34:26.370 --> 00:34:28.679
of the 5 million
Syrian refugees,

00:34:28.679 --> 00:34:31.300
the EU has asked
the European states

00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:37.150
to pledge no more than 160,000
resettlement slots for refugees

00:34:37.150 --> 00:34:40.120
from Syria, Iraq, and Eritrea.

00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:44.989
And so far, no more than
270,000 asylum applications

00:34:44.989 --> 00:34:49.460
have been submitted by
Syrians all across Europe.

00:34:49.460 --> 00:34:53.230
And resettled refugees and
asylum seekers in the EU

00:34:53.230 --> 00:34:58.750
represent far less than 10% of
the Syrian refugee population.

00:34:58.750 --> 00:35:01.000
The US administration's
recent announcement

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.820
that it would accept
an additional 10,000

00:35:03.820 --> 00:35:07.180
Syrian refugees this
year, though welcome,

00:35:07.180 --> 00:35:09.900
is also an extremely
small expansion

00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:14.080
to the US's 70,000 yearly
global refugee ceiling,

00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:17.920
and contributes little
to relieving the crisis.

00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:21.330
The latest EU-Turkey agreement
to send refugees back

00:35:21.330 --> 00:35:24.210
who survived the risky
journey by sea or land

00:35:24.210 --> 00:35:26.970
from Turkey to Europe
with a 3 billion

00:35:26.970 --> 00:35:29.950
euro financial incentive
and a, quote unquote,

00:35:29.950 --> 00:35:33.310
"refugee exchange plan",
is only the latest

00:35:33.310 --> 00:35:36.090
of the Western policies
of containment.

00:35:36.090 --> 00:35:40.270
The EU-Turkey agreement, the
combined Dublin-Schengen rules,

00:35:40.270 --> 00:35:43.620
and push-back policies in
the Eastern European states

00:35:43.620 --> 00:35:46.850
are major elements of the
containment paradigm currently

00:35:46.850 --> 00:35:49.810
driving the Middle
East refugee dynamic.

00:35:49.810 --> 00:35:53.460
Meanwhile, major barriers
in US refugee law,

00:35:53.460 --> 00:35:56.180
such as the over-expansive
material support

00:35:56.180 --> 00:35:59.110
for terrorism bars
that prevent thousands

00:35:59.110 --> 00:36:02.730
of legitimate refugees from
being admitted to this country,

00:36:02.730 --> 00:36:04.990
mean that hundreds
of eligible Syrians

00:36:04.990 --> 00:36:09.560
are waiting in limbo after being
granted refugee recognition

00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:12.690
in the host states, while
the multi-agency vetting

00:36:12.690 --> 00:36:17.470
process in the US wends
its way to conclusion.

00:36:17.470 --> 00:36:19.580
The main thrust, then,
of these policies

00:36:19.580 --> 00:36:22.220
is not protection of
the vulnerable migrants

00:36:22.220 --> 00:36:24.990
and refugees who are
the subjects of it,

00:36:24.990 --> 00:36:27.990
but a solidifying of
this containment paradigm

00:36:27.990 --> 00:36:33.410
on which the US and the EU
have operated since the migrant

00:36:33.410 --> 00:36:35.150
and refugee crisis
in the Middle East

00:36:35.150 --> 00:36:37.910
made its way to
Europe and beyond.

00:36:37.910 --> 00:36:40.830
In brief, the
policy's major focus

00:36:40.830 --> 00:36:43.510
is to make sure the refugees
and migrants currently

00:36:43.510 --> 00:36:46.350
hosted in the millions
by the neighboring states

00:36:46.350 --> 00:36:48.880
remain there, and are
barred by whatever

00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:52.180
means necessary from
leaving the region.

00:36:52.180 --> 00:36:54.960
This is exactly the
opposite of the thrust

00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:56.760
of the purpose of
the treaties that

00:36:56.760 --> 00:37:00.910
bind the EU and the wider
community of European and most

00:37:00.910 --> 00:37:02.540
Western states.

00:37:02.540 --> 00:37:04.900
The primary and, of
course, most important

00:37:04.900 --> 00:37:08.040
international legal
obligations towards refugees

00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:11.080
arise from the 1951
Refugee Convention

00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:14.900
and its companion
1967 Protocol, as one

00:37:14.900 --> 00:37:17.390
or both of these
instruments bind

00:37:17.390 --> 00:37:21.830
all the states in Europe,
the US, as well as Turkey.

00:37:21.830 --> 00:37:24.270
The essential elements
of the Refugee Convention

00:37:24.270 --> 00:37:27.900
are the obligation not to
return a refugee to a place

00:37:27.900 --> 00:37:31.630
where she risks persecution,
non-refoulement,

00:37:31.630 --> 00:37:34.050
the obligation of
each state party

00:37:34.050 --> 00:37:37.710
to provide fair access
to asylum procedures

00:37:37.710 --> 00:37:41.320
to refugees on a
nondiscriminatory basis,

00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:44.810
and the prohibition against
collective expulsion.

00:37:44.810 --> 00:37:47.000
These elements
are expanded under

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:49.740
European regional
instruments, such as the EU

00:37:49.740 --> 00:37:52.660
Charter, the Civil and
Political Rights Treaty,

00:37:52.660 --> 00:37:54.820
the European Convention
on Human Rights,

00:37:54.820 --> 00:37:58.620
and decisions of the two
European courts, the Strasbourg

00:37:58.620 --> 00:38:01.250
and the Luxembourg courts.

00:38:01.250 --> 00:38:03.620
These courts have
further articulated

00:38:03.620 --> 00:38:07.610
that collective expulsion
includes when a state removes

00:38:07.610 --> 00:38:11.360
refugees and migrants from its
territory in any manner that

00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:15.400
fails to provide them with
access to fair procedures

00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:17.580
for international protection.

00:38:17.580 --> 00:38:20.010
The prohibition against
collective expulsion

00:38:20.010 --> 00:38:23.130
also includes removing
persons on the basis

00:38:23.130 --> 00:38:25.930
of their national
or ethnic identity,

00:38:25.930 --> 00:38:30.340
through pro forma proceedings,
or without access to counsel,

00:38:30.340 --> 00:38:34.660
or where not appeal is available
from a removal decision.

00:38:34.660 --> 00:38:38.640
Focusing further on Europe,
under EU laws and regulations,

00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:41.720
there are additional
obligations on member states.

00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:44.130
In situations of
emergency, where

00:38:44.130 --> 00:38:47.320
there is mass influx
of displaced persons,

00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:51.500
EU states must provide temporary
protection against return,

00:38:51.500 --> 00:38:53.800
regardless of internal
EU arrangements

00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:58.680
such as Dublin and
Schengen. European states

00:38:58.680 --> 00:39:00.670
parties to the
European Convention

00:39:00.670 --> 00:39:03.830
are prohibited from sending
refugees to other states

00:39:03.830 --> 00:39:06.300
where the individuals
would be at risk of return

00:39:06.300 --> 00:39:10.680
to persecution or violations
of their convention rights.

00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:13.660
It is well accepted that
international responsibility

00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:16.900
and burden sharing
of refugees is today

00:39:16.900 --> 00:39:19.960
a legal obligation
on all states parties

00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:21.870
to the Refugee Convention.

00:39:21.870 --> 00:39:25.580
In spite of all this, the
way forward is well-known.

00:39:25.580 --> 00:39:27.680
Under prior
international practice,

00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:30.920
all states parties to the
Refugee Convention regime,

00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:34.220
not just European states,
should be participating

00:39:34.220 --> 00:39:38.640
in a UNHCR-led proposal for a
comprehensive plan of action

00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:41.030
that sets out
numbers of refugees

00:39:41.030 --> 00:39:43.330
that each state
agrees to accept,

00:39:43.330 --> 00:39:46.910
the various kinds of status
that participating states are

00:39:46.910 --> 00:39:50.090
willing to provide, minimum
standards of benefits

00:39:50.090 --> 00:39:53.550
to be granted the refugees,
and fair refugee status

00:39:53.550 --> 00:39:56.780
determinations in all states.

00:39:56.780 --> 00:40:00.450
Such CPAs have been negotiated
in mass refugee flows

00:40:00.450 --> 00:40:03.760
all over the world
from the 1970s onwards,

00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:06.350
and well established
guidelines and criteria

00:40:06.350 --> 00:40:11.640
exist as solid precedent to
resolve this current crisis.

00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:14.280
These are legal
obligations, and are the key

00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:17.670
to providing a real and durable
solution to the millions

00:40:17.670 --> 00:40:20.480
of individual human
beings forced from home

00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:23.950
and victimized by a crisis
not of their making.

00:40:23.950 --> 00:40:26.222
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:38.780
-Thank you all for
showing interest.

00:40:38.780 --> 00:40:40.720
And thank you for
Radcliffe Institute

00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:44.300
for giving this
platform to try to build

00:40:44.300 --> 00:40:49.070
a common understanding of the
cause of this refugee crisis.

00:40:49.070 --> 00:40:52.330
Whenever I'm invited
to talk about Syria,

00:40:52.330 --> 00:40:55.200
I set to prepare
some talking points,

00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:58.570
but within minutes the
nostalgia takes me there,

00:40:58.570 --> 00:41:02.750
where I miss my room, I
miss my library, my diary,

00:41:02.750 --> 00:41:04.960
which should be sitting
somewhere under that rubble

00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:07.050
now.

00:41:07.050 --> 00:41:11.460
Each single family in Syria
has lost either a family member

00:41:11.460 --> 00:41:13.530
or a house or belongings.

00:41:13.530 --> 00:41:19.000
Syria has lost-- 700,000 people
were killed out of 23 million

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:22.470
of their population, which means
each single family, especially

00:41:22.470 --> 00:41:24.360
in the
opposition-controlled areas,

00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:27.570
they lost a family member.

00:41:27.570 --> 00:41:29.530
However, as I have
just 10 minutes,

00:41:29.530 --> 00:41:32.700
I will try to go
as fast as I can.

00:41:32.700 --> 00:41:38.310
And bear with me if
I wasn't very fast.

00:41:38.310 --> 00:41:41.680
So why now are we talking
about this refugee crisis?

00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:44.270
Why now, starting from 2015?

00:41:44.270 --> 00:41:47.480
The answer is obvious,
because some refugees

00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:49.680
arrived to Europe.

00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:53.480
These refugees started
in 2012 and 2013.

00:41:53.480 --> 00:41:56.800
Syrians were daily
fleeing out of country,

00:41:56.800 --> 00:42:00.340
and we heard the numbers
from Susan and Noel

00:42:00.340 --> 00:42:02.520
about the numbers in the region.

00:42:05.961 --> 00:42:08.210
But the problem is that some
countries or some people,

00:42:08.210 --> 00:42:10.440
maybe, they don't feel
the suffering or the pain

00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:14.230
until the risk
knocks at their door.

00:42:14.230 --> 00:42:15.540
It is a long trip.

00:42:15.540 --> 00:42:17.220
It is a long, risky trip.

00:42:17.220 --> 00:42:23.510
So Syrians, they go from Syria
through the Turkish border.

00:42:23.510 --> 00:42:25.510
Which could be
risky, because Turkey

00:42:25.510 --> 00:42:29.160
has closed their
border since 2015,

00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:33.260
and most families and persons,
they are crossing illegally.

00:42:33.260 --> 00:42:36.880
Just in July, a few months
ago, a family was crossing.

00:42:36.880 --> 00:42:41.470
Of 15 family members, 11 of them
were killed by the Turkish army

00:42:41.470 --> 00:42:45.390
while they were trying to
cross illegally to Turkey.

00:42:45.390 --> 00:42:47.930
And then, from Turkey
to Greece, crossing

00:42:47.930 --> 00:42:50.890
the sea, which is
the most risky part.

00:42:50.890 --> 00:42:53.220
And then, there are
a lot of barriers

00:42:53.220 --> 00:42:57.480
here until they arrived to
their final destinations.

00:42:57.480 --> 00:43:02.490
And we saw a lot of photos of
families drowning in the sea.

00:43:02.490 --> 00:43:08.470
2,500 people drowned in the
Mediterranean in this crisis.

00:43:08.470 --> 00:43:10.860
And we should ask
ourselves why it

00:43:10.860 --> 00:43:14.090
seems that the conditions
they are escaping from

00:43:14.090 --> 00:43:18.040
are worse than
drowning in the sea.

00:43:18.040 --> 00:43:21.480
And it's not just the
only displacement.

00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:23.950
There are other displacements.

00:43:23.950 --> 00:43:25.880
Could be even more in numbers.

00:43:25.880 --> 00:43:27.470
The internal
displacement, people

00:43:27.470 --> 00:43:31.460
in Syria on a daily
basis, on a weekly basis,

00:43:31.460 --> 00:43:33.770
we have massive population
movements escaping

00:43:33.770 --> 00:43:35.950
from violence within Syria.

00:43:35.950 --> 00:43:40.160
We have a lot of ad hoc camps
next to the Turkish border,

00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:42.310
and everywhere in Syria,
containing at least

00:43:42.310 --> 00:43:44.290
300,000 people or more.

00:43:44.290 --> 00:43:48.010
These camps are
completely not organized,

00:43:48.010 --> 00:43:50.510
because there is no
official presence

00:43:50.510 --> 00:43:53.010
of the UNHCR or
international organizations

00:43:53.010 --> 00:43:54.650
to organize these camps.

00:43:54.650 --> 00:43:56.760
So it has the
minimum-- does not even

00:43:56.760 --> 00:44:00.500
have the minimum level
of shelter conditions.

00:44:00.500 --> 00:44:02.900
Most of these families
are women and children.

00:44:02.900 --> 00:44:05.720
Some families, they had
to move several times

00:44:05.720 --> 00:44:08.310
until they arrived to
their final destination.

00:44:08.310 --> 00:44:12.300
This family we met in Idlib,
they moved four times,

00:44:12.300 --> 00:44:15.320
from Damascus to rural Damascus,
and then to Homs, and then

00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:18.405
to northern Hama, until
they arrived to this school

00:44:18.405 --> 00:44:20.970
in Idlib, where they are
sharing the classroom

00:44:20.970 --> 00:44:22.540
with other families.

00:44:22.540 --> 00:44:25.970
But look at her
having some hope,

00:44:25.970 --> 00:44:30.160
looking into her child's eyes.

00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:32.110
The question is, why?

00:44:32.110 --> 00:44:35.250
And the reason is obvious,
because of the Syrian crisis.

00:44:35.250 --> 00:44:39.000
But could we define
what's happening in Syria?

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:43.320
It is a civil war or
a public revolution?

00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:44.620
We have a lot of answers.

00:44:44.620 --> 00:44:47.370
We don't have at the moment
a common understanding

00:44:47.370 --> 00:44:50.090
of what's happening in Syria.

00:44:50.090 --> 00:44:53.300
And maybe because of
the media, maybe because

00:44:53.300 --> 00:44:57.120
of the political complications.

00:44:57.120 --> 00:44:59.590
I will try as best
as I can to build

00:44:59.590 --> 00:45:06.530
a common understanding quickly,
an intro one, as much as I can.

00:45:06.530 --> 00:45:08.890
This map is for Syria currently.

00:45:08.890 --> 00:45:13.960
Each color refers to a different
party, and within each color

00:45:13.960 --> 00:45:18.170
there are different sub-parties
or different groups.

00:45:18.170 --> 00:45:22.800
The red one is the regime where
they control the main cities.

00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:25.880
The green one is the
opposition's, and there

00:45:25.880 --> 00:45:28.910
are hundreds of fractions.

00:45:28.910 --> 00:45:33.390
The black one is ISIL and
the yellow one is the Kurds.

00:45:33.390 --> 00:45:36.090
And here, the blue one
here, is the Turks,

00:45:36.090 --> 00:45:40.640
because even the Turks
now are in Syria.

00:45:40.640 --> 00:45:43.890
To understand maybe
the crisis is quickly,

00:45:43.890 --> 00:45:46.480
to review the timeline
of this crisis,

00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:50.480
the spark started
in March 2011, when

00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:53.550
some children from Talkalakh,
they wrote some statements

00:45:53.550 --> 00:45:57.290
against the regime on the wall,
and the children were punished

00:45:57.290 --> 00:45:59.760
by the intelligence agencies.

00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:03.230
People went into
demonstrations against this,

00:46:03.230 --> 00:46:05.810
and these demonstrations
spread out of the country.

00:46:05.810 --> 00:46:07.610
This photo is from Hama.

00:46:07.610 --> 00:46:11.620
But the response from
the intelligence agencies

00:46:11.620 --> 00:46:15.620
against these protesters
was really violent,

00:46:15.620 --> 00:46:18.320
so that's why some
commanders and soldiers

00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:19.910
from the Syrian
Army, they refused

00:46:19.910 --> 00:46:21.460
to participate in
these practices

00:46:21.460 --> 00:46:23.930
against the protesters.

00:46:23.930 --> 00:46:26.420
So they established
in 2011 something

00:46:26.420 --> 00:46:29.430
called the Free Syrian Army.

00:46:29.430 --> 00:46:32.950
In 2013, the Free Syrian
Army expanded and controlled

00:46:32.950 --> 00:46:35.650
a lot of rural areas.

00:46:35.650 --> 00:46:40.070
But the regime, they are still
controlling the main capitals.

00:46:40.070 --> 00:46:43.400
And the Kurds, they have
some process in their areas.

00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:48.130
In 2014, the situation
came to be complicated,

00:46:48.130 --> 00:46:50.630
because there were a
lot of parties involved

00:46:50.630 --> 00:46:53.090
from the regime side,
mainly Hezbollah

00:46:53.090 --> 00:46:59.630
from Lebanon, some Shia
militias from Iraq and Iran.

00:46:59.630 --> 00:47:02.760
And again, the Turkish
border from the other side,

00:47:02.760 --> 00:47:05.680
the opposition's, brought
a lot of jihadists

00:47:05.680 --> 00:47:10.440
to fight, because the war
starting from this point

00:47:10.440 --> 00:47:13.540
maybe had some
sectorial perspectives,

00:47:13.540 --> 00:47:19.670
because some of the parties
participated in this conflict.

00:47:19.670 --> 00:47:24.110
And here we have in 2014
the first presence of ISIL,

00:47:24.110 --> 00:47:25.930
but in limited areas.

00:47:25.930 --> 00:47:30.200
In 2015, ISIL has
expanded a lot.

00:47:30.200 --> 00:47:33.200
50% of Syria was
controlled by ISIL.

00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:36.670
The regime shrank
to the main cities,

00:47:36.670 --> 00:47:39.530
and the opposition's,
maybe they selected

00:47:39.530 --> 00:47:43.380
or they were given
Idlib as the main hub.

00:47:43.380 --> 00:47:48.100
And the Kurds, they
are in the same areas.

00:47:48.100 --> 00:47:53.790
In 2016, here you go, we
have more external parties.

00:47:53.790 --> 00:47:58.390
We have Russia, they have boots
on the ground with the regime,

00:47:58.390 --> 00:48:01.340
Iran sent boots on the
ground, in addition to

00:48:01.340 --> 00:48:04.170
Hezbollah and Iraqi militias.

00:48:04.170 --> 00:48:07.510
And from the other
side, the US with

00:48:07.510 --> 00:48:12.220
an international collation,
they hit areas in ISIS.

00:48:12.220 --> 00:48:14.140
The US, they support
the Kurds, and they

00:48:14.140 --> 00:48:15.980
are fighting against ISIS.

00:48:15.980 --> 00:48:19.380
So that's why Kurds, they
expanded a little bit.

00:48:19.380 --> 00:48:24.970
But because of the tension
between Turkey and the Kurds,

00:48:24.970 --> 00:48:27.870
the Turks expanded to
have some lands here.

00:48:27.870 --> 00:48:29.990
And there are many
other parties.

00:48:29.990 --> 00:48:31.970
Maybe they don't have
boots on the ground,

00:48:31.970 --> 00:48:33.960
but they are still
involved in this crisis.

00:48:33.960 --> 00:48:39.320
So it is not a
Syrian-to-Syrian conflict.

00:48:39.320 --> 00:48:42.320
Just recently,
Aleppo City, which

00:48:42.320 --> 00:48:45.890
is the second-largest
city in Syria,

00:48:45.890 --> 00:48:48.110
was completely
besieged by the regime,

00:48:48.110 --> 00:48:51.230
putting approximately
300,000 people

00:48:51.230 --> 00:48:53.310
under besiegement in this area.

00:48:53.310 --> 00:48:56.380
They don't have any access
to any life services.

00:48:56.380 --> 00:49:00.870
Just quickly, I will say quick
statements, and if it's true,

00:49:00.870 --> 00:49:02.670
raise your hand, please, OK?

00:49:02.670 --> 00:49:04.640
About the besieged areas.

00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:07.000
The regime allows injured
people and medical cases

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:09.970
to get out of the besieged
area seeking medical help.

00:49:09.970 --> 00:49:11.580
Is it true?

00:49:11.580 --> 00:49:12.790
No, it is not true.

00:49:12.790 --> 00:49:16.130
A lot of people, they die
in the besieged areas,

00:49:16.130 --> 00:49:18.490
because they cannot
seek medical help.

00:49:18.490 --> 00:49:24.050
Food, water, fuel are not
allowed to get in at any point.

00:49:24.050 --> 00:49:26.550
It is true.

00:49:26.550 --> 00:49:29.183
Medical supplies are excluded
from the restrictions.

00:49:32.290 --> 00:49:35.090
No, it is not excluded,
even medical supplies.

00:49:35.090 --> 00:49:37.245
The hospitals now, they
are suffering, especially

00:49:37.245 --> 00:49:40.570
in Aleppo, from having
no medical supplies.

00:49:40.570 --> 00:49:42.820
Aid workers and UN
agencies are allowed

00:49:42.820 --> 00:49:44.360
to enter besieged
areas, but they

00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:46.747
don't want to enter,
ensuring their staff safety.

00:49:49.562 --> 00:49:51.020
Seems you have a
good understanding

00:49:51.020 --> 00:49:53.570
about the besieged areas.

00:49:53.570 --> 00:49:54.960
It is not true.

00:49:54.960 --> 00:50:00.530
They are not allowed to
enter the besieged areas.

00:50:00.530 --> 00:50:01.980
It's not just the besiegement.

00:50:01.980 --> 00:50:05.230
There are daily targetings
of civilian infrastructure.

00:50:05.230 --> 00:50:07.540
Just in July and
August, the health class

00:50:07.540 --> 00:50:10.870
reported more than
30 hospitals being

00:50:10.870 --> 00:50:14.750
destroyed, either partially or
completely, by the air strikes.

00:50:14.750 --> 00:50:19.370
Just in one night, the 24th
of July, five hospitals out

00:50:19.370 --> 00:50:23.660
of the 10 functioning hospitals
in Aleppo were destroyed.

00:50:23.660 --> 00:50:27.135
And just to imagine
yourself in this hospital,

00:50:27.135 --> 00:50:33.600
quickly, this is one
hospital in Aleppo.

00:50:33.600 --> 00:50:36.700
So while the patients
are getting treatment,

00:50:36.700 --> 00:50:38.340
the hospital is being targeted.

00:50:38.340 --> 00:50:42.570
And this hospital was targeted
three times in July just,

00:50:42.570 --> 00:50:44.803
and this hospital went
out of service completely.

00:50:48.640 --> 00:50:50.640
Just quickly, because
we're running out of time,

00:50:50.640 --> 00:50:52.800
education is the same story.

00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:55.950
This hospital is our Safe
Children support Hospital

00:50:55.950 --> 00:50:56.940
in [INAUDIBLE].

00:50:56.940 --> 00:50:58.990
It was targeted three times.

00:50:58.990 --> 00:51:02.490
Each time we
rehabilitated the school,

00:51:02.490 --> 00:51:05.950
and the school was
targeted again and again.

00:51:05.950 --> 00:51:08.510
So why do people
flee out of Syria?

00:51:08.510 --> 00:51:10.040
My opinion is three reasons.

00:51:10.040 --> 00:51:12.130
Violence, which we talked about.

00:51:12.130 --> 00:51:13.580
Basic life services--
if you don't

00:51:13.580 --> 00:51:18.300
have water, food, medical help,
for sure, you will not stay.

00:51:18.300 --> 00:51:20.770
And personal documentation,
which is an interesting one.

00:51:20.770 --> 00:51:22.650
Because people in
the opposition areas,

00:51:22.650 --> 00:51:24.470
they don't have access
to the government

00:51:24.470 --> 00:51:26.430
and they don't have
any representation.

00:51:26.430 --> 00:51:29.580
So they cannot get
birth registrations,

00:51:29.580 --> 00:51:31.210
death registrations,
or passports.

00:51:31.210 --> 00:51:34.130
So they seek asylum
to have documents

00:51:34.130 --> 00:51:36.380
showing their identity.

00:51:36.380 --> 00:51:40.050
And then, solutions.

00:51:40.050 --> 00:51:44.130
Is the solution by asking
countries to absorb more?

00:51:44.130 --> 00:51:45.950
I hope it's just the
temporary solution,

00:51:45.950 --> 00:51:49.360
because Syria is losing their
people, doctors, teachers,

00:51:49.360 --> 00:51:51.740
who are supposed to
build the country again.

00:51:51.740 --> 00:51:53.520
We were able to do
a lot, and we are

00:51:53.520 --> 00:51:56.790
able to do a lot in Syria--
vaccination hospitals,

00:51:56.790 --> 00:52:00.520
schools, even without
electricity, around candles,

00:52:00.520 --> 00:52:06.200
and some spaces among the
violence for children to play.

00:52:06.200 --> 00:52:11.750
But we were not able to fund all
our humanitarian response plan,

00:52:11.750 --> 00:52:15.480
and we do have to
have a lot of advocacy

00:52:15.480 --> 00:52:17.490
to build this
common understanding

00:52:17.490 --> 00:52:18.630
of the Syrian crisis.

00:52:18.630 --> 00:52:21.130
And finally, to strengthen
Syrian civil society,

00:52:21.130 --> 00:52:24.120
because it is the
best way to-- having

00:52:24.120 --> 00:52:25.940
the structure of
this community again,

00:52:25.940 --> 00:52:28.840
hopefully, again
later will be a merge

00:52:28.840 --> 00:52:30.900
between the civil society
in the regime area

00:52:30.900 --> 00:52:33.260
and the civil society
in the opposition area.

00:52:33.260 --> 00:52:37.940
And we had many good
examples of associations

00:52:37.940 --> 00:52:41.140
where we are able to establish
this Idlib [INAUDIBLE]

00:52:41.140 --> 00:52:44.650
and Idlib Governorate managing
all these health centers,

00:52:44.650 --> 00:52:48.460
and a lot of Syrian
NGOs managing up to 23

00:52:48.460 --> 00:52:50.770
million operations in Syria.

00:52:50.770 --> 00:52:51.600
Thank you.

00:52:51.600 --> 00:52:54.050
[APPLAUSE]

00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:06.040
-Well, thank you so
much for having me here.

00:53:06.040 --> 00:53:07.720
I feel like I'm with
all these scholars,

00:53:07.720 --> 00:53:12.990
and I'm just a photographer,
so instead of-- my research

00:53:12.990 --> 00:53:16.710
basically is really my
personal impressions.

00:53:16.710 --> 00:53:20.720
I'm originally from Lebanon,
from Palestinian parents,

00:53:20.720 --> 00:53:24.580
and I came to the US to go to
college, to study architecture.

00:53:24.580 --> 00:53:27.360
I really became a photographer
after September 11,

00:53:27.360 --> 00:53:30.000
because I wanted to tell a
different story of the Middle

00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:30.500
East.

00:53:30.500 --> 00:53:35.390
It felt like the news was always
them and us, and I'm like,

00:53:35.390 --> 00:53:39.200
I am them and us, and it
was very personal to me.

00:53:39.200 --> 00:53:42.240
So I've been focusing in my
work mainly on women and girls,

00:53:42.240 --> 00:53:45.020
and on focusing on our
universality and sameness.

00:53:45.020 --> 00:53:51.970
But in 2014, way before we all
heard about the refugee crisis,

00:53:51.970 --> 00:53:55.770
the Syrian crisis in
Europe and internationally,

00:53:55.770 --> 00:53:57.540
Lebanon was dealing with that.

00:53:57.540 --> 00:54:02.740
And I really was not actually
looking for it or anything,

00:54:02.740 --> 00:54:04.660
but I was walking on
the streets of Beirut,

00:54:04.660 --> 00:54:08.040
and it felt like there
were Syrian kids just

00:54:08.040 --> 00:54:11.060
about at every corner
begging for money,

00:54:11.060 --> 00:54:13.580
selling Kleenex,
or shining shoes,

00:54:13.580 --> 00:54:19.510
and there was something very
utterly disturbing about it.

00:54:19.510 --> 00:54:22.190
Lebanon is a country of about
4 and 1/2 million people.

00:54:22.190 --> 00:54:27.380
They say now there's maybe 1
and 1/2 million refugees, some

00:54:27.380 --> 00:54:28.460
of them not registered.

00:54:28.460 --> 00:54:30.000
So my numbers
might not be right,

00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:32.830
but this is the perception.

00:54:32.830 --> 00:54:35.690
Lebanon has its own issues,
economically and politically.

00:54:35.690 --> 00:54:39.651
There hasn't been a
president in over two years.

00:54:39.651 --> 00:54:41.900
Even though many people are
really opening their doors

00:54:41.900 --> 00:54:44.690
and helping the refugees,
people are also fed up.

00:54:44.690 --> 00:54:47.920
So they make them move
away from their storefronts

00:54:47.920 --> 00:54:51.460
and ask them to go
step somewhere else.

00:54:51.460 --> 00:54:54.510
I started talking
to one boy, and he

00:54:54.510 --> 00:54:58.000
was 14, which in
2014, that was the age

00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:00.780
of my son at that point,
and he looked like my son.

00:55:00.780 --> 00:55:03.430
And there was something
so disturbing,

00:55:03.430 --> 00:55:05.310
that this kid
should be at school.

00:55:05.310 --> 00:55:09.030
That's not him, but I'm making
the intro to this project.

00:55:09.030 --> 00:55:11.290
This kid should be at school
and not on the street.

00:55:11.290 --> 00:55:14.330
And I realized that they were
happy to be paid attention to,

00:55:14.330 --> 00:55:19.080
so I started photographing
the kids individually.

00:55:19.080 --> 00:55:23.100
And I feel like when you
hear about the millions,

00:55:23.100 --> 00:55:27.300
it almost becomes abstract
and unattainable as a number.

00:55:27.300 --> 00:55:31.380
So I'm trying to photograph
each kid by himself or herself,

00:55:31.380 --> 00:55:35.490
and give them their identity
and their dignity back.

00:55:35.490 --> 00:55:38.560
So I'm photographing them
just like in all of my work.

00:55:38.560 --> 00:55:39.970
I focus on girls and women.

00:55:39.970 --> 00:55:43.990
I'm photographing them with
the same focus and attention

00:55:43.990 --> 00:55:46.530
that I would give anybody else.

00:55:46.530 --> 00:55:50.010
What was interesting is I found,
as well, that all of these kids

00:55:50.010 --> 00:55:52.094
were standing-- because
they were pushed away.

00:55:52.094 --> 00:55:53.760
They wanted to be in
the areas of Beirut

00:55:53.760 --> 00:55:55.980
where there would be
traffic and money,

00:55:55.980 --> 00:55:57.650
but they were always
often pushed away

00:55:57.650 --> 00:55:58.770
from the storefronts.

00:55:58.770 --> 00:56:00.670
And there was something
very fascinating,

00:56:00.670 --> 00:56:04.180
that they often stood in
front of these walls that

00:56:04.180 --> 00:56:07.340
were covered with
graffiti, or billboards,

00:56:07.340 --> 00:56:08.780
or different announcements.

00:56:08.780 --> 00:56:11.980
And it felt like these walls
were breathing history,

00:56:11.980 --> 00:56:17.140
and they had all these
layers, layers of history.

00:56:17.140 --> 00:56:20.810
And for me, these kids became
just an anonymous layer

00:56:20.810 --> 00:56:26.270
on these walls, and there was
something very sad about it.

00:56:26.270 --> 00:56:29.270
So I'm going to go through the
photos and show some of them.

00:56:29.270 --> 00:56:32.720
I mean I have their
names and their ages.

00:56:32.720 --> 00:56:34.270
They were telling
me their stories.

00:56:34.270 --> 00:56:36.150
But I have to say
all the stories,

00:56:36.150 --> 00:56:38.270
sadly, blended
into one big story.

00:56:38.270 --> 00:56:41.442
They were incredibly similar.

00:56:41.442 --> 00:56:42.900
Most of them would
say their father

00:56:42.900 --> 00:56:44.940
is either dead or fighting.

00:56:44.940 --> 00:56:47.660
They didn't even know which
side he's fighting with.

00:56:47.660 --> 00:56:50.460
But the mothers were either
begging on some other street

00:56:50.460 --> 00:56:55.240
corner, or at home, staying
with some family members.

00:56:55.240 --> 00:56:58.350
So these kids have been
basically on the streets,

00:56:58.350 --> 00:57:00.440
as far as I know, since 2014.

00:57:00.440 --> 00:57:01.210
Probably earlier.

00:57:01.210 --> 00:57:03.540
That's when I started
doing this project.

00:57:07.630 --> 00:57:09.500
And I found them
extreme dignified

00:57:09.500 --> 00:57:10.542
when I photographed them.

00:57:10.542 --> 00:57:12.291
I'm just going to tell
the story of-- this

00:57:12.291 --> 00:57:13.770
is brand new from
this past summer.

00:57:13.770 --> 00:57:15.900
I was actually running
in the morning,

00:57:15.900 --> 00:57:17.570
and I passed that
young woman, who

00:57:17.570 --> 00:57:19.335
I found stunningly beautiful.

00:57:19.335 --> 00:57:20.710
And I don't know
how much you can

00:57:20.710 --> 00:57:23.860
tell in the photo-- her
face was peeling, completely

00:57:23.860 --> 00:57:25.280
burnt from the sun.

00:57:25.280 --> 00:57:28.410
So I stopped and
started talking to her,

00:57:28.410 --> 00:57:30.790
and I decided that
I wanted to go back.

00:57:30.790 --> 00:57:33.950
I asked her where she would be,
and I went back, got the car,

00:57:33.950 --> 00:57:37.030
got my camera, got her
sunscreen, and looked for her.

00:57:37.030 --> 00:57:39.910
And so I wanted to
take her back to where

00:57:39.910 --> 00:57:42.880
I had found her, because I
found her in a different spot.

00:57:42.880 --> 00:57:46.360
And she got in the car with
me, which in and by itself

00:57:46.360 --> 00:57:47.990
I found even more disturbing.

00:57:47.990 --> 00:57:50.280
And I told her, you know
what, I'm OK, I'm a mom,

00:57:50.280 --> 00:57:53.180
I have a daughter your
age, but you should not

00:57:53.180 --> 00:57:54.290
get into people's cars.

00:57:54.290 --> 00:57:58.200
I get the chills when
I tell that story.

00:57:58.200 --> 00:58:03.420
I realized how vulnerable
all these kids are.

00:58:03.420 --> 00:58:09.790
So I'm going to go through
them, because I also realized--

00:58:09.790 --> 00:58:11.947
and if you see-- oh,
it's not in this one.

00:58:11.947 --> 00:58:14.030
I have another one of her
where you could actually

00:58:14.030 --> 00:58:15.040
see the money.

00:58:15.040 --> 00:58:18.816
This is a shoe shining equipment
that they carry around all day.

00:58:24.410 --> 00:58:29.000
And this girl's
name was Maya, which

00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:31.410
is the name of my daughter,
so I have to say--

00:58:31.410 --> 00:58:33.300
and I saw her
again a year later,

00:58:33.300 --> 00:58:36.490
which made me happy
and sad, because it

00:58:36.490 --> 00:58:38.800
meant she's still on
the street, but it also

00:58:38.800 --> 00:58:42.240
meant that she was OK.

00:58:42.240 --> 00:58:46.955
And then I started realizing--
I don't know if going too fast.

00:58:46.955 --> 00:58:48.580
I kind of want to
make it through them.

00:58:51.120 --> 00:58:53.754
Here you can see the
money in her hand.

00:58:53.754 --> 00:58:55.420
I don't know if you
can see it up there,

00:58:55.420 --> 00:58:58.440
but she's holding the
money in her hand.

00:58:58.440 --> 00:59:00.910
This is the young-- then I
realized there was something

00:59:00.910 --> 00:59:04.420
that a lot of these-- some
of these Syrian refugees

00:59:04.420 --> 00:59:07.510
were actually even staying
in Palestinian refugee camps,

00:59:07.510 --> 00:59:08.954
which in and by
itself-- I'm going

00:59:08.954 --> 00:59:10.870
to show some of those
photos, because this was

00:59:10.870 --> 00:59:15.990
the focus of my earlier work--
the refugee camps are in very

00:59:15.990 --> 00:59:18.180
dire, terrible condition.

00:59:18.180 --> 00:59:21.110
And as somebody said
before me, there's

00:59:21.110 --> 00:59:23.820
about half a million
Palestinian refugees.

00:59:23.820 --> 00:59:27.590
But this is a very different
story, because over there now

00:59:27.590 --> 00:59:29.560
it's like third and
fourth generations that

00:59:29.560 --> 00:59:31.010
are being born.

00:59:31.010 --> 00:59:33.000
But now, so there are
some Syrian refugees

00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:35.530
in the Palestinian refugee
camp, making the whole thing

00:59:35.530 --> 00:59:37.630
a lot more complicated.

00:59:37.630 --> 00:59:39.620
So this is what I'm
showing for that series,

00:59:39.620 --> 00:59:41.440
but as we're talking
about refugees,

00:59:41.440 --> 00:59:43.750
and the reason why
Lebanon did not

00:59:43.750 --> 00:59:45.980
want to build camps for
the Syrian refugees,

00:59:45.980 --> 00:59:49.520
is when they did build camps
for the Palestinian refugees,

00:59:49.520 --> 00:59:51.880
the camps became permanent.

00:59:51.880 --> 00:59:55.030
So what was supposed to
be a temporary structure,

00:59:55.030 --> 00:59:58.860
now, 68 years later,
these camps are there,

00:59:58.860 --> 01:00:00.680
they're overpopulated,
and they're

01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:02.720
in pretty terrible condition.

01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:06.040
So this is actually the
ID card of this woman,

01:00:06.040 --> 01:00:11.720
and you can see how young she
was when she became a refugee.

01:00:11.720 --> 01:00:14.340
And this is the only
piece of paper she has,

01:00:14.340 --> 01:00:16.250
so she does not
have a citizenship.

01:00:16.250 --> 01:00:19.680
Her paper is her refugee card.

01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:21.980
And I'm just showing the
different generations.

01:00:21.980 --> 01:00:23.550
I'm going to go through those.

01:00:23.550 --> 01:00:25.800
This is in the
Palestinian refugee camp,

01:00:25.800 --> 01:00:27.690
and these are
Palestinian refugees,

01:00:27.690 --> 01:00:31.820
but I guess it's--
people make a life.

01:00:31.820 --> 01:00:35.100
So the difference is these
kids, now there's a system.

01:00:35.100 --> 01:00:37.660
There's a school
within the camps there,

01:00:37.660 --> 01:00:40.840
so at least they're going to
school, and the structure--

01:00:40.840 --> 01:00:42.740
the permanency of it
made it that there

01:00:42.740 --> 01:00:46.860
is kind of a life
that's not normal,

01:00:46.860 --> 01:00:49.574
but that at least the kids are
getting some kind of education,

01:00:49.574 --> 01:00:50.865
and they're not on the streets.

01:00:56.750 --> 01:00:59.020
For me, when I
started this work,

01:00:59.020 --> 01:01:02.860
it was really for me to focus
on the universality, as well.

01:01:02.860 --> 01:01:05.322
Like you know, at the end
of the day, she's a mom

01:01:05.322 --> 01:01:07.280
and she's nursing her
baby, and there's nothing

01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:08.705
more universal than that.

01:01:12.070 --> 01:01:14.810
And here, I'm
showing to two girls.

01:01:14.810 --> 01:01:16.190
This is kind of their house.

01:01:16.190 --> 01:01:18.750
And here you have
the older ladies.

01:01:18.750 --> 01:01:23.820
For me, it's like the girls
are going to turn into that.

01:01:23.820 --> 01:01:26.850
So I'm just showing
a couple of those,

01:01:26.850 --> 01:01:31.240
because I did work on
younger prepubescent girls,

01:01:31.240 --> 01:01:33.940
and I was photographing girls--
I was inspired by my daughter.

01:01:33.940 --> 01:01:35.570
I was photographing
girls in the US,

01:01:35.570 --> 01:01:37.580
and I decided I
wanted to include

01:01:37.580 --> 01:01:40.510
refugee girls, Palestinian
girls, Syrian girls, and girls

01:01:40.510 --> 01:01:45.700
from Lebanon, because there's
a universality of growing up.

01:01:45.700 --> 01:01:47.680
And so I'm showing
some of those.

01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:50.520
And it's important for
me to put a face on them

01:01:50.520 --> 01:01:53.000
and to see the beauty,
that these refugees

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.250
are girls before anything else.

01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:02.380
And this, I'm doing a project
on mothers and daughters,

01:02:02.380 --> 01:02:06.070
and this is a brand new
picture from this summer.

01:02:06.070 --> 01:02:10.140
For me, if you see the
nails on the daughters,

01:02:10.140 --> 01:02:13.350
every nail is different,
it's like, she's 20.

01:02:13.350 --> 01:02:15.430
She's like any 20-year-old.

01:02:15.430 --> 01:02:17.240
Her dreams are ahead of her.

01:02:17.240 --> 01:02:20.820
And this is her mom, and you'd
be shocked when you found out

01:02:20.820 --> 01:02:21.730
how old she is.

01:02:21.730 --> 01:02:24.376
The mom is 43 years old.

01:02:24.376 --> 01:02:27.040
I am nine years older
than this woman,

01:02:27.040 --> 01:02:29.830
and she was treating me
like one of her daughters.

01:02:29.830 --> 01:02:33.860
So there was something about the
permanency of life as a refugee

01:02:33.860 --> 01:02:37.350
where, at some
point, your dreams

01:02:37.350 --> 01:02:39.160
become-- the reality sinks in.

01:02:47.510 --> 01:02:49.720
I believe this is the last one.

01:02:49.720 --> 01:02:50.800
Oh, sorry.

01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:53.400
Now I'm trying-- again, it's
about the passing of time,

01:02:53.400 --> 01:02:57.190
so this is a 12-year-old girl
in a Palestinian refugee camp.

01:02:57.190 --> 01:03:01.650
This is now that same
girl four years later.

01:03:01.650 --> 01:03:09.910
And that again, this is Danya at
nine, and this again her at 13.

01:03:09.910 --> 01:03:12.830
I'm just trying to
show that time goes by,

01:03:12.830 --> 01:03:17.300
and life is still the
same for many people.

01:03:17.300 --> 01:03:18.950
I'm just showing this trend.

01:03:18.950 --> 01:03:20.440
This is a Syrian refugee girl.

01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:24.320
And I felt like for me, one
way of trying to give back,

01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:26.280
I work with a gallery
and we decided

01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:28.340
to make an additional
50 of this print,

01:03:28.340 --> 01:03:31.960
and all the money that
we make off this print

01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:33.900
is going to the Karam
Foundation, which

01:03:33.900 --> 01:03:36.569
is a-- I think they
do admirable work.

01:03:36.569 --> 01:03:38.110
They're based in
Chicago, and they've

01:03:38.110 --> 01:03:39.700
been helping Syrian
refugees, so I

01:03:39.700 --> 01:03:42.390
thought I would just show that.

01:03:42.390 --> 01:03:44.330
I'm sorry if I went too
fast, but this clock

01:03:44.330 --> 01:03:45.720
is haunting me here.

01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:46.693
[LAUGHTER]

01:03:46.693 --> 01:03:47.193
Thanks.

01:03:47.193 --> 01:03:49.648
[APPLAUSE]

01:03:58.472 --> 01:03:59.180
-Is this working?

01:03:59.180 --> 01:03:59.680
Yes.

01:03:59.680 --> 01:04:04.450
Well, thank you for those
very compelling presentations.

01:04:04.450 --> 01:04:05.690
I'm sorry we had to rush you.

01:04:05.690 --> 01:04:08.370
Each of you could have taken
up the whole time we have,

01:04:08.370 --> 01:04:09.620
and we would have loved it.

01:04:09.620 --> 01:04:13.200
But in the meantime,
we've really

01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:14.390
learned so much from you.

01:04:14.390 --> 01:04:20.150
So I just wanted to start with
a couple of general questions,

01:04:20.150 --> 01:04:22.290
really.

01:04:22.290 --> 01:04:25.940
And then maybe one or
two pointed questions

01:04:25.940 --> 01:04:28.940
to some of you, and then open
the floor for discussion.

01:04:28.940 --> 01:04:31.900
So the first observation
and question is this.

01:04:31.900 --> 01:04:37.130
As Susan said, it's ironic
that the countries that

01:04:37.130 --> 01:04:44.300
are doing the most to
shelter, protect, and help

01:04:44.300 --> 01:04:48.430
Syrian refugees are
countries that have not

01:04:48.430 --> 01:04:53.290
signed the Refugee Convention,
that have no legal obligation

01:04:53.290 --> 01:04:58.220
to provide the hospitality
that they're providing.

01:04:58.220 --> 01:05:04.960
So I wonder what that says about
our international architecture,

01:05:04.960 --> 01:05:08.770
and what it says about how we
should think moving forward

01:05:08.770 --> 01:05:11.580
about the agreements
that we are seeking

01:05:11.580 --> 01:05:14.120
to develop and to undertake.

01:05:14.120 --> 01:05:18.310
And in particular, when we think
about increasing resettlement,

01:05:18.310 --> 01:05:22.390
and when we think about moving
towards new architecture

01:05:22.390 --> 01:05:26.200
for migration, what does the
current situation teach us?

01:05:26.200 --> 01:05:28.070
And maybe, Noel,
I'll start with you,

01:05:28.070 --> 01:05:31.630
because I know you've
thought a lot about the lack

01:05:31.630 --> 01:05:34.920
of a proper framework.

01:05:34.920 --> 01:05:38.300
But what is this
glaring reality?

01:05:38.300 --> 01:05:38.990
Tell us.

01:05:38.990 --> 01:05:41.470
Here we have
countries like Hungary

01:05:41.470 --> 01:05:44.130
and the Czech Republic that
have ratified the Refugee

01:05:44.130 --> 01:05:46.610
Convention, it was a necessary
condition of them joining

01:05:46.610 --> 01:05:49.260
the EU, and they
are openly saying

01:05:49.260 --> 01:05:52.470
they don't want any refugees,
they don't want any Muslims.

01:05:52.470 --> 01:05:54.230
And at the same time
we have countries

01:05:54.230 --> 01:05:57.820
like Lebanon and
Jordan, as we've heard,

01:05:57.820 --> 01:06:01.380
that have not only been
hosting refugees for decades,

01:06:01.380 --> 01:06:03.000
but that actually
haven't signed on

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:06.130
to the international
treaty that provides

01:06:06.130 --> 01:06:07.590
a basis for protection.

01:06:07.590 --> 01:06:11.820
So what does that
make you think about,

01:06:11.820 --> 01:06:14.553
in terms of next steps
for legal architecture?

01:06:25.380 --> 01:06:29.930
148 states have signed the
1951 Refugee Convention,

01:06:29.930 --> 01:06:33.940
and it's true that many states,
especially surrounding Syria,

01:06:33.940 --> 01:06:35.770
have not signed.

01:06:35.770 --> 01:06:38.140
That is mainly to
do, historically,

01:06:38.140 --> 01:06:42.320
with the unresolved issue of
the refugees from Palestine.

01:06:42.320 --> 01:06:46.000
And I think we
should all-- Rania

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.380
had spoken about the
refugees from Palestine--

01:06:48.380 --> 01:06:54.000
that unresolved refugee
situation for 67 years

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:57.230
is a major issue
within the Middle East.

01:06:57.230 --> 01:07:00.650
And it is a barrier for
many of those states

01:07:00.650 --> 01:07:04.530
to accede to the
Refugee Convention.

01:07:04.530 --> 01:07:08.120
However, that being said, we
see that many of the states,

01:07:08.120 --> 01:07:10.300
and in many General
Assembly resolutions,

01:07:10.300 --> 01:07:12.830
we talk about the
extremely generous approach

01:07:12.830 --> 01:07:15.630
of many countries
who host refugees,

01:07:15.630 --> 01:07:19.820
albeit not being signatories
to the Refugee Convention.

01:07:19.820 --> 01:07:24.205
The idea is really to
build on the Convention,

01:07:24.205 --> 01:07:28.660
and not to dismantle it,
because it has actually

01:07:28.660 --> 01:07:29.940
stood the test of time.

01:07:29.940 --> 01:07:33.400
It has offered
protection to millions.

01:07:33.400 --> 01:07:37.290
But to build on it and
really focus on this issue

01:07:37.290 --> 01:07:41.250
of responsibility sharing.

01:07:41.250 --> 01:07:44.130
It is mentioned, this concept
of international cooperation

01:07:44.130 --> 01:07:46.370
is in the 1951 Convention.

01:07:46.370 --> 01:07:48.780
It's mentioned in
the preamble that we

01:07:48.780 --> 01:07:52.010
need international
cooperation to alleviate

01:07:52.010 --> 01:07:54.850
the burden of hosting refugees.

01:07:54.850 --> 01:07:58.070
But the systems for
doing that, we've had,

01:07:58.070 --> 01:08:01.650
I think as Susan mentioned,
different comprehensive refugee

01:08:01.650 --> 01:08:05.660
responses to the
Vietnamese refugee crisis,

01:08:05.660 --> 01:08:08.750
to the Central American
refugee crisis.

01:08:08.750 --> 01:08:11.590
But we need to do that,
not on an ad hoc basis,

01:08:11.590 --> 01:08:13.660
but on a much more
systematic basis.

01:08:13.660 --> 01:08:15.640
And that's what
we're working toward.

01:08:15.640 --> 01:08:19.359
We didn't get all the way there
in a summer of negotiations,

01:08:19.359 --> 01:08:22.380
especially in the
summer of 2016,

01:08:22.380 --> 01:08:27.210
where the political climate
was really not very auspicious

01:08:27.210 --> 01:08:28.899
for the negotiations.

01:08:28.899 --> 01:08:32.700
But we have now a commitment
of states to work toward that.

01:08:32.700 --> 01:08:36.260
And I think the challenge for
all of us, and for all of you,

01:08:36.260 --> 01:08:38.470
is to keep the pressure on.

01:08:38.470 --> 01:08:40.720
We have political space,
we have an opening

01:08:40.720 --> 01:08:43.359
to work toward a better
responsibility sharing.

01:08:43.359 --> 01:08:46.500
We need the policy ideas, we
need the focus and commitment

01:08:46.500 --> 01:08:48.419
to get all the way there.

01:08:48.419 --> 01:08:49.210
-Thank you so much.

01:08:49.210 --> 01:08:51.720
Susan, did you want
to add anything?

01:08:51.720 --> 01:08:53.790
-Yeah, I think there's
really two responses

01:08:53.790 --> 01:08:57.410
that I have to that, picking
up on what Noel said.

01:08:57.410 --> 01:09:04.810
The first is the observation of
how interdependent both refugee

01:09:04.810 --> 01:09:08.000
crises are one to
the other, and how

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:11.830
interdependent all states
are on each other's response

01:09:11.830 --> 01:09:14.029
to a refugee crisis.

01:09:14.029 --> 01:09:19.649
And I think states that continue
to pretend that they can

01:09:19.649 --> 01:09:23.130
insulate themselves,
and somehow push

01:09:23.130 --> 01:09:27.260
a crisis onto another state,
even a neighboring state,

01:09:27.260 --> 01:09:29.220
are really fooling themselves.

01:09:29.220 --> 01:09:31.930
I think that time has gone.

01:09:31.930 --> 01:09:36.760
And the pressure needs
to be on reinserting

01:09:36.760 --> 01:09:41.100
in the political dialogue
the legal dialogue.

01:09:41.100 --> 01:09:44.390
Because you hear all of the
politicians talking about,

01:09:44.390 --> 01:09:47.260
well, we don't have to do this
or we don't have to do that.

01:09:47.260 --> 01:09:50.160
But in fact, they
have bound themselves

01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:55.860
to legal obligations, and
so that must mean something.

01:09:55.860 --> 01:09:57.860
And it is, of course,
up to civil society

01:09:57.860 --> 01:10:00.550
to hold our own
states accountable

01:10:00.550 --> 01:10:02.765
to their legal obligations.

01:10:05.290 --> 01:10:11.050
And I think the second piece
is the question of enforcement

01:10:11.050 --> 01:10:14.140
that plagues all of
international law,

01:10:14.140 --> 01:10:16.930
but it particularly
plagues refugee law.

01:10:16.930 --> 01:10:20.140
And there is a provision
in the Refugee Convention

01:10:20.140 --> 01:10:24.110
that permits states
to take violations

01:10:24.110 --> 01:10:27.160
of the convention
against another state

01:10:27.160 --> 01:10:29.420
to the International
Court of Justice.

01:10:29.420 --> 01:10:30.800
Surprise, surprise,
there's never

01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:33.520
been such a case brought to the
International Court of Justice,

01:10:33.520 --> 01:10:35.810
but perhaps it's time.

01:10:35.810 --> 01:10:40.820
And I have been privy to
conversations among refugee law

01:10:40.820 --> 01:10:43.140
adjudicators, and
many of them talk

01:10:43.140 --> 01:10:47.000
about the need for a separate
international refugee

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:50.320
law, refugee tribunal.

01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:53.420
And that's coming from
adjudicators, which I

01:10:53.420 --> 01:10:55.310
think is extremely interesting.

01:10:55.310 --> 01:10:57.465
So on the one hand,
this interdependence--

01:10:57.465 --> 01:10:59.570
you know, we've been
talking about the fact

01:10:59.570 --> 01:11:02.800
that all of the
Middle Eastern states

01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:05.800
are persistent objectors to
the refugee regime because

01:11:05.800 --> 01:11:07.920
of the experience
with the Palestinians.

01:11:07.920 --> 01:11:11.260
So that experience has
colored their attitude

01:11:11.260 --> 01:11:14.080
towards all later
coming refugees.

01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:17.310
And so without dealing with
the Palestinian question,

01:11:17.310 --> 01:11:20.810
it isn't going to be possible
to change those states' attitude

01:11:20.810 --> 01:11:23.590
towards the refugee regime.

01:11:23.590 --> 01:11:29.850
So I think moving the
discussion from the political

01:11:29.850 --> 01:11:34.620
to the legal, putting the legal
obligations front and center,

01:11:34.620 --> 01:11:38.020
and then trying to address
some of these major gaps that

01:11:38.020 --> 01:11:43.130
would make the protection regime
that we have much more robust.

01:11:43.130 --> 01:11:45.660
-But I wonder if I could
just press you a little bit.

01:11:45.660 --> 01:11:50.300
You said in your remarks
that there's an obligation

01:11:50.300 --> 01:11:53.090
to establish a comprehensive
plan of action,

01:11:53.090 --> 01:11:57.760
and you rightly refer to the
history from Vietnam and so on.

01:11:57.760 --> 01:12:00.989
But why is there
such an obligation,

01:12:00.989 --> 01:12:02.530
where does that
obligation inhere in,

01:12:02.530 --> 01:12:05.860
and who is in a
position to impose it?

01:12:05.860 --> 01:12:10.660
My sense is that
there's extremely little

01:12:10.660 --> 01:12:12.750
political will,
not even to agree

01:12:12.750 --> 01:12:19.450
on a compact of the kind
of fairly bland version

01:12:19.450 --> 01:12:22.160
that was set out in the
Secretary General's background

01:12:22.160 --> 01:12:24.670
paper for the 19th
of September meeting,

01:12:24.670 --> 01:12:28.210
so where would we get the
political will for a CPA,

01:12:28.210 --> 01:12:32.390
and how should we, as concerned
members of civil society,

01:12:32.390 --> 01:12:34.790
be trying to build towards that?

01:12:34.790 --> 01:12:38.920
So any thoughts on that?

01:12:38.920 --> 01:12:42.730
-So that's really two questions,
and one is the political will,

01:12:42.730 --> 01:12:46.770
the other is where does the
legal obligation come from.

01:12:46.770 --> 01:12:49.610
Of course, in international law,
one of the strongest sources

01:12:49.610 --> 01:12:53.690
of law is customary law, that
is the practice of states.

01:12:53.690 --> 01:12:56.510
And so we can see
responsibility sharing

01:12:56.510 --> 01:12:59.460
as a complex set
of obligations that

01:12:59.460 --> 01:13:02.870
have become the practice of
states in major refugee crises,

01:13:02.870 --> 01:13:07.440
starting from the 1970s CPA
in the Indo-Chinese situation,

01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:12.110
building on that in the later
'70s and '80s [INAUDIBLE]

01:13:12.110 --> 01:13:14.790
and the Great Lakes
Comprehensive Plan of Action,

01:13:14.790 --> 01:13:19.360
and then a very recent one
in the former Soviet Union,

01:13:19.360 --> 01:13:21.910
the CIS Comprehensive
Plan of Action.

01:13:21.910 --> 01:13:24.600
So we are actually
finding states responding

01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:26.960
in more and more
sophisticated ways,

01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:29.920
and they're building on
formal legal obligations,

01:13:29.920 --> 01:13:32.610
not just from the Refugee
Convention, but from,

01:13:32.610 --> 01:13:35.010
for example, the
temporary protection norm,

01:13:35.010 --> 01:13:37.890
which has now become
formalized almost everywhere.

01:13:37.890 --> 01:13:40.080
In the US, we have
temporary protected status

01:13:40.080 --> 01:13:42.700
built into our Immigration
Nationality Act.

01:13:42.700 --> 01:13:45.050
In Europe, we have
the EU-wide directive

01:13:45.050 --> 01:13:47.720
on temporary protection,
that should, by the way,

01:13:47.720 --> 01:13:50.220
be triggered by
the Syrian crisis,

01:13:50.220 --> 01:13:52.550
because it's precisely
this kind of crisis that

01:13:52.550 --> 01:13:55.980
should trigger the directive.

01:13:55.980 --> 01:14:00.560
So it's a multi-layered,
complex response

01:14:00.560 --> 01:14:04.800
that I would argue is now
formalized as state practice.

01:14:04.800 --> 01:14:08.760
And I think it's customary
international law.

01:14:08.760 --> 01:14:10.810
Now, where should it come from?

01:14:10.810 --> 01:14:13.400
Like most of the other
comprehensive plans of actions,

01:14:13.400 --> 01:14:15.550
they've been driven
by the UNHCR,

01:14:15.550 --> 01:14:18.220
by putting a
formula on the table

01:14:18.220 --> 01:14:21.540
and then pressing
states to begin

01:14:21.540 --> 01:14:27.110
a rather complex short and
longer-term admission process,

01:14:27.110 --> 01:14:31.150
and dividing up
responsibility in that way.

01:14:31.150 --> 01:14:32.930
I think it's not a mystery.

01:14:32.930 --> 01:14:35.450
We have to generate
the political will.

01:14:35.450 --> 01:14:38.380
But I think the legal obligation
is now, at this point,

01:14:38.380 --> 01:14:41.530
quite clear.

01:14:41.530 --> 01:14:46.220
-Let me switch a little bit
from the policy and legal

01:14:46.220 --> 01:14:49.550
to the more human and
humanitarian side of things.

01:14:49.550 --> 01:14:52.220
So Abdulkarim, I
wanted to ask you,

01:14:52.220 --> 01:14:55.960
you showed some of the images
of the bombing of hospitals,

01:14:55.960 --> 01:14:59.120
and several of us
here, just actually

01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:02.370
in Boston in the last few
days have been to talks

01:15:02.370 --> 01:15:05.860
given by doctors from
Syria documenting

01:15:05.860 --> 01:15:08.130
unbelievable attacks.

01:15:08.130 --> 01:15:10.870
According to one surgeon,
every single hospital in Syria

01:15:10.870 --> 01:15:12.590
has been bombed at least once.

01:15:12.590 --> 01:15:20.240
And he also said that now
people in the rebel groups,

01:15:20.240 --> 01:15:23.340
or in the opposition groups,
are saying to the doctors

01:15:23.340 --> 01:15:25.340
and to the medical
personnel, please

01:15:25.340 --> 01:15:27.340
don't come near us, because
if you come near us,

01:15:27.340 --> 01:15:29.240
we're definitely
going to be a target.

01:15:29.240 --> 01:15:31.680
So how do you explain that?

01:15:31.680 --> 01:15:33.750
Why do you think
that's happening?

01:15:33.750 --> 01:15:36.320
I'd just be interested to know.

01:15:36.320 --> 01:15:39.900
Not only is it such a
fundamental and gross violation

01:15:39.900 --> 01:15:43.820
of international
norms, it's also--

01:15:43.820 --> 01:15:45.320
and please correct
me if I'm wrong--

01:15:45.320 --> 01:15:47.150
but I think it's
pretty unprecedented.

01:15:47.150 --> 01:15:51.480
This degree of
willful destruction

01:15:51.480 --> 01:15:55.730
of bonafide medical
services that are neutrally

01:15:55.730 --> 01:15:58.770
administering medical help to
both sides in the conflict,

01:15:58.770 --> 01:16:00.790
admitting anybody who
needs medical care.

01:16:00.790 --> 01:16:02.880
How do you, as
someone who's actually

01:16:02.880 --> 01:16:04.611
going in and out
of Syria, dealing

01:16:04.611 --> 01:16:06.860
with the humanitarian crisis,
how do you explain this?

01:16:06.860 --> 01:16:09.070
Why are people-- what
do people say about

01:16:09.070 --> 01:16:10.705
this specific targeting?

01:16:14.392 --> 01:16:16.600
-Actually, starting from
the beginning of the crisis,

01:16:16.600 --> 01:16:18.990
there was enormous pressure
on the medical staff

01:16:18.990 --> 01:16:20.690
from both sides.

01:16:20.690 --> 01:16:27.550
So starting from 2011, when some
medical staff, they were trying

01:16:27.550 --> 01:16:31.220
to provide help to the
people from the other side,

01:16:31.220 --> 01:16:35.040
they were receiving a lot of
pressure from the regime side.

01:16:35.040 --> 01:16:40.000
And at the same time, medical
staff in the opposition,

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:43.990
they are under enormous pressure
from specific fraction groups

01:16:43.990 --> 01:16:47.900
if they treat people
from other groups.

01:16:47.900 --> 01:16:52.460
So the concept was there since
the beginning of the crisis.

01:16:52.460 --> 01:16:56.960
And maybe recently,
especially in 2016,

01:16:56.960 --> 01:16:59.580
we are seeing this
increased targeting.

01:16:59.580 --> 01:17:05.010
It seems that a lot of targeting
of the civilian infrastructure

01:17:05.010 --> 01:17:11.110
are linked to the military
techniques of all the parties

01:17:11.110 --> 01:17:14.190
involved in this conflict.

01:17:14.190 --> 01:17:17.250
Because it seems whenever
they besieged any area,

01:17:17.250 --> 01:17:20.960
then they will start to target
the civilian infrastructure,

01:17:20.960 --> 01:17:23.630
and mainly hospitals
and medical staff,

01:17:23.630 --> 01:17:27.470
to push people to flee
out of these areas.

01:17:27.470 --> 01:17:31.430
And then they can have
some demographic changes.

01:17:31.430 --> 01:17:35.270
And unfortunately, that's what
happened in several areas,

01:17:35.270 --> 01:17:38.600
in Homs and [INAUDIBLE]
in 2014, and the same

01:17:38.600 --> 01:17:40.150
happened this year.

01:17:40.150 --> 01:17:43.510
Three population movements,
or forced movements,

01:17:43.510 --> 01:17:47.940
happened from Al-Zabadani, from
[? Maldonia, ?] and recently

01:17:47.940 --> 01:17:49.660
from Al-Ward and Homs.

01:17:49.660 --> 01:17:52.160
So they besiege the
area and then target

01:17:52.160 --> 01:17:54.000
the civilian
infrastructure, so people,

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:55.460
they don't have options.

01:17:55.460 --> 01:17:56.990
They should leave.

01:17:56.990 --> 01:17:58.640
And especially the
medical services,

01:17:58.640 --> 01:18:02.360
because it is essential
for the people who

01:18:02.360 --> 01:18:06.640
stayed to have medical help,
because they are under daily

01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:08.170
targeting by air strikes.

01:18:08.170 --> 01:18:11.140
So without having
medical services,

01:18:11.140 --> 01:18:13.750
they are more likely to
flee out of their home.

01:18:13.750 --> 01:18:17.890
So these are the interpretations
that we heard from the people

01:18:17.890 --> 01:18:22.940
in Syria, that it seems
that it is like a target

01:18:22.940 --> 01:18:26.631
specifically within
besieged areas.

01:18:26.631 --> 01:18:29.760
-Noel, did you have any
insights on this aspect

01:18:29.760 --> 01:18:31.760
from a UNHCR perspective?

01:18:31.760 --> 01:18:35.990
Because it's such a fundamental
violation of international law

01:18:35.990 --> 01:18:41.020
that just dispassionately, even
in other very bitter conflicts,

01:18:41.020 --> 01:18:43.400
this kind of targeting
hasn't happened.

01:18:43.400 --> 01:18:45.630
So I just wondered, is
this something that's

01:18:45.630 --> 01:18:51.970
been taken up even with the
UN as experts are meeting,

01:18:51.970 --> 01:18:54.210
or has it gone
beyond that point?

01:18:54.210 --> 01:18:54.710
-Yeah.

01:18:54.710 --> 01:18:57.500
And what we haven't
talked about today

01:18:57.500 --> 01:19:01.440
is that a part of any
comprehensive solutions

01:19:01.440 --> 01:19:04.760
has to be a solution to the war.

01:19:04.760 --> 01:19:07.030
There is not-- the
former High Commissioner

01:19:07.030 --> 01:19:09.340
of Refugees, who's
just been-- we're

01:19:09.340 --> 01:19:11.100
very proud he is now
the new Secretary

01:19:11.100 --> 01:19:14.600
General, Antonio Guterres,
will start his term in January.

01:19:14.600 --> 01:19:18.060
But he kept saying, there
is no humanitarian solution

01:19:18.060 --> 01:19:21.010
to the war in Syria, there
is only a political solution.

01:19:21.010 --> 01:19:24.250
And peace is the only solution.

01:19:24.250 --> 01:19:26.730
And what you can say about
these horrible violations

01:19:26.730 --> 01:19:29.270
of international
humanitarian law

01:19:29.270 --> 01:19:31.930
is that, as Karim
has already said,

01:19:31.930 --> 01:19:35.010
it's a major cause
of displacement.

01:19:35.010 --> 01:19:38.120
It is targeted toward
increasing displacement.

01:19:38.120 --> 01:19:41.770
And we can build better
systems of receiving refugees

01:19:41.770 --> 01:19:44.850
in neighboring countries, we
can increase resettlement,

01:19:44.850 --> 01:19:47.360
but we're not going to
solve the Syrian refugee

01:19:47.360 --> 01:19:49.380
problem in that way.

01:19:49.380 --> 01:19:56.600
We need to find peace in
Syria, as difficult as that is.

01:19:56.600 --> 01:19:57.620
-Thank you.

01:19:57.620 --> 01:20:03.380
Rania, I wanted to ask
you about your really

01:20:03.380 --> 01:20:06.280
compelling and
beautiful pictures.

01:20:06.280 --> 01:20:10.480
You said that you started
photographing the children when

01:20:10.480 --> 01:20:13.090
you realized that they
liked-- they welcomed

01:20:13.090 --> 01:20:17.360
the attention, in a way.

01:20:17.360 --> 01:20:22.250
But there are concerns that
many of us have about the way

01:20:22.250 --> 01:20:24.840
in which children
are always used

01:20:24.840 --> 01:20:30.590
to highlight, and sometimes
to sensationalize, tragedy.

01:20:30.590 --> 01:20:33.920
And of course, the
technical question

01:20:33.920 --> 01:20:36.730
is, how does one get
consent, is there

01:20:36.730 --> 01:20:40.600
a parent who's giving consent,
what happens to the images?

01:20:40.600 --> 01:20:43.680
But the broader
question is, what

01:20:43.680 --> 01:20:46.900
is the role that these images
then play in the world,

01:20:46.900 --> 01:20:48.120
and how are they controlled?

01:20:48.120 --> 01:20:49.940
And I am sure you've
thought about this.

01:20:49.940 --> 01:20:56.540
I'd love to have just your
reflections on the-- I

01:20:56.540 --> 01:20:58.970
guess its tension, the
pluses and the minuses.

01:20:58.970 --> 01:21:02.020
Obviously, there are
compelling and they involve us,

01:21:02.020 --> 01:21:07.680
but at the same time there's
a sense of maybe some sort

01:21:07.680 --> 01:21:09.020
of ethical concerns.

01:21:09.020 --> 01:21:11.430
So I'd just love to hear
your thoughts on that.

01:21:11.430 --> 01:21:15.560
-You know, really, for
me, I photographed them

01:21:15.560 --> 01:21:17.350
like I photograph my own kids.

01:21:17.350 --> 01:21:21.510
And I felt like they were--
it was important for me

01:21:21.510 --> 01:21:22.510
to give them a face.

01:21:22.510 --> 01:21:26.040
So it was done with
a good intention,

01:21:26.040 --> 01:21:28.770
and I didn't think beyond
that, I have to say.

01:21:28.770 --> 01:21:32.330
I'm not using-- CNN asked
me to put them on TV.

01:21:32.330 --> 01:21:34.640
I didn't agree, because
the kids did not want

01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:36.670
to have their pictures on TV.

01:21:36.670 --> 01:21:39.860
So I am trying to use
it for the right reason

01:21:39.860 --> 01:21:42.180
and the right context.

01:21:42.180 --> 01:21:45.760
I have an exhibit-- I mean I'm
not paid to do those images.

01:21:45.760 --> 01:21:47.880
This was doing it
because I want to do it.

01:21:47.880 --> 01:21:49.200
I wasn't hired by anybody.

01:21:49.200 --> 01:21:52.630
So I'm very careful, they're
protected by my copyright.

01:21:52.630 --> 01:21:55.540
I'm very careful
where they end up.

01:21:55.540 --> 01:21:59.030
And I'm only showing them
within the context of my work.

01:21:59.030 --> 01:22:03.185
Now, in the Middle East, in
general, I dumped the consent

01:22:03.185 --> 01:22:04.910
a long time ago.

01:22:04.910 --> 01:22:07.600
Because asking people
for consent makes

01:22:07.600 --> 01:22:10.680
people freak out like they're
signing their life away.

01:22:10.680 --> 01:22:14.440
And I realized it's a
very different culture,

01:22:14.440 --> 01:22:17.690
and once the trust
is established,

01:22:17.690 --> 01:22:20.410
this was more important than
giving them a piece of paper

01:22:20.410 --> 01:22:21.360
and signing it.

01:22:21.360 --> 01:22:24.150
As soon as I gave
them the paper,

01:22:24.150 --> 01:22:28.010
the whole trust in the
relationship was altered.

01:22:28.010 --> 01:22:32.570
So in the camps, I've
never asked for anything.

01:22:32.570 --> 01:22:35.820
I go back, I give them
pictures, I work with the NGOs.

01:22:35.820 --> 01:22:38.130
I don't want to have
an exchange of money,

01:22:38.130 --> 01:22:40.930
because I don't want it to be
about paying for the image.

01:22:40.930 --> 01:22:43.740
So I give some
money to the NGOs,

01:22:43.740 --> 01:22:47.460
and I tell them I want them to
help the few families that I

01:22:47.460 --> 01:22:50.570
build relationships
with over the year.

01:22:50.570 --> 01:22:52.829
Now, this is coming from
the right intentions,

01:22:52.829 --> 01:22:54.620
and I'm trying to be
as protective of where

01:22:54.620 --> 01:22:58.450
the images end up as I can.

01:22:58.450 --> 01:22:58.980
-Thank you.

01:22:58.980 --> 01:23:01.271
I mean it's an interesting
question, because of course,

01:23:01.271 --> 01:23:04.941
as scholars and academics,
we're very circumscribed in what

01:23:04.941 --> 01:23:05.440
we can do.

01:23:05.440 --> 01:23:05.760
We have--

01:23:05.760 --> 01:23:05.960
-Oh, absolutey.

01:23:05.960 --> 01:23:07.085
---to get permission from--

01:23:07.085 --> 01:23:09.390
-And then-- and
the kids, really, I

01:23:09.390 --> 01:23:15.231
felt like most people did not--
one time I was photographing--

01:23:15.231 --> 01:23:16.980
I'm almost embarrassed
to tell this story,

01:23:16.980 --> 01:23:18.938
but you have to put it
in the context of people

01:23:18.938 --> 01:23:19.980
are fed up in Lebanon.

01:23:19.980 --> 01:23:21.664
But I was
photographing that boy,

01:23:21.664 --> 01:23:23.580
and I was kind of in the
middle of the street.

01:23:23.580 --> 01:23:27.340
It was a small alley, and this
guy came speeding toward me.

01:23:27.340 --> 01:23:30.070
So I kind of jumped
backwards, and I

01:23:30.070 --> 01:23:32.181
yelled in Arabic,
what's wrong with you?

01:23:32.181 --> 01:23:33.680
And he said, you
deserve it, why are

01:23:33.680 --> 01:23:35.970
you photographing those dogs?

01:23:35.970 --> 01:23:40.390
So it was-- most people do
not treat them like that.

01:23:40.390 --> 01:23:43.509
But I realized for me, somebody
to treat them with respect

01:23:43.509 --> 01:23:45.300
and pay attention to
them and talk to them,

01:23:45.300 --> 01:23:47.780
and I would go buy
them candy and water,

01:23:47.780 --> 01:23:49.410
it's about building
a relationship.

01:23:49.410 --> 01:23:53.470
They would be happy to see me
when I came back the next day.

01:23:53.470 --> 01:23:54.250
-Thank you.

01:23:54.250 --> 01:23:56.030
The last question
I'm going to ask--

01:23:56.030 --> 01:23:59.400
and maybe people can start
thinking about their questions

01:23:59.400 --> 01:24:03.680
while I do-- is about the
question that several of you

01:24:03.680 --> 01:24:05.350
raised about documents.

01:24:05.350 --> 01:24:08.362
So Abdulkarim, you said that
one of the reasons people leave

01:24:08.362 --> 01:24:10.070
is because they don't
have a relationship

01:24:10.070 --> 01:24:10.940
with the government.

01:24:10.940 --> 01:24:15.730
And Susan, you said that
people are irregular, illegal,

01:24:15.730 --> 01:24:17.110
they don't have a legal status.

01:24:17.110 --> 01:24:21.850
And we know from
work that many of us

01:24:21.850 --> 01:24:25.440
are engaged in that many
of the children lack

01:24:25.440 --> 01:24:26.780
birth registration.

01:24:26.780 --> 01:24:28.690
Now many of the Syrian
children are actually

01:24:28.690 --> 01:24:32.500
becoming stateless, which
has lifelong consequences.

01:24:32.500 --> 01:24:38.370
So why can't the advances that
we've made with new technology

01:24:38.370 --> 01:24:42.140
be used to create
a simple mechanism?

01:24:42.140 --> 01:24:47.810
Not beyond the intelligence of
many, many people in this town

01:24:47.810 --> 01:24:49.450
to create a simple
mechanism of having

01:24:49.450 --> 01:24:51.433
a fingerprint, and a
date, and a photograph.

01:24:53.977 --> 01:24:55.560
Are people trying
to think about this?

01:24:55.560 --> 01:24:58.143
Because it's been talked about
for at least a year and a half,

01:24:58.143 --> 01:25:00.940
this idea of really ensuring
that children are not

01:25:00.940 --> 01:25:04.220
undocumented, that children are
not stateless, that children do

01:25:04.220 --> 01:25:06.390
have some record
of their identity,

01:25:06.390 --> 01:25:09.120
and, ideally, of their birth.

01:25:09.120 --> 01:25:10.790
Do either of you,
maybe in particular,

01:25:10.790 --> 01:25:12.510
know whether any of
this is happening?

01:25:12.510 --> 01:25:14.610
And if not, why not?

01:25:14.610 --> 01:25:16.600
-Should I start just
describing the situation

01:25:16.600 --> 01:25:18.520
in Syria and in Turkey?

01:25:18.520 --> 01:25:20.600
It is not about technology,
actually, at all.

01:25:20.600 --> 01:25:22.970
Because even in Turkey,
they do have the technology,

01:25:22.970 --> 01:25:27.290
but they struggle in the
birth registration example.

01:25:27.290 --> 01:25:29.660
If, for example, I have
a daughter in Turkey,

01:25:29.660 --> 01:25:32.360
I'll struggle a lot to
have a birth certificate.

01:25:32.360 --> 01:25:34.220
And if I don't have
a birth certificate,

01:25:34.220 --> 01:25:37.800
I cannot get the Syrian
nationality, even.

01:25:37.800 --> 01:25:40.550
So even in Turkey,
there is a problem

01:25:40.550 --> 01:25:42.360
related to the
personal documentation

01:25:42.360 --> 01:25:44.040
or personal state.

01:25:44.040 --> 01:25:47.460
In Syria, there were some
ideas and initiatives

01:25:47.460 --> 01:25:48.990
by the local councils.

01:25:48.990 --> 01:25:50.810
And local councils,
they are kind

01:25:50.810 --> 01:25:55.690
of ad hoc structures in each
village and each city in Syria.

01:25:55.690 --> 01:25:57.760
They are from the
local people, kind

01:25:57.760 --> 01:26:01.850
of representing their
people, the village itself,

01:26:01.850 --> 01:26:04.940
and trying to provide
the services there.

01:26:04.940 --> 01:26:06.720
So some of these
local councils, they

01:26:06.720 --> 01:26:10.330
started recording
especially the births

01:26:10.330 --> 01:26:14.480
and deaths, and properties,
and some other information.

01:26:14.480 --> 01:26:17.915
But actually, they
don't have the support.

01:26:17.915 --> 01:26:21.130
There was maybe one project
through the system coordination

01:26:21.130 --> 01:26:23.430
unit supported,
I think, by OFDA,

01:26:23.430 --> 01:26:26.460
maybe at some point,
or other donors,

01:26:26.460 --> 01:26:30.970
to support the local councils to
do kind of governance structure

01:26:30.970 --> 01:26:31.530
to them.

01:26:31.530 --> 01:26:35.326
But I think they didn't receive
proper support to do that.

01:26:37.911 --> 01:26:38.410
-OK.

01:26:38.410 --> 01:26:40.660
Well, thank you very
much, all of you.

01:26:40.660 --> 01:26:44.300
So if anybody would
like to ask a question,

01:26:44.300 --> 01:26:46.430
please line up behind
the microphone.

01:26:46.430 --> 01:26:51.560
And as Dean Cohen said,
just give us your name

01:26:51.560 --> 01:26:55.100
and ask your question.

01:26:55.100 --> 01:26:55.986
-Thank you very much.

01:26:55.986 --> 01:26:58.970
I'm Hala Zreiqat, one of
the Radcliffe Fellows.

01:26:58.970 --> 01:27:02.620
I am Jordanian by origin,
but live in Australia.

01:27:02.620 --> 01:27:04.660
The question I would
like to ask is,

01:27:04.660 --> 01:27:09.790
what's the panel view on the
position of the Gulf region,

01:27:09.790 --> 01:27:13.560
in terms of opening their
doors to the refugees in Syria

01:27:13.560 --> 01:27:14.780
or Palestine?

01:27:14.780 --> 01:27:16.620
The reason I ask
about that is I,

01:27:16.620 --> 01:27:20.500
myself, quite often ask
this question-- why should

01:27:20.500 --> 01:27:23.390
Europe, America-- not
Australia at the moment,

01:27:23.390 --> 01:27:25.210
they're closing their
borders, I think--

01:27:25.210 --> 01:27:28.780
but why should we open
the doors for refugees

01:27:28.780 --> 01:27:33.820
when you have the money and
the space in the Gulf region?

01:27:33.820 --> 01:27:34.730
-Thank you very much.

01:27:34.730 --> 01:27:35.490
Yeah.

01:27:35.490 --> 01:27:38.240
Let's take one more
question, and then we'll

01:27:38.240 --> 01:27:39.380
ask the panel to respond.

01:27:39.380 --> 01:27:40.071
Yes?

01:27:40.071 --> 01:27:42.070
-It's an interesting match
to the last question.

01:27:42.070 --> 01:27:43.690
My name is Cheryl
Hamilton, I'm the Director

01:27:43.690 --> 01:27:46.020
of Partner Engagement at
the International Institute.

01:27:46.020 --> 01:27:49.590
We resettle 640 refugees
here in the region.

01:27:49.590 --> 01:27:52.360
And I have one request, which
is we just found out, of course,

01:27:52.360 --> 01:27:54.440
we're going to resettle
25,000 more refugees,

01:27:54.440 --> 01:27:58.600
but there was no financial
increase provided.

01:27:58.600 --> 01:28:01.480
So actually, we have less money
to do the same and almost twice

01:28:01.480 --> 01:28:02.370
as much work.

01:28:02.370 --> 01:28:04.690
But my interesting
question is, I really

01:28:04.690 --> 01:28:06.210
admired how you
said that we don't

01:28:06.210 --> 01:28:08.840
talk enough about all
refugee populations.

01:28:08.840 --> 01:28:12.040
We're resettling right now
only six Syrian families,

01:28:12.040 --> 01:28:15.100
but we have 55% of our
cases that are Congolese.

01:28:15.100 --> 01:28:17.590
How do we advocate well
on behalf of all refugee

01:28:17.590 --> 01:28:20.760
populations, not ignoring
this amazing work you're

01:28:20.760 --> 01:28:22.500
doing today?

01:28:22.500 --> 01:28:23.450
-Thank you so much.

01:28:23.450 --> 01:28:26.377
So Noel, would you like to
take one of those questions?

01:28:29.630 --> 01:28:31.660
-Yeah, I would just
underline really

01:28:31.660 --> 01:28:33.800
the importance of the
point that you've just

01:28:33.800 --> 01:28:36.400
made, about advocating well
on behalf of all refugee

01:28:36.400 --> 01:28:37.870
populations.

01:28:37.870 --> 01:28:44.340
You do perceive, especially at
the UN, a kind of a jealous,

01:28:44.340 --> 01:28:47.700
my refugee situation is getting
more attention than yours.

01:28:47.700 --> 01:28:51.460
And that's not
just a petty issue,

01:28:51.460 --> 01:28:53.850
because it's an
issue about funding.

01:28:53.850 --> 01:28:56.360
We have very, very
critical underfunding

01:28:56.360 --> 01:28:59.520
of many, many
refugee situations.

01:28:59.520 --> 01:29:05.160
And it's now about the sense
that if you sort of put

01:29:05.160 --> 01:29:07.740
your refugees under
pressure, that's a good way

01:29:07.740 --> 01:29:10.450
to get more financial support.

01:29:10.450 --> 01:29:13.200
And we don't want to go
down that road, where

01:29:13.200 --> 01:29:16.750
in order for a country to get
more support for its refugees,

01:29:16.750 --> 01:29:20.460
it needs to threaten to send
them back to their own country,

01:29:20.460 --> 01:29:22.740
for example.

01:29:22.740 --> 01:29:27.110
Refugees, there needs to be
some principle of equity.

01:29:27.110 --> 01:29:30.520
And so as much as
we need to talk

01:29:30.520 --> 01:29:34.800
about the situation in Syria, I
think in all of these contexts,

01:29:34.800 --> 01:29:37.890
we need to keep also bring up
situations like what's going on

01:29:37.890 --> 01:29:43.020
in Congo, or South
Sudan, or not to forget

01:29:43.020 --> 01:29:44.700
about Afghanistan and Somalia.

01:29:44.700 --> 01:29:48.760
Those poor people have been
refugees for 20, 30 years.

01:29:48.760 --> 01:29:51.420
And then the
Palestinians, as well.

01:29:51.420 --> 01:29:56.240
So it is very important to keep
all of these issues together,

01:29:56.240 --> 01:30:00.450
because that helps to improve
the protection for all.

01:30:00.450 --> 01:30:00.950
-Thank you.

01:30:00.950 --> 01:30:03.325
Susan, do you want to tackle
the question about the Gulf?

01:30:03.325 --> 01:30:04.350
-Yes.

01:30:04.350 --> 01:30:09.530
And actually, the
Gulf states, the UAE

01:30:09.530 --> 01:30:11.740
has agreed to take
a few thousand.

01:30:11.740 --> 01:30:16.590
I think it's no more than 45
or something thousand Syrians.

01:30:16.590 --> 01:30:19.949
And I don't know the details
of what the actual status is

01:30:19.949 --> 01:30:22.240
that they're planning to
give, because they're also not

01:30:22.240 --> 01:30:24.660
parties to the
Refugee Convention.

01:30:24.660 --> 01:30:27.810
So it would have to be by
memorandum of agreement

01:30:27.810 --> 01:30:31.780
with the UNHCR what the
parameters of that agreement

01:30:31.780 --> 01:30:32.280
would be.

01:30:32.280 --> 01:30:34.600
But I think you make a
really good point, which

01:30:34.600 --> 01:30:36.460
is that in most of
the discussions,

01:30:36.460 --> 01:30:39.060
the Gulf has been left off.

01:30:39.060 --> 01:30:41.780
And I think because of the
sense that the Gulf has never

01:30:41.780 --> 01:30:48.050
been welcoming to refugees, and
has a huge problem of migrants,

01:30:48.050 --> 01:30:51.250
migrant workers, who
have been struggling

01:30:51.250 --> 01:30:57.060
to get some kind of status and
basic rights for themselves

01:30:57.060 --> 01:30:58.880
as workers.

01:30:58.880 --> 01:31:02.080
So that's an ongoing
struggle with the Gulf.

01:31:02.080 --> 01:31:04.570
But I think it's a
really good point,

01:31:04.570 --> 01:31:06.910
and there needs to be
much more attention paid.

01:31:06.910 --> 01:31:09.630
Now, the Gulf states are
paying a lot of money

01:31:09.630 --> 01:31:13.870
to Turkey in particular, but
also to Jordan, for the camps

01:31:13.870 --> 01:31:16.540
and for the refugees there.

01:31:16.540 --> 01:31:18.200
But of course, that's
not a substitute

01:31:18.200 --> 01:31:21.200
for actually accepting them.

01:31:21.200 --> 01:31:24.900
-I think also, sadly,
religion plays a big role

01:31:24.900 --> 01:31:28.070
in the Middle East right now.

01:31:28.070 --> 01:31:31.750
Palestinian Christians
were given citizenship,

01:31:31.750 --> 01:31:34.550
Palestinian Muslims ended
up in the refugee camps.

01:31:34.550 --> 01:31:37.970
And I think now the whole--
a lot of Lebanese Shia

01:31:37.970 --> 01:31:41.920
are not given visas anymore to
go work in the Gulf countries,

01:31:41.920 --> 01:31:45.960
like Dubai and the
UAE and Saudi Arabia.

01:31:45.960 --> 01:31:48.570
And so there's a
whole other layer

01:31:48.570 --> 01:31:54.120
of dirty politics and religion
that's playing in that as well.

01:31:54.120 --> 01:31:54.740
-Thank you.

01:31:54.740 --> 01:31:56.350
Yes, next question, please.

01:31:56.350 --> 01:31:58.120
-Hi, my name is Ana.

01:31:58.120 --> 01:31:59.320
I was just wondering.

01:31:59.320 --> 01:32:01.600
So at the beginning
of this whole panel,

01:32:01.600 --> 01:32:04.930
it was mentioned that a
refugee crisis couldn't really

01:32:04.930 --> 01:32:08.920
become possible until the
creation of the nation state.

01:32:08.920 --> 01:32:11.460
And so I was just wondering,
and this isn't directed

01:32:11.460 --> 01:32:14.130
towards anyone in
particular, but does

01:32:14.130 --> 01:32:17.640
today's international
refugee crisis speak

01:32:17.640 --> 01:32:20.420
to the constructedness
of the nation state

01:32:20.420 --> 01:32:24.460
and that borders are
so porous, or does

01:32:24.460 --> 01:32:29.180
a state's lack of
response or desire

01:32:29.180 --> 01:32:34.665
to protect the nation state
speak to its solidity?

01:32:37.560 --> 01:32:38.220
-Thank you.

01:32:38.220 --> 01:32:40.850
Yeah, and we'll have
one more question.

01:32:40.850 --> 01:32:44.820
-I'm Abigail English and I'm
a former Radcliffe Fellow.

01:32:44.820 --> 01:32:46.780
In your opening
remarks, Jackie, you

01:32:46.780 --> 01:32:50.400
mentioned that many
of the refugees

01:32:50.400 --> 01:32:54.900
are not part of families,
are traveling on their own.

01:32:54.900 --> 01:33:00.080
And so many of them are
children or adolescents.

01:33:00.080 --> 01:33:02.590
And I'm wondering
whether any of you

01:33:02.590 --> 01:33:05.430
could comment from
a humanitarian,

01:33:05.430 --> 01:33:08.250
or a human rights, or
a legal perspective,

01:33:08.250 --> 01:33:12.170
what the potential
opportunities are

01:33:12.170 --> 01:33:15.490
for protecting those
young people who

01:33:15.490 --> 01:33:17.630
are traveling on their own.

01:33:17.630 --> 01:33:18.130
Thank you.

01:33:18.130 --> 01:33:20.200
-Thank you very much, Abigail.

01:33:20.200 --> 01:33:22.440
OK, so the first
question was really,

01:33:22.440 --> 01:33:25.640
what does this
refugee crisis say

01:33:25.640 --> 01:33:28.780
about the viability or the
continuing of the nation

01:33:28.780 --> 01:33:31.100
state and the notion
that every state has

01:33:31.100 --> 01:33:33.760
its own sovereign right
to protect its borders,

01:33:33.760 --> 01:33:38.160
given how, in a way, borders
have become more porous?

01:33:38.160 --> 01:33:41.300
So is this signaling
some sort of change,

01:33:41.300 --> 01:33:45.300
or is this signaling
just a retrenchment,

01:33:45.300 --> 01:33:48.470
in terms of a humanitarian
commitment, I suppose?

01:33:48.470 --> 01:33:51.959
So would anybody like
to tackle that question?

01:33:51.959 --> 01:33:52.750
OK, Noel, go ahead.

01:33:52.750 --> 01:33:54.170
-Maybe I'll tackle that.

01:33:54.170 --> 01:33:57.870
If there is change, it's as the
Arabs would say, shway shway.

01:33:57.870 --> 01:33:59.350
It's very slow.

01:33:59.350 --> 01:34:02.450
Because look, in the
negotiations in New York,

01:34:02.450 --> 01:34:05.230
it's very clear that
states want to maintain

01:34:05.230 --> 01:34:06.470
control of their borders.

01:34:06.470 --> 01:34:08.340
And this is the
political environment

01:34:08.340 --> 01:34:12.330
in which we're living in, where
there's more and more talk

01:34:12.330 --> 01:34:17.240
about border control, and this
association of people coming

01:34:17.240 --> 01:34:19.340
in with all sorts of the ills.

01:34:19.340 --> 01:34:23.380
But at the same time, we
did have the moment-- which,

01:34:23.380 --> 01:34:25.320
it's very small--
but an agreement

01:34:25.320 --> 01:34:27.780
that now we're going
to discuss migration

01:34:27.780 --> 01:34:28.740
at the United Nations.

01:34:28.740 --> 01:34:32.237
Before, that topic was
actually taboo at the UN.

01:34:32.237 --> 01:34:34.570
That we're going to bring the
International Organization

01:34:34.570 --> 01:34:37.040
for Migration into
the United Nations--

01:34:37.040 --> 01:34:38.330
before it was a separate.

01:34:38.330 --> 01:34:40.930
The UN didn't have a
migration organization.

01:34:40.930 --> 01:34:42.310
So that's a step.

01:34:42.310 --> 01:34:46.370
And that we're going to have
an international conference

01:34:46.370 --> 01:34:47.410
on migration.

01:34:47.410 --> 01:34:50.590
The idea to have an
intergovernmental process

01:34:50.590 --> 01:34:53.970
on migration, that goes
back at least to 1994,

01:34:53.970 --> 01:34:55.720
and member states would
never agree to it.

01:34:55.720 --> 01:34:57.700
So the fact that
they agreed to it

01:34:57.700 --> 01:35:02.505
now suggests some recognition
that migration isn't something

01:35:02.505 --> 01:35:05.060
that states manage
on their own, it's

01:35:05.060 --> 01:35:07.500
something that
needs to be governed

01:35:07.500 --> 01:35:09.180
within the international system.

01:35:09.180 --> 01:35:12.280
So maybe a little bit
of a shift, but not

01:35:12.280 --> 01:35:15.850
a big philosophical
transformation at this point.

01:35:15.850 --> 01:35:16.425
-Thank you.

01:35:16.425 --> 01:35:18.010
Yeah.

01:35:18.010 --> 01:35:22.560
And the question about children,
particularly unaccompanied

01:35:22.560 --> 01:35:25.530
children, and what
protections are available

01:35:25.530 --> 01:35:28.300
and what protections
are being provided,

01:35:28.300 --> 01:35:30.140
does anybody want
to address that?

01:35:30.140 --> 01:35:32.040
-I can address what
I saw in Lebanon.

01:35:32.040 --> 01:35:33.750
The kids were very vulnerable.

01:35:33.750 --> 01:35:36.010
I don't think there was--
as far as I could tell.

01:35:36.010 --> 01:35:37.740
But again, it's
something from my--

01:35:37.740 --> 01:35:41.050
there was no
protection whatsoever.

01:35:41.050 --> 01:35:42.790
I was told they
come in a big truck,

01:35:42.790 --> 01:35:44.706
and they get dropped off
early in the morning,

01:35:44.706 --> 01:35:48.545
and they're expected to
just bring money back.

01:35:48.545 --> 01:35:51.256
A five-year-old would give me
a name, and would come back

01:35:51.256 --> 01:35:52.880
and I heard her
talking to another guy,

01:35:52.880 --> 01:35:54.570
and she had told me
her name was Samira,

01:35:54.570 --> 01:35:57.070
and now she's talking to the
guy, and he said, OK, bye, Aya.

01:35:57.070 --> 01:35:59.300
And I told her, oh, you told
me your name was Samira.

01:35:59.300 --> 01:36:01.550
And she whispers,
I'm lying to him.

01:36:01.550 --> 01:36:03.530
And obviously she's
lying to me, but I

01:36:03.530 --> 01:36:06.230
realized they learn to
be very street smart.

01:36:06.230 --> 01:36:09.320
And she was five.

01:36:09.320 --> 01:36:12.220
So they felt extremely
vulnerable to me.

01:36:12.220 --> 01:36:15.170
The girls were very beautiful
and very vulnerable,

01:36:15.170 --> 01:36:18.230
and the boys I felt
were as vulnerable.

01:36:18.230 --> 01:36:20.920
This is the next generation,
and these kids are not

01:36:20.920 --> 01:36:24.120
being educated, and
I worry about them

01:36:24.120 --> 01:36:26.540
on the streets for too
long, ended up being

01:36:26.540 --> 01:36:29.020
recruited in the wrong places.

01:36:29.020 --> 01:36:30.570
They are easy targets.

01:36:30.570 --> 01:36:34.390
-Just quickly address
that from two aspects.

01:36:34.390 --> 01:36:38.460
One is the what legal
protections are available,

01:36:38.460 --> 01:36:40.580
and the second is
that it's actually

01:36:40.580 --> 01:36:42.830
becoming an enormous crisis.

01:36:42.830 --> 01:36:46.700
We've started a project on
the pushbacks from Greece

01:36:46.700 --> 01:36:50.350
and Bulgaria this
year with my students,

01:36:50.350 --> 01:36:53.000
and my Greek
colleagues have been

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:56.680
documenting that there
are thousands of migrants

01:36:56.680 --> 01:36:58.320
who are disappearing.

01:36:58.320 --> 01:37:02.430
After arriving on
these terrible voyages,

01:37:02.430 --> 01:37:04.692
they are somehow disappearing.

01:37:04.692 --> 01:37:06.940
The NGOs are reaching
some of them,

01:37:06.940 --> 01:37:09.450
and then they can't find them.

01:37:09.450 --> 01:37:11.980
So that's an enormous issue.

01:37:11.980 --> 01:37:14.450
And Greece has been
dealing with detentions,

01:37:14.450 --> 01:37:16.040
and they've been
detaining minors.

01:37:16.040 --> 01:37:19.860
Bulgaria also is
detaining minors.

01:37:19.860 --> 01:37:23.060
So the problem of
tracking these kids,

01:37:23.060 --> 01:37:26.050
and having a mechanism
of registration,

01:37:26.050 --> 01:37:28.700
and serious protection to
provide for their needs

01:37:28.700 --> 01:37:34.530
immediately when they arrive,
is a very, very big challenge.

01:37:34.530 --> 01:37:37.260
Having said that,
there's plenty of law

01:37:37.260 --> 01:37:42.540
on special protections across
the EU under European law.

01:37:42.540 --> 01:37:44.920
The Human Rights
Convention, the Convention

01:37:44.920 --> 01:37:47.490
on the Rights of
a Child do provide

01:37:47.490 --> 01:37:49.800
for very specific
obligations on states

01:37:49.800 --> 01:37:52.070
to protect minors and
unaccompanied minors.

01:37:52.070 --> 01:37:55.560
In the US, we have both
trafficking protections

01:37:55.560 --> 01:37:58.860
under our immigration law
that apply to children

01:37:58.860 --> 01:38:01.590
and also something called
Special Immigrant Juvenile

01:38:01.590 --> 01:38:08.700
Status, which allows children
to get immigration status

01:38:08.700 --> 01:38:13.370
once the fact that they
don't have a parent taking

01:38:13.370 --> 01:38:18.120
care of them is documented
and registered by the courts.

01:38:18.120 --> 01:38:20.790
So it's not a problem
of lack of law,

01:38:20.790 --> 01:38:23.918
but again that it's
not being carried out.

01:38:27.030 --> 01:38:28.022
-Thank you.

01:38:28.022 --> 01:38:31.004
Yes, next question.

01:38:31.004 --> 01:38:31.920
-If so many refugees--

01:38:31.920 --> 01:38:33.670
-Could you just give
us your name, please?

01:38:33.670 --> 01:38:37.940
-Oh, my name is [? Mishiti. ?]
If so many refugees

01:38:37.940 --> 01:38:40.640
are fleeing their
countries, what's happening

01:38:40.640 --> 01:38:44.000
to the country's economy?

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.500
It seems that the countries
are entering a poverty

01:38:46.500 --> 01:38:50.900
cycle, in which poor economies
cause people to seek refuge

01:38:50.900 --> 01:38:54.270
in other countries, which in
turn makes the economy worse.

01:38:54.270 --> 01:38:56.620
What is the solution to this?

01:38:56.620 --> 01:38:57.641
-Thank you so much.

01:38:57.641 --> 01:38:58.140
[LAUGHTER]

01:38:58.140 --> 01:38:59.840
Nice, simple question.

01:38:59.840 --> 01:39:00.520
Thank you.

01:39:00.520 --> 01:39:02.090
And we'll have
one more question.

01:39:02.090 --> 01:39:03.221
Thank you.

01:39:03.221 --> 01:39:03.720
-Thank you.

01:39:03.720 --> 01:39:09.570
My name is [? Gilda. ?]
May 2015 to September 2015,

01:39:09.570 --> 01:39:11.440
I must have kept
every paper clipping

01:39:11.440 --> 01:39:14.160
from Financial
Times that focused

01:39:14.160 --> 01:39:18.890
on the pictures of the refugee
crisis, the migration crisis.

01:39:18.890 --> 01:39:23.220
2015 September, I stopped,
because all I could do

01:39:23.220 --> 01:39:27.350
was cry over those
paper clippings.

01:39:27.350 --> 01:39:32.290
Picking up from what perspective
that Susan mentioned,

01:39:32.290 --> 01:39:36.185
within the confines of the
bureaucracy of the laws

01:39:36.185 --> 01:39:44.370
and the rules that limit us from
giving any humanitarian help,

01:39:44.370 --> 01:39:47.700
as a mother, as a
woman, as a common man,

01:39:47.700 --> 01:39:51.190
what powers do I
have to participate

01:39:51.190 --> 01:39:52.950
in this humanitarian crisis?

01:39:52.950 --> 01:39:57.920
How can it be more easy for me
to help without bureaucracy?

01:39:57.920 --> 01:39:58.420
Thank you.

01:39:58.420 --> 01:40:01.620
-Thank you so much for that
really important question.

01:40:01.620 --> 01:40:07.020
So first of all, the question
about this escalating

01:40:07.020 --> 01:40:10.230
cycle of poverty is the fact
that refugees are leaving,

01:40:10.230 --> 01:40:14.970
leading to population
depletion and greater poverty,

01:40:14.970 --> 01:40:17.430
and a vicious circle.

01:40:17.430 --> 01:40:22.010
Anybody want to address that
and comment on that point?

01:40:22.010 --> 01:40:23.760
Yeah, Abdulkarim.

01:40:23.760 --> 01:40:27.190
-Actually, that's the root
of the crisis in Syria,

01:40:27.190 --> 01:40:31.650
and as I mentioned,
Syria now is losing

01:40:31.650 --> 01:40:36.470
their people who are supposed
to build the country again.

01:40:36.470 --> 01:40:40.290
And the problem is that the
links between these people when

01:40:40.290 --> 01:40:42.370
fleeing out of the
country and Syria

01:40:42.370 --> 01:40:45.310
are really becoming
less and less.

01:40:45.310 --> 01:40:47.760
And for the new
generations, maybe they

01:40:47.760 --> 01:40:50.480
are not linked anymore
with the country.

01:40:50.480 --> 01:40:53.670
In the neighboring
countries-- just in Turkey,

01:40:53.670 --> 01:40:59.340
they recorded approximately
200,000 or 300,000 new births

01:40:59.340 --> 01:41:02.610
for Syrians through
the last five or six

01:41:02.610 --> 01:41:04.150
years who have
never been in Syria,

01:41:04.150 --> 01:41:06.930
and maybe they are linked
to Turkey more than Syria.

01:41:06.930 --> 01:41:08.460
So it is really a serious issue.

01:41:08.460 --> 01:41:12.160
So I think when
studying the polices

01:41:12.160 --> 01:41:14.680
for maybe the UN agencies
and for the international

01:41:14.680 --> 01:41:17.840
organizations, when they are
designing their intervention,

01:41:17.840 --> 01:41:20.394
I think we should make a
link between the refugees,

01:41:20.394 --> 01:41:22.060
especially in the
neighboring countries,

01:41:22.060 --> 01:41:24.980
and anywhere in the world,
and their home country.

01:41:24.980 --> 01:41:27.660
At least if there
is any stability

01:41:27.660 --> 01:41:29.050
in the future,
these people, they

01:41:29.050 --> 01:41:32.270
can come back to participate
in raising the economy

01:41:32.270 --> 01:41:34.250
of their country again.

01:41:34.250 --> 01:41:38.350
-Yeah, as Noel said in
the beginning, of course,

01:41:38.350 --> 01:41:41.130
most refugees-- nearly all
refugees-- want to go home,

01:41:41.130 --> 01:41:44.580
but where you have
acute conflict,

01:41:44.580 --> 01:41:46.750
it's just impossible
to even imagine that.

01:41:46.750 --> 01:41:48.970
And so this task
of rebuilding then

01:41:48.970 --> 01:41:50.730
becomes really
elusive, so I think

01:41:50.730 --> 01:41:53.180
it's a very important point.

01:41:53.180 --> 01:41:55.590
Anybody want to address
the point about the--

01:41:55.590 --> 01:41:56.548
-I want to add to that.

01:41:56.548 --> 01:41:58.460
---civil society and
what individuals can do.

01:41:58.460 --> 01:41:58.960
Yeah?

01:41:58.960 --> 01:42:01.251
-I mean I want to add to him,
as well, because I see it

01:42:01.251 --> 01:42:01.960
from Lebanon.

01:42:01.960 --> 01:42:04.690
I mean Lebanon barely
survived the civil war,

01:42:04.690 --> 01:42:06.280
and it's been a brain drain.

01:42:06.280 --> 01:42:08.820
A little people who could
afford it left the country,

01:42:08.820 --> 01:42:11.490
and now you have half a
million Palestinian refugees,

01:42:11.490 --> 01:42:13.810
about over a million,
maybe a million and a half

01:42:13.810 --> 01:42:15.119
Syrian refugees.

01:42:15.119 --> 01:42:16.660
The garbage is not
getting picked up,

01:42:16.660 --> 01:42:18.640
there's no electricity,
and no water,

01:42:18.640 --> 01:42:20.680
so the problem becomes worse.

01:42:20.680 --> 01:42:24.755
So I don't know how--
it's bigger than Lebanon.

01:42:24.755 --> 01:42:26.880
So it's something where
the international community

01:42:26.880 --> 01:42:28.330
needs to be involved.

01:42:28.330 --> 01:42:30.430
And I found, as of
civil societies,

01:42:30.430 --> 01:42:34.110
there are a lot of local
NGOs who do incredible work.

01:42:34.110 --> 01:42:37.760
And I give them so much credit
than all the politicians,

01:42:37.760 --> 01:42:42.210
because they volunteer,
people donate clothes,

01:42:42.210 --> 01:42:45.360
and they do makeshift
schools for them.

01:42:45.360 --> 01:42:48.270
I think people in the US
are nervous donating money

01:42:48.270 --> 01:42:50.840
to institutions in
the Middle East, which

01:42:50.840 --> 01:42:54.710
is why I recommend looking
up the Karam Foundation.

01:42:54.710 --> 01:42:57.150
The woman is from Aleppo.

01:42:57.150 --> 01:42:58.859
Do you know her, Lena--

01:42:58.859 --> 01:42:59.900
-I heard about her, yeah.

01:42:59.900 --> 01:43:01.788
I know of the work that they do.

01:43:01.788 --> 01:43:04.160
-Yeah, so they do a
lot of work in Turkey.

01:43:04.160 --> 01:43:06.130
And then, for me, when
I was raising money,

01:43:06.130 --> 01:43:08.670
I wanted it to go to
Lebanon, so they kind of

01:43:08.670 --> 01:43:10.960
were telling me where
the money was going,

01:43:10.960 --> 01:43:15.890
and they found the
local NGOs in Lebanon

01:43:15.890 --> 01:43:18.440
who help the Karam Foundation
who could work with them.

01:43:18.440 --> 01:43:21.880
So it's a very transparent way
of donating money if you're

01:43:21.880 --> 01:43:23.090
in the US, to look at them.

01:43:23.090 --> 01:43:25.790
I think they do fantastic work.

01:43:25.790 --> 01:43:27.550
So that's one
recommendation I have.

01:43:27.550 --> 01:43:29.420
They probably have more.

01:43:29.420 --> 01:43:30.669
-OK, we nearly out of time.

01:43:30.669 --> 01:43:31.460
We are out of time.

01:43:31.460 --> 01:43:33.190
So I'll quickly take
the last two questions,

01:43:33.190 --> 01:43:33.930
and then wrap up.

01:43:33.930 --> 01:43:34.710
Yes, sir?

01:43:34.710 --> 01:43:36.770
-Do you mind if I just
answer how you can help,

01:43:36.770 --> 01:43:37.450
because I think that's a--

01:43:37.450 --> 01:43:37.890
-No, sure.

01:43:37.890 --> 01:43:38.390
Absolutely.

01:43:38.390 --> 01:43:40.820
---really, really important one.

01:43:40.820 --> 01:43:44.900
We spent two years, my
student teams and I,

01:43:44.900 --> 01:43:48.840
mapping what was happening
in Turkey and Jordan

01:43:48.840 --> 01:43:51.630
and Lebanon and Egypt
to all of the refugees,

01:43:51.630 --> 01:43:54.620
not just the Syrians, though
we were focused on the Syrians.

01:43:54.620 --> 01:43:56.780
And we produced a
very large report

01:43:56.780 --> 01:44:00.720
that actually lays
out a way forward,

01:44:00.720 --> 01:44:03.060
built on concrete
state obligations,

01:44:03.060 --> 01:44:05.390
including here in
the United States.

01:44:05.390 --> 01:44:07.400
And when we first
started advocating around

01:44:07.400 --> 01:44:09.950
that report in
Washington, we basically

01:44:09.950 --> 01:44:14.140
got the answer that nobody
gives a blank blank about Syria.

01:44:14.140 --> 01:44:15.980
I think that's changed.

01:44:15.980 --> 01:44:19.200
And I think one of the most
powerful delegations that

01:44:19.200 --> 01:44:22.530
is sympathetic to refugees is
right here in Massachusetts.

01:44:22.530 --> 01:44:25.280
Our congressional
representatives

01:44:25.280 --> 01:44:27.310
include people
like Jim McGovern,

01:44:27.310 --> 01:44:29.295
who are absolutely phenomenal.

01:44:29.295 --> 01:44:32.340
He's worked on refugee issues
way back from the Central

01:44:32.340 --> 01:44:36.790
American crises in
the '80s onwards,

01:44:36.790 --> 01:44:39.110
and Capuano, Elizabeth Warren.

01:44:39.110 --> 01:44:44.040
These are people who,
if you take an ask,

01:44:44.040 --> 01:44:47.140
and join the refugee
organizations around Boston

01:44:47.140 --> 01:44:50.640
who are asking not only
for increased resettlement,

01:44:50.640 --> 01:44:53.260
but for temporary
protection statuses

01:44:53.260 --> 01:44:56.940
for new kinds of status similar
to the ones that Canada has.

01:44:56.940 --> 01:44:58.030
Private sponsorship.

01:44:58.030 --> 01:45:00.400
That would be
absolutely incredible

01:45:00.400 --> 01:45:02.500
if we could get something
like private sponsorship

01:45:02.500 --> 01:45:06.050
here, and allow the Arab and
Syrian communities to sponsor

01:45:06.050 --> 01:45:11.470
people from Syria, and the
same for Somalis and others.

01:45:11.470 --> 01:45:13.300
It would be a small step.

01:45:13.300 --> 01:45:15.400
A huge step in the
right direction,

01:45:15.400 --> 01:45:18.510
but a very small and
modest thing to do.

01:45:18.510 --> 01:45:20.700
In addition, there are
lots of organizations

01:45:20.700 --> 01:45:23.100
here in Boston working on
the Syrian refugee crisis.

01:45:23.100 --> 01:45:25.490
There's an organization
called New Day Syria which

01:45:25.490 --> 01:45:28.610
is trying to help the
refugees once they're here,

01:45:28.610 --> 01:45:32.120
finding housing, plugging
them into social services.

01:45:32.120 --> 01:45:35.235
We have an amazing network
of refugee organizations

01:45:35.235 --> 01:45:36.110
right here in Boston.

01:45:36.110 --> 01:45:37.850
You can plug into any of them.

01:45:37.850 --> 01:45:41.240
And look at our report, please.

01:45:41.240 --> 01:45:42.500
-Thank you so much, Susan.

01:45:42.500 --> 01:45:44.331
Yes, OK.

01:45:44.331 --> 01:45:44.830
-Hi, there.

01:45:44.830 --> 01:45:48.550
My name is Jeff Laurenti, with
the somewhat aging reunion

01:45:48.550 --> 01:45:50.690
class of 1971.

01:45:50.690 --> 01:45:53.530
I was struck by
Rania's observation

01:45:53.530 --> 01:45:57.050
that there are often
political agendas that

01:45:57.050 --> 01:46:01.120
work their way through the
publicity given to one refugee

01:46:01.120 --> 01:46:06.070
crisis rather than another, and
Noel's caution against having

01:46:06.070 --> 01:46:09.760
refugee situations in
competition, perhaps

01:46:09.760 --> 01:46:12.610
in part driven by those
political agendas.

01:46:12.610 --> 01:46:16.780
You mentioned Afghanistan, and I
recall that three decades ago--

01:46:16.780 --> 01:46:19.410
people of our reunion
class might remember--

01:46:19.410 --> 01:46:21.900
there was an enormous
amount of press attention

01:46:21.900 --> 01:46:24.570
to Afghan refugees
when it was against

01:46:24.570 --> 01:46:26.340
the Soviet intervention.

01:46:26.340 --> 01:46:29.790
And for the past
18 years, 17 years,

01:46:29.790 --> 01:46:31.870
since the American
intervention, no press

01:46:31.870 --> 01:46:35.670
stories at all about the
Afghan refugees in Pakistan.

01:46:35.670 --> 01:46:39.220
A lot of press attention to
Syrian refugees by people

01:46:39.220 --> 01:46:42.420
who feel revulsion against
the brutality of the Assad

01:46:42.420 --> 01:46:45.460
government, maybe
seeking or hoping

01:46:45.460 --> 01:46:49.680
for a more robust Western
intervention, but on the Congo,

01:46:49.680 --> 01:46:52.230
on South Sudan, on
all these refugee

01:46:52.230 --> 01:46:54.390
situations in Africa, none.

01:46:54.390 --> 01:46:56.880
When these refugees
make their way

01:46:56.880 --> 01:46:59.860
across the Mediterranean
from Libya into Italy,

01:46:59.860 --> 01:47:05.600
there's a blurring, an elision
of whether they are migrants

01:47:05.600 --> 01:47:07.720
or refugees, and
whether they could all

01:47:07.720 --> 01:47:09.210
have the door closed to them.

01:47:09.210 --> 01:47:14.080
So since your summit dealt
with refugees and migrants,

01:47:14.080 --> 01:47:18.490
to what extent are we
seeing an elision of the two

01:47:18.490 --> 01:47:21.340
in the international
debate, to what extent

01:47:21.340 --> 01:47:24.370
do we need international
law to maintain

01:47:24.370 --> 01:47:29.470
very clear distinctions,
and how do we then

01:47:29.470 --> 01:47:33.276
hope to have those distinctions
actually implemented?

01:47:33.276 --> 01:47:34.150
-Thank you very much.

01:47:34.150 --> 01:47:36.740
Yes, and the last question.

01:47:36.740 --> 01:47:38.640
-I don't have a
question, but I would

01:47:38.640 --> 01:47:40.620
like to add something, please.

01:47:40.620 --> 01:47:44.604
One of the biggest countries
that help Syrian refugees

01:47:44.604 --> 01:47:46.500
is Saudi Arabia.

01:47:46.500 --> 01:47:50.784
And given that Saudi Arabia
has welcomed Saudi refugees,

01:47:50.784 --> 01:47:56.090
and has hosted millions
and millions and millions

01:47:56.090 --> 01:48:00.370
of Syrian refugees, and the
Saudi the government gave

01:48:00.370 --> 01:48:03.040
them visas to stay
inside Saudi Arabia,

01:48:03.040 --> 01:48:11.390
and gave them opportunities to
treatment in Saudi hospitals,

01:48:11.390 --> 01:48:15.060
and study in schools, and--

01:48:15.060 --> 01:48:15.560
-Thank you.

01:48:15.560 --> 01:48:19.125
---universities,
and give them work.

01:48:19.125 --> 01:48:19.625
Yes.

01:48:19.625 --> 01:48:20.125
That's all.

01:48:20.125 --> 01:48:21.060
-OK, thank you.

01:48:21.060 --> 01:48:22.890
Thank you so much.

01:48:22.890 --> 01:48:26.390
So the question about
this blending, this

01:48:26.390 --> 01:48:29.240
is the final question,
about should we

01:48:29.240 --> 01:48:32.270
be keeping refugee and
migration regimes separate,

01:48:32.270 --> 01:48:36.180
or are they being fused
together [INAUDIBLE]?

01:48:36.180 --> 01:48:39.760
-I would say, first of all, we
have to start from the premise

01:48:39.760 --> 01:48:44.110
that whether you're a refugee or
a migrant, you're a human being

01:48:44.110 --> 01:48:46.960
and you enjoy human rights,
regardless of where you are.

01:48:46.960 --> 01:48:51.330
So there are legal distinctions
between refugees and migrants,

01:48:51.330 --> 01:48:54.210
and in the summit those
legal distinctions

01:48:54.210 --> 01:48:57.060
are maintained, because
there is a difference

01:48:57.060 --> 01:49:01.570
between-- the situation
of refugees is different,

01:49:01.570 --> 01:49:05.450
in that if they're
returned to their homes,

01:49:05.450 --> 01:49:09.960
they will face persecution
or danger that will affect

01:49:09.960 --> 01:49:11.240
their life or health.

01:49:11.240 --> 01:49:15.070
And that is different from the
situation of a migrant, who

01:49:15.070 --> 01:49:18.660
may go home to a difficult
situation, but perhaps not one

01:49:18.660 --> 01:49:24.240
that would cause him to suffer
persecution, or put his life

01:49:24.240 --> 01:49:25.420
or health at risk.

01:49:25.420 --> 01:49:29.440
So within the legal regime the
distinctions are being made,

01:49:29.440 --> 01:49:36.440
but there is more attention
to the issue of migrants

01:49:36.440 --> 01:49:39.230
who do not qualify
as refugees, but who

01:49:39.230 --> 01:49:42.820
do need significant-- do need
human rights protections,

01:49:42.820 --> 01:49:48.580
and may need special assistance
because of the horrible dangers

01:49:48.580 --> 01:49:51.900
that they face, either as
victims of trafficking,

01:49:51.900 --> 01:49:55.060
they may need protection
as unaccompanied children,

01:49:55.060 --> 01:49:58.470
they may need special support
because of the dangers

01:49:58.470 --> 01:49:59.640
that they've faced.

01:49:59.640 --> 01:50:03.124
For example, in those horrible
boats where people's lives

01:50:03.124 --> 01:50:04.040
are being put at risk.

01:50:04.040 --> 01:50:06.600
So while the legal
distinctions are maintained,

01:50:06.600 --> 01:50:10.440
it is important to extend
the protections that

01:50:10.440 --> 01:50:12.250
are necessary to each.

01:50:12.250 --> 01:50:15.460
But I want to say one more thing
about how we can get involved,

01:50:15.460 --> 01:50:17.980
because I think we've
touched on civil society

01:50:17.980 --> 01:50:20.500
involvement and
financial support,

01:50:20.500 --> 01:50:22.800
and we've talked about
the political side.

01:50:22.800 --> 01:50:25.250
Another part of it,
and this comes really

01:50:25.250 --> 01:50:27.840
from the consultations
that we did with refugees

01:50:27.840 --> 01:50:30.430
before the summit, the one
thing that refugees have said--

01:50:30.430 --> 01:50:32.760
the question was,
what do you want

01:50:32.760 --> 01:50:35.280
world leaders to know
about refugees that they

01:50:35.280 --> 01:50:36.699
just critically misunderstand?

01:50:36.699 --> 01:50:38.990
And we asked that question
in a lot of different groups

01:50:38.990 --> 01:50:42.040
of refugees, and the answer
was almost always the same,

01:50:42.040 --> 01:50:44.582
is that we have a lot to offer.

01:50:44.582 --> 01:50:46.540
We are good at what we
do, we're professionals.

01:50:46.540 --> 01:50:50.020
So one more thing that you can
do is you can hire a refugee.

01:50:50.020 --> 01:50:53.200
Because look, refugees
are really-- they

01:50:53.200 --> 01:50:55.000
can be fantastic employees.

01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:57.890
We have lots of
data to show that.

01:50:57.890 --> 01:51:01.214
And they're not a
burden on society.

01:51:01.214 --> 01:51:03.130
Refugees don't like to
be considered a burden.

01:51:03.130 --> 01:51:06.360
That term burden sharing
in the 1951 Convention

01:51:06.360 --> 01:51:07.291
is annoying to most.

01:51:07.291 --> 01:51:08.290
-Responsibility sharing.

01:51:08.290 --> 01:51:10.110
-Well, we tried to
change it responsibility,

01:51:10.110 --> 01:51:11.340
but that's a whole, long debate.

01:51:11.340 --> 01:51:12.760
Member states don't
agree to that.

01:51:12.760 --> 01:51:15.020
The word in the
convention is burden,

01:51:15.020 --> 01:51:17.300
but refugees don't like
it, and I understand that.

01:51:17.300 --> 01:51:19.770
So hire a refugee and I
don't think you'll regret it.

01:51:19.770 --> 01:51:20.570
-Thank you so much.

01:51:20.570 --> 01:51:21.070
[LAUGHTER]

01:51:21.070 --> 01:51:24.180
-Well, let me just say this
has been a fabulous, if

01:51:24.180 --> 01:51:27.330
sobering symposium,
and I want to thank you

01:51:27.330 --> 01:51:30.020
all very much for being here.

01:51:30.020 --> 01:51:32.580
And I want to ask the
audience to join me

01:51:32.580 --> 01:51:33.870
in thanking you with applause.

01:51:33.870 --> 01:51:34.370
[APPLAUSE]

01:51:34.370 --> 01:51:36.820
