00:00:02.877 --> 00:00:05.213
[explosion]

00:00:05.213 --> 00:00:07.173
Lord Almighty.

00:00:07.173 --> 00:00:08.842
I have to go
out of town again.

00:00:08.842 --> 00:00:10.218
What's going on?

00:00:10.218 --> 00:00:11.636
I can't really say.

00:00:11.636 --> 00:00:13.972
So is this how it's
going to be from now on?

00:00:13.972 --> 00:00:16.433
Are you keeping secrets
from me all the time?

00:00:16.433 --> 00:00:18.768
Amy, everything is fine.

00:00:18.768 --> 00:00:20.061
I promise.

00:00:20.061 --> 00:00:21.479
The night this
took place, what

00:00:21.479 --> 00:00:24.899
exactly was the first
thing that you remember?

00:00:24.899 --> 00:00:27.694
Well, the monster--
[screaming]

00:00:27.694 --> 00:00:30.155
--it had these big round eyes.

00:00:30.155 --> 00:00:33.074
We saw parts of the spacecraft
scattered all around.

00:00:33.074 --> 00:00:34.659
[shouting]

00:00:34.659 --> 00:00:36.161
One of them must have been
the engine because it was

00:00:36.161 --> 00:00:37.829
still glowing when we saw it.

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.122
That was that.

00:00:39.122 --> 00:00:42.751
That is part of
the alien spaceship,

00:00:42.751 --> 00:00:45.503
or as Sara called
it, the Red Diamond.

00:00:45.503 --> 00:00:48.214
So where are we going, Missy?

00:00:48.214 --> 00:00:51.843
Well, there is this one place.

00:00:51.843 --> 00:00:55.930
They read poetry
and smoke reefer.

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.057
I don't know
what to say, Mamie.

00:00:58.057 --> 00:01:00.185
You are my kind of girl.

00:01:00.185 --> 00:01:02.645
I have a date I
need to get ready for.

00:01:02.645 --> 00:01:06.149
Perhaps you can make yourself
useful while I'm gone.

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:07.484
Yes, ma'am.

00:01:07.484 --> 00:01:10.862
I'll leave you the address.

00:01:10.862 --> 00:01:13.072
Don't be sloppy.

00:01:13.072 --> 00:01:15.116
You don't like it here.

00:01:15.116 --> 00:01:16.534
It's just so--

00:01:16.534 --> 00:01:18.495
Different.

00:01:18.495 --> 00:01:20.580
You just need to loosen up.

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.373
You just need a little help.

00:01:22.373 --> 00:01:26.085
Maybe you should
tell me what you want.

00:01:26.085 --> 00:01:27.045
Stay here.

00:01:27.045 --> 00:01:28.755
I'll be right back.

00:01:28.755 --> 00:01:31.090
Want to feel all right?

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.758
Don't be shy.

00:01:35.637 --> 00:01:39.098
The red streak across
the sky does point

00:01:39.098 --> 00:01:41.100
to something extraterrestrial.

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.769
Lord, I knew it.

00:01:42.769 --> 00:01:43.978
It was a meteor.

00:01:43.978 --> 00:01:46.064
But what about what we saw?

00:01:46.064 --> 00:01:48.566
A meteor can't explain that.

00:01:48.566 --> 00:01:50.860
We have what we need to write
up a report and close the case.

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.862
- Oh, not everything.
- Oh, you found a meteor.

00:01:52.862 --> 00:01:54.113
What more we looking for here?

00:01:54.113 --> 00:01:55.865
Something to
explain the creature.

00:01:55.865 --> 00:01:57.659
You read the case file.

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.786
There was one other witness.

00:01:59.786 --> 00:02:02.872
We told Evelyn
you were coming.

00:02:02.872 --> 00:02:05.667
But I'm not sure
what you'll get.

00:02:05.667 --> 00:02:09.087
She still thinks Lincoln's
president sometimes.

00:02:09.087 --> 00:02:12.632
Miss Myers, is
this what you saw?

00:02:12.632 --> 00:02:13.800
Yes, that was it.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:19.430
It showed me the
end of all things.

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.519
The others that came to see
me before you believed me.

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:30.358
The men in hats,
they were scared.

00:02:30.358 --> 00:02:31.734
So should you be.

00:02:31.734 --> 00:02:33.528
There's gotta
be an explanation.

00:02:33.528 --> 00:02:34.988
[screeching]

00:02:34.988 --> 00:02:36.906
Oh.

00:02:36.906 --> 00:02:38.825
Good luck, Captain.

00:02:38.825 --> 00:02:41.661
We have just found
the Flatwoods monster.

00:02:41.661 --> 00:02:43.371
You've all heard the
story about what happened

00:02:43.371 --> 00:02:44.163
in the woods that night.

00:02:46.916 --> 00:02:49.085
Nothing more than
a great horned owl.

00:02:49.085 --> 00:02:53.590
Take a good look,
and the only logical,

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:54.966
scientific explanation.

00:02:54.966 --> 00:02:55.967
[crowd murmurs]

00:02:55.967 --> 00:02:56.885
Excuse me.

00:02:56.885 --> 00:02:58.720
Hello!

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.055
We need to make one more stop.

00:03:01.055 --> 00:03:03.182
He told me you'd be back.

00:03:03.182 --> 00:03:05.727
He left this for you.

00:03:05.727 --> 00:03:07.854
How does he even know me?

00:03:07.854 --> 00:03:10.899
He only knows what
you want, the truth.

00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:13.610
Look, Professor,
you're still new to this.

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.987
So let me give you the
answer to the exam, OK?

00:03:15.987 --> 00:03:17.822
Spaceships, aliens,
all this stuff

00:03:17.822 --> 00:03:19.782
we're asked to
investigate, the Air Force

00:03:19.782 --> 00:03:21.200
knows they don't exist.

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.994
There is nothing that
can come out of that sky

00:03:22.994 --> 00:03:24.037
that you or I can't explain.

00:03:27.832 --> 00:03:30.209
Is a meteor all that we found?

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:31.836
At the site, it seemed
to me there may have

00:03:31.836 --> 00:03:34.839
been something else removed.

00:03:34.839 --> 00:03:36.466
What's under the tarp?

00:03:36.466 --> 00:03:38.843
You know, if I could just
take a look for my research.

00:03:38.843 --> 00:03:43.014
Your research is
now our research.

00:03:43.014 --> 00:03:44.182
Gentlemen?

00:03:44.182 --> 00:03:45.558
Sir.

00:03:45.558 --> 00:03:46.768
I think the doctor
will perform his role

00:03:46.768 --> 00:03:49.062
rather well, don't you?

00:03:49.062 --> 00:03:50.647
There's something
off about him.

00:03:55.151 --> 00:03:56.945
- Hello.
- (ON PHONE) Good, I caught you.

00:03:56.945 --> 00:03:59.238
Craig told me you had a
question for the generals.

00:03:59.238 --> 00:04:00.740
Ask me first, OK?

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:02.992
That'll make both their
lives a whole lot easier.

00:04:02.992 --> 00:04:04.911
OK, Captain, whatever you say.

00:04:08.206 --> 00:04:11.042
Eric, so tomorrow, see
you bright and early.

00:04:11.042 --> 00:04:13.378
The consequences
of our actions impact

00:04:13.378 --> 00:04:16.506
every man, woman, and
child on the planet.

00:04:16.506 --> 00:04:19.801
It's up to us to make sure that
their fate is in good hands.

00:04:19.801 --> 00:04:23.054
