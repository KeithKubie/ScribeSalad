00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:04.930
&gt;&gt;Todd: It's my pleasure today to introduce
George Anders, who is

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:08.500
the author of this great new book called "The
Rare Find:

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.360
Spoting Exceptional Talent Befor Everybody
Else."

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:13.670
Just a few minutes on
background on George.

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:18.840
He is the author of four books and
is a frequent contributor to Wall Street Journal,

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.170
Fast
Company, the Bloomberg View and actually shared

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.600
a Pulitzer
Prize in 1997 for national reporting . That's

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:26.600
really cool.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:27.600
I don't have one of those.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:28.600
That's nice.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.119
And he spent two and a half years
researching this book to basically talking

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:38.350
to a huge number
of people executive recruiters to sports talent

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:43.280
scouts to
Army special forces to Teach for America to

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.010
the MacArthur
Foundation, just a whole ton of people who

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.350
are all in
the business of finding amazing people but

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.449
maybe looking
at it in a different way than we're used to.

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:56.609
So I think this is particularly relevant for
Google is that we have as a lot of you guys

00:00:56.609 --> 00:01:00.039
are recruiters and we have a very specific
way that Google finds people.

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:04.480
And as I read through this
book, it really turned my world upside down

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.760
thinking about a whole bunch of
different ways we should be looking for talent.

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.290
So we asked George here to talk about a bunch
of different ways

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:14.010
he's found.

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.140
Look forward we're going to maybe do 40
minutes for Q and A and definitely leave lots

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.010
of time for
you guys to ask questions at the end.

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:22.010
So welcome George.

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:23.010
&gt;&gt;George: Thank you.

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:24.780
Thanks for the chance to be here.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.430
&gt;&gt; [Applause]

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.690
&gt;&gt; Todd: So one of the things I wanted to
kind of start with is

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:32.800
just broadly assessing talents.

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.620
So you did this.

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:39.340
One of
the things you profiled is the puzzle master

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.070
at Facebook
and just the whole concept of using puzzles

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:43.490
to select
people.

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:44.880
Something Google used to do; doesn't do as
much

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:45.880
anymore.

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:52.020
Can you talk about what you saw from them
and how different companies use puzzles.

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.420
&gt;&gt; George: Sure glad to.

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.570
We need a little bit of context history
on this one.

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:03.490
Turn the clock back to 2006 and at that
time Facebook is 20, 25 people on University

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:04.490
Avenue.

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.140
Their recruiting department is at most one
and a half

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:09.140
people.

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.330
They know the best engineers are wanting to
come to

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.299
Google, wanting to come to Microsoft.

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:16.849
There are other tech companies at
play.

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:19.459
How in the world are they going to compete?

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:22.159
They
can't get to as many campuses as you can let

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:24.340
alone
Microsoft can.

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.129
They're still selling a story that takes
a little while to chew over and figure out

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:30.099
is this going
to work or not.

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:35.909
And what they wanted is a way to find
the unexpected, out of the way gifted coder

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:38.290
who wasn't
going to be seen on the usual stops through

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.749
MIT, Carnegie
Mellon, Stanford what have you.

00:02:41.749 --> 00:02:47.860
And they put up very entertaining and
amusing puzzles involving refrigerators full

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.499
of Red Bull
and people with stay-at-home cats and the

00:02:50.499 --> 00:02:53.670
like but in the end they all turn
out to be database and sorting problems.

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.969
They just have
adorable names to them and everything.

00:02:56.969 --> 00:02:59.650
And welcome to
all comers.

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.560
The simple puzzles were an hour, an hour and
a half to do.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:04.829
The hard ones were ten hours.

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:07.310
I think they had one or two that figured were
40 hour

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:08.310
puzzles.

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.799
So one of the things you get is you make your
puzzles that long is you find out

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:13.470
who really likes to write code.

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.109
Because it's not enough
to just be able to do some of the typical

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:19.599
brain teasers
you'll ask in an interview which identify

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:21.989
people who are
very quick and facile.

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:26.780
This is someone who thinks why go
out Friday when there's another 150 lines

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.930
of python I could be
writing?

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.849
So that's a useful thing to select for.

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:33.940
So
their showcase discovery for this and I spend

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:37.669
a bunch of time on this in the story is a
guy named Evan Priestly.

00:03:37.669 --> 00:03:40.049
Evan
dropped out of college because it was too

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:41.049
easy.

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:44.409
So you
wouldn't find him looking in college graduates.

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:46.879
You also
wouldn't find him looking in high school graduates

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:49.169
because he never quite finished high school
for the same

00:03:49.169 --> 00:03:50.169
reason.

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:54.730
Switched majors three times looking for some
field at Southern Maine University that would

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:55.730
keep him going.

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:57.909
Nothing quite
worked and he ended up in a web development

00:03:57.909 --> 00:04:01.859
shop and
sharpened up his skills on his own and was

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:04.739
a formidable
coder in a very out of the way place.

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:05.739
Recruiters don't
come to Portland.

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:07.769
The only reason you're going to be there is
you're

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:10.409
on summer vacation and then you're not looking
for

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:11.779
candidates.

00:04:11.779 --> 00:04:13.249
So what does he do?

00:04:13.249 --> 00:04:16.530
He answers the puzzle,
sends in the solution.

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:19.352
It's all automatically coded so
you can tell who's solved it right.

00:04:19.352 --> 00:04:21.320
The good solutions
bubble up to the top.

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:22.630
They get called for interviews.

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:24.410
They come out to Palo Alto.

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:27.480
He gets
asked the standard questions and they explains

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.220
the answer
you want but your code is set up so badly

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:33.340
that you're wasting
a whole lot of time querying on database back

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:34.340
and forth.

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.380
If you wrote it better you wouldn't
have this problem which is total Evan.

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:41.280
Manners and
diplomacy are not part of his skill set but

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.170
really great
coding is.

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:46.340
So he gets an offer and he goes
on to do great things for them.

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:50.160
What I like about that
story is it spoke to the long tail of talent.

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.540
Because I think we all are
in a situation where you can know where the

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:54.760
best people are
going to be.

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:58.650
Where you're most likely to find a payoff
and the question is how much farther do you

00:04:58.650 --> 00:04:59.710
go?

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:02.541
What can
you do to track down the people not just at

00:05:02.541 --> 00:05:04.890
school number 1, or 11, or 21 on your list
but

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:07.980
school number 201 or the people who didn't
graduate from

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:09.870
school number 201.

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:13.620
And usually the problem is that the vanishingly
small population that you

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:17.770
can't send recruiters out on the road to do
presentations at these schools.

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:21.090
You may hire one person from them in every
ten years.

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:24.110
And what
this system did was to search for those people

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:28.780
automatically with just a little bit of story
telling,

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:34.030
make it seem appealing to come into this coding
environment and then to bubble up to the top

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:36.540
the people
who are really going to be good candidates.

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:39.280
So nice way
to hunt.

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.080
Not the only way to find programmers.

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:43.860
Probably only an ancillary way but one that
potentially

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:44.990
useful.

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:47.780
&gt;&gt; Todd: So let's talk about the long tail.

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:50.830
Because I think
that's something that Google we get thousands

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:53.960
and thousands of resumes
every day and we see a lot of the long tail

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:56.620
and a lot of
our guys spend a lot of time trying to pick

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:58.810
the good ones
out of the long tail.

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:02.280
And one of the things you talk about was the
concept of people who have jagged

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:03.280
resumes.

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.170
He sounded like somebody who had a jagged
resume.

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:09.120
Can you kind of explain the concept of what
you think a jagged resumes and how do we look

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.890
for people with interesting
jagged resumes?

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:12.890
&gt;&gt; George: Absolutely.

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:15.420
This is a core idea in the book.

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:17.620
Right
now we have an environment where we're taught

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:20.390
whenever we
prepare our own resume make everything look

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:23.630
like an
uninterrupted march of success And each new

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:26.940
job is a
promotion or at best a broadening lateral

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:27.940
transfer.

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:29.760
No
one ever takes a step back.

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:32.550
We always leave to pursue
even bigger opportunities.

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:37.050
We never get in an argument
with a boss and on and on.

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:40.020
But the fact of the matter
is some of the most interesting candidates

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:42.160
do have
zigzags in their resumes.

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:45.100
Sometimes it's the zigzag that
makes them stronger.

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:48.380
You can look at almost any
successful entrepreneur and part of the reason

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:50.140
they're
running a company on their own is because

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:52.510
they couldn't
work for anyone else.

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:56.400
You can look at people in new
fields and there may not be anyone with ten

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:57.790
years of
experience.

00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:01.800
People may swoop in from unexpected ways,
self-teach themselves

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:04.730
what they need to know and go onto accomplish
a lot.

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:08.750
So
the traditional call it McKinsey, Bain model

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:11.110
we're looking
for the best graduates from the best schools

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:14.990
who did the best internships may or may
not work for them.

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:18.860
But especially in technical fields,
especially in fast-changing areas some of

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:22.530
your most
interesting people are going to bounce around.

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:24.860
When
I do talk far enough outside Silicon Valley

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:27.730
I put Steve
jobs resume at two different stages.

00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:30.590
And if I don't put
his name on it I can briefly fool people.

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:33.660
And I go,
"would you fund a guy who was a dropout from

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:38.570
Reed College,
whose previous business was border line legal

00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:42.880
illegal of
hacking into phones and whose appearance and

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:45.850
presentation
hardly looked like a successful entrepreneur."

00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:50.120
And the answer is you bet
you should and Don Valentine at Sequoia Capital

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:53.110
did and that’s why it worked out enormously
well for everyone.

00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:57.360
But you could come up right there with three
flags of why this is an imperfect resume and

00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:59.630
you
shouldn't bankroll someone like that.

00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:01.800
So when I talk about the jagged resume it's
a

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:05.331
way of saying loosen up some of those parameters
that are so

00:08:05.331 --> 00:08:08.730
absolute that you start to miss people who
are interesting and on the

00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:09.840
edge.

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:13.620
&gt;&gt;Todd: I think that's what we're all trying
to do here.

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:15.810
You
profile some interesting people in the book

00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:17.980
who are
particularly good at doing that.

00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:20.770
Some of them were at
the University of Utah.

00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:23.170
&gt;&gt;George: There's a wonderful story in it.

00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:25.210
It has a pedigree
too as most stories do.

00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:29.450
When I was getting started on this book, I
had a breakfast with Andy Grove, the

00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:32.510
former CEO of Intel and mentioned I was doing
this.

00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:36.030
Dr. Grove, as some of you may know, has opinions
on everything.

00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:37.330
They tend to be
strong opinions.

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:40.030
He is not shy to share them.

00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:42.570
His advice to me was "You need
to go to Utah.

00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:46.090
You need to figure out how they got good
at computer graphics because that was always

00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:47.700
a hard area for us.

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:49.330
And what was their secret?"

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:51.620
So two or three weeks later
I'm on a plane.

00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:53.480
I land in Salt Lake City.

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:57.500
I go into the
University of Utah library and they have all

00:08:57.500 --> 00:08:59.770
the working
papers of the first chairman of the computer

00:08:59.770 --> 00:09:02.430
science department,
David Evans.

00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:06.150
He was the first chairman and also the first
secretary, first janitor,

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:07.920
first everything because it was a one person
department

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:09.550
when it got started.

00:09:09.550 --> 00:09:14.810
But he showed up in 1965 and set out
to look for people who could help him explore

00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:16.230
the
frontier.

00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:19.010
And thats really the key concept there is
the frontier.

00:09:19.010 --> 00:09:24.260
At that time computers were not especially
easy to use, these were still Teletype terminals

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.560
and also it was ones and zeros; it was data.

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:29.030
And his thinking was
there was a whole new realm that could be

00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:31.340
opened up if we
could make this visual.

00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:35.540
And that meant standing in
opposition to 90-95% of the research at the

00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:38.200
time because there were all kinds of
things you could do to make computers run

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:41.570
faster and
process data better.

00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:45.000
But there was this small tribe that he
assembled that said we're going to make this

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.300
look better.

00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:48.930
And he ended up getting the ultimate founders
or

00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:53.360
cofounders of Pixar, of Adobe, Alan Kay who's
worked on

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:58.890
the Macintosh and very influential, Jim Clark,
Silicon Graphics and Netscape.

00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:01.620
They all came in as
graduate students for him.

00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:04.250
All of them were people who
had jagged resumés to the extreme.

00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:05.750
They had been
bouncing around.

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:07.110
They had been in the Navy for a bit.

00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:10.560
They'd been working for Boeing and got sacked
in a round of layoffs.

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:13.589
They considered going into animation then
dropped that.

00:10:13.589 --> 00:10:15.950
But what he liked about them was their hunger
for

00:10:15.950 --> 00:10:17.839
Discovery, their desire to find something
new.

00:10:17.839 --> 00:10:20.650
His
feeling was if you've got that level of motivation

00:10:20.650 --> 00:10:23.360
and
passion I can find projects for you that will

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:25.110
put you on
focus.

00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:28.570
His style was to pose six word, eight word
questions

00:10:28.570 --> 00:10:31.300
"Could you do this?"

00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:34.470
And the first thought was my God that's
impossible.

00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:39.300
Someday it will be possible and I'd like to
be the person to figure out how to do it.

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:43.230
And it was a
talent laboratory like no other one.

00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:46.100
An awful lot of it was just looking for these
free spirits,

00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:49.480
unexpected people who just wanted to get to
the frontier.

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:53.730
&gt;&gt; Todd: And so, when he was able to do that,
what have you

00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:56.540
seen in the talent scouts themselves?

00:10:56.540 --> 00:10:57.540
Their ability too.

00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:00.410
Because we'll see people like that and we
could hire them

00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:01.410
and they could be terrible.

00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:05.180
But some people are better
talent scouts at picking that out and noticing

00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:06.180
that.

00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:08.300
What
are the characteristics of a good executive

00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:11.760
recruiter or a good talent scout
that you find that these guys can come from?

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:14.500
&gt;&gt; George: So the first concept I want to
introduce is managing

00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:15.500
risk.

00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:17.090
If you're hiring someone for a million dollar
a

00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:20.960
year position with 500 people reporting to
him, you

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:21.960
better not get that wrong.

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:25.740
There are an awful lot of
things that can go wrong and that's a big

00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:27.850
dent to the
organization.

00:11:27.850 --> 00:11:34.210
If you're picking up someone for a summer
internship or for a contract for six months

00:11:34.210 --> 00:11:36.300
you can try a lot
more experiments.

00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:40.779
You can afford to take those long shots, what
I call in the book lottery tickets.

00:11:40.779 --> 00:11:46.620
So how you select is important but also
how you evaluate risks and when you know when

00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:49.529
to play it
safe and when you know to take a chance.

00:11:49.529 --> 00:11:52.920
At one stage in doing
the book I drew up a whole spectrum chart

00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:56.410
that streched like this.

00:11:56.410 --> 00:11:58.550
One
end of the spectrum to the other of tolerance

00:11:58.550 --> 00:11:59.550
for risk.

00:11:59.550 --> 00:12:01.940
And at the far left end I put airplane pilots.

00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:04.240
And you really
need to land the plane right every time.

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:07.920
You can't get someone who's got creative
ideas about landing a plane.

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:11.110
[laughter]
And then at the other end I put art galleries.

00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:13.030
There you're looking for something people
have

00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:14.030
never seen before.

00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:18.800
In fact, one art gallery operator that I interviewed
said his main criteria for who he would

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:21.960
display is to ask artists "Surprise me."

00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:24.029
And the people
who came up with something nice that's what

00:12:24.029 --> 00:12:27.279
he went with, very successful in his field.

00:12:27.279 --> 00:12:31.030
You could not run pilot
hiring for Delta, United or American by asking

00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:33.550
pilot
candidates "Surprise me."

00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:36.540
What they're going to do to the
plane just shouldn't be done.

00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:39.339
So you need to know where
you are.

00:12:39.339 --> 00:12:41.580
I think that's really the central idea here
is

00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:44.470
evaluate your risks to the position.

00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:46.560
We can talk a
little bit more about once you decide you're

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:49.950
in an area you can
tolerate risk what to look for.

00:12:49.950 --> 00:12:52.750
The key thing is what's
my risk tolerance on this job and that will

00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:53.750
vary hugely.

00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:55.800
That's a big, long chart.

00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:59.440
&gt;&gt; Todd: Can you give us some examples of
companies or

00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:01.960
organizations where they might have a higher
risk

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:07.180
tolerance, the lottery tickets that they're
handing out and

00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:09.750
making little bets on.

00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:10.750
Who's done that well?

00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:12.990
&gt;&gt;George: I got interested in pop music because
there you're

00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:17.370
trying to guess what people want to listen
to six months from now or a year from now

00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:19.890
and knowing
current tastes is perhaps some help but not

00:13:19.890 --> 00:13:20.890
the key
solution.

00:13:20.890 --> 00:13:21.890
You have to take chances.

00:13:21.890 --> 00:13:24.620
You have to try artists that are unexpected.

00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:26.250
Couple things that stood out.

00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:30.680
Traditionally a lot of the
music finding and signing has been done by

00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:34.990
people who
work in the studios that you come up the track

00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:37.970
as someone
who develops the artist sound.

00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:40.840
I'm seeing a second
population that's actually doing quite well

00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:43.580
which is the
people who manage talent once it's out on

00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:44.580
the road.

00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:46.000
Because there are a lot of people who can
sound good in

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:51.000
the studio but success is as much as who can
connect with a fan base?

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.970
Who tours
well?

00:13:52.970 --> 00:13:56.410
Who's a delight on the road and has the stamina
for it?

00:13:56.410 --> 00:13:59.710
It can burn out artists to a terrifying degree.

00:13:59.710 --> 00:14:02.500
So I go through the example of how Taylor
Swift was

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:03.500
discovered.

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:06.709
And a couple points that stand out here, she
had been briefly signed by one of

00:14:06.709 --> 00:14:08.830
the biggest labels which let her go.

00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:13.490
She was in a 15,000
a year development contract by her dad's account

00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:17.180
was not a lot of development that was
happening and they were waiting for her to

00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:18.320
get to 18 or 21.

00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:21.370
She thought she could make it on the pop
charts faster than that.

00:14:21.370 --> 00:14:25.360
She ended up getting signed by
a very small label of a guy who had just split

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:28.580
off from Dreamworks after that part of his
career stalled out.

00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:33.061
And that ability when you're
running something small to take chances, to

00:14:33.061 --> 00:14:36.339
open your
eyes to someone, he liked her sound at first.

00:14:36.339 --> 00:14:38.110
It was
entertaining.

00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:42.060
But we sat and flipped through his diary
and found the moment where he'd written Taylor

00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:43.350
is a star.

00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:45.250
And it wasn't when she first came in.

00:14:45.250 --> 00:14:48.370
It was after she
had gone on a tour to some small Tennessee

00:14:48.370 --> 00:14:51.959
radio station
without a record out yet just playing her

00:14:51.959 --> 00:14:55.000
songs trying to
get station managers to listen to her.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.580
And the
expectation was you come in you don't accomplish

00:14:57.580 --> 00:15:01.250
anything
you come back 6 months later for another visit

00:15:01.250 --> 00:15:03.020
and around
the third or fourth time they finally put

00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:04.410
you on.

00:15:04.410 --> 00:15:07.050
And
she had both the charm and the persistence

00:15:07.050 --> 00:15:09.250
to say that "I'm so
glad you liked my song.

00:15:09.250 --> 00:15:12.991
I think it's this time to play
it for your listeners" and the station manager

00:15:12.991 --> 00:15:13.991
couldn't
say no.

00:15:13.991 --> 00:15:15.310
And she was on the air.

00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:18.320
And that's when Scott Borchetta, the guy running
the label goes "You know what?

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:22.620
She's the one who's going to do very
very well in the world of pop music and is

00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:25.850
going to build
bridges to her fans and the powerful people

00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:28.880
in the
industry that will make her a well, well-known

00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:29.880
talent."

00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:31.339
&gt;&gt;Todd: That's interesting.

00:15:31.339 --> 00:15:35.690
That's something you talk about
what you call a slight flutter you might see

00:15:35.690 --> 00:15:37.580
in a meeting
with somebody.

00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:40.220
It's not, I want to dispel the myth.

00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:43.100
There are people who the first meeting can
know this

00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:45.920
person is bound for greatness.

00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:49.500
They see something that's
a slight flutter and they watch them over

00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:51.440
time and place a big bet.

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:56.899
How can we, we get like I said thousands of
applications a day.

00:15:56.899 --> 00:16:00.930
How do we look for that slight
flutter knowing that there's other people

00:16:00.930 --> 00:16:03.740
who are going
to be put in front of us the next second?

00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:06.070
What do you
look for in that slight flutter?

00:16:06.070 --> 00:16:07.830
&gt;&gt;George: It's an interesting question.

00:16:07.830 --> 00:16:10.910
I'll offer you an
analogy from the book and then we'll bring

00:16:10.910 --> 00:16:13.850
it back to the
world of technical hiring.

00:16:13.850 --> 00:16:18.180
So I track down the baseball
scout who signed Mariano Rivera who's probably

00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:22.529
the greatest relief
pitcher who's ever been in major league ball.

00:16:22.529 --> 00:16:25.020
He was
originally a shortstop, he's Panamanian.

00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:28.420
He was playing in a small town in Panama.

00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:30.830
The scouting
report does not say this guy is going to win

00:16:30.830 --> 00:16:33.080
the MVP in the
World Series.

00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:38.120
It says this guy might have average or
slightly below average major league potential

00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:39.720
but I think
he's worth a try.

00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:44.709
His fast ball is a little slow right
now but his motion looks smooth, it looks

00:16:44.709 --> 00:16:45.709
fluid.

00:16:45.709 --> 00:16:48.060
He looks
like someone who could be a good pitcher and

00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:49.700
key insight, he's skinny.

00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:53.120
He's 6'2 who is 160 pounds or something.

00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:57.590
If he fills out and once he gets on
something other than a Panamian diet he may

00:16:57.590 --> 00:16:58.590
well.

00:16:58.590 --> 00:17:00.830
He could become a lot stronger and more powerful.

00:17:00.830 --> 00:17:04.280
So I think the key in knowing what to do with
the candidates who look slightly

00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:08.670
interesting is to figure out where is their
greatest potential and

00:17:08.670 --> 00:17:11.400
is that in a bounded or unbounded area.

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:15.699
Sports is a good
way to go for this because there you have

00:17:15.699 --> 00:17:17.690
very obvious
physical parameters.

00:17:17.690 --> 00:17:20.500
I remember watching a high school
basketball game.

00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:24.420
There was a 15-year-old player who was playing
well and the scout said you know what?

00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:25.990
He's as good as
he's going to get.

00:17:25.990 --> 00:17:27.209
Look at his muscle development.

00:17:27.209 --> 00:17:29.960
He's got
the body of a 19-year-old or 20-year-old.

00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:30.960
That's why
he's playing well now.

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:32.270
But he's fully developed.

00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:34.580
There's nothing more to come.

00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:37.390
It's much harder when
we're talking about intellectual skills, mental

00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:39.170
skills and the like.

00:17:39.170 --> 00:17:43.299
But I
would come back to a list of traits like creativity,

00:17:43.299 --> 00:17:45.540
curiosity, self-reliance.

00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:47.460
Those tend to be baked in.

00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:50.150
When I was hiring in newspapers, I could never
teach

00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:51.150
curiosity.

00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:52.150
I said I could teach you to be a better
writer.

00:17:52.150 --> 00:17:53.929
I can teach you to be a better reporter.

00:17:53.929 --> 00:17:58.110
If you're not curious about
people, I can't build anything there that

00:17:58.110 --> 00:17:59.380
isn't there.

00:17:59.380 --> 00:18:01.920
So having clear in your mind what are the
skills that I

00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:04.799
absolutely need to have and then what are
some of the

00:18:04.799 --> 00:18:06.620
ones that can grow out.

00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:12.420
If you're talking about would
another couple courses in more advanced computer

00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:14.950
programming skills working on different kinds
of

00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:15.950
projects.

00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:16.950
Could this person grow?

00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:19.900
Being able to gauge
growth is really the key.

00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:21.740
And each field will have its
own matrix.

00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:25.360
I'm not going to try and tell you what the
matrix should be for programmers.

00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:27.360
You know that much
better than I do.

00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:30.640
But that ability to say here's where
the fastest growth is going to happen.

00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:33.360
Here are the
areas where if you're not seeing it at the

00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:35.840
time we're
interviewing there won't be much growth to

00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:36.840
come.

00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:39.150
I think
that helps you find the high potential long

00:18:39.150 --> 00:18:40.150
shots.

00:18:40.150 --> 00:18:43.610
&gt;&gt;Todd: Maybe I'll throw this out as a question
from the audience when we get to the Q and

00:18:43.610 --> 00:18:46.100
A. I would love to hear stories from you guys
if you have

00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:49.380
seen slight flutters in resumes from people
who have come

00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:50.770
here and been successful.

00:18:50.770 --> 00:18:53.040
What have you noticed in the
resume and what have they done?

00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:55.330
A question for the
audience later.

00:18:55.330 --> 00:19:00.830
Another concept you talk about in the
book that I love personally is resilience.

00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:04.070
You give an example from
Teach for America about resilience and I think

00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:06.070
this is a super important concept.

00:19:06.070 --> 00:19:11.000
Can you explain what you learned about resilience
and maybe talk about that Teach for America

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.000
example?

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.000
&gt;&gt;George: Of course.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.510
And let me ask to begin with we've got a
relatively young audience here.

00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:19.550
How many people either
consider Teach for America when you were in

00:19:19.550 --> 00:19:22.400
coming through college or
have friends who did?

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:23.620
Wow.

00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:27.770
Okay so you know the organization
well just to fill in a couple of sentences

00:19:27.770 --> 00:19:31.270
for people who
might not know it as well.

00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:34.360
This is a program that takes
graduates from top schools and gives them

00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:37.330
a chance to
teach for a couple years in some of America's

00:19:37.330 --> 00:19:39.800
most
challenging and most needy schools.

00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:41.210
It's become
tremendously competitive.

00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:45.960
Last year there were close to
50,000 applicants for fewere than 5,000 positions.

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:50.820
They've
got an ability to select on any screens they

00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:51.820
want.

00:19:51.820 --> 00:19:53.830
And
in its early years teach for America was looking

00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:58.820
mainly
for people with charisma, people who were

00:19:58.820 --> 00:20:00.760
enthusiastic, energetic presenters.

00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:03.180
And one of their stock questions
was what is wind?

00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:07.100
And they've got people who could give
you marvelous answers about fluttering of

00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:10.430
angels and the
like but who tended to fall apart in difficult

00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:12.710
school
settings and you show up somewhere where there's

00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:17.250
no heating in the winter or where the textbooks
are defaced and missing pages or

00:20:17.250 --> 00:20:20.710
where there were 31 desks and 36 kids.

00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:23.350
You'll never get
a chance to show them all your wonderful stories

00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:26.669
and insights and
commentary.

00:20:26.669 --> 00:20:32.000
You're gonna be in a position where you're
fighting to keep the classes attention.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.120
So what Teach for
America does now is they look for resilience.

00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:40.040
They look
for people who have persevered in their own

00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:41.040
lives.

00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:42.470
They
look at transcripts differently.

00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:44.841
Overall grade point is
not as important as the slope of your grade

00:20:44.841 --> 00:20:46.000
point.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:50.090
If
you had A's freshman year because you came

00:20:50.090 --> 00:20:52.540
in very well
prepared and then your grade started to go

00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:54.580
down, that's
worrisome.

00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:59.059
If you started out perhaps from a grittier
background yourself with B's first year because

00:20:59.059 --> 00:21:01.020
you were
trying to catch the pace of college and then

00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:05.140
you took
your grades up, there's much more impressive.

00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:07.620
And then
they get to know people's life stories.

00:21:07.620 --> 00:21:11.820
So one of the ones that I
showcase in the book is Emily Louis Monica

00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:17.290
who was a
hurdler competitively in college.

00:21:17.290 --> 00:21:20.860
She only ran for two
seasons and I asked why is that?

00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:23.620
And it turns out Teach
for America had asked her that too.

00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:25.640
She had a stress
fracture in her foot at the end of freshman

00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:27.929
year and
should have never run again.

00:21:27.929 --> 00:21:28.970
But she was competitive.

00:21:28.970 --> 00:21:30.750
She wanted to excel.

00:21:30.750 --> 00:21:35.910
She worked out an entire training
regimen involving mostly swimming pool work

00:21:35.910 --> 00:21:38.799
to build up
her strength and only stepped on the track

00:21:38.799 --> 00:21:40.080
twice her
sophomore year.

00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:43.930
The first was to qualify for the Ivy
League finals and the second when she got

00:21:43.930 --> 00:21:46.230
to the finals was to run them.

00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:48.440
And she
ended up turning in Brown's best time that

00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:49.440
year.

00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:52.429
So that
ability to practice on her own, to set a goal,

00:21:52.429 --> 00:21:56.240
to work
through adversity, and to win recognition.

00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:57.490
You look at that and know what?

00:21:57.490 --> 00:22:01.059
That's someone we can send to north Miami
to a largely Haitian community

00:22:01.059 --> 00:22:02.750
and she'll do fine.

00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:05.730
And sure enough she ends up being
the one who starts the before hours tutoring

00:22:05.730 --> 00:22:08.250
program for the
people who mostly speak Creole and are still

00:22:08.250 --> 00:22:09.970
learning English.

00:22:09.970 --> 00:22:14.809
She helps the D and F students figure out
how to get C's and B's.

00:22:14.809 --> 00:22:17.840
You need an awful lot of
resilience to take a student from the very

00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:20.830
bottom up to
the middle and it's fun to work with the people

00:22:20.830 --> 00:22:22.830
who are
going to be your A and A + students but the

00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:26.059
ability to
say I'm going to make every student a little

00:22:26.059 --> 00:22:29.559
better even if
they're not going to be stars is extraordinary.

00:22:29.559 --> 00:22:31.840
So
resilience is crucial for them.

00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:34.700
I think resilience is
crucial in almost every job.

00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:37.320
Hedge funds spend a lot of
time trying to finding out who can bounce

00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:38.320
back from bad
investments.

00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:41.790
And there are lots of people who can make
money in a bull market.

00:22:41.790 --> 00:22:45.559
But it's a much more distinctive
element to find someone who can ride out their

00:22:45.559 --> 00:22:49.690
bad traits, learn from them
and avoid losing money in a year like 2008

00:22:49.690 --> 00:22:53.600
when the market is just
falling apart.

00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:55.450
Todd had mentioned Army Special Forces.

00:22:55.450 --> 00:22:59.040
They look for tenacity, resilience, grit excessively.

00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:03.549
They send a lot of soldiers into strange valleys
in Afghanistan and Iraq that are not well

00:23:03.549 --> 00:23:05.820
scouted where you don't
know what you're going to find.

00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:08.750
You're not sure who's a friend, who's an enemy.

00:23:08.750 --> 00:23:11.710
You're not going to
storm the hill and conquer it for America.

00:23:11.710 --> 00:23:14.120
This won't be
planting a flag on Iwo Jima.

00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:18.790
This is going to be trying to come to some
sort of truce, stable arrangement for a period

00:23:18.790 --> 00:23:21.230
of months
without American food.

00:23:21.230 --> 00:23:24.280
It's up to you to find the
villager with a goat and figure out some way

00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:26.720
to buy the goat or charm him out of the goat
or do

00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:30.520
whatever you can so you have something you
eat.

00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:32.419
Resilience even in the jobs that we work in.

00:23:32.419 --> 00:23:34.929
Think of
all the projects that get off to a bad start

00:23:34.929 --> 00:23:39.620
or get
retooled or need to be melded into some different

00:23:39.620 --> 00:23:42.570
grand
plan and the people who can bounce back from

00:23:42.570 --> 00:23:44.010
that and say
you know what?

00:23:44.010 --> 00:23:45.690
That's two months of work that went off on
a

00:23:45.690 --> 00:23:48.620
sidetrack but I'm not done yet, I'm coming
back are

00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:50.900
the people who are going to be successful
employees.

00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:53.122
The
people who's feeling is I've given it one

00:23:53.122 --> 00:23:54.870
shot and they didn't like it, I'm done.

00:23:54.870 --> 00:23:56.440
That's going to be more career-limiting.

00:23:56.440 --> 00:24:00.490
&gt;&gt; Todd: One of the things with Teach for
America I thought was also

00:24:00.490 --> 00:24:04.440
interesting was the concept of audition.

00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:07.880
So you profile
this with a couple different organizations.

00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:10.500
So maybe can
you talk about what does Teach for America

00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:14.220
do for
auditions and some of the more intense auditions

00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:15.220
you saw.

00:24:15.220 --> 00:24:17.960
And what do you think an organization like
Google do for

00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:18.960
audition?

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:19.960
&gt;&gt; George: Great.

00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:25.820
So when I say audition, what I'm really
talking about is sustained careful observation.

00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:27.539
And
sustained careful observation is too many

00:24:27.539 --> 00:24:31.720
words and it
lacks sort of the simplicity and the allure

00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:34.809
of the word
audition but it gets at what's really happening.

00:24:34.809 --> 00:24:37.370
You're not just watching someone and holding
up a score

00:24:37.370 --> 00:24:40.710
at the end that says you're a 9 or you're
a 10 and we applaud then kick you

00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:41.710
off.

00:24:41.710 --> 00:24:47.260
What you're doing is you're watching the whole
panorama of someone's achievement and attitude

00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:51.500
and particularly their execution on the little
things.

00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:54.700
This
is a great glimpse into people's work habits.

00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:57.910
And coming
back to an earlier part of the conversation,

00:24:57.910 --> 00:24:59.930
those kind
of habits may be the most enduring and the

00:24:59.930 --> 00:25:00.940
hardest to
change.

00:25:00.940 --> 00:25:05.970
So you want to see someone with good work
ethic, commitment to doing something right.

00:25:05.970 --> 00:25:08.260
and teach for
America's case they have everyone come in

00:25:08.260 --> 00:25:10.080
and teach a
sample lesson.

00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:12.610
So I went up to UC Berkeley.

00:25:12.610 --> 00:25:14.280
It was the
beginning of the recruiting season so you

00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:17.840
got the people that were most eager to get
a job

00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:18.840
at TFA.

00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:22.440
And they all came in in the blue suits and
the other things you do in college when you're

00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:25.090
going for an interview that you really want.

00:25:25.090 --> 00:25:27.870
And
they all had worked up 5 minute lessons.

00:25:27.870 --> 00:25:30.690
And part way through one of the Teach for
America

00:25:30.690 --> 00:25:34.450
managers would shoot up a hand and ask a question
that

00:25:34.450 --> 00:25:37.620
was totally from left field.

00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:41.300
This was essentially
impersonating what's now called the off task

00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:42.300
student.

00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:44.850
When I
went to school, these were called troublemakers.

00:25:44.850 --> 00:25:47.730
[laughter]
It's the same thing.

00:25:47.730 --> 00:25:50.740
And you would then have in live time three
or

00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:54.000
four seconds to figure out do I tell this
kid to be

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:55.000
quiet?

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:56.240
They're interrupting my lesson.

00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:59.240
Do I try and bring them into the conversation
and

00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:01.789
work with whatever glimmer of hope there is
in their

00:26:01.789 --> 00:26:02.789
answer?

00:26:02.789 --> 00:26:05.880
Do I stop my lesson entirely and try and do
a catchup

00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:08.480
lesson for them?

00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:09.750
There's some strategies that work.

00:26:09.750 --> 00:26:12.300
There's some others that mean your whole lesson
plan will disintegrate.

00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:19.480
And you can see with stark separation
there were some students who got it.

00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:22.190
They knew how to
work with that kind of kid and you can go

00:26:22.190 --> 00:26:24.539
into a tough
community, you're going to be fine.

00:26:24.539 --> 00:26:28.060
And then there were
others where my beautiful lesson plan is destroyed

00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:29.419
and I don't
know what to do.

00:26:29.419 --> 00:26:30.840
And they started making arithmetic
mistakes.

00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:35.790
And the whole thing would just come crashing
like a soufflé that's been dropped on the

00:26:35.790 --> 00:26:36.790
floor.

00:26:36.790 --> 00:26:38.490
It's a tough test but
a fair test.

00:26:38.490 --> 00:26:41.620
It's looking for what you really need on something
like that.

00:26:41.620 --> 00:26:44.070
So the other auditions that impressed me.

00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:45.440
I won't tell you stories from all of them
because we've

00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:47.380
got a lot of ground to cover.

00:26:47.380 --> 00:26:50.309
But the key point was look not just for is
there

00:26:50.309 --> 00:26:54.400
something about this person that dazzles but
can they work through all the

00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:56.030
moment to moment issues?

00:26:56.030 --> 00:26:59.260
And when you come to technical
fields, I come back to this notice of seeing

00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:01.860
how someone codes is instructive.

00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:04.240
In some
ways it's similar to my old world of hiring

00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:05.370
people who write.

00:27:05.370 --> 00:27:07.910
There's no better way to
judge someone than to give them a practice

00:27:07.910 --> 00:27:10.730
story
assignment and we put them on contract and

00:27:10.730 --> 00:27:14.970
pay them something for it but the result is
you see not just what the finished draft is

00:27:14.970 --> 00:27:17.230
like but how
long it takes them to do it.

00:27:17.230 --> 00:27:20.640
How many mistakes and
iterations does it go through?

00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:23.539
Are these honest mistakes where you go, you
know

00:27:23.539 --> 00:27:25.880
what, that's easily fixed and it doesn't stress
me or

00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:29.380
are these potentially catastrophic mistakes
where you go you know what?

00:27:29.380 --> 00:27:33.960
If we publish that, we'd be on the
wrong end of the lawsuit or we'd be hurting

00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:36.419
our reputation?

00:27:36.419 --> 00:27:38.770
How well
do people handle all the interpersonal stuff

00:27:38.770 --> 00:27:40.430
on the
project too?

00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:43.020
Coding, what's your annotation look like?

00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:45.580
Does that tell another person enough to understand
how you wrote the

00:27:45.580 --> 00:27:47.910
program the way you did and for them to make
any

00:27:47.910 --> 00:27:50.220
adjustments that they need to?

00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:51.520
In journalism the same thing.

00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:54.840
Are you
wrapping up your interviews on a basis that

00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:57.650
they were comfortable to talking to you or
have

00:27:57.650 --> 00:28:01.130
you trampled on a lot of people and you've
got people complaining that you took things

00:28:01.130 --> 00:28:02.909
out of
context and the like?

00:28:02.909 --> 00:28:05.740
You learn a lot that way.

00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:09.730
So it's
harder in non-performance fields to come up

00:28:09.730 --> 00:28:13.160
with ways to do auditions but I think there
are new opportunities coming

00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:14.740
up in sales.

00:28:14.740 --> 00:28:17.539
I mean they're having people do
presentations.

00:28:17.539 --> 00:28:23.340
You can tell who presents well and who doesn’t
and moving out of the just the conference

00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:28.090
room interview to something that more closely
approximates what people do and the best way

00:28:28.090 --> 00:28:31.740
to get
people for the job is to see them on the job

00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:34.230
as opposed
to trying to extrapolate from what are more

00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:35.580
artificial situations.

00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:41.520
&gt;&gt;Todd: So I think when we, we have mini auditions
here where we bring people in for onsite interviews

00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:44.050
and I think on the
technical side we do ask them to code but

00:28:44.050 --> 00:28:48.850
I also think were
checking for what we call googliness, culture

00:28:48.850 --> 00:28:49.850
fit.

00:28:49.850 --> 00:28:52.580
One of the
stories you profile in your book is about

00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:55.789
the FBI who has
a rule about, I'm not sure if I'm allowed

00:28:55.789 --> 00:28:58.850
to swear in
authors at Google, but they don't want to

00:28:58.850 --> 00:29:02.240
hire any A-holes and that's been that's the
single hiring

00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:04.030
criteria that that guy uses.

00:29:04.030 --> 00:29:07.750
And then he selected everything on top of
that.

00:29:07.750 --> 00:29:10.370
What are some of the things we want to do
slightly

00:29:10.370 --> 00:29:11.370
better than that.

00:29:11.370 --> 00:29:13.120
We want them to be nice and googly.

00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:16.190
I
sometimes talk about the people I interview.

00:29:16.190 --> 00:29:18.539
When I don't want the
interview to end and I want to take them to

00:29:18.539 --> 00:29:19.539
lunch
afterwards.

00:29:19.539 --> 00:29:20.539
That's a good sign.

00:29:20.539 --> 00:29:25.530
So are there other things we can look at
when they come onsite to interview that are

00:29:25.530 --> 00:29:28.740
some glimpse
in to their personality.

00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:33.440
What can we better use that audition for other
than raw technical skills?

00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:37.380
&gt;&gt; George: So I like the idea of having a
culture that has a

00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:38.380
name.

00:29:38.380 --> 00:29:40.539
And I get to visit a lot of organizations
and I'd

00:29:40.539 --> 00:29:43.429
say simply by knowing that you want people
with the

00:29:43.429 --> 00:29:46.659
right amount of googliness you're ahead of
two-thirds of the companies.

00:29:46.659 --> 00:29:48.820
And it's always sad to come into a place where
there isn't a

00:29:48.820 --> 00:29:49.820
defining culture.

00:29:49.820 --> 00:29:53.400
Where it's just you know turn in the
work and try not to get yelled at by the boss

00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:56.450
or by the CEO or
controlling shareholders.

00:29:56.450 --> 00:30:00.770
It's more of a defensive culture where there
isn't a unique way of doing

00:30:00.770 --> 00:30:01.880
things.

00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:07.350
Merely by thinking about googliness you're
taking an important step beyond what other

00:30:07.350 --> 00:30:08.510
people do.

00:30:08.510 --> 00:30:10.590
In
terms of how you draw that out in an interview,

00:30:10.590 --> 00:30:12.480
I've
always believed you learn different things

00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:14.510
about people
in different settings.

00:30:14.510 --> 00:30:18.640
That we have one persona that we
bring into conference room situations.

00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:21.390
We have a
different persona lunch.

00:30:21.390 --> 00:30:25.280
We have a different persona
walk with someone.

00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:30.610
Giving people a chance to show more
of the different aspects of themselves.

00:30:30.610 --> 00:30:33.679
Reference
checks, I mean, there's perfunctory reference

00:30:33.679 --> 00:30:35.260
checks
that get you almost nothing.

00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:37.120
There are the ones much
more detailed.

00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:39.590
The question that I always found elicited
the

00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:42.260
most interesting things was to ask was "What
advice can you

00:30:42.260 --> 00:30:45.570
give me about how to manage this person effectively?"

00:30:45.570 --> 00:30:49.350
Because it's very neutral but it's also some
of way

00:30:49.350 --> 00:30:52.400
failure stress issues.

00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:56.010
Whatever you do don't criticize
this person in public because they'll go ballistic

00:30:56.010 --> 00:30:58.179
and start
screaming and shouting and throwing stuff.

00:30:58.179 --> 00:31:02.300
And you go, okay, that's a good tool to know
but that also tells me something about temper

00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:06.040
that I
otherwise wouldn't have been told.

00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:07.440
That's one way to
draw out.

00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:11.390
In googliness, I always think part of it is
this

00:31:11.390 --> 00:31:16.169
endless insatiable curiosity that goes in
a lot of directions and this desire to find

00:31:16.169 --> 00:31:20.610
the nonobvious
solution that stretching the frontiers of

00:31:20.610 --> 00:31:21.610
knowledge.

00:31:21.610 --> 00:31:24.159
So
I would think that would come up pretty quickly

00:31:24.159 --> 00:31:25.770
in a
conversation that you can tell whether you're

00:31:25.770 --> 00:31:28.960
dealing
with someone who's by the book here's what

00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:31.520
I learned in
the textbook or here's what I think the next

00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:33.940
edition of
the textbook oughta say.

00:31:33.940 --> 00:31:35.740
But give yourself credit.

00:31:35.740 --> 00:31:38.690
You've
done an extraordinary job of hiring.

00:31:38.690 --> 00:31:42.600
Every time I meet
anyone from Google I'm always impressed not

00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:45.980
just with how
smart they are but how wide their contributions

00:31:45.980 --> 00:31:46.980
can be.

00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:50.830
&gt;&gt; Todd: It's kind of a special group to select
for that you

00:31:50.830 --> 00:31:53.890
devote is picking the boss.

00:31:53.890 --> 00:31:58.340
And so, we have some people
here who are leadership recruiters and specifically

00:31:58.340 --> 00:32:01.690
trying to find the next Larry, the next Sergi.

00:32:01.690 --> 00:32:06.020
Tell us a little bit
about, I found a lot of stuff in the book

00:32:06.020 --> 00:32:08.809
really
counterintuitive about I would never have

00:32:08.809 --> 00:32:10.440
guessed that's a
better way to pick a boss.

00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:13.830
Who are the best people at
picking bosses and what do they do?

00:32:13.830 --> 00:32:16.900
&gt;&gt; George: So, when you get all the way up
to the boardroom there's

00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:20.429
an interesting question about whether you
can be both the

00:32:20.429 --> 00:32:23.620
recruiter and assessor and I think one of
the

00:32:23.620 --> 00:32:25.539
challenges, I spend some time on CEO searches
which you

00:32:25.539 --> 00:32:27.020
think can go as well as anything.

00:32:27.020 --> 00:32:31.890
We can certainly
invest more time, more advice, deeper due

00:32:31.890 --> 00:32:34.390
diligence and yet
those tend to be some of the most frustrating

00:32:34.390 --> 00:32:37.240
ones and
they sometimes blow up quite spectacularly.

00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:41.150
And I think
the challenge there is boards when they're

00:32:41.150 --> 00:32:44.190
looking at
candidates are so eager to close the deal

00:32:44.190 --> 00:32:50.130
at a certain point that the who's
selling who relationship inverts and instead

00:32:50.130 --> 00:32:52.809
of trying to get the
candidate to show you all their strengths

00:32:52.809 --> 00:32:55.130
and anything
else you need to know about them pretty soon

00:32:55.130 --> 00:32:57.299
it's the company trying to woo the
candidate.

00:32:57.299 --> 00:33:01.610
And the higher up you go in the power ladder
the better your candidate is going to be at

00:33:01.610 --> 00:33:02.610
this.

00:33:02.610 --> 00:33:06.039
Remember, you're looking for leadership and
part of leadership is turning your meeting

00:33:06.039 --> 00:33:08.070
into their meeting.

00:33:08.070 --> 00:33:12.960
[chuckle] And I did a
profile years ago of Joe Bachelder who's America's

00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:15.290
number one compensation attorney.

00:33:15.290 --> 00:33:18.960
And he said any time he would go
into negotiate a compensation for a new CEO

00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:22.279
with a general
counsel he knew he could get anything he wanted

00:33:22.279 --> 00:33:25.330
because pretty soon, when the deal was over,
that

00:33:25.330 --> 00:33:27.990
general counsel was going to have to report
to this new

00:33:27.990 --> 00:33:32.720
incoming CEO and anything he said no to, maybe
we need new

00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:34.529
general counsel.

00:33:34.529 --> 00:33:40.770
And he could play on that slight edge
of fear quite skillfully so more restricted

00:33:40.770 --> 00:33:45.049
stock, more options, bigger
moving allowance, shorter vesting period.

00:33:45.049 --> 00:33:47.820
All the
dominoes justcame down just one after another.

00:33:47.820 --> 00:33:50.520
And that's a
hard position to be in.

00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:55.419
In the book I spend some time is
it worth outsourcing some level of the due

00:33:55.419 --> 00:33:56.960
diligence on
the candidate.

00:33:56.960 --> 00:34:01.230
Because then you've got this neutral
party that's doing the 4-hour career interview

00:34:01.230 --> 00:34:05.820
and doing the deep dive and that's
picking over not just the trophy moments of

00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:09.139
someone's
career but also the times that were bumpy

00:34:09.139 --> 00:34:12.060
and looking for
some of the interpersonal flags that can come

00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:13.060
up.

00:34:13.060 --> 00:34:15.110
Yes,
you met target but you ended up with a lot

00:34:15.110 --> 00:34:19.109
of unhappy
people along the way and maybe you had legal

00:34:19.109 --> 00:34:20.109
exposure.

00:34:20.109 --> 00:34:21.109
Maybe you had other things.

00:34:21.109 --> 00:34:25.050
So that would be one area where I think
the higher up you go the more argument there

00:34:25.050 --> 00:34:29.659
is for bringing in
outside assessors who can play that neutral

00:34:29.659 --> 00:34:32.290
role.

00:34:32.290 --> 00:34:35.090
Beyond
that there's a Steve Kaplan study from University

00:34:35.090 --> 00:34:36.869
of
Chicago that I found quite impressive where

00:34:36.869 --> 00:34:45.760
he looks at how successful executives score
on various measures of effectiveness, judged

00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:48.130
by their
eventual performance on the job.

00:34:48.130 --> 00:34:53.929
And he found
efficiency, accountability generally hard

00:34:53.929 --> 00:34:59.870
virtues as
opposed to likability tended to be the ones

00:34:59.870 --> 00:35:01.640
that drove
performance.

00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:07.160
And we all like to think of bosses as
ultimately inspiring people who like and love

00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:08.500
and
cherish.

00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:10.369
But I think his point was you need to earn
that

00:35:10.369 --> 00:35:14.990
first by delivering on the job and if you
look only for likeability then you can end

00:35:14.990 --> 00:35:22.380
up with some people who don't set
ambitious goals or who tend to either be too

00:35:22.380 --> 00:35:24.320
eager to please everyone to the point where
there

00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:27.520
aren't strong priorities, there aren't tough
decisions.

00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:31.410
So it was a bit of a tough love message.

00:35:31.410 --> 00:35:33.869
But I think in
terms of getting the absolute best results

00:35:33.869 --> 00:35:35.910
he's got a
point.

00:35:35.910 --> 00:35:39.620
&gt;&gt; Todd: So I want to read a quote, a passage
from the book I

00:35:39.620 --> 00:35:43.820
think would be particularly relevant to Google
here.

00:35:43.820 --> 00:35:46.390
What you write is " As organizations grow
older, a lot of

00:35:46.390 --> 00:35:49.540
that exuberance of early days fades.

00:35:49.540 --> 00:35:53.010
Familiar paths
for adding talent get established.

00:35:53.010 --> 00:35:56.460
Leaders become more
certain about which types of people they want

00:35:56.460 --> 00:35:58.250
and which
they don't want.

00:35:58.250 --> 00:35:59.980
Cultures turn more conservative.

00:35:59.980 --> 00:36:04.020
Unfamiliar ideas of any sort particularly
ones that seemingly involve odd ball

00:36:04.020 --> 00:36:07.180
hires for important jobs are more likely to
be viewed

00:36:07.180 --> 00:36:10.089
with suspicion or disdain."

00:36:10.089 --> 00:36:14.000
So I think a lot of us here
are worried that that will happen as Google

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:19.450
now is
approaching 30,000 people and is not exactly

00:36:19.450 --> 00:36:21.290
the small
startup we used to be.

00:36:21.290 --> 00:36:23.589
So how do we keep this from
happening?

00:36:23.589 --> 00:36:28.150
What can Google do to not have that, not
become more conservative.

00:36:28.150 --> 00:36:32.329
Not just keep on the same path
that we've been doing in the past?

00:36:32.329 --> 00:36:34.740
&gt;&gt; George: So Todd was good enough to give
me a heads up on a

00:36:34.740 --> 00:36:35.980
couple questions coming.

00:36:35.980 --> 00:36:40.531
So I want to share a piece of
valley history that always struck me.

00:36:40.531 --> 00:36:44.580
If you go back to
Hewlett Packard which to some extent defined

00:36:44.580 --> 00:36:46.580
the best of valley culture
for decades.

00:36:46.580 --> 00:36:49.910
I was always impressed in the 1980s with their
big breakthrough.

00:36:49.910 --> 00:36:54.650
The thing that gave them their second or third
lease on life was the work they did in printers

00:36:54.650 --> 00:36:56.480
and and that
came out of San Diego and that came out of

00:36:56.480 --> 00:36:58.859
Boise not out of Palo Alto.

00:36:58.859 --> 00:37:02.160
And I think that ability to get smart people
away from

00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:05.760
headquarters trying new things is hugely important.

00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:09.490
And in fact, if
you look at the early ink jet printers they

00:37:09.490 --> 00:37:10.810
were a mess.

00:37:10.810 --> 00:37:12.380
They were very blotchy.

00:37:12.380 --> 00:37:14.410
They were poor resolution.

00:37:14.410 --> 00:37:17.960
It was for a couple
of years an inferior product.

00:37:17.960 --> 00:37:20.951
But coming back to our
conversation about gauge the upside, look

00:37:20.951 --> 00:37:22.250
for the
opportunity.

00:37:22.250 --> 00:37:24.810
That's true of products as well as people.

00:37:24.810 --> 00:37:28.950
And the early pioneers in Boise , we will
get those

00:37:28.950 --> 00:37:31.099
dots closer together.

00:37:31.099 --> 00:37:34.150
Couple more product cycles and we
will have a printer you can be proud of.

00:37:34.150 --> 00:37:36.980
And it will be
able to print in color and have a much faster

00:37:36.980 --> 00:37:37.980
run rate.

00:37:37.980 --> 00:37:39.520
It will be a lower cost
one.

00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:41.360
And they were stubborn enough to stick it
out and

00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:44.030
ultimately build a multi-multibillion dollar
business

00:37:44.030 --> 00:37:48.490
in spite of a very bumpy meeting in 1984 where
the head guys at headquarters

00:37:48.490 --> 00:37:51.560
said I'm not sure we should be putting this
much into it

00:37:51.560 --> 00:37:56.870
and it took ultimiately support from the CEO
to say yes we should.

00:37:56.870 --> 00:37:58.780
And I think one of
the exciting things about coming into Google

00:37:58.780 --> 00:38:02.290
is how much
you're spreading around the globe.

00:38:02.290 --> 00:38:07.230
I hope some of the
labs you're setting up whether it's Israel

00:38:07.230 --> 00:38:10.250
or Singapore
or other places are not just filling in the

00:38:10.250 --> 00:38:14.530
details for projects here
but looking for big new ideas and bringing

00:38:14.530 --> 00:38:19.080
in the kinds of talent
that is free of whatever those pressures of

00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:20.369
conformity may be at
headquarters.

00:38:20.369 --> 00:38:22.140
I'm sure there will be great things that happen
at

00:38:22.140 --> 00:38:23.410
headquarters too.

00:38:23.410 --> 00:38:28.690
But the ability to have a global presence,
and to have idea

00:38:28.690 --> 00:38:33.670
factories, skunk works, incubator labs that
sometimes can

00:38:33.670 --> 00:38:36.320
try new things because they aren't as closely
watched.

00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:38.400
And they're a little bit more free to stumble
around and

00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:41.530
make those kinds of experiments and early
missteps that

00:38:41.530 --> 00:38:43.920
are part of how most big breakthroughs happen.

00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:45.790
I think
that can be crucial.

00:38:45.790 --> 00:38:48.410
&gt;&gt; Todd: So we should start making printers
is that the

00:38:48.410 --> 00:38:49.410
Suggestion?

00:38:49.410 --> 00:38:50.859
&gt;&gt; George: [laughter] There's still good money
in printers.

00:38:50.859 --> 00:38:52.890
&gt;&gt; Todd: You heard it here.

00:38:52.890 --> 00:38:56.230
How about specifically in selection?

00:38:56.230 --> 00:38:58.910
Larry is always pushing us to
think for the next idea that's going to affect

00:38:58.910 --> 00:39:00.320
a billion
people.

00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:06.119
And we are not, we don't quite get a billion
people applying to Google every year but pretty

00:39:06.119 --> 00:39:07.530
close.

00:39:07.530 --> 00:39:10.700
From selection, let's say you had no constraints
for

00:39:10.700 --> 00:39:13.730
money, no constraints for time ,let's say
even no legal

00:39:13.730 --> 00:39:14.730
constraints.

00:39:14.730 --> 00:39:18.561
What are some of the crazy things we could
try given that we're Google and we have a

00:39:18.561 --> 00:39:22.170
founder who that's not a issue for him to
think bigger.

00:39:22.170 --> 00:39:23.430
That a find.

00:39:23.430 --> 00:39:25.470
We need big bold ideas.

00:39:25.470 --> 00:39:29.280
What's something that you did with some research
that you found that you think

00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:32.610
somebody with Google scale, interesting people,
technology

00:39:32.610 --> 00:39:35.980
what's our next billion dollar idea for selecting
people?

00:39:35.980 --> 00:39:39.820
&gt;&gt; George: Well, there are an awful lot of
us who use Google

00:39:39.820 --> 00:39:43.070
products and you know something about us.

00:39:43.070 --> 00:39:45.600
It generally
tends to be anonymized but since you took

00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:47.500
legal
constraints off table,

00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:50.100
[laughter]
what can you discover from the

00:39:50.100 --> 00:39:52.010
way people use you that say you know what?

00:39:52.010 --> 00:39:53.780
You ought to
be part of team Google.

00:39:53.780 --> 00:39:58.800
There may be a million reasons
why that idea will go nowhere but it's an

00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:01.320
interesting question.

00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:05.980
Are you finding people whose own pursuits
within the

00:40:05.980 --> 00:40:09.250
Google universe are the kind that catch your
eye.

00:40:09.250 --> 00:40:11.320
Is that mischievous
enough for you?

00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:14.400
Does that send your lawyers into
palpitations?

00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:16.410
&gt;&gt; Todd: I'll ask them after the talk.

00:40:16.410 --> 00:40:17.540
That's pretty good.

00:40:17.540 --> 00:40:20.710
Why don't we start to open it up to folks
in the crowd.

00:40:20.710 --> 00:40:22.910
I know we have a lot of folks in recruiting.

00:40:22.910 --> 00:40:25.420
A lot of people who spend a lot of time
looking at resumes.

00:40:25.420 --> 00:40:30.890
If you guys have questions, come up
to the mic.

00:40:30.890 --> 00:40:38.700
&gt;&gt; Male #1: So I've been in staffing for quite
some time.

00:40:38.700 --> 00:40:42.010
There's
a lot of negative stigma around recruiters

00:40:42.010 --> 00:40:44.380
in general and
staffing.

00:40:44.380 --> 00:40:50.900
People love to blame recruiters and staffing
process in a lot of ways for not getting the

00:40:50.900 --> 00:40:54.030
job or for
whatever, however the system breaks down.

00:40:54.030 --> 00:40:57.470
Did you find
that in your research and if so, what did

00:40:57.470 --> 00:40:58.470
you.?

00:40:58.470 --> 00:40:59.500
&gt;&gt;George: So which direction is the arrow
pointing?

00:40:59.500 --> 00:41:01.250
Is this
talking about candidates who feel that the

00:41:01.250 --> 00:41:02.250
recruiters
didn't?

00:41:02.250 --> 00:41:05.060
&gt;&gt; Male #1: Yeah, candidates, hiring managers,
people who aren't part of

00:41:05.060 --> 00:41:06.060
the staffing organization.

00:41:06.060 --> 00:41:07.060
&gt;&gt; George: Okay.

00:41:07.060 --> 00:41:08.060
So you're looking at both sides of the equation—

00:41:08.060 --> 00:41:09.060
&gt;&gt;Male #1: Yes, yes.

00:41:09.060 --> 00:41:10.680
&gt;&gt;George: and you're in this challenging position
of being the

00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:14.210
coupler of a lot of people who may not ever
couple or may

00:41:14.210 --> 00:41:16.840
feel the coupling should have worked on their
end and

00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:18.200
it's the other guy's fault it didn't.

00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:22.170
I think a lot of that
comes with the territory.

00:41:22.170 --> 00:41:26.599
In some cases you're expected
to do the impossible whether it's a very hard

00:41:26.599 --> 00:41:30.151
search to
fill or to bring people's expectations high

00:41:30.151 --> 00:41:33.080
up enough
they become legitimate candidates and then

00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:36.680
somehow manage
the descent back down.

00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:39.970
I think a bit of that just has to
be lived with.

00:41:39.970 --> 00:41:47.710
I think as we move to a world that
there's more data that can be shared on , you

00:41:47.710 --> 00:41:50.510
might be able
to have more transparency going into the company

00:41:50.510 --> 00:41:52.250
of here's
what we do.

00:41:52.250 --> 00:41:55.930
You probably don't want to have more
transparency going out to the candidate because

00:41:55.930 --> 00:41:58.849
that
exposes you to legal risks.

00:41:58.849 --> 00:42:02.520
I think we have to just live
with the fact job searches are a bit of a

00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:04.320
black box.

00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:06.640
As
much as people say they want feedback, in

00:42:06.640 --> 00:42:07.640
some cases they don't really.

00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:09.260
They just want affirmation.

00:42:09.260 --> 00:42:13.720
So in an ideal world you
wouldn't have those sources of friction but

00:42:13.720 --> 00:42:15.700
I think some
of that comes with the job.

00:42:15.700 --> 00:42:19.500
What makes it a high skill
job that requires really bright people with

00:42:19.500 --> 00:42:22.329
a real eye
for the situation.

00:42:22.329 --> 00:42:25.740
If you can take out all of the human
stress you could probably have a job that's

00:42:25.740 --> 00:42:28.280
automated and
offshored and you don't.

00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:29.340
Yeah?

00:42:29.340 --> 00:42:36.660
&gt;&gt; Male #2: As a company like Google gets
big, it develops certain

00:42:36.660 --> 00:42:41.350
processes for [cough] excuse me, for hiring,
for

00:42:41.350 --> 00:42:47.570
interviewing that may go against what you've
said about

00:42:47.570 --> 00:42:51.470
being able to be creative and looking at the
different

00:42:51.470 --> 00:42:52.470
sort of candidates.

00:42:52.470 --> 00:42:58.750
If they don't perhaps fit into a
mold or, you know, process that may say okay

00:42:58.750 --> 00:43:02.079
well we're
going to look at this first and this.

00:43:02.079 --> 00:43:07.390
For example, you
may focus too much on the how does the candidate

00:43:07.390 --> 00:43:10.760
do in
the interview setting and less on what this

00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:16.060
candidate's
experience is over time that they bring to

00:43:16.060 --> 00:43:17.060
us.

00:43:17.060 --> 00:43:20.820
How would
you suggest company avoid falling into that

00:43:20.820 --> 00:43:21.820
trap?

00:43:21.820 --> 00:43:25.320
&gt;&gt;George: So Google being a company that has
a good appreciation

00:43:25.320 --> 00:43:28.800
of data, I would think the way you police
yourself is to

00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:31.900
look at performance of people on the basis
of how they

00:43:31.900 --> 00:43:34.610
scored during the process and then what you
know a year

00:43:34.610 --> 00:43:36.660
or two later and see what kinds of metrics
are helping

00:43:36.660 --> 00:43:39.100
you find great people and what ones are not.

00:43:39.100 --> 00:43:42.770
I know from
my journalism days, one organization I worked

00:43:42.770 --> 00:43:47.339
with there was a painful
drop in the quality of hires when examination

00:43:47.339 --> 00:43:50.040
of writing
samples took a backseat to how well people

00:43:50.040 --> 00:43:51.839
communicated
in interviews.

00:43:51.839 --> 00:43:54.180
And for about a year we hired a whole lot
of very

00:43:54.180 --> 00:43:56.300
charming people who couldn't write worth a
damn.

00:43:56.300 --> 00:43:59.550
[chuckle] And in
the end we're not hiring people to make nice

00:43:59.550 --> 00:44:03.119
conversation
with a hiring editor for an hour.

00:44:03.119 --> 00:44:06.040
We're hiring people to
do great work for a year.

00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:09.250
And I think probably in
technical fields that's doubly and triply

00:44:09.250 --> 00:44:12.960
true and you need some
mechanism of knowing what am I really looking

00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:19.400
for in the interview
as opposed to what's distracting, levels of

00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:24.040
social
connection or nonsocial connection.

00:44:24.040 --> 00:44:25.839
There's one
organization that takes everyone out to lunch

00:44:25.839 --> 00:44:28.859
afterwards
and uses that as a way to gauge people's sociability.

00:44:28.859 --> 00:44:31.090
And I said has anyone ever flunked the lunch
test?

00:44:31.090 --> 00:44:32.890
And
they said no.

00:44:32.890 --> 00:44:34.070
Everyone passes the lunch test.

00:44:34.070 --> 00:44:36.160
They're
all likable in some lunch setting.

00:44:36.160 --> 00:44:38.830
Are you really
getting anything useful then?

00:44:38.830 --> 00:44:40.760
Then it may become a sales
technique.

00:44:40.760 --> 00:44:43.040
It may be part of how you win the person to
come work

00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:44.040
for you.

00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:47.510
But I think particularly in technical fields
figuring out what you're

00:44:47.510 --> 00:44:50.859
trying to accomplish with the social niceties
of the

00:44:50.859 --> 00:44:53.660
interview versus what's actually relevant
to the

00:44:53.660 --> 00:44:54.820
job is important.

00:44:54.820 --> 00:44:58.710
&gt;&gt;Male #2: I think that addresses part of
it.

00:44:58.710 --> 00:45:03.420
Some of it is
really a question about how individuals in

00:45:03.420 --> 00:45:09.230
a larger
setting can kind of buck the tide of okay

00:45:09.230 --> 00:45:10.640
this is the
way we do it.

00:45:10.640 --> 00:45:17.450
This is the path that we evaluate people
and maybe we, I think you made a good point

00:45:17.450 --> 00:45:20.670
about
evaluating the people we have brought on that

00:45:20.670 --> 00:45:24.320
does not
address some very good people that we may

00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:29.770
choose to not
bring on because they didn't fit our predefined

00:45:29.770 --> 00:45:31.410
notion of
how to hire somebody.

00:45:31.410 --> 00:45:33.770
&gt;&gt; George: That's a very good point, the road
less taken is

00:45:33.770 --> 00:45:34.800
hard to see.

00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:38.620
One of the things I do with the book is put
forth the concept of jagged resumes so we've

00:45:38.620 --> 00:45:40.040
got
terminology.

00:45:40.040 --> 00:45:43.099
And I think it's harder when you can't even
explain what you're going at.

00:45:43.099 --> 00:45:45.900
So I've got it into
Harvard business Review now, I'm working to

00:45:45.900 --> 00:45:49.040
spread this
very simple but I think very powerful idea

00:45:49.040 --> 00:45:50.880
and make it part of the
conversation.

00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:51.880
Yeah?

00:45:51.880 --> 00:45:56.610
&gt;&gt; Male #3: Can you talk more about the winning
over a candidate

00:45:56.610 --> 00:45:58.859
from the candidate perspective especially
for established

00:45:58.859 --> 00:46:00.250
places to find talent.

00:46:00.250 --> 00:46:02.820
There's a big talent crunch in
our space.

00:46:02.820 --> 00:46:04.020
And people know we're hiring.

00:46:04.020 --> 00:46:05.020
People know
Google.

00:46:05.020 --> 00:46:06.750
But what are some interesting things you saw
in

00:46:06.750 --> 00:46:08.400
winning candidates over?

00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:14.730
&gt;&gt;George: So I do a section in Chapter 9 about
how Johns Hopkins

00:46:14.730 --> 00:46:17.839
brings people into its surgery residency program.

00:46:17.839 --> 00:46:22.612
They're surgeons see themselves top guns as
doctors and John Hopkins sees itself as a

00:46:22.612 --> 00:46:25.770
top gun school and what impressed me there
is to get

00:46:25.770 --> 00:46:28.690
people to believe in something larger than
themselves.

00:46:28.690 --> 00:46:33.750
It wasn't we pay you the most or you get the
shiniest

00:46:33.750 --> 00:46:35.790
cadavers or whatever.

00:46:35.790 --> 00:46:39.839
It ends up being you are part of a
great, unbroken century-long tradition of

00:46:39.839 --> 00:46:43.930
innovation in medicine that goes all the way
back to William Halsted and

00:46:43.930 --> 00:46:46.500
this is the place where great doctors of the
future were

00:46:46.500 --> 00:46:49.140
formed and you will be surrounded by peers
and colleagues

00:46:49.140 --> 00:46:52.160
who will help you become an extraordinary
healer to the

00:46:52.160 --> 00:46:53.260
world.

00:46:53.260 --> 00:46:55.260
And it's a difficult thing to pull off.

00:46:55.260 --> 00:46:59.430
If you overstate your case it's easy to see
who's sort of

00:46:59.430 --> 00:47:02.270
talking up a story without making good on
it.

00:47:02.270 --> 00:47:05.150
But I
would say that ability to inspire the best

00:47:05.150 --> 00:47:08.240
and brightest
with a sense of this is an extraordinary community

00:47:08.240 --> 00:47:09.920
that
you're coming into.

00:47:09.920 --> 00:47:12.430
People want to tie into an
organization.

00:47:12.430 --> 00:47:17.420
They don't want to be just sort of solo
spores floating around.

00:47:17.420 --> 00:47:21.690
I've looked at some research
studies on task-centered cultures versus people-centered

00:47:21.690 --> 00:47:26.310
cultures and people stay longer in people-centered
cultures including the very best ones.

00:47:26.310 --> 00:47:28.130
That ability to
build those connections.

00:47:28.130 --> 00:47:33.540
But I think that has to be done
deliberately and it has to be done thoughtfully.

00:47:33.540 --> 00:47:34.700
Can't
just happen overnight.

00:47:34.700 --> 00:47:35.700
Yeah?

00:47:35.700 --> 00:47:40.030
&gt;&gt;Female #1: So I really liked what you said
about getting people

00:47:40.030 --> 00:47:42.510
away from smart people away from headquarters
and

00:47:42.510 --> 00:47:44.540
doing new things.

00:47:44.540 --> 00:47:47.460
So I think it's pretty fair to say
when people come to Google they don't want

00:47:47.460 --> 00:47:49.880
to leave for
the most part.

00:47:49.880 --> 00:47:51.150
So I certainly fit that bill.

00:47:51.150 --> 00:47:54.260
But I do
have a very jagged resume before Google.

00:47:54.260 --> 00:47:58.010
So how would
you position yourself if you found yourself

00:47:58.010 --> 00:48:01.160
in a company
that was as amazing as Google for internal

00:48:01.160 --> 00:48:04.130
movement
knowing that now that you are in one role

00:48:04.130 --> 00:48:06.950
that you've
been successful in you don't want to be pigeon

00:48:06.950 --> 00:48:08.489
holed into
just that role.

00:48:08.489 --> 00:48:11.660
&gt;&gt; George: Doesn't it always come down to
that ability to make one or

00:48:11.660 --> 00:48:16.021
two personal connections, that you need to
have a

00:48:16.021 --> 00:48:18.210
champion somewhere.

00:48:18.210 --> 00:48:23.190
And an awful lot of hiring is done
on who do I believe can do the job as opposed

00:48:23.190 --> 00:48:25.319
to do I
have 20 pieces of paper in front of me and

00:48:25.319 --> 00:48:29.230
I shuffle them
and this one is ahead of the other 19.

00:48:29.230 --> 00:48:32.150
I think that
ability to find the team you want to be on,

00:48:32.150 --> 00:48:34.290
get to know
the people there.

00:48:34.290 --> 00:48:37.720
Hopefully impress them with your
ideas, what you can do, how you can build

00:48:37.720 --> 00:48:38.800
it out.

00:48:38.800 --> 00:48:41.390
It's a
challenge because we live in a world where

00:48:41.390 --> 00:48:44.230
credentials
matter and some of them are excellent credentials

00:48:44.230 --> 00:48:47.270
and
some of them are artificial.

00:48:47.270 --> 00:48:50.569
And I'm finding this to a
huge degree with people coming back from Iraq

00:48:50.569 --> 00:48:51.569
and Afghanistan.

00:48:51.569 --> 00:48:55.410
They've had so huge skill
development in terms of mobilizing people,

00:48:55.410 --> 00:48:58.310
running
facilities, safety programs and the like but

00:48:58.310 --> 00:49:01.010
they haven't
picked up the civil engineering letters that

00:49:01.010 --> 00:49:03.180
go after
their name so it's hard to know what to do

00:49:03.180 --> 00:49:04.180
with them.

00:49:04.180 --> 00:49:08.480
I'd so there's no hard substitute for finding
the people you want to work with than

00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:10.760
getting known to them.

00:49:10.760 --> 00:49:15.579
&gt;&gt;Female #2: In a company of our size there
may be people who apply

00:49:15.579 --> 00:49:18.230
to a role thinking that this is what would
be good for them but

00:49:18.230 --> 00:49:21.099
actually they would be a really great fit
for somewhere else in the company that they

00:49:21.099 --> 00:49:23.050
would never think to apply to.

00:49:23.050 --> 00:49:26.339
And I wonder in your research, did you come
across any talent

00:49:26.339 --> 00:49:30.520
scouts or evaluators that said you know they
came across

00:49:30.520 --> 00:49:33.839
looking in one context and said you're not
right for this

00:49:33.839 --> 00:49:38.260
but actually maybe somewhere else is the right
place for

00:49:38.260 --> 00:49:39.260
you.

00:49:39.260 --> 00:49:40.319
Or maybe you'd be good somewhere else and
just sort

00:49:40.319 --> 00:49:43.109
of taking off the blinders of what you're
looking for to

00:49:43.109 --> 00:49:44.730
see if there's another place.

00:49:44.730 --> 00:49:47.500
I was wondering if you
came across any scenarios like that and if

00:49:47.500 --> 00:49:50.950
there are any lessons to be learned about
how to facilitate that better?

00:49:50.950 --> 00:49:55.410
&gt;&gt; George: So you're getting into the very
challenging world of

00:49:55.410 --> 00:49:57.510
internal talent movement.

00:49:57.510 --> 00:50:01.859
And on this book I focused on
the external side, who do you bring into your

00:50:01.859 --> 00:50:02.859
organization.

00:50:02.859 --> 00:50:06.380
But you're absolutely right, some of the
internal challenges are just as big and sometimes

00:50:06.380 --> 00:50:07.599
bigger.

00:50:07.599 --> 00:50:10.720
In a way what we know and don't know about
our own people

00:50:10.720 --> 00:50:12.060
can be quite jarring.

00:50:12.060 --> 00:50:16.980
And when you're under 150 people,
you meet everyone.

00:50:16.980 --> 00:50:18.480
They're all side events.

00:50:18.480 --> 00:50:23.440
It's not
too hard to kind of quietly explore in both

00:50:23.440 --> 00:50:24.440
directions.

00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:25.600
I'm looking for someone who can do this.

00:50:25.600 --> 00:50:27.720
I'd like a
chance to try something else.

00:50:27.720 --> 00:50:30.190
I think it just gets
harder when the team gets bigger.

00:50:30.190 --> 00:50:32.770
I wish there were some
way of solving that.

00:50:32.770 --> 00:50:38.380
I don't know whether a professional
version of social network starts to surface

00:50:38.380 --> 00:50:40.060
people like
that.

00:50:40.060 --> 00:50:43.170
You can just analyze their postings and see
where

00:50:43.170 --> 00:50:46.200
they might have untapped skills.

00:50:46.200 --> 00:50:50.190
But I think you're
going to have to when you get to be 30,000

00:50:50.190 --> 00:50:53.760
people you
almost have to solve that automatically and

00:50:53.760 --> 00:50:57.090
through some
sort of filtering and sorting system.

00:50:57.090 --> 00:51:00.579
It's just too hard
to knit the person to person connections together.

00:51:00.579 --> 00:51:01.740
And
it's a big problem.

00:51:01.740 --> 00:51:02.740
And we have an awful lot.

00:51:02.740 --> 00:51:03.880
IBM
struggles with this.

00:51:03.880 --> 00:51:07.170
They have no end of talented people who are
stuck in wrong jobs.

00:51:07.170 --> 00:51:08.640
And then the question is how do we get you
to the

00:51:08.640 --> 00:51:09.640
right jobs?

00:51:09.640 --> 00:51:11.069
They are still working on it.

00:51:11.069 --> 00:51:14.079
&gt;&gt; Todd: It can be your next book.

00:51:14.079 --> 00:51:16.260
&gt;&gt;Female #3: This might not work.

00:51:16.260 --> 00:51:21.099
So a lot of your earlier
examples revolve around an individual recognizing

00:51:21.099 --> 00:51:23.880
that
slight flutter and taking a risk on a unique

00:51:23.880 --> 00:51:26.670
candidate and having
them end up doing really well.

00:51:26.670 --> 00:51:31.130
Do you think that putting people, putting
candidates through multiple interviewers and

00:51:31.130 --> 00:51:35.319
multiple levels of approval means that those
people with jagged resumés fall out of the

00:51:35.319 --> 00:51:37.290
process?

00:51:37.290 --> 00:51:40.040
As
organizations grow how do we scale the appetite

00:51:40.040 --> 00:51:42.580
for risk
so we don't lose them?

00:51:42.580 --> 00:51:44.839
&gt;&gt;George: That's a big peril.

00:51:44.839 --> 00:51:49.360
As we average in scores we're at risk that
we're

00:51:49.360 --> 00:51:52.260
very good at getting the second decile of
people.

00:51:52.260 --> 00:51:56.589
We know how to weed out the bottom
70 or 80%.

00:51:56.589 --> 00:51:58.290
But that there's really some interesting people
at

00:51:58.290 --> 00:52:01.560
the top of the pool who don't present quite
the way we

00:52:01.560 --> 00:52:06.099
expected and pass them around to enough different
people

00:52:06.099 --> 00:52:07.450
and someone will say no.

00:52:07.450 --> 00:52:13.060
I guess a way you could adjust
for it is to give someone super voting powers

00:52:13.060 --> 00:52:15.240
every now
and then and to say you know what, I feel

00:52:15.240 --> 00:52:18.540
so strongly
about this person that even though I haven't

00:52:18.540 --> 00:52:22.410
won the rest
of the team every I want this to be my bet

00:52:22.410 --> 00:52:26.760
for the year
and some ability to avoid blending down scores

00:52:26.760 --> 00:52:30.760
to the point
you're just hiring the same person in the

00:52:30.760 --> 00:52:31.869
middle all the
time.

00:52:31.869 --> 00:52:33.820
That's an interesting challenge.

00:52:33.820 --> 00:52:36.880
I'm not sure
whether that would work every time or whether

00:52:36.880 --> 00:52:39.930
the
mismatches would be there or not but you're

00:52:39.930 --> 00:52:40.930
right.

00:52:40.930 --> 00:52:43.319
You can
take people around to so many stations that

00:52:43.319 --> 00:52:45.200
in the end
you lose individuality.

00:52:45.200 --> 00:52:46.200
Yes?

00:52:46.200 --> 00:52:53.050
&gt;&gt; Female #4: So my question was around the
big crazy ideas.

00:52:53.050 --> 00:52:55.190
So I
think that there's a lot of crazy things we

00:52:55.190 --> 00:52:58.470
try to do
with our selection processes but the big challenge

00:52:58.470 --> 00:53:01.849
we
face is the effect that doing a crazy idea

00:53:01.849 --> 00:53:04.119
might have on
our employment brand.

00:53:04.119 --> 00:53:09.839
So if people are like " Oh, well Google is
making me do XYZ, I hate Google because of

00:53:09.839 --> 00:53:10.839
it or whatever."

00:53:10.839 --> 00:53:15.100
So I was wondering if you've seen in your
research any of these out of

00:53:15.100 --> 00:53:18.319
the box selection techniques that either move
the needle in a really

00:53:18.319 --> 00:53:21.320
positive way on a company's employment brand
or negative

00:53:21.320 --> 00:53:22.960
way on a company's employment brand?

00:53:22.960 --> 00:53:28.210
&gt;&gt;George: Isn't there a way to try those somewhere
where you can prototype a little bit out of

00:53:28.210 --> 00:53:34.000
the spotlight
and find one state, one country, one division

00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:36.650
where you can
go okay this is only a limited test.

00:53:36.650 --> 00:53:39.620
I mean the consumer
products people do it all the time with virtually

00:53:39.620 --> 00:53:40.670
every
product.

00:53:40.670 --> 00:53:44.430
That way they know which their interesting
idea are and they extend them out to the whole

00:53:44.430 --> 00:53:46.920
world and they let go of problematic ones.

00:53:46.920 --> 00:53:52.020
I was talking to someone who runs the Presidential
Fellows Program and that's sort of a government

00:53:52.020 --> 00:53:53.050
approach.

00:53:53.050 --> 00:53:55.750
You don't want to upend the
whole civil service system.

00:53:55.750 --> 00:53:59.540
It would create untold problems if you did.

00:53:59.540 --> 00:54:02.490
But
you'd like to have these interesting small

00:54:02.490 --> 00:54:06.380
parallel hiring systems
that do look at something sort of more than

00:54:06.380 --> 00:54:08.110
just
traditional evaluation methods.

00:54:08.110 --> 00:54:10.060
Do you have anything in particular?

00:54:10.060 --> 00:54:14.210
That crazy idea that's almost worth trying
but you're not sure

00:54:14.210 --> 00:54:15.599
whether to jump forward or not?

00:54:15.599 --> 00:54:18.880
&gt;&gt;Female #3: I think that we try them and
we almost always do it in

00:54:18.880 --> 00:54:20.690
that way of with pilot groups.

00:54:20.690 --> 00:54:24.780
And then we find ideas that work with the
pilot group and have been shown to be valid

00:54:24.780 --> 00:54:29.359
in terms of
hiring quality people, finding false negatives,

00:54:29.359 --> 00:54:32.550
but we have trouble
implementing them across Google because there's

00:54:32.550 --> 00:54:37.370
this fear
even though it helps us hire really good people

00:54:37.370 --> 00:54:41.760
it's
going to tarnish the Google brand.

00:54:41.760 --> 00:54:44.319
And it's something
that people are super concerned about especially

00:54:44.319 --> 00:54:47.430
since so
many of our candidates are our users and are

00:54:47.430 --> 00:54:49.780
really vocal
already as it is about the process.

00:54:49.780 --> 00:54:54.500
&gt;&gt; George: Yeah, I'd need to know more about
where the resistance

00:54:54.500 --> 00:54:57.751
comes in whether that's top management ,whether
that's

00:54:57.751 --> 00:55:02.010
operating people, where you're sticking point
is.

00:55:02.010 --> 00:55:03.829
But it
seems like a well-run pilot ought to sell

00:55:03.829 --> 00:55:09.530
itself and if you can show
improved results in this culture where, you

00:55:09.530 --> 00:55:11.849
know, data wins.

00:55:11.849 --> 00:55:14.520
If your pilots really do come out that well,
maybe it

00:55:14.520 --> 00:55:16.920
just takes a little longer to implement them
but they shouldn't be

00:55:16.920 --> 00:55:17.920
abandoned.

00:55:17.920 --> 00:55:18.920
It's kinda surprising.

00:55:18.920 --> 00:55:20.450
&gt;&gt; Todd: Let's take one more question.

00:55:20.450 --> 00:55:21.450
&gt;&gt;George: Yeah.

00:55:21.450 --> 00:55:26.910
&gt;&gt;Male #4: You mention that curiosity seemed
to be baked in something that can't really

00:55:26.910 --> 00:55:27.910
be learned.

00:55:27.910 --> 00:55:28.910
What about
resilience?

00:55:28.910 --> 00:55:33.720
Are there situations where somebody doesn't
seem particularly resilient but if they're

00:55:33.720 --> 00:55:37.720
thrown into
the fire or their given the right situation

00:55:37.720 --> 00:55:40.700
they really develop
resilience so it's really hard to tell up

00:55:40.700 --> 00:55:41.700
front.

00:55:41.700 --> 00:55:44.000
&gt;&gt; George: Boy, that's an interesting one.

00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:49.270
I need to have a much
strong background in psychology to be able

00:55:49.270 --> 00:55:53.400
to tell you
for sure.

00:55:53.400 --> 00:55:55.420
In really cruel cultures, you can crush it
in

00:55:55.420 --> 00:55:57.160
people.

00:55:57.160 --> 00:56:03.070
Hopefully none of us live in a society where
that's systemically done, they do exist.

00:56:03.070 --> 00:56:10.090
In terms of can people develop
it partway through their career?

00:56:10.090 --> 00:56:12.319
I think it would be
hard to really build something that wasn't

00:56:12.319 --> 00:56:14.360
there at all.

00:56:14.360 --> 00:56:18.130
I think there are far more examples of people
who haven't

00:56:18.130 --> 00:56:20.920
really learned to cope with failure well,
and when

00:56:20.920 --> 00:56:23.030
something goes off course for them, they just
have a hard

00:56:23.030 --> 00:56:24.030
time regrouping.

00:56:24.030 --> 00:56:27.340
I mean a lot of the long-term
unemployed now are people who got settled

00:56:27.340 --> 00:56:31.760
into a career, felt they did well, their
industry went south, and they can't figure

00:56:31.760 --> 00:56:33.700
out how to
reinvent themselves.

00:56:33.700 --> 00:56:34.700
And it's hard.

00:56:34.700 --> 00:56:36.900
The first year will
not be better than the old system was.

00:56:36.900 --> 00:56:41.460
It may take two
or three years to hit that breakeven point.

00:56:41.460 --> 00:56:43.500
Some people
just have that ability to bounce back.

00:56:43.500 --> 00:56:46.720
I think that
would be a hard skill to train.

00:56:46.720 --> 00:56:49.369
I would think that would be more innate but
again, I'll defer to

00:56:49.369 --> 00:56:51.259
the experts if they have other findings.

00:56:51.259 --> 00:56:55.930
&gt;&gt; Todd: All right I want to thank George
for coming in.

00:56:55.930 --> 00:56:57.970
Kind
of leave you guys with a challenge that's

00:56:57.970 --> 00:56:58.970
there.

00:56:58.970 --> 00:57:00.770
As you
can see from the questions there's a lot of

00:57:00.770 --> 00:57:02.130
appetite for
trying crazy things.

00:57:02.130 --> 00:57:03.829
That's what Google is known for.

00:57:03.829 --> 00:57:07.569
But then we don't want to become the giant,
boring

00:57:07.569 --> 00:57:11.850
bureaucratic process that we're worried about.

00:57:11.850 --> 00:57:13.859
So, take a
look at some of the ideas you've heard today.

00:57:13.859 --> 00:57:16.650
Take a look at, we have some
books for sale.

00:57:16.650 --> 00:57:19.780
Find what I'll sort of say is a 1% project,
right?

00:57:19.780 --> 00:57:23.220
Find something that we can tweak 1%
of the hiring here.

00:57:23.220 --> 00:57:24.220
Experiment a little bit.

00:57:24.220 --> 00:57:25.420
Try something crazy.

00:57:25.420 --> 00:57:28.849
Break something and see if
something interesting and cool comes out of

00:57:28.849 --> 00:57:29.849
it.

00:57:29.849 --> 00:57:32.990
So I got my biggest thing reading through
the book is if I

00:57:32.990 --> 00:57:35.750
was allowed to break 1% of hiring there's
10

00:57:35.750 --> 00:57:37.370
interesting ideas in here to do it.

00:57:37.370 --> 00:57:39.579
So if you're interested in that, come check
out the

00:57:39.579 --> 00:57:40.579
book.

00:57:40.579 --> 00:57:41.579
Come talk to me.

00:57:41.579 --> 00:57:42.859
I'm happy to help you guys break our hiring
a little

00:57:42.859 --> 00:57:44.059
bit.

00:57:44.059 --> 00:57:46.260
Hopefully the lawyers aren't watching this
right

00:57:46.260 --> 00:57:47.260
now.

00:57:47.260 --> 00:57:51.240
[laughter] Hopefully it just gets your mind
thinkin' of new ways to do hiring for Google.

00:57:51.240 --> 00:57:52.240
So thanks again George.

00:57:52.240 --> 00:57:53.240
&gt;&gt;George: Thanks so much.

00:57:53.240 --> 00:57:54.240
Really enjoyed it.

00:57:54.240 --> 00:57:54.241
[Applause]
