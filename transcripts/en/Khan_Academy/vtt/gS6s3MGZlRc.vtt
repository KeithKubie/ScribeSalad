00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:02.140
Alyssa is playing a video game.

00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:04.140
Her character is on
a quest to vanquish

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.380
an evil sorcerer and his
minions from the land.

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:09.850
Her character is a
wizard whose spells

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:12.310
have a range of 6 meters.

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:14.330
The locations of
objects in the game

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:17.850
are stored by the computer in
terms of x and y-coordinates.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.090
So 5 comma 4 is the
location of Alyssa's wizard.

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.980
8 comma 7 is the location of
Minion A. 2 comma negative 1

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.090
is the location of
Minion B. 9 comma 0

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:30.884
is the location of Minion C.

00:00:30.884 --> 00:00:33.300
So what I want to do-- and I
want you to pause this video.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.310
And I want you to think about,
given that her wizard has

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:39.270
a range of 6 meters,
which of these minions

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.169
can the wizard actually reach?

00:00:42.169 --> 00:00:43.710
I'm assuming you're
given a go at it.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.367
And we just have to
remind ourselves,

00:00:45.367 --> 00:00:47.450
to figure out which of
these minions are in reach,

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:49.241
we have to say, well,
which of these points

00:00:49.241 --> 00:00:50.380
are within 6 units?

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:53.290
We're assuming that these units
are in meters right over here.

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:57.979
Which of these points are
within 6 units of 5 comma 4?

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:59.520
And to think about
that, we just have

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.353
to calculate the distance
between this point

00:01:01.353 --> 00:01:03.990
and this point, that point
and that point, that point

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:07.220
and that point, and see if
they are greater than or less

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.730
than 6 meters.

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:12.810
And how do we calculate a
distance between two points?

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.190
Well if this is some point right
over here-- that's x1 comma y1.

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:24.690
And then this is another point
right over here, x2 comma y2.

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.724
And we want to calculate this
distance right over here.

00:01:28.724 --> 00:01:31.140
The distance formula comes
straight out of the Pythagorean

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.150
theorem.

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.910
The Pythagorean
theorem tells us,

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:38.224
if this side right over
here is our change in y--

00:01:38.224 --> 00:01:39.640
and let's actually
just write that

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.220
as the absolute value
of our change in y--

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.910
and let's say that this
side right over here

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:49.720
is the absolute value
of our change in x,

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.010
the Pythagorean theorem tells us
that this one, the hypotenuse,

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:57.370
is going to be the square
root of the sum of the squares

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:03.465
of the two sides-- so change
in x squared plus change in y

00:02:03.465 --> 00:02:03.965
squared.

00:02:06.197 --> 00:02:08.530
You might say, hey, what
happened to the absolute value?

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.863
Well when I square it, it's
going to be positive anyway.

00:02:10.863 --> 00:02:13.230
So I don't have to write
down the absolute value.

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.060
So really I just
need to figure out,

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.370
between each of these
two points, what

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:18.810
is the change in x?

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.320
What's the change in y?

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:24.310
Square them, add them together,
and then take the square root.

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:33.650
So for example, if I
were to call this P1,

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.250
if I were to call
this P2, maybe we

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.480
call this P3-- I want to do
them in different colors,

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.610
so you can keep track
of what I'm doing.

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.950
This is P3, and
let's say this is P4.

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:53.410
So let's first think about the
distance between P1 and P2.

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.400
Well, that's going to be
equal to the square root

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.760
of our change in x squared.

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.860
So our change in x is 3.

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.870
That squared is 9, plus
our change in y squared.

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.940
Our change in y is also 3.

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.680
That squared is 9.

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.690
So this is going to be
square root of 18, which

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.440
is the same thing as
3 square roots of 2.

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:26.580
Now is this more or less than 6?

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.370
Well 3 times 2 is equal to 6.

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.190
Square root of 2 is less than 2.

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.200
It's 1 point something.

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:38.290
So this right over here is
going to be less than 6.

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.460
So P2 is in range.

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:45.340
Alissa's wizard can get Minion
A. Minion A, she can attack.

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:54.070
Now think about Minion B. So
the distance between P1 and P3

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:58.150
is going to be equal to
the square root of-- so

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.060
your change in x,
it's negative 3.

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.340
Negative 3 squared
is positive 9.

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:10.790
Our change in y, to go from 4
to negative 1, it's negative 5.

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:15.380
That squared is
25-- so 9 plus 25,

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:20.829
which is equal to the
square root of 34.

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:23.590
Now is this greater
than or equal to 6?

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:27.360
Well, the square
root of 36 is 6.

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.990
So this is the square
root of a lower number.

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:33.400
So this is going to be
less than 6 as well.

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.617
So Minion B is also in reach.

00:04:37.617 --> 00:04:39.200
Now let's think about
this last point.

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:47.580
The distance
between P1 and P4 is

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:52.310
going to be equal to the
square root of our change

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:54.560
in x squared-- the
change in x is 4,

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.020
squared is 16-- plus
our change in y squared.

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.460
Our change in y is negative 4.

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:03.080
But you square that,
and you get another 16.

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.290
So this is going to
be square root of 32,

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:10.000
which actually we could just
leave it as square root of 32.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.830
Square root of 32
is clearly less

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:14.710
than the square root
of 36, which is 6.

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:17.180
So this is also going
to be less than 6.

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:21.330
So she can get at
all of the Minions.

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:24.230
They're all within
6 units of her.

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:26.330
Now which of these
is the furthest away?

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.139
Well actually, if we
were to write this--

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:29.930
we simplified this,
but we could write this

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:32.870
as the square root of 18.

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:34.934
Square root of 18 is
clearly the smallest out

00:05:34.934 --> 00:05:36.600
of square root of 18,
square root of 32,

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:37.930
and square root of 34.

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:42.290
So Minion A is the closest.

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:48.290
And Minion B, square root
of 34, is the farthest.
