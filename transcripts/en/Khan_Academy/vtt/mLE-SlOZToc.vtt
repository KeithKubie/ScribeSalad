00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:03.600
Let's do a couple of exercises
from our probability one

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:04.200
module.

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.630
So we have a bag with 9 red
marbles, 2 blue marbles,

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:10.880
and 3 green marbles in it.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.490
What is the probability
of randomly selecting

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.350
a non-blue marble
from of the bag?

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:20.080
So let's draw this bag here.

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.080
So that's my bag,
and we're going

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.730
to assume that it's a
transparent bag, so it looks

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:26.110
like a vase.

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:31.020
But we have 9 red marbles,
so let me draw 9 red marbles.

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:39.180
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
7, 8, 9 red marbles.

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.720
They're kind of orange-ish,
but it does the job.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.910
2 blue marbles, so we have 1
blue marble, 2 blue marbles.

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:53.930
And then we have 3 green
marbles, let me draw those

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.310
3, so 1, 2, 3.

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:59.240
What is the probability
of randomly selecting

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:00.870
a non-blue marble from the bag?

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.640
So maybe we mix them all up,
and we have an equal probability

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.069
of selecting any one of these.

00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:06.720
And the way you
just think about it

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.560
is what fraction of all
of the possible events

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:10.900
meet our constraint?

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.730
So let's just think about all
of the possible events first.

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:16.806
How many different possible
marbles can we take out?

00:01:16.806 --> 00:01:19.097
Well that's just the total
number of marbles there are.

00:01:19.097 --> 00:01:23.744
So are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13,

00:01:23.744 --> 00:01:26.500
14 possible marbles.

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.240
So this is the number
of possibilities.

00:01:34.457 --> 00:01:36.290
And then we just have
to think what fraction

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.670
of those possibilities
meet our constraints.

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.420
And the other way you
could have gotten 14

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.340
is just taking 9 plus 2 plus 3.

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.780
So what number of
those possibilities

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:45.950
meet our constraints?

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:51.150
And remember, our constraint
is selecting a non-blue marble

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:51.930
from the bag.

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.390
Another way to think about
it is a red or green marble,

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.567
because the only
other two colors

00:01:57.567 --> 00:01:58.650
we have are red and green.

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.454
So how many non-blue
marbles are there?

00:02:00.454 --> 00:02:02.370
Well, there's a couple
ways to think about it.

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:04.510
You could say there's
14 total marbles.

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:06.070
2 are blue.

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.070
So there are going
to be 14 minus 2,

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:12.890
which is 12 non-blue marbles.

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.280
Or you could just count them.

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.820
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.655
So there are 12
non-blue marbles.

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:30.350
So these are the possibilities
that meet our constraints

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.450
over all of the possibilities.

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.500
And then if we want to--
this isn't in simplified form

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.980
right here, since both 12
and 14 are divisible by 2.

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.820
So let's divide both the
numerator and the denominator

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:46.630
by 2, and you get 6 over 7.

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:51.710
So we have a 6/7 chance of
selecting a non-blue marble

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:53.190
from the bag.

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.660
Let's do another one.

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.470
If a number is randomly chosen
from the following list,

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.250
what is the probability that
the number is a multiple of 5?

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.640
So once again, we want
to find the fraction

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.370
of the total possibilities
that meet our constraint,

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.170
and our constraint is
being a multiple of 5.

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:14.950
So how many total
possibilities are there?

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:15.908
Let's think about that.

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:23.390
How many do we have?

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:25.270
Well that's just
the total number

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:31.226
of numbers we have to pick from,
so 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,

00:03:31.226 --> 00:03:33.140
10, 11, 12.

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:34.800
So there are 12 possibilities.

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.200
We have an equal chance of
picking any one of these 12.

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.860
Now which of these 12
are a multiple of 5?

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.710
So let's do this in
a different color.

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:47.530
So let me pick out
the multiples of 5.

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:50.190
32 is not a multiple of 5,
49 is not a multiple of 5.

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.930
55 is a multiple of 5.

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:54.680
Really, we're just
looking for the numbers

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.560
that in the ones place you
either have a 5 or a 0.

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.420
55 is a multiple of
5, 30 is a multiple

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:03.220
of 5, that's 6 times 5.

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.090
55 is 11 times 5.

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.300
Not 56, not 28.

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:13.980
This is clearly 5 times
10, this is 8 times 5,

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.230
this is the same number
again, also 8 times 5.

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:17.703
So all of these
are multiples of 5.

00:04:17.703 --> 00:04:20.019
45, that's 9 times 5.

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:21.792
3 is not a multiple of 5.

00:04:21.792 --> 00:04:23.480
25, clearly 5 times 5.

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:26.040
So I've circled all
the multiples of 5.

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.640
So of all the
possibilities, the ones that

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:31.070
meet our constraint of
being a multiple of 5,

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:37.340
there are 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 7 possibilities.

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:39.585
So 7 meet our constraint.

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:48.350
So in this example,
the probability

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:52.750
of a selecting a number that
is a multiple of 5 is 7/12.

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:54.430
Let's do another one.

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:00.130
the circumference of
a circle is 36 pi.

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:02.320
Let's draw this circle.

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:05.390
The circumference of
a circle is 36 pi,

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:07.970
so let's say the
circle looks-- I

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:10.080
can draw a neater
circle than that.

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.196
So let's say the circle
looks something like that.

00:05:12.196 --> 00:05:14.070
And its circumference--
we have to be careful

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:18.330
here, they're giving
us interesting--

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:23.580
the circumference is 36 pi.

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:26.540
Then they tell us that
contained in that circle

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:30.010
is a smaller circle
with area 16 pi.

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:33.190
So inside the bigger circle,
we have a smaller circle

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:38.430
that has an area of 16 pi.

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:42.225
A point is selected at random
from inside the larger circle,

00:05:42.225 --> 00:05:43.600
so we're going to
randomly select

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:46.040
some point in this
larger circle.

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:48.720
What is the probability
that the point also

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:51.452
lies in this smaller circle?

00:05:51.452 --> 00:05:52.910
So here's a little
bit interesting,

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:55.160
because you actually have
an infinite number of points

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:59.200
in both of these
circles, because it's not

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:02.211
kind of a separate
balls or marbles,

00:06:02.211 --> 00:06:04.460
like we saw in the first
example, or separate numbers.

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:06.370
There's actually
an infinite number

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:07.730
of points you could pick here.

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:09.479
And so, when we talk
about the probability

00:06:09.479 --> 00:06:12.100
that the point also lies
in the smaller circle,

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:14.970
we're really thinking about
the percentage of the points

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:18.320
in the larger circle that are
also in the smaller circle.

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:23.210
Or another way to think
about it is the probability

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:25.390
that if we pick a point
from this larger circle,

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:28.060
the probably that it's
also in the smaller circle

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:30.780
is really just going to be
the percentage of the larger

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:32.520
circle that is the
smaller circle.

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:34.050
I know that might
sound confusing,

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:35.050
but we're really just
have to figure out

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:37.299
the areas for both of them,
and it's really just going

00:06:37.299 --> 00:06:39.500
to be the ratios so
let's think about that.

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:43.750
So there's a temptation to
just use this 36 pi up here,

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:46.330
but we have to remember,
this was the circumference,

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:49.100
and we need to figure out the
area of both of these circles.

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:51.240
And so for area, we
need to know the radius,

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:53.550
because area is pi r squared.

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:55.220
So we can figure
out the radius from

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:57.680
the circumference by saying,
well, circumference is equal

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:01.490
to 2 times pi times the
radius of the circle.

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:04.990
Or if you say 36 pi, which we
were told is the circumference,

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:08.370
is equal to 2 times
pi times the radius,

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:14.690
we can divide both sides by 2
pi, and on the left hand side,

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:18.800
36 divided by 2 is 18
the pi's cancel out,

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:22.570
we get our radius as being equal
to 18 for this larger circle.

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:28.540
So if we want to know
its area, its area

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:31.810
is going to be pi
r squared, which

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:36.075
is equal to pi times 18 squared.

00:07:36.075 --> 00:07:38.360
And let's figure out
what 18 squared is.

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:44.140
18 times 18, 8 times
8 is 64, eight times 1

00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:49.190
is 8 plus 6 is 14,
and then we put

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:52.430
that 0 there because we're now
in the tens place, 1 times 8

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:56.130
is 8, 1 times 1 is 1.

00:07:56.130 --> 00:07:57.890
And really, this is
a 10 times the 10,

00:07:57.890 --> 00:07:59.860
and that's why it gives us 100.

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:05.580
Anyway, 4 plus 0 is a
4, 4 plus 8 is a 12,

00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:09.470
and then 1 plus 1 plus
1 is a 3, so it's 324.

00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:14.910
So the area here is
equal to pi times 324,

00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:18.420
or we could say 324 pi.

00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:21.870
So the area of the entire
larger circle, the part

00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:23.830
that I shaded in
yellow, including

00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:25.800
what's kind of under
this orange circle,

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:29.090
if you want to view it that
way, this area right over here

00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:33.230
is equal to 324 pi.

00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:38.289
So the probability that a point
that we select from this larger

00:08:38.289 --> 00:08:40.530
circle is also in
the smaller circle

00:08:40.530 --> 00:08:42.669
is really just a
percentage of the larger

00:08:42.669 --> 00:08:44.840
circle that is the
smaller circle.

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:47.140
So our probability--
I'll just write it

00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:51.940
like this-- the probability
that the point also

00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:54.146
lies in the smaller circle--
so all of that stuff

00:08:54.146 --> 00:08:54.770
I'll put in it.

00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:56.810
The probability of
that is going to be

00:08:56.810 --> 00:08:59.840
equal to the percentage
of this larger circle that

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:02.197
is this smaller one,
and that's going to be--

00:09:02.197 --> 00:09:04.530
or we could say the fraction
of the larger circle's area

00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:06.620
that is the smaller
circle's area.

00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:11.990
So it's going to be
16 pi over 324 pi.

00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:19.760
And the pi's cancel out, and
it looks like both of them

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:21.360
are divisible by 4.

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:24.000
If we divide the
numerator by 4, we get 4,

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.220
if we divide the denominator
by 4, what do we get?

00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:31.250
4 goes into 320 80 times,
it goes into 4 once,

00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:32.900
so we get an 81.

00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:35.450
So a probability--
I didn't even draw

00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:37.910
this to scale, this area is
actually much smaller when you

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:42.127
do it to scale-- the probability
that if you were to randomly

00:09:42.127 --> 00:09:43.710
select a point from
the larger circle,

00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:45.750
that it also lies
in the smaller one

00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:48.400
is the ratio of their areas,
the ratio of the smaller

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:50.130
circle to the larger one.

00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:56.080
And that is 4/81, I guess
is the best way to say it.
