00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.080
So, a botnet is different than isolated pieces of malware

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.960
in the fact that a botnet is a collection of infected machines

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.060
which are coordinated

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:13.040
through command and control by a central server,

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.160
which is called a "command and control server", or,

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:16.520
the C&amp;C server.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.840
So the power of botnets is basically

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.040
in the amount of distributed
computation and storage power

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.260
that is available to a C&amp;C server.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
[Offscreen voice] It's short for robot, is it then, I'm guessing?

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.280
Yeah, so the "bot" is basically for

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.080
machines that can operate in an automated fashion,

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.080
which refers to the robot,

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.860
the thing that you mentioned.

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.060
[Offscreen voice] Okay, and a botnet is a collection of these

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:41.960
that somebody's using for

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.360
nefarious purposes; would that be right?

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.020
[Offscreen voice] Or does it have to be?

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.320
Yeah, usually it is for nefarious purposes,

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.080
so, the main two strengths of a botnet,

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.960
from the point of view of a bad guy,

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.320
is:  One, that there is, um, they are, like,

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.820
bots on the order of hundreds and thousands of machines;

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.980
so, there is a lot of distributed computing and storage power available there.

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.520
And the other one is a certain delegation of responsibility or deniability,

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.320
which the infrastructure affords
to the person who runs the botnet,

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.120
in terms of, that the person conducts
all these nefarious activities

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:16.500
from the platform of the bots,

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.500
and not just directly.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.500
Usually people are not aware;

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:21.740
and, basically,

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.900
stealth and botnets usually go hand in hand,

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.600
because, from the point of view of the C&amp;C server,

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.500
it wants to ensure that the bots remain infected

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.600
and available, and

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.740
stay that way for the longest period of time possible.

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.640
So, if the user is aware that,

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.640
you know, it has been infected, then you

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.000
typically, they would probably

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.940
reinstall the operating system

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.080
or take other measures to clean the machine,

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.080
which doesn't work in the favor of the

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.560
botnet controller.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.560
[Offscreen voice] I'm assuming this starts from people opening

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.860
dodgy emails, or something.  Is that the sort of thing

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.560
that starts this off

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.220
for an innocent user sitting there

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.100
using their computer?

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.100
So, every botnet has a propagation mechanism;

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.200
and, nothing stopping it from using
multiple propogation vectors.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.200
So, for example, a botnet

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.200
can spread itself in passive ways,

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.200
or in active ways.  So, active ways

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.160
usually involve little or no user intervention;

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.680
basically no user intervention

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.800
in the sense that, if a machine

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.800
has been infected, then

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.800
the bot binary has inherent mechanisms

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.420
to find other hosts on the internet to infect.

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.420
For example, by scanning for hosts

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.160
that have known vulnerabilities that can be exploited.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.400
And then, there are passive mechanisms

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.400
that use -- that require some degree

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.900
of user intervention.

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.660
For example, drive-by downloads,

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.060
which are websites

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.480
that have, say, some active content

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.480
like JavaScript, or ActiveX controls.

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.680
So just a user,

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.880
when he or she visits the website,

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:51.840
the installation of the malware

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.560
takes place in an automated fashion.

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.060
[Offscreen voice] So, just because they visited that website,

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.160
the website might be doing something that they think,

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.000
Oh look, Flash, active

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.480
this, that, or the other, and

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.700
fancy graphics.  But in the background,

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.860
it could be doing something much more serious.

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.140
Yeah, and um,

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.280
there are other passive ways, also.

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.320
I mean, social engineering is a very powerful way

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.580
of spreading malware in general, especially botnets,

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.580
which involves some kind of

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.580
human interaction to convince

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.180
a user to take steps that

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.780
they would otherwise not do.

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.460
For example,

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.080
a pop-up thing

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.360
that pops up and says,

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.520
You have won the lottery.  Click on this link

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.920
to claim the money.  And you click on the link,

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.880
and it initiates the download of the malware

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.080
to your machine.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.500
And then, we also have propagation mechanisms

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.620
like, uh,

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:42.980
like media.  For example, USB sticks.

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.460
Which is potentially very powerful,

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:48.140
because it allows the infection to spread

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:49.460
to private networks

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:51.800
which are otherwise inaccessible over the internet.

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.140
I mean, usually the malicious binary

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.140
is in the form of an executable.

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:58.500
So, it just starts running, right,

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.020
like, it doesn't need you to double-click it.

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:03.020
[Offscreen voice] Where does the command machine come in?

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:05.720
[Offscreen voice] You know, is that being controlled by someone,

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.080
or is that itself a bot?

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:09.940
So, I think we can make use

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:11.940
of some diagrams here.
[Offscreen voice] Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:13.940
Okay, so here is the C&amp;C server here.

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:16.560
And, here is the user.

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:17.940
The innocent user.

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.940
Say that, through whatever propagation vector,

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.820
either through clicking on some bad links,

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:25.460
or through some infected media,

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.380
the user installs the malicious software.

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.380
If it's associated with a botnet,

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:32.380
usually it's called a "bot binary".

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:34.380
Binary means the executable code which

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.280
can be directly run by the machine
without the need to be compiled.

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:39.280
By installing the bot binary,

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:40.140
the user

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.140
has got the infection, but

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:43.940
it is not formally part of the botnet now.

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:45.620
It needs to find some way

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.300
to locate the C&amp;C server

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:50.180
to be able to exchange messages with it.

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.020
So, it needs some rallying mechanism.

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.900
Now, the rallying mechanism can take place

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:57.580
in the form of an IP address.

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.580
That is, the IP address can be hard-coded

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:01.920
into the bot binary.  Or the user

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:04.520
can obtain a seed list of IP addresses,

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.520
which would be basically IP addresses of

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.520
some other hosts which know

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.260
how to locate the C&amp;C server.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.260
So basically, like stepping stones between

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.260
the C&amp;C server and the user

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:15.860
to locate the C&amp;C server.

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:17.860
Apart from IP address, the user could

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:19.860
also potentially use some domain name

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:21.860
related to the C&amp;C server, and

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:23.860
the domain name could likewise be hard-coded

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:25.860
into the bot binary; or the user can

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:27.860
make use of some algorithm,

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:29.480
which is known to the user,

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:31.840
and to the C&amp;C server to generate

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.080
predictable domain names

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:35.200
which are then associated with the C&amp;C server.

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:37.420
Either way, once the user finds out

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:39.820
how to communicate with the C&amp;C server,

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:42.720
it connects to it.

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:45.560
Now the user is formally part of the botnet,

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:47.560
and it has kind of registered itself

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:48.920
with the botnet.

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:51.900
So typically, the C&amp;C server wants the bots

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:53.900
to carry out certain nefarious activities

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:56.000
on its behalf.  It is able to access

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:57.280
that particular bot.

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.400
Now, the purposes for which these bots can be used

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.040
are different.

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:02.580
For example,

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:05.300
the bots can be used for the
purpose of information gathering,

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:07.300
which involves, uh,

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:09.900
sensitive information like passwords,

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:11.460
credit card information,

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:13.980
or information that is not of a financial nature

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:15.980
but's still valuable, for example,

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:17.600
intellectual property.

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.220
The other purpose for which the botnet

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:21.280
can use its bots is

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:22.920
for distributed computing.

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:25.100
For example, distributed password cracking,

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:27.100
getting bots to solve CAPTCHAs,

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:29.100
basically, anything that requires

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:31.500
proof of work, and is infeasible

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:34.200
for, um, for the botmaster,

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:36.200
the person who controls the botnet,

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:37.720
to carry out individually.

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:39.720
It can distribute it across

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.720
the recruited bots

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:43.860
and get them to do it on its behalf.

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:46.380
[Offscreen voice] The C&amp;C machine is obviously

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:49.140
under the control of the -- whoever the botmaster is.

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:50.060
Yeah.

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:52.060
[Offscreen voice] Um, is that there usually their own computer,

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:54.300
or is that again remote from them?

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:56.300
[Offscreen voice] So is there -- I was wondering if there was a way

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:57.740
of tracing them?

00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:59.620
Yes.  So --

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:01.860
It would be very naive of a botmaster to directly

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:04.460
use its own machine for the C&amp;C purposes.

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:06.880
And, usually, how it

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:08.400
evades detection

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:10.720
is to incorporate

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:12.820
several stepping stones between itself

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:14.740
and the machine.

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:17.020
And, for example,

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:19.420
it could login to that machine

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:21.660
or access that machine using the TOR network.

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:25.540
So that way, it is using that machine anonymously

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:29.020
and remove all traces of its identity,

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:31.400
and basically be untraceable.

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:34.100
[Offscreen voice] How many botnets are actually operating on the internet at the moment?

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:36.100
[Offscreen voice] Is there -- can anyone hazard a guess

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:38.100
at those numbers, or --

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:40.660
It's hard to say, because

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:42.660
um, I mean, how can you count

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:44.660
the number of bots that are controlled, right?

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:46.660
Like, if it's a centralized

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:48.660
botnet, and there is, say,

00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:50.660
one, or like a limited number

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:53.000
of C&amp;C servers -- In one specific case,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.740
they looked at all the

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:56.900
incoming connections to the C&amp;C server,

00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:58.900
which kind of helped them estimate

00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:01.160
the footprint of the botnet, which is the number of bots

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:03.300
that formed part of the botnet.

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:05.700
But, who knows if there are other C&amp;C servers

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:07.100
related to the same botnet?

00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:09.280
Because, you know, like, looking from the vantage point

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:11.680
of one C&amp;C server would afford you visibility

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:14.060
into only its own footprint.

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:16.880
So, there have been academic

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:18.880
studies on estimates of

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:20.760
botnet footprints.

00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:22.760
Um, but one cannot really

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:24.760
be completely accurate about that.

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:27.040
[Offscreen voice] Is there any way that that kind of technology can be

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:30.140
used for good?  Or, is it always for nefarious reasons?  [Laughing]

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:32.120
Well, uh --

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:34.420
It's kind of being used for the good,

00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:37.100
in the context of censorship resistance systems,

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:39.920
where good users are trying to access

00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:42.300
some content which has been banned in their country,

00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:44.540
using more or less the same evasive measures

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:46.100
which are used by botnets

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:48.880
or malware to evade security people.

00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:51.600
So, it's the same model, turned upside-down.

00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:57.500
By subtracting these frames from each other,

00:08:57.640 --> 00:08:59.640
we can virtually shroud
[camera shutter sounds]

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.640
the influence of daylight.

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:03.360
So, we can even eliminate

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:04.900
cast shadows...
