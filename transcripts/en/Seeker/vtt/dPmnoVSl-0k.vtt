00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:03.820
[? SPEAKER: ?] What does
human flesh taste like?

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:06.050
Well, based on the
testimonies of some convicted

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:10.250
modern-day cannibals,
we have a small idea.

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:11.870
Some of these
man-eaters have compared

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:16.640
the taste and texture to pork,
or veal, or even chicken.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.250
Now we might not all agree on
what human flesh tastes like,

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:21.380
but one researcher wanted
to at least find out

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.600
if we have any
nutritional value.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.930
By examining bite and stone
tool marks on ancient bones,

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:29.510
archeologists have determined
that some of our ancestors

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:31.430
were cannibalistic at times.

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:33.620
We don't really know how
prevalent cannibalism was

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:35.574
or why some might
have practiced it,

00:00:35.574 --> 00:00:37.490
but the new study has
shown that those who did

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:40.580
eat people probably weren't
doing it for sustenance.

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.530
Because it turns
out, eating human

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:43.970
isn't that good
for you, at least

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:45.760
compared to other food options.

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.660
To get to this conclusion,
one archaeologist

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.430
looked to previous
studies at the protein

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.530
and fat content
of four adult men

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.570
plus the weight of body
parts to calculate out

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.130
our caloric value.

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:57.290
This new calculation
found that the modern man

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:03.080
may have a nutritional value
of about 143,771 calories.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.450
He also broke it down
further by body part

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:07.760
with adipose
tissue, or body fat,

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.680
with the highest
number of calories,

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.452
and the teeth with the lowest.

00:01:11.452 --> 00:01:13.580
But remember, this is
taking weight into account.

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.205
So you would actually
get more calories

00:01:15.205 --> 00:01:17.180
by eating a kilogram
of teeth than you would

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.230
a kilogram of lungs or spleen.

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:21.230
Now one note to make is,
these numbers are based

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:23.720
of modern man and
not ancient man

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.870
and are specific to adult
males, not women or children.

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:29.146
So obviously, it's not
the complete picture.

00:01:29.146 --> 00:01:30.770
But based on these
numbers, it wouldn't

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.600
be a smart choice
as an early human

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.700
to try to live off of humans.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.410
Looking at muscle
tissues, animals

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:39.350
around at the time like
mammoths, woolly rhinos,

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.390
red deer, bears, horses,
boars, reindeer, and even ibex

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.600
would offer more calories
than another early human man.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.180
So then, why did
they eat each other?

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.067
Well, some think it was a
wartime or religious ritual.

00:01:53.067 --> 00:01:54.650
It may have been
opportunistic, easier

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:57.470
to eat someone who died your
group than to go out and hunt.

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.240
But according to
this study, it sounds

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.720
like early cannibalism was
more cultural and social

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:02.720
than it was nutritional.

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.470
