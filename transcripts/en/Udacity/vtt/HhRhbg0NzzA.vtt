00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.318
y will be greater than or equal to 7. We know that the smallest value x can take

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:08.683
on will be zero, since that's the fewest number of glasses wipers Grant can put

00:00:08.695 --> 00:00:12.915
in his suitcase. And if he does pack that minimum number, and we plug zero in

00:00:12.927 --> 00:00:17.050
for x right here, this term will equal zero, and y will just equal 7. Every

00:00:17.062 --> 00:00:21.490
other number that we could plug in for x would be greater than 0, so y would be

00:00:21.502 --> 00:00:22.297
greater than 7.
