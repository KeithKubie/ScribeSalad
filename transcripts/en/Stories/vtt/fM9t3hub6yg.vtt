[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:01.251 --> 00:00:02.840
SPEAKER: The danger
of smoking tobacco

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:05.690
is common knowledge in countries
like the United States,

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:08.410
which is one of the main reasons
why the tobacco industry is

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:10.640
so heavily regulated there.

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:14.220
But in Indonesia, the industry
has very few restrictions,

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:16.570
so it's hardly a surprise
that the Indonesian tobacco

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.380
industry is worth $100 billion.

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.805
But what might
surprise you is this.

00:00:23.805 --> 00:00:26.650
This image is part of a
photo series highlighting

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:30.000
some of the consequences that
Indonesia's unregulated tobacco

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.560
industry has had
on the population.

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:35.820
MICHELLE SIU: Hi, my
name is Michelle Siu.

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.250
And I'm a Canadian documentary
photographer and freelance

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.720
photojournalist.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.890
The photos were
taken in Indonesia

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.970
in the capital city of Jakarta.

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:49.550
The children I photographed
were as young as four

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:50.825
to their early teens.

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:55.930
These aren't boys that
are casual smokers.

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:59.150
These are children who are
addicted, who smoke regularly,

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:01.769
and who throw temper
tantrums or fits

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:04.019
if they don't get their fix
and if their parents don't

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.810
give them money for
them to buy cigarettes.

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:13.230
SPEAKER: While there are only
a relatively small number

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:16.560
of children that actually smoke,
without government regulation

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.746
and measures to educate
and protect kids,

00:01:18.746 --> 00:01:20.370
there is very little
being done to stop

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.351
the problem from getting worse.

00:01:23.351 --> 00:01:25.850
MICHELLE SIU: I was compelled
to photograph children smoking

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.970
in Indonesia, because
as many of us know,

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.520
smoking rates are declining
in wealthy countries,

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.140
such as Canada and the US.

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.730
And as a result, big
tobacco companies

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.220
are targeting countries
like Indonesia

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.854
that have very lax regulations.

00:01:41.854 --> 00:01:43.270
SPEAKER: For the
last few decades,

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.160
tobacco companies
have taken advantage

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.650
of these lax regulations and the
virtually nonexistent taxation

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.960
on tobacco, with the industry
spending hundreds of millions

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.860
of dollars on billboard
and television advertising,

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.830
often aimed at the youth market.

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.165
And targeting Indonesia
is paying off massively

00:01:59.165 --> 00:02:01.190
for big tobacco companies.

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.780
Two-thirds of Indonesian men
of smokers, almost all of whom

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.465
took up the habit
before they were 19.

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:12.920
MICHELLE SIU:
Children start smoking

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.870
early in life in
Indonesia, quite simply

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.680
because it's everywhere.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.010
Advertisements are everywhere.

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.650
And branding is everywhere,
especially where kids are.

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.290
And the cigarettes also can
be bought and sold easily

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:25.872
without identification.

00:02:25.872 --> 00:02:27.330
SPEAKER: Taking a
step back to look

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.580
at the scale of the
problem, 60 million people

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:31.910
smoke in Indonesia.

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.570
That's about a quarter
of the population.

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:36.460
And according to the
World Lung Foundation,

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:40.430
around half that number will die
from smoking-related illnesses.

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.460
With so many lives on the
line, the Indonesian government

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:45.840
has been heavily criticized
for not doing more

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.840
to stop tobacco's firm
hold on the nation.

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.350
Yes, tobacco taxes
have been increased.

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:54.100
And there is a proposal
to ban advertising.

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.190
But tobacco companies have
a trick up their sleeve

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.780
to avoid all this, kreteks,
clove-laced cigarettes used

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.340
by around 80% to 90% of
smokers in Indonesia.

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.400
Kreteks are an
Indonesian invention,

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.400
created during the 19th
century as a cure for asthma,

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.380
of all things.

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.230
Given their
popularity in history,

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.310
tobacco companies are
now pushing the idea

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.050
that kreteks are a part of
Indonesia's cultural heritage,

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:19.660
putting pressure on the
government to protect them.

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:20.760
And it's working.

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.130
Kreteks have lower taxes
imposed on them compared

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.950
to Western style cigarettes.

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.130
And there are even
proposals to promote kretek

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.410
through festivals to celebrate
their cultural significance.

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:32.230
Tobacco's grip on
Indonesia doesn't

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.930
look like it's going
away anytime soon, which

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.470
is why Michelle was compelled
to take photos of the most

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.572
innocent victims in this fight.

00:03:40.572 --> 00:03:42.030
MICHELLE SIU: That
first experience

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.540
of seeing this little
kid smoke really provoked

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.290
that feeling of heartbreak.

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.370
And then in researching
the story further

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.320
to understand, OK, why are
these children smoking,

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:54.130
and to understand that there
is an economic and political

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:58.600
driving force behind this
addiction, that made me angry.

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.970
And that made me really want
to try and tell the story,

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.390
and to let people know
what is happening.

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:07.760
I think it's an issue that's
going to really affect

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.212
the generation to come.

00:04:11.212 --> 00:04:13.670
SPEAKER: Another issue affecting
children in the developing

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:15.380
world is child labor.

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.610
To find out more,
check out this episode.

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:19.279
Poverty is the
driving factor that

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:21.399
causes families to
send children to work

00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:24.600
in hazardous and low wage
jobs, such as brick chipping,

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.870
construction, and waste picking,
instead of attending school.

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.860
