00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:03.050
Welcome to solving a
quadratic by factoring.

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:04.970
Let's start doing
some problems.

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:13.480
So, let's say I had a function
f of x is equal to x

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:18.410
squared plus 6x plus 8.

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:23.810
Now if I were to graph f of
x, the graph is going to

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:24.790
look something like this.

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:27.810
I don't know exactly what it's
going to look like, but it's

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.420
going to be a parabola and it's
going to intersect the x-axis

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.440
at a couple of points,
here and here.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.460
And what we're going to try
to do is determine what

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.480
those two points are.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.800
So first of all, when a
function intersects the

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.220
x-axis, that means f
of x is equal to zero.

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.820
Because this is f of x-axis,
similar to the y-axis.

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.760
So here f of x is 0.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.420
So in order to solve this
equation we set f of x to 0,

00:00:52.420 --> 00:01:01.480
and we get x squared plus
6x plus 8 is equal to 0.

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.120
Now this might look like you
could solve it pretty easily,

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.060
but that x squared term messes
things up and you could

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.130
try it out for yourself.

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:10.680
So we're going to
do is factor this.

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.660
And we're going to say that x
squared plus 6x plus 8, but

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:19.240
this can be written as x plus
something times x

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.890
plus something.

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.200
It will still equal that,
except that's equal to 0.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.650
Now in this presentation, I'm
going to just show you the

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.980
systematic or you could say the
mechanical way of doing this.

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.720
I'm going to give you another
presentation on why this works.

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.420
And you might want to just
multiply out the answers we

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.140
get in and multiply out
the expressions and

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.400
see why it works.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.160
And the message we're going
to use is, we look at the

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.405
coefficient on this x term, 6.

00:01:43.405 --> 00:01:46.450
And we say what two
numbers will add up to 6.

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.840
And when those same two
numbers are multiplied

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.650
you're going to get 8.

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:53.290
Well let's just think
about the factors of 8.

00:01:53.290 --> 00:02:00.160
The factors of 8 are
one to 4 and 8.

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:05.670
well 1 times 8 is 8, but 1 plus
8 is 9, so that doesn't work.

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.610
2 times 4 is 8, and
2 plus 4 is 6.

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.040
So that works.

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:17.560
So we could just say x plus 2
and x plus 4 is equal to 0.

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.150
Now if two expressions or two
numbers times each other equals

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.470
0, that means that one of those
two numbers or both of

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:25.990
them must equal 0.

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:37.785
So now we can say that x
plus 2 equals 0, and x

00:02:37.785 --> 00:02:41.880
plus 4 is equal to zero.

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.750
Well, this is a very
simple equation.

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.680
We subtract 2 from both sides
and we get x equals negative 2.

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:53.030
And here we get x
equals minus 4.

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.020
And if we substitute
either of these into the

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.470
original equation, we'll
see that it works.

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.650
Minus 2-- so let's just try it
with minus 2 and I'll leave

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:07.060
minus 4 up to you --so minus 2
squared plus 6 times

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.940
minus 2 plus 8.

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:18.070
Minus 2 squared is 4, minus
12-- 6 times minus 2 --plus 8.

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:21.170
And sure enough that equals 0.

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.030
And if you did the same thing
with negative 4, you'd

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:24.810
also see that works.

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.600
And you might be saying,
wow, this is interesting.

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.180
This is an equation that
has two solutions.

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.040
Well, if you think about it, it
makes sense because the graph

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:39.130
of f of x is intersecting the
x-axis in two different places.

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:40.150
Let's do another problem.

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:56.580
Let's say I had f of x
is equal to 2 x squared

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:01.830
plus 20x plus 50.

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:04.170
So if we want to figure out
where it intersects the x-axis,

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.470
we just set f of x equal to 0,
and I'll just swap the left and

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.665
right sides of the equation.

00:04:09.665 --> 00:04:20.520
And I get 2x squared plus
20x plus 50 equals 0.

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:22.890
Now, what's a little different
this time from last time, is

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:25.910
here the coefficient on that x
squared is actually a 2 instead

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:28.140
of a 1, and I like
it to be a 1.

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:30.680
So let's divide the whole
equation, both the left

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.150
and right sides, by 2.

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:42.460
I get x squared plus
10x plus 25 equals 0.

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:45.786
So all I did is I multiplied
1/2 times-- this is the same

00:04:45.786 --> 00:04:48.220
thing as dividing
by 2 --times 1/2.

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:50.940
And of course 0 times 1/2 is 0.

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:52.580
Now we are ready to do what
we did before, and you

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.660
might want to pause it
and try it yourself.

00:04:54.660 --> 00:05:00.080
We're going to say x plus
something times x plus

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:05.450
something is equal to 0 and
those two somethings, they

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:08.300
should add up to 10, and
when you multiply them,

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:09.940
they should be 25.

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:11.690
Let's think about
the factors of 25.

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:16.120
You have 1, 5, and 25.

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.100
Well 1 times 25 is 25.

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:22.260
1 plus 25 is 26, not 10.

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:30.170
5 times 5 is 25, and 5 plus 5
is 10, so 5 actually works.

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:34.640
It actually turns out that
both of these numbers are 5.

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:39.690
So you get x plus 5 equals
0 or x plus 5 equals 0.

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:42.882
So you just have to
really write it once.

00:05:42.882 --> 00:05:45.590
So you get x equals negative 5.

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:47.030
So how do you think
about this graphically?

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:50.290
I just told you that these
equations can intersect the

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:53.470
x-axis in two places, but
this only has one solution.

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:54.920
Well, this solution
would look like.

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:05.080
If this is x equals negative 5,
we'd have a parabola that just

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:08.020
touches right there, and
then comes back up.

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:09.880
And instead of intersecting
in two places it only

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:13.580
intersects right there
at x equals negative 5.

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:17.110
And now as an exercise just to
prove to you that I'm not

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:24.280
teaching you incorrectly, let's
multiply x plus 5 times x plus

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:29.370
5 just to show you that it
equals what it should equal.

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:32.730
So we just say that this is the
same thing is x times x plus

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:39.950
5 plus 5 times x plus 5.

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:47.200
x squared plus 5x
plus 5x plus 25.

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:52.410
And that's x squared
plus 10x plus 25.

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:54.780
So, it equals what we
said it should equal.

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:57.320
And I'm going to once again do
another module where I explain

00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:59.870
this a little bit more.

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:03.220
Let's do one more problem.

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:04.930
And this one I am just
going to cut to the chase.

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:15.250
Let's just solve x squared
minus x minus 30 is equal to 0.

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:19.550
Once again, two numbers when we
add them they equal-- whats the

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:21.850
coefficient here,
it's negative 1.

00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:26.090
So we could say those two
numbers are a plus b equals

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:33.760
minus 1 and a times b
will equal minus 30.

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:37.050
Well let's just think about
what all the factors are of 30.

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:46.590
1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 30.

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:50.930
Well, something interesting is
happening this time though.

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:55.320
Since a times b is negative
30, one of these numbers

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:56.000
have to be negative.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.370
They both can't be negative,
because if they're both

00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:01.800
negative then this would
be a positive 30.

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:04.950
a times b is negative 30.

00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:07.620
So actually we're going to have
to say, two of these factors,

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:12.030
the difference between them
should be negative 1.

00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:13.930
Well, if we look at all of
these, all these numbers

00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:17.850
obviously when you pair them
up, they multiply out to 30.

00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:22.200
But the only ones that have a
difference of 1 is 5 and 6.

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:25.700
And since it's a negative 1,
it's going to be-- and I know

00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:27.770
I'm going very fast with this
and I'll do more example

00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:33.280
problems --this would be x
minus 6 times x plus

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:36.010
5 is equal to 0.

00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:37.850
So how did I think about that?

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:42.160
Negative 6 times 5
is negative 30.

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:46.180
Negative 6 plus 5
is negative 1.

00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:47.550
So it works out.

00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:50.000
And the more and more you do
these practices-- I know it

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.570
seems a little confusing
right now --it'll make

00:08:51.570 --> 00:08:52.900
a lot more sense.

00:08:52.900 --> 00:09:00.010
So you get x equals 6 or
x equals negative 5.

00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:04.150
I think at this point you're
ready to try some solving

00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:06.610
quadratics by factoring and
I'll do a couple more modules

00:09:06.610 --> 00:09:08.980
as soon as you get some
more practice problems.

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:10.520
Have fun.
