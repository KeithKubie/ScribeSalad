00:00:00.369 --> 00:00:01.368
Voiceover: In the last video,

00:00:01.368 --> 00:00:05.371
we were able to figure out
what vectors a plus b is

00:00:05.371 --> 00:00:09.700
when you view it from a
component point of view,

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.270
and so if we were to visualize that,

00:00:11.608 --> 00:00:12.967
that's vector a.

00:00:12.967 --> 00:00:16.701
Then let me paste vector b here.

00:00:16.701 --> 00:00:18.166
It's a little bit messy.

00:00:18.166 --> 00:00:19.700
That is vector b there.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.134
Actually, let me see if I can
clean this up a little bit.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:25.700
Let me clean this up.

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.466
I'll get the eraser tool.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.499
Let me clean this up a little bit

00:00:29.499 --> 00:00:32.071
so that we can see a little bit clearer.

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.867
The vector that we care about,

00:00:35.183 --> 00:00:37.200
almost done cleaning,

00:00:37.613 --> 00:00:38.633
the vector,

00:00:38.633 --> 00:00:39.967
I'll get rid of this too

00:00:39.967 --> 00:00:41.767
just because we just want to visualize ...

00:00:41.767 --> 00:00:43.633
well, actually, I shouldn't
get rid of that part.

00:00:43.633 --> 00:00:45.768
I'll delete this right over here.

00:00:45.768 --> 00:00:48.633
The vector that we care about, a plus b,

00:00:48.633 --> 00:00:50.500
that is this vector.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.167
That is this vector right over here.

00:00:53.167 --> 00:00:56.567
We could start at the tail
of a, go to the head of a,

00:00:56.567 --> 00:00:58.167
and then place the tail of b there,

00:00:58.167 --> 00:00:59.567
and then where the head of a is,

00:00:59.567 --> 00:01:01.833
that's going to be the head of a plus b.

00:01:01.833 --> 00:01:04.167
That's this vector right over here.

00:01:04.167 --> 00:01:07.167
We can think of its horizontal
and vertical components.

00:01:07.167 --> 00:01:10.200
Its vertical component is this vector,

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.000
is this vector right over here,

00:01:14.433 --> 00:01:17.900
and that's that vector right over there.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.600
Its horizontal component is this vector,

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.000
is this vector, which is
this one right over there.

00:01:25.166 --> 00:01:27.566
What I want to do now is figure out

00:01:27.566 --> 00:01:29.134
what is the magnitude ...

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:30.834
let's just call this vector c

00:01:30.834 --> 00:01:33.132
so I don't have to keep writing a plus b.

00:01:33.166 --> 00:01:37.267
I want to figure out what is
the magnitude of vector c,

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.633
and I want to figure out the angle.

00:01:39.633 --> 00:01:41.366
I want to figure out its direction.

00:01:41.366 --> 00:01:43.433
I want to figure out this angle.

00:01:43.433 --> 00:01:46.866
I want to figure out this
angle right over there.

00:01:47.233 --> 00:01:48.515
Let's think about it.

00:01:48.515 --> 00:01:50.402
Let's think about it step by step.

00:01:50.402 --> 00:01:51.567
The magnitude is actually maybe

00:01:51.567 --> 00:01:53.167
this most straightforward one.

00:01:53.167 --> 00:01:55.333
Let me redraw vector c here.

00:01:57.449 --> 00:01:59.233
Actually, I'll use this
space right over here.

00:01:59.725 --> 00:02:01.866
Vector c looks like this.

00:02:02.596 --> 00:02:05.667
Vector c looks like that,

00:02:05.792 --> 00:02:08.000
and it has its horizontal component.

00:02:08.761 --> 00:02:10.102
You have its horizontal component

00:02:10.102 --> 00:02:12.333
and you have its vertical component.

00:02:14.647 --> 00:02:16.033
The magnitude of it,

00:02:16.033 --> 00:02:18.300
we just know from the Pythagorean theorem,

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.100
the square of the magnitude
of the horizontal component

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.233
plus the square of the magnitude
of the vertical component,

00:02:26.233 --> 00:02:28.300
that's going to be equal to the square of

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:29.703
the magnitude of the vector.

00:02:29.703 --> 00:02:31.300
Or another way of thinking about it,

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.500
the magnitude of the vector
is going to be equal to

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.370
the square root of this business squared

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:39.900
plus this business squared,

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:40.967
and that's going to be ...

00:02:40.967 --> 00:02:42.700
actually, I'll just write
it just so that we ...

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:43.500
Well, it's getting messy,

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:44.633
so let me just get the calculator out

00:02:44.633 --> 00:02:46.666
to get a reasonable approximation.

00:02:47.363 --> 00:02:48.867
Get the calculator out.

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:52.800
It's going to be the square root.

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.669
It's going to be a little
bit of a hairy statement.

00:02:55.768 --> 00:02:57.167
It's going to be the square root of

00:02:57.167 --> 00:03:03.400
three times the square
root of three over two,

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.300
over two, so that's that,

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:11.401
minus square root of two,

00:03:11.568 --> 00:03:13.501
minus the square root of two,

00:03:13.501 --> 00:03:15.233
so it's going to be that quantity.

00:03:15.233 --> 00:03:17.100
That's what we have in
orange right over there.

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:18.633
We're going to square that,

00:03:18.633 --> 00:03:21.766
plus three over two,

00:03:21.766 --> 00:03:23.766
three divided by two,

00:03:23.766 --> 00:03:25.967
plus the square root of two,

00:03:25.967 --> 00:03:30.200
plus the square root of two,
so that quantity squared,

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.007
and we're of course taking the
square root of all of that.

00:03:33.233 --> 00:03:35.100
That's going to be equal to,

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.766
we deserve a little
bit of a drum roll now,

00:03:37.766 --> 00:03:40.000
3.14 ...

00:03:40.368 --> 00:03:42.900
it felt like it might have
been close to pi, but it's not.

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.171
Pi would be 3.1415 and I can keep going,

00:03:45.171 --> 00:03:47.567
but it's 3.145.

00:03:47.567 --> 00:03:52.000
I'll just write this approximately 3.146.

00:03:52.833 --> 00:03:53.500
Let me write this.

00:03:53.500 --> 00:04:06.666
This is approximately 3.146
is the magnitude here.

00:04:06.767 --> 00:04:07.833
That makes sense.

00:04:07.833 --> 00:04:10.834
We saw vector a right over here

00:04:10.834 --> 00:04:13.433
had a magnitude of 3,

00:04:13.433 --> 00:04:14.301
and as we can see,

00:04:14.301 --> 00:04:16.833
this one looks a little
bit longer than that,

00:04:16.833 --> 00:04:20.133
even when we look at it visually.

00:04:20.167 --> 00:04:24.142
That actually is consistent
with what we see here.

00:04:24.236 --> 00:04:26.066
Now let's think about the direction.

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:27.733
Let's call this angle ...

00:04:29.638 --> 00:04:32.134
I don't want to do it in that dark color.

00:04:32.166 --> 00:04:35.984
Let's call this angle
right over here theta.

00:04:36.497 --> 00:04:37.433
What do we know?

00:04:37.433 --> 00:04:39.034
We know that, well,

00:04:39.034 --> 00:04:42.033
we know what the length
of the opposite side is,

00:04:42.033 --> 00:04:44.767
and we know what the length
of the adjacent side is,

00:04:44.767 --> 00:04:46.434
and actually, now we know
the length of the hypotenuse,

00:04:46.434 --> 00:04:47.700
but let's just say we didn't even know

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.301
the length of the hypotenuse.

00:04:49.301 --> 00:04:51.367
If we know the opposite and the adjacent,

00:04:51.367 --> 00:04:52.566
you can use tangent.

00:04:52.566 --> 00:04:54.766
We know that the tangent of theta,

00:04:54.766 --> 00:04:56.767
tangent of theta,

00:04:56.767 --> 00:04:59.233
is going to be equal to the
length of the opposite side

00:04:59.233 --> 00:05:01.033
over the length of the hypotenuse.

00:05:01.033 --> 00:05:03.800
That would be equal to this,

00:05:04.233 --> 00:05:07.233
so copy and paste.

00:05:07.233 --> 00:05:11.433
It's going to be equal to that over this,

00:05:11.433 --> 00:05:15.033
over this right over here,

00:05:15.033 --> 00:05:17.473
so copy and paste.

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:18.634
All right.

00:05:18.634 --> 00:05:21.066
It's going to be equal to that.

00:05:22.295 --> 00:05:24.200
Let me draw a little line here.

00:05:24.567 --> 00:05:28.434
Or we could say that theta is equal to

00:05:28.434 --> 00:05:29.967
the inverse tangent,

00:05:29.967 --> 00:05:31.900
sometimes called the arc tangent,

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:36.234
the inverse tangent of
all of this business,

00:05:36.234 --> 00:05:38.666
of all of this.

00:05:39.033 --> 00:05:40.967
Let me just copy and paste,

00:05:40.967 --> 00:05:44.667
copy and paste right over there.

00:05:44.766 --> 00:05:48.867
Let's put that into our
calculator and see what we get.

00:05:50.023 --> 00:05:50.566
Let's see.

00:05:50.566 --> 00:05:54.033
We're going to take the inverse tangent,

00:05:54.033 --> 00:05:55.966
and I've already verified
that I'm in degree mode

00:05:55.966 --> 00:05:57.433
in this calculator,

00:05:57.433 --> 00:05:58.966
and we saw that over there,

00:05:58.966 --> 00:06:01.567
that it wasn't interpreting
this correctly as 30 degrees,

00:06:01.567 --> 00:06:02.433
not 30 radians,

00:06:02.433 --> 00:06:04.768
so inverse tangent of.

00:06:04.768 --> 00:06:05.666
All right.

00:06:06.033 --> 00:06:13.653
Once again, three divided by
two plus square root of two,

00:06:13.653 --> 00:06:17.433
plus the square root of two divided by,

00:06:17.433 --> 00:06:22.100
divided by this, which is three times

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:26.633
the square root of three divided by two

00:06:26.633 --> 00:06:29.633
minus the square root of two,

00:06:29.633 --> 00:06:31.300
and the order of operations
with a calculator

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:33.501
will interpret this, it should be correct,

00:06:33.501 --> 00:06:35.900
and so close the parenthesis there.

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:37.234
That closes that parenthesis,

00:06:37.234 --> 00:06:39.501
and then we have to close
that parenthesis there,

00:06:39.501 --> 00:06:42.400
and we deserve another mini drum roll.

00:06:42.433 --> 00:06:44.900
We get 67 point ...

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:48.634
Let's just say it's roughly 67.89 degrees.

00:06:48.634 --> 00:06:51.524
So theta,

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:53.771
let me write this here.

00:06:53.771 --> 00:06:58.320
Theta is approximately 67.89 degrees.

00:06:58.320 --> 00:06:59.253
Did I get that right?

00:06:59.253 --> 00:07:01.101
Yup, 67.89 degrees,

00:07:01.101 --> 00:07:02.866
and that also looks about right.

00:07:02.967 --> 00:07:04.962
If you look at this angle right over here,

00:07:05.961 --> 00:07:06.900
if we eyeball it,

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:09.901
it looks like a little
bit more than 60 degrees.

00:07:09.901 --> 00:07:11.701
Just like that, we were able to figure out

00:07:11.701 --> 00:07:15.000
the magnitude of the
sum and the direction.

00:07:15.301 --> 00:07:16.767
Now there's one thing that I think

00:07:16.767 --> 00:07:18.533
it's interesting to keep in mind.

00:07:18.566 --> 00:07:21.035
Notice that the magnitude,

00:07:21.035 --> 00:07:23.233
the magnitude of this vector

00:07:23.233 --> 00:07:25.444
is less than the sum of the magnitudes.

00:07:25.444 --> 00:07:27.435
The magnitude of vector a was three.

00:07:27.435 --> 00:07:30.966
The magnitude of vector b is two.

00:07:30.966 --> 00:07:33.033
And so three plus two
would have been five,

00:07:33.033 --> 00:07:35.433
but this has a smaller magnitude.

00:07:35.433 --> 00:07:38.833
The only way that the magnitude of a sum

00:07:38.833 --> 00:07:41.367
is going to be the same as
the sum of the magnitudes

00:07:41.367 --> 00:07:43.433
is if both of these vectors are going

00:07:43.433 --> 00:07:45.301
in the exact same direction,

00:07:45.301 --> 00:07:46.967
then they would be completely additive.

00:07:46.967 --> 00:07:49.633
But if they're going in even
slightly different directions,

00:07:49.633 --> 00:07:53.700
then you're not going to
have the magnitude of the sum

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:56.701
being the same as the magnitude.

00:07:56.701 --> 00:08:00.235
It's always going to be
less than the magnitude of

00:08:00.235 --> 00:08:02.234
or the sum of the magnitudes.

00:08:02.234 --> 00:08:03.967
In the next video, I'll talk about that

00:08:03.967 --> 00:08:05.846
in a little bit more depth.
