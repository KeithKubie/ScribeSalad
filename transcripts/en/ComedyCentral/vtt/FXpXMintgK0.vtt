00:00:00.251 --> 00:00:02.680
- Bert, you still are
meeting people after shows?

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:03.611
After these theater shows?

00:00:03.611 --> 00:00:04.501
- You should.

00:00:04.501 --> 00:00:06.451
- Tell me how you've been able to do it

00:00:06.451 --> 00:00:07.480
and not lose your mind.

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.860
And not not do it, because last weekend

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:11.221
I was in D.C. and I was like

00:00:11.221 --> 00:00:13.061
"I don't wanna be touched
by people right now"

00:00:13.061 --> 00:00:14.580
"I don't wanna do it".

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:15.680
- I don't normally get touched,

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.218
people take their shirts off.

00:00:17.218 --> 00:00:18.051
- [Nikki] Yeah I know.

00:00:18.051 --> 00:00:20.480
- Get a sweaty underarm
on top of your shoulder.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.130
(laughs)

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:23.579
- Dude the skin tags just ...

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:24.848
(rolls tongue)

00:00:24.848 --> 00:00:25.891
Oh here we go.

00:00:25.891 --> 00:00:29.120
I had one guy one time takes his shirt off

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:30.829
and he grabs me and I'm like

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:32.068
"Bro you are on fire" and he's like

00:00:32.068 --> 00:00:33.509
"Yeah I've got a pretty bad fever".

00:00:33.509 --> 00:00:34.349
(laughs)

00:00:34.349 --> 00:00:36.232
I was like ...

00:00:36.232 --> 00:00:37.759
I go "You're sick?"

00:00:37.759 --> 00:00:39.069
and he was like "Very sick".

00:00:39.069 --> 00:00:40.581
I was like "Dude, am I going to get sick?"

00:00:40.581 --> 00:00:42.109
he goes "Probably"

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:43.221
I was like "Why are you doing this?"

00:00:43.221 --> 00:00:44.229
he goes "I wasn't gonna miss this"

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:45.549
"for the fucking life of
me, are you kidding me?"

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:46.589
- [Nikki] No!

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:47.438
- That's so rude.

00:00:47.438 --> 00:00:49.741
- Dude I got sick as shit for that guy.

00:00:49.741 --> 00:00:52.324
(upbeat music)

00:00:53.468 --> 00:00:55.629
- I wanna ask you about
when you first drank

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:57.018
after Sober October.

00:00:57.018 --> 00:00:57.917
How good did that feel?

00:00:57.917 --> 00:01:00.098
And how bad did that
feel the next morning?

00:01:00.098 --> 00:01:01.109
Like how hard did you go?

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.229
What did you do?

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:04.479
- The first drink I had ...

00:01:05.691 --> 00:01:07.428
You know as crazy as I ...

00:01:07.428 --> 00:01:10.326
Like I mean, I'm just
measuring this by last night

00:01:10.326 --> 00:01:12.456
because last night was
the kind of drinking

00:01:12.456 --> 00:01:14.536
that I dislike, where like

00:01:14.536 --> 00:01:16.856
I'm just on a fucking
plane and I'm just ordering

00:01:16.856 --> 00:01:18.945
doubles after doubles after doubles.

00:01:18.945 --> 00:01:19.878
- [Nikki] How are you here?

00:01:19.878 --> 00:01:22.726
- And I'm like, oh it's
Mickey Mantle Gene.

00:01:22.726 --> 00:01:23.643
- He sluts.

00:01:25.184 --> 00:01:26.853
- That first weekend I drank

00:01:26.853 --> 00:01:28.812
it was all of a sudden like a brand new,

00:01:28.812 --> 00:01:30.949
it was like being 18 again and drinking

00:01:30.949 --> 00:01:32.693
and going "I just need one drink"

00:01:32.693 --> 00:01:34.232
and I'm feeling tired
and I'm gonna go home.

00:01:34.232 --> 00:01:36.957
And I was really measured

00:01:36.957 --> 00:01:38.957
and then I flew home

00:01:38.957 --> 00:01:41.040
and then my wife threw
a birthday part for me

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.419
and I had a ...

00:01:42.419 --> 00:01:45.571
That was Sunday and so it
was like a full bender Sunday

00:01:45.571 --> 00:01:48.499
and then we did Sober
October and I blacked out

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:50.240
during that podcast.

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.291
- I have no recollection of the last hour.

00:01:52.291 --> 00:01:54.779
I remember we all went to dinner,

00:01:54.779 --> 00:01:57.069
I know that I paid, I have
no idea what the bill was.

00:01:57.069 --> 00:02:00.347
I don't know if I tipped.
- [Nikki] I hate that feeling.

00:02:00.347 --> 00:02:01.787
- [Tom] That's the worst feeling.

00:02:01.787 --> 00:02:05.956
- I woke up the next
morning and I said to Tommy

00:02:05.956 --> 00:02:10.153
I was like, I would have
been equally as surprised

00:02:10.153 --> 00:02:12.441
had I've been chained in a basement

00:02:12.441 --> 00:02:14.060
versus waking up in my bed.

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.910
Both of them I was like, how
the fuck did this happen?

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.518
- Oh man, how often do you get that drUnk?

00:02:19.518 --> 00:02:21.318
- Not often, I mean I
think Sober October ...

00:02:21.318 --> 00:02:24.497
I mean we smoked a blunt,
I never smoke blunts.

00:02:24.497 --> 00:02:25.878
- I love blunts.

00:02:25.878 --> 00:02:27.588
- Oh I really enjoyed the blunts as well.

00:02:27.588 --> 00:02:28.729
- Yeah that's really fun.

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:30.777
- We drank a whole bottle of whiskey,

00:02:30.777 --> 00:02:32.158
we drank a bunch of beers.

00:02:32.158 --> 00:02:34.297
We were trying to bench press,

00:02:34.297 --> 00:02:36.948
I think Rogan pulled his leg,
pulled a muscle in his leg.

00:02:36.948 --> 00:02:39.238
We were trying to bench press 225.

00:02:39.238 --> 00:02:42.273
I'm fucking 46, why am I benching 225.

00:02:42.273 --> 00:02:43.212
- That's three of me.

00:02:43.212 --> 00:02:44.045
- Yeah.

00:02:44.045 --> 00:02:47.021
And so or a little bit less of me.

00:02:47.021 --> 00:02:48.241
(laughs)

00:02:48.241 --> 00:02:50.121
- But don't you feel
like after you have been

00:02:50.121 --> 00:02:54.521
so sober and so clean
it's like you got so clean

00:02:54.521 --> 00:02:55.966
and then it's like going backwards.

00:02:55.966 --> 00:02:58.405
You know that feeling of like
oh I did this and now ...

00:02:58.405 --> 00:03:00.282
- I'll tell you what's
interesting, remember those people

00:03:00.282 --> 00:03:02.760
that go "I eliminated
all food and then slowly"

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.441
"reintroduced things back into my diet"

00:03:04.441 --> 00:03:06.532
"to figure out what I was allergic to."

00:03:06.532 --> 00:03:10.601
Alcohol is directly
connected to my anxiety

00:03:10.601 --> 00:03:13.070
and I think I always knew
that but I didn't realize

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:16.252
how hand in hand, what kissing cousins

00:03:16.252 --> 00:03:18.140
alcohol and anxiety are.

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.302
Because I was getting on planes and flying

00:03:20.302 --> 00:03:22.310
stone sober and being cool with it

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:23.750
and having no panic.

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.301
But man the uneasiness that
alcohol does to my stomach

00:03:26.301 --> 00:03:29.422
I get to the airport and I am like a mess.

00:03:29.422 --> 00:03:31.981
And then I'm like "Well fuck
I need a drink to calm down."

00:03:31.981 --> 00:03:32.932
- It's a cycle.

00:03:32.932 --> 00:03:34.936
- Yeah for sure.

00:03:34.936 --> 00:03:35.769
- Jeez.

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:36.741
- I think it's ...

00:03:36.741 --> 00:03:40.109
Because I've been dabbling
with the idea of maybe

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:41.895
drinking again and I'm just like ...

00:03:41.895 --> 00:03:43.014
- No don't do it.

00:03:43.014 --> 00:03:44.294
It's so not worth it.

00:03:44.294 --> 00:03:45.317
- And it's a depressant.

00:03:45.317 --> 00:03:46.597
And I'm already depressed.

00:03:46.597 --> 00:03:48.837
Why am I going to flirt with something

00:03:48.837 --> 00:03:51.544
that literally makes you depressed?

00:03:51.544 --> 00:03:55.186
- Mine is, I have the worst
acid reflux from drinking.

00:03:55.186 --> 00:03:57.495
Acid reflux so bad, like I
have one glass of something

00:03:57.495 --> 00:03:58.328
and it's like ...

00:03:58.328 --> 00:03:59.161
(retching)

00:03:59.161 --> 00:04:02.530
- Sleeping is the thing
that I value more than

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:03.560
anything else right now.

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.925
I slept so good during
the month of October.

00:04:05.925 --> 00:04:06.805
I slept so good.

00:04:06.805 --> 00:04:10.565
Now he's the difference, I slept
really good during October.

00:04:10.565 --> 00:04:13.752
The last night, wasted, wasted.

00:04:13.752 --> 00:04:15.877
Got into my hotel room at two, made a nice

00:04:15.877 --> 00:04:17.745
double T dose of soda.

00:04:17.745 --> 00:04:20.085
Killed it before bed and this morning

00:04:20.085 --> 00:04:22.485
I woke up with the most beautiful dream

00:04:22.485 --> 00:04:23.557
that I've ever had in my life

00:04:23.557 --> 00:04:25.965
and I hadn't been dreaming during October.

00:04:25.965 --> 00:04:27.215
I had just been sleeping.

00:04:27.215 --> 00:04:29.906
I had a dream where I
was sitting next to ...

00:04:29.906 --> 00:04:32.485
Have any of you guys
ever smoked cigarettes?

00:04:32.485 --> 00:04:33.455
- [Ian] I love 'em.

00:04:33.455 --> 00:04:36.515
- Sitting next to a
beautiful woman on a dock

00:04:36.515 --> 00:04:40.095
smoking a cigarette and I
was enjoying the cigarette.

00:04:40.095 --> 00:04:42.517
I was getting the buzz from
the nicotine in the dream.

00:04:42.517 --> 00:04:44.135
I'm getting the buzz from the nicotine.

00:04:44.135 --> 00:04:45.043
- Your stomach doesn't hurt.

00:04:45.043 --> 00:04:46.735
- Pulling it hard as shit.

00:04:46.735 --> 00:04:49.277
And we're recapping all
my dreams from the night

00:04:49.277 --> 00:04:51.631
me and her, like this is our rap, right?

00:04:51.631 --> 00:04:54.205
We did a great show, we
had a bunch of dreams.

00:04:54.205 --> 00:04:57.109
We robbed a bank, we
had to organize all my

00:04:57.109 --> 00:04:58.695
pants from Trip Flip.

00:04:58.695 --> 00:05:01.175
We did all these things
and then at the end

00:05:01.175 --> 00:05:04.005
she says "One more cigarette?"

00:05:04.005 --> 00:05:07.397
and I went "Yeah" and I knew
I wasn't going to smoke again

00:05:07.397 --> 00:05:08.695
but I just hit it really hard

00:05:08.695 --> 00:05:11.495
and then I said
- You have cerebral palsy.

00:05:11.495 --> 00:05:14.104
- I haven't kissed someone
who's smoked a cigarette

00:05:14.104 --> 00:05:17.264
in so long, I wonder if I can taste it.

00:05:17.264 --> 00:05:18.995
And she said "I don't know
we should try kissing"

00:05:18.995 --> 00:05:21.047
and I went "Okay" and we started kissing.

00:05:21.047 --> 00:05:23.986
I woke up and went "What a
beautiful way to start my day."

00:05:23.986 --> 00:05:26.135
I literally was like "I'm back baby"

00:05:26.135 --> 00:05:28.675
and I was like splashing water on the face

00:05:28.675 --> 00:05:30.066
time to go to SiriusXM.

00:05:30.066 --> 00:05:31.586
We got a long fucking day B man,

00:05:31.586 --> 00:05:34.636
try to strap it on big boy.

00:05:34.636 --> 00:05:35.469
- We're back with the show.

00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:38.169
Bert, was were you just about
to ask me about my drinking?

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:40.809
- So when you talk about drinking again

00:05:40.809 --> 00:05:42.559
what part do you miss?

00:05:42.559 --> 00:05:44.878
Because I'll tell you the parts that I ...

00:05:44.878 --> 00:05:46.009
- I'll tell you exactly the part.

00:05:46.009 --> 00:05:47.342
- Okay go.

00:05:47.342 --> 00:05:50.988
- I miss this Nikki, when
someone walks in a room

00:05:50.988 --> 00:05:54.028
like you're drinking at the
Comedy Cellar back table.

00:05:54.028 --> 00:05:55.094
I miss seeing someone and going

00:05:55.094 --> 00:05:57.134
"Oh shit there he is".

00:05:57.134 --> 00:05:58.129
(laughs)

00:05:58.129 --> 00:05:59.854
That drunk, I miss that Nikki.

00:05:59.854 --> 00:06:01.813
I don't get that excited
about seeing people anymore.

00:06:01.813 --> 00:06:03.363
That's two drink Nikki.

00:06:03.363 --> 00:06:06.155
Kind of like rocking out
like feeling the music

00:06:06.155 --> 00:06:07.545
and just excited.

00:06:07.545 --> 00:06:08.423
I miss that.

00:06:08.423 --> 00:06:11.820
- You don't get from weed
like that a little bit?

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:14.081
- I will find certain
times that it helps me

00:06:14.081 --> 00:06:16.451
but it's different with drinking.

00:06:16.451 --> 00:06:18.328
You know what, I finished
Joe Rogan's podcast

00:06:18.328 --> 00:06:21.203
and I stole a kombucha from his fridge

00:06:21.203 --> 00:06:22.772
right afterwards because they get so much.

00:06:22.772 --> 00:06:24.234
And I grabbed one of the alcoholic ones

00:06:24.234 --> 00:06:25.674
and I chugged it in the car

00:06:25.674 --> 00:06:28.168
and I got like one drink drunk.

00:06:28.168 --> 00:06:30.641
And my friend who was sober was driving me

00:06:30.641 --> 00:06:31.954
and she goes "Oh my god, Nikki"

00:06:31.954 --> 00:06:34.412
Carlisle, she was like "That's alcoholic"

00:06:34.412 --> 00:06:35.940
and I was like "Oh my god"

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:37.343
and I just thought I'm
going to enjoy this.

00:06:37.343 --> 00:06:38.292
I turned the music up

00:06:38.292 --> 00:06:40.193
I was like I get to be
drunk for the first time

00:06:40.193 --> 00:06:42.081
in seven years and probably the last time.

00:06:42.081 --> 00:06:45.731
And I had the best time
like singing to music.

00:06:45.731 --> 00:06:47.597
That's the drunk I miss Bert.

00:06:47.597 --> 00:06:49.483
- You don't miss the ...

00:06:49.483 --> 00:06:52.310
My favorite drunk is family's asleep,

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:53.901
I'm in the man cave

00:06:53.901 --> 00:06:56.401
and I'm gonna put the lights out

00:06:56.401 --> 00:06:57.481
I'm gonna light some candles

00:06:57.481 --> 00:06:59.019
and I'm gonna get my
speedo, maybe a cowboy hat

00:06:59.019 --> 00:07:01.001
and I'm gonna just go through

00:07:01.001 --> 00:07:05.419
the entire Smiths catalog
and listen to The Smiths

00:07:05.419 --> 00:07:07.830
and get weird as fuck.

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:12.036
- ♪ To die by your side would
be a heavenly way to die. ♪

00:07:12.036 --> 00:07:13.067
- I love that one.

00:07:13.067 --> 00:07:14.636
- Dude.
- Your daughter wakes up

00:07:14.636 --> 00:07:17.169
by accident, goes
downstairs like "Uh, dad?"

00:07:17.169 --> 00:07:18.518
- Daddy what are you ...

00:07:18.518 --> 00:07:20.179
- My wife came out one time

00:07:20.179 --> 00:07:23.096
and I had watched a movie about the

00:07:26.757 --> 00:07:28.390
new age, when new age came to Britain.

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:29.223
- Oh yeah.

00:07:29.223 --> 00:07:30.056
- And I just got ...

00:07:30.056 --> 00:07:31.979
And I was obsessed, I'm on repeat.

00:07:31.979 --> 00:07:36.050
I must have listened 100
times to the Talking Heads.

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:38.889
One of their first, I
forget which one it was,

00:07:38.889 --> 00:07:40.379
Serial Killer?

00:07:40.379 --> 00:07:41.212
- Psycho Killer.

00:07:41.212 --> 00:07:42.045
- [Bert] Psycho Killer.

00:07:42.045 --> 00:07:43.625
- Yeah that whole album
is fucking incredible.

00:07:43.625 --> 00:07:46.354
- It really is, that's my
favorite kind of drunk.

00:07:46.354 --> 00:07:48.610
- Okay yeah, music.

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:49.443
Getting weird by ...

00:07:49.443 --> 00:07:50.276
I do miss that too.

00:07:50.276 --> 00:07:51.924
- I miss just turning my phone off,

00:07:51.924 --> 00:07:53.955
drawing the shades and
just drinking by myself

00:07:53.955 --> 00:07:55.503
and alienating all my friends.

00:07:55.503 --> 00:07:58.675
- Yeah Ian has such a
problem with drinking

00:07:58.675 --> 00:08:00.886
that the things you miss get real ...

00:08:00.886 --> 00:08:02.521
They're not even fun weird.

00:08:02.521 --> 00:08:04.504
They're just sad weird.

00:08:04.504 --> 00:08:05.795
- I miss like waking up in the hospital

00:08:05.795 --> 00:08:07.985
and then proving to myself
that it won't happen again.

00:08:07.985 --> 00:08:08.945
(laughs)

00:08:08.945 --> 00:08:12.270
- That's the kind of drinking I miss.

00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:13.103
- You do.

00:08:13.103 --> 00:08:15.614
You're always like ...

00:08:15.614 --> 00:08:17.854
What would happen right
now if you had a drink?

00:08:17.854 --> 00:08:19.825
What would become of your day?

00:08:19.825 --> 00:08:20.955
- 40 drinks later.

00:08:20.955 --> 00:08:24.435
- I mean I wouldn't stop, I would end up

00:08:24.435 --> 00:08:26.413
finding cocaine and then I would just ...

00:08:26.413 --> 00:08:28.045
- Yeah that's the problem
for a lot of guys.

00:08:28.045 --> 00:08:31.114
- End up getting with a
prostitute, wasting my money

00:08:31.114 --> 00:08:33.422
and being like "This
dumpster looks comfortable".

00:08:33.422 --> 00:08:35.309
(laughs)

00:08:35.309 --> 00:08:37.233
- Yeah I got rejected at
a glory hole yesterday.

00:08:37.233 --> 00:08:38.870
- I don't miss that, I
don't miss that at all.

00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:39.703
- Wait is that true?

00:08:39.703 --> 00:08:40.536
- [Bert] Wait what?

00:08:40.536 --> 00:08:42.921
- I'm so glad, I just kind of teased it

00:08:42.921 --> 00:08:44.252
because I wanted to see if he wanted

00:08:44.252 --> 00:08:46.002
to talk about it on air,
because I forgot to ask him

00:08:46.002 --> 00:08:48.071
and he just gave me the heads up.

00:08:48.071 --> 00:08:51.471
You got rejected at a
glory hole yesterday.

00:08:51.471 --> 00:08:53.820
- Wait at a glory hole or
at Glory Hole like the bar?

00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:54.653
- At a glory hole.

00:08:54.653 --> 00:08:55.570
- A glory hole.

00:08:55.570 --> 00:08:56.403
- How do you ...

00:08:56.403 --> 00:08:57.236
Did they flick it?

00:08:57.236 --> 00:08:58.069
What happens?

00:08:58.069 --> 00:08:58.902
- [Ian] No.

00:08:58.902 --> 00:08:59.735
(laughs)

00:08:59.735 --> 00:09:02.360
- They swipe the dick tip.

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:03.566
- Swipe left.

00:09:03.566 --> 00:09:05.225
- These are not the
dicks we're looking for.

00:09:05.225 --> 00:09:06.075
(laughs)

00:09:06.075 --> 00:09:09.150
- They just start pushing it back in.

00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:10.796
Like they're trying to get one of those

00:09:10.796 --> 00:09:13.296
fake snakes back into the can.

00:09:14.208 --> 00:09:16.655
- They blow on it, yeah.

00:09:16.655 --> 00:09:18.072
So, explain that.

00:09:19.079 --> 00:09:19.912
- Walk us through this.

00:09:19.912 --> 00:09:23.050
What made you end up going to a glory hole

00:09:23.050 --> 00:09:24.079
in the first place?

00:09:24.079 --> 00:09:26.159
- Start by where it's at,
because I'd love to swing by.

00:09:26.159 --> 00:09:27.098
(laughs)

00:09:27.098 --> 00:09:27.931
- You wanna after this?

00:09:27.931 --> 00:09:29.428
It's quite an experience.

00:09:29.428 --> 00:09:31.028
It's on 21st on 8th
- Can girls go?

00:09:31.028 --> 00:09:31.988
- Yeah yeah, well they
don't like fish but ...

00:09:31.988 --> 00:09:34.269
- Dude you were like two
blocks from my apartment

00:09:34.269 --> 00:09:35.498
getting rejected.

00:09:35.498 --> 00:09:37.100
You gotta come over after that.

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:38.599
I know you were feeling sad.

00:09:38.599 --> 00:09:39.432
- Yeah.

00:09:39.432 --> 00:09:40.820
- Okay so what led you there?

00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:44.275
- I don't know I've just
been real horned up lately.

00:09:44.275 --> 00:09:46.777
- You're seeing somebody
though also right?

00:09:46.777 --> 00:09:48.196
- [Ian] Yeah she knows.

00:09:48.196 --> 00:09:49.354
- But like she.
- She knows about

00:09:49.354 --> 00:09:50.187
the glory hole.

00:09:50.187 --> 00:09:51.866
- She wasn't going to fulfill
what you wanted in that.

00:09:51.866 --> 00:09:52.699
- Right, right.

00:09:52.699 --> 00:09:54.333
And more, like with the drinking thing

00:09:54.333 --> 00:09:55.726
like I don't miss getting drunk.

00:09:55.726 --> 00:09:58.786
I miss waking up in a
fucking bag of trash.

00:09:58.786 --> 00:10:00.338
I miss the craziness of it.

00:10:00.338 --> 00:10:01.171
- [Bert] Chaos.

00:10:01.171 --> 00:10:02.004
- Yeah.

00:10:02.004 --> 00:10:05.313
So like I was getting off
more on the fact of like

00:10:05.313 --> 00:10:09.376
walking in and having
some 6"4 Dominican guy

00:10:09.376 --> 00:10:11.826
hate my dick and me being
like "Yeah let's do this".

00:10:11.826 --> 00:10:15.156
Like that was what got
me off, rather than like

00:10:15.156 --> 00:10:15.989
I'm going to get my dick sucked.

00:10:15.989 --> 00:10:17.512
- I like that experience too,
I like weird experiences.

00:10:17.512 --> 00:10:19.594
- The dangerous thing of
me trying to get a blow job

00:10:19.594 --> 00:10:22.468
while a guy's mopping up
come in the staff next to me.

00:10:22.468 --> 00:10:24.176
- [Jade] Beautiful, yeah.

00:10:24.176 --> 00:10:25.150
- So you go in.

00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:25.983
- [Ian] So I went in.

00:10:25.983 --> 00:10:27.329
- Wait how do you know that this exists?

00:10:27.329 --> 00:10:28.819
Is there like an app or like ...

00:10:28.819 --> 00:10:30.580
- No you like cruise around.

00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:33.713
- You just walk around looking
like Ian and they find you.

00:10:33.713 --> 00:10:35.089
- [Bert] Sorry sir, that's an eyehole.

00:10:35.089 --> 00:10:37.172
(laughs)

00:10:39.324 --> 00:10:40.960
- Oh my god, yeah how do you?

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:41.793
You just know?

00:10:41.793 --> 00:10:42.626
People are like hey there's a hole here.

00:10:42.626 --> 00:10:44.578
- This mustache is attractive
for shit like this.

00:10:44.578 --> 00:10:46.367
- Sir that's a man hole,
we're down here doing work.

00:10:46.367 --> 00:10:47.646
(laughs)

00:10:47.646 --> 00:10:49.109
- Trying to get some work done myself.

00:10:49.109 --> 00:10:51.399
- You just start sticking
your dick in everything.

00:10:51.399 --> 00:10:54.262
- Trying to fix the L drain.

00:10:54.262 --> 00:10:55.474
- You gotta stick your
dick in a lot of holes

00:10:55.474 --> 00:10:56.895
before you find it.
- Sir that's a bird house.

00:10:56.895 --> 00:10:57.833
(laughs)

00:10:57.833 --> 00:11:02.199
- Sir are you trying to
make a deposit in the bank?

00:11:02.199 --> 00:11:03.695
- I just keep sliding my dick through.

00:11:03.695 --> 00:11:05.362
- That's a bee hive.

00:11:06.528 --> 00:11:07.433
(dolphin squeak)

00:11:07.433 --> 00:11:09.170
- Wait that's a dolphin.

00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:11.087
- [Jade] That's a hole.

00:11:12.707 --> 00:11:13.540
- Get off me.

00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:14.373
- Ow!

00:11:14.373 --> 00:11:15.206
- Ow!

00:11:16.206 --> 00:11:17.039
- [Bert] That's a dolphin.

00:11:17.039 --> 00:11:19.542
- Sir that's my vagina.

00:11:19.542 --> 00:11:20.388
- Oh disgusting.

00:11:20.388 --> 00:11:21.388
- Not today.

00:11:22.425 --> 00:11:24.524
- Sir that's my vagina.

00:11:24.524 --> 00:11:25.945
- Only when I'm in the mood.

00:11:25.945 --> 00:11:28.345
- I want a man to suck my
dick through your vagina.

00:11:28.345 --> 00:11:29.814
(laughs)

00:11:29.814 --> 00:11:31.814
- Tapping on the vagina.

00:11:33.650 --> 00:11:35.392
- Okay those are good.

00:11:35.392 --> 00:11:37.645
Walk us through ...

00:11:37.645 --> 00:11:39.303
- So I ...

00:11:39.303 --> 00:11:41.386
(laughs)

00:11:44.087 --> 00:11:47.587
Call me when that vagina turns into a man.

00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:52.034
So I went in and this
fucking guy when I walked by

00:11:52.034 --> 00:11:54.935
went "Mhmmm" and I was
like "Alright I'm in".

00:11:54.935 --> 00:11:56.393
So I went in, I kind of looked around

00:11:56.393 --> 00:11:57.982
and you know ...

00:11:57.982 --> 00:11:59.103
- [Jade] What kind of hole's that?

00:11:59.103 --> 00:12:00.499
- It's like a very eye contacty thing.

00:12:00.499 --> 00:12:01.332
- It's a store, right?

00:12:01.332 --> 00:12:02.775
- It's in the back of a store.

00:12:02.775 --> 00:12:04.719
All the porno shops you see, in the back

00:12:04.719 --> 00:12:05.632
they have these fucking stalls.

00:12:05.632 --> 00:12:06.522
- Oh a porn store.

00:12:06.522 --> 00:12:08.163
It's not like a best buy, okay cool.

00:12:08.163 --> 00:12:10.712
- No, no, you gotta go
to the Salvation Army

00:12:10.712 --> 00:12:12.433
and ask for Ted.

00:12:12.433 --> 00:12:13.850
- [Jade] Ew, Ted.

00:12:14.827 --> 00:12:19.827
- So I went in and you know I
thought this guy was whatever

00:12:19.984 --> 00:12:21.569
and then I was standing ...

00:12:21.569 --> 00:12:22.919
- You thought what guy was whatever?

00:12:22.919 --> 00:12:23.889
Where are the guys standing?

00:12:23.889 --> 00:12:24.722
I don't understand.

00:12:24.722 --> 00:12:26.359
- They stand outside the
stalls and you've gotta

00:12:26.359 --> 00:12:27.879
kind of like look and be like

00:12:27.879 --> 00:12:29.889
give like a look of like "What's up?"

00:12:29.889 --> 00:12:31.599
- Cut to a sketch of me going

00:12:31.599 --> 00:12:32.878
"So what are we in line for?"

00:12:32.878 --> 00:12:34.959
(laughs)

00:12:34.959 --> 00:12:35.792
- "You're next".

00:12:35.792 --> 00:12:37.337
"Oh sweet, oh you guys
are going to let me cut?"

00:12:37.337 --> 00:12:38.902
- A dick just pops out of a hole.

00:12:38.902 --> 00:12:40.599
- Is this Apple returns?

00:12:40.599 --> 00:12:42.268
(laughs)

00:12:42.268 --> 00:12:43.988
- So you know who the guys is.

00:12:43.988 --> 00:12:46.977
Isn't it supposed to be
you don't know who is it?

00:12:46.977 --> 00:12:48.408
Isn't that the hole
point of the glory hole?

00:12:48.408 --> 00:12:49.878
- Sometimes you can go into a thing

00:12:49.878 --> 00:12:52.139
and there's just a treat waiting for you.

00:12:52.139 --> 00:12:54.769
But other times you make eye contact.

00:12:54.769 --> 00:12:55.602
- And you go,

00:12:55.602 --> 00:12:57.316
"do you want to make out
with me through a wall?"

00:12:57.316 --> 00:12:58.507
- Why don't just blow each other then?

00:12:58.507 --> 00:13:00.948
Why the hole aspect?

00:13:00.948 --> 00:13:03.302
- Because it's like a ...

00:13:03.302 --> 00:13:04.659
- The smell of cedar.

00:13:04.659 --> 00:13:07.859
- I didn't invent it, I'm just using it.

00:13:07.859 --> 00:13:12.859
- You wanna like size him up,
see what his mouth looks like.

00:13:13.243 --> 00:13:15.410
- Yeah, I'm not a heathen.

00:13:16.250 --> 00:13:19.518
- But really, the wall
does seem stupid then.

00:13:19.518 --> 00:13:20.548
- Yeah I don't understand the wall.

00:13:20.548 --> 00:13:22.358
- Why not just get a booth and
blow each other in a booth?

00:13:22.358 --> 00:13:23.548
- Right.

00:13:23.548 --> 00:13:26.089
- What's the deal with
the wall separation?

00:13:26.089 --> 00:13:28.048
- It's kind of nice because
once it's over, it's over.

00:13:28.048 --> 00:13:29.063
- Yeah that's true.

00:13:29.063 --> 00:13:31.209
- It's like, there's
no awkward eye contact

00:13:31.209 --> 00:13:33.070
you're like fucking thank God that's over.

00:13:33.070 --> 00:13:35.068
- And then you just finish and you leave

00:13:35.068 --> 00:13:36.044
and you never see them again.

00:13:36.044 --> 00:13:36.943
- Is it a thin wall?

00:13:36.943 --> 00:13:39.610
- It's like ply.
- It better be.

00:13:40.664 --> 00:13:41.497
Paper thin.

00:13:41.497 --> 00:13:43.540
- If your dick didn't fit all the way in.

00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:45.650
- It could take like half
an inch off your dick.

00:13:45.650 --> 00:13:48.076
- It could be like this thick of a wall.

00:13:48.076 --> 00:13:50.354
- And then half an inch
means a lot to men, I think.

00:13:50.354 --> 00:13:52.482
- Oh I'd be using that
excuse the whole time.

00:13:52.482 --> 00:13:54.253
I'd be like "Look, this is a thick wall".

00:13:54.253 --> 00:13:56.384
"You can't see it on
your end, it's very big".

00:13:56.384 --> 00:13:57.984
- "It's a thick wall".

00:13:57.984 --> 00:13:58.944
"Got a thick wall here".

00:13:58.944 --> 00:14:01.069
- But wait how tall is the wall?

00:14:01.069 --> 00:14:01.902
Can you see?

00:14:01.902 --> 00:14:03.352
Is the wall like this short?

00:14:03.352 --> 00:14:04.185
- No no.

00:14:04.185 --> 00:14:06.435
- No these are Trump walls.

00:14:07.392 --> 00:14:08.678
- Wait so they don't even exist?

00:14:08.678 --> 00:14:09.600
Holey shit.

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:11.181
- That's what you should
do, you should start

00:14:11.181 --> 00:14:13.089
lobbying to put glory holes in the wall.

00:14:13.089 --> 00:14:14.920
(laughs)

00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:16.429
- That would bring more people out to vote

00:14:16.429 --> 00:14:18.666
if we voting booths were glory holes.

00:14:18.666 --> 00:14:21.059
- Wait I wish the wall was just this tall

00:14:21.059 --> 00:14:23.010
so you're just peaking over it.

00:14:23.010 --> 00:14:25.148
- Just making direct eye contact.

00:14:25.148 --> 00:14:27.934
- You cannot see each other when like ...

00:14:27.934 --> 00:14:28.978
But you're on your knees

00:14:28.978 --> 00:14:30.000
so you would be able to see them anyway?

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.303
- No you're not on your knees.

00:14:32.303 --> 00:14:34.225
- There's a pew.

00:14:34.225 --> 00:14:35.376
- It's a pew.

00:14:35.376 --> 00:14:36.996
It's a confession booth.

00:14:36.996 --> 00:14:38.617
And if you want to get
to heaven, you've got to

00:14:38.617 --> 00:14:40.690
suck father's pee pee.

00:14:40.690 --> 00:14:41.927
- [Jade] Ew, got so real.

00:14:41.927 --> 00:14:43.135
- So you don't kneel?

00:14:43.135 --> 00:14:44.868
- No, you can kneel,
you don't have to kneel.

00:14:44.868 --> 00:14:46.951
There's a little chair.

00:14:46.951 --> 00:14:47.784
- You know what would be a
perfect blow job giving thing.

00:14:47.784 --> 00:14:49.382
- Who cleans that chair?

00:14:49.382 --> 00:14:52.920
- Is like the massage
chairs that you sit in

00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:55.272
in the mall and you lean forward.

00:14:55.272 --> 00:14:57.107
That would be a good blow job chair.

00:14:57.107 --> 00:14:59.512
- Oh yeah it would.

00:14:59.512 --> 00:15:00.686
- [Bert] Oh they have that porn.

00:15:00.686 --> 00:15:02.704
- Oh I know Bert.

00:15:02.704 --> 00:15:04.075
- Go to milking.com.

00:15:04.075 --> 00:15:05.535
- Oh my god milking.

00:15:05.535 --> 00:15:06.576
- What the hell is milking?

00:15:06.576 --> 00:15:08.429
- Milking, it's like a glory hole

00:15:08.429 --> 00:15:10.126
but you're laying on your stomach

00:15:10.126 --> 00:15:12.486
and a woman's just on
her knees just milking.

00:15:12.486 --> 00:15:14.976
- Wait, I have a dream
that I go to a sauna

00:15:14.976 --> 00:15:16.715
and I sit and underneath there's someone

00:15:16.715 --> 00:15:18.073
eating me out through a hole.

00:15:18.073 --> 00:15:19.184
- That's my dream.

00:15:19.184 --> 00:15:20.224
- [Jade] Yeah like I want that.

00:15:20.224 --> 00:15:21.526
- By dream, you mean fantasy?

00:15:21.526 --> 00:15:22.496
- No I mean reality.

00:15:22.496 --> 00:15:23.616
- [Nikki] Like you want that to happen.

00:15:23.616 --> 00:15:24.449
- Day dream.

00:15:24.449 --> 00:15:26.980
- Glory hole for a woman.

00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:27.813
That's what I want.

00:15:27.813 --> 00:15:28.646
- There would just be listening.

00:15:28.646 --> 00:15:29.648
- While I'm in like a sauna place.

00:15:29.648 --> 00:15:31.903
- [Bert] Oh my god.

00:15:31.903 --> 00:15:34.216
I was in a sauna in Miami.

00:15:34.216 --> 00:15:36.116
When you used to stay across the street

00:15:36.116 --> 00:15:37.867
at one of the places,
they had a sauna in there.

00:15:37.867 --> 00:15:40.078
And Leanne was coming to visit me,

00:15:40.078 --> 00:15:41.248
she was pregnant with Isla

00:15:41.248 --> 00:15:42.767
and I walked into the sauna

00:15:42.767 --> 00:15:45.767
and this girl walks in totally naked

00:15:46.678 --> 00:15:47.568
into the sauna.

00:15:47.568 --> 00:15:48.518
I have shorts on.

00:15:48.518 --> 00:15:52.101
Totally naked but with
shell top Adidas on.

00:15:54.497 --> 00:15:55.330
- Wait what?

00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:56.163
Tennis shoes?

00:15:56.163 --> 00:15:57.187
- Yeah and no socks.

00:15:57.187 --> 00:15:58.020
- Ew.

00:15:58.020 --> 00:15:58.859
- And she was like.

00:15:58.859 --> 00:15:59.865
- [Jade] Whore.

00:15:59.865 --> 00:16:01.344
- She was like "You don't have
to wear your pants in here"

00:16:01.344 --> 00:16:03.688
and I was like "Oh yeah, I'm
probably just going to wear"

00:16:03.688 --> 00:16:05.515
"my pants" and she was like
"Well I'm not wearing clothes"

00:16:05.515 --> 00:16:06.587
and I was like "Cool".

00:16:06.587 --> 00:16:07.596
And we're sitting there for a while

00:16:07.596 --> 00:16:08.429
and I'm so uncomfortable.

00:16:08.429 --> 00:16:09.939
And she's like "Do you have a room here?"

00:16:09.939 --> 00:16:11.638
and I was like ...
- Jesus.

00:16:11.638 --> 00:16:16.093
- And I was so creeped out
that she wasn't wearing socks.

00:16:16.093 --> 00:16:17.019
- [Jade] I think it's disgusting.

00:16:17.019 --> 00:16:18.102
- Disgusting.

00:16:19.348 --> 00:16:20.699
- [Bert] Oh fucking horrible.

00:16:20.699 --> 00:16:21.808
- Those shoes are ruined.

00:16:21.808 --> 00:16:23.120
- And I was like "My pregnant
wife's on her way here"

00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:24.339
and then I just got out.

00:16:24.339 --> 00:16:28.069
By the way, there's nothing
better than having sauna cock.

00:16:28.069 --> 00:16:29.419
Sauna cock is ...

00:16:29.419 --> 00:16:30.577
- What's sauna cock?

00:16:30.577 --> 00:16:32.390
- Sauna cock, are you serious?

00:16:32.390 --> 00:16:33.539
- Sounds like a sound system.

00:16:33.539 --> 00:16:34.720
- [Tom] Like a toothbrush.

00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:36.369
- Something that's going
to sponsor the show.

00:16:36.369 --> 00:16:37.574
- You can stick it on your mirror.

00:16:37.574 --> 00:16:38.844
- [Ian] Have you guys
ever used sauna cock?

00:16:38.844 --> 00:16:42.904
- Sauna cock is basically when you're just

00:16:42.904 --> 00:16:44.854
you're in a sauna for like 30 minutes

00:16:44.854 --> 00:16:47.675
and your dick, all the
blood is going everywhere

00:16:47.675 --> 00:16:49.814
and your dick is just huge.

00:16:49.814 --> 00:16:53.771
- That's why I wanna get
eaten out on a sauna.

00:16:53.771 --> 00:16:55.854
Cause you get sauna clit.

00:16:57.469 --> 00:16:58.302
- Sauna clit.

00:16:58.302 --> 00:17:00.760
- That sounds like a toothbrush.

00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:02.963
- And it does get like a little swollen.

00:17:02.963 --> 00:17:06.202
- You're soaking up
all the heat and stuff.

00:17:06.202 --> 00:17:08.213
- All the blood just
rushes down to your clit.

00:17:08.213 --> 00:17:10.573
Wait can, p.s. this is not a plug

00:17:10.573 --> 00:17:12.474
but can that vibrator
that you recommended me

00:17:12.474 --> 00:17:14.474
the Womenizer has changed my life.

00:17:14.474 --> 00:17:15.474
- [Nikki] Thank you.

00:17:15.474 --> 00:17:18.213
- It is a flesh light for
your clit, it's crazy.

00:17:18.213 --> 00:17:19.464
- It sucks your clit.
- What?

00:17:19.464 --> 00:17:20.834
- Oh you haven't heard of this?

00:17:20.834 --> 00:17:22.514
- [Jade] It's amazing.

00:17:22.514 --> 00:17:26.304
- It's changed the game with orgasms.

00:17:26.304 --> 00:17:28.485
I didn't know I can squirt.

00:17:28.485 --> 00:17:32.090
I didn't know until I had the Womanizer.

00:17:32.090 --> 00:17:34.002
- I'm afraid that I get this from my wife

00:17:34.002 --> 00:17:35.882
and then sub myself out of
the game all of a sudden.

00:17:35.882 --> 00:17:36.813
- No no no, it's different.

00:17:36.813 --> 00:17:38.658
It's a different feeling.

00:17:38.658 --> 00:17:39.491
- Men can learn from it,

00:17:39.491 --> 00:17:40.821
I've been talking about this on stage.

00:17:40.821 --> 00:17:43.922
If you go down on us, stop
the rubbing your face in it

00:17:43.922 --> 00:17:44.920
or whatever you do.

00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:48.182
Suck our clit.
- Sneezing in it.

00:17:48.182 --> 00:17:49.015
- Coughing in it.

00:17:49.015 --> 00:17:49.848
- Blowing your nose.

00:17:49.848 --> 00:17:50.741
Whispering in secrets.

00:17:50.741 --> 00:17:51.681
- The alphabet thing, it's bull shit.

00:17:51.681 --> 00:17:53.000
- Singing a song to it.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:54.864
- The alphabet sucks.

00:17:54.864 --> 00:17:56.114
Licking is fun.

00:17:58.050 --> 00:17:59.071
- What's it called?

00:17:59.071 --> 00:18:00.404
- The Womanizer.

00:18:01.752 --> 00:18:02.910
- How come Louis came up?

00:18:02.910 --> 00:18:04.493
No I'm kidding.

00:18:04.493 --> 00:18:06.065
By the way sorry, I'm
sorry, I shouldn't do that.

00:18:06.065 --> 00:18:07.956
- I have a code right now that you can use

00:18:07.956 --> 00:18:08.966
it's JADE20.

00:18:08.966 --> 00:18:09.799
- [Nikki] What?

00:18:09.799 --> 00:18:10.836
- Yeah all caps, JADE20.

00:18:10.836 --> 00:18:11.916
- How the fuck did you get a code?

00:18:11.916 --> 00:18:14.607
- Because she commented on
one of my Instagram photos

00:18:14.607 --> 00:18:17.456
like "Get the Womanizer" so
I just texted them directly.

00:18:17.456 --> 00:18:21.116
I was like sending me one,
I'll review it on my story.

00:18:21.116 --> 00:18:21.949
- Oh my god.

00:18:21.949 --> 00:18:23.476
- So they sent me one and it's been ...

00:18:23.476 --> 00:18:25.377
Because you know what it
is, it doesn't feel like

00:18:25.377 --> 00:18:26.437
it goes inside you.

00:18:26.437 --> 00:18:28.415
You feel like you're
fucking it, in a weird way.

00:18:28.415 --> 00:18:29.623
- Is this it, the white thing?

00:18:29.623 --> 00:18:30.863
- Yeah but get the black or red.

00:18:30.863 --> 00:18:32.063
I regret getting the white one

00:18:32.063 --> 00:18:34.215
because it's too clinical looking for me.

00:18:34.215 --> 00:18:35.048
- Oh wow.

00:18:35.048 --> 00:18:35.881
- Too like futuristic.

00:18:35.881 --> 00:18:38.084
- [Bert] The Womanizer Starlet.

00:18:38.084 --> 00:18:39.100
Womanizer Premium.

00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:40.384
- It looks like a kazoo.

00:18:40.384 --> 00:18:41.734
- [Bert] Do you wanna
go Womanizer Premium?

00:18:41.734 --> 00:18:46.734
- I'm like getting excited
thinking about this toy.

00:18:46.817 --> 00:18:48.440
- Leanne doesn't like sex toys.

00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:51.044
I've always tried to
do that and she's like

00:18:51.044 --> 00:18:52.604
"Why would I do that when you're here?"

00:18:52.604 --> 00:18:54.276
and I'm like "I don't know
maybe for when I'm not here"

00:18:54.276 --> 00:18:55.109
"I don't know".

00:18:55.109 --> 00:18:55.942
- This one.

00:18:55.942 --> 00:18:56.775
Because you know what it is?

00:18:56.775 --> 00:18:59.063
It happens quickly too and then I giggle.

00:18:59.063 --> 00:19:00.266
- [Nikki] Me too.

00:19:00.266 --> 00:19:01.099
- I get hysterical.

00:19:01.099 --> 00:19:03.804
- It is a different kind of orgasm than

00:19:03.804 --> 00:19:06.345
you've experienced
before if you don't know

00:19:06.345 --> 00:19:08.534
this kind of suction orgasm.

00:19:08.534 --> 00:19:10.345
- But also it took me
a while to figure out

00:19:10.345 --> 00:19:11.178
how to use it.

00:19:11.178 --> 00:19:12.665
I was like, where does this go?

00:19:12.665 --> 00:19:15.625
- It's, the vagina is not user friendly.

00:19:15.625 --> 00:19:16.535
I'm confused by it.

00:19:16.535 --> 00:19:18.250
- [Bert] No shit.

00:19:18.250 --> 00:19:19.087
- My own.

00:19:19.087 --> 00:19:20.697
- Try not having one and
trying to figure it out.

00:19:20.697 --> 00:19:22.467
- I know I feel for you guys.

00:19:22.467 --> 00:19:25.616
- Figure it out on the fucking
like you're defusing a bomb.

00:19:25.616 --> 00:19:28.090
- The only manual's passive aggression.

00:19:28.090 --> 00:19:30.217
- You're in 9th grade
trying to figure it out.

00:19:30.217 --> 00:19:32.277
Wait I thought it's this high?

00:19:32.277 --> 00:19:33.110
It's lower?

00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:34.919
- It's way higher than
you think it will be.

00:19:34.919 --> 00:19:36.151
- I thought it was directly under.

00:19:36.151 --> 00:19:37.884
- I still don't know where I pee from.

00:19:37.884 --> 00:19:38.717
I still don't know.

00:19:38.717 --> 00:19:39.550
- Same it just comes out.

00:19:39.550 --> 00:19:40.383
- No idea where I pee from

00:19:40.383 --> 00:19:42.888
it is like a leak in a cave.

00:19:42.888 --> 00:19:43.905
- Yeah shut up.

00:19:43.905 --> 00:19:45.545
- I was 30 when I found
out there was two holes.

00:19:45.545 --> 00:19:48.446
(laughs)

00:19:48.446 --> 00:19:49.442
- Wait like vagina and a butt?

00:19:49.442 --> 00:19:50.333
Or a vagina?

00:19:50.333 --> 00:19:52.614
- I thought it just
came out of your vagina.

00:19:52.614 --> 00:19:53.502
- Oh your urethra.

00:19:53.502 --> 00:19:54.713
- Poured out of your everywhere.

00:19:54.713 --> 00:19:56.065
- I'm just finding that out.

00:19:56.065 --> 00:19:56.953
- Yeah your urethra.

00:19:56.953 --> 00:19:59.992
- It really does seem to
like creep from a crevice.

00:19:59.992 --> 00:20:02.134
You know when you look at a cave wall

00:20:02.134 --> 00:20:04.331
and there's water streaming down like

00:20:04.331 --> 00:20:06.398
where is this water coming from?

00:20:06.398 --> 00:20:08.054
That is exactly what it's like.

00:20:08.054 --> 00:20:11.195
It's very confusing but the Womanizer

00:20:11.195 --> 00:20:14.105
you definitely need to suck that clit

00:20:14.105 --> 00:20:16.126
- I agree and I'm like hey
you guys send me two more

00:20:16.126 --> 00:20:17.222
because I wanna give one to my mom

00:20:17.222 --> 00:20:18.283
and my sister so.

00:20:18.283 --> 00:20:22.043
- It makes sense because I
watched a video ages ago.

00:20:22.043 --> 00:20:23.442
(laughs)

00:20:23.442 --> 00:20:26.705
- That taught you how to eat pussy.

00:20:26.705 --> 00:20:28.931
Like it was an instructional
video by Nina Hartley.

00:20:28.931 --> 00:20:30.475
She's like an old porn star

00:20:30.475 --> 00:20:31.475
about how to eat pussy.

00:20:31.475 --> 00:20:33.374
I remember watching it and she said

00:20:33.374 --> 00:20:36.587
treat the clit like you
would your tiny penis.

00:20:36.587 --> 00:20:38.911
If your penis was very tiny,
what you would want done to it

00:20:38.911 --> 00:20:40.123
do exactly that.

00:20:40.123 --> 00:20:41.292
And it's an insane thing to say

00:20:41.292 --> 00:20:45.592
because guys don't want
to see gay or whatever.

00:20:45.592 --> 00:20:47.290
But give us a blow job on our clits.

00:20:47.290 --> 00:20:48.123
- It is a blow job.

00:20:48.123 --> 00:20:49.581
It is a tiny blow job.

00:20:49.581 --> 00:20:50.414
(sucking)

00:20:50.414 --> 00:20:51.674
Like literally like that.

00:20:51.674 --> 00:20:54.343
- [Nikki] Yeah it's really ...

00:20:54.343 --> 00:20:56.332
So that's my advice to you if you go down

00:20:56.332 --> 00:20:57.722
on a girl this weekend.

00:20:57.722 --> 00:21:00.232
Latch onto that thing like a barnacle

00:21:00.232 --> 00:21:02.532
on an old boat and don't let go

00:21:02.532 --> 00:21:04.672
until the captain sprays you off.

00:21:04.672 --> 00:21:05.842
(laughs)

00:21:05.842 --> 00:21:08.425
(upbeat music)
