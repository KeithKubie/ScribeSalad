00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:06.450
[music]

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:19.230
&gt;&gt;Giving everybody a voice from anywhere in
the planet. And I don't even think it's that

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.230
hard to do.

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:21.230
&gt;&gt;We need to reach out as caring citizens
and to help get these poverty victim's lives

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:22.230
back on track.

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:29.220
&gt;&gt;Somehow remodeling the economic system to
take into account [pause] the environment.

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.290
&gt;&gt;High schools should have scholarships for
seniors leaving the school.

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:38.660
&gt;&gt;A vehicle that runs on something other than
gasoline, that can easily be sold around the

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.200
world for everyone to access.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:47.720
&gt;&gt;Recycling saves energy. Pass it on. Spread
the word. Don't trash. Recycle, pass it on.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.860
&gt;&gt;Recycle, pass it on.

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:57.870
&gt;&gt;Too much of our resources go into livestock
production. Every year roughly 60 million

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.890
people starve to death. If America were to
reduce it's meat intake by just 10 percent

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:05.740
those 60 million people could be adequately
fed.

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:11.700
&gt;&gt;First, everybody of us and one euro or one
dollar or whatever you're paying in your contribute

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.590
for this government.

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:19.700
Second, it must be forbidden by law for elected
politicians to work for any corporations or

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.560
to have any other jobs beside.

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:30.080
If the government is paid directly by us it
might start to work directly for us. Know

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.080
what I'm saying.

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:37.899
&gt;&gt;Make solar panels by the millions, in India,
Europe, America, Japan.

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:39.420
[violin music]

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:47.219
&gt;&gt;My solution to Davos question is that governments
around the world take more action to rid people

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:52.069
of their complaints and mind sets, and encourage
citizens to be more eco friendly. Like giving

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:56.909
away things like free exhaust pipe filters
and coupons on energy saving bulbs. In short,

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.999
you need to start teaching people to stop
relying on the person next door to save the

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:01.999
world.

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:09.470
&gt;&gt;To accept and cherish in a positive, constructive
matter, the works of others. And to respect

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.040
yourself by only doing constructive things.

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.990
&gt;&gt;We can save thousands, if not millions,
of lives by simply providing mosquito nets

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:20.500
to malaria ridden areas around the world.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.200
&gt;&gt;We should be putting money into researching
the genetic engineering of plants so that

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.000
we can get more food out of every acre of
farm land.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.671
&gt;&gt;Make a website on which can be put lectures,
or debates, discussions about all sorts of

00:02:32.671 --> 00:02:39.360
important subjects like politics, economics,
religion, all that kind of stuff.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.940
&gt;&gt;If Central America was to unite in a manner
of cooperation much like the European union,

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:47.040
I believe they could have a much better economic
growth and they could more evenly distribute

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.790
funds to where it's most desperately needed.

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:55.340
&gt;&gt;The answer is simple, it's one word, perspective.
Global perspective.

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:00.060
&gt;&gt;At no other time in history have the countries
of this world been more empowered to promote

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.060
education.

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.920
&gt;&gt;Solutions must be made through collaboration
and knowledge and that is how we should change

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:06.920
the world.

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.650
&gt;&gt;Smile.

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.770
&gt;&gt;Have an open mind about everything and admit
that you could be wrong.

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:16.249
