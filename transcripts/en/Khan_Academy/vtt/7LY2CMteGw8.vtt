00:00:00.567 --> 00:00:02.381
- [Sal] We've already had several videos

00:00:02.381 --> 00:00:05.003
where we give an overview of the Crusades.

00:00:05.003 --> 00:00:09.574
And just as a review, they
happen over roughly 200 years

00:00:09.574 --> 00:00:11.589
during the High Middle Ages.

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:14.776
The first Crusade at very
end of the 11th century

00:00:14.776 --> 00:00:17.104
and actually the most
successful of the Crusades,

00:00:17.104 --> 00:00:20.406
allowing the Western European
powers to take control

00:00:20.406 --> 00:00:23.974
of Jerusalem and much of the Holy Land.

00:00:23.974 --> 00:00:26.289
And you could see that
here on this diagram

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:29.777
where Jerusalem, at least,
goes from green to red,

00:00:29.777 --> 00:00:34.101
controlled by the Western
European, the Latin Christians.

00:00:34.101 --> 00:00:35.891
And they're able to maintain control

00:00:35.891 --> 00:00:39.940
through these Crusader kingdoms
all the way until 1187,

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.107
when Salah ad-Din is able to
retake control of Jerusalem.

00:00:45.534 --> 00:00:48.860
Then a few decades later, as
we go into the Sixth Crusade

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.677
and the Barons' Crusade,
which isn't depicted here,

00:00:51.677 --> 00:00:53.921
the Western Europeans are
able to take more control

00:00:53.921 --> 00:00:56.869
but eventually, the Muslims
take control of Jerusalem

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:59.118
and as we enter into the 14th century,

00:00:59.118 --> 00:01:02.598
they have control of the entire Holy Land.

00:01:02.598 --> 00:01:06.049
Now while that is happening,
Constantinople gets sacked

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:09.527
at the end of the Fourth Crusade
by the Crusaders themselves

00:01:09.527 --> 00:01:12.471
and even though it's retaken,
this is really the beginning

00:01:12.471 --> 00:01:15.451
of the end for the Byzantine Empire.

00:01:15.451 --> 00:01:18.404
So let's think a little
bit about how the Crusades

00:01:18.404 --> 00:01:21.404
changed Europe and the entire world.

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.111
Well, one of the obvious
impacts of the Crusades

00:01:25.111 --> 00:01:28.172
was just the amount of death it caused.

00:01:28.172 --> 00:01:30.801
It's estimated that the
death toll from the Crusades

00:01:30.801 --> 00:01:35.369
is two to six million people
just from Western Europe.

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.440
And just to put that into perspective,

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.902
the European population at the time

00:01:39.902 --> 00:01:42.934
was about 60 to 70 million folks.

00:01:42.934 --> 00:01:46.395
So we're talking about four to
10 percent of the population

00:01:46.395 --> 00:01:48.276
dying in the Crusades.

00:01:48.276 --> 00:01:51.017
And this isn't fully
accounting for all of the death

00:01:51.017 --> 00:01:54.021
and destruction that happened
on the way to the Crusades

00:01:54.021 --> 00:01:57.185
or that happened in the
Middle East as well.

00:01:57.185 --> 00:02:00.201
If you look at this map of
what the region looks like

00:02:00.201 --> 00:02:04.902
as we get into the 14th
century, right over here,

00:02:04.902 --> 00:02:07.039
you can see that although the Middle East

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:09.506
is still in control of the Muslims,

00:02:09.506 --> 00:02:12.347
Muslims have for the
most part been pushed out

00:02:12.347 --> 00:02:15.141
of the Iberian Peninsula,
and they have a little bit

00:02:15.141 --> 00:02:17.404
of a foothold right here in Grenada.

00:02:17.404 --> 00:02:20.515
And this Reconquista is going to continue

00:02:20.515 --> 00:02:25.048
all the way until 1492 when
what will be the Spanish

00:02:25.048 --> 00:02:27.469
are able to push out all of the Muslims

00:02:27.469 --> 00:02:29.860
from the Iberian peninsula
and as they do that,

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.249
they also expel the Jews.

00:02:32.249 --> 00:02:35.498
You also have territorial
gains in the north of Europe

00:02:35.498 --> 00:02:38.297
that's a little bit harder
to see on this map over here.

00:02:38.297 --> 00:02:40.278
As I mentioned in previous video,

00:02:40.278 --> 00:02:44.512
part of this Crusader
mentality was not just about

00:02:44.512 --> 00:02:46.927
taking land back for the Byzantines

00:02:46.927 --> 00:02:49.193
or taking land from the Muslims,

00:02:49.193 --> 00:02:51.838
but also trying to take land or convert

00:02:51.838 --> 00:02:54.276
what were perceived as
pagans in the north,

00:02:54.276 --> 00:02:57.993
German tribes that had not as
yet converted to Christianity.

00:02:57.993 --> 00:03:00.070
And so that helped for
territorial expansion

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.538
in the north of Europe.

00:03:02.538 --> 00:03:06.705
Now a big theme in the Crusades
was the power of the Pope.

00:03:08.475 --> 00:03:11.511
Remember, the Crusades
were started by a Pope

00:03:11.511 --> 00:03:12.877
working people up, saying,

00:03:12.877 --> 00:03:14.655
"Hey, let's go help the Byzantines.

00:03:14.655 --> 00:03:16.687
"Let's go take back
land from the Muslims."

00:03:16.687 --> 00:03:18.045
Pope Urban II.

00:03:18.045 --> 00:03:20.743
And over the course of this 200 years,

00:03:20.743 --> 00:03:22.968
you have this religious fervor

00:03:22.968 --> 00:03:26.536
where the Pope is
organizing these Crusades.

00:03:26.536 --> 00:03:29.815
People are feeling this religious spirit.

00:03:29.815 --> 00:03:33.700
Many people are, before
going on their Crusade,

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.111
they're bequeathing
their land to the Church.

00:03:36.111 --> 00:03:39.648
If they die, and many of
these lords do end up dying,

00:03:39.648 --> 00:03:41.338
they're giving their
property to the Church,

00:03:41.338 --> 00:03:42.921
headed by the Pope.

00:03:43.802 --> 00:03:47.469
Kings also gained power
during the Crusades.

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:51.142
In other videos, we talk
about the feudal system

00:03:51.142 --> 00:03:53.860
and many times the vassals to the kings,

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:56.584
the dukes, the counts, the barons,

00:03:56.584 --> 00:03:59.273
often had more control
over their territory

00:03:59.273 --> 00:04:01.498
than the kings might have had.

00:04:01.498 --> 00:04:03.751
And they were constantly
squabbling with each other

00:04:03.751 --> 00:04:07.268
but as people started
to focus their energies

00:04:07.268 --> 00:04:10.786
on this external adventure
known as the Crusades,

00:04:10.786 --> 00:04:13.313
first of all, many of these lords died,

00:04:13.313 --> 00:04:15.313
their property went back to the state,

00:04:15.313 --> 00:04:17.194
went back to the kings.

00:04:17.194 --> 00:04:20.584
You start having less internal dissension.

00:04:20.584 --> 00:04:23.741
In a way, this idea that
Pope Urban II thought of

00:04:23.741 --> 00:04:25.138
at the end of the 11th century.

00:04:25.138 --> 00:04:27.635
Hey, why don't I point people externally

00:04:27.635 --> 00:04:30.361
so they stop worrying about
what's going on internally?

00:04:30.361 --> 00:04:32.272
It kind of worked.

00:04:32.272 --> 00:04:35.312
Another trend is the importance of cities.

00:04:35.312 --> 00:04:38.699
In the feudal system, it's
all about these manors

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:40.311
and all about these estates.

00:04:40.311 --> 00:04:42.942
But in order to finance the Crusades,

00:04:42.942 --> 00:04:46.572
centers of trade and commerce
became more important

00:04:46.572 --> 00:04:48.564
and also, as there was more interaction

00:04:48.564 --> 00:04:52.021
between West and East and
more people traveling,

00:04:52.021 --> 00:04:54.113
you can imagine that it fostered trade

00:04:54.113 --> 00:04:57.047
which centered at these cities.

00:04:57.047 --> 00:04:58.673
And that goes into the next point,

00:04:58.673 --> 00:05:02.332
commerce and trade itself
was fostered by the Crusades.

00:05:02.332 --> 00:05:04.181
It wasn't all fighting.

00:05:04.181 --> 00:05:08.347
The Venetians and other
trader city-states,

00:05:08.347 --> 00:05:12.137
they helped facilitate the
movement of arms and people

00:05:12.137 --> 00:05:15.071
from West to East, but on the way back,

00:05:15.071 --> 00:05:17.543
they also brought goods to trade.

00:05:17.543 --> 00:05:20.700
And so they became much,
much more powerful.

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:22.501
In fact, by the end of the Crusades,

00:05:22.501 --> 00:05:24.871
as we get into the 14th century,

00:05:24.871 --> 00:05:28.298
Venice, which is right
over here on our map,

00:05:28.298 --> 00:05:32.725
was considered the richest and
most powerful city in Europe.

00:05:32.725 --> 00:05:35.079
Venice has all of this trader wealth

00:05:35.079 --> 00:05:36.813
and it's not just from trade.

00:05:36.813 --> 00:05:39.113
As you might remember
from previous videos,

00:05:39.113 --> 00:05:41.015
when Constantinople was sacked,

00:05:41.015 --> 00:05:44.683
it was sacked in part by
these Venetian traders

00:05:44.683 --> 00:05:47.069
and after that, they built an empire.

00:05:47.069 --> 00:05:48.776
They broke up the Byzantine empire

00:05:48.776 --> 00:05:51.425
and took some of it for themselves.

00:05:51.425 --> 00:05:52.881
And so it's not a coincidence

00:05:52.881 --> 00:05:55.516
that as we get into the
14th and 15th century,

00:05:55.516 --> 00:05:59.017
places like Venice and
Florence, famously sponsored

00:05:59.017 --> 00:06:01.523
by the Medici family, a
famous banking family.

00:06:01.523 --> 00:06:03.614
So once again, these are centers of trade,

00:06:03.614 --> 00:06:06.431
centers of commerce became the places

00:06:06.431 --> 00:06:10.056
where the Renaissance
would first flourish.

00:06:10.056 --> 00:06:14.421
And last but not least,
as in some ways bloody

00:06:14.421 --> 00:06:17.068
and dark a time as the Crusades were,

00:06:17.068 --> 00:06:20.575
they were also associated with learning

00:06:20.575 --> 00:06:23.477
because you had all of these
people go from Western Europe

00:06:23.477 --> 00:06:26.279
to the Middle East and the Holy Land

00:06:26.279 --> 00:06:27.990
and at that time, remember, we have videos

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:30.039
on the Golden Age of Islam.

00:06:30.039 --> 00:06:32.365
In a lot of ways, they were
shepherding the knowledge

00:06:32.365 --> 00:06:35.194
of the Ancient Greeks and the Romans

00:06:35.194 --> 00:06:37.083
and they were merging that with knowledge

00:06:37.083 --> 00:06:38.756
from the Indians and the Chinese

00:06:38.756 --> 00:06:41.908
and also coming up with
innovations on their own.

00:06:41.908 --> 00:06:43.657
And a lot of the Western Europeans

00:06:43.657 --> 00:06:45.990
brought that back to Europe.
