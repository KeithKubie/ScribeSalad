research on charisma shows is that

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:29.800
research on charisma shows is that

are able to be so fully present with
other people and that's what leads to

00:00:36.119 --> 00:00:36.129
other people and that's what leads to
 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:37.830

devices we're constantly receiving
emails and all day long it's as if we

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780
emails and all day long it's as if we
 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.050
emails and all day long it's as if we
were being interrupted from our stream

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060
were being interrupted from our stream
 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.240

a research shows that people who

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550
a research shows that people who
 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.490
a research shows that people who
meditate can increase their attention

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500
meditate can increase their attention
 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.240
meditate can increase their attention
span in fact in some research studies we

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250
span in fact in some research studies we
 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.729
span in fact in some research studies we
use a task called the attentional blink

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739
use a task called the attentional blink
 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:53.220
use a task called the attentional blink
task in which you show people a number

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230
task in which you show people a number

task in which you show people a number
of different images in very fast

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940
of different images in very fast
 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.449
of different images in very fast
sequence and usually we would only pick

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459
sequence and usually we would only pick
 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:59.580
sequence and usually we would only pick
up every fourth image we don't actually

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590
up every fourth image we don't actually
 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.170

attentional blink well research has

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920
attentional blink well research has
 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.190
attentional blink well research has
shown that after meditation retreat

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200
shown that after meditation retreat
 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.590
shown that after meditation retreat
people tend to not show that attentional

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600
people tend to not show that attentional
 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.240
people tend to not show that attentional
blink or to show it less which is very

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250
blink or to show it less which is very
 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.400

interesting means that if we calm our

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410
interesting means that if we calm our
 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.199
interesting means that if we calm our
mind we're somehow able to pick up

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209
mind we're somehow able to pick up
 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:14.910
mind we're somehow able to pick up
things better in our environment which

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920
things better in our environment which

our mind is with regards to multitasking

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810
our mind is with regards to multitasking

our mind is with regards to multitasking
and so forth when our mind is very

we're able to literally see more things

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:25.859
we're able to literally see more things
