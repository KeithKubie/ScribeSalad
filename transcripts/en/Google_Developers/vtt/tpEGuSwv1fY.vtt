PETER HAZLEHURST: Hi.

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:11.530
Good morning.

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:14.490
Wow, super loud.

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.930
I guess everyone's still sort
of reeling from a bit of the

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:18.290
excitement earlier
this morning.

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:22.120
And it's kind of fun to see so
many of you guys here today.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:23.200
I'm Peter Hazlehurst.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.510
I look after the product
management side of our

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:27.370
payments group here at Google.

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:30.800
And I'm really, really excited
to be here with you to talk

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.860
about some of the new things
that are coming from our

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.090
Google Wallet platform and in
particular some of the new

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.670
APIs that we're launching
today.

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.950
What's kind of funny is that
I've been doing this stuff for

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:43.710
almost 20 years now.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.510
And I was reflecting on the fact
that my first piece of

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.770
banking, or payment software
I wrote in 1993.

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.060
And our objective then was to
actually get rid of legacy

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.560
software for mainframes
that was 10 years old.

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.670
And I was talking to my team
who were preparing for a 20

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:00.460
year anniversary.

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:01.770
And the software is
still running.

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:02.680
It's 20 years old.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.330
And now I'm the legacy
developer.

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.000
So it's kind of sad, kind of
fun, and kind of interesting

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.660
at the same time.

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:10.670
But there you go.

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.110
So anyway, it's a pretty
exciting day here at Google.

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:15.600
And there's a lot of
things going on.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.980
And I want to get into some of
the new stuff that we're

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:19.590
bringing to market.

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.480
Just as a little bit of a level
set, one of the things

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:26.270
that we struggle with in
payments is getting people to

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.180
change behavior and adopting
new ideas and new concepts.

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.480
And one of the things that
we've noticed really

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:36.140
interesting lately is the pace
of change in mobile is really

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.100
dramatic and really quick.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.310
One of the things we'd heard
earlier is that people just

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.520
wouldn't use the internet, at
all, for doing financial

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.600
transactions back in
the late '90s.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.510
But that's moved on.

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:48.370
And now pretty much everybody's
using their credit

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:52.690
card and making payments and
doing stuff online these days.

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:54.880
But it's even moving faster in
mobile and that's what's

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.340
really exciting about what we're
doing here with Wallet.

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:58.400
So things are changing.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.370
Things are moving really,
really quickly.

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:03.840
And what's really interesting
is how mobile's changing all

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.130
the different ways we interact
and how we work together.

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.509
I think, perhaps, most
personally is

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.320
the bathroom usage.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.690
And at our house we made sure
we had Wi-Fi access points

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.680
with good range so that we could
do work and keep going

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.760
at the same time.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.730
But it's pretty interesting.

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.200
As part of the Payments team,
one of the things we try and

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.790
optimize for is making
sure that the

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.330
phones work in stores.

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.610
And that you can have a great
experience shopping and

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.980
looking for things and
purchasing stuff.

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.050
And what's unique about what
we're doing is we're starting

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.560
to see an incredible number of
people looking for discounts,

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.870
and coupons, and offers, and
savings, and things like that

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.500
with their phones.

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.590
And so what's nice is that's
level setter, it's a stage

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.850
setting for some of the work
we did and why we brought

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.730
Google Wallet into the market.

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.350
So Google Wallet is, as many
as you guys know, an

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.150
opportunity for the consumer
to use their

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.860
phone to make a payment.

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.100
And we thought that the best way
to do that was to couple

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.630
things with NFC, where we
actually have the ability to

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.090
see and experience in real time
a connection from the

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.410
phone to the terminal and
out into the cloud

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.130
to make things happen.

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.190
Google Wallet's been going
really, really great.

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.770
We're really excited about
our progress today.

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:22.070
And as part of this objective
our first and foremost goal

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:25.390
was to kick-start an ecosystem
and to get things going.

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.390
We were the first guys
to make it happen.

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:30.950
And it's kind of fun to see a
bunch of our colleagues in the

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:33.310
industry starting to catch on
to what seems like a pretty

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.240
good idea of making payments and
doing fun things with your

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:39.690
cell phone, as a way to do
commerce and things like that

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.090
around the internet.

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.360
So thinking about why this
is so hard and what the

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:46.650
challenges are.

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.810
It's important to realize
how many players get to

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.770
participate in the ecosystem and
how many different sorts

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:56.090
of guys have a role
in what we do.

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:59.100
And the real challenge here is,
as part of Google Wallet,

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.230
we have to bring all of these
teams together to agree on

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:05.080
standards, to agree on how
transactions should process,

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:06.890
to make things work together.

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:07.740
And it's nontrivial.

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:10.580
Because everybody thinks
they own the customer.

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:12.540
And every one thinks
the user is theirs.

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.980
And at Google we fundamentally
believe you are the user and

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:17.300
you get to choose.

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:19.130
Which is why it's kind of
exciting to see a little bit

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.840
more competition
in the market.

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.710
And people are more interested
in giving different ways of

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:26.920
paying with things.

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.520
But it's nice to see that
there's opportunity for lots

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.970
of different people to
participate in the ecosystem

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.890
and still create great value
for the consumer.

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:37.830
But don't underestimate how
difficult this is to get

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:40.110
everybody from the banks to
the people that make the

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.150
phones to the retailers to put
all of their different systems

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.960
together and make it work.

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.290
So talking a little bit about
momentum, as I think you guys

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:50.590
heard in the keynote.

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:52.520
One of the things we're really,
really proud of is the

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.920
acceleration of NFC
in the real world.

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:57.480
And to give you a sense of what
that looks like, when we

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.535
kicked this thing off and we
started thinking about Google

00:04:59.535 --> 00:05:02.380
Wallet back in 2010, there was
a pretty small number of

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:05.265
phones out there and a pretty
small number of terminals.

00:05:05.265 --> 00:05:07.970
I actually remember working at
Nokia when we launched one of

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:10.790
the first NFC phones
back in 2004.

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:12.890
And right then we thought
the world was

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:13.750
going to take on fire.

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:15.720
It was going to be three years
and there'd be tens of

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.350
millions of phones out there.

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:19.160
Didn't quite happen so much.

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.120
But what I'm really, really
excited to reemphasize is

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.990
we're now launching and adapting
more than a million

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:27.550
NFC phones a week.

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:29.950
So the ecosystems growing really
fast and the rate of

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:32.290
growth is even faster than
you would imagine.

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:34.350
You can see the number of
terminals that are available

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:37.110
on a worldwide basis is growing
really, really fast.

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:39.370
And we're really excited about
the fact that there's going to

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:42.280
be so many more places that you
can use your phone to make

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:45.280
a payment and have things
just work beautifully.

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:47.730
In the last two quarters we've
launched six new phones

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:49.050
powered by Google Wallet.

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:50.570
And that's really exciting.

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:54.230
And we think we've got tons more
exciting products that

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:57.550
are coming out towards
the end of this year.

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:01.370
So I guess the next thing is,
How have we been going?

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:02.940
What have we been doing?

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:05.760
In Google Wallet there's been a
bunch of excitement, a bunch

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:09.550
of adapting, and listening to
consumers and to you the

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:12.640
developers, and everybody out
there with our products.

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:16.040
We pushed out 14 revisions in
nine months, largely in

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:18.900
response to a bunch of consumer
feedback of wanting

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:21.440
to get better value out of their
phone and integrating

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:22.970
offers into the service.

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:25.190
We added a whole bunch of new
features and capabilities

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:29.110
around transaction history and
support of different sorts of

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:30.980
experiences in the store.

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:33.620
We listened and we learned to
the complexity of making sure

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:37.250
that the point-of-sale devices
actually work, in reality

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:39.050
versus just in theory.

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:41.640
And you just won't believe the
number of challenges from the

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:44.760
fact that some of the devices,
while they have power on,

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:46.490
aren't actually connected
to anything.

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:48.350
And so we had people tapping
their phones and saying,

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:49.570
What's going on?

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:52.810
And literally, it was like this,
connected with power but

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:55.270
not actually connected to
anything on the other side.

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:57.850
So we've built a lot of smarts
into the app to react to those

00:06:57.850 --> 00:06:58.940
situations.

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:01.150
And as a result the ability for
payments to come through

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:03.410
our system is improving
day by day.

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:06.320
We've also listened and
adapted to the various

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:08.680
concerns around the security
of our product.

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:11.090
And we still feel very, very
confident that this is the

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:14.230
safest way to pay and the best
solution for you as an end

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:17.850
user to make payments
in the industry.

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:20.780
But what we wanted to do then,
just very quickly, is give you

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:22.970
a sense of how's this going
with consumers.

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:26.040
So we set up an event where we
gave people a chance to try

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:26.950
Google Wallet.

00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:28.810
And this is a little bit of the
real-time feedback we've

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:30.250
heard from them.

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:30.740
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:31.070
-I can't wait.

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:32.536
I am so excited about this.

00:07:32.536 --> 00:07:32.984
This is like--

00:07:32.984 --> 00:07:33.880
I'm gonna do it.

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:34.330
I'm gonna do it.

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:34.870
-Wow.

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:35.704
-Look at that.

00:07:35.704 --> 00:07:36.540
-Oh my gosh.

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:39.313
It's so cool.

00:07:39.313 --> 00:07:42.259
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:42.259 --> 00:07:43.509
-Wow.

00:07:48.151 --> 00:07:50.606
-[INAUDIBLE].

00:07:50.606 --> 00:07:51.588
-OMG!

00:07:51.588 --> 00:07:53.061
OMG!

00:07:53.061 --> 00:07:55.050
[LAUGHS]

00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:56.300
Thank you Google Wallet.

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:02.020
PETER HAZLEHURST: So the
exciting thing is, and what we

00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:04.120
keen to do here at Google is
make sure we have magical

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:06.010
experiences with consumers.

00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:08.580
And what we were getting out of
Google Wallet is this sense

00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:09.970
that we're starting to deliver
on some of the

00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:11.650
benefits to the consumer.

00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:14.790
That we can help them save money
by discovering and using

00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:16.030
existing deals.

00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:17.900
We're giving them a way to store
all of their loyalty

00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:19.640
cards and payment cards
in the cloud.

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:21.050
We're giving them the financial

00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:22.060
control that they want.

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:24.400
And just this whole beautiful
experience of when you tap

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:26.880
your phone, the payment
just works.

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:30.430
But the challenge for us is
dealing with concerns the

00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:32.799
consumers have around security,
and also dealing

00:08:32.799 --> 00:08:35.500
with the fact that it doesn't
necessarily work everywhere.

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:37.669
And so this is part of what
we're trying to solve with

00:08:37.669 --> 00:08:40.740
Google Wallet and some of the
new things we're doing.

00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:43.549
And one of the things we've
started to do as we've adapted

00:08:43.549 --> 00:08:46.250
to the market, is adapt
to the fact that real

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:47.540
world is really important.

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:49.310
But people have told us they
want to use their Wallet

00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:50.030
everywhere.

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:52.520
So we've pushed everything
up into the cloud.

00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:55.270
Google Wallet in the cloud is
now available so that you can

00:08:55.270 --> 00:08:58.370
do purchases all throughout
Google, on Play, Chrome Store.

00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:01.720
You can buy books, you can buy
music, you can buy games.

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:04.380
And it's also now available on
merchant sites, and in-app

00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:06.550
payments, and other sorts
of solutions.

00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:08.760
And you can see a little bit
more demo of some of the new

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:10.430
stuff we're doing with
in-app payments

00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:12.160
later on this afternoon.

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:14.730
Fundamentally, everything you
do with Google Wallet is

00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:17.270
stored in the cloud, made
available across all the

00:09:17.270 --> 00:09:20.100
places we make Google
available.

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:22.330
So going forward we said to
ourselves, There must be

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:24.820
another solution and
another concern.

00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:27.140
And the question is, How do you
store things like coupons

00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:30.105
and tickets and gift cards and
all of these other things that

00:09:30.105 --> 00:09:32.180
you keep track of in
your daily life?

00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:34.550
And that's where we started
to evolve Google.

00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:37.130
And what we wanted to start to
focus in on is, How do I keep

00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:38.690
track of all of this
information?

00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:41.500
And how do I make it easy
to save it in my wallet?

00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:43.540
And that's what we're here
to talk about right now.

00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:45.750
So we're talking about a new
feature, a new capability

00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:47.520
called Save-to-Wallet.

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:50.290
And Save-to-Wallet is a part
of our platform, our open

00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:53.610
ecosystem, that makes it
possible for you as an end

00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:56.210
user to save different pieces of
content that you see around

00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:57.880
the net to your Wallet.

00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:00.665
And then use it in different
places wherever you go.

00:10:00.665 --> 00:10:03.550
The implementation of which
we're offering right now is

00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:05.300
two key APIs.

00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:07.840
First of all, for saving
offers to your Wallet.

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:10.710
This is the ability to go on
any website, anywhere, and

00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:13.860
save a discount or coupon
or some sort of savings.

00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:15.140
Store it in the Wallet.

00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:18.570
And if you need to, you can show
and scan and make it easy

00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:20.600
for the cashier to
receive it or.

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:23.790
Or If you're a merchant, and you
know you support NFC, you

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:25.730
can actually also
save NFC-related

00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:27.280
offers to your Wallet.

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:28.510
So this is kind of exciting.

00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:30.510
And then we're also launching
Save to Wallet for payment

00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:31.810
cards, which is even
more interesting.

00:10:31.810 --> 00:10:34.350
But we'll get to that
in a second.

00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:36.470
So let's talk about
Save-to-Wallet for offers.

00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:39.380
In the past, we've had a pretty
easy model for our own

00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:43.250
teams at Google to support
putting discounts and savings

00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:44.000
in your Wallet.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.980
And that's been working
really, really well.

00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:48.770
But what we're excited about
right now is the ability for

00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:50.380
you guys to offer the
ability to save

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:52.040
things on your websites.

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:55.280
Or as merchants, you could save
it on your website, too,

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:58.580
and get it out into your
Wallet and then be used

00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:01.100
elsewhere across the internet.

00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:02.110
Why would you want to do that?

00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:04.265
Because it's a frictionless way
of saving these offers to

00:11:04.265 --> 00:11:05.150
your Wallet.

00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:07.530
It makes it really, really easy
to redeem them and show

00:11:07.530 --> 00:11:10.620
them onto the merchant and
make a transaction flow.

00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:12.600
And we're pretty confident about
the redemption side of

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:14.630
things, that it's going
to work great.

00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:17.360
So what I'm going to do now is
give you a bit of a demo of

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:19.660
how this looks as an end
consumer and set things up a

00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:20.910
little bit here.

00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:25.250
There we go.

00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:25.820
All right.

00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:27.070
So here's the deal.

00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:32.830
Some of you may know, I have
just been blessed with twins

00:11:32.830 --> 00:11:34.450
about 18 months ago.

00:11:34.450 --> 00:11:36.970
And believe it or not, my wife
who's never seen Star Wars

00:11:36.970 --> 00:11:39.010
named them Luke and Leia.

00:11:39.010 --> 00:11:44.460
And so Luke and Leia, my two
kids, are particularly fond of

00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:46.670
pies and cakes and
stuff like that.

00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:48.780
And I fancy myself as
a bit of a baker.

00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:52.250
So I'm pretty keen to go
shopping and doing baking and

00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:53.140
stuff like that.

00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:56.195
So imagine here I am,
on allrecipes.com.

00:11:56.195 --> 00:12:00.340
And I found this awesome example
of a pie that I might

00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:01.550
want to make.

00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:03.700
And you know what?

00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:07.060
I was kind of in trouble a
little bit, because I turned

00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:11.840
40 and I think life is sort of
coming on the down slope.

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:13.970
And it was kind of interesting,
so I was thinking

00:12:13.970 --> 00:12:18.010
to myself, I don't really have
time to make a cake.

00:12:18.010 --> 00:12:20.080
The team's keeping
me pretty busy.

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:21.660
So how about this?

00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:24.590
There's an offer here for some
awesome Biscoff cookies.

00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:27.160
So I'm going to click
on that offer.

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:30.350
And what you can see here is an
offer being presented out

00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:32.630
of the Walgreen's website.

00:12:32.630 --> 00:12:34.820
And we're really excited about
working with Walgreen's and

00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:36.180
Biscoff to make this offer.

00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:38.420
And so you can see here, it's a
pretty standard offer with a

00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:40.210
bunch of capabilities.

00:12:40.210 --> 00:12:43.320
And sitting down at the bottom
is this cool button called

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:45.111
Save-to-Wallet.

00:12:45.111 --> 00:12:48.690
And all you do is you click on
the Save-to-Wallet button.

00:12:48.690 --> 00:12:50.770
Not exactly rocket science.

00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:52.310
And as an end user, that's it.

00:12:52.310 --> 00:12:52.680
Done.

00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:54.710
Done and dusted.

00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:56.900
And then you say, Well,
now what I do with it?

00:12:56.900 --> 00:12:59.070
Well, I should have
got an email here.

00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:00.180
Excellent.

00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:02.390
So you get a bit of a
notification that something's

00:13:02.390 --> 00:13:03.640
happened in your Wallet.

00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:08.300
And for what it's worth
these are real offers.

00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:11.670
So if any of you guys have
Galaxy Nexuses, or other NFC

00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:16.070
phones, you can tap the offer
downstairs and get a free

00:13:16.070 --> 00:13:18.630
awesome set of cookies.

00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:21.430
And then what happens is if
you go into your Wallet.

00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:23.180
And remember that whole
thing how we're nice

00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:24.140
and safe and secure?

00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:30.790
So I'm going to put in my PIN,
which you guys can now have.

00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:32.190
This is not my phone.

00:13:32.190 --> 00:13:34.570
My phone is over there.

00:13:34.570 --> 00:13:36.460
I don't how many of you guys
have seen this stuff before.

00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:38.290
So I'll just quickly browse
through a little bit of the

00:13:38.290 --> 00:13:39.010
capabilities.

00:13:39.010 --> 00:13:43.180
Google Wallet lets you have
things like credit cards, and

00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:44.900
we also have a prepaid
gift card.

00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:48.280
We can also store all the gift
cards in there as well.

00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:49.710
We have rewards support.

00:13:49.710 --> 00:13:52.840
So you can store all your fancy
reward cards that you

00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:55.340
use all the time,
loyalty cards.

00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:56.250
We have transactions.

00:13:56.250 --> 00:13:57.530
And let me show you
about the offers.

00:13:57.530 --> 00:14:00.893
So here you can see I've
got the NFC offer here.

00:14:00.893 --> 00:14:03.260
You can see it's enabled
for NFC.

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:05.220
Do you guys see that?

00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:09.520
And I have nothing more to do
than to-- imagine here I am

00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:12.140
walking into the store.

00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:14.730
I make a payment.

00:14:14.730 --> 00:14:19.220
And you hear the beautiful
little W. Oops, sorry, a

00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:20.750
little bit off the screen.

00:14:20.750 --> 00:14:21.400
And there you go.

00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:24.220
So what happened was transaction
was transmitted

00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:24.750
from my phone.

00:14:24.750 --> 00:14:26.380
The offer was present.

00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:27.560
The merchant accepted it.

00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:29.460
I've got a nice little
geolocation on where the

00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:31.010
[INAUDIBLE] transaction
occurred.

00:14:31.010 --> 00:14:33.730
I could write a note.

00:14:33.730 --> 00:14:38.080
Give to the kids.

00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:39.710
This is not running Jelly Bean,
which is why it doesn't

00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:40.960
do the predictions.

00:14:42.950 --> 00:14:45.270
All right.

00:14:45.270 --> 00:14:45.970
And that was it.

00:14:45.970 --> 00:14:47.740
Super, super simple.

00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:51.120
So that Save-to-Wallet button
can exist anywhere on the web.

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:54.410
And it will save it into a
Google user's account.

00:14:54.410 --> 00:14:57.340
And then can be redeemed
throughout the web.

00:14:57.340 --> 00:14:59.910
To prove that this was actually
working and to prove

00:14:59.910 --> 00:15:05.510
that there's proof of life of
Luke and Leia, I actually did

00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:08.320
an end-to-end test of the
product, including live

00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:09.420
redemption.

00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:12.590
And you can see Leia there
munching away on the cookie

00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:14.170
with here Google-branded
sweatshirt

00:15:14.170 --> 00:15:16.930
on, which is awesome.

00:15:16.930 --> 00:15:19.630
The dog is in the background,
he ate most of them.

00:15:19.630 --> 00:15:22.190
Anyway, so to give you a sense
of what this is, it's really,

00:15:22.190 --> 00:15:23.870
really simple.

00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:25.370
All you need to do is
drop in the button

00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:27.130
snippet on your web page.

00:15:27.130 --> 00:15:29.590
If as an end user you weren't
logged in to Google.

00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:32.250
And if you weren't running
Chrome, shame on you.

00:15:32.250 --> 00:15:34.740
But if, in fact, you weren't
running on Chrome, it will pop

00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:35.350
up a Google login.

00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:37.570
So say if you're
on your iPhone.

00:15:37.570 --> 00:15:39.340
We're gonna then drop
in a proxy iframe.

00:15:39.340 --> 00:15:43.445
We're going to log in and get
a cross-site scripting token

00:15:43.445 --> 00:15:46.270
to make sure we're not getting
hacked and so forth.

00:15:46.270 --> 00:15:47.670
And it's a simple API call.

00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:49.350
And you're done.

00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:51.940
It's really, really,
really easy.

00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:53.870
And this is the critical
point.

00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:55.890
What does it look like from
a code perspective?

00:15:55.890 --> 00:15:58.210
Drop in the JavaScript.

00:15:58.210 --> 00:16:00.140
Easy, easy.

00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:01.840
Tell us a little bit about what
the offer is that you

00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:05.640
want to do, in a minimal,
rendable format.

00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:06.960
Pretty easy.

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:10.050
Indicate whether you want us
to do something over NFC.

00:16:10.050 --> 00:16:11.690
And I'll show you what a
show-and-scan version of that

00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:13.810
looks like.

00:16:13.810 --> 00:16:16.030
And tell us a little bit about
yourself, where's the

00:16:16.030 --> 00:16:18.660
information?

00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:19.900
And then at the bottom,
don't forget to put

00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:22.340
the button on there.

00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:24.630
There's nothing else
to it guys.

00:16:24.630 --> 00:16:26.365
If you guys can't code
this in half a day,

00:16:26.365 --> 00:16:29.090
there's something wrong.

00:16:29.090 --> 00:16:32.180
And just in case you wanted
to do a QR code, or

00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:34.980
show-and-scan, under the type
code you just enter that

00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:36.250
information.

00:16:36.250 --> 00:16:39.710
Very, very easy.

00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:40.650
That's it.

00:16:40.650 --> 00:16:42.270
That's how you save an
offer to the Wallet.

00:16:42.270 --> 00:16:44.250
You make it super,
super smart.

00:16:44.250 --> 00:16:48.210
And what we've suddenly done
there is made it possible for

00:16:48.210 --> 00:16:50.645
anybody to put information
into the Wallet.

00:16:50.645 --> 00:16:54.370
This is part of a whole suite
of APIs that we're doing to

00:16:54.370 --> 00:16:57.360
open up the Wallet.

00:16:57.360 --> 00:16:59.980
Perhaps more interestingly, is
the fact that we're also

00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:03.060
offering Save-to-Wallet
for payment cards.

00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:04.450
And so think about this.

00:17:04.450 --> 00:17:09.390
Right now, we have millions and
millions of users creating

00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:11.020
Wallets throughout the internet
for things like

00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:13.619
Google Play and so forth.

00:17:13.619 --> 00:17:16.720
And one of the things that we
hear back from them is it's

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:19.839
kind of a pain to add their
credit card information and

00:17:19.839 --> 00:17:22.480
make sure it's kept up-to-date
with their bank.

00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:25.359
In our app, we'll actually
disable a card that gets

00:17:25.359 --> 00:17:27.329
expired, things like that.

00:17:27.329 --> 00:17:29.960
And so what we tried to do is
think about how could we do

00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:31.720
this better and different.

00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:33.290
And we've tested this out.

00:17:33.290 --> 00:17:35.650
And most people are really,
really comfortable logging

00:17:35.650 --> 00:17:38.570
into online banking and to their
credit card websites and

00:17:38.570 --> 00:17:39.610
things like that.

00:17:39.610 --> 00:17:41.330
And we said to ourselves, Well,
if their already logged

00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:43.200
into online banking, why don't
we take the idea of

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:46.730
Save-to-Wallet and put it
inside online banking?

00:17:46.730 --> 00:17:49.870
So for example, we've partnered
up with Discover to

00:17:49.870 --> 00:17:54.090
make a first example of how
this is going to work.

00:17:54.090 --> 00:17:56.740
And the concept here is
really simple, again.

00:17:56.740 --> 00:17:59.370
The focus is on a very, very
easy lightweight button that

00:17:59.370 --> 00:18:02.460
you can drop in to your app,
or into your website, that

00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:05.460
allows information about credit
cards and and other

00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:06.960
sorts of payment instruments
to be pushed

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:09.040
into the Google Wallet.

00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:13.750
So let's have a look at what
that does and how it works.

00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:14.520
Why would you do it?

00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:17.160
Obviously, because it's easy
to get to as a user.

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:20.050
And one of the things we heard
from our banking partners is

00:18:20.050 --> 00:18:21.700
getting information into
Google Wallet has

00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:23.040
been hard in the past.

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:26.700
So we wanted to simplify
things tremendously.

00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:32.550
So let me go to my awesome
new Nexus 7.

00:18:32.550 --> 00:18:35.830
And in the spirit of, somewhat
of proof, I'm gonna go to

00:18:35.830 --> 00:18:38.546
Google Wallet and make sure--

00:18:38.546 --> 00:18:41.160
I don't exactly have one, this
is the true demo test.

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:42.640
You can see the login
thing over here.

00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:53.630
OK.

00:18:53.630 --> 00:18:56.470
So we should be logged in.

00:18:56.470 --> 00:18:59.000
And, oops, there we go.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:00.250
Let's have a look at
my payment methods.

00:19:02.865 --> 00:19:06.670
And you can see a bunch of
credit cards, lots of

00:19:06.670 --> 00:19:07.510
different sorts of things.

00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:09.200
And no, it's not my
full card number.

00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:12.770
So no, you can't go make
transactions on my behalf.

00:19:12.770 --> 00:19:14.910
But you can see, clearly,
no Discover card.

00:19:14.910 --> 00:19:17.620
So I'm going to go
to Discover.

00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:20.290
And you can see they have
a secure card log on.

00:19:20.290 --> 00:19:22.445
I will give you my user
name, just in case you

00:19:22.445 --> 00:19:23.790
wanted to do that.

00:19:23.790 --> 00:19:25.030
But I'm going to
take the camera

00:19:25.030 --> 00:19:27.850
off-screen for a second.

00:19:27.850 --> 00:19:29.100
Trust but verify.

00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:35.130
And for those of you knew me
from Yodlee, the password is

00:19:35.130 --> 00:19:36.380
not topsecret1.

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:40.360
OK.

00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:41.030
There we go.

00:19:41.030 --> 00:19:42.280
So I'm gonna log in now.

00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:46.820
All right.

00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:48.480
And then what I'm going
to do is I'm gonna go

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:49.860
over to this new tab.

00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:51.380
So sorry, just to make sure.

00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:53.080
Couple of credit cards,
a few little

00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:55.130
transactions here and there.

00:19:55.130 --> 00:19:57.820
I'm going to go to a new tab.

00:19:57.820 --> 00:20:00.940
Now I'm gonna go and add
this in a new tab.

00:20:05.224 --> 00:20:08.146
Let's hopefully do that.

00:20:08.146 --> 00:20:09.562
Oh.

00:20:09.562 --> 00:20:10.812
Can you feel it?

00:20:13.442 --> 00:20:15.390
Let's see here.

00:20:15.390 --> 00:20:16.851
Oh there we go.

00:20:16.851 --> 00:20:17.670
OK.

00:20:17.670 --> 00:20:18.960
So you can see here,
right, we've got a

00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:21.200
landing page from Discover.

00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:25.390
And the reason we're using this
local address is just so

00:20:25.390 --> 00:20:27.260
you guys don't hack the
new URL, which isn't

00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:29.090
quite public yet.

00:20:29.090 --> 00:20:30.510
But it is for reals.

00:20:30.510 --> 00:20:33.030
and you can see here, as a bank
or an issuer you get the

00:20:33.030 --> 00:20:35.460
opportunity to put some
marketing information up, like

00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:39.130
what is it, why would I do it,
what saves me time and money,

00:20:39.130 --> 00:20:40.610
and where can I shop.

00:20:40.610 --> 00:20:44.010
This is sort of an indicator of
how to use Google Wallet.

00:20:44.010 --> 00:20:46.380
But I'm going to hit
Add Your Card.

00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:49.645
And hopefully it's going
to then ask me, Do

00:20:49.645 --> 00:20:52.740
I want to log in?

00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:55.160
And what it's actually doing
here is it's asking me as an

00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:58.310
end user, Do I give permission
from Google to Discover to

00:20:58.310 --> 00:21:01.350
talk to my account through
open authentication?

00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:03.280
So as an end user, you're
always in charge.

00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:04.460
And this is the critical
point.

00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:05.920
So we say, Yeah, I'm
going to do that.

00:21:08.470 --> 00:21:12.710
And we log in.

00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:15.690
And there we go, done, pretty
straightforward.

00:21:15.690 --> 00:21:17.590
Theoretically I got a message.

00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:19.680
I also got some Google+
messages, awesome.

00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:23.780
There we go.

00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:26.730
You can see I added my card to
my Wallet, great opportunity

00:21:26.730 --> 00:21:28.870
for banks and issuers to
message back to their

00:21:28.870 --> 00:21:31.920
consumers about what's
going on.

00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:37.170
And let's go over to Play and
just prove that everything

00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:39.610
made it all the way through.

00:21:39.610 --> 00:21:41.560
I think you guys saw some of
the new movies and TV.

00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:43.160
So let's go and see what
we've got to buy.

00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:47.690
Loading, loading, loading.

00:21:50.494 --> 00:21:54.220
Let's buy some new TV show.

00:21:57.810 --> 00:21:59.340
I haven't seen The
Walking Dead.

00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:01.190
So let's buy the whole season,
see what happens.

00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:08.660
Why would you watch it in less
than HD on your new Nexus 7?

00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:09.270
OK.

00:22:09.270 --> 00:22:11.080
And we're going to do a little
bit of work here getting a

00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:14.720
list of all my credit cards and
all of that sort of thing.

00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:17.020
Taking a few seconds.

00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:20.600
And I'm going to go
to my Discover.

00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:22.860
And I Accept and Buy.

00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:25.980
And that was it.

00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:27.150
Really, really lightweight.

00:22:27.150 --> 00:22:28.430
Really, really simple.

00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:31.890
And we just did something that
has sort of confounded the

00:22:31.890 --> 00:22:33.420
industry for ages and ages.

00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:36.090
How do you share information
safely and securely between a

00:22:36.090 --> 00:22:40.290
bank or a credit card issuer
and a third party Wallet,

00:22:40.290 --> 00:22:42.580
which is what Google
Wallet is?

00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:44.840
All with the trust, and all with
the control, in the hands

00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:45.360
of the user.

00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:48.090
Not in the hands of the bank,
not in the hands of anybody

00:22:48.090 --> 00:22:50.230
else but the user in charge.

00:22:50.230 --> 00:22:51.580
How does it work?

00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:53.000
Exactly the same way--

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:56.090
oh, slide [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:56.090 --> 00:22:58.230
There we go.

00:22:58.230 --> 00:23:00.870
So we basically saw I was logged
in to online banking,

00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:02.890
pretty straightforward.

00:23:02.890 --> 00:23:05.030
We do a little bit of
extra OAuth setup.

00:23:05.030 --> 00:23:06.900
So this is putting the
user in control.

00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:09.920
So unlike saving a coupon,
or a cookie, or

00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:11.030
something like that--

00:23:11.030 --> 00:23:13.040
we pretty much think saving
a cookie is a

00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:14.570
safe sort of action.

00:23:14.570 --> 00:23:17.260
Pushing credit cards, things
like that, a little bit more

00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:18.290
user control needed.

00:23:18.290 --> 00:23:20.870
So we'll give that
to the user.

00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:24.640
We authorize the token and then
it's very, very simple.

00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:27.450
Again, you package up the
information you want to send

00:23:27.450 --> 00:23:30.100
to Google and send
it off to us.

00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:31.670
So what's it look like?

00:23:31.670 --> 00:23:34.420
Again, simplicity
is the key here.

00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:36.950
A little bit of code here
in an example in Python.

00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:38.470
So for those of you
keeping track on

00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:40.420
different language styles.

00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:44.550
Get some security encryption
stuff set up, no big deal.

00:23:44.550 --> 00:23:46.030
Tell us what you're
going to do.

00:23:46.030 --> 00:23:48.200
So we need to get information
about what type of card you're

00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:49.220
going to add to the Wallet.

00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:51.550
Whether it's a credit
card, or debit card,

00:23:51.550 --> 00:23:52.290
or things like that.

00:23:52.290 --> 00:23:54.070
What sort of type
of card it is.

00:23:54.070 --> 00:23:55.550
You'll notice that we're
actually pretty keen on

00:23:55.550 --> 00:23:56.970
encrypting the card data.

00:23:56.970 --> 00:23:59.860
So if you send us card number
information that's not

00:23:59.860 --> 00:24:02.420
encrypted, we're going
to barf on that.

00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:04.600
And then we give you a little
bit of opportunity to put some

00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:07.320
information around last four
digits, expiration

00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:07.930
date, and so on.

00:24:07.930 --> 00:24:10.260
That's what shows up in the
clear for the user.

00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:11.900
So that if they have lots of
cards in their Wallet they

00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:14.400
know which one to pick.

00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:17.410
And then very, very simple,
send us the request.

00:24:17.410 --> 00:24:19.400
And get the response.

00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:22.820
It falls into the one-to-two
days of integration time

00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:26.640
versus the six-to-12 months
traditional integration time

00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:30.340
for a credit card issuer or a
bank connecting to Google.

00:24:30.340 --> 00:24:34.200
We think this is a huge, huge
enabler and a way for

00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:36.230
consumers to get more
information stored in their

00:24:36.230 --> 00:24:38.240
Wallet in a safe and secure
way, where they

00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:40.960
get to control things.

00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:44.560
So you can imagine that this
sort of first step with offers

00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:47.730
and payment cards isn't the end
of where we're going with

00:24:47.730 --> 00:24:49.030
Save-to-Wallet.

00:24:49.030 --> 00:24:53.270
And you should watch closely
for new and exciting other

00:24:53.270 --> 00:24:55.580
sorts of content that you can
save into your Wallet really,

00:24:55.580 --> 00:24:56.780
really soon.

00:24:56.780 --> 00:24:59.670
We think that increasing the
ability for consumers to get

00:24:59.670 --> 00:25:02.630
offers in their Wallet is
a key benefit for them.

00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:04.780
And we know that you guys have
a lot of content that you'd

00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:07.340
like to push to them, in terms
of savings and discounts.

00:25:07.340 --> 00:25:09.750
But then going forward, adding
the payment cards is one of

00:25:09.750 --> 00:25:15.500
the key barriers that we're
going to lift that makes it

00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:17.485
much easier for the consumer to
start getting their Wallet

00:25:17.485 --> 00:25:19.240
and be active with it.

00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:22.500
And that's one of the key
things we're focused on.

00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:25.090
So, again, this is where
we are today.

00:25:25.090 --> 00:25:27.080
We've got a whole bunch of other
stuff that we're going

00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:29.650
to talk about later on related
to commerce and

00:25:29.650 --> 00:25:31.340
other aspects of Google.

00:25:31.340 --> 00:25:34.020
And we've also got a bunch of
new, exciting announcements

00:25:34.020 --> 00:25:37.290
around digital goods that's
coming towards this afternoon.

00:25:37.290 --> 00:25:40.520
And we're happy to come and
redeem some free cookies for

00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:42.210
you later on.

00:25:42.210 --> 00:25:43.360
So thanks for your time.

00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:45.030
Very short and sweet,
like the APIs.

00:25:45.030 --> 00:25:47.870
Wanted to make it easy for
you to both consume the

00:25:47.870 --> 00:25:49.740
information in this
session and almost

00:25:49.740 --> 00:25:50.660
get you back on schedule.

00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:53.440
So got a few minutes for
questions if you guys have

00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:55.520
anything you want to.

00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:56.349
Thank you.

00:25:56.349 --> 00:26:02.097
[APPLAUSE]

00:26:02.097 --> 00:26:02.576
PETER HAZLEHURST: Hi.

00:26:02.576 --> 00:26:03.410
That was quick.

00:26:03.410 --> 00:26:04.420
AUDIENCE: I have a
quick question.

00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:06.560
You showed how easy it
was to add a coupon.

00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:10.830
Can the business follow
the follow through?

00:26:10.830 --> 00:26:12.120
Where's the analytics on that?

00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:14.620
Would it be part of
like the Google Ad

00:26:14.620 --> 00:26:16.170
dashboard or something?

00:26:16.170 --> 00:26:16.700
PETER HAZLEHURST: I'm sorry.

00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:17.870
I didn't quite understand
the question.

00:26:17.870 --> 00:26:21.160
AUDIENCE: So how can a business
track how many people

00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:22.350
use those coupons?

00:26:22.350 --> 00:26:22.890
Is there anything like that?

00:26:22.890 --> 00:26:23.490
PETER HAZLEHURST: Oh I see
what you're saying.

00:26:23.490 --> 00:26:23.710
Yeah.

00:26:23.710 --> 00:26:26.950
So there's an Offers setup
dashboard that allows you to

00:26:26.950 --> 00:26:29.790
see all the different coupons
and offers that you've made.

00:26:29.790 --> 00:26:31.540
If you're doing it on Google
and through Google.

00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:33.100
But otherwise you're just
going to get redemption

00:26:33.100 --> 00:26:36.241
signals sent back to
you afterwards.

00:26:36.241 --> 00:26:37.455
Yeah, Hi.

00:26:37.455 --> 00:26:40.270
AUDIENCE: Hi, oh sorry.

00:26:40.270 --> 00:26:44.380
I also work with
the Paypal API.

00:26:44.380 --> 00:26:47.550
And I'm wondering if anybody
here, because I don't think

00:26:47.550 --> 00:26:50.220
this is a question for you,
but maybe there's some--

00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:54.100
Remember Google Checkout
had an API, too, right?

00:26:54.100 --> 00:26:59.690
And Paypal allows a developer
to make a payment.

00:26:59.690 --> 00:27:02.200
And some of it goes to
developers some of it goes to

00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:05.730
the company, like a
three-way deal.

00:27:05.730 --> 00:27:09.830
And Google Checkout doesn't
seem to have that ability.

00:27:09.830 --> 00:27:13.400
So I'm wondering if I could ask
someone, is there any old

00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:16.123
Google Checkout API
people around?

00:27:16.123 --> 00:27:17.540
PETER HAZLEHURST: I actually
don't know if there are any

00:27:17.540 --> 00:27:18.170
old Google Checkout people--

00:27:18.170 --> 00:27:20.800
AUDIENCE: Or not old,
but I think--

00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:22.670
PETER HAZLEHURST: I think the
focus is let's look on what

00:27:22.670 --> 00:27:24.730
the new stuff that we're
making possible.

00:27:24.730 --> 00:27:27.280
And in particular things like
in-app payments which may be a

00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:29.240
solution to things you need.

00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:31.090
And if you want to come to our
session, or come to our

00:27:31.090 --> 00:27:32.633
sandbox, we'd be happy to
talk to you in more

00:27:32.633 --> 00:27:32.820
detail about that.

00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:33.190
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:27:33.190 --> 00:27:33.960
Thank you.

00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:36.870
PETER HAZLEHURST:
Thanks Yes, sir.

00:27:36.870 --> 00:27:37.220
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:38.985
Where exactly the information
is stored?

00:27:38.985 --> 00:27:40.430
Is it on your cloud?

00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:42.410
I mean, all those credit card
details and everything?

00:27:42.410 --> 00:27:43.110
PETER HAZLEHURST: Yeah,
great question.

00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:46.760
So the information is stored
in the cloud and stored in

00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:48.350
Google data centers
around the world.

00:27:48.350 --> 00:27:51.630
And so that's how we can make
it available throughout all

00:27:51.630 --> 00:27:53.990
the different places where
Google Wallet is

00:27:53.990 --> 00:27:55.570
made for end users.

00:28:03.090 --> 00:28:04.870
AUDIENCE: Could we get a
physical printout of all the

00:28:04.870 --> 00:28:07.560
offers you saved in
the Google Wallet?

00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:08.440
PETER HAZLEHURST:
As an end user?

00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:09.380
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:28:09.380 --> 00:28:11.160
Just to go to stores
and redeem them?

00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:13.730
Like, all the Walgreen's
coupons, or--

00:28:13.730 --> 00:28:14.800
PETER HAZLEHURST: So I'm pretty
sure you could print

00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:17.980
your screen from the website
person of Google Wallet.

00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:19.430
So we have a place where
you can see all the

00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:21.040
offers that you have.

00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:24.290
And in addition, the offers also
support show-and-scan.

00:28:24.290 --> 00:28:27.000
So if the merchant didn't
have NFC, which some

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:28.090
don't, that's OK.

00:28:28.090 --> 00:28:29.930
You just turn the phone around
and show the coupon.

00:28:29.930 --> 00:28:32.120
And maybe it has to offer code
and stuff like that.

00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:34.280
And they can just type it
in and read it our.

00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:37.050
So yeah, we support that.

00:28:37.050 --> 00:28:37.620
Hi.

00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:41.360
AUDIENCE: Can you speak for a
second about the transaction

00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:45.950
information that you guys might
have access to after

00:28:45.950 --> 00:28:48.200
someone processes this?

00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:51.605
If this is integrated, a
retailer decides to integrate

00:28:51.605 --> 00:28:54.870
it online, can you speak to sort
of the data visibility

00:28:54.870 --> 00:28:56.480
you have into the actual
transaction?

00:28:56.480 --> 00:29:00.880
Items purchased, or offers
redeemed, that kind of stuff?

00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:05.070
PETER HAZLEHURST: So I think
if you're asking is, Are we

00:29:05.070 --> 00:29:07.390
looking at the data and
understanding it and using it

00:29:07.390 --> 00:29:09.750
for ads and other
sorts of things?

00:29:09.750 --> 00:29:13.640
And the way things work with
Google Wallet is there's a

00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:15.950
general transaction store, which
is really focused on

00:29:15.950 --> 00:29:17.650
what the consumer can see.

00:29:17.650 --> 00:29:20.180
And then there's information
that we will give back to the

00:29:20.180 --> 00:29:22.660
retailer, if they're the
creator, if the transaction

00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:24.280
occurs in their context.

00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:27.980
And pretty much that's the sort
of continuum of who gets

00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:29.410
to see the information.

00:29:29.410 --> 00:29:32.490
We're very much focused on
letting the user feel

00:29:32.490 --> 00:29:35.170
confident that the information
we store is just for them and

00:29:35.170 --> 00:29:37.190
for their use.

00:29:37.190 --> 00:29:38.326
OK?

00:29:38.326 --> 00:29:38.680
Yes.

00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:40.700
AUDIENCE: Just a follow-up
question on the last one.

00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:45.010
So is Google taking
responsibility in terms of

00:29:45.010 --> 00:29:48.930
fraudulent use, or whatever
happens to those details, or

00:29:48.930 --> 00:29:51.970
like wrong transactions, or
all those kind of things?

00:29:51.970 --> 00:29:54.320
Or how's it going to work out?

00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:57.040
PETER HAZLEHURST: So sitting
behind Google Wallet is all

00:29:57.040 --> 00:30:00.590
the classic security and fraud
monitoring capabilities that

00:30:00.590 --> 00:30:02.420
we've had for very long time.

00:30:02.420 --> 00:30:05.110
And we look and make sure that
transactions seem good to us.

00:30:05.110 --> 00:30:07.280
And if they seem like they're
going to be bad, we'll cancel

00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:10.790
them before they go through to
the merchant, if need be.

00:30:10.790 --> 00:30:12.800
If the consumer has a problem,
their recourse is

00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:13.610
they can call us.

00:30:13.610 --> 00:30:15.840
And we will see if
we can help them.

00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:18.840
But ultimately, they can also
call to a merchant and see if

00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:21.100
they need to solve
issue there.

00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:24.980
So we're making it easy for
the consumer to see, with

00:30:24.980 --> 00:30:26.650
transparency, who's
participating in the

00:30:26.650 --> 00:30:27.690
transaction.

00:30:27.690 --> 00:30:30.170
And giving them the access to
the information they need to

00:30:30.170 --> 00:30:32.520
resolve the concern.

00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:33.380
Yes, sir.

00:30:33.380 --> 00:30:36.310
AUDIENCE: I just got a quick
question of clarification for

00:30:36.310 --> 00:30:38.240
the coupons.

00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:42.290
So you can offer it on your
website, but the actual

00:30:42.290 --> 00:30:47.140
redemption only happens
offline?

00:30:47.140 --> 00:30:48.230
PETER HAZLEHURST: So the
question is you can offer it

00:30:48.230 --> 00:30:50.900
on your website and the
redemption happens offline?

00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:52.790
Yes that's what's
happening today.

00:30:52.790 --> 00:30:56.700
So you can imagine using your
Google Wallet phone as a way

00:30:56.700 --> 00:30:58.411
to redeem that coupon.

00:30:58.411 --> 00:31:00.440
AUDIENCE: I had a question about
the point-of-sale or

00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:01.310
merchant side.

00:31:01.310 --> 00:31:04.860
Are there APIs available to
integrate the redemption into

00:31:04.860 --> 00:31:06.260
a point-of-sale system?

00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:06.950
PETER HAZLEHURST: There
is, actually.

00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:10.130
So we have another group in our
team that works with the

00:31:10.130 --> 00:31:12.820
big point-of-sale retail
software companies.

00:31:12.820 --> 00:31:15.200
And we'd be happy to talk
to you about it.

00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:18.420
So we've got a deep integration
already with IBM,

00:31:18.420 --> 00:31:19.510
for example.

00:31:19.510 --> 00:31:22.120
And that allows for complete
understanding, at the

00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:25.030
line-item level, every
transaction, and each

00:31:25.030 --> 00:31:27.220
different SKU, and whether you
get different reward points,

00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:28.373
and so on based on that.

00:31:28.373 --> 00:31:28.816
AUDIENCE: Great.

00:31:28.816 --> 00:31:29.260
Thanks.

00:31:29.260 --> 00:31:30.046
PETER HAZLEHURST: Sure.

00:31:30.046 --> 00:31:30.512
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:31:30.512 --> 00:31:32.790
If we lose the phone,
how do we ask

00:31:32.790 --> 00:31:35.440
Google to wipe the data?

00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:38.240
PETER HAZLEHURST: So right now,
you just call 1-800--

00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:39.780
whatever our number is
for Google Wallet.

00:31:39.780 --> 00:31:42.800
And they will do it
over the phone.

00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:44.350
If you lose your phone,
how would you call?

00:31:44.350 --> 00:31:46.020
Good question.

00:31:46.020 --> 00:31:48.170
Probably use another
phone to call.

00:31:48.170 --> 00:31:50.840
Assuming you can actually call
Google, then we can delete the

00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:51.920
data for you.

00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:54.330
And we're looking at new
solutions in the future to

00:31:54.330 --> 00:31:56.858
make it easy for you as an end
user to do it yourself.

00:31:56.858 --> 00:31:57.834
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:31:57.834 --> 00:31:58.322
PETER HAZLEHURST:
You're welcome.

00:31:58.322 --> 00:31:59.300
Hi.

00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:02.590
AUDIENCE: I was wondering if
there are any more active ways

00:32:02.590 --> 00:32:04.400
with interacting with
the customer?

00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:09.130
Because the situation you
described in the presentation

00:32:09.130 --> 00:32:11.300
was more like a passive one.

00:32:11.300 --> 00:32:13.480
The customer has to
find this coupon

00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:15.090
on a web page somewhere.

00:32:15.090 --> 00:32:18.630
And if he saves this coupon
to the Wallet, then

00:32:18.630 --> 00:32:19.800
he you can use it.

00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:25.530
But are there any ways for the
retailer to shoot coupons to

00:32:25.530 --> 00:32:27.130
the customers who have
checked into the

00:32:27.130 --> 00:32:29.770
location, or who are nearby?

00:32:29.770 --> 00:32:30.030
PETER HAZLEHURST: Yeah.

00:32:30.030 --> 00:32:32.880
So it's actually, so I'm just
demonstrating the sort of the

00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:34.490
normal, Hey, I was searching
for goods and

00:32:34.490 --> 00:32:35.960
services through the web.

00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:38.690
But the APIs aren't limited
to that use case.

00:32:38.690 --> 00:32:41.160
You could totally apply it to if
you see a check-in in your

00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:43.090
store, you could push a coupon
into their Wallet.

00:32:43.090 --> 00:32:44.210
You could do that today.

00:32:44.210 --> 00:32:46.840
I think if you go to our booth
downstairs, you'll see an

00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:49.250
example of tapping
an NFC poster.

00:32:49.250 --> 00:32:52.100
And that pushes the coupon
into your Wallet.

00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:54.640
The API itself is very
broad and generic.

00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:56.990
We're making it very easy
to integrate in multiple

00:32:56.990 --> 00:32:58.240
different use cases.

00:33:00.810 --> 00:33:04.750
AUDIENCE: Curious about the
emphasis on the OAuth APIs to

00:33:04.750 --> 00:33:06.710
add your credit cards.

00:33:06.710 --> 00:33:09.440
Do you find users are
not inclined to

00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:10.540
enter the data manually?

00:33:10.540 --> 00:33:13.840
Or take a photo of
their cards?

00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:15.340
You know, OCR it?

00:33:15.340 --> 00:33:18.200
Is that something users
don't want to do?

00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:19.760
PETER HAZLEHURST: We find
a couple of issues.

00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:22.500
One is it's just a pain.

00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:24.780
So it's an effort to do it.

00:33:24.780 --> 00:33:27.880
And discovering Google Wallet
as an endpoint to do that,

00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:30.980
rather than being able to be in
online banking and getting

00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:33.220
a notification that you can
now push your cards into

00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:36.020
Google Wallet, actually creates
another channel for

00:33:36.020 --> 00:33:39.240
people to be aware that Google
Wallet even exists.

00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:40.650
And we focused in
on simplicity.

00:33:40.650 --> 00:33:41.890
Making it really, really easy.

00:33:41.890 --> 00:33:45.250
All you have to do is trust your
bank, which you generally

00:33:45.250 --> 00:33:47.330
do, to Google.

00:33:47.330 --> 00:33:49.770
And then you're going to be
able to push information.

00:33:49.770 --> 00:33:51.300
And the upshot of that
is that the banks

00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:52.510
could also push changes.

00:33:52.510 --> 00:33:56.120
So if, for example, your card
expires, or it runs out, or

00:33:56.120 --> 00:33:58.680
you get a new card issued they
can push the changes, as well,

00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:00.540
without you having to
be involved anymore.

00:34:00.540 --> 00:34:02.080
And that's a huge advantage
to consumers.

00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:05.120
Because we see a lot of people
with cards in their Wallet

00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:06.720
that expire over time.

00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:08.670
And then when they're about to
make a payment, they're like,

00:34:08.670 --> 00:34:11.020
Ugh, OK I have to go and update
it and make a change

00:34:11.020 --> 00:34:12.060
and things like that.

00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:14.860
And this keeps the issuer
in with a channel

00:34:14.860 --> 00:34:17.514
to communicate back.

00:34:17.514 --> 00:34:18.900
Cool.

00:34:18.900 --> 00:34:23.940
AUDIENCE: Like somebody asked,
the coupons are only for

00:34:23.940 --> 00:34:24.440
offline use.

00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:27.650
Are there any plans to make them
available for online use,

00:34:27.650 --> 00:34:30.320
like you get a coupon on a
website and use it on another

00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:32.190
website, for instance.

00:34:32.190 --> 00:34:32.560
PETER HAZLEHURST: Yeah.

00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:34.949
So we haven't announced anything
in the area around

00:34:34.949 --> 00:34:36.520
what we're doing on the
online side of things.

00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:39.699
But it's a key area of focus for
us, to make sure that the

00:34:39.699 --> 00:34:42.260
coupons and the offers that you
save are available for use

00:34:42.260 --> 00:34:42.960
everywhere.

00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:43.310
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:34:43.310 --> 00:34:46.070
Thanks.

00:34:46.070 --> 00:34:48.580
AUDIENCE: You mentioned and
demonstrated the creation of a

00:34:48.580 --> 00:34:50.600
coupon on the web page.

00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:53.900
Would you mind going into more
detail about how the

00:34:53.900 --> 00:34:54.610
redemption works?

00:34:54.610 --> 00:34:55.929
The recognition of coupons?

00:34:55.929 --> 00:34:57.880
So, say I'm a retailer,
I have a coupon.

00:34:57.880 --> 00:35:01.150
How do I know that that user has
my coupon in their Wallet?

00:35:01.150 --> 00:35:03.800
Can I look for other coupons
from competitors in their

00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:05.930
Wallet when they scan
their phone?

00:35:05.930 --> 00:35:07.480
How does that work?

00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:08.970
PETER HAZLEHURST: So it's
actually pretty simple in

00:35:08.970 --> 00:35:10.120
terms of the redemption path.

00:35:10.120 --> 00:35:14.880
So either because of tapping,
we're going to push the coupon

00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:18.700
information through Mifare
into the NFC terminal.

00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:21.690
Or if it's a show-and-scan
type of thing, then the

00:35:21.690 --> 00:35:24.500
cashier is going to physically
take an image of a bar code or

00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:25.630
type in the card number.

00:35:25.630 --> 00:35:28.325
So at that point, you as the
retailer know this transaction

00:35:28.325 --> 00:35:29.410
has come through.

00:35:29.410 --> 00:35:31.850
Right now, we haven't made it
possible for a retailer to

00:35:31.850 --> 00:35:33.460
look at what else is stored
in the Wallet.

00:35:33.460 --> 00:35:36.530
AUDIENCE: So but when I tap that
NFC, do I have the coupon

00:35:36.530 --> 00:35:37.540
open on my phone already?

00:35:37.540 --> 00:35:39.610
Or does it just look at my
coupons and go, Oh, that's

00:35:39.610 --> 00:35:43.060
valid, I'll redeem
that for you.

00:35:43.060 --> 00:35:44.520
PETER HAZLEHURST: So let me make
sure-- can you ask the

00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:44.985
question again?

00:35:44.985 --> 00:35:45.130
Sorry.

00:35:45.130 --> 00:35:47.390
AUDIENCE: So I show up at
a store with my phone.

00:35:47.390 --> 00:35:48.990
And I want to redeem a coupon.

00:35:48.990 --> 00:35:51.780
So when I get to the check-out
I'll just tap in on the NFC.

00:35:51.780 --> 00:35:54.010
Do I have to select the coupon
I want to use first?

00:35:54.010 --> 00:35:57.780
Or does it figure out, based
on what's in my wallet, Oh,

00:35:57.780 --> 00:35:58.770
you're at Walgreen's, here.

00:35:58.770 --> 00:36:01.350
Here's this Walgreen's coupon
that you saved previously,

00:36:01.350 --> 00:36:02.650
I'll use that.

00:36:02.650 --> 00:36:03.500
PETER HAZLEHURST: So basically,
what you're going

00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:06.090
to want to do is choose the one
that you want to be active

00:36:06.090 --> 00:36:06.930
at that point in time.

00:36:06.930 --> 00:36:08.475
And then it's going
to passed through.

00:36:08.475 --> 00:36:08.810
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:36:08.810 --> 00:36:09.280
Cool.

00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:09.610
PETER HAZLEHURST: OK?

00:36:09.610 --> 00:36:12.530
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:36:12.530 --> 00:36:13.250
PETER HAZLEHURST: OK.

00:36:13.250 --> 00:36:16.240
Well it doesn't look like we
have any more questions.

00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:17.800
I really want to thank you
guys for your time this

00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:20.580
morning and encourage you to
come and check out some of the

00:36:20.580 --> 00:36:22.960
new ways to add information
to your Wallet.

00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:24.930
And then we're looking for
feedback on other sorts of

00:36:24.930 --> 00:36:28.110
categories of information you
want to store, as we start to

00:36:28.110 --> 00:36:30.450
broaden this out and make it
available across everywhere

00:36:30.450 --> 00:36:32.500
that Google Wallet's accepted.

00:36:32.500 --> 00:36:33.570
Thank you.

00:36:33.570 --> 00:36:36.628
[APPLAUSE]
