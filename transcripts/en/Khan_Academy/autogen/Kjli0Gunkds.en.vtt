00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.305
 Here we have the g function 

00:00:02.305 --> 00:00:04.789
 and I recommend pausing the video 

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:06.763
 and find out how much g (1), 

00:00:06.763 --> 00:00:13.334
 to find how many g (2), g (3) and g (4) are. 

00:00:13.334 --> 00:00:16.143
 Find each of these four. 

00:00:16.143 --> 00:00:18.303
 Okay, now let's do it together. 

00:00:18.303 --> 00:00:22.134
 g (1), if n = 1, 

00:00:22.134 --> 00:00:23.922
 then we will have this case here, 

00:00:23.922 --> 00:00:27.242
 if n = 1, g is equal to 4. 

00:00:27.242 --> 00:00:29.332
 That was pretty easy. 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.820
 Now find g (2) if n = 2. 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.900
 2 is greater than 1 and is a natural number, 

00:00:36.902 --> 00:00:38.828
 so we will use this case. 

00:00:38.828 --> 00:00:39.688
 This is interesting, 

00:00:39.688 --> 00:00:41.847
 because it is determined with respect to the function, 

00:00:41.847 --> 00:00:43.728
 but is not defined with respect to g (n), 

00:00:43.728 --> 00:00:45.864
 but in relation to g (n - 1). 

00:00:45.864 --> 00:00:48.859
 So if n is 2, because here we calculate g (2), 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.040
 we will have g (2 - 1) 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.320
 or g (1) plus 3.2. 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.800
 Okay, how much will it be? 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.695
 We know that g (1) equals 4. 

00:01:02.695 --> 00:01:04.298
 We just found it. 

00:01:04.298 --> 00:01:08.969
 So we have plus 3.2, that's 7.2. 

00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:10.690
 Okay, let's go on. 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:13.472
 g (3), we fall again in this case, 

00:01:13.472 --> 00:01:16.266
 because 3 is greater than 1 and is a natural number. 

00:01:16.266 --> 00:01:20.005
 So this will be g (3 - 1) 

00:01:20.005 --> 00:01:24.100
 or g (2) plus 3.2. 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.794
 Ok, we know how much g (2) is. It's 7.2. 

00:01:27.794 --> 00:01:30.964
 We just found it. It's 7.2. 

00:01:30.964 --> 00:01:37.183
 7.2 plus 3.2 will be equal to 10.4. 

00:01:37.183 --> 00:01:40.321
 And then g (4) - again we come here. 

00:01:40.321 --> 00:01:45.020
 This is g (3) plus 3.2. 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.500
 How equal is this? 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.700
 We have just found that g (3) is 10.4. 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.880
 10.4 plus 3.2 is 13.6. 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.456
 What we have here, 

00:01:58.456 --> 00:01:59.942
 is actually quite interesting. 

00:01:59.942 --> 00:02:03.449
 We can look at this function g 

00:02:03.449 --> 00:02:06.955
 and we see that it is defined for all positive integers. 

00:02:06.955 --> 00:02:08.766
 Because it is defined for the positive integers, 

00:02:08.766 --> 00:02:11.041
 we can consider it as a numerical sequence, 

00:02:11.041 --> 00:02:12.598
 seeing what is the order here. 

00:02:12.598 --> 00:02:16.335
 The first article is 4, 

00:02:16.335 --> 00:02:19.625
 the second member is 7.2, 

00:02:19.625 --> 00:02:23.035
 the next article is 10.4, 

00:02:23.035 --> 00:02:25.965
 the next article is 13.6. 

00:02:25.965 --> 00:02:27.968
 It could continue more and more. 

00:02:27.968 --> 00:02:30.986
 What is happening? What's happening in this line? 

00:02:30.986 --> 00:02:33.400
 We start with 4. 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.620
 And in this case, the function gives us that, 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:38.436
 if n = 1. 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.900
 If n = 1, the function will be 4. 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.520
 Then for each next member 

00:02:44.524 --> 00:02:47.425
 take the previous one and add 3.2. 

00:02:47.425 --> 00:02:51.419
 So, add 3.2 for the second member, add 3.2 again, 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.820
 and just keep adding, 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:01.020
 not 32, and 3.2 - to get to the next member. 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.676
 We can define the function as follows: 

00:03:04.676 --> 00:03:06.546
 "We have a row where the first member is 4, 

00:03:06.546 --> 00:03:10.120
 and then add 3.2 to get each successive member. " 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.781
 But this is another interesting way to define it. 

00:03:12.781 --> 00:03:14.243
 This way of defining the sequence, 

00:03:14.243 --> 00:03:16.589
 in which we assign it as an algebraic function, 

00:03:16.589 --> 00:03:19.793
 which is defined for all positive integers, 

00:03:19.793 --> 00:03:21.302
 where we have a base case. 

00:03:21.302 --> 00:03:23.480
 The basic case gives us the first article 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.876
 and then we have this second case, 

00:03:25.876 --> 00:03:28.082
 which is defined with respect to the function. 

00:03:28.082 --> 00:03:30.079
 Then we have to go back, 

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:32.099
 so we can eventually get the base case. 

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:34.816
 This is called a recursive assignment of a function. 

00:03:34.816 --> 00:03:38.786
 Recurrent feature. 

00:03:38.786 --> 00:03:40.366
 With this example we see 

00:03:40.366 --> 00:03:42.827
 how a recursively assigned function can be used, 

00:03:42.827 --> 00:03:45.636
 to define a number row. 

00:03:45.636 --> 00:03:47.656
 As we stood here, 

00:03:47.656 --> 00:03:48.910
 but we could go the other way. 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:52.499
 And if we look for g (6)? 

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:55.945
 Then you fall into this case and you will say, 

00:03:55.945 --> 00:04:00.008
 "This is g (5) plus 3.2." 

00:04:00.008 --> 00:04:03.398
 We will have the previous article plus 3.2 

00:04:03.398 --> 00:04:05.650
 if we look at it as a line. 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:06.533
 Okay, then we'll have to find 

00:04:06.533 --> 00:04:07.438
 how old is the previous member. 

00:04:07.438 --> 00:04:11.138
 g (5) is g (4) plus 3.2. And after this 

00:04:14.278 --> 00:04:16.262
 continue to go back and back and back. 

00:04:16.262 --> 00:04:18.119
 But we have already found how much g (4) is. 

00:04:18.119 --> 00:04:21.487
 It is 13.6. 

00:04:21.487 --> 00:04:25.357
 So that's 16.8. 

00:04:25.357 --> 00:04:29.496
 And then to g (5), which is 16.8 

00:04:29.496 --> 00:04:33.095
 add 3.2 and get 20. 

00:04:33.095 --> 00:04:34.980
 So you can start with g (6) and continue, going back, 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:36.350
 until you reach g (1) 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:37.719
 and then find out how that is. 

00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:40.274
 You are going back to the base case 

00:04:40.274 --> 00:04:43.292
 and then you can fill in all the empty spaces. 

00:04:43.292 --> 00:04:45.241
 Let's take a few more examples. 

00:04:46.311 --> 00:04:48.191
 This feature is here. 

00:04:48.191 --> 00:04:50.606
 Let's say she sets a line. 

00:04:50.606 --> 00:04:52.603
 Let's think what the first four members will be 

00:04:52.603 --> 00:04:54.089
 from this line and once more 

00:04:54.089 --> 00:04:57.240
 I recommend that you pause the video and find it on your own. 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.440
 Okay, let's do it together. 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:03.800
 h (1) is ... very clearly told us that it is 14. 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.811
 If n equals 1, h is 14. 

00:05:07.811 --> 00:05:11.172
 How much is h (2)? 

00:05:11.172 --> 00:05:13.242
 Now we fall into this case, 

00:05:13.242 --> 00:05:15.659
 because 2 is greater than 1 and is a natural number, 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:19.760
 we will have 28 on h (1). 

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:22.960
 Well, we know that h (1) is 14, 

00:05:22.973 --> 00:05:26.738
 so we have 28 on 14, which is equal to 2. 

00:05:26.738 --> 00:05:29.572
 Now h (3). 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:33.600
 In h (3) we fall back in this case. 

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:38.080
 This will be 28 divided by h (2). 

00:05:38.083 --> 00:05:39.462
 If we look at this as a line, 

00:05:39.462 --> 00:05:42.388
 divided by the previous member in the row. 

00:05:42.388 --> 00:05:43.980
 So, 28 divided by h (2) ... 

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:47.860
 We know h (2) is equal to 2. 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.040
 We found him a while ago. 

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:52.660
 So we go back to 14, something very interesting. 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.440
 I think you see where that goes. 

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:59.720
 h (4) will be 28 divided by h (3), 

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.380
 but h (3) we just found it. 

00:06:06.386 --> 00:06:09.276
 Or divided by 14, which returns us to 2. 

00:06:09.276 --> 00:06:12.387
 If we look at this as a line, 

00:06:12.387 --> 00:06:16.033
 we will say: "The first member is 14, 

00:06:16.033 --> 00:06:19.245
 then we go to 2, 

00:06:19.245 --> 00:06:21.055
 then we go to 14, 

00:06:21.055 --> 00:06:22.235
 then we go to 2. " 

00:06:22.235 --> 00:06:24.020
 One way to look at this line 

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:27.317
 is like just continuing to alternate 14 and 2. 

00:06:27.317 --> 00:06:31.009
 All odd members of the line are 14, 

00:06:31.009 --> 00:06:32.890
 and all even members of the line are 2. 

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:34.817
 This is one way to look at it. 

00:06:34.817 --> 00:06:36.328
 The other way to look at it is, 

00:06:36.328 --> 00:06:38.346
 that we start with 14 

00:06:38.346 --> 00:06:42.015
 and each successive member is the previous member, divided into, 

00:06:42.015 --> 00:06:45.126
 i. 28, divided by the previous article. 

00:06:45.126 --> 00:06:48.284
 So here 28/14 = 2. 

00:06:48.284 --> 00:06:49.460
 28/2 = 14 

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:51.813
 28/14 = 2. 

00:06:51.813 --> 00:06:53.206
 And we go on and on, and on, 

00:06:53.206 --> 00:06:57.223
 and that's exactly what's going on there. 

00:06:57.223 --> 00:06:59.440
 Let's solve one more of these tasks. 

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:01.840
 As this is interesting, 

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:06.636
 because we now have two underlying cases. 

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:10.480
 Let's think about it. 

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:17.040
 We are looking for how much f (4) 

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:20.436
 and we fall into this case. 

00:07:20.436 --> 00:07:22.410
 4 is greater than 2 and is a natural number. 

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:24.732
 We will have f (4) minus 2, 

00:07:24.732 --> 00:07:29.440
 so we will have f (2) + f (4 -1), 

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:31.460
 i. plus f (3). 

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:32.830
 So f (4) is the sum 

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:35.338
 of the previous 2 numbers. 

00:07:35.338 --> 00:07:38.728
 Ok, let's find f (3). 

00:07:38.728 --> 00:07:40.740
 f (3) falls again in this case, 

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:43.987
 we have f (3 - 2) f (1), 

00:07:44.927 --> 00:07:48.642
 plus f (3 - 1), plus f (2), 

00:07:48.642 --> 00:07:51.243
 i. the sum of the previous two numbers. 

00:07:51.243 --> 00:07:53.727
 Let us find out how much f (2) is. 

00:07:53.727 --> 00:07:56.212
 Now we do not have the sum of the previous two numbers. 

00:07:56.212 --> 00:07:59.277
 We fall into this basic case. Now n equals 2. 

00:07:59.277 --> 00:08:01.274
 It will be equal to minus 4. 

00:08:01.274 --> 00:08:04.408
 And now we will find also how much f (1) is. 

00:08:04.408 --> 00:08:07.891
 We see that when n is equal to 1, f is equal to minus 6. 

00:08:07.891 --> 00:08:10.306
 Here are two basics. 

00:08:10.306 --> 00:08:13.928
 Basic cases are those cases that are not defined 

00:08:13.928 --> 00:08:15.344
 in terms of the function itself. 

00:08:15.344 --> 00:08:16.296
 They are needed, 

00:08:16.296 --> 00:08:18.061
 because otherwise you will always go back and forth. 

00:08:18.061 --> 00:08:20.615
 You will never reach real numbers. 

00:08:20.615 --> 00:08:23.502
 But now we can use these to fill in the values ​​here. 

00:08:23.502 --> 00:08:26.954
 The line begins with a minus 6, 

00:08:26.954 --> 00:08:29.833
 then we go to minus 4 as the second member of the row, 

00:08:29.833 --> 00:08:32.016
 and then the third member is the sum of the previous two. 

00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:36.620
 Minus 6 plus minus 4 is minus 10. 

00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:41.740
 And then the fourth member is the sum of the previous two. 

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:43.416
 We see this here. 

00:08:43.416 --> 00:08:45.854
 The second article f (2) plus f (3). 

00:08:45.854 --> 00:08:50.173
 Minus 4 plus minus 10 is minus 14. 

00:08:50.173 --> 00:08:53.122
 As we can continue on the same path. 

00:08:53.122 --> 00:08:55.815
 So this is minus 14 here. 

00:08:55.815 --> 00:08:57.324
 The purpose of this video is 

00:08:57.324 --> 00:08:59.809
 it is better to familiarize yourself with the recurring assignment of functions 

00:08:59.809 --> 00:09:04.638
 and how it can be used to assign numerical rows.
