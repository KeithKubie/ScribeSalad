seriousness that this is what is valued
 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.770
seriousness that this is what is valued
and and that became reflected in our

we've been encouraged to sort of
 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.850
we've been encouraged to sort of
simplify and you know strip back our

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370
get to very simple gray beige interiors
 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.699
get to very simple gray beige interiors
and in a way this has been described as

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709
and in a way this has been described as
 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:59.000
and in a way this has been described as
a sort of reaction to all of the over

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010
a sort of reaction to all of the over
 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.410
a sort of reaction to all of the over

minimalist interiors actually can be
 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.479
minimalist interiors actually can be
very stressful that when you look at our

us and so they set out to create a set

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:04.490
us and so they set out to create a set
 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:06.610

of apartments that they believed would

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:06.620
of apartments that they believed would
 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:09.010

reverse aging and they called this the

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:09.020
reverse aging and they called this the
 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:12.700
reverse aging and they called this the
reversible destiny lofts and the basic

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:12.710
reversible destiny lofts and the basic
 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:15.640
reversible destiny lofts and the basic
