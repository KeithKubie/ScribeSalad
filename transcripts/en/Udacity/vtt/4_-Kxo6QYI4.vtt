00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:04.775
What if I try to code the removeMeanFriends method this way. What's wrong with

00:00:04.775 --> 00:00:07.869
this code? Sometimes it will not remove enough friends, sometimes it will

00:00:07.869 --> 00:00:10.578
remove too many friends, or sometimes an Index Out of Bounds exception will

00:00:10.578 --> 00:00:15.729
occur. As a hint, this condition means, this person is not in person i's

00:00:15.729 --> 00:00:20.185
friends list. This question is diffuclt. You don't have to get it right on the

00:00:20.185 --> 00:00:21.422
first try.
