00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.533
Matt started out with 15 chickens.

00:00:03.533 --> 00:00:08.660
The first thing we should do to solve
this problem is to set up our equation.

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:11.854
So if Matt started with x chickens and

00:00:11.854 --> 00:00:17.014
he divided them into 3 coops,
he got 5 chickens per coop.

00:00:17.014 --> 00:00:20.144
x divided by 3 = 5.

00:00:20.144 --> 00:00:25.800
Now we need to undo this dividing
by 3 to get x on its own.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.847
So the opposite of dividing
is multiplying, so

00:00:28.847 --> 00:00:32.055
let's multiply both sides
of the equation by 3.

00:00:32.055 --> 00:00:37.765
3x over 3 = 5 times 3, which is 15.

00:00:37.765 --> 00:00:43.756
We can cross out these 3s and
we're left with x = 15.
