&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:25.010
&gt;&gt; Carla Davis-Castro: Welcome
to the Library of Congress

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:28.190
and our celebration of Native
American Heritage month.

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:32.120
Our committee is pleased to
have two impactful speakers

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:35.380
with us today, which
we will be filming.

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:36.980
We would like to
thank our sponsor,

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.330
the Office of Equal
Employment Opportunity

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.800
and Diversity Programs,
and our sponsor and host,

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.010
the Law Library of Congress
for supporting this event.

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.320
Please take some time,
if you haven't already,

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.400
to see some of the items
that we have on display.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.360
We have some items from
geography and maps division

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.220
and we also have some
materials from the Law Library

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.390
of Congress relating
to the Seminole Tribe.

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.220
And to get us started, we're
going to watch just a short,

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.170
introductory video
about the work

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.970
of the Indian Law
Resource Center.

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:30.040
[ Music Playing ]

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.200
&gt;&gt; These are the core beliefs of
the Indian Law Resource Center.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.330
For more than 30 years, the
Center has been a global force,

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.700
challenging and building legal
frameworks, to enhance the lives

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.300
of indigenous peoples.

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.690
One of the major causes of
the economic and social ills

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.980
within native communities
is the unfair legal rules

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.030
that apply only to native
peoples in the United States.

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.430
We have taken on cases on
behalf of the Timbisha Shoshone,

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.930
and the Mohawk Nations,
and others with the goal

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.560
of changing some of these laws.

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.840
We also seek to strengthen
sovereignty rights

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.760
so that tribes can better
protect their people.

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.730
This is more critical
now than ever.

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:13.800
&gt;&gt; One in three native women
will be raped in her lifetime

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.790
and three out of five will
be physically assaulted.

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.970
The center's hallmark
work is related

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.420
to the United Nation's
Declaration on the Rights

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.390
of Indigenous Peoples.

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.610
&gt;&gt; Robert T. Coulter: We wanted
to be sure, and we wanted

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.600
to establish legal rules
that would make it clear

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.220
that indigenous peoples
really do own their land.

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.460
They really do have full

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:40.920
and complete legal
rights to those lands.

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.730
But they have rights that can
be protected in the courts.

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.550
Rights that are protected
by definite rules of law

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:53.600
that can't just be thrown out or
ignored by courts or countries

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:54.900
and their governments.

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.250
&gt;&gt; The declaration was adopted

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.290
by the UN General
Assembly in 2007.

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:00.620
&gt;&gt; President Barack Obama:
And as you know, in April,

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.830
we announced that we were
reviewing our position

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:06.260
on the UN Declaration on the
Rights of Indigenous Peoples.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:07.560
And today, I can announce

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.310
that the United States
is lending its support

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.320
to this declaration.

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.700
&gt;&gt; This is just a
snapshot of the work coming

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.070
out of both the Helena, Montana
and Washington DC offices.

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:21.640
We at the Indian Law
Resource Center are experts

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.010
in Indian law, working
to protect

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.970
and preserve indigenous
peoples and their communities.

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.000
Our ultimate goal is to
make positive contributions

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.910
that will have lasting effects.

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.310
&gt;&gt; Carla Davis-Castro:

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.630
Our speakers today are Armstrong
A. Wiggins, the director

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.900
of the Indian Law Resource
Center, Washington DC office.

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.920
Born in Nicaragua, Mr.
Wiggins is a Moskito Indian

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.280
from the village of
Karata in Nicaragua.

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.130
He was the founder of the Indian
organization called [foreign

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:01.370
language], and was the
coordinator of municipal affairs

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.310
of the east coast for the
government of Nicaragua.

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.230
He was also the national
representative

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.880
of the regional Indian
organization [foreign language].

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:14.130
Mr. Wiggins was arrested
twice during both the Somoza

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:17.190
and the Sandinista regimes and
became a political prisoner

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.740
because of his work to
promote human rights

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:21.160
for his people in Nicaragua.

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:25.870
In 1981, Mr. Wiggins
was forced into exile.

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.920
It was at this time that he
began working for the Center

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.810
as the director of its Central
and South America program.

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:33.940
For the past 20 years,
he has worked

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.400
on numerous human rights cases
involving indigenous peoples,

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.960
including the Yano
Nami in Brazil,

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.890
the case against Nicaragua in
the inter-American commission

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:46.300
on human rights in 1984,
which led to changes

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.230
in the constitution of
Nicaragua for the recognition

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:51.150
of indigenous rights
and the creation

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:55.120
of autonomous indigenous
regions in Nicaragua.

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.480
He worked on the case
for the Maya in Belize.

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.070
Mr. Wiggins played
a leading role

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:01.590
in the precedent setting
[foreign language]

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:04.040
in the Inter-American System.

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.230
And he has also played
a critical role

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:09.820

particularly regarding the
Declarations on the Rights

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:17.190
of Indigenous Peoples.

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:19.820
He currently supervises the
works of the Center dealing

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:22.330
with human rights,
standards setting,

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:24.930
and multi-lateral
development banks.

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:28.930
Leonardo Crippa is an
international law scholar

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:30.230
and practitioner.

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:35.150
He holds a JD from the
National University of Tucuman

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:51.810
In his current work
as the senior attorney

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:53.760

in the Congressional Research
Service here at the library.

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:26.800
She is an enrolled member
of the Cherokee Nation.

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.100
Carrie, take it away.

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:29.400
&gt;&gt; Carrie N. Lyons: Thank you.

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:30.720
I'd like to first thank
everybody for coming out today

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:32.970
and supporting us for Native
American Heritage Month.

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:37.500
We really appreciate your taking
time today to come and join us.

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:40.270
And we have two fabulous
guests with us.

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:41.970
And thank you both
for coming out.

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:44.060
We are very honored
to have you today.

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:46.800
And I'm just going to jump right
in with the questions right now.

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.850
So first-- I also have
to do a disclaimer though

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:53.120
that any views expressed
by me are my own

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:55.940
and are not official
representative

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:57.260
of Congressional
Research Service.

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.230
So let me get to the question.

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:01.950
So can you tell us, generally,
about the work that you do

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:05.520
at the Indian Law Resource
Center, and a little bit more

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:08.950
about the structure and how
the organization came to be?

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:13.000
&gt;&gt; Armstrong Wiggins: The Indian
Resource Center is founded

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.400
by Robert T. Coulter.

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:20.290
He's a Potowatomi person.

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:24.210
He's also a judge
in this community.

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:29.670
He represents his nation to the
organization of American States

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:31.360
and the United Nations.

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:37.470
Tim went to Columbia Law
School and, from law school,

00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:41.010
he realized that one of
the biggest challenges

00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:46.750
that indigenous peoples faced
was the very lack of law

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:50.100
that indigenous people
understand.

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:52.010
And the law was very
discriminatory

00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:54.210
against indigenous people.

00:07:54.210 --> 00:08:00.170
We're talking about the
European legal system that came

00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:03.150
to the Americas that
indigenous people had a hard

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:04.450
time understanding.

00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:09.730
&gt;&gt; Could you speak up?

00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:11.130
&gt;&gt; Armstrong Wiggins: We're
talking about the laws

00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:13.060
that came from Europe.

00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:16.940
Indigenous peoples had
a hard time fighting

00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:19.050
against that system.

00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:23.790
In the past, they can
understand their struggle

00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:25.480
between the cowboys and Indians.

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:27.970
And you know that
most of the time

00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:31.650
that cowboys were the good
guys, Indians was the bad guys.

00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:35.770
And so that was a
very heavy challenge.

00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:39.630
And when the legal
system come, and very,

00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:44.100
very racist legal system
against the Indian government

00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:48.120
that existed in this
continent, it was very hard.

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:50.560
First, because they don't
understand the language,

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:52.180
they don't speak English.

00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:55.560
And so it was very
discriminatory.

00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:59.110
So after Tim went to
law school and came out,

00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:03.400
he decided that he needs to form
the Indian Law Resource Center

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:07.640
to represent traditional
Indian governments

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:14.610
against the Washington influence
of how to destroy Indian way

00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:19.030
of thinking, Indian philosophy,
Indian way of looking issues.

00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:22.430
And so they gave lots of money
to Bureau of Indian Affairs

00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:25.800
to destroy traditional
Indian governments.

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:27.130
And you know what happened.

00:09:27.130 --> 00:09:30.750
History will tell you what
happened to indigenous people

00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:33.730
from this terrible
legal thinking.

00:09:33.730 --> 00:09:38.490
And so Tim wanted to create
Indian Law Resource Center

00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:41.140
so that we can represent
them for free.

00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:44.820
Because lawyers were one
of our Indian worst enemy.

00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:47.540
Because they were
represent them, and then,

00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:51.530
if they do win a case,
they owe the lawyer more

00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:53.860
than what they were
supposed to pay.

00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:55.990
And so they didn't get
any benefit from it.

00:09:55.990 --> 00:10:00.710
So the Indian Law Resource
Center is a non-profit office

00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:04.130
that we don't charge
our clients.

00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:10.820
We find our own money to
represent native people.

00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:12.120
The other interesting thing is

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:17.190
that we do not accept
government money.

00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:21.090
We raise our private
money from foundations,

00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:25.860
individuals to represent
Indian governments.

00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:27.860
We do not individual,

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:31.190
we represent collective
governments.

00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:34.760
So that's how Indian Law
Resource Center was created

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:37.690
and founded in 1978.

00:10:37.690 --> 00:10:41.120
Since then, we've been there.

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:45.770
We settle in Washington DC
at the Eastern Market area,

00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:48.220
because we're close to
the Library of Congress.

00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:50.590
In the old days, we
used to come here a lot.

00:10:50.590 --> 00:10:54.250
We used to get to know
everybody at the legal stop.

00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:57.510
Now, don't you don't see me
anymore because of internet.

00:10:57.510 --> 00:11:02.500
[ Laughing ]

00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:04.270
But now we don't come.

00:11:04.270 --> 00:11:05.570
&gt;&gt; Carrie N. Lyons: Right.

00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:07.630
&gt;&gt; Armstrong Wiggins: So that's
the Indian Law Resource Center.

00:11:07.630 --> 00:11:10.280
So then Tim decided
to move to Helena,

00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:12.990
Montana because there are
more indigenous peoples there

00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:14.790
so then work with them closer.

00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:16.090
&gt;&gt; Carrie N. Lyons: Right.

00:11:16.090 --> 00:11:17.390
&gt;&gt; Armstrong Wiggins:
And so the office is--

00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:22.110
the Washington DC office
deals with the Hill here,

00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:26.180
the Congress, the White House,
the OAS, the Organization

00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:28.740
of American States because
you have the Inter-American

00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:31.720
Commission on Human Rights,
the Inter-American Court,

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:35.810
and the World Bank, and the
Inter-American Development Bank.

00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:40.010
All this has to with policy
affecting indigenous people.

00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:44.700
Because the bad economic policy
also affect indigenous people,

00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:47.560
to take away their land
and their resources.

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:49.450
And a lot of people
still believe

00:11:49.450 --> 00:11:51.120
that we're against development.

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:53.150
We are not against development.

00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:55.950
We are against the
kind of development

00:11:55.950 --> 00:11:58.570
that the capitalist system bring

00:11:58.570 --> 00:12:00.930
to the inter-indigenous
community

00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:02.370
that take away their land.

00:12:02.370 --> 00:12:06.990
So we believe in sustainable
economic development.

00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:08.540
&gt;&gt; Carrie N. Lyons:
Right, right.

00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:10.160
Leo, do you have
anything to add?

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:11.460
&gt;&gt; Leonardo A. Crippa: Yes.

00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:12.760
I have something to add.

00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:14.140
Despite the fact

00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:19.420
that [inaudible] I found
the Center is unique

00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:23.010
in the way it presents
tribes, communities,

00:12:23.010 --> 00:12:27.360
because the way the
Center handles the cases,

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:30.590
it's a very long process,

00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:34.610
through which the Center
attorneys will, basically,

00:12:34.610 --> 00:12:36.850
sit down with the communities

00:12:36.850 --> 00:12:39.370
who they are attempting
to represent.

00:12:39.370 --> 00:12:41.830
They will assess their-- yes.

00:12:41.830 --> 00:12:44.030
The attorneys will
assess their legal means,

00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:47.950
the aspirations of
their communities.

00:12:47.950 --> 00:12:49.250
&gt;&gt; Carrie N. Lyons:
Oh, thank you.

00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:54.290
&gt;&gt; Leonardo A. Crippa: The
legal systems of the country,

00:12:54.290 --> 00:12:57.690
with the local council that
the community will select

00:12:57.690 --> 00:12:59.420
in the country.

00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:01.840
We will build a legal strategy.

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:04.290
And that works.

00:13:04.290 --> 00:13:10.280
We, basically, translate
into political strategy,

00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:13.490
the political aspiration
of the community based

00:13:13.490 --> 00:13:16.930
on international laws,
especially human rights law.

00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:18.230
That's unique.

00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:20.690
I've done that over
here in the Center,

00:13:20.690 --> 00:13:23.530
and I work with [inaudible]
another organization

00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:27.230
that also handles
cases internationally.

00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:32.050
But the Center is unique
in that way of working

00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:35.100
with the communities
from the very beginning

00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:39.020
and building the legal
strategy from the bottom.

00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:40.320
&gt;&gt; Carrie N. Lyons: Well,
this leads-- oh yes.

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:41.620
&gt;&gt; Armstrong Wiggins:
And I want to--

00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:43.480
I want to add to that
because that is very important

00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:49.370
to understand what we do is the
political leader's speeches is

00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:51.680
very important to us.

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:53.990
When you are thinking
about environmental issue,

00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:56.680
when you thinking about land
rights issue, when you thinking

00:13:56.680 --> 00:14:00.390
about how we live collectively

00:14:00.390 --> 00:14:03.830
for generations,
in this continent.

00:14:03.830 --> 00:14:05.770
So we take that.

00:14:05.770 --> 00:14:09.260
We listen to them, and
we turn the project,

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:13.630
their political speeches,
into a legal project

00:14:13.630 --> 00:14:18.190
to educate what collective
rights mean, what land surface

00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:21.830
or surface mean to them,

00:14:21.830 --> 00:14:25.190
as compared to Europeans,
what they mean.

00:14:25.190 --> 00:14:28.470
What individual rights verses
collective rights mean.

00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:32.320
You know that European doesn't
believe in collective rights.

00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:35.480
Everything is individual rights.

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:37.340
We do not really believe that.

00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:41.640
We also believe that their
human rights is collective

00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:43.260
and individual rights.

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:44.560
You live with community.

00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:46.160
You live with your village.

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:48.670
And you protect your
village people,

00:14:48.670 --> 00:14:51.380
not just you, individual.

00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:54.670
And that's where
unfairness come.

00:14:54.670 --> 00:14:57.910
That's where, when
people become rich, rich,

00:14:57.910 --> 00:14:59.530
and then you have poor, poor.

00:14:59.530 --> 00:15:05.370
You don't have that collectivity
way of sharing your resources

00:15:05.370 --> 00:15:07.540
that you have, your
land resources,

00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:09.990
whether it's gold, whatever.

00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:13.510
So that is why our way

00:15:13.510 --> 00:15:19.370
of thinking educate the legal
system in the United States.

00:15:19.370 --> 00:15:21.330
And that's what we
call law reform.

00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:23.610
Law reform is very important.

00:15:23.610 --> 00:15:26.330
And that's how Indian Law
Resource Center challenge the

00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:28.370
legal system in the
United States,

00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:30.900
and challenge university
law schools.

00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:35.990
Because we believe lawyers
have very influential position

00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:38.120
in our society in this country.

00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:39.970
Lawyers become president.

00:15:39.970 --> 00:15:42.830
Lawyers become senators,
most of them.

00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:48.250
Lawyers become judges, from
Supreme Court right down.

00:15:48.250 --> 00:15:51.370
And if they don't
understand our way of thinking

00:15:51.370 --> 00:15:56.000
and the legal way of indigenous
people look at their issues,

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.210
their political issues, then,

00:15:58.210 --> 00:16:02.260
that's where discrimination
comes, sometimes by ignorance,

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:04.430
not understanding
the power issue.

00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:06.950
So that's why the legal project.

00:16:06.950 --> 00:16:09.010
And one thing is very important.

00:16:09.010 --> 00:16:12.350
We don't tell our
clients what to do.

00:16:12.350 --> 00:16:15.770
They tell us what to do.

00:16:15.770 --> 00:16:19.550
Because in the past, lawyers
will tell them how they should

00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:21.530
think, how they should
do things.

00:16:21.530 --> 00:16:24.710
We want them to tell us.

00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:26.010
They're our boss.

00:16:26.010 --> 00:16:29.370
So that's how we
create a legal policy

00:16:29.370 --> 00:16:34.580
to help indigenous
people basic human rights.

00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:37.510
&gt;&gt; Carrie N. Lyons: Speaking
of law reform and cases, Leo,

00:16:37.510 --> 00:16:40.090
can you tell us about some
of the most interesting,

00:16:40.090 --> 00:16:43.020
or maybe the most
challenging cases you've had?

00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:44.320
&gt;&gt; Leonardo A. Crippa: Sure.

00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:48.380
I'll tell about the most
challenging one first.

00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:50.250
That was the Rapa Nui Case.

00:16:50.250 --> 00:16:55.780
Rapa Nui's the native of,
basically, Easter Island.

00:16:55.780 --> 00:17:01.930
An island part of the Polynesian
Triangle on the Pacific Ocean.

00:17:01.930 --> 00:17:04.270
&gt;&gt; Could you speak up again?

00:17:04.270 --> 00:17:05.990
I couldn't hear what that was.

00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:07.290
&gt;&gt; Leonardo A. Crippa: Rapa Nui?

00:17:07.290 --> 00:17:09.710
It's an island in
the Pacific Ocean.

00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:12.840
And the native people there
are called Rapa Nui too.

00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:17.120
And so the case-- but we
actually didn't have a case,

00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:21.860
but we got the request from
the Rapa Nui parliament.

00:17:21.860 --> 00:17:26.030
The request, basically, helped
them secure their lands--

00:17:26.030 --> 00:17:28.050
regain control over their lands.

00:17:28.050 --> 00:17:32.210
Because, in the early '90's,
the Chilean government,

00:17:32.210 --> 00:17:35.530
they moved them from
their traditional lands

00:17:35.530 --> 00:17:40.460
to a concentration camp in
the island called Hanga Roa.

00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:44.310
And in 1966, for the very first
time, they were, basically,

00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:48.690
released and were able to
walk free in their own island.

00:17:48.690 --> 00:17:53.140
They became, for the very
first time, citizens of Chile.

00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:59.320
And so it was around 2009,
we received this request.

00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:02.430
We had never heard about them.

00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:06.170
I was on vacation in Argentina
and they decided to put me

00:18:06.170 --> 00:18:09.140
in a plane and send
to me to Chile

00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:11.800
because it was a short flight.

00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:13.460
&gt;&gt; Carrie N. Lyons: So your
vacation was cut short?

00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:14.760
&gt;&gt; Leonardo A. Crippa: Yeah.

00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:16.060
&gt;&gt; Carrie N. Lyons: OK.

00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:17.710
&gt;&gt; Leonardo A. Crippa:
That's why I remember.

00:18:17.710 --> 00:18:22.760
And so, basically, in landed
in this island in the middle

00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:26.290
of the Pacific Ocean, a very
small one, with the population

00:18:26.290 --> 00:18:31.620
of about 5,000 people, around
4,000 were natives, Rapa Nui.

00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:34.440
All of them speak the language.

00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:36.050
They're Polynesian.

00:18:36.050 --> 00:18:37.350
&gt;&gt; Carrie N. Lyons: Leo, can
you speak up a little bit

00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:39.440
for the people in the far back?

00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:42.580
&gt;&gt; Leonardo A. Crippa: And
they decided to go back

00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:44.680
to their official lands.

00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:48.040
In the past there were
18 traditional lands.

00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:51.510
And so they plans to go back.

00:18:51.510 --> 00:18:55.440
What they found, in some
cases, were public offices,

00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:58.050
in other cases, business.

00:18:58.050 --> 00:19:02.590
And their own clan in that
area started to [inaudible].

00:19:02.590 --> 00:19:04.710
And so they were in the middle

00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:07.310
of that action when
I landed there.

00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:11.640
And it was challenging because
I had to assess, as I said,

00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:13.600
what were their legal means?

00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:16.660
How did Indian Law Resource
Center from Washington

00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:20.430
or Helena, Montana
could assist them?

00:19:20.430 --> 00:19:26.850
And I found myself visiting each
of the areas having reoccupied

00:19:26.850 --> 00:19:31.360
by the Rapa Nui families
and clans.

00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:35.050
I knew that Chile was
going to react violently,

00:19:35.050 --> 00:19:38.450
because there's a history
of how Chile, they interacts

00:19:38.450 --> 00:19:43.110
with the Mapuche people
in the south of Chile.

00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:46.500
And so, basically, after
a week of being there,

00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:51.940
I flew back to Washington DC,
reported back to Armstrong

00:19:51.940 --> 00:19:57.910
and Tim what I was
able to learn,

00:19:57.910 --> 00:20:00.480
reported about three
actions that we could take.

00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:02.360
One was immediate.

00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:04.820
We had to secure
the extra measures

00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:07.170
from the Inter-American
Commission on Human Rights here

00:20:07.170 --> 00:20:12.550
in Washington DC so that
preventative actions could be

00:20:12.550 --> 00:20:15.500
ordered to Chile so the
government of Chile would not,

00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:21.240
basically, act violently
against the people of Rapa Nui.

00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:22.540
That was around October.

00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:25.990
The second action
was, basically,

00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:29.460
recover a very important Moai.

00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:33.820
Some of you may know--
have heard about the Moai.

00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:39.880
It plays a very important
role in the Rapa Nui culture,

00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:47.390
in Rapa Nui sense, a traditional
occupation of each of the clans.

00:20:47.390 --> 00:20:51.880
And you will find statues
like this all over the island.

00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:56.730
They are based on a rectangular
base that is called ahu.

00:20:56.730 --> 00:20:59.610
And that's where the
ancestors of each

00:20:59.610 --> 00:21:01.790
of the families are buried.

00:21:01.790 --> 00:21:05.080
I didn't believe that
until they started

00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:07.860
to show me what was below.

00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:15.600
And so the second action
was, basically, try to cover

00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:18.600
from the [inaudible] one
of the most important Moai

00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:22.070
that was removed
from the island.

00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:24.560
It was being shown there.

00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:27.980
And the third one, which
was the most complex one,

00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:33.450
is the determination because
it is an [inaudible] of Chile.

00:21:33.450 --> 00:21:35.850
And so the first
one was challenging.

00:21:35.850 --> 00:21:39.770
I had to represent
about 4,000 people.

00:21:39.770 --> 00:21:43.550
They never took a legal
action against Chile.

00:21:43.550 --> 00:21:48.370
They prepared for the
very first time from us.

00:21:48.370 --> 00:21:51.270
So I started to get
the power of attorneys

00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:53.310
from each of the clans.

00:21:53.310 --> 00:21:58.180
And I ended up filing a request
for precautionary measures

00:21:58.180 --> 00:21:59.480
with the Inter-American
Commission

00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:01.970
for Human Rights here in DC.

00:22:01.970 --> 00:22:06.310
After two months of legal
debates, with regard of Chile,

00:22:06.310 --> 00:22:10.690
the Commission decided to grant
those protective measures.

00:22:10.690 --> 00:22:12.470
By the time it was granted,

00:22:12.470 --> 00:22:15.450
the entire island was
already militarized.

00:22:15.450 --> 00:22:17.120
There were Special Forces.

00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:25.920
And, I'll never forget this,
on December the 3rd of 2009,

00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:30.620
there was a huge operation
against each of the families.

00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:34.040
And most of them were
removed violently.

00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:38.460
And there were shots, people
lost their eyes, and so forth.

00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:41.580
Unfortunately, the
precautionary measures were

00:22:41.580 --> 00:22:43.310
granted afterwards.

00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:45.900
So I wasn't able
to prevent that.

00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:51.610
And it was very violent
situation.

00:22:51.610 --> 00:22:56.050
But in the end, the armed
forces were moved back

00:22:56.050 --> 00:22:57.570
to continental Chile.

00:22:57.570 --> 00:23:00.190
The government was
forced to have a dialogue

00:23:00.190 --> 00:23:04.400
with the traditional Rapa Nui
authorities for the purpose

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:07.480
of discussing the issues
of their main concern.

00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:10.170
That happened for
over four years.

00:23:10.170 --> 00:23:14.440
And so I stopped the violence
in the end, but I wasn't able

00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:18.140
to stop the most bad operation
that happened against them.

00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:20.630
And so that was very
challenging to me.

00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:25.900
The most interesting one
case that I have right now is

00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:28.500
against Guatemala to report
Inter-American Commission

00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:30.160
on Human Rights.

00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:34.670
It is represented a small
Maya Q'eqchi' community

00:23:34.670 --> 00:23:37.990
in the northern part
of [inaudible].

00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:41.950
And it's a case where
this community has been

00:23:41.950 --> 00:23:45.980
under a land-titling program
for more than four years

00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:50.870
without getting the final
title because of irregularities

00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:53.510
in the land surveys
and the land--

00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:54.840
&gt;&gt; Carrie N. Lyons: So they're
supposed to get the land,

00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:56.690
but they haven't
actually gotten it yet.

00:23:56.690 --> 00:23:57.990
OK.

00:23:57.990 --> 00:23:59.850
&gt;&gt; Leonardo A. Crippa: And,
in the meantime, the Ministry

00:23:59.850 --> 00:24:07.140
of Mining has issued permits
to a private mining company

00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:10.910
to explore and exploit
legal on the land belonging

00:24:10.910 --> 00:24:13.120
to this one community.

00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:18.180
And so our lawsuit against
the land titling agency.

00:24:18.180 --> 00:24:20.690
We never thought we were going
to win, but we won that case.

00:24:20.690 --> 00:24:21.990
&gt;&gt; Carrie N. Lyons: Oh, good.

00:24:21.990 --> 00:24:25.680
&gt;&gt; Leonardo A. Crippa: And after
two years with non-process,

00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:28.930
unfortunately, the government
[inaudible] is not enforcing

00:24:28.930 --> 00:24:33.160
this court decision and
so we were, basically,

00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:37.930
we had to sue the government

00:24:37.930 --> 00:24:40.490
for Maya before the
Inter-American Commission.

00:24:40.490 --> 00:24:42.810
And this is now an
international case.

00:24:42.810 --> 00:24:46.600
We are seeking the international
responsibility of Guatemala

00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:50.280
because of the violation
of these community's right

00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:53.760
of property over the
lands that they possess.

00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:56.630
And it is now in the
responsibility stage.

00:24:56.630 --> 00:24:58.340
We won that stage.

00:24:58.340 --> 00:25:02.040
The commission has released the
responsibility report saying

00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:04.920
that we fulfilled all the
requirements set for the

00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:07.120
in American Commission
and Human Rights in May,

00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:10.910
Human Rights Treaty,
ratified by Guatemala.

00:25:10.910 --> 00:25:13.250
And now we are discussing
the merits.

00:25:13.250 --> 00:25:14.590
And it's very interesting

00:25:14.590 --> 00:25:19.870
because it touches
the very structure

00:25:19.870 --> 00:25:26.010
on how lands are taken away
from indigenous communities,

00:25:26.010 --> 00:25:29.520
based on how prevalent
the land survey

00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:32.900
and [inaudible] system
works in Guatemala.

00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:35.190
&gt;&gt; Carrie N. Lyons: Oh, so it
seems like whenever you do take

00:25:35.190 --> 00:25:38.200
up cases, that it's a
long-term commitment.

00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:41.150
And, you know, some of these
cases can take quite a while

00:25:41.150 --> 00:25:44.090
before they are ever resolved.

00:25:44.090 --> 00:25:46.920
&gt;&gt; Armstrong Wiggins: Yeah, I
remember that Leo came in later,

00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:50.360
but Indian Law Resource
Center biggest challenge--

00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:51.930
I mean, first of all,

00:25:51.930 --> 00:25:57.250
I'm a trained electrical
engineer for my first career.

00:25:57.250 --> 00:26:03.040
I never dreamed to be
speaking to you on legal

00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:04.620
and human rights issues.

00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:10.170
Because we used to-- and my
specialty was in antennae.

00:26:10.170 --> 00:26:12.250
I was supposed to be
an astronaut, right?

00:26:12.250 --> 00:26:16.070
That was my interest, you know,
an electrical engineer, pilot,

00:26:16.070 --> 00:26:19.350
go to Cape Kennedy, and go up.

00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:22.310
But my people, the Moskito
people called me back

00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:23.610
to come home.

00:26:23.610 --> 00:26:25.830
And that's how I get
involved in politics

00:26:25.830 --> 00:26:28.490
and end up in jail twice.

00:26:28.490 --> 00:26:31.890
And I think one of the
things that very challenging

00:26:31.890 --> 00:26:35.710
from Indian Law Resource
Center perspective was

00:26:35.710 --> 00:26:38.150
to change things.

00:26:38.150 --> 00:26:42.430
And I guess that's what
happened between us,

00:26:42.430 --> 00:26:44.500
the Indian Law Resource Center.

00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:50.600
I think that one of the thing
that is very important is

00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:54.760
to work so close with
our leaders, our people.

00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:59.750
And work with them and do
the work that we need to do.

00:26:59.750 --> 00:27:05.500
And so our big, big, big first
challenges was in Nicaragua

00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:06.800
because of the cold war.

00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:08.940
And I'm sure all
of you know that.

00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:13.600
That divided us in Nicaragua,
divided Americans here

00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:17.020
because of Reagan administration
verses the Sandinista

00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:20.220
government, the contras, and
the human rights was divided.

00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:23.240
And I was in the
middle of it here,

00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:24.660
because I came out of jail here.

00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:27.780
And I challenged Senator
Kennedy, Senator McCain,

00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:30.760
Senator Dole, everybody
that there was not black

00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:32.640
and white in Central America.

00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:35.470
There was indigenous people
in the middle of that black

00:27:35.470 --> 00:27:38.110
and white, left and right.

00:27:38.110 --> 00:27:41.890
And so a lot of people
didn't take side.

00:27:41.890 --> 00:27:44.390
And I'm sure today,
in Washington,

00:27:44.390 --> 00:27:47.140
you will see what's going on.

00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:50.500
During the 80's, something
was going on like that too.

00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:53.810
They divide the family,
everybody was divided

00:27:53.810 --> 00:27:56.040
because of taking side.

00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:57.570
And Indian Law Resource
Center was

00:27:57.570 --> 00:27:59.620
in the middle of
that challenges.

00:27:59.620 --> 00:28:03.770
And from that challenges,
we have, now, in Nicaragua,

00:28:03.770 --> 00:28:06.410
autonomous government
with indigenous people.

00:28:06.410 --> 00:28:08.980
We have special system
that was set up.

00:28:08.980 --> 00:28:13.070
And our constitution
was improved.

00:28:13.070 --> 00:28:17.110
Because I bring cases
against Sandinista government

00:28:17.110 --> 00:28:20.650
that changed the Nicaraguan
constitution in 1987,

00:28:20.650 --> 00:28:24.100
and more progressive
towards indigenous people.

00:28:24.100 --> 00:28:29.740
We brought a legal case
against Yanomami case in Brazil.

00:28:29.740 --> 00:28:33.480
That now Yanomami have a
Yanomami park in Brazil.

00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:36.790
These were uncontacted
people that we represented.

00:28:36.790 --> 00:28:39.950
I went in there,
in their community.

00:28:39.950 --> 00:28:42.930
That you have to deal with
them to get their land rights.

00:28:42.930 --> 00:28:45.350
Now they have the
Yanomami Park in Brazil,

00:28:45.350 --> 00:28:50.630
one of the biggest land, kind
of, rights issue that happened

00:28:50.630 --> 00:28:54.870
in Brazil after the
Kayopi in Brazil.

00:28:54.870 --> 00:28:58.380
Then we bring the case against
Belize, the Mayan people.

00:28:58.380 --> 00:29:01.350
Now they have their
land rights approved

00:29:01.350 --> 00:29:03.920
by Belize Supreme Court,

00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:07.920
recognized by the regional
court in the Caribbean.

00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:09.220
It leads the Mayan people.

00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:10.970
Now they have their land rights.

00:29:10.970 --> 00:29:16.790
And then we have the biggest
one was Stanley vs. Nicaragua,

00:29:16.790 --> 00:29:22.090
which is now the international
community recognized indigenous

00:29:22.090 --> 00:29:25.850
people land throughout
the Inter-American system.

00:29:25.850 --> 00:29:29.040
And so those are some of the
challenges that we faced.

00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:32.230
And we struggled through that.

00:29:32.230 --> 00:29:37.810
And get support from the
international community.

00:29:37.810 --> 00:29:39.140
And the other challenge was

00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:41.260
to create international
development,

00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:45.620
international standard,
international declaration.

00:29:45.620 --> 00:29:48.350
Which, this is the
United Nation declaration.

00:29:48.350 --> 00:29:50.790
And this is the American
declaration on rights

00:29:50.790 --> 00:29:55.110
of indigenous people that
was just adopted last year,

00:29:55.110 --> 00:29:58.280
in the general assembly
of the [inaudible].

00:29:58.280 --> 00:30:00.800
So all this is here
if you people want

00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:03.070
to read what these declaration.

00:30:03.070 --> 00:30:04.910
&gt;&gt; Carrie N. Lyons: I think
they're out-- outside.

00:30:04.910 --> 00:30:06.210
&gt;&gt; Armstrong Wiggins: Outside.

00:30:06.210 --> 00:30:08.780
And so, this is what
Leo was talking

00:30:08.780 --> 00:30:11.200
about just not too long ago.

00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:15.210
So we face a lot of
challenges ahead of us still.

00:30:15.210 --> 00:30:18.530
And you see from even from
yesterday at the White House,

00:30:18.530 --> 00:30:20.590
we still faces a lot
of discrimination,

00:30:20.590 --> 00:30:23.080
a lot of struggle that we need

00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:26.240
to overcome regarding
our people rights.

00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:27.920
&gt;&gt; Carrie N. Lyons: Can
you tell us about some

00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:30.890
of your experiences working
with tribal governments

00:30:30.890 --> 00:30:32.260
in the United States on VAWA.

00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:35.390
Because that's a bit
of a success story.

00:30:35.390 --> 00:30:36.690
&gt;&gt; Armstrong Wiggins: Yes,

00:30:36.690 --> 00:30:40.370
that's VAWA is a big success
story, but it's ongoing.

00:30:40.370 --> 00:30:41.670
&gt;&gt; Carrie N. Lyons: Yeah.

00:30:41.670 --> 00:30:43.030
&gt;&gt; Armstrong Wiggins: And a
lot of challenges that we face

00:30:43.030 --> 00:30:47.640
in the United States
because, as you know,

00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:53.980
VAWA was first introduced
by Senator Biden in 1994.

00:30:53.980 --> 00:30:55.280
And they went through a lot

00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:58.990
of process till 2013,
VAWA was approved.

00:30:58.990 --> 00:31:00.290
&gt;&gt; Carrie N. Lyons: Right,

00:31:00.290 --> 00:31:01.590
so VAWA is the Violence
Against Women Act.

00:31:01.590 --> 00:31:02.960
&gt;&gt; Armstrong Wiggins: Violence
Against Women Act, yes.

00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:06.930
1994 and 2013.

00:31:06.930 --> 00:31:09.800
&gt;&gt; Carrie N. Lyons: Right,
reauthorization in 2013, yeah.

00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:13.680
&gt;&gt; Armstrong Wiggins:
And so as we speak here

00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:18.770
in Indian Law Resource Center,
my stop is in Alaska meeting

00:31:18.770 --> 00:31:21.780
with Alaska native
women organization

00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:25.580
that federal government just
give them $1 million to work

00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:27.340
on their human rights issues.

00:31:27.340 --> 00:31:30.190
And that we're working
how to implement both.

00:31:30.190 --> 00:31:34.630
So we're having workshop
now as we speak in Alaska,

00:31:34.630 --> 00:31:36.880
talking about how
to implement VAWA.

00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:41.680
Some of the challenges
that we face has to do

00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:44.230
with economic aspect of it.

00:31:44.230 --> 00:31:48.900
For example, because of
the jurisdiction issues

00:31:48.900 --> 00:31:55.220
between the non-Indian legal
system verses the Indian legal

00:31:55.220 --> 00:31:59.410
system and how that can be
worked out and negotiated.

00:31:59.410 --> 00:32:03.360
Who is going to pay
for those expenses?

00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:06.060
And so it's an ongoing thing.

00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:09.520
But one of the thing
that we feel very good is

00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:13.360
that we have a lot
of good women,

00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:17.040
native women, leading
this fight.

00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:20.090
And I can name many of
them, Terry Henry, you know,

00:32:20.090 --> 00:32:24.470
others who are leading
this fight nationally.

00:32:24.470 --> 00:32:29.350
And so we are just supporting
them, and now working with them,

00:32:29.350 --> 00:32:31.190
helping them fundraising.

00:32:31.190 --> 00:32:36.260
A general worker from our
office is the head of one

00:32:36.260 --> 00:32:41.450
of our senior lawyer from Basin,
Montana, she's leading this work

00:32:41.450 --> 00:32:44.100
with Chris Foley
[phonetic spelling].

00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:48.550
And we have Karla General
in our office here in DC.

00:32:48.550 --> 00:32:51.200
She just went back to
work for her government

00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:54.370
in Six Nations Territory.

00:32:54.370 --> 00:32:58.330
But these are wonderful
people fighting

00:32:58.330 --> 00:33:00.410
for this totally implement VAWA.

00:33:00.410 --> 00:33:02.380
&gt;&gt; Carrie N. Lyons:
Right, right, great.

00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:06.350
I know you also did some work
with the Seminoles in Florida

00:33:06.350 --> 00:33:09.390
and gave them the opportunity
to buy back some land.

00:33:09.390 --> 00:33:10.690
Could you tell us about that?

00:33:10.690 --> 00:33:13.070
&gt;&gt; Armstrong Wiggins: Yes,
Seminole, these are, you know,

00:33:13.070 --> 00:33:14.950
there's two group of Seminoles.

00:33:14.950 --> 00:33:18.830
One is the traditional
Seminoles, and the other one

00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:22.550
that is more successful
one, they have casinos.

00:33:22.550 --> 00:33:25.480
They have protect.

00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:27.860
&gt;&gt; Carrie N. Lyons:
Hard rock, right?

00:33:27.860 --> 00:33:31.050
&gt;&gt; Armstrong Wiggins: We have
Seminoles, I think that was one

00:33:31.050 --> 00:33:34.310
of my interesting experience.

00:33:34.310 --> 00:33:38.420
Because they don't
believe in compromising.

00:33:38.420 --> 00:33:41.180
They believe that they
need to be left alone.

00:33:41.180 --> 00:33:44.520
They want to have their
own traditional ceremonies.

00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:49.280
And they lost land and so
they used to borrow land

00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:51.750
from citrus growers in Florida,

00:33:51.750 --> 00:33:55.740
to do their green
dance ceremonies.

00:33:55.740 --> 00:34:01.560
And so they look to us for help,
how to get land that they lost

00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:04.980
to have their traditional
and then their homes,

00:34:04.980 --> 00:34:09.530
to build their homes the way
they want, tipis, basically.

00:34:09.530 --> 00:34:12.320
And so we represented them.

00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:16.170
And I think that was very
difficult from my experience,

00:34:16.170 --> 00:34:17.970
because they won't compromise.

00:34:17.970 --> 00:34:21.720
In other words, it's
hard to negotiate

00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:24.260
between non-Indian verses them.

00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:30.400
But we were lucky to go outside
of Florida to look for help.

00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:33.500
I don't know if you heard
about land foundation?

00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:37.780
It's based in Santa
Fe, New Mexico.

00:34:37.780 --> 00:34:39.800
It's a very rich family.

00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:47.630
Patrick Lannan, one day, knocked
at my door here in DC and said,

00:34:47.630 --> 00:34:51.310
in a blue jean, you know,
dressed like somebody

00:34:51.310 --> 00:34:52.660
that don't have money.

00:34:52.660 --> 00:34:56.720
And he said, I am Patrick Lannan
and I want to talk to you guys

00:34:56.720 --> 00:34:59.070
about how we can help.

00:34:59.070 --> 00:35:00.470
&gt;&gt; Carrie N. Lyons:
Help the Seminoles.

00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:01.770
&gt;&gt; Armstrong Wiggins:
Not only the Seminoles,

00:35:01.770 --> 00:35:03.070
Indian Law Resource Center.

00:35:03.070 --> 00:35:04.370
&gt;&gt; Carrie N. Lyons: Oh.

00:35:04.370 --> 00:35:05.670
&gt;&gt; Armstrong Wiggins: We
are interested in education.

00:35:05.670 --> 00:35:09.350
We want to help tribal
government, technical schools.

00:35:09.350 --> 00:35:11.780
We want to get them money.

00:35:11.780 --> 00:35:13.080
And so I'm here.

00:35:13.080 --> 00:35:16.070
I heard about you guys
and we want to talk.

00:35:16.070 --> 00:35:17.850
And that's how we started.

00:35:17.850 --> 00:35:22.330
And Patrick Lannan paid for
this huge land in Florida

00:35:22.330 --> 00:35:25.360
for the Seminoles, $1.5 million.

00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:26.660
&gt;&gt; Carrie N. Lyons: Wow.

00:35:26.660 --> 00:35:28.330
&gt;&gt; Armstrong Wiggins: From the
citrus growers that they used

00:35:28.330 --> 00:35:30.330
to do their ceremonies.

00:35:30.330 --> 00:35:32.700
And so now they have a land

00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:35.750
that is not only the
Seminole have a land

00:35:35.750 --> 00:35:37.230
to do their traditional work,

00:35:37.230 --> 00:35:40.290
but this land will be
protected environmentally.

00:35:40.290 --> 00:35:45.260
This land, they have bald
eagles, they have alligators,

00:35:45.260 --> 00:35:49.820
and there's not in that
destructive way of development.

00:35:49.820 --> 00:35:52.610
And then the other fight
we had with the state

00:35:52.610 --> 00:35:54.540
of Florida was the Tipis.

00:35:54.540 --> 00:35:56.610
Because they wanted to
build their own homes.

00:35:56.610 --> 00:36:00.480
And because of rules
of building codes,

00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:02.630
the Florida government said, no.

00:36:02.630 --> 00:36:06.940
so we tried to get, you know,
all the newspaper on our side

00:36:06.940 --> 00:36:09.730
to make, you know, kind
of challenge the state.

00:36:09.730 --> 00:36:11.850
And state finally give in

00:36:11.850 --> 00:36:15.240
and let them build
their own typical homes

00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:18.150
to have their own
traditional ceremonies.

00:36:18.150 --> 00:36:19.450
&gt;&gt; Carrie N. Lyons: Wow.

00:36:19.450 --> 00:36:20.750
&gt;&gt; Armstrong Wiggins: And
so that's a great story.

00:36:20.750 --> 00:36:22.800
&gt;&gt; Carrie N. Lyons: Now,
that's a success story, yeah.

00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:24.270
&gt;&gt; Armstrong Wiggins: And the
other day I was riding the--

00:36:24.270 --> 00:36:28.300
I ride the metro from
Washington, from Virginia to DC.

00:36:28.300 --> 00:36:31.320
And there were some native
kids, high school kids.

00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:33.440
And they were laughing
and joking.

00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:37.010
And they come and sit by
me and start talking to me.

00:36:37.010 --> 00:36:38.660
And I said, where you from?

00:36:38.660 --> 00:36:42.200
And he said, I'm a
Seminole from Florida.

00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:43.510
We're visiting Washington.

00:36:43.510 --> 00:36:44.810
&gt;&gt; Carrie N. Lyons: Wow.

00:36:44.810 --> 00:36:46.240
&gt;&gt; Armstrong Wiggins: I said,
do you know Uncle Billy?

00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:51.460
That's my uncle!

00:36:51.460 --> 00:36:52.760
&gt;&gt; Carrie N. Lyons: Wow.

00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:55.510
&gt;&gt; Armstrong Wiggins:
How do you know my uncle?

00:36:55.510 --> 00:36:56.870
Because I work with him.

00:36:56.870 --> 00:36:58.590
&gt;&gt; Carrie N. Lyons: Serendipity.

00:36:58.590 --> 00:37:00.250
&gt;&gt; Armstrong Wiggins:
They were excited.

00:37:00.250 --> 00:37:03.770
A week later the uncle
called me and said--

00:37:03.770 --> 00:37:05.880
&gt;&gt; Carrie N. Lyons:
Nice, very nice.

00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:09.320
Have there been any cases or
issues that you wanted to take

00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:11.930
that you've been unable
to take at the Center.

00:37:11.930 --> 00:37:13.290
&gt;&gt; Armstrong Wiggins:
Oh, there's so many.

00:37:13.290 --> 00:37:19.160
If we have, like some-- if we
get money from the government,

00:37:19.160 --> 00:37:22.390
the European government
offered lots of money,

00:37:22.390 --> 00:37:23.780
but we don't accept it.

00:37:23.780 --> 00:37:27.890
Because sometimes there
are conditions of why.

00:37:27.890 --> 00:37:34.330
There's so many cases, tenure
land title is so important

00:37:34.330 --> 00:37:37.460
to us, legal rights
to their land.

00:37:37.460 --> 00:37:43.140
And if you watch the world
changing toward our issues,

00:37:43.140 --> 00:37:47.350
European begin to support
Indian thinking about how

00:37:47.350 --> 00:37:52.790
to manage land, how to
manage natural resources,

00:37:52.790 --> 00:37:54.750
and climate issues.

00:37:54.750 --> 00:38:00.320
And so land titling
is very important

00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:03.600
so that indigenous people
can manage their land.

00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:05.810
Protected area, how
we protect our way

00:38:05.810 --> 00:38:08.870
from World Wildlife Fund,
Conservation International

00:38:08.870 --> 00:38:14.170
and others, that only follow
the money trail, especially USA.

00:38:14.170 --> 00:38:18.340
But when that money
finished, they move back

00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:21.650
to [inaudible] City, or
they move back to Roselyn,

00:38:21.650 --> 00:38:23.340
because they don't have
money to stay there.

00:38:23.340 --> 00:38:26.550
So then the bad guys move in
and destroy the environment.

00:38:26.550 --> 00:38:29.170
And they don't respect
indigenous people land rights.

00:38:29.170 --> 00:38:31.240
They only work with
the central government.

00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:33.080
And so that's the problem.

00:38:33.080 --> 00:38:35.810
If indigenous people
managed those areas,

00:38:35.810 --> 00:38:38.320
those land like Bosawas
Nicaragua,

00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:41.230
and many other people
in Brazil, you know.

00:38:41.230 --> 00:38:43.470
Only the bone that fell

00:38:43.470 --> 00:38:46.470
from these environmental
organization, they get money

00:38:46.470 --> 00:38:49.960
from USAID goes to
the indigenous people.

00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:52.500
But then when they move
out, indigenous people have

00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:55.050
to face the poacher, the people

00:38:55.050 --> 00:38:58.040
that cut their land
and their territory.

00:38:58.040 --> 00:39:01.180
We would like to work
for them in Brazil.

00:39:01.180 --> 00:39:06.800
We would like to work with
them with the Brazilian banks.

00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:11.940
That is very, very bad against
Indian land rights issues,

00:39:11.940 --> 00:39:14.660
take away Indian lands
by building the highways

00:39:14.660 --> 00:39:18.700
and the dams and
stuff like that.

00:39:18.700 --> 00:39:20.000
Do you know that the
[Foreign Language],

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:23.150
which is the Brazil
bank, has more money

00:39:23.150 --> 00:39:25.350
than World Bank right now?

00:39:25.350 --> 00:39:27.900
And so they give very
destructive development

00:39:27.900 --> 00:39:31.850
that is not good for
indigenous people.

00:39:31.850 --> 00:39:36.000
So we try to work with
educate these banks

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:38.260
and develop legal mechanism

00:39:38.260 --> 00:39:40.640
to restrict indigenous
people land rights.

00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:43.750
But we don't have all
that money to do that.

00:39:43.750 --> 00:39:46.530
European are now beginning
to give some money.

00:39:46.530 --> 00:39:49.200
They just created an
institute in Stockholm

00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:51.880
about Indian land tenure issues.

00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:53.180
&gt;&gt; Carrie N. Lyons: Oh, wow.

00:39:53.180 --> 00:39:54.480
&gt;&gt; Armstrong Wiggins: But
I don't know if it will go

00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:55.780
to the indigenous people.

00:39:55.780 --> 00:39:57.080
And that's the thing.

00:39:57.080 --> 00:39:58.380
There are a lot of
discrimination about money given

00:39:58.380 --> 00:40:00.210
to indigenous people also.

00:40:00.210 --> 00:40:04.980
And because, you
know, intermediaries.

00:40:04.980 --> 00:40:06.280
&gt;&gt; Carrie N. Lyons:
Right, right.

00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:09.540
Leo, is there any case you
wish you could have taken?

00:40:09.540 --> 00:40:10.840
&gt;&gt; Leonardo A. Crippa:
Most of the--

00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:12.570
I mean, reason why
we don't take a lot

00:40:12.570 --> 00:40:15.040
of cases is money, basically.

00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:18.160
We can't represent all the
clients that we would like to.

00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:21.670
So we are very selective
of the cases that we take,

00:40:21.670 --> 00:40:24.510
especially looking
into the issues.

00:40:24.510 --> 00:40:27.430
If we take a case,
we will, basically,

00:40:27.430 --> 00:40:32.240
gain reform in the
politics of that country.

00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:34.310
That's the main reason.

00:40:34.310 --> 00:40:38.380
However, there are situations
where we start looking

00:40:38.380 --> 00:40:41.130
to the case, documenting
the facts,

00:40:41.130 --> 00:40:45.150
starting to interview local
authorities about the issues

00:40:45.150 --> 00:40:48.510
that the indigenous
communities are concerned.

00:40:48.510 --> 00:40:51.620
In the end, when we are about
to take the legal action,

00:40:51.620 --> 00:40:53.090
and we have secured
some resources,

00:40:53.090 --> 00:40:55.140
the issue is resolved.

00:40:55.140 --> 00:40:56.510
So no case, right?

00:40:56.510 --> 00:40:59.190
I can mention a few examples.

00:40:59.190 --> 00:41:01.100
One is the [inaudible]
community.

00:41:01.100 --> 00:41:06.810
It's a [inaudible] community
in the Peruvian Amazon,

00:41:06.810 --> 00:41:10.120
close to the border with Brazil.

00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:16.360
There was an interoceanic
highway was going to be built

00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:20.010
with funds coming from both
the Brazil Development Bank

00:41:20.010 --> 00:41:22.630
and the Inter-American
Development Bank that will,

00:41:22.630 --> 00:41:25.150
basically, connect
Brazil [inaudible]

00:41:25.150 --> 00:41:30.180
on the Brazil side
with Pucullpa Peru.

00:41:30.180 --> 00:41:33.440
And will, basically,
divide up the land

00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:37.800
where this community
was located.

00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:42.730
And so we started to inquire
where the funds were coming,

00:41:42.730 --> 00:41:47.810
the permits that these companies
had to build that road.

00:41:47.810 --> 00:41:50.590
In the middle of that,
the [inaudible] the head

00:41:50.590 --> 00:41:55.120
of this community started
to talk to civil society,

00:41:55.120 --> 00:41:58.570
locally in Pucullpa,
and there nationally

00:41:58.570 --> 00:42:01.420
in Lima, the capital of Peru.

00:42:01.420 --> 00:42:03.870
So we started to make
some noise about it.

00:42:03.870 --> 00:42:06.220
And in the middle of that,

00:42:06.220 --> 00:42:08.000
the transportation
authorities started

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:10.510
to cancel all the permits.

00:42:10.510 --> 00:42:13.090
They basically redesigned
the project, and as a result,

00:42:13.090 --> 00:42:15.110
they weren't going to
divide up that community.

00:42:15.110 --> 00:42:16.410
And so we had no case to take.

00:42:16.410 --> 00:42:17.710
&gt;&gt; Carrie N. Lyons: OK.

00:42:17.710 --> 00:42:19.660
&gt;&gt; Leonardo A. Crippa: And
there were some cases like that.

00:42:19.660 --> 00:42:21.820
But mainly it is a
lack of resources.

00:42:21.820 --> 00:42:27.140
We are very selective about the
cases, because we actually want

00:42:27.140 --> 00:42:29.430
to have a huge impact
on the country.

00:42:29.430 --> 00:42:33.410
And we want one case to
benefit not only our client,

00:42:33.410 --> 00:42:37.010
but also other communities
that are the same legal

00:42:37.010 --> 00:42:38.480
and factual situation.

00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:39.780
&gt;&gt; Carrie N. Lyons: Right.

00:42:39.780 --> 00:42:42.290
&gt;&gt; Armstrong Wiggins: The other
thing that we would like to,

00:42:42.290 --> 00:42:48.500
is the new thinking between
United States all the way to,

00:42:48.500 --> 00:42:50.290
probably, Argentina.

00:42:50.290 --> 00:42:53.580
That most of the coastal
communities are indigenous land

00:42:53.580 --> 00:42:54.880
and resources.

00:42:54.880 --> 00:43:00.530
And now because of wind and new
energy system, they're going

00:43:00.530 --> 00:43:03.600
to affect them in a different
way in indigenous community

00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:06.240
without consulting with them,

00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:08.690
without indigenous
people planning

00:43:08.690 --> 00:43:10.750
to take from these wind.

00:43:10.750 --> 00:43:14.170
They're going to set out
for energy provide use.

00:43:14.170 --> 00:43:17.010
&gt;&gt; Carrie N. Lyons: Oh, like
the wind farms, and-- yeah.

00:43:17.010 --> 00:43:18.310
&gt;&gt; Armstrong Wiggins:

00:43:18.310 --> 00:43:19.610
The benefit doesn't go
to indigenous people.

00:43:19.610 --> 00:43:22.730
It goes to Walmart, it
goes to, like in Mexico,

00:43:22.730 --> 00:43:29.050
it goes to Corona, the factory,
the Corona beer company,

00:43:29.050 --> 00:43:30.860
and other big corporations.

00:43:30.860 --> 00:43:33.860
And so we've been to
us to help in that.

00:43:33.860 --> 00:43:37.210
And Leo can talk about
that too, in Mexico.

00:43:37.210 --> 00:43:38.550
What we just did was one

00:43:38.550 --> 00:43:42.010
of the biggest project
in Latin America.

00:43:42.010 --> 00:43:43.310
But it's going to happen.

00:43:43.310 --> 00:43:46.130
Even in my territory,
in Moskito coast,

00:43:46.130 --> 00:43:49.560
is where all the Atlantic
coast is where the wind is.

00:43:49.560 --> 00:43:51.350
And it's Indian land.

00:43:51.350 --> 00:43:55.740
And so now Indian land has
been challenged by governments.

00:43:55.740 --> 00:43:59.350
One of the good thing is that
Indian Law Resource Center,

00:43:59.350 --> 00:44:02.080
because of the negotiating
with all these states

00:44:02.080 --> 00:44:05.240
for over 30 years in
Geneva, I was the founder

00:44:05.240 --> 00:44:11.020
of the UN declaration,
beginning in 1977.

00:44:11.020 --> 00:44:13.210
Tim and I was there
at the beginning.

00:44:13.210 --> 00:44:16.440
I remember when we woke up
that morning, we couldn't get

00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:19.780
out to go to our meetings
because the school bus came

00:44:19.780 --> 00:44:22.970
from all over Europe
to see Indians, right?

00:44:22.970 --> 00:44:26.050
Because that was the first
time we came to Europe,

00:44:26.050 --> 00:44:29.610
to attend the United
Nation, 1977.

00:44:29.610 --> 00:44:32.380
The working group
started in 1982.

00:44:32.380 --> 00:44:37.370
And the declaration
was adopted in 2007.

00:44:37.370 --> 00:44:39.640
Imagine how long we negotiated.

00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:43.240
Especially with England was
the most difficult thing

00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:44.890
because England didn't believe

00:44:44.890 --> 00:44:47.350
that individual rights
is human rights,

00:44:47.350 --> 00:44:49.180
so they will not support us.

00:44:49.180 --> 00:44:53.490
And so we wanted consensus to be
developed in the United Nation.

00:44:53.490 --> 00:44:57.080
And then the Organization of
American States, renegotiated

00:44:57.080 --> 00:45:01.380
since 1989, to work
on the declaration.

00:45:01.380 --> 00:45:05.830
And that is because Spain
wanted to celebrate 500 years

00:45:05.830 --> 00:45:09.160
of discovery and wanted
to give money to the OAS,

00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:11.580
and so they wanted to
come up with something

00:45:11.580 --> 00:45:13.480
about indigenous people.

00:45:13.480 --> 00:45:16.220
And, you know, OAS was
a good old boys place.

00:45:16.220 --> 00:45:18.910
No NGOs would participate.

00:45:18.910 --> 00:45:21.330
No Indians come there.

00:45:21.330 --> 00:45:23.870
Only them elected people.

00:45:23.870 --> 00:45:28.080
We said, no, we want to be
part of that negotiation.

00:45:28.080 --> 00:45:31.420
And, as Canadian
ambassador said it,

00:45:31.420 --> 00:45:34.330
that Indian people
kicked the OAS door open,

00:45:34.330 --> 00:45:38.470
not only for indigenous
people, but for civil society,

00:45:38.470 --> 00:45:42.030
and for NGOs, Non-Governmental
Organization.

00:45:42.030 --> 00:45:47.960
And so, really, Indian Law
Resource Center was advising

00:45:47.960 --> 00:45:51.180
their leaders, coming that
and giving legal advice.

00:45:51.180 --> 00:45:55.730
And because of that, all member
states, whether OAS or the UN,

00:45:55.730 --> 00:46:00.020
have a lot of respect for us,
because we are very serious

00:46:00.020 --> 00:46:04.070
about these challenges and
try to, kind of, be balanced

00:46:04.070 --> 00:46:08.180
and diplomatic about,
you know, our rights.

00:46:08.180 --> 00:46:13.260
I am not just professional in
the Indian Law Resource Center,

00:46:13.260 --> 00:46:15.040
I was Indian leader, you know.

00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:17.730
So I can also keep the
lawyers in balance too.

00:46:17.730 --> 00:46:20.630
And from the scientific
perspective,

00:46:20.630 --> 00:46:25.080
as an electrical
engineer, you know.

00:46:25.080 --> 00:46:29.420
So we have a different
view in this world

00:46:29.420 --> 00:46:33.750
when we face these issues.

00:46:33.750 --> 00:46:36.170
So it's very challenging.

00:46:36.170 --> 00:46:41.360
And I hope that our young
people can also follow

00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:43.260
that in the future.

00:46:43.260 --> 00:46:46.880
We trying to train
our young leaders.

00:46:46.880 --> 00:46:49.790
But it's very hard because
of the economic aspect

00:46:49.790 --> 00:46:51.090
of Leo was talking about.

00:46:51.090 --> 00:46:54.360
Because, you know, a
lot of young people,

00:46:54.360 --> 00:46:56.890
a lot of our interns
or fellows that come

00:46:56.890 --> 00:47:01.500
to our office want
to do what we do.

00:47:01.500 --> 00:47:05.060
They love excitement,
but then they all left

00:47:05.060 --> 00:47:06.990
to federal government
to pay back

00:47:06.990 --> 00:47:10.420
after they become
lawyers or professionals.

00:47:10.420 --> 00:47:13.340
I want other professional,
not just lawyers.

00:47:13.340 --> 00:47:15.380
But they have to
pay back their--

00:47:15.380 --> 00:47:16.680
&gt;&gt; Carrie N. Lyons: It's true.

00:47:16.680 --> 00:47:17.980
&gt;&gt; Armstrong Wiggins:
So it's very hard

00:47:17.980 --> 00:47:19.290
to do human rights
work, you know.

00:47:19.290 --> 00:47:23.160
And that's the challenges
that we face too.

00:47:23.160 --> 00:47:25.320
&gt;&gt; Carrie N. Lyons: So, we have
a few more minutes, and I wanted

00:47:25.320 --> 00:47:27.690
to open it up to questions,
if anybody has any.

00:47:27.690 --> 00:47:28.990
So, yes, sir?

00:47:28.990 --> 00:47:34.150
&gt;&gt; Audience: According you, sir,
over in Nicaragua, you cut out,

00:47:34.150 --> 00:47:37.710
according to use
the Panama Canal,

00:47:37.710 --> 00:47:41.370
construct with huge
Chinese companies.

00:47:41.370 --> 00:47:46.950
I want to hear your view
about this canal construction.

00:47:46.950 --> 00:47:49.670
I'm sure the environmental
destruction,

00:47:49.670 --> 00:47:53.690
and effecting indigenous
peoples in the area.

00:47:53.690 --> 00:47:58.480
Could you give me your
opinion about this?

00:47:58.480 --> 00:47:59.780
&gt;&gt; Armstrong Wiggins: Yes.

00:47:59.780 --> 00:48:02.240
Nicaragua government is
now populist government.

00:48:02.240 --> 00:48:04.520
You know what populist
government means.

00:48:04.520 --> 00:48:07.940
You have one here.

00:48:07.940 --> 00:48:10.790
But there, more dictators
than here yet.

00:48:10.790 --> 00:48:12.090
Because they have check

00:48:12.090 --> 00:48:13.630
and balance here in
the United States.

00:48:13.630 --> 00:48:16.650
I hope we don't lose
that check and balances.

00:48:16.650 --> 00:48:20.350
I hope we hang on to that
so we can challenge the

00:48:20.350 --> 00:48:21.650
executive branch.

00:48:21.650 --> 00:48:25.230
But in Nicaragua, they control
all of the government branches,

00:48:25.230 --> 00:48:31.730
whether the legislative,
the legal branches,

00:48:31.730 --> 00:48:34.830
and the military, the police,

00:48:34.830 --> 00:48:37.980
and control the election
process also.

00:48:37.980 --> 00:48:42.670
And so they negotiated with this
Chinese guy, individual guy,

00:48:42.670 --> 00:48:47.060
and they decided to pass
this Law 84 that is very,

00:48:47.060 --> 00:48:48.950
very bad against
indigenous people

00:48:48.950 --> 00:48:51.810
and peasants-- poor people.

00:48:51.810 --> 00:48:55.460
And then Nicaragua Lake,
it is the biggest lake

00:48:55.460 --> 00:48:59.140
that have freshwater, and
we have freshwater shark,

00:48:59.140 --> 00:49:02.170
and that freshwater species.

00:49:02.170 --> 00:49:04.850
Nicaragua Lake give
water supply--

00:49:04.850 --> 00:49:09.690
drinking water to
Chontales, which is one

00:49:09.690 --> 00:49:13.080
of the biggest states.

00:49:13.080 --> 00:49:14.380
Or [foreign language].

00:49:14.380 --> 00:49:17.710
And then Rivas, which
is another big state

00:49:17.710 --> 00:49:19.840
that get drinking water.

00:49:19.840 --> 00:49:22.290
Can you imagine opening
up a canal

00:49:22.290 --> 00:49:24.420
from the Pacific
to the Atlantic.

00:49:24.420 --> 00:49:26.450
Then, when you go to the
Atlantic, you're dealing

00:49:26.450 --> 00:49:30.080
with indigenous people,
the Rama Indian and Creole,

00:49:30.080 --> 00:49:33.660
block communities that feel like
they are also, like, indigenous.

00:49:33.660 --> 00:49:34.960
They live there.

00:49:34.960 --> 00:49:36.470
And they got to live

00:49:36.470 --> 00:49:39.210
for themselves, so
a block community.

00:49:39.210 --> 00:49:42.980
Their land is also owned
collectively, not individually.

00:49:42.980 --> 00:49:44.700
And all that is going
to be affected.

00:49:44.700 --> 00:49:47.770
Can you imagine all
the shark will die

00:49:47.770 --> 00:49:50.680
when saltwater comes in?

00:49:50.680 --> 00:49:53.980
And so everybody is
fighting against that.

00:49:53.980 --> 00:49:58.390
And seems like the guy
who's the individual,

00:49:58.390 --> 00:50:02.140
very rich individual, it looks
like he lost a lot of money

00:50:02.140 --> 00:50:05.510
in the crisis in China
with the stock market.

00:50:05.510 --> 00:50:08.930
And so it's kind of calmed down.

00:50:08.930 --> 00:50:12.950
We are hoping that Chinese
government is not behind that.

00:50:12.950 --> 00:50:17.110
And we are hoping that because
Panama Canal is just being

00:50:17.110 --> 00:50:20.760
renovated, make it wider,
the big ship can pass.

00:50:20.760 --> 00:50:23.240
The reason they wanted to
do it through Nicaragua is

00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:26.520
because Asian ships,
some of them are huge,

00:50:26.520 --> 00:50:28.420
that couldn't go through Panama.

00:50:28.420 --> 00:50:32.230
So they wanted to build a canal
bigger, through Nicaragua.

00:50:32.230 --> 00:50:35.730
But what happened is Nicaragua
is wider, longer to cross,

00:50:35.730 --> 00:50:39.950
more expensive, and one
of the biggest problem is,

00:50:39.950 --> 00:50:42.320
Nicaraguan government
cannot protect

00:50:42.320 --> 00:50:45.330
from terrorist attack
against a ship.

00:50:45.330 --> 00:50:48.740
So it has to be very
powerful country to protect

00:50:48.740 --> 00:50:51.180
like how US protect
Panama Canal.

00:50:51.180 --> 00:50:53.310
And it has to be China.

00:50:53.310 --> 00:50:57.280
But China is not that
far, yet, to do say-so.

00:50:57.280 --> 00:51:00.460
We don't know because we
understand the US is also

00:51:00.460 --> 00:51:02.470
pushing China not to do that.

00:51:02.470 --> 00:51:04.930
So it's on hold right now.

00:51:04.930 --> 00:51:08.060
But we don't know what
can happen going forward.

00:51:08.060 --> 00:51:14.310
&gt;&gt; Carrie N. Lyons: Did
you have a question?

00:51:14.310 --> 00:51:15.620
Yeah, yeah?

00:51:15.620 --> 00:51:19.370
&gt;&gt; Audience: [inaudible]
for your presentation.

00:51:19.370 --> 00:51:23.480
For one, you have a very
good insight about a problem,

00:51:23.480 --> 00:51:25.960
and you recognize it
according to your efforts.

00:51:25.960 --> 00:51:29.420
But, on the other hand, I think
you are saying you cannot have a

00:51:29.420 --> 00:51:33.400
resources to tackle
individual cases.

00:51:33.400 --> 00:51:37.630
The problem is you allow them
to divide individual then,

00:51:37.630 --> 00:51:42.000
eventually, you have
a nation from them

00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:45.120
where they face all
individual who want to donate,

00:51:45.120 --> 00:51:47.710
but they don't have the
resource, because their land,

00:51:47.710 --> 00:51:53.630
their home, their estate, their
income are all victimized.

00:51:53.630 --> 00:51:56.090
So eventually, you are
going to have some kind

00:51:56.090 --> 00:51:58.970
of unjust influence
by those big donors,

00:51:58.970 --> 00:52:03.300
maybe financial institution,
maybe some NGO.

00:52:03.300 --> 00:52:06.910
They get their money from
Chamber of Commerce, or lawyers.

00:52:06.910 --> 00:52:10.000
So I think, probably,
eventually, you may have dues,

00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:11.670
but you may have a
better [inaudible]

00:52:11.670 --> 00:52:14.710
and you've victimized
all your people.

00:52:14.710 --> 00:52:19.400
So how you going to solve that,
unless you try some effort?

00:52:19.400 --> 00:52:22.700
How do you connect with
other good people whose civic

00:52:22.700 --> 00:52:27.450
organization may not be
an NGO, may not be NAACP?

00:52:27.450 --> 00:52:30.610
But you must have
somebody to work with you

00:52:30.610 --> 00:52:32.050
to solve the individual problem.

00:52:32.050 --> 00:52:34.180
Otherwise you are going
to have vicious cycle.

00:52:34.180 --> 00:52:37.250
So I just want to
know, would you be able

00:52:37.250 --> 00:52:39.090
to do some effort in that?

00:52:39.090 --> 00:52:40.640
Because that would
be American problem

00:52:40.640 --> 00:52:41.960
that would be Indian
problem too.

00:52:41.960 --> 00:52:44.030
&gt;&gt; Carrie N. Lyons: I'm not
really sure of the question.

00:52:44.030 --> 00:52:45.330
&gt;&gt; What is the question,
I don't know.

00:52:45.330 --> 00:52:47.050
&gt;&gt; Audience: That question
is, can you be able

00:52:47.050 --> 00:52:50.490
to solve the individual
problem based off

00:52:50.490 --> 00:52:52.810
of justice and fairness?

00:52:52.810 --> 00:52:54.780
You are talking about
America have check

00:52:54.780 --> 00:52:56.280
and balance, but
I don't think so.

00:52:56.280 --> 00:52:59.360
Because everything is
controlled by those

00:52:59.360 --> 00:53:01.760
in bloody interest group.

00:53:01.760 --> 00:53:05.250
And the individual
are not protected.

00:53:05.250 --> 00:53:10.360
So you are basing it on private
donation that individual cases.

00:53:10.360 --> 00:53:12.320
If they don't want to donate,
they don't have resources

00:53:12.320 --> 00:53:14.780
to donate because
they are victimized.

00:53:14.780 --> 00:53:18.050
&gt;&gt; Carrie N. Lyons:
Right, well, I think.

00:53:18.050 --> 00:53:19.600
&gt;&gt; Audience: -- donation,
unless, I said,

00:53:19.600 --> 00:53:23.480
the big corporation or
the financial institution

00:53:23.480 --> 00:53:26.530
who are working to
victimize you even further.

00:53:26.530 --> 00:53:29.810
Maybe individually you
don't even have that.

00:53:29.810 --> 00:53:31.110
&gt;&gt; Carrie N. Lyons: Well,

00:53:31.110 --> 00:53:33.480
I'm not really sure what the
question is, but I think it goes

00:53:33.480 --> 00:53:36.100
to the difference between taking

00:53:36.100 --> 00:53:38.680
on cases collectively
or individually.

00:53:38.680 --> 00:53:41.920
&gt;&gt; The basic question is
really, you must do some cost

00:53:41.920 --> 00:53:44.410
about justice and fairness.

00:53:44.410 --> 00:53:47.410
Not based on who is
giving you donation.

00:53:47.410 --> 00:53:48.710
&gt;&gt; Carrie N. Lyons:
Right, right.

00:53:48.710 --> 00:53:51.620
And, I mean, I think you've
somewhat addressed those

00:53:51.620 --> 00:53:54.000
questions when you talk
about how you pick cases

00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:56.480
and where you get the
money from and, yeah.

00:53:56.480 --> 00:53:59.430
&gt;&gt; Leonardo A. Crippa: Yeah,
so thank you for your question.

00:53:59.430 --> 00:54:03.160
There are some issues, maybe,

00:54:03.160 --> 00:54:05.730
that will help you,
help all of us.

00:54:05.730 --> 00:54:12.670
We have various different
projects through which we try

00:54:12.670 --> 00:54:18.330
to reform laws and policies
that will, eventually,

00:54:18.330 --> 00:54:21.220
improve the situation
at whole communities

00:54:21.220 --> 00:54:23.930
and individual members
of that communities,

00:54:23.930 --> 00:54:27.740
in developing countries
and in the US.

00:54:27.740 --> 00:54:31.260
One of those programs
is actually in nature,

00:54:31.260 --> 00:54:34.900
where we take a case,
we represent a community

00:54:34.900 --> 00:54:38.430
or a people against, it
might be a government agency

00:54:38.430 --> 00:54:43.940
or a company, and we use the
legal system of that country.

00:54:43.940 --> 00:54:50.920
Other programs include
influencing policies

00:54:50.920 --> 00:54:56.300
of public sector financial
institutions, like, for example,

00:54:56.300 --> 00:55:01.030
the World Bank Group, where you
will find International Monetary

00:55:01.030 --> 00:55:06.120
Fund, the International
Financial Corporation,

00:55:06.120 --> 00:55:08.630
the International
Bank Reconstruction.

00:55:08.630 --> 00:55:12.440
The government will not hold
bank, and other regional banks,

00:55:12.440 --> 00:55:15.280
like, for example, the
Inter-American Government back.

00:55:15.280 --> 00:55:18.620
And what we've done since the
80s and the [inaudible] program,

00:55:18.620 --> 00:55:23.610
where we work on policies,
is push these banks

00:55:23.610 --> 00:55:29.680
to create a policy, a safer
policy that aims preventing harm

00:55:29.680 --> 00:55:31.990
to communities and
the environment,

00:55:31.990 --> 00:55:34.780
through the projects
that they finance.

00:55:34.780 --> 00:55:38.670
And so, even though, some
countries and some donors

00:55:38.670 --> 00:55:44.340
with money with pressure these
institutions to have policies.

00:55:44.340 --> 00:55:46.570
So that those getting funds
from these institutions,

00:55:46.570 --> 00:55:49.720
in some cases, in
developing countries,

00:55:49.720 --> 00:55:52.280
in other trans-national
corporations operating

00:55:52.280 --> 00:55:55.790
in developing countries,
would have to comply

00:55:55.790 --> 00:55:57.440
with the safe parts
of this policy.

00:55:57.440 --> 00:56:04.400
For example, we got the
World Bank, in 1981,

00:56:04.400 --> 00:56:07.010
to adopt the first
indigenous people's policy.

00:56:07.010 --> 00:56:11.220
In 2006, we got the
Inter-American Development Bank,

00:56:11.220 --> 00:56:14.220
for the first time, to
approve an operational policy

00:56:14.220 --> 00:56:15.880
on indigenous peoples.

00:56:15.880 --> 00:56:18.230
We are now working
with indigenous peoples

00:56:18.230 --> 00:56:19.530
in our organization in Brazil

00:56:19.530 --> 00:56:22.690
to get the Brazilian
Development Bank

00:56:22.690 --> 00:56:27.510
to develop its first operational
policy on indigenous peoples.

00:56:27.510 --> 00:56:28.810
And, at the same time,

00:56:28.810 --> 00:56:34.280
we educate donors how important
it is to provide support

00:56:34.280 --> 00:56:36.820
to indigenous peoples
from the ground

00:56:36.820 --> 00:56:38.480
that are fighting corruption,

00:56:38.480 --> 00:56:40.680
that are fighting
government agencies trying

00:56:40.680 --> 00:56:43.950
to get their lands, conservation
organizations trying

00:56:43.950 --> 00:56:46.810
to manage their natural
resources.

00:56:46.810 --> 00:56:49.760
And sometimes we get
supports, sometimes not.

00:56:49.760 --> 00:56:53.690
But we find ways to work through
the legal system of the country

00:56:53.690 --> 00:56:56.440
or this international
organization.

00:56:56.440 --> 00:57:00.210
So that we can either get
an international instrument,

00:57:00.210 --> 00:57:03.670
like the declarations on the
rights of indigenous peoples,

00:57:03.670 --> 00:57:07.420
or ban policies on indigenous
peoples in an actual case

00:57:07.420 --> 00:57:10.610
to change the way indigenous
peoples are treated sometimes.

00:57:10.610 --> 00:57:13.050
I hope that clarifies
this a bit.

00:57:13.050 --> 00:57:16.000
&gt;&gt; Armstrong Wiggins: I think
also, to try to understand,

00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:20.600
when you say, a vicious
circle, what I want you

00:57:20.600 --> 00:57:23.200
to understand that, we,
from our perspective,

00:57:23.200 --> 00:57:26.540
we do respect collective
and individual rights.

00:57:26.540 --> 00:57:28.050
We respect that.

00:57:28.050 --> 00:57:35.270
I was jailed in my territory,
my people defended me.

00:57:35.270 --> 00:57:36.990
That's why I'm alive.

00:57:36.990 --> 00:57:40.300
I was arrested in Managua,
Nicaragua, in the capital

00:57:40.300 --> 00:57:43.970
from my office, close to
the [inaudible] office.

00:57:43.970 --> 00:57:48.470
I was defended through
my individual rights,

00:57:48.470 --> 00:57:51.370
not collective rights,
through my villages, OK?

00:57:51.370 --> 00:57:55.490
So, sometimes it benefits us
and we respect one aspect of it.

00:57:55.490 --> 00:57:57.640
But let me just tell you one
example what just happened

00:57:57.640 --> 00:57:59.300
to us not too long ago.

00:57:59.300 --> 00:58:03.090
We, trying to get
money from law offices,

00:58:03.090 --> 00:58:05.440
but there're sometimes
conflict of interest.

00:58:05.440 --> 00:58:08.010
We had been trying to get
money from corporation,

00:58:08.010 --> 00:58:09.310
but sometimes there
might be conflict

00:58:09.310 --> 00:58:12.050
of interest, from corporation.

00:58:12.050 --> 00:58:13.350
We got some money

00:58:13.350 --> 00:58:15.220
from Mitsubishi Foundation
in New York.

00:58:15.220 --> 00:58:18.550
It's this Japanese car
maker's foundation.

00:58:18.550 --> 00:58:23.760
We decided, maybe, we can get
that to work with the red issue

00:58:23.760 --> 00:58:25.830
that you heard about,
talk about.

00:58:25.830 --> 00:58:27.130
This is environmental issue.

00:58:27.130 --> 00:58:30.100
Environmental is know what
is red, a red program.

00:58:30.100 --> 00:58:33.120
The European come up with a
list environmental thinking.

00:58:33.120 --> 00:58:37.200
The first one is gift,
then now red, OK?

00:58:37.200 --> 00:58:40.620
Which mean the, what they were,
if you have a lot of trees,

00:58:40.620 --> 00:58:44.000
you can get money from your
trees that is in your yard or is

00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:45.300
in your community, OK?

00:58:45.300 --> 00:58:46.710
That's red program.

00:58:46.710 --> 00:58:48.640
So Mitsubishi was
interested in that.

00:58:48.640 --> 00:58:52.640
But when we met with that, we
didn't know when we decided

00:58:52.640 --> 00:58:56.620
to represent indigenous people
in Mexico about the wind issues

00:58:56.620 --> 00:58:58.240
that I just talk about.

00:58:58.240 --> 00:59:01.210
One of the biggest money
was coming from Mitsubishi

00:59:01.210 --> 00:59:03.680
and Inter-American
Development Bank.

00:59:03.680 --> 00:59:09.590
And so Mitsubishi said, you
stop representing the Indians

00:59:09.590 --> 00:59:11.500
or we will not give
you the money.

00:59:11.500 --> 00:59:16.840
And we said, we will not stop
it, you can stop the money.

00:59:16.840 --> 00:59:18.440
And that's what we did, OK?

00:59:18.440 --> 00:59:19.740
Something that--

00:59:19.740 --> 00:59:21.040
&gt;&gt; Carrie N. Lyons:
It's a balance, yeah.

00:59:21.040 --> 00:59:22.340
&gt;&gt; Armstrong Wiggins:
It's a balance.

00:59:22.340 --> 00:59:23.640
So I just wanted to
clarify that too.

00:59:23.640 --> 00:59:24.940
&gt;&gt; Carrie N. Lyons: So
I think we have time

00:59:24.940 --> 00:59:27.160
for one last question.

00:59:27.160 --> 00:59:30.450
&gt;&gt; Audience: You have in
Guatemala, which has almost half

00:59:30.450 --> 00:59:32.230
of its population indigenous.

00:59:32.230 --> 00:59:34.780
And they have been
considering a law

00:59:35.830 --> 00:59:40.170
that would recognize
indigenous law to some degree.

00:59:41.220 --> 00:59:43.660
But it stalled, in part,
because of objections

00:59:43.660 --> 00:59:47.440
from business communities
that might be able

00:59:47.440 --> 00:59:50.430
to exploit natural
resources, indigenous lands,

00:59:50.430 --> 00:59:51.740
and for other reasons.

00:59:51.740 --> 00:59:58.190
So I wanted to know if you could
discuss how can indigenous law,

00:59:58.190 --> 01:00:03.380
with its main emphasis
on collective property,

01:00:03.380 --> 01:00:05.290
collective right, coexist
with, like, the national laws

01:00:05.290 --> 01:00:08.090
of a country like Guatemala that
emphasizes individual rights?

01:00:08.090 --> 01:00:13.260
How can you have those
two function and coexist?

01:00:14.350 --> 01:00:15.670
&gt;&gt; Leonardo A. Crippa: There
are some precedents still

01:00:15.670 --> 01:00:17.040
in Guatemala.

01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:23.580
I remember a decision issued
by the Conditional Court

01:00:23.580 --> 01:00:28.920
where it was a Supreme Court
case against [inaudible],

01:00:28.920 --> 01:00:31.080
a member of my community,

01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:37.700
after the Maya approached his
community and applies a sanction

01:00:37.700 --> 01:00:44.880
against him because
of behavior that was

01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:48.150
against the community's
traditions.

01:00:48.150 --> 01:00:50.610
But, anyway, his case ended

01:00:50.610 --> 01:00:55.440
up in the Guatemala
criminal system.

01:00:55.440 --> 01:01:00.990
So that case brought to
the conventional courts,

01:01:00.990 --> 01:01:05.500
the conditional court
basically said indigenous people

01:01:05.500 --> 01:01:09.600
of Guatemala have a legal system

01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:13.370
in which they can
resort authorities.

01:01:13.370 --> 01:01:18.440
And a policy where criminal
issues have been addressed

01:01:18.440 --> 01:01:23.550
by the own community, the
state courts cannot reduce

01:01:23.550 --> 01:01:27.630
to persecute those that
haven't already been sanctioned

01:01:27.630 --> 01:01:28.930
by traditional groups.

01:01:28.930 --> 01:01:31.660
So that court, the
traditional court,

01:01:31.660 --> 01:01:33.800
applied what is non-criminal
law.

01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:40.340
They [inaudible], which
means, no one tell me subject

01:01:40.340 --> 01:01:42.750
to criminal charges once.

01:01:42.750 --> 01:01:47.740
But that's just one
example, and one precedent.

01:01:47.740 --> 01:01:53.180
And I remember this because a
lawmaker [inaudible] was one

01:01:53.180 --> 01:01:57.470
of the authorities [inaudible]
members of my community.

01:02:01.110 --> 01:02:05.750
And the controversy around
collective land rights

01:02:05.750 --> 01:02:11.070
and the country's
legal system oriented

01:02:11.070 --> 01:02:15.410
to protect private property,

01:02:15.410 --> 01:02:19.280
that's not such a
big controversy

01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:27.080
because there are already
laws in Guatemala that tend

01:02:27.080 --> 01:02:31.470
to protect collective lands.

01:02:31.470 --> 01:02:36.250
Like, for example, the
law that the created the--

01:02:36.250 --> 01:02:38.040
it is called the
[foreign language].

01:02:38.040 --> 01:02:42.390
That basically will execute and
enforce all of the agrarian laws

01:02:42.390 --> 01:02:45.550
that were passed by
Congress in Guatemala.

01:02:45.550 --> 01:02:50.480
And that law, it tries to
provide some protection

01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:52.820
for peasant communities.

01:02:52.820 --> 01:02:58.070
In that way, it was
good objective.

01:02:58.070 --> 01:03:00.110
But it wasn't, at the same time,

01:03:00.110 --> 01:03:03.670
not as good because indigenous
peoples were included there

01:03:03.670 --> 01:03:06.190
as peasant communities,
until we solved all

01:03:06.190 --> 01:03:08.230
of the agrarian policies
are applied

01:03:08.230 --> 01:03:11.960
to indigenous communities

01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:14.400
as though they were
peasant communities,

01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:16.440
without consider their legal
nature as indigenous people.

01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:21.400
We call this right are
recognized by international law

01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:23.680
in the paper and so forth.

01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:26.900
So there are some precedents
in both court positions

01:03:26.900 --> 01:03:30.820
and in actual legislation
that tend

01:03:30.820 --> 01:03:33.700
to protect collective
[inaudible] lands.

01:03:33.700 --> 01:03:37.890
But, unfortunately, Guatemala,
there is no actual legislation

01:03:37.890 --> 01:03:42.470
that recognizes indigenous
people's communities legal

01:03:42.470 --> 01:03:46.650
personality, nor their
collective ownership

01:03:46.650 --> 01:03:48.410
over the lands that
they possess.

01:03:48.410 --> 01:03:51.140
And that is why we started them,

01:03:51.140 --> 01:03:54.990
whenever there is a conservation
project on Indian lands,

01:03:54.990 --> 01:03:59.250
or a constructive energy
project on native lands.

01:03:59.250 --> 01:04:03.420
But, I would say, the best way
to work towards a reconciliation

01:04:03.420 --> 01:04:07.350
of these different laws
or legal approaches is

01:04:07.350 --> 01:04:11.570
by making indigenous
peoples sit at the table

01:04:11.570 --> 01:04:15.460
and have an ad hoc
conversation with them.

01:04:15.460 --> 01:04:19.030
So that when we stand here,
them, and they can participate

01:04:19.030 --> 01:04:21.230
in the development
of [inaudible].

01:04:21.230 --> 01:04:26.520
And that is something that
already happened in Peru.

01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:28.900
The consultation
that was [inaudible].

01:04:32.200 --> 01:04:34.250
&gt;&gt; Armstrong Wiggins: I think
it's a very good question,

01:04:34.250 --> 01:04:37.400
and sometimes have
me sleepless nights.

01:04:37.400 --> 01:04:44.350
And I remember when Kofi Annan
was the Secretary-General

01:04:44.350 --> 01:04:45.650
of the UN.

01:04:45.650 --> 01:04:49.420
He went to Bolivia for the first
time, and then he came back.

01:04:49.420 --> 01:04:52.230
And he called me up and
said, can we have lunch?

01:04:52.230 --> 01:04:55.640
So I had lunch with him
right at 8th Street.

01:04:55.640 --> 01:04:57.920
Now we get famous.

01:04:57.920 --> 01:05:03.560
And one of Kofi Annan
question to me was Armstrong.

01:05:03.560 --> 01:05:08.480
I know that Bolivian
are indigenous majority,

01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:09.880
just like Guatemala.

01:05:09.880 --> 01:05:13.390
But he didn't go to Guatemala,
he was coming from Bolivia.

01:05:13.390 --> 01:05:18.230
And he said, but how
can we find a leader

01:05:18.230 --> 01:05:21.800
that can bring everybody
together instead

01:05:21.800 --> 01:05:27.920
of taking what happened
to them to take to go

01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:31.250
against the minority,
non-indigenous people.

01:05:31.250 --> 01:05:35.220
How we find, in Bolivia,
something what happened

01:05:35.220 --> 01:05:39.710
in South Africa, you know,
by South African leader?

01:05:39.710 --> 01:05:42.570
And so it's a tough question.

01:05:42.570 --> 01:05:44.780
I said, I don't have the answer.

01:05:44.780 --> 01:05:50.160
We just-- education is key
to do, to do that, you know,

01:05:50.160 --> 01:05:52.180
like what happened
in South Africa.

01:05:52.180 --> 01:05:54.910
Even though he was in jail
that long, became president

01:05:54.910 --> 01:05:58.570
and he worked with everybody
and pulled everybody together.

01:05:58.570 --> 01:06:01.030
Guatemala situation
is the same thing.

01:06:01.030 --> 01:06:04.760
And yet, if you think
about in China,

01:06:04.760 --> 01:06:06.780
it's a communist country, right?

01:06:06.780 --> 01:06:10.940
China? China economy is
taking all of our bills here

01:06:10.940 --> 01:06:13.150
in the United States
because China keep pulling

01:06:13.150 --> 01:06:14.450
out of our debt, right?

01:06:14.450 --> 01:06:21.370
And so, what's going on in
China is now they're bringing

01:06:21.370 --> 01:06:25.590
to their politburo,
all the rich people.

01:06:25.590 --> 01:06:27.630
But they can't question
the collectivity,

01:06:27.630 --> 01:06:30.350
the corporative system
of Chinese system

01:06:30.350 --> 01:06:32.740
of government, you know.

01:06:32.740 --> 01:06:35.510
So one of the thing that
we're thinking, hoping,

01:06:35.510 --> 01:06:41.870
is that we get education to
all indigenous communities.

01:06:41.870 --> 01:06:45.720
That they can become
voting power.

01:06:45.720 --> 01:06:47.560
And it's not hard.

01:06:47.560 --> 01:06:52.790
In Guatemala, probably
60% in majority.

01:06:52.790 --> 01:06:58.340
Can you imagine if they vote in
what your founding fathers said,

01:06:58.340 --> 01:07:00.610
our founding fathers said here?

01:07:00.610 --> 01:07:04.810
That educated people
can vote the right way

01:07:04.810 --> 01:07:07.370
that who they believe
can be a good leader.

01:07:07.370 --> 01:07:10.600
That's not what happened
in Guatemala, OK?

01:07:10.600 --> 01:07:15.010
So if they can vote their
own president, Mayan leader

01:07:15.010 --> 01:07:18.300
like [inaudible] will
become the president.

01:07:18.300 --> 01:07:20.550
But we're not there yet.

01:07:20.550 --> 01:07:24.410
Even Inter-American Court of
Human Rights, in San Jose,

01:07:24.410 --> 01:07:31.220
Costa Rica, which is the OAS
Inter-American System ruled

01:07:31.220 --> 01:07:33.040
with the case of
Yatama vs. Nicaragua.

01:07:33.040 --> 01:07:35.130
And they ruled in favor

01:07:35.130 --> 01:07:37.700
of indigenous people
have the rights

01:07:37.700 --> 01:07:41.610
to have election
according to their history,

01:07:41.610 --> 01:07:44.560
according to their
culture, not enforced

01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:48.400
by the capital city
political parties.

01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:50.380
If that happened in Guatemala,

01:07:50.380 --> 01:07:54.460
and I'm Indian person can be
offered this in Guatemala.

01:07:54.460 --> 01:07:56.250
But we're not there yet.

01:07:56.250 --> 01:07:59.880
And so if Indian person can
be in Guatemala, president,

01:07:59.880 --> 01:08:02.610
and negotiate with the
business community,

01:08:02.610 --> 01:08:06.050
I'm sure they can meet
in the middle ground

01:08:06.050 --> 01:08:10.500
to have a better life for
indigenous [inaudible].

01:08:10.500 --> 01:08:11.800
They can negotiate that.

01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:13.440
But we're not there yet.

01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:15.610
But it will happen,
I'm telling you.

01:08:15.610 --> 01:08:18.160
Not in my lifetime,
but in the future,

01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:22.900
that probably will happen,
because they're the majority.

01:08:22.900 --> 01:08:24.200
&gt;&gt; Carrie N. Lyons: OK,

01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:25.500
so I'm getting the
signal we should wrap up.

01:08:25.500 --> 01:08:26.990
But I'd like to thank you
both again for coming out.

01:08:26.990 --> 01:08:28.290
This was wonderful.

01:08:28.290 --> 01:08:29.590
We are so grateful
to have you here.

01:08:29.590 --> 01:08:30.890
And I'd also like
to thank everybody

01:08:30.890 --> 01:08:32.290
for spending time with us today.

01:08:32.290 --> 01:08:34.090
Thank you.

01:08:34.090 --> 01:08:37.350
[ Applause ]
