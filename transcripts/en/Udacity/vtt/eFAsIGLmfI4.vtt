00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:02.520
There are two ways to add classes.

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.070
&gt;From the previous screen, you can
just click the check box over here,

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:07.000
then click Register.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.980
I'm going to go ahead and register for
Software Architecture and Design.

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.340
That will take you to
the Schedule screen.

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.520
Here we'll see your Current Schedule.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.670
You'll see here the class for
which you just registered.

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:22.610
&gt;&gt; However, you might want to do
some advanced planning instead.

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:25.090
Remember that CRN column
on the previous screen?

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:26.800
You can use this to register too.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.730
Before your Registration window opens,

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.210
write down the CRN numbers of the
classes for which you want to register.

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.100
So in this case,
I would write down 90097,

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.120
which is the CRN number for
Software Architecture and Design.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.990
Back on the Registration screen,
I'm going to click Add or Drop Classes.

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:45.810
This will take me back to the Schedule
screen that you saw earlier.

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.781
At the bottom, you can enter
the CRN numbers for the classes for

00:00:48.781 --> 00:00:50.136
which you want to register.

00:00:50.136 --> 00:00:56.680
So I would enter 90097, and
then click Submit Changes.

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.960
Just like before, now you'll see
that class in your Current Schedule.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.280
That way, when registration opens,
you can come directly to this screen and

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.900
just enter the CRN numbers for the
classes for which you want to register.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.838
&gt;&gt; Note that this process
might not be successful.

00:01:09.838 --> 00:01:13.190
If I try to register for more hours
than I'm allowed, for example,

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:14.890
I'll see an error message.

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.970
So after registering, make sure that
the class appears in your schedule.

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:20.580
If not, look for an error.
