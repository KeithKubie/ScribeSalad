00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:02.450
In the Netherlands,
a 55-year-old woman

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:05.620
visited her doctor with
a very strange complaint.

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:09.230
She was having spontaneous
orgasms from her feet.

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:15.850
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:16.450
Hey, friends.

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:17.730
Laci Green here for D News.

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.670
It's not every day that
you hear about someone

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:21.310
having orgasms from their feet.

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:23.410
But today, today
is a special day.

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:25.297
The woman is known
only as Mrs. A.

00:00:25.297 --> 00:00:27.380
And according to her case
study released this week

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.100
by the Journal of
Sexual Medicine,

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.130
she was having sudden orgasmic
sensations five to six times

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.135
a day from her feet--
well, actually,

00:00:34.135 --> 00:00:36.464
her foot, her left
foot, to be exact.

00:00:36.464 --> 00:00:38.880
Now, I know some of you all
out there are probably feeling

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:39.838
pretty jolly right now.

00:00:39.838 --> 00:00:41.830
Like, hey, I want foot orgasms.

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:44.130
But she actually hated it.

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:46.150
It would happen randomly,
without any sort

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.107
of sexual thoughts or arousal,
and who knows what company.

00:00:49.107 --> 00:00:50.690
Imagine you're going
through your day,

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.880
and every other hour it's
like, really, another one?

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.240
The doctor said she
felt really embarrassed,

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.480
and she wanted it
to stop immediately.

00:00:58.480 --> 00:00:59.680
So, what was going on?

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.220
Well, about a year before this
started, she was in a coma

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:03.850
because she had sepsis.

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.440
When she came out, she did
have some strange sensations

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.950
in that same foot
because of nerve damage.

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.720
Still, that shouldn't
cause orgasms in your feet.

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.680
So they did an MRI scan,
found nothing, did an EMG,

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.410
found nothing, put an electrical
current through her foot,

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:20.760
and then came the orgasms.

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.340
What they believe happened
is that her brain basically

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.170
got confused.

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.040
Sensory information from the
foot and from the genitals

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.980
enter the spinal cord
at the same time.

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:31.180
So after the nerves in
her foot regenerated,

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.220
the brain was no longer able
to tell them what was vagina

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:35.620
and what was left foot.

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.610
Your feet and your genitals
may be far apart on your body,

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.400
but in your brain,
they're like best buds.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.670
Feet and the genitals sit
right next to each other

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.370
in the somatosensory
homunculus, which

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:46.720
is your brain's sensory map.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.450
Add some neural crosstalk,
and bam, foot orgasms.

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.590
Fortunately, her fix
was swift and easy.

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.010
An injection of anesthetic
into her spinal nerve

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:56.170
cleared the problem up.

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.130
Interestingly to me,
this sensory map mix-up

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.370
also happens to be the
predominant explanation

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:02.570
for foot fetishes.

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.270
Feet are the single most common
non-genital sexual fetish

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.014
in the world.

00:02:07.014 --> 00:02:08.639
In the same way that
someone else might

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:12.540
be aroused by genitals, a foot
fetishist is aroused by feet.

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.540
There have been lots of
other theories put forth

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.940
in the past about why feet are a
focus of so much sexual energy.

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.590
Perhaps it's a
forbidden fruit effect.

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.620
They're mysterious
and sexy because you

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.060
don't see feet as much.

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.870
Freud said it's because
feet look like a penis.

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.170
But then again, Freud thinks
everything looks like a penis.

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.650
Perhaps it's sexy
because we associate

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.225
with power and respect,
what with kissing or washing

00:02:34.225 --> 00:02:35.350
someone's feet.

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.080
Kind of interesting
ideas, but still,

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.200
can't go wrong with
some solid neurology.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.900
So since the curious case
of Mrs. A's foot orgasms,

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.290
the doctors believe it's
possible there are more people

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.760
out there struggling with
unwanted orgasms and shame.

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.370
So they've set up a website
about foot orgasm syndrome

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.620
to reach out and conduct
further research the matter.

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:53.920
So I'll link to that below.

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:54.820
Thanks for joining me, guys.

We post up extra science
bits there all week.

Bye bye.
