00:00:00.712 --> 00:00:02.014
Voiceover: So in the
last couple of videos,

00:00:02.014 --> 00:00:03.663
we've talked about Benjamin Franklin

00:00:03.663 --> 00:00:06.180
as a printer, we've talked about him as a

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.297
successful public leader, as a successful

00:00:09.297 --> 00:00:12.148
businessman, but we also
know Benjamin Franklin,

00:00:12.148 --> 00:00:13.980
and we've talked about him
as a successful writer,

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.064
with Poor Richard's
Almanac, but there's this

00:00:17.064 --> 00:00:18.598
other side of Benjamin
Franklin which kind of

00:00:18.598 --> 00:00:20.598
makes him larger than
life, which he was also

00:00:20.598 --> 00:00:23.349
a significant scientist.

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:25.263
Voiceover: Yes, you know,
he would have thought

00:00:25.263 --> 00:00:28.681
it was strange that you could aspire to be

00:00:28.681 --> 00:00:31.102
a great citizen and
not care about science.

00:00:31.102 --> 00:00:32.847
Back then, you should know about science.

00:00:32.847 --> 00:00:34.962
So he did everything from tried to track

00:00:34.962 --> 00:00:38.658
the gulf stream, he
discovered ways to use dark

00:00:38.658 --> 00:00:41.930
fabrics to absorb heat,
he creates the great

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.948
Franklin stove, a fireplace
that's a wonderful

00:00:44.948 --> 00:00:50.363
way to be more efficient
in terms of heating

00:00:50.363 --> 00:00:53.347
a room without getting
it all smoky, and...

00:00:53.347 --> 00:00:54.363
Voiceover: And also not wasting the heat

00:00:54.363 --> 00:00:56.115
I think, normally in a
fireplace all the heat

00:00:56.115 --> 00:00:57.863
goes straight up, and out.

00:00:57.863 --> 00:01:00.681
Voiceover: Right, and it
sort of had a nice little

00:01:00.681 --> 00:01:04.380
top to it, a little plate,
that got very hot, and so

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:06.780
he was a very practical inventor.

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.014
Even things like bifocals,
he's riding along

00:01:10.014 --> 00:01:12.647
the road one day, and he keeps wanting to

00:01:12.647 --> 00:01:15.580
read, but then look up
into the distance, and

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.329
he says, "Well, why
don't I have two pieces

00:01:17.329 --> 00:01:19.430
"of glass melded together, one that's good

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.454
"for reading, and one
that's good for looking

00:01:21.454 --> 00:01:23.014
out in the distance."

00:01:23.014 --> 00:01:26.981
So, it wasn't like he
was a research scientist,

00:01:26.981 --> 00:01:29.447
he was just a practical inventor.

00:01:29.447 --> 00:01:32.148
What makes him into a
great research scientist

00:01:32.148 --> 00:01:37.348
is when finally, in the
1740s and early 1750s,

00:01:37.348 --> 00:01:41.597
he starts doing the
electricity experiments.

00:01:41.597 --> 00:01:42.779
Voiceover: And this is
important, this is actually

00:01:42.779 --> 00:01:44.681
something I learned
when I read your book on

00:01:44.681 --> 00:01:46.514
Benjamin Franklin, is that,

00:01:46.514 --> 00:01:48.379
I mean this was real, as you mentioned,

00:01:48.379 --> 00:01:49.529
this was real research.

00:01:49.529 --> 00:01:51.764
This was something that, understanding the

00:01:51.764 --> 00:01:54.631
nature of elecricity,
the nature of lightning,

00:01:54.631 --> 00:01:56.315
and how to manipulate it.

00:01:56.315 --> 00:01:57.980
Voiceover: Yeah, we think
of him as a doddering old

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:01.598
dude flying a kite in
the rain, but in fact,

00:02:01.598 --> 00:02:03.430
those electricity
experiments were the most

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.981
important experiments of that era.

00:02:06.981 --> 00:02:10.120
Not only for the practical use of them,

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:11.613
but for the theory.

00:02:11.613 --> 00:02:14.430
Up until then, people had
created static electricity,

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:15.879
you know, when you rub
your sweater against a

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:19.014
piece of glass, and lots of
sparks come out, and they

00:02:19.014 --> 00:02:21.863
thought that electricity
was two different fluids,

00:02:21.863 --> 00:02:24.046
and they had two different
names for the fluids.

00:02:24.046 --> 00:02:27.599
Franklin realizes it's
a single fluid, and he

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:31.313
creates the idea of positive and negative,

00:02:31.313 --> 00:02:33.564
plus and minus, those
type of things, so that

00:02:33.564 --> 00:02:36.813
it's a flow of electricity,
and he does that

00:02:36.813 --> 00:02:39.231
with his electricity
experiments that really begin

00:02:39.231 --> 00:02:43.198
in the 1740s, partly as
a parlor trick, 'cause

00:02:43.198 --> 00:02:45.947
he loves it, but then he
realizes, no, let's study

00:02:45.947 --> 00:02:47.432
this stuff - electricity.

00:02:47.432 --> 00:02:49.598
Voiceover: And it was a
real issue, I mean people

00:02:49.598 --> 00:02:52.030
were dying because of lightning.

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.981
I remember in the book,
there was a particularly

00:02:53.981 --> 00:02:56.080
funny, I forgot the exact
quote, where he said,

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.747
"Churches get to be, tend to be hit

00:02:58.747 --> 00:03:00.598
"disproportionately, so it seems like God

00:03:00.598 --> 00:03:02.047
"is not favoring them." (laughing)

00:03:02.047 --> 00:03:04.197
Voiceover: Right, well you
know what they used to do,

00:03:04.197 --> 00:03:07.697
was they would sanctify
the church bells, so that

00:03:07.697 --> 00:03:10.279
it would ward off the
lightning, and they would

00:03:10.279 --> 00:03:12.796
even sometimes store gunpowder inside

00:03:12.796 --> 00:03:14.747
churches with sanctified bells.

00:03:14.747 --> 00:03:17.330
But the lightning kept
hitting the steeples of the

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.916
churches, and people in
Germany, Italy, and then

00:03:20.916 --> 00:03:25.063
the United States, there
were these huge explosions,

00:03:25.063 --> 00:03:27.130
lightning was the great
scourge of the times.

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:28.329
Voiceover: So to ward off lightning,

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:30.181
they would sanctify a metal bell,

00:03:30.181 --> 00:03:31.432
and put it at the top of the tower.

00:03:31.432 --> 00:03:32.681
Voiceover: Bingo! (laughing)

00:03:32.681 --> 00:03:34.446
It did not work!

00:03:34.446 --> 00:03:38.763
And Franklin has a wonderful
line in one of his letters

00:03:38.763 --> 00:03:41.681
which is, "You'd think
we would try something

00:03:41.681 --> 00:03:44.314
different, and see if
that worked." (chuckling)

00:03:44.314 --> 00:03:48.148
And so Franklin looks at
sparks, that he's been

00:03:48.148 --> 00:03:50.629
looking at from his
electricity experiments,

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:52.881
and he's been creating these little sparks

00:03:52.881 --> 00:03:55.697
with the static
electricity, but then using

00:03:55.697 --> 00:03:58.697
wire to make it into
a flow of electricity,

00:03:58.697 --> 00:04:00.437
and put it into a battery.

00:04:00.437 --> 00:04:02.013
He gives us the name "battery" 'cause he

00:04:02.013 --> 00:04:04.197
puts it together a lot of Leyden jars,

00:04:04.197 --> 00:04:06.848
which is the way they
used to store electricity.

00:04:06.848 --> 00:04:09.796
And so he's looking at
the similarity between

00:04:09.796 --> 00:04:12.113
sparks and lightning.

00:04:12.113 --> 00:04:15.880
And in his notebook, he
makes a little chart.

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.212
He said, well sparks have these qualities,

00:04:18.212 --> 00:04:20.462
they're fast, they jump,
there's a sulfurous

00:04:20.462 --> 00:04:23.879
smell, they make a little
crack, and lightning

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:25.730
has the same qualities.

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:28.113
And he does a wonderful
notation at the bottom

00:04:28.113 --> 00:04:31.046
of that notebook page,
very scientist-like,

00:04:31.046 --> 00:04:34.863
he says, "Let the experiments be made."

00:04:34.863 --> 00:04:37.563
And that's how you get
the lightning experiments.

00:04:37.563 --> 00:04:40.148
Voiceover: He literally,
it's a little bit of a

00:04:40.148 --> 00:04:43.764
legend now, but he
literally did go out into

00:04:43.764 --> 00:04:47.612
a rainstorm and tie a
kite with a silk thread,

00:04:47.612 --> 00:04:51.247
to a kind of a key
attached to a Leyden jar?

00:04:51.247 --> 00:04:53.681
Voiceover: Well, what he did was as clouds

00:04:53.681 --> 00:04:56.996
were passing over, he and his son William

00:04:56.996 --> 00:05:00.263
went out into a field,
and as the rain started,

00:05:00.263 --> 00:05:03.640
they flew the kite, and
they tried to draw the

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:06.167
electricity down from
the clouds, 'cause it was

00:05:06.167 --> 00:05:08.928
his theory that a
lightning strike was just

00:05:08.928 --> 00:05:11.480
a spark coming out of a cloud.

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:14.564
And at first it didn't
work, but as the cloud got

00:05:14.564 --> 00:05:18.047
nearer, he could see
the little fibers on the

00:05:18.047 --> 00:05:21.813
silk get raised, and
there was a key at the end

00:05:21.813 --> 00:05:26.063
of it, and that's where the electricity,

00:05:26.063 --> 00:05:29.296
the charge collected, and then he was able

00:05:29.296 --> 00:05:33.264
to put it into a Leyden jar, or a battery.

00:05:33.264 --> 00:05:34.981
Voiceover: So really what
he was doing, is he was

00:05:34.981 --> 00:05:37.265
connecting, because the
clouds are getting a,

00:05:37.265 --> 00:05:38.597
they're kind of at a different electric

00:05:38.597 --> 00:05:41.598
potential up here, by
kind of connecting it

00:05:41.598 --> 00:05:43.797
with his conducting
silk thread that's wet,

00:05:43.797 --> 00:05:45.862
he was able kind of to get the Leyden jar

00:05:45.862 --> 00:05:47.514
to save potential.

00:05:47.514 --> 00:05:50.425
It wasn't like the lightning
struck like Back to the Future.

00:05:50.425 --> 00:05:50.876
Voiceover: No, it wasn't like

00:05:50.876 --> 00:05:54.347
lightning striking him,
he was drawing some

00:05:54.347 --> 00:05:57.348
of the charge down from
the cloud, but that

00:05:57.348 --> 00:06:01.480
showed him that what
lightning was, was a discharge

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:04.107
from the cloud of its electric potential.

00:06:04.107 --> 00:06:06.432
Voiceover: Right, and that's significant,

00:06:06.432 --> 00:06:08.197
'cause when he figured
that out, that you could

00:06:08.197 --> 00:06:11.281
manipulate electric, that
lighting was electricity,

00:06:11.281 --> 00:06:14.680
that he could kind of
solve the church problem.

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:16.296
Voiceover: The big, big
problem, and you look at that

00:06:16.296 --> 00:06:19.098
kite you've drawn, what
does that show you?

00:06:19.098 --> 00:06:22.780
It says, I get it, if we put
something up there like that,

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:25.830
like a lightning rod,
and he knew that pointed

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:29.947
metal objects were very
good at drawing the flow

00:06:29.947 --> 00:06:33.598
of electricity, so he
said, why don't we put up

00:06:33.598 --> 00:06:37.231
a lightning rod, and he
described exactly how to do it.

00:06:37.231 --> 00:06:40.441
They ended up testing it
in France, first, 'cause he

00:06:40.441 --> 00:06:44.848
published the lightning
rod way of doing it,

00:06:44.848 --> 00:06:48.297
but later on he replicates the experiments

00:06:48.297 --> 00:06:50.431
in the United States,
and it makes him the most

00:06:50.431 --> 00:06:53.314
famous person probably, other than maybe

00:06:53.314 --> 00:06:55.649
the King of France, and
the King of England,

00:06:55.649 --> 00:06:57.648
the most famous person
in the world because

00:06:57.648 --> 00:07:03.897
he has solved this
astonishingly big problem

00:07:03.897 --> 00:07:06.247
of how do we ward off lightning from

00:07:06.247 --> 00:07:07.680
striking our building.

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:09.030
Voiceover: Especially tall buildings like

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:11.348
church and castle towers, and this is

00:07:11.348 --> 00:07:14.098
where he saves lives, this is a...

00:07:14.098 --> 00:07:16.181
Voiceover: Oh saves hundreds of lives,

00:07:16.181 --> 00:07:19.280
by far the most important
invention of the time,

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:21.682
and of course, we still
use lightning rods,

00:07:21.682 --> 00:07:24.973
we still ground, have
grounded points on top

00:07:24.973 --> 00:07:26.368
of buildings to make sure...

00:07:26.368 --> 00:07:28.681
Voiceover: It's a very
simple idea, that you give

00:07:28.681 --> 00:07:30.997
kind of this pointed conductor point,

00:07:30.997 --> 00:07:32.564
that's really high up,
the lightning will want

00:07:32.564 --> 00:07:35.348
to strike that, and then
you construct a path

00:07:35.348 --> 00:07:41.956
for the lightning, so
it can go to the ground,

00:07:41.956 --> 00:07:43.813
and not have to go through the building.

00:07:43.813 --> 00:07:45.731
Voiceover: And what he does in his house

00:07:45.731 --> 00:07:48.112
in Philadelphia, especially
'cause he's about to go

00:07:48.112 --> 00:07:50.446
to England again at the time, he puts up

00:07:50.446 --> 00:07:53.251
a lightning rod, he
grounds it, but he puts

00:07:53.251 --> 00:07:56.680
a tiny little bell, so
that when the electricity's

00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:59.514
coming down from the storm is approaching,

00:07:59.514 --> 00:08:02.063
and it's drawing the electrical charge

00:08:02.063 --> 00:08:05.029
from the clouds, a tiny
little bell will sort of

00:08:05.029 --> 00:08:07.932
bounce back and forth, being jolted by the

00:08:07.932 --> 00:08:11.181
charges coming there, and
it drove Deborah Read,

00:08:11.181 --> 00:08:14.098
his wife, absolutely to distraction,

00:08:14.098 --> 00:08:16.196
so there's a wonderful
letter he writes home

00:08:16.196 --> 00:08:18.515
from England, telling her how to dismantle

00:08:18.515 --> 00:08:20.946
the bell, and it will still be safe.

00:08:20.946 --> 00:08:23.222
Voiceover: Fascinating.
