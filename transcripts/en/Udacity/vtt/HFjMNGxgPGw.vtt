00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:04.310
In this lesson we have introduced
the P versus NP problem.

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:08.090
As we said in the beginning, the class
P informally captures the problems

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:11.190
we can solve efficiently on a computer,
and the class NP

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.510
captures the problems whose answers we
can verify efficiently on a computer.

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:19.110
Our experience with finding a clique in
a graph is just that these two classes

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:20.310
are not the same.

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.150
Cliques are hard to find,
but they are easy to check.

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.300
Intuitively solving a difficult
problem should be harder

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:27.470
than just checking a solution.

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.439
Nevertheless, no one has been able
to prove that P is not equal to NP.

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:36.720
Whether these two classes are equivalent
is known as the P versus NP question and

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.040
is the most important problem in
theoretical computer science today.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.140
If not in all of mathematics.

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.280
We'll discuss the full implications
of the question in a later lecture.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.110
But for now,
I'll just mention that in the year 2000,

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.430
the Clay Mathematics Institute
named the P versus NP problem

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.220
as one of the seven most important
open questions in mathematics.

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:59.290
And has offered a $1 million bounty for
a proof that determines whether or

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:00.790
not P equals NP.

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:04.239
Fame and fortune await the person that
settles the P versus NP problem, but

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:05.319
many have tried and failed.

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.500
Next class we look at
the NP complete problems.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:10.970
The hardest problems in NP.
