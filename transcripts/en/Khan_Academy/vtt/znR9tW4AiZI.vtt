00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:03.150
We're now going to do a few
examples to actually show

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:06.320
you why the trig functions
are actually useful.

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:08.760
So let's get started
with a problem.

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.065
Let's say I have this
right triangle.

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:17.040
That's my right triangle.

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:22.470
There's the right angle.

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.950
And let's say I know that
the measure of this angle

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:31.710
is pi over 4 radians.

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.980
And I'll just write
rad for short.

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.230
If the measure of this angle is
pi over 4 radians, and I also

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.900
know that this side of the
triangle-- this side right

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:48.080
here-- is 10 square roots of 2.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.970
So I know this side
of the triangle.

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.690
I know this angle, which
is pi over 4 radians.

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.420
And now, the question is, what
is this side of the triangle?

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.410
I'm going to highlight that.

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.680
And let me make it in orange.

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:07.900
So let's figure out what
we know and what we

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.390
need to figure out.

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.500
We know the angle,
pi over 4 radians.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.970
And actually, turns out if
you were to convert that

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.290
to degrees, it would
be 45 degrees.

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.120
And we know-- what
side is this?

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.440
This is the hypotenuse
of the triangle, right?

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.130
And what are we trying
to figure out?

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.720
Are we trying to figure out
the hypotenuse, the adjacent

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.390
side to the angle, or the
opposite side to the angle?

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.540
Well, this is the hypotenuse,
we already know that.

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:33.430
This is the opposite side.

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:41.090
This is the opposite side.

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.080
And this yellow side is
the adjacent side, right?

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.260
It's just adjacent
to this angle.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:50.150
So we know the angle, we know
the hypotenuse, and we want to

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.060
figure out the adjacent side.

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.240
So let me ask you a question.

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.910
What trig function deals
with the adjacent side

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:00.360
and the hypotenuse?

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.620
Because we have the adjacent
side is what we want

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.005
to figure out, and we
know the hypotenuse.

00:02:04.005 --> 00:02:05.770
Well, let's write down
our mnemonic, just in

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.390
case you forgot it.

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:08.836
SOHCAHTOA.

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.650
So which one uses
adjacent and hypotenuse?

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.990
Right?

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:21.750
It's CAH.

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.770
And CAH, the c is for what?

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:27.150
The c is for cosine.

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.980
Cosine of an angle-- let's just
call it any angle-- is equal to

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.870
the adjacent over
the hypotenuse.

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.460
So let's use this information
to try to solve for this orange

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.790
side, or this yellow side.

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:48.350
So we know that cosine of pi
over 4 radians-- so let's say

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:55.580
cosine of pi over 4-- must
equal this adjacent

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:56.820
side right here.

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.190
Let's just call that
a. a for adjacent.

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.030
The adjacent side divided
by the hypotenuse.

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:05.540
The hypotenuse is this side.

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.590
And in the problem, we
were given that it's

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:08.730
10 square roots of 2.

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.790
So we can solve for a by
multiplying both sides of

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.130
this equation by 10
square roots of 2.

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.180
And we will get--
because, right?

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.650
If we just multiply times
10 square root of 2,

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:26.580
these cancel out.

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.650
And then you get a 10
square root of 2 here.

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:37.840
So you get a is equal to 10
square roots of 2 times

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.710
the cosine of pi over 4.

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:45.860
Now you're probably saying,
Sal, this does not look too

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:50.170
simple, and I don't know how
big the cosine of pi over 4 is.

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:51.450
What do I do?

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.650
Well, no one has the trig
functions, or the values of

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:56.450
the trig functions memorized.

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:57.730
There's a couple
of ways to do it.

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.710
Either I could give you what
the cosine of pi over 4 is.

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:02.270
That's sometimes
given in a problem.

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:05.400
Or you can make sure that your
calculator is set to radians

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.400
and you can just type in pi
divided by 4-- which is roughly

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.530
0.79-- and then press
the cosine button.

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:13.960
You finally know
what it's good for.

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:15.250
And you'll get a value.

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.370
Or-- and this is kind of the
old school way of doing it--

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.554
there are trig tables where
you could look up what cosine

00:04:20.554 --> 00:04:22.540
of pi over 4 is in a table.

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.430
Since I don't have any of that
at my disposal right now,

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.040
I'll just tell you what the
cosine of pi over 4 is.

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:35.760
The cosine of pi over 4 is
square root of 2 over 2.

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.970
So a, which is the adjacent
side-- a for adjacent-- is

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:46.470
equal to 10 square roots of 2
times square root of 2 over 2.

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:48.750
Remember, to get the square
root of 2 over 2, you might

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:49.330
be a little confused.

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.210
You're like, how
did Sal get that?

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:54.420
All I said is, the cosine
of pi over 4 is square

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:55.090
root of 2 over 2.

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:57.010
And that's not something that--
well, actually, this one you

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:59.420
might know offhand, because
of the 45 degree angle.

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:01.490
But this isn't something
that people memorize.

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:03.275
This is something you would
look up, or it's given in

00:05:03.275 --> 00:05:05.660
the problem, or you'd
use a calculator for.

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:07.610
And a calculator, of course,
wouldn't give you square

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:08.020
root of 2 over 2.

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:11.910
It'd give you a decimal
number that's not obviously

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:13.180
square root of 2 over 2.

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:15.800
But anyway, I told you that the
cosine of pi over 4 is the

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.310
square root of 2 over 2.

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:20.050
And so if we multiply, what's
the square root of 2 over 2?

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:22.560
What's the square root of 2
times the square root of 2?

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:23.140
It's 2.

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:26.690
So that's 2, and then that
cancels with that 2.

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:29.570
And so everything cancels
except for the 10.

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:32.340
So the adjacent side
is equal to 10.

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:36.140
Let's do another one.

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:45.230
Let me delete this.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.180
Give me 1 second.

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:54.550
I'm actually-- this is one of
the few modules that I'm not

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:56.770
generating the problems on the
fly, because I need to make

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:59.200
sure that I actually have
the trig function values

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:00.920
before I do the problem.

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:05.820
So let's say I have
another right triangle.

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:07.470
I probably shouldn't have
deleted that last one.

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:11.320
So let's see, this is
my right triangle.

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:13.350
How much time do I have--
about 4 minutes left.

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:14.700
Should be enough.

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:16.880
So this is my right triangle.

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:23.470
And I know the angle--
let's call this--.

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:29.970
I know this angle right
here is 0.54 radians.

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:38.240
And I also know that this side
right here is 3 units long.

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:42.680
And I want to figure
out this side.

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:45.390
So what do I know?

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:49.300
Well, this side is what side
relative to the angle?

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:50.930
It's the opposite side, right?

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:52.760
Because the angle is here, and
we go opposite the angle.

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:55.110
So this is the opposite side.

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:56.080
And what's this side?

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:59.220
Is this the adjacent side,
or is it the hypotenuse?

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:00.370
Well, this is the
hypotenuse, right?

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:02.600
The long side, and it's
opposite the right angle.

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:05.070
So this is the adjacent side.

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:08.510
So what trig function uses
opposite and adjacent?

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:10.400
Let's write down
SOHCAHTOA again.

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:10.760
SOHCAHTOA.

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:17.160
TOA uses opposite and adjacent.

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:17.420
OA.

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:22.540
So T for tangent, right?

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:23.840
TOA.

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:30.280
So tangent is equal to
opposite over adjacent.

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:31.520
So let's use that.

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:35.040
So let's take the tangent
of 0.54 radians.

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:44.320
So the tangent of 0.54 will
equal the side opposite to it.

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:46.600
So that's 3, right?

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:48.070
The opposite side is 3.

00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:49.750
Over the adjacent side.

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:51.550
Well, once again, the adjacent
side is what we don't know.

00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:55.520
So we have to solve for a.

00:07:55.520 --> 00:08:03.020
So if we multiply both sides
by a, we get a tan of 0.54--

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:08.860
we could do that because we
know it's not 0-- equals 3.

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:18.240
Or a is equal to 3 divided
by the tangent of 0.54.

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:22.500
So once again, I don't have
memorized what the tangent of

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:29.770
0.54 is, but I will tell you
what it is because you also

00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:30.480
don't have it memorized.

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:31.990
Or you could use a calculator
to figure it out if you

00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:34.060
had a radian function.

00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:39.730
The tangent of 0.54 is equal
to-- let me make sure

00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:41.080
I have this right.

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:41.960
Oh, right.

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:45.270
The tangent of 0.54 is 3/5.

00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:51.830
So then a is equal
to 3 over 3/5.

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:56.850
Right, the adjacent side--
now, once again, how

00:08:56.850 --> 00:08:57.810
did I get this 3/5?

00:08:57.810 --> 00:08:58.820
Well, I just told you.

00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:00.200
Or you can use a calculator
to know that the

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:03.250
tangent of 0.54 is 3/5.

00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:05.130
And of course, I'm using
numbers that work out

00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:07.400
well, just so that the
fractions all cancel.

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:09.580
So we know that the adjacent
side is equal to-- when you

00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:12.550
divide by fractions, it's like
multiplying by the numerator.

00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:14.420
Multiplying by the inverse.

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:17.430
So times 5/3.

00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:20.370
So the adjacent side
is equal to 5.

00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:21.120
There.

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:21.930
There you go.

00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:23.870
So let's just think
about what I always do.

00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:27.190
I think about what I have,
what sides I have, and what

00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:28.210
side I want to solve for.

00:09:28.210 --> 00:09:30.130
And in this case, it was the
opposite side I had, and I

00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:31.740
wanted to solve for
the adjacent side.

00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:35.170
And I said, what trig function
involves those 2 sides?

00:09:35.170 --> 00:09:36.940
The opposite and the adjacent.

00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:37.880
I wrote down SOHCAHTOA.

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:39.410
I said, oh, TOA.

00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:40.370
Opposite and adjacent.

00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:41.320
That's tan.

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:43.500
So I took the tan of the angle.

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:45.960
And then I said, the tan of the
angle is equal to the opposite

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:47.820
side divided by the
adjacent side.

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:48.780
That's right here.

00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:50.430
And then I just solved
for the adjacent side.

00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:52.740
And of course, I used a
calculator, or I told you

00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:55.880
what the tangent of 0.54 is.

00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:58.110
I think I'll do a couple more
of these problems in the next

00:09:58.110 --> 00:09:59.960
module, but I'm out
of time for now.

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:01.480
Have fun.
