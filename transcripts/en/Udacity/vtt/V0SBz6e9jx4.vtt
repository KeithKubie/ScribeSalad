00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.100
So, what we're going to get out of feature transformation is

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.820
the ability to combine these features, these words, somehow, into

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:09.260
some new space where hopefully we will do a better

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:12.820
job of eliminating our false positives and false negatives by combining

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:16.059
words together. So, we're going to leave this example for now,

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:18.460
but just to give you an intuition about how a proper

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.930
kind of feature transformation might help you just let me

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:25.600
point out that if I type in a word like car,

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:30.450
you would expect, since I know what car kind of means. Let's say automobiles in

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:32.810
this case, I should pick up documents or

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:36.290
score documents higher if they don't contain the

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:38.500
word car, but they do contain the word

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.300
automobile. Or perhaps they contain a word like

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:46.780
motor or race track. Or Tesla, right, that

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.540
somehow words like Tesla, and automobile, and motorway,

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.410
and anything else you can think of that has

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.760
to do with cars probably are highly correlated or highly

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.770
related to cars in some way. And so, it would

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.950
make sense to combine words like automobile and car together

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:04.430
into new features to pick up documents that are

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.680
somehow related together that way. Does that make sense? So

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.910
that's the intuition I want you to think of for

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:12.200
the three algorithms that we're going to go over next. Okay?

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.960
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I could definitely see how synonymy is

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.840
going to be a win, when we index the documents,

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.830
if we include, well, if we map them down to a

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:22.332
lower dimensional feature space where one feature's used for anything sort of

00:01:22.332 --> 00:01:24.410
car related. I'm not sure how that's going to help with polysemy, but

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.940
I definitely see how this feature transformation idea could be a win

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.675
with synonymy. The way, so that's right, and I think it's, it's

00:01:30.675 --> 00:01:33.410
much easier to see how it works with synonomy then with polysemy.

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:36.680
The way it will, it could in principle help you with polysemy

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.140
is that it will combine a bunch of features that together eliminate

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.430
the ambiguity of any particular word. So as you type in

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.050
more words together it'll start to pick those thing up while also

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:52.350
eliminating synonomy. So we'll see. The way it's going to work in practice

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.240
actually is that if you think of it. Now we are talking

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.400
about unsupervised learning. But if you think of this as a

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.350
supervised learning problem, then you can imagine how you can ask yourself

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.850
how to combine sets of these features, these words together such that

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.322
they can still give you correct labels. And if you can solve

00:02:07.322 --> 00:02:08.919
that problem you will end up solving both

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:12.210
polysemy and synonomy. Or at least minimizing their impact.

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.860
&gt;&gt; Cool.

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.572
&gt;&gt; OK. So let's go over this specific example to

00:02:15.572 --> 00:02:18.900
far more abstract examples and talk about three specific algorithms. .
