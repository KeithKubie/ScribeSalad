It is a mark of character to be thought of
as someone that others can safely confide

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:16.390
in; there is a high degree of empathy, generosity
and open-mindedness implied in being the person

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:23.099
that friends instinctively turn to when everything
has gone dark. But we may come to realise

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:29.289
that, despite our best intentions, often others
do not quite see us in this way. If we ask

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:34.160
them directly what the matter is, they try
to look cheerful and insist that everything

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:40.300
is fine. We know it can’t be but nor do
they seem inclined to open up to us. We end

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:46.070
up lonely and a little helpless. There are
plenty of good reasons why people tend to

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:53.070
show extreme care before opening up. A confidant
may turn out to be patronising, alarmist,

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:59.671
sentimental, panic-inducing or moralistic.
The dangers of humiliation can be acute. To

00:00:59.671 --> 00:01:05.159
dare to confide, we need a strong feeling
that our companion is going to be unreservedly

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.610
understanding, gentle and kindly. But even
if we feel ready to be all these things, how

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.780
do we signal our capacities properly to others people?

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:20.240
The almost touchingly obvious method is via
direct assertion. We might say: don’t worry,

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.810
I won’t judge or simply: you can tell me,
I’m very understanding. Kind though such

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:31.070
statements may be, they can’t generally
help because they don’t touch the core fear

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:36.610
that – whatever we may say – we may still
turn out to be disturbed by, or hostile to,

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:42.570
the details of actual revelations. The more
skilled approach requires a greater degree

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:48.920
of courage on our part. It involves regularly
admitting to something difficult and troubling

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:54.820
and rather shameful about ourselves. It’s
by letting others know something of our own

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:01.060
vulnerabilities that we free them up to share
some of the things they are terrified of admitting

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:06.870
in their lives. Our revelation proves far
better than a headline statement that we are

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:12.470
reliable because we know from the inside what
it’s like to carry a dreadful secret and

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.950
to feel frightened of another person’s reaction
to it. We’re demonstrating a crucial idea:

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:26.680
that we won’t turn on them because we’ve
trusted them not to turn on us. The process

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:32.390
of building up trust often functions in an
incremental way: we reveal a small and not

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.530
too awful fact about us, and the other then
starts to share a little of what’s going

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:42.069
on for them. From there, we take a bolder
step of admitting to something more significantly

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:47.739
awkward: something we know could be seen as
really not very acceptable. We’re inviting

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:53.370
the other to follow us in turn and to feel
secure in opening their hearts yet wider.

The underlying idea is that in order to demonstrate

00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:02.900
our position as an empathetic receiver of
confidences, we have to show our broken and

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:09.530
flawed sides: we’ve failed, so another can
tell us of their failure; we’ve been hurt

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:15.580
so, they can admit to being hurt; we’ve
done, and admitted we’ve done, very stupid

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:21.530
things so we’re not going to turn against
those who have also been at points very silly.

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:27.940
To be a good companion, it isn’t enough
simply to be polite or to commiserate. We

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:35.290
need to take a risk. We need to give our friends
something they could use against us – so

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:41.220
that they can feel safe in giving us something
we might use against them. Under the umbrella

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.800
of mutually assured destruction, real trust
and friendship

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.160
can then flourish.
