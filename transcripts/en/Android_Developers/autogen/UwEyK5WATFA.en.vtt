00:10:11.519 --> 00:10:14.780
we've built a configuration change
system to deal with that folding and

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:14.790
system to deal with that folding and
 

00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:16.249
system to deal with that folding and
unfolding the device will be treated as

00:10:16.249 --> 00:10:16.259
unfolding the device will be treated as
 

00:10:16.259 --> 00:10:18.829
unfolding the device will be treated as
a configuration change in the screen

00:10:18.829 --> 00:10:18.839
a configuration change in the screen
 

00:10:18.839 --> 00:10:23.090
a configuration change in the screen
size and screen layout categories and to

00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:23.100
size and screen layout categories and to
 

00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:25.069
size and screen layout categories and to
support you with that the Android system

00:10:25.069 --> 00:10:25.079
support you with that the Android system
 

00:10:25.079 --> 00:10:27.350
support you with that the Android system
by default recreates your activities

00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:27.360
by default recreates your activities
 

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:29.570
by default recreates your activities
when it's in a configuration change

00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:29.580
when it's in a configuration change
 

00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:33.170
when it's in a configuration change
and this has the advantage of taking

00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:33.180
and this has the advantage of taking
 

00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:36.650
and this has the advantage of taking
care of any layout changes you might

00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:36.660
care of any layout changes you might
 

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:40.160
care of any layout changes you might
want to make then taking advantage of

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:40.170
want to make then taking advantage of
 

00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:42.440
want to make then taking advantage of
the new configuration but it also means

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:42.450
the new configuration but it also means
 

00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:45.500
the new configuration but it also means
that you as the app are responsible for

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:45.510
that you as the app are responsible for
 

00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:47.360
that you as the app are responsible for
restoring the state the user was in

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:47.370
restoring the state the user was in
 

00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:51.290
restoring the state the user was in
after that activity is recreated to

00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:51.300
after that activity is recreated to
 

00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:53.329
after that activity is recreated to
support it with that we have the unsafe

00:10:53.329 --> 00:10:53.339
support it with that we have the unsafe
 

00:10:53.339 --> 00:10:56.800
support it with that we have the unsafe
instance state facility and we're also

00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:56.810
instance state facility and we're also
 

00:10:56.810 --> 00:10:59.569
instance state facility and we're also
introducing a new check back library

00:10:59.569 --> 00:10:59.579
introducing a new check back library
 

00:10:59.579 --> 00:11:01.400
introducing a new check back library
called view model to support you with

00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:01.410
called view model to support you with
 

00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:05.569
called view model to support you with
that alternatively you could also decide

00:11:05.569 --> 00:11:05.579
that alternatively you could also decide
 

00:11:05.579 --> 00:11:07.400
that alternatively you could also decide
to handle the configuration change

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:07.410
to handle the configuration change
 

00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:10.940
to handle the configuration change
yourself by it just applying it and

00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:10.950
yourself by it just applying it and
 

00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:14.269
yourself by it just applying it and
adjusting your layout to do that you can

00:11:14.269 --> 00:11:14.279
adjusting your layout to do that you can
 

00:11:14.279 --> 00:11:15.680
adjusting your layout to do that you can
declare that you can handle the

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:15.690
declare that you can handle the
 

00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:17.060
declare that you can handle the
configuration change in your Android

00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:17.070
configuration change in your Android
 

00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:19.940
configuration change in your Android
manifest but that means that you'll have

00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:19.950
manifest but that means that you'll have
 

00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:22.819
manifest but that means that you'll have
to manually adjust the layout to the new

00:11:22.819 --> 00:11:22.829
to manually adjust the layout to the new
 

00:11:22.829 --> 00:11:26.079
to manually adjust the layout to the new
screen size and new configuration and

00:11:26.079 --> 00:11:26.089
screen size and new configuration and
 

00:11:26.089 --> 00:11:27.949
screen size and new configuration and
for the best experience

00:11:27.949 --> 00:11:27.959
for the best experience
 

00:11:27.959 --> 00:11:30.079
for the best experience
make sure to correctly implement

00:11:30.079 --> 00:11:30.089
make sure to correctly implement
 

00:11:30.089 --> 00:11:32.329
make sure to correctly implement
multi-window and to declare your

00:11:32.329 --> 00:11:32.339
multi-window and to declare your
 

00:11:32.339 --> 00:11:38.510
multi-window and to declare your
activity as resizable now next up we're

00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:38.520
activity as resizable now next up we're
 

00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:40.819
activity as resizable now next up we're
making some changes to the life cycle in

00:11:40.819 --> 00:11:40.829
making some changes to the life cycle in
 

00:11:40.829 --> 00:11:43.130
making some changes to the life cycle in
multi-window you can see the current

00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:43.140
multi-window you can see the current
 

00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:46.340
multi-window you can see the current
behavior on the left and that is that

00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:46.350
behavior on the left and that is that
 

00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:49.010
behavior on the left and that is that
only the activity that the user last

00:11:49.010 --> 00:11:49.020
only the activity that the user last
 

00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:51.260
only the activity that the user last
touched is in the resumed state while

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:51.270
touched is in the resumed state while
 

00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:53.019
touched is in the resumed state while
all the others are in the past state

00:11:53.019 --> 00:11:53.029
all the others are in the past state
 

00:11:53.029 --> 00:11:56.269
all the others are in the past state
that's a bit confusing to users because

00:11:56.269 --> 00:11:56.279
that's a bit confusing to users because
 

00:11:56.279 --> 00:11:59.690
that's a bit confusing to users because
it's not immediately obvious why the why

00:11:59.690 --> 00:11:59.700
it's not immediately obvious why the why
 

00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:01.519
it's not immediately obvious why the why
one activity is a bit more interactive

00:12:01.519 --> 00:12:01.529
one activity is a bit more interactive
 

00:12:01.529 --> 00:12:04.010
one activity is a bit more interactive
and by other activists are in a less

00:12:04.010 --> 00:12:04.020
and by other activists are in a less
 

00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:07.579
and by other activists are in a less
interactive state and it's also one more

00:12:07.579 --> 00:12:07.589
interactive state and it's also one more
 

00:12:07.589 --> 00:12:09.290
interactive state and it's also one more
thing you have to keep in mind as a

00:12:09.290 --> 00:12:09.300
thing you have to keep in mind as a
 

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:12.400
thing you have to keep in mind as a
developer when you target multi-window

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:12.410
developer when you target multi-window
 

00:12:12.410 --> 00:12:15.110
developer when you target multi-window
so to make things simpler we're

00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:15.120
so to make things simpler we're
 

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:18.260
so to make things simpler we're
introducing multi resume mode a multi

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:18.270
introducing multi resume mode a multi
 

00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:20.810
introducing multi resume mode a multi
resume mode it's pretty simple really

00:12:20.810 --> 00:12:20.820
resume mode it's pretty simple really
 

00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:23.240
resume mode it's pretty simple really
all the activities in multi window that

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:23.250
all the activities in multi window that
 

00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:25.910
all the activities in multi window that
are at the top and are visible are all

00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:25.920
are at the top and are visible are all
 

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:31.550
are at the top and are visible are all
in the resume state now Android piden

00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:31.560
in the resume state now Android piden
 

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:33.019
in the resume state now Android piden
ship with this with this behavior

00:12:33.019 --> 00:12:33.029
ship with this with this behavior
 

00:12:33.029 --> 00:12:35.840
ship with this with this behavior
originally and so we're making this an

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:35.850
originally and so we're making this an
 

00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:38.900
originally and so we're making this an
opt-in behavior in android pi it will

00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:38.910
opt-in behavior in android pi it will
 

00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:40.910
opt-in behavior in android pi it will
only be applied if both the app

00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:40.920
only be applied if both the app
 

00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:43.570
only be applied if both the app
developer opt-in and the device

00:12:43.570 --> 00:12:43.580
developer opt-in and the device
 

00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:46.060
developer opt-in and the device
sure actually implements this feature

00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:46.070
sure actually implements this feature
 

00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:50.590
sure actually implements this feature
according to our spec but note that in

00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:50.600
according to our spec but note that in
 

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:52.210
according to our spec but note that in
future versions of Android we are

00:12:52.210 --> 00:12:52.220
future versions of Android we are
 

00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:54.700
future versions of Android we are
expecting it to we are expecting to make

00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:54.710
expecting it to we are expecting to make
 

00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:58.420
expecting it to we are expecting to make
this behavior the mandatory behavior

00:12:58.420 --> 00:12:58.430
this behavior the mandatory behavior
 

00:12:58.430 --> 00:13:01.690
this behavior the mandatory behavior
across all apps and devices that run on

00:13:01.690 --> 00:13:01.700
across all apps and devices that run on
 

00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:06.850
across all apps and devices that run on
the next version of Android so let's say

00:13:06.850 --> 00:13:06.860
the next version of Android so let's say
 

00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:08.530
the next version of Android so let's say
you have an app and want to take

00:13:08.530 --> 00:13:08.540
you have an app and want to take
 

00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:10.390
you have an app and want to take
advantage of this simplified life cycle

00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:10.400
advantage of this simplified life cycle
 

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:14.260
advantage of this simplified life cycle
how do you opt in well again it's pretty

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:14.270
how do you opt in well again it's pretty
 

00:13:14.270 --> 00:13:17.620
how do you opt in well again it's pretty
simple you add this one flag to your

00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:17.630
simple you add this one flag to your
 

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:20.980
simple you add this one flag to your
Android manifest there's one caveat

00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:20.990
Android manifest there's one caveat
 

00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:22.960
Android manifest there's one caveat
though because there are now multiple

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:22.970
though because there are now multiple
 

00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:24.850
though because there are now multiple
activities that could be resumed at the

00:13:24.850 --> 00:13:24.860
activities that could be resumed at the
 

00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:26.890
activities that could be resumed at the
same time it could also be that it's

00:13:26.890 --> 00:13:26.900
same time it could also be that it's
 

00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:28.780
same time it could also be that it's
more than one activity from your apps

00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:28.790
more than one activity from your apps
 

00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:31.420
more than one activity from your apps
process and so be really cautious around

00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:31.430
process and so be really cautious around
 

00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:35.770
process and so be really cautious around
code that stores the one recent activity

00:13:35.770 --> 00:13:35.780
code that stores the one recent activity
 

00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:37.150
code that stores the one recent activity
because they might now be more than one

00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:37.160
because they might now be more than one
 

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:39.610
because they might now be more than one
of those and also be cautious around

00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:39.620
of those and also be cautious around
 

00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:41.950
of those and also be cautious around
libraries and frameworks that might make

00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:41.960
libraries and frameworks that might make
 

00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:47.590
libraries and frameworks that might make
the same assumptions now with that I'm

00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:47.600
the same assumptions now with that I'm
 

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:49.840
the same assumptions now with that I'm
gonna hand it back over to andrey who's

00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:49.850
gonna hand it back over to andrey who's
 

00:13:49.850 --> 00:13:53.380
gonna hand it back over to andrey who's
gonna talk about multi window multi

00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:53.390
gonna talk about multi window multi
 

00:13:53.390 --> 00:14:00.520
gonna talk about multi window multi
display Thank You Adrian so let's talk a

00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:00.530
display Thank You Adrian so let's talk a
 

00:14:00.530 --> 00:14:04.420
display Thank You Adrian so let's talk a
bit more about multi screen devices so

00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:04.430
bit more about multi screen devices so
 

00:14:04.430 --> 00:14:06.820
bit more about multi screen devices so
as you know starting with Android Oh an

00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:06.830
as you know starting with Android Oh an
 

00:14:06.830 --> 00:14:08.530
as you know starting with Android Oh an
activity can be launched on a non

activity can be launched on a non
 

00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:10.540
activity can be launched on a non
default display let's see what it

00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:10.550
default display let's see what it
 

00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:16.690
default display let's see what it
actually means for your activity first

00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:16.700
actually means for your activity first
 

00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:18.850
actually means for your activity first
of all when an activity is on a non

00:14:18.850 --> 00:14:18.860
of all when an activity is on a non
 

00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:21.250
of all when an activity is on a non
default display it means that the

00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:21.260
default display it means that the
 

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:23.170
default display it means that the
activity context which is a visible

00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:23.180
activity context which is a visible
 

00:14:23.180 --> 00:14:25.330
activity context which is a visible
entity is different from non visual

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:25.340
entity is different from non visual
 

00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:27.910
entity is different from non visual
application context also available from

00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:27.920
application context also available from
 

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:29.410
application context also available from
broadcast receivers and content

00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:29.420
broadcast receivers and content
 

00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:32.020
broadcast receivers and content
providers the context of a visible

00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:32.030
providers the context of a visible
 

00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:34.270
