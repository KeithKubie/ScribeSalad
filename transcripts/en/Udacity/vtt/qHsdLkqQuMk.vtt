00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Well, let's think acceleration is zero which means force is up, must be balanced by forces down.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
What are the forces up, well these two combined.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Our force down is just mg and we're looking for Fns and check it out.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
The normal force provided by the scale which is how hard the scale is pushing up on you,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
is equal to the weight mg minus the normal force from the ground,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and that's how hard the ground is pushing up.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Since, I'm subtracting something from mg, this gets smaller.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Now it turns out in this first situation, the scale would have accurately measured your weight.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
If you weigh 70 kg, the scale would have read 70 kg because FN was equal to mg.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
In this case, the scale would have read less than 70 kg.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
So, what the scale is actually measuring is not your weight.

00:00:41.000 --> 99:59:59.000
They're measuring how hard they have to push up, so that you don't fall through. Pretty cool.
