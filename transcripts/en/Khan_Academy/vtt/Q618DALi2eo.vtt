00:00:00.106 --> 00:00:03.130
- [Voiceover] In the introductory video

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:04.819
to the Hardy-Weinberg equation,

00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:07.328
I gave some conditions for
the Hardy-Weinberg equation

00:00:07.328 --> 00:00:09.530
to hold, and what I
wanna do in this video is

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:10.970
go into a little bit more depth,

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:12.620
and have a little bit more of a discussion

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.185
on the conditions for the
Hardy-Weinberg equation.

00:00:15.185 --> 00:00:16.821
Now just to review what the Hardy-Weinberg

00:00:16.821 --> 00:00:18.171
equation is all about,

00:00:18.171 --> 00:00:20.169
if we have a population with the gene,

00:00:20.169 --> 00:00:22.146
say for eye color, and let's say that gene

00:00:22.146 --> 00:00:24.955
comes in two versions, one
is the allele that produces

00:00:24.955 --> 00:00:27.902
blue, one is the allele
that produces brown,

00:00:27.902 --> 00:00:30.084
if p is the frequency of the blue allele,

00:00:30.084 --> 00:00:31.944
q is the frequency of the brown allele.

00:00:31.944 --> 00:00:33.907
Well, and if they're
the only two versions,

00:00:33.907 --> 00:00:36.526
if you add the frequency
of p, of the blue,

00:00:36.526 --> 00:00:38.381
plus the frequency of the brown,

00:00:38.381 --> 00:00:39.659
they're gonna add up to 100%, or one.

00:00:39.659 --> 00:00:41.692
And if you square both sides of this,

00:00:41.692 --> 00:00:44.344
you would get this
expression right over here.

00:00:44.344 --> 00:00:47.640
And we talk about that
this is the probability,

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.190
or you could say, the frequency,

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.107
of being a homozygous for the blue.

00:00:54.353 --> 00:00:58.520
This is the probability of
having two alleles for the brown.

00:01:00.025 --> 00:01:01.714
And then right here in the middle,

00:01:01.714 --> 00:01:04.378
this is the probability
of being a heterozygote,

00:01:04.378 --> 00:01:05.862
and why is that?

00:01:05.862 --> 00:01:07.511
Well cause you can get
a blue from your mom

00:01:07.511 --> 00:01:09.187
and a brown from your dad,

00:01:09.187 --> 00:01:11.576
or a blue from your dad
and a brown from your mom.

00:01:11.576 --> 00:01:15.475
So there's two ways to
get that pq combination.

00:01:15.475 --> 00:01:19.284
Now the key idea is Hardy-Weinberg assumes

00:01:19.284 --> 00:01:21.451
a stable allele frequency,

00:01:22.402 --> 00:01:24.745
so let me write that really big.

00:01:24.745 --> 00:01:26.112
Because all of these other
conditions that you might see

00:01:26.112 --> 00:01:28.572
are really like, well, what
are all the different ways

00:01:28.572 --> 00:01:31.987
that you could somehow not
have stable allele frequency?

00:01:31.987 --> 00:01:35.332
So let me write this down,
the stable allele frequency.

00:01:35.332 --> 00:01:37.332
Stable allele frequency.

00:01:42.705 --> 00:01:44.291
So a lot of times there's
a temptation to memorize

00:01:44.291 --> 00:01:46.985
a bunch of this stuff,
you might wanna do that.

00:01:46.985 --> 00:01:49.147
But the more important thing
is to get the underlying idea.

00:01:49.147 --> 00:01:52.053
And the underlying idea is,
well, will something somehow

00:01:52.053 --> 00:01:54.682
cause the allele frequency to be unstable?

00:01:54.682 --> 00:01:56.857
And actually, another way to
say stable allele frequency

00:01:56.857 --> 00:01:58.854
is no evolution.

00:01:58.854 --> 00:01:59.937
No evolution.

00:02:01.474 --> 00:02:04.147
Evolution is a change in
the inheritable traits

00:02:04.147 --> 00:02:06.334
in a population, and that
will include a change

00:02:06.334 --> 00:02:08.328
in allele frequency.

00:02:08.328 --> 00:02:10.553
And if you think about the
two ways that you could have

00:02:10.553 --> 00:02:14.720
a population evolving, well,
you can have selection.

00:02:15.641 --> 00:02:17.983
So we're gonna assume no selection.

00:02:17.983 --> 00:02:20.150
Actually, there's more than two ways,

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.444
you could have genetic engineering
and all sorts of things.

00:02:22.444 --> 00:02:25.879
So we're gonna assume the mainstream ways,

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:27.953
I guess you could say, we
can assume no selection,

00:02:27.953 --> 00:02:30.536
we can assume no genetic drift.

00:02:31.823 --> 00:02:35.242
Remember, selection is
certain traits that make

00:02:35.242 --> 00:02:39.231
that organism more fit
for that environment,

00:02:39.231 --> 00:02:42.539
well those traits are more
likely to be passed on.

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:44.346
Genetic drift is random chance changes

00:02:44.346 --> 00:02:46.346
in the allele frequency.

00:02:47.454 --> 00:02:48.888
It could be due to small populations,

00:02:48.888 --> 00:02:51.266
it could be due to
members of the population

00:02:51.266 --> 00:02:54.276
migrating or some type
of bottleneck effect,

00:02:54.276 --> 00:02:55.985
some natural disaster that really gets you

00:02:55.985 --> 00:02:57.645
to that small population.

00:02:57.645 --> 00:02:59.554
So that's the big picture.

00:02:59.554 --> 00:03:01.243
But given that big picture,

00:03:01.243 --> 00:03:03.245
I wanna dive deep into
some of the assumptions

00:03:03.245 --> 00:03:05.983
that you might see in your biology class,

00:03:05.983 --> 00:03:07.327
just so you feel comfortable with them

00:03:07.327 --> 00:03:09.278
and you see that we're
talking about the same thing.

00:03:09.278 --> 00:03:11.268
So the ones that I mentioned in that

00:03:11.268 --> 00:03:13.015
introductory video are no selection,

00:03:13.015 --> 00:03:15.971
and that's consistent with no evolution.

00:03:15.971 --> 00:03:18.753
I also talk about no net mutation,

00:03:18.753 --> 00:03:21.932
also consistent with no evolution.

00:03:21.932 --> 00:03:23.564
Once again, we don't want to
change the allele frequency.

00:03:23.564 --> 00:03:25.883
If there was net mutation, one of those,

00:03:25.883 --> 00:03:28.254
maybe some of those blue
versions of the gene

00:03:28.254 --> 00:03:30.313
got a mutation and they're
now maybe a different version,

00:03:30.313 --> 00:03:32.775
or they're definitely not blue anymore,

00:03:32.775 --> 00:03:34.474
so the allele frequency would change.

00:03:34.474 --> 00:03:37.215
The reason why we care
about large population

00:03:37.215 --> 00:03:39.772
is mainly for genetic drift.

00:03:39.772 --> 00:03:41.042
If you have a very small population,

00:03:41.042 --> 00:03:42.694
just due to random chance,

00:03:42.694 --> 00:03:45.461
it's more likely that
the allele frequencies

00:03:45.461 --> 00:03:47.013
can change appreciably.

00:03:47.013 --> 00:03:49.454
The other conditions
that you will often see

00:03:49.454 --> 00:03:52.621
are things like random, random mating.

00:03:53.817 --> 00:03:57.984
That whether an organism has
the blue or the brown version

00:03:59.038 --> 00:04:01.846
of the gene, that that
doesn't make them any more

00:04:01.846 --> 00:04:05.963
or less desirable to a
member of the opposite sex.

00:04:05.963 --> 00:04:07.213
And if you think about, you might say,

00:04:07.213 --> 00:04:09.532
well isn't that a form of selection?

00:04:09.532 --> 00:04:11.267
And you'd say well yes, it kind of is,

00:04:11.267 --> 00:04:14.700
but this is sometimes
broken out as another way.

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.079
Now also, no migration,
that you don't have,

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:20.705
the population isn't
growing by other organisms

00:04:20.705 --> 00:04:22.943
entering it or isn't
shrinking by other organisms

00:04:22.943 --> 00:04:24.533
leaving or there's not
a mixing of population

00:04:24.533 --> 00:04:26.705
between two populations.

00:04:26.705 --> 00:04:29.141
And once again, it's
all in, it's all because

00:04:29.141 --> 00:04:32.380
we care about stable allele frequencies.

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:34.982
Now if we wanna go even further than that,

00:04:34.982 --> 00:04:37.748
and sometimes you will hear
these types of things mentioned,

00:04:37.748 --> 00:04:40.604
although I just mentioned
the five mainstream things,

00:04:40.604 --> 00:04:43.582
which all boil down to
stable allele frequency,

00:04:43.582 --> 00:04:45.806
no evolution, no selection,
no genetic drift.

00:04:45.806 --> 00:04:49.146
But sometimes, we are
assuming that we are dealing

00:04:49.146 --> 00:04:51.663
with diploid organisms,
that you're getting one set

00:04:51.663 --> 00:04:54.395
of chromosomes from your
mom, one set of chromosomes

00:04:54.395 --> 00:04:57.304
from your dad, one version
of an allele from your mom,

00:04:57.304 --> 00:04:59.456
one version of an allele from your dad.

00:04:59.456 --> 00:05:01.969
And you might say well, how
can you be other than diploid?

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:04.662
Well you could be a, there
are tetraploid populations,

00:05:04.662 --> 00:05:06.979
especially this can happen in plants.

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:09.001
Or you could get two sets of
chromosomes from your mom,

00:05:09.001 --> 00:05:12.299
and two sets of chromosomes from your dad.

00:05:12.299 --> 00:05:15.299
We are assuming sexual reproduction.

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.346
That we're not dealing with cloning

00:05:19.346 --> 00:05:22.538
or just budding, where
you're just a copy of

00:05:22.538 --> 00:05:26.210
another organism from
generation to generation.

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:30.782
We're assuming that whether
you are blue or brown,

00:05:30.782 --> 00:05:32.133
whether you have those versions,

00:05:32.133 --> 00:05:34.285
that that's not correlated
with what sex you are.

00:05:34.285 --> 00:05:38.452
So allele frequency, allele
frequency same in all sexes,

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:47.003
in all sexes.

00:05:48.988 --> 00:05:50.963
And we're assuming sexual
reproduction, once again,

00:05:50.963 --> 00:05:52.958
we're assuming one where
there's only two sexes,

00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:55.207
so you could, you know, if
you were to think about,

00:05:55.207 --> 00:05:56.976
if you were to let your
imagination go wild,

00:05:56.976 --> 00:05:59.596
you could imagine a lot of
other constraints to put here

00:05:59.596 --> 00:06:03.011
or other ways that the,
where you could no longer

00:06:03.011 --> 00:06:05.094
apply the Hardy-Weinberg.

00:06:06.506 --> 00:06:08.001
Where this is with two alleles,

00:06:08.001 --> 00:06:09.528
we're assuming sexual reproduction,

00:06:09.528 --> 00:06:10.933
diploid, you're getting from
your mom, from your dad,

00:06:10.933 --> 00:06:12.857
and just here are all the conditions

00:06:12.857 --> 00:06:16.738
that help us ensure that we
have a stable allele frequency.

00:06:16.738 --> 00:06:18.434
Now the one thing you're saying, okay,

00:06:18.434 --> 00:06:20.913
I can, diploid, sexual reproduction, okay.

00:06:20.913 --> 00:06:25.067
But isn't there always a
chance for a little bit

00:06:25.067 --> 00:06:26.391
of genetic drift?

00:06:26.391 --> 00:06:29.246
Isn't there just, the
history of the world,

00:06:29.246 --> 00:06:31.011
is that we have this evolution,

00:06:31.011 --> 00:06:32.406
and the answer is yes.

00:06:32.406 --> 00:06:34.633
And so the actual reality
is that there's very few

00:06:34.633 --> 00:06:36.867
places where you can point to,

00:06:36.867 --> 00:06:38.864
very few populations, if any,

00:06:38.864 --> 00:06:40.694
where you can say, oh, that's a pure,

00:06:40.694 --> 00:06:43.294
we can purely apply Hardy-Weinberg there.

00:06:43.294 --> 00:06:46.602
But like a lot of things
in the applied sciences,

00:06:46.602 --> 00:06:50.542
it's a very good approximation
for many populations.

00:06:50.542 --> 00:06:52.870
And so that's why it is useful.
