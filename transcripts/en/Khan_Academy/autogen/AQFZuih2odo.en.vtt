00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.579
let's talk about proportionality

00:00:03.579 --> 00:00:03.589
let's talk about proportionality
 

00:00:03.589 --> 00:00:09.709
let's talk about proportionality
proportion portion ality all this means

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719
proportion portion ality all this means
 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.070
proportion portion ality all this means
if we say that two variables are

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:12.080
if we say that two variables are
 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.930
if we say that two variables are
proportional it just means that they are

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940
proportional it just means that they are
 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.480
proportional it just means that they are
constant multiples of each other so this

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490
constant multiples of each other so this
 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.470
constant multiples of each other so this
is so if we say that Y is equal to three

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480
is so if we say that Y is equal to three
 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.000
is so if we say that Y is equal to three
times X we can say that Y is and we can

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010
times X we can say that Y is and we can
 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.380
times X we can say that Y is and we can
be a little bit more specific we could

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390
be a little bit more specific we could
 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.689
be a little bit more specific we could
say Y is directly proportional Y is

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699
say Y is directly proportional Y is
 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:35.330
say Y is directly proportional Y is
directly directly proportional

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340
directly directly proportional
 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:42.260
directly directly proportional
proportional to X - X and of course we

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270
proportional to X - X and of course we
 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.970
proportional to X - X and of course we
could divide both sides of this equation

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980
could divide both sides of this equation
 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.630
could divide both sides of this equation
and we would by three and we would get

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:46.640
and we would by three and we would get
 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.170
and we would by three and we would get
one-third Y is equal to X so once again

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180
one-third Y is equal to X so once again
 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.330
one-third Y is equal to X so once again
X is a constant multiple of Y we could

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340
X is a constant multiple of Y we could
 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.090
X is a constant multiple of Y we could
write this as X is equal to one-third Y

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100
write this as X is equal to one-third Y
 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.130
write this as X is equal to one-third Y
so we could also write that X is

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140
so we could also write that X is
 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:05.030
so we could also write that X is
directly directly proportional

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040
directly directly proportional
 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.969
directly directly proportional
proportional to Y if Y is directly

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979
proportional to Y if Y is directly
 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.980
proportional to Y if Y is directly
proportional to X then X is also

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990
proportional to X then X is also
 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.899
proportional to X then X is also
directly proportional to Y by a

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909
directly proportional to Y by a
 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.740
directly proportional to Y by a
different proportionality constant so

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750
different proportionality constant so
 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.600
different proportionality constant so
this term right here this is the

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610
this term right here this is the
 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.640
this term right here this is the
constant of proportionality between y

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650
constant of proportionality between y
 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.530
constant of proportionality between y
and X or between x and y this is the

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540
and X or between x and y this is the
 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.350
and X or between x and y this is the
constant of proportionality so in

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360
constant of proportionality so in
 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.780
constant of proportionality so in

directly proportional directly sometimes
 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.010
directly proportional directly sometimes

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.539
that constant or that constant it's
equal to some number and you could also

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549
equal to some number and you could also
 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.550

say that B is directly proportional to a
 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.770
say that B is directly proportional to a
where you know if you divide both sides

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780
where you know if you divide both sides
 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.139
where you know if you divide both sides

problem it says that X is proportional
 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:57.440
problem it says that X is proportional
to Y so we that means that X is equal to

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450
to Y so we that means that X is equal to
 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:01.220

00:09:11.069 --> 00:09:11.079
flowing in a wire is inversely
 

00:09:11.079 --> 00:09:13.440
flowing in a wire is inversely
proportional to resistance of the wire

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:13.450
proportional to resistance of the wire
 

00:09:13.450 --> 00:09:16.650
proportional to resistance of the wire
so current flowing in a wire is

00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:16.660
so current flowing in a wire is
 

00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:19.110
so current flowing in a wire is
inversely proportional to resistance of

00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:19.120
inversely proportional to resistance of
 

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:24.420
inversely proportional to resistance of
a wire so let's use I for current I is

00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:24.430
a wire so let's use I for current I is
 

00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:27.889
a wire so let's use I for current I is
equal to current and we'll use R for

00:09:27.889 --> 00:09:27.899

00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:35.130
resistance R is equal to resistance and

00:13:45.970 --> 00:13:47.999
intensity of light is inversely
proportional to the square of the

00:13:47.999 --> 00:13:48.009
proportional to the square of the
 

00:13:48.009 --> 00:13:50.639
proportional to the square of the
distance not just to the distance so to

00:13:50.639 --> 00:13:50.649
distance not just to the distance so to
 

00:13:50.649 --> 00:13:52.559
distance not just to the distance so to
the square of the distance so two

00:13:52.559 --> 00:13:52.569
the square of the distance so two
 

00:13:52.569 --> 00:13:56.189
the square of the distance so two
distance squared if it just said 2 the

00:13:56.189 --> 00:13:56.199
distance squared if it just said 2 the
 

00:13:56.199 --> 00:13:58.319
distance squared if it just said 2 the
distance we would just have a D here but

00:13:58.319 --> 00:13:58.329
distance we would just have a D here but
 

00:13:58.329 --> 00:13:59.490
distance we would just have a D here but
it says the intensity of light is

00:13:59.490 --> 00:13:59.500
it says the intensity of light is
 

00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:02.280
it says the intensity of light is
inversely proportional so 1 over the

00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:02.290
inversely proportional so 1 over the
 

00:14:02.290 --> 00:14:04.650
inversely proportional so 1 over the
square of the distance between the light

00:14:04.650 --> 00:14:04.660
square of the distance between the light
 

00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:06.780
square of the distance between the light
source and the object being illuminated

00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:06.790
source and the object being illuminated
 

00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:09.720
source and the object being illuminated
so that's what this first step statement

00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:09.730
so that's what this first step statement
 

00:14:09.730 --> 00:14:11.519
so that's what this first step statement
is going to give us this equation right

00:14:11.519 --> 00:14:11.529
is going to give us this equation right

is going to give us this equation right
here now they tell us a light meter that

00:14:16.319 --> 00:14:16.329
here now they tell us a light meter that
 

00:14:16.329 --> 00:14:19.170
here now they tell us a light meter that
is 10 meters so they're saying when

00:14:19.170 --> 00:14:19.180
is 10 meters so they're saying when
 

00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:21.960
is 10 meters so they're saying when
distance is equal to 10 meters a light

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:21.970
distance is equal to 10 meters a light
 

00:14:21.970 --> 00:14:23.970

meter that is 10 meters from a light
 

00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:28.110
meter that is 10 meters from a light
source registers 35 Lux so when the

00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:28.120
source registers 35 Lux so when the
 

00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:30.509
source registers 35 Lux so when the
distance is equal to 10 meters they're

00:14:30.509 --> 00:14:30.519
distance is equal to 10 meters they're
 

00:14:30.519 --> 00:14:32.790
distance is equal to 10 meters they're
telling us that the intensity the Lux is

00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:32.800
telling us that the intensity the Lux is
 

00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:35.189
telling us that the intensity the Lux is
a measure of intensity the intensity is

00:14:35.189 --> 00:14:35.199
a measure of intensity the intensity is
 

00:14:35.199 --> 00:14:40.800
a measure of intensity the intensity is
equal to 35 lux so what is the intense

00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:40.810
equal to 35 lux so what is the intense
 

00:14:40.810 --> 00:14:43.110
equal to 35 lux so what is the intense

00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:43.120
what intensity would register 25 meters
 

00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:44.910
what intensity would register 25 meters
from the light source so this first

00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:44.920
from the light source so this first
 

00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:46.889
from the light source so this first
