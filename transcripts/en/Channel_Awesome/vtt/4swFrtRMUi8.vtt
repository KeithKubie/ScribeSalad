00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:35.000
NC: Hello, I'm the Nostalgia Critic. I remember it so you don't have to.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.400
You know, I was walking down the aisles of a video store when I noticed something I haven't seen in years:

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.800
Cartoon All-Stars to the Rescue.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.500
Immediately, a pool of disappointing memories came flooding back to me,

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.200
and I just knew I had to see this piece of shit again.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.340
Now for those of you who don't remember the special, I'll give you the skinny.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.900
Usually some clips from the special would play here,

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.600
but seeing how my copy died a long time ago, I'm just gonna move on without it.

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.000
Rob: Uh, Critic?

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.900
NC: Yeah?

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:07.700
Rob: What are you doing?

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.200
NC: Isn't it great? I'm recreating the glory days of my first review!

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.300
Rob: But you're missing one of the most important elements.

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.000
It's only half a review without it.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.900
NC: No, it's okay.

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.240
I thought about that!

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:22.200
You see, I fill in the void by replacing it with a bunch of other critics!

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.900
Like, Black Critic

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:25.600
Little Kid Critic

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.100
Animated Kitten Critic

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.700
*meow*

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.500
Sexy Female Critic

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:30.700
Invisible Critic

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.500
who might just be a wall.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.000
And, of course, Cameo Critic!

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.100
Cameo Critic: Uh, (shrugs) it's a living!

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.100
Rob: Was this a fan request or something?

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.800
NC: No, that's the great thing about it!

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.900
Nobody wanted to see it, and now it's here for everybody to witness!

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.400
Rob: Critic, how can anyone enjoy a recreation that only has half of what made it good,

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.400
forceful comedic sidekicks,

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.400
practically nothing new to offer,

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.100
and wasn't something that the fanbase ever demanded in the first place

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.300
to begin with?
NC: I think they get the idea.

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:03.800
Rob: Alright.
NC: "Blues Brothers 2000."

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.200
NC: Based on the classic SNL Chicago musical about two blues musicians trying to save an orphanage

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.100
and somehow end up becoming the most wanted men in America,

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.200
the sequel, shot 18 years later, is kind of like that,

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.400
minus the enjoyment.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.600
It's a desperate retread between writer/actor Dan Akyroyd and writer/director John Landis

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.100
to relive the glory days by somehow bringing us none of the glory.

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.800
As such, it's said to be one of the most pointless,

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:34.500
underwhelming,

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.000
and just downright bizarre sequels in comedy history.

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.500
(Laughing) And trust me, that's saying a great deal.

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.400
So, let's see what's wrong with the past by

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.600
...getting out of the past.

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.100
This is "Blues Brothers 2000."

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.600
Taj Mahal (singing): Tell me, who's that writin'? / John The Revelator...

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.800
NC: At first, the opening number seems legitimately subtle, and even kind of atmospheric.

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.500
But this movie is like Huntington's disease. It works very slowly.

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:01.600
Officer: Good morning, warden.

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:02.200
Warden: Tom.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.700
NC: Frank Oz plays one of the many returning cast members who just looks old and sad now,

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.500
as he tells Elwood about his brother Jake's departure.

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.900
NC: (as the Warden) You got no plot; you got no comedy; you don't even have the other Blues Brother.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.400
Unless you have an entertaining sock puppet under your hat, count me the fuck out of this.

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.580
(normal voice) So after finding out about his...

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.000
(confused): drug overdose in prison?

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.700
A friend of a friend pops by to pick him up a mere 24 hours later.

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.200
Hey, better late than never.

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.700
Or, as you'll constantly say in this movie,

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:35.800
better never than ever.

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.200
Elwood: Matara, can you drop me off here, please?

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:40.700
NC: So he drops by the nun from the previous installment

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.100
to tell you who else died since the first film you saw.

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.400
Mother Mary Stigmata: Curtis has gone on as well, Elwood. I'm sorry.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.220
Elwood: The orphanage is gone; Jake's gone; Curtis is gone.

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.200
I got no brother; I got no roots; I got no life. I got nothin', for Christ sake.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.800
NC: And yet, you're still making a movie.

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:55.900
See the problem here?

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.800
NC: By the way, isn't it good to know that the orphanage is gone, too?

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:03.820
That everything the first film was working for was completely in vain?

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.760
Elwood: He was very upset when the orphanage closed.

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:11.060
NC: Maybe that whole intro where God was giving light to Jake was actually supposed to be saying...

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.460
Reverend Cleophus James: Have you seen the light?

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.500
Jake: YES! YES! JESUS!

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.060
NC (as God): Whoops! No. No. I was actually aiming for the person in the front row.

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:21.400
Yes, that person.

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.620
I demand you to put Nicolas Cage in a Left Behind movie!

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:29.900
There. Thy will and totally confusing ways are done.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.900
You two, ha, you just get a shitty sequel.

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:33.800
Goodbye!

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:35.800
Jake: Bullshit.

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:40.000
NC: But it's okay, because they bring in the obvious target audience this movie was meant for.

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.200
Mother Mary Stigmata: And Buster here is a ward of the state.

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:46.240
The archdiocese has agreed to house homeless children here.

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.300
I thought perhaps that you would come and spend time with Buster.

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.400
NC: Yes, because nothing makes more sense than teaming up an innocent youth

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.600
with a convicted felon who literally just got done serving 20 years in jail.

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:58.700
Jake: Bullshit.

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:04.300
NC: Something else you'll notice is that while Akyroyd's Chicago accent in the original was playfully exaggerated,

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.200
this accent sounds like it's coming from a fucking Muppet.

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:08.000
Elwood: Chicago.

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:09.300
I think you need a hug.

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:10.200
Who wants to know?

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:11.000
What boat?

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.000
She's bone dry.

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:13.600
A part of this band's repertoire.

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.800
What's that got to do with me?

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:17.400
NC: (imitating Chicago accent) 'Ey, hot dogs,

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:18.200
the Bears,

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:21.000
pizza that had to make Jon Stewart accept defeat!

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:23.400
(normal voice) Oh, yeah, we're still riding that.

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.700
NC (vo): But the kid is not so easy to get rid of.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.500
Elwood: I know what you're going through.

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.100
You're lonely, searching for your place in life.

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:33.000
Just don't blow it like I did.

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:36.700
Besides, you don't want to hang around with some over-40 recidivist.

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.500
NC: You know, I wonder if I'm even needed for this review.

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:41.200
The movie does quite well pointing out all the problems itself!

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.600
He discovers that Curtis had a son,

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:44.600
played by Joe Morton,

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:47.200
who apparently has no idea that Curtis was his father.

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:51.800
Elwood talks about reuniting the band, but his kinda brother doesn't take it very well.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
Cabel Chamberlain: And don't ever come back here again!

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:58.100
NC: (as Cabel) You got no plot; you got no comedy; you don't even have the other Blues Brother.

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:01.600
Unless you have a role for me in "Terminator 12," count me the fuck out of this!

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:07.000
(normal voice) But the kid steals the Commander's wallet, giving them just enough money to buy a new BluesMobile.

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:10.700
Now, I want you to remember this moment where he steals the wallet.

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:13.940
I'm not gonna explain why yet, but just keep in the back of your brain.

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:17.100
Elwood goes to the club his old band member owns, where...

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:18.900
UHP! Look at that!

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:22.600
CLEARLY we see a new addition to the Blues Brothers!

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:24.500
Oh, not because he's played by John Goodman,

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:26.200
not because he can sing the blues,

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.440
not because they've made countless appearances together years before,

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:32.300
but because of the astounding chemistry

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:37.100
and unforgettable character traits that this movie gives him that-

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:38.300
dare I say it-

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:40.800
even rival that of Belushi.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.560
Watch this.

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:45.300
Elwood: Hi.

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:46.600
NC: And there you go.

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:49.100
That's all the character you need, folks!

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:50.000
Don't believe me?

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.900
Well, they top it with even more incredible character traits.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:53.900
Like, there's this...

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:55.740
Mighty Mack: Hey, Elwood, you got the keys to the trunk?

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:57.840
NC: The unbelievable this...

00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:59.000
Mighty Mack: Pleased to meet you.

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:02.100
NC: And, of course, who can forget the classic line...

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:03.300
Mighty Mack: So what's the plan?

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:07.160
NC: God- *slaps desk* That is SO whatever his character's name is!

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:12.400
It doesn't matter if they barely look each other in the face or hardly ever have a conversation;

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:14.060
the magic is there!

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:18.380
Gah, they have more chemistry than HAL 9000 and Stephen Hawking!

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.340
Stephen Hawking: Hey, HAL, pick two.

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:21.960
HAL 9000: One, two.

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:26.800
Stephen Hawking: You will now have to imagine I am poking you in the eyes causing a humorous effect.

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:29.660
HAL 9000: Nyuk, nyuk.

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:34.140
NC: But it turns out the club is being shut down by Illinois Russians.

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:36.800
Yeah, that's right: Illinois Russians.

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:40.700
God, that doesn't have NEARLY the same flare as Illinois Nazis!

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:42.800
*singing in Russian*

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:54.100
NC: Jesus Christ, you're making Soda Popinski look like an equal rights leader!

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:57.880
So they knock the Russians out and leave them in an alleyway...

00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:01.900
SOMEHOW thinking this won't lead to any more trouble!

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.940
But, lo and behold, the Russians come back for vengeance.

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:07.800
Elwood &amp; Mighty Mack: Gas!

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:11.000
NC: They break out of the club while the Russians burn it down,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.300
only to find the Russians were waiting to chase 'em.

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:17.200
Elwood: Roll down the window and drop the nails.

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:23.100
NC: Wow. Apparently those nails are so powerful, they launched them

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:26.400
SEVERAL FEET BEHIND where they originally started!

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:29.420
Seriously, how the hell did they get back in front of the club again?

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:31.540
Was there a special company that made those nails?

00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:32.400
Oh.

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:38.300
So Akyroyd and Goodman set out to pick up the rest of their band members when-

00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:38.800
NOPE!

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:40.360
NOPE, nope, nope, nope, nope-

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:41.000
you killed the movie.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.100
You killed the movie.

00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:45.500
Whatever little speck of chance you had to make this entertaining,

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:49.100
it was assassinated the minute you put that kid in a suit!

00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:51.000
This is like giving Wolverine a puppy,

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:52.600
or Jules Winfield a martian,

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:53.700
or the Terminator-

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:55.000
Oh, yeah...

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:56.200
that happened.

00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:58.360
Elwood: These are unsophisticated men.

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:01.600
The only things they respond to are fear and the draw of lucre.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000
We elicit this by using iconographic symbols and psychological intimidation.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:06.500
NC: OK,

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:10.900
I'm really amazed you're saying all this stuff about intimidation while including the

00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:13.000
10-year-old kid in your argument.

00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:16.100
Elwood: The only things they respond to are fear and the draw of lucre.

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:17.300
NC: With a 10-year-old kid.

00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:20.100
Elwood: Iconographic symbols and psychological intimidation.

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:21.200
NC: With a 10-year-old kid.

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:23.700
Elwood: Presents a uniform image of strength and organization.

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:24.900
NC: With a 10-year-old kid.

00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:26.600
Elwood: Don't say anything, look mean...

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:27.500
NC: With a 10-year-old kid-

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:31.100
Do you not see what a castration this is to your film?

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:35.000
Elwood: Boys, I'd like you to meet my new partner in the act: Mighty Mack.

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:37.200
NC (as Elwood): We've just been calling him Jake Number Two.

00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:38.800
Elwood: I'm getting the band back together.

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:40.900
Matt "Guitar" Murphy: Man, you can't talk about this stuff here.

00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:42.600
"Blue Lou" Marini: Matt, she's back from lunch.

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:46.100
NC: But sure enough, they're working again for an Aretha Franklin cameo,

00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:47.300
and once again,

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:51.600
they have to argue their way out of it while she blindly goes into a song.

00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:54.200
Mrs. Murphy: You treat me with respect at all times.

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:55.500
Matt "Guitar" Murphy: I do, baby.

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:58.760
Mrs. Murphy: And you know what I mean when I say "respect."

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:02.000
NC: You know,

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.700
where the first movie was kind of funny in how out of nowhere and unexpected the transition was,

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:12.620
in this one, you obviously know what's coming; you even know what song it's going to be,

00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:15.800
and yet, the transition is STILL sloppy as fucking shit!

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:19.600
It's almost like somebody hit the screen, accidentally changing the channel!

00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:21.220
NC: *yawn*

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:22.000
(stunned) Oh, sorry.

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:23.900
Mrs. Murphy: And you know what I mean...

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.100
NC: There's no surprise to it anymore.

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:29.200
We know they're just gonna join the band like last time,

00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:35.220
so all we have is a slower, less energized version of the scene we saw in the first flick.

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:38.900
This is like watching Grandma say she can still strut her stuff

00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:44.300
and you shutting your eyes as she disturbingly tries to swing her hips in a sexy fashion.

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:47.000
Just serve the potatoes already, Grandma!

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:51.200
Mrs. Murphy: Matt, this is something that I really don't want you to do.

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:55.280
Ah, for crying out loud-

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:58.000
if this is what you're gonna be like to live with, go ahead!

00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:02.300
NC: (as Mrs. Murphy) I mean, Jesus! You got no plot; you got no comedy; you don't even have the other Blues Brother!

00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:06.600
Unless you have a well-paying Pepsi commercial to offer me, count me the fuck out of this!

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.900
They get back the other members of the band who, again, demonstrate some killer acting chops.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.100
Tom "Bones" Malone: Hey, fellas, I think I know that voice.

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:16.700
Donald "Duck" Dunn: Steve, you know I think that sounded a lot like...

00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:18.000
Tom "Bones" Malone: Elwood J. Blues.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.200
Donald "Duck" Dunn: No place to run...

00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:21.000
Steve "The Colonel" Cropper: And no place to hide.

00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:23.500
NC: Oh, I'm sorry, was that paint drying?

00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:26.000
I confused the two on levels of engagement.

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:30.040
And they finally have to get their last member back from his old job.

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:31.900
Elwood: We need Murph on the keyboards.

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:33.000
Ed: I see.

00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:35.100
Murphy "Murph" Dunne: I told them I wouldn't go without your say-so.

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:38.100
Elwood: Just what is it that you do exactly?

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:39.900
NC: (as Elwood) And if you could sing about it,

00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:42.500
even though we just had a goddamn musical number a minute ago,

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:43.600
that'd be most helpful.

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:47.600
Ed (singing): If you need a little lovin'...

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:48.200
NC: *sighs*

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:53.400
Why do these musical numbers annoy me so much more in this film than they did in the last one?

00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:54.800
They're not bad;

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.800
they're good renditions done by talented people.

00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:00.300
Even Macaulay Culkin (It's actually Jonny Lang) seems to get a solo,

00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:03.900
but there's just no damn spacing between them.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.200
They just go from one song that has nothing to do with anything

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:09.900
to another song that has nothing to do with anything.

00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:12.900
The music in the original didn't have much connection to the story either,

00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:19.200
but at least there was a homicidal fiance, car chases, funny cops, fucking Illinois Nazis-

00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:21.500
that's enough to fill in the gaps!

00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:23.700
What do we have to fill in the gaps in this one?

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:26.100
Murphy "Murph" Dunne: I haven't played a county fair since '68.

00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:28.500
Alan "Mr. Fabulous" Rubin: Sounds like a lot of laughs.

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:38.700
John Popper: Didn't you used to be Elwood Blues?

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:40.000
Elwood: Yeah, so?

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.400
John Popper: We're rehearsing just on the other side of that motel office.

00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:44.900
It would be so cool if you could come listen to us play.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.000
Elwood: Oh, sure, sure-

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.100
NC: Fuck me with tuna-

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:49.200
we just got DONE WITH A SONG!

00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:52.300
Are we really gonna do three in a row?!

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:56.100
Even waterboarders give their victims a break every once in a while!

00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:59.000
Elwood: LET'S HIGHBALL!

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:00.800
NC: Oh, look at that!

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:06.100
Our characters SO don't care how the song works into the movie that they don't even stick around to hear 'em!

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:10.800
The movie itself is that not interested in its own musical numbers.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.900
*HA* Why don't we just have the rest of the movie be a runaway letter from Dan Akyroyd saying:

00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:17.800
NC (as Elwood): *reading the letter*

00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:28.320
(normal voice) On top of that,

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:31.700
the musical numbers were in-between a spiritual quest:

00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:35.600
a very bizarre redemption involving putting the band back together to

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:39.600
earnestly and honestly raise money to protect their childhood home.

00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:45.500
That's one of the reasons there's so much urgency for the bandmembers to leave their dead-end crappy jobs and do what's right.

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:48.200
In this one, have you noticed something missing?

00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:50.500
Something kind of a big deal?

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:53.800
There is no reason to put the band back together!

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:55.400
None! At all!

00:13:55.400 --> 00:14:01.300
They all have good jobs that pay well and even rekindled old romances that seem to be working out pretty well.

00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:04.600
Why the fuck would any of them leave this behind?

00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:08.900
There is nothing to fight for, nothing to chase, nothing to gain redemption!

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:15.000
They're stressing the importance of putting the band back together even though they forgot to mention what was fucking important about it!

00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:16.700
In the first film, the phrase was...

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:18.200
Elwood: We're on a mission from God.

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:19.500
Elwood: We're on a mission from God.

00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:20.800
Elwood: We're on a mission from God.

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:22.780
NC: Now, in this one, the phrase is...

00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:25.200
Elwood: The Lord works in mysterious ways.

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:27.900
The Lord works in mysterious ways.

00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:30.500
The Lord works in mysterious ways.

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:36.700
NC: Yeah, so mysterious that you took 18 years to work on a sequel that somehow you forgot to give a reason for even fucking existing!

00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:41.600
IT'S KIND OF IMPORTANT FOR A FILM TO HAVE A REASON TO FUCKING EXIST,

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:47.300
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT'S A SEQUEL TO SOMETHING AS GODDAMN AWESOME AS "THE BLUES BROTHERS"!

00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:48.600
Fuck it, I need a break!

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:54.700
Here's the only thing certain after death, taxes, and everything you love either getting a shitty sequel or a shitty remake:

00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:55.600
Commercials!

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:13.000
Advertiser: (voiced by Doug) Tired of a movie giving you an unbelievable experience,

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:19.700
only to find years later, the same filmmakers fuck it up with their shitty sequel or spin-off?

00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:24.800
Well, fear no more, because we've invented Fuckital.

00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:32.500
Now you can stop caring about a movie series you once loved by acknowledging it probably wasn't that important to begin with.

00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:35.700
Malcolm: Can you believe the person who directed Alien did this?

00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:37.000
Tamara: Sure...

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.200
Malcolm: It makes no sense and pales in comparison to the original.

00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:41.300
Tamara: Whatever...

00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:46.000
Malcolm: Hey, if I didn't know any better, I'd say you didn't think this was a big deal.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.400
Tamara: I don't. It's only a movie...

00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:49.000
Malcolm: What?!

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:53.900
Tamara: I used to be emotionally invested in what I watched, but now, the more I think about it,

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.600
maybe Joseph Gordon-Levitt should play Robin.

00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:57.300
Malcolm: No!

00:15:57.300 --> 00:16:00.000
Tamara: Maybe The Hobbit did need all those extra scenes.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.100
Malcolm: You're insane!

00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:02.900
Tamara: Maybe Midi-chlorians...

00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:05.000
aren't such a bad idea.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.500
Malcolm: (crying) Wake up, damn it!

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:08.600
Don't go where I can't follow!

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.560
Advertiser: With a heavy enough dose,

00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:13.800
you'll forget all about Sofia Coppola from Godfather,

00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:15.600
Emo Peter in Spider-Man,

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:19.500
and all pretentious dialogue from the Matrix movies.

00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:20.700
Malcolm: Keep it together! Keep it together!

00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:21.200
Fuckital

00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:24.200
Because it doesn't matter if one of The Blues Brothers is a little kid...

00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:26.000
Or John Goodman...

00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:27.700
Or plotless...

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:29.800
NC: (Breaking character) Or has a car that can do anything,

00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:30.400
because you know,

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:31.100
who cares?

00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:34.100
Who cares at all that it's a timeless classic, the original?

00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:35.900
Yeah, who cares, so we just wanna fuck it up!

00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:37.600
I mean, we just wanna totally destroy it,

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:39.200
because you know, it's just The Blues Brothers!

00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:41.100
Doesn't matter that it's a Chicago icon!

00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:41.800
It doesn't matter!

00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:43.100
IT DOESN'T MATTER AT ALL!

00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:45.000
Malcolm: Um, excuse me, can we call 911 or something? 'Cause-

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.400
NC: No, no, no, I wanna get this off my back!

00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:47.400
I wanna get this off my back!

00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:51.000
The Blues Brothers is just this big symbol of Chicago,

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.300
and it's funny, and it's creative, and it's musical,

00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:54.300
and it's fantastic,

00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:56.900
and when they try to just half-ass it like this, I j-

00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:58.200
Come with me! Let me show you something!

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:01.400
NC: This is Hollywood Boulevard Theater.

00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:03.500
It's a good place, you can get alcohol while watching your movies,

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:05.400
which you'll definitely need for this film,

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:07.200
but do you notice what's on top of there?

00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:08.200
The BluesMobile,

00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:09.600
and not just the BluesMobile

00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:13.000
a statue of one of the Blues Brothers, Dan Aykroyd.

00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:16.600
They put a fucking car on top of the movie theater!

00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:17.500
And you wanna know why?

00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:19.900
Because the movie means that much to them.

00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:21.400
It means that much to Chicago.

00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:22.800
It's an incredible film!

00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:23.700
The music

00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:24.400
the action

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:25.000
the comedy

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:25.500
the writing

00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:27.200
it's so fucking unbelievable!

00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:28.400
And for you

00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:29.600
f-for you-

00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:31.700
After they made a goddamn statue out of you,

00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:32.400
Dan Aykroyd

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:33.800
just make this insult

00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:37.700
this FUCKING insult to this goddamn classic masterpiece-

00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:39.300
I'm sorry, it's despicable!

00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:41.100
It's fucking despicable!

00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:43.520
That's what the Blues Brothers means!

00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:44.700
That's what they're all about

00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:46.200
and for this movie to not even try,

00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:49.700
NOT EVEN FUCKING TRY TO ACKNOWLEDGE WHAT THE HELL THEY ARE, WHAT THE HELL THEY MEANT

00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:51.200
IS JUST BULLSHIT!

00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:54.100
NO, NO, I'M NOT EVEN DOING A TRANSITION!

00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:56.400
I'M JUST GOING BACK TO SAYING WHAT'S FUCKING WRONG WITH IT!

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:02.000
Apparently, something resembling a plot tries to rear its ugly head in the second half

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.700
as Sister Conan O'Brien

00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:04.500
Tom Brokaw

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:06.600
and the secretary from "Ferris Bueller's Day Off"

00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:09.900
inform the Holy Mother that they think Elwood has kidnapped the boy.

00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:11.000
Of course,

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.000
rather than just explain he's not kidnapping him...

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.800
though the more I think about it

00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:17.300
maybe he kinda fucking is

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:21.100
they instead have to stage a getaway out of a diner filled with cops.

00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:25.100
Mighty Mack: HE'S HAVING AN ATTACK!! IT'S EXTREMELY CONTAGIOUS!!

00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:27.000
One of the restaurant patrons: What in Sam Hill...?

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.900
Mighty Mack: RUN AWAY! OH, GOD!

00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:31.000
NC: Ah, *slaps desk* of course!

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:32.200
The old...

00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:36.300
"Look like a minion from Mario 2

00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:39.600
which will cause the police to do nothing for some reason

00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:44.600
allowing you to go into your car and spin around for a solid minute or three

00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:49.200
also causing the police to do nothing for some reason and then take off driving."

00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:53.200
NC: (confused) Ingenious?

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:54.800
But it's okay,

00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:56.800
because they've brought in more people on this case.

00:18:56.800 --> 00:19:00.600
Ones that don't just stare blindly at tricks that wouldn't fool a kindergarten class!

00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:03.600
Cabel Chamberlain: I have every lawman in two states on this border.

00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:06.400
Let him just try and get through this roadblock.

00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:12.000
NC: (imitating Cabel) I do hope my pompous declaration of righteousness is by no means comedically foiled.

00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:15.300
*snortly inhales*

00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:17.900
But hey, it's the Blues Brothers!

00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:22.000
I'm sure they have some awesome driving skills that result in a kick-ass chase scene

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.000
or this bullshit!

00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:34.000
Um...

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:40.900
you sure Elwood isn't in a coma and these are just the dreams he was having in the coma?

00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:43.900
Not that the film isn't tragic enough for how much pain it's causing,

00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:45.900
but at least we would know somebody's suffering for it.

00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:47.700
They come across-

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:50.200
I don't know, Indiana Nazis?

00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:52.300
who, of course, foil their plans of...

00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:54.300
being Indiana Nazis...

00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:58.200
by apparently lifting their boat of explosives out of the water and...

00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:05.200
quite literally watch it just jump up into the air by no discernible rhyme or reason.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.200
Mighty Mack: Did you hear something?

00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:12.000
Elwood: Nope.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:14.500
NC: Funny.

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:16.200
Neither do I.

00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:19.800
So they find a way to sneak into their next gig

00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:22.400
a hidden Elwood tells them to find a place to park, and...

00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:24.600
Elwood, Mighty Mack, and Buster: *screaming*

00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:26.600
NC: (stuttering) WAIT A MINUTE!

00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:30.400
No-no-no, STOP! STOP! STOP!

00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:35.500
I'm sorry! I have to check for my own clarification if they really cared so little!

00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:37.800
Let's go back again.

00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:40.100
They sneak into a gig,

00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:42.100
Elwood tells them to find a place to park,

00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:43.700
and is there anything-

00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:50.800
FUCKING anything that shows how they randomly got in a flaming car spinning on a loop?

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.460
Elwood, Mighty Mack, and Buster: *screaming*

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:54.700
Great! *slaps desk*

00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:57.000
This film has been edited for your viewing confusion!

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.400
Hell, the advertising for the movie should just be

00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:01.200
"Tired of the world making sense?

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:02.700
Blues Brothers 2000!"

00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:03.800
And everybody would say,

00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:06.500
"Yeah, humanity did lose its fucking mind, didn't it?"

00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:10.300
Of course, they start playing their next song to the audience's delight.

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:15.600
Elwood (singing): When all at once, a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw / Plowin' through the ragged sky...

00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:19.700
NC: Oh, good, hopefully God has come to destroy this movie before it gets any worse!

00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:24.200
Malone, Marini, and Rubin (singing): Yippee-yi-oh...

00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:30.100
Elwood (singing): Ghost riders in the skyyyy!

00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:38.900
Elwood (singing): Ghost riders in the skyyyy!

00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:41.000
You know...

00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:42.700
I was gonna ask

00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:45.500
"When did they stop making a Blues Brothers movie?"

00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:47.800
but I don't think that question would be appropriate.

00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:50.200
I think the real question is,

00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:53.900
"When did they ever start making a Blues Brothers movie?"

00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:56.200
What the hell is this?

00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:58.000
It's not "Blues Brothers."

00:21:58.100 --> 00:21:58.800
Maybe it's

00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:00.900
FUCKING Claymation's "Blues Brothers,"

00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:03.100
but it's not the "Blues Brothers" we grew up with.

00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:05.600
This is just...dumb.

00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:08.200
Random and fucking dumb.

00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:10.000
It's like suddenly going...

00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:16.200
Ghost Pony Rider! / Ghost Pony Rider!

00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:20.700
His head is flaming, but his story's tragic / 'Cause he never knew friendship was magic

00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:22.400
Ghost Pony Rider-

00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:23.800
Malcolm: (stops the song) Hey- Critic, Critic, Critic, wait.

00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:25.400
Didn't you do this joke before?

00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:27.900
NC: Look, I don't know the scientific explanation for it

00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:30.800
but for some reason every single time somebody says "pony" on the internet,

00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:32.100
the views go through the roof!

00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:33.400
Malcolm: They do?

00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:34.600
NC: Yeah. Watch.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:35.800
Pony!

00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:38.700
Malcolm: Pony!

00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:43.800
NC and Malcolm: Pony-pony-pony-pony-pony-pony...

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:45.000
NC (vo): So it starts raining,

00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:48.100
which, of course, somehow doesn't affect any of their equipment,

00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:50.800
and Elwood uses his remote control car...

00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:55.900
yeah, *slaps desk* because the BluesMobile was made by fucking Batman, I guess...

00:22:56.300 --> 00:22:57.600
and helps them escape.

00:22:57.800 --> 00:23:00.000
The team, however, has very low morale,

00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:04.300
due to the fact that they have no goddamn idea what the hell they're supposed to be doing in this movie!

00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:07.800
Mighty Mack: Hey, Elwood, I think we got a rebellion on our hands.

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:10.000
Elwood: Why? What do you mean?

00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:17.880
NC: (as the bandmembers) You got no plot, you got no comedy, and you don't even have the other Blues Brother.

00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:21.100
Unless you're willing to split stock on Crystal Head Vodka,

00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:22.800
count us the fuck out of this!

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:24.000
Elwood: Fine.

00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:24.600
Bye.

00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:30.700
NC: Elwood himself starts to feel a little down, but the kid comes in for almost one minute of inspiration.

00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:32.600
Buster: The Elwood Blues I know once said

00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:37.700
that "no pharmaceutical product could ever equal the rush you get when the band hits that groove."

00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:40.300
NC: Again, I'm gonna ask you to remember this scene.

00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:41.700
I'm gonna bring it all together in the end.

00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:48.000
That seems to work, and they happen to come across an old friend in a tent church, played by James Brown.

00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:53.800
*sighs* This whole film is like a mix between a sad high school reunion and an old folks home.

00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:55.600
It's like the worst of both worlds!

00:23:55.780 --> 00:23:57.720
Cabel Chamberlain: Those men are criminals and they're under arrest!

00:23:57.720 --> 00:24:00.000
NC: The commander comes in about to arrest them, but,

00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:04.100
just like before, somebody's about to see the light.

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:08.800
Now, in the original, a light shines on Jake in a comedically over-the-top way.

00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:10.900
Well, if that was over-the-top,

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.740
this is pole-vaulting over the fucking moon!

00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:18.800
Cabel Chamberlain: The calling of the blood...

00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:20.500
Yes!

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.000
THIS IS MY

00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:27.700
DESTINYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!

00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:33.400
NC: You know, I'm just gonna try something here.

00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:37.860
I'm sure you've all played this game before, "Cards Against Humanity", they have an online version.

00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:39.100
If you haven't, you should.

00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:39.600
It's fun.

00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:40.300
Bring the kids.

00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:45.400
I am so convinced that this movie is so batshit insane

00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:49.200
and so doesn't care what the hell they put onscreen,

00:24:49.540 --> 00:24:53.500
that I'm just gonna choose three random cards,

00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:56.200
and see if that randomness-

00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:58.800
that TOTALLY out-there randomness-

00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:03.700
matches up with the rest of the shit that this movie gives us.

00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:05.000
So, let's see...

00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:08.300
"A 130-year old Voodoo Witch,"

00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:09.600
"Zombies,"

00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:12.700
"Rednecks being turned into rats."

00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:16.300
You know, I'm gonna give this movie the benefit of the doubt.

00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:18.700
I don't even believe that this film,

00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:21.100
with all its batshit craziness-

00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:21.900
they did it, didn't they?

00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:24.600
Mighty Mack: She's a 130-year old Voodoo Witch.

00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:30.000
*slaps desk*

00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:39.600
NC: WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!?

00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:40.700
No, seriously,

00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:43.200
WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING?!?

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:44.700
I don't get it!

00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:45.800
I-I really don't!

00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:48.200
None of this adds up in the least!

00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:52.600
It's like you're trying to piss off the people who loved the first film so much!

00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:53.400
Why?

00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:54.300
No, really,

00:25:54.300 --> 00:25:56.500
why are you trying to piss us off?

00:25:56.700 --> 00:25:57.200
Wha-

00:25:57.400 --> 00:25:59.600
are you trying to atone for something?

00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:02.700
Are you trying to tie it back to a mistake you made in the past?

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:03.500
NC: Wha-

00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:09.500
Is there something you fucked up before and you're trying to somehow make things right by making this GODDAMN, STUPID-

00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:11.800
Oh, my God...

00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:13.300
I figured it out!

00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:14.800
I just figured it out!

00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:16.300
The crazy scenarios,

00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:17.300
the magical crap,

00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:19.100
having nothing to do with the original,

00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:22.200
the fact that it doesn't make ANY GODDAMN SENSE WHATSOEVER!

00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:25.000
I GOT IT! I FINALLY GOT IT!

00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:29.400
They were trying to make a live-action version of the video game!

00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:30.400
Think about it!

00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:31.900
Every hit movie needs a game,

00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:34.300
and clearly the game had nothing to do with the original,

00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:39.440
so they were trying to tie them together so that they wouldn't have to make another game!

00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:44.640
My God...

00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:46.500
I see it now!

00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:48.900
Reverend Cleophus James: (from original) Have you seen the light?

00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:49.900
NC: I see it!

00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:51.100
I SEE IT!

00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:53.100
Reverend James: Do you see the light?

00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:54.900
NC: YES! YES!!

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.200
JESUS H. TAP-DANCING CHRIST!!!

00:26:57.300 --> 00:26:58.400
I SEE

00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:00.200
THE LIGHT!!!!

00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:03.600
You guys are FUCKING MORONS!

00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:08.100
Not only does it make for a bad game, but it even makes for a worse film.

00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:11.600
As once they appease the 130-year old Voodoo Witch-

00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:13.000
God! (stuttering)

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:14.000
It's canon!-

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:15.900
and gets themselves into the band,

00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:17.600
along with the Commander, by the way,

00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:20.400
the cops still come to try and take them away.

00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:22.300
Elwood: I guess it's time to say goodbye.

00:27:22.300 --> 00:27:23.800
Cabel "Cab" Chamberlain: They think he kidnapped you!

00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:25.000
Buster: But they're wrong!

00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:27.400
Cab: It would be hard to convince them of that.

00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:29.300
Buster: Well, if I go back with them,

00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:31.700
they'll put me in some foster home

00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:33.300
with people who don't love me,

00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:34.700
and I'll never see you again

00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:36.760
and we'll both be sad forever.

00:27:37.060 --> 00:27:37.560
NC: Okay,

00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:39.300
this is what I was getting to before.

00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:44.400
Remember when I told you to remember that one scene that was only a few seconds long of the kid stealing the wallet?

00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:48.600
And remember when I told you to remember that other scene where the kid motivates Elwood

00:27:48.660 --> 00:27:50.300
and that was only over a minute long?

00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:53.500
Well, those two scenes are actually more important than you think.

00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:56.260
I know you thought they were just pointless little scenes,

00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:59.300
one only being a few seconds long and one only being over a minute-

00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:02.500
I mean, how long's the movie? Two hours? What big a difference can that make?

00:28:02.540 --> 00:28:04.400
But, actually, it makes a huge difference-

00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:05.800
a huge fucking difference-

00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:06.800
and you wanna know why?

00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:09.800
Because those two short little scenes,

00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:11.900
as despicably short as they are,

00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:13.000
are literally...

00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:19.900
LITERALLY the ONLY THINGS the kid has done throughout the entire film!

00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:21.000
Oh, sure-

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:22.300
he dances a bit,

00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:23.400
wears a suit,

00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:24.900
even plays a harmonica...

00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:27.900
but in terms of contributing to anything else?

00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:33.300
I mean, like, anything in the story, any kind of character traits, any kind of personality?

00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:34.400
Nada.

00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:36.200
Not a thing!

00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:40.800
He barely even says a word throughout the entire film, or looks Elwood in the eye.

00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:45.000
A two-hour movie, and he has a minute-and-a-half of worth.

00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:49.000
So, at this big scene where you're supposed to want to see them together,

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:53.600
it literally makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.

00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:57.100
This completely ridiculous visual to the Blues Brothers story

00:28:57.100 --> 00:28:59.500
was ENTIRELY POINTLESS.

00:28:59.860 --> 00:29:02.300
Pretty fucking amazing!

00:29:02.380 --> 00:29:05.500
Buster: The Lord does work in mysterious ways, Elwood.

00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:06.480
Elwood: Yep.

00:29:07.100 --> 00:29:08.400
Jake (from original): Bullshit.

00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:09.780
Elwood: Put on your seatbelt.

00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:13.600
NC: The only thing we can hope is that all that waste of time,

00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:15.200
all that lack of character,

00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:16.700
all those lazy jokes

00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:22.000
AT LEAST have been sacrificed for one hell of an epic climax.

00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:25.500
You're fucking kidding me.

00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:27.100
You're goddamn fucking kidding me!

00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:29.300
That was the end of the movie?!

00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:30.900
THAT WAS THE END OF THE MOVIE?!

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:31.500
THAT WH-?!

00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:36.400
Did you see the first film that you apparently made?

00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:39.900
D-Did you even take a glance at it before you made this piece of-?

00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:43.400
If you don't recall how the first film ended,

00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:45.000
I'll give you a little reminder.

00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:46.300
It had...

00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:48.100
and...

00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:49.300
and...

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:50.500
and...

00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:51.800
and...

00:29:52.460 --> 00:29:52.960
and...

00:29:53.900 --> 00:29:54.400
and...

00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:55.700
and...

00:29:56.600 --> 00:29:57.100
and...

00:29:59.300 --> 00:30:00.500
And, you have...?

00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:01.900
Elwood: Put on your seatbelt.

00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:08.600
NC: *sigh*

00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:12.100
Movie, I'm not angry.

00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:14.320
Yes, I am. I'm furious, but there's something I'm even more, and that's...disappointed. I'm disappointed in you, movie. The same people that brought us a comedy classic, an icon, something they make statues of, has 18 years to put together a follow-up, and this is what we get.

00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:43.500
May God rape you with a pickup truck.

00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:47.100
Slowly.

00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:50.100
With vengeance.

00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:53.100
I'm serious, people.

00:30:53.300 --> 00:30:54.300
It's bad.

00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:58.000
It's really, really, REALLY bad.

00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:01.000
As a standalone movie, it would make no sense.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:04.000
As a sequel, it makes even less sense.

00:31:04.100 --> 00:31:08.600
It is absolutely one of the worst follow-ups to a classic ever.

00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:12.100
And if you're wondering if there's anything of value,

00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:13.600
even the smallest,

00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:14.600
tiniest,

00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:17.200
teenie-weeniest little thi-

00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:18.600
Actually, the soundtrack's not bad.

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:20.000
I mean that, too.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:21.200
For all its problems,

00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:23.700
every single singer in this movie, even our leads,

00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:28.800
sing some really good, surprisingly impressive renditions of timeless classics.

00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:30.400
It's strangely kind of impressive.

00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:34.060
Hell, I might actually pick it up after removing this film's cock from my anus!

00:31:34.060 --> 00:31:35.400
But aside from that,

00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:38.960
this is not only one of the most pointless sequels ever made,

00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:40.500
it's one of the worst.

00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:43.000
It's one of the worst because talented people,

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.200
the same who made a fantastic,

00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:45.900
hilarious,

00:31:45.900 --> 00:31:46.400
unique,

00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:54.300
musical classic so obviously phoned in this half-assed reunion just so they can all sing some karaoke together.

00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:58.020
It's a straight-up insult to the first film, and I can assure you,

00:31:58.020 --> 00:32:02.640
these statues you see of the Blues Brothers don't exist for this piece of shit!

00:32:02.900 --> 00:32:04.600
They exist for something smarter,

00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:05.400
funnier,

00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:06.900
and just all-around better.

00:32:07.100 --> 00:32:09.900
And the fact that THIS is connected to it...

00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:11.800
I...I...

00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:13.700
I need my Fuckital.

00:32:14.260 --> 00:32:16.300
I'm the Nostalgia Critic, and hopefully, in a few minutes,

00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:17.600
I won't remember who I am.

00:32:19.900 --> 00:32:21.400
(offscreen) JESUS SHIT!

00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:53.400
Jake: Bullshit.
