must come to the end and they said we'll
call it an atom and that's how they made

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829

physical nature dimly see a law yeah

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080
physical nature dimly see a law yeah
 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.109

peer into the universe we're seeing a

maybe you discover that as you die maybe

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459
maybe you discover that as you die maybe
 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:33.259
maybe you discover that as you die maybe
as you die you go there's the theory of

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269
as you die you go there's the theory of
 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:37.310
as you die you go there's the theory of
everything boom and you're dead
