00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.320
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:11.510
&gt;&gt; Now we're going to welcome
to the stage Amy Sarig King.

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:26.630
[ Applause ]

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:27.930
&gt;&gt; Amy Sarig King: How's it going?

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.230
Awesome. Hello.

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:30.530
Can you hear me out there?

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:31.830
Fantastic.

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.370
You know, I prepare for
things really seriously.

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.220
I've been writing for 25 years.

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.680
I lecture in places,
and I'm really prepared.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.580
And today, I thought,
I'm going to wing it.

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:45.420
The reason is, is because in
a way, even though I've talked

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.440
about this book in other
places, I've never really figured

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.620
out who the new persona is, right,
because I write young adult novels.

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.560
So I usually talk to university
students and high school students.

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.030
And then I wrote a
middle grade novel.

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.310
And I have a nine-year-old at
home, so I know how I talk to her.

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:05.510
And then it turns out, I talk
to her the exact same way

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:06.810
as I talk to everybody else.

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.080
And I don't have to
invent a persona at all.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.580
I can just be me.

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.710
But I'm here to talk about
"Me and Marvin Gardens."

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.610
It's a novel that's
really close to my heart.

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.070
So I'm going to tell you
a little bit about it,

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:20.740
and then I'm going
to read a tiny but.

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.550 position:56%
But really, because my name is
asking, I'm all about the questions.

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.670
Are you guys up for some
questions and answers?

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.030
Great. You can talk to me
about how it took me 15 years

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:33.280
to get published, or
how I write a book

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.500
or how I tap dance,
any of those things.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.860
I'm open to all of those things.

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.010
But I just want to tell you
a little bit about the book.

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:43.510
It's interesting.

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:46.330
I sat down to write the
book with one thing in mind:

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.620
I wanted to write a book about
an animal that eats plastic

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:55.220
and that could solve the world's
plastic pollution problem.

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.350
And this is interesting
because I love science.

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:58.720
I've always loved science.

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.190
So when I write middle grade,
I get to write about science.

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.950
And I'm writing my next one now,
and there's more science in that.

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.980
Anyway. So I sat down to write
about this animal who eats plastic.

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:14.300
And what actually came out of me
was this 30-year-old story of stuff

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.050
that actually happened to me.

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.370
And this just tends to happen.

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.300
Like I said, I've written
more than 20 novels.

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.080
This happens every time.

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.940
So in this book, you'll
meet Obe Devlin.

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.240
He's a boy.

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.730 position:56%
He grew up simple, in nature,
surrounded by 50 acres of cornfield,

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.460
a bubbling creek, and a
200-year-old oak tree.

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:35.140
And he was connected to the land
through his family's history.

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.210
It was his family's
land at one time.

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:41.780 position:56%
And he only had one best friend, had
one friend because, just like me,

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.550
growing up in the middle
of a cornfield and growing

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.560
up in a rural area, you really only
have one friend if you're lucky.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.550
And they used to explore the
wilderness together, right.

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:54.950
But then, meet the developers,
who buy the wilderness,

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.820
and they level it, and
they plant house seeds,

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:01.710
and then houses grow
instead of corn.

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:06.880 position:56%
And meet the new kids in Obe's new
development, and his best friend has

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.780
to disown him in order to make
friends with these new kids.

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.720
And his life would really
never be the same after that.

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.240
He thought everything was
just bummer from there on out.

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:23.000
But then he meets putrid Annie,
who might have been named after me.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.110
I may have been called
putrid Amy, once at least.

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:28.230
Anyway, she's a nature loving girl,

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.180
and she lives in the
new development too.

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.690
But she teaches Obe that
new kids can be kind.

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:38.530
And then, of course, Obe meets
Marvin Gardens, a strange creature

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:44.250 position:56%
who he finds in the creek one night,
munching on a plastic water bottle.

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.630
So like I said, like Obe,
I grew up in the middle

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:50.700
of that same cornfield, near
that same 200-year-old oak tree.

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:55.110 position:56%
And like Obe, I heard stories about
how that land was our family's land,

00:03:55.110 --> 00:04:00.380
until my grandfather, who was an
alcoholic, drank 175 acres of it

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.770
and left our family with nothing.

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:05.250
And like Obe, I struggled
with new kids, suburban kids,

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.460
who had no interest
in crayfish or dirt.

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:12.740
Except in my case, my best friend
didn't defect to the other side.

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:14.860
She just moved to Connecticut.

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:19.200
But that was the same summer that
the bulldozers came and woke me

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:20.910
up every morning with
that beep, beep, beep,

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:23.040
beep beeping that they
do when they back up.

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.580
The only thing Obe and I don't have

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.810
in common is the plastic
eating animal.

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:28.380
Now I was a farmer in Ireland.

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:29.980
I lived in Ireland for 15 years.

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:31.430
I was a self-sufficient farmer.

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:32.920
And if you want to know
about what that means,

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:34.220
ask me what does that really mean.

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:35.520
But I'll tell you now.

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.810
It means I didn't buy anything
for ten years, not one thing.

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:39.110
Oh, give me a second.

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:40.410
Give me like five more
minutes, all right.

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:43.670
I promise, you'll be
the first one I call on.

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:49.700
So I was on this farm in
Ireland, and I had goats.

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:53.860
And the goats kind of were the
closest thing to Marvin Gardens.

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.860
But honestly, they'll eat anything.

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:00.950
But when I started
researching for this book,

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:03.480
it was kind of interesting
because, I mean,

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:05.470
like this animal only
eats plastic, okay.

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:09.920
Marvin, that's all he eats,
only plastic, like for real.

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:12.380
So some of the research I did

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:14.890
for this book really
bummed me out, you guys.

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:16.190
It really bummed me out.

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:18.470
And I'm sorry to do this
to you right after lunch,

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:22.340
but I'm just going to throw out
a few things that I learned.

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:24.220
So here's two.

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:28.720
It takes a plastic bottle
500 years to decompose.

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:34.570
Americans throw away 2.5 million
of these bottles per hour.

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:40.870
More than 1 million plastic
bags are used every minute.

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:44.890
About 80% of the trash in our
landfills could be recycled.

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:48.510
And then I want to talk to
as well, just for kicks.

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:49.810
I don't know.

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:51.990
Have you guys ever heard of the
Great Pacific Garbage Patch?

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:53.290
Yeah, you've heard of it?

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:54.600
Okay. Some of you might
know about it;

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:55.900 position:56%
some of you might not know about it.

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:59.080
I always saw it, and a lot of
times when we look at the articles

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:03.130
about the Great Pacific Garage
Patch, we see like plastic bottles

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:04.680
and plastic bags floating.

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:06.330
And we've heard it's
the size of Texas.

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:07.950
And then we've heard
this: it's the size

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:09.790
of the continental United States.

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:11.090
In actual fact, it could be either.

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:14.490
Depending on the day, the
size changes quite often.

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:21.940
But the Great Pacific Garbage
Patch is actually not plastic

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:23.240
things floating.

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:26.440
It's not just the way
we imagine garbage.

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:27.740
Some of you may know this,

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:30.700
but the Great Pacific Garbage Patch
is an area in the Pacific gyre,

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:34.410
which is the middle of the Pacific,
okay, where the water has become

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:39.180 position:56%
so polluted with microplastics, that
means like tiny plastics, all right,

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:41.040
that it almost looks like gel.

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:45.640 position:56%
Now think of the size of Texas, size
of the continental United States.

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:48.850
And it almost looks like gel, or
actually, Obe in the book refers

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:53.950
to it as confetti gel because there
are so many trillions of pieces

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:57.640
of tiny, little microplastics
in this water.

00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:01.200
Actually, just to bum you out a
little more after lunch, sorry,

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:02.980
there are two major garbage patches

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:04.520
in the Pacific and
one in the Atlantic.

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:07.750
We just don't talk about
that one very much.

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:10.740
So before writing this
book, I recycled casually.

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:12.830
Now, I recycle like a maniac.

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:15.490
I was going upstairs, putting
my Fritos in the one place

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:17.180
and the bag in the other.

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:18.480
That's me.

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:20.360
But I also started
calling my best friend,

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:22.670
who moved to Connecticut,
more often.

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:27.120 position:56%
And it also made me rescue a kitten,
okay, because when I left the farm

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:30.060
in Ireland, that would be 13
years ago, I left it all behind.

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:31.360
I loved that farm.

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:32.660
I built it with my two hands.

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:35.130
Well actually, my husband and
I built it with our four hands.

00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:36.430
I should give him some credit.

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:38.300
But I had had animals.

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:40.770
I went from walking around
with chickens on my shoulders

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:45.450
and having goats and chasing horses
that got lose and I came back

00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:48.250
to America and I decided
no pets, no animals.

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:49.550
That's it.

00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:52.260
I became this like
cold pet-less person.

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:56.390
And then I adopted this kitten,
and her name is Ziggy Jack.

00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:58.630
And she's brought me back
to the person that I was

00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:00.230
when I was actually Obe's age,

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:04.580
because though I was severely
allergic to cats at that age,

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:06.580
all I wanted was a kitten.

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:10.540
And now, I'm not severely allergic
anymore, and now I've got a kitten.

00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:12.580
So basically, if you know me
and you're here, if you know me

00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:13.880
for my other work, if you know me

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:16.700
from any place you've ever
seen me speak, if you read "Me

00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:18.890
and Marvin Gardens," you're going
to see a little bit of me in it

00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:21.490
because really, it's
my family's life.

00:08:21.490 --> 00:08:26.540 position:56%
I was thrilled to be able to explore
what was going on 100 years ago

00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:30.630
when my grandfather
was losing our land.

00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:32.190
But it would be Obe's
great-grandfather.

00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:35.370
I'm going to read a
tiny piece of the book.

00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:37.340
And checking my time.

00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:40.270
And then I'm just going to
go for questions and answers

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:42.350
because you guys look
really curious.

00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:44.590
And I mean that in the nice way.

00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:51.000
I'm going to read you just a
little piece of how Obe and Annie,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.980
his friend Annie on the bus, and
how they interact with each other.

00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:58.650
And so, let's see.

00:08:58.650 --> 00:09:00.790
You need to know, all right,
Obe lives on the farm.

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:02.220 position:56%
They're starting build these houses.

00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:04.190
Annie lives in the
development as well.

00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:08.170
So she's on the same
bus route as him.

00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:09.800 position:56%
And if I've forgotten anything else,

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:11.420
I'll just throw it
in while I'm reading.

00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:13.110
That's just how I roll today.

00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:19.890
So okay. And Mike,
Mike was his -- Sorry.

00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:23.700
Tommy is his old best friend, and
Tommy's new best friend is Mike.

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:26.660
He's kind of mean because
mean people exist.

00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:27.960
I still don't understand that.

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:29.260
I just want to let you know.

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:30.600
I don't know how mean
people exist, but they do.

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:32.330
All right.

00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:34.520
We had seating assignments
on the bus.

00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:37.950
Six months ago, Tommy switched
to sit with his new friend Mike.

00:09:37.950 --> 00:09:41.330
And the bus driver told him that
it was the only switch he'd get.

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:44.000
In the switch, I got to
sit next to Annie Bell,

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:49.200 position:56%
who the boys called putrid Annie
because she threw up in school once.

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:52.740
Annie was in the fifth grade and
moved here from Portland, Oregon,

00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:54.710
right before winter break.

00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:57.010
She lived in phase one
of the development.

00:09:57.010 --> 00:09:59.900
I liked her because she was the one
kid on the bus who wasn't trying

00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:02.320
to prove something to anyone.

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:05.700 position:56%
She said the boys who called her
putrid Annie were just dumb and weak

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:07.660
because they couldn't
think for themselves.

00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:09.000
And that was probably true.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.170
The only thing I really knew about
Mike, Tommy's new best friend,

00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:14.550
was that he'd accidently shot
his younger brother in the foot

00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:17.020
with a BB gun when he was little.

00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:18.910
His little brother still
had the BB in his foot.

00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:20.560
I'd seen it.

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:23.870
Other than that, Mike didn't seem
to have much of a personality.

00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:25.260
He didn't have hobbies.

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:26.560
He didn't get good grades.

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:29.720
He didn't care about much.

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:31.610
Annie cared about pretty
much everything.

00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:36.130
She loved two things
especially: rocks and water.

00:10:36.130 --> 00:10:37.500
Sorry, I mean weather.

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:39.220
I don't know what's
wrong with these glasses.

00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:40.520
It's not me.

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:41.820
It's the glasses.

00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:43.120
Rocks and weather.

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:45.680
She wanted to be a
geologist or a meteorologist.

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:48.370
Whenever she found a rock, she'd
talk about how old it might be.

00:10:48.370 --> 00:10:51.550
She told me all about
the geologic timescale,

00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:55.020
which was like pretending the
earth was a cake, with layers,

00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:57.360
and some layers were
older than other layers.

00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:01.150
She also believed the weather
in Portland, Oregon was superior

00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:03.770
to the weather in Reading,
Pennsylvania.

00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:08.500
So we'd argue about that sometimes
but never really argue, argue.

00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:11.140
Annie played the cello.

00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:12.500
I also played the cello.

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:14.390
So I get to be Obe and
Annie in this book.

00:11:14.390 --> 00:11:15.690
It's kind of weird.

00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:17.960
Anyway. Annie played the cello.

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:20.880
So on orchestra days, she'd
have to fit both herself

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:22.950
and her cello into our seat.

00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:26.060
Because of how big the cello was,
she had to squeeze in close to me

00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:28.230 position:56%
and put the cello in the aisle seat.

00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:29.620
I didn't mind.

00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:32.240
There was nothing putrid
about Annie.

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:36.210
What's wrong with you, she asked
when she got on that morning.

00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:39.510
What? You look happy or something.

00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:41.360
I can't be happy?

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:42.720
Not on a Tuesday, no.

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:45.740
She said, you're supposed to
be mopey and kind of annoyed.

00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:47.040
I laughed.

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:48.340
Oh my gosh, you're laughing now.

00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:49.640
That's worrying.

00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:51.640
Stop it or I'll laugh more, I said.

00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:52.940
I'll be you then.

00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:54.470
Look, mopey, annoyed.

00:11:54.470 --> 00:11:57.970
She held her face in
this frozen look of pain.

00:11:57.970 --> 00:12:00.520
Is that what it was
like to be my friend,

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:03.140
to have to look at
that all the time?

00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:05.390
The bus was worse than
anywhere else, I knew that.

00:12:05.390 --> 00:12:06.950
Tommy and his new friends
were there.

00:12:06.950 --> 00:12:09.120
Maybe I was happier off the bus.

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:10.890
I couldn't tell.

00:12:10.890 --> 00:12:14.840
It's hard to see yourself when
you are yourself, I guess.

00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:17.320
Annie still had that look on her
face, like she was trying hard

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:19.100
to look mean or something.

00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:20.990
You can stop now, I said.

00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:22.840
Good. She smiled.

00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:25.150
It's tiring being you.

00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:27.930
I reached into my pocket and
found the tiny rock I'd picked

00:12:27.930 --> 00:12:29.230
up at the creek.

00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:30.530
I gave it to her.

00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:31.830
Quartzite.

00:12:31.830 --> 00:12:33.130
She said, good job rock hound.

00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:37.010
I smiled. I'm going to leave it at
that because you guys look curious.

00:12:37.010 --> 00:12:39.790
But I'm not telling you
the spoilers in this book.

00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:43.230 position:56%
There is a mystery animal, and there
is a secret that Marvin Gardens has.

00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:44.600
He's not all great.

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:47.070
And eating plastic bottles
does have its side effects.

00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:48.770
That's all I'm going to say.

00:12:48.770 --> 00:12:52.320
But if anything, if I
can make, I don't know,

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:55.880
if I can make us all think a
little bit more about pollution

00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:59.090
and what we do with our trash and
what we do when we walk by trash

00:12:59.090 --> 00:13:02.910
on the street, then I feel
like I've done my job.

00:13:02.910 --> 00:13:07.000
So I'm going to go to
questions and answers now.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.310
And I already promised
somebody he'd be the first one.

00:13:09.310 --> 00:13:10.610
Hold up. Where were you?

00:13:10.610 --> 00:13:11.910
Is that you?

00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:14.210
Yes. You're going to
have really yell.

00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:19.030
&gt;&gt; I like science too.

00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:20.330
&gt;&gt; Amy Sarig King:
You like science too?

00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:21.630
All right.

00:13:21.630 --> 00:13:22.930
I love science.

00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:25.280
Yes. Oh, I didn't hear you.

00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:28.970
What? You love nature.

00:13:28.970 --> 00:13:30.660 position:56%
What's your favorite part of nature?

00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:34.070
Trees, birds, what?

00:13:34.070 --> 00:13:36.120
Having fun with it.

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:38.830
Awesome. Excellent.

00:13:38.830 --> 00:13:40.210
Nature is awesome.

00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:41.510
There's no doubt about it.

00:13:41.510 --> 00:13:42.810
I'm coming over there in a second.

00:13:42.810 --> 00:13:44.110
Yes.

00:13:44.110 --> 00:13:45.410
&gt;&gt; Are you going to write a sequel?

00:13:45.410 --> 00:13:46.710
&gt;&gt; Amy Sarig King: Am I
going to write a sequel?

00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:48.860
I'm not. I am not a sequel writer.

00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:53.310 position:56%
I have about eight or nine published
novels and none of them are --

00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:55.220
They're connected funnily enough.

00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:56.570
A lot of time, they're
set in the same place.

00:13:56.570 --> 00:13:59.630
So the next one is set
in a similar place,

00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:01.910
but they're not connected, no.

00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:08.790
Yes. Am I going to
publish another book?

00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:11.880
I'm going to publish books
till I die, if they let me.

00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:14.280
That's pretty much my whole point.

00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:15.580
I hear you back there, Mary.

00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:18.080
Can't miss that laugh.

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:19.380
You're awesome.

00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:22.960
Yeah, until I'm toast, I'm going
to publish books because I'm here

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:25.800
to ask questions and
help you ask questions.

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:27.860
What else do you have?

00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:29.170 position:56%
You've got to have something for me.

00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:36.470
Yeah. What is the plastic
eating creature called?

00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:38.350
He's name Marvin Gardens.

00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:41.760 position:56%
And you won't believe it, but he has
a wife, and her name is Boardwalk.

00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:44.350
Do any of you ever play -- I know.

00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:47.230
Have you ever played Monopoly?

00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:51.520
There's a lot of monopoly fun in
this book and not so much fun, too,

00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:52.820
because their dad plays with them,

00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:55.040
and he always wins,
just like my dad.

00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:56.970
Actually, I'm 47 years old.

00:14:56.970 --> 00:15:01.930
And last month, I beat my father
in ping-pong for the first time,

00:15:01.930 --> 00:15:05.560
and I gloated and I
strutted around the place

00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:07.580
because he never let
me win as a child.

00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:09.830
And then he wanted a
rematch and I said no.

00:15:09.830 --> 00:15:11.650
It was awesome.

00:15:11.650 --> 00:15:13.460
Somebody had their hand
up over that direction,

00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:17.410
but I don't know who it was.

00:15:17.410 --> 00:15:19.640
All right.

00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:22.910
Yes. What's my favorite
thing to what?

00:15:22.910 --> 00:15:25.770
Oh, what was my favorite
thing to do on the farm.

00:15:25.770 --> 00:15:28.420
Wow, that's a great question.

00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:30.070
I really loved breeding chickens.

00:15:30.070 --> 00:15:31.540
Here's a weird sorry for you.

00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:32.890
This will be weird.

00:15:32.890 --> 00:15:34.480
You ready?

00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:38.540
So since I was self-sufficient,
I didn't make any money, okay.

00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:40.300
I grew my own food.

00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:43.130
I grew my own whatever I
was eating, whether it was,

00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:46.760
sorry for the vegetarians in the
room, whether it was a chicken

00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:50.350 position:56%
or whether I could trade some things
for half of another sort of animal

00:15:50.350 --> 00:15:51.700
or whether it was vegetables.

00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:53.000
I grew everything myself.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.550
So I didn't have any money.

00:15:54.550 --> 00:15:56.790
So all this time, I
was writing, right.

00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:58.190
So I finally got a computer.

00:15:58.190 --> 00:15:59.490
I built one actually.

00:15:59.490 --> 00:16:03.090
And, I mean, I built
one out of components.

00:16:03.090 --> 00:16:06.420
I didn't make the components
because that would be crazy.

00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:09.900
But I built this computer, and I
was writing novels on the computer

00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:12.360
because I started on
a typewriter, right.

00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:17.170
And the only way I could send my
books out and the letters out to go

00:16:17.170 --> 00:16:21.770
like to publishers was I had
to hatch chickens or ducks.

00:16:21.770 --> 00:16:23.660
And I bred rare poultry.

00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:24.960
So I got some decent money.

00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:29.060
Like per chicken, I'd maybe
get 20, 20 euros per chicken.

00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:32.070
But I'd have to wait 21 weeks.

00:16:32.070 --> 00:16:35.270 position:56%
So if I thought about it, okay, I
finish this novel, I'd have to think

00:16:35.270 --> 00:16:38.790
about how many different agents
or publishers I wanted to query

00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:43.040
and then hatch so many
chickens to cover the postage

00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:46.760
and the photocopying and all
that stuff in order to send.

00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:48.720
So the long answer was that one.

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:50.140
The short answer is chickens.

00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:52.170
My favorite thing was chickens.

00:16:52.170 --> 00:16:53.640
I loved my chickens.

00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:56.990
I had some epic chickens.

00:16:56.990 --> 00:16:59.290
Yes, sir.

00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:09.730
I need you to speak up.

00:17:09.730 --> 00:17:11.030
Oh, wonderful.

00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:12.330
Got you. All right.

00:17:12.330 --> 00:17:14.630
What does Marvin Gardens look like?

00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:17.940
Well, you see, I can't tell
you because it's a secret.

00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:19.730
But I can tell you
he's kind of slimy.

00:17:19.730 --> 00:17:23.460
And when you pet him, it
kind of feels like snot.

00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:25.520
That's all I can tell you.

00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:28.060
Because he's an animal that's
never been discovered before.

00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:29.760
So he's kind of like a hog and kind

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:32.230
of like a dog and kind
of like a mix.

00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:35.700
The whole point of that part of
the book is your imagination.

00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:39.330
Yeah. But he is slimy, like algae.

00:17:39.330 --> 00:17:42.630
Yeah. What?

00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:48.090
I used to name my chickens till
I started to eat my chickens.

00:17:48.090 --> 00:17:52.190
And then I realized it was really
a bad idea to name your chickens.

00:17:52.190 --> 00:17:55.360
So I do remember one
named Edna very fondly.

00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:56.720
She was a lovely chicken.

00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:59.020
But after that, no, no.

00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:00.730
I didn't name my goats either.

00:18:00.730 --> 00:18:05.480
I'm scanning.

00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:06.780
What else you got?

00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:12.150
Yes. Is your hand up?

00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:13.510
Yeah? Excellent question.

00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:15.300
How long did it take me to write?

00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:19.380
This book took me probably
about probably a year to write.

00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:21.470
Sometimes it depends
on the book, you know.

00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:23.650
Sometimes it takes me ten
years to write a book;

00:18:23.650 --> 00:18:26.370
sometimes it takes me a few months,

00:18:26.370 --> 00:18:28.760
but everything has
to do with rewriting.

00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:32.130
So I can write the book down,
but I have to keep writing it

00:18:32.130 --> 00:18:34.370
and writing it to make it
better and better and better,

00:18:34.370 --> 00:18:36.270
you know, make things match.

00:18:36.270 --> 00:18:37.710
So about a year.

00:18:37.710 --> 00:18:43.900
Yeah. Have I ever had
to do page one rewrite?

00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:47.380
Every day of my life, all the time.

00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:49.160 position:56%
Yeah. Rewriting's my favorite thing.

00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:50.460
Revision is everything.

00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:53.150
I always say revision is
the sport, because it is.

00:18:53.150 --> 00:18:54.940
It's like the thing you train for.

00:18:54.940 --> 00:18:57.530
You get that first draft down
and then you realize some

00:18:57.530 --> 00:18:58.830
of the stuff doesn't make sense,

00:18:58.830 --> 00:19:00.330
and then you have to
connect it, you know.

00:19:00.330 --> 00:19:04.490
But is page one rewrite
like a specific thing?

00:19:04.490 --> 00:19:07.550
Oh yeah, I start over all the time.

00:19:07.550 --> 00:19:08.850
You bet. Absolutely.

00:19:08.850 --> 00:19:12.520
Although in fairness, this page
started similarly to how I did it

00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:19.200
in the first draft,
but it got better.

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:22.010
Yeah. Which book do I like
the best that I've written?

00:19:22.010 --> 00:19:27.450
That's -- It's the
weirdest book I ever wrote.

00:19:27.450 --> 00:19:28.950
And it's actually for
an older audience.

00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:31.800
It's for older teenagers
and for adults.

00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:34.700
It's called "I Crawl Through It."

00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:37.730
And it's a very strange book.

00:19:37.730 --> 00:19:39.680
I think it's one of
the only surrealism,

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:43.670
what they call pure
surrealism, for teenagers.

00:19:43.670 --> 00:19:48.090
I tend to be a bit
surreal anyway, so.

00:19:48.090 --> 00:19:49.390
Yes.

00:19:49.390 --> 00:19:52.240
&gt;&gt; What's the best
writing advice you ever got

00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:53.920
from an elementary school teacher?

00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:55.220
&gt;&gt; Amy Sarig King:

00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:58.640
From an elementary school
teacher, best writing advice.

00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:01.820
I had two of them that
used to hit me on the hand

00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:03.120
because I didn't hold
my pencil right.

00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:07.290
So I'm not going to
give them any credit.

00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:10.440
Can I -- Well, I think
librarians are teachers too.

00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:13.080
So actually, the best
writing advice I ever got was

00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:18.780 position:56%
from my elementary school librarian,
where any question I asked her,

00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:23.300
it was Max and the Wild Things,
and I said, does he really go.

00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:25.910
Does he really go to the
land of the wild things?

00:20:25.910 --> 00:20:28.720
And she said, I don't know,
Amy, what do you think.

00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:31.180
And I feel that my entire
career is owed to her.

00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:32.480
Her name is Dawn Moan
[assumed spelling].

00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:34.580
We're now Facebook friends,
and so I get to write

00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:36.020
to her every now and
again and thank her.

00:20:36.020 --> 00:20:39.250
But honestly, making
me think for myself,

00:20:39.250 --> 00:20:40.810
making me answer questions instead

00:20:40.810 --> 00:20:42.850
of telling me what
the book was about,

00:20:42.850 --> 00:20:44.160
asking me what I thought it was

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:48.010
about was probably the smartest
thing any educator ever did for me.

00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:52.130
Oh, hey, educators in the room.

00:20:52.130 --> 00:20:56.410
Rock on. That's a true story.

00:20:56.410 --> 00:20:57.940
All right.

00:20:57.940 --> 00:21:01.560
Yes. Did I write the Wild Things?

00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:03.830
I wish. No.

00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:05.940
No. Maurice Sendak
wrote the Wild Things.

00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:08.510
It's such a good book, isn't it?

00:21:08.510 --> 00:21:09.810
Is he my friend?

00:21:09.810 --> 00:21:11.110
No, sadly.

00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:12.410
I'd like him to be my
friend, but that'll have

00:21:12.410 --> 00:21:15.510
to happen at a later date.

00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:25.300
[inaudible]

00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:27.100
Yeah.

[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:33.500
To be a writer?

00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:34.980
Honestly, when it comes
to young kids,

00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:39.330
because I have this nine-year-old
who was once a seven-year-old,

00:21:39.330 --> 00:21:43.630
and she wouldn't tell you
because her mom's a writer.

00:21:43.630 --> 00:21:44.930
So she doesn't want to be a writer.

00:21:44.930 --> 00:21:47.130
But she has it, she has it.

00:21:47.130 --> 00:21:50.810
And the two things that I
would recommend is reading,

00:21:50.810 --> 00:21:54.500
a lot of reading, and
a lot of writing,

00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:58.480
and using your imagination
completely.

00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:00.440
Like, my daughter once
said to me, she said, well,

00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:02.800
I don't think I'm allowed to
draw the pictures in my book.

00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:04.360
And I said, well, why
would you think that.

00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:06.490
Of course, you can draw
the pictures in your book.

00:22:06.490 --> 00:22:09.000
And so, she came back to
me with this picture book

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.150
about unicorns and, you know.

00:22:11.150 --> 00:22:14.880
But the other thing is that, and
it's hard sometimes depending

00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:18.480
on the age group and what age you
are, but I think a writer needs

00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:22.090
to be able to spend time by
themselves and not be bored

00:22:22.090 --> 00:22:24.200
and not always have -- And
that's the one thing I found

00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:25.500
with my daughter.

00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:27.880
So if you're bored and
it's summer vacation still,

00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:29.420
which I don't think it
is down here anymore,

00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:31.700
but if you're bored
next summer vacation,

00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:36.390
instead of going I'm bored,
sit down with some paper

00:22:36.390 --> 00:22:37.780
and see what you can come up with.

00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:40.010
And don't try and plan
everything out.

00:22:40.010 --> 00:22:41.480
Is that the second grader there?

00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:42.780
Is that her?

00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:44.080
Oh, okay, maybe.

00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:45.380
All right.

00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:46.680
Don't try and plan everything out.

00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:48.030
Just sit down and go have fun.

00:22:48.030 --> 00:22:53.740
Have fun. It takes a while, so why
not have fun while you're doing it?

00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:56.460
So that's the best I can do.

00:22:56.460 --> 00:22:58.770
I only got about three minutes,

00:22:58.770 --> 00:23:03.040
so only a few more burning
questions, if you have any.

00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:08.510
Yes, sir. I'm so sorry.

00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:16.380
Do I think the plastic
problem could be solved?

00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:17.680
It's pretty big.

00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:22.960
And we have so many different types
of cultures in our world, right.

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:24.720
We have so many different places.

00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:28.570
I can't do anything about
what other countries do.

00:23:28.570 --> 00:23:33.800
I think the earth will probably
solve it one way or the other.

00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:36.030
But I think that it'll
actually really harm us.

00:23:36.030 --> 00:23:39.120
I mean, it's the same as what we're
seeing with climate change now.

00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:41.560
It is real.

00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:44.890
And I'll fistfight you for
that, not you personally,

00:23:44.890 --> 00:23:46.530
but anybody who wants
to say it's not.

00:23:46.530 --> 00:23:49.740
But the idea that it's
costing us so much money

00:23:49.740 --> 00:23:51.310
and costing lives and
all these things.

00:23:51.310 --> 00:23:55.190 position:56%
Plastic pollution is doing the same
thing, usually actually in countries

00:23:55.190 --> 00:23:56.700
that we don't talk about much.

00:23:56.700 --> 00:23:59.600
So Southeast Asia.

00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:06.640 position:56%
It's really causing a huge amount of
problems in the actual population.

00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:08.020
So I don't know.

00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:09.320
I don't know can it be solved.

00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:10.820
I'd like to think it can be.

00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:12.930
I think we have to
start at the source.

00:24:12.930 --> 00:24:14.230
What are we going to do
with this bottle today?

00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:15.530
We're going to recycle it, right?

We're going to recycle it, right?

00:24:17.430 --> 00:24:20.180
And if we can't recycle it, we'll
bring it home and recycle it

00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:23.180 position:56%
or we'll say to the teacher at
school, do you have a recycling bin.

00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:24.730
Yes? Sound good?

That's what I do when
I go to schools.

They look at me like I'm
crazy, but I'm used to that.

I know. It's weird.

00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:48.420
I mean, it's funny.

00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:51.020
There's a part in the book where
Obe turns around to his father

00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:52.570
and he says, plastics
ruined everything.

00:24:52.570 --> 00:24:54.190
And he goes, oh really,
plastics ruined everything.

00:24:54.190 --> 00:24:57.400
And then he opens up the fridge,
and he says, look at this.

00:24:57.400 --> 00:25:00.470
You milk, your yogurt,
your cheese, your meat.

00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:01.860
And he just starts
listing everything.

00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:05.190
Ketchup, your chocolate
syrup, this syrup,

00:25:05.190 --> 00:25:07.160
all these -- Everything's
in plastic.

00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:09.090
So it's not doing you -- And
look at the whole fridge.

00:25:09.090 --> 00:25:10.430
It's plastic.

You know, it's not hurting you.

those things that we have that sort

of blinker vision on, you know.

00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:19.050
But yeah, it's annoying.

00:25:19.050 --> 00:25:21.170
I mean, I'd like to see, as
someone who goes to a lot

00:25:21.170 --> 00:25:24.070
of schools throughout
the year, I would really

like, hey, what's up with this.

00:25:43.820 --> 00:25:50.470
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:54.080
I did purposely go with my full
name because my father used to say,

00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:55.670
why aren't you using
my name anymore.

00:25:55.670 --> 00:25:56.970
And that's a joke.

00:25:56.970 --> 00:25:59.960
It was really just because,
yeah, I purposely did that.

00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:02.230
And it was invigorating.

00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:06.550 position:56%
It was totally different, and I love
working with a different age group.

00:26:06.550 --> 00:26:09.720 position:56%
I still connect most with teenagers.

00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:12.140
But that's not even true.

00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:14.140
I like connecting with
nine-year olds.

00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:15.440
I like connecting with
eight-year olds.

00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:18.610
So yeah. So far, so good.

00:26:18.610 --> 00:26:20.150
It's been really quite cool.

00:26:20.150 --> 00:26:22.300
That's why I'm writing another
one, because it's been interesting.

00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:25.750
But I'm writing young adult, then
adult at the same time too, so.

Thank you so much for all your great
questions and for listening today.

00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:32.410
Don't forget to recycle
your bottles, all right?

00:26:32.410 --> 00:26:34.710
Promise?

00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:39.910
