first thing I would say is that if you

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019
first thing I would say is that if you
 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.620
first thing I would say is that if you
have intense chronic pain then my heart

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630
have intense chronic pain then my heart
 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.269
have intense chronic pain then my heart
goes out to you because that's really

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279
goes out to you because that's really
 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.820
goes out to you because that's really
awful and so I think that you can cut

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830
awful and so I think that you can cut
 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.740
awful and so I think that you can cut

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750
yourself a break I think the fact that
 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.580

I guess the first thing I would ask you

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290
I guess the first thing I would ask you
 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.110
I guess the first thing I would ask you
is if your pain has been reasonably

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120
is if your pain has been reasonably
 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.240
is if your pain has been reasonably
managed you probably know this and I'm

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250
managed you probably know this and I'm
 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.619
managed you probably know this and I'm
not giving you any medical advice

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629
not giving you any medical advice
 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.110
not giving you any medical advice
because I can't but you might want to

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120
because I can't but you might want to
 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.660
because I can't but you might want to
note that there are antidepressants that

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670
note that there are antidepressants that
 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.819
note that there are antidepressants that
are quite effective as long-term pain

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829
are quite effective as long-term pain
 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.470
are quite effective as long-term pain
medications and you may already know

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480
medications and you may already know
 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.020
medications and you may already know
that but if you don't then you should

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030
that but if you don't then you should
 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.279
that but if you don't then you should
check that out because they're not

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289
check that out because they're not
 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.290
check that out because they're not
addictive and they can be a very

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300
addictive and they can be a very
 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.050
addictive and they can be a very
effective adjunct I would also say that

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060
effective adjunct I would also say that
 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.240
effective adjunct I would also say that
the literature on chronic pain tends to

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250
the literature on chronic pain tends to
 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.609
the literature on chronic pain tends to
indicate that more activity is better

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619
indicate that more activity is better
 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.100
indicate that more activity is better
than less and that and that's partly

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110
than less and that and that's partly
 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.570
than less and that and that's partly
because when you get engaged in

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580
because when you get engaged in
 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.149
because when you get engaged in
something that's meaningful let's say

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159
something that's meaningful let's say
 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:22.100
something that's meaningful let's say
and important to you that that activates

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110
and important to you that that activates
 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.230
and important to you that that activates
the dopaminergic system the same system

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240
the dopaminergic system the same system
 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.539
the dopaminergic system the same system
that cocaine activates and that can

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549
that cocaine activates and that can
 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.429
that cocaine activates and that can
produce a fairly pronounced analgesic

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439
produce a fairly pronounced analgesic
 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.830
produce a fairly pronounced analgesic
effect so I would say everything that

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840
effect so I would say everything that
 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.319
effect so I would say everything that
you can do to get yourself occupied with

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329
you can do to get yourself occupied with
 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:34.910
you can do to get yourself occupied with
things that you regard as important and

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920
things that you regard as important and
 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.380
things that you regard as important and
worthwhile is actually probably going to

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390
worthwhile is actually probably going to
 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.270
worthwhile is actually probably going to
help you manage your pain better it

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280
help you manage your pain better it
 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.950
help you manage your pain better it
looks like inactivity is a bad is bad

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960
looks like inactivity is a bad is bad
 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.330
looks like inactivity is a bad is bad
generally speaking for chronic pain I

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340
generally speaking for chronic pain I
 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.280
generally speaking for chronic pain I
mean obviously that's not the case if

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290
mean obviously that's not the case if
 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.560
mean obviously that's not the case if
the sort of activity that you're engaged

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570
the sort of activity that you're engaged
 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.999
the sort of activity that you're engaged
in is of the type that will aggravate an

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:52.009
in is of the type that will aggravate an
 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:54.319
in is of the type that will aggravate an
underlying chronic physiological

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329
underlying chronic physiological
 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.920
underlying chronic physiological
condition but I would say make a plan

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930
condition but I would say make a plan
 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.940
condition but I would say make a plan
make a daily plan make a weekly plan

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950
make a daily plan make a weekly plan
 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.010
make a daily plan make a weekly plan
make it you know push yourself a little

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020
make it you know push yourself a little
 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.600
make it you know push yourself a little
bit farther than you can go comfortably

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610
bit farther than you can go comfortably
 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.359
bit farther than you can go comfortably
on a weekly basis and see how far you

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369
on a weekly basis and see how far you
 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:09.020
on a weekly basis and see how far you
can get any

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030
can get any
 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.510
can get any
year that's because what's your choice I

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520
year that's because what's your choice I
 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.240
year that's because what's your choice I
mean you're laying there suffering is

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250
mean you're laying there suffering is
 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.699
mean you're laying there suffering is
not preferable to doing things and

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709
not preferable to doing things and
 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:20.120
not preferable to doing things and
suffering not generally so I would say

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130
suffering not generally so I would say
 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.160
suffering not generally so I would say
like more power to you for trying and

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170
like more power to you for trying and
 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.500
like more power to you for trying and
but but also do keep in mind that

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510
but but also do keep in mind that
 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.500
but but also do keep in mind that
activity meaningful activity is a good

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510
activity meaningful activity is a good
 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.820

analgesic so Eric Butler says sheesh

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830
analgesic so Eric Butler says sheesh
 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.490
analgesic so Eric Butler says sheesh
Canadians never get it well I don't know

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500
Canadians never get it well I don't know
 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.620
Canadians never get it well I don't know
we get it sometimes Eric come on now you

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630
we get it sometimes Eric come on now you
 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.479
we get it sometimes Eric come on now you
know give us a break we're just

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489
know give us a break we're just
 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:40.160
know give us a break we're just
Canadians we're freezing to death half

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170
Canadians we're freezing to death half
 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.470
Canadians we're freezing to death half
the time so you know we do pretty well

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480
the time so you know we do pretty well
 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.080
the time so you know we do pretty well
given the fact that every day here in

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090
given the fact that every day here in
 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.400
given the fact that every day here in
the winter is the equivalent of a

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410
the winter is the equivalent of a
 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.890
the winter is the equivalent of a
national catastrophe in the US so

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900
national catastrophe in the US so
 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:54.020
national catastrophe in the US so
anyways Betsey Kirkland says if the

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030
anyways Betsey Kirkland says if the
 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.670
anyways Betsey Kirkland says if the
Second Amendment is taken away there

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680
Second Amendment is taken away there
 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.110
Second Amendment is taken away there
will be nothing to protect your freedom

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120
will be nothing to protect your freedom
 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.240

of speech that is how important yes yes

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250
of speech that is how important yes yes
 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:00.949
of speech that is how important yes yes
well that is certainly the argument that

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959
well that is certainly the argument that
 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:05.479
well that is certainly the argument that
people who are motivated to protect the

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489
people who are motivated to protect the
 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:07.280
people who are motivated to protect the
second Amendment make and I'm not going

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290
second Amendment make and I'm not going
 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.370
second Amendment make and I'm not going
to oppose that so
