00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.180
As the old saying goes, “good artists copy,
but great artists steal.”

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:15.320
Since the beginning of time, people have drawn
on the same classic stories in making brand

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.910
new ones, in books, films, or anything in
between.

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.120
But when your inspiration is half a world
away, it can be tempting to copy a few extra

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.380
details – or sometimes, your entire story.

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:29.199
Those responsible may claim that it’s all
one big coincidence, but we’ll let you decide.

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:32.510

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:38.390
Here are Screenrant’s Anime Films That Were
Ripped Off By Hollywood Movies.

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:39.390
Inception

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.980
Christopher Nolan's story of operatives invading
and stealing from a person's dream was one

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:44.800
of the most original blockbusters in years.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.100
But it owes some of that credit to the Japanese
film Paprika, based on a novel by the same

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.100
name.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.899
The stories differ, but Paprika was also built
on the idea of misusing dream technology,

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:56.680
breaking into patients' minds as part of a
dream therapy.

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:01.039
Nolan admitted the anime was used as inspiration
for his film, even if it didn't go quite so

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:02.270
far in bending reality.

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:07.280
A live-action Paprika was in development in
2010, but when Inception stole the show, updates

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.090
stopped completely.

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.090
Pacific Rim

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.550
In the 1990s, the Japanese anime scene was
in a bit of a slump - until Neon Genesis Evangelion

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:15.550
came along.

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.970
Audiences instantly fell in love with the
show's young hero, using his mind to pilot

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.020
a massive mech in battle against enormous
alien monsters.

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.410
And trying to befriend a quiet, withdrawn
fellow pilot.

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:28.750
If that plot sounds familiar, you're probably
a fan of Pacific Rim, a movie that drew from

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.820
too many anime and mecha stories to count.

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.220
The director and writer claim they never saw
the original anime, but the similarities seem

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.390
a lot more than just coincidence.

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.910
The Matrix

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:41.390
Some movies steal ideas or style from an anime
hit and keep it quiet.

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.110
But the Wachowskis have always been open about
the debt they owe to Ghost in the Shell, a

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.940
cyberpunk tale of futuristic cyborg agents.

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.890
The PLOT may not be a match, but the action,
style and setting are.

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.750
Apparently, the anime was actually the entire
pitch for the film.

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.280
The Wachowskis simply showed it to producer
Joel Silver, then told him they planned to

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.560
make it in live-action.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.470
The deal was done, and comparing the two movies
shows the directors pulled it off.

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.780
Dark City

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.310
Released just a year before The Matrix, this
dark tale of a dystopic future has also been

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.860
pointed to as a source of inspiration for
the Wachowskis, with the films even sharing

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:13.890
some of the same sets.

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.940
But director Alex Proyas has actually pointed
to one world famous anime as a direct influence.

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.730
The original manga and anime versions of Akira
became iconic hits, and Dark City’s climactic

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.920
battle is an obvious homage to the final battle
in the animated film too.

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.250
The director calls it a homage, but put the
scenes side by side, and fans might see a

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:32.950
stronger similarity.

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:33.950
Van Helsing

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.780
In Bram Stoker's original "Dracula," Abraham
van Helsing was introduced as an aging, science-minded

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:39.780
man of action.

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.420
It was only later versions that made Van Helsing
a seasoned Vampire hunter, but the Japanese

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.940
anime "Vampire Hunter D" created a truly original
and unmatched hunter of the undead.

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:53.010
In a world mixing steampunk, magic and science
fiction, the half-vampire D looked more like

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.800
a cowboy, with a long black cloak, and large
hat and hair to protect him from the sun as

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.610
he hunted down monsters of the dark.

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.580
The allusions to the original Dracula through
dozens of novels and animated films eventually

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:04.930
made their way to the west.

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.630
So when a blockbuster Van Helsing was greenlit
in 2007, the filmmakers re-imagined the old

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.120
scholar, essentially bringing Vampire Hunter
D to life.

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.310
The Lion King

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.300
As we mentioned in our other video “Popular
Movies That Stole Their Plots From Other Films”,

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:22.480
if Disney’s worldwide hit starring a lion
named Simba seemed familiar at the time, you’re

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.210
definitely not alone.

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:28.150
Even star voice actor Matthew Broderick assumed
the Lion King was an American remake of Kimba

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.970
the White Lion, the famous anime series following
another lion cub who learned the hard way

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:33.610
what it takes to lead.

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:37.490
Even though Disney has denied that they borrowed
from Kimba, exact scenes are copied from one

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:38.490
to the other.

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:43.830
The movie began Disney’s renaissance in
animated films, but may not have done it alone.

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:46.459
Atlantis: The Lost Empire

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:50.440
Seen today as well ahead of its time, Disney’s
Atlantis was seen as a disappointment by the

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.050
studio, criticized for its shift in animation
style and lack of songs.

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:57.590
Maybe Disney had hoped that the film would
be just as popular as the anime series Nadia:

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:01.520
The Secret of Blue Water – a Japanese story
of a strange girl and her brilliant friend

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.850
who board a submarine and cross paths with
Atlantean forces.

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:08.000
Both movies claim to be inspired by Jules
Verne’s Twenty Thousand Leagues Under The

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.959
Sea, but the similarities – down to the
mystical blue crystals worn by both of the

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:15.380
characters – imply something far less innocent.

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:16.380
Black Swan

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.350
On the surface, there doesn’t seem to be
much in common between the story of a young

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:22.660
ballet star and a Japanese pop singer turned
actress.

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:27.400
But when anime fans finally saw Darren Aronofsky’s
Black Swan, they felt differently – with

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.250
some even claiming the film was a re-imagined
remake of Perfect Blue, a film also based

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:35.900
on an up-and-coming star who starts seeing
double, and becomes lost in paranoia and eventually,

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:36.900
murder.

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:41.130
Aronofsky has denied any connection, but the
almost identical scenes and shots are hard

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:42.130
to argue.

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:45.130
Especially after reports surfaced that the
director had gotten the rights to a Perfect

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:48.630
Blue remake when filming Requiem For a Dream
in 2000.

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:49.630
Thanks again for watching!

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:51.050
