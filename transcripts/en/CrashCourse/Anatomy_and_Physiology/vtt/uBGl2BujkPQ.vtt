00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.540
I’d like you to take a second and really
look at yourself.

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:06.649
I don’t mean take stock of your life, which
really isn't any of my business, but I mean just

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:07.709
look at your body.

00:00:07.709 --> 00:00:12.429
Hold up a hand and wiggle it around. Take a sip of
water. Hold your breath. Sniff the air.

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:16.049
These things are so simple for most of us
that we don’t give them a moment’s thought.

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.140
But each one of those things is, oh, SO much
more complex than it feels.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.869
Every movement you make, every new day
that you live to see, is the result of a

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:29.000
collection of systems working together to
function properly.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.010
In short, you, my friend, are a magnificent
beast.

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.260
You are more convoluted and prolific and
polymorphously awesome than you probably even

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:37.829
dare to think.

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.559
For instance, did you know that, if they were all stretched out, your intestines would be about as long

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:43.860
as a three story building is tall?

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.289
Or that by the time you reach old age, you’ll
have produced enough saliva to fill more than

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:50.550
one swimming pool?

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.449
Or that you lose about two-thirds of a kilogram
every year in dead skin cells? And you will

00:00:55.449 --> 00:01:01.190
lose more than 50 kilograms of them in your lifetime?
Just tiny, dried-up pieces of you, drifting

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:07.170
around your house, and settling on your bookshelves,
feeding entire colonies of dust mites.

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.630
You’re your own little world.

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.520
And I’m here to help you get to know the
body that you call a home, through the twin

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.140
disciplines of anatomy - the study of the
structure and relationships between body parts,

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.460
and physiology - the science of how those
parts come together to function, and keep

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.150
that body alive.

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.260
Anatomy is all about what your body is, physiology
is about what it does. And together, they

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:30.910
comprise the science of us.

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:34.150
It’s a complicated science - I’m not gonna
lie to you - and it draws on a lot of other

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:38.040
disciplines, like chemistry and even physics.
And you’ll have to absorb a lot of new terms

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.910
- lots of Latin, gobs of Greek.

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:43.080
But this course isn't just gonna be an inventory of your

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.780
individual parts, or a diagram of how a
slice of pizza gives you energy.

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.090
Because these disciplines are really about
why you’re alive right now, how you came

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:57.140
to be alive, how disease harms you, and how
your body recovers from illness and injury.

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.140
It's about the big-picture things that we
either spend most of our time thinking about,

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.860
or trying not to think about: death, and sex,
and eating, and sleeping, and even the act

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:06.720
of thinking itself.

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.170
They’re all processes that we can understand
through anatomy and physiology.

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.110
If you pay attention, and if I do my job well
enough, you’ll come out of this course with

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.730
a richer, more complete understanding not
only of how your body works, to produce everything

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.820
from a handshake to a heart attacks, but I
think you’ll also start to see that you

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:26.050
really are more than just the sum of your parts.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.100
We have come to understand the living body
by studying a lot of dead ones.

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.080
And for a long time, we did this mostly in
secret.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:45.030
For centuries, the dissection of human bodies
was very taboo in many societies. And as a

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.990
result, the study of anatomy has followed
a long, slow, and often creepy road.

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:54.660
The 2nd century Greek physician Galen gleaned
what he could about the human form by performing

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.410
vivisections on pigs.

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:01.540
Da Vinci poked around dead bodies while sketching
his beautifully detailed anatomical drawings,

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.200
until the pope made him stop.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.440
It wasn’t until the 17th and 18th centuries
that certified anatomists were allowed to

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.260
perform tightly regulated human dissections
-- and they were so popular that they were

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:17.600
often public events, with admission fees,
attended by the likes of Michelangelo and Rembrandt

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:22.160
The study of human anatomy became such a craze
in Europe that grave-robbing became a lucrative,

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:27.740
if not legal, occupation … until 1832, when
Britain passed the Anatomy Act, which provided

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:32.050
students with plentiful corpses, in the form
of executed murderers.

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:36.340
Today, students of anatomy and physiology
still use educational cadavers to learn, in

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.720
person and hands-on, what’s inside a human
body by dissecting them.

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.090
And it’s totally legal. The cadavers are
volunteers -- which is what people mean when

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.170
they say they’re “donating their body
to science.”

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.030
So what have all of these dead bodies shown
us?

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.440
Well, one big idea we see over and over is
that the function of a cell or an organ or

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.990
a whole organism always reflects its form.

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:59.130
Blood flows in one direction through your
heart simply because its valves prevent it

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:00.080
from flowing backward

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:04.510
In the same way, your your bones are strong
and hard and this allows them to protect and

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.060
support all your soft parts.

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:10.270
The basic idea -- that what a structure can
do depends on its specific form -- is called

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:13.290
the complementarity of structure and function.

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.570
And it holds true through every level of your
body’s organization, from cell to tissue

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:18.320
to system.

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.560
And it begins with the smallest of the small:
atoms.

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:26.040
Just like the chair you’re sitting on, you are
just a conglomeration of atoms -- about 7

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.720
octillion of them, to be precise.

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.290
Fortunately for both of us here, we've covered
the basics of chemistry that every incoming

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:35.310
physiology student needs to know, in Crash
Course Chemistry. So I’ll  be referring

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:38.880
you there throughout the course, when it comes
to how things work at the atomic level.

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.600
But the next level up from the chemistry of
atoms and molecules includes the smallest

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.840
units of living things -- cells.

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:50.130
All cells have some basic functions in common,
but they also vary widely in size and shape,

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:51.010
depending on their purpose.

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:54.720
For example! One of the smallest cells in
your body is the red blood cell, which measures

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:59.350
about 5 micrometers across. Now contrast that
with the single motor neuron that runs the

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:05.280
length of your entire leg, from your big toe
to the bottom of your spine, about a meter

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.340
from end to end.
Typically, cells group with similar cells

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:13.780
to form the next level of organization: tissues,
like muscles, membranes and cavity linings,

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:17.550
nervous, and connective tissues.
When two or more tissue types combine, they

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:23.090
form organs -- the heart, liver, lungs, skin
and etcetera that perform specific functions

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:25.270
to keep the body running.

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:30.010
Organs work together and combine to get things
done, forming organ systems. It’s how, like,

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:34.740
the liver, stomach, and intestines of your
digestive system all unite to take that burrito

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:36.260
from plate to pooper.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:40.639
And finally, all those previous levels combine
to form the highest level of organization

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:41.800
-- the body itself.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:47.380
Me and you and your dog -- we’re all glorious
complete organisms, made from the precise

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:51.230
organization of trillions of cells in nearly
constant activity.

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:55.600
This ability of all living systems to maintain
stable, internal conditions no matter what

00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:00.330
changes are occurring outside the body is
called homeostasis, and it’s another major

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:02.860
unifying theme in anatomy and physiology.

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:07.030
Your survival is all about maintaining balance
-- of both materials and energy.

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:12.169
For example, you need the right amount of
blood, water, nutrients, and oxygen to create

00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:16.750
and disperse energy, as well as the perfect
body temperature, the right blood pressure,

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:20.919
and efficient movement of waste through your
body, all that needs to stay balanced.

00:06:20.919 --> 00:06:25.380
And by your survival depending on it? I mean
that everyone’s ultimate cause of death

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:29.270
is the extreme and irreversible loss of homeostasis.

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:34.699
Organ failure, hypothermia, suffocation, starvation,
dehydration -- they all lead to the same end,

00:06:34.699 --> 00:06:38.940
by throwing off your internal balances that
allow your body to keep processing energy.

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:45.410
Take an extreme and sudden case -- your arm
pops off. If nothing is done quickly to treat

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:47.389
such a severe wound, you would bleed to death,
right?

00:06:47.389 --> 00:06:50.840
But … what does that really mean? What's
gonna happen? How do I die?

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:55.370
Well, that arterial wound, if left untreated,
will cause a drastic drop in blood pressure

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:58.639
that, in turn, will prevent the delivery of
oxygen throughout the body.

00:06:58.639 --> 00:07:03.540
So the real result of such an injury -- the
actual cause of death -- is the loss of homeostasis.

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:07.790
I mean, you can live a full and healthy life
without an arm. But you can’t live without

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:11.830
blood pressure, because without blood, your
cells don’t get oxygen, and without oxygen,

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:13.949
they can’t process energy, and you die.

00:07:13.949 --> 00:07:17.610
With so many connected parts needed to make
your life possible, you can see how we need

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:22.900
a hyper-precise language to identify the parts
of your body and communicate what’s happening to them

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:26.780
A doctor isn't gonna recommend a patient for
surgery by telling the surgeon that the patient

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:27.750
has an “achey belly.”

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:31.800
They’re going to need to give a detailed
description -- essentially, it's like a verbal map

00:07:31.889 --> 00:07:36.590
So, over time, anatomy has developed its own
standardized set of directional terms that

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:39.970
described where one body part is in relation
to another.

00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:43.620
Imagine a person standing in front of you
-- this is what’s called the classic anatomical

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:47.990
position -- where the body is erect and facing
straight ahead, with arms at the sides and

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:49.020
palms forward.

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:54.340
Now imagine slicing that person into different
sections, or planes. Don't imagine it too

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:55.160
graphically though.

00:07:55.160 --> 00:08:00.310
The sagittal plane comes down vertically and
divides a body or organ in left and right

00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:01.210
parts.

00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:05.530
If you imagine a plane parallel to the sagittal
plane, but off to one side, that plane is

00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:06.600
the parasagittal.

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:11.460
The coronal, or frontal plane splits everything
vertically into front and back.

00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:15.509
And the transverse, or horizontal plane divides
the body top and bottom.

00:08:15.509 --> 00:08:19.259
Look at that body again and you’ll notice
more divisions, like the difference between

00:08:19.259 --> 00:08:22.139
the axial and appendicular parts.

00:08:22.139 --> 00:08:25.990
Everything in line with the center of the
body -- the head, neck, and trunk -- are considered

00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:31.600
axial parts, while the arms and legs -- or
appendages-- are the appendicular parts that

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:32.999
attach to the body’s axis.

00:08:32.999 --> 00:08:37.369
Everything at the front of your body is considered
anterior, or ventral, and everything in the back

00:08:37.369 --> 00:08:39.610
is posterior, or dorsal.

00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:44.809
So your eyes are anterior, and your butt is
posterior, but you’d also say that your breastbone

00:08:44.809 --> 00:08:50.769
is anterior to, or in front of, the spine,
and that the heart is posterior to, or behind

00:08:50.769 --> 00:08:51.519
the breastbone.

00:08:51.519 --> 00:08:55.829
Features toward the top of your body, like
your head, are considered superior, or cranial,

00:08:55.829 --> 00:08:59.740
while structures that are lower down are inferior,
or caudal.

00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:04.360
So the jaw is superior to the lungs because
it’s above them, while the pelvis is inferior

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:06.480
to the stomach because it’s below it.

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:10.730
And, there's more: if you imagine that center
line running down the axis of a body, structures

00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:15.959
toward that midline are called medial, while
those farther away from the midline are lateral.

00:09:15.959 --> 00:09:19.790
So the arms are lateral to the heart, and
the heart is medial to the arms.

00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:22.990
Looking at the limbs -- your appendicular
parts of your body -- you’d call the areas

00:09:22.990 --> 00:09:27.199
closer to the center of the trunk proximal,
and those farther away distal.

00:09:27.199 --> 00:09:31.399
In anatomy-talk, your knee is proximal to
your ankle because it’s closer to the axial

00:09:31.399 --> 00:09:36.059
line, while a wrist is distal to the elbow
because it’s farther from the center.

00:09:36.059 --> 00:09:37.480
Okay, so pop quiz!

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:42.670
I’m eating a club sandwich -- I'm not, I
wish I was, but imagine I am. I’m so ravenous

00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:46.920
and distracted that I forget to take out that
little frilly toothpick at the top, and I

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:50.240
end up swallowing it with a raft of turkey,
bacon, and toast.

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:55.589
A fragment of the toothpick gets lodged somewhere
in here, and my doctor takes an x-ray, and

00:09:55.589 --> 00:09:56.629
says I need surgery.

00:09:56.629 --> 00:10:01.900
Using anatomical language, how would she direct
the surgeon to that tiny wooden stake inside of me?

00:10:01.959 --> 00:10:06.749
She might describe it as being “along the
medial line, posterior to the heart, but anterior

00:10:06.749 --> 00:10:10.610
to the vertebrae, inferior to the collarbone,
but superior to the stomach.”

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:14.179
That would give the surgeon a pretty good
idea of where to look -- in the esophagus,

00:10:14.179 --> 00:10:17.470
just above to the stomach! I warned you at
the beginning: Lots of terms!

00:10:17.470 --> 00:10:21.899
But all those terms might have just saved
my life. And it’s the end of your first

00:10:21.899 --> 00:10:24.079
lesson, and you’ve already started to talk
the talk.

00:10:24.079 --> 00:10:27.829
Today you learned that anatomy studies the
structure of body parts, while physiology

00:10:27.829 --> 00:10:31.550
describes how those parts come together to
function. We also talked about some of these

00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:35.829
disciplines’ central principles, including
the complementarity of structure and function,

00:10:35.829 --> 00:10:40.579
the hierarchy of organization, and how the
balance of materials and energy known as homeostasis

00:10:40.579 --> 00:10:45.489
