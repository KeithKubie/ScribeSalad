00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.160
For centuries, humans have been using substances
to alter their state of mind.

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.500
From caffeine, cigarettes and alcohol
to more extreme drugs.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.760
But as the most commonly used
illicit drug in North America,

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:12.560
Where does marijuana fit in

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:14.760
and how exactly does it affect your brain?

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.480
First, we need to understand how the brain functions.

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.560
Neurons are the cells that
process information in the brain.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.320
By releasing chemicals called neurotransmitters

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.980
from the axon of one neuron
to the dendrite of another

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.720
they change the electrical charge
of the receiving neuron

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.820
consequently exciting or inhibiting it.

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:32.820
If excited, the signal is passed on.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.660
Though it sounds simple
these signals work together

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.360
and the effect is quickly compouned
into complex configurations within milliseconds

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.240
flashing over the entire brain.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.140
This is what happens every single time
you think, breathe or move.

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.920
So what is going on inside your brain
when you’re smoking marijuana?

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.780
Well unlike alcohol, which contains molecules
nothing like those in our body,

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.840
cannabis contains molecules that resemble those
produced in our very own brains:

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.500
cannabonoids.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.860
Although naturally these cannabonoids
circulate at much lower quantities

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.280
compared to the large influx imposed by smoking,

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.900
specifically the chemical tetrahydrocannabinol

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.140
or THC

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.220
resembles a natural transmitter called  “anandamide”.

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.140
These cannabonoids are specialized neurotransmitters

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.340
released by neurons having just fired.

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.020
Neurons temporarily become unresponsive after firing

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.180
to prevent them from overracting
or being too dominant.

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.220
This allows your brain to function in a
calm and controlled manner.

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.880
But cannabonoids interrupt this approach
in some parts of the brain.

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.280
Instead, they remove the refractory period of neurons
that are already active

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.460
and can cause your thoughts, imagination,
and perception to utterly magnify itself.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.620
This means, once you begin your train of thought

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:42.480
it becomes the most significant
and profound thing ever.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.700
You can’t see the big picture
or even recall your last epiphany

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.700
because you’re caught up in the momentum
of a particular idea

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.700
and your neurons keep firing

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.980
until a new idea takes hold
and you go off on a new tangent.

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:57.980
These cannabonoids also affect the levels
of dopamine and norepinephrine in your brain

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:01.740
often leading to a sense of euphoria,
relaxation, pain modulation

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.740
and general enhancement of an experience,

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.900
though sometimes causing anxiety.

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.980
Furthermore, there are cannabonoid receptors

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:12.420
in areas controlling short-term memory,
learning, coordination, movement control

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.420
and higher cognitive functions.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.680
