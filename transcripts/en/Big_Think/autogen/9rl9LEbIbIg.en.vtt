00:03:58.189 --> 00:03:58.199
contribution by coming up with a
 

00:03:58.199 --> 00:04:01.399
contribution by coming up with a
genuinely new idea tackle the problem in

00:04:01.399 --> 00:04:01.409
genuinely new idea tackle the problem in
 

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:03.740
genuinely new idea tackle the problem in
a completely different way then this

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750
a completely different way then this
 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.129
a completely different way then this
could be what we have really waited a

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:07.139
could be what we have really waited a
 

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:08.839
could be what we have really waited a
long time for which is that big

00:04:08.839 --> 00:04:08.849
long time for which is that big
 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:10.759
long time for which is that big
breakthrough that is going to maybe half

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769
breakthrough that is going to maybe half
 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:12.770
breakthrough that is going to maybe half
that mortality rate that's that's my

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780
that mortality rate that's that's my
 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.930
that mortality rate that's that's my
ambition
