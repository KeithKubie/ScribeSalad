Hi, YouTube. I'm in Davos and the convention
of wisdom here is that to cope with the financial

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:12.490
crisis we have to restore confidence. And
I think that in order to restore confidence

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:18.740
it is-it is about leadership-political leadership
and business leadership. It is about the bankers

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:24.810
and business leaders who have been involved
in the financial crisis to just simply take

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.119
responsibility and say that mistakes have
been done even in good faith.

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:35.980
It is for politicians not to be taking by
temptation shortcuts or easy measures that

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:41.030
will be that are going to be unsustainable
in the long term like excessive spending-public

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:46.909
spending or protectionist measures.
Without this kind of leadership I think there

00:00:46.909 --> 00:00:58.299
is a risk that forces of populism or extreme
west or-um-no-left or right ideologies could

00:00:58.299 --> 00:01:04.210
further disharmonize our demo-democracy, and-and
even delay the solutions and implementations

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.640
of the measures that will need to be taken.
Thank you very much.
