1
00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:05.490
The Joe Rogan experience,
you know?
Yeah.

2
00:00:05.491 --> 00:00:08.970
That fight was a very unexpected,

3
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.290
the way Paul deal decided to take him down.
I was like,
I was pretty stunned.
Yeah.

4
00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:15.480
I didn't think we were going to see that.
Let me Paul Daley.

5
00:00:15.481 --> 00:00:17.100
So dangerous is fucking left.

6
00:00:17.101 --> 00:00:21.480
Hook is one of the best in all of the business left hand period.
Anyway,

7
00:00:21.481 --> 00:00:24.780
throws it.
Both of them knew what they were going up against,
so like Yup.

8
00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.620
Even behind the shit talk they do like,
yeah.

9
00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.760
It was a tough fight for both of them.
It was,

10
00:00:29.761 --> 00:00:34.761
but it was interesting to me watching page use is distance and that crazy karate

11
00:00:35.581 --> 00:00:39.960
point style and that,
you know,
he had to,

12
00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:42.660
he had a really look out for that stuff.

13
00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.840
I mean he had a head of make sure that he wasn't getting dinged by that stuff.

14
00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.890
Yeah.
When he's coming in with like his venom throws all this wild stuff,

15
00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:55.060
like almost like a fencer like dives in on you and pops you and you could tell

16
00:00:55.771 --> 00:01:00.540
Paul Daley was like really having a hard time,
like finding that range.
Yeah.

17
00:01:00.541 --> 00:01:02.850
It's,
it's harder to,

18
00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.170
to fight against guys that are long and know how to use your body like

19
00:01:07.171 --> 00:01:10.320
athletically.
Is He fighting Douglas Lema?
Next is.

20
00:01:10.321 --> 00:01:12.030
That's what's happening over in Beltour.

21
00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.220
I remember seeing that Douglas Lema had a fight,

22
00:01:14.221 --> 00:01:17.610
but I don't remember who the opponent was.
Who's Michael Van and Paige fighting.

23
00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.510
Find out that he's a spectacular though,
man.
Right.

24
00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.840
He that he landed on Cyborg was holy shit.
He caved the man's head end goal.

25
00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.260
We've never seen that.
I've never seen Fraser.
Just insane.

26
00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.310
Like you got hit with a media.
Imagine the pain.
Imagine man.

27
00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.010
And he was hanging up.
The headaches are bad like four months.
He's like,

28
00:01:35.011 --> 00:01:38.610
I'll be fighting,
getting four months.
And they were like,
Bro.
Yeah,

29
00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.840
I met that guy in Brazil.
It's tough,
man.
Yeah,
he's tough.
He's been around me.

30
00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.080
That's why when you see a guy like that cover his face and then fall down like

31
00:01:46.081 --> 00:01:49.680
that.
Oh,
it is Chandler versus pitbull.
Uh,

32
00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.380
Lima versus MVP.
That's it.
Tagless Lima's no,
jail.
11th.

33
00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.370
He's no joke.
That's a dangerous man.
Lima,
the Opportunity Ed.

34
00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.640
He's a fucking enormous welterweight to Lima is easy.

35
00:02:02.641 --> 00:02:07.641
I've never seen him in first is a big frame for one seven woo cuts a lot of

36
00:02:07.891 --> 00:02:11.940
weight.
But he's so powerful when he gets in there.
Dangerous fucking striker.

37
00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.330
Lemas he's for real.
That to me is as interesting if not more interesting.

38
00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.570
The Paul daily fight.
I want to see what happens.
Yeah.

39
00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:22.950
His Lima is a little different.
Like he's not,
he's not gonna trash talk a lot.

40
00:02:22.951 --> 00:02:25.890
Like he knows he's dangerous guide.
Yeah.
So there's Michael.

41
00:02:25.891 --> 00:02:28.290
It's going to be a good one.
That's a real good one for sure.
Yeah.

42
00:02:28.291 --> 00:02:32.070
Well fights like that really legitimize belter because these are fights that

43
00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.450
they could be easily be a main event in the UFC.
Yeah.
Talent wise,
you know,

44
00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.980
unquestionably that fight.
Whew.
Then and Paige is,

45
00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:45.420
he's a real fucking hard pill to swallow,
man.
Figure that guy out.

46
00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.360
Who the fuck can you bring in a train that can move like him?

47
00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.070
No one you can try but you're not,
he doesn't even know how he's going to move.

48
00:02:53.071 --> 00:02:57.810
You know?
I think that guy just puts out music and just whatever happens,
happens.

49
00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:58.051
Yeah.

50
00:02:58.051 --> 00:03:02.020
That's why this fight is so interesting because Lima is like way more like a,

51
00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.100
has a,
just a rock solid traditional stance,
you know,

52
00:03:06.101 --> 00:03:09.910
he moves real well.
Devastating power.

53
00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.420
That's going to be a really good fight.
Where does Lima trade,
do you know?

54
00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.880
It's a good question.
Where's Douglas Lema train?
Um,

55
00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.920
Jamie's going to find that out for us.
Yeah.
Yeah.

56
00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.560
I'm very happy that there's a bunch of good organizations like,

57
00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.800
like one and you know like the Pfl now and Bella Tor.

58
00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:31.380
It's great that fighters have options.
Super good.
Yeah,
just it

59
00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.940
a lot of times too.
Like I like to just watch whatever's going on.

60
00:03:36.941 --> 00:03:39.790
You never know who you're going to come across.
Where is that?

61
00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:45.190
Where is that American top tapes somewhere.
Is it?
It's terrifying.

62
00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.670
Nasty combinations,
man.

63
00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:53.230
He's got ruthless leg kicks to man att where?

64
00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.580
Which one?
There's a bunch of those.
Right?
On top teams.

65
00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:03.240
You might be Att Florida,
I dunno.
Is He didn't look like the Florida law,

66
00:04:03.241 --> 00:04:07.000
but a t.
T how many atts are there?

67
00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:08.470
I have no idea.

68
00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:13.510
Is there a bunch I should know that I think I've only heard of training two or

69
00:04:13.511 --> 00:04:16.960
three.
Who?
Cat Fight Club?
I guess Thailand.
Oh,

71
00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.070
Bootcamp fight club.
Maybe saw your fight.
It's like,

72
00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:28.970
I'm going to Thailand to bring everybody.
Everybody come.
