00:00:03.161 --> 00:00:04.536
DAVID KOPF: Starting
your company

00:00:04.536 --> 00:00:06.656
is kind of like riding
a bike in San Francisco.

00:00:06.656 --> 00:00:09.030
You're going up this hill,
and you're looking at the top,

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:10.740
and then you get to it,
and you feel good you've

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.000
accomplished whatever goal.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.080
But a second later, then
you catch your breath,

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:15.960
and you look up, and
you realize, oh, there's

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.155
another hill to go.

00:00:17.155 --> 00:00:19.985
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:19.985 --> 00:00:21.360
BRETT KOPF: I like
to tell people

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.359
that I started the company
in fifth grade, which

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:24.600
is a total lie.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.670
But the why behind
it is true, because I

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.990
was diagnosed with a bunch
of learning disabilities.

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:31.740
I spent years
struggling in schools.

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.894
In high school in Chicago,
I had this teacher

00:00:33.894 --> 00:00:36.060
named Ms. Whitefield, and
she was just very patient,

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:36.709
and she cared.

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:39.000
She would spend a bunch of
time with me if I needed it.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.280
And her and my mom would
literally talk every week.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.537
Now, at the time,
Remind didn't exist.

00:00:43.537 --> 00:00:44.370
MS. WHITEFIELD: Hey!

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.270
BRETT KOPF: Ms. Whitefield!

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:45.720
How's it going?

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:46.840
MS. WHITEFIELD: It's
so great to see you!

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:47.330
BRETT KOPF: You too!

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:48.371
I know it's been forever!

00:00:48.371 --> 00:00:48.895
[INAUDIBLE]

00:00:48.895 --> 00:00:49.770
MS. WHITEFIELD: Yeah.

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.478
BRETT KOPF: I thought
to myself that if I

00:00:51.478 --> 00:00:54.060
can give the Ms. Whitefields
of the world superpowers

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.970
and make them more efficient,
it could have an enormous impact

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:58.530
on the education system.

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.750
Remind is an application
that makes it incredibly

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.960
easy for teachers to communicate
with students and parents

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.556
over any device.

00:01:05.556 --> 00:01:06.930
So I would spend
my time speaking

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.200
to hundreds of teachers
across the country

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.790
while David was locked in a
room learning how to code.

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.290
DAVID KOPF: Learning to
code was one of the hardest

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.130
things I ever did.

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.660
And we were two
kids from Chicago.

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:17.993
We didn't know the first thing
about starting a company,

00:01:17.993 --> 00:01:20.790
but we embarked on this
journey that is now Remind.

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.270
BRETT KOPF: Our parents and
some of our closest friends

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.100
supported us financially.

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.040
SPEAKER 1: I was happy
that the two of you

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.770
were together doing something
that you were both passionate

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:32.270
about.

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.269
DAVID KOPF: We would talk
to all these teachers.

00:01:34.269 --> 00:01:36.090
And when I saw that
enthusiasm from them,

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.730
I was like, oh, wow, maybe
we're onto something.

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:41.310
BRETT KOPF: We decided to
move to Silicon Valley.

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.190
Before long, some incredibly
well-known investors

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:46.560
started to invest
in the company.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.050
It was validating,
because people were seeing

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.470
value in what we were building.

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.100
TINA LEMIRE: Kids
forget everything,

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.650
and so it's just
a way for me to be

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.650
able to communicate and
connect with my students

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:59.733
and their families, and
make sure that everybody's

00:01:59.733 --> 00:02:00.540
on the same page.

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.330
Yesterday, we went through,
and we did the translation.

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.280
One of the great
stories is involving

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.820
one of my students, Jason.

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.259
He struggled, especially with
turning things in on time.

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.330
One day, he came to me.

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.070
JASON MURRAY: Then I
was like, I bet you

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:16.710
that if I do all my
work and pass the test,

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:17.850
you'll throw us a party.

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:19.850
TINA LEMIRE: When the
other kids heard about it,

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:21.745
they would communicate
using Remind.

00:02:21.745 --> 00:02:23.370
JASON MURRAY: I kept
receiving messages

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.710
from Ms. Lemire and
my other classmates

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:26.985
to help me and motivate me.

00:02:26.985 --> 00:02:28.360
TINA LEMIRE: As
a result, I lost.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.440
They got to have
an ice cream party.

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.510
Remind has helped me to
motivate students like Jason.

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.900
JASON MURRAY: My grades were
similar to some of Ms. Lemire's

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:37.740
honors students.

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.490
And it just shows that
you can do anything

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:42.050
if you put your mind to it.

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:43.640
BRETT KOPF: By
far, the best thing

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.100
about starting and
scaling a company for me

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.839
was providing value
and helping people.

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:50.630
The cool thing about
technology is that you

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.640
can build it once and scale it.

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.040
With Google Play, we've
been able to reach millions

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.820
of users we would have
never been able to reach

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.150
if that platform did not exist.

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.940
We currently have over 23
million active teachers,

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.110
students, and parents in
over 90% of US K-12 school

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:07.490
districts.

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:11.570
We believe that the best way to
improve the education system is

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:14.910
to help create and build
relationships between teachers,

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:16.100
students, and parents.

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.247
And being the company
that facilitates that--

00:03:19.247 --> 00:03:20.330
there's no better feeling.

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:23.680
