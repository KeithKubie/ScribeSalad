00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
The question is what is the largest-sized index where we can do a lookup in about 1 second?

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
If you look at the executions we have, we've seen the time it takes

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
with an index with 10,000 is 0.0009 seconds.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
The time with an index of 100,000 is 0.0085 seconds.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Your goal is to predict what the largest index that can support

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
lookups that finish within about 1 second is.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Your choices are 200,000 keywords, 1 million keywords, 10 million keywords,

00:00:32.000 --> 99:59:59.000
100 million keywords, or 1 billion keywords.
