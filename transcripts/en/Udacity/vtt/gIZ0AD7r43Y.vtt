Wow, we've discussed a lot of stuff here. We know what the slope looks like,

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.774
it's the steepness. We know what it means for slope to be positive, negative,

00:00:07.774 --> 00:00:11.762
zero, or even undefined. We can calculate the slope between two points using a

00:00:11.762 --> 00:00:15.602
fancy equation, and we've learned how to read an equation in slope intercept

00:00:15.602 --> 00:00:20.573
form, and a little bit in standard form. That's a ton of material. I know that

00:00:20.573 --> 00:00:30.713
we've covered a lot, so you make sure you take some time to practice these

00:00:30.713 --> 00:00:37.204
skills, and then come back when youre ready.
