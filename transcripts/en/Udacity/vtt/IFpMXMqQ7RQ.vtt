00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:01.180
&gt;&gt; All right, take me through.

00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:03.760
&gt;&gt; Okay. So, the first thing I want to say

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:05.900
is, I think it's awesome that you made me do

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:07.990
this quiz. The second thing I want to say is,

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:10.660
in some sense, every single one of them is correct.

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:11.880
&gt;&gt; Yay!

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.810
&gt;&gt; But, you put radio buttons down, not check

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:17.430
box buttons, thingys, so I have to pick one. So

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.260
let's just go through. Figure out the best line

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:25.370
to wait in. Well, that is a queue, queue which

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:29.110
would make a lot of sense if I were, say, English.

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:31.640
&gt;&gt; Yes, that's right. In fact, you are, in this picture.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.590
&gt;&gt; Oh yeah, great. [LAUGH]

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.260
That's the English version of Charles, the one with the top hat. Okay.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:39.280
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and a cane, too.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.300
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I like it. And a cane, yes, well

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.660
that is typically what I do whenever I go to

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.520
London. Discovering when to come in for your line, that

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:50.400
is also a queue-learning though a different kind of queue. que-learning.

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.030
The third practicing your best bank shot,

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:56.900
although I probably would've said break shot.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.520
&gt;&gt; Ooh, nice.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.230
&gt;&gt; That is also cue-learning.

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.920
&gt;&gt; And it's the same spelling.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:03.410
&gt;&gt; That's the same spelling.

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:04.040
&gt;&gt; That's unfortunate.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.070
&gt;&gt; Well, you pronounce one cue, and you pronounce the other one cue.

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.750
&gt;&gt; Yes, well clearly. But, and I spelled them that way too.

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.500
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I know. I know. I can see where the emphasis is. And the

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.420
fourth one is evaluating the Bellman equations from

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.690
data. That is you take in the states,

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.520
the actions, rewards and the next states, and you try to

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.350
learn an actual Q function, which is just the letter Q.

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.570
So that is Q-learning, and is the only one that is

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.070
spelled correctly, and so that is the choice that I would make.

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.000
&gt;&gt; Alright, so, just to be clear here. So

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.930
this all [LAUGH] the purpose here other than to.

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.043
&gt;&gt; Demonstrate your ability to show puns?

00:01:38.043 --> 00:01:40.590
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Is that is just to

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.695
give the definition. So that, so what Q-learning

00:01:42.695 --> 00:01:45.545
is going to be doing is it's going to use transitions, that is

00:01:45.545 --> 00:01:48.940
to say data, to directly produce the solution to those Q equations.
