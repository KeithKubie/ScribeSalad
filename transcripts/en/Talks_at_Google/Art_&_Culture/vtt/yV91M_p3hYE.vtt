[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.916 --> 00:00:08.930
SPEAKER 1: So welcome to Google.

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:10.710
I'm so excited to have you here.

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.160
And for those of us
who have seen the film,

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:14.670
this is a really--

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.080
a remarkably fresh
and modern film.

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.275
It's a modern take on that
classic high school story.

00:00:21.275 --> 00:00:23.630
So I really want to
commend all of you

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.690
for putting together something
really relatable and yet

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:28.670
incredibly unique.

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:30.722
So we're really excited
to be chatting about it.

00:00:30.722 --> 00:00:32.180
I wanted to start
with you, Olivia.

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.030
I know that this is
your directorial debut.

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.790
This is a first film
that you have been

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:38.720
sitting in the director's seat.

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:39.315
Is that right?

00:00:39.315 --> 00:00:40.065
OLIVIA WILDE: Yes.

00:00:40.065 --> 00:00:40.565
True.

00:00:40.565 --> 00:00:44.565
SPEAKER 1: So I recognize that
this is somewhat of a cliche

00:00:44.565 --> 00:00:45.690
question to start out with.

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.485
But I think a lot of us who have
seen you on screen and in film

00:00:50.485 --> 00:00:52.610
were curious about what
that transition looked like

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:54.870
and how it felt actually
being in that director's seat.

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:55.990
So could you tell us
a little bit about it?

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:57.227
OLIVIA WILDE: Yes.

00:00:57.227 --> 00:00:58.560
First of all, this is very cool.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:59.310
We're freaking out.

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:00.390
We're very, very excited.

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.170
Thank you so much for coming.

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:04.170
It's really interesting.

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.790
I think the film industry is
unique in its kind of fluidity

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:09.560
within the roles
of the industry.

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.090
You are allowed and in
some ways encouraged

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.950
to take on different roles, from
actor to producer to director.

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:20.750
And I think that's
something that's

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.910
kind of great about the
way the industry works.

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:24.830
Where there is a
will, there is a way.

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.430
You are able to kind of move
fluidly between those roles.

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.160
So I'd been producing
for several years.

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.860
And I'd directed short
films and music videos

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.630
and really learned
a lot doing that.

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.860
But when I really wanted to
leap into the feature space

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:45.080
as a director, I found
that the barriers

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.910
weren't impossible to overcome.

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:49.730
They were challenging.

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:52.520
It is a matter of
proving oneself as--

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.920
stepping out of
what people know you

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.870
as, even within the industry.

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:58.910
But I was kind of really
pleasantly surprised

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:01.680
by the willingness to accept
the idea, the concept of hey,

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.160
I'm actually going to take the
reins and be in charge now.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.270
And particularly
from the actors,

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.720
it's really an honor when
actors, fellow actors,

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.200
agree to be in your film
and to allow themselves

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.620
to be directed by you.

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.030
It's a really amazing
experience and to say, listen,

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:21.110
I speak your language.

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:22.940
I respect what you do.

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.930
I can empathize completely.

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.710
And now, I want to work with
you in this different way.

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:28.850
I want to take charge.

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:30.690
Will you go on this
journey with me?

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.040
So I was just kind of
overwhelmed with gratitude

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.778
at every moment.

00:02:34.778 --> 00:02:36.320
I was like, I can't
believe everybody

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.700
is gathering for me to tell this
weird story that's in my head.

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.850
And some of the particularly
weird moments that I was--

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:45.782
like when I asked them
to do a stop motion

00:02:45.782 --> 00:02:47.240
Barbie sequence
where they would be

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.970
miniaturized into Barbies after
they take drugs by accident.

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.338
And everybody was like,
yeah great, no problem,

00:02:53.338 --> 00:02:54.380
going to love doing that.

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:59.180
So I will say, the transition
was really exciting.

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.790
It took me a long time to
build that courage, though.

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:02.720
I'm 35.

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.210
I've been wanting to
direct since I was 23,

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:06.830
so it took some time.

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:09.350
I started doing shorts when
I was like 26 and then music

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:10.100
videos from there.

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:11.860
But I'm really, really
happy to be here.

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.360
And now, I'm hooked, and it's
all I ever want to do forever.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:15.040
SPEAKER 1: That's amazing.

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.635
Yeah, 35.

00:03:15.635 --> 00:03:16.760
Super unaccomplished at 35.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.880
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.630
Making all of us in
our 30s feel bad.

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:21.710
No, that's great.

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:25.010
So for all of you
actually, what was it

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:27.330
that drew you to this project?

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.440
I know, Katie, you did a
lot of work in the writing

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.663
and producing and helping
to shape some of the story.

00:03:33.663 --> 00:03:35.330
And for each of you
who are in the film,

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:36.950
I don't want to
do a round robin.

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.117
But for anyone who would
like to answer, what was it

00:03:39.117 --> 00:03:41.705
about this film
that drew you in?

00:03:41.705 --> 00:03:43.080
KATIE SILBERMAN:
I think for me--

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:44.520
just because I got
to join first--

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.000
well, besides
Kaitlyn, actually--

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.580
it was the opportunity to tell
the kind of generational anthem

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:53.330
that Olivia was excited
to tell, like when

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:55.622
we talked about our favorite
movies and the movies that

00:03:55.622 --> 00:03:57.260
made us want to make movies.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.870
It was stuff like "Fast Times
at Ridgemont High" and "Dazed

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:02.930
and Confused" and "Clueless" and
"Mean Girls" and these movies

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.360
that not only were funny
enough and joyful enough

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.400
that you could re-watch
them all the time,

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.060
but that also were very timely
in terms of the generation they

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:11.815
depicted.

00:04:11.815 --> 00:04:13.190
They're so specific
about what it

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:15.570
was like to be a
teenager at that time,

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:17.480
and at the same
time, really timeless

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.010
in just telling
wonderful stories

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:22.130
about what it's like to be
young and friends and in love.

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:24.620
And so I have always wanted
to make a high school

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.600
movie like that, because I
think everyone's emotions are so

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:28.100
heightened.

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.225
Everyone's selves are so
heightened in high school.

00:04:30.225 --> 00:04:32.210
And it's a really
wonderful opportunity

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:34.370
to tell a story that's
so concentrated that way.

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:35.995
But I would also say,
the biggest thing

00:04:35.995 --> 00:04:38.855
was wanting to work with
Olivia in hearing her vision.

00:04:38.855 --> 00:04:41.630
Hi.

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:47.150
She had such a clear vision,
a contagiously exciting vision

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:49.165
and tone for the movie
she was going to make.

00:04:49.165 --> 00:04:51.290
And I've said before, I
wanted to watch that movie,

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:52.620
let alone be a part of it.

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.160
And so getting to speak to
her about what she was going

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.827
to do and see immediately how
extraordinary it was going

00:04:57.827 --> 00:05:00.410
to be and how talented she was
and how fun it was going to be,

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:02.660
that was probably the
biggest motivator.

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:04.090
SPEAKER 1: Well, it really is.

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:06.280
It's such a unique take
on the high school story.

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.650
And so for Kaitlyn, for
Beanie, for both of you being

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:12.280
in the space, there were--

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.113
and actually for
the entire group,

00:05:14.113 --> 00:05:16.280
there were so many moments
where you could recognize

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.117
that the film
could have slipped,

00:05:18.117 --> 00:05:20.450
if it had been a different
film, into some of the tropes

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:23.240
that we see just repeated and
repeated in high school films.

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.947
And it really managed to avoid
falling into those tropes

00:05:25.947 --> 00:05:26.780
over and over again.

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:31.110
So Kaitlyn, for your character,
Amy, to be in the space,

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:31.610
I think--

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:33.068
this is a slightly
selfish question

00:05:33.068 --> 00:05:35.580
and for our LGBTQ
folks in the audience--

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:38.630
but I was not out in high
school, and coming out

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:40.310
was a much more
challenging process.

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:42.410
And I think there was a
lot of self-justification

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:45.470
that a lot of us need to
do to exist in the world

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:49.530
and be normal members
of broader society.

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:52.490
And one of the incredibly
unique pieces of this film,

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:56.170
very personally, was that
the fact that Amy was queer--

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:58.670
I don't know how Amy
identified, but identified

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:01.010
as queer of some stripe--

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:02.240
was a non-issue.

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.430
It did not inspire struggle.

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:06.680
It was not something that
other people struggled with.

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:08.513
It wasn't a point of
contention in the film.

00:06:08.513 --> 00:06:10.490
It was just simply a
piece of her identity,

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:12.480
and that was so refreshing
for a lot of us.

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:15.710
So I'm curious, is
that a reflection

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:19.310
of where you see a
younger generation moving?

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:21.590
And do you think that
that is something

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:24.183
that was a good reflection
of high school in general

00:06:24.183 --> 00:06:26.600
at the moment, since it's been
a few years for some of us?

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:27.975
KAITLYN DEVER: I
feel like, well,

00:06:27.975 --> 00:06:30.470
the thing about '"Booksmart"--

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:33.410
the one thing that
attracted me to this script

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:38.120
when I first read it was Amy
and how much I would have--

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:41.450
when I first read her, I'm like,
oh my god, I have to play her.

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:44.150
And I think "Booksmart"
does so beautifully

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:48.830
represent the generation that
I am currently living in.

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:53.510
I think that I feel so honored
to play a girl like Amy,

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:56.960
and I feel like it's so
beautiful that it wouldn't

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:58.340
be in her character bio.

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:03.410
It wouldn't say,
Amy, 18, is queer.

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:05.520
It wouldn't say that.

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:09.957
I think in the beginning
stages of developing her,

00:07:09.957 --> 00:07:12.290
I don't even think we really
talked about it, because we

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:14.170
didn't want to make it a thing.

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:19.100
In coming-of-age movies, you
do see the coming out scene,

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:20.030
normally.

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:21.980
And I love how it just--

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:23.360
we don't need that in the movie.

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:27.728
Actually, the coming out scene
is when Molly's character

00:07:27.728 --> 00:07:28.520
is telling me she--

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:28.970
BEANIE FELDSTEIN: Crushing
on this one back here.

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:32.160
KAITLYN DEVER: Crushing
on the jock of the movie.

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.070
And I just think
it's so beautiful,

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:36.110
and I feel so honored
to be able to play her.

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:38.780
BEANIE FELDSTEIN: I also
love that the film depicts

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:42.500
a platonic but deeply, deeply
loving relationship between two

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:46.670
women that is so
beautiful and unique

00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:48.860
and celebrated in its beauty.

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:51.410
But then one of the
characters happens to be queer

00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:55.025
and how that love is never--

00:07:55.025 --> 00:07:56.900
it's just, it's celebrated
in a different way

00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:57.980
than romantic love.

00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:00.590
And I love that our film
gives that treatment

00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:04.170
to a friendship that involves
one heterosexual girl and one

00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:04.670
queer girl.

00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:06.680
And I just feel like
I've never really seen

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:08.222
that much of that,
especially in such

00:08:08.222 --> 00:08:10.375
a young space like high school.

00:08:10.375 --> 00:08:12.000
And I was really
moved by that as well.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.710
SPEAKER 1: You took the next
question right out of my mouth.

00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:14.210
I love that.

00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:15.320
She's psychic.

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:18.950
So on that note, for your
two characters, really--

00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:20.990
I mean, the bond
feels very genuine.

00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:23.210
Did you know each other
before coming into this film,

00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:24.200
or is that something
you developed

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:25.250
while you were making it?

00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:28.400
KAITLYN DEVER: Well, we realized
that we had passed each other

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:30.953
in the world, just
like we'd constantly

00:08:30.953 --> 00:08:32.870
been passing each other
but never actually got

00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:34.580
to have a full embrace.

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:36.872
BEANIE FELDSTEIN: That's the
girl from "Short Term 12".

00:08:36.872 --> 00:08:38.231
Oh my god, she's so talented.

00:08:38.231 --> 00:08:41.600
KAITLYN DEVER: And
then we finally met

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:44.530
when we both were finally
attached to "Booksmart."

00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:45.730
And we were like, eek.

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:51.350
We just met at lunch
one day, and we

00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:52.592
couldn't contain ourselves.

00:08:52.592 --> 00:08:54.800
And we were pretty much
holding hands the whole time,

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:56.300
like we were engaged.

00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:59.780
And it was instantaneous.

00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:02.120
It's so easy to love
Beanie Feldstein.

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:06.770
And then we were talking about
the movie, talking about prep.

00:09:06.770 --> 00:09:09.140
And then we still can't
figure it out, but one of us

00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:09.420
mentioned it.

00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:09.680
BEANIE FELDSTEIN: I
think it was Olivia.

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:10.670
KAITLYN DEVER: I
think it was Olivia.

00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:11.660
BEANIE FELDSTEIN: It was
the three of us at lunch.

00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:13.830
And Liv was like, I mean,
you could live together.

00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:16.790
And Kaitlyn and I were
like, can we do that?

00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:19.860
Is that allowed in the world?

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:22.670
But when you go on
location to film a movie,

00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:26.450
there's this inherent
bond that you get,

00:09:26.450 --> 00:09:28.190
because you don't
really know anyone

00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:29.600
else other than each other.

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:31.100
So you spend all
your time together.

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:33.050
But we were filming
the movie in LA.

00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:35.120
And Kaitlyn lives in
LA, and I'm from LA.

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:38.570
So we knew that it wouldn't be
the same as being tucked away

00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:40.820
in this small town where you
don't really know anyone.

00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:43.820
But we wanted to replicate
that experience, because it's

00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:47.450
so helpful and so
deeply meaningful

00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:52.460
when you just feel genuinely
comfortable and trusting

00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:54.200
and genuinely love
the person that you're

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:56.222
looking at all day, every day.

00:09:56.222 --> 00:09:57.680
And so living
together just gave us

00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:01.880
this beautiful, relaxed
foundation of a friendship,

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:04.850
so that when we layered
Molly and Amy on top of it,

00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:08.195
it felt so easy and so seamless.

00:10:08.195 --> 00:10:10.070
KAITLYN DEVER: It also
felt like we were just

00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:12.500
living in our own
world for two months,

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:17.150
because we'd go to work
from 6:00 PM to 6:00 AM,

00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:20.180
go home and sleep and then
have pancakes together, go over

00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:22.640
lines and then go back to work.

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:24.680
And we were just on
our own time zone,

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:28.350
and we were spending,
literally, 24/7 with each other.

00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:30.600
SPEAKER 1: That's pretty
intense after a little while.

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:33.980
So Mason, for you,
coming in again,

00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:37.610
I just come back to this idea
of not playing on these tropes.

00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:41.022
We had the good
looking, popular guy.

00:10:41.022 --> 00:10:42.980
But there are lots of
layers to that character.

00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:44.168
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:44.168 --> 00:10:45.710
MASON GOODING: I
mean, if you say so.

00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:46.620
SPEAKER 1: I mean, yeah.

00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:47.830
Queer girls can say that, too.

00:10:47.830 --> 00:10:47.930
It's cool.

00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:49.045
MASON GOODING: Of course.

00:10:49.045 --> 00:10:51.170
SPEAKER 1: So how was it
developing that character?

00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:55.100
And was the character of
Nick analogous in any way

00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:56.740
to your high school experience?

00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:58.640
MASON GOODING: So no.

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:04.520
I was probably the dorkiest you
could get in high school, which

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:08.150
is good because I feel like that
builds character and can allow

00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:10.790
you to see from
within and without.

00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:13.670
Nick is an
interesting character,

00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:16.280
because I love the way
it was written as--

00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:21.020
especially at first-- very
jock and stereotypical,

00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:25.010
in that sense, where he just
exudes cool and sort of pushes

00:11:25.010 --> 00:11:28.070
from within, like, oh, if
you're not quite in this circle,

00:11:28.070 --> 00:11:29.665
you maybe can't hang out.

00:11:29.665 --> 00:11:32.040
And as it speaks to the rest
of the people in this film--

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:34.010
I mean, Nico's a
phenomenal actor as well as

00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:35.480
being a great skater.

00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:38.060
Kaitlyn sings like you
wouldn't believe in addition

00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:40.010
to being a phenomenal actor.

00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:43.460
And Nick has this side
to him where just being--

00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:44.852
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:44.852 --> 00:11:47.340
BEANIE FELDSTEIN:
All right, Mason,

00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:48.440
remember our dance number?

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:50.960
MASON GOODING: I was going to
get to that if you would just

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:51.980
give me two seconds.

00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:57.480
That Beanie is a phenomenal--

00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:59.870
I mean, she's so good at
everything in addition to just

00:11:59.870 --> 00:12:01.470
being a phenomenal person.

00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:03.970
No, again, it all ties into
the fact that we're all--

00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:04.880
OLIVIA WILDE:
Let's all go around

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:06.620
and say what we love
about Beanie Feldstein.

00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:07.953
MASON GOODING: We might as well.

00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:15.920
He sort of brings people
in just to be excited

00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:20.240
and to be happy in themselves,
and it comes out even

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:24.500
in Molly's fantasy ideal of him,
that they're dancing together.

00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:27.500
And they can do this thing
where you can showcase Beanie's

00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:29.208
phenomenal dancing skills.

00:12:29.208 --> 00:12:30.500
OLIVIA WILDE: They are amazing.

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:32.180
MASON GOODING: They
really, really are.

00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:34.760
And it was just such a joy to
be able to bring that to light,

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:38.180
because everybody is someone
different on the inside

00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:40.850
than you might be able
to get from first glance.

00:12:40.850 --> 00:12:44.750
So it's really a good idea
to give people that time to--

00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:46.937
BEANIE FELDSTEIN: I love
the moment at the party.

00:12:46.937 --> 00:12:48.020
I love the dance sequence.

00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:50.718
And Mason had never
danced once in his life.

00:12:50.718 --> 00:12:51.635
Isn't that remarkable?

00:12:51.635 --> 00:12:53.540
MASON GOODING: Not once.

00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:55.490
BEANIE FELDSTEIN: And
also to be partnering,

00:12:55.490 --> 00:12:59.580
it takes so much
trust and dedication.

00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:00.950
And I was just in awe of him.

00:13:00.950 --> 00:13:01.720
MASON GOODING: You
make it so easy.

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:02.140
KAITLYN DEVER:
You're so incredible.

00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:03.310
BEANIE FELDSTEIN:
But I love the film.

00:13:03.310 --> 00:13:05.060
I love the moment in
the film at the party

00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:07.527
when you just see everything
Molly had projected onto Nick,

00:13:07.527 --> 00:13:10.110
like she's really mean about him
at the beginning of the film.

00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:12.710
She's like, oh god, why do
I have to deal with him?

00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:13.210
Why?

00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:13.710
Why?

00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:14.890
Why?

00:13:14.890 --> 00:13:16.640
Obviously, harboring
something underneath.

00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:18.770
But I think the
moment where he's just

00:13:18.770 --> 00:13:21.850
like, I can't believe Molly
showed up at the party.

00:13:21.850 --> 00:13:25.697
And I think what the film does
so beautifully is, it takes--

00:13:25.697 --> 00:13:27.530
specifically through
my character's judgment

00:13:27.530 --> 00:13:28.400
of people--

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:31.250
it takes that archetype that
you're projecting onto them

00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:32.990
and completely flips
it on its head.

00:13:32.990 --> 00:13:36.830
And I always say, the fact that
there's two smart girls, two,

00:13:36.830 --> 00:13:41.240
three, four, five cool skater
kids, two rich, party kids--

00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:43.310
the fact that there's
two of every archetype

00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:46.220
that we've set out for what
high school looks like,

00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:48.615
it inherently breaks
down that concept.

00:13:48.615 --> 00:13:50.240
And the ideology just
kind of crumbles.

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:52.120
Because if you have
more than one smart girl

00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:53.870
and they're interested
in different things

00:13:53.870 --> 00:13:55.790
and they're completely
different human beings,

00:13:55.790 --> 00:13:58.730
then the concept of what a
smart girl is ceases to exist.

00:13:58.730 --> 00:14:01.980
And it just becomes complicated,
multi-dimensional humans.

00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:04.790
And I think Nick is such a
beautiful example of that

00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:07.220
in the film, because she
projects so much judgment

00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:10.580
onto him and then, obviously,
is pleasantly surprised

00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:11.962
and then devastated.

00:14:11.962 --> 00:14:13.177
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:13.177 --> 00:14:15.260
SPEAKER 1: Nico, I would
say the same thing, also,

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:17.840
for your character,
Tanner, that, really, I

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:20.618
think through the film
you're searching for--

00:14:20.618 --> 00:14:22.160
and I hate that
we've been socialized

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:23.660
into doing this
when we watch films,

00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:26.580
but you're searching for
where to place that character.

00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:29.900
So what was it like for you
bringing that person to life,

00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:32.360
who was also deeply
multi-dimensional

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:36.050
and could have been the
offbeat, maybe artsy kid, also

00:14:36.050 --> 00:14:38.330
possibly a skater,
but also super smart

00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:42.275
and headed off to
Stanford in the fall.

00:14:42.275 --> 00:14:44.510
NICO HIRAGA: Tanner
was just basically

00:14:44.510 --> 00:14:46.940
the tie between
the skater group--

00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:50.060
Victoria, who played
Ryan, and the jock group,

00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:52.250
which is Eduardo and Mason.

00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:55.730
And he was just kind
of a lonely dude

00:14:55.730 --> 00:14:58.820
there, just kind of cruising
around on his four wheels,

00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:01.470
just going about.

00:15:01.470 --> 00:15:06.410
But he was just kind of like
the tie between the two groups.

00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:08.270
And it was really
cool to play Tanner,

00:15:08.270 --> 00:15:11.270
because I could relate
to a lot of the things--

00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:13.873
that I experienced in
high school at least--

00:15:13.873 --> 00:15:14.540
the same as him.

00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:15.332
It was rad.

00:15:15.332 --> 00:15:16.790
SPEAKER 1: Do you
want to share any

00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:19.610
of those high school experiences
that are analogous to Tanner?

00:15:22.988 --> 00:15:25.280
You don't have to-- didn't
mean to put you on the spot.

00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:26.730
MASON GOODING: PG
version, please.

00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:32.660
NICO HIRAGA: Academically,
he cared more about sports

00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:34.250
than he did in academics.

00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:37.640
And I'd say that was
true in high school.

00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:39.530
I did play soccer
in high school.

00:15:39.530 --> 00:15:43.310
And I didn't make it to
Stanford, but Tanner did.

00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:45.780
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:47.190
It's all good.

00:15:47.190 --> 00:15:49.130
SPEAKER 1: So this
film really feels

00:15:49.130 --> 00:15:50.840
like it comes together
pretty seamlessly,

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:53.660
and you've done something
really extraordinary by creating

00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:55.850
all of these multi-dimensional
characters that

00:15:55.850 --> 00:15:58.550
are in this particularly
stereotypical stage

00:15:58.550 --> 00:15:59.632
in their life.

00:15:59.632 --> 00:16:01.340
So what challenges
did you encounter when

00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:02.507
you were coming across this?

00:16:02.507 --> 00:16:04.190
I'd say, particularly,
Katie and Olivia,

00:16:04.190 --> 00:16:06.110
as you were going
through this process,

00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:09.050
there are thousands
upon thousands

00:16:09.050 --> 00:16:11.690
of scripts that are written
that could be easily followed.

00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:14.900
But taking it outside
of the box, I imagine,

00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:16.820
would sometimes be
difficult as you're

00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:17.930
trying to put those
characters together.

00:16:17.930 --> 00:16:19.070
So what was that
process like, and what

00:16:19.070 --> 00:16:20.270
challenges do you come across?

00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:21.853
OLIVIA WILDE: Well,
I mean, the reason

00:16:21.853 --> 00:16:24.680
that Katie was the ideal
screenwriter to come on board

00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:27.740
and reshape and re-imagine
this existing material

00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:31.790
was because she had these
incredibly specific and smart

00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:33.830
ideas of how to
expand each character

00:16:33.830 --> 00:16:36.890
and how to expand the
general narrative.

00:16:36.890 --> 00:16:39.080
I had pitched on
this movie because I

00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:44.300
loved the concept of two very
smart women who love each other

00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:47.240
and aren't trying to
assimilate to become

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:48.688
the cool kids or
the popular kids.

00:16:48.688 --> 00:16:49.730
They think they are cool.

00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:52.760
They're kind of gangster
about their intelligence,

00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:54.110
and I loved that.

00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:56.620
But I knew that we
could kind of break up

00:16:56.620 --> 00:17:00.120
open the rest of the film
and say something bigger.

00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:03.200
And when I met Katie and
I heard her take on it,

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:06.380
I was so inspired, because she
saw exactly what you're seeing.

00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:08.599
She saw the way to
break it out of the box,

00:17:08.599 --> 00:17:13.780
make everything more nuanced and
just deeply much, much funnier

00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:14.540
and smarter.

00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:16.240
And I was like,
this is exciting,

00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:18.400
because we knew we
had the opportunity

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:20.243
to make something
different and to take

00:17:20.243 --> 00:17:21.910
something people
thought they understood

00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:23.560
and to kind of flip
it on its back.

00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:30.640
But I was really amazed at the
speed and the skill of Katie

00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:33.715
as she kind of reshaped
the entire thing.

00:17:33.715 --> 00:17:35.613
KATIE SILBERMAN: Thank you.

00:17:35.613 --> 00:17:37.780
One thing that's really
fun, that you kind of hit on

00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:40.840
before too, though, is I
think movies and high school

00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:42.520
are probably the
two areas in life

00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:44.920
where archetypes
are the most used

00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:46.450
and you can jump to easily.

00:17:46.450 --> 00:17:49.195
So the boxes that you put
people to in high school--

00:17:49.195 --> 00:17:51.070
the same way you're
searching for characters,

00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:53.985
like as moviegoers, you're
just as likely as the audience

00:17:53.985 --> 00:17:56.110
to try and say like, oh,
that's the hot guy, that's

00:17:56.110 --> 00:17:58.340
the mean girl, that's
the dorky girl.

00:17:58.340 --> 00:18:01.540
And so we got to play into
those archetypes on both levels,

00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:03.790
both the archetypes that
Molly and Amy were projecting

00:18:03.790 --> 00:18:05.748
onto all of their classmates
and the archetypes

00:18:05.748 --> 00:18:08.290
that the audience would so
easily project onto the people

00:18:08.290 --> 00:18:09.760
that they were seeing on screen.

00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:11.890
And the dream for us
from the beginning

00:18:11.890 --> 00:18:14.320
was to create a world
and an ensemble where

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:16.870
any of the characters, you
would be happy if we just

00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:18.120
turned and followed them--

00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:20.120
you would watch a whole
movie about all of them,

00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:22.412
which is, I think, sometimes
in movies, what you forget

00:18:22.412 --> 00:18:24.790
to do-- like forget to create
a world that's full enough

00:18:24.790 --> 00:18:27.497
that you would be interested
in following all of them

00:18:27.497 --> 00:18:29.330
throughout the rest of
their nights as well.

00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:31.538
So that was a fun challenge
to set up, because that's

00:18:31.538 --> 00:18:32.620
what high school is like.

00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:35.287
Also, there are all these people
you see in a classroom and only

00:18:35.287 --> 00:18:37.750
defined by the way they
interact on the school building

00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:40.030
and seeing them outside-- like
if you ever run into someone

00:18:40.030 --> 00:18:40.985
from school at like a--

00:18:40.985 --> 00:18:42.818
I was going to say a
Blockbuster, which is--

00:18:42.818 --> 00:18:45.220
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:47.640
Or like waiting for the
horse and carriage to come.

00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:49.050
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:49.050 --> 00:18:51.100
But when you see
people that you only

00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:53.320
knew in school outside of
school with their families

00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:56.562
or with their friends, it was
so startling to be like, oh,

00:18:56.562 --> 00:18:58.270
you have this whole
world outside of here

00:18:58.270 --> 00:19:00.667
that I don't know and so
being able to peel back

00:19:00.667 --> 00:19:02.500
throughout the night
everyone else at school

00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:04.960
was probably the
most fun challenge.

00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:06.790
SPEAKER 1: I hope that
you're contemplating

00:19:06.790 --> 00:19:09.130
spin-offs, single films for
each of these characters

00:19:09.130 --> 00:19:10.660
as well as they go through.

00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:16.090
We want to see, obviously, Amy
off in Botswana, definitely

00:19:16.090 --> 00:19:16.915
Tanner at Stanford.

00:19:16.915 --> 00:19:18.200
NICO HIRAGA: Stanford.

00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:19.660
SPEAKER 1: Absolutely.

00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:22.570
So I'm actually curious
while folks line up--

00:19:22.570 --> 00:19:25.000
I'm curious what the
origin of this film was.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.120
Who originated that first
seedling of an idea?

00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:30.400
Where did that come from?

00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:31.900
KATIE SILBERMAN:
The original script

00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:34.978
was written in 2009,
so 10 years ago,

00:19:34.978 --> 00:19:37.270
by two really talented writers,
Emily Halpern and Sarah

00:19:37.270 --> 00:19:38.140
Haskins.

00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:41.770
And it's been around
in different iterations

00:19:41.770 --> 00:19:45.340
in that decade, the core idea
being a story about two really

00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:47.100
smart best friends
in high school.

00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:49.780
And I think the story kind
of evolved and changed

00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:53.260
with different people attached
at different times in ways

00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:57.040
to kind of reflect what it was
like in these different time

00:19:57.040 --> 00:19:58.810
periods as well, even
the change for what

00:19:58.810 --> 00:20:03.190
it was like for young women
in 2009 to 2012 to 2015.

00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:06.280
I think there's been a
desire for a kind of movie

00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:07.810
like this for a long time.

00:20:07.810 --> 00:20:10.480
And then I felt really
lucky that when I came on

00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:13.210
and Olivia was attached and
had this unbelievable vision

00:20:13.210 --> 00:20:16.210
and just energy towards it,
that we were able to say,

00:20:16.210 --> 00:20:18.200
what is the movie we
want to make right now?

00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:19.210
And what's the high
school movie we feel

00:20:19.210 --> 00:20:20.695
like we've never seen before?

00:20:20.695 --> 00:20:22.450
OLIVIA WILDE: It's
almost like the society

00:20:22.450 --> 00:20:25.690
had to catch up with the
concept before it could be made.

00:20:25.690 --> 00:20:28.270
SPEAKER 1: It feels very much
that way when you watch it.

00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:31.420
And clearly, it was very
impressive after taking

00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:34.432
10 years to actually
make the film.

00:20:34.432 --> 00:20:35.890
And for you, being
your first time,

00:20:35.890 --> 00:20:37.850
it was a very
impressive first try.

00:20:37.850 --> 00:20:38.850
OLIVIA WILDE: Thank you.

00:20:38.850 --> 00:20:42.550
SPEAKER 1: At Google, we
like to say, fail fast,

00:20:42.550 --> 00:20:44.710
and we're all very
familiar with this concept

00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:48.370
of failing on the first try.

00:20:48.370 --> 00:20:50.040
You just skipped over that part.

00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:52.310
A 100% rating on Rotten
Tomatoes for your first one

00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:52.930
ain't so bad.

00:20:55.490 --> 00:20:56.554
Clap for that.

00:20:56.554 --> 00:21:01.540
[APPLAUSE]

00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:03.555
Should we go to audience Q&amp;A?

00:21:03.555 --> 00:21:05.630
AUDIENCE: So I have
a two part question.

00:21:05.630 --> 00:21:07.330
One is for the
group, which is, what

00:21:07.330 --> 00:21:09.730
was the most challenging
part of making the movie?

00:21:09.730 --> 00:21:12.100
And then the second part
is specifically for Olivia.

00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:15.400
You talked about getting to
35 to make that transition,

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:17.800
to something that you'd
wanted to do at 23.

00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:20.440
And I think all of us have
dreams and inspirations

00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:22.480
that we're trying to
get to or that we're at,

00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:24.190
and just any advice
you can give in terms

00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:30.268
of getting over that barrier
and what that looks like.

00:21:30.268 --> 00:21:31.060
OLIVIA WILDE: Sure.

00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:33.643
Well, I'll take that one first,
because it's fresh in my mind.

00:21:35.687 --> 00:21:37.270
It makes me think
of my mom, actually.

00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:41.420
My mom ran for Congress
last year in Virginia.

00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:44.710
And it was incredibly inspiring,
because it was a pivot for her

00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:45.940
at 66 years old.

00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:49.450
She'd been a journalist for
35 years, top of her game

00:21:49.450 --> 00:21:52.480
journalist, produced "60
Minutes" for 10 years,

00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:53.960
"Frontline," "ABC News."

00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:55.360
You name it, she made it.

00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:59.860
And seeing her decide, actually,
after the 2016 election,

00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:01.393
that she needed to--

00:22:01.393 --> 00:22:03.560
she said, the real resistance
is running for office.

00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:05.950
And I have an incredible
amount of respect for her.

00:22:05.950 --> 00:22:09.610
So watching her pivot at that
point in life was incredible.

00:22:09.610 --> 00:22:12.660
It happened to be the same
exact moment I was pivoting.

00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:15.930
So we were in these parallel
tracks of reinvention.

00:22:15.930 --> 00:22:19.500
And we talked a lot about what
that process is like and how

00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:22.200
really what it is giving
yourself permission

00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:26.220
and understanding that you're
worthy of that reinvention,

00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:27.220
and that you--

00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:29.220
much like we were just
speaking of in this film,

00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:32.610
a lot of the kind of barriers
we create are self-generated.

00:22:32.610 --> 00:22:37.860
A lot of what keeps us in a
place of acting out of fear

00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:39.360
is just self-generated.

00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:42.943
And if you give yourself
permission to do

00:22:42.943 --> 00:22:44.610
whatever it is you
want to do, no matter

00:22:44.610 --> 00:22:46.892
how far it is from what
you're currently doing--

00:22:46.892 --> 00:22:48.600
it's amazing when you
realize, oh really,

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:49.767
no one else was stopping me?

00:22:49.767 --> 00:22:52.115
That was just me, huh?

00:22:52.115 --> 00:22:53.740
I wish I had done
that a long time ago.

00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:56.970
But I think it's
something that's

00:22:56.970 --> 00:22:59.530
kind of incredible about
being a human being.

00:22:59.530 --> 00:23:03.810
And I think so often we choose
a track at 19 years old.

00:23:03.810 --> 00:23:06.120
You go to college, and you're
like, this is my major.

00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:08.310
Or maybe after college,
you're like, well,

00:23:08.310 --> 00:23:10.740
that's what I studied, and
now I'm picking my career.

00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:12.540
And you really
trust a 24-year-old

00:23:12.540 --> 00:23:15.180
to make a decision that
should last for a lifetime?

00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:16.585
No.

00:23:16.585 --> 00:23:19.740
I think what stops us
sometimes from pivoting

00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:23.070
is this fear that it will seem
like it somehow devalues what

00:23:23.070 --> 00:23:26.400
we did before, that
it somehow implies

00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:30.060
a hypocrisy of some
type, that oh, it

00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:33.318
means that this wasn't real.

00:23:33.318 --> 00:23:35.610
A lot of people have been
asking me, so no more acting?

00:23:35.610 --> 00:23:36.902
I guess that wasn't your thing.

00:23:36.902 --> 00:23:39.300
And I'm like, you know
what, I love acting.

00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:39.960
It's catharsis.

00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:40.600
It's therapy.

00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:42.610
It's the most fun
thing in the world.

00:23:42.610 --> 00:23:45.670
It is something I hope
to do as well as this.

00:23:45.670 --> 00:23:48.510
Why do we have to choose?

00:23:48.510 --> 00:23:50.010
I've been thinking
so much about it.

00:23:50.010 --> 00:23:53.760
We make these choices, and we
put this pressure on ourselves.

00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:54.570
Why?

00:23:54.570 --> 00:23:56.200
We get one life.

00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:58.500
We should try everything.

00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:02.038
And I think for me, the fear was
like, well, I've chosen acting,

00:24:02.038 --> 00:24:03.330
and I didn't go to film school.

00:24:03.330 --> 00:24:08.760
So I guess this is my track and
then realized, no way, there

00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:13.370
are plenty of inspiring
examples of people

00:24:13.370 --> 00:24:14.370
who have made that leap.

00:24:14.370 --> 00:24:16.830
And I really want to go for it.

00:24:16.830 --> 00:24:20.700
Also, getting rid of the fear
of failure, I love fail fast.

00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:22.920
The idea that just,
go for it, truly

00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:24.640
what's the worst
thing that can happen?

00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:27.310
You don't want to die
regretting that you didn't try.

00:24:27.310 --> 00:24:28.792
So that's my take on that.

00:24:28.792 --> 00:24:30.750
And then in terms of what
was most challenging,

00:24:30.750 --> 00:24:32.160
I'll throw that to you
guys, because I just

00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:32.920
had fun everyday.

00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:33.930
And nothing was hard.

00:24:33.930 --> 00:24:36.330
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:36.330 --> 00:24:39.720
KAITLYN DEVER: I almost started
crying during that answer.

00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:43.240
You made me believe in myself.

00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:45.300
I feel like everything
that Beanie and I

00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:48.840
thought was going to
be a challenge ended up

00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:50.220
not being one.

00:24:50.220 --> 00:24:52.600
BEANIE FELDSTEIN: First
I was like, Mandarin?

00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:54.420
OK.

00:24:54.420 --> 00:24:56.205
And then it ended
up being so fun.

00:24:56.205 --> 00:24:57.330
KAITLYN DEVER: Yes, so fun.

00:24:57.330 --> 00:24:58.210
It was very easy.

00:24:58.210 --> 00:25:00.990
I think also when we
first sat down with Liv,

00:25:00.990 --> 00:25:05.970
she really wanted to stick to
the no sides on set rule, which

00:25:05.970 --> 00:25:07.590
is--

00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:10.628
usually on sets, I'll usually
have my lines in rehearsal,

00:25:10.628 --> 00:25:11.920
and everyone's looking at them.

00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:13.230
And it's sort of distracting.

00:25:13.230 --> 00:25:15.270
And we were like, oh
boy, we're talking

00:25:15.270 --> 00:25:17.860
the whole time in the movie,
and how are we going to do that?

00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:20.595
And it was super easy.

00:25:20.595 --> 00:25:21.440
It was great.

00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:24.570
And then the 26 day shoot
also seemed daunting

00:25:24.570 --> 00:25:25.948
but then it all--

00:25:25.948 --> 00:25:26.490
I don't know.

00:25:26.490 --> 00:25:28.050
I don't think anything
was really challenging.

00:25:28.050 --> 00:25:29.425
BEANIE FELDSTEIN:
I think for me,

00:25:29.425 --> 00:25:33.210
the scariest thing was Molly
herself really scared me.

00:25:33.210 --> 00:25:37.590
I think in the few things I've
been lucky enough to be in,

00:25:37.590 --> 00:25:41.880
I have always played a very
endearing, sweet person,

00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:44.490
and that is who I
like to project myself

00:25:44.490 --> 00:25:45.900
into the world as.

00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:47.220
And I loved Molly.

00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:50.310
But I was also so intimidated
by her, because at first glance,

00:25:50.310 --> 00:25:51.980
she's not that at all.

00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:55.470
And she's really intense
and unapologetically so.

00:25:55.470 --> 00:25:59.290
And I think that scared me.

00:25:59.290 --> 00:26:03.390
It took a lot of bravery to
not hold back and not say,

00:26:03.390 --> 00:26:07.710
well, she's not being kind,
and she's not nice right now.

00:26:07.710 --> 00:26:09.190
And that's kind of hard.

00:26:09.190 --> 00:26:10.527
And that's just not who she is.

00:26:10.527 --> 00:26:11.735
She leads with her intellect.

00:26:11.735 --> 00:26:14.950
She leads with her passion, and
she leads with her love of Amy.

00:26:14.950 --> 00:26:19.020
But other than that, she doesn't
care about being pleasant,

00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:21.780
and that was really scary
and then, ultimately,

00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:23.670
really inspiring to me.

00:26:23.670 --> 00:26:25.680
MASON GOODING: It's just
so funny, because when

00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:27.300
people say the hardest part--

00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:29.760
an easy answer would be,
four weeks of night shoots

00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:31.860
is hard for sure.

00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:35.520
But it never once
genuinely felt like I

00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:40.350
was pushing myself to do
something I felt I had to do.

00:26:40.350 --> 00:26:42.970
That was part of an atmosphere
that was built on set.

00:26:42.970 --> 00:26:45.660
It's part of having a great
cast to support you and push you

00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:48.120
to be your best, inherently.

00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:50.940
And every day on
set was a treat,

00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:56.640
and it felt like I came to
do exactly what I loved.

00:26:56.640 --> 00:27:00.458
I'm sure I speak for all of us
when it felt like every time

00:27:00.458 --> 00:27:02.250
we showed up on set,
you could see everyone

00:27:02.250 --> 00:27:03.210
was excited to be there.

00:27:03.210 --> 00:27:05.418
Everyone was bringing their
A game, that it was like,

00:27:05.418 --> 00:27:06.480
oh, wait, this is--

00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:09.420
we're making something
that can ultimately

00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:11.520
touch a whole bunch of people.

00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:13.290
I'm going to do my
best, regardless.

00:27:13.290 --> 00:27:16.110
So hard is funny.

00:27:16.110 --> 00:27:18.750
Sure, things were difficult
in terms of [? diamond ?]

00:27:18.750 --> 00:27:20.075
but it all was a dream.

00:27:20.075 --> 00:27:21.450
KATIE SILBERMAN:
I honestly think

00:27:21.450 --> 00:27:23.880
the hardest part was the
deep depression that set in

00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:25.390
as it started to be over.

00:27:25.390 --> 00:27:27.435
BEANIE FELDSTEIN: She
says that she got married

00:27:27.435 --> 00:27:30.720
our last week of production.

00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:32.020
KATIE SILBERMAN: That's true.

00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:34.020
KAITLYN DEVER: I don't
want to go to my wedding.

00:27:34.020 --> 00:27:35.490
I want to be with you guys.

00:27:35.490 --> 00:27:36.162
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:36.162 --> 00:27:37.625
KATIE SILBERMAN: Conner, hi.

00:27:37.625 --> 00:27:39.420
KAITLYN DEVER: We love
you, Conner, hello.

00:27:43.290 --> 00:27:45.690
NICO HIRAGA: I was completely
agreeing with Katie.

00:27:45.690 --> 00:27:49.290
The hardest part was being
like, oh, the movie's over.

00:27:49.290 --> 00:27:50.670
We're done filming.

00:27:50.670 --> 00:27:55.676
That was for sure the hardest
part of the whole process.

00:27:55.676 --> 00:27:59.520
Other than that, it would be
like hitting the Snooze button

00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:03.390
on your phone when your alarm
goes off in the morning.

00:28:03.390 --> 00:28:04.500
That was hard.

00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:07.810
But other than
that, everything--

00:28:07.810 --> 00:28:08.310
solid.

00:28:08.310 --> 00:28:10.320
SPEAKER 1: It sounds like
during the course of this film,

00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:12.210
you really built it
up into a family,

00:28:12.210 --> 00:28:14.520
and I am sure that
spending that much time--

00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:15.092
we know.

00:28:15.092 --> 00:28:16.050
We're working on teams.

00:28:16.050 --> 00:28:16.883
We're doing sprints.

00:28:16.883 --> 00:28:18.765
You're spending hours
and days [INAUDIBLE]..

00:28:18.765 --> 00:28:21.307
My poor colleague, Anthony, will
know what I'm talking about,

00:28:21.307 --> 00:28:23.180
because he has to spend
every day with me.

00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:26.070
But sometimes, you develop a
really strong sense of family,

00:28:26.070 --> 00:28:27.130
and sometimes you don't.

00:28:27.130 --> 00:28:29.670
So did you have methods for
building a sense of trust

00:28:29.670 --> 00:28:31.410
in between you as
individuals in order

00:28:31.410 --> 00:28:35.760
to help benefit that bond that
actually came out in the film?

00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:38.700
Did you have tactics, or was it
simply spending time together

00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:40.332
that got you all that close?

00:28:40.332 --> 00:28:42.530
NICO HIRAGA: Olivia
was a mommy figure

00:28:42.530 --> 00:28:45.810
during this whole filming.

00:28:45.810 --> 00:28:49.407
Mason, Eduardo, and I,
we all had playdates

00:28:49.407 --> 00:28:50.490
throughout the whole film.

00:28:50.490 --> 00:28:51.755
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:51.755 --> 00:28:53.570
MASON GOODING: We
filmed them, too.

00:28:53.570 --> 00:28:54.860
NICO HIRAGA: It's on film.

00:28:54.860 --> 00:28:56.930
MASON GOODING: You'll see
them at some point, I'm sure.

00:28:56.930 --> 00:28:58.340
SPEAKER 1: Amazing,
please send those clips.

00:28:58.340 --> 00:29:00.257
MASON GOODING: Of course,
to you specifically.

00:29:00.257 --> 00:29:02.240
OLIVIA WILDE: There's
one where an orange was

00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:03.380
sliced with a machete.

00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:05.550
MASON GOODING: Yeah, it
was a full knight's sword.

00:29:05.550 --> 00:29:08.120
OLIVIA WILDE: Slow motion,
a knight's sword slicing.

00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:10.650
MASON GOODING: Yeah, I have
a replica "Game of Thrones"

00:29:10.650 --> 00:29:11.150
sword.

00:29:11.150 --> 00:29:13.210
I told you, I was a big
dark in high school.

00:29:13.210 --> 00:29:14.310
And we found a
bunch of oranges--

00:29:14.310 --> 00:29:16.435
SPEAKER 1: You're in very
good company, by the way.

00:29:16.435 --> 00:29:19.475
MASON GOODING: Well,
good, Season 8, right?

00:29:19.475 --> 00:29:21.350
And we were just throwing
them at each other,

00:29:21.350 --> 00:29:22.975
and we would slice
them with the sword.

00:29:22.975 --> 00:29:25.183
OLIVIA WILDE: This makes me
think of something that's

00:29:25.183 --> 00:29:26.990
really singular
about this cast, is

00:29:26.990 --> 00:29:29.930
that I asked them to
do quite a lot outside

00:29:29.930 --> 00:29:32.300
of the official working hours.

00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:33.910
I knew that in order
for this to work,

00:29:33.910 --> 00:29:38.030
it would be made or
broken by their chemistry.

00:29:38.030 --> 00:29:40.552
So I asked them to hang out.

00:29:40.552 --> 00:29:43.010
They could have said, listen
lady, I'll show up on the days

00:29:43.010 --> 00:29:45.593
I'm working, but you can't tell
me what to do on the weekends.

00:29:45.593 --> 00:29:47.720
And instead, everybody
was so inspired.

00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:49.670
Before we started
filming, we all

00:29:49.670 --> 00:29:52.275
gathered to watch "Fast
Times at Ridgemont High."

00:29:52.275 --> 00:29:53.900
And the reason I
really wanted everyone

00:29:53.900 --> 00:29:58.430
to see that before filming was
because that film is so alive

00:29:58.430 --> 00:29:59.270
and fleshed out.

00:29:59.270 --> 00:30:00.710
The ensemble is so real.

00:30:00.710 --> 00:30:03.110
There are no small
characters, no small roles.

00:30:03.110 --> 00:30:07.287
Everybody feels so nuanced
that everyone's making choices.

00:30:07.287 --> 00:30:09.620
And most of all, they feel
like they went to high school

00:30:09.620 --> 00:30:10.500
together.

00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:13.340
So I knew we had
to achieve that.

00:30:13.340 --> 00:30:15.380
And I said, please, go hang out.

00:30:15.380 --> 00:30:17.150
I did send them on playdates.

00:30:17.150 --> 00:30:20.122
And I did do everything
I could to convince

00:30:20.122 --> 00:30:22.080
them to live together,
and it didn't take much.

00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:23.940
As you heard, they
were very into it.

00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:27.680
And I really think
the movie feels

00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:31.160
good because of their
commitment outside of work,

00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:34.490
and that's just something you
can't guarantee as a director.

00:30:34.490 --> 00:30:35.960
How do you know
that you can cast

00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:38.655
people who will love this
project as much as you?

00:30:38.655 --> 00:30:41.030
KATIE SILBERMAN: It also comes
from the top down, though.

00:30:41.030 --> 00:30:45.980
Because when your leader is as
open and encouraging and warm

00:30:45.980 --> 00:30:48.230
as Olivia was, it sets
a tone where everyone is

00:30:48.230 --> 00:30:50.270
able to be as open in response.

00:30:50.270 --> 00:30:52.370
And that is what creates,
I think, the camaraderie

00:30:52.370 --> 00:30:54.060
and the friendship
and that vibe.

00:30:54.060 --> 00:30:56.750
It's like, when that is the tone
that's set from the beginning,

00:30:56.750 --> 00:30:58.370
it encourages everyone
else to bring--

00:30:58.370 --> 00:31:00.230
not just their A
game and their energy

00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:03.260
and their enthusiasm like that,
but also to keep their hearts

00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:05.930
open the whole time, which is
a really rare thing on a set

00:31:05.930 --> 00:31:08.450
and felt really singular
and special here.

00:31:08.450 --> 00:31:09.623
SPEAKER 1: That's awesome.

00:31:09.623 --> 00:31:11.165
I think we'll take
our last question.

00:31:11.165 --> 00:31:13.160
AUDIENCE: Out of curiosity,
how much of the cast

00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:15.660
had actually seen "Fast Times"
before you showed it to them?

00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:17.000
OLIVIA WILDE: Many had not.

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:18.565
Had you guys have seen it?

00:31:18.565 --> 00:31:19.440
Had you guys seen it?

00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:19.710
MASON GOODING: No.

00:31:19.710 --> 00:31:20.960
OLIVIA WILDE: You had seen it.

00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:22.410
NICO HIRAGA: I'd seen it.

00:31:22.410 --> 00:31:23.540
Spicoli was a big--

00:31:23.540 --> 00:31:24.705
OLIVIA WILDE: I'm shocked.

00:31:24.705 --> 00:31:27.090
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:27.090 --> 00:31:30.120
So maybe half and half.

00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:30.690
Maybe.

00:31:30.690 --> 00:31:32.880
I know a lot of people came
up to me afterwards and said,

00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:33.720
I'd ever seen that.

00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:34.630
I love that.

00:31:34.630 --> 00:31:36.630
And it was real exciting,
because Amy Heckerling

00:31:36.630 --> 00:31:37.910
directed that and "Clueless."

00:31:37.910 --> 00:31:41.070
So it was fun to tell people,
that great mind brought you

00:31:41.070 --> 00:31:44.370
that defining generational
anthem, as well as one

00:31:44.370 --> 00:31:47.460
that you maybe saw in the '90s.

00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:48.600
How did she do that?

00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:51.420
How did she capture the '70s
and the '90s so perfectly?

00:31:51.420 --> 00:31:52.170
It's a real skill.

00:31:52.170 --> 00:31:54.378
SPEAKER 1: It really does
feel like "Booksmart" could

00:31:54.378 --> 00:31:56.790
be that anthem for
this current generation

00:31:56.790 --> 00:32:00.180
and what a refreshing,
wonderful, progressive, lovely

00:32:00.180 --> 00:32:01.090
take it is.

00:32:01.090 --> 00:32:02.958
So it is out on May 24.

00:32:02.958 --> 00:32:04.500
Everyone's going to
go see it, right?

00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:05.583
Just raise your hand, yes.

00:32:05.583 --> 00:32:06.840
100%.

00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:07.340
Yes.

00:32:07.340 --> 00:32:08.615
OLIVIA WILDE: Thank you.

00:32:08.615 --> 00:32:11.940
SPEAKER 1: So thank you all so,
so very much for being here.

00:32:11.940 --> 00:32:13.170
It was such a pleasure.

00:32:13.170 --> 00:32:14.100
Big round of applause, please.

00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:15.072
BEANIE FELDSTEIN: Thank you.

00:32:15.072 --> 00:32:16.030
NICO HIRAGA: Thank you.

00:32:16.030 --> 00:32:19.810
[APPLAUSE]
