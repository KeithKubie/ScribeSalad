00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:07.450
so in the early days including from the
 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:10.410
so in the early days including from the
time of Aristotle and later in 16 and

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:10.420
time of Aristotle and later in 16 and

17th century most of physiognomy

17th century most of physiognomy
 

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:15.900
17th century most of physiognomy
consisted of this whimsical comparisons

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:15.910
consisted of this whimsical comparisons
 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:17.850
consisted of this whimsical comparisons
between the physiognomy of humans and

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:17.860
between the physiognomy of humans and
 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:21.390
between the physiognomy of humans and
animals so for example you would have a

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:21.400
animals so for example you would have a
 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.970
animals so for example you would have a
drawing of a human who presumably look

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:23.980
drawing of a human who presumably look
 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.849
drawing of a human who presumably look
looks like a cow and from there you will

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:26.859
looks like a cow and from there you will
 

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:29.040
looks like a cow and from there you will
make all kinds of inferences that

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:29.050
make all kinds of inferences that
 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.009
make all kinds of inferences that
perhaps the character of the person

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019
perhaps the character of the person
 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.000
perhaps the character of the person
matches the character of the cow

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.010
matches the character of the cow
 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.820
matches the character of the cow
whatever that might be in fact if you

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:35.830
whatever that might be in fact if you
 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:38.399
whatever that might be in fact if you
look at the history of European history

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:38.409
look at the history of European history
 

00:00:38.409 --> 00:00:41.700

most of the 19th century's novels a

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.320
standard feature of this analysis that
you have his genomic descriptions of the

you have his genomic descriptions of the
 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:48.960
you have his genomic descriptions of the
characters so it was a big very very

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:48.970

evolutionary ideas and the so called
 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:17.160

character angle is they were quite

character angle is they were quite
 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.560
character angle is they were quite
influential and they were involved

heavily in business and recruitment of
 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.219
heavily in business and recruitment of

when the new science of psychology

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:28.479
when the new science of psychology
 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:31.139
when the new science of psychology
arises and then psychologists are kind

00:01:31.139 --> 00:01:31.149
arises and then psychologists are kind
 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:33.959
arises and then psychologists are kind
of skeptical about the claims of the

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:33.969
of skeptical about the claims of the
 

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:35.849
of skeptical about the claims of the

this impression was discovered over

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520
this impression was discovered over
 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.029
this impression was discovered over
hundred years ago in psychology but

00:01:42.029 --> 00:01:42.039
hundred years ago in psychology but
 

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:43.709
hundred years ago in psychology but
psychologists at the time were really

00:01:43.709 --> 00:01:43.719
psychologists at the time were really
 

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:46.319
psychologists at the time were really
focused on the accuracy of the

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:46.329
focused on the accuracy of the
 

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:47.639
focused on the accuracy of the
impressions and paid very little

00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:47.649
impressions and paid very little
 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:50.399
impressions and paid very little
attention to the extremely interesting

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:50.409
attention to the extremely interesting
 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:52.440
attention to the extremely interesting
psychological fact that we actually

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450
psychological fact that we actually
 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.559
psychological fact that we actually
agree on these impressions very often in

00:01:55.559 --> 00:01:55.569
agree on these impressions very often in
 

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:58.830
agree on these impressions very often in
psychology and in many and generally in

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840
psychology and in many and generally in
 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.989
psychology and in many and generally in
the social sciences lately if you

00:02:00.989 --> 00:02:00.999
the social sciences lately if you
 

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:03.620
the social sciences lately if you
observe that there's a pervasive bias

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630
observe that there's a pervasive bias
 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.209
observe that there's a pervasive bias
that is it's something that feels

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:06.219
that is it's something that feels
 

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:09.950
that is it's something that feels
failure automatic and we can all do it

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:09.960
failure automatic and we can all do it
 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.300
failure automatic and we can all do it
there is a kind of almost an immediate

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310
there is a kind of almost an immediate
 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.309
there is a kind of almost an immediate
assumption that my this might be

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319
assumption that my this might be
 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:16.290
assumption that my this might be
actually wired that it's

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300
actually wired that it's
 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.730
actually wired that it's
something that we are born to be able to

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:20.740
something that we are born to be able to
 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:25.220
something that we are born to be able to
do of course you can easily think of

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230
do of course you can easily think of
 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.410
do of course you can easily think of
counter examples like learn driving

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420
counter examples like learn driving
 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.600
counter examples like learn driving
which essentially becomes automatic and

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610
which essentially becomes automatic and
 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:31.920
which essentially becomes automatic and
there's nothing evolutionary about

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930
there's nothing evolutionary about
 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.390
there's nothing evolutionary about
driving or reading but nevertheless

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400
driving or reading but nevertheless
 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.220
driving or reading but nevertheless
thinks that seems to have been present

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230
thinks that seems to have been present
 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.230
thinks that seems to have been present
always in our environment like faces

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:40.240
always in our environment like faces
 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.230
always in our environment like faces
that seems like a natural assumptions

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240
that seems like a natural assumptions
 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.610
that seems like a natural assumptions
it's interesting actually we've done

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620
it's interesting actually we've done
 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.480
it's interesting actually we've done
some studies it's as I said there are

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:48.490
some studies it's as I said there are
 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:49.830
some studies it's as I said there are
many many different inputs to

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840
many many different inputs to
 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.570
many many different inputs to
impressions right one is emotional

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580
impressions right one is emotional
 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.050
impressions right one is emotional
expressions there's stereotypes about

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060
expressions there's stereotypes about
 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.860
expressions there's stereotypes about
gender

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870
gender
 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.040
gender
there's cues about age in facial

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.050
there's cues about age in facial
 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:01.740
there's cues about age in facial
maturity all of these go into our

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750
maturity all of these go into our
 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.020
maturity all of these go into our
impressions another one that is very

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030
impressions another one that is very
 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.230
impressions another one that is very
interesting is typicality so as it

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:07.240
interesting is typicality so as it
 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.650
interesting is typicality so as it
turned out we tend to like phases that

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660
turned out we tend to like phases that
 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.840
turned out we tend to like phases that
are typical that means phases that the

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850
are typical that means phases that the
 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:14.940
are typical that means phases that the
closer to what we perceive is typical in

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950
closer to what we perceive is typical in
 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.790
closer to what we perceive is typical in
our social environment now though

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:17.800
our social environment now though
 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.060
our social environment now though
there's an interesting wrinkle because

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070
there's an interesting wrinkle because
 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:23.090
there's an interesting wrinkle because
typicality is also culturally specific

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100
typicality is also culturally specific
 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.940
typicality is also culturally specific
especially if if the different cultures

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950
especially if if the different cultures
 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.360
especially if if the different cultures
are linked to different ethnicities and

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370
are linked to different ethnicities and
 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.280
are linked to different ethnicities and
there is distinctive physiognomy x' and

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290
there is distinctive physiognomy x' and
 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.500
there is distinctive physiognomy x' and
that makes it worse we've done a study

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510
that makes it worse we've done a study
 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.979
that makes it worse we've done a study
where we created morphs of a typical

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989
where we created morphs of a typical
 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:40.620
where we created morphs of a typical
Japanese face and a typical Israeli face

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630
Japanese face and a typical Israeli face
 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:44.160
Japanese face and a typical Israeli face
and then we can Interpol interpolate the

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.170
and then we can Interpol interpolate the
 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:46.320
and then we can Interpol interpolate the
morph so we can imagine like a typical

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:46.330
morph so we can imagine like a typical
 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:48.150
morph so we can imagine like a typical
Japanese face gradually turning in a

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160
Japanese face gradually turning in a
 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.449
Japanese face gradually turning in a
typical Israeli face now if you ask

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:51.459
typical Israeli face now if you ask
 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:55.199
typical Israeli face now if you ask
Israeli in Japanese participants to

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:55.209
Israeli in Japanese participants to
 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:57.810
Israeli in Japanese participants to
evaluate the faces what happens is that

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:57.820
evaluate the faces what happens is that
 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:00.420
evaluate the faces what happens is that
as the face become more Israeli looking

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430
as the face become more Israeli looking
 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.910
as the face become more Israeli looking
the Israelis believe that the face is

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:02.920
the Israelis believe that the face is
 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.580
the Israelis believe that the face is
becoming more trustworthy and the other

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.590
becoming more trustworthy and the other
 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:08.160
becoming more trustworthy and the other
way around for the Japanese so in a

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.170
way around for the Japanese so in a
 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:10.410
