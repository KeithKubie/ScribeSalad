00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.440
One of our goals here at
Udacity is to help you become

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:05.710
an independent developer.

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:09.140
Not independent in the sense
that you only work alone, but

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:14.310
that you feel empowered to take on new
projects, research unfamiliar ideas,

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:16.059
and ask questions without our help.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.770
I would like to first go over some of
the types of reference material that

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:24.510
is available to you on the web,
as well as some strategies

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.250
to help you determine if a resource
will be valuable to use.
