was always there and supposedly I could
 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.870
was always there and supposedly I could
identify and I knew each individual ant

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880
identify and I knew each individual ant
 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.300
identify and I knew each individual ant
by her name so I would say that one's

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310
by her name so I would say that one's
 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.700

unless I could document somehow so I got

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070
unless I could document somehow so I got
 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.340
unless I could document somehow so I got
a book on how to photograph supermodels

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350
a book on how to photograph supermodels
 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.260
a book on how to photograph supermodels
and figured out that you needed a main

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270
and figured out that you needed a main
 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.740
and figured out that you needed a main
light a fill light and a hair light and

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750
light a fill light and a hair light and
 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.899
light a fill light and a hair light and
with these three lights you can get a

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909
with these three lights you can get a
 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.510
with these three lights you can get a
kind of a studio effect that's quite

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520
kind of a studio effect that's quite
 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.210
kind of a studio effect that's quite
beautiful so my aunt's have a nice hair

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220
beautiful so my aunt's have a nice hair
 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.090
beautiful so my aunt's have a nice hair
light so the hairs a sweetly backlit and

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100
light so the hairs a sweetly backlit and
 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.340
light so the hairs a sweetly backlit and
it gives them a like nice dimensionality

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350
it gives them a like nice dimensionality
 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.440
it gives them a like nice dimensionality
and also separates them from their

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450
and also separates them from their
 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.700
and also separates them from their
background and all kinds of things so

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710
background and all kinds of things so
 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.499
background and all kinds of things so
all you have to do is build this studio

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509
all you have to do is build this studio
 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.600
all you have to do is build this studio
into the front of your camera and carry

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610
into the front of your camera and carry
 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.330
into the front of your camera and carry
it around with you so I figured that out

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340
 
 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.370

matter what it is in nature for a long
 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.780
matter what it is in nature for a long
period of time and it's kind of ironic

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790
period of time and it's kind of ironic
 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.029
period of time and it's kind of ironic

action activity and then you go to the
 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.330
action activity and then you go to the
jungle and you're sometimes just sitting

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340
jungle and you're sometimes just sitting
 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.520

some of these things are easily faked
 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.520
some of these things are easily faked
and you see fakes all the time but the

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530
and you see fakes all the time but the
 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.340
and you see fakes all the time but the
true moment is a distinct thing and the

the movement even of an ant has a lot of
 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:36.320
the movement even of an ant has a lot of
action and emotion to it if you catch

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330
action and emotion to it if you catch
 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.590
action and emotion to it if you catch
even an ant in its activity so that
