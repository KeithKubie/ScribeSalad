00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.900
[Narrator:] In an age where average comic book movies make tons of money,

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.380
and average sequels rake in the dough,

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.460
theater nerds finally get something average to blow their wads on, too.

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.280
The Greatest Showman

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.460
From the musical geniuses behind La La Land

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.960
and Dear Evan Hansen,

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.000
comes a film full of pretty visuals

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.880
and catchy hits just begging for an overly sincere Youtube cover video.

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:35.040
[cacophony]

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.760
As you sing along to nine teen-friendly jams

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.820
wrapped in a story that will make you wonder:

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.160
When does the next song start?

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.560
[Charity:] The bank. They're evicting us.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.280
[Narrator:] I'm so not here for the talky bits.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.580
["From Now On"]

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.500
[Narrator:] Ah. That's better.

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.620
Meet P.T. Barnum:

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.520
The boy who grew from wishing he owned his own top hat

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.060
to the man who owned all the top hats,

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:01.040
played by noted top hat enthusiast Hugh Jackman.

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:02.180
M'Logan.

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.560
Follow along on P.T.'s lifelong dream

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.080
to open a weird murder museum --

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.900
[guillotine dropping]

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.040
[hearty laughter]

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.760
-- but when that doesn't pan out,

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.480
he'll roll with his backup plan:

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.520
a scam freak show,  paid for by fraud,

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.700
that he abandons his wife and kids for,

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.960
and ditches the second he has a chance to join high society.

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.360
[P.T.:] Okay, have a great show.
[Letty:] Wait -- [door slams]

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.780
[Narrator:] But after a series of show stopping musical numbers,

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.180
this social-climbing con man will be met with

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.380
[questioningly] lifelong success and happiness?

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.640
[Lettie:] Maybe you are a fraud. Maybe it was just about makin' a buck.

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.360
[Narrator:] Uh-oh. They're on to you. Quick, do a hat trick!

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.060
[ensemble laughing]

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.840
Witness this real-life Willy Wonka

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.560
but instead of selling kids candy,

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.160
he's selling kids tickets to laugh at the Oompa Loompas.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.460
Where the tragedy of these people's exploitation is brushed aside...

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.040
[P.T.:] Well, they're laughing anyway kid, so might as well get paid.

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.980
[Narrator:] ...to spend more time with two perfect physical specimens.

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.720
Feast your eyes on a forbidden romance subplot

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.740
where Zac Efron is rich and white

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.600
but Zendaya is poor and usually a body double.

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.300
And while the circus performers have to live with being literally beaten in the streets...

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:05.580
[Angry Man:] You freaks!

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.320
[Narrator:] ...Efron and P.T. will get way more sympathy for having --

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.980
[gasps]

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:10.480
-- snobby parents.

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:11.960
[Mr. Carlyle:] Have you no shame?

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.780
[Mr. Hallett:] Thank you...for your honesty.

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:15.620
[loud slap]

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.560
[Narrator:] And [gasps] even snobbier critics.

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.980
[James Gordon Bennett:] I never liked your show.

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.460
[Narrator:] So march to the beat of your own drum with this upbeat, inspiring musical

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:28.440
about a really shady, cruel historical figure.

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.500
But since too much honesty doesn't sell, we've gotcha covered

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.780
with a more accurate P.T. Barnum musical.

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.940
With songs like, the "he wasn't a good guy" song:

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.320
The "made-up affair" song:

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.920
The "these two people didn't even exist" song:

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.100
And, the "rampant cruelty" song:

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:02.360
Laugh all you can, Barnum,
[dramatic voice:] an elephant never forgets.

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:08.340
