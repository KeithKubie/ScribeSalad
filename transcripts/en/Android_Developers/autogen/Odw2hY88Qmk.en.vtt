hour on yeah the other kick today we're
looking at weather apps with a bomb I in

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769
looking at weather apps with a bomb I in
 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.700
looking at weather apps with a bomb I in
the sky and should I wear pants and then

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710
the sky and should I wear pants and then
 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.230
the sky and should I wear pants and then
we're gonna dig a little deeper into how

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240
we're gonna dig a little deeper into how
 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.679
we're gonna dig a little deeper into how
weather bomb renders its awesome map so

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689
weather bomb renders its awesome map so
 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.569
weather bomb renders its awesome map so
let's have a look at weather apps in

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579
let's have a look at weather apps in
 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.910
let's have a look at weather apps in
general how what are the things that it

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920
general how what are the things that it
 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.840
general how what are the things that it
really needs in order to be a good app

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:37.850
really needs in order to be a good app
 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.280
really needs in order to be a good app
well obviously it needs to tell me

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290
well obviously it needs to tell me
 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.200
well obviously it needs to tell me
today's weather right it seems like a

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210
today's weather right it seems like a
 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.760
today's weather right it seems like a
pretty good stock right because

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770
pretty good stock right because
 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.229
pretty good stock right because

obviously I don't want to get out of bed
 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.959
obviously I don't want to get out of bed
or open the window precisely that would

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969
or open the window precisely that would
 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.520
or open the window precisely that would
work too much to ask right now just be

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530
work too much to ask right now just be
 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:50.840
work too much to ask right now just be
able to know these stuff before you get

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850
able to know these stuff before you get
 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.850
able to know these stuff before you get
out of bed would also be nice to know

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860
out of bed would also be nice to know
 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.010

seven-day forecast I would go for that
 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.010
seven-day forecast I would go for that
exactly all the things which mean that

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020
exactly all the things which mean that
 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.080
exactly all the things which mean that
you no longer are slave to the eleven

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090
you no longer are slave to the eleven
 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.299
you no longer are slave to the eleven
o'clock news absolutely you also want to

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309
o'clock news absolutely you also want to
 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:03.860
o'clock news absolutely you also want to
have results that a localized write

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870
have results that a localized write
 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.570
have results that a localized write
something which knows where you are to

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580
something which knows where you are to
 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.010
something which knows where you are to
give you the way to forecast for you

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020
give you the way to forecast for you

the general that's true but I don't
 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.660
the general that's true but I don't
necessarily want it to local because

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670
necessarily want it to local because
 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.929
necessarily want it to local because
really what I want to know is how cold

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939
really what I want to know is how cold
 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.249
really what I want to know is how cold
or windy is it gonna be at the beach

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259
or windy is it gonna be at the beach
 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.710
or windy is it gonna be at the beach
this time that's true which means you

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720
this time that's true which means you
 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:19.820
this time that's true which means you
really want to be able to have multiple

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830
really want to be able to have multiple
 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.830
really want to be able to have multiple
locations you tell we're in Northern

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840
locations you tell we're in Northern
 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.390
locations you tell we're in Northern
California because I didn't say how hot

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400
California because I didn't say how hot
 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.310
California because I didn't say how hot
and sunny isn't gonna mean that yeah

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320
and sunny isn't gonna mean that yeah
 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.830
and sunny isn't gonna mean that yeah
that's the thing where we are here in in

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840
that's the thing where we are here in in
 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.200
that's the thing where we are here in in
sunny sometimes Northern California it's

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210
sunny sometimes Northern California it's
 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.899
sunny sometimes Northern California it's
an area of extreme microclimate so it's

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909
an area of extreme microclimate so it's
 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.340
an area of extreme microclimate so it's
the localization of the weather is

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350
the localization of the weather is
 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.200
the localization of the weather is
really important and the ability to know

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210
really important and the ability to know
 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.819
really important and the ability to know
which direction you need to drive for it

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829
which direction you need to drive for it
 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.890
which direction you need to drive for it
to get less foggy it's kind of a killer

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900
to get less foggy it's kind of a killer
 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.440
to get less foggy it's kind of a killer
feature exactly if we're gonna take

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450
feature exactly if we're gonna take
 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.030
feature exactly if we're gonna take
things up a little further what we

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040
things up a little further what we
 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.560
things up a little further what we
really like to see is a lot of the stuff

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570
really like to see is a lot of the stuff
 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.719
really like to see is a lot of the stuff
that you used to sing at the eleven

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729
that you used to sing at the eleven
 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.310
that you used to sing at the eleven
o'clock and use things like rich maps

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320
o'clock and use things like rich maps
 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.109
o'clock and use things like rich maps
with sort of more meteorological

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119
with sort of more meteorological
 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.270
with sort of more meteorological
information like topography charts

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280
information like topography charts
 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.460
information like topography charts
satellites those sorts of things yeah

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470
satellites those sorts of things yeah
 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.800
satellites those sorts of things yeah
and also I want to see maps when I'm

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810
and also I want to see maps when I'm
 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.770
and also I want to see maps when I'm
choosing my location absolutely yeah

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780
choosing my location absolutely yeah
 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.240
choosing my location absolutely yeah
that way you don't have to know what

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250
that way you don't have to know what
 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.950
that way you don't have to know what
kind of what city the beach is in you

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960
kind of what city the beach is in you
 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.690
kind of what city the beach is in you
just point at the beach jump done

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700
just point at the beach jump done
 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.190
just point at the beach jump done
oh yeah anytime I can get away from

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200
oh yeah anytime I can get away from
 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.089
oh yeah anytime I can get away from
putting in text to my mobile phone

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:10.099
putting in text to my mobile phone
 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:13.309
putting in text to my mobile phone
excellent but I don't just want that

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319
excellent but I don't just want that
 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:13.760
excellent but I don't just want that
because I

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770
because I
 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.560
because I
super lazy I also want widgets I want to

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570
super lazy I also want widgets I want to
 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.660
super lazy I also want widgets I want to
be able to see the weather immediately

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670
be able to see the weather immediately
 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.520
be able to see the weather immediately
when i unlock my phone in fact I want to

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530
when i unlock my phone in fact I want to
 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.440
when i unlock my phone in fact I want to
go a step further and say maybe there's

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450
go a step further and say maybe there's
 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.120
go a step further and say maybe there's
a Casey for some rich notifications

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130
a Casey for some rich notifications
 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:24.500
a Casey for some rich notifications
something we should you know has a

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510
something we should you know has a
 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.380
something we should you know has a
little Sun or cloud or whatever else

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390
little Sun or cloud or whatever else
 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:28.760
little Sun or cloud or whatever else
it's a really good example of where you

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770
it's a really good example of where you
 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.130
it's a really good example of where you
might want to use a low priority

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140
might want to use a low priority
 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.330
might want to use a low priority
notification so it doesn't pop up it

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340
notification so it doesn't pop up it
 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:33.800
notification so it doesn't pop up it
doesn't ping me but when I pull down the

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810
doesn't ping me but when I pull down the
 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.510
doesn't ping me but when I pull down the
slide I've got that extra information

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520
slide I've got that extra information
 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.730
slide I've got that extra information
handy although I didn't mind knowing

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740
handy although I didn't mind knowing
 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.070
handy although I didn't mind knowing
what the temperature is at all times

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080
what the temperature is at all times
 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.170
what the temperature is at all times
this is my notification bar I thought

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180
this is my notification bar I thought
 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.330
this is my notification bar I thought
that was kind of a cool feature but of

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340
that was kind of a cool feature but of
 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.600
that was kind of a cool feature but of
course none of this is gonna be any good

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610
course none of this is gonna be any good
 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.220
course none of this is gonna be any good
if your battery runs down all the time

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230
if your battery runs down all the time
 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.470
if your battery runs down all the time
and so we're gonna go ahead and beat

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480
and so we're gonna go ahead and beat
 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.380
and so we're gonna go ahead and beat
this dead horse one more time I all of

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390
this dead horse one more time I all of
 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.570
this dead horse one more time I all of
these things depend on efficient

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580
these things depend on efficient
 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.450
these things depend on efficient
background updates that are done in a

00:02:59.450 --> 00:02:59.460
background updates that are done in a
 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:01.400
background updates that are done in a
way that won't drain your battery this

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410
way that won't drain your battery this
 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.140
way that won't drain your battery this
is actually another really good tip here

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150
is actually another really good tip here
 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.310
is actually another really good tip here
is that if you do want to do your

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320
is that if you do want to do your
 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:05.810
is that if you do want to do your
updates say that you know that the new

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820
updates say that you know that the new
 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.360
updates say that you know that the new
weather forecast comes in once a day so

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:16.410
familiar
 

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:19.240
familiar
not just the rounded corners but that a

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:19.250
not just the rounded corners but that a
 

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:22.250
not just the rounded corners but that a
little swash of color like a reflection

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:22.260
little swash of color like a reflection
 

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.650
little swash of color like a reflection
across the top that's it's um I've seen

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:24.660
across the top that's it's um I've seen
 

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:26.330
across the top that's it's um I've seen
that before and it wasn't on Android

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:26.340
that before and it wasn't on Android
 

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:27.800
that before and it wasn't on Android
yeah it's an interesting opportunity

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:27.810
yeah it's an interesting opportunity
 

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:29.060
yeah it's an interesting opportunity
here because again what we're looking

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:29.070
here because again what we're looking
 

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:31.399
here because again what we're looking
for is is a unique silhouette something

00:06:31.399 --> 00:06:31.409
for is is a unique silhouette something
 

00:06:31.409 --> 00:06:31.940
for is is a unique silhouette something
which really

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:31.950
which really
 

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:34.010
which really
stands out and looks great so there's

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:34.020
stands out and looks great so there's
 

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:35.150
stands out and looks great so there's
some sort of treatment here that just

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:35.160
some sort of treatment here that just
 

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:38.510
some sort of treatment here that just
removes the box as a first step and just

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:38.520
removes the box as a first step and just
 

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:41.150
removes the box as a first step and just
has the four the four raindrops will be

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:41.160
has the four the four raindrops will be
 

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:42.350
has the four the four raindrops will be
an interesting place to start

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:42.360
an interesting place to start
 

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:44.900
an interesting place to start
absolutely so let's uh let's move on

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:44.910
absolutely so let's uh let's move on
 

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:45.980
absolutely so let's uh let's move on
let's so let's have a look at the app

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:45.990
let's so let's have a look at the app
 

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:47.420
let's so let's have a look at the app
itself so we're gonna bring it up the

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:47.430
itself so we're gonna bring it up the
 

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:51.020
itself so we're gonna bring it up the
giant phone phone guide phone there we

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:51.030
giant phone phone guide phone there we
 

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:54.010
giant phone phone guide phone there we
go all right let's let's pull the app up

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:54.020
go all right let's let's pull the app up
 

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:58.820
go all right let's let's pull the app up
now there's a there's a EULA at the

00:06:58.820 --> 00:06:58.830
now there's a there's a EULA at the
 

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:01.600
now there's a there's a EULA at the
beginning which is unsurprising and then

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:01.610
beginning which is unsurprising and then
 

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:07.580
beginning which is unsurprising and then
there is a page of text which I took me

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:07.590
there is a page of text which I took me
 

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:09.530
there is a page of text which I took me
quite some time to get past it and to

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:09.540
quite some time to get past it and to
 

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:13.670
quite some time to get past it and to
understand not just well not just to

00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:13.680
understand not just well not just to
 

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:15.080
understand not just well not just to
read it but to actually figure out how

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:15.090
read it but to actually figure out how
 

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:16.490
read it but to actually figure out how
to discuss it it's like you're looking

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:16.500
to discuss it it's like you're looking
 

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:18.110
to discuss it it's like you're looking
here and it's like okay so this is a the

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:18.120
here and it's like okay so this is a the
 

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:19.910
here and it's like okay so this is a the
wizard where's the okay button how do I

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:19.920
wizard where's the okay button how do I
 

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:22.820
wizard where's the okay button how do I
so we're gonna do a huge favor for all

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:22.830
so we're gonna do a huge favor for all
 

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:25.850
so we're gonna do a huge favor for all
of our viewers and show you how to get

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:25.860
of our viewers and show you how to get
 

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:29.660
of our viewers and show you how to get
to the second page of this weather bomb

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:29.670
to the second page of this weather bomb
 

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:31.670
to the second page of this weather bomb
app and that is to hit the refresh

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:31.680
app and that is to hit the refresh
 

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:34.910
app and that is to hit the refresh
button which shouldn't be there anyway

00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:34.920
button which shouldn't be there anyway
 

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:36.470
button which shouldn't be there anyway
yeah and that's it's an interesting

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:36.480
yeah and that's it's an interesting
 

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:37.850
yeah and that's it's an interesting
implementation he actually had a

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:37.860
implementation he actually had a
 

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:39.470
implementation he actually had a
countdown built into the refresh button

00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:39.480
countdown built into the refresh button
 

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:43.100
countdown built into the refresh button
which is interesting but really we're

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:43.110
which is interesting but really we're
 

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:44.900
which is interesting but really we're
trying to get to a point now with app

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:44.910
trying to get to a point now with app
 

00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:46.550
trying to get to a point now with app
design where we can sort of banish the

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:46.560
design where we can sort of banish the
 

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:48.590
design where we can sort of banish the
refresh button a lot of users are still

00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:48.600
refresh button a lot of users are still
 

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:50.060
refresh button a lot of users are still
gonna want to quit for things like

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:50.070
gonna want to quit for things like
 

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:51.620
gonna want to quit for things like
weather or email where they're like

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:51.630
weather or email where they're like
 

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:53.210
weather or email where they're like
seriously I want to have up to the

00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:53.220
seriously I want to have up to the
 

00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:55.460
seriously I want to have up to the
second but that's a good thing to put in

00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:55.470
second but that's a good thing to put in
 

00:07:55.470 --> 00:07:57.080
second but that's a good thing to put in
something like an overflow menu so that

00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:57.090
something like an overflow menu so that
 

00:07:57.090 --> 00:07:58.700
something like an overflow menu so that
it is there for people who want it but

00:07:58.700 --> 00:07:58.710
it is there for people who want it but
 

00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:01.520
it is there for people who want it but
ideally no one does everything just

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:01.530
ideally no one does everything just
 

00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:03.350
ideally no one does everything just
refreshes and does everything for you in

00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:03.360
refreshes and does everything for you in
 

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:05.390
refreshes and does everything for you in
an app like this there is that you are

00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:05.400
an app like this there is that you are
 

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:07.340
an app like this there is that you are
at the beginning which is gonna take

00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:07.350
at the beginning which is gonna take
 

00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:08.780
at the beginning which is gonna take
some time for someone to at least look

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:08.790
some time for someone to at least look
 

00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:10.430
some time for someone to at least look
at and dismiss if not read through

00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:10.440
at and dismiss if not read through
 

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:11.960
at and dismiss if not read through
that's a great time to do that

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:11.970
that's a great time to do that
 

00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:13.820
that's a great time to do that
pre-caching it only took a few seconds

00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:13.830
pre-caching it only took a few seconds
 

00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:15.700
pre-caching it only took a few seconds
to bring that first page of information

00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:15.710
to bring that first page of information
 

00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:18.290
to bring that first page of information
when someone downloads and opens your

00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:18.300
when someone downloads and opens your
 

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:20.660
when someone downloads and opens your
app for the first time if they hit the

00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:20.670
app for the first time if they hit the
 

00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:23.810
app for the first time if they hit the
the icon by pastor EULA and this is the

00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:23.820
the icon by pastor EULA and this is the
 

00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:26.060
the icon by pastor EULA and this is the
first thing that they see this is pretty

00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:26.070
first thing that they see this is pretty
 

00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:28.040
first thing that they see this is pretty
compelling it really is a great page

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:28.050
compelling it really is a great page
 

00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:29.960

00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:35.300
know it's it's something you want to get
to the awesomeness of your app as

00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:35.310
to the awesomeness of your app as
 

00:08:35.310 --> 00:08:36.890
to the awesomeness of your app as
quickly as possible and this looks

00:08:36.890 --> 00:08:36.900
quickly as possible and this looks
 

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:38.990

awesome the previous page looked again a
 

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.820
awesome the previous page looked again a
little amateurish yeah I don't know if

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:40.830
little amateurish yeah I don't know if
 

00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:42.290
little amateurish yeah I don't know if
the author of this app is running

00:08:42.290 --> 00:08:42.300
the author of this app is running
 

00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:44.180
the author of this app is running
analytics but it'd be fascinating to

00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:44.190
analytics but it'd be fascinating to
 

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:45.800
analytics but it'd be fascinating to
see just how much abandonment there is

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:45.810
see just how much abandonment there is
 

00:08:45.810 --> 00:08:47.660
see just how much abandonment there is
so what is the drill first page I know I

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:47.670
so what is the drill first page I know I
 

00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:49.430
so what is the drill first page I know I
probably wouldn't have gone through with

00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:49.440
probably wouldn't have gone through with
 

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:52.340
probably wouldn't have gone through with
it if it wasn't my job to do so yeah

00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:52.350
it if it wasn't my job to do so yeah
 

00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:54.470
it if it wasn't my job to do so yeah
which is not a ringing endorsement the

00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:54.480
which is not a ringing endorsement the
 

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:58.130
which is not a ringing endorsement the
app itself did reward my patience richly

00:08:58.130 --> 00:08:58.140
app itself did reward my patience richly
 

00:08:58.140 --> 00:08:59.870
app itself did reward my patience richly
yeah now this looks this looks really

00:08:59.870 --> 00:08:59.880
yeah now this looks this looks really
 

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:01.430
yeah now this looks this looks really
nice we were talking about the nice to

00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:01.440
nice we were talking about the nice to
 

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:03.560
nice we were talking about the nice to
have I mean they've got a map here at

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:03.570
have I mean they've got a map here at
 

00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:05.600
have I mean they've got a map here at
the at the start and it seems if I drag

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:05.610
the at the start and it seems if I drag
 

00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:07.280
the at the start and it seems if I drag
left or right it's going to go through

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:07.290
left or right it's going to go through
 

00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:09.650
left or right it's going to go through
the time and show the show this

00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:09.660
the time and show the show this
 

00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:11.780
the time and show the show this
real-time map of satellite I guess it's

00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:11.790
real-time map of satellite I guess it's
 

00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:17.930
real-time map of satellite I guess it's
rainfall coverage you can actually rain

00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:17.940
rainfall coverage you can actually rain
 

00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:21.170
rainfall coverage you can actually rain
we've got wind which is always nice to

00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:21.180
we've got wind which is always nice to
 

00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:25.390
we've got wind which is always nice to
know in this area unsurprising nope yeah

00:09:25.390 --> 00:09:25.400
know in this area unsurprising nope yeah
 

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:27.800
know in this area unsurprising nope yeah
no the only thing that bugged me about

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:27.810
no the only thing that bugged me about
 

00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:29.330
no the only thing that bugged me about
this map actually was that I had to

00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:29.340
this map actually was that I had to
 

00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:33.400
this map actually was that I had to
pinch to zoom on a reasonably small area

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:33.410
pinch to zoom on a reasonably small area
 

00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:37.250
pinch to zoom on a reasonably small area
in this case where I know exactly where

00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:37.260
in this case where I know exactly where
 

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.410
in this case where I know exactly where
I want to zoom to I really prefer the

00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:39.420
I want to zoom to I really prefer the
 

00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:41.030
I want to zoom to I really prefer the
double tap to zoom and it doesn't

00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:41.040
double tap to zoom and it doesn't
 

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:43.820
double tap to zoom and it doesn't
support that and wasn't sure why so this

00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:43.830
support that and wasn't sure why so this
 

00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:47.660
support that and wasn't sure why so this
looks like I wonder if this is a the

00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:47.670
looks like I wonder if this is a the
 

00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:49.010
looks like I wonder if this is a the
Android map library that they've used

00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:49.020
Android map library that they've used
 

00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:51.320
Android map library that they've used
here if they've got something customer

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:51.330
here if they've got something customer
 

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:53.060
here if they've got something customer
they actually will see later that it is

00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:53.070
they actually will see later that it is
 

00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:54.920
they actually will see later that it is
not the Android we've done some

00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:54.930
not the Android we've done some
 

00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:56.300
not the Android we've done some
investigation excellent alright well

00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:56.310
investigation excellent alright well
 

00:09:56.310 --> 00:09:58.010
investigation excellent alright well
we'll look into that but certainly the

00:09:58.010 --> 00:09:58.020
we'll look into that but certainly the
 

00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:00.470
we'll look into that but certainly the
functionality here is is fantastic it is

00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:00.480
functionality here is is fantastic it is
 

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:04.850
functionality here is is fantastic it is
a very busy screen which is worth noting

00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:04.860
a very busy screen which is worth noting
 

00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:06.920
a very busy screen which is worth noting
and in fact the killer feature here is

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:06.930
and in fact the killer feature here is
 

00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:09.320
and in fact the killer feature here is
really this map which is front and

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:09.330
really this map which is front and
 

00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:11.540
really this map which is front and
center but once you have the the notes

00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:11.550
center but once you have the the notes
 

00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:13.430
center but once you have the the notes
on the bottom and the the various stuff

00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:13.440
on the bottom and the the various stuff
 

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:14.870
on the bottom and the the various stuff
on top you know we've got a lot of

00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:14.880
on top you know we've got a lot of
 

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:19.070
on top you know we've got a lot of
content yes miss the note but yeah I

00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:19.080
content yes miss the note but yeah I
 

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:21.800
content yes miss the note but yeah I
agree completely that you've got some

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:21.810
agree completely that you've got some
 

00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:26.420
agree completely that you've got some
real problems crowding the screen and

00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:26.430
real problems crowding the screen and
 

00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:28.550
real problems crowding the screen and
some of these things you know are sort

00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:28.560
some of these things you know are sort
 

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:30.620
some of these things you know are sort
of nice to have like maybe you really do

00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:30.630
of nice to have like maybe you really do
 

00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:33.950
of nice to have like maybe you really do
want us to have the graph but the graph

00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:33.960
want us to have the graph but the graph
 

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:35.570
want us to have the graph but the graph
is redundant the graph up here is really

00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:35.580
is redundant the graph up here is really
 

00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:36.380
is redundant the graph up here is really
redundant

00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:36.390
redundant
 

00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:38.840
redundant
we have you've got that the with the

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:38.850
we have you've got that the with the
 

00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:40.730
we have you've got that the with the
time map so it seems like you could have

00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:40.740
time map so it seems like you could have
 

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:42.740
time map so it seems like you could have
one or the other exactly at least just

00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:42.750
one or the other exactly at least just
 

00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:45.290
one or the other exactly at least just
give you an option to view exactly some

00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:45.300
give you an option to view exactly some
 

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:47.660
give you an option to view exactly some
way to swipe to dismiss or to collapse

00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:47.670
way to swipe to dismiss or to collapse
 

00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:49.130
way to swipe to dismiss or to collapse
or something like that so that you can

00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:49.140
or something like that so that you can
 

00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:51.950
or something like that so that you can
really enjoy you know this you know

00:10:51.950 --> 00:10:51.960
really enjoy you know this you know
 

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:54.530
really enjoy you know this you know
really engaging you know interactive

00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:54.540
really engaging you know interactive
 

00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:56.319
really engaging you know interactive
interaction model yeah

00:10:56.319 --> 00:10:56.329
interaction model yeah
 

00:10:56.329 --> 00:10:57.910
interaction model yeah
I was also I was happy that it's very

00:10:57.910 --> 00:10:57.920
I was also I was happy that it's very
 

00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:00.100
I was also I was happy that it's very
easy to drop down and picks locations

00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:00.110
easy to drop down and picks locations
 

00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:02.679
easy to drop down and picks locations
hmm but it's relatively difficult to add

00:11:02.679 --> 00:11:02.689
hmm but it's relatively difficult to add
 

00:11:02.689 --> 00:11:04.840
hmm but it's relatively difficult to add
new locations I was really hoping that I

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:04.850
new locations I was really hoping that I
 

00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:06.910
new locations I was really hoping that I
could just do something with this map

00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:06.920
could just do something with this map
 

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:10.600
could just do something with this map
add a location instead there's a little

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:10.610
add a location instead there's a little
 

00:11:10.610 --> 00:11:13.840
add a location instead there's a little
harder go to this other page then I've

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:13.850
harder go to this other page then I've
 

00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:16.179
harder go to this other page then I've
got to hit plus and then I'm gonna do a

00:11:16.179 --> 00:11:16.189
got to hit plus and then I'm gonna do a
 

00:11:16.189 --> 00:11:21.220
got to hit plus and then I'm gonna do a
lot long now I think if I know I I don't

00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:21.230
lot long now I think if I know I I don't
 

00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:23.289
lot long now I think if I know I I don't
know how to get to a map I don't think

00:11:23.289 --> 00:11:23.299
know how to get to a map I don't think
 

00:11:23.299 --> 00:11:24.489
know how to get to a map I don't think
you can I think you can search for

00:11:24.489 --> 00:11:24.499
you can I think you can search for
 

00:11:24.499 --> 00:11:26.079
you can I think you can search for
places but you can't pick off a map and

00:11:26.079 --> 00:11:26.089
places but you can't pick off a map and
 

00:11:26.089 --> 00:11:28.809
places but you can't pick off a map and
that would be a really interesting you

00:11:28.809 --> 00:11:28.819
that would be a really interesting you
 

00:11:28.819 --> 00:11:31.389
that would be a really interesting you
know view to just allow you to just go

00:11:31.389 --> 00:11:31.399
know view to just allow you to just go
 

00:11:31.399 --> 00:11:33.699
know view to just allow you to just go
straight off the map yes it's time you

00:11:33.699 --> 00:11:33.709
straight off the map yes it's time you
 

00:11:33.709 --> 00:11:36.129
straight off the map yes it's time you
have a lot long you should be able to do

00:11:36.129 --> 00:11:36.139
have a lot long you should be able to do
 

00:11:36.139 --> 00:11:37.960
have a lot long you should be able to do
a map it's kind of like having a date

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:37.970
a map it's kind of like having a date
 

00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:39.460
a map it's kind of like having a date
you want to also have a calendar paper

00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:39.470
you want to also have a calendar paper
 

00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:41.109
you want to also have a calendar paper
than anything now so this is interesting

00:11:41.109 --> 00:11:41.119
than anything now so this is interesting
 

00:11:41.119 --> 00:11:42.699
than anything now so this is interesting
as well you'll note that every time now

00:11:42.699 --> 00:11:42.709
as well you'll note that every time now
 

00:11:42.709 --> 00:11:44.859
as well you'll note that every time now
that we've added a new location we get

00:11:44.859 --> 00:11:44.869
that we've added a new location we get
 

00:11:44.869 --> 00:11:47.829
that we've added a new location we get
that same start up screen again so again

00:11:47.829 --> 00:11:47.839
that same start up screen again so again
 

00:11:47.839 --> 00:11:49.299
that same start up screen again so again
really here we don't we don't need the

00:11:49.299 --> 00:11:49.309
really here we don't we don't need the
 

00:11:49.309 --> 00:11:50.759
really here we don't we don't need the
extra instruction you should really be

00:11:50.759 --> 00:11:50.769
extra instruction you should really be
 

00:11:50.769 --> 00:11:52.749
extra instruction you should really be
initiating that sync as soon as I add

00:11:52.749 --> 00:11:52.759
initiating that sync as soon as I add
 

00:11:52.759 --> 00:11:54.249
initiating that sync as soon as I add
the new place on the expectation that

00:11:54.249 --> 00:11:54.259
the new place on the expectation that
 

00:11:54.259 --> 00:11:56.429
the new place on the expectation that
I'm going to switch to it at some point

00:11:56.429 --> 00:11:56.439
I'm going to switch to it at some point
 

00:11:56.439 --> 00:11:58.509
I'm going to switch to it at some point
otherwise you know it's really nicely

00:11:58.509 --> 00:11:58.519
otherwise you know it's really nicely
 

00:11:58.519 --> 00:12:00.789
otherwise you know it's really nicely
polished out again you may be under

00:12:00.789 --> 00:12:00.799
polished out again you may be under
 

00:12:00.799 --> 00:12:02.289
polished out again you may be under
playing some of the data it's really a

00:12:02.289 --> 00:12:02.299
playing some of the data it's really a
 

00:12:02.299 --> 00:12:03.879
playing some of the data it's really a
question here of what do you want to

00:12:03.879 --> 00:12:03.889
question here of what do you want to
 

00:12:03.889 --> 00:12:05.199
question here of what do you want to
emphasize what is the main thing you

00:12:05.199 --> 00:12:05.209
emphasize what is the main thing you
 

00:12:05.209 --> 00:12:06.699
emphasize what is the main thing you
want users to take away from here

00:12:06.699 --> 00:12:06.709
want users to take away from here
 

00:12:06.709 --> 00:12:08.319
want users to take away from here
because we have the temperature but it's

00:12:08.319 --> 00:12:08.329
because we have the temperature but it's
 

00:12:08.329 --> 00:12:10.629
because we have the temperature but it's
in light gray and it's absolutely tiny

00:12:10.629 --> 00:12:10.639
in light gray and it's absolutely tiny
 

00:12:10.639 --> 00:12:12.699
in light gray and it's absolutely tiny
at the top left here which is arguably

00:12:12.699 --> 00:12:12.709
at the top left here which is arguably
 

00:12:12.709 --> 00:12:14.319
at the top left here which is arguably
one of the more important things that

00:12:14.319 --> 00:12:14.329
one of the more important things that
 

00:12:14.329 --> 00:12:16.419
one of the more important things that
you're going to want to to share with

00:12:16.419 --> 00:12:16.429
you're going to want to to share with
 

00:12:16.429 --> 00:12:18.340
you're going to want to to share with
users so again just take that into

00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:18.350
users so again just take that into
 

00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:20.079
users so again just take that into
consideration what are people going to

00:12:20.079 --> 00:12:20.089
consideration what are people going to
 

00:12:20.089 --> 00:12:21.549
consideration what are people going to
want what are they going to want to do

00:12:21.549 --> 00:12:21.559
want what are they going to want to do
 

00:12:21.559 --> 00:12:22.989
want what are they going to want to do
and make it as easy as possible

00:12:22.989 --> 00:12:22.999
and make it as easy as possible
 

00:12:22.999 --> 00:12:24.400
and make it as easy as possible
now of course whether bombs still in

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:24.410
now of course whether bombs still in
 

00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:26.619
now of course whether bombs still in
beta yeah the author has mentioned that

00:12:26.619 --> 00:12:26.629
beta yeah the author has mentioned that
 

00:12:26.629 --> 00:12:27.999
beta yeah the author has mentioned that
he's got a lot of plans to add

00:12:27.999 --> 00:12:28.009
he's got a lot of plans to add
 

00:12:28.009 --> 00:12:31.960
he's got a lot of plans to add
outstanding things so I think that why

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:31.970
outstanding things so I think that why
 

00:12:31.970 --> 00:12:34.659
outstanding things so I think that why
don't we just ignore some of the basic

00:12:34.659 --> 00:12:34.669
don't we just ignore some of the basic
 

00:12:34.669 --> 00:12:36.489
don't we just ignore some of the basic
layout issues and focus on the fact that

00:12:36.489 --> 00:12:36.499
layout issues and focus on the fact that
 

00:12:36.499 --> 00:12:37.929
layout issues and focus on the fact that
the map is a really cool feature

00:12:37.929 --> 00:12:37.939
the map is a really cool feature
 

00:12:37.939 --> 00:12:39.579
the map is a really cool feature
definitely going to talk about it a

00:12:39.579 --> 00:12:39.589
definitely going to talk about it a
 

00:12:39.589 --> 00:12:41.199
definitely going to talk about it a
little bit later hmm

00:12:41.199 --> 00:12:41.209
little bit later hmm
 

00:12:41.209 --> 00:12:43.840
little bit later hmm
I cover it in more detail for now why

00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:43.850
I cover it in more detail for now why
 

00:12:43.850 --> 00:12:45.340
I cover it in more detail for now why
don't we go ahead and move on to eye in

00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:45.350
don't we go ahead and move on to eye in
 

00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:46.869
don't we go ahead and move on to eye in
the sky okay let's do that so yeah

00:12:46.869 --> 00:12:46.879
the sky okay let's do that so yeah
 

00:12:46.879 --> 00:12:49.119
the sky okay let's do that so yeah
nicely nicely done great to hear that

00:12:49.119 --> 00:12:49.129
nicely nicely done great to hear that
 

00:12:49.129 --> 00:12:49.629
nicely nicely done great to hear that
it's in beta

00:12:49.629 --> 00:12:49.639
it's in beta
 

00:12:49.639 --> 00:12:52.840

through a lot of these apps but again

00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:07.190
through a lot of these apps but again

through a lot of these apps but again
we've kind of got this squared off

00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:08.480
we've kind of got this squared off
 

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:12.069
we've kind of got this squared off
square icon which all it does is bound

00:15:12.069 --> 00:15:12.079

this really distinctive and interesting
silhouette so again I think you can get

00:15:15.309 --> 00:15:15.319
silhouette so again I think you can get
 

00:15:15.319 --> 00:15:17.079
silhouette so again I think you can get
a lot further in terms of creating that

00:15:17.079 --> 00:15:17.089
a lot further in terms of creating that
 

00:15:17.089 --> 00:15:19.449
a lot further in terms of creating that
really great app icon by just removing

00:15:19.449 --> 00:15:19.459
really great app icon by just removing
 

00:15:19.459 --> 00:15:23.530
really great app icon by just removing
that background so let's uh switch to

00:15:23.530 --> 00:15:23.540

00:26:04.550 --> 00:26:10.330
we don't have a ton of time but I'm just
gonna look a little bit over what what

00:26:10.330 --> 00:26:10.340
gonna look a little bit over what what
 

00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:13.180
gonna look a little bit over what what

this is ratos a time to you know move

00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:16.310
this is ratos a time to you know move

just be there okay there we go all right

00:26:20.490 --> 00:26:20.500
just be there okay there we go all right
 

00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:26.260
just be there okay there we go all right
we try and we try it okay now when you

00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:26.270
we try and we try it okay now when you
 

00:26:26.270 --> 00:26:28.630
we try and we try it okay now when you
open up GL trace view on this app the

00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:28.640
open up GL trace view on this app the
 

00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:32.430

frame over here that's actually

00:26:34.750 --> 00:26:34.760
frame over here that's actually
 

00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:36.790
frame over here that's actually
everything but the map and the reason is

00:26:36.790 --> 00:26:36.800
everything but the map and the reason is
 

00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:41.680
everything but the map and the reason is
that the frame is being drawn in in a GL

00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:41.690
that the frame is being drawn in in a GL
 

00:26:41.690 --> 00:26:43.690
that the frame is being drawn in in a GL
surface view and the way this works is

00:26:43.690 --> 00:26:43.700

00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:45.190
surface view and the way this works is
there is a windowing system in Android

the map now this area here is being
 

00:27:12.290 --> 00:27:14.050
the map now this area here is being
drawn in a second context so it's

00:27:14.050 --> 00:27:14.060
drawn in a second context so it's
 

00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:17.080
drawn in a second context so it's
important to set your context right up

00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:17.090
important to set your context right up
 

00:27:17.090 --> 00:27:19.270

there and so that's context one and

00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:22.850
there and so that's context one and

let's see how they draw the map so the

00:27:24.910 --> 00:27:24.920
let's see how they draw the map so the
 

00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:26.920
let's see how they draw the map so the
first draw call just draws the map and

00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:26.930
first draw call just draws the map and
 

00:27:26.930 --> 00:27:29.560
first draw call just draws the map and
you can see it's about six triangles I

00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:29.570
you can see it's about six triangles I
 

00:27:29.570 --> 00:27:30.910
you can see it's about six triangles I
don't even know why it's six could be

them but as I said a really minor point

them but as I said a really minor point
and the only reason I really bring it up

00:29:52.330 --> 00:29:52.340
and the only reason I really bring it up
 

00:29:52.340 --> 00:29:55.090
and the only reason I really bring it up
is because there's a lot of apps that

00:29:55.090 --> 00:29:55.100
is because there's a lot of apps that
 

00:29:55.100 --> 00:29:57.430
is because there's a lot of apps that
have significantly more overdraw than

have significantly more overdraw than

have significantly more overdraw than
this and still draw everything back to

this and still draw everything back to
 

00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:02.289
this and still draw everything back to
front and that's a real problem you want

front and that's a real problem you want
 

00:30:02.299 --> 00:30:03.909
front and that's a real problem you want
to draw front to back so that you can

00:30:03.909 --> 00:30:03.919
to draw front to back so that you can
 

00:30:03.919 --> 00:30:06.070
to draw front to back so that you can

well it's not actually the GPU now you

00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:15.090
well it's not actually the GPU now you
 

00:31:15.090 --> 00:31:16.430
well it's not actually the GPU now you
don't see it in this view because you

00:31:16.430 --> 00:31:16.440
don't see it in this view because you
 

00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:18.740
don't see it in this view because you
have to run systrace to see it but the

pixels now what's really eating up all

00:31:26.780 --> 00:31:26.790

that's just one call and it's not even

that's just one call and it's not even

that's just one call and it's not even

the one that touches the most pixels
 

00:31:44.970 --> 00:31:51.490

this is the call to draw the overlay so

00:31:51.490 --> 00:31:51.500
 
 

00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:53.450
 
what is it doing wrong

00:31:53.450 --> 00:31:53.460
what is it doing wrong
 

00:31:53.460 --> 00:31:57.800
what is it doing wrong
well the real problem is that it's not

00:31:57.800 --> 00:31:57.810
well the real problem is that it's not
 

00:31:57.810 --> 00:32:02.840
well the real problem is that it's not
just zooming it's not just drawing these

00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:02.850
just zooming it's not just drawing these
 

00:32:02.850 --> 00:32:05.810
just zooming it's not just drawing these
vertices it's also mem copying them and

00:32:05.810 --> 00:32:05.820
vertices it's also mem copying them and
 

00:32:05.820 --> 00:32:07.730
vertices it's also mem copying them and
that's really where it come where things

00:32:07.730 --> 00:32:07.740
that's really where it come where things
 

00:32:07.740 --> 00:32:10.490
that's really where it come where things
get heavy so there's actually two arrays

00:32:10.490 --> 00:32:10.500

then they're being drawn using this GL

00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:15.210

probably the weather information itself

00:32:22.970 --> 00:32:22.980
probably the weather information itself
 

00:32:22.980 --> 00:32:24.380
probably the weather information itself
the bunch of integers they kind of

00:32:24.380 --> 00:32:24.390
the bunch of integers they kind of
 

00:32:24.390 --> 00:32:27.050
the bunch of integers they kind of
cluster in odd ways so that's probably

00:32:27.050 --> 00:32:27.060
cluster in odd ways so that's probably
 

00:32:27.060 --> 00:32:29.150
cluster in odd ways so that's probably
our weather information that's gonna

00:32:29.150 --> 00:32:29.160
our weather information that's gonna
 

00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:32.210
our weather information that's gonna
vary per frame maybe not enough to

00:32:32.210 --> 00:32:32.220
vary per frame maybe not enough to
 

00:32:32.220 --> 00:32:35.620
vary per frame maybe not enough to
justify redoing it every frame but yeah

00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:35.630
justify redoing it every frame but yeah
 

00:32:35.630 --> 00:32:38.540
justify redoing it every frame but yeah
but the next one which is even larger is

00:32:38.540 --> 00:32:38.550
but the next one which is even larger is
 

00:32:38.550 --> 00:32:42.590
but the next one which is even larger is
a bunch of floats that are probably

00:32:42.590 --> 00:32:42.600
a bunch of floats that are probably
 

00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:44.720
a bunch of floats that are probably
never gonna vary because these are all

00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:44.730
never gonna vary because these are all
 

00:32:44.730 --> 00:32:48.220
never gonna vary because these are all
the vertices that go into this mesh and

00:32:48.220 --> 00:32:48.230
the vertices that go into this mesh and
 

00:32:48.230 --> 00:32:51.560
the vertices that go into this mesh and
there's no real reason to change those

00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:51.570
there's no real reason to change those
 

00:32:51.570 --> 00:32:52.970
there's no real reason to change those
ever

00:32:52.970 --> 00:32:52.980
ever

even if you're zooming the map in and

00:32:55.490 --> 00:32:55.500
even if you're zooming the map in and
 

00:32:55.500 --> 00:32:57.530
even if you're zooming the map in and
out you can just change the projection

00:32:57.530 --> 00:32:57.540
out you can just change the projection
 

00:32:57.540 --> 00:32:59.900
out you can just change the projection
on those so why are we sending them

00:32:59.900 --> 00:32:59.910
on those so why are we sending them
 

00:32:59.910 --> 00:33:01.060
on those so why are we sending them
every frame

00:33:01.060 --> 00:33:01.070
every frame
 

00:33:01.070 --> 00:33:03.290

there's no reason those should go in a

00:33:03.290 --> 00:33:03.300
there's no reason those should go in a
 

00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:09.050
there's no reason those should go in a
vertex buffer object so I think we'll go

00:33:09.050 --> 00:33:09.060
vertex buffer object so I think we'll go
 

00:33:09.060 --> 00:33:11.780
vertex buffer object so I think we'll go
ahead and sum up now the there's nothing

00:33:11.780 --> 00:33:11.790
ahead and sum up now the there's nothing
 

00:33:11.790 --> 00:33:14.630
ahead and sum up now the there's nothing
wrong with this app but it's skirting

00:33:14.630 --> 00:33:14.640
wrong with this app but it's skirting
 

00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:17.720
wrong with this app but it's skirting
the edge of going from buttery to janky

00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:17.730
the edge of going from buttery to janky
 

00:33:17.730 --> 00:33:20.780
the edge of going from buttery to janky
and with just a few very very slight

00:33:20.780 --> 00:33:20.790
and with just a few very very slight
 

00:33:20.790 --> 00:33:24.290
and with just a few very very slight
changes it could be far into buttery

00:33:24.290 --> 00:33:24.300
changes it could be far into buttery
 

00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:28.060
changes it could be far into buttery
territory all right let's go ahead and

00:33:28.060 --> 00:33:28.070
territory all right let's go ahead and
 

00:33:28.070 --> 00:33:32.090
territory all right let's go ahead and
take a closer look at next today's apps

00:33:32.090 --> 00:33:32.100

already see that there's a little bit of
 

00:33:43.260 --> 00:33:44.780
already see that there's a little bit of
work needs to be done on a few of these

00:33:44.780 --> 00:33:44.790
work needs to be done on a few of these

at them on tablet so I'm hoping there's

a great tablet experience particularly

00:33:49.970 --> 00:33:49.980
a great tablet experience particularly
 

00:33:49.980 --> 00:33:51.380
