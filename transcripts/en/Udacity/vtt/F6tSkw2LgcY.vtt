00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:02.410
Hi, welcome to lesson two.

00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:04.780
In the first lesson, you learned what version control is and

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:07.120
how Git compares to other systems.

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:07.650
In this lesson,

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:11.790
you'll learn how to use Git on your own machine for solo projects.

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.870
You'll learn how to create a new repository and make commits.

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:18.520
You'll also learn what it means to merge and branch in Git and

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.490
how to use these tools to keep track of experimental changes to your project.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.390
Then in lesson three, we'll learn how to use Git collaboratively across multiple

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.350
machines using GitHub.

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:28.890
Let's get started.
