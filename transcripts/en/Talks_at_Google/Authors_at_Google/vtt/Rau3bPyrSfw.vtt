00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:08.850
&gt;&gt;Meng: Good afternoon my friends. Our guest
today is Chip Conley, someone I'm honored

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:18.949
to call my friend. Chip is the founder and
CEO and now Executive Chairman of Joie de

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:25.199
Vivre, I hope I pronounced it correctly. [chuckles]
Chinese, yeah Chinese guy you know. [chuckles]

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.869
California's largest boutique hotel company.

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:37.320
But Chip is no ordinary CEO. He combines brilliance
with wisdom and compassion in his work. Gavin

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:44.770
Newsom, the Lieutenant Governor of California
calls Chip "that rare breed of CEO who possesses

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:50.780
both a brilliant business mind and a very
big heart. He's a true role model for anyone

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:56.170
who wants to lead." And that's what Gavin
says about Chip.

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:07.430
Chip started his company in 1987 at the age
of 26 with no industry experience. He turned

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:14.289
a seedy motel into a world renowned hotel
that catered to celebrities such as David

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:22.479
Bowie. And Chip focuses on the higher human
needs of his employees, customers, and investors.

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:26.799
His company now consists of over 40 unique
and award winning hotels and spas and restaurants,

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:32.229
employing over 3,000 people. It has been named
the second best place to work in the San Francisco

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:39.070
Bay area -- I wonder what number one is? [laughs]

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:40.070
[laughter]

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:46.850
with employee turnover rate at one-third the
industry average. Chip has also been honored

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:55.869
with top hospitality industry awards and in
2007, he was named the Bay Area's most innovative

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:56.869
CEO.

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:00.619
And my friends please give a warm welcome
to Chip Conley.

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:01.639
[applause]

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:05.739
&gt;&gt;Chip Conley: [clears throat]

00:02:05.739 --> 00:02:09.849
[sound of papers shuffling]

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:15.680
What Meng didn't tell you is that he and I
are going down to the Esalen Institute next

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.870
week to be involved in a Conscious Capitalism
Conference that John Mackey from Whole Foods

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.069
Markets is putting on, the guy that founded
and CEO. So we're gonna be hangin' out naked

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:31.591
in the natural hot springs overlooking the
water next week so I figured I tell ya that.

00:02:31.591 --> 00:02:34.310
[laughs] I'm going to very transparent today.

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:35.770
[laughter]

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:40.450
For those of you who were thinking you are
coming to a business lecture, let me set you

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:49.380
straight. This is a psychology lecture today
so I'm gonna actually, oh she's excited [laughs].

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:54.739
It's gonna be a combination of business and
psychology because frankly, from my perspective,

00:02:54.739 --> 00:03:00.920
the most neglected fact in business is that
we're all human. And so one of the things

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:06.379
I've learned in the 24 years that I have had
my company, I went to Stanford undergrad,

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:11.510
I went directly into Stanford Business School,
graduated at age 23 from the Stanford Business

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.159
School and started my company about two or
three years later.

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:21.049
But 24 years [laughs] into doing this, the
number one thing I've learned about business

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:27.189
is that if you wanna be successful in business
in the long run, especially the higher you

00:03:27.189 --> 00:03:33.090
go up in the organization, the more you really
have to understand humans. And yet we have

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.879
operating manuals for our computers and our
cars and our, for those who still use them,

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:44.780
our VCR's [chuckles] but we aren't really
issued an operating manual for humans.

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:51.470
What I'm gonna talk about today is my operating
manual for humans in the context of work and

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.609
I hope you'll enjoy it. So let's get started.

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:58.609
And I'm gonna start philosophically by saying
that I actually believe that life and business

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:02.900
is all about where you pay your attention.
If you look at the wisdom traditions of the

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:09.590
religious, well known religious traditions,
spiritual traditions, quite often what they

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:13.420
speak to is the idea of where are you paying
your attention?

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:20.959
You're gonna see a lot of pyramids today and
this is not in solidarity with Egypt -- this

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:25.020
is actually [laughs]-- the pyramids are really
in solidarity with Abraham Maslow's hierarchy

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.819
of needs which is a theory of human psychology
and the human condition.

00:04:29.819 --> 00:04:36.090
And you'll see that as I talk about the idea
of where we are on the pyramid, a lot of it

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:42.310
will come back to where are you paying your
attention on the pyramid. So as you hear my

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:46.639
talk today and, as we have a conversation,
there'll be a lot of time for questions and

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:51.250
answers at the end, I really want you to think
about that is where are you paying your attention

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.190
on the pyramid?

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:56.380
This is three different people having three
different kinds of days. I don't know which

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:59.750
kind a day you're having today. How many of
you are having that kind of day? Anybody having

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:05.321
that kind of day? Okay, good, well few of
you. And then that's another guy in the middle

00:05:05.321 --> 00:05:09.949
and then there's the woman at the top who's
having, Meng has those days every day. I don't

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:12.000
know how he does it.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.660
But the fact is that in the course of any
one day, you may be anywhere on this pyramid.

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:21.360
In the course of an hour you may toggle up
and down this pyramid. But I think that's

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.020
true of companies too.

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:28.050
This is three companies in an industry that
is very troubled, [chuckles] has always been

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:33.020
troubled. The airline industry seems to just
toggle between success and failure pretty

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:37.750
quickly. One of these three companies has
been at the top of their game for 40 years,

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:42.330
Southwest Airlines. The other two are frankly
now combined. This is an old slide before

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:44.460
they actually had their merger.

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:50.419
But what is true of people, what is true of
us in terms of where we fit on this pyramid

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:56.729
is true of companies because guess what -- companies
are full of people. So each of us in our work

00:05:56.729 --> 00:06:00.440
has one of three relationships with our work
and there's really only three choices and

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:05.650
this is them. You either have a job, a career,
or a calling. But putting them in the context

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:11.039
of a pyramid helps us to understand how few
of us, frankly, in the course of our work,

00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:12.340
are living a calling.

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:17.419
And there's statistical evidence to show that
in fact about 60 to 70 percent of Americans

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:23.250
think of their work as a job. In the last
chapter of the book, Chapter 14, there's actually

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:27.949
a 15 question test you can take to understand
whether you have a job, a career, or a calling.

00:06:27.949 --> 00:06:34.310
But about 60 to 70 percent of Americans actually
think of their work as a job. About 20 to

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:39.441
30 percent think of their work as a career
and about, depending upon how you look at

00:06:39.441 --> 00:06:43.960
it, five to ten percent, five to fifteen percent
think of it as a calling.

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:48.800
I'll come back to this. But what -- I wanna
tell you a quick story related to this because

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:55.531
one of my basic premises about leadership
and about psychology in business comes from

00:06:55.531 --> 00:07:00.140
the idea that the best companies out there
and the best leaders out there help their

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:02.550
employees move up this pyramid.

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:08.870
So I was taking a flight from, let's see where
was I, I was in Austin, Texas, I was actually

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:13.490
at this Conscious Capitalism Conference in
Austin that John Mackey had put on in November

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:19.039
of 2008 and I was flying to Dallas and I was
flying on Southwest Airlines. And there was

00:07:19.039 --> 00:07:23.490
a guy handing out peanuts and he was not a
flight attendant, handing out peanuts to everybody

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:27.240
on the plane. And I looked at him like, "Who
is this guy? Why would he be doing that?"

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:31.819
And then I looked at my Southwest Spirit Magazine
and I saw that is the CEO of the company.

00:07:31.819 --> 00:07:37.470
It's not Herb Kelleher who was the sort of
famous CEO of Southwest for 37 years, he's

00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:43.430
retired. It was a guy named Gary Kelly who's
the relatively new CEO of Southwest handing

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:44.430
out peanuts.

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:49.200
He gets to the back of the plane and I corner
him because no one's talking to him and so

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:53.509
I say -- and our company Joie de Vivre has
had a long history with Southwest doing marketing

00:07:53.509 --> 00:07:59.580
together -- so I said to him, this is November
of 2008 and if you'll remember, in 2008, the

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:05.000
first half of 2008, three years ago, there
was a robust worldwide economy. I know that

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.690
sounds amazing. I mean it wasn't that long
ago. And part of the reason we know it was

00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:17.210
robust was because fuel prices and gas prices
skyrocketed. In fact, in the summer of 2008,

00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:21.659
the Presidential election, it was an issue,
the fact that gas prices were as high as they

00:08:21.659 --> 00:08:27.169
were. Well, with jet fuel prices going up
in the summer of 2008, most of the airlines

00:08:27.169 --> 00:08:31.240
in America started charging for things that
they didn't use to charge for. Like what?

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:32.930
&gt;&gt;voice in audience: [inaudible]

00:08:32.930 --> 00:08:35.490
&gt;&gt;Chip Conley: Bags, luggage. What else?

00:08:35.490 --> 00:08:36.490
&gt;&gt;male #1: Meals.

00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:41.231
&gt;&gt;Chip Conley: Meals, blankets, pillows, headphones.
What's that?

00:08:41.231 --> 00:08:42.280
&gt;&gt;male #2: Oxygen.

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:48.340
&gt;&gt;Chip Conley: Oxygen. Well actually getting
to basic needs, there was an airline in Europe,

00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:54.200
Ryanair, that actually came that close to
starting to charge for the bathrooms, the

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:59.720
toilets. They were gonna have pay operated
toilets on their plane. They finally got smart

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:02.460
and said, "Okay, let's not charge for that."

00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:06.670
Well Southwest Airlines was the only airline
in America that actually chose not to charge

00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:12.540
all those extra fees. So I asked him, I asked
the CEO of Southwest while we were on the

00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:16.920
plane, "Why is it that you haven't charged?"
And I thought the obvious answer was gonna

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:21.050
be, "Well our customers like our low prices
and we don't wanna upset our customers, and

00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:25.830
da, da, da." But instead he gave me a not
obvious answer that relates to this slide.

00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:30.780
He pointed to the flight attendants and he
said to me, "Have you ever noticed that the

00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:36.140
flight attendants on Southwest are having
a different kind of experience than the flight

00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:41.001
attendants on United?" [laughs] I said, "Yes,
in fact I fly out of San Francisco a lot.

00:09:41.001 --> 00:09:44.780
It's a United hub. The flight attendants on
United don't look like they're having as good

00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:50.660
of a time as your flight attendants." And
he said, "Did you notice things changed after

00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:56.650
they started charging for bags and what's
happened in the last few months?" I said,

00:09:56.650 --> 00:10:01.610
"Well in the last few months, it feels as
if the flight attendants have become baggage

00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:05.820
handlers because we're all now bringing all
of our bags on the plane because we don't

00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:11.850
wanna actually be charged for them. And actually
it means that there's this like drill where

00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:15.080
we all have to get our bags on the planes
fast because we have to get off the ground

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:20.730
fast." And who's taking the brunt of that
other than us as customers? It's the flight

00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:25.420
attendants. And what he said, Gary Kelly,
said to me, he said, "United Airlines when

00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:31.320
they made the decision to start charging for
bags gave no thought to what effect that would

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:37.670
have on the flight attendants. We, at Southwest,
when we make decisions one of the most important

00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:43.590
things we ask ourselves is 'How is it going
to effect the sense of relationship with work

00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:48.470
our key employees are gonna have especially
those that customer facing?'" And then he

00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:54.640
said the following, he said, "If we get our
job right what we do is we help our flight

00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:59.292
attendants live their calling." Now I'd never
thought of that and for the rest of my flight

00:10:59.292 --> 00:11:01.960
I was sort of watching the flight attendants
and saying, "How are they living their calling?"

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:03.430
[laughs]

00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:09.590
But his point was this: if you are looking
at creating a long term, sustainable business

00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:16.520
model and creating an environment where your
employees are internally inspired by what

00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:20.790
they do, you help them move up this pyramid.
We'll come back to it, but it's a really profound

00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:25.270
point made by somebody other than me which
made me feel better.

00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:28.530
Let me tell you about my calling. I went to
Stanford undergrad, I went to Stanford Business

00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:32.520
School, I graduated, I was the youngest guy
in my class graduating from Stanford Business

00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:39.780
School, I was very ambitious, I wanted to
go out and like become Mr. Success. And I

00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:42.650
worked for Morgan Stanley between my first
and second year of business school in New

00:11:42.650 --> 00:11:46.310
York. I didn't like that. I didn't wanna be
an investment banker smoking cigars and wearing

00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:51.090
suspenders. That was just not me. And I wanted
to be a real estate developer, I wanted to

00:11:51.090 --> 00:11:55.140
do cool sort of progressive real estate development
projects.

00:11:55.140 --> 00:12:02.990
And so I decided to take a job out of Stanford
Business School earning $24,000 a year [laughs]

00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:09.170
I got paid one-third or one-fourth what the
other jobs were paying me but I really wanted

00:12:09.170 --> 00:12:14.760
to work for a developer in San Francisco that
would teach me the business and help me understand

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:18.220
how to do creative real estate development
in San Francisco.

00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:24.910
A year into that, at age 24, I realized I
hated what I was doing, [laughs] and I thought

00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:28.580
like I was the biggest idiot in my Stanford
Business School class because I didn't take

00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:33.700
the big money. I took a job out of Stanford
Business School paying me $2,000 a month.

00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:39.510
I was by far the lowest person graduating
out of my class, and I hated what I was doing.

00:12:39.510 --> 00:12:42.860
So that's when I actually went down to the
Esalen Institute and I started learning how

00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:46.540
to become a massage therapist. I was gonna
be the only Stanford MBA who became a massage

00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:49.850
therapist when he grew up, which is not a
bad thing since I found out today from Meng

00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:53.520
that you have 200 massage therapists on staff
here. So I maybe could have gotten a job at

00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:57.330
Google. [laughs] It's probably the only way
I would get a job at Google.

00:12:57.330 --> 00:13:06.880
But I actually decided on my 26th birthday
to start my own company. I call it "Joie de

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:13.480
Vivre" which is a very impractical name for
a company, hard to spell, hard to pronounce.

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:16.870
Most people in America don't know what it
means. Even if they did know what it means

00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:20.940
they wouldn't know how to live it. [laughs]
But it's about joy of life and I said that's

00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:26.070
what I was looking for. I want joy of life
for myself, I would like to create an environment

00:13:26.070 --> 00:13:32.060
where my employees have that, and I love to
provide that to our customers too.

00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:37.770
So the first, and as Meng said, I had no hotel
experience. I understand real estate development

00:13:37.770 --> 00:13:40.300
a little bit, but I didn't understand hotels.

00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:45.490
So I bought this motel in the Tenderloin in
San Francisco. Now I'm not from a wealthy

00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:51.410
family. Anybody from like Southern California
area at all? A few of you, so Long Beach Poly

00:13:51.410 --> 00:13:56.131
High School, so I mean this is, I was not
from Beverly Hills. I did not have a bunch

00:13:56.131 --> 00:13:59.990
of money in my pocket. So I went out and I
raised a million dollars from people I went

00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:04.370
to college and from business school with and
I bought a motel in San Francisco that was

00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:10.130
at the corner of Larkin and Eddy. We call
that the "Gateway to the Tenderloin" [laughs].

00:14:10.130 --> 00:14:14.920
I call it a good place to go for a run, not
for a walk. [laughs]

00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:15.920
[laughter]

00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:19.980
But also it was quite well known because it
was called the Caravan Lodge and the Caravan

00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:23.930
Lodge was the place that you walked into the
lobby and you saw the nightly rates posted

00:14:23.930 --> 00:14:29.110
$49 a night, and then in a slightly smaller
font in the lobby for everyone to see, it

00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:34.770
just said "$20 an hour". [laughs] It was a
pay by the hour motel, what we call a "no

00:14:34.770 --> 00:14:39.370
tell motel" where people went on their lunch
hour.

00:14:39.370 --> 00:14:45.740
So I bought it, had to get rid of Vinnie and
his girls, our biggest corporate account.

00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:46.740
[laughs]

00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:47.740
[laughter]

00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:53.990
And decided to create a Rock and Roll hotel.
And at age 26 the idea of having all these

00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:58.340
rock and rollers staying with me in my hotel
sounded like a cool idea. And who else was

00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:03.850
gonna stay at a broken down 1950s motel in
the ghetto? Did have bus parking, very important

00:15:03.850 --> 00:15:06.480
for [laughs] bands; they like the bus parking.

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:11.370
And the Phoenix, which is what I named it,
became sort of a hit pretty quickly and it

00:15:11.370 --> 00:15:17.410
still is. It's a funky place. A lot of the
people you see on the screen here started

00:15:17.410 --> 00:15:20.930
staying there and what it taught me pretty
quickly in the boutique hotel business is,

00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:23.860
it's not you are what you eat, it's you are
where you sleep.

00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:27.640
And let me explain that, you are where you
sleep 'cause this is actually something I

00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:30.650
started talking about 24 years ago and when
I started talking about this in the hotel

00:15:30.650 --> 00:15:36.270
business they thought I was absolutely nuts
and now it's like the way the world looks

00:15:36.270 --> 00:15:41.860
at things because we don't actually -- we
buy products that are a representation of

00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:49.730
ourselves. I mean that's just how we buy products.
And we buy them not so much based on our demographics

00:15:49.730 --> 00:15:51.380
but more based upon our psychographics.

00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:57.790
Let me explain what I mean. Every time we
create a hotel, we actually imagine a magazine

00:15:57.790 --> 00:16:02.210
that defines the personality of the hotel.
And the reason we do that is because it's

00:16:02.210 --> 00:16:10.320
a really helpful, holistic way of imagining
how to create a holistic product and a personality

00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:14.350
that we can all sort of understand what it
is.

00:16:14.350 --> 00:16:18.291
So that first hotel, the Phoenix, was based
upon Rolling Stone Magazine. We knew it was

00:16:18.291 --> 00:16:23.060
gonna be a rock and roll hotel, came up with
five adjectives that defined Rolling Stone:

00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:28.330
funky, irreverent, adventurous, cool, and
young at heart. And everything we did in creating

00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:32.470
the hotel -- from the art we chose to the
staff we chose -- we chose funky, irreverent

00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:37.312
staff, to the uniforms they wore or they didn't
wear because if they're funky and irreverent

00:16:37.312 --> 00:16:41.540
they never wore their uniforms. [laughs] So
to this kind of services and amenities we

00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:45.310
offered, it all had to come back to those
five adjectives.

00:16:45.310 --> 00:16:50.570
But the miracle in this was not that it helped
create a very interesting hotel. The miracle

00:16:50.570 --> 00:16:56.460
is about a year into it when I started to
see who were our biggest advocates, our evangelists,

00:16:56.460 --> 00:17:00.340
the people who were going out the telling
their friends about it, I started to realize

00:17:00.340 --> 00:17:06.470
that what was common about them was they would
use these five adjectives to describe themselves.

00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:12.552
So it was like the hotel was a mirror for
the aspirations of the customer. Does that

00:17:12.552 --> 00:17:13.552
make sense?

00:17:13.552 --> 00:17:18.750
So I call this "creating an identity refreshment".
If someone checks into the Phoenix and three

00:17:18.750 --> 00:17:23.350
days later they check out and they feel a
little bit more funky, irreverent, and adventurous,

00:17:23.350 --> 00:17:28.240
we have created more than just a lodging experience,
we have created an identity refreshment.

00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:33.120
Now the problem is if you are like my mom
and you're not funky, irreverent, or adventurous

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:37.629
[laughs], then we may have not created the
right identity refreshment for you. So that's

00:17:37.629 --> 00:17:41.320
why we have 35 different hotels. We're the
second largest boutique hotelier in the U.S.

00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:48.330
now. So I created a hotel for my mom which
was the Hotel Rex in the Union Square area

00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:54.030
based upon New Yorker Magazine. The five adjectives
were: clever, literate, artistic, worldly,

00:17:54.030 --> 00:17:55.710
and sophisticated.

00:17:55.710 --> 00:17:59.720
Then there is this hotel, that hotel up there.
Some of you actually may have even stayed

00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:05.080
there. Any of you ever stay at the Hotel Avante?
A few of you, yes. Well let me say Google

00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:07.270
should buy this hotel [laughs]

00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:08.289
[laughter]

00:18:08.289 --> 00:18:15.889
12,000 room nights a year. That hotel gets
12,000 room nights from Google every year.

00:18:15.889 --> 00:18:21.340
Do the math on a 91 room hotel, 365 days year.
You know that Google should buy the hotel

00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:24.080
because they pretty much, it's almost all
Google people there.

00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:25.080
[laughter]

00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:32.649
And there are other hotels closer to the Googleplex
here than the Avante. But why does Google

00:18:32.649 --> 00:18:37.080
put people up there? If you drive by it, I
mean it's not much to look at. It looks like

00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:41.464
some 1982 garden apartment building. But when
you go inside, it's got a little bit of a

00:18:41.464 --> 00:18:44.519
cool, I mean in the Valley I mean how many
interesting hotels are there? Not a whole

00:18:44.519 --> 00:18:47.899
lot. So it's more interesting than most hotels.

00:18:47.899 --> 00:18:52.470
But what we really found was -- in the year
2000 when we created this hotel, which was

00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:59.299
two years after you guys started, we decided
to use Wired Magazine. And if you wanna know

00:18:59.299 --> 00:19:05.440
the five adjectives we used to define Wired
-- we used to then to create the Avante they

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:14.620
were: smart, techie, creative, visionary,
and iconoclastic. Do those describe Google?

00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:15.620
Smart --

00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:16.620
[laughter]

00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:19.929
techie, creative, visionary, and iconoclastic.
We did that in the year 2000; we'd never heard

00:19:19.929 --> 00:19:25.149
of Google, we didn't know who Google was.
Luckily I have a handful of venture capitalist

00:19:25.149 --> 00:19:30.379
friends, private equity friends, who in 2001
said, "Look at this little company with the

00:19:30.379 --> 00:19:35.210
G in Mountain View. They would be a great
corporate account for your hotel." And we

00:19:35.210 --> 00:19:40.740
actually reached out to you in 2001, and you
started -- you as a company -- started using

00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:45.510
the hotel soon after that and there was a
great fit because the identity refreshment

00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:49.840
we were creating for Google visitors was a
good fit for how Google saw themselves.

00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:54.240
Then up in San Francisco, for those of you
who are occasionally up in San Francisco and

00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:58.149
at your office, we have a hotel right near
your office in San Francisco, the Hotel Vitale.

00:19:58.149 --> 00:20:03.700
Anybody ever been there or seen it, Americana
restaurant there too? This was a hotel that

00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:09.749
we opened six years ago and started the process
of trying to build it 13 years ago.

00:20:09.749 --> 00:20:14.120
What I believed was that there was a customer
out there who is what I would call post W,

00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:19.269
pre-Four Seasons. And what I mean by that
[laughs] is they've sort of outgrown the sort

00:20:19.269 --> 00:20:23.340
of narcissistic, hedonistic, you have to wear
black to walk through the lobby kind of boutique

00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:28.450
hotel. Have you ever been to one of those
before and felt maybe out of place? Well I

00:20:28.450 --> 00:20:29.740
do because I'm old. [laughs]

00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:34.080
But they weren't ready for their parents'
version of luxury if their parents even had

00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:38.950
a version of luxury. They didn't wanna like
old school, traditional luxury. And we call

00:20:38.950 --> 00:20:44.600
these people "bourgeois bohemians" or as David
Brooks called them "bo-bos". [laughs] So if

00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:47.399
you like the Hotel Vitale, you are a bo-bo
[laughs].

00:20:47.399 --> 00:20:53.480
So it was Dwell Magazine, a modern design
magazine meets Real Simple. The five adjectives

00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:59.429
were: fresh, natural, nurturing, modern, and
urbane. And since this hotel opened six years

00:20:59.429 --> 00:21:05.059
ago, by far off the charts the most successful
luxury hotel in San Francisco, in terms of

00:21:05.059 --> 00:21:10.830
occupancy rate 10 points higher than the Four
Seasons, The Ritz, The St. Regis, The Mandarin,

00:21:10.830 --> 00:21:12.210
The W.

00:21:12.210 --> 00:21:18.559
So by year 2000, we had 20 hotels. Let me
take a step back again. By year 2000, we had

00:21:18.559 --> 00:21:22.509
20 hotels around the Bay Area. We were the
largest hotelier in the Bay Area and all of

00:21:22.509 --> 00:21:26.899
our hotels were in the Bay Area. And that
was a great thing, in year 2000 to be the

00:21:26.899 --> 00:21:32.730
biggest Bay Area hotelier was quite a big
thing because that was -- the dot com boom

00:21:32.730 --> 00:21:37.870
was still, in the year 2000 it was sort of
just about to fall off, but it was still a

00:21:37.870 --> 00:21:40.190
pretty heady time.

00:21:40.190 --> 00:21:46.259
When people ask me -- I go and give talks
at Harvard Business School and Stanford Business

00:21:46.259 --> 00:21:50.450
School every year -- and they ask me to bring
my business model and show the business model,

00:21:50.450 --> 00:21:54.929
I bring them this and they all laugh and say,
"Oh no, show us your real business model."

00:21:54.929 --> 00:21:56.840
And I say, "No this is actually it."

00:21:56.840 --> 00:22:01.049
And let me explain this for a moment because
I think it really actually describes Google

00:22:01.049 --> 00:22:07.960
in a big way. This is based upon the premise
that, it actually goes back to a theory from

00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:12.519
the Harvard Business School called the Service
Profit Chain which was based upon the premise

00:22:12.519 --> 00:22:16.850
empirically, they were able to show, these
three Harvard Business School professors that

00:22:16.850 --> 00:22:21.630
service oriented companies that create a great
culture, a compelling culture that is far

00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:26.889
and away better than their competitors are
able to create happier, more engaged employees

00:22:26.889 --> 00:22:31.909
-- point number two on the heart -- which
leads to typically more loyal customers -- point

00:22:31.909 --> 00:22:35.820
number three on the heart -- which leads to
point number four on the heart, a profitable

00:22:35.820 --> 00:22:40.499
and sustainable business. So it's like a virtuous
circle.

00:22:40.499 --> 00:22:44.649
In 1997, when we were 10 years old as a company
and we had 13 hotels at that point and we

00:22:44.649 --> 00:22:49.649
were growing very fast, it was apparent to
me that if we were not gonna actually start

00:22:49.649 --> 00:22:53.960
investing in culture, and we had invested
in culture, but we needed to do it a lot more

00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:58.760
consciously. And so we brought in two executives
from Southwest Airlines, a company that we

00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:04.669
have modeled ourselves on at many times, and
we said for a three day retreat, "Teach us

00:23:04.669 --> 00:23:09.720
about Southwest." We bought a book called
"Nuts"; it's a book about Southwest's culture

00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:12.870
from 1997 so it's an old book at this point.

00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:18.419
And what we learned about Southwest is that
one of Southwest's number one competitive

00:23:18.419 --> 00:23:23.980
advantages is from a cultural perspective,
they were so much more successful in terms

00:23:23.980 --> 00:23:28.470
of the culture they created for their employees
and as they got bigger, their culture got

00:23:28.470 --> 00:23:34.039
stronger. Very important for Google 'cause
this is a very powerful culture here, but

00:23:34.039 --> 00:23:38.500
as Google gets bigger, how does the culture
get stronger? That's what we wanted to learn

00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:39.950
from Southwest.

00:23:39.950 --> 00:23:44.789
And ultimately, this is what we learned and
we put it in the form of a heart. Even though

00:23:44.789 --> 00:23:48.480
Southwest Airlines actually has a heart in
their logo and you know what their stock ticker

00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:55.730
symbol is? LUV, from Dallas no less, I mean,
like these Texans actually LUV, I mean would

00:23:55.730 --> 00:23:59.990
have, that's because of Love Field there,
but long story short is they didn't have,

00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:03.179
they'd never put the idea of this business
model in the form of a heart.

00:24:03.179 --> 00:24:08.309
We did that at Joie de Vivre partly because
at that point we had 1,000 employees or just

00:24:08.309 --> 00:24:11.220
under 1,000 employees and about half of them
have English as a second language and we just

00:24:11.220 --> 00:24:16.070
wanted to make sure that our housekeeping
staff who had never had, some of them had

00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:21.490
never had a formal education, could understand
the concept of our business model. So this

00:24:21.490 --> 00:24:22.730
was it.

00:24:22.730 --> 00:24:27.509
I call this Karmic capitalism because I think
what goes around comes around when it comes

00:24:27.509 --> 00:24:31.159
to business. Sometimes it takes a long time,
for like Bernie Madoff, it took a really long

00:24:31.159 --> 00:24:37.460
time. But I think this is very true that in
the long run, especially in a more transparent

00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:43.269
world -- which the Internet has allowed -- is
that Karmic capitalism can actually mean that

00:24:43.269 --> 00:24:46.679
the better things you're doing in the world
can come back to you as an organization, and

00:24:46.679 --> 00:24:50.140
that's what the heart really shows.

00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:55.559
Early in 2001, I should have been and we as
a company should have been in a really great

00:24:55.559 --> 00:25:00.649
place. I had a book come out that year with
-- Richard Branson wrote the forward to the

00:25:00.649 --> 00:25:05.110
book -- it was called, oops what did I do
there? It was called "The Rebel Rules: Daring

00:25:05.110 --> 00:25:06.629
to be Yourself in Business".

00:25:06.629 --> 00:25:11.530
But by early 2001 things started to look pretty
ugly here in the Bay Area. I don't know how

00:25:11.530 --> 00:25:16.529
many of you were here in the Bay Area working
at that time, but between 2001 and 2005, we

00:25:16.529 --> 00:25:22.590
all know the Bay Area suffered through a pretty
cataclysmic downturn especially here in the

00:25:22.590 --> 00:25:24.120
Valley.

00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:31.529
In fact between 2001 and 2005, Silicon Valley
hotels experienced a 53 percent drop in revenues

00:25:31.529 --> 00:25:37.330
on average. So imagine if your industry saw
a 53 percent drop in revenues for the industry

00:25:37.330 --> 00:25:42.389
for over a four year period, that's pretty
ugly. In San Francisco the drop was 35 percent

00:25:42.389 --> 00:25:46.639
over a four year period. And if you remember,
all of our hotels were here in the Bay Area.

00:25:46.639 --> 00:25:50.559
This is the worst percentage revenue drop
in the history of American hotels since World

00:25:50.559 --> 00:25:51.559
War II.

00:25:51.559 --> 00:25:56.659
So I went from bein' the guy on the left [chuckles]
to the guy on the right really, really quickly.

00:25:56.659 --> 00:26:01.840
And what I mean by that is -- previously it
looked like we were smart because we had all

00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:06.389
of our eggs in the Bay Area basket and quickly
it looked like we were in trouble. And we

00:26:06.389 --> 00:26:10.090
were also in trouble because of these guys.
You've all heard the expression "disruptive

00:26:10.090 --> 00:26:14.879
innovation." It's actually an expression that's
used quite often in the high tech world about

00:26:14.879 --> 00:26:23.179
how Netflix comes along and kills Blockbuster
and you see it in high tech more often than

00:26:23.179 --> 00:26:24.450
you do in our industry.

00:26:24.450 --> 00:26:29.769
I never expected to be disruptively innovated
but this is what's happened in 2001. Because

00:26:29.769 --> 00:26:36.480
in 2001, all of a sudden the way that actually
our customers booked our rooms changed and

00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:40.249
they started doing it all online and so there
was an intermediary, which if you're a boutique

00:26:40.249 --> 00:26:44.820
hotelier this commoditized approach to actually
booking your hotel room wasn't really the

00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:50.820
best way for our customers to understand whether
they were getting the right hotel. And guess

00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:57.010
how much we pay in commissions to Expedia?
We pay less now, but back then 2001 how much

00:26:57.010 --> 00:27:00.580
do you think we paid?

00:27:00.580 --> 00:27:01.580
[pause]

00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:04.159
&gt;&gt;voice in audience: [inaudible]

00:27:04.159 --> 00:27:05.600
&gt;&gt;Chip Conley: Higher.

00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:06.600
&gt;&gt;female in audience: [unintelligible]

00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:07.600
&gt;&gt;Chip Conley: Twenty percent, higher.

00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:08.600
&gt;&gt;female in audience: [unintelligible]

00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:10.720
&gt;&gt;Chip Conley: Now she's the negotiator whoever
she is [laughs].

00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:11.960
[laughter]

00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:13.200
[pause]

00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:15.159
Twenty-five percent.

00:27:15.159 --> 00:27:24.169
So if our average room rate in year 2000 was
$200 and, by 2002, it became $160 because

00:27:24.169 --> 00:27:30.919
the market fell apart. At $160, if we're paying
a 25 percent commission to Expedia and you

00:27:30.919 --> 00:27:39.650
booked on Expedia, we're only seeing $120.
So between this, the dot com bust, the Afghan

00:27:39.650 --> 00:27:44.190
war started about that point, and then we
became a fortress, 9/11, I forgot about 9/11,

00:27:44.190 --> 00:27:50.519
yeah. After 9/11 do people wanna jump on a
plane? No. Do people travel a lot? No. Then

00:27:50.519 --> 00:27:56.369
the economy soured. Did people wanna spend
money? No. Afghani war starts. We have a fortress

00:27:56.369 --> 00:28:02.119
America perspective, it's hard to immigrate
or even just to visit the U.S. from outside,

00:28:02.119 --> 00:28:09.720
SARS, SARS happened 2002, 2003. Ninety percent
drop in Asian travel over a 10 month period.

00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:16.070
The number one location that Asians travel
to in the U.S. as of that time was the Bay

00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:17.070
Area.

00:28:17.070 --> 00:28:22.600
So that stopped, and then what else happened?
Oh, oh, so we're named Joie de Vivre. Remember

00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:28.389
in 2003 the Iraqi War? Remember the Iraqi
War, during the Iraqi war we decided to go

00:28:28.389 --> 00:28:32.360
to war with Iraq and then there was one country
in the world that we went to war with politically

00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:37.539
or diplomatically and they're in Europe and
we started boycotting their products. Who?

00:28:37.539 --> 00:28:40.639
France. And we stopped eating French fries,
remember that, what do we call them?

00:28:40.639 --> 00:28:41.870
&gt;&gt;audience: Freedom fries.

00:28:41.870 --> 00:28:47.050
&gt;&gt;Chip Conley: So Americans started boycotting
French companies. What's the name of my company?

00:28:47.050 --> 00:28:48.129
[laughter]

00:28:48.129 --> 00:28:58.669
I was getting letters from [chuckles] Orange
County and Danville and [laughs] all these

00:28:58.669 --> 00:29:03.389
hotbeds of conservatism and they would write
me and say, "We're boycotting Joie de Vivre

00:29:03.389 --> 00:29:06.450
because we're boycotting all French companies."
And I would write them back and I'd say, "I'm

00:29:06.450 --> 00:29:10.519
sorry. We're not a French company. We're based
in San Francisco." And they would write back

00:29:10.519 --> 00:29:12.700
and they would say, "Oh that's worse." [laughs]

00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:13.700
[laughter]

00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:16.210
So like San Francisco's left of Paris.

00:29:16.210 --> 00:29:17.440
[laughter]

00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:22.919
So long story short, we were in trouble. We
had about 1,000 employees at that point; I

00:29:22.919 --> 00:29:26.600
didn't know how I was going to make payroll
in a couple months. And so I ended up in the

00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:30.330
Borders Bookstore at the corner of Post and
Powell at Union Square, around the corner

00:29:30.330 --> 00:29:35.350
from our office on a lunch hour looking for
a clue. I initially was looking for a business

00:29:35.350 --> 00:29:40.499
book, I was sort of going back to my business
roots as a business school MBA from Stanford

00:29:40.499 --> 00:29:43.539
and I said, "I wanna find a business book."
But within three minutes inside the bookstore

00:29:43.539 --> 00:29:47.779
[chuckles], I actually realized I didn't need
a business book I needed a self help book

00:29:47.779 --> 00:29:51.889
and so I ended up in the self help section
of the bookstore and I found a psychology

00:29:51.889 --> 00:29:55.159
book. I only took one psychology class in
college.

00:29:55.159 --> 00:29:59.009
Any of you ever go to Stanford, anybody go
to Stanford? There's a professor named Professor

00:29:59.009 --> 00:30:04.090
Zimbardo, sort of famous, and that was the
one class. I took Professor Zimbardo's Psychology

00:30:04.090 --> 00:30:09.330
101 class. The one thing I remembered from
my psychology class in college was Abraham

00:30:09.330 --> 00:30:14.929
Maslow because he had sort of a positive perspective
on the human condition as opposed to a negative

00:30:14.929 --> 00:30:19.880
perspective. In fact you've probably heard
a quote from him. He once said to the psychology

00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:26.039
profession in the 1940s, and you've heard
this, "If the only tool you have is a hammer,

00:30:26.039 --> 00:30:27.369
everything starts to look like a --

00:30:27.369 --> 00:30:28.369
&gt;&gt;audience: nail.

00:30:28.369 --> 00:30:33.669
&gt;&gt;Chip Conley: That was Abe Maslow. And he
said it because what he said was that the

00:30:33.669 --> 00:30:38.549
psychology community had gotten so used to
actually studying people in trouble, that

00:30:38.549 --> 00:30:44.379
they just assumed that everybody as humans
had lots of troubles and that their job as

00:30:44.379 --> 00:30:47.749
psychologists was to find the troubles. And
that sort of what consultants do, that's what

00:30:47.749 --> 00:30:51.220
a lot of people do in life. But the reality
is it goes back to where are we paying our

00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:57.019
attention? What Maslow said is, "Let's pay
our attention to people who are fulfilled.

00:30:57.019 --> 00:31:01.809
Let's actually -- what if we studied a thousand
people who are actually in a better place

00:31:01.809 --> 00:31:07.529
in life and we studied their best practices
in the human condition as opposed to the worst

00:31:07.529 --> 00:31:11.259
practices? And what if we could then teach
it to other people?" And that's what he did

00:31:11.259 --> 00:31:14.950
in the 1940s and he created what he's famous
for which is Maslow's hierarchy of needs.

00:31:14.950 --> 00:31:21.009
Now, oops, I'm not gonna tell you whether
this -- there's problems with this model and

00:31:21.009 --> 00:31:25.710
I'm not gonna, and during the Q and A we can
talk about it. It's not perfect, but it's

00:31:25.710 --> 00:31:33.999
pretty famous for actually helping the psychology
industry and profession start rethinking the

00:31:33.999 --> 00:31:37.049
idea of best practices versus worst practices.

00:31:37.049 --> 00:31:43.019
What Maslow was able to show was that people
who are actually fulfilled in life have their

00:31:43.019 --> 00:31:47.580
basic physiological needs met. We have four
basic needs each of us needs no matter where

00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:52.450
we are in the planet, what are they? [laughs]
There's a fifth need that you think everybody

00:31:52.450 --> 00:31:58.029
has to have, that is not absolutely required.
Ask a nun.

00:31:58.029 --> 00:31:59.669
[laughter]

00:31:59.669 --> 00:32:04.529
But it's water, food, air, and sleep. You
have to have it. You cannot actually live

00:32:04.529 --> 00:32:09.529
for very long without those four no matter
who you are and where you live. But that's

00:32:09.529 --> 00:32:14.389
not the purpose of life. And above that becomes
your safety needs. Once those needs are partially

00:32:14.389 --> 00:32:18.299
met, you go to your safety needs, your social
belonging needs, your esteem needs, and at

00:32:18.299 --> 00:32:23.059
the top of the pyramid Abraham Maslow, and
I swear he was not from Mill Valley hanging

00:32:23.059 --> 00:32:26.789
out in a hot tub. He was a guy from Brooklyn.
[laughs] He was not like sort of a like a

00:32:26.789 --> 00:32:32.929
crunchy sort of granola head. He basically
said at the top of the pyramid, people who

00:32:32.929 --> 00:32:35.970
are in the fulfilled state are self actualized.

00:32:35.970 --> 00:32:40.879
And what he meant by that is that they're
being all they can be, to steal a phrase from

00:32:40.879 --> 00:32:47.470
the U.S. Army who actually stole that from
Maslow. Being all you can be. He said, "People

00:32:47.470 --> 00:32:54.080
who are in life in their best place in life
and they feel like 'I'm just being all I can

00:32:54.080 --> 00:33:00.019
be. I feel like I'm in a place in my life
that just feels like this is why I'm here

00:33:00.019 --> 00:33:05.950
on earth.'" When you're in that state, you're
at sort of the peak of the pyramid and you

00:33:05.950 --> 00:33:09.239
would have peak experiences at that time.
And when someone has a peak experience, they

00:33:09.239 --> 00:33:14.190
tend to lose track of time, they basically
sort of become one with the world.

00:33:14.190 --> 00:33:19.169
Now we don't, for most of us, this doesn't
happen for extended periods of time. You have

00:33:19.169 --> 00:33:24.159
these moments of peak experiences, they're
moments and they don't have to happen at work.

00:33:24.159 --> 00:33:29.340
I mean most of them probably don't happen
in work. But I'm reading this book, I actually

00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:32.830
sat for four hours at the bookstore [chuckles].
I finally said, "Okay I can afford the book."

00:33:32.830 --> 00:33:36.769
I didn't take a salary for three and a half
years during this time. I mean I went for

00:33:36.769 --> 00:33:40.399
three and a half years without a salary because
all of our senior executives had to take major,

00:33:40.399 --> 00:33:44.529
major cuts in pay in order for us to get through
the time without doing any layoffs because

00:33:44.529 --> 00:33:46.830
we just didn't wanna do layoffs.

00:33:46.830 --> 00:33:51.909
So I asked myself as I was reading this book
and I took it home and the next couple weeks

00:33:51.909 --> 00:33:58.700
I said, "Well if individuals, if we as humans
can actually be self actualized, why couldn't

00:33:58.700 --> 00:34:03.620
a company be self actualized? Because a company's
just a collection of humans." It's an interesting

00:34:03.620 --> 00:34:05.549
question to ask.

00:34:05.549 --> 00:34:10.139
So I went back to my senior execs and I said,
"Let's look at how we would apply the hierarchy

00:34:10.139 --> 00:34:15.480
of needs to a hotel guest experience. And
we did. And so this is the hotel guest experience.

00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:20.810
And right here on the pyramid, if you're staying
at Motel 6 you sort of, that's all you expect,

00:34:20.810 --> 00:34:25.250
maybe that and the lights being turned on,
because at the bottom of the pyramid when

00:34:25.250 --> 00:34:30.020
you're actually not spending a lot of money,
you do not expect a lot. But if you're staying

00:34:30.020 --> 00:34:33.300
at the Four Seasons, you're expecting a lot
more.

00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:38.470
So what we started to see is that hey Maslow's
hierarchy of needs, there's a hierarchy of

00:34:38.470 --> 00:34:43.390
needs for everybody, we all have hierarchies
of needs. And we started to say, "Well how

00:34:43.390 --> 00:34:47.690
do we apply this to our three most important
stake holders in the company?"

00:34:47.690 --> 00:34:52.090
We took the five level hierarchy of needs
and we turned it into three levels 'cause

00:34:52.090 --> 00:34:57.050
there's really three key themes in life. There
are really three key themes in life. There's

00:34:57.050 --> 00:35:02.670
survival, which is your physiological and
safety needs. There's success or being, there's

00:35:02.670 --> 00:35:08.110
succeeding which is your social belonging
and your esteem needs. And at the top of the

00:35:08.110 --> 00:35:12.351
pyramid, there's this thing called transformation,
when you are feeling self actualized.

00:35:12.351 --> 00:35:19.430
So I'm gonna quickly go through these using
this as the model, our three key constituencies

00:35:19.430 --> 00:35:22.360
and how we apply this to our three key stakeholders
or constituencies.

00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:30.930
This is the employee pyramid. I think that
Google does this very well frankly. In fact,

00:35:30.930 --> 00:35:35.750
in the book I actually talk a little bit about
Google. The base of the pyramid is money.

00:35:35.750 --> 00:35:39.821
Now that doesn't mean that there aren't CEO's
making $50 million a year who are sort of

00:35:39.821 --> 00:35:44.380
feeling like it's a higher need too. But the
baseline is money or our compensation package

00:35:44.380 --> 00:35:51.490
or in Google's case with the full range of
what you have as additional perks, it's all

00:35:51.490 --> 00:35:58.100
of that. It's the package of compensation
that makes you feel like you're either well

00:35:58.100 --> 00:36:03.410
compensated or not. It's not just your salary.
That's where survival comes from, that's where

00:36:03.410 --> 00:36:05.100
you get sort of base motivation.

00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:12.760
But the reality is that most people, most
people do not leave their job because of money

00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:18.910
alone. It's not the number one reason. It's
fourth place. It's the fourth most likely

00:36:18.910 --> 00:36:24.420
reason why a person leaves their job. In the
Valley, it's the fifth. I know you may not

00:36:24.420 --> 00:36:28.510
believe that [laughs] like everybody in the
Valley is just only interested in money. No.

00:36:28.510 --> 00:36:33.290
It's the, in the valley it's the fifth most
likely reason a person leaves their job based

00:36:33.290 --> 00:36:35.660
upon surveys here.

00:36:35.660 --> 00:36:37.931
So what's the number one reason people leave
their job?

00:36:37.931 --> 00:36:38.931
[pause]

00:36:38.931 --> 00:36:40.390
&gt;&gt;female in audience: [unintelligible]

00:36:40.390 --> 00:36:47.040
Their boss. Oh man you're so stupid, you're
so smart. It is. That was good. Exactly.

00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:54.961
So Gallup did a survey and Marcus Buckingham
wrote a book about it -- what was that -- "First,

00:36:54.961 --> 00:36:59.410
Break All the Rules" and he basically showed
that the number one reason people leave their

00:36:59.410 --> 00:37:05.730
work, they join a company but they leave their
boss. So they join a company and leave their

00:37:05.730 --> 00:37:06.730
boss.

00:37:06.730 --> 00:37:11.730
So this part of the pyramid, feeling recognized,
when you actually feel recognized by your

00:37:11.730 --> 00:37:16.970
boss, by your peers, by the organization,
you're seen for who you are, you have a career

00:37:16.970 --> 00:37:22.750
track, you have the sense that you are appreciated
and recognized for what your skill set is.

00:37:22.750 --> 00:37:27.830
When that's happening, you're more likely
to be loyal 'cause you're loyal to other humans.

00:37:27.830 --> 00:37:30.881
You're maybe loyal to the company too, but
generally speaking at the end of the day,

00:37:30.881 --> 00:37:34.570
you're loyal to other people. That's the second
level of the pyramid.

00:37:34.570 --> 00:37:39.130
But at the top of the pyramid is this idea
of meaning and I wanna come back and show

00:37:39.130 --> 00:37:45.530
you something that we talked about earlier.
Take a look right over here on this line here:

00:37:45.530 --> 00:37:51.030
job, career, calling. When you actually are
focused on your money and that's your predominant

00:37:51.030 --> 00:37:56.930
thing you're focusing on, it's a job. When
you're focused on your career, it's typically

00:37:56.930 --> 00:38:03.250
focused on recognition, your career path,
how you're being recognized, how you're feeling

00:38:03.250 --> 00:38:04.250
successful.

00:38:04.250 --> 00:38:08.450
At the top of the pyramid, when you actually
have a sense of meaning in what you're doing

00:38:08.450 --> 00:38:13.430
and what the organization does, you actually
are likely to be living a calling. And the

00:38:13.430 --> 00:38:20.180
big difference between the two lower levels
here and the top level is external motivation;

00:38:20.180 --> 00:38:23.860
it's like a bartering thing. The company gives
you job and recognition and you give something

00:38:23.860 --> 00:38:29.650
in return. But when you get to the top of
the pyramid you're actually tapping into internal

00:38:29.650 --> 00:38:34.400
motivation. And any organization that has
actually tapped into internal motivation as

00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:39.020
opposed to external motivation has created
mojo, has created the kind of magic that can

00:38:39.020 --> 00:38:40.980
last a long time.

00:38:40.980 --> 00:38:45.660
So now some of you may say, "Well that sounds
like a lot of great theory -- but put it into

00:38:45.660 --> 00:38:52.090
practice." Well I have. We have 3500 employees
today, 1300 of our employees clean toilets

00:38:52.090 --> 00:39:00.530
for a living. How do you create an experience
of a calling in cleaning a toilet? You guys

00:39:00.530 --> 00:39:03.780
are smart. That's the kind of question that
Google would ask in an interview, right? [laughs]

00:39:03.780 --> 00:39:07.620
I mean I've heard about the interviews you
do here. They're pretty intense.

00:39:07.620 --> 00:39:09.480
[pause]

00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:18.690
So answer that one for me, how does someone
live a calling cleaning toilets for a living?

00:39:18.690 --> 00:39:19.690
[pause]

00:39:19.690 --> 00:39:25.240
&gt;&gt;female in audience: You tap into their desire
to help [unintelligible]

00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:30.780
&gt;&gt;Chip Conley: What she said was when you
tap into their interest and ability to help

00:39:30.780 --> 00:39:37.860
people to have a great experience in the hotel.
Absolutely. The bottom line is you cannot

00:39:37.860 --> 00:39:46.050
help someone live a calling by focusing on
their task. And this has been proven in hospitals.

00:39:46.050 --> 00:39:51.900
Fascinating survey five years ago: American
hospitals, they looked at hospitals across

00:39:51.900 --> 00:39:57.340
America and they looked at the variables that
create the most successful hospitals. They

00:39:57.340 --> 00:40:01.580
looked at how smart are the doctors, what
schools did they come from, what's the insurance

00:40:01.580 --> 00:40:06.190
programs they have, where are the hospitals
located, are they in affluent areas, etcetera,

00:40:06.190 --> 00:40:12.730
etcetera, what kind of specialties are there.
The number one indicator and variable for

00:40:12.730 --> 00:40:15.010
successful hospitals in America was –

00:40:15.010 --> 00:40:16.440
[pause]

00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:17.470
how happy are the nurses.

00:40:17.470 --> 00:40:19.480
[pause]

00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:24.050
Number one; off the charts way above number
two.

00:40:24.050 --> 00:40:30.060
So then they said, "Well what is it that makes
happy nurses?" And what they found is that

00:40:30.060 --> 00:40:36.050
nurses who think of their work as a job have
a tendency to think of it as a checklist of

00:40:36.050 --> 00:40:42.370
32 things they have to do. And those nurses
who really love what they're doing and are

00:40:42.370 --> 00:40:47.300
living their calling are focused on the purpose
of what they're doing and the impact it has

00:40:47.300 --> 00:40:54.020
on, in this case, patients. For our housekeeping
staff, it's our customers.

00:40:54.020 --> 00:40:59.460
So if you wanna help people move up the pyramid,
you have to figure out how to link the impact

00:40:59.460 --> 00:41:05.930
on customer with the employee. So we do a
variety of things, Chapter 6 in the book is

00:41:05.930 --> 00:41:07.881
all about meaning, talked about some of them.

00:41:07.881 --> 00:41:12.620
But we come up with all of these ways for
our housekeeping staff to get connected face

00:41:12.620 --> 00:41:19.760
to face with our guests and to hear stories.
We actually bring guests who are, guests of

00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:24.390
the hotel into a housekeeping summit where
we bring all our housekeepers together and

00:41:24.390 --> 00:41:25.390
we have them tell stories.

00:41:25.390 --> 00:41:29.650
And we had a woman once come in and tell a
story about she's from Denver, she actually

00:41:29.650 --> 00:41:34.510
had come back to San Francisco, she'd come
into San Francisco regularly, she had two

00:41:34.510 --> 00:41:40.970
new twins and she was a single mother, and
long story short is she got fired. And she

00:41:40.970 --> 00:41:48.270
was on her way walking to the roof of the
hotel to jump off when one of the housekeepers

00:41:48.270 --> 00:41:51.650
who had known her for a long time, because
this woman had been staying at our hotel for

00:41:51.650 --> 00:41:57.820
four years, actually could see she was crying
and she was walking up the roof, walking up

00:41:57.820 --> 00:42:03.500
the stairs to the roof. She stopped her, it
was about 11:30 and she said, "Would you like

00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:09.380
to have lunch with me and the rest of the
housekeeping staff?" And in fact the woman

00:42:09.380 --> 00:42:14.050
said, "Okay." And they had lunch in her room,
in her guest room, they brought other lumpia,

00:42:14.050 --> 00:42:18.920
primarily Filipino staff and they brought
lumpia and all their favorite sort of Filipino

00:42:18.920 --> 00:42:25.470
foods, they were having a lunch together anyways.
And this woman didn't jump off the roof and

00:42:25.470 --> 00:42:31.210
this woman actually came back and told that
story to 600 housekeepers on our staff. So

00:42:31.210 --> 00:42:35.830
creating that impact, understanding – helping
our housekeeping staff understand that they're

00:42:35.830 --> 00:42:40.960
not just in the business of cleaning toilets
and that purpose is much bigger than that

00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:41.960
is helpful.

00:42:41.960 --> 00:42:44.941
Let's move on to the customer pyramid. So
I wanna make sure we have some time for Q

00:42:44.941 --> 00:42:46.120
and A.

00:42:46.120 --> 00:42:51.010
Customer pyramid. The baseline for customers,
the survival need for customers is, "Please

00:42:51.010 --> 00:42:56.510
meet my expectations," because we are expectations
machines as humans. We wake up in the morning

00:42:56.510 --> 00:43:01.030
and we already have like 42 expectations in
our head; that's just how it works. So in

00:43:01.030 --> 00:43:05.630
fact that's true, I mean like you've bought
a car before and then you've had buyer's remorse.

00:43:05.630 --> 00:43:13.180
So expectations here, reality here, the difference
is disappointment. You've gone on a honeymoon,

00:43:13.180 --> 00:43:19.950
expectations here, [laughs] reality here,
[laughs] divorce, I don't know. The fact is

00:43:19.950 --> 00:43:25.140
that's how our minds work and that's how customers
are. And the more we're spending as a customer,

00:43:25.140 --> 00:43:30.530
as a Four Seasons customer, our expectations
are higher than as a Motel 6 customer.

00:43:30.530 --> 00:43:35.800
So first of all, we have to meet the expectations
to even get on the pyramid. If you're not

00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:39.300
even meeting the expectations of the customer,
you didn't even make it on the pyramid. But

00:43:39.300 --> 00:43:44.440
the fact is if this is all you're providing
your customers is satisfaction, you're in

00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:49.750
trouble, you are GM, although GM's coming
back finally, or Sears or Montgomery Ward

00:43:49.750 --> 00:43:54.960
or someone from the last century who thought
that what's the most important thing for a

00:43:54.960 --> 00:44:01.670
company to do is to create customer satisfaction.
And yet 80 percent of customers who are satisfied

00:44:01.670 --> 00:44:07.870
defect because of the Internet, because of
the choices. Because in the past, we didn't

00:44:07.870 --> 00:44:09.830
think we had choices, we now do.

00:44:09.830 --> 00:44:15.931
So meeting desires is a step above that. But
the most important thing, one of the questions

00:44:15.931 --> 00:44:19.630
we ask within the company is for each of our
hotels is, "What's the expectations of our

00:44:19.630 --> 00:44:23.320
customers and what's the desires?" There can
be a difference and then figuring out what

00:44:23.320 --> 00:44:25.630
the difference there is an important question.

00:44:25.630 --> 00:44:32.770
Top of the pyramid though is where a customer
says, "Wow! They thought of something I hadn't

00:44:32.770 --> 00:44:38.430
even imagined." It's when a customer says,
"They thought of things for me that I didn't

00:44:38.430 --> 00:44:44.410
have to ask for." And companies that do this
well are companies that actually [laughs]

00:44:44.410 --> 00:44:51.730
have very evangelical customers. Google has
evangelical customers. I see a lot of Apples

00:44:51.730 --> 00:44:59.310
out here in the audience, very evangelical
customers. You wanna ask yourself, "Who are

00:44:59.310 --> 00:45:04.940
the companies out there who have evangelical
customers?" They're companies generally that

00:45:04.940 --> 00:45:10.590
have actually thought about what the customer
needs and have figured out what the customer

00:45:10.590 --> 00:45:14.560
wants and needs before the customer even figured
it out themselves.

00:45:14.560 --> 00:45:17.870
There are four key ways to do this and if
somebody wants to ask a question about it

00:45:17.870 --> 00:45:21.340
I'll tell you what those four ways are during
the Q and A 'cause I wanna keep goin' and

00:45:21.340 --> 00:45:22.340
they're in the book too.

00:45:22.340 --> 00:45:28.920
But there's a way to actually mind read your
customers and to get there before they do.

00:45:28.920 --> 00:45:36.240
So finally, last slide related to the three
stakeholders. This is the investor slide,

00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:42.190
I'll spend very little time on this. But the
survival need for investors is just being

00:45:42.190 --> 00:45:45.920
what I call "transactional alignment" which
means that the entrepreneur or the company

00:45:45.920 --> 00:45:52.160
and their investors are on the same page,
same business plan, and that's the basic.

00:45:52.160 --> 00:45:56.900
That they're just trying to make sure that
they are -- understand how we define success.

00:45:56.900 --> 00:46:00.650
The next level above that is the relationship
alignment. That's what Warren Buffett, Warren

00:46:00.650 --> 00:46:05.630
Buffet once said that "Dumb investors focus
on the glass of milk," this is the glass of

00:46:05.630 --> 00:46:11.840
milk. "Smart investors focus on the cow."
[laughs] The relationship. So the investor

00:46:11.840 --> 00:46:16.590
focuses on the cow, the company or the entrepreneur
is the cow.

00:46:16.590 --> 00:46:22.980
And then investors who are self actualized
and I know that sounds like an oxymoron because

00:46:22.980 --> 00:46:27.210
are investor's human? That's the first question
to ask. This is a human hierarchy of needs

00:46:27.210 --> 00:46:31.530
and we're trying to apply it to investors.
But when you have an investor who actually

00:46:31.530 --> 00:46:35.270
thinks of their investing as a legacy, it's
at the top of the pyramid.

00:46:35.270 --> 00:46:41.780
This is all three pyramids together: the employee
pyramid, customer pyramid, the investor pyramid.

00:46:41.780 --> 00:46:47.570
There's something in between. There's something
that goes in between, you saw it earlier.

00:46:47.570 --> 00:46:48.850
What is it?

00:46:48.850 --> 00:46:49.850
[pause]

00:46:49.850 --> 00:46:52.050
It's in inverted pyramid shape.

00:46:52.050 --> 00:46:53.710
&gt;&gt;voice in audience: [inaudible]

00:46:53.710 --> 00:46:54.710
[pause]

00:46:54.710 --> 00:46:56.480
Yeah, the heart.

00:46:56.480 --> 00:47:04.820
Strangely enough, in 1997 we created the customer
service heart. 2002, 2003 at the depth of

00:47:04.820 --> 00:47:09.760
the downturn, the dot com bust, we created
the peak pyramid. When we first did this,

00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:13.440
I had no clue that the heart went in the middle.
For a year, I didn't even figure it out.

00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:17.470
And then I was giving a talk at one point,
because this, we tripled in size during the

00:47:17.470 --> 00:47:21.630
dot com bust, Joie de Vivre went from $80
million dollar a year company to a $220 million

00:47:21.630 --> 00:47:25.260
dollar a year company during the worst of
times because of this model.

00:47:25.260 --> 00:47:29.440
So I was giving a speech and someone said
to me, a woman in the back of the room kept

00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:33.200
raising her hands, because the middle of the
pyramid had nothing in it. And she kept saying,

00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:36.760
"The heart, the heart, the heart." I had no
idea what she was talking about. And she said,

00:47:36.760 --> 00:47:41.420
"Idiot! [laughs] Chip, you're an idiot!! [laughs]
Put the heart in the middle." And she was

00:47:41.420 --> 00:47:42.930
right. And here's the part that's interesting
–

00:47:42.930 --> 00:47:44.050
[laughter]

00:47:44.050 --> 00:47:46.780
point number one on the heart is about culture,
but remember point number two on the heart

00:47:46.780 --> 00:47:52.260
is enthusiastic staff, it's right next to
the employee pyramid. Point number three on

00:47:52.260 --> 00:47:57.350
the heart strong customer loyalty is right
next to the customer pyramid. And point number

00:47:57.350 --> 00:48:01.620
four on the heart, maintaining a profitable
and sustainable business, right next to the

00:48:01.620 --> 00:48:02.620
investor pyramid.

00:48:02.620 --> 00:48:07.060
So here's the cheesy part of my presentation
or maybe my whole presentation's cheesy, the

00:48:07.060 --> 00:48:08.060
heart beats.

00:48:08.060 --> 00:48:09.100
&gt;&gt;audience: Ahhh.

00:48:09.100 --> 00:48:12.040
&gt;&gt;Chip Conley: Ahh. Yeah.

00:48:12.040 --> 00:48:13.040
[applause]

00:48:13.040 --> 00:48:18.010
So what's the point of the heart beating?
The heart beating actually means this business

00:48:18.010 --> 00:48:24.170
model is what brings these three pyramids
together. If you're on Southwest Airlines,

00:48:24.170 --> 00:48:29.270
I mean they're not perfect but I'm just using
them as an example today, and you actually

00:48:29.270 --> 00:48:33.800
see a flight attendant who is living his or
her calling and making you feel good as a

00:48:33.800 --> 00:48:40.450
customer, the truth is that experience of
having somebody who's enthusiastic helps you

00:48:40.450 --> 00:48:44.090
move up your pyramid as a customer. And if
you've moving up your pyramid as a customer,

00:48:44.090 --> 00:48:47.060
more likely the investors are moving up their
pyramid too.

00:48:47.060 --> 00:48:49.910
[pause]

00:48:49.910 --> 00:48:53.830
Here's a bunch of companies that consciously
use Maslow. I have put Google here because

00:48:53.830 --> 00:48:58.140
I think you do, I don't know that for sure,
but I have had a couple conversations with

00:48:58.140 --> 00:49:03.350
people who work here who've actually told
me that there's a Maslovian element to Google.

00:49:03.350 --> 00:49:08.500
But some of these others companies literally
have used Maslow. Apple used Maslow in creating

00:49:08.500 --> 00:49:12.760
their retail stores. Ron Johnson, head of
retail for Apple worldwide -- I went to college

00:49:12.760 --> 00:49:18.070
with him. He told me about this. Harley Davidson,
the guy who actually helped remake Harley

00:49:18.070 --> 00:49:23.260
Davidson in the 1980s was someone who studied
with Abe Maslow. Tony Hsieh at Zappos. Tony

00:49:23.260 --> 00:49:31.000
wrote the forward for my book, complete Maslowmania
at Zappos. [laughs] So there's a lotta companies

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:32.540
that use it.

00:49:32.540 --> 00:49:37.690
This is the book and the basic premise is
that if you create peak experiences for your

00:49:37.690 --> 00:49:42.970
key stakeholders, you'll be able to create
peak performance for your organization. And

00:49:42.970 --> 00:49:47.520
it's really simple. It just comes back to
the idea that at the base of the pyramid,

00:49:47.520 --> 00:49:53.750
it's all about survival. And especially in
a recession the tendency is for us all, whether

00:49:53.750 --> 00:49:58.080
we're an employee, whether we're a customer,
whether we're an investor, we all sort of

00:49:58.080 --> 00:50:00.220
go back to survival mode.

00:50:00.220 --> 00:50:05.990
But survival mode is a commodity and when
you move up the pyramid, you're moving from

00:50:05.990 --> 00:50:13.650
commodity to differentiation, to deep loyalty.
And at the end of the day in business, it

00:50:13.650 --> 00:50:18.170
really is all about deep loyalty, whether
it's deep loyalty of an employee through living

00:50:18.170 --> 00:50:23.060
a calling with the company, whether it's the
deep loyalty of a customer being an evangelist,

00:50:23.060 --> 00:50:27.640
or whether it's the deep loyalty of an investor
who's looking at the investment as a legacy

00:50:27.640 --> 00:50:33.890
and a long term investment as opposed to just
a wham bam thank you m'am kind of investor.

00:50:33.890 --> 00:50:38.410
Which excuse the expression, but that's how
most investors on Wall Street are.

00:50:38.410 --> 00:50:42.580
So I hope you'll all seek the peak. This is
a little bit more information on Joie de Vivre,

00:50:42.580 --> 00:50:47.640
a little bit more information on me that my
publisher required me to come up with. [chuckles]

00:50:47.640 --> 00:50:50.770
And then for those of you who really wanna
understand a little bit more about peak and

00:50:50.770 --> 00:50:56.881
some of the peak organization opportunities
of what we do, this is the Website for a lot

00:50:56.881 --> 00:51:01.740
of companies now that are actually using peak
as a model for their company.

00:51:01.740 --> 00:51:07.990
So thank you. I'm gonna open up for questions
and answers now. So thank you very much.

00:51:07.990 --> 00:51:09.670
[applause]

00:51:09.670 --> 00:51:13.860
So questions, anybody. Go for it. Yes.

00:51:13.860 --> 00:51:19.190
&gt;&gt;female #1: So I used to teach high school
students and I used to be able to say very

00:51:19.190 --> 00:51:24.520
freely I love my school and kids 'cause I
love them and now I'm here at Google and I

00:51:24.520 --> 00:51:25.520
teach engineers leadership –

00:51:25.520 --> 00:51:26.520
&gt;&gt;Chip Conley: Um-hum.

00:51:26.520 --> 00:51:31.250
&gt;&gt;female #1: so how do I talk about this idea
of like love of customer, of employee, of

00:51:31.250 --> 00:51:32.930
investor of stakeholders without sounding
like --

00:51:32.930 --> 00:51:33.930
&gt;&gt;Chip Conley: Yeah.

00:51:33.930 --> 00:51:36.230
&gt;&gt;female #1: I don't know what the right word
is but --

00:51:36.230 --> 00:51:38.200
&gt;&gt;Chip Conley: Like a granola head.

00:51:38.200 --> 00:51:43.190
&gt;&gt;female #1: Yeah, or like you're doing this
[ ] or like there's babies or you know --

00:51:43.190 --> 00:51:48.730
&gt;&gt;Chip Conley: Well, so what I've done, so
let me tell ya, Meng and I are gonna be next

00:51:48.730 --> 00:51:54.870
week with a bunch of, a lot of CEO's of companies,
a lot of senior executives in companies and

00:51:54.870 --> 00:52:02.190
some academics. What's great about today versus
say 10 or 15 years ago is there is an awful

00:52:02.190 --> 00:52:10.060
lot of empirical evidence today that a love
based culture, that's going too strong, I

00:52:10.060 --> 00:52:16.200
would rarely use that phrase, I would use
a stakeholder driven model to make it sound

00:52:16.200 --> 00:52:18.430
a little bit more empirical.

00:52:18.430 --> 00:52:25.500
That model has been proven to actually be
very effective for both driving shareholder

00:52:25.500 --> 00:52:33.450
returns but also creating a legacy in an organization
such that it has long term viability.

00:52:33.450 --> 00:52:37.950
So there's a book called "Firms of Endearment"
which is a terrible name for a book [laughs]

00:52:37.950 --> 00:52:42.500
but "Firms of Endearment" actually sort of
went toe to toe with "Good to Great", Jim

00:52:42.500 --> 00:52:46.810
Collins' book and actually studied a bunch
of companies comparing them with the Good

00:52:46.810 --> 00:52:51.340
to Great companies. And these Firms of Endearment
companies were companies that actually took

00:52:51.340 --> 00:52:57.771
a stakeholder love approach to their key constituencies
and stakeholders and they were able to show

00:52:57.771 --> 00:53:05.000
over a 10 year period that the actual returns
on the stock market were much better.

00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:12.830
So I would say language is important, I would
say love based, using the word "love" is a

00:53:12.830 --> 00:53:16.650
cautionary word I would use. I would say there's
other ways you can present it. But in terms

00:53:16.650 --> 00:53:21.000
of those who actually wanna say, "Well I don't
believe in that, I believe that business is

00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:22.181
all about transactions."

00:53:22.181 --> 00:53:28.700
So this is really the difference between at
the base of the pyramid, it's all about transactions

00:53:28.700 --> 00:53:32.920
and at the top of the pyramid, it's about
transformation. And there are times in business

00:53:32.920 --> 00:53:37.750
when it is all about transactions. I'm not
saying that that's not true -- it is. There

00:53:37.750 --> 00:53:42.680
are times when the transactions are what define
the business. And yet over the course of the

00:53:42.680 --> 00:53:47.840
long run, transactions are a commodity, but
transformation is actually something that

00:53:47.840 --> 00:53:53.260
actually shifts something in a fundamental
way. And that's ultimately what Google is

00:53:53.260 --> 00:53:59.670
about. I mean so for you, you have a mission
statement and a culture that's sort of built

00:53:59.670 --> 00:54:06.540
on that so it's easier for you to maybe get
your fellow employees to sort of see the importance

00:54:06.540 --> 00:54:07.540
of that.

00:54:07.540 --> 00:54:12.560
One thing that's been very gratifying for
me is the two industries -- so I was saying

00:54:12.560 --> 00:54:19.530
this to my friend Dan who's one of your smart
guys here and I've known a long time, that

00:54:19.530 --> 00:54:24.030
the two industries that have shown the most
interest in peaks since they came out are

00:54:24.030 --> 00:54:29.610
the health care industry and financial services.
Health care because many people got into health

00:54:29.610 --> 00:54:34.370
care for the top of the pyramid, for the meaning
and the calling, and they don't feel it anymore.

00:54:34.370 --> 00:54:38.140
And health care's going through a major transformation
and it needs to rethink how they actually

00:54:38.140 --> 00:54:43.960
operate. And the other is financial service.
And financial services, as an industry, is

00:54:43.960 --> 00:54:49.630
a transactional industry. And yet there are
huge, huge companies out there who are now

00:54:49.630 --> 00:54:56.320
hiring us to go out and remake their whole
program on retirement and their program on

00:54:56.320 --> 00:55:02.490
how they help their employees move from living
a transactional culture to more of a long

00:55:02.490 --> 00:55:03.970
term transformational culture.

00:55:03.970 --> 00:55:08.560
So I do think there's enough shifts out there
in the business world and in the academic

00:55:08.560 --> 00:55:14.210
business world where professors -- when I
was in Stanford Business School they had couple

00:55:14.210 --> 00:55:18.890
classes on relationships; today they have
lots and they have a class on happiness at

00:55:18.890 --> 00:55:22.940
Stanford Business School now. I mean it's
a class all about happiness, believing that

00:55:22.940 --> 00:55:26.610
happiness is the number one thing that actually
creates success in business. Well okay, we

00:55:26.610 --> 00:55:27.610
didn't have that in 1984. So -- what else?

00:55:27.610 --> 00:55:28.610
Yes.

00:55:28.610 --> 00:55:29.610
&gt;&gt;female #2: So when you were going through
your slides, the slide that has [unintelligible]

00:55:29.610 --> 00:55:30.610
slide --

00:55:30.610 --> 00:55:31.610
&gt;&gt;Chip Conley: Um-hum.

00:55:31.610 --> 00:55:32.610
&gt;&gt;female #2: where you had the expectations
--

00:55:32.610 --> 00:55:33.610
&gt;&gt;Chip Conley: That's [unintelligible]

00:55:33.610 --> 00:55:34.610
&gt;&gt;female #2: [unintelligible] and then the.
So this kind of looks a bit to me like how

00:55:34.610 --> 00:55:35.610
our employees kind of see our company.

00:55:35.610 --> 00:55:36.610
&gt;&gt;Chip Conley: This is -- okay.

00:55:36.610 --> 00:55:37.610
&gt;&gt;female #2: So this resonated, when I saw
this I was like oh this is kind of like how

00:55:37.610 --> 00:55:38.610
I think in a lot of ways especially since
we've become a branded kind of company -- people

00:55:38.610 --> 00:55:59.220
come into the culture with certain expectations,
it's less of a how and I don't wanna paint

00:55:59.220 --> 00:56:14.870
like a dark picture because this place is
amazing, I love this place.

00:56:14.870 --> 00:56:18.010
&gt;&gt;Chip Conley: And you've been here for a
while?

00:56:18.010 --> 00:56:19.010
&gt;&gt;female #2: Yes.

00:56:19.010 --> 00:56:20.010
&gt;&gt;Chip Conley: [laughs] Okay.

00:56:20.010 --> 00:56:21.010
&gt;&gt;female #2: But at the same time I do think
that people come in sometimes with less of

00:56:21.010 --> 00:56:23.240
an attitude of not so much what can I do for
my country, but what can my country do for

00:56:23.240 --> 00:56:24.240
me?

00:56:24.240 --> 00:56:25.240
&gt;&gt;Chip Conley: Right.

00:56:25.240 --> 00:56:26.240
&gt;&gt;female #2: So I'm just wondering how does
this actually work when your employees are

00:56:26.240 --> 00:56:37.080
more like customers I think in a lot of ways?

00:56:37.080 --> 00:56:50.070
&gt;&gt;Chip Conley: Well, I mean so the employee
-- there's a bit of a connection here. When

00:56:50.070 --> 00:56:53.570
employees sort of think of their work as a
job and they're just punching in and punching

00:56:53.570 --> 00:57:03.640
out and the question is, "What am I getting
from my job" as opposed to "What am I becoming

00:57:03.640 --> 00:57:08.480
as a result of my work?" Let me say that again.
It's a very important thing to consider when

00:57:08.480 --> 00:57:13.010
you're doing your work. Most of us in our
work have a tendency to think of "what are

00:57:13.010 --> 00:57:23.920
we getting from our job?" as opposed to "What
am I becoming as a result of my work?"

00:57:23.920 --> 00:57:28.800
Now when people think that way, if you think
that way, you're probably gonna be, "What

00:57:28.800 --> 00:57:33.320
am I getting from my job?" It's very expedient.
It's like okay, "I wanna make money, I wanna

00:57:33.320 --> 00:57:38.760
do well, what can we do" potentially they
may also think sort of bottom of the pyramid

00:57:38.760 --> 00:57:40.960
with respect to the customer experience.

00:57:40.960 --> 00:57:48.401
I think one of the things that I would just
offer here is -- the company's 13 years old

00:57:48.401 --> 00:57:54.460
now, 12 or 13 years old. So the question is
how does Google on a regular basis renew its

00:57:54.460 --> 00:58:01.090
relationship with revolution? [laughs] How
does the organization as it gets larger renew

00:58:01.090 --> 00:58:07.290
its ability to just feel like it is meant
to be a revolutionary, it's meant to actually

00:58:07.290 --> 00:58:11.070
constantly be striving for this at the top
of the pyramid?

00:58:11.070 --> 00:58:15.580
I don't work here so I can't tell you. From
the outside it feels like you do. It feels

00:58:15.580 --> 00:58:22.920
like there's an awful lot of time, energy,
and money being poured into ventures that

00:58:22.920 --> 00:58:27.630
don't necessarily have an ROI attached to
them, but are really purposed for the sake

00:58:27.630 --> 00:58:33.170
of actually trying to create something new
and innovative that's gonna actually build

00:58:33.170 --> 00:58:36.780
a better relationship with the customer and
can potentially be monetized into something

00:58:36.780 --> 00:58:43.070
else in the future. But maybe not. If I'm
wrong, if I'm wrong on that, then that's where

00:58:43.070 --> 00:58:49.820
you need to get back to. But I guess your
point is almost a little bit of the hiring

00:58:49.820 --> 00:58:54.870
component. How do you actually make sure that
the people coming in are acquainted with that

00:58:54.870 --> 00:58:57.970
and then believe that that's part of what
they're here for? Is that right?

00:58:57.970 --> 00:58:58.970
[pause]

00:58:58.970 --> 00:59:00.440
&gt;&gt;male voice: [unintelligible]

00:59:00.440 --> 00:59:01.440
Yeah, okay.

00:59:01.440 --> 00:59:02.440
&gt;&gt;female #2: Thanks.

00:59:02.440 --> 00:59:06.120
&gt;&gt;Chip Conley: Okay. Yes. We're out of time,
we're out of time, we're out of time. If anybody

00:59:06.120 --> 00:59:10.310
has a question feel free to come up and ask
me, please feel free to. And there's I guess

00:59:10.310 --> 00:59:14.630
books in the back and sorry to the team who's
coming in now and thanks for having me here.

00:59:14.630 --> 00:59:15.630
Bye.

00:59:15.630 --> 00:59:15.631
[applause]
