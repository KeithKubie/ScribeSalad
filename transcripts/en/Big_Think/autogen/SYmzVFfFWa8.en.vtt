so basically for most of psychology's

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:07.810
so basically for most of psychology's
 

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:10.079
so basically for most of psychology's
history the focuses i has been on on

00:00:10.079 --> 00:00:10.089
history the focuses i has been on on
 

00:00:10.089 --> 00:00:11.900
history the focuses i has been on on
what's negative about people on

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910
what's negative about people on
 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.159
what's negative about people on
diagnosing illnesses on depression on

00:00:14.159 --> 00:00:14.169
diagnosing illnesses on depression on
 

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:16.950
diagnosing illnesses on depression on
problems and in a lab since like the

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:16.960
problems and in a lab since like the
 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.839
problems and in a lab since like the
late 90s there's been a huge emphasis on

00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:18.849
late 90s there's been a huge emphasis on
 

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:20.580
late 90s there's been a huge emphasis on
positive psychology on studying what's

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:20.590
positive psychology on studying what's
 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:21.900
positive psychology on studying what's
right about people on studying human

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:21.910
right about people on studying human
 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:24.929
right about people on studying human
flourishing and kind of the fundamental

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:24.939
flourishing and kind of the fundamental
 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:27.480
flourishing and kind of the fundamental
root of most of positive psychology

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:27.490
root of most of positive psychology
 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:29.970
root of most of positive psychology
research is the assumption of what's

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:29.980
research is the assumption of what's
 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:31.679
research is the assumption of what's
called hedonism which is basically the

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:31.689
called hedonism which is basically the
 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:33.270
called hedonism which is basically the
pursuit of pleasure the avoidance of

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:33.280
pursuit of pleasure the avoidance of
 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.090
pursuit of pleasure the avoidance of
pain and so there's a lot of researchers

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:36.100
pain and so there's a lot of researchers
 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.190
pain and so there's a lot of researchers
in the positive psychology space or

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:38.200
in the positive psychology space or
 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.010
in the positive psychology space or
there's a few who feel like positive

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:41.020
there's a few who feel like positive
 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:42.540
there's a few who feel like positive
psychology research is very limited

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:42.550
psychology research is very limited
 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:44.130
psychology research is very limited
because basically what one of the core

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:44.140
because basically what one of the core
 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.279
because basically what one of the core
assumptions is is that positive emotions

00:00:47.279 --> 00:00:47.289
assumptions is is that positive emotions
 

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:50.520
assumptions is is that positive emotions
lead to positive outcomes and that kind

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:50.530
lead to positive outcomes and that kind
 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.709
lead to positive outcomes and that kind
of goes against a lot of different types

00:00:52.709 --> 00:00:52.719
of goes against a lot of different types
 

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:54.569
of goes against a lot of different types
of philosophies philosophies like

00:00:54.569 --> 00:00:54.579
of philosophies philosophies like
 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:57.150
of philosophies philosophies like
stoicism or Buddhism or even you know

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:57.160
stoicism or Buddhism or even you know
 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.279
stoicism or Buddhism or even you know
more spiritual practices that talk about

00:00:59.279 --> 00:00:59.289
more spiritual practices that talk about
 

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:01.080
more spiritual practices that talk about
how sometimes actually negative

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:01.090
how sometimes actually negative
 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:02.790
how sometimes actually negative
experiences sometimes negative emotions

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:02.800
experiences sometimes negative emotions
 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.950
experiences sometimes negative emotions
produce some of the best outcomes and so

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960
produce some of the best outcomes and so
 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.649
produce some of the best outcomes and so
avoiding solely avoiding negative

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:07.659
avoiding solely avoiding negative
 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:10.320
avoiding solely avoiding negative
challenging difficult emotions is

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:10.330
challenging difficult emotions is
 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:11.609
challenging difficult emotions is
probably actually one of the worst

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:11.619
probably actually one of the worst
 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:13.080
probably actually one of the worst
things a person can do who's seeking

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090
things a person can do who's seeking
 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:14.640
things a person can do who's seeking
growth you know there's a really good

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:14.650
growth you know there's a really good
 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:16.649
growth you know there's a really good
poem by Douglas Malek and he says he's

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:16.659
poem by Douglas Malek and he says he's
 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:17.999
poem by Douglas Malek and he says he's
talking about trees but he says good

00:01:17.999 --> 00:01:18.009
talking about trees but he says good
 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:20.219
talking about trees but he says good
timber does not grow with ease the

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:20.229
timber does not grow with ease the
 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:21.990
timber does not grow with ease the
stronger the wind the stronger the trees

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000
stronger the wind the stronger the trees
 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.120
stronger the wind the stronger the trees
the further sky the greater length the

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130
the further sky the greater length the
 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:25.950
the further sky the greater length the
more the storm the more the strength and

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960
more the storm the more the strength and
 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.420
more the storm the more the strength and
so essentially strong trees they require

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:30.430
so essentially strong trees they require
 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.450
so essentially strong trees they require
difficult circumstances they require

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460
difficult circumstances they require
 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.590
difficult circumstances they require
strenuous environments that force them

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.600
strenuous environments that force them
 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.100
strenuous environments that force them
to adapt deeper roots and so if you're

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110
to adapt deeper roots and so if you're
 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.499
to adapt deeper roots and so if you're
always avoiding negative or challenging

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:40.509
always avoiding negative or challenging
 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:43.560
always avoiding negative or challenging
emotions there's obviously going to be

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570
emotions there's obviously going to be
 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:45.450
emotions there's obviously going to be
some problems internally you know you're

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460
some problems internally you know you're
 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.469
some problems internally you know you're
not dealing with things and yeah so I

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:49.479
not dealing with things and yeah so I
 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:51.060
not dealing with things and yeah so I
think that there's a lot of problems

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070
think that there's a lot of problems
 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:52.740
think that there's a lot of problems
with positive psychology and kind of the

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750
with positive psychology and kind of the
 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.319
with positive psychology and kind of the
fundamental assumptions anticipation is

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:55.329
fundamental assumptions anticipation is
 

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:58.170
fundamental assumptions anticipation is
a huge component of psychology basically

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:58.180
a huge component of psychology basically
 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.600
a huge component of psychology basically
what most people most people anticipate

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610
what most people most people anticipate
 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.429
what most people most people anticipate
that an event or a thing is going to be

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:02.439
that an event or a thing is going to be
 

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:04.109
that an event or a thing is going to be
more intense than it actually is

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:04.119
more intense than it actually is
 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:06.420
more intense than it actually is
it's why people wait a long time to jump

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430
it's why people wait a long time to jump
 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:07.590
it's why people wait a long time to jump
in a swimming pool is because they think

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600
in a swimming pool is because they think
 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:08.609
in a swimming pool is because they think
that it's going to be an intense

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619
that it's going to be an intense
 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.070
that it's going to be an intense
experience and so if you anticipate that

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080
experience and so if you anticipate that
 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.540
experience and so if you anticipate that
a task is going to be difficult you're

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550
a task is going to be difficult you're
 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.630
a task is going to be difficult you're
probably going to

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640
probably going to
 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.710
probably going to
procrastinate or you're gonna put off or

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720
procrastinate or you're gonna put off or
 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.430
procrastinate or you're gonna put off or
you're going to have emotional

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440
you're going to have emotional
 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.390
you're going to have emotional
challenges going into it but if you just

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400
challenges going into it but if you just
 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.970
challenges going into it but if you just
recognize that you're going to adapt to

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980
recognize that you're going to adapt to
 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.070
recognize that you're going to adapt to
it very quickly once you actually get

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080
it very quickly once you actually get
 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.900
it very quickly once you actually get
into it motivation kicks in so that's

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910
into it motivation kicks in so that's
 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.690
into it motivation kicks in so that's
another one of the things that holds

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700
another one of the things that holds
 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.310
another one of the things that holds
people back is is that they feel like

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:35.320
people back is is that they feel like
 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.440
people back is is that they feel like
they have to be motivated first when

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450
they have to be motivated first when
 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.350
they have to be motivated first when
basically motivation happens once you

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360
basically motivation happens once you
 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.210
basically motivation happens once you
start doing something action precedes

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220
start doing something action precedes
 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.390
start doing something action precedes
motivation so basically a Harvard

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400
motivation so basically a Harvard
 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.070
motivation so basically a Harvard
researcher and I forget his name off the

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080
researcher and I forget his name off the
 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.600
researcher and I forget his name off the
top of my head but he says that it's a

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610
top of my head but he says that it's a
 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.780
top of my head but he says that it's a
lot easier to act your way into feeling

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790
lot easier to act your way into feeling
 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.900
lot easier to act your way into feeling
than to feel your way into acting and so

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910
than to feel your way into acting and so
 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.270
than to feel your way into acting and so
if you spend a lot of time anticipating

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280
if you spend a lot of time anticipating
 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.620
if you spend a lot of time anticipating
an event it's gonna hold you from doing

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630
an event it's gonna hold you from doing
 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.090
an event it's gonna hold you from doing
it but if you just actually start doing

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100
it but if you just actually start doing
 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.940
it but if you just actually start doing
it motivation will kick in you'll start

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950
it motivation will kick in you'll start
 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.170
it motivation will kick in you'll start
to actually get accustomed to it you'll

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180
to actually get accustomed to it you'll
 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.880
to actually get accustomed to it you'll
start to develop capacity will adapt to

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890
start to develop capacity will adapt to
 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:06.210
start to develop capacity will adapt to
it

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220
it
 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:07.980
it
so I think it can hold people back but

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:07.990
so I think it can hold people back but
 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:09.750
so I think it can hold people back but
obviously a positive anticipation can be

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760
obviously a positive anticipation can be
 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.310
obviously a positive anticipation can be
a great thing so like there's this idea

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320
a great thing so like there's this idea
 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.970
a great thing so like there's this idea
that you know you're always changing but

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980
that you know you're always changing but
 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.080
that you know you're always changing but
that doesn't mean you're always growing

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090
that doesn't mean you're always growing
 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.810
that doesn't mean you're always growing
so if you want to grow you must change

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:18.820
so if you want to grow you must change
 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.210
so if you want to grow you must change
but just because you changed doesn't

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220
but just because you changed doesn't
 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.610
but just because you changed doesn't
mean you grew or you became better so

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620
mean you grew or you became better so
 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.260
mean you grew or you became better so
you could you could obviously change

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:25.270
you could you could obviously change
 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:26.580
you could you could obviously change
your habits and I think that as human

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590
your habits and I think that as human
