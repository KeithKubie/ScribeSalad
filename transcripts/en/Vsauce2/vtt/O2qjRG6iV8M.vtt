00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:06.299
Vsauce!

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:07.299
Kevin here.

00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:08.879
Your Vsauce2 friend.

00:00:08.879 --> 00:00:10.200
Your college friend.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.719
The friend of a friend you met at a party,
a family reunion, a concert, an online forum

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.880
dedicated to Japanese role playing games.

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.829
But am I really your…friend?

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:24.919
Probably not.

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:25.919
Why?

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:30.390
Because we don’t like the same music or
movies?

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.710
Because you wouldn’t invite me to your wedding?

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:35.310
No.

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.190
Because your brain is full.

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.329
While studying primate social systems, psychologist
Robin Dunbar found a correlation between the

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:47.210
size of the neocortex and the size of the
average social group.

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.340
The larger the neocortex, the larger the group
size.

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.149
By extrapolating his findings and applying
them to humans, he arrived at a cognitive

00:00:55.149 --> 00:01:00.449
limit for the amount of complex, mutually
affectionate social relationships a person’s

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:01.449
brain can handle.

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:05.750
A research guideline for the number of real
friends you can have.

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.990
A literal “friend zone.”

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:10.690
Of 150.

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:13.660
Dunbar’s Number.

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:20.980
So… who are all these Facebook friends I’m
not actually friends with?

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:27.450
By pooling everyone in your social network
into one tub labeled “friends,” Facebook

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.850
oversimplifies your relationships.

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.630
Your mom, your best friend from high school,
and your brother’s former boss you met once

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:39.740
at a company picnic are all incorrectly assigned
the same level of intimacy.

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:46.910
Your actual social network would look less
like a tub and more like a series of buckets.

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:52.090
High school friends, neighbors, work friends
from various jobs, nuclear family, extended

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.570
family, online friends, family friends, people
you literally don’t know how you became

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.230
Facebook friends with.

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:03.610
You know these are separate hubs because mixing
them gets awkward, it’s why seating charts

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.830
at weddings get complicated.

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.289
Your college buddies and your grandma Tilly
not only have little in common, but they’re

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:14.320
likely friends with a different… you.

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:19.040
And the intimacy of these friendships occur
roughly in concentric circles separated by

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.020
a factor of three.

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.770
You probably have about 5 of your closest
friends formally referred to as your support

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.340
clique, people you speak with every week.

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.600
In fact, 80% of phone calls are made to the
same 4 people.

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:39.360
About 12-15 can make up your sympathy group
-- people who would be devastated if you died.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:45.860
You can probably handle about 50 meaningful
relationships and a maximum of 150 currently

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.950
active friendships.

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.500
Here’s the weird part.

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:56.200
Dunbar calculated this human friendship limit
based on neocortex size in relation to primate

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.319
group size.

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:04.030
It turns out it’s like the shadowy secret
of human cooperation.

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.190
Oooooh!

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.500
No, really.

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.470
A study of the twenty tribal societies with
available census data showed a mean clan group

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.500
size of 153.

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:22.280
Dunbar and fellow evolutionary anthropologist
Russell Hill examined the exchange of Christmas

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.910
cards in the U.K. and found a maximum network
size of 153.5.

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:33.380
A 2008 survey by The Knot Wedding Network
of over 18,000 brides revealed an average

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.180
wedding guest total of 148.

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:41.140
The Roman army during the Republic utilized
a fighting unit called the maniple with 130

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:47.810
to 140 soldiers and officers, while in modern
militaries a company tops out at about 150.

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:53.930
Middle Eastern Neolithic villages dating back
to 6,000 BC usually populated between 120

00:03:53.930 --> 00:04:00.180
to 150, while the Domesday Book of 1086, one
of the oldest population surveys, commissioned

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:05.370
by King William The Conqueror for tax collecting
purposes reveals an estimated English village

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.220
size around 150.

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:13.120
Even into the 18th century the average English
village had about 160 residents.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:18.060
Today, the Hutterite and Amish communities
split if the group exceeds 150.

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:23.550
Bill Gore split his Gore-Tex factories by
150 to keep his employees functioning in personal,

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.389
cooperative relationships.

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:31.259
A 2011 study of 1.7 million Twitter users
found they maintain a stable relationship

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:33.810
with 100-200 individuals.

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:38.169
The average number of Facebook friends is
between 150 and 200.

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:42.819
When an NFL team wins the Super Bowl, guess
how many rings are awarded?

00:04:42.819 --> 00:04:44.120
150.

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:51.979
Wait, so if every person outside my 150 is
just some sort of casual acquaintance, then

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:53.349
what's a friend?

00:04:53.349 --> 00:04:55.949
And why do we have them?

00:04:55.949 --> 00:04:59.710
And do we need them?

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:02.330
And well, that's enough questions for no,
Billy.

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:05.199
Just relax.

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:09.139
Relationship quality and the cognitive complexity
involved in managing friendships means it’s

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:13.539
not just memorizing human trivia like how
one person relates to another and how they

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:19.720
both relate to you, that Judy’s favorite
food is beef stroganoff, or the latest gossip

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:23.860
about Stan dumping Sarah for Sally because
Sarah snuck out with Steve Sassleberry on

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:28.240
Saturday and they smooched!

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:34.740
A friend requires the presence of a social
bond like routinely removing ticks.

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:40.240
The purpose of mutual grooming in primates
is not just about picking parasites, but also

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:44.889
about reducing stress and forming and maintaining
social structure.

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:48.120
Not for fun, for survival.

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:52.900
The social intelligence hypothesis states
that the need for understanding and managing

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:58.370
relationships is the key identifier separating
primates from other animals.

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:02.560
And there’s a correlation between group
size, complex social worlds, and relative

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:08.979
size of the neocortex, the layer of the brain
responsible for cognition and language.

00:06:08.979 --> 00:06:14.339
The need to live in larger groups for the
survival of the species may have driven humans

00:06:14.339 --> 00:06:18.259
to develop the largest relative neocortex
on the planet.

00:06:18.259 --> 00:06:23.270
I’m able to form words and communicate with
you.

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:28.060
You clicked on this video to watch and listen
to me.

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:33.639
Our brains evolved to satisfy our need to
survive, which required forming relationships

00:06:33.639 --> 00:06:34.809
with each other.

00:06:34.809 --> 00:06:39.449
Look, if we’re gonna live on the ground,
in open habitats, and there are snakes, lions

00:06:39.449 --> 00:06:43.119
and dingoes out there, we better have each
other’s backs.

00:06:43.119 --> 00:06:49.779
And probably a pointy stick or something.

00:06:49.779 --> 00:06:54.289
But the internet has made practically the
entire world our social habitat.

00:06:54.289 --> 00:07:00.000
So how do we categorize, sort, build and maintain
relationships with everyone we’ve ever met

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.029
-- and everyone we’re ever going to meet?

00:07:04.029 --> 00:07:08.759
Social media has allowed us to expand our
access to casual relationships and to build

00:07:08.759 --> 00:07:12.020
our network of loosely-known acquaintances.

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:16.780
But analysis of Facebook friend surveys showed
the inner layers of an individual’s online

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:20.550
social network just reflects the size of it
offline.

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:25.360
The internet isn’t allowing us to pass the
limit of Dunbar’s Number.

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:31.439
Friendship requires an ongoing mutual connection
-- it’s not just a voyeuristic one-way relationship

00:07:31.439 --> 00:07:36.009
with your favorite YouTuber even though you
feel like you know everything about them.

00:07:36.009 --> 00:07:40.479
Phil DeFranco isn’t going to pick you up
from the airport at 3 o’clock in the morning.

00:07:40.479 --> 00:07:41.479
What?

00:07:41.479 --> 00:07:43.629
I'd totally pick you up from the airport.

00:07:43.629 --> 00:07:46.189
Wait, really?

00:07:46.189 --> 00:07:47.469
No.

00:07:47.469 --> 00:07:48.749
Oh.

00:07:48.749 --> 00:07:55.360
It’s important to note that the specific
150 number is not a hard and fast cut off,

00:07:55.360 --> 00:08:00.699
but a guideline for the cognitive abilities
required to track individual traits and preferences

00:08:00.699 --> 00:08:03.149
in complex social relationships.

00:08:03.149 --> 00:08:09.300
Some people may have a limit of 100 while
others can maintain up to 250 active friendships.

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:13.839
And Dunbar’s Number is not a suggestion
for how many total friends you should have.

00:08:13.839 --> 00:08:18.969
You could have two and that’s totally fine
- you just can’t have more than your limit.

00:08:18.969 --> 00:08:25.270
It’s not just some memory barrier, a Jeopardy
champion can’t magically juggle 900 affectionate

00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:30.619
relationships, it’s also about the time
required to invest in a friendship to maintain

00:08:30.619 --> 00:08:32.750
an emotional interpersonal link.

00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:37.819
We have a fixed amount of emotional capital
we can spread out among a bunch of people

00:08:37.819 --> 00:08:40.930
or to invest more heavily into a smaller amount.

00:08:40.930 --> 00:08:46.130
And the time needed to keep relationships
going is what can turn an old best friend

00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:49.290
into just somebody that you used to know.

00:08:49.290 --> 00:08:51.329
Like that song.

00:08:51.329 --> 00:08:54.199
Somebody that I used to know.

00:08:54.199 --> 00:09:00.699
What’s changed about living in a time where
you can have 5,000 Facebook friends isn’t

00:09:00.699 --> 00:09:07.920
the number of people you can be friends with,
it’s the number of people who could be your

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:08.920
friend.

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:14.500
By opening up communication to the world,
we put life preservers on real friendships

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:19.470
of the past as we swim deeper into a sea of
people we’d never have been able to meet

00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:20.470
before.

00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:23.520
And it’s changing how we do…

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:25.800
”I do.”

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:30.839
Marriage was typically a social or economic
union arranged or sanctioned by families to

00:09:30.839 --> 00:09:32.779
bolster their survival.

00:09:32.779 --> 00:09:37.520
According to historian Stephanie Coontz, for
thousands of years marriage had very little

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:42.550
to do with the individual relationship between
the bride and groom -- it was really a way

00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:46.019
of turning strangers into relatives.

00:09:46.019 --> 00:09:49.610
A way of sticking new people to your social
web.

00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:53.860
Of integrating new balls into your ballpit.

00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:57.480
Today in the U.S., a third of marriages start
online.

00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:02.930
I’m sure many of you have close friends
you only know from a distance.

00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:10.000
By breaking down barriers of time and space,
we’ve unlocked meaningful connections unparalleled

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.579
in human history.

00:10:11.579 --> 00:10:17.040
For thousands of years we were tethered to
and maybe even evolved to maintain relationships

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:22.899
with the roughly 150 people we happened to
be born around and the families we married

00:10:22.899 --> 00:10:24.050
into.

00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:27.839
You were born in that social ball pit.

00:10:27.839 --> 00:10:34.709
Now there over 3 billion people connected
to the internet ready and waiting for a place

00:10:34.709 --> 00:10:36.379
in your life.

00:10:36.379 --> 00:10:40.779
A spot in your 150.

00:10:40.779 --> 00:10:44.010
Which doesn’t seem like much.

00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:45.550
Does it?

00:10:45.550 --> 00:10:51.850
Until you realize how amazing it is to share
your banana with a stranger.

00:10:51.850 --> 00:10:57.029
While chimpanzees will kill chimps outside
their social groups for resources, a Duke

00:10:57.029 --> 00:11:03.050
University study found that bonobos will share
food with strangers in order to expand their

00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:04.300
social network.

00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:09.741
Bats, dolphins, elephants and many primates
share with members of their own group, but

00:11:09.741 --> 00:11:16.490
the bonobo is offering up banana slices to
total strangers over members of their in-group

00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:20.649
in the hopes of making a friend.

00:11:20.649 --> 00:11:26.600
The human propensity to share has long baffled
us from an evolutionary perspective.

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:29.940
Why give your banana to a stranger?

00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:36.139
But it now seems at least one other species
has seen the survival benefit in finding new

00:11:36.139 --> 00:11:38.709
friends.

00:11:38.709 --> 00:11:45.209
Anyone who’s faced personal hardship knows
how life-saving those friends can be.

00:11:45.209 --> 00:11:50.389
There’s a sentiment regarding friendship
that’s been passed down for millennia, from

00:11:50.389 --> 00:11:56.399
Aristotle’s successor Theophrastus to 19th
century British literary critic John Churton

00:11:56.399 --> 00:12:08.880
Colllins: “In prosperity our friends know
us; in adversity we know our friends.”

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:18.171
And whether you have two, ten or 150, those
friends you know when facing adversity, when

00:12:18.171 --> 00:12:28.019
things aren’t going well, are forged with
a bond so rare, it’s millions of years in

00:12:28.019 --> 00:12:29.880
the making.

00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:32.170
Want a banana?

00:12:32.170 --> 00:12:41.949
And as always - thanks for watching.

00:12:41.949 --> 00:12:46.079
So at the end of my video on the Invention
Of Blue I featured an animated gif from the

00:12:46.079 --> 00:12:48.230
ludicrously talented Kidmograph.

00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:53.910
Well, he has a class on Skillshare that’ll
teach you how to make 80s-inspired animated

00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:54.910
gifs.

00:12:54.910 --> 00:12:59.149
