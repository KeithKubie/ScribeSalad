00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I guess I think it's this one. None of these are exactly true and none of these are exactly false.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.000
This is kind of a fuzzy problem, but there are a lot of cryptographic protocols that are based on,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
on factoring like problems that are in NP.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
NP is a good source of secret keeping algorithm.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
For the same reason that NP problems are good for puzzles--that is to say,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
you might be able to look at an encrypted message and not be able to figure out where it came from,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
but if I gave you the secret information behind the scene, you should be able to read it.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
The people who have the key should be able to decode the message and other people not.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
There are definite cryptographic protocols based on factoring.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
If it shown the peak was NP, we actually have an algorithm that runs very quickly

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
to solve all problems in NP, then this would definitely be true.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
A lot of CS theoreticians will be out of work. They will find something interesting to do.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
I'm not very worried about them. They're very smart people.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
They will presumably not work directly on this problem anymore, but there really only a

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
handful people who spend a lot of their time directly on this.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000
They're usually working on side problems that they hoped would build up to a solution to this problem.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Whether this makes computer smarter than people or not, I really have no idea.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
My own research area is in artificial intelligence and machine learning,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
and there's definitely a lot of problems that we encounter

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
that are NP type problems that we don't have the solutions for.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
If we could solve them quickly, that will be great, but I'll certainly able to believe that

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
if the computers can solve it quickly, the human brain probably can solve it quickly too

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
if we look at it the right way, and for now most of the problems that really seem to stump

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.000
computers, these NP type problems, people seem to be able to do in practice rather well.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
If anything, it might help computers become similarly smart to people.
