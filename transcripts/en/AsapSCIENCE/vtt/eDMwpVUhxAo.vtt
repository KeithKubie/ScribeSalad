00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.540
From philosophers and historians, to poets and
scientists alike, love has captured our

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:09.130
imagination and curiosity for centuries.
Many have experienced the rush of falling in

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:12.049
love for the first time.  Or the deep
feelings of love for your children,

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:16.869
family and friends.  But what is love from
a biological perspective?  No doubt it's

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:20.289
intertwined with the evolutionary
survival of our species.  Afterall you

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:24.080
come from an unbroken line of organisms
reproducing from the very first microbe

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.160
that split in two, to your ancestors who have all
successfully mated since the dawn of

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:29.089
time.

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:32.870
Sadly, if you fail to have children this
perfect streak comes to a halt.

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.080
But while we're driven to reproduce, we're also
driven to make sure our offspring

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.210
survive.

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:40.110
Though we often associate love with the
heart, of the true magic can be seen

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.260
inside the brain.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.430
It may not be entirely surprising to
find out that the brain of somebody in

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.230
love looks awfully similar to one on cocaine.  Cocaine acts on the pleasure

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.730
centers in the brain by lowering the
threshold at which they fire.  This means

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:53.910
that you feel really good alot easier.

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.170
We see the same thing in the brains of
those in love, but it's not just the

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.540
cocaine or the love that makes you feel
good it's the fact that anything you

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:04.730
experience will now more easily set off
pleasure centers and make you feel good.

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:08.260
Because of this you not only fall in
love with the person, but begin to build a

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:12.410
romanticized view of the world around
you.  Interestingly nearby pain and

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:16.350
aversion centers begin to fire less,
so you become less bothered by things.

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.680
Simply put we love being in love.

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.460
So what chemicals are at work to make all of
this happen?  Both during orgasm or by

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.810
simply looking at photos of a loved one,
there is a surge of dopamine and

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.710
norepinephrine from the ventral tegmental area.

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.130
This not only triggers sexual arousal in
your racing heart, but gives you the

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.980
motivation craving and desire to be with
a person more and more.  You see romantic

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:41.330
love is not simply an emotion, it is a drive
from the motor of the mind.  And this

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.400
motor brings about intense energy
focused attention and elation.  The

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.230
pleasure centers are part of the brains
reward system.  The mesolimbic dopamine

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:53.040
system.  If you stimulate this region
while learning, learning becomes much

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.370
easier because it's pleasurable and
perceived as a reward.

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:59.670
We also see a surge in the neuromodulator oxytocin from the

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.080
nucleus accumbens.  Sometimes called the

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.810
"commitment neuromodulator" because in mammals it helps to reinforce bonding or

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.729
attachment.  When prairie voles are
injected with either oxytocin or 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.100
vasopressin they will instantly find a mate to
pair a bond with.  Finally, studies have

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.260
shown that people in love have low
levels of serotonin.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.439
Which is similar to people with
obsessive-compulsive disorder.

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:24.869
This is likely cause of our obsession
and infatuation during early love.

00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:29.039
Amazingly, these areas associated with
intense romantic love can remain active

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:32.209
for decades, and while there are many
other physiological and psychological

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:36.609
components that add to the mix, the truth
is, science still knows very little about

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:41.409
exactly why or how love works.  And yet
somehow, we all seem to know it when we

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:42.469
feel it.
