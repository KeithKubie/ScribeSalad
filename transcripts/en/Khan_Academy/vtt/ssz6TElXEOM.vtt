00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:03.140
We already know that the
derivative with respect

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:09.020
to x of the natural log
of x is equal to 1/x.

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:12.020
But what about the
derivative, not of

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:14.820
the natural log of
x, but some logarithm

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.720
with a different base?

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:22.100
So maybe you could
write log base b

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.470
of x where b is
an arbitrary base.

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.870
How do we evaluate
this right over here?

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:32.240
And the trick is
to write this using

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:33.750
the change of base formula.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.820
So we could write it
in terms of logarithms.

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.230
We know that log--
I'm just going

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.070
to restate the change
of base formula.

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.460
And I'm going to change
from log base b to log base

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.960
e, which is essentially
the natural log.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.370
So the change of
base formula, we

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.040
prove it elsewhere on the site.

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.830
Feel free to search for
it on the Khan Academy.

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:53.400
The change of base
formula tells us

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.680
that log base b of x is
equal to the natural log,

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.740
if we want to go to log base e.

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:02.900
The natural log of
x over the natural--

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.200
actually let me write it
as an explicit logarithm

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.700
so it makes it clear
what I'm doing.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:12.450
Log base e of x over
log base e of b,

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.820
which is the exact same
thing as the natural log of x

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.020
over the natural log of b.

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.180
So all we have to do
is rewrite this thing.

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.290
This is equal to the
derivative with respect

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.770
to x of the natural log of
x over the natural log of b.

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.330
Or we could even write it
as 1 over the natural log

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.655
of b times the natural log of x.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.070
And now this becomes
pretty straightforward.

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:41.680
Because what we
have right here, 1

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.490
over the natural log of
b, this is just a constant

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.470
that's multiplying
the natural log of x.

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.660
So we could take it
out of the derivative.

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:53.890
So this is the same thing
as 1 over the natural log

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:58.420
of b times the
derivative with respect

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:03.200
to x of the natural log of x.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.505
And we know what
to do with this.

00:02:05.505 --> 00:02:09.860
This thing right over here is
just going to be equal to 1/x.

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.470
So we end up with 1 over the
natural log of b times 1/x.

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.670
So we end up with 1
over the natural log

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:22.000
of b times 1/x, or 1
over the natural log

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.640
of b, which is just
a number times x.

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.750
So if someone asks you what
is the derivative with respect

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:38.510
to x of log base 5 of
x, well, now you know.

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:44.540
It's going to be 1 over
the natural log of 5 times

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.200
x, just like that.
