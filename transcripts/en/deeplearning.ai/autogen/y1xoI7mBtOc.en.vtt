when you implement back-propagation you

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:02.639
when you implement back-propagation you
 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:05.030
when you implement back-propagation you
find out that they test called gradient

gradient checking let's first talk about

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600
gradient checking let's first talk about
 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.779
gradient checking let's first talk about
how to numerically approximate

how to numerically approximate
 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.580
how to numerically approximate
computations of gradients and in the

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590
computations of gradients and in the
 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.560

imprint gradient checking to make sure

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460
imprint gradient checking to make sure
 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.609
imprint gradient checking to make sure
the implementation of back prop is

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619
the implementation of back prop is
 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.220
the implementation of back prop is
correct so let's take the function f and

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230
correct so let's take the function f and
 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.049
correct so let's take the function f and
we plot it here remember this is a f of

00:00:38.049 --> 00:00:38.059
we plot it here remember this is a f of
 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:41.270
we plot it here remember this is a f of
theta equals theta two and let's again

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280
theta equals theta two and let's again
 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.250
theta equals theta two and let's again
start off with some value of theta let's

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260
start off with some value of theta let's
 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.889
start off with some value of theta let's
say theta equals one now instead of just

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899
say theta equals one now instead of just
 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.069
say theta equals one now instead of just
nudging theta to the right to get theta

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079
nudging theta to the right to get theta
 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.869
nudging theta to the right to get theta
plus epsilon we're going to nudge it to

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879
plus epsilon we're going to nudge it to
 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.479
plus epsilon we're going to nudge it to
the right and nudge it to the left to

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489
the right and nudge it to the left to
 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.540
the right and nudge it to the left to
get theta minus epsilon as well as theta

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550
get theta minus epsilon as well as theta
 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.299
get theta minus epsilon as well as theta
plus epsilon so this is one this is one

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309
plus epsilon so this is one this is one
 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.020
plus epsilon so this is one this is one
point oh one this is 0.99 where we gain

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030
point oh one this is 0.99 where we gain
 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.500
point oh one this is 0.99 where we gain
epsilon this same as before the 0.01 it

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510
epsilon this same as before the 0.01 it
 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.960
epsilon this same as before the 0.01 it
turns out that rather than taking this

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970
turns out that rather than taking this
 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.510
turns out that rather than taking this
little triangle and computing the height

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520
little triangle and computing the height
 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.700
little triangle and computing the height
over the width you can get a much better

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710
over the width you can get a much better
 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.350
over the width you can get a much better
estimate of the gradient if you take

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360
estimate of the gradient if you take
 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.950
estimate of the gradient if you take
this point FS a the minus F 1 and this

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960
this point FS a the minus F 1 and this
 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.100
this point FS a the minus F 1 and this
point and you instead compute the height

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110
point and you instead compute the height
 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.300
point and you instead compute the height
over width of this bigger triangle so

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310
over width of this bigger triangle so
 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.670
over width of this bigger triangle so
for technical reasons which I won't go

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680
for technical reasons which I won't go
 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.210
for technical reasons which I won't go
into the height over width of this

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220
into the height over width of this
 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.800
into the height over width of this
bigger green triangle gives you much

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810
bigger green triangle gives you much
 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.719
bigger green triangle gives you much
better approximation to the derivative

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729
better approximation to the derivative
 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.020
better approximation to the derivative
at theta everyone you know sort of in

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030
at theta everyone you know sort of in
 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.670
at theta everyone you know sort of in
for taking just this little triangle in

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680
for taking just this little triangle in
 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.649
for taking just this little triangle in
the upper right is as if you have two

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659
the upper right is as if you have two
 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.450
the upper right is as if you have two
triangles right this one on the upper

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460

right and this one on the lower left and
 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.740
right and this one on the lower left and
you're kind of taking both of them into

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750
you're kind of taking both of them into
 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.819
you're kind of taking both of them into
account by using this bigger being

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829
account by using this bigger being
 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.399
account by using this bigger being
triangle so rather than a one-sided

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409
triangle so rather than a one-sided
 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:56.719
triangle so rather than a one-sided
difference it's just a two sided

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729
difference it's just a two sided
 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.330
difference it's just a two sided
difference so let's work on the map this

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340
difference so let's work on the map this
 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.569
difference so let's work on the map this
point here is f of theta plus epsilon

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579
point here is f of theta plus epsilon
 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.170
point here is f of theta plus epsilon
this point here is f of theta minus

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180
this point here is f of theta minus
 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.160
this point here is f of theta minus
epsilon so

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170
epsilon so
 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.559
epsilon so
this big green triangle is f of theta

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569
this big green triangle is f of theta
 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:13.740
this big green triangle is f of theta
plus epsilon minus f of theta minus

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750
plus epsilon minus f of theta minus
 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.589
plus epsilon minus f of theta minus
epsilon and the other width you know

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:16.599
epsilon and the other width you know
 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:20.370
epsilon and the other width you know
this is one epsilon this is two epsilon

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380
this is one epsilon this is two epsilon
 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.400
this is one epsilon this is two epsilon
so the width of this green triangle is 2

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410
so the width of this green triangle is 2
 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:24.089
so the width of this green triangle is 2
Epsilon

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:24.099
Epsilon
 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:25.620
Epsilon
so the height of it was going to be

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630
so the height of it was going to be
 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.280
so the height of it was going to be
first the height so that's F of theta

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290
first the height so that's F of theta
 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.010
first the height so that's F of theta
plus epsilon minus F of theta minus

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020
plus epsilon minus F of theta minus
 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.460
plus epsilon minus F of theta minus
epsilon divided by the width so that was

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470
epsilon divided by the width so that was
 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.940
epsilon divided by the width so that was
2 Epsilon we should work on down here

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950
2 Epsilon we should work on down here
 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.420
2 Epsilon we should work on down here
and this should hopefully be close to G

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430
and this should hopefully be close to G
 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.820
and this should hopefully be close to G
of theta so plugging the values remember

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830
of theta so plugging the values remember
 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.280
of theta so plugging the values remember
f of theta is Theta 2 so this is theta

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290
f of theta is Theta 2 so this is theta
 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.490
f of theta is Theta 2 so this is theta
plus epsilon this 1.01 so take the cube

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500
plus epsilon this 1.01 so take the cube
 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.600
plus epsilon this 1.01 so take the cube
of that minus 0.99 take the tube of that

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610
of that minus 0.99 take the tube of that
 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:59.699
of that minus 0.99 take the tube of that
divide it by 2 times 0.01 seen for you

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709
divide it by 2 times 0.01 seen for you
 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:00.990
divide it by 2 times 0.01 seen for you
to pause the video and solve this in a

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000
to pause the video and solve this in a
 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.360
to pause the video and solve this in a
calculator you should get that this is

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370
calculator you should get that this is
 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.690
calculator you should get that this is
three point zero zero zero one whereas

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700
three point zero zero zero one whereas
 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.960
three point zero zero zero one whereas
from the previous slide we saw that G of

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970
from the previous slide we saw that G of
 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.539
from the previous slide we saw that G of
theta this was V theta squared so when

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:12.549
theta this was V theta squared so when
 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:14.849
theta this was V theta squared so when
theta equals one this is so these two

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:14.859
theta equals one this is so these two
 

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:16.500
theta equals one this is so these two
values are actually very close to each

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510
values are actually very close to each
 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:21.229
values are actually very close to each
other the approximation error is on now

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239
other the approximation error is on now
 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:23.910
other the approximation error is on now
0.0001 whereas on the previous slide

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920
0.0001 whereas on the previous slide
 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.890
0.0001 whereas on the previous slide
we're taking the one side the difference

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900
we're taking the one side the difference
 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.620
we're taking the one side the difference
just beta and theta plus epsilon we had

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630
just beta and theta plus epsilon we had
 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:32.280
just beta and theta plus epsilon we had
gotten three point zero three zero one

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290
gotten three point zero three zero one
 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.699
gotten three point zero three zero one
and so the approximation error when zero

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:35.709
and so the approximation error when zero
 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:40.220
and so the approximation error when zero
point zero three are involved in 0.0001

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230
point zero three are involved in 0.0001
 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.140
point zero three are involved in 0.0001
but so with this two-sided difference

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150
but so with this two-sided difference
 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.720
but so with this two-sided difference
way of approximating the derivative you

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730
way of approximating the derivative you
 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:47.550
way of approximating the derivative you
find that this is extremely close to

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560
find that this is extremely close to
 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.740
find that this is extremely close to
three and so this gives you you know

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750
three and so this gives you you know
 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.720
three and so this gives you you know
much greater confidence that G of theta

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730
much greater confidence that G of theta
 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:54.569
much greater confidence that G of theta
is a probably a correct implementation

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:54.579
is a probably a correct implementation
 

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:58.710
is a probably a correct implementation
of the derivative of F when you use this

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720
of the derivative of F when you use this
 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.660
of the derivative of F when you use this
method for gradient checking and back

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670
method for gradient checking and back
 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:03.090

and remember epsilon is very small

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000
and remember epsilon is very small
 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.680
and remember epsilon is very small
number so the epsilon is you know 0.01

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:03.690
