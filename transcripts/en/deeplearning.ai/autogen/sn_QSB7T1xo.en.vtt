if your training set comes from a
 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:03.500
if your training set comes from a
different distribution than your Devon

test set and if error analysis shows you
 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:07.880
test set and if error analysis shows you
that you have a data mismatch problem

that you have a data mismatch problem
 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.530
that you have a data mismatch problem
what can you do

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540
what can you do
 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.990
what can you do
there aren't completely systematic

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000
there aren't completely systematic
 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.999
there aren't completely systematic
solutions to this but let's look at some

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009
solutions to this but let's look at some
 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.790
solutions to this but let's look at some
things you could try if I find out I

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800
things you could try if I find out I
 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.250
things you could try if I find out I
have a large data mismatch problem what

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260
have a large data mismatch problem what
 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.560
have a large data mismatch problem what
I usually do is carry out manual error

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570
I usually do is carry out manual error
 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:27.800
I usually do is carry out manual error
analysis and try to understand the

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810
analysis and try to understand the
 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.660
analysis and try to understand the
differences between the training set in

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670
differences between the training set in
 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.380
differences between the training set in
the dev test set to avoid overfitting

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390
the dev test set to avoid overfitting
 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.090

the tensor technically for error

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100
the tensor technically for error
 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.340
the tensor technically for error
analysis you should manually only look

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350
analysis you should manually only look
 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.590
analysis you should manually only look
at the depth set and order the test set

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600
at the depth set and order the test set
 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.590
at the depth set and order the test set
but as a concrete example if you're

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600
but as a concrete example if you're
 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.170
but as a concrete example if you're
building the speech activated rearview

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180
building the speech activated rearview
 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.100
building the speech activated rearview
mirror application you might look or I

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110
mirror application you might look or I
 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.619

guess of the speech listen to examples

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629
guess of the speech listen to examples
 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.260
guess of the speech listen to examples
in your jet set to try to figure out how

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270
in your jet set to try to figure out how
 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.910
in your jet set to try to figure out how
your def set is different than your

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920
your def set is different than your
 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.279
your def set is different than your
training set so for example you might

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289
training set so for example you might
 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.470
training set so for example you might
find that a lot of deaths of examples

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480
find that a lot of deaths of examples
 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.990
find that a lot of deaths of examples
are very noisy and there's a lot of car

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000
are very noisy and there's a lot of car
 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.780
are very noisy and there's a lot of car
noise and this is one way that your def

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790
noise and this is one way that your def
 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.270
noise and this is one way that your def
set differs from your training set and

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280
set differs from your training set and
 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.730
set differs from your training set and
maybe you'll find other categories of

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740
maybe you'll find other categories of
 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.780
maybe you'll find other categories of
errors for example in the speech

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790
errors for example in the speech
 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.700
errors for example in the speech
activated rearview mirror in your car

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710
activated rearview mirror in your car
 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.490
activated rearview mirror in your car
you might find that there's often miss

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500
you might find that there's often miss
 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.580
you might find that there's often miss
recognizing street numbers because there

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590
recognizing street numbers because there
 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.109
recognizing street numbers because there
are a lot more navigational queries

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119
are a lot more navigational queries
 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.640
are a lot more navigational queries
which will have street address so

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650
which will have street address so
 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.469
which will have street address so
getting three numbers right is really

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479
getting three numbers right is really
 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.810
getting three numbers right is really
important when you have insight into the

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820
important when you have insight into the
 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.880
important when you have insight into the
nature of the DEF set errors so we have

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890
nature of the DEF set errors so we have
 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.370
nature of the DEF set errors so we have
insight into how the jet set may be

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380
insight into how the jet set may be
 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.350
insight into how the jet set may be
different or harder than your training

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360
different or harder than your training
 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.690
different or harder than your training
set what you can do is then try to find

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700
set what you can do is then try to find
 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.490
set what you can do is then try to find
ways to make the training data more

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500
ways to make the training data more
 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.910
ways to make the training data more
similar or alternatively try to collect

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920
similar or alternatively try to collect
 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.130
similar or alternatively try to collect
more data similar to your dev and test

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140
more data similar to your dev and test
 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.660
more data similar to your dev and test
sense so for example if you find that

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670
sense so for example if you find that
 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.700
sense so for example if you find that
car noise in the background is a major

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710
car noise in the background is a major
 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.800
car noise in the background is a major
source of error one thing you could do

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810
source of error one thing you could do
 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.469
source of error one thing you could do
is simulate noisy in car data say a

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479
is simulate noisy in car data say a
 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.389
is simulate noisy in car data say a
little bit more about how to do this on

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399
little bit more about how to do this on
 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.340
little bit more about how to do this on
the next slide or if you find that

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350
the next slide or if you find that
 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.420
the next slide or if you find that
you're having a hard time recognizing

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430
you're having a hard time recognizing
 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.700
you're having a hard time recognizing
street numbers maybe you can go and

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710
street numbers maybe you can go and
 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.219
street numbers maybe you can go and
deliberately try to get more data of

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229
deliberately try to get more data of
 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.160
deliberately try to get more data of
people speaking out numbers

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170
people speaking out numbers
 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.220
people speaking out numbers
and add that to your training set now I

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230
and add that to your training set now I
 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.160
and add that to your training set now I
realize that this slide is giving a

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170
realize that this slide is giving a
 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:19.990
realize that this slide is giving a
rough guideline for things you could try

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000
rough guideline for things you could try
 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.440
rough guideline for things you could try
this isn't a systematic process and I

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450
this isn't a systematic process and I
 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.420
this isn't a systematic process and I
guess there's no guarantee that you get

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430
guess there's no guarantee that you get
 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:26.970
guess there's no guarantee that you get
the in size you need to make progress

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980
the in size you need to make progress
 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.830
the in size you need to make progress
but I found that this manual insight

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840
but I found that this manual insight
 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.060
but I found that this manual insight
together we're trying to make the data

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070
together we're trying to make the data
 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:35.830
together we're trying to make the data
more similar on the dimensions that

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840
more similar on the dimensions that
 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.080
more similar on the dimensions that
matter the dissolve it helps on a lot of

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090
matter the dissolve it helps on a lot of
 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.220
matter the dissolve it helps on a lot of
problems so if your goal is to make the

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230
problems so if your goal is to make the
 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.949
problems so if your goal is to make the
training data more similar to your def

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959
training data more similar to your def
 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:48.760
training data more similar to your def
set what are some things you can do one

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:48.770
set what are some things you can do one
 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:50.110
set what are some things you can do one
of the techniques you can use is

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120
of the techniques you can use is
 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.540
of the techniques you can use is
artificial data synthesis and let's

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550
artificial data synthesis and let's
 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:53.770
artificial data synthesis and let's
discuss that in the context of

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780
discuss that in the context of
 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.340
discuss that in the context of
addressing the Conway's problem so to

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350
addressing the Conway's problem so to
 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.620
addressing the Conway's problem so to
build a speech recognition system maybe

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630
build a speech recognition system maybe
 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.600
build a speech recognition system maybe
you don't have a lot of audio that was

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610
you don't have a lot of audio that was
 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.790
you don't have a lot of audio that was
actually recorded inside a car with the

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:03.800
actually recorded inside a car with the
 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.530
actually recorded inside a car with the
background noise of a car back on the

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540
background noise of a car back on the
 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.660
background noise of a car back on the
highway and so on but it turns out

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670
highway and so on but it turns out
 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:09.940
highway and so on but it turns out
there's a way to synthesize it so let's

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950
there's a way to synthesize it so let's
 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.400
there's a way to synthesize it so let's
say that you've recorded a large amount

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410
say that you've recorded a large amount
 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:14.740
say that you've recorded a large amount
of clean audio without this car

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750
of clean audio without this car
 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.539
of clean audio without this car
background noise so here's an example of

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:16.549
background noise so here's an example of
 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:17.860
background noise so here's an example of
a clip you might have in your training

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870
a clip you might have in your training
 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:24.820
a clip you might have in your training
set by the way this sentence is use a

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:24.830
set by the way this sentence is use a
 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:27.400
set by the way this sentence is use a
lot in AI for testing because this is a

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410
lot in AI for testing because this is a
 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:29.050
lot in AI for testing because this is a
short sentence that contains every

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060
short sentence that contains every
 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.509
short sentence that contains every
alphabet from A to Z so you see this

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:31.519
alphabet from A to Z so you see this
 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:34.240
alphabet from A to Z so you see this
sentence a lot but given that recording

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250
sentence a lot but given that recording
 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:35.680
sentence a lot but given that recording
of the quick brown fox jumps over the

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690
of the quick brown fox jumps over the
 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:36.280
of the quick brown fox jumps over the
lazy dog

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290
lazy dog
 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.740

you can then also get a recording of car

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750
you can then also get a recording of car
 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:47.350
you can then also get a recording of car
noise like this so that's what the

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.360
noise like this so that's what the
 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.150
noise like this so that's what the
inside of car sounds like I could be

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160
inside of car sounds like I could be
 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.670
inside of car sounds like I could be
driving in silence and if you take these

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680
driving in silence and if you take these
 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.080
driving in silence and if you take these
two audio clips and add them together
