Hey there. I'm Mike Rugnetta,
this is Crash Course Theater,

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.540
and today we're traveling to ancient Greece to uncover the origins of Western drama. Right, Dionysus?

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.060
He's... He's still hung over.
My dude, this is your episode. You gotta get up!

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.320
If we believe the ritualism theory from last episode,

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:34.440
then eons of religious or quasi-religious rituals eventually birthed drama.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.280
But how?

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.720
Well, it has to do a bunch with
our grape-loving friend over here.

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.620
By the 6th century BCE, Dionysus had become
a very popular God in Greece,

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.360
especially among the ladies.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.400
According to some maybe true, maybe not reports, women participated in a ritual

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:57.520
where they'd run through the countryside,
tear apart some animal, and then, come home.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:58.820
It's fun right?

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.100
And if you want to know more about it, you can check out "The Bacchae" by Euripides. It is great.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.520
Whether or not that happened, we do have good evidence that in the 6th century BCE,

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.640
some less wild rituals celebrating Dionysus
spread through Greece.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.140
One of the most popular involved
a procession from Eleuthera to Athens,

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:24.880
where worshipers lofted a giant phallus and sang songs called dithyrambs in praise of... you know who.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:30.740
And one theory about those dithyrambs actually
is that eventually they evolved into theater,

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.180
when singers started acting out the action
instead of just singing it.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.740
Aristotle and his followers think that sooner or later,
a singer stepped out of the dithyramb chorus

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.340
and started acting out individual characters.

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.300
This actor was called Thespis.
Like, actually, that was his name,

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.740
and that's where we get the noun "thespian".

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:50.700
According to stories,

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:57.300
Thespis learned to switch between characters, and to enhance the effect, he got the bright idea to use masks.

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.580
This was Greek tragedy in its earliest form.
One actor paired with a chorus.

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:10.040
It still sounded a lot like a dithyrambs or like a bard reciting a portions of epics as banquet entertainment,

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:15.000
but the direct impersonation of a song's
characters made it different.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.380
And it continued to develop,

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.920
adding actors and architectural elements 
for about 150 years.

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.200
Tragedy, by the way, derives from
the Greek words for goat and song,

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.780
which may have had to do with animal sacrifices
that were made during the festivals.

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.740
Or it may just be another reference to satyr.

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.781
Theater eventually gets institutionalized in Athens.

00:02:35.781 --> 00:02:42.300
Late in the sixth century BCE, pre-democracy Athens was ruled by a tyrant named Peisistratus.

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.540
Peisistratus came to power through violence,

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.680
but once he was in charge, he wanted
to unite and strengthen the city.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:55.400
He decided that festivals, particularly those in praise of Dionysus, would be a good way to get everyone on board

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.400
because wine.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.300
So in the 530s BCE, he expanded
one of the God's pre-existing spring festivals

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:06.780
and turned Athens into city Dionysia
with a theater competition at its center.

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.020
Now, this festival wasn't only about theater,

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:13.700
it was also about reaffirming Athens
as a source of pride and power.

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:20.840
It lasted five or six days and included a lot of events: military and political leaders poured out libations,

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.740
tribute from cities of the Athenian Empire
was displayed on stage.

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.260
Names of men who greatly
benefitted Athens were read out.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:34.520
Children of soldiers who had died in war and had now reached maturity were brought on stage.

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.780
There were also dithyramb contests.

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.840
The theater competition took place
in an outdoor amphitheater

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.480
in front of a crowd of about 14,000 spectators.

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:48.720
That likely included the whole range of Athenian society, even women and slaves,

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:54.280
But of course, only male citizens could perform
in the chorus or vote for Best Play.

00:03:54.280 --> 00:04:00.660
The contest was between three different playwrights each had to submit a tetralogy a four-part work.

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:05.100
The first three parts were linked tragedies 
and the fourth part was a satyr play

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:09.140
which was lewd and usually
involved a lot of prop penises.

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:12.760
In 486 BCE, a comedy competition was added.

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:17.220
Once competing playwrights were chosen ,they were matched with a prominent Athenian citizen,

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:18.840
who would bankroll the production.

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:24.740
Our big spender was called the choregos, and it was his job to assemble the chorus hire the flute player,

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:28.900
and buy the masks or any other set furniture,
like a bed or a throne.

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:34.660
The playwright usually did the jobs that we now associate with director, composer, and set designer.

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.640
Sometimes they even acted in their own work,
alongside other performers.

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:42.440
There may have been up to three actors 
on stage and then the chorus.

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:48.500
Unfortunately, none of the music from these shows remains, but there are some painted vases

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:51.000
that suggests what productions may have looked like.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.520
Fun fact, the chorus would sometimes dance.

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.880
I wonder how hard it is to high kick in a toga.

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.520
For a look at the theater structure itself, 
let's go to the thought bubble.

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:04.580
The theater of dionysus was an outdoor amphitheater built into the Athenian hillside.

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:09.520
You can still visit the ruins today. Its first incarnation might not have had seats.

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:13.680
But eventually, they were added
wood first and then stone.

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.460
The seated section was known
as the Theatron or seeing place.

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:20.840
The chorus performed on a flat part 
called the Orchestra,

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:24.460
and in the center of the Orchestra
was the Thymele or Altar.

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:28.100
At some point, a dressing hut
called a Skene was also built,

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:30.364
so that actors could change masks.

00:05:30.364 --> 00:05:35.420
With only two or three actors playing every role,
you got to change masks pretty often.

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:40.820
There were several ways on and off stage
known as Paradoi, including two side entrances,

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:44.820
so big Choruses could march on and off when needed.

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:51.740
There was also a place on top of the Skene, where an actor playing a God could appear and descend in a cart,

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:57.040
which was called the God in the machine
or The Deus Ex Machina,

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:02.060
Maybe you're wondering why might a playwright
need a god to descend from the heavens.

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:07.420
Well sometimes, you write your way into a situation
and you can't write yourself out.

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:12.680
So it's pretty helpful to have Zeus or Apollo
come on down and make everything right.

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:16.760
All of the actors wore masks made of linen
with hair attached.

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:22.660
So they probably looked pretty frightening, especially,
the one of Oedipus with blood all around the eyes.

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:27.803
Tragic actors also wore robes
and platform shoes called Cothurni.

00:06:27.803 --> 00:06:32.820
So just imagine a lot of big sweeping gestures,
and trying not to trip.

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:34.760
Thanks thought-bubble. Yeah.

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:37.350
Thing is no less terrifying from the inside either.

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:42.080
So during the dithyramb contest,
after each playwright presented his Tetralogy,

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:45.820
a group of 10 randomly chosen citizens 
would select the winner,

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:50.280
who was honored with an ivy wreath, 
sacrificial animals, and a big banquet.

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:56.700
The Athenians took this contest very seriously. And if any funny business was suspected, there were lawsuits.

00:06:56.700 --> 00:07:00.000
Tragedy hits golden age in the 15th century Athens:

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.720
first, with the works of Aeschylus,
then Sophocles and Euripides.

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:09.242
because papyrus disintegrates
and invading hordes kept burning libraries.

00:07:09.242 --> 00:07:11.500
We don't have the plays that they wrote.

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:15.940
Aeschylus wrote as many as 90 plays,
but we have only seven.

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:20.120
Sophocles wrote 120, but we have only seven.

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:24.500
Of the 92, Euripides wrote more than seven,
at least this time, we have 19.

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:30.780
Those thirty odd plays have had a huge impact though, they're still very widely read.

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:35.860
They matter to us now because they provide a template for most contemporary drama.

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:38.860
But let's look for a second at how they mattered then.

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:46.100
It's a huge deal to have 14,000 of your most prominent citizens hang out on a hillside,

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:49.500
watching plays when they could
be doing their civic duty.

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:52.760
But as it turns out they were doing their civic duty.

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:57.640
The leading citizens of Athens decided
that it was important to get together and see plays

00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:01.200
that actively questioned
the values and structures of the state.

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:06.461
These plays are exploring what it means
to be a part of a family and a nation

00:08:06.461 --> 00:08:10.140
and what to do when divided loyalties creates conflict.

00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:13.380
They can teach you to be a better person 
and a better citizen

00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:21.080
by encouraging you to ask through the dramatic action what a good person is and what a good citizen does.

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:24.000
Tragedy does something else too,
at least according to Aristotle?

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.920
He wrote the poetics, one of the world's
first works of literary criticism.

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:35.400
And he had a theory about what made tragedy
so important, and his theory was about Catharsis,

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:37.840
which literally means Purgation.

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:45.260
Aristotle writes that tragedy through pity and fear affects the proper purgation of these emotions.

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:50.400
Now, a lot of scholars have spilled a lot of ink
trying to explain what this means.

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:54.440
So, it's unlikely we are gonna
get to the bottom of it right here and now,

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:58.180
but let me quickly offer one interpretation of catharsis.

00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:04.980
Let's try out the idea that tragedy
by exciting the emotions of pity and fear

00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:08.000
becomes an outlet for those emotions.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:13.840
If we believe that pity and fear,
maybe aren't that helpful in a democracy,

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:19.200
then we can argue that it's better to feel these things
at a play, have an emotional catharsis,

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:24.340
and then just get that stuff out of our systems
and go back to being productive members of society.

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:30.120
Like imagine how productive all those people
who've seen Les Mis hundreds of times must be,

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:34.660
or people who've seen thousands of episodes
of General Hospital for that matter.

00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:40.880
Next time, we're gonna look more closely at Aristotle's theories and use them to discuss Aeschylus's Oresteia,

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:49.060
the only complete tragic trilogy we have,
and then finally on to the Satyrs and their phalluses.

00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:51.140
