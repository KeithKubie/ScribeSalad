00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Now before we jump into this third potential source of error,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
let's talk about a better way to do trigonometry.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
It is nice to put ourselves in Eratosthenes shoes, but computers are nice too

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and can save us quite a bit of time.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
So far, the way we've been doing trigonometry is--let's say

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
we wanted to calculate the cosine of 44 degrees.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:33.000
We find our angle in our trig table and we could read off that the cosine of 44 degrees equals 0.719.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
That works. What if I want to know the cosine of 44.1279 degrees?

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Well, maybe I'd find a really good trig table, but it would be a pain to use

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and we're living in the 21st century--let's get computers to do this work for us.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.000
I want you to go to Google and type in the following: cos (44 degrees).

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Go ahead and do that and then enter in here what Google tells you

00:01:03.000 --> 99:59:59.000
to may be 7 decimal places.
