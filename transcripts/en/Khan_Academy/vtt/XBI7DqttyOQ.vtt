00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.700
Now that we have a general
layout in our minds of how all

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:05.640
of the mechanics are fitting
together, what I want to do in

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.900
this video is discuss a little
bit about why the different

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.560
actors would do what they are.

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:14.010
How they could benefit or get
hurt from this cycle.

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:19.560
And really, why it's so hard to
unwind each of the actors,

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.220
why it's so hard for
them to unwind

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.200
themselves from the scenario.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.840
Where I finished off this last
video, I talked about more

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.720
cash being in American pockets
because of essentially, debt

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.120
being cheaper, government can
spend more money, lower taxes.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.175
And I said that's more money to
buy Chinese products, but

00:00:36.175 --> 00:00:39.560
it's in general more money just
for Americans to spend on

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.980
each other.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.800
They might buy each other's
houses or buy

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:45.790
each other's services.

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:48.610
So in a lot of ways, it does
stimulate the economy.

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.950
For any Keynesians out there,
the more you spend, that will

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:54.150
stimulate the economy,
lower taxes.

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.170
For more conservatives,
that also can

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:57.760
stimulate the economy.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.810
And in general, debt being
cheaper, lowers interest

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.470
rates, all of these things
stimulate the economy.

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:05.760
Now, normally when you're
stimulating the economy like

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.590
this, and you have all of these
factors, you have the

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.150
risk of higher inflation.

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.770
But remember, inflation, or at
least price inflation, is just

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:14.050
the price of all
of your goods.

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.310
But notice, we're buying more
and more cheaper goods, and

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.280
interest rates are low.

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.760
So to some degree this whole
cycle also keeps-- I guess you

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:27.100
could say, the surface growth
that the average American

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.210
consumer experiences looks very
positive and inflation

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:38.050
stays slow, so we can also
say money to buy

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:41.085
each other's services.

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.670
Now with that said, let's think
about why the different

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:47.970
actors want to do this.

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.646
So let's think about it from
the Chinese perspective.

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.820
So if you are China and you're
starting off, you are a real

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.110
Communist country maybe
30 years ago.

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.190
And then you start to have
market-based reforms and you

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.510
really want to enter the
developing world.

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:09.860
But you don't have the
industrial base in the late

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.820
'70s or early '80s to to
really compete with the

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:15.755
Germanys, and the Americas, and
the Japans-- and when I

00:02:15.755 --> 00:02:18.400
say Americas, I mean United
States-- on their terms.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:26.010
So one advantage of export-led
growth is when you're just

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.170
beginning to develop, you have
a less-developed society, you

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.170
have less of an industrial
base.

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.550
So when you have export-led led
growth, you can actually

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.720
build, you actually will
encourage investment in

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.940
factories that can go and
produce things for the

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.190
developed world.

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.360
And by keeping your currency
low-- by artificially keeping

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.870
your currency low-- and
let me be clear.

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.030
With just standard free trade,
labor costs are going to be

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.130
cheaper in a place like China
or India that has a lower

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.950
standard of living.

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.290
So there would be just
straight-up free trade with no

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:07.360
manipulation of currency.

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.200
You would have things that
would move offshore,

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.850
manufacturing and services
that move offshore.

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.840
But if you super charge it, if
you make it even cheaper to

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.550
manufacture, to do business in
China, it'll just accelerate

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:23.090
the investment in production
in China.

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:29.860
So this export-led growth--
let me put it this way.

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:35.280
Artificially suppressed
currency-- and this also

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.680
happened with Japan after World
War II-- artificial

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.640
suppressed currency, and to some
degree we wanted that,

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.966
because we want to Japan to
become intertwined with the

00:03:42.966 --> 00:03:43.160
United States.

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.440
We wanted it to be successful.

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.430
We saw what happened to Germany
after World War I,

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.540
where it was so economically
unsuccessful that it was very

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.840
easy for a character like
Hitler to come to power.

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:54.930
So we learned our lesson.

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.990
We said, you know, it's never
good for another country to

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:59.400
not have an economic recovery.

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.520
So we actually, to some degree,
many people think,

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:02.650
encouraged it in Japan.

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.160
But anyway, you artificially
suppress a currency, it makes

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:13.280
your exports cheaper, and which
then encourages more

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.135
investment in production
at home.

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.540
And in this case, when I'm
talking about home, I'm

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:27.760
talking about China or Japan.

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:31.280
And more production at home
means more investment at home.

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:32.100
More investment.

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:33.820
If you're producing more in
China, you're going to have to

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:35.070
build more factories.

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:46.060
And this means literally more
jobs and, to a large degree,

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:48.600
capital for the Chinese
people.

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:49.850
More jobs and capital.

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:00.220
And as you become more efficient
and as you go down

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:02.150
that development curve, you'll
become more and more

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:05.600
competitive over a whole
series of industries.

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:12.590
And the idea is, once your
people get developed enough,

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:14.820
you will have enough
capital at home.

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:18.700
You will have enough of a
consumer base at home that

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:22.320
some of this extra capacity
can then be turned back to

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:23.050
your own people.

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:26.290
That you can then use these
goods to sell to your own

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:29.340
people to increase their
standard of living.

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:31.860
So at first, you are building
washing machines and

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:35.140
refrigerators for the United
States and Europe.

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:37.450
And because you're building
those washing machines, those

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:41.440
are jobs for Chinese and
eventually, once they have

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:43.800
enough money, once there's
a critical mass of a

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.880
middle-class Chinese, that same
capacity could be used to

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.470
sell washing machines and
refrigerators to the Chinese,

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:52.560
and it would raise their
standard of living.

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:59.780
So it builds a manufacturing
base and a home market.

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:00.600
Let me put it that way.

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:04.330
So from China's point of view,
it looks unambiguously good.

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:18.040
It builds manufacturing base,
and a domestic consumer

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:24.550
market-- which just means people
in China, once they

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:27.690
have jobs and they have capital,
will be able to buy

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:31.320
the goods themselves-- and
domestic consumer market.

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:32.640
Now where is the
negative here?

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:35.170
You could imagine, if you are
the developed country that is

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:38.620
buying these goods, they would
be cheap to begin with, but

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:41.330
now they're even more
artificially cheap.

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:43.760
Well you lose your manufacturing
base.

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:52.000
So if you look at it from the
U.S. point of view, you lose

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.250
the manufacturing base.

00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:59.060
And it's very clear that this
has been happening, whether

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:02.460
you want to point to Japan or in
general, we've been losing

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:04.890
our manufacturing base
to other countries.

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:06.610
And some people view this
as a good thing.

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:08.310
Some people say, hey,
we are further down

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:09.290
the development curve.

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:11.100
We shouldn't focus on
manufacturing, since

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:14.020
manufacturing always tends to
go to whoever can do it for

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:15.130
the cheapest price.

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:17.470
We should focus on knowledge
things, whether it's

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:19.380
pharmaceutical industry
or the IT industry.

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:23.190
So there's maybe an
argument there.

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:26.270
But the other reason why this
is maybe compelling to the

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:29.360
United States is its
lower costs.

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:37.550
So this looks like a negative,
and it is really a negative on

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:40.120
some level, but the one I guess
you could call it a

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:49.700
superficial positive is lower
cost for American consumers.

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:53.000
So if you're not one of the
people who lost their jobs at

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.590
the manufacturing plant, and
your the great majority of the

00:07:56.590 --> 00:07:58.920
rest of Americans, it seems
like a good thing.

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:01.080
Things are cheaper for you, it's
cheaper to buy clothes

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:01.610
for your kids.

00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:02.516
It's cheaper to buy a car.

00:08:02.516 --> 00:08:04.080
It's cheaper to buy
a refrigerator.

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:06.870
It's cheaper to buy an
air conditioner.

00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:11.390
Now the problem is, when
and how does this end?

00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:13.730
Because this whole cycle that
we create, it might

00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:15.730
sound good for China.

00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:17.090
In theory it sounds good.

00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:19.560
You suppress you currency, your
goods are cheap, more

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:21.310
production at home, more
investment at home, more

00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:24.880
capital and jobs eventually,
point that capital, point that

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:27.410
investment back at your own home
market and now you are a

00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:28.210
developed country.

00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:30.310
Seems to make a lot
of sense, but it's

00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:31.890
easier said than done.

00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:34.620
In particular, it's not a
trivial thing to make that

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:39.159
whole market be as consumptive
or as consumer-driven as maybe

00:08:39.159 --> 00:08:41.539
some of these developed
markets abroad.

00:08:41.539 --> 00:08:43.700
The other problem is
this whole time,

00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:45.220
remember what's happening.

00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:48.860
You're just accumulating this
mass of, in this case, U.S.

00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:52.480
dollars and you're using it
to go essentially lend to

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:54.920
Americans, to lend to the
government, and it essentially

00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:57.640
gets lent to the American
people.

00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:00.010
And the minute that
you stop doing it,

00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:01.420
think about what happens.

00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:04.680
The minute that you stop, let's
not even talk about

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:07.670
unwinding this, let's say the
minute that you stop buying

00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:11.430
dollars, your currency will
inflate and the holdings--

00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:22.520
these trillions of dollars of
assets-- will drop in value,

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:25.250
because the minute you stop
buying dollars, the currency

00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:29.350
markets will allow the yuan to
appreciate, the dollar to drop

00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:35.630
and so stopping buying leads
to drop in value.

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:41.310
And that's just if
they stop buying.

00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:46.430
If they actually ever tried to
unwind this situation, as they

00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:48.660
start selling these, that
would drop the value of

00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:50.340
whether you want to call it
the dollar or the U.S.

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:52.980
Treasuries even more, and so
everything else they're

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:55.450
holding would drop in
even more value.

00:09:55.450 --> 00:09:58.400
So the whole time, in order to
keep their currency propped

00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:00.650
up, they've been buying these
assets, they've been buying

00:10:00.650 --> 00:10:01.560
these dollars.

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:05.730
But the very act of unwinding it
will-- I won't say make it

00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:11.020
worthless-- but it will make the
value of their holdings go

00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:12.120
down dramatically.

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:14.160
So you have a very hard
situation for the Chinesese.

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:17.700
It's a hard situation
to even get out of.

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:19.770
And it's just as hard for the
U.S. because if you think

00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:22.160
about it, a lot of people in
the U.S. would look at this

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:23.910
and they'd say, hey,
this is horrible.

00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:26.590
This is why our manufacturing
base has gone away and it is

00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:28.650
partially true.

00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:32.400
And so they'd say hey, let
the currencies just

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:33.690
do what they will.

00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:36.060
No more artificial distortions,
no more

00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:37.480
manipulation by government.

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:40.070
Let the currencies be
freely trading.

00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:43.900
But what would happen then
to the United States?

00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:48.970
The minute that China stops
doing this, stops artificially

00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:51.760
supporting their currency, or
even worse, the minute they

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:55.300
start unwinding all of these
dollars that they've

00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:56.670
accumulated, what's
going to happen?

00:10:56.670 --> 00:10:59.015
They're going to start selling
U.S. Treasuries, there's going

00:10:59.015 --> 00:11:01.640
to be lower demand for U.S.
Treasuries because they're not

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:03.610
even buying it, they might
be selling it.

00:11:03.610 --> 00:11:12.690
Interest rates are going to go
up, long-term interest would

00:11:12.690 --> 00:11:14.390
go up in the United States.

00:11:14.390 --> 00:11:17.190
Now when long-term interest
rates go up, that means that

00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:21.150
borrowing is harder, that people
will want more interest

00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:24.480
to lend you money, that credit
card rates will go up and in

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:27.020
general, the entire United
States economy will go down.

00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:28.400
Why are we in this recession
right now?

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:30.280
Because it is harder
to borrow.

00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:33.420
We were so dependent on cheap
debt, and when that debt got a

00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:36.160
little less cheap, everything
kind of ground to a halt.

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:41.250
That would be even worse if the
Chinese stopped buying our

00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:43.240
debt and allowed interest
rates to go up.

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:47.000
So we are kind of locked in
this very perverse cycle,

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.320
where although it looks like the
Chinese are unambiguously

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:53.730
I guess, benefiting from this,
they are accumulating these

00:11:53.730 --> 00:11:56.480
assets and the minute that they
try to stop accumulating

00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:58.380
those assets, the value
of those assets

00:11:58.380 --> 00:11:59.420
are going to go down.

00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:01.620
And even though the United
States looks like it's getting

00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:03.970
their manufacturing base
depleted-- and that is true,

00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:06.340
it is getting its manufacturing
base depleted

00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:09.230
because of this-- it is keeping
interest rates low.

00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:10.840
And if you're a politician,
you like that.

00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:12.680
It makes the overall
environment look

00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:14.640
superficially positive.

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:16.860
I'll leave you there and let
you think about this whole

00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:17.990
situation for a little bit.

00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:20.700
In the next video, I'll try to
do a little bit of analogy to

00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:23.480
think about where all
of this might go.
