This episode of DNews is brought to you by
Canon PIXMA Pro inkjet printers: Exactly as

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.100
you envisioned.

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:10.560
It’s a debate that’s been raging on since
the dawn of photography: The rule of Thirds,

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.410
vs. the Golden Ratio.

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:17.200
So what are they, and is one REALLY better
than the other?

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:25.099
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews - and those
of you who enjoy photography have probably

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:26.349
heard of the Rule of Thirds.

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:31.119
It’s a general rule of composition for both
photos and film, and it’s the reason almost

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:35.930
all cameras come with those gridlines that
divide the photo into 9 equal sections.

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.550
The basic formula is that the object you’re
trying to highlight or bring attention to

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:44.500
in your photos, should be positioned either
along on a gridline or at an intersection

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:45.650
of two lines.

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:50.180
The idea being that it creates more tension
and interest, than simply centering the object.

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.980
For hundreds of years, the Rule of Thirds
has been one of the most universally accepted

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:55.970
guidelines for composing photographs.

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:00.260
But recently, many have chosen to eschew it
in favor of the Golden Ratio.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.040
So what is the Golden Ratio, and how does
it apply to photography?

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:09.040
Well, much like Pi, the Golden Ratio is an
irrational number, roughly approximated to

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.550
1.618.

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.050
And that number is based on a very specific
formula.

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:18.230
Suppose you have a finite line A, and somewhere
in the middle of that line is a point, separating

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:20.260
it into two segments of different lengths.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.880
We’ll call the longer line B and the shorter
line C.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:28.510
Now, if you were divide the length of B by
C, and it was EQUAL to the length of A over

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.430
B, then those two numbers would be in the
golden ratio.

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.120
And from there, you can create something called
a Golden Spiral.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:38.130
It’s a logarithmic spiral - which are found
all over the place in nature - but with a

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.960
growth factor that’s equal to the golden
ratio.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.820
Meaning that for every quarter-turn the spiral
makes, the line gets 1 Golden Ratio further

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.330
away from its center point.

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.420
Eventually creating something that looks like
this.

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.930
And it’s this spiral, that’s the basis
for the Golden Ratio rule of photography.

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.140
The idea is that by overlaying the Golden
Spiral on top of your photographs, you want

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.900
the focal object to line up at the intersection
of those two red lines.

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.240
So if you were taking a portrait, for example,
you’d want the person’s eyes to be right

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:06.270
around that point.

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.440
You can also expand those red lines along
the length of the image, and mirror them on

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.970
the other side, ultimately creating something
called a Phi grid - Phi being the symbol for

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:15.970
the Golden Ratio.

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.780
So when people talk about using the Golden
Ratio to compose their photos, what they’re

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.390
really talking about, is using a Phi Grid
- instead of the grid used for the Rule of

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:24.390
Thirds.

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.190
As far as grids go, they look relatively similar.

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.490
But a lot of people claim that the Phi grid
is a better choice, because it produces a

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:34.770
more balanced image - especially when it comes
to landscape photography.

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:38.280
The main complaint with the Rule of Thirds
is that it can look too obvious - whereas

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.740
the Phi grid, makes photos appear more natural
and less rigid.

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:45.610
For now, it seems like both options are still
valid rules of photography.

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:50.000
But the Golden Ratio is definitely the better
choice for certain scenarios, like landscapes,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.959
and in general - it’s just a little more
pleasing to the eye.

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:57.069
