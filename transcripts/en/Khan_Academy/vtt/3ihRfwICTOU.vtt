00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.095
- [Instructor] What are the
first three non-zero terms

00:00:02.095 --> 00:00:03.746
of the Maclaurin series for the function

00:00:03.746 --> 00:00:06.993
f of x is equal to x cosine of x?

00:00:06.993 --> 00:00:09.347
So, one thing that you're
immediately gonna find,

00:00:09.347 --> 00:00:10.180
let's just remind ourselves

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:12.210
what a Maclaurin series looks like.

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.872
So, our f of x can be
approximated by the polynomial,

00:00:15.872 --> 00:00:18.218
we're gonna evaluate f at zero, that's why

00:00:18.218 --> 00:00:20.342
it's a Maclaurin series, it's
gonna be centered at zero,

00:00:20.342 --> 00:00:22.342
it's a Taylor series centered at zero.

00:00:22.342 --> 00:00:23.342
Plus f prime

00:00:24.552 --> 00:00:25.802
of zero times x

00:00:27.184 --> 00:00:31.149
plus the second derivative
evaluated at zero

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:33.684
times x squared over two

00:00:33.684 --> 00:00:36.745
plus the third derivative
evaluated at zero

00:00:36.745 --> 00:00:39.470
times x to the third over three factorial,

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:41.527
we could view this as
two factorial as well,

00:00:41.527 --> 00:00:43.729
and we keep going on
and on and on forever.

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:45.139
And, what you're
immediately going to find,

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:47.715
is when you start taking
the derivative of f

00:00:47.715 --> 00:00:48.837
and then the second and the third

00:00:48.837 --> 00:00:50.401
and the fourth and the fifth derivative,

00:00:50.401 --> 00:00:51.708
you're actually gonna have to take

00:00:51.708 --> 00:00:52.837
a bunch of derivatives here.

00:00:52.837 --> 00:00:54.690
Every time you're going to
have to apply the product rule,

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.372
this is going to get very
hairy, very, very fast.

00:00:57.372 --> 00:00:59.938
So, there's actually a
trick to this problem.

00:00:59.938 --> 00:01:02.238
What we wanna do, we
could find the Maclaurin,

00:01:02.238 --> 00:01:04.872
we can find the first three non-zero terms

00:01:04.872 --> 00:01:07.649
of the Maclaurin series for cosine of x,

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:11.661
and then just multiply that by x, because,

00:01:11.661 --> 00:01:12.754
x cosine of x,

00:01:12.754 --> 00:01:15.767
you could view as the same
thing as x times the--

00:01:15.767 --> 00:01:17.547
or another way of saying it is:

00:01:17.547 --> 00:01:21.329
the first three terms of the
Maclaurin expansion for this

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:24.447
is just going to be x
times the first three terms

00:01:24.447 --> 00:01:27.390
of the Maclaurin
expansion for cosine of x.

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.086
So, let's do that.

00:01:29.086 --> 00:01:30.828
So, to do that, let's just
think about the various

00:01:30.828 --> 00:01:33.356
derivatives of cosine of x.

00:01:33.356 --> 00:01:34.848
So, if f of x,

00:01:34.848 --> 00:01:37.112
I'm gonna use a different
letter here for the function.

00:01:37.112 --> 00:01:38.862
If g of x is equal

00:01:39.858 --> 00:01:41.564
to cosine of x,

00:01:41.564 --> 00:01:42.731
then g of zero

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.315
is going to be equal to one.

00:01:47.315 --> 00:01:49.283
And then the first derivative

00:01:49.283 --> 00:01:53.016
would be equal to negative sine of x,

00:01:53.016 --> 00:01:56.529
so the first derivative
evaluated at zero is zero

00:01:56.529 --> 00:01:58.193
sine of anything, or
negative sine of anyth--

00:01:58.193 --> 00:02:00.789
of zero I should say, is gonna be zero.

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:03.338
And the the second derivative,

00:02:03.338 --> 00:02:05.095
well, derivative of sine is cosine

00:02:05.095 --> 00:02:05.948
so it's negative sine,

00:02:05.948 --> 00:02:08.853
so it's negative cosine of x.

00:02:08.853 --> 00:02:12.770
And so, the second
derivative evaluated at zero

00:02:14.141 --> 00:02:16.821
is going to be equal to negative one,

00:02:16.821 --> 00:02:18.749
you might start seeing a pattern here.

00:02:18.749 --> 00:02:20.832
The third derivative of x

00:02:23.265 --> 00:02:25.015
is equal to sine of x

00:02:26.745 --> 00:02:29.926
and so if I evaluate the
third derivative at zero

00:02:29.926 --> 00:02:31.386
I'm gonna get zero again.

00:02:31.386 --> 00:02:32.842
And then, when I take
the derivative of this,

00:02:32.842 --> 00:02:34.563
when I take the fourth derivative,

00:02:34.563 --> 00:02:36.682
I get back to cosine of
x, the fourth derivative

00:02:36.682 --> 00:02:38.430
is the same thing as the function.

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:39.994
So, the fourth derivative
evaluated at zero,

00:02:39.994 --> 00:02:42.077
this is also going to be
the fourth derivative--

00:02:42.077 --> 00:02:44.414
I'll write it like
that--evaluated at zero.

00:02:44.414 --> 00:02:47.490
This is also going to
be the fifth derivative

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:49.607
evaluated at zero, this cycles.

00:02:49.607 --> 00:02:51.931
This is going to be the sixth derivative

00:02:51.931 --> 00:02:53.567
evaluated at zero.

00:02:53.567 --> 00:02:55.960
This is going to be the seventh derivative

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.787
evaluated at zero.

00:02:57.787 --> 00:03:01.551
And so, what are the first
three non-zero terms?

00:03:01.551 --> 00:03:03.882
Well, let's see, it's gonna be this one.

00:03:03.882 --> 00:03:05.828
It's going to be this one.

00:03:05.828 --> 00:03:08.495
And, it is going to be this one.

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:12.267
And so, we're gonna have this term,

00:03:13.975 --> 00:03:15.993
or let me just do it for cosine of x.

00:03:15.993 --> 00:03:18.456
So, let me write this
down, so I'm gonna write--

00:03:18.456 --> 00:03:21.241
and you might already know
the first three non-zero

00:03:21.241 --> 00:03:23.286
terms of the Maclaurin
series for cosine of x,

00:03:23.286 --> 00:03:25.828
but I'm finding it here for us--

00:03:25.828 --> 00:03:28.511
so cosine of x is approximately equal to

00:03:28.511 --> 00:03:32.406
the first term here is
just cosine of zero,

00:03:32.406 --> 00:03:34.060
so that's just one.

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.464
And then, the next one is going to be

00:03:35.464 --> 00:03:37.279
our second derivative,

00:03:37.279 --> 00:03:38.696
so it's minus one

00:03:40.206 --> 00:03:41.706
over two factorial

00:03:43.464 --> 00:03:46.774
times x squared--this
is the one that involves

00:03:46.774 --> 00:03:49.746
the second derivative--x squared.

00:03:49.746 --> 00:03:52.791
And then, we're going to
involve the fourth derivative,

00:03:52.791 --> 00:03:54.431
and the coefficient's one so it's gonna be

00:03:54.431 --> 00:03:55.264
plus one

00:03:56.293 --> 00:03:57.876
over four factorial

00:03:59.138 --> 00:04:00.708
times x to the fourth.

00:04:00.708 --> 00:04:02.764
If it involves the fourth derivative,

00:04:02.764 --> 00:04:04.927
it's gonna be divided by four factorial,

00:04:04.927 --> 00:04:07.048
it's going to be times x to the fourth.

00:04:07.048 --> 00:04:07.881
And there you have it.

00:04:07.881 --> 00:04:10.517
These are the first three non-zero terms

00:04:10.517 --> 00:04:12.092
of the Maclaurin--oh sorry!

00:04:12.092 --> 00:04:15.825
These are the first three
non-zero terms of the Maclaurin

00:04:15.825 --> 00:04:18.215
series for cosine of x,

00:04:18.215 --> 00:04:21.597
and so then we can say x cosine of x.

00:04:21.597 --> 00:04:23.847
So, x times cosine of x.

00:04:25.396 --> 00:04:28.838
I'm just gonna multiple
each of these things by x.

00:04:28.838 --> 00:04:29.671
So, one way to think about it,

00:04:29.671 --> 00:04:31.460
I'm multiplying both
sides of this times x.

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:36.076
So, I'm getting x minus
one over two factorial,

00:04:36.076 --> 00:04:39.220
times x to the third power,

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:42.063
plus one over four factorial,

00:04:42.063 --> 00:04:44.968
times x to the fifth power.

00:04:44.968 --> 00:04:45.801
And we're done.

00:04:45.801 --> 00:04:48.010
And even though this
might have seemed a little

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:50.110
hairy and a bit of a long process,

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:52.546
some people have it somewhat
committed to memory,

00:04:52.546 --> 00:04:55.876
what the Maclaurin series
expansion of cosine of x

00:04:55.876 --> 00:04:58.937
and sine of x are, and
sometimes e to the x, as well.

00:04:58.937 --> 00:05:01.325
And then, this could
be a very fast process

00:05:01.325 --> 00:05:03.139
where you just multiply that by x.

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:05.376
But, as you can see, even
finding that Maclaurin series

00:05:05.376 --> 00:05:08.824
expansion for cosine of x isn't too bad.

00:05:08.824 --> 00:05:10.106
If you'd done it the other
way, if you'd just tried

00:05:10.106 --> 00:05:11.847
to take the first, second,
third, fourth, fifth,

00:05:11.847 --> 00:05:14.827
or all the way to the
fourth derivative of this

00:05:14.827 --> 00:05:16.205
and evaluated zero it would've gotten

00:05:16.205 --> 00:05:18.122
very, very, very hairy.
