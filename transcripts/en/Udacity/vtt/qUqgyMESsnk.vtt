The answer is that they're totally unrelated.

This might not be what you expected.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
If a ball is going faster, maybe you think it'll spend more time in the air or less time in the air.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
But the data says, no, and in physics we have to listen to the data.

00:00:12.000 --> 99:59:59.000
This is hinting at a deep and beautiful fundamental truth of 2-dimensional motion.
