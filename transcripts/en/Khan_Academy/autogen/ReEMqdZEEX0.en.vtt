00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.150
 Let's solve some more sample tasks 

00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:04.310
 with graphics of rational functions. 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:11.530
 Let's say I have y = 2x / (x + 1). 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:14.600
 First, let's find the horizontal ones 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.020
 asymptotes, if any. 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:20.630
 As I said before, we only need to see which one 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.510
 is the highest degree in numerator and denominator. 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:28.260
 Well, we have only 2x here 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.630
 and x here - 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.780
 both are of first grade. 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:39.300
 So when x goes to infinity, 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.410
 or when taking extremely high values, 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.300
 these two members will dominate. 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.280
 It will not matter much. 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.800
 Then y will be approximately equal 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:57.270
 at 2x / x or just at 2. 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.890
 In fact, the same is true if x 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:01.990
 Tend to minus infinity. 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:05.470
 That is, when x becomes extremely large or small, 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:07.340
 this will turn to 2. 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.210
 This article will not matter much. 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.330
 Let's draw this horizontal asymptote. 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.700
 So this is y = 2. 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.080
 Let's make the chart. 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:23.900
 Here's her horizontal asymptote. 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:30.340
 y = 2, let me write this. 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.210
 Horizontal asymptote. 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.260
 Here's what's approaching our chart, but never reaching, 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.530
 when we get more and more positive 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.890
 or increasingly negative values ​​of x. 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.270
 Now, do we have vertical asymptotes? 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:50.850
 Yes of course. 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.260
 When x = -1, the function 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.630
 is undefined. 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:06.550
 That is, we say y is undetermined when x = -1. 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:09.510
 This is certainly true, because when x = -1, 

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:11.130
 the denominator becomes 0. 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:12.990
 We do not know what is 1, divided by 0. 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.040
 This is an undefined value. 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.950
 And this is a vertical asymptote, 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.190
 because (x + 1) is not abbreviated 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.540
 with nothing else. 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.840
 Let me give you a quick example. 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.350
 Let's say I have the equation y is equal 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:30.950
 of (x + 1) on (x + 1). 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.430
 Here you might say that when 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.730
 x = -1, my chart is undefined. 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.280
 And it will be true because if we put -1 here, 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.770
 below we will have 0. 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.630
 In fact, we will get 0 above. 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.170
 We will have 0 on 0. 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.110
 This is indefinite. 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.850
 But as we can see, if we assume that x is not 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:56.480
 equal to -1 or that these members are not 0, 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.820
 we can divide the numerator and the denominator into (x + 1). 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.770
 Or we can say that 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:04.250
 this on it (that is, on itself) 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:05.950
 will be equal to 1. 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.220
 You can say that this will be equal to 1 when 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:17.950
 x is not equal to -1 or when these members are not 0. 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.940
 When x = -1, we will have 0 on 0, 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.090
 which we do not know what it is. 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.570
 So in this situation we would not 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:28.140
 had a vertical asymptote. 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:36.000
 Here, this graph has no vertical asymptotis. 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.070
 Actually, maybe you're wondering 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:40.000
 how would the chart look like? 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.470
 I will draw it. 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:46.940
 If I had to draw the chart here, 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:50.620
 y would be equal to 1 for all values, 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.250
 except for x = -1. 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:04:00.530
 Here is the graph in this situation - y = 1 anywhere, 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:03.950
 except for x = -1. 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:06.355
 It is then indefinite. 

00:04:06.355 --> 00:04:08.710
 So here we have to have a hole. 

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:11.850
 Here we draw a small concave circle, 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.390
 because we do not know what y will be, 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:16.990
 when x = -1. 

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:19.360
 It would look like something like that. 

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.660
 As horizontal rights. 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.580
 We have no vertical asymptote. 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:27.420
 This is because this and this member are being cut short, 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:29.910
 when they are not equal to 0 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:32.030
 or when x is not -1. 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:39.040
 Let me make it clear that when looking for vertical asymptotes, 

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.720
 we need to make sure this expression here 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.800
 is not abridged by anything from the numerator. 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.410
 And in this case it is not abridged. 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:46.910
 And in this case it is shortened, so 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:48.400
 we have no vertical asymptote. 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.570
 In this case, because it is not abridged, 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:52.820
 we have a vertical asymptote. 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:55.770
 x = -1 is a vertical asymptote 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:57.690
 for this chart. 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:01.360
 So x = -1; let me draw 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:08.010
 the vertical asymmetry - it will look like this. 

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:10.080
 And now, to see what the chart is doing, 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.630
 we can try with several values. 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:16.270
 What happens when x = 0? 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:20.580
 When x = 0, we have 2 at 0, which is 0, 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.800
 on (0 + 1). 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.700
 Which is 0 on 1, which is 0. 

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:31.560
 The point (0; 0) is on our curve. 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:34.990
 What happens when x = 1? 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:38.860
 We have 2 by 1, which is 2 on (1 + 1). 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:41.040
 Or 2 on 2, which is 1. 

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:43.470
 That is, (1; 1) is also on our graph. 

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:45.380
 That's on our schedule. 

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:46.910
 We can continue to score points, 

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:49.010
 but we know that the curve will look like something like that. 

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:52.240
 It seems that it tends to minus infinity, 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.450
 when approaching the vertical asymmetry on the right. 

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:58.500
 So in this direction it tends to minus infinity. 

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:02.160
 And then our horizontal asymptotic approach 

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.975
 from the negative direction. 

00:06:03.975 --> 00:06:07.100
 It will look like this. 

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:14.460
 And now, let's do this in a darker color, 

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:16.525
 for example in red. 

00:06:16.525 --> 00:06:20.280
 What happens when x = -2? 

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:24.640
 We have -2 at 2, which is -4. 

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:28.420
 We have -4 

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:32.660
 on (-2 + 1) or on -1, 

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:34.760
 which is just 4. 

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:36.810
 That is, we have (-2; 4). 

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:39.940
 (-2; 4). 

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:43.460
 (-2; 4) is on the graph. 

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:46.560
 Let's make one more point. 

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:48.670
 Let's try -3. 

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:51.536
 We'll get the -3 point 

00:06:51.536 --> 00:06:55.850
 2 on -3 is -6, on (-3 + 1), 

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:57.570
 which is -2. 

00:06:57.570 --> 00:07:01.290
 -6 on -2 is +3. 

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:04.050
 We are looking for a point (-3; 3). 

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:05.790
 1, 2, 3. 

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:07.090
 1, 2, 3. 

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:08.660
 Here it is. 

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:14.220
 The graphics will look like something. 

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:17.000
 When x tends to minus infinity, 

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.170
 our graph will approach the horizontal asymmetry from above. 

00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:23.745
 When x climbs to -1, 

00:07:23.745 --> 00:07:26.270
 the function will tend towards plus infinity. 

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:29.320
 Let's make sure once again that this is true 

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:31.240
 is the graph of our function. 

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:35.780
 Let's get our graph of function graphs. 

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:45.910
 We will define y as 2x / (x + 1) 

00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:51.190
 is equal to (we delete all this and we want to plot that) ... 

00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:53.070
 Here. It looks exactly like 

00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:54.700
 our schedule. 

00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:57.430
 And this vertical asymptote - the calculator linked the points, 

00:07:57.430 --> 00:07:59.240
 but we know that our function here is undefined. 

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:01.030
 The calculator just tried to connect 

00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:02.600
 extremely positive values ​​down. 

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:04.960
 What the calculator does is yes 

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:07.530
 create a detailed set of values 

00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:09.460
 and simply link all the points. 

00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:11.510
 He does not know that this is asymptote, 

00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:13.430
 so he tried to join the dots. 

00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:16.350
 But they must not be connected. 

00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:19.190
 I hope this example has been useful to you.
