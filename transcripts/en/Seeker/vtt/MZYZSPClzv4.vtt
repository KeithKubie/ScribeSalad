00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.380
I’ve heard that type A personalities are
intense and type B personalities are more

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:05.380
chill.

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:07.450
But I’m really intense about my chilling.

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:08.920
WHAT AM I???

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:14.599
Hey A’s and B’s, Julian here for DNews.

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:18.570
I remember a time before the Myers-Briggs
Type Indicator was all the rage when people

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.100
neatly classified themselves in two categories.

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.480
You were either type A or type B.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.040
Traditionally, type A’s are competitive,
driven, hard workers.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:31.010
They are bossy, impatient, eat fast, and interrupt
people.

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:32.110
Type B’s are the opposite.

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.150
They’re more relaxed, living for the moment,
and apparently slow eaters.

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.950
In other words, type A’s are there to win,
while type B’s are just happy to be out

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:40.950
there.

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.130
The two personality types were defined in
the ‘50s by doctors Meyer Friedman and Ray

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:47.719
Rosenman, but they weren’t psychologists,
they were cardiologists.

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:51.899
So what, you may be wondering, were a couple
of heart doctors doing defining personality

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:52.899
types?

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:56.270
Well when they were conducting their research,
they were exploring if certain personality

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.989
traits increased someone’s risk of heart
disease.

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:02.899
For eight and a half years they followed over
3000 middle aged men, who were divided almost

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:06.459
evenly into the two personality types based
on a questionnaire they answered.

00:01:06.459 --> 00:01:11.200
Their results, published in 1976, found that
type A people were almost twice as likely

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.079
to develop coronary heart disease than type
B people.

00:01:14.079 --> 00:01:16.259
The finding isn’t without its controversies
though.

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.409
Aside from the fact that precisely zero women
participated, the motives behind this study

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:22.279
have been called into question.

00:01:22.279 --> 00:01:26.189
In 2012 the American Journal of Public Health
published a paper by Dr. Mark Petticrew and

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.149
others of the London School of Hygiene and
Tropical Medicine.

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:32.891
In it Petticrew claims that after analyzing
documents from the tobacco industry, they

00:01:32.891 --> 00:01:37.770
concluded that research on the type A behavior
pattern were funded by tobacco companies in

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.899
an effort to confound the link between smoking
and heart disease.

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:45.169
And a 2001 meta-analysis by Michael Myrtek
published in the International Journal of

00:01:45.169 --> 00:01:49.119
Cardiology found that while hostility does
seem to have an association with coronary

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:54.319
heart disease, the effect size is so small
it’s not significant for prediction or prevention.

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:58.829
In other words, just being irritable and combative
is not enough to be a major risk factor for

00:01:58.829 --> 00:01:59.829
a heart attack.

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:00.829
Of course if you fit the Type A personality
scheme and you turn to smoking to cope with

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:01.829
the stress, that’s bad news for your heart.

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:02.829
Actually, even without the stress, smoking
is bad, m’kay?

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:03.829
And it should be added that you probably don’t
fit neatly into either type A’s or type

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:04.829
B’s little boxes.

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:09.140
There are more than two types of people in
the world, it’s ok to #breakthrerules.

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.510
Maybe sometimes you’re intense about your
play.

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.560
The new Toyota Tacoma encourages you to break
the rules, and PLAY NOW.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.069
After a ten-year wait, the all-new Tacoma
is finally here.

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:21.520
It’s been fully redesigned to play whenever
and wherever you want.

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.090
People love to define their personalities.

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.310
There are a plethora of free tests online
available and right now the Myers-Briggs Type

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.620
Indicator is so widespread that it’s used
by most fortune 100 companies when they’re

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:32.890
hiring people.

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.450
But it’s not based in science.

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.530
For a better personality breakdown, you need
the Big 5, and Laci explains what those are

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:48.060
here.

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.159
So here’s a fun little experiment we can
do.

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:54.680
I hypothesize that people who identify as
type A personalities, due to their eager and

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.959
competitive traits, are more likely to reply
to this video now that I’ve called them

00:02:58.959 --> 00:02:59.959
out.

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:02.280
Let us know if you think you’re an A or
B in the comments, subscribe for more, and

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.599
I’ll see you next time on DNews.
