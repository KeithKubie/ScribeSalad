00:00:01.251 --> 00:00:02.919
- Bladesmiths,

00:00:02.919 --> 00:00:04.713
the steel that you need in
this first round of competition

00:00:04.713 --> 00:00:05.296
from these.

00:00:09.592 --> 00:00:11.636
Will pulled the cover
off of these things,

00:00:11.636 --> 00:00:14.556
and I have one word
that comes to mind--

00:00:14.556 --> 00:00:16.516
[bleep]

00:00:16.516 --> 00:00:18.393
Today you'll have
to harvest the steel

00:00:18.393 --> 00:00:21.896
you need to make your blades
from these motorcycles.

00:00:21.896 --> 00:00:24.274
You will have three
hours in this round.

00:00:24.274 --> 00:00:27.736
The length of your blades
must be between 9 to 11 inches

00:00:27.736 --> 00:00:29.195
long, not including the tang.

00:00:29.195 --> 00:00:30.905
The overall length
of your weapon

00:00:30.905 --> 00:00:33.658
must not exceed 22 inches.

00:00:33.658 --> 00:00:34.701
Good luck, bladesmiths.

00:00:34.701 --> 00:00:39.456
Your three hours starts now.

00:00:39.456 --> 00:00:40.623
[bleep]

00:00:40.623 --> 00:00:42.375
It's pretty nerve
wracking knowing

00:00:42.375 --> 00:00:44.586
you're going to have to make
something off of a motorcycle.

00:00:44.586 --> 00:00:46.880
First thing that comes to
mind, probably take something

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.674
like the chain, which has
a good nickel content,

00:00:49.674 --> 00:00:51.676
make a utility camping knife.

00:00:51.676 --> 00:00:53.553
Simple, holds up good.

00:00:53.553 --> 00:00:56.473
Canister Damascus comes to mind
because that would incorporate

00:00:56.473 --> 00:00:59.100
pieces off of the motorcycle,
which is a requirement,

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.977
but also give you
enough high carbon

00:01:00.977 --> 00:01:04.147
steel from another source to
hopefully get a decent billet

00:01:04.147 --> 00:01:05.482
to make a blade.

00:01:05.482 --> 00:01:06.816
I've got a heck of a temper.

00:01:06.816 --> 00:01:08.443
I'm going to try my
best to not lose it

00:01:08.443 --> 00:01:12.572
if something goes wrong, but
I can't promise anything.

00:01:12.572 --> 00:01:14.616
Pretty much everybody is
going with the same idea.

00:01:14.616 --> 00:01:16.910
Canister Damascus is one
of your only options.

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:18.870
Jonathan, I didn't see
him use any white out

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:20.538
on his Canister Damascus.

00:01:20.538 --> 00:01:24.209
I don't know that he has
experience doing [inaudible]..

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:25.210
Hurry up and wait.

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:26.961
Hurry up and wait, brother.

00:01:26.961 --> 00:01:29.672
I'm stressed out about whether
or not that Canister Damascus

00:01:29.672 --> 00:01:31.591
is going to come out
in one uniform billet,

00:01:31.591 --> 00:01:33.760
or if it's going to come out
with spider webs and cracks

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.220
all in it.
OK.

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.055
Let's make some sparks.

00:01:37.055 --> 00:01:39.015
I'm cutting the
side of it off.

00:01:39.015 --> 00:01:42.393
I am prying at it with
a chisel and a hammer.

00:01:42.393 --> 00:01:43.520
Nothing's happening.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:44.729
Nothing's working.

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.898
I don't like it when
things go wrong.

00:01:46.898 --> 00:01:48.441
[bleep]

00:01:48.441 --> 00:01:51.820
So I just start prying at
it as hard as I can go,

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.155
and little by little, I
get the four sides off.

00:01:54.155 --> 00:01:55.698
OK.

00:01:55.698 --> 00:01:58.159
Start drawing it out,
thinking everything's great.

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:01.329
Next thing I know,
there's cracks everywhere.

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:04.290
[bleep]

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.378
My only plan is kind
of going to crap.

00:02:08.378 --> 00:02:10.255
The clock's ticking.

00:02:10.255 --> 00:02:10.797
He's in trouble.

00:02:14.676 --> 00:02:16.928
So I'm staring at a
pile of metal chunks.

00:02:16.928 --> 00:02:19.055
So I've got to come
up with another plan.

00:02:19.055 --> 00:02:21.641
Jonathan, he's
going for more parts?

00:02:21.641 --> 00:02:23.268
He's going for the
other part of that disk.

00:02:23.268 --> 00:02:24.769
Looks like he's
starting from scratch.

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:26.563
Holy--

00:02:26.563 --> 00:02:29.983
So I start drawing
out my blade shape

00:02:29.983 --> 00:02:32.610
and I'm actually making up
some of the time I lost.

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.989
Jonathan's moving that
piece of steel very quickly.

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:37.615
Then I look down, and
that knife doesn't look

00:02:37.615 --> 00:02:39.284
like anything I have ever made.

00:02:39.284 --> 00:02:43.246
And I don't know if it'll
actually harden at the quench.

00:02:43.246 --> 00:02:52.922
10, nine, eight, seven,
six, five, four, three, two.

00:02:52.922 --> 00:02:54.549
one.

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:57.051
Bladesmiths, shut down your
machines, drop your tools.

00:02:57.051 --> 00:02:58.928
This round is over.

00:02:58.928 --> 00:03:00.263
Huge mistake.

00:03:00.263 --> 00:03:02.348
That blade wasn't
even 1,100 degrees when

00:03:02.348 --> 00:03:04.392
he popped it in [inaudible].

00:03:04.392 --> 00:03:07.061
Bladesmiths, in this
first round of competition,

00:03:07.061 --> 00:03:09.272
you were to source the
steel that you needed

00:03:09.272 --> 00:03:10.607
from a pair of motorcycles.

00:03:10.607 --> 00:03:12.066
Now it's time for
the judges to take

00:03:12.066 --> 00:03:13.776
a closer look at your work.

00:03:13.776 --> 00:03:15.236
Andy, you're up first.

00:03:15.236 --> 00:03:19.198
Please present your
blade to the judges.

00:03:19.198 --> 00:03:21.075
I understand this was
your first canister weld?

00:03:21.075 --> 00:03:22.827
- Yes, sir, it was.
- It's beautiful.

00:03:22.827 --> 00:03:24.245
There is warp.

00:03:24.245 --> 00:03:26.331
It starts right about there.

00:03:26.331 --> 00:03:29.667
But, I mean, it is
one solid piece.

00:03:29.667 --> 00:03:31.252
Well done.

00:03:31.252 --> 00:03:35.548
Jordan, please present
your blade to the judges.

00:03:35.548 --> 00:03:37.842
Well, Jordan, I do like
the shape of your knife.

00:03:37.842 --> 00:03:39.552
One question I have for you.

00:03:39.552 --> 00:03:41.638
You file checked after
quenching in water.

00:03:41.638 --> 00:03:43.014
How did you think
it was ever going

00:03:43.014 --> 00:03:45.433
to get harder than
heating it up that hot

00:03:45.433 --> 00:03:47.185
and quenching it in water?

00:03:47.185 --> 00:03:50.647
I figured I might as well make
a giant fireball to go out in.

00:03:50.647 --> 00:03:53.024
I'm just really concerned
about that quench, especially

00:03:53.024 --> 00:03:54.692
that last going back in there.

00:03:54.692 --> 00:03:59.197
I mean, fireballs are cool,
but hard blades are cooler.

00:03:59.197 --> 00:04:00.531
Jonathan, you're up.

00:04:00.531 --> 00:04:01.741
Please present your
blade to the judges.

00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:06.287
Well, Jonathan, the
handle is comfortable.

00:04:06.287 --> 00:04:07.872
I like the swell at the back.

00:04:07.872 --> 00:04:10.750
You quenched towards the end.
Let's hope it's hard.

00:04:13.586 --> 00:04:16.589
Bladesmiths, the judges have
completed their deliberation

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:18.549
and they've made
a final decision.

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:20.385
The bladesmith
leaving the forge is--

00:04:24.931 --> 00:04:26.057
Jordan.

00:04:26.057 --> 00:04:27.558
Your blade did not make the cut.

00:04:27.558 --> 00:04:29.269
Ben Abbott's going
to tell you why.

00:04:29.269 --> 00:04:31.938
Well, Jordan, unfortunately
your last attempt at a quench

00:04:31.938 --> 00:04:33.147
failed to harden your blade.

00:04:33.147 --> 00:04:34.857
You turned in a soft blade.

00:04:34.857 --> 00:04:37.235
Although you and Jonathan
both missed a parameter,

00:04:37.235 --> 00:04:40.071
your flaws would be far more
difficult to fix in round two.

00:04:40.071 --> 00:04:42.031
So Jonathan lucks out this time.

00:04:42.031 --> 00:04:44.492
But, unfortunately, we're
going to have to let you go.

00:04:44.492 --> 00:04:47.328
Jordan please
surrender your blade.

00:04:47.328 --> 00:04:49.622
I agree with the
judge's decision 100%.

00:04:49.622 --> 00:04:51.666
I wasn't expecting
the other blades

00:04:51.666 --> 00:04:53.251
to get hard like they did.

00:04:53.251 --> 00:04:55.920
At some point in
the future, I sure

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.840
do hope that my name
will be listed among some

00:04:58.840 --> 00:04:59.841
of the best bladesmiths.
