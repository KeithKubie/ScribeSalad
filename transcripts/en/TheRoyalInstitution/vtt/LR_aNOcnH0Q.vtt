00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:10.019
Particle accelerators are machines that take
electric and magnetic fields,

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.400
and use them to accelerate beams of particles to almost the speed of light.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.770
Controlling and focusing beams like that
is a bit of a challenge,

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:21.840
but it we can do it, we can use them not just
for scientific research,

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.090
but also say, in hospitals to generate x-rays
and proton beams for cancer treatment,

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.450
and loads of other industries as well.

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:34.300
This is a very visual demonstration of how
we can control and focus particles.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.540
It's called a Paul trap, after the inventor
Wolfgang Paul.

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.800
Imagine you're riding on a beam of particles
in an accelerator.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.930
This saddle shape is analogous to the effect
of the magnetic field as it comes up to a

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:48.290
focusing magnet.

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:52.340
If it's too far over to one side, it'll get
pushed back to the centre.

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.110
To far to this side, it'll get pushed back
to the centre.

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:01.239
But, it can't focus in both directions at
once, so if I were to just let this go...

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:02.600
it's going to fall off.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:03.600
It's unstable.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.889
It turns out you can't focus a beam of particles
in both directions at the same time with either

00:01:08.889 --> 00:01:11.609
a static electric or magnetic field.

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:17.350
But we can focus beams in an accelerator,
and the way we do it is by alternating the

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.539
gradient of the field in time.

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:26.310
In this demonstration, we do it by spinning
the device.

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.740
The thing to note here is we have to get the
forces right and at the right time.

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:37.719
For example, if I rotate this any slower,
the particle will fall off.

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:45.319
And it's gonna fly off quite explosively if
I drop it in when it's going any faster.

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:50.310
By rotating the saddle we're alternating between
focussing and defocusing effect,

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.380
which is very similar to the effect of quadrupole
magnets in an accelerator.

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.539
That's a pretty crude model of a Paul trap,
but we can use a bit more of a sophisticated

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:11.599
setup to look at the beam motion in accelerators
in a bit more detail.

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:18.629
This is a quadrupole linear Paul trap and
it has four rods on which we put an AC oscillating

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:21.849
potential on each opposing pair of the rods

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:24.319
in order to provide the focusing.

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:28.599
Into there, between the four rods I'm going
to place some pollen particles.

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:32.760
I'm just going to charge up some particles
using a Teflon wand,

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.799
which I'll charge with static electricity.

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:45.620
What we're looking at is a bunch of pollen
particles which are trapped by the oscillating

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.400
AC fields.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.610
If those fields were static, the particles
would just fly off in one direction or another,

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:58.640
but because we're oscillating them at the
right voltage and with the right freqency,

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.900
we actually manage to set up a stable region
where the particles can remain more or less

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.050
indefinitely in the centre.

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:12.260
Even when they have an amplitude that's not
zero they're still stable in the centre.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:18.430
So they're moving inwards and outwards but
alternating between vertical and horizontal,

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:23.120
so when they move outwards vertically they
move inwards horizontally.

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:29.160
So the way that they're oscillating back and
forth, vertically and horizontally, is very

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.079
much like the movement of the beam in the
accelerator

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:38.079
But it's as if we're sitting on top of the
beam as we move through it as we move through it

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:40.150
rather than seeing the beam move along.

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.440
So that's why it looks stationary.

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:50.040
Turning down either the voltage or the frequency
is like slowing down the speed of the rotating

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:55.140
saddle trap that we had before.

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.940
This is not just a really beautiful demonstration,

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:01.819
but in my research, I've actually built a more precise version of this,

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:07.659
trapping actual ions so we can study some
of the properties of beams in real accelerators,

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:12.310
and using that we can study new types of accelerators
before they've even been built.
