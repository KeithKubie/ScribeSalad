shows a 2d crystal at higher resolution
 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:48.800
shows a 2d crystal at higher resolution
because the 2d crystals were easier to

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810
because the 2d crystals were easier to
 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.230
because the 2d crystals were easier to
start with which is how I'll start so

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:51.240
start with which is how I'll start so
 

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:53.330

about six times bigger magnification

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870
about six times bigger magnification
 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.360
about six times bigger magnification
than the images at the top but you can

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370
than the images at the top but you can
 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.610
than the images at the top but you can
see and it's this is so this is much

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620
see and it's this is so this is much
 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.370
see and it's this is so this is much
easier to understand and the

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380
easier to understand and the
 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:06.470
easier to understand and the

so you just take images of the molecules

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340
so you just take images of the molecules
 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.970
so you just take images of the molecules
you can see them and then in the

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980
you can see them and then in the
 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.070
you can see them and then in the
computer you calculate the structure so

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:13.080
computer you calculate the structure so
 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:17.500
computer you calculate the structure so
you know anyone can do this kind of work

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:17.510
you know anyone can do this kind of work
 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:20.449

original plan had been to dissolve them
in detergent make 3d crystals or analyze

00:08:09.679 --> 00:08:09.689
in detergent make 3d crystals or analyze
 

00:08:09.689 --> 00:08:12.019
in detergent make 3d crystals or analyze
the 2d pattern and this is an x-ray

00:08:12.019 --> 00:08:12.029
the 2d pattern and this is an x-ray
 

00:08:12.029 --> 00:08:13.489
the 2d pattern and this is an x-ray
powder pattern from

00:08:13.489 --> 00:08:13.499
powder pattern from
 

00:08:13.499 --> 00:08:17.029
powder pattern from
stacks pellets of those same membranes

00:08:17.029 --> 00:08:17.039
stacks pellets of those same membranes
 

00:08:17.039 --> 00:08:20.719
stacks pellets of those same membranes
that you saw in single sheets and so

00:08:20.719 --> 00:08:20.729
that you saw in single sheets and so
 

00:08:20.729 --> 00:08:23.089
that you saw in single sheets and so
there are lots of spots you can see they

00:08:23.089 --> 00:08:23.099
there are lots of spots you can see they
 

00:08:23.099 --> 00:08:25.369
there are lots of spots you can see they
go out this would be the one the first

00:08:25.369 --> 00:08:25.379
go out this would be the one the first
 

00:08:25.379 --> 00:08:27.439
go out this would be the one the first
spot second third and so on and this is

00:08:27.439 --> 00:08:27.449
spot second third and so on and this is
 

00:08:27.449 --> 00:08:29.389
spot second third and so on and this is
about seven angstrom resolution they're

00:08:29.389 --> 00:08:29.399
about seven angstrom resolution they're
 

00:08:29.399 --> 00:08:31.249
about seven angstrom resolution they're
all very strong but you can see them all

00:08:31.249 --> 00:08:31.259
all very strong but you can see them all
 

00:08:31.259 --> 00:08:32.929
all very strong but you can see them all
going out and you can index them right

00:08:32.929 --> 00:08:32.939
going out and you can index them right
 

00:08:32.939 --> 00:08:35.269
going out and you can index them right
oh right the way out to three or four

00:08:35.269 --> 00:08:35.279
oh right the way out to three or four
 

00:08:35.279 --> 00:08:37.009
oh right the way out to three or four
angstrom resolution so that showed that

00:08:37.009 --> 00:08:37.019
angstrom resolution so that showed that
 

00:08:37.019 --> 00:08:39.799
angstrom resolution so that showed that
these 2d crystals were really highly

00:08:39.799 --> 00:08:39.809
these 2d crystals were really highly
 

00:08:39.809 --> 00:08:42.049
these 2d crystals were really highly
ordered and very suitable for structural

00:08:42.049 --> 00:08:42.059
ordered and very suitable for structural
 

00:08:42.059 --> 00:08:44.360
ordered and very suitable for structural
analysis and at that point I had the

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:44.370
analysis and at that point I had the
 

00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:47.720
analysis and at that point I had the
great good fortune to meet Nigel Unwin

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:47.730
great good fortune to meet Nigel Unwin
 

00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:49.879
great good fortune to meet Nigel Unwin
who had been giving a talk about

00:08:49.879 --> 00:08:49.889
who had been giving a talk about
 

00:08:49.889 --> 00:08:52.400
who had been giving a talk about
electron microscopy using negative stain

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:52.410
electron microscopy using negative stain
 

00:08:52.410 --> 00:08:54.800
electron microscopy using negative stain
but in that talk it was clear he

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:54.810
but in that talk it was clear he
 

00:08:54.810 --> 00:08:57.319
but in that talk it was clear he
thinking about how the images would also

00:08:57.319 --> 00:08:57.329
thinking about how the images would also
 

00:08:57.329 --> 00:08:59.929
thinking about how the images would also
contain inside the stain the images of

00:08:59.929 --> 00:08:59.939
contain inside the stain the images of
 

00:08:59.939 --> 00:09:01.699
contain inside the stain the images of
the proteins that were being encased in

it so we work together for two or three

00:09:05.059 --> 00:09:05.069
it so we work together for two or three
 

00:09:05.069 --> 00:09:08.090
it so we work together for two or three
years doing on these little patches that

00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:08.100
years doing on these little patches that
 

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:10.249
years doing on these little patches that
would be one of these crystals electron

00:09:10.249 --> 00:09:10.259
would be one of these crystals electron
 

00:09:10.259 --> 00:09:12.559

00:09:12.569 --> 00:09:14.480

before we managed to do any better with
 

00:11:46.930 --> 00:11:52.620
before we managed to do any better with
this so then we went on and tried to go

00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:52.630
this so then we went on and tried to go
 

00:11:52.630 --> 00:11:54.810
this so then we went on and tried to go

was one of the critical problems that we

00:15:57.470 --> 00:15:57.480
was one of the critical problems that we
 

00:15:57.480 --> 00:15:59.300
was one of the critical problems that we
hadn't realized and I'll figure out a

00:15:59.300 --> 00:15:59.310
hadn't realized and I'll figure out a
 

00:15:59.310 --> 00:16:02.180
hadn't realized and I'll figure out a
way in tilted specimens to correct for

with improved maps so eventually from

then the first 50 images gave us a map

00:16:36.890 --> 00:16:36.900
then the first 50 images gave us a map
 

00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:39.350
then the first 50 images gave us a map
with more better resolve features and

that was about 1990 and it was the first

could use electron microscopy to
determine the structures so then we went

00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:23.220
determine the structures so then we went
 

00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:27.949

00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:51.379
and I then became completely convinced
that the e/m method was definitely the

we had new analytical methods tilt pairs
 

00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:50.030
we had new analytical methods tilt pairs
and so on that proved that this was

and so on that proved that this was
 

00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:52.010
and so on that proved that this was
correct but as soon as the new detectors

00:21:52.010 --> 00:21:52.020
correct but as soon as the new detectors
 

00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:54.230
correct but as soon as the new detectors
came in here we had higher resolution

00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:54.240
came in here we had higher resolution
 

00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:56.990
came in here we had higher resolution
and then with new programs such as rely

longer than typical projects take so

00:28:31.259 --> 00:28:31.269
longer than typical projects take so
 

00:28:31.269 --> 00:28:34.030
