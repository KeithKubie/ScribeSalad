00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.870
&gt;&gt; Okay, Michael, so you seemed like you knew what you were doing

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:06.800
so I thought I would verify that by giving you a very easy quiz.

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.109
&gt;&gt; This doesn't look so easy.

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:12.800
&gt;&gt; It is easy, so here's the quiz. To help you I've written up both the

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:19.320
Bellmans equation and the update that we would give to utilities. I neglected

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.350
to write the little hats and everything because I just don't think you need that

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.470
but these are the two equations that you need to be able to think about.

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.500
This is just what we've written up before. And I've written down the

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.960
grid world we've been playing with the entire time. And I want you to

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.760
figure out how value iteration would work from the first iteration and the

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.750
second iteration for this particular state here that I marked with an X, okay?

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:41.840
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.920
&gt;&gt; Alright, and there are a little more information you

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.530
need to go. Gamma in this case is going to be

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.540
equal to one half. Mainly because it's easy to do

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.150
the math if you do it that way. The rewards,

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:54.830
just to remind you, for all of the states except for the two goal

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:56.775
or absorbing states is going to be minus

00:00:56.775 --> 00:01:01.090
0.04. And my initial arbitrary utilities for

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:05.620
all of the states, is going to be 0, except in the two absorbing

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:10.454
states where I already know the utilities are 1 and minus 1 respectively, Okay?

00:01:10.454 --> 00:01:10.750
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:11.610
&gt;&gt; You got all that?

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.310
&gt;&gt; I think so.

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:14.155
&gt;&gt; You sure?

00:01:14.155 --> 00:01:16.540
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I feel confident

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:22.240
that I'm going to slip up, but Okay, yeah, I think I can take a stab at this.

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.394
&gt;&gt; Alright, so gamma's one half, rewards are minus 0.04, arbitrary

00:01:26.394 --> 00:01:30.146
starting utilities at times 0 is 0, except here at the absorbing

00:01:30.146 --> 00:01:34.800
states. Tell me how the utility here will evolve after one step,

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.590
or one iteration, and two steps, or two iterations. Okay then, go.
