00:00:00.531 --> 00:00:02.551
- Hello, your Majesty,
what can I help you with?

00:00:02.551 --> 00:00:06.417
Oh Sal, I have such an emergency.

00:00:06.417 --> 00:00:09.390
I have commissioned a gold statue

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:12.895
of my father's head, and I'm not sure

00:00:12.895 --> 00:00:15.459
if it's the right size.

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:19.640
Oh, well what is the right size?

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.204
Well as you know, in our kingdom we have

00:00:23.204 --> 00:00:25.258
a tradition of measuring things

00:00:25.258 --> 00:00:28.161
in terms of blue fuzzy squares.

00:00:28.161 --> 00:00:29.182
Yep, I'm aware of that.

00:00:29.182 --> 00:00:30.881
I also like to measure things

00:00:30.881 --> 00:00:32.982
in terms of blue fuzzy squares.

00:00:32.982 --> 00:00:37.982
And by law, all gold
statues in our kingdom

00:00:38.521 --> 00:00:43.521
have to be exactly four
blue fuzzy squares tall.

00:00:45.044 --> 00:00:47.262
Okay, that seems like a reasonable law.

00:00:47.262 --> 00:00:48.277
So what's the issue?

00:00:48.277 --> 00:00:50.075
Well I'm not sure if this statue

00:00:50.075 --> 00:00:53.558
is four blue fuzzy squares tall.

00:00:53.558 --> 00:00:55.880
Well okay, let's calm down.

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.552
I think we can work through this.

00:00:57.552 --> 00:00:59.670
I have a bunch of blue fuzzy squares here.

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.270
Why don't we put them next to the statue

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:05.753
and see if we are exactly four

00:01:05.753 --> 00:01:07.576
blue fuzzy squares tall.

00:01:07.576 --> 00:01:09.793
Oh, that would be just wonderful.

00:01:09.793 --> 00:01:11.905
Here you go, here you go, your Highness.

00:01:12.997 --> 00:01:15.534
Why don't you stack them up?

00:01:15.534 --> 00:01:18.160
Oh so let me do this, okay.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:23.160
So that's one, two, and three blue fuzz--

00:01:25.184 --> 00:01:27.111
Oh my God, this is an emergency!

00:01:27.111 --> 00:01:29.550
This is only three blue
fuzzy squares tall!

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.093
It is not tall enough!

00:01:31.093 --> 00:01:32.405
Oh no, what am I going to do?

00:01:32.405 --> 00:01:35.101
Oh wait, hold on, hold on.

00:01:35.101 --> 00:01:38.040
I don't think you have to panic just yet

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.570
because when I look at
how you stacked them up,

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:42.933
and it's actually quite amazing

00:01:42.933 --> 00:01:44.930
because you somehow made these

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:46.438
blue fuzzy squares levitate.

00:01:46.438 --> 00:01:48.354
Oh, of course, all blue fuzzy squares

00:01:48.354 --> 00:01:49.608
need to levitate.

00:01:49.608 --> 00:01:51.918
Okay, well yeah, that's neat.

00:01:51.918 --> 00:01:53.067
But if you really wanted to measure,

00:01:53.067 --> 00:01:53.721
you need to make sure that you

00:01:53.721 --> 00:01:56.073
don't have any gaps over here.

00:01:56.073 --> 00:01:57.337
So why don't you try again?

00:01:57.337 --> 00:02:00.158
So let's take these
blue fuzzy squares out,

00:02:00.158 --> 00:02:02.005
and why don't you try to measure again.

00:02:02.005 --> 00:02:04.915
Oh, okay, now that makes
all the sense in the world.

00:02:04.915 --> 00:02:07.052
Okay, so let me try again.

00:02:07.052 --> 00:02:12.052
So that's one, two, notice
I'm not letting them,

00:02:12.834 --> 00:02:13.994
no gaps here.

00:02:13.994 --> 00:02:16.323
Yep, yep, okay, although
it's already, well--

00:02:16.323 --> 00:02:17.533
Well let me keep going Sal,

00:02:17.533 --> 00:02:18.723
stop interrupting me.

00:02:18.723 --> 00:02:21.149
Okay, okay, keep going, your Highness.

00:02:21.149 --> 00:02:26.149
Three, four, and five.

00:02:28.592 --> 00:02:31.168
Oh no, oh no, no, no, this is all wrong!

00:02:31.168 --> 00:02:32.990
It's going to be a disaster!

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:34.743
It needs to be four, not five

00:02:34.743 --> 00:02:35.928
blue fuzzy squares tall!

00:02:35.928 --> 00:02:38.192
Wait, wait, your
Highness, don't panic yet.

00:02:38.192 --> 00:02:39.306
I don't think this is quite right

00:02:39.306 --> 00:02:43.148
because you didn't start at the bottom

00:02:43.148 --> 00:02:45.192
of the statue, you
started below the bottom

00:02:45.192 --> 00:02:46.631
of the statue, and you didn't end

00:02:46.631 --> 00:02:48.407
at the top of the statue, you ended

00:02:48.407 --> 00:02:50.266
above the top of the statue.

00:02:50.266 --> 00:02:52.831
So it isn't five blue fuzzy squares tall.

00:02:52.831 --> 00:02:55.129
Oh Sal, I'm just so confused.

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:56.709
Can you just do it for me?

00:02:57.478 --> 00:02:59.069
Well I think it's better
if you do it yourself.

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:03.272
Just keep it in mind, start measuring

00:03:03.272 --> 00:03:04.887
at the bottom of the statue,

00:03:04.887 --> 00:03:07.244
and stop measuring at
the top of the statue.

00:03:07.244 --> 00:03:08.566
Just make sure that you don't have

00:03:08.566 --> 00:03:09.972
any spaces in between.

00:03:09.972 --> 00:03:12.944
Okay, I'm getting tired, but I'll give it

00:03:12.944 --> 00:03:14.987
one last try.

00:03:14.987 --> 00:03:17.409
Yeah, I think that's a good idea.

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:21.565
It's always about making
a good effort on things.

00:03:21.565 --> 00:03:23.724
Okay, here I go.

00:03:24.231 --> 00:03:28.734
This is the bottom, so
I'll start stacking there.

00:03:28.734 --> 00:03:32.333
This is the top, so I
will stop stacking there.

00:03:32.333 --> 00:03:37.333
Okay, one, two, and I don't want any gaps,

00:03:38.718 --> 00:03:43.718
so two, three, and four.

00:03:47.274 --> 00:03:50.652
Oh, it actually looks just about right.

00:03:50.652 --> 00:03:52.428
It looks just about right.

00:03:52.428 --> 00:03:57.428
We are exactly four
blue fuzzy squares tall.

00:03:59.011 --> 00:03:59.655
Oh this is just going to be

00:03:59.655 --> 00:04:03.069
a wonderful addition to the palace.

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:04.345
Thank you so much.

00:04:04.345 --> 00:04:07.166
Well I'm glad to help you, your Highness.
