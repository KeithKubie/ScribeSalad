00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.180
If we pop up a level you can make a
similar argument here which you sort of

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:05.840
made when you asked me that question,
all right.

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.350
You asked me the question before
we start the quiz which is,

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:11.770
well if I want to eat a big dot, I need
to avoid the ghosts along the way.

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:14.420
So maybe eating a big
dot eating a dot is

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:16.970
really requires that I
know almost everything.

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.470
Except, in the worst case, eating a big
dot doesn't require that over the little

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:23.870
dots are, even if I need to worry
about where the ghosts are and

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:24.730
whether they're scared or not.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:32.009
Although, if I know where
the dots are then I might

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.990
choose to eat the big dots in such a way
that eat a bunch of little dots as well.

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:39.220
But this is really a kind of,
this points out two things.

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.770
One, it sort of points out that
if my options are not written in

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.170
exactly the right way, then I may not
be able to find an optimum policy,

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.500
we'll talk about that in just a moment.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.310
But, if I worry about that,

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:56.059
then all of these options have
to solve every single problem.

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.610
And I kind of get nothing out of it.

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.330
I don't get a big win by even thinking
about it in terms of options because

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:05.099
effectively, I'm just trying
to solve the entire problem.

00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:07.660
The whole point of abstraction, it's
a kind of the Software Engineering and

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:11.870
Computing sense and here we are using
it, is that in part it allows you to do

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:16.850
an abstraction not just over time,
it allows you to do state abstraction.

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:18.470
And other kinds of abstraction.

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:19.960
So, what do I mean by
state abstraction here?

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.680
Well, if you look at the big dot case,

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.370
if I don't have to worry
about where the dots are,

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:27.880
never mind where the ghosts and
whether they're scared or not.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.820
That means that if I needed to learn
this policy, if I needed to figure out

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.170
how to most optimally solve
the problem of eating dots.

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.090
I can actually ignore large
parts of the state space.

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.100
What happens if I can ignore large
parts of the state space, Michael?

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.330
&gt;&gt; Then you can solve
the problems more efficiently.

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.110
&gt;&gt; Right in the very beginning we said
the thing that made reinforcement

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:52.280
learning hard is that as the number of
states grew, the problem became more and

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.700
more difficult, it was sort of super
linear in the number of states.

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.230
So if I can avoid whole features of
the states, that is I can collapse

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:03.210
states that are otherwise different
as if they were single state

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.820
where the dots are don't matter, then
the problem of learning this policy,

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.900
learning this option
actually becomes easier.

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:11.220
Both from a planning point of view and
from a learning point of view.

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.700
&gt;&gt; So
it's if the state space gets smaller?

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:14.212
&gt;&gt; Right.
So

00:02:14.212 --> 00:02:16.840
temporal abstraction doesn't
just buys temple abstraction.

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.290
It buys a state abstraction.

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.430
At least if we can divide
the world up appropriate.

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:22.520
&gt;&gt; Neat.
Okay.

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.160
I mean is there a guarantee
that we can always do that?

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.390
&gt;&gt; No.
There's not a guarantee that we

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:27.310
can always do that.

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.180
&gt;&gt; In the kinds of problems that people
can solve maybe it's pretty common

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.060
because people don't have infinite
computational resources either.

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.920
&gt;&gt; Right.
And in practice,

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.330
I mean, if you just even think about
the way you were describing things,

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.510
you sort of ignore large parts
of what's going on around you

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.360
in order to solve the problem, right?

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.020
We do these kinds of
things all the time.

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:50.250
It had better be the case that we can
ignore large parts of the state space

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:51.170
with otherwise,

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.360
we're in trouble it's going to very
difficult to move around in the world.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.465
I mean first off, the world upon DP so

00:02:55.465 --> 00:02:58.640
[LAUGH] we're ignoring large
parts of this database anyway.

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.270
But beyond that,

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:03.980
I'm in this room talking to you there
are things going on outside I can't see.

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:09.640
By and large I can mostly ignore them
at least for short periods of time.

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.880
And we just have to hope in the real
world that the parts of the state space

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.920
that might matter such as
I don't know a polar bear,

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.520
the location of the closest polar bear.

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.868
It will be announced to me
when that becomes relevant.

00:03:21.868 --> 00:03:23.304
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; And

00:03:23.304 --> 00:03:25.960
I can start paying attention to it,
in which case I'm going to stop worrying

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:31.990
about eating my big dots which is what
I call teaching this class and instead

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:34.850
start avoiding ghosts which is what
I call running away from polar bears.
