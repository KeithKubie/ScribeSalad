00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.640
In this video we're going
to talk a little bit about

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:04.720
order of operations.

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:07.310
And I want you to pay close
attention because really

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:09.570
everything else that you're
going to do in mathematics

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.630
is going to be based on you
having a solid grounding

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.150
in order of operations.

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.140
So what do we even mean when
we say order of operations?

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:18.640
So let me give you an example.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.780
The whole point is so that we
have one way to interpret

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:23.380
a mathematical statement.

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.660
So let's say I have the
mathematical statement

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:32.100
7 plus 3 times 5.

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:36.495
Now if we didn't all agree on
order of operations, there

00:00:36.495 --> 00:00:39.180
would be two ways of
interpreting this statement.

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.400
You could just read it left to
right, so you could say well,

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.030
let me just take 7 plus 3, you
could say 7 plus 3 and then

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.510
multiply that times 5.

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:56.090
And 7 plus 3 is 10, and then
you multiply that by 5.

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.500
10 times 5, it
would get you 50.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.180
So that's one way you would
interpret it if we didn't agree

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:03.310
on an order of operations.

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.925
Maybe it's a natural way.

00:01:03.925 --> 00:01:05.530
You just go left to right.

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:07.540
Another way you could interpret
it you say, I like to do

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.210
multiplication before
I do addition.

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.980
So you might interpret it as --
I'll try to color code it --

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:18.070
7 plus -- and you do
the 3 times 5 first.

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:26.550
7 plus 3 times 5, which would
be 7 plus 3 times 5 is

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.040
15, and 7 plus 15 is 22.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.860
So notice, we interpreted
this statement in

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:35.600
two different ways.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.140
This was just straight left
to right doing addition

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.680
then the multiplication.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.143
This way we did the
multiplication first then the

00:01:42.143 --> 00:01:44.540
addition, we got two different
answers, and that's just not

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:45.880
cool in mathematics.

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.910
If this was part of some effort
to send something to the moon

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.070
because two people interpreted
it a different way or another

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.170
one computer interpreted one
way and another computer

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.000
interpreted it another way, the
satellite might go to mars.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.730
So this is just completely
unacceptable, and that's why

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:02.920
we have to have an agreed
upon order of operations.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.540
An agreed upon way to
interpret this statement.

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.750
So the agreed upon order of
operations is to do parentheses

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:19.600
first -- let me write it over
here -- then do exponents.

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.140
If you don't know what
exponents are don't worry

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.220
about it right now.

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.550
In this video we're not going
to have any exponents in our

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.940
examples, so you don't
really have to worry about

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.020
them for this video.

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.140
Then you do multiplication --
I'll just right mult, short for

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.250
multiplication -- then you do
multiplication and division

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.260
next, they kind of have the
same level of priority.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.410
And then finally you do
addition and subtraction.

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.230
So what does this order of
operations -- let me label

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.990
it -- this right here,
that is the agreed upon

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:55.910
order of operations.

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.740
If we follow these order of
operations we should always

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.400
get to the same answer
for a given statement.

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.390
So what does this tell us?

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.070
What is the best way to
interpret this up here?

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:08.510
Well we have no parentheses --
parentheses look like that.

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.200
Those little curly
things around numbers.

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.870
We don't have any
parentheses here.

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.690
I'll do some examples that
do have parentheses.

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:16.380
We don't have any
exponents here.

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.670
But we do have some
multiplication and division

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.440
or we actually just have
some multiplication.

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.820
So we'll order of operations,
do the multiplication

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.420
and division first.

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.970
So it says do the
multiplication first.

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:29.080
That's a multiplication.

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:32.010
So it says do this
operation first.

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.500
It gets priority over
addition or subtraction.

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.390
So if we do this first we
get the 3 times 5, which is

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.870
15, and then we add the 7.

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.570
The addition or subtraction --
I'll do it here, addition,

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:46.470
we just have addition.

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:47.370
Just like that.

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.840
So we do the multiplication
first, get 15, then

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.920
add the 7, 22.

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:56.520
So based upon the agreed order
of operations, this right

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.770
here is the correct answer.

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:01.620
The correct way to
interpret this statement.

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.040
Let's do another example.

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.550
I think it'll make things a
little bit more clear, and

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:09.620
I'll do the example in pink.

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:19.063
So let's say I have 7 plus 3 --
I'll put some parentheses there

00:04:19.063 --> 00:04:29.980
-- times 4 divided by
2 minus 5 times 6.

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:32.890
So there's all sorts of crazy
things here, but if you just

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:36.670
follow the order of operations
you'll simplify it in a very

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:38.960
clean way and hopefully we'll
all get the same answer.

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.330
So let's just follow the
order of operations.

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.320
The first thing we have to
do is look for parentheses.

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:44.540
Are there parentheses here?

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:45.840
Yes, there are.

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.440
There's parentheses
around the 7 plus 3.

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.050
So it says let's do that first.

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:53.620
So 7 plus 3 is 10.

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:55.740
So this we can simplify,
just looking at this

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:59.280
order operations, to
10 times all of that.

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:00.900
Let me copy and paste
that so I don't have

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:02.310
to keep re-writing it.

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:09.310
So that simplifies to
10 times all of that.

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:12.000
We did our parentheses first.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.030
Then what do we do?

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:15.370
There are no more parentheses
in this expression.

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:16.630
Then we should do exponents.

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:19.105
I don't see any exponents here,
and if you're curious what

00:05:19.105 --> 00:05:20.650
exponents look like, an
exponent would look

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:22.890
like 7 squared.

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:25.240
You'd see these little small
numbers up in the top right.

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:26.880
We don't have any exponents
here so we don't have

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:28.130
to worry about it.

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:30.160
Then it says to do
multiplication and

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.400
division next.

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:33.890
So where do we see
multiplication?

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:36.470
We have a multiplication,
a division, a

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:38.520
multiplication again.

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:43.090
Now, when you have multiple
operations at the same level,

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:45.760
when our order of operations,
multiplication and division

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:50.230
are the same level, then
you do left to right.

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:54.010
So in this situation you're
going to multiply by 4

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:55.500
and then divide by 2.

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:59.710
You won't multiply
by 4 divided by 2.

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:02.200
Then we'll do the 5 times
6 before we do the

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:03.950
subtraction right here.

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:06.070
So let's figure
out what this is.

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:10.040
So we'll do this
multiplication first.

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:12.500
We could simultaneously do this
multiplication because it's

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:13.360
not going to change things.

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.570
But I'll do things
one step at a time.

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:19.840
So the next step we're going
to do is this 10 times 4.

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:23.160
10 times 4 is 40.

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:32.430
10 times 4 is 40, then you
have 40 divided by 2 and it

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:34.250
simplifies to that right there.

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:36.560
Remember, multiplication and
division, they're at the exact

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:39.520
same level so we're going
to do it left to right.

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:42.770
You could also express this as
multiplying by 1/2 and then it

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:43.820
wouldn't matter the order.

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:46.530
But for simplicity,
multiplication and division

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:48.960
go left to right.

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:52.860
So then you have 40 divided
by 2 minus 5 times 6.

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:55.100
So, division, you just
have one division here,

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:57.690
you want to do that.

00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:00.000
You have this division and you
have this multiplication,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.550
they're not together so you
can actually kind of do

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:03.020
them simultaneously.

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:05.600
And to make it clear that you
do this before you do the

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:08.460
subtraction because
multiplication and division

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:11.550
take priority over addition and
subtraction, we could put

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:13.940
parentheses around them to say
look, we're going to do that

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:18.490
and that first before I do that
subtraction, because

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:22.040
multiplication and
division have priority.

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:25.230
So 40 divided by 2 is 20.

00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:30.770
We're going to have that minus
sign, minus 5 times 6 is 30.

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:35.120
20 minus 30 is equal
to negative 10.

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:38.300
And that is the correct
interpretation of that.

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:41.010
So I want to make something
very, very, very clear.

00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:46.190
If you have things at the same
level, so if you have 1 plus

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:51.010
2 minus 3 plus 4 minus 1.

00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:53.830
So addition and subtraction are
all the same level in order of

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:57.200
operations, you should
go left to right.

00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:02.240
So you should interpret this as
1 plus 2 is 3, so this is the

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:05.680
same thing as 3 minus
3 plus 4 minus 1.

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:09.830
Then you do 3 minus 3
is 0 plus 4 minus 1.

00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:13.070
Or this is the same thing
as 4 minus 1, which is

00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:13.945
the same thing as 3.

00:08:13.945 --> 00:08:16.060
You just go left to right.

00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:20.620
Same thing if you have
multiplication and division,

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:21.930
they're at the same level.

00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:29.200
So if you have 4 times 2
divided by 3 times 2,

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:34.820
you do 4 times 2 is 8
divided by 3 times 2.

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:39.120
And you say 8 divided by 3 is,
well, we got a fraction there.

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:40.510
It would be 8/3.

00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:44.340
So this would be 8/3 times 2.

00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:50.430
And then 8/3 times to
is equal to 16 over 3.

00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:51.580
That's how you interpret it.

00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:54.460
You don't do this
multiplication first or divide

00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:56.140
the 2 by that and all of that.

00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:59.000
Now the one time where you can
be loosey-goosey with order of

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.840
operations, if you have all
addition or all multiplication.

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:09.110
So if you have 1 plus 5 plus 7
plus 3 plus 2, it does not

00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:10.590
matter what order you do it in.

00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:12.690
You can do the 2 plus 3, you
can go from the right to the

00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:14.360
left, you can go from the
left to the right, you could

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:15.610
start some place in between.

00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:17.470
If it's only all addition.

00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:20.030
And the same thing is true if
you have all multiplication.

00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:24.495
It's 1 times 5 times
7 times 3 times 2.

00:09:24.495 --> 00:09:27.280
It does not matter what
order you're doing it.

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:31.620
But it's only with all
multiplication or all addition.

00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:33.290
If there was some division
in here, if there's some

00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:36.460
subtraction in here, you're
best off just going

00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:38.420
left to right.
