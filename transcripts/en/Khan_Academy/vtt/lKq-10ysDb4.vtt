00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:03.760
SAL: In the last video, where
we talked about macrostates,

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:07.460
we set up this situation where
I had this canister, or the

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:09.980
cylinder, and had this
movable ceiling.

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:11.000
I call that a piston.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
And the piston is being kept
up by the pressure from the

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:15.905
gas in the canister.

00:00:15.905 --> 00:00:19.960
And it's being kept down by, in
the last example I had, a

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:21.520
rock or a weight on top.

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:22.820
And above that I had a vacuum.

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.090
So essentially there's some
force per area, or pressure,

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:27.790
being applied by the
bumps of the

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:30.260
particles into this piston.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.409
And if this weight wasn't here--
let's assume that the

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:35.920
piston itself or this movable
ceiling itself, it has no

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.490
mass-- if that weight wasn't
there it would just be pushed

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:41.000
indefinitely far, because
there'd be no pressure from

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.460
the vacuum.

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.360
But this weight is applying
some force on

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:45.960
that same area downwards.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.160
So we're at some equilibrium
point, some stability.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.430
And we plotted that on this
PV diagram right here.

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.910
I'll do it in magenta.

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.390
So that's our state 1 that
we were in right there.

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.410
And then what I did in the last
video, I just blew away

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:04.750
half of this block.

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.210
And as soon as I blew away half
of this block, obviously

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.080
the force that's being applied
by the block will immediately

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.660
go down by half, and so the
gas will push up on it.

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.900
And it happened so fast that,
al of a sudden the gas is

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:17.940
pushing up.

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.700
Right when it happens, the gas
near the top of the canister

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.260
is going to have lower pressure,
because it has less

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:24.250
pushing up against it.

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.560
The molecules that are down here
don't even know that I

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.010
blew away this block yet.

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:30.090
It's going to take some time.

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.280
And essentially the gas is going
to push it up, and then

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.950
maybe it'll oscillate down,
and then push it up, and

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:37.290
oscillate down a little bit.

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.910
It'll take some time eventually
until we get to

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:43.890
another equilibrium state, where
we have a new, probably,

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.510
or definitely lower pressure.

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:49.150
We definitely have
a higher volume.

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.300
I won't talk too much about it
yet, but we probably have a

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:52.960
lower temperature as well.

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.380
And this is our new state.

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.110
And our macrostate's pressure
and volume are defined once

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.770
we're at the new equilibrium,
so we're right here.

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.690
So my question in the
last video was,

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:06.780
how did we get here?

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.900
Is there any way to have defined
a path to get from our

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:13.970
first state-- where pressure and
volume were well defined,

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.520
because the system wasn't
thermodynamic equilibrium-- to

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.330
get to our second state?

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.400
And the answer was no.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.460
Because between this state
and this state

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:25.790
all hell broke loose.

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.960
I had different temperatures
at different

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.110
points in the system.

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.580
I could have had a different
pressure here

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.030
than I had up here.

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.770
The volume might have
been fluctuating

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:38.080
from moment to moment.

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.220
So when you're outside of
equilibrium-- and I had

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.310
written it down over there--
you cannot define, or you

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.160
can't say that those macro
variables are well defined.

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.710
So there was no path that you
could say how we got from--

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:57.510
erase this-- how we got from
state 1 to state 2.

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.470
You could just say, OK, we
were in some type of

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:00.380
equilibrium.

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:01.840
So we were in state 1.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.860
Then I blew away
half the rock.

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.430
The pressure went down,
the volume went up.

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.800
The temperature also
probably went down.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.100
And so I ended up in this other
state once I reached

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:12.440
equilibrium.

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.290
And that's all fair and good,
but wouldn't it have been nice

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:16.780
if there was some way?

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.400
If we could have said, look,
you know, there's some way

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.750
that we got from this
point to this point?

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.080
If we could perform my little
rock experiment in a slightly

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.850
different manner, so that all
this hell didn't break loose,

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:32.600
so that maybe at every point in
between my macro variables

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:33.940
are actually defined?

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:34.870
So how could I do that?

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.190
Remember, I said that the
macro variables, the

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.030
macrostates, whether it's
pressure, temperature, volume,

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.740
and there are others, but I said
these are only defined

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:46.090
when we are in a thermodynamic
equilibrium.

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.940
And that just means that
things have reached a

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:49.830
stability point.

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:52.510
That, for example, the
temperature is consistent

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:53.440
throughout the system.

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.690
If it's not consistent
throughout the system, I

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:56.720
shouldn't be talking about it.

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.840
If the temperature is different
here than it is up

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.750
here, I shouldn't say that
the temperature of

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:02.630
the system is x.

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:03.850
It's different at different
points.

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:06.010
I really can't make a
well-defined statement about

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:10.890
temperature, similar for
pressure or for volume,

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:12.650
because the volume is
also fluctuating.

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:15.830
But what if I perform that
same experiment?

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:18.279
That same process,
I should call it.

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:20.740
Let me draw it again.

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:23.660
So I have my canister.

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:27.250
And instead of starting with a
rock, just one big rock-- let

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:31.830
me draw, this is my piston right
here, at the top of the

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.850
movable ceiling of
the cylinder.

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:37.960
And I have some gas
inside of it.

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:42.290
Instead of having just one big
rock like I had over here, how

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:44.990
about I start with an equal
weight of rock?

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:48.660
But let's say I have a bunch of
small pebbles that add up

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:49.600
to that same rock.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:54.540
So just a bunch of, well, you
know, just a pile of pebbles.

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:55.435
You know, maybe they're sand.

00:04:55.435 --> 00:05:01.520
They're super duper small.

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:05.410
Instead of just blowing away
half of the sand all at once,

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:08.480
like I did with that rock over
there, and immediately jumping

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:11.230
to that state and throwing the
whole system into this

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:14.340
undefined state of
non-equilibrium.

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:16.950
Instead of doing that, let me
just do things very slowly and

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:17.670
very gently.

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:21.820
Let me just take out one grain
of sand at a time.

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:24.195
So if I just take out
one grain of sand.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.170
And so I took out an

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:30.110
infinitesimal amount of weight.

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:31.600
So what's going to happen?

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:33.700
Well this piston's going to
move up a little bit.

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:35.650
And let me draw that.

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:37.360
So let me copy and paste it.

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:45.090
So I just took out one
little piece of sand.

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:47.250
The force pushing down will
be a little bit less.

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:49.770
The pressure pushing down
will be a little less.

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:54.740
And so my piston-- let me see
if I can draw this-- it will

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:59.610
have moved up-- let me erase
it-- it will have moved up a

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:02.510
very infinitesimal--
infinitesimal means an

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:08.720
infinitely small amount-- it
would have moved an infinitely

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.120
small amount of time.

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.830
And so you wouldn't have thrown
that system into this,

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:15.480
you know, havoc that I
did this last time.

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:17.430
Of course, we haven't moved
all the way here yet.

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:19.880
But what we have done is, we
would have moved from that

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:24.030
point maybe to this other point
right here that's just a

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:26.780
little bit closer to there.

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:29.210
I've just removed a little
bit of the weight.

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:31.090
So my pressure went down
just a little bit.

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:32.930
And my volume went up
a just a little bit.

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:34.760
Temperature probably
went down.

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:37.910
And the key here is I'm trying
to do it in such small

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:43.630
increments that as I do it, my
system is pretty much super

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:46.190
close to equilibrium.

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:49.240
I'm just doing it just slow
enough that at every step it

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:51.470
achieves equilibrium
almost immediately.

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:54.720
Or it's almost in equilibrium
the whole time I'm doing it.

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:57.390
And then I do it again,
and do it again.

00:06:57.390 --> 00:07:00.530
And I'll just draw my drawings
a little less neat, just for

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:02.440
the sake of time.

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:06.620
Let's say I remove another
little dot of sand that's

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:09.380
infinitely small mass.

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:14.050
And now my little piston will
move just a little bit higher.

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:17.540
And I have, remember I have one
less sand up here than I

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:19.800
had over here.

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:23.030
And then my volume in my gas
increases a little bit.

00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:24.230
My pressure goes down
a little bit.

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:27.260
And I've moved to
this point here.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:30.260
What I'm doing here is I'm
setting up what's called a

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.120
quasi-static process.

00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:40.830
And the reason why it's
called that is

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:42.890
because it's almost static.

00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:45.790
It's almost in equilibrium
the whole time.

00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:48.280
Every time I move a grain of
sand I'm just moving a little

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:49.920
bit closer.

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:52.820
And obviously even a grain of
sand, the reality is if I were

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:55.220
to do this in real life, even
a grain of sand on a small

00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:56.530
scale is going to reek
a little bit

00:07:56.530 --> 00:07:58.040
of havoc on my system.

00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:00.820
This piston is going to
go up a little bit.

00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:03.525
So say, let me just do even a
smaller grain of sand, and do

00:08:03.525 --> 00:08:05.400
it even a little bit slower
so that I'm always in

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:06.270
equilibrium.

00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:08.440
So you can imagine this is kind
of a theoretical thing.

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:11.840
If I did an infinitely small
grains of sand, and did it

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:15.000
just slow enough so that it's
just gently moved from this

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.200
point to this point.

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:19.210
But we like to think of it
theoretically, because it

00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:21.390
allows us to describe a path.

00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:23.960
Because remember, why am I
being so careful here?

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:26.890
Why am I so careful to make
sure that the state, the

00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:29.790
system is in equilibrium the
whole time when I get from

00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:31.150
there to there?

00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:35.700
Because our macrostates, our
macro variables like pressure,

00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:38.049
volume, and temperature, our
only defined when we're in

00:08:38.049 --> 00:08:39.000
equilibrium.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.659
So if I do this process super
slowly, in super small

00:08:42.659 --> 00:08:46.200
increments, it allows me to keep
my pressure and volume

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:49.270
and actually my temperature
of macrostates at

00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:50.070
any point in time.

00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:51.930
So I could actually
plot a path.

00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:53.860
So if I keep doing it small,
small, small, I could actually

00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:59.280
plot a path to say, how did I
get from state 1 to state 2 on

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:01.960
this on this PV diagram.

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:05.270
And you might say, hey, you
know, Sal, this is all-- And

00:09:05.270 --> 00:09:06.580
I'll take a little
step back here.

00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:08.480
I always found this
really confusing.

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:13.210
You know, you'll see a lot of
talk in thermodynamic circles,

00:09:13.210 --> 00:09:15.920
or even in your book about--
it has to be a quasi-static

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:18.540
process, and I always used to
wonder, why are people going

00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:20.870
through these pains to describe
this process where

00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:22.340
you're removing sand
after sand?

00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:25.070
And the whole point is because
you want to get as close to

00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:27.960
equilibrium the whole time
you're doing it as possible so

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:31.780
that your pressure and volume
are defined the whole time.

00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:33.970
The reality is, in the real
world you can never get

00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:36.870
something that's continuously
defined, but you can just do

00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:39.095
really, really, really
small increments.

00:09:39.095 --> 00:09:41.950
So that at each small increment
you're at some

00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:42.490
equilibrium.

00:09:42.490 --> 00:09:44.460
And if you're not happy with
that, you can do even smaller

00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:44.870
increments.

00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:47.120
So at some point, at some
limiting point, you do have

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:51.970
some type of continuous state
change, while you're always in

00:09:51.970 --> 00:09:52.600
equilibrium.

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:55.040
It's almost an oxymoron, because
you're saying you're

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:59.690
static, you're saying that
you're in equilibrium the

00:09:59.690 --> 00:10:02.640
whole time, but clearly you're
also changing the whole time.

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:05.990
You keep removing little
pieces of sand.

00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:07.770
But you're moving them just
slowly enough that all that

00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:11.130
crazy up and down motion, and
all of the flux, and all of

00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:13.730
the weird temperature changes
don't happen.

00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:16.450
And it just, you know, just
that it slowly, slowly,

00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:18.950
slowly creeps up.

00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:21.180
The reason why I'm even going
through this exercise is

00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:24.250
because it's key when we start
talking about thermodynamics

00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:27.410
and these PV diagrams, and
we'll start talking about

00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:30.980
carnot engines and all of that,
that we be able to at

00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:34.250
least theoretically describe the
path that we take on this

00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:35.280
PV diagram.

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:37.670
And we wouldn't have been able
to do that if we can't assume

00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:41.210
that we're dealing with a
quasi-static process.

00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:45.230
Now there's another term that
you'll hear in thermodynamic

00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:48.240
circles that really, I mean, to
me it really, I don't know,

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:50.830
I had trouble comprehending it
the first time I heard it,

00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:52.080
called reversible.

00:10:54.430 --> 00:10:57.820
And sometimes these terms
quasi-static and reversible

00:10:57.820 --> 00:11:00.275
are used interchangeably, but
there is a difference.

00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:06.550
Reversible processes are
quasi-static, and most

00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:08.620
quasi-static processes are
reversible, but there are a

00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:10.150
few special cases that aren't.

00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:12.660
But the idea of a reversible
process is something that

00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:14.620
happens so slowly.

00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:17.420
So in this example I took off
a grain of sand and I got to

00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:20.950
the state, but if I assume that
no friction when, you

00:11:20.950 --> 00:11:23.470
know, when this piston moved up
a little bit, in the real

00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:27.130
world, let's say if this piston
was metal, when this

00:11:27.130 --> 00:11:29.660
rubs against the canister,
there'd be a little bit of

00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:32.170
friction generated and a little
bit of energy would be

00:11:32.170 --> 00:11:33.930
dissipated as friction
or heat.

00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:36.270
But in a reversible process,
we're assuming that, look,

00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:37.520
this is frictionless.

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:40.500
When anything happens in the
system, when we go from this

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:42.300
state right here-- let's
say this the state a,

00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:43.080
this is state b.

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:46.000
So this is state a,
this is state b.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.710
When we go from this state
to this state, one, we're

00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:51.760
infinitesimally close to
equilibrium the whole time, so

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:54.910
all of our macrostates
are well defined.

00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:57.670
And even more, when we move from
one state to the other,

00:11:57.670 --> 00:11:59.840
there's no loss or dissipation
of energy.

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:03.570
So those are two important
characteristics.

00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:06.850
One, infinitely close to
equilibrium at all times, and

00:12:06.850 --> 00:12:07.870
no loss of energy.

00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:10.540
And the reason why that matters
for a reversible

00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:13.120
process is because if we wanted,
if we were sitting in

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:18.790
state b, we could just add
another grain of sand back in,

00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:22.660
push down this piston infinitely
slowly, at an

00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:26.180
infinitely small increment,
and get back to state a.

00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:27.340
So that's why it's called
reversible.

00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:32.380
You could be at this point right
here, and take out a

00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:34.740
little bit of sand, and get
to this point right here.

00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:37.440
But if you want, since no energy
was lost, you could add

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:40.970
a little bit of sand, and get
back to this point right here.

00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:44.290
Now the reality in the real
world is, there is no such

00:12:44.290 --> 00:12:46.540
thing as a perfectly
reversible process.

00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:48.790
There will always be, whenever
you do anything, there will

00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:54.090
always be some energy or heat
lost to the process.

00:12:54.090 --> 00:12:58.400
In the real world, if I moved
down here, if I tried to put

00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:00.750
the sand back I would lose some
energy and probably get

00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:02.360
to a little slightly
different point.

00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:03.645
But you don't have to
worry about that.

00:13:03.645 --> 00:13:07.900
The important takeaway from
this video is that, in the

00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:11.400
situation I described there,
there was no intermediate

00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:14.480
macrostate variables, because
our system was in flux, it

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:16.000
wasn't in equilibrium.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.200
So if we wanted to get
intermediate states, we just

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:21.600
have to essentially do
this process slower.

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:24.060
And so slow, I mean, it
theoretically would take you

00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:26.090
forever, so we can only
approximate it.

00:13:26.090 --> 00:13:29.100
But the sand gives you an idea
of what we're talking about.

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:32.000
And if we did it slowly with
these infinitesimally small

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.700
particles of sand, then we can
define the state at every

00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:39.480
point along the process.

00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:41.490
And that's why we call it
quasi-static, because at any

00:13:41.490 --> 00:13:43.000
point it's almost static.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.480
It's almost in equilibrium.

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:48.730
So our pressures, volumes, and
temperatures can be defined.

00:13:48.730 --> 00:13:51.890
And if we add to that the notion
that we haven't lost

00:13:51.890 --> 00:13:55.510
any heat when we're going in one
direction or another, we

00:13:55.510 --> 00:13:57.420
could say it's reversible,
because if we took a piece of

00:13:57.420 --> 00:14:02.050
sand away, we can always add
a little bit of sand next.

00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:04.280
Now, actually, with that said,
let me give you the one

00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:07.440
example of maybe a
quasi-static-- no, actually

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:08.910
I'll save that for
future video.

00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:11.370
Anyway, hopefully you understand
that these are two

00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:14.560
concepts that used to really
confuse me, and hopefully this

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:15.670
clears it up a little bit.

00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:18.180
And I think more than what it
is, I think the first time I

00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:20.210
read about them I'm like, OK,
well what's the big deal?

00:14:20.210 --> 00:14:25.130
The big deal is, it allows you
to define your macrostates for

00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:27.770
every state in between
these two states

00:14:27.770 --> 00:14:28.540
that you care about.

00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:30.880
When you just did it as
a regular kind of

00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:34.040
non-quasi-static process,
in between you

00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:35.980
don't know what happened.
