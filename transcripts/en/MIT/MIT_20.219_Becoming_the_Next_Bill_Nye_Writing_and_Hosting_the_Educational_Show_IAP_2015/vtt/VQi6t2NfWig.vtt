00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:24.350
ELIZABETH CHOE: So today
is the first screening

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:26.270
of your rough cuts.

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:30.610
And the way this will work is
I will show one of the videos,

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:31.780
and we'll all watch it.

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:35.300
You guys can take notes
on it while you watch.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.220
And after each
screening we will give

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:41.440
general high-level
feedback to the creator.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.829
And that's what-- we'll just
go through the whole class

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.120
and do that for the first half.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.220
Now for the second half,
there are a couple options

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:49.510
that we could proceed.

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:51.950
The first being
what I usually do

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:57.090
with Science Out Loud, which
is to basically do Google

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.187
Docs for detailed comments.

00:00:59.187 --> 00:01:00.770
And this is really
useful because it's

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:02.860
sort of like a check
box when you're

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.530
going back through and looking
at feedback from another person

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:06.670
when you edit.

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.030
So this was for
George's farts video.

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.850
And I made some
notes about where

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.170
we should add some animations,
where we should add overlays.

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:18.810
So this is one option
that we could do.

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.600
Basically break you guys
up to where you will end up

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.320
commenting on at least
two people's videos,

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.490
and we would know who
you would be assigned to.

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.250
The other option is
that we could just

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.290
go ahead and pair you guys
up or group you guys up,

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.370
and instead of doing the
Google Docs feedback,

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:36.930
you can just talk to
each other one on one.

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.184
Do you people have
preferences on how we do this?

00:01:41.184 --> 00:01:42.100
AUDIENCE: Google Docs.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.266
ELIZABETH CHOE: Google Docs.

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.451
Anyone else?

00:01:48.451 --> 00:01:48.950
All right.

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.560
So we'll do Google Docs.

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.940
And I will give you
the details on how

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.580
that's going to happen during
the second half of class.

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.210
Sounds good?

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.810
So, as it was for
the table reads--

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.860
remember that repetitive
comments are OK.

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.759
It's OK if you feel the
same sort of feedback

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.710
that another person
has already said

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:12.980
because it'll draw
attention to the creator

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.640
and what they need to work on.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.240
Also remember that at the end
of the day this is your video,

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:22.690
so the feedback is for you to
take or leave-- hey, Nathan.

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.180
And this is probably going
to be the most valuable class

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.090
time the whole month because
this is where you're really

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.320
going to have concrete advice
on implementing the stuff

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.230
that we've talked about so far.

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.010
So really take this
as an opportunity

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.610
to give as constructive
and meaningful feedback as

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.050
possible.

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:42.087
All right?

00:02:42.087 --> 00:02:43.670
Does anyone have
questions or comments

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:44.720
before we start watching?

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:47.420
No?

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.441
Are you excited?

00:02:49.441 --> 00:02:49.940
OK.

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:51.024
AUDIENCE: We need popcorn.

00:02:51.024 --> 00:02:53.314
ELIZABETH CHOE: I thought
about making pop-- but then I

00:02:53.314 --> 00:02:55.840
thought that if people were
taking notes on their computers

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.997
and they had, like,
butter on their fingers.

00:02:58.997 --> 00:03:00.330
We'll pop for another screening.

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:01.310
AUDIENCE: --later for a snack.

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.605
ELIZABETH CHOE: Yeah.

00:03:01.605 --> 00:03:01.900
AUDIENCE: That's fine.

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.191
Maybe we should close the big--

00:03:03.191 --> 00:03:06.112
ELIZABETH CHOE: Yeah,
I'll close the door.

00:03:06.112 --> 00:03:07.320
Does anyone want to go first?

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:10.700
No?

00:03:16.035 --> 00:03:19.480
Does that show up on screen
OK if I turn these lights off?

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.470
OK.

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:24.430
OK, well, then we will
just go down the line.

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.480
How about that?

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.355
So lucky you, Nathan.

00:03:28.355 --> 00:03:30.230
Do you want to say
anything before we screen,

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.313
or do you want to just go
ahead and watch and then

00:03:32.313 --> 00:03:33.815
talk about your process?

00:03:33.815 --> 00:03:35.190
AUDIENCE: I'm
going to be honest,

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.280
and I made a pretty
bad mistake in putting

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.928
off filming until yesterday.

00:03:40.928 --> 00:03:45.035
And so I only got to get in
the editing this morning.

00:03:45.035 --> 00:03:47.410
And it really shows.

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:49.530
ELIZABETH CHOE: Well,
let's see what you have.

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.580
And there is time, that's
what tomorrow's for.

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:55.210
AUDIENCE: I couldn't get
the animations to work.

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:56.860
ELIZABETH CHOE: OK.

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:00.300
And do keep in mind that
all day tomorrow and all day

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:04.370
Thursday is open for you
to incorporate feedback.

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:06.550
After today's class
ends, we're not

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:09.770
meeting again until the
screening on Thursday at 6:30.

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:12.127
So as long as we get
videos in by, like-- 6:00

00:04:12.127 --> 00:04:13.670
PM's the latest.

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:16.029
Hopefully you're not
working up until 6:00 PM.

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:17.570
You have the rest
of the day to work.

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:19.805
PROFESSOR: But if you need
our help, then e-mail us.

00:04:19.805 --> 00:04:21.149
And we can meet up if you want.

00:04:21.149 --> 00:04:21.982
ELIZABETH CHOE: Yes.

00:04:21.982 --> 00:04:25.015
We will be in the classroom
tomorrow and Thursday

00:04:25.015 --> 00:04:25.848
if people need help.

00:04:29.434 --> 00:04:30.100
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.202
-Why does your-- why does
your fridge start to smell?

00:04:33.202 --> 00:04:34.407
[END PLAYBACK]

00:04:34.407 --> 00:04:35.990
ELIZABETH CHOE: The
sound sounds good.

00:04:40.354 --> 00:04:41.020
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.110
-Why does your fridge
start to smell?

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:45.610
And where does that icky
black liquid come from?

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:48.710
Wouldn't life just be
easier if things didn't rot,

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:50.560
if things lasted forever?

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.260
Well, maybe, but probably not.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.670
According to the USDA, the
average American household

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:56.340
wastes 25% of its food.

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.650
And a lot of restaurants
are even worse.

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:00.630
So if we didn't
have decomposition,

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:02.700
what would happen to
the food we throw away?

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:05.560
Food in landfills normally gets
dealt with by bacteria, fungi,

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:07.460
and protists that allow
the nutrients in food

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:09.990
to return to the soil and,
eventually, other living

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:11.140
things.

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:13.960
These decomposers also
break down other dead stuff,

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:15.100
like trees.

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:19.060
In fact, they're pretty much the
only thing that can eat wood.

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:22.087
So in a world without rot,
while your home may not

00:05:22.087 --> 00:05:23.920
have to worry about
being eaten by termites,

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:25.536
who rely on protists
in their stomach,

00:05:25.536 --> 00:05:26.910
pretty soon forests
and landfills

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:29.495
would be flooded with
a lot of dead stuff.

00:05:29.495 --> 00:05:31.740
So how do we avoid this problem?

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:35.410
Well, basically, in your
fridge, on a forest floor,

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:37.960
in a dumpster, almost
anywhere, there

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.620
are fungi, bacteria, and
protists that live entirely

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:41.506
by eating dead stuff.

00:05:41.506 --> 00:05:43.380
These dead things can
be more or less divided

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:44.820
into three categories.

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:47.060
Carbohydrates--
sugar and starches.

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:48.530
Lipids-- think fats.

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:50.077
And proteins, like meats.

00:05:50.077 --> 00:05:51.660
All of these are
chemically different,

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:53.960
so they each get broken
down by different enzymes

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:57.160
in different ways before
being absorbed by decomposers.

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:00.160
For example, proteases
break down proteins

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.710
into amino acids, the
cells building blocks.

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:04.660
Lipids rely on lipases.

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:08.870
And carbohydrates on things
like amylase and cellulases.

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:11.010
So how does a perfectly
nice broccoli floret

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:13.490
start giving off this
foul black liquid?

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:15.849
Fruits and vegetables are
almost entirely made of water.

00:06:15.849 --> 00:06:17.390
So on the most basic
level, you could

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:20.470
say their cells are like
extremely complex water

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:21.270
balloons.

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:23.220
The exterior-- a
cell wall-- is made

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:25.230
of cellulose, a complex
carbohydrate that

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:28.290
gets broken down by enzymes
into small sugars the cell can

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:29.580
get energy from.

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:32.080
When bacteria or fungi
uses cellulase to eat

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:33.770
the exterior of
a cell, it's like

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:35.890
if I were to pop the balloon.

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:38.230
That's the muck you
see in your fridge.

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:40.150
And that's how you get
that icky black liquid.

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:43.256
What about that stink?

00:06:43.256 --> 00:06:44.880
For fruits and
vegetables a lot of time

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:48.180
the smell happens after the
icky black liquid forms.

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:49.900
Other bacteria that
weren't involved

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:52.430
in the initial
colonization move in

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:54.410
and start to stink
everything up.

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:56.700
Meat gets smelly when
lipases break down

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:59.500
fat in the meat into
glycerol and fatty acids--

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:00.930
two energy sources.

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:03.610
And fatty acids
are kind of gross.

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:07.620
And so while your food rotting
may smell absolutely terrible,

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:09.850
because of it the
environment's able to recycle

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:11.680
crucial nutrients it needs.

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:14.270
And, well, that's
why we have all this.

00:07:20.231 --> 00:07:21.807
That was awesome.

00:07:21.807 --> 00:07:22.890
ELIZABETH CHOE: All right.

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:23.870

to hear what you think

00:07:25.846 --> 00:07:27.514
before we give you feedback.

00:07:27.514 --> 00:07:29.180
ELIZABETH CHOE: Like
what are the things

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:30.594
that you like
about what you did,

00:07:30.594 --> 00:07:32.260
and what are the
things that you already

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:36.050
know you want to change or add?

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:37.259
AUDIENCE: The audio.

00:07:37.259 --> 00:07:37.758
ELIZABETH CHOE: The audio.

00:07:37.758 --> 00:07:39.091
AUDIENCE: The lack of animation.

00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:43.740
The main things.

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:45.240
ELIZABETH CHOE:
What was the hardest

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:49.220
part about making this video?

00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:53.390
AUDIENCE: Actually going
and doing the shooting.

00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:56.079
I kind of put that off as
long as I really feasibly

00:07:56.079 --> 00:08:00.795
could have because I really
didn't want to do it.

00:08:00.795 --> 00:08:02.170
ELIZABETH CHOE:
Was it as painful

00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:04.120
as you thought it would
be once you started?

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:04.577
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:08:04.577 --> 00:08:05.452
ELIZABETH CHOE: Yeah.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.110
Well, I will say that
the script is very, very

00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:12.850
tight in this video.

00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:15.000
And it has come a
very long way from

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.150
your initial brainstorming.

00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:18.930
And if you come
to the screening,

00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:21.690
you'll get to actually
see all the pictures.

00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:25.180
So, just a plug to come to
the screening if you want to.

00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:27.190
But the script is super tight.

00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:29.660
And I know that you spent
a long time honing that,

00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:33.840
and I think that
really paid off.

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:38.150
It's two thirty-three,
which is a great time.

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:41.329
So I think that as far
as the content goes

00:08:41.329 --> 00:08:43.370
it's really strong, and
I can tell that you spent

00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:44.750
a lot of time developing that.

00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:49.490
Does anyone want to
add some more feedback?

00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:52.082
I mean, I can talk
to-- yes, Yuliya.

00:08:52.082 --> 00:08:54.432
AUDIENCE: I like
the transitions.

00:08:54.432 --> 00:08:56.015
There weren't too
many of them, but it

00:08:56.015 --> 00:08:58.540
was nice to see a change
of background and scene.

00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:00.240
ELIZABETH CHOE: Yeah.

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:01.290
And clean cuts.

00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:03.370
No funky swirls, no fades.

00:09:03.370 --> 00:09:03.870
It's nice.

00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:04.995
AUDIENCE: Yeah, definitely.

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:08.720
I was going to say something
else, but I forgot.

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:09.803
ELIZABETH CHOE: That's OK.

00:09:09.803 --> 00:09:12.980
We can come back
if you remember.

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:13.480
Anyone else?

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:15.030
Yes, Andrea.

00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:17.630
Sorry.

00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:19.950
AUDIENCE: I really
like the pacing of it.

00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:22.830
It's a little rushed
in a couple of places,

00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:24.750
but that's-- that happens.

00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:26.670
But I like the
pacing in general.

00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:30.990
And I also like the
water balloon example

00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:36.822
and the different
camera angles, and I

00:09:36.822 --> 00:09:40.581
thought it was just really
artistically very well done,

00:09:40.581 --> 00:09:43.350
very well composed.

00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:46.690
ELIZABETH CHOE: What was
so terrible about actually

00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:47.190
shooting?

00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:50.525
Was it being on camera?

00:09:50.525 --> 00:09:51.150
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:52.025
ELIZABETH CHOE: Yeah.

00:09:52.025 --> 00:09:56.190
AUDIENCE: And also, each
one took a lot of takes.

00:09:56.190 --> 00:09:57.710
ELIZABETH CHOE: Yeah.

00:09:57.710 --> 00:09:59.700
I will say-- because I
know that a lot of you

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:02.290
expressed sort of
concern and hesitation

00:10:02.290 --> 00:10:04.882
about being on camera, and I
feel like a lot of this class

00:10:04.882 --> 00:10:07.720
has been like actually no,
you're really great on camera.

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:10.660
The opening shot is delivered
really, really well.

00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:13.176
And there are spots
where, like Andrea said,

00:10:13.176 --> 00:10:14.800
you're rushing your
words a little bit.

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:17.130
And I'm sure you'll see it
when you go back through.

00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:20.350
And whenever you guys do
your Google Doc comments,

00:10:20.350 --> 00:10:24.570
point out spaces where
maybe his delivery changes.

00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:26.520
It is a little inconsistent
between scenes,

00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:28.040
but there are some
scenes where it

00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:30.750
is delivered so
perfectly and so clearly,

00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:35.210
and you seem really, really
comfortable on screen.

00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:35.850
Yeah.

00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:40.090
AUDIENCE: I will say-- did
you shoot it by yourself?

00:10:40.090 --> 00:10:44.640
AUDIENCE: I did shoot it mostly
by myself, since I put it off.

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:47.420
AUDIENCE: Because I found that
it was a lot easier to have

00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:52.411
someone shoot it than,
like, when we were doing

00:10:52.411 --> 00:10:54.412
those first blogs and
stuff at the beginning,

00:10:54.412 --> 00:10:56.590
I thought that was a lot
harder doing it by myself

00:10:56.590 --> 00:10:58.080
than having someone there.

00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:02.310
I felt less comfortable being
alone than with someone.

00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:03.809
Which is kind of--
I thought it'd

00:11:03.809 --> 00:11:06.184
be the other way around when
I first started the project.

00:11:09.118 --> 00:11:11.563
Other than that, like,
how I think he used--

00:11:11.563 --> 00:11:12.541
went to Star Market.

00:11:12.541 --> 00:11:15.876
So representing a
local grocer too.

00:11:15.876 --> 00:11:16.750
AUDIENCE: Yeah, yeah.

00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:17.600
I agree.

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:20.208
I like the part where he
talked about the smell.

00:11:20.208 --> 00:11:20.708
You know?

00:11:20.708 --> 00:11:21.134
ELIZABETH CHOE: Yeah.

00:11:21.134 --> 00:11:23.304
AUDIENCE: And I like
the cut on the fridge.

00:11:23.304 --> 00:11:24.627
AUDIENCE: The visual, yeah.

00:11:24.627 --> 00:11:26.210
ELIZABETH CHOE: What
do you guys think

00:11:26.210 --> 00:11:27.450
about the visuals in general?

00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:30.390
Because it's always hard to
do a chemistry or biology

00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:33.340
video because the
visualizations are always

00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:35.210
somewhat impossible to do.

00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:36.625
Yeah, Yuliya.

00:11:36.625 --> 00:11:39.810
AUDIENCE: I think it
would be nice to show some

00:11:39.810 --> 00:11:42.760
of the scientific vocabulary,
so we can see it and not

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:43.320
just hear it.

00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:45.330
ELIZABETH CHOE: Yeah, like
a label on top or something.

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:47.110
AUDIENCE: And then
for the backgrounds,

00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:49.450
like, the plants backgrounds
worked really well

00:11:49.450 --> 00:11:51.030
and, like, the
fridge and all that.

00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:52.738
But there was a part
where there was just

00:11:52.738 --> 00:11:58.250
a random penguin or random
pictures on the wall that

00:11:58.250 --> 00:12:03.340
maybe could be overlaid
with animation.

00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:06.300
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:14.860
[END PLAYBACK]

00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:17.387
ELIZABETH CHOE: Like this shot.

00:12:17.387 --> 00:12:18.970
I like that you have
the kitchen space

00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:20.110
as sort of your home base.

00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:22.322
Because your centered on
the question of why things

00:12:22.322 --> 00:12:23.780
rot in your fridge,
and that's what

00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:25.530
allows you to
explore decomposition

00:12:25.530 --> 00:12:27.790
at greater length.

00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:33.060
But this is doing that whole
thing that a lot of web videos

00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:34.847
do, where you
center the subject.

00:12:34.847 --> 00:12:36.430
And I was talking
to Chris [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:38.940
about why it's so common
that SciShow does it

00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:40.100
and Vsauce does it.

00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:47.060
And it sort of gives off an
air of it being not as formal.

00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:50.010
But it's also a little
bit comical, too.

00:12:50.010 --> 00:12:51.510
And I think that
if you just-- even

00:12:51.510 --> 00:12:53.259
if you zoomed in just
a little bit and got

00:12:53.259 --> 00:12:55.980
rid of, like, this
spray thing on the side

00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:58.920
and the cooking
things on that side,

00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:00.470
it might help with this one.

00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:05.920
Also remember to tuck your mic
in under your shirt if you can.

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:06.420
Let's see.

00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:09.100
But you were talking about
this penguin here, right?

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:11.090
Yeah, so this--
I mean, you could

00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:13.520
play around with keeping
this footage, if you like,

00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:14.780
and just zoom in a little bit.

00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:18.110
See if you can digitally zoom
in on the editing software.

00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:20.580
If the resolution
kind of goes kaput,

00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:22.160
you may have to
re-film that part.

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:26.530
But again, I think
Yuliya is right in that

00:13:26.530 --> 00:13:29.040
be careful about having
visual distractors

00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:31.930
when you don't really
need them there.

00:13:31.930 --> 00:13:34.450
I do agree with-- was it Andrea?

00:13:34.450 --> 00:13:37.671
Who said something
about the pacing?

00:13:37.671 --> 00:13:39.920
Yeah, I think the pacing of
your cuts are pretty good.

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:44.400
Like, nothing lasts a little
too long, nothing's too short.

00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:47.020
If you have B-roll,
it might give you

00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:49.640
a little bit of breathing
room in between shots

00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:52.265
where you're talking really fast
and you have a lot of content.

00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:59.330
But yeah, like
stuff like this-- I

00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:00.456
don't remember what
you're talking about here.

00:14:00.456 --> 00:14:00.880
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:03.255
- --while your home may not have
to worry about being eaten by--

00:14:03.255 --> 00:14:03.530
[END PLAYBACK]

00:14:03.530 --> 00:14:04.792
ELIZABETH CHOE: Yeah, so--

00:14:04.792 --> 00:14:06.167
AUDIENCE: Comical
note on that, I

00:14:06.167 --> 00:14:08.530
filmed in front of
someone's house,

00:14:08.530 --> 00:14:10.732
and they actually came
out and asked me to stop.

00:14:10.732 --> 00:14:11.531
And so I kind of--

00:14:11.531 --> 00:14:11.982
ELIZABETH CHOE: Oh, no.

00:14:11.982 --> 00:14:14.050
AUDIENCE: --gave up on
actually filming at home.

00:14:14.050 --> 00:14:17.360
ELIZABETH CHOE: Filming
in front of a house.

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:18.835
I mean, is this
in your dorm room?

00:14:18.835 --> 00:14:19.460
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:19.860
ELIZABETH CHOE: OK.

00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:22.380
AUDIENCE: That's what my backup
idea was, since it's my home.

00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:24.838
ELIZABETH CHOE: Yeah, actually,
I think that it works fine.

00:14:24.838 --> 00:14:29.100
And I would say for this one,
do a wider shot for this one

00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:31.980
because it doesn't
quite establish

00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:33.460
that you're in your own place.

00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:35.700
Like, if you can see you
sitting on your actual bed,

00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:38.860
that might help a
little bit more.

00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:41.230
So again, it's not a matter
of using wide or close-up

00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:45.340
shots for the sake of using
them on principle, but like what

00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:48.987
the background actually reveals
and sets for the audience.

00:14:48.987 --> 00:14:51.320
AUDIENCE: I was wondering,
can you go back a little bit?

00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:52.778
Because there was--
I was wondering

00:14:52.778 --> 00:14:56.804
what your vision was for this.

00:14:56.804 --> 00:14:57.720
AUDIENCE: Right there.

00:14:57.720 --> 00:14:59.760
Yes.

00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:02.165
I'm still missing stock footage.

00:15:02.165 --> 00:15:02.706
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:15:02.706 --> 00:15:04.747
ELIZABETH CHOE: Oh, so
this is like a placeholder

00:15:04.747 --> 00:15:05.526
for the rough cut.

00:15:05.526 --> 00:15:06.975
I figured that was the case.

00:15:06.975 --> 00:15:07.578
AUDIENCE: --what you
were planning to do here.

00:15:07.578 --> 00:15:10.339
I was like, I'm not sure
what I'm looking at.

00:15:10.339 --> 00:15:10.839
OK.

00:15:10.839 --> 00:15:11.714
ELIZABETH CHOE: Yeah.

00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:16.245
Oh, the dumpster shot.

00:15:16.245 --> 00:15:18.789
Yeah, I wanted to say
something about this, too.

00:15:18.789 --> 00:15:20.830
If this is something that
you decide to re-shoot,

00:15:20.830 --> 00:15:24.000
I would also maybe scoot
back a little bit as well.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.920
Because it's hard to tell
that it's really a dumpster

00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:28.330
until you actually say it.

00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:29.582
Where was this?

00:15:29.582 --> 00:15:31.290
AUDIENCE: It's down
at the loading docks.

00:15:31.290 --> 00:15:32.230
ELIZABETH CHOE: Oh, OK.

00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:34.355
AUDIENCE: I had a lot of
trouble with the dumpsters

00:15:34.355 --> 00:15:36.730
I'd planned on going to.

00:15:36.730 --> 00:15:39.970
By Walker is a bit
of a wind tunnel.

00:15:39.970 --> 00:15:46.627
And the Stata Center, out
behind W20 was really noisy.

00:15:46.627 --> 00:15:47.960
ELIZABETH CHOE: Which one's W20?

00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:49.168
AUDIENCE: The student center.

00:15:49.168 --> 00:15:50.310
ELIZABETH CHOE: Oh, OK.

00:15:50.310 --> 00:15:52.460
I mean, there is
an optimal dumps--

00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:55.050
if you guys are ever in
need of an optimal dumpster

00:15:55.050 --> 00:15:56.470
to fill up, let me tell you.

00:15:56.470 --> 00:15:59.910
Right behind the MIT
Museum-- by D-Lab actually--

00:15:59.910 --> 00:16:05.130
there are some prime
dumpster spots for shooting.

00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:07.730
And that's where we shot
George's farts one, too.

00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:09.317
So if you need to.

00:16:09.317 --> 00:16:11.150
But in this one, I mean,
I think it's really

00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:13.050
matter of the camera angle.

00:16:13.050 --> 00:16:15.385
Did you shoot this on a tripod?

00:16:15.385 --> 00:16:16.010
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:16:16.010 --> 00:16:16.830
ELIZABETH CHOE: OK.

00:16:16.830 --> 00:16:19.987
Were you limited by how far you
could let your mic cable go?

00:16:19.987 --> 00:16:20.612
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:16:20.612 --> 00:16:23.305
ELIZABETH CHOE: OK.

00:16:23.305 --> 00:16:26.500
Yeah, maybe think about this one
as a potential one to re-shoot.

00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:31.670
Because I think the visual
background makes a lot of sense

00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:35.040
and is a really
good transition--

00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:37.400
it's a really good change
from the kitchen setting.

00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:40.852
So I would really love to see
that it's actually a dumpster.

00:16:40.852 --> 00:16:42.390
AUDIENCE: And if
you are refilming--

00:16:42.390 --> 00:16:44.970
only if you are refilming--
something that I noticed

00:16:44.970 --> 00:16:48.060
is that when you're talking
you bounce a little.

00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:49.905
So just-- like in
some of the film

00:16:49.905 --> 00:16:51.350
when your up close we see that.

00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:52.755
And it's just maybe
something that if you

00:16:52.755 --> 00:16:54.575
can be aware of that
while you're filming.

00:16:54.575 --> 00:16:57.550
It was just one moment, I can't
remember exactly where it was.

00:16:57.550 --> 00:16:58.960
Where is it?

00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:01.780
When you were talking, a
little towards the end.

00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:06.500
And I noticed it a little
more, this sort of gentle

00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:08.759
bounce while you talk.

00:17:08.759 --> 00:17:10.050
That you don't do all the time.

00:17:10.050 --> 00:17:12.900
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:17:26.187 --> 00:17:26.770
[END PLAYBACK]

00:17:26.770 --> 00:17:27.995
ELIZABETH CHOE: Maybe
we can find the--

00:17:27.995 --> 00:17:29.360
AUDIENCE: I'll look at it
more carefully, because there

00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:30.270
was a point where I was like--

00:17:30.270 --> 00:17:32.192
AUDIENCE: I think it was
the end of [INAUDIBLE].

00:17:32.192 --> 00:17:33.530
AUDIENCE: Do you know
what I'm talking about?

00:17:33.530 --> 00:17:34.314
OK.

00:17:34.314 --> 00:17:36.730
ELIZABETH CHOE: Maybe we can
note that in the Google Docs,

00:17:36.730 --> 00:17:39.210
whoever's commenting
on Nathan's.

00:17:39.210 --> 00:17:41.700
And again, stuff like this,
I think it's great, but maybe

00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:44.590
just like crop this
framing a little bit more

00:17:44.590 --> 00:17:47.940
so it's a little
more rule of thirds.

00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:50.620
Because the rule of thirds
works really well for this shot.

00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:53.680
And [INAUDIBLE] pointed
out a really good tip.

00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:55.650
When you do rule of
thirds, use the eyes

00:17:55.650 --> 00:17:58.860
as sort of the point
instead of, like, your face.

00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:00.670
Because there's just
a little too much room

00:18:00.670 --> 00:18:02.628
on the top and right-hand
side of this framing.

00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:08.640
How did you film the opening?

00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:09.930
Like, were you by yourself?

00:18:09.930 --> 00:18:11.555
Was it the first
thing that you filmed?

00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:24.030
AUDIENCE: I was by myself, and
that was the-- no, it wasn't.

00:18:24.030 --> 00:18:29.270
It was like second place I went.

00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:30.530
ELIZABETH CHOE: OK.

00:18:30.530 --> 00:18:32.220
Because whatever
conditions you were

00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:34.280
filming under for
this scene, I think

00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:36.590
you should really
try to remember

00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:37.774
what it was that you did.

00:18:37.774 --> 00:18:38.690
Because this opening--

00:18:38.690 --> 00:18:38.910
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:18:38.910 --> 00:18:39.830
- --start to smell?

00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:42.230
And where does that icky
black liquid come from?

00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:45.037
Wouldn't life just be
easier if things didn't rot?

00:18:45.037 --> 00:18:45.620
[END PLAYBACK]

00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:46.290
ELIZABETH CHOE:
Like that question

00:18:46.290 --> 00:18:48.160
is posed actually
quite naturally.

00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:50.743
I think the tendency for a lot
of people when they're starting

00:18:50.743 --> 00:18:53.870
would be to sort of overly
cheese that question up.

00:18:53.870 --> 00:18:56.370
And that's sort of what
happened in early readings

00:18:56.370 --> 00:18:58.650
that a lot of you guys did.

00:18:58.650 --> 00:19:00.450
But this one just
sounds very natural,

00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:04.030
like how you would actually
pose that question in real life.

00:19:04.030 --> 00:19:07.390
So whatever conditions that you
were under filming this one,

00:19:07.390 --> 00:19:11.240
really try to apply that
to whatever you re-shoot.

00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:14.290
Were you there with him
for this one by chance?

00:19:14.290 --> 00:19:15.230
Hmm.

00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:16.950
Maybe it's an
energy level thing.

00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:17.798
Like--

00:19:17.798 --> 00:19:19.430
AUDIENCE: I think
it was I was inside.

00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:20.850
ELIZABETH CHOE: You were
inside, so you weren't as

00:19:20.850 --> 00:19:22.100
nervous about filming outside.

00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:25.682
Yeah, actually, that does a
lot to people's deliveries.

00:19:25.682 --> 00:19:27.390
But yeah, just something
to keep in mind.

00:19:27.390 --> 00:19:29.098
Does anyone have final
thoughts before we

00:19:29.098 --> 00:19:30.340
move on to the next video?

00:19:35.250 --> 00:19:38.400
Do you know who we had paired
up to comment on Nathan's?

00:19:47.116 --> 00:19:49.489
PROFESSOR: Andrea and Kenneth.

00:19:49.489 --> 00:19:50.280
ELIZABETH CHOE: OK.

00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:52.830
So basically, for
the rough cut thing,

00:19:52.830 --> 00:19:55.900
we will pair you
up with two people.

00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:58.840
One of those people is
going to be the person who

00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:01.370
helped film your video,
and the other person

00:20:01.370 --> 00:20:03.620
is just someone completely new.

00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:06.431
So Kenneth and Andrea are
commenting on Nathan's.

00:20:08.986 --> 00:20:11.360
Andrea, do you want to say
anything about yours before we

00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:14.225
screen?

00:20:14.225 --> 00:20:17.704
AUDIENCE: There are lots
of placeholders for stuff,

00:20:17.704 --> 00:20:18.698
like similar.

00:20:24.165 --> 00:20:25.159
It's really boring.

00:20:28.141 --> 00:20:31.550
ELIZABETH CHOE: We will
be the judge of that.

00:20:31.550 --> 00:20:32.050
All right.

00:20:32.050 --> 00:20:33.372
This is Andrea's.

00:20:33.372 --> 00:20:34.710
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:38.680
-Eating is one of the great
pleasures and necessities

00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:39.940
of life.

00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:45.180
And to enjoy everything
from energy bars to apples,

00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:47.180
we rely on one
part of our bodies

00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:49.640
to do an important
job-- our teeth.

00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:57.260
Teeth are the hardest
substances in our bodies.

00:20:57.260 --> 00:20:59.650
They're harder than
our bones, and they're

00:20:59.650 --> 00:21:02.550
even harder than iron or steel.

00:21:02.550 --> 00:21:04.800
While we chew our
teeth experience

00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:09.020
forces of up to 225 pounds.

00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:10.650
Hmm.

00:21:10.650 --> 00:21:13.610
So why doesn't our
jaw just crumble

00:21:13.610 --> 00:21:16.430
under all of those forces?

00:21:16.430 --> 00:21:18.750
Between your tooth
and your jawbone,

00:21:18.750 --> 00:21:20.570
there is a specialized
piece of tissue

00:21:20.570 --> 00:21:25.820
called the periodontal
ligament, or PDL for short.

00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:28.530
The PDL can easily
absorb the normal forces

00:21:28.530 --> 00:21:32.980
that a tooth experiences when we
chew, say, an apple, cushioning

00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:36.760
or protecting our
jawbone from our teeth.

00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:40.290
And inside the PDL there
are all kinds of cells.

00:21:40.290 --> 00:21:42.830
One type, called
mechanoreceptors,

00:21:42.830 --> 00:21:45.760
sense forces of movement or
pressure applied to the tooth.

00:21:48.850 --> 00:21:53.140
Teeth sound like they're
already perfectly designed.

00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:56.070
But sometimes we really
need to force them

00:21:56.070 --> 00:21:58.432
in a certain direction.

00:21:58.432 --> 00:21:59.140
Like with braces.

00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:17.710
As the braces slowly
force the teeth to move,

00:22:17.710 --> 00:22:21.070
the PDL gets squeezed
in one direction

00:22:21.070 --> 00:22:25.350
and stretched in the other,
kind of like a rubber band.

00:22:25.350 --> 00:22:27.180
Here's where it
gets interesting.

00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:29.460
To make room, the
mechanoreceptors

00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:33.570
in the PDL trigger
cells called osteoclasts

00:22:33.570 --> 00:22:36.020
that actually come
in and dissolve part

00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:38.690
of your jaw to make extra room.

00:22:38.690 --> 00:22:41.650
The mechanoreceptors also
trigger another kind of cell,

00:22:41.650 --> 00:22:43.980
called an osteoblast,
which comes in

00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:46.800
and builds up part
of the jawbone.

00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:50.270
This allows the PDL to get back
into its regular cushioning

00:22:50.270 --> 00:22:54.820
shape, thus holding the
tooth securely in position.

00:22:54.820 --> 00:22:59.220
So if braces use osteoblasts
to physically reposition teeth

00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:01.120
for cosmetic reasons,
what if we want

00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:04.680
to use them to replace
things in our bodies?

00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:06.910
Dental implants
replace teeth that

00:23:06.910 --> 00:23:10.820
are damaged or missing to
restore chewing function.

00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:13.460
And MIT engineers are
using the properties

00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:17.110
of osteoblasts and osteoclasts
that are already in our bodies

00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:20.180
to create a chemical
coding for these implants.

00:23:20.180 --> 00:23:22.310
Just like in a
mouth with braces,

00:23:22.310 --> 00:23:24.860
this coding helps
create natural bone

00:23:24.860 --> 00:23:27.870
to help lock the
implant into place.

00:23:27.870 --> 00:23:29.780
Your jaw isn't the
only place where

00:23:29.780 --> 00:23:31.800
these osteoblasts
and osteoclasts are

00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:33.640
altering your bone structure.

00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:36.530
In fact, this bony
remodeling process

00:23:36.530 --> 00:23:39.040
is happening throughout
your entire body.

00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:42.200
And these implants aren't
just limited to teeth.

00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:49.240
Doctors can replace knees,
hips, and even spinal disks.

00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:51.430
Right now, these
implants are designed

00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:54.040
to have the exact same
functionality as the parts

00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:55.510
that they're replacing.

00:23:55.510 --> 00:23:58.190
But in the future,
scientists may even

00:23:58.190 --> 00:24:01.260
use implants to
improve our brains.

00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:04.960
Just like with braces, we
could modify our bodies

00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:08.710
to be more perfect.

00:24:08.710 --> 00:24:12.260
Once we've tasted the
forbidden fruit of perfection,

00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:13.240
will we still be human?

00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:22.886
[END PLAYBACK]

00:24:24.197 --> 00:24:25.280
ELIZABETH CHOE: All right.

00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:28.479
So, Andrea, why do you
think your video is boring?

00:24:28.479 --> 00:24:30.354
AUDIENCE: It's really
dense with information.

00:24:36.198 --> 00:24:39.120
It also doesn't have
very good settings in it,

00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:40.094
except for the office.

00:24:40.094 --> 00:24:43.016
And even in the
office, the lighting--

00:24:43.016 --> 00:24:45.960
there was just nothing I
could do about the lighting.

00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:49.174
ELIZABETH CHOE: I think that one
of the quickest fixes that you

00:24:49.174 --> 00:24:51.340
can do, and one that'll
make the biggest difference,

00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:54.900
is that it's very slow moving.

00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:58.550
And I think it's because you
are so conscious of fighting

00:24:58.550 --> 00:25:01.170
the tendency that most people
have to deliver their lines too

00:25:01.170 --> 00:25:04.730
quickly that you're talking a
lot slower than you usually do

00:25:04.730 --> 00:25:08.860
in real life, in a way
that is clearly not you.

00:25:08.860 --> 00:25:12.270
And you could actually
just play with speeding up

00:25:12.270 --> 00:25:13.519
how fast the video plays.

00:25:13.519 --> 00:25:15.060
We did that for one
of the people who

00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:16.399
did Science Out Loud, actually.

00:25:16.399 --> 00:25:17.690
The same thing happened to her.

00:25:17.690 --> 00:25:19.273
As soon as the camera
started rolling,

00:25:19.273 --> 00:25:22.070
she would talk just way
slower than she normally does,

00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:25.630
and it just felt really
unnaturally paced.

00:25:25.630 --> 00:25:29.620
And once we bumped up
the speed to, like, 115%,

00:25:29.620 --> 00:25:34.000
it read a lot more normally
and flowed a lot better.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.580
And I think in
general, look at where

00:25:36.580 --> 00:25:40.120
you're cutting into new spaces.

00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:43.210
I think that you erred
on the right side

00:25:43.210 --> 00:25:45.370
for your rough cut, which
is to leave a little bit

00:25:45.370 --> 00:25:48.690
too much room at the beginning
of each of your clips.

00:25:48.690 --> 00:25:51.600
But when you go in,
really, you can shave off

00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:54.740
like a good second, half a
second off of some of the clips

00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:57.630
that you're cutting, too.

00:25:57.630 --> 00:26:00.980
Instead of having a beat and
then your action starting,

00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:04.510
just go straight into the
action already happening.

00:26:04.510 --> 00:26:08.661
So I think that
happen a couple times.

00:26:08.661 --> 00:26:09.660
[SKIPPING THROUGH VIDEO]

00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:15.300
For this opening
shot I mean, just

00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:17.420
start it like half a
beat before you say,

00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:20.190
eating is one of life's
great necessities.

00:26:20.190 --> 00:26:23.150
I think you take
these nice long pauses

00:26:23.150 --> 00:26:27.469
in between some of your thoughts
to really let the viewer gather

00:26:27.469 --> 00:26:28.760
or comprehend what you've said.

00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:31.620
But some of the gaps
are just really long.

00:26:31.620 --> 00:26:34.270
So you can either cut those
out and maybe cut to a close

00:26:34.270 --> 00:26:38.910
up of you talking, or cut
to B-roll in those cases.

00:26:38.910 --> 00:26:40.940
But I think that'll
help a lot with just

00:26:40.940 --> 00:26:44.260
the sense of the movement
of the overall video.

00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:47.420
Did anyone have other comments?

00:26:47.420 --> 00:26:48.800
Yeah, Kenneth.

00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:51.058
AUDIENCE: I remember in there
you were a little scared

00:26:51.058 --> 00:26:52.056
to start filming.

00:26:52.056 --> 00:26:56.444
But I thought you felt pretty
natural in front of us,

00:26:56.444 --> 00:27:00.539
and it didn't feel you
were nervous or anything.

00:27:03.533 --> 00:27:06.277
Apart from the slow speed,
I think actually you

00:27:06.277 --> 00:27:09.022
look quite natural.

00:27:09.022 --> 00:27:11.349
AUDIENCE: I was going
to say that too.

00:27:11.349 --> 00:27:12.515
ELIZABETH CHOE: Yeah, David?

00:27:12.515 --> 00:27:16.008
AUDIENCE: I was thinking
that one way to cut

00:27:16.008 --> 00:27:19.002
that down is when you look at
a clip or you look at a song,

00:27:19.002 --> 00:27:20.501
so you cut right
before the song.

00:27:20.501 --> 00:27:21.959
And then it's like
a straight line.

00:27:23.944 --> 00:27:25.110
ELIZABETH CHOE: Wait, sorry.

00:27:25.110 --> 00:27:26.200
I didn't hear that.

00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:29.823
AUDIENCE: Plus, when you put
the video as well as the sound.

00:27:29.823 --> 00:27:30.906
ELIZABETH CHOE: The sound?

00:27:30.906 --> 00:27:31.403
AUDIENCE: The sound wave.

00:27:31.403 --> 00:27:31.900
ELIZABETH CHOE: Oh, yeah.

00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:32.397
The sound wave.

00:27:32.397 --> 00:27:33.391
Yeah, the sound wave.

00:27:33.391 --> 00:27:34.385
That's a very good tip.

00:27:34.385 --> 00:27:37.864
AUDIENCE: Then I was thinking
that I like the transitions.

00:27:37.864 --> 00:27:39.852
I find the transition
very meaningful,

00:27:39.852 --> 00:27:42.337
and they help you
continue the story.

00:27:45.897 --> 00:27:47.730
ELIZABETH CHOE: What
were you having planned

00:27:47.730 --> 00:27:48.820
on this big section here?

00:27:48.820 --> 00:27:52.504
Was it supposed to be
an animated section?

00:27:52.504 --> 00:27:57.330
AUDIENCE: I've been
looking for images.

00:27:57.330 --> 00:27:59.850
FEMALE IN VIDEO: This is
when we chew, say, an apple.

00:28:03.315 --> 00:28:05.130
AUDIENCE: I think
one part that will

00:28:05.130 --> 00:28:08.265
help that felt really
slow-- but maybe you

00:28:08.265 --> 00:28:11.730
put in there for a visual
pause-- is the middle section

00:28:11.730 --> 00:28:14.974
when you were talking
about putting on braces,

00:28:14.974 --> 00:28:16.515
and you did the
whole sequence of you

00:28:16.515 --> 00:28:18.660
like putting on gloves
like an orthodontist would.

00:28:22.620 --> 00:28:25.104
And it's good for
comedic effect,

00:28:25.104 --> 00:28:28.422
but it kind of interrupted
the video for me.

00:28:28.422 --> 00:28:31.320
And I think this is an instance
of killing your darlings,

00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:34.701
where I don't know how
long it took to film this.

00:28:34.701 --> 00:28:37.599
AUDIENCE: So should cut out
everything in the office?

00:28:37.599 --> 00:28:41.730
AUDIENCE: No, I like--
like when we all laughed,

00:28:41.730 --> 00:28:43.175
that was a great reveal.

00:28:43.175 --> 00:28:45.050
And I think you can
almost cut from this shot

00:28:45.050 --> 00:28:46.550
to the one with
you with braces--

00:28:46.550 --> 00:28:48.313
like when you say, with braces.

00:28:48.313 --> 00:28:51.019
Because you don't even say
anything over this part.

00:28:51.019 --> 00:28:52.220
It was just kind of silent.

00:28:54.502 --> 00:28:55.960
AUDIENCE: I think
she could keep it

00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:59.040
if she tightened it
to like one second.

00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:00.420
We can get enough
out of you just

00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:02.590
putting on-- starting
to put on the glove

00:29:02.590 --> 00:29:04.410
and then transitioning
to the next one.

00:29:04.410 --> 00:29:06.080
I think it's fun.

00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:08.550
I think that I agree with
you that it's too long,

00:29:08.550 --> 00:29:10.810
but I think you could
tighten it, really,

00:29:10.810 --> 00:29:12.597
and it would still
get the impact.

00:29:12.597 --> 00:29:14.680
ELIZABETH CHOE: Comedy is
really hard to pull off,

00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:17.120
like George was saying
in the earlier workshop.

00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:20.700
But a lot of comedy that works
in these types of videos,

00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:23.950
and that you'll see in
SciShow or Veritasium

00:29:23.950 --> 00:29:26.070
or pretty much any
popular YouTube channel,

00:29:26.070 --> 00:29:27.260
is that they're very quick.

00:29:27.260 --> 00:29:31.570
They're quick insertions of
someone making a face or sort

00:29:31.570 --> 00:29:34.790
of an unexpected B-roll shot.

00:29:34.790 --> 00:29:37.490
And I think that I
agree with Jaime.

00:29:37.490 --> 00:29:39.260
And you can play
around with this.

00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:41.320
Play around with taking
this part out completely,

00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:42.900
play around with shortening it.

00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:48.719
But it has a funnier effect
when it's a lot shorter,

00:29:48.719 --> 00:29:51.010
because one, it doesn't
interrupt the flow of the video

00:29:51.010 --> 00:29:51.880
as much.

00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:53.920
And also just gives a
chance for the viewer

00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:56.150
to be like, wait, what
just actually happened?

00:29:56.150 --> 00:29:59.650
It keeps them on their
toes a little bit more.

00:29:59.650 --> 00:30:02.780
AUDIENCE: For that, I
really like that part.

00:30:02.780 --> 00:30:04.200
The only thing I
would suggest is

00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:08.360
that at the end when you reveal
the braces to kind of show them

00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:11.430
for half a second
longer so the viewers

00:30:11.430 --> 00:30:13.199
can notice that it's braces.

00:30:13.199 --> 00:30:15.365
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I think the
braces shot was actually

00:30:15.365 --> 00:30:16.850
a little too short.

00:30:22.886 --> 00:30:24.427
ELIZABETH CHOE: And
like right here--

00:30:24.427 --> 00:30:26.912
AUDIENCE: How did you do that?

00:30:26.912 --> 00:30:27.906
The braces shot?

00:30:27.906 --> 00:30:30.400
Did they just put pretend
braces on you for a minute?

00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:31.983
ELIZABETH CHOE: It
was like a denture.

00:30:31.983 --> 00:30:32.847
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.

00:30:32.847 --> 00:30:34.430
ELIZABETH CHOE: And
this is an example

00:30:34.430 --> 00:30:37.510
of shaving off some of
the beginnings of a clip.

00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:44.000
That is exactly where it starts,
it's a good half a second.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:45.610
Which doesn't seem
like much, but when

00:30:45.610 --> 00:30:48.235
you're watching a video it seems
like an eternity-- half second

00:30:48.235 --> 00:30:51.128
that you can just
take out completely.

00:30:51.128 --> 00:30:55.046
AUDIENCE: So how close
to when the sound starts?

00:30:55.046 --> 00:30:58.700
Should you do it right there?

00:30:58.700 --> 00:31:02.150
ELIZABETH CHOE: I don't have a
best practice of do it like 0.2

00:31:02.150 --> 00:31:03.500
seconds before it starts.

00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:07.120
But I think that, in general,
having it as close to when

00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:09.120
you start talking is best.

00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:12.590
Because otherwise, it reads
a little bit newscastery.

00:31:12.590 --> 00:31:15.470
Because you'll notice that
on a Dateline special,

00:31:15.470 --> 00:31:18.880
the host will go, and
I'll start talking.

00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:22.620
And that's what gives it the
newscastery feel, versus a lot

00:31:22.620 --> 00:31:24.490
of YouTube channels
and SciShow, they just

00:31:24.490 --> 00:31:29.302
go immediately as close to the
soundwave starting as possible.

00:31:29.302 --> 00:31:31.266
AUDIENCE: Bring us
two frames back.

00:31:31.266 --> 00:31:31.757
ELIZABETH CHOE: Two frames back?

00:31:31.757 --> 00:31:33.721
AUDIENCE: I usually go like
two and three frames back.

00:31:33.721 --> 00:31:35.439
And then if that
doesn't sound good,

00:31:35.439 --> 00:31:36.667
then adjust it from there.

00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:48.014
ELIZABETH CHOE: And who's
doing Google Docs for Andrea?

00:31:48.014 --> 00:31:49.180
AUDIENCE: Nathan and Yuliya.

00:31:49.180 --> 00:31:52.720
ELIZABETH CHOE:
Nathan and Yuliya.

00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:54.060
Any last comments for Andrea?

00:31:56.650 --> 00:31:59.850
I do want to emphasize-- and
for the people who are just here

00:31:59.850 --> 00:32:02.880
for today-- it is a
crazy amount of work

00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:05.100
that they're doing in such
a small amount of time.

00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:07.820
We basically spent the
first week not really

00:32:07.820 --> 00:32:09.460
touching cameras whatsoever.

00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:11.440
I mean, they were
doing assignments them,

00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:13.860
but pre-production
takes up so much time.

00:32:13.860 --> 00:32:17.770
So I think that the
scripts that you guys have

00:32:17.770 --> 00:32:20.290
are really, really
tight and really good.

00:32:20.290 --> 00:32:23.270
And I know that you're working
under limited time and very,

00:32:23.270 --> 00:32:24.375
very limited resources.

00:32:24.375 --> 00:32:26.250
Like you were saying,
you didn't have lights.

00:32:26.250 --> 00:32:28.708
And that makes a huge difference
in what your final product

00:32:28.708 --> 00:32:30.350
looks like, so

00:32:30.350 --> 00:32:32.880
I'm really happy to see
that people can identify--

00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:35.387
this is what I think it's
off about this video,

00:32:35.387 --> 00:32:37.220
I think this is what
it would have improved.

00:32:37.220 --> 00:32:38.969
That's the stuff that
really is important.

00:32:38.969 --> 00:32:42.550
And I think the scripts, and
you guys really constructing

00:32:42.550 --> 00:32:44.350
compelling narratives
around the topics

00:32:44.350 --> 00:32:46.890
that you were talking about,
they've come such a long way

00:32:46.890 --> 00:32:47.860
from the first day.

00:32:47.860 --> 00:32:51.348
So I'm really happy to see that.

00:32:51.348 --> 00:32:52.794
AUDIENCE: It's
ready, but I think

00:32:52.794 --> 00:32:53.758
you have to refresh the page.

00:32:53.758 --> 00:32:54.722
ELIZABETH CHOE: Oh, OK.

00:32:59.070 --> 00:32:59.810
This one?

00:32:59.810 --> 00:33:00.700
All right.

00:33:00.700 --> 00:33:03.873
Any words before we screen?

00:33:03.873 --> 00:33:04.914
AUDIENCE: No disclaimers.

00:33:07.487 --> 00:33:08.570
AUDIENCE: Yeah, it's good.

00:33:08.570 --> 00:33:09.750
It's fine, I hope.

00:33:09.750 --> 00:33:13.220
I just didn't like
how I cut it, but I

00:33:13.220 --> 00:33:15.884
think it still is quite well.

00:33:15.884 --> 00:33:17.300
I haven't finished
the animations,

00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:19.560
but yeah, some of it's in.

00:33:30.830 --> 00:33:32.820
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:33:32.820 --> 00:33:34.890
-Imagine holding
a party, and then

00:33:34.890 --> 00:33:38.410
sending out invitations
after the party.

00:33:38.410 --> 00:33:40.839
Wait a minute-- that
doesn't make any sense.

00:33:40.839 --> 00:33:42.630
Are my friends are
going to be able to time

00:33:42.630 --> 00:33:44.840
travel back just so
it's at my party?

00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:46.870
In 2009, Stephen
Hawking actually

00:33:46.870 --> 00:33:50.280
conducted such an experiment
to disprove time travel.

00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:53.760
What exactly is time travel,
and how does it work?

00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:56.655
It actually has a
lot to do with speed.

00:33:56.655 --> 00:33:58.780
A lot of what we know about
time traveling actually

00:33:58.780 --> 00:34:02.120
comes from Einstein's theory of
special and general relativity.

00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:04.340
We are actually time
traveling right now, but not

00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:07.020
in the manner that sci-fi
phi films have depicted them.

00:34:07.020 --> 00:34:11.199
We are, in fact, time traveling
at a pace of one hour per hour.

00:34:11.199 --> 00:34:14.350
In other words, every hour I
experience, the world around me

00:34:14.350 --> 00:34:16.600
experiences a singular hour too.

00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:19.709
Now, it may sound simple and
trivial, but stay with me.

00:34:19.709 --> 00:34:21.125
This is where it
gets interesting.

00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:28.260
Now, the lat part of Einstein's
theory of special relativity

00:34:28.260 --> 00:34:31.360
is actually a phenomenon
known as time dilation.

00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:33.679
Effectively, this means
that the faster you travel,

00:34:33.679 --> 00:34:35.870
the slower time
passes around you.

00:34:35.870 --> 00:34:37.510
It potentially
means that I could

00:34:37.510 --> 00:34:41.400
travel at maybe more
than one hour per hour.

00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:44.330
This phenomenon, however, is
only noticeable at really,

00:34:44.330 --> 00:34:47.690
really high speeds-- speeds
near the speed of light.

00:34:47.690 --> 00:34:51.810
This rocket here,
not even close.

00:34:51.810 --> 00:34:54.159
Say I do a spaceship
now that travels

00:34:54.159 --> 00:34:56.090
at 90% the speed of light.

00:34:56.090 --> 00:34:58.660
And I have a pair newborn twins.

00:34:58.660 --> 00:35:02.170
I bring one of them with me
on this journey for 10 years.

00:35:02.170 --> 00:35:05.980
When I return, one of them
will have turned 23 years old

00:35:05.980 --> 00:35:08.697
while the one with me will
have only turned 10 years old.

00:35:08.697 --> 00:35:10.780
While we have experienced
10 years on a spaceship,

00:35:10.780 --> 00:35:13.020
23 years have actually
passed on Earth.

00:35:13.020 --> 00:35:16.250
This amount of time actually
increases exponentially

00:35:16.250 --> 00:35:19.190
as you get closer to
the speed of light.

00:35:19.190 --> 00:35:23.613
So we could potentially
travel forward in time.

00:35:23.613 --> 00:35:26.571
But what about
backwards in time?

00:35:26.571 --> 00:35:28.543
That's a whole other issue.

00:35:31.501 --> 00:35:33.966
Now, remember our
previous graph.

00:35:33.966 --> 00:35:36.210
The time that
passed on Earth was

00:35:36.210 --> 00:35:38.341
asymptopic to the
speed of light.

00:35:38.341 --> 00:35:40.632
Looks like we're seeing maybe
the secret to time travel

00:35:40.632 --> 00:35:43.470
lies on the other
side of the line.

00:35:43.470 --> 00:35:45.620
In other words, we may
have to travel faster

00:35:45.620 --> 00:35:50.372
than the speed of light just to
be able to travel back in time.

00:35:50.372 --> 00:35:53.858
Now, when you do travel
near the speed of light,

00:35:53.858 --> 00:35:56.846
something called relativistic
mass comes into play.

00:35:56.846 --> 00:36:00.830
In other words, as your speed
goes up, your mass increases.

00:36:00.830 --> 00:36:03.316
As your mass increases,
you require more energy

00:36:03.316 --> 00:36:04.316
to move the same object.

00:36:04.316 --> 00:36:08.051
This might mean that you need
an infinite amount of energy

00:36:08.051 --> 00:36:10.790
just to move an object
beyond the speed of light.

00:36:10.790 --> 00:36:13.944
The more energy you put into
an object, the more likely

00:36:13.944 --> 00:36:16.019
you are to increase
its mass rather than

00:36:16.019 --> 00:36:17.762
to increase its speed.

00:36:17.762 --> 00:36:20.252
Therefore, to get an object
past the speed of light,

00:36:20.252 --> 00:36:23.830
quite impossible at
this point in time.

00:36:23.830 --> 00:36:27.790
So why are we still so
obsessed with time travel?

00:36:27.790 --> 00:36:32.040
Time travel does come with
its own set of problems.

00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:33.690
Take for example
my party before.

00:36:33.690 --> 00:36:36.964
If I were to send out my
invitations after the party,

00:36:36.964 --> 00:36:39.172
my friends would have come
back in time to attend it.

00:36:39.172 --> 00:36:41.450
And if they did come back
in time to attend it,

00:36:41.450 --> 00:36:43.733
I wouldn't have sent
out my invitations.

00:36:43.733 --> 00:36:46.150
And if I didn't send
out my invitations,

00:36:46.150 --> 00:36:48.002
they wouldn't be at my party.

00:36:48.002 --> 00:36:51.360
It doesn't make any sense at all
that they are both at my party

00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:52.750
and not at my party.

00:36:52.750 --> 00:36:55.370
This is what we call
the grandfather paradox.

00:36:55.370 --> 00:36:57.250
It's one of three
time travel problems

00:36:57.250 --> 00:36:59.250
that we currently have.

00:36:59.250 --> 00:37:02.000
So it seems that we may
not be able to time travel

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:05.810
yet, based on what physics
tells us, at least.

00:37:05.810 --> 00:37:09.150
For now, if you are
planning a party,

00:37:09.150 --> 00:37:11.250
be sure to send out the invites.

00:37:11.250 --> 00:37:13.210
Your friends can't
time travel yet.

00:37:13.210 --> 00:37:15.162
[END PLAYBACK]

00:37:15.162 --> 00:37:18.090
[APPLAUSE]

00:37:20.050 --> 00:37:22.920
ELIZABETH CHOE: All right, any
comments from Kenneth first?

00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:25.545
AUDIENCE: OK, I didn't know that
the warp stabilizer on YouTube

00:37:25.545 --> 00:37:26.767
was like that.

00:37:26.767 --> 00:37:29.100
ELIZABETH CHOE: Oh, you tried
the stabilizer on YouTube.

00:37:29.100 --> 00:37:32.870
AUDIENCE: Because I new I had
to stabilize some of my footage,

00:37:32.870 --> 00:37:35.815
and they were taking a
very long time on Premier.

00:37:35.815 --> 00:37:37.190
So I just popped
it on to YouTube

00:37:37.190 --> 00:37:38.648
and just let YouTube
stabilized it.

00:37:38.648 --> 00:37:41.430
But I didn't know that
it did it very liberally.

00:37:44.066 --> 00:37:47.085
So I realize a lot of my shots
got like this warpy effect,

00:37:47.085 --> 00:37:50.270
and some of my text got
cut out, and what not.

00:37:50.270 --> 00:37:53.015
But yeah, and I'm sorry that
the audio for this whole chunk

00:37:53.015 --> 00:37:55.390
just kind of got
warped because I

00:37:55.390 --> 00:37:57.702
had to use my other camera,
which I didn't want to.

00:37:57.702 --> 00:38:00.160
ELIZABETH CHOE: Oh, you used
your DSLR for the middle part,

00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:00.660
right?

00:38:00.660 --> 00:38:02.250
I mean it's a
trade-off, because it

00:38:02.250 --> 00:38:05.060
looks way better than the
camcorders that we have.

00:38:05.060 --> 00:38:06.860
But the camera
that he has doesn't

00:38:06.860 --> 00:38:10.370
have an input for the mic.

00:38:10.370 --> 00:38:12.910
Yeah, it's really hard
to understand that part.

00:38:12.910 --> 00:38:13.410
Yeah, PJ?

00:38:13.410 --> 00:38:14.910
AUDIENCE: With these
scenes, though,

00:38:14.910 --> 00:38:16.912
we were talking about
doing this walking down.

00:38:16.912 --> 00:38:19.372
It was just tough to
have a ten foot tether

00:38:19.372 --> 00:38:20.848
to do some of these.

00:38:20.848 --> 00:38:25.276
And I thought that came out
really good-- that video part.

00:38:25.276 --> 00:38:28.570
AUDIENCE: Could you
try a voiceover?

00:38:28.570 --> 00:38:31.420
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I was thinking
about putting that in.

00:38:31.420 --> 00:38:33.189
AUDIENCE: Because
it's far away enough

00:38:33.189 --> 00:38:35.630
where I don't think it matters.

00:38:35.630 --> 00:38:38.290
ELIZABETH CHOE: Yeah, you could
try lip dubbing basically.

00:38:38.290 --> 00:38:41.140
I have one pair
of wireless mics,

00:38:41.140 --> 00:38:45.090
if you do want to
try shooting it.

00:38:45.090 --> 00:38:47.312
I mean, it may be
a little too much

00:38:47.312 --> 00:38:49.020
to throw in at the
last minute, because I

00:38:49.020 --> 00:38:51.800
do agree that this part is--

00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:52.900
[SKIPPING THROUGH VIDEO]

00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:55.130
It's hard, but I
mean, I also think

00:38:55.130 --> 00:38:56.720
that having that
wide of an angle

00:38:56.720 --> 00:38:58.210
is important in that shot.

00:38:58.210 --> 00:39:00.540
So I understand using
the mic was sort

00:39:00.540 --> 00:39:03.320
of not really an option there.

00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:08.850
But I do think that
voiceover is a good option.

00:39:08.850 --> 00:39:10.120
And especially this part.

00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:11.980
It's a long walk and talk, and--

00:39:11.980 --> 00:39:13.730
MALE IN VIDEO: --example,
my party before.

00:39:13.730 --> 00:39:15.830
If I were to send
out my message--

00:39:15.830 --> 00:39:19.820
ELIZABETH CHOE: And the audio
is so distractingly unclear,

00:39:19.820 --> 00:39:22.964
and this is such a
crucial sort of inherently

00:39:22.964 --> 00:39:24.380
hard to understand
portion anyway,

00:39:24.380 --> 00:39:27.900
that I think that it's really
important to have clear audio.

00:39:27.900 --> 00:39:31.320
And I don't know if you can just
shoot B-roll to do voiceover

00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:33.170
for this.

00:39:33.170 --> 00:39:37.700
Because it's a little-- the
setting and what you're saying

00:39:37.700 --> 00:39:41.240
don't necessarily match
up to me right away.

00:39:41.240 --> 00:39:44.214
But I also like the
feel that you were going

00:39:44.214 --> 00:39:45.380
for with this walk and talk.

00:39:45.380 --> 00:39:49.040
I can tell that you were drawing
a lot of Veritasium influences

00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:52.240
with the beginning, and you
did the whole Michael Stevens

00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:55.300
Vsauce head up, which
I think are fun.

00:39:55.300 --> 00:39:57.680
Because you're taking
something that is typically

00:39:57.680 --> 00:40:03.550
a very robust science topic and
sort of presenting it in a very

00:40:03.550 --> 00:40:05.500
casual, like, I'm
just your friend

00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:07.646
talking about time travel
type of way that makes

00:40:07.646 --> 00:40:08.770
it a lot less intimidating.

00:40:08.770 --> 00:40:09.978
Which I think is really nice.

00:40:09.978 --> 00:40:11.490
It's a nice feel for the video.

00:40:14.610 --> 00:40:17.120
Any comments from anyone else?

00:40:17.120 --> 00:40:18.100
Yeah.

00:40:18.100 --> 00:40:21.390
AUDIENCE: It's sounded really
well in its complete form.

00:40:21.390 --> 00:40:23.550
Even though-- like
the script, there

00:40:23.550 --> 00:40:25.200
was a lot of technical detail.

00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:27.370
It didn't read like that at all.

00:40:27.370 --> 00:40:30.260
The only part here was that when
you were walking and describing

00:40:30.260 --> 00:40:34.260
the grandfather paradox, I
know we also shot the party.

00:40:34.260 --> 00:40:36.250
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I was
thinking of putting

00:40:36.250 --> 00:40:38.160
that in split screen, but I--

00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:40.340
ELIZABETH CHOE: Oh, you
actually shot a fake party?

00:40:40.340 --> 00:40:40.710
AUDIENCE: Yeah

00:40:40.710 --> 00:40:42.570
ELIZABETH CHOE: I think that it
would be a really good option

00:40:42.570 --> 00:40:44.195
to try playing around
with that footage

00:40:44.195 --> 00:40:45.762
and just using voiceover there.

00:40:45.762 --> 00:40:47.470
AUDIENCE: I only put
it at half a screen,

00:40:47.470 --> 00:40:49.579
because I'm keeping to
the left of the screen

00:40:49.579 --> 00:40:50.870
so I have it on the right side.

00:40:50.870 --> 00:40:51.870
ELIZABETH CHOE: Yeah.

00:40:51.870 --> 00:40:54.330
Is it super important
that you maintain

00:40:54.330 --> 00:40:56.050
this footage of you talking?

00:40:56.050 --> 00:40:58.640
Or can you just cut to
straight B-roll of the party?

00:40:58.640 --> 00:41:00.723
AUDIENCE: I thought it
would be a nice transitions

00:41:00.723 --> 00:41:02.079
to walk into the last scene.

00:41:02.079 --> 00:41:03.120
ELIZABETH CHOE: Oh, yeah.

00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:05.370
I mean, I can tell that you
were very conscious of how

00:41:05.370 --> 00:41:07.426
your cuts were being made.

00:41:07.426 --> 00:41:09.176
MALE IN VIDEO: --the
grandfather paradox--

00:41:12.031 --> 00:41:14.280
ELIZABETH CHOE: I think that
this opening one and some

00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:16.690
of your pans are really slow.

00:41:16.690 --> 00:41:19.950
So you could cut the clip
right before it lands on you

00:41:19.950 --> 00:41:21.570
and just speed up the pan.

00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:26.910
This part especially.

00:41:26.910 --> 00:41:28.149
It just feels very nice.

We are, in fact, time traveling
at a pace of one hour per hour.

00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:37.190
ELIZABETH CHOE: The script
is a lot better here.

00:41:37.190 --> 00:41:39.224
It's really good.

00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:43.223
ELIZABETH CHOE: And this too is
a really good visual reference

00:41:43.223 --> 00:41:44.552
there.

00:41:44.552 --> 00:41:45.927
AUDIENCE: I really
liked whatever

00:41:45.927 --> 00:41:47.667
you did to animate the graph.

00:41:47.667 --> 00:41:49.655
I was like, mind blown.

00:41:49.655 --> 00:41:51.146
I don't know if I could do that.

00:41:51.146 --> 00:41:53.631
But it looked really nice
because it followed your finger

00:41:53.631 --> 00:41:54.630
and everything.

00:41:54.630 --> 00:41:56.990
ELIZABETH CHOE: Yeah,
how did you do that?

00:41:56.990 --> 00:41:59.365
AUDIENCE: I kept a
screenshot there,

00:41:59.365 --> 00:42:02.380
and I imported for the shot
that I drew everything over.

00:42:02.380 --> 00:42:04.512
This amount of time
actually increases--

00:42:04.512 --> 00:42:06.970
ELIZABETH CHOE: But YouTube
cut it off right at the bottom.

00:42:06.970 --> 00:42:07.720
OK, that's what I
figured what happened.

00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:08.730
AUDIENCE: Yeah, it was
supposed to be nice frame.

00:42:08.730 --> 00:42:10.972
I don't know why they
even warped this.

00:42:10.972 --> 00:42:13.180
ELIZABETH CHOE: Yeah, I
mean, take the stabilizer out

00:42:13.180 --> 00:42:15.900
and just do a
closeup shot of you.

00:42:15.900 --> 00:42:17.750
Because that's really nice.

00:42:17.750 --> 00:42:20.840
Are you going to do
it for this part too?

00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:22.600
AUDIENCE: I was
thinking that I should.

00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:23.320
ELIZABETH CHOE: I
think you should,

00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:25.340
just because like you're
throwing in the graph

00:42:25.340 --> 00:42:28.664
and you have the asymptote,
and it's just such a key part.

00:42:28.664 --> 00:42:31.080
Something that I didn't know
until you read the script out

00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:32.720
loud to us-- really
cool, the idea

00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:35.080
of looking at the other
side of the graph.

00:42:35.080 --> 00:42:37.680
So, I know it's
more work for you,

00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:39.030
but I think it would look cool.

00:42:42.140 --> 00:42:43.980
Who's commenting on Kennith's?

00:42:47.740 --> 00:42:49.630
AUDIENCE: Yuliya and Andrea.

00:42:49.630 --> 00:42:52.182
ELIZABETH CHOE: Yuliya
and Andrea, great.

00:42:52.182 --> 00:42:53.640
AUDIENCE: I really
like the ending.

00:42:53.640 --> 00:42:55.973
ELIZABETH CHOE: Yeah, the
beginning and ending, you book

00:42:55.973 --> 00:42:57.910
ended it very nicely.

00:42:57.910 --> 00:43:00.330
Very good.

00:43:00.330 --> 00:43:03.320
I'm very happy with how people
have taken their scripts

00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:05.980
and really created a point
and a story around it.

00:43:05.980 --> 00:43:08.300
I don't think any
of these drafts

00:43:08.300 --> 00:43:10.680
are instructional
videos whatsoever.

00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:12.730
You've taken all
these concepts--

00:43:12.730 --> 00:43:14.230
and we talked a lot
at the beginning

00:43:14.230 --> 00:43:18.400
about tying specific
examples and allowing

00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:21.160
a specific instance to let
you hit these bigger points.

00:43:21.160 --> 00:43:23.800
And I think everyone's really
done a nice job of doing that

00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:24.591
with their scripts.

00:43:27.680 --> 00:43:30.040
All right, next
up we have Joshua.

00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:31.550
You ready?

00:43:31.550 --> 00:43:32.790
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:43:32.790 --> 00:43:34.106
ELIZABETH CHOE: Any comments?

00:43:34.106 --> 00:43:36.310
AUDIENCE: I haven't put
in the animations yet,

00:43:36.310 --> 00:43:38.782
so there will be a part
where there's a blank space.

00:43:38.782 --> 00:43:40.990
But the blank table is
supposed to be the animations.

00:43:43.884 --> 00:43:44.550
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:43:44.550 --> 00:43:46.690
-Hi, have you found it
particularly difficult

00:43:46.690 --> 00:43:49.370
to find a specific
item in your house?

00:43:49.370 --> 00:43:51.570
Let's say you're looking
for a pair of gloves,

00:43:51.570 --> 00:43:54.890
but you just can't find it and
you spend your entire afternoon

00:43:54.890 --> 00:43:56.400
looking for it.

00:43:56.400 --> 00:43:58.790
Well, you've just
encountered the same problem

00:43:58.790 --> 00:44:01.590
that companies like
Google or Microsoft

00:44:01.590 --> 00:44:04.390
encounter every single day.

00:44:04.390 --> 00:44:06.660
And that's the
problem of search.

00:44:06.660 --> 00:44:09.500
Just like a house, which stores
thousands of different items,

00:44:09.500 --> 00:44:13.870
Google stores 45 billion
index pages of information.

00:44:13.870 --> 00:44:16.400
When if every page
was a sheet of paper

00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:18.415
and we stick them
up real high, we

00:44:18.415 --> 00:44:24.430
will create a tower 600 times
taller than Mount Everest.

00:44:24.430 --> 00:44:27.000
Well can Google find
my results so quickly

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:31.240
when I find so difficult
to find a pair of gloves?

00:44:31.240 --> 00:44:32.800
Well, searching
on Google is kind

00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:37.220
of looking for a
person in a big school.

00:44:37.220 --> 00:44:40.130
Let's say you're looking for
James in the row of classrooms.

00:44:40.130 --> 00:44:41.850
One of the easiest
method would be

00:44:41.850 --> 00:44:47.180
to go to every classroom nearest
to you until you find James.

00:44:47.180 --> 00:44:50.310
There's a better method
known as binary search.

00:44:50.310 --> 00:44:52.180
Let's say the
students were arranged

00:44:52.180 --> 00:44:57.280
from A to Z in an increasing
number of the classrooms.

00:44:57.280 --> 00:45:00.040
And let's say we head to
the middle room first,

00:45:00.040 --> 00:45:02.880
and if the person in the
middle room isn't James,

00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:05.600
but his name starts
with a letter before j,

00:45:05.600 --> 00:45:06.890
we head to the right.

00:45:06.890 --> 00:45:08.950
If not, we head to the left.

00:45:08.950 --> 00:45:13.440
We then approach the middle room
in the newly sectioned area.

00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:15.320
We rinse and repeat.

00:45:15.320 --> 00:45:18.910
Eventually we will find James
just like the first method,

00:45:18.910 --> 00:45:24.350
but we find him in a much faster
way with the second method.

00:45:24.350 --> 00:45:26.560
How much faster would that be?

00:45:26.560 --> 00:45:29.560
Well, that depends on the number
of students in the school.

00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:32.700
Let's say there are 500 students
and we're looking for one,

00:45:32.700 --> 00:45:35.350
it would take about 80
minutes in the first manner,

00:45:35.350 --> 00:45:38.880
but one and a half minutes
with binary search.

00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:41.510
But let's say they are 1,000
students in the school,

00:45:41.510 --> 00:45:45.260
it would take 160 minutes
with the first method

00:45:45.260 --> 00:45:49.310
but 1.6 minutes with
the second method.

00:45:49.310 --> 00:45:52.390
Now, that's a whole
lot of difference.

00:45:52.390 --> 00:45:54.050
So a name is just a word.

00:45:54.050 --> 00:45:57.720
But Google searches a
combination of words,

00:45:57.720 --> 00:46:00.770
making it a little
bit more complicated.

00:46:00.770 --> 00:46:04.240
So just like how we identify the
first letter of each alphabet

00:46:04.240 --> 00:46:08.970
of the name, Google identifies
200 unique factors making

00:46:08.970 --> 00:46:11.840
your search terms faster.

00:46:11.840 --> 00:46:14.480
If you recall, the
effectiveness of binary search

00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:17.890
depends on the
prearrangement of data.

00:46:17.890 --> 00:46:20.190
And that's why computer
scientist are actively

00:46:20.190 --> 00:46:24.290
looking for ways to sort,
manage, and eventually retrieve

00:46:24.290 --> 00:46:27.310
data fast and better.

00:46:27.310 --> 00:46:31.090
In the same way, the TV
remote goes near the TV,

00:46:31.090 --> 00:46:34.900
the shoes go to the shoe rack,
the coats go into the cupboard

00:46:34.900 --> 00:46:38.300
and the winter gloves go
into the winter jacket.

00:46:38.300 --> 00:46:39.260
Aha!

00:46:39.260 --> 00:46:40.760
So that's where my gloves are.

00:46:40.760 --> 00:46:42.656
[END PLAYBACK]

00:46:42.656 --> 00:46:45.974
[APPLAUSE]

00:46:48.109 --> 00:46:49.900
ELIZABETH CHOE: Joshua,
what are the things

00:46:49.900 --> 00:46:52.108
that you like about your
cut, and what are the things

00:46:52.108 --> 00:46:54.970
that you don't like about it?

00:46:54.970 --> 00:46:56.880
AUDIENCE: I guess
I like the opening.

00:46:56.880 --> 00:47:02.110
But I realize-- there
were times where

00:47:02.110 --> 00:47:06.120
I realized I have a
better take, but it's

00:47:06.120 --> 00:47:10.622
because they clicked it
but I started earlier.

00:47:10.622 --> 00:47:12.080
ELIZABETH CHOE: So
there were takes

00:47:12.080 --> 00:47:13.970
where you got cut off
just at the beginning

00:47:13.970 --> 00:47:14.960
or something like that.

00:47:14.960 --> 00:47:18.030
AUDIENCE: So I realize
I should have much,

00:47:18.030 --> 00:47:20.680
much more takes, because
you never know what happens.

00:47:20.680 --> 00:47:25.140
And I had to scrap
out an entire scene

00:47:25.140 --> 00:47:27.430
because I was in a location
where they had just

00:47:27.430 --> 00:47:29.350
started preparing
for some event,

00:47:29.350 --> 00:47:31.152
and then everything
became very noisy.

00:47:31.152 --> 00:47:33.610
ELIZABETH CHOE: Yeah, so there
were like last minute things

00:47:33.610 --> 00:47:36.570
that came up in your locations.

00:47:36.570 --> 00:47:38.930
AUDIENCE: I do recognize
that the one where

00:47:38.930 --> 00:47:42.370
I'm supposed to do
animations the sound is off,

00:47:42.370 --> 00:47:46.047
and the visuals are
not really there yet.

00:47:46.047 --> 00:47:47.630
ELIZABETH CHOE: You
mean the one where

00:47:47.630 --> 00:47:49.001
you're looking at the desk?

00:47:49.001 --> 00:47:50.250
AUDIENCE: Yeah, at the black--

00:47:50.250 --> 00:47:51.579
[SKIPPING THROUGH VIDEO]

00:47:51.579 --> 00:47:53.870
AUDIENCE: Yeah, there's
supposed to be animations here,

00:47:53.870 --> 00:47:56.670
but I guess this is not
probably the best one.

00:47:56.670 --> 00:47:59.253
ELIZABETH CHOE: You were going
to have your animations come up

00:47:59.253 --> 00:48:00.940
here with your hotel
room-- or your--

00:48:00.940 --> 00:48:02.440
AUDIENCE: If I have
to redo a scene,

00:48:02.440 --> 00:48:06.036
this scene is the most
inconsistent among the rest.

00:48:06.036 --> 00:48:08.410
ELIZABETH CHOE: This was one
where you were filming later

00:48:08.410 --> 00:48:09.070
in the day.

00:48:09.070 --> 00:48:11.430
AUDIENCE: Yes, this
one was my first day,

00:48:11.430 --> 00:48:13.070
but later in the evening.

00:48:13.070 --> 00:48:14.960
And then the next day the rest.

00:48:14.960 --> 00:48:18.389
Everything else in the
next day except this.

00:48:18.389 --> 00:48:20.884
AUDIENCE: I think in
this piece, because A,

00:48:20.884 --> 00:48:22.381
we don't have the
animation, but B,

00:48:22.381 --> 00:48:25.305
your eyes are looking at
the animation as opposed

00:48:25.305 --> 00:48:28.340
to still talking to
the screen-- and I

00:48:28.340 --> 00:48:30.840
think, from my perspective, I
feel like there's a little bit

00:48:30.840 --> 00:48:34.340
more of balance at play there
of connecting with the audience

00:48:34.340 --> 00:48:35.549
a little with your eyes.

00:48:35.549 --> 00:48:37.340
Like if you're going
to reshoot it, for me,

00:48:37.340 --> 00:48:40.550
I think balancing looking
down and still looking back

00:48:40.550 --> 00:48:42.710
instead of just looking
down during the animation

00:48:42.710 --> 00:48:45.550
and then looking
back at the end.

00:48:45.550 --> 00:48:47.722
ELIZABETH CHOE: Looking
at the animation is good.

00:48:47.722 --> 00:48:48.930
It's kind of fun thing to do.

00:48:48.930 --> 00:48:52.779
But again, look and acknowledge
the audience as well.

00:48:52.779 --> 00:48:54.570
I think this one, it's
really just a matter

00:48:54.570 --> 00:48:56.370
of energy level here.

00:48:56.370 --> 00:48:59.220
Overall, your
delivery is very nice.

00:48:59.220 --> 00:49:01.410
It's a very natural.

00:49:01.410 --> 00:49:02.990
I love the script.

00:49:02.990 --> 00:49:05.900
Again, you're taking something
that's very hard to visualize,

00:49:05.900 --> 00:49:07.030
and that's why--

00:49:07.030 --> 00:49:08.120
You know, we were
trying to figure out

00:49:08.120 --> 00:49:09.994
what topic to do when
you were brainstorming,

00:49:09.994 --> 00:49:14.060
and there were just no videos
on binary search, which

00:49:14.060 --> 00:49:15.110
was shocking to me.

00:49:15.110 --> 00:49:17.680
Or there aren't
very many good ones.

00:49:17.680 --> 00:49:20.600
And there aren't very many
videos on how Google works,

00:49:20.600 --> 00:49:21.426
period.

00:49:21.426 --> 00:49:23.300
And it's because it's
very hard to visualize.

00:49:23.300 --> 00:49:25.730
And I think you've
done a nice job.

00:49:25.730 --> 00:49:29.226
The only thing is
this last scene.

00:49:29.226 --> 00:49:32.470
The delivery is great.

00:49:32.470 --> 00:49:35.180
But I almost would like to
see this done in a computer

00:49:35.180 --> 00:49:38.170
lab or something instead of in
front of the Microsoft Office.

00:49:38.170 --> 00:49:42.200
I know that you were trying to
work with sort of that Kendall

00:49:42.200 --> 00:49:46.490
Tech area, but it reads
like a little maybe product

00:49:46.490 --> 00:49:49.020
placement-y.

00:49:49.020 --> 00:49:51.240
So if you want to reshoot
that one if you have time,

00:49:51.240 --> 00:49:54.090
I would say there are
computer labs here that I can

00:49:54.090 --> 00:49:55.770
help get you into if you want.

00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:02.040
Were you going to have
animations in this scene?

00:50:02.040 --> 00:50:05.580
AUDIENCE: This would be
just a number that pops up

00:50:05.580 --> 00:50:07.290
and then a number below.

00:50:07.290 --> 00:50:09.657
ELIZABETH CHOE: I think
that sparing use of labels

00:50:09.657 --> 00:50:11.740
will also help this video
too, like when you first

00:50:11.740 --> 00:50:14.390
introduce the term binary
search, have come up.

00:50:14.390 --> 00:50:16.230
When you talk about the numbers.

00:50:16.230 --> 00:50:18.190
Numbers are hard to keep
track of in a video,

00:50:18.190 --> 00:50:20.310
so just having those pop up.

00:50:20.310 --> 00:50:25.766
AUDIENCE: So it would just
be first measure 80 minutes

00:50:25.766 --> 00:50:27.224
and binary search 1.5.

00:50:27.224 --> 00:50:28.270
ELIZABETH CHOE: Yeah,
something like that.

00:50:28.270 --> 00:50:29.270
Something really simple.

00:50:29.270 --> 00:50:31.480
And you've got a good
background for it,

00:50:31.480 --> 00:50:34.770
so I would go and
take advantage of it.

00:50:34.770 --> 00:50:36.769
AUDIENCE: You have such
a smiley presence that's

00:50:36.769 --> 00:50:38.650
so engaging on the camera.

00:50:38.650 --> 00:50:40.640
You have such positive
energy up there.

00:50:40.640 --> 00:50:43.182
It's like you kind of want to
smile while you're watching it.

00:50:43.182 --> 00:50:44.556
ELIZABETH CHOE:
And again, you're

00:50:44.556 --> 00:50:47.070
taking something that is a
seemingly intimidating subject,

00:50:47.070 --> 00:50:50.340
which again is why it's very
hard to find videos on computer

00:50:50.340 --> 00:50:54.930
science, and even more rare
to find a live hosted video

00:50:54.930 --> 00:50:56.110
on computer science.

00:50:56.110 --> 00:50:57.960
All the ones that are
out there are usually

00:50:57.960 --> 00:51:01.000
some sort of voiceover
animated tutorial,

00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:04.340
and I think that having
you on screen being

00:51:04.340 --> 00:51:07.540
the guide for the audience
with this is very, very nice.

00:51:07.540 --> 00:51:08.520
It's very powerful.

00:51:08.520 --> 00:51:12.240
AUDIENCE: Could you go back to
the beginning of that, where

00:51:12.240 --> 00:51:14.564
you're in front of the
desk and about to point

00:51:14.564 --> 00:51:17.870
at the animation?

00:51:17.870 --> 00:51:20.020
MALE IN VIDEO: --find James.

00:51:20.020 --> 00:51:23.043
There's a better method
known as binary--

00:51:23.043 --> 00:51:25.382
AUDIENCE: I feel like
someone just told you a joke

00:51:25.382 --> 00:51:26.340
and we missed the joke.

00:51:26.340 --> 00:51:29.420
And you're like kind of
about to die laughing.

00:51:29.420 --> 00:51:32.360
I don't know if you guys felt
that same way when you saw it.

00:51:32.360 --> 00:51:34.320
Did someone tell you
something really funny?

00:51:34.320 --> 00:51:35.160
AUDIENCE: I couldn't
figure it out.

00:51:35.160 --> 00:51:36.870
I don't know why I
behaved like that.

00:51:36.870 --> 00:51:38.044
I do remember a joke.

00:51:38.044 --> 00:51:38.960
I did remember a joke.

00:51:41.920 --> 00:51:44.262
AUDIENCE: I wanted to be
like, what was so funny?

00:51:44.262 --> 00:51:46.722
There's something
funny going on here?

00:51:46.722 --> 00:51:49.430
AUDIENCE: I must have saw
something that he was doing.

00:51:49.430 --> 00:51:51.175
Maybe he was in an
awkward position.

00:51:53.999 --> 00:51:55.582
AUDIENCE: I mean, I
think you're going

00:51:55.582 --> 00:51:57.860
to refilm this one
anyway, but if you

00:51:57.860 --> 00:52:00.909
do-- it was funny because in
this moment I was thinking,

00:52:00.909 --> 00:52:03.440
there was something funny
that must have just happened,

00:52:03.440 --> 00:52:06.020
and I don't know what it is.

00:52:06.020 --> 00:52:08.630
ELIZABETH CHOE: What
was I going to say?

00:52:08.630 --> 00:52:11.780
For the shots that you
did at the Koch Institute,

00:52:11.780 --> 00:52:14.580
I think you can
just center this.

00:52:14.580 --> 00:52:16.119
Center it close enough.

00:52:16.119 --> 00:52:18.160
Because I know you're
trying rule of thirds here,

00:52:18.160 --> 00:52:23.200
but there's sort of like-- it's
non-homogeneous distribution

00:52:23.200 --> 00:52:24.907
of this pattern
in the background,

00:52:24.907 --> 00:52:27.240
so it looks a little weird
to have all this extra space.

00:52:27.240 --> 00:52:29.040
So I would go ahead
and just center this.

00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:31.955
What do you guys think about
the music in this video?

00:52:31.955 --> 00:52:33.260
It's good?

00:52:33.260 --> 00:52:35.020
It's a little light-hearted.

00:52:35.020 --> 00:52:38.610
It doesn't play into the
whole computer science

00:52:38.610 --> 00:52:39.830
trope, which is nice.

00:52:39.830 --> 00:52:41.562
I would bring-- go ahead.

00:52:41.562 --> 00:52:44.418
AUDIENCE: I thought it was like
1950s suburbia, middle America

00:52:44.418 --> 00:52:46.165
thing.

00:52:46.165 --> 00:52:48.040
ELIZABETH CHOE: I would
bring down the levels

00:52:48.040 --> 00:52:49.280
just a little bit.

00:52:49.280 --> 00:52:52.230
In the opening it's fine,
but as it progressed,

00:52:52.230 --> 00:52:56.340
I would either up your recorded
levels for your own audio

00:52:56.340 --> 00:52:59.120
or lower the music.

00:52:59.120 --> 00:53:02.230
Once the bass starts driving,
it gets a little distracting.

00:53:06.166 --> 00:53:07.150
Any final comments?

00:53:07.150 --> 00:53:09.610
Who's doing the Google
Docs for Joshua?

00:53:12.562 --> 00:53:15.514
AUDIENCE: David and Nathan.

00:53:15.514 --> 00:53:18.220
Also, just as a
comment, I think you

00:53:18.220 --> 00:53:20.434
did a really,
really excellent job

00:53:20.434 --> 00:53:22.402
with the pacing of your cuts.

00:53:22.402 --> 00:53:24.616
We never explicitly
stated it, but I

00:53:24.616 --> 00:53:28.967
think Elizabeth and I said it
in the computer lab last week.

00:53:28.967 --> 00:53:31.258
You did a really good job
leaving a little bit of space

00:53:31.258 --> 00:53:33.770
at the end of something that
you said for people to absorb.

00:53:33.770 --> 00:53:35.810
But then when you
starting your new scene,

00:53:35.810 --> 00:53:37.490
you cut it right
before you dialog.

00:53:37.490 --> 00:53:40.801
And so the video itself just
felt really, really well-paced

00:53:40.801 --> 00:53:41.747
because of that.

00:53:41.747 --> 00:53:43.810
There was never any
point of it where

00:53:43.810 --> 00:53:45.660
I was waiting for
something to happen.

00:53:45.660 --> 00:53:47.569
It was all just like--

00:53:47.569 --> 00:53:49.110
AUDIENCE: If I were
to add, they have

00:53:49.110 --> 00:53:52.350
that actually I didn't
feel-- I cut once,

00:53:52.350 --> 00:53:53.620
and I felt it was awkward.

00:53:53.620 --> 00:53:57.820
And then I cut again, until it
reached so near to the audio.

00:53:57.820 --> 00:54:03.330
So it was a few times I had to
cut to realize that it awkward.

00:54:03.330 --> 00:54:08.199
Like even for 0.3 seconds,
it would be awkward.

00:54:08.199 --> 00:54:11.160
AUDIENCE: You have really
good instincts to do that.

00:54:11.160 --> 00:54:13.670
ELIZABETH CHOE: And I know
that I have said this ad

00:54:13.670 --> 00:54:16.470
nauseum in the emails,
but I feel like there's

00:54:16.470 --> 00:54:18.850
this sense of fear.

00:54:18.850 --> 00:54:20.690
And maybe it's just
the training that we

00:54:20.690 --> 00:54:22.960
have in our traditional
educational system,

00:54:22.960 --> 00:54:25.530
but we all want to
measure like 20 times

00:54:25.530 --> 00:54:27.740
because heaven forbid we
cut more than once, right?

00:54:27.740 --> 00:54:29.520
And here you're
literally cutting.

00:54:29.520 --> 00:54:33.170
But it's through the process
of cutting and trying

00:54:33.170 --> 00:54:36.970
different things that you
learn what feels right

00:54:36.970 --> 00:54:38.400
and what makes
sense in the video.

00:54:38.400 --> 00:54:41.770
And I don't know of
anyone who has ever made

00:54:41.770 --> 00:54:44.110
a video on their first try.

00:54:44.110 --> 00:54:47.370
Even if they've perfected the
shot list, gotten the best

00:54:47.370 --> 00:54:51.960
script ever, have their
production date down

00:54:51.960 --> 00:54:56.100
to the second, something
will ultimately

00:54:56.100 --> 00:54:58.729
end up happening that
makes you reconsider

00:54:58.729 --> 00:55:00.020
how you're going to cut things.

00:55:00.020 --> 00:55:00.580
And it should.

00:55:00.580 --> 00:55:01.288
It really should.

00:55:01.288 --> 00:55:03.930
I mean, I am really
happy to hear that that's

00:55:03.930 --> 00:55:08.230
what you discovered, because
I think that that goes maybe

00:55:08.230 --> 00:55:10.450
a little against
how we traditionally

00:55:10.450 --> 00:55:13.140
go through school.

00:55:13.140 --> 00:55:16.370
So I'm glad to hear that
you try different things.

00:55:16.370 --> 00:55:18.950
It's OK, do not be
discouraged by having

00:55:18.950 --> 00:55:20.080
to try different cuts.

00:55:20.080 --> 00:55:25.280
It's a productive process
that moves you forward.

00:55:25.280 --> 00:55:29.420
OK, any thoughts from
PJ before we screen?

00:55:29.420 --> 00:55:33.025
AUDIENCE: So there's parts
of the audio that I'm

00:55:33.025 --> 00:55:34.830
moving so I can get the--

00:55:34.830 --> 00:55:35.480
ELIZABETH CHOE: Oh,
you hear a little bit.

00:55:35.480 --> 00:55:35.550
Yeah.

00:55:35.550 --> 00:55:37.394
AUDIENCE: So yeah,
after we do that.

00:55:37.394 --> 00:55:39.699
And then it was
really hard trying

00:55:39.699 --> 00:55:44.136
to keep it-- there's
no-- after watching it,

00:55:44.136 --> 00:55:46.630
it's like two videos.

00:55:46.630 --> 00:55:48.559
It's hard because
it's in one setting,

00:55:48.559 --> 00:55:50.874
and they complete their form.

00:55:50.874 --> 00:55:53.540
And I couldn't find like--

00:55:53.540 --> 00:55:54.790
ELIZABETH CHOE: Music is hard.

00:55:54.790 --> 00:55:57.434
It's so much harder than you
initially think it will be.

00:55:57.434 --> 00:56:00.100
You think, oh you just like slap
something on in the background,

00:56:00.100 --> 00:56:00.750
it'll be fine.

00:56:00.750 --> 00:56:02.920
But it's very time consuming.

00:56:02.920 --> 00:56:05.100
So it's very like--
I don't know.

00:56:05.100 --> 00:56:08.282
It seemed very inspirational
at the beginning.

00:56:08.282 --> 00:56:10.406
ELIZABETH CHOE: Like
inappropriately inspirational.

00:56:10.406 --> 00:56:13.072
AUDIENCE: Friday Night
Lights kind of thing.

00:56:13.072 --> 00:56:14.155
ELIZABETH CHOE: All right.

00:56:14.155 --> 00:56:15.360
Well, let's see.

00:56:15.360 --> 00:56:16.026
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:56:16.026 --> 00:56:20.000
-When we take complex things and
break them into smaller pieces,

00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:22.280
we find out that we know
a lot more about things

00:56:22.280 --> 00:56:23.274
than we think.

00:56:35.220 --> 00:56:37.302
Now let's take
this box-- ORCA I--

00:56:37.302 --> 00:56:39.290
and create damage below
the water line, which

00:56:39.290 --> 00:56:40.373
I've indicated right here.

00:56:54.500 --> 00:56:57.845
As we can see, we've
damaged ORCA I right here.

00:56:57.845 --> 00:57:00.136
Now let's put ORCA I on the
water and see what happens.

00:57:19.976 --> 00:57:23.944
[GURGLING]

00:57:26.430 --> 00:57:29.740
The ORCA I sank due to the
weight of the added water.

00:57:29.740 --> 00:57:35.160
What if the ORCA I contained
cargo, or oil, or even people?

00:57:35.160 --> 00:57:38.939
Now let's take ORCA II
and do the same thing.

00:57:56.930 --> 00:57:58.950
So we can see that
ORCA II did not sink,

00:57:58.950 --> 00:58:01.790
although it is sitting on
an angle towards the bow.

00:58:01.790 --> 00:58:04.470
So why didn't ORCA II sink?

00:58:04.470 --> 00:58:06.750
As easy as it sounds,
this simple demonstration

00:58:06.750 --> 00:58:10.900
is essential to the design
of huge complex ships-- ships

00:58:10.900 --> 00:58:13.430
that are responsible
for carrying about 90%

00:58:13.430 --> 00:58:14.420
of all our stuff.

00:58:14.420 --> 00:58:16.810
As naval architects,
how do we design

00:58:16.810 --> 00:58:19.820
ships carrying our stuff to
make it into port safely and not

00:58:19.820 --> 00:58:20.636
sink?

00:58:20.636 --> 00:58:22.124
Well, why don't we find out?

00:58:34.030 --> 00:58:37.050
Here we have ORCA I and
ORCA II from before.

00:58:37.050 --> 00:58:39.740
Although ORCA I and ORCA II
don't engage in international

00:58:39.740 --> 00:58:42.560
trade, they behave just as
a 1,000-foot container ship

00:58:42.560 --> 00:58:43.990
would.

00:58:43.990 --> 00:58:46.689
Now, let's take a
look in ORCA I. We can

00:58:46.689 --> 00:58:47.980
see that there's nothing in it.

00:58:47.980 --> 00:58:50.500
It's just a box.

00:58:50.500 --> 00:58:53.910
But if we look at
ORCA II, we can

00:58:53.910 --> 00:58:56.970
see that it's subdivided into
these watertight compartments

00:58:56.970 --> 00:58:59.790
by these transverse
watertight bulkheads.

00:58:59.790 --> 00:59:01.790
Now, what that
means is that if we

00:59:01.790 --> 00:59:03.950
were to damage this
ship right here,

00:59:03.950 --> 00:59:06.260
water would only flow
into this compartment.

00:59:06.260 --> 00:59:09.390
It would not go into this
one, this one, or this one.

00:59:09.390 --> 00:59:12.510
That would cause the ship to be
angled or trimmed in the water,

00:59:12.510 --> 00:59:15.890
but it would not cause the
ship to sink completely.

00:59:15.890 --> 00:59:18.490
We refer to ORCA II
as being subdivided,

00:59:18.490 --> 00:59:21.726
and we can see subdivision in
many of these ship's plans.

00:59:21.726 --> 00:59:23.780
It is unclear when
subdivision first

00:59:23.780 --> 00:59:26.970
started being used in ships,
but accounts of 5th century

00:59:26.970 --> 00:59:29.500
Chinese trade ships
indicate that water

00:59:29.500 --> 00:59:31.920
would be able to enter the
vessel without sinking.

00:59:31.920 --> 00:59:34.740
So let's find out
why this happens.

00:59:34.740 --> 00:59:38.670
Let's imagine a barge divided
into 10 equal compartments.

00:59:38.670 --> 00:59:41.360
One of them springs
a leak from damage.

00:59:41.360 --> 00:59:44.180
Since the ship is subdivided,
only the first compartment

00:59:44.180 --> 00:59:46.250
floods, and the
ship remains afloat,

00:59:46.250 --> 00:59:48.710
protecting both its
people and cargo.

00:59:48.710 --> 00:59:51.020
Although the added water
causes a ship to trim,

00:59:51.020 --> 00:59:53.760
it still has enough buoyancy
to return to port for repairs.

00:59:58.080 --> 00:59:59.680
Ships still sink, though.

00:59:59.680 --> 01:00:01.460
It's both expensive
and impractical

01:00:01.460 --> 01:00:03.377
to try to design
the unsinkable ship,

01:00:03.377 --> 01:00:04.960
especially when these
ships will never

01:00:04.960 --> 01:00:06.900
see that amount of damage.

01:00:06.900 --> 01:00:08.570
That's why, as
naval architects, we

01:00:08.570 --> 01:00:13.160
use computer programs to
help us out with subdivision.

01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:15.650
Computers make it easy to
simulate certain damage

01:00:15.650 --> 01:00:18.470
cases in practically no time.

01:00:18.470 --> 01:00:21.770
With different software, we can
damage certain compartments,

01:00:21.770 --> 01:00:24.190
and see how the
ship responds to it.

01:00:24.190 --> 01:00:26.390
This gives the naval
architect a good idea

01:00:26.390 --> 01:00:30.110
of what parts to improve
on the ship, if any.

01:00:30.110 --> 01:00:33.710
So even though ships seem
like these intricate, complex

01:00:33.710 --> 01:00:36.350
things, they're really
just based on principles

01:00:36.350 --> 01:00:37.511
that we all already know.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:59.360
[APPLAUSE]

01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:00.330
[END PLAYBACK]

01:01:00.330 --> 01:01:01.913
ELIZABETH CHOE: Just
out of curiosity,

01:01:01.913 --> 01:01:03.502
did you shoot this
video in sequence?

01:01:03.502 --> 01:01:05.460
Like, you shot the first
scenes first, second--

01:01:05.460 --> 01:01:07.720
AUDIENCE: So the first
scenes were second.

01:01:07.720 --> 01:01:08.929
The second scenes were first.

01:01:08.929 --> 01:01:09.886
ELIZABETH CHOE: Really?

01:01:09.886 --> 01:01:10.522
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:01:10.522 --> 01:01:12.860
That wasn't out
of design, it was

01:01:12.860 --> 01:01:16.330
just because the the only time
we could go there was day.

01:01:16.330 --> 01:01:20.130
ELIZABETH CHOE: Yeah, it's a
location practicality there.

01:01:20.130 --> 01:01:22.387
Any comments for PJ?

01:01:22.387 --> 01:01:24.220
AUDIENCE: I didn't feel
the change of music,

01:01:24.220 --> 01:01:25.895
as in, it was natural.

01:01:25.895 --> 01:01:28.089
I didn't feel like there
was a sudden change.

01:01:28.089 --> 01:01:28.630
AUDIENCE: OK.

01:01:28.630 --> 01:01:30.296
ELIZABETH CHOE: I
liked the second song.

01:01:30.296 --> 01:01:33.192
I agree that the first one is
a little Friday Night Lights.

01:01:33.192 --> 01:01:40.920
[LAUGHTER]

01:01:40.920 --> 01:01:43.460
ELIZABETH CHOE: The thing
with-- just like comedy,

01:01:43.460 --> 01:01:47.150
pulling off drama is also really
hard to do in YouTube videos,

01:01:47.150 --> 01:01:50.732
because you're not working
with, like, a sweeping epic

01:01:50.732 --> 01:01:51.440
or a documentary.

01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:53.520
It's like a little
YouTube blurb,

01:01:53.520 --> 01:01:55.420
and we had trouble
with that with Farts

01:01:55.420 --> 01:02:01.290
when he talks about how
Clostridium difficile kills

01:02:01.290 --> 01:02:04.680
some thousand Americans a year.

01:02:04.680 --> 01:02:08.220
We didn't want to have grandpa's
banjo playing in the background

01:02:08.220 --> 01:02:11.510
when he says that, obviously.

01:02:11.510 --> 01:02:16.380
But it's not like we were
going to insert music

01:02:16.380 --> 01:02:20.710
from Gone with the Wind
in the background either.

01:02:20.710 --> 01:02:24.225
AUDIENCE: Well, one thing
that I wanted to try music

01:02:24.225 --> 01:02:28.085
because a lot of the places
I was in, there was-- you

01:02:28.085 --> 01:02:30.956
can see there's a lot of
cuts, so where it goes to,

01:02:30.956 --> 01:02:33.788
and if there's not
anything underneath,

01:02:33.788 --> 01:02:35.680
it's very pronounced.

01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:38.526
And I tried editing
a lot of it out.

01:02:43.067 --> 01:02:44.150
ELIZABETH CHOE: Let's see.

01:02:44.150 --> 01:02:46.005
So I know that you were
hesitant about being

01:02:46.005 --> 01:02:47.150
in front of the camera too.

01:02:47.150 --> 01:02:48.176
AUDIENCE: So natural.

01:02:48.176 --> 01:02:49.550
ELIZABETH CHOE:
And I'm surprised

01:02:49.550 --> 01:02:50.910
that you said you filmed
them in the rivers,

01:02:50.910 --> 01:02:52.870
because I feel like the stuff
that you have in the end

01:02:52.870 --> 01:02:55.220
is really, really natural,
and I thought that you would

01:02:55.220 --> 01:02:57.380
have maybe done that second.

01:02:57.380 --> 01:03:01.250
It's hard to host while
you're doing a demo.

01:03:01.250 --> 01:03:03.360
You just have a million
things to think about.

01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:06.380
But in general, the
hosting is really nice.

01:03:06.380 --> 01:03:11.560
It's really, really natural,
especially this part.

01:03:11.560 --> 01:03:15.370
I can tell that Yuliya
and-- who was it--

01:03:15.370 --> 01:03:16.560
David was filming with you?

01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:17.310
AUDIENCE: Kenneth.

01:03:17.310 --> 01:03:19.270
ELIZABETH CHOE: Kenneth
was filming with you.

01:03:19.270 --> 01:03:20.720
They probably tried to make
you laugh in some of them

01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:20.874
and smile.

01:03:20.874 --> 01:03:23.040
AUDIENCE: Yeah, they were
really good at doing that.

01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:24.660
ELIZABETH CHOE: Yeah.

01:03:24.660 --> 01:03:27.701
I think this scene is
your strongest hosting.

01:03:27.701 --> 01:03:29.950
Just, like, going back and
forth between the computer,

01:03:29.950 --> 01:03:32.630
this scene just plays
out very nicely.

01:03:32.630 --> 01:03:35.290
And again, taking a seemingly
intimidating subject,

01:03:35.290 --> 01:03:38.310
and welcoming and
inviting the viewers in.

01:03:38.310 --> 01:03:40.230
It's very nice.

01:03:40.230 --> 01:03:42.560
I would say, in general,
the cutting advice

01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:44.880
that [INAUDIBLE] gave,
which is to leave

01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:48.560
the room at the end of cuts--
or at the end of scenes--

01:03:48.560 --> 01:03:50.590
and cut very close
to when you start

01:03:50.590 --> 01:03:55.133
talking at the beginning of
scenes, might help with this.

01:03:55.133 --> 01:03:55.758
There was one--

01:03:58.926 --> 01:04:01.550
AUDIENCE: Is it the moment where
Yuliya's in the picture with--

01:04:01.550 --> 01:04:01.890
ELIZABETH CHOE: Oh, yeah.

01:04:01.890 --> 01:04:03.578
That's, like, a
weird insert thing.

01:04:03.578 --> 01:04:04.994
AUDIENCE: I was,
like, who is she?

01:04:04.994 --> 01:04:07.424
What is she doing here?

01:04:07.424 --> 01:04:09.860
She needs to get cut out.

01:04:09.860 --> 01:04:12.780
ELIZABETH CHOE: In general,
I love the speed up walk,

01:04:12.780 --> 01:04:14.762
and how you open the
door into the lab.

01:04:14.762 --> 01:04:15.970
I love seeing the background.

01:04:15.970 --> 01:04:17.210
It's very cool.

01:04:17.210 --> 01:04:19.855
I think you can speed
up you damaging ORCA I.

01:04:19.855 --> 01:04:20.397
AUDIENCE: OK.

01:04:20.397 --> 01:04:22.605
ELIZABETH CHOE: And I think,
you say something like--

01:04:22.605 --> 01:04:25.030
AUDIENCE: Let's take this box--
ORCA I-- and create damage

01:04:25.030 --> 01:04:27.520
below the water line, which
I've indicated right here.

01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:27.780
ELIZABETH CHOE: Yeah.

01:04:27.780 --> 01:04:30.230
I think you can actually cut
that part out completely,

01:04:30.230 --> 01:04:32.892
because after you cut it,
you say, as you can see,

01:04:32.892 --> 01:04:35.350
we've damaged ORCA I, so I
think that's enough information.

01:04:37.929 --> 01:04:39.970
And I get what you're
saying with the water line,

01:04:39.970 --> 01:04:43.130
but I don't think it's
super relevant to the point

01:04:43.130 --> 01:04:46.080
of the video, so I think it's
OK if you cut that out entirely.

01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:47.935
Oh, yeah, when you
go from this scene--

01:04:47.935 --> 01:04:50.025
AUDIENCE: --in the weight
of the added water.

01:04:50.025 --> 01:04:54.075
What if the ORCA I contained
cargo, or oil, or even people?

01:04:54.075 --> 01:04:54.950
ELIZABETH CHOE: Yeah.

01:04:54.950 --> 01:04:58.910
The music here is,
like, it's like trying

01:04:58.910 --> 01:05:02.400
to pull out my heartstrings.

01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:06.034
AUDIENCE: Now let's take ORCA
II and do the same thing.

01:05:10.390 --> 01:05:14.500
We can see that ORCA II did
not sink-- ORCA II sink.

01:05:14.500 --> 01:05:16.750
As easy as it sounds,
this simple demonstration

01:05:16.750 --> 01:05:20.860
is essential to the design
of huge complex ships.

01:05:20.860 --> 01:05:22.755
So why didn't ORCA II sink?

01:05:22.755 --> 01:05:24.380
ELIZABETH CHOE: So
this is an example--

01:05:24.380 --> 01:05:28.435
it happened one other time where
you leave a gap in between some

01:05:28.435 --> 01:05:31.070
of your sentences, and
the gap is a little long.

01:05:31.070 --> 01:05:38.720
So you can cut to a digital
zoom of the same shot

01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:41.220
to clean up the
gap a little bit.

01:05:41.220 --> 01:05:43.640
Because I think that you were
doing it to help you host,

01:05:43.640 --> 01:05:45.640
and, like, help you get
through the lines, which

01:05:45.640 --> 01:05:48.020
is totally OK and
understandable,

01:05:48.020 --> 01:05:50.340
but I would just hide
that gap a little.

01:05:50.340 --> 01:05:53.975
AUDIENCE: I stuttered here,
and I kept looking back

01:05:53.975 --> 01:05:55.987
to the boat, so it
was weird, like I

01:05:55.987 --> 01:05:57.445
was using that
almost as my crutch,

01:05:57.445 --> 01:05:59.890
that I had this prop that I
could kind of like square up.

01:05:59.890 --> 01:06:01.130
ELIZABETH CHOE: I think
you actually were--

01:06:01.130 --> 01:06:02.670
your delivery was fine here.

01:06:02.670 --> 01:06:03.760
I wasn't distracted by it.

01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:05.884
AUDIENCE: --II did not
sink, although it is sitting

01:06:05.884 --> 01:06:07.620
an angle towards the bow.

01:06:07.620 --> 01:06:08.914
So why didn't ORCA II sink?

01:06:08.914 --> 01:06:11.080
ELIZABETH CHOE: I like the
way you ask the question.

01:06:11.080 --> 01:06:13.127
That's, like, how
you would normally.

01:06:13.127 --> 01:06:14.460
AUDIENCE: As easy as it sounds--

01:06:14.460 --> 01:06:16.110
ELIZABETH CHOE: And see how
that gap feels just a little bit

01:06:16.110 --> 01:06:16.610
too long.

01:06:16.610 --> 01:06:18.790
AUDIENCE: --this simple
demonstration is essential

01:06:18.790 --> 01:06:21.550
to the design of
huge complex ships--

01:06:21.550 --> 01:06:24.545
ships that are responsible
for carrying about 90%--

01:06:24.545 --> 01:06:26.700
ELIZABETH CHOE: Do you
have B-roll or pictures

01:06:26.700 --> 01:06:27.800
of some of these ships?

01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:29.110
That was the one
thing I was thinking

01:06:29.110 --> 01:06:30.526
throughout this
video was, like, I

01:06:30.526 --> 01:06:33.070
would love to see what the
things look like in real life.

01:06:33.070 --> 01:06:35.170
AUDIENCE: I could probably
do something like that.

01:06:35.170 --> 01:06:36.340
ELIZABETH CHOE: I think
this would be a great place

01:06:36.340 --> 01:06:38.160
to cut to B-roll or pictures.

01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:40.510
You can just keep the audio,
but that would help mix

01:06:40.510 --> 01:06:42.610
up the visuals a lot too.

01:06:42.610 --> 01:06:44.319
AUDIENCE: --of
all our stuff is--

01:06:44.319 --> 01:06:45.110
ELIZABETH CHOE: OK.

01:06:45.110 --> 01:06:47.160
So this cut was a
little-- this was

01:06:47.160 --> 01:06:52.310
what I was talking about
with the line of sight

01:06:52.310 --> 01:06:54.190
when I gave the editing lecture.

01:06:54.190 --> 01:06:59.476
In the one scene, you're kind
of sitting like this, right?

01:06:59.476 --> 01:07:03.576
And you have, like-- this
is a terrible drawing.

01:07:03.576 --> 01:07:06.460
But you have your boat in the
water, and it's sort of, like,

01:07:06.460 --> 01:07:07.600
a weird semi-bird's-eye.

01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:11.110
And then you cut,
and you're not quite

01:07:11.110 --> 01:07:13.132
in a different enough
position, so it feels

01:07:13.132 --> 01:07:14.340
just, like, slightly jarring.

01:07:14.340 --> 01:07:16.210
It feels like someone
just tipped the camera

01:07:16.210 --> 01:07:17.410
over a little bit.

01:07:17.410 --> 01:07:22.220
So either cut to a
closer shot of you

01:07:22.220 --> 01:07:28.500
like that, to hide that a
little bit, or do B-roll there.

01:07:28.500 --> 01:07:30.685
If you're coming
out of B-roll here,

01:07:30.685 --> 01:07:32.310
then this transition
won't be as weird,

01:07:32.310 --> 01:07:36.420
and my comment is totally
irrelevant, but just

01:07:36.420 --> 01:07:39.471
something to think about.

01:07:39.471 --> 01:07:41.544
AUDIENCE: I mean,
so-- sorry, I'm,

01:07:41.544 --> 01:07:47.050
like, 10 steps ahead of my head,
where I am in actual reality.

01:07:47.050 --> 01:07:49.960
You never put your
Coast Guard outfit on.

01:07:49.960 --> 01:07:50.930
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:07:50.930 --> 01:07:53.597
I felt like if I
wanted to try to make

01:07:53.597 --> 01:07:58.390
it seem like less,
like, me talking,

01:07:58.390 --> 01:08:01.283
that would have just put on
a whole different persona.

01:08:01.283 --> 01:08:03.074
So I kind of, like,
I'm wearing boat shoes,

01:08:03.074 --> 01:08:05.785
so that's hard to do.

01:08:05.785 --> 01:08:06.326
AUDIENCE: OK.

01:08:06.326 --> 01:08:10.260
I just wonder if at the
very, very last scene, where

01:08:10.260 --> 01:08:14.048
you have your finale comment
about a very simple concept

01:08:14.048 --> 01:08:17.229
as floating, if ever
there were a moment

01:08:17.229 --> 01:08:21.100
to put that hat on, and have
your awesome Coast Guard

01:08:21.100 --> 01:08:23.677
outfit on, that would be it.

01:08:23.677 --> 01:08:25.760
ELIZABETH CHOE: If you
don't want to shoot it now,

01:08:25.760 --> 01:08:27.593
we're going to make you
do it next week when

01:08:27.593 --> 01:08:28.785
we shoot season 3, OK?

01:08:28.785 --> 01:08:29.410
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:08:29.410 --> 01:08:30.660
Got to go to the dry cleaners.

01:08:32.207 --> 01:08:34.040
ELIZABETH CHOE: Yeah,
that's a good comment.

01:08:34.040 --> 01:08:35.415
AUDIENCE: The
thing that you have

01:08:35.415 --> 01:08:37.575
that's so cool is, I mean,
we talked about the fact

01:08:37.575 --> 01:08:40.729
that you actually,
legitimately, are out there

01:08:40.729 --> 01:08:41.895
in the Coast Guard.

01:08:41.895 --> 01:08:45.364
And you say that, but
showing us that in your film

01:08:45.364 --> 01:08:46.600
is really powerful.

01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:48.680
And even if, at
just the very end,

01:08:48.680 --> 01:08:51.693
you tie that real
life application back,

01:08:51.693 --> 01:08:53.609
I think that would be
really, incredibly cool.

01:08:53.609 --> 01:08:55.567
ELIZABETH CHOE: Just for
the last sentence too.

01:08:55.567 --> 01:08:57.270
And again, like, time
permitting, right?

01:08:57.270 --> 01:08:59.660
Because I know that you guys
don't have a ton of time

01:08:59.660 --> 01:09:03.800
to incorporate all this stuff.

01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:05.555
You've already gotten
plenty of footage

01:09:05.555 --> 01:09:07.479
of you talking in
this setting, so it

01:09:07.479 --> 01:09:09.189
wouldn't be very
jarring to have you

01:09:09.189 --> 01:09:14.061
say the last sentence, like,
out by the sea, or by the boats.

01:09:14.061 --> 01:09:15.727
AUDIENCE: Or even if
when you say, like,

01:09:15.727 --> 01:09:19.136
I'm a Coast Guard, whatever,
even if you quickly

01:09:19.136 --> 01:09:23.020
have a picture of even photos of
you in uniform, to just put-- I

01:09:23.020 --> 01:09:23.520
don't know.

01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:25.020
I don't know how
that would look.

01:09:25.020 --> 01:09:27.662
But just something that
shows us, and doesn't tell us

01:09:27.662 --> 01:09:31.466
this totally authentic side
to yourself would be cool.

01:09:31.466 --> 01:09:35.714
AUDIENCE: So do you have
access to the base here?

01:09:35.714 --> 01:09:37.130
AUDIENCE: To the
one in North End?

01:09:37.130 --> 01:09:37.755
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:09:37.755 --> 01:09:39.557
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:09:39.557 --> 01:09:40.807
AUDIENCE: Because one of our--

01:09:40.807 --> 01:09:42.667
AUDIENCE: They
have shirts there.

01:09:42.667 --> 01:09:43.292
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:09:43.292 --> 01:09:46.771
I mean, one of the Sloan
fellows is also an officer.

01:09:46.771 --> 01:09:47.762
AUDIENCE: OK.

01:09:47.762 --> 01:09:48.262
[INAUDIBLE]?

01:09:48.262 --> 01:09:50.703
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:09:50.703 --> 01:09:51.244
AUDIENCE: No.

01:09:51.244 --> 01:09:54.569
He's based in there.

01:09:54.569 --> 01:09:56.110
ELIZABETH CHOE: So
again, I know it's

01:09:56.110 --> 01:09:58.770
short notice-- you'd have to do
it between today and tomorrow,

01:09:58.770 --> 01:10:00.650
basically, so it's OK
if you can't do it,

01:10:00.650 --> 01:10:05.120
but something to think
about, if you want

01:10:05.120 --> 01:10:07.100
to do it for Science Out Loud.

01:10:07.100 --> 01:10:08.450
All right.

01:10:08.450 --> 01:10:10.115
Yuliya, you ready?

01:10:10.115 --> 01:10:10.740
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:10:10.740 --> 01:10:13.559
So there are-- the beginning
and the end, we filmed outside.

01:10:13.559 --> 01:10:15.850
There's a lot of wind, and
I couldn't connect the mike,

01:10:15.850 --> 01:10:17.430
because I was standing far away.

01:10:17.430 --> 01:10:19.020
So I tried to do voiceover.

01:10:19.020 --> 01:10:21.335
I don't know how it
sounds, because honestly, I

01:10:21.335 --> 01:10:24.400
was just tired of hearing
my voice at that point.

01:10:24.400 --> 01:10:27.310
And then, there is this,
actually, like the thumbnail,

01:10:27.310 --> 01:10:29.600
this is where the animation
is supposed to be.

01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:33.583
So the white screen
is animations.

01:10:33.583 --> 01:10:34.581
ELIZABETH CHOE: Yeah?

01:10:34.581 --> 01:10:36.577
AUDIENCE: David and
Kenneth are the ones

01:10:36.577 --> 01:10:40.070
who are Google Doc
commenting on this.

01:10:40.070 --> 01:10:41.567
ELIZABETH CHOE: Thank you.

01:10:41.567 --> 01:10:43.608
And we'll go through it
again if you guys forget.

01:10:46.058 --> 01:10:47.056
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

01:10:47.056 --> 01:10:50.549
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:10:53.543 --> 01:10:54.560
-Hi.

01:10:54.560 --> 01:10:58.400
What do snowflakes and
cellphones have in common?

01:10:58.400 --> 01:11:01.590
Well, let me start by
drawing a snowflake first.

01:11:01.590 --> 01:11:05.220
I draw an equilateral
triangle, divide each side

01:11:05.220 --> 01:11:09.730
into three parts, and draw
another equilateral triangle

01:11:09.730 --> 01:11:11.600
on top of each one.

01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:13.900
Then take out the
middle, and repeat

01:11:13.900 --> 01:11:17.520
the process, this time
with 1, 2, 3, 4 times

01:11:17.520 --> 01:11:19.650
3, which is 12 sides.

01:11:19.650 --> 01:11:22.970
Eventually, the shape will start
looking something like this.

01:11:22.970 --> 01:11:26.010
In mathematics, this is
called a Koch snowflake.

01:11:26.010 --> 01:11:28.820
If I repeated my
process again and again,

01:11:28.820 --> 01:11:32.570
I would see this same
pattern anywhere I looked.

01:11:32.570 --> 01:11:36.180
This is a Koch snowflake,
this time drawn on a computer.

01:11:36.180 --> 01:11:38.720
Such neverending patterns,
that on any scale,

01:11:38.720 --> 01:11:40.800
on any level of zoom,
look roughly the same,

01:11:40.800 --> 01:11:42.780
are called fractals.

01:11:42.780 --> 01:11:45.660
Computer scientists can
program these patterns

01:11:45.660 --> 01:11:48.300
by repeating an often
simple mathematical process

01:11:48.300 --> 01:11:49.810
over and over.

01:11:49.810 --> 01:11:54.300
In the 1990s, a radio astronomer
by the name of Nathan Cohen

01:11:54.300 --> 01:11:58.480
used fractals to revolutionize
wireless communications.

01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:01.810
At the time, Cohen was having
troubles with his landlord.

01:12:01.810 --> 01:12:04.230
The man wouldn't let him
put an antenna on his roof.

01:12:04.230 --> 01:12:09.810
So Cohen designed a more compact
fractal radio antenna instead.

01:12:09.810 --> 01:12:12.770
The landlord didn't notice
it, and it worked better

01:12:12.770 --> 01:12:14.470
than the ones before.

01:12:14.470 --> 01:12:18.010
Working further, Cohen
designed a new antenna,

01:12:18.010 --> 01:12:22.016
this time using a fractal
called the Menger sponge.

01:12:22.016 --> 01:12:24.234
The Menger sponge is
not really the sponge

01:12:24.234 --> 01:12:25.650
you'd be scrubbing
your back with,

01:12:25.650 --> 01:12:27.875
but you can still
think of it like that.

01:12:27.875 --> 01:12:30.850
Imagine both water and soap
getting through your sponge's

01:12:30.850 --> 01:12:34.660
holes, except the water
is Wi-Fi, and the soap is,

01:12:34.660 --> 01:12:36.400
say, Bluetooth.

01:12:36.400 --> 01:12:38.150
The fractal's
infinite sponginess

01:12:38.150 --> 01:12:40.690
allows it to receive many
different frequencies

01:12:40.690 --> 01:12:41.640
simultaneously.

01:12:41.640 --> 01:12:44.150
Before Cohen's
invention, antennas

01:12:44.150 --> 01:12:47.400
had to be cut for one frequency,
and that was the only frequency

01:12:47.400 --> 01:12:48.590
they could operate at.

01:12:48.590 --> 01:12:51.032
Without Cohen's
sponge, your cell phone

01:12:51.032 --> 01:12:52.990
would have to look
something like a [INAUDIBLE]

01:12:52.990 --> 01:12:55.480
to receive multiple
signals, including

01:12:55.480 --> 01:12:58.260
the one your friends
use when they call.

01:12:58.260 --> 01:13:00.740
Cohen later proved that
only fractal shapes

01:13:00.740 --> 01:13:03.090
could work with such a
wide range of frequencies.

01:13:03.090 --> 01:13:05.650
Today, millions of
wireless devices,

01:13:05.650 --> 01:13:07.990
such as laptops and
bar code scanners,

01:13:07.990 --> 01:13:10.680
use Cohen's fractal antenna.

01:13:10.680 --> 01:13:12.730
Cohen's genius
invention, however,

01:13:12.730 --> 01:13:15.520
was not the first application
of fractals in the world.

01:13:15.520 --> 01:13:17.530
Nature has been doing
it the whole time,

01:13:17.530 --> 01:13:19.100
and not just the snowflakes.

01:13:19.100 --> 01:13:21.890
Natural selection favors
the most efficient systems

01:13:21.890 --> 01:13:24.480
and organisms, often
of a fractal form.

01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:26.120
The spiral fractal,
for example, is

01:13:26.120 --> 01:13:30.100
present in seashells,
broccoli, and hurricanes.

01:13:30.100 --> 01:13:32.850
The fractal tree is
relatively easy to program,

01:13:32.850 --> 01:13:35.600
and can be used to study
river systems, blood

01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:38.150
vessels, and lightning bolts.

01:13:38.150 --> 01:13:40.770
So many natural systems
previously thought off limits

01:13:40.770 --> 01:13:45.248
to mathematicians can now be
explained in terms of fractals.

01:13:45.248 --> 01:13:48.375
Mathematics allows us to
learn nature's best practices

01:13:48.375 --> 01:13:51.450
and then apply them to
solve real world problems.

01:13:51.450 --> 01:13:54.616
Much like Cohen's antenna
revolutionized the field

01:13:54.616 --> 01:13:58.186
of telecommunications,
other fractal research

01:13:58.186 --> 01:14:00.310
is changing medicine,
weather prediction,

01:14:00.310 --> 01:14:05.886
and building design here at MIT
and everywhere in the world.

01:14:05.886 --> 01:14:06.878
Look around you.

01:14:06.878 --> 01:14:09.358
What beautiful
patterns do you see?

01:14:17.207 --> 01:14:17.790

01:14:17.790 --> 01:14:20.766
[APPLAUSE]

01:14:21.667 --> 01:14:22.750
ELIZABETH CHOE: All right.

01:14:27.730 --> 01:14:29.635
Any thoughts from anyone?

01:14:29.635 --> 01:14:31.530
Should we dive right in?

01:14:31.530 --> 01:14:35.555
Yuliya, what are your favorite
and least favorite parts

01:14:35.555 --> 01:14:36.290
about this cut?

01:14:42.807 --> 01:14:43.640
AUDIENCE: Let's see.

01:14:43.640 --> 01:14:46.930
There was some scenes that
I liked better than others.

01:14:46.930 --> 01:14:49.190
That's mostly because of
the lighting and the sound.

01:14:49.190 --> 01:14:53.595
I think the one in
the classroom had

01:14:53.595 --> 01:14:57.020
a nice sound and nice lighting.

01:14:57.020 --> 01:15:01.595
So I guess the indoor scenes
were a lot easier to shoot.

01:15:07.690 --> 01:15:12.680
ELIZABETH CHOE: So I
think, in general, again,

01:15:12.680 --> 01:15:14.020
very nice script.

01:15:14.020 --> 01:15:18.280
This came such a long way from
the initial ideation phase,

01:15:18.280 --> 01:15:21.357
and I think it is, like
computer science-- I mean,

01:15:21.357 --> 01:15:23.940
my favorite thing about all the
videos that you guys have done

01:15:23.940 --> 01:15:27.190
is the topics are so unique,
and so different than what

01:15:27.190 --> 01:15:28.569
people normally get in school.

01:15:28.569 --> 01:15:30.110
And they're taking
all these concepts

01:15:30.110 --> 01:15:32.235
that they've learned in
school, but just putting it

01:15:32.235 --> 01:15:33.402
in a very different context.

01:15:33.402 --> 01:15:35.818
And it's hopefully because
you're talking about the things

01:15:35.818 --> 01:15:36.910
that you're excited about.

01:15:36.910 --> 01:15:41.770
And so I'm really happy with
how you've transformed, like,

01:15:41.770 --> 01:15:43.850
math, which is, again,
a very hard video

01:15:43.850 --> 01:15:48.269
to do if you don't do it
in the style of Vi Hart,

01:15:48.269 --> 01:15:49.810
and putting your
face and hosting it.

01:15:49.810 --> 01:15:51.560
It's done nicely.

01:15:51.560 --> 01:15:56.070
I think, in general, the video
has a very fast pace to it,

01:15:56.070 --> 01:15:59.380
and I don't know if it's
because the cuts are happening

01:15:59.380 --> 01:16:02.480
so frequently, or you're
naturally a very animated

01:16:02.480 --> 01:16:06.860
person, which is nice, but
leave a little bit of room,

01:16:06.860 --> 01:16:10.350
like, a little bit of breathing
space to compensate for that.

01:16:10.350 --> 01:16:13.280
I think maybe the reason
why it was hard for me

01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:15.800
to follow a little
bit was the opening

01:16:15.800 --> 01:16:18.310
seemed a little too short.

01:16:18.310 --> 01:16:20.970
And I know that you had edited
it from the last time I had

01:16:20.970 --> 01:16:22.836
seen it, but let's--

01:16:22.836 --> 01:16:23.502

01:16:34.564 --> 01:16:37.637

drawing a snowflake first.

01:16:37.637 --> 01:16:38.220
[END PLAYBACK]

01:16:38.220 --> 01:16:39.095
ELIZABETH CHOE: Yeah.

01:16:39.095 --> 01:16:41.620
It seems like it's
so overly condensed.

01:16:41.620 --> 01:16:44.930
And I know you had brought
it down from something that

01:16:44.930 --> 01:16:46.440
was a little bit
bigger, but I think

01:16:46.440 --> 01:16:49.880
that it's just so, like, it
comes out of nowhere, like, hi.

01:16:49.880 --> 01:16:51.335
What do these have in common?

01:16:51.335 --> 01:16:52.600
It's like, wait, what?

01:16:52.600 --> 01:16:54.740
Like, I wouldn't have
had that question.

01:16:54.740 --> 01:16:57.530
And even getting rid of
the hi helps with that.

01:16:57.530 --> 01:16:58.800
It's a nice question.

01:16:58.800 --> 01:17:03.660
What do snowflakes and cell
phone antennas have in common?

01:17:03.660 --> 01:17:06.550
But there's not enough
of a lead into you

01:17:06.550 --> 01:17:10.560
going into describing
what a fractal is, yet

01:17:10.560 --> 01:17:13.100
fractals is on the title.

01:17:13.100 --> 01:17:14.992
I think that maybe you
could do a little bit

01:17:14.992 --> 01:17:16.450
with the transition
there, and I'll

01:17:16.450 --> 01:17:18.680
brainstorm with you, because
I can't think of anything

01:17:18.680 --> 01:17:19.513
off the top my head.

01:17:19.513 --> 01:17:22.620
Do you guys have any
suggestions for that opening?

01:17:22.620 --> 01:17:23.760
Yeah, Andrea.

01:17:23.760 --> 01:17:27.030
AUDIENCE: Maybe like, I
don't know exactly how

01:17:27.030 --> 01:17:31.610
you could do it, but almost like
the first shot, where you're

01:17:31.610 --> 01:17:34.630
saying, what do snowflakes--
and then you see, like,

01:17:34.630 --> 01:17:37.447
sort of an image of a
snowflake and cell phones,

01:17:37.447 --> 01:17:39.030
and then it sort of
zooms out, and you

01:17:39.030 --> 01:17:42.564
realize that the picture
is on the cell phone.

01:17:42.564 --> 01:17:43.230
AUDIENCE: Maybe.

01:17:43.230 --> 01:17:46.100
AUDIENCE: Sort of
have in common.

01:17:46.100 --> 01:17:48.620
And then, you're-- and then you.

01:17:48.620 --> 01:17:50.120
ELIZABETH CHOE: I
mean, I think it's

01:17:50.120 --> 01:17:52.009
OK to introduce the
idea of fractals,

01:17:52.009 --> 01:17:53.800
as long as you set it
up a little bit more.

01:17:53.800 --> 01:17:56.300
So something like, what do
snowflakes and cell phones

01:17:56.300 --> 01:17:57.810
have in common?

01:17:57.810 --> 01:18:02.310
Neverending repeating
patterns called fractals.

01:18:02.310 --> 01:18:05.400
And then do a little bit
of a slower transition

01:18:05.400 --> 01:18:08.050
into you at the blackboard here.

01:18:08.050 --> 01:18:09.800
Something a little
bit more like that.

01:18:09.800 --> 01:18:12.130
I think the visuals help a lot.

01:18:12.130 --> 01:18:15.290
I know that you had filmed up
in Stata, because eventually you

01:18:15.290 --> 01:18:18.170
talk about how it
affects architecture,

01:18:18.170 --> 01:18:20.520
but I don't think that
this location is super

01:18:20.520 --> 01:18:22.750
vital to the
opening, and I think

01:18:22.750 --> 01:18:26.010
you can get cleaner
audio if you do VO,

01:18:26.010 --> 01:18:28.257
or if you just re-shoot
it with you on the table,

01:18:28.257 --> 01:18:30.590
and then you have a picture
of a snowflake that comes up

01:18:30.590 --> 01:18:34.680
in a picture of a cell phone,
or something like Andrea said.

01:18:34.680 --> 01:18:38.640
But I think having the audience
onboard from the get-go

01:18:38.640 --> 01:18:43.290
will help with the pacing of
the video as it continues.

01:18:43.290 --> 01:18:47.700
I know that you had
struggled with the music too,

01:18:47.700 --> 01:18:51.490
and I think-- I don't
know-- so much of music

01:18:51.490 --> 01:18:53.120
is personal taste.

01:18:53.120 --> 01:18:56.290
To me, all I can
think about when

01:18:56.290 --> 01:19:00.520
I hear this music is, like,
old Korean soap operas.

01:19:00.520 --> 01:19:02.860
And so I don't know
if it is, like,

01:19:02.860 --> 01:19:06.350
the most appropriate
tone, and maybe I

01:19:06.350 --> 01:19:10.040
feel that way because of
experiences of my parents

01:19:10.040 --> 01:19:14.260
watching them, but I think
you could play around

01:19:14.260 --> 01:19:15.230
with some other pieces.

01:19:15.230 --> 01:19:18.750
I like the general
tempo of the music,

01:19:18.750 --> 01:19:21.540
and how it's sort of
this same melody on loop

01:19:21.540 --> 01:19:24.040
in the background, so it's
not super distracting,

01:19:24.040 --> 01:19:25.020
and it's a good volume.

01:19:25.020 --> 01:19:27.690
But I would play around
with a couple other songs,

01:19:27.690 --> 01:19:29.750
and I can help you
with that, if you

01:19:29.750 --> 01:19:32.056
want to run some options by me.

01:19:32.056 --> 01:19:33.930
AUDIENCE: I wanted to
use this one because it

01:19:33.930 --> 01:19:39.000
was kind of calming, so kind of
to offset the general fast pace

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:40.985
and animated
talking to something

01:19:40.985 --> 01:19:42.110
soothing in the background.

01:19:42.110 --> 01:19:45.970
ELIZABETH CHOE: Yeah So I think
it's a good tone to start with,

01:19:45.970 --> 01:19:50.550
and again, maybe it's just
my personal preference,

01:19:50.550 --> 01:19:54.770
but something about it
made me fixate on the music

01:19:54.770 --> 01:19:56.450
more than on the text.

01:19:56.450 --> 01:19:58.040
Did anyone else
have-- maybe it really

01:19:58.040 --> 01:19:59.820
is, just, like I can't get
over how much it reminds

01:19:59.820 --> 01:20:01.020
me of Korean soap operas.

01:20:02.530 --> 01:20:04.440
AUDIENCE: It stood out
for me at the start,

01:20:04.440 --> 01:20:07.270
like, especially
for this scene, it

01:20:07.270 --> 01:20:11.770
gave me the feeling like it was
going to something romantic.

01:20:11.770 --> 01:20:12.947
I don't know.

01:20:12.947 --> 01:20:14.530
ELIZABETH CHOE: It's
very sentimental,

01:20:14.530 --> 01:20:17.390
like the music evokes
something very sentimental,

01:20:17.390 --> 01:20:21.510
just like the opening
of the ships one

01:20:21.510 --> 01:20:24.700
evokes a mood that's
very different from what

01:20:24.700 --> 01:20:25.700
you're about to go into.

01:20:25.700 --> 01:20:28.120
And especially if you open
with something like that,

01:20:28.120 --> 01:20:30.657
if you'd open with a banjo
thing-- or not the banjo--

01:20:30.657 --> 01:20:32.240
whatever you had for
the second piece,

01:20:32.240 --> 01:20:34.480
I think it would have been fine.

01:20:34.480 --> 01:20:36.180
But something about
opening with music

01:20:36.180 --> 01:20:38.550
that sets a tone that's very
different from what you're

01:20:38.550 --> 01:20:42.880
intending to achieve, it
threw me off a little bit.

01:20:42.880 --> 01:20:46.700
But luckily, it's something
that it's easily fixable.

01:20:46.700 --> 01:20:49.130
You can easily play around
with different types of music.

01:20:51.720 --> 01:20:54.660
AUDIENCE: Because
for me, you give us,

01:20:54.660 --> 01:20:56.495
because there was
a Digicom video,

01:20:56.495 --> 01:21:00.940
and there was the idea that you
could use something calming,

01:21:00.940 --> 01:21:03.470
so I tried to use
something calming,

01:21:03.470 --> 01:21:05.390
but as you see, I
didn't choose that,

01:21:05.390 --> 01:21:08.470
because I realized the
calming one will make

01:21:08.470 --> 01:21:12.320
my video feel very monotonous.

01:21:12.320 --> 01:21:16.530
But when I observe the
Digicom audio closer,

01:21:16.530 --> 01:21:19.490
I realized there was
some percussion notes,

01:21:19.490 --> 01:21:20.196
so that helped.

01:21:20.196 --> 01:21:21.570
So maybe you could
find something

01:21:21.570 --> 01:21:24.920
similar to what you have right
now, but with a little bit--

01:21:24.920 --> 01:21:31.282
not too much-- percussion here
would help with the pacing.

01:21:31.282 --> 01:21:32.740
ELIZABETH CHOE:
That's really good.

01:21:32.740 --> 01:21:36.424
And again, with music, there's
no hard and fast rules with

01:21:36.424 --> 01:21:37.590
what works and what doesn't.

01:21:37.590 --> 01:21:39.100
I mean, a lot of
it is just, like,

01:21:39.100 --> 01:21:42.340
your gut feeling when you
hear it, if it makes sense,

01:21:42.340 --> 01:21:44.780
or if it doesn't.

01:21:44.780 --> 01:21:47.244
And obviously, my gut feeling
was very different from

01:21:47.244 --> 01:21:47.910
everyone else's.

01:21:47.910 --> 01:21:49.542
Yeah, Jamie?

01:21:49.542 --> 01:21:53.218
AUDIENCE: First of all, compared
to where we started, this is

01:21:53.218 --> 01:21:54.562
isn't, like, oh my goodness.

01:21:54.562 --> 01:21:57.197
This is way, way more
awesome than I ever thought

01:21:57.197 --> 01:21:59.590
was possible, with
our first conversation

01:21:59.590 --> 01:22:02.330
about it's not real,
so this is like--

01:22:02.330 --> 01:22:05.134
and what I loved with the
fractal piece at the beginning,

01:22:05.134 --> 01:22:07.600
where you really explained,
because we gave you

01:22:07.600 --> 01:22:09.485
that feedback in
the last time, was

01:22:09.485 --> 01:22:12.319
you need to set us up for
success in explaining what

01:22:12.319 --> 01:22:13.819
a fractal actually
is, and I thought

01:22:13.819 --> 01:22:15.591
you did a really fantastic job.

01:22:15.591 --> 01:22:17.090
One think that you
may want to think

01:22:17.090 --> 01:22:22.030
about is you have a
very sing-songy voice.

01:22:22.030 --> 01:22:25.240
Your voice is high, and
it's kind of sing-songy.

01:22:25.240 --> 01:22:26.920
And at the beginning,
you set up this--

01:22:26.920 --> 01:22:28.920
I don't know if you've
ever seen Mrs. Doubtfire,

01:22:28.920 --> 01:22:31.810
but it's this movie where
Robin Williams is dressed up

01:22:31.810 --> 01:22:33.745
as this old
grandmother, and is just

01:22:33.745 --> 01:22:36.820
kind of this hilarious figure.

01:22:36.820 --> 01:22:39.235
And I think there's
an unintended humor

01:22:39.235 --> 01:22:42.135
to your sing-songy-ness
at the very beginning that

01:22:42.135 --> 01:22:45.637
makes me feel less credible
wanting to watch you.

01:22:45.637 --> 01:22:47.470
And I think there's a
very simple fix, which

01:22:47.470 --> 01:22:50.810
is just grounding your
voice in a lower register.

01:22:50.810 --> 01:22:53.455
When you talk with
your voice later on,

01:22:53.455 --> 01:22:55.865
just listen to that
as you watch yourself.

01:22:55.865 --> 01:22:59.980
I notice that the times when
your voice is a little lower

01:22:59.980 --> 01:23:03.885
is when I don't notice that
as much, and so since you are

01:23:03.885 --> 01:23:06.890
thinking of reworking
this first scene,

01:23:06.890 --> 01:23:09.355
you may want to think
about consciously grounding

01:23:09.355 --> 01:23:11.860
your voice a little
bit more in your chest,

01:23:11.860 --> 01:23:14.275
so that we don't,
like, unintentionally

01:23:14.275 --> 01:23:17.515
think it's funny when
it's not intended to be.

01:23:17.515 --> 01:23:18.890
ELIZABETH CHOE:
And I know George

01:23:18.890 --> 01:23:20.850
had said the camera
calms you down,

01:23:20.850 --> 01:23:23.990
and in general it does, and you
compensate with higher energy,

01:23:23.990 --> 01:23:26.769
but again, this is what I
saying before, and oftentimes,

01:23:26.769 --> 01:23:28.810
hopefully, this stuff that
we were saying earlier

01:23:28.810 --> 01:23:31.435
in the class makes a little more
sense after you guys have gone

01:23:31.435 --> 01:23:34.070
through it, but sometimes
the tendency is to compensate

01:23:34.070 --> 01:23:36.930
or equate higher energy
to higher pitch, higher

01:23:36.930 --> 01:23:40.390
volume, like, higher
everything, and it's really not

01:23:40.390 --> 01:23:40.910
that at all.

01:23:40.910 --> 01:23:42.330
A lot of it is just
the mentality of,

01:23:42.330 --> 01:23:44.538
like, I'm going to be really
present here, right now,

01:23:44.538 --> 01:23:46.600
and really give it 100% here.

01:23:46.600 --> 01:23:49.474
AUDIENCE: There's
actually a really good TED

01:23:49.474 --> 01:23:54.875
Talk that's about how to
speak to be listened to.

01:23:54.875 --> 01:23:59.300
And it's basically, you do
these little vocal exorcises,

01:23:59.300 --> 01:24:01.985
and they both relax
you, and they'll

01:24:01.985 --> 01:24:06.562
drop your register down,
like, just going through them.

01:24:06.562 --> 01:24:10.418
And I had to do those
prior to doing--

01:24:10.418 --> 01:24:13.212
I learned something
similar when I was first

01:24:13.212 --> 01:24:14.254
learning public speaking.

01:24:14.254 --> 01:24:15.670
ELIZABETH CHOE:
It's a great thing

01:24:15.670 --> 01:24:17.920
to think about not just
with making these videos,

01:24:17.920 --> 01:24:20.480
but when you're
giving talks later on.

01:24:20.480 --> 01:24:22.952
Again, like, when you're
nervous or excited,

01:24:22.952 --> 01:24:25.160
your tendency is to talk a
lot with your hands, which

01:24:25.160 --> 01:24:28.282
I know I do, and talk
really high pitched.

01:24:28.282 --> 01:24:30.490
So it's just a good thing
to think about, in general,

01:24:30.490 --> 01:24:31.380
after this class.

01:24:31.380 --> 01:24:32.325
AUDIENCE: Number two.

01:24:32.325 --> 01:24:34.283
AUDIENCE: At the beginning
of those voiceovers,

01:24:34.283 --> 01:24:37.660
I was trying to match
the video in my room.

01:24:37.660 --> 01:24:40.015
And it did feel a
little bit off as well.

01:24:40.015 --> 01:24:41.259
I wasn't sure how to--

01:24:41.259 --> 01:24:43.300
ELIZABETH CHOE: I think
you could do the opening,

01:24:43.300 --> 01:24:45.840
like, just you set up
a tripod, and sitting

01:24:45.840 --> 01:24:48.379
in your room or something,
just something really simple.

01:24:48.379 --> 01:24:49.920
What do this and
this have in common?

01:24:49.920 --> 01:24:52.680
Well, it's actually
neverending repeating

01:24:52.680 --> 01:24:56.550
patterns called fractals, and
then you go into fractals.

01:24:56.550 --> 01:24:58.050
AUDIENCE: On a very
practical level,

01:24:58.050 --> 01:25:00.814
like, I do a lot of helping
of people get ready for talks

01:25:00.814 --> 01:25:04.170
in my lab, and just, like,
grounding your feet wherever

01:25:04.170 --> 01:25:06.928
you are, feeling like you're
grounded to the earth,

01:25:06.928 --> 01:25:11.437
and then getting a really deep
breath, like way from in here

01:25:11.437 --> 01:25:14.450
before you speak, that will
help you fight that tendency

01:25:14.450 --> 01:25:15.860
to go way up high.

01:25:19.282 --> 01:25:21.240
ELIZABETH CHOE: And I
think the animations here

01:25:21.240 --> 01:25:22.690
will look really good.

01:25:22.690 --> 01:25:25.204
Again, like, visual
cues, anything

01:25:25.204 --> 01:25:27.620
that you're going to add, even
if it's just still pictures

01:25:27.620 --> 01:25:31.130
will make a big difference.

01:25:31.130 --> 01:25:34.480
And I would play around
with the ending too.

01:25:34.480 --> 01:25:38.170
I like that you do the review,
but again, the audio is hard

01:25:38.170 --> 01:25:41.330
when you're that far away.

01:25:41.330 --> 01:25:44.360
And you may be able to
shoot this in the same room

01:25:44.360 --> 01:25:46.900
that you shoot the opening
in-- or you re-shoot it,

01:25:46.900 --> 01:25:50.030
and then, I don't know,
have a picture of Stata

01:25:50.030 --> 01:25:51.180
just pop up next to you.

01:25:51.180 --> 01:25:54.050
I think that's a way to
compensate pretty easily.

01:25:54.050 --> 01:25:57.722
What is the world
background for?

01:25:57.722 --> 01:25:59.680
AUDIENCE: It matches the
world at the very end.

01:25:59.680 --> 01:26:00.305
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:26:00.305 --> 01:26:04.200
And it was just a nice
background for titles.

01:26:04.200 --> 01:26:05.060
ELIZABETH CHOE: Oh.

01:26:05.060 --> 01:26:07.060
I would just go black, honestly.

01:26:07.060 --> 01:26:08.590
Just a black background.

01:26:08.590 --> 01:26:14.182
In general, I think simple
reads more professional.

01:26:14.182 --> 01:26:14.950
Oh, I don't know.

01:26:14.950 --> 01:26:17.940
Professional's not the right
word, but simple is better,

01:26:17.940 --> 01:26:19.690
I think.

01:26:19.690 --> 01:26:22.366
And I didn't make the
connection of, like, look

01:26:22.366 --> 01:26:23.990
at the world when I
saw the background.

01:26:23.990 --> 01:26:25.380
It's such a minor thing, though.

01:26:25.380 --> 01:26:29.260
I mean, it's just your
credit, so it's OK,

01:26:29.260 --> 01:26:32.480
but just something
to think about.

01:26:32.480 --> 01:26:36.084
Any final comments for Yuliya?

01:26:36.084 --> 01:26:39.486
AUDIENCE: I thought that
one scene in the dorm

01:26:39.486 --> 01:26:42.402
was really good, where
you inadvertently

01:26:42.402 --> 01:26:44.215
had all the stuff behind us.

01:26:44.215 --> 01:26:46.540
I didn't know that it was
going to turn out like that.

01:26:46.540 --> 01:26:48.241
AUDIENCE: Oh, the
one in the lounge.

01:26:48.241 --> 01:26:48.865
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:26:48.865 --> 01:26:49.330
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:26:49.330 --> 01:26:51.450
And I think it was the best
lighting, too, of all of them.

01:26:51.450 --> 01:26:52.408
AUDIENCE: That's great.

01:26:56.737 --> 01:26:57.820
ELIZABETH CHOE: All right.

01:26:57.820 --> 01:26:59.403
So who's going to
comment on Yuliya's?

01:27:02.720 --> 01:27:06.650
AUDIENCE: PJ and Josh.

01:27:06.650 --> 01:27:07.840
ELIZABETH CHOE: All right.

01:27:07.840 --> 01:27:10.609
Last one, and then
we'll take a break.

01:27:10.609 --> 01:27:12.775
David, do you want to say
anything before we screen?

01:27:15.497 --> 01:27:17.080
Your video will just
speak for itself.

01:27:19.048 --> 01:27:21.016
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

01:27:21.016 --> 01:27:24.460
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:27:33.330 --> 01:27:35.430
-If I went out for a run
now, dressed like this,

01:27:35.430 --> 01:27:37.860
you'd probably call
me nuts, right?

01:27:37.860 --> 01:27:39.746
Because it's so
cold outside that

01:27:39.746 --> 01:27:42.125
I'd probably die of hypothermia.

01:27:42.125 --> 01:27:44.460
However, in 2009,
Wim Hof managed

01:27:44.460 --> 01:27:47.026
to run a full marathon in
minus 20 degrees Celsius,

01:27:47.026 --> 01:27:48.150
wearing nothing but shorts.

01:27:48.150 --> 01:27:53.270
While most people would probably
die, Wim Hof has survived.

01:27:53.270 --> 01:27:56.460
So what makes Wim Hof able to
survive where others can't?

01:27:56.460 --> 01:27:58.040
The research team
were suggesting

01:27:58.040 --> 01:28:01.687
that they subjected him to an
icy bath for almost two hours.

01:28:01.687 --> 01:28:04.020
While most people would have
their core body temperature

01:28:04.020 --> 01:28:07.117
drop to below 35 degrees,
causing hypothermia to kick in,

01:28:07.117 --> 01:28:08.533
Wim Hof's body
temperature dropped

01:28:08.533 --> 01:28:11.570
to a merely 37.4
degrees Celsius,

01:28:11.570 --> 01:28:13.210
staying surprisingly warm.

01:28:13.210 --> 01:28:15.500
And the funny thing is that
the researchers couldn't

01:28:15.500 --> 01:28:17.880
find exactly what had happened.

01:28:17.880 --> 01:28:20.379
Maybe it's his genetic
ancestry that saves him.

01:28:20.379 --> 01:28:21.920
In a sample study,
studies have found

01:28:21.920 --> 01:28:24.040
that individuals with
cold-climate ancestry,

01:28:24.040 --> 01:28:26.050
have been found to
have mitochodria

01:28:26.050 --> 01:28:28.560
that can produce more heat
and less chemical energy.

01:28:28.560 --> 01:28:30.615
Mitochondria is
like a mini-furnace

01:28:30.615 --> 01:28:33.200
that burns the sugars
from the food you eat

01:28:33.200 --> 01:28:35.440
into chemical and heat energy.

01:28:35.440 --> 01:28:38.052
Individuals like this are
better able to survive the cold,

01:28:38.052 --> 01:28:41.620
however, scientists haven't
fully studied Wim Hof's genome,

01:28:41.620 --> 01:28:44.030
so we don't really know.

01:28:44.030 --> 01:28:46.410
Wim Hof practices
g-tummo, a Tibetan form

01:28:46.410 --> 01:28:48.420
of meditation and
breathing, which allows

01:28:48.420 --> 01:28:50.062
him to double his metabolism.

01:28:50.062 --> 01:28:52.020
Remember those mitochondria
I mentioned before?

01:28:52.020 --> 01:28:54.980
Wim Hop can produce enough
heat through these mitochondria

01:28:54.980 --> 01:28:58.340
with special breathing, and
massive contractions that

01:28:58.340 --> 01:29:02.032
can produce enough
heat to body warm.

01:29:02.032 --> 01:29:03.990
Well, you might be tempted
to believe that this

01:29:03.990 --> 01:29:06.680
is wishy-washy nonsense.

01:29:06.680 --> 01:29:08.685
However, participants
in a study at NUS

01:29:08.685 --> 01:29:10.476
have been shown to
increase their core body

01:29:10.476 --> 01:29:14.290
temperature using g-tummo, and
they had no prior experience.

01:29:14.290 --> 01:29:15.595
Now, why is it so?

01:29:15.595 --> 01:29:17.470
Strong increases in
brain waves were noticed,

01:29:17.470 --> 01:29:19.855
and many have theorized
that this enables the body

01:29:19.855 --> 01:29:23.230
to effectively heat the center
as well as distribute it

01:29:23.230 --> 01:29:24.940
to the extremities.

01:29:24.940 --> 01:29:26.880
We do not fully understand
Wim Hof's methods.

01:29:26.880 --> 01:29:29.110
Although some have tried
to follow in his footsteps,

01:29:29.110 --> 01:29:31.710
you would be unwise
to do the same.

01:29:31.710 --> 01:29:34.030
And Wim Hof even claims
that he can control

01:29:34.030 --> 01:29:35.430
other parts of his body.

01:29:35.430 --> 01:29:38.130
Now, if this is true, and
scientifically a fact,

01:29:38.130 --> 01:29:39.780
who knows what doors could open.

01:29:39.780 --> 01:29:41.660
And since science hasn't
figured it out yet,

01:29:41.660 --> 01:29:43.820
and I, myself, don't
practice these methods,

01:29:43.820 --> 01:29:45.801
maybe I'd better be off
donning more jackets.

01:29:58.723 --> 01:30:00.220
[END PLAYBACK]

01:30:00.220 --> 01:30:02.470
ELIZABETH CHOE: David,
what was the hardest

01:30:02.470 --> 01:30:03.780
part about filming this video?

01:30:03.780 --> 01:30:05.979
AUDIENCE: I think it was
following the script.

01:30:05.979 --> 01:30:07.520
ELIZABETH CHOE:
Following the script.

01:30:07.520 --> 01:30:09.603
Just, like, remembering
it when you were shooting.

01:30:11.911 --> 01:30:12.536
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:30:12.536 --> 01:30:14.036
I really think that
was the hardest,

01:30:14.036 --> 01:30:17.496
because trying to say everything
while looking at a camera

01:30:17.496 --> 01:30:18.984
felt very, very real.

01:30:21.987 --> 01:30:22.820
ELIZABETH CHOE: Yep.

01:30:22.820 --> 01:30:24.010
That makes a lot of sense.

01:30:24.010 --> 01:30:27.380
And again, like, using
your partner to the fullest

01:30:27.380 --> 01:30:30.500
extent when you're
filming can really

01:30:30.500 --> 01:30:32.600
help with that
sort of humanizing

01:30:32.600 --> 01:30:35.590
the mechanical
element of production,

01:30:35.590 --> 01:30:38.110
trying to talk to the
person behind the camera.

01:30:38.110 --> 01:30:42.070
I think that you didn't look
uncomfortable on camera.

01:30:42.070 --> 01:30:46.040
The only thing is, in
general, you talk really fast,

01:30:46.040 --> 01:30:48.870
and with the music
that was in it,

01:30:48.870 --> 01:30:50.750
I think that you can
take some of the music

01:30:50.750 --> 01:30:53.710
out, or drop the volume a
ton, or play with, like,

01:30:53.710 --> 01:30:55.720
less busy music.

01:30:55.720 --> 01:30:59.210
But having someone who talks
naturally fast, and then, like,

01:30:59.210 --> 01:31:00.670
very upbeat music
in the background

01:31:00.670 --> 01:31:02.870
is just, like,
exacerbate, it's, like,

01:31:02.870 --> 01:31:04.940
constructive interference.

01:31:04.940 --> 01:31:10.220
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
calm music,

01:31:10.220 --> 01:31:14.540
but I felt like I
put calm music in.

01:31:14.540 --> 01:31:15.500
ELIZABETH CHOE: Yeah.

01:31:15.500 --> 01:31:19.450
I mean, you can also
experiment with not using music

01:31:19.450 --> 01:31:20.737
in certain parts of the video.

01:31:20.737 --> 01:31:23.070
You guys don't need to have
music the whole way through.

01:31:23.070 --> 01:31:24.150
It's OK.

01:31:24.150 --> 01:31:29.070
And I think because you
talk so fast naturally,

01:31:29.070 --> 01:31:33.270
the music can be-- remember,
with music, first do no harm,

01:31:33.270 --> 01:31:34.140
right?

01:31:34.140 --> 01:31:39.300
It can be hard to understand
just the sheer amount

01:31:39.300 --> 01:31:43.300
of content that you're
saying when the music is

01:31:43.300 --> 01:31:45.312
so upbeat and so loud.

01:31:45.312 --> 01:31:48.204
AUDIENCE: I think the music was,
at least for me, personally,

01:31:48.204 --> 01:31:51.096
it had the same effect as
when Elizabeth was showing

01:31:51.096 --> 01:31:53.640
the choices for the heart
video, where at the beginning,

01:31:53.640 --> 01:31:57.664
it was a little bit too much
for me, and I got the giggles.

01:31:57.664 --> 01:32:00.730
I don't know what about you
putting on running shoes,

01:32:00.730 --> 01:32:02.540
and, like, just the
loudness of that music,

01:32:02.540 --> 01:32:05.620
it just seemed a
little bit ridiculous,

01:32:05.620 --> 01:32:09.090
that I wasn't mentally
ready for some serious facts

01:32:09.090 --> 01:32:10.689
at that point.

01:32:10.689 --> 01:32:12.230
AUDIENCE: I wanted
to make it upbeat.

01:32:12.230 --> 01:32:15.974
I wanted it to be like I was
going to run in the cold.

[END PLAYBACK]

01:32:22.820 --> 01:32:24.745
AUDIENCE: It's good,
like, until the point

01:32:24.745 --> 01:32:27.782
where you ask the question.

01:32:27.782 --> 01:32:30.199
From, like, instead of being,
like, oh, OK, it's OK to be,

01:32:30.199 --> 01:32:32.282
like, oh, this is me when
I'm running in the cold.

01:32:32.282 --> 01:32:34.546
But then as soon as you
switch to actual explanation--

01:32:34.546 --> 01:32:35.420
ELIZABETH CHOE: Yeah.

01:32:35.420 --> 01:32:39.874
I would just duck it out
after you ask the question.

01:32:39.874 --> 01:32:42.160
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

01:32:42.160 --> 01:32:44.220
-If I went out for a run
now dressed like this,

01:32:44.220 --> 01:32:46.690
you'd probably call
me nuts, right?

01:32:46.690 --> 01:32:48.576
Because it's so
cold outside that

01:32:48.576 --> 01:32:50.340
I'd probably die of hypothermia.

01:32:50.960 --> 01:32:52.335
ELIZABETH CHOE:
And also there, I

01:32:52.335 --> 01:32:54.620
mean, everyone's done
this, where they take

01:32:54.620 --> 01:33:00.220
pauses in weird parts of
their sentences-- I mean,

01:33:00.220 --> 01:33:04.170
if you wanted to make it
funny, I don't know if you do.

01:33:04.170 --> 01:33:06.066
AUDIENCE: She's making--

01:33:06.066 --> 01:33:08.436
ELIZABETH CHOE: I am so sorry.

01:33:08.436 --> 01:33:10.810
AUDIENCE: I think it's one
of my favorite things--

01:33:10.810 --> 01:33:12.180
ELIZABETH CHOE: The last time
this happened, I was thinking,

01:33:12.180 --> 01:33:14.360
oh my gosh, this
happens to be more

01:33:14.360 --> 01:33:16.237
than I would like to
admit, but I was, like,

01:33:16.237 --> 01:33:18.070
I hope this doesn't
happen during the class,

01:33:18.070 --> 01:33:21.526
and it ends up on the internet,
but now it's going to anyway.

01:33:21.526 --> 01:33:24.202
[LAUGHTER]

01:33:30.030 --> 01:33:31.650
If you wanted to
make it funny, you

01:33:31.650 --> 01:33:36.610
could zoom in-- as
you-- nevermind.

01:33:36.610 --> 01:33:37.699
Don't make it funny.

01:33:37.699 --> 01:33:39.115
AUDIENCE: So if
you wanted-- I was

01:33:39.115 --> 01:33:42.731
going to say-- every time you
pause, cut out that pause,

01:33:42.731 --> 01:33:44.980
and then maybe a little bit
closer to your face, like,

01:33:44.980 --> 01:33:45.790
what if I die?

01:33:45.790 --> 01:33:47.280
And then, like,
zoom in, I'm cold.

01:33:50.400 --> 01:33:52.767
That's really comedic.

01:33:52.767 --> 01:33:55.100
ELIZABETH CHOE: It's kind of
like the thing that we did,

01:33:55.100 --> 01:33:58.450
and it's not very good,
like the extreme zoom,

01:33:58.450 --> 01:34:01.440
and you could make it,
like-- with comedy,

01:34:01.440 --> 01:34:03.912
going big or going home works
the best, because you really

01:34:03.912 --> 01:34:05.870
have to commit to it, so
if you want it to have

01:34:05.870 --> 01:34:07.830
a huge comedic effect,
you would, like,

01:34:07.830 --> 01:34:13.710
zoom in really close,
and you would have, like,

01:34:13.710 --> 01:34:16.948
a weird sound effect.

01:34:16.948 --> 01:34:19.840
I'm so sorry, you guys.

01:34:19.840 --> 01:34:22.859
AUDIENCE: I think it's
really funny to you.

01:34:22.859 --> 01:34:25.150
ELIZABETH CHOE: But if you
don't want to make it funny,

01:34:25.150 --> 01:34:33.710
which I would recommend, either
cut out the gaps and alternate

01:34:33.710 --> 01:34:36.520
between zooming in and out like
Hank Green does on SciShow.

01:34:36.520 --> 01:34:39.930
There's one other time that
happens, like, right here.

01:34:39.930 --> 01:34:43.310
In general, like, if
your gaps are happening

01:34:43.310 --> 01:34:47.790
in places that are not
at the ends of scenes,

01:34:47.790 --> 01:34:50.340
really be conscious of
how long those last.

01:34:50.340 --> 01:34:52.555
And having two other people
look at your video today

01:34:52.555 --> 01:34:53.930
will help, because
sometimes it's

01:34:53.930 --> 01:34:55.680
hard to tell when
you're watching yourself

01:34:55.680 --> 01:34:58.929
if something looks like it's
lasting too long or not.

01:34:58.929 --> 01:35:00.720
But if you have gaps
that are too long that

01:35:00.720 --> 01:35:02.095
are in the middle
of your scenes,

01:35:02.095 --> 01:35:04.910
you can use the trick
of digital zooming

01:35:04.910 --> 01:35:09.470
in and out to hide the cuts.

01:35:09.470 --> 01:35:13.490
Does anyone have
general comments?

01:35:13.490 --> 01:35:14.751
Yes, Yuliya.

01:35:14.751 --> 01:35:16.000
AUDIENCE: I like the delivery.

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.770
It was really natural.

01:35:18.770 --> 01:35:21.660
And the music was
sometimes distracting.

01:35:21.660 --> 01:35:23.824
Another thing that
had that effect

01:35:23.824 --> 01:35:26.240
were some of the backgrounds,
so like the one where you're

01:35:26.240 --> 01:35:28.280
holding a trashcan,
and there's a person,

01:35:28.280 --> 01:35:29.870
and then there's a trashcan.

01:35:29.870 --> 01:35:31.545
So I wasn't sure,
like, did that mean

01:35:31.545 --> 01:35:34.930
the person was in the
trashcan, like, what happened,

01:35:34.930 --> 01:35:38.970
and, like, yeah,
like, this scene.

01:35:38.970 --> 01:35:41.430
And then there were some
others, like the lab.

01:35:41.430 --> 01:35:46.700
I wasn't sure why
the lab was there.

01:35:46.700 --> 01:35:48.640
Even though it was really cool.

01:35:48.640 --> 01:35:49.580
ELIZABETH CHOE: I
know that you held up

01:35:49.580 --> 01:35:51.413
the trashcan because
you were trying to say,

01:35:51.413 --> 01:35:53.850
like, he was in a bucket.

01:35:53.850 --> 01:35:56.720
But again, with the music,
it's hard to hear that you're

01:35:56.720 --> 01:35:58.630
explaining the bucket
thing, so I would just

01:35:58.630 --> 01:36:01.915
cut to the picture of him
before you hold up the trashcan.

01:36:01.915 --> 01:36:02.640
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

01:36:02.640 --> 01:36:05.150
- --team were suggesting that
they subjected him to an icy

01:36:05.150 --> 01:36:06.000
bath for almost two hours.

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:06.260
[END PLAYBACK]

01:36:06.260 --> 01:36:07.245
ELIZABETH CHOE: Yeah.

01:36:07.245 --> 01:36:08.870
I mean, in general,
that line is spoken

01:36:08.870 --> 01:36:11.987
so quickly that it's hard
to follow what you're doing.

01:36:11.987 --> 01:36:13.570
AUDIENCE: And it's
not just the speed.

01:36:13.570 --> 01:36:15.444
I think you need to put
a little more diction

01:36:15.444 --> 01:36:19.730
in between your words, so that,
like, what I hear happening

01:36:19.730 --> 01:36:21.970
in they're kind of
slurring all together,

01:36:21.970 --> 01:36:23.570
so it's not just
a matter of speed,

01:36:23.570 --> 01:36:27.170
but it's that I'm having
trouble actually separating

01:36:27.170 --> 01:36:30.177
this word from this word,
and therefore, there

01:36:30.177 --> 01:36:32.010
are chunks that feel
like one big long word,

01:36:32.010 --> 01:36:35.220
that they're actually made
up of four or five words.

01:36:35.220 --> 01:36:38.430
I think there's a piece of
slowing down, but then also,

01:36:38.430 --> 01:36:41.010
forcing yourself to use
over-diction to clarify

01:36:41.010 --> 01:36:41.710
your words.

01:36:41.710 --> 01:36:44.970
That'll help a lot
too, more so than you

01:36:44.970 --> 01:36:49.689
think, because it will help
clean up those little spaces

01:36:49.689 --> 01:36:53.030
in between the words to then
provide me with a little more,

01:36:53.030 --> 01:36:56.414
like, OK, I'm with you every
single step of the way, if that

01:36:56.414 --> 01:36:57.310
makes sense.

01:36:57.310 --> 01:37:00.290
So if you are going to do
any retaking of videos,

01:37:00.290 --> 01:37:03.824
try really hard to
really tighten up the way

01:37:03.824 --> 01:37:05.282
that you say the
words, in addition

01:37:05.282 --> 01:37:06.728
to slowing down a little bit.

01:37:06.728 --> 01:37:07.919
I think that'll help people.

01:37:07.919 --> 01:37:10.335
ELIZABETH CHOE: I think if you
do that, that'll inherently

01:37:10.335 --> 01:37:12.420
help you slow down, because
you're going to think

01:37:12.420 --> 01:37:16.080
about each word at a time.

01:37:16.080 --> 01:37:18.085
I like the use of pictures here.

01:37:18.085 --> 01:37:19.460
It's really helpful,
because this

01:37:19.460 --> 01:37:21.540
is an instance where we
just don't have access

01:37:21.540 --> 01:37:23.210
to shoot any of this.

01:37:25.970 --> 01:37:29.360
I would play around with, in
general, zooming in and out,

01:37:29.360 --> 01:37:31.010
when you're doing long takes.

01:37:31.010 --> 01:37:32.850
I forgot to mention
this, but I thought

01:37:32.850 --> 01:37:35.730
that was a really nice thing
that Yuliya did in her video,

01:37:35.730 --> 01:37:39.454
was-- because we had talked
about this last week--

01:37:39.454 --> 01:37:40.870
how to clean up
some of the gaps--

01:37:40.870 --> 01:37:43.410
and she does some nice
work with cutting into,

01:37:43.410 --> 01:37:45.560
just like her hand
drawing the fractals,

01:37:45.560 --> 01:37:48.720
and I think that,
in general, people

01:37:48.720 --> 01:37:50.620
can take more advantage
of that technique.

01:37:54.810 --> 01:37:56.430
Oh.

01:37:56.430 --> 01:37:59.120
So here you're cutting
in between closeups,

01:37:59.120 --> 01:38:01.590
but this is another thing
with the iTrace, where

01:38:01.590 --> 01:38:04.840
in the first scene you're on the
left, and on the second scene,

01:38:04.840 --> 01:38:07.100
you're on the right,
and you're also not

01:38:07.100 --> 01:38:11.430
in the same 3D plane of
field as you were before.

01:38:11.430 --> 01:38:17.970
So in the previous scene,
you were close to the bench,

01:38:17.970 --> 01:38:19.660
and here, did you
scoot up forward?

01:38:22.900 --> 01:38:28.810
So it's not terrible-- it's
not like the end of the world

01:38:28.810 --> 01:38:31.020
or anything, but it's,
like, a little jarring,

01:38:31.020 --> 01:38:33.730
and I guess I'm
subconsciously taking time

01:38:33.730 --> 01:38:36.850
to adjust my sense
of space and where

01:38:36.850 --> 01:38:39.850
you are when that cut happens.

01:38:39.850 --> 01:38:42.380
I don't necessarily think
you have to re-shoot it,

01:38:42.380 --> 01:38:46.790
but I would either--
let's watch it.

01:38:46.790 --> 01:38:48.980
AUDIENCE: And they had
no prior experience.

01:38:48.980 --> 01:38:50.285
Now, why is it so?

01:38:50.285 --> 01:38:52.160
Strong increases in
brain waves were noticed,

01:38:52.160 --> 01:38:54.540
and many have theorized
that this enables the body

01:38:54.540 --> 01:38:57.700
to effectively heat the center
as well as distribute it

01:38:57.700 --> 01:38:59.465
to the extremities.

01:38:59.465 --> 01:39:00.840
ELIZABETH CHOE:
Is there a B-roll

01:39:00.840 --> 01:39:02.060
that you could use there?

01:39:02.060 --> 01:39:04.680
Because I think that's a really
good opportunity to-- it's

01:39:04.680 --> 01:39:07.470
a key point that
you're connecting

01:39:07.470 --> 01:39:09.180
what someone is doing
with their mind,

01:39:09.180 --> 01:39:10.910
and how that's
legitimately connecting

01:39:10.910 --> 01:39:12.070
to the rest of their body.

01:39:12.070 --> 01:39:12.986
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:39:17.307 --> 01:39:19.890
ELIZABETH CHOE: Could you even
just use pictures of the brain,

01:39:19.890 --> 01:39:21.181
and then, like, the human body?

01:39:24.040 --> 01:39:26.340
Again, this is a really
hard thing to visualize,

01:39:26.340 --> 01:39:30.530
and I know you're not working
with a ton of resources,

01:39:30.530 --> 01:39:32.060
but I think that's
an opportunity

01:39:32.060 --> 01:39:35.020
to maybe try voiceover
with the technique

01:39:35.020 --> 01:39:37.880
that Jamie was talking about,
because it's such a crucial bit

01:39:37.880 --> 01:39:39.070
to the video, actually.

01:39:39.070 --> 01:39:41.680
That's where you're
actually tying the science

01:39:41.680 --> 01:39:45.126
into something that seems
a little pseudo science.

01:39:45.126 --> 01:39:49.070
AUDIENCE: Keeping that in
mind, as you watch your video--

01:39:49.070 --> 01:39:52.028
and whoever's talking
over with you,

01:39:52.028 --> 01:39:54.164
really connecting
it and grounding it

01:39:54.164 --> 01:39:55.479
in the real science too.

01:39:55.479 --> 01:39:57.451
Because I liked your
furnace metaphor,

01:39:57.451 --> 01:40:00.902
but then I was distracted by
the burning exploding boxes,

01:40:00.902 --> 01:40:04.353
and if I've never heard
of mitochondria before,

01:40:04.353 --> 01:40:07.804
or cellular respiration
type things,

01:40:07.804 --> 01:40:09.810
that wouldn't be very distanced.

01:40:09.810 --> 01:40:12.305
I would think explosions
rather than this is grounded

01:40:12.305 --> 01:40:15.299
in my biology type things.

01:40:15.299 --> 01:40:16.962
And so maybe think
of places, where

01:40:16.962 --> 01:40:19.790
you can include images like
the circulatory system, things

01:40:19.790 --> 01:40:21.287
like that.

01:40:21.287 --> 01:40:23.283
Just, like, keep grounding it.

01:40:27.774 --> 01:40:32.265
AUDIENCE: When you cut from
the guy doing meditation

01:40:32.265 --> 01:40:35.758
to you sitting cross-legged,
was that purposeful?

01:40:35.758 --> 01:40:36.756
AUDIENCE: Yes.

01:40:36.756 --> 01:40:37.754
I'm supposed to be
doing meditation.

01:40:37.754 --> 01:40:38.253
AUDIENCE: OK.

01:40:38.253 --> 01:40:39.169
That's what I thought.

01:40:39.169 --> 01:40:43.540
Because I was like, not 100%
sure, but I was pretty sure

01:40:43.540 --> 01:40:46.325
that was a choice that you made.

01:40:46.325 --> 01:40:47.810
There's no comment.

01:40:47.810 --> 01:40:48.800
I just had a question.

01:40:52.866 --> 01:40:54.740
ELIZABETH CHOE: Any
other thoughts for David?

01:41:02.660 --> 01:41:05.810
So you guys want to do Google
Docs versus just talking one

01:41:05.810 --> 01:41:07.420
on one with people?

01:41:07.420 --> 01:41:10.180
Is that the consensus?

01:41:10.180 --> 01:41:11.860
AUDIENCE: Could we do both?

01:41:11.860 --> 01:41:12.180
ELIZABETH CHOE: Yeah.

01:41:12.180 --> 01:41:13.570
You can totally do both.

01:41:13.570 --> 01:41:17.600
So the rest of class time is
for feedback for each other,

01:41:17.600 --> 01:41:20.677
and this is a super, super
crucial, critical part

01:41:20.677 --> 01:41:21.760
of the production process.

01:41:24.510 --> 01:41:26.770
During the break,
I will post a link

01:41:26.770 --> 01:41:39.080
onto the Tumblr that has all
the Google Docs that I will

01:41:39.080 --> 01:41:40.270
finish making for everyone.

01:41:40.270 --> 01:41:44.530
So for example, Yuliya, your two
commenters are Joshua and PJ.

01:41:44.530 --> 01:41:47.850
So Josh and PJ, just go into
your corresponding page,

01:41:47.850 --> 01:41:49.870
and on the time code,
just leave your comments.

01:41:49.870 --> 01:41:52.062
I will comment on everyone's
rough cuts as well.

01:41:52.062 --> 01:41:54.520
And again, don't worry if you're
repeating the same remarks

01:41:54.520 --> 01:41:56.890
as other people are doing.

01:41:56.890 --> 01:42:00.580
How about we spend-- after the
break-- doing the Google Docs

01:42:00.580 --> 01:42:04.110
stuff, and then whenever
you guys finish,

01:42:04.110 --> 01:42:06.230
I guess, in the order
of people finishing,

01:42:06.230 --> 01:42:09.280
group up, and give one
on one feedback as well.

01:42:09.280 --> 01:42:11.302
And we can help
facilitate that too.

01:42:11.302 --> 01:42:14.920
Does that sound
good to everyone?

01:42:14.920 --> 01:42:16.440
The hardest part is over.

01:42:16.440 --> 01:42:19.370
The hardest part is just
getting the first cut.

01:42:19.370 --> 01:42:22.320
It's getting the first
script out there.

01:42:22.320 --> 01:42:26.640
And hopefully, moving
forward, going to Thursday,

01:42:26.640 --> 01:42:28.470
it'll be easier.
