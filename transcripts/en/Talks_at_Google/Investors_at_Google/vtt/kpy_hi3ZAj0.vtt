MALE SPEAKER: Welcome,
everyone, to our next episode

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:10.000
of value investing talks
in our series on investing.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.270
We have a very, very
special guest with us today.

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:15.010
He's traveled all the
way from New Delhi,

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:19.450
where he's a professor-- an
adjunct professor-- at MDI.

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:22.490
He teaches a very popular course
to the MBA students over there

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:27.020
which is titled Behavioral
Finance and Business Valuation.

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.410
He also blogs at
Fundoo Professor

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.950
and I've really enjoyed reading
some of his articles there.

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.990
So the nice thing
about Sunday is

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:41.690
that he's not only a teacher,
he's also a practitioner.

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.140
So in investing,
it's very interesting

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.850
when teaching and practice meet.

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.430
And we are really
looking forward

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.590
to learning from your insights
having worn both those hats.

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:58.350
And he's one of the few who eats
his own cooking and teaching

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.469
as you could say.

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:01.510
So without any further
ado, ladies and gentlemen,

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.760
please join me in
welcoming Sanjay Bakshi.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.092
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.230
SANJAY BAKSHI: Thank you,
Sarab for inviting me here.

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:13.355
It's a pleasure to be here.

00:01:13.355 --> 00:01:16.240
It's a wonderful campus and
I'm delighted to be here

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.010
with you today.

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:23.060
My talk is titled "The
Prejudices of Mr. Market."

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.690
But I would like to talk
to you, first, about

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.369
and an unusual subject
called empathy,

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:33.160
which is the ability
to step into the shoes

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:37.460
of another person aiming to
understand his or her feelings

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.640
and perspectives, and to
use that understanding

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.070
to guide our actions.

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:47.090
Empathy-- normally you
don't associate this word

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.200
with the world of
capitalism and investing.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.750
And I have to admit that I
used to take the same way too

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.430
when I started out as a value
investor about 21 years ago.

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.660
But today I think differently.

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.450
Today I think that every value
investor should count empathy

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.700
as one of the key tools
in his or her toolkit.

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.990
Today I use empathy
to really understand

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.190
a business and its
market valuation.

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.150
Let me explain how.

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.840
I'm a value investor
who focuses on investing

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.680
in moated businesses in
public markets in India.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.580
A moat, as you
know, is a metaphor

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.860
that Warren Buffett uses
to illustrate the idea

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.570
of a competitive advantage.

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.040
And in one of his
various talks, he

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.100
said that what we're
really trying to find

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.690
is a business that, for
one reason or another,

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.660
has this moat around it.

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.980
And you throw crocodiles and
sharks and piranhas in the moat

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.660
to make it harder
and harder for people

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.710
to swim across and
attack the castle.

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:51.010
So it's a very
powerful metaphor.

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.070
It's quite obvious
to me that investing

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.200
in a business with a moat
carries a very low risk

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.440
of permanent loss of capital.

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.290
A durable competitive
advantage makes a business

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.610
resilient to economic shocks
as well as managerial mistakes.

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:09.090
It gives the business what Tom
Russo, a wonderful investor who

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.760
I'm told is going to be
here and address you soon,

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.800
likes to call this
capacity to suffer.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.390
My own experience of more than
two decades of value investing

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.040
has persuaded me that investing
in a business with a moat

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.970
is likely to deliver much higher
returns with much lower risk

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.290
of permanent loss of capital
than investing in a business

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.140
without a moat.

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.560
I am also convinced that
buying into scalable businesses

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.480
with moats at sensible
prices and then

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.870
holding onto them for
long periods of time

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:42.190
is a very profitable,
low-stress investment strategy.

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.330
But what about empathy?

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:47.910
How do we use it for
analyzing moated businesses?

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:49.860
Well, while
evaluating a business

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.140
for a potential investor,
I try to empathize

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.180
with four types of people.

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.180
I try to step into
their shoes with an aim

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.660
to understand their
feelings and perspectives

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:02.980
and to use their understanding
to guide my firm's actions.

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.190
Who are these people?

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:07.120
Well, they're on
the screen here.

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.760
The first one, obviously,
is the customer.

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.060
I think it's terribly
important to understand well

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.930
about the pain of the customer
that a business alleviates.

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.065
Why does she prefer to
buy from the company

00:04:18.065 --> 00:04:19.760
that you're evaluating?

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.639
What's so special about
the value proposition

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:23.180
to customers that
will make them want

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.510
to come back again and again?

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:28.040
The second one is
the competitor.

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.520
Why would a
particular competitor

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.521
not enter this market?

00:04:31.521 --> 00:04:34.020
You really have to put yourself
in the shoes of a competitor

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:37.720
and try to enter the market
and see what will happen.

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.220
So there are two
kinds of situations

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:42.860
that I have encountered in
a moated situation-- one,

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.950
that there is a moat, and people
are going to try to enter,

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:48.420
and they're going to get
hurt, and they're not

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:49.359
going to try again.

00:04:49.359 --> 00:04:50.900
And the second one
is that they can't

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.840
enter because of some
regulatory reasons--

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.220
there is a patent,
for example, or there

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:56.445
is a regulatory monopoly.

00:05:00.174 --> 00:05:01.340
What are the entry barriers?

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:03.256
Essentially, this is all
about entry barriers.

00:05:03.256 --> 00:05:05.670
And I'm sure you're all very
familiar with all of that.

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:08.610
Put yourself in the shoes
of a potential competitor.

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:11.550
That's what it's all about.

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:14.040
The third person is
the entrepreneur.

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.130
What drives the entrepreneur?

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:21.610
Is he what Charlie Munger
calls an intelligent fanatic?

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:25.800
What struggles did he face in
making this business a success?

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.700
What would he do
during tough times?

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:30.760
What are his shortcomings?

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.910
Are they so strong that you
will reject partnering with him?

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:35.420
Why?

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:39.000
And finally, Mr. Market,
why is the stock market

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.720
misunderstanding this business?

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:42.940
What are its prejudices?

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:44.820
What will make them go away?

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:46.620
For the rest of
this talk, I will

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:48.960
focus on the fourth
person, Mr. Market.

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.800
The first three
are very obvious.

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.900
I think you all
know them very well.

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:55.400
Anybody who has studied
Porter knows about that.

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:57.520
But the fourth
person, Mr. Market, I

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:02.230
think it's something
worth knowing more about.

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:06.060
Many years ago Warren Buffett
called the stock market

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:08.370
the semi-psychotic
creature given to extremes

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:10.420
of elation and despair.

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:14.260
He was referring to the idea
that markets are sometimes very

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.770
inefficient in pricing assets.

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:19.090
In his classic book "The
Intelligent Investor,"

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:21.870
Ben Graham uses the
metaphor of Mr. Market,

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:25.450
which Warren Buffett has written
and spoken about many times.

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:28.700
And I quote, "Ben Graham,
my friend and teacher,

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:30.620
long ago described
the mental attitude

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:32.410
towards market fluctuations.

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:34.170
And I believe to be
the most conducive to

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:36.060
investment success.

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:38.580
He said that you should imagine
market quotations coming

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:41.000
from a remarkably
accommodating fellow named

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.110
Mr. Market who is your
partner in a private business.

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:46.590
Without fail, Mr. Market
appears daily and names

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:48.870
a price at which he will
either buy your interest

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:50.621
or sell you his.

00:06:50.621 --> 00:06:52.620
Even though the business
that the two of you own

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:54.203
may have economic
characteristics that

00:06:54.203 --> 00:06:57.050
are stable, Mr. Market's
quotations will be anything

00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:59.960
but, for, sad to
say, the poor fellow

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:02.500
has incurable
emotional problems."

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:05.520
"At times he feels euphoric and
can see only favorable factors

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:07.120
affecting the business.

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:10.890
When in that mood, he names
a very high buy/sell price

00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:13.230
because he fears that you
may snap up his interest

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:15.670
and rob him of imminent gains.

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:18.290
At other times he's depressed
and can see nothing but trouble

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:21.480
ahead for both the
business and the world.

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:24.140
On those occasions he
will name a very low price

00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:25.960
since he's terrified
that you will

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:28.290
unload your interest onto him."

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:31.100
"Mr. Market has another
endearing characteristic.

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:32.950
He doesn't mind being ignored.

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:35.470
If his quotation is
uninteresting to you today,

00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:37.950
he'll be back with
a new one tomorrow.

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:41.020
Transactions are
strictly at your option.

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:42.620
Under these conditions,
the more manic

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:45.130
depressive his behavior,
the better for you."

00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:47.770
"But like Cinderella
at the ball,

00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:50.400
you must heed one warning
or everything will

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:53.060
turn into pumpkin and mice.

00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:57.700
Mr. Market is there to serve
you and not to guide you.

00:07:57.700 --> 00:07:59.630
It is his pocketbook,
not his wisdom,

00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:01.320
that you will find useful.

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:04.240
If he shows up some day in
a particularly foolish mood,

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:07.110
you're free to either ignore
him or take advantage of him.

00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:08.660
But it'll be
disastrous if you were

00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:10.730
to fall under his influence."

00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:13.520
I think every potential value
investor or value investing

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:15.610
student has read
this many times.

00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:17.790
So it appears that
Mr. Market really

00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:19.470
is what Warren
Buffett has called

00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:22.080
"a semi-psychotic
creature given to extremes

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:25.350
of elation and despair."

00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:27.610
Yes, he is utterly
irrational sometimes.

00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:29.840
And whenever that
happens, value investors

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:32.690
are going to take advantage
of his prejudices.

00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:37.690
But here's the thing-- if Mr.
Market is irrational and stays

00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:41.840
that way, then how will value
investors make any money?

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:43.559
For them to make
money, Mr. Market

00:08:43.559 --> 00:08:47.330
should misprice assets
only temporarily.

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:49.290
And that is exactly
what Ben Graham

00:08:49.290 --> 00:08:51.170
meant when he said
that "in the short run,

00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:55.230
the market is a voting machine
reflecting a voter registration

00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:57.410
test that requires only
money, not intelligence

00:08:57.410 --> 00:08:58.460
or emotional stability.

00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:03.070
But in the long run, the market
is like a weighing machine."

00:09:03.070 --> 00:09:05.360
Therein lies our opportunity.

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:08.075
Once we know, one, that
the stock market has

00:09:08.075 --> 00:09:10.022
a tendency of becoming
extremely prejudiced

00:09:10.022 --> 00:09:11.730
against some business
which, in our view,

00:09:11.730 --> 00:09:15.140
is exceptionally good,
two, such prejudices

00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:18.460
produce very attractive market
valuations for that business,

00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:20.370
and three, the
market, however, tends

00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:23.160
in tendency of correcting
its prejudice over time,

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:26.670
we can really understand how to
make intelligent investments.

00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:28.860
If we can understand why
the market is prejudiced

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:30.620
against a business
we love and what

00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:32.470
will make those
prejudices go away,

00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:35.660
then we'll have a basis for
betting against the market.

00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:37.700
That is exactly
what Seth Klarman

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:40.870
meant when he wrote about the
idea of necessary arrogance.

00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:45.610
He said that "at
the root of value

00:09:45.610 --> 00:09:48.799
investing is the belief,
first espoused by Ben Graham,

00:09:48.799 --> 00:09:50.590
that the market is a
voting machine and not

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:53.290
a weighing machine.

00:09:53.290 --> 00:09:55.600
Thus an investor must
have more confidence

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:58.380
in his or her own opinion
than in the combined

00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:00.140
weight of all other opinions.

00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:03.730
This borders on arrogance,
the necessary arrogance

00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:06.440
that is required to make
investment decisions."

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:10.220
"This arrogance must be tempered
with extreme caution giving

00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:13.700
due respect to the opinions
of others, many of whom

00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:15.730
are very intelligent
and hard-working.

00:10:15.730 --> 00:10:19.040
Their sale of shares to you
at seeming bargain prices

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:21.020
may be the result of
ignorance, emotion,

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:23.410
or various institutional
constraints.

00:10:23.410 --> 00:10:28.660
Or it may be that the apparent
bargain is, in fact, flawed,

00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:31.420
that it is actually fairly
priced or even overvalued

00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:33.970
and that sellers know
more than you do."

00:10:33.970 --> 00:10:37.350
"This is a serious risk, but one
that can be mitigated, first,

00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:40.190
by extensive fundamental
analysis, and second,

00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:42.320
by knowing not
only that something

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:47.980
is bargain priced but, as best
as you can, also why it is so.

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:50.620
You never know for certain
why sellers are getting out,

00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:53.170
but you may be able
to reasonably surmise

00:10:53.170 --> 00:10:54.900
a rationale."

00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:58.000
I think Klarman has made a
very important point here

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.410
about the need to know the
prejudices of Mr. Market.

00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:03.540
And many of those
prejudices arise out

00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:10.460
of a shortcut called a
representativeness heuristic,

00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:12.690
which means that we look
for similar past experiences

00:11:12.690 --> 00:11:16.290
to make judgments about the
probability of future events.

00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:19.560
So for example, if you run
an insurance operation,

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:21.490
you would have vast
amounts of customer data

00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:23.650
that allows you to determine
future likely behavior

00:11:23.650 --> 00:11:25.750
of a potential
buyer of insurance.

00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:27.519
You would determine
that probability

00:11:27.519 --> 00:11:29.560
and accordingly determine
the insurance quotation

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:32.170
based on categories.

00:11:32.170 --> 00:11:35.150
You will create these
categories in your database.

00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:37.850
A potential buyer of insurance
might, in your judgment,

00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:40.080
belong to a high risk
category because he's

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:43.050
a male, 20-year-old,
young, alcohol-consuming,

00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:46.840
college-going student who
has never owned a car before.

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:49.620
For such a buyer, your quotation
for selling car insurance

00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:54.060
would be higher than that of
a low-risk category individual

00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:58.289
comprising of, say, a
35-year-old woman, a mother

00:11:58.289 --> 00:12:00.580
of two children who has never
had an accident in her 10

00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:03.560
years of car driving experience.

00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:08.120
Such type of categorization
or stereotyping

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:12.170
is essential for making quick
judgments in any domain.

00:12:12.170 --> 00:12:13.940
Indeed, the very
word "stereotyping"

00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:17.170
has an unnecessary
negative connotation.

00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:20.590
In Daniel Kahneman's book,
"Thinking, Fast and Slow,"

00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:24.370
he writes, "'Stereotyping'
is a bad word in our culture,

00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:27.410
but in my usage it is neutral.

00:12:27.410 --> 00:12:30.280
One of the basic
characteristics of System 1

00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:32.550
is that it represents
categories as norms

00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:35.280
and prototypical exemplars."

00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:37.760
"This is how we think of
horses, refrigerators,

00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:39.770
and New York police officers.

00:12:39.770 --> 00:12:41.490
We hold in memory
a representation

00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:45.780
of one or more normal members
of each of these categories.

00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:48.060
When the categories are
social, these representations

00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:49.810
are called stereotypes."

00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:53.710
"Some stereotypes are
perniciously wrong

00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:57.840
and hostile stereotyping can
have dreadful consequences.

00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:00.680
But psychological facts
cannot be avoided.

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:02.420
Stereotypes, both
correct and false,

00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:05.130
are how we think of categories."

00:13:05.130 --> 00:13:09.180
When Kahneman writes that some
stereotypes are perniciously

00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:11.580
wrong, he's referring
to such stereotyping

00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:14.260
as a key source of prejudice.

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:18.290
In his wonderful book, "Mistakes
Were Made (But Not by Me),"

00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:23.360
the psychologist Elliot
Aronson writes, "Prejudices

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:26.670
emerge from the disposition
of the human mind

00:13:26.670 --> 00:13:29.690
to perceive and process
information in categories.

00:13:29.690 --> 00:13:33.030
Categories is a nicer, more
neutral word than stereotypes,

00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:34.840
but it is the same thing.

00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:36.760
Stereotypes are
energy-saving devices

00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:38.680
that allow us to make
efficient decisions

00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:41.830
on the basis of past
experience, help us quickly

00:13:41.830 --> 00:13:44.870
process new information and
retrieve memories, make sense

00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:47.110
of real differences
between groups,

00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:49.310
and predict, often with
considerable accuracy,

00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:52.090
how others will behave
or how they think.

00:13:52.090 --> 00:13:55.650
We wisely rely on stereotypes
and the quick information

00:13:55.650 --> 00:13:59.900
they give us to avoid danger,
approach possible new friends,

00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:02.210
choose one school
or job over another,

00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:05.000
or decide that the person
across the crowded room

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.400
will be the love of our lives."

00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:10.460
But when Kahneman also writes
that hostile stereotyping can

00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:13.340
have dreadful
consequences, he is really

00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:15.830
referring to sensitive
social contexts

00:14:15.830 --> 00:14:18.420
such as hiring and
racial profiling

00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:21.280
by, say, immigration
authorities.

00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:24.300
He's not referring to
the world of investing.

00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:26.790
In the world of investing,
hostile stereotyping

00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:29.490
by Mr. Market can have
wonderful consequences

00:14:29.490 --> 00:14:32.100
for the value investors.

00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:34.940
Take the case of the
airline industry.

00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:37.750
Anyone who has read
Warren Buffett's letters

00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:40.060
or watched his
interviews on the subject

00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:44.380
knows just how bad the economics
of the airline industry are.

00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:45.720
WARREN BUFFET: Yeah.

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:48.640
MALE SPEAKER: Mr.
Buffett, what prompted

00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:51.240
you to make an investment in
US Air given the fact that this

00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:53.790
is such a cutthroat
industry and certainly

00:14:53.790 --> 00:14:56.670
not transparent and
easily understandable?

00:14:56.670 --> 00:14:59.170
WARREN BUFFET: Well, I think
that, probably, the best answer

00:14:59.170 --> 00:15:00.460
is temporary insanity.

00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:02.316
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:06.690
The fellow that runs US
Air is a wonderful guy,

00:15:06.690 --> 00:15:10.590
but he just happens to be in an
extraordinarily tough business.

00:15:10.590 --> 00:15:13.550
And the interesting
thing is I had actually

00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:15.892
written something for Graham's
book, in the early '70s,

00:15:15.892 --> 00:15:18.100
about how the airline business
was about the toughest

00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:19.451
business there was.

00:15:19.451 --> 00:15:21.200
And the interesting
thing of your question

00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:22.910
is that if you'd go
back to the time--

00:15:22.910 --> 00:15:24.535
and we're in the
right state for that--

00:15:24.535 --> 00:15:27.290
if we go back to the
time of Kitty Hawk, net,

00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:30.070
the airline transport
business in the United States

00:15:30.070 --> 00:15:31.165
has made no money.

00:15:31.165 --> 00:15:33.540
I mean, just think if you'd
been down there in Kitty Hawk

00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:34.790
and you'd seen this guy go up.

00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:38.610
And all of a sudden this vision
hits you that tens of millions

00:15:38.610 --> 00:15:41.000
of people would be doing this
all over the world some day

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.490
and it would bring us all
closer together and everything.

00:15:42.490 --> 00:15:45.290
And you'd think, my god, this
is something to be in on.

00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:49.150
And despite putting in billions
and billions and billions

00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:51.599
of dollars, the net
return to owners

00:15:51.599 --> 00:15:53.765
from being in the entire
airline industry-- if you'd

00:15:53.765 --> 00:15:55.750
owned it all and you'd
put up all this money--

00:15:55.750 --> 00:15:56.890
is less than zero.

00:15:56.890 --> 00:15:58.640
If there had been a
capitalist down there,

00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:01.098
the guy should have shot down
Wilbur, you know what I mean?

00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:07.900
One small step for
mankind and one huge step

00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:09.020
backwards for capitalism.

00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:15.540
But anyway, so along comes 1989
and I've got a lot of cash.

00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:19.030
And no one misled me in
any way, shape or form.

00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:21.250
This is 100% my decision.

00:16:21.250 --> 00:16:24.350
And I put money in it.

00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:28.230
And Seth Schofield-- you can't
find a better human being

00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:29.810
or manager than Seth Schofield.

00:16:29.810 --> 00:16:34.600
But he is operating
with revenues

00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:36.830
based on market factors
and costs that are not

00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:37.910
based on market factors.

00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:41.470
And that's a recipe
for a lot of trouble.

00:16:41.470 --> 00:16:42.570
So I now have this--

00:16:42.570 --> 00:16:43.590
SANJAY BAKSHI: I'll pause
there, for the video.

00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:44.310
WARREN BUFFET: --800 number.

00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:45.460
And if I ever get the urge
to buy an airline stock--

00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:45.690
SANJAY BAKSHI:
Buffett is obviously

00:16:45.690 --> 00:16:46.320
talking about the insensitivity
towards base rates.

00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:47.900
WARREN BUFFET: --I
dial this number.

00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:49.810
And I say, my name is Warren
and I'm an "airoholic."

00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:51.240
And then this guy talks
me down on the other end.

00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:51.450
SANJAY BAKSHI: He is telling
us that before we invest

00:16:51.450 --> 00:16:53.241
in the airline industry,
we should be aware

00:16:53.241 --> 00:16:56.135
that the odds of making money
in that industry are bleak.

00:16:56.135 --> 00:16:58.260
That's because the overall
economics of the airline

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:00.040
industry suck.

00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:02.110
But that does not
have to mean that we

00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:06.244
put every airline in the crappy
business category in our mind.

00:17:06.244 --> 00:17:07.619
If we do that,
then we will never

00:17:07.619 --> 00:17:10.264
invest in a Ryanair or
a Southwest Airline,

00:17:10.264 --> 00:17:11.930
both of which are
solid businesses which

00:17:11.930 --> 00:17:14.210
have beaten market
indices handsomely

00:17:14.210 --> 00:17:17.619
over the last several years.

00:17:17.619 --> 00:17:20.339
Perhaps the analyst who did
invest in either of these two

00:17:20.339 --> 00:17:22.579
businesses thought
differently from the market

00:17:22.579 --> 00:17:24.020
without falling
for the prejudice

00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:27.339
of applying the crappy
business label to them.

00:17:27.339 --> 00:17:30.330
Perhaps she dug deeper and
found that both businesses

00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:32.550
had durable
competitive advantages

00:17:32.550 --> 00:17:35.170
and were run by entrepreneurs
whom Charlie Munger would

00:17:35.170 --> 00:17:36.940
call intelligent fanatics.

00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:40.440
Perhaps she had reliable and
persuasive evidence specific

00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:42.350
to those businesses
which would go

00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:44.660
against the conclusion
in the base rate

00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:46.850
that airlines are
crappy businesses.

00:17:46.850 --> 00:17:48.760
Perhaps they were
exceptional businesses

00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:50.580
which defied the rule.

00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:53.140
Perhaps she had the necessary
arrogance based on the fact

00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:56.910
that she was right and
Mr. Market was wrong.

00:17:56.910 --> 00:18:01.620
Exactly this type of thinking
produces exceptional returns.

00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:03.320
When Mr. Market is
deeply prejudiced

00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:06.090
against what you know to
be a wonderful business,

00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:09.420
that very prejudice creates
a fabulous investment

00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:12.000
opportunity.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.850
And so let's empathize
with Mr. Market

00:18:13.850 --> 00:18:15.850
and understand its
prejudices in the pricing

00:18:15.850 --> 00:18:17.660
of moated businesses.

00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:21.560
But before I do that I want
to say some words of caution.

00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:26.180
First, these are the prejudice
that I have found and exploited

00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:28.430
over the years, which means
that there may be others

00:18:28.430 --> 00:18:30.490
which I have not found yet.

00:18:30.490 --> 00:18:33.260
Second, I only to
prejudices in the pricing

00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:34.769
of moated businesses.

00:18:34.769 --> 00:18:36.310
To be sure, there
are many other ways

00:18:36.310 --> 00:18:37.630
of practicing value investing.

00:18:37.630 --> 00:18:41.420
And the other kinds
of value investing

00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:46.679
may result in your exploiting
opportunities, prejudices which

00:18:46.679 --> 00:18:48.220
are very different
from the one which

00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:50.100
I'm going to site right now.

00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:52.950
Finally, there will be
overlaps in the sense

00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:55.250
that, sometimes, you will
find multiple prejudices

00:18:55.250 --> 00:18:56.680
in a single situation.

00:18:56.680 --> 00:19:00.130
And when that happens, you
can expect what Charlie Munger

00:19:00.130 --> 00:19:04.180
calls a lollapalooza outcome.

00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:08.800
My first prejudice is
titled "Marshmallows."

00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:11.040
Here I want to talk about
the tendency of investors

00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:12.950
to categorize
stocks of businesses

00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:17.540
as cheap or expensive based on
their reported P/E multiples.

00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:20.387
For example, many of my
own value investing friends

00:19:20.387 --> 00:19:22.220
wouldn't want to buy
into a business selling

00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:24.610
at a P/E multiple of 25.

00:19:24.610 --> 00:19:27.820
That's a prejudice in my
view for two big reasons.

00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:29.800
First, there's
plenty of evidence

00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:31.550
which disconfirms the
notion that business

00:19:31.550 --> 00:19:35.650
selling at P/E multiples of
25 or above are expensive.

00:19:35.650 --> 00:19:37.960
By definition, a business
that's expensive,

00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:40.150
if purchased at that
expensive price,

00:19:40.150 --> 00:19:43.761
should deliver poor investment
returns over the long term.

00:19:43.761 --> 00:19:45.260
But there's plenty
of research which

00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:47.610
shows that's not the case.

00:19:47.610 --> 00:19:52.060
While the average business
may well be overpriced at 25x,

00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:54.320
that doesn't mean that
exceptional ones are also

00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:57.710
expensive at that
market valuation.

00:19:57.710 --> 00:20:00.040
Charlie Munger's observation
that "if a business earns

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:03.270
18% on capital over
20 or 30 years,

00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:05.180
even if you pay an
expensive looking price,

00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:07.440
you'll end up with
one hell of a result"

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:10.710
is obviously
applicable over here.

00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:13.620
And the second reason is
that, in a moated business,

00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:15.782
reported earnings
often understate

00:20:15.782 --> 00:20:16.740
true economic earnings.

00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:23.490
That's because money spent
on successful moat expansion

00:20:23.490 --> 00:20:25.571
activities is
charged off to P&amp;L.

00:20:25.571 --> 00:20:27.320
But it should be treated
as an expenditure

00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:30.310
with benefit spanning
more than a year.

00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:33.034
This is a key point that
Buffett has made in his letters

00:20:33.034 --> 00:20:35.200
and which, in my view, is
often not fully understood

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:36.720
by investors.

00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:39.550
Charlie Munger's observation
that almost all good businesses

00:20:39.550 --> 00:20:43.400
engage in paying today, gain
tomorrow activities also

00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:46.130
means that after making
the necessary adjustments,

00:20:46.130 --> 00:20:49.350
one would find that the multiple
of their economic earnings--

00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:51.640
the ones that really
matter-- are sometimes

00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:53.410
significantly lower
than P/E multiples

00:20:53.410 --> 00:20:55.180
based on reported earnings.

00:20:55.180 --> 00:20:58.510
And so what looks
optically expensive

00:20:58.510 --> 00:21:00.870
is really not that expensive.

00:21:00.870 --> 00:21:02.350
In my view, the
market's tendency

00:21:02.350 --> 00:21:04.640
to categorize a
business as expensive

00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:07.200
simply because it's
trading at a 25 multiple

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:09.500
is an inexplicable prejudice.

00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:11.180
Warren Buffett agrees.

00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:13.840
He wrote, many years ago, that
the term "value investing"

00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:16.450
typically connotes the
"purchase of stocks

00:21:16.450 --> 00:21:19.020
having attributes such
as low ratio of price

00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:21.665
to book value, price to earnings
ratio at a high dividend

00:21:21.665 --> 00:21:22.720
yield."

00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:24.610
Unfortunately, such
characteristics,

00:21:24.610 --> 00:21:26.480
even if they appear
in combination,

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:29.330
are far from determinative as
to whether an investor is indeed

00:21:29.330 --> 00:21:32.060
buying something
for what it is worth

00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:34.980
and is therefore truly
operating on the principles

00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:37.380
for obtaining value
in his investments.

00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:39.640
Correspondingly opposite
characteristics--

00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:43.200
a high ratio of price to book
value, a high price/earnings

00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:45.720
ratio, and a low
dividend yield--

00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:51.290
are in now way inconsistent
with a value purchase.

00:21:51.290 --> 00:21:53.230
At this point you
must be wondering,

00:21:53.230 --> 00:21:56.960
why did I title this part of
the talk as "marshmallows."

00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:59.620
The answer to that question lies
in a famous experiment which

00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:02.190
I'm sure many of
you have heard of,

00:22:02.190 --> 00:22:03.650
the famous
marshmallow experiment

00:22:03.650 --> 00:22:07.270
conducted in the neighborhood
in Stanford University.

00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:12.089
This experiment is beautifully
described in this video.

00:22:12.089 --> 00:22:13.630
JOACHIM DE POSADA:
I'm here because I

00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:15.360
have a very important message.

00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:20.750
I think we have found the most
important factor for success.

00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:24.710
And it was found close
to here, at Stanford.

00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:29.255
A psychology professor took
kids that were four years old

00:22:29.255 --> 00:22:32.980
and put them in a room
all by themselves.

00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:37.070
And he would tell the child,
a four-year-old kid, Johnny,

00:22:37.070 --> 00:22:41.530
I want to leave you here with
a marshmallow for 15 minutes.

00:22:41.530 --> 00:22:44.930
If, after I come back,
this marshmallow is here,

00:22:44.930 --> 00:22:47.230
you will get another one.

00:22:47.230 --> 00:22:49.260
So you will have two.

00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:53.000
To tell a four-year-old kid to
wait 15 minutes for something

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:56.020
that they like is
equivalent to telling us,

00:22:56.020 --> 00:23:01.501
we'll bring you coffee in two
hours, exactly equivalent.

00:23:01.501 --> 00:23:06.100
So what happened when the
professor left the room?

00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:09.960
As soon as the door
closed-- [SWISH]--

00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:12.310
two out of three
ate the marshmallow.

00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:15.130
Five seconds, 10 seconds,
40 seconds, 50 seconds,

00:23:15.130 --> 00:23:17.370
two minutes, four
minutes, eight minutes--

00:23:17.370 --> 00:23:20.690
some lasted 14.5 minutes--
[SWISH] [CHOMP]--

00:23:20.690 --> 00:23:25.330
couldn't do it, could not wait.

00:23:25.330 --> 00:23:28.012
What's interesting is
that one out of three

00:23:28.012 --> 00:23:29.970
would look at the
marshmallow and go like this.

00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:37.080
Would look at it, put it back.

00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:38.590
They would walk around.

00:23:38.590 --> 00:23:41.790
They would play with
their skirts and pants.

00:23:41.790 --> 00:23:45.150
That child already,
at four, understood

00:23:45.150 --> 00:23:49.710
the most important principle for
success, which is the ability

00:23:49.710 --> 00:23:54.500
to delay gratification,
self-discipline,

00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:57.010
the most important
factor for success.

00:23:57.010 --> 00:24:02.220
15 years later-- 14, 15 years
later-- follow-up study.

00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:04.150
What did they find?

00:24:04.150 --> 00:24:06.930
They went to look for these
kids who were now 18 and 19.

00:24:06.930 --> 00:24:10.830
And they found that 100%
of the children that

00:24:10.830 --> 00:24:13.994
had not eaten the
marshmallow were successful.

00:24:13.994 --> 00:24:14.910
They have good grades.

00:24:14.910 --> 00:24:16.420
They were doing wonderful.

00:24:16.420 --> 00:24:17.480
They were happy.

00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:18.546
They had their plans.

00:24:18.546 --> 00:24:20.920
They have good relationships
with the teachers, students.

00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:22.280
They were doing fine.

00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:25.214
A great percentage of the
kids that ate the marshmallow,

00:24:25.214 --> 00:24:26.130
there were in trouble.

00:24:26.130 --> 00:24:28.020
They did not make it
to the university.

00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:29.180
They have bad grades.

00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:30.320
Some of them dropped out.

00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:32.890
A few were still--

00:24:32.890 --> 00:24:34.820
SANJAY BAKSHI: Why did
most kids not wait?

00:24:34.820 --> 00:24:36.290
Two out of three
kids didn't wait.

00:24:36.290 --> 00:24:37.810
Well, if you think
about it, they

00:24:37.810 --> 00:24:42.165
were implicitly using
DCF, discounted cash flow,

00:24:42.165 --> 00:24:43.040
to make their choice.

00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:45.420
The kid who could not
wait for 15 minutes

00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:47.900
for another marshmallow was
implicitly, at the subconscious

00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:50.110
level, using a very
high discount rate

00:24:50.110 --> 00:24:53.480
to determine the present value
of the second marshmallow.

00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:56.310
To her, two marshmallows
15 minutes later

00:24:56.310 --> 00:24:59.372
were not worth as much
as one marshmallow now.

00:24:59.372 --> 00:25:00.830
And the only way
that can happen is

00:25:00.830 --> 00:25:04.330
if she was using a very
high discount rate.

00:25:04.330 --> 00:25:06.680
If kids can be
myopic and over-weigh

00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:08.750
instant gratification
and under-weigh

00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:12.560
delayed gratification,
why not Mr. Market?

00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:16.330
Indeed, Buffett offers clues as
to how he thinks about discount

00:25:16.330 --> 00:25:17.890
rates for valuing a business.

00:25:21.090 --> 00:25:23.630
He says, "When we look at
the future of a business,

00:25:23.630 --> 00:25:28.280
we look at riskiness as
a sort of go/no-go valve.

00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:30.240
In other words, if we
think that we simply

00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:32.240
don't know what's going
to happen in the future,

00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:34.010
that doesn't mean it's
risky for everyone.

00:25:34.010 --> 00:25:37.620
It means we don't know
and it's risky for us."

00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:39.270
"It may not be risky
for someone else

00:25:39.270 --> 00:25:40.500
who understand the business.

00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:42.609
However, in this
case, we just give up.

00:25:42.609 --> 00:25:44.150
We don't try to
predict those things.

00:25:44.150 --> 00:25:46.660
We don't say, well, we don't
know what's going to happen.

00:25:46.660 --> 00:25:48.610
Therefore we'll
discount the cash flows

00:25:48.610 --> 00:25:51.767
that we don't know
at 9% instead of 7%.

00:25:51.767 --> 00:25:53.350
That's not a good
way to approach it."

00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:54.391
This is very fundamental.

00:25:54.391 --> 00:25:56.420
Because what he's
saying is that in order

00:25:56.420 --> 00:26:00.860
to value a financial asset, he
uses the same discount rate.

00:26:00.860 --> 00:26:05.470
He doesn't use the idea of
equity risk premium at all.

00:26:05.470 --> 00:26:07.680
Clearly, Buffett does not
use an equity risk premium

00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:08.555
in the discount rate.

00:26:08.555 --> 00:26:11.880
He does not heavily
discount distant cash flows,

00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:14.930
delayed gratification, like
the children in the marshmallow

00:26:14.930 --> 00:26:15.710
experiment.

00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:18.250
And that gives him an
edge over competition,

00:26:18.250 --> 00:26:20.380
because he can pay
up for quality.

00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:21.960
He's not actually
overpaying for it.

00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:28.090
The second prejudice I'll
call hidden champions.

00:26:28.090 --> 00:26:31.820
This is taken from a wonderful
book called "Hidden Champions."

00:26:31.820 --> 00:26:35.792
in this book, the author writes
about extremely successful

00:26:35.792 --> 00:26:37.500
businesses that have
been below the radar

00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:40.760
for long periods of time,
hidden champions, really.

00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:43.040
"Large corporations," he
writes, "are the subject

00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:46.570
of close and constant scrutiny
by academic researchers,

00:26:46.570 --> 00:26:48.500
analysts, shareholders,
and journalists.

00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:50.000
Hidden champions,
on the other hand,

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:53.260
remain a virtually unexplored
source of knowledge."

00:26:53.260 --> 00:26:55.100
Scattered about the
globe, thousands

00:26:55.100 --> 00:26:56.650
of these highly
successful companies

00:26:56.650 --> 00:27:00.150
are concealed behind a curtain
of inconspicuous invisibility

00:27:00.150 --> 00:27:03.147
and, in some cases,
deliberate secrecy."

00:27:03.147 --> 00:27:05.230
"This applies to the
products these companies make

00:27:05.230 --> 00:27:07.042
and how they beat
their competition.

00:27:07.042 --> 00:27:08.500
And even more
difficult to research

00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:09.987
is how they're
managed internally.

00:27:09.987 --> 00:27:11.820
Even their names are
known to only a handful

00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:15.040
of experts, consultants,
journalists, and researchers.

00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:17.920
This secretiveness
contrasts starkly

00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:20.170
with the dominant positions
the hidden champions enjoy

00:27:20.170 --> 00:27:21.740
in their markets."

00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:24.150
"Many of them have global
market shares of more than 50%

00:27:24.150 --> 00:27:27.882
and even hold shares in the
relevant market of 70% to 90%.

00:27:27.882 --> 00:27:29.340
On average, they're
more than twice

00:27:29.340 --> 00:27:31.260
the size of their
strongest competitors.

00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:34.600
Only a few large multinationals
achieve comparable market

00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:36.260
positions."

00:27:36.260 --> 00:27:39.206
The question that he asks,
I think, is very important.

00:27:39.206 --> 00:27:40.080
Why does this happen?

00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:42.610
Why do these
outstanding companies

00:27:42.610 --> 00:27:43.660
remain below the radar?

00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:46.400
He offers many reasons,
but the most obvious one

00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:48.400
is that the large number
of the products offered

00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:52.540
by hidden champions go
unnoticed by consumers.

00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:55.620
"Many of these companies operate
in the hinterland of the value

00:27:55.620 --> 00:27:58.670
chain supplying machinery
components or processes that

00:27:58.670 --> 00:28:02.980
are no longer discernible in
the final product or service.

00:28:02.980 --> 00:28:05.685
As a result, the products
lose their distinct identity

00:28:05.685 --> 00:28:09.474
or autonomy."

00:28:09.474 --> 00:28:11.140
That's the most
interesting part for me.

00:28:11.140 --> 00:28:12.870
The products offered
by hidden champions

00:28:12.870 --> 00:28:15.230
go unnoticed by consumers.

00:28:15.230 --> 00:28:18.010
Such businesses not only
go unnoticed by consumers,

00:28:18.010 --> 00:28:21.186
I think they also go
unnoticed by investors.

00:28:21.186 --> 00:28:23.260
A related tendency
of the market is

00:28:23.260 --> 00:28:26.180
to categorize all businesses
in a commodity industry

00:28:26.180 --> 00:28:27.890
as crappy businesses,
something that I

00:28:27.890 --> 00:28:31.990
referred to in the context of
the airline industry just now.

00:28:31.990 --> 00:28:35.200
Indeed, some of the best ideas
in which my colleagues and I

00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:37.390
have invested have
exploited these prejudices

00:28:37.390 --> 00:28:40.300
of Mr. Market-- mispriced
B-to-B businesses which

00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:42.470
have business models
as good or even better

00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:45.300
than some exceptional
B-to-C businesses

00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:47.590
as well as profitable
niches hiding

00:28:47.590 --> 00:28:49.770
inside commodity industries.

00:28:49.770 --> 00:28:51.940
Indeed, Buffett and
Munger love the idea

00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:54.260
of investing in profitable
niche businesses operating

00:28:54.260 --> 00:28:56.830
in industries with
commodity characteristics.

00:28:56.830 --> 00:29:00.130
For example, Berkshire owns
several profitable niche

00:29:00.130 --> 00:29:02.780
insurance operations.

00:29:02.780 --> 00:29:05.450
And I quote, "The insurance
industry is cursed with a set

00:29:05.450 --> 00:29:07.480
of dismal economic
characteristics that make

00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:10.300
for a poor long-term outlook--
hundreds of competitors,

00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:13.310
ease of entry, and product that
cannot be differentiated in any

00:29:13.310 --> 00:29:14.520
meaningful way.

00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:16.280
In such a
commodity-like business,

00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:18.630
only the low cost operator
or someone operating

00:29:18.630 --> 00:29:20.460
in a protected,
usually small niche

00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:26.260
can sustain high
profitability levels."

00:29:26.260 --> 00:29:30.800
Charlie Munger has said that,
"in nature and in business,

00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:32.570
specialization is key.

00:29:32.570 --> 00:29:35.560
Just as in an ecosystem,
people who narrowly specialize

00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:38.620
can get terribly good at
occupying some little niche,

00:29:38.620 --> 00:29:40.937
just as animals
flourish in niches,

00:29:40.937 --> 00:29:43.270
similarly, people who specialize
in the business world--

00:29:43.270 --> 00:29:45.079
and get very good
because they specialze--

00:29:45.079 --> 00:29:47.120
frequently find good
economics that they wouldn't

00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:48.870
find in any other way."

00:29:48.870 --> 00:29:51.650
So I think it makes a lot
of sense for investors

00:29:51.650 --> 00:29:54.690
to look for profitable niches
in commodity industries which

00:29:54.690 --> 00:29:57.860
are priced and-- mispriced,
rather-- as commodity

00:29:57.860 --> 00:29:58.737
businesses.

00:29:58.737 --> 00:30:01.320
That's the categorization that
the market is applying to them.

00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:04.620
That's the label that the market
is applying to them, painting

00:30:04.620 --> 00:30:07.130
everything with the same
brush, throwing the baby out

00:30:07.130 --> 00:30:10.160
with the bath water.

00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:14.600
The third prejudice that I have
is called learning machines.

00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:16.780
Now you live in a
world-- you live

00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:18.430
in that part of
the world-- where

00:30:18.430 --> 00:30:20.360
making mistakes and
encountering failures

00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:23.230
is celebrated and is
often a precondition

00:30:23.230 --> 00:30:26.650
for getting funding
from VCs or even a job.

00:30:26.650 --> 00:30:29.180
The world out there
is actually quite

00:30:29.180 --> 00:30:31.210
different from all of this.

00:30:31.210 --> 00:30:34.590
Where I come from, Mr. Market
has a prejudice against people

00:30:34.590 --> 00:30:35.840
who make mistakes.

00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:38.100
For a while, it is
unable to distinguish

00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:41.220
between people who make mistakes
and will continue to make them

00:30:41.220 --> 00:30:44.626
and people who Charlie Munger
would call learning machines.

00:30:44.626 --> 00:30:46.000
In other words,
it has a tendency

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:50.570
of categorizing all mistaken
entrepreneurs as dumb people.

00:30:50.570 --> 00:30:53.540
This prejudice doesn't
last forever, of course.

00:30:53.540 --> 00:30:57.380
But sometimes it lasts long
enough to make it exploitable.

00:30:57.380 --> 00:31:00.930
A few years ago, I invested in
a business which, at one time,

00:31:00.930 --> 00:31:04.340
was in bankruptcy but is, today,
one of India's most profitable

00:31:04.340 --> 00:31:08.280
listed businesses as measured
by return on invested capital.

00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:09.760
The chief cause
of bankruptcy was

00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:12.440
a series of mistakes
made by its founder.

00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:15.520
Unlike many other entrepreneurs
however, this entrepreneur

00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:17.960
was not only candid
about his mistakes,

00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:20.690
he was also determined
not to make them again.

00:31:20.690 --> 00:31:21.710
And he didn't.

00:31:21.710 --> 00:31:23.210
He got rid of a lot
of business that

00:31:23.210 --> 00:31:25.260
destroyed value and became
really good at doing

00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:26.850
one thing really well.

00:31:26.850 --> 00:31:28.484
He outsourced
manufacturing operations

00:31:28.484 --> 00:31:30.650
to eight vendors, which
dramatically boosted returns

00:31:30.650 --> 00:31:31.890
on capital.

00:31:31.890 --> 00:31:33.850
He got out of debt and
has a liquid balance

00:31:33.850 --> 00:31:36.350
sheet with surplus cash and has
committed that he will never

00:31:36.350 --> 00:31:38.010
borrow money again.

00:31:38.010 --> 00:31:41.014
He made a very wise acquisition
at a ridiculously low price

00:31:41.014 --> 00:31:43.180
which not only gave him
access to important patented

00:31:43.180 --> 00:31:47.076
technology, it also opened
up a new big market for him.

00:31:47.076 --> 00:31:48.450
And there was this
period of time

00:31:48.450 --> 00:31:49.570
when the market
pretty much ignored

00:31:49.570 --> 00:31:50.920
all the lessons he had learned.

00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:52.378
And the stock
continued to languish

00:31:52.378 --> 00:31:55.100
even though, during that time,
his company became the world's

00:31:55.100 --> 00:31:58.020
most dominant player
in that industry.

00:31:58.020 --> 00:31:59.770
But as Graham says,
in the long run,

00:31:59.770 --> 00:32:01.650
the market is a
weighing machine.

00:32:01.650 --> 00:32:04.010
And that's how I treated
this business too.

00:32:04.010 --> 00:32:06.230
Today, it is far more
appropriately valued

00:32:06.230 --> 00:32:07.880
and it's obvious
that Mr. Market has

00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:10.171
overcome its prejudice against
this particular learning

00:32:10.171 --> 00:32:11.310
machine.

00:32:11.310 --> 00:32:12.850
There's a pattern
here, of course.

00:32:12.850 --> 00:32:15.310
I think value investors
should consciously

00:32:15.310 --> 00:32:17.740
look for learning machines
which haven't been forgiven

00:32:17.740 --> 00:32:19.460
for their past mistakes.

00:32:19.460 --> 00:32:22.760
That's a prejudice
worth exploiting.

00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:25.060
The fourth one-- I
have five in total--

00:32:25.060 --> 00:32:28.320
is called serial acquirers.

00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:30.320
It's a well-known fact
that most acquisitions

00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:31.832
don't create value.

00:32:31.832 --> 00:32:34.040
That's because the acquirers
become overly optimistic

00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:35.998
about the prospects of
targets and overestimate

00:32:35.998 --> 00:32:38.670
the synergies of acquisitions.

00:32:38.670 --> 00:32:41.500
So we know the baseline
information for acquisition

00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:43.169
really sucks.

00:32:43.169 --> 00:32:44.960
So statistically
speaking, the stock market

00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:47.490
is absolutely right to
view serial acquirers

00:32:47.490 --> 00:32:49.540
with a great deal of skepticism.

00:32:49.540 --> 00:32:52.410
But this doesn't have to mean
that all serial acquirers will

00:32:52.410 --> 00:32:53.816
destroy value.

00:32:53.816 --> 00:32:54.940
There are a few exceptions.

00:32:54.940 --> 00:32:57.920
And sometimes the market
is prejudiced against them.

00:32:57.920 --> 00:33:00.520
The market's tendency to
categorize all serial acquirers

00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:03.980
as value destroyers is
an exploitable prejudice

00:33:03.980 --> 00:33:05.450
in my view.

00:33:05.450 --> 00:33:07.270
There are examples.

00:33:07.270 --> 00:33:10.590
Let's look at the common factors
in these serial acquirers which

00:33:10.590 --> 00:33:11.465
do create value.

00:33:11.465 --> 00:33:12.340
There a few examples.

00:33:12.340 --> 00:33:14.500
Henry Singleton was one.

00:33:14.500 --> 00:33:16.340
Warren Buffett clearly is one.

00:33:16.340 --> 00:33:19.360
[INAUDIBLE] financial
is another one.

00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:22.030
The common factors,
in my view, are, one,

00:33:22.030 --> 00:33:24.046
extreme financial
discipline-- that is,

00:33:24.046 --> 00:33:26.670
willingness to walk away from a
deal that doesn't make economic

00:33:26.670 --> 00:33:30.280
sense-- two, providing a
permanent home to a promising

00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:34.390
business, which is something
private equity funds cannot do,

00:33:34.390 --> 00:33:37.800
three, preserving the successful
culture of the acquired

00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:41.660
business, and four, providing
growth capital for sensible

00:33:41.660 --> 00:33:44.810
inorganic growth through
bolt-on acquisitions.

00:33:44.810 --> 00:33:46.710
For value investors,
making an investment

00:33:46.710 --> 00:33:49.370
in such a business when the
market is prejudiced against it

00:33:49.370 --> 00:33:52.130
makes a lot of economic sense
because of the option value

00:33:52.130 --> 00:33:54.210
embedded in such a situation.

00:33:54.210 --> 00:33:56.350
Successful serial
acquirers like Berkshire

00:33:56.350 --> 00:33:58.000
have carved out a
niche for themselves

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:01.410
to become preferred owners
of wonderful businesses.

00:34:01.410 --> 00:34:03.510
This competitive advantage
of sourcing deals

00:34:03.510 --> 00:34:06.050
not available to others has
significant option value

00:34:06.050 --> 00:34:07.090
over time.

00:34:07.090 --> 00:34:10.620
The investor is, in
effect, to borrow

00:34:10.620 --> 00:34:12.520
a term coined by
Professor Richard

00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:15.009
Zeckhouser in his wonderful
paper titled "investing

00:34:15.009 --> 00:34:17.570
in the Unknown and
the Unknowable,"

00:34:17.570 --> 00:34:20.260
a sidecar investment,
which is an individual who

00:34:20.260 --> 00:34:23.300
has exceptional sourcing skills
and a track record of value

00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:26.170
creation through
inorganic growth.

00:34:26.170 --> 00:34:28.620
The investor rides
around in a sidecar

00:34:28.620 --> 00:34:30.679
pulled by a powerful motorcycle.

00:34:30.679 --> 00:34:33.300
The more the investor is
distinctively positioned

00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:35.300
to have confidence in
the driver's integrity

00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:37.270
and his motorcycle's
capabilities,

00:34:37.270 --> 00:34:39.059
the more attractive
the investment.

00:34:42.550 --> 00:34:46.820
Prejudice five is called
freaks and misfits.

00:34:46.820 --> 00:34:49.030
Now I'm almost sure
you've seen this before.

00:34:49.030 --> 00:34:52.460
A few months ago, someone
asked a question on Quora.

00:34:52.460 --> 00:34:54.540
The question is on the screen.

00:34:54.540 --> 00:34:57.310
And Elon Musk's
ex-wife, Justine,

00:34:57.310 --> 00:35:00.090
gave an answer which
went viral and ended up

00:35:00.090 --> 00:35:02.570
being quoted by "New
York Times," "Vox,"

00:35:02.570 --> 00:35:07.100
CNBC, CNN, "The Huffington
Post," and "Time" magazine.

00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:10.250
Here's an excerpt
from her reply.

00:35:10.250 --> 00:35:12.410
"Extreme success results
from extreme personality

00:35:12.410 --> 00:35:14.920
and comes at the cost
of many other things.

00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:17.030
Extreme success is
different from what I

00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:19.930
suppose you would call success.

00:35:19.930 --> 00:35:23.080
So know that you don't
have to be Richard or Elon

00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:26.180
to be affluent and accomplished
and maintain a great lifestyle.

00:35:26.180 --> 00:35:28.250
Your odds of happiness
are better that way."

00:35:28.250 --> 00:35:30.260
"But if you are
extreme, you must

00:35:30.260 --> 00:35:32.620
be what you are, which
means that happiness is

00:35:32.620 --> 00:35:34.740
more or less besides the point.

00:35:34.740 --> 00:35:37.810
These people tend to be
freaks and misfits who

00:35:37.810 --> 00:35:40.070
are forced to experience
the world in an unusually

00:35:40.070 --> 00:35:41.220
challenging way.

00:35:41.220 --> 00:35:44.590
They develop
strategies to survive.

00:35:44.590 --> 00:35:47.710
And as they grew
older, they found ways

00:35:47.710 --> 00:35:49.660
to apply these strategies
to other things

00:35:49.660 --> 00:35:53.100
and create for themselves a
distinct and power advantage."

00:35:53.100 --> 00:35:55.740
"They don't think the
way other people think.

00:35:55.740 --> 00:35:59.870
They see things from angles that
unlock new ideas and insights.

00:35:59.870 --> 00:36:03.700
Other people consider them
to be somewhat insane."

00:36:03.700 --> 00:36:05.510
The term "freaks
and misfits," which

00:36:05.510 --> 00:36:11.510
might ring a bell with you given
the culture that we are in,

00:36:11.510 --> 00:36:12.860
was taken from Justine.

00:36:12.860 --> 00:36:15.690
I think it's important for us
to understand her perspective.

00:36:15.690 --> 00:36:19.500
And that is something that a
professor from Harvard Business

00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:25.330
School, Joseph Badaracco,
offers an explanation.

00:36:25.330 --> 00:36:27.679
Here the professor
uses literary fiction

00:36:27.679 --> 00:36:29.970
to teach leadership to the
students at Harvard Business

00:36:29.970 --> 00:36:31.090
School.

00:36:31.090 --> 00:36:33.520
In this book "Questions
of Character"

00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:35.600
he writes, "How
does serious fiction

00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:37.560
help us understand leadership?

00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:40.580
The answer is simple but
extraordinarily powerful.

00:36:40.580 --> 00:36:42.900
Serious fiction gives
us a unique inside view

00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:44.030
of leadership.

00:36:44.030 --> 00:36:46.070
In real life, most
people see the leaders

00:36:46.070 --> 00:36:48.420
of their organizations
only occasionally"--

00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:50.720
as investors, this is
exactly what we get to see.

00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:53.810
We don't get to see what is
really happening-- "and only

00:36:53.810 --> 00:36:56.680
get a fleeting glimpse of what
these leaders are thinking

00:36:56.680 --> 00:36:57.600
and feeling."

00:36:57.600 --> 00:37:00.560
"Even interviews with
executives have limits.

00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:02.339
Executives only say so much.

00:37:02.339 --> 00:37:03.880
And even when they
want to be candid,

00:37:03.880 --> 00:37:05.520
sensitivities have
to be observed,

00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:08.260
memory fades and
sometimes distorts,

00:37:08.260 --> 00:37:10.990
and success crowds out failures.

00:37:10.990 --> 00:37:15.250
In contrast, serious literature
offers a view from the inside.

00:37:15.250 --> 00:37:19.020
It opens doors to a world
rarely seen except, on occasion,

00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:21.970
by leaders' spouses
and closest friends."

00:37:21.970 --> 00:37:24.350
Think Justine Musk.

00:37:24.350 --> 00:37:26.500
"It lets us watch
leaders as they

00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:31.090
think, work, hope, hesitate,
commit, exalt, regret,

00:37:31.090 --> 00:37:32.610
and reflect.

00:37:32.610 --> 00:37:36.060
We see their characters
tested, reshaped, strengthened,

00:37:36.060 --> 00:37:37.760
or weakened."

00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:40.840
The reason why Justine's
perspective is important for us

00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:43.730
is because, as the
professor puts it,

00:37:43.730 --> 00:37:46.920
"it opens doors to a
world rarely seen, except,

00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:50.170
on occasion, by leaders'
spouses and closest friends."

00:37:50.170 --> 00:37:52.490
In my view, when it
comes to evaluating

00:37:52.490 --> 00:37:55.180
the quality of extremely
successful entrepreneurs

00:37:55.180 --> 00:37:56.760
in the early part
of the journey,

00:37:56.760 --> 00:37:59.820
the market displays a prejudice.

00:37:59.820 --> 00:38:01.830
This prejudice is
derived not only

00:38:01.830 --> 00:38:03.420
from the complex
personality that some

00:38:03.420 --> 00:38:06.090
of these entrepreneurs have,
many of the whom are definitely

00:38:06.090 --> 00:38:10.070
not likable people, but
also from a limited view

00:38:10.070 --> 00:38:15.060
about the individual in
question that investors get.

00:38:15.060 --> 00:38:18.430
I've seen this prejudice
play out over and over again.

00:38:18.430 --> 00:38:22.276
The market is just too
judgmental about some of them.

extraordinary human beings.

Charlie agrees.

00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:30.850
In an interview with Miguel
Barbosa of Simoleon Sense,

00:39:30.850 --> 00:39:33.450
successful value
investor Paul Lountzis

00:39:33.450 --> 00:39:36.650
has said, "The ability

00:39:44.110 --> 00:39:47.400
I'm typically attracted to a
company because of the numbers.

00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:50.130
But what makes you enormously
successful for your clients

00:39:50.130 --> 00:39:52.310
is when you identify
qualitative factors that

00:39:52.310 --> 00:39:55.240
are yet to appear in the
quantitative results.

00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:57.819
The key is to identify
these situations early.

00:39:57.819 --> 00:39:59.860
You still have those
opportunities when companies

00:39:59.860 --> 00:40:01.859
are small, but it's getting
harder because there

00:40:01.859 --> 00:40:03.280
are many smart people looking.

00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:06.160

But if you can do
it or get lucky,

00:40:23.100 --> 00:40:25.530
then you can do very
well for your clients.

00:40:25.530 --> 00:40:28.780
By having an edge, you
will avoid overpaying.

00:40:28.780 --> 00:40:31.510
You're protected on the downside
and you have enormous upside

00:40:31.510 --> 00:40:34.390
because you're piggybacking
on a visionary who's building

00:40:34.390 --> 00:40:35.920
an extraordinary culture.

00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:38.740
With the long-run way,
because of this mispricing,

00:40:38.740 --> 00:40:40.939
you can stay with
them for 20 years.

00:40:40.939 --> 00:40:42.980
Furthermore, because you
have done your research,

00:40:42.980 --> 00:40:44.810
and you understand how
this visionary is building

00:40:44.810 --> 00:40:46.518
the business, and you
have the confidence

00:40:46.518 --> 00:40:49.790
to survive all the vicissitudes
of the market, when you

00:40:49.790 --> 00:40:51.410
go through tough
times, you recognize

00:40:51.410 --> 00:40:55.270
they have a stable
competitive advantage.

00:40:55.270 --> 00:40:57.360
They've got better
people, they're tenacious,

00:40:57.360 --> 00:40:59.297
and they're likely
to come out stronger.

00:40:59.297 --> 00:41:00.880
It's an important
distinction that I'm

00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:02.950
trying to make that
the qualitative is

00:41:02.950 --> 00:41:04.660
becoming more important.

00:41:04.660 --> 00:41:06.460
I still think
quantitative features are

00:41:06.460 --> 00:41:08.460
subordinate to the business
model in valuation,

00:41:08.460 --> 00:41:11.200
but the business model
is infinity more impacted

00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:15.380
by management and culture
than it was in the past.

00:41:15.380 --> 00:41:17.780
I think it's terribly
important for value investors

00:41:17.780 --> 00:41:20.690
to recognize that a key
source of investment success

00:41:20.690 --> 00:41:23.760
is to become long-term
passive partners

00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:26.610
with extraordinary human
beings who many would

00:41:26.610 --> 00:41:29.230
regard as freaks or misfits.

00:41:29.230 --> 00:41:32.490
When George Bernard Shaw said
that "the reasonable man adapts

00:41:32.490 --> 00:41:35.450
himself to the world;
the unreasonable one

00:41:35.450 --> 00:41:38.040
persists in trying to
adapt the world to himself.

00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:41.580
Therefore all progress depends
on the unreasonable man,"

00:41:41.580 --> 00:41:45.300
was he talking about
freaks and misfits?

00:41:45.300 --> 00:41:48.470
Shouldn't the label of freak
and misfit not sometimes

00:41:48.470 --> 00:41:51.550
be relabeled as
intelligent fanatics?

00:41:51.550 --> 00:41:54.350
That's what this bias is
about, the representativeness

00:41:54.350 --> 00:41:56.330
heuristic, labels.

00:41:56.330 --> 00:41:57.740
We apply labels.

00:41:57.740 --> 00:42:00.430
And a label of a
freak and misfit,

00:42:00.430 --> 00:42:02.590
which is a negative
connotation, can easily

00:42:02.590 --> 00:42:06.960
be sometimes relabeled as
an intelligent fanatic.

00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:09.860
And it makes all the difference.

00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:11.960
One of my key learnings
from studying such people

00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:15.010
is that, as an investor, I have
to teach myself to overlook

00:42:15.010 --> 00:42:17.580
many of their personality
traits, some of which

00:42:17.580 --> 00:42:19.490
are not admirable at all.

00:42:19.490 --> 00:42:22.080
Indeed, I think those
traits are a consequence

00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:24.516
of their fanatic
focus on their work.

00:42:24.516 --> 00:42:26.140
I have been consciously
training myself

00:42:26.140 --> 00:42:29.530
to empathize with such
extraordinary human beings.

00:42:33.550 --> 00:42:35.920
In his wonderful book
"The Social Animal,"

00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:39.860
Elliot Aronson talks about the
insidious nature of prejudice.

00:42:39.860 --> 00:42:43.250
He quotes a fictional
dialogue from Gordon Allport's

00:42:43.250 --> 00:42:45.270
classic book "The
Nature of Prejudice."

00:42:45.270 --> 00:42:47.380
I think the dialogue
is worth reading.

00:42:47.380 --> 00:42:50.210
Mr. X says that "the
trouble with Jews

00:42:50.210 --> 00:42:52.610
is that they only take
care of their own group."

00:42:52.610 --> 00:42:56.250
Mr. Y, who's the prejudiced
person, says-- sorry,

00:42:56.250 --> 00:42:57.560

00:43:00.340 --> 00:43:03.080
He says, "But the record of
the Community Chest campaign

00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:05.030
shows that they give
more generously,

00:43:05.030 --> 00:43:07.530
in proportion to their numbers,
to the general charities

00:43:07.530 --> 00:43:10.120
of the community
than do non-Jews."

00:43:10.120 --> 00:43:12.740
Mr. X then responds,
"That shows they're always

00:43:12.740 --> 00:43:15.680
trying to buy favor and
intrude into Christian affairs.

00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:17.300
They think of nothing but money.

00:43:17.300 --> 00:43:19.840
And that's why there are
so many Jewish bankers."

00:43:19.840 --> 00:43:22.280
Mr. Y responds,
"But a recent study

00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:25.280
shows that the percentage of
Jews in the banking business

00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:28.530
is negligible, far smaller than
the percentage of non-Jews."

00:43:28.530 --> 00:43:31.160
Mr. X then responds,
"That's just it.

00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:33.314

00:43:34.730 --> 00:43:37.880
or they run nightclubs."

00:43:37.880 --> 00:43:40.280
The dialogue illustrates
the insidious nature

00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:43.520
of prejudice far better than
the mountain of definitions.

00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:46.070
In effect, the prejudiced
Mr. X is saying,

00:43:46.070 --> 00:43:47.450
don't trouble me with the facts.

00:43:47.450 --> 00:43:49.210
My mind is made up.

00:43:49.210 --> 00:43:51.270
He makes no attempt to
dispute the data presented

00:43:51.270 --> 00:43:54.220
by Mr. Y. He either
distorts the facts in order

00:43:54.220 --> 00:43:56.030
to make them support
his hatred of Jews

00:43:56.030 --> 00:43:58.860
or he bounces off
them, undaunted,

00:43:58.860 --> 00:44:03.510
to a new area of attack.

00:44:03.510 --> 00:44:05.460
A deeply prejudiced
person is virtually

00:44:05.460 --> 00:44:07.290
immune to information
at variance

00:44:07.290 --> 00:44:10.060
with his or her
cherished stereotypes.

00:44:10.060 --> 00:44:14.120
As famed jurist Oliver
Wendell Holmes, Jr. once said,

00:44:14.120 --> 00:44:18.730
"Trying to educate a bigot
is like shining light

00:44:18.730 --> 00:44:22.790
into the pupil of an
eye-- it constricts."

00:44:22.790 --> 00:44:26.460
Whlie Aronson's words, that
a deeply prejudiced person

00:44:26.460 --> 00:44:29.080
is virtually immune to
information at variance

00:44:29.080 --> 00:44:31.600
with his or her
cherished stereotypes,

00:44:31.600 --> 00:44:34.110
apply to many
prejudiced human beings,

00:44:34.110 --> 00:44:37.310
they do apply, if you think
about it, to Mr. Market.

00:44:37.310 --> 00:44:40.600
That's because Mr. Market
is a learning machine.

00:44:40.600 --> 00:44:43.700
He corrects his
prejudices over time.

00:44:43.700 --> 00:44:45.960
While the five patterns
of prejudice that I just

00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:51.190
outlined they keep coming
back in one form or the other,

00:44:51.190 --> 00:44:54.150
the prejudice against
specific examples

00:44:54.150 --> 00:44:57.610
conforming to these patterns
tends to disappear over time.

00:44:57.610 --> 00:45:01.420
We have a name for that,
and we call that rerating.

00:45:01.420 --> 00:45:03.710
I think there are
two lessons here.

00:45:03.710 --> 00:45:06.340
The first one I've
already told you about.

00:45:06.340 --> 00:45:08.470
The second one is that
we should look at Mr.

00:45:08.470 --> 00:45:10.120
Market with some respect.

00:45:10.120 --> 00:45:14.700
After all, he's far
less prejudiced than us.

00:45:14.700 --> 00:45:18.620
Why couldn't we learn to get rid
of some of our own prejudices

00:45:18.620 --> 00:45:20.400
from him.

00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:22.161
Thank you.

00:45:22.161 --> 00:45:24.817
[APPLAUSE]

00:45:24.817 --> 00:45:26.150
MALE SPEAKER: Thank you, Sanjay.

00:45:26.150 --> 00:45:27.090
This was great.

00:45:27.090 --> 00:45:30.760
So we'll open up to some
questions right now.

00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:33.570
AUDIENCE: Thank you, Sanjay,
for the wonderful presentation.

00:45:33.570 --> 00:45:37.595
I had a question about
the last one, misfits,

00:45:37.595 --> 00:45:39.720
and maybe a little bit
about the learning machines.

00:45:39.720 --> 00:45:43.640
If we take Warren
Buffett as an example,

00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:46.320
you could say, ignoring
the past decade,

00:45:46.320 --> 00:45:48.160
most of the
investments he's made

00:45:48.160 --> 00:45:54.740
are in a handful of companies,
Geico, American Express

00:45:54.740 --> 00:45:57.470
in the beginning, in the
'60s, American Express again

00:45:57.470 --> 00:46:00.860
in the '90s, and a
few handful of others.

00:46:00.860 --> 00:46:05.290
Almost all of them he bought
at points of maximum pessimism.

00:46:05.290 --> 00:46:08.970
I can't maybe recollect
any example where he said,

00:46:08.970 --> 00:46:10.560
everything is great
with the business.

00:46:10.560 --> 00:46:12.080
And here's a misfit.

00:46:12.080 --> 00:46:13.640
Here's a learning machine.

00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:14.640
And I'm going to buy it.

00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:18.220
I think Coke may be
one such example.

00:46:18.220 --> 00:46:21.390
But there are more examples
where it was essentially,

00:46:21.390 --> 00:46:24.260
he was focused on the long term,
there was something temporarily

00:46:24.260 --> 00:46:26.770
wrong with the business,
and he bought it.

00:46:26.770 --> 00:46:30.530
He talks about jumping
one-foot hurdles.

00:46:30.530 --> 00:46:32.820
Sounds to me this is more
than a one-foot hurdle,

00:46:32.820 --> 00:46:35.570
identifying a misfit
or a learning machine.

00:46:35.570 --> 00:46:37.070
But maybe I don't
know any examples.

00:46:37.070 --> 00:46:39.027
Maybe you can enlighten us.

00:46:39.027 --> 00:46:39.860
SANJAY BAKSHI: Sure.

00:46:39.860 --> 00:46:42.040
I think it's
important to recognize

00:46:42.040 --> 00:46:45.540
that the examples that
you cited refer to what

00:46:45.540 --> 00:46:47.260
he's done in public markets.

00:46:47.260 --> 00:46:49.260
And what he does in
public markets actually

00:46:49.260 --> 00:46:52.000
is a very small portion of
what actually really happens

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:53.180
in Berkshire.

00:46:53.180 --> 00:46:55.450
As you probably
know, they have, I

00:46:55.450 --> 00:46:57.330
think, more than
80 businesses now,

00:46:57.330 --> 00:47:00.730
in their portfolio, which they
own wholly or almost wholly.

00:47:00.730 --> 00:47:02.860
And they have been
generating a lot of cash.

00:47:02.860 --> 00:47:05.790
So there have been
all these businesses.

00:47:05.790 --> 00:47:08.850
When I talked about
the idea of misfits,

00:47:08.850 --> 00:47:13.000
I was really referring
to the apprehensions

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:16.770
that public market investors
have about the character

00:47:16.770 --> 00:47:18.910
of these people.

00:47:18.910 --> 00:47:23.010
Sometimes these people do things
which look very, very odd.

00:47:23.010 --> 00:47:25.149
And they odd in the since
that, after all, these

00:47:25.149 --> 00:47:26.440
are extraordinary human beings.

00:47:26.440 --> 00:47:28.420
They don't do things
which look ordinary.

00:47:28.420 --> 00:47:31.162
And I'm not talking
about innovation.

00:47:31.162 --> 00:47:32.370
Of course that is one aspect.

00:47:32.370 --> 00:47:34.240
I'm not talking about risk
taking, or innovation, or any

00:47:34.240 --> 00:47:34.900
of that.

00:47:34.900 --> 00:47:38.150
I'm talking about
things that appear

00:47:38.150 --> 00:47:41.160
to be sometimes
unethical, but they really

00:47:41.160 --> 00:47:45.800
are not a big deal in the
whole totality of things.

00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:50.290
So I'll give an example
without naming names.

00:47:50.290 --> 00:47:51.870
There are businesses
which I have

00:47:51.870 --> 00:47:56.930
looked at in the past where
the entrepreneur may have paid

00:47:56.930 --> 00:48:00.160
himself a really nice salary.

00:48:00.160 --> 00:48:02.710
Now if you focus
only on that aspect--

00:48:02.710 --> 00:48:05.920
and it may turn out to be
something like 10% of profits.

00:48:05.920 --> 00:48:08.090
But the fact of the
matter is that he's

00:48:08.090 --> 00:48:09.420
an extraordinary human being.

00:48:09.420 --> 00:48:11.150
And 10% does look big.

00:48:11.150 --> 00:48:12.900
But if you look at the
overall situation--

00:48:12.900 --> 00:48:14.941
if you look at the fact
of what he's accomplished

00:48:14.941 --> 00:48:16.850
and the kind of moat
that he has built--

00:48:16.850 --> 00:48:19.730
in the totality of
things, you just suck up.

00:48:19.730 --> 00:48:22.400
And you have a choice.

00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:24.400
Either you want to be a
partner with him or not.

00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:26.770
But I think the
opportunity cost of not

00:48:26.770 --> 00:48:29.640
being a partner with a guy like
him, an extraordinary person,

00:48:29.640 --> 00:48:31.380
is actually quite high.

00:48:31.380 --> 00:48:34.050
So you have to swallow
a lot of things

00:48:34.050 --> 00:48:36.570
which may, under
normal circumstances,

00:48:36.570 --> 00:48:39.200
be something that you might
want to walk away from.

00:48:39.200 --> 00:48:41.690
And the reason is because
of the extraordinary moat

00:48:41.690 --> 00:48:43.820
that he has created.

00:48:43.820 --> 00:48:45.050
So that's just one example.

00:48:45.050 --> 00:48:46.780
I'll give you a
few other examples.

00:48:46.780 --> 00:48:52.070
I know of a business where
the premier credit rating

00:48:52.070 --> 00:48:56.900
company in the country
resigned the assignment.

00:48:56.900 --> 00:48:57.500
Why?

00:48:57.500 --> 00:48:58.980
Because he's not cooperating.

00:48:58.980 --> 00:49:00.750
He basically told
them, buzz off.

00:49:00.750 --> 00:49:04.320
I'm not going to give
you the information.

00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:06.010
And if you remember,
Charlie Munger

00:49:06.010 --> 00:49:09.996
did pretty much the same
thing with the auditors

00:49:09.996 --> 00:49:11.230
in "Daily Journal."

00:49:11.230 --> 00:49:13.080
And he had a huge tiff
with the auditors.

00:49:13.080 --> 00:49:15.260
That's the point I'm making.

00:49:15.260 --> 00:49:16.850
These guys have
what Charlie Munger

00:49:16.850 --> 00:49:19.130
called a lot of chutzpah.

00:49:19.130 --> 00:49:20.780
They absolutely
don't give a shit

00:49:20.780 --> 00:49:22.530
about what anybody
else thinks about them.

00:49:22.530 --> 00:49:24.029
They think they're
absolutely right.

00:49:24.029 --> 00:49:26.840
And it reminds me of what
Charlie Munger has said, never

00:49:26.840 --> 00:49:29.754
underestimate a man who
overestimates himself.

00:49:29.754 --> 00:49:31.670
And all entrepreneurs
overestimate themselves.

00:49:31.670 --> 00:49:35.200
And overconfidence is a very
important aspect of capitalism.

00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:38.695
What I'm trying to distinguish
is between the dumb fanatics

00:49:38.695 --> 00:49:40.440
and the intelligent fanatics.

00:49:40.440 --> 00:49:41.940
And I gave a talk
sometime back when

00:49:41.940 --> 00:49:45.470
I made that distinction
where I profiled

00:49:45.470 --> 00:49:47.540
seven intelligent
fanatics from India.

00:49:47.540 --> 00:49:51.240
And I gave a kind
of a checklist as

00:49:51.240 --> 00:49:54.140
to how I think about intelligent
fanatics versus dumb fanatics.

00:49:54.140 --> 00:49:58.750
So one of them is debt
or risk management.

00:49:58.750 --> 00:50:00.930
So a dumb fanatic
would-- they're

00:50:00.930 --> 00:50:03.510
all overconfident whether
you're dumb or not.

00:50:03.510 --> 00:50:06.820
But they bet the bank.

00:50:06.820 --> 00:50:08.240
And sometimes they get lucky.

00:50:08.240 --> 00:50:09.807
Most of the time, they blow up.

00:50:09.807 --> 00:50:11.890
So they don't know anything
about risk management.

00:50:11.890 --> 00:50:15.380
Whereas an intelligent fanatic
would make a series of bets.

00:50:15.380 --> 00:50:18.310
He's, like, writing insurance.

00:50:18.310 --> 00:50:20.930
And many of those
bets will fail.

00:50:20.930 --> 00:50:23.280
But even if all
of them fail, that

00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:24.720
doesn't destroy the company.

00:50:24.720 --> 00:50:25.464
So that's one.

00:50:25.464 --> 00:50:27.130
The other is they
almost certainly don't

00:50:27.130 --> 00:50:28.338
rely on other people's money.

00:50:28.338 --> 00:50:29.910
They use their own capital.

00:50:29.910 --> 00:50:31.170
They don't borrow money.

00:50:31.170 --> 00:50:34.330
So they don't create
financial structures

00:50:34.330 --> 00:50:37.570
where they are dependent upon
the kindness of strangers

00:50:37.570 --> 00:50:38.240
over there.

00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:39.100
So I see that.

00:50:39.100 --> 00:50:42.160
I see fanaticism, when
combined with intelligence,

00:50:42.160 --> 00:50:45.090
that combined together, makes
a very nice combination.

00:50:45.090 --> 00:50:47.880
You see that it's so rare.

00:50:47.880 --> 00:50:50.340
If you look at the history
of wealth creation,

00:50:50.340 --> 00:50:53.330
when you find this
fanaticism with intelligence

00:50:53.330 --> 00:50:55.360
and integrity-- when you
combine those three--

00:50:55.360 --> 00:50:58.829
and if you can get it along
with a reasonable business--

00:50:58.829 --> 00:51:00.370
and that's the point
I'm making here,

00:51:00.370 --> 00:51:03.410
which is the point that even
in commodity industries,

00:51:03.410 --> 00:51:05.240
some entrepreneurs
have the ability

00:51:05.240 --> 00:51:07.720
to carve out a niche which
is very hard to copy.

00:51:07.720 --> 00:51:10.090
And that niche is coming
from the fanaticism

00:51:10.090 --> 00:51:11.580
of the entrepreneur.

00:51:11.580 --> 00:51:13.080
As it's a very smart person.

00:51:13.080 --> 00:51:15.610
And therefore, if you can
become partners with him

00:51:15.610 --> 00:51:18.940
on favorable terms in terms
of valuation and all of that,

00:51:18.940 --> 00:51:23.470
then you can ignore a lot of
other things, which is what

00:51:23.470 --> 00:51:25.970
Elon Musk's ex-wife was saying.

00:51:25.970 --> 00:51:27.830
They are crazy in many ways.

00:51:27.830 --> 00:51:32.010
These guys-- or women-- they
are very nutty in many ways.

00:51:32.010 --> 00:51:35.205
But I think you should not
over-focus on those matters.

00:51:35.205 --> 00:51:38.420
You should only focus on the
track record-- what they do,

00:51:38.420 --> 00:51:42.202
how they run their
business operations.

00:51:42.202 --> 00:51:43.660
MALE SPEAKER: So
if I can just push

00:51:43.660 --> 00:51:45.793
that question a
little bit further--

00:51:45.793 --> 00:51:47.520
SANJAY BAKSHI: Yes, Soreb.

00:51:47.520 --> 00:51:51.130
MALE SPEAKER: So not to say
that there are no intelligent

00:51:51.130 --> 00:51:55.620
fanatics and so on, but to
borrow that phrase of whether

00:51:55.620 --> 00:51:59.170
it is actually a one-foot
hurdle versus a six-foot hurdle,

00:51:59.170 --> 00:51:59.730
so to say--

00:51:59.730 --> 00:52:00.670
SANJAY BAKSHI: It
doesn't have to be.

00:52:00.670 --> 00:52:03.110
You see, the point is if
you're going to-- what

00:52:03.110 --> 00:52:04.230
are we trying to do here?

00:52:04.230 --> 00:52:05.440
We're trying to
compound capital, right?

00:52:05.440 --> 00:52:07.023
We are doing it
sitting in our offices

00:52:07.023 --> 00:52:08.650
in an air-conditioned
environment

00:52:08.650 --> 00:52:11.980
without stepping out or actually
[INAUDIBLE] try to become rich.

00:52:11.980 --> 00:52:13.590
So it shouldn't be easy.

00:52:13.590 --> 00:52:15.590
I don't think the
idea of compounding

00:52:15.590 --> 00:52:17.819
capital at superlative
rates of return

00:52:17.819 --> 00:52:20.110
over long periods of time
should become extraordinarily

00:52:20.110 --> 00:52:21.560
easy for anybody.

00:52:21.560 --> 00:52:24.470
If it was, then those
returns will go away.

00:52:24.470 --> 00:52:27.290
So I don't think it
should be that easy.

00:52:27.290 --> 00:52:29.990
When Mr. Buffett talks
about one-foot hurdles,

00:52:29.990 --> 00:52:31.976
he's talking about
his ability to predict

00:52:31.976 --> 00:52:33.600
the fundamental
economics of a business

00:52:33.600 --> 00:52:35.120
over a long period of time.

00:52:35.120 --> 00:52:37.790
And believe it or
not, many businesses

00:52:37.790 --> 00:52:40.210
that he has invested in
are actually quite complex.

00:52:40.210 --> 00:52:41.990
So for a lot of
people, the ability

00:52:41.990 --> 00:52:47.710
to understand supercar
insurance is actually

00:52:47.710 --> 00:52:49.050
very, very different.

00:52:49.050 --> 00:52:50.160
But he has done that.

00:52:50.160 --> 00:52:51.850
So he defines a
circle of competence

00:52:51.850 --> 00:52:54.200
and he tries to stay within
that circle of competence.

00:52:54.200 --> 00:52:57.740
And I think that's a
wonderful model to have.

00:52:57.740 --> 00:53:00.980
But to assume that you will
find very simple things

00:53:00.980 --> 00:53:05.360
to do all along, I think that's
something which I don't really

00:53:05.360 --> 00:53:06.270
believe in.

00:53:06.270 --> 00:53:07.850
AUDIENCE: I have a
two-part question.

00:53:07.850 --> 00:53:10.790
Why is it that the
stereotyping-- is

00:53:10.790 --> 00:53:14.100
it correct or incorrect--
is often found in hindsight,

00:53:14.100 --> 00:53:15.640
with the benefit of hindsight.

00:53:15.640 --> 00:53:18.700
With the disparities that
you listed, all five of them,

00:53:18.700 --> 00:53:21.970
are there certain tips or
shortcuts, further shortcuts,

00:53:21.970 --> 00:53:25.680
which you can tell to
distinguish between what

00:53:25.680 --> 00:53:28.710
could be an incorrect
assessment of opportunities

00:53:28.710 --> 00:53:32.950
which the market could
correlate over time?

00:53:32.950 --> 00:53:35.250
Like, how would you distinguish
between luck and skill

00:53:35.250 --> 00:53:35.917
and define this?

00:53:35.917 --> 00:53:37.083
SANJAY BAKSHI: Track record.

00:53:37.083 --> 00:53:37.890
Track record.

00:53:37.890 --> 00:53:40.056
You're really looking at
the long-term track record.

00:53:40.056 --> 00:53:42.250
If it was all luck, then
over a period of time,

00:53:42.250 --> 00:53:45.120
that would go away, right?

00:53:45.120 --> 00:53:47.460
What I'm trying to
illustrate is the point

00:53:47.460 --> 00:53:49.540
that there are these
patterns that play out.

00:53:49.540 --> 00:53:50.760
What we're trying to
do is if we picked

00:53:50.760 --> 00:53:53.009
one-- I picked this one
heuristic, the representative.

00:53:53.009 --> 00:53:55.060
There are many others.

00:53:55.060 --> 00:53:57.330
I just picked one
and I tried to think

00:53:57.330 --> 00:54:00.470
about the various manifestations
in which it occurs,

00:54:00.470 --> 00:54:03.710
which creates tradable
opportunities for public market

00:54:03.710 --> 00:54:04.960
investors.

00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:08.545
What I found was that the
whole idea of labeling-- and I

00:54:08.545 --> 00:54:12.335
mentioned that some time ago,
that intelligent fanatic is

00:54:12.335 --> 00:54:13.145
just a label.

00:54:13.145 --> 00:54:19.440
To somebody else, it might
look like a freak person.

00:54:19.440 --> 00:54:23.190
But to somebody else, it could
be an intelligent fanatic.

00:54:23.190 --> 00:54:24.876
But what is the truth?

00:54:24.876 --> 00:54:26.125
The truth lies in the numbers.

00:54:26.125 --> 00:54:28.620
The truth lies in what
they actually accomplish.

00:54:28.620 --> 00:54:31.720
So what we're really
looking at is, for example,

00:54:31.720 --> 00:54:34.710
in an industry with sub-normal
profitability-- take airlines.

00:54:34.710 --> 00:54:37.160
We saw that-- there is
one company which has

00:54:37.160 --> 00:54:39.720
extraordinary profitability.

00:54:39.720 --> 00:54:41.720
So we all question why,
why is that happening.

00:54:41.720 --> 00:54:44.940
Is this luck or is this skill?

00:54:44.940 --> 00:54:46.590
And to answer that,
you have to look

00:54:46.590 --> 00:54:48.312
at the record over a
long period of time.

00:54:48.312 --> 00:54:50.520
You have to look at the
track record of that business

00:54:50.520 --> 00:54:52.430
during periods when the
airline industry was

00:54:52.430 --> 00:54:53.900
going through a
horrible period of time.

00:54:53.900 --> 00:54:56.020
And if you do that for
Ryanair and for Southwest,

00:54:56.020 --> 00:54:59.160
you will find that they had some
unusual fundamental financial

00:54:59.160 --> 00:55:01.970
performance even during
periods when the entire airline

00:55:01.970 --> 00:55:04.400
industry in the world was
going through a terrible phase.

00:55:04.400 --> 00:55:07.500
So you try to look for
exceptional, outstanding

00:55:07.500 --> 00:55:10.030
performance over
long periods of time.

00:55:10.030 --> 00:55:13.070
And then you attribute
that to luck or skill.

00:55:13.070 --> 00:55:14.970
And occasionally, you
will find that there

00:55:14.970 --> 00:55:16.530
is some skill out there.

00:55:16.530 --> 00:55:19.900
The beauty is that the market
is not able to distinguish that.

00:55:19.900 --> 00:55:22.800
The market has this
labeling problem.

00:55:22.800 --> 00:55:24.675
The market thinks, oh,
it's a crappy business

00:55:24.675 --> 00:55:26.174
because it's in the
airline industry

00:55:26.174 --> 00:55:27.730
and because Warren
Buffett says so.

00:55:27.730 --> 00:55:31.220
Therefore it should not be
priced as a real good quality

00:55:31.220 --> 00:55:31.810
business.

00:55:31.810 --> 00:55:34.184
But if we ignore for the
moment, if you de-bias yourself,

00:55:34.184 --> 00:55:37.170
if you remove the name, the
label of the airline industry

00:55:37.170 --> 00:55:39.030
and think like a
Graham, who said,

00:55:39.030 --> 00:55:41.435
once, I want to be
completely unbiased.

00:55:41.435 --> 00:55:43.560
I don't want to even know
the name of the business,

00:55:43.560 --> 00:55:46.560
if you just look at the
actual objective data,

00:55:46.560 --> 00:55:48.800
you will find staggering
financial performance.

00:55:48.800 --> 00:55:50.577
You won't know what
the industry is.

00:55:50.577 --> 00:55:53.160
Just because you know that the
industry is an airline industry

00:55:53.160 --> 00:55:55.326
and there is this label
hovering around in your head

00:55:55.326 --> 00:55:57.630
that airlines are,
generally speaking--

00:55:57.630 --> 00:56:00.160
and that's a correct
label-- crappy businesses,

00:56:00.160 --> 00:56:03.180
you tend to misjudge
what you are seeing.

00:56:03.180 --> 00:56:06.172
And I think that's a bias
that is worth getting out of,

00:56:06.172 --> 00:56:07.630
because that's an
exploitable bias.

00:56:07.630 --> 00:56:10.790
That's a bias that the market
will, itself, get out of,

00:56:10.790 --> 00:56:12.480
which is where the
opportunity lies.

00:56:12.480 --> 00:56:14.940
Because you are
trying to buy it when

00:56:14.940 --> 00:56:16.410
the market still has that bias.

00:56:16.410 --> 00:56:19.645
And when the market doesn't, the
stock would have been rerated

00:56:19.645 --> 00:56:21.270
and you would have
made a lot of money.

00:56:21.270 --> 00:56:24.660
You see, the whole idea
in my work in investing

00:56:24.660 --> 00:56:26.140
in modern businesses,
what I found

00:56:26.140 --> 00:56:32.270
was the idea that moats can
only be found in some industries

00:56:32.270 --> 00:56:36.340
and never in other industries,
that itself is a prejudice.

00:56:36.340 --> 00:56:38.870
If you work hard enough,
even in businesses

00:56:38.870 --> 00:56:43.710
which have commodity labels,
you will find moated businesses,

00:56:43.710 --> 00:56:45.460
usually in niches.

00:56:45.460 --> 00:56:47.600
And when you find
them, you may often

00:56:47.600 --> 00:56:49.820
find that the market
is still treating them

00:56:49.820 --> 00:56:50.820
as a commodity business.

00:56:50.820 --> 00:56:52.630
That's the opportunity.

00:56:52.630 --> 00:56:55.030
AUDIENCE: So you spoke
about many value investors

00:56:55.030 --> 00:56:59.230
shying away from buying 25x
multiples and higher than that.

00:56:59.230 --> 00:57:03.610
And I think you also spoke about
intelligent fanatics and people

00:57:03.610 --> 00:57:07.620
who are driven and obsessed by
growth and returning profits.

00:57:07.620 --> 00:57:09.380
I guess the question
I have is, where

00:57:09.380 --> 00:57:12.870
does a healthy margin of
safety come into all of this.

00:57:12.870 --> 00:57:15.490
I think one of the reasons I
shy away from a 25x multiple

00:57:15.490 --> 00:57:18.179
is, what's my margin
of safety, right.

00:57:18.179 --> 00:57:20.220
I look at the previous
pace it's been trading at.

00:57:20.220 --> 00:57:21.292
I look at its growth.

00:57:21.292 --> 00:57:23.250
When I'm buying something
at a P/E value of 25,

00:57:23.250 --> 00:57:26.250
I'm expecting 10%, 15%
growth year-on-year

00:57:26.250 --> 00:57:28.730
for the next decade, right?

00:57:28.730 --> 00:57:31.210
So I just wanted to hear
your thoughts on that.

00:57:31.210 --> 00:57:32.110
SANJAY BAKSHI: Sure.

00:57:32.110 --> 00:57:33.570
I'll answer that in two parts.

00:57:33.570 --> 00:57:35.870
Firstly, when you think
about P/E multiple,

00:57:35.870 --> 00:57:38.820
the P part is obvious because
it's observed from the market.

00:57:38.820 --> 00:57:41.720
It's the E part which
is quite subjective.

00:57:41.720 --> 00:57:46.470
And I mentioned
this-- in my judgment,

00:57:46.470 --> 00:57:49.610
in many moated
businesses, the E part

00:57:49.610 --> 00:57:52.360
is higher than what you
see over there for reasons

00:57:52.360 --> 00:57:53.520
that I explained.

00:57:53.520 --> 00:57:55.020
And when you make
those adjustments,

00:57:55.020 --> 00:57:58.589
then what looks expensive
is not that expensive.

00:57:58.589 --> 00:57:59.130
It's cheaper.

00:57:59.130 --> 00:58:00.010
That's one.

00:58:00.010 --> 00:58:03.260
Secondly, if you look at a
business that generally has

00:58:03.260 --> 00:58:05.840
a moat-- that means it
has strong entry barriers

00:58:05.840 --> 00:58:07.640
and it has the ability
to compound capital

00:58:07.640 --> 00:58:11.810
at lucrative rates for
long periods of time--

00:58:11.810 --> 00:58:15.100
if you do the math, as
Charlie has mentioned,

00:58:15.100 --> 00:58:18.630
even if you pay a 25 P/E
multiple for a business which

00:58:18.630 --> 00:58:22.130
is compounding capital
internally at a fabulous rate

00:58:22.130 --> 00:58:24.730
and has reinvestment
opportunities,

00:58:24.730 --> 00:58:26.380
it's the duration
of the opportunity.

00:58:26.380 --> 00:58:29.990
If you extend that from five
years to 10 years, and from 10

00:58:29.990 --> 00:58:32.810
to a longer period if
you have that conviction,

00:58:32.810 --> 00:58:35.040
then it becomes
quite attractive.

00:58:35.040 --> 00:58:37.340
I think you may be
referring to some businesses

00:58:37.340 --> 00:58:40.290
in this part of the word where
the growth rates are actually

00:58:40.290 --> 00:58:42.240
lower.

00:58:42.240 --> 00:58:45.480
Where I come from, growth
rates in many business

00:58:45.480 --> 00:58:46.590
are actually very high.

00:58:46.590 --> 00:58:50.370
They are sometimes in high
double-digit percentage

00:58:50.370 --> 00:58:51.410
numbers.

00:58:51.410 --> 00:58:56.420
AUDIENCE: In the context of
investing in Asian countries,

00:58:56.420 --> 00:58:59.485
two things that
come up and which

00:58:59.485 --> 00:59:03.380
cloud every other kind of
judgment for right or wrong

00:59:03.380 --> 00:59:07.370
is the authenticity of
what you see on the books.

00:59:07.370 --> 00:59:11.340
So first of all, a company
could be doing well

00:59:11.340 --> 00:59:12.890
for 10 years, 20 years.

00:59:12.890 --> 00:59:14.510
And these are very,
very big numbers.

00:59:14.510 --> 00:59:17.400
Some company is doing
good for two decades.

00:59:17.400 --> 00:59:18.900
And eventually
something blows up.

00:59:18.900 --> 00:59:21.550
And what you figure out is
that was a very, very big fraud

00:59:21.550 --> 00:59:22.059
going on.

00:59:22.059 --> 00:59:24.600
It could be numbers, could be
because the auditors were being

00:59:24.600 --> 00:59:27.460
bribed and all those things.

00:59:27.460 --> 00:59:29.880
It happens more
in Asian countries

00:59:29.880 --> 00:59:32.060
than, probably, North America.

00:59:32.060 --> 00:59:34.689
SANJAY BAKSHI: Is
that a prejudice?

00:59:34.689 --> 00:59:35.480
AUDIENCE: Could be.

00:59:35.480 --> 00:59:37.730
But when you're identifying
an individual company

00:59:37.730 --> 00:59:41.180
and you see returns
which far surpass

00:59:41.180 --> 00:59:45.980
the returns of other companies
in the same industry,

00:59:45.980 --> 00:59:48.494
one thing that one also
needs to scrutinize

00:59:48.494 --> 00:59:50.160
is, is there some
kind of a fraud that's

00:59:50.160 --> 00:59:50.965
going on over there.

00:59:50.965 --> 00:59:52.048
SANJAY BAKSHI: Absolutely.

00:59:52.048 --> 00:59:54.230
That's the whole point
of being an analyst is

00:59:54.230 --> 00:59:56.100
that you have to be skeptical.

00:59:56.100 --> 00:59:57.460
You have to have the diligence.

00:59:57.460 --> 00:59:59.405
You have to be able
to check the numbers.

00:59:59.405 --> 01:00:00.780
You have to do
background checks.

01:00:00.780 --> 01:00:01.650
There are a lot
of things that you

01:00:01.650 --> 01:00:03.930
need to do to make sure
that the numbers are right.

01:00:03.930 --> 01:00:05.410
If the numbers are not
right, then obviously

01:00:05.410 --> 01:00:07.159
you shouldn't be
investing in that anyway.

01:00:07.159 --> 01:00:09.460
Because if they
can cook the books,

01:00:09.460 --> 01:00:11.290
then you really don't
want to be a partner

01:00:11.290 --> 01:00:14.340
in a business run by a person
who is cooking the books,

01:00:14.340 --> 01:00:15.290
right?

01:00:15.290 --> 01:00:16.920
So I think it's
absolutely imperative

01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:18.072
that you do that test.

01:00:18.072 --> 01:00:20.030
And it doesn't matter
which country you are in.

01:00:20.030 --> 01:00:22.320
I think that there
was a Madoff here

01:00:22.320 --> 01:00:25.620
and there was an
Enron here as well.

01:00:25.620 --> 01:00:29.230
So it's something that
is a required discipline

01:00:29.230 --> 01:00:31.770
for any value investor,
to be able to do ascertain

01:00:31.770 --> 01:00:34.810
whether the numbers
are cooked or not.

01:00:34.810 --> 01:00:36.862
AUDIENCE: So how to do that in--

01:00:36.862 --> 01:00:38.820
SANJAY BAKSHI: I can do
a whole course on that.

01:00:38.820 --> 01:00:39.595
AUDIENCE: OK.

01:00:39.595 --> 01:00:42.160
SANJAY BAKSHI: Yeah, but
we can talk after this.

01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:44.610
There are some things.

01:00:44.610 --> 01:00:46.324
It depends on the industry.

01:00:46.324 --> 01:00:48.240
If you have to do that
in the banking industry

01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:49.550
it becomes far more complex.

01:00:49.550 --> 01:00:51.580
It's a very different
kind of business model.

01:00:51.580 --> 01:00:54.380
If you're looking at a
simpler business model then

01:00:54.380 --> 01:00:56.100
there are ways of doing that.

01:00:56.100 --> 01:00:58.230
And I'll be happy to talk
to you after about this.

01:00:58.230 --> 01:01:02.850
MALE SPEAKER: So because
this was a central point

01:01:02.850 --> 01:01:06.720
in, at least, the last half
of your talk, some of us

01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:09.070
were at the "Daily
Journal" meeting

01:01:09.070 --> 01:01:12.680
where Charlie Munger was asked
a question about Elon Musk.

01:01:12.680 --> 01:01:15.400
So I have a couple of the
sentences from Bloomberg

01:01:15.400 --> 01:01:17.470
Business's website.

01:01:17.470 --> 01:01:21.040
And Charlie says, "I think
Elon Musk is a genius,

01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:23.980
and I don't use
that word lightly.

01:01:23.980 --> 01:01:27.930
He's also one of the boldest
men who ever came down the pike.

01:01:27.930 --> 01:01:30.080
So put me down as
saying I've always

01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:35.680
been afraid of the guy whose IQ
is 190 and he thinks it's 250."

01:01:35.680 --> 01:01:39.420
So like you said,
never underestimate

01:01:39.420 --> 01:01:43.450
a person who is overconfident.

01:01:43.450 --> 01:01:47.935
But I think identifying
intelligent fanatics,

01:01:47.935 --> 01:01:52.570
so to say, versus investing
in Tesla or [INAUDIBLE],

01:01:52.570 --> 01:01:54.029
aren't they two
separate questions?

01:01:54.029 --> 01:01:56.069
SANJAY BAKSHI: They are
very different questions.

01:01:56.069 --> 01:01:57.740
All I'm looking at
is, without giving up

01:01:57.740 --> 01:02:00.150
on Buffett kind of
thinking, without giving up

01:02:00.150 --> 01:02:02.680
on the idea of investing
in highly profitable,

01:02:02.680 --> 01:02:05.850
dominant businesses which are
already making a lot of money

01:02:05.850 --> 01:02:09.330
and paying reasonable
multiples of their earning

01:02:09.330 --> 01:02:12.900
power, particularly when they're
run by an intelligent fanatic,

01:02:12.900 --> 01:02:15.250
is a great combination.

01:02:15.250 --> 01:02:16.990
I'm not recommending
Tesla, nor am I

01:02:16.990 --> 01:02:20.960
recommending Amazon.com
or any of the businesses

01:02:20.960 --> 01:02:25.270
that you might relate to the
idea of intelligent fanatics.

01:02:25.270 --> 01:02:27.020
I'm just saying,
because you can easily

01:02:27.020 --> 01:02:29.370
relate to those human
beings, that there

01:02:29.370 --> 01:02:30.690
are these people out there.

01:02:30.690 --> 01:02:32.857
They're not as well known
as these human beings are.

01:02:32.857 --> 01:02:34.398
But there are these
people out there.

01:02:34.398 --> 01:02:35.980
They are achieving
global dominance.

01:02:35.980 --> 01:02:37.220
And it's just a label.

01:02:37.220 --> 01:02:39.585
The point I'm trying to
make is that this whole talk

01:02:39.585 --> 01:02:42.210
was aboard labels,
labels as prejudices.

01:02:42.210 --> 01:02:44.040
And therefore,
sometimes a prejudice

01:02:44.040 --> 01:02:47.970
which is labeled as
a freak or a misfit,

01:02:47.970 --> 01:02:50.210
actually, the correct
label to apply to that

01:02:50.210 --> 01:02:51.775
is that of an
intelligent fanatic.

01:02:51.775 --> 01:02:53.400
And it doesn't have
to be an Elon Musk.

01:02:53.400 --> 01:02:55.580
It doesn't have
to be a Jeff Bezos

01:02:55.580 --> 01:02:56.770
or anybody for that matter.

01:02:56.770 --> 01:02:58.690
It has to be somebody
who's really passionate,

01:02:58.690 --> 01:03:01.550
has got integrity,
is completing driven,

01:03:01.550 --> 01:03:04.560
is not dumb in the sense that
it will not blow up the balance

01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:07.950
sheet on a single idea, it will
not lever up the balance sheet.

01:03:07.950 --> 01:03:10.540
It's conservative and
aggressive in a combination that

01:03:10.540 --> 01:03:13.300
is reflective of intelligence.

01:03:13.300 --> 01:03:15.100
And if you can find
that combination along

01:03:15.100 --> 01:03:17.280
with a great business or
even a reasonable business,

01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:18.830
that's the point of making.

01:03:18.830 --> 01:03:21.080
You don't have to look for
the best quality businesses

01:03:21.080 --> 01:03:22.750
out there because
they get priced out.

01:03:22.750 --> 01:03:26.000
In a parimutual system
of the stock market,

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:27.580
you can't bet on
the best horses.

01:03:27.580 --> 01:03:29.720
Because the best
horses, the odds change.

01:03:29.720 --> 01:03:32.230
You are betting against
other investors.

01:03:32.230 --> 01:03:35.550
And therefore, what you
should really be trying to do

01:03:35.550 --> 01:03:38.500
is find reasonable
quality businesses which

01:03:38.500 --> 01:03:42.245
have the taint of a
commodity on them,

01:03:42.245 --> 01:03:44.370
but the particular business
that you are looking at

01:03:44.370 --> 01:03:45.620
is an exception.

01:03:45.620 --> 01:03:47.410
It's an exception
because it's run

01:03:47.410 --> 01:03:51.350
by a fellow or a bunch of people
who are really exceptional.

01:03:51.350 --> 01:03:53.589
And you have got data
to validate that.

01:03:53.589 --> 01:03:54.880
You're not just dreaming it up.

01:03:54.880 --> 01:03:57.171
You're not just seeing it
because you read a prospectus

01:03:57.171 --> 01:03:59.690
on an IPO, and you think that
he will do wonderful things,

01:03:59.690 --> 01:04:01.440
and you believe he'll
do wonderful things.

01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:03.100
You actually have
seen that information.

01:04:03.100 --> 01:04:04.558
You've seen that
they have actually

01:04:04.558 --> 01:04:07.340
delivered, under
terrible conditions,

01:04:07.340 --> 01:04:09.789
fundamental performance which
is outstanding in relation

01:04:09.789 --> 01:04:11.080
to their peers in the industry.

01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:13.290
And you think that
you can attribute that

01:04:13.290 --> 01:04:16.210
to certain causal factors
that you can identify.

01:04:16.210 --> 01:04:18.890
And those factors will
remain for a long, long time.

01:04:18.890 --> 01:04:22.310
If you can find that with a
reasonable valuation, even

01:04:22.310 --> 01:04:24.740
in a normal industry-- not
an extraordinary profitable

01:04:24.740 --> 01:04:26.627
industry where
everybody makes money--

01:04:26.627 --> 01:04:28.960
I think it's a wonderful
combination, because the market

01:04:28.960 --> 01:04:30.077
is mispricing it.

01:04:30.077 --> 01:04:30.910
MALE SPEAKER: Great.

01:04:30.910 --> 01:04:32.732
So thank you, Sanjay,
for a fantastic talk.

01:04:32.732 --> 01:04:34.190
It was a pleasure
to have you here.

01:04:34.190 --> 01:04:34.910
SANJAY BAKSHI: Thank you.

01:04:34.910 --> 01:04:35.910
Thank you for having me.

01:04:35.910 --> 01:04:37.960
[APPLAUSE]
