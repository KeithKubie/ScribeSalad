00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:01.780
Wow

00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:07.559
That burst into flames in like one like instantly. Hey, what's up guys welcome back to the workshop

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.439
I'm here today with Nate and we got a pretty cool project for you today

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.070
We're building a mini solar scorcher now to this day

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.260
I still get comments and feedback from people at one of their favorite

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.939
Projects has always been the mega solar scorcher where I took the lens off of a giant flat-screen

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:27.479
TV and use sunlight to boil water and melt metal I also still get people asking me where to get those kind of TVs and

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.480
Which kind of TVs work and which ones don't I got a TV screen?

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.099
And I disassembled it the same way grant did in his but when I tried focusing the sunlight through it

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.110
It wouldn't focus into a pinpoint

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.989
So I was never really able to get that high heat that grant did and that's because not all TV Fernell lenses are created

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.128
equal so if you go out and get a TV it might work it might not so for this project we want to take the

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.939
Concept we wanted to scale it down so you can make a desktop solar scorcher

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.620
that's guaranteed to work every time check this out so for this project you're gonna need paint sticks a

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:01.800
Fernell lens that you can get at the dollar store a piece of cardboard and a few different types of hardware for assembling everything

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:04.378
These paint sticks you can pick up the local Lowe's or Home Depot

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.419
They're 99 cents for a pack of 10

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:12.449
The fern Elan's comes from the dollar store for a surprise a dollar and then each of these little hardware packets you pick up from

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.740
The hardware aisle and hardware store as well

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.680
They're about a dollar each you're gonna end up spending about six dollars on hardware

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.779
And that's gonna get you all sorts of machine screws the half-inch three-quarter inch and one and a quarter inch variety

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.780
You're also gonna get number eight flat washers some wing nuts and one in 5/8 inch eye bolts all of the hardware

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.549
we're using is number eight thirty to eight has to do with the size of the hardware and

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:38.639
32 is the amount of threads per inch it's also worth noting that with the 3/4 and the one and a quarter machine

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.990
bolts you only need two of each so if you want to go to a hardware store that sells them

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:45.359
Individually you might be able to save yourself a dollar or two

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.390
aside from that all we're gonna need is a little bit of wood glue some cardboard and

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:53.999
Drill a knife and a saw to put it all together. So we got all of our materials gathered up or a start building

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.680
We're gonna use the paint sticks and the fernell lens and begin by building a frame for the lens itself

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:32.950
So here's what we've just done

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.950
we use a folded piece of paper to mark the

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.430
45-degree angle on the paint sticks

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:41.529
And then cut out four long and four short ones to build the frame and just press that X we turn the paint stick so

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.820
That all the markings are on the same side and the notches line up with each other just makes it look a little bit better

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:50.499
And after we cut out the pieces of the frame you should end up with eight of these little triangles scraps that you want to

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.180
Hang on to because they're gonna be integral to the integrity of our frame now to finish the frame off

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.089
We're going to put a little bit of glue on the corners on both sides of the frame

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.710
We're then going to glue the 2 together with the front ends in between and then reinforce it with the screws

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:07.960
Alright guys we have the actual frame for the fern Ellen's complete things are looking really good

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:11.439
And I wanted to show you some of the things you need to take note of first of all for the fern L

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.020
Lens itself there's a very smooth side and if you flip it over

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:15.530
There's a ridge of the side

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:22.630
So you put your half-inch machine screws in put the rounded smooth side on the same smooth side as the fern ellen's itself everything ruff

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:26.529
should be sticking up out of the back you also notice that at the bottom and the top of the frame we put one and

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:32.170
a quarter inch machine screws those need to be as straight and upright as possible because those are going to be our Sun finders and

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:36.399
You'll see how they work in just a couple minutes all this left to do is attach the eye bolts so this thing can pivot

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.400
And then we'll build a stand

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:24.699
So here we have a guy's the stand is assembled and attached at this point our mini solar scorcher is just about complete

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:27.429
The other thing that's gonna be really helpful with your solar Scorchers

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:29.000
if you have some kind of a base or a

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.199
Platform that you can put things on in this case we just went down to the dollar store

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:34.419
And we picked up this piece of Ninja Turtle cardboard

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:37.718
we cut it to shape so that it fits right over the lens and

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:42.370
Cut some holes in the tops that actually fits over top of the bolts in the back as well now if you want to get

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:48.159
Fancy you can just take some aluminum foil some spray glue glue it all together and having that metal foil on there will actually make

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:50.159
It a little bit safer as well

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:14.010
Not only is the main solar sports are very convenient very easy to work with and made to sit on your desktop

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:14.940
It's also got some cool

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:20.160
Built-in features as well for example when you're outside and you want to find out the exact perfect angle of the Sun

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:24.450
These two bolts on the back act almost like an improvised Sun leveler

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:27.450
You basically just adjust the lens and maneuver the frame until the shadow

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:28.780
completely disappears

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:34.709
When there's no more shadow it means the Sun is perfectly lined up and when you found that perfect position just reached over and tighten

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:37.230
Up the wingnut, and it will hold the frame perfectly in place

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:41.550
We've also designed the mini solar scorcher to fold up flat for convenient easy storage

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:46.590
So now we got our mini solar scorcher set up 100% complete. Let's take it outside and test it out

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:47.820
all right guys

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:53.010
we are now outside and just to see what kind of power this thing has we're gonna try burning a number of different things and

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:57.689
Considering this is actually made out of paint sticks. I thought it might be fun to start off by burning a paint stick

00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:01.290
I'm kind of wondering like if you just make sure that's focused and

00:07:01.419 --> 00:07:06.329
Just come up to it slowly because you want to find the center point and then slowly bring it toward the scorcher

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:09.990
And alright when it hits that focus it starts burning

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:18.170
And there burst into flame

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:24.649
But yeah, there's how to start your survival fires man with a little desktop toy look at this down here

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:26.360
I mean you can see that beam of light

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:30.980
But it's definitely not focused if we start bringing the wood toward the focal point boom wow

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:36.320
That burst into flames in like one like instantly yeah

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:41.570
That's what the make a solar scorcher does the same thing let's see if we can do that again slowly bring it to a point

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:45.260
Right about there, and it bursts into flame. That is

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:47.220
absolutely insane

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:53.630
So make no mistake about it size in this case doesn't necessarily matter(thats what she said) because the solar scorcher is powerful

00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:57.830
That's crazy, so there's pretty cool guys. We got paint sticks to light on fire

00:07:57.830 --> 00:07:59.270
We got two-by-fours to light on fire

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:03.049
I was a little surprised that the paint sticks took longer to catch them the 2x4

00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:06.919
But I think it's cuz they were a lighter color, so they're reflecting more of the heat now

00:08:06.919 --> 00:08:10.849
We know this thing is working. Let's try lighting off other fun things like smoke powder

00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:13.460
firecrackers in the book of matches

00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:45.720
The smoke powder look great. We got lots of really cool colors. I especially liked on that last one

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:46.510
how it lit on fire

00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:52.860
Before it was even moved into the focal point it was still hot enough to light the smoke even though there was plenty of heat

00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:54.300
Left to add that was really cool

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:58.679
And the book of matches as soon as the focal point hit the match heads they all ignited

00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:01.680
And there's a little bit of a fireball flying off the sides of it it looked awesome

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:03.840
That was pretty cool alright so for one final experiment

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:07.920
I'm thinking why don't we just take it to the next level and try lighting off firecrackers for the win?

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:09.820
I'm actually really impressed the

00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:14.879
Aluminum foil seems to be holding up pretty well so even though we're using cardboard by coating it with a little metal foil

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:17.080
Seems to make it a little more durable

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:19.080
firecracker versus sunlight

00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:26.219
That was just good old-fashioned fun the thing I noticed there is we actually had to lift the base up so the fuse of the

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:28.230
Firework actually made it into the focal point of the Sun

00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:30.569
It looks like there was about a one to two inch

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:33.720
Disparity before there's enough sunlight to actually like to see you so this time

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:37.470
I'm gonna set a rock on top of it first and see if we can just slide it straight into the beam

00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:46.350
Hang so there you have a guy's mini solar scorcher for the win it takes down matches it takes down wood it even lights

00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:51.689
Fireworks how much cooler does it get and the best part is you can get all the materials from your local hardware store for under

00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:56.939
$10 so rather than getting one of those old TVs and dismantling it trying to use the giant Fornell lens and being

00:09:57.010 --> 00:10:00.720
Frustrated when it doesn't work you can have all of the same fun with none of the aggravation

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.230
Thanks for joining us for this product guys. We will be looking for you the next one. Talk to you then

00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:11.129
Well that even went into my workbench be careful you really will ignite the fire within

00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:17.700
Alright, that's enough
