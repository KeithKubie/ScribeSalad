00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
This brings us to the conclusion of Unit 5.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
We've seen several examples of authentication protocols

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and focused on TLS as the most widely-used protocol that's used for every secure web session.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
The first thing I hope you take away from this is that designing cryptographic protocols is really hard.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
The details matter and the way things are implemented matters.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
TLS is a protocol that's built on SSL that's been around for over 17 years.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
It still has new vulnerabilities being discovered

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and people learning new ways to exploit them.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
The other key lesson is attacks get better, they never get worse,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
even if the initial attack seems to be only theoretical and not be easy to exploit,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
there are often ways that clever people will figure out ways to exploit those attacks.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
In Unit 6, we'll look at other things you can do with cryptographic protocols.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
This unit focused all on authentication and communication,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
but there are lots and lots of other things we can do with cryptography.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Some of those are quite interesting, and I hope you'l be back for Unit 6 to learn about them.
