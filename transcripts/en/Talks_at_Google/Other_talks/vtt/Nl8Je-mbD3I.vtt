00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:11.360
MALE SPEAKER: Let me just
introduce our speaker today.

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.990
So we have Leslie Brunetta
who's an independent writer here

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:16.070
in Cambridge, who
has collaborated

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.210
with an evolutionary biologist
to understand spider silk.

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:21.210
And the reason she's
interested in spider silk

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.972
is not because she's
a crazy spider lady--

00:00:23.972 --> 00:00:25.268
LESLIE BRUNETTA: But now I am.

00:00:25.268 --> 00:00:27.040
MALE SPEAKER: But now she is.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:28.630
But because spiders
turned out to be

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.330
a great way of understanding
the process of evolution

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:32.840
and natural selection.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:33.410
So Leslie--

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:34.974
LESLIE BRUNETTA: I can hold
up the book and show it.

00:00:34.974 --> 00:00:35.451
MALE SPEAKER: Why
don't you tell us

00:00:35.451 --> 00:00:37.329
how you got
interested in spiders?

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:39.370
LESLIE BRUNETTA: How I
got interested in spiders.

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:40.770
I'm an English major.

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.100
I have a Master's in English.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.260
I have nothing past
high school science,

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.380
which puts me at a big
disadvantage in this room,

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:51.620
I suspect.

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:59.280
And what I was working for-- I
have written science articles

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.090
for various alumni
magazines, Tech Review,

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:07.570
and I wrote a kind
of joke commentary

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.050
on evolution-- human
evolution-- for NPR.

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:13.570
And I had had a couple of
NPR commentaries before,

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.310
and they said they would
take this commentary.

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.720
It was all about how
you, unfortunately,

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.640
can't throw four-year-old
kids into the pool,

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.350
and they just swim like dogs.

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.270
Whereas that's true about
apes, but not about monkeys.

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.950
So that's all interesting.

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.210
So they told me that they
would take the commentary

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:40.090
if I got it vetted by an
evolutionary scientist.

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.539
And I'm a freelancer.

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:43.830
So I, of course, said, oh, yes.

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:44.630
I will do that.

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.296
And then it was like,
hang up the phone.

00:01:46.296 --> 00:01:47.350
It was like, ahh!

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.250
I don't know any
evolutionary scientists.

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:50.333
How am I going to do this?

00:01:50.333 --> 00:01:53.632
My husband at the time worked
at the late, lamented Arthur D.

00:01:53.632 --> 00:01:55.060
Little.

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.737
And he worked with
somebody there.

00:01:57.737 --> 00:01:59.070
We had gone to branch with them.

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.528
And he said, what
about Bob's wife?

00:02:00.528 --> 00:02:03.650
I think she's an
evolutionary scientist.

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:05.950
So I called Bob's
wife, Kay, who--

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.020
Kay Craig, who's the
co-author Catherine L. Craig.

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:16.520
Turns out that she did some
really pioneering research

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.980
on the evolution of spider silk.

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:25.490
And she was nearly
finished with her monograph

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:28.030
and she just needed it
smoothed out a little bit.

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.820
So I said that I
would-- I have a copy

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.230
of her monograph over there,
if you want to see it.

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.850
So I was copy editing
her book, and they

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:38.700
were parts of it I
didn't understand.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.420
But what I suddenly realized
was that although I thought

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.380
I understood
evolution-- I mean, I

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.560
had been reading the
"Science Times" every Tuesday

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.010
since it started
publishing and all of that.

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.420
Although I thought I
understood evolution

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.250
and natural
selection, I realized

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.940
that I have these very,
very common misconceptions

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:59.780
about evolution and
natural selection.

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:05.010
This was right at the time when
the whole intelligent design

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.520
thing was really bubbling up.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.830
And I realized,
reading her book,

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.940
that you could use spiders and
the evolution of spider silk

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.480
to explain the
process of evolution

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.710
and the process of
natural selection

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:24.190
to non-biologists in a way
that would be extremely

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.000
difficult to do with any
other kind of organism.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.719
And, I mean, I'll
explain what-- so this

00:03:28.719 --> 00:03:30.510
will end up being a
little bit repetitive--

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:35.110
but it's because the silks
themselves are proteins.

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:38.560
And since the 1990s, they've
done genetic-- the genes

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.670
behind some of these proteins.

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:42.510
There's still a lot to go.

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:47.480
But it's very hard to
figure out the genetic basis

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.090
and the genetic evolution of,
let's say, bird flight, right?

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.460
Because it's very,
very complicated.

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:58.450
But what I'll show you
when we get this going

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:03.340
is that there's a sequential
evolution of spider silks.

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.870
Silks that they still use now.

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:09.630
And those can be examined
and characterized,

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:13.810
and so you can actually see
the genetic changes that

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:19.470
lead to functional changes
that then lead to an increased

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.149
chance of survival.

00:04:21.149 --> 00:04:24.750
So it turned out
that-- I thought

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.510
it wouldn't take me-- take us--
very long to write this book.

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:29.790
It ended up taking a lot
longer than I thought

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:32.820
it would, because I had
the hubris of most writers,

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.470
which is I didn't know
what I didn't know.

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:37.930
So I had to kind
of school myself

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:42.310
in evolutionary theory and
proteomics and genetics.

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:46.530
But anyway, it just turns out
that spiders are this fantastic

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:49.310
vehicle for explaining
evolution to non-biologists.

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:52.540
So that's the long story
of how I got into this.

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:58.580
So this kind of web, this is
properly known as an orb web.

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.300
And I would risk saying
that when most people think

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.320
of a spider web, this is
the kind of spider web

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:04.920
that they think of.

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:07.610
This one has been
dusted with cornstarch.

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:10.672
So usually when you see spider
webs that you could really

00:05:10.672 --> 00:05:12.130
see like this,
they've usually been

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:16.070
dusted with some kind of powder
so they can be photographed.

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:19.780
So to build an orb
web, a spider spins

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:21.970
a number of different
kinds of silk.

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:24.880
So there's one
kind of silk that's

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:28.920
in the frame lines
and the radial lines.

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:31.700
Then they use a silk--
a different kind

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:35.260
of silk-- to build a scaffold
to help them build it.

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.560
Then they eat that
while they lay down

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:41.490
a different kind of silk, which
is this, the capture spiral.

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:43.900
And then there are different
kinds of silk proteins

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:46.460
that are used, for instance,
to anchor the lines, to anchor

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:48.890
the lines to each other.

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:52.570
And there's also a glue--
protein silk glue--

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:53.850
that coats the capture line.

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:56.580
And each of these
silks is produced

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:59.520
in a different silk
gland in the spider.

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:03.520
So pretty clearly, this is
an amazing construction.

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:06.540
And as I've said
before, the book

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:08.450
itself is about two things.

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:11.700
One is the story of the
evolution of spider silk,

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:15.540
and-- I'm sorry over
there-- and the other one

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:19.820
is an explanation of what
natural selection really is

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:21.210
and how it really works.

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:24.440
Most people who are not
evolutionary biologists

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:26.700
have a lot of
misconceptions about that.

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:29.310
And it turns out that
spiders and their silks

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:32.750
offer an unusually
good view of this

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:38.830
because the silks are
proteins and the proteins--

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:41.080
all proteins are
dictated by genes.

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:44.230
And with today's
research techniques,

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:46.540
you can see how a
change in a silk gene

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:49.660
may lead to a change in
silk protein structure.

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:52.670
And we can then see
how the environment may

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:55.920
favor one protein
structure over another.

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:58.310
So for instance, you can
have a change in a silk gene

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:01.830
that may result in a silk
protein becoming stronger

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:04.240
or stretchier or stickier.

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:07.520
And the other thing
is that now we

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:11.440
are finding more and more not
just how different spiders

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:14.580
are related to each other--
there are over 40,000 known

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:16.080
species of spider.

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:18.430
We can not only see how
the species are related

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:21.970
to each other, we can now see
how the silk genes and the silk

00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:24.070
proteins are related
to each other

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:27.770
and descend from earlier
genes and proteins.

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:30.180
So what I'm going
to show you today,

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:33.850
I'm not going to go into the
deep gene and protein stuff.

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:36.010
But we do go into
it in the book.

00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:38.270
But I'm going to show you
some of the astounding

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:41.730
variety in the ways that
spider silks and silk

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:43.280
uses have evolved.

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:46.060
So that orb web is
pretty spectacular,

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:50.880
but that's really--
that's the least of it.

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:53.580
When spiders' ancestors
were evolving--

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:59.530
they began evolving about
380 to 400 million years ago.

00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:05.690
Back then, plants-- tallest
plants were about this tall.

00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:06.730
There were no birds.

00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:07.830
There were no mammals.

00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:09.120
There were no reptiles around.

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:12.280
But there were plenty of
very predatory arthropods.

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:15.870
So arthropods you probably
know are spiders, insects,

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:19.910
crustaceans, the things with
jointed legs and exoskeletons.

00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:23.710
So if you were
producing silk back

00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:27.070
then, what you might
want the silk for

00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:29.590
is something like this.

00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:32.980
These are a type of
spider called mesophiles.

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:39.250
There are three surviving
major lineages of spiders.

00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:42.090
These belong to the
oldest surviving lineage.

00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:44.840
They live only in
Southeast Asia.

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:48.920
They're pretty hard to find
and pretty hard to study.

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:51.390
You can see, very interesting
thing about them is that they

00:08:51.390 --> 00:08:58.320
have this segmented abdomen,
which other spiders don't.

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:04.100
And that shows you
their ancestry.

00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:07.050
And look how it's using silk.

00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:09.880
It has a burrow underground.

00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:12.780
So it hides out from its
predators in the burrow.

00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:17.200
It lines the burrow with silk,
which helps hold the walls up.

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:20.640
It also helps mediate humidity.

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:24.570
It uses silk to knit
together debris and create

00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:27.360
this flap-like trap door.

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:30.990
So most of the time, it
will be hiding in there

00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:33.290
and will actually be
holding the door shut.

00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:36.780
So that defends it
against its predators.

00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:38.570
Then this particular
kind of species--

00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:42.660
and a bunch of other ones--
set out these silk trip lines.

00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:45.169
And these are nocturnal,
which also makes sense,

00:09:45.169 --> 00:09:47.585
if you think of plants only
being this tall, because there

00:09:47.585 --> 00:09:49.620
was very little shade.

00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:52.800
What they do is they hang out
on the edge of the burrow.

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:55.610
They array their legs
along the trip lines.

00:09:55.610 --> 00:09:58.110
And then when anything walks
by and they feel the vibration,

00:09:58.110 --> 00:10:00.780
they lunge out, grab the
prey with their fangs,

00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:05.480
and drag it back into the burrow
and close the flap and eat it.

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:11.830
So there are about 90 species--
90 known species-- of these.

00:10:11.830 --> 00:10:15.650
As far as they're concerned,
insects never evolved flight.

00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:17.630
They're just fine
in their burrows.

00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:19.810
So the second major
lineage of spiders

00:10:19.810 --> 00:10:21.680
is known as the mygalomorphs.

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:24.520
The mygalomorphs include the
tarantulas and their closer

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:25.470
relatives.

00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:27.510
The oldest known--
oh, I should have

00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:31.000
said that this is very similar.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.710
These are like the coelacanths
of the spider world.

00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:38.960
They are very similar
to fossil mesophiles

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:42.150
from 290 million years ago.

00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:49.280
The oldest mygalomorph fossil
is about 240 million years old.

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:50.703
By then-- do you have a-- yep?

00:10:50.703 --> 00:10:51.328
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:10:51.328 --> 00:10:52.744
I was wondering
whether, as you go

00:10:52.744 --> 00:10:54.566
through all the
various species--

00:10:54.566 --> 00:10:57.554
I assume there's going to
be [INAUDIBLE] or something.

00:10:57.554 --> 00:11:00.542
I'd just be curious to know
what proportion of them

00:11:00.542 --> 00:11:01.538
are actually poisonous.

00:11:01.538 --> 00:11:03.050
Like, are any of
these poisonous?

00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:05.130
LESLIE BRUNETTA:
Well, it depends

00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:06.640
on what you mean by poisonous.

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:08.880
They're all venomous.

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:10.930
So if you mean
sort of medically--

00:11:10.930 --> 00:11:16.140
I think they call it medically
interesting or medically

00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:20.490
significant, very,
very few spiders

00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:22.420
are medically significant.

00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:26.830
And it seems like the bulk
of those are in Australia.

00:11:26.830 --> 00:11:30.200
Black widows are
medically significant.

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:34.390
Recluses-- however, it turns
out that most reported recluse

00:11:34.390 --> 00:11:38.490
bites are actually
MRSA infections and not

00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:39.370
spider bites.

00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:42.000
Spiders very, very
rarely bite people.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.740
Most things that are
reported as spider bites

00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:46.172
are not spider bites.

00:11:46.172 --> 00:11:47.838
AUDIENCE: OK, but
you're saying that all

00:11:47.838 --> 00:11:51.279
use some chemical to
paralyze or kill their pray.

00:11:51.279 --> 00:11:52.320
LESLIE BRUNETTA: Exactly.

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:58.790
For a long time, it was thought
that these didn't have venom.

00:11:58.790 --> 00:12:05.250
And so it was thought that
venom system evolved later.

00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:07.130
But this is one of
these things where

00:12:07.130 --> 00:12:11.300
the better instrumentation
you get changes knowledge.

00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:15.220
With much better, I think,
electron microscopes

00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:19.730
or some kind of
imaging, just last year,

00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:22.040
they discovered venom pores
in the fangs of these.

00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:27.610
So anyway, by the time that
the mygalomorphs evolved

00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:30.970
about 240 million years ago--
they evolved before that,

00:12:30.970 --> 00:12:34.410
but that's the oldest fossil--
there were tall plants.

00:12:34.410 --> 00:12:36.670
There were climbing
and flying insects,

00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:38.450
and there were also
increasing numbers

00:12:38.450 --> 00:12:40.720
of amphibians and reptiles.

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:44.010
And so in some of
the oldest surviving

00:12:44.010 --> 00:12:46.934
branches of the mygalomorphs,
we see silk use like this.

00:12:46.934 --> 00:12:48.100
This is called a collar web.

00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:50.770
These are also nocturnal.

00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:53.130
So there's a silk-lined
burrow under the ground.

00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:55.200
They build it up about an inch.

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:57.720
They build a silk up,
knit debris into it.

00:12:57.720 --> 00:12:59.430
And during the
day, it's flexible.

00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:01.820
During the day
they close it shut.

00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:04.210
And then at night,
they open it up

00:13:04.210 --> 00:13:05.890
and hang out here
and wait to feel

00:13:05.890 --> 00:13:07.490
the vibration of their prey.

00:13:07.490 --> 00:13:09.040
So that's a collar web.

00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:11.250
This is a turret web.

00:13:11.250 --> 00:13:15.790
Similar, very similar idea,
but maybe two inches tall.

00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:20.220
Again, you see the
debris knit into it.

00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:24.770
So this-- mostly, it's
defense from predators.

00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:30.320
But actually, you have to--
I've become a bit adept

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:31.990
at thinking at spider scale.

00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:34.960
You have to start seeing
the world at spider scale.

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:36.650
That's only about
two inches tall,

00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:38.810
but compared to being
underground in a burrow,

00:13:38.810 --> 00:13:42.330
that really increases
your sensory field

00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:44.930
when what you're
sensing is vibration.

00:13:44.930 --> 00:13:49.660
And so this takes
advantage of insects

00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:51.620
who have an instinct to climb.

00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:55.290
And also occasionally flying
insects will land on the debris

00:13:55.290 --> 00:13:56.170
and they'll come out.

00:13:56.170 --> 00:13:59.702
AUDIENCE: How numerous are
constructions like this?

00:13:59.702 --> 00:14:01.160
Like if you walk
through the woods,

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:02.220
will you see dozens
and dozens of these?

00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:03.980
LESLIE BRUNETTA:
Well, it depends.

00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:09.910
Well, if you really went
looking for them-- these kinds

00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:12.130
of spiders,
mygalomorphs in general,

00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:15.290
will tend-- and mesophiles,
actually, if you find one,

00:14:15.290 --> 00:14:16.370
you'll find more.

00:14:16.370 --> 00:14:18.400
Because they don't go far.

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:20.300
They can't disperse,
which I'll get to,

00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:22.630
but they can't
disperse very far.

00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:24.260
How common are they?

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:27.610
Not tremendously
common, but not uncommon

00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:29.320
if you're in the right place.

00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:33.977
So actually, these, which
are purse web spiders,

00:14:33.977 --> 00:14:36.060
apparently if you know
where to look on Cape Cod--

00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:38.860
I've never seen one, but if you
know where to look in Cape Cod,

00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:40.810
you can find these.

00:14:40.810 --> 00:14:44.100
You can get the scale of
this from this oak leaf here.

00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:46.550
So this is a sapling.

00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:49.590
And here is the purse web.

00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:52.020
So it's essentially
a closed silk tube.

00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:55.100
There's a silk-lined
underground burrow.

00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:58.650
And then what the spider does
is hang out in this tube.

00:14:58.650 --> 00:15:00.520
It's very sensitive
to any vibration.

00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:02.490
So for instance, if
a beetle crawls up

00:15:02.490 --> 00:15:05.130
here or a fly lands
on here, the spider

00:15:05.130 --> 00:15:07.810
will rush to that
space-- this is

00:15:07.810 --> 00:15:10.720
kind of like parchment
texture-- plunge

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:13.040
its fangs through,
grab the prey,

00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:16.290
bring it inside, rush down
into the burrow for safety.

00:15:16.290 --> 00:15:20.690
And then later it'll come back
and knit this back together.

00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:26.070
So what you can see is
this looks like things

00:15:26.070 --> 00:15:28.880
are progressing, right?

00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:31.460
You now have taller
trees and flying insects,

00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:33.560
and the mygalomorphs
are clearly starting

00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:36.620
to use silk to reach upward.

00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:42.260
But what you find out is
that's not how evolution works.

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:44.360
It's not going in any
particular direction.

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:44.860
Yes?

00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:46.110
AUDIENCE: How long are those?

00:15:46.110 --> 00:15:50.190
LESLIE BRUNETTA: They would
be about maybe six inches.

00:15:50.190 --> 00:15:53.550
This is a more recently
evolved mygalomorph species.

00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:56.220
And you see that it's
gone back to the burrow

00:15:56.220 --> 00:15:58.950
with the trapdoor.

00:15:58.950 --> 00:16:00.890
You see the silk lining.

00:16:00.890 --> 00:16:04.430
You see the silk door.

00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:08.520
And then there are
other mygalomorphs

00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:10.410
who make burrows with no doors.

00:16:10.410 --> 00:16:12.060
There are some who
make funnel webs,

00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:16.530
which are kind of sheets of
silk with a little funnel-shaped

00:16:16.530 --> 00:16:17.092
retreat.

00:16:17.092 --> 00:16:18.550
There are some that
make these sort

00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:21.960
of disorganized but
lacy-looking sheets.

00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:25.790
And some of these sheet webs
can-- they're not adhesive.

00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:28.070
They can slow
down-- it'd be kind

00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:30.770
of like walking on
a slack trampoline.

00:16:30.770 --> 00:16:32.310
So they slow down prey.

00:16:32.310 --> 00:16:35.470
Some can entangle prey, but
they're not actually adhesive.

00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:39.135
Yes?

00:16:39.135 --> 00:16:41.610
AUDIENCE: So several of these
have moving parts, right?

00:16:41.610 --> 00:16:44.162
And you said there's one
that tore through parchment,

00:16:44.162 --> 00:16:45.870
and it would just
catch stuff afterwards.

00:16:45.870 --> 00:16:47.471
The rest of them,
do any of them seem

00:16:47.471 --> 00:16:50.920
to be the silk is so complicated
use a mechanical kind of thing,

00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:53.570
or just the spider pushes
the door out of the way?

00:16:53.570 --> 00:16:55.970
LESLIE BRUNETTA: Yeah.

00:16:55.970 --> 00:17:00.020
Later evolution, there are
some mechanical things.

00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:01.120
Yes.

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:02.880
That, and there's a
lot more than that.

00:17:06.829 --> 00:17:08.119
But what now?

00:17:08.119 --> 00:17:08.619
Let's see.

00:17:08.619 --> 00:17:09.500
So what-- oh, I know.

00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:12.220
So what I was going to say is,
you know the very common thing

00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:15.130
of a spider dropping
on a thread?

00:17:15.130 --> 00:17:18.300
None of these spiders that we've
looked at so far can do that.

00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:21.680
Because none of them can
produce major ampullate silk.

00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:26.430
And major ampullate silk
is that drag line silk.

00:17:26.430 --> 00:17:28.580
Still, even though none
of them can do that,

00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:31.480
there are 90 known
species of the mesophiles.

00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:34.250
There are over three
thousand known species

00:17:34.250 --> 00:17:37.550
of these various mygalomorphs.

00:17:37.550 --> 00:17:40.970
So evolving at
around the same time,

00:17:40.970 --> 00:17:44.020
but in a different
direction, are the bunch

00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:46.310
of spiders known as--
the lineage of spiders

00:17:46.310 --> 00:17:49.010
known as the araneomorphs.

00:17:49.010 --> 00:17:51.640
They can all make this silk
that I'm talking about,

00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:53.570
which is called
major ampullate silk.

00:17:53.570 --> 00:17:55.670
This is the silk that
you hear about when

00:17:55.670 --> 00:17:59.890
you hear about spider silk
being stronger than steel.

00:17:59.890 --> 00:18:02.220
That's this kind of spider silk.

00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:05.980
None of this kind of silk
is stronger than steel.

00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:11.170
So major ampullate silk,
that's what they hang on.

00:18:11.170 --> 00:18:15.020
That's what allowed spiders to
move out into the air space.

00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:21.150
So, for instance, this is
known as a lamp shade web.

00:18:21.150 --> 00:18:24.250
This is made by one of
the earliest evolved

00:18:24.250 --> 00:18:28.220
but still surviving
araneomorphs.

00:18:28.220 --> 00:18:30.890
And what you see
here-- so this again

00:18:30.890 --> 00:18:34.380
has been dusted, so it
looks a little bit strange.

00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:38.890
So what you can't see is
back inside the lamp shade,

00:18:38.890 --> 00:18:42.810
there is a silk mat
that's laid down first.

00:18:42.810 --> 00:18:46.870
Then the spider spins.

00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:49.820
So arachnologists have
their own use of words.

00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:53.420
Spinning means that the
spider uses its legs

00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:55.330
to pull the silk
out of its body.

00:18:55.330 --> 00:18:57.240
The mesophiles and
the mygalomorphs

00:18:57.240 --> 00:19:00.710
will glue down the silk
and then walk away from it.

00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:03.240
The araneomorphs pull the
silk out with their legs.

00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:05.720
So technically, that's spinning.

00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:09.690
So it will spin these lines--
these major ampullate lines.

00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:12.709
Because of the tensile
strength of the lines,

00:19:12.709 --> 00:19:14.500
you can see that this,
compared to anything

00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:16.510
you've seen previously,
has a lot more space

00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:17.920
between the lines.

00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:22.750
And then they guide out
the shape in this way.

00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:24.850
You can't see it,
and I'll explain why,

00:19:24.850 --> 00:19:30.890
but there is an opposing
cone of lines this way.

00:19:30.890 --> 00:19:32.290
But what do you really see here?

00:19:32.290 --> 00:19:34.350
What you really
see is the spider

00:19:34.350 --> 00:19:37.920
is doing what the earlier
evolved spiders did.

00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:39.450
This is essentially
a burrow that's

00:19:39.450 --> 00:19:41.230
been brought out underground.

00:19:41.230 --> 00:19:44.910
The spider hides out inside
that from its predators.

00:19:44.910 --> 00:19:47.870
The lines deter its predators.

00:19:47.870 --> 00:19:51.360
But the biggest
advantage, and probably

00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:57.140
the reason leading to the
evolution of major ampullate

00:19:57.140 --> 00:20:00.480
silk, is that if things get
too hairy with the predator,

00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:02.460
they can dive out on
their safety line.

00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:10.100
So it allows you to--
oh, now, the powder

00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:16.840
here is adhering to another
araneomorph innovation called

00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:18.490
cribellate silk.

00:20:18.490 --> 00:20:21.500
So the araneomorph
spiders will lay down

00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:25.450
the major ampullate catching
lines, and at the same time,

00:20:25.450 --> 00:20:27.080
they have a spinning
organ called

00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:32.480
a cribellum that emits
tiny fibrils of silk.

00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:36.050
They are so fine that it
takes about 4,000 of them

00:20:36.050 --> 00:20:37.920
to equal a human hair.

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:41.790
And as they're laying
it down on this line,

00:20:41.790 --> 00:20:44.400
they use a special comb of
hairs on their back legs

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:48.710
to kind of tease it back like
a Jackie Kennedy bouffant,

00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:49.550
like this.

00:20:49.550 --> 00:20:53.800
And you end up with
these waves of silk

00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:56.050
that are so fine that
you get van der Waals

00:20:56.050 --> 00:21:00.880
forces between the
silk and the molecules

00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:04.710
and the exoskeleton
of their prey.

00:21:04.710 --> 00:21:08.360
So that's all pretty innovative.

00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:10.730
And you can see where
that allows spiders

00:21:10.730 --> 00:21:15.210
to go to-- they've created this
completely new niche, right?

00:21:15.210 --> 00:21:16.930
So major ampullate
silk, it allows

00:21:16.930 --> 00:21:18.180
you to drop out of harm's way.

00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:20.590
That's probably its
biggest benefit.

00:21:20.590 --> 00:21:23.170
But it also opened
up new opportunities,

00:21:23.170 --> 00:21:27.600
which is that it allows
you to hang silk-- sorry--

00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:30.540
hang silk across wider gaps.

00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:33.230
And it's very
strong, so it allows

00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:36.400
you to hang heavy webs
across those gaps.

00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:40.200
But the other thing it
allows you to do is--

00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:42.420
you'll know this if you
read "Charlotte's Web"--

00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:45.650
it also allows you to fly,
if you're an araneomorph

00:21:45.650 --> 00:21:46.930
spiderling.

00:21:46.930 --> 00:21:49.230
The problem with
being a spiderling

00:21:49.230 --> 00:21:52.130
is that your siblings
and you are cannibals.

00:21:52.130 --> 00:21:57.790
So you want to
disperse fairly early.

00:21:57.790 --> 00:22:02.410
And araneomorphs
spiderlings disperse--

00:22:02.410 --> 00:22:04.579
I told you the
arachnologists have

00:22:04.579 --> 00:22:05.870
a lot of these technical terms.

00:22:05.870 --> 00:22:07.630
The technical term for
what this spider is doing

00:22:07.630 --> 00:22:08.463
is called tiptoeing.

00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:14.800
It'll find a high point,
go on the tips of its legs,

00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:17.560
and then put its hind
end up into the air

00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:20.370
and start releasing
major ampullate silk.

00:22:20.370 --> 00:22:22.900
And it can actually
sense air currents

00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:25.090
on the bristles on its body.

00:22:25.090 --> 00:22:27.980
And eventually, under
the right conditions,

00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:32.710
they'll get enough lift from the
silk that they'll be lifted up.

00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:37.270
Some of them will
just fail, and they'll

00:22:37.270 --> 00:22:38.780
go just a couple of feet.

00:22:38.780 --> 00:22:40.520
And who knows what
will happen to them.

00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:44.190
But there are documented--
many, many documented-- cases

00:22:44.190 --> 00:22:47.140
of lots of them being
whisked way up into the air

00:22:47.140 --> 00:22:50.350
and going kilometers.

00:22:50.350 --> 00:22:53.940
You probably know about
the explosion on Krakatoa.

00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:56.360
One of the first people
to go back to Krakatoa,

00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:59.970
the place was just
baked sterile.

00:22:59.970 --> 00:23:01.370
But there was a spider there.

00:23:01.370 --> 00:23:04.000
And that's how-- I mean,
I'm sure it didn't survive,

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.140
but this is how the
spider got there.

00:23:09.370 --> 00:23:11.280
So by now, maybe,
you're thinking, OK.

00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:12.647
They're making this silk.

00:23:12.647 --> 00:23:13.980
They're stringing up these webs.

00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:15.770
So probably we get
to the vertical orb

00:23:15.770 --> 00:23:17.020
web, which I showed you first.

00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:19.480
But that's not true.

00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:23.440
Because orb webs
include that spiral

00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:25.450
capture silk that I showed you.

00:23:25.450 --> 00:23:28.830
Most araneomorphs, the
majority of araneomorphs,

00:23:28.830 --> 00:23:32.220
cannot make that
capture spiral silk.

00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:37.430
So instead, they're
making webs like this,

00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:40.620
which is just a sort of
radiating web out of a crevice.

00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:42.680
Funnel web, again,
coming out, usually,

00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:44.790
of a crevice of some sort.

00:23:44.790 --> 00:23:46.640
Suspended sheet webs.

00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:49.000
And these are called ray webs.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:54.850
And anywhere that you see
the powder sticking to them,

00:23:54.850 --> 00:23:57.300
that's where there's
that cribellate silk.

00:23:57.300 --> 00:24:00.880
The other lines are
not catching silks.

00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:04.350
And they're also making
silk constructions

00:24:04.350 --> 00:24:06.810
like this, which
we, unfortunately,

00:24:06.810 --> 00:24:08.400
don't have these.

00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:11.650
This is the European
water spider.

00:24:11.650 --> 00:24:12.990
They live in ponds.

00:24:12.990 --> 00:24:15.530
And that's just
sort of pond weed.

00:24:15.530 --> 00:24:20.560
And so what they do is they
dive down from the surface.

00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:27.640
They construct a major
ampullate silk sheet.

00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:31.150
Then the silvery stuff
on the spider's body,

00:24:31.150 --> 00:24:35.234
those are air bubbles adhering
to the bristles on their body.

00:24:35.234 --> 00:24:36.650
So when they go
up to the surface,

00:24:36.650 --> 00:24:37.830
the air sticks to them.

00:24:37.830 --> 00:24:42.010
Then they swim down, and
then they brush the air off

00:24:42.010 --> 00:24:43.270
under the sheet.

00:24:43.270 --> 00:24:45.610
And then the air
collects up in the sheet.

00:24:45.610 --> 00:24:48.910
And they keep doing
that until they produce,

00:24:48.910 --> 00:24:51.150
essentially, a diving bell.

00:24:51.150 --> 00:24:53.740
And the female will actually
lay her eggs in there,

00:24:53.740 --> 00:24:55.250
and the spiderlings
will hatch out

00:24:55.250 --> 00:24:58.284
in there dry and then swim out.

00:24:58.284 --> 00:24:58.784
Yeah.

00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:05.180
But then at the
same time, you've

00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:08.480
also got thousands of species--
thousands and thousands

00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:11.890
of species of araneomorphs that
just don't make any web at all.

00:25:11.890 --> 00:25:15.660
And they've instead-- they've
gone back to trap door burrows,

00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:19.440
like the wolf spiders, if you're
familiar with wolf spiders.

00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:22.100
They are araneomorphs,
but they live in burrows.

00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:24.410
The Huntsman spiders,
which run around.

00:25:24.410 --> 00:25:30.980
Or in fact, the most
diverse spider family of all

00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:32.380
are the jumping spiders.

00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:36.100
There are about 5,000 known
species of jumping spiders.

00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:38.352
If you look very-- it's
hard to see on this,

00:25:38.352 --> 00:25:39.810
but if you look
very carefully, you

00:25:39.810 --> 00:25:42.970
can see the safety line
coming from the back

00:25:42.970 --> 00:25:44.910
of-- the major ampullate
safety line coming

00:25:44.910 --> 00:25:48.300
from the back of the spider.

00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:51.504
They don't always
hit their target.

00:25:51.504 --> 00:25:53.670
Probably most the time,
they don't hit their target,

00:25:53.670 --> 00:25:56.090
but they're saved by their
major ampullate line.

00:25:56.090 --> 00:25:58.010
They can also use the
major ampullate line

00:25:58.010 --> 00:26:00.750
to kind of control
their direction

00:26:00.750 --> 00:26:03.730
as they come close
to their target.

00:26:03.730 --> 00:26:05.910
So all of these
ways of negotiating

00:26:05.910 --> 00:26:08.530
with the environment
are in different ways

00:26:08.530 --> 00:26:11.440
enabled by major ampullate silk.

00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:16.800
So not finally, which I'll
get to, you have the orb web.

00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:21.240
But all the evidence
that we have so far

00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:24.310
is that orb webs,
which we usually

00:26:24.310 --> 00:26:26.590
think of as being
vertical, first

00:26:26.590 --> 00:26:28.790
evolved as horizontal
structures.

00:26:28.790 --> 00:26:31.580
So you're actually
looking down on this.

00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:34.720
What I've found since
doing this book,

00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:36.320
it really changes your habits.

00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:39.830
I now have noticed that next
to a lot of utility poles,

00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:42.790
for some reason there's
like an empty steel pole.

00:26:42.790 --> 00:26:44.420
A lot of times if
you look in those,

00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:47.065
you'll see a horizontal orb web.

00:26:47.065 --> 00:26:48.440
And what they're
doing is they're

00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:51.690
taking advantage of
insects hatching out

00:26:51.690 --> 00:26:55.210
in there and their
instinct to fly up.

00:26:55.210 --> 00:26:55.710
Yes?

00:26:55.710 --> 00:26:58.955
AUDIENCE: What's the evidence
that the horizontal one evolved

00:26:58.955 --> 00:26:59.454
first?

00:26:59.454 --> 00:27:02.740
Like, I can't see how the
fossil record would show that.

00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:05.960
LESLIE BRUNETTA: You can't
tell by the fossil record,

00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:10.130
but because there are so many
living species of spider,

00:27:10.130 --> 00:27:13.750
you can do all this sort
of taxonomy on them.

00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:14.250
Yeah.

00:27:14.250 --> 00:27:15.460
AUDIENCE: So it's a
phylogenetic tree?

00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:16.501
LESLIE BRUNETTA: Exactly.

00:27:16.501 --> 00:27:17.630
Exactly.

00:27:17.630 --> 00:27:21.170
So but what's different about
this from a vertical orb

00:27:21.170 --> 00:27:25.570
web is the catching
spiral is a different silk

00:27:25.570 --> 00:27:27.790
protein from the
vertical orb webs.

00:27:27.790 --> 00:27:32.190
And what you see here,
the adhesive on it,

00:27:32.190 --> 00:27:34.760
is-- not adhesive,
its van der Waals

00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:38.770
force-- it's the cribellate
silk, not the sticky glue

00:27:38.770 --> 00:27:41.390
that we see on the
vertical orb webs.

00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:50.050
It seems there's a
little bit of an evidence

00:27:50.050 --> 00:27:50.930
shift at the moment.

00:27:50.930 --> 00:27:55.870
It's very clear that
these evolved first.

00:27:55.870 --> 00:27:59.670
We thought that--
we think, and most

00:27:59.670 --> 00:28:02.960
of the evidence at the moment
says that the vertical orb

00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:06.390
webs and the horizontal orb
webs have a very recent--

00:28:06.390 --> 00:28:09.650
that's their most
recent common ancestor.

00:28:09.650 --> 00:28:15.070
It may turn out that these
are slightly cousins, that it

00:28:15.070 --> 00:28:18.380
evolved first, but there
was a shift and somebody

00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:23.439
is actually-- there's some
postulation that this structure

00:28:23.439 --> 00:28:24.980
may have evolved
and then disappeared

00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:27.720
and then re-evolved, which,
for instance, happens

00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:28.730
with the burrows.

00:28:28.730 --> 00:28:31.720
So I'll be really interested
to see what happens with that.

00:28:35.210 --> 00:28:38.050
So we get to the
vertical orb web.

00:28:38.050 --> 00:28:41.899
So this is a piece of
capture spiral line.

00:28:41.899 --> 00:28:42.398
Yes?

00:28:42.398 --> 00:28:44.270
AUDIENCE: For the
horizontal webs.

00:28:44.270 --> 00:28:46.142
Would humans find those sticky?

00:28:46.142 --> 00:28:48.010
Or because it's only
van der Waals forces,

00:28:48.010 --> 00:28:50.717
is it [INAUDIBLE]?

00:28:50.717 --> 00:28:52.800
LESLIE BRUNETTA: It doesn't
stick in the same way.

00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:53.300
Yeah.

00:28:56.360 --> 00:29:02.370
So this is a piece of
vertical orb web capture

00:29:02.370 --> 00:29:08.720
spiral in a piece of amber
that's 130 million years old.

00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:09.440
Yeah.

00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:13.340
So there's the line you can see.

00:29:13.340 --> 00:29:17.740
And then the droplets are this
protein glue, aggregate silk

00:29:17.740 --> 00:29:19.400
protein glue.

00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:20.990
The spider lays
it down in a coat.

00:29:20.990 --> 00:29:23.650
But because of the chemical
makeup of the glue,

00:29:23.650 --> 00:29:25.010
it beads up like that.

00:29:25.010 --> 00:29:27.204
So when you see
sparkles on the webs,

00:29:27.204 --> 00:29:29.620
sometimes what you're seeing
is water, but a lot of times,

00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:32.850
this is what you're seeing.

00:29:32.850 --> 00:29:34.630
So the interesting
thing about this

00:29:34.630 --> 00:29:38.800
is this means that spiders first
began to build vertical orb

00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:41.500
webs back when the
dinosaurs were around,

00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:43.250
which seems like an
awfully long time ago.

00:29:43.250 --> 00:29:45.910
But that's really late
in spider evolution.

00:29:45.910 --> 00:29:49.680
I mean, that's 250 million
years into the story

00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:52.560
of spider evolution.

00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:54.357
So as I said, these
have the qualities

00:29:54.357 --> 00:29:55.690
that I mentioned of the orb web.

00:29:55.690 --> 00:29:58.360
The other thing about them is
these are the first spiders

00:29:58.360 --> 00:30:01.280
to hang their webs out
in direct sunlight.

00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:04.102
And as a result--
well, not as a result,

00:30:04.102 --> 00:30:05.560
but associated with
that, they have

00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:07.270
interesting optical qualities.

00:30:07.270 --> 00:30:10.270
So if we get to Q&amp;A, somebody
should ask why insects still

00:30:10.270 --> 00:30:14.760
fly into these things
after 130 million years.

00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:17.780
And the evolution
of this new silk

00:30:17.780 --> 00:30:22.010
correlates with another
explosion in species.

00:30:22.010 --> 00:30:25.080
So like I said, the mesophiles
have about 90 species.

00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:29.270
The mygalomorphs, there
are about 3,000 species.

00:30:29.270 --> 00:30:36.280
The araneomorphs, there are
now about 39,000 species.

00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:40.320
And within the
araneomorphs, this section

00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:42.840
of spiders, if you
want to call them that,

00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:47.040
outnumbers their closest
relatives by about 10 to 1.

00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:53.280
So clearly, what they've done is
that they've gone out, created

00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:54.120
new niches.

00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:56.190
They were able to move
farther out in branches.

00:30:56.190 --> 00:30:58.270
And also, especially,
they are catching

00:30:58.270 --> 00:31:01.500
new prey, which is
fast, flying insects.

00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:09.140
So if you were like me before I
started working on all of this,

00:31:09.140 --> 00:31:10.940
one of the
misconceptions I had was

00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:14.510
that there are these kind
of like acmes of evolution,

00:31:14.510 --> 00:31:15.940
that the orb web was like this.

00:31:15.940 --> 00:31:18.840
And I have evidence that I'm not
the only one who thought this,

00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:22.460
because there was a cover
story about those-- the goats

00:31:22.460 --> 00:31:26.930
that they were trying to get to
make spider silk which they're

00:31:26.930 --> 00:31:28.150
still working on.

00:31:28.150 --> 00:31:32.950
There was a cover story in
the "Times Magazine" in 2001.

00:31:32.950 --> 00:31:35.350
And part of the story
talked about how

00:31:35.350 --> 00:31:37.210
spiders used to do
all sorts of things.

00:31:37.210 --> 00:31:39.460
And then they started
making the orb web,

00:31:39.460 --> 00:31:42.320
and the rest of the
spiders all disappeared.

00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:45.820
Clearly not true.

00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:49.800
But in addition to
another piece of proof

00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:51.755
that there is not an
acme of adaptation.

00:31:51.755 --> 00:31:53.800
I mean, the orb web
is pretty amazing.

00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:57.270
But the cobweb, which most
people think is just really

00:31:57.270 --> 00:32:00.480
kind of a mess,
in common parlance

00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:02.860
is more advanced
than the orb web.

00:32:02.860 --> 00:32:06.160
It evolved after the cobweb.

00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:08.340
It derives-- I
mean, the orb web.

00:32:08.340 --> 00:32:10.860
It derives from the orb web.

00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:15.140
And the evidence seems
to show that it evolved

00:32:15.140 --> 00:32:17.580
through natural
selection as a response

00:32:17.580 --> 00:32:22.410
to the evolution of
spider-hunting wasps.

00:32:22.410 --> 00:32:26.110
Spiders' biggest
predators are wasps.

00:32:26.110 --> 00:32:31.000
It's really a horrible story
what wasps do to spiders.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:34.730
They catch them, paralyze
them, lay their egg in them,

00:32:34.730 --> 00:32:37.100
and then the larvae
comes out and eats

00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:41.538
the still-living,
paralyzed spider.

00:32:41.538 --> 00:32:43.290
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:43.290 --> 00:32:44.800
LESLIE BRUNETTA: Yes, exactly.

00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:48.190
So what you've got here
is you've essentially

00:32:48.190 --> 00:32:50.570
got sort of a silk shark cage.

00:32:50.570 --> 00:32:53.460
That little orange spot
in there is the spider.

00:32:53.460 --> 00:32:55.480
Do you see it?

00:32:55.480 --> 00:32:56.420
That's the spider.

00:32:56.420 --> 00:32:59.490
So it's essentially
in this shark cage.

00:32:59.490 --> 00:33:02.120
And then the other interesting
feature of these webs

00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:07.260
is called a gum foot line, which
are these lines coming down.

00:33:07.260 --> 00:33:09.300
They're glued down here.

00:33:09.300 --> 00:33:11.680
And obviously,
they're under tension.

00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:15.600
And so what happens is that
if prey walks by and severs

00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:17.900
that glue connection there,
they stick to this line

00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:21.250
and get flung up to the spider.

00:33:21.250 --> 00:33:25.540
So in addition to the
protective advantage of this,

00:33:25.540 --> 00:33:28.350
there's also the
advantage that they

00:33:28.350 --> 00:33:32.950
can capture not just flying
prey, but also walking prey.

00:33:32.950 --> 00:33:37.280
So just to sum up all of this
and what we've seen here.

00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:40.270
So as I said, I'm
not a biologist.

00:33:40.270 --> 00:33:43.330
But I've really come
to feel that it's

00:33:43.330 --> 00:33:45.720
more and more important
for non-biologists

00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:47.220
to understand at
least the really

00:33:47.220 --> 00:33:50.960
basic concepts of evolution.

00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:53.940
It has a big
understanding in terms--

00:33:53.940 --> 00:33:58.930
a big impact in how you do or do
not understand global warming.

00:33:58.930 --> 00:34:00.990
All sorts of
ecological questions.

00:34:00.990 --> 00:34:03.400
I mean, for instance,
as you learn

00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:04.930
this and the scale
of this history,

00:34:04.930 --> 00:34:06.346
you understand
that there's really

00:34:06.346 --> 00:34:08.020
no such thing as a
balance of nature.

00:34:08.020 --> 00:34:11.429
Things are never
really in balance.

00:34:11.429 --> 00:34:15.639
Evolutionary concepts have a big
impact on biomedical questions,

00:34:15.639 --> 00:34:18.780
including cancer and
the treatment of cancer.

00:34:18.780 --> 00:34:21.920
And I have come to
think that spiders

00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:26.159
are kind of the vehicle
for explaining evolution

00:34:26.159 --> 00:34:27.610
to non-biologists.

00:34:27.610 --> 00:34:30.560
So just for instance, I
learned that contrary to my gut

00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:34.989
feelings, natural selection is
not some knockout competition

00:34:34.989 --> 00:34:37.199
like we saw with Brazil
and Germany yesterday.

00:34:41.139 --> 00:34:42.650
There isn't just one winner.

00:34:42.650 --> 00:34:45.170
There isn't any acme adaptation.

00:34:45.170 --> 00:34:48.497
There is, in fact, no such
thing as being perfectly adapted

00:34:48.497 --> 00:34:49.330
to your environment.

00:34:49.330 --> 00:34:52.480
I mean, the orb web
is really amazing.

00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:56.190
It doesn't help spiders
avoid spider-eating wasps.

00:34:56.190 --> 00:35:00.940
So everything is much, much more
fluid than we tend to perceive.

00:35:00.940 --> 00:35:03.570
Orb webs and cobwebs are
excellent at catching flying

00:35:03.570 --> 00:35:07.200
insects, but the mesophiles are
still fine in their burrows,

00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:10.610
as though insects
never evolved flight.

00:35:10.610 --> 00:35:16.230
So our ideas of perfect or
ideal or advanced or primitive

00:35:16.230 --> 00:35:19.260
are completely
irrelevant to nature.

00:35:19.260 --> 00:35:20.870
And that has a lot
of implications

00:35:20.870 --> 00:35:22.880
for how we think about ecology.

00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:28.280
And I haven't even talked
about the co-evolution

00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:31.590
of parasites and pathogens.

00:35:31.590 --> 00:35:36.700
I mean, when you get these
micro-- really intense

00:35:36.700 --> 00:35:38.440
microscopic views
of spiders, you

00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:43.522
see that spiders have mites, and
some of those mites have mites.

00:35:43.522 --> 00:35:46.450
So spiders have made
very clear to me

00:35:46.450 --> 00:35:48.250
that evolution is aimless.

00:35:48.250 --> 00:35:49.330
There's no goal.

00:35:49.330 --> 00:35:52.300
If there were a goal, we
would have one or two species

00:35:52.300 --> 00:35:55.210
of spiders and not
more than 40,000.

00:35:55.210 --> 00:35:58.810
And it's not all
aiming at the orb web.

00:35:58.810 --> 00:36:02.472
So I just wanted to say I
hope that you've enjoyed this.

00:36:02.472 --> 00:36:04.720
These concepts, these
evolutionary concepts,

00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:08.110
actually, once you get
them, are quite simple.

00:36:08.110 --> 00:36:10.859
And once you start paying
attention to spider silk,

00:36:10.859 --> 00:36:12.900
and even though this is
an incredibly clean room,

00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:15.230
I'm sure we could
find some here.

00:36:15.230 --> 00:36:17.650
Once you start paying
attention to spider silk,

00:36:17.650 --> 00:36:19.540
you start noticing
all sorts of things

00:36:19.540 --> 00:36:22.520
that you would never
notice otherwise.

00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:28.900
So if you're interested
in a little more about how

00:36:28.900 --> 00:36:30.460
the book came about
or some things

00:36:30.460 --> 00:36:32.840
that we didn't manage
to get into the book,

00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:34.840
you can check out my website.

00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:36.960
And this organization,
cpali.org,

00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:40.680
is my co-author, Kay
Craig, has started

00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:45.600
an organization in Madagascar
based on her knowledge of silk.

00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:48.680
That's a conservation
and poverty alleviation

00:36:48.680 --> 00:36:51.050
program in Madagascar.

00:36:51.050 --> 00:36:52.810
So thank you very much.

00:36:52.810 --> 00:36:55.500
And if you have any questions,
I'm happy to answer them.

00:37:00.545 --> 00:37:02.170
MALE SPEAKER: Thanks
very much, Leslie.

00:37:02.170 --> 00:37:02.540
LESLIE BRUNETTA: Thank you.

00:37:02.540 --> 00:37:03.915
MALE SPEAKER: That
was fantastic.

00:37:03.915 --> 00:37:05.160
Fascinating.

00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:06.820
I know we started
late, but some people

00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:08.028
will have 2 o'clock meetings.

00:37:08.028 --> 00:37:11.607
So let's have questions
for the next eight minutes,

00:37:11.607 --> 00:37:13.440
then let people leave
without embarrassment.

00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:15.023
Of course, these are
Googlers, so they

00:37:15.023 --> 00:37:16.987
won't be embarrassed anyway.

00:37:16.987 --> 00:37:19.320
And then anyone who wants to
stay after that, I'm sure--

00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:20.360
LESLIE BRUNETTA: Yeah.

00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:21.260
MALE SPEAKER: --if
you're available.

00:37:21.260 --> 00:37:21.720
LESLIE BRUNETTA: I'm available.

00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:22.553
MALE SPEAKER: Great.

00:37:22.553 --> 00:37:23.790
LESLIE BRUNETTA: Yes?

00:37:23.790 --> 00:37:25.040
AUDIENCE: As a result
of writing this book,

00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:27.520
have you developed any more
intimate fondness for spiders?

00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:30.370
Do you keep any
spiders as pets now?

00:37:30.370 --> 00:37:35.250
LESLIE BRUNETTA: I don't keep
them, but they like my house.

00:37:35.250 --> 00:37:38.350
We don't do a lot of housework.

00:37:38.350 --> 00:37:38.850
Yes?

00:37:38.850 --> 00:37:41.300
AUDIENCE: So why do insects
still fly into the web?

00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:43.100
LESLIE BRUNETTA: Oh, so-- Right.

00:37:43.100 --> 00:37:47.950
So there-- maybe this isn't
the right metaphor to use.

00:37:47.950 --> 00:37:50.470
But there is this arms race
between the development

00:37:50.470 --> 00:37:55.610
of insect vision systems,
which are pretty amazing,

00:37:55.610 --> 00:37:58.390
and the optical qualities
of the-- let's see

00:37:58.390 --> 00:38:03.270
if I can also find
you a couple of-- OK.

00:38:03.270 --> 00:38:11.120
So for instance,
here's an orb web.

00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:17.540
The reflectance patterns
in the web, insects

00:38:17.540 --> 00:38:18.710
can actually learn.

00:38:18.710 --> 00:38:23.840
There have been-- my co-author
started some of this.

00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:27.260
There have been experiments that
show that flying insects can

00:38:27.260 --> 00:38:30.020
learn not to fly into webs.

00:38:30.020 --> 00:38:32.290
If they fly into one,
get stuck, and escape--

00:38:32.290 --> 00:38:34.630
which happens a lot--
they will-- most of them

00:38:34.630 --> 00:38:37.130
will not fly back
into the same web.

00:38:37.130 --> 00:38:39.890
There are some, she said, that
was almost sort of tragically

00:38:39.890 --> 00:38:42.690
comical, would keep
flying back in.

00:38:42.690 --> 00:38:45.770
But they will learn.

00:38:45.770 --> 00:38:48.506
But what happens is you can
see, even to the human eye,

00:38:48.506 --> 00:38:50.005
and obviously they
see differently--

00:38:50.005 --> 00:38:53.800
a bit differently than
we do, as that shifts,

00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:55.360
they're never static.

00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:57.130
Because the plants
that they're on

00:38:57.130 --> 00:38:59.040
are constantly
slightly shifting.

00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:02.010
And so you get these--
the pattern breaks up.

00:39:02.010 --> 00:39:04.910
And the insects work mainly
by pattern recognition.

00:39:04.910 --> 00:39:11.765
You also get-- this is the
web of a golden orb weaver.

00:39:11.765 --> 00:39:13.140
This happens to
be in Madagascar.

00:39:13.140 --> 00:39:16.230
But we have these in the
southern states also.

00:39:16.230 --> 00:39:18.450
You see how sort of
yellow and golden it is.

00:39:18.450 --> 00:39:20.009
AUDIENCE: About how big is that?

00:39:20.009 --> 00:39:21.550
LESLIE BRUNETTA:
That was really big.

00:39:21.550 --> 00:39:22.320
That was really big.

00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:24.180
AUDIENCE: So the spider
itself was a pretty good size?

00:39:24.180 --> 00:39:26.680
LESLIE BRUNETTA: About-- not
as big as you would think.

00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:27.390
About that big.

00:39:30.050 --> 00:39:31.040
So that's golden.

00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:36.364
Well, a lot of these insects
are looking for yellow flowers.

00:39:36.364 --> 00:39:37.280
AUDIENCE: It's a trap.

00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:39.410
LESLIE BRUNETTA: Yeah.

00:39:39.410 --> 00:39:42.810
And then here's
another example where

00:39:42.810 --> 00:39:44.930
there are a lot of insects.

00:39:44.930 --> 00:39:47.210
So you know Charlotte
in "Charlotte's Web"

00:39:47.210 --> 00:39:49.970
wrote in her web?

00:39:49.970 --> 00:39:52.350
He, White, got that
idea because there

00:39:52.350 --> 00:39:54.940
are lots of spiders that put
decorations in their webs.

00:39:54.940 --> 00:39:56.710
And it's still kind
of controversial

00:39:56.710 --> 00:39:59.990
exactly what those
decorations are about,

00:39:59.990 --> 00:40:07.620
whether they're predator
deterrence or prey attraction.

00:40:07.620 --> 00:40:11.690
But that's cribellate--
it's aciniform silk

00:40:11.690 --> 00:40:14.600
and sometimes cribellate silk
that they're putting on there.

00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:16.830
There's different
UV reflectance.

00:40:16.830 --> 00:40:20.790
And most insects
are attracted to UV,

00:40:20.790 --> 00:40:24.710
because there are UV
stripes often on plants

00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:27.630
leading to the
flower and also UV

00:40:27.630 --> 00:40:30.540
will often signal
to them open space.

00:40:30.540 --> 00:40:35.470
So in this particular
photograph,

00:40:35.470 --> 00:40:39.420
what she was trying to show
is that if you look on the--

00:40:39.420 --> 00:40:43.710
if you look down here,
this is a grass stock.

00:40:43.710 --> 00:40:45.800
And this is a UV photo.

00:40:45.800 --> 00:40:48.190
And the reflectance
of these decorations

00:40:48.190 --> 00:40:50.320
is quite similar
to the grass stock.

00:40:53.300 --> 00:40:57.560
So that's what's going
on, back and forth

00:40:57.560 --> 00:41:01.350
between the spiders
and the flying insects.

00:41:01.350 --> 00:41:01.850
Yes?

00:41:01.850 --> 00:41:04.183
AUDIENCE: I'm sort of surprised
that people would expect

00:41:04.183 --> 00:41:08.030
an answer to, is this predator
avoidance or prey attractance?

00:41:08.030 --> 00:41:12.602
Like it's something to help
the spider live longer.

00:41:12.602 --> 00:41:13.560
LESLIE BRUNETTA: Right.

00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:14.976
But it'll be both
of those things.

00:41:14.976 --> 00:41:17.187
But the interesting
question is--

00:41:17.187 --> 00:41:19.020
so there are a couple
interesting questions.

00:41:19.020 --> 00:41:22.070
One is it's a balance,
because their prey are

00:41:22.070 --> 00:41:25.660
arthropods with
arthropod vision systems,

00:41:25.660 --> 00:41:27.380
and their predators
are arthropods

00:41:27.380 --> 00:41:29.430
with arthropod vision systems.

00:41:29.430 --> 00:41:33.590
So there's this balance
between attracting prey and not

00:41:33.590 --> 00:41:35.780
attracting predators.

00:41:35.780 --> 00:41:38.040
I mean, there's a long way
to go before we figure out

00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:39.250
what's going on with this.

00:41:39.250 --> 00:41:41.820
And also, my suspicion,
just because there's

00:41:41.820 --> 00:41:46.540
such a huge-- thousands and
thousands of these species--

00:41:46.540 --> 00:41:48.690
it's probably different
in different cases,

00:41:48.690 --> 00:41:50.190
depending on where
they are and what

00:41:50.190 --> 00:41:53.760
the particular environment is.

00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:56.210
Yeah?

00:41:56.210 --> 00:41:59.640
AUDIENCE: For some
animals [INAUDIBLE]

00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:03.315
the other motivating factor
for changes in what they do

00:42:03.315 --> 00:42:04.540
is reproduction.

00:42:04.540 --> 00:42:08.950
Do spiders also do special
stuff with their--?

00:42:08.950 --> 00:42:12.370
LESLIE BRUNETTA:
Ah, spider sex is--

00:42:12.370 --> 00:42:15.910
so there are a couple of
things about spider sex.

00:42:15.910 --> 00:42:19.020
First of all, nobody
has quite figured out

00:42:19.020 --> 00:42:23.010
why they've evolved-- the males,
at the front of the spider's

00:42:23.010 --> 00:42:24.540
body there are pedipalps.

00:42:24.540 --> 00:42:27.100
And the males have
these modified feet

00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:30.040
called palpal organs.

00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:35.510
So what they do before they
mate, the male spiders go out.

00:42:35.510 --> 00:42:38.860
They go upside down, let's
say, between a couple

00:42:38.860 --> 00:42:40.070
of rocks or something.

00:42:40.070 --> 00:42:42.790
They spin a little web,
called a sperm web.

00:42:42.790 --> 00:42:45.600
Then they deposit
the sperm on the web.

00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:48.510
Then they suck the sperm
or draw the sperm up

00:42:48.510 --> 00:42:50.390
into these palpal organs.

00:42:50.390 --> 00:42:52.620
And then they go
looking for a female.

00:42:52.620 --> 00:42:54.770
And so these palpal
organs are what

00:42:54.770 --> 00:42:58.950
they insert into
the female spiders.

00:42:58.950 --> 00:43:03.660
So now there's also a
problem, because they're also

00:43:03.660 --> 00:43:06.030
very sexually
dimorphic, spiders.

00:43:06.030 --> 00:43:09.110
Which means that there's
a big difference in size.

00:43:09.110 --> 00:43:12.690
The females tend to be giant,
and the males tend to be tiny.

00:43:12.690 --> 00:43:17.480
And they tend-- this whole
idea that the females always

00:43:17.480 --> 00:43:19.410
eat the male is not true.

00:43:19.410 --> 00:43:22.430
Again, because there's
so many species,

00:43:22.430 --> 00:43:24.840
there's a huge variety
of things that happen.

00:43:24.840 --> 00:43:28.250
And so these mating practices
between different spiders

00:43:28.250 --> 00:43:30.160
are, like, all over the place.

00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:32.160
There's a certain
amount of cannibalism.

00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:35.740
There's a certain amount of-- I
forget the right term for this,

00:43:35.740 --> 00:43:38.490
but basically, the
palps go into the female

00:43:38.490 --> 00:43:41.390
and then break off, which
then prevents other males

00:43:41.390 --> 00:43:44.670
from inserting their palps.

00:43:44.670 --> 00:43:50.490
There are males who the
female will be on her web,

00:43:50.490 --> 00:43:54.610
and the male will figure out a
different pattern of vibrations

00:43:54.610 --> 00:43:57.110
to put on the web so that
she recognizes him as a male

00:43:57.110 --> 00:43:58.820
and not as prey.

00:43:58.820 --> 00:44:02.280
So there's-- that's a
whole other lecture.

00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:04.820
And actually, I don't--
I'm not an expert in that.

00:44:04.820 --> 00:44:07.168
But there are people who are.

00:44:07.168 --> 00:44:07.876
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:44:07.876 --> 00:44:10.100
Let's-- it's almost 2 o'clock.

00:44:10.100 --> 00:44:13.020
Let's thank Leslie
again for coming.
