00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.400
After you have a good idea of what the system looks like, from the outside, and

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:07.990
how it is expected to behave, you can begin the architectural design process.

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:11.380
This involves decomposing the system in to it's components, and allocating

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:15.300
responsibilities to them. Now we did this before, when we did this exercise, but

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:19.850
that was an analysis model. Here, when we're talking about act, act,

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:24.200
architectural design we're actually going into the solution phase of things.

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.750
Now, one of the features of object oriented development is that it's often

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:34.030
the case that the particular elements that we come out of the analysis with,

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.250
our pieces there, translate into pieces into the architecture and

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.050
ultimately into the implementation. In addition to decomposing the system into

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.190
it's components, we have to allocate responsibilities to the components, for

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:51.152
handling those direct and indirect effects of the events, okay? And

00:00:51.152 --> 00:00:55.102
we're going to express that using OCL invariants and pre and

00:00:55.102 --> 00:01:01.570
post conditions. To indicate how those responsibilities are being satisfied
