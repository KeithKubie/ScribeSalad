1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,193
Oh wait, you're listening.

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:03,903
[inaudible]

3
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:09,060
okay. We're listening to
radio lab radio way too.

4
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:17,223
[inaudible]

5
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:21,820
[inaudible]

6
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:24,590
awesome. New York public
radio. Public radio. W

7
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:30,303
[inaudible] radio.

8
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:35,970
Sure.

9
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:41,250
Okay. Okay. So the um, the other day,

10
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:45,900
I bet. Should we say we are? Yes, we
should. Okay. Jad Robert Radiolab.

11
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,710
Okay. So the other day Soren called
us into the studio. They are,

12
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:51,280
oh.

13
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:00,750
And there was a giant human sized
Roden sitting in the engineering seat.

14
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:01,521
Very large road.

15
00:01:01,521 --> 00:01:05,310
And it was very familiar to us because
it was a puppet head that we had toured

16
00:01:05,311 --> 00:01:08,520
with. Who is that under that big
street and well that's the question.

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,650
That is the question maybe you guys
should guess or something. Oh my goodness.

18
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:17,640
Is it, um, is this Helen? Oh my God.

19
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:23,240
Oh my God. [inaudible]

20
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:27,010
[inaudible]

21
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:27,231
all right.

22
00:01:27,231 --> 00:01:31,130
So the story is the reason that snoring
got Ellen to surprise us is that

23
00:01:31,131 --> 00:01:35,570
somewhere around now is the
15 year crazy to say it.

24
00:01:35,571 --> 00:01:39,620
15 year anniversary of making radio
lab. 15 years. I know we were,

25
00:01:39,621 --> 00:01:42,680
have some tape for you guys. Oh,
there's more, right? We brought,

26
00:01:42,681 --> 00:01:45,170
you said it's just your presence.
Yeah, I mean the presence,

27
00:01:45,171 --> 00:01:48,650
I mean it seemed like you gotta have
someone around who knew you when you know,

28
00:01:48,651 --> 00:01:51,680
okay, perfect audience with my
presence. So we sort of settled in.

29
00:01:51,681 --> 00:01:55,160
We didn't really know what was going on
and then horn did something truly evil.

30
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,450
She somehow,

31
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:01,480
I don't know how probably the archivist
help got her hands on the very first

32
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:07,460
one. This is my nightmare. The very,

33
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:10,070
very, very, I had hoped these
tapes and that would never surface,

34
00:02:10,071 --> 00:02:10,904
but she found them.

35
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:15,020
They were on bit torrent for a second
and I thought they had disappeared and I

36
00:02:15,021 --> 00:02:19,910
was like so happy. But then
[inaudible] already yet it's okay.

37
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:21,890
Let me rotate. All right, here we go.

38
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:30,350
2002 very first one. Okay. Don't start
talking. Please make the CD crash.

39
00:02:30,351 --> 00:02:31,184
Right now.

40
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:36,020
Every radio producer has this
idealized image in their head of you.

41
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:40,160
Oh God. Maybe you're sitting
on the couch drinking coffee,

42
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:41,930
staring out the window.

43
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:47,650
Maybe you're the person who's driving and
you pull over to really concentrate on

44
00:02:47,871 --> 00:02:50,150
a story. Whenever the case,

45
00:02:50,151 --> 00:02:54,620
that image in the radio producers
brain of you, the listener,

46
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:59,240
that's why they make this
stuff still only thing. Yeah,

47
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:00,250
they don't get paid much.

48
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:05,320
And you look around these heavy recorders
and mikes and they look frankly silly

49
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:07,300
in those headphones. I have to wear it,

50
00:03:07,301 --> 00:03:11,710
but it doesn't matter as long as you
are there to listen to what they make.

51
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:16,570
W N Y C is about to
embark on an experiment.

52
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:19,800
We're calling it the
radio lab and love that.

53
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:25,240
We're going to do great documentary
radio and stories of different sizes and

54
00:03:25,271 --> 00:03:26,080
shapes,

55
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,460
colors from different places all over
the planet from different times even.

56
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:33,370
And we're going to mix it
all together like this.

57
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,670
Whoa. Wait,

58
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,960
the big brew of people and places,

59
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:44,980
but it'll take two hours and
59 minutes to get through.

60
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:48,970
Oh, two hours, 15 minutes,
two hours, three hours.

61
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:52,140
It was a three hour show and was I
that was that every week, by the way.

62
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:55,890
Every freaking week. Every week.
Eight to 11 every Sunday night.

63
00:03:55,891 --> 00:03:59,130
So they were giving you
a huge hunk of airtime,

64
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:01,410
a huge hunk of airtime
where no one was listening.

65
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,050
Javelin rod here I'll be your,

66
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:08,830
hmm, host is not the right
word. Curator guide maybe.

67
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:11,320
How about DJ of documentary?

68
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:16,070
Oh shut up. That was really terrible.

69
00:04:16,071 --> 00:04:17,210
That doesn't work at all.

70
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,940
Every moment of that was robbed.

71
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:28,120
Every moment I have to explain like this
show is just super different back then.

72
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:31,700
The idea of it back then was to just take
all of these documentaries from around

73
00:04:31,701 --> 00:04:33,440
the world and smashed them together.

74
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:36,800
But what would end up happening is
that like I would line up three or four

75
00:04:36,801 --> 00:04:39,620
things and I would have
like a 20 minute hole,

76
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:41,590
which I would start to experiment in.

77
00:04:41,591 --> 00:04:45,030
And that's those spots were what
the show grew out of. Well, so,

78
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:50,240
so that was in 2002 and then I met you
the following spring and then a year

79
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:53,750
later, a whole year later. And
so there's a year worth of that.

80
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:58,190
And by the time I met
you back in New York,

81
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:02,150
you were so sleep deprived. Okay.

82
00:05:02,151 --> 00:05:03,770
So we reminisced for a little bit.

83
00:05:03,771 --> 00:05:06,740
And then we started talking about
the moment when Robert got involved,

84
00:05:06,741 --> 00:05:10,130
which is a moment I'll never
forget. So, um, you know,

85
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:11,900
I was trying to fill one
of those 20 minute holes.

86
00:05:11,901 --> 00:05:16,901
I had done an interview with a memory
researcher and it was just one of those

87
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:18,351
signs,

88
00:05:18,351 --> 00:05:21,500
interviews that now we're super familiar
with where like the scientist is using

89
00:05:21,501 --> 00:05:24,560
all this latinate words and I couldn't
figure out what she was saying,

90
00:05:24,561 --> 00:05:27,680
but it still seemed interesting.
I just couldn't understand it.

91
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:31,540
And so a Robert and Ellen and I had
breakfast one day at Kitchenette,

92
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:35,390
our foundation restaurant, that's where
you go to for breakfast every week.

93
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:38,810
And we were sitting there and I
was like, I got this interview.

94
00:05:38,811 --> 00:05:39,621
I don't really know what to do.

95
00:05:39,621 --> 00:05:42,230
It's about memory and here's
what I think she's saying.

96
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:44,690
I think she's saying something about
how memories are never the same.

97
00:05:44,691 --> 00:05:46,190
You're always constantly remaking them.

98
00:05:46,191 --> 00:05:50,180
And then you just like snapped into
this thing where like suddenly you were

99
00:05:50,181 --> 00:05:55,040
playing this like all these
characters and w l and I were like,

100
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:58,070
oh my God, let's just go into the studio
and have do that and you want to hear

101
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:01,190
a little taste of that time. I'm
sort of curious what we, this was,

102
00:06:01,191 --> 00:06:01,960
this was one.

103
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,970
So the one like we later did the
memory and forgetting as a podcast,

104
00:06:04,971 --> 00:06:09,650
but this is pre, this is before.
That is a diff earlier 2003 I think.

105
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,073
[inaudible]

106
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:24,830
you're listening to radio
lab on New York public radio,

107
00:06:24,831 --> 00:06:29,630
public radio w and the

108
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:35,720
Jab. I'm Ron. This is radio lab. We're
coming up on the Kitty Hawk centennial,

109
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:39,170
the hundredth anniversary of
the first human powered flight.

110
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:42,830
It's in a couple of weeks and I was
looking at the picture today. No,

111
00:06:42,831 --> 00:06:45,650
you weren't the Wright brothers. You
know the one Oroville is on the plane.

112
00:06:45,651 --> 00:06:49,340
It's just taking off. Wilbur is
running alongside there on a beach.

113
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,260
The beach is deserted. It looks really,

114
00:06:51,261 --> 00:06:53,840
really cold and I'm looking at this photo.

115
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:58,700
Really noticed the most published
picture in the history of pictures.

116
00:06:59,150 --> 00:06:59,900
What are the collateral?

117
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:03,770
Even though I have anyone who's ever
been born as seen it 100,000 times,

118
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:07,250
I couldn't help but be wowed.
I mean, look what they did.

119
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:12,670
They got their crazy box into the air a
couple hundred feet or whatever it was.

120
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,600
Wasn't that great a
distance, but look at us now.

121
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:23,420
We can fly over the Atlantic in
five hours, a few hundred dollars

122
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:28,700
and that is not what we're going to talk
about today because my real question is

123
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:33,860
how is it we can do all that and still
not understand some very basic things

124
00:07:33,861 --> 00:07:37,550
like common cold. That's the
example that's always given.

125
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:38,903
What about memory?

126
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:44,190
What about memory? Is that what she
used? [inaudible] that's a good intro.

127
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:49,290
Every, how's a minute? 30 wow.

128
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,530
That's sort of like, well
here's the pogo stick.

129
00:07:52,531 --> 00:07:56,010
I'm going to jump on it 50
times. But what about tissues?

130
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,180
It's such a good idea to wait to get in.

131
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:05,300
We eventually talk about Kitty Hawk
or was that just, oh no, but let's,

132
00:08:05,301 --> 00:08:08,460
let's go a little bit further forward so
we get to hear Robert enter the room 18

133
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:10,490
Volvo's creativity.

134
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:14,750
This club actually begins with a reading
from theater director and actor Simon

135
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:17,510
McBurney. You have to
literally remake it every time.

136
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:22,600
Every memory that you
remember is different because
it is we made in the very

137
00:08:23,481 --> 00:08:27,830
present that you remember another
words in order to remember,

138
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:30,290
you need the imagination.

139
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:34,223
[inaudible]

140
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:37,630
Simon McBurney performing a monologue
from is playing pneumonic for the show

141
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:38,760
studio three 60.

142
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:42,270
And with me in the studio to explore
these ideas a little further.

143
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:46,390
Is Mr Robert Krulwich from
ABC News or Robert Height,

144
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:48,790
you've reported on this,
right? Yeah, they have,

145
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:52,040
I'd never actually met
Simon McBurney, but uh,

146
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:55,740
that thought that he has at the
very end that in order to something

147
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:59,820
you need an active imagination. I think
it's kind of understating it really,

148
00:08:59,821 --> 00:09:02,070
I think. And just stating
your house. How's that? Well,

149
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:04,980
let's just take the situation
we're in right now. Okay.

150
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:07,380
I'm sitting here in front
of you. We're about what,

151
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,360
three feet apart or something like that.

152
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:12,780
So when you look at me right now,

153
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:16,830
it takes actually the light
that's bouncing off my face,

154
00:09:16,831 --> 00:09:20,220
a tiny bit of time to reach
your retina. But by the way,

155
00:09:20,221 --> 00:09:22,770
I arrive upside down and
have your brain write me,

156
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,820
takes a little bit of
time for the sound of me.

157
00:09:26,821 --> 00:09:29,070
This sound right now you think ha,

158
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:33,060
but the sound is to travel at
750 miles an hour for me to you.

159
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:35,910
Okay the rest to enter
that ear that you have,

160
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,940
it has to travel through those
hairs that you've got in your ear.

161
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:40,770
It has to turn into electricity.

162
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:45,810
It has to go to the place in your brain
where sounds lie and then the touch of

163
00:09:46,351 --> 00:09:46,471
me,

164
00:09:46,471 --> 00:09:49,260
if I were to touch you right now and have
to travel electrically to your brain,

165
00:09:49,261 --> 00:09:51,840
that would take a little
time. God had the smell of,

166
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:53,520
suppose I put some licorice in my mouth.

167
00:09:53,521 --> 00:09:57,480
I gone the smell of the
licorice coming out of my mouth.

168
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:01,470
That too would have to travel all
the way to your nose, up your nose,

169
00:10:01,471 --> 00:10:02,790
into the place where smells lie,

170
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,800
and then your brain has to take all
these parts and pull them together into

171
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:12,120
this, this thing that you
think is going on right now.

172
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:16,450
Wait, let me get this straight. You're
saying that that this moment, yes,

173
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:20,680
and this one and this one,
yes, are hopelessly lost.

174
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,190
So when people say that you know you have
to live in the moment, to this moment,

175
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:28,900
the moment, the moment already just
happened. Or to put it another way,

176
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:33,400
it's a memory. Everything.
Everything is a memory.

177
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:38,710
Wow. So let's say we want
to ponder this moment.

178
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:44,130
This one you say has already happened
before it even had a chance to become this

179
00:10:44,591 --> 00:10:47,470
moment. But let's say we want to
remember it later. What do we do?

180
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:48,850
It's interesting at this,

181
00:10:48,851 --> 00:10:52,960
what's going to happen is you're
going to take the touch to the sound,

182
00:10:52,961 --> 00:10:55,000
the smell, and everything that's
in your brain from that moment,

183
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:59,110
which is all sitting lodged in different
places and you're going to reassemble

184
00:10:59,111 --> 00:11:01,510
it, pull it back together again.
Now, here's the interesting thing.

185
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:05,260
If 20 minutes from now
you are really hungry,

186
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:09,010
then the licorice member, the
licorice part of our discussion. Yup.

187
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:13,750
The licorice part will somehow loom a
little larger because you want to eat or

188
00:11:13,751 --> 00:11:14,590
chew something.

189
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:19,720
How you're feeling in the moment that
you're remembering has a lot to do with

190
00:11:19,721 --> 00:11:21,190
what you remember. So for that,

191
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:26,220
let's just take a simple a phrase like
Jack and Jill went up the hill to fetch a

192
00:11:26,531 --> 00:11:31,180
pail of water, right? If you
want to recollect that phrase,

193
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:34,600
let's suppose you just had
a wonderful thing with Jill.

194
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:39,150
Now when you think of the rhyme,
when you reassemble it, Jack,

195
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,730
it'll go jack.

196
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:46,780
And he went up the hill
to fetch a pail of water.

197
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:49,840
Wait, see the, see the Jill thing is.

198
00:11:49,841 --> 00:11:54,841
So I that instead you've just come from
an extraordinary hike where you have

199
00:11:56,650 --> 00:12:00,340
gloriously climate spectacular
hill. So now you hear the thing.

200
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:05,490
And when you re assembled this time
yet you think Jack and Jill went up the

201
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:07,493
hill.

202
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:09,630
[inaudible]

203
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:13,720
I see the sudden now the hill nus
has got all the emphasis. I got it.

204
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:17,150
So you're always remembering
differently. Each time up,

205
00:12:17,151 --> 00:12:20,090
depending upon how you feel. This
reminds me of sunny. We here,

206
00:12:20,091 --> 00:12:21,530
let me play you this interview clip

207
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:24,100
every time you recall
something. You're doing so good.

208
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:27,740
I mean, it's amazing to me
that at such an early point,

209
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:32,960
the business of deconstructing puzzles,
which I guess is a lot of what we did,

210
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:37,100
uh, took on this very particular quality,

211
00:12:37,101 --> 00:12:41,480
like this kind of razzle-dazzle of
anything could happen in the next second.

212
00:12:41,481 --> 00:12:43,130
I don't know who's gonna
say the next thing,

213
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:48,260
but there's something beautifully organic
about it when it's done. Yeah. So,

214
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,353
uh, today we're selling [inaudible]

lab coming up after the break.

216
00:12:55,111 --> 00:12:57,630
We're going to play the first
thing we ever podcasted.

217
00:12:58,050 --> 00:13:00,960
It's not something you can get on iTunes
cause it fell off iTunes a long time

218
00:13:00,961 --> 00:13:04,230
ago. But we're going to play
you the first [inaudible].

Hey, we're back. Uh, so the
first episode we ever podcasted,

242
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:26,510
I don't know if it was
literally the first,

243
00:14:26,511 --> 00:14:30,500
but it was among the first
few was an episode about time.

244
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:35,250
I do remember playing it to my wife who
I was always scared cause she was in new

245
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:37,370
your times reporter and I thought, oh
she'll never liked this kind of thing.

246
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:41,900
And she came out of the kitchen
and she said, I really like that.

247
00:14:41,901 --> 00:14:46,730
And immediately I called through you call
me and you were like, oh you whisper.

248
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:51,890
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's one of the, one
of the early modes where like maybe this

249
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:53,420
will work. Yeah. Again,

250
00:14:53,421 --> 00:14:56,060
this is something that fell off
our podcast for ed years ago,

251
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:58,520
so probably very few
people have heard this.

252
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:06,410
You are listening to radio on New
York public radio, public radio,W

253
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:09,950
Y s

254
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:14,893
[inaudible] [inaudible]

255
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:21,580
[inaudible]

256
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:25,610
do you know this music? Trust me.

257
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,620
You've heard it your entire life.

258
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:32,690
[inaudible]

259
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:37,460
the reason you can't recognize it now
is because the composer born in 1770

260
00:15:37,461 --> 00:15:41,360
intended for this moment that when
you're hearing to last two seconds

261
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:46,863
[inaudible]

262
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:49,700
caliber. Had he been a whale,

263
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:52,460
Beethoven might've written
his ninth symphony this way.

264
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:02,070
Changes that for us.
We're taking an instant,

265
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:07,710
we transpire over minutes and a
movement might last six hours.

266
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:10,350
That's in fact what this is.

267
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:14,670
Beethoven's Ninth Symphony digitally
stretched from its normal 60 some odd

268
00:16:14,671 --> 00:16:18,600
minutes to last an entire day, 24 hours

269
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:25,360
and if you sit for the entire 24 hour
duration of the piece as people do from

270
00:16:25,361 --> 00:16:30,010
time to time you realize that
this music is not simply slower.

271
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:34,500
The Sloane is unlocks
something in the original.

272
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:41,340
Maybe it was there all along and we
couldn't hear it. Play with the meter.

273
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:45,270
Music is mostly about meter after all
and the music has a different story to

274
00:16:45,271 --> 00:16:49,530
tell a secret perhaps locked
up and signed through routine,

275
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,500
changed the routine and
make new discoveries.

276
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:58,680
That's what we'll do this hour.
We'll look at time so closely.

277
00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:00,150
We'll discover new things about it.

278
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:03,820
[inaudible]

279
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:05,670
this is Radiolab. I'm Jad up and Ron,

280
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:09,490
my guest tonight for the next hour to
help me wrestle with time is the science

281
00:17:09,491 --> 00:17:13,450
correspondent, Robert Crow, which
of ABC News and Nova and Nightline.

282
00:17:13,451 --> 00:17:15,010
How are you sir? I'm very well.

283
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:18,340
I like this bathing in Beethoven thing
you've got going on. It's cool, right?

284
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:20,170
Yeah. Actually at the end of the program,

285
00:17:20,171 --> 00:17:23,350
we will be dropping in on a performance
that happened recently in San Francisco

286
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:28,060
where people listen to it over the
course of an entire day or day a day.

287
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:33,220
So where first, let's begin with a
guy who I think you'll find, well,

288
00:17:33,221 --> 00:17:37,660
he thinks very deeply about time. In
fact, in a very general kind of way,

289
00:17:37,661 --> 00:17:40,720
you could say he's time obsessed.
You've heard of the neurologist,

290
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:44,510
Oliver's hacks. Sure. The man who
mistook his wife for a hat. Yeah. Right.

291
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:47,650
And a weakness. So I
was over at his house.

292
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,710
This is me actually over
at his house right now.

293
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:53,340
Keep turning. Um, and
he told me this story.

294
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:57,260
I don't know whether this is relevant.
I had an odd experience some years ago.

295
00:17:57,261 --> 00:18:00,370
In fact, in 1993 when I got a, um,

296
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,140
a message from my publisher,

297
00:18:03,141 --> 00:18:06,210
which they had sent out to
various of their authors, uh,

298
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:08,030
for their 21st birthday,

299
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:13,210
the jubilee asking if we would like to
select a year from the previous 21 years

300
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:18,170
and write about it. Um, when I
got this message, I thought, well,

301
00:18:18,171 --> 00:18:22,850
why don't I choose 1972, which was the
first of the years and it's a year,

302
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:25,180
which is, uh, um,

303
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:28,160
very vivid and important for me,

304
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:31,460
partly because it was the
year in which my mother died.

305
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:36,320
Partly it was the a in which I completed
awakenings. And these two events,

306
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:39,470
uh, were coupled in some ways.

307
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:44,060
I was actually in the car
when I got this message.

308
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:48,710
I picked it up on a car phone and I was
driving up to Canada and I had a tape

309
00:18:48,711 --> 00:18:50,750
recorder with me. So I, um,

310
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:55,340
I spoke 1972 aloud and by that time,

311
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,380
uh, I thought, well, why stop, why
don't I do in 1973 as well? Um,

312
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,450
by the time that long in 72 take,

313
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:07,460
did you get to Montreal or we used to
[inaudible] 72 probably took about, about,

314
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:12,950
um, half an hour. Well, by the time
I got to the Canadian border, um,

315
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:16,600
I was up to 1987. Um, and um,

316
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:21,230
I did in fact make an extra loop so
that I could complete things. Um,

317
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:24,320
however it turned out that the,

318
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:28,460
the most recent years in the
late eighties and the nineties,

319
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:32,450
I did not apparently have
such detailed memories of,

320
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,700
and they seem subjectively shorter.

321
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:39,000
So time, I guess we all know
this is a very plastic thing.

322
00:19:39,001 --> 00:19:43,620
It's swollen enriched some of the time
and it's like flacid and other times.

323
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:47,010
But because Oliver is so inquisitive,
such an investigator at heart,

324
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,420
all his life,

325
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:53,190
he's looked inside things and
beginning when he was a 10, 11,

326
00:19:53,191 --> 00:19:55,590
12, he wanted to get inside time.

327
00:19:56,220 --> 00:20:00,320
I had, I had, um, lots
of boyish interests, uh,

328
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:04,380
and um, you know, these
pre-adolescent interests, you know,

329
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:07,140
they will took a beating when I
became an adolescent, but, uh,

330
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:10,440
but one of them was chemicals
and I had a chemistry laboratory.

331
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:15,410
One of them was photography and I had
dark room and cameras and one of them was

332
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:16,493
plants.

333
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:20,700
And in particular my mother was very
fond of firms and the garden was full of

334
00:20:20,701 --> 00:20:23,940
firms. I love the way in which the, um,

335
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:29,730
the curled up fiddleheads or
cruisers or firms would unfurl.

336
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:34,350
And it was almost as if time was sort
of rolled up inside of them as if time

337
00:20:34,351 --> 00:20:38,220
itself unfilled, but when
couldn't actually see this,

338
00:20:38,221 --> 00:20:43,050
they were pets take a a day or two
to do this and I wanted to see it.

339
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:46,210
It made me think of these Christmas
things. One, we're blowing book,

340
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:51,400
these are paper trumpets,
which would unfold. And so I,

341
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:51,820
uh,

342
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:56,820
set up my camera on a tripod and at
least in the daytime I couldn't take

343
00:20:56,921 --> 00:20:58,540
pictures at night. I didn't have a flash.

344
00:20:58,541 --> 00:21:03,541
Then I took a series of pictures every
hour or so of the fun and that showed

345
00:21:04,661 --> 00:21:08,770
these rapidly by putting them
together in a flip book and this way,

346
00:21:08,771 --> 00:21:13,771
then what took a day or two or several
hours to happen was compressed into

347
00:21:14,681 --> 00:21:15,670
several seconds.

348
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:20,350
So the compression of time
photographically fascinated me,

349
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:24,910
yes to if Oliver sacks can make
a baby from unfurl. Robert,

350
00:21:24,911 --> 00:21:26,380
how about this radio producer,

351
00:21:26,381 --> 00:21:29,890
Tony Schwartz can do the same
thing with his baby niece.

352
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:32,110
What exceptance sound, oh,

353
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35,950
here's sped up for your appreciation
is Nancy Schwartz from birthday

354
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:50,943
[inaudible]

355
00:23:59,370 --> 00:23:59,660
[inaudible]

356
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:01,460
you know what that is? What's that?

357
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:06,500
That is if you repair what you've just
heard is a parent clock up parent clock.

358
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:10,790
That's kind of cool
cause the kid gets older.

359
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:16,390
You can't deny the fact that you must
be getting older too when your son has

360
00:24:16,791 --> 00:24:21,020
hair on his legs. I thought, Oh man,

361
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:25,970
I'm getting old. But this is true.
This is how the whole world works.

362
00:24:25,971 --> 00:24:29,690
I think it's a, it's a, everything
is a clock I guess. Yeah. By the way,

363
00:24:29,691 --> 00:24:33,710
that was Nancy grows up in the audio
flip book recorded and arranged by the

364
00:24:33,711 --> 00:24:35,510
great radio producer Tony Schwartz.

365
00:24:35,511 --> 00:24:40,310
Thanks to him and to Smithsonian folkways
recordings and also to you Mr Rodmel

366
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:43,850
Cro, which for joining me today
on our program to talk about time.

367
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:44,893
So here's my question.

368
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:48,440
If we've got an example of what
you just called a parent clock,

369
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:52,310
you've got other kinds of time, you
know like PR, like personal time,

370
00:24:52,311 --> 00:24:55,970
getting out of bed, time going to
sleep. Most of the existence really

371
00:24:55,990 --> 00:25:00,670
time was measured by, oh it's lunchtime,
it's wake up time, right time to milk.

372
00:25:00,671 --> 00:25:04,480
The cow time events are
task time, tasks, times.

373
00:25:04,481 --> 00:25:09,320
How do we get from task and
personal time to clock time. Oh,

374
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:10,173
that's interesting.

375
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:14,440
Let's go back to the 18
hundreds and imagine a guy,

376
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:19,390
we'll call him all zoll Tom True Bogan
zeal to a hundred lawyers living in

377
00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:21,700
Sandusky, Ohio. And suppose
the old time wants to know,

378
00:25:21,701 --> 00:25:26,190
you know what time it is.
Okay, so if Zoltan walked into,

379
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:29,540
say bigsbys tavern and asked,
I missed the big speaker,

380
00:25:29,541 --> 00:25:32,600
I trouble you put the time, eight right
in front of you. You see these pocket,

381
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:34,810
it's built by my nephew,
not the smartest boy in the,

382
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:38,200
well it says 33 minutes past
the hour. Is that right?

383
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:42,020
Of course it's right. However,

384
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:45,680
if Zoltan instead of
going into the tavern,

385
00:25:45,681 --> 00:25:50,060
had he gone at the exact same
moment into the bank building,

386
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,290
how can I help you sir?

387
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:55,010
And I wondered if you could show me
the time to read minutes past the hour.

388
00:25:55,300 --> 00:26:00,020
Is he right though? Easy to right
or at that very same moment.

389
00:26:00,021 --> 00:26:02,990
Suppose instead of going to the tablet
of the bank, he'd gone to the hotel.

390
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:07,500
Can I hear you? Can you tell me
the time? Yes, of course. My,

391
00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:09,080
my time piece has pain,

392
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:14,280
which is actually initially the
style actually each 19 past the hour.

393
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:19,470
So at the tavern it's 33 past the
hour at the hotel, 19 past the bank,

394
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:23,760
three past. What time is it really
in Sandusky? That's the question.

395
00:26:23,761 --> 00:26:27,320
The answer is there was no
official time in Sandusky. Huh?

396
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:29,370
What do you mean there's
no official time and send?

397
00:26:29,371 --> 00:26:33,890
There wasn't any non 1850 government and
at the time really all there were were

398
00:26:33,891 --> 00:26:36,380
clocks. So in Ohio in the 1850s,

399
00:26:36,381 --> 00:26:39,200
you'd have as many times as
they were clocks in the town.

400
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:42,960
So there was no reason. And you
think about it to synchronize it,

401
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:45,920
your clock and my clock were four minutes
or 10 minutes different in Sandusky in

402
00:26:45,921 --> 00:26:48,240
1850s. Who cares until

403
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:54,670
the railroad changed every
one once the wheel road clean.

404
00:26:54,850 --> 00:26:59,180
If Zoltan wanted to take, uh, how about
the uh, three or three to Cleveland.

405
00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:01,460
Okay. If you wanted to take
the field, who you believe in,

406
00:27:01,461 --> 00:27:04,070
how would he know when it
was three Oh three. Oh,

407
00:27:04,071 --> 00:27:06,500
I see where you're going with this.
If you went by the bank's clock,

408
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:10,880
he'd arrived a half hour ahead of
time. If you went by the hotel clock,

409
00:27:10,881 --> 00:27:14,890
he'd arrived in the nicotine.
Oh wait, wait, wait.

410
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:16,460
And if you went by the taverns clock,

411
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:19,130
oh no. [inaudible]

412
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:22,870
so for the sake of their business,

413
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:26,980
read the railroads created railroad time
and began putting up clocks of their

414
00:27:26,981 --> 00:27:30,560
own. It makes sense. And because the
railroads were so important, right?

415
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:33,820
I mean the tavern would, you have to get
it's beer deliveries from the railroad.

416
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:36,520
And I guess the banks would have to get
their cash from the railroad and the

417
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:39,190
hotel would have to get their guests
when they're at road. So it gradually,

418
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:40,450
real time

419
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:42,390
becomes everybody's time.

420
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:43,563
Huh.

421
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:49,690
So what happened to local time? Will
local time disappeared. Really? Yeah.

422
00:27:49,691 --> 00:27:52,510
If local time means that
when it's noon in Sandusky,

423
00:27:52,511 --> 00:27:57,130
the sun is directly over your head.
By 1880 that wasn't true anymore.

424
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:57,790
Oh,

425
00:27:57,790 --> 00:28:02,790
the railroad had instructed Sandusky
that from now on it's noon would be 20

426
00:28:03,221 --> 00:28:05,830
minutes later. So that could
fit into the railroad schedule.

427
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:10,630
So they moved noon over 20 minutes
and they were protests about this.

428
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:15,750
I put it to you ladies and
gentleman. Oh, Noonan, shut up.

429
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:23,040
[inaudible]

430
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:25,260
so in all seriousness,
people fought against this.

431
00:28:25,261 --> 00:28:27,330
They rebelled against the railroads. Oh,

432
00:28:27,331 --> 00:28:30,930
there were time wars in certain towns
where part of the town would go to

433
00:28:30,931 --> 00:28:31,770
railroad time.

434
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:35,850
But the other part would determinately
stick with the what used to be local time

435
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:38,220
and they'd have different
times in the town. Wow.

436
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:42,210
It's almost like as a personal freedom
issue because time in a way represents

437
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,660
your own identity and they didn't
want to give up their identity to the

438
00:28:45,661 --> 00:28:48,150
railroad. Not at first,
but in the end, Sandusky.

439
00:28:48,151 --> 00:28:51,780
And then every other town eventually
conformed to railroad time.

440
00:28:51,781 --> 00:28:55,680
And that is how time became
standardized. Time became zoned.

441
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:59,190
Time became clock reference. And
you ask somebody, what time is it?

442
00:28:59,191 --> 00:29:01,580
They don't say, you know, oh
it's bedtime or it's lunchtime.

443
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:06,640
They don't look up at the side. They
look at a clock standard and the real,

444
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:12,840
that break pick of the other
time, one off every 60 minutes,

445
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:16,900
tweet every 12 hour tour of both
relentless hands, turning off Carload.

446
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:17,880
Lots of time.

447
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:28,110
There's an interesting
connection to explore here.
And it has to do with horses.

448
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:30,210
Horses, horses.

449
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:35,060
Okay. Alright. You mentioned
railroad companies.

450
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:37,680
It just so happens that the owner
of the biggest railroad company,

451
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:42,030
Leland Stanford, you know Stanford
University University, that right. He was

452
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:46,120
really into speed and he owned a
really fast horse and the horse,

453
00:29:46,121 --> 00:29:49,510
his name was oxidant oxidant. I
know, I remember that story goes.

454
00:29:49,511 --> 00:29:52,510
This horse was the subject
of a gentleman's bet. Well,

455
00:29:52,511 --> 00:29:55,510
there was no gentleman's bet. It's a myth.

456
00:29:55,570 --> 00:29:59,200
Danford so far as we know was not a
betting man. That's Rebecca Solnit.

457
00:29:59,201 --> 00:29:59,741
She would know.

458
00:29:59,741 --> 00:30:03,550
She wrote a book about this called river
of shadows and the focus of her book is

459
00:30:03,551 --> 00:30:06,970
the solver of the bed. Oh, look at
her. It was, it was an argument.

460
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,820
There's no evidence that there
was money on it. In any case,

461
00:30:09,821 --> 00:30:12,850
this argument amongst Stanford and
his railroad buddies sent it around.

462
00:30:12,851 --> 00:30:14,710
The following question.
When a horse gallops,

463
00:30:14,711 --> 00:30:18,580
do all four of its feet leave the ground
at once when you think? I don't know.

464
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:20,110
I'm just not a question.
I would frankly every,

465
00:30:20,111 --> 00:30:22,990
I was getting one but well at the time
it was a big question cause they had no

466
00:30:22,991 --> 00:30:25,660
way of knowing cause the horses
moved faster than eyeballs can see.

467
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:29,020
So Leland Stanford one and to prove
that of course at all four feet off the

468
00:30:29,021 --> 00:30:33,880
ground at one time and he was recommended
to try my bridge as the photographer

469
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:37,180
to capture this. Along comes
Edward Muybridge, the photographer,

470
00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:41,020
if he could take a picture of the horse
at exactly the right instant could see

471
00:30:41,021 --> 00:30:44,890
whether all four feet were off the ground
in solve the bed. Here's the problem.

472
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:47,470
Cameras in those days were very slow.

473
00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:51,580
Fast exposure would be maybe
a second or several seconds.

474
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:56,320
My vision was going to push photography
to suddenly be able to capture motion in

475
00:30:56,321 --> 00:30:58,870
a 500th of a second.
Otherwise you just got blur.

476
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:10,490
Imagine that first step out of the world
of a blur when Brechin stretched a wire

477
00:31:10,491 --> 00:31:14,510
across the race track and attached it
to the shutter mechanism on his camera.

478
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:18,560
Oxidant the horse gallops
by trips. The wire

479
00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:22,250
[inaudible]

480
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:23,780
which freezes the horse.

481
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:27,610
Nick gala steals him right
out of the flow of time.

482
00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:31,860
Except my bridge doesn't
just take one photo.

483
00:31:31,861 --> 00:31:36,120
He takes 24 c it place
24 cameras in a line,

484
00:31:36,121 --> 00:31:40,860
one after the other with 24 trip wires
stretching across the racetrack and the

485
00:31:40,861 --> 00:31:41,700
horse strip. Every one.

486
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:43,143
Yeah,

487
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:52,340
24 frozen and blurry running horses.
So what did, what did they see?

488
00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:53,121
Well,

489
00:31:53,121 --> 00:31:56,570
the pictures formed a series of a horse
running and some of those photos showed

490
00:31:57,050 --> 00:31:58,820
oxidant yes, with all
four feet off the ground.

491
00:31:58,910 --> 00:32:01,940
So the camera here unlocks a secret.

492
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:05,000
It let's just see something you could
never see before because this camera

493
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:07,460
essentially it stops time. Exactly.

494
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:11,330
Meanwhile it says Rebecca Bridge became
fascinated with learning more secrets of

495
00:32:11,331 --> 00:32:12,164
time,

496
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:17,780
secrets, lacking signs, basic
human movements. A leap, a splash,

497
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:21,170
a walk of parallel, wet. Wow. Mundane.

498
00:32:21,171 --> 00:32:24,310
But they're so enchanted when you
really pay attention to them. Yeah.

499
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:26,120
Bridge had photograph rushing water.

500
00:32:26,121 --> 00:32:29,560
He was obsessed with water and his
landscape pictures. So he, obsessive.

501
00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:33,500
Lee has people pour water, splash
water, pour water over themselves,

502
00:32:33,501 --> 00:32:36,890
poor pictures of water,
pour water into glasses,

503
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:40,130
splash water out of
basins, bathe in water.

504
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:43,550
And you can see all these
droplets frozen in midair.

505
00:32:47,770 --> 00:32:48,980
There's one particular photo, Robert,

506
00:32:48,981 --> 00:32:53,660
where you see a sheet of water suspended
in the air, hovering over the splasher.

507
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:59,900
Kind of like a ghost. Hmm. Oh Wow. Anyhow,

508
00:33:00,290 --> 00:33:02,930
take all those frozen moments and align
them one after the other and play them

509
00:33:02,931 --> 00:33:07,700
back. And you've got flow
again, albeit artificial flow,

510
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:08,780
which we call movies.

511
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:14,310
[inaudible] movies are
good. Yeah. Yeah. But

512
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:17,770
the next time you're feeling stressed
out, you saved yourself. I'm stressed.

513
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:19,720
I need to go to a movie to relax. Well,

514
00:33:19,721 --> 00:33:23,650
you should know that the technology that
made the movies is exactly the thing

515
00:33:23,651 --> 00:33:26,110
which spin up the pace of modern
life, which stressed you out,

516
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:28,880
which led you to go to the movies.
What does that mean? What did,

517
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:29,810
what do you mean by that? Well,

518
00:33:30,610 --> 00:33:33,760
one of the first ways movies were
used was to film factory workers doing

519
00:33:33,761 --> 00:33:38,290
repetitive tasks and then find out how
to make those tasks more efficient.

520
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:42,260
So if I were pushing the lever,
maybe too slowly is this right?

521
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:46,240
They would find the guy who did it the
right way, film him, slow the film down,

522
00:33:46,241 --> 00:33:50,140
and then use that to teach everyone
else. And then when World War II came,

523
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,630
this was not just now in
the cause of efficiency,

524
00:33:52,631 --> 00:33:55,630
this was a life or death matter.
Cause this is how you beat Nazis.

525
00:33:57,740 --> 00:34:00,700
All the scientific devices
of chronology. I'm a,

526
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:05,280
the manufacturing time in
all hands means victory.

527
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:09,370
And all hands must be as we learned
with our hands, hadn't [inaudible]

528
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:15,970
or there's a whole nother
way to think about this.

529
00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:21,270
Time can be a weapon in battle or it
can be the most sensuous and subtle and

530
00:34:24,341 --> 00:34:25,660
natural thing in the world.

531
00:34:25,661 --> 00:34:29,890
And I learned about this from a book by
Jay Griffiths called a sideways look at

532
00:34:29,891 --> 00:34:32,980
time. Let me just take a
stop here at the clocks.

533
00:34:33,010 --> 00:34:35,500
Even though you don't like clocks because
there's so many cool clocks in your

534
00:34:35,501 --> 00:34:39,970
book. First of all, there's a spice clock.

535
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:45,880
Yes, we're used to clocks,

536
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,120
which you can see when it's
really dark and it's seen.

537
00:34:48,121 --> 00:34:51,570
And you can see that you've just woken
up at two 35 and you really didn't want

538
00:34:51,571 --> 00:34:54,540
to wake up at two 35 but of
course for a long time, you know,

539
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:59,250
in the night you don't have a
way of seeing what the time is.

540
00:34:59,251 --> 00:35:03,480
And so somebody invented a spice cock
so you could taste your way through the

541
00:35:03,481 --> 00:35:06,000
nights. So there would be
maybe kind of, you know,

542
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:09,270
cinnamon for about one o'clock
in Turmeric for two o'clock.

543
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:13,260
You're sitting there in bed and you
stiff the time. Oh, you could taste it

544
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:23,060
right. How about the clock of birds?
This is the [inaudible] supporters. This

545
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:24,960
is lovely. The clearly people
apart when you're getting,

546
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:27,150
they have what they call
a clock of birds. Um,

547
00:35:27,151 --> 00:35:31,110
and that certain birds like the um, New
Guinea fryer bird and the hooded butch,

548
00:35:31,111 --> 00:35:33,040
but when they sing in the mornings,

549
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:38,120
the children are taught to understand
that that's a signal to get up and leave

550
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:40,043
the house.

551
00:35:45,370 --> 00:35:48,490
When those birds sing,
that late afternoon calls,

552
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:51,460
that's a signal to the
children to go back home.

553
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:58,600
Just a forest in the central highlands
in Papua New Guinea. I've been,

554
00:35:58,601 --> 00:36:02,530
that is a very, very difficult
place to be in once it's dog.

555
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:06,930
And that the children would need to know
at what time to start heading for home.

556
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:15,190
[inaudible] now, how about it's 1751

557
00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:20,430
Carl Linnaeus famous catalog.
Categorize her of everything. Yes.

558
00:36:21,090 --> 00:36:24,050
Our clock. What do you make it?
A flower clock so that you could,

559
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:28,040
you could see by the blooming of
different flowers. Um, what time?

560
00:36:28,041 --> 00:36:31,670
It was some kind of something that blooms
in the morning and then folds up like

561
00:36:31,671 --> 00:36:32,091
a morning.

562
00:36:32,091 --> 00:36:36,080
Glory would be there in the morning and
then in the evening and evening primrose

563
00:36:36,081 --> 00:36:36,840
would come out. Yeah.

564
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:39,860
These are all plants that opened
for an hour or two and then close.

565
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:45,440
So if you're walking by and you see a
blush of let's say pink, then you know,

566
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:47,780
oh, it must be in the morning. Or
if you say blush of Privilege, Oh,

567
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:50,660
it must be lunchtime or whatever
it is. Yes, exactly. Exactly.

568
00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:54,480
That's by the way, very, very good
gardening to be able to do that. Yes,

569
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,840
isn't it? Isn't it? And connected to that.

570
00:36:56,841 --> 00:37:00,680
There's also the Andaman forests and the
Andaman islands in the Indian nation.

571
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:03,650
Um, that people have a sense calendar,

572
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:06,230
which I find the most
beautiful idea because some,

573
00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:11,530
what it was is a way of kind of describing
the months by the sense of certain

574
00:37:11,901 --> 00:37:13,010
fruits and flowers.

575
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:21,700
Okay. Time at time is everywhere
in nature. What I put,

576
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:24,500
one of the things I wanted to do with
the hope book was to say, you know,

577
00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:27,320
we think of time thing to do with
clocks. In fact, for most of the world,

578
00:37:27,321 --> 00:37:31,460
for most of history time has been
absolutely embedded in nature in some

579
00:37:31,461 --> 00:37:32,420
beautiful ways.

580
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:43,930
Thanks Robert. [inaudible] Robert Krulwich
tonight we'll be back in a moment.

581
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:48,520
You're listening to radio on New
York public radio, public radioW

582
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:51,010
and why

583
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:00,200
[inaudible]

584
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:05,200
so that was a chunk of the
first thing we ever podcast.

585
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:07,640
It was a show about time and

586
00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:13,730
it's in honor of our 50th birthday. And
because there's, it's funny, Robert,

587
00:38:13,731 --> 00:38:18,020
like there's, we just looked at the
[inaudible] at our RSS feed recently,

588
00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:21,890
which access is, um, it's a, I
don't know what it stands for,

589
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:23,840
but it's the thing that like feeds iTunes.

590
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:27,740
So when you go on iTunes and you see
all the episodes, you sort of see what,

591
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:32,000
what's there and there's some limit
that's that iTunes places on the number of

592
00:38:32,001 --> 00:38:36,130
items that you can have in the feed. Oh.
And there I think it's a hundred or 150

593
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:36,700
or something.

594
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:41,650
And we realized like 150 early
episodes have fallen off the feed.

595
00:38:41,770 --> 00:38:42,940
Oh really? Yeah.

596
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:46,450
We were a backlist like at random
house that would be like Hemingway and

597
00:38:46,451 --> 00:38:48,850
Fitzgerald had fallen
onto the floor. Exactly.

598
00:38:48,851 --> 00:38:51,700
So like these huge number of
old episodes have fallen off.

599
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:55,930
And I started looking at that list and
on that list are some episodes that are

600
00:38:55,931 --> 00:38:59,920
weirdly relevant now at a whole bunch
that are just completely not relevant.

601
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,200
And, uh, I was like, I, you know,

602
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:06,690
I think I want to pull some of
those back into the flow and, uh,

603
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:11,620
because it'll give us a chance to like
sorta just reframe them and rethink about

604
00:39:11,621 --> 00:39:12,520
them and update them.

605
00:39:12,521 --> 00:39:15,250
And sometimes the science gets
old and needs to be updated,

606
00:39:15,251 --> 00:39:19,540
but sometimes design gets refreshed by
something that's happening in the real

607
00:39:19,541 --> 00:39:23,160
world. Yeah. Something, it gets
on a certain urgency. Yeah. So I,

608
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:25,530
so what the plan would
be is maybe, you know,

609
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:30,490
in the coming months we would go way
back for us, which is like 14, 13,

610
00:39:30,491 --> 00:39:31,240
15,

611
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:35,650
12 years back and resurrect things and
throw them out and see who wants to take

612
00:39:35,651 --> 00:39:39,230
a smack at them now and whether
there's things have changed. Yeah.

613
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:43,960
And whether they, whether they're
more interesting or, or utterly wrong.

614
00:39:43,961 --> 00:39:48,400
Now we're all wrong in a fascinating
way. Yeah. That kind of thing. Yeah.

615
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:52,000
That's the advantage of getting old as
you can. That's true. Yeah. That's true.

616
00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:56,100
You can play with your memories. Exactly.

617
00:39:56,760 --> 00:40:00,400
You can not be a rabbit. There
you go. All right, well that was,

618
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:01,920
that was something,

619
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:06,970
and thanks for listening.
