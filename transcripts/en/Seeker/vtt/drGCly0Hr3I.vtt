00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.940
You can send just about anything by air these
days, from letters to spacecraft.

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:09.350
Which means cargo planes have to come in lots
of shapes and sizes… but what’s the real

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:11.100
difference here?

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.900
It’s you.

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:20.480
So let’s start with what we know: a commercial
passenger flight.

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.020
And to be honest, you all are heavy.

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:28.070
Depending on the plane, a passenger flight
can have anywhere between 150 and 400 people

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:33.760
who weigh a lot; the average American woman
weighs 169 pounds (77kg) while the average

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.390
man weighs 196 pounds (89kg).

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.030
Take out the people and that plane is a lot
lighter.

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.920
3With no people or their luggage or little
dogs or babies, and there’s no need for

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.470
seats!

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:48.900
Seats are getting lighter with new materials
like polyester mesh.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.900
And newly designed features mean seats made
of titanium can weigh less than 10 pounds

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.399
(4.5kg), But still, lose those too.

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:59.690
So no people and no seats means no one to
look out the windows, so they’re also unnecessary

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:00.930
on cargo planes.

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.650
Taking out the windows lowers the overall
mass, making the plane more fuel efficient.

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:07.900
And that’s the goal when carrying cargo.

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.200
Replacing windows with aluminum panels or
another kind of window plug can make things

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.899
way lighter, but even better is never having
had windows at all.

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:19.549
There’s no support structure to deal with
around the hole in the plane, and there’s

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:21.319
less drag on the smoother fuselage.

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:25.689
Since you aren’t walking around the plane
we can change out the floor and lose the carpet

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:26.689
too.

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:30.889
Freight aircraft have floors that promote
easy onloading and offloading of cargo palettes,

00:01:30.889 --> 00:01:33.159
often with ball bearings or rollers.

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:37.090
Converting a plane from a passenger jet to
a cargo plane by taking out all these things

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.109
is far cheaper than buying a new plane, so
that’s why you see freight planes with window

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:44.209
outlines and other features that look like
passenger planes.

00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:48.689
Though it’s not the case that a plane carries
either passengers or cargo.

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:54.090
The US Postal Service leases space on about
15,000 of the 25,000 or so passenger flights

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.799
scheduled each day.

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.069
And some flights can even be configured such
that half the cabin compartment holds people

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:02.289
and the other half cargo.

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:06.950
But there are planes built specifically for
cargo, largely to support the increasing demand

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.459
for worldwide shipping.

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.790
Some basic models come from the factory ready
to haul as much as five semi truck’s worth

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:13.920
of cargo.

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.080
There are some interesting specializations
out there.

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.800
The door on cargo planes, for example.

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.140
Most, have the traditional cargo doors that
we see on passenger jets though cut into different

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:28.310
parts of the plane for the sake of cargo loading,
but for bigger loads there are special doors.

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.939
Like freighter-planes that open at the nose,
allowing the plane to take cargo like cars

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:37.469
Or like the Boeing DreamLifter, of which there
are only four, that opens at the tail allowing

00:02:37.469 --> 00:02:41.020
it to carry fuselage sections for smaller
airplanes.

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:42.560
Airplanes hauling airplanes.

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.480
That’s so cool.

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.670
Another thing you might notices are propellers.

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:52.250
Most modern cargo planes are jet powered like
passenger planes, but a few are turbo-prop-driven.

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.530
Prop planes have more propulsive energy, and
are more fuel efficient which, again, is great

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:57.530
for hauling cargo.

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.350
But at the end of the day, regardless of whether
a plane is flying you or a rocket stage across

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:05.220
the country, it still flies the same way.

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:10.760

Next time you’re on a flight look at the
wings, they shake sometimes, right?

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:18.849
Why don’t they fall off?

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:20.920
Trace can tell you here.

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.980
One super cool prop cargo plane is NASA’s
Super Guppy, made of a modified fuselage of

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.370
a Boeing C-97 Stratofreighter.

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:34.790
It carries spacecraft and rocket segments
around the country.
