00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:05.070
Okay. Let's see how you did with the concept map. We know that there are two

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:08.280
copies of the human genome in every cell,

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.420
and cells make up tissues, which make up organs,

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.800
which make up the body. Cells, tissues, organs,

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:20.510
and the body together Manifest traits, which are influenced

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:22.260
by the human genome. And we learned a

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.340
bit about traits in lesson one. So the human

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:30.680
genome resides in the cell, and it can be divided into the nuclear genome

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.400
and the mitochondrial genome. The mitochondrial genome

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.310
has one circular chromosome per mitochondria, and there

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:41.130
are many mitochondria per cell. Now the

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:44.090
nuclear genome there's only one nucleus and

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.040
one nuclear genome per cell. But each

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.410
nuclear genome contains 23 pairs of linear chromosomes,

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:54.290
22 pairs are called the autosomes. They're

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.620
numbered based on their size from 1-22. One

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.200
being the biggest and 22 being the smallest. But one pair of the 23 pairs of

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.330
chromosomes are called sex chromosomes. And these determine

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.430
the sex of the individual. Two X chromosomes

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:15.380
will develop as a female, and then X and Y chromosome will develop as a male.

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.240
All chromosomes in a cell are made

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.639
of nucleic acid wrapped around histone proteins.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.920
Now there are two different types of nucleic acid, and one of them, DNA, is

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.400
what makes up chromosomes. The other type,

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.590
RNA, we'll learn more about in lesson three.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:37.070
DNA is composed of deoxynucleotides. There are

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.420
four different types of deoxynucleotides that all differ

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:45.540
in which nitrogenous base they contain. There's adenine, or A, which can base

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:53.200
pair with thymine, or T. And cytosine, or C, can base pair with guanine, or G.

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:56.860
Now DNA is double-stranded and comes in

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.570
a helical shape. But the double-stranded nature

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:01.820
of DNA is held together by base

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.270
pairs. Which are formed by the nitrogenous bases.

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:13.490
And one human genome, one copy, is made of 3 billion base pairs of DNA.
