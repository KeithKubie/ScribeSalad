00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:11.270
It's easy to say that "superheroes don't kill"
and believe it, since comic book publishers

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:14.590
usually prefer the good guys to find better
solutions than murder.

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:18.470
But as writers and trends passed, some of
the comic world's most iconic superheroes

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:20.680
have delivered some insane kills.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.300
Whether they turn your stomach, or give you
a cold chill, even the brightest heroes have

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.300
their dark side.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.130
Here are 5 Superheroes With Shockingly Deadly
Dark Sides.

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.200
Wolverine
On the comic book page, live-action movies,

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.980
or even cartoon TV shows, Wolverine has proven
to be one of the most ruthless and efficient

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:38.280
killers in the Marvel Universe.

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.960
Honestly, it would be hard to even know how
many lives Logan has ended with his razor

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.160
sharp claws alone.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.800
But not every kill Wolverine makes is a righteous
one.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.680
In "Ultimate X-Men #41," a young boy learns
that developing a mutant power isn't always

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:51.790
a dream come true.

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:56.790
Instead of a superpower, he gets a curse,
causing every person, family member, friend,

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.469
and even dog around him to burst into flames,
and burn to ash.

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:02.750
It isn't long until Wolverine tracks him down.

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.079
Cracking a beer, Logan tells him there's no
cure his mutation, and even worse, nobody

00:01:07.079 --> 00:01:11.540
can ever find out that a mutant could kill
over 200 people by accident, or they wouldn't

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:12.810
even trust the X-Men.

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.020
Since the boy can't go on living, there's
only one thing to do.

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.640
Readers only get to see Wolverine exit the
cave, but it's obvious he put the innocent

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.200
boy down before he could kill again.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.860
It might be the so-called hero's most haunting
kill, and more than any other, raises questions

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.759
about what being a hero really means when
lives are on the line.

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:33.749
Green Lantern
DC's space cop may have disappointed at the

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:37.649
box office, but in the comics, his story is
even stranger.

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:42.679
During the ultra-gritty and violent era of
1990s comics, DC decided that the best way

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:46.389
to get Green Lantern back in the headlines
was to do something shocking, just like the

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:49.079
Death of Superman had sparked new interest
in the Man of Steel.

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:53.209
The answer was to go the opposite route: where
Superman died, Green Lantern would become

00:01:53.209 --> 00:01:54.509
a mass murderer.

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:55.509
Really.

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:58.799
After his entire city was wiped off the face
of the Earth, Hal Jordan didn't take long

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.279
to let his anger loose on the Green Lantern
Corps, setting his sights on the Guardians,

00:02:02.279 --> 00:02:04.100
his all-powerful bosses.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.429
Hal sliced through dozens, hundreds, thousands
of other Lanterns on his way to Oa, killing

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:08.800
all but one Guardian.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.180
Taking the new name Parallax and some shiny
new armor, Hal was as crazy a villain as you

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:14.180
could imagine.

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.510
Luckily, he died before he could succeed in
destroying the universe, and DC later explained

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.850
his madness away as an infection from a galactic
fear parasite.

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.980
But whatever the reason, Hal Jordan became
one of DC's most prolific serial killers in

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.120
a matter of hours.

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.810
Spider-Man
It seems like even the funniest superheroes

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.010
get their darker stories, and for Spider-Man,
it came in the form of "Reign," a limited

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.200
miniseries taking plenty of influences from
Frank Miller's "Dark Knight Returns."

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.370
Set in an alternate future when Peter Parker
is close to 70, and long retired from the

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.380
job, the former webslinger returns to the
streets when crime gets out of hand.

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.430
But it's the death of Mary Jane Watson that
keeps him up at night.

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.940
It's bad enough that Peter leaves Mary Jane
dying in a hospital to foil a crime, but as

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.280
the story goes on, readers learned that Peter
was responsible for her death... in the worst

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.280
way possible.

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.740
You see, the doctors can't figure out why
MJ is dying of radiation poisoning, but Peter

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:08.190
can... since his blood - and ALL his bodily
fluids - are radioactive.

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:13.760
That's right, in the darkest, creepiest, most
unsettling Spider-Man story we know of, Peter

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.660
Parker's decision not to use protection killed
his wife.

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.870
Still not shocked or convinced this was Peter
Parker's worst murder, no matter what the

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:20.870
future holds?

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.710
Look no further than him comparing her illness
to spider eggs hatching inside of her, spreading

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:27.160
cancer throughout her body.

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.590
Superman
Man of Steel took plenty of heat for showing

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:34.230
Superman killing his enemy, but ask a die-hard
DC fan, and they'll tell you that "Superman

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.960
doesn't kill" isn't exactly true, since more
than a few people and enemies have fallen

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:38.960
at his hands.

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:43.319
But no kill is stranger, or harder to believe,
than the one taking place on an alternate

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:45.860
world the Man of Steel accidentally stumbled
upon.

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:49.950
On this parallel Earth, three Kryptonians
sentenced to the Phantom Zone escaped their

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:51.690
prison to wreak havoc on Earth - and they
did.

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:56.420
By wiping out the atmosphere, the villains,
General Zod among them - managed to kill 5

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:58.140
BILLION souls in a matter of minutes.

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.380
In a strange departure from his usual character,
Superman immediately decides that he has no

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:05.750
choice but to act as judge, jury, and executioner.

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:12.459
Sentencing the three to excruciating death,
exposing them to green kryptonite.

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:15.910
It's a scene you wouldn't believe was actually
real, but after burying the three aliens and

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:20.380
returning to his own Earth, the murder, just
or not, haunted Supes for years in the form

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.900
of disembodied spirits tormenting his mind.

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.570
Captain America
We know what you're thinking: since he started

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:31.110
his comic career as a soldier in World War
2, it's no fair to call Captain America a

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:32.110
killer.

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.389
While his wartime kills can mostly be written
off, murdering people turned out to be a hard

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:39.009
habit for Cap to kick, since he was getting
in trouble for killing suspects in even modern

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:43.150
times

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:47.340
But to see Cap's worst streaks of killing,
look no further than Marvel's Cinematic Universe.

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.979
Even if we pretend that smashing the edge
of a metal shield made from Earth's toughest

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:54.081
metal into someone's skull isn't enough to
kill them - even without super strength - it

00:04:54.081 --> 00:04:58.720
doesn't explain Cap's desire to throw normal
soldiers to their deaths from flying aircraft,

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:03.620
riddle them with machine gun rounds, or just
snap their alien necks (bank fight pre-explosion

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.639
in The Avengers).

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:09.210
He may not be any deadlier than his fellow
Avengers, but since he's supposed to be the

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:13.889
poster boy for America's honorable soldiers,
the wake of dead bodies he leaves behind him

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:16.620
is a little unexpected, whether they're bad
guys or not.

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:19.979
Those are just a few of the deadlier sides
of some of our favorite heroes, and we hope

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:23.930
you'll agree that the weirder the stories
or more out of place the bloodlust, the easier

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:28.090
it is to appreciate these characters as the
weird heroic murderers they really are.
