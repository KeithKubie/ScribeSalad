00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.040
Hey it's me Destin, welcome back to Smarter Every Day. So have you ever seen something in your life

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:08.090
that was so incredibly beautiful that you just did not understand how it could exist

00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:12.120
in this physical world with you. And the more you get close to it,

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:16.150
the more you study it, the more you understand that the depths of its beauty seem to never end.

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.170
There's layer upon layer upon layer of beauty. Now I know you might have

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:24.230
a hard time understanding this because you've never met my wife, but I'll show you something that gave me

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.250
a similar reaction. When I was in the Amazon rainforest I saw butterflies in ways

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:32.300
I had never seen them before. So when I got back home I started to research them and found

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.340
that they were of the order of Lepidoptera, which is ancient Greek for scaled wing.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.400
Now what do butterflies have to do with scales? Like fish scales.

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.450
If you've ever caught a butterfly by the wings then afterwards looked at your finger, you'll notice this shimmery dust.

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:48.480
Those are scales, and they're really really tiny.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.500
Now I know a lot of you are smarter than me, and you knew that butterfly wings had scales, but I didn't.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.520
And so I started researching it, and I found this.

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.570
The most beautiful image I have ever seen on the internet. This is a microscopic image

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.580
of a moth in Madagascar called a sunset moth.

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.600
It's amazing. Look at this. I mean these scales are an organic structure.

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:12.640
They were created by a caterpillar that dissolved himself in a pupa. Think about that.

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:16.680
So you know me. The next step was to call Dr Linden Gledhill and ask him to teach me

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.740
the black art of taking photos of butterfly scales. We bought a microscope from the 80s

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.770
and Linden used the internet to teach my wife, who has a degree in biology, how to use the microscope.

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.780
After that I coupled a camera to it, and then I bought some butterflies from the internet.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.830
I'll leave the links below. So the scales of the sunset moth are the color

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.870
of the rainbow but the one spot that I want to get is right there where there's blues and

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.900
purples and they meet the yellows and the greens. That's what I'm after.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.940
So once we explore a little bit we can find the purples right here but we have a problem.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.990
If you'll notice, not all the scales are in focus at any one time. What we're gonna have to do

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:53.020
is we're gonna have to take multiple photos along that depth of field and add them all up

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.060
so we get one focused image. OK I'm gonna show you exactly how this works.

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.110
I've got this over my face so I don't breathe on the butterfly wing and move it while I'm taking the images.

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.150
You can see I've got the microscope setup with a remote trigger. I've got a diffuser

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.200
on my main objective there and I've got two lights going through that diffuser.

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.220
You can see on my clock there it's 10:06 and we're about to start

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.240
and you can see how long this takes. Here we go.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.280
[music]

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.360
OK so what time is it?

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.390
It is 10:16, so it took me about 10 minutes to do that. So I took all those images

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.410
and now I'm gonna use photoshop to align the images and then I'm gonna stack

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.420
them together so I have a much deeper depth of field. This is the fun part.

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.440
This is where we get to see all this time that we put in, yield something very very beautiful.

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.510
[music]

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.640
So we started this journey together learning about layers of beauty right?

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.700
And think about it. The fact that there are scales on butterfly wings and that they are beautiful is beautiful within itself.

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.750
But it's not that that I want you to see. It's the layering of the beautiful.

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:29.810
Think about it. This caterpillar, before he went inside the pupa,

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:33.860
he took with him a body that he dissolved and he used that organic

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.890
matter to rearrange it somehow with a software load that he took into the pupa with him

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:41.930
to create a beautiful wing with a color structure laid out in a specific

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:45.950
pattern. I mean how did that software load know to make this scale

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.990
one color and this scale another color? It boggles the mind, and it's one of the

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.040
most beautiful things I've ever seen. In fact, it's the second most beautiful thing I've ever seen.

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.080
What do you think is so beautiful about butterfly scales?

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:02.120
- That they change colors and all of them are not the same color.

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:06.140
- Oh they're not? So what do you have here?
- A sign that has my name on it.

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:10.190
- That's pretty isn't it. There was a guy back in 1960,

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:14.210
his name was Kjell Sandved, he was a Norwegian photographer, and he came over to the US and he searched

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.290
for perfect butterfly wings that would give him all the alphanumeric characters.

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:22.310
So he created a library of all these images.

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:26.350
You can see he's got multiple E's, multiple Y's. He created this library and you can

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:30.410
go and make your own name. I'll leave a link in the video description. OK I stumbled upon something

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.450
pretty cool so this'll be the last thing I show you. See here are all my butterflies and I took one of the

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:38.470
hind wings of this goliath birdwing and I placed it under my microscope there.

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:42.480
So we're gonna go up here and we're gonna turn the video on in the scope, you can see it's black there.

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:46.510
And then I'm gonna turn the light on. Watch what happens. It's orange.

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:50.540
Now that's interesting because the butterfly wing itself is green.

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.560
What's happening? Now check this out. It gets even weirder.

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:58.620
If I take this top down light and turn it on, look at that.

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:02.670
I'll turn that back light off. Green. So if I have light transmitted from the bottom of the

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:06.720
wing I get this orange color, however if it's reflected from the top of the wing I get

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:10.720
a different color solution altogether. What's happening there? So if I've earned your subscription

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:14.750
please consider checking out the next video which is me going to a biological imaging lab at Georgia State University.

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:18.780
Good grief, they gave me goggles that look like this. Clearly we're gonna do some awesome science

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.810
in that video. I hope you enjoyed that and I want to share something with you. While I was making this video

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:26.890
I read this book, The Fault in our Stars by my friend John Green. Now while I was

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:30.960
flying, I used broken butterflies as a bookmark which ended up being a metaphor for

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:35.010
how the book works. There's two people in it, Augustus and Hazel Grace, and they're broken people

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:39.030
with broken bodies, and they're trying to experience a broken world. And they do so

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:43.080
together by unlocking the layers of beauty in the world around them.

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:47.110
Anyway, I think you'll enjoy it and if you want it for free you can download it at audible.com/smarter.

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:51.150
The Fault in our Stars, go check out John Green's book.

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:55.190
I think you'll like it. Anyway, I'm Destin. You're getting Smarter Every Day.

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:59.210
Have a good one. Just because it's cool I want to see the scales actually on my fingerprint. It's pretty awesome.

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:03.260
So I took a lot of photos obviously. If you want to download them and use them as a desktop background

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:07.310
or something like that I'll put them up on the Smarter Every Day Facebook page. There's a lot of stuff there

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:11.330
you can check out. Thanks. What are you doing, some schoolwork?
- We are.

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:15.370
- Where are those earrings I bought you?
- They're in my closet. I look awful.

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:19.440
I feel awful. I don't feel good.
- Can you put em on real quick?

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:23.460
You know what it is?
- nuh uh
- It's a sunset moth.

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:27.480
You know why I got you those?
- Why? Cause you're doing a video on it.

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:28.520
- No, you'll find out.
