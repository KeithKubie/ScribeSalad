00:00:02.526 --> 00:00:04.116
&gt;&gt;Daniel Goleman: There
are three kinds of focus.

00:00:04.116 --> 00:00:08.136
One is inner focus, being aware
of our thoughts, of our feelings.

00:00:08.136 --> 00:00:12.086
This is the basis for being
able to manage our inner world.

00:00:12.166 --> 00:00:14.426
For a child, this is
extremely important.

00:00:14.426 --> 00:00:16.076
It's called cognitive control.

00:00:16.206 --> 00:00:21.326
Cognitive control means that you can
see when you're about to do something

00:00:21.326 --> 00:00:24.856
that maybe you shouldn't and
stop before you do it, not after.

00:00:25.076 --> 00:00:28.516
In a landmark study of more than
1,000 children who were followed

00:00:28.516 --> 00:00:30.806
from age four into their 30s,

00:00:30.876 --> 00:00:33.656
cognitive control was
a better predictor

00:00:33.656 --> 00:00:37.946
of a child's financial
success and health in their 30s

00:00:38.216 --> 00:00:42.056
than was either their IQ or the
wealth of the family they grew up in.

00:00:42.266 --> 00:00:45.406
The second kind of focus is empathy.

00:00:45.616 --> 00:00:46.906
It's an other focus.

00:00:46.906 --> 00:00:50.486
It's focusing on that other person
and understanding their inner world,

00:00:50.556 --> 00:00:52.176
their thoughts, their feelings.

00:00:52.176 --> 00:00:53.896
The third is an outer focus.

00:00:53.896 --> 00:00:59.676
Being able to sense and understand
the larger systems that impact

00:00:59.676 --> 00:01:03.566
and shape our lives, whether it's
the dynamics in an organization,

00:01:03.756 --> 00:01:07.676
whether it's a school or a
business or larger systems

00:01:07.676 --> 00:01:11.706
like the global systems that
support life and how human activity,

00:01:11.706 --> 00:01:14.726
how our choices of what
we buy and do can help

00:01:14.726 --> 00:01:16.846
or harm those larger systems.
