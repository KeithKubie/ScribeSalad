00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.300
Since our shaded area of values for y ends in an arrow pointing to the left, the

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:08.735
lower limit of this interval is negative infinity. There is no lower limit, in

00:00:08.735 --> 00:00:13.212
other words. We can see that the interval ends at 30, with a square bracket, so

00:00:13.212 --> 00:00:17.563
30 is included in our interval. We know that this is the same as y is less than

00:00:17.563 --> 00:00:21.565
or equal to 30, which means that y can have any value that's either 30 or

00:00:21.565 --> 00:00:25.976
something lower than 30. And remember, we have to use this round parentheses

00:00:25.976 --> 00:00:28.665
next to our infinity, even it's a negative one.
