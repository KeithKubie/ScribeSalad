00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.366
Voiceover:Let's say that
you're throwing a party,

00:00:02.366 --> 00:00:04.433
and as we all know, any party needs

00:00:04.433 --> 00:00:06.266
a sufficient number of monkeys.

00:00:06.633 --> 00:00:08.733
Right now you have 10 monkeys.

00:00:08.767 --> 00:00:12.800
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.733
But you would like to have 18 monkeys.

00:00:17.233 --> 00:00:19.900
How many more monkeys do you need

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.000
in order to have 18 monkeys?

00:00:23.233 --> 00:00:24.833
I encourage you to pause the video and

00:00:24.833 --> 00:00:26.166
think about it on your own before

00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:27.333
I work through it.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.733
Remember, the goal here is to get to ...

00:00:32.566 --> 00:00:33.966
The goal here ...

00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:35.166
Let me write it this way.

00:00:35.166 --> 00:00:40.267
The goal here is to get to 18, 18 monkeys.

00:00:41.366 --> 00:00:43.466
Now what do we know about the number 18?

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.568
Well the number 18, you have this 1

00:00:47.568 --> 00:00:49.400
right over here in the tens place.

00:00:49.566 --> 00:00:53.200
That literally represents 1, 10.

00:00:54.233 --> 00:00:57.866
And then this 8 represents 8, 1's.

00:00:59.869 --> 00:01:02.133
Plus 8, 1's.

00:01:02.833 --> 00:01:05.266
That's the same thing as saying 1, 10 ...

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.466
1, 10, that's just a 10 right over there.

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.333
And 8, 1's, that's just 8.

00:01:10.766 --> 00:01:13.333
18 is the same thing as 10 plus 8.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.167
If we start with 10
monkeys, which is how many

00:01:17.167 --> 00:01:19.300
we have started with, how many more

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.266
do we need to get to 18?

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.500
Well, if you start at 10, you need 8 more

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.533
to get to 18.

00:01:28.033 --> 00:01:30.333
We can verify that visually, if we like.

00:01:30.566 --> 00:01:33.267
Let's see.

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.066
Let me copy and paste 1 of these monkeys.

00:01:36.766 --> 00:01:37.800
Copy.

00:01:37.966 --> 00:01:39.066
This is 10.

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.466
Now, let's get to 18.

00:01:41.166 --> 00:02:04.400
11, 12, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18.

00:02:04.701 --> 00:02:06.000
And 18.

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:07.800
How many more did we add?

00:02:08.033 --> 00:02:11.100
Well, once again, we started, we started

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.000
with this 10 right over here.

00:02:13.033 --> 00:02:14.333
Let me box them off.

00:02:15.033 --> 00:02:18.066
We started with these 10 monkeys.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.800
That's 1 group of 10 right over there.

00:02:22.567 --> 00:02:24.866
We started with the 10.

00:02:25.433 --> 00:02:27.600
And then we added 8 more monkeys.

00:02:27.767 --> 00:02:31.666
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

00:02:31.833 --> 00:02:37.400
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

00:02:37.633 --> 00:02:39.000
So we started with 10.

00:02:39.167 --> 00:02:41.133
We added 8 more monkeys.

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:47.800
We added 8 more monkeys
to get, to get to 18.

00:02:47.966 --> 00:02:49.633
And once again, how did we first think

00:02:49.633 --> 00:02:50.733
about that?

00:02:50.766 --> 00:02:54.600
Well, 18 is 1, 10 plus 8, 1's.

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.133
Or 10 plus 8.
