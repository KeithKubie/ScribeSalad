00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.700
If you’ve got a box of old batteries sitting
around your house, that’s not the worst

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:12.450
thing you could be doing with them.

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.290
Hello everyone and welcome to another episode
of DNews!

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:19.380
I’m Amy and you’re watching thanks to
the miracle of electricity, electricity we’ve

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.000
grown accustomed to carrying around with us
thanks to batteries.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.170
Electricity is what you get when electrons
flow through a conductive path like a wire

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:29.590
to create a circuit, and batteries play a
key role in that circuit.

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:34.480
A typical household battery like a AA battery
has three basic parts: the negatively charged

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.239
anode, the positively charged cathode, and
the electrolyte typically containing sulfuric

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:40.500
acid and water that sits in between them.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.269
The cathode and anode are the bits that touch
your device via the spring and little nobbly

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:46.570
bit in the battery well of, say, a flashlight.

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.179
They’re the pieces that close the electrical
circuit.

00:00:49.179 --> 00:00:53.339
The chemical reaction inside a battery causes
a build up of electrons at the anode which

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:56.719
causes a difference in electrical charge between
the anode and the cathode.

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:00.269
The electrons want to rearrange themselves
and balance out this charge, and so they repel

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:02.620
each other to get to where there are fewer
electrons.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.379
In a battery, that’s the cathode.

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.060
But the electrolyte in the battery stops the
electrons from just hopping over to the cathode,

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.970
so the only way the electrons can get to where
they want to go is to follow a circuit, say

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.730
though a wire that illuminates the bulb in
a flashlight, to get to where they want to

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:15.730
go.

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:16.730
So why do batteries die?

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:20.430
The electrochemical processes within a battery
actually change the anode and cathode to the

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.190
point where they stop supplying electrons.

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.610
When there are no more electrons, there’s
no more power in the battery.

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.790
Rechargeable batteries work by changing the
direction of the flow of electrons; the electrochemical

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.430
processes happen in reverse, restoring the
anode and cathode to their original states

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.140
and the battery to full power.

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.160
And here’s the big question: why exactly
can’t you throw a non-rechargeable battery

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.930
away once it’s dead?

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:44.320
Batteries are made from chemicals found in
minerals of heavy metals, minerals that can

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.770
be poisonous even in a very small amount.

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.521
You don't’ really want them sitting around
in your house, and you also don't want to

00:01:49.521 --> 00:01:52.580
throw them away into a landfill where they
can pose environmental risks.

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.640
It’s best to dispose of batteries properly
because if it’s done right batteries can

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.010
be almost or entirely recycled.

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.220
Recycling a battery is a multistage process.

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.820
First, the battery is broken apart by a hammer
mill such that the lead and heavier pieces

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.900
fall to the bottom and the lighter, plastic
pieces float.

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.120
The plastic pieces are washed, dried, and
sent to a plastic recycler.

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.849
The lead parts are cleaned and heated in a
smelting furnaces until it is molten.

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:18.370
That molten lead is then poured into ingot
molds and left to cool so the impurities float

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:19.370
to the top.

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.599
Once the impurities are scraped away, ingots
are left to cool completely before being remelted

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:25.830
and used to produce new batteries.

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.799
Battery acid is either neutralized and turned
into water or processed and converted to sodium

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:34.189
sulfate which can then be used in laundry
detergent, glass, and textile manufacturing.

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:37.329
What to do and where to go varies depending
on where you live and usually means asking

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:39.159
your local government what to do.

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:42.989
So how many of you hold on to your old batteries
until you can dispose of them properly?
