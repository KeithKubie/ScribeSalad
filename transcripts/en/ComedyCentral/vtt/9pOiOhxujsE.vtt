00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:04.580
&gt;&gt; Jon: WELCOME BACK.

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:07.213
FOR MORE ON THE GUN DEBATE WE

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:08.855
BRING YOU THE FIRST PART OF A

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:09.360
THREE-PART SERIES WITH JOHN

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:09.693
OLIVER.

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.602
&gt;&gt; YESTERDAY, AMERICANS WATCHED

00:00:11.602 --> 00:00:13.569
IN SHOCK AS EVEN WATERED DOWN

00:00:13.569 --> 00:00:15.280
GUN LEGISLATION DIE ON THE FLOOR

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:16.480
OF THE SENATE.

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.515
BUT THAT IS EXACTLY WHERE IT

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.400
BELONGS, ACCORDING TO GUN

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.368
LOBBYIST OF THE VIRGINIA

00:00:22.368 --> 00:00:23.628
CITIZENS DEFENSE LEAGUE.

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.947
&gt;&gt; THE SECOND AMENDMENT IS

00:00:26.947 --> 00:00:27.341
SACROSANCT.

00:00:27.341 --> 00:00:29.208
&gt;&gt; YOU HOLD THUP SIGN WHENEVER I

00:00:29.208 --> 00:00:30.935
MAKE A SUGGESTION THAT YOU THINK

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:32.342
IS INFRINGING UPON YOUR SECOND

00:00:32.342 --> 00:00:33.474
AMENDMENT RIGHTSES, OKAY?

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.140
&gt;&gt; OKAY.

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.692
&gt;&gt; ASSAULT WEAPON BAN.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:37.826
BOOM, THERE IT IS.

00:00:37.826 --> 00:00:39.054
INCREASED BACKGROUND CHECKS.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.455
REALLY?

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:41.794
&gt;&gt; YES.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.068
&gt;&gt; JUST FOR BACKGROUND CHECKS?

00:00:43.068 --> 00:00:44.528
&gt;&gt; WE DON'T DO BACKGROUND CHECKS

00:00:44.528 --> 00:00:45.888
FOR THE FIRST AMENDMENT.

00:00:45.888 --> 00:00:48.182
&gt;&gt; OKAY, SO LET'S JUST TRY THIS

00:00:48.182 --> 00:00:49.115
ONE, NICE AND EASY.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:49.487
&gt;&gt; SURE.

00:00:49.487 --> 00:00:51.548
&gt;&gt; A MANDATORY ONE-HOUR WAITING

00:00:51.548 --> 00:00:55.344
PERIOD IF YOU BUY A GUN.

00:00:55.344 --> 00:01:00.646
&gt;&gt; WHY-- WHY-- ( BLEEP ).

00:01:00.646 --> 00:01:01.800
&gt;&gt; UNLESS I CAN SEE A REASON.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.335
NO, I CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:04.274
THEY SUPPORT BECAUSE AT THE END

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.748
OF THE DAY, NONE OF IT WORKS.

00:01:05.748 --> 00:01:08.209
&gt;&gt; EXACTLY, GUN CONTROL DOES NOT

00:01:08.209 --> 00:01:08.501
WORK.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.120
WHAT IF HYPOTHETICALLY SPEAKING,

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.755
GUN CONTROL COULD WORK-- WHICH

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.862
OBVIOUSLY IT CAN'T SO WE KNOW IT

00:01:16.862 --> 00:01:18.395
WON'T SO THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM,

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.520
BUT WHAT IF IT DID.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.622
&gt;&gt; WHEN WAS THAT?

00:01:23.622 --> 00:01:24.462
&gt;&gt; AUSTRALIA.

00:01:24.462 --> 00:01:26.362
YES, AUSTRALIA INSPECT IN 1996,

00:01:26.362 --> 00:01:28.395
A CONSERVATIVE PRIME MINISTER

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.769
JOHN HOWARD INSTITUTED SWEEPING

00:01:30.769 --> 00:01:32.162
GUN CONTROL LAWS FOLLOWING A

00:01:32.162 --> 00:01:33.761
MASS SHOOTING THAT SHOCKED THE

00:01:33.761 --> 00:01:34.094
NATION.

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.434
SO SHOULD WE BE LEARNING FROM

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:36.675
THIS EFFECTIVE EXAMPLE?

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.633
OF COURSE NOT.

00:01:39.633 --> 00:01:41.134
&gt;&gt; I GUESS IF WE'RE GOING TO GO

00:01:41.134 --> 00:01:43.704
TO PLANET X. AND SAY IT'S NOT

00:01:43.704 --> 00:01:45.305
UNITED STATES, SOME OTHER

00:01:45.305 --> 00:01:46.907
PLANET, DIFFERENT PEOPLE,

00:01:46.907 --> 00:01:48.141
DIFFERENT EVERYTHING, I DON'T

00:01:48.141 --> 00:01:49.676
KNOW, YEAH, YOU KNOW, BUT IN THE

00:01:49.676 --> 00:01:50.978
REAL WORLD WITH HUMAN BEINGS

00:01:50.978 --> 00:01:53.647
IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK, AND GUN

00:01:53.647 --> 00:01:54.227
CONTROL ISN'T GOING TO WORK.

00:01:54.227 --> 00:01:55.722
&gt;&gt; UNFORTUNATELY NOT TONAL IS

00:01:55.722 --> 00:01:57.121
AUSTRALIA ACTUALLY IN THE REAL

00:01:57.121 --> 00:01:57.421
WORLD.

00:01:57.421 --> 00:02:00.589
EVEN THEIR ANINALS CAN HOIST A

00:02:00.589 --> 00:02:00.914
WEAPON.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.789
WHO IS RIGHT ABOUT GUN CONTROL?

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:04.348
THERE WAS ONLY ONE WAY TO FIND

00:02:04.348 --> 00:02:04.740
OUT.

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.575
CONFRONT THE MAN RESPONSIBLE.

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:08.168
MR. PRIME MINISTER, LET'S BEGIN

00:02:08.168 --> 00:02:10.768
IN THE FORMAL AUSTRALIAN WAY--

00:02:10.768 --> 00:02:11.760
G-DAY.

00:02:12.533 --> 00:02:13.667
&gt;&gt; HOW DO YOU DO.

00:02:13.667 --> 00:02:16.103
&gt;&gt; OBVIOUSLY, GUN CONTROL

00:02:16.103 --> 00:02:17.070
DOESN'T WORK.

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.871
IT CAN'T WORK.

00:02:17.871 --> 00:02:18.839
IT WILL NEVER WORK.

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:21.475
SO WOW WAS YOUR SCHEME A

00:02:21.475 --> 00:02:21.808
FAILURE?

00:02:21.808 --> 00:02:23.310
&gt;&gt; WELL, MY SCHEME WAS NOT A

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.644
FAILURE.

00:02:23.644 --> 00:02:27.681
WE HAD A MASSACRE AT PORT ARTHUR

00:02:27.681 --> 00:02:29.116
17 YEARS AGO, AND THERE HAVE

00:02:29.116 --> 00:02:30.250
BEEN NONE SINCE.

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.653
&gt;&gt; ZERO GUN MASS CERS.

00:02:32.653 --> 00:02:33.387
HOLD ON.

00:02:33.387 --> 00:02:35.622
DID GUN CONTROL ACTUALLY WORK?

00:02:35.622 --> 00:02:37.658
&gt;&gt; IT STOPPED ONE THING.

00:02:37.658 --> 00:02:40.594
THAT COULD ALSO BE A STATISTICAL

00:02:40.594 --> 00:02:40.961
ANOMALY.

00:02:40.961 --> 00:02:42.629
&gt;&gt; YEAH, IT WAS JUST MASS

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:43.230
SHOOTINGS DISAPPEARED.

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.466
&gt;&gt; THERE WERE SO FEW OF THEM,

00:02:46.466 --> 00:02:46.900
WHOOP-DEE-DO.

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.502
&gt;&gt; WHOOP-DEE-DO?

00:02:48.502 --> 00:02:51.839
&gt;&gt; YES THEIR SHOOTINGS ARE RARE

00:02:51.839 --> 00:02:52.172
ANYHOW.

00:02:52.172 --> 00:02:53.574
&gt;&gt; EXACTLY, THEY PROBABLY BARELY

00:02:53.574 --> 00:02:55.642
HAD A MASSACRE BEFORE 1996.

00:02:55.642 --> 00:02:57.945
&gt;&gt; THERE WERE ABOUT 13 IN THE

00:02:57.945 --> 00:02:58.712
PREVIOUS 18 YEARS.

00:02:58.712 --> 00:03:01.515
IN THE 18 YEARS BEFORE PORT

00:03:01.515 --> 00:03:04.051
ARTHUR, THERE WERE 13 MASS

00:03:04.051 --> 00:03:04.451
SHOOTINGS.

00:03:04.451 --> 00:03:05.118
ALMOST ONE A YEAR.

00:03:05.118 --> 00:03:07.588
&gt;&gt; I WAS UNAWARE THEY HAD THAT

00:03:07.588 --> 00:03:07.888
MANY.

00:03:07.888 --> 00:03:09.356
MASS BEING, WHAT, MORE THAN TWO

00:03:09.356 --> 00:03:10.390
PEOPLE AT A TIME?

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:11.325
&gt;&gt; MORE THAN FOUR.

00:03:11.325 --> 00:03:13.193
&gt;&gt; MORE THAN FOUR, OKAY.

00:03:13.193 --> 00:03:14.528
&gt;&gt; WHOOP-DEE-DO.

00:03:14.528 --> 00:03:18.599
&gt;&gt; PERHAPS THERE WERE OFFER

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:19.399
NON-WHOOP-DEE-DO SIDE EFFECTS.

00:03:19.399 --> 00:03:20.434
&gt;&gt; THE HOMICIDE RATE INVOLVING

00:03:20.434 --> 00:03:22.870
THE USE OF GUNS HAS DECLINED

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.105
SIGNIFICANTLY BY FACTORS OF UP

00:03:25.105 --> 00:03:26.940
TO 50% AND 60%, AND THE

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.476
INCIDENCE OF YOUTH SUICIDES

00:03:29.476 --> 00:03:32.913
INVOLVING GUNS HAS DECLINED

00:03:32.913 --> 00:03:33.347
DRAMATICALLY.

00:03:33.347 --> 00:03:39.553
&gt;&gt; WHOOP-DEE-( BLEEP )-DO.

00:03:39.553 --> 00:03:40.921
SUICIDE WITH GUNS WENT DOWN,

00:03:40.921 --> 00:03:42.422
ZERO MASS SHOOTINGS.

00:03:42.422 --> 00:03:45.392
&gt;&gt; AUSTRALIA STILL HAS MURDER

00:03:45.392 --> 00:03:47.427
RATES AND ROBBERIES LAST I

00:03:47.427 --> 00:03:47.761
CHECKED.

00:03:47.761 --> 00:03:49.496
&gt;&gt; UNLESS YOU CAN GET RID OF

00:03:49.496 --> 00:03:50.998
100% OF CRIME, IT'S NOT WORTH

00:03:50.998 --> 00:03:51.532
DOING AT ALL?

00:03:51.532 --> 00:03:53.567
&gt;&gt; PUT IT THIS WAY, IT'S ILLEGAL

00:03:53.567 --> 00:03:55.102
TO HAVE CRACK COCAINE ANYWHERE

00:03:55.102 --> 00:03:55.636
IN THE UNITED STATES.

00:03:55.636 --> 00:03:56.904
DO YOU THINK IF SOMEBODY REALLY

00:03:56.904 --> 00:03:58.105
WANTS IT THEY CAN GET THEIR

00:03:58.105 --> 00:04:00.174
HANDS ON CRACK COCAINE IN

00:04:00.174 --> 00:04:00.541
AMERICA?

00:04:00.541 --> 00:04:02.042
&gt;&gt; SO UNLESS WE CAN COMPLETELY

00:04:02.042 --> 00:04:03.443
GET RID OF DRUGS, THERE'S NO

00:04:03.443 --> 00:04:07.581
POINT IN HAVING DRUG LAWS AT

00:04:07.581 --> 00:04:08.282
ALL.

00:04:08.282 --> 00:04:08.682
( APPLAUSE )

00:04:08.682 --> 00:04:12.653
&gt;&gt; LET ME THINK ABOUT THAT FOR A

00:04:12.653 --> 00:04:14.188
MINUTE.

00:04:14.188 --> 00:04:16.123
WELL, I GUESS, EFFECTIVELY IT

00:04:16.123 --> 00:04:17.491
DOESN'T WORK.

00:04:17.491 --> 00:04:19.793
&gt;&gt; YOU CAN'T ARGUE WITH PHILLIP.

00:04:19.793 --> 00:04:21.728
EVEN HIS LOGIC IS BULLETPROOF.

00:04:21.728 --> 00:04:24.164
&gt;&gt; WELL, LET ME PUT IT TO YOU

00:04:24.164 --> 00:04:24.798
THIS WAY.

00:04:24.798 --> 00:04:28.735
THERE ARE MORE DROWN IN

00:04:28.735 --> 00:04:30.170
BACKYARDS WHERE THEY HAVE POOLS.

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:31.605
IF THERE ARE NO POOLS THEY DON'T

00:04:31.605 --> 00:04:32.840
HAVE A DROWNING IN THE BACKYARD.

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.241
THE U.S. HAS A VERY HIGH NUMBER

00:04:34.241 --> 00:04:35.075
OF GUNS.

00:04:35.075 --> 00:04:36.977
THEREFORE, THERE IS GOING TO BE

00:04:36.977 --> 00:04:38.612
MORE CHANCES FOR SOMEBODY TO BE

00:04:38.612 --> 00:04:39.880
KILLED WITH A GUN.

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.083
&gt;&gt; RIGHT.

00:04:43.083 --> 00:04:43.417
RIGHT.

00:04:43.417 --> 00:04:44.084
&gt;&gt; RIGHT.

00:04:44.084 --> 00:04:46.520
&gt;&gt; RIGHT.

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.089
THAT'S MY POINT.

00:04:49.089 --> 00:04:50.591
THE SENATE MIGHT THINK LIVING IN

00:04:50.591 --> 00:04:52.326
A SOCIETY WITH DRAMATICALLY

00:04:52.326 --> 00:04:55.462
REDUCED GUN VIOLENCE IS EYE

00:04:55.462 --> 00:04:56.830
WHO-DEE-DO, AND PEOPLE IN

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:57.865
AUSTRALIA COULDN'T AGREE WITH

00:04:57.865 --> 00:04:58.298
HIM MORE.

00:04:58.298 --> 00:04:59.800
&gt;&gt; WHOOP-DEE-DO.

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.469
&gt;&gt; WHOOP-DEE-DO, MATE.

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:05.239
&gt;&gt; WHOOP-DEE-DO, WHATEVER THAT

00:05:05.239 --> 00:05:05.572
MEANS.

00:05:05.572 --> 00:05:09.676
&gt;&gt; WHOOP-DEE-( BLEEP )-DO!

00:05:09.676 --> 00:05:10.677
&gt;&gt; Jon: WE'LL BE RIGHT
