that to design an instruction and that

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:16.359
that to design an instruction and that
 

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:18.090
that to design an instruction and that
approach is basically fundamentally

has been shown that a instructional

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:42.670
has been shown that a instructional
 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.540

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:03.389
where students have trouble breakdowns
in the learning process where the

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:03.399
in the learning process where the
 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:06.179
in the learning process where the
learning curve doesn't go down smoothly

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:06.189

in those cases we can identify flaws and

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179
in those cases we can identify flaws and
 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:13.500
in those cases we can identify flaws and
existing models and improve them and
