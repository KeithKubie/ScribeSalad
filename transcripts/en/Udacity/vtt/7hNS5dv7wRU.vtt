00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
This actually puts us in a really interesting situation.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
We can build a sorting algorithm

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
out of the pieces that we just created.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
This is sometimes called heap-sort. You give it a (L).

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
And what it does is it builds a heap out of (L),

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and then repeatedly, until there's no more elements left,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
it does remove.mn.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
So it gets the smallest and then the next smallest and then the next smallest

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
until the list is exhausted.
