00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.490
Melanie Klein was a highly creative and original
Viennese Jewish psychoanalyst who discovered

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.930
the work of Freud at the age of 32 and devoted
her life to enriching and nuancing it in intriguing

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:18.630
and valuable ways.

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.539
Born in 1882, Klein was held back by her father
from her desire to become a doctor and had

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:27.289
been pushed by her family into a loveless
marriage with a coarse, unpleasant man with

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:32.780
whom she had nothing in common. She was bored,
sexually frustrated and mentally unwell.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.530
Psychoanalysis saved her. She left her husband,
read everything she could, attended lectures,

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.920
and started publishing papers of her own.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.890
She soon departed from Freud in an area that
most other analysts had overlooked: the analysis

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:46.629
of children.

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:51.019
Freud had been sceptical that children could
ever be analysed properly, their minds being

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:54.929
in his view too unformed to allow for a perspective
on the unconscious.

00:00:54.929 --> 00:00:59.480
But Klein now argued that an analyst could
get a useable view into a child’s inner

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:04.070
world through studying how they played with
toys. She therefore equipped her consulting

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:09.900
room with small horses, figurines and locomotives
and established herself as a child psychoanalyst,

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.040
first in Berlin and then in London, where
she settled in 1926 and remained for the rest

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.900
of her life.
In her work with children, Klein wanted to

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:23.040
understand how human beings evolve from the
primitive pleasure-seeking impulses of early

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.710
infancy to the more mature adaptations of
later life – and in particular, she wanted

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.880
to know what might go wrong on this journey,
giving rise to the neurotic adaptations of

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.200
adults.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.960
In her 1932 book The Psychoanalysis of Children
she described the difficulty of the young

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.420
infant’s situation.

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.610
Weak, utterly at the mercy of adults, unable
to grasp what is happening, the infant cannot

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.570
– in Klein’s description – grasp that
people around it are in fact people, with

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.330
their own alternative reality and independent
points of view.

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:58.080
In the early weeks, the mother is not even
‘a mother’ to her child, she is – to

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:04.590
come to the crux of the issue – just a pair
of breasts which appear and disappear with

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.880
unpredictable and painful randomness.

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:12.870
In relation to this mother, all the infant
experiences are moments of intense pain and

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.950
then equally intense pleasure. When the breast
is there and the milk flows, a primordial

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.930
calm and satisfaction descends upon the infant:
it is suffused with feelings of well-being,

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:28.070
gratitude and tenderness (feelings that will,
in adulthood, be strongly associated with

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:33.490
being in love, a moment where breasts continue
to play a notable role for many). But when

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:39.180
the breast is for whatever reason it is missing,
the infant feels starving, enraged, terrified

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.230
and vengeful.

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.290
This, thought Klein, leads the infant to adopt
a primitive defence mechanism against what

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:51.960
would otherwise be intolerable anxiety. It
‘splits’ the mother into two very different

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.810
breasts: a ‘good breast’ and a ‘bad
breast’.

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.520
The bad breast is hated with a passion; the
infant wants to bite, wound and destroy this

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:04.750
object of unholy frustration. But the good
breast is revered with an equally thorough

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.200
though more benign intensity.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:12.050
With time, in healthy development, this ‘split’
heals. The child will gradually perceive that

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:17.700
there is in truth no entirely good and no
entirely bad breast, both belong to a mother

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.950
who is a perplexing mixture of the positive
and the negative: a source of pleasure and

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.520
frustration, joy and suffering.

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:29.569
The child discovers a key idea in Kleinian
psychoanalysis: the concept of

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:31.300
AMBIVALENCE

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:36.170
To be able to feel ambivalent about someone
is, for Kleinians, an enormous psychological

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:40.800
achievement and the first marker on the path
to genuine maturity.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:46.450
But it isn’t inevitable or assured. Only
slowly can a healthy child grasp the crucial

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:51.480
distinction between intention and effect,
between what a mother may have wanted for

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.640
it and what the child might have felt at her
hands nevertheless.

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:00.450
These complicated psychological reactions
belong a phase that Klein called

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.180
THE DEPRESSIVE POSITION

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:07.819
a moment of soberness and melancholy when
the growing child takes on board (unconsciously)

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:13.310
the idea that reality is more complicated
and less morally neat than it had ever previously

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:19.220
imagined: the mother (or other people generally)
cannot be neatly blamed for every setback;

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:24.090
almost nothing is totally pure or totally
evil, things are a perplexing, thought-provoking

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.430
mixture of the good and bad…

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:31.569
This is hard to take and – for Klein – explains
the serious faraway look that may sometime

00:04:31.569 --> 00:04:37.180
enter the eyes of children during daydreams.
These small beings look oddly wise and grave

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:42.099
at such moments; they are, somewhere deep
inside, cottoning on to the moral ambiguity

00:04:42.099 --> 00:04:44.289
of the real adult world.

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:49.319
Unfortunately, in Klein’s analysis, not
everyone makes it to the depressive position,

00:04:49.319 --> 00:04:53.740
 some get stuck in a mode of primitive
splitting she termed

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.699
THE PARANOID-SCHIZOID POSITION

00:04:56.699 --> 00:05:01.629
For many years, even into adulthood, these
unfortunate people will find themselves unable

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:07.569
to tolerate the slightest ambivalence: keen
to preserve their sense of their own innocence,

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:14.169
they must either hate or love. They must seek
scapegoats or idealise. In relationships,

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:18.199
they tend to fall violently in love and then
– at the inevitable moment when a lover

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:24.059
in some way disappoints them – switch abruptly
and become incapable of feeling anything anymore.

00:05:24.059 --> 00:05:28.569
These unfortunates are likely to move from
candidate to candidate, always seeking a vision

00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:35.569
of complete satisfaction, which is repeatedly
violated by an unwitting error on the lover’s

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:36.380
part.

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:42.319
We don’t have to believe in the literal
truth of Klein’s theory to see that it has

00:05:42.319 --> 00:05:48.919
value for us as an unusual but useful representation
of what it means to be a proper grown-up.

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:50.480
The impulse to reduce people

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:54.860
into what they can do for us (give us milk,
make us money, keep us happy), rather than

00:05:54.860 --> 00:06:01.860
what they are in and of themselves (a multifaceted
being), this can be painfully observed in emotional

00:06:01.879 --> 00:06:03.400
life generally.

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:08.969
With Melanie Klein’s help, we learn that coming
to terms with the ambivalent complex nature of all

00:06:08.969 --> 00:06:14.299
relationships belongs to the business of growing
up (a task we’re never quite done with)

00:06:14.299 --> 00:06:20.159
– and is likely to leave us a little sad,
if not for a time quite simply depressed.
