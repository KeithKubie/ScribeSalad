[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:11.385 --> 00:00:13.260
DAVID BODANIS: When I
was planning this book,

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:16.500
I thought if I wrote a book
titled something like "Why

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.180
Einstein is Smarter
Than Us And We're

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.809
a Bunch of Dumb
Schmucks," we're not

00:00:19.809 --> 00:00:21.600
very interested in
buying a book like that.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.910
But if there is a book
about poor Einstein

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.500
had these terrible
problems and we

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.390
can feel superior and console
him, that's really good.

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.090
You feel that's a
pretty good day.

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.330
I'm helping my poor
little friend Einstein.

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:33.590
Everyone's interested in him.

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.740
I'm assuming many most of us
here know some what he did.

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:39.480
Just a reminder, aside
from minor things,

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.470
put it this way-- the theory
of relativity, E equals MC

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:44.507
squared, was so
small there was just

00:00:44.507 --> 00:00:46.090
the beginning of
his-- he was so good,

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:47.920
he had two theories
of relativity.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.890
So one in 1995 when he was 26.

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.910
Those of you who are
approaching 26, feel anxious.

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.920
You have like a countdown
to getting there.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.590
If it's any consolation, you
can feel even more anxious

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:00.415
if you're younger.

00:01:00.415 --> 00:01:02.540
There was a fellow I studied
with at the University

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.920
of Chicago when I was young and
he was old, and at one point,

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.220
this fellow was on a boat
going from India to England,

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.761
and he said, oh,
it's been so many

00:01:11.761 --> 00:01:14.010
years that I've been striving,
and I'm such a failure.

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.460
I've accomplished nothing.

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:16.490
This is awful.

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:17.800
His name was Chandrasekhar.

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.880
The Chandra x-ray satellite
is named after him.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.540
And he was 19 years old.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.040
And in the midst
of his despair, he

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.373
came up with basically the
idea of black holes, which is

00:01:26.373 --> 00:01:27.841
pretty impressive in the 1930s.

00:01:27.841 --> 00:01:28.340
Anyway.

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.250
So Einstein at 25 did great
stuff-- special relativity.

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.030
At 35, he did greater
stuff-- General relativity.

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.824
If he hadn't done
special relativity,

00:01:37.824 --> 00:01:39.990
Poincare, Lorenz, lots of
people would have done it.

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.531
If he hadn't done
general relativity,

00:01:41.531 --> 00:01:43.120
we would still be
waiting for it.

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:44.620
Think about that in your field.

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:47.170
How many things, if a particular
organization disappears,

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:48.900
would not get done
by anybody else?

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.910
That's really rare
and really special.

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:51.760
He was very good.

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:55.430
He wasn't just good in
science, as you might imagine.

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.779
He was incredibly good
in practical technology.

00:01:57.779 --> 00:02:00.070
One of his great inventions
that he was really proud of

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.260
and spent a lot of time on in
the 1920s was the refrigerator.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:05.710
New, improved refrigerators.

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.790
Refrigerators in Berlin
leaked all the time.

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:09.520
And he didn't want
leaky refrigerators,

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.320
so he produced a wonderful
non-leaky Refrigerator.

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.360
There was a letter to
his great friend Max B

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.290
who also a Nobel
laureate and you wonder

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:18.630
what Nobel laureates discuss.

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.060
My refrigerator barely
leaks the new prototype

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.270
is even better than last time
next I'm down to 3.6% leak.

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:26.070
Yes.

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:27.490
Einstein was very excited.

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:30.412
In 1969, he needed to
take a break one weekend,

00:02:30.412 --> 00:02:32.620
and he was thinking-- not
about refrigerators and not

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.770
about general relativity--
and casually he

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:38.000
came up with the key idea
behind the laser, which

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.120
is pretty impressive.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.160
The first practical ones--
I think masers first,

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.990
microwaves-- were only
built 40 years later.

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:45.850
This organization would
not work very well

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:47.620
if there weren't
lasers zipping around

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.210
through fiber optics and stuff.

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:52.330
He also came up with the
photoelectric effect.

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.130
If you think about it, there is
light, which is kind of energy,

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.410
and there's electrons, which
are a certain substance.

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:58.750
And we take for granted
oh yeah, you know,

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.458
light heating metals
makes things happen.

00:03:00.458 --> 00:03:02.930
We use it in our phone
cameras all the time.

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:04.730
How does that possibly happen?

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.742
How does light, which is energy
How does it make stuff move?

00:03:09.742 --> 00:03:10.700
It's really impressive.

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.033
So he came up with that in 1905.

00:03:12.033 --> 00:03:13.860
That wasn't even
his greatest work.

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.120
Anyways he was terrific.

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.400
But then the secret--
his greatest mistake--

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.800
it turned out he made a mistake,
a psychological mistake,

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.150
and it was catastrophic.

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.750
Even though he was world
famous and his mind was still

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.050
good in his '40s
and stuff and people

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:30.090
exactly his age were
staying on with good work,

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:31.020
he became shunned.

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:33.120
He was a laughingstock
in the physics community.

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.110
When he was at
Princeton, he was at what

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.660
outsiders call the Princeton
Institute for Advanced Studies.

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.790
Insiders called it the
Princeton Institute

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.080
for Advanced Salaries.

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.430
They had a lot of money to bring
good refugee scientists over.

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.810
And for 30 years there,
people would say, oh,

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:47.960
don't go near him.

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.740
It's going to
destroy your career.

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:50.584
Don't go near him.

00:03:50.584 --> 00:03:51.250
He's a has been.

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:52.900
He's an archaic nothing.

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.070
And it really hurt his
feelings, because when

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:58.430
he was young and trendy-- before
the hair thing and stuff--

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:59.620
he was on top of the world.

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:00.770
Everybody came to him.

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:04.470
Einstein once said that people
think in two different ways.

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:05.252
A quiet quiz.

00:04:05.252 --> 00:04:06.460
You can see which one is you.

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:09.040
He said they're either
tennis players or golfers.

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.940
Tennis players, they just
need ideas back and forth.

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.920
You only clarify it when
you talk with other people.

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.199
Golfers are the ones who--
often the neighbors when they're

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:19.990
interviewed by the
police and he seems such

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:22.029
a quiet and nice young man.

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:25.090
The golfers are the ones who
need to sit quietly and think

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.000
and cogitate don't disturb me.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.720
They go to find a little
corner in a cafe and with that,

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.320
they come up with great ideas.

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:34.230
Well, it turns out Einstein
was actually a tennis player.

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:37.000
He wasn't a golfer
in that respect.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.894
And to be isolated
from other people,

00:04:38.894 --> 00:04:40.310
to have nobody
come to his office,

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:41.726
not have bright
grad students want

00:04:41.726 --> 00:04:43.740
to work with him,
that was awful.

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:44.480
Awful.

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.240
So it turns out,
how did this happen?

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:47.970
Why did this terrible
thing happen?

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:50.440
And there's a curious
parallel with high tech.

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.930
So I'll start
talking about how you

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:55.669
see this on a large scale--
like a large display--

00:04:55.669 --> 00:04:57.710
and then we'll zoom back
in and take a microscope

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:59.040
inside Einstein's brain.

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.130
So zoom out now a little bit.

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:04.207
And I want to talk about an
organization which many of you

00:05:04.207 --> 00:05:06.540
will have heard of, and some
of you may have studied at.

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:07.905
The Cavendish lab in Cambridge.

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:15.130
In the early 1900s,
the Cavendish Lab

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:17.312
was around the size of the
floor of this building.

00:05:17.312 --> 00:05:19.520
A little bit smaller than
the floor of this building.

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.780
It produced in a 20-year
period more Nobel prize winners

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:25.430
than all of France, all
of Japan, all of Italy

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:27.160
have ever done
combined, and those

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.730
are countries with terrific
educational backgrounds.

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:31.980
Think how could a place
about half the size

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:34.230
of this floor maybe
with some spill out labs

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:36.370
of the size of the floor
do something like that?

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:38.720
That's above and
beyond anything else.

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:39.940
And it wasn't just patronage.

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:42.231
It wasn't that they were
rigged on the Nobel Committee.

00:05:42.231 --> 00:05:46.370
This was stunning work, the
foundations of modern science.

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:48.570
And it turns out there were
several things they did.

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:49.980
One thing was kind of small.

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:52.090
At 6:00 PM, they turned
off the electricity.

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:54.006
You could sit there, but
you were in the dark.

00:05:54.006 --> 00:05:55.110
It meas you had to focus.

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:56.720
Sometimes if you have
to give a presentation,

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:57.707
it clears your head.

00:05:57.707 --> 00:05:59.790
If you have to give a
presentation with 20 minutes

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:00.995
prep, it's not so good.

00:06:00.995 --> 00:06:03.120
But if you have half a day
rather than three weeks,

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:04.661
you'll really focus
on that half day.

00:06:04.661 --> 00:06:06.750
6:00 PM electricity
was really good.

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:07.900
They also help with visas.

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:08.726
Very, very useful.

00:06:08.726 --> 00:06:10.100
But there are two
things that did

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:12.380
they were even better
at the Cavendish Lab.

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:13.800
And these later feedback.

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:16.040
You'll see them taking
place in Einstein's mind.

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:18.230
One is that they
made their own tools.

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:21.330
A long time ago, Air
France used to have

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:23.210
microphones in the
first class seats

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:26.311
from San Francisco to Paris.

00:06:26.311 --> 00:06:28.060
The French government
under Mr. Mitterand,

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:30.268
they would listen in on the
secrets of Silicon Valley

00:06:30.268 --> 00:06:30.900
and copy it.

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:32.430
Immediately, that's depressing.

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:34.120
Here's the other guys
who are terrific.

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:35.910
Let's see if we can
catch up with them.

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:38.250
Much better is to make your
own tools and be first.

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:39.425
Se who catches up with you.

00:06:39.425 --> 00:06:41.550
There was a young guy
working at this Cavendish lab

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:42.160
from Germany.

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:42.890
A grad student.

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:45.600
He thought, we need a
better way to detect

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:46.860
little bits of radiation.

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:48.430
His name was Hans Geiger.

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:51.960
Thus the Geiger counter
named in his honor.

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:53.380
They had lots of
tools like that.

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:55.070
It was this
wonderful confidence.

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:55.950
That was good.

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:57.640
So 6:00 PM stops was good.

00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:58.890
Making our own tools was good.

00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:00.360
But the best of
all is the guy who

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:03.550
ran it was in New Zealand
farmer named rather Rutherford,

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:07.370
and he had a concept of what I
call a mid-level abstraction.

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:09.960
If you tell somebody
coming to a research lab,

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:12.050
let's be the best, it
doesn't really help you.

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:13.425
I mean, it applies
to Nike shoes.

00:07:13.425 --> 00:07:14.841
It doesn't give
you anything help.

00:07:14.841 --> 00:07:17.300
If you say to somebody coming
to a great research lab,

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:19.140
give him some very
detailed thing--

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:21.384
Phillips needs help
calibrating this microscope,

00:07:21.384 --> 00:07:23.550
and we're doing an interesting
piece of work there--

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:24.180
that's fine.

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:25.290
It's great to help
Phillips, and you

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:26.710
can be really good
at microscopes,

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:27.850
but that's one thing.

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:29.420
It's too detailed.

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:31.140
What Rutherford did
at the Cavendish Lab

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:34.800
in the 1910s and 1920s
come up with what

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:36.540
is a mid-level abstraction.

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:39.117
He had one guiding principle,
which wasn't too abstract

00:07:39.117 --> 00:07:40.200
and wasn't too particular.

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:41.976
He said, everybody
who to the lab--

00:07:41.976 --> 00:07:43.100
you know we're going to do?

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:45.530
We're going to find out
what's inside the atom.

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:47.710
Nothing more, nothing less.

00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:49.240
It's a perfect idea.

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:51.290
With that, everybody
understands what's going on,

00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:53.790
everybody can share, but you're
not telling them what to do.

00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:55.290
You give them a
real lot of freedom,

00:07:55.290 --> 00:07:56.980
but they're still
pulling together.

00:07:56.980 --> 00:07:59.170
Saint Exupery, the
French poet, once said,

00:07:59.170 --> 00:08:00.920
love isn't looking
into each other's eyes.

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:02.862
It's looking together
in the same direction.

00:08:02.862 --> 00:08:04.820
If you've ever been in
a poisonous organization

00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:06.780
where people are pulling
in different directions.

00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:08.510
You don't quite understand
what's going on.

00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:09.440
You don't people
don't understand

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:10.640
why they should
work with each other

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:12.110
you'll know how
important that was.

00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:14.240
Mid-level abstraction
was wonderful.

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:14.960
Second question.

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:17.599
So that's how you create
a great organization.

00:08:17.599 --> 00:08:19.640
In this case, the greatest
research lab the world

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:20.399
has ever seen.

00:08:20.399 --> 00:08:22.190
Second question, how
do they stay that way?

00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:23.760
And the answer is
they usually don't.

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:26.210
They almost always fade
within about 20 years.

00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:29.280
The Cavendish lab under
Rutherford was magnificent,

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:32.679
then after about the
mid-1920s, it faded away.

00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:34.330
That approach didn't work.

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:35.855
The outside world was changing.

00:08:35.855 --> 00:08:37.730
How to find what's inside
the atom with tools

00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:40.100
you can make yourself in
Cambridge-- it stopped.

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:42.700
It was really upsetting.

00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:44.380
So now occasionally,
companies can

00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:46.690
keep on doing the same
thing for a real long time.

00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:48.660
I worked for a while
with Shell Scenarios.

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:50.970
Shell has a very
simple principle.

00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:52.620
It's not abstractly the best.

00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:54.341
It's not incredibly
detailed do this one

00:08:54.341 --> 00:08:55.340
arrangement with a rock.

00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:58.400
It's extract oil using
really good engineers

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:01.860
and make clever political
arrangements with the companies

00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:02.980
that supply it.

00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:04.470
It's worked well for 120 years.

00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:05.610
So that's fine.

00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:07.630
That's a simple,
unchanging field.

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:11.420
If they can get into clean
energy well, I'd be surprised.

00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:13.260
Pleasantly surprised,
but surprised.

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:14.620
So that's their abstraction.

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:16.020
Usually that doesn't work.

00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:18.730
So Einstein's life, if
we go back to him now,

00:09:18.730 --> 00:09:21.160
he sort of solves the problem
about how you can do better

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:23.930
than these companies, and he
also reveals a possible answer.

00:09:23.930 --> 00:09:26.429
So like I said, it's going to
give a little microscope going

00:09:26.429 --> 00:09:28.830
inside his brain.

00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:30.864
So I'll talk a bit
about his creativity.

00:09:30.864 --> 00:09:33.280
And his creativity was very
much like those big companies.

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:36.940
So one thing they did was the
thing pulling the plug at PM

00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:37.960
from the electricity.

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:40.460
Einstein didn't have a
limitation with electricity.

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:43.280
They often say you
can do mathematics

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:46.330
and theoretical physics
with just the pencil, paper,

00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:48.232
and a dust bin.

00:09:48.232 --> 00:09:50.309
A waste basket.

00:09:50.309 --> 00:09:51.850
Cynics will say you
can do philosophy

00:09:51.850 --> 00:09:53.790
in exactly the same
way, but you don't need

00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:55.710
the dustbin, which is kind of

00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:56.360
Cruel.

00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:58.820
Einstein himself loved
good philosophers.

00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:01.830
Kant, at one point, had an image
of space-time diagrams, which

00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:03.760
is really good in the 1770s.

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:06.190
Hume's notions about
causality and just looking

00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:08.400
at what you observe where
than trying to understand

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:09.370
what's going on inside.

00:10:09.370 --> 00:10:11.090
These are great
powerful notions.

00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:13.450
So Einstein, the
equivalent of the 6:00 PM

00:10:13.450 --> 00:10:17.430
stop-- he had terrible
problems in relationships.

00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:20.070
After his best friend died
when they were both old men,

00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:22.420
Einstein wrote the best
friend's family, Michele Besso

00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:24.152
and said, I admired
your dad for me

00:10:24.152 --> 00:10:25.860
a nice guy and a
sounding board, but what

00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:28.940
I admired best was that he made
a relationship with one woman

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:32.040
work for his entire life,
something which I, sadly,

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:33.350
have failed in twice.

00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:35.620
So Einstein had
spent a lot of time

00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:38.160
moving from apartment to
apartment, flats to flat,

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:39.940
escaping from one
person, having an affair

00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:41.970
with the wrong person,
going off to another one.

00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:44.010
It really restricted his time.

00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:46.059
Sometimes he was
writing in trains

00:10:46.059 --> 00:10:47.600
because he couldn't
stay in any city.

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:50.500
So he had constraints
on his time.

00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:52.960
For his tools, developing
your own tools,

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:55.280
he developed what's
now kind of standard.

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:57.440
He really developed tensors.

00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:00.360
Those of you who aren't with a
technical background, scalars

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:02.800
are numbers and
stuff, and vectors

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:05.430
are a number with a
direction like an arrow,

00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:08.630
and tensors just generalize
that a little bit more.

00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:10.847
It's in the appendix
to the book.

00:11:10.847 --> 00:11:12.430
So he developed that,
and he specially

00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:14.300
developed interesting
ways of understanding

00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:15.250
surfaces and stuff.

00:11:15.250 --> 00:11:18.500
It was his own fresh tools,
which meant nobody else had it.

00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:21.000
Imagine if you have a tool
which nobody else has.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.510
There was an athlete
40, 50 years ago

00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:24.830
who was a mid-level jumper.

00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:29.130
He wasn't incredible, but he had
found a way-- I think was Dick.

00:11:29.130 --> 00:11:31.637
Fosbury was his last name--
of jumping backwards.

00:11:31.637 --> 00:11:33.720
This is the famous way
that high jumpers jump now.

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:35.580
When he had that
tool nobody else did,

00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:37.890
he was great, even though he
wasn't a stunning athlete.

00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:39.890
Once everybody else had
it, he had to fade away.

00:11:39.890 --> 00:11:40.890
He wasn't that good.

00:11:40.890 --> 00:11:42.137
Advantages to being first.

00:11:42.137 --> 00:11:43.970
And then the other great
thing that Einstein

00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:45.752
was good at his
mid-level abstraction.

00:11:45.752 --> 00:11:46.710
That's a bit technical.

00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:48.040
I get into it in the book.

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:51.560
It was a way how you
can view any physics

00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:54.360
problem independent of
whoever's watching, whether I'm

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:58.380
jumping up and down, whether
I'm moving quickly or slowly.

00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:00.440
How would things
seem if everybody

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:02.970
is able to view things,
and you can't tell

00:12:02.970 --> 00:12:05.170
who has a special position.

00:12:05.170 --> 00:12:07.080
It's kind of very
much a democracy.

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:09.130
I know it's kind of waffly
to say it like that,

00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:11.010
so I have to go and leave
the details in the book.

00:12:11.010 --> 00:12:13.265
But he had his unique tools,
he had pressures on time,

00:12:13.265 --> 00:12:15.929
and he had a beautiful
mid-level abstraction.

00:12:15.929 --> 00:12:18.220
He wasn't trying to solve a
particular physical problem

00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:20.660
down here, nor was he saying
I'm going to be the best.

00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:21.620
I'm going to achieve.

00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:23.490
I'm going to create greatness.

00:12:23.490 --> 00:12:27.054
And his abstractions were
very, very, very good.

00:12:27.054 --> 00:12:28.470
Anyways, it turns
out at one point

00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:30.120
he drew the mechanism
of how creativity

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:32.050
happens inside his own brain.

00:12:32.050 --> 00:12:34.290
And those of you who read
German as well as I do,

00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:37.330
which is not too well, will
not be following the German.

00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:39.940
What I'm going to do
while this slide's up,

00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:43.850
I'm going to draw something
like that roughly on the board.

00:12:43.850 --> 00:12:46.980
So what Einstein said is down
here, things in the real world

00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:48.470
events and stuff
that you look at,

00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:50.450
and then we make
a creative jump,

00:12:50.450 --> 00:12:53.280
a creative leap of the
imagination going up here.

00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:55.920
And from this vantage
point, we see fresh things.

00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:56.820
We're up here.

00:12:56.820 --> 00:12:58.560
Remember, and this
is a mid-level thing.

00:12:58.560 --> 00:12:59.607
It's not incredibly high.

00:12:59.607 --> 00:13:01.690
It isn't I'm going to
survey the world like a god,

00:13:01.690 --> 00:13:03.560
but it's not a detail
thing down here.

00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:06.570
And from here, you
draw conclusions.

00:13:06.570 --> 00:13:08.740
And if the
conclusions are right,

00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:10.280
they match what's down there.

00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:12.690
And then this jump up
has been correct, right?

00:13:12.690 --> 00:13:14.315
Very simple form.

00:13:14.315 --> 00:13:16.100
That was the sort of form.

00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:18.560
And that's what he
said, how it works.

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:20.420
And from that perch,
you can see everything.

00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:22.750
Anyways, it's a great idea,
and Einstein followed it

00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:24.620
successfully for
quite a few years.

00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:28.220
But then after about 20 years--
this happened so often--

00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:30.160
he stopped following it.

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:32.620
I have time to tell you a little
bit of the story about how

00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:33.620
he stopped following it.

00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:36.100
The book is mostly about that.

00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:41.040
It turns out in 1915, 1916,
100 years ago in the middle

00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:44.030
of wartime Berlin he came
up with an equation that

00:13:44.030 --> 00:13:47.922
describes the entire
shape of the universe.

00:13:47.922 --> 00:13:49.630
As a rough example--
and again, apologies

00:13:49.630 --> 00:13:52.200
to people who've done physics
at a high level-- as a very

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:54.300
rough image, imagine
that space is

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:56.720
like a flat trampoline
or a rubber sheet,

00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:59.520
and if I take a little
ball bearing and flick it,

00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:00.830
it will go in a straight line.

00:14:00.830 --> 00:14:01.960
And if I flick in
some other way,

00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:02.970
it will go in a straight line.

00:14:02.970 --> 00:14:04.553
Those might be
something like planets.

00:14:04.553 --> 00:14:05.650
You just flick him along.

00:14:05.650 --> 00:14:08.000
You see the big
finger coming down

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.390
from south of King's Cross.

00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:10.360
OK.

00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:14.010
If you take a rock or a heavier
ball and put it in the middle

00:14:14.010 --> 00:14:15.950
that sheet, it'll sag
down in that sheet.

00:14:15.950 --> 00:14:18.150
And think of that as
the sun or something.

00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:20.672
Then if I flick a ball
bearing, the ball bearing,

00:14:20.672 --> 00:14:22.130
instead of going
straight-- it will

00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:24.330
if it's far away-- if the
sheet's sagging down here,

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:26.520
the ball bearing
will veer around it

00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:28.357
like in a billiards or
pool table and stuff.

00:14:28.357 --> 00:14:29.190
Kind of makes sense.

00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:30.550
Again, it's only a metaphor.

00:14:30.550 --> 00:14:31.720
Here it's curving in space.

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:34.350
In fact, in reality it's
curving in space-time

00:14:34.350 --> 00:14:35.780
it's a wonderful notion.

00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:39.420
Force then becomes just
a distortion of space.

00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:41.050
Geometry leads you along.

00:14:41.050 --> 00:14:43.859
An example there is two people
walking to the North Pole.

00:14:43.859 --> 00:14:45.900
You can start in different
points on the equator,

00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:47.760
and you look at each other--
you're a few yards apart--

00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:49.210
and you say, we're
going to stay parallel.

00:14:49.210 --> 00:14:50.584
We're each going
to go due north.

00:14:50.584 --> 00:14:52.860
But you realize that geometry
will force you together.

00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:54.860
You'll see this person
coming closer and closer.

00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:56.300
You'll say, you're
not going straight.

00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:57.341
He'll say, the heck I am.

00:14:57.341 --> 00:14:58.660
I'm going perfectly straight.

00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:02.050
So what appears to be a force
come from the distortions

00:15:02.050 --> 00:15:02.614
of geometry.

00:15:02.614 --> 00:15:05.280
That's a two-dimensional surface
in our three-dimensional space.

00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:09.410
Space-time is four-dimensional
so that's how it works.

00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:11.760
Anyways, the details
are in the book.

00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:12.760
That isn't what matters.

00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:14.134
What matters is
Einstein came out

00:15:14.134 --> 00:15:18.210
of it with a beautiful
equation g equals t.

00:15:18.210 --> 00:15:21.260
Geometry creates
how things move,

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:23.850
and the structure
and shape of things,

00:15:23.850 --> 00:15:26.500
which includes mass and
energy, will shape the geometry

00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:27.170
around it.

00:15:27.170 --> 00:15:29.410
The fact of a heavy
bowling ball will

00:15:29.410 --> 00:15:31.570
sag the sheet of
space-time around it,

00:15:31.570 --> 00:15:34.287
and the curvature of space-time
will show that there's

00:15:34.287 --> 00:15:35.370
got to be something there.

00:15:35.370 --> 00:15:36.870
You know, something
there behind it.

00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:38.004
What a beautiful idea.

00:15:38.004 --> 00:15:40.420
Among other things Einstein
worked out shortly afterwards,

00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:43.300
in 1917, was that this
predicted that the universe was

00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:44.170
expanding.

00:15:44.170 --> 00:15:45.850
What an amazing idea.

00:15:45.850 --> 00:15:47.970
And he went to his astronomer
of friends and said,

00:15:47.970 --> 00:15:49.450
I've predicted the
universe is expanding.

00:15:49.450 --> 00:15:50.950
These two simple
equations that seem

00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:52.750
to reveal the truth
of the universe

00:15:52.750 --> 00:15:54.470
explain the universe
is expanding.

00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:58.154
And his astronomer friends,
in 1917, said, big mistake.

00:15:58.154 --> 00:15:59.320
The data shows the opposite.

00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:00.610
The universe is static.

00:16:00.610 --> 00:16:03.490
The Milky Way galaxy is just
sitting here, kind of floating,

00:16:03.490 --> 00:16:06.390
and beyond it is a void,
sort of like looking

00:16:06.390 --> 00:16:07.620
to Donald Trump's mind.

00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:10.960
There's just nothing there,
maybe some malicious entities

00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:13.200
and a little bit of
sneering coming back at us.

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:14.750
That's it.

00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:16.700
So Einstein had to
put in a modification

00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:18.945
to his equation, the
famous lambda term.

00:16:18.945 --> 00:16:20.570
And instead of this
beautiful symmetry,

00:16:20.570 --> 00:16:22.819
where he thought not so much
that he detected the hand

00:16:22.819 --> 00:16:25.560
of God-- he wasn't an atheist.

00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:27.520
He wasn't a formal
religious believer.

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:28.560
He was anti-atheist.

00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:29.620
He said, how could
you be so sure?

00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:31.630
He was sort of in-between,
kind of like Spinoza,

00:16:31.630 --> 00:16:33.160
if you interested in pantheism.

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:34.464
It's quite extraordinary.

00:16:34.464 --> 00:16:35.880
There are subtle
structures there.

00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:37.740
He didn't know why or
what they came from.

00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:41.100
He once gave an image of humans
as being like a little boy

00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:43.070
in a big library in the dark.

00:16:43.070 --> 00:16:44.310
It's at night.

00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:45.740
It's maybe foggy out.

00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:48.080
And the walls of
the library, there's

00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:49.750
all these bookshelves
around with books.

00:16:49.750 --> 00:16:52.150
And in those books, are the
secrets of the universe.

00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:53.010
They actually exist.

00:16:53.010 --> 00:16:54.950
They've been specified
really clearly.

00:16:54.950 --> 00:16:57.630
Very occasionally, the
brightest members of our species

00:16:57.630 --> 00:17:00.320
can walk forward, go up to
one of the books, open it,

00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:01.600
and you'll actually see it.

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:03.670
One line might say,
equals MC squared.

00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:04.430
Wow.

00:17:04.430 --> 00:17:08.442
Another might have the
tensor behind G equals T.

00:17:08.442 --> 00:17:10.900
But then we usually have to
close it, go back, and retreat.

00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:12.329
But we know it's there waiting.

00:17:12.329 --> 00:17:13.790
Einstein loved that.

00:17:13.790 --> 00:17:15.160
Newton had seen some things.

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:17.380
Einstein was lucky enough
to see some things.

00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:18.810
Future generations could also.

00:17:18.810 --> 00:17:20.660
It's a wonderful platonic dream.

00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:23.510
Anyway, he felt bad that he had
to modify that simple G equals

00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:27.000
T, but he said, OK, if the data
doesn't show that it's correct,

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.010
I'll have to modify.

00:17:28.010 --> 00:17:29.970
So he made his equation
ugly for 10 years.

00:17:29.970 --> 00:17:32.880
10 years later, Hubble in
California and other people

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:35.270
said, oy, did we get it wrong.

00:17:35.270 --> 00:17:36.410
Oy, did we get it wrong.

00:17:36.410 --> 00:17:39.294
I'm adding the "oy" they
probably didn't say "oy."

00:17:39.294 --> 00:17:40.960
And they said the
universe is expanding.

00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:43.832
They found this wonderful
evidence that it's expanding

00:17:43.832 --> 00:17:45.790
and each part is expanding
from the other parts

00:17:45.790 --> 00:17:47.180
at a terrific rate.

00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:48.840
And Einstein was
so happy at that.

00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:49.926
He said "I knew it.

00:17:49.926 --> 00:17:50.800
I knew it all along."

00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:54.400
Have any of you, here seen
"Galaxy Quest," the film?

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:56.450
Remember there's
this teenage boy

00:17:56.450 --> 00:17:58.030
on Earth, who
believes that aliens

00:17:58.030 --> 00:17:59.330
are speaking to him and stuff.

00:17:59.330 --> 00:18:00.580
And nobody believes
him and stuff.

00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:01.000
He says, oh, yeah.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:01.310
I know.

00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:02.060
It's just made up.

00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:03.779
And then he actually sees them.

00:18:03.779 --> 00:18:04.320
That's right.

00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:05.111
He said, I knew it.

00:18:05.111 --> 00:18:05.850
I knew all along.

00:18:05.850 --> 00:18:06.724
It was actually true.

00:18:06.724 --> 00:18:08.390
So that was Einstein
after 10 years.

00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:12.130
He realized he should have
stuck to his original thing.

00:18:12.130 --> 00:18:14.750
The experimental
evidence was agreed

00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:17.790
on by all the astronomers in
the world, but they were wrong.

00:18:17.790 --> 00:18:20.407
If he had just held
his nerve a bit longer,

00:18:20.407 --> 00:18:21.740
he would have been proven right.

00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:22.860
How cool is that?

00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:23.990
Two simple forms.

00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:26.030
Two simple tensors,
G equals T. Again,

00:18:26.030 --> 00:18:28.060
I'm summarizing,
but basically, that.

00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:30.600
That somebody came up with
in their head in Berlin

00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:35.220
during World War I, predicted
that our local cluster

00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:37.860
is expanding away from
other parts of the galaxy.

00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:40.190
How utterly extraordinary
that advanced

00:18:40.190 --> 00:18:42.250
primates can do
something like that.

00:18:42.250 --> 00:18:43.360
It was wonderful.

00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:49.309
So what Einstein did
here-- so he came up here.

00:18:49.309 --> 00:18:50.850
So one of his
principles, there would

00:18:50.850 --> 00:18:53.650
be say G equals T, and
the things he found there,

00:18:53.650 --> 00:18:56.620
it showed that the
universe was expanding.

00:18:56.620 --> 00:18:57.830
So I'll do like that.

00:18:57.830 --> 00:18:59.370
It shows the universe
was expanding.

00:18:59.370 --> 00:19:04.907
It also explained
how Mercury wobbled

00:19:04.907 --> 00:19:05.990
as it went around the Sun.

00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:08.090
Mercury's orbit wasn't
quite what you would think.

00:19:08.090 --> 00:19:12.135
The curve down there by the Sun,
the decay of that trampoline

00:19:12.135 --> 00:19:15.790
or rubber sheet was greater than
Newton would have predicted.

00:19:15.790 --> 00:19:17.760
Mercury I believe is that.

00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:18.760
So that was under there.

00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:20.260
And he had all sorts
of predictions,

00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:23.190
and they really held up.

00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:25.260
And that was the
simple G equals T.

00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:26.430
Anyway, so all that's good.

00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:28.290
You think, OK, that's
a technical mistake.

00:19:28.290 --> 00:19:28.890
He gave in.

00:19:28.890 --> 00:19:29.740
He shouldn't have given in.

00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:31.615
It's sort of like they
often say in business,

00:19:31.615 --> 00:19:34.390
a reinforced victory,
a starved defeat.

00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:35.812
But of course, when is victory?

00:19:35.812 --> 00:19:38.270
You release a new product that's
not doing that well, maybe

00:19:38.270 --> 00:19:39.844
market penetration is likely.

00:19:39.844 --> 00:19:41.760
Give it a little bit
longer, it's really good.

00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:43.660
A bit more ads, a bit
more improvements,

00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:44.760
and tweaks, we have it.

00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:48.010
At what point do you stop?

00:19:48.010 --> 00:19:49.880
Einstein thought that
he'd stopped too soon.

00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:52.920
Anyways, from this, he drew
a catastrophic conclusion.

00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:56.290
He decided that whenever
you had to listen

00:19:56.290 --> 00:19:58.240
to experimental
evidence, if you believe

00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:00.940
that something clear and
simple had been found.

00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:01.470
Right?

00:20:01.470 --> 00:20:05.380
That those instructions that the
divinity or the divine forces,

00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:07.390
or just the facts of
the universe had made,

00:20:07.390 --> 00:20:09.890
he was kind of ambiguous on it.

00:20:09.890 --> 00:20:11.970
That would have
to be super clear.

00:20:11.970 --> 00:20:14.300
Those things you found in
the books in the library,

00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:16.830
they had to be
really, really simple.

00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:19.260
Quantum mechanics started
coming in around this time.

00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:22.130
And Einstein had helped create
quantum mechanics in 1905,

00:20:22.130 --> 00:20:24.740
but in the late 1920s, it
was getting even better.

00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:26.830
The famous Heisenberg's
uncertainty principle,

00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:27.900
things like that.

00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:30.108
Einstein thought, well, this
is all very interesting.

00:20:30.108 --> 00:20:32.900
The mathematics is
really good, and it's

00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:34.650
a temporary epiphenomena.

00:20:34.650 --> 00:20:36.890
Our equipment can't tell
exactly what's going on,

00:20:36.890 --> 00:20:38.640
and of course, probability
is very useful.

00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:42.650
His early work on the lasers
was exactly what probabilities

00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:44.250
of electron transitions.

00:20:44.250 --> 00:20:45.520
He said, that's fine.

00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:47.690
Heisenberg at one point
was so excited by Einstein,

00:20:47.690 --> 00:20:49.190
he went up, he
visited him in Berlin

00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:52.860
and said, Professor
Einstein, I loved

00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:54.874
the way you just used
observational evidence

00:20:54.874 --> 00:20:57.290
without trying to wonder what
was happening backstage when

00:20:57.290 --> 00:20:58.560
you came up with relativity.

00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:00.185
That's what I did in
quantum mechanics.

00:21:00.185 --> 00:21:00.780
Thank you.

00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:02.334
Einstein looked at him.

00:21:02.334 --> 00:21:04.000
That's not what I
meant at all, he said.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:05.646
I didn't mean
anything like that.

00:21:05.646 --> 00:21:07.270
He thought that it
was just provisional

00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:10.010
if you didn't know the
details, eventually the details

00:21:10.010 --> 00:21:11.590
would be clear and exact.

00:21:11.590 --> 00:21:13.960
So Einstein couldn't
accept quantum mechanics.

00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:15.490
And as evidence
came in, and there

00:21:15.490 --> 00:21:20.010
became more and more evidence,
he wouldn't accept it.

00:21:20.010 --> 00:21:24.110
Now, it turns out,
he couldn't do it.

00:21:24.110 --> 00:21:25.930
So he was stuck up here.

00:21:25.930 --> 00:21:27.860
This had worked
really, really well.

00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:28.610
Applying for this.

00:21:28.610 --> 00:21:29.670
Applying for that.

00:21:29.670 --> 00:21:30.980
Why should you ever change it?

00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:31.890
This is wonderful.

00:21:31.890 --> 00:21:34.040
There is something here
that it didn't apply to.

00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:35.300
Well, that was a temporary.

00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:36.540
Remember, he had
been burned once

00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:37.915
with the expense
of the universe.

00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:42.230
Again, imagine you're
pushing a product,

00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:43.770
and you pull back
on it too soon.

00:21:43.770 --> 00:21:46.074
A competitor does it,
and it works perfectly.

00:21:46.074 --> 00:21:46.740
Well, I knew it.

00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:47.840
I should have just waited.

00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:50.690
I have to ignore everybody's
comments against it and stuff.

00:21:50.690 --> 00:21:52.500
There's times to really
stick to your guns.

00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:53.310
Same thing in math.

00:21:53.310 --> 00:21:54.090
Same thing in physics.

00:21:54.090 --> 00:21:55.420
You're working on
a certain approach,

00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:57.230
you don't get the right
answer, right away.

00:21:57.230 --> 00:21:57.650
Oh, I'm nervous.

00:21:57.650 --> 00:21:58.310
I have to jump back.

00:21:58.310 --> 00:21:59.490
No, sometimes you have to stick.

00:21:59.490 --> 00:22:00.670
The question is, how long.

00:22:00.670 --> 00:22:02.207
How long?

00:22:02.207 --> 00:22:03.790
Some people think
that, well, Einstein

00:22:03.790 --> 00:22:06.150
faded in his 40's,
because in your 40s

00:22:06.150 --> 00:22:10.590
your brain isn't as nimble
as it was at other times.

00:22:10.590 --> 00:22:13.200
Those of you who are
anxious about not being

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:17.880
up to the Chandra level
at 19 or Einstein at 26,

00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:21.160
remember, if you're really
quick at mental arithmetic,

00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:23.260
that tends to peak
just before age 11.

00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:25.010
And if you're good at
picking up languages

00:22:25.010 --> 00:22:27.270
to get a perfect
accent, it is almost

00:22:27.270 --> 00:22:29.300
impossible after the
late teens or early '20s.

00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:30.810
Something changes in the brain.

00:22:30.810 --> 00:22:32.726
You can become fluent,
very fluent in language

00:22:32.726 --> 00:22:35.030
but the perfect accent
just gets harder.

00:22:35.030 --> 00:22:36.880
So the question is,
is physics like that?

00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:38.892
And the answer,
curiously, is no.

00:22:38.892 --> 00:22:41.100
Chandrasekhar, that person
that I mentioned, one day,

00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:43.302
and I think in the
early 1980s, his wife

00:22:43.302 --> 00:22:44.760
elbowed him in the
ribs in Chicago.

00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:46.251
She told me this later.

00:22:46.251 --> 00:22:47.750
And she said
Chandrasekhar, wake up.

00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:48.540
It's the Swedish Academy.

00:22:48.540 --> 00:22:49.590
You have the Nobel Prize.

00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:51.910
And he said, without
any arrogance,

00:22:51.910 --> 00:22:53.800
he said, oh, for
which discovery?

00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:57.150
He had about six or seven
that were worthy of the Nobel.

00:22:57.150 --> 00:23:02.050
So he was doing great work
into his 60s, even into a 70s.

00:23:02.050 --> 00:23:03.640
[? Raleigh ?] in
the 1800's did that.

00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:04.890
So there's a number
of people who do that.

00:23:04.890 --> 00:23:07.180
And in particular, Einstein's
best friend for a while

00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:08.520
was Niels Bohr.

00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:14.100
And Neils Bohr, the
great Danish Physicist

00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:16.060
who apparently had
won a language which

00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:17.276
was called bad English.

00:23:17.276 --> 00:23:19.150
He could speak bad
English with every accent.

00:23:19.150 --> 00:23:20.480
He could speak it
with a Danish accent.

00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:21.980
He could speak with
a French accent.

00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:24.490
Wherever he went, people
found that "I can't quite

00:23:24.490 --> 00:23:25.240
get what you say."

00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:25.739
Like that.

00:23:25.739 --> 00:23:26.420
He would mumble.

00:23:26.420 --> 00:23:27.760
He was a wonderful man.

00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:31.057
And in his 60s, even in the 70s,
at his institute in Copenhagen,

00:23:31.057 --> 00:23:33.140
bright, young, grad students
from around the world

00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:34.910
wanted to work with him.

00:23:34.910 --> 00:23:39.300
Einstein is famous for
saying "God does not

00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:40.640
play dice with the universe."

00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:43.550
Niels Bohr said to him,
once Niels Bohr had accepted

00:23:43.550 --> 00:23:45.120
the evidence from
quantum mechanics,

00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:47.300
once Niels Bohr had looked
down at these new things,

00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:50.450
these quantum results, Niels
Bohr said to him, Einstein,

00:23:50.450 --> 00:23:52.360
stop telling God what to do.

00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:53.560
Looking at the universe.

00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:54.430
Stop telling him.

00:23:54.430 --> 00:23:56.590
So Niels Bohr had
actually moved over here.

00:23:56.590 --> 00:23:58.550
This is G equals T, but
more importantly, it's

00:23:58.550 --> 00:24:00.600
the notion that everything
should be exact.

00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:01.730
I'll call that a
little right angle.

00:24:01.730 --> 00:24:02.855
Everything should be exact.

00:24:02.855 --> 00:24:05.420
Nils Bohr went over here and
he had a slightly different

00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:07.564
abstract principle, which
accepted the principles

00:24:07.564 --> 00:24:08.605
behind quantum mechanics.

00:24:08.605 --> 00:24:11.740
That there's going to be a
certain fundamental probability

00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:14.630
and as far as you go down in
the universe it isn't exact.

00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:16.630
There's going to be
probability and uncertainty.

00:24:16.630 --> 00:24:17.960
It isn't terrible.

00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:19.280
Things are cusped and limited.

00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:21.404
So things as they come to
the macro level are fine.

00:24:21.404 --> 00:24:23.380
We can make transistors
work very, very well.

00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:25.290
But within transistors,
these quantum effects

00:24:25.290 --> 00:24:26.460
are taking place.

00:24:26.460 --> 00:24:27.830
That's what happens.

00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:30.880
So Niels Bohr had actually
managed to move over here.

00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:32.670
And from here, he
comes very close.

00:24:32.670 --> 00:24:35.380
So imagine this is something
that doesn't apply there,

00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:37.640
but Niels Bohr thinks it
applies very, very well.

00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:39.870
So he was able to move there.

00:24:39.870 --> 00:24:41.167
Einstein couldn't.

00:24:41.167 --> 00:24:42.750
The Cavendish lab,
remember I told you

00:24:42.750 --> 00:24:44.320
the Cavendish Lab fell apart.

00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:46.609
For 20 years, find out
what's inside the atom.

00:24:46.609 --> 00:24:47.900
What's a perfect guiding light?

00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:49.840
It's the sort of
thing if you've ever

00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:52.567
been watching a video at home,
and somebody comes in and says,

00:24:52.567 --> 00:24:53.400
oh, what's going on?

00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:55.445
You give them a little
or you whisper something.

00:24:55.445 --> 00:24:58.170
Or if it's "24" you're
saying, Jack Bauer

00:24:58.170 --> 00:25:00.612
is almost about to get the
person and the rugs going

00:25:00.612 --> 00:25:02.320
to be pulled out from
under him and he'll

00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:03.945
have to get the person
a different way.

00:25:03.945 --> 00:25:06.010
That can apply to any
"24" episode ever.

00:25:06.010 --> 00:25:07.760
But often, you go into
a movie, and people

00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:09.610
will whisper what's going on.

00:25:09.610 --> 00:25:11.950
The great thing about these
mid-level abstractions

00:25:11.950 --> 00:25:14.540
is you can whisper
to somebody and they

00:25:14.540 --> 00:25:16.030
get all the knowledge
of the people

00:25:16.030 --> 00:25:17.363
have already done the hard work.

00:25:17.363 --> 00:25:18.579
How cool is that?

00:25:18.579 --> 00:25:20.370
I can whisper to you
the rules of calculus.

00:25:20.370 --> 00:25:21.494
You're smarter than Newton.

00:25:21.494 --> 00:25:23.710
I can whisper, even in
a simple book like this,

00:25:23.710 --> 00:25:25.240
a bit of general
relativity, you're

00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:28.020
passed what Albert Einstein,
himself, did in his 30s.

00:25:28.020 --> 00:25:29.205
It's really awesome.

00:25:29.205 --> 00:25:30.580
The Cavendish lab,
they whispered

00:25:30.580 --> 00:25:32.500
to people who were
really bright in physics,

00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:33.916
let's look what's
inside the atom.

00:25:33.916 --> 00:25:36.730
And immediately they have
a good research proposal.

00:25:36.730 --> 00:25:39.390
Yes, so that's what they did,
but that faded after a while.

00:25:39.390 --> 00:25:41.780
And then about 15 years
later, somebody else

00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:43.480
took over the
Cavendish and said,

00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:46.950
you know what would be a really
good mid-level abstraction?

00:25:46.950 --> 00:25:49.519
Let's use x-rays
to study crystals.

00:25:49.519 --> 00:25:50.810
How about crystals or proteins?

00:25:50.810 --> 00:25:54.010
Yeah, let's use x-rays to
study protein crystals.

00:25:54.010 --> 00:25:55.100
That was fabulous.

00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:56.704
That's how DNA was
discovered, right?

00:25:56.704 --> 00:25:59.120
It crystallized this beautifully
in the x-ray diffraction.

00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:01.620
You can work backwards to find
the double helix structure.

00:26:01.620 --> 00:26:05.300
Hemoglobin, it was magnificent
and they started out

00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:07.180
with another burst
of Nobel Prizes

00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:10.900
one after another
for about 20 years.

00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:13.140
What happened next you'll
have to read elsewhere.

00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:15.640
So one can do it.

00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:17.990
Anyway, so I said we would
give the examples of science

00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:20.490
and then go back to business,
about which I'm profoundly not

00:26:20.490 --> 00:26:22.570
an expert, thus we can
have a discussion on that

00:26:22.570 --> 00:26:24.695
or later, we can have a
discussion about the curios

00:26:24.695 --> 00:26:25.420
about Einstein.

00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:27.650
You can ask me about
his blue parakeet,

00:26:27.650 --> 00:26:29.730
but I won't tell
you about that now.

00:26:29.730 --> 00:26:31.717
So this diagram, which
Einstein was so proud of

00:26:31.717 --> 00:26:33.050
and I showed you the picture of.

00:26:33.050 --> 00:26:35.380
Supposed you change
it a little bit.

00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:37.770
So down here, instead of
the expanding universe,

00:26:37.770 --> 00:26:40.309
which is noticed or
Mercury which is noticed.

00:26:40.309 --> 00:26:42.100
You have things like
something like there's

00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:45.230
a big internet, right?

00:26:45.230 --> 00:26:46.730
And then you go up
to there and say,

00:26:46.730 --> 00:26:48.480
what's going to be
a really good way

00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:50.060
to deal with a big internet?

00:26:50.060 --> 00:26:51.780
There were companies
like Yahoo and stuff

00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:55.040
that dealt with, I don't know,
they dealt with it in one way.

00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:57.730
What if you have the notion
up here, not G equals T.

00:26:57.730 --> 00:26:59.750
You're not doing tensors
and general relativity,

00:26:59.750 --> 00:27:03.490
but you say, I know a
really good search system

00:27:03.490 --> 00:27:05.980
plus maybe ads to monetize it.

00:27:05.980 --> 00:27:07.960
That's going to be a
good way to deal with it.

00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:09.751
So these things down
here are big internet.

00:27:09.751 --> 00:27:10.300
Wow.

00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:11.930
It applies to it really
well, and there's

00:27:11.930 --> 00:27:13.070
all sorts of other
things that applies

00:27:13.070 --> 00:27:14.230
to it really, really well.

00:27:14.230 --> 00:27:16.355
Certain companies come to
mind that were very, very

00:27:16.355 --> 00:27:17.469
good at that.

00:27:17.469 --> 00:27:18.260
So isn't that neat?

00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:19.490
So that same logical form.

00:27:19.490 --> 00:27:20.490
There's data down there.

00:27:20.490 --> 00:27:22.270
There's stuff in the real world.

00:27:22.270 --> 00:27:23.920
You make a jump of
abstraction, which

00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:25.870
isn't going to come from
anybody telling you.

00:27:25.870 --> 00:27:28.430
You have to be exceptional,
like Rutherford at the Cavendish

00:27:28.430 --> 00:27:31.730
lab, like Einstein in
1916 to come up to it.

00:27:31.730 --> 00:27:35.110
And once you're up into it, also
ordinary people, ordinary skill

00:27:35.110 --> 00:27:37.990
people, you put them in that
chair, they can do good stuff.

00:27:37.990 --> 00:27:40.540
Captain Kirk is sitting
inside a wonderful Chair.

00:27:40.540 --> 00:27:42.480
He could not create the
Starship Enterprise.

00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:44.670
Any of us sitting in
that chair, including

00:27:44.670 --> 00:27:46.720
Justin Long from
Galaxy Quest, will

00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:48.720
be able to press buttons,
and shoot, and just do

00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:50.530
all sorts of cool
stuff, if you're

00:27:50.530 --> 00:27:52.270
in the right perch
and position, you

00:27:52.270 --> 00:27:53.780
have magnificent power, right?

00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:55.840
People can come into
a company like this

00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:58.020
and when this matches
that, they don't

00:27:58.020 --> 00:28:00.810
have to be the terrific
entrepreneurs or geniuses who

00:28:00.810 --> 00:28:01.770
come up with this.

00:28:01.770 --> 00:28:03.690
They just walk right in there.

00:28:03.690 --> 00:28:06.850
Now, Neils Bohr was able to
walk across from this to that.

00:28:06.850 --> 00:28:08.650
He was a very flexible man.

00:28:08.650 --> 00:28:12.360
The thing is, not
everybody does.

00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:13.770
So this worked really well.

00:28:13.770 --> 00:28:15.645
So well, a company like
this, and again, this

00:28:15.645 --> 00:28:18.330
is purely speculative, will a
company like this last forever?

00:28:18.330 --> 00:28:21.250
Well, there's lots of new
stuff coming on down here.

00:28:21.250 --> 00:28:23.480
So apps can be sometimes
hard to search.

00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:24.950
That can be like
a walled garden.

00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:26.320
There's concerns with privacy.

00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:28.904
There's all sorts of
stuff like that going on.

00:28:28.904 --> 00:28:31.320
There's notions of how do you
discover things that haven't

00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:33.120
already been categorized.

00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:34.540
Just lots of new stuff.

00:28:34.540 --> 00:28:36.580
And then there's even
stranger things happening.

00:28:36.580 --> 00:28:38.550
When this company,
here, was formed,

00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:41.080
hipsters and [INAUDIBLE]
didn't exist. [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:42.360
was a terrible slum.

00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:43.740
Brooklyn was a
place where people

00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:46.290
went if they got divorced
and didn't have any money.

00:28:46.290 --> 00:28:48.700
So there's people with a
slightly different culture,

00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:50.710
maybe people who don't
like to own cars.

00:28:50.710 --> 00:28:52.160
It's no longer cool to own cars.

00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:53.640
It isn't part of
your definition.

00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:55.360
A better definition
could be, I don't

00:28:55.360 --> 00:28:58.000
know, having real life
experiences, live music

00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:59.730
or genuine fitness,
or triathlons.

00:28:59.730 --> 00:29:00.810
Something like that.

00:29:00.810 --> 00:29:04.960
So new categories are coming up.

00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:07.694
Very occasionally people from
here can change themselves,

00:29:07.694 --> 00:29:08.860
but it usually doesn't work.

00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:10.740
Remember, the Cavendish
lab had to jump over

00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:12.350
to a different view.

00:29:12.350 --> 00:29:15.300
They couldn't modify looking
what's inside the atom.

00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:17.700
To go in there, they had
to have new people come in.

00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:18.990
Rutherford died.

00:29:18.990 --> 00:29:20.800
Max Planck, the
great physicist, once

00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:23.930
said, "You never out argue your
opponents, you out live them."

00:29:23.930 --> 00:29:25.530
And that's something.

00:29:25.530 --> 00:29:26.440
So went over there.

00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:28.610
Occasionally, a person
can make that move across

00:29:28.610 --> 00:29:29.530
and move sideways.

00:29:29.530 --> 00:29:32.335
So think of, again to
the extent, if search

00:29:32.335 --> 00:29:33.710
is going to have
limits with some

00:29:33.710 --> 00:29:36.560
of these other things over
here, new data bits on here,

00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:38.080
suppose you have something else.

00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:38.810
Alphabet.

00:29:38.810 --> 00:29:40.050
Lots of things over here.

00:29:40.050 --> 00:29:40.790
Quite different.

00:29:40.790 --> 00:29:42.971
So there's a big structure.

00:29:42.971 --> 00:29:43.470
Like that.

00:29:43.470 --> 00:29:45.960
And then from there, you can
maybe apply to these things

00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:48.590
better, you can apply to
those, and maybe, who knows

00:29:48.590 --> 00:29:49.910
fresh things will come up.

00:29:49.910 --> 00:29:50.670
We don't know.

00:29:50.670 --> 00:29:53.950
Now the question is,
who fills those slots?

00:29:53.950 --> 00:29:55.180
Who fills those slots?

00:29:55.180 --> 00:29:57.200
Einstein went to
one slot up here

00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:58.793
and he could not move across.

00:29:58.793 --> 00:29:59.840
Neils Bohr said, come.

00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:00.340
Come on.

00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:01.370
It's different from
what you've learned.

00:30:01.370 --> 00:30:01.920
Come on.

00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:03.860
Yes, you were really great
at university doing this.

00:30:03.860 --> 00:30:05.901
Yes, you were terrific
coming up with these tools

00:30:05.901 --> 00:30:08.760
and these tensors, come over
here and use this new stuff.

00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:10.280
You'll come up
with great things.

00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:13.200
And the sadness, the pathos,
is that Einstein's mind

00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:14.370
was up to it.

00:30:14.370 --> 00:30:17.429
As an older man, he
said, one implication

00:30:17.429 --> 00:30:19.470
of this quantum mechanics,
if it were to be true,

00:30:19.470 --> 00:30:20.920
is quantum entanglement.

00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:21.990
That's almost impossible.

00:30:21.990 --> 00:30:23.700
His mathematics
was exactly right.

00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:27.452
This in 1935.

00:30:27.452 --> 00:30:29.910
A century after that, I think
we'll have quite nice quantum

00:30:29.910 --> 00:30:30.560
computers.

00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:32.197
A bit specialized,
but doing well.

00:30:32.197 --> 00:30:33.780
He came up with
gravitational lensing.

00:30:33.780 --> 00:30:35.500
All of this is as an old man.

00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:37.970
His brain was terrific, but he
just ventured there briefly,

00:30:37.970 --> 00:30:38.970
and would go right back.

00:30:38.970 --> 00:30:40.920
Oh, I've got to do
it this old way.

00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:43.040
So very rarely, can
one move across.

00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:45.540
Sometimes you have to
acquire brand new people.

00:30:45.540 --> 00:30:47.040
That's why many
companies do well.

00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:51.300
They have entire new groups,
either spun off or brought in

00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:51.990
or something.

00:30:51.990 --> 00:30:53.950
Occasionally, however,
magnificent people like,

00:30:53.950 --> 00:30:56.964
Bork can go up and work
across themselves and step,

00:30:56.964 --> 00:30:59.130
step by step into these
different things, which will

00:30:59.130 --> 00:31:00.600
have those fresh implications.

00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:03.160
So I leave you with a
question, are we Niels Bohr,

00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:04.282
or are we Albert Einstein?

00:31:04.282 --> 00:31:05.990
And after reading this
book you'll think,

00:31:05.990 --> 00:31:08.410
gosh, I used to think
Einstein was terrific,

00:31:08.410 --> 00:31:11.150
but now I don't want
to be like him at all.

00:31:11.150 --> 00:31:11.934
Thank you.

00:31:11.934 --> 00:31:17.339
[APPLAUSE]

00:31:17.339 --> 00:31:19.630
SPEAKER: Thank you very much
we have time for questions

00:31:19.630 --> 00:31:22.948
so please wait for a microphone.

00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:31.390
AUDIENCE: So Einstein created
Schrodinger's cat, didn't he?

00:31:31.390 --> 00:31:32.256
DAVID BODANIS: Yes.

00:31:32.256 --> 00:31:35.751
AUDIENCE: So that was basically
saying quantum physics is

00:31:35.751 --> 00:31:36.500
ridiculous, right?

00:31:40.579 --> 00:31:42.370
DAVID BODANIS: I don't
want to ask hands up

00:31:42.370 --> 00:31:45.110
of people who don't know
about Schrodinger's cat

00:31:45.110 --> 00:31:47.250
so I'll give a background.

00:31:47.250 --> 00:31:49.790
One conclusion, I would
say, is that if a man named

00:31:49.790 --> 00:31:51.880
Schrodinger, if you were
transformed into a cat,

00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:52.940
like you stepped
out of the internet,

00:31:52.940 --> 00:31:54.096
and, oh, I'm a cat
and stuff, and there's

00:31:54.096 --> 00:31:55.679
these strange people
around, and a man

00:31:55.679 --> 00:31:57.710
named Schrodinger comes
up to you smiling says,

00:31:57.710 --> 00:31:59.126
would you like to
go home with me?

00:31:59.126 --> 00:32:01.250
The answer is, no,
under no circumstances.

00:32:01.250 --> 00:32:02.620
It's not a good idea.

00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:04.820
Schrodinger was a man
that Einstein really loved

00:32:04.820 --> 00:32:06.830
because of his personal life.

00:32:06.830 --> 00:32:08.900
Schrodinger's wife
used to reward him

00:32:08.900 --> 00:32:10.280
when he had great results.

00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:12.580
She would introduce him
to really nice twins

00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:14.580
to go off to the
mountain with and stuff.

00:32:14.580 --> 00:32:17.940
They said about Schrodinger when
he came to Oxford in the 1930s,

00:32:17.940 --> 00:32:20.210
"To arrive at Oxford with
one wife is bad enough,

00:32:20.210 --> 00:32:22.420
to arrive with two,
really excessive."

00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:23.940
So Schrodinger
had this wild sort

00:32:23.940 --> 00:32:25.770
of bohemian life,
which Einstein liked.

00:32:25.770 --> 00:32:27.895
That's one reason Einstein
grew his hair like that.

00:32:27.895 --> 00:32:29.936
When he was young, he was
actually kind of dishy.

00:32:29.936 --> 00:32:31.030
He was a good looking guy.

00:32:31.030 --> 00:32:34.020
When he was rowing, people said,
whoa, really muscly and stuff.

00:32:34.020 --> 00:32:36.150
And he would sail
and row and stuff.

00:32:36.150 --> 00:32:38.460
But later in bourgeois
Berlin in the 1920s,

00:32:38.460 --> 00:32:40.202
he wanted to fight
that to say, you

00:32:40.202 --> 00:32:42.160
don't have to line up
and be exactly like that.

00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:44.641
His second wife was
incredibly particular.

00:32:44.641 --> 00:32:46.640
Albert, I don't think
that's quite the right way

00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:47.400
to hold our forks.

00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:48.191
That sort of thing.

00:32:48.191 --> 00:32:51.394
So we did the hair as
some sort of resistance.

00:32:51.394 --> 00:32:53.060
So he liked Schrodinger,
and the two men

00:32:53.060 --> 00:32:54.290
were really good friends.

00:32:54.290 --> 00:32:57.040
And they collaborated in
the mid-1930s by letter.

00:32:57.040 --> 00:33:00.240
Schrodinger had gotten a job
in Dublin, of all places.

00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:03.240
It turns out, the guy who ran
Ireland at the time, de Valera,

00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:04.240
had studied mathematics.

00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:06.070
So he respected Schrodinger.

00:33:06.070 --> 00:33:08.610
And in their correspondence,
they came up with this notion.

00:33:08.610 --> 00:33:10.440
It turns out very
often, people come up

00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:12.200
with a notion to
disprove a theory,

00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:14.520
and that notion is really good.

00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:16.399
And the reason is, we
don't like humiliation.

00:33:16.399 --> 00:33:17.190
We don't like fear.

00:33:17.190 --> 00:33:19.790
A friend of mine was a very
successful TV and film writer

00:33:19.790 --> 00:33:20.532
and producer.

00:33:20.532 --> 00:33:21.490
And he was really good.

00:33:21.490 --> 00:33:23.930
Then when he got a lot of money,
he sort of lost his creativity.

00:33:23.930 --> 00:33:26.100
And he tried all sorts of ways
to get his creativity back.

00:33:26.100 --> 00:33:28.260
He tried working with bright
young people, going to museums,

00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:29.426
working in different fields.

00:33:29.426 --> 00:33:30.180
None of it worked.

00:33:30.180 --> 00:33:32.150
And then his business
partner ripped him off.

00:33:32.150 --> 00:33:33.370
And boy, was he motivated.

00:33:33.370 --> 00:33:35.080
He started writing
terrific stuff.

00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:37.420
So Einstein still
disliked the fact

00:33:37.420 --> 00:33:38.800
he'd been pushed to the side.

00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:40.860
So that brought
up his creativity

00:33:40.860 --> 00:33:41.790
to a real high level.

00:33:41.790 --> 00:33:44.484
If you're fired from a
company, you want to show them.

00:33:44.484 --> 00:33:45.400
You're full of energy.

00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:46.360
You have to show them.

00:33:46.360 --> 00:33:48.170
So he came up with,
in correspondence,

00:33:48.170 --> 00:33:48.878
with Schrodinger.

00:33:48.878 --> 00:33:51.419
Schrodinger was
involved a little bit

00:33:51.419 --> 00:33:52.960
with this notion of
Heisenberg's cat,

00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:55.820
that if there's no
way, whatsoever,

00:33:55.820 --> 00:33:57.230
to predict if a
certain particles

00:33:57.230 --> 00:34:00.270
going to decay this
way or decay that way,

00:34:00.270 --> 00:34:02.020
then the following
curious effect happens.

00:34:02.020 --> 00:34:04.730
And sorry, suppose you
can't predict which way it's

00:34:04.730 --> 00:34:08.980
going to go, and will you
only know or will it only

00:34:08.980 --> 00:34:10.330
happen once you look at it?

00:34:10.330 --> 00:34:12.380
Suppose that particles
inside a box.

00:34:12.380 --> 00:34:15.159
Suppose the poor cat
is inside the box.

00:34:15.159 --> 00:34:16.929
Suppose a large gun.

00:34:16.929 --> 00:34:20.080
You see the viciousness of quiet
often vegetarian physicist.

00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:23.150
They're like, should the
gun have impaling hooks?

00:34:23.150 --> 00:34:26.040
Should there be a little
trapdoor underneath?

00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:28.513
And suppose, if the particle
decays and goes this way,

00:34:28.513 --> 00:34:29.179
nothing happens.

00:34:29.179 --> 00:34:31.000
The cat walks around.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:32.770
If the particle decays
and goes that way,

00:34:32.770 --> 00:34:37.300
a big gun blasts it
to smithereens, right?

00:34:37.300 --> 00:34:41.489
In a standard interpretation
of quantum mechanics,

00:34:41.489 --> 00:34:43.540
not only do you not
only know until you

00:34:43.540 --> 00:34:48.929
open the box which way
the particles decayed,

00:34:48.929 --> 00:34:50.650
it hasn't happened.

00:34:50.650 --> 00:34:53.550
It's ambiguous until
you open it and look,

00:34:53.550 --> 00:34:56.030
that the actual observation
helps create it.

00:34:56.030 --> 00:34:57.510
Einstein thought
that was insane.

00:34:57.510 --> 00:34:59.510
But yet, a lot of
evidence, again, I'm

00:34:59.510 --> 00:35:02.250
being metaphorical about it, a
lot of evidence backed it up.

00:35:02.250 --> 00:35:03.750
The question, of
course, is Einstein

00:35:03.750 --> 00:35:06.490
said, well, in that case,
is the cat alive or dead

00:35:06.490 --> 00:35:07.930
before you open the box, right?

00:35:07.930 --> 00:35:09.750
We don't know which
way the particle went

00:35:09.750 --> 00:35:11.294
and if the trigger
was pulled or not.

00:35:11.294 --> 00:35:12.460
So is the cat alive or dead?

00:35:12.460 --> 00:35:15.090
And clearly it can't be in a
superposition of two states,

00:35:15.090 --> 00:35:16.270
half dead and half alive.

00:35:16.270 --> 00:35:18.020
On the other hand, if
any of you have ever

00:35:18.020 --> 00:35:20.750
taken the northern line in
London at about 8:00 AM,

00:35:20.750 --> 00:35:22.450
you understand,
many people can be

00:35:22.450 --> 00:35:24.140
in that superposition
of two states,

00:35:24.140 --> 00:35:27.240
half dead and half alive.

00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:28.670
And they came up
with that notion

00:35:28.670 --> 00:35:30.650
to sort of disprove
quantum mechanics.

00:35:30.650 --> 00:35:33.000
And people like Niels Bohr
and other bright young people

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.180
working with him
thought, good point.

00:35:35.180 --> 00:35:35.750
Good point.

00:35:35.750 --> 00:35:37.440
Yep, there's a
superposition of states

00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:38.910
until the observation
takes place

00:35:38.910 --> 00:35:40.330
and that has certain
consequences.

00:35:40.330 --> 00:35:42.180
And low and behold,
those consequences

00:35:42.180 --> 00:35:43.690
were used by John
Bardeen, who was

00:35:43.690 --> 00:35:46.840
working at Princeton at the
time, to develop transistor.

00:35:46.840 --> 00:35:48.140
It's actually true.

00:35:48.140 --> 00:35:49.520
How curious is that?

00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:52.100
Einstein wouldn't step
sideways to accept it

00:35:52.100 --> 00:35:54.150
because he had
been so comfortable

00:35:54.150 --> 00:35:56.890
in that previous position.

00:35:56.890 --> 00:35:58.629
I have a little
addendum to the answer,

00:35:58.629 --> 00:36:00.670
but I'm going to stop
giving really long answers.

00:36:00.670 --> 00:36:05.100
If there's time, Just remind me
about the playing card problem.

00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:07.718
But I'd like to have some
more questions first.

00:36:07.718 --> 00:36:09.086
SPEAKER: Who has questions?

00:36:12.724 --> 00:36:14.540
Any questions?

00:36:14.540 --> 00:36:17.205
DAVID BODANIS: Yeah.

00:36:17.205 --> 00:36:18.187
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:34.039 --> 00:36:36.080
DAVID BODANIS: So the
question is, how much of it

00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:38.220
was maybe not necessarily
religious but, just

00:36:38.220 --> 00:36:39.620
came from simple aesthetics?

00:36:39.620 --> 00:36:42.140
Beauty rather than
ugliness and crudest.

00:36:42.140 --> 00:36:44.150
The answer is a real lot.

00:36:44.150 --> 00:36:47.570
The possibilities are related.

00:36:47.570 --> 00:36:51.930
Einstein believed in the need
for architectural simplicity

00:36:51.930 --> 00:36:54.150
a little bit because
of his religious views.

00:36:54.150 --> 00:36:56.890
Einstein was once interviewed
what he felt about music.

00:36:56.890 --> 00:36:58.907
And he was like the boss,
you can never please.

00:36:58.907 --> 00:37:01.490
People said, Mendelssohn, what
do you think about Mendelssohn?

00:37:01.490 --> 00:37:04.140
He'd say, oh, Mendelssohn is
wonderful with beautiful lyric

00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:08.360
tunes, but he lacks a
certain architectural whole.

00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:09.463
What about Schumann?

00:37:09.463 --> 00:37:10.150
Oh, Schumann.

00:37:10.150 --> 00:37:12.440
I really feel for
Schumann, but it's not

00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:14.250
incredibly pure and right.

00:37:14.250 --> 00:37:16.660
What about Beethoven?

00:37:16.660 --> 00:37:18.290
Beethoven is terrific.

00:37:18.290 --> 00:37:20.830
It's emotional it's powerful,
but it's a little bit

00:37:20.830 --> 00:37:21.370
arbitrary.

00:37:21.370 --> 00:37:22.661
Aren't those emotions harbored?

00:37:22.661 --> 00:37:24.810
The one he loved
wasn't even Bach.

00:37:24.810 --> 00:37:28.340
He loved Mozart, because Mozart
is not just the surprise.

00:37:28.340 --> 00:37:30.420
That the thing with
Mozart is what comes next

00:37:30.420 --> 00:37:32.310
is unexpected, but plausible.

00:37:32.310 --> 00:37:33.120
How cool is that?

00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:35.190
Unexpected but plausible.

00:37:35.190 --> 00:37:37.230
It's like a really,
really good thriller,

00:37:37.230 --> 00:37:39.460
but often it felt true.

00:37:39.460 --> 00:37:41.910
It wasn't just a little game.

00:37:41.910 --> 00:37:44.529
You feel that a little
barrier has been removed

00:37:44.529 --> 00:37:46.320
and you're seeing the
truth of the universe

00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:49.590
and bits of Mozart, at least for
Einstein and sometimes for me.

00:37:49.590 --> 00:37:52.144
Can I just say as a footnote,
Mozart's "Clarinet Concerto,"

00:37:52.144 --> 00:37:54.560
which I once listened to when
I was in the south of France

00:37:54.560 --> 00:37:56.876
and had two recordings
for about a week,

00:37:56.876 --> 00:37:58.500
I can never hear that
again in my life.

00:37:58.500 --> 00:38:00.208
People tell me it's
beautiful, but please

00:38:00.208 --> 00:38:01.490
don't play it in my presence.

00:38:01.490 --> 00:38:03.590
But as for the aesthetics,
that would be it.

00:38:03.590 --> 00:38:05.680
And when Einstein was
dissatisfied and unhappy,

00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:06.910
when he was young he
played the violin.

00:38:06.910 --> 00:38:08.830
He played really well,
but when he was older

00:38:08.830 --> 00:38:11.100
his fingers got a little bit
arthritic, and what he loved

00:38:11.100 --> 00:38:12.600
was just noodling
away on the piano.

00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:15.410
He would noodle for hours and
hours on hours, and Berlin,

00:38:15.410 --> 00:38:16.910
and Princeton, a
little bit of jazz,

00:38:16.910 --> 00:38:20.654
a little bit of classical,
all sorts of stuff.

00:38:20.654 --> 00:38:22.070
Aesthetics meant
everything to him

00:38:22.070 --> 00:38:26.230
because he felt they were signs
of something very, very true.

00:38:26.230 --> 00:38:30.140
And it drove him into isolation.

00:38:30.140 --> 00:38:32.200
How sad is that?

00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:35.723
Next

00:38:35.723 --> 00:38:36.514
SPEAKER: Questions.

00:38:55.610 --> 00:38:56.860
DAVID BODANIS: Great question.

00:38:56.860 --> 00:39:00.140
So out of all the mistakes,
what was the worst,

00:39:00.140 --> 00:39:01.690
the most fundamental mistake.

00:39:01.690 --> 00:39:04.335
And many people think the
mistake was modifying the G

00:39:04.335 --> 00:39:05.420
equals T equation.

00:39:05.420 --> 00:39:08.110
Again, that's just a
metaphor, modifying and adding

00:39:08.110 --> 00:39:10.226
extra terms, but
that was a mistake,

00:39:10.226 --> 00:39:12.600
but it's a mistake that anybody
can make and then fix it.

00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:12.940
Oh, I see.

00:39:12.940 --> 00:39:13.580
I was wrong.

00:39:13.580 --> 00:39:15.330
And you go back with
the same attitude

00:39:15.330 --> 00:39:16.790
that he had when he was young.

00:39:16.790 --> 00:39:18.900
That you would climb up
here, which is beautiful,

00:39:18.900 --> 00:39:21.370
but then you would check things
against the consequences.

00:39:21.370 --> 00:39:23.510
And if ugly facts
really got in the way,

00:39:23.510 --> 00:39:25.510
you would have to change
this, however beautiful

00:39:25.510 --> 00:39:26.570
it was going up.

00:39:26.570 --> 00:39:28.790
So I think his mistake
wasn't the scientific mistake

00:39:28.790 --> 00:39:30.862
about the lambda,
the extra term,

00:39:30.862 --> 00:39:32.070
anybody could have done that.

00:39:32.070 --> 00:39:35.670
The mistake was
diving in and saying

00:39:35.670 --> 00:39:37.280
it was a psychological mistake.

00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:38.370
I've been burned once.

00:39:38.370 --> 00:39:40.520
I'm never going to be
burned again, right?

00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:42.950
Tony Blair had a
possibility early

00:39:42.950 --> 00:39:44.740
in his a tenure
as prime minister

00:39:44.740 --> 00:39:48.920
to help NATO forces go into
Kosovo, and a lot of people

00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:49.990
said, don't do that.

00:39:49.990 --> 00:39:50.822
It's imperialism.

00:39:50.822 --> 00:39:51.780
It's not going to work.

00:39:51.780 --> 00:39:53.113
It's really messy on the ground.

00:39:53.113 --> 00:39:54.030
He ignored them.

00:39:54.030 --> 00:39:57.450
He went into Kosovo, and on
the whole it worked quite well.

00:39:57.450 --> 00:40:00.240
A few years later he
wanted to go into Iraq.

00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:02.280
People said, don't go into Iraq.

00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:03.980
You're going to mess things up.

00:40:03.980 --> 00:40:06.420
It's a hornet's nest,
everything will get worse.

00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:09.664
And he said, they said that
before, and I was right.

00:40:09.664 --> 00:40:11.830
I stuck to my guns I'm going
to stick my guns again.

00:40:11.830 --> 00:40:13.970
And in fact, he was
wrong the second time.

00:40:13.970 --> 00:40:16.240
So that was Einstein's
problem, that second mistake.

00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:18.840
Now it happens a lot to people
who are at the top level,

00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:20.760
because they were so
successful before.

00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:23.440
If I have like a plausible
hypothesis, and then

00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:25.729
its proven wrong, and then
it's later proven right,

00:40:25.729 --> 00:40:27.770
that's nice but it's just
a plausible hypothesis,

00:40:27.770 --> 00:40:31.160
but if I come up with
general relativity, wow,

00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:35.090
and that's finally proven right
again, I'm really not cocky,

00:40:35.090 --> 00:40:38.280
but I'm very confident
in my beliefs.

00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:39.296
I'm speaking for myself.

00:40:39.296 --> 00:40:40.920
I feel I've been able
to find something

00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:42.180
true about the universe.

00:40:42.180 --> 00:40:46.290
The people who hustle really,
really hard to get to the top

00:40:46.290 --> 00:40:48.270
usually have one stick
one special approach

00:40:48.270 --> 00:40:50.190
that really, really
works, and they

00:40:50.190 --> 00:40:51.950
have to push hard to get it.

00:40:51.950 --> 00:40:53.480
And it's often a
magical approach

00:40:53.480 --> 00:40:55.450
it almost never happens twice.

00:40:55.450 --> 00:40:59.220
Lester Thurow, the guy at MIT,
who cruelly has been described

00:40:59.220 --> 00:41:01.880
as less than thorough,
which is mean,

00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:04.420
pointed out that hardly
anybody who creates a company,

00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:06.760
creates two different
companies, ever.

00:41:06.760 --> 00:41:08.450
Occasionally there's
people who do it.

00:41:08.450 --> 00:41:11.870
That idea, unfortunately,
came to me as a teenager.

00:41:11.870 --> 00:41:14.140
I read his book,
and it bothered me

00:41:14.140 --> 00:41:17.130
so much that the first time I
had a bestseller, I thought,

00:41:17.130 --> 00:41:18.860
yeah, well.

00:41:18.860 --> 00:41:20.900
But I had a second
one, 10 years later.

00:41:20.900 --> 00:41:22.070
I said, yes, Lester.

00:41:22.070 --> 00:41:23.200
Yes, we can do it.

00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:24.339
We can do a separate thing.

00:41:24.339 --> 00:41:25.380
First time could be luck.

00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:28.526
Second time OK, one knows
how to do this stuff.

00:41:28.526 --> 00:41:30.002
AUDIENCE: SoI have a question.

00:41:40.930 --> 00:41:43.790
DAVID BODANIS: I'm amazed at
what human beings could do,

00:41:43.790 --> 00:41:47.430
and also ordinary human beings.

00:41:47.430 --> 00:41:50.300
I grew up in an ordinary
Jewish family in Chicago

00:41:50.300 --> 00:41:52.810
after World War II, and many
people in the neighborhood

00:41:52.810 --> 00:41:55.030
would have a picture of
Einstein up on refrigerator

00:41:55.030 --> 00:41:58.080
or an encyclopedia about
this thing of Einstein,

00:41:58.080 --> 00:42:00.520
and I thought this is
a noble and good man.

00:42:00.520 --> 00:42:03.980
I feel some connection with him,
but I had no idea what he did.

00:42:03.980 --> 00:42:05.234
I had no idea.

00:42:05.234 --> 00:42:07.400
Some people, I don't know
if they invent a computer,

00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:09.910
or they invent a car,
or a particular device,

00:42:09.910 --> 00:42:11.676
or an airplane, it's beautiful.

00:42:11.676 --> 00:42:13.300
But when I was a
little child, I didn't

00:42:13.300 --> 00:42:14.466
know what Einstein had done.

00:42:14.466 --> 00:42:17.440
At university I learned
about it and I was amazed.

00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:19.880
It was sort of like listening
to Mozart for the first time

00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:23.320
or in my case Mozart especially
the "Clarinet Concerto,"

00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:25.180
but like a good
blues or something.

00:42:25.180 --> 00:42:27.985
You listen to it and feels
this is really true, sort of

00:42:27.985 --> 00:42:29.110
like on a really good date.

00:42:29.110 --> 00:42:31.400
On a mediocre date, you
tell your cute stories.

00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:33.700
They tell their cute stories,
but on a really good day

00:42:33.700 --> 00:42:34.750
you're just connected.

00:42:34.750 --> 00:42:36.260
You're just directly connected.

00:42:36.260 --> 00:42:38.200
There's no artifice from
top to bottom stuff.

00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:39.360
So when I was learning
about Einstein,

00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:41.170
I thought, wow, he cuts
through in the universe.

00:42:41.170 --> 00:42:42.294
He saw what's really there.

00:42:42.294 --> 00:42:46.940
This notion of geometry
inducing the sensation of force

00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:48.570
as with people going
to the North Pole

00:42:48.570 --> 00:42:50.830
and feeling it pull together
or the gravity coming

00:42:50.830 --> 00:42:52.070
that way, that's incredible.

00:42:52.070 --> 00:42:53.820
So I really wanted to
share it, and then I

00:42:53.820 --> 00:42:55.970
wanted to find out
how did he do it.

00:42:55.970 --> 00:42:57.410
I mean what, sort of man was he?

00:42:57.410 --> 00:42:58.680
What was his background?

00:42:58.680 --> 00:43:01.140
One thing that helps in
a background like that,

00:43:01.140 --> 00:43:03.954
is to be not a total outsider,
if you're a total outsider,

00:43:03.954 --> 00:43:05.620
you don't have enough
education, but not

00:43:05.620 --> 00:43:07.280
to be a total insider either.

00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:09.060
It helps to be sort
of on the edge.

00:43:09.060 --> 00:43:12.150
Moderate discrimination works
really, really well in science

00:43:12.150 --> 00:43:13.520
and in business very much.

00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:15.716
Total discrimination, they
don't give you a chance.

00:43:15.716 --> 00:43:17.590
Moderate discrimination,
you know two things.

00:43:17.590 --> 00:43:19.220
A You have to work
a little bit harder

00:43:19.220 --> 00:43:22.270
and B what you learned
before about the system

00:43:22.270 --> 00:43:23.590
isn't necessarily true.

00:43:23.590 --> 00:43:27.070
Suppose somebody grows up
say an extremely religious,

00:43:27.070 --> 00:43:29.260
fundamentalist, religious view.

00:43:29.260 --> 00:43:31.480
As a kid, they're taught
to say that the world is

00:43:31.480 --> 00:43:33.850
based on turtles and it's
turtles all the way down.

00:43:33.850 --> 00:43:35.730
They go to university,
and the people there

00:43:35.730 --> 00:43:37.867
who teach astronomy
say, that's nonsense.

00:43:37.867 --> 00:43:38.950
It's not like that at all.

00:43:38.950 --> 00:43:41.190
Here, I'm going to teach
you the latest results.

00:43:41.190 --> 00:43:42.800
This is what we know
is totally true.

00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:45.480
The person might think,
maybe, but maybe not.

00:43:45.480 --> 00:43:47.450
What my mother
taught me was wrong.

00:43:47.450 --> 00:43:49.570
Maybe what I learned
from you, may be that,

00:43:49.570 --> 00:43:51.571
not necessarily as wrong
as that previous thing,

00:43:51.571 --> 00:43:52.945
but I'll be a
little bit cynical.

00:43:52.945 --> 00:43:55.372
Compare that to somebody who
was, say a professor's kid,

00:43:55.372 --> 00:43:57.080
they grew up learning
the latest results,

00:43:57.080 --> 00:43:58.380
in a simplified version.

00:43:58.380 --> 00:44:01.260
These nice books you buy for
your kids when you feel guilty

00:44:01.260 --> 00:44:04.662
and you're watching Jack
Bauer save the day again.

00:44:04.662 --> 00:44:06.120
And then when they
go to university

00:44:06.120 --> 00:44:07.300
and it's more of the same.

00:44:07.300 --> 00:44:10.100
They have no reason to be
really, really critical.

00:44:10.100 --> 00:44:11.690
So Einstein was
enough of an outsider

00:44:11.690 --> 00:44:16.480
to be critical, but not so
much that he had no training.

00:44:19.462 --> 00:44:21.450
SPEAKER: Time for
more questions.

00:44:34.900 --> 00:44:39.270
DAVID BODANIS: Yeah, so how did
he hold onto his skepticism?

00:44:39.270 --> 00:44:42.690
I suppose he held up to it,
well a couple of reasons.

00:44:42.690 --> 00:44:45.740
One, he had seen that large
groups of people can be wrong.

00:44:45.740 --> 00:44:48.310
All the astronomers in
the world, everybody

00:44:48.310 --> 00:44:52.320
whether they were very
theoretical or very practical.

00:44:52.320 --> 00:44:54.140
they all were persuaded
that the universe

00:44:54.140 --> 00:44:57.220
was static for 10 years
or eight years and stuff.

00:44:57.220 --> 00:44:58.750
And it's like,
they've been wrong.

00:44:58.750 --> 00:44:59.520
They've been wrong once.

00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:01.200
What if they've been
wrong for 20 or 30 years?

00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:02.410
There were certain results.

00:45:02.410 --> 00:45:04.560
The ability to measure
things in the universe

00:45:04.560 --> 00:45:07.960
was very difficult. To measure
absolute distances is hard.

00:45:07.960 --> 00:45:11.150
We know that if we know the
absolute brightness of a car

00:45:11.150 --> 00:45:14.940
headlight at a certain distance
what we perceive of it,

00:45:14.940 --> 00:45:18.570
it is going to be high or
low, and then the intensity,

00:45:18.570 --> 00:45:21.030
and then we can work out
from an absolute magnitude

00:45:21.030 --> 00:45:22.130
how far away it is.

00:45:22.130 --> 00:45:24.420
So it took a long time
until astronomers,

00:45:24.420 --> 00:45:28.670
a woman named Henrietta
Leavitt in Boston,

00:45:28.670 --> 00:45:30.830
who managed to find
a way of measuring

00:45:30.830 --> 00:45:33.690
the distance to nearest
galaxies and that

00:45:33.690 --> 00:45:37.160
allowed us to get a proper
yardstick for the universe.

00:45:37.160 --> 00:45:38.930
So suppose Henrietta
Leavitt hadn't done

00:45:38.930 --> 00:45:41.620
that, 50 years may have passed.

00:45:41.620 --> 00:45:42.790
Einstein knew he was lucky.

00:45:42.790 --> 00:45:43.970
It only was 10 years.

00:45:43.970 --> 00:45:47.075
So it could have been past his
death, past his whole lifetime

00:45:47.075 --> 00:45:49.200
that people thought the
universe was static and low

00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:50.410
and behold it was not static.

00:45:50.410 --> 00:45:51.743
You know the greatest authority.

00:45:51.743 --> 00:45:52.490
So that was one.

00:45:52.490 --> 00:45:54.990
The other thing is,
in the 1920s and '30s

00:45:54.990 --> 00:45:57.000
he saw entire countries go mad.

00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:59.990
As countries go mad and nuts.

00:45:59.990 --> 00:46:03.700
In 1933, many books were
burned in Germany in public,

00:46:03.700 --> 00:46:07.107
including in the greatest
university town everywhere,

00:46:07.107 --> 00:46:08.690
in the world, then
it was [INAUDIBLE].

00:46:08.690 --> 00:46:12.390
It'd be like, could you imagine
if at Cambridge and, MIT and,

00:46:12.390 --> 00:46:15.705
all those places, they start
burning books with enthusiasm

00:46:15.705 --> 00:46:17.330
from the students,
and Einstein's books

00:46:17.330 --> 00:46:19.163
for some of those that
was there were burnt.

00:46:19.163 --> 00:46:20.560
It was non-Aryan physics.

00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:21.420
It was terrible.

00:46:21.420 --> 00:46:24.390
So he knew, hey, entire
organizations can go nuts.

00:46:24.390 --> 00:46:27.670
I just have to be
quiet and wait it out.

00:46:27.670 --> 00:46:28.470
But he was wrong.

00:46:34.342 --> 00:46:36.078
SPEAKER: There's no
more questions, then

00:46:36.078 --> 00:46:37.530
I think we can finish here.

00:46:37.530 --> 00:46:39.005
Thanks again, David Bodanis.

00:46:39.005 --> 00:46:40.046
DAVID BODANIS: Thank you.

00:46:40.046 --> 00:46:44.950
[APPLAUSE]
