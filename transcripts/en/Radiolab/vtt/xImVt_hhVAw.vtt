Hey Up Jad Abumrad I'm Robert Krulwich. This is Radiolab.

2
00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:08.850
And today today we are doing our black box, our yeah. And a black box is a,

3
00:00:08.851 --> 00:00:12.390
it's a thing. It's a box that when something goes in, you can see what that is.

4
00:00:12.391 --> 00:00:14.400
Something comes out, which is different and you can see that,

5
00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:18.450
but you do not know what's going on in the middle. It's a mystery. I love it.

6
00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.290
There's the, shall we go inside of course. And uh,

7
00:00:21.291 --> 00:00:25.230
our next and final black box comes from our producer Molly Webster.

8
00:00:25.231 --> 00:00:27.510
And it begins into the butter plier rain forest.

9
00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:29.383
<v 1>Oh.</v>

10
00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:35.970
<v 0>So that you can see the butterflies that are flying. In fact,</v>

11
00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.270
so a few days ago I was in Gainesville,

12
00:00:39.271 --> 00:00:44.271
Florida at the Florida Museum of natural history where they have a rainforest.

13
00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.190
It's what about three stories tall?

14
00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.280
It's like got a top that's all wrapped in a net.

15
00:00:49.281 --> 00:00:53.290
And then it was covered in butterflies. Oh my gosh. There's so many thousands.

16
00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:56.880
Yes. So these are highly corneas. Butterfly. That's the Andre Circle.

17
00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.900
I've thought of looking at butterflies when I was six years old and I have never

18
00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:03.390
grew up. He was my guide on the, you're on the,

19
00:01:03.391 --> 00:01:06.270
this leap even see an all butter phone.

20
00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.200
One wing is like the size of my palm.

21
00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.090
So there were red ones like in the yellow one blue ones. Striped ones. Is that,

22
00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:16.190
is that a monarch? Yes.

23
00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.520
Which don't step on this butterfly because it's like a Dr Sushi and land of

24
00:01:20.521 --> 00:01:23.780
butterflies. But I was there to look at the moment right before,

25
00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.100
before they become butterflies,

26
00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.060
which remains one of the most mysterious black boxes in nature.

27
00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.000
What I'm talking about is something called the Chrysalis. The chrysalis.

28
00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.840
Just tobacco. Yeah.

29
00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.950
At a certain point in all caterpillars lives after they've eaten a lot of

30
00:01:40.951 --> 00:01:44.760
leaves, they hit a certain weight that is coded in that gene.

31
00:01:44.761 --> 00:01:47.880
As their final weight hormones start pumping,

32
00:01:47.881 --> 00:01:52.560
some genetics turn on and it starts growing a little shell.

33
00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.830
That's the Chrysalis. And inside that Chrysalis, as we know,

34
00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.040
a Catholic pillar becomes a butterfly, a moth.

35
00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:00.603
<v 1>Um,</v>

36
00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.720
<v 0>and this is a mystery. What do you think happens inside the Chrysalis?</v>

37
00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:12.850
I think that actually, I've never thought about it to be honest. I don't know.

38
00:02:12.851 --> 00:02:15.880
I don't, I don't understand how it works. Not many people have.

39
00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.910
Are you like surprised that you actually don't know? Yeah, I'm surprised.

40
00:02:18.911 --> 00:02:22.420
I thought like I knew and I don't, those are folks I met at the museum.

41
00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.280
They hold up now that I've thought about it for a second,

42
00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.760
isn't it simply that um, the caterpillar is inside the shell.

43
00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.140
It sort of snuggles up and then it grows a wing off of his right side and then

44
00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.200
off its left side and it just pops wings out. No,

45
00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.720
that is actually what I thought. But that's not right at all.

46
00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.890
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

47
00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.050
<v 0>one, why are some days located on three floors? Because here's the thing.</v>

48
00:02:44.051 --> 00:02:46.030
So now we're going into the bowels of the building.

49
00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.850
When you take one of those little black boxes and you slice it open over the

50
00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:53.950
booth. Yes. Which Andre was nice enough to do for me. Sorry.

51
00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.750
Even though he loves these guys, he took a tiny little Chrysalis. Okay.

52
00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.370
It's a ball and inch long,

53
00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:05.260
which a caterpillar had just gotten into one day ago and he slowly began to cut

54
00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.620
taking our tweezer like scissors through the outer layer of the Chrysalis until

55
00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:12.613
she pupil

56
00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:15.103
<v 2>who?</v>

57
00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.100
<v 3>Oh my gosh, what? No, it was like there was no caterpillar bear.</v>

58
00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.420
What do you mean there's no head. There were no legs. There was no antenna,

59
00:03:27.421 --> 00:03:31.170
no spiky spine. It's like hail, white,

60
00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.550
yellow. It's very liquidy what was there.

61
00:03:35.551 --> 00:03:36.940
Then basically just goose,

62
00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.650
just like a runny goopy goo looks like snot.

63
00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.800
All you have to do is give it like a little [inaudible]

64
00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:46.640
<v 0>please, and then just went, oh, oh,</v>

65
00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:51.750
it is bullshit. Exploded. It exploded it.

66
00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.550
I think he looked shocked to wait. I don't understand.

67
00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:57.480
Where did the Caterpillar go?

68
00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.530
It seems like once the caterpillar gets into its shell, it's sort of just melts

69
00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.120
its head, legs on the abdomen.

70
00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:10.140
They all just dissolve muscles themselves, just sorta like

71
00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:15.230
<v 3>dissolve away into individual muscle cells and some of the cells rupture and so</v>

72
00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:18.450
their incise, the amino acids, the proteins,

73
00:04:18.451 --> 00:04:21.660
those all go floating out into space where you're sitting that caterpillar just

74
00:04:21.661 --> 00:04:26.350
becomes like a soup of cells. Yeah. And yet somehow

75
00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:30.370
magically be transformed

76
00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:33.850
<v 1>on a butterfly or a moth.</v>

77
00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.943
[inaudible]

78
00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:41.100
<v 0>well, how does that happen? That question, that question is the big fat,</v>

79
00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.940
metaphysical, quasi religious semi mystical,

80
00:04:44.941 --> 00:04:49.941
philosophical question that people have been asking for ever.

81
00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:55.910
<v 3>Yeah. So one of the big arguments that was taking place,</v>

82
00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:57.050
this is Matthew Cobb,

83
00:04:57.051 --> 00:05:01.100
he's a biologist and a historian and he says back in the 16 hundreds when

84
00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:04.070
naturalists saw that Goo, they just thought, oh, well,

85
00:05:04.071 --> 00:05:07.910
clearly what's happening is that the caterpillar goes into the Chrysalis and

86
00:05:07.911 --> 00:05:09.800
then it actually dies,

87
00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:14.510
totally dies and out of its burial cloth is going to come the new life,

88
00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:20.570
this beautiful and completely new creature, death as it were,

89
00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:23.540
and then a kind of resurrection.

90
00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:26.840
That's Phillip Clayton.

91
00:05:26.841 --> 00:05:30.110
He's a philosopher from the Claremont School of theology,

92
00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:31.910
and he says it from the beginning,

93
00:05:31.911 --> 00:05:36.500
people thought about and wrote about metamorphosis as a kind of spiritual ascent

94
00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:40.580
, said somewhere in the new testament, behold the old has passed away.

95
00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:42.500
The new has surely come.

96
00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:47.710
<v 0>Basically people saw the caterpillar as a symbol of art,</v>

97
00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:51.490
lowly earthbound, Lazy bodies, right?

98
00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:55.450
And then the butterfly was sort of casting away all of that.

99
00:05:55.451 --> 00:05:58.040
And it represented our soul up in heaven,

100
00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.680
sort of in its most perfect form.

101
00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:06.320
Nevermind that butterflies actually like to eat feces and urine and other on the

102
00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:09.640
substances according to Andre. Sounds tasty.

103
00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:14.620
Nevermind that the metaphor is like inspiring at some level, right?

104
00:06:14.621 --> 00:06:15.940
Because you think, oh, I've got all,

105
00:06:15.941 --> 00:06:19.410
I'm going to just become more a more perfect version of myself, right? Yeah.

106
00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:19.840
Yeah.

107
00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:24.340
But then the converse side of that is you cut open a Chrysalis and it looks like

108
00:06:24.341 --> 00:06:27.580
a whole bunch of Goo and you think it a hell of a lot of change.

109
00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:30.100
So the thing is is that this transformation,

110
00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:35.080
either of the butterfly or of my soul seems so dramatic,

111
00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:38.830
so miraculous that it made some people think like, Geez,

112
00:06:38.831 --> 00:06:42.250
if you're going to go to heaven in the process transformed that much,

113
00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:46.840
is it even you up there? It still has to be you that makes it to heaven.

114
00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:48.820
You can't change too much otherwise,

115
00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:51.220
like someone else will be up there enjoying your afterlife.

116
00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:56.280
So certain memories and elements of your identity have to continue just not all

117
00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:02.500
the elements. I'm so intrigued by that because I also think like

118
00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:08.800
what I'm like, what when you undergo such a transformation,

119
00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:13.870
what, what do they think carries through? That's a really interesting question.

120
00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:17.770
Cleaning out the poop and throwing away the the moldy leaves.

121
00:07:17.771 --> 00:07:20.890
You have a lot of time to think which brings us to Martha Weiss.

122
00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:24.310
I am an associate professor of biology at Georgetown University.

123
00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:27.940
She got to thinking about this question in more concrete terms. Okay,

124
00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:30.160
so she did an experiment.

125
00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:34.900
What we did was we took a big green caterpillar and we did something that was

126
00:07:34.901 --> 00:07:38.230
not entirely nice. She put them in a box,

127
00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:41.410
filled it with a nasty odor, and it's the odor,

128
00:07:41.411 --> 00:07:44.560
like an odor of a plant or it's actually a plant based odor,

129
00:07:44.561 --> 00:07:47.290
but it's smells kind of like a nail Polish remover. In any case,

130
00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:51.370
she gassed him with this nasty smell and then once they could smell the odor,

131
00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:54.610
then we gave them a zip. Is that just like a Zap?

132
00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:58.930
Just a Zip Zap, I think 10 seconds of Zap, 10 seconds.

133
00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:03.640
And they did this over and over. Odor, Zap, odor, Zap, Odell.

134
00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:08.290
Eventually most of these caterpillars learn to hate the smell.

135
00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:12.520
Every time they get a whiff, they head in the opposite direction. Okay,

136
00:08:12.521 --> 00:08:16.870
so then we let them pupate meaning the caterpillar changes into its shell and

137
00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:24.420
Oregon's dissolve muscles. Mel, you get this cataclysmic, catastrophic,

138
00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:26.040
chaotic change.

139
00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:35.890
And then one month later the moth emerges and now we're with the drum roll.

140
00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:37.640
We're ready for the drum roll.

141
00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:44.990
They give the moths a width. Okay. And the moths hate the smell.

142
00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:49.190
I mean normally Mosto care about the smell at all.

143
00:08:49.191 --> 00:08:52.970
It's like 50 50 but these moths hated it. Somehow I'm confused.

144
00:08:52.971 --> 00:08:55.890
What does that mean? That means a memory made it through the Goo.

145
00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:59.130
<v 3>Oh, and it came out the other side. Oh, what's your,</v>

146
00:08:59.131 --> 00:09:02.550
what's your feeling like coming out of this? My feeling is, wow.

147
00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:04.960
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

148
00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:09.960
<v 3>I think it's amazing that a caterpillar can have an experience go into its</v>

149
00:09:11.351 --> 00:09:12.184
Chrysalis,

150
00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:17.550
five weeks pass emerge as a seemingly different organism and that it still can

151
00:09:20.321 --> 00:09:25.060
recall experiences that happened to it when it was a caterpillar.

152
00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:26.630
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

153
00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:30.710
<v 3>and how does that happen? The answer to this question is we do not know, but,</v>

154
00:09:30.830 --> 00:09:35.830
but out there floating in that sea of Goo is actually a tiny little spec of

155
00:09:38.061 --> 00:09:41.600
brain. Some of the brain is dissolved away,

156
00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:46.630
but there's this like microscopic fragment that has made it through and Martha

157
00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:52.010
suspects that nestled into that fragment is this memory. Oh,

158
00:09:52.011 --> 00:09:54.770
it's like a little boop, like a little beacon.

159
00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:59.360
And it turns out there are others too.

160
00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:03.860
There's a speck of gut, some nerves,

161
00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:08.660
some muscle. It's not as Gooey as it seems. God, it's like,

162
00:10:08.661 --> 00:10:10.280
it's like I can't help wondering,

163
00:10:10.281 --> 00:10:13.910
what does the butterfly know about its caterpillar life?

164
00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:18.230
Like it knows this one tiny thing. But how much else does it know?

165
00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:21.350
It crawled that it has no answers that question.

166
00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:25.760
But Martha says that these types of questions like come up all the time.

167
00:10:25.761 --> 00:10:28.610
In fact, one of our colleagues, and I was talking to Doug the other day,

168
00:10:28.611 --> 00:10:32.760
and he said that he had gotten an email from a guy who was, uh,

169
00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:37.550
uh, I'm not exactly sure what flavor of Christian, but had,

170
00:10:37.730 --> 00:10:39.120
but he,

171
00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:44.030
he had gone into the whole resurrection thing and he felt like this was,

172
00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:45.051
you know,

173
00:10:45.051 --> 00:10:48.710
when he ascended that he wondered if he would then be able to remember his life

174
00:10:48.711 --> 00:10:49.544
on earth.

175
00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:54.310
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

176
00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:58.420
<v 3>well, here's the answer. What answer? Well, the answer,</v>

177
00:10:58.510 --> 00:11:02.520
the answer to the question about what carries through the continuity question.

178
00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:06.940
Oh, right, yes. And memory carries through, which is freaking cool.

179
00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.210
I gotta say, and it's freaking cool, but there's a little more freaking cool.

180
00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:13.570
All right. And that is that there's actually a continuity,

181
00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:17.720
but it goes in the reverse direction. What does that even mean? Well,

182
00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:20.990
Matthew Cop told me the story about this guy,

183
00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:24.920
<v 4>this a 17th century man who I never had never heard of John. Uh,</v>

184
00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:28.970
his name's written Sua Madame, but it's probably more pronounced as from a dump.

185
00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:33.020
Fama dumb. That's yawns farmer dom,

186
00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:35.630
a Dutch microscopist from the 16 hundreds.

187
00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:39.800
He was definitely the first to do some very clear dissections of the Chrysalis

188
00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:40.970
and the Caterpillar.

189
00:11:41.270 --> 00:11:46.270
And one day in Paris in front of this crowd of assembled worthies be wigged and

190
00:11:47.091 --> 00:11:49.460
a bit stocking. He gets a fat white caterpillar,

191
00:11:49.461 --> 00:11:53.950
gets a scalpel or a tiny little thin bit of glass and he, it,

192
00:11:53.951 --> 00:11:58.060
he just opens it up at the back along its back along line.

193
00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:02.860
And what he sees inside or what he can show them is that in fact there are some

194
00:12:02.861 --> 00:12:07.480
of the structures of the future, a butterfly, its wings,

195
00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:08.523
its antennae,

196
00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:14.130
and even its legs that are actually already formed even before PW patient takes

197
00:12:14.861 --> 00:12:15.650
place,

198
00:12:15.650 --> 00:12:19.790
<v 0>peel back the skin of a caterpillar.</v>

199
00:12:20.090 --> 00:12:23.810
And beneath that you see the uh, new,

200
00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:28.660
the new creature hidden. Absolutely. So bizarre.

201
00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:30.620
It's like,

202
00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:35.620
it's like if you were to skin me and there's my 70 year old self is inside of me

203
00:12:36.531 --> 00:12:37.364
or something.

204
00:12:38.270 --> 00:12:40.820
<v 3>Wait, the, the, and the wings also survived the Goo. Yeah.</v>

205
00:12:40.821 --> 00:12:45.821
So it's like a caterpillar will actually start to grow little tiny adult parts

206
00:12:46.071 --> 00:12:51.071
that are super thin and transparent and it just keeps them tightly rolled up and

207
00:12:51.441 --> 00:12:54.530
hidden up against the edges of the Chrysalis.

208
00:12:54.890 --> 00:12:58.160
But they don't actually ever go through the Gu or become the goo.

209
00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:02.130
<v 4>What he'd then shown was, you know what? This isn't about death.</v>

210
00:13:02.131 --> 00:13:05.880
This isn't about decay. This is actually about transformation.

211
00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:10.110
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

212
00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:11.750
<v 3>I dunno. It's kind of eerie.</v>

213
00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:16.780
Like it's not just what Ami carries forward into the future.

214
00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:19.123
It's like,

215
00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:23.660
what of my future self is in me right now?

216
00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:17.460
<v 1>[inaudible] [inaudible] I am all</v>

217
00:14:24.810 --> 00:14:25.643
[inaudible].

218
00:14:34.730 --> 00:14:35.563
Uh,

219
00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:46.700
I am

220
00:15:25.150 --> 00:15:28.810
<v 5>thanks to our producers, the Sour Tim Howard, Molly Webster, Jesse Cox,</v>

221
00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:30.910
and thanks to you guys for listening. Yeah.
