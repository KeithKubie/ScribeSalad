00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:05.930
A lot of discomfort about going to social
engagements is rooted in what can sound like

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:13.150
a rather high-minded concern: a hatred of
small talk. We can develop a dread of parties

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:18.590
because we know how likely we are to end up
wedged into conversations about the weather,

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:22.999
parking, traffic or the way we plan to spend
the forthcoming holidays – when there would

00:00:22.999 --> 00:00:28.669
be so many deeper and more dignified topics
to address: the future of humanity, the fate

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:34.120
of the nation, or the melancholy state of
our hearts. We resent parties for holding

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:40.039
up an ideal of community and dialogue while
trapping us in unproductive and insincere

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:46.260
banter; for making us more lonely than we
ever would be in our own homes. But we are

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:54.469
perhaps misunderstanding what small talk is
for and how we might gently find an exit from

00:00:54.469 --> 00:01:01.749
its more airless corners. Small talk exists
for a noble reason: it is designed to prevent

00:01:01.749 --> 00:01:07.600
hurt. It provides us with a rich source of
information so that we can safely ascertain

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.360
the frame of mind of our interlocutor – and
therefore gauge what more in-depth topics

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.590
of conversation might safely be broached.
The German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:22.471
once darkly reminded us that we should always
remember, when meeting new people, that they

00:01:22.471 --> 00:01:28.820
might be only be a few steps away from wanting
to grab a weapon and end their own lives.

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:35.550
A few moments of small talk give us the signals
we need to find out who we have on our hands;

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:40.730
it lends us time to circle intimacy from on
high before determining where we might wish

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:42.550
to land.

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:46.960
Furthermore, a rigid hatred of small talk
overlooks that it isn’t ever the subject

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:52.380
matter per se that determines the profundity
of a conversation. There are ways of talking

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:58.330
about death that are trivial and ways of addressing
the weather that feel significant. A truly

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:03.710
deep mind can exercise itself as much on the
game of a child as on the puzzles of philosophy

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.240
– and it is unfortunate snobbery to

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.421
discount a topic merely because it has never
featured in erudite academic curricula. We

00:02:11.421 --> 00:02:16.690
should take inspiration from how many great
artists have based their work around what

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:22.850
were, at heart, versions of ‘small talk’.
In the early 1820s, the English artist John

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:28.540
Constable painted fifty studies of the clouds
above Hampstead Heath in London, finding extraordinary

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:33.470
beauty and complexity in the ever-changing
quiet aerial drama above him.

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.500
John Constable, Cloud Study With no less open-mindedness,
at the end of the nineteenth century, the

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:43.200
French artist Paul Cézanne paid close attention
to the varied beauty of apples, painting dozens

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.710
of studies of these modest snacks laid out
in bowls and on sideboards. Paul Cézanne,

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:52.670
Still Life with Seven Apples Buddhism teaches
us that, to those gifted enough to see properly,

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:59.459
the whole world can be found in a single grain
of sand. We should perceive no insult in a

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:06.690
call to glimpse the grandest themes through
the lens of small talk. The skilled conversationalist

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:11.290
doesn’t insist that atmospheric or traffic
conditions or where a person has been at the

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:16.780
seaside are inherently unworthy of discussion.
They know that what a person feels about a

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:22.630
cloudy afternoon might be a highway to their
soul or that their experiences around parking

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:27.610
might provide clues as to their attitudes
to authority or their relations with their

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:32.920
parents. They are not put off by having to
work with humble matter; they are deft enough

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:40.200
to use whatever is to hand. The fear of small
talk reflects a worry, hugely understandable

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:45.490
and with roots in childhood experience, that
we will be unable to influence the flow of

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:50.520
a conversation by ourselves, that we will
be the victims of the obsession or pettiness

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:56.819
of others – and that conversation is fundamentally
a natural, organic occurrence which happens

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:04.650
to us but cannot be created by us; it may
at points be very engaging, at others hugely

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:10.260
frustrating; but the outcome is not ours to
determine. We can feel that when a person

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:15.819
says something, we must invariably respond
in a similar way: an anecdote about a golf

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:20.989
tournament needs to be followed by another;
if someone has a story about a booking confusion

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:26.979
at a hotel, the other must chip in with a
corollary. But, in truth, we have far more

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:32.300
conversational agency than this implies; it
is almost always in our power to raise more

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:37.229
intimate or profound follow-up questions.
And we can do so with the confidence that

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:42.050
few of us are ever committed to remaining
on the surface; we just don’t know how to

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:47.509
descend to the depths. An individual who is
currently talking at puzzling length about

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:54.250
an airline meal has also inevitably been disappointed
in love, had bouts of despair, tried to make

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:58.990
sense of a difficult parent, felt confused
about their direction – and will be longing,

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:04.659
at some level, therefore to stop talking about
cheese crackers and share the contents of

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:10.919
their heart. The confident conversationalist
does not take fright at small talk and others’

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:17.169
occasional apparently firm attachment to it.
They know that the small themes need only

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:23.069
ever be the first, understandable and never
insulting steps, towards the sincerity and

00:05:23.069 --> 00:05:27.520
intimacy all of us crave at heart.
