MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: Please
give a warm Google welcome

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:09.180
this morning to Questlove.

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:11.575
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:14.928 --> 00:00:16.365
AHMIR THOMPSON:
What's up, y'all?

00:00:16.365 --> 00:00:17.760
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
Good morning.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:18.900
Thanks for taking
the time to join us.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.566
AHMIR THOMPSON: Thank
you for having me.

00:00:20.566 --> 00:00:23.690
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: They didn't
keep you up too late last night

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:25.896
celebrating your
appearance on "Fallon"?

00:00:25.896 --> 00:00:27.020
AHMIR THOMPSON: No, no, no.

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:34.710
But I probably went
to bed at 4:30.

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:35.700
And I got up at 7:00.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.075
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
There you go.

00:00:37.075 --> 00:00:41.280
It seems like just the
right amount of time.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.040
AHMIR THOMPSON: I know people
think I'm joking about 19 jobs.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:52.020
But right now, I've
got seven to do today.

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.020
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: Well,
that leads me to right

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:55.520
how I wanted to
start, which is this

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.465
is your fourth book that
you've written and put out.

00:00:58.465 --> 00:01:00.840
And in and amongst
these 19 jobs,

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.410
I can't fathom the math as
to where you can possibly

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:07.530
find the time to even sit down
and begin to write a book,

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:08.910
let alone complete your fourth.

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:09.922
How do you do that?

00:01:09.922 --> 00:01:12.130
AHMIR THOMPSON: I think once
you decide to go there--

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.790
I mean, I don't recommend--

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.660
there were days where we
would look at Bo Jackson

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.532
25 years ago, like how does
he play football and baseball

00:01:21.532 --> 00:01:22.240
at the same time?

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:23.460
Wow, you know.

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.960
I guess it's like
my dad instilled

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.499
in me hard work early.

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:34.290
I started working--

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.610
I mean, there are
laws against that now.

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.190
Well, there were laws
against that then.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.380
When I was five, I
grew up in an era

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.000
where parents didn't
believe in babysitters.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.580
So when I was five,
my dad was like, OK,

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.330
I'm going to find
something for you to do.

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.890
My father was an oldies doo-wop
singer back in the '50s.

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:06.980
So by the time I was born,
that was his second go-round,

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:12.080
the nostalgia era, just like
now we'll see old school,

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.220
like the '90s are in.

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.510
So whatever was hitting
on "TRL" 20 years ago,

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.112
they'll have the revival
shows at Madison Square

00:02:20.112 --> 00:02:21.320
Garden or that sort of thing.

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.870
So for him, that was
the oldies doo-wop,

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.840
the music of his teenage years.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.050
He was having his
second wind of nostalgia

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.120
playing Madison
Square Garden or Radio

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.910
City with the acts of his era.

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:43.880
So for me, he taught
me how to pack luggage,

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:44.970
store it in the car.

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.100
So I'm really, really
good at Tetris right now.

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:53.690
When I was seven, he taught
me to be a stage manager.

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.020
So I would go to
these nightclubs.

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:02.510
I'd go to these nightclubs and
cut gels, set the spotlights,

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.310
work the spotlights,
which is weird.

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:11.810
Because I often joke that all
my interns at NBC are of age,

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:13.310
like over 21.

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.270
And I see them as babies.

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:22.250
I wouldn't trust them to
get the coffee I want.

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.260
Let alone, what
seven-year-old goes

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.441
to a nightclub with a ladder
and starts cutting gels?

00:03:27.441 --> 00:03:29.690
The nightclub owner's like,
yeah, this seven-year-old,

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:31.020
he can operate my system.

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:36.650
So I was operating the
light system by seven.

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:43.950
When I was, I think at
11, my dad's drummer

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.570
got in a motorcycle accident.

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:50.580
And Dad didn't even sweat it.

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.890
He just looked at me like,
well, you know the show.

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:53.810
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: You've
got drum parts to learn.

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:55.601
AHMIR THOMPSON: You're
the band leader now.

00:03:55.601 --> 00:03:57.980
So we were at Radio
City Music Hall, though.

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:01.470
And so they ran me
down to Macy's on 34th,

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.620
got me a suit
jacket and a shirt.

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:08.190
And then my very
first show drumming

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:09.880
was at 11 at Radio
City Music Hall.

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:11.940
I was my dad's bandleader.

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.190
So I mean, he always just--

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:19.379
I'm just numb to the idea
of, aah, too much work!

00:04:19.379 --> 00:04:21.000
You know, that sort of thing.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.664
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: So
is that still true today?

00:04:23.664 --> 00:04:25.080
From the moment,
you're awake it's

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.290
just grinding out
every single next step

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:29.970
to get through your day?

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:31.200
AHMIR THOMPSON: It's true.

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:36.290
I mean, to be honest
with you, I think

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:39.230
this is a rare third wind.

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:42.900
Not many people get three
chances for whatever

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.470
the idea of the brass ring is.

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:48.650
Our first go-round,
I'll say that after four

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:54.620
years of this kind of "the
little train that could"

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:58.700
journey that we were
having as The Roots, when

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:03.380
we won our first Grammy
for our fourth album,

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:08.450
"Things Fall Apart," then
suddenly doors started to open.

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:11.560
And a lot of times,
especially back then,

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.860
where it just seemed like
the doors were about to open,

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:16.700
there was like $2
million video budgets.

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:22.160
And it was the days where
people were just lighting up

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.620
cigars with $100 bills
and that sort of thing,

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:25.670
not a care in the world.

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:28.430
What recession?

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:32.175
And you yourself
think that, OK, well,

00:05:32.175 --> 00:05:33.800
"Rolling Stone" just
called us the best

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:36.510
live act of the last 25 years.

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:37.910
So we'll be here forever.

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:40.280
Everyone thinks,
we'll be here forever.

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:45.980
And then in 2004, I
realized that wasn't true.

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:49.850
We had shot a movie with
Dave Chappelle called

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:54.590
"Block Party," which
was a collection

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:56.570
of like-minded
artists and whatnot.

00:05:56.570 --> 00:06:00.932
And I'll say that the beginning
of that parenthesis, the reason

00:06:00.932 --> 00:06:02.390
why all those
artists came together

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:05.480
was because, back
in 1997, we used

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:08.060
to have these jam sessions
in our living room

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:11.150
and at our studio with
an unknown Jill Scott,

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:14.156
with an unknown Erykah, with--

00:06:14.156 --> 00:06:14.780
who's this guy?

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:16.400
Oh, Mos, OK, cool.

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:18.910
And Eve, and Beanie
Sigel, and Freeway.

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:23.270
And the first generation
of neo-soul Philadelphians

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:25.010
that eventually
got record deals,

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:29.450
we would have these
jam sessions weekly.

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:34.400
And 23 record deals
eventually came from that.

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:37.220
Some of them surpassed
us, that sort of thing.

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:45.290
But something told
me that that was

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:49.250
going to be the end
of the parenthesis.

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:53.150
I told people even
back then, oh man, I

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:55.640
feel like I'm a ghost
walking through my funeral.

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:58.970
I know we're never going
to work with each other

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:00.830
again in the same capacity.

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:07.070
Before then, it was like we just
all sleep in the same studio,

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:09.830
working on each other's
music, go to Studio A,

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:11.840
work on D'Angelo's a
bit, go to Studio B,

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:13.400
work on Erykah a little bit.

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:16.850
I've got to go see Jill for
a second, that sort of thing.

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:20.780
It was just like
all in the family.

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:26.420
And I knew something told
me that that movie was

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:27.820
going to be the end of it.

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:29.300
And I was actually fine with it.

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:30.770
And in some ways, it was.

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:33.590
Because the only new
addition to that show

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:38.780
was Kanye, who, I'll say, a year
before was hanging on the set

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:41.120
mostly with Kweli and whatnot.

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:49.080
And the new blood
reaction to his arrival

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:50.790
just sparked something
in our audience.

00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:52.340
And I was like, oh, I get it.

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:55.820
This is the last
stop of my train,

00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:57.590
and this is the
beginning of his journey.

00:07:57.590 --> 00:07:59.840
And he's going to
be the new leader.

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:03.390
And I wondered, what
were we going to do?

00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:07.460
OK, so do we just
become a nostalgia act?

00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:08.570
Do we coast?

00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:12.590
Because there are
even times where

00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:17.150
acts that have sold out Madison
Square Garden, or our opening

00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:19.280
act--

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:22.700
that just messed with
me so hard, like, wow,

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:25.040
I grew up with these people.

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:26.600
We should be opening for them?

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:27.370
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
Yeah, having it flipped.

00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:28.870
AHMIR THOMPSON:
Yeah, hip-hop really

00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:32.230
doesn't make kind
to legacy acts.

00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:35.530
And we're kind of a
disposable culture, where

00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:37.480
it's just like, OK, we're done.

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:41.890
So I wondered, what's
going to be in 2006, 2007.

00:08:41.890 --> 00:08:47.560
So once the "Tonight
Show" came, I thought--

00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:58.670
we started it so that we could
have a stable family life.

00:08:58.670 --> 00:09:03.830
Because it's impossible to
live 285 days on the road

00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:08.760
and have a family.

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:12.320
So I thought this was just
going to be a nice place for us

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:15.800
to die in obscurity.

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:17.920
Like, OK, whatever
happened to The Roots?

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:18.920
You remember those guys?

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:22.310
Oh OK, they're on that
show with Jimmy Fallon.

00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:27.800
But the last thing I
thought about was it's

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:30.080
going to work and actually
work in your favor.

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:35.000
So once it started
working in our favor

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.670
and it started to bloom,
then I realized like,

00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:45.480
oh, OK, this is another chance.

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:50.690
So then I spent the last
eight years just like,

00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:52.140
OK, teach at NYU?

00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:52.979
OK, I'll do it.

00:09:52.979 --> 00:09:53.520
Write a book?

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:54.420
I'll do it.

00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:54.930
DJ here?

00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:57.510
I'll do it.

00:09:57.510 --> 00:09:59.660
Score this Broadway musical?

00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:00.992
I'll do it, that sort of thing.

00:10:00.992 --> 00:10:02.700
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
Just keep saying yes.

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:04.408
AHMIR THOMPSON: I said
yes to everything.

00:10:04.408 --> 00:10:07.400
And so now I'm
starting to taper off.

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:15.216
And I just want one job that
pays you what the 19 do.

00:10:15.216 --> 00:10:17.700
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: Well,
that's a good segue.

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:20.500
Because the reason why I
ask about the day-to-day,

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:23.110
and about that grind, and about
that mentality of just saying

00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:27.210
yes, is, the book is not
necessarily an instruction

00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:29.400
manual on how to be creative.

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:31.959
It's like a marker
along the way.

00:10:31.959 --> 00:10:33.750
AHMIR THOMPSON: Yeah,
I make it super clear

00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:36.460
that I find those
types of books corny.

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:40.990
So at least in the
first paragraph,

00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:46.110
I just start at the bat
and say that, one, I don't

00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:47.430
know if I'm creative myself.

00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:59.280
Because I kind of feel like I'm
the guy that is the sidekick.

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:01.240
And I observe
people's creativity.

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:03.940
To me, that's the best
seat in the house.

00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:07.270
So I'm next to Jimmy.

00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:08.740
I'm next to Black Thought.

00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:09.820
I'm next to D'Angelo.

00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:13.180
I'm next to Lin Manuel.

00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:17.740
I'm the costar in
someone's story.

00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:18.910
And I kind of like that.

00:11:18.910 --> 00:11:25.880
Because I obsess more of the
engine than I ever did the car.

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:31.040
So yeah, I make that
clear at the top,

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:35.020
that I don't know if I'm
a creative myself more

00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:38.860
than a great observer
and a lucky participant.

00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:42.430
And then these are
just my experiences

00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:44.350
that I think could help you.

00:11:44.350 --> 00:11:50.650
Because I often talk about that
10,000-hour Malcolm Gladwell

00:11:50.650 --> 00:11:51.790
genius theory.

00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:55.270
And I've got to tell
people that it's not

00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:58.570
just you doing your craft for
10,000 hours and nothing else.

00:11:58.570 --> 00:12:01.240
There are steps to creativity.

00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:05.250
There's networking,
collaboration.

00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:06.880
Is a spark an idea?

00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:09.280
Is it just an idea?

00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:12.910
Is it worthy of throwing away?

00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:14.830
Once you have it,
do you leave it?

00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:15.820
How do you remix it?

00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:19.660
How do you find other
passions so that you

00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:21.970
can come back to it later?

00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:29.680
How do you not go overboard once
you fail for the first time,

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:32.130
or if you constantly
are failing?

00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:35.975
Dealing with failure is
a big part of creativity.

00:12:35.975 --> 00:12:37.350
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
Well, I think

00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:40.500
it also speaks a lot
to the relatability.

00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:43.020
And this is something you
mentioned with the how-to books

00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:46.060
being corny in a way.

00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:48.060
Recently, a lot of people
have been putting out

00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:49.200
books about meditation.

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:50.950
And you do mention
meditation in the book.

00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:52.320
But that's not really relevant.

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:54.330
But when you see
somebody like an Arianna

00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:57.030
Huffington or a Russell Simmons
come out and be like, oh yeah,

00:12:57.030 --> 00:12:59.100
you should take two
hours in the morning

00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:01.770
to cook yourself a nice
breakfast and meditate.

00:13:01.770 --> 00:13:04.290
I think if you're working
a 9:00-to-5:00 job and then

00:13:04.290 --> 00:13:06.632
hitting your second
job to make rent,

00:13:06.632 --> 00:13:09.090
you're looking at that and
being like, well, that's not me.

00:13:09.090 --> 00:13:10.670
I can't do that.

00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:13.560
AHMIR THOMPSON: Well,
I used to laugh at--

00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:15.550
who's the first person
put me onto that?

00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:24.850
In '95, our first major tour
was with the Beastie Boys.

00:13:24.850 --> 00:13:32.060
So by that point, the Beastie
Boys that I'd grown up on--

00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:35.690
'84 to '89 era--

00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:37.860
they were a whole new group.

00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:45.240
And I wasn't quite ready
for the kinder, gentler,

00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:46.860
all-understanding Beastie Boys.

00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:49.537
Like this is your first tour, so
you're thinking, like, yo, bro,

00:13:49.537 --> 00:13:50.370
it's gonna be crazy.

00:13:50.370 --> 00:13:51.553
Ooh, Beastie Boys!

00:13:51.553 --> 00:13:54.935
And you know, like, Ad-Rock
wants to play Scrabble.

00:13:54.935 --> 00:13:55.810
You know what I mean?

00:13:58.830 --> 00:13:59.760
Wait, Scrabble?

00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:01.430
Wait, where's the girls?

00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:04.110
And we were just confused.

00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:12.600
And probably the member that
had the biggest transformation

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:15.150
was Yauch, MCA.

00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:24.900
And he spoke in depth about
him meeting the Dalai Lama,

00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:27.750
and that changing his life, and
him getting into meditation,

00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:29.400
that sort of thing.

00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:33.480
And at the time when
you're 24, you're

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:35.370
just like viewing it from afar.

00:14:35.370 --> 00:14:38.110
But you're doing that--

00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:40.830
what's the movie reference
where the bullet's coming

00:14:40.830 --> 00:14:41.510
and you duck?

00:14:41.510 --> 00:14:42.300
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
A "Matrix" thing?

00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:44.299
AHMIR THOMPSON: Yeah,
sort of like "The Matrix."

00:14:44.299 --> 00:14:47.430
In my mind I'm just like, oh,
I'm not ready for that yet.

00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:50.720
Where the girls at?

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:56.190
And so where I explain that
it started to save my life--

00:14:56.190 --> 00:15:02.010
now I heard, during
the Obama campaign,

00:15:02.010 --> 00:15:12.390
both Russell and Deepak who were
on the Obama campaign in 2007--

00:15:12.390 --> 00:15:15.120
I heard them explain in great
detail about how meditation

00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:16.800
saves your life and
that sort of thing.

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:21.400
So I already knew about deep
breathing and all that stuff.

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:26.040
But then one day, I'll say that
it actually maybe sort of saved

00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:26.820
my life.

00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:33.240
So we were doing The
Roots picnic in New York

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:36.300
two years ago at Bryant Park.

00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:39.690
And the one thing I
know more than anything

00:15:39.690 --> 00:15:42.430
is that the show always goes on.

00:15:42.430 --> 00:15:47.910
And you have to be prepared
for plan C, D, E, F, G, H,

00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:49.340
whatever.

00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:54.810
And so I knew at the
beginning that there was maybe

00:15:54.810 --> 00:15:57.370
a risk in booking
certain artists,

00:15:57.370 --> 00:16:03.270
especially artists that
have punctuality problems.

00:16:05.394 --> 00:16:07.560
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: That's
a pretty diplomatic word.

00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:09.809
AHMIR THOMPSON: If they wait
a decade for their album,

00:16:09.809 --> 00:16:12.660
they might make you wait
maybe 75 minutes before they

00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:13.470
get on stage.

00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:15.390
And they don't understand.

00:16:15.390 --> 00:16:16.030
I'm an artist.

00:16:16.030 --> 00:16:18.240
But I'm also a "suit."

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:24.030
So I understand union house, and
union rules, and those things.

00:16:24.030 --> 00:16:29.070
And OK, at exactly 10:59, we
have to stop for a union break.

00:16:29.070 --> 00:16:32.370
So people look at me like, oh,
when did you turn into a suit?

00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:34.810
But it's like I
understand those things.

00:16:34.810 --> 00:16:40.260
And so my production
manager, who

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:42.240
I didn't see in my
peripheral view,

00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:45.960
because I tend to look to
the right side of the stage

00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:47.670
when I'm drumming--

00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:49.410
at the time, John
Mayer was on stage.

00:16:49.410 --> 00:16:53.130
And he did his last guitar solo.

00:16:53.130 --> 00:16:55.980
I told him, when you start
making the guitar face,

00:16:55.980 --> 00:17:01.050
then I know that you're in your
last 30 seconds of your solo.

00:17:01.050 --> 00:17:04.107
So Mayer's at the climax
of his blues solo.

00:17:04.107 --> 00:17:09.006
[IMITATES BLUES SOLO] OK, I
know he's about to run down.

00:17:09.006 --> 00:17:10.089
And Keith was right there.

00:17:10.089 --> 00:17:12.530
He's like, yo,
D'Angelo's not here yet.

00:17:12.530 --> 00:17:15.260
And he's going to be
another 25 minutes.

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:21.530
And just already, just
the way that the day was--

00:17:21.530 --> 00:17:24.380
I'm not just the
drummer of this band.

00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:25.369
I'm the traffic cop.

00:17:25.369 --> 00:17:28.339
So while this song
is playing, I'm

00:17:28.339 --> 00:17:32.000
busy in my mind thinking
about this transition,

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.237
that transition, what if
da, da, da doesn't show up.

00:17:34.237 --> 00:17:35.820
So I'm already
thinking to the future.

00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:38.000
But just the way
that he startled

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.740
me took me out of my zone.

00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:44.712
And then I talked
in my production mic

00:17:44.712 --> 00:17:45.920
that the audience can't hear.

00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:49.294
And I said John, can you
do another 24 bars, please?

00:17:49.294 --> 00:17:51.710
And he's looking at me like,
I just gave it my everything.

00:17:51.710 --> 00:17:57.242
I said, John, please, just
more face man, more face.

00:17:57.242 --> 00:17:59.450
Past face, you've got to
get on your knees and do it.

00:17:59.450 --> 00:18:00.329
So he started--

00:18:00.329 --> 00:18:02.120
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
Behind the head, maybe.

00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:04.950
AHMIR THOMPSON: Yeah, he started
doing all the cliche stuff.

00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:10.110
And I was just looking,
panicking, panicking,

00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:10.610
panicking.

00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:11.000
What do I do?

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:11.660
What do I do?

00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:13.010
Oh, there's Common.

00:18:13.010 --> 00:18:17.870
God, I knew with Common
that I could at least buy

00:18:17.870 --> 00:18:21.770
like two or three songs, which
could be maybe 10 minutes,

00:18:21.770 --> 00:18:23.790
that sort of thing.

00:18:23.790 --> 00:18:26.510
And then I realized
that none of the guys

00:18:26.510 --> 00:18:29.000
knew the material from
his last two albums.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.890
So it was a struggle.

00:18:31.890 --> 00:18:35.600
And then there's myself,
do something real quick.

00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:38.570
And normally with
Rahzel, as long

00:18:38.570 --> 00:18:40.550
as he's been a
member of The Roots

00:18:40.550 --> 00:18:42.517
or whatever, it's
more like, OK, dude,

00:18:42.517 --> 00:18:43.600
we get the point, get out.

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:45.662
But he did a two-minute set.

00:18:45.662 --> 00:18:46.870
I'm like, what are you doing?

00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:48.571
Do more.

00:18:48.571 --> 00:18:49.820
And he's, I don't got nothing.

00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:55.520
And it was just the
stress and the stress.

00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:58.550
And then suddenly, I felt--

00:18:58.550 --> 00:18:59.990
[HEART RHYTHM]

00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:01.940
And I felt that.

00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:07.540
And I was like, oh shit, this
is going to be that moment.

00:19:07.540 --> 00:19:09.430
Something is about to happen.

00:19:09.430 --> 00:19:16.930
And because I never felt that
panic in my heart area before,

00:19:16.930 --> 00:19:22.920
and I was just like,
all right, be still.

00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:25.180
Be still.

00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:27.750
And at that moment,
Chappelle happened

00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:30.600
to be at the left of the stage.

00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:33.750
He hates when I put
him on the spot.

00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:37.920
But I just slowly looked
down, brought him over.

00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:40.970
I said, you're never
going to understand this.

00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:44.870
But I need you to talk for
like 15 minutes, please.

00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:49.340
And the seriousness that
I had in my eye, he just--

00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:51.017
OK, so he went out.

00:19:51.017 --> 00:19:52.850
That way, I didn't have
to drum or anything.

00:19:52.850 --> 00:19:57.010
And the panic kept coming.

00:19:57.010 --> 00:19:59.044
And I mean, I hate to say this--

00:19:59.044 --> 00:20:00.710
and I didn't put this
part in the book--

00:20:00.710 --> 00:20:05.860
but the real motivation was
like, I was like, oh God,

00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:07.330
I think I'm about to die.

00:20:07.330 --> 00:20:10.362
But I know it--

00:20:10.362 --> 00:20:12.320
aw, damn, this is the
part where I have a heart

00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:14.150
attack at my own festival.

00:20:14.150 --> 00:20:17.411
And even worse, that's going
to be on my Wikipedia page

00:20:17.411 --> 00:20:17.910
forever.

00:20:21.610 --> 00:20:23.420
And all I kept thinking about--

00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:28.210
I mean, that's like how
narcissistic we are right now.

00:20:28.210 --> 00:20:32.180
I saw that entry on
my Wikipedia page.

00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:35.360
And no matter how
you try to erase it--

00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:38.570
I tried once to erase
a fact that was untrue.

00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:40.520
They keep saying that
my grandfather was

00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:43.220
a member of The Dixie
Hummingbirds, Beachy

00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:44.760
Thompson, which he's not.

00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:45.720
And I will erase this.

00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:47.150
And somebody will
put it right back.

00:20:47.150 --> 00:20:47.800
And I'll erase it.

00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:48.830
And they'll put it right--

00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:50.996
So I was like, I can't erase
this off the Wikipedia.

00:20:50.996 --> 00:20:54.380
So I was, "Thompson
had a cardiac arrest

00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:56.360
at his own festival."

00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:59.840
And then that's the part where
you just negotiate with God.

00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:01.799
And you're just like,
Lord, if you please just

00:21:01.799 --> 00:21:04.340
get me through this, I promise
you I'll do whatever you want,

00:21:04.340 --> 00:21:06.350
da-da da-da dah, da-da dah.

00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:08.850
And I remember what
Russell said about panic

00:21:08.850 --> 00:21:09.930
and that sort of thing.

00:21:09.930 --> 00:21:11.971
So I was like, OK, let me
do this breathing thing

00:21:11.971 --> 00:21:12.764
that they said.

00:21:12.764 --> 00:21:19.100
[GASPING] And suddenly, I
came back down to Earth.

00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:22.990
But I knew at that moment that--

00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:24.970
that moment
transformed me forever.

00:21:24.970 --> 00:21:32.170
And now, meditation
is part of my ideal--

00:21:32.170 --> 00:21:33.340
I see how it works.

00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:37.210
Because I'm a person that
just eats up panic, and just

00:21:37.210 --> 00:21:42.154
internalizes it, and doesn't
know how to let it go.

00:21:42.154 --> 00:21:44.320
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: But you
expand a little bit more

00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:46.870
about the concept of
this micro-meditation.

00:21:46.870 --> 00:21:48.190
That wasn't a full--

00:21:48.190 --> 00:21:51.190
you don't have to sit
there and ding a bowl

00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:52.360
and have the candles lit.

00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:54.852
You can just take some
time to be with yourself.

00:21:54.852 --> 00:21:57.310
AHMIR THOMPSON: Well, the way
that I applied it to the book

00:21:57.310 --> 00:21:57.970
is also--

00:21:57.970 --> 00:22:04.860
I mean, under the
micro-meditation umbrella is--

00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:10.210
I mean, I simply say that
we forgot how to get bored.

00:22:10.210 --> 00:22:16.720
And boredom and creativity
are sort of hand in hand.

00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:22.240
And oftentimes
when we are bored,

00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:25.900
our default move
is to grab this.

00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:29.290
And we entertain ourselves,
which is kind of weird for me

00:22:29.290 --> 00:22:32.160
to say at Google, sorry.

00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:42.020
But oftentimes, the best ideas
come to you when you're silent

00:22:42.020 --> 00:22:47.670
and when you're just in
a serene, calm place.

00:22:47.670 --> 00:22:53.040
And I don't know if we do
that in this day and age.

00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:58.860
And as a result, I feel
like a lot of the ideas that

00:22:58.860 --> 00:23:01.750
are sort of out there in
the world of entertainment

00:23:01.750 --> 00:23:03.640
are disposable.

00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:05.370
I mean, I don't
care if something

00:23:05.370 --> 00:23:07.500
has a billion streams.

00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:11.520
It's like, will it
stand the test of time?

00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:17.800
Whereas a guy like
Prince, who purposely

00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:23.220
stayed in Minnesota in
isolation away from distraction,

00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:24.940
away from New York or LA--

00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:28.180
the distractions that
can trap you there--

00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:30.070
to create some of his best work.

00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:33.410
I mean, I believe that
boredom and silence

00:23:33.410 --> 00:23:37.065
is the key ingredient.

00:23:37.065 --> 00:23:39.190
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: That
leads me to something else

00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:41.150
that I really wanted to
speak with you about,

00:23:41.150 --> 00:23:44.890
which is what I have encountered
personally and also seen

00:23:44.890 --> 00:23:47.200
in a lot of other
creative people--

00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:52.240
the two biggest enemies or
obstacles that a lot of them

00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:56.890
face, which is distraction
and discouragement.

00:23:56.890 --> 00:23:59.560
These sort of things can
just stop a creative venture

00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:00.500
in its tracks.

00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:02.900
So I'm wondering if you can
speak more about how you'd

00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:07.300
navigate both distraction in a
world filled with distraction,

00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:10.180
but also the discouragement
that comes with not getting

00:24:10.180 --> 00:24:14.830
that immediate tactile,
or, I don't have 25 likes

00:24:14.830 --> 00:24:17.670
after five minutes,
something is wrong here.

00:24:17.670 --> 00:24:19.725
AHMIR THOMPSON: Yeah,
I speak on how--

00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:24.220
especially because
a lot of my work

00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:27.730
requires that I
go on the internet

00:24:27.730 --> 00:24:32.860
to do research as
a DJ, there are

00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:35.440
about six or seven
reliable blogs

00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:38.860
that I look to, to see who's
coming up around the corner

00:24:38.860 --> 00:24:40.920
that I should be up on
before this DJ gets to--

00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:44.760
or that sort of thing,
or the SoundCloud rapper

00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:49.502
of the moment sort of thing.

00:24:49.502 --> 00:24:56.010
So oftentimes, I often find
myself, as soon as I log on,

00:24:56.010 --> 00:24:57.660
I'll do that work
for 10 minutes.

00:24:57.660 --> 00:25:01.980
And then oh, there's a
peacock, that sort of thing.

00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:03.870
Or someone sends a cat video.

00:25:03.870 --> 00:25:04.930
And then you're--

00:25:04.930 --> 00:25:06.721
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: It
gets you every time.

00:25:06.721 --> 00:25:10.350
AHMIR THOMPSON: Yeah, you're
falling down a rabbit hole.

00:25:10.350 --> 00:25:13.590
So I mean, the beauty
of the internet

00:25:13.590 --> 00:25:18.210
is that there is an open
world of information

00:25:18.210 --> 00:25:19.800
for you to eat up.

00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:25.350
But the hard part is to
stay in that tunnel lane

00:25:25.350 --> 00:25:31.200
and concentrate on the task at
hand and not distract yourself.

00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:38.530
And oftentimes, that happens
to me in my distraction.

00:25:38.530 --> 00:25:45.560
As far as discouragement
is concerned,

00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:52.517
I'm slow to give not needless,
but meaningless advice.

00:25:52.517 --> 00:25:54.850
I don't want to be that guy
that's like, yeah, just hang

00:25:54.850 --> 00:25:57.470
in there, and follow your
dreams, and that sort of thing.

00:25:57.470 --> 00:26:02.410
Because I tell
people all the time,

00:26:02.410 --> 00:26:09.490
coming into this industry the
way I did through hip-hop--

00:26:09.490 --> 00:26:13.450
I mean, hip-hop culture,
especially early '90s, mid-90's

00:26:13.450 --> 00:26:18.070
hip-hop culture is
made of pipe dreams.

00:26:18.070 --> 00:26:19.960
Everyone imagines--
my manager says

00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:22.900
that one of the greatest things
to ever happen to The Roots

00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:27.820
was the fact that we never
had a Bentley moment.

00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:33.010
And that Bentley moment is this
imagined idea of celebration

00:26:33.010 --> 00:26:35.860
where you're in a
Hype Williams video

00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:44.650
fantasy with slow-motion money
and champagne, the slow motion

00:26:44.650 --> 00:26:48.190
strip club fantasy that every
rapper dreams of being in.

00:26:48.190 --> 00:26:52.600
And that was never
our narrative.

00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:54.370
But then again, there's
nothing romantic

00:26:54.370 --> 00:26:59.730
about a blue-collar musician,
like a working musician.

00:26:59.730 --> 00:27:02.260
In the age of narrative,
of winners-- hey,

00:27:02.260 --> 00:27:04.839
I won, I made it, I escaped.

00:27:04.839 --> 00:27:05.380
I'm a winner.

00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:06.460
I'm a winner.

00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:09.680
That was the narrative
of '97 and beyond.

00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:10.720
I'm a winner.

00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:12.670
And you're not.

00:27:12.670 --> 00:27:16.450
Pre-'97, it was more like--

00:27:16.450 --> 00:27:18.250
I mean, Run DMC
said "My Adidas."

00:27:18.250 --> 00:27:20.080
And then their audience
was like, oh, we

00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:21.760
can have that, too.

00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:23.920
It was never like,
these are my Adidas

00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:25.000
and you can't have those.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:28.180
But after '97, this is my yacht.

00:27:28.180 --> 00:27:29.530
This is my condo.

00:27:29.530 --> 00:27:30.460
And you can't have it.

00:27:30.460 --> 00:27:32.560
This is my Benz, my Bentley.

00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:33.650
And you can't have it.

00:27:33.650 --> 00:27:37.570
So it's kind of weird that
we built heroes out of people

00:27:37.570 --> 00:27:40.200
that were also cutting us
off at the velvet rope.

00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:47.620
So because we didn't
have that, maybe it

00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:52.650
kept us humble by default.
Not thinking we wanted it,

00:27:52.650 --> 00:27:56.460
but I also feel as though,
if we got it at that moment,

00:27:56.460 --> 00:28:00.090
we probably would
have fallen apart.

00:28:00.090 --> 00:28:04.640
Last week, I interviewed
producer Salaam Remi

00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:09.750
on my Pandora podcast.

00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:15.720
And he was a big part of
the success of The Fugees.

00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:17.220
And I asked him--

00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:19.350
OK, so when "The
Score" came out,

00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:23.180
their second album, selling 17
million units across the world

00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:26.310
after their first album tanked--

00:28:26.310 --> 00:28:31.380
I asked him, I
said, do you regret

00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:35.820
that album selling so much
and having that much success

00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:38.280
at such a fast time period?

00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:39.990
I mean, of course,
Lauryn followed it up

00:28:39.990 --> 00:28:41.260
with her solo record.

00:28:41.260 --> 00:28:49.170
But if you were
back in 1996 seeing

00:28:49.170 --> 00:28:54.540
what would happen to the group
individually 20 years from now,

00:28:54.540 --> 00:28:59.310
would you regret being
part of the process

00:28:59.310 --> 00:29:02.819
or helping that process
along of selling 16 million?

00:29:02.819 --> 00:29:04.110
He didn't give me a direct yes.

00:29:04.110 --> 00:29:07.737
But he definitely said
that maybe if they just did

00:29:07.737 --> 00:29:09.570
half that or just did
something normal like,

00:29:09.570 --> 00:29:14.100
hey, you went platinum, then
he would have probably opted

00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:16.200
for that, the long
run as opposed

00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:20.310
to the instantaneous
just-add-water success that

00:29:20.310 --> 00:29:23.787
leads to diminished returns.

00:29:23.787 --> 00:29:25.620
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: You
touched on something

00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:26.995
that really struck
with me there,

00:29:26.995 --> 00:29:29.890
which was you used
the comment escape.

00:29:29.890 --> 00:29:31.510
And I think a lot
of creative people

00:29:31.510 --> 00:29:33.931
are out there looking
for books like this.

00:29:33.931 --> 00:29:35.430
And they're looking
for that doorway

00:29:35.430 --> 00:29:38.400
to escape wherever they
are, whatever they're in,

00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:40.770
especially, like you said,
those people on the outside

00:29:40.770 --> 00:29:42.550
of that velvet rope.

00:29:42.550 --> 00:29:44.970
That carries a lot of weight
that you have a lot of people

00:29:44.970 --> 00:29:47.080
out there looking to
escape who they are,

00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:49.770
escape their current situation,
escape their current life.

00:29:49.770 --> 00:29:51.900
And maybe that's
not the best path

00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:54.910
to truly find who you can
be and find your creativity.

00:29:54.910 --> 00:29:56.451
AHMIR THOMPSON: I
mean, sometimes you

00:29:56.451 --> 00:29:58.150
need to walk away.

00:29:58.150 --> 00:30:03.030
I can admit now in hindsight
that my first manager, who

00:30:03.030 --> 00:30:06.060
was the father figure
of The Roots-- his name

00:30:06.060 --> 00:30:07.890
is Richard Nichols.

00:30:07.890 --> 00:30:11.290
I wrote-- my very first
book, "Mo' Meta Blues,"

00:30:11.290 --> 00:30:15.840
was really a collaboration
between Richard and I.

00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:21.330
I told my publisher that I
felt the tone of the book

00:30:21.330 --> 00:30:24.480
should be my morning
ritual, which

00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:29.250
was basically Rich calls
you at some ungodly hour,

00:30:29.250 --> 00:30:30.330
at 6:00 in the morning.

00:30:30.330 --> 00:30:35.340
But he wants to
discuss astrophysics.

00:30:35.340 --> 00:30:39.620
Who wants to talk
that at 6:00 AM?

00:30:39.620 --> 00:30:44.580
But his Mensa level
of intelligence

00:30:44.580 --> 00:30:48.060
just wore off on all of us.

00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:55.110
And usually talking
on the phone or mostly

00:30:55.110 --> 00:30:58.170
chatting each other
on our computers

00:30:58.170 --> 00:31:01.890
are these full-blown
conversations that that's

00:31:01.890 --> 00:31:03.280
what I wanted in my book.

00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:08.510
And so after he passed away,
after my first book came out,

00:31:08.510 --> 00:31:12.660
I'll say that as a
group we were all frozen

00:31:12.660 --> 00:31:15.450
and not outright
admitting that we

00:31:15.450 --> 00:31:17.340
were free to do anything
else as The Roots

00:31:17.340 --> 00:31:19.680
because he wasn't there
in the driver's seat

00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:24.720
to be our guiding light.

00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:29.310
But this is the longest that
we've taken between albums.

00:31:29.310 --> 00:31:34.470
And for me, I mean, I
knew that eventually I'd

00:31:34.470 --> 00:31:38.550
have to step up, and
man up, and create

00:31:38.550 --> 00:31:40.870
this next album without him.

00:31:40.870 --> 00:31:43.200
But I guess my
first steps in doing

00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:44.790
that was walking away from it.

00:31:44.790 --> 00:31:48.870
So that's where suddenly
people are like, wait,

00:31:48.870 --> 00:31:50.601
why are you writing
books about food?

00:31:50.601 --> 00:31:51.600
Where's the next record?

00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:53.130
Oh, I'll get to it.

00:31:53.130 --> 00:31:55.235
And wait, "Hamilton"?

00:31:55.235 --> 00:31:56.795
What the hell?

00:31:56.795 --> 00:31:57.920
No, I'm going to get to it.

00:31:57.920 --> 00:31:58.878
I'm going to get to it.

00:31:58.878 --> 00:32:03.210
And I kept finding distractions
and other projects to work on.

00:32:03.210 --> 00:32:05.880
But really, I just
needed to feel

00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:08.280
more confident in sitting
in the driver's seat

00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:12.980
and starting this album, which,
I mean, we're at stage three

00:32:12.980 --> 00:32:13.480
now.

00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:17.430
So it'll be out around the
third quarter, like September,

00:32:17.430 --> 00:32:18.810
October.

00:32:18.810 --> 00:32:24.420
But yeah, sometimes you do
have to walk away and escape

00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:32.317
your current situation just
to return and love it again.

00:32:32.317 --> 00:32:34.900
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: We do want
to leave some time for Googlers

00:32:34.900 --> 00:32:35.608
to ask questions.

00:32:35.608 --> 00:32:38.490
So if you want to make your way
to microphones, we can do that.

00:32:38.490 --> 00:32:41.610
And as they do, I
wanted to jump back

00:32:41.610 --> 00:32:43.300
on something else
you talked about,

00:32:43.300 --> 00:32:46.680
which was the sidekick position
that you often fear yourself

00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:48.360
in.

00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:51.360
You talk a lot in the beginning
of the book about consuming

00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:54.920
creativity and being an avid
viewer and an avid watcher

00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:56.460
and listener.

00:32:56.460 --> 00:32:59.940
Talk about why you think that
is so important for somebody who

00:32:59.940 --> 00:33:02.910
is a creative person or wants to
be more creative in their life,

00:33:02.910 --> 00:33:07.132
to consume instead of just make.

00:33:07.132 --> 00:33:08.340
AHMIR THOMPSON: I don't know.

00:33:08.340 --> 00:33:11.597
I mean, I don't even know
if it's that interesting.

00:33:11.597 --> 00:33:12.555
Because half the time--

00:33:16.140 --> 00:33:18.500
OK, a perfect example.

00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:21.290
So my girlfriend
has zero interest

00:33:21.290 --> 00:33:25.190
in John Coltrane solos.

00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:29.840
So I'm trying to
explain to her that he's

00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:31.370
using a different
chord structure

00:33:31.370 --> 00:33:39.110
than the average disciple
of either Duke Ellington--

00:33:39.110 --> 00:33:43.780
or he's using Middle
Eastern chords here.

00:33:43.780 --> 00:33:47.150
And she's just like, oh, OK.

00:33:47.150 --> 00:33:50.490
She's so disaffected and
uninterested in those things.

00:33:50.490 --> 00:33:53.130
But I don't know.

00:33:53.130 --> 00:33:57.766
I just am more interested
in those people

00:33:57.766 --> 00:34:00.140
that when they were kids they
would take stuff apart just

00:34:00.140 --> 00:34:02.610
to see the machinery.

00:34:02.610 --> 00:34:09.730
I mean, this is why the
Rube Goldberg device-machine

00:34:09.730 --> 00:34:10.670
is the cover of it.

00:34:10.670 --> 00:34:16.190
Because when I was a kid, there
was one at the Philadelphia

00:34:16.190 --> 00:34:20.210
airport that I used to just
always sit and watch long

00:34:20.210 --> 00:34:22.400
after our flight has landed.

00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:25.572
I mean, I just love the
machinery of it all.

00:34:25.572 --> 00:34:27.530
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: The
deconstruction process?

00:34:27.530 --> 00:34:29.405
AHMIR THOMPSON: Yeah,
and the building of it.

00:34:31.179 --> 00:34:34.630
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
Let's start on this side.

00:34:34.630 --> 00:34:35.764
AUDIENCE: Hi there.

00:34:35.764 --> 00:34:38.139
AHMIR THOMPSON: Wait, where's
that spotlight coming from?

00:34:38.139 --> 00:34:40.380
AUDIENCE: It's from heaven.

00:34:40.380 --> 00:34:42.409
I'm Henry.

00:34:42.409 --> 00:34:43.659
I'm Google's medical director.

00:34:43.659 --> 00:34:45.800
Please, don't have a heart
attack while you're here.

00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:47.091
AHMIR THOMPSON: No, we're good.

00:34:47.091 --> 00:34:48.790
AUDIENCE: Sorry,
all right, cool.

00:34:48.790 --> 00:34:50.820
I had a question about
late night in general.

00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:52.695
And this might not be
a comfortable question.

00:34:52.695 --> 00:34:54.429
But I mean, you look
at Jimmy Fallon.

00:34:54.429 --> 00:34:58.030
You look at the rest of
the late night stars.

00:34:58.030 --> 00:34:59.650
Other than Conan,
no one's black.

00:34:59.650 --> 00:35:02.220
Well, maybe Trevor Noah
over at Comedy Central.

00:35:02.220 --> 00:35:05.560
And not since Arsenio or,
I guess, Larry Wilmore,

00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:09.550
have we seen these folks
that even middle America can

00:35:09.550 --> 00:35:11.980
see every night as role models.

00:35:11.980 --> 00:35:14.290
How do you guys think about
that behind the scenes?

00:35:14.290 --> 00:35:16.674
This is an awesome
responsibility, but maybe not.

00:35:16.674 --> 00:35:18.340
Maybe you're just
trying to get everyone

00:35:18.340 --> 00:35:21.130
to laugh themselves to sleep
because it's all messed up.

00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:28.740
AHMIR THOMPSON:
I think initially

00:35:28.740 --> 00:35:30.500
late night
entertainment, was sought

00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:33.630
as just frothy entertainment.

00:35:33.630 --> 00:35:36.110
People only watch the
first five minutes.

00:35:36.110 --> 00:35:39.360
And now in the age of
the internet, usually

00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:43.500
people wake up and look at the
highlights on their computers.

00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:48.240
I'm actually more
concerned about the culture

00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:49.870
behind the scenes.

00:35:49.870 --> 00:35:55.700
I mean oftentimes, the face of--

00:35:55.700 --> 00:35:58.830
Michael Jackson at one point
was the number one entertainer

00:35:58.830 --> 00:35:59.820
in the world.

00:35:59.820 --> 00:36:02.459
And Michael Jordan was the
number one basketball player

00:36:02.459 --> 00:36:03.000
in the world.

00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:11.110
But I want people in the
position of the people

00:36:11.110 --> 00:36:16.630
that signed Michael Jordan's
checks to look like that.

00:36:16.630 --> 00:36:19.210
That's a major concern.

00:36:19.210 --> 00:36:22.700
I know that a lot of
people are confused about--

00:36:22.700 --> 00:36:27.610
who just won Best Actress
for "Three Billboards?"

00:36:27.610 --> 00:36:28.324
What's her name?

00:36:28.324 --> 00:36:29.490
AUDIENCE: Frances McDormand.

00:36:29.490 --> 00:36:31.630
AHMIR THOMPSON: Yeah,
Frances McDormand.

00:36:31.630 --> 00:36:35.440
Her last words at the
Oscars, she said two words,

00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:37.240
"inclusion clause."

00:36:37.240 --> 00:36:39.910
And that's very real.

00:36:39.910 --> 00:36:45.610
Even where I work, that's
extremely, extremely real.

00:36:45.610 --> 00:36:53.120
So without getting
super deep into it,

00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:57.230
I'm using all of
the power I'm given

00:36:57.230 --> 00:37:01.100
and overstepping my
bounds, if you will,

00:37:01.100 --> 00:37:06.050
to change the face
of that, to make sure

00:37:06.050 --> 00:37:12.790
that more women, more people of
color are in intern positions.

00:37:12.790 --> 00:37:14.620
Because that's where it starts.

00:37:14.620 --> 00:37:17.560
Because usually an intern
at places like that,

00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:20.674
it's nepotism rules.

00:37:20.674 --> 00:37:22.340
The guy getting you
coffee, and then you

00:37:22.340 --> 00:37:25.460
realize suddenly that, oh
my God, your father is who?

00:37:25.460 --> 00:37:28.560
That sort of thing.

00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:33.920
But I know what you're saying.

00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:37.970
But for me, the main
problem is what's

00:37:37.970 --> 00:37:41.090
in the boardroom, what's
in the writers' room.

00:37:41.090 --> 00:37:43.610
That's my concern.

00:37:43.610 --> 00:37:45.516
And I'm working on it.

00:37:45.516 --> 00:37:47.856
[APPLAUSE]

00:37:50.845 --> 00:37:52.220
AUDIENCE: So you've
done so much,

00:37:52.220 --> 00:37:54.650
so many different career
moves and projects.

00:37:54.650 --> 00:37:56.870
What do you want that
Wikipedia page to say?

00:37:59.700 --> 00:38:02.666
AHMIR THOMPSON: OK,
I'm not the guy that--

00:38:02.666 --> 00:38:03.810
AUDIENCE: Not literally.

00:38:03.810 --> 00:38:05.380
What do you want
to be known for?

00:38:05.380 --> 00:38:07.620
What do you want
that highlight to be?

00:38:07.620 --> 00:38:11.850
AHMIR THOMPSON: I once
made a joke about--

00:38:11.850 --> 00:38:14.760
I used to obsess over
my Metacritic score,

00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:19.837
which, back when I was
only making records,

00:38:19.837 --> 00:38:21.420
I was waking up every
day to make sure

00:38:21.420 --> 00:38:22.920
that we were like 80 and above.

00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:27.870
Because we weren't
selling mega millions.

00:38:27.870 --> 00:38:30.210
So to me, it was like the
critical acclaim of the group

00:38:30.210 --> 00:38:33.827
was our staying
power from the label

00:38:33.827 --> 00:38:35.910
of dropping us or pressing
that guillotine button.

00:38:39.090 --> 00:38:41.040
I don't know what it says now.

00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:44.910
I know that I don't want Beachy
Thompson to be falsely named

00:38:44.910 --> 00:38:47.800
as my grandfather.

00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:52.246
So if someone here at Google
can fix that, I'll be fine.

00:38:52.246 --> 00:38:56.110
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: Let's
jump back to this side.

00:38:56.110 --> 00:38:58.380
AUDIENCE: Hey, my
name is [? Nivos. ?]

00:38:58.380 --> 00:39:00.730
I'm an upcoming DJ
and a music producer.

00:39:00.730 --> 00:39:01.210
AHMIR THOMPSON: How you doing?

00:39:01.210 --> 00:39:01.793
AUDIENCE: Hey.

00:39:06.340 --> 00:39:09.600
And I found that a lot of
times that I work on my stuff,

00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:13.455
I always think I have in
my back of my head, what

00:39:13.455 --> 00:39:15.270
are these guys going
to think of my stuff?

00:39:15.270 --> 00:39:16.644
Or, is this guy
that I appreciate

00:39:16.644 --> 00:39:18.340
going to like it or not?

00:39:18.340 --> 00:39:21.360
I was wondering if you have a
tip how to stay neutral to this

00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:23.520
and stay loyal to what
you actually like or want

00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:25.740
to represent.

00:39:25.740 --> 00:39:27.430
AHMIR THOMPSON: As
far as your craft,

00:39:27.430 --> 00:39:29.967
DJing and your music production?

00:39:29.967 --> 00:39:32.070
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:39:32.070 --> 00:39:34.920
AHMIR THOMPSON: That's a
really, really good question.

00:39:34.920 --> 00:39:44.720
Because of all my jobs,
that's the one job where

00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:49.510
I guess you have to
adhere to that cliche,

00:39:49.510 --> 00:39:51.850
the customer is always right.

00:39:51.850 --> 00:39:53.600
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
[INAUDIBLE] mechanism.

00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:59.000
AHMIR THOMPSON:
Yeah, I'm a guy that

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:02.740
has made it known of
my snobbery of music.

00:40:02.740 --> 00:40:04.400
And not in that
way, I don't want

00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:06.179
to be the condescending
guy that--

00:40:06.179 --> 00:40:07.970
well, yes, I have this
version of this song

00:40:07.970 --> 00:40:10.470
and you don't,
that sort of thing.

00:40:10.470 --> 00:40:13.400
But then I became
a DJ and noticed

00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:15.320
that my personal taste--

00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:17.750
I was that guy on the
internet that says, oh man,

00:40:17.750 --> 00:40:19.340
that song's bad,
that song's good.

00:40:19.340 --> 00:40:23.390
And then I realized that, I
mean, not just subjective,

00:40:23.390 --> 00:40:25.980
but I don't think bad
and good exist anymore.

00:40:25.980 --> 00:40:27.920
It's almost like
what's effective

00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:31.100
and what's not effective.

00:40:31.100 --> 00:40:34.700
I'll say the day, maybe four
days after "Bodak Yellow" came

00:40:34.700 --> 00:40:38.990
out, I was resistant because
I was the grumpy old guy that

00:40:38.990 --> 00:40:40.060
was just like, what?

00:40:40.060 --> 00:40:41.920
That chick from
"Love and Hip Hop"?

00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:43.400
Yeah, whatever.

00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:49.760
And then I heard it
in the right context.

00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:55.130
And then I saw myself
slowly falling for it.

00:40:55.130 --> 00:40:57.575
I actually had to have a
meeting with my group members.

00:40:57.575 --> 00:41:02.290
I was like, yo, are we--

00:41:02.290 --> 00:41:09.400
because I'm also very leery
about middle-class black people

00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:13.860
that will gravitate
towards ratchet culture

00:41:13.860 --> 00:41:15.770
to show that they're still down.

00:41:15.770 --> 00:41:18.640
But no, no, no, I
understand that mentality.

00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:23.800
Because sometimes, if you're
in a culture in which you're

00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:30.340
alone, you have to identify
and hang on to your blackness

00:41:30.340 --> 00:41:31.540
no matter what cost.

00:41:31.540 --> 00:41:37.240
And oftentimes, I would see
lone music critics, like the one

00:41:37.240 --> 00:41:42.180
black guy at "New York
Times" that would rake us

00:41:42.180 --> 00:41:45.840
over the coals because
we weren't Plies,

00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:49.590
or we weren't Gucci Mane,
you know what I mean?

00:41:49.590 --> 00:41:51.810
Blacker than black,
as if there's

00:41:51.810 --> 00:41:53.380
degrees to showing
your blackness

00:41:53.380 --> 00:41:56.770
is more than you have to show.

00:41:56.770 --> 00:42:03.270
So I will say that I didn't
know if I was being Stockholm

00:42:03.270 --> 00:42:05.340
Syndrome or not,
or if I was going

00:42:05.340 --> 00:42:09.490
through a mid-life crisis, or
if I just genuinely started

00:42:09.490 --> 00:42:12.810
to like "Bodak Yellow"
against my will, which

00:42:12.810 --> 00:42:15.120
I would hope it was the latter.

00:42:15.120 --> 00:42:18.466
I hear it, I can't
stop doing this.

00:42:18.466 --> 00:42:19.590
And everybody's doing that.

00:42:19.590 --> 00:42:22.080
And it's like,
oh, OK, I like it.

00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:26.010
So it's so hard
being a creative,

00:42:26.010 --> 00:42:31.350
having your own personal
taste, but then there's

00:42:31.350 --> 00:42:35.820
the effective taste of your
audience, and they're clashing.

00:42:35.820 --> 00:42:38.340
So I don't know.

00:42:38.340 --> 00:42:40.530
I think, at the end of the
day, stick to your guns.

00:42:40.530 --> 00:42:44.280
And you have to develop
a lot of patience.

00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:47.130
Because I don't know if
your brand of creativity

00:42:47.130 --> 00:42:49.350
is more in line of
what the marketplace is

00:42:49.350 --> 00:42:52.440
or if you're against it.

00:42:52.440 --> 00:42:54.530
Like I would be the guy--

00:42:54.530 --> 00:42:58.620
damn, am I going to
say this right now?

00:42:58.620 --> 00:43:04.410
We were experimenting with
a trap song in an odd meter,

00:43:04.410 --> 00:43:06.720
like in 7/8 meter.

00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:08.220
So it feels like
it texture-wise,

00:43:08.220 --> 00:43:09.430
but it's totally undanceable.

00:43:09.430 --> 00:43:12.460
So it's almost jazz-like.

00:43:12.460 --> 00:43:15.150
But it's almost like,
why would I do that?

00:43:15.150 --> 00:43:17.430
Wouldn't the smart money
bees like to create something

00:43:17.430 --> 00:43:19.840
that the masses would like?

00:43:19.840 --> 00:43:22.860
So again, it's my personal
taste versus what's effective

00:43:22.860 --> 00:43:24.870
and what's not effective.

00:43:24.870 --> 00:43:26.490
That's always going to clash.

00:43:26.490 --> 00:43:29.250
So I think, at the
end of the day,

00:43:29.250 --> 00:43:34.880
just educate yourself,
absorb everything,

00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:40.310
leave nothing out, but stick
to what your heart says.

00:43:40.310 --> 00:43:42.040
There's no real right
or wrong answer.

00:43:42.040 --> 00:43:44.060
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: Well, then
there's two audiences, right?

00:43:44.060 --> 00:43:46.040
You have your audience,
who are fans of what

00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:47.992
you've done your entire career.

00:43:47.992 --> 00:43:49.700
Then you have market
audience, which is--

00:43:49.700 --> 00:43:51.080
AHMIR THOMPSON: See, but
I can't even trust that.

00:43:51.080 --> 00:43:53.550
Because there are people
that expect that of me now.

00:43:53.550 --> 00:43:59.380
Like when I DJ
now, they expect me

00:43:59.380 --> 00:44:03.040
to play Tribe and
Mos Def and whatever

00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:04.912
was hitting 20 years ago.

00:44:04.912 --> 00:44:06.370
And I'm not that
DJ that just wants

00:44:06.370 --> 00:44:09.520
to prove to you that
I may or may not

00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:11.920
be 50 in a couple of years.

00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:15.382
So here's that new 21 Savage.

00:44:15.382 --> 00:44:16.840
I don't want to be
that guy either.

00:44:19.660 --> 00:44:21.760
I thought the answer--

00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:24.790
oh God, I'm about to tell you
all the story of my worst fail.

00:44:24.790 --> 00:44:27.589
This is the fail story in here.

00:44:27.589 --> 00:44:29.630
I'll try and tell it in
the fastest way possible.

00:44:29.630 --> 00:44:34.566
But my presentation DJing was--

00:44:34.566 --> 00:44:37.190
I said, what I'm going to do is
I'm going to include all music.

00:44:37.190 --> 00:44:39.770
Because the thing is,
I'm not anti-commercial

00:44:39.770 --> 00:44:41.870
or pro-underground or
any of those things

00:44:41.870 --> 00:44:46.220
that people expect the
left of center of music

00:44:46.220 --> 00:44:48.570
to be, which is I guess
that's what we represent,

00:44:48.570 --> 00:44:52.480
the alt-hip-hop, left of
center, thinking man's hip-hop,

00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:56.480
or whatever The Roots are
supposed to represent.

00:44:56.480 --> 00:45:00.320
I always wanted a clear
balance, like a world

00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:07.390
where Cardi B and maybe
Phoebe Snow could exist,

00:45:07.390 --> 00:45:11.810
a world where Mary J. Blige
and Billie Holiday could exist.

00:45:11.810 --> 00:45:14.970
And I was going to find
the spots in between.

00:45:14.970 --> 00:45:19.132
So when I do a four-hour
set, the oldest song I play

00:45:19.132 --> 00:45:23.300
is from 1938, which is Benny
Goodman's "Sing, Sing, Sing."

00:45:23.300 --> 00:45:26.090
And the newest song
I'll play is whatever

00:45:26.090 --> 00:45:27.310
just came out last week.

00:45:27.310 --> 00:45:31.370
I'll try to figure out how to
fit all those spots in between

00:45:31.370 --> 00:45:33.860
and travel through each
decade from Louis Jordan,

00:45:33.860 --> 00:45:35.390
to Miles Davis,
to Fleetwood Mac,

00:45:35.390 --> 00:45:39.560
to Drake, to A Tribe Called
Quest, to James Brown,

00:45:39.560 --> 00:45:42.350
to James Taylor,
and figure out how

00:45:42.350 --> 00:45:45.710
to pack it in so that you don't
know I'm trying to educate you.

00:45:45.710 --> 00:45:56.110
And so early 2016, I did the
last week, or the last party,

00:45:56.110 --> 00:45:59.140
of the Obamas at
the White House.

00:45:59.140 --> 00:46:01.720
And of course, I knew instantly.

00:46:01.720 --> 00:46:04.900
I planned this thing
out like I was John Nash

00:46:04.900 --> 00:46:08.650
or whatever that math problem
was in "Good Will Hunting."

00:46:08.650 --> 00:46:10.615
I had my math formulas all out.

00:46:10.615 --> 00:46:12.490
This song is going to
modulate with this song

00:46:12.490 --> 00:46:14.560
and mix with that song
and that perfect segue

00:46:14.560 --> 00:46:17.250
in this key and that
key and this BPM.

00:46:17.250 --> 00:46:19.450
And I had the
perfect six-hour mix.

00:46:19.450 --> 00:46:22.750
I tested it on the
"Hamilton" after-party.

00:46:22.750 --> 00:46:25.660
And they had me on
their shoulders.

00:46:25.660 --> 00:46:28.690
I could of ran for president.

00:46:28.690 --> 00:46:36.130
And an hour into my mix,
man, things fell apart.

00:46:36.130 --> 00:46:44.360
Tap on the shoulder, hey,
you're doing a good job.

00:46:44.360 --> 00:46:47.500
But they want to dance, too.

00:46:47.500 --> 00:46:49.570
And of course, his
daughters are just like--

00:46:52.160 --> 00:46:54.760
all sitting on the
floor protesting.

00:46:54.760 --> 00:46:55.900
All the adults are dancing.

00:46:55.900 --> 00:46:59.730
But all the kids that
are there are just like--

00:46:59.730 --> 00:47:02.260
even Rihanna was
too old for them.

00:47:02.260 --> 00:47:05.800
And I was thrown off my game.

00:47:05.800 --> 00:47:09.640
No one had ever resisted the
all-knowledgeable Questlove

00:47:09.640 --> 00:47:12.550
and his music selections.

00:47:12.550 --> 00:47:16.540
So then I became
the guy I hated.

00:47:16.540 --> 00:47:23.465
So I pulled out my phone,
saw what the teenagers liked.

00:47:23.465 --> 00:47:26.320
I was looking on Tidal,
looking on Google.

00:47:26.320 --> 00:47:31.290
I was looking on every streaming
service, the top 10 songs.

00:47:31.290 --> 00:47:35.680
I typed in at one point, what
is swag surfing, all this stuff.

00:47:35.680 --> 00:47:43.190
And it was my meltdown moment.

00:47:43.190 --> 00:47:45.545
I was just like, I failed.

00:47:48.260 --> 00:47:50.060
It was the worst
night of my life.

00:47:50.060 --> 00:47:54.324
And I almost-- well
yeah, I cried a little.

00:47:54.324 --> 00:47:55.490
I didn't want him to see it.

00:47:55.490 --> 00:47:57.406
So at the end of the
night, he was like, yeah.

00:47:57.406 --> 00:47:59.270
So we had the time--
because the thing was,

00:47:59.270 --> 00:48:00.510
once I started playing--

00:48:00.510 --> 00:48:04.730
first of all, I don't want to be
the DJ that plays ratchet shit

00:48:04.730 --> 00:48:05.900
at the White House.

00:48:09.930 --> 00:48:11.180
I'm in the Hall of Presidents.

00:48:11.180 --> 00:48:16.020
And Taft and Washington
are looking at me like--

00:48:16.020 --> 00:48:18.814
and plus, I had the
explicit versions.

00:48:18.814 --> 00:48:21.230
And I'm like, yo, I don't want
to play this French Montana

00:48:21.230 --> 00:48:21.729
song.

00:48:21.729 --> 00:48:26.104
And he's like, yeah,
play what they want.

00:48:26.104 --> 00:48:27.770
And he brings like
Chance and ASAP Rocky

00:48:27.770 --> 00:48:31.119
on stage telling
me, play this song.

00:48:31.119 --> 00:48:31.910
And I'm playing it.

00:48:31.910 --> 00:48:36.110
And then it turned
into "Animal House."

00:48:36.110 --> 00:48:38.600
People were slam
dancing and everything.

00:48:38.600 --> 00:48:39.990
They had the time
of their lives.

00:48:39.990 --> 00:48:41.906
And I'm just looking
like, who are you people?

00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:47.700
I never thought in my
life I'd see such--

00:48:47.700 --> 00:48:48.980
it was the most ratchet--

00:48:48.980 --> 00:48:50.240
and I've seen stuff.

00:48:50.240 --> 00:48:54.860
It was the most ratchet party
of all time, almost to the point

00:48:54.860 --> 00:48:58.230
where I felt like, by the
fourth hour, I was like,

00:48:58.230 --> 00:49:02.690
OK, this is a rebellion against
the incoming administration.

00:49:02.690 --> 00:49:04.100
That's what this is.

00:49:04.100 --> 00:49:09.290
And at the end of the night,
arms rolled up, tie off

00:49:09.290 --> 00:49:13.070
and everything, this
was the greatest--

00:49:13.070 --> 00:49:14.700
he was proud.

00:49:14.700 --> 00:49:16.580
Yo, this is the greatest
party in my life.

00:49:16.580 --> 00:49:18.830
It was great-- you
should be proud.

00:49:18.830 --> 00:49:20.599
It was amazing, and da-da dah.

00:49:20.599 --> 00:49:21.640
Did you have a good time?

00:49:21.640 --> 00:49:24.050
I was like, you
know, it was cool.

00:49:24.050 --> 00:49:26.580
And he was like, well, why not?

00:49:26.580 --> 00:49:27.440
And he looked at me.

00:49:27.440 --> 00:49:28.250
And he knew.

00:49:28.250 --> 00:49:31.200
And he was like, oh, I get it.

00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:32.180
You're an artist.

00:49:32.180 --> 00:49:38.000
And you came in here
with your agenda.

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:40.074
You came here with
your agenda and you

00:49:40.074 --> 00:49:41.490
knew you were going
to wow us with

00:49:41.490 --> 00:49:46.550
your massive musical knowledge
of disco, and pop, and Motown,

00:49:46.550 --> 00:49:47.510
and da-da dah.

00:49:47.510 --> 00:49:51.620
He says, but you did
something more noble.

00:49:55.878 --> 00:49:58.280
He said, you served the people.

00:49:58.280 --> 00:50:00.156
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:00.156 --> 00:50:02.501
[APPLAUSE]

00:50:04.846 --> 00:50:07.060
He said, I've been
in this situation

00:50:07.060 --> 00:50:11.500
where I thought I
knew what was best.

00:50:11.500 --> 00:50:13.630
And sometimes, you just
got to look at the people.

00:50:13.630 --> 00:50:15.670
And you've got to
serve the people.

00:50:15.670 --> 00:50:17.922
And you should be proud.

00:50:17.922 --> 00:50:20.130
So I started feeling like,
yeah, I served the people.

00:50:20.130 --> 00:50:21.906
And he's like, yeah.

00:50:21.906 --> 00:50:24.361
You should be proud.

00:50:24.361 --> 00:50:26.485
Trust me, that was the
greatest night of our lives.

00:50:26.485 --> 00:50:27.485
And thank you very much.

00:50:27.485 --> 00:50:29.790
So you feel better?

00:50:29.790 --> 00:50:32.665
No.

00:50:32.665 --> 00:50:34.300
So I got over it.

00:50:34.300 --> 00:50:36.410
I retired for four months
and then I came back.

00:50:36.410 --> 00:50:38.770
Sorry for that
long-winded answer.

00:50:38.770 --> 00:50:40.690
I guess I'm saying
serve the people.

00:50:40.690 --> 00:50:41.620
AUDIENCE: Great
story, thank you.

00:50:41.620 --> 00:50:42.306
AHMIR THOMPSON: You're welcome.

00:50:42.306 --> 00:50:43.180
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
Unfortunately--

00:50:43.180 --> 00:50:44.250
AHMIR THOMPSON:
Wait, wait, please.

00:50:44.250 --> 00:50:44.749
Wait.

00:50:44.749 --> 00:50:46.172
Just give me a new suit.

00:50:46.172 --> 00:50:46.590
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
Unfortunately, we

00:50:46.590 --> 00:50:48.630
are running low, so we'll
take one more from each side,

00:50:48.630 --> 00:50:48.980
please.

00:50:48.980 --> 00:50:49.930
AUDIENCE: OK, thanks.

00:50:49.930 --> 00:50:50.800
Hi my name is Jana.

00:50:50.800 --> 00:50:51.984
Thank you for being here.

00:50:51.984 --> 00:50:54.650
Thanks for "Talks at" for having
a hip-hop conversation at 10:00

00:50:54.650 --> 00:50:55.530
AM on a Wednesday.

00:50:55.530 --> 00:50:56.800
I love that.

00:50:56.800 --> 00:51:00.520
My first concert actually was
Roots, Lauryn Hill, Outkast

00:51:00.520 --> 00:51:03.171
in Maryland with my
mom in middle school.

00:51:03.171 --> 00:51:04.712
AHMIR THOMPSON: I
remember that show.

00:51:04.712 --> 00:51:05.969
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:51:05.969 --> 00:51:08.260
I remember it, too, because
I learned what weed smelled

00:51:08.260 --> 00:51:10.580
like with my mom in a mosh pit.

00:51:10.580 --> 00:51:12.810
And because you all were great.

00:51:12.810 --> 00:51:15.430
So my question is around
impostor syndrome.

00:51:15.430 --> 00:51:17.980
It was really interesting
to hear you, of all people,

00:51:17.980 --> 00:51:21.640
say that you feel like not
necessarily a creative,

00:51:21.640 --> 00:51:24.239
but like a bystander,
a lucky participant.

00:51:24.239 --> 00:51:25.780
We talk a lot about
impostor syndrome

00:51:25.780 --> 00:51:28.025
at Google, about
self-doubt, and feeling

00:51:28.025 --> 00:51:29.150
like you don't belong here.

00:51:29.150 --> 00:51:31.300
And I actually work with
university students,

00:51:31.300 --> 00:51:32.650
particularly HBCU students.

00:51:32.650 --> 00:51:35.260
So I have a lot of talks
about impostor syndrome

00:51:35.260 --> 00:51:37.330
and knowing that you
belong in this place,

00:51:37.330 --> 00:51:39.970
even if you don't see a lot
of people who look like you.

00:51:39.970 --> 00:51:41.200
And so I'm just curious.

00:51:41.200 --> 00:51:43.644
I'm always giving them
examples about people,

00:51:43.644 --> 00:51:46.060
like real people, who they
know of who go through impostor

00:51:46.060 --> 00:51:47.740
syndrome and what they do.

00:51:47.740 --> 00:51:50.500
So I know it's kind
of like a term,

00:51:50.500 --> 00:51:52.150
but when you have
that self-doubt, what

00:51:52.150 --> 00:51:53.108
are some things you do?

00:51:53.108 --> 00:51:56.240
I'd love to be able to
tell my students about it.

00:51:56.240 --> 00:51:58.280
AHMIR THOMPSON: Yeah, I
go through that a lot,

00:51:58.280 --> 00:52:07.440
only because I feel as though
maybe with black artists

00:52:07.440 --> 00:52:10.400
we'll allow this
winner-take-all narrative.

00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:14.610
And like, Joni
Mitchell didn't have

00:52:14.610 --> 00:52:16.780
to shake her ass in no video
and that sort of thing.

00:52:16.780 --> 00:52:20.580
And she doesn't sell Michael
Jackson's "Thriller" numbers.

00:52:20.580 --> 00:52:23.370
But she's still the
legendary Joni Mitchell.

00:52:23.370 --> 00:52:30.120
But there's rarely
an idea of a prestige

00:52:30.120 --> 00:52:33.300
artist for black people.

00:52:33.300 --> 00:52:39.840
And oftentimes, because we
were never selling that winner

00:52:39.840 --> 00:52:41.580
narrative, we made it.

00:52:41.580 --> 00:52:43.470
Again, this whole,
"we made it, aha,

00:52:43.470 --> 00:52:46.860
I made it and you didn't"--

00:52:46.860 --> 00:52:54.180
because we didn't sell
that, oftentimes, you

00:52:54.180 --> 00:52:58.730
can internalize that
"I'm not a winner" thing,

00:52:58.730 --> 00:53:06.590
which I don't necessarily
recommend that for your--

00:53:06.590 --> 00:53:09.200
I think we did it just
to protect our feelings,

00:53:09.200 --> 00:53:11.192
the disappointment.

00:53:11.192 --> 00:53:13.150
And there were moments
where we threw tantrums.

00:53:13.150 --> 00:53:15.840
And, why are they on Rolling
Stone's cover and not us?

00:53:15.840 --> 00:53:17.180
That sort of thing.

00:53:17.180 --> 00:53:21.120
But I wouldn't trade it
for anything in the world.

00:53:21.120 --> 00:53:27.840
Because at least for us, this
"tortoise and the hare" journey

00:53:27.840 --> 00:53:31.950
that we've taken has
us here, which again,

00:53:31.950 --> 00:53:34.395
if it were any other
way, we wouldn't be here.

00:53:37.740 --> 00:53:40.950
So I think it's up
to the individual.

00:53:40.950 --> 00:53:43.620
But it's also the
networking of it all.

00:53:43.620 --> 00:53:45.240
I know especially
in this environment,

00:53:45.240 --> 00:53:47.929
you might be the lone person
in your department or whatever.

00:53:47.929 --> 00:53:48.470
I don't know.

00:53:51.590 --> 00:53:53.900
I recommend
gathering your flock.

00:53:53.900 --> 00:53:58.790
That's what we did, the idea
of that parenthesis in 1997.

00:53:58.790 --> 00:54:01.850
We realized, oh, we're people
who are just like we are.

00:54:01.850 --> 00:54:04.010
Oh, Jill Scott, oh--

00:54:04.010 --> 00:54:06.800
we organized and
gathered our flock.

00:54:06.800 --> 00:54:12.080
So sometimes, maybe you have
to organize your flock just

00:54:12.080 --> 00:54:15.447
to know that you're OK
and that you're not alone.

00:54:15.447 --> 00:54:16.280
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:54:16.280 --> 00:54:17.845
AHMIR THOMPSON: I hope
that was a good answer.

00:54:17.845 --> 00:54:19.803
AUDIENCE: Hey, I wanted
to ask a quick question

00:54:19.803 --> 00:54:20.947
about creativity.

00:54:20.947 --> 00:54:22.280
Well, my question will be quick.

00:54:22.280 --> 00:54:24.650
But I hope your answer is long.

00:54:24.650 --> 00:54:27.110
So you mentioned Coltrane.

00:54:27.110 --> 00:54:29.330
And I would say Coltrane's
probably best known

00:54:29.330 --> 00:54:34.010
for the Coltrane changes, a
musical device that parted ways

00:54:34.010 --> 00:54:37.580
with the direction
of jazz at the time.

00:54:37.580 --> 00:54:39.890
And I was wondering,
how do you think

00:54:39.890 --> 00:54:45.440
about breaking the
frameworks that you've

00:54:45.440 --> 00:54:49.490
learned in terms of
your musical knowledge

00:54:49.490 --> 00:54:50.690
in order to be original?

00:54:50.690 --> 00:54:53.940
You talked about different time
signatures, so on and so forth.

00:54:53.940 --> 00:54:56.060
But I always find
it very interesting

00:54:56.060 --> 00:55:01.190
the balance between the
way things should be done,

00:55:01.190 --> 00:55:03.020
and then how you
make your own sound.

00:55:03.020 --> 00:55:05.520
And I was wondering if you
could talk a little bit to that.

00:55:05.520 --> 00:55:08.780
AHMIR THOMPSON: I was one
of those musicians that

00:55:08.780 --> 00:55:14.680
saw breaking the envelope
or breaking the rules

00:55:14.680 --> 00:55:20.280
as a way of being original.

00:55:20.280 --> 00:55:25.380
But as of late, I see
more envelope pushers

00:55:25.380 --> 00:55:33.510
and rule breakers that are
on that end of the spectrum.

00:55:33.510 --> 00:55:35.180
But then once I look
under the surface,

00:55:35.180 --> 00:55:38.930
I realize that they
don't know the basics.

00:55:38.930 --> 00:55:41.840
So it's the equivalent of
if you were five years old

00:55:41.840 --> 00:55:47.280
and your parents decided
to start you in 11th grade.

00:55:47.280 --> 00:55:49.790
And then I find out that you
don't know basic addition

00:55:49.790 --> 00:55:52.250
and subtraction.

00:55:52.250 --> 00:55:54.650
So I mean, that's the
only scary thing about--

00:55:54.650 --> 00:56:01.820
I'm all for musical
metamorphosis

00:56:01.820 --> 00:56:05.820
coming from one place
and ending up another.

00:56:05.820 --> 00:56:13.980
But for me, when
I test musicians,

00:56:13.980 --> 00:56:16.290
I do the easiest thing
possible and that tells me

00:56:16.290 --> 00:56:18.390
a lot about them.

00:56:18.390 --> 00:56:21.240
So when I'm playing
with a new musician

00:56:21.240 --> 00:56:24.300
or I'm auditioning a
musician for a project,

00:56:24.300 --> 00:56:25.530
they're often shocked.

00:56:25.530 --> 00:56:28.980
Because they'll come there
with the most complex thing

00:56:28.980 --> 00:56:31.130
that's going to blow my
mind and all those things.

00:56:31.130 --> 00:56:33.007
And that turns me off so much.

00:56:33.007 --> 00:56:34.590
I don't know if it's
because of my age

00:56:34.590 --> 00:56:36.423
or because of the old
school-ness of it all.

00:56:36.423 --> 00:56:41.610
But you're completely naked
when you are simply told--

00:56:41.610 --> 00:56:44.970
sorry, I have a cold.

00:56:44.970 --> 00:56:47.640
You're completely
vulnerable when you're

00:56:47.640 --> 00:56:49.990
playing something simple.

00:56:49.990 --> 00:56:53.280
So if you're playing
"Mary Had a Little Lamb"

00:56:53.280 --> 00:56:58.200
and you can't simply
do those 10 notes, then

00:56:58.200 --> 00:57:00.210
that tells me a lot
about your personality,

00:57:00.210 --> 00:57:05.520
about you retaining
information, dictating

00:57:05.520 --> 00:57:09.510
back to what I said,
being a teammate,

00:57:09.510 --> 00:57:13.110
not standing out while the
rest of the musicians are.

00:57:13.110 --> 00:57:19.700
So I'm for coloring outside
the box and experimenting

00:57:19.700 --> 00:57:20.540
and those things.

00:57:20.540 --> 00:57:24.550
But to me, the mark
of a great musician

00:57:24.550 --> 00:57:28.890
is one that thoroughly
knows the basics

00:57:28.890 --> 00:57:33.010
and is fine with being a
team member and not just

00:57:33.010 --> 00:57:34.734
Kobe hogging the ball.

00:57:34.734 --> 00:57:36.150
AUDIENCE: But you
know the basics.

00:57:36.150 --> 00:57:41.180
But then how do you approach
coloring outside the box?

00:57:41.180 --> 00:57:45.460
AHMIR THOMPSON: You also
have to prepare for isolation

00:57:45.460 --> 00:57:47.220
and being alone.

00:57:47.220 --> 00:57:52.070
I'll say that, at the
beginning of working

00:57:52.070 --> 00:57:59.480
on D'Angelo's "Voodoo" and his
style of musicianship, which,

00:57:59.480 --> 00:58:04.930
once I met D'Angelo and
J Dilla the same year,

00:58:04.930 --> 00:58:10.130
their drunken, laid-back
style, I'm so afraid of that.

00:58:10.130 --> 00:58:13.430
Because I was
like, yo, musicians

00:58:13.430 --> 00:58:15.500
are going to blame this on me.

00:58:15.500 --> 00:58:18.890
They're going to say you play
like a drunken three-year-old.

00:58:18.890 --> 00:58:22.430
Why can't I play like the
way I established myself?

00:58:22.430 --> 00:58:25.610
And it was such a hard,
radical move to do.

00:58:25.610 --> 00:58:29.410
Now, it's like everyone does--

00:58:29.410 --> 00:58:31.870
Kaytranada lives by that code.

00:58:31.870 --> 00:58:35.050
Everyone lives by this
drunken style thing.

00:58:35.050 --> 00:58:40.230
But back in '97, it was like,
oh man, every drummer's going

00:58:40.230 --> 00:58:42.700
to laugh at me, every musician.

00:58:42.700 --> 00:58:46.274
We did a song with
Lenny Kravitz once.

00:58:46.274 --> 00:58:47.190
And he kept listening.

00:58:47.190 --> 00:58:52.600
He's like, yo, there's a
discrepancy in your drumming.

00:58:52.600 --> 00:58:53.670
I don't get it.

00:58:53.670 --> 00:58:55.320
It was such a hard
sell to people.

00:58:55.320 --> 00:58:57.180
And it wasn't until
"Voodoo" started

00:58:57.180 --> 00:59:00.090
to make sense two
years after the fact

00:59:00.090 --> 00:59:02.960
that people were just
like, oh, now we get it.

00:59:02.960 --> 00:59:03.840
Oh, that's cool.

00:59:03.840 --> 00:59:07.990
But you've got to prepare to--

00:59:07.990 --> 00:59:11.360
once you find new territory,
you've got to mark it.

00:59:11.360 --> 00:59:13.080
And you've got to
stick by it, not

00:59:13.080 --> 00:59:16.650
be passive aggressive and,
oh, OK, I'll go back to what--

00:59:16.650 --> 00:59:19.342
once you do it,
you've got to own it.

00:59:19.342 --> 00:59:20.050
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:59:20.050 --> 00:59:21.133
AHMIR THOMPSON: Thank you.

00:59:21.133 --> 00:59:22.122
[APPLAUSE]

00:59:22.122 --> 00:59:24.622
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: We really
appreciate you taking the time

00:59:24.622 --> 00:59:25.990
to come talk with us today.

00:59:25.990 --> 00:59:27.550
It's been an absolute pleasure.

00:59:27.550 --> 00:59:28.230
We hope you come back sometime.

00:59:28.230 --> 00:59:30.090
AHMIR THOMPSON: I hope
I didn't bore you guys.

00:59:30.090 --> 00:59:31.390
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: The book
is called "Creative Quest."

00:59:31.390 --> 00:59:33.139
You can pick it up in
the back of the room

00:59:33.139 --> 00:59:34.550
or wherever great
books are sold.

00:59:34.550 --> 00:59:35.460
Thank you so much.

00:59:35.460 --> 00:59:36.543
AHMIR THOMPSON: Thank you.

00:59:36.543 --> 00:59:37.955
[APPLAUSE, CHEERING]

00:59:37.955 --> 00:59:40.080
Where do I go?
