00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:07.200
Landscape with the Fall of Icarus is a large
painting from the 1560s that hangs in Belgium’s

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.860
largest museum, the Musée des Beaux Arts
– and is held to be a meticulous copy of

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:18.530
an original (now lost) work by the Flemish
artist Pieter Bruegel the Elder. It shows

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:24.630
a superficially bucolic scene: ships are taking
sail, a shepherd is tending to his flock,

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.650
distant cities look prosperous and ordered.
But in the bottom right hand corner of the

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:36.910
canvas, a tragedy is unfolding, all but unheeded.
Reckless Icarus, the legendary figure from

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:42.149
Classical mythology, is in the final stages
of one of the ancient world’s most famous

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.199
aeronautical disasters. Together with his
father Daedalus, the young man had made himself

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:52.820
a pair of wings, glued together with wax.
Daedalus had warned his son not to fly too

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.539
close to the sun in case its heat were to
melt the structure, but the impetuous boy

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:04.360
soared too high anyway and, in the painting,
has just tumbled down into the waves, to his

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.980
death. Icarus’s end is deliberately not
the central focus of the painting.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.940
The eye is drawn instead to
the glittering cities and smart ships in the

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.960
distance. As if to emphasise the point, the
ploughman at the centre of the painting references

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:27.230
a popular proverb: ‘No plough stops for
the dying man.’ This neglect of Icarus’s

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:32.960
tragedy is, at one level, terrifying and sad.
We read into it how little the world cares

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:39.280
about our own pains. And yet, from another
perspective, this neglect is deeply gratifying

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.600
and importantly redemptive. It is one of the
central sources of our unhappiness that we

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.740
spend so much of our lives fearing for our
reputations and wondering what others will

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.330
think of us when we fail – as we inevitably
will at points. The slightest change in our

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:00.510
image in the eyes of others can obsess us.
We lie awake at night wondering how we could

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:06.910
cope without the approval of people we don’t
even like very much. We surrender our freedom

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:13.999
to the verdicts of strangers. But the painter’s
stroke of consoling genius is, here, to show

00:02:13.999 --> 00:02:20.180
us how, when we really mess up, almost no
one will be looking or caring very much. The

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.650
farmer is too busy ploughing, the shepherd
is too taken up with thinking about the weather,

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:31.700
someone else is overwhelmingly intent on fishing.
Our tragedies don’t occupy society the way

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:37.530
we fear they will. A few people might notice
for a moment, then swiftly move on to the

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.269
next thing. We are at the centre of the galaxy
only in our own minds. Other people mostly

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:45.389
don’t care what happens to us or what we’ve
done. The world is still filled with humans

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:49.879
who haven’t heard of us and never will.
Those who might be angry or disappointed with

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:55.829
you now will have forgotten all about you
soon enough. Your disgrace will, in time,

00:02:55.829 --> 00:03:01.420
be subsumed within the larger amnesia of a
consolingly indifferent world. It isn’t

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:07.279
just Icarus who is being swallowed up and
obscured by the waves: some of the same obscurity

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.280
awaits our greatest errors and embarrassments.
