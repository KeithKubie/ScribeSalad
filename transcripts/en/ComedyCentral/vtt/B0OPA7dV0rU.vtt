[line trilling]

00:00:05.237 --> 00:00:08.307
[telephone rings]

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.043
Hello.

00:00:10.076 --> 00:00:13.780 align:end position:100%
Hello, may I please speak
with a Mr. Blownoff?

00:00:13.813 --> 00:00:16.449
(Anders)
This is he,
and you can call me Dick.

00:00:16.482 --> 00:00:18.618
(Adam)
Okay, Mr. Blownoff,

00:00:18.651 --> 00:00:22.522
I am telling--
I am talking to you today

00:00:22.555 --> 00:00:24.624
from my work,
TelAmeriCorp.

00:00:24.657 --> 00:00:27.460 align:end position:100%
Hey, are you sick
of unblended foods?

00:00:27.493 --> 00:00:29.729
'Cause it's--you know what?

00:00:29.762 --> 00:00:32.498
Never mind. I suck at my job.
And I suck at my life.

00:00:32.531 --> 00:00:34.333
- Good-bye forever.
- Hang on.

00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:35.635
Listen, son, I don't bite.

00:00:35.668 --> 00:00:37.303
What are you selling?

00:00:37.336 --> 00:00:39.305
Stupid freaking blenders.

00:00:39.338 --> 00:00:40.706
Well, I'll take five.

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.175
How 'bout that?

00:00:42.208 --> 00:00:43.810
That's cool.

00:00:43.843 --> 00:00:47.313
I mean, honestly,
if I'm being real with you,

00:00:47.346 --> 00:00:50.716
I wouldn't buy anything
from me, because one, I'm fat,

00:00:50.749 --> 00:00:53.820
two, I'm stupid, three,
I'm fat and stupid combined.

00:00:53.853 --> 00:00:56.155
(Anderson)
Listen,
you don't sound fat to me,

00:00:56.188 --> 00:00:57.824
maybe a little depressed, huh?

00:00:57.857 --> 00:00:59.292
And I've been there.

00:00:59.325 --> 00:01:01.060
- Really?
- You know what I did?

00:01:01.093 --> 00:01:04.363
I went on a booze cruise
with my friends,

00:01:04.396 --> 00:01:06.332
and I was totally cured.

00:01:06.365 --> 00:01:08.334
Anyway, blenders...

00:01:08.367 --> 00:01:09.802
Well, the blenders,

00:01:09.835 --> 00:01:11.604
actually, I take it back,
what I said earlier.

00:01:11.637 --> 00:01:13.573
They're pretty cool.
You can make juices.

00:01:13.606 --> 00:01:15.775 align:end position:100%
You can, like,
blend up a boot.

00:01:15.808 --> 00:01:17.677
That's how sharp this thing is.
That's how intense it is.

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.045
Oh, I actually have a boot here
right now.

00:01:19.078 --> 00:01:20.413
Boop.

00:01:20.446 --> 00:01:23.483
[imitating blender whirring]

00:01:23.516 --> 00:01:26.352
Oh, my gosh, the boot,
it's blending so well.

00:01:27.286 --> 00:01:28.788 align:start size:41% position:59%
That's funny.

00:01:28.821 --> 00:01:32.492
Well, looks like it'll
get to you Tuesday,

00:01:32.525 --> 00:01:35.595
and I just want to say
thank you.

00:01:35.628 --> 00:01:37.730
You are a great man,
Mr. Dick Blownoff.

00:01:37.763 --> 00:01:40.433
(Anders)
And you are a good
goddamned salesman.

00:01:42.368 --> 00:01:45.234
Okay, so I'm gonna go ahead
and put you down
