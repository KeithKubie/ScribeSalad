00:00:00.416 --> 00:00:01.433
- [Instructor] Although we tend to think

00:00:01.433 --> 00:00:05.563
about Christopher Columbus'
first voyage in 1492,

00:00:05.563 --> 00:00:09.297
transforming the history of the Americas,

00:00:09.297 --> 00:00:12.195
it actually transformed a
great deal more than that,

00:00:12.195 --> 00:00:14.164
and in this video I want to talk

00:00:14.164 --> 00:00:18.287
about the larger world historical process

00:00:18.287 --> 00:00:20.635
that Columbus' voyage opened up,

00:00:20.635 --> 00:00:23.212
that transformed not only the Americas,

00:00:23.212 --> 00:00:26.765
but also Europe and
Africa, and this was called

00:00:26.765 --> 00:00:28.948
the Columbian Exchange.

00:00:28.948 --> 00:00:31.478
So what was the Columbian Exchange?

00:00:31.478 --> 00:00:34.311
This was a process of transferring

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.233
plants,

00:00:41.062 --> 00:00:41.895
animals,

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:44.683
microbes

00:00:46.245 --> 00:00:47.078
and people

00:00:49.174 --> 00:00:52.286
across the Atlantic in both directions.

00:00:52.286 --> 00:00:54.542
And not just trading these goods,

00:00:54.542 --> 00:00:58.060
but transplanting them
from Europe and Africa

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:01.233
into the Americas and
the other way around.

00:01:01.233 --> 00:01:04.940
And some of these exchanges
of species were intentional,

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.857
like bringing new crops
to grow in environments

00:01:07.857 --> 00:01:09.672
that were suited to them, and some of them

00:01:09.672 --> 00:01:13.229
were unintentional, like
the microbes and pests,

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.304
which were like little
hitchhikers on the bodies

00:01:15.304 --> 00:01:18.682
and crops that Europeans
brought to the New World.

00:01:18.682 --> 00:01:22.349
And it had a tremendous
environmental affect

00:01:25.178 --> 00:01:27.345
that had real consequences

00:01:30.373 --> 00:01:34.087
for people on both sides of the Atlantic.

00:01:34.087 --> 00:01:36.980
So let's look a little bit
closer at some of the things

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:40.706
that were exchanged across the Atlantic

00:01:40.706 --> 00:01:43.590
after Columbus began the process

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.576
of bringing things from the
Old World to the New World,

00:01:47.576 --> 00:01:50.678
and from the New World to the Old World.

00:01:50.678 --> 00:01:54.379
So first let's take a
closer look at the plants.

00:01:54.379 --> 00:01:56.766
Now, Spain, much like Portugal, was hoping

00:01:56.766 --> 00:02:00.805
to use this tropical
landscape to grow cash crops.

00:02:00.805 --> 00:02:04.555
So Columbus brought with
him sugar and grapes

00:02:05.866 --> 00:02:09.673
for wine, and coffee, these were all crops

00:02:09.673 --> 00:02:12.770
that would fetch high prices in Europe.

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.937
It was so lucrative to
grow sugar in the Caribbean

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.505
that they didn't even
want to give up any space

00:02:20.505 --> 00:02:23.495
to grow food, they imported their food

00:02:23.495 --> 00:02:27.336
so that they could spend all
of their land growing sugar.

00:02:27.336 --> 00:02:30.338
The Europeans also brought New World crops

00:02:30.338 --> 00:02:32.562
back to the Old World,
and some of these it's

00:02:32.562 --> 00:02:36.257
almost impossible to
imagine a world before,

00:02:36.257 --> 00:02:39.605
for example, the tomato
had ever come to Europe.

00:02:39.605 --> 00:02:42.697
Can you imagine Italian
food with no tomato sauce?

00:02:42.697 --> 00:02:46.358
They also brought corn and potatoes

00:02:46.358 --> 00:02:49.858
and sweet potatoes and cassava, or manioc.

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.370
And what's important about
most of these crops is

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.370
that they're very calorically dense.

00:03:00.212 --> 00:03:03.129
So if you grew a field of potatoes,

00:03:05.562 --> 00:03:08.325
instead of a field of
wheat, which might be

00:03:08.325 --> 00:03:12.210
a typical crop grown in the
Old Word before contact,

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:15.460
you can feed three times as many people

00:03:16.356 --> 00:03:21.208
with a field of potatoes
than you can with wheat.

00:03:21.208 --> 00:03:23.031
So what does this cause?

00:03:23.031 --> 00:03:27.390
It causes a real increase
in population in Europe.

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:30.837
It also causes an increase
in population in Africa,

00:03:30.837 --> 00:03:34.667
where manioc is a crop
that was frequently grown

00:03:34.667 --> 00:03:37.163
and also very calorically dense.

00:03:37.163 --> 00:03:39.893
So New World foods
helped Europe and Africa

00:03:39.893 --> 00:03:42.344
increase their populations.

00:03:42.344 --> 00:03:44.137
So what about these animals?

00:03:44.137 --> 00:03:47.969
The Europeans brought cattle, sheep,

00:03:47.969 --> 00:03:52.136
pigs, and horses to the New
World, with mixed results.

00:03:53.707 --> 00:03:58.042
Horses, for example, were
a tremendous technology

00:03:58.042 --> 00:04:01.169
that was widely adopted throughout Mexico

00:04:01.169 --> 00:04:04.840
and the Native Americans
living in the Great Plains

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.262
of what is today the United States found

00:04:07.262 --> 00:04:10.230
that horses revolutionized
their ability to hunt.

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.930
So that was a great step up for them.

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:14.777
The pigs they brought over, however,

00:04:14.777 --> 00:04:18.219
weren't so great because
Europeans allowed the pigs

00:04:18.219 --> 00:04:22.069
to roam freely, which meant
that they ate everything,

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:25.242
including the Native Americans' crops,

00:04:25.242 --> 00:04:28.160
and they multiplied very quickly.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.098
So they became kind of
a pest in the New World.

00:04:32.098 --> 00:04:35.577
Probably the thing that
had the biggest affect

00:04:35.577 --> 00:04:39.310
in the Columbian Exchange was the transfer

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:42.560
of Old World diseases to the New World.

00:04:43.416 --> 00:04:46.583
With Europeans came smallpox, measles,

00:04:48.233 --> 00:04:51.345
whooping cough, and the Native Americans

00:04:51.345 --> 00:04:55.228
had very little immunity
to these diseases.

00:04:55.228 --> 00:04:58.228
It's estimated that within 100 years

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:03.242
of Columbus landing in Hispaniola,

00:05:04.167 --> 00:05:07.334
90% of all people who were living

00:05:09.156 --> 00:05:11.823
in the Americas died of disease.

00:05:15.355 --> 00:05:18.868
This is a demographic catastrophe

00:05:18.868 --> 00:05:21.751
the likes of which the
world has never seen

00:05:21.751 --> 00:05:23.084
before or since.

00:05:24.921 --> 00:05:27.961
And most of the Native
Americans who were affected

00:05:27.961 --> 00:05:31.680
by these diseases would never
have actually interacted

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:35.430
with a European, they
just had trade networks

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:40.484
that spread these diseases back and forth

00:05:40.484 --> 00:05:42.986
throughout the Americas.

00:05:42.986 --> 00:05:44.972
Now, you might be wondering, okay,

00:05:44.972 --> 00:05:48.642
so if the Native Americans
were being exposed

00:05:48.642 --> 00:05:51.849
to new diseases from the Europeans,

00:05:51.849 --> 00:05:53.991
weren't the Europeans also being exposed

00:05:53.991 --> 00:05:56.561
to new diseases from the Native Americans?

00:05:56.561 --> 00:05:59.991
Why didn't it have such
a strong impact on them?

00:05:59.991 --> 00:06:01.639
There are a couple of reasons for that.

00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:06.407
One is that there was a
greater population density

00:06:06.407 --> 00:06:10.358
in Europe and Africa,
there were more people

00:06:10.358 --> 00:06:14.249
and they lived closer together in cities.

00:06:14.249 --> 00:06:17.214
So this gave diseases
opportunities to bounce

00:06:17.214 --> 00:06:19.801
back and forth between people and evolve

00:06:19.801 --> 00:06:21.677
and become stronger.

00:06:21.677 --> 00:06:25.744
The other important thing
is that Europeans lived

00:06:25.744 --> 00:06:27.161
close to animals,

00:06:29.302 --> 00:06:32.726
and as we remember from
things like bird flu

00:06:32.726 --> 00:06:36.436
or swine flu, animals and
humans can pass diseases

00:06:36.436 --> 00:06:38.320
back and forth between each other,

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:40.650
and that makes those
diseases even stronger.

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:43.155
In comparison, Native
Americans didn't have much

00:06:43.155 --> 00:06:47.776
population density and they
only domesticated dogs.

00:06:47.776 --> 00:06:51.801
And dogs, unlike pigs, can't
pass that many diseases

00:06:51.801 --> 00:06:54.071
back and forth between humans.

00:06:54.071 --> 00:06:57.485
So Native Americans just
didn't have diseases

00:06:57.485 --> 00:07:00.315
that were as vicious as the diseases

00:07:00.315 --> 00:07:03.271
that had been passed from person to person

00:07:03.271 --> 00:07:07.345
for many thousands of
years in Europe and Africa.

00:07:07.345 --> 00:07:10.134
So this gets to the last aspect
of the Columbian Exchange,

00:07:10.134 --> 00:07:12.350
the exchange of people.

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:16.130
Very quickly after Europeans arrived,

00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:18.738
the Native American population suffered

00:07:18.738 --> 00:07:21.738
from tremendous outbreak of disease,

00:07:24.667 --> 00:07:28.084
which meant that although
the Europeans had hoped

00:07:28.084 --> 00:07:32.405
to enslave them and use
them as a labor force

00:07:32.405 --> 00:07:35.912
in these Caribbean plantations,
very few of them survived,

00:07:35.912 --> 00:07:39.584
which meant that the Europeans
needed another labor force.

00:07:39.584 --> 00:07:43.343
They found that labor source
on the West Coast of Africa,

00:07:43.343 --> 00:07:47.596
where there was a long
tradition of slave trading,

00:07:47.596 --> 00:07:51.783
and they brought enslaved
African people against their will

00:07:51.783 --> 00:07:56.120
across the Atlantic to
work in the Caribbean,

00:07:56.120 --> 00:08:00.407
so that very quickly a
majority of the population

00:08:00.407 --> 00:08:03.740
in the Caribbean was of African descent.

00:08:05.209 --> 00:08:08.222
Ironically, this population
explosion brought on

00:08:08.222 --> 00:08:12.240
by New World foods meant
that there were more people

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:15.614
in Africa who were possible
subjects to enslavement,

00:08:15.614 --> 00:08:18.846
and it helped them keep
their population numbers

00:08:18.846 --> 00:08:22.096
relatively steady despite the exodus of

00:08:22.943 --> 00:08:25.776
as many as 12 to 13 million people

00:08:27.454 --> 00:08:31.635
over the course of the years
between Columbus arriving

00:08:31.635 --> 00:08:33.552
and approximately 1800.

00:08:34.591 --> 00:08:37.972
Likewise, this population
explosion in Europe led

00:08:37.972 --> 00:08:40.555
to worries about overpopulation

00:08:42.268 --> 00:08:44.185
in the 1600s and 1700s.

00:08:46.447 --> 00:08:49.202
And what did the nations of Europe do?

00:08:49.202 --> 00:08:52.723
They began sending people
over to the colonies.

00:08:52.723 --> 00:08:55.447
So the contact and exchange initiated

00:08:55.447 --> 00:08:58.720
by Christopher Columbus when he connected

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:02.470
the Old World with the
New had a profound affect

00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:05.528
on the environment, not
just of the New World,

00:09:05.528 --> 00:09:07.524
but of the Old World as well.

00:09:07.524 --> 00:09:11.912
And this profound affect on
the whole benefited Europe,

00:09:11.912 --> 00:09:15.662
at the expense of the
Americas and of Africa.
