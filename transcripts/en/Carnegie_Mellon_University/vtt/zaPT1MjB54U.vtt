00:00:01.712 --> 00:00:05.135
It is my pleasure to
introduce Martha Pollack.

00:00:05.135 --> 00:00:10.001
Dr. Pollack is the 14th
president of Cornell University.

00:00:10.001 --> 00:00:13.565
As faculty at the University of Michigan,
Dr. Pollack and Dr.

00:00:13.565 --> 00:00:16.260
Jahanian forged a strong friendship.

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.190
I'm pretty sure that neither of them
imagined that they'd be here today as

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:22.880
president of two of the best
universities in the United States.

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.490
Their presidency's come at an important
time in history, when we're presented

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:30.810
with new opportunities and
challenges on a daily basis.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.510
Technology is moving
forward at an amazing pace.

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.920
It's impacting all areas of research,
transforming how we teach and

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.580
blending the lines between disciplines.

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.870
Doctors Jahanian and Pollack are the right
time of leader at the right time -

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.510
bold, innovative, forward thinking.

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.820
We need to make our institutions
a transformational part of this time.

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:59.280
Since becoming the president of
Cornell University about a year and

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.020
a half ago, Dr. Pollack has demonstrated
a strong commitment to sustaining and

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:08.320
enhancing Cornell's academic
distinction while enhancing equality,

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.190
diversity and inclusivity.

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:16.006
She is supporting the university's
expansion into New York City,

00:01:16.006 --> 00:01:21.677
where it has programs that range from
architecture to technology to medicine.

00:01:21.677 --> 00:01:25.130
Dr. Pollack came to Cornell University
from the University of Michigan,

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.370
where she was provost and executive
vice president for academic affairs.

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:34.109
Before her tenure at Michigan,
she actually served on the University of

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:37.697
Pittsburgh's faculty, so
welcome back to Pittsburgh.

00:01:37.697 --> 00:01:44.105
[LAUGH]
Dr. Pollack is renowned for

00:01:44.105 --> 00:01:47.700
her contributions in computer science and
artificial intelligence.

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.030
Her research focuses on automated
planning, temporal reasoning and

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.120
constraint satisfaction.

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:58.760
She has designed intelligent technology to
assist people with cognitive impairments

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.039
and their caregivers.

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:03.397
Dr. Pollack has also served as
president of the Association for

00:02:03.397 --> 00:02:05.898
the Advancement of
Artificial Intelligence

00:02:05.898 --> 00:02:08.368
and was a member of
the advisory committee for

00:02:08.368 --> 00:02:11.163
the National Science
Foundation's Computers and

00:02:11.163 --> 00:02:13.706
Information Science Engineering Division

00:02:13.706 --> 00:02:18.060
and a member of the Board of the Directors
of the Computing Research Association.

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.805
Please join me in welcoming Dr.
Martha Pollack.

00:02:21.805 --> 00:02:32.028
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:02:32.028 --> 00:02:35.025
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Rebecca,
good morning to all of you.

00:02:35.025 --> 00:02:39.630
I'm truly honored to be here today for the
inauguration of my colleague and friend,

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.590
Farnam Jahanian as the tenth president
of Carnegie Mellon University.

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.494
Most of you probably don't know this,
but there is an historical connection

00:02:48.494 --> 00:02:51.512
between Carnegie Mellon and
my own university, Cornell.

00:02:51.512 --> 00:02:58.250
Andrew Carnegie was one of Cornell's first
trustees, elected to that role in 1890.

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:03.440
Later, honoring his passion for music,
Carnegie donated to Cornell a magnificent

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:09.170
organ to celebrate the 80th birthday of
our first president, Andrew Dickson White.

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.790
Alas, the organ suffered an ignoble fate.

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:18.002
Its air intake, for some inexplicable
reason, was located in the men's bathroom.

00:03:18.002 --> 00:03:21.134
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And in 1935,

00:03:21.134 --> 00:03:25.390
there was a plumbing failure that
fill that room with water.

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:29.770
Unaware of this, the university organist
sat down at the instrument, and

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:33.594
according to the historical account,
blew a mighty crescendo,

00:03:33.594 --> 00:03:37.578
which filled the leather organ
pouches with water, ruining them.

00:03:37.578 --> 00:03:40.982
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Perhaps we'd have been even better off

00:03:40.982 --> 00:03:42.360
with a gift of bagpipes.

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.386
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Now,

00:03:44.386 --> 00:03:47.224
there is also a long time
connection between Farnam and me,

00:03:47.224 --> 00:03:50.560
although of course not as long
as between our universities.

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.833
As Rebecca said, Farnam and I met about
20 years ago when we were both faculty

00:03:54.833 --> 00:03:59.069
members in Computer Science and
Engineering at the University of Michigan.

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:03.540
I later became chair of CSE, and
Farnam succeeded me in that role.

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.520
Later, he became provost
here at Carnegie Mellon

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.650
a few years after I had
become provost at Michigan

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:13.485
and he started as interim president
here just a couple of months after I

00:04:13.485 --> 00:04:15.247
became Cornell's president.

00:04:15.247 --> 00:04:18.186
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:04:18.186 --> 00:04:26.389
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; But

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:29.852
I'm gonna take that couple of
months head start seriously and

00:04:29.852 --> 00:04:33.994
imagine that it gives me the right to
offer him some advice on leadership.

00:04:33.994 --> 00:04:38.932
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Specifically, I'd like to quote Hopper,

00:04:38.932 --> 00:04:43.862
the grasshopper in the animated
movie "A Bug's Life" who said this,

00:04:43.862 --> 00:04:48.379
[I] quote, "first rule of leadership,
everything is your fault."

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:51.220
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; I hate to tell you this Farnam, but

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:54.550
Hopper's right, especially when
you're the president of a university.

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:58.795
But really, having everything be
your fault is a fair trade-off for

00:04:58.795 --> 00:05:03.060
all that is wonderful about
being a university president.

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:08.170
It is, as I know Farnam appreciates,
a huge privilege to lead a university,

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:11.210
especially a great one
like Carnegie Mellon.

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:16.563
Universities are institutions that
are second-to-none in changing lives.

00:05:16.563 --> 00:05:18.948
We change the lives of our students.

00:05:18.948 --> 00:05:22.920
We change the lives of the communities
into which our students graduate

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:27.240
and we change the lives of all those
who are touched by the research and

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.900
the scholarship of our faculty.

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:34.870
Farnam, I can assure you, is the perfect
choice to lead Carnegie Mellon and

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:38.990
to ensure that it continues its proud
tradition of changing lives for

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:40.390
the better.

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:44.610
He has a range of experience that's
an extraordinary fit for this university.

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:48.910
Experience in academia, where he's
been a talented and dedicated teacher,

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:53.200
as well as a renowned researcher whose
discoveries have had broad impact.

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:54.850
Experience in industry,

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:59.308
where he founded a very successful
network security startup company.

00:05:59.308 --> 00:06:00.695
And experience in government,

00:06:00.695 --> 00:06:04.280
where he served in major roles at
the National Science Foundation,

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:06.590
the National Research
Council's Computer Science and

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:09.650
Telecommunications board, and more.

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:10.710
But beyond all that,

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:15.680
what I want you to know is that Farnam
also has a set of personal characteristics

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:19.940
that are in complete alignment
with Carnegie Mellon's culture.

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:22.600
He is a person of high
integrity who values and

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:26.950
exhibits creativity,
innovation and entrepreneurship.

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:29.790
He values and promotes mentorship and
the development of

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:34.670
leadership skills as essential to
preparing students for today's world.

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:38.065
He appreciates the importance of
a university supporting a breadth of

00:06:38.065 --> 00:06:39.910
intellectual inquiry.

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:42.070
But he also has a particular passion for

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:47.710
translational research that produces
results that directly benefit society.

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:50.480
He's focused on the ways in
which technology can enhance

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:55.189
all aspects of the university,
from teaching to research, to operations.

00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:57.470
A few years ago,

00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:02.050
when Alan G. Merten retired from
the presidency of George Mason University,

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:06.380
he said this, [I] quote,
"Do I like being a university president?

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:07.660
I don't know, but

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:11.850
I do know that I have loved being
George Mason University's president.

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:14.090
Some of my friends
are university presidents.

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:17.850
I wouldn't wanna be where they are and
they probably wouldn't wanna be here.

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:20.820
These jobs could look a lot a like,
but they are not."

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:22.218
End quote.

00:07:22.218 --> 00:07:26.925
Search committees look for university
presidents who fit their university, and

00:07:26.925 --> 00:07:31.510
I can't imagine Carnegie Mellon finding
someone who fits better than Farnam.

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:36.140
He will be a brilliant and inspired
leader for this wonderful university.

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:37.130
And who knows?

00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:39.668
He may even learn to play the bag pipes.

00:07:39.668 --> 00:07:48.864
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
