00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:02.930
Have you ever wanted to see inside of someone’s
brain?

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:10.549
Well science has a few ways of reading your
mind

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:12.419
hey guys Julia here for DNews.

00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:17.279
The brain is made up of more than 100 billion
neurons all connecting and firing, registering

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.769
information from the senses, forming memories,
and making you, well you.

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:23.130
But how do we know what’s going on in there?

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.880
Back in the day it took something horrific,
like an iron rod going through your skull,

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.560
for scientists to know what a part of the
brain did.

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.910
An iron rod went through Phineas Gage’s
temporal lobe in the mid 1800s, which forever

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:35.640
changed his personality.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.190
Which lead scientists to discover that the
temporal lobe might have something to do with

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:40.190
emotion.

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:41.920
Phrenology was BIG thing in the 1800s too.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.780
Since they really couldn’t see into a brain
without injuring a person, scientists believed

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.920
that the shape of your head related to traits.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.610
Like a protruded forehead might mean you’re
intelligent.

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.840
Phrases like “highbrow” and “lowbrow”
can trace their roots back to phrenology.

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.400
But in the centuries since, we’ve become
a little more advanced in the way we look

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.400
at the brain.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:05.260
When we talk about the brain here on DNews
we frequently mention MRI, or magnetic resonance

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.820
imaging technique, but what is it and how
the hell does it see into the brain?

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.920
Well the technique is sort of new, it’s
only been around for 20 years or so.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.450
Like the name suggests the machine is basically
a giant tube shaped magnet, basically as you

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.790
lie there, the machine aligns the hydrogen
atoms in your body!

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.270
These aligned atoms give off very faint signals.

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:28.120
The machine uses these signals to take images
of your insides in slices, kind of like slicing

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:29.170
a loaf of bread.

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.210
To see inside the brain, the machine takes
advantage of the differences in magnetic properties

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.520
between oxygen-rich and oxygen-poor blood.

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.530
Basically when neurons fire, they need energy,
they don’t store it themselves, so they

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.880
need a quick hit of energy from blood.

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.590
So this technique works on the idea that if
you see an increase in blood flow to an area

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.030
of the brain, there’s increased activity
there.

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.690
So scientists can see what part of the brain
is working during different tasks like talking

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:52.690
or seeing.

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:57.040
However, it works too slowly to capture the
changes in the brain that can happen in a

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.040
millisecond.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.850
NIRS, also measures blood flow.

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.960
Near Infrared spectroscopy shoots a beam of
light through the skull and measures how that

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.490
light changes on the way out.

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.060
The way it changes depends on how much blood
there is in a part of the brain.

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.109
But other techniques can measure electrical
activity in the brain.

00:02:12.109 --> 00:02:16.090
EEG measures this through up to 256 electrodes
placed on the scalp.

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.620
It’s an old technique, some form of the
EEG has been around for over 80 years.

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.950
As neurons fire they give off electrical signals,
which are picked up by the electrodes.

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.469
This way researchers can measure quick changes
in the brain that can happen in the blink

00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:29.469
of an eye.

00:02:29.469 --> 00:02:33.620
While MRI’s are used more often these days,
EEG’s are still used to diagnose conditions

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:34.620
like epilepsy.

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.069
MEG is kind of a mix of both.

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:40.959
It detects the magnetic fields created by
electrical firing in the brain.

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:44.739
Basically when the brain’s neurons fire
in a certain pattern, it creates small magnetic

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:46.319
fields detected by SQUIDS.

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:47.659
No, not actual squids.

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:50.849
I mean a superconducting quantum interference
device.

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:54.120
But both of these measure activity at the
surface of the brain.

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.639
The best we have for deep brain imaging for
now is fMRI, or Functional magnetic resonance

00:02:58.639 --> 00:02:59.639
imaging.

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:03.239
And in the past five years thousands of studies
depend on the technique to discover things

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:07.249
like where emotions are registered in the
brain and diagnosing mental illnesses.

00:03:07.249 --> 00:03:08.629
WHICH IS SO COOL.

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:13.280
As neuroscientist Richard Frackowiak puts
it, fMRI has paved the way for turning psychology

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.620
“into a biological science.”

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:35.089
Who knows what the future will hold?
