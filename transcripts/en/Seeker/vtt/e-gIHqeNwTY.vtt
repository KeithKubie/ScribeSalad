00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.020
You know what’s the worst part about being
a kind of adult?

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:09.170
Besides making your doctor’s appointments?

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:11.830
COMMUTING.

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:13.570
Hey Guys Julia here for DNews

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:18.769
Over 85% of Americans commute to work by car
according to a report from the American Association

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:21.400
of State Highway and Transportation Officials.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.529
And this kind of commuting sucks.

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:24.880
Trust me on this.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.630
Some people try to justify it by saying they
like saving money to buy a bigger house or

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.180
that they love the alone time by listening
to podcasts.

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.460
But the truth is, we’re all just lying to
ourselves.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.829
One of the reasons car commuting sucks is
because it can make you sick.

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.960
A study published in the American Journal
of Preventive Medicine found that those who

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.880
drove themselves to work more were more likely
to have heart problems, weight problems and

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.140
that those with a commute over 10 miles had
higher blood pressure.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.870
A survey from Gallup found that those who
commuted for 90 minutes or more suffered from

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.329
neck and back problems.

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:56.710
Basically the more time you sit in a car,
that’s less time to work out, so of course

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:58.329
you’re gonna be a little worse for wear.

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:02.790
Not only can commuting by car make you sick,
it might make you more likely to get divorced.

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:06.860
One Swedish study found that those who take
at least 45 minutes to get to work are 40

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.580
percent more likely to get divorced.

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.590
Basically the more you travel in the mornings
you’re just more miserable.

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.380
A study published in World Leisure Journal
found that travel time is linked to feelings

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.880
of time crunch, which can increase stress
levels.

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.220
But why does it make you so miserable?

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.250
Well mostly it's just being alone.

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.720
Robert Putnam, a Harvard political scientist,
told the New Yorker “There’s a simple

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.880
rule of thumb: Every ten minutes of commuting
results in ten per cent fewer social connections.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.490
Commuting is connected to social isolation,
which causes unhappiness.”

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:35.700
But despair not!

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:36.700
There is hope.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.010
A study published in the Journal of Economic
Perspectives found that commuting becomes

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:42.430
a lot better if you’ve got a buddy in the
passenger seat.

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.640
The researchers asked participants to rank
how they spent their leisure time.

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.990
Not surprisingly sex got the top spot while
commuting hit the bottom of the list.

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.080
But if they spent that time with somebody
by carpooling, commuting got a bit of a boost

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.910
and ranked pretty similarly to other activities
like napping or watching tv.

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:02.640
Plus, just saying you get to use that carpool
lane, which cuts down on traffic and makes

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.050
the roads a little less stressful for everyone.

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:08.220
Not to mention by sharing a ride you can cut
down on pollution.

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.210
For every car taken off the road by carpooling,
it can save over 12,000 pounds of CO2 PER

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:14.210
DAY.

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:18.490
So if you want enjoy your commute a little
more and make the world a better place, consider

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:19.490
carpooling.

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:22.470
Even if you don’t have a buddy next to you,
some states, like California still let you

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.610
drive the carpool lane if you’ve got a fuel
efficient vehicle, which helps everybody by

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.380
cutting down on traffic and emissions.

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:29.550
What’s your commute like?

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:30.550
Do you read?

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:31.550
Listen to podcasts?

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:32.640
Catch up on Game of Thrones?
