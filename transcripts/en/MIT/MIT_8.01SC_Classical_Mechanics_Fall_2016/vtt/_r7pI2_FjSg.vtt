00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.950
Let's do an example of using
Newton's second law in problem

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:04.660
solving.

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:07.710
In this example, we'll figure
out why riding in an elevator

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.940
can give you a weird
sensation of weightlessness

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:13.070
or extra weight, depending on
which way you're accelerating.

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:15.110
So, let's say there's
a person standing

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:17.930
on a scale in the elevator
that's accelerating

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:20.710
upwards with some
acceleration a.

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:23.600
So we want to know
what the scale reads.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.250
First, we need to
really understand

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.490
what the scale measures.

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:30.120
The number that it gives you
is related to the normal force

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.960
that you are exerting
on the scale.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.520
So, this is a Newton's third law
pair force to the normal force

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.790
that the scale exerts on you.

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.680
So if we can figure out the
normal force on the person

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.590
from the scale, we'll know
what the scale should read.

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.900
Now let's set up our
coordinate system.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.830
I'm going to assign the upward
direction to be positive y.

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:56.910
And since the only
forces in this problem

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.800
are acting vertically,
I don't need

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.390
to define another direction.

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.285
I'll pick the system
to be the person.

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.289
Now, I'll think about what
we know and what we don't.

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:11.930
Since that person is
standing in the elevator--

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.060
not jumping, not
moving otherwise--

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.460
they must be
accelerating upwards

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.990
with acceleration a, the
acceleration of the elevator.

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.210
I also know the
mass of the person.

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.357
So now I have one side
of Newton's second law.

00:01:28.357 --> 00:01:30.440
Now I need to think about
what vertical forces are

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.240
acting on the person.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.490
First, there's the gravitational
force pulling the person down.

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:37.910
This gravitational
force does not

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:40.200
depend on the acceleration
of the elevator,

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.259
because the gravitational
interaction is just

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:44.570
between the person
and the earth.

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.740
So the force is minus m g.

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.280
Finally, I have the normal force
that's holding the person up.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.289
This is the normal force
from the interaction

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:55.514
between the person
and the scale.

00:01:55.514 --> 00:01:57.930
And so this is the unknown
quantity that I'd like to know.

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.160
Let's look at
Newton's second law.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.450
On the left, I have
f n, the normal force

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.580
that I'm interested
in, minus m g,

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.960
the gravitational
pull from the earth.

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.610
And on the right, I have
m, the person's mass,

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.310
times a, the acceleration
of the elevator

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.470
and, therefore, the person.

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.900
Notice that when the
elevator is accelerating,

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.760
the normal force and
the gravitational force

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.810
do not have the same magnitude.

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.820
That is, they don't cancel out.

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.180
So now I can solve
for f n, and I

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.460
can find that it's just m
times the quantity, a plus g.

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.360
Have you ever noticed that
at the bottom of an elevator

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.390
ride, when you're accelerating
upward, you feel heavier?

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.520
And at the top when
you're decelerating,

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.430
you often feel lighter?

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.630
You can see that if
I change a to minus a

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:52.930
in this example, that I'll
get the normal force is

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.526
equal to m times g minus a.

00:02:55.526 --> 00:02:58.630
And this explains that
feeling of lightness.

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.240
It's always good to check
that your answers match

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.714
physical intuition.

00:03:02.714 --> 00:03:04.130
And I encourage
you to go and play

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.937
with elevators and other
physical phenomena around you

00:03:06.937 --> 00:03:08.520
while you're going
through this course

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.610
to see if your answers
make physical sense.
