00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:11.400
I've just sent the better of
my hot plates to Japan.

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.530
None of this stuff is
quite straight.

00:00:33.528 --> 00:00:37.660
This is my apparatus for, which
we're going to use to

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.030
light a match with water.

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.510
Sounds an improbable thing to
do, but that's what's going to

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:43.770
happen hopefully.

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.180
I have never actually done this
before, so maybe it won't

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.510
happen, but we'll see.

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.730
So we're going to boil water
in here, over a Bunsen.

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.520
The steam is going to boil off,
flow through these tubes,

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:56.670
into the coil, and out here.

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.720
And while it's flowing around
the coil, we're going to try

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.190
and superheat it with
a blowtorch.

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.580
So when it comes out, it's
a few hundred degrees

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:08.570
centigrade.

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.870
And hopefully that will be
enough to light a match.

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.930
Of course it would have been
helpful if I'd filled that

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:22.180
from the hot tap.

00:01:27.175 --> 00:01:27.670
Oop.

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:29.049
Classic schoolboy error.

00:01:34.797 --> 00:01:35.276
OK.

00:01:35.276 --> 00:01:37.070
That will take a couple
minutes to come

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.200
to the boil, I think.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.340
You can't normally light
a match with

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.570
water, or even steam.

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:45.740
Because it's just
not hot enough.

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.800
The normal steam you get off
boiling water will condense

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.150
pretty much immediately on
anything because it's only

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:52.820
just above its boiling point.

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.310
So as soon as it hits anything
cooler, it will just condense.

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.036
It's getting hotter
quickly, actually.

00:02:01.036 --> 00:02:03.340
We want to really heat
the steam up to

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:04.440
a few hundred degrees.

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.020
At which point, hopefully we'll
exceed the autoignition

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.380
temperature of the head
of the match.

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.890
So the head will have a
temperature at which, if you

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.390
raise it to that temperature, it
will spontaneously ignite.

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:18.960
And that's what we're
trying to do.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.180
Just to heat this water hot
enough that that will happen.

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.540
OK.

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:32.826
So the thermometer is
reading quite a lot

00:02:32.826 --> 00:02:33.600
less than 100 degrees.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.080
But that's probably not
really a surprise.

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.880
We've got this huge coil, which
at the moment is acting

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:38.730
like a condenser.

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.960
So we're probably not getting
water above 100

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.350
degrees out the end.

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:43.730
Which is where the blowtorch
comes in.

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.120
So you saw just now, before I
started using the blowtorch,

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.370
there was a lot of condensed
water dripping out

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.334
the end of the pipe.

00:02:56.334 --> 00:02:58.600
The plume of droplets, the plume
of water mist that you

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.520
saw coming out as the water
condensed, is now pretty much

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:02.140
disappeared completely.

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:07.100
Because it's now too hot, and
it's not condensing when it

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.600
comes out at the end
of the pipe.

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.100
It's a bit of a problem juggling
all these extremely

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.725
hot objects.

00:03:10.725 --> 00:03:12.240
But - I'll probably just
take the blowtorch

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:13.490
away while I do this.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:17.030
Oh.

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.970
Not bad.

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.496
I've never seen a match
do that before.

00:03:20.496 --> 00:03:22.480
It sort of smoldered
without igniting.

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.640
Didn't know that was possible.

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:25.990
I wasn't convinced that
there was enough

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.900
heating going on there.

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.460
So I've got another
Bunsen out.

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:30.850
We'll see how we get
on with that.

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:34.140
So I've set the water
boiling off again.

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:35.390
Let's light this other Bunsen.

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:56.220
Now we've got our copper coil
actually glowing red hot.

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:00.530
So I think this is going
to do the job now.

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:03.640
I don't think it is that
easy to melt copper.

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.812
I think it'll radiate a
lot of heat before it

00:04:05.812 --> 00:04:06.500
gets to that point.

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.740
OK.

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:08.070
So let's give the thermometer
a go.

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:12.137
See if we're - see how
hot we might be.

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:18.860
It's really racing up.

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:26.620
Nope.

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:27.740
Hm.

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:29.290
I see.

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:31.240
Well, I've learned something
new today.

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:32.560
I've learnt that my thermometer
only goes up to

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:33.300
200 degrees.

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:34.700
So we've maxed it out.

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:39.210
Oh.

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:40.460
There we go.

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:45.710
That's a really interesting
observation, actually.

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:47.660
And I think that the problem we
had before was not so much

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:50.040
that it wasn't hot enough, but
that I was just holding the

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:54.030
match too directly in
the stream of steam.

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:56.140
And not pulling out as it
started to smolder.

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:58.970
And obviously, there is
no oxygen in what's

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:00.030
coming out of here.

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:01.990
This is pure gaseous water.

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:03.040
So there's no oxygen there.

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:04.890
So the match wasn't actually
able to ignite.

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:06.750
And I think that was probably
the problem.

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:08.900
And now: A, we've increased
the heat.

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:12.680
But B, if I just stick it into
the stream and then withdraw

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.846
it, to allow the air to
get to it, at that

00:05:15.846 --> 00:05:17.096
point the match ignites.
