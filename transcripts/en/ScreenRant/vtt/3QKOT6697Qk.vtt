00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:16.580
Don’t believe everything you see on TV,
even if its marketed as “reality”.

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.870
Most shows have a team of writers who decide
where the story arc goes and how it gets there.

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:24.200
So when a genre comes along that claims to
remove any behind the scenes meddling with

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.530
the story, audiences expect that the show
is being driven by the people on screen.

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:29.570
But in some cases, that couldn’t be farther
from the truth.

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.250
Here are Screen Rant’s 10 Shocking Secrets
Reality TV Producers Won’t Tell You.

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.170
The Celebrity Apprentice
The show runners of The Apprentice do their

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.850
best to make it look like hard work.

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.600
And for a long time, audiences bought it.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.329
But after a round of the show’s popular
celebrity edition, one star spoke out.

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:48.170
Penn Jillette, one half of the famous duo
Penn and Teller, wrote about his time as a

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:49.170
contestant.

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.609
And the reality is that the participants spend
most of their time waiting around doing nothing.

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:56.210
Jillette also stated that even when competition
time came around, they had nothing to do with

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:57.210
business.

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.800
He compared the experience to being in junior
high, saying the work is not very challenging,

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:01.860
and the people are crazy.

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.720
As for The Donald, Jillette had some choice
words about him too.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.460
And wrote that Trump’s hair “looks like
cotton candy made of piss.”

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:08.460
Burn.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.140
The Bachelor
Audiences are in love with love, and producers

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.360
have been capitalizing on that since day one.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.430
Perhaps the most blatant example comes in
the form of ABC’s The Bachelor.

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.740
If you’re unfamiliar with the show’s premise,
think of it like this: one bachelor goes shopping

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.500
for his soulmate amongst a group of pre-selected
ladies.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.369
With that much competition under one roof,
things get heated.

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.479
And apparently producers fan the flames by
filling the participants with booze.

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.540
Multiple ex-contestants have stated that they
were uncomfortable with the amount of alcohol

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.420
on set, and the constant suggestions that
they have more of it.

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.570
One past contestant even alleges that she
was kicked off the show for refusing a drink.

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.780
Big Brother
By this point, we know that the real stars

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.750
of reality TV are the producers standing just
off camera.They can have a lot of influence

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.840
on a shoot, and impact the final product in
a huge way.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.820
Fans of the long-running Big Brother have
leveled charges at the show’s production

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.960
team, accusing them of rigging competitions
in multiple seasons.

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.170
Some ex-houseguests have said that producers
pushed them to be as shallow as possible in

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.810
interviews, so that they could be quickly
identified by audiences.

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.130
The editing team isn’t unscathed either,
and have been accused of manipulating footage

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.289
to favor some participants over others.

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:10.510
Talk about being taken out of context.

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:13.980
Keeping Up With The Kardashians
Theres no room for secrets in a court of law.

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.150
So when the worlds of show business and criminal
justice collide, the public gets a rare glimpse

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.220
into what really goes on behind the scenes.

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.370
And at one point, it was the Kardashian clan
who had their day in court.

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.340
During divorce proceedings between Kim Kardashian
and Kris Humphries, one of the editors on

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.030
Keeping Up With The Kardashians testified
that not all of the show’s drama is real.

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.909
Some scenarios were fabricated by the team
using footage that was edited out of context.

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:37.810
And the whistleblower specifically mentioned
cutting the show to make Humphries look like

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.840
a colossal jerk.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.530
Duck Dynasty
How real does something have to be before

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.349
it can be labeled reality T.V.?

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:47.069
When it comes to Duck Dynasty, everyone has
a different answer.

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:50.430
The show came under fire after the stars let
slip that producers were in control of the

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:51.849
storyline, not the family.

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:54.989
The stars then backpedaled and emphasized
that since they created all the dialogue,

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:56.459
it’s not a scripted show.

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:59.830
But it turns out the family isn’t in control
of that either- as editors have inserted bleeps

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:01.720
to block out innocuous words.

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.930
Making the final scene look like a cuss-filled
one.

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.069
Dance Moms
Everything you need to know about the premise

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:09.450
of Dance Moms can be found right there in
the title.

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.569
It follows the mothers of a young group of
dancers as they interact with each other.

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:13.569
Simple right?

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:15.390
Well, it’s not actually that straightforward.

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:19.150
To spice up the show and kick up the drama,
show runners stage situations to make the

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:20.150
mom’s fight.

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.760
And judging by how often that happens, they
must be working overtime.

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.480
So it would only be natural to assume the
ladies hate each other for real… right?

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:27.480
Wrong.

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.160
Apparently as soon as filming stops, all animosity
disappears and it’s like nothing ever happened.

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.900
Talk about two-faced.

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.790
Who Wants To Be A Millionaire
If you’ve ever watched an episode of Who

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.209
Wants To Be A Millionaire and gotten every
answer right, then this next tidbit is going

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:40.360
to infuriate you.

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.480
The thing that differentiates Millionaire
from every other trivia show is its use of

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:44.480
lifelines.

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.319
If a contestant gets stuck, they’re able
to poll the audience, eliminate two wrong

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:49.680
answers, or phone a friend who they think
might know the answer.

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.079
The only logical problem with that last one
is that nobody can safeguard against the friend

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:54.890
hopping on the internet to look up an answer.

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:57.989
Turns out, that wasn’t actually a problem;
there wasn’t any rule specifically saying

00:03:57.989 --> 00:03:58.989
it wasn’t allowed.

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:02.670
The option was removed in 2010 anyway, when
the lifeline got cut from the show.

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:06.360
The Real Housewives of Orange County
Thanks to shows like The Hills and Laguna

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.920
Beach, audiences have become fascinated with
the lives of the California elite.

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:13.250
And will watch as tanned blondes run a circuit
of hair appointments, shopping dates, and

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:14.250
manicures.

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.610
Opponents have argued that this kind of entertainment
is built on a lie, and that some situations

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:21.010
would have completely different outcomes if
producers were truly hands-off.

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:24.340
But despite all the evidence that things aren’t
actually as they seem, fans were still shocked

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.560
to learn that some moments from The Real Housewives
of Orange County weren’t as genuine as they

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:28.560
were led to believe.

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.720
A text sent by one of the housewives confirmed
they were in on it, and spoiled one of the

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.110
show’s biggest engagement reveals.

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.340
House Hunters
Finding a house can be a nightmare.

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.190
And as it is with most nightmares, it’s
kind of entertaining watching it happen to

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:40.190
someone else.

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:43.419
House Hunters chronicles the quest for a perfect
home by following homeowner hopefuls as they

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:45.080
compare three different places to live.

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.320
The participants always end the show with
a new home, so every episode has a happy ending.

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:52.150
And they should, considering that everyone
who applies to be on the show has to already

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:53.360
own one of the houses.

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:54.360
That’s right!

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.720
Participants know which house they’re going
to buy because they’ve already bought it.

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:58.889
Which kind of ruins the whole thing.

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:00.979
Cribs
Since there have been stars, there have been

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:03.470
tour guides trying to make a buck off showing
us where they life.

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:06.169
MTV took that idea and ran with it in their
show Cribs.

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:08.990
If you’ve ever watched an episode, you’ve
probably fantasized about having your very

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:09.990
own mansion.

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:13.449
Add a couple of european sportscars, a pool,
and a fridge stocked full of beer, and you’ve

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:14.740
got yourself a good time.

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:17.789
All the segments start with the same promise,
that the house we’re about to see belongs

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:19.180
to the celebrity giving the tour.

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:23.039
So when one homeowner tuned into the show
and saw Ja Rule giving a tour of her home,

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:24.200
she filed a lawsuit.

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:27.430
It turns out, the rapper had rented the place
for a weekend, and played it off as his own

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:28.940
for the crew.

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:29.940
What do you think of our list?

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:32.440
Do you know of any other behind the scenes
secrets from reality T.V. shows?
