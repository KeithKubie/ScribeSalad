00:00:00.406 --> 00:00:04.310
HTML 5 edit types for phone numbers, email addresses,

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:07.720
URLs, numbers and dates, among others. For each one of

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:10.010
these fields, I can go into the depth fields and

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:13.250
change it. For example, email, right now, gives me the

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:15.990
standard keyboard. But, if I go in and change

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.760
its type to email, you may notice one subtle difference.

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.320
And I now get an @ symbol on my keyboard

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.330
by default. Some of the biggest changes were for dates,

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:33.050
where I now get an actual calendar and colors, where not only do I

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:39.500
get a nice color selection box, but I can actually edit the color. And finally,

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.030
there's a simple number input type. You'll

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.510
notice this is somewhat like the number input

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.799
for telephone numbers, except there's no alpha

00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:49.110
numeric's and there's no hash and star sign.
