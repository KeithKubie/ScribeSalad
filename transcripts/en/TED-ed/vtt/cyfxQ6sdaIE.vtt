00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:12.750
In a Moment of Vision...

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.070
Early 1800s.

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.071
It's the middle of the Napoleonic Wars
in the middle of Europe,

00:00:17.071 --> 00:00:19.210
and it's the middle of the night.

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:22.041
One Captain Charles Barbier
of Napoleon's army

00:00:22.041 --> 00:00:25.130
is trying to relay a message
to one of his troops.

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:27.980
But sending written communications
to the front lines

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:29.930
can be deadly for the recipient.

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:35.310
Lighting a candle to read the missive can 
give away their positions to the enemy.

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:37.421
In a moment of vision,

00:00:37.421 --> 00:00:41.491
Barbier pokes a series of holes
into a sheet of a paper with his blade,

00:00:41.491 --> 00:00:44.701
creating a coded message that can be
deciphered by fingertip,

00:00:44.701 --> 00:00:47.190
even in the pitch black.

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.131
The merits of his so-called night writing
are never acknowledged by the military,

00:00:52.131 --> 00:00:56.751
but in 1821, Barbier approaches the
Royal Institute for Blind Youth in Paris

00:00:56.751 --> 00:00:58.690
in the hopes that they might find a use

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.152
for his innovative, 
new communication method.

00:01:02.152 --> 00:01:06.531
There, a precocious teen by the name
of Louis Braille does just that.

00:01:06.531 --> 00:01:10.152
Louis spends the next several years
improving on Barbier's idea,

00:01:10.152 --> 00:01:16.013
creating an organized alphabet
fitting into a six dot standardized cell.

00:01:16.013 --> 00:01:18.832
The system catches on.

00:01:18.832 --> 00:01:23.592
Today, Braille is the universally accepted
system of writing for the blind,

00:01:23.592 --> 00:01:26.392
adapted for more than 130 languages.
