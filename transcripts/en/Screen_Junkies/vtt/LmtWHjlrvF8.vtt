00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.900
In a world full of loud movies,

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:13.320
Starring loud people

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:14.080
"SPARTA!"

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:17.900
Played to theaters full of loud fans.

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.080
One premise will shock and horrify the modern audience:

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.020
Having to shut the f*ck up.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.800
[Relieved sigh]

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:31.160
That's better.

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.950
*Psst* Hey, can we get an epic ASL guy to help me out here?

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.320
Perfect

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.760
Explore the near future of A Quiet Place.

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.460
On one hand, it's a dystopia where blind aliens

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.140
kill anyone who makes a sound.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:50.680
But on the other,

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.100
it's every dad's paradise

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.760
where a father of three children can finally get some peace and quiet

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.340
With plenty of time for fishing,

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.040
farm-to-table meals,

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.260
and a man cave full of TVs that your kids are not allowed to enter.

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.320
Hey, *Psst* Hey dude, can we like trade lives, please?

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.580
Watch The Office's John Krasinski

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.720
prove he's more than just a pretty Jim face.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.860
But a wide range of pretty Jim faces.

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.513
With support from real-life wife Emily Blunt,

00:01:21.513 --> 00:01:23.400
the most badass female character

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.729
That's also barefoot, pregnant, and not allowed to speak

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.834
But it's behind the camera where JK really shines,

00:01:29.834 --> 00:01:31.559
as he makes a directing debut

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:33.780
that's one part Ridley Scott,

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.380
one part James Cameron Titanic references?

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.380
and six parts Tarantino foot shots.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:54.820
[Tarantino-esque guitar riffs]

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:55.680
Ahh!

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:56.200
Oh! sorry,

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.860
haven't yelled like that since Marv in Home Alone.

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.800
[screams in pain]

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.500
Prepare for an awesome original horror movie premise

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.500
as long as you don't think too hard about it.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.100
Where everyone always looks like they're holding in a fart

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.860
because a fart or burp or sneeze would equal death.

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.240
Where footsteps are too loud,

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.680
but snapping your fingers is fine.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.000
And where this waterfall lets you be as noisy as you want:

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:22.640
"Wooo!"

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.940
But they don't just live next to the waterfall? I mean, come on!

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.160
Don't even get me started on the ending and military-grade sonic weaponry.

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.420
The government's already developing it under the Denver Airport

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.680
So if you love survival horror movies

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:39.860
and feature-length ASMR videos,

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:41.060
strap in--

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.760
but carefully, cause the straps can get like, really noisy--

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.040
for a film that started its life as a potential Cloverfield sequel,

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.420
but in the capable hands of Big Tuna

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.197
became a really solid one-off film.

00:02:51.197 --> 00:02:51.959
I mean, come on

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.560
we don't need a sequel

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.340
unless it's like a super quiet 'Aliens'.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.280
[whispers] Game over man! Game over!

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:34.200
The Quiet Game

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.480
This is a good reminder that Monopoly sucks

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.040
and will get you killed in the apocalypse.

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.900
As if you ever needed another reason not to play Monopoly, right?

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.200
Hey, thanks for helping out Epic ASL guy

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.960
I'm just gonna pretend that means you're welcome

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.460
Disestablishmentarianism is a big word

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.220
You're not the only one cursed with knowledge

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:05.390
Everything,

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:06.720
Starring the Rock

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.540
Blessed be the Fruit Loops.

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:13.740
[as Pooh] I just read these comments out loud because I like them.

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.220
*Pooh laugh*
