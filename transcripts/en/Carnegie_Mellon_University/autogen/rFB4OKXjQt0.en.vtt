architecture and drama and seen a

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750
architecture and drama and seen a
 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:32.420
architecture and drama and seen a
graphic design I've learned a lot of

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430
graphic design I've learned a lot of
 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.970
graphic design I've learned a lot of
things from the drama students in

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980
things from the drama students in
 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.319
things from the drama students in
particular because they know so much

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329
particular because they know so much
 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.090
particular because they know so much
about the workings of theatres and it's

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100
about the workings of theatres and it's
 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.069
about the workings of theatres and it's
really added depth and complexity to my

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079
really added depth and complexity to my
 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.020
really added depth and complexity to my
projects which I appreciate so much

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030
projects which I appreciate so much
 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.940
projects which I appreciate so much
because that's not something that I

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950
because that's not something that I
 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.529
because that's not something that I
might have figured out by myself and

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539
might have figured out by myself and
 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.779
might have figured out by myself and
having that extra experience is really

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789
having that extra experience is really
 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.340
having that extra experience is really
nice because you not only get to make

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350
nice because you not only get to make
 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.990
nice because you not only get to make
new connections and your friends but you

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000
new connections and your friends but you
 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.130
new connections and your friends but you
also learn a lot from them I think that

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.140
also learn a lot from them I think that
 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:55.970
also learn a lot from them I think that
interdisciplinary work really is the

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980
interdisciplinary work really is the
 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.610
interdisciplinary work really is the
future of design and working with all of

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620
future of design and working with all of
 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.819
future of design and working with all of
these different types of programs and

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:00.829
these different types of programs and
 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:03.229
these different types of programs and
students from other departments is

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239
students from other departments is
 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.299
students from other departments is
really helping bring more information to

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309
really helping bring more information to
 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:06.890
really helping bring more information to
light and we can't do the project

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900
light and we can't do the project
 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.140
light and we can't do the project
ourselves obviously no one can so we

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150
ourselves obviously no one can so we
 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.780
ourselves obviously no one can so we
want to understand what performance

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790
want to understand what performance
 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.840
want to understand what performance
spaces of all types can be like how the

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850
spaces of all types can be like how the
 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.850
spaces of all types can be like how the
process of the design of such a facility

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860
process of the design of such a facility
 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.530
process of the design of such a facility
occurs the methodology through which the

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540
occurs the methodology through which the
 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.359
occurs the methodology through which the
different players not just the actors

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369
different players not just the actors
 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.670
different players not just the actors
themselves but the producers artistic

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680
themselves but the producers artistic

and most importantly ultimately the
 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.810
and most importantly ultimately the
audience who consumes this work I think

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820
audience who consumes this work I think
 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.319
audience who consumes this work I think
having some experience in the production

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329
having some experience in the production
 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.240
having some experience in the production
side of things is very it's very

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250

knowledgeable asset to have in this
 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.749
knowledgeable asset to have in this
class it's really great to sort of

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759
class it's really great to sort of
 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.170
class it's really great to sort of
reflect on what my responsibility is and

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180
reflect on what my responsibility is and
 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.030
reflect on what my responsibility is and
what my role is as a theatre artist and

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040
what my role is as a theatre artist and
 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.270
what my role is as a theatre artist and
then to analyze that in relation to

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280
then to analyze that in relation to
 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.550
then to analyze that in relation to
others and then sort of saying okay this

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560
others and then sort of saying okay this
 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.469
others and then sort of saying okay this
is this is what how we can optimize this

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479
is this is what how we can optimize this
 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.959
is this is what how we can optimize this
this is the solution for this space this

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969
this is the solution for this space this
 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.310
this is the solution for this space this
is why we should do this and this

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320
is why we should do this and this
 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.170
is why we should do this and this
solution might not work just getting to

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180
solution might not work just getting to
 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.730
solution might not work just getting to
kind of see the site and look at other

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740
kind of see the site and look at other
 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.830
kind of see the site and look at other
theatres as reference and just visit

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840
theatres as reference and just visit
 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.530
theatres as reference and just visit
different architecture firms

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:05.540
different architecture firms
 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:06.730
different architecture firms
definitely help me realize the

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740
definitely help me realize the
 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.650
definitely help me realize the
importance of things like researching

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660
importance of things like researching
 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.389
importance of things like researching
your site researching historical

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399
your site researching historical
 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:12.850
your site researching historical
background but also kind of doing a lot

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860
background but also kind of doing a lot
 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.680
background but also kind of doing a lot
of the pre design process like having

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690
of the pre design process like having
 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.170
of the pre design process like having
the right models and just kind of idea

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180
the right models and just kind of idea
 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.000
the right models and just kind of idea
of what would fit best in the space that

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010
of what would fit best in the space that
 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.160
of what would fit best in the space that
you have
