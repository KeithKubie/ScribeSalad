00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.839
For the first six months as a Udacity

00:00:01.839 --> 00:00:04.460
employee, I thought one of our coffee machines was

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:08.270
broken. Because it didn't work immediately upon me pushing

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:11.350
a specific button. What I eventually learned from a

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:14.020
colleague, was that the coffee machine needed time to

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:17.880
warm up prior to processing my request. This important

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.030
step wasn't part of my conceptual model. Hence, the

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:25.280
misunderstanding. The coffee machine failed me, by not providing

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.520
appropriate feedback. It should have let me

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.890
know that it had received my request. And

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.400
was taking time to warm up. We'll

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.910
cover the important topic of feedback more, soon.
