about how to get their users signed in
 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:13.990
about how to get their users signed in
or signed up and it's probably a problem

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000
or signed up and it's probably a problem
 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.670

at a bunch of startups and this is I
 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:23.290
at a bunch of startups and this is I
think one of the fundamental problems

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:23.300
think one of the fundamental problems
 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:24.640
think one of the fundamental problems
that if you need to have some kind of

able to personalize content to them you

sign up or sign into a service it's
 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.130
sign up or sign into a service it's
something that where you could have in

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140
something that where you could have in
 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.750
something that where you could have in
fact a lot of the apps that we work with

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:40.760
fact a lot of the apps that we work with
 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.270
fact a lot of the apps that we work with
have seen that in the order of 50

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280
have seen that in the order of 50
 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.560
have seen that in the order of 50
percent of the people who see their

percent of the people who see their

login screen just take off or fail to
 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:48.970
login screen just take off or fail to
login in the first place and so that is

login in the first place and so that is
 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:51.640
login in the first place and so that is
there's really a major problem if you

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:51.650
there's really a major problem if you
 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:53.140
there's really a major problem if you
know 50 percent of the potential people

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:53.150
know 50 percent of the potential people
 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:54.520
know 50 percent of the potential people
who are using your app for your service

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530
who are using your app for your service
 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.380
who are using your app for your service
are going to evaporate right away before

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390
are going to evaporate right away before
 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.750
are going to evaporate right away before
they even get in the door so thinking

00:01:58.750 --> 00:01:58.760
they even get in the door so thinking
 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.610
they even get in the door so thinking
about that and putting it kind of in the

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:00.620
about that and putting it kind of in the
 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.200
about that and putting it kind of in the
perspective of all these things you have

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210
perspective of all these things you have
 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:03.610
perspective of all these things you have
to think about performance and getting

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:03.620
to think about performance and getting
 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.190
to think about performance and getting
users into your apps making sure that

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200
users into your apps making sure that
 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.810
users into your apps making sure that
that is as frictionless as possible is

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820
that is as frictionless as possible is
 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.580
that is as frictionless as possible is
really one of the key ones that you have

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590
really one of the key ones that you have
 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:10.960
really one of the key ones that you have
to keep in mind and so that's what we're

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970
to keep in mind and so that's what we're
 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:12.820
to keep in mind and so that's what we're
going to talk about here some of the

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830
going to talk about here some of the
 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:13.450
going to talk about here some of the
solutions the

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460
solutions the
 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:14.680
solutions the
you've probably heard about before

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690
you've probably heard about before
 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.330
you've probably heard about before
things like Google sign-in if you've

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340
things like Google sign-in if you've
 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.250
things like Google sign-in if you've
wandered around the web you see these

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260
wandered around the web you see these
 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:19.660
wandered around the web you see these
Google sign-in buttons all over the

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670
Google sign-in buttons all over the
 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.700
Google sign-in buttons all over the
place and it is a really nice solution

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:21.710
place and it is a really nice solution
 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:24.370
place and it is a really nice solution
it certainly gives you the ability to

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380
it certainly gives you the ability to
 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.800
it certainly gives you the ability to
login with with a click without having

to create more usernames and passwords

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040
to create more usernames and passwords
 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.220
to create more usernames and passwords
it's kind of the opportunity to replace

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230
it's kind of the opportunity to replace
 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.500
it's kind of the opportunity to replace
some of these password logins that

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510
some of these password logins that
 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.630
some of these password logins that
you've maybe used in the past but it's

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640
you've maybe used in the past but it's
 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.090
you've maybe used in the past but it's
not the complete solution in that there

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100
not the complete solution in that there
 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.010
not the complete solution in that there
are still apps and sites out there that

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020
are still apps and sites out there that
 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.130
are still apps and sites out there that
use passwords and usernames and we have

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140
use passwords and usernames and we have
 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:43.420
use passwords and usernames and we have
to think about what to do there and

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430
to think about what to do there and
 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.160
to think about what to do there and
that's what one of the new technologies

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170
that's what one of the new technologies
 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:46.570
that's what one of the new technologies
that I'd like to talk about today which

make it available programmatically on
Android so very cool and I think it's

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340
Android so very cool and I think it's
 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:02.470
Android so very cool and I think it's
one of the most exciting things that

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480
one of the most exciting things that
 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.900
one of the most exciting things that
we've seen in 1/10 ocation space in a

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910
we've seen in 1/10 ocation space in a
 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:09.640
we've seen in 1/10 ocation space in a
long time so just to get into what I'll

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650
long time so just to get into what I'll
 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:10.990

Google sign-in is this cross-platform

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780
Google sign-in is this cross-platform
 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.860
Google sign-in is this cross-platform
solution it works on iOS and Android and

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870
solution it works on iOS and Android and
 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.900
solution it works on iOS and Android and
on the web that it makes signing in or

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910
on the web that it makes signing in or
 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:25.300
on the web that it makes signing in or
signing up really easy that it enables

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310
signing up really easy that it enables
 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.220
signing up really easy that it enables
access to a lot of other Google API so

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230
access to a lot of other Google API so
 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.200
access to a lot of other Google API so
very useful there and that it can

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:29.210
very useful there and that it can
 

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:30.730
very useful there and that it can
facilitate some nice things like being

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:30.740
facilitate some nice things like being
 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:33.190

while and I kind of use this analogy of

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:38.080
while and I kind of use this analogy of
 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.630
while and I kind of use this analogy of
comparing the Google sign-in which is

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640
comparing the Google sign-in which is
 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.310
comparing the Google sign-in which is
like a replacement for the different

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:42.320
like a replacement for the different
 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.800
like a replacement for the different
keys you may use to login to different

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810
keys you may use to login to different
 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.660
keys you may use to login to different
services around the web you can kind of

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670
services around the web you can kind of
 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.480
services around the web you can kind of
imagine going from site to site and each

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:49.490

to unlock you have to have a different

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220
to unlock you have to have a different
 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.810
to unlock you have to have a different
key and over over time you accumulate a

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:55.820
key and over over time you accumulate a
 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:57.610
key and over over time you accumulate a
lot of these keys they get pretty heavy

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620
lot of these keys they get pretty heavy
 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.460
lot of these keys they get pretty heavy
in your pocket and you kind of end up in

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470
in your pocket and you kind of end up in
 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:01.960
in your pocket and you kind of end up in
this situation where it's nice to have a

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:01.970
this situation where it's nice to have a
 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.000
this situation where it's nice to have a
Google sign in but you still have a lot

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010
Google sign in but you still have a lot
 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:06.730
Google sign in but you still have a lot
in your pocket to worry about and to

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:06.740
in your pocket to worry about and to
 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:08.320

kind of complete the analogy then the
 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:09.610
kind of complete the analogy then the
idea behind a smart lock for passwords

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620
idea behind a smart lock for passwords
 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.580
idea behind a smart lock for passwords
is that you can put all these keys on a

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:12.590
is that you can put all these keys on a
 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:14.440
is that you can put all these keys on a
keychain kind of in the same idea as a

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450
keychain kind of in the same idea as a
 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:16.300
keychain kind of in the same idea as a
password manager but by making it a

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310
password manager but by making it a
 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:18.310
password manager but by making it a
programmatic interface we can do a lot

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320
programmatic interface we can do a lot
 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:19.680
programmatic interface we can do a lot
more that we can build user interfaces

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690
more that we can build user interfaces
 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.390
more that we can build user interfaces
that don't even involve a sign-in screen

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400
that don't even involve a sign-in screen
 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.340
that don't even involve a sign-in screen
anymore if you can programmatically pull

present a problem like if you've got

00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:11.750
present a problem like if you've got
 

00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:14.020
present a problem like if you've got
that heavy pocketful of keys then you

00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:14.030
that heavy pocketful of keys then you
 

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:16.060
that heavy pocketful of keys then you
might think about ways to lighten the

00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:16.070
might think about ways to lighten the
 

00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:17.950
might think about ways to lighten the
load that if you just went out there and

00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:17.960
load that if you just went out there and
 

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:19.720
load that if you just went out there and
used one key across all the doors that

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:19.730
used one key across all the doors that
 

00:10:19.730 --> 00:10:21.400
used one key across all the doors that
you came across then you'd only have

00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:21.410
you came across then you'd only have
 

00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:22.990
you came across then you'd only have
that one torii about or if you used a

00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:23.000
that one torii about or if you used a
 

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.850
that one torii about or if you used a
really simple light one that's easy to

00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:24.860
really simple light one that's easy to
 

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:27.730
really simple light one that's easy to
remember an easy password you can

00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:27.740
remember an easy password you can
 

00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:29.260
remember an easy password you can
certainly light in your pocket but it

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:29.270
certainly light in your pocket but it
 

00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:30.790
certainly light in your pocket but it
can also introduce a pretty major

00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:30.800
can also introduce a pretty major
 

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:32.770
can also introduce a pretty major
security vulnerability which is that if

00:10:32.770 --> 00:10:32.780
security vulnerability which is that if
 

00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:35.170
security vulnerability which is that if
that one key that you rely on get stolen

00:10:35.170 --> 00:10:35.180
that one key that you rely on get stolen
 

00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:37.450
that one key that you rely on get stolen
gets picked out of your pocket then

00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:37.460
gets picked out of your pocket then
 

00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:39.550
gets picked out of your pocket then
people can basically walk through all of

00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:39.560
people can basically walk through all of
 

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:42.070
people can basically walk through all of
the doors that you would encounter and

00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:42.080
the doors that you would encounter and
 

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:44.230
the doors that you would encounter and
if that key is really light and simple

00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:44.240
if that key is really light and simple
 

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:46.300
if that key is really light and simple
easy to counterfeit you have the same

00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:46.310
easy to counterfeit you have the same
 

00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:49.200
easy to counterfeit you have the same
problem so thinking about how to

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:49.210
problem so thinking about how to
 

00:10:49.210 --> 00:10:52.090
problem so thinking about how to
encourage people to move to stronger

00:10:52.090 --> 00:10:52.100
encourage people to move to stronger
 

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:54.370
encourage people to move to stronger
passwords make them easier to use and

00:10:54.370 --> 00:10:54.380
passwords make them easier to use and
 

00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:57.370
passwords make them easier to use and
then eventually move to ways to move

00:10:57.370 --> 00:10:57.380
then eventually move to ways to move
 

00:10:57.380 --> 00:10:59.710
then eventually move to ways to move
beyond passwords is really where we're

00:10:59.710 --> 00:10:59.720
beyond passwords is really where we're
 

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:02.380
beyond passwords is really where we're
trying to get the industry to to go and

00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:02.390
trying to get the industry to to go and
 

00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:04.000
trying to get the industry to to go and
by providing these api's to the

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:04.010
by providing these api's to the
 

00:11:04.010 --> 00:11:05.850
by providing these api's to the
third-party ecosystem on and

third-party ecosystem on and
 

00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:07.920
third-party ecosystem on and
we hope to make that a lot easier so let

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:07.930
we hope to make that a lot easier so let
 

00:11:07.930 --> 00:11:09.720
we hope to make that a lot easier so let
me get into smart lock for passwords and

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:09.730
me get into smart lock for passwords and
 

00:11:09.730 --> 00:11:12.410
me get into smart lock for passwords and
again I'll just motivate it by saying

00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:12.420
again I'll just motivate it by saying
 

00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:14.940
again I'll just motivate it by saying
that this is probably one of the things

00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:14.950
that this is probably one of the things

that this is probably one of the things
that as an app developer you're really

00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:17.260
that as an app developer you're really
 

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.650
that as an app developer you're really
conscious of that there's a lot of time

00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:19.660
conscious of that there's a lot of time
 

00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:21.330
conscious of that there's a lot of time
and effort and energy that goes into

00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:21.340
and effort and energy that goes into

what it is that you're offering to them
and to get them to download the app can

00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:29.080
and to get them to download the app can
 

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:30.630
and to get them to download the app can
be a pretty expensive and time-consuming

00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:30.640
be a pretty expensive and time-consuming
 

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:32.880
be a pretty expensive and time-consuming
process and that's just the beginning

then you have to get them to open it to
get engaged and that means potentially

00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:37.720
get engaged and that means potentially

in it's very often the case that it

00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:04.930

something really confusing all

something really confusing all
problematic and I think like the

00:12:15.930 --> 00:12:15.940
problematic and I think like the
 

00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:18.270
problematic and I think like the
opportunity here is that to get to that

00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:18.280
opportunity here is that to get to that

00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:38.230
architecture here like I mentioned
 

00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:40.020
architecture here like I mentioned
earlier one way to think about it is

00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:40.030
earlier one way to think about it is
 

00:12:40.030 --> 00:12:43.200
earlier one way to think about it is

now you open up the New York Times app
and it shows you the login screen yet

what the password was and then it's a
 

00:14:06.130 --> 00:14:07.950
what the password was and then it's a
very very painful experience of

00:14:07.950 --> 00:14:07.960
very very painful experience of
 

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:10.230

of the apps are kind of put back onto

00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:36.310
of the apps are kind of put back onto
 

00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:38.220
of the apps are kind of put back onto

00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:38.230
the new device there even in the same
 

00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:40.230
the new device there even in the same
place but again this fundamental problem

00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:40.240
place but again this fundamental problem
 

00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:41.760
place but again this fundamental problem
of opening that app and seeing but it's

00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:41.770
of opening that app and seeing but it's
 

00:14:41.770 --> 00:14:44.190
of opening that app and seeing but it's
not signed in so now look what the

00:14:44.190 --> 00:14:44.200
not signed in so now look what the
 

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:46.320
not signed in so now look what the
experience is with this API integration

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:46.330
experience is with this API integration
 

00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:47.940
experience is with this API integration
as soon as that New York Times app is

00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:47.950
as soon as that New York Times app is
 

00:14:47.950 --> 00:14:49.620
as soon as that New York Times app is
opened there's a notification here to

00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:49.630
opened there's a notification here to
 

00:14:49.630 --> 00:14:51.510
opened there's a notification here to
the user this is a first-run experience

00:14:51.510 --> 00:14:51.520
the user this is a first-run experience
 

00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:53.490
the user this is a first-run experience
the text is a little bit hard to read on

00:14:53.490 --> 00:14:53.500
the text is a little bit hard to read on
 

00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:55.260
the text is a little bit hard to read on
the screen here but basically what it's

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:55.270
the screen here but basically what it's
 

00:14:55.270 --> 00:14:57.150
the screen here but basically what it's
saying is that you've been signed back

00:14:57.150 --> 00:14:57.160
saying is that you've been signed back
 

00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:58.800
saying is that you've been signed back

you saved with Google so the last time

00:15:00.510 --> 00:15:00.520
you saved with Google so the last time

you saved with Google so the last time
you use this on an Android device you

00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:02.530
you use this on an Android device you
 

00:15:02.530 --> 00:15:04.530
you use this on an Android device you
opted in to save whatever login from

00:15:04.530 --> 00:15:04.540
opted in to save whatever login from
 

00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:07.290
opted in to save whatever login from
information that you input and now it's

information that you input and now it's
 

00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:09.210
information that you input and now it's
been retrieved programmatically by the

been retrieved programmatically by the
 

00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:12.330
been retrieved programmatically by the
app the app is able to look at what kind

00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:12.340
app the app is able to look at what kind
 

00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:13.860
app the app is able to look at what kind
of login information is available for

00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:13.870
of login information is available for
 

00:15:13.870 --> 00:15:15.600
of login information is available for
this user and then it be able to

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:15.610
this user and then it be able to
 

00:15:15.610 --> 00:15:17.580
this user and then it be able to
basically use it to skip the login

00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:17.590
basically use it to skip the login
 

00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:19.320
basically use it to skip the login
screen so just think about that for a

00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:19.330
screen so just think about that for a
 

00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:21.360
screen so just think about that for a
second that it's not just the experience

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:21.370
second that it's not just the experience
 

00:15:21.370 --> 00:15:22.950
second that it's not just the experience
that you've seen in Chrome where your

00:15:22.950 --> 00:15:22.960
that you've seen in Chrome where your
 

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:24.660
that you've seen in Chrome where your
username and password is filled in and

00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:24.670
username and password is filled in and
 

00:15:24.670 --> 00:15:26.610
username and password is filled in and
the user still has to find the login

00:15:26.610 --> 00:15:26.620
the user still has to find the login
 

00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:28.800
the user still has to find the login
page it's that this user just opens up

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:28.810
page it's that this user just opens up
 

00:15:28.810 --> 00:15:30.329
page it's that this user just opens up
the app and they're in just like that

00:15:30.329 --> 00:15:30.339
the app and they're in just like that
 

00:15:30.339 --> 00:15:33.420
the app and they're in just like that
and then of course being the cross

00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:33.430
and then of course being the cross
 

00:15:33.430 --> 00:15:35.370
and then of course being the cross
solution you can think about other

00:15:35.370 --> 00:15:35.380
solution you can think about other
 

00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:37.020
solution you can think about other
scenarios where this is really powerful

00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:37.030
scenarios where this is really powerful
 

00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:39.390
scenarios where this is really powerful
so let's use Eventbrite for a second

00:15:39.390 --> 00:15:39.400
so let's use Eventbrite for a second
 

00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:41.490
so let's use Eventbrite for a second
example and like I said earlier

00:15:41.490 --> 00:15:41.500
example and like I said earlier
 

00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:43.560
example and like I said earlier
Eventbrite was one of the ticketing apps

00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:43.570
Eventbrite was one of the ticketing apps
 

00:15:43.570 --> 00:15:45.570
Eventbrite was one of the ticketing apps
I think for this event and probably for

00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:45.580
I think for this event and probably for
 

00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:47.130
I think for this event and probably for
a lot of others that you might encounter

00:15:47.130 --> 00:15:47.140
a lot of others that you might encounter
 

00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:49.560
a lot of others that you might encounter
and maybe this time you start on the web

00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:49.570
and maybe this time you start on the web
 

00:15:49.570 --> 00:15:51.270
and maybe this time you start on the web
where you actually made the purchase of

00:15:51.270 --> 00:15:51.280
where you actually made the purchase of
 

00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:53.940
where you actually made the purchase of
tickets or something like that and you

00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:53.950
tickets or something like that and you
 

00:15:53.950 --> 00:15:55.440
tickets or something like that and you
could very well have being an event

00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:55.450
could very well have being an event
 

00:15:55.450 --> 00:15:57.240
could very well have being an event

like Eventbrite in the chrome password
manager and if you've signed in to

00:16:06.630 --> 00:16:06.640
manager and if you've signed in to
 

00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:08.640
manager and if you've signed in to
Chrome then you've basically synced all

00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:08.650
Chrome then you've basically synced all
 

00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:10.140
Chrome then you've basically synced all
of this information up to the cloud

00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:10.150
of this information up to the cloud
 

00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:12.060
of this information up to the cloud
you've saved it with your Google account

00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:12.070
you've saved it with your Google account
 

00:16:12.070 --> 00:16:14.040
you've saved it with your Google account
and if you go to another device with

00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:14.050
and if you go to another device with
 

00:16:14.050 --> 00:16:15.870
and if you go to another device with
Chrome it'll very helpfully fill it in

00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:15.880
Chrome it'll very helpfully fill it in
 

00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:17.880
Chrome it'll very helpfully fill it in
for you but of course you end up in an

00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:17.890
for you but of course you end up in an
 

00:16:17.890 --> 00:16:20.520
for you but of course you end up in an
app and so maybe you're in the line here

00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:20.530
app and so maybe you're in the line here
 

00:16:20.530 --> 00:16:21.720
app and so maybe you're in the line here
and you need to show your ticket

00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:21.730
and you need to show your ticket
 

00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:23.310
and you need to show your ticket

everybody's waiting behind you and if
 

00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:24.840
everybody's waiting behind you and if
you open up the app and realize that you

00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:24.850
you open up the app and realize that you
 

00:16:24.850 --> 00:16:27.030
you open up the app and realize that you
need to log in to get that ticket it can

00:16:27.030 --> 00:16:27.040
need to log in to get that ticket it can
 

00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:28.830
need to log in to get that ticket it can
be pretty stressful to you know type

00:16:28.830 --> 00:16:28.840
be pretty stressful to you know type
 

00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:30.810

everyone's waiting and hope that you've

00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:32.350
everyone's waiting and hope that you've
 

00:16:32.350 --> 00:16:34.320
everyone's waiting and hope that you've
got the right password so the experience

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:34.330
got the right password so the experience
 

00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:36.210
got the right password so the experience
now if you just open up the app with

00:16:36.210 --> 00:16:36.220
now if you just open up the app with
 

00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:37.770
now if you just open up the app with
this integration in it and you can try

00:16:37.770 --> 00:16:37.780
this integration in it and you can try
 

00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:39.510
this integration in it and you can try
this out yourself if you you might

00:16:39.510 --> 00:16:39.520
this out yourself if you you might
 

00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:40.950
this out yourself if you you might
already be signed into Eventbrite but if

00:16:40.950 --> 00:16:40.960
already be signed into Eventbrite but if
 

00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:43.830
already be signed into Eventbrite but if
you uninstall and and reinstall it you

00:16:43.830 --> 00:16:43.840
you uninstall and and reinstall it you
 

00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:45.570
you uninstall and and reinstall it you
can actually see how it will just sign

00:16:45.570 --> 00:16:45.580
can actually see how it will just sign
 

00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:46.800
can actually see how it will just sign
you and automatically don't give you

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:46.810
you and automatically don't give you
 

00:16:46.810 --> 00:16:48.320
you and automatically don't give you
this blue bar at the bottom that says

00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:48.330
this blue bar at the bottom that says
 

00:16:48.330 --> 00:16:51.390
this blue bar at the bottom that says
your login information and from that

00:16:51.390 --> 00:16:51.400
your login information and from that
 

00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:53.250
your login information and from that
point on again you've basically just

00:16:53.250 --> 00:16:53.260
point on again you've basically just
 

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:56.190
point on again you've basically just
skipped the entire login flow and you as

00:16:56.190 --> 00:16:56.200
skipped the entire login flow and you as
 

00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:57.690
skipped the entire login flow and you as
an app developer you can think about how

00:16:57.690 --> 00:16:57.700
an app developer you can think about how
 

00:16:57.700 --> 00:16:59.640
an app developer you can think about how
valuable this is that you can skip all

00:16:59.640 --> 00:16:59.650
valuable this is that you can skip all
 

00:16:59.650 --> 00:17:02.400
valuable this is that you can skip all
of the warm welcomes and the things that

00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:02.410
of the warm welcomes and the things that
 

00:17:02.410 --> 00:17:04.199
of the warm welcomes and the things that
are just getting in the way of your

00:17:04.199 --> 00:17:04.209
are just getting in the way of your
 

00:17:04.209 --> 00:17:06.240
are just getting in the way of your
really engaged and most valuable users

00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:06.250
really engaged and most valuable users
 

00:17:06.250 --> 00:17:10.800
really engaged and most valuable users
getting to their content okay so that's

00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:10.810
getting to their content okay so that's
 

00:17:10.810 --> 00:17:13.500
getting to their content okay so that's
Eventbrite and and let's walk through

00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:13.510
Eventbrite and and let's walk through
 

00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:15.270
Eventbrite and and let's walk through
maybe one more example so think about

00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:15.280
maybe one more example so think about
 

00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:17.100
maybe one more example so think about
moving in the other direction and

00:17:17.100 --> 00:17:17.110
moving in the other direction and
 

00:17:17.110 --> 00:17:18.510
moving in the other direction and
thinking about some of the other

00:17:18.510 --> 00:17:18.520
thinking about some of the other
 

00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:20.940
thinking about some of the other
powerful things that this API can do so

00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:20.950
powerful things that this API can do so
 

00:17:20.950 --> 00:17:23.640
powerful things that this API can do so
suppose you're you know we're setting up

00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:23.650
suppose you're you know we're setting up
 

00:17:23.650 --> 00:17:25.410
suppose you're you know we're setting up
your flights or your travel information

00:17:25.410 --> 00:17:25.420
your flights or your travel information
 

00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:28.350
your flights or your travel information
to the big Android BBQ and in order to

00:17:28.350 --> 00:17:28.360
to the big Android BBQ and in order to
 

00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:30.090
to the big Android BBQ and in order to
do that you had to of course go to a

00:17:30.090 --> 00:17:30.100
do that you had to of course go to a
 

00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:32.430
do that you had to of course go to a
travel website and probably look up some

00:17:32.430 --> 00:17:32.440
travel website and probably look up some
 

00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:33.810
travel website and probably look up some
flight information and plan an itinerary

00:17:33.810 --> 00:17:33.820
flight information and plan an itinerary
 

00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:35.490
flight information and plan an itinerary
that kind of thing

00:17:35.490 --> 00:17:35.500
that kind of thing
 

00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:36.660
that kind of thing
one of the big ones out there that I

00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:36.670
one of the big ones out there that I
 

00:17:36.670 --> 00:17:38.940
one of the big ones out there that I
like using is Orbitz and we've got them

00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:38.950
like using is Orbitz and we've got them
 

00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:40.800
like using is Orbitz and we've got them
onboard with this API as well and the

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:40.810
onboard with this API as well and the
 

00:17:40.810 --> 00:17:42.270
onboard with this API as well and the
idea here then is that you could start

00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:42.280
idea here then is that you could start
 

00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:43.920
idea here then is that you could start
all of your travel planning do all of

00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:43.930
all of your travel planning do all of
 

00:17:43.930 --> 00:17:46.470
all of your travel planning do all of
your research on mobile on a phone or

00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:46.480
your research on mobile on a phone or
 

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:48.480
your research on mobile on a phone or
tablet and then you can save it and use

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:48.490
tablet and then you can save it and use
 

00:17:48.490 --> 00:17:51.240
tablet and then you can save it and use
it in Chrome or on other platforms but

00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:51.250
it in Chrome or on other platforms but
 

00:17:51.250 --> 00:17:52.950
it in Chrome or on other platforms but
there's more to it than that with this

00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:52.960
there's more to it than that with this
 

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:54.720
there's more to it than that with this
API is actually pretty powerful in that

00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:54.730
API is actually pretty powerful in that
 

00:17:54.730 --> 00:17:56.460
API is actually pretty powerful in that
there's more than just the save and

00:17:56.460 --> 00:17:56.470
there's more than just the save and
 

00:17:56.470 --> 00:17:58.380
there's more than just the save and
retrieve API there's another one that we

00:17:58.380 --> 00:17:58.390
retrieve API there's another one that we
 

00:17:58.390 --> 00:18:01.680
retrieve API there's another one that we
provide also coming out in the update in

00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:01.690
provide also coming out in the update in
 

00:18:01.690 --> 00:18:04.169
provide also coming out in the update in
a in a week or two the version that's

00:18:04.169 --> 00:18:04.179
a in a week or two the version that's
 

00:18:04.179 --> 00:18:05.760
a in a week or two the version that's
rolling out right now it's basically

00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:05.770
rolling out right now it's basically
 

00:18:05.770 --> 00:18:08.220
rolling out right now it's basically
this ability to help the user sign up in

00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:08.230
this ability to help the user sign up in
 

00:18:08.230 --> 00:18:10.740
this ability to help the user sign up in
the first place and so how this works is

00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:10.750
the first place and so how this works is
 

00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:14.039
the first place and so how this works is
basically if the person has saved their

00:18:14.039 --> 00:18:14.049
basically if the person has saved their
 

00:18:14.049 --> 00:18:15.780
basically if the person has saved their
login information for a variety of

00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:15.790
login information for a variety of
 

00:18:15.790 --> 00:18:17.370
login information for a variety of
different apps and sites and they've got

00:18:17.370 --> 00:18:17.380
different apps and sites and they've got
 

00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:19.110
different apps and sites and they've got
a Google account then we know some

00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:19.120
a Google account then we know some
 

00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:20.340
a Google account then we know some
information about them we know which

00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:20.350
information about them we know which
 

00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:22.049
information about them we know which
email addresses they use the different

00:18:22.049 --> 00:18:22.059
email addresses they use the different
 

00:18:22.059 --> 00:18:24.299
email addresses they use the different
ways that they log in and we can present

00:18:24.299 --> 00:18:24.309
ways that they log in and we can present
 

00:18:24.309 --> 00:18:27.360
ways that they log in and we can present
to the end-user basically this dialog at

00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:27.370
to the end-user basically this dialog at
 

00:18:27.370 --> 00:18:29.130
to the end-user basically this dialog at
the time that they need to sign in you

00:18:29.130 --> 00:18:29.140
the time that they need to sign in you
 

00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:31.620
the time that they need to sign in you
can have them pick if your system is

00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:31.630
can have them pick if your system is
 

00:18:31.630 --> 00:18:33.750
can have them pick if your system is
based on email addresses or we're on

00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:33.760
based on email addresses or we're on
 

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:35.549
based on email addresses or we're on
phone numbers basically have them pick

00:18:35.549 --> 00:18:35.559
phone numbers basically have them pick
 

00:18:35.559 --> 00:18:37.560
phone numbers basically have them pick
the information that they need to sign

00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:37.570
the information that they need to sign
 

00:18:37.570 --> 00:18:39.330
the information that they need to sign
in with so the email address that they

00:18:39.330 --> 00:18:39.340
in with so the email address that they
 

00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:41.850
in with so the email address that they
prefer and the nice thing about this if

00:18:41.850 --> 00:18:41.860
prefer and the nice thing about this if
 

00:18:41.860 --> 00:18:43.080
prefer and the nice thing about this if
you've been working with em or

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:43.090
you've been working with em or
 

00:18:43.090 --> 00:18:45.539
you've been working with em or
permissions on marshmallow is that this

00:18:45.539 --> 00:18:45.549
permissions on marshmallow is that this
 

00:18:45.549 --> 00:18:47.940
permissions on marshmallow is that this
dialog calling into the Play services

00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:47.950
dialog calling into the Play services
 

00:18:47.950 --> 00:18:49.950
dialog calling into the Play services
doesn't actually require any device

00:18:49.950 --> 00:18:49.960
doesn't actually require any device
 

00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:51.539
doesn't actually require any device
permissions so now you've got something

00:18:51.539 --> 00:18:51.549
permissions so now you've got something
 

00:18:51.549 --> 00:18:53.039
permissions so now you've got something
very very useful here that you don't

00:18:53.039 --> 00:18:53.049
very very useful here that you don't
 

00:18:53.049 --> 00:18:54.690
very very useful here that you don't
need to ask for get accounts or don't

00:18:54.690 --> 00:18:54.700
need to ask for get accounts or don't
 

00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:56.820
need to ask for get accounts or don't
ask me I need to ask for phone number

00:18:56.820 --> 00:18:56.830
ask me I need to ask for phone number
 

00:18:56.830 --> 00:18:58.620
ask me I need to ask for phone number
permission anymore you can have the user

00:18:58.620 --> 00:18:58.630
permission anymore you can have the user
 

00:18:58.630 --> 00:18:59.940
permission anymore you can have the user
give you that information

00:18:59.940 --> 00:18:59.950
give you that information
 

00:18:59.950 --> 00:19:02.669
give you that information
by calling into a Play services API so

00:19:02.669 --> 00:19:02.679
by calling into a Play services API so
 

00:19:02.679 --> 00:19:04.710
by calling into a Play services API so
they pick that email address and then in

00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:04.720
they pick that email address and then in
 

00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:06.000
they pick that email address and then in
fact if you think about some of the

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:06.010
fact if you think about some of the
 

00:19:06.010 --> 00:19:07.710
fact if you think about some of the
optimizations to your app that you could

00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:07.720
optimizations to your app that you could
 

00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:09.930
optimizations to your app that you could
do you could actually put the user into

00:19:09.930 --> 00:19:09.940
do you could actually put the user into
 

00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:11.760
do you could actually put the user into
the right flow if they're an existing

00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:11.770
the right flow if they're an existing
 

00:19:11.770 --> 00:19:13.710
the right flow if they're an existing
user know that they need to sign back in

00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:13.720
user know that they need to sign back in
 

00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:16.110
user know that they need to sign back in
know how they should be logging in for

00:19:16.110 --> 00:19:16.120
know how they should be logging in for
 

00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:18.419
know how they should be logging in for
that email address for example or you

00:19:18.419 --> 00:19:18.429
that email address for example or you
 

00:19:18.429 --> 00:19:20.130
that email address for example or you
can intelligently put them into a signup

00:19:20.130 --> 00:19:20.140
can intelligently put them into a signup
 

00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:23.640
can intelligently put them into a signup
flow so in the case of this example

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:23.650
flow so in the case of this example
 

00:19:23.650 --> 00:19:27.060
flow so in the case of this example
let's say that we'll just do an account

00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:27.070
let's say that we'll just do an account
 

00:19:27.070 --> 00:19:29.520
let's say that we'll just do an account
creation here or sign in to an existing

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:29.530
creation here or sign in to an existing
 

00:19:29.530 --> 00:19:31.260
creation here or sign in to an existing
account so you have to put in the

00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:31.270
account so you have to put in the
 

00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:34.110
account so you have to put in the
username and the password so let's just

00:19:34.110 --> 00:19:34.120
username and the password so let's just
 

00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:37.409
username and the password so let's just
suppose it's a password account but that

00:19:37.409 --> 00:19:37.419
suppose it's a password account but that
 

00:19:37.419 --> 00:19:39.270
suppose it's a password account but that
said you could do very well the same

00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:39.280
said you could do very well the same
 

00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:41.039
said you could do very well the same
thing for the different types other

00:19:41.039 --> 00:19:41.049
thing for the different types other
 

00:19:41.049 --> 00:19:43.590
thing for the different types other
different types of login that if the

00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:43.600
different types of login that if the
 

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:45.810
different types of login that if the
user were to sign in with Google or with

00:19:45.810 --> 00:19:45.820
user were to sign in with Google or with
 

00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:47.970
user were to sign in with Google or with
Facebook you have that opportunity once

00:19:47.970 --> 00:19:47.980
Facebook you have that opportunity once
 

00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:49.500
Facebook you have that opportunity once
they've entered this information to save

that pointer basically that it was a
 

00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:55.020
that pointer basically that it was a
Facebook or a Google sign-in and that's

00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:55.030
Facebook or a Google sign-in and that's
 

00:19:55.030 --> 00:19:56.549
Facebook or a Google sign-in and that's
what you should trigger the next time so

00:19:56.549 --> 00:19:56.559
what you should trigger the next time so
 

00:19:56.559 --> 00:19:57.990
what you should trigger the next time so
we'll take a look at the how that looks

00:19:57.990 --> 00:19:58.000
we'll take a look at the how that looks
 

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.390
we'll take a look at the how that looks
in a sec but basically at the

00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:00.400
in a sec but basically at the
 

00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:01.380

across all the different platforms it's
 

00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:27.120
across all the different platforms it's
synced to Chrome and then in fact if you

00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:27.130
synced to Chrome and then in fact if you
 

00:20:27.130 --> 00:20:29.730
synced to Chrome and then in fact if you
go to Chrome you can see that

00:20:29.730 --> 00:20:29.740
go to Chrome you can see that
 

00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:31.500
go to Chrome you can see that

now we've been working with the

00:20:47.790 --> 00:20:47.800
now we've been working with the
 

00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:49.740
now we've been working with the
community to basically put a spec out

00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:49.750
community to basically put a spec out
 

00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:52.770
community to basically put a spec out
there a web spec that enables password

00:20:52.770 --> 00:20:52.780
there a web spec that enables password
 

00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:55.020
there a web spec that enables password
management or credential management more

00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:55.030
management or credential management more

generally as a programmatic API in the

00:20:57.270 --> 00:20:57.280
generally as a programmatic API in the
 

00:20:57.280 --> 00:21:00.120
generally as a programmatic API in the
browser so if you read up on the spec

00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:00.130
browser so if you read up on the spec
 

00:21:00.130 --> 00:21:01.650
browser so if you read up on the spec
navigator about credentials you can

00:21:01.650 --> 00:21:01.660
navigator about credentials you can
 

00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:03.510
navigator about credentials you can
check for that available availability of

00:21:03.510 --> 00:21:03.520
check for that available availability of
 

00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:05.160
check for that available availability of
that API in the browser you're using

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:05.170
that API in the browser you're using
 

00:21:05.170 --> 00:21:07.290
that API in the browser you're using
coming to Chrome pretty soon and

00:21:07.290 --> 00:21:07.300
coming to Chrome pretty soon and
 

00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:09.930
coming to Chrome pretty soon and
basically if that API is available then

00:21:09.930 --> 00:21:09.940
basically if that API is available then
 

00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:11.490
basically if that API is available then
you can do the same programmatic

00:21:11.490 --> 00:21:11.500
you can do the same programmatic
 

00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:13.200
you can do the same programmatic
functionality that I've described on

00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:13.210
functionality that I've described on
 

00:21:13.210 --> 00:21:15.450

Android in the browser so imagine going

00:21:15.450 --> 00:21:15.460
Android in the browser so imagine going
 

00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:19.560
Android in the browser so imagine going
from your Android app to the Chrome on

00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:19.570
from your Android app to the Chrome on
 

00:21:19.570 --> 00:21:21.390
from your Android app to the Chrome on
the same device and having those two in

00:21:21.390 --> 00:21:21.400
the same device and having those two in
 

00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:23.100
the same device and having those two in
sync because you know these know the

00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:23.110
sync because you know these know the
 

00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:25.170

another device altogether where this

00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:27.190
another device altogether where this
 

00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:28.650
another device altogether where this
person potentially has never visited

00:21:28.650 --> 00:21:28.660
person potentially has never visited
 

00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:30.810
person potentially has never visited
your site before but since the Google

00:21:30.810 --> 00:21:30.820
your site before but since the Google
 

00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:32.640
your site before but since the Google
account is there you can do an automatic

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:32.650
account is there you can do an automatic
 

00:21:32.650 --> 00:21:34.350
account is there you can do an automatic
sign-in so they could show up through

00:21:34.350 --> 00:21:34.360
sign-in so they could show up through
 

00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:36.120
sign-in so they could show up through
search results something like that and

00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:36.130
search results something like that and
 

00:21:36.130 --> 00:21:37.920
search results something like that and
have a completely seamless experience

00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:37.930
have a completely seamless experience
 

00:21:37.930 --> 00:21:40.170
have a completely seamless experience
and that really highlights one of the

00:21:40.170 --> 00:21:40.180
and that really highlights one of the
 

00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:42.180
and that really highlights one of the
values here that I think makes this

00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:42.190
values here that I think makes this
 

00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:44.850
values here that I think makes this
interesting to Google into the ecosystem

00:21:44.850 --> 00:21:44.860
interesting to Google into the ecosystem
 

00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:48.240
interesting to Google into the ecosystem
as a whole is that this just enables the

as a whole is that this just enables the
 

00:21:48.250 --> 00:21:50.190
as a whole is that this just enables the
the end user who doesn't even really

the end user who doesn't even really
 

00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:51.840
the end user who doesn't even really
understand the concept of saving

00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:51.850
understand the concept of saving
 

00:21:51.850 --> 00:21:53.970
understand the concept of saving
credential information or how it works

00:21:53.970 --> 00:21:53.980
credential information or how it works
 

00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:55.710
credential information or how it works
and just give them the seamless

00:21:55.710 --> 00:21:55.720
and just give them the seamless
 

00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:57.390
and just give them the seamless
experience as they go across the web

00:21:57.390 --> 00:21:57.400
experience as they go across the web
 

00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:58.710
experience as they go across the web
whether they're coming through search

there basically how it works is when the
 

00:23:47.559 --> 00:23:50.190
there basically how it works is when the
app starts you call into the API and you

00:23:50.190 --> 00:23:50.200
app starts you call into the API and you
 

00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:52.649
app starts you call into the API and you
say hey are there any credentials saved

automatic sign-in experience so that's
 

00:24:20.379 --> 00:24:22.500
automatic sign-in experience so that's
pretty cool so what you do is you call

00:25:15.730 --> 00:25:17.100
the scenario where this person logged in
with the password and then you simply

00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:17.110
with the password and then you simply
 

00:25:17.110 --> 00:25:18.659
with the password and then you simply
get the password back and you can

00:25:18.659 --> 00:25:18.669
get the password back and you can
 

00:25:18.669 --> 00:25:20.039
get the password back and you can
imagine the experience for an automatic

00:25:20.039 --> 00:25:20.049
imagine the experience for an automatic
 

00:25:20.049 --> 00:25:21.869
imagine the experience for an automatic
sign-in is basically filling out the

00:25:21.869 --> 00:25:21.879
sign-in is basically filling out the
 

00:25:21.879 --> 00:25:23.399
sign-in is basically filling out the
fields for them and tapping the button

00:25:23.399 --> 00:25:23.409
fields for them and tapping the button
 

00:25:23.409 --> 00:25:24.930
fields for them and tapping the button
but the nice thing there is that you

00:25:24.930 --> 00:25:24.940
but the nice thing there is that you
 

00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:26.519
but the nice thing there is that you
don't even need to show them that UI you

00:25:26.519 --> 00:25:26.529
don't even need to show them that UI you
 

00:25:26.529 --> 00:25:27.690
don't even need to show them that UI you
can hide this behind the splash screen

00:25:27.690 --> 00:25:27.700
can hide this behind the splash screen
 

00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:30.029
can hide this behind the splash screen
of your app and all they see is the nice

00:25:30.029 --> 00:25:30.039
of your app and all they see is the nice
 

00:25:30.039 --> 00:25:31.680
of your app and all they see is the nice
blue bar on top of the splash screen and

00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:31.690
blue bar on top of the splash screen and
 

00:25:31.690 --> 00:25:33.389
blue bar on top of the splash screen and
the the next view that they've got after

00:25:33.389 --> 00:25:33.399
the the next view that they've got after
 

00:25:33.399 --> 00:25:35.669
the the next view that they've got after
that is the signed-in state picking up

00:25:35.669 --> 00:25:35.679
that is the signed-in state picking up
 

00:25:35.679 --> 00:25:37.110
that is the signed-in state picking up
wherever they left off from the last

00:25:37.110 --> 00:25:37.120
wherever they left off from the last
 

00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:40.619
wherever they left off from the last
session or the last device so you have

00:25:40.619 --> 00:25:40.629
session or the last device so you have
 

00:25:40.629 --> 00:25:41.730
session or the last device so you have
to do you think do you think about a

00:25:41.730 --> 00:25:41.740
to do you think do you think about a
 

00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:43.350
to do you think do you think about a
couple of corner cases so one of the

00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:43.360
couple of corner cases so one of the
 

00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:45.119
couple of corner cases so one of the
common ones is if someone has multiple

00:25:45.119 --> 00:25:45.129
common ones is if someone has multiple
 

00:25:45.129 --> 00:25:46.830
common ones is if someone has multiple
credentials saved for example this could

00:25:46.830 --> 00:25:46.840
credentials saved for example this could
 

00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:48.869
credentials saved for example this could
be a shared device where you have

00:25:48.869 --> 00:25:48.879
be a shared device where you have
 

00:25:48.879 --> 00:25:50.930
be a shared device where you have
multiple people signed in they've saved

00:25:50.930 --> 00:25:50.940
multiple people signed in they've saved
 

00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:53.970
multiple people signed in they've saved
information into different accounts and

00:25:53.970 --> 00:25:53.980
information into different accounts and
 

00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:56.190
information into different accounts and
the idea here is that we need to have

00:25:56.190 --> 00:25:56.200
the idea here is that we need to have
 

00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:58.560
the idea here is that we need to have
some disambiguation that one of the the

00:25:58.560 --> 00:25:58.570
some disambiguation that one of the the
 

00:25:58.570 --> 00:26:00.600
some disambiguation that one of the the
person who's seeing this screen the

00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:00.610
person who's seeing this screen the
 

00:26:00.610 --> 00:26:02.730
person who's seeing this screen the
login experience is that they'll

00:26:02.730 --> 00:26:02.740
login experience is that they'll
 

00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:04.799
login experience is that they'll
actually have to pick between the two or

00:26:04.799 --> 00:26:04.809
actually have to pick between the two or
 

00:26:04.809 --> 00:26:07.619
actually have to pick between the two or
more credentials it's also the scenario

00:26:07.619 --> 00:26:07.629
more credentials it's also the scenario
 

00:26:07.629 --> 00:26:10.139
more credentials it's also the scenario
that if they for their account have

00:26:10.139 --> 00:26:10.149
that if they for their account have
 

00:26:10.149 --> 00:26:11.970
that if they for their account have
disabled automatic sign-in one of the

00:26:11.970 --> 00:26:11.980
disabled automatic sign-in one of the
 

00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:14.730
disabled automatic sign-in one of the
Google settings they're not the default

00:26:14.730 --> 00:26:14.740
Google settings they're not the default
 

00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:16.590
Google settings they're not the default
but there are a few people who you know

00:26:16.590 --> 00:26:16.600
but there are a few people who you know
 

00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:18.600
but there are a few people who you know
want to have that level of control which

00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:18.610
want to have that level of control which
 

00:26:18.610 --> 00:26:21.419
want to have that level of control which
is nice be able to pick the credential

00:26:21.419 --> 00:26:21.429
is nice be able to pick the credential
 

00:26:21.429 --> 00:26:23.970
is nice be able to pick the credential
that they want to to sign in with and to

00:26:23.970 --> 00:26:23.980
that they want to to sign in with and to
 

00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:26.190
that they want to to sign in with and to
kind of detect that in in the code that

00:26:26.190 --> 00:26:26.200
kind of detect that in in the code that
 

00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:28.080
kind of detect that in in the code that
you write you basically just check for

00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:28.090
you write you basically just check for
 

00:26:28.090 --> 00:26:30.299
you write you basically just check for
this state resolution required in the

00:26:30.299 --> 00:26:30.309
this state resolution required in the
 

00:26:30.309 --> 00:26:33.029
this state resolution required in the
result that you get back if it's

00:26:33.029 --> 00:26:33.039
result that you get back if it's
 

00:26:33.039 --> 00:26:34.619
result that you get back if it's
resolution required then you can fire

00:26:34.619 --> 00:26:34.629
resolution required then you can fire
 

00:26:34.629 --> 00:26:36.570
resolution required then you can fire
off an intent at whatever point in your

00:26:36.570 --> 00:26:36.580
off an intent at whatever point in your
 

00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:39.119
off an intent at whatever point in your
UI fits in and then the idea is that

00:26:39.119 --> 00:26:39.129
UI fits in and then the idea is that
 

00:26:39.129 --> 00:26:40.940
UI fits in and then the idea is that
you'll be called back when the user

00:26:40.940 --> 00:26:40.950
you'll be called back when the user
 

00:26:40.950 --> 00:26:43.100
you'll be called back when the user
one of the safe credentials or they

00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:43.110
one of the safe credentials or they
 

00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:44.389
one of the safe credentials or they
could very well cancel and you know

00:26:44.389 --> 00:26:44.399
could very well cancel and you know
 

00:26:44.399 --> 00:26:47.320
could very well cancel and you know
create a new account something like that

00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:47.330
create a new account something like that
 

00:26:47.330 --> 00:26:50.149
create a new account something like that
so then under the scenario that there's

00:26:50.149 --> 00:26:50.159
so then under the scenario that there's
 

00:26:50.159 --> 00:26:51.710
so then under the scenario that there's
nothing saved in the API you have to

00:26:51.710 --> 00:26:51.720
nothing saved in the API you have to
 

00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:53.480
nothing saved in the API you have to
think kind of going back to that Orbitz

00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:53.490
think kind of going back to that Orbitz
 

00:26:53.490 --> 00:26:55.669
think kind of going back to that Orbitz
example that we talked about that what

00:26:55.669 --> 00:26:55.679
example that we talked about that what
 

00:26:55.679 --> 00:26:57.830
example that we talked about that what
do you do if there's nothing saved and a

00:26:57.830 --> 00:26:57.840
do you do if there's nothing saved and a
 

00:26:57.840 --> 00:26:59.930
do you do if there's nothing saved and a
nice thing here is just is that this is

00:26:59.930 --> 00:26:59.940
nice thing here is just is that this is
 

00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:02.629
nice thing here is just is that this is
just a API on top of whatever you've

00:27:02.629 --> 00:27:02.639
just a API on top of whatever you've
 

00:27:02.639 --> 00:27:04.610
just a API on top of whatever you've
already built so basically you could

00:27:04.610 --> 00:27:04.620
already built so basically you could
 

00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:06.409
already built so basically you could
very well just operate in the scenario

00:27:06.409 --> 00:27:06.419
very well just operate in the scenario
 

00:27:06.419 --> 00:27:08.690
very well just operate in the scenario
that this API were not there that the

00:27:08.690 --> 00:27:08.700
that this API were not there that the
 

00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:10.340
that this API were not there that the
user is going to have to manually select

00:27:10.340 --> 00:27:10.350
user is going to have to manually select
 

00:27:10.350 --> 00:27:12.529
user is going to have to manually select
or input their login information and

00:27:12.529 --> 00:27:12.539
or input their login information and
 

00:27:12.539 --> 00:27:15.230
or input their login information and
this is works out perfectly well that

00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:15.240
this is works out perfectly well that
 

00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:17.269
this is works out perfectly well that
it's it's certainly not a loss of what

00:27:17.269 --> 00:27:17.279
it's it's certainly not a loss of what
 

00:27:17.279 --> 00:27:19.340
it's it's certainly not a loss of what
anything that you currently had but now

00:27:19.340 --> 00:27:19.350
anything that you currently had but now
 

00:27:19.350 --> 00:27:20.570
anything that you currently had but now
you've got a couple of opportunities

00:27:20.570 --> 00:27:20.580
you've got a couple of opportunities
 

00:27:20.580 --> 00:27:23.870
you've got a couple of opportunities
here one is that you can check in this

00:27:23.870 --> 00:27:23.880
here one is that you can check in this
 

00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:27.230
here one is that you can check in this
state that if it's valuable you can use

00:27:27.230 --> 00:27:27.240
state that if it's valuable you can use
 

00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:29.389
state that if it's valuable you can use
that picker I showed earlier that you

00:27:29.389 --> 00:27:29.399
that picker I showed earlier that you
 

00:27:29.399 --> 00:27:32.269
that picker I showed earlier that you
can have them tap with with with one

00:27:32.269 --> 00:27:32.279
can have them tap with with with one
 

00:27:32.279 --> 00:27:35.330
can have them tap with with with one
action the identifier that they need the

00:27:35.330 --> 00:27:35.340
action the identifier that they need the
 

00:27:35.340 --> 00:27:37.370
action the identifier that they need the
email address or the phone number and

00:27:37.370 --> 00:27:37.380
email address or the phone number and
 

00:27:37.380 --> 00:27:39.230
email address or the phone number and
use that to bootstrap the sign-in

00:27:39.230 --> 00:27:39.240
use that to bootstrap the sign-in
 

00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:40.730
use that to bootstrap the sign-in
process or you could just use the

00:27:40.730 --> 00:27:40.740
process or you could just use the
 

00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:42.350
process or you could just use the
existing flow and if you go through the

00:27:42.350 --> 00:27:42.360
existing flow and if you go through the
 

00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:46.460
existing flow and if you go through the
existing flow then you have the

00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:46.470
existing flow then you have the
 

00:27:46.470 --> 00:27:48.500
existing flow then you have the
opportunity after they've entered login

00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:48.510
opportunity after they've entered login
 

00:27:48.510 --> 00:27:50.360
opportunity after they've entered login
information and you validated that it's

00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:50.370
information and you validated that it's
 

00:27:50.370 --> 00:27:52.279
information and you validated that it's
correct you have the opportunity to

00:27:52.279 --> 00:27:52.289
correct you have the opportunity to
 

00:27:52.289 --> 00:27:53.840
correct you have the opportunity to
present them with that save dialog we

00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:53.850
present them with that save dialog we
 

00:27:53.850 --> 00:27:55.549
present them with that save dialog we
showed earlier and then once this

00:27:55.549 --> 00:27:55.559
showed earlier and then once this
 

00:27:55.559 --> 00:27:58.009
showed earlier and then once this
information is saved then next time they

00:27:58.009 --> 00:27:58.019
information is saved then next time they
 

00:27:58.019 --> 00:27:59.570
information is saved then next time they
come back they'll be able to do the

00:27:59.570 --> 00:27:59.580
come back they'll be able to do the
 

00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:00.139
come back they'll be able to do the
automatic

00:28:00.139 --> 00:28:00.149
automatic
 

00:28:00.149 --> 00:28:02.299
automatic
sign-in and in fact like I mentioned

00:28:02.299 --> 00:28:02.309
sign-in and in fact like I mentioned
 

00:28:02.309 --> 00:28:03.799
sign-in and in fact like I mentioned
earlier we had some big names there and

00:28:03.799 --> 00:28:03.809
earlier we had some big names there and
 

00:28:03.809 --> 00:28:05.330
earlier we had some big names there and
the performance on those apps has just

00:28:05.330 --> 00:28:05.340
the performance on those apps has just
 

00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:08.450
the performance on those apps has just
been really fantastic so for Netflix for

00:28:08.450 --> 00:28:08.460
been really fantastic so for Netflix for
 

00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:10.940
been really fantastic so for Netflix for
example huge hundred million users plus

00:28:10.940 --> 00:28:10.950
example huge hundred million users plus
 

00:28:10.950 --> 00:28:13.070
example huge hundred million users plus
they see in the order of thirty or forty

00:28:13.070 --> 00:28:13.080
they see in the order of thirty or forty
 

00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:14.450
they see in the order of thirty or forty
percent of their users being signed in

00:28:14.450 --> 00:28:14.460
percent of their users being signed in
 

00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:17.090
percent of their users being signed in
automatically with this that's that's a

00:28:17.090 --> 00:28:17.100
automatically with this that's that's a
 

00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:20.269
automatically with this that's that's a
complete change that those users you can

00:28:20.269 --> 00:28:20.279
complete change that those users you can
 

00:28:20.279 --> 00:28:22.490
complete change that those users you can
imagine are now reducing by basically

00:28:22.490 --> 00:28:22.500
imagine are now reducing by basically
 

00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:24.289
imagine are now reducing by basically
the same proportion all of their failed

00:28:24.289 --> 00:28:24.299
the same proportion all of their failed
 

00:28:24.299 --> 00:28:26.720
the same proportion all of their failed
login attempts so by incorporating a

00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:26.730

couple of lines of code into your apps

00:28:28.159 --> 00:28:28.169
couple of lines of code into your apps

letting it run for a little while to
 

00:28:29.970 --> 00:28:32.720
letting it run for a little while to
collect you know the login information

00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:32.730
collect you know the login information
 

00:28:32.730 --> 00:28:34.940
collect you know the login information
from Android sign ends you're now

00:28:34.940 --> 00:28:34.950
from Android sign ends you're now
 

00:28:34.950 --> 00:28:36.200
from Android sign ends you're now
getting your users into a state where

00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:36.210
getting your users into a state where
 

00:28:36.210 --> 00:28:37.549
getting your users into a state where
they can be signed in automatically

00:28:37.549 --> 00:28:37.559
they can be signed in automatically
 

00:28:37.559 --> 00:28:40.310
they can be signed in automatically
almost half of the time and half of the

00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:40.320
almost half of the time and half of the
 

00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:42.080
almost half of the time and half of the
time will ultimately be the steady state

00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:42.090
time will ultimately be the steady state
 

00:28:42.090 --> 00:28:44.299
time will ultimately be the steady state
because when someone sees one of those

00:28:44.299 --> 00:28:44.309
because when someone sees one of those
 

00:28:44.309 --> 00:28:46.370
because when someone sees one of those
save dialogues we have in fact the

00:28:46.370 --> 00:28:46.380
save dialogues we have in fact the
 

00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:48.799
save dialogues we have in fact the
majority of people opt in to save so so

00:28:48.799 --> 00:28:48.809
majority of people opt in to save so so
 

00:28:48.809 --> 00:28:50.539
majority of people opt in to save so so
long as they have set up an account or

00:28:50.539 --> 00:28:50.549
long as they have set up an account or
 

00:28:50.549 --> 00:28:52.700
long as they have set up an account or
have signed in at least once they'll get

00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:52.710
have signed in at least once they'll get
 

00:28:52.710 --> 00:28:55.280
have signed in at least once they'll get
into that state and I think ultimately

00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:55.290
into that state and I think ultimately
 

00:28:55.290 --> 00:28:57.890
into that state and I think ultimately
where we see the kind of steady state

00:28:57.890 --> 00:28:57.900
where we see the kind of steady state
 

00:28:57.900 --> 00:28:59.900
where we see the kind of steady state
balance between chrome and Android being

is is the majority being originally
saved on Android so the idea being that

00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:05.610
saved on Android so the idea being that
 

00:29:05.610 --> 00:29:07.940
saved on Android so the idea being that
everyone who logs in on Android is shown

everyone who logs in on Android is shown
that prompt

00:29:08.660 --> 00:29:08.670
that prompt
 

00:29:08.670 --> 00:29:10.610
that prompt
it's a modal dialogue opt-in rates are

00:29:10.610 --> 00:29:10.620
it's a modal dialogue opt-in rates are
 

00:29:10.620 --> 00:29:12.680
it's a modal dialogue opt-in rates are
very good and the Android Android

00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:12.690
very good and the Android Android
 

00:29:12.690 --> 00:29:14.570
very good and the Android Android
scenario of user going from one device

00:29:14.570 --> 00:29:14.580
scenario of user going from one device
 

00:29:14.580 --> 00:29:16.970
scenario of user going from one device
to another either getting a new device

00:29:16.970 --> 00:29:16.980
to another either getting a new device
 

00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:19.870

moving between devices signing out

00:29:19.870 --> 00:29:19.880
moving between devices signing out
 

00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:22.430
moving between devices signing out
restoring the app something like that is

00:29:22.430 --> 00:29:22.440
restoring the app something like that is
 

00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:24.380
restoring the app something like that is
very powerful and will be a very common

00:29:24.380 --> 00:29:24.390
very powerful and will be a very common
 

00:29:24.390 --> 00:29:26.180
very powerful and will be a very common
case so even if you only do Android

00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:26.190
case so even if you only do Android
 

00:29:26.190 --> 00:29:27.350
case so even if you only do Android
development it's worth thinking about

00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:27.360
development it's worth thinking about
 

00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:29.990
development it's worth thinking about
this but that said if you do have a

00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:30.000
this but that said if you do have a
 

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.210
this but that said if you do have a
website it's worth putting the two

00:29:32.210 --> 00:29:32.220
website it's worth putting the two
 

00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:33.410
website it's worth putting the two
together so that they can share

00:29:33.410 --> 00:29:33.420
together so that they can share
 

00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:34.850
together so that they can share
credentials and in order to do that

00:29:34.850 --> 00:29:34.860
credentials and in order to do that
 

00:29:34.860 --> 00:29:36.080
credentials and in order to do that
there's a couple of steps in our

00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:36.090
there's a couple of steps in our
 

00:29:36.090 --> 00:29:37.970
there's a couple of steps in our
developer documentation but the general

00:29:37.970 --> 00:29:37.980
developer documentation but the general
 

00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:40.430
developer documentation but the general
idea here is that in order to ensure the

00:29:40.430 --> 00:29:40.440
idea here is that in order to ensure the
 

00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:42.620
idea here is that in order to ensure the
security of this of this connection you

00:29:42.620 --> 00:29:42.630
security of this of this connection you
 

00:29:42.630 --> 00:29:44.630
security of this of this connection you
assert ownership of the website that

00:29:44.630 --> 00:29:44.640
assert ownership of the website that
 

00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:47.120
assert ownership of the website that
you've got the one of the requirements

00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:47.130
you've got the one of the requirements
 

00:29:47.130 --> 00:29:50.270
you've got the one of the requirements
is that you have an HTTP site so just to

00:29:50.270 --> 00:29:50.280
is that you have an HTTP site so just to
 

00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:52.160
is that you have an HTTP site so just to
ensure that everything that's stored

00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:52.170
ensure that everything that's stored
 

00:29:52.170 --> 00:29:55.000
ensure that everything that's stored
there or retrieved there can be securely

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:55.010
there or retrieved there can be securely
 

00:29:55.010 --> 00:29:57.980
there or retrieved there can be securely
passed to the user the general idea that

00:29:57.980 --> 00:29:57.990
passed to the user the general idea that
 

00:29:57.990 --> 00:30:00.080
passed to the user the general idea that
you assert ownership over your HTTP

00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:00.090
you assert ownership over your HTTP
 

00:30:00.090 --> 00:30:02.090
you assert ownership over your HTTP
website and then once you've got that

00:30:02.090 --> 00:30:02.100
website and then once you've got that
 

00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:03.950
website and then once you've got that
you go into the Play Developer console

00:30:03.950 --> 00:30:03.960
you go into the Play Developer console
 

00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:05.870
you go into the Play Developer console
and basically say that your app is

00:30:05.870 --> 00:30:05.880
and basically say that your app is
 

00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:07.910
and basically say that your app is
associated to that website and then with

00:30:07.910 --> 00:30:07.920
associated to that website and then with
 

00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:10.220
associated to that website and then with
that link made we can basically have the

00:30:10.220 --> 00:30:10.230
that link made we can basically have the
 

00:30:10.230 --> 00:30:12.650
that link made we can basically have the
credentials stored in either location be

00:30:12.650 --> 00:30:12.660
credentials stored in either location be
 

00:30:12.660 --> 00:30:14.330
credentials stored in either location be
available when the API is called in

00:30:14.330 --> 00:30:14.340
available when the API is called in
 

00:30:14.340 --> 00:30:16.580
available when the API is called in

in the current version of Play services
 

00:30:18.540 --> 00:30:20.810
in the current version of Play services
so that's pretty cool experience

00:30:20.810 --> 00:30:20.820
so that's pretty cool experience
 

00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:22.460
so that's pretty cool experience
I think that really sums up what's

00:30:22.460 --> 00:30:22.470
I think that really sums up what's
 

00:30:22.470 --> 00:30:25.370
I think that really sums up what's
possible here and I think that if you

00:30:25.370 --> 00:30:25.380
possible here and I think that if you
 

00:30:25.380 --> 00:30:27.350
possible here and I think that if you
look at how it's been doing so far I

00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:27.360
look at how it's been doing so far I
 

00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:29.690
look at how it's been doing so far I
think one of the main points are the

00:30:29.690 --> 00:30:29.700
think one of the main points are the
 

00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:31.010
think one of the main points are the
stories that I'd like to tell is that

00:30:31.010 --> 00:30:31.020
stories that I'd like to tell is that
 

00:30:31.020 --> 00:30:34.220
stories that I'd like to tell is that
this is not just an API for kind of the

00:30:34.220 --> 00:30:34.230
this is not just an API for kind of the
 

00:30:34.230 --> 00:30:35.690
this is not just an API for kind of the
people who know what a password manager

00:30:35.690 --> 00:30:35.700
people who know what a password manager
 

00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:38.270
people who know what a password manager
is but in fact an API for anybody on

00:30:38.270 --> 00:30:38.280
is but in fact an API for anybody on
 

00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:41.060
is but in fact an API for anybody on
Android that in reality with some of the

00:30:41.060 --> 00:30:41.070
Android that in reality with some of the
 

00:30:41.070 --> 00:30:42.530
Android that in reality with some of the
big apps that have launched already we

00:30:42.530 --> 00:30:42.540
big apps that have launched already we
 

00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:45.050
big apps that have launched already we
have over 300 million downloads of the

00:30:45.050 --> 00:30:45.060
have over 300 million downloads of the
 

00:30:45.060 --> 00:30:47.480
have over 300 million downloads of the
of apps enabled with this API and we've

00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:47.490
of apps enabled with this API and we've
 

00:30:47.490 --> 00:30:49.400
of apps enabled with this API and we've
had 50 million people in just a few

00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:49.410
had 50 million people in just a few
 

00:30:49.410 --> 00:30:51.830
had 50 million people in just a few
months save or retrieve some kind of

00:30:51.830 --> 00:30:51.840
months save or retrieve some kind of
 

00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:53.600
months save or retrieve some kind of
login information and if you think about

00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:53.610
login information and if you think about
 

00:30:53.610 --> 00:30:56.000
login information and if you think about
that number that's more than any of the

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:56.010
that number that's more than any of the
 

00:30:56.010 --> 00:30:58.130
that number that's more than any of the
password managers on Android have ever

00:30:58.130 --> 00:30:58.140
password managers on Android have ever
 

00:30:58.140 --> 00:31:00.290
password managers on Android have ever
been downloaded in the first place

00:31:00.290 --> 00:31:00.300
been downloaded in the first place
 

00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:02.930
been downloaded in the first place
so this is really aiming to be the login

00:31:02.930 --> 00:31:02.940
so this is really aiming to be the login
 

00:31:02.940 --> 00:31:05.690
so this is really aiming to be the login
solution for everyone that it's a state

00:31:05.690 --> 00:31:05.700
solution for everyone that it's a state
 

00:31:05.700 --> 00:31:07.670
solution for everyone that it's a state
or in a user experience where people

00:31:07.670 --> 00:31:07.680
or in a user experience where people
 

00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:08.840
or in a user experience where people
don't even have to think

00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:08.850
don't even have to think
 

00:31:08.850 --> 00:31:10.760
don't even have to think
about password management or login

00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:10.770
about password management or login
 

00:31:10.770 --> 00:31:12.350
about password management or login
management they just do whatever they

00:31:12.350 --> 00:31:12.360
management they just do whatever they
 

00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:13.790
management they just do whatever they
need to do they save that information

00:31:13.790 --> 00:31:13.800
need to do they save that information
 

00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:15.680
need to do they save that information
and they get in a state where they never

00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:15.690
and they get in a state where they never
 

00:31:15.690 --> 00:31:18.200
and they get in a state where they never
need to see or manage that information

00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:18.210
need to see or manage that information
 

00:31:18.210 --> 00:31:20.330
need to see or manage that information
again they'll just be signed in so
