00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:02.639
Do you remember your first crush?

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.580
Maybe you're finding yourself very attracted
to someone at the moment.

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:11.039
Attraction is something most of us experienced
throughout our lives and crushes can be incredibly

00:00:11.039 --> 00:00:12.589
powerful.

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:17.369
Maybe you're wondering if someone has a crush
on you or how to attract that special someone.

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.300
If so, watch on for 8 psychological facts
about crushes.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:27.140
One; prolonged eye contact can increase attraction
to your crush.

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:33.730
Kellerman, Laird, al 1989 decided to look
at the effect eye contact can have on how

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:35.579
much we like someone.

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.280
They had strangers engage in mutual gaze,
looking at each other in the eye and then

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.250
had the participants rate each other.

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:47.360
They found that this prolonged eye contact
increased attraction and attachment to the

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:48.360
stranger.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.260
So, if you want to appear more attractive
to your crush, be sure to look them in the

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.260
eye.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.090
Two; opposites do attract.

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.140
We've all heard the saying "opposites attract"
but is there any truth to it.

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:05.270
Kromer, Hummel, Croy et al, 2016, looked into
this saying.

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:10.409
They specifically looked at genetic blueprints
known as HLA complexes.

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.930
They found that women were naturally more
attracted to those with different HLA complexes

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.500
to themselves.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.270
It would seem therefore that opposites do
indeed attract and who you crush on, could

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.270
come down to different genetic blueprints.

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.530
Three; children with older parents fancy older
people when they become adults.

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.370
Do you know someone who always seemed to have
a crush on someone older than themselves?

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:50.280
Someone who always seems to have an age gap
in their relationships?

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.200
Some research has suggested this could be
due to parental age.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.220
One study found an association between a child's
parents being older and them finding older

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.430
faces more attractive when they are adults.

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.790
So, if you find you're always crushing on
someone older, it could be because of your

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:06.790
parents.

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:11.230
Four; those with symmetrical faces tend to
be more attractive.

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.739
So, what is it that actually make someone
attractive?

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:18.250
Why is it that some people have loads of admirers?

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.849
It seems to be that our brains are wired in
a way that finds certain things more attractive.

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:29.129
One constant across a wide range of people
seems to be that faces which are symmetrical

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:30.959
are rated as attractive.

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.620
Does your crush have a symmetrical face?

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.950
That could be why you find them attractive.

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.590
Five; sound and smell play a role in attraction.

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:44.239
It seems fairly obvious to say sight plays
a role in attraction, we tend to attribute

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:47.489
our initial attraction to someone to how they
look.

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:50.439
However, it isn't the only sense that matters.

00:02:50.439 --> 00:02:55.739
It has also been found that both sound and
smell also have a part to play in a crush

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:56.739
developing.

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:01.440
Specifically, it seems that a person's voice
and their scent are important to that initial

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:02.689
attraction.

00:03:02.689 --> 00:03:07.110
This makes sense, as along with how they look,
these two factors are things you perceive

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.389
very quickly when meeting someone.

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:13.580
So, although you may not realize, it could
be more than just your crushes looks that

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.160
you're attracted to.

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.860
Six; we're attracted to those of similar Heights
to us.

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:25.190
It has been found in various studies that
couples Heights are often positively correlated.

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.810
This means that taller individuals on average
end up with taller partners.

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.249
But why is this?

00:03:31.249 --> 00:03:34.450
Is it environmentally learned or is it genetic?

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:40.140
Tenesa et al, 2016, decided to look into this
question.

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:45.400
Using advanced statistical techniques, they
managed to find that choice mate height, meaning

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:50.390
that height of our partner was due, at least
in part, to genetic factors.

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:55.420
So, if your crush is a similar height to you,
this is probably due to genetics.

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:00.390
Seven; the color red makes woman more attractive
to men.

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:05.370
Red is often associated with attraction and
desire, but is there any other reasons for

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:06.370
this?

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:11.790
One study looked at the effects color had
on heterosexual men's judgment on the attractiveness

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.580
of several women.

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:17.620
It found that red made men think women were
more attractive.

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:23.380
They suggested this is due to social conditioning,
because society associates red with passion,

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:24.970
so did these participants.

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:30.060
The study only looked at heterosexual attraction,
and so, it's unclear whether the same effect

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:33.180
would be found in the same-sex attraction.

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.320
Eight; falling in love causes psychological
changes.

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:41.950
Falling in love is a powerful thing which
has a profound effect on us.

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:45.980
It's been found it has a lot of psychological
changes on the body.

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:50.090
It releases chemicals which have the effect
of making us feel good.

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:55.290
Our cheeks blush pink, our palms sweat and
our heart race.

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:58.920
Have you ever noticed these changes when you
talk to your crush?

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:03.130
