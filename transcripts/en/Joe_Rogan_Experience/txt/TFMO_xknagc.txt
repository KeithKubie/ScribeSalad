No. But um, the, uh, the regular ones, we're going to have the cheap, we're going to have not cheap, high quality, best quality available, but they're going to be inexpensive. We're trying to make kettle bells as cheap as possible, but the best quality possible and only sell it on the Internet and they see if you, if you can work out a deal with shipping, I think we can make them very reasonable because I think everybody's trying to make money. You should make them smell like blueberries or something. Great. So that's working out. It smells like vanilla. Doesn't help dudes, Bro. That only helps you. That would help you sit down and just start smelling. All is working out, but it smelled like vanilla. Come here. If you'd call your girlfriend, honey, come here. It smells like vanilla.

Speaker 4:          00:04:47       [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:04:54       what happened was all that speed thing I was playing around while you're experimenting with you fucking freaky. One of my good friends in the music business, one of the coolest motherfuckers I know and one of the dudes that, you know, when I think about like wow, I'm friends, whatever the last, it might not be a big deal to you cause you're Everlast but when I was a fan of house of pain, you know, when I first moved to California, you know, it's, to me it's just cool as fuck to sit here and carry it with you.

Speaker 3:          00:05:23       I appreciate that man. Ay, Yo, I got to also say, man, last time I came over here, we joked around about my Twitter. There was like 6,000 people on it, man. There's like 16,000 now and I swear to God, at least nine of those 10,000 came straight from this show. I'm sure. Well they didn't know. You know, you're, it's, Oh gee. Everlast folks, if those of you are looking for them, cause I'm sure there's about a fake mountains. I don't know. I don't, I I, there must be, there's, there's a whole bunch that it's hard finding someone on, on, on Twitter. That's correct. It's a real person actually got one of those little check marks recently. Me. I'm actually

Speaker 2:          00:05:58       mean now. Yeah, that's tricky. You got to get those. I look for the most positive munch of people I've ever seen. The from the Joe Rogan podcast podcasts. You know, it's crazy, isn't it? I was waiting for like, you suck you're in. And I was like, you know, I was, inevitably someone asks, it wasn't none of that. It was crazy. Amazingly Nice. It's the craziest group of people. Uh, you know, I had a guy came up to me to this show this weekend and the dude was actually crying. He had tears in his eyes and he said that one of our podcasts will, we're me and Brian Cowen, we're talking about what's wrong with you when you're a hater, what it's really all about. It's really all about this being dissatisfied with yourself. And then you look at someone and you try to chop them down or you try to attack the attack their weaknesses or find their flaws.

Speaker 2:          00:06:42       But really what most of that is comes from is a real, a feeling of unease about your own life. And absolutely it's all of it. And this guy said that it changed his life. He said he literally stopped behaving that way. He goes, I realize what I was doing because I realize what I was doing right there. Cause I never, he goes, I was just an asshole. I didn't even know why I was an asshole. I couldn't help being an asshole. He goes, but just spelling that out that it was really all just me being frustrated about myself. He goes, I couldn't see that without you pointing it out. But now I see it so clear. It's changed my life. He's like, it just opened the door that I can never shut again. In any case, Dan, he gave me a little tongue reached, even don't realize you're, your brain is extremely kind.

Speaker 2:          00:07:25       Yeah. If there's something that's bothering it, it'll tuck it behind anything it can and just tell you to ignore it. Yeah. Yeah. And sometimes it's easy to just moving a chair out the way and be like, Homey, look, yeah, that's why you're upset. The did you wrong? You know, are almost always right. The mind is incredibly complex and none of us have a guidebook for it. That's a real problem. Nobody really, you know, you can join a religion or you could join us, you know, a cult or maybe, you know, become a monk or something and they give you some guidelines. You could do it their way, but that might not be the way you know, it's the, the way is your way could be different than I ways. A lot of Goddamn way. A lot of ways. But there's principles that you need to get through like truth and honesty and kindness.

Speaker 2:          00:08:10       They sound weak. You know, we talked about this last time that it takes a lot of strength to be a loving person, to just be open and loving. You have to expose yourself and it sounds, you know, the insecure people don't, don't want to think like that. They want to think there's something wrong with them while you fucking queer. What are you talking love? You know, that's ridiculous. You don't want more love in your life. Everybody should want more love. It doesn't mean you're weak. It doesn't mean your wife's and usually more than anybody else. Yeah, I know. Almost always then they don't know that everybody can see it. You know? Cause I've been that dude. I've been that angry dude and didn't know that everybody could see like, what the fuck is wrong with you, man? Why you so tightly wound? Why? Why? You know, why are you looking at smack people?

Speaker 2:          00:08:50       What the fuck is that all about? Well, it's always some shit that has almost nothing to do with what's going on right in front of you. Yeah. I mean, shit, I'm 42 man, and I've probably only figured it out nine months ago. I think I figured it out last week. I don't know, man. I take a, it comes and goes. I think that, uh, any, any real feeling of figuring anything out to me, it's always like real fleeting and I never feel confident enough to even say I figured out ever. You know, it's always, to me, it's always just, I'm, I'm just trying to keep my fucking head above water like everybody else. Just trying to not only retain, maintain, be nice and joy. There's no mastery of this fucking thing. This is a ride, right? We're on top of a fucking seven mile high wave man.

Speaker 2:          00:09:35       Just because the boat is turn the correct direction doesn't mean we have any control of this. Fuck. You know, you get a good no, no control of this crazy life. You just gotta enjoy. Try to ride that wave as best you can and try to do the best you can to enhance your environment and enjoy what you've got. Yeah. Enhance your environment. Hence your friendships, you know. Right. The absolutely. That sounds like a Goddamn Everlast song is, you know, I'm gonna make you cry today man. I bet you well, you were making me cry when you're warming up, man. I had to go out and take a shit. I was like, I might have to drop some weight here. This is too good.

I've, uh, I haven't been over there, but I've hung out with a lot of those guys on the basis when we do UFC shows, military shows, man, fucking tough life, man. Different breed of folk, man. Yeah. God bless him. And we wouldn't exist without them. Yeah. We wouldn't exist without them. I just don't like the people that are putting them in places that aren't absolutely. Well, I

Speaker 9:          00:14:52       mean, I was brought over there and like I had just released an album that was very vehemently making statements against like the administration and, and yeah. And the war. But it, when I was invited over there,

Speaker 10:         00:15:03       mmm.

Speaker 9:          00:15:05       Uh, you know, nope. They didn't ask me about any written out. And I, and I really, you know, I look at is most of these cats was trying to get some college money and said, you know, I believe in something too.

Speaker 2:          00:15:16       Well that's what it used to be. I mean, that's when, when Pat Tillman signed up, that's what he did. He left the NFL. Yeah. He was like, you know what, I believe in this. This is real. You know, our country's being attacked. Then when he got over there, he was one of the biggest critics of the war ever. Once he got over there, him and his brother, I mean his, his brother doesn't even believe it was friendly fire. Yeah. It was, brother thinks they had him killed, I believe and own that. And He, I mean, they covered up this whole story about friendly fire, you know? Yeah. They pretend to remember died in war, you know, by the time he was over there, he just, he realized what a cluster fuck it was. The whole thing is a mess, man. It's uh, the people behind it though, the people that you know, are, we're willing to sign up and beat and be heroes and really go and fight the enemy in their mind. I mean, that's an incredibly brave thing. And then this, which is the most fucked up thing about it is the idea that brave people get manipulated

Speaker 9:          00:16:10       in the, in the name of money. And I was, you know, what it was shocking to me was how young these cats were and how much responsibility, like carried on their shoulders. And I thought about myself at 22 or 24 in, this guy's running a squad of tanks and I was like, you know, you know, probably passed out drunk in a bar, so sure. You know what I mean? Triple. It was like, you know, you've just given do, I went out there and there they were. I mean, it was like the most appreciative. Like you, Dave, thank you so much. Just for going unused. Just bananas. I was like, I was, I was privileged to going. I'd go back in a heartbeat.

Speaker 2:          00:16:50       She's so scary to be over there. Let's go. So scary to be in such a fucked up place in the world. It's, you know, most people that live in this side live in Nice cities, drive nice cars, you know, exist in a peaceful state of harmony. We're barely even aware that there's some people that mostly financially and fortunate at this point, mostly just not a lot of fucking opportunities where they live at this point and they're getting shipped off to some crazy country on the other side of the world is just filled with death and despair. Like most people don't even know. Like, you know this guy that snapped recently and kill those people in Afghanistan. You don't have a story. Hey Dude, like three tours, tours. Not only that, but he thought he was gonna get off combat duty. They were, they were dangling it over his head.

Speaker 2:          00:17:36       He was losing his house back home. And I'm, you know, I'm not making any excuses for this guy, but the day of his, he watched one of his friends get his legs blown off. Well, and then I guess he just snapped. He doesn't even remember it. He went where? He says he doesn't remember it. Who knows? But what did they, they're, they manipulate the fuck out of these people, man. I know what do to Ed? Only 20 days left on a 20 year bid. What? The Army Reserve and then with 20 days left, he was going to retire. They sent him to Iraq for a year and a half. They can just do that. They send them back again to, and once they send you once, they can send you again, like you literally worked for them forever. You cannot quit. There is no tie. They somewhere in the day for sure.

Speaker 2:          00:18:19       Habitation option. That's insanity. And option B, what out? The fact that we allow that man, that's really fucked up. That's, that's uh, that's uh, I'll tell you like this, I'm honestly, you know, and if I was young, I'd still be saying this, you know, I ain't saying it cause I'm past whatever age, but I think to a certain degree it should be you turn 18, you want to like have certain privileges in this country, you should go do your two years service. And you know what I mean? Change a lot of Shit I'll tell you which cause yeah, cause every senate, his kid would be in there, every, every governor and the residents kid would have to do it. It's, you know, you know, but that'll never happen. You're right. Yeah. You know, uh, I think in principle then we'd have a standing army at all times of what, 15 million people? Christ more than that. Right. And they know how many young people do we have of that. Yeah. I would probably be, what do we have now? I bet it's probably 15 million now. How many people are in the army? Seven. A number of US military. How many times have you been over there? A once, but I'll go back any day now while you like me have a daughter, doesn't that uh, that's when you see like dudes who have daughters. My wife wasn't about you being over there am I believe my wife was pregnant when I went. Wow. Yeah.

Speaker 11:         00:19:38       You know, it's weird, Joe, that you, uh, I was listening to some old Howard Stern's. I don't really have you been listening to the Kinison and shit and somebody said something on the Howard stern show and he was like, is that true? But he didn't have a computer to like go like how many people in the military? So I was just thinking like, how weird is that? Like Howard had no idea. There was no way for him to check that at all. So you just pretty much was like, all right, I guess I have to believe this. You can talk all kinds of crazy shit back then. Yeah. Yeah. That's good shit though. All Week he's having Sam Kinison on.

Speaker 2:          00:20:04       Yeah, I listened to it today. It's crazy. From 1988. It's weird. You know, it's when I first started doing comedy. Yeah. And because of Sam Kennison too. There was the first dude that I ever heard that I was like, Whoa, that's comedy too. Yeah. That was crazy. I remember when the first time I saw him, it was, it was a shock. It was like, wow, that's new. Yeah. That to changed the whole game. He changed comedy, man. He went hard on the religious stuff at a time when that was, and he got away with it too, because he was a former preacher that, yeah. The other way is like crazy. That was, he was, he was classic.

Speaker 11:         00:20:37       Does he have a dog? A daughter's right? Or does he have any

Speaker 2:          00:20:40       I, yeah. Well he has him with his friend's wife. Do you know that whole story? Yeah, I don't think so. You know, story. Um, he had a good fuck. I'm blanking on the dude's name now. The dude with a shaved head. Oh my goodness. Oh, shut up. No fuck. I can't believe I'm Carlo. Carlo was his buddy and his road partner. He opened for Kennison on the road and apparently Kinison was banging his wife and he didn't even know about it. And he had a kid with this chick and he thought it was his kid. It's kinnisons kid. So the whole time he's been raising this kid thinking it was his, it was his best friend. His best friend went up shithead. Wow. Banging his friend's wife. Wow. That'll end that without a condom. You fucking dirty bitch. He was crazy. You know, they said with Kennison it was a head injury that changed his whole life.

Speaker 2:          00:21:34       He was a kid. He got hit by a truck, said completely changed his personality by completely became a totally different person. We can reckless and crazy and loud wild for that. It was like a regular calm sort of a peaceful kid. Maybe he liked, didn't see another side and just realize, decided it was a, was he was going ham could be right. Yeah. He crossed over for a second or I think it's just head injuries in general are fucking really bad for you. You know, getting, getting your head fuck stops. Not good for some people it changes their personality. I've heard of dudes that, uh, became depressed. They, uh, they got just knocked out once and then they started getting like band depression like all the time. Like real had a really hard time being happy. Well just one concussion, you know, golf ball that ahead.

Speaker 2:          00:22:21       I know dude was fucked up by a golf ball that said for six months. He was just a mess. Six months, man. That's crazy man. Yeah. Yeah. And that's another thing that's going on with these soldiers. You know, the UFC has done, uh, a few of these, a fight for the troops for the head injury, traumatic brain injury. Yeah. I did like I'm one of those little essays for it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's a, that's some shit that's happening now. Like last, before it closed, I actually did a visit at Walter Reed where they have all the cats, you know, hit got hit with the IUD. Is that, that, that, that will change your perspective because there's dudes there with literally half a body. Yeah. And talking like I wish I could go back cause I got home, he's there and I need, you know, like they, it's crazy.

Speaker 2:          00:23:07       I'm kid got two artificial legs talking about he's getting ready to, you know, join the DEA. Wow. Like, you know, some crazy shit. Don't make your problems seem real, real small. You know? I think that sense of comradery that a lot of those guys have with each other too. It hits, it hits a crazy level, you know, it hits a level that other than the average person has civilian, it's probably never going to experience will the level of panic and fear and emotion in a moment of death is, you know, and then you're sharing it. So whatever secrets you got it, you know it's going to come to the service. Not necessarily like you're going to yell out your secrets, I'm saying, but if you're a guy who's gone cry while you're fighting or were they all that's

Speaker 8:          00:23:46       coming out and yeah, you know, is going, you're going to bond over that kind of shit. I would imagine that's why fight camps are always so close to, you know, like a, an MMA fight, camp shore martial arts schools. Oh that shit you, you experienced something really scary together. You know, it's not as scary as war, but any, anything. What's the old saying? There's no atheists in foxholes, man. Indeed. Indeed. So what else you got for us, man? Eight. Somebody put a request in that. I agree with 100% I love your fucking cover. A Fulsom prison brews. I'll get there, I'll kill you. It won't happen. It won't have the lead like dude dude, dude dude dude cause I only got one at a time so Brian can do it with his mouth.

That's the first time you've ever done in my life. Really? Yeah. Wow. That's awesome. I'm monitoring dude. That's bad ass. I love that song. Do you sometimes forget like, uh, did that lyrics are the thing and you have to kind of make shit up on the fly. Like, oh, like, oh, I just fucked up at Coursera. I would kind of bring it back like [inaudible] which, you know, I was still, I was taught by some cats that, that showed me along the way. If you mess up on the guitar, you know, do it again. Oh, just like go do it again. Okay. I look, make it look like you're meant to do it kind of thing. You know what I mean?

Speaker 3:          00:28:05       Or just own it. Own it and keep it moving. You know? I'll be honest, if I have a mess up terribly, I'll stop doing it. I was doing it shows the whole hold up man. Ah, this, yeah, that sucks right there. I just really chopped that to hell. So we're going to start over and what they get right. Is there a time limit? Like, yeah. If it's like 30 seconds left in this song, you're obviously, you're probably not going to do that. I mean, it would have to be something. It would have to be something that disturbed my groove enough. Right. Where I couldn't stop thinking about it, you know? Yeah. Which after 20 some odd years, it would take a pretty big bump in the road. You know, you've been on the road like crazy lately, right? You've been just doing? Yeah, I'm on a new new,

Um, sometimes I'll have another guitar guy sitting with me to cover like lead parts for the, you know, certain songs and little counter, you know, picking while I'm strumming kind of thing. Just to add to the song a little bit, I was just in Louisville when we were there. The University of, of Kentucky is playing the University of Louisville.

They couldn't have been nicer, friendlier, more fun. Louisville was the shit.

Speaker 1:          00:32:07       It's a fun place. That's the beautiful thing about clubs like the Improv, like look high end clubs is they develop like people that are like fans of comedy too. Like you know there's not a lot of places in the country where you can guarantee you're going to see like national level comedians but you know all the Improv's you're going to get like all big name comics going to come through. They couldn't have been any better man. That place was amazing. Louisville's a shit. Why I got to get to a show. I haven't been to one in a minute man. Next time you're in Monday I could have was about to, I'm about to

Speaker 2:          00:32:40       uh, lay down a uh, a video I say lay down. Cause I'm [inaudible] over their job is when I'm talking to musicians, man, I like to use their language. They don't have video laid down a video though, man. I'm saying that bitch down. You know some, some uh, comedy on that pitch. I'm going to put it on Vhs, Joe. Now Beta, bro. I'm sticking with Beta. So you wouldn't go there. I mean, are you already going the route? The same one as the, this the recently as Lucy can't guy just threw it out? No, his idea. I started totally stolen. I didn't have that idea first. Yeah, I was trying to gate and have it first. Either Radiohead today, music. It was kind of the same principle, I think. Yeah, he's the first guy to deal with comedy. Um, and now everybody's going to do it that way.

Speaker 2:          00:33:21       Comedy Central. Yeah, but your folks, man, I'm gonna tell you something about your folks, man. Hey, your folks love you. I love them too. I mean, these twice catch like it's, you know, it's, I don't want to say that's why I don't really know why. So I mean, that happens a lot of folks. That's going to be hollering at the website, man. Yeah. You know what, dude, I really firmly believe that when you put positive energy out there, you attract like minded people. You're going to get a few cots in the mix. It's inevitable, especially on the Internet. Especially like an in text form. Like when dudes get to tweet shitty things to be bullish on our message boards or something like that. Like yeah. My thing is like do you really think that stopped my day? Did he think that slowed me down in my ra?

Speaker 2:          00:34:04       Yeah. It's real simple man. Don't ever say anything to anybody that you wouldn't say to their face. Just don't do it. And if you do say it, say it as if you had say it to their face. Otherwise you're a cunt. It's that pretty much if I say something I'm going to say it to your face. Like I got a bunch of negative tweets here that night cause so some dude in front of the country music awards. Okay. Homeboy is standing there with fake rips in his jeans like you bought. Jeans are already pre ripped and he's standing in front of a jet and I dunno if the song was any good cause quite honestly I said the song was, I said, here's, I go, this is country I dudes wearing fake ripped jeans standing in front of a jet singing shitty song. And then the Hashtag was that ain't country. No, but it's silly jeans. You're a silly bitch. You're a silly bitch. If you weren't fucking fake ripped jeans period.

Speaker 11:         00:34:46       Thousand 12 ever had fake ripped jeans. Yeah, I might've. I might've. Yeah, I might have bought some. Yeah. Did you ever used to bleach your genes in the basement where report actual real bleach on your genes in the 80s no, I didn't

Speaker 2:          00:34:57       definitely have owned a pair of jeans with rips in them. They might've been like given to me from wardrobe on fear factor, but I had them in a warm, but it's, I'm, I'm old enough now to realize that's ridiculous. Kind of ridiculous. Very Nickelback by the way. Yeah.

Speaker 11:         00:35:10       But I bet you it's easy to buy him by mistake nowadays because now they have genes that just look like they're fucked up a little. But then you wash them once and they become ripped jeans, you know like where the, the the clothing is like very thin. Yeah. Like you can buy it by mistake going while those genes and the next thing you know you have some ripped jeans and you're at the rainbow room. Yeah. But this dude had brand new five o ones. If I were a junior, that's my new thing. Man. I just got them. I love all the way to do it. Crispy. I don't even wash them. These have not been washed like cardboard man. No, I'm serious.

Speaker 3:          00:35:38       This is how we're going. Then I throw them away. That's Bala. That's hilarious. That's it. A Charlie Murphy. I live, I live at the sergeant supply sergeant supply over there in Burbank, man. It really? Yeah. Was Five Oh ones all day long, man. Just get a new pair every week on the road. I throw up like 14 pairs of no in the last like three shows. Really? Yeah. You could probably sell those sits up so much on the bus and stuff. I wear gym shorts and just kind of lounge around, so, but do you actually throw them out and you give them to like goodwill or something nice. Kind of usually leave him in a hotel. You should. I really want it. Usually on solar I sweat so much, like in those things, man, every, it'd be like, you know, I don't have time to wash them and I'm not trying to give him the goodwill, like just loaded with my, you're loaded with my DNA, you know what I mean?

Speaker 3:          00:36:25       I bet there's some people out there that would buy it big, big. I'll just start tweeting hotel rooms across. Yeah. I'm leaving some jeans here. Ate Taco bell earlier. Might smell great. Yeah. Yeah. You should just, yeah. This is going to be dudes who it'd be jerking off sniffing. It's a doozy. I got really real up. I'll never throw another way of five oh one four the stinky in my pinky. Okay. What? I think you need to play a song, just a curious of what he does. Right. By the way, that surplus store is really awesome and I go there to buy like fucking gas masks and crazy shit all the time. But then I feel like people actually wore these and died in Nepal where like military pants and jeans is what I wear. So yeah, that's my wardrobe man. Those are the best. Like cargo pants fit so much. Shit. I don't need to carry around my fanny pack. I've got a fanny pack. People think I'm bullshitting. Catch me at the airport. Ready to sweat my fanny pack. Yeah. Oh yeah. Here we go.

I remember when I wrote it, man, it was real hard back in the day and another 59, man, I'm so stoned with watching this. [inaudible] it's almost too much. Really? Yeah. It's just, uh, it's, it's like freaks me out a little, being able to just see this so close to me. I don't know. It's weird. This would be the dopest intimate concert of all time. Yeah. My dog's named Johnny Cash. Is that right? Who did Johnny Cash Fan? I had a rottweiler named Elvis. Uh, I had a pit bull named Frank Sinatra. That's awesome. But that was before I really got to know Frank Sinatra. Personality still is frank. Oh Man. But better off having a pit bull named frank. I'll raise you with Tony. Tony Bennett. I had a cat named skittles. Skittles. Yeah. I had a uh, in Florida shoot him

Speaker 8:          00:41:34       cat named Jack Dempsey. I should a ride. I just got to say, and I don't care. I don't care what the kid did. You can see they're saying, oh, I'm going there. Was that all right? Okay, good. Can I go there on this Trayvon Martin thing? My, my take on it? Yeah. Yeah, please. No matter what the kid did. There's two kinds of 17. There's Lebron James 17. It looks like a 36 year old man. Right, right, right. And then there's child 17, and I haven't seen one picture of this kid that isn't a child. 17. And this dude, ways of outweighed him by a hundred pounds. 100 million. Yeah. Italy. Oh, it's, you seen the size of the dude and I pictures from what I'm seeing, I'm guessing on that one. On the wait. Okay. Outweighed him significantly. Regardless of that. Most he's in danger of his blood or broken jaw.

Speaker 8:          00:42:19       Maybe a black guy. His story and I don't know what happened. I'm just saying grown man against a kid. I'm talking about me against a 17 year old kid. I need to, there's no kid on earth that, that looks like that in the eyes. Like a baby, like a child. Not like a grown man, like dude who's been like through the, you know, the client is going to put me on my back and kill me. Yeah, but that's you. This guy might've been kind of a bitch, you know. I mean this guy, I'm just saying murder's murder. He tried to be a cop and as far as I'm concerned, the one that stood his ground at night is the one that's dead baby. But maybe not. You know his stories that the kid came back and attacked him and he actually has supposedly ABC news was reporting Destinee.

Speaker 8:          00:43:03       They've enhanced the video and they found cuts in the back of his head. Which Shannon on the back of your head. I just don't see it as worth killing somebody. I agree with you. But I mean his story is the kid was trying to get his gun. His story is told you not to follow. Dude, police told you stay out of it. [inaudible] this is a man who thought he was an authority figure and was itching to use his gun. That's the bottom line. And I'll leave her to town. But he did apparently according to the nine one one call, they told him to turn around and he did turn around and his story is, that's when the kid jumped up. I don't know what the fuck is true. I don't know what he could have said to the kid to piss them off like that if he did.

Speaker 8:          00:43:40       You know, I, I definitely agree that dude was into being, uh, itching uses gun man. But it also could have been that, you know, they were in a life and death struggle. I wasn't mad, man. I agree that the only reason it was us, we, if it was a life and death struggle though, you'll get grant Munis. And the only reason it was because one of them brought a gun and it wasn't the kid. That's true. Yeah. And he, he thought he now had there not been a gun there. The worst that could have probably happened in the situation was one of the others got their ass kicked. Right. Right. If there hadn't been against, there was no gun at the scene. But his deal is that he's trying to be like neighborhood patrol man with a gun. Well it would would be wants to somebody, actually you have a gun, you want to shoot somebody need when there's bad people out there.

Speaker 8:          00:44:26       That kid was not what he was looking for obviously. But I'm saying, but hold on a second. You know that in that neighborhood, a man is in critical condition right now of 50 year old guy who got beaten almost to death with hammers and two to 18 year old kids were arrested. They robbed him and they beat the fuck out of this guy with hammers. So it's not like there's not bad people in the world that you could use a gun. There was no, I agree. Are there wouldn't be a dead person. That is true, but that is this scenario. There could have been an easily a scenario. This is a very bad area with these people who live in and there's a lot of break and entries as a lot of robbery. A lot of us. You're right. Which is why in the correct manner, I'm just saying studio, they are.

Speaker 8:          00:45:03       When I look at decade, well I do as well, but he's just that kid. That's a terrible situation. Real mother fucker could sense evil. You know what I mean? Like the kind of evil that would beat up man to death with hammers. That you could sense that Joe, you can feel that in the air. I agree. I agree. But again, if that was his story, I don't know what the fuck happened Bro. But his story is that the kid jumped him. That's his story. If that's his story yet. Yeah. Well it's been, it's been out there. It's been, I ain't heard him tell his with his words. Yeah, I ain't heard him tell his story. You know, I haven't heard anybody else if be sat here in front of me and told his story and I looked in his eyes and I believed him. That's a different, but do you understand that?

Speaker 8:          00:45:44       I don't want no one's talked. No one's talked. We're getting all Nancy Grayson saying, I see a little baby. I'm saying I'm not even talking about race a race. Nothing else aside. I'm saying had a man that was itching, itching to be a bad ass with a gun, not brought a gun to a situation that didn't need it anyways. True. There wouldn't be a dead person. If a guy that's wrongful death, that's murder man. You had some big John McCarthy type cop out there. Nothing would ever happened. He would've said the kid, how are you doing tonight? And the kid who said, I'm all good, and they would have said, have a good night. Be careful in. That would've been the end of it. It's a lot of it is people that are looking for trouble and a lot of the reason why they're looking for troubles that cause they're insecure and this easily could have been with this guy was deal is, I don't know the dude.

Speaker 8:          00:46:26       I'm just saying, I see your baby days. That bothers me. That is the Bob is a fuck out of me. I'll be honest, if those pictures had looked like he was a hood, I would probably feel a lot different. I'd probably be like, Oh man, looks like he's kind of a hood, but I don't. It's just looks like a kind of kid to me. It's true. It is true. But you know, I don't bring a gun against a kid man. I'm just saying, I thought he was going to run into kids though. You know, he's patrolling to run into a situation where he could pull out his gun. Maybe you might be right or why else would you carry it if you're not your average police officer? I bet you your average real like normal personality of a human being, police officer, Pri does not like the fact that all that they have a gun all the time. I would disagree with that heavily. I have a lot of friends that use of it would be not a lot of friends that are cops. They don't want to pull that gun out. That's for God. Damn. That's what I mean. I mean in a sense that the, you know, the thought of using it is actually very foreboding and not something interesting at all. I have friends that have shot people before and you talked to them about and then it's not a pleasant memory. It's not a good thing, you know? Uh, I've,

Speaker 2:          00:47:30       I've, I've had, that's the thing on your belt, the last thing you ever really want to have to reach for. I had a conversation with the dude just a couple of weeks after you had a shoot dude. And he was, you know, just start starting to get back into the swing of things in his head. You know, just dealing with the fact, he's like, I'm happy I did it. He goes like, I was a piece of shit. But let me tell you, it's to fucking tricky thing taking a man's life. Yeah, it's crazy. I would like to hear the dude tell the story. Yeah. I would tell me I wish I hadn't is doing more harm than good while his [inaudible] you know the real issue though is there's the legal issue. I mean this guy, if he is innocent, if you are innocent, you really should shut the fuck up until your lawyers get your, you know, get everything in the proper order.

Speaker 2:          00:48:10       And this too many channels right now for prosecutors to go after, people that aren't necessarily guilty. And there's a lot of people behind bars right now that if they had better representation, if they didn't open the fucking mouth. I'm not saying in this guy's case, but if the guy is innocent, he really probably should shut the fuck up until he actually goes to trial or talks to the prom. But him going on, Larry King, sorry. Can't do anything anymore. No, him going on Pierce Morgan, here's, you know that ain't got his brother was on piers Morgan though. Yeah, I didn't. I missed that. Yeah, his brother was on. I didn't mean to go there, but I just know let's man, you went there because it's a part of my culture kind of bugs me. You know what I mean? It's like God needed to, you know? I just feel like I said, there's, there's two different 17 year olds and you know, I don't know if you want, if you, if you miss doing neighborhood watch, you, you're supposed to be looking out for your community.

Speaker 2:          00:48:58       How do you know that wasn't a person from your community? You must not approach them in a manner that was like, excuse me sir, or excuse me, what's going on? You know what I mean? There must've been some real rude shit and if you didn't bring a gun, nobody would be dead. That is true, but that's my biggest point is that if the dude that wasn't itching to use his weapon didn't bring a weapon, there probably wouldn't be even anything except a kid. And you know that got scraped up in a scuffle or a man that got scraped up in a scat. That is true in this situation, you know? But against this guy I'm talking about, that's not necessarily what this guy was looking for when he's armed doing is neighborhood watch. He's looking for people like these two kids. One of them's 18 five foot eight and he was wearing a blue denim shirt and he beat a fucking 50 year old man with a hammer.

Speaker 2:          00:49:40       You know, that guy's fucked up. That guy is severely fucked up and we'll probably never be the same human being again. He might die. I wonder if he dies. They'll pay as much attention as this kid that got shot. Cause it's Kinda fascinating man. You know, there's a lot of people that are real squeamish about talking about black kids doing something violent to wipe you out. I ain't got no problem. We were, you raised him. I know. You know what I mean? I don't need to, I gotta say I admit it openly. Like if it looked a lot more hood, I'd probably would mentally feel different about it. That's just natural. What your mind works. I'm talking about our culture. I'm not necessarily talking about you. I think on our culture it's a, it's interesting. We all have a little bit of that regardless of all of us on it. We're also looking to catch people in a Gotcha moment of racism. We love that. We would love to find someone who especially saw a safe situation like that. And to

Speaker 3:          00:50:28       be honest, the real problem isn't even Ms. Dot. Zimmerman. The real problem is this law called the stand your ground law that says, if me and you are in a place basically and nobody else is around, and I say you attack me and make it look that way, you can shoot, I can easily kill you and get away with it.

Speaker 2:          00:50:44       Cool. And it's just two people, man. It's fucking hard to figure out what the hell happened. Exactly. I know there's a lot of crazy fuckers out there that can just tell lies, man. You know there's a, there's a lot of people out there that are completely socio.

Speaker 3:          00:50:56       Exactly. So if you give them opportunity to use their gun in a situation, it's like a lot of people could start disappearing or falling victim to a, you know, a self defense.

Speaker 2:          00:51:07       Who would you like actually moved to Florida just so they could shoot people easier. You know, just start some arguments. I went down here, man. I went down in Florida is one of the weirdest fucking places in the country. It really does feel like you're in another place. I'm there in two weeks. I'm doing not a Improv in Fort Lauderdale. I like going down there. They know how to party. There are a lot of fun people, but it really feels like you're on an island somewhere and you know, in another country that it's like subject to us rules. But no one's really watching. Let's kind of like to wow. You know, still the 80s down there in a weird way. Yeah. In a lot of ways. Yeah. It's Florida strange kind of where the whole place is built on

Speaker 3:          00:51:44       cocaine money, man. Literally like literally there's that whole like you've seen the cocaine cowboys like, right? Yeah. Like my f downtown. Miami's like literally built with kilos of cocaine. They just poured it into the cement.

Speaker 2:          00:51:57       Yeah. It's amazing. It's so ridiculous. What I, there's more banks per capita apparently in Miami than anywhere. It's all just money laundering going down left and right. If you haven't seen cocaine cowboys folks, we've talked about it before, you must, you must,

Speaker 3:          00:52:13       can, you must see it. See? Yes, yes, yes. To that was to the US and then with the grant. The godmother. Yeah, the Godmother who's alive. This bitch is killed. Who knows how many fucking, and she's just chilling. So she made like 500 mil a year in jail and she was such a bad ass bitch that ain't even tried to kill her

Speaker 2:          00:52:35       a woman and they just let her run shit. Oh my God. That's a crazy documentary. Yeah. I think Miami's the closest to a foreign country we have in America outside of Puerto Rico, which is technically sort of America, right?

Speaker 3:          00:52:48       Isn't cause I still don't think debating that recently. Like whether they want to become a state finally come on, just be a state. What do you give a fuck? But it's cool to fucks up all the flags though, man. We got everybody's got to get a new flag. Yeah, right on my harbor. Some resentment. Where would we put that extra

Speaker 2:          00:53:05       star? Where the fuck is that going to go? I don't know. Spit, you know that's going to take like a some sort of mathematical seamstress type to figure out weird shit like Hawaii. Five hours in a fucking room

Speaker 3:          00:53:17       lane over the ocean and yet it's still America, Alaska. I had some Alaskans come to the last show and they were telling me like, who

Speaker 11:         00:53:26       do, how do I tip you? Uh, after I got off stage and I'm like, what are you talking about? Goes, I'm well, I want to tip you. And I'm like, no, you don't take, he's like, oh, this is my first comedy show and it's the most insane thing I've ever seen in my life and it's, I want to tip you. I'm like, no, don't tip me what the fuck you're talking about. But it was so weird talking that he seemed like he was from a different country. Like he, he, he was talking all this other things like that.

Speaker 2:          00:53:47       Well, essentially they are. Yeah. I mean it really is. It's not attached. Right. I mean, my joke, if it's not attached, it's just some shit we stole. Right. That is what it is. Or Barn. Yeah. Would you ever go to the Indian bought from somebody who stole it fucking whiskey and they took Manhattan for like seven bucks. Would you ever go to Alaska to do comedy or do you think is like now you people there for that? Yeah, it was pretty Douglas. Stan hope used to go there all the time, but they just got to be too stupid for him. He bailed after awhile. He couldn't take it anymore. Did get pretty nutty up there. From what I hear, man. Hell yeah. They do six months a day live six months and night. Yeah. And there's bears everywhere and you know, it's fucking crazy. You live in nutty place. It's ridiculous. He live in a place where humans, humans aren't necessarily supposed to be. It's for fucking for reason. For a good chunk of the year. Like death freezing, like Antarctic style freezing this, this, I couldn't do it. Yeah, that's, that's hard. Do you ever see that movie 30 days of night?

Speaker 2:          00:54:44       Is it a vampire movie? Yeah, pretty good vampire movie man. And they, uh, the, the vampires go to Alaska because they could just fuck people up for a whole month. It doesn't get light out for a month. That's gotta be depressing a shit, you know? I mean you think say adol is depressing Seattle.

Speaker 9:          00:55:04       How am I went to Copenhagen and uh, we land in and we went to this place, we had heard of this legendary place called Christianity. I don't know if you're familiar. It's like a place that squatters took over apparently in, and they were legally, they, it's basically a little section in the middle of the city where they, they can slang hash and weed and they just, government kind of looks the other way. They're squatters. But every once in a while the government goes in there and like tries to rate it and they fight him off. It's crazy. This little section is called Christiania. How big is it? It's tiny. The Cup. It's like maybe six blocks of land. So it was just within like a gate and it's like, it looks like a hippie community. Like looks like little little gardens in this nap. And then you walk down this road and they got all these sheds set up and their slang in weed there.

Speaker 9:          00:55:46       Wow. Good weed. Yeah. So like I remember we got some real good way. Went back to the hotel and smoked up and it was about seven in the evening and the sun was still out. So Bang, let me smoke weed. This weed knocked me out. I fell out. I wake up, I look at my watch and says, three, I look outside, it's light. It's, I was like, man, that shit knock me out from seven last night, two to three the next afternoon, Jesus Christ. So I go downstairs and I'm talking to the lady, something about something at the desk and I'm like, yeah, I was there. Where's, where's a good place to eat? She's like, sir, it's three in the morning. She's like, it's not three in the,

Speaker 8:          00:56:24       that blew my mind. It's short circuited me. That was one day, right? Like it, it screwed me on where I went up to the room and like my brain was having a hard time processing the thought of the sun being out bright as hell at three in the morning. How long is it bright for? If he goes down apparently for like an hour, like between 12 and one every night it kind of goes down and it doesn't ever go all the way down. It's kind of dusk and then it comes back up. It's must be so happy that certain times of the year, this is like summertime and um, I bet the winters, I don't know if it's different, I don't know if they suffered the opposite, but it was like, it's short circuiting me. So what my point is is like six months of something like that.

Speaker 8:          00:56:57       Yeah. Would, would pry fry your board man, I'm pretty sure they do in Alaska. I'm pretty sure in Alaska there's moments where they have like almost perpetual sunlight. I think they just have like an hour where it goes down for a little bit and comes back up. I think that's the case up there too. His Copenhagen's pretty far up there, man. It's weird that they would just decide to like not have things open at three in the morning when it's bright out. Just stay the dead. Come on. It's like, why are you doing hire somebody or if you had a data business, do you know that could be your option to do? Yeah. The reason why shit is closed is because he can't see outside without lights on. That's why shit's closed. Okay. Now that he could see how the side with lights on keep shit open.

Speaker 8:          00:57:32       Yeah. Why fuck you doing man? What do you need to sleep or something? What do you hate? Money. I hate money and he'd asleep. What is your favorite place to tour? Do you have a favorite country to go to? Um, I'm really a big vantage of pan just because it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's the place where I feel the most foreign. You know what I mean? It's like, I honestly feel like a foreigner and I enjoy that feeling like of being the different one. Kind of. Yeah. You know, even though it's got your two guys in, you know more than I, but I've never run into anything. Well there's, there's one Sushi bar they wouldn't serve me because I was guiding the, yeah. Then I went to this bar and then died. Apparently the dude just wasn't that did on serve guys. Gene at this bar.

Speaker 8:          00:58:10       Wow. Forget the name of it. But how long ago was this? This recent? No, no, within a decade, but like eight, nine years ago and probably Brian and I just want a couple of weeks ago. First Time you actually longer, maybe like 15 years ago. Damn. Yeah. I wonder if it's changed now. Maybe we haven't heard that associated with old cats that are just like, I'm not giving you my fish. Yeah. I re I remembered 60 years ago and you can't have my fish. Yeah. How old was it, dude? Do you think he was alive back then? I don't know. But you know old the old enough. Yeah. Yeah, but don't fucking crazy thing for a country to go through. Could you imagine if we found out like Chicago disappeared in the middle of the night, you know, Chicago and Phoenix disappeared. Boom. In like in a second gone. How would we react to some country that just took Chicago and Phoenix just vaporized? It just vaporized 500,000 people, whatever. Fuck it was. We're the only ones I've ever did it. Woo. That's dark. It's crazy. It's dark. It's really crazy. If you ever look at all the different weapons that are wive like that, the United States has all the different nuclear warheads you seen like a map of like Russia's nuclear warheads, United States

Speaker 2:          00:59:22       doing car warheads. I ran, supposedly is working on some shit, but Israel's got a ton of shit. Pakistan has nuclear weapons and nuclear weapons, you know, they're like, hey, I ran, can't have them. But everybody's got 'em, you know? Yeah. They shouldn't have them, but nobody should have, um, North Korea's gone. Um, it's really amazing when you look at how many of them there are. Like if you look at a map of the United or the, the entire world rather than all the, the nuclear arsenal, we could wipe out the whole planet completely. Oh, many, many times over. That's insane. And I don't know how they're ever going to fix that. How are they going to stop those things, you know, from being active.

Speaker 9:          00:59:57       Gotcha. Do trigger that. The law of averages says sometime whether it's now or a thousand years from now, some of that Shit's gonna

Speaker 2:          01:00:04       pop off. Yeah. People believe that that happened in the past. There's a lot of people that believed that there was, at one point in time, people had figured out a nuclear power and we had a, there's, there's like evidence of giant, massive explosions and parts of like, uh, the Middle East and stuff like that. I, it'd be able to believe it was Lebanon or something like that where people believe this. It's one of those old ancient civilization Atlantis ideas. Yeah. We'll bring some along those lines. You know, that they think that at one point in time we had figured out nuclear power. They know, he figured out batteries. They had batteries. They found in like the pyramids and Shit, which is pretty fascinating. You know, they figured out some shit, but I doubt they ever had nuclear power. That's pretty preposterous. The aliens, man, d aliens do. Aliens did it too. If the aliens come, was that a good thing or bad thing? The aliens aren't already here. Then we, then we talk about my alien technology or any your alien, alien technology, you know your heart. Yeah. It's titanium valve. I firmly believe there's Dalian technology here, dog be, it's absolutely married. How do you think that works? They just give us a little stuff and tell us to evolve,

Speaker 9:          01:01:08       you know, or you know, if you know, okay. Let you know or similar to something of, you know, some things that got left behind and just got studied in front, properly looked at. You know what I mean? Like some terminator where they got the little chip and they're like backwards engineering every Jane, you know what I mean? You know? Or it's something that we already have that we just take for granted. Like birds or something. Like birds are the aliens the whole time. Why did the array of conversation, I forgot how wide the span of topics get on it. Yeah. Well I think

Speaker 2:          01:01:35       that's, it's just like having a real conversation, right? Oh yeah. You know, amongst owners. Yeah. Fuck yeah. I think, um, if, uh, if aliens are here and I don't think they're giving us anything, I don't believe that I did. I don't know if we've ever captured any alien craft and back engineered it. It sounds sexy, but it also sounds like a crock of shit. I know. I don't buy it. There's not a big enough leap. You know, there's some leaps, you know, like the transistor, there's a few things in the fuel look back at like, but it's all pretty much documented how everybody figured out everything and every step along the way. I used to think before I looked into it that maybe there was some shit that the, the army learn from Roswell and you know, that may be the, they'd figured, Eh, now I don't think so.

Speaker 2:          01:02:17       He just shit on our cars. Yeah. Well, you know what? I think, man, I think, uh, if we have had some contact with an alien life form, I think there's so fucking far past us that they can pause the earth and sweep up and then disappear again. I mean, I think we're dealing with some mother fuckers food. Yeah. Or, yeah, we could be that. Well, I wish they would eat some more of us. There's too many of us, you know, too many shitheads. There should be a test and if you know, if you don't pass the test, you get fucking turned into barbecue. Like, like Logan's runners. Yeah. But then you don't want people to miss their family and their loved ones. I don't want you to lose your, your family cause you're a dumb ass and the alien came and eight you, I would have to be fighting with you against the aliens was that would probably turn most douche bags into, you know, probably more respectable people anyway.

Speaker 2:          01:03:02       That's true. Right? Yeah. If we knew that there was a alien that was watching there was going to eat you if you were a client. Yeah. That would be good incentive to not be a continent. But then it'd be suicide by alien. People just caught off. Just fucking run around breaking windows, lose it for a day. Suicide by alien man. Girl breaks up you I'm going fucking to by alien and people see him running down the street. Fuck you. Fuck you throwing rocks and shit and everybody watches because they know what's going to happen. Aliens show up, eat them. Hey could happen. What was it? What was the song will make great pets. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, we will. Well, you know, if you look at how we treat everything that's intelligent, that we don't understand, like dolphins and orchestras and, and even primates like chimpanzee would treat them like shit.

Speaker 2:          01:03:51       It put them in cages and shit. You know, we, we don't know. We don't necessarily enhanced her life. Went out there given chimpanzees laptops and showing him how to spell in a, we teach them a few things to get do tricks for candy so we could figure out how smart they are. But that's no different than studying prisoners. You know, that's like psychological tests on prisoners. That's all that shit is. It's really funny that we would think that aliens would be any different than us. If you look at every single intelligent species on this planet, you know, even semi-intelligent, they all take advantage of those underneath them. Killer whales eat dolphins, dolphins eat their babies. Chimps eat monkeys. We were cunts, all lifeforms on this planet. It seems like her cunt. So we're, we're, we're hoping that if there are, and you know, it is not an alien life form that's super intelligent.

Speaker 2:          01:04:41       We're hoping they're not, they're better than us. They're way better than us. We're, we're trusting that they've got their shit together. Oh, I'm not trusting anything. I'm just saying that we might have learned a few things in the last few years off or some shit. Yeah. I wouldn't trust the alien far as I could throw him. But you really think we've learned things from a back engineered alien technology. I like to believe it. I believe it to believe it. I can't prove it. I love to believe can prove it. I wouldn't swear to it. If you told me like my life depended on it, would you swear to it? I'd say, Oh fuck. Now it probably is bullshit. I have on my wall. I have a framed the daily Roswell daily record or whatever the fuck the newspaper is that the very newspaper where they reported that they had a crashed Ufo, that they've recovered it, that they've sent the parts of it to Wright Patterson Air Force Base. They thought they had something man. I mean they put the shit in the paper that it was a crashed UFO. Wonder what it was. You know, I really wish I had,

Speaker 8:          01:05:37       I talked to g Gordon Liddy about this shit. I had g Gordon Liddy. I mean there is an area 51 out there. You go knowing that Neil come and kill you, they'll kill you. Yeah. They shoot on sight when I am, I ain't romanticizing them and I just, I just know, look at stars, there's a billion of them to think during some other life forms out there is just, you know, a little bit arrogant. Yeah, for sure. I just don't know if they come here, maybe not. Might be really hard to do. It might be too hard even for like if you want to get real stoner and you know, we can be like, well, maybe if they were that advanced they wouldn't even need these ships and all this crap. They'd traveled in interdimensionally. Well, you know, the real theory that

Speaker 2:          01:06:16       that trips me out, man, is that we came from Mars. The real theory is that the reason why human life is different from all the other primate life on this planet is that what had happened was there had been the development of lower hominids on this, on this planet that were like reaching close towards being like a human being, but hadn't quite gotten there. Right. But we were existing on a completely different planet. Mars and Mars used to have water. Mars used to have an atmosphere of faces. I don't believe in all that. I think that most of it looks like bullshit. Yeah. Most of it looks like tricks and shadows. If you really pay attention to the high resolution photos and the experts that have and that people want to see some shit, but most likely it's just tricks and shadows. There's a few objects up there like the pyramid looking things that make you go, Huh, but there's some natural things that look like this. Things called the yardangs, you know, that look like they're, they're like a look like a face carved on a rock. But it really is just the natural stone structure.

Speaker 8:          01:07:10       Did you read the book about all that? Yeah. Graham Hancock's book or read his book about it, right. Cause against women are from Venus, men are from Mars or whatever.

Speaker 2:          01:07:18       Not that book is, um, it's uh, there's a lot of dudes who believed that there was at one point in time a civilization on Mars that made its way to earth many, many, many, many thousands of years ago. And it was like started humping the finer lake. Primate chicks think we're them. I think the idea is that we're them. You know, the, the, I think the doe guns in, uh, Africa, a whole tribe and that's their, their entire mythology there at Tyler entire mythology is based on the fact that we are a tribe from Mars and that we came here

Speaker 8:          01:07:47       fucking fascinating show. Have to Google that one. I'm going to have to Google. That one is fascinating shit, man.

Speaker 2:          01:07:53       I don't think it's possible, but yet look bad. We put a fucking rover on Mars, man. We flew a fuck on rover and we're taking pictures from Mars all day. Yeah, I mean they have all kinds of cool shit going on. High resolution closeup photos and we know that we can put a man in space and we know we can fucking send an object to, to Mars and if we can get someone in space to stay alive and you know, not the cook them with gamma ray bursts from giant Starks exploding out there in the galaxy, which is very possible, you know? But if, if we can get them all the way to Mars, like six months and they stay alive, they've got enough food, dude, they can do what's called terraforming, where they can build machines that are big enough to actually create an artificial atmosphere on Mars.

Speaker 2:          01:08:34       That's like, that's possible. Even within our lifetime, if they really started dedicating themselves towards it. That's some crazy shit, man. Maybe spending some of these billions there. Yeah. Fuck all this watershed. Could you imagine if they really did establish a base on the moon and a base on Mars? Could you fucking imagine how crazy that would feel? Just to know as we are now, that would have happened. Like as kids, we were told 2012 oh my God, it's going to be Jetsons land out there. Well, that's the big argument against the moon landing. You know, there's, there's not a whole lot of arguments against the moon landing. That makes sense. And this is coming from someone as argued it, I've said to people, I don't believe we landed on the moon. That's ridiculous. I, what the fuck do I know? I have no idea. It's preposterous. But I do know that there hasn't been anything from 1969 cheaper, easier a fastener behind you on that.

Speaker 2:          01:09:24       But, but the moon landings, it's a fascinating subject. You know, I, I think most likely what happened is they did put people on the moon, but they faked a lot of the footage. There's some of that footage, some photographs that look fake as fuck. There's even a guy named Jay Wiener who made a documentary about it. There's something called a, a front screen projection method of filming things before they had a green screen and I'm co Kubrick used it in 2001 and his idea is that that's the same techniques they use to fake some of these uh, videos. And he doesn't believe that that the moon landing was a hoax. But what he believes is that some of the video is, it's actually faked. Yeah. Preposterous. Yes. And uh, it's really, uh, it's a, it's a fascinating subject, especially when you consider the fact that we know that they definitely fake some propaganda photos from earlier.

Speaker 2:          01:10:17       NASA had these pictures of Michael Collins and he was a attached like by wire says thing like doing training exercises. And all they did was take that and they cropped him and put it in the like a black background and they said he was on a moonwalk. It's the exact photo. So we know that that was a standard practice. We know that there was at least some shenanigans going on for sure. Or someone decided to take a photo and black it out. So his idea was that it's much more likely that they went. But you know, first of all, your fucking, if they did go, there's a lot of radiation and shit. You're dealing with you. You're telling me your, your film's going to be Hunky dory out there at 250 degrees on the moon with all the fucking radiation. You can't even put your, your film through the, the airport metal detector.

Speaker 2:          01:11:03       It gets fucked up, especially back in 1969 and these were like regular special Hasselblad cameras that were designed for the moon landing, but there were no different than the camera's on earth. They weren't like super insulated or something like that. The whole thing is fascinating to me, man. I could, I could trip on it for hours. I wish I knew a dude who is really, really smart who didn't believe it, you know? But I don't everybody that I know that doesn't believe it is only marginally smart and they're really smart dudes that I know believe we went to the moon. So it's a fucking, it's a real tough argument, right? You know everything you think we went or no, I don't know. See this one of them things. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:11:42       I was convinced days. There's days when I'm like, my biggest thing is like you, it's like, why haven't we been back? Why haven't you been back

Speaker 2:          01:11:49       once in 60? [inaudible] 70 [inaudible] almost 50 years. Yeah. Apparently there's, they were making fun of me about this on some podcast called the skeptic's guide to the universe. I, I haven't heard it. I heard it's funny though, and I would make fun of me too, especially if I was a scientist and I actually knew things, you know? But there's, there's certain things that I find absolutely fascinating about conspiracy theory and the moon landing is my favorite one. That's my number one one. Yes. That's a good one too. That's a good one. And AIDS is not real. That's my other one.

Speaker 3:          01:12:23       That's a good one too. I never heard that. Oh, that's a fascinating one. That's, uh, that's one. Um,

Speaker 2:          01:12:30       bye. [inaudible]. This is a guy named Peter Duesberg, who's a biologist to do to prove yourself, like supposedly pricked himself with the, with who? I don't know about that. I remember it. I thought, I remember back in the day like some doctor, actually I'd say you had something that was supposedly aids virus and freaked himself with it. Yeah, no, I don't know if that's the same guy. This was a while back though. I'm going to read you a quote from Bill Clinton and we can get off the spoon thing, and this is one of my favorite all time quotes at anybody's ever said in regards to a conspiracy theory is, is uh, Bill Clinton. Uh, in his book he wrote just a month before Apollo 11 astronauts buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong had left their colleague Michael Collins aboard spaceship Columbia and had walked on the moon beating by five months. President Kennedy's goal of putting a man on the moon before the decade was out. The old carpenter asked me if I believed it happened. I said, sure. I saw it on television and he disagreed. He said that he didn't believe it. For a minute and that them television fellers could make things look real weird, real, that weren't, he goes back then, I thought the guy was a crank during my eight years in Washington. I saw some things on TV that made me wonder if he wasn't ahead of his time.

Speaker 3:          01:13:43       The fucking president said that, don't fucking president said that. And all they did was leave a real vague open. Yeah. Being there. You shouldn't say that Mr. Clinton. That is not fair at him. He's having a laugh about that right there. Sick in the pits on everybody, man. He's a troll. Maybe he did that shit.

Speaker 2:          01:14:04       Sell records or to sell books. You know. Could you hear about that dude that said that a Jimi Hendrix manager killed him? Have you heard about that? Yeah, that storm. I think that's also another buy my book. You think so? I thought so too, until I looked into it and uh, the way he died, he drownded wine, they said he had nine sleeping pills in his, in his mouth and uh, you know, he had swallowed them. And you know, when he coughed up a lot of it, nine sleeping pills and literally drowned in wine, like that's what killed them. Like it's almost like he was taking in wine while he was unconscious. It's really kind of fucked up if the manager really did kill the guy. It's absolutely fascinating. What do, what does that video of Bill Clinton dancing? Oh No, it's not. Is it really? How dare you? Um, this, um, but this guy who was the singer from the animals not to do Eric burden. Now is that as Eric Burdon the guy who wrote that? Um, it's Eric Burdon in the animals. The original animals is always the same guy. Pretty sure that's not the guy's name. Maybe it is something [inaudible] hold on. Uh, no tour manager. That's what you're going go roadie. No Rogan and Google me.

Speaker 2:          01:15:15       You're talking about Kendrick smart. Oh, there you go. That's right. How in new woo, what do they come? Oh No, no. That's all. I just know that Bart James, right? That's the dude's name. Really. James Tapi. Right. Maybe he wasn't the singer. Maybe he was one of the dudes in the band. Okay, I might be wrong, but the video they showed of him, it looked like he was the singer. Um, it's pretty fucking fascinating shit man. But a lot of people who are calling bullshit, a lot of people calling bullshit. But then other people believe that it happened. And one of the reasons they also believe that happened as because his manager was a notorious criminal. Um, apparently Hendrix had a really scary manager. This dude named Michael Jeffrey and he even had Hendricks kidnap once to show Hendricks how much power he had. He had these last kidnap him and hold him for three days.

Speaker 2:          01:16:30       I wasn't familiar with all this. He saved Hendricks. He came in and saved them and they said like, see, you know, without me, you're fucked. And Hendrick's girlfriend apparently hated him. Well, Hendricks girlfriend was thrown off the roof of the Chelsea hotel. She died and Hendrix died this way. They're both dead. And there was a big life insurance policy apparently on Hendrix. And that's the, the knock that this guy saying, he says, and this Guy James Wright wrote a book about it. Yeah. It could be just trying to sell some books. Could be, but who the fuck knows who the manager, Dude's still around. No. Died in a plane crash, died in a plane crash on a couple of years. It makes you wonder though, if it would've came out of Vinci, like he might've stuff told somebody

Speaker 11:         01:17:10       or wrote it down and as [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          01:17:12       well journal book, apparently the manager was a scumbag and was always broken, always owed money and was borrowing money from the mob. And uh, that was uh, part of the problem was that the mob was involved in all this and he was scared to come out and talk about it. Who the fuck knows if it's not true, fuck you in your ass with a broken bottle. You piece of shit. If you made that up, you fuck hat of. That's true. But you know, you'd have to, you'd have to be a really fucked up dude to make up a story like that. Or You could be in a bad situation. Just needs some cash. That's the best way to sell a book or really had a dislike for the person you're telling the story around, even though it's dead. He's been dead since like 1970 something. I think, man, I don't know. Wish I knew and wishes

Speaker 9:          01:17:56       nearly. Dude, I fancy myself a pretty big Jimi Hendrix fan and I'm totally unfamiliar with any of this stuff. Be to girlfriend getting killed and him die. You know what I mean? I was, you know, we heard the legend of him dying on his own, choking on his own vomit and

Speaker 1:          01:18:10       yeah, yeah, yeah. I, uh, it, this all started because a, I have a thread on my message board where, um, it's called the things they got wrong on the podcast because, you know, we're always high talking shit. We're, we're often incorrect, you know, so I like to look at it every now and then, you know, to find maybe some shit I didn't know. But sometimes people write things and they don't even bother Google on. They just say, you're wrong about this. And like, dude, even research it at all. Like he said, we were talking about Hendricks and I'm a huge Hendrix fan and, uh, we were talking about heroin once on the show. And why is it so many great musicians love heroin and all these people like Hendricks. Do you do here? When he was arrested for heroin, it was arrested for heroin. He wasn't a junkie would start it.

Speaker 1:          01:18:55       But I mean, the crazy thing is like, why would you even say that? All you gotta do is just Google it. Just Google it first. You short, you know Jimmy so well in it. But that is, that's leftover. That's the intranet. The intranet is going to fix that eventually. But this is like some leftover legacy shit where people can write. It should be like, you know, there's spell check, there should be like [inaudible] you write something on a message board and Wikipedia, he goes, go fuck yourself. Stupid. That's not true. And it just shows you, it underlines. This is an incorrect statement. You know, it's uh, the Internet is going to cure it. Just like those fuck heads and Kentucky, the stupid kids or their photos or blasted across the Internet today the Internet is going to carry all, you can't eat.

Speaker 11:         01:19:35       They used to do that. So over time in Ohio though like Ohio state, big Ohio State, Michigan Games and shit like that. They would, yeah they would have, you would walk down the street and cars would just be on fire. There would be like people would be a close dumpsters on fire and then they would bomb the whole entire neighborhood with a gas. And so even in your house you're sitting there fucking eyes watering and shit and you just had to like wrap towels around your head. It was certain places,

Speaker 1:          01:20:00       there's a lot of people with some pent up energy and they need to blow that shit out and these dumb fucks had been doing it for like this for so long. But now everybody

Speaker 2:          01:20:08       with their cell phone cameras and shit. Yeah,

Speaker 9:          01:20:09       you can't just do, I'd say did it, it's over. It's over. Getting away with Shin is just over. I mean like I don't, I can't even see like don't, don't get married if you plan on like me and like a cheat Eagle worse and eventually someone's going to put you on blast. Somebody going to take care of your business for you. Yeah. There's no B. There's no,

Speaker 2:          01:20:29       you gotta be integrated today. You've got to be integrated with the hive. You know, you know

Speaker 9:          01:20:35       when wifey can just Google it up. Or if Twitter's your who's talking to him, Twitter and Facebook and look in whatever, there's no privacy, no more as best business when you bought it. I volunteer my information, I'm here and I'm doing this and here's pictures.

Speaker 2:          01:20:46       Right. What do you, what do you think about people that are having to give up their Facebook information to get jobs? Have you heard that? I've heard about it again to give up their Facebook password

Speaker 9:          01:20:56       before and even started becoming a story I used to tell like my nephews and nieces, like I'd see somebody ignorant shit they'd post and I'd be like, Yo, this shit never goes away. Yeah. I was like, there's going to be a time in a day when a motherfucker's going to look to hire you and all of these going to have to do is Google this and bang all that's going to be right in a, in a pre organized section for him.

Speaker 2:          01:21:18       I tried to get rid of my, my space. I try to go with, sorry, they're holding on for dear life. You can't even delete them. I'm serious, man. They were supposed to send me email instructions. I gave him my email address, send me emails, trucks, and had to leave. Oh, I must. Oh, it got lost in the email. You know what they're like, they're like your girlfriend from high school. It's like holding out. She really believes that this whole wife and kids thing, that shit ain't gonna work out. She's mad. She just got to hang in there. Facebook things not gonna last. Facebook is nothing. Come on. My space was huge two years ago before that not been come out. My experience coming back, they really want to believe I logged in the other day. Did you? I did too. I had a it and God knows how long I had that spat about. Uh, the country music thing.

Speaker 9:          01:22:01       I think my, my manager's still deal with it though. Like, cause there's parts of the world where I believe it's still viable. I don't think so. Like, like Russia I think still messes with my space just to give people viruses.

Speaker 2:          01:22:12       It's just a good distribution method for computer viruses. I went there the other day to prove that my dog's name was Johnny Cash. I had to fight. I knew there was a photo of him somewhere, something about Johnny Cash. So I had to find it. And then the only place was on my mind space. Yeah. I forgot. I had a fake band on my space and I found like, like seven songs I wrote. One was called Jujitsu and it was all about Jujitsu and all this other bed. It's called Java lamps. It's still on there. Remember my space, remember what we were going to do with my space for 10 foot screws? Yeah. Did we, what we, one time we were in Denver and it was me and my boy Eddie Bravo. And my buddy Tate and Duncan and, and Brian, and we walked by a wig shop.

Speaker 2:          01:22:52       We just baked fucking around and wander through Denver. Great numbers, a great town. And we see this wig shop. So we said, let's just go ahead and see what's up. For whatever reason we decided to buy these big crazy wigs. So all of them wore these wigs and we pretended to be a band and the band was called 10 foot screws and this is like after my comedy show we w w Eddie Bravo went on stage. We, we introduced him as the lead singer from 10 foot screws and he had the audit, how, you know, let me hear some noise over here. Well like he would go like back and forth with them and he gave out these flyers saying that they were free tickets to the after party and made up an address like 16th street and El Pollo Loco just made up. It was like you had to think something was going on while it's happening because everybody was like, there, there's, this is a stem.

Speaker 2:          01:23:42       And they wore them for the whole weekend. Man. It was just, it was a really ridiculous weekend. But there's a very funny video about it. Is that video out there? How do you find that Brian Shosha seven 10 foot skirts. Google, 10 foot screws. I mean they were, it was re some really funny shit. They had people auditioning to be in the band. I remember that dude that got them to get on his knees. It was, I'm not doing it justice. You have to see it. You have to see the video. I'm going to check it out. Probably won't be so funny to you feel. It's like, you know, if you have a bunch of friends went out and pretend to be standup comedians and trans like a stand out. We've got, yeah, we've done some on the ship and I get it. Life on the road, man. Yeah, it gets weird. Right? Do you go like for long periods you do just weekends and come?

Speaker 8:          01:24:27       No, no, that's, I still go out for a month or two. You know, like, you know at the time, you know, if I got to, you know, if I can do the weekend thing, it's, it's why the acoustic thing is, has been becoming kind of convenient. People are digging on it and it's easy to do. You know, I can travel quicker and move faster. Yeah. When you see a month at a time, is there, is there, is there leg, is it logistically more effective to do a month at a time? Like once you have the stuff out there, your equipment, you just keep moving it. Is that the idea or you just kind of move from one town to the next and is it because it's too difficult to fly all the way revolves more around weekends? You know what I mean? Like music Linebough play Wednesday night, you know what I mean?

Speaker 8:          01:25:07       Awfully Tuesday night. Right. In a town if you know it's, yeah, most comedy does revolve around weekends, but there's a lot of dudes who do like off night gigs. I do a lot of off night gigs for the UFC cause sometimes we'll do like a fight night and somewhere Omaha, Nebraska or some shit on a Wednesday night. So I'll, you know, I'll have a comedy show on a Tuesday night. But um, yeah, music is more of an everyday thing you think? I guess I've just, you know, it just seems like, you know, it's, that's the traveling band man. You gotta keep it moving. I mean they're keep loading in lion like a whole ton of gear just gets old man gets old. You put it in a trailer, you're going to, I mean you gotta still gotta unload and unpacking. So you just drag it around what? You fly it out there once and then you drag it around and bring a lot of times I just rolled the bus up here to la and take off from here. You know? And so now when you do acoustic, all you have to do is fly, right? Yeah. I can fly more, more. I can definitely get around easier. Are you allowed

Speaker 1:          01:26:04       to bring a guitar on the plane? Oh Man. If not, these cases are built for underneath. Really? Yeah. They can take a beating. Let me take a meeting. Did you see that? Uh, ever see that video? United Airlines breaks guitars, uh, after check that one out. I've seen it. Brian, pull that shit up on youtube. It's kind of fall. You're going to freak me out. Now fanned that make made a song about it because they were fucking throwing shit around thinking I don't know about this. Yeah. It's actually not a bad song. It's not my kind of music. But when you, uh, when you think of the context of how this guy had to create it and then create a music video,

Speaker 6:          01:26:41       air lines on my way to Nebraska, plane departed. Hello fax connecting in Chicago. [inaudible] on the ground and passengers said, from seeing behind me [inaudible] my God. [inaudible] the abandoned. I exchanged a look best described as chair at the action on the tarmac and knowing who's projectiles these wounds.

Speaker 4:          01:27:16       The,

Speaker 6:          01:27:20       so before I left Chicago, I alerted three employees who show complete and difference to boards.

Speaker 4:          01:27:30       [inaudible]

Speaker 13:         01:27:32       a,

Speaker 6:          01:27:37       you broke my Taylor Guitar.

Speaker 13:         01:27:41       [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          01:27:47       you are, you broke. You should fix it. I should've flown with someone else or gone by car. [inaudible] United breaks guitars.

Speaker 3:          01:28:06       How many hits video have 11 million. Suck it United. I think they did. I think if I remember correctly, they ended up paying buying new guitars.

Speaker 1:          01:28:18       Uh Yeah. I think he wouldn't take it though. I think he wouldn't take the money. I think they offered it to him, but he said no. He was upset that it took so much and so long for them to pay that they should have just paid him like a normal person should get paid. What you think of stipulation might've been take the video down to yeah, I bet it was. I bet. I bet that's exactly what it was. Of course I wouldn't have gone for that one. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:28:44       One Guitar Bass. You know how much publicity? 11 million youtube hits gets slowly. Shit, I keep getting gigs off of that. Well, yes. I never heard of the guy and it's a good, I mean it's like I said, it's not necessarily my kind of music, but it's a good version of it. That kind of music. It's, he's a good artist. And then I checked out his

Speaker 8:          01:29:02       stuff online. He's likes to sort of like a folksy story. Carol special.com. Yeah, he's like a folksy type of a character. That's funny. If you ever, you never had your shit get broken? No, I've, I've had clothes. I used to run with different cases in this actual guitar that the case like had a hole punched through it and like, luckily it didn't do any damage to that guitar. Ugh. Damn. That must've freak you the fuck out. I was, that's what initiated my second by, I've had this probably about 10 12 years. Mother of Pearl in lays in there. And this is a John Paul Leora Va. He's like Canadian company. They make handmade guitars and that dentists love this guitar. So when is it, how many differently this? I play Gibson, like doves and hummingbirds too. Is it special woods? Like how many different woods are used in a guitar?

Speaker 8:          01:29:51       I don't know dude. It's like, you know, several, but I wouldn't even know. They're like cars. I don't know how the hell they work. I just play him, drive him. I just play him. I'm, I'm, one of the things that facet mates fascinates me the most about acoustic guitars is that it's organic. Like if you're looking at that thing that's just some lacquer or some clear finish over some beautiful natural wood, you know, I love that. I love that that was created by a craftsman. You know, that's not something you could really do with just a, you know, a machine in a hole, punch and spit it out. No, that's a, that's a real piece of craftsmanship, you know? And then I'll just write up here if you're going to get someone to camera. Oh, Angel right there. A love that all mother of Pearl.

Speaker 8:          01:30:34       Right? Is that abalone or mother of Pearl? Motherhood. Pearl. Wow. That's fucking dope. Yeah, I love it. Yeah, that's, yeah, that's not just a musical instrument. I mean, that's ghetto art. That's a piece of art or in a lot of my songs on it. I bet your house. Let's hear another one. What do you got? Um, yeah. Well before I do this next one, I just want to say one of the reasons I asked you to come on this week was, um, uh, I've made it pretty public now that my daughters was born with a, a disorder called cystic fibrosis. And, um, I'm starting to get kind of heavy on the wanting to get involved in the fundraising tip, but, and I'm actually getting involved with an organization called the CFF foundation or the CF foundation, cff.org if you need any facts about what CF is, but it's like, basically I'm a pulmonary and respiratory disorder and we're basically the cells kind of processed salt wrong.

Speaker 8:          01:31:29       And I'm no genius with this. My wife could explain it to you perfectly, but basically it, uh, you develop a whip, much thicker mucus in your lungs than normal and they have to, like, my daughter takes treatments to shake them loose and whatnot. And essentially, you know, that develops over time and kind of constricts the breathing and leads to, you know, um, an early demise for a lot of kids and whatnot. And, uh, but they're doing a lot of really good breakthrough work right now. Like seriously that I could within the next decade a wrap around this

Speaker 9:          01:32:00       thing. It's all privately funded. I'm going to be doing concerts and some other things in the future. But right now we have a team. I tweeted you about it and you retweeted it and the link, I'm sure you can find a link and just throw it up on a thing one more time. We're doing a little walk, you know what I mean? Just trying to get a little kind of thing started. And uh, you know, uh, this next song is kind of about learning my wife and myself learning about this and how we dealt with it. And um, it's called 65 roses and it's cost 65 roses because when children try to say cystic fibrosis, it often comes out sounding like 65 roses. So a lot of the organizations are, are kind of revolve around that theme. But this song is just, it seemed fitting title, you know,

Speaker 4:          01:32:44       [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          01:33:13       men. A bit of wow. Census singing and smash man too long, baby. Who, what went wrong to me? How it got spoiled, Tim, when he went back, had to get back towns we had, we were both young, not spirits were behold. Now we're just saying green. We act like, oh, we can't even talk it out. That one of us walking way.

Speaker 12:         01:33:42       [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          01:33:44       when you reteach agist turns one in. That spreads out the coffin. Girly. You was so fan. Huge was brand new. World did see with some other woman, but I was thinking you knew how it hurts. Knew Howard knew how at Aes, because the hog never heals, was so busy screaming. Don't hear the words that we say.

Speaker 12:         01:34:13       [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          01:34:14       we've taken our lumps, which took a few blow. We hit a few bombs had off fair share, Chad, to see through all of the bag, but on us smells and rich hair. We're not saying you got a bit south. Gotta be strong. Gotta be right. Can't afford to be wrong. It's hard to shake the blues when you [inaudible] worry too much for one cup of the bear. Conga so much for one person to care. We're fooling our families with food now. Read pain. Frustration is hope is a chance. Who was a journey full drug, maybe hopes of vaccine in a race against time. I can get down on my knees and pray. Shouted the devil, Matt, Kirsten, low Rambus them everything I can afford at sell off mass sold that land to see Chad to be righteous. Tragically very of it.

Speaker 6:          01:35:47       the smile on her face, daddy ever thing is

Speaker 12:         01:35:52       [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          01:35:55       police against him. I get down home man. And uh, very

Speaker 12:         01:36:05       awesome. Wow Brian.

Speaker 2:          01:36:10       Thank you. Does beautiful man. How did, how did you change from being essentially like a rap guy? You know when you came out with a house of pain, you were like a rapper and then you became like this blues dude along the way. You know, I think you fucked a lot of people's heads up, but that Whitey Ford Shit, you know, like a lot of people didn't see that coming when you came out with what it's like a lot of people were like, whoa.

Speaker 8:          01:36:37       Um, a lot of it had to do with, uh, you know, a good friend just encouraging me once he heard me doing it, like I used to always play guitar and stuff on, just kind of on the low and the right little ditties and I was recording. I live house of pain and was according with the homeboy and mine and he was home produced a record. This guy, Dante Ross, and he heard me strumming out what actually became what it's like just in his living room. I was playing a guitar and he was like, what is that? And I, and, and he was like, we're going to record it and not trusted him enough to believe it. Okay, let's go for it. Wow. And did you feel like you were pigeonholed as a rapper? That people wouldn't accept it or we, we think of, well, am I remember the label, the label, Dan, they hated it.

Speaker 8:          01:37:21       They were, they didn't, they didn't, but they thought I was really fucking up. Really? Yeah. They thought they thought it was really doing the wrong thing, but you know, God, they thought that thank God that I love when people run like that. I love it. So it's noetic and then I've just fallen in love with writing songs. You know what I mean? I think all the time I've spent as an MC and writing lyrics as a, as a rapper has helped me learn how to craft words in a way that, you know, the song writing is that much better for it. That's true because a lot of rappers, you know, that's one things that rappers don't get enough credit for is the complexity of their versus and compared to a lot of shit that you hear from just singers and songwriters can tire song. I just did a rapper might use that many words in a one verse.

Speaker 8:          01:38:07       Yeah, we know what I mean. He can't, not always. Well, but what I'm saying is you have to learn s through to use the words and use a lot of them. And some not always well but like look at Nas, you know? But you know like, and when you can be even more selective about how many words it becomes easier and no sore in a sense like, oh, I can choose less words and say more because I'm singing and I'm playing this tune with it, you know? Yeah. That's a, that's an interesting place to come from if you really think about it that way because yeah, there's so many more words in a rap song. Like I said, like I said, especially not in us like a soldier boy song. Do you consider that rap? What is soldier boy so like, you know, and the things I'm familiar with my hammer are, are just kinda like chance more than anything.

Speaker 8:          01:38:52       Yeah. It's funny how this shit goes, you know, like that gets stuck in the rap genre. But I mean little John made a career doing that. He wasn't a rat rapper, like come up with good catch little phrases. And have like eight of 'em on a song, you know and know and people scream out when they're drunk and a club mother, fuck yeah. Fuck yeah, we'll host song like that. You know what I mean? Hey, if you want on soldier boy with, there's cats that have been doing it before him, you know? Right. So what did the label should money. Anybody gets money. Good for you. Good money, good money. What did a, would the labels say? They couldn't say much? I was luckily have kind of a big fish on a small label. You know what I mean? Anybody pull you aside and go, you're fucking up kid.

Speaker 8:          01:39:34       No, I didn't. They didn't do wound me aside. He told me blatantly what they thought the words would they chose. We don't think we think you need to choose whether you're a rapper or a singer or it's two different projects. They didn't think it was one project. That's hilarious because I was doing this like, like what had happened was I went to New York and was doing I, I quit house of pain basically in thought I was over. I was just like, music's over now. What do I mean? I mean really come on. What am I going to do now? I just was kind of down and my buddy called me and said screw everything to hell with labels and what not. Come to New York and make some music. And I went out there strictly to make a hip hop records. So I made all these hip hop so every, all the hip hop songs on that Whitey force record. We're done. First they were done and then the other stuff started happening and we were just like, just between me and Jonathan, we kind of were like disco work. If we piece it together. Right. It makes kind of sense, you know, and just made sense to us. Yeah, I remember I heard why it's lagging. I went, Whoa, I get this mother fucker.

Speaker 8:          01:40:36       You uh, took a crazy chance. God, it was the best shit you did. Even though my huge house of Payne Fan, I love that. But I like your singing better man. I mean jump around at all time. Classic period. Always will be there. Louie Louie of the 90s. When Marcus Davis used to fight in the UFC. One of the things I loved, you'd come out to chomp around with a fucking killed on. Yeah. Some other dudes need to come out to that man. I'd say that's a hype up fight music. We need some more Irish fighters.

Speaker 11:         01:41:06       I remember the one that you teamed up with Santana, I it or what's it called? Put, put your lights on. Yeah. That was one of my favorite James back in the day. And that's what really made me go, fuck. Yeah. He, you're legit. That was, that was a good hookup. How'd you, I mean, did you, how did you meet? How did that ever come across? It's

Speaker 8:          01:41:24       kind of crazy cause uh, basically what happened is I recorded that whole Whitey Ford record than this heart thing happened. And I wound up getting surgery, like emergency surgery and woke up from it. And um, found out that I, you know, I had canceled my medical insurance because I have my accountant at the time. It ripped me off for like couple hundred grand in taxes. And so like I woke up from heart surgery, like what my house, like basically on the blocks and the government calling me for money and I was in my house, it was in Laurel Canyon in a Mount Olympus and uh, it was on the hill. You could see the whole city and the house was empty except for me in a chair and I was moving into a little apartment like it was, it was, it was good, humble tack. But I was spending the last night in this house, like looking out as the sun was going down and I had a guitar and I started writing the song and all, that's what that's saying is that hey, now all you sinners, the lights were going, the sun was going down on the city and all the lights of the city were coming on and it was like, Hey, now you soon as, what's your lights on?

Speaker 8:          01:42:29       The craziest thing. As I just told his story at one of these acoustic things, it's something to kind of, I realized recently that I never really talk about much, but like when I was in the hospital after this surgery, like I think hospitals kill more people than anything. Um, from my experience as much as the surgeon saved my life in his tent and all that, the hospital damn near killed me. What do you mean they didn't, you don't rest in a hospital. They tell you get rest, you know this, but every, every other minute somebody coming in and sticking a needle in you and it's never with it's, and even in a great hospital, you know, I was in a great hospital is probably one of the best hospitals in the world. It's still like, it's not nurses that do these things anymore. There's like sub sub sub nurses, nurses, that's all they do is come and take blood from everybody who goes around with his tray everyday.

Speaker 8:          01:43:21       And, but every minute you're always getting poked and prodded and they're doing something to you in that telling you what it is. And like I didn't even get explained about the thing ticking in my chest until like two days after I woke up. Like I'm just, I was going nuts from hearing the sound. I thought, I think I told this story last time about a telltale heart. I was like going nuts. So, but basically there's, you hear that all day, all day. It's like white noise to me now. But yeah, I could take my pulse. Just put that shit up to the mic again. People who haven't heard this need to hear this. That's

Speaker 8:          01:43:58       it's so crazy. Wow. That's, that's some real shit. So one of the nights like I was only, I only stayed there like six days. I was supposed to be there like couple of weeks, but like they let me go home cause I was gonna I was losing it. I was going to die. Nobody will let you sleep. It wouldn't, they just wouldn't let me rest and I was losing, I thought I just, I was convinced I was going to die in the hospital basically. Wow. But the night before they let me go. I was losing it. I mean like that kind of tears where they're just coming out of your eyes and a woman came in this nurse and like was the first person actually just such me with some just humanity and care and be like, oh, it's all right. It's all right. It's all right. And so I was in, it sued me enough that I fell asleep, woke up the next day. I was able to get out of the hospital. I got home. Wow. Couple of weeks later when I was feeling that's what I wasn't. I was like, I want to go back and think this nurse, you know what I mean? Let's, you know what? I made my, my people take me to the hospital because I was still like walking around freely. Can I ask something? Can I get something? This person she didn't exist didn't exist.

Speaker 3:          01:44:54       Do you, he know that you are the guy, the angel.

Speaker 8:          01:44:57       I knew by the way you said it the way you said it was setting up a ghost story. Well, I mean it's about the song. There's an age, there's a monster lives sitting under my bed. That was the noise of me of me. Um, what is this? This is what he's talking. That was the noise, uh, of, of the, of the heart of death. And then the angel with her hand on my head was the woman.

Speaker 10:         01:45:21       Yes. This is a great fucking song. Try that shit up. [inaudible] just say I got nothing to be a [inaudible]. Still got a purpose to serve. [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          01:46:06       damn. My hair was black. Yeah. Isn't that crazy? When you see a white man, it's weird seeing yourself agent that did. That is a crazy look white now.

Speaker 8:          01:46:21       Wow. That's crazy. It's nuts. Seen that song.

Speaker 3:          01:46:27       Yeah. I constantly have to dye my hair and my, that's what my kitchen looks like. Fucking like where you splatter a little bit on your toilet or on your, on your wall and sit down. At least it looks like there's blood everywhere. And My, my path, I just got to own it, man. I can't, I can't just, yes. For

Speaker 8:          01:46:42       mania, man. That's it. I mean, what am I gonna do with the beard man? It's right. Yeah. A lot of life. If he likes it anyway, to me and wife, he it. A lot of guys get in there with a brush and do the whole beard. Ah, I'm go, oh my, Oh, I earned every one of these man. Indeed. Indeed. And I know I'm 42 this is like, remember I've had heart surgeries. I've live eight life so far. Man. I'm good hearing that song. Knowing that story, it makes it so much different. It's amazing. It's amazing how much it fires you up, dude. You were at that. That's, that is the root of all fucking brilliance and creativity is a man with his back pushed against the wall or just fires back. That's the best shit. That's the, that was rough time. That God song is just one of your best songs ever.

Speaker 8:          01:47:24       I mean, you've got a lot of great fucking songs, but that's one of, that's a, that's an all timer, bro. That's an all timer. And when you think about where it came from, you know, do you ever work with Santana anymore? I, I haven't heard from him, you know, quite a while. But how Tom is your old label feel TM, right? Fuck no, they're not in business anymore. That's so whoever the asshole was, it actually said to you as a bad idea when that song came out, boy did that do feel stupid. That record sold a lot of records, man. Is that guy still in the music business? That fucking dummy that gave you shitty advice.

Speaker 8:          01:48:00       It's always amazing when someone who's not up. He's on some like real Deepak Chopra type shit now. Oh, he's like turned in one. He made, I mean I made him good $40 million, man. So whoa. You know, it's a lot of money. You know, saw the guy 4 million records and that's not counting the house of pain records. That's another car. Three or 4 million records. That's a lot of records. Yeah, that's pretty good. Some people who sold them out more, but I ain't mad. I ain't sneeze and that you don't want to be number one man. He just want to be able to buy those Audis and just chill. I like my life. Like I've always told people I like that the music is more famous than my face, man. I really do. Fuck yeah, that's what I say about Steve. What's his name? Cause I'm going to the olive bar like right at the Ralph's down the street after this and get me some olives and some crackers and like nobody will bother me. Yeah, you could sneak Steve Miller. Nobody knows who Steve Miller looks like. Not a person alive that knows a Steve Miller. Looks like they've got, could be anywhere. Yeah. He, Mick Jagger can't go anywhere. You know, not that Steve Miller had ever reached the status of the rolling stones, but pretty God damn successful. You know, he ain't man, I ain't mad.

Speaker 3:          01:49:09       Really hang out at the bar in her. I don't hang out and not olive garden. The olive bar at Ralph's like that where you have all of exotic olives. Okay. Get all, I'd like, I'll heard olive garden. You just heard all and like I said, all the bar, there's that all of uh, there's all of bar also like, or like just a place that's an olive bar. Yeah, it's called the all time actually, but I always call it the olive bar. Oh, it's a restaurant bar that's in Toluca Lake is all into olives and stuff like that. It's got everything. It's like a little whole foods mixed with a bar. I'd have to go check that. A whole foods in a bar together at the restaurant, like that kind of food. You know that good please to pick

Speaker 11:         01:49:48       up vegan chicks. Oh, that's where all the actresses hang out and just sit there and eat healthy and I'm in a de Bouley. What's up? I'm in the olives man. They're like, oh dude. Yeah. What's that about? I don't know if I can tell you about that. Tastes good. I do look on, all of us are disgusting and it's funny that the WWE, I love the album, but I hate olives. Why do you hate olives? They're gross. Have boils. Fantastic for you. Did you always like olives? Did you guys always up? I think that's one of those things that come later in your life where you started liking?

Speaker 8:          01:50:15       No, no. I might dare. I liked him when I was young. I think I just, you know, I like a lot of weird shit though. I like starts thirties loves, I don't like sardines. I like anchovies. Nah, no, I like them like you know, crushed into like flavors I couldn't eat. Just the anchovy don't like, I'm not opposed to some of those things used as ingredients and other things. I'll eat a half a pound of anchovies in a setting. Wow. Will you put it on like a big hunk of bread and make a sandwich out of the war? She had doctor's orders to stop faces and eyes and all I need. Uh, they told me to stop beating sardines cause I had arsenic poison. Wow. Cause I was eating so many sardines. Sardines are just dirty juice. Apple juice and grape juice. Yam. I was like, I was talking to my wife, why don't we ever give her apple juice?

Speaker 8:          01:50:56       And it's like, cause there's arsenic in it and she googled it up and show me grape juice and apple juice. Wow. You know the, the metals, the heavy metals is, it's pollution. That's how the, uh, that's how the sardines absorbed. That's where the flavor comes from. Now, pollution. Yeah. If you think about what lobsters are, man, lobsters are the dirtiest bottom feeders of all time. They taste delicious shrimp too. Yeah, exactly. Do you know what they used to be like in New York? Lobsters were like poor people food. It's like there were so common they used to like get them out of the Hudson river like way back in the day and they would serve him at bars. That's like they would, the big thing that people would serve peanuts. What would it be like? Normal bar food. Like instead of a burger, you get a lobster. It was like poor people food. Easy to cook the throat and boiling water. People crack it open and

Speaker 11:         01:51:43       well, fuck. Look at wood floors. That used to be for poor people yet carpet if you had money, you know, and now I'm ripping out carpet and sing this wood floor that did that. That just has glue and fucking hammers and staples in it. They don't give a shit because back then they were like costing. What's that? Carpet is nasty. Nasty. It's like never changed her fucking clothes. One of the

Speaker 8:          01:52:03       things about like, you know, I live in with this cystic fibrosis thing as we ought to be very, she can't get a cold. I got a two and a half year old daughter. Never had a sniffle. Like a thing about that you have kids, do you have them monitor their diet like oh well you have to, I mean actually no, no, no. With that, with cystic fibrosis it's a constant struggle to keep weight on them. So you're fasting, you're putting, you're loading up fats and and stuff like that. Yeah, it's, it's absolutely new. Our daughter who is like, actually that's her only thing she struggling with is a little bit of weight we're trying to get, you know. But she's like that stage where she just so ran two and a half ran buses and her appetite just isn't huge. And it's like we have, you know, it's a constant battle to try and get, get the weight on her.

Speaker 8:          01:52:45       You have specific high caloric foods that you use server. We just load a lot of things up with extra butters and olive oils and you know, and my wife is constantly, we have two different things like what we eat and watch what she eats. You know what I mean? Like she gets the full fat of everything with the highest calories and we try and eat more of a, you know, lower fat kind of, you know, server like Colby beef and stuff along those lines. Well she started at what? Right for a while she would only eat like two things, man, macaroni and cheese and chicken nuggets and now she's starting to develop actually tastes for other things. I could stitch like a brilliant day when we can get her to eat a burrito and she'd like likes it and like, you know, get these new things because she's starting to get more interested in food hopefully.

Speaker 8:          01:53:26       And what are the treatments? What are they, what do they do for right now our does, she's doing very well. She has no mucus in her lungs. Her lungs are functioning at 99.9 plus, you know, percentage, which is awesome. But she's still, we put her on a, in a vast, that's hooks to a compressor that basically just kind of violently shakes her, you know, and basically what the premise of that is when the music mucus does form in these people's lungs, it shakes it loose so they can expectorated a lot easier. And um, so besides that she did little albuterol like, you know, Kinda like, you know, same as kind of asthma right now just for us, it's all preventative at the moment. You know, our biggest struggle, like I said, is, is just keeping weight on her. Wow. Just getting her to gain and gang because she's, you know, she's very tall for her age, but she's very thin and she needs to be heavier because it, it'll help the lung development developed that much healthier. You know, Brian, your friend Mc Chris also was involved in helping. Yeah, I've been, I've been getting a lot of messages about me and this dude should link up somehow. Great. He's a great guy. And Brian just did a podcast with him and tell me, what did he say Brian About cystic fibrosis? I know that he's a,

Speaker 11:         01:54:37       well, he's calm. He's been, he's, he's amazing. He's, I, I think it's, I believe it's his niece is, uh, has it. And so far, the longest time he's been doing these, uh, you know, shows and he's been doing ebay auctions and stuff in and be good always website also. He has ways that you can help, uh, help the cause. And I asked him the other day how much he's raising. He's, I mean, he's just, you know, a white rapper, nerd rapper, and he's almost, I think he said almost $100,000. He said, yeah, I listened to that part of your podcast. And there was, what was the name of that podcast on, what do you call it? A, we haven't made a name of it, we're thinking muff said, or if it's going to be released on death squad in the next couple of days. So you haven't even named it yet.

Speaker 11:         01:55:19       Now we're asking in the, in the actual episode what we should name it. And there's like, you know, a lot of weird things, but what it is, it's a comic books. Uh, with me, Ryan Kelly talking with comic books. We had a guy that worked at marvel and Ryan steely is a porn star. Yeah. Penthouse pet. Did you know there's lot other, the artists we had, he works on both marvel and DC at the same time. And he does like Conan and Batman. That's awesome. And stuff like that. He's bad ass, but we're going to, what's his name? Uh, Shit you call me. I've got Dan. Uh, but he, he does this thing called drink a drink and draw, which is a new thing that blue with a draw something, it's a really popular app that's on the iPhone, but he has been doing it at bars where you just go and you just hang out with a bunch of people and you all just get drunk and draw at the same time.

Speaker 11:         01:56:00       And now they have it. Citywide were like, these guys like meet up and like these artists and they just sit there and meet each other and then they hang out and started drawing shit on an iPhone. Oh No, no, no, no phones. Just an APP to get them together. No, no, but, but with the popularity of that and it's something that he's been doing, what I was saying is that there's a popular app right now that you're pretty much playing, win, lose, or draw with each other and that's so big right now. But he's been doing it. Yeah, it was that pretty late. It's so buggy. It doesn't seem like they're finished with [inaudible] words on there. Yeah, I know. It's like eight words. I'm confused. All right. He, he's working on something where they get together and they draw. Yeah, like, like, like stuff. There's a lot of, yeah, there's a lot of cities that are doing this where you go to like these bars and just hang.

Speaker 11:         01:56:46       His name is Dan. He's urban barbarian at Twitter. It's called drinker draw and it's just cool. He does hang out and get drunk and, and meet people and you draw and sometimes you have like a little missions and stuff. I'm not really sure how it works. I haven't done it yet. So everybody goes to a bar and they just bring paper. Yeah, they just start drawing. Yeah. And they start drawing and it's really cool if you go to his Twitter page, he has a bunch of shit, but here, let me show you something. He's done like a Batman drawing that he's done that it's going to blow your mind and like how good it sounds like it would be hard to find so many people that are really into drawing, get together at a bro. It's that many people that good at it. Yeah. Drawing is hard. It's gotten so big that it's actually, you know, it's, it's, it's in multiple cities now. It's actually catching on pretty big and with a slight cartooning karaoke or something. Exactly. That's funny. That's a really good way of putting it. Here's this website. Check out this drawing he just did the other day. I drink her draw. I've of the dark night, you know? Yeah. That's some shit I did when I was 15 it's crazy too. They're kind of shit. Yeah. Imagine doing that, getting drunk. Well, you're obviously not going to do it,

Speaker 2:          01:57:47       but I would do it. I still draw, dude. I just draw a lot. That's pretty good. He's very good obviously. Yeah, but no, I mean if I was into comic book art, if I was like really into drawing, it'd be a fun fucking thing to do. I'm sure you know a lot of people find going out and hanging out with people. That's pretty cool. A lot of people find going out and going to bars, like oftentimes it's pretty fucking boring.

Speaker 11:         01:58:07       And this guy is a huge fan of the Joe Rogan Rogan podcast. He was at a big fan. He was so happy to be here at the studio. Oh, that's cool. He's a big MMA fan, but we had him and Mc Chris on the show. It's going to be released next day or two and it's a probably a called something like the warp zone or MF senators until your boy. And He's good at me too. Oh yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:58:26       What is that a, what's that one image that you were just showing the one down, right? Yeah, right there. You just have the cursor. Yeah. What is that?

Speaker 11:         01:58:32       Uh, this is, it looks like a c

Speaker 2:          01:58:36       urban barbarian. He's got to look like a liquor bottle. It says.

Speaker 11:         01:58:40       Yeah, that's his Twitter name. He just tagged it. But he does, if you go to his website, oh, here's one. He did a madmen. Uh, he's done a lot of video game covers. He's also done like a lot of different random things also like movie posters and Shit. Just talented as fuck. Yeah. I used to love comic books room, but I, I just, I've tried getting into him as an adult and for whatever reason I just get, well I tell you the walking dead wants pretty fucking good. That's what I hear. I just, I don't know. I can't get myself to the store to buy it. You know what I did though? I did get an APP on, um, I wonder if I can get the walking dead on my iPad. You care. That's how I read it. The, I got to, oh, by the way, I got the new iPad.

Speaker 11:         01:59:17       Me Now got the new, I've had three over here. What are you doing with that? You're fucking making loans on their file because I wanted the, uh, the four g hotspot. And what's crazy is, is that I did a speed test on it and it was actually faster than the $120 Internet that I have here at the studio. Uh, the speech was quick, quicker on my iPad than it was Jose talking charter business grades, uh, Internet. I don't lose your, your, I got the Verizon, uh, iPad. Yeah, the Verizon. So right now I'm on LTE network is what it says on there. And I have a digital hot spot and now I could have all my shit on that. Of course you're paying for the bandwidth. So they don't have like unlimited bandwidth. I have a card that it's a Verizon on tour with the iPhone.

Speaker 11:         02:00:04       Sometimes I would just make my own little hotspot. They kill you after a couple of days of that, they start hollering messages. Oh yeah, you're going over. Right. It's amazing how little bandwidth you can actually use. I've got a four g card, I put it in my laptop, I downloaded one movie and they'll set, I'd use 75% of my bandwidth for the month. So they send you messages and stuff. So, yeah, the secret is just don't do videos, but if you do anything else but videos, you should be fine. You know, like, like even youtube videos, just wait till you get home because you're going to just kill it. I bet your upstream is not as good though, right? Probably not. My upstream was faster than the charter here. Really? It was only eight. I have a screenshot of it right now. I could tweet, I'll tweet it later.

Speaker 11:         02:00:41       But it's incredible. Yeah. So you really happy with that? Yeah. It was called the screen resolution. I didn't think I was just going to notice a huge difference because this is the retina display and stuff like that. Uh, it's totally noticeable, but when I hold up both my iPad two and the iPad three together, it's, it's night and day different. So that, that was bigger than I thought it was a speed wise. I don't really notice any kind of speed difference. Uh, it's not overheating a lot of reports. I've been saying that the new iPads overheating because it's got like so many dual processors in the retina display and all this shit. But I haven't had any problems with it. Right over your deck and go scrolling. Yeah. That's what happens, right. They get hot. Yeah. Kill your sperm and you don't, you know, there's a big thing that lie to people don't talk about is generic batteries exploding.

Speaker 11:         02:01:24       And I didn't know about this until I went on Amazon in the, if he looks at some of the comments, if you like buy a generic camera for a cam quarter, you know, instead of Saturday for battery, these cheaply made batteries explode all the time. Somebody even like, like commented me on at, uh, something I was talking about in the past that I do, don't buy the cheap version of this. Look what happened to me. And he showed me his pictures of his bed where he was in his bed with his laptop and he had a generic battery in it and it blew up in his, in his bed and it's just blackness all around his pillow. And I was like, Holy Shit, that actually happened to you? And he goes, yeah dude, don't buy the gin. Don't buy that generic shit. Yeah, they do blow up, man.

Speaker 11:         02:02:04       You'll hear about batteries blowing up. It was actually a case for your iPhone. I'm sorry. Now I laptop. It was one of those battery extended battery cases and I was going to buy the mophie one and then he's like, eh, but then I was like, well, I can save $50 by by this generic wine. He's like, don't buy that shirt. I actually was rocking at morphing one for awhile. I'm broke. I got to send it back. Did the really? Yup. What happened? Stop war. Just stopped working and drop it a few times. No, never dropped it or anything, but if you look at the comments, that's one of the biggest things for those mofi cases. It's like, ah, the thing breaks off where you have to charge it or it stopped working so it's not that durable. It's not that durable. Have you seen that new phone?

Speaker 11:         02:02:38       The, it's called the galaxy note. It's 5.3 inches. Yeah. It's like this fucking bit. It's enormous. It's like it's a cross between like a tablet and a phone. They're coming out with another iPhone, iPad. Supposedly. That's going to be that like that. Like a smaller version, like a seven inch version. But it's not a phone. No, no, no, no. I got a phone with the high. Yeah, this has a stylist and you could write on photos or you can write like I'm with stupid and put an Arrow and then put that shit up on Twitter. I mean it's the right on the photo. You take a photo with it. It's like an eight minute that on the IPAD and I can do that on my iPhone. Right? Yeah. You can write scribble on it, man. I'm a killer on the iPhone dude. How do you write with, what do you write with [inaudible]?

Speaker 11:         02:03:14       You can use it. A lot of different programs at the one I use on the iPad for doing that exact same thing is called pen. Uh, hold on, let me look at, you use a stylist, these your finger. Uh, I have a stylist but I never use it. I do. You do use your coke fingernail? It's called pen pencil to meet or something like that. And there's also one color box HD, which is my new favorite drawing. Oh, so you can do the same thing. It just won't happen. Just take a photo or take it from your library, throw it on there tweeting. Some dude brought it to Louisville and I swear for two whole seconds I really thought I was on acid. The guy had this camera and he was coming at me with this, this phone out of my test on a tablet and that's not a camera.

Speaker 11:         02:03:51       That's not a phone. What the fuck is that like? I really thought I was on acid. The phone was so big. I was like, this is beyond the looking glass. I'm Alice in wonderland. You know? I'm like, I'm like looking at a table that's the size of the moon. I was looking at this. They go like that. Gabby. I think the IPAD or the iPhone five when it gets announced, probably in June or or so. I think that's going to be something similar to that where it's maybe not that big, but I really think that it's probably going to be from wall to wall screen. Maybe a teeny bit bigger and skinny. Maybe somebody had liked the size of this the way it is. I mean, not a lot of whole lot of people complain except people that are really into media applications and you can always get an android man. All right. That um, I'll tell you though, that new a ice cream sandwich, the new operating system on Android is pretty fucking dope dude. It's pretty wild there.

Speaker 8:          02:04:38       There's more people using androids now than are even using iPhones. But I think the APP markets not as big in the malware market is through the roof. Way more fake shit and malware and viruses and the nonsense for androids. Everybody who opposed to something on Instagram for her, cause they apparently just let android join Instagram. Right. He posted a picture, he's like, here's for you android users. And it was a toilet with a bunch of gold. That was pretty funny. A toilet with a bunch of gold fixtures. Here's a toilet with a bunch of gold fixtures for all you and bite you. I don't get it. Android is a toilet with a bunch of gold fixtures. Oh, I see. What you're saying. I thought it was funny as now, you know, I'm I rock iPhone because I liked the lenses. My Buddy and rented show show him this.

Speaker 8:          02:05:25       He was showing me this, I'm going to freak the fuck out. I need to get one of these. A friend of mine's father apparently invented this thing called Ipro lands is this case starts with a case and then has this like handle that. You can kind of make until almost a steady cam kind of thing. What? And you just screw on there. But then there's a, a wide angle in a fish islands bill into the handle to handle that is like there's two of them. Take my word for it. You just pull it off, you snap it on and now you got a crazy fish islands and we were taking pictures earlier, uh, with it and it's perfect. Like the dirt, the quality lens is actually, I would say I always saw those, but we really had one of those is his law, his buddy's dad.

Speaker 8:          02:06:07       It's a, both a mutual friend of ours, like basically the Lux model with the handle and shit. [inaudible] have the handle. He probably just doesn't use it.

Don't put the wings on to, we could totally do this way more often. People love you. Aww, I love you. I'm so happy. You know, mandate. A lot of love came through the podcast man and, and you know, if you got an extra buck,

Speaker 8:          02:13:32       if you don't, it's all good. You got to ask you again. Um, I don't know the link off hand, but uh, just hope that y'all will tweet it out again. It's the cff.org. There's a great strides. Is the name of the organization where the Schrody family team, um, you know, that's, that's, you know, you know, we were trying to get our team, obviously the donations, but even if, you know, if you just sent them a donation that's fine too. But we got, you know, we're, this is a little walk we sponsor every year and, and you know, we liked doing it and I said, yeah, like I said, I got, I'm be hitting you up in a lot of other cats, you know, for, in the future we're going to try and put together some events and really do some, I'll do anything to get this thing wiped out in the next five years and then we'll move onto the next thing.

Speaker 8:          02:14:13       And this is all a lot of privately financed. Yeah. There's no government funding whatsoever for it, man. It's complete private donations and it's also ranked like as one of the top charities in the world as far as getting like, it's the high 80th percentile on how much every of every dollar gets into the researchers actual. When you are so closely, uh, you know, you're so closely involved with something like this. Does this drive you crazy when you see like that Coney Shit? Like you know when you yo, no, no because you know, I mean it's, it's not a horrible thing for everybody to jump on the bandwagon of, you know what I mean? The back does a cystic fibrosis is such a rare thing, you know what I mean? It's like my, my, in order for my daughter to have it, both I and my wife had to be quote unquote carriers of this.

Speaker 8:          02:15:01       We had no idea, cause I've looked back through generations of my family and generation of hers and it has to be both. It has to be both. If there's one of us that didn't, it will, it will. And you know, there's, if I have more children, there's a one in four chance that that child will have cystic fibrosis. So that's a, that's a whole nother thing. But no, it doesn't bother me man. There's room for every, you know, everything needs help. I mean like honestly I'm at that is a scandal involving the call, the dualistic guy who ripped off a lot of people. Oh No. Huge percentage of the money went to him and his organization. Is that why they found him naked in the like crazy. That's a shame. That's a shame. Well, my attitude in general is like, look man, this is, this is my priority.

Speaker 8:          02:15:39       I don't expect the guy out there who maybe he's might be dealing with a child with something else cancer or, or down syndrome. I expect them to, to just, I'm doing my part and I'm saying, Hey, if you got an extra 50 cents and and missing and five songs for you today, maybe touched you a little something. You know, I just the other day from throwing it down on Twitter, a couple thousand dollars from complete strangers and there was a lot of $1 there was and you know what? Don't think that doesn't make a difference. That's appreciate. I know how hard times are that $1 debt. That means not even more. There's people who get $500 I was tripping. I was like, these are strangers, man. You know, and I wrote on Twitter, the kindness of strangers is, you know, overwhelming. It's beautiful times and it makes them feel so good to, people don't know if they've never donated something like that.

Speaker 8:          02:16:24       If you really want to, this is something we could, I'm, I honestly believe in the, and there's things going on right now. This thing can be, it's a genetic disorder. So technically you can't really, all you can do is treat it, but they can treat it to the point where it's nullified. And that can happen in our lifetime and these kids won't be dying in their thirties. And you know that up until recently, the median life span is 35. Wow. And so that's, you know, and that's what I read instantly when my child was diagnosed. But it's changing every day right now because the science every day is getting so much better. So we don't know now because we haven't seen what these effects of had on these youngsters, man. So I mean, I'm, I'm guarantee you that you would, did lifespans are already being, being increased daily.

Speaker 8:          02:17:05       But this thing could be like put to bed honestly within the next 10 years. If the right money and the right things are found in it and it's one of them things, it's one of them. It's like such a complex genetic thing. I, I'm not gonna try and s tell you details about it because I'll sound like a Maura, but it's one of them things that attracts the most brilliant minds. It's one of the puzzles that the most brilliant dudes want to figure out as far as into medical fields. You, you get the cream of the crop. And like I said, cff.org is one of the organizations like 88 85 to 89% sign of every dollar is getting to the researchers. It's not, it's not getting chopped up and you know, they, they're documented is one of the best charities in that sense. That's beautiful.

Speaker 8:          02:17:44       See F F. Dot. Org folks, we're going to put this great strides. You know, there's walks all over the country too. You could start your own team and, and raise your own bread and you know, if anybody feels like doing it, you know, and I saying we're going to have concerts and we're going to do all kinds of things. But right now that we're sponsoring this walk, I'm in F. Dot. Org folks, uh, yet we're going to put it on Twitter too. If you forget it from today, if you're listening in your car, put a direct link to the Schrody family teams so you could dedicated or like you know in the name of Layla are beautiful, healthy, so far a young daughter and, and hope to keep her that way. Yes,

Speaker 1:          02:18:16       we'll throw that up on Twitter and we'll get as many people

Speaker 8:          02:18:19       and thanks for all the love. And literally last time I came on I got more love. I've never, ever, I've done a lot of shows, I've done a lot of things do. I have never seen the reaction I saw for coming on the show. This

Speaker 1:          02:18:28       is a, this is a beautiful group of people out there, man. A Beautiful Group of people that have tuned into this show. And I don't, you know, I don't know how it all happened, but, uh, I feel very, very fortunate and I think Brian feels the same. It might have something to do with all those cookies, sugar, cookies, sugar cookies are motherfucker, man, real hard to tune into it. We're trying real hard to tune into it and we want to, we want everybody else to tune into it to together. I believe that we can truly be a better group of human beings. All of us can win, absolutely. Buyer each other. We push each other forward. And if you get enough people that think a certain way, it doesn't, you don't lose hope. You do know that there's people out there that got it wrong, but there's also people there that got it right. You could find them. You know, you could live your life like a Goddamn episode of Nancy Grace and only look for the shittiest things every goddamn day and really freak yourself the fuck out. And that's, that's true and real. Or You could live your life. We need together a lot of money, man, and make

Speaker 2:          02:19:28       a network and just have it be the good news network. Yeah, no shit. I bet you would be a huge success, man. Yeah, exactly. We will. We have 7 billion people on this planet. We concentrate on the most horrific thing. There's a lot of good news, man. You wouldn't know it. You're right. You're right. And that would, that would feel good news. How would you, if you came home from the end of the day, wouldn't you? Wouldn't you just be glad to be like, let me just see some good shit happening in the world. Turn that on for 45 minutes. Exactly. We were constantly afraid of danger. We have information that's coming to us from places we'll, we'll never physically be and yet we'll still worry about it. And I bet you there's good news from those places too, that we're not being told bad. Yeah. Motherfuckers keep us in the dark.

Speaker 2:          02:20:10       Right. Hey Gel. Um, can I say real quick? Me and Joey Diaz are doing a short little Midwest tour. Yeah. What is that? It's now on sale. I, it's a may 17 two will be in Columbus, Ohio. May 18th will be in Cleveland, Ohio. May 19th will be in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. You got a death squad. Dot TV right at the top it says death squad mini tour for all the links so that tickets, me and Joey Diaz. That's awesome. This is your first time on the road or like with a comic life Joey too. Yeah, just you and Joey and just me and joy. Wow. How much time are you going to do? Like 1520 and that Joe is going to just go off for an hour and a good Joey. A lot of those little five hour energy drinks. He loves those as wow. That's going to be fun.

Speaker 2:          02:20:49       So what are the places? Just it's on death squad TV. Yeah. Death squad.tv. We're playing the woodlands tavern, that garage shop and the Mullens in Pittsburgh. Oh, so you're doing bars like it's like stand up style, like small menu music stuff too. That's great stuff. It's going to be fun. You're going to, where was I was on tour. We were somewhere and we went to a restaurant and it was like, you know how to half a bar? I'm like, we were really good restaurant too. I can't, I think it was in Chicago in Italian spot and like a comic just started like, I guess they were having a comedy night and there's a few common standards just like got up in front of cats eating dinner and like, I don't even think people were expecting comics to be there. Like in there. Maybe it was their girlfriend and they just went at it and I was just like, man, I don't think I could do that.

Speaker 2:          02:21:31       Uh, that's rough business man. Trying to get a laugh out of cats that it was like got a mouthful of food and like looking at you like, what the hell are you doing here? And I've done that shit. I used to do a waiting room. I did it only once the GIG was canceled, but it was a waiting room of a, of a restaurant and this is the first day they were going to have it. It was a huge restaurant. And what they had, they had two big gigantic places in Massachusetts, like down by the Cape. They have these giant restaurants, they're mad like preposterously big. I did it again, boom drink. And in the middle of it there was like a place where they would have a stage for a band. So people would be like waiting, like waiting for the table, it'd be called.

Speaker 2:          02:22:09       And you just go on stage out of nowhere. I mean, I don't even remember if a Dj introduced me. I don't know what had happened. Um, you know, telling these ridiculously fucking dirty jokes, you know, to a bunch of strangers and right when you're about to hit the punchline Johnson table of three year, your table's ready. Can you come to the front? It was on the same PA system. That's my PA system for telling jokes was on the same PA system as the tape. It was. That was, that was one of the most ridiculous like carrying us rough business. Anybody who gets somewhere in comedy, man, I just like, I think it's referred in the fight game, man. You got to have a particular, you've got to have a particular sickness, like a fight game. If you're really truly talented, you might only have to fight two or three fights in some real shitty organization.

Speaker 2:          02:22:54       As a comic, you probably got to like early on, dude. I mean like, well there's some guys will tell you, you should never get out of a shitty situations. You should always stay in the muck because if you ever get too soft and get to a, you know, you only preach to the converted and you don't go out and do like some sleazy little places and seed. Second Dingle. Yeah, there's a, there's a very real vibe that you get off a real small crowd. It's a different vibe, especially a small crowd. Dennis, totally different thing. If I were to stroll into a bar and start playing songs, it's not the same. Even if it's total strangers dead like you know, like say a dead call, just show up and do it. It's a totally different beings in your, it'd be way more accepting of short music in the background and listening to you playing.

Speaker 2:          02:23:34       I'd be like, Oh yeah. Then like you're engaging people as a community and like directly, like I want you to laugh at what I'm saying. It's very arrogant to, and most people, you know, you see a person there on stage and your first reaction is why should you be the guy talking? What you that I'm going to give up the position. I'm going to sit back and just let you run my thoughts with your loud amplified mouth. That's offensive, especially when you're not very good at it and when you wanted to just go to a bar and have a drink and some fucking guy who was not very good, it's up there saying a bunch of shitty jokes, man. That's how we learn how to do it takes balls of steel man, very tart. It doesn't matter how good you are. It takes balls of steel.

Speaker 2:          02:24:13       The fry, it's a fun Gig. It's a Joey Diaz says. He said it's the hardest, easiest thing you'll ever do. That's the best way to describe it. I think if you get good at it, it becomes easy. It becomes fun, but it's hard to stay up. It's hard to stay good. It's hard to stay in that frequency, you know? Yeah. That's, that's true of a lot of stuff. Yeah. It is right. Creativity. Right. And if you don't keep it moving. Yeah. And flowing. Yeah. I always feel like that. Yeah. I always take too long and don't write some music. It becomes very hard to kickstart it and get it going again towards going to be a level I'll, I'll be acceptable on. That's why I buy mannequins. Yeah. That's how to do it. Brian, have you ever read the war of art? I don't think I am.

Speaker 2:          02:24:55       Great Book About Killing Procrastination, about making you right. Making you, uh, get, get shit done or do heart sounds like something I'd like to read. It's a really good small short book. It's, it's per people, even people that aren't artists, it'll, um, it'll get you motivated to just get shit done that you've been procrastinating. The way the guy puts it. It's really, he says his name is Steven Pressfield and he wrote a, a bunch of books. He's a pretty famous author, a lot of like historical novels and stuff. I think, I believe he's a famous for, but he's,

Speaker 1:          02:25:24       uh, he's also famous for being like really prolific and he's super honest and I spoke about how he was a fucking loser up until he was like 40 years old. And it just like, he couldn't, couldn't fucking get it together. It couldn't work. He couldn't just, and he's, he just kept failing and then finally figured out how to just become a professional, how to really become a professional and fucking work. And when he did that, everything changed. Completely changed. And he's like super honest about it and super honest about, um, what, what, what holds you back? The resistance. He calls it resistance, like the lazy procrastination, all the self destructive shit that people do to avoid doing things that they know that they should do. And the way he puts it is really a quite brilliant and it's a very, it's very inspirational. Book. It real small too. If you're not a big reader, the war of art, we'll get you cause it's nice and small. Um, thanks everybody man. Thank you. Everlast thank you. Always come back again. Anytime we're going to, we're going to have to do more of these problems.
