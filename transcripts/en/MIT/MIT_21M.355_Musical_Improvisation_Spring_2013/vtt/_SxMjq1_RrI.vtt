00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.607
PROFESSOR: OK, so let's move
into are our topic for the day.

00:00:31.607 --> 00:00:32.940
So we've got a couple of things.

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.750
We're going to talk a little
bit about In a Silent Way.

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.530
And then I want to
have us have a chance

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.600
to present what
you have created.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.290
And we'll see how this goes.

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.630
So this is pretty much, at least
in the second part, unknown.

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:49.450
We don't know what's
going to happen.

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:51.030
So it should be interesting.

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.560
But in terms of In
a Silent Way, did

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.010
everybody get to listen to that?

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:02.030
And what do you make of
that composition, called

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.349
In a Silent Way by Miles Davis?

00:01:04.349 --> 00:01:06.699
What do you make of that?

00:01:06.699 --> 00:01:07.865
What did you hear happening?

00:01:12.478 --> 00:01:16.006
AUDIENCE: It seemed modal, so it
didn't have any definite chord

00:01:16.006 --> 00:01:18.730
changes, which I think
gave it sort of like a,

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:20.747
like, spacey
ambiguous feel to it.

00:01:20.747 --> 00:01:21.330
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.829
Good.

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:24.229
Modal, spacey, ambiguous.

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:24.770
Anybody else?

00:01:27.734 --> 00:01:30.698
AUDIENCE: A lot of the melody
and things were also ambiguous.

00:01:30.698 --> 00:01:34.650
There were a few clear
themes that would repeat,

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.550
but there was a
lot of just sounds.

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:39.630
That was cool.

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.586
PROFESSOR: Sounds, OK.

00:01:42.586 --> 00:01:45.040
AUDIENCE: The instrumentation
was just very different

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.122
from the other Miles Davis
pieces we'd listened to,

00:01:49.122 --> 00:01:51.800
and the style and
everything, like it being

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.590
so like a slow, laid-back,
almost free-flowing piece,

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.372
with a more I guess like
electronic feel to it.

00:01:58.372 --> 00:02:00.202
But that was interesting.

00:02:00.202 --> 00:02:00.910
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:03.130
And because, what were
some of the accompanying

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:04.523
instruments in this?

00:02:04.523 --> 00:02:07.241
AUDIENCE: It sounded maybe
like a synth, I want to say.

00:02:07.241 --> 00:02:08.150
Was that a synth?

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:10.160
PROFESSOR: Fender Rhodes.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.644
Actually, two
Fender Rhodes piano,

00:02:11.644 --> 00:02:12.810
which is sort of old school.

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.140
But you see these around a lot.

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.390
In fact, we have
one at MIT, which

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.960
the current pianist
with the FJE likes

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.700
to call it out and play it.

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:21.710
So that's great.

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:26.590
And somebody playing the
organ, as well as that.

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:27.090
What else?

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.590
What else did you
hear, instruments?

00:02:39.436 --> 00:02:41.060
AUDIENCE: How prominent
the instruments

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:47.102
were to one another was more
uniform than the recordings

00:02:47.102 --> 00:02:48.510
we've listened to.

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:49.540
PROFESSOR: Meaning?

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.774
AUDIENCE: Like, it's not like
that obviously the trumpet

00:02:53.774 --> 00:02:56.490
had the lead the whole time.

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:59.050
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:00.990
So a lot more diversity
of who is sort of

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:02.850
in the lead and
that kind of thing.

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:07.260
Was it only that sort of
ambiguous free floating sound?

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.080
Was it only that, are
did it do something else?

00:03:23.016 --> 00:03:25.496
AUDIENCE: Well, after a
few minutes [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:36.890
PROFESSOR: OK, a regular beat.

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:40.655
And what was the
rhythmic feel there?

00:03:40.655 --> 00:03:41.530
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:45.957 --> 00:03:47.790
PROFESSOR: But I mean,
was it jazz, was it--

00:03:51.785 --> 00:03:52.660
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:03.404 --> 00:04:04.320
PROFESSOR: Percussive.

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:05.380
OK.

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.050
Anybody else have
a term that could

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:09.600
characterize what it went into?

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:20.154
We all heard the piece, right?

00:04:20.154 --> 00:04:22.490
And it was a fairly
long piece, right,

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:25.130
like about 20 minute piece?

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:27.757
OK.

00:04:27.757 --> 00:04:29.090
I was sure you would catch this.

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:32.320
It goes into essentially
a rock kind of a feel.

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.282
It's a more subtle
rock feel than what

00:04:34.282 --> 00:04:36.490
you would have heard from
a rock band in that period.

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:39.250
But nonetheless, that's
what it's going to.

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:42.160
This became sort of
the signature piece

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.540
that moved jazz into what was
called jazz rock or fusion.

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:49.270
In 1969 is when this came out.

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:51.620
And in fact, this middle
part is the longest part

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.170
of the whole piece.

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:56.230
It's where most of
the soloing happens.

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:00.630
And then it returns to this sort
of quieter, more lyrical thing

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:02.020
at the end.

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:03.580
And I put these
names of the board,

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:07.050
because it turns out
that this is actually

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:10.900
a piece that was put
together in the studio.

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.460
It's a studio realization,
you could say.

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:15.770
And the first part is
called In a Silent Way.

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:18.210
That's composed by
Joe Zawinul, who

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:20.584
was one of the three
keyboard players.

00:05:20.584 --> 00:05:22.500
That shows up at the
beginning and at the end.

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.000
And in the middle is a piece
that both Zawinul and Miles

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.380
Davis co-composed, called
It's About That Time, which

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:31.137
is the more funky,
rock type of piece.

00:05:31.137 --> 00:05:36.900
And so they decided to
essentially blend these pieces.

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:38.622
And the further
thing about this is

00:05:38.622 --> 00:05:41.450
this was an early
attempt by people

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:44.080
in the studio, one guy in
particular, Teo Macero, who

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:47.917
worked with Miles Davis a
lot, to essentially sort

00:05:47.917 --> 00:05:49.750
of you could say cut
and paste, because they

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:52.897
used to have to splice tape
to make cuts and paste them

00:05:52.897 --> 00:05:53.480
back together.

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:55.310
It's before digital editing.

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:56.990
And so there's
some of that that's

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:58.860
going on in the middle section.

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:02.470
And in fact, the last
section is exactly what

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:04.310
was played for the
first four minutes.

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:05.390
It's just a replica.

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:06.390
It's a replication.

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:10.490
It's the same exact music
just pasted in at the end.

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:14.090
So it sort of calls
into a new perspective

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:18.105
what is improvisation and what
is jazz composition, really.

00:06:18.105 --> 00:06:19.480
And you're going
to have a chance

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:21.210
to talk with Neil
Leonard when he comes

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:24.850
in about another month about
exactly that, electronic usage,

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:26.880
computer usage, and
improvisation stuff.

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:29.490
But this is sort of
an early attempt.

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:31.845
The other thing that I wanted
us to listen to this for

00:06:31.845 --> 00:06:37.360
is that this basically is a
jazz version of the format

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:41.980
that we're going to hear on
Sunday at the Indian concert.

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:45.090
Because how many people have
had the Music of India course?

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:46.310
Anybody have that course?

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:47.360
You've had that.

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:48.400
Anybody else?

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:51.700
And so you know that the way
that the music in the Raga

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:56.730
tradition works is there's a
very slow presentation, as it's

00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:59.610
called, of the raga,
the main melody.

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:02.800
And then after that is
allowed to be stated

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.250
in a very lyrical,
free floating way,

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:09.030
then you get this rhythmic
sense with a particular cycle

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:11.370
or a tala that comes in.

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:16.400
And so it's hard to believe that
Miles Davis was not influenced

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:18.420
by John Coltrane,
who had previously

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:19.824
been part of Miles' band.

00:07:19.824 --> 00:07:21.240
But Coltrane, as
many of you know,

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:24.180
had explored the music of India.

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:27.210
And so it's sort of
like a cross influence

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:29.490
coming back from what
somebody had originally

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:32.610
been a player in Miles' band
coming back to inform him.

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:37.640
And this piece really has a very
Indian at least pattern to it,

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:39.010
if not Indian music.

00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:43.210
It's not a raga, but it is
its own particular mode,

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:45.330
as people have said.

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:47.260
Anybody know what mode
it was, or did you

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:48.310
try to figure that out?

00:07:59.068 --> 00:08:02.980
AUDIENCE: Was it,
could it be in Dorian?

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:10.510
Because it began with a flat
[INAUDIBLE] 7th, I think.

00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:11.570
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:15.120
Anybody have a
different take on it?

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:25.415
AUDIENCE: I figured out
which notes were in the mode,

00:08:25.415 --> 00:08:27.235
but I don't know if I
could remember them.

00:08:27.235 --> 00:08:28.859
I was playing along
to it, but I didn't

00:08:28.859 --> 00:08:31.606
think about what
the actual mode was.

00:08:31.606 --> 00:08:33.730
PROFESSOR: OK, but you
tried to play along with it.

00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:34.055
That's good.

00:08:34.055 --> 00:08:34.680
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:37.820
I feel like I figured out
which notes that actually fit.

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:40.890
AUDIENCE: Anybody remember what
was going on at the same time

00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:42.265
that the melody
was being played?

00:08:56.026 --> 00:08:57.400
So obviously I'm
going to suggest

00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:02.360
you go listen to it again, so
we can hear more deeply inside

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:03.860
of what's going on.

00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:05.860
Let me just come over to
the piano for a second.

00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:08.430
I made a brief transcription
of this melody.

00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:10.570
And what's going on
is-- if I can just

00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:14.550
get over there-- the
first thing that we

00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:16.620
have with this is a drone.

00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:20.062
A drone is just a long
note underneath the melody.

00:09:20.062 --> 00:09:22.020
And we've done that with
some of our exercises,

00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:26.130
right, where we've just
had a basic tonal center.

00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:28.700
I didn't call it that,
but that's what it is.

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:29.910
Same thing in Indian music.

00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:33.410
There's a drone established
by one of the instruments.

00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:35.260
And then the melody
works off that.

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.751
So in this case, it's
an E. [PIANO PLAYING]

00:09:37.751 --> 00:09:41.540
So you're always hearing this
E, and then it's actually,

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:42.520
this is the melody.

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:47.720
[PIANO PLAYING] It
starts on the third.

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:49.609
If you were in E and
you had E major chord,

00:09:49.609 --> 00:09:52.150
it's actually the third of the
E major chord. [PIANO PLAYING]

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:53.630
But you never get that chord.

00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:54.480
You just get this.

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:57.214
[PIANO PLAYING]

00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:10.010
PROFESSOR: And that's
a big interval.

00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:11.620
That's a minor seventh jump.

00:10:14.362 --> 00:10:17.230
And here's where you get the
tip off of what the mode is.

00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:19.918
[PIANO PLAYING]

00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:29.630
PROFESSOR: And what that
is is E to D natural, which

00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:38.750
means that it's E essentially
mixolydian, because if you had

00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:45.540
come on that same phrase
and gone [PIANO PLAYING]

00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:52.552
it's totally different.
[PIANO PLAYING]

00:10:52.552 --> 00:10:54.920
And it winds up on
the fifth, which

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:58.740
is the B, which is
again an open sound.

00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:01.670
So except for occasionally
getting a major third of what

00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:03.890
might have been the
chord, it's really

00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:05.730
ambiguous, which a
number of you said.

00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:07.250
Yeah, Jamie, you had a point.

00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:09.084
AUDIENCE: Yeah, it's
funny because the piece

00:11:09.084 --> 00:11:11.458
that I wrote, which I wrote
after I listened to the song,

00:11:11.458 --> 00:11:12.420
was in E mixolydian.

00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:14.740
So obviously that
transferred over.

00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:16.620
PROFESSOR: Deeply
influenced by this piece.

00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:17.170
And that's great.

00:11:17.170 --> 00:11:17.885
AUDIENCE: So I
knew as soon as you

00:11:17.885 --> 00:11:19.435
played that, that
was E mixolydian.

00:11:19.435 --> 00:11:20.310
PROFESSOR: That's OK.

00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:21.850
That's how we learn.

00:11:21.850 --> 00:11:25.470
And that's a great homage
to this particular piece.

00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:32.440
So what we've got here, in other
words, is a pretty simple mode.

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:34.170
It's just one.

00:11:34.170 --> 00:11:36.350
And it almost sounds
like it's major,

00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:38.890
except for that little trick
note that I pointed out.

00:11:38.890 --> 00:11:40.809
But that's a very
distinctive note.

00:11:40.809 --> 00:11:42.350
And so when you
listen to this again,

00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:44.670
pay attention to that,
because it really

00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:47.140
is the thing that
sets this piece off

00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:49.020
apart from many others.

00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:50.740
Now the interesting
thing about this

00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:54.390
is according to
people who have really

00:11:54.390 --> 00:11:55.980
studied this and
interviewed people

00:11:55.980 --> 00:12:01.030
who were on the recording
session, when Joe Zawinul, who

00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:03.950
wrote this tune, the one we just
talked about, when he brought

00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:07.572
this into the recording
session, he had chords with it.

00:12:07.572 --> 00:12:10.820
He had chord changes
written for it.

00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:14.540
And Miles Davis
saw this and said

00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:16.430
to the guitar player,
John McLaughlin,

00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:19.600
why don't you just
play the melody?

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:21.505
And it sort of took
McLaughlin aback.

00:12:21.505 --> 00:12:23.880
It was like, well, what am I
going to do with the chords?

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:25.010
And the piano player
said, what are we

00:12:25.010 --> 00:12:26.176
going to do with the chords?

00:12:26.176 --> 00:12:27.910
He said, don't play them.

00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:32.260
Just-- Dave Holland was
the bass player-- just

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:36.360
put a E pedal underneath
all of this, play the melody

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:38.870
and let that be the whole thing.

00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:42.390
And so according to these
people again at the session,

00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:43.960
they did this.

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:46.080
And no one was sure how
it was going to turn out.

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:47.455
And when they
heard the playback,

00:12:47.455 --> 00:12:51.980
they were just astonished,
because it made so much sense.

00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:54.870
And this is sort of the next
level after Kind of Blue.

00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:57.020
In fact, it was 10 years
after Kind of Blue.

00:12:57.020 --> 00:12:59.360
So it's sort of like
moving from that,

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:01.240
building on that
direction, incorporating

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:03.650
some Indian-ish
type things with it,

00:13:03.650 --> 00:13:05.360
and coming out
with what we have.

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:08.310
So I really do recommend
you listen to this again.

00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:11.310
Try to hear some of these other
things that are happening.

00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:15.320
And when you hear the middle
section, this other tune,

00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:18.660
it's called It's About That
Time, pay attention to this,

00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:20.955
because this now shifts
the tonal center up

00:13:20.955 --> 00:13:24.900
a half step to F. Some
people say it's mixolydian.

00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:27.270
I hear it as a pentatonic sound.

00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:29.154
So see if you can maybe
play along with that.

00:13:29.154 --> 00:13:31.320
That would be a good one
to play around and just see

00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:33.240
what you can figure
out on the bass-line.

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:35.480
And that's all it
is, is a bass-line,

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:36.839
with a lot of textures.

00:13:36.839 --> 00:13:38.380
Remember, we've
talked about textures

00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:39.370
from the other instruments.

00:13:39.370 --> 00:13:41.578
And this is particularly so
with the three keyboards.

00:13:41.578 --> 00:13:45.520
So it's a great piece, and
it bears listening to again.

00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:48.360
OK, so the assignment
for you guys

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:52.720
was to come up with a piece that
was similarly a long flowing

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:55.500
melody of between
10 and 15 notes,

00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:59.210
and then figure out
a way to present it.

00:13:59.210 --> 00:14:05.600
So who would like to
present their piece?

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:11.340
AUDIENCE: So the melody sort of
goes like this. [BANJO PLAYING]

00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:14.930
That's just sort of the thing
that we're going to play around

00:14:14.930 --> 00:14:19.875
on, is this.
[BANJO PLAYING] And there's

00:14:19.875 --> 00:14:28.780
a second part that will come in
occasionally. [BANJO PLAYING]

00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:32.461
Just like that, which
is that second part.

00:14:32.461 --> 00:14:32.960
Alright.

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:34.760
So why don't you, ah--

00:16:02.910 --> 00:16:04.620

notes that you

00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:07.266

what it was made out of.

just like the--

PROFESSOR: The
little melody notes

00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:15.080
that you would play it around.

does that sound like?

00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:32.190
What kind of music
does that sound like?

00:16:32.190 --> 00:16:33.230
AUDIENCE: It does kind of
sound like Indian music.

00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:34.440
PROFESSOR: It sounds
like Indian music.

00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:35.884
Have you heard
much Indian music?

00:16:35.884 --> 00:16:37.008
AUDIENCE: Oh, yeah, before.

00:16:37.008 --> 00:16:37.920
That's what I thought of.

00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:39.435
PROFESSOR: So it must be
going into your consciousness.

00:16:39.435 --> 00:16:41.101
AUDIENCE: Yeah, at
one point I was like,

00:16:41.101 --> 00:16:42.450
oh, it sounds a little Indian.

00:16:42.450 --> 00:16:45.580
PROFESSOR: So when you
hear the concert on Sunday,

00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:50.090
what you're going to hear is
something very similar to that.

00:16:50.090 --> 00:16:53.280
That'll be the presentation
of the raga, that sort of idea

00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:54.470
that you just did.

00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:57.470
And in fact, when you got
into that rhythmic thing,

00:16:57.470 --> 00:17:01.240
particularly your picking
style, as well as piano,

00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:03.830
that would be very similar to
what the tabla, the drummer

00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:07.109
would be doing, to give
a percussive thing.

00:17:07.109 --> 00:17:08.270
So this is great.

00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:10.290
This is like
unconscious processing

00:17:10.290 --> 00:17:11.359
of where we're going.

00:17:11.359 --> 00:17:12.300
So brilliant.

00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:14.859
And very nice playing
on the saxophone.

00:17:14.859 --> 00:17:16.980
Very nice.

00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:19.569

what would be called

the characteristic feature of
the mode or if it was a rag,

00:17:23.470 --> 00:17:25.619
there's certain
particular things.

comes a week from-- well,

00:17:28.510 --> 00:17:29.960
it'll be on next
Monday-- he'll be

00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:33.330
talking about that very
particular, specific thing.

00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:35.190
So very well done.

00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:36.174

like to go next?

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:46.390
AUDIENCE: It goes from D
dorian, G mixolydian, C major.

00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:49.080
So piano should
be playing chords.

00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:52.730
And then the melody, I was
thinking flute and oboe

00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:54.409
could maybe improvise
on part of it,

00:17:54.409 --> 00:17:55.700
like when you get to the major?

00:17:58.610 --> 00:17:59.495
That's C major.

00:18:03.401 --> 00:18:03.900
Yeah.

00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:05.960
There's not really time to this.

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:09.120
So I sort of suggested
which notes might be shorter

00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:11.010
and which ones might be longer.

00:18:11.010 --> 00:18:12.960
But take whatever time you want.

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:15.280
That's why I figured
maybe it's not best time

00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:18.620
for lots of people
playing at once.

00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:22.745
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] sort of
loop around a couple times?

00:18:22.745 --> 00:18:24.900
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I think
once would not be enough.

00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:28.600
So maybe let's do
two or three times.

00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:31.450
And I'm going to sit this
out, because transposing

00:18:31.450 --> 00:18:34.190
and to keep it quiet.

00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:39.944
So I guess flute and piano,
whenever you're ready.

playing the actual melody.

00:20:57.190 --> 00:21:00.380
And you were improvising
within the mode, or something,

00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:01.660
or around it.

00:21:06.904 --> 00:21:09.336

AUDIENCE: I've got a
simple melody which

00:21:15.350 --> 00:21:20.160
I'd like again to be
played by the flute.

00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:22.700

00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:27.950
I didn't explicitly say what
notes were longer than others.

00:21:27.950 --> 00:21:32.790
But in the middle there
I've got these three notes

00:21:32.790 --> 00:21:35.822
which I kind of wanted everyone
to get in on, specifically.

notes specifically,

00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:39.426
like those exact notes?

AUDIENCE: Oh, yeah,
specifically those notes.

00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:44.530
So everyone play like
in unison, or as you

00:21:44.530 --> 00:21:50.520
get further along, yeah.

00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:54.026

all play the whole time,

00:21:54.026 --> 00:21:56.150
but those three notes, we
play the notes in unison?

AUDIENCE: Everyone's
playing the whole time.

00:21:58.530 --> 00:22:00.770
Maybe at the start, actually,
the first time through,

just the piano.

around, then you guys come in.

I'm just showing that because
this would be another way

00:27:46.461 --> 00:27:48.380
to make a variation
of what you'd done.

similar to Silent Way,

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.770
you've got your
lyrical thing up front.

And then you could turn it
into a rhythmical gesture,

could take a solo
on top of that.

about in terms of extension.

didn't put a meter with it.

to say a thing about chords.

this is your piece.

So I don't want to say anything.

00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:34.770
But you had said
D Dorian, you also

00:30:34.770 --> 00:30:38.400
put D minor, D minor
chord, to indicate

00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:40.740
you wanted a D minor chord.

00:30:40.740 --> 00:30:41.420
And that's fine.

00:30:41.420 --> 00:30:42.520
That's perfectly fine.

00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:47.590
Sometimes-- and you see this
on the lead sheet for So What,

00:30:47.590 --> 00:30:49.750
which we looked at,
and we've studied it--

00:30:49.750 --> 00:30:52.790
it'll say D Dorian D minor 7.

00:30:52.790 --> 00:30:56.100
It's a shorthand for
saying that's a chord that

00:30:56.100 --> 00:30:58.200
works with the D Dorian scale.

00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:01.400
But in fact, it's often
not so good to use this.

00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:03.552
It's much better
just to put the mode,

00:31:03.552 --> 00:31:06.010
because if you do that, then
the piano player's immediately

00:31:06.010 --> 00:31:09.060
going to think, let
me play that four note

00:31:09.060 --> 00:31:12.300
chord, which is triads.

00:31:12.300 --> 00:31:14.330
And triads, remember,
is not the sound

00:31:14.330 --> 00:31:15.770
that we typically
want with modal.

00:31:15.770 --> 00:31:19.750
We want a quartal, like
a fourth base thing.

00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:22.710
So when people do this and
they put that down there,

00:31:22.710 --> 00:31:26.291
sometimes you're sort of
snapped into that other way

00:31:26.291 --> 00:31:26.790
of thinking.

00:31:26.790 --> 00:31:27.850
It's not that it's wrong.

00:31:27.850 --> 00:31:33.310
It's just not quite
into the idiom

00:31:33.310 --> 00:31:35.400
of what we're trying
to do with modal stuff.

00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:36.610
So OK.

but you can definitely

00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:49.520
change that, especially
after the first run-through.

you'd start out just

00:31:52.335 --> 00:31:54.562
like emphasizing the D and
any other notes basically

00:31:54.562 --> 00:31:56.790
you feel like, and
then you can basically

00:31:56.790 --> 00:32:00.255
transition to the
melody yourself

00:32:00.255 --> 00:32:02.730

us, if we could

00:34:23.130 --> 00:34:25.232
make the presentation
just a little bit shorter,

00:34:25.232 --> 00:34:26.940

was like the flute

to just like start the
melody and just keep

00:34:44.389 --> 00:34:45.590
looping back through it.

00:34:45.590 --> 00:34:46.940
And it has a rhythm.

00:34:46.940 --> 00:34:49.540

piano to just, I guess,

off that melody?

were making that up,

that's who they often
would listen to.

00:36:51.980 --> 00:36:52.480
Wonderful.

00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:54.980
And I'm getting a kick out of
the fact that most of you guys

00:36:54.980 --> 00:36:56.460
are not playing
on your own piece.

00:36:56.460 --> 00:36:57.460
That's very interesting.

00:36:57.460 --> 00:36:59.168
Because you want to
hear what's going on.

00:36:59.168 --> 00:37:00.000
I understand that.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:03.115
AUDIENCE: So basically
I would like the guitar

00:37:03.115 --> 00:37:05.860
to start off playing the
melody and kind of set

00:37:05.860 --> 00:37:07.840
up a cycle of some sort.

00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:16.690
And then I'd like Sarah to
improvise over his melody,

00:37:16.690 --> 00:37:19.710
but starting with notes
beginning from right to left,

00:37:19.710 --> 00:37:20.480
if that's OK.

00:37:24.127 --> 00:37:25.069
I hope it works.

00:37:25.069 --> 00:37:26.490
I'm not exactly sure yet.

00:37:26.490 --> 00:37:29.080
And then I would like
you to play, I guess,

00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:32.450
whatever cycle he sets up if
you could just play chords

00:37:32.450 --> 00:37:38.448
under it, but I guess I'd like
half to be your own, yeah.

PROFESSOR: That was very nice.

00:39:03.430 --> 00:39:04.971
And actually I think
it's interesting

00:39:04.971 --> 00:39:08.280
how these are just
emerging, just

00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:11.200
by the way people
are volunteering.

00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:14.390
But this sort of could
be a perfect complement

00:39:14.390 --> 00:39:16.005
to what your piece was.

00:39:16.005 --> 00:39:17.380

going to play the melody,

and the rest of
us will just play

00:39:28.430 --> 00:39:31.321
like soft chords in D Dorian.

00:39:31.321 --> 00:39:32.880

specific rhythm,

liberty you want.

00:41:26.140 --> 00:41:31.210
So where I was doing B
Dorian on the sax, that

00:41:31.210 --> 00:41:33.580
should have been a
G sharp, I think,

00:41:33.580 --> 00:41:36.200
so I just made that change.

have anything written down.

that, because that's often

said write it down.

is perfectly fine.

us a generative point

what you had on paper.
