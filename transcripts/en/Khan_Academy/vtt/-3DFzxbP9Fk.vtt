00:00:00.736 --> 00:00:03.399
3 flowers bloomed yesterday

00:00:03.399 --> 00:00:05.411
and they draw the flowers 1, 2, 3

00:00:05.431 --> 00:00:09.174
6 more bloomed today. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:00:09.814 --> 00:00:11.942
How many flowers bloomed?

00:00:12.402 --> 00:00:15.680
Well 3 yesterday, 6 more today. So you're going to have

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.946
the 3 from yesterday, plus the 6 more today.

00:00:19.726 --> 00:00:22.146
Well what's 3 plus 6 equal to?

00:00:22.996 --> 00:00:28.031
Well 3 plus 6 is the same thing as 6 plus 3 and that's going to be 9.

00:00:29.121 --> 00:00:32.374
6 + 1 is 7, 6 + 2 is 8, 6 + 3 is 9.

00:00:33.654 --> 00:00:37.523
And it's good to know, just in your head, 6 + 3 is 9. 3 + 6 is 9

00:00:37.523 --> 00:00:39.442
or you could even count them......

00:00:39.442 --> 00:00:42.663
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

00:00:43.483 --> 00:00:47.199
Let's do another one.

00:00:47.849 --> 00:00:50.012
There were 2 sharks. 1, 2.

00:00:50.712 --> 00:00:52.936
3 more sharks came. 1, 2, 3.

00:00:53.576 --> 00:00:55.725
How many sharks are there now?

00:00:55.855 --> 00:00:58.834
Well there's the 2 that were there before.

00:00:58.994 --> 00:01:01.707
Plus the 3 that came.

00:01:01.957 --> 00:01:04.035
So, there's 2 plus 3 sharks.

00:01:04.255 --> 00:01:06.156
Well, what is 2 plus 3?

00:01:06.156 --> 00:01:08.092
Well, 2 + 3 is 5.

00:01:08.092 --> 00:01:10.779
2 + 3 is 5 and you could count it. 1,2, 3, 4, 5.

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:14.712
Let's do one more.

00:01:14.982 --> 00:01:16.845
A squirrel picked up 7 acorns.

00:01:17.095 --> 00:01:19.525
(counting) 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

00:01:20.235 --> 00:01:22.400
She picked up one more acorn.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.218
Find out how many acorns she picked up.

00:01:25.528 --> 00:01:27.158
Well she picked up the 7.

00:01:27.458 --> 00:01:30.533
Plus 1 acorn. So it's going to be 7 plus 1 acorns.

00:01:31.473 --> 00:01:33.727
And that is equal to 8.

00:01:33.727 --> 00:01:35.793
(counting) 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

00:01:38.553 --> 00:01:40.481
You got it right.
