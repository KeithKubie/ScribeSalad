I'm here at the Autodesk Gallery today in San Francisco. There are some really

00:00:04.158 --> 00:00:07.460
great objects here that have been made with the aid of computer graphics. Jesse

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:11.194
Harrington Au is here today to explain what these objects are about. So Jesse,

00:00:11.194 --> 00:00:14.108
first of all, what's your background? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; : So, my background's actually in

00:00:14.108 --> 00:00:17.790
industrial design. A long time ago, I was an illustrator. And then I started

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:21.309
doing these crazy exhibits, and weird things in warehouses. Started getting

00:00:21.309 --> 00:00:24.522
involved very early on in the maker movement and then went back to school for

00:00:24.522 --> 00:00:28.760
industrial design. Started doing product design, then do a little exhibit design

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:33.080
and that's fortunate enough to get picked up by autodesk. And where I get to

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.765
make a bunch of cool stuff around young entrepreneurs everyday in a place called

00:00:36.765 --> 00:00:37.263
tech shop.
