that's the bigger challenge

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810
 
 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.340

absolutely dwarfed by united states
 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.410
absolutely dwarfed by united states
trade with africa i do think that the

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.999
trade with africa i do think that the
United States ought to engage

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009

actually paying attention to Africa it

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220
actually paying attention to Africa it
 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.279
actually paying attention to Africa it
had all African heads of state come to

00:01:43.279 --> 00:01:43.289
had all African heads of state come to
 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:44.569
had all African heads of state come to
visit Beijing which is something we've

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579
visit Beijing which is something we've
 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.270
visit Beijing which is something we've
never done and so and they are building

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280
never done and so and they are building
 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.609
never done and so and they are building
schools and roads and all that and that

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619
schools and roads and all that and that
 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:50.960
schools and roads and all that and that
part of what they're doing is great the

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970
part of what they're doing is great the
 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.029
part of what they're doing is great the
problem is that they are also embolden

00:01:53.029 --> 00:01:53.039
problem is that they are also embolden
 

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:55.190
problem is that they are also embolden
assump ritty horrible regimes there and

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200
assump ritty horrible regimes there and
 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.630
assump ritty horrible regimes there and
I think we we and more importantly we

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640
I think we we and more importantly we
 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.800
I think we we and more importantly we
combine with other powers like the

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810
combine with other powers like the
 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.230

European Union and Japan ought to be

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240
European Union and Japan ought to be
 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.649
European Union and Japan ought to be
trying to convey to China why we have

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659
trying to convey to China why we have
 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.930
trying to convey to China why we have
the rules in place that we do that that

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940
the rules in place that we do that that
 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.780
the rules in place that we do that that
for example try that thai loans to

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790
for example try that thai loans to
 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.270
for example try that thai loans to
getting rid of corruption I think China

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280
getting rid of corruption I think China
 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.979
getting rid of corruption I think China
is really on a learning curve here and I

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989
is really on a learning curve here and I
 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:21.440
is really on a learning curve here and I
think that they will ultimately go along

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450
think that they will ultimately go along
 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.170
think that they will ultimately go along
with well let me see I think that they

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180
with well let me see I think that they
 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.990
with well let me see I think that they
will ultimately learn that giving money

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000
will ultimately learn that giving money
 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.610
will ultimately learn that giving money
with no strings attached could backfire

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620
with no strings attached could backfire
 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.699
with no strings attached could backfire
at the end of the day but I'm not

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709
at the end of the day but I'm not
 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:33.410
at the end of the day but I'm not
worried about I'm not worried at all

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420
worried about I'm not worried at all
 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.140
worried about I'm not worried at all
about China taking Africa away from the

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150
about China taking Africa away from the

I think for the average individual in
 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.900
I think for the average individual in
China life is a lot freer than it then

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910
China life is a lot freer than it then
 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.970
China life is a lot freer than it then
it used to be certainly that most

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980
it used to be certainly that most
 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.190
it used to be certainly that most
average citizens can work where they

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200
average citizens can work where they
 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.600

they can travel more or less freely and
that's very different from the China of

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610
that's very different from the China of
 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.690
that's very different from the China of
30 years ago and a lot there there's a

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700
30 years ago and a lot there there's a
 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.009

reliant on the government to be able to
 

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:50.259
reliant on the government to be able to
continue to function and so they do a

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:50.269
continue to function and so they do a
 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:51.940
continue to function and so they do a
lot of self-censorship and that's

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950
lot of self-censorship and that's
 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:53.890
lot of self-censorship and that's
basically how it works but if you look

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:00.849
of that is done through text messages
and through the internet so it's really

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:00.859
and through the internet so it's really
 

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:04.449
and through the internet so it's really
a tool that is very hard to completely

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:04.459
a tool that is very hard to completely
 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:06.699

can do that through various technical
 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.250
can do that through various technical
means of getting around the blocks but

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260
means of getting around the blocks but
 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:16.930
means of getting around the blocks but
overall the Chinese government does a

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940
overall the Chinese government does a
 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:23.270
overall the Chinese government does a
very good job of censoring

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280
 
 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.940

what its trajectory is that they are
 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.030
what its trajectory is that they are
ultimately very pragmatic and that if we

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:36.040
ultimately very pragmatic and that if we
 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.980
ultimately very pragmatic and that if we
apply pressure in the right way

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:37.990

especially working with other countries
 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:41.820
especially working with other countries
to apply pressure that we can actually

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:41.830

it will only perpetuate the possibility
 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.650
it will only perpetuate the possibility
that they could become that enemy and

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:52.660
that they could become that enemy and
 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:54.300

and then we would you know we would
 

00:09:09.939 --> 00:09:11.790
and then we would you know we would
write chapters together so it kind of it

00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:11.800
write chapters together so it kind of it
 

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:13.530
