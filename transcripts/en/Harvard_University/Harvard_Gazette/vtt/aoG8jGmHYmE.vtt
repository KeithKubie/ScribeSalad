00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:20.680
Laredo consists of about 270,000
people, 95-96 percent Hispanic.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.420
We're known as the number one land port.
International trade is huge here in our city,

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:32.180
we do over 214 billion dollars
worth of trade. We're very interrelated

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:38.100
socially, economically, toward our sister
city, Nuevo Laredo, in the northern Mexican region.

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.140
What is troubling or puzzling to
me is that the unemployment rate here in

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:49.600
Laredo, Texas, is lower than even the
national and state but yet the poverty

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:55.100
level is is 32, 33 percent and it's
been like that for... since I can remember,

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:01.820
and this is why now we're
taking a closer glance at it and to

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:07.070
see if we can identify the primary
indicators and then measuring those

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:13.060
through data, then managing and producing
some sort of an action plan.

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.580
I'm here in Laredo as a
Bloomberg Harvard fellow tasked with the

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.869
challenge of mapping poverty across the
city. I've been interviewing different

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:37.680
organizations inside the city government
and outside, so that I can get a sense of

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.040
the challenges that they're facing, a
sense of the challenges that the

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.660
community is facing. Where do people live;
where they go to school; what type of

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.500
food do they get access to; how do they
move around the city; and what type of

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.640
transportation do they use? What type of
weather and environment they face every day,

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.710
and I'm trying to put all of that
information together so that I can

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:04.600
create maps that describe the challenges
that the community is facing,

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.440
and especially those with impoverished
conditions.

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.280
We know what the Census Bureau statistics tell us

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.200
but we don't really know what single individual is

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:19.560
dealing with in their homes, in their
circumstances, in their lives. We haven't

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.239
made any assumptions. We've really left
it open so that the data can tell us the

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.280
story, and then we can retool what we're
doing and how we're doing it

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.640
Laredo is not the only city that's
facing the specific challenges regarding

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.740
poverty that it has, but the overlap of
government entities at all levels

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:52.380
meaning local, state, and federal, from one
country, and the other make it a very

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.420
complex theater of operations.

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:26.340
Out of all of the
households in Laredo, forty percent are single

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:31.580
parent households. Thirty-four percent of those
are single female-led households.

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.660
Trying to understand that phenomena drew us into
health data.

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.660
Another hypothesis we are pursuing is

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:50.400
the City of Laredo is
structured in a very different way than

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:56.160
other cities. In the 19th Century
there was a plan comprised of grids, but

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.990
the infrastructures that service the
border and service both nations came in

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:06.980
and segmented this grid. It's basically a
contradictory condition where we have

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:13.050
all these bridges connecting two nations,
but we have elements that actually

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:17.120
fragment the the city in the other
direction.

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.100
I was privileged to be able to

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.580
be at the forefront of the work group
that is bringing forward some very

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.680
interesting findings for you tonight.

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.040
My name is Santiago Mota, I'm a Harvard grad student

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.960
I'm studying at the Graduate
School of Design.

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:35.940
What was more or less the average /education of single females households?

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:41.200
Well these single female households start early. They have kids early.

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:42.940
What I do want to say is that

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.460
there is a great display of
responsibility in the data through

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:52.140
practices of women's health and that was
present in the Department of Health data.

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:56.160
And so what have other cities done to
address that and making it less

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.120
expensive to be mobile.

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.240
It all starts
with public transportation

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:06.360
and the way that the public space is
designed and implemented, there's a stark

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.000
lack of sidewalks for example and shade.

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:13.280
Spending time in Laredo has been incredible.

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:17.760
Being able to ask tough
questions to city officials, to have

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:23.490
access to their data, extract meaningful
data points, to contribute to a larger

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:28.499
explanation, has been invaluable.
Understanding also all the pressures

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:33.020
that they are facing as a local
government, has been extremely interesting.
