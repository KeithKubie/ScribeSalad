00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.340
In this lesson, we'll use Microsoft's HealthVault, but

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:06.180
there are several widely used PHRs and

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.920
they mostly do the same things. You should already have a HealthVault account,

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.820
but we haven't yet explored it to see how it stores clinical data and

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.339
what it can do to help patients use that data, including sharing it with others.

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.192
So here's some of my health data. I manually input in HealthVault.

00:00:24.192 --> 00:00:30.570
You can see key data such as allergies, conditions, and medications.

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.520
As shown here, users are aided in recording this data by smart lists that

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.710
appear as they type. More recently, as meaningful use has dictated

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.410
the export of at least standardized clinical summaries from the provider's EHR,

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.620
the burden on the patients to record all their data is largely alleviated since

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:56.480
the PHR can and should import these summaries from all providers caring for

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.240
the patients. To aid that, note that I now have a direct email address.
