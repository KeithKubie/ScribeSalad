00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:06.560
Hey, what's up guys Iâ€™m out here with Devin Graham, aka, Devin Supertramp aka make her exceptional quality digital content

00:00:06.568 --> 00:00:08.280
And you have any idea what we're doing here today

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.950
We are going to make something awesome, and it's gonna be random and I'm doing it with the king of random

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.229
So that's what I'm guessing my hypothesis. He has no idea what we're doing today. No idea. What's making it up?

00:00:19.229 --> 00:00:19.720
We are making super shooters these things are pocket slingshots powered by [balloons]

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:20.220
You don't really want to use anything harder than a marshmallow because as innocent as the

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.820
se look it does pack quite a punch and can do A lot of damage so [a] big marshmallow little one. Yeah a little tiny marshmallows, so you can hit me from here to here

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:36.660
Yeah, I can get you there. Oh

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.749
I love my life flash before my eyes. Let's do this [oh]

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:51.239
Good look that's the t-shirt that [is] stuck to your shirt. Wait. Let me hit you again. Yeah, sweet, and I like this guy [oh]

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:54.100
Yeah

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:59.039
No, I'm definitely hurt. Let's see it. See that guy's that is from a marshmallow

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.879
Marshmallows will leave welts, okay. I'm a second dog poop. Oh

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.069
Grant is stepping in dog poop to make this work. All you're gonna

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.019
Need is some kind of a juice bottle drink bottle soda bottle whatever what we're looking for is one of these wide mouths cap

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.010
so if you go down to the store

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.079
You're gonna see a huge variety of different caps

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:22.409
You'll see white caps black cabs purple caps yellow caps red caps pretty much anything you want so I tend to lean toward black caps

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.419
They work really well pretty much with any color of [balloons], so I'm using the powerade. Oh, dude. Where'd it go?

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:32.939
We just [lost] a bottle I'll dive in ahead. Are you gonna try? I don't know if you can see it. Maybe grab

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.829
This is like poop infested duck pond. So you

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:40.539
Wow

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.289
I don't think we're gonna be drinking that all about the shop though, all right

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:47.229
I [check] this out guys so depending on the size of pocket slingshot

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:52.059
You want look at the tops of the bottles you can see gatorade is a little bit bigger than the powerade and the power it

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.210
Is more than normal size of what you're going to find on juice containers and everything else

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:01.089
so if you want a bigger slingshot gatorades the way to go this is not a sponsored video second contact exact go

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:22.210
And this guy actually won. I wasn't even close okay. It's time to cut the tops off the bottles choose your weapon

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.230
I'm Gonna go with [the] saw okay

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:25.540
He's Gonna take a saw

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.540
We'll try out the [sooners] and let's see what the difference is

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:29.799
You see how it kind of slopes in there's a gap

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.339
And [then] there's that flat part of the neck if we want to cut it so it's exactly flat

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.729
I'm not a good cutter. Should you be doing this? What's the worst that could happen?

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:41.230
Success, I didn't screw it up

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:47.020
We have the capitated bottle and you can see how this is nice and flat that [is] exactly what we want right there

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.540
But it's a little bit dirty. We need to clean it up and for that

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.269
We could use just the natural environment around us

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:57.070
Maybe some concrete or if you happen [to] have some maybe a little sandpaper will go a long way bring it everywhere I go

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.929
So just follow along you learn how to sandpaper with me. That's kind of what we're known for on our channel

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.449
While Devin's working on that I'm going to show you how you can do with a pair of scissors. This is not recommended

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:10.449
This is actually very dangerous, but it will work

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.660
I just wanted to show you that it will work, so get your bottle on a flat surface

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:17.110
punch into it like so and

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:23.110
[man] that's really hard plastic this will actually work better on one of those bottles like the Gatorade or powerade

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.860
Bottles, but it will work

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.250
with a pair [of] scissors as you can see

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:35.709
So just get it roughed off, and you can see it's going to leave quite a bit around the edges there

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.669
But that's not a big deal you [can] take your scissors and kind of do another pass and clean it up. Oh

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.070
shoot

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:46.809
Mine's a little bit sticky, so I'm just gonna wash it off there to clean it up a bit

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.229
But essentially that's what it's gonna. Look like and unfortunately with a pair of scissors

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:56.290
That's about as good as it's gonna get hey guys good. Wow, how did yours turn out Gonna? I'm gonna turn that awesome

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.629
Do that service it's actually mine is like super smooth the question is can I get it out?

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:05.560
And I guess I can so we're about to put the balloons on we got a bag of balloons

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.560
You can grab [bagg] from the dollar store or your party supply store

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:13.689
So Devon's going with the black and red I'm going with kind of this Goldish orange and a black cap

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:18.640
That's [gonna] be cool. But before you put your balloon on the cap. There's a black band on here that needs to come off first

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:25.030
This can be tricky yeah, yeah, don't cut it. Do not cut you not cut it we want that band

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.149
We want to preserve so just dig your fingernails down [in] there

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:31.210
And take a success

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:34.119
Definitely guys [all] [right]. So now that we got our caps prepared

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:38.679
We've got our balloons picked out the next thing to do is to modify them and we're gonna come up about a quarter to [half]

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.680
Inch up the neck of the balloon and just slice it

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:47.470
Make a clean cut well that's actually pretty terrible job, but I've seen better excuse me. I'm not gonna Lie. I've seen better

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.560
Whoa like a Doc

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:52.780
[try] [to] see if this does it oh

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:56.470
beautiful flawless

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:01.270
Okay, teamwork that is what it's supposed to look like just take your [cap] with the cut part them on the top

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:06.549
I guess we're just [gonna] [open] that balloon up wrap it around so that the top edge of the balloon is

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:13.689
Pretty much exactly flush with the top of that bottle top. I've got wrinkles in mine, so I'm just gonna work those back

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:18.520
[we] want to get rid [of] all those wrinkles. Okay? I think I got a really good actually [okay] cool

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:21.399
So now look at the balloon and see how well centered it is when it holds up on its own

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:26.770
Great. That's like a pretty good [debit]. I'm impressed. Thanks all right now remember that little black band

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:32.590
Yes, replace the little black band so now after our black band is back in place if you take your thumb

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:36.190
And just gently roll it back. You can see it's going to roll that rubber back

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:42.339
And it's actually gonna fit right into that groove of that bottle thread. It makes it look super clean super professional

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:43.900
Here's the trick you just take your thumb

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:45.880
[and] just kind of glided around and then it all

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:49.630
In there and see how it's kind of like a rounded Ridge which gives a little more bulk

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:53.890
So now when you pull the balloon. It's not going to pop through because that [rim] holds it in place check it out guys

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:57.669
We are finished Devin's got his red pocket shooter. I got my orange pocket shooter

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:02.800
You can see if you look straight [down] the balloon is pretty much centered mine's a little off, but it's not bad though

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:03.190
Yeah

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:05.440
now I have to do is hold it with your thumb and finger and

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:10.059
you can even nestle it in there in the webbing of your thumb, and then pull it straight back and then

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:12.910
Shoot it

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:18.220
Now when you're done using the slingshot this is the coolest thing you can wrap this up put a little bit of ammunition in there

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:20.980
And then you can actually screw the cap back on and it makes this little

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:25.600
Compact puck that fits perfectly down into your pocket. No one will know that you have a concealed weapon on you

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:31.420
So it's super portable. It's very inconspicuous, and it's just a lot of fun. There's the cat stuff

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:32.530
I wish I had when I was in Grade school

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:36.220
[not] that I'm saying that you should take these to grade school times have changed

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:40.510
I just had a random thought I wonder if we could use this thing to shoot marshmallows out for the duck Steve

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:45.459
I'm not talking about shooting the actual ducks. I mean I like trying to hit them no no shooting marshmallows for them to eat

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:48.040
Brilliant

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:54.280
[oh], I took the bait if you were to look down through the center of this thing you'd want to see it snap exactly through

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:54.920
that hole [in]

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:59.349
Contrast if you're off a little bit it might snap up and hit your finger or snap down and hit your hand you don't want

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:00.400
That so it is Gonna

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:02.210
Take a little bit of practice to work on your Aim

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:06.369
If you're a little bit nervous about hitting your hand you could hold it just between your thumb and your finger

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:10.359
Try that way as well. It's just a little bit harder to hang on to [alright] guys

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:15.790
So just for contrast we're gonna do a [gatorade] bottle. [there's] no bad ideas here, but there's definitely no good ideas here

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:18.840
Sorry, I'm not doing [a] very good job. Oh

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:23.649
[it's] like the best one we've done yet not too bad

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:29.260
[and] then we've got like a wider mouth [does] [a] [team] [work] so [grantees] pulled out like 30 of these out of his back pocket

00:07:29.419 --> 00:07:32.769
No, big hail, so now we got some money. What should we do with them battle?

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:36.220
Any last words. I think you're Gonna Miss I

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:44.740
Could tell because you have glasses on your eyes are protected, so [I] say we just do one no

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:46.740
That's straight on no, no

00:07:48.169 --> 00:07:50.169
No

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:02.650
You know I got like seven in here. We're going shotgun effect. Oh

00:08:04.639 --> 00:08:06.639
Did he leave welts oh?

00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:10.899
Oh good [good] shot. That was good shot. It was kind of cheap shot

00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:12.380
It was I had no bullets

00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:16.119
And he shot me [when] I had nothing to fire about this is I had one stuck in there

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:18.160
I just wanted to like get it out there for sure ah

00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:27.429
Nice nailed it nailed [Devin] awesome. I am surprised. How far these things are flinging now look at that

00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:31.750
I think it's not as hot maybe yeah the sun's gone down so marshmallows will work

00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:37.030
You just got to get the right conditions to see you walking [back] check that out. Huh watch the bushes. What's it?

00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:41.780
See that it's amazing. [that's] a marshmallow. So what we have learned though

00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:48.589
Is it definitely does get things way too sticky if you start screwing around [now] these things may seem fairly innocent

00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:53.840
But they do pack a real wallop. So [we've] got a few little rocks here, and the bottle blasters from a previous project

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:58.399
We're going to see if it's powerful enough to make these targets explode. They really do sonic booms yeah

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:05.940
Okay, Devin's up

00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:10.170
Yet is she like super good

00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:15.870
and one job oh

00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:21.239
That one is the bottle you need a sharper one and hit a little bit harder

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:30.209
[I] saw my life flash before my eyes I

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.960
Didn't get out loud so with this little contraption

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:38.879
We shoot a well with a 20 ounce bottle maybe a little bit bigger about this day well 500 milliliters

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:44.880
And we're talking like pieces for days like well fit into the week

00:09:45.490 --> 00:09:52.440
So we're gonna spend the next two or three hours cleaning up this mess that we made when this stuff is everywhere and like

00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:56.400
That's not normal took me a while to use of the marshmallow rocks

00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:02.999
Though are like guaranteed fatal so like I'm stoked on [this] so to take this up a notch. We're using sidewalk chalk

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:08.309
We're going to crush this down and go powder to give our exploding targets a little more color [a] [little] more zest if you will

00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:15.559
I think we got a winner

00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:23.370
There we go. [I] don't think we want to go much more than that

00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:32.850
Okay, update guys, so we got [a] huge [exploding] target filled with chalk dust behind [it] we each have one rock

00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:37.529
We're gonna shoot these at the same time and see we get this first try. Yeah alright here. We [go] guys for the win

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:41.219
three two one

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:47.999
First try you got that right [I]?

00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:50.980
Wasn't close was I?

00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:53.699
Actually, I was one the nails [hey], you'll never know

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:56.860
So what's the deal with the salt?

00:10:56.860 --> 00:10:58.949
So I use this salt for killing flies

00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:02.850
You can use these those fly shooters like in the house or enzo and [yarn], just pour a bunch of it

00:11:03.070 --> 00:11:04.080
That's probably enough

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:07.199
You don't need a whole lot, but this acts kind of like is a shotgun effect

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:11.400
So if you get a fly on the wall or [on] your computer or something shoot a little salt at it

00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:14.430
So kill kill fly it'll knock it on a commission. Yeah

00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:20.040
Whoa, it's pretty good actually legit. Yeah. It's like a shotgun effects everywhere

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:24.149
You gots alright here if you want to give her the flies in your backyard or your house

00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:26.759
You got marshmallows which are all over the place?

00:11:26.830 --> 00:11:31.980
They're tasty and the good thing about these is they don't hurt [people] too bad as long as you get them in the stomach

00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:38.159
They will be welt it will leave looks more dangerous options Airsoft BB's will work these will punch through cardboard

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:42.749
And then of course steel BB's these are probably like the real no no these will do big damage

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:47.490
Do not shoot at people or property or any living thing don't shoot ducks or children?

00:11:48.190 --> 00:11:54.270
So before we let you get out of here devon. There's something everybody wants [to] know what [do] you look like with your hat off?

00:11:55.240 --> 00:12:00.689
The world will never know. Oh come on pick it up pick it up yes. Yes. Yes

00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:08.609
Being naked oh the devon grammars ville you saw it here first folks out here first Grant Thomas [Ed] live uncut unedited

00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:14.340
Unrated if you want a team [supertramp] hat you can go to the devin supertramp [web] [site] if you want
