00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.820
Hi there, I’m John Green, this is Crash
Course: World History, and today we’re

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:10.680
gonna talk about the Silk Road, so called
because it was not a road and not made of silk.

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:15.080
So this is a t-shirt. It was designed in Belgium
and contains cotton from both Brazil and the

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:20.140
Texas, which was turned into cloth in China,
stitched in Haiti, screen-printed in the Washington,

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.350
sold to me in Indiana, and now that I am too
fat to wear it, it will soon make its way

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:27.670
to Cameroon or Honduras or possibly even back
to Haiti.

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:31.150
Can we just pause for a moment to consider
the astonishing fact that most t-shirts see

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.440
more of the World than most of us do—

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:37.199
Mr. Green Mr. Green the t-shirt can’t see
the world because they don’t have eyes—

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:40.960
Look, me from the past, it’s difficult for
me to isolate what I hate most about you because

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.449
there is so much to hate.

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:46.170
But very near the top is your relentless talent
for ignoring everything that is interesting

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.429
and beautiful about our species in favor of
pedantic sniveling in which no one loses or

00:00:50.429 --> 00:00:51.819
gains anything of value.

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:54.639
I’m gonna go put on a collared shirt because
we’re here to tackle the big picture.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:03.240
[theme music]

00:01:03.249 --> 00:01:07.840
So the silk road didn’t begin trade, but
it did radically expand its scope, and the

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:13.040
connections that were formed by mostly unknown
merchants arguably changed the world more

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.370
than any political or religious leaders.

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.640
It was especially cool If you were rich, because
you finally had something to spend your money

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:23.539
on other than temples. But even if you weren’t
rich, the Silk Road reshaped the lives of

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:27.959
everyone living in Africa and Eurasia, as we will
see today. Let’s go straight to the Thought Bubble.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.859
As previously mentioned, the silk road was
not a road. It’s not like archaeologists

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:36.009
working in Uzbekistan have uncovered a bunch
of yield signs and baby on board stickers.

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:39.460
It was an overland route where merchants carried
goods for trade.

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.280
But it was really two routes: One that connected
the Eastern Mediterranean to Central Asia

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.300
and one that went from Central Asia to China.

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:51.260
Further complicating things, the Silk Road
involved sea routes: Many goods reached Rome

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.600
via the Mediterranean,

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.390
and goods from Central Asia found their way
across the Pacific to Japan and even Java.

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.749
So we shouldn’t think of the Silk Road as
a road but rather as a network of trade routes.

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:06.079
But just as now, the goods traveled more than
the people who traded them: Very few traders

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:10.720
traversed the entire silk road: Instead, they’d
move back and forth between towns, selling

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.090
to traders who’d take the goods further
toward their destination, with everybody marking

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.860
up prices along the way.

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:22.400
So what’d they trade? Well silk, for starters.
For millennia, silk was only produced in China.

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.990
It is spun from the cocoons of mulberry tree-eating
worms and the process of silk making as well

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:33.010
as the techniques for raising the worms were
closely guarded secrets, since the lion’s

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.500
share of China’s wealth came from silk production.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.850
The Chinese used silk as fishing line, to
buy off nomadic raiders to keep things peaceful,

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:41.830
and to write before they invented paper.

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.260
But as an export, silk was mostly used for
clothes: Silk clothing feels light in the

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:51.480
summer and warm in the winter, and until we
invented $700 pre-distressed designer jeans,

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.960
decking yourself out in silk was the #1 way
to show people that you were wealthy.

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.800
Thanks, Thought Bubble. But the silk road
wasn’t all about silk.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:05.380
The Mediterranean exported such cliched goods
as olives, olive oil, wine, and mustachioed plumbers.

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.560
China also exported raw materials like
jade, silver, and iron. India exported

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.040
fine cotton textiles; the ivory that originated
in East Africa made its way across the Silk Road;

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.980
And Arabia exported incense and spices and
tortoise shells. Oh, god, it’s a red one,

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:21.390
isn’t it? It’s just gonna chase me, I
just--- Ow.

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:25.220
Up until now on Crash Course we’ve been
focused on city-dwelling civilizational types,

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.320
but with the growth of the silk road, the
nomadic people of Central Asia suddenly become

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.350
much more important to world history.

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:35.770
Most of Central Asia isn’t great for agriculture,
but it’s difficult to conquer, unless you

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:38.630
are, wait for it -- The Mongols.

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:44.960
It also lends itself fairly well to herding,
and since nomads are definitionally good at

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:50.840
moving around, they’re also good at moving stuff from
Point A to Point B, which makes them good traders.

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.480
Plus all their travel made them more resistant
to diseases.

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:57.980
One group of such nomads, the Yuezhi, were
humiliated in battle in the 2nd century BCE

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:03.560
by their bitter rivals the Xiongnu, who turned
the Yuezhi king’s skull into a drinking cup, in fact.

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.680
And in the wake of that the Yuezhi migrated
to Bactria and started the Kushan Empire in

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.660
what is now Afghanistan and Pakistan.

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:13.440
Although silk road trading began more than
a century before the birth of Jesus, it really took

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:19.320
off in the second and third centuries CE, and the Kushan
Empire became a huge hub for that silk road trade.

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:23.000
By then, nomads were being eclipsed by professional
merchants who travelled the silk roads, often

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.920
making huge profits, but those cities that had been
founded by nomadic peoples became hugely important.

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:32.240
They continued to grow, because most of the
trade on the Silk Road was by caravan, and

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:36.100
those caravans had to stop frequently, you
know, for like food and water and prostitutes.

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:40.250
These towns became fantastically wealthy:
One, Palmyra, was particularly important because

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:44.770
all of the incense and silk that travelled
to Rome had to go through Palmyra.

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:48.760
Silk was so popular among the Roman elite
that the Roman senate repeatedly tried to ban it,

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:54.460
complaining about trade imbalances caused by the
silk trade and also that silk was inadequately modest.

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:59.640
To quote Seneca the Younger, “I see clothes of silk,
if materials that do not hide the body, nor even

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.040
one's decency, can be called clothes,”

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:06.010
he also said of the woman who wears silk,
“her husband has no more acquaintance than

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:08.880
any outsider or foreigner with his wife's
body."

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.400
And yet all attempts to ban silk failed,
which speaks to how much,

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.280
even in the ancient world, wealth shaped governance.

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.320
And with trade, there was a way to become
wealthy without being a king or lord who takes

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.020
part of what your citizens produce.

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:24.580
The merchant class that grew along with the
Silk Road came to have a lot of political

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:30.080
clout, and in some ways that began the tension that we
still see today between wealth and politics. Whether

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:36.560
it’s, you know, corporations making large donations
or Vladimir Putin periodically jailing billionaires.

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:41.100
Mr. Putin, I just want to state for the record that I did
not mean that in any way, I was -- Stan wrote that joke.

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:43.260
Oh, it’s time for the Open Letter.

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.500
An Open Letter to Billionaires:

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:53.360
But first, let’s see what’s in the Secret
Compartment today. Oh, it’s some fake silk;

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.720
the stuff that put real silk out of business.

00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:00.340
Dear Billionaires, I’ve wrapped myself in the finest of
polyester so that you will take my message seriously.

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:03.610
Here at Crash Course we’ve done a lot of
research into our demographics and our show

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:07.790
is watched primarily by Grammar Nazis, Muggle
Quidditch Players, People Who Have a Test

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:09.280
Tomorrow, and Billionaires.

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:13.870
I have a message for you Billionaires: It
will never be enough. You’re relentless

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:16.320
yearning is going to kill us all.

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:17.790
Best wishes,
John Green

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:21.919
Speaking of billionaires, the goods that travelled
on the Silk Road really only changed the lives

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:27.050
of rich people. Did the Silk Road affect the
rest of us? Yes, for three reasons.

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:31.780
First, wider economic impact. Relatively few
people could afford silk, but a lot of people

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:34.100
devoted their lives to making that silk.

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:38.020
And as the market for silk grew, more and
more people chose to go into silk production

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:40.340
rather than doing something else with their
lives.

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:44.930
Second, the Silk Road didn’t just trade
luxury goods. In fact, arguably the most important

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:47.280
thing traded along the Silk Road: ideas.

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:51.220
For example, the Silk Road was the primary
route for the spread of Buddhism.When we last

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:56.020
saw the Buddha’s Eight-Fold Path to escaping
the cycle of suffering and desire that's inherent

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:59.400
to humans, it was beginning to dwindle in
India.

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:03.240
But through contacts with other cultures and
traditions, Buddhism grew and flourished and

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:06.000
became one of the great religious traditions
of the world.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.420
The variation of Buddhism that took root in
China, Korea, Japan, and Central Asia is known

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:14.169
as Mahayana Buddhism, and it differed from
the original teachings of the Buddha in many

00:07:14.169 --> 00:07:19.650
ways, but one that was fundamental. For Mahayana
Buddhists, the Buddha was divine. (I mean,

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:24.000
we can—and religious historians do—fight
over the exact definition of divine, but in

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.400
Mahayanna Buddhism, there’s no question
that the Buddha is venerated to a greater degree.

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:32.600
The idea of Nirvana also transformed from
a release from that cycle of suffering and

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:37.460
desire to something much more heavenly and
frankly more fun, and in some versions of

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:42.340
Mahayana Buddhism, there are lots of different
heavens, each more awesome than the last.

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:45.920
Rather than focusing on the fundamental fact
of suffering, Mahayana Buddhism offered the

00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:50.430
hope that through worship of the Buddha, or
one of the many bodhisattvas – holy people

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:54.870
who could have achieved nirvana but chose
to hang out on Earth with us because they’re

00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:57.730
super nice– one could attain a good afterlife.

00:07:57.730 --> 00:08:02.000
Many merchants on the silk road became strong
supporters of monasteries which in turn became

00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:04.169
convenient weigh stations for caravans.

00:08:04.169 --> 00:08:08.529
And by endowing the monasteries, rich merchants
were buying a form of supernatural insurance;

00:08:08.529 --> 00:08:11.840
Monks who lived in the monasteries would pray
for the success of trade missions and the

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:16.680
health of their patrons. It was win-win, especially
when you consider that one of the central

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:20.280
materials used in Mahayana Buddhist rituals
is … silk.

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:24.160
And a third reason the silk road changed all
our lives, worldwide interconnectedness of

00:08:24.169 --> 00:08:26.749
populations led to the spread of disease.

00:08:26.749 --> 00:08:31.260
Measles and Smallpox traveled along it, as
did bubonic plague, which came from the East

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:37.360
to the West in 534, 750, and—most devastatingly—in
1346.

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:42.119
This last plague—known as the Black Death—resulted
in the largest population decimation in human

00:08:42.119 --> 00:08:46.299
history, with nearly half of Europeans dying
in a four-year period.

00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:50.759
A sizable majority of people living in Italy
died as did two-thirds of Londoners.

00:08:50.759 --> 00:08:54.430
And it quite possibly wouldn’t have happened
without the Silk Road. If you were living

00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:58.959
in London during the fourteenth century, you
probably didn’t blame the Silk Road for

00:08:58.959 --> 00:09:01.720
your community’s devastation, but it played
a role.

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:06.459
If you look at it that way, the interconnectedness
fostered by Silk Road affected way, way more

00:09:06.459 --> 00:09:11.319
people than just those rich enough to buy
silk, just as today’s globalization offers

00:09:11.319 --> 00:09:14.259
both promise and threat to each of us.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:18.139
Next week we’ll talk about Julius Caesar
and in what situation, if any, it’s okay

00:09:18.139 --> 00:09:22.209
to stab your friend in the gut. Until then,
