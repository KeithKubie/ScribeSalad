[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:12.320
SPEAKER 1: So Jeff, Jeff
is an associate professor

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.460
of Raza Studies and Education at
San Francisco State University.

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.150
He is also the founder of Roses
in Concrete Community School,

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.500
which is a community-responsive
lab school in East Oakland.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.020
He's the founder of the
Teaching Excellence Network.

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:31.220
And in case that wasn't
enough, the community

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.800
Responsive Education Group.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.330
He's also worked with google.org
frequently over the years,

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:38.330
and several members of
that team are here today.

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.371
They were really excited
to get to see him again,

00:00:40.371 --> 00:00:42.200
which is always a good sign.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.120
As a classroom teacher
and a school leader

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.910
in East Oakland for
the past 24 years,

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.760
his pedagogy has been
widely studied and acclaimed

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.660
for producing uncommon levels
of social and academic success

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.340
for his students.

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.860
Dr. Duncan-Andrade
lectures around the world

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.440
and has authored two books
and numerous journal articles

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.830
and book chapters on effective
practices in schools.

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.010
In 2015, he was tapped to be
a commissioner on The National

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.182
Commission on Teaching &amp;
America's Future, and in 2016,

00:01:11.182 --> 00:01:13.640
was part of a group of educators
invited to the White House

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.500
on National Teacher
Appreciation Day.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.791
That's going to be a theme
amongst our keynote speakers

00:01:17.791 --> 00:01:18.890
of today.

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.230
He was invited by
President Obama.

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:22.940
Duncan-Andrade has
also been ranked

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:24.980
as one of the nation's
most influential scholars

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:26.750
and by Ed Week's Public
Influence Rankings

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.666
over the past three years.

00:01:28.666 --> 00:01:30.290
His research interests
and publications

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.470
span the areas of urban
schooling and curriculum

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.640
change, urban teacher
development and retention,

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.750
critical pedagogy, and
cultural and ethnic studies.

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.280
He works closely with
teachers, school site leaders,

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.610
union leaders, and
school district officials

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.860
to help them develop
classroom practices and school

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.820
cultures that foster
confidence, self-esteem,

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.790
and academic success
among all students.

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.630
He holds a PhD in social and
cultural studies in education

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.040
and a bachelor of arts
degree in literature,

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.800
both from UC Berkeley.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.950
So thank you so much to
Jeff, and please welcome.

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.404
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:10.404 --> 00:02:11.820
JEFF DUNCAN-ANDRADE:
Good morning.

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:13.290
AUDIENCE: Good morning.

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.900
JEFF DUNCAN-ANDRADE:
That's way better

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:14.983
than my high school class.

00:02:14.983 --> 00:02:16.260
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:25.270
So the talk that I was
asked to do today really

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:32.500
emerged probably about 18
months ago as the result of work

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.730
that I'd been doing for the
last five to seven years

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:42.610
pretty consistently, which is
I'm consistently getting called

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.890
by districts, by schools,
by charter groups,

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:53.950
by orgs like Google,
like Facebook to help

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:59.410
them think through their equity
plans or their equity efforts.

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.050
So I'm in a room
full of educators,

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.710
and I'm quite certain that
your district or school

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:10.270
group is also now
all about equity,

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:14.140
because this is all the rage
all over the country, right?

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:15.830
We're going to do equity.

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:18.580
So the first thing that
I typically say to people

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:23.800
is that if you have an equity
office or an equity officer,

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.795
then you know you
don't have equity.

00:03:25.795 --> 00:03:26.725
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:34.540
Because equity is everybody
on deck all the time.

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.480
Everybody's an equity officer,
or nobody's an equity officer.

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.331
Now you've got to
start somewhere, right?

00:03:41.331 --> 00:03:43.330
So you're probably going
to start with an equity

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.840
officer or an equity
office or an equity plan,

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.480
and this is usually the
place where I get inserted.

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:54.820
So I get asked to be a
thought partner, a consultant,

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:59.980
a co-constructor of
districts' equity plans.

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:03.920
And so I've been doing this
now for quite some time.

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:09.100
And it got to the point where
it was so common that when

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.650
I was having these
conversations and reading

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.250
these strategic plans that I
would see these two words used

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:21.279
interchangeably, that I decided
that I wanted to develop

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:24.820
a talk that helped
people disentangle

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:29.380
the concept of
equality and equity.

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:33.250
Because equality and equity
are fundamentally different,

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.560
and what I find in
a lot of schools

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.160
that are saying they're trying
to pivot towards equity,

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.440
they use these terms
interchangeably

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.750
because they haven't
actually spent the time

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:47.410
to understand what
equity means, and how

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:50.950
fundamentally different an
equitable approach to schooling

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:56.410
in this nation would be than
an equal education system.

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:59.740
Now how do we even
land on a conversation

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:01.480
about an equal education system?

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:06.129
What's the Supreme
Court decision?

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:07.170
AUDIENCE: Brown v. Board.

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:07.940
JEFF DUNCAN-ANDRADE:
OK, Brown v. Board.

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:09.220
What year is that?

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:10.140
AUDIENCE: 1956?

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:12.210
JEFF DUNCAN-ANDRADE: 1954, OK?

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:13.350
Brown v. Board.

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:15.870
Brown v. Board,
Supreme Court decision

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:21.080
legislated against another
Supreme Court decision.

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:24.730
So we had to say that
we were committed

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:27.090
to equality because why?

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:28.520
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:31.020
JEFF DUNCAN-ANDRADE: Because
we were committed to inequality

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:34.410
before, formally, right?

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:36.415
And what Supreme Court
decision was that?

00:05:36.415 --> 00:05:37.790
AUDIENCE: Plessy
versus Ferguson.

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:40.180
JEFF DUNCAN-ANDRADE:
OK Plessy v. Ferguson.

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:43.450
Plessy v. Ferguson
Supreme Court decision

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:48.700
legislated racial segregation
as the law of the land, right?

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:51.310
Plessy said-- the
Plessy decision

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:56.410
said that separate is equal.

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:58.150
That's why we have Brown.

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:02.140
So we get to 1954, and
the Brown decision says,

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:06.230
no, separate by
definition is unequal.

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:09.180
We are now in 2017.

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:13.410
So six-plus decades of
a national commitment

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:20.365
to an equal education system,
to desegregated, racially

00:06:20.365 --> 00:06:22.930
desegregated education system.

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:24.650
Six decades.

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:28.180
Highest policy body
in the land has

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:33.890
said that racial segregation
in schools is illegal.

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:37.090
Six decades plus in.

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:39.760
Any guesses on how
much progress we've

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:43.360
made on racially
desegregating city schools?

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:45.980
You just jumped right
in with the settle, OK?

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:46.772
AUDIENCE: Negative.

00:06:46.772 --> 00:06:48.021
JEFF DUNCAN-ANDRADE: Negative.

00:06:48.021 --> 00:06:49.131
You think-- what?

00:06:49.131 --> 00:06:49.630
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:51.490
AUDIENCE: I think
it's gotten worse.

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:52.860
JEFF DUNCAN-ANDRADE: You
think it's gone backwards.

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:53.980
Let's do "The Price is Right."

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:56.110
You can't actually bid negative
on "The Price is Right,"

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:56.693
so you're out.

00:06:56.693 --> 00:06:59.590
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:01.540
Anybody think we've
made any progress?

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:02.360
5%?

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:03.300
10%?

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:05.320
OK, your hand went up.

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:06.812
OK, you're in the game now.

00:07:06.812 --> 00:07:08.230
AUDIENCE: You brought
yourself in the game.

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:09.400
JEFF DUNCAN-ANDRADE: Yeah, you
brought yourself in the game.

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:10.390
OK, what do you think?

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:11.860
How much?

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:12.520
5%?

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:13.020
10%?

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:14.230
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:15.631
JEFF DUNCAN-ANDRADE: 10%.

00:07:15.631 --> 00:07:17.237
OK, anybody want to go higher?

00:07:17.237 --> 00:07:18.400
AUDIENCE: I say 20%.

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.740
JEFF DUNCAN-ANDRADE: 20%
racial desegregation.

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:21.329
AUDIENCE: 21%.

00:07:21.329 --> 00:07:22.370
JEFF DUNCAN-ANDRADE: 21%.

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:22.870
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:24.470
Yeah, now we got the game going.

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:26.350
Now we got the game going.

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:29.170
OK.

00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:29.680
No.

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:32.490
You're right.

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:33.275
Negative.

00:07:33.275 --> 00:07:34.400
No you didn't say negative.

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:35.090
You said zero.

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:35.490
AUDIENCE: I said negative.

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:36.270
JEFF DUNCAN-ANDRADE: Oh, OK.

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:36.590
All right.

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:36.920
You're right.

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:37.500
You win.

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:38.280
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:40.700
It's the new "Price is Right."

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:42.980
City schools are more
racially segregated

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:44.567
now than they were
before the Supreme

00:07:44.567 --> 00:07:45.650
Court said that's illegal.

00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:51.110
There's a man named
Gary Orfield who's

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:56.030
considered one of the nation's
leading educational historians.

00:07:56.030 --> 00:07:59.684
Lawyer by trade, he's at UCLA.

00:07:59.684 --> 00:08:01.100
He was at Harvard
for a long time.

00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:02.766
When he started this
project, he started

00:08:02.766 --> 00:08:05.520
the Harvard Civil Rights
Project, which every--

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:09.080
on every decade anniversary
of the Brown decision,

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:11.210
his research team
releases a report

00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:13.850
that tracks the
progress of our efforts

00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:15.920
to racially desegregate schools.

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:19.900
On the 60th anniversary of
Brown, he's now at UCLA.

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:23.660
So of course, the project is
now called the UCLA Civil Rights

00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:24.240
Project.

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:25.196
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:29.000
And on the 60th
anniversary of Brown,

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.040
they release their
latest report,

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:35.840
and the data reveals that
schools are now more racially

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:37.159
segregated.

00:08:37.159 --> 00:08:39.380
We've gone backwards.

00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:43.720
That, y'all, is the
value of a policy.

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:47.020
We cannot policy
our way out of this.

00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:49.630
Now that doesn't mean
policy doesn't matter.

00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:51.190
Y'all are educators.

00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:53.120
I'm a 25-year vet
of the classroom.

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:55.100
I know policy matters.

00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:56.590
I know my life
was very different

00:08:56.590 --> 00:08:59.800
when we had No Child Left
Behind than it was before we

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:01.354
had No Child Left Behind.

00:09:01.354 --> 00:09:03.520
There's always been a bunch
of children left behind.

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:04.996
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:13.160
So the pivot from
an equal education

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:16.820
system, which we have
failed miserably at--

00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:18.680
and everyone in this
room knows because it's

00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:21.440
the worst-kept secret
in the country.

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:26.630
Everyone in this room knows that
wealthy children, middle class

00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:29.720
children that attend
public schools

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:32.360
attend public schools
that are fundamentally

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:36.820
different than the schools
that poor children attend,

00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:38.780
the children of color attend.

00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:41.340
Everyone knows that.

00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:46.580
And equality, an equal education
system is like "Sesame Street"

00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:47.670
shit.

00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:50.670
One for you, one for me,
one for you, one for me.

00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:53.430
And we haven't even
pulled that off.

00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:57.791
And now we're talking
about pivoting to equity.

00:09:57.791 --> 00:10:02.100
And equity's a much different,
much more complex lift.

00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:05.460
So if you go move
to equity, you've

00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:08.780
got to first really
invest in understanding

00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:12.110
the difference between
an equal education system

00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:16.820
and what it's produced for
us and an equitable education

00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:21.140
system and what its potential
is to produce for us.

00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:24.050
Now the way I've come
to understand this,

00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:28.792
and probably at the deepest
level of my understanding

00:10:28.792 --> 00:10:36.970
is because I have
a live experiment

00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:40.360
in my home about the difference
between equality and equity,

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:43.200
because I have twin boys.

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:46.420
These are my sons,
Amaru and Taiyari.

00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:48.900
And I shit you not,
I'm not making this up.

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:50.820
I dare you to even
try to make this up.

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:53.485
Last night, I'm on the
phone because I'm--

00:10:53.485 --> 00:10:55.110
if you look at my
car right now, you're

00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:57.630
going to see a suitcase,
because I flew in last night

00:10:57.630 --> 00:10:59.410
and then yeah.

00:10:59.410 --> 00:10:59.910
All that.

00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:00.409
OK.

00:11:00.409 --> 00:11:06.180
So I'm on the phone with
my son on my travels home

00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:07.290
and he says--

00:11:07.290 --> 00:11:09.680
he's about to go to bed.

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:12.270
And I said, what
are you doing, son?

00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:19.950
And he said, I'm asking Google
if Han Solo and the Millennium

00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:24.630
Falcon and Stormtroopers
and Princess Leia

00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:25.710
can all be friends.

00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:27.470
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:29.760
And I said, you're asking who?

00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:32.460
And he said-- then
he quotes Bush.

00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:34.080
He says, "the Google."

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:37.960
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:40.640
And I said, son, I'm
probably not going

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:43.020
to be there in the
morning when you wake up.

00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:44.190
And he says, why not?

00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:46.080
And I said, because I'm
going to the Google.

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:48.480
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:51.360
[APPLAUSE]

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:54.090
And he's so juiced.

00:11:54.090 --> 00:11:56.490
And then I get out the
house this morning--

00:11:56.490 --> 00:11:59.160
and this is partially
the reason why I'm late--

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:02.642
and I forgot my belt.
And I get down the block,

00:12:02.642 --> 00:12:03.600
and I'm like, oh, shit.

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:06.024
I forgot my belt and my
pants are falling down.

00:12:06.024 --> 00:12:08.190
I can't be at the Google
with my pants falling down.

00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:09.220
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:14.240
So I go back to the house to get
my belt, and my sons are there.

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:16.160
And my son runs up to me.

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:17.340
He's like, Daddy, it's--

00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:20.750
I have-- he's like, did
you go to the Google?

00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:21.680
And I said, no, son.

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:22.200
I'm going.

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:24.840
And he says, Daddy, take
a picture with the Google.

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:25.820
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:26.699
OK, so y'all have--

00:12:26.699 --> 00:12:28.490
Googlers, you've got
to help me figure out,

00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:30.010
like, what does
that actually mean?

00:12:30.010 --> 00:12:30.510
How do you--

00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:31.620
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:34.670
He thinks the Google
is a person, OK?

00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:36.990
So I need a person.

00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:39.540
Otherwise, my son's going
to be really confused, OK?

00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:42.120
So this is my life, OK?

00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:46.010
This is my experiment
around the difference

00:12:46.010 --> 00:12:48.390
between equality and equity.

00:12:48.390 --> 00:12:53.140
Now the boy that I'm
talking about is Amaru, OK?

00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:55.390
And Amaru is constantly
thirsty, so much

00:12:55.390 --> 00:12:59.290
so that this dude literally
will drop a straw into anything

00:12:59.290 --> 00:13:01.120
to try to extract liquid, OK?

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:03.790
In this particular
case, he struck gold.

00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:05.500
That's a coconut
he's got a straw in.

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:10.800
And Taiyari is constantly
hungry, so much

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:13.557
so that this dude will
literally store morsels of food

00:13:13.557 --> 00:13:14.890
on his shirt for later snacking.

00:13:14.890 --> 00:13:18.229
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:23.850
This is a picture of our family,
first time out the house.

00:13:23.850 --> 00:13:26.970
Literally, first time out the
house after the boys were born.

00:13:26.970 --> 00:13:28.702
Anybody here have multiples?

00:13:28.702 --> 00:13:30.660
OK, so you know exactly
what I'm talking about.

00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:31.570
That's real talk, isn't it?

00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:34.185
That's literally the first time
we made it out of the house.

00:13:34.185 --> 00:13:36.310
Everybody else is like,
oh, come on-- no, for real.

00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:38.150
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:42.230
So anybody here from Oakland?

00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:42.740
OK.

00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:45.470
So y'all would know that
this is the lake, right?

00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:47.840
This is Lake Merritt.

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:49.760
Gathering place for
folks from the community.

00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:54.390
So we're out at the lake, and
community members walking by.

00:13:54.390 --> 00:13:55.070
Hey, hey, hey.

00:13:55.070 --> 00:13:56.510
Can you take a
picture of the family?

00:13:56.510 --> 00:13:57.510
It's our first time out.

00:13:57.510 --> 00:13:59.556
Can you take-- so
he snaps this photo

00:13:59.556 --> 00:14:00.680
and hands me my phone back.

00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:02.680
And I'm looking at the
phone, put the boys down.

00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:06.530
Looking at the phone, and I'm
like, what the hell is that?

00:14:06.530 --> 00:14:08.180
I said, Taiyari, come here, boy.

00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:09.050
Come here.

00:14:09.050 --> 00:14:11.110
I call him over.

00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:14.600
And that is bark from that tree.

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:19.300
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:23.800
So when I tell you that my
son is constantly hungry,

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:26.770
we're literally talking
about a young brother

00:14:26.770 --> 00:14:30.010
that will pull bark off
of trees and eat it.

00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:30.770
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:30.770 --> 00:14:31.270
OK?

00:14:31.270 --> 00:14:35.760
So in this context,
is this equal?

00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:37.090
AUDIENCE: No.

00:14:37.090 --> 00:14:38.090
JEFF DUNCAN-ANDRADE: OK.

00:14:38.090 --> 00:14:42.200
So you went right to no, OK?

00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:44.582
So why do you say no?

00:14:44.582 --> 00:14:46.290
AUDIENCE: They're
getting the same thing,

00:14:46.290 --> 00:14:48.150
but they're not really
getting-- they're not getting--

00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:49.010
JEFF DUNCAN-ANDRADE: Whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:14:49.010 --> 00:14:50.011
Is this equal?

00:14:50.011 --> 00:14:50.594
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:14:50.594 --> 00:14:50.998
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:14:50.998 --> 00:14:52.210
They're getting the same thing.

00:14:52.210 --> 00:14:53.430
JEFF DUNCAN-ANDRADE: Oh, now
you want to change your answer?

00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:55.114
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:57.970
Just make sure you let
kids do the same thing.

00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:02.700
So anybody here say
this is not equal?

00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:06.570
OK, in the back.

00:15:06.570 --> 00:15:08.347
Why do you say
this is not equal?

00:15:08.347 --> 00:15:10.055
AUDIENCE: They're
getting the same thing,

00:15:10.055 --> 00:15:13.464
but they're not taking
in the same thing.

00:15:13.464 --> 00:15:15.655
Your son that drinks will
drink the whole thing,

00:15:15.655 --> 00:15:18.334
and your son that eats a
lot will eat the bottle.

00:15:18.334 --> 00:15:22.464
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:22.464 --> 00:15:24.380
JEFF DUNCAN-ANDRADE: So
why is that not equal?

00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:30.130
See, your problem
and your problem,

00:15:30.130 --> 00:15:32.210
and all those that you
went straight to no,

00:15:32.210 --> 00:15:35.840
your problem is that you
ignored the question.

00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:38.840
In point of fact, you
actually changed the question.

00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:45.770
You changed the question from,
is this equal to is this fair?

00:15:45.770 --> 00:15:47.630
But that's not what I asked you.

00:15:47.630 --> 00:15:49.910
I asked you, is this equal?

00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:53.770
And this is the dictionary
definition of equal.

00:15:53.770 --> 00:15:56.140
It is in every way equal.

00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:58.930
It is also unfair.

00:15:58.930 --> 00:16:01.890
And there is nothing in
the definition of equality

00:16:01.890 --> 00:16:02.975
that talks about fairness.

00:16:05.810 --> 00:16:08.360
And that's why the pursuit
of an equal education

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:12.050
system in a pluralistic,
multiracial democracy that

00:16:12.050 --> 00:16:16.190
is also embedded with a long
history of white supremacy

00:16:16.190 --> 00:16:20.570
and male supremacy and hetero
supremacy and class supremacy

00:16:20.570 --> 00:16:26.660
and radicalized inequality has
created a fundamentally unequal

00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:29.330
society, such that
it's literally

00:16:29.330 --> 00:16:34.780
disruptive of a pluralistic,
multiracial democracy.

00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:39.500
Equity is the right pivot,
but to pivot towards equity,

00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:41.640
you have to
understand two things.

00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:44.450
One, it's not a soft pivot.

00:16:44.450 --> 00:16:46.550
It's a hard pivot.

00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:50.870
It's going to mean hard,
complicated, difficult changes

00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:54.830
for you as a practitioner
and for the systems

00:16:54.830 --> 00:16:56.960
that we work in.

00:16:56.960 --> 00:17:03.200
And part of the reason that that
hard pivot is required of us

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:07.400
is because of the data that six
decades of an equal education

00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:08.760
system have produced.

00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:10.599
Y'all work in
data-driven systems?

00:17:10.599 --> 00:17:11.944
Y'all data-driven?

00:17:11.944 --> 00:17:14.910
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:14.910 --> 00:17:19.440
I think it's fantastic
that we're data-driven.

00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:22.420
We should be data-driven.

00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:32.140
But I got here today using my
Waze app, my nav app, right?

00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:35.732
So I'm from the 3400
block in East Oakland.

00:17:35.732 --> 00:17:41.090
So from 3416 David Street,
I had to put in 111--

00:17:41.090 --> 00:17:41.930
AUDIENCE: Java.

00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:43.013
JEFF DUNCAN-ANDRADE: Java.

00:17:43.013 --> 00:17:43.892
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:45.374 --> 00:17:49.400
That's power when you
can, like, name streets.

00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:50.550
111 Java.

00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:55.150
And I put that in
there, and then Waze

00:17:55.150 --> 00:17:58.420
told me where I needed to go.

00:17:58.420 --> 00:18:05.880
So what would have happened if
I had put in the wrong address?

00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:07.630
Y'all would still be
on your Chromebooks.

00:18:07.630 --> 00:18:09.594
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:14.254
But I'd still have
been data-driven.

00:18:14.254 --> 00:18:16.600
Huh.

00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:19.270
Because I still would
have put data in.

00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:21.610
It's not about
being data-driven.

00:18:21.610 --> 00:18:24.330
It's about being driven
by the right data.

00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:26.890
And if you're ending
up in the wrong place

00:18:26.890 --> 00:18:29.980
year after year after year
with the same group of kids,

00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:32.240
what does that mean?

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:34.870
It means you're looking
at the wrong data.

00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:38.230
If you keep looking at the same
data year after year after year

00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:41.230
because you're data-driven, and
you keep ending up in the wrong

00:18:41.230 --> 00:18:45.310
location, and then you
blame the nav system--

00:18:45.310 --> 00:18:48.100
you're pissed at Waze because
it took you to the wrong place

00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:50.940
when in fact, you told
Waze where to take you.

00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:54.820
If your school is missing
the mark consistently

00:18:54.820 --> 00:18:57.490
with the same group of
kids, change the data

00:18:57.490 --> 00:18:58.540
you're looking at.

00:18:58.540 --> 00:19:03.940
Now here's some data
for us on six decades

00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:05.980
of a commitment to
an equal education

00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:08.260
system, question mark.

00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:09.490
Because it isn't even equal.

00:19:09.490 --> 00:19:13.610
It's largely unequal or inequal.

00:19:13.610 --> 00:19:16.810
But we have lots
of national data

00:19:16.810 --> 00:19:21.220
on the impact of this
commitment to public education

00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:22.800
in this country.

00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:26.290
And I'll start with this one,
high school graduation rates.

00:19:26.290 --> 00:19:29.690
Not long before Arne
Duncan was leaving office,

00:19:29.690 --> 00:19:36.220
he was all over CNN,
MSNBC, CBS, ABC,

00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:39.850
lauding himself and the
Obama administration

00:19:39.850 --> 00:19:42.370
for having created the
highest high school graduation

00:19:42.370 --> 00:19:45.697
rate in the history
of the United States.

00:19:45.697 --> 00:19:47.530
And at that time, I was
teaching high school

00:19:47.530 --> 00:19:49.680
at Fremont High
School, deep East

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:52.550
Oakland, arguably
one of the 10 worst

00:19:52.550 --> 00:19:54.440
high schools in the nation.

00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:57.590
It's also my
neighborhood high school.

00:19:57.590 --> 00:19:59.600
Now I'm teaching English.

00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:02.180
And I'm listening to Arne
Duncan, the top elected

00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:07.400
official, appointed
official in our field

00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:11.540
tell me that it's better
than it's ever been.

00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:13.500
And I'm at Fremont
where it's worse

00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:17.610
than it's ever been
in my 20 years there.

00:20:17.610 --> 00:20:23.980
And I'm, like, having all kinds
of intellectual disconnect.

00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:26.330
But you see, the
problem with me is

00:20:26.330 --> 00:20:29.880
that I've been trained
in the same institutions

00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:33.010
as Arne was trained
in, and so I don't

00:20:33.010 --> 00:20:38.050
get fooled by presentations of
data, because this isn't data.

00:20:38.050 --> 00:20:41.170
This is a presentation of data.

00:20:41.170 --> 00:20:45.070
And so we went and got the data.

00:20:45.070 --> 00:20:48.820
And this isn't actually the
map that Arne presented.

00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:53.650
This is a re-rendition of the
map with one control group.

00:20:53.650 --> 00:20:57.820
All we did was control
for one factor.

00:20:57.820 --> 00:20:59.900
Income.

00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:02.760
So we split the map
and we said, OK.

00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:06.130
What are the high school
graduation patterns

00:21:06.130 --> 00:21:08.840
for kids that don't
live in poverty?

00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:14.490
So this is actually for
non-low income students.

00:21:14.490 --> 00:21:16.240
That's the high school
graduation pattern.

00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:18.940
Does this shock anybody?

00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:22.390
Probably not, because public
schools in this country

00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:25.090
have pretty consistently
and effectively

00:21:25.090 --> 00:21:28.510
served the needs of middle
and upper income kids.

00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:37.080
That's the graduation map
for kids living in poverty.

00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:38.920
Didn't control for race.

00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:40.900
We could do this map
for race and it'd

00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:44.320
look pretty much like this
for black and brown kids.

00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:47.180
But we just
controlled for income.

00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:49.610
And I know what
y'all are thinking.

00:21:49.610 --> 00:21:50.210
Texas?

00:21:50.210 --> 00:21:53.465
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:53.465 --> 00:21:54.730
Anybody here in Texas?

00:21:54.730 --> 00:21:55.950
[CHEERING]

00:21:55.950 --> 00:21:56.450
Uh-oh.

00:21:56.450 --> 00:21:56.950
I'd better--

00:21:56.950 --> 00:21:59.420
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:59.420 --> 00:22:01.230
I'd better kill
all my Texas jokes.

00:22:01.230 --> 00:22:02.940
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:05.010
Normally in California
those go over really well.

00:22:05.010 --> 00:22:06.636
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:06.636 --> 00:22:08.280
I'm in mixed company right now.

00:22:10.890 --> 00:22:12.245
Texas cheats.

00:22:12.245 --> 00:22:13.660
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:16.110
Y'all got caught.

00:22:16.110 --> 00:22:18.610
Send them to the White House,
send them right back to Texas.

00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:21.800
Kentucky.

00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:22.925
Anybody here from Kentucky?

00:22:22.925 --> 00:22:24.480
We'll bang on Kentucky then.

00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:25.271
We'll leave Texas--

00:22:25.271 --> 00:22:27.070
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:27.070 --> 00:22:29.510
This is still a
display of data, OK?

00:22:29.510 --> 00:22:31.580
It still deserves to
be interrogated, right?

00:22:31.580 --> 00:22:34.440
Is Texas actually doing
better with poor kids?

00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:36.512
Or are they manipulating
their data, right?

00:22:36.512 --> 00:22:38.720
And the Texas educators
themselves are like, hell no,

00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:40.386
we ain't doing no
better with poor kids.

00:22:40.386 --> 00:22:42.830
And of course, we know this.

00:22:42.830 --> 00:22:49.060
But if this is not a national
crisis, pray tell, what is?

00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:53.400
The group of children
around the nation that most

00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:56.220
need public schools
to serve them

00:22:56.220 --> 00:23:01.140
well are being failed
across the board, Texas

00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:02.130
and Kentucky excluded.

00:23:02.130 --> 00:23:03.810
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:04.650 --> 00:23:08.550
That's a national crisis
if we are actually

00:23:08.550 --> 00:23:12.090
aiming to be a pluralistic,
multiracial democracy.

00:23:12.090 --> 00:23:16.270
Because this is the map
of a social apartheid.

00:23:16.270 --> 00:23:18.820
This is radicalized
inequality that

00:23:18.820 --> 00:23:22.360
is so embedded across
the nation that it's

00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:27.010
interruptive of a pluralistic,
multiracial democracy.

00:23:27.010 --> 00:23:30.470
This is our national
income data.

00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:32.390
This is not from some
progressive think tank.

00:23:32.390 --> 00:23:37.250
This is actually Congressional
Budget Office data.

00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:44.140
The United States is
the most unequal society

00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:50.230
not in the world, in the history
of the industrialized world.

00:23:50.230 --> 00:23:56.570
We are the historical global
champs at income inequality.

00:23:56.570 --> 00:24:00.730
This is the corresponding
map for incarceration.

00:24:00.730 --> 00:24:04.650
We are not only the global
champs at income inequality,

00:24:04.650 --> 00:24:09.780
we're also the global champs
at locking up our own citizens.

00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:13.230
No country in the
world locks up more

00:24:13.230 --> 00:24:16.950
of its own citizens per
capita than the United States.

00:24:16.950 --> 00:24:21.000
In point of fact,
no one's even close.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:21.874
Not raw in.

00:24:21.874 --> 00:24:23.290
I'm not talking
about raw numbers.

00:24:23.290 --> 00:24:28.810
I'm talking about per capita, we
lock up more than anybody else.

00:24:28.810 --> 00:24:31.920
The second closest
nation state is Russia,

00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:33.750
and they're not
even close to us.

00:24:33.750 --> 00:24:35.520
There's a great
website called Debt

00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:39.270
to Society that's run
by "Mother Jones" that

00:24:39.270 --> 00:24:44.310
tracks incarceration
expenditures, investments,

00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:46.110
and patterns all over the world.

00:24:48.650 --> 00:24:52.430
It's a good point of
entry into discussions

00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:54.890
about where we're investing
and where we're not

00:24:54.890 --> 00:24:57.530
investing in this country,
and what the rest of the world

00:24:57.530 --> 00:24:59.360
looks like.

00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:02.376
This is the Global Peace Index.

00:25:02.376 --> 00:25:04.530
The Global Peace
Index, like any index,

00:25:04.530 --> 00:25:06.930
is worthy of critique
and analysis.

00:25:06.930 --> 00:25:08.460
Certainly some things missing.

00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:13.350
But just by way of
kind of like truthing

00:25:13.350 --> 00:25:16.860
how legit is this index,
the Global Peace Index

00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:21.630
is used as the primary index of
peace, justice, and stability

00:25:21.630 --> 00:25:27.030
by the UN, by UNESCO, and by the
World Health Organization, OK?

00:25:27.030 --> 00:25:29.010
Those are about
as big as you get

00:25:29.010 --> 00:25:33.360
in terms of global organizations
that are attentive to peace

00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:35.110
in the world.

00:25:35.110 --> 00:25:38.430
And every time I put
this up, the same thing

00:25:38.430 --> 00:25:40.470
that's happening
right now happens,

00:25:40.470 --> 00:25:42.330
which is everybody
stops looking at me

00:25:42.330 --> 00:25:44.340
and they start
looking for the US

00:25:44.340 --> 00:25:48.870
in the rankings, because the
US is obsessed with rankings.

00:25:48.870 --> 00:25:53.310
And you're not finding it,
because we're not there.

00:25:53.310 --> 00:25:56.240
We didn't make the top 15.

00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:57.872
We're 94.

00:25:57.872 --> 00:25:59.460
AUDIENCE: Holy moly.

00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:00.960
JEFF DUNCAN-ANDRADE:
This is perhaps

00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:08.900
the most indicting data of
our public education system

00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:10.940
that I've seen.

00:26:10.940 --> 00:26:14.780
Because we have every child in
this country for eight hours

00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:17.810
a day for 13
consecutive years in

00:26:17.810 --> 00:26:22.140
their key developmental years.

00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:25.500
Research is clear about the
fact that during those years

00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:29.190
that schools have a bigger
influence and more time

00:26:29.190 --> 00:26:32.500
with children than
their families.

00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:38.410
And yet we have produced one of
the most unpeaceful societies

00:26:38.410 --> 00:26:43.070
in the world, despite
all that investment.

00:26:43.070 --> 00:26:46.070
The 2016 Index came
out not long ago,

00:26:46.070 --> 00:26:47.450
and we're trending
the wrong way.

00:26:47.450 --> 00:26:49.910
We're now 103.

00:26:49.910 --> 00:26:53.150
And what I find particularly
interesting about our ranking

00:26:53.150 --> 00:26:56.250
is who's ahead of us.

00:26:56.250 --> 00:26:57.840
Nation states that
we are regularly

00:26:57.840 --> 00:27:02.700
on public record for
critiquing their total state

00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:08.040
of discontinuity, disarray,
injustice, and lack of peace.

00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:10.710
And yet according to
the Peace Index that

00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:15.330
is used by the globe's
largest and most

00:27:15.330 --> 00:27:19.680
committed organizations to
studying and promoting peace,

00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:21.800
we are doing worse than them.

00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:26.850
Now I would venture a guess that
few, if any people in this room

00:27:26.850 --> 00:27:30.250
live at 103.

00:27:30.250 --> 00:27:33.100
In point of fact, most
of us in this room

00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:36.150
live somewhere
around the top 20.

00:27:36.150 --> 00:27:40.950
Which means what if we're 103?

00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:43.250
What does it mean for the
kids that are struggling

00:27:43.250 --> 00:27:44.390
the most in your school?

00:27:44.390 --> 00:27:45.660
Where do they live?

00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:46.580
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:46.580 --> 00:27:49.330
JEFF DUNCAN-ANDRADE:
Yeah, they live at 140.

00:27:49.330 --> 00:27:52.580
Because for us to get to
103 in the aggregate when

00:27:52.580 --> 00:27:55.580
all these people in
this room live at 20

00:27:55.580 --> 00:28:00.650
means that somebody else is
way below 103 to get us to 103.

00:28:00.650 --> 00:28:06.140
And that disconnect is what
Bryan Stevenson calls proximity

00:28:06.140 --> 00:28:09.590
to pain or a lack of
proximity to pain.

00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:14.030
Bryan Stevenson, another
person that Google's made

00:28:14.030 --> 00:28:17.300
a lot of investment in.

00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:21.120
Consider the nation's
leading death row lawyer.

00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:22.830
For my money, has
the best analysis

00:28:22.830 --> 00:28:26.100
of race going in the country.

00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:29.596
Says that the problem that we
have in this society right now

00:28:29.596 --> 00:28:31.470
is that most of the
people that are designing

00:28:31.470 --> 00:28:34.500
the solutions for pain
aren't proximate to the pain

00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:36.210
that they're trying to relieve.

00:28:36.210 --> 00:28:38.130
And when you're not
proximate to the pain,

00:28:38.130 --> 00:28:41.010
you come up with solutions that
are most convenient for you

00:28:41.010 --> 00:28:42.570
not in pain.

00:28:42.570 --> 00:28:45.450
But when you get
proximate to the pain,

00:28:45.450 --> 00:28:50.770
the solutions you come up
with are very, very different.

00:28:50.770 --> 00:28:52.800
But most of us are
serving children

00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:57.930
that are living somewhere around
130 or 140 while we live in 20.

00:28:57.930 --> 00:29:03.810
And that disconnect leads us to
create schools that disconnect

00:29:03.810 --> 00:29:05.520
the kids that most need it.

00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:08.550
How do we get
proximate to the pain

00:29:08.550 --> 00:29:11.940
that we're actually trying to
relieve in our service of youth

00:29:11.940 --> 00:29:13.580
and families?

00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:16.200
1854.

00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:20.430
London, England was on
the verge of collapse.

00:29:20.430 --> 00:29:24.590
Massive outbreak of
cholera, so much so

00:29:24.590 --> 00:29:29.720
that city officials believed
that they would lose the city.

00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:32.680
In a last ditch
effort to save London,

00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:36.750
they sequestered the leading
medical officials in the city,

00:29:36.750 --> 00:29:41.350
locked them in a room, sat
them at a table and said,

00:29:41.350 --> 00:29:43.840
you're not coming out
of here until you've

00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:48.160
got the solution for
cholera for this city.

00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:51.060
They sat in there and knocked
around ideas, strategized,

00:29:51.060 --> 00:29:54.352
whiteboarded it.

00:29:54.352 --> 00:29:56.810
One of the doctors sitting at
the table stands up and says,

00:29:56.810 --> 00:29:58.035
this is absurd.

00:29:58.035 --> 00:30:00.500
They said, what do you mean?

00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:02.850
He says, every single
solution we come up

00:30:02.850 --> 00:30:06.960
with defaults us to cholera.

00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:08.460
We're coming up
with ways that we're

00:30:08.460 --> 00:30:11.290
going to live with cholera.

00:30:11.290 --> 00:30:14.500
How we're going to
manage our suffering.

00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:17.065
They said, yeah.

00:30:17.065 --> 00:30:19.780
He says, I didn't sign
up to be a medical doctor

00:30:19.780 --> 00:30:22.150
to live in a state of sickness.

00:30:22.150 --> 00:30:24.580
I signed up to be
medical doctor to create

00:30:24.580 --> 00:30:26.410
the conditions of wellness.

00:30:26.410 --> 00:30:29.110
And I'm OK with
treating sickness,

00:30:29.110 --> 00:30:30.550
but that's not the end game.

00:30:30.550 --> 00:30:33.640
The end game is total wellness.

00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:36.050
They said, well, you're
not being realistic.

00:30:36.050 --> 00:30:38.220
You're not looking at the data.

00:30:38.220 --> 00:30:42.190
And I hear this said to school
leaders and classroom teachers

00:30:42.190 --> 00:30:46.690
all the time when we start
talking about a radical pivot,

00:30:46.690 --> 00:30:49.810
fundamentally
changing what we do

00:30:49.810 --> 00:30:51.609
on the day-to-day
in schools, how

00:30:51.609 --> 00:30:53.650
we interact with the
children that we continually

00:30:53.650 --> 00:30:55.120
fail to serve.

00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:57.680
Hard pivots.

00:30:57.680 --> 00:31:01.972
I hear them told that
they're not being pragmatic,

00:31:01.972 --> 00:31:05.470
that they're not
looking at the data,

00:31:05.470 --> 00:31:08.070
just like they told
this medical doctor.

00:31:08.070 --> 00:31:10.071
So he looks back
at his colleagues

00:31:10.071 --> 00:31:11.570
and he says, if
that's what it needs

00:31:11.570 --> 00:31:14.400
be part of your
medical association,

00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:17.080
I don't want to be part of
your medical association.

00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:18.590
And they said, cool.

00:31:18.590 --> 00:31:20.640
Showed him the door.

00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:24.550
That medical doctor's
name was John Snow.

00:31:24.550 --> 00:31:26.090
No, not that John Snow.

00:31:26.090 --> 00:31:28.395
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:30.430 --> 00:31:33.110
That John Snow.

00:31:33.110 --> 00:31:37.820
John Snow hits the
streets and becomes

00:31:37.820 --> 00:31:42.320
an ethnographer of the
community he aims to serve.

00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:44.630
Study after study for
the last four decades

00:31:44.630 --> 00:31:48.620
suggests that the most
successful educators in service

00:31:48.620 --> 00:31:50.660
of the nation's most
vulnerable youth

00:31:50.660 --> 00:31:53.840
are first and
foremost ethnographers

00:31:53.840 --> 00:31:56.150
of the communities
that they serve.

00:31:56.150 --> 00:32:00.290
They are on the streets
when the sun go down.

00:32:00.290 --> 00:32:02.920
They're on the streets
on the weekends.

00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:04.240
They're in the homes.

00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:08.330
They're in the lives of the
people they aim to serve.

00:32:08.330 --> 00:32:13.530
And they're students of those
families in those communities.

00:32:13.530 --> 00:32:17.340
They're researchers,
just like John Snow.

00:32:17.340 --> 00:32:21.880
John Snow said, we don't
have the right data.

00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:25.270
I've got to get better data.

00:32:25.270 --> 00:32:26.990
So he starts
interviewing everybody

00:32:26.990 --> 00:32:31.200
that he can that had cholera,
and everybody that he could

00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:33.910
that didn't have cholera,
and he collects data.

00:32:33.910 --> 00:32:38.550
And what John Snow found in his
data is a researcher's dream.

00:32:38.550 --> 00:32:40.920
He found a perfect binary.

00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:43.450
He found causal.

00:32:43.450 --> 00:32:46.570
What John Snow found is
that every single person

00:32:46.570 --> 00:32:50.810
in London that had cholera
drank from that water fountain.

00:32:50.810 --> 00:32:54.810
And every single person
that didn't, didn't.

00:32:54.810 --> 00:32:59.202
So John Snow got a saw,
and he cut off the handle,

00:32:59.202 --> 00:33:02.480
and cholera stopped.

00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:05.250
London saved.

00:33:05.250 --> 00:33:11.370
Cut off the handle of an
equal education system.

00:33:11.370 --> 00:33:14.430
That pump is poison.

00:33:14.430 --> 00:33:21.000
It has created one of the most
radically unequal democracies

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:23.820
that we've ever seen.

00:33:23.820 --> 00:33:26.110
Pivot to equity.

00:33:26.110 --> 00:33:30.360
The equity conversation
means that if you're hungry,

00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:32.390
you get food.

00:33:32.390 --> 00:33:35.245
If you're thirsty,
you get water.

00:33:35.245 --> 00:33:37.120
If you're hella thirsty,
you get hella water.

00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:40.660
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:40.660 --> 00:33:48.130
In an equity paradigm, you get
what you need when you need it.

00:33:48.130 --> 00:33:55.330
This is the big commitment
for the pivot to equity.

00:33:55.330 --> 00:33:57.781
The mistake in Brown, 1954--

00:33:57.781 --> 00:33:59.530
a lot of folks don't
know there's actually

00:33:59.530 --> 00:34:00.580
two Brown decisions.

00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:02.740
There's Brown v. Board (1)
and Brown v. Board (2).

00:34:02.740 --> 00:34:06.990
Why did we have to
re-legislate the legislation?

00:34:06.990 --> 00:34:09.190
Why did we need a
second Brown decision?

00:34:09.190 --> 00:34:14.150
Why did the court revisit
its first decision?

00:34:14.150 --> 00:34:16.400
Because we weren't
making any progress.

00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:20.130
They said, what the
hell's going on?

00:34:20.130 --> 00:34:22.679
We legislated racial
desegregation.

00:34:22.679 --> 00:34:23.610
It's not happening.

00:34:23.610 --> 00:34:24.690
What is going on?

00:34:24.690 --> 00:34:27.687
And they went back and they
looked at their decision.

00:34:27.687 --> 00:34:29.520
And what they found is
that in the decision,

00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:34.130
they didn't say when.

00:34:34.130 --> 00:34:37.230
They just said, we will do this.

00:34:37.230 --> 00:34:40.770
So Brown v. Board (2) produces
perhaps the most famous line

00:34:40.770 --> 00:34:42.389
in the Brown decision.

00:34:42.389 --> 00:34:45.170
"With all deliberate speed."

00:34:45.170 --> 00:34:45.670
When?

00:34:45.670 --> 00:34:47.139
"With all deliberate speed."

00:34:47.139 --> 00:34:51.310
Well, apparently, that
means backwards first.

00:34:51.310 --> 00:34:53.500
If you're going
to do equity, make

00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:57.620
sure you say when
you're going to do it.

00:34:57.620 --> 00:35:02.320
By when will that group of kids
have a different experience

00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:05.980
in your classroom, in your
school, in your programs,

00:35:05.980 --> 00:35:06.790
in your community?

00:35:06.790 --> 00:35:10.090
Because if you don't say
when, then you'll just wring

00:35:10.090 --> 00:35:12.640
your hands when you don't.

00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:14.980
Because you're not on
the hook for anything.

00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:17.440
You'll talk about how
hard you're trying.

00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:19.030
We tried this, we tried that.

00:35:19.030 --> 00:35:20.920
We hired this person,
we hired that person.

00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:22.850
No results.

00:35:22.850 --> 00:35:26.590
Very same thing we find
intolerable with our children.

00:35:26.590 --> 00:35:28.150
You must produce results.

00:35:28.150 --> 00:35:31.780
We model that for them
as adults in schools.

00:35:31.780 --> 00:35:34.499
We hand-wring.

00:35:34.499 --> 00:35:36.040
But you put yourself
on the hook when

00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:37.915
you say when you're
going to do these things.

00:35:37.915 --> 00:35:39.640
By this date, we
will have this done.

00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:42.850
By this date, this data
will look this way.

00:35:42.850 --> 00:35:44.830
And you may miss the mark.

00:35:44.830 --> 00:35:48.200
But now it's power
that's on the hook.

00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:50.830
It's power that's accountable.

00:35:50.830 --> 00:35:56.020
And it's power that's often the
least accountable for change.

00:35:56.020 --> 00:35:57.460
So put yourselves on the hook.

00:35:57.460 --> 00:36:00.160
Then you earn the
right to really push

00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:04.290
children and families
to come along with us.

00:36:04.290 --> 00:36:08.190
Now this is not anything
particularly new.

00:36:10.770 --> 00:36:16.150
Maslow, 1943.

00:36:16.150 --> 00:36:18.850
1943.

00:36:18.850 --> 00:36:22.950
Of all the schools
that are in this room,

00:36:22.950 --> 00:36:27.750
I would stake my career on
this statement, that there

00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:33.260
is nothing being used in your
schools that has the research

00:36:33.260 --> 00:36:35.510
base of Maslow.

00:36:35.510 --> 00:36:40.430
Seven-plus decades
cross-disciplinary.

00:36:40.430 --> 00:36:44.060
Public health, social
epidemiology, neuroscience,

00:36:44.060 --> 00:36:49.540
the medical field, child
development, psychology all

00:36:49.540 --> 00:36:50.370
agree.

00:36:50.370 --> 00:36:51.250
Yep.

00:36:51.250 --> 00:36:52.176
He's right.

00:36:55.420 --> 00:36:59.770
So if your school is both
data-driven and research-based,

00:36:59.770 --> 00:37:01.350
start with Maslow.

00:37:01.350 --> 00:37:03.490
Every time you get
stuck with a kid,

00:37:03.490 --> 00:37:07.120
every time you get stuck with
a family, start with Maslow.

00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:08.500
Start at the base.

00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:12.010
Food, clothing, shelter,
safety, basic needs.

00:37:12.010 --> 00:37:16.330
We know from all of those
fields that if a kid shows up

00:37:16.330 --> 00:37:18.600
hungry, what can't they do?

00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:19.480
AUDIENCE: Learn.

00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:20.479
JEFF DUNCAN-ANDRADE: OK?

00:37:20.479 --> 00:37:22.600
They can't engage.

00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:26.770
They can't engage around
anything but their hunger.

00:37:26.770 --> 00:37:29.380
If a kid feels unsafe--

00:37:29.380 --> 00:37:31.974
I see all these safety
plans for schools,

00:37:31.974 --> 00:37:33.640
and the only thing
they're talking about

00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:36.100
is physical safety.

00:37:36.100 --> 00:37:37.490
Physical safety.

00:37:37.490 --> 00:37:41.050
And what that presumes is that
all the other layers of safety

00:37:41.050 --> 00:37:45.050
are de facto, and they're
not for kids of color.

00:37:45.050 --> 00:37:47.390
They're not for
language learners.

00:37:47.390 --> 00:37:49.240
They're not for girls.

00:37:49.240 --> 00:37:52.600
They're not for your
lesbian, gay, trans kids.

00:37:52.600 --> 00:37:53.340
They're not.

00:37:53.340 --> 00:37:57.660
Those safeties, those identity
safeties are not de facto.

00:37:57.660 --> 00:37:59.960
So physical safety,
super important,

00:37:59.960 --> 00:38:01.900
but so is identity safety.

00:38:01.900 --> 00:38:04.420
Are the children safe
to show up and be

00:38:04.420 --> 00:38:11.020
who they really are culturally,
linguistically, sexually?

00:38:11.020 --> 00:38:14.020
Because if they're not,
what can't they do?

00:38:14.020 --> 00:38:14.990
Can't learn.

00:38:14.990 --> 00:38:17.410
If you're unsafe, you can't--

00:38:17.410 --> 00:38:19.340
we know this.

00:38:19.340 --> 00:38:22.280
There is no debate
in the research

00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:24.410
field about these things.

00:38:24.410 --> 00:38:27.380
And yet the
transference to schools

00:38:27.380 --> 00:38:30.650
has not happened in a way
that is true and authentic

00:38:30.650 --> 00:38:34.700
and embedded wall to wall,
tip to finish, edge to edge.

00:38:34.700 --> 00:38:36.380
Because we push off
of this and we get

00:38:36.380 --> 00:38:39.260
sucked into Pearson and
Houghton Mifflin and Common

00:38:39.260 --> 00:38:44.441
Core, when this is Common Core.

00:38:44.441 --> 00:38:46.820
And you know who knows this?

00:38:46.820 --> 00:38:49.590
Wealthy schools.

00:38:49.590 --> 00:38:51.590
This is where they always start.

00:38:51.590 --> 00:38:53.210
Are kids safe?

00:38:53.210 --> 00:38:55.310
Are they clothed and fed?

00:38:55.310 --> 00:38:58.750
Do they have a sense
of love and belonging?

00:38:58.750 --> 00:39:01.390
Do they feel good
about themselves?

00:39:01.390 --> 00:39:03.100
Basic stuff.

00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:06.820
And when the basics are
met, it is a biological fact

00:39:06.820 --> 00:39:09.790
that the human being
will self-actualize.

00:39:09.790 --> 00:39:12.570
If you have children
in your schools,

00:39:12.570 --> 00:39:15.310
if you have teachers
in your schools

00:39:15.310 --> 00:39:18.220
that are not
self-actualizing, we

00:39:18.220 --> 00:39:21.070
are crystal clear in
the research about why.

00:39:21.070 --> 00:39:26.390
Something underneath it is
unstable or under attack.

00:39:26.390 --> 00:39:29.770
It has nothing to do with
whether the kid's black, brown,

00:39:29.770 --> 00:39:34.350
purple, pink, tall,
short, fast, or slow.

00:39:34.350 --> 00:39:38.400
What we know in the research
is that any human being who

00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:41.370
has their basic
needs under attack

00:39:41.370 --> 00:39:44.160
will not consistently
self-actualize.

00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:46.140
What that means is this.

00:39:46.140 --> 00:39:48.930
No child that you
serve is broken,

00:39:48.930 --> 00:39:52.260
so don't try to fix them.

00:39:52.260 --> 00:39:53.830
We're spending all
this time trying

00:39:53.830 --> 00:39:55.240
to fix stuff that ain't broke.

00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:57.502
Didn't your mama ever tell
you if it ain't broke--

00:39:57.502 --> 00:39:58.460
AUDIENCE: Don't fix it.

00:39:58.460 --> 00:39:59.270
JEFF DUNCAN-ANDRADE:
Don't fix it.

00:39:59.270 --> 00:40:00.337
Don't fix these kids.

00:40:00.337 --> 00:40:01.670
There's nothing wrong with them.

00:40:01.670 --> 00:40:03.730
There's something wrong
with this society.

00:40:03.730 --> 00:40:06.490
There's something wrong with the
systems we're putting them in.

00:40:06.490 --> 00:40:08.410
That's what has to be fixed.

00:40:08.410 --> 00:40:13.360
So when a kid is off the
mark, become a bulldozer.

00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:16.720
What we know in the research
is the most effective teachers

00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:19.870
of vulnerable youth
are bulldozers.

00:40:19.870 --> 00:40:23.710
And what I mean is that they
figure out what's in the way,

00:40:23.710 --> 00:40:26.170
and they clear it
out so that the kid

00:40:26.170 --> 00:40:28.240
can be who they already are.

00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:34.530
Can you see every child that
you serve as GATE, as gifted

00:40:34.530 --> 00:40:35.590
and talented?

00:40:35.590 --> 00:40:36.690
Because just [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:36.690 --> 00:40:38.880
So y'all get GATE
programs in your schools?

00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:41.180
Gifted and talented
programs in your schools?

00:40:41.180 --> 00:40:43.510
OK, just peek this
game for a minute, OK?

00:40:43.510 --> 00:40:50.072
If this table is the GATE
table, then they are what?

00:40:50.072 --> 00:40:52.790
They are gifted and talented.

00:40:52.790 --> 00:40:54.965
Well, what does that
make the rest of y'all?

00:40:54.965 --> 00:40:56.069
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:40:56.069 --> 00:40:57.110
JEFF DUNCAN-ANDRADE: Yep.

00:40:57.110 --> 00:40:58.070
OK.

00:40:58.070 --> 00:40:59.420
Every child is GATE.

00:40:59.420 --> 00:41:01.700
Not every child
performs as GATE.

00:41:01.700 --> 00:41:05.120
The question for us as
educators is, why not?

00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:06.710
Why not?

00:41:06.710 --> 00:41:10.370
If talent is equally distributed
throughout the population,

00:41:10.370 --> 00:41:14.240
which is what we absolutely
have landed on in all

00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:17.510
of our research in neuroscience
and biology and biochemistry,

00:41:17.510 --> 00:41:20.940
talent is randomly distributed
throughout the population,

00:41:20.940 --> 00:41:23.740
why isn't success?

00:41:23.740 --> 00:41:26.110
There must be
something systemically

00:41:26.110 --> 00:41:29.080
wrong with the way in
which we cultivate talent,

00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:32.260
and schools are a
major engine in that.

00:41:32.260 --> 00:41:35.770
And the ways in which we try
to cultivate talent oftentimes

00:41:35.770 --> 00:41:38.860
is by fixing kids who don't
fit in in the way that's

00:41:38.860 --> 00:41:41.170
convenient for us
instead of figuring out

00:41:41.170 --> 00:41:42.790
what we need to
clear out of the way

00:41:42.790 --> 00:41:44.620
so the kid can be
who they already are.

00:41:44.620 --> 00:41:49.180
That is the mind shift that we
make when we move to equity.

00:41:49.180 --> 00:41:52.150
Not everybody's going to get
the same thing at the same time.

00:41:52.150 --> 00:41:55.110
You're going to get what
you need when you need it.

00:41:55.110 --> 00:41:57.450
And the most vulnerable
youth are going to need more.

00:41:57.450 --> 00:42:00.230
A lot more.

00:42:00.230 --> 00:42:03.430
This is why Eduardo Galeano
says Western nation states have

00:42:03.430 --> 00:42:05.980
built a world upside down.

00:42:05.980 --> 00:42:09.300
A world upside down is where
those who need the least

00:42:09.300 --> 00:42:12.720
get the most and those who
need the most get the least.

00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:14.490
And that is the
working definition

00:42:14.490 --> 00:42:17.379
of our current society.

00:42:17.379 --> 00:42:18.920
We have to invert
that if we're going

00:42:18.920 --> 00:42:21.170
to be a pluralistic,
multiracial democracy.

00:42:21.170 --> 00:42:24.970
Those who need the most in
your school must get the most.

00:42:24.970 --> 00:42:26.930
And this is going
to be the hard sell.

00:42:26.930 --> 00:42:32.100
Those who need the least
are going to get least.

00:42:32.100 --> 00:42:33.050
That's the hard sell.

00:42:33.050 --> 00:42:35.210
Can you convince
families that have

00:42:35.210 --> 00:42:38.750
the most that it's actually
good for their kid for this kid

00:42:38.750 --> 00:42:41.830
to get more than their kid?

00:42:41.830 --> 00:42:45.130
And in a structured
school where your grade

00:42:45.130 --> 00:42:49.340
has nothing to do with your
grade, that's not possible.

00:42:49.340 --> 00:42:52.490
How do we create a
collectivity community

00:42:52.490 --> 00:42:55.400
that is building our collective
responsibility to one another

00:42:55.400 --> 00:42:57.500
where if you have a whole
hell of a lot of food

00:42:57.500 --> 00:43:02.390
and you ain't got no food, by
definition, you give it up?

00:43:02.390 --> 00:43:05.160
That's a pluralistic,
multiracial democracy.

00:43:05.160 --> 00:43:07.160
That's not what we're
norming in schools.

00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:08.950
Right now, what
we norm in schools

00:43:08.950 --> 00:43:10.880
is if you've got the
answer to the test

00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:13.820
and she don't and you give
them to her, you're a--

00:43:13.820 --> 00:43:14.570
AUDIENCE: Cheater.

00:43:14.570 --> 00:43:16.460
JEFF DUNCAN-ANDRADE: Cheater.

00:43:16.460 --> 00:43:19.040
Beginning in
kindergarten, we norm it.

00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:21.890
You share your knowledge,
you share your access

00:43:21.890 --> 00:43:25.820
to power and opportunity,
you're a cheater.

00:43:25.820 --> 00:43:28.070
It's actually bad for her.

00:43:28.070 --> 00:43:31.800
She got to pull herself
up by her boot straps.

00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:34.260
Then you'll really learn
the positive of work ethic

00:43:34.260 --> 00:43:38.290
and how to-- we're not
building collectivity.

00:43:38.290 --> 00:43:41.210
And the research
community is particularly

00:43:41.210 --> 00:43:43.630
concerned about this
because of what's

00:43:43.630 --> 00:43:46.610
showing up in health
and wellness data

00:43:46.610 --> 00:43:48.590
like the Peace Index.

00:43:48.590 --> 00:43:50.850
We don't have a peaceful
society, and schools

00:43:50.850 --> 00:43:54.350
and norming that just with
basic, structural, day-to-day

00:43:54.350 --> 00:43:57.000
functioning.

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:00.720
Now I must say about Maslow,
what Maslow said himself

00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:03.330
that the rest of the
nation continually ignores

00:44:03.330 --> 00:44:04.770
when they talk about his work.

00:44:04.770 --> 00:44:07.500
That Maslow did not come up
with the hierarchy of needs.

00:44:07.500 --> 00:44:09.540
Maslow appropriated it.

00:44:09.540 --> 00:44:11.800
Maslow took the concept
of the hierarchy of needs

00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:14.620
from the Blackfoot
people, Blackfoot nation.

00:44:14.620 --> 00:44:18.510
Breath of life is what we call
it in indigenous communities.

00:44:18.510 --> 00:44:24.540
It's an inverted triangle where
self-actualization actually

00:44:24.540 --> 00:44:29.370
sits on the bottom, and the
ultimate goal, the highest form

00:44:29.370 --> 00:44:33.880
of community and collectivity
is cultural perpetuation,

00:44:33.880 --> 00:44:35.610
the passing along.

00:44:35.610 --> 00:44:39.960
Culture, identity,
language, traditions.

00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:43.260
That's a sustainable
nation state.

00:44:43.260 --> 00:44:47.351
Because now you must connect
with people in your community

00:44:47.351 --> 00:44:47.850
to do that.

00:44:47.850 --> 00:44:50.840
You cannot do that alone.

00:44:50.840 --> 00:44:52.490
Maslow inverts the paradigm.

00:44:52.490 --> 00:44:56.690
Says, yes, that that
is the healthy society.

00:44:56.690 --> 00:44:59.640
But we are so far
from that-- in 1943,

00:44:59.640 --> 00:45:03.380
we are so far from that in this
nation that we actually have

00:45:03.380 --> 00:45:05.210
to start with basic--

00:45:05.210 --> 00:45:08.270
we actually have built
a society that we

00:45:08.270 --> 00:45:12.290
have to say you have to
feed, clothe, shelter,

00:45:12.290 --> 00:45:14.370
and protect children.

00:45:14.370 --> 00:45:17.050
That's a messed up
society where you actually

00:45:17.050 --> 00:45:20.200
have to say those words,
but that's where we're at.

00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:23.650
Maslow says that very clearly
in his early work, right?

00:45:23.650 --> 00:45:26.110
He says that the
Blackfoot people have

00:45:26.110 --> 00:45:30.610
built a healthy,
sustainable society,

00:45:30.610 --> 00:45:33.620
and we're headed in
the wrong direction.

00:45:33.620 --> 00:45:36.730
So we've got to
reset and say first,

00:45:36.730 --> 00:45:40.480
all children must have food,
clothing, shelter, safety.

00:45:40.480 --> 00:45:41.530
Basic needs.

00:45:41.530 --> 00:45:43.870
Everybody has to have those met.

00:45:43.870 --> 00:45:46.870
Everybody has to have a
sense of love and belonging.

00:45:46.870 --> 00:45:50.290
Everybody has to have a sense
of self-love, self-esteem

00:45:50.290 --> 00:45:56.810
in order for us to then talk
about collective culture.

00:45:56.810 --> 00:46:00.530
It's important that
that is re-narrated

00:46:00.530 --> 00:46:04.250
as we talk about Maslow, that
this is not a Western idea.

00:46:04.250 --> 00:46:07.910
It's an indigenous idea
that has been largely

00:46:07.910 --> 00:46:10.460
attributed to
Western science when

00:46:10.460 --> 00:46:15.367
in fact, Western science got
the idea from indigenous people.

00:46:15.367 --> 00:46:17.450
Now the second part of the
talk, what I want to do

00:46:17.450 --> 00:46:20.400
is armor you up to
go do this work.

00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:23.540
I want you to know that
the research is completely

00:46:23.540 --> 00:46:25.550
on your side.

00:46:25.550 --> 00:46:27.230
In the research
community, we don't even

00:46:27.230 --> 00:46:29.960
debate this stuff anymore.

00:46:29.960 --> 00:46:34.120
We're just trying to
figure out how to go from--

00:46:34.120 --> 00:46:35.890
how to close the
knowing-doing gap.

00:46:35.890 --> 00:46:36.760
Because we know.

00:46:36.760 --> 00:46:41.320
We actually have really, really
conclusive, good research,

00:46:41.320 --> 00:46:44.530
but we're not doing
it on the ground.

00:46:44.530 --> 00:46:48.650
That's the gap we've got to
close in this generation.

00:46:48.650 --> 00:46:52.410
How do we do what we know
we're supposed to do?

00:46:52.410 --> 00:46:55.350
What we find in the research is
the most successful educators

00:46:55.350 --> 00:46:57.540
focus on those three
things that I called out

00:46:57.540 --> 00:46:58.890
around self-actualization.

00:46:58.890 --> 00:47:01.920
Relationships, relevance,
and responsibility.

00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:05.730
When the policy rain comes,
they've got an umbrella,

00:47:05.730 --> 00:47:08.795
and that umbrella is
called good teaching.

00:47:08.795 --> 00:47:10.170
They just throw
that umbrella up,

00:47:10.170 --> 00:47:13.520
and they know at the end of the
day, relationships, relevance,

00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:16.380
responsibility, and my
kids are going to be fine.

00:47:16.380 --> 00:47:17.852
My classroom's going to be fine.

00:47:17.852 --> 00:47:19.060
My school's going to be fine.

00:47:19.060 --> 00:47:21.435
I'm not going to get caught
up in latest, greatest ideas.

00:47:21.435 --> 00:47:24.060
Relevance-- excuse me,
relationships, relevance,

00:47:24.060 --> 00:47:25.020
responsibility.

00:47:25.020 --> 00:47:27.360
And the research bears
this out time and time

00:47:27.360 --> 00:47:28.937
again for four-plus decades.

00:47:28.937 --> 00:47:31.020
So I'm going to armor you
up with some of the best

00:47:31.020 --> 00:47:32.970
research we have
so you don't even

00:47:32.970 --> 00:47:36.930
have to have the debate,
because it's a false debate.

00:47:36.930 --> 00:47:38.520
It's a false debate.

00:47:38.520 --> 00:47:40.830
It's a debate over
ideology instead

00:47:40.830 --> 00:47:42.090
of what's good for kids.

00:47:42.090 --> 00:47:45.330
And any time you get into
an ideological debate

00:47:45.330 --> 00:47:51.140
with people who aren't
moral, it ends in stalemate.

00:47:51.140 --> 00:47:53.330
And our goal with the
research and our practice

00:47:53.330 --> 00:47:56.600
is to end the debate.

00:47:56.600 --> 00:47:59.630
Because we know what works,
we know how it works,

00:47:59.630 --> 00:48:01.880
and we know why it works,
and I want everybody

00:48:01.880 --> 00:48:05.120
leaving here armored
up with the best

00:48:05.120 --> 00:48:10.790
research we have in the nation
for why those things are true

00:48:10.790 --> 00:48:14.670
and with an image burned in your
mind about what it looks like.

00:48:14.670 --> 00:48:16.400
So for each of these
three, I'm going

00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:20.270
to give you a live look
into a classroom or a school

00:48:20.270 --> 00:48:23.660
that we've worked with that are
doing this as well or better

00:48:23.660 --> 00:48:26.240
than anybody else on the
planet, because two of them

00:48:26.240 --> 00:48:29.430
are actually going
to be international.

00:48:29.430 --> 00:48:32.750
So we start with relationships,
because at the end

00:48:32.750 --> 00:48:36.069
of the day, if you've taught
for a day, you know this.

00:48:36.069 --> 00:48:38.110
The end of the day, teaching
and learning always,

00:48:38.110 --> 00:48:40.330
always, always boils
down to relationships.

00:48:40.330 --> 00:48:42.540
We keep trying to
change the curriculum,

00:48:42.540 --> 00:48:44.470
but we're not changing
relationships.

00:48:44.470 --> 00:48:46.450
Curriculum won't save you.

00:48:46.450 --> 00:48:50.800
Curriculum matters, but
curriculum won't save you.

00:48:50.800 --> 00:48:52.300
At the end of day,
it's going to be,

00:48:52.300 --> 00:48:53.760
can we build better
relationships

00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:56.260
with the kids and the families
that feel really disconnected

00:48:56.260 --> 00:48:57.330
from our institutions?

00:48:57.330 --> 00:49:00.810
So Herb Kohl who is
not far from here,

00:49:00.810 --> 00:49:04.910
a longtime faculty member at
the University of San Francisco,

00:49:04.910 --> 00:49:06.660
wrote this book, "I
Won't Learn From You."

00:49:06.660 --> 00:49:08.451
And it's one of my
all-time favorite books,

00:49:08.451 --> 00:49:10.350
because it's one of
the only studies--

00:49:10.350 --> 00:49:15.030
comprehensive studies we
have of students that fail,

00:49:15.030 --> 00:49:20.560
and seeing their failure as
conscious and deliberate.

00:49:20.560 --> 00:49:21.520
Yeah.

00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:24.520
This flipped my wig, right?

00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:26.110
Because Herb says,
how many of you

00:49:26.110 --> 00:49:28.094
have kids that
show up to class--

00:49:28.094 --> 00:49:30.010
you don't even know what
I'm going to ask yet.

00:49:30.010 --> 00:49:30.560
You raise--

00:49:30.560 --> 00:49:32.010
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:32.509 --> 00:49:33.550
Yeah, how many have kids?

00:49:33.550 --> 00:49:34.633
How many of you have kids?

00:49:34.633 --> 00:49:35.395
Just show a hands.

00:49:35.395 --> 00:49:35.710
All right.

00:49:35.710 --> 00:49:36.210
Yeah.

00:49:36.210 --> 00:49:37.870
All the parents in the room, OK?

00:49:37.870 --> 00:49:38.830
Happy Parents Day.

00:49:38.830 --> 00:49:39.445
OK.

00:49:39.445 --> 00:49:43.607
So how many of you have
kids, students, youth--

00:49:43.607 --> 00:49:45.190
OK, sorry, I asked
the wrong question.

00:49:45.190 --> 00:49:47.110
It's always on me.

00:49:47.110 --> 00:49:52.439
That show up to class,
like damn near every day,

00:49:52.439 --> 00:49:54.730
and then you get to marking
period, you get to grading,

00:49:54.730 --> 00:49:56.350
and you look, and they've
got straight-up zeros

00:49:56.350 --> 00:49:56.680
in the grade book.

00:49:56.680 --> 00:49:58.120
How many of you have that kid?

00:49:58.120 --> 00:50:00.260
OK?

00:50:00.260 --> 00:50:04.386
Herb Kohl says, that's you're
most committed student.

00:50:04.386 --> 00:50:06.378
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:06.378 --> 00:50:08.370
That's some hard shit to do.

00:50:08.370 --> 00:50:10.870
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:10.870 --> 00:50:13.878
Show up every day
and do nothing.

00:50:13.878 --> 00:50:16.626
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:16.626 --> 00:50:18.007
Try that one time.

00:50:18.007 --> 00:50:19.340
How many principals in the room?

00:50:19.340 --> 00:50:19.860
Principals?

00:50:19.860 --> 00:50:20.290
OK.

00:50:20.290 --> 00:50:20.450
OK.

00:50:20.450 --> 00:50:21.670
I'm going to do you
dirty right now.

00:50:21.670 --> 00:50:22.170
OK.

00:50:22.170 --> 00:50:22.730
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:22.730 --> 00:50:24.590
So for all the staff
members in the room,

00:50:24.590 --> 00:50:26.240
OK, here's what
I want you to do.

00:50:26.240 --> 00:50:26.740
All right?

00:50:26.740 --> 00:50:30.360
The next time you have
to go to a staff meeting

00:50:30.360 --> 00:50:34.672
or PD led by your principal,
here's your goal, all right?

00:50:34.672 --> 00:50:35.380
Here's your goal.

00:50:35.380 --> 00:50:38.710
I'm giving a very
clear, defined goal.

00:50:38.710 --> 00:50:39.970
Learn nothing.

00:50:39.970 --> 00:50:41.436
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:41.436 --> 00:50:42.560
Some of you are like, shit.

00:50:42.560 --> 00:50:43.518
That's every damn time.

00:50:43.518 --> 00:50:46.330
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:46.330 --> 00:50:49.540
Learn nothing, OK?

00:50:49.540 --> 00:50:53.870
Herb Kohl called it
willed not learning.

00:50:53.870 --> 00:50:56.360
He says it takes a
conscious effort.

00:50:56.360 --> 00:51:01.470
You must will yourself to
sit in school and not learn.

00:51:01.470 --> 00:51:03.080
Hey And he came
to understand this

00:51:03.080 --> 00:51:06.930
by interviewing the least
successful students.

00:51:06.930 --> 00:51:10.225
And what he found is they're
excellent at what they're

00:51:10.225 --> 00:51:12.350
attempting to do, and what
they're attempting to do

00:51:12.350 --> 00:51:16.000
is protect themselves from us.

00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:18.140
And so they come
to school every day

00:51:18.140 --> 00:51:21.000
because the other option
is going to lockup.

00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:23.970
So they come to school every
day with a conscious commitment

00:51:23.970 --> 00:51:26.700
that, I won't learn from you.

00:51:26.700 --> 00:51:30.120
And he's like, that
makes no sense to me.

00:51:30.120 --> 00:51:33.600
It's brilliant, but it
makes no sense to me.

00:51:33.600 --> 00:51:35.910
And he said-- and
one kid says to him,

00:51:35.910 --> 00:51:38.100
he says, I don't
care what you know

00:51:38.100 --> 00:51:43.050
until I know that you care, and
I know these people don't care.

00:51:43.050 --> 00:51:46.640
And it doesn't matter
if we think we care.

00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:48.590
Care is not about
what you think.

00:51:48.590 --> 00:51:51.140
It's about whether or not
the recipient of your care

00:51:51.140 --> 00:51:52.460
feels cared about.

00:51:52.460 --> 00:51:54.110
And we've got so
many kids in schools

00:51:54.110 --> 00:51:55.880
that don't feel cared about.

00:51:55.880 --> 00:51:57.260
That's the starting point.

00:51:57.260 --> 00:51:58.430
Basic needs.

00:51:58.430 --> 00:52:02.510
Food, clothing, shelter, safety.

00:52:02.510 --> 00:52:04.580
Love and belonging.

00:52:04.580 --> 00:52:08.420
Interview your least
successful students.

00:52:08.420 --> 00:52:11.210
Try to understand
that they are actually

00:52:11.210 --> 00:52:13.525
some of your most
successful students,

00:52:13.525 --> 00:52:15.650
because they're achieving
exactly what they set out

00:52:15.650 --> 00:52:17.680
to achieve.

00:52:17.680 --> 00:52:19.970
If we don't understand
that, we can't pivot them

00:52:19.970 --> 00:52:21.070
in another direction.

00:52:21.070 --> 00:52:23.090
There's wonderful
research on this.

00:52:23.090 --> 00:52:25.970
Herb Kohl's a great
starting point.

00:52:25.970 --> 00:52:27.970
But the research goes
on and on and on.

00:52:27.970 --> 00:52:30.736
This afternoon, I'm going
to be down at Stanford

00:52:30.736 --> 00:52:32.110
doing some work
with these folks.

00:52:32.110 --> 00:52:33.594
Robert Sapolsky.

00:52:33.594 --> 00:52:35.135
He just had a great
interview on NPR.

00:52:35.135 --> 00:52:38.020
If you're an NPR fan, you can
hear some of his latest work.

00:52:38.020 --> 00:52:41.290
Robert Sapolsky is considered
the world's leading researcher

00:52:41.290 --> 00:52:43.364
on stress.

00:52:43.364 --> 00:52:45.030
His book, "Why Zebras
Don't get Ulcers,"

00:52:45.030 --> 00:52:48.270
is mandatory reading in
every single medical field.

00:52:48.270 --> 00:52:51.720
Social epidemiology, public
health, neuroscience, medicine.

00:52:51.720 --> 00:52:53.730
Everybody has to read Sapolsky.

00:52:53.730 --> 00:52:56.980
I find almost no teachers
have ever read it,

00:52:56.980 --> 00:52:59.590
and I actually don't
recommend that you do, OK?

00:52:59.590 --> 00:53:03.238
Because this book is, like,
600 pages in six-point font.

00:53:03.238 --> 00:53:04.990
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:04.990 --> 00:53:10.450
However, there is a
wonderful National Geographic

00:53:10.450 --> 00:53:13.420
30-minute documentary
film on his work

00:53:13.420 --> 00:53:15.970
that is fantastic that
you can get on YouTube.

00:53:15.970 --> 00:53:18.320
OK, it's a great PD.

00:53:18.320 --> 00:53:20.260
It's called "Stress,"
the silent killer.

00:53:23.190 --> 00:53:23.690
OK.

00:53:27.620 --> 00:53:28.882
Brene Brown.

00:53:28.882 --> 00:53:30.590
Many people are familiar
with Brene Brown

00:53:30.590 --> 00:53:33.230
because her TED Talk blew up.

00:53:33.230 --> 00:53:35.227
A lot of folks don't know
that Brene Brown also

00:53:35.227 --> 00:53:37.310
wrote a "New York Times"
bestseller called "Daring

00:53:37.310 --> 00:53:41.540
Greatly" where she expands
and expounds upon what

00:53:41.540 --> 00:53:42.780
you hear in her TED Talk.

00:53:42.780 --> 00:53:47.180
So if you-- the TED Talk's a
great primer for vulnerability

00:53:47.180 --> 00:53:51.420
and understanding the difference
between sympathy and empathy.

00:53:51.420 --> 00:53:53.830
And what we see happening
a lot in schools

00:53:53.830 --> 00:53:56.200
in the relationships
with vulnerable youth

00:53:56.200 --> 00:53:58.640
is sympathetic relationships.

00:53:58.640 --> 00:54:02.950
So what is a sympathetic
relationship?

00:54:02.950 --> 00:54:04.820
AUDIENCE: When you
feel sorry for them.

00:54:04.820 --> 00:54:05.400
JEFF DUNCAN-ANDRADE: Right.

00:54:05.400 --> 00:54:05.899
OK?

00:54:05.899 --> 00:54:06.970
You feel sorry for them.

00:54:06.970 --> 00:54:09.850
Does anybody know what
happens to you biochemically

00:54:09.850 --> 00:54:13.510
and neurologically when you
have a sympathetic connection

00:54:13.510 --> 00:54:15.900
with somebody?

00:54:15.900 --> 00:54:18.980
What actually
happens inside you?

00:54:18.980 --> 00:54:20.840
Anybody know?

00:54:20.840 --> 00:54:23.070
That's what you want to
start understanding better.

00:54:23.070 --> 00:54:25.820
Don't understand the
external portrayal.

00:54:25.820 --> 00:54:28.240
Understand what's
going on inside.

00:54:28.240 --> 00:54:30.150
Because if you change
what's going on inside,

00:54:30.150 --> 00:54:32.720
you're going change
what's coming out, OK?

00:54:32.720 --> 00:54:35.170
So what's going on inside
your body if I have--

00:54:35.170 --> 00:54:37.970
if I have a sympathetic
connection to her,

00:54:37.970 --> 00:54:39.174
I feel sorry for you--

00:54:39.174 --> 00:54:40.090
I don't know why yet--

00:54:42.680 --> 00:54:47.108
what's going on in my
brain and my biochemistry?

00:54:47.108 --> 00:54:48.494
AUDIENCE: I mean,
are you at all?

00:54:48.494 --> 00:54:50.810
JEFF DUNCAN-ANDRADE: Nothing.

00:54:50.810 --> 00:54:52.170
Nothing.

00:54:52.170 --> 00:54:53.910
No shifts.

00:54:53.910 --> 00:54:57.304
What's going on in
her biochemistry?

00:54:57.304 --> 00:54:59.288
Nothing.

00:54:59.288 --> 00:55:03.270
It's a false connection.

00:55:03.270 --> 00:55:05.654
I'm glad I'm not you.

00:55:05.654 --> 00:55:06.630
Right?

00:55:06.630 --> 00:55:08.717
That's sympathy.

00:55:08.717 --> 00:55:11.482
What's empathy?

00:55:11.482 --> 00:55:13.607
AUDIENCE: Putting yourself
in someone else's shoes.

00:55:13.607 --> 00:55:14.096
JEFF DUNCAN-ANDRADE: Huh?

00:55:14.096 --> 00:55:14.590
AUDIENCE: Putting yourself--

00:55:14.590 --> 00:55:15.250
JEFF DUNCAN-ANDRADE:
Putting yourself

00:55:15.250 --> 00:55:16.960
in someone else's shoes.

00:55:16.960 --> 00:55:19.177
How many have young people
that say, I feel you?

00:55:19.177 --> 00:55:20.385
(DEEP VOICE) I feel you, dog.

00:55:20.385 --> 00:55:20.940
I feel you.

00:55:20.940 --> 00:55:22.240
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:22.240 --> 00:55:24.670
They're literally
expressing empathy.

00:55:24.670 --> 00:55:26.860
Empathy is, I feel you.

00:55:26.860 --> 00:55:29.620
If I have an empathetic
connection to her,

00:55:29.620 --> 00:55:35.590
what happens to my neural
pathways and my biochemistry?

00:55:35.590 --> 00:55:37.680
Exploding.

00:55:37.680 --> 00:55:41.110
What happens to
her neurochemistry?

00:55:41.110 --> 00:55:43.920
Exploding, because
it's connection.

00:55:43.920 --> 00:55:44.940
I feel you.

00:55:44.940 --> 00:55:47.380
I literally feel your pain.

00:55:47.380 --> 00:55:49.440
I feel your joy.

00:55:49.440 --> 00:55:52.740
That connectedness is
what Brene Brown's work

00:55:52.740 --> 00:55:54.450
has helped us understand.

00:55:54.450 --> 00:55:58.400
The false connection of
sympathy and the vulnerability

00:55:58.400 --> 00:56:01.860
that is required to make
an empathic connection.

00:56:01.860 --> 00:56:04.200
And the bioregistry
that we see when

00:56:04.200 --> 00:56:08.770
you make an empathic
connection is off the charts.

00:56:08.770 --> 00:56:10.500
And what's most
compelling about what

00:56:10.500 --> 00:56:12.390
we find that's
happening in the body

00:56:12.390 --> 00:56:14.250
when you have an
empathic connection

00:56:14.250 --> 00:56:20.430
is your massive release of
oxytocin, the happy chemical.

00:56:20.430 --> 00:56:24.570
It is so good for your body
to make empathic connections,

00:56:24.570 --> 00:56:27.900
and it's so good
for your body too.

00:56:27.900 --> 00:56:31.140
It's really, really
good for your teachers

00:56:31.140 --> 00:56:35.250
to learn how to make deep
connections with youth.

00:56:35.250 --> 00:56:39.170
It's good for their
longevity in the profession.

00:56:39.170 --> 00:56:40.850
The list goes on and on and on.

00:56:40.850 --> 00:56:45.140
Nations, leading researchers
all agreeing about the pathway

00:56:45.140 --> 00:56:47.450
to relationships, particularly
with vulnerable people

00:56:47.450 --> 00:56:50.810
and youth, and why
they matter so much.

00:56:50.810 --> 00:56:52.680
There's no debate in the field.

00:56:52.680 --> 00:56:55.160
The question-- there's no
debate in the research field.

00:56:55.160 --> 00:56:56.900
The question the
practice field has

00:56:56.900 --> 00:57:01.800
to get more complex and more
committed to how, when, where,

00:57:01.800 --> 00:57:04.010
and why.

00:57:04.010 --> 00:57:10.880
Now I'm going to show you a look
in on a teacher's classroom who

00:57:10.880 --> 00:57:14.790
does this as well, if not better
than anybody in the world.

00:57:14.790 --> 00:57:18.560
His name's Mr. Kanamori's
They made a documentary film

00:57:18.560 --> 00:57:20.840
about him when he won the
National Teacher of the Year

00:57:20.840 --> 00:57:23.360
in Japan.

00:57:23.360 --> 00:57:25.380
So this is also a great PD.

00:57:25.380 --> 00:57:28.390
It's called "Children
Full of Life."

00:57:28.390 --> 00:57:30.550
Amazing, because it
follows his classroom

00:57:30.550 --> 00:57:33.310
over the course of the
year, and it disabuses

00:57:33.310 --> 00:57:37.060
people of the belief that
national teachers of the year

00:57:37.060 --> 00:57:39.970
don't have conflict
in their classroom.

00:57:39.970 --> 00:57:43.390
Because he's got hella beef in
his classroom with the kids.

00:57:43.390 --> 00:57:44.140
He gets mad.

00:57:44.140 --> 00:57:46.510
He loses his temper.

00:57:46.510 --> 00:57:47.480
He gets depressed.

00:57:47.480 --> 00:57:48.160
He get sad.

00:57:48.160 --> 00:57:49.960
He feels like he's failing.

00:57:49.960 --> 00:57:52.960
All the range-- the
gamut of emotions.

00:57:52.960 --> 00:57:56.320
And what he says is that I have
the exact same things happening

00:57:56.320 --> 00:57:58.550
in my class as every other
teacher in the country.

00:57:58.550 --> 00:58:01.810
The difference is I
just react differently.

00:58:01.810 --> 00:58:05.410
And I think that there's a sense
that really skilled teachers

00:58:05.410 --> 00:58:08.260
have this special pixie
dust that we blow on kids,

00:58:08.260 --> 00:58:10.305
and it's all good all the time.

00:58:10.305 --> 00:58:12.180
We've got to help all
our teachers understand

00:58:12.180 --> 00:58:14.471
that really good teachers,
the most successful teachers

00:58:14.471 --> 00:58:17.800
have the same beefs in
their classroom as you do.

00:58:17.800 --> 00:58:20.470
They just respond differently.

00:58:20.470 --> 00:58:22.360
Don't try to end the beef.

00:58:22.360 --> 00:58:24.840
Try to learn how to turn
it into teachable moments.

00:58:24.840 --> 00:58:27.670
The meaning is in
the mess, and we keep

00:58:27.670 --> 00:58:30.010
trying to sanitize education.

00:58:30.010 --> 00:58:32.940
It's a human project,
so by definition, it's

00:58:32.940 --> 00:58:34.160
going be messy.

00:58:34.160 --> 00:58:35.937
So can you learn
to love the mess?

00:58:35.937 --> 00:58:37.520
Because that's where
the meaning lies.

00:58:37.520 --> 00:58:39.540
Now you don't want to be
messy all the time, OK?

00:58:39.540 --> 00:58:41.470
Because then it's
just messy, right?

00:58:41.470 --> 00:58:43.680
There's got to be meaning
coming out of the mess.

00:58:43.680 --> 00:58:46.780
So I'm going to introduce
you to Kanamori's class

00:58:46.780 --> 00:58:50.460
as a way to literally
burn in your brain

00:58:50.460 --> 00:58:53.590
an image of what
it looks like when

00:58:53.590 --> 00:58:57.760
a teacher's primary
commitment is relationships.

00:58:57.760 --> 00:58:59.260
And we haven't
tested the sound yet,

00:58:59.260 --> 00:59:02.239
so I'm going to
see how this goes.

00:59:02.239 --> 00:59:03.280
I'm trusting you, Google.

00:59:03.280 --> 00:59:04.089
I'm trusting you.

00:59:04.089 --> 00:59:05.380
It's supposed to be technology.

00:59:05.380 --> 00:59:06.046
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:59:06.046 --> 00:59:09.460
- Late April, Ren [INAUDIBLE]
comes to class for the first

00:59:09.460 --> 00:59:11.740
time in four days.

00:59:11.740 --> 00:59:12.894
His grandmother died.

00:59:24.256 --> 00:59:27.584
In his notebook, Ren
writes about the death,

00:59:27.584 --> 00:59:31.976
the funeral, his loss.

00:59:45.750 --> 00:59:47.420
- They were worried.

00:59:47.420 --> 00:59:49.730
They didn't know
why Ren was away.

00:59:49.730 --> 00:59:54.272

and saddened by his loss.

her life.

talk about her father.

01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:40.943
She didn't want
to seem different.

01:01:40.943 --> 01:01:42.915
She paid a price.

[END PLAYBACK]

01:04:28.080 --> 01:04:31.014
JEFF DUNCAN-ANDRADE: That's--
that's master pedagogy.

01:04:33.860 --> 01:04:36.024
But what about time on task?

01:04:36.024 --> 01:04:38.409
[LAUGHTER]

01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:43.590
That's how you get the
highest achievement

01:04:43.590 --> 01:04:46.490
patterns in a nation.

01:04:46.490 --> 01:04:50.660
Relationships, not
drill and kill.

01:04:50.660 --> 01:04:52.730
Because out of
that empathy comes

01:04:52.730 --> 01:04:55.550
the deeper learning,
the connection

01:04:55.550 --> 01:04:57.230
to the concepts and the ideas.

01:04:57.230 --> 01:05:03.050
A reason to read,
a reason to write.

01:05:03.050 --> 01:05:04.750
Not for a test.

01:05:04.750 --> 01:05:10.020
No one in this room
remembers your test scores.

01:05:10.020 --> 01:05:14.100
In the larger scope of your
life, they're irrelevant.

01:05:14.100 --> 01:05:16.380
They matter in terms
of gateway access

01:05:16.380 --> 01:05:18.910
to institutions and power.

01:05:18.910 --> 01:05:21.210
But in terms of building
pluralistic, multiracial

01:05:21.210 --> 01:05:25.510
democracy, they have
almost zero value.

01:05:25.510 --> 01:05:28.330
So what are we trying to build?

01:05:28.330 --> 01:05:30.540
And if it's the
latter, then we've

01:05:30.540 --> 01:05:35.640
got to follow the
research and what we know

01:05:35.640 --> 01:05:38.770
has the biggest impact on
achievement in practice,

01:05:38.770 --> 01:05:39.840
which is relationships.

01:05:43.180 --> 01:05:44.730
Second is relevance.

01:05:44.730 --> 01:05:46.230
We get those kind
of relationships,

01:05:46.230 --> 01:05:47.490
then it's an open question.

01:05:47.490 --> 01:05:51.002
What are we actually
teaching these children?

01:05:51.002 --> 01:05:52.710
Now I'm in a lot of
schools that bring me

01:05:52.710 --> 01:05:55.980
in because they want to do some
iteration of ethnic studies.

01:05:55.980 --> 01:05:58.320
They want to be culturally
and community-responsive,

01:05:58.320 --> 01:05:59.910
culturally relevant.

01:05:59.910 --> 01:06:01.740
I am not a big
fan of checklists,

01:06:01.740 --> 01:06:04.020
but I'm going to give
you one right now.

01:06:04.020 --> 01:06:06.090
If you want to
check whether or not

01:06:06.090 --> 01:06:09.910
your curriculum and
pedagogy in your classrooms

01:06:09.910 --> 01:06:14.070
and in your school is culturally
and community-relevant,

01:06:14.070 --> 01:06:15.890
here's your checklist.

01:06:15.890 --> 01:06:20.550
Does it reflect students'
lives, their communities,

01:06:20.550 --> 01:06:22.770
their families, and their
ethnic, cultural, and

01:06:22.770 --> 01:06:25.160
linguistic histories?

01:06:25.160 --> 01:06:26.552
If it doesn't, the answer's no.

01:06:26.552 --> 01:06:28.510
You're not culturally
and community-responsive.

01:06:28.510 --> 01:06:30.510
If it does, you're
on a good path.

01:06:30.510 --> 01:06:32.990
Well, what that means
is that you're not

01:06:32.990 --> 01:06:34.580
going to have the
same curriculum

01:06:34.580 --> 01:06:40.460
school to school to school,
even in the same city, right?

01:06:40.460 --> 01:06:43.130
That's what it means to be
community and culturally

01:06:43.130 --> 01:06:47.570
responsive, is to first
assess, who are the children

01:06:47.570 --> 01:06:49.700
and families that I serve?

01:06:49.700 --> 01:06:51.380
And what is a
curriculum that connects

01:06:51.380 --> 01:06:55.580
to their lives, their
blocks, their families,

01:06:55.580 --> 01:06:58.100
and their ethnic, cultural,
and linguistic histories?

01:06:58.100 --> 01:07:02.060
That's what it means to
have a relevant education.

01:07:02.060 --> 01:07:06.680
And all of those things can be
scaffolded into Common Core.

01:07:06.680 --> 01:07:09.020
One of the few
upsides of Common Core

01:07:09.020 --> 01:07:12.170
is it actually opens
this window for us

01:07:12.170 --> 01:07:14.480
to be much more dynamic
in the way in which we

01:07:14.480 --> 01:07:17.510
design and deliver curriculum.

01:07:17.510 --> 01:07:20.600
And of course, the
research bears all this out

01:07:20.600 --> 01:07:22.100
across fields.

01:07:22.100 --> 01:07:25.670
There's no debate about whether
or not cultural and community

01:07:25.670 --> 01:07:26.435
relevance matters.

01:07:28.980 --> 01:07:31.360
Here's why.

01:07:31.360 --> 01:07:34.030
First, what we know
is that in classrooms

01:07:34.030 --> 01:07:35.950
where this is
happening, students

01:07:35.950 --> 01:07:39.740
have a stronger sense of self.

01:07:39.740 --> 01:07:43.430
And we know from the research
both from neuroscience

01:07:43.430 --> 01:07:45.350
and from psychology
that there is

01:07:45.350 --> 01:07:47.120
a direct connection
between knowledge

01:07:47.120 --> 01:07:49.490
of self and self-esteem.

01:07:49.490 --> 01:07:53.326
Where did you see self-esteem
in this presentation earlier?

01:07:53.326 --> 01:07:54.220
AUDIENCE: Maslow.

01:07:54.220 --> 01:07:56.310
JEFF DUNCAN-ANDRADE:
Where in Maslow?

01:07:56.310 --> 01:07:57.470
It's not at the top.

01:07:57.470 --> 01:07:58.050
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:07:58.050 --> 01:07:59.175
JEFF DUNCAN-ANDRADE: Right.

01:07:59.175 --> 01:08:01.880
It is the window into
self-actualization.

01:08:01.880 --> 01:08:05.670
No human being consistently
self-actualizes

01:08:05.670 --> 01:08:08.490
in an aspect of their life
where they do not have

01:08:08.490 --> 01:08:11.630
self-love, a sense of esteem.

01:08:11.630 --> 01:08:15.140
And we're dealing with kids all
over the country, particularly

01:08:15.140 --> 01:08:17.895
kids of color, that have been
taught to hate themselves.

01:08:17.895 --> 01:08:19.520
Taught to hate the
color of their skin,

01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:22.069
the texture of their hair,
the color of their eyes,

01:08:22.069 --> 01:08:24.859
the language they speak, the
neighborhood they come from,

01:08:24.859 --> 01:08:27.080
their family history.

01:08:27.080 --> 01:08:31.130
That has to be
eradicated in schools.

01:08:31.130 --> 01:08:33.740
How many students
graduate from your schools

01:08:33.740 --> 01:08:36.600
and say, I love myself?

01:08:36.600 --> 01:08:39.871
Because what we know in the
research is that if that's said

01:08:39.871 --> 01:08:42.120
and true, because there's
some kids that say they love

01:08:42.120 --> 01:08:43.920
themselves that really don't.

01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:46.140
But if that's said
and true, that person

01:08:46.140 --> 01:08:49.649
is on a trajectory to success.

01:08:49.649 --> 01:08:50.710
Self-love.

01:08:50.710 --> 01:08:53.310
But I find almost no schools
in the country measured that.

01:08:53.310 --> 01:08:54.779
You know what that means?

01:08:54.779 --> 01:08:56.899
It doesn't matter.

01:08:56.899 --> 01:08:58.819
Because we measure what matters.

01:08:58.819 --> 01:09:02.510
If love matters to you, if
self-esteem matters to you,

01:09:02.510 --> 01:09:05.930
start metricing it in your
classroom and your schools.

01:09:05.930 --> 01:09:09.410
And there are definitely
well-tested measures

01:09:09.410 --> 01:09:10.375
for those things.

01:09:10.375 --> 01:09:12.250
We also know that there's
a direct connection

01:09:12.250 --> 01:09:13.634
between self-esteem and hope.

01:09:17.290 --> 01:09:20.830
Hope has become
particularly centered

01:09:20.830 --> 01:09:26.680
in conversations in the medical
field around vulnerable youth,

01:09:26.680 --> 01:09:30.010
wounded youth, youth exposed
to high levels of trauma

01:09:30.010 --> 01:09:30.910
and toxic stress.

01:09:30.910 --> 01:09:33.040
Because what the
medical field has found

01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:36.250
is that hope is the only
consistent indicator

01:09:36.250 --> 01:09:38.229
that they've been able
to track and measure

01:09:38.229 --> 01:09:41.020
that directly links
to how well students

01:09:41.020 --> 01:09:44.020
navigate through toxic stress.

01:09:44.020 --> 01:09:47.740
The higher their hope levels,
the more resilient they are.

01:09:47.740 --> 01:09:51.310
There is a very clear metric
for hope, what you can measure.

01:09:51.310 --> 01:09:54.370
I use the Children's Hope Scale
in my high school classroom.

01:09:54.370 --> 01:09:57.190
It's the only thing
I baseline is hope,

01:09:57.190 --> 01:09:58.570
because I know the research.

01:09:58.570 --> 01:10:00.610
And I know if I move
the meter on hope,

01:10:00.610 --> 01:10:02.170
the reading, the
writing, the tests

01:10:02.170 --> 01:10:03.530
will take care of themselves.

01:10:03.530 --> 01:10:05.790
And I also know that
if I teach the hell out

01:10:05.790 --> 01:10:07.540
of the reading, the
writing, and the tests

01:10:07.540 --> 01:10:10.760
and I'm not attentive to hope
that it won't move for the kids

01:10:10.760 --> 01:10:12.370
that most need it to move.

01:10:12.370 --> 01:10:16.480
Charles Snyder developed
something called the Children's

01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:20.230
Hope Scale and hope theory.

01:10:20.230 --> 01:10:21.910
It's a very simple
scale that you

01:10:21.910 --> 01:10:24.430
can use to track hope
levels in your classrooms

01:10:24.430 --> 01:10:25.900
and in your schools.

01:10:25.900 --> 01:10:27.820
We know that there's
a direct relationship

01:10:27.820 --> 01:10:31.889
between hope and ability to
interrupt stereotype threat.

01:10:31.889 --> 01:10:34.180
How many of you have heard
of stereotype threat before?

01:10:34.180 --> 01:10:34.820
A few of you?

01:10:34.820 --> 01:10:35.320
OK.

01:10:35.320 --> 01:10:38.470
How many of you test
kids in your schools?

01:10:38.470 --> 01:10:40.377
You guys-- y'all don't test?

01:10:40.377 --> 01:10:41.460
I can just leave now then.

01:10:41.460 --> 01:10:42.940
You good.

01:10:42.940 --> 01:10:44.140
I test kids.

01:10:44.140 --> 01:10:45.190
I'm a teacher.

01:10:45.190 --> 01:10:46.490
I want to know.

01:10:46.490 --> 01:10:48.370
I want to know, do you know?

01:10:48.370 --> 01:10:50.070
I want some recall.

01:10:50.070 --> 01:10:51.340
OK.

01:10:51.340 --> 01:10:52.900
But if you're
going to test kids,

01:10:52.900 --> 01:10:54.250
know the research on testing.

01:10:54.250 --> 01:10:59.110
Claude Steele developed a
concept called stereotype

01:10:59.110 --> 01:11:02.830
threat, because he wanted
to understand-- how many

01:11:02.830 --> 01:11:06.910
of you have students who can do
the work and then they sit exam

01:11:06.910 --> 01:11:08.560
and they choke?

01:11:08.560 --> 01:11:11.290
We now have very clear
neurological science

01:11:11.290 --> 01:11:13.642
on why that happens, OK?

01:11:13.642 --> 01:11:15.100
Here's what happens,
and here's why

01:11:15.100 --> 01:11:20.130
it happens
disproportionately to kids

01:11:20.130 --> 01:11:24.950
of color, poor kids, and girls.

01:11:24.950 --> 01:11:26.510
It's called stereotype threat.

01:11:26.510 --> 01:11:30.230
So what happens when
you sit exam, any exam,

01:11:30.230 --> 01:11:36.290
any test that you believe is a
measure of your innate ability,

01:11:36.290 --> 01:11:39.110
and the stereotype about
your group is that you're not

01:11:39.110 --> 01:11:43.400
innately good at it, you have
a biochemical reaction that

01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:46.940
literally fires inside
your brain and interrupts

01:11:46.940 --> 01:11:49.820
your neural pathways
so that you literally,

01:11:49.820 --> 01:11:53.390
biologically cannot
recall things you know.

01:11:53.390 --> 01:11:55.940
Your neural pathways
get blocked.

01:11:55.940 --> 01:11:58.580
We have crystal clear
research evidence on this.

01:12:01.430 --> 01:12:03.530
So Claude was particularly
interested in why this

01:12:03.530 --> 01:12:05.910
is happening for kids of color.

01:12:05.910 --> 01:12:07.460
So he releases
all this research.

01:12:07.460 --> 01:12:09.990
And probably the
book I'd start with

01:12:09.990 --> 01:12:13.700
is a book called
"Whistling Vivaldi."

01:12:13.700 --> 01:12:16.720
The way in which stereotype
threat affects kids of color

01:12:16.720 --> 01:12:18.380
is very clear to us.

01:12:18.380 --> 01:12:20.240
But the larger research
community is like--

01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:21.190
Claude's at Stanford.

01:12:21.190 --> 01:12:22.510
And they're like, OK, Claude.

01:12:22.510 --> 01:12:24.220
Like, if that's
really true, there

01:12:24.220 --> 01:12:27.110
are stereotypes about
everybody, so stereotype threat

01:12:27.110 --> 01:12:28.550
will affect everybody.

01:12:28.550 --> 01:12:31.340
And Claude goes, yeah, it will.

01:12:31.340 --> 01:12:32.860
But I'm not interested
in everybody.

01:12:32.860 --> 01:12:34.220
I'm focused on kids of color.

01:12:34.220 --> 01:12:36.800
Why do I have to prove it
happens to white people for it

01:12:36.800 --> 01:12:39.650
to matter for people of color?

01:12:39.650 --> 01:12:40.670
You guys go prove that.

01:12:40.670 --> 01:12:42.419
They're like, OK, we will.

01:12:42.419 --> 01:12:44.460
So they said, if it's
true, then it'll definitely

01:12:44.460 --> 01:12:45.450
happen to women.

01:12:45.450 --> 01:12:47.220
Claude said, yep, it will.

01:12:47.220 --> 01:12:50.762
So they conducted a study
with women mathematicians,

01:12:50.762 --> 01:12:52.470
because what's the
stereotype about women

01:12:52.470 --> 01:12:53.550
in math and science?

01:12:53.550 --> 01:12:54.496
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:12:54.496 --> 01:12:56.370
JEFF DUNCAN-ANDRADE:
Not innately good at it.

01:12:56.370 --> 01:12:58.890
Not part of your genetic makeup.

01:12:58.890 --> 01:13:01.170
So he took a group--
or this research team

01:13:01.170 --> 01:13:04.410
took a group of women
mathematicians, which

01:13:04.410 --> 01:13:05.956
means they can do what?

01:13:05.956 --> 01:13:06.580
AUDIENCE: Math.

01:13:06.580 --> 01:13:07.663
JEFF DUNCAN-ANDRADE: Math.

01:13:07.663 --> 01:13:08.764
[LAUGHTER]

01:13:09.459 --> 01:13:11.750
And they took them through
this series of problem sets,

01:13:11.750 --> 01:13:16.740
and they did it just fine,
because they're mathematicians.

01:13:16.740 --> 01:13:18.715
And then they sat an exam.

01:13:18.715 --> 01:13:20.715
They put the same problem
sets in front of them,

01:13:20.715 --> 01:13:22.256
and they said, this
test will measure

01:13:22.256 --> 01:13:24.160
your innate
mathematical ability.

01:13:24.160 --> 01:13:25.550
Go.

01:13:25.550 --> 01:13:27.985
And they all underperformed.

01:13:27.985 --> 01:13:29.380
They said, oh my goodness.

01:13:29.380 --> 01:13:31.050
Claude might be right.

01:13:31.050 --> 01:13:32.881
But there's one final test.

01:13:32.881 --> 01:13:35.647
Who's the final test?

01:13:35.647 --> 01:13:36.379
AUDIENCE: Men.

01:13:36.379 --> 01:13:37.670
JEFF DUNCAN-ANDRADE: Which men?

01:13:37.670 --> 01:13:38.503
AUDIENCE: White men.

01:13:38.503 --> 01:13:39.910
JEFF DUNCAN-ANDRADE: White men.

01:13:39.910 --> 01:13:41.650
Because there are stereotypes
about white men too,

01:13:41.650 --> 01:13:42.191
aren't there?

01:13:42.191 --> 01:13:42.900
White men can't--

01:13:42.900 --> 01:13:43.388
AUDIENCE: Jump.

01:13:43.388 --> 01:13:43.876
AUDIENCE: Jump.

01:13:43.876 --> 01:13:44.364
JEFF DUNCAN-ANDRADE: Jump.

01:13:44.364 --> 01:13:44.852
And white--

01:13:44.852 --> 01:13:45.352
[LAUGHTER]

01:13:45.352 --> 01:13:47.600
AUDIENCE: Can't dance.

01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:49.910
JEFF DUNCAN-ANDRADE: And she
added in for extra spite,

01:13:49.910 --> 01:13:50.957
can't dance either.

01:13:50.957 --> 01:13:53.995
[LAUGHTER]

01:13:53.995 --> 01:13:54.870
White men can't jump.

01:13:54.870 --> 01:13:56.540
White men can't dance.

01:13:56.540 --> 01:14:01.650
So UCLA conducts a
study with a group

01:14:01.650 --> 01:14:05.670
of white male undergrads who
were all highly accomplished

01:14:05.670 --> 01:14:07.684
high school athletes.

01:14:07.684 --> 01:14:09.600
Now a lot of people come
to undergrad and say,

01:14:09.600 --> 01:14:11.540
I was an accomplished
high school athlete,

01:14:11.540 --> 01:14:13.410
and it's not even true.

01:14:13.410 --> 01:14:14.400
So they tested it.

01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:17.880
Indeed, these young men were
all very skilled, capable,

01:14:17.880 --> 01:14:19.980
high-end athletes.

01:14:19.980 --> 01:14:22.560
And then they sat an
exam and they said,

01:14:22.560 --> 01:14:25.290
this test will measure your
innate athletic ability.

01:14:25.290 --> 01:14:27.510
And guess what happened?

01:14:27.510 --> 01:14:29.520
They all underperformed.

01:14:29.520 --> 01:14:32.400
And the difference
between white men

01:14:32.400 --> 01:14:35.070
and some women and
kids of color is

01:14:35.070 --> 01:14:37.380
there isn't a stereotype
about white men

01:14:37.380 --> 01:14:39.760
not being good at school.

01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:42.760
So when they sit exam,
the biochemistry registers

01:14:42.760 --> 01:14:44.410
don't shift.

01:14:44.410 --> 01:14:45.730
They know they can do school.

01:14:45.730 --> 01:14:49.080
There's lots of evidence
they can do school.

01:14:49.080 --> 01:14:51.360
But with kids of
color, that question

01:14:51.360 --> 01:14:54.000
is always in the back of your
mind, even if you don't say,

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.440
this test innately
measures your ability.

01:14:56.440 --> 01:14:57.390
You interview kids.

01:14:57.390 --> 01:14:59.850
You find out they think
that the test measures

01:14:59.850 --> 01:15:02.750
their innate ability.

01:15:02.750 --> 01:15:04.430
So Claude is very
clear about what

01:15:04.430 --> 01:15:07.970
you can do with somebody who
needs to test kids to interrupt

01:15:07.970 --> 01:15:09.800
stereotype threat.

01:15:09.800 --> 01:15:11.630
And this is part of
the pattern, but there

01:15:11.630 --> 01:15:15.110
are things you can do tomorrow
when you sit kids exam that you

01:15:15.110 --> 01:15:18.599
can say that will alleviate
some of that neuro blockage

01:15:18.599 --> 01:15:20.390
and will allow them to
perform at the level

01:15:20.390 --> 01:15:22.760
that they're actually at.

01:15:22.760 --> 01:15:24.650
And this creates
what researchers

01:15:24.650 --> 01:15:27.320
call a Pygmalion effect, OK?

01:15:27.320 --> 01:15:30.500
The Pygmalion effect is the
self-fulfilling prophecy.

01:15:30.500 --> 01:15:33.070
I am whatever you say I am.

01:15:33.070 --> 01:15:35.570
Research is crystal clear
that the single biggest

01:15:35.570 --> 01:15:39.770
factor impacting student
achievement in a classroom--

01:15:39.770 --> 01:15:41.780
anybody know what it is?

01:15:41.780 --> 01:15:44.059
Parent income, parent
education, ZIP Code--

01:15:44.059 --> 01:15:45.350
AUDIENCE: Teacher expectations.

01:15:45.350 --> 01:15:47.100
JEFF DUNCAN-ANDRADE:
Teacher expectations.

01:15:47.100 --> 01:15:49.100
Study after study after
study reveals this.

01:15:49.100 --> 01:15:51.530
Teacher expectation is
the number one factor,

01:15:51.530 --> 01:15:53.360
and we have good
research on why,

01:15:53.360 --> 01:15:55.940
because teacher expectation
creates a Pygmalion effect.

01:15:55.940 --> 01:15:57.860
You are always creating
a Pygmalion effect

01:15:57.860 --> 01:15:58.790
in your classroom.

01:15:58.790 --> 01:16:01.160
That's a fact, always.

01:16:01.160 --> 01:16:03.920
There is always a
Pygmalion effect going on.

01:16:03.920 --> 01:16:07.870
The question is whether it's a
positive or a negative one, OK?

01:16:07.870 --> 01:16:10.720
The negative Pygmalion effect
is you think I'm not smart,

01:16:10.720 --> 01:16:11.840
I must not be smart.

01:16:11.840 --> 01:16:15.360
The positive Pygmalion effect
is you think I'm smart,

01:16:15.360 --> 01:16:18.260
I must be smart.

01:16:18.260 --> 01:16:21.466
And this is what Carol Dweck's
work has lifted up for us.

01:16:21.466 --> 01:16:23.090
Now I'm in schools
all over the country

01:16:23.090 --> 01:16:24.689
that are misusing
Carol Dweck's work.

01:16:24.689 --> 01:16:27.230
Carol Dweck-- how many of you
are familiar with Carol Dweck's

01:16:27.230 --> 01:16:27.750
work?

01:16:27.750 --> 01:16:28.250
Oh, yeah.

01:16:28.250 --> 01:16:29.310
That's what I thought.

01:16:29.310 --> 01:16:30.543
It's all the rage.

01:16:30.543 --> 01:16:32.022
[LAUGHTER]

01:16:33.010 --> 01:16:37.660
Have you been-- checked out
Carol's latest lectures?

01:16:37.660 --> 01:16:43.430
She's gone back on the lecture
circuit to rage on schools

01:16:43.430 --> 01:16:45.906
for misusing her research.

01:16:45.906 --> 01:16:47.780
Because I'm in schools
all the time that say,

01:16:47.780 --> 01:16:49.490
yeah, we're working
on growth mindset.

01:16:49.490 --> 01:16:50.810
I'm like, yeah, oh, who are
you working on that with?

01:16:50.810 --> 01:16:51.380
And they're like, the kids.

01:16:51.380 --> 01:16:52.963
We're developing
kids' growth mindset.

01:16:56.340 --> 01:16:58.242
Carol's like, oh, shit.

01:16:58.242 --> 01:16:59.210
[LAUGHTER]

01:16:59.210 --> 01:17:02.010
OK, let me just lay it
out for you plain, right?

01:17:02.010 --> 01:17:03.300
Who needs a growth mindset?

01:17:03.300 --> 01:17:04.374
AUDIENCE: Teachers.

01:17:04.374 --> 01:17:05.790
JEFF DUNCAN-ANDRADE:
The grownups.

01:17:05.790 --> 01:17:07.560
OK, the grownups.

01:17:07.560 --> 01:17:09.870
What Carol Dweck says very
clearly in her research

01:17:09.870 --> 01:17:12.420
is that the mindset
of the children

01:17:12.420 --> 01:17:15.510
reflects the mindset
of the adults.

01:17:15.510 --> 01:17:17.760
So if you want to change
the mindset of the children,

01:17:17.760 --> 01:17:19.718
you've got to change the
mindset of the adults.

01:17:19.718 --> 01:17:21.730
The growth mindset work
is for the grownups.

01:17:21.730 --> 01:17:23.520
And when grownups
have a growth mindset,

01:17:23.520 --> 01:17:25.065
kids come along just fine.

01:17:25.065 --> 01:17:26.940
So if you're finding
children in your schools

01:17:26.940 --> 01:17:29.820
don't have growth mindset,
then work on the adults that

01:17:29.820 --> 01:17:32.670
are around them.

01:17:32.670 --> 01:17:34.740
We're short on
time, so I'm going

01:17:34.740 --> 01:17:37.540
to blow into the third one.

01:17:37.540 --> 01:17:40.121
You're not going to get
to see the [INAUDIBLE]..

01:17:40.121 --> 01:17:40.620
Sorry.

01:17:40.620 --> 01:17:43.434
Hey, you know-- now she's
giving me the two-minute mark.

01:17:43.434 --> 01:17:44.850
Or are you throwing
up peace sign?

01:17:44.850 --> 01:17:46.705
[LAUGHTER]

01:17:47.205 --> 01:17:51.450
We're going to end
with responsibility.

01:17:51.450 --> 01:17:54.930
Because at the end of the
day, that's the driver.

01:17:54.930 --> 01:17:58.534
Can we hold our responsibility?

01:17:58.534 --> 01:18:00.700
Bruce Perry's considered
the nation's leading expert

01:18:00.700 --> 01:18:03.270
on child trauma.

01:18:03.270 --> 01:18:05.390
So if you are working
with kids that

01:18:05.390 --> 01:18:08.940
are experiencing mild to severe
exposure to toxic stress,

01:18:08.940 --> 01:18:12.410
they are going to have
trauma registers, OK?

01:18:12.410 --> 01:18:15.020
Bruce's book, "The Boy
Who Was Raised as a Dog"

01:18:15.020 --> 01:18:17.450
is my primer when I'm
working with schools that

01:18:17.450 --> 01:18:18.770
have high levels of trauma.

01:18:18.770 --> 01:18:20.510
It is awesome.

01:18:20.510 --> 01:18:22.940
His work is awesome,
and this book

01:18:22.940 --> 01:18:25.496
is a great PD item for teachers.

01:18:25.496 --> 01:18:26.870
You can do one
chapter at a time,

01:18:26.870 --> 01:18:29.720
because every chapter's
an independent case study.

01:18:29.720 --> 01:18:33.080
And it will literally
change the way

01:18:33.080 --> 01:18:37.220
that you interact with kids that
quote, unquote, "misbehave,"

01:18:37.220 --> 01:18:39.179
because you'll read their
behavior differently.

01:18:39.179 --> 01:18:40.803
And when you read
behavior differently,

01:18:40.803 --> 01:18:41.810
you respond differently.

01:18:41.810 --> 01:18:45.770
If you see it as misbehavior,
then you'll punish it.

01:18:45.770 --> 01:18:48.080
If you see it as the
result of trauma,

01:18:48.080 --> 01:18:50.280
then you'll try to heal it.

01:18:50.280 --> 01:18:53.887
There's all kinds of
neurology behind that.

01:18:53.887 --> 01:18:55.470
Some other light
reading, just in case

01:18:55.470 --> 01:18:57.630
you get bored over the summer.

01:18:57.630 --> 01:18:58.890
Robert Putnam.

01:18:58.890 --> 01:19:01.320
Oxford recalls Robert Putnam
the world's most influential

01:19:01.320 --> 01:19:02.890
scholar.

01:19:02.890 --> 01:19:05.370
OK, it's not actually "Bowling
Alone" that I recommend.

01:19:05.370 --> 01:19:07.050
I put "Bowling Alone" up there
because that's the one that

01:19:07.050 --> 01:19:07.841
put him on the map.

01:19:07.841 --> 01:19:10.890
He just released another
book called "Our Kids," which

01:19:10.890 --> 01:19:15.210
is one of the best
political economist analyses

01:19:15.210 --> 01:19:17.910
of the role of public
schools in creating

01:19:17.910 --> 01:19:21.150
a social apartheid or a
pluralistic, multiracial

01:19:21.150 --> 01:19:22.050
democracy.

01:19:22.050 --> 01:19:24.120
Putnam is at Harvard's
Kennedy School.

01:19:24.120 --> 01:19:29.880
He concludes that we are rapidly
approaching social apartheid,

01:19:29.880 --> 01:19:32.530
if not already achieved it.

01:19:32.530 --> 01:19:37.590
"Unnatural Causes" is an
amazing film series from PBS.

01:19:37.590 --> 01:19:40.450
I think they now
have eight films out.

01:19:40.450 --> 01:19:44.010
It has a great website with
tons of resources for teachers.

01:19:44.010 --> 01:19:46.820
It's the largest study ever
connected cross-discipline--

01:19:46.820 --> 01:19:49.590
or ever conducted
cross-disciplinary

01:19:49.590 --> 01:19:51.720
on the impact of inequality.

01:19:51.720 --> 01:19:53.940
It's a global
study of inequality

01:19:53.940 --> 01:19:56.130
and its relationship
to health outcomes.

01:19:56.130 --> 01:20:00.390
And conclusive field to
field is that the biggest

01:20:00.390 --> 01:20:03.760
threat to health on the
planet is inequality.

01:20:03.760 --> 01:20:06.900
So if you want a healthy
classroom or a healthy school,

01:20:06.900 --> 01:20:10.090
you have to eradicate
all forms of inequality.

01:20:10.090 --> 01:20:12.420
No oppression Olympics.

01:20:12.420 --> 01:20:13.969
You've got to pay
attention to race.

01:20:13.969 --> 01:20:15.510
You've got to pay
attention to class.

01:20:15.510 --> 01:20:16.970
You've got to pay
attention to gender.

01:20:16.970 --> 01:20:18.928
You've got to pay attention
to sexual identity.

01:20:18.928 --> 01:20:21.510
You've got to pay attention
to xenophobia, language.

01:20:21.510 --> 01:20:25.920
All forms of inequality,
odious, intolerable.

01:20:25.920 --> 01:20:28.080
And when that is what
we see in schools,

01:20:28.080 --> 01:20:30.710
that's what we'll
see in our society.

01:20:30.710 --> 01:20:33.390
Because if for 13 years
you go to an institution

01:20:33.390 --> 01:20:36.210
where inequality
is unacceptable,

01:20:36.210 --> 01:20:37.680
you become an
adult that believes

01:20:37.680 --> 01:20:39.840
inequality is unacceptable.

01:20:39.840 --> 01:20:42.960
But the truth is schools
are a social mirror,

01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:44.730
and the same
radicalized inequality

01:20:44.730 --> 01:20:49.420
that we see in the society
gets normed in schools.

01:20:49.420 --> 01:20:52.510
And then last, Michelle
Alexander's "The New Jim Crow"

01:20:52.510 --> 01:20:54.520
for my money is
the best analysis

01:20:54.520 --> 01:20:58.280
of the relationship between
schools and the prison system.

01:20:58.280 --> 01:20:59.770
I want every
educator that I work

01:20:59.770 --> 01:21:03.190
with to understand that
writing a referral on a child

01:21:03.190 --> 01:21:05.590
is not a benign act.

01:21:05.590 --> 01:21:10.380
You put pen to paper, and
we have very clear evidence

01:21:10.380 --> 01:21:13.770
that there is a connection
between referral and pathway

01:21:13.770 --> 01:21:15.120
to juvie.

01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:17.070
And we have very clear
research evidence

01:21:17.070 --> 01:21:20.100
that there is a clear connection
between the pathway to juvie

01:21:20.100 --> 01:21:22.260
and the pathway to the pen.

01:21:22.260 --> 01:21:25.620
Schools have to change the
way we discipline kids,

01:21:25.620 --> 01:21:27.050
because we don't.

01:21:27.050 --> 01:21:28.590
We punish them.

01:21:28.590 --> 01:21:31.350
And discipline and punishment
are not the same thing.

01:21:31.350 --> 01:21:34.260
Read Michel Foucault. We
have conflated those things

01:21:34.260 --> 01:21:35.670
in schools.

01:21:35.670 --> 01:21:37.260
And I guarantee
you, if you start

01:21:37.260 --> 01:21:41.790
calling suspension,
expulsion, and office

01:21:41.790 --> 01:21:45.857
referrals punishment,
they'll go down.

01:21:45.857 --> 01:21:47.690
They'll go down, because
then you're saying,

01:21:47.690 --> 01:21:49.890
so you want to punish this kid.

01:21:49.890 --> 01:21:51.117
And people-- oh, no, no, no.

01:21:51.117 --> 01:21:52.200
I want to discipline them.

01:21:52.200 --> 01:21:52.699
OK.

01:21:52.699 --> 01:21:57.150
Well, discipline comes from
the Latin discipulus, which

01:21:57.150 --> 01:21:58.930
means rigorous repetition--

01:21:58.930 --> 01:22:01.350
or rigorous training
through repetition.

01:22:01.350 --> 01:22:05.560
Can you give a child rigorous
training through repetition

01:22:05.560 --> 01:22:07.960
if they're suspended?

01:22:07.960 --> 01:22:08.460
Yeah.

01:22:08.460 --> 01:22:11.250
You can give them rigorous
repetition in suspension,

01:22:11.250 --> 01:22:13.360
and that's what
happens, isn't it?

01:22:13.360 --> 01:22:16.050
There is no evidence
in the research field

01:22:16.050 --> 01:22:18.330
that punishment
changes behavior.

01:22:18.330 --> 01:22:20.730
There is very clear evidence
in the research field

01:22:20.730 --> 01:22:22.380
that discipline
changes behavior.

01:22:22.380 --> 01:22:25.110
Discipline is a
process of inclusion.

01:22:25.110 --> 01:22:27.900
Punishment is a
process of exclusion.

01:22:27.900 --> 01:22:29.924
Do you discipline kids
or do you punish them?

01:22:29.924 --> 01:22:31.590
Make sure you understand
the difference.

01:22:31.590 --> 01:22:36.480
Wayne Yang wrote a great article
on this for educators, Y-A-N-G.

01:22:36.480 --> 01:22:40.140
So I'm going to end giving you
a live look into my classroom,

01:22:40.140 --> 01:22:42.536
just in case you think I'm
up here just talking shit.

01:22:42.536 --> 01:22:44.200
[LAUGHTER]

01:22:44.200 --> 01:22:46.500
Which I mostly am,
but I actually--

01:22:46.500 --> 01:22:47.742
I actually do the work too.

01:22:47.742 --> 01:22:49.200
I've been a teacher
in my community

01:22:49.200 --> 01:22:51.349
for-- this will be my 25th year.

01:22:51.349 --> 01:22:53.640
I hear I get some kind of,
like, tinfoil watch for that

01:22:53.640 --> 01:22:54.139
this year.

01:22:54.139 --> 01:22:55.440
[LAUGHTER]

01:22:56.340 --> 01:23:00.450
So this is from my high
school English classroom

01:23:00.450 --> 01:23:02.140
a few years back.

01:23:02.140 --> 01:23:04.230
This young lady that
you're going to hear from

01:23:04.230 --> 01:23:06.390
is actually my
neighbor, so I literally

01:23:06.390 --> 01:23:08.340
teach my neighbor's kids.

01:23:08.340 --> 01:23:10.830
She's also from the 3400 block.

01:23:10.830 --> 01:23:12.390
This was at Fremont.

01:23:12.390 --> 01:23:14.994
And this is my
second year with her.

01:23:14.994 --> 01:23:16.410
And I want you to
understand that,

01:23:16.410 --> 01:23:18.720
because this stuff that I'm
talking about doesn't happen--

01:23:18.720 --> 01:23:19.261
[FINGER SNAP]

01:23:19.261 --> 01:23:21.066
--like that.

01:23:21.066 --> 01:23:25.010
That your responsibility
is a commitment over time.

01:23:25.010 --> 01:23:26.580
That young people
will not become

01:23:26.580 --> 01:23:29.190
who we want them to be tomorrow
just because we love them

01:23:29.190 --> 01:23:31.800
a little bit harder,
particularly the most

01:23:31.800 --> 01:23:33.650
wounded and vulnerable youth.

01:23:33.650 --> 01:23:35.400
They're going to show
up with their wounds

01:23:35.400 --> 01:23:37.066
and their vulnerability,
and the more we

01:23:37.066 --> 01:23:39.630
love them, the more they're
going to expose that--

01:23:39.630 --> 01:23:41.310
expose that to us,
and the harder it's

01:23:41.310 --> 01:23:43.560
going to be to love them,
because it's painful to love

01:23:43.560 --> 01:23:45.751
somebody who's wounded.

01:23:45.751 --> 01:23:47.750
So we've got to support
each other in that work.

01:23:47.750 --> 01:23:50.540
We can't isolate
teachers either.

01:23:50.540 --> 01:23:52.290
Now I'm also going to
say about this video

01:23:52.290 --> 01:23:54.623
that you're about to see that
it may trigger some of you

01:23:54.623 --> 01:23:56.410
because of what she
chooses to share.

01:23:56.410 --> 01:24:00.010
And if you get triggered, please
take the space that you need.

01:24:00.010 --> 01:24:02.340
And if somebody at your
table gets triggered,

01:24:02.340 --> 01:24:04.650
acknowledge their humanity.

01:24:04.650 --> 01:24:05.970
Check in on them.

01:24:05.970 --> 01:24:08.170
Lay hands, skin to skin.

01:24:08.170 --> 01:24:11.640
It's important.

01:24:11.640 --> 01:24:15.050
When I think about my
responsibility as an educator,

01:24:15.050 --> 01:24:19.101
I think about her, and I
think about this story.

01:24:19.101 --> 01:24:21.089
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

01:24:21.089 --> 01:24:26.556
- My poem is called "More
scars than birthdays."

01:24:26.556 --> 01:24:28.544
"If I had a gun
pointed to my head

01:24:28.544 --> 01:24:30.532
and my life flashed
before my eyes,

01:24:30.532 --> 01:24:34.011
I would see the times I
would smoke with ma cousins,

01:24:34.011 --> 01:24:37.987
drinking, smacking, doing powder
till I knew I was too gone.

01:24:37.987 --> 01:24:40.901
Cheating on my boyfriend with
my ex because he would tell me

01:24:40.901 --> 01:24:41.650
he still loved me.

01:24:41.650 --> 01:24:44.386
Lyin to the people I
love, hurtin the people

01:24:44.386 --> 01:24:46.390
that care about me the most.

01:24:46.390 --> 01:24:49.060
And then I would
see the reason why.

01:24:49.060 --> 01:25:02.008
I would see a little girl--"

01:25:02.008 --> 01:25:03.004
[CRYING]

01:25:03.004 --> 01:25:06.490
- You can do it.

01:25:06.490 --> 01:25:09.146
[CRYING]

01:25:09.146 --> 01:25:09.976
We're with you.

01:25:09.976 --> 01:25:15.454
[CRYING]

01:25:26.410 --> 01:25:28.402
- "I would see a
little girl getting

01:25:28.402 --> 01:25:31.390
raped at the age
of four years old.

01:25:31.390 --> 01:25:35.292
She didn't know what to
do or who to talk to.

01:25:35.292 --> 01:25:39.244
She was so afraid that she
would cry and not tell anybody.

01:25:39.244 --> 01:25:41.220
She stayed silent.

01:25:41.220 --> 01:25:47.207
I would see four years passing
by, rape after rape after rape.

01:25:52.564 --> 01:25:56.120
I would see an
eight-year-old girl

01:25:56.120 --> 01:25:58.418
with more scars than birthdays.

01:25:58.418 --> 01:26:00.870
I would see a girl--

01:26:00.870 --> 01:26:01.370
no.

01:26:01.370 --> 01:26:04.620
I would see a 13-year-old
girl getting raped

01:26:04.620 --> 01:26:06.461
by her first real boyfriend.

01:26:06.461 --> 01:26:10.165
I would see a girl who didn't
know how to love herself.

01:26:10.165 --> 01:26:13.065
I would see me.

01:26:13.065 --> 01:26:16.035
And if I had a gun
pointed to my head,

01:26:16.035 --> 01:26:20.598
and I had minutes left to live,
I would tell that little girl,

01:26:20.598 --> 01:26:22.117
it's OK to tell your mom.

01:26:22.117 --> 01:26:26.770
It's safe to cry, go through
your pain so you can heal.

01:26:26.770 --> 01:26:30.332
Drugs will not heal your
pain, will not block it out.

01:26:30.332 --> 01:26:31.304
Love yourself.

01:26:31.304 --> 01:26:38.594
One day: trust
somebody, love somebody,

01:26:38.594 --> 01:26:40.538
let yourself be loved.

01:26:40.538 --> 01:26:43.460
If I had a gun
pointed at my head,

01:26:43.460 --> 01:26:47.612
I would cry and tell
15-year-old me 'I love you,

01:26:47.612 --> 01:26:49.568
don't regret your mistakes.'

01:26:49.568 --> 01:26:52.013
Because I've learned that
my mistakes are the lessons

01:26:52.013 --> 01:26:54.947
I needed to learn so I could
create a better future."

01:26:54.947 --> 01:26:59.837
[APPLAUSE]

01:26:59.837 --> 01:27:02.310
[END PLAYBACK]

01:27:02.310 --> 01:27:06.310
That girl's in your class.

01:27:06.310 --> 01:27:09.540
That girl's in your school.

01:27:09.540 --> 01:27:12.310
That boy's in your class.

01:27:12.310 --> 01:27:14.770
That boy's in your school.

01:27:14.770 --> 01:27:17.112
That is not the question.

01:27:17.112 --> 01:27:21.660
The question is whether or not
your school and your classroom

01:27:21.660 --> 01:27:29.280
creates the space for them to
narrate that truth and be held.

01:27:29.280 --> 01:27:30.420
She's 16 years old.

01:27:30.420 --> 01:27:31.710
She's a sophomore.

01:27:31.710 --> 01:27:36.220
She's standing in front
of her peers saying that.

01:27:36.220 --> 01:27:40.486
How do we create
classroom youth cultures

01:27:40.486 --> 01:27:41.860
where they hold
each other, where

01:27:41.860 --> 01:27:46.230
that doesn't become chisme, that
doesn't become cyberbullying?

01:27:46.230 --> 01:27:49.020
That's not all over
the bathroom walls.

01:27:49.020 --> 01:27:51.060
But instead, they're
calling out, say, go.

01:27:51.060 --> 01:27:51.880
We got you.

01:27:51.880 --> 01:27:52.545
It's OK.

01:27:52.545 --> 01:27:54.912
We got you.

01:27:54.912 --> 01:27:56.120
And they're saying, go ahead.

01:27:56.120 --> 01:27:59.610
We got you, because they
know they're up next.

01:27:59.610 --> 01:28:02.640
They're going to be up
there telling their story.

01:28:02.640 --> 01:28:04.490
And their story looks
just like her story.

01:28:07.060 --> 01:28:08.610
When young people
are doing that,

01:28:08.610 --> 01:28:10.860
they're a lot less likely
to sit on a trigger

01:28:10.860 --> 01:28:13.740
and point it at somebody
that looks just like them.

01:28:13.740 --> 01:28:16.230
The only way you
can pick up a heater

01:28:16.230 --> 01:28:18.630
and pointed at somebody
that looks just like you

01:28:18.630 --> 01:28:20.870
is if you hate yourself.

01:28:20.870 --> 01:28:23.090
You want to stop violence
in your neighborhoods,

01:28:23.090 --> 01:28:28.280
you want to stop rape, you want
to stop pillaging, violence,

01:28:28.280 --> 01:28:32.900
suffering, center love.

01:28:32.900 --> 01:28:35.600
Create the conditions
in your school

01:28:35.600 --> 01:28:39.290
where children are able to
heal from their woundedness

01:28:39.290 --> 01:28:42.740
and learn to love
themselves by loving others.

01:28:42.740 --> 01:28:47.780
That will transform this
nation state from 103

01:28:47.780 --> 01:28:50.030
to top 20 in peacefulness.

01:28:50.030 --> 01:28:53.880
What we do every day
around love matters.

01:28:53.880 --> 01:28:59.350
I don't give a shit
about your test scores

01:28:59.350 --> 01:29:02.020
if your students
leave your institution

01:29:02.020 --> 01:29:05.230
and they don't love themselves.

01:29:05.230 --> 01:29:09.230
We're building a nation full
of educated [INAUDIBLE]..

01:29:09.230 --> 01:29:12.260
The creators of the collapse
of the housing industry

01:29:12.260 --> 01:29:14.570
and the banking
industry all went

01:29:14.570 --> 01:29:18.950
to the most elite
universities in the world.

01:29:18.950 --> 01:29:20.780
That can't be the solution.

01:29:20.780 --> 01:29:24.440
We must be missing
something in what we're

01:29:24.440 --> 01:29:28.100
centering if they can read
and write and do math and then

01:29:28.100 --> 01:29:32.980
create paradigms whereby
they exploit other people.

01:29:32.980 --> 01:29:36.480
We've got to put ourselves
on the hook for that.

01:29:36.480 --> 01:29:39.060
How are we going to create
a group of young people

01:29:39.060 --> 01:29:41.370
that will build the nation
that we've rhetorically

01:29:41.370 --> 01:29:45.424
committed to, but in reality
have not built at all?

01:29:45.424 --> 01:29:50.010
I'll end with the teachings
of the people of this land,

01:29:50.010 --> 01:29:52.110
teachings from the
Cherokee community,

01:29:52.110 --> 01:29:54.750
which also reoccur
across many indigenous

01:29:54.750 --> 01:29:57.090
communities, this story.

01:29:57.090 --> 01:30:01.365
It's a story about little
boy out in the front yard

01:30:01.365 --> 01:30:01.990
playing around.

01:30:01.990 --> 01:30:03.865
He comes running in the
house, and he runs up

01:30:03.865 --> 01:30:05.330
to his Abuelita, his grandma.

01:30:05.330 --> 01:30:07.290
He says, Abuelita,
I feel like there's

01:30:07.290 --> 01:30:10.130
a war going on inside my head.

01:30:10.130 --> 01:30:13.080
And she says, there is, mijo.

01:30:13.080 --> 01:30:15.810
He says, who's
fighting, Abuelita?

01:30:15.810 --> 01:30:17.876
She says, the two wolves.

01:30:17.876 --> 01:30:20.780
He says, well, who are
the two wolves, Abuelita?

01:30:20.780 --> 01:30:27.660
And she says, one wolf is rage,
avarice, greed, selfishness,

01:30:27.660 --> 01:30:29.650
violence.

01:30:29.650 --> 01:30:32.400
He says, who's the
other wolf, Abuelita?

01:30:32.400 --> 01:30:41.400
She says, the other wolf is
garino, familia, love, empathy.

01:30:41.400 --> 01:30:43.942
He says, who wins, Abuelita?

01:30:43.942 --> 01:30:48.140
And she says, the one you feed.

01:30:48.140 --> 01:30:51.750
Those wolves are inside
every child you serve.

01:30:51.750 --> 01:30:54.750
They're inside every
person in this room.

01:30:54.750 --> 01:30:57.860
They're inside every staff
member you work with.

01:30:57.860 --> 01:30:59.836
They're there.

01:30:59.836 --> 01:31:03.570
If we can change the wolves
we're feeding in ourselves,

01:31:03.570 --> 01:31:06.950
we will change the wolves
the young people are feeding.

01:31:06.950 --> 01:31:09.810
And when we do that, we're
on the path of the thing

01:31:09.810 --> 01:31:12.180
that I think almost everybody
in this room set out

01:31:12.180 --> 01:31:14.250
to try to build when
you were dumb enough

01:31:14.250 --> 01:31:15.240
to become an educator.

01:31:15.240 --> 01:31:17.260
[LAUGHTER]

01:31:17.260 --> 01:31:21.150
If I can support you in
any way on that journey,

01:31:21.150 --> 01:31:23.260
please don't hesitate
to reach out.

01:31:23.260 --> 01:31:27.330
Put my contact info back up.

01:31:27.330 --> 01:31:31.110
If you want this slide deck, if
you want any of the resources,

01:31:31.110 --> 01:31:32.970
if you want the second
tier of resources

01:31:32.970 --> 01:31:35.730
that come after you've
read all this stuff, please

01:31:35.730 --> 01:31:37.200
don't hesitate to reach out.

01:31:37.200 --> 01:31:40.830
We will not build this
transformation in isolation.

01:31:40.830 --> 01:31:44.040
This has to be both an
individual and a collective

01:31:44.040 --> 01:31:46.410
and a national commitment
to change in the way

01:31:46.410 --> 01:31:48.850
that we do education
in this country.

01:31:48.850 --> 01:31:49.599
Thank you.

01:31:49.599 --> 01:31:55.467
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]

01:31:57.912 --> 01:31:59.379
SPEAKER 1: All right.

01:31:59.379 --> 01:32:01.400
So Jeff has been nice
enough to offer to answer

01:32:01.400 --> 01:32:02.270
a few of your questions.

01:32:02.270 --> 01:32:03.645
So we'll take
another few minutes

01:32:03.645 --> 01:32:06.140
and give you all an opportunity.

01:32:06.140 --> 01:32:10.060
I can bring this around.

01:32:10.060 --> 01:32:12.126
JEFF DUNCAN-ANDRADE:
Yeah, in the back?

01:32:12.126 --> 01:32:15.210
AUDIENCE: Thank you for
coming here and talking today,

01:32:15.210 --> 01:32:15.928
first of all.

01:32:19.070 --> 01:32:20.720
One of the things
we always get asked

01:32:20.720 --> 01:32:22.970
is, what are some of
the practical things

01:32:22.970 --> 01:32:25.240
we can bring back?

01:32:25.240 --> 01:32:27.740
Even though it's a
long journey, but just

01:32:27.740 --> 01:32:30.300
to start the ball
rolling with some things

01:32:30.300 --> 01:32:33.500
that teachers can grab on to.

01:32:33.500 --> 01:32:39.170
Similarly to the hope survey
that you mentioned, something

01:32:39.170 --> 01:32:40.880
along those lines,
and where to go

01:32:40.880 --> 01:32:43.747
to get some of those resources.

01:32:43.747 --> 01:32:44.830
JEFF DUNCAN-ANDRADE: Yeah.

01:32:44.830 --> 01:32:45.910
AUDIENCE: Or exercises.

01:32:45.910 --> 01:32:47.451
JEFF DUNCAN-ANDRADE:
So the resources

01:32:47.451 --> 01:32:50.060
that I lifted up
in this talk, when

01:32:50.060 --> 01:32:52.940
I read these texts, they
immediately resonated

01:32:52.940 --> 01:32:54.580
for me in my classroom.

01:32:54.580 --> 01:32:57.410
Like, I could
apply it right now.

01:32:57.410 --> 01:32:58.200
Like, oh.

01:32:58.200 --> 01:33:00.530
It changed the way
I saw certain kids.

01:33:00.530 --> 01:33:03.815
So it really depends on
the problem of practice

01:33:03.815 --> 01:33:06.860
that the educator
is trying to unlock.

01:33:06.860 --> 01:33:10.190
But typically, that's
with, like, I'm

01:33:10.190 --> 01:33:12.230
trying to figure out how
to connect to this kid

01:33:12.230 --> 01:33:14.660
that I can't figure out
how to connect to, right?

01:33:14.660 --> 01:33:16.349
That's typically the
biggest challenge

01:33:16.349 --> 01:33:17.390
that I see with teachers.

01:33:17.390 --> 01:33:21.230
This kid is disruptive, won't
do the work, they're defiant,

01:33:21.230 --> 01:33:24.050
whatever the story is.

01:33:24.050 --> 01:33:28.010
And so depending on the
context in which you teach,

01:33:28.010 --> 01:33:31.720
I would start teachers off
either with Perry's book,

01:33:31.720 --> 01:33:35.180
OK, Bruce Perry's book, "The
Boy That Was Raised as a Dog,"

01:33:35.180 --> 01:33:37.700
because inevitably what's
happening with that quote,

01:33:37.700 --> 01:33:41.630
unquote, "defiant" kid is that
they're carrying a trauma load,

01:33:41.630 --> 01:33:42.690
right?

01:33:42.690 --> 01:33:45.110
Their neurology and
their biochemistry's

01:33:45.110 --> 01:33:49.850
all off whack because they're
not feeling safe, right?

01:33:49.850 --> 01:33:53.210
And so to the degree that a
teacher can understand that--

01:33:53.210 --> 01:33:55.070
and Perry helps you
understand, like,

01:33:55.070 --> 01:33:57.009
what's going on inside the kid.

01:33:57.009 --> 01:33:59.300
And when you understand what's
going on inside the kid,

01:33:59.300 --> 01:34:02.510
then you read the outer
portrayal of those things

01:34:02.510 --> 01:34:04.490
differently.

01:34:04.490 --> 01:34:08.420
So the other thing that
really impacted my classroom

01:34:08.420 --> 01:34:12.782
practice a lot was "Unnatural
Causes," that film series.

01:34:12.782 --> 01:34:14.240
Because there's
also a website that

01:34:14.240 --> 01:34:18.320
hosts it that has lots and lots
of very practical curriculum

01:34:18.320 --> 01:34:21.650
resources, trainings, all
these things that teachers

01:34:21.650 --> 01:34:23.030
can access.

01:34:23.030 --> 01:34:26.000
But at the end of the day, I
think typically the advice that

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:29.360
I give to teachers that are
struggling with a particular

01:34:29.360 --> 01:34:34.400
student is don't try to fix
that problem in the classroom,

01:34:34.400 --> 01:34:37.380
because you almost
certainly can't.

01:34:37.380 --> 01:34:42.020
So can you create the conditions
to build a relationship

01:34:42.020 --> 01:34:45.380
with that child outside
of the classroom?

01:34:45.380 --> 01:34:48.920
And the truth is that
every single teacher

01:34:48.920 --> 01:34:54.070
I've ever worked with already
has the skill set they need.

01:34:54.070 --> 01:34:55.470
They're not lacking, OK?

01:34:55.470 --> 01:34:57.090
Because every teacher
that you might

01:34:57.090 --> 01:35:00.120
be working with that's
struggling with something,

01:35:00.120 --> 01:35:04.430
they have a good relationship
with somebody in their life.

01:35:04.430 --> 01:35:07.470
So what is that evidence of?

01:35:07.470 --> 01:35:08.470
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:35:08.470 --> 01:35:09.070
JEFF DUNCAN-ANDRADE:
That they know

01:35:09.070 --> 01:35:11.260
how to build a good
relationship, right?

01:35:11.260 --> 01:35:14.710
And so what's happening
is that they're

01:35:14.710 --> 01:35:19.030
mismatching who they are in
that positive relationship

01:35:19.030 --> 01:35:23.670
and who they are with that kid
that they're in conflict with.

01:35:23.670 --> 01:35:26.050
And because they have
power in the relationship,

01:35:26.050 --> 01:35:28.840
they're wanting the kid
to change first, right?

01:35:28.840 --> 01:35:31.660
When this kid shows
up properly, right?

01:35:31.660 --> 01:35:35.320
When they show up with respect,
then I'll be their teacher.

01:35:35.320 --> 01:35:39.040
That's actually a violation
of our moral responsibility

01:35:39.040 --> 01:35:40.030
as a teacher.

01:35:40.030 --> 01:35:41.590
In New Zealand,
they actually have

01:35:41.590 --> 01:35:45.256
to sign-- teachers have to
sign the Hippocratic oath.

01:35:45.256 --> 01:35:46.630
Y'all know what
the Hippocratic--

01:35:46.630 --> 01:35:48.546
anybody not know what
the Hippocratic oath is?

01:35:48.546 --> 01:35:50.020
That's the oath
that doctors take.

01:35:50.020 --> 01:35:52.020
And what's the
main line in there?

01:35:52.020 --> 01:35:53.320
AUDIENCE: Do no harm.

01:35:53.320 --> 01:35:56.740
JEFF DUNCAN-ANDRADE: First
rule, do no harm, right?

01:35:56.740 --> 01:36:00.070
And so I start there
with teachers, right?

01:36:00.070 --> 01:36:04.681
What is-- have them analyze
the best relationship

01:36:04.681 --> 01:36:05.680
they have in their life.

01:36:05.680 --> 01:36:07.000
What are the components of it?

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:08.110
How do they act?

01:36:08.110 --> 01:36:12.400
And specifically, how do
you act under conflict?

01:36:12.400 --> 01:36:17.440
Because we romanticize our
relationships in this country.

01:36:17.440 --> 01:36:20.860
We act as if conflict
is a bad thing.

01:36:20.860 --> 01:36:23.510
And the truth is that the
tightest relationship you have,

01:36:23.510 --> 01:36:25.960
whether it's with your
homies or with your partner

01:36:25.960 --> 01:36:30.730
or with your children,
there's always conflict.

01:36:33.410 --> 01:36:37.430
And we have this story that
we tell ourselves that love

01:36:37.430 --> 01:36:40.640
is the absence of conflict.

01:36:40.640 --> 01:36:43.940
Because love in this society
is super pollyannish.

01:36:43.940 --> 01:36:45.735
It's all based on
"The Notebook."

01:36:45.735 --> 01:36:47.890
[LAUGHTER]

01:36:48.660 --> 01:36:50.870
Everything's going to
be OK in the end, right?

01:36:50.870 --> 01:36:53.260
No, it's not.

01:36:53.260 --> 01:36:56.290
Love is not the absence
of conflict, OK?

01:36:56.290 --> 01:36:57.820
Give this nugget
to your teachers.

01:36:57.820 --> 01:36:59.740
Love is not the
absence of conflict.

01:36:59.740 --> 01:37:02.620
Love is the presence of conflict
with the courage, character,

01:37:02.620 --> 01:37:05.500
and commitment to
find your way through.

01:37:05.500 --> 01:37:09.040
And that is the
main divide I find

01:37:09.040 --> 01:37:11.290
between the most successful
teachers and the least

01:37:11.290 --> 01:37:15.970
successful teachers, is the
least successful teachers abhor

01:37:15.970 --> 01:37:17.320
conflict.

01:37:17.320 --> 01:37:19.750
They resent it.

01:37:19.750 --> 01:37:23.430
They want it to go away.

01:37:23.430 --> 01:37:24.870
They want no mess.

01:37:24.870 --> 01:37:28.492
And what I tell those teachers
is, get an office job.

01:37:28.492 --> 01:37:33.300
If you want predictability,
get the hell out of teaching.

01:37:33.300 --> 01:37:37.380
I've been teaching 25
years, and the minute

01:37:37.380 --> 01:37:41.910
I think I got it licked, I get
one in the back of the head.

01:37:41.910 --> 01:37:43.050
Like, no way!

01:37:43.050 --> 01:37:45.000
How'd you get me?

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:50.250
That girl that you heard,
when she started my class,

01:37:50.250 --> 01:37:51.680
I was starting my 18th year.

01:37:51.680 --> 01:37:55.040
I had all these awards.

01:37:55.040 --> 01:37:58.940
And she's my neighbor.

01:37:58.940 --> 01:38:02.270
And one of my points of
pride in my 18 years--

01:38:02.270 --> 01:38:03.671
pride cometh before the--

01:38:03.671 --> 01:38:04.296
AUDIENCE: Fall.

01:38:04.296 --> 01:38:05.005
JEFF DUNCAN-ANDRADE: Mm-hmm.

01:38:05.005 --> 01:38:05.960
So here it comes.

01:38:05.960 --> 01:38:09.590
One of my points of pride was
that in 18 years in deep East

01:38:09.590 --> 01:38:15.248
Oakland, I'd never had a
fight in my class, ever.

01:38:15.248 --> 01:38:21.010
And the first day, that girl
hops off a fight in my class.

01:38:21.010 --> 01:38:22.660
My damn neighbor--

01:38:22.660 --> 01:38:23.830
[LAUGHTER]

01:38:23.830 --> 01:38:27.460
--breaks my streak of 18 years.

01:38:27.460 --> 01:38:31.580
And a lot of teachers would
have resented her for that,

01:38:31.580 --> 01:38:35.920
and I loved her for it,
because she forced me to grow.

01:38:35.920 --> 01:38:37.480
And all those awards--

01:38:37.480 --> 01:38:41.110
when I get awards,
I put them in boxes,

01:38:41.110 --> 01:38:42.550
because that's who I was.

01:38:42.550 --> 01:38:45.024
It's not who I'm becoming.

01:38:45.024 --> 01:38:46.190
And she reminded me of that.

01:38:46.190 --> 01:38:48.065
You've got to become
somebody else right now,

01:38:48.065 --> 01:38:50.320
because I'm in your class.

01:38:50.320 --> 01:38:51.800
Right?

01:38:51.800 --> 01:38:54.200
And a lot of teachers,
they'd have all awards,

01:38:54.200 --> 01:38:56.600
do you know who I am?

01:38:56.600 --> 01:39:01.480
That same class two years
later, Harvard brought me up,

01:39:01.480 --> 01:39:04.670
and me and Arne Duncan
were the keynote speakers.

01:39:04.670 --> 01:39:06.170
Arne Duncan went
first, and then I

01:39:06.170 --> 01:39:08.461
went on and explained why
everything he said was wrong.

01:39:08.461 --> 01:39:10.610
[LAUGHTER]

01:39:11.210 --> 01:39:14.450
And so I fly back from Boston.

01:39:14.450 --> 01:39:18.170
I get in, like, 2:00
in the morning to SFO.

01:39:18.170 --> 01:39:21.320
Go back to my house,
and first period I'm

01:39:21.320 --> 01:39:25.190
in my class teaching
11th grade English.

01:39:25.190 --> 01:39:30.080
And this boy in my class,
like, just gives me the--

01:39:30.080 --> 01:39:31.580
like, to the point
where I literally

01:39:31.580 --> 01:39:33.450
started having homicidal
thoughts about him.

01:39:33.450 --> 01:39:34.283
Like, in the moment.

01:39:34.283 --> 01:39:36.340
Like, dude, I'm
going to kill you.

01:39:36.340 --> 01:39:38.600
And my first reaction to
him when he was doing this

01:39:38.600 --> 01:39:40.059
was, I almost--

01:39:40.059 --> 01:39:40.850
I almost said this.

01:39:40.850 --> 01:39:42.770
I almost said, do
you know who I am?

01:39:42.770 --> 01:39:43.994
[LAUGHTER]

01:39:43.994 --> 01:39:46.970
Like, I was just with
Arne Duncan, you asshole.

01:39:46.970 --> 01:39:51.200
[LAUGHTER]

01:39:51.200 --> 01:39:54.680
And then I remember,
he doesn't give a shit

01:39:54.680 --> 01:39:57.020
about Harvard or Arne Duncan.

01:39:57.020 --> 01:39:59.990
He's showing up with
all his woundedness.

01:39:59.990 --> 01:40:03.660
Can you hold me like this?

01:40:03.660 --> 01:40:06.760
Because you say
you care about me.

01:40:06.760 --> 01:40:08.660
And what I try to get
teachers to understand

01:40:08.660 --> 01:40:13.160
is the most wounded children
speak the most truth,

01:40:13.160 --> 01:40:16.100
and we resent them for it.

01:40:16.100 --> 01:40:18.020
Because the most
wounded children

01:40:18.020 --> 01:40:20.460
don't even try to
cover it up anymore.

01:40:20.460 --> 01:40:24.960
They reveal to us the darkest
corners of our society.

01:40:24.960 --> 01:40:28.640
That's what that girl told
you, that she showed me

01:40:28.640 --> 01:40:29.850
on the first day.

01:40:29.850 --> 01:40:31.490
I'm wounded.

01:40:31.490 --> 01:40:34.520
And I know who you think you
are, 18-year vet with all

01:40:34.520 --> 01:40:35.054
your awards.

01:40:35.054 --> 01:40:37.220
Your reputation ripples
throughout the neighborhood.

01:40:37.220 --> 01:40:39.200
And for that reason,
I'm coming in here.

01:40:39.200 --> 01:40:41.420
I'm going to fuck up your
class on the first day.

01:40:41.420 --> 01:40:43.340
[LAUGHTER]

01:40:43.340 --> 01:40:46.430
Because everybody
says, you're Jeff.

01:40:46.430 --> 01:40:48.890
Everybody says, you
love all your students.

01:40:48.890 --> 01:40:51.080
Everybody says,
you'll go to juvie.

01:40:51.080 --> 01:40:52.100
You'll go to jail.

01:40:52.100 --> 01:40:53.330
You'll go to the streets.

01:40:53.330 --> 01:40:56.449
Everybody says, but you
won't do that for me.

01:40:56.449 --> 01:40:57.490
You won't do that for me.

01:40:57.490 --> 01:41:00.031
I know you won't, and I'm going
to prove it on the first day.

01:41:00.031 --> 01:41:05.120
I'm just going to fire on this
girl right here just to see.

01:41:05.120 --> 01:41:10.705
And once we got the fight
stopped, and she's waiting--

01:41:10.705 --> 01:41:11.831
and what's she waiting for?

01:41:11.831 --> 01:41:12.705
AUDIENCE: Punishment.

01:41:12.705 --> 01:41:13.600
AUDIENCE: Reaction.

01:41:13.600 --> 01:41:15.891
JEFF DUNCAN-ANDRADE: She's
waiting to go to the office.

01:41:15.891 --> 01:41:17.740
She's waiting for the referral.

01:41:17.740 --> 01:41:21.240
And I said, sit your ass down.

01:41:21.240 --> 01:41:23.050
Fuck up my 18 years.

01:41:23.050 --> 01:41:25.375
[LAUGHTER]

01:41:25.375 --> 01:41:26.630
Sit your ass down.

01:41:29.150 --> 01:41:31.025
And you know what
her reaction was?

01:41:31.025 --> 01:41:32.750
She literally says, no.

01:41:32.750 --> 01:41:35.480
You have to send
me to the office.

01:41:35.480 --> 01:41:38.930
And I said, I don't send
people to the office.

01:41:38.930 --> 01:41:41.455
Because when I was your age,
I got sent to the office.

01:41:44.240 --> 01:41:49.610
You're here because I love
you, and you did some shit

01:41:49.610 --> 01:41:50.930
that makes me want to kill you.

01:41:50.930 --> 01:41:52.980
[LAUGHTER]

01:41:52.980 --> 01:41:56.880
And so we're going to have
to go from kill to love.

01:41:56.880 --> 01:42:00.560
And in order for that to
happen, we're going to talk.

01:42:00.560 --> 01:42:02.820
No, you've got to
send me to the office.

01:42:02.820 --> 01:42:05.600
No, I don't.

01:42:05.600 --> 01:42:08.420
That's how our
relationship started.

01:42:08.420 --> 01:42:11.210
And a year later, she's
telling that story.

01:42:14.680 --> 01:42:18.070
Now I know how practical that
is, because this work ain't

01:42:18.070 --> 01:42:19.360
always practical, right?

01:42:19.360 --> 01:42:20.085
It's not clean.

01:42:20.085 --> 01:42:20.960
It's not [INAUDIBLE].

01:42:20.960 --> 01:42:24.220
Can you coach
people into the mess

01:42:24.220 --> 01:42:26.680
and then create the conditions
whereby they can narrate,

01:42:26.680 --> 01:42:29.020
how do I get out of this mess?

01:42:29.020 --> 01:42:30.530
Perry can give you
some good stuff.

01:42:30.530 --> 01:42:32.530
"Unnatural Causes" can
give you some good stuff.

01:42:32.530 --> 01:42:34.238
But at the end of the
day, what I find is

01:42:34.238 --> 01:42:36.880
most teachers already know
what they're supposed to do.

01:42:36.880 --> 01:42:40.250
They're just loath to
do it, because they

01:42:40.250 --> 01:42:43.460
haven't figured out how to
find themselves in that child.

01:42:43.460 --> 01:42:45.230
So the practical
piece I will give you

01:42:45.230 --> 01:42:47.430
is actually from my ancestors.

01:42:47.430 --> 01:42:49.820
So I come from the
[INAUDIBLE],, which

01:42:49.820 --> 01:42:53.300
connects me to the Mayan
and the [INAUDIBLE] people.

01:42:53.300 --> 01:42:58.250
And the Mayans had a story, a
principle called In Lak'ech.

01:42:58.250 --> 01:43:02.570
And In Lak'ech became an
increasingly popularized

01:43:02.570 --> 01:43:05.690
concept and term in education
because of the work of the Raza

01:43:05.690 --> 01:43:08.930
Studies program in Tucson
Unified who taught me a lot

01:43:08.930 --> 01:43:12.500
about my history and my
culture and In Lak'ech.

01:43:12.500 --> 01:43:17.120
And In Lak'ech the story
of the smoking mirror.

01:43:17.120 --> 01:43:20.330
We would teach all our
children this idea.

01:43:20.330 --> 01:43:22.990
And the idea is
that every living

01:43:22.990 --> 01:43:26.830
being that you come across
is a smoking mirror.

01:43:26.830 --> 01:43:28.334
That is not the question.

01:43:28.334 --> 01:43:29.750
The question is
whether or not you

01:43:29.750 --> 01:43:31.791
can muster the courage,
character, and commitment

01:43:31.791 --> 01:43:33.140
to clear the smoke away.

01:43:33.140 --> 01:43:35.990
Because if you do,
what will you see?

01:43:35.990 --> 01:43:37.490
You'll see yourself.

01:43:37.490 --> 01:43:40.070
That's the barrier
for most teachers.

01:43:40.070 --> 01:43:42.110
Lisa Delpit called it
in one of her books,

01:43:42.110 --> 01:43:43.992
"Other People's Children."

01:43:43.992 --> 01:43:45.950
And as long as they're
other people's children,

01:43:45.950 --> 01:43:47.039
they go to the office.

01:43:47.039 --> 01:43:48.830
As long as they're
other people's children,

01:43:48.830 --> 01:43:49.538
they go to juvie.

01:43:49.538 --> 01:43:50.480
They need tough love.

01:43:50.480 --> 01:43:52.180
They need discipline.

01:43:52.180 --> 01:43:53.900
They need punishment.

01:43:53.900 --> 01:43:56.930
But if it's your son,
if it's your daughter,

01:43:56.930 --> 01:43:57.980
the smoke is cleared.

01:43:57.980 --> 01:43:58.520
You know.

01:43:58.520 --> 01:44:02.300
You'll try every angle, every--
you ain't going to the office.

01:44:02.300 --> 01:44:06.060
There is no way in hell I'm
sending Amaru or Taiyari

01:44:06.060 --> 01:44:08.354
to the damn principal.

01:44:08.354 --> 01:44:09.020
They're my sons.

01:44:11.750 --> 01:44:14.240
I feel that way about
every kid I teach.

01:44:14.240 --> 01:44:15.740
You are my son.

01:44:15.740 --> 01:44:17.900
You are my daughter.

01:44:17.900 --> 01:44:20.450
I am not sending
you to somebody else

01:44:20.450 --> 01:44:23.270
to fix you, because
you're not broken.

01:44:23.270 --> 01:44:25.220
I have to figure out
what's in your way.

01:44:25.220 --> 01:44:28.620
That is the principle teaching
of all of our ancestors,

01:44:28.620 --> 01:44:30.620
and we've lost our way
around that because we've

01:44:30.620 --> 01:44:34.380
been become technocratic
and mechanical in teaching.

01:44:34.380 --> 01:44:36.980
Teaching is about
relationships, and relationships

01:44:36.980 --> 01:44:40.059
is about work and pain.

01:44:40.059 --> 01:44:41.600
And the deepest
relationships we have

01:44:41.600 --> 01:44:44.270
are with people that we
went through that pain.

01:44:44.270 --> 01:44:45.760
We cleared the smoke away.

01:44:45.760 --> 01:44:48.500
And the honest truth
is that the kids that

01:44:48.500 --> 01:44:51.170
are going to be the
toughest to reach

01:44:51.170 --> 01:44:54.850
are the ones with
the most smoke.

01:44:54.850 --> 01:44:57.220
And that makes sense,
because they're on fire.

01:44:57.220 --> 01:44:58.960
Their lives are on fire.

01:44:58.960 --> 01:45:01.240
So it's going to be way
more smoke to clear.

01:45:01.240 --> 01:45:05.285
Harder work to find
yourself in that child.

01:45:05.285 --> 01:45:06.910
But if you've taught
as long as I have,

01:45:06.910 --> 01:45:11.470
you know that those are
the kids that come back.

01:45:11.470 --> 01:45:13.510
They're worth it.

01:45:13.510 --> 01:45:17.260
But that's what we've got to
get teachers to understand.

01:45:17.260 --> 01:45:20.260
And a lot of times, it's about
getting early wins, right?

01:45:20.260 --> 01:45:22.770
Don't start with the kid
that's a house of fire.

01:45:22.770 --> 01:45:23.650
[LAUGHTER]

01:45:23.650 --> 01:45:25.090
Start with the kid [INAUDIBLE]
a little bit of smoke.

01:45:25.090 --> 01:45:26.050
Get an early win.

01:45:26.050 --> 01:45:27.250
Start getting some momentum.

01:45:27.250 --> 01:45:29.650
Get your confidence up that you
know how to build relationships

01:45:29.650 --> 01:45:31.150
with these young
people, and then we

01:45:31.150 --> 01:45:34.193
can build up to the kid
that's in full-on flames.

01:45:38.130 --> 01:45:38.901
You dig?

01:45:38.901 --> 01:45:40.224
[LAUGHTER]

01:45:41.110 --> 01:45:41.833
Cool.

01:45:41.833 --> 01:45:44.300
SPEAKER 1: Unfortunately, we
have now hit the end of our--

01:45:44.300 --> 01:45:44.800
JEFF DUNCAN-ANDRADE:
Ha ha, that's

01:45:44.800 --> 01:45:45.930
what happens when you
ask me a question.

01:45:45.930 --> 01:45:46.830
[LAUGHTER]

01:45:46.830 --> 01:45:50.780
[APPLAUSE]
