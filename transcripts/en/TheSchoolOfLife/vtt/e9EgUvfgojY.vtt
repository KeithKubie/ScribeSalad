00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:06.110
There is a certain sort of relationship that
is alternately passionate, fiery and painfully

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:11.990
unfulfilling – and that tends to puzzle
both outsiders and its participants; a relationship

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:17.710
between one person who is, as psychologists
put it, anxiously attached and another who

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:25.180
is avoidantly attached. There is, in such
couplings, a constant game of push and pull.

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:30.099
The anxiously attached party typically complains
– more or less loudly – that their partner

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:35.829
is not responsive enough: they accuse them
of being emotionally distant, withholding,

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:41.950
cold and perhaps physically uninterested too.
The avoidant lover, for their part, stays

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:46.780
relatively quiet but in their more fed-up
moments, complains that the anxious party

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:53.360
is far too demanding, possibly ‘mad’ and,
as they put it pejoratively, ‘needy’.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.930
One person seems to want far too much, the
other far too little. Image result for william

eggleston The unhappiness unfolds in a cycle.
At the start, the anxious partner loves the

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:09.400
avoidant one with great intensity – but,
in time, also growing frustration. The dissatisfaction

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:15.730
grows ever more intense until, eventually
one day, fed up with so much seeming rejection,

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:20.460
the anxious partner overcomes their fears,
decides they need something better and tells

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:27.250
their lover that they’re off. At which point,
the avoidant party undergoes a complete seachange.

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:33.450
Their greatest fear, that of being engulfed
in love, disappears at a stroke and reveals

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:39.290
something that is normally utterly submerged
in their character: a fear of being abandoned.

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:43.190
Wholly liberated from the threat of being
engulfed (the anxious one may by now have

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:48.020
packed their bags), the avoidant one gives
free reign to all their reserves of pent up

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.040
romanticism and ardour – which feel utterly
safe to bring out, now that there seems so

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.670
little danger of reciprocation. Despite their
fury, the anxious person hears the honeyed

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:04.130
words and forthright promises, and – after
some initial doubts – can’t help but be

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:10.000
won over. The formerly distant partner appears
to have become, in the nick of time, as they’d

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.230
always wanted them to be, a warm soul. There
is no reason not to return: after all, it’s

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.020
not that they didn’t love this person, it
was the feeling they weren’t loved back

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.001
that was making things impossible…  For a time, there

00:02:23.001 --> 00:02:28.271
is bliss – and it seems that the couple
are headed for long-term happiness. Liberated

00:02:28.271 --> 00:02:33.040
from their anxiety around engulfment, the
avoidant partner gives free expression to

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:38.960
love; liberated from their fear of abandonment,
the anxious one is left feeling secure and

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:45.251
trusting. But soon enough the problems return.
Things become, as it were, too nice for the

00:02:45.251 --> 00:02:50.000
avoidant partner. It seems the anxious one
isn’t going to leave them any more, they’re

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.930
just going to stick around and seek ever greater
closeness – and so the old fear of engulfment

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.470
returns. They have no option but to start
to pull away again and get distant, which

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:05.170
gradually proves intolerable once again to
the anxious partner. Within weeks or months,

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:11.740
the pair are back in the same situation. Fierce
arguments are back: the words needy and cold

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:17.730
are once more in circulation. It’s time
for another crisis and another threat of departure.

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:24.340
It may go on like this for years, or a lifetime…
From the outside, it is almost funny. From

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:32.060
the inside, it is hellish. There are a few
ways out: the avoidant party can realise,

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:37.780
and learn to tolerate their fear of engulfment.
The anxious party can grow conscious of their

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:43.250
unnatural pull towards unfulfilling people,
refuse to go back after a crisis and seek

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.700
a future with more secure and reassuring sorts.
Or, yet

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:53.890
more hopefully, both partners can acquire
the vocabulary of attachment theory, come

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:58.750
to observe their repetitions, gain some insight
into aspects of their childhoods that drive

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:04.340
them on – and learn not to act out their
compulsions. They can learn the games they

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:09.250
are unconsciously playing – and then, to
the relief of all who care for them and to

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:14.560
the redemption of their relationship, refuse
to play them any longer.
