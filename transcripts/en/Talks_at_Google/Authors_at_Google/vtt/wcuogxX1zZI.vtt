00:00:00.337 --> 00:00:02.420
FEMALE SPEAKER: Please
welcome to the stage author

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:03.245
Glen Weldon.

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.280
GLEN WELDON: Thank you.

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:09.110
Hello, everyone.

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:11.140
Thank you very
much for having me.

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:14.210
I am delighted to be here
and to talk nerd stuff.

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:15.690
The book is about
the intersection

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.330
of Batman and nerd culture.

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:20.630
I'm using Batman as a lens
to look at nerd culture

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.000
because I think they
have a certain resonance.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.980
Batman is the ultimate
nerd, at least

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:26.240
that's the point of the book.

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.370
And there are several
different Batmen

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:32.150
over the course of many years.

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:37.090
And to insist as the culture now
does that the only Batman that

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.160
is real is the grim,
gritty, bad-ass version

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.392
is to ignore lots of history.

00:00:42.392 --> 00:00:44.350
So that's what we're
going to talk about today.

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.510
We can cough up the nerd
culture stuff in the Q&amp;A,

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:48.585
but today because this
is a visual medium

00:00:48.585 --> 00:00:49.960
and comics are a
visual medium, I

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.430
want to go over a
little bit of history.

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.906
May 1939 is when it all began
with this issue of "Detective

00:00:56.906 --> 00:00:57.405
Comics".

00:00:57.405 --> 00:01:00.250
Now up to this time--
this is issue number 27--

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.280
"Detective Comics"
was an anthology

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.390
series with 11 different
short features in it

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.790
with two-fisted detectives
with names like Speed Saunders

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.270
and Slam Bradley
and Buck Marshall.

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.280
And they introduced
Batman in number 27

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.150
because their walking
papers, their marching orders

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.390
were to make another Superman.

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.390
Superman had come
out the year before

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.510
and had been hugely
popular not just

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:28.080
selling millions and millions
of comics-- which he did--

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.420
but also as a
merchandising beast,

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.560
the first real merchandising
beast associated with comics.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.400
So two guys, Bob Kane and Bill
Finger, co-created Batman.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.560
If you ask Bob Cain, Bob Cain
will say that he created Batman

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.250
by himself.

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.690
And he went on record
many, many times saying

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:48.170
that it was all his idea.

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.210
In his autobiography
toward the end of his life

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.490
he gave a little bit
of hint, a little bit

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:53.847
of love toward Bill Finger.

00:01:53.847 --> 00:01:55.430
But it was really
too little, too late

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.410
because he had made his career
on saying it was all his idea.

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:00.900
Bob Kane was the artist.

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.080
Bill Finger was the writer.

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.280
Bob Kane went to Bill Finger
with an idea for a character

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.890
called the Batman.

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.140
It was a dude in a red
long johns, basically,

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.630
with giant bat wings--
mechanical bat wings--

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.350
blonde hair, a domino
mask, and he showed it

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:20.300
to Bill Finger who-- they kind
of bounced ideas off each other

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.960
all the time.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.222
And Bill Finger said
you're calling it Batman.

00:02:23.222 --> 00:02:25.680
And he's got this-- this is
red underwear man, what do you,

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:26.930
what do you, what do you mean?

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.860
This doesn't-- so he went
to a dictionary and he kind

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.320
of opened it to a picture of
a bat and said look, ears.

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.210
Look, if he's going to be
a creature of the night

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:39.990
he's going to need dark colors.

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.630
If he's going to be
somebody who is a vigilante

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.050
he's going to want
gloves so that he

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:46.510
doesn't leave fingerprints.

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.160
Basically everything
that we think of today

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.560
when we think of Batman
came from Bill Finger not

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.850
necessarily Bob Kane.

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.600
So this is the first
image that anybody saw.

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.370
This image-- I don't want
to keep dinging Bob Kane--

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.510
but he traced that image
from a Flash Gordon comic.

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:08.930
And you can see
that there is still

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:14.830
some vestige of the mechanical
bat-wing idea, but yeah.

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:23.320
This is the title page of
the first story of Batman.

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.400
Actually you can see
he's not Batman yet.

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.750
He is "The Bat-Man".

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.620
So back then when
he was introduced

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.890
he had a definite
article, he had a hyphen,

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:33.387
and he had scare quotes.

00:03:33.387 --> 00:03:34.970
He also had, if you
look at that image

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:38.413
there-- it doesn't necessarily
strike terror into your hearts,

00:03:38.413 --> 00:03:39.680
does it?

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.030
It looks a little goofy.

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.150
But the important thing is
you see the black silhouette

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:45.240
against the full moon.

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:50.460
That image, that--
icon-ography, iconography

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:54.692
is going to be a part of this
character for his entire life.

00:03:54.692 --> 00:03:56.400
The Batman-- a mysterious
and adventurous

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.080
figure fighting
for righteousness

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.150
and apprehending the
wrongdoers-- that's

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.733
where a hyphen should be, right
there between wrong and doer--

00:04:03.733 --> 00:04:06.140
in his lone battle against
the evil forces of society.

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:08.510
His identity remains
unknown, that's important.

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:11.780
When this story started
we met Bruce Wayne

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.499
as a bored socialite who was a
friend of Commissioner Gordon.

00:04:14.499 --> 00:04:17.040
We didn't find out that Bruce
Wayne was Batman until the very

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:18.940
last panel of this story.

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:22.224
But the first time we
see Batman is this.

00:04:22.224 --> 00:04:24.390
"As the two men leer over
their conquest they do not

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:26.556
notice a third menacing
figure standing behind them,

00:04:26.556 --> 00:04:28.060
it is The Bat-man!"

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.440
Exclamation point to the
Batman, three exclamation points

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.350
in case you missed it.

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:35.320
So again that dude down
there with the-- holding

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:39.300
the paper-- Bob
Kane traced that.

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:43.040
And these two goons have
just pilfered an old man's

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.220
safe and killed him.

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.140
And so this is Batman standing--
you can see it again--

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:52.420
standing in front of the
moon-- part of the iconography.

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:55.730
And he looks like Batman
to our modern eyes

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:59.260
if you allow for nearly
77 years of shift.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.120
So the color scheme checks out.

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:05.090
Again, back then, it
was blue with black

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:07.590
because if you just did black
without any kind of highlights

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:09.756
in it, it would just come
off as a big black smudge.

00:05:09.756 --> 00:05:12.090
Because that was the
printing process back then.

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.610
The one thing that's odd
to me, well, two things.

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:17.470
A, those ears are kind
of like devil's horns

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:19.840
kind of poking out of
either side of his head,

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.310
and the purple evening gloves.

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:25.800
Those are a thing.

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.710
The purple evening gloves
go away pretty quickly.

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:30.930
And whenever DC Comics
reprints this first issue

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:32.190
they kind of do away with it.

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:34.340
But it's a look.

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:36.410
Speaking of a look,
check out of that cape.

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:38.660
Now the cape is it an important
part of this character

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:40.440
and always will be.

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.540
For about 30 years after this
the cape is just an accessory.

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:47.670
In the '70s, artists like
Marshal Rogers and other folks

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:50.484
really make the
cape a living thing.

00:05:50.484 --> 00:05:52.275
And they use it to
direct the reader's eye.

00:05:52.275 --> 00:05:54.490
It becomes almost like
a silent narrator.

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:59.740
Here, it looks like dude is
basically wearing an umbrella.

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:02.450
But that's-- that's the guy.

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:06.260
Now the important thing
to know is that he

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:09.909
was a ripoff of The Shadow.

00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:11.450
That's not a
controversial assertion.

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:14.520
Both Bill Finger and Bob Kane
said, yeah, we kind of just

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:15.460
ripped off The Shadow.

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:18.920
The first story was a rip off
of a Shadow story, almost plot

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:20.290
point for plot point.

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:22.800
So both Bill Finger
and Bob Kane swiped.

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.050
It was a thing people did.

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:26.270
Because remember that
they're not making art here.

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:28.020
They are churning out content.

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:30.900
They are churning out as much
as they can as fast as they can.

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:35.770
Which is-- I give Bob Kane a
lot of guff for tracing as much

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:41.020
as he did-- he did a
lot-- it's-- he was stuck.

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:42.680
And he was doing what he can.

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:47.260
But Batman was not the
only Shadow rip-off.

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.982
Kind of running through comics
and pulp magazines of the time,

00:06:49.982 --> 00:06:51.440
there were a hell
of a lot of them.

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:55.006
He was not even the only
bat-themed Shadow ripoff.

00:06:55.006 --> 00:06:56.380
There were two
others, Black Bat,

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:57.963
who's that dude there
with the fedora,

00:06:57.963 --> 00:07:00.660
and The Bat in "Black
Book Detective".

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:03.190
They didn't hang around long
although The Black Bat actually

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:04.850
lasts until about the '50s.

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:08.860
But, yeah, so the same
shtick, right-- terrifying

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:13.260
your enemies, lurking
in the shadows,

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:16.910
and in The Shadow's case
and in Batman's case,

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:18.510
killing folk a lot.

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:24.690
But I'll come back
to that in a second.

00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:27.230
This is the origin.

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:31.330
Now he didn't have an origin
until about seven issues in.

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:34.850
Because, again, when
Superman was created

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:37.040
he was a science
fiction character.

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:39.730
You needed to explain why he
could jump and do all the stuff

00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:40.349
he could do.

00:07:40.349 --> 00:07:42.640
This guy was basically just
a detective who dressed up,

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:45.360
so you didn't necessarily
need a back-story for him.

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:47.430
But they gave him
one eventually.

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:49.780
Now those three panels
down there, you see,

00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:55.010
are the origin which we
have seen in 2016 a lot.

00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:58.587
We've seen it far too many
times, over and over again.

00:07:58.587 --> 00:08:00.920
By the way, the guy in the
corner there with a red cap--

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:01.470
traced.

00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:04.250
The guy up there in the
yellow hat-- traced.

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:08.280
The guy who's shooting
the gun-- traced.

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:11.576
This whole thing takes
place, this whole origin--

00:08:11.576 --> 00:08:13.200
because, again, they
had the real story

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:15.250
to get to-- takes
place in two pages.

00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:19.060
Page one, page
two, and that's it.

00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:20.890
That Batman down
there in the corner

00:08:20.890 --> 00:08:24.190
that is traced from a Tarzan--
very famous-- Tarzan image.

00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:25.700
That Bruce Wayne-- traced.

00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:28.700
Now I like the way this
page looks especially

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:32.299
with that very astonishing feat
of the dude in speedos raising

00:08:32.299 --> 00:08:33.150
the weight up.

00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:35.720
That just kind of
anchors your eye.

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:38.100
I like him right
there as a dude who

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:42.850
is a scientist and a really
incredibly buff weight lifter.

00:08:42.850 --> 00:08:45.710
You can also tell just from
visually looking at this page,

00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:48.420
to the right of that image
with the weight lifter,

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:51.470
he's pretty good
at interior design.

00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:53.900
One thing I want to put here
in the bottom left here.

00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:56.565
OK this is a very famous quote,
perhaps the most famous quote

00:08:56.565 --> 00:08:57.940
of this character,
"Criminals are

00:08:57.940 --> 00:08:59.780
a superstitious, cowardly lot.

00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:02.200
So my disguise must be
able to strike terror

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:03.520
into their hearts."

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:05.740
OK, keep that in mind.

00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:08.490
In this panel he is calling
criminals superstitious.

00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:11.400
In the very next
panel he says, "A bat.

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:14.790
It's an omen."

00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:17.540
Pick a lane, you
know what I mean?

00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:19.600
So again, but again
you can see the bat

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:22.000
against the full
thing of the moon.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.400
Now the most important
thing on this page

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:25.462
is not the bat flying in.

00:09:25.462 --> 00:09:27.920
It's not the criminals who are
superstitious, cowardly lot.

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:30.260
It's not how great
he looks in tights.

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.820
It's this panel.

00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:36.320
Now we've seen this origin
told and retold and retold.

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:38.580
And we will see it forever.

00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:41.200
But we always skip this panel.

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:43.650
And for me, this is what
makes Batman, Batman.

00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:47.092
Not what happened to him
but his reaction to it.

00:09:47.092 --> 00:09:48.800
"And I swear by the
spirits of my parents

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:51.160
to avenge their deaths by
spending the rest of my life

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:52.700
warring on all criminals."

00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:54.120
That's key.

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:55.067
It is not a vendetta.

00:09:55.067 --> 00:09:57.150
He's not going after the
guy who shot his parents.

00:09:57.150 --> 00:09:59.670
He's going against criminals.

00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:02.160
It's not a vendetta,
it's a crusade.

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:04.590
And I use that word advisedly,
because it's a loaded word,

00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:07.650
but it's bigger
than the thing that

00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:09.690
started him down this path.

00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:13.290
And if you forget that you are
focusing on the wrong thing.

00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:16.840
Now we will never see this today
because it's hokey as hell.

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:19.720
And it's a thing
a child would do.

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:22.870
It's a silly kind
of oath, right?

00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:24.870
But that is its power.

00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:27.120
These characters work,
if they work at all,

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:29.760
at a psychological,
elemental level.

00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:32.814
And they work because they
key into something here.

00:10:32.814 --> 00:10:33.730
Now just look at this.

00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:36.030
So he's got the
candle flame and then

00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:38.310
it's kind of echoed by the
single tear dripping down

00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:39.440
his cheek.

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:41.610
There's an elemental
power to this.

00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:46.750
And this panel is what
makes Batman a hero.

00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:50.110
It's what transformed
him from a vigilante

00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:55.020
into somebody who is, in
an act of self-rescue,

00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:58.040
this is how he overcomes
what happened to his parents.

00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:01.555
He is dedicating himself to
this notion of never again.

00:11:01.555 --> 00:11:03.680
What happened to me will
not happen to anybody else

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:05.710
because I'm not going to let it.

00:11:05.710 --> 00:11:08.030
There's a simple power in that.

00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:14.080
And to forget it is to
focus on this stuff.

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:21.260
In his first year Batman
killed 24 dudes, two vampires,

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:23.860
a brace of werewolves-- what
would you call it, a pack?

00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:26.470
What's the collective noun
for werewolves, pack--

00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:29.110
and a couple giant mutants.

00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:31.225
Here you can see
him toting a gun.

00:11:31.225 --> 00:11:33.600
And in this panel it's kind
of tough to see but it's just

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:35.891
as well because there are
some horrible, racist imagery

00:11:35.891 --> 00:11:39.170
in this panel, he is
pushing a jade statue

00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:43.460
on top of what looks like nine
hapless dudes crushing them

00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:43.960
completely.

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:46.780
And then just to put
a fine point on it,

00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:50.800
the idol of the Green
Dragon kills its own.

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:52.810
Well, you kind of
helped, you know.

00:11:52.810 --> 00:11:54.790
It didn't do it itself.

00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:57.930
You're kind of-- you've got to
put some-- you're in the mix.

00:11:57.930 --> 00:12:02.630
Now this violence
terrified the publisher

00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:05.220
because he was a
children's character.

00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:08.649
You could pretend to yourself
that all these other detectives

00:12:08.649 --> 00:12:11.190
had an appeal because, again,
adults read comics back then as

00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:12.640
well.

00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:16.900
But this character
was intended for kids.

00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:19.870
And this dark
violence was something

00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:22.550
that the publisher-- that
made the publisher very leery.

00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:26.104
Now it would be 10, 15 years
before an anti-comics crusade

00:12:26.104 --> 00:12:28.520
happened nationally-- and we'll
talk about that in a sec--

00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:32.249
but they just-- there
was a thin unease

00:12:32.249 --> 00:12:33.790
coming from the
publisher, especially

00:12:33.790 --> 00:12:38.080
after a panel in
Batman number one--

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:40.650
because he got his own
self-titled comic eventually--

00:12:40.650 --> 00:12:43.540
where he is flying the
bat plane and gunning down

00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:44.940
people with a machine gun.

00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:47.050
They're like, you know what?

00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:49.580
Maybe back off
that a little bit.

00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:52.000
So they want to do--
so the publisher wanted

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.069
to lighten the tone.

00:12:54.069 --> 00:12:55.860
Bill Finger, the writer,
thought, you know,

00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:57.630
I created this guy
who is basically--

00:12:57.630 --> 00:13:00.610
if you believe all this
fetishist bat stuff--

00:13:00.610 --> 00:13:01.530
he's a detective.

00:13:01.530 --> 00:13:03.080
He's basically Sherlock Holmes.

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:05.320
And this is the era
before thought balloons

00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:08.110
and before narration
like internal monologue.

00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:10.470
So if we wanted to
get access to what

00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:12.330
was going on inside
Batman's head,

00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:14.400
he needed to talk to himself.

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:16.412
Which was odd, so they
said, you know what?

00:13:16.412 --> 00:13:18.120
Let's give him somebody
to bounce off of.

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:21.140
It was Bob Kane's idea to make
the person that he bounced off

00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:22.860
of a kid.

00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:25.520
Because he figured this
is being written for kids.

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:28.870
We put a kid in it they can
identify with the character,

00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:31.010
and that's how we got to
the sensational character

00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:34.230
find of 1940, Robin
the boy wonder.

00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:36.760
Now even in the
marketing-- like, look at

00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:38.940
that-- we're shoving this
guy down your throat.

00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:40.920
Like you're going
to love this kid,

00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:42.544
whether you want to
or not because he's

00:13:42.544 --> 00:13:45.730
the sensational
character find of 1940.

00:13:45.730 --> 00:13:48.787
So "The Batman, that amazing,
weird figure of night at last

00:13:48.787 --> 00:13:50.620
takes under his protecting
mantle an ally it

00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:52.350
his relentless
fight against crime.

00:13:52.350 --> 00:13:54.090
Introducing is this issue an
exciting new figure" blah,

00:13:54.090 --> 00:13:54.430
blah, blah.

00:13:54.430 --> 00:13:55.070
Look at that.

00:13:55.070 --> 00:13:56.630
That is just promo copy.

00:13:56.630 --> 00:14:04.150
Now this made Batman from a
dark, lone figure of the night

00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:07.730
into-- look at his face--
look how proud he is.

00:14:07.730 --> 00:14:08.970
He's like, that's my boy.

00:14:08.970 --> 00:14:11.610
It's like, it's like he's a
Little League dad, you know.

00:14:11.610 --> 00:14:14.490
The guy's just sliding home.

00:14:14.490 --> 00:14:17.300
That's hugely important.

00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:19.700
Now does anybody see-- we've
all heard the jokes, right,

00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:21.860
the Batman and Robin jokes,
the ambiguously gay duo

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:24.460
jokes-- does anybody
see anything here

00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:29.702
that might, I don't know,
presage trouble to come?

00:14:29.702 --> 00:14:32.160
Is there anything in this copy
here that stands out at you?

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:33.493
I'm going to take a closer look.

00:14:33.493 --> 00:14:37.002
Anything here you might
want to be wary of?

00:14:37.002 --> 00:14:38.210
Let's go a little bit closer.

00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:46.360
"Takes under his
protecting mantle anally"

00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:48.510
Now that's me, right?

00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:51.900
Look at the space between
mantle and an ally.

00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:53.650
Mantle-- look at that
big old space there.

00:14:53.650 --> 00:14:55.877
Look at the space between
the N and the A, nothing.

00:14:55.877 --> 00:14:57.210
I'm not saying it's intentional.

00:14:57.210 --> 00:15:00.050
I'm saying, dude
couldn't catch a break,

00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:06.230
that all these jokes were fated
to be because, well, I mean,

00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:07.760
why?

00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:12.860
Because of panels
like this-- two dudes

00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:16.090
in a boat at night in a
park because it's night,

00:15:16.090 --> 00:15:17.790
because it's soft
breezes and moonlight.

00:15:17.790 --> 00:15:20.206
Now this is just, now I'm just
making the stuff up, right?

00:15:20.206 --> 00:15:21.920
I'm just pulling
panels out of context

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:23.420
and you can make
everything look bad

00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:25.128
if you pull panels
out of context, right?

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:30.820
And I just want to point out
here that for a 10-year-old boy

00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:32.240
Dick Grayson is jacked.

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:34.851
Look at that, that is a deltoid.

00:15:34.851 --> 00:15:37.350
And this very famous panel which
you might have seen before.

00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:41.420
So basically the joke is, and
it's not a joke, this was done.

00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:43.314
So the villain
says, "Not only you

00:15:43.314 --> 00:15:44.980
do but so is everyone
you have touched",

00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:47.045
because he's given him a
plague-- not important.

00:15:47.045 --> 00:15:48.920
"Jean Loring, I've signed
her death warrant".

00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:50.060
That's his girlfriend.

00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:51.320
"I gave Iris West
the kiss of death".

00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:53.611
That's his girlfriend. "Carol
Ferris in deadly danger".

00:15:53.611 --> 00:15:57.890
That's his girlfriend. "Robin--
what have I done to you?"

00:15:57.890 --> 00:16:00.650
Now again, none of
this is intentional.

00:16:00.650 --> 00:16:04.180
But people noticed, one
person in particular.

00:16:04.180 --> 00:16:07.090
This is Dr. Fredric
Wertham, M.D.

00:16:07.090 --> 00:16:09.820
He is a German-born
psychiatrist who

00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:12.830
in the 1940s-- late
1940s and early 1950s--

00:16:12.830 --> 00:16:16.690
waged a one-man crusade
against the comic book

00:16:16.690 --> 00:16:20.140
because it was fostering
juvenile delinquency.

00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:23.940
He had a lot of different
complaints about how comic

00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:26.260
books affected
things like literacy.

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:28.415
He said that breaking
up sentences into word

00:16:28.415 --> 00:16:29.790
balloons like that
made it harder

00:16:29.790 --> 00:16:32.350
for kids to learn to read.

00:16:32.350 --> 00:16:34.990
He didn't spend too much
of his time directly

00:16:34.990 --> 00:16:37.160
attacking Batman
and Robin because he

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:38.320
had bigger fish to fry.

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:40.210
There were crime comics
and horror comics

00:16:40.210 --> 00:16:46.070
and he would pull panels out of
context like I have just done.

00:16:46.070 --> 00:16:50.730
And he would point out the
very racist stereotypes,

00:16:50.730 --> 00:16:54.790
the very sexist stereotypes,
and the incredible violence,

00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:57.320
about which, dude had a point.

00:16:57.320 --> 00:17:00.500
I mean he actually
chased hundreds

00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:02.000
of people out of
the comics industry

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.200
and caused horror comics and
crime comics to basically,

00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:08.520
just gutted them and caused
a lot of publishing houses

00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:09.600
to close.

00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:12.099
But when it came to the crime
and the horror comics, I mean,

00:17:12.099 --> 00:17:13.310
dude kind of had a point.

00:17:13.310 --> 00:17:15.050
Now he also said
that Superman was

00:17:15.050 --> 00:17:18.640
a Nazi which must have come as a
surprise to his Jewish creators

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:21.500
and publishers and
writers, but fine.

00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:28.710
He said that Wonder Woman had
a touch of something sapphic

00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:32.224
to her, which, dude had a point.

00:17:32.224 --> 00:17:34.140
And finally, when it
came to Batman and Robin,

00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:36.389
I'm going to read what he
said about Batman and Robin.

00:17:36.389 --> 00:17:39.900
He only devoted four
pages to this book,

00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:42.440
four pages to Batman
and Robin in this book

00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:45.016
that he published in 1954.

00:17:45.016 --> 00:17:47.640
And what he said about them was
not, well, here's what he said.

00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:53.220
I'm going to use a fakey German
accent because I want to.

00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:57.520
And b, because I did do the
audio book for this book.

00:17:57.520 --> 00:17:59.900
And I did double
check just to make

00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:01.280
sure he still had the accent.

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:03.500
He never lost his
thick German accent.

00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:05.790
He was born in Germany.

00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:08.900
So this is what he said
about Batman and Robin.

00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:12.920
[FAKE GERMAN ACCENT] At home
they lead an idyllic life.

00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:19.224
They are both vain
on Dick Grayson.

00:18:19.224 --> 00:18:20.890
Bruce Wayne is described
as a socialite.

00:18:20.890 --> 00:18:24.190
And the official relationship
is that Dick is Bruce's ward.

00:18:24.190 --> 00:18:26.440
They live in sumptuous
quarters with beautiful flowers

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:29.380
in large vases and
have a butler, Alfred.

00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:33.510
Bruce is sometimes shown
in a dressing gown.

00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:36.240
As they sit by the fireplace
the young boy sometimes

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:37.830
worries about his partner.

00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:43.390
It is like a wish dream of two
homosexuals living together.

00:18:43.390 --> 00:18:47.120
[REGULAR VOICE] Now,
dude had a point,

00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:49.320
not the point that
he thought he did.

00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:52.480
He went on to say that
in a culture like America

00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:55.050
where homosexuality
was the great taboo--

00:18:55.050 --> 00:18:56.920
and remember this
is the 50s-- this

00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:58.930
is the height of the Red Scare.

00:18:58.930 --> 00:19:02.491
This is when the Bolsheviks
were coming for your children

00:19:02.491 --> 00:19:03.740
to turn them into pantywaists.

00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:06.780
Like there was a lot of fear
going around at this time.

00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:08.980
And he just fed
directly into that.

00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:12.300
What he said was, seeing
all those beautiful flowers

00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:18.230
in large vases and seeing
these two males together

00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:20.976
would incite in
young boys-- and he

00:19:20.976 --> 00:19:22.740
was talking to boys
at this point--

00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:26.830
young boys reading it the
sense that they might be gay.

00:19:26.830 --> 00:19:29.470
Now dude had a point,
but it was one that only

00:19:29.470 --> 00:19:33.400
applied to gay kids like me.

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:36.650
Because, again, the feelings
of guilt, shame-- check, check,

00:19:36.650 --> 00:19:40.390
check, check, check-- but
it's not-- you would not--

00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:42.840
if you were straight kid and
you saw two guys hanging out

00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:46.005
in a house you wouldn't-- it
would not even occur to you.

00:19:46.005 --> 00:19:48.380
If you were a gay kid and you
saw two guys hanging around

00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:54.164
in a house and you saw a panel
like this, for example, yeah,

00:19:54.164 --> 00:19:55.830
you might think there's
something there.

00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:58.550
Now this panel appeared
in a comic book

00:19:58.550 --> 00:20:02.650
that was published in the
spring of 1954 exactly

00:20:02.650 --> 00:20:06.130
as Dr. Fredric Wertham was
testifying before Congress.

00:20:06.130 --> 00:20:09.475
So the universe kind of handed
him this panel on a plate.

00:20:09.475 --> 00:20:11.100
Because, again, it
says, "And it begins

00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:12.660
like any other routine morning
in the lives of millionaire

00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:13.840
Bruce Wayne and his ward".

00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:17.390
So this thing, sharing
a bed, is routine.

00:20:17.390 --> 00:20:21.820
And they have a good sleep.
"C'mon, Dick-- a cold shower.

00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:23.670
A big breakfast!"

00:20:23.670 --> 00:20:25.710
So what happens next?

00:20:25.710 --> 00:20:28.349
Well, as I say, a lot
of crime comics go away.

00:20:28.349 --> 00:20:29.640
A lot of horror comics go away.

00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:31.570
Super heroes change.

00:20:31.570 --> 00:20:36.320
The most famous double act
in comics, Batman and Robin,

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:38.490
becomes an ensemble.

00:20:38.490 --> 00:20:40.770
Because having these two
dudes hang out in the house

00:20:40.770 --> 00:20:44.310
together even with their butler
was just a little too close

00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:44.820
to the line.

00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:48.430
So we introduce, first
comes Ace the Bat-Hound.

00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:51.530
It's a dog in a mask, sure.

00:20:51.530 --> 00:20:56.100
Then comes in that upper
right corner, Bat-Mite

00:20:56.100 --> 00:21:00.690
a inter-dimensional
magical imp who

00:21:00.690 --> 00:21:02.310
wears a costume like Batman.

00:21:02.310 --> 00:21:04.447
Then comes Batwoman
and then comes

00:21:04.447 --> 00:21:06.405
Bat-girl-- with a hyphen--
not the same Batgirl

00:21:06.405 --> 00:21:07.220
that comes later.

00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:12.270
And then finally, and most
awesomely, Mogo the Bat-Ape.

00:21:12.270 --> 00:21:16.220
For about 15 years
this is-- he becomes

00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:19.060
kind of the patriarch
of this family of people

00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:21.970
who dress up like bats.

00:21:21.970 --> 00:21:26.410
This is Batman in 1965.

00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:29.327
Whack, smiling, he's got
a little-- they changed up

00:21:29.327 --> 00:21:30.410
his wardrobe a little bit.

00:21:30.410 --> 00:21:32.830
They gave him a circle
around his bat insignia

00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:34.990
which he didn't have before.

00:21:34.990 --> 00:21:37.360
This is 1965.

00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:40.960
This is 1970-- bit
of a difference.

00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:45.870
Cartoon, photorealism, and I
say photo realism advisedly

00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:49.170
because look at that,
this is Neil Adams art.

00:21:49.170 --> 00:21:51.950
The moon is in front of you
and yet the shadow of Batman

00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:52.840
is falling forward.

00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:56.076
So again-- ism, photorealism.

00:21:56.076 --> 00:21:57.950
And it's my favorite
part of this whole thing

00:21:57.950 --> 00:22:02.230
is he standing over the graves
of Delores and Juan Muerto--

00:22:02.230 --> 00:22:05.014
Dolores and Juan Death.

00:22:05.014 --> 00:22:06.430
Honey, the Deaths
are coming over.

00:22:06.430 --> 00:22:07.971
Oh, I hate when the
Deaths come over.

00:22:07.971 --> 00:22:10.970
So this is "The Secret
of the Waiting Graves".

00:22:10.970 --> 00:22:16.899
What happened between
1965 and 1970?

00:22:16.899 --> 00:22:17.440
Anybody know?

00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:22.984
This dude happened.

00:22:22.984 --> 00:22:25.840
This show premiered in 1966.

00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:29.490
What they did when they made
this television series was they

00:22:29.490 --> 00:22:34.010
realized that they could
take advantage of the pop art

00:22:34.010 --> 00:22:35.740
movement that was
cresting at the time.

00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:38.800
Pop art valued things
that were colorful,

00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:41.870
that were mass produced,
that were cheesy,

00:22:41.870 --> 00:22:44.600
and that were disposable.

00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:48.700
Comics-- pop art, the pop art
movement fetishized comics.

00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:52.890
Roy Lichtenstein made a career
out of taking comic art panels

00:22:52.890 --> 00:22:54.640
and selling them for
thousands of dollars

00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:56.970
into art galleries
and art museums.

00:22:56.970 --> 00:23:01.420
So they could take the existing
comic, the Batman comic,

00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:04.840
and just not adapt it, not turn
it into an adventure serial

00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:07.730
like they would something
else, but just pick it up,

00:23:07.730 --> 00:23:09.730
cut and paste it onto
the television screen,

00:23:09.730 --> 00:23:11.900
fit it into a half
an hour format.

00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:14.550
The difference is
they would assert

00:23:14.550 --> 00:23:19.110
every cheesy, silly,
kid-friendly aspect,

00:23:19.110 --> 00:23:23.170
every trope that
is in these 1964

00:23:23.170 --> 00:23:27.407
comics with a tremendous
sense of gravity.

00:23:27.407 --> 00:23:29.490
The way the producers
described it to the writers,

00:23:29.490 --> 00:23:31.940
as if we were dropping
the bomb on Hiroshima.

00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:34.510
This is how heavy, this is
how serious we want everybody

00:23:34.510 --> 00:23:35.070
to take it.

00:23:35.070 --> 00:23:37.560
There is no winking
to the camera.

00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:38.540
There's no mugging.

00:23:38.540 --> 00:23:42.210
It is all delivered as
straight as possible.

00:23:42.210 --> 00:23:44.610
And it became, because
of that disconnect

00:23:44.610 --> 00:23:48.430
it's because of that--
because kids loved it,

00:23:48.430 --> 00:23:51.470
because again, pow-zap--
and it was colorful

00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:52.430
and it looked great.

00:23:52.430 --> 00:23:55.720
And adults loved it because
it was funny as hell.

00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:58.950
The people who didn't
love it were the nerds.

00:23:58.950 --> 00:24:03.390
They were there in 1966,
writing into fanzines,

00:24:03.390 --> 00:24:05.410
going nuts about this show.

00:24:05.410 --> 00:24:07.930
I found several
people just completely

00:24:07.930 --> 00:24:10.310
outraged by the
notion of this show

00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:12.900
and how it was making
fun of their character.

00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:15.740
In fact it wasn't making fun,
as I point out in the book.

00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:20.220
This was-- if you want somebody
to take Batman seriously,

00:24:20.220 --> 00:24:21.900
this show takes
Batman seriously--

00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:24.814
the Batman of those 1964 comics.

00:24:24.814 --> 00:24:25.730
But man they hated it.

00:24:25.730 --> 00:24:32.944
So when the show was over--
and this fad faded quickly.

00:24:32.944 --> 00:24:34.610
Within two years they
had three seasons,

00:24:34.610 --> 00:24:36.420
something like
128 episodes which

00:24:36.420 --> 00:24:39.600
is why it lived on in
syndication forever.

00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:44.540
The makers of Batman comics,
and all DC Comics basically,

00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:47.040
said they looked
around, they found out

00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:50.590
that their kid audience
was pretty much gone.

00:24:50.590 --> 00:24:54.560
Who were reading comics now
were those nerds, the teens

00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:55.860
and adults.

00:24:55.860 --> 00:24:58.900
And teens and adults wanted
something a little bit meatier.

00:24:58.900 --> 00:25:00.640
They wanted
something-- they wanted

00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:04.150
heroes, like Marvel
heroes, who had troubles,

00:25:04.150 --> 00:25:06.900
who couldn't pay the rent,
whose Aunt May was dying,

00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:10.920
who were angst-ridden, who
had feelings of inadequacy.

00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:13.630
Because we went
from having comics

00:25:13.630 --> 00:25:17.260
to be kid wish-fulfillment to
adolescent wish-fulfillment

00:25:17.260 --> 00:25:18.880
and all that that entails.

00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:21.156
So at the same time
this was happening,

00:25:21.156 --> 00:25:22.530
the comic book
industry basically

00:25:22.530 --> 00:25:27.220
decided to cut kids loose and
to focus on the teen and adult

00:25:27.220 --> 00:25:27.940
audience.

00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:29.430
I call it the great inward turn.

00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:31.055
So they get it out
of the spinner racks

00:25:31.055 --> 00:25:32.010
in grocery stores.

00:25:32.010 --> 00:25:35.510
And we start to see the first
fan shops, the first comic book

00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:39.010
shops where nerds can
kind of be among their own

00:25:39.010 --> 00:25:43.020
and dissect story lines and
point out where there's been

00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:45.960
some contradiction in canon.

00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:50.920
And so what Denny O'Neil, who
is the writer of this reboot

00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:53.200
of Batman, what he
decided to do was

00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:58.450
to look back to that first year
of Batman comics for something

00:25:58.450 --> 00:26:02.490
that he could, he could
use, he could excavate,

00:26:02.490 --> 00:26:05.720
and find an affinity with this
new audience of older teens

00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:06.940
and adults.

00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:09.880
And he found that oath.

00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:14.690
That oath went from being
a single plot point--

00:26:14.690 --> 00:26:16.250
like this is how
you describe, this

00:26:16.250 --> 00:26:19.610
is how you get them into the get
up-- every hero has an origin.

00:26:19.610 --> 00:26:21.160
We just have to kind
of tick that box

00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:23.250
to get them to put
on the bat ears.

00:26:23.250 --> 00:26:26.900
He decided that what
Batman needed to do

00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:29.300
was have an obsession.

00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:30.580
OK this is the 70s.

00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:32.940
Pop psychology is
becoming a thing.

00:26:32.940 --> 00:26:38.880
And we need this oath to be the
thing that is all consuming.

00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:41.690
Now he has-- when you give
him obsession like that,

00:26:41.690 --> 00:26:43.380
you also give him a personality.

00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:45.842
He's aloof.

00:26:45.842 --> 00:26:47.050
He's grim.

00:26:47.050 --> 00:26:48.980
He is increasingly gritty.

00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:50.060
But he wasn't quite done.

00:26:50.060 --> 00:26:53.220
Most important thing to do
after that, get rid of the kid.

00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:58.600
So they ship Dick Grayson
off to Hudson University,

00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:02.214
and effectively ending,
at this point, the Batman

00:27:02.214 --> 00:27:03.130
and Robin partnership.

00:27:03.130 --> 00:27:06.530
Which to this day, still
has these connotations.

00:27:06.530 --> 00:27:08.980
The ghost of Fredric Wertham
hangs over these characters

00:27:08.980 --> 00:27:12.280
whenever you see Batman
and Robin together.

00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:16.530
And again it's not
entirely fair but it's

00:27:16.530 --> 00:27:18.220
a thing you have to deal with.

00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:23.230
So we can get rid of Dick
Grayson as fair as possible.

00:27:23.230 --> 00:27:26.230
So then for the next
15 years you have,

00:27:26.230 --> 00:27:29.860
in that upper left corner,
that's the Batman that we saw

00:27:29.860 --> 00:27:33.780
in comics-- dark,
grim, , gritty violent.

00:27:33.780 --> 00:27:35.820
Why is the Joker holding a fish?

00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:38.389
Never mind, not important,
it's in the book.

00:27:38.389 --> 00:27:40.930
You want to find out why he's
holding the fish, it's in book.

00:27:40.930 --> 00:27:45.350
But comics at this point were
read by a few thousand people.

00:27:45.350 --> 00:27:47.560
The Batman that the
rest of the world saw

00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:50.120
is the one there
in the lower right,

00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:52.080
the Super Friends
Batman, who drove around

00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:54.130
in a car that looked
like the television show,

00:27:54.130 --> 00:27:57.930
the '66 television show,
who called Robin "old chum",

00:27:57.930 --> 00:27:59.550
who palled around like this.

00:27:59.550 --> 00:28:02.850
So again, Batman alone
as a grim avenger

00:28:02.850 --> 00:28:09.850
of the night in the comics
but that Batman in mass media,

00:28:09.850 --> 00:28:13.540
on television, seen and
enjoyed by millions.

00:28:13.540 --> 00:28:15.730
This is when the
difference emerges

00:28:15.730 --> 00:28:19.180
between Batman the character,
and Batman the idea.

00:28:19.180 --> 00:28:21.480
Nerds like me love
Batman the character.

00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:22.870
We love all the interplay.

00:28:22.870 --> 00:28:26.990
We love this kind of endless
iteration that goes on

00:28:26.990 --> 00:28:30.880
and we treasure the
reboots and retcons.

00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:34.270
And we love having these, again,
these Talmudic dissections

00:28:34.270 --> 00:28:36.940
of what's going
on in the comics.

00:28:36.940 --> 00:28:37.680
That's nerds.

00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:40.410
Normals want a story,
just tell me a story.

00:28:40.410 --> 00:28:42.350
Just give me the bullet points.

00:28:42.350 --> 00:28:46.490
And that's the
Batman, the idea, that

00:28:46.490 --> 00:28:51.040
continued to exist in the
public mind for 15 years

00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:54.070
until 1985 and 1986.

00:28:54.070 --> 00:28:57.990
This is "Batman The Dark Knight
Returns" by Frank Miller.

00:28:57.990 --> 00:29:03.700
This book was a phenomenon
when it came out because, well,

00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:06.480
in the book I try
to pick it apart.

00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:09.550
He wasn't writing this
book for the nerds

00:29:09.550 --> 00:29:10.889
he knew were Batman fans.

00:29:10.889 --> 00:29:12.430
They were already
in the back pocket.

00:29:12.430 --> 00:29:14.221
They were going to buy
the book regardless.

00:29:14.221 --> 00:29:17.130
It was like this special mini
series on prestige paper.

00:29:17.130 --> 00:29:19.130
He knew that they were
there in his back pocket.

00:29:19.130 --> 00:29:21.950
He was writing this
book for the people

00:29:21.950 --> 00:29:24.350
over the wall of the
little nerd enclave

00:29:24.350 --> 00:29:26.730
that comics had built
around themselves.

00:29:26.730 --> 00:29:29.770
He was pointing like Babe
Ruth out beyond the wall

00:29:29.770 --> 00:29:34.760
to those people, those normals,
for whom Batman meant POW-ZAP.

00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:36.210
If they remembered
Batman at all,

00:29:36.210 --> 00:29:38.010
if they gave him even
a passing thought,

00:29:38.010 --> 00:29:41.170
they thought about
two dudes fighting,

00:29:41.170 --> 00:29:43.670
having big brawls in these
candy-colored warehouses.

00:29:43.670 --> 00:29:44.720
POW-ZAP.

00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:48.330
That's why you can actually read
this book "Dark Knight Returns"

00:29:48.330 --> 00:29:50.750
as the story of what would
happen if the Adam West

00:29:50.750 --> 00:29:56.450
Batman came back and found that
the old tropes, the old ways

00:29:56.450 --> 00:29:58.110
of doing things,
didn't work anymore.

00:29:58.110 --> 00:29:59.485
So you can see
when he introduces

00:29:59.485 --> 00:30:02.410
Batman in the upper
left hand corner that

00:30:02.410 --> 00:30:06.080
is as close as you're going
to get to the Neal Adams, yes,

00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:09.590
but also the Adam West Batman.

00:30:09.590 --> 00:30:11.872
Then he kind of walks
people through the history

00:30:11.872 --> 00:30:12.580
of the character.

00:30:12.580 --> 00:30:14.704
So we get an old costume
right there in the middle.

00:30:14.704 --> 00:30:17.700
We also-- to take any of
that weirdness between Batman

00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:20.120
and Robin out of it,
he makes Robin a girl.

00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:22.960
Boom, no homoeroticism anymore,
that's all you got to do.

00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:23.600
Gone.

00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:25.950
And then we also have
him fight Superman

00:30:25.950 --> 00:30:34.980
in a battle which we're still
getting elements of today--

00:30:34.980 --> 00:30:36.310
this Friday we're going to get.

00:30:36.310 --> 00:30:39.040
This pretty much,
this panel right here,

00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:42.410
over and over and over again.

00:30:42.410 --> 00:30:45.300
And he introduces this
concept of conflict.

00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:46.367
They were pals.

00:30:46.367 --> 00:30:47.950
They were like,
remember when-- you're

00:30:47.950 --> 00:30:50.500
too young-- remember
when Tom and Jerry when

00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:53.090
they were on television
in the '70s and '80s,

00:30:53.090 --> 00:30:54.722
they became pals.

00:30:54.722 --> 00:30:56.430
Because they didn't
want to-- the parents

00:30:56.430 --> 00:30:58.260
groups were complaining that
there was too much violence.

00:30:58.260 --> 00:30:59.760
So they just kind of
hung out together.

00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:01.260
Well that's what
Superman and Batman

00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:03.970
for most of their
history until 1985,

00:31:03.970 --> 00:31:08.440
when Frank Miller
introduces conflict.

00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:12.730
So one of the things that I
talk about in the book a lot

00:31:12.730 --> 00:31:16.180
is that a character like Batman
is a comic book character.

00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:20.050
Comic books are basically soap
operas-- narrative-- endless,

00:31:20.050 --> 00:31:22.165
iterating narrative
without an ending.

00:31:22.165 --> 00:31:24.040
These characters are
heavily licensed nuggets

00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:27.010
of intellectual
property who are not

00:31:27.010 --> 00:31:29.180
supposed to grow and change.

00:31:29.180 --> 00:31:32.490
They're not supposed to do
what fiction characters,

00:31:32.490 --> 00:31:33.890
fictional characters do.

00:31:33.890 --> 00:31:36.010
What makes a story a story
is you have an ending.

00:31:36.010 --> 00:31:38.530
And the person is a different
person at the end of the story

00:31:38.530 --> 00:31:39.530
than they are at the beginning.

00:31:39.530 --> 00:31:41.113
Can't happen with
Batman unless you do

00:31:41.113 --> 00:31:42.434
some kind of Elseworld stuff.

00:31:42.434 --> 00:31:43.850
What Frank Miller
did was, he knew

00:31:43.850 --> 00:31:46.910
that if I give this-- if we look
at this character at the end

00:31:46.910 --> 00:31:48.950
of his career, all of
a sudden the stakes

00:31:48.950 --> 00:31:52.297
are rising because his physical
prowess isn't where it was,

00:31:52.297 --> 00:31:53.880
where he's at the
height of his career

00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:55.546
and also at the
beginning of his career.

00:31:55.546 --> 00:31:57.210
So that's what "Batman
Year One", which

00:31:57.210 --> 00:31:58.680
he wrote the next year, does.

00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:01.499
It basically says,
here's how he came to be.

00:32:01.499 --> 00:32:03.290
But he doesn't go
through the origin again.

00:32:03.290 --> 00:32:08.010
We get a glimpse of the guns
and the pearls and everything.

00:32:08.010 --> 00:32:10.630
But he mostly-- it's
a process piece,

00:32:10.630 --> 00:32:13.370
especially how do
I go from a guy who

00:32:13.370 --> 00:32:15.490
I know what I want to do.

00:32:15.490 --> 00:32:18.590
How do I get to that
guy right there?

00:32:21.620 --> 00:32:26.130
Now when you take a
character like Batman

00:32:26.130 --> 00:32:27.880
out of the comic book
page and you put him

00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:30.337
into any other medium,
you change him--

00:32:30.337 --> 00:32:32.670
for the better, for the worse,
sometimes doesn't matter.

00:32:32.670 --> 00:32:34.340
We'll see.

00:32:34.340 --> 00:32:37.816
But what you're doing
is you are overlaying

00:32:37.816 --> 00:32:39.190
your own stuff,
your own baggage,

00:32:39.190 --> 00:32:40.190
on top of the character.

00:32:40.190 --> 00:32:44.450
Tim Burton's kind of
outsider, emo weirdness

00:32:44.450 --> 00:32:46.465
on top of the character--
Joel Schumacher

00:32:46.465 --> 00:32:48.714
is whatever the hell that
was on top of the character.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.597
Christopher Nolan's concerns
with the surveillance state

00:32:54.597 --> 00:32:56.680
and terrorism and it doesn't
really hang together.

00:32:56.680 --> 00:32:58.090
But never mind, it's important.

00:32:58.090 --> 00:33:00.950
He's kind of drafting
on big ideas.

00:33:00.950 --> 00:33:03.217
And then you got Ben
Affleck up there.

00:33:03.217 --> 00:33:04.800
That is just the
funniest-- doesn't it

00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:07.320
look like he just is like
he's taking a class picture

00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:09.270
and he doesn't want to be there?

00:33:09.270 --> 00:33:13.080
Just like he's a sullen emo kid
which, the story checks out.

00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:18.030
So again, to adapt
this character

00:33:18.030 --> 00:33:20.570
is to change the character.

00:33:20.570 --> 00:33:24.170
And in the very first
1989 Batman film, who

00:33:24.170 --> 00:33:26.270
killed Bruce Wayne's parents?

00:33:26.270 --> 00:33:29.980
The Joker, because that
is the action movie trope.

00:33:29.980 --> 00:33:33.290
That is-- when you
put a character that

00:33:33.290 --> 00:33:34.930
doesn't end into
an action movie,

00:33:34.930 --> 00:33:36.550
you give him the
three act structure.

00:33:36.550 --> 00:33:37.420
You give him the love interest.

00:33:37.420 --> 00:33:38.430
You give him the rising action.

00:33:38.430 --> 00:33:40.430
You give him the big
reveal, that the thing that

00:33:40.430 --> 00:33:43.520
happened in the first reel
is solved by the thing that

00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:44.490
happens in the end.

00:33:44.490 --> 00:33:47.400
It turns Batman into
Charles Bronson when

00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:49.020
you have this revenge story.

00:33:49.020 --> 00:33:52.220
And the thing about
superheroes is that they're not

00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:53.060
action movie heroes.

00:33:53.060 --> 00:33:54.067
They do not kill.

00:33:54.067 --> 00:33:54.900
They have restraint.

00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:56.660
It would be the easiest
thing in the world

00:33:56.660 --> 00:34:00.810
to have Batman just go in with
an Oozie and blow things down.

00:34:00.810 --> 00:34:02.550
But he's not Rambo.

00:34:02.550 --> 00:34:03.750
He has restraint.

00:34:03.750 --> 00:34:05.530
He has a genre conventions.

00:34:05.530 --> 00:34:08.067
With in genre conventions
you have creativity.

00:34:08.067 --> 00:34:09.650
If you do away with
genre conventions,

00:34:09.650 --> 00:34:11.066
you're not writing
a Batman story.

00:34:11.066 --> 00:34:14.139
Now people ask me
which of these,

00:34:14.139 --> 00:34:15.973
or the one in the books,
which is my Batman?

00:34:15.973 --> 00:34:17.680
The whole point of
the book is that there

00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:19.989
is many different Batman,
many different Batman exist.

00:34:19.989 --> 00:34:23.820
We project onto this
character which one we want.

00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:28.940
My Batman is not the Adam
West one, although I love him.

00:34:28.940 --> 00:34:33.100
My Batman is the one
that I think nailed it.

00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:35.989
We have taken this character
out of the comic book medium

00:34:35.989 --> 00:34:36.739
many times.

00:34:36.739 --> 00:34:38.670
Only once did we nail it.

00:34:38.670 --> 00:34:42.110
And that is "Batman the Animated
Series" in the early 90s.

00:34:42.110 --> 00:34:45.030
Again, all those
other forms of media

00:34:45.030 --> 00:34:47.380
put the directors, the
writers, the screenplays,

00:34:47.380 --> 00:34:51.120
the studios baggage on
top of the character.

00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:55.179
This series stripped
everything else away,

00:34:55.179 --> 00:34:57.270
leaving us with
as close a view as

00:34:57.270 --> 00:34:59.970
were ever going to
get of who Batman is

00:34:59.970 --> 00:35:01.240
and why he does what he does.

00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:03.657
It's also just in terms
of design, it's amazing.

00:35:03.657 --> 00:35:05.240
You're basically
taking the comic book

00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:09.850
and giving it fluidity
and movement and strength.

00:35:09.850 --> 00:35:11.270
And also-- and I
don't think this

00:35:11.270 --> 00:35:15.500
is a coincidence-- the
half hour syndicated

00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:18.160
format of the animated
series is as close as we

00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:22.200
can get to the comic book
format where things don't really

00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:23.050
change at the end.

00:35:23.050 --> 00:35:27.152
Where he's still the same dude,
but over the course of time,

00:35:27.152 --> 00:35:28.610
over the course of
several seasons,

00:35:28.610 --> 00:35:31.140
we can allow a little bit
more breathing room in there.

00:35:31.140 --> 00:35:33.840
We can actually
make a character.

00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:37.800
We can give-- we can have some
funnier episodes, some darker

00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:38.480
episodes.

00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:40.920
We can allow these relationships
between these characters

00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:44.700
to deepen and to actually
allow for his characterization.

00:35:44.700 --> 00:35:48.260
So I'm going to close
with a very short story.

00:35:48.260 --> 00:35:52.900
Which is that I was
at Comic-Con in 2013

00:35:52.900 --> 00:35:55.700
doing some research for the
book interviewing people.

00:35:55.700 --> 00:35:58.070
And it was the last day
of the convention floor.

00:35:58.070 --> 00:36:01.620
And it was 2013, there were
Batman all over the damn place.

00:36:01.620 --> 00:36:04.110
They were all the
Christopher Nolan Batman.

00:36:04.110 --> 00:36:05.410
And you can spot them.

00:36:05.410 --> 00:36:06.993
Now if you've never
been to Comic-Con,

00:36:06.993 --> 00:36:09.740
it's just this giant floor
bursting with color and lights

00:36:09.740 --> 00:36:10.710
and sounds.

00:36:10.710 --> 00:36:14.090
And you could see the
Christopher Nolan Batman

00:36:14.090 --> 00:36:16.780
from a mile away because they
were just absorbing light.

00:36:16.780 --> 00:36:18.730
They were like these
little black worker ants.

00:36:18.730 --> 00:36:20.480
They were kind of
milling about the floor.

00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:21.825
They were all pissed.

00:36:21.825 --> 00:36:23.200
They were all
doing very method--

00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:25.140
I smiled at one when he passed
me and he kind of growls.

00:36:25.140 --> 00:36:26.330
I was like, good for you.

00:36:26.330 --> 00:36:28.700
Well done.

00:36:28.700 --> 00:36:35.730
And then I turned and I saw
Batman, the Adam West Batman.

00:36:35.730 --> 00:36:37.960
And it was perfect.

00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:41.840
Every detail of that
costume was spot on,

00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:47.620
the wrinkles of the evening
gloves, the tininess

00:36:47.620 --> 00:36:51.750
of the insignia-- which makes
it seem more polite somehow,

00:36:51.750 --> 00:36:56.180
like he doesn't want to make
a big thing-- the bulkiness

00:36:56.180 --> 00:36:58.870
of the utility
belt, and the cowl

00:36:58.870 --> 00:37:00.510
which have these
weird like drag queen

00:37:00.510 --> 00:37:03.330
eyebrows drawn on it
for no reason, none.

00:37:03.330 --> 00:37:06.720
And I was like, dude,
that is, that is perfect.

00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:08.620
Do you have any idea
how perfect that is?

00:37:08.620 --> 00:37:11.390
And he said to me, do
you want a picture?

00:37:11.390 --> 00:37:13.520
And I said, well I hadn't
but now all of a sudden,

00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:14.430
I very much did.

00:37:14.430 --> 00:37:16.140
So I was like, yes, definitely.

00:37:16.140 --> 00:37:19.910
So I didn't take pictures of
people there because I just

00:37:19.910 --> 00:37:21.220
didn't.

00:37:21.220 --> 00:37:24.990
So he backs up into the
aisle and I'm like, OK.

00:37:24.990 --> 00:37:26.550
And he says, do you
want me to pose?

00:37:26.550 --> 00:37:33.490
And again, I hadn't, but
now, sure, do it-- go nuts.

00:37:33.490 --> 00:37:34.750
Isn't that perfect?

00:37:34.750 --> 00:37:35.550
Look at that guy.

00:37:35.550 --> 00:37:37.008
So that's-- he's
doing the Batusi--

00:37:37.008 --> 00:37:39.690
what I want to point
out here is the paunch.

00:37:39.690 --> 00:37:40.920
The paunch is perfect.

00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:42.503
Right next to him--
you can't see it--

00:37:42.503 --> 00:37:44.130
but there was a
300 soldier dude--

00:37:44.130 --> 00:37:45.671
you know the Frank
Miller 300 soldier

00:37:45.671 --> 00:37:48.780
guy-- who was just jacked
and had 0% body fat.

00:37:48.780 --> 00:37:52.370
And you could tell that this
guy just ate chicken breasts

00:37:52.370 --> 00:37:53.822
and guzzled Muscle Milk.

00:37:53.822 --> 00:37:56.030
So I figured that there must
be some kind of training

00:37:56.030 --> 00:37:57.300
procedure for that paunch.

00:37:57.300 --> 00:37:59.410
That must be like pasta
buffets and Schlitz.

00:37:59.410 --> 00:38:02.680
I think it's the way you get
to that thing right there.

00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:05.030
And again, I should
point out as well

00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:07.480
that it's not fair to Adam
West to a kind of concentrate

00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:10.190
on the paunch because
Adam West was trim.

00:38:10.190 --> 00:38:13.270
His stunt double had
a bit of a thing.

00:38:13.270 --> 00:38:16.325
So every time you
see them fighting,

00:38:16.325 --> 00:38:17.700
you get a little
bit of a wiggle.

00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:22.800
But that was the end of
my Comic-Con experience.

00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:25.170
All right, thank you very much.

00:38:25.170 --> 00:38:26.850
Let's do some questions.

00:38:26.850 --> 00:38:29.310
If anybody has any questions
about any aspect of the stuff

00:38:29.310 --> 00:38:31.802
I kind of breezed
through right then.

00:38:34.801 --> 00:38:37.050
AUDIENCE: First, thanks to
you so much for coming here

00:38:37.050 --> 00:38:39.257
to speak with us.

00:38:39.257 --> 00:38:41.090
I wish I could ask you
this after the review

00:38:41.090 --> 00:38:43.100
embargo for Batman versus
Superman was lifted,

00:38:43.100 --> 00:38:45.740
but I'll just try it anyway.

00:38:45.740 --> 00:38:47.700
How do you feel
about the direction

00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:50.630
the DC cinematic universe is
taking Batman with the newest

00:38:50.630 --> 00:38:51.130
movie?

00:38:51.130 --> 00:38:54.900
GLEN WELDON: Yeah, I haven't
seen it so I can talk.

00:38:54.900 --> 00:38:58.330
Because actually
the press screening

00:38:58.330 --> 00:39:01.360
is actually tomorrow night when
I'm having the book launch.

00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:03.360
So I feel, I think
that's the universe

00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:05.889
kind of cutting me a break.

00:39:05.889 --> 00:39:07.930
They learned the wrong
lesson from Green Lantern,

00:39:07.930 --> 00:39:10.027
which Green Lantern sucked.

00:39:10.027 --> 00:39:11.860
But it didn't suck
because there were jokes.

00:39:11.860 --> 00:39:13.080
It didn't suck
because they tried

00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:14.288
to inject some humor into it.

00:39:14.288 --> 00:39:16.560
It sucked for a whole
host of reasons.

00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:21.030
And to go-- to try to
fit the Christopher Nolan

00:39:21.030 --> 00:39:25.160
model, the tone, onto
a character like Batman

00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:28.290
makes in certain amount of
sense-- grim, dour, gritty,

00:39:28.290 --> 00:39:29.840
story checks out.

00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:32.500
To try to fit in on the
Man of Steel, on Superman,

00:39:32.500 --> 00:39:35.160
is just a fundamental misread
of who this character is.

00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:36.430
They are not the same.

00:39:36.430 --> 00:39:38.520
They work in the same universe.

00:39:38.520 --> 00:39:41.060
But you have to deal with
him in very different tones.

00:39:41.060 --> 00:39:44.690
So you know what, I said on
the Pop Culture Happy Hour

00:39:44.690 --> 00:39:48.640
that I believe that
this film could be good.

00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:52.460
The more I read about
it, the more I see it,

00:39:52.460 --> 00:39:56.690
I really-- I live in a
tortured kind of hope.

00:39:56.690 --> 00:39:59.779
But just this
morning Ben Affleck

00:39:59.779 --> 00:40:02.320
said, yeah, I don't think I'm
going to take my kid to see it.

00:40:06.070 --> 00:40:11.130
So the story about the detective
ninja and the flying guy

00:40:11.130 --> 00:40:12.150
it's not for kids.

00:40:12.150 --> 00:40:13.441
None of this stuff is for kids.

00:40:13.441 --> 00:40:15.326
That doesn't make
any sense to me.

00:40:15.326 --> 00:40:16.700
AUDIENCE: Would
you say it's kind

00:40:16.700 --> 00:40:19.290
of going through its own
inward turn, or sorry--

00:40:19.290 --> 00:40:20.420
GLEN WELDON: Oh, sure.

00:40:20.420 --> 00:40:21.540
Yeah, as a matter of fact.

00:40:21.540 --> 00:40:25.430
I think-- I don't know
how old Zack Snyder is,

00:40:25.430 --> 00:40:27.630
but something happened
in the '90s to comics

00:40:27.630 --> 00:40:31.090
where they became more
extreme and violent.

00:40:31.090 --> 00:40:35.215
And it was all splash pages,
spectacle over storytelling.

00:40:35.215 --> 00:40:37.840
But there's an old saw that the
comics you loved when you're 13

00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:41.916
are the comics that you will
always love, whatever they are.

00:40:41.916 --> 00:40:44.290
And I have a feeling Zack
Snyder read a lot of 90s comics

00:40:44.290 --> 00:40:48.697
because this movie looks like
an Image comic brought to life.

00:40:48.697 --> 00:40:49.530
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:40:49.530 --> 00:40:51.240
GLEN WELDON: Thank you.

00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:52.990
AUDIENCE: It was
interesting what you just

00:40:52.990 --> 00:40:55.760
said about the '90s and the
sort of extreme era of comics.

00:40:55.760 --> 00:40:58.390
It seems that with
Batman he's often

00:40:58.390 --> 00:41:01.430
tonally based by the authors
who are handling him.

00:41:01.430 --> 00:41:04.000
You said this is true
of the movies as well.

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:06.140
And I also noticed it's
sort of a repetitive cycle

00:41:06.140 --> 00:41:10.630
that when he gets too dark, is
when they reintroduce a Robin.

00:41:10.630 --> 00:41:14.810
Do you think it could be
possible for a film Robin

00:41:14.810 --> 00:41:18.695
to come and maybe clean up
the darkness of film Batman?

00:41:18.695 --> 00:41:21.070
GLEN WELDON: When you get a
Robin introduced in the films

00:41:21.070 --> 00:41:23.930
previously, it's by
Joel Schumacher who

00:41:23.930 --> 00:41:27.430
brought in a Robin who
was given to tank tops

00:41:27.430 --> 00:41:30.830
and he had an earring and he
was basically rough trade Robin.

00:41:30.830 --> 00:41:34.120
And that's not necessarily the
way you lighten the film mood.

00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:39.340
That's not the way you
necessarily turn the cycle.

00:41:39.340 --> 00:41:42.310
He goes through this and
he's done it several times

00:41:42.310 --> 00:41:45.090
over the years where he
is the lone vigilante,

00:41:45.090 --> 00:41:47.130
then he is the father
figure to Robin.

00:41:47.130 --> 00:41:49.580
Then he is the leader
of this giant brood.

00:41:49.580 --> 00:41:52.105
And then again, as
you say, they ditch.

00:41:52.105 --> 00:41:53.730
Over and over again
they ditch the kid,

00:41:53.730 --> 00:41:57.560
they ditch the brood to get
him back to grim and gritty.

00:41:57.560 --> 00:42:02.770
You can see in-- there's
a series in the mid-aughts

00:42:02.770 --> 00:42:06.770
into the tens, called "Batman,
the Brave and the Bold"

00:42:06.770 --> 00:42:09.834
which was an animated
series that injected

00:42:09.834 --> 00:42:10.750
a little bit of humor.

00:42:10.750 --> 00:42:15.350
You can see now merch from
the 1966 television series

00:42:15.350 --> 00:42:18.800
after a period of time
when DC Comics wanted

00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:20.730
to pretend like
that never existed

00:42:20.730 --> 00:42:22.129
because they wanted grim.

00:42:22.129 --> 00:42:22.920
They wanted gritty.

00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:24.500
They wanted that
version of Batman

00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:25.940
to be the only
version of Batman.

00:42:25.940 --> 00:42:28.620
Now it wasn't necessarily
because they were afraid of it.

00:42:28.620 --> 00:42:30.870
There's all kinds
of rights issues

00:42:30.870 --> 00:42:33.380
with getting any kind of
imagery from that series.

00:42:33.380 --> 00:42:36.080
Because if you
remember, every episode

00:42:36.080 --> 00:42:37.977
had a guest star,
a guest villain,

00:42:37.977 --> 00:42:40.310
and so they had to get the
rights from the guest villain

00:42:40.310 --> 00:42:42.350
and then work with
their estates.

00:42:42.350 --> 00:42:44.210
And so it just took years.

00:42:44.210 --> 00:42:47.510
But now if you
look around you can

00:42:47.510 --> 00:42:53.590
see some light being injected
back into the whole universe.

00:42:53.590 --> 00:42:55.920
So now as I say the
way it should be

00:42:55.920 --> 00:42:58.590
is that there's a
Batman for everybody.

00:42:58.590 --> 00:42:59.940
Yes?

00:42:59.940 --> 00:43:02.190
AUDIENCE: Yeah, when it comes
to the Christopher Nolan

00:43:02.190 --> 00:43:04.360
trilogy, what is
your biggest concern

00:43:04.360 --> 00:43:07.710
with the whole
surveillance state story?

00:43:07.710 --> 00:43:10.590
And also-- it's a
two-part question--

00:43:10.590 --> 00:43:12.370
from Adam West to
Ben Affleck who

00:43:12.370 --> 00:43:14.690
do you think-- which
Batman had the best chin?

00:43:14.690 --> 00:43:21.650
GLEN WELDON: Ah, see-- there
is a chapter on the chin.

00:43:21.650 --> 00:43:24.720
It actually keeps coming back.

00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:27.331
I kept reading all these
reviews of these films

00:43:27.331 --> 00:43:28.330
as they were coming out.

00:43:28.330 --> 00:43:30.110
And at one point
Roger Ebert says,

00:43:30.110 --> 00:43:32.949
I think Clooney
has the best chin.

00:43:32.949 --> 00:43:33.490
It's a thing.

00:43:33.490 --> 00:43:34.948
Because it's the
only thing you see

00:43:34.948 --> 00:43:36.714
of the character, of the actor.

00:43:36.714 --> 00:43:37.880
It's the only thing you see.

00:43:37.880 --> 00:43:41.160
In the era of Kevlar
suits, you know,

00:43:41.160 --> 00:43:45.240
what the guy's chin-- whether
or not there's a dimple matters.

00:43:45.240 --> 00:43:47.950
Usually because Bob Kane used
to draw him as like-- basically

00:43:47.950 --> 00:43:50.130
Dick Tracy-- square jawed.

00:43:50.130 --> 00:43:54.440
And it's hugely important to
the character in a weird way

00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:55.540
that nerds hold onto.

00:43:55.540 --> 00:43:58.330
I say in the book
that Batman speaks

00:43:58.330 --> 00:44:02.380
to the ideal of masculinity
of every 12-year-old kid who's

00:44:02.380 --> 00:44:04.810
had his lunch money
stolen one too many times.

00:44:04.810 --> 00:44:08.460
Bruce Wayne appeals to the
desire to look great in a tux.

00:44:08.460 --> 00:44:11.570
So you need both.

00:44:11.570 --> 00:44:14.400
As for the surveillance state,
I thought that was interesting.

00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:16.030
I just didn't think
it hung together.

00:44:16.030 --> 00:44:16.870
It makes sense.

00:44:16.870 --> 00:44:18.640
I mean, Batman--
in the comics there

00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:21.190
have been all these stories
about Batman making contingency

00:44:21.190 --> 00:44:23.530
plans, contingency plans,
planning everything out,

00:44:23.530 --> 00:44:25.340
observing everybody,
spying on everybody.

00:44:25.340 --> 00:44:26.756
It makes sense
that this character

00:44:26.756 --> 00:44:29.800
who is paranoid and obsessed
would go down that road.

00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:32.510
It felt, as I said,
like no one was

00:44:32.510 --> 00:44:35.280
sort of drafting
off of a big idea

00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:37.020
and not necessarily
engaging with it.

00:44:37.020 --> 00:44:39.290
I don't think there's
a consistent viewpoint

00:44:39.290 --> 00:44:40.320
about the surveillance
state that you

00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:41.340
can define from that film.

00:44:41.340 --> 00:44:42.380
I don't think there's
a consistent viewpoint

00:44:42.380 --> 00:44:44.505
about terrorism that you
can define from that film.

00:44:44.505 --> 00:44:47.826
It's-- he came to these
big ideas and he said,

00:44:47.826 --> 00:44:48.950
let's do something with it.

00:44:48.950 --> 00:44:50.658
And he did something
with it but it's not

00:44:50.658 --> 00:44:52.720
like it's necessarily
a through line.

00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:55.245
Yes, who's next?

00:44:55.245 --> 00:44:56.870
AUDIENCE: So you
spoke in the beginning

00:44:56.870 --> 00:44:59.507
about there being a lot
of killing in the comics.

00:44:59.507 --> 00:45:01.590
And then they did away
with that for the children.

00:45:01.590 --> 00:45:05.040
And then more recently there's
the principle, never kill.

00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:08.420
Could you speak a bit about
the arc about Batman killing

00:45:08.420 --> 00:45:09.310
versus not killing.

00:45:09.310 --> 00:45:10.900
GLEN WELDON: Sure.

00:45:10.900 --> 00:45:13.220
Yeah, it's been a
part of the character

00:45:13.220 --> 00:45:16.840
since about-- since
after his first year.

00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:20.434
When he mowed people down
with that machine gun,

00:45:20.434 --> 00:45:22.350
they said, no, let's
make sure he never kills.

00:45:22.350 --> 00:45:25.890
And then when
creators of the comic

00:45:25.890 --> 00:45:29.980
want to do something splashy
and make a big impact

00:45:29.980 --> 00:45:32.500
they show him on the
cover with a gun.

00:45:32.500 --> 00:45:36.650
The restraint
against firearms is

00:45:36.650 --> 00:45:40.240
a part of the character, which
is why when I see in the 1989

00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:44.040
Batman film the guns
on the Batmobile,

00:45:44.040 --> 00:45:47.140
when I play Batman
Arkham City and there's

00:45:47.140 --> 00:45:49.250
guns-- rubber
bullets of course--

00:45:49.250 --> 00:45:51.460
but still, there's
guns on the Batmobile,

00:45:51.460 --> 00:45:56.070
like that's a cop
out-- rubber bullets.

00:45:56.070 --> 00:45:59.560
It's something that I think is
hugely important because we're

00:45:59.560 --> 00:46:02.760
not making a story about
an action movie hero.

00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:04.660
When action movie
heroes kill a villain,

00:46:04.660 --> 00:46:07.590
we get this cathartic, yeah!

00:46:07.590 --> 00:46:10.909
That's a big part of the
action movie experience.

00:46:10.909 --> 00:46:13.200
So we don't mind that Charles
Bronson wipes people out.

00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:15.325
We don't mind that Clint
Eastwood wipes people out.

00:46:15.325 --> 00:46:18.330
This guy is dedicated
to preserving life

00:46:18.330 --> 00:46:23.180
and for him to kill is
a fundamental undoing

00:46:23.180 --> 00:46:24.890
of his mission statement.

00:46:24.890 --> 00:46:28.380
He is trying to keep that
trauma or anybody else

00:46:28.380 --> 00:46:31.940
from suffering the trauma
that he suffered as a kid.

00:46:31.940 --> 00:46:32.764
Yes.

00:46:32.764 --> 00:46:35.180
AUDIENCE: Thank you so much
for coming, by the way, really

00:46:35.180 --> 00:46:35.925
appreciate it.

00:46:35.925 --> 00:46:37.300
And in the spirit
of nerding out,

00:46:37.300 --> 00:46:38.841
I have a good question
for you that I

00:46:38.841 --> 00:46:40.710
think is one that's
gone on multiple times

00:46:40.710 --> 00:46:43.116
and many people have asked
over the course of time.

00:46:43.116 --> 00:46:45.270
I'm curious what
your opinion is.

00:46:45.270 --> 00:46:48.915
What is your thought in
regards to who is the mask,

00:46:48.915 --> 00:46:50.545
or is it a mask within a mask?

00:46:50.545 --> 00:46:51.545
Is Bruce Wayne the mask?

00:46:51.545 --> 00:46:52.560
Is Batman the mask?

00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:54.230
Is it actually a
mask within a mask.

00:46:54.230 --> 00:46:55.805
And really in his
inner child he's

00:46:55.805 --> 00:46:59.680
this little fluffy marshmallow
of emotion wanting to be happy.

00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:01.280
So what is your thought on that?

00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:04.110
GLEN WELDON: I was just talking
to [? Sara Beth ?] about this.

00:47:04.110 --> 00:47:08.140
There is an episode of the
animated series where Batman

00:47:08.140 --> 00:47:12.580
has some kind of-- no,
it's "Batman Beyond"

00:47:12.580 --> 00:47:15.050
where Batman is having
some kind of mental trauma.

00:47:15.050 --> 00:47:18.160
And the way he figures out
that he was not going insane

00:47:18.160 --> 00:47:20.990
and that it was
all an illusion was

00:47:20.990 --> 00:47:24.200
because in one of the
versions Batman basically

00:47:24.200 --> 00:47:25.810
calls him Bruce.

00:47:25.810 --> 00:47:29.940
And he says, in my head I
don't call myself Bruce.

00:47:29.940 --> 00:47:32.150
I think anybody who
plays the character is

00:47:32.150 --> 00:47:33.400
playing three versions of him.

00:47:33.400 --> 00:47:37.280
He's playing the Griff,
swear to me, Batman.

00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:43.150
He's playing this kind of
socialite, smarmy jerk.

00:47:43.150 --> 00:47:46.750
And he's playing the
survivor of the trauma

00:47:46.750 --> 00:47:49.304
that he suffered as a
youth, that Bruce Wayne.

00:47:49.304 --> 00:47:51.470
And I think that Bruce Wayne
is as close as you get.

00:47:51.470 --> 00:47:56.410
But I do think Batman is
his reaction to this thing.

00:47:56.410 --> 00:47:59.210
So his true self,
I think, is Batman.

00:47:59.210 --> 00:48:00.354
That's my take.

00:48:00.354 --> 00:48:01.270
AUDIENCE: Interesting.

00:48:01.270 --> 00:48:02.895
I have a completely
unrelated question,

00:48:02.895 --> 00:48:04.700
if everyone's okay with that.

00:48:04.700 --> 00:48:06.920
I'm curious-- you
didn't touch on--

00:48:06.920 --> 00:48:10.530
as we went back to the
death of Jason Todd,

00:48:10.530 --> 00:48:13.340
for example, that was
an impactful thing.

00:48:13.340 --> 00:48:16.347
That was an interesting thing
that was kind of driven by,

00:48:16.347 --> 00:48:18.180
I don't know if I want
to say commercialism.

00:48:18.180 --> 00:48:20.730
But they let people have
a poll to actually make

00:48:20.730 --> 00:48:23.070
a decision on it that
was shockingly close.

00:48:23.070 --> 00:48:25.000
And so I'm curious,
does that play

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:27.650
into what you think of the
development of the character

00:48:27.650 --> 00:48:29.900
and also the development of
the character in the space

00:48:29.900 --> 00:48:31.140
of the commercial world?

00:48:31.140 --> 00:48:32.250
GLEN WELDON: Yes.

00:48:32.250 --> 00:48:36.060
Again, they periodically
throw the kid under the rug--

00:48:36.060 --> 00:48:40.340
literally, six feet under
the rug to get him back

00:48:40.340 --> 00:48:42.517
to basics, to restart.

00:48:42.517 --> 00:48:44.600
In the case of Jason Todd
they couldn't figure out

00:48:44.600 --> 00:48:45.640
how to write him.

00:48:45.640 --> 00:48:49.330
He was an insolent punk
and I voted to kill him.

00:48:49.330 --> 00:48:51.010
I was one of the
thousands of people

00:48:51.010 --> 00:48:56.270
who voted to off the little
kid because he was surly.

00:48:56.270 --> 00:48:58.640
He was a jerk.

00:48:58.640 --> 00:49:02.880
And, yeah, it was a huge event.

00:49:02.880 --> 00:49:05.590
None of them who did that
event-- they ran a poll,

00:49:05.590 --> 00:49:08.680
should we killed Jason Todd
or should we let him live?

00:49:08.680 --> 00:49:09.430
And people voted.

00:49:09.430 --> 00:49:11.970
The margin was only
about 8000 or so people

00:49:11.970 --> 00:49:15.690
voters or something like that,
but the margin was 72 votes.

00:49:15.690 --> 00:49:17.310
One of mine was--
put it over the top.

00:49:20.180 --> 00:49:24.030
And yes, they didn't expect
it to become the big to-do

00:49:24.030 --> 00:49:25.660
that it did.

00:49:25.660 --> 00:49:29.520
They were-- because everybody
within the-- it's kind

00:49:29.520 --> 00:49:31.520
of like what happened
when they killed Superman.

00:49:31.520 --> 00:49:35.070
Everybody in the industry knew
that it was a marketing stunt

00:49:35.070 --> 00:49:39.300
but Newsweek didn't and
The New York Times didn't.

00:49:39.300 --> 00:49:41.910
They thought this was actually
a permanent change because they

00:49:41.910 --> 00:49:43.630
don't know how
superhero comics work,

00:49:43.630 --> 00:49:45.720
where everything comes back.

00:49:45.720 --> 00:49:48.070
And Jason Todd has come back.

00:49:48.070 --> 00:49:52.030
And it's because, again, we
have to keep this story going

00:49:52.030 --> 00:49:55.320
and that means things
like logical sense

00:49:55.320 --> 00:49:56.990
go out the wayside.

00:49:56.990 --> 00:49:57.800
And we just churn.

00:49:57.800 --> 00:50:00.260
It's a constant
churn of character

00:50:00.260 --> 00:50:02.000
and ideas and narrative.

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:07.080
And yeah-- it's-- I
would kill him again.

00:50:07.080 --> 00:50:09.420
AUDIENCE: Thumbs up to that.

00:50:09.420 --> 00:50:11.279
GLEN WELDON: All right,
I think that's it.

00:50:11.279 --> 00:50:13.320
I want to thank you guys
for having me very much.

00:50:13.320 --> 00:50:14.172
I enjoyed it.

00:50:14.172 --> 00:50:15.880
And if you want to
talk to me afterwards,

00:50:15.880 --> 00:50:20.040
I'll be over there signing
books and thanks again.
