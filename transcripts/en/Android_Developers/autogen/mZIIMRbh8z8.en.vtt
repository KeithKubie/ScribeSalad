I'll I'll try to make the most out of
 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.029
I'll I'll try to make the most out of
this session and the session is going to

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039
this session and the session is going to
 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.160
this session and the session is going to
last for 25 minutes and it's going to be

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170
last for 25 minutes and it's going to be
 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.450
last for 25 minutes and it's going to be
recorded so you can watch it later on

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460
recorded so you can watch it later on
 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.729
recorded so you can watch it later on
this is the agenda and then we're just

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739
this is the agenda and then we're just
 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.430
this is the agenda and then we're just
gonna cover some points and I don't have

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440
gonna cover some points and I don't have
 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.680
gonna cover some points and I don't have
the answer to the lifetime value in the

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690
the answer to the lifetime value in the
 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.139
the answer to the lifetime value in the
equation and and let's say that the

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149
equation and and let's say that the
 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.460
equation and and let's say that the
million dollar question which is how we

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470
million dollar question which is how we
 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.920
million dollar question which is how we
make money but I hope that the session

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930
make money but I hope that the session
 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.390
make money but I hope that the session
today will help you to kind of like

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400
today will help you to kind of like
 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.969
today will help you to kind of like
understand this topic and hopefully take

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979
understand this topic and hopefully take
 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.100
understand this topic and hopefully take
some decisions in the future and and

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110
some decisions in the future and and
 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.289
some decisions in the future and and
it's useful for you so the first the

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299
it's useful for you so the first the
 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.480
it's useful for you so the first the
first question is like why LTV and why

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490
first question is like why LTV and why
 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.249
first question is like why LTV and why
everyone is talking about lifetime value

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259
everyone is talking about lifetime value
 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.770
everyone is talking about lifetime value
so I I'm not gonna spend too much time I

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780
so I I'm not gonna spend too much time I
 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.320
so I I'm not gonna spend too much time I
think we all know that these days

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330
think we all know that these days
 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.390
think we all know that these days
everyone is talking about lifetime value

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400
everyone is talking about lifetime value
 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.690
everyone is talking about lifetime value
for a couple of reasons first and well

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700
for a couple of reasons first and well
 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.780
for a couple of reasons first and well
mostly the the technology is enabling to

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790
mostly the the technology is enabling to
 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.270
mostly the the technology is enabling to
track more things and we kind of like

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280
track more things and we kind of like
 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.520
track more things and we kind of like
track much much more more behaviors

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530
track much much more more behaviors
 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.550
track much much more more behaviors
rather than just installs we also see

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560
rather than just installs we also see
 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.880
rather than just installs we also see
that in games analytics then it's

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890
that in games analytics then it's
 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.620
that in games analytics then it's
becoming more relevant and probably you

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630
becoming more relevant and probably you
 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.590
becoming more relevant and probably you
have all data analysts within your your

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600
have all data analysts within your your
 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.710
have all data analysts within your your
team or your company but also like the

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720
team or your company but also like the
 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.109
team or your company but also like the
whole ecosystem that graph over there

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119
whole ecosystem that graph over there
 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.060
whole ecosystem that graph over there
we've seen it a number of times already

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070
we've seen it a number of times already
 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.789
we've seen it a number of times already
where revenues and usage are increasing

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799
where revenues and usage are increasing
 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.539
where revenues and usage are increasing
but install seems to be stagnating or at

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549
but install seems to be stagnating or at
 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.399
but install seems to be stagnating or at
least stabilizing which means that we

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409
least stabilizing which means that we
 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.560
least stabilizing which means that we
need to make more out of our users and

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570
need to make more out of our users and
 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:07.880
need to make more out of our users and
then we need to think about other

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890
then we need to think about other
 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.880
then we need to think about other
metrics maybe metrics that before they

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890
metrics maybe metrics that before they
 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.510
metrics maybe metrics that before they
didn't have so much relevance

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520
didn't have so much relevance
 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.730
didn't have so much relevance
such as like long-term retention dane ID

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:15.740
such as like long-term retention dane ID
 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.460
such as like long-term retention dane ID
or day 180 they become more relevant

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470
or day 180 they become more relevant
 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.000
or day 180 they become more relevant
nowadays and also lifetime value so just

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010
nowadays and also lifetime value so just
 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.760
nowadays and also lifetime value so just
to get on the same page let's think

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770
to get on the same page let's think
 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:26.290
to get on the same page let's think
about like what lifetime value it is

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300
about like what lifetime value it is
 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:27.910
about like what lifetime value it is
because i think we all agree that

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920
because i think we all agree that
 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.560
because i think we all agree that
lifetime value is kind of like the

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:29.570
lifetime value is kind of like the
 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:31.660
lifetime value is kind of like the
expected revenues that our users are

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670
expected revenues that our users are
 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.790
expected revenues that our users are
going to generate in the lifetime of the

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800
going to generate in the lifetime of the
 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.400
going to generate in the lifetime of the
of the game however we do not agree in

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410
of the game however we do not agree in
 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.320
of the game however we do not agree in
many other things for example the way to

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330
many other things for example the way to
 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.720
many other things for example the way to
calculate lifetime value nobody agrees

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730
calculate lifetime value nobody agrees
 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.440
calculate lifetime value nobody agrees
everyone has their own custom way and

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450
everyone has their own custom way and
 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.120
everyone has their own custom way and
probably it's actually right so that's

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130
probably it's actually right so that's
 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:47.350
probably it's actually right so that's
one thing that we need to take into

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360
one thing that we need to take into
 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:48.790
one thing that we need to take into
account when we are talking to someone

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800
account when we are talking to someone
 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.710
account when we are talking to someone
about lifetime value it might be very

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720
about lifetime value it might be very
 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.050
about lifetime value it might be very
different from your calculation a couple

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060
different from your calculation a couple
 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.030
different from your calculation a couple
of other things so for example we have a

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040
of other things so for example we have a
 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.920
of other things so for example we have a
crystal ball illustrating this slide

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930
crystal ball illustrating this slide
 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.690
crystal ball illustrating this slide
which means that we are predicting the

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700
which means that we are predicting the
 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.640
which means that we are predicting the
future and predicting the future means

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650
future and predicting the future means
 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:01.720
future and predicting the future means
that we are not going to be accurate

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730
that we are not going to be accurate
 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.640
that we are not going to be accurate
this is not an accurate science and

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650
this is not an accurate science and
 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.470
this is not an accurate science and
therefore we need to think about in

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480
therefore we need to think about in
 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.300
therefore we need to think about in
terms of like what is my error or

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310
terms of like what is my error or
 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.760
terms of like what is my error or
interval our confidence and therefore

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:09.770
interval our confidence and therefore
 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:11.860
interval our confidence and therefore
what kind of what is going to be the

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870
what kind of what is going to be the
 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.500
what kind of what is going to be the
range of of my lifetime volume and then

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510
range of of my lifetime volume and then
 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.410
range of of my lifetime volume and then
two last things which would be dynamic

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420
two last things which would be dynamic
 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.840
two last things which would be dynamic
metric so my lifetime value changes over

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850
metric so my lifetime value changes over
 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:21.910
metric so my lifetime value changes over
time and this we've seen it not only

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920
time and this we've seen it not only
 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.220
time and this we've seen it not only
with external factors let's imagine that

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230
with external factors let's imagine that
 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:26.650
with external factors let's imagine that
we have a competitor launching a similar

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660
we have a competitor launching a similar
 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:28.330
we have a competitor launching a similar
game and then all of the sudden my users

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340
game and then all of the sudden my users
 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.580
game and then all of the sudden my users
fly but also like internally we can

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590
fly but also like internally we can
 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.860
fly but also like internally we can
affect this lifetime value by I don't

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870
affect this lifetime value by I don't
 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.320
affect this lifetime value by I don't
know releasing new functionalities or

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:35.330
know releasing new functionalities or
 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:37.240
know releasing new functionalities or
new live ops which are going to help to

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250
new live ops which are going to help to
 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.730
new live ops which are going to help to
increase it hopefully and then last one

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:39.740
increase it hopefully and then last one
 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:41.320
increase it hopefully and then last one
is a metric so it doesn't mean that by

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:41.330
is a metric so it doesn't mean that by
 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.180
is a metric so it doesn't mean that by
having a very high lifetime value you're

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190
having a very high lifetime value you're
 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:46.690
having a very high lifetime value you're
gonna have a string a la and competitive

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700
gonna have a string a la and competitive
 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.120
gonna have a string a la and competitive
advantage over the rest and therefore we

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.130
advantage over the rest and therefore we
 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:50.890
advantage over the rest and therefore we
need to think about like this is just a

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900
need to think about like this is just a
 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.920
need to think about like this is just a
useful metric that is gonna help us so

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930
useful metric that is gonna help us so
 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.500
useful metric that is gonna help us so
what are the usages so the first I think

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510
what are the usages so the first I think
 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:58.150
what are the usages so the first I think
it's clear right if we understand the

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160
it's clear right if we understand the
 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.040
it's clear right if we understand the
lifetime value we can understand what

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:00.050
lifetime value we can understand what
 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:01.810
lifetime value we can understand what
are the costs and therefore we can think

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:01.820
are the costs and therefore we can think
 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:03.790
are the costs and therefore we can think
about like what is a profitability for

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:03.800
about like what is a profitability for
 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.340
about like what is a profitability for
every user and this is very much related

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:06.350
every user and this is very much related
 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:08.250
every user and this is very much related
to user acquisition and it's been used

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:08.260
to user acquisition and it's been used
 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.229
to user acquisition and it's been used
most of the times in in terms of like

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:11.239
most of the times in in terms of like
 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:14.260
most of the times in in terms of like
driving campaigns or UAE campaigns where

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:14.270
driving campaigns or UAE campaigns where
 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:17.020
driving campaigns or UAE campaigns where
we actually know how much are we going

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.030
we actually know how much are we going
 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:18.520
we actually know how much are we going
to spend or at least what is our limit

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530
to spend or at least what is our limit
 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:21.940
to spend or at least what is our limit
to for expenditure in campaigns however

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:21.950
to for expenditure in campaigns however
 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:25.240
to for expenditure in campaigns however
two other ideas which my conversations

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250
two other ideas which my conversations
 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:26.629
two other ideas which my conversations
with developers they haven't been

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:26.639
with developers they haven't been
 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:28.580
with developers they haven't been
use that much would be to think about

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590
use that much would be to think about
 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.129
use that much would be to think about
lifetime value also for live ups so when

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:31.139
lifetime value also for live ups so when
 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:32.929
lifetime value also for live ups so when
we release a new functionality or new

00:04:32.929 --> 00:04:32.939
we release a new functionality or new
 

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:34.999
we release a new functionality or new
feature within the game this might have

00:04:34.999 --> 00:04:35.009
feature within the game this might have
 

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:36.890
feature within the game this might have
an impact in engagement but also in

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900
an impact in engagement but also in
 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.439
an impact in engagement but also in
monetization so sometimes we might see

00:04:39.439 --> 00:04:39.449
monetization so sometimes we might see
 

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:41.059
monetization so sometimes we might see
that the increase in ingame in

00:04:41.059 --> 00:04:41.069
that the increase in ingame in
 

00:04:41.069 --> 00:04:43.850
that the increase in ingame in
engagement might offset the increase or

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860
engagement might offset the increase or
 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.269
engagement might offset the increase or
by a decrease in monetization so the net

00:04:46.269 --> 00:04:46.279
by a decrease in monetization so the net
 

00:04:46.279 --> 00:04:49.459
by a decrease in monetization so the net
the net effect of that functionality is

00:04:49.459 --> 00:04:49.469
the net effect of that functionality is
 

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:51.350
the net effect of that functionality is
actually zero for lifetime value so you

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360
actually zero for lifetime value so you
 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.719
actually zero for lifetime value so you
can think about this way also for for

00:04:53.719 --> 00:04:53.729
can think about this way also for for
 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:55.580
can think about this way also for for
pipeline thinking about like new games

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:55.590
pipeline thinking about like new games
 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:57.619

if we start looking at this data from

00:04:57.619 --> 00:04:57.629
if we start looking at this data from
 

00:04:57.629 --> 00:04:58.969
if we start looking at this data from
the very beginning and we have enough

00:04:58.969 --> 00:04:58.979
the very beginning and we have enough
 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:01.519
the very beginning and we have enough
data we can think about like a method or

00:05:01.519 --> 00:05:01.529
data we can think about like a method or
 

00:05:01.529 --> 00:05:04.459

taking into consideration these this

00:05:04.459 --> 00:05:04.469
taking into consideration these this
 

00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:09.050
taking into consideration these this
metric by deciding a game so once we

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.060
metric by deciding a game so once we
 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:11.059
metric by deciding a game so once we
have these what I've done is to classify

00:05:11.059 --> 00:05:11.069
have these what I've done is to classify
 

00:05:11.069 --> 00:05:14.300
have these what I've done is to classify
I spoke and I'm talking about popular

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:14.310
I spoke and I'm talking about popular
 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:17.600
I spoke and I'm talking about popular
ways here because I spoke to many of you

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:17.610
ways here because I spoke to many of you
 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:19.219
ways here because I spoke to many of you
actually we're sitting here and I want

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:19.229
actually we're sitting here and I want
 

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:21.200
actually we're sitting here and I want
to thank at this point like for

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:21.210
to thank at this point like for
 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:23.119
to thank at this point like for
participating in these interviews that I

00:05:23.119 --> 00:05:23.129
participating in these interviews that I
 

00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:25.700
participating in these interviews that I
run for the last couple of months and

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:25.710
run for the last couple of months and
 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:27.920
run for the last couple of months and
basically I was asking like developers

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:27.930
basically I was asking like developers
 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:30.350
basically I was asking like developers
we are working in a regular basis what

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:30.360
we are working in a regular basis what
 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:31.730
we are working in a regular basis what
are the ways that they are calculating

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:31.740
are the ways that they are calculating
 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.249
are the ways that they are calculating
lifetime value and what we're going to

00:05:34.249 --> 00:05:34.259
lifetime value and what we're going to
 

00:05:34.259 --> 00:05:36.379
lifetime value and what we're going to
do is just like basically classify these

00:05:36.379 --> 00:05:36.389
do is just like basically classify these
 

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:39.140
do is just like basically classify these
ways share some of these insights that

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:39.150
ways share some of these insights that
 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:41.240
ways share some of these insights that
you basically share with us and try to

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:41.250
you basically share with us and try to
 

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:43.339
you basically share with us and try to
figure out like which ways might be more

00:05:43.339 --> 00:05:43.349
figure out like which ways might be more
 

00:05:43.349 --> 00:05:45.439
figure out like which ways might be more
relevant or more interesting for your

00:05:45.439 --> 00:05:45.449
relevant or more interesting for your
 

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:49.670
relevant or more interesting for your
actual game so the first thing is like

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:49.680
actual game so the first thing is like
 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:51.800
actual game so the first thing is like
one common thing that we see in the

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:51.810
one common thing that we see in the
 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:53.529
one common thing that we see in the
lifetime value is that either we are

00:05:53.529 --> 00:05:53.539
lifetime value is that either we are
 

00:05:53.539 --> 00:05:56.600
lifetime value is that either we are
talking about retention or like lifetime

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:56.610
talking about retention or like lifetime
 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:58.519
talking about retention or like lifetime
a lifetime variable or we are talking

00:05:58.519 --> 00:05:58.529
a lifetime variable or we are talking
 

00:05:58.529 --> 00:06:00.529
a lifetime variable or we are talking
about a monetization variable in this

00:06:00.529 --> 00:06:00.539
about a monetization variable in this
 

00:06:00.539 --> 00:06:03.139
about a monetization variable in this
case but when it comes to life can we

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:03.149
case but when it comes to life can we
 

00:06:03.149 --> 00:06:05.809
case but when it comes to life can we
again do not agree because if you think

00:06:05.809 --> 00:06:05.819
again do not agree because if you think
 

00:06:05.819 --> 00:06:08.480
again do not agree because if you think
about retention many of you might take

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:08.490
about retention many of you might take
 

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:10.579
about retention many of you might take
retention has the classic retention

00:06:10.579 --> 00:06:10.589
retention has the classic retention
 

00:06:10.589 --> 00:06:11.119
retention has the classic retention
right

00:06:11.119 --> 00:06:11.129
right
 

00:06:11.129 --> 00:06:13.100
right
however some developers they were

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:13.110
however some developers they were
 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:14.389
however some developers they were
talking to me and the saying like well

00:06:14.389 --> 00:06:14.399
talking to me and the saying like well
 

00:06:14.399 --> 00:06:16.760
talking to me and the saying like well
in my game it makes more sense to

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:16.770
in my game it makes more sense to
 

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:18.649
in my game it makes more sense to
consider rolling retention or range

00:06:18.649 --> 00:06:18.659
consider rolling retention or range
 

00:06:18.659 --> 00:06:20.300
consider rolling retention or range
retentions because there are episodes

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:20.310
retentions because there are episodes

arleigh why in a casual game it might

00:06:27.829 --> 00:06:27.839
arleigh why in a casual game it might
 

00:06:27.839 --> 00:06:29.990
arleigh why in a casual game it might
not make sense actually to look at daily

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:30.000
not make sense actually to look at daily
 

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.820
not make sense actually to look at daily
retention but hourly retention because

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:31.830
retention but hourly retention because

00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:57.890
also how do you calculate the ARB Dow is
 

00:06:57.890 --> 00:06:59.080
also how do you calculate the ARB Dow is
gonna make a difference

00:06:59.080 --> 00:06:59.090
gonna make a difference
 

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:01.150
gonna make a difference
am i taking the last week or the last

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:01.160
am i taking the last week or the last
 

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:03.010
am i taking the last week or the last
three months because it might have a

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:03.020
three months because it might have a
 

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:05.410
three months because it might have a
difference so when I am talking to

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:05.420
difference so when I am talking to
 

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:07.180
difference so when I am talking to
developers and I'm asking them about

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:07.190
developers and I'm asking them about
 

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:09.130
developers and I'm asking them about
like lifetime value I'm gonna have all

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:09.140
like lifetime value I'm gonna have all
 

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:11.050
like lifetime value I'm gonna have all
these things into consideration and it

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:11.060
these things into consideration and it
 

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:12.310
these things into consideration and it
would be interesting for you to think

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:12.320
would be interesting for you to think
 

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:15.340
would be interesting for you to think
before you are calculating it another

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:15.350
before you are calculating it another
 

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:17.560
before you are calculating it another
common thing that most developers have

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:17.570
common thing that most developers have
 

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:19.720
common thing that most developers have
is the period and this is interesting

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:19.730
is the period and this is interesting
 

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:21.520
is the period and this is interesting
because like it depends a lot

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:21.530
because like it depends a lot
 

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:23.710
because like it depends a lot
independently in a couple of metrics how

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:23.720
independently in a couple of metrics how
 

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:25.270
independently in a couple of metrics how
are we going to calculate the period

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:25.280
are we going to calculate the period
 

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:27.130
are we going to calculate the period
like the lifetime value is it going to

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:27.140
like the lifetime value is it going to
 

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:30.790
like the lifetime value is it going to
be 4 90 180 days 1 year or even like 5

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:30.800
be 4 90 180 days 1 year or even like 5
 

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:33.130
be 4 90 180 days 1 year or even like 5
years it might depend a lot in some key

00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:33.140
years it might depend a lot in some key
 

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:35.560
years it might depend a lot in some key
factors so out of those conversations we

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:35.570
factors so out of those conversations we
 

00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:37.660
factors so out of those conversations we
realize that things like for example

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:37.670
realize that things like for example
 

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:39.670
realize that things like for example
type of the game which are make make

00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:39.680
type of the game which are make make
 

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:42.070
type of the game which are make make
sense like if it is a hardcore or casual

00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:42.080
sense like if it is a hardcore or casual
 

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:43.960
sense like if it is a hardcore or casual
I might like to look at longer lifetime

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:43.970
I might like to look at longer lifetime
 

00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:45.790
I might like to look at longer lifetime
values if it is a hardcore game the

00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:45.800
values if it is a hardcore game the
 

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:47.590
values if it is a hardcore game the
business model that I'm using the state

00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:47.600
business model that I'm using the state
 

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:49.870
business model that I'm using the state
of the company and it all comes down to

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:49.880
of the company and it all comes down to
 

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:52.750
of the company and it all comes down to
the funding so do I need to recover the

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:52.760
the funding so do I need to recover the
 

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:55.720
the funding so do I need to recover the
investment in 90 days or do I need to

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:55.730
investment in 90 days or do I need to
 

00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:59.290
investment in 90 days or do I need to
recover it in maybe 365 so these things

00:07:59.290 --> 00:07:59.300
recover it in maybe 365 so these things
 

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:02.020
recover it in maybe 365 so these things
are also quite interesting because every

00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:02.030
are also quite interesting because every
 

00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:03.700
are also quite interesting because every
company they calculated in a different

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:03.710
company they calculated in a different
 

00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:06.070
company they calculated in a different
way depending on some of these aspects

00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:06.080
way depending on some of these aspects
 

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:08.440
way depending on some of these aspects
there are more aspects by the way but

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:08.450
there are more aspects by the way but
 

00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:10.210
there are more aspects by the way but
these are the ones that I just wanted to

00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:10.220
these are the ones that I just wanted to
 

00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:13.990
these are the ones that I just wanted to
highlight so let's think about then how

00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:14.000
highlight so let's think about then how
 

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.690
highlight so let's think about then how
we classify all the ways that developers

00:08:16.690 --> 00:08:16.700
we classify all the ways that developers
 

00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:18.790
we classify all the ways that developers
nowadays are estimating lifetime value

00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:18.800
nowadays are estimating lifetime value
 

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:21.730
nowadays are estimating lifetime value
so I just put an axis there on the on

00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:21.740
so I just put an axis there on the on
 

00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:23.920
so I just put an axis there on the on
the Left axis complexity and then

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:23.930
the Left axis complexity and then
 

00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:25.840
the Left axis complexity and then
accuracy because I'm assuming that the

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:25.850
accuracy because I'm assuming that the
 

00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:27.790
accuracy because I'm assuming that the
more complex you go the more accurate

00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:27.800
more complex you go the more accurate
 

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:29.800
more complex you go the more accurate
your gonna be that's a priori because we

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:29.810
your gonna be that's a priori because we
 

00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:32.260
your gonna be that's a priori because we
can see that sometimes you can go as

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:32.270
can see that sometimes you can go as
 

00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:34.360
can see that sometimes you can go as
complex as you want and the accuracy

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:34.370
complex as you want and the accuracy
 

00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:36.070
complex as you want and the accuracy
might not increase but let's let's

00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:36.080
might not increase but let's let's
 

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:38.560
might not increase but let's let's
assume that the first one would be very

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:38.570
assume that the first one would be very
 

00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:40.750
assume that the first one would be very
simple historical averages or benchmarks

00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:40.760
simple historical averages or benchmarks
 

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:42.430
simple historical averages or benchmarks
that could be an easy way to estimate

00:08:42.430 --> 00:08:42.440
that could be an easy way to estimate
 

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:44.950
that could be an easy way to estimate
called lifetime value then we will see

00:08:44.950 --> 00:08:44.960
called lifetime value then we will see
 

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:47.680
called lifetime value then we will see
simple predictive models a little bit

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:47.690
simple predictive models a little bit
 

00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:49.930
simple predictive models a little bit
more advanced predictive models and then

00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:49.940
more advanced predictive models and then
 

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:52.510
more advanced predictive models and then
well the super hyper advanced predictive

00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:52.520
well the super hyper advanced predictive
 

00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:53.620
well the super hyper advanced predictive
models I'm not

00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:53.630
models I'm not
 

00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:55.440
models I'm not
cover them because they're usually

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:55.450
cover them because they're usually
 

00:08:55.450 --> 00:08:57.910
cover them because they're usually
involving like behavioral patterns they

00:08:57.910 --> 00:08:57.920
involving like behavioral patterns they
 

00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:00.130
involving like behavioral patterns they
are involving like specific things to

00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:00.140
are involving like specific things to
 

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:02.350
are involving like specific things to
the game so if we look at the three

00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:02.360
the game so if we look at the three
 

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:04.840
the game so if we look at the three
first models the first one is quite easy

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:04.850
first models the first one is quite easy
 

00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:07.330
first models the first one is quite easy
and talking to you we are not even

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:07.340
and talking to you we are not even
 

00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:09.280
and talking to you we are not even
looking at predictive we are looking at

00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:09.290
looking at predictive we are looking at
 

00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:12.040
looking at predictive we are looking at
just looking at our historical data if

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:12.050
just looking at our historical data if
 

00:09:12.050 --> 00:09:13.720
just looking at our historical data if
we have the data and maybe just

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:13.730
we have the data and maybe just
 

00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:15.810
we have the data and maybe just
assessing like the are pool of the last

00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:15.820
assessing like the are pool of the last
 

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:18.490
assessing like the are pool of the last
180 days if my game has been released

00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:18.500
180 days if my game has been released
 

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:22.600
180 days if my game has been released
six months ago was X amount and I can

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:22.610
six months ago was X amount and I can
 

00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:24.880
six months ago was X amount and I can
basically estimate with a new user at

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:24.890
basically estimate with a new user at
 

00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:27.640
basically estimate with a new user at
day three is generating 70% and then I

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:27.650
day three is generating 70% and then I
 

00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:29.800
day three is generating 70% and then I
will just project and 100% would be a

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:29.810
will just project and 100% would be a
 

00:09:29.810 --> 00:09:34.300
will just project and 100% would be a
day 180 that's very simple and to be

00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:34.310
day 180 that's very simple and to be
 

00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:36.550
day 180 that's very simple and to be
honest has some pros which is like very

00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:36.560
honest has some pros which is like very
 

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:39.880
honest has some pros which is like very
easy to estimate it has also some like

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:39.890
easy to estimate it has also some like
 

00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:41.530
easy to estimate it has also some like
well enables quick decisions at very

00:09:41.530 --> 00:09:41.540
well enables quick decisions at very
 

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:43.720
well enables quick decisions at very
early stages but on the other hand is

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:43.730
early stages but on the other hand is
 

00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:46.180
early stages but on the other hand is
very it's not very precise and the

00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:46.190
very it's not very precise and the
 

00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:48.580
very it's not very precise and the
averages might kind of like buy us these

00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:48.590
averages might kind of like buy us these
 

00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:51.010
averages might kind of like buy us these
results by the way if you don't have

00:09:51.010 --> 00:09:51.020
results by the way if you don't have
 

00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:53.020
results by the way if you don't have
data most of developers what they're

00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:53.030
data most of developers what they're
 

00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:54.790
data most of developers what they're
doing then it's looking at like

00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:54.800
doing then it's looking at like
 

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:57.130
doing then it's looking at like
benchmarks or maybe similar games that

00:09:57.130 --> 00:09:57.140
benchmarks or maybe similar games that
 

00:09:57.140 --> 00:09:58.840
benchmarks or maybe similar games that
you have in your portfolio and then you

00:09:58.840 --> 00:09:58.850
you have in your portfolio and then you
 

00:09:58.850 --> 00:10:00.460
you have in your portfolio and then you
say like well in my previous game

00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:00.470
say like well in my previous game
 

00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:04.810
say like well in my previous game
I was generating X amount so what is the

00:10:04.810 --> 00:10:04.820
I was generating X amount so what is the
 

00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:06.820
I was generating X amount so what is the
simple predictive so when we talk about

00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:06.830
simple predictive so when we talk about
 

00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:08.830
simple predictive so when we talk about
simple predictive models we we see both

00:10:08.830 --> 00:10:08.840
simple predictive models we we see both
 

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:12.670
simple predictive models we we see both
two models which are quite used the

00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:12.680
two models which are quite used the
 

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:14.440
two models which are quite used the
first one is the the kind of like the

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:14.450
first one is the the kind of like the
 

00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:15.880
first one is the the kind of like the
top-down because we are looking at all

00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:15.890
top-down because we are looking at all
 

00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:17.800
top-down because we are looking at all
users and then we are just going to

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:17.810
users and then we are just going to
 

00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:19.780
users and then we are just going to
estimate the lifetime value with this

00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:19.790
estimate the lifetime value with this
 

00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:21.910
estimate the lifetime value with this
formula you probably seen it away like

00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:21.920
formula you probably seen it away like
 

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:24.490
formula you probably seen it away like
in some places and we are projecting the

00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:24.500
in some places and we are projecting the
 

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:26.050
in some places and we are projecting the
retention which is the typical cube

00:10:26.050 --> 00:10:26.060
retention which is the typical cube
 

00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:28.420
retention which is the typical cube
survival cube and then we look at like

00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:28.430
survival cube and then we look at like
 

00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:30.340
survival cube and then we look at like
well at a hundred and eighty in this

00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:30.350
well at a hundred and eighty in this
 

00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:33.250
well at a hundred and eighty in this
case the retention is only 5% so on

00:10:33.250 --> 00:10:33.260
case the retention is only 5% so on
 

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.980
case the retention is only 5% so on
average nine days per user are going to

00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:35.990
average nine days per user are going to
 

00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:38.200
average nine days per user are going to
use my lap if I multiply this by they

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:38.210
use my lap if I multiply this by they
 

00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:40.320
use my lap if I multiply this by they
are tau then I can have in this case

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:40.330
are tau then I can have in this case
 

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:43.480
are tau then I can have in this case
0.45 dollars would be the retention they

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:43.490
0.45 dollars would be the retention they
 

00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:45.280
0.45 dollars would be the retention they
lifetime value expectation for this for

couple of pros relatively easy to

00:10:50.170 --> 00:10:50.180
couple of pros relatively easy to
 

00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:51.280
couple of pros relatively easy to
calculate there's a number of

spreadsheets online that you can
 

00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:55.630
spreadsheets online that you can
download and then the cons are is not

download and then the cons are is not
 

00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:57.130
download and then the cons are is not
very accurate again because we are

00:10:57.130 --> 00:10:57.140
very accurate again because we are
 

00:10:57.140 --> 00:11:00.600
very accurate again because we are
taking segments and it depends like from

the retention might change

00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:06.800
the retention might change
 

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:09.460
the retention might change
quite drastically and then last one up

only at pain users this is a the bottoms

00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:26.630
only at pain users this is a the bottoms
 

00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:29.769
only at pain users this is a the bottoms
of model which is kind of like some

00:11:29.769 --> 00:11:29.779
of model which is kind of like some
 

00:11:29.779 --> 00:11:31.389

model that also many developers are
 

00:11:31.399 --> 00:11:32.800
model that also many developers are
looking at and it's basically projecting

paying users in this case we use a curve

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:37.370
paying users in this case we use a curve
 

00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:39.340
paying users in this case we use a curve
which is a logarithmic one and we can

00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:39.350
which is a logarithmic one and we can
 

00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:41.949
which is a logarithmic one and we can
project very similar case that at day

couple of pros in this case so again

00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:57.230
couple of pros in this case so again
 

00:11:57.230 --> 00:12:00.100
couple of pros in this case so again
relatively easy to calculate and we have

00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:00.110
relatively easy to calculate and we have
 

00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:02.019
relatively easy to calculate and we have
also that usually the number the

00:12:02.019 --> 00:12:02.029
also that usually the number the
 

00:12:02.029 --> 00:12:03.880
also that usually the number the
percentage of conversions is relatively

00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:03.890
percentage of conversions is relatively
 

00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:05.590
percentage of conversions is relatively
stable and we can see that it's going to

00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:05.600
stable and we can see that it's going to
 

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:09.519
stable and we can see that it's going to
be like 1.5 or 2% of users pain and the

00:12:09.519 --> 00:12:09.529
be like 1.5 or 2% of users pain and the
 

00:12:09.529 --> 00:12:11.860
be like 1.5 or 2% of users pain and the
cons is usually this this model what I

00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:11.870
cons is usually this this model what I
 

00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:13.900
cons is usually this this model what I
heard is that it works well when you

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:13.910
heard is that it works well when you
 

00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:15.250
heard is that it works well when you
have a game that most of the

00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:15.260
have a game that most of the
 

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:17.740
have a game that most of the
monetization camera comes up front but

00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:17.750
monetization camera comes up front but
 

00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:19.600
monetization camera comes up front but
some of the hardcore games or strategy

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:19.610
some of the hardcore games or strategy
 

00:12:19.610 --> 00:12:21.430
some of the hardcore games or strategy
games that you might have like longer

00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:21.440
games that you might have like longer
 

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:23.050
games that you might have like longer

later that cure might be difficult to
 

00:12:25.250 --> 00:12:27.970
later that cure might be difficult to
fit so let's move to the advanced

00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:27.980
fit so let's move to the advanced
 

00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:30.490
fit so let's move to the advanced
predictive models so what means advanced

00:12:30.490 --> 00:12:30.500
predictive models so what means advanced
 

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:32.920
predictive models so what means advanced
well notice that the the crystal ball is

00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:32.930
well notice that the the crystal ball is
 

00:12:32.930 --> 00:12:35.230
well notice that the the crystal ball is
getting more sophisticated we're using

00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:35.240
getting more sophisticated we're using
 

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:37.389
getting more sophisticated we're using
like historical data and we are trying

00:12:37.389 --> 00:12:37.399
like historical data and we are trying
 

00:12:37.399 --> 00:12:39.670
like historical data and we are trying
to predict individual lifetime value at

00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:39.680
to predict individual lifetime value at
 

00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:43.120
to predict individual lifetime value at
a in a probabilistic way so has some

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:43.130
a in a probabilistic way so has some
 

00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:45.880
a in a probabilistic way so has some
pros and cons in this case to oops

00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:45.890
pros and cons in this case to oops
 

00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:48.460
pros and cons in this case to oops
so the first one is obviously like we

00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:48.470
so the first one is obviously like we
 

00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:50.260
so the first one is obviously like we
kind of like get an estimate at an

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:50.270
kind of like get an estimate at an
 

00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:51.819
kind of like get an estimate at an
individual level which is very useful

00:12:51.819 --> 00:12:51.829
individual level which is very useful
 

00:12:51.829 --> 00:12:54.760
individual level which is very useful
it's usually more accurate and the cons

00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:54.770
it's usually more accurate and the cons
 

00:12:54.770 --> 00:12:56.590
it's usually more accurate and the cons
are we need the second extensive user

00:12:56.590 --> 00:12:56.600
are we need the second extensive user
 

00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:58.750
are we need the second extensive user
data and especially we need to have the

00:12:58.750 --> 00:12:58.760
data and especially we need to have the
 

00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:00.150
data and especially we need to have the
resources and capabilities to

00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:00.160
resources and capabilities to
 

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:02.500
resources and capabilities to
interpretate this data and execute based

00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:02.510
interpretate this data and execute based
 

00:13:02.510 --> 00:13:04.990
interpretate this data and execute based
on this insight which is very

00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:05.000
on this insight which is very
 

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.600
on this insight which is very
interesting so and why do we need like

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:07.610
interesting so and why do we need like
 

00:13:07.610 --> 00:13:09.759
interesting so and why do we need like
predictive models well let me just

00:13:09.759 --> 00:13:09.769
predictive models well let me just
 

00:13:09.769 --> 00:13:12.610
predictive models well let me just
illustrate with with a very very simple

00:13:12.610 --> 00:13:12.620
illustrate with with a very very simple
 

00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:14.590
illustrate with with a very very simple
example we have two users download they

00:13:14.590 --> 00:13:14.600
example we have two users download they
 

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:16.360
example we have two users download they
are both of them have sunglasses but

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:16.370
are both of them have sunglasses but
 

00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:18.550
are both of them have sunglasses but
doesn't it's not any related in any way

00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:18.560
doesn't it's not any related in any way
 

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:20.500
doesn't it's not any related in any way
and they start like buying sand

00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:20.510
and they start like buying sand
 

00:13:20.510 --> 00:13:23.200
and they start like buying sand
so you can see like Rick is a heavy

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:23.210
so you can see like Rick is a heavy
 

00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:26.380
so you can see like Rick is a heavy
buyer and then Gavi it is like a more

00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:26.390
buyer and then Gavi it is like a more
 

00:13:26.390 --> 00:13:30.370
buyer and then Gavi it is like a more
constant but less purchases so if we

00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:30.380
constant but less purchases so if we
 

00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:32.260
constant but less purchases so if we
look at certain models or if we look at

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:32.270
look at certain models or if we look at
 

00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:34.930
look at certain models or if we look at
the past we can think that Rick at this

00:13:34.930 --> 00:13:34.940
the past we can think that Rick at this
 

00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:37.630
the past we can think that Rick at this
stage if you look at forward 280 days

00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:37.640
stage if you look at forward 280 days
 

00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:39.730
stage if you look at forward 280 days
would be more valuable than Gavi however

00:13:39.730 --> 00:13:39.740
would be more valuable than Gavi however
 

00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:41.620
would be more valuable than Gavi however
many of these probabilistic models tell

00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:41.630
many of these probabilistic models tell
 

00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:45.370
many of these probabilistic models tell
us that indeed gabby is more likely to

00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:45.380
us that indeed gabby is more likely to
 

00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:48.700
us that indeed gabby is more likely to
make a purchase and okay you might not

00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:48.710
make a purchase and okay you might not
 

00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:51.340
make a purchase and okay you might not
like why is that and how is that how do

00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:51.350
like why is that and how is that how do
 

00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:53.620
like why is that and how is that how do
we do that well I'm not gonna like talk

00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:53.630
we do that well I'm not gonna like talk
 

00:13:53.630 --> 00:13:55.180
we do that well I'm not gonna like talk
about any model in particular but I'm

00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:55.190
about any model in particular but I'm
 

00:13:55.190 --> 00:13:57.310
about any model in particular but I'm
sorry I'm going to talk about one model

00:13:57.310 --> 00:13:57.320
sorry I'm going to talk about one model
 

00:13:57.320 --> 00:13:58.900
sorry I'm going to talk about one model
in particular I'm not going to recommend

00:13:58.900 --> 00:13:58.910
in particular I'm not going to recommend
 

00:13:58.910 --> 00:14:02.710
in particular I'm not going to recommend
it because I'm not getting any any it's

00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:04.660
it because I'm not getting any any it's
an open source model but this is one

00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:04.670
an open source model but this is one
 

00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:06.250
an open source model but this is one
model that we are actually looking here

00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:06.260
model that we are actually looking here
 

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:08.410
model that we are actually looking here
at Google many times it's called a buy

00:14:08.410 --> 00:14:08.420
at Google many times it's called a buy
 

00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:11.170
at Google many times it's called a buy
TDD model it's open source it's backed

00:14:11.170 --> 00:14:11.180
TDD model it's open source it's backed
 

00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:13.530
TDD model it's open source it's backed
by academia and buy some Wharton

00:14:13.530 --> 00:14:13.540
by academia and buy some Wharton
 

00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:15.850
by academia and buy some Wharton
researchers it's based on these two

00:14:15.850 --> 00:14:15.860
researchers it's based on these two
 

00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:17.440
researchers it's based on these two
models which is the pareto in MIDI and

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:17.450
models which is the pareto in MIDI and
 

00:14:17.450 --> 00:14:20.260
models which is the pareto in MIDI and
the busy Nvidia model and I kind of like

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:20.270
the busy Nvidia model and I kind of like
 

00:14:20.270 --> 00:14:22.360
the busy Nvidia model and I kind of like
I recommend you to have a look because

00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:22.370
I recommend you to have a look because
 

00:14:22.370 --> 00:14:25.450
I recommend you to have a look because
it's quite simple and it's mighty might

00:14:25.450 --> 00:14:25.460
it's quite simple and it's mighty might
 

00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:27.100
it's quite simple and it's mighty might
help you in this if you're thinking

00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:27.110
help you in this if you're thinking
 

00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:28.990
help you in this if you're thinking
about like a predictive model so it's

00:14:28.990 --> 00:14:29.000
about like a predictive model so it's
 

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.180
about like a predictive model so it's
based on two sub models one is actually

00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:31.190
based on two sub models one is actually
 

00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:33.430
based on two sub models one is actually
looking at the likelihood of making a

00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:33.440
looking at the likelihood of making a
 

00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:35.110
looking at the likelihood of making a
transaction and the other one would be

00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:35.120
transaction and the other one would be
 

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:36.970
transaction and the other one would be
looking at the value like what is going

00:14:36.970 --> 00:14:36.980
looking at the value like what is going
 

00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:39.460
looking at the value like what is going
to be the feature average or the value

00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:39.470
to be the feature average or the value
 

00:14:39.470 --> 00:14:43.600
to be the feature average or the value
of those transactions so just to

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:43.610
of those transactions so just to
 

00:14:43.610 --> 00:14:45.850
of those transactions so just to
illustrate how it works I'm gonna use

00:14:45.850 --> 00:14:45.860
illustrate how it works I'm gonna use
 

00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:48.340
illustrate how it works I'm gonna use
the same example so we have Rick Rick

00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:48.350
the same example so we have Rick Rick
 

00:14:48.350 --> 00:14:50.830
the same example so we have Rick Rick
bought a lot of times and the likelihood

00:14:50.830 --> 00:14:50.840
bought a lot of times and the likelihood
 

00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:52.870
bought a lot of times and the likelihood
of making a transaction is based on two

00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:52.880
of making a transaction is based on two
 

00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:55.570
of making a transaction is based on two
variables which is recency so we are

00:14:55.570 --> 00:14:55.580
variables which is recency so we are
 

00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:58.630
variables which is recency so we are
assuming that the most recent that you

00:14:58.630 --> 00:14:58.640
assuming that the most recent that you
 

00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:00.550
assuming that the most recent that you
did a transaction is the more likely

00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:00.560
did a transaction is the more likely
 

00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:01.960
did a transaction is the more likely
that you're gonna make another one and

00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:01.970
that you're gonna make another one and
 

00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:04.000
that you're gonna make another one and
then the frequency which is like how

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:04.010
then the frequency which is like how
 

00:15:04.010 --> 00:15:05.890
then the frequency which is like how
many times did you buy so we're assuming

00:15:05.890 --> 00:15:05.900
many times did you buy so we're assuming
 

00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:07.930
many times did you buy so we're assuming
basically that I use it that buys a lot

00:15:07.930 --> 00:15:07.940
basically that I use it that buys a lot
 

00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:10.600
basically that I use it that buys a lot
during a long period of time it's going

00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:10.610
during a long period of time it's going
 

00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:12.250
during a long period of time it's going
to be more likely that it's going to buy

00:15:12.250 --> 00:15:12.260
to be more likely that it's going to buy
 

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:15.880
to be more likely that it's going to buy
again so Rick bought a lot but only very

00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:15.890
again so Rick bought a lot but only very
 

00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:18.100
again so Rick bought a lot but only very
like in the first five days which means

00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:18.110
like in the first five days which means
 

00:15:18.110 --> 00:15:20.440
like in the first five days which means
that then he's probably very like you

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:20.450
that then he's probably very like you
 

00:15:20.450 --> 00:15:22.630
that then he's probably very like you
could see the colors and is in the dark

00:15:22.630 --> 00:15:22.640
could see the colors and is in the dark
 

00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:24.670
could see the colors and is in the dark
dark blue which means like very likely

00:15:24.670 --> 00:15:24.680
dark blue which means like very likely
 

00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:27.580
dark blue which means like very likely
he's not going to buy again however we

00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:27.590
he's not going to buy again however we
 

00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:30.190
he's not going to buy again however we
look at Gaby she bought very very little

00:15:30.190 --> 00:15:30.200
look at Gaby she bought very very little
 

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:33.400
look at Gaby she bought very very little
and then we can see that in this case

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:33.410
and then we can see that in this case
 

00:15:33.410 --> 00:15:34.269
and then we can see that in this case
like the light

00:15:34.269 --> 00:15:34.279
like the light
 

00:15:34.279 --> 00:15:36.340
like the light
of mine and this is again this is a

00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:36.350
of mine and this is again this is a
 

00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:39.300
of mine and this is again this is a
model that is done based on research and

00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:39.310
model that is done based on research and
 

00:15:39.310 --> 00:15:41.829
model that is done based on research and
empirically also we can see that she's

00:15:41.829 --> 00:15:41.839
empirically also we can see that she's
 

00:15:41.839 --> 00:15:44.350
empirically also we can see that she's
also by she's gonna be more likely to

00:15:44.350 --> 00:15:44.360
also by she's gonna be more likely to
 

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:47.710
also by she's gonna be more likely to
buy so what can we get out of these type

00:15:47.710 --> 00:15:47.720
buy so what can we get out of these type
 

00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:50.259
buy so what can we get out of these type
of models so most of the times we get

00:15:50.259 --> 00:15:50.269
of models so most of the times we get
 

00:15:50.269 --> 00:15:52.090
of models so most of the times we get
like first the probability of being

00:15:52.090 --> 00:15:52.100
like first the probability of being
 

00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:53.980
like first the probability of being
alive so at a certain point of time

00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:53.990
alive so at a certain point of time
 

00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:56.110
alive so at a certain point of time
looking forward we can see like okay

00:15:56.110 --> 00:15:56.120
looking forward we can see like okay
 

00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:58.749
looking forward we can see like okay
this user is going to buy again or not

00:15:58.749 --> 00:15:58.759
this user is going to buy again or not
 

00:15:58.759 --> 00:16:01.420
this user is going to buy again or not
so the number of transactions that this

00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:01.430
so the number of transactions that this
 

00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:04.239
so the number of transactions that this
person is going to make this user the

00:16:04.239 --> 00:16:04.249
person is going to make this user the
 

00:16:04.249 --> 00:16:06.189
person is going to make this user the
expected average or the values for how

00:16:06.189 --> 00:16:06.199
expected average or the values for how
 

00:16:06.199 --> 00:16:08.499
expected average or the values for how
much is going to spend and finally the

00:16:08.499 --> 00:16:08.509
much is going to spend and finally the
 

00:16:08.509 --> 00:16:10.299
much is going to spend and finally the
expected user LTV which is in the end

00:16:10.299 --> 00:16:10.309
expected user LTV which is in the end
 

00:16:10.309 --> 00:16:12.220
expected user LTV which is in the end
it's the product of all the other things

00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:12.230
it's the product of all the other things
 

00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:15.400
it's the product of all the other things
so just taking this model as an example

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:15.410
so just taking this model as an example
 

00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:17.850
so just taking this model as an example
what would be the pros and the cons so

00:16:17.850 --> 00:16:17.860
what would be the pros and the cons so
 

00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:21.579
what would be the pros and the cons so
first the pros again we have individual

00:16:21.579 --> 00:16:21.589
first the pros again we have individual
 

00:16:21.589 --> 00:16:23.650
first the pros again we have individual
lifetime value which is interesting it's

00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:23.660
lifetime value which is interesting it's
 

00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:25.929
lifetime value which is interesting it's
open source you can download the the the

00:16:25.929 --> 00:16:25.939
open source you can download the the the
 

00:16:25.939 --> 00:16:28.749
open source you can download the the the
Python apk practic it and you can start

00:16:28.749 --> 00:16:28.759
Python apk practic it and you can start
 

00:16:28.759 --> 00:16:31.559
Python apk practic it and you can start
by today and it's backed by academia and

00:16:31.559 --> 00:16:31.569
by today and it's backed by academia and
 

00:16:31.569 --> 00:16:34.749
by today and it's backed by academia and
empirically and also can be used by for

00:16:34.749 --> 00:16:34.759
empirically and also can be used by for
 

00:16:34.759 --> 00:16:36.280
empirically and also can be used by for
other purposes I think this is

00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:36.290
other purposes I think this is
 

00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:37.780
other purposes I think this is
interesting because some people are

00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:37.790
interesting because some people are
 

00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:40.329
interesting because some people are
saying well you're only taking purchases

00:16:40.329 --> 00:16:40.339
saying well you're only taking purchases
 

00:16:40.339 --> 00:16:42.249
saying well you're only taking purchases
but we can think about also some events

00:16:42.249 --> 00:16:42.259
but we can think about also some events
 

00:16:42.259 --> 00:16:44.769
but we can think about also some events
like for example I don't know like level

00:16:44.769 --> 00:16:44.779
like for example I don't know like level
 

00:16:44.779 --> 00:16:47.100
like for example I don't know like level
one you could even consider that and

00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:47.110
one you could even consider that and
 

00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:49.660
one you could even consider that and
estimate the likelihood of playing other

00:16:49.660 --> 00:16:49.670
estimate the likelihood of playing other
 

00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:52.929
estimate the likelihood of playing other
levels on the cons what do we find well

00:16:52.929 --> 00:16:52.939
levels on the cons what do we find well
 

00:16:52.939 --> 00:16:54.850
levels on the cons what do we find well
as I said before it works with in-app

00:16:54.850 --> 00:16:54.860
as I said before it works with in-app
 

00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:56.860
as I said before it works with in-app
purchases us today if we think about

00:16:56.860 --> 00:16:56.870
purchases us today if we think about
 

00:16:56.870 --> 00:16:58.210
purchases us today if we think about
advertising would be a little bit more

00:16:58.210 --> 00:16:58.220
advertising would be a little bit more
 

00:16:58.220 --> 00:16:59.439
advertising would be a little bit more
challenging because of the number of

00:16:59.439 --> 00:16:59.449
challenging because of the number of
 

00:16:59.449 --> 00:17:01.829
challenging because of the number of
events that this is registering and

00:17:01.829 --> 00:17:01.839
events that this is registering and
 

00:17:01.839 --> 00:17:05.500
events that this is registering and
requires significant amount of data okay

00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:05.510
requires significant amount of data okay
 

00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:09.460
requires significant amount of data okay
so this would be the model so which one

00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:09.470
so this would be the model so which one
 

00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:13.240
so this would be the model so which one
is the best so again it's quite hard

00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:13.250
is the best so again it's quite hard
 

00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:15.699
is the best so again it's quite hard
because every model has the AIDS pros

00:17:15.699 --> 00:17:15.709
because every model has the AIDS pros
 

00:17:15.709 --> 00:17:18.460
because every model has the AIDS pros
and cons I would say that personally we

00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:18.470
and cons I would say that personally we
 

00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:20.289
and cons I would say that personally we
will try to look at predictive models

00:17:20.289 --> 00:17:20.299
will try to look at predictive models
 

00:17:20.299 --> 00:17:22.210
will try to look at predictive models
whenever it's possible there's many of

00:17:22.210 --> 00:17:22.220
whenever it's possible there's many of
 

00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:23.980
whenever it's possible there's many of
them this the one that I explained is

00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:23.990
them this the one that I explained is
 

00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:25.899
them this the one that I explained is
just one of them but there's others that

00:17:25.899 --> 00:17:25.909
just one of them but there's others that
 

00:17:25.909 --> 00:17:28.120
just one of them but there's others that
could be useful and I'll try to look at

00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:28.130
could be useful and I'll try to look at
 

00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:30.190
could be useful and I'll try to look at
these whenever we have these are the key

00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:30.200
these whenever we have these are the key
 

00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:32.470
these whenever we have these are the key
points into consideration so what is the

00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:32.480
points into consideration so what is the
 

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:34.029
points into consideration so what is the
current situation of the game have we

00:17:34.029 --> 00:17:34.039
current situation of the game have we
 

00:17:34.039 --> 00:17:35.649
current situation of the game have we
launched it a while ago and we have the

00:17:35.649 --> 00:17:35.659
launched it a while ago and we have the
 

00:17:35.659 --> 00:17:37.720
launched it a while ago and we have the
data what is the primary business model

00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:37.730
data what is the primary business model
 

00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:39.549
data what is the primary business model
that we're looking the type of game and

00:17:39.549 --> 00:17:39.559
that we're looking the type of game and
 

00:17:39.559 --> 00:17:42.100
that we're looking the type of game and
finally do we if we have this

00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:42.110
finally do we if we have this
 

00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:44.200
finally do we if we have this
information about individual item value

00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:44.210
information about individual item value
 

00:17:44.210 --> 00:17:46.240
information about individual item value
can we do actually something with it

00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:46.250
can we do actually something with it
 

00:17:46.250 --> 00:17:47.710
can we do actually something with it
we're just gonna let it

00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:47.720
we're just gonna let it
 

00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:49.330
we're just gonna let it
there and we actually do not have

00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:49.340
there and we actually do not have
 

00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:52.360
there and we actually do not have
resources because we need to do

00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:52.370
resources because we need to do
 

00:17:52.370 --> 00:17:56.680
resources because we need to do
something else right so is that all well

00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:56.690
something else right so is that all well
 

00:17:56.690 --> 00:17:58.360
something else right so is that all well
actually when talking about lifetime

00:17:58.360 --> 00:17:58.370
actually when talking about lifetime
 

00:17:58.370 --> 00:17:59.950
actually when talking about lifetime
value there's other things that people

00:17:59.950 --> 00:17:59.960
value there's other things that people
 

00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:03.370
value there's other things that people
are considering developers so most of it

00:18:03.370 --> 00:18:03.380
are considering developers so most of it
 

00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:05.740
are considering developers so most of it
at first is most of developers they are

00:18:05.740 --> 00:18:05.750
at first is most of developers they are
 

00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:07.810
at first is most of developers they are
looking at net LTV and profitability

00:18:07.810 --> 00:18:07.820
looking at net LTV and profitability
 

00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:09.640
looking at net LTV and profitability
rather than gross LTV so they are

00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:09.650
rather than gross LTV so they are
 

00:18:09.650 --> 00:18:11.830
rather than gross LTV so they are
already subtracting in some of the costs

00:18:11.830 --> 00:18:11.840
already subtracting in some of the costs
 

00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:13.930
already subtracting in some of the costs
then the second one is we are looking at

00:18:13.930 --> 00:18:13.940
then the second one is we are looking at
 

00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:16.990
then the second one is we are looking at
very long term lifetime values like 180

00:18:16.990 --> 00:18:17.000
very long term lifetime values like 180
 

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:17.500
very long term lifetime values like 180
days

00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:17.510
days
 

00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:19.870
days
farther on beyond you might think about

00:18:19.870 --> 00:18:19.880
farther on beyond you might think about
 

00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:21.970
farther on beyond you might think about
like maybe looking at discounting it

00:18:21.970 --> 00:18:21.980
like maybe looking at discounting it
 

00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:25.060
like maybe looking at discounting it
then business models many of you are

00:18:25.060 --> 00:18:25.070
then business models many of you are
 

00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:26.950
then business models many of you are
using to business models at the same

00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:26.960
using to business models at the same
 

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:29.289
using to business models at the same
time in-app purchases and advertising so

00:18:29.289 --> 00:18:29.299
time in-app purchases and advertising so
 

00:18:29.299 --> 00:18:32.380
time in-app purchases and advertising so
one good way to think about like how

00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:32.390
one good way to think about like how
 

00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:34.060
one good way to think about like how
would you integrate both of them and you

00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:34.070
would you integrate both of them and you
 

00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:35.620
would you integrate both of them and you
would look at all your users from both

00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:35.630
would look at all your users from both
 

00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:37.659
would look at all your users from both
business models at the same time and

00:18:37.659 --> 00:18:37.669
business models at the same time and
 

00:18:37.669 --> 00:18:40.240
business models at the same time and
then lastly we see a general trend in

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:40.250
then lastly we see a general trend in
 

00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:42.039
then lastly we see a general trend in
the business is in the mobile gaming

00:18:42.039 --> 00:18:42.049
the business is in the mobile gaming
 

00:18:42.049 --> 00:18:44.289
the business is in the mobile gaming
industry a lot of multiplayer online

00:18:44.289 --> 00:18:44.299
industry a lot of multiplayer online
 

00:18:44.299 --> 00:18:47.620
industry a lot of multiplayer online
games that might need indeed to assign

00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:47.630
games that might need indeed to assign
 

00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:49.690
games that might need indeed to assign
some monetary value to those users that

00:18:49.690 --> 00:18:49.700
some monetary value to those users that
 

00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:52.360
some monetary value to those users that
they generate some liquidity you don't

00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:52.370
they generate some liquidity you don't
 

00:18:52.370 --> 00:18:54.520
they generate some liquidity you don't
want to find yourself playing against a

00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:54.530
want to find yourself playing against a
 

00:18:54.530 --> 00:18:57.779
want to find yourself playing against a
board again and again and again over and

00:18:57.779 --> 00:18:57.789
board again and again and again over and
 

00:18:57.789 --> 00:19:00.039
board again and again and again over and
if you think about other things so

00:19:00.039 --> 00:19:00.049
if you think about other things so
 

00:19:00.049 --> 00:19:02.700
if you think about other things so
virality has a very very important

00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:02.710
virality has a very very important
 

00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:06.070
virality has a very very important
function in UA but it a priori it

00:19:06.070 --> 00:19:06.080
function in UA but it a priori it
 

00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:07.180
function in UA but it a priori it
doesn't affect the lifetime value

00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:07.190
doesn't affect the lifetime value
 

00:19:07.190 --> 00:19:09.549
doesn't affect the lifetime value
because you're augmenting the equity of

00:19:09.549 --> 00:19:09.559
because you're augmenting the equity of
 

00:19:09.559 --> 00:19:11.590
because you're augmenting the equity of
players and I'm putting that example

00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:11.600
players and I'm putting that example
 

00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:13.899
players and I'm putting that example
over there but it shouldn't affect the

00:19:13.899 --> 00:19:13.909
over there but it shouldn't affect the
 

00:19:13.909 --> 00:19:15.460
over there but it shouldn't affect the
overall lifetime value because you're

00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:15.470
overall lifetime value because you're
 

00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:18.340
overall lifetime value because you're
just adding new new users the equity of

00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:18.350
just adding new new users the equity of
 

00:19:18.350 --> 00:19:21.070
just adding new new users the equity of
those paying users still is very

00:19:21.070 --> 00:19:21.080
those paying users still is very
 

00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:22.840
those paying users still is very
important from a UI perspective because

00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:22.850
important from a UI perspective because
 

00:19:22.850 --> 00:19:25.090
important from a UI perspective because
you're bringing another user with with

00:19:25.090 --> 00:19:25.100
you're bringing another user with with
 

00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:27.039
you're bringing another user with with
that user that your acquire and then

00:19:27.039 --> 00:19:27.049
that user that your acquire and then
 

00:19:27.049 --> 00:19:28.960
that user that your acquire and then
last two things would be frequency of

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:28.970
last two things would be frequency of
 

00:19:28.970 --> 00:19:30.970
last two things would be frequency of
calculation so how freaking are you

00:19:30.970 --> 00:19:30.980
calculation so how freaking are you
 

00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:33.430
calculation so how freaking are you
calculating I wouldn't recommend daily

00:19:33.430 --> 00:19:33.440
calculating I wouldn't recommend daily
 

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:35.350
calculating I wouldn't recommend daily
but I would say like depending on the

00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:35.360
but I would say like depending on the
 

00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:37.240
but I would say like depending on the
game if you're constantly updating so

00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:37.250
game if you're constantly updating so
 

00:19:37.250 --> 00:19:40.270
game if you're constantly updating so
think about this and then lastly the

00:19:40.270 --> 00:19:40.280
think about this and then lastly the
 

00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:41.980
think about this and then lastly the
segment and the cohort analysis the

00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:41.990
segment and the cohort analysis the
 

00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:43.810
segment and the cohort analysis the
first one would be top versus lowest

00:19:43.810 --> 00:19:43.820
first one would be top versus lowest
 

00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:46.090
first one would be top versus lowest
spenders this is a typical one some

00:19:46.090 --> 00:19:46.100
spenders this is a typical one some
 

00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:47.560
spenders this is a typical one some
developers are looking at geographies

00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:47.570
developers are looking at geographies
 

00:19:47.570 --> 00:19:49.930
developers are looking at geographies
obviously and then time a traffic

00:19:49.930 --> 00:19:49.940
obviously and then time a traffic
 

00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:51.640
obviously and then time a traffic
sources those would be the most typical

00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:51.650
sources those would be the most typical
 

00:19:51.650 --> 00:19:53.710
sources those would be the most typical
ones but there might be others that

00:19:53.710 --> 00:19:53.720
ones but there might be others that
 

00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:57.700
ones but there might be others that
you're currently overlooking so with

00:19:57.700 --> 00:19:57.710
you're currently overlooking so with
 

00:19:57.710 --> 00:19:59.260
you're currently overlooking so with
these

00:19:59.260 --> 00:19:59.270
these
 

00:19:59.270 --> 00:20:01.909
these
so what are the tips and best practices

00:20:01.909 --> 00:20:01.919
so what are the tips and best practices
 

00:20:01.919 --> 00:20:04.250
so what are the tips and best practices
so there's some tips to improve I asked

00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:04.260
so there's some tips to improve I asked
 

00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:06.380
so there's some tips to improve I asked
many of the developers what would you do

00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:06.390
many of the developers what would you do
 

00:20:06.390 --> 00:20:08.060
many of the developers what would you do
like to improve the LTV calculation

00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:08.070
like to improve the LTV calculation
 

00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:11.060
like to improve the LTV calculation
right so the first one is forget about

00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:11.070
right so the first one is forget about
 

00:20:11.070 --> 00:20:12.680
right so the first one is forget about
like vanity metrics that they are not

like vanity metrics that they are not
 

00:20:12.690 --> 00:20:15.830
like vanity metrics that they are not
used that you not used in the end I put

00:20:15.830 --> 00:20:15.840
used that you not used in the end I put

registered users we might argue these

00:20:20.210 --> 00:20:20.220
registered users we might argue these
 

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:22.399
registered users we might argue these
but in the end like you won't occur only

00:20:22.399 --> 00:20:22.409
but in the end like you won't occur only
 

00:20:22.409 --> 00:20:24.200
but in the end like you won't occur only
about like those metrics that are

00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:24.210
about like those metrics that are
 

00:20:24.210 --> 00:20:26.180
about like those metrics that are
relevant for an LTV calculation in this

00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:26.190
relevant for an LTV calculation in this
 

00:20:26.190 --> 00:20:28.760
relevant for an LTV calculation in this
case for example active users cost of

plan thoroughly it's super important to

00:20:34.039 --> 00:20:34.049
plan thoroughly it's super important to
 

00:20:34.049 --> 00:20:36.500
plan thoroughly it's super important to
like try to plan in advance rather than

your daily decisions integrity of data

00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:45.090
your daily decisions integrity of data
 

00:20:45.090 --> 00:20:47.570
your daily decisions integrity of data
super important we need to think about

00:20:47.570 --> 00:20:47.580
super important we need to think about
 

00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:50.389
super important we need to think about
how we have integrity like data that is

00:20:50.389 --> 00:20:50.399
how we have integrity like data that is
 

00:20:50.399 --> 00:20:53.240
how we have integrity like data that is
real from the very first day and then

00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:53.250
real from the very first day and then
 

00:20:53.250 --> 00:20:55.430
real from the very first day and then
lastly is making trade-offs so if we

00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:55.440
lastly is making trade-offs so if we
 

00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:58.580
lastly is making trade-offs so if we
don't have enough data to actually take

00:20:58.580 --> 00:20:58.590
don't have enough data to actually take
 

00:20:58.590 --> 00:21:00.649
don't have enough data to actually take
a decision we might have to think about

00:21:00.649 --> 00:21:00.659
a decision we might have to think about
 

00:21:00.659 --> 00:21:03.760
a decision we might have to think about
how we extract those whales or those

00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:03.770
how we extract those whales or those

00:21:17.330 --> 00:21:17.340
remember like 5/5 is a lot buddy
 

00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:19.580
remember like 5/5 is a lot buddy
so the first one is like LTV has many

00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:19.590
so the first one is like LTV has many
 

00:21:19.590 --> 00:21:22.190
so the first one is like LTV has many
usages as of today is very much used for

00:21:22.190 --> 00:21:22.200
usages as of today is very much used for
 

00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:24.019
usages as of today is very much used for
you a but you you can think about also

00:21:24.019 --> 00:21:24.029
you a but you you can think about also
 

00:21:24.029 --> 00:21:26.120
you a but you you can think about also
from a life of perspective to decide

00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:26.130
from a life of perspective to decide
 

00:21:26.130 --> 00:21:28.100
from a life of perspective to decide
whether a new functionality or feature

00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:28.110
whether a new functionality or feature
 

00:21:28.110 --> 00:21:30.200
whether a new functionality or feature
is going to be useful then we can think

00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:30.210
is going to be useful then we can think
 

00:21:30.210 --> 00:21:31.789
is going to be useful then we can think
about also that it's not an accurate

00:21:31.789 --> 00:21:31.799
about also that it's not an accurate
 

00:21:31.799 --> 00:21:34.220
about also that it's not an accurate
science so think about when you when

00:21:34.220 --> 00:21:34.230
science so think about when you when
 

00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:35.269
science so think about when you when
you're talking about lifetime value

00:21:35.269 --> 00:21:35.279
you're talking about lifetime value
 

00:21:35.279 --> 00:21:37.580
you're talking about lifetime value
think about like a range or like an

00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:37.590
think about like a range or like an
 

00:21:37.590 --> 00:21:40.610
think about like a range or like an
interval of confidence lastly if you can

00:21:40.610 --> 00:21:40.620
interval of confidence lastly if you can
 

00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:42.860
interval of confidence lastly if you can
the predictive models might be useful if

00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:42.870
the predictive models might be useful if
 

00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:44.480
the predictive models might be useful if
you have the data and you have the

00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:44.490
you have the data and you have the
 

00:21:44.490 --> 00:21:46.340
you have the data and you have the
capabilities again I'm not saying that

00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:46.350
capabilities again I'm not saying that
 

00:21:46.350 --> 00:21:48.799
capabilities again I'm not saying that
don't use the other ones but just think

00:21:48.799 --> 00:21:48.809
don't use the other ones but just think
 

00:21:48.809 --> 00:21:51.409
don't use the other ones but just think
about this in case you can actually run

00:21:51.409 --> 00:21:51.419
about this in case you can actually run
 

00:21:51.419 --> 00:21:55.039
about this in case you can actually run
them and then first like four and fifth

00:21:55.039 --> 00:21:55.049
them and then first like four and fifth
 

00:21:55.049 --> 00:21:57.200
them and then first like four and fifth
point would be decide in advance what

00:21:57.200 --> 00:21:57.210
point would be decide in advance what
 

00:21:57.210 --> 00:21:58.789
point would be decide in advance what
are the things that they've the course

00:21:58.789 --> 00:21:58.799
are the things that they've the course
 

00:21:58.799 --> 00:22:00.620
are the things that they've the course
the frequency how frequently you're

00:22:00.620 --> 00:22:00.630
the frequency how frequently you're
 

00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:03.919
the frequency how frequently you're
going to calculate LTV and finally make

00:22:03.919 --> 00:22:03.929
going to calculate LTV and finally make
 

00:22:03.929 --> 00:22:05.539
going to calculate LTV and finally make
sure that you track the relevant metrics

00:22:05.539 --> 00:22:05.549
sure that you track the relevant metrics
 

00:22:05.549 --> 00:22:08.630
sure that you track the relevant metrics
and then you basically have things like

00:22:08.630 --> 00:22:08.640
and then you basically have things like
 

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:10.310
and then you basically have things like
integrity of data and take the decision

00:22:10.310 --> 00:22:10.320
integrity of data and take the decision
 

00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:11.590
integrity of data and take the decision
based on on

00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:11.600
based on on
 

00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:20.280
based on on
eleven samples

00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:20.290
 

00:22:20.290 --> 00:22:22.350
