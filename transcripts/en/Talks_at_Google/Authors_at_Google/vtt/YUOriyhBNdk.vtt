JUSTIN KOSSLYN: Thank
you Andrei and Irina

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:09.110
for joining us here today.

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:11.870
At Google, we talk a
lot about the user.

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:14.240
I spent two and a half years
in Mountain View as a PM

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:15.330
on couple of different products.

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:16.871
And whenever I talked
about the user,

00:00:16.871 --> 00:00:18.360
I would look at a dashboard.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.900
And that dashboard would have
various numbers and graphs

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.512
of the number of users in
different countries, the level

00:00:23.512 --> 00:00:25.970
of engagement that they had on
a day to day or week to week

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:26.880
basis.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.319
And that was my touch point.

00:00:28.319 --> 00:00:30.110
But I think why I'm so
grateful that you're

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:32.840
joining us here today is that
you represent the user in it's

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.760
so much more tangible sense.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.950
You are journalists
on the front lines

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:39.430
of a super important
issue for Google.

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.780
Our mission is to organize
the world's information,

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.404
make it accessible and useful.

00:00:43.404 --> 00:00:44.820
And that is what
you do every day.

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.750
You organize information on
very sensitive, very challenging

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:49.820
topics, and you make it
accessible and useful

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:51.110
to the world.

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:52.700
And so my hope
today is that we can

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.360
get into what that process looks
like, how technology has helped

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.670
and hindered, and what
the folks in this room who

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.929
care about these issues can do
to contribute going forward.

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:04.220
To begin with, maybe if you're
comfortable just sharing

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.500
a little bit about your
backgrounds, the work

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.152
you do, and the places
that you do it in.

00:01:09.152 --> 00:01:10.610
ANDREI SOLDATOV:
Thank you, Justin.

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.590
Thank you, everybody
for having us.

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.290
As [INAUDIBLE] said
and Justin said,

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.900
we are the Russian
investigative journalists.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.720
And we have been doing
this for almost 17 years.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.330
We've focused on the
Russian Secret Services.

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.420
In the late 2000s,
we started off

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.600
investigating the change
in digital landscape

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:33.530
in the country.

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.580
And in 2012, it
became quite apparent

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:44.960
that the Kremlin got scared
of the internet, and mostly

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.890
because of the Arab Spring and
the Moscow protests on 2011,

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.240
2012.

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.100
So the Kremlin started a massive
offensive on internet freedoms

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.974
in our country.

00:01:57.974 --> 00:02:00.470
IRINA BOROGRAN: Firstly, thank
you for inviting me here.

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.340
And as Andrei mentioned,
it was this time

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:09.580
when internet censorship was
introduced in Russia, became

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.460
a start for writing
our new book,

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:17.110
"The Red Web, The Kremlin's
War on the Internet,"

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.010
which was published in 2015
here in the United States.

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:28.010
But since 2015, there have
been many developments

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:33.120
in Russia and US
relationship, and notably

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.898
during the US election.

00:02:34.898 --> 00:02:41.630
And we felt that it was very
important to write about this,

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:46.500
and to share what
we found by adding

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.510
a new chapter to the book.

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.500
And we called it, "The Red Web
Comes to the United States."

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.095
And it was published
this August.

00:02:58.095 --> 00:02:59.720
JUSTIN KOSSLYN: So
let's talk about how

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.830
censorship works in Russia.

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.130
Can you give me a little
bit of a sense of,

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:07.700
on a day to day basis, what the
experience of someone in Russia

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.817
is like as relates
to censorship?

00:03:09.817 --> 00:03:11.400
ANDREI SOLDATOV:
Well, on the surface,

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.640
it looks like we
have all elements,

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.940
technological elements
of censorship.

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.740
We have an internet
filtering system.

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:23.770
We have lots of blacklists,
not one, of banned websites.

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:28.730
We have an extensive system
of online surveillance.

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:31.780
And it's extremely intrusive.

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.920
Actually, it's a
system of back doors

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.030
to all services in
our country provided

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.190
for the Russian Secret Services.

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.680
And we also have,
unfortunately, we

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.650
have people sent
to jail for posting

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.340
something sensitive or
critical of the Kremlin.

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.710
But at the same time,
it's quite clear

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:55.520
that this system technologically
is not very, I would say,

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:56.930
effective.

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:59.330
Internet filtering is porous.

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:01.120
For example, if you want to--

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.910
actually, believe that you need
to access a blocked website,

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:07.880
you can to use very simple
methods, simple tools.

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:09.550
You don't need even to use WIPI.

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:11.300
You can use Google Translate.

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:12.230
It also helps.

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.650
JUSTIN KOSSLYN: Anyone from
Google Translate here today?

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:18.260
ANDREI SOLDATOV: I'll say hello.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.240
And if you want to
communicate securely,

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:23.510
you still have this option.

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:24.810
You can use messengers.

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.430
So lots of them are
extremely popular in Russia.

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:32.390
And they turned to
a sort of new media.

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:39.770
But still, the system is
quite effective in silencing

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:44.270
people who want to talk
about things online openly.

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:48.230
And I think the idea
of the Kremlin approach

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:52.850
is to be based more on
intimidation than technology.

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:54.860
And actually, it's a
very Soviet approach.

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:56.330
When we researched
it for our book,

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.130
we checked how things
were organized back

00:04:58.130 --> 00:04:59.450
in the Soviet times.

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:02.210
And one of the most
astonishing things we found out

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:06.960
is that the KGB as a
powerful security service

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.190
was technically
not very advanced.

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:12.750
And the head of
powers of the KGB,

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:17.680
it was capable of
eavesdropping on 300 phone

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:18.682
calls simultaneously.

00:05:18.682 --> 00:05:20.140
JUSTIN KOSSLYN:
And 300 phone calls

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:21.270
at the same time, that was it.

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:22.060
That was the cap.

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:22.480
ANDREI SOLDATOV: Yeah.

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:22.980
That was 1991.

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:25.271
IRINA BOROGRAN: And everybody
was frightened by the KGB

00:05:25.271 --> 00:05:26.105
in the Soviet times.

00:05:26.105 --> 00:05:27.646
ANDREI SOLDATOV: So
actually, we know

00:05:27.646 --> 00:05:29.500
how-- they knew how
to send a message,

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:31.870
but everybody should
be very, very cautious.

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:34.720
And it looks like they use
the same approach today.

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:35.470
We send a message.

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:37.870
We can pick up some
people, send them to jail.

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:39.442
And that would make [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:39.442 --> 00:05:40.900
JUSTIN KOSSLYN:
And does that work?

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:42.790
When they send folks
to jail, whether it's

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:47.590
an activist, a journalist,
someone else, what happens?

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:49.480
IRINA BOROGRAN: It happens--

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:50.482
bloggers and users.

00:05:50.482 --> 00:05:51.940
Because it's not
about journalists.

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:55.670
Journalists have not been
sent in jail in Russia.

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:59.100
But people found out
that they're in jail,

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:03.040
there are some kind of
protest in the cities

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:04.690
or mostly in Moscow.

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:05.455
And that's all.

00:06:05.455 --> 00:06:07.330
JUSTIN KOSSLYN: Are
those protests effective?

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:08.170
ANDREI SOLDATOV: No.

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:12.090
IRINA BOROGRAN: One times, it
was effective when a blogger--

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:14.770
one blogger who
went to the church

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:17.820
and played and
played Pokemon Go,

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:19.930
and then posted a
video on YouTube,

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:22.780
was sent to jail for this,
for posting this video,

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:25.750
because it is very, very
offensive for the Orthodox

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:27.250
Church in Russia.

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:32.500
And there is a special
article at the criminal court.

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:34.250
He was sent to jail.

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:37.900
It incited a lot of
protest on the internet,

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:40.720
on YouTube, everywhere,
and even on the street.

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:43.600
And after this protest, he was--

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:45.100
ANDREI SOLDATOV:
Released, actually.

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:46.350
IRINA BOROGRAN: He was bailed.

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:50.290
And he wasn't released, but
he's under house arrest now.

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:51.940
That's OK for him.

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:54.470
JUSTIN KOSSLYN: So what are
people's views on censorship

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:54.970
in Russia?

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:57.357
Do people generally think
that this is a good system,

00:06:57.357 --> 00:06:59.190
or they think it's a
bad system, or are they

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:01.550
just indifferent, they
accept it as a way of life?

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:03.550
IRINA BOROGRAN:
Beginning in 2012,

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:06.580
when the authorities introduced
this internet filtering

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:10.010
system in the country,
general public was not

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:11.530
very interested in this.

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:15.750
And we didn't notice any
attention to this issue.

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:19.300
We tried to attract a lot
of attention, but we failed.

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:23.000
But after then, few
years ago, the Kremlin

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.210
made two big mistakes.

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:31.570
The Kremlin blocked the
most popular torrent website

00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:32.680
in the country.

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:35.750
And then they tried
to block PornHub.

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:42.250
After that even people who
have never been interested

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:45.580
in Russian politics,
or in politics at all,

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:49.199
started learning how to
use circumvention tools.

00:07:49.199 --> 00:07:50.740
ANDREI SOLDATOV:
And actually Russia,

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:54.370
in a week after this biggest
Russian torrents website

00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:55.420
was blocked--

00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:56.920
JUSTIN KOSSLYN: You
mean BitTorrent,

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:58.300
the legal file-sharing service?

00:07:58.300 --> 00:07:59.350
ANDREI SOLDATOV: Yeah.

00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:01.320
So almost immediately,
in a week,

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:03.530
Russia skyrocketed to
the second position

00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:05.410
in the number of Tor users.

00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:07.470
Now, we are second only
to the United States.

00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:09.790
JUSTIN KOSSLYN: Tor, the
anonymous routing browser?

00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:11.860
ANDREI SOLDATOV:
Yes, this famous VPN

00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:14.182
which is provided for free.

00:08:14.182 --> 00:08:15.140
JUSTIN KOSSLYN: Got it.

00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:17.890
So as long as they don't
go after your illegal file

00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:19.720
sharing or your
pornography, it's all good.

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:22.330
But once they cross those
lines, people got agitated.

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:25.042
ANDREI SOLDATOV: Absolutely.

00:08:25.042 --> 00:08:26.500
JUSTIN KOSSLYN:
Has there been any,

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:29.350
on the political side, any
mobilization or any cases

00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:31.084
where anyone has
engaged in the same way?

00:08:31.084 --> 00:08:32.500
ANDREI SOLDATOV:
Yeah, I think so.

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:35.830
Because initially, the
idea of internet filtering

00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:40.059
was sold to the public on the
pretext of protecting children

00:08:40.059 --> 00:08:41.950
against pedophiles,
and against people

00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:45.760
who spread suicidal notes,
something really strange.

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:49.480
But people accepted this
because it's all about children.

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:50.710
But five years passed.

00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:54.500
And now everybody understood
it's not about children.

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:55.690
It's about politics.

00:08:55.690 --> 00:08:58.990
And this year, we got three
protests, actually, in Moscow.

00:08:58.990 --> 00:08:59.780
We got marches.

00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:01.660
We got big events.

00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:05.080
And the Russian Pirate Party
organized some of these events.

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:07.152
And we got thousands
of people protesting.

00:09:07.152 --> 00:09:08.860
JUSTIN KOSSLYN: The
Russian Pirate Party?

00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:09.734
ANDREI SOLDATOV: Yes.

00:09:09.734 --> 00:09:12.010
It's a very popular
thing in terms

00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:14.140
of they actually
monitor a lot of things

00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:16.060
about internet censorship.

00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:18.710
And also, they're trying to
organize some things offline.

00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:21.770
And the latest protest
was really huge.

00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:23.800
It was about
thousands of people.

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:25.630
JUSTIN KOSSLYN:
That's very cool.

00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:27.940
Isn't the Pirate Party
running Iceland, incidentally?

00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:29.320
ANDREI SOLDATOV: Exactly.

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:31.900
It's a big aspiration for all
branches of the Pirate Party

00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:32.917
everywhere.

00:09:32.917 --> 00:09:34.000
JUSTIN KOSSLYN: Very cool.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.817
So turning to
technology a little bit,

00:09:36.817 --> 00:09:38.150
is there anything you can share?

00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:39.608
You mentioned
earlier that there is

00:09:39.608 --> 00:09:42.310
this technological
censorship regime in Russia.

00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:44.710
But it sounds like it's
only effective to a point.

00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:45.600
Why is that?

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:48.100
ANDREI SOLDATOV: Well, I think
that the problem is that when

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:53.590
you have the internet in a
country built almost 20 years

00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:57.770
without any kind of intrusion
from the government--

00:09:57.770 --> 00:10:02.310
and that was the case for Russia
for almost 20 years from 1991

00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:05.040
to 2011--

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:06.900
it's extremely difficult
technologically

00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:10.110
to add this element of
censorship and filtering.

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:15.720
You need to redesign or redefine
the entire infrastructure

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:16.660
of the internet.

00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:20.670
It's extremely difficult, as the
Russian authorities found out.

00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:23.190
Last year, they even tried
to enlist some support

00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:24.820
from the Chinese.

00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:27.980
And the Chinese went to Moscow,
said, we're happy to help.

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:30.480
But you need to get rid
of all American equipment.

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:34.110
The problem is that it's really
difficult. You cannot replace,

00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:37.950
say, in one day, all Cisco
in such a big country with

00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:40.565
something produced in China.

00:10:40.565 --> 00:10:41.940
So that's why now,
they're trying

00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:46.320
to find a way how to remodel
the critical infrastructure

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:47.830
of the internet in Russia.

00:10:47.830 --> 00:10:50.580
But it's very tricky.

00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:53.220
And I don't see any
successes so far.

00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:58.140
IRINA BOROGRAN: In fact,
the Russian authorities

00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:02.240
were frightened to replace
the American equipment

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:04.680
by the Chinese equipment.

00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:10.430
Chinese offered to put into
the system Huawei equipment.

00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:13.200
And that was frightening for
the Russian security services,

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:15.599
because they are
suspicious to Chinese.

00:11:15.599 --> 00:11:16.890
ANDREI SOLDATOV: Chinese, yeah.

00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:19.632
IRINA BOROGRAN: So it's
also an advantage for us.

00:11:19.632 --> 00:11:21.090
JUSTIN KOSSLYN:
Well, I don't think

00:11:21.090 --> 00:11:22.714
you need to convince
a room of Googlers

00:11:22.714 --> 00:11:24.990
that doing a whole-scale
infrastructure swap out

00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:28.310
is going to be
technologically hard.

00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:30.600
How about on the sort
of consumer side?

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:33.300
You guys are individual actors.

00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:35.850
You don't have the
resources of a large player.

00:11:35.850 --> 00:11:37.892
How do you use
technology in your work?

00:11:37.892 --> 00:11:38.850
Is it a force for good?

00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:40.339
Is it a hindrance?

00:11:40.339 --> 00:11:41.630
What are your thoughts on that?

00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:44.160
IRINA BOROGRAN: Without
technology, we just

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:45.330
wouldn't be who we are.

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:51.580
Because we set up our website
agentura.ru back in 2000.

00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:53.260
And we were young journalists.

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:59.220
We didn't have any money to pay
for printing house, for paper.

00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:05.820
But we spent a little money
for maintaining our websites.

00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:09.010
And it still cost us very cheap.

00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:11.370
So we can do--

00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:13.442
we can continue doing our work.

00:12:13.442 --> 00:12:15.150
ANDREI SOLDATOV: And
also, actually, it's

00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:18.340
extremely important for us
because, for many reasons,

00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:23.970
it's now become really difficult
to find a place for publishing

00:12:23.970 --> 00:12:25.890
your stories in the country.

00:12:25.890 --> 00:12:29.640
It's not a coincidence that
we have both of our books,

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:31.240
and the first was
published in 2010,

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:33.520
it was all about the
Russian Secret Services,

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:35.000
and the second one, "Red Web."

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.790
And both of them, we published
it first in the United States.

00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:41.070
But to communicate
with our publisher,

00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:43.290
of course you need technology.

00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:49.770
And thanks to Skype and Google
Hangout, while you can--

00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:53.210
you might be in Moscow,
still communicating

00:12:53.210 --> 00:12:55.470
with your editors
and publishers, which

00:12:55.470 --> 00:12:56.520
is a great thing.

00:12:56.520 --> 00:13:00.690
And also, of course, it helps
us to gather information

00:13:00.690 --> 00:13:04.410
and intelligence,
in a way, because we

00:13:04.410 --> 00:13:07.140
can use all kinds of
things like data mining.

00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:09.690
And now it's extremely
important in Russia.

00:13:09.690 --> 00:13:11.970
You can use all these databases.

00:13:11.970 --> 00:13:16.710
And you can find some
really exposing stuff.

00:13:16.710 --> 00:13:18.990
Like some years ago,
thanks to one database,

00:13:18.990 --> 00:13:23.130
we found out that now we
have in Russia not one system

00:13:23.130 --> 00:13:26.700
of online surveillance mentioned
by one security service,

00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:28.120
but eight of them.

00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:31.050
JUSTIN KOSSLYN: Eight different
systems of online surveillance?

00:13:31.050 --> 00:13:33.460
ANDREI SOLDATOV: Yes,
built simultaneously

00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:35.820
by eight agencies.

00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:38.940
And we just found it out
thanks to data mining.

00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:42.840
Because officially, you cannot
get any comments from these

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:45.960
agencies, because it's
considered to be state secret.

00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:47.690
And sometimes,
technologies which

00:13:47.690 --> 00:13:53.370
were not meant to be
used by journalists

00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:57.180
prove to be extremely
helpful, for example, drones.

00:13:57.180 --> 00:14:00.070
And some years ago, I think
it was seven years ago,

00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:02.320
Irina had a very
big investigation

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:04.830
about the luxury
villas which were

00:14:04.830 --> 00:14:08.280
given for free to the FSB
Russian Security Services

00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:09.620
generals.

00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:11.340
And I think at that
time, you never

00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:12.810
thought that you can
actually approach this.

00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:14.768
IRINA BOROGRAN: It wasn't
possible to approach.

00:14:14.768 --> 00:14:15.600
I got information.

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:17.100
I checked all documents.

00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:20.430
It was clear that these
generals just grabbed

00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:23.130
state real estate for free.

00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:28.160
And I had now a chance to
approach to this real estate

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:29.820
and take a picture.

00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:33.260
Because it was very well guarded
by the security services.

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:37.740
And it was hidden under a
huge fence-- no chances.

00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:43.000
But now, I can do this
easily to launch a drone.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.920
ANDREI SOLDATOV: Actually, we
got some interesting things

00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:49.170
available on YouTube.

00:14:49.170 --> 00:14:52.440
It's mostly done by
a Russian opposition

00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:53.880
leader, Navalny's team.

00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:57.120
And they got this team
of-- and they can actually

00:14:57.120 --> 00:14:59.040
launch drones all the time.

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:01.410
In the most recent
example, they just--

00:15:01.410 --> 00:15:04.250
I think it was three weeks
ago-- they exposed and used

00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:07.450
secret luxury villa
renovated specifically

00:15:07.450 --> 00:15:11.130
for Putin's personal use.

00:15:11.130 --> 00:15:13.450
And it's crazy footage.

00:15:13.450 --> 00:15:15.410
You can see everything.

00:15:15.410 --> 00:15:17.035
And it's amazing.

00:15:17.035 --> 00:15:18.910
JUSTIN KOSSLYN: And it's
on YouTube, you say.

00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:19.450
ANDREI SOLDATOV: Exactly.

00:15:19.450 --> 00:15:20.784
IRINA BOROGRAN: It's on YouTube.

00:15:20.784 --> 00:15:22.574
JUSTIN KOSSLYN: So you
mentioned that there

00:15:22.574 --> 00:15:23.890
are eight different agencies.

00:15:23.890 --> 00:15:26.590
Can you give a little bit more
color on the kind of things

00:15:26.590 --> 00:15:27.910
that they're looking at?

00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:30.544
You said earlier that they're
filtering internet stuff.

00:15:30.544 --> 00:15:31.960
But with eight
different agencies,

00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:34.120
is that all they're doing, or
are there other activities?

00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:34.840
ANDREI SOLDATOV:
No, of course, they

00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:36.190
have other activities to do.

00:15:36.190 --> 00:15:37.810
But they have the
right to conduct

00:15:37.810 --> 00:15:39.100
these kinds of operations.

00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:42.360
So because now, we had
this climate in Russia

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:44.560
where actually, if
you ask for some funds

00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:46.810
for the secret
services, all is fine.

00:15:46.810 --> 00:15:49.120
Vladimir Putin is very happy
to provide these funds.

00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:51.970
So these agencies just
use it as an opportunity

00:15:51.970 --> 00:15:55.090
to build their own systems
of online surveillance.

00:15:55.090 --> 00:15:58.750
The tricky thing about this
surveillance, which is it's

00:15:58.750 --> 00:16:03.280
not like mass surveillance,
because there still

00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:06.400
some technical problems for
the Russian secret services.

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:08.350
Especially, for
example, they do not

00:16:08.350 --> 00:16:10.390
know how to build
huge databases.

00:16:10.390 --> 00:16:13.450
They still rely on American
technologists like Oracle.

00:16:13.450 --> 00:16:17.490
To be honest, even the
internal database of the FSB

00:16:17.490 --> 00:16:19.360
is built on Oracle.

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:22.280
So they do not know
how to do those things.

00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:23.890
So instead of mass
surveillance, they

00:16:23.890 --> 00:16:26.860
do targeted surveillance, which
means that they need first

00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:28.720
to know who should be spied on.

00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:30.700
And then they start the thing.

00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:36.040
But in a way, it's extremely
effective in making the IT

00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:38.710
industry in Russia complicit
in these activities.

00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:40.325
Because what
actually it means, it

00:16:40.325 --> 00:16:44.050
means that if you are small
or big internet service

00:16:44.050 --> 00:16:46.810
provider, in Moscow
or in any town,

00:16:46.810 --> 00:16:48.060
you need to get a license.

00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:50.020
And one of the things
in this license

00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:53.690
is you are required to
install a special equipment,

00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:56.890
so-called black box, which
is actually a backdoor.

00:16:56.890 --> 00:17:01.750
For that, you need to get
a plan of implementation

00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:03.850
from the local
branch of the FSB.

00:17:03.850 --> 00:17:05.349
And actually, it
means that you need

00:17:05.349 --> 00:17:07.150
to get along with these guys.

00:17:07.150 --> 00:17:09.640
And you are provided
a contact number.

00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:13.780
So a guy from the local
branch could always call you

00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:15.160
and ask for some favors.

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:17.560
And also, you have
physically a cable

00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:22.630
which connects your service with
the local branch of the FSB.

00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:24.400
And you know nothing
about what actually

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:27.520
is intercepted on your services,
because it's all state secret.

00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:29.320
And you have no
security clearance.

00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:32.050
As ISP, you have no
access, sometimes, even

00:17:32.050 --> 00:17:34.540
to the room where you
have his black box.

00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:37.880
So it's actually a back door,
but also it's a phone number.

00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:41.400
So you might be, one day asked
to shut down some website

00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:45.820
or maybe to look into
someone's email accounts,

00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:48.700
and to provide it to
the FSB as a favor.

00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:52.460
JUSTIN KOSSLYN: How do
they decide who to target?

00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:54.920
IRINA BOROGRAN:
That's complicated.

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:59.170
In fact, they have
to combat crimes.

00:17:59.170 --> 00:18:05.880
But aside crimes, now
they monitor environment

00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:08.770
in a particular region
or in Moscow, say,

00:18:08.770 --> 00:18:15.190
and just to choose the victim.

00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:17.140
Usually, mostly,
this is a person

00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:21.500
who was known for his or
her political activity

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:24.850
or some opposition activity, or
publishing something critical

00:18:24.850 --> 00:18:26.140
of the Kremlin.

00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:30.190
And when they are
designated as a target,

00:18:30.190 --> 00:18:33.380
they started to monitor all
his activity on the internet.

00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:37.180
And this is enough for--

00:18:37.180 --> 00:18:40.960
sometimes it's enough for
sentence him or her to prison.

00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:42.730
Let me give one example.

00:18:42.730 --> 00:18:46.210
One guy was sent to
prison for two years

00:18:46.210 --> 00:18:51.460
only for posting on his page
on social network of VKontakte,

00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:55.490
which is modeled after Facebook,
the most popular in Russia,

00:18:55.490 --> 00:19:01.120
pictures of toothpaste,
of a tube of toothpaste.

00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:04.690
And sentence was like this--

00:19:04.690 --> 00:19:07.720
"squeeze Russia
out of yourself."

00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:08.965
He got two years in prison.

00:19:08.965 --> 00:19:10.200
JUSTIN KOSSLYN: Sorry,
I don't understand.

00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:12.580
It was a toothpaste that
said "squeeze Russia out

00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:13.130
of yourself?"

00:19:13.130 --> 00:19:14.046
ANDREI SOLDATOV: Yeah.

00:19:14.046 --> 00:19:16.990
IRINA BOROGRAN: Toothpaste and
squeeze Russia out of yourself.

00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:18.272
That's Russophobic.

00:19:18.272 --> 00:19:20.230
JUSTIN KOSSLYN: What is
it even saying, though?

00:19:20.230 --> 00:19:21.111
What does it mean?

00:19:21.111 --> 00:19:23.235
ANDREI SOLDATOV: Well,
nobody actually understands.

00:19:23.235 --> 00:19:25.570
IRINA BOROGRAN:
There was an allusion

00:19:25.570 --> 00:19:29.380
to some saying of
Russian writer Chekhov,

00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:30.667
that means you need to--

00:19:30.667 --> 00:19:32.500
ANDREI SOLDATOV: Squeeze
a slave out of you.

00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:34.930
IRINA BOROGRAN: Squeeze
the slave from yourself.

00:19:34.930 --> 00:19:37.010
But at the same time,
it's really stupid.

00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:37.810
It doesn't--

00:19:37.810 --> 00:19:38.470
JUSTIN KOSSLYN:
What does it mean?

00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:40.060
It means it got him
two years in prison.

00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:40.935
ANDREI SOLDATOV: Yes.

00:19:40.935 --> 00:19:41.840
JUSTIN KOSSLYN: Wow.

00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:46.061
Have you had near brushes with
those kind of experiences?

00:19:46.061 --> 00:19:47.560
ANDREI SOLDATOV:
Well we, as I said,

00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:51.890
we started many years ago, I
think it was 2000, 1999, 2000.

00:19:51.890 --> 00:19:55.260
And of course, back then--

00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:57.520
actually, it started
very early for us.

00:19:57.520 --> 00:20:01.570
Early in 2002, we got the very
first criminal investigation

00:20:01.570 --> 00:20:02.830
against us.

00:20:02.830 --> 00:20:07.690
And sometimes it's
really, I would say--

00:20:07.690 --> 00:20:08.970
well, you feel really nervous.

00:20:08.970 --> 00:20:12.200
Because these interrogations,
they are conducted in a prison,

00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:13.470
actually--

00:20:13.470 --> 00:20:14.380
just by chance.

00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:18.180
So you never know what
might happen to you next.

00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:21.320
And maybe you would stay
there, or maybe not.

00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:22.760
It's a big question.

00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:25.410
But I would say that if--

00:20:25.410 --> 00:20:29.070
well, if you tried to
understand how things changed,

00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:30.960
I would say that
today, the tactics

00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:32.580
became much more subtle.

00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:34.440
So back then, it was
mostly about targeting

00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:36.390
individual journalists.

00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:40.640
And now, it's about how to
deal with editors and owners

00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:44.880
of the media, which results in
the situation when you cannot

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:48.000
find a place to get
your stuff published.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.530
And you cannot say, look,
in a way, it's worse.

00:20:52.530 --> 00:20:55.230
Because when you have someone--

00:20:55.230 --> 00:20:58.290
well, a journalist--
targeted by the Kremlin,

00:20:58.290 --> 00:21:00.540
it means at least
with journalists,

00:21:00.540 --> 00:21:03.160
could apply to public.

00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:05.880
He might make his case
public, and say, look, I'm

00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:07.960
a victim of this
kind of pressure.

00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:09.960
But now, it'll all a kind
of management problem.

00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:12.010
It's between you
and your editor.

00:21:12.010 --> 00:21:12.200
JUSTIN KOSSLYN: Right.

00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:14.100
It's the same philosophy
where there is the cable,

00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:15.420
but there's also
the phone number.

00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:15.780
ANDREI SOLDATOV: Right.

00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:16.770
JUSTIN KOSSLYN: And
it's all kind of done--

00:21:16.770 --> 00:21:17.800
ANDREI SOLDATOV: It's manual.

00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:19.216
JUSTIN KOSSLYN:
Yeah, very manual.

00:21:19.216 --> 00:21:21.074
It's a good way
to think about it.

00:21:21.074 --> 00:21:22.740
And you mentioned
earlier that your book

00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:24.510
was published in the US.

00:21:24.510 --> 00:21:26.040
It was published
here before Russia?

00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:26.470
Is that correct?

00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:26.830
ANDREI SOLDATOV: Yeah.

00:21:26.830 --> 00:21:28.090
JUSTIN KOSSLYN: Why is that?

00:21:28.090 --> 00:21:30.070
ANDREI SOLDATOV: Because
Russian publishers,

00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:32.610
they were not very--

00:21:32.610 --> 00:21:34.410
they understood the risks.

00:21:34.410 --> 00:21:37.230
And because it's a
long story for us,

00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:41.580
so we started publishing
this stuff in the West,

00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:44.520
maybe in 2010, 2009.

00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:46.080
So we had experience.

00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:48.990
And it's really interesting
that Russian publications, they

00:21:48.990 --> 00:21:52.800
sometimes pick up
your stories, but only

00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:57.870
after they're published by
the Western publications.

00:21:57.870 --> 00:22:01.910
And they always ask to
maintain this byline

00:22:01.910 --> 00:22:04.440
that first time, this was
published in English, in say,

00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:05.239
"The Guardian."

00:22:05.239 --> 00:22:06.030
JUSTIN KOSSLYN: OK.

00:22:06.030 --> 00:22:08.830
ANDREI SOLDATOV: So it helps
them to shift responsibility,

00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:11.880
and to say, look, it was
already published somewhere.

00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:14.190
And the same goes
with the books.

00:22:14.190 --> 00:22:18.390
So they say, well,
maybe, one day we

00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:20.370
are happy to publish
your book, but first,

00:22:20.370 --> 00:22:21.780
get them published in the West.

00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:23.160
And actually that has happened.

00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:25.680
We got our book finally
published in Russia,

00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:29.810
but only after it was
published in the United States.

00:22:29.810 --> 00:22:32.310
JUSTIN KOSSLYN: So sort of a
boomerang, outside-in strategy.

00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:33.190
ANDREI SOLDATOV: Yes.

00:22:33.190 --> 00:22:34.710
JUSTIN KOSSLYN: And I'm
actually surprised to hear

00:22:34.710 --> 00:22:37.200
that you were able to publish
your book in Russia at all.

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:38.190
Why is that?

00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:40.065
ANDREI SOLDATOV: Maybe
because the first book

00:22:40.065 --> 00:22:41.830
became a bestseller, actually.

00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:44.077
It actually made a lot of
money for the publisher.

00:22:44.077 --> 00:22:45.410
JUSTIN KOSSLYN: Congratulations.

00:22:45.410 --> 00:22:48.490
ANDREI SOLDATOV: And not for us.

00:22:48.490 --> 00:22:49.782
JUSTIN KOSSLYN: Condolences.

00:22:49.782 --> 00:22:52.260
ANDREI SOLDATOV: But it
was a really strange moment

00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:56.610
in Russian history, because
it was September of 2011.

00:22:56.610 --> 00:22:59.420
And the book was just published.

00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:02.790
And the FSB was not very happy,
so they sent some letters.

00:23:02.790 --> 00:23:05.830
Actually, they sent some people
to-- for some strange reason,

00:23:05.830 --> 00:23:08.950
they decided to visit
the printing house.

00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:10.369
Why?

00:23:10.369 --> 00:23:11.160
I still don't know.

00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:12.180
JUSTIN KOSSLYN: So
security services

00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:13.810
showed up at the
printing house in Russia.

00:23:13.810 --> 00:23:15.510
ANDREI SOLDATOV: Yes, not at
the offices of the publisher,

00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:18.150
but in the printing house,
and ask crazy questions, like,

00:23:18.150 --> 00:23:20.130
who paid for the
printing of the book?

00:23:20.130 --> 00:23:23.610
And everybody said,
OK, it's the publisher.

00:23:23.610 --> 00:23:25.410
And we were really nervous.

00:23:25.410 --> 00:23:28.020
But then we got these
Moscow protests.

00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:32.190
So the FSB, very soon, they
had some other things to do.

00:23:32.190 --> 00:23:34.430
They needed to deal with
this political crisis.

00:23:34.430 --> 00:23:35.400
JUSTIN KOSSLYN: And
did they ever come back

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:36.485
to the printing house?

00:23:36.485 --> 00:23:38.730
ANDREI SOLDATOV: No, they
forgot about it completely.

00:23:38.730 --> 00:23:40.230
JUSTIN KOSSLYN:
Hey, whatever works.

00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:41.140
I guess it's all people.

00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:42.360
And that's one of
the themes, I think

00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:44.234
of the points you've
been making-- that there

00:23:44.234 --> 00:23:45.630
is a technology element.

00:23:45.630 --> 00:23:48.060
But it really is as much
manual as it is automatic.

00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:48.220
ANDREI SOLDATOV: Absolutely.

00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:48.870
Yeah.

00:23:48.870 --> 00:23:50.310
JUSTIN KOSSLYN: So looking
forward a little bit--

00:23:50.310 --> 00:23:51.640
and we're going to
pause in a few minutes.

00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:54.490
So if folks have questions as we
go, just be jotting them down.

00:23:54.490 --> 00:23:56.656
And then we'll open it up
for any audience questions

00:23:56.656 --> 00:23:57.330
momentarily.

00:23:57.330 --> 00:23:58.890
But before we do
that, I just want

00:23:58.890 --> 00:24:01.420
to turn to the
future a little bit.

00:24:01.420 --> 00:24:02.700
Where do you see things going?

00:24:05.532 --> 00:24:06.990
IRINA BOROGRAN: We
are journalists,

00:24:06.990 --> 00:24:10.750
and we had to predict
future and always failed.

00:24:10.750 --> 00:24:14.460
But even one things is
absolutely predictable--

00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:17.680
that Vladimir Putin will be
the new Russian president

00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:18.180
next year.

00:24:18.180 --> 00:24:20.190
ANDREI SOLDATOV: Next year.

00:24:20.190 --> 00:24:24.590
But I think that if you
try to see the whole thing,

00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:27.870
maybe we still have
some source for hope.

00:24:27.870 --> 00:24:30.530
Because it looks like
with the internet,

00:24:30.530 --> 00:24:32.580
the Kremlin faces a
formidable challenge.

00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:37.710
Because historically, the whole
Russian history, actually,

00:24:37.710 --> 00:24:41.970
has been defined by
a hierarchical order.

00:24:41.970 --> 00:24:46.190
We always had someone on the
very top calling the shots.

00:24:46.190 --> 00:24:48.450
It was maybe the czar,
or maybe the emperor,

00:24:48.450 --> 00:24:51.240
or maybe the leader of
the Communist Party.

00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:54.100
But right now, we are
dealing with a situation

00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:58.870
where we have the network,
which is, by definition,

00:24:58.870 --> 00:25:00.720
a horizontal creature.

00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:05.760
And it looks like the Kremlin
has some problems understanding

00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:08.070
the nature of the network.

00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:13.250
Just three years ago, we
had this excellent example.

00:25:13.250 --> 00:25:15.420
There was a case against
this guy, Navalny,

00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:17.970
and he was about
to be sent to jail.

00:25:17.970 --> 00:25:22.470
And some of his people wanted
to mobilize people to protest.

00:25:22.470 --> 00:25:25.080
So we launched a protest
group on Facebook.

00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:29.160
And this group was immediately
taken down by Facebook

00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:31.380
under the request of
the Russian government.

00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:34.890
And immediately, we got
a lot of people outraged

00:25:34.890 --> 00:25:38.610
by this story launching
their own pages,

00:25:38.610 --> 00:25:43.260
asking people to get to a
particular place in Moscow.

00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:46.300
And as a result, we
got tens of thousands

00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:48.605
of people protesting
on the Moscow streets.

00:25:48.605 --> 00:25:49.980
JUSTIN KOSSLYN:
Tens of thousands

00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:51.270
of people spontaneously.

00:25:51.270 --> 00:25:53.860
ANDREI SOLDATOV:
Spontaneously, just like that.

00:25:53.860 --> 00:25:56.340
So I think these things
are still very difficult

00:25:56.340 --> 00:25:57.990
for the Kremlin to understand.

00:25:57.990 --> 00:26:00.120
And it gives us some hope.

00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:01.710
IRINA BOROGRAN:
Putin still believes

00:26:01.710 --> 00:26:04.540
that the internet is ruled
by some guys on the top,

00:26:04.540 --> 00:26:05.917
and he said that it is the CIA.

00:26:05.917 --> 00:26:07.250
ANDREI SOLDATOV: Yeah, actually.

00:26:07.250 --> 00:26:07.650
JUSTIN KOSSLYN: Really.

00:26:07.650 --> 00:26:08.860
ANDREI SOLDATOV: Yeah,
he actually just--

00:26:08.860 --> 00:26:10.720
IRINA BOROGRAN: He
said that the CIA--

00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:14.538
that the internet
was a CIA creation.

00:26:14.538 --> 00:26:16.170
JUSTIN KOSSLYN: Hmm.

00:26:16.170 --> 00:26:19.240
And in general, how do they
think about technology?

00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:21.840
So that's one data point.

00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:23.490
How do you think,
five years from now,

00:26:23.490 --> 00:26:25.875
they'll be conceptualizing
the internet?

00:26:25.875 --> 00:26:28.500
ANDREI SOLDATOV: Well, in our
business, and for the media,

00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:29.930
it's all about social media.

00:26:29.930 --> 00:26:32.430
And we already have
some interesting things.

00:26:32.430 --> 00:26:36.570
But people tried to abandon
the idea of domain names

00:26:36.570 --> 00:26:38.310
for the media.

00:26:38.310 --> 00:26:40.900
Actually, they moved
to social media.

00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:43.170
So they have some recent
project, [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:43.170 --> 00:26:46.310
project, which was launched
solely on social media.

00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:48.750
They have a page on Facebook,
a page on VKontakte,

00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:51.720
and something on
medium.com, that's all.

00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:53.640
And it's not only
because we believe

00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:57.210
in the idea of social media, but
also because it's more secure.

00:26:57.210 --> 00:26:59.580
Once you have a website
and a domain name,

00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:00.840
it might be easily blocked.

00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:02.680
You might get some visitors.

00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:05.350
And if you have everything
based on social media,

00:27:05.350 --> 00:27:07.650
that provides you
with some opportunity.

00:27:07.650 --> 00:27:09.720
And simultaneously,
some people who

00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:11.490
still believe in the
idea of domain names,

00:27:11.490 --> 00:27:15.720
they think that now, maybe
it's time to move to Google.

00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:19.990
Because it's also a big issue,
for say, for the country

00:27:19.990 --> 00:27:21.600
or for dying regimes.

00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:24.930
One thing is to block the
website of a particular media.

00:27:24.930 --> 00:27:28.980
It's easy, especially if it's
Russian registered or it's--

00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:32.520
But if it's based on-- it's
actually, physically on Google,

00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:34.020
it means if you
want to block it,

00:27:34.020 --> 00:27:35.730
you need to deal with
the whole Google.

00:27:35.730 --> 00:27:39.490
And it's such a sensitive
thing for many that even

00:27:39.490 --> 00:27:41.580
in the countries
of Central Asia--

00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:45.270
and they're usually
not that subtle--

00:27:45.270 --> 00:27:46.680
they're still hesitant.

00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:49.380
And they do not know what to
do with this new phenomenon,

00:27:49.380 --> 00:27:52.080
that many media might
be physically based

00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:53.470
on Google services.

00:27:53.470 --> 00:27:55.940
They just don't know how
to deal with this problem.

00:27:55.940 --> 00:27:57.360
So maybe that
provides us, again,

00:27:57.360 --> 00:28:02.780
some sense of, well,
maybe some sort of hope.

00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:04.530
JUSTIN KOSSLYN: Do you
foresee any changes

00:28:04.530 --> 00:28:07.464
to the policies, or the laws,
or the enforcements around that?

00:28:07.464 --> 00:28:08.880
ANDREI SOLDATOV:
Well, the problem

00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:10.740
is that we have this problem--

00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:14.680
the idea of localization.

00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:16.210
The idea that--

00:28:16.210 --> 00:28:18.330
I hate this term, but--

00:28:18.330 --> 00:28:20.550
the balkanization
of the internet.

00:28:20.550 --> 00:28:23.640
Unfortunately, it's such a
great idea for many, especially

00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:24.480
in Russia and China.

00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:26.080
They love the idea
of-- they brand it

00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:27.414
as a digital sovereignty.

00:28:27.414 --> 00:28:28.580
JUSTIN KOSSLYN: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:29.788
ANDREI SOLDATOV: Sovereignty.

00:28:29.788 --> 00:28:32.130
JUSTIN KOSSLYN: Sovereignty,
digital sovereignty.

00:28:32.130 --> 00:28:34.830
ANDREI SOLDATOV: And
basically, it's about borders.

00:28:34.830 --> 00:28:36.720
Like, we have our territory.

00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:40.840
And it's limited by borders.

00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:45.110
We need to have exactly the
same thing on the internet.

00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:48.930
And the idea is that if
you have some service--

00:28:48.930 --> 00:28:52.440
it might be Facebook,
Twitter, anything,

00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:57.330
Google-- you need
to have all servers.

00:28:57.330 --> 00:29:00.770
We have the Russian, with this
particular country, citizens'

00:29:00.770 --> 00:29:04.800
data on this territory, just
to be able to access it easily,

00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:07.870
and to manipulate,
maybe, with this data.

00:29:07.870 --> 00:29:10.590
And unfortunately,
it's a very I would

00:29:10.590 --> 00:29:12.960
say appealing idea
to many, because it's

00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:14.670
something about patriotism.

00:29:14.670 --> 00:29:16.980
Yes, for example, we
were at some meeting

00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:19.629
with the Russian officials
and they said very openly,

00:29:19.629 --> 00:29:21.420
yes, we are very grateful
to the Americans.

00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:22.670
They invented the whole thing.

00:29:22.670 --> 00:29:26.700
But now it's time for
us to control our space.

00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:32.290
It's about our sense
of a national state.

00:29:32.290 --> 00:29:34.650
It's a great opportunity
for the security services

00:29:34.650 --> 00:29:37.672
to get direct access
to users' data.

00:29:37.672 --> 00:29:43.510
Because now, they
are able to spy

00:29:43.510 --> 00:29:46.920
on the services located abroad.

00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:52.715
Because they can't find
direct access to it.

00:29:52.715 --> 00:29:54.465
JUSTIN KOSSLYN: So
last question before we

00:29:54.465 --> 00:29:55.800
turn to the audience--

00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:57.130
overall, are you an optimist?

00:29:57.130 --> 00:29:58.140
A pessimist?

00:29:58.140 --> 00:30:01.890
Do you think that the internet
will be a force for good five,

00:30:01.890 --> 00:30:02.640
10 years from now?

00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:05.680
Or do you think we're sort of
in this unique window in history

00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:06.790
that's going to close.

00:30:06.790 --> 00:30:08.331
ANDREI SOLDATOV:
Well, you know, when

00:30:08.331 --> 00:30:11.680
we started writing our book, our
American publisher said, look,

00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:13.689
you need to add something
optimistic in the end

00:30:13.689 --> 00:30:14.230
of your book.

00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:15.890
Because otherwise,
why to read it?

00:30:15.890 --> 00:30:20.330
And finally, we
thought wow, maybe

00:30:20.330 --> 00:30:21.970
there is something in his idea.

00:30:21.970 --> 00:30:24.630
But seriously, no,
we are optimists.

00:30:24.630 --> 00:30:30.700
We believe that right now,
we have these opportunities.

00:30:30.700 --> 00:30:34.480
We can publish very
sensitive stories,

00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:36.910
and it's all thanks
to technology.

00:30:36.910 --> 00:30:39.790
And it looks like
for the Kremlin,

00:30:39.790 --> 00:30:43.060
they might know some tricks,
but it's really difficult for us

00:30:43.060 --> 00:30:45.760
to catch up with
development of technologies.

00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:49.390
And also, the problem is--
which also gives me some hope--

00:30:49.390 --> 00:30:51.940
just this year, Vladimir
Putin signed a new information

00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:53.110
security doctrine.

00:30:53.110 --> 00:30:54.860
And it's essentially Soviet.

00:30:54.860 --> 00:30:58.300
It actually has one thing,
that before introducing

00:30:58.300 --> 00:31:01.420
some new technologies,
telecommunication companies

00:31:01.420 --> 00:31:03.790
should first consult
with the secret services.

00:31:03.790 --> 00:31:06.460
And we knew that actually,
back in the Soviet times,

00:31:06.460 --> 00:31:08.770
that destroyed the
telecommunication market

00:31:08.770 --> 00:31:09.800
in our country.

00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:13.600
Because if you need to ask
someone who is wise enough

00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:17.380
to think about security, well,
it just slows down everything.

00:31:17.380 --> 00:31:19.057
And that gives us hope.

00:31:19.057 --> 00:31:20.890
JUSTIN KOSSLYN: How
does that give you hope?

00:31:20.890 --> 00:31:21.660
That seems like a--

00:31:21.660 --> 00:31:22.120
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:23.290
ANDREI SOLDATOV: Well, no.

00:31:23.290 --> 00:31:26.830
It's more in terms of that
it would slow down the, say,

00:31:26.830 --> 00:31:28.360
internet business
in our country.

00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:34.510
But in terms of given the,
well, the forces of control

00:31:34.510 --> 00:31:39.250
some new means, I
think now all this--

00:31:42.940 --> 00:31:46.004
I would say for them, it's
just difficult to catch up.

00:31:46.004 --> 00:31:46.920
JUSTIN KOSSLYN: I see.

00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:48.220
ANDREI SOLDATOV: They're
always a bit slow.

00:31:48.220 --> 00:31:48.490
JUSTIN KOSSLYN: I see.

00:31:48.490 --> 00:31:50.699
It's evidence that the
mindset has not been evolving.

00:31:50.699 --> 00:31:51.615
ANDREI SOLDATOV: Yeah.

00:31:51.615 --> 00:31:52.730
JUSTIN KOSSLYN: Got it.

00:31:52.730 --> 00:31:55.647
ANDREI SOLDATOV: When
you need to choose what's

00:31:55.647 --> 00:31:56.730
the most important thing--

00:31:56.730 --> 00:31:58.854
the development of technology
or security-- and you

00:31:58.854 --> 00:32:01.000
always choose security
that means that you

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:02.280
lose something very important.

00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:05.420
We live in a world where
development of technology

00:32:05.420 --> 00:32:06.880
is an essential thing.

00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:10.420
And if you always trade it
for security or for the ghost

00:32:10.420 --> 00:32:11.620
of security, you lose.

00:32:11.620 --> 00:32:12.150
JUSTIN KOSSLYN: Got it.

00:32:12.150 --> 00:32:14.441
You can't-- it's not going
to be viable to keep up with

00:32:14.441 --> 00:32:17.010
the international technology
scene if that's the approach.

00:32:17.010 --> 00:32:18.730
What do you think, Irina?

00:32:18.730 --> 00:32:21.630
IRINA BOROGRAN: I think
that Kremlin is always

00:32:21.630 --> 00:32:26.220
losing to the technologies
because the Kremlin doesn't

00:32:26.220 --> 00:32:28.055
understand the nature
of the internet.

00:32:28.055 --> 00:32:30.230
And that is very
advantageous for us,

00:32:30.230 --> 00:32:32.015
very good and big
advantage for us.

00:32:32.015 --> 00:32:33.640
JUSTIN KOSSLYN: Well,
thank you so much

00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:36.100
for the work that you do,
for sharing it with us today,

00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:38.410
and for taking the time
to answer these questions.

00:32:38.410 --> 00:32:39.580
And I'll turn it over now.

00:32:39.580 --> 00:32:40.955
But let's do a
round of applause.

00:32:40.955 --> 00:32:41.595
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:41.595 --> 00:32:42.678
IRINA BOROGRAN: Thank you.

00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:47.920
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:32:47.920 --> 00:32:49.940
So speaking of
digital sovereignty,

00:32:49.940 --> 00:32:53.060
what are your thoughts, and
what's the sentiment coming out

00:32:53.060 --> 00:32:57.290
of Russia around the
"fake news" phenomenon

00:32:57.290 --> 00:33:02.605
that has essentially determined
the elections of the US?

00:33:02.605 --> 00:33:03.980
IRINA BOROGRAN:
Firstly, we don't

00:33:03.980 --> 00:33:09.230
think that Russian fake
news determined that

00:33:09.230 --> 00:33:10.850
as a result of the US election.

00:33:10.850 --> 00:33:14.300
We believe that
Trump was elected

00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:17.270
because of [INAUDIBLE] reasons.

00:33:17.270 --> 00:33:19.910
And Americans wanted
to believe him.

00:33:19.910 --> 00:33:23.470
But of course
there's this machine,

00:33:23.470 --> 00:33:27.500
which produced fake
news, trolls, and so on,

00:33:27.500 --> 00:33:30.530
to some extent effective,
and especially in terms

00:33:30.530 --> 00:33:32.900
of disrupting discussion
on the internet

00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:38.210
and to dissemination of cynicism
among the internet users.

00:33:41.050 --> 00:33:43.970
What is the modus operandi
of the Kremlin in this era?

00:33:43.970 --> 00:33:50.330
The armies of trolls are
spreading negative information

00:33:50.330 --> 00:33:55.280
about everything, about
parties, about representatives

00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:58.130
of different groups
of population,

00:33:58.130 --> 00:33:59.900
about political leaders.

00:33:59.900 --> 00:34:04.940
And it puts you in a
very vulnerable position.

00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:08.150
You feel that you
can't believe anybody.

00:34:08.150 --> 00:34:12.080
And so it doesn't matter who
will be your new president,

00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:17.139
or maybe the old, strong leader
is better than any new leader.

00:34:17.139 --> 00:34:19.969
That's what they're doing.

00:34:19.969 --> 00:34:22.520
But I think that
they can oppose.

00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:28.139
I mean, the democracy can oppose
to these things developing

00:34:28.139 --> 00:34:35.150
good mass media, good quality
and progressive mass media.

00:34:35.150 --> 00:34:37.909
That is the way how
it could be, how

00:34:37.909 --> 00:34:41.340
we can combat these propaganda.

00:34:41.340 --> 00:34:42.840
ANDREI SOLDATOV:
And maybe the thing

00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:44.780
is, which we need to
understand, that this all

00:34:44.780 --> 00:34:46.123
started in our country.

00:34:46.123 --> 00:34:48.980
And firstly, the
first target was

00:34:48.980 --> 00:34:51.920
Russian political opposition
and independent journalism.

00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:56.810
And unfortunately, it was first
very successful in Russia,

00:34:56.810 --> 00:35:00.300
mostly because we still are
a very confused society,

00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:03.220
a post-soviet,
post-totalitarian society.

00:35:03.220 --> 00:35:06.350
We have a lack of
trust in anything,

00:35:06.350 --> 00:35:08.670
especially in
political institutions.

00:35:08.670 --> 00:35:12.134
And it left you,
when you think of it,

00:35:12.134 --> 00:35:13.550
it left you with
the idea that you

00:35:13.550 --> 00:35:18.500
have the general public, the
population, and the leader,

00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:20.690
and that's all--
nothing in between.

00:35:20.690 --> 00:35:23.540
And that was used by
the Kremlin to the full.

00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:29.000
Because in this case, you think
this guy, he's strong enough.

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:30.350
We know who he is.

00:35:30.350 --> 00:35:32.570
And we do not know
all other guys.

00:35:32.570 --> 00:35:34.820
So it's better to
keep with this guy.

00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:36.440
And it looks like
Putin just tried

00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:39.500
to export this idea
of complete distrust

00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:41.840
in institutions to
the United States.

00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:43.990
I do not believe
that it was born,

00:35:43.990 --> 00:35:45.920
it was invented by Putin here.

00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:48.020
I mean, you already
had some basis

00:35:48.020 --> 00:35:51.890
for this kind of mistrust in
the establishment, in the media.

00:35:51.890 --> 00:35:54.460
So what they tried to do, they
tried to exploit this feeling.

00:35:54.460 --> 00:35:56.270
They added some fuel.

00:35:56.270 --> 00:36:02.180
And unfortunately, it was,
well, successful to some degree.

00:36:02.180 --> 00:36:05.630
As a journalist, I'm a bit
skeptical that it completely

00:36:05.630 --> 00:36:06.770
changes the game.

00:36:06.770 --> 00:36:08.187
But of course, we
added some fuel.

00:36:08.187 --> 00:36:10.228
JUSTIN KOSSLYN: So if I'm
hearing you right, just

00:36:10.228 --> 00:36:12.050
to summarize, it was
as much about changing

00:36:12.050 --> 00:36:14.690
the level of overall
trust in our society

00:36:14.690 --> 00:36:16.820
over a long period
of time as it was

00:36:16.820 --> 00:36:18.350
about any particular election.

00:36:18.350 --> 00:36:19.183
IRINA BOROGRAN: Yes.

00:36:19.183 --> 00:36:21.250
IRINA BOROGRAN: Yeah.

00:36:21.250 --> 00:36:23.860
AUDIENCE: I have a question
kind of on the same lines.

00:36:23.860 --> 00:36:27.440
So I was at the Oxford Internet
Institute back in 2010,

00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:30.506
kind of studying the beginnings
of computational propaganda.

00:36:30.506 --> 00:36:32.380
And today, I have friends
who are journalists

00:36:32.380 --> 00:36:35.540
at NBC, big news outlets, who
are being tasked with covering

00:36:35.540 --> 00:36:36.840
these types of things.

00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:40.190
And I get questions from them,
like, is this actually real?

00:36:40.190 --> 00:36:42.080
And so considering that--

00:36:42.080 --> 00:36:43.620
and this is their job--

00:36:43.620 --> 00:36:47.640
and so considering that
you've seen this in Russia

00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:50.300
many times in terms of
disinformation campaigns,

00:36:50.300 --> 00:36:53.330
are there any trends that
you've seen of evolve in Russia

00:36:53.330 --> 00:36:56.750
that you think could
make the leap to the US?

00:36:56.750 --> 00:37:00.062
ANDREI SOLDATOV: Well, to be
honest it looks like they--

00:37:00.062 --> 00:37:06.560
it started in the West in
2014, mostly, and because

00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:08.370
of the annexation of Crimea.

00:37:08.370 --> 00:37:10.700
And firstly, the first
target was Ukraine.

00:37:10.700 --> 00:37:13.170
And it was easier, because
we share the same language,

00:37:13.170 --> 00:37:17.210
the same prejudices, the
same theories about how

00:37:17.210 --> 00:37:20.130
we feel about the
West, and our history.

00:37:20.130 --> 00:37:22.520
So you can play the same
tricks for the Russian

00:37:22.520 --> 00:37:24.220
and for Ukrainians.

00:37:24.220 --> 00:37:27.680
Then they tried something
in Eastern Europe.

00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:31.700
To some extent, it was really
successful, once again,

00:37:31.700 --> 00:37:33.830
because lots of people
in Eastern Europe

00:37:33.830 --> 00:37:37.705
feel a bit, I would
say, fooled by the West.

00:37:37.705 --> 00:37:41.510
They were promised a lot
and it was never delivered.

00:37:41.510 --> 00:37:45.005
And finally, they tried
in the United Kingdom.

00:37:45.005 --> 00:37:46.600
And they tried through
"The Guardian."

00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:48.140
And they immediately
got spotted,

00:37:48.140 --> 00:37:50.900
so it was not a
big success, mostly

00:37:50.900 --> 00:37:52.690
for some language problems.

00:37:52.690 --> 00:37:55.190
And of course, it was
mostly because people

00:37:55.190 --> 00:37:58.250
who, back then, were hired
to do these kind of things,

00:37:58.250 --> 00:38:00.310
were Russians, based
in Saint Petersburg

00:38:00.310 --> 00:38:01.590
and some other places.

00:38:01.590 --> 00:38:05.600
But unfortunately,
it's evolved with time.

00:38:05.600 --> 00:38:09.320
And now, it looks like
they got some people

00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:12.560
based in these countries who
are at least partly natives.

00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:15.590
So they know how
to speak and how

00:38:15.590 --> 00:38:17.270
to address the issues
which are really

00:38:17.270 --> 00:38:18.770
important for this
particular region

00:38:18.770 --> 00:38:20.210
or this particular district.

00:38:20.210 --> 00:38:22.880
And they use this kind of thing.

00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:26.790
Still, I do not believe
that it's that effective.

00:38:26.790 --> 00:38:34.340
But what makes them particularly
crucial in the Kremlin's

00:38:34.340 --> 00:38:38.330
propaganda thing, that we
have this strange distinction,

00:38:38.330 --> 00:38:40.700
that we have the Russian
bureaucracy, which is,

00:38:40.700 --> 00:38:43.370
by definition, extremely slow.

00:38:43.370 --> 00:38:45.440
And it's not only
about Foreign Ministry.

00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:47.420
It's also about
Russian television.

00:38:47.420 --> 00:38:50.270
It's also about Secret
Services to some degree.

00:38:50.270 --> 00:38:52.300
But also, we've got
informal actors.

00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:54.920
We have people who
officially have nothing

00:38:54.920 --> 00:38:57.160
to do with the government.

00:38:57.160 --> 00:39:01.190
And on the one hand, it
gives the Kremlin a sense

00:39:01.190 --> 00:39:03.920
that they always could deny
responsibility in what we

00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:07.430
do all the time, but also it
makes these groups much more

00:39:07.430 --> 00:39:09.080
flexible and adventurous.

00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:12.590
Because they, unlike
the bureaucracy,

00:39:12.590 --> 00:39:15.360
they have direct
access to the Kremlin.

00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:17.100
And they can always
ask, look, is it

00:39:17.100 --> 00:39:20.900
fine we do that, or maybe
next day we can try these?

00:39:20.900 --> 00:39:23.330
So it's actually we
are dealing with a very

00:39:23.330 --> 00:39:26.210
flexible and adventurous
community of people

00:39:26.210 --> 00:39:29.060
who are really committed
to do these things.

00:39:29.060 --> 00:39:33.982
Because actually, the risks
are still very low for them.

00:39:33.982 --> 00:39:35.690
JUSTIN KOSSLYN: So I
guess the answer is,

00:39:35.690 --> 00:39:37.248
it's gotten harder to tell.

00:39:37.248 --> 00:39:38.682
ANDREI SOLDATOV: Yeah.

00:39:38.682 --> 00:39:40.760
IRINA BOROGRAN:
Anything to add, Irina?

00:39:40.760 --> 00:39:41.720
IRINA BOROGRAN: No.

00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:43.010
JUSTIN KOSSLYN: Anything
you want to add?

00:39:43.010 --> 00:39:43.330
ANDREI SOLDATOV: No.

00:39:43.330 --> 00:39:44.121
JUSTIN KOSSLYN: OK.

00:39:44.121 --> 00:39:45.005
Please.

00:39:45.005 --> 00:39:47.070
AUDIENCE: It's somewhat
ironic that today

00:39:47.070 --> 00:39:49.210
is Putin's 65th birthday.

00:39:49.210 --> 00:39:51.590
And as "The Economist"
published this morning,

00:39:51.590 --> 00:39:53.810
he has no intention
of stepping down,

00:39:53.810 --> 00:39:55.564
as I think you pointed out.

00:39:55.564 --> 00:39:57.730
And of course, this article,
which just this morning

00:39:57.730 --> 00:39:59.910
was, of course,
talking about Navalny.

00:39:59.910 --> 00:40:03.020
And so I guess two parts of the
question from your perspective

00:40:03.020 --> 00:40:05.975
is, what is his future,
Navalny's, given

00:40:05.975 --> 00:40:08.750
how much of an uproar he's
made, particularly in the West?

00:40:08.750 --> 00:40:11.750
You know he's on "60
Minutes" a handful of times.

00:40:11.750 --> 00:40:14.360
So where is he
going, or is he not?

00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:17.240
And then where-- because a
lot of I think what he's done

00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:20.270
has been to catalyze somewhat
of the youth, and millennials,

00:40:20.270 --> 00:40:21.420
and younger people.

00:40:21.420 --> 00:40:24.530
So what role will younger people
play in the next five years?

00:40:24.530 --> 00:40:25.160
JUSTIN KOSSLYN: And
actually, it might even

00:40:25.160 --> 00:40:27.535
be worth just giving a bit of
quick context for the group

00:40:27.535 --> 00:40:29.125
on who he is and
the work he's done.

00:40:29.125 --> 00:40:31.250
IRINA BOROGRAN: Navalny is
an opposition politician

00:40:31.250 --> 00:40:36.140
who adopted a new way of
doing politics in Russia.

00:40:36.140 --> 00:40:41.360
As you know, today in Russia,
opposition politicians

00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:44.320
can now access to the media--

00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:47.660
traditional mass media, TV
channels, radio stations,

00:40:47.660 --> 00:40:50.730
and newspapers, and
they could use website--

00:40:50.730 --> 00:40:54.350
because all-- most of them are
under the Kremlin's control

00:40:54.350 --> 00:40:57.110
or under the control of
pro-Kremlin oligarchs.

00:40:57.110 --> 00:41:05.210
So he started to gain popularity
doing [INAUDIBLE] on that.

00:41:05.210 --> 00:41:10.630
He set up a special
channel on YouTube.

00:41:10.630 --> 00:41:13.730
There's another
channel on YouTube.

00:41:13.730 --> 00:41:17.600
He started-- in fact, he started
with Twitter, and YouTube

00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:22.350
channel, and his own websites.

00:41:22.350 --> 00:41:25.880
And three years ago, he
got a lot of popularity,

00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:28.860
which was even bigger.

00:41:28.860 --> 00:41:33.030
It became bigger in 2017 for
I don't know what reasons.

00:41:33.030 --> 00:41:36.845
Maybe because of
a financial crisis

00:41:36.845 --> 00:41:39.780
in Russia and bad
economic situation.

00:41:39.780 --> 00:41:44.840
Maybe because the authoritative
regime became stronger

00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:47.105
than it was, than it used to be.

00:41:47.105 --> 00:41:59.300
But his videos usually get
millions of viewers, tens,

00:41:59.300 --> 00:42:01.640
in fact, tens of
millions viewers.

00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:03.190
JUSTIN KOSSLYN: Tens of millions
of viewers on a single YouTube

00:42:03.190 --> 00:42:03.695
video.

00:42:03.695 --> 00:42:05.990
ANDREI SOLDATOV: Yeah,
so that's a great thing.

00:42:05.990 --> 00:42:10.820
And when we had the last
mass protest in Moscow,

00:42:10.820 --> 00:42:13.170
Navalny was arrested.

00:42:13.170 --> 00:42:18.110
But any case, we got--

00:42:18.110 --> 00:42:23.300
there were tens of thousands
of people on the streets.

00:42:23.300 --> 00:42:28.700
And many of them were
students, and even schoolboys

00:42:28.700 --> 00:42:29.480
and schoolgirls.

00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:32.630
That was really
unusual for Russians,

00:42:32.630 --> 00:42:37.670
because previously, we've
seen only people who's

00:42:37.670 --> 00:42:39.350
older than 20.

00:42:39.350 --> 00:42:42.680
ANDREI SOLDATOV: And maybe,
answering your question,

00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:45.670
the interesting thing now
is that previously, Navalny

00:42:45.670 --> 00:42:47.250
based all his activity online.

00:42:47.250 --> 00:42:49.390
It was always about
something online.

00:42:49.390 --> 00:42:53.760
And right now, he started
building his network offline.

00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:58.860
And surprisingly,
it's quite successful.

00:42:58.860 --> 00:43:01.530
When we got the latest
protest, Navalny

00:43:01.530 --> 00:43:04.320
tried to organize and to
enlist people in the regions.

00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:06.300
And we got protests in 80 towns.

00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:07.009
Which is really--

00:43:07.009 --> 00:43:07.799
JUSTIN KOSSLYN: 80?

00:43:07.799 --> 00:43:08.640
ANDREI SOLDATOV: 80.

00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:11.964
So it's really big, because
there's a usual theory

00:43:11.964 --> 00:43:14.130
and a traditional theory
about the Russian political

00:43:14.130 --> 00:43:18.240
opposition is, yes, you
have some people voting

00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:22.620
for you in big towns, but the
rest of Russia doesn't care.

00:43:22.620 --> 00:43:24.390
And they support Putin.

00:43:24.390 --> 00:43:25.690
It's not the case now.

00:43:25.690 --> 00:43:27.690
It's a big, new development.

00:43:27.690 --> 00:43:31.170
And I think he will invest more
and more resources, and more

00:43:31.170 --> 00:43:33.480
of his time, and of
his people's time,

00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:36.150
into trying to build his
network in the regions.

00:43:36.150 --> 00:43:38.040
And as I said, that's
quite effective.

00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:39.456
It's really
interesting what might

00:43:39.456 --> 00:43:42.330
happen to him and to his
ideas, when he actually

00:43:42.330 --> 00:43:46.410
started this move, this
shift from the online world

00:43:46.410 --> 00:43:48.260
to the offline world.

00:43:48.260 --> 00:43:50.040
Of course, there
are some problems,

00:43:50.040 --> 00:43:52.560
because it's a very
traditional way

00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:54.150
of building a
political party, which

00:43:54.150 --> 00:43:56.370
means that you need
to be ready to answer

00:43:56.370 --> 00:44:00.212
some traditional questions,
like what you think

00:44:00.212 --> 00:44:02.295
about the economic situation,
political situation,

00:44:02.295 --> 00:44:04.630
I don't know,
Crimea, many things.

00:44:04.630 --> 00:44:08.010
And he is not that ready.

00:44:08.010 --> 00:44:10.090
But still, there
is some potential.

00:44:10.090 --> 00:44:11.465
IRINA BOROGRAN:
At the moment, he

00:44:11.465 --> 00:44:14.510
is in the detention
center, was detained

00:44:14.510 --> 00:44:17.783
two days ago for 20 days.

00:44:17.783 --> 00:44:18.866
JUSTIN KOSSLYN: Thank you.

00:44:18.866 --> 00:44:20.654
[INAUDIBLE]

00:44:20.654 --> 00:44:22.320
AUDIENCE: In the
beginning of your talk,

00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:25.290
you mentioned that there
are very few things that

00:44:25.290 --> 00:44:27.460
could resonate with
the general public

00:44:27.460 --> 00:44:30.120
when it comes to censorship.

00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:33.060
Do you feel like there is
a cultural shift happening

00:44:33.060 --> 00:44:38.778
in Russian society, where
people are starting to respect

00:44:38.778 --> 00:44:40.760
open freedom of speech more?

00:44:40.760 --> 00:44:44.220
Or is it still mostly about
just accessing the BitTorrents

00:44:44.220 --> 00:44:45.960
and pornography?

00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:46.710
This is one thing.

00:44:46.710 --> 00:44:50.940
And another thing, the topic of
our talk today, surveillance,

00:44:50.940 --> 00:44:52.590
censorship and
beyond, and I wanted

00:44:52.590 --> 00:44:54.860
to ask you a little bit
about the beyond part.

00:44:54.860 --> 00:44:58.020
Do you feel like part of the
strategy of the government when

00:44:58.020 --> 00:45:01.450
it comes to
censorship is to make

00:45:01.450 --> 00:45:05.010
the community
complacent with it,

00:45:05.010 --> 00:45:09.180
doing it through the
idea of censorship

00:45:09.180 --> 00:45:15.450
being necessary to control the
country, to fight terrorism,

00:45:15.450 --> 00:45:20.200
and to make sure Russia
grows in a stable fashion?

00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:21.750
ANDREI SOLDATOV: I will try to--

00:45:21.750 --> 00:45:23.340
it's actually the
interesting thing,

00:45:23.340 --> 00:45:26.520
but there is a way to answer
both of your questions.

00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:30.616
And one, it looks
like five years ago,

00:45:30.616 --> 00:45:31.990
when they introduced
this system,

00:45:31.990 --> 00:45:33.450
they're trying to
play some tricks,

00:45:33.450 --> 00:45:35.330
like we are protecting children.

00:45:35.330 --> 00:45:36.630
We are doing things.

00:45:36.630 --> 00:45:38.400
They're actually
just doing exactly

00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:41.224
the same thing that was first
introduced by the British.

00:45:41.224 --> 00:45:43.140
So in a way, they imitate
the British approach

00:45:43.140 --> 00:45:44.760
to internet filtering.

00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:46.670
And it looks like
some years ago,

00:45:46.670 --> 00:45:48.630
actually two years
ago, they completely

00:45:48.630 --> 00:45:50.640
abandoned all pretenses.

00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:53.400
Now, it's even not
about terrorists.

00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:54.420
It's about the West.

00:45:54.420 --> 00:45:55.590
We have the West.

00:45:55.590 --> 00:45:57.010
They are plotting against us.

00:45:57.010 --> 00:45:58.000
We need to fight back.

00:45:58.000 --> 00:45:59.400
We need to protect us.

00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:04.890
And unfortunately, this
idea is accepted by many.

00:46:04.890 --> 00:46:09.810
And even the ideas
of complete reshuffle

00:46:09.810 --> 00:46:12.210
of the infrastructure
in the country

00:46:12.210 --> 00:46:14.070
is sort of accepted by many.

00:46:14.070 --> 00:46:18.390
Because the internet is seen as
an invention of the Americans.

00:46:18.390 --> 00:46:20.130
So we need to fight back.

00:46:20.130 --> 00:46:24.590
For example, there was a crazy
story just two years ago,

00:46:24.590 --> 00:46:28.140
how the idea of
data localization

00:46:28.140 --> 00:46:29.990
was sold to Russia.

00:46:29.990 --> 00:46:33.660
Some Russian officials
sat from the stage

00:46:33.660 --> 00:46:36.920
that actually, you can see
in Crimea, some of the people

00:46:36.920 --> 00:46:39.830
are playing Warcraft.

00:46:39.830 --> 00:46:47.010
They were-- now, they are
not capable of playing,

00:46:47.010 --> 00:46:49.590
because they are cut
off by the Americans.

00:46:49.590 --> 00:46:51.390
So we need to do
something about it.

00:46:51.390 --> 00:46:54.270
And on this kind of
pretext, well, unfortunately

00:46:54.270 --> 00:46:55.440
are quite popular.

00:46:55.440 --> 00:46:57.140
And people accept this idea.

00:46:57.140 --> 00:46:59.910
IRINA BOROGRAN: And second
question, of course I

00:46:59.910 --> 00:47:05.100
think that it always started
with something nonpolitical

00:47:05.100 --> 00:47:07.166
like torrents websites
and pornography.

00:47:07.166 --> 00:47:12.615
And this has shifted
very soon to politics,

00:47:12.615 --> 00:47:17.310
because to block pornography
websites is also politics.

00:47:17.310 --> 00:47:18.780
It's a restriction.

00:47:18.780 --> 00:47:20.280
JUSTIN KOSSLYN:
Thank you all again.

00:47:20.280 --> 00:47:21.120
Thank you.

00:47:21.120 --> 00:47:21.420
ANDREI SOLDATOV: Thank you.

00:47:21.420 --> 00:47:22.503
IRINA BOROGRAN: Thank you.

00:47:22.503 --> 00:47:24.770
[APPLAUSE]
