00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:21.440 position:63%
Wentworth Miller:
Could two buildings be more different in

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:23.630
Wentworth Miller:
concept and vision?


00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.460
Wentworth Miller:
Whitman College, Princeton's
first modern, four-year

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.230
Wentworth Miller:
dormitory, is constructed in the
traditional Gothic style.

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.120
Wentworth Miller:
Meg Whitman, the former CEO of
eBay, the online auction

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.310
Wentworth Miller:
giant, gave $30 million to the
University for the $136

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:43.570
Wentworth Miller:
million project.

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.510
Wentworth Miller:
It was designed by Demetri
Porphyrios, who is

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.010
Wentworth Miller:
unapologetic for his traditional
approach to

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.340
Wentworth Miller:
architecture.

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.490
Demetri Porphyrios
I'm interested in doing Gothic

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:56.240
Demetri Porphyrios
buildings which are robust,
meaning that they will have a

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.330
Demetri Porphyrios
longevity of life.


00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:03.100
Demetri Porphyrios
So the external wall has to be
properly constructed in stone,

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.010
Demetri Porphyrios
which is bonded with a brick
support behind it,

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:07.120
Demetri Porphyrios
et cetera, et cetera.


00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.930
Demetri Porphyrios
And it should be a wall
structure which will have to

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:19.780
Demetri Porphyrios
have at least a lifespan of
about 200, 250 years.

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.730
Wentworth Miller:
Far from traditional, the Lewis
Science Library, which

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:26.490
Wentworth Miller:
also houses the Princeton
Institute for Computational

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.850
Wentworth Miller:
Science, is unlike any building


00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.970
Wentworth Miller:
you've never seen before.


00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:36.250 position:56%
Wentworth Miller:
New in its architectural forms,
new in it's methods of construction.

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.980
Wentworth Miller:
The project cost over $74 million.

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.780
Wentworth Miller:
Designed by the famous and
controversial architect, Frank

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.000
Wentworth Miller:
Gehry, the building was
primarily funded by a

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.020
Wentworth Miller:
$60 million gift from Peter Lewis,
the highly creative, former

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.290
Wentworth Miller:
CEO of Progressive Insurance.

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.270
Wentworth Miller:
Peter makes no bones about his
belief that Princeton also

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.170
Wentworth Miller:
needs architecture that
looks to the future.

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.300 position:58%
Peter Lewis:
Frank, in my view, is the first great

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.920
Peter Lewis:
architect of the 21st century,
probably more than the

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.060 position:61%
Peter Lewis:
greatest architect of the 20th century.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.080
Peter Lewis:
Although he might be that as well.

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.560 position:84%
Peter Lewis:
Whether history validates my view, remains to be seen.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.050
Peter Lewis:
No architect, no builder is
addressing the future any more

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:18.500
Peter Lewis:
than Frank is today.


00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.820 position:70%
Craig Webb:
I think we have afew kind of unwritten rules.

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.510
Craig Webb:
But one of them is if it just
looks anything like something

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.690
Craig Webb:
anybody has done, no.


00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.110 position:63%
Craig Webb:
And the second rule is, if it looks like

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.380
Craig Webb:
anything we've done, no.


00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.750
Wentworth Miller:
Two builders, those two very

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.000
Wentworth Miller:
different visions.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.320
[music]

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.760
Wentworth Miller:
Much of the story of Whitman
College is a story of stone.

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.730
Wentworth Miller:
Finding stone, cutting stone,
finding ways to support the

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.250
Wentworth Miller:
weight of stone, and finding
craftsmen who have the skills

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.510
Wentworth Miller:
to construct stone buildings
with techniques no longer in

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:54.760
Wentworth Miller:
general use.

John Zeigler:
The field stone, the bluestone, each piece was

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:03.330
John Zeigler:
handled, people estimate roughly
eight to nine times,

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.990
John Zeigler:
from the time it came out of the
quarry to the time it got

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:08.030
John Zeigler:
put through the original
guillotine, placed in a

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.150
John Zeigler:
pallet, shipped to the site.


00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.100
John Zeigler:
And then picked up, chipped
away, piece by piece, by the

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.290
John Zeigler:
masons, up to 77 stone masons at
one point in time, with 30

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:17.860
John Zeigler:
laborers assisting them.


00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.690
John Zeigler:
The limestone is saw-cut or
hand-chiseled to a particular

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.620
John Zeigler:
location on the building.


00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.720
John Zeigler:
If you looked around the site,
you'll see many of those

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.500 position:61%
John Zeigler:
pieces of limestone sitting on pallets.

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.750
John Zeigler:
They all have numbers on the
bottom of them, because they

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.870 position:69%
John Zeigler:
all have a precise location on the building.

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:36.960
John Zeigler:
The field stone was about 5,000
tons, somewhere around

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:41.610
John Zeigler:
175,000 pieces individually
cut on site.

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:45.680 position:67%
John Zeigler:
The limestone was approximately 2,500 tons,

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.350
John Zeigler:
somewhere around 38,000 to
40,000 pieces of limestone.

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:52.380 position:58%
Wentworth Miller:
Much of Demetri's work was devoted to

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.660
Wentworth Miller:
the site plan and the creation
of courtyards.

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.370
Wentworth Miller:
One of the interesting
refinements, which he borrowed

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.560
Wentworth Miller:
from Ralph Adams Cram's Graduate
College, is that the

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.350
Wentworth Miller:
courtyards are not exactly
square, but just one or two

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:07.600
Wentworth Miller:
degrees off a right angle.


00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:11.220
Wentworth Miller:
Most visitors probably aren't
conscious of this difference.

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.580
Wentworth Miller:
But it makes the experience of
the courtyards mysteriously

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:16.410
Wentworth Miller:
fascinating.

Meg Whitman:
You come up to the building and you just sort

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:21.450
Meg Whitman:
of step back and say, wow.


00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:24.990
[music]

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:27.300
Meg Whitman:
Interestingly, it may sound
simplistic, but I did it

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.740 position:64%
Meg Whitman:
because it gave another 125 kids a year a

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:31.710
Meg Whitman:
chance to go to Princeton.


00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:33.830
Meg Whitman:
Beginning, middle and end of story,

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:35.680
Meg Whitman:
because I am so fond of this place.

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.780
Meg Whitman:
I adored my time here.

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.820
Meg Whitman:
And I want other people to have
that same opportunity.

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:43.550
Demetri Porphyrios:
We've taken up the challenge of how

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:47.320
Demetri Porphyrios:
you can actually work within
contemporary industrial

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:53.330
Demetri Porphyrios:
production and at the same time
give the sense of tactile

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:57.370
Demetri Porphyrios:
personality to a building.


00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:59.820
Demetri Porphyrios:
So the materials that we
use are always what I

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:01.290
Demetri Porphyrios:
call natural materials.


00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:04.950
Demetri Porphyrios:
Materials which are not going
through an industrial

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:07.740
Demetri Porphyrios:
production of manufacture.


00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:11.160
Demetri Porphyrios:
That does not project the
coldness of industrial

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.960
Demetri Porphyrios:
production, but it actually
presents a more kind of humane

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:18.020
Demetri Porphyrios:
face, something that you can
actually touch, a building

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:20.100 position:58%
Demetri Porphyrios:
that you will love to actually touch.

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:23.510
Demetri Porphyrios:
A building that you would love
to kind of lean against, to a

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:26.840
Demetri Porphyrios:
talk with a friend or whatever.

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:28.440
Meg Whitman:
You might have heard a funny story.

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.820
Meg Whitman:
There was a summer executive
program here.

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:33.630
Meg Whitman:
And they were watching the
finishing touches being put on

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:35.210
Meg Whitman:
Whitman College this summer.


00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:37.900
Meg Whitman:
And one of the group said to one
of the faculty members at

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:40.810
Meg Whitman:
Princeton, "Boy, when Princeton
renovates a building, they

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:42.140
Meg Whitman:
really go to it."


00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:46.950

They thought this had been
here for 100 years.

While the plans for Whitman College were

moving forward, the impossible occurred.

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:55.590
Wentworth Miller:
Princeton decided that Frank
Gehry, who had been rejected

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:58.030 position:69%
Wentworth Miller:
in the past, could design a building for the

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:00.330

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:08.710

Harold takes me to the corner,

Gehry building on campus."


00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:12.000
Peter Lewis:
I said, "Harold, there's no way."


00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.570
Peter Lewis:
And he said, "Oh yes, we can."

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:14.830
Peter Lewis:
And he said, "We have a need.


00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:16.930 position:58%
Peter Lewis:
We have to build the science library.

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:19.330

We have a wonderful site for it.

Peter Lewis:
The budget's $60 million.


00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:24.790
Peter Lewis:
Jerry, the provost and I,
got it all figured out.

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:27.590
Peter Lewis:
And we think it would be a great
spot to have a Gehry

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:30.330
Peter Lewis:
building on the campus."

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:34.030
Peter Lewis:
I said something like, "Harold,
I don't think it's possible.

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:36.540

But if you can get it done,
I'll pay for it."

Frank Gehry:
Why would anybody do that?


00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:14.810
Frank Gehry:
It has to do with my belief
that a building can have

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:18.600
Frank Gehry:
feeling, that there can
buildings that are deadly

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:21.990

between sciences, fields like
biophysics, fields like

geochemistry.


00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:51.790

These are fields that if you had
said those names 50 years

ago, no one would have known
what you were talking about.

00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:58.900
Shirley M. Tilghman:
The library is in fact sort
a representation of that.

00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:01.900
Shirley M. Tilghman:
It is a way of our saying the
collective knowledge of the

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:04.640
Shirley M. Tilghman:
natural sciences is now brought
together in a single

The Tree House, which I don't know where that

Craig Webb:
name came from, but that was
originally the map room.

00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:14.380

And I think it still contains
a lot of map cases.

And the way the roof planes
really hang out over the side

a kind of protective

environment.


00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:24.100
Craig Webb:
Because it has these roofs that
are cantilevered off the

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:26.150
Craig Webb:
side of the building, kind of
shade the ground around them.

00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:29.670

And then really connect the
building to the trees, which I

00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:33.930 position:64%
Craig Webb:
guess is where tree house idea came from.

00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:36.540

I love the atrium that comes
through here and the

00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:40.810

exploration of color, which is
related to painting and to

perception of the world around us.

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:44.890
Craig Webb:
In particular on this building, I

00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:46.240
Craig Webb:
was looking at Kandinsky.


00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:49.030
Craig Webb:
His paintings have lots and
lots of different colors.

00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:52.050
Craig Webb:
And the part that's the most
interesting to me is the way

00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:54.240
Craig Webb:
the colors relate to each other.

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:55.940
Craig Webb:
And then the most exciting part
is then you finally paint

00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:57.070
Craig Webb:
the building.


00:08:57.070 --> 00:08:59.450
Craig Webb:
And a lot of really unexpected
things start to happen.

00:08:59.450 --> 00:09:01.040
Craig Webb:
Because now you're dealing
in full scale.

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:03.870
Craig Webb:
There's a lot of daylight that
comes into this building.

00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:07.730
Craig Webb:
And the colors start to bounce,
one off the other.

00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:10.370
Craig Webb:
It produces a whole different
palette of colors that you

00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:11.620
Craig Webb:
weren't quite expecting.


00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:17.650
[music]

00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:20.560
Wentworth Miller:
Two very different buildings, two

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:22.710
Wentworth Miller:
extreme visions.


00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:27.190
Wentworth Miller:
In very different ways, they
embody an ideal of excellence,

00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:30.390 position:67%
Wentworth Miller:
of doing things better than you did before.

00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:33.310
Wentworth Miller:
And in very different ways,
they both encapsulate the

00:09:33.310 --> 00:09:36.400
Wentworth Miller:
deep-rooted ideals of Princeton
University as a

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:36.970
Wentworth Miller:
university.


00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:40.220
Wentworth Miller:
They embody both the venerable
traditions that provide links

00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:43.780
Wentworth Miller:
with its past and the creativity
and innovation with

00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:45.850 position:59%
Wentworth Miller:
which it will lead us into the future.
