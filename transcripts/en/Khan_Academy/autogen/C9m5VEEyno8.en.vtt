00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:02.500
 In this video I want 

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.120
 to find different ways of expressing the person 

00:00:05.126 --> 00:00:07.402
 of this whole large rectangle, 

00:00:07.402 --> 00:00:11.535
 which we see is composed of these six smaller rectangles. 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:13.760
 There are several ways we can do it. 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:15.580
 One is simply to multiply the height 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:18.940
 of this large rectangle along its width. 

00:00:18.942 --> 00:00:20.242
 And what is his height? 

00:00:20.242 --> 00:00:22.842
 It is from here to here, 

00:00:22.842 --> 00:00:25.420
 this distance is u ^ 2, 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:27.091
 and then from there to there, 

00:00:27.091 --> 00:00:30.481
 this distance is -6u. 

00:00:30.481 --> 00:00:31.387
 And I know what you think. 

00:00:31.387 --> 00:00:34.080
 How can the distance be -6? 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.379
 Is not the distance always positive? 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:39.342
 Well even-may be positive, 

00:00:39.342 --> 00:00:41.802
 if u is negative, 

00:00:41.802 --> 00:00:43.820
 so it's perfectly reasonable to say, 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.597
 that this distance can be -6u. 

00:00:45.597 --> 00:00:49.621
 So, the whole height is here 

00:00:49.621 --> 00:00:53.986
 y2-6u. 

00:00:53.986 --> 00:00:57.540
 Or you can write it as u ^ 2 plus this distance, 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:58.753
 which is -6u, 

00:00:58.753 --> 00:01:00.976
 y2 plus + 6y, 

00:01:00.976 --> 00:01:03.959
 which is the same as y2-6u. 

00:01:03.959 --> 00:01:06.705
 Therefore this is the height of this large rectangle. 

00:01:06.705 --> 00:01:08.726
 What is his breadth? 

00:01:08.726 --> 00:01:10.626
 Well, the width is 

00:01:10.626 --> 00:01:11.813
 the width 

00:01:11.813 --> 00:01:14.200
 of this purple rectangle, 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.410
 it is 3u ^ 2, 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.498
 plus the width of this yellow rectangle, 

00:01:19.498 --> 00:01:20.418
 which is -2u, 

00:01:20.418 --> 00:01:22.795
 which may be minus, 

00:01:22.795 --> 00:01:24.769
 the logic of why it may be negative is the same 

00:01:24.769 --> 00:01:26.812
 as here, why can it be negative. 

00:01:26.812 --> 00:01:28.427
 And then plus 

00:01:28.427 --> 00:01:31.847
 the width of the blue rectangle. 

00:01:31.847 --> 00:01:33.454
 And if you bring them all together, 

00:01:33.454 --> 00:01:36.476
 the width of the entire rectangle will be 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:44.540
 3u ^ 2-2u + 1. 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.594
 So the expression I just wrote, 

00:01:47.594 --> 00:01:54.884
 will give us the face of the whole big rectangle. 

00:01:54.884 --> 00:01:56.138
 There is another way to find it. 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.360
 One big hint is that this big rectangle 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.595
 is divided into these six smaller rectangles 

00:02:01.595 --> 00:02:04.311
 and we have the dimensions of the six smaller rectangles. 

00:02:04.311 --> 00:02:06.006
 So we can find the faces of each of them 

00:02:06.006 --> 00:02:08.167
 and then gather them all together. 

00:02:08.167 --> 00:02:09.629
 Let's take a look at this one. 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:10.837
 Height of breadth. 

00:02:10.837 --> 00:02:12.709
 The face of this purple rectangle is 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:14.477
 the height y2 

00:02:14.477 --> 00:02:18.605
 in the width which is 3th in square. 

00:02:18.605 --> 00:02:21.447
 This is equal to ... it will be three ... 

00:02:21.447 --> 00:02:25.859
 and then u ^ 2 by u ^ 2 is u ^ 4. 

00:02:25.859 --> 00:02:27.275
 What is the face of this yellow rectangle? 

00:02:27.275 --> 00:02:28.877
 The height is u ^ 2. 

00:02:28.877 --> 00:02:31.223
 This is u ^ 2 in the width, 

00:02:31.223 --> 00:02:33.359
 on -2y, 

00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:37.886
 which will give us -2u ^ 3. 

00:02:37.886 --> 00:02:39.117
 What about blue? 

00:02:39.117 --> 00:02:42.949
 The height of the width is u ^ 2 at one, 

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:46.338
 which simply equals y ^ 2. 

00:02:46.338 --> 00:02:47.406
 On this green rectangle 

00:02:47.406 --> 00:02:50.817
 the face is the height that is now -6u, 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:56.380
 on a width that is 3 ^ y2, 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:01.012
 which will be equal to: -6 at 3 is -18, 

00:03:01.012 --> 00:03:05.656
 and then u by u ^ 2 is u ^ 3. 

00:03:05.656 --> 00:03:08.086
 The face of the gray rectangle is 

00:03:08.086 --> 00:03:11.107
 the height that is -6u, 

00:03:11.107 --> 00:03:15.818
 on the width that is -2u, 

00:03:15.818 --> 00:03:17.598
 what gives us ... 

00:03:17.598 --> 00:03:20.225
 -6 by -2 is plus 12. 

00:03:20.225 --> 00:03:23.755
 u is u ^ y ^. 

00:03:23.755 --> 00:03:26.591
 Finally, the face of this rectangle here, 

00:03:26.591 --> 00:03:30.259
 is the height that is -6u, 

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:32.907
 in width, which is just one, 

00:03:32.907 --> 00:03:35.995
 which is equal to -6u. 

00:03:35.995 --> 00:03:38.410
 And to get the face of this entire rectangle, 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.034
 we can just assemble the faces of the smaller ones, 

00:03:41.034 --> 00:03:44.401
 so it will be equal to: 

00:03:44.401 --> 00:03:47.976
 3rd on the fourth, 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:56.520
 3u ^ 4 plus -2u ^ 3 ... 

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.300
 Let me write it in a color that matches it. 

00:03:59.307 --> 00:04:03.278
 -2u ^ 3 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:10.260
 plus y ^ 2 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.259
 -18u ^ 3 ... 

00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:18.765
 and so, -18u-3, 

00:04:18.765 --> 00:04:21.783
 plus 12u ^ 2 ... 

00:04:21.783 --> 00:04:23.362
 Let me write it in black. 

00:04:23.362 --> 00:04:26.404
 Plus 12u ^ 2, 

00:04:26.404 --> 00:04:29.538
 and then finally, but not least, 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:32.220
 we have -6u. 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.134
 This is the expression of the face of all this, 

00:04:35.134 --> 00:04:36.946
 but we can still simplify it. 

00:04:36.946 --> 00:04:40.800
 We have only one member of the fourth degree, 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.843
 so I'll just copy it. 

00:04:42.843 --> 00:04:47.719
 We have a fourth degree member, 

00:04:47.719 --> 00:04:48.740
 so I just rewrite it. 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.877
 3u ^ 4. 

00:04:50.877 --> 00:04:53.500
 How many third grade members do we have? 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:57.309
 We have -2u ^ 3. 

00:04:57.309 --> 00:05:00.676
 We have -18u ^ 3. 

00:05:00.676 --> 00:05:01.953
 If I gather them together, 

00:05:01.953 --> 00:05:03.671
 how much of a third degree will we have? 

00:05:03.671 --> 00:05:06.782
 Well -2 plus -18 is -20, 

00:05:06.782 --> 00:05:10.438
 minus 20u ^ 3. 

00:05:10.438 --> 00:05:13.913
 And then how many second grade members do we have? 

00:05:13.913 --> 00:05:16.117
 We have one u ^ 2 here 

00:05:16.117 --> 00:05:18.253
 and then we have another 12u ^ 2. 

00:05:18.253 --> 00:05:22.804
 We collect them together and get 13u ^ 2. 

00:05:22.804 --> 00:05:27.703
 And finally, we have to pull out six. 

00:05:27.703 --> 00:05:28.841
 And we got it, 

00:05:28.841 --> 00:05:32.835
 another expression for the face of the entire rectangle. 

00:05:32.835 --> 00:05:34.716
 The whole reason I do this is to realize, 

00:05:34.716 --> 00:05:38.083
 that this up here and here below are equivalent, 

00:05:38.083 --> 00:05:41.147
 and that the way we multiply it is actually in line 

00:05:41.147 --> 00:05:42.912
 exactly the way we found the faces 

00:05:42.912 --> 00:05:45.234
 of the smaller rectangles here. 

00:05:45.234 --> 00:05:48.601
 You can say that u ^ 2 by 3u ^ 2 is 3u ^ 4. 

00:05:48.601 --> 00:05:52.080
 y2 in -2y is -2u ^ 3. 

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:56.680
 u ^ 2 one is u ^ 2. 

00:05:56.681 --> 00:05:58.026
 This is exactly the same thing we did, 

00:05:58.026 --> 00:05:58.840
 when we found the faces of these rectangles. 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:00.984
 I suppose we can say, 

00:06:00.984 --> 00:06:02.114
 in this top row. 

00:06:02.114 --> 00:06:03.716
 And then we'll take -6th 

00:06:03.716 --> 00:06:07.153
 and we can say that -6u by 3u ^ 2 

00:06:07.153 --> 00:06:09.149
 is -18. 

00:06:09.149 --> 00:06:13.190
 -6 on -2u is plus 12u ^ 2. 

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:19.903
 -6u at one is -6u. 

00:06:19.903 --> 00:06:21.726
 I describe it to realize that we are not doing here 

00:06:21.726 --> 00:06:22.707
 some kind of magic. 

00:06:22.707 --> 00:06:24.821
 This makes sense when you look at it 

00:06:24.821 --> 00:06:27.753
 thus with respect to the formula for a person.
