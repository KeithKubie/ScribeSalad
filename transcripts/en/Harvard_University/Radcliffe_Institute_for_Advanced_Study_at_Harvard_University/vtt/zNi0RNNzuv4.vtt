00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:02.230
- Welcome back.

00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:06.000
It's my privilege to introduce
Professor Gabriela Soto

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.100
Laveaga, who is going to
introduce our keynote speaker.

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:15.090
Professor Soto Laveaga
also served on the planning

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:19.440
committee and was
responsible for just so much

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.360
of the structure that
you see up here today,

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:26.640
along with Professor Deloria
and Professor Jeeyoung Kim.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.840
She just really had an immense
imprint on this conference.

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.000
So I introduced her also
with a sense of gratitude,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.250
and also for having
gotten to know

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.320
a colleague better in my time
at Harvard and Radcliffe.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.930
Gabriela Soto Laveaga
is a professor

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.420
of the history of
science in the Harvard

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.723
faculty of Arts and Sciences.

00:00:47.723 --> 00:00:49.140
And her current
research interests

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.510
investigate knowledge,
production, and circulation

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.300
between Mexico and India.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.970
Also, medical professionals
and social movements

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.330
in science and development
projects in the 20th century.

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:03.660
Her first book, Jungle
Laboratories, Mexican Peasants,

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.480
National Projects and
the Making of the Pill,

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.120
in 2009, won the
Robert K. Merten Award

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.330
from the American Sociological
Association's section

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.880
on science, knowledge,
and technology.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.400
Her second monograph, Almost
Done, Sanitizing Rebellion,

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.670
Physician Strikes, Public Health
and Repression in 20th Century

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.030
Mexico, examines the role
of health care providers

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.300
both as critical actors in the
formation of modern states,

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.940
and as social agitators.

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.270
She is not only almost
done with a second book,

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.460
she's almost done with a third.

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.480
I'm not going to
set up expectations,

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:45.000
but this is a remarkably
productive scholar, who

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.740
is really helping us
rethink what science is,

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.190
and its geographic
and cultural roots.

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:57.140
Without further interruption,
Gabriela Soto Laveaga.

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:04.450
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.580
- Thank you so much for that
really beautiful introduction.

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:15.100
In September 2017, when Category
Five Hurricane Maria pummeled

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:19.270
Puerto Rico, the world was
introduced to Carmen Yulín Cruz

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:23.860
Soto, who, often standing in
water sporting a baseball cap,

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.530
and with white-framed
glasses splattered with rain,

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.580
she demanded that help be
brought to Puerto Rico.

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.030
As hours, then days,
then weeks passed,

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.270
she became the firm,
unwavering voice

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:41.180
against the lasting
inequity of colonialism.

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.470
Yulín, as she is called,
unapologetically called out

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.020
and detailed the
Administration's failure

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:49.400
to help.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.290
Television cameras
captured not just

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.700
the vast destruction of the
island, but the Mayor's anger.

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.820
In her words, "We
are dying here.

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:01.880
I cannot fathom that the
greatest nation in the world

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.890
cannot figure out logistics
for a small island," end quote.

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.550
As the death toll surged and
help was not forthcoming,

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:14.060
she positioned herself
behind a mic and declared,

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.260
"I am done being polite, I am
done being politically correct.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.980
I am mad as hell," end quote.

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.770
If colonialism is an
experiment in power,

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:26.780
then Puerto Rico
is an experiment

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.940
that, as most
colonial laboratories,

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.010
has gone on too long.

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.000
Since 1898, when Puerto Rico
passed from the Spanish empire

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.490
to become part of a
growing US empire,

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:39.740
it has been an oxymoron.

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:43.430
An essential afterthought
of the United States.

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.160
A strategic foothold
in the Caribbean.

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.130
While Puerto Ricans
hold American passports,

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:52.850
they do not hold full
citizenship rights.

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:55.190
For many Puerto
Ricans Hurricane Maria

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:56.930
was a moment of reckoning.

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.230
What does it mean to be an
incorporated territory that

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:03.110
belongs to the United States?

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:06.710
The hurricane however, did not
make Yulín in the same way that

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:10.850
the storm did not define or
defy the people of Puerto Rico.

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:14.690
While the outside world may have
become aware of her in 2017,

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:16.760
she rose to fame
and political power

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.730
much earlier, when
she defied the odds,

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:24.040
and a powerful incumbent, to
become the mayor of San Juan.

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.760
Named one of Time Magazine's
100 most influential people,

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.580
she is a woman who has
defied expectations

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.320
since she was a small girl.

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.470
Yulín grew up in Puerto
Rico, but obtained her degree

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:38.380
in political science
from Boston University,

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:41.620
and a Master of Science in
Public Management and Policy

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.610
at the Heinz College at
Carnegie Mellon University.

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:51.160
In 1992, she returned to Puerto
Rico to serve as an advisor

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.960
to San Juan's mayor.

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.590
A decade later, she started
her first and only term

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:59.560
in the House of
Representatives of Puerto Rico.

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.750
As her first term
was concluding,

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:05.020
she again defied
convention and advice

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:08.650
and decided to run
for mayor of San Juan.

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:13.120
San Juan, a city with a metro
area of 2.3 million residents

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:16.090
had been governed by a
powerfully connected politician

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:18.010
for more than 12 years.

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:21.850
Yulín was told repeatedly that
she had neither the funds nor

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:24.540
the connections to win.

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:27.690
Wearing a bandanna that
detractors said made her look

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:32.520
like a revolutionary, and
supporters responded that yes,

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:35.190
it made her look
like a revolutionary,

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:37.290
Yulín took to the streets--

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:40.120
an unprecedented campaign
style declaring that

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.000
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]--

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.250
"power is in the streets."

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:47.400
Public housing, small
villages, immigrants and women

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.830
became the focus
of her campaign.

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:52.050
While on the road, she
explained that she was running

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:55.620
because she wanted quote,
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]..

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:57.960
"a San Juan for everyone."

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:01.170
And indeed, it was the people
of San Juan who propelled her

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:04.350
to a stunning victory in 2012.

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:06.450
As with the people
of Puerto Rico,

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:10.500
Mayor Yulín is not allowing
the hurricane to define her.

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:14.670
The hurricane's aftermath
provided an unexpected platform

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:17.490
for her to speak out
against larger themes,

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:20.970
such as the continued US
presence in the daily life

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:22.350
of Puerto Ricans.

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:25.470
But it is the mayor's voice
and her unwavering commitment

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:27.990
to justice and the
rights of citizens

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:30.360
that have made her an
icon for postcolonial

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:32.820
struggles the world over.

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:35.520
I must confess that it
was difficult to write

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:40.200
an introduction for Yulín
because she does not stop.

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:42.540
In the past 10
days, for example,

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:46.140
it was announced that she would
co-chair Bernie Sanders 2020

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:48.083
campaign for President.

00:06:48.083 --> 00:06:49.998
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:49.998 --> 00:06:50.498
Yes.

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:56.710
A few days later, she
declared that she was running

00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:58.330
for governor of Puerto Rico.

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:01.198
[APPLAUSE]

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:08.060
All while still holding the
position of Mayor of San Juan--

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:11.000
a city still very
much in recovery.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.030
In closing, I want to leave you
with two additional facts about

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:17.790
Yulín that I think exemplify
who she is as a person.

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:19.250
Two images, really.

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:22.620
One is a trailer and the
other one is a t-shirt.

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:25.380
She works from inside
a double wide trailer,

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:27.690
and not the Mayor's
official office,

00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:31.470
because, as she explained,
it is easier for the people

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:34.400
to get to me from here.

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:35.990
And the t-shirt.

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:38.690
A t-shirt that she wore when
she declared last week--

00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:39.650
last Friday--

00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:41.450
that she was running
for Governor.

00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:44.990
The t-shirt declared simply,
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] "without

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:46.190
fear".

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:49.220
Two words that easily
encapsulate Yulín's life,

00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:51.500
and that of the people
she proudly represents--

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:53.090
the people of Puerto Rico.

00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:55.260
Please join me in
welcoming Yulín Cruz.

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:58.725
[APPLAUSE]

00:08:01.695 --> 00:08:02.685
- Thank you so much.

00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:08.390
Can you guys see me?

00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:09.230
Can you see me?

00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:10.840
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:15.320
This seems like I should
be standing on something.

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:18.540
First of all, thank
you all so very much.

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:22.520
I'd like to thank Dean
Brown and everyone

00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:27.553
at Radcliffe Institute for the
honor of speaking before you.

00:08:27.553 --> 00:08:29.720
You see, I'm the great
granddaughter of a sugar cane

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:31.570
plantation worker.

00:08:31.570 --> 00:08:33.500
Man that didn't know
how to read or write,

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:37.429
and had the sense to tell
one of his daughters--

00:08:37.429 --> 00:08:40.320
my grandmother Yulín--

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:43.797
that she was not going to
work the fields, that she

00:08:43.797 --> 00:08:44.880
was going to go to school.

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:47.520
And she thus became
the first one

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:50.860
in her house to learn
to read or write.

00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:54.060
And as the years passed,
became the founding director

00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:57.340
of the School of Physical
Therapy in Puerto Rico.

00:08:57.340 --> 00:09:01.890
So to be standing here
in this great institution

00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:04.830
reminds me of her,
and of the struggle

00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:10.170
that she bore all her life
to make sure that everyone

00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:13.560
had access to good education.

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:16.170
The kind that uplifts
the spirit and the mind,

00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:19.860
and the kind that allows
men, women, children, older,

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:24.480
immigrants, or people that
are just trying to do better

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:27.150
for themselves do exactly that.

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:32.320
Do more than survive and thrive.

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:37.170
But I'm going to disappoint
you right off the bat.

00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:39.450
A lot of speakers
have spoken today,

00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:42.990
and they are experts
in the matter at hand.

00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:45.750
A lot of the colleagues, I
watched you over the internet

00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:47.850
this morning.

00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:49.870
I'm not an expert.

00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:51.450
I'm not an expert
in anything that

00:09:51.450 --> 00:09:57.550
has to do with immigration in
the legal sense of the word.

00:09:57.550 --> 00:10:02.710
What I am, without a doubt,
is witness to the implications

00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:04.930
on everyday life--

00:10:04.930 --> 00:10:07.000
of what happens and
what result when

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:12.450
you bestow upon a group of
people the label of citizen.

00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:19.260
Or you take away from a group
of people the label of citizen.

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.780
What I am is without
a doubt a person

00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:27.990
born in the duality of a
nationality and a citizenship.

00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:31.260
The discussion and
interpretation of this duality

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:37.590
has been cause for many
fights in Puerto Rico.

00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:41.870
Some of them are nice
fights and some of them

00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:44.540
break the dinner table.

00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:48.840
You see, I am a
Puerto Rican national.

00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:54.060
I am an American citizen.

00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:58.500
But I identify myself
as Puerto Rican.

00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:01.900
That means my nation
is Puerto Rico.

00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:06.240
Now, I know that by
mere legal standards,

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:10.140
Puerto Rico may not be
considered a nation because we

00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:12.840
are not a sovereign nation.

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:18.570
But that does not mean that we
don't live in a certain way,

00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:23.190
love in a certain way,
follow certain standards

00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:26.580
and rules of conduct which
are endemic and intrinsic

00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:28.950
to our culture and our language.

00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:32.860
I'm going to tell you
one very little example.

00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:35.250
In English you say I love you.

00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:38.820
You can say I love you to your
daughter, to your husband,

00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:42.790
to your parents, to your dog.

00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:46.180
In Spanish we say,
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]..

00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:54.820
So it doesn't mean that
one language is richer

00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:58.300
than the other, it just
means that one sense

00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:00.850
of expression of the
people that share

00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:05.890
that language is
different than another.

00:12:05.890 --> 00:12:08.560
I also want to ask
you that while I

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:10.390
speak you think
about what I'm saying

00:12:10.390 --> 00:12:14.380
not that from the
perspective of a colonizer,

00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:17.360
but from the perspective of
the person that is living.

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:22.640
This perspective
allows us to partake

00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:26.360
in a common language, a common
cultural bond and shared

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:30.350
values which provide
and surround us all.

00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:34.490
In many ways it creates a
thread capable of forging,

00:12:34.490 --> 00:12:38.090
if you will, something more
binding than economic and

00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:40.450
financial structure creates.

00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:42.060
Is that my friend?

00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:44.150
Yes.

00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:49.700
I told her if the baby makes
any noise don't leave the room.

00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:52.580
Because why is it that every
time a baby makes a noise

00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:54.930
women have to leave the room?

00:12:54.930 --> 00:12:55.715
Right?

00:12:55.715 --> 00:12:56.215
No.

00:12:56.215 --> 00:12:58.770
[APPLAUSE]

00:13:00.570 --> 00:13:03.720
You see, people may
leave behind geography.

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:06.490
They may come from one
country to another,

00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:08.830
from one part of the
country to another,

00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:11.310
from a rural area
to an urban area,

00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:14.310
or from an urban
area to a rural area.

00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:20.870
But when it happens cross
nations, they may leave away,

00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:22.487
but they don't leave.

00:13:22.487 --> 00:13:25.070
You know that saying, you can't
take the hood out of the girl,

00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:26.820
but you can take the
girl out of the hood,

00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:29.290
or it goes the other way around?

00:13:29.290 --> 00:13:36.160
But the culture, that who we
are follows us wherever we are.

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:37.850
And there's a
certain duality that

00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:40.700
happens within people
when they realize

00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:47.500
that they want to be one thing,
but they are something else.

00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:50.500
The duality when
society expects us

00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:53.380
to be different
than what we are,

00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:55.510
and to submerge
ourselves in what

00:13:55.510 --> 00:13:58.870
often is called the melting pot.

00:13:58.870 --> 00:14:02.890
It's what Shakespeare would
say, "To be, or not to be".

00:14:05.710 --> 00:14:12.200
I am the embodiment of the
Puerto Rican conundrum.

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:14.600
You see, some Puerto
Ricans feel themselves

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:18.830
as second-class citizens,
for they identify themselves

00:14:18.830 --> 00:14:21.140
as Americans first.

00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:24.470
And to them-- and they have
every right to feel that way--

00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:27.140
no one needs condemn
them for that.

00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:33.070
To them, equality will only
come through statehood.

00:14:33.070 --> 00:14:36.270
And I'll talk a little bit
about that in a few minutes.

00:14:36.270 --> 00:14:39.510
Other Puerto Ricans-- and
there's at least one here

00:14:39.510 --> 00:14:40.770
in the crowd--

00:14:40.770 --> 00:14:44.570
other Puerto Ricans
feel as I feel.

00:14:44.570 --> 00:14:47.460
We respect our
American citizenship,

00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:52.880
but we identify ourselves
as Puerto Rican nationals.

00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:57.140
We are a territory
of the United States,

00:14:57.140 --> 00:15:02.270
which means we are a colony
of the United States.

00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:10.610
We have even been told that we
can be sold and disposed of.

00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:14.080
And though that language has
come from the White House,

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:21.210
and it has come from
Congress, sold and disposed of

00:15:21.210 --> 00:15:26.505
as if we were a mere possession
and not human beings.

00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:32.240
Do not get me wrong.

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:34.690
You know, I admire
the foundation

00:15:34.690 --> 00:15:39.940
of the way this country was put
together so much that I want it

00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:41.860
for my own.

00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:45.820
"We hold these truths
to be self-evident

00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:48.820
that all men are
created equal, that they

00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:52.060
are endowed by their creator
with certain unalienable

00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:53.740
rights.

00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:57.350
That among these
are life, liberty,

00:15:57.350 --> 00:15:59.690
and the pursuit of happiness."

00:15:59.690 --> 00:16:02.200
Now of course, the
definition expanded.

00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:06.490
Men became women, men
that were white men

00:16:06.490 --> 00:16:09.670
and were expected to
be property owners,

00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:14.150
became, really, all
men and all women.

00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:18.170
But somehow, having a
citizenship does not really

00:16:18.170 --> 00:16:22.510
give you the right to fully
participate in democracy,

00:16:22.510 --> 00:16:25.280
for when you take
people's rights away,

00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:29.060
when you don't allow them access
to appropriate health care

00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:31.670
or appropriate education,
when it takes you

00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:35.300
longer in this country
to get to college,

00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:39.940
and a lot of paperwork,
where we can go into a store,

00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:43.610
and in 15 minutes with
no background checks,

00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:46.250
buy an assault rifle,
you know there's

00:16:46.250 --> 00:16:49.620
something terribly wrong.

00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:52.810
And those things are a
hindrance to participating

00:16:52.810 --> 00:16:56.620
in the greatest
tapestry of democracy.

00:16:56.620 --> 00:16:59.560
So you see, some fellow
countryman of mine

00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:01.480
think that if they
become a state,

00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:04.420
equality we'll be
waiting for them.

00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:09.020
Now I ask my
brothers and sisters

00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:11.930
of the great native nations
of the United States,

00:17:11.930 --> 00:17:14.150
has that been the case?

00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:18.200
I ask my Muslims
brothers and sisters,

00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:20.460
have that been the case?

00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:22.770
I asked the transgender
community has that

00:17:22.770 --> 00:17:23.400
been the case?

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:26.790
And the LGBTQ community,
has that been the case?

00:17:26.790 --> 00:17:30.170
I asked women if that
has been the case,

00:17:30.170 --> 00:17:35.290
and I can ask the same
thing of African-Americans.

00:17:35.290 --> 00:17:42.240
Citizenship, the legality of
it does not give you equality.

00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:45.780
Equality has to be fought,
has to be nurtured,

00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:48.930
has to be taken care of
every day of your lives

00:17:48.930 --> 00:17:52.430
with everything you do.

00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:55.550
Equality has to do with
the way we tell history.

00:17:55.550 --> 00:18:00.530
If you ask historians, Puerto
Rico was discovered in 1493.

00:18:00.530 --> 00:18:03.190
The truth is we
weren't discovered.

00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:06.830
That Taíno natives were there,
and they called the island

00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:10.840
nation of Puerto Rico,
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]..

00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:13.350
And you see, what I said
there, the island nation

00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:16.770
of Puerto Rico is
enough to make people

00:18:16.770 --> 00:18:19.380
all over Puerto Rico
tell me that I'm

00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:21.120
a communist and a socialist.

00:18:23.898 --> 00:18:25.290
Yeah.

00:18:25.290 --> 00:18:29.800
Takes a little longer
getting off the airport now,

00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:32.110
it takes a little
more inspection

00:18:32.110 --> 00:18:37.120
of my stuff at the airport
now, but that is the price

00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:42.040
that we must pay to ensure that
others have the same rights

00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:42.660
that we have.

00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:48.540
Now, I ask you, when they
wrote that were they thinking

00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:55.270
only white men that are property
owners will forever, ever have

00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:56.650
those on unalienable rights?

00:18:56.650 --> 00:19:00.000
Or aren't people
in France endowed

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.310
with the same
unalienable rights?

00:19:03.310 --> 00:19:05.130
What about the creator?

00:19:05.130 --> 00:19:07.920
So if you're a Muslim
or you're Hindu,

00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:12.750
your creator does not endow you
with those unalienable rights?

00:19:12.750 --> 00:19:14.520
I'm Catholic.

00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:17.940
I walk around-- because my
mother will chastise me if I

00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:19.180
don't do this--

00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:23.370
with a rosary,
especially around Lent.

00:19:23.370 --> 00:19:25.230
But that doesn't
give me the right

00:19:25.230 --> 00:19:32.010
to feel that people that pray
the way they want to pray

00:19:32.010 --> 00:19:39.190
need to feel less safe
than I do when I pray.

00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:40.960
So we have to think
about something

00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:44.170
that is terribly wrong, and
I don't have it with me.

00:19:44.170 --> 00:19:46.190
Can I borrow your
phone for a second?

00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:55.980
This little thing, as good
as it is, it connects us all.

00:19:55.980 --> 00:19:58.900
It connects us to
a larger humanity,

00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:03.650
and it connects us to
a different morality.

00:20:03.650 --> 00:20:06.440
It makes us think that
citizenship is not only

00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:10.970
an issue of legality, but
it's an issue of morality.

00:20:10.970 --> 00:20:15.850
Because when New Zealand Muslims
were killed a couple of days

00:20:15.850 --> 00:20:19.450
ago, we were able to
see their Prime Minister

00:20:19.450 --> 00:20:24.350
embody what every public
servant should be.

00:20:24.350 --> 00:20:26.720
And when a few weeks
ago, or perhaps--

00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:29.150
thank you-- for
perhaps months ago,

00:20:29.150 --> 00:20:32.450
the Jewish community
in Pittsburgh

00:20:32.450 --> 00:20:37.120
also suffered the
tragedy of hatred.

00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:41.010
We were all there to see it.

00:20:41.010 --> 00:20:44.770
September 20 changed my life.

00:20:44.770 --> 00:20:48.610
It changed all of our lives.

00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:54.670
Since 1952 Puerto Ricans
have had a self-government,

00:20:54.670 --> 00:21:00.420
except any laws that we pass
cannot be in contravention

00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:03.810
to any law that the
United States has passed.

00:21:03.810 --> 00:21:09.150
We became citizens of the
United States in 1917 by birth.

00:21:09.150 --> 00:21:12.180
Before that, for a very
brief period of time,

00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:15.930
the Puerto Rican
citizenship was acknowledged

00:21:15.930 --> 00:21:17.220
by the United States.

00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:22.800
And once 1917 came around,
our citizenship was wiped out.

00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:28.200
We are citizens of
the United States.

00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:31.230
We cannot vote for the
President of the United States,

00:21:31.230 --> 00:21:35.370
although we vote for the
primaries of Republicans

00:21:35.370 --> 00:21:37.140
and Democrats.

00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:40.560
And you say, well
that's just not fair.

00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:42.580
Is it?

00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:45.470
It depends the way
you think about it.

00:21:45.470 --> 00:21:50.780
You see, if you think about
it in one type of light,

00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:52.820
you will think it's not fair.

00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:55.220
This is an issue
of civil rights.

00:21:55.220 --> 00:21:57.360
And if you are an
American citizen,

00:21:57.360 --> 00:22:03.000
you should partake of the
entire tapestry of democracy.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:07.260
If you think that Puerto
Rico is a nation as it is,

00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:09.360
you will say you know what?

00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:12.400
This is not an issue
of civil rights.

00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:15.790
This is a
self-determination issue.

00:22:15.790 --> 00:22:17.940
So let's rewrite
story and tell it

00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:22.080
like it is-- something that
is not difficult for me.

00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:24.720
Puerto Rico was not
discovered in 1493,

00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:30.320
Puerto Rico was first
invaded in 1493.

00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:39.660
Puerto Rico was invaded a
second time on July 25, 1898.

00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:46.710
And we were seated, given to the
United States as an act of war.

00:22:46.710 --> 00:22:50.700
At the time, Cuba
was already fighting

00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:51.990
for their independence.

00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:57.145
In Puerto Rico, there was more
of a polite and autonomous way

00:22:57.145 --> 00:22:58.020
of looking at things.

00:22:58.020 --> 00:23:05.020
We had obtained what is called--
somebody translate it for me--

00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:07.920
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:10.260
Autonomous letter?

00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:10.890
For Spain.

00:23:10.890 --> 00:23:16.020
It gave us the rights that
Spanish citizens had--

00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:20.400
an unlimited interaction
with the Spanish government.

00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:22.320
But eight months
later, boom, there

00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:24.450
comes the Spanish
American War and we

00:23:24.450 --> 00:23:27.390
are given to the United States.

00:23:27.390 --> 00:23:32.790
In 1952, Puerto Ricans voted
for their Constitution.

00:23:32.790 --> 00:23:35.880
The Constitution had to be
ratified by the United States,

00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:40.910
and Congress took and wiped
out an entire section of it.

00:23:40.910 --> 00:23:47.960
A section that talked mainly
about privacy, and dignity,

00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:53.400
and the right to all
to be treated the same.

00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:58.170
Now again, this is not
about being anti-American.

00:23:58.170 --> 00:24:01.950
This is about understanding that
Puerto Rico is a nation that

00:24:01.950 --> 00:24:06.280
should be given the
right to freely determine

00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:10.660
what kind of relationship it
wants with the United States.

00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:14.050
And if the majority of
the people want statehood,

00:24:14.050 --> 00:24:14.890
let it be so.

00:24:14.890 --> 00:24:16.330
If the majority
of the people want

00:24:16.330 --> 00:24:20.170
free association, which is what
I believe in, let it be so.

00:24:20.170 --> 00:24:24.010
If the majority of the people
want independent, let it be so.

00:24:24.010 --> 00:24:26.110
If the majority
of the people want

00:24:26.110 --> 00:24:29.710
to enhance the current
status and take it out

00:24:29.710 --> 00:24:33.100
of the territorial
clause so that we are not

00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:35.620
under the total
powers of Congress,

00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:40.550
let it be so, but let us decide.

00:24:40.550 --> 00:24:45.750
So I understand the NAACP, when
a few weeks ago and months ago

00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:48.600
they said we are going to
support statehood for Puerto

00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:51.900
Rico, because if you look at it
from the strictest standpoint

00:24:51.900 --> 00:24:56.330
of civil rights, then you say
that's the way it should go.

00:24:56.330 --> 00:24:59.750
All I'm asking is let us decide.

00:24:59.750 --> 00:25:05.360
Let American democracy truly
exemplify itself in this year,

00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:07.070
in this century.

00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:11.030
Respect the people you invaded
enough to let them decide what

00:25:11.030 --> 00:25:13.370
they want for their future.

00:25:13.370 --> 00:25:15.410
Because one thing
that's been proven

00:25:15.410 --> 00:25:22.910
beyond any shadow of a doubt,
what we have is not working.

00:25:22.910 --> 00:25:24.020
It's not working for us.

00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:28.945
I told you that on September
20 my life changed.

00:25:33.090 --> 00:25:37.790
The Puerto Rico that I knew
will never be the same.

00:25:37.790 --> 00:25:42.403
The San Juan that I grew up
in will never be the same.

00:25:42.403 --> 00:25:43.070
And I just met--

00:25:47.290 --> 00:25:48.580
I didn't get your name.

00:25:48.580 --> 00:25:49.640
- Jean-Luc.

00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:50.290
- Jean-Luc.

00:25:50.290 --> 00:25:51.400
Jean-Luc Picard.

00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:53.400
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:59.900
Jean-Luc was telling me that
his family is from Katrina.

00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:01.820
And why do I say it
like that rather than

00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:04.100
saying from New Orleans?

00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:09.700
Because we start
identifying ourselves

00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:15.220
by the pain and the sorrow
that we have tried to overcome.

00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:16.980
Holyoke, Massachusetts.

00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:18.910
60% of the Puerto Rican--

00:26:18.910 --> 00:26:21.670
of the population of Holyoke,
Massachusetts is Puerto Rican.

00:26:24.670 --> 00:26:26.570
And about a year
ago I went to visit,

00:26:26.570 --> 00:26:31.710
and the children would come
and tell me I am from Maria.

00:26:31.710 --> 00:26:35.040
So you see, migration comes
because of different things.

00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:37.410
It comes because people want
to live their life the way

00:26:37.410 --> 00:26:39.540
they want to live,
because people want

00:26:39.540 --> 00:26:42.450
to run from dictatorial
governments,

00:26:42.450 --> 00:26:45.240
because people want to
love whomever they want to

00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:48.000
and they can not do it
because, and this country

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.800
knows this better
than any other,

00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:54.090
because they are looking
for religious freedom.

00:26:54.090 --> 00:26:59.250
And climate change
creates migration.

00:26:59.250 --> 00:27:02.210
The most devastating kind.

00:27:02.210 --> 00:27:05.090
3.2 million Puerto Ricans
live in Puerto Rico,

00:27:05.090 --> 00:27:08.200
and five million Puerto Ricans
live in the United States.

00:27:11.860 --> 00:27:20.050
It is thought that about 300,000
undocumented immigrants live

00:27:20.050 --> 00:27:24.160
in Puerto Rico, most of them
members of the Dominican

00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:28.140
Republic community.

00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:31.830
Now, when I went into office
I signed an executive order

00:27:31.830 --> 00:27:37.310
saying that no woman
was going to be asked

00:27:37.310 --> 00:27:39.260
for their migratory status.

00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:42.320
Because you see, the law
states that they can give birth

00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:44.690
in an emergency
room, but the law

00:27:44.690 --> 00:27:49.060
does not give them the
right to have prenatal care.

00:27:49.060 --> 00:27:49.930
So what do you have?

00:27:49.930 --> 00:27:51.910
You have a lot of
babies that don't

00:27:51.910 --> 00:27:53.350
have the appropriate care.

00:27:53.350 --> 00:27:56.285
And then they are born,
and they are born citizens.

00:27:58.990 --> 00:28:01.360
They are born citizens
of a country that

00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:05.670
is a colony, out of
parents that don't

00:28:05.670 --> 00:28:07.500
have the necessary paperwork.

00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:12.380
If I thought I had it
difficult, that really

00:28:12.380 --> 00:28:15.800
takes it to another level.

00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:20.430
So now, any woman,
no matter what,

00:28:20.430 --> 00:28:23.910
can receive prenatal
care, can deliver,

00:28:23.910 --> 00:28:27.360
and can have postnatal care
in the city of San Juan.

00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:30.240
We also took away the
five-year restriction

00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:34.160
that you have to wait
to receive medical care.

00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:37.820
Now, is there anybody
here from Mexico?

00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:40.100
I was going to ask you
if you have given birth,

00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:43.670
but obviously it's not the case.

00:28:43.670 --> 00:28:45.020
Do you have a kid?

00:28:45.020 --> 00:28:47.730
No.

00:28:47.730 --> 00:28:50.720
Anybody here from
another country?

00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:51.810
A woman.

00:28:51.810 --> 00:28:52.970
You have children?

00:28:52.970 --> 00:28:54.320
- No.

00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:56.570
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:56.570 --> 00:28:57.260
- You do?

00:28:57.260 --> 00:28:58.594
Where are you from?

00:28:58.594 --> 00:28:59.570
- Argentina.

00:28:59.570 --> 00:29:01.570
- Argentina.

00:29:01.570 --> 00:29:03.930
I guarantee you--
what is your name?

00:29:03.930 --> 00:29:04.750
- Patricia.

00:29:04.750 --> 00:29:05.380
- Patricia.

00:29:05.380 --> 00:29:07.960
I guarantee you
that Patricia's pain

00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:12.000
when she gave birth was the same
pain I felt when I give birth

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.510
29 years ago.

00:29:14.510 --> 00:29:17.250
There's no difference.

00:29:17.250 --> 00:29:19.390
And I guarantee
you that the pain

00:29:19.390 --> 00:29:23.770
of a Native American
mother that wants her child

00:29:23.770 --> 00:29:28.090
to grow up and thrive
is the same pain

00:29:28.090 --> 00:29:31.070
of a woman in the
South Bronx that

00:29:31.070 --> 00:29:35.820
wants her children to be born
not having the highest asthma

00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:38.970
rates in the United States.

00:29:38.970 --> 00:29:41.820
And I guarantee
you the people that

00:29:41.820 --> 00:29:45.570
lived after Katrina felt
the same sorrow that we

00:29:45.570 --> 00:29:48.387
felt after the hurricane.

00:29:51.970 --> 00:29:54.880
They didn't get the
help they needed,

00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:57.730
we didn't get the
help we needed.

00:29:57.730 --> 00:30:01.210
And I've often been asked why.

00:30:01.210 --> 00:30:03.530
I don't know why.

00:30:03.530 --> 00:30:05.350
It could be because
of administrations

00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:12.710
that are racist, that see
people of color as disposable.

00:30:12.710 --> 00:30:15.830
It could be the ugly truth
that people just don't

00:30:15.830 --> 00:30:17.390
care about the lives of others.

00:30:17.390 --> 00:30:24.210
And I can tell you that in
the midst of darkness, all

00:30:24.210 --> 00:30:27.840
you want is for somebody to
tell you your life matters.

00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:33.660
I saw people just
rummaging through what

00:30:33.660 --> 00:30:40.740
was their homes, with nothing
but debris in front of them.

00:30:40.740 --> 00:30:45.940
I saw mothers, and
fathers, and grandkids

00:30:45.940 --> 00:30:50.880
telling me don't worry
Mayor, help will come.

00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:53.180
The US will not let us die.

00:30:57.150 --> 00:31:00.280
This is not a political thing.

00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:03.070
It was never about politics.

00:31:03.070 --> 00:31:05.910
It was about saving our lives.

00:31:05.910 --> 00:31:10.940
And unfortunately, the current
incumbent of the White House

00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:13.416
never got it.

00:31:13.416 --> 00:31:16.010
He never got it.

00:31:16.010 --> 00:31:19.370
This isn't about giving help.

00:31:19.370 --> 00:31:22.670
This is about meeting
a legal imperative

00:31:22.670 --> 00:31:26.010
and a moral imperative.

00:31:26.010 --> 00:31:29.670
Because when you put boots on
the ground in another country,

00:31:29.670 --> 00:31:32.990
you have a moral
imperative to help.

00:31:32.990 --> 00:31:35.300
And when you have
made those people

00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:39.980
citizens of your country,
you have a legal imperative

00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:42.240
to help.

00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:46.350
And then the great conundrum
keeps getting even bigger,

00:31:46.350 --> 00:31:49.710
because while the Trump
Administration turned

00:31:49.710 --> 00:31:54.180
his back on us,
the American people

00:31:54.180 --> 00:31:57.670
were there to take care of us.

00:31:57.670 --> 00:32:03.598
320 AFL CIO workers got into
San Juan about two weeks.

00:32:03.598 --> 00:32:05.390
You know, when the
President was telling us

00:32:05.390 --> 00:32:07.430
that the logistics
were too difficult?

00:32:07.430 --> 00:32:11.960
Because as he said, and I
quote, "You are an island,

00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:13.340
surrounded by water.

00:32:15.950 --> 00:32:18.330
Lots and lots of water.

00:32:18.330 --> 00:32:19.850
Ocean water."

00:32:19.850 --> 00:32:20.480
No shit.

00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:22.190
We didn't know that
until he said it.

00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:26.210
Thank you Mr. President.

00:32:26.210 --> 00:32:29.590
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:29.590 --> 00:32:34.720
And we were getting FEMA
people to ask us for--

00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:39.010
I'm sorry Mayor, how much
water would you be needing?

00:32:39.010 --> 00:32:40.750
And I'm like, I'm sorry?

00:32:40.750 --> 00:32:43.920
How much water would
it be good enough?

00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:47.440
And San Juan is the
largest municipality,

00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:50.380
so we had enough water, enough
food, enough medication,

00:32:50.380 --> 00:32:53.050
enough medical equipment
and enough medical supplies

00:32:53.050 --> 00:32:56.030
for two months.

00:32:56.030 --> 00:32:57.740
I did not count
on having to take

00:32:57.740 --> 00:33:03.800
care of 65 elderly
homes that were not

00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:05.690
run by the municipality.

00:33:05.690 --> 00:33:10.100
I did not think that I would
have to care for and help

00:33:10.100 --> 00:33:11.870
other hospitals.

00:33:11.870 --> 00:33:13.280
I did not think
that I would have

00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:16.550
to care for and help other
cities, but I did it,

00:33:16.550 --> 00:33:19.620
and I was harshly
criticized in Puerto Rico.

00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:25.680
Which one of you
would turn your backs

00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:29.020
on anybody that falls down on
the street and would not say,

00:33:29.020 --> 00:33:31.380
are you OK?

00:33:31.380 --> 00:33:33.900
So I did what I had to do.

00:33:33.900 --> 00:33:37.200
I'm not very big,
as you can see.

00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:38.700
And my mother will
be highly upset,

00:33:38.700 --> 00:33:40.908
because I'm supposed to be
standing behind the podium

00:33:40.908 --> 00:33:43.571
and not show you I'm
wearing sneakers right now.

00:33:43.571 --> 00:33:45.730
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:45.730 --> 00:33:50.620
I swear, Mom, my
shoes are in the bag.

00:33:50.620 --> 00:33:54.850
But my grandmother, who was
a very courageous woman,

00:33:54.850 --> 00:33:59.860
as most women are, said to
me, look, you're too little.

00:33:59.860 --> 00:34:04.100
So when you go to the
sandbox, never start a fight.

00:34:04.100 --> 00:34:05.830
Never.

00:34:05.830 --> 00:34:08.810
But I'll tell you what.

00:34:08.810 --> 00:34:11.000
I don't know what the
average age here is,

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:15.230
but when I was growing up we
had those Aladdin lunchboxes,

00:34:15.230 --> 00:34:18.679
they were made out of
metal they were very heavy.

00:34:18.679 --> 00:34:20.780
And I don't advocate
violence, I'm

00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:24.052
just telling you the
story of what she told me.

00:34:24.052 --> 00:34:25.760
So she said, this is
what you have to do.

00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:29.320
You have to hit them very
hard once with that lunchbox.

00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:31.639
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:31.639 --> 00:34:33.679
You're not going to have
more than one chance,

00:34:33.679 --> 00:34:36.739
so once you hit them
you throw the lunchbox,

00:34:36.739 --> 00:34:40.860
you scream as hard as you can,
and you run as fast as you can.

00:34:43.870 --> 00:34:47.520
So in the midst of all
that pain and sorrow

00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:49.889
I did what my
grandmother taught me.

00:34:52.679 --> 00:34:59.310
I screamed for those that could
not scream for themselves.

00:34:59.310 --> 00:35:01.980
And in the midst of all
that, people were saying,

00:35:01.980 --> 00:35:06.660
don't worry, Mayor,
they'll come.

00:35:06.660 --> 00:35:08.526
They promised.

00:35:08.526 --> 00:35:12.420
They're not going to let us die.

00:35:12.420 --> 00:35:14.120
A few weeks after
the hurricane it

00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:18.020
was evident that he was
going to let us die.

00:35:20.670 --> 00:35:22.350
That our lives did
not matter to him.

00:35:25.810 --> 00:35:28.085
That being a citizen
was not enough.

00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:35.120
So I did what I could do, and
I would do it again every day

00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:37.830
of my life.

00:35:37.830 --> 00:35:40.920
Because I saw the gazed
looks in people's eyes

00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:43.850
because they didn't
have chemotherapy,

00:35:43.850 --> 00:35:46.520
or they didn't have
dialysis for weeks.

00:35:52.090 --> 00:35:56.050
3,000 of us died.

00:35:56.050 --> 00:36:01.880
3,000 that did not open
their eyes today because some

00:36:01.880 --> 00:36:06.450
decided to play politics and
look good rather than doing

00:36:06.450 --> 00:36:07.920
what they were supposed to do.

00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:11.840
Because they did
not, they did not

00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:15.560
look at the moral imperative
above the legal imperative

00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:17.540
of citizenship.

00:36:17.540 --> 00:36:21.090
And as we become
citizens of the world,

00:36:21.090 --> 00:36:23.490
we must really take
a look at that.

00:36:29.130 --> 00:36:34.170
We should be tearing down
walls not building walls

00:36:34.170 --> 00:36:38.470
of bigotry and discrimination.

00:36:38.470 --> 00:36:42.400
We should be putting
together schools,

00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:46.270
not closing schools like
we are in Puerto Rico.

00:36:46.270 --> 00:36:51.010
Because we had Hurricane
Irma September 5,

00:36:51.010 --> 00:36:54.970
and we had Hurricane Maria
September 20, but before that,

00:36:54.970 --> 00:36:59.260
we had Hurricane
fiscal control board.

00:36:59.260 --> 00:37:05.590
As an act of extreme, and
blatant, and raw colonialism,

00:37:05.590 --> 00:37:08.670
US Congress empowered seven--

00:37:08.670 --> 00:37:11.640
seven people not elected
by the Puerto Rican people.

00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:16.180
Now, mind you, our democracy
is marginal at best.

00:37:16.180 --> 00:37:20.900
But there are elected by
the people of Puerto Rico.

00:37:20.900 --> 00:37:24.790
Seven people, and in the
legislation that's called

00:37:24.790 --> 00:37:26.590
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
which means promise,

00:37:26.590 --> 00:37:29.830
and the only promise they have
kept is to the hedge funds

00:37:29.830 --> 00:37:31.030
and to Wall Street.

00:37:31.030 --> 00:37:34.060
They have not kept their promise
to the people of Puerto Rico.

00:37:34.060 --> 00:37:37.240
I was always opposed to
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH],,

00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:38.950
and what was I called?

00:37:38.950 --> 00:37:40.807
A socialist and a communist.

00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:52.050
Threatening to reduce pensions.

00:37:52.050 --> 00:37:53.880
Now, the average
pension in Puerto Rico's

00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:55.375
about $600 dollars a month.

00:37:57.950 --> 00:38:01.320
Have reduced already
health benefits,

00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:06.790
have reduced the amount of money
that is spent on health care,

00:38:06.790 --> 00:38:09.580
are threatening
to close down some

00:38:09.580 --> 00:38:15.770
of the areas of the
University of Puerto Rico,

00:38:15.770 --> 00:38:18.500
have closed more
than 500 schools,

00:38:18.500 --> 00:38:23.000
and they say, well, you know
it's just people are leaving.

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:24.560
People are leaving Puerto Rico.

00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:26.930
Well, how about trying
to teach children the way

00:38:26.930 --> 00:38:28.390
we're supposed to teach them?

00:38:28.390 --> 00:38:32.690
Not with 25, 35, 45
cramped in a room,

00:38:32.690 --> 00:38:35.060
but maybe between
15 and 20, which

00:38:35.060 --> 00:38:38.420
is what anyone that knows
about teaching will tell you.

00:38:38.420 --> 00:38:40.820
How about treating
our children that

00:38:40.820 --> 00:38:43.820
have disabilities with
dignity, and ensuring

00:38:43.820 --> 00:38:45.540
that they have what they need?

00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:52.140
Austerity didn't
work anywhere else.

00:38:52.140 --> 00:38:54.270
What makes these
seven think it's

00:38:54.270 --> 00:38:56.160
going to work in Puerto Rico?

00:38:56.160 --> 00:38:57.450
What do they want?

00:38:57.450 --> 00:38:59.870
Our blood?

00:38:59.870 --> 00:39:00.730
What do they need?

00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:06.770
So those that believe
that statehood--

00:39:06.770 --> 00:39:11.710
erroneously so-- will
bring them full equality--

00:39:11.710 --> 00:39:16.450
because it's not Disneyland,
I can tell you that--

00:39:16.450 --> 00:39:21.660
should have a right
through a process

00:39:21.660 --> 00:39:24.060
where all the voices are heard.

00:39:24.060 --> 00:39:25.860
Those that want
independence, those

00:39:25.860 --> 00:39:27.990
that want free
association, those that

00:39:27.990 --> 00:39:30.630
want an enhanced commonwealth.

00:39:30.630 --> 00:39:32.060
We should all have a right.

00:39:32.060 --> 00:39:38.640
Yesterday, Congressman
Darren Soto from Florida

00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:41.700
put forth a legislation to
make Puerto Rico a state

00:39:41.700 --> 00:39:44.190
without consulting the
Puerto Rican people.

00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:50.730
And that's not
American democracy.

00:39:50.730 --> 00:39:54.030
That's not the land of the
free and the home of the brave.

00:39:54.030 --> 00:39:58.260
That's not the spirit
that held our hands,

00:39:58.260 --> 00:40:02.070
and fed us, and gave
us water, and tended

00:40:02.070 --> 00:40:06.660
to a wound of hundreds of
loving American people that

00:40:06.660 --> 00:40:10.197
have gone to Puerto
Rico to take care of us.

00:40:14.440 --> 00:40:21.390
30,000 rooftops are still
blue tarps or blue roofs.

00:40:21.390 --> 00:40:23.150
That means that in
a tropical storm

00:40:23.150 --> 00:40:27.000
120,000 people are going to have
to be taken out of harm's way.

00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:34.260
And this morning I
was watching, and I

00:40:34.260 --> 00:40:37.920
am, to my brothers and sisters
from the indigenous people,

00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:40.260
I'm sorry, I don't remember.

00:40:40.260 --> 00:40:46.220
It was a reservation that has
been flooded for two weeks.

00:40:46.220 --> 00:40:49.650
Pine Ridge, that was it.

00:40:49.650 --> 00:40:55.180
And I could hear this man
pleading for the same thing

00:40:55.180 --> 00:40:57.070
that I was pleading.

00:40:57.070 --> 00:41:05.170
Water, food, acknowledgment that
his life and his people's lives

00:41:05.170 --> 00:41:06.520
matter.

00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:10.548
He's a US citizen,
but he's also a member

00:41:10.548 --> 00:41:11.590
of his particular nation.

00:41:16.670 --> 00:41:21.410
I can tell you one
thing I am an expert on.

00:41:27.480 --> 00:41:28.800
And I wish I didn't have to be.

00:41:31.770 --> 00:41:37.900
I'm an expert at seeing
people struggling for,

00:41:37.900 --> 00:41:42.840
gasping for air.

00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:45.670
People going to
hospitals and saying,

00:41:45.670 --> 00:41:48.570
I don't have oxygen in
my home, and my mother

00:41:48.570 --> 00:41:53.610
is going to die if I
don't give her oxygen.

00:41:53.610 --> 00:41:58.820
And again I will say it,
I could not fathom why--

00:41:58.820 --> 00:42:03.320
why would anybody think
of us in a different way,

00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:09.020
or are we not entitled
to the unalienable rights

00:42:09.020 --> 00:42:14.370
of life, liberty, and
the pursuit of happiness?

00:42:14.370 --> 00:42:16.320
Aren't we all?

00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:18.720
No matter where we come
from, no matter who we love,

00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:21.810
no matter the color of our
skin, no matter our religion,

00:42:21.810 --> 00:42:25.200
aren't we all, no matter
where we live in the world,

00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:28.170
isn't it more important to
be a citizen of the world

00:42:28.170 --> 00:42:33.920
and have shared moral
values than to not

00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:38.350
be able to participate
appropriately?

00:42:38.350 --> 00:42:40.630
So we are unsettled.

00:42:40.630 --> 00:42:41.340
We are unhinged.

00:42:44.710 --> 00:42:50.620
But we are not without any hope.

00:42:50.620 --> 00:42:56.220
What I did see was that when
people need to come together,

00:42:56.220 --> 00:42:59.780
nobody has to write a memo.

00:42:59.780 --> 00:43:03.580
Nobody asks for the
number of gallons.

00:43:03.580 --> 00:43:07.050
Operation Blessing, a
nongovernmental organization

00:43:07.050 --> 00:43:09.340
out a Pat Robertson's
organization

00:43:09.340 --> 00:43:11.020
just knocked on
my door literally,

00:43:11.020 --> 00:43:13.210
and said we're from
Operation Blessing

00:43:13.210 --> 00:43:16.060
and we're here to help.

00:43:16.060 --> 00:43:21.480
Oxfam, private institutions,
the city of Boston,

00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:23.070
the city of New York.

00:43:23.070 --> 00:43:26.130
Mayor Bill de Blasio
sent crew, after crew,

00:43:26.130 --> 00:43:29.820
after crew of people from
Emergency Management System.

00:43:29.820 --> 00:43:31.230
Because we were citizens?

00:43:31.230 --> 00:43:32.760
No.

00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:35.140
Because we were humans.

00:43:35.140 --> 00:43:37.740
Because we were in need.

00:43:37.740 --> 00:43:40.620
And because we have
a shared commonality

00:43:40.620 --> 00:43:44.460
and an understanding that
when people are in pain

00:43:44.460 --> 00:43:47.710
you take care of them.

00:43:47.710 --> 00:43:51.030
I was listening to you speak
this morning about Paris.

00:43:56.160 --> 00:44:00.420
The world is filled with
different experiments

00:44:00.420 --> 00:44:01.230
of democracy.

00:44:03.890 --> 00:44:05.450
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:44:05.450 --> 00:44:07.190
You can say it in French.

00:44:07.190 --> 00:44:07.715
What is it?

00:44:07.715 --> 00:44:08.548
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:44:08.548 --> 00:44:11.300
- [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:44:11.300 --> 00:44:15.200
- [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:18.080
Sounds eerily similar to
life, liberty, and the pursuit

00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:20.890
of happiness, right?

00:44:20.890 --> 00:44:24.340
Have you ever met a
young boy or a young girl

00:44:24.340 --> 00:44:31.226
that says when I grow up
I want to be a prostitute?

00:44:31.226 --> 00:44:34.220
No.

00:44:34.220 --> 00:44:36.800
When I grow up, I'm going
to lead a life of crime.

00:44:39.626 --> 00:44:41.990
No.

00:44:41.990 --> 00:44:44.630
Children are children.

00:44:44.630 --> 00:44:46.780
They are children
if they have walked

00:44:46.780 --> 00:44:48.820
thousands of miles
to come to the border

00:44:48.820 --> 00:44:55.940
to a country they were told
will open her arms to them.

00:44:59.380 --> 00:45:00.520
This is a great nation.

00:45:03.870 --> 00:45:06.300
This is a great nation.

00:45:06.300 --> 00:45:08.580
And there is no duplicity
in what I'm saying.

00:45:08.580 --> 00:45:13.380
I want more sovereign powers
for my nation in an association

00:45:13.380 --> 00:45:15.490
with your nation.

00:45:15.490 --> 00:45:19.110
Because the bonds
that bring us together

00:45:19.110 --> 00:45:22.920
are so much stronger than the
bonds that may set us apart.

00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:31.060
I'll tell you this
one last thing.

00:45:31.060 --> 00:45:35.500
Yesterday President Trump
mentioned my name again

00:45:35.500 --> 00:45:41.022
as he was walking to
get on his helicopter.

00:45:45.420 --> 00:45:47.800
I'm right here.

00:45:47.800 --> 00:45:51.490
He can have at me all he wants.

00:45:51.490 --> 00:45:56.900
But I will never stop
fighting for injustice.

00:45:56.900 --> 00:46:00.500
I will never stop fighting for
the eradication of poverty.

00:46:00.500 --> 00:46:03.020
1.3 million Puerto Ricans--

00:46:03.020 --> 00:46:08.480
1.3 million out of
3.2 million receive

00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:11.330
some sort of
nutritional assistance

00:46:11.330 --> 00:46:13.390
to put food on the table.

00:46:13.390 --> 00:46:19.148
And out of that, 45% percent
are elderly, disabled adults,

00:46:19.148 --> 00:46:19.690
and children.

00:46:22.450 --> 00:46:25.870
It makes perfect
sense to make sure

00:46:25.870 --> 00:46:30.190
that the economy in
Puerto Rico is not subdued

00:46:30.190 --> 00:46:32.883
to the American economy.

00:46:32.883 --> 00:46:34.300
I don't how many
of you know this,

00:46:34.300 --> 00:46:38.140
but we cannot buy things from
the countries that you buy

00:46:38.140 --> 00:46:39.770
things.

00:46:39.770 --> 00:46:41.520
There's this little
thing called the Jones

00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:44.430
Act that says that we
have to buy everything

00:46:44.430 --> 00:46:46.800
through American ships.

00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:48.450
And because we are an island--

00:46:48.450 --> 00:46:54.190
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:54.190 --> 00:46:55.850
I couldn't believe
when I heard it.

00:46:55.850 --> 00:47:02.440
And then it became a skit
on Saturday Night Live.

00:47:02.440 --> 00:47:03.850
So this is what happens.

00:47:03.850 --> 00:47:07.420
At one point, we produce
13 out of the most

00:47:07.420 --> 00:47:11.500
used 21 drugs in the world.

00:47:11.500 --> 00:47:13.420
Prescription drugs.

00:47:13.420 --> 00:47:16.810
But we would package
them, put them in boxes,

00:47:16.810 --> 00:47:20.260
ship them to the US, and
then repatriate them.

00:47:20.260 --> 00:47:25.000
And the people that were
responsible for making them

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:26.920
could not afford them.

00:47:29.620 --> 00:47:33.370
Today, today, could not.

00:47:33.370 --> 00:47:35.140
They cannot afford them.

00:47:35.140 --> 00:47:41.270
And we see this at the
drugstore every day.

00:47:41.270 --> 00:47:44.820
An old person, an
elderly person.

00:47:44.820 --> 00:47:46.770
We call them
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]..

00:47:46.770 --> 00:47:48.330
It's a term of endearing.

00:47:51.690 --> 00:47:56.210
Talking to the drugstore
pharmacist and saying

00:47:56.210 --> 00:48:02.070
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH],,
I have $20.

00:48:02.070 --> 00:48:05.400
How much of the heart medication
for the month will that buy me?

00:48:07.940 --> 00:48:11.870
And the pharmacist says,
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH],,

00:48:11.870 --> 00:48:16.120
that will only get
you a week's worth.

00:48:16.120 --> 00:48:20.360
So it is our
responsibility, all of us,

00:48:20.360 --> 00:48:21.875
to make sure that that stops.

00:48:24.930 --> 00:48:32.100
Because what once was the
promise of help turned very

00:48:32.100 --> 00:48:36.323
quickly into the following
words, [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH],,

00:48:36.323 --> 00:48:37.115
they're not coming.

00:48:39.860 --> 00:48:40.901
They are not coming.

00:48:49.080 --> 00:48:49.950
It makes you mad.

00:48:52.820 --> 00:48:58.970
Because it isn't that he
couldn't, it's that he

00:48:58.970 --> 00:48:59.470
wouldn't.

00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:04.800
But then you
understand that there

00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:08.100
are others that
come to your help,

00:49:08.100 --> 00:49:11.422
and you understand that there
are others that understand.

00:49:11.422 --> 00:49:13.130
And you understand
that there is a shared

00:49:13.130 --> 00:49:14.750
humanity that goes beyond.

00:49:14.750 --> 00:49:17.660
And even those that want
to sow hate and division

00:49:17.660 --> 00:49:21.420
are crushed by
little kids that just

00:49:21.420 --> 00:49:25.780
have a lunchbox in their hand.

00:49:25.780 --> 00:49:29.740
I didn't do what
I did to be brave.

00:49:29.740 --> 00:49:31.397
I did it because I had to.

00:49:34.600 --> 00:49:38.660
Because I was tired
of seeing the people

00:49:38.660 --> 00:49:43.730
that I love and care for die.

00:49:43.730 --> 00:49:46.620
We can change the world.

00:49:46.620 --> 00:49:48.630
We can change our neighborhoods.

00:49:48.630 --> 00:49:50.220
We can do it together.

00:49:50.220 --> 00:49:53.130
We don't have to be at
each other's throats.

00:49:53.130 --> 00:49:55.920
This isn't an issue of
being anti-American.

00:49:55.920 --> 00:49:59.640
This is an issue of ensuring
that the light, the beacon

00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:04.300
of light that this country
has been for hundreds of years

00:50:04.300 --> 00:50:07.480
shines bright.

00:50:07.480 --> 00:50:11.590
Not because others are
subdued, but because others are

00:50:11.590 --> 00:50:14.750
given the freedom to decide.

00:50:14.750 --> 00:50:18.720
That is the American way.

00:50:18.720 --> 00:50:22.800
That is what we can
accomplish together.

00:50:22.800 --> 00:50:25.020
And it doesn't matter
if you're in France,

00:50:25.020 --> 00:50:26.820
it does matter if
you're in Turkey,

00:50:26.820 --> 00:50:28.740
it doesn't matter if
you're in Argentina,

00:50:28.740 --> 00:50:32.400
it doesn't matter if
you are in New Orleans,

00:50:32.400 --> 00:50:36.210
we all deserve to
have a better life.

00:50:36.210 --> 00:50:38.960
We all want to hear these words.

00:50:38.960 --> 00:50:41.630
Ellen DeGeneres sent
me the best tweet ever.

00:50:41.630 --> 00:50:49.250
She said, "Mayor, I see you,
I hear you, I love you."

00:50:49.250 --> 00:50:52.080
Let's see each other.

00:50:52.080 --> 00:50:54.550
Let's hear each other.

00:50:54.550 --> 00:50:56.070
Let's love each other.

00:50:56.070 --> 00:51:00.120
Let not people die
senseless deaths.

00:51:03.080 --> 00:51:07.320
Not only did they die,
but then the President

00:51:07.320 --> 00:51:11.590
tried to rob us and deny us of
the right to feel that pain.

00:51:14.120 --> 00:51:16.200
And he said yesterday,
$91 billions

00:51:16.200 --> 00:51:17.550
have been given to Puerto Rico.

00:51:17.550 --> 00:51:19.860
That is just not true.

00:51:19.860 --> 00:51:22.890
$91 billion is what
it seems like it's

00:51:22.890 --> 00:51:25.134
going to take to get it done.

00:51:27.980 --> 00:51:30.120
It's not about the money.

00:51:30.120 --> 00:51:32.070
It's not about politics.

00:51:32.070 --> 00:51:34.160
It's not about
Republicans or Democrats.

00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:36.860
It's about a common
and shared humanity.

00:51:36.860 --> 00:51:39.207
A common and shared goal
of changing the world

00:51:39.207 --> 00:51:40.290
to make it a better place.

00:51:43.630 --> 00:51:44.733
We can do it together.

00:51:48.990 --> 00:51:54.280
I just want to finish by
thanking anybody and everybody

00:51:54.280 --> 00:51:58.340
that didn't look the other way.

00:51:58.340 --> 00:52:00.680
Because even though
you may have not

00:52:00.680 --> 00:52:03.980
known it, if you sent a bottle
of water to Puerto Rico,

00:52:03.980 --> 00:52:05.360
you saved a life.

00:52:10.050 --> 00:52:11.385
I'm not good at starting fights.

00:52:13.950 --> 00:52:17.670
That's not my good suit.

00:52:17.670 --> 00:52:23.050
But I am my grandmother's
granddaughter.

00:52:23.050 --> 00:52:28.220
And for as long as I live,
I'll hit as hard as I can,

00:52:28.220 --> 00:52:31.370
I'll scream as loud
as I can, and I

00:52:31.370 --> 00:52:35.540
will run as fast as I
can because I am still

00:52:35.540 --> 00:52:40.880
fearful that from wherever she
may be, she will look at me

00:52:40.880 --> 00:52:43.850
and say don't ever,
ever start a fight,

00:52:43.850 --> 00:52:50.900
but never, never stop until
you have finished one.

00:52:50.900 --> 00:52:52.850
Let's change the world together.

00:52:52.850 --> 00:52:53.450
We can do it.

00:52:53.450 --> 00:52:55.209
Thank you very much.

00:52:55.209 --> 00:52:59.201
[APPLAUSE]

00:53:01.197 --> 00:53:02.195
Thank you.

00:53:05.189 --> 00:53:06.187
Thank you.

00:53:11.177 --> 00:53:12.674
Thank you very much.

00:53:31.635 --> 00:53:32.135
- Thank you.

00:53:32.135 --> 00:53:34.200
Thank you so much.

00:53:34.200 --> 00:53:41.640
Now it's time for Q and A. So
we have a microphone there.

00:53:41.640 --> 00:53:47.000
I'm going to ask that you
observe the same Ken Mack/Phil

00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:50.900
Deloria rules that we laid out
earlier, namely that you ask

00:53:50.900 --> 00:53:57.710
a question respectfully to our
wonderful guest and speaker,

00:53:57.710 --> 00:54:01.310
and save time for those
in the queue behind you

00:54:01.310 --> 00:54:04.370
so we can get a
variety of voices in.

00:54:07.410 --> 00:54:09.280
- Thank you for coming.

00:54:09.280 --> 00:54:12.030
My name is Julia Carpenter,
and you mentioned

00:54:12.030 --> 00:54:13.920
something called the Jones Act.

00:54:13.920 --> 00:54:14.460
- Mm-hmm.

00:54:14.460 --> 00:54:16.470
- I have never heard
of that before.

00:54:16.470 --> 00:54:18.420
I'm hoping that you'll
tell us more about it.

00:54:18.420 --> 00:54:19.590
- Yeah, sure.

00:54:19.590 --> 00:54:21.446
Where are you from, Julia?

00:54:21.446 --> 00:54:22.700
- Originally, or?

00:54:22.700 --> 00:54:23.868
- Yeah.

00:54:23.868 --> 00:54:25.080
- Rochester, New York.

00:54:25.080 --> 00:54:26.550
- Rochester, New York.

00:54:26.550 --> 00:54:30.540
So part of the issue with
Puerto Rico, as you know,

00:54:30.540 --> 00:54:34.770
is that it is the smallest
of the largest Antilles.

00:54:34.770 --> 00:54:40.440
So we are very well
positioned for the Cold War.

00:54:40.440 --> 00:54:44.070
So in the Cold War, any
ships, like you know,

00:54:44.070 --> 00:54:51.270
the Cuban Missile Crisis, they
were expected to be halted.

00:54:51.270 --> 00:54:53.340
We also were used
for many years,

00:54:53.340 --> 00:54:56.940
the small municipal island
of Vieques and Culebra

00:54:56.940 --> 00:54:58.950
were used for many
years by the Navy,

00:54:58.950 --> 00:55:03.330
and they would literally
shoot and throw

00:55:03.330 --> 00:55:07.720
bombs in live civilian
population at the beaches

00:55:07.720 --> 00:55:08.220
there.

00:55:08.220 --> 00:55:10.180
Agent Orange was
tried in Puerto Rico,

00:55:10.180 --> 00:55:12.810
the contraceptive pill
was tried in Puerto Rico.

00:55:15.750 --> 00:55:22.650
But the Jones Act is
part of using finances

00:55:22.650 --> 00:55:26.730
as a colonial domination tool.

00:55:26.730 --> 00:55:30.840
So it says that any ship that
goes into Puerto Rico first--

00:55:30.840 --> 00:55:32.670
let's say they come from Spain--

00:55:32.670 --> 00:55:35.500
goes to Puerto Rico first,
cannot come into the United

00:55:35.500 --> 00:55:37.920
States.

00:55:37.920 --> 00:55:40.800
So what they do
is that they force

00:55:40.800 --> 00:55:45.320
us to use only ships
which are US flagships.

00:55:47.930 --> 00:55:52.610
A lot of studies have
come out, and say

00:55:52.610 --> 00:55:57.320
that between 130%
and 151% increase

00:55:57.320 --> 00:56:00.560
in the cost of living in
Puerto Rico because of that.

00:56:00.560 --> 00:56:03.640
Now, not only does that
have an issue with--

00:56:03.640 --> 00:56:09.240
and what I'll do is I'll
send the Radcliffe Institute

00:56:09.240 --> 00:56:12.860
the threads and the
links for these studies

00:56:12.860 --> 00:56:15.650
that have just been released.

00:56:15.650 --> 00:56:18.170
But one of the things
that is also important

00:56:18.170 --> 00:56:24.910
is that during the
hurricane, because the--

00:56:24.910 --> 00:56:27.340
that's the divine mercy.

00:56:27.340 --> 00:56:32.380
That's my only,
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]..

00:56:32.380 --> 00:56:37.920
During the storm,
because there was Harvey,

00:56:37.920 --> 00:56:42.280
and because there were other
really climate change-related

00:56:42.280 --> 00:56:47.710
disasters, there was not
enough lampposts or generators

00:56:47.710 --> 00:56:49.300
in the United States.

00:56:49.300 --> 00:56:51.790
So you would think
that we could buy them

00:56:51.790 --> 00:56:54.220
from the same countries
that the US buys them.

00:56:54.220 --> 00:56:57.140
We weren't allowed to do that.

00:56:57.140 --> 00:57:00.850
So consequently,
about 60% to 70%

00:57:00.850 --> 00:57:04.060
of the Puerto Rican population
went without electricity

00:57:04.060 --> 00:57:06.170
for one year.

00:57:06.170 --> 00:57:07.840
In San Juan we were lucky.

00:57:07.840 --> 00:57:10.450
I lived in a shelter
for four months,

00:57:10.450 --> 00:57:15.400
and San Juan got about
between four and six months--

00:57:15.400 --> 00:57:19.090
by the end of six months
everybody had electricity.

00:57:19.090 --> 00:57:22.120
We didn't want electricity
to take warm showers

00:57:22.120 --> 00:57:24.400
or have air conditioning,
we wanted it

00:57:24.400 --> 00:57:27.730
so that doctors did
not have to operate

00:57:27.730 --> 00:57:29.920
with the light on
their cell phone.

00:57:29.920 --> 00:57:32.260
That's what we wanted
electricity for.

00:57:32.260 --> 00:57:35.590
So the Jones Act takes
a number of ships--

00:57:35.590 --> 00:57:40.990
it's not the entire US
merchant marine fleet--

00:57:40.990 --> 00:57:45.850
and forces us to only use
US ships, which, in a way,

00:57:45.850 --> 00:57:47.770
it increases.

00:57:47.770 --> 00:57:52.030
Funny enough, President
Trump waived the Jones Act

00:57:52.030 --> 00:57:55.210
for seven days during
the aftermath of Irma,

00:57:55.210 --> 00:57:58.180
and 10 days during the
aftermath of Maria.

00:57:58.180 --> 00:58:01.120
No ships came from
anywhere because it

00:58:01.120 --> 00:58:06.670
was too small of a time frame
for them to be able to work.

00:58:06.670 --> 00:58:11.900
But USVI doesn't
have the Jones Act.

00:58:11.900 --> 00:58:15.440
Now when we say, look, we
need to repeal the Jones Act

00:58:15.440 --> 00:58:18.800
or at least put Puerto Rico on
a path to repealing the Jones

00:58:18.800 --> 00:58:20.990
Act, we are told it
has to do with an issue

00:58:20.990 --> 00:58:22.010
of national security.

00:58:22.010 --> 00:58:23.930
But what about USVI?

00:58:23.930 --> 00:58:27.150
You have to go through USVI
to come to Puerto Rico.

00:58:27.150 --> 00:58:32.120
So it isn't an issue
of national security,

00:58:32.120 --> 00:58:35.290
it is an issue of
financial domination.

00:58:35.290 --> 00:58:39.140
I have to thank our Maritime
brothers and sisters which

00:58:39.140 --> 00:58:42.620
at least have told
us that they're

00:58:42.620 --> 00:58:46.610
willing to sit down and
start talking about this.

00:58:46.610 --> 00:58:53.970
And from a very
bold no, to a let's

00:58:53.970 --> 00:58:56.580
sit down and start
talking about this,

00:58:56.580 --> 00:58:58.080
it is a step in the
right direction.

00:58:58.080 --> 00:59:00.150
But it would certainly
help Puerto Rico

00:59:00.150 --> 00:59:05.670
if we were not
subjected to that.

00:59:05.670 --> 00:59:06.210
Hi.

00:59:06.210 --> 00:59:06.840
- Hi.

00:59:06.840 --> 00:59:08.900
Ricardo Ortiz, and
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:59:08.900 --> 00:59:10.463
for your incredible
presentation.

00:59:10.463 --> 00:59:11.380
Powerful presentation.

00:59:11.380 --> 00:59:12.250
- Thank you.

00:59:12.250 --> 00:59:14.850
- And you indicated you
were a American citizen.

00:59:14.850 --> 00:59:17.325
Would you ever consider running
for president of the United

00:59:17.325 --> 00:59:17.825
States?

00:59:17.825 --> 00:59:19.950
[CHEERING]

00:59:19.950 --> 00:59:23.880
- I can't because I was born
in a territory, or in a colony.

00:59:23.880 --> 00:59:28.080
However, my daughter was born
in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

00:59:28.080 --> 00:59:30.330
So my daughter could
run, but she's not

00:59:30.330 --> 00:59:31.935
at all interested in politics.

00:59:34.470 --> 00:59:39.240
Somebody is selling
t-shirts in the web saying,

00:59:39.240 --> 00:59:40.830
Carmen Yulín for President.

00:59:40.830 --> 00:59:42.240
Nasty for the people.

00:59:42.240 --> 00:59:43.860
[LAUGHTER]

00:59:43.860 --> 00:59:49.730
Because the President told me
that I had been nasty to him.

00:59:49.730 --> 00:59:52.170
There's a lot of things
I could have been.

00:59:55.120 --> 00:59:55.620
Yes.

00:59:55.620 --> 00:59:57.300
Hi.

00:59:57.300 --> 00:59:59.220
- Hi, my name is
George Angel Barreras.

00:59:59.220 --> 01:00:01.053
I'm here on behalf of
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]..

01:00:01.053 --> 01:00:03.720
We're a nonprofit that
serves the ESL students here

01:00:03.720 --> 01:00:05.590
in Massachusetts and
the city of Boston.

01:00:05.590 --> 01:00:07.350
- What is that?

01:00:07.350 --> 01:00:08.700
[FINGERS SNAPPING]

01:00:08.700 --> 01:00:10.500
- It's clapping--quiet clapping.

01:00:10.500 --> 01:00:12.032
- This is quiet clapping.

01:00:12.032 --> 01:00:13.240
- An act of solidarity, yeah.

01:00:13.240 --> 01:00:13.740
- Oh.

01:00:13.740 --> 01:00:14.980
- Oh, OK.

01:00:14.980 --> 01:00:17.080
- So first, on behalf
of my Dominican heritage

01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:18.820
and my family, I want to
say [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH],,

01:00:18.820 --> 01:00:19.528
nice to meet you.

01:00:19.528 --> 01:00:21.940
Thank you so much for coming.

01:00:21.940 --> 01:00:24.500
Well, seeing as how the Jones
Act stopped a lot of ships

01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:26.500
for example coming into
Puerto Rico and had them

01:00:26.500 --> 01:00:29.810
docked in harbor for weeks
and months at a time,

01:00:29.810 --> 01:00:32.740
and then now we're seeing the
pictures as well of gallons

01:00:32.740 --> 01:00:36.323
of water bottles left by
FEMA in fields of Puerto Rico

01:00:36.323 --> 01:00:37.990
just sitting there
for months at a time.

01:00:37.990 --> 01:00:40.120
People needed them.

01:00:40.120 --> 01:00:42.460
Seeing how the federal
government of the United States

01:00:42.460 --> 01:00:47.140
failed in its effectiveness,
I know Elon Musk

01:00:47.140 --> 01:00:50.110
in particular offered to redo
the power grid in Puerto Rico

01:00:50.110 --> 01:00:51.970
to make it all clean energy.

01:00:51.970 --> 01:00:54.635
On behalf of not only
the Dominican Republic,

01:00:54.635 --> 01:00:56.260
Puerto Rico, the rest
of the Caribbean,

01:00:56.260 --> 01:00:58.510
and the Latin
ex-community as a whole,

01:00:58.510 --> 01:01:01.240
would you be open to having
a private entity like that

01:01:01.240 --> 01:01:02.350
collaborate with you--

01:01:02.350 --> 01:01:05.230
Tesla, for example-- to help
revolutionize the power grid

01:01:05.230 --> 01:01:07.720
and lead by example for
all other countries that

01:01:07.720 --> 01:01:09.550
will be affected by
climate change as well?

01:01:09.550 --> 01:01:14.380
- I have sent Elon Musk
messages in US national TV like,

01:01:14.380 --> 01:01:18.140
Elon Musk, here I am.

01:01:18.140 --> 01:01:19.740
But he doesn't like me, I think.

01:01:19.740 --> 01:01:24.310
But he went-- his company went
to Puerto Rico and did some

01:01:24.310 --> 01:01:26.670
very good work over there--

01:01:26.670 --> 01:01:31.690
Tesla-- especially with a
hospital that is for children,

01:01:31.690 --> 01:01:38.340
and put the solar panels
and the solar batteries.

01:01:38.340 --> 01:01:40.110
Through the Clinton
Foundation, we

01:01:40.110 --> 01:01:43.680
are energizing the largest
urban market in Puerto Rico.

01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:46.280
It's called
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]..

01:01:46.280 --> 01:01:49.710
It's going to take about 800
panels and Tesla batteries

01:01:49.710 --> 01:01:51.060
for it to operate.

01:01:51.060 --> 01:01:52.980
Why do we want to do that?

01:01:52.980 --> 01:01:58.530
Because it's about 300 very
small farmers or business

01:01:58.530 --> 01:02:03.030
people that couldn't really make
ends meet for about four months

01:02:03.030 --> 01:02:04.900
because there was no power.

01:02:04.900 --> 01:02:11.950
I did not think about true
green power until the hurricane.

01:02:11.950 --> 01:02:13.350
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

01:02:17.450 --> 01:02:19.130
I'll show you in a minute.

01:02:19.130 --> 01:02:20.780
But the answer is yes.

01:02:20.780 --> 01:02:23.930
I signed an executive
order that everything

01:02:23.930 --> 01:02:27.740
that we built in San Juan
from the municipal part

01:02:27.740 --> 01:02:31.790
is going to be
fully solar powered.

01:02:31.790 --> 01:02:36.050
So we will be beginning in the
next few weeks, just a small--

01:02:36.050 --> 01:02:40.820
it's small-- it's 12
homes-- nine homes,

01:02:40.820 --> 01:02:42.830
which will be for a particular--

01:02:42.830 --> 01:02:45.560
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]---- for a
particular area in San Juan

01:02:45.560 --> 01:02:48.860
that was totally devastated.

01:02:48.860 --> 01:02:52.370
And all of the homes are
going to be solar powered.

01:02:52.370 --> 01:02:55.880
But real solar power so you
can run the entire home.

01:02:55.880 --> 01:02:58.370
Not this thing about
just being able to run

01:02:58.370 --> 01:03:01.700
the TV in your house.

01:03:01.700 --> 01:03:06.710
But look, for Operation
Blessing, and Alice Chun,

01:03:06.710 --> 01:03:11.180
who is the creator of this,
came over to Puerto Rico

01:03:11.180 --> 01:03:14.060
and gave me this.

01:03:14.060 --> 01:03:15.320
I had never seen any of this.

01:03:15.320 --> 01:03:16.640
You can buy it in the internet.

01:03:19.510 --> 01:03:21.760
It's called a solar pump.

01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:24.520
I call it a cube of hope.

01:03:24.520 --> 01:03:27.040
Just imagine you're
in total darkness.

01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:30.360
I'm not sure if you could
turn the lights off here.

01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:34.210
This is-- it's got 91 lumens.

01:03:34.210 --> 01:03:36.040
Turn-- thank you so much.

01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:38.350
But it also allows
for something that

01:03:38.350 --> 01:03:41.020
is even much more important
in a crisis, which

01:03:41.020 --> 01:03:45.040
is to have a communication
when you have no communication.

01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:49.280
And it gives you an SOS signal.

01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:54.520
This is very simple,
and it's solar powered.

01:03:54.520 --> 01:03:56.530
You put it out
eight hours a day,

01:03:56.530 --> 01:03:59.950
and it gives you eight
hours a night of light.

01:03:59.950 --> 01:04:04.840
Operation Blessing handed
out-- and through the Hispanic

01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:05.980
Federation--

01:04:05.980 --> 01:04:10.360
about half a million of these
all throughout Puerto Rico.

01:04:10.360 --> 01:04:12.100
This is my new American Express.

01:04:12.100 --> 01:04:13.570
I never leave home without it.

01:04:13.570 --> 01:04:15.380
[LAUGHTER]

01:04:15.380 --> 01:04:16.490
But the answer is yes.

01:04:16.490 --> 01:04:20.080
So if you have a
connection, just

01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:22.207
let him know we're waiting.

01:04:22.207 --> 01:04:24.790
- And I know I'm not supposed
to really ask a second question,

01:04:24.790 --> 01:04:27.070
but just really quick just
because I've been freaking out

01:04:27.070 --> 01:04:28.653
the whole week looking
forward to this

01:04:28.653 --> 01:04:30.220
and I'm sweating a little bit.

01:04:30.220 --> 01:04:32.450
I just wanted to know,
can I have a hug?

01:04:32.450 --> 01:04:32.950
- Yes.

01:04:32.950 --> 01:04:36.387
[LAUGHTER]

01:04:37.860 --> 01:04:41.297
[APPLAUSE]

01:04:59.970 --> 01:05:02.408
How old are you?

01:05:02.408 --> 01:05:03.780
- 24.

01:05:03.780 --> 01:05:06.840
- 24 and he's been freaking out.

01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:07.770
I'm 56.

01:05:07.770 --> 01:05:09.270
I know I don't look
it, but I'm 56.

01:05:12.570 --> 01:05:13.650
Oh, you could be my son.

01:05:13.650 --> 01:05:14.428
[LAUGHTER]

01:05:14.428 --> 01:05:16.220
- That's why I called you tia.

01:05:16.220 --> 01:05:18.360
- Oh.

01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:19.060
Hi.

01:05:19.060 --> 01:05:21.210
- Hi.

01:05:21.210 --> 01:05:22.530
It's a simple enough question.

01:05:22.530 --> 01:05:24.130
We have a room full of people.

01:05:24.130 --> 01:05:27.240
I'm-- sorry, I'm throwing
something your way--

01:05:27.240 --> 01:05:29.100
I'm assuming everyone
here has some

01:05:29.100 --> 01:05:32.700
resources, some friends, some
connections, some knowledge.

01:05:32.700 --> 01:05:34.950
What do you need most?

01:05:34.950 --> 01:05:37.410
You are still
dealing with stuff.

01:05:37.410 --> 01:05:41.040
I assume they haven't sent
you $91 million dollars.

01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:42.540
And what do you need most?

01:05:42.540 --> 01:05:43.860
- We need three things.

01:05:43.860 --> 01:05:47.520
- And after that, if you can
tell people where to look,

01:05:47.520 --> 01:05:49.680
if it's something
they can't provide,

01:05:49.680 --> 01:05:52.260
to find out what else you need.

01:05:52.260 --> 01:05:53.420
- Thank you, by the way.

01:05:56.740 --> 01:06:02.970
One of the things we need is
forms and platforms like this.

01:06:02.970 --> 01:06:08.090
And for you all to become
ambassadors of hope

01:06:08.090 --> 01:06:12.710
for Puerto Rico, and
frankly for any other area--

01:06:12.710 --> 01:06:16.040
Pine Ridge, the
young man mentioned--

01:06:16.040 --> 01:06:18.500
but we need for Puerto
Rico to continue

01:06:18.500 --> 01:06:22.060
to be part of the conversation.

01:06:22.060 --> 01:06:25.210
Not to be an asterisk at
the end of a paragraph,

01:06:25.210 --> 01:06:27.770
but to continue to be
part of the conversation.

01:06:27.770 --> 01:06:31.120
So anything you see about
Puerto Rico, retweet,

01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:33.190
share on Facebook, and so forth.

01:06:33.190 --> 01:06:33.940
That's number one.

01:06:33.940 --> 01:06:39.520
Number two is we really need
the money that was allocated

01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:40.850
to get to Puerto Rico.

01:06:40.850 --> 01:06:43.750
So call your Congresswoman
or your Congressman,

01:06:43.750 --> 01:06:48.520
call your Senator and
tell them, hey, what up?

01:06:48.520 --> 01:06:50.600
Give us-- send the money down.

01:06:50.600 --> 01:06:53.710
It's been allocated.

01:06:53.710 --> 01:06:59.350
It's just an issue of not using
this in a vindictive behavior.

01:06:59.350 --> 01:07:02.990
And number three, like the
young man before you said,

01:07:02.990 --> 01:07:09.800
we need to make sure that
in a dual way we have power.

01:07:09.800 --> 01:07:13.220
Power that will
give us the ability

01:07:13.220 --> 01:07:19.800
to have a strong and
forceful economy,

01:07:19.800 --> 01:07:23.670
but also the power to decide.

01:07:23.670 --> 01:07:26.520
So if you could do
one thing, think

01:07:26.520 --> 01:07:31.530
about Puerto Rico and
our right to decide

01:07:31.530 --> 01:07:34.200
what the next step in our
relationship with the United

01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:36.210
States is.

01:07:36.210 --> 01:07:41.220
And help us ensure that
all the voices are heard.

01:07:41.220 --> 01:07:43.830
I've said to you once
what I believe in.

01:07:43.830 --> 01:07:46.350
I'm not trying to convince
you of what I believe in.

01:07:46.350 --> 01:07:47.820
I'm trying to ask
you to help me.

01:07:47.820 --> 01:07:49.050
You know Jerry Maguire?

01:07:49.050 --> 01:07:50.550
Help me help you.

01:07:50.550 --> 01:07:58.480
Well, help me tell Congress that
all voices need to be heard.

01:07:58.480 --> 01:08:01.260
And never forget us.

01:08:01.260 --> 01:08:02.700
Never forget us.

01:08:02.700 --> 01:08:05.490
Never forget anyone
that's in need.

01:08:05.490 --> 01:08:08.550
And if you're here,
it's because you don't.

01:08:08.550 --> 01:08:11.720
You have something
innate in you,

01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:15.210
ingrained in your
psyche and your soul

01:08:15.210 --> 01:08:17.050
for people that for
whatever reason,

01:08:17.050 --> 01:08:20.040
have had to move from
one place to another.

01:08:20.040 --> 01:08:22.384
And that's important.

01:08:25.189 --> 01:08:26.370
Somebody help us.

01:08:26.370 --> 01:08:30.660
It's a foundation-- you can
give to many foundations.

01:08:30.660 --> 01:08:35.630
But I started getting Santa
Claus mail-- you know,

01:08:35.630 --> 01:08:38.590
tons of mail.

01:08:38.590 --> 01:08:43.340
A kid in Ohio send
me his $1 allowance.

01:08:43.340 --> 01:08:48.029
A teacher-- a retired teacher
from Houston send me $25.

01:08:48.029 --> 01:08:52.370
And all over the United States--
places that I have never heard

01:08:52.370 --> 01:08:54.080
and will probably never visit--

01:08:54.080 --> 01:08:56.479
people would say,
Mayor, this is for you.

01:08:56.479 --> 01:08:57.920
Do with it what you may.

01:08:57.920 --> 01:09:00.470
So we had to set up a structure.

01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:05.210
I think we've raised
about $600,000.

01:09:05.210 --> 01:09:09.319
We've already used part of
that, because the structure

01:09:09.319 --> 01:09:14.590
of a foundation allows us to
use 25% outside of San Juan.

01:09:14.590 --> 01:09:17.120
And now we're in the
midst of finalizing

01:09:17.120 --> 01:09:21.950
the selection of homes in
San Juan where people have

01:09:21.950 --> 01:09:30.560
bedridden relatives or children
with disabilities or functional

01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:34.069
diversities that need to
be hooked up to something,

01:09:34.069 --> 01:09:37.010
or powered in order to live.

01:09:37.010 --> 01:09:39.800
So we're going to
provide those homes,

01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:42.260
fully equip them
with solar power

01:09:42.260 --> 01:09:45.229
so that they can run their
homes completely, and not

01:09:45.229 --> 01:09:49.819
be at risk of losing their
lives just because a huff

01:09:49.819 --> 01:09:56.150
and puff comes and the
electricity just leaves.

01:09:56.150 --> 01:09:59.685
It's called SomebodyHelpUs.org
or [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]..

01:10:02.580 --> 01:10:03.330
Hi.

01:10:03.330 --> 01:10:03.830
- Hi.

01:10:03.830 --> 01:10:06.580
I'm Marisa Rodriguez Garcia.

01:10:06.580 --> 01:10:08.630
I'm a native of Vega Baja.

01:10:08.630 --> 01:10:09.840
- [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

01:10:09.840 --> 01:10:14.710
- [NON ENGLISH SPEECH] And
a member of the diaspora.

01:10:14.710 --> 01:10:17.950
We felt a little bit of
the wind of Maria here,

01:10:17.950 --> 01:10:21.640
and that leads to two questions.

01:10:21.640 --> 01:10:25.540
One, is there anything you want
from the five million of us

01:10:25.540 --> 01:10:27.120
here?

01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:32.630
And number two, if we dream
of the future and something

01:10:32.630 --> 01:10:39.490
is finally coming our way
of your dream of real--

01:10:39.490 --> 01:10:43.120
- A process of
self-determination.

01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:47.560
- What will happen to the
five million of us here?

01:10:47.560 --> 01:10:49.595
Will you forget us?

01:10:49.595 --> 01:10:51.470
- Well, that's interesting
that you say that.

01:10:51.470 --> 01:10:54.470
And I have to tell
you that I think

01:10:54.470 --> 01:10:55.970
that one of the
things that happened

01:10:55.970 --> 01:10:59.630
is that there are
really no more you

01:10:59.630 --> 01:11:04.030
and us when it comes to the
Puerto Rican population.

01:11:04.030 --> 01:11:10.110
We're really one big
group divided by an ocean.

01:11:10.110 --> 01:11:16.210
Before, people in Puerto Rico
would say [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]..

01:11:16.210 --> 01:11:18.170
It was the diaspora
from Chicago that

01:11:18.170 --> 01:11:21.270
first took food to San Juan.

01:11:21.270 --> 01:11:23.810
It was the diaspora
through Hispanic Federation

01:11:23.810 --> 01:11:28.430
that gave us 270,000 pounds
of food that got there

01:11:28.430 --> 01:11:31.730
before FEMA's food got there.

01:11:31.730 --> 01:11:35.030
FEMA was giving us as food--

01:11:35.030 --> 01:11:37.460
and I remember watching
this box and saying,

01:11:37.460 --> 01:11:40.910
oh, God, there's
an entree in here.

01:11:40.910 --> 01:11:43.790
And it was beef jerky.

01:11:43.790 --> 01:11:49.670
Beef jerky, apple sauce, a
Babe Ruth, chocolate pudding,

01:11:49.670 --> 01:11:52.670
and a little can of Pringles.

01:11:52.670 --> 01:11:53.630
That was food.

01:11:56.510 --> 01:11:59.560
That was food.

01:11:59.560 --> 01:12:01.390
And when some of
us complained, they

01:12:01.390 --> 01:12:04.729
said, if you're
hungry you eat it.

01:12:04.729 --> 01:12:05.715
Well, that's true.

01:12:08.680 --> 01:12:10.720
That's true.

01:12:10.720 --> 01:12:13.240
But if you're a diabetic
and you eat that, you die.

01:12:16.640 --> 01:12:20.180
So the diaspora--

01:12:20.180 --> 01:12:24.470
Philip Levine that was Mayor
of Miami Beach at the time--

01:12:24.470 --> 01:12:30.680
Houston, California,
Boston, Chicago, New York,

01:12:30.680 --> 01:12:32.165
held us together.

01:12:36.130 --> 01:12:39.970
So you cannot forget
what is part of you.

01:12:39.970 --> 01:12:45.130
And you're a part of us
and we are a part of you.

01:12:45.130 --> 01:12:51.780
We will forever be linked by a
horrible situation that helped

01:12:51.780 --> 01:12:54.030
us find our way to each other.

01:12:56.680 --> 01:13:01.420
The question is, what can we
do together moving forward?

01:13:01.420 --> 01:13:05.670
Jossie Valentin that's
here with me is--

01:13:05.670 --> 01:13:08.480
or I'm here with her--

01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:11.840
she's a Mount Holyoke
City Councilor.

01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:15.300
She's part of a diaspora.

01:13:15.300 --> 01:13:17.760
I personally believe
then whatever

01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:19.740
happens in Puerto
Rico, the diaspora

01:13:19.740 --> 01:13:22.770
should have a vote in it.

01:13:22.770 --> 01:13:24.270
But I have to tell
you that's not

01:13:24.270 --> 01:13:28.150
shared by a lot of
people in Puerto Rico.

01:13:28.150 --> 01:13:32.100
So no, I will never forget you
because you saved the lives

01:13:32.100 --> 01:13:34.650
of the people that I love.

01:13:34.650 --> 01:13:40.150
And I learned that
I was mistaken

01:13:40.150 --> 01:13:43.470
when I called you them.

01:13:43.470 --> 01:13:45.050
I should have always
called you us.

01:13:48.459 --> 01:13:51.868
[APPLAUSE]

01:13:56.760 --> 01:14:01.280
- For her citizenship and for
a wonderful moment of education

01:14:01.280 --> 01:14:03.740
for all of us, let me
thank Mayor Cruz again.

01:14:03.740 --> 01:14:04.490
Thank you so much.

01:14:04.490 --> 01:14:04.990
[APPLAUSE]

01:14:04.990 --> 01:14:08.140
[MUSIC PLAYING]
