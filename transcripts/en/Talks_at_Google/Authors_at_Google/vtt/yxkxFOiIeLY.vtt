00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.940
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:10.250
TORRENCE BOONE: So thank you
for taking the time to join us,

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:12.060
and why don't we dive in?

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:16.550
You've written an
extraordinary book,

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:22.770
one that is both incredibly
personal, but at the same time

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.020
incredibly important in
terms of the gay rights

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:29.150
movement, human
rights in general,

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:31.775
diversity, all of
those dimensions.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.200
As a kicking off point,
why did you write it?

00:00:37.447 --> 00:00:38.780
JOHN BROWNE: Well, good morning.

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.990
I wrote it because someone
eventually persuaded me

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:47.810
by total persistence
that I should write it.

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:50.170
But I was thinking
about the book,

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:51.960
I thought it was
important to write

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.340
a book which did the
following things.

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:59.890
First, it stopped anyone getting
in the same mess as I got into.

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:01.720
It would be a
tragedy, in my view,

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.099
if someone repeated the
mistakes that I'd made.

00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:08.880
Secondly, to give people
a sense that there

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.550
are plenty of role models
out there, in business,

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.960
in corporate life, where they
could see some of themselves,

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.690
not all of themselves,
but role models

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:23.360
tend to give people confidence
to be themselves and for good

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.010
and for bad.

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:29.180
Thirdly, I wrote it
to write a letter

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.620
to all the straight
people in the world.

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:35.180
I wanted to write a
letter which said,

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.030
you've really got
to think about this.

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.490
And the straight people are
very important, the allies are

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.430
critical, because if we want
to make it possible for people

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.940
to be themselves in corporate
life, to be authentic,

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.110
then all the help comes
from straight people,

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.960
and that is most of the
leaders in business.

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.290
The fourth reason I wrote it
was a very simple observation.

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.830
I kept looking around for
role models, and I said,

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.865
there's got to be a
gay CEO somewhere.

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.310
And so I looked at
the S&amp;P 500, and I

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.150
saw there were no out gay CEOs.

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:15.925
So I then looked at
the rest of the list,

00:02:15.925 --> 00:02:21.460
and when I wrote the book,
you had to go down to S&amp;P 723

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:24.230
before you found an out gay CEO.

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.020
And I said, that's odd.

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.705
It's statistically improbable--

00:02:27.705 --> 00:02:29.645
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:29.645 --> 00:02:33.260
And I think that something's
wrong-- either people are

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.610
in the closet, or gay people
have been discriminated

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.660
against, or maybe gay
people have just opted out.

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.160
They haven't got
into the business

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.680
of wanting to go to
the top of a company.

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.697
And there were no role models.

00:02:46.697 --> 00:02:48.530
So I said, we got to
write it, and let's see

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:49.988
what happens after
I've written it.

00:02:50.457 --> 00:02:51.540
TORRENCE BOONE: Fantastic.

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:59.840
So take us back to May of
2007, which is in many ways

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.940
the kicking off
point of the book,

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:11.230
and that was the time when
the press made it explicit

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.300
that you are gay.

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:18.055
You were outed in a
very dramatic way.

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:23.530
Tell us about what was going
through your head, your heart,

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:30.730
during that time, and what
you describe as being somewhat

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.350
eaten alive by the media
vultures of the time.

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:35.330
Just take us back then.

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:38.140
JOHN BROWNE: Well,
the story starts

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.780
before May 1, 2007, which
was Labor Day-- I thought

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:46.067
I had a very interesting
and important moment to do

00:03:46.067 --> 00:03:48.150
something important-- but
we'll come back to that.

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:56.010
Because I'd become a figure
of a lot of public interest

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.170
during my time as
running BP-- BP

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:03.310
came from a very small company
to a very large company--

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.030
and it tried to do all sorts
of things rather differently.

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:11.060
And during that time, I
was always in the closet.

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:16.329
Actually I'd been in the closet
since I grew up in the '60s.

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:19.459
In the '60s, being
gay was effectively

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:23.170
a recipe for being
blackmailed or bullied,

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:26.520
because in most parts of
the world, including the UK,

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.620
it was illegal for people to
undertake a homosexual act.

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.190
So I stayed in the closet.

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:37.070
My late mother, who was
an Auschwitz survivor

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:40.250
always said to me, two rules
of life will preserve you.

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:43.060
Number one, never
tell anyone a secret,

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:44.930
because it's no longer a secret.

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:48.300
And number two, never be a
visible member of a minority,

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:53.035
because when the going gets
tough minorities always hurt,

00:04:53.035 --> 00:04:57.250
and from her point of view
that was exactly correct.

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:02.280
So this was drilled into me,
so I built a couple of lives.

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:03.370
I felt like James Bond.

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:04.720
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:10.870
I had a life which had
no sexuality in it,

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:14.560
and I had a gay life, and
I kept these very separate.

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:19.040
And as I got more
and more well known,

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:22.790
it was more and more difficult
to keep the two lives separate,

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:24.570
and actually to have a gay life.

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:29.370
So I decided to reduce
risk, and by reducing risk,

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:31.160
I increased risk gigantically.

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:34.100
I said the only way
I can meet someone

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:37.400
is through an escort
website, which I did.

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:43.820
And I built a relationship with
a guy who I met, it fell apart,

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:45.960
and I thought nothing of it.

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:49.790
And at the beginning of
2007, I got a phone call

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:52.470
from a well-known
newspaper, "Mail on Sunday,"

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:55.950
"The Daily Mail," which
said that they cover

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:58.470
this sort of thing,
and which said

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:01.490
we've bought a story from
your former boyfriend

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:06.620
about your entire life, and
we have the following 29 or 39

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:09.810
questions we'd like you to
answer-- Friday evening,

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:13.380
published on Sunday--
a classic trick.

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:16.020
So I decided that I'd
say, this is my life.

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:20.170
Why should someone
advertise my privacy?

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:23.610
So I stopped the
story being published

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:26.180
by taking out what's called
a super injunction with lots

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:28.055
of lawyers and all sorts
of things like that.

00:06:28.555 --> 00:06:31.280
And in so doing, I
made a fatal error.

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:33.840
Because I couldn't bring
myself to say where we'd met,

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:38.390
I lied on where we met, and I
corrected it a few days later,

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:39.630
but it was a very bad thing.

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:47.350
So this lawsuit carried
on, carried on, carried on.

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:48.725
I couldn't tell anyone about it.

00:06:48.725 --> 00:06:52.650
It would be Contempt of Court
if I did, and lo and behold

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:54.810
eventually I lost
my last appeal,

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:57.790
and I was told that the story
would come out on May 1.

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:03.480
So about that time I'd been
almost preparing myself

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:06.330
in some ways, but you can't
really prepare yourself,

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:10.600
to say that my life was
really about to change,

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:14.440
involuntary change, and so
everything would change.

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:17.900
So I resolved that I
would resign from BP,

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:20.050
because it was
embarrassing for BP,

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:22.490
and the board is
terribly conservative.

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:29.440
And so on May 1, I had a letter
delivered to my chairman,

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:33.990
resigning, and I walked out
of the front door of BP.

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:37.170
I walked out of BP
for the last time

00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:40.800
into a huge throng of press.

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:43.740
And when it was all over the
world, and for three days

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:49.630
I was hounded by paparazzi
on motorbikes and long lenses

00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:50.910
and stuff like that.

00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:53.110
So eventually that all
stopped, and I went away,

00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:55.607
and I thought about
my life and I said,

00:07:55.607 --> 00:07:57.690
absolutely everything has
to change, which it did.

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:01.410
So I stopped doing everything
I was doing, and said,

00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:02.870
let's start again.

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:05.460
And one of my wise
friends said, that'll

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:09.860
be fine because all this
nonsense with the press,

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:12.380
it is the dogs bark
and the caravan

00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:16.050
moves on, so you're no longer
a story, which was true.

00:08:16.565 --> 00:08:18.065
TORRENCE BOONE: So
one of the things

00:08:18.065 --> 00:08:21.330
that you do, I think,
incredibly well in the book

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:26.870
is to communicate that
sense of fear and anxiety

00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:30.700
as you were grappling
with all of these issues,

00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:34.070
and I think it's an
interesting perspective

00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:39.340
to share with the group the kind
of mental process happening,

00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:42.610
because you were
not actually even

00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:44.406
truthful to your
lawyer to some extent.

00:08:44.406 --> 00:08:45.280
JOHN BROWNE: Correct.

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:46.330
TORRENCE BOONE: Correct?

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:47.815
Was there anyone who knew?

00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:52.360
Was anyone looped into what
you were thinking, feeling?

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:54.040
JOHN BROWNE: Not really, no.

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:56.750
I kept it all to myself.

00:08:56.750 --> 00:09:00.615
In my head, I'd built a
whole structure of fears.

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:04.160
Fears that if I
came out, I wouldn't

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:08.460
be taken as seriously
as if I didn't come out.

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:10.930
Fears that I'd lose my friends.

00:09:10.930 --> 00:09:15.090
They'd cross the street
when I walked past them.

00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:19.500
Fears that people would
not do business with me,

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:23.845
that clients, suppliers, will
think I was rather trivial.

00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:28.030
And since I was in a very
geopolitical business,

00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:31.480
that all the heads of state
would say, you disgust me,

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:35.490
we don't want you, and
everything would fall apart.

00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:40.050
So I'd convinced myself
about this, and as a result,

00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:45.000
I protected the secret according
to my mother's instruction,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.610
tell nobody.

00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:52.030
So I did that, and of course,
when you debate with yourself

00:09:52.030 --> 00:09:55.890
with nobody else, you
rarely get the right answer.

00:09:55.890 --> 00:09:57.277
TORRENCE BOONE: [LAUGHING]

00:09:57.277 --> 00:09:58.985
JOHN BROWNE: Because
you're always right.

00:09:58.985 --> 00:10:00.186
TORRENCE BOONE: [LAUGHING]

00:10:00.186 --> 00:10:03.360
JOHN BROWNE: And so it's
difficult to get out

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:04.660
of this box of fears.

00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:09.350
And of course when it happened,
I realized that all of these

00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:11.335
were sheer and utter nonsense.

00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:14.690
It wasn't true that
I lost my friends.

00:10:14.690 --> 00:10:16.320
If anything, I made more.

00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:19.295
I didn't lose my
business contacts.

00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:22.910
They stayed the same.

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:28.790
I was thinking to myself maybe
after I publish this book,

00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:33.060
or after I came out, I would
be made persona non grata

00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:35.000
in some countries
in the world where

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.710
it's illegal to
promote homosexuality.

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:38.660
Not at all.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:46.340
So nothing changed, except I
changed a lot, because I now

00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:50.520
could be more of
myself, and I was better

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:53.360
at connecting with
people than I used to be.

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:59.350
One of my bosses from the
early days has a great wife.

00:10:59.350 --> 00:11:04.100
When we had dinner in
San Francisco recently,

00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:06.220
she said to me,
she said, I always

00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:09.310
knew there was
something up with you

00:11:09.310 --> 00:11:12.602
because you defined
the word reserved,

00:11:12.602 --> 00:11:13.560
even for an Englishman.

00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:15.650
TORRENCE BOONE: [LAUGHING]

00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:19.350
JOHN BROWNE: There was something
really deeply reserved,

00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:21.040
and that was right.

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:23.290
TORRENCE BOONE: And you talk
a lot about that as well,

00:11:23.290 --> 00:11:29.060
the liberating
notion of coming out,

00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:31.495
the burden of being
in the closet.

00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:39.590
So related, and your mother was
incredibly important to you.

00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:45.590
She was not with you during
the unfolding of a lot of this,

00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:50.300
but had clearly played
an important part

00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:53.650
as all mothers do, but she was
also your surrogate partner

00:11:53.650 --> 00:11:55.840
as well in that
she lived with you,

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:58.840
you went to a lot of events and
those sorts of things with her.

00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:05.140
What advise do you think
she would have given you?

00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:08.362
Or how would she reflect
on this whole thing?

00:12:08.362 --> 00:12:09.820
JOHN BROWNE: It's
impossible to say

00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:12.355
because this is, all
other things being equal,

00:12:12.355 --> 00:12:14.750
a hypothetical question.

00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:21.250
But people rarely
change deeply held views

00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:24.660
which form part of their
character, where they've

00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:28.630
come through something as
terrifying as the Holocaust.

00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:33.630
So I doubt very much whether
she changed her view that people

00:12:33.630 --> 00:12:37.300
aren't reliable with
secrets, you don't tell them,

00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:40.800
and just don't get in
the way of the majority

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:44.510
when something goes wrong,
because, in the words of one

00:12:44.510 --> 00:12:48.100
of my other friends,
advances with minorities

00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:51.150
always require
constant vigilance.

00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:55.030
It is not something you
can simply say, it's done.

00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:57.780
It's not done, and
she would say that.

00:12:59.122 --> 00:13:02.640
TORRENCE BOONE: But
also be happy, proud,

00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:05.340
that you've made it
to the other side.

00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:08.460
JOHN BROWNE: As a pragmatist, as
a practical person, of course.

00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:10.740
Of course, of course.

00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:12.700
TORRENCE BOONE:
So I actually want

00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:15.930
to go back to something
that you mentioned earlier,

00:13:15.930 --> 00:13:19.300
the notion of being a
spy, of a spy in training.

00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:22.250
There's a great quote
from the book where

00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:26.120
you say, "the longer I kept up
my charade, the more successful

00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:27.230
I became.

00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:29.680
At times I found my
double life thrilling,

00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:31.910
and I thought
conducting it somehow

00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:34.730
improved my skill
at sensing danger,

00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:36.910
as if I were a spy in training.

00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:40.640
I persuaded myself that this
was the right way to live."

00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:43.650
So how do you reflect on
this observation today?

00:13:43.650 --> 00:13:47.230
What lessons do you think it
provides gay professionals who

00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:49.610
are going through the
same types of issues?

00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:52.160
JOHN BROWNE: Well first,
I hope no one gets

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:57.646
into the same position of
having two lives like this.

00:13:57.646 --> 00:13:59.330
I hope that they can
bring them together

00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:01.450
because there's
such a hidden cost.

00:14:01.450 --> 00:14:04.040
But I think one of
the things it does

00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:11.740
is when you've got two lives,
you get very, flexible,

00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:17.070
you get very attuned at
reading danger and reading

00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:18.900
people very quickly.

00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:24.180
It's a skill which comes
just by observation

00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:26.900
of what they do after
you've met them,

00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:29.300
and then you go back
and correlate it

00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:35.680
to the first impression,
and you build this database

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:38.680
because it's a matter
of survival as opposed

00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:42.070
to a matter of luxury
or academic interest.

00:14:43.170 --> 00:14:46.340
So it teaches you
this, and it teaches

00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:50.030
you to be much more accurate
about sizing people up.

00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:53.200
You get it wrong sometimes,
but it does do that.

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:55.540
Now whether that is
a skill-- I'm always

00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:57.600
very reluctant to say
that there are skills that

00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:00.750
go with sectors--
it may or may not

00:15:00.750 --> 00:15:04.170
be a skill that
LGBT people have,

00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:09.220
but it's a skill that people
who are threatened certainly

00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:11.017
develop, certainly develop.

00:15:11.017 --> 00:15:12.600
TORRENCE BOONE: Well,
and also a skill

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:14.782
that can be very useful in
the context of business.

00:15:14.782 --> 00:15:15.740
JOHN BROWNE: It can be.

00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:17.948
TORRENCE BOONE: And you even
make reference to that--

00:15:17.948 --> 00:15:20.650
and many of the people
you interview-- the book

00:15:20.650 --> 00:15:24.680
is wonderful in that it
provides a pretty broad sweep

00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:29.410
of industries, business,
sports, law, and a number

00:15:29.410 --> 00:15:32.780
of very successful people, some
of whom are still in the closet

00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:34.822
despite the current context.

00:15:34.822 --> 00:15:35.530
JOHN BROWNE: Yes.

00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:39.807
They masquerade with
false names in the book.

00:15:39.807 --> 00:15:41.140
There aren't that many of those.

00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:43.960
TORRENCE BOONE: But they talk
about some of the advantages

00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:47.090
actually of having to
negotiate this double life

00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:50.600
and the potential
impact that it has

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:52.545
on their success
in the workplace.

00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:59.010
JOHN BROWNE: Yes, they all
would admit that they are not

00:15:59.010 --> 00:16:03.860
as engaged in what they're doing
as they might have been had

00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:07.930
they been able to be
themselves at work.

00:16:07.930 --> 00:16:10.820
And I think that's the
big point, the business

00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:15.350
point about why coming
out is good for business.

00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:18.820
Engaged teams always
perform better.

00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:20.960
There are tons of
studies which show that,

00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:27.300
and companies with engaged teams
have a premium out performance,

00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:28.810
compared with the average.

00:16:28.810 --> 00:16:29.600
It's enormous.

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:34.350
It's 2% a year over 20
years for the companies

00:16:34.350 --> 00:16:36.910
that genuinely
have engaged teams.

00:16:36.910 --> 00:16:41.500
And LGBT people feeling safe,
feeling safe to come out

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:46.280
and being part of a company
in its fullest sense,

00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:49.340
are a leading
indicator, a litmus test

00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:53.030
of how people are
engaged in the company.

00:16:54.362 --> 00:16:56.570
TORRENCE BOONE: And clearly
an important part of that

00:16:56.570 --> 00:17:02.160
is mentorship and role models,
which you led off with.

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:07.320
And it was curious you share a
story about Frank Rickwood, who

00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:10.650
was your boss here
in New York, and that

00:17:10.650 --> 00:17:13.270
was a pivotal point
in your career.

00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:17.290
This is an also closeted
gay professional,

00:17:17.290 --> 00:17:20.790
and again it's always hard
to live in hypotheticals,

00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:24.900
but I think that one of the
things gay professionals, those

00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:26.520
out and in the
closet, grapple with

00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:29.059
is some sense of
connectivity to people

00:17:29.059 --> 00:17:30.600
who are going through
the same thing.

00:17:31.630 --> 00:17:35.990
If you both had known
that you were gay,

00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:40.180
or if you project
to the challenges

00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:43.530
that people in a similar
situation confront today,

00:17:43.530 --> 00:17:47.240
how do you think that
dialogue would unfold?

00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:48.920
What are the
implications for actually

00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:52.610
having some sense of
a mentor or role model

00:17:52.610 --> 00:17:55.080
in your professional life?

00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:57.320
JOHN BROWNE: Role
models are crucial.

00:17:57.320 --> 00:18:01.910
When I was working
for Frank Rickwood,

00:18:01.910 --> 00:18:05.380
the last thing I would
have ever dreamt of doing

00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:07.990
would be to actually
make a connection.

00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:09.380
There was a gap of seniority.

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:15.490
Well, there was the gap
of fear that maybe I'd

00:18:15.490 --> 00:18:16.550
got it a bit wrong.

00:18:16.550 --> 00:18:17.900
I wasn't quite sure.

00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:20.710
What would happen
to this information?

00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:25.400
But today, things are
different in some environments,

00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:28.250
but role models
are most important

00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:32.450
because part of what they
provide other people is

00:18:32.450 --> 00:18:36.770
confidence that it's OK to be
out, that it's good to be out,

00:18:36.770 --> 00:18:39.660
that it doesn't get in the way
of promotion, that people do

00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:41.350
have a better life.

00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:44.210
And you can see it rather
than just read about it.

00:18:44.210 --> 00:18:48.910
You can actually see it
through some real person.

00:18:48.910 --> 00:18:50.310
That's important.

00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:53.700
That's why I believe
role models are essential

00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:57.320
and why so much of the book
talks about role models.

00:18:57.320 --> 00:19:01.950
When I was writing the book,
halfway through the book,

00:19:01.950 --> 00:19:05.150
I thought we might have
got to the point of being,

00:19:05.150 --> 00:19:10.095
if you will, post-gay, that
the book might no longer be

00:19:10.095 --> 00:19:10.595
relevant.

00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:16.250
And then I started meeting
a lot of professionals

00:19:16.250 --> 00:19:20.240
to be interviewed for the
book, between 25 and 35,

00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:24.690
and I was struck by the
number of those people who

00:19:24.690 --> 00:19:28.230
did not want to
come out at work.

00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:29.690
They really believe
that it would

00:19:29.690 --> 00:19:33.175
be a singular damaging event.

00:19:33.175 --> 00:19:37.360
It would prevent them
from being promoted.

00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:41.160
It would make them exposed
to potential bullying.

00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:42.640
It would make them weak.

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:45.500
And therefore, they
absolutely would not do it,

00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:48.640
and that's why there were
a lot of people who gave us

00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:53.220
interviews on the understanding
of confidentiality,

00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:54.480
and some were very extreme.

00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:56.000
When we read back
some interviews,

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:01.360
we read back an interview
to a man who we identified

00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:06.220
as a banker in London, and
he said, you can't say that.

00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:07.460
People may know who I am.

00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:08.830
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:08.830 --> 00:20:14.250
And it's extreme, but it's
part of a set of fears.

00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:16.700
TORRENCE BOONE: Yes.

00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:20.880
So after you came out, which
was this extraordinary event,

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:23.870
you received
thousands of letters.

00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:28.530
Can you share with
us just reflections

00:20:28.530 --> 00:20:32.243
on those letters, things that
were surprising, inspirational.

00:20:34.930 --> 00:20:36.640
JOHN BROWNE: A
lots of the letters

00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:40.080
came from straight
people who had

00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:43.470
got into a mess
with relationships,

00:20:43.470 --> 00:20:44.470
and they'd been exposed.

00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:49.100
They said to me this
is exactly the same.

00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:52.570
You just change he
to she, she to he,

00:20:52.570 --> 00:20:55.580
and the same
situations occurred,

00:20:55.580 --> 00:20:58.910
but we didn't get this
amount of press coverage

00:20:58.910 --> 00:21:00.940
because we're straight
and you're gay.

00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:05.670
And that was a very
important factor at the time.

00:21:05.670 --> 00:21:07.310
I have a feeling
it's still a factor.

00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:12.110
They wanted to share with
me their experiences,

00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:17.060
and to a person to share
with me the experience

00:21:17.060 --> 00:21:21.900
that after a period of time it
all got better, that there was

00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:23.530
something really
to look forward to.

00:21:25.490 --> 00:21:28.520
I had a lot of
people write to me

00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:32.470
who I'd been in business
with, who wanted to assure me

00:21:32.470 --> 00:21:36.300
that they want to carry on,
and they thought this was great

00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:40.250
and I'd have a good and full
life, including thousands

00:21:40.250 --> 00:21:42.390
and thousands of people
who worked in BP.

00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:46.670
In fact, I think over
10,000 instant emails,

00:21:46.670 --> 00:21:49.850
and in those days emails
were a little bit more

00:21:49.850 --> 00:21:52.350
clumsy than they are today.

00:21:52.350 --> 00:21:54.710
And then there were
a very few people

00:21:54.710 --> 00:21:57.570
who talked to me
in their letters

00:21:57.570 --> 00:22:02.610
about the tragedy that had
befallen them as they came out.

00:22:03.790 --> 00:22:07.720
People had been to jail
before the law changed, people

00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:11.620
whose lives have been
destroyed by other people,

00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:15.660
and it reminded me that not
everything works out well

00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:17.980
under any circumstances
for anything.

00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:22.620
While we should aspire
to make coming out

00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:25.170
a really great
event for everybody,

00:22:25.170 --> 00:22:28.340
it may not be for
everybody, and so it

00:22:28.340 --> 00:22:29.610
is an individual decision.

00:22:29.610 --> 00:22:33.800
But on balance, it's one
people should really do,

00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:37.060
because the risk reward
is in favor of coming out.

00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:38.480
TORRENCE BOONE: Yes, yes.

00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:41.570
So we're going to open
it up to the audience

00:22:41.570 --> 00:22:42.830
in just a few minutes.

00:22:42.830 --> 00:22:46.615
So if you guys have questions
and want to move to the mics,

00:22:46.615 --> 00:22:47.490
feel free to do that.

00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:56.520
Before we open it up, I
wanted to follow on that.

00:22:56.520 --> 00:23:00.320
You met your partner actually
shortly after this incident.

00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:02.140
Can you tell us
about that process?

00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:03.655
And now you're in a committed
relationship, right?

00:23:03.655 --> 00:23:04.715
JOHN BROWNE: It's
absolutely extraordinary.

00:23:04.715 --> 00:23:05.798
TORRENCE BOONE: [LAUGHING]

00:23:05.798 --> 00:23:08.460
JOHN BROWNE: So while
everything changed,

00:23:08.460 --> 00:23:11.530
and I changed my
job, changed all

00:23:11.530 --> 00:23:15.370
of the activities I was doing,
one thing that didn't change

00:23:15.370 --> 00:23:23.240
was the secrecy of my private
address for security reasons.

00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:28.210
So all the mail came
to my business address,

00:23:28.210 --> 00:23:34.900
and except for one letter
arrived at my private address

00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:38.850
from someone who said, I've
read everything about you.

00:23:38.850 --> 00:23:41.410
I'm so sorry this all happened.

00:23:41.410 --> 00:23:48.100
It's really unfair, and we
hope that it gets better

00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:48.780
in the future.

00:23:49.629 --> 00:23:51.420
Perhaps you'd like to
have a drink with me.

00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:52.700
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:52.700 --> 00:24:02.100
So I thought, so first, how
did this person get my address

00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:04.780
because nobody had my address.

00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:07.690
So I didn't know.

00:24:07.690 --> 00:24:11.270
So then I said, absolutely,
I'll have a drink with you,

00:24:11.270 --> 00:24:13.420
and I postponed it
three times because I

00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:15.840
was busy doing things.

00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:19.040
The fourth time,
amazingly, he said fine.

00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:23.050
We had a drink, and we
got to know each other,

00:24:23.050 --> 00:24:25.370
and one thing led
to another and we've

00:24:25.370 --> 00:24:27.220
been together for
over seven years now.

00:24:29.182 --> 00:24:30.390
Now how'd he get the address?

00:24:30.390 --> 00:24:31.681
That was the interesting thing.

00:24:31.681 --> 00:24:33.420
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:35.810
So he used to be a
banker, incidentally.

00:24:35.810 --> 00:24:37.920
He decided against
banking, and has now

00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:40.440
gone into the-- he was
very, very successful--

00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:42.380
gone into the restaurant
business instead.

00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:45.980
He likes being attached
to things with his hands.

00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:52.640
So he looked at photographs
in the newspapers,

00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:56.530
and it said that I
lived in Chelsea,

00:24:56.530 --> 00:24:59.800
and there was a photograph
outside my apartment building.

00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:04.650
The numbers were blurred
out for security reasons.

00:25:04.650 --> 00:25:06.150
Anyway he said, I
know exactly where

00:25:06.150 --> 00:25:08.030
this building is,
I've walked past it.

00:25:08.030 --> 00:25:09.160
TORRENCE BOONE: [LAUGHING]

00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:11.800
JOHN BROWNE: So he then
walked past it again,

00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:15.920
and he said, since the
doorbells have no names on,

00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:19.920
just numbers, he said, why
not just write a letter

00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:26.600
and if he's not there, it'll be
thrown away or returned to me.

00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:28.950
And so that's how it
happened, a little piece

00:25:28.950 --> 00:25:30.404
of investigative activity.

00:25:30.404 --> 00:25:31.320
TORRENCE BOONE: Right.

00:25:32.445 --> 00:25:33.320
Excellent, excellent.

00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:34.653
Yes, we have a question, please.

00:25:35.049 --> 00:25:37.090
AUDIENCE: First of all,
thank you for being here,

00:25:37.090 --> 00:25:38.650
and for writing this book.

00:25:38.650 --> 00:25:41.750
It's a really
important touch point

00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:44.327
and thing to
understand about what

00:25:44.327 --> 00:25:46.660
it means to bring your true
self and your authentic self

00:25:46.660 --> 00:25:49.170
to your work, so
thank you for that.

00:25:49.170 --> 00:25:52.780
I'm curious, at a
place like Google,

00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:55.344
I see people around me
coming out every day.

00:25:55.344 --> 00:25:57.010
And it's not that
they're in the closet,

00:25:57.010 --> 00:25:59.450
it's just that as you meet
new people in business

00:25:59.450 --> 00:26:01.680
and they ask you and get to
know you and they ask you

00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:04.480
about your life, you're
constantly coming out.

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:06.630
And Google is,
hopefully, one of those

00:26:06.630 --> 00:26:10.260
places where it's easier to
constantly be coming out,

00:26:10.260 --> 00:26:13.630
but I could see really
traditional corporate type

00:26:13.630 --> 00:26:20.080
jobs, finance, banking,
being in the law field,

00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:23.810
as more difficult places to
be constantly coming out,

00:26:23.810 --> 00:26:27.620
and maybe that's something that
keeps people in that closet.

00:26:27.620 --> 00:26:29.280
What kind of advice
would you have

00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:31.810
to people that are
faced with that

00:26:31.810 --> 00:26:37.270
and need to maybe figure out
a way to get over that hump

00:26:37.270 --> 00:26:40.650
and be their authentic self,
no matter how, to your point,

00:26:40.650 --> 00:26:43.310
conservative the
environment might be.

00:26:43.310 --> 00:26:44.810
JOHN BROWNE: Well,
I think if people

00:26:44.810 --> 00:26:48.010
feel unsafe about coming out,
they're not going to come out.

00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:53.830
And it's wrong to push them
in the face of what they

00:26:53.830 --> 00:26:57.450
may see as something
really dangerous to them.

00:27:00.110 --> 00:27:01.820
The right way to
answer this question

00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:05.300
is to go back and say, why
is it difficult to come out

00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:07.080
in some companies?

00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:08.520
And it has to start at the top.

00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:13.480
It's the tone set by the
leader and the follow

00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:15.990
up from the tone, the
measurement of the impact

00:27:15.990 --> 00:27:21.900
of the signal she or he is
giving, the time people attend

00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:25.210
to working on
inclusion of all sorts,

00:27:25.210 --> 00:27:27.690
especially LBGT
which is, I think,

00:27:27.690 --> 00:27:29.940
one of the more
difficult and the leading

00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:31.790
indicator of getting
inclusion right.

00:27:33.580 --> 00:27:36.010
And identifying role
models on the way,

00:27:36.010 --> 00:27:38.080
to make it possible for
you to identify better.

00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:43.520
If the environment
is very hostile,

00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:45.516
there is no choice
but to say, I'm either

00:27:45.516 --> 00:27:46.890
going to be in
the closet, or I'm

00:27:46.890 --> 00:27:49.310
going to find
somewhere else to work.

00:27:49.310 --> 00:27:51.410
And I think people do
go and find other places

00:27:51.410 --> 00:27:55.170
to work, when they find
themselves unsettled

00:27:55.170 --> 00:27:59.440
and in an area where they
see no solution but to not

00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:00.200
be themselves.

00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:02.890
Because everybody really
does want to be themselves,

00:28:02.890 --> 00:28:08.190
but they want to be themselves
and part of a society, not

00:28:08.190 --> 00:28:10.260
separate and an odd
thing in society.

00:28:11.557 --> 00:28:12.390
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:28:15.645 --> 00:28:16.580
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:19.640
So another question
relating to the idea of tone

00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:23.500
that you mentioned, a pretty
common example of someone who

00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:27.400
fits in this category would
be Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple.

00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:31.240
And he, in a lot of
situations has indirectly

00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:33.290
acknowledged his sexuality.

00:28:33.290 --> 00:28:37.730
He showed up at the Pride
March with Apple employees,

00:28:37.730 --> 00:28:40.300
but on some level, he's
still very unwilling

00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:41.430
to talk about it.

00:28:41.430 --> 00:28:43.410
It's in all of his
interview notes

00:28:43.410 --> 00:28:45.490
that it's not to be discussed.

00:28:45.490 --> 00:28:50.640
So, on one hand, what do you
think that says about the tone

00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:53.940
he's setting for the culture
at a place like Apple,

00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:57.020
and also for the
industry at large,

00:28:57.020 --> 00:29:02.140
just in terms of
acknowledging it on some level

00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:04.430
but not really putting it
on the table for discussion.

00:29:05.790 --> 00:29:07.500
JOHN BROWNE: I
don't know Mr. Cook.

00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:11.660
I knew his predecessor,
but I don't know Mr. Cook.

00:29:11.660 --> 00:29:12.530
So forgive me.

00:29:12.530 --> 00:29:15.620
I'm not going to comment on
him, but what I might comment on

00:29:15.620 --> 00:29:16.855
is leaders generally.

00:29:18.590 --> 00:29:23.460
It's possibly true that
for most people, coming out

00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:25.155
is a matter of personal choice.

00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:30.180
The sadness which
I feel about myself

00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:34.750
is that when you're a leader,
there isn't that choice.

00:29:34.750 --> 00:29:37.370
You've got to demonstrate
that you're authentic.

00:29:37.370 --> 00:29:39.080
You have to come out.

00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:41.670
Otherwise why
would anybody else?

00:29:41.670 --> 00:29:45.300
They feel it's not
quite on the agenda,

00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:47.290
so I think you
have to demonstrate

00:29:47.290 --> 00:29:49.570
by being authentic yourself.

00:29:49.570 --> 00:29:50.985
That is very important.

00:29:52.860 --> 00:29:55.590
I think the second
thing is that people

00:29:55.590 --> 00:29:57.195
have to come out several times.

00:29:58.220 --> 00:30:01.460
Obviously when
you're changing jobs,

00:30:01.460 --> 00:30:04.530
people discover your
sexuality again and again,

00:30:04.530 --> 00:30:08.050
or you might tell them as you
go from one company to the next.

00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:11.800
When people become
CEOs-- I've observed

00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:15.700
in the limited number of cases
where people have come out--

00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:19.190
they have to be
comfortable in their job

00:30:19.190 --> 00:30:21.970
that things are going
OK, and then they'll

00:30:21.970 --> 00:30:24.725
come out again in
the position of CEO.

00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:28.660
It's not an immediate reaction.

00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:32.500
So it's a progress of
coming out, but in the end

00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:36.210
it's really important
to have the biggest role

00:30:36.210 --> 00:30:38.490
models available.

00:30:38.490 --> 00:30:42.910
I'm the most senior
business person ever

00:30:42.910 --> 00:30:45.725
to be identified
as gay, I believe,

00:30:45.725 --> 00:30:50.920
and this is not a
description I want

00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:54.090
to have for very much longer.

00:30:54.090 --> 00:30:58.650
I'd much prefer someone who's
running a big company today

00:30:58.650 --> 00:31:01.695
to be out and be
a big role model.

00:31:03.137 --> 00:31:03.970
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:31:03.970 --> 00:31:06.760
And would you also
add that same sort

00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:10.230
of sense of
obligation and setting

00:31:10.230 --> 00:31:13.682
the tone applies for people
in the political world?

00:31:13.682 --> 00:31:14.390
JOHN BROWNE: Yes.

00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:17.820
Politicians are doing OK.

00:31:17.820 --> 00:31:19.860
More and more politicians
are coming out.

00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:23.790
The cynic would say
it's dangerous for them

00:31:23.790 --> 00:31:26.630
not to, because their
authenticity would

00:31:26.630 --> 00:31:30.940
be questioned, they'll be
pilloried in the press,

00:31:30.940 --> 00:31:34.190
but people feel comfortable
coming out today,

00:31:34.190 --> 00:31:40.480
and voters seem to be
accepting of sexuality as a non

00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:46.874
issue in many, many parts
of Europe and the USA.

00:31:46.874 --> 00:31:48.326
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:31:48.326 --> 00:31:49.780
TORRENCE BOONE: Yes.

00:31:49.780 --> 00:31:52.610
AUDIENCE: So Google is one
of these young, progressive

00:31:52.610 --> 00:31:53.400
companies.

00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:56.990
We have rainbow flags everywhere
from the sign on our building

00:31:56.990 --> 00:32:01.002
to our Olympic doodles to hidden
in our spreadsheet application,

00:32:01.002 --> 00:32:04.400
and we participate
in the parade.

00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:06.465
We have clubs, t-shirts.

00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:09.850
Does that mean, are we good?

00:32:09.850 --> 00:32:12.440
Do we just wait for the rest
of the world to catch up?

00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:14.990
It feels on some level
like there's so much more

00:32:14.990 --> 00:32:18.480
that we could be
doing to advance

00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:21.262
the normalization of
people of all identities

00:32:21.262 --> 00:32:21.970
and orientations.

00:32:25.710 --> 00:32:27.730
JOHN BROWNE: There
have to be many things.

00:32:27.730 --> 00:32:31.140
First, being there,
and demonstrating

00:32:31.140 --> 00:32:36.820
that you run a company which
has no barriers to inclusion.

00:32:36.820 --> 00:32:42.070
So people can be themselves
is an important point.

00:32:42.070 --> 00:32:46.840
It seems to me just being there
is important, but there's more.

00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:50.970
People can talk about what it's
like to be in an environment

00:32:50.970 --> 00:32:55.050
where you can be
yourself without fear.

00:32:55.050 --> 00:32:56.310
You can talk to suppliers.

00:32:57.670 --> 00:33:02.140
Suppliers need to
have the same value

00:33:02.140 --> 00:33:05.560
set, the same
practices as Google.

00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:08.110
Google can influence them.

00:33:08.110 --> 00:33:13.990
Google can influence by
economic nudging countries

00:33:13.990 --> 00:33:15.690
that it works in.

00:33:15.690 --> 00:33:19.600
It's not always
successful, but I always

00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:22.090
found that CEOs were
given a big list of

00:33:22.090 --> 00:33:26.240
to do's, like clean up the
environment, fix human rights,

00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:28.600
make sure that
everyone gets a job,

00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:33.480
increase growth and increase
value, do all of the above

00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:34.105
simultaneously.

00:33:35.250 --> 00:33:38.170
But actually, you do
bits at different times,

00:33:38.170 --> 00:33:43.190
and when you meet people
who run countries or are

00:33:43.190 --> 00:33:46.010
influential in a country,
you can say, well of course,

00:33:46.010 --> 00:33:49.400
I'm putting a gay leader here.

00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:52.270
They're very good, and
I want you to know that,

00:33:52.270 --> 00:33:55.790
and if I can't, then
I might not be here.

00:33:55.790 --> 00:34:01.160
So a little push here and there
from substantial corporations

00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:05.550
is very powerful because
they can't be ignored.

00:34:05.550 --> 00:34:07.480
Governments, of course,
can sanction and do

00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:12.080
things they rarely
do, but corporations

00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:13.820
can do bit by bit pushing.

00:34:17.303 --> 00:34:18.719
AUDIENCE: It
resonated for me when

00:34:18.719 --> 00:34:21.247
you were speaking before
about the experience of being

00:34:21.247 --> 00:34:23.330
in the closet and that
teaches you certain things,

00:34:23.330 --> 00:34:28.460
in terms of being circumspect
and gauging situations, just

00:34:28.460 --> 00:34:30.900
being trained to do that
as part of your normal life

00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:32.980
and how that can be
advantageous in business.

00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:37.870
Sometimes I say to
myself, hey Chris,

00:34:37.870 --> 00:34:40.289
you don't have to be that
way anymore in business.

00:34:41.489 --> 00:34:43.940
I wonder, have you had
any similar experiences,

00:34:43.940 --> 00:34:47.460
where you had ways of being
which you learned where you

00:34:47.460 --> 00:34:50.739
realized for yourself this
is actually disadvantageous

00:34:50.739 --> 00:34:51.825
now in business?

00:34:53.340 --> 00:34:54.465
JOHN BROWNE: Good question.

00:34:55.840 --> 00:34:59.220
With no real clear
answer, I believe

00:34:59.220 --> 00:35:02.410
what I do is
discipline myself not

00:35:02.410 --> 00:35:05.770
to behave in a way which
dissembles about me.

00:35:08.460 --> 00:35:14.797
I will not, in all cases, use it
as the opening line and neither

00:35:14.797 --> 00:35:15.380
would anybody.

00:35:17.210 --> 00:35:19.195
But when someone says,
do you have a wife?

00:35:19.195 --> 00:35:22.750
I say no, I have a male partner.

00:35:24.030 --> 00:35:24.980
I'm clear about it.

00:35:24.980 --> 00:35:28.710
I don't avoid
questions, and that

00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:31.660
is something which is
very important to me.

00:35:33.010 --> 00:35:36.050
I still read people.

00:35:36.050 --> 00:35:39.490
I still think about what is
the right way to negotiate.

00:35:41.020 --> 00:35:46.607
I still try and never give any
signal about what I'm thinking.

00:35:46.607 --> 00:35:47.690
TORRENCE BOONE: [LAUGHING]

00:35:47.690 --> 00:35:50.077
JOHN BROWNE: It's a
skill in negotiation.

00:35:50.077 --> 00:35:51.160
TORRENCE BOONE: And poker.

00:35:51.160 --> 00:35:53.620
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:53.620 --> 00:35:57.570
So I do all of those things,
because they're good things,

00:35:57.570 --> 00:36:00.212
but what I don't do is
dissemble about myself.

00:36:00.212 --> 00:36:01.045
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:36:04.337 --> 00:36:05.420
TORRENCE BOONE: Yes, Lisa.

00:36:06.105 --> 00:36:07.480
AUDIENCE: Hi, and
I want to thank

00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:09.365
you so much for being here.

00:36:09.365 --> 00:36:10.990
This is such an
interesting discussion.

00:36:12.350 --> 00:36:16.550
Recently during Pride Week,
Kim Stolz came to speak here,

00:36:16.550 --> 00:36:20.970
and she got a question
about being a out queer

00:36:20.970 --> 00:36:22.750
woman in the corporate world.

00:36:22.750 --> 00:36:26.310
She is most famously a former
contestant on "America's Next

00:36:26.310 --> 00:36:29.250
Top Model," less
famously a VP of Equity

00:36:29.250 --> 00:36:31.270
of Derivatives Trading
at Credit Suisse.

00:36:31.270 --> 00:36:36.400
And her argument is that
actually being out and queer

00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:40.050
in finance had actually
only benefited her

00:36:40.050 --> 00:36:43.080
because at this point so
many large corporations are

00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:46.030
so desperate for
diversity, particularly

00:36:46.030 --> 00:36:48.330
the financial
sphere, that she is

00:36:48.330 --> 00:36:52.680
a very valued member of her
team and an interesting bastion

00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:55.870
and symbol of a new
age of business.

00:36:55.870 --> 00:36:58.774
I'm just wondering what your
reaction is to that because I

00:36:58.774 --> 00:37:00.190
feel like a lot
of this discussion

00:37:00.190 --> 00:37:03.610
is about the more negative
side of coming out,

00:37:03.610 --> 00:37:05.651
the fact that it's
a personal decision,

00:37:05.651 --> 00:37:07.900
and I was interested to hear
from her that she thought

00:37:07.900 --> 00:37:10.020
it was only positive
and the future is going

00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:13.209
to move towards it actually
being a point of empowerment

00:37:13.209 --> 00:37:14.000
for some employees.

00:37:15.420 --> 00:37:17.860
JOHN BROWNE: If I've said
this is all negative,

00:37:17.860 --> 00:37:19.720
don't believe me.

00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:23.230
I believe it's a very
important and powerful thing

00:37:23.230 --> 00:37:26.880
to come out because you're just
going to be a better person.

00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:28.850
You're going to be
more relaxed, you're

00:37:28.850 --> 00:37:32.620
going to use your mind and your
skill on what you're doing,

00:37:32.620 --> 00:37:37.240
rather than half of it figuring
out how not to be who you are,

00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:38.150
which is complicated.

00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:47.812
With inclusion comes a very high
standard of merit, I believe.

00:37:47.812 --> 00:37:52.360
If that doesn't work,
then the whole idea

00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:56.795
of including people on an
equal basis begins to corrode.

00:37:58.080 --> 00:38:01.590
I want to make sure, at
least from my point of view,

00:38:01.590 --> 00:38:03.860
that people get jobs
because they're qualified

00:38:03.860 --> 00:38:08.040
to do that as I'm sure,
incidentally, she is,

00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:11.675
but It's not about
their sexuality.

00:38:12.710 --> 00:38:16.004
We don't have quotas for
sexuality, I don't believe,

00:38:16.004 --> 00:38:16.920
and neither should we.

00:38:19.170 --> 00:38:20.182
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:38:20.182 --> 00:38:22.390
I was just interested to
hear your reaction because I

00:38:22.390 --> 00:38:24.810
myself had a somewhat
similar reaction.

00:38:24.810 --> 00:38:28.581
I don't love thinking of myself
as a diversity hire, someone

00:38:28.581 --> 00:38:30.330
who's filling a box,
but at the same time,

00:38:30.330 --> 00:38:32.440
I was like, you know what,
take what you can get.

00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:34.150
It's kind of empowering
in a strange way.

00:38:34.150 --> 00:38:35.700
JOHN BROWNE: Well,
it's true, but I

00:38:35.700 --> 00:38:38.220
would say, but remember
the consequences

00:38:38.220 --> 00:38:39.597
of taking what you can get.

00:38:39.597 --> 00:38:40.430
AUDIENCE: Very true.

00:38:40.430 --> 00:38:41.357
Thank you.

00:38:41.357 --> 00:38:43.440
TORRENCE BOONE: And that's
actually a great segue.

00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:45.450
Part of the title of your
book is why coming out

00:38:45.450 --> 00:38:46.325
is good for business.

00:38:47.270 --> 00:38:50.510
You devote a chapter
to that question.

00:38:50.510 --> 00:38:52.510
Obviously, there are
themes throughout the book.

00:38:52.510 --> 00:38:54.470
Give us the synopsis
of your thinking

00:38:54.470 --> 00:38:57.080
on why it is good for business.

00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:00.730
JOHN BROWNE: First,
when businesses

00:39:00.730 --> 00:39:05.260
do the right thing, usually
they're pretty good businesses.

00:39:05.260 --> 00:39:08.040
So when they have
values that make sense,

00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:11.270
chances are they've got a
lot of other things going

00:39:11.270 --> 00:39:16.080
for them that give them a
greater chance of success.

00:39:17.510 --> 00:39:24.180
Secondly, engaged staff,
engaged teams, are better teams.

00:39:24.180 --> 00:39:26.755
They're not wandering
around saying,

00:39:26.755 --> 00:39:28.630
I wish I ought to think
about something else,

00:39:28.630 --> 00:39:30.330
I've got to think about myself.

00:39:30.330 --> 00:39:33.270
I'm going to be
engaged with the team,

00:39:33.270 --> 00:39:35.475
and engagement takes many forms.

00:39:37.020 --> 00:39:38.430
When you work with
people, you do

00:39:38.430 --> 00:39:40.830
have to know a little
bit about them.

00:39:40.830 --> 00:39:42.469
We are not machines.

00:39:42.469 --> 00:39:44.260
At least I don't think
we are machines yet.

00:39:44.260 --> 00:39:46.635
TORRENCE BOONE: [LAUGHING]
We're working on that actually

00:39:46.635 --> 00:39:47.650
here at Google.

00:39:47.650 --> 00:39:48.330
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:48.330 --> 00:39:49.390
JOHN BROWNE: Well,
I'll just check.

00:39:49.390 --> 00:39:50.270
That's why I thought I'd ask it.

00:39:50.270 --> 00:39:50.710
TORRENCE BOONE: [LAUGHING]

00:39:50.710 --> 00:39:52.210
JOHN BROWNE: So
there is an empathy,

00:39:52.210 --> 00:39:55.270
which has to be built up
in a high performance team,

00:39:55.270 --> 00:39:59.670
and by being out, you
can be more engaged.

00:39:59.670 --> 00:40:03.540
Thirdly, the numbers show it.

00:40:03.540 --> 00:40:05.470
I'm very struck by
all these studies

00:40:05.470 --> 00:40:11.520
which show hugely different
returns, much better returns,

00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:13.300
when you have engaged staff.

00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:17.920
That of course, covers
everything, from gender,

00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:19.780
race, all sorts of things.

00:40:19.780 --> 00:40:24.710
But actually LGBT is one
of those litmus tests

00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:26.700
which says, if you get
that right, chances

00:40:26.700 --> 00:40:29.870
are a lot of things are
going to fall in place,

00:40:29.870 --> 00:40:33.874
if you really work on this
particular more complex area.

00:40:33.874 --> 00:40:35.290
TORRENCE BOONE:
Yeah, well there's

00:40:35.290 --> 00:40:38.089
that great example in the book
where there's a career fair.

00:40:38.089 --> 00:40:39.130
JOHN BROWNE: Career fair.

00:40:39.130 --> 00:40:41.540
TORRENCE BOONE: And it's
an LGBT career fair.

00:40:41.540 --> 00:40:47.950
And there are all of these Asian
women coming up and getting

00:40:47.950 --> 00:40:52.620
information on the actual
environment or whatever,

00:40:52.620 --> 00:40:56.570
and the recruiters
were just baffled,

00:40:56.570 --> 00:41:00.060
because they were like, all
of these people cannot be gay.

00:41:00.060 --> 00:41:01.080
[LAUGHING]

00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:04.090
It's statistically
impossible, and it turned out

00:41:04.090 --> 00:41:06.746
that they were interested
in this company-- I

00:41:06.746 --> 00:41:08.870
forget the company-- but
they were interested in it

00:41:08.870 --> 00:41:11.600
because they said,
if you figured out

00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:14.960
how to deal with LGBT
issues, then in terms

00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:19.040
of any other diversity
metric, be it race or gender,

00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:21.810
you absolutely are
on the cutting edge.

00:41:21.810 --> 00:41:25.065
So I thought that was a pretty
interesting observation.

00:41:26.090 --> 00:41:30.405
JOHN BROWNE: It's one which
I believe holds water, too.

00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:36.050
When you have to think about
inclusion as something which

00:41:36.050 --> 00:41:39.000
is on everybody's
agenda, you change

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:42.070
the way a firm is
lead and managed.

00:41:43.270 --> 00:41:47.160
I've lead lots of teams,
and when you say to a team,

00:41:47.160 --> 00:41:50.900
well, we're going to
do something, something

00:41:50.900 --> 00:41:54.720
new and more, most
managers come back to you

00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:59.550
and say, now you've given me
88 things to do, the 89th,

00:41:59.550 --> 00:42:01.040
where does that go?

00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:02.700
What do you do with it?

00:42:02.700 --> 00:42:04.980
And here's where you
need to work hard.

00:42:04.980 --> 00:42:08.240
You need to create the
time and space for people

00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:11.340
to work on the
area of inclusion,

00:42:11.340 --> 00:42:13.945
especially with LGBT activity.

00:42:15.410 --> 00:42:19.310
And I always say to
people, most CEOs

00:42:19.310 --> 00:42:22.860
say that people are the
most important assets

00:42:22.860 --> 00:42:25.700
in the company, and
if that's the case,

00:42:25.700 --> 00:42:30.200
then they should be spending
their most important time

00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:34.340
on people, which would
normally mean, let's say,

00:42:34.340 --> 00:42:36.890
half their time on people.

00:42:36.890 --> 00:42:39.310
Most people don't do that.

00:42:39.310 --> 00:42:41.240
Maybe they should,
and that would

00:42:41.240 --> 00:42:43.280
make things very much better.

00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:44.655
TORRENCE BOONE:
Yeah, and I think

00:42:44.655 --> 00:42:46.870
there's an amazing insight
for me from the book--

00:42:46.870 --> 00:42:48.710
we talk a lot about
diversity-- we do that

00:42:48.710 --> 00:42:53.570
a lot here at Google-- but you
make the very clear distinction

00:42:53.570 --> 00:42:55.860
between diversity and inclusion.

00:42:55.860 --> 00:42:58.060
So you can have an amazing
amount of diversity,

00:42:58.060 --> 00:43:01.550
but if you don't have a dynamic
and a commitment to inclusion,

00:43:01.550 --> 00:43:02.672
it's almost for naught.

00:43:02.672 --> 00:43:03.755
JOHN BROWNE: That's right.

00:43:03.755 --> 00:43:04.930
That's right.

00:43:04.930 --> 00:43:06.810
The operative part is inclusion.

00:43:07.859 --> 00:43:08.900
The outcome is diversity.

00:43:10.790 --> 00:43:16.080
TORRENCE BOONE: So there is
a final question that I have,

00:43:16.080 --> 00:43:18.660
but before I get to that,
we'll take another one

00:43:18.660 --> 00:43:19.720
from the floor.

00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:20.305
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:43:20.305 --> 00:43:21.805
I was wondering if
you can talk more

00:43:21.805 --> 00:43:24.150
about coming out to your
family because I've actually

00:43:24.150 --> 00:43:26.800
found coming out at
work the easiest part.

00:43:30.180 --> 00:43:31.920
JOHN BROWNE: So I
failed to do it.

00:43:33.370 --> 00:43:37.830
I tried, and I realized
that I was coming up

00:43:37.830 --> 00:43:43.600
with my mother against these
key principles of a secret

00:43:43.600 --> 00:43:46.350
is a secret you
keep to yourself,

00:43:46.350 --> 00:43:48.350
don't become a part
of the minority.

00:43:48.350 --> 00:43:49.900
She really didn't want to hear.

00:43:50.930 --> 00:43:52.350
Did she know?

00:43:52.350 --> 00:43:54.820
She was smart enough to
have figured it all out.

00:43:54.820 --> 00:43:55.690
She must have done.

00:43:55.690 --> 00:43:56.106
AUDIENCE: They always do that.

00:43:56.106 --> 00:43:56.462
TORRENCE BOONE:
Mothers always know.

00:43:57.331 --> 00:43:58.580
JOHN BROWNE: They always know.

00:43:58.580 --> 00:43:59.535
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:59.535 --> 00:44:03.530
And my father died when
I was really quite young,

00:44:03.530 --> 00:44:07.830
so it was not a topic
we talked about.

00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:17.400
Interestingly, I've met a few
but rather surprising parents

00:44:17.400 --> 00:44:20.190
while I've been
talking about my book.

00:44:20.190 --> 00:44:26.270
Only last week, I was in
Henley on Thames in the UK

00:44:26.270 --> 00:44:30.510
at a book fair, a very
conservative, rather nice part

00:44:30.510 --> 00:44:39.910
of the UK, and I had two set of
middle-aged couples come to me

00:44:39.910 --> 00:44:43.800
and said, could you sign
this book to our son?

00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:45.850
We'd like him to come out.

00:44:45.850 --> 00:44:52.120
And I thought that was an
extraordinary reversal of role.

00:44:54.337 --> 00:44:55.170
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:44:55.739 --> 00:44:58.280
TORRENCE BOONE: That speaks to
the power of what you've done.

00:44:58.280 --> 00:45:04.410
So you also do an amazing job
of framing all of the dynamics

00:45:04.410 --> 00:45:09.020
around gay rights around
the world, from the US,

00:45:09.020 --> 00:45:14.100
to Uganda, to Russia,
to all sorts of places

00:45:14.100 --> 00:45:17.310
around the world,
and you provide

00:45:17.310 --> 00:45:19.700
a really interesting and
provocative point of view

00:45:19.700 --> 00:45:24.640
around the tension that
exists between the progressive

00:45:24.640 --> 00:45:27.490
experience that we have
in a place like the US

00:45:27.490 --> 00:45:29.840
and the subculture of
a place like Google,

00:45:29.840 --> 00:45:32.440
compared to other places
in the world where

00:45:32.440 --> 00:45:34.560
there's a lot more work to do.

00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:37.290
What is your projection
for the future?

00:45:37.290 --> 00:45:38.872
In general, my
take from the book

00:45:38.872 --> 00:45:40.580
is that you're very
optimistic, but given

00:45:40.580 --> 00:45:42.760
all of these
challenges that we have

00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:44.330
around the world
and the vigilance

00:45:44.330 --> 00:45:47.990
that we need to
hang on to, what's

00:45:47.990 --> 00:45:52.159
your projection 10 years
out for gay rights?

00:45:52.159 --> 00:45:53.450
How should we think about that?

00:45:53.450 --> 00:45:57.055
What can we individually
do to continue the charge?

00:45:58.400 --> 00:46:00.580
JOHN BROWNE: I'm
optimistic, even sometimes

00:46:00.580 --> 00:46:02.930
in the face of data
which should make

00:46:02.930 --> 00:46:05.450
me pessimistic in this area.

00:46:06.780 --> 00:46:13.230
Half the nations where being
gay or promoting homosexuality,

00:46:13.230 --> 00:46:16.480
doing a gay act is illegal,
were former members

00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:18.160
of the British Empire.

00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:20.640
I guess we exported
the laws, and we

00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:21.977
failed to export the update.

00:46:21.977 --> 00:46:23.060
TORRENCE BOONE: [LAUGHING]

00:46:23.060 --> 00:46:28.030
JOHN BROWNE: So they're stuck
with these laws of the past,

00:46:28.030 --> 00:46:30.570
and they're in
one category where

00:46:30.570 --> 00:46:33.560
they can be worked
on bit by bit,

00:46:33.560 --> 00:46:37.030
and many people are trying to
do that to change these laws.

00:46:37.030 --> 00:46:41.210
There are others
where it is partly

00:46:41.210 --> 00:46:46.140
an economic war on a
minority, partly it's

00:46:46.140 --> 00:46:51.090
to gain popular
votes, and those areas

00:46:51.090 --> 00:46:56.110
need economic pressure, slow
but gentle economic pressure.

00:46:56.110 --> 00:46:57.330
It's not just business.

00:46:57.330 --> 00:46:58.250
It's the World Bank.

00:46:58.250 --> 00:46:58.749
It's IMF.

00:46:58.749 --> 00:47:00.940
It's the lending arrangements.

00:47:00.940 --> 00:47:03.680
It's all part of a
package of human rights,

00:47:03.680 --> 00:47:07.240
and LGBT rights
are human rights.

00:47:07.240 --> 00:47:10.240
They are, and they need
to be in the same category

00:47:10.240 --> 00:47:13.430
as the general suite
of human rights.

00:47:13.430 --> 00:47:15.930
So we should rely
on people and push

00:47:15.930 --> 00:47:20.960
them to maintain vigilance,
to do something about it.

00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:22.910
I suppose one of
the big problems

00:47:22.910 --> 00:47:26.100
is-- and I've worked
in many countries--

00:47:26.100 --> 00:47:30.540
where in a variety of
areas laws are in place,

00:47:30.540 --> 00:47:32.160
and they're enforced
selectively.

00:47:33.650 --> 00:47:36.660
This puts everybody on
edge, whether that's

00:47:36.660 --> 00:47:41.335
on environmental matters,
financial matters, or LGBT.

00:47:42.350 --> 00:47:45.370
And that is the most
dangerous position to be in.

00:47:45.370 --> 00:47:48.990
No one is sure, in that
case, what is going on.

00:47:48.990 --> 00:47:51.660
Or where the laws have been
in place and in abeyance,

00:47:51.660 --> 00:47:55.780
and they suddenly come
back for enforcement

00:47:55.780 --> 00:48:00.750
which is the case in one or
two parts of the Far East.

00:48:00.750 --> 00:48:04.120
So pressure, I believe
things will change

00:48:04.120 --> 00:48:08.000
as the community of nations gets
closer, people keep traveling,

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:10.140
ideas keep exchanging.

00:48:10.140 --> 00:48:12.030
These things have a
habit of ironing out.

00:48:12.030 --> 00:48:14.690
The problem is how long will
it take, and that I don't know.

00:48:16.040 --> 00:48:18.540
TORRENCE BOONE: Please join me
in thanking Lord John Browne.

00:48:18.540 --> 00:48:21.590
[APPLAUSE]
