00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:15.960
When I was in the sixth grade,
I got into a fight at school.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.136
It wasn't the first time
I'd been in a fight,

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.640
but it was the first time
one happened at school.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.856
It was with a boy who was
about a foot taller than me,

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.816
who was physically stronger than me

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.080
and who'd been taunting me for weeks.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.816
One day in PE, he stepped on my shoe
and refused to apologize.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.296
So, filled with anger, I grabbed him
and I threw him to the ground.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.056
I'd had some previous judo training.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.960
(Laughter)

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.936
Our fight lasted less than two minutes,

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.216
but it was a perfect
reflection of the hurricane

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.136
that was building inside of me

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.216
as a young survivor of sexual assault

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.616
and as a girl who was grappling
with abandonment

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.736
and exposure to violence
in other spaces in my life.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.296
I was fighting him,

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.136
but I was also fighting the men
and boys that had assaulted my body

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.360
and the culture that told me
I had to be silent about it.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.816
A teacher broke up the fight

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.376
and my principal called me in her office.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.880
But she didn't say,
"Monique, what's wrong with you?"

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.616
She gave me a moment to collect my breath

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.600
and asked, "What happened?"

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.416
The educators working with me
led with empathy.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:30.656
They knew me.

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.976
They knew I loved to read,
they knew I loved to draw,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.800
they knew I adored Prince.

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.856
And they used that information
to help me understand

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.696
why my actions, and those
of my classmate, were disruptive

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.800
to the learning community
they were leading.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.296
They didn't place me on suspension;

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:49.880
they didn't call the police.

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.400
My fight didn't keep me
from going to school the next day.

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.920
It didn't keep me from graduating;
it didn't keep me from teaching.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.936
But unfortunately, that's not a story
that's shared by many black girls

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.760
in the US and around the world today.

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.016
We're living through a crisis
in which black girls

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:11.776
are being disproportionately pushed
away from schools ---

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.376
not because of an imminent threat
they pose to the safety of a school,

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.576
but because they're often
experiencing schools

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.400
as locations for punishment
and marginalization.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.656
That's something that I hear
from black girls around the country.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.656
But it's not insurmountable.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.240
We can shift this narrative.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.280
Let's start with some data.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.456
According to a National Black Women's
Justice Institute analysis

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:37.696
of civil rights data

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.696
collected by the US
Department of Education,

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.696
black girls are the only group of girls
who are overrepresented

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.160
along the entire continuum
of discipline in schools.

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.456
That doesn't mean that other girls aren't
experiencing exclusionary discipline

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.096
and it doesn't mean that other girls
aren't overrepresented

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.416
at other parts along that continuum.

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.456
But black girls
are the only group of girls

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.480
who are overrepresented all along the way.

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:07.096
Black girls are seven times more likely
than their white counterparts

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.816
to experience one or more
out-of-school suspensions

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.936
and they're nearly three times more likely
than their white and Latinx counterparts

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.000
to be referred to the juvenile court.

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.696
A recent study by the Georgetown
Center on Poverty and Inequality

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.856
partially explained
why this disparity is taking place

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.136
when they confirmed
that black girls experience

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.536
a specific type of age compression,

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.680
where they're seen as more adult-like
than their white peers.

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.656
Among other things, the study found

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.736
that people perceive black girls
to need less nurturing,

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.776
less protection, to know more about sex

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.800
and to be more independent
than their white peers.

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:47.816
The study also found

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:53.576
that the perception disparity begins
when girls are as young as five years old.

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:57.816
And that this perception
and the disparity increases over time

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.920
and peaks when girls are
between the ages of 10 and 14.

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.720
This is not without consequence.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.456
Believing that a girl is older than she is
can lead to harsher treatment,

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.096
immediate censure when she makes a mistake

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.280
and victim blaming when she's harmed.

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.496
It can also lead a girl to think
that something is wrong with her,

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:21.080
rather than the conditions
in which she finds herself.

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.776
Black girls are routinely seen
as too loud, too aggressive,

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.680
too angry, too visible.

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.016
Qualities that are often measured
in relation to nonblack girls

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:36.976
and which don't take into consideration
what's going on in this girl's life

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.016
or her cultural norms.

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.016
And it's not just in the US.

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:42.616
In South Africa,

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:44.776
black girls at the Pretoria
Girls High School

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.416
were discouraged from attending school
with their hair in its natural state,

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.256
without chemical processing.

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:51.896
What did those girls do?

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:53.240
They protested.

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.576
And it was a beautiful thing to see
the global community for the most part

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.520
wrap its arms around girls
as they stood in their truths.

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.656
But there were those
who saw them as disruptive,

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.336
largely because they dared
to ask the question,

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.376
"Where can we be black
if we can't be black in Africa?"

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.256
(Laughter)

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.616
(Applause)

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:15.080
It's a good question.

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.576
Around the world,

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.720
black girls are grappling
with this question.

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.336
And around the world,

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:26.856
black girls are struggling to be seen,
working to be free

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:28.496
and fighting to be included

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:31.920
in the landscape of promise
that a safe space to learn provides.

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.056
In the US, little girls,
just past their toddler years,

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.800
are being arrested in classrooms
for having a tantrum.

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:42.496
Middle school girls are being
turned away from school

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:45.296
because of the way
they wear their hair naturally

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.720
or because of the way
the clothes fit their bodies.

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.576
High school girls
are experiencing violence

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:53.080
at the hands of police
officers in schools.

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:58.080
Where can black girls be black
without reprimand or punishment?

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.736
And it's not just these incidents.

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:04.816
In my work as a researcher and educator,

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:08.216
I've had an opportunity
to work with girls like Stacy,

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.776
a girl who I profile in my book "Pushout,"

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:13.760
who struggles with
her participation in violence.

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:20.136
She bypasses the neuroscientific
and structural analyses

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:21.576
that science has to offer

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:25.016
about how her adverse
childhood experiences inform

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:27.096
why she's participating in violence

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:30.376
and goes straight to describing herself
as a "problem child,"

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:33.296
largely because that's the language
that educators were using

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:35.200
as they routinely suspended her.

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:38.976
But here's the thing.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.216
Disconnection and the internalization
of harm grow stronger in isolation.

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:47.296
So when girls get in trouble,
we shouldn't be pushing them away,

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:49.120
we should be bringing them in closer.

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:52.736
Education is a critical protective factor

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:55.320
against contact
with the criminal legal system.

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:58.816
So we should be building
out policies and practices

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:00.936
that keep girls connected
to their learning,

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:02.816
rather than pushing them away from it.

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:06.800
It's one of the reasons I like to say
that education is freedom work.

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:11.160
When girls feel safe, they can learn.

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:14.896
When they don't feel safe, they fight,

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:19.920
they protest, they argue,
they flee, they freeze.

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:24.336
The human brain is wired
to protect us when we feel a threat.

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:26.416
And so long as school feels like a threat,

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:29.176
or part of the tapestry of harm
in a girl's life,

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:31.160
she'll be inclined to resist.

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:35.136
But when schools become
locations for healing,

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:37.400
they can also become
locations for learning.

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:42.456
So what does this mean for a school
to become a location for healing?

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:45.736
Well, for one thing, it means
that we have to immediately discontinue

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:50.136
the policies and practices that target
black girls for their hairstyles or dress.

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:56.096
(Applause)

00:07:56.120 --> 00:08:00.176
Let's focus on how
and what a girl learns

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:04.056
rather than policing her body
in ways that facilitate rape culture

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:07.080
or punish children for the conditions
in which they were born.

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:12.760
This is where parents and the community
of concerned adults can enter this work.

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:15.496
Start a conversation with the school

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:18.216
and encourage them
to address their dress code

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:21.376
and other conduct-related policies
as a collaborative project,

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:23.336
with parents and students,

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:26.560
so as to intentionally avoid
bias and discrimination.

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:28.696
Keep in mind, though,

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:31.936
that some of the practices
that harm black girls most are unwritten.

00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:36.256
So we have to continue to do the deep,
internal work to address the biases

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:40.936
that inform how, when and whether we see
black girls for who they actually are,

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:42.560
or what we've been told they are.

00:08:44.159 --> 00:08:46.256
Volunteer at a school

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:51.096
and establish culturally competent
and gender responsive discussion groups

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:54.096
with black girls,
Latinas, indigenous girls

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:57.576
and other students who experience
marginalization in schools

00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:58.856
to give them a safe space

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:01.920
to process their identities
and experiences in schools.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.736
And if schools are to become
locations for healing,

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:07.936
we have to remove police officers

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:10.536
and increase the number
of counselors in schools.

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:16.640
(Applause)

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:20.920
Education is freedom work.

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:26.000
And whatever our point of entry is,
we all have to be freedom fighters.

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:29.056
The good news is that there are schools

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:31.656
that are actively working
to establish themselves

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:35.400
as locations for girls
to see themselves as sacred and loved.

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:41.496
The Columbus City Prep School for Girls
in Columbus, Ohio, is an example of this.

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:44.256
They became an example
the moment their principal declared

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:47.840
that they were no longer going to punish
girls for having "a bad attitude."

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:51.776
In addition to building --

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:54.776
Essentially, what they did
is they built out a robust continuum

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:58.256
of alternatives to suspension,
expulsion and arrest.

00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:02.336
In addition to establishing
a restorative justice program,

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:04.856
they improved their
student and teacher relationships

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:07.816
by ensuring that every girl
has at least one adult on campus

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:10.736
that she can go to
when she's in a moment of crisis.

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:14.216
They built out spaces along the corridors
of the school and in classrooms

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:16.720
for girls to regroup,
if they need a minute to do so.

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:21.216
And they established an advisory program
that provides girls with an opportunity

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:25.456
to start every single day
with the promotion of self-worth,

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:27.640
communication skills and goal setting.

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:29.696
At this school,

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:33.336
they're trying to respond
to a girl's adverse childhood experiences

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:34.856
rather than ignore them.

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:37.720
They bring them in closer;
they don't push them away.

00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:41.896
And as a result, their truancy
and suspension rates have improved,

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:44.936
and girls are arriving at school
increasingly ready to learn

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:47.696
because they know the teachers
there care about them.

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:48.920
That matters.

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:53.296
Schools that integrate the arts
and sports into their curriculum

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:56.096
or that are building out
tranformative programming,

00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:59.856
such as restorative justice,
mindfulness and meditation,

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:04.616
are providing an opportunity for girls
to repair their relationships with others,

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:06.520
but also with themselves.

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:10.896
Responding to the lived,
complex and historical trauma

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:12.416
that our students face

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:16.976
requires all of us who believe
in the promise of children and adolescents

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.136
to build relationships,
learning materials,

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:23.736
human and financial resources
and other tools

00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:28.120
that provide children with an opportunity
to heal, so that they can learn.

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:34.896
Our schools should be places where
we respond to our most vulnerable girls

00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:38.520
as essential to the creation
of a positive school culture.

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:43.696
Our ability to see her promise
should be at its sharpest

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:46.576
when she's in the throws
of poverty and addiction;

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:48.976
when she's reeling
from having been sex-trafficked

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.576
or survived other forms of violence;

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:54.256
when she's at her loudest,

00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:55.480
or her quietest.

00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:59.776
We should be able
to support her intellectual

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:01.816
and social-emotional well-being

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:05.800
whether her shorts reach her knees
or stop mid-thigh or higher.

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:11.056
It might seem like a tall order in a world

00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:13.536
so deeply entrenched
in the politics of fear

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:18.336
to radically imagine schools as locations
where girls can heal and thrive,

00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:21.160
but we have to be bold enough
to set this as our intention.

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:26.296
If we commit to this notion
of education as freedom work,

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:28.616
we can shift educational conditions

00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:32.296
so that no girl, even the most
vulnerable among us,

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:34.016
will get pushed out of school.

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:36.616
And that's a win for all of us.

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:37.896
Thank you.

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:43.760
(Applause)
