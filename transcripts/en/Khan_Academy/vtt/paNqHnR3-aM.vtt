00:00:01.263 --> 00:00:02.795
- [Instructor] What we're
going to do in this video

00:00:02.795 --> 00:00:04.189
is get some practice

00:00:04.189 --> 00:00:07.973
applying u-substitution
to definite integrals.

00:00:07.973 --> 00:00:10.203
So let's say we have the integral,

00:00:10.203 --> 00:00:13.964
so we're gonna go from x
equals one to x equals two,

00:00:13.964 --> 00:00:16.890
and the integral is two x times

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.307
x squared plus one to the third power dx.

00:00:21.905 --> 00:00:24.320
So I already told you that we're
gonna apply u-substitution,

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.898
but it's interesting to be able
to recognize when to use it.

00:00:26.898 --> 00:00:28.570
And the key giveaway here is,

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.752
well I have this x
squared plus one business

00:00:30.752 --> 00:00:32.006
to the third power,

00:00:32.006 --> 00:00:34.305
but then I also have the
derivative of x squared plus one

00:00:34.305 --> 00:00:36.604
which is two x right over here.

00:00:36.604 --> 00:00:38.508
So I can do the substitution.

00:00:38.508 --> 00:00:40.110
I could say,

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.780
u is equal to x squared plus one,

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.356
in which case the derivative
of u with respect to x

00:00:46.356 --> 00:00:50.211
is just two x plus zero or just two x.

00:00:50.211 --> 00:00:52.695
I could write that in differential form.

00:00:52.695 --> 00:00:54.828
A mathematical hand waving
way of thinking about it

00:00:54.828 --> 00:00:57.220
is multiplying both sides by dx.

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.720
And so you get du is equal to two x dx.

00:01:01.655 --> 00:01:03.582
And so at least this part of the integral

00:01:03.582 --> 00:01:05.324
I can rewrite.

00:01:05.324 --> 00:01:06.995
So let me at least write,

00:01:06.995 --> 00:01:08.133
so this is going to be,

00:01:08.133 --> 00:01:09.201
I'll write the integral.

00:01:09.201 --> 00:01:11.639
We're going think about
the bounds in a second.

00:01:11.639 --> 00:01:14.306
So we have u to the third power,

00:01:15.865 --> 00:01:17.948
u, the same orange color,

00:01:19.418 --> 00:01:21.168
u to the third power.

00:01:23.087 --> 00:01:25.989
That's this stuff right over here.

00:01:25.989 --> 00:01:27.156
And then two x

00:01:28.938 --> 00:01:29.771
times dx.

00:01:30.935 --> 00:01:32.909
Remember you could just view this as two x

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.672
times x squared plus one to
the third power times dx.

00:01:35.672 --> 00:01:37.483
So two x times dx,

00:01:37.483 --> 00:01:39.666
well two x times dx, that is du.

00:01:39.666 --> 00:01:41.338
So that and that together,

00:01:41.338 --> 00:01:42.255
that is du.

00:01:43.428 --> 00:01:44.728
Now an interesting question,

00:01:44.728 --> 00:01:46.493
because this isn't an indefinite integral,

00:01:46.493 --> 00:01:47.979
we're not just trying to
find the antiderivative.

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:49.442
This is a definite integral.

00:01:49.442 --> 00:01:52.414
So what happens to our
bounds of integration?

00:01:52.414 --> 00:01:54.829
Well there's two ways that
you can approach this.

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:57.267
You can change your bounds of integration.

00:01:57.267 --> 00:02:00.750
Because this one is x
equals one to x equals two.

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.257
But now we're integrating
with respect to u.

00:02:03.257 --> 00:02:06.346
So one way if you want to keep
your bounds of integration,

00:02:06.346 --> 00:02:08.180
or if you wanna keep
this a definite integral

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:09.434
I guess you could say,

00:02:09.434 --> 00:02:11.988
you would change your bounds
from u is equal to something

00:02:11.988 --> 00:02:14.891
to u is equal to something else.

00:02:14.891 --> 00:02:16.632
And so your bounds of integration,

00:02:16.632 --> 00:02:20.138
let's see when x is
equal to one, what is u?

00:02:20.138 --> 00:02:21.857
Well when x is equal to one,

00:02:21.857 --> 00:02:24.922
you have one squared plus one,

00:02:24.922 --> 00:02:28.846
so you have two, u is equal
to two in that situation.

00:02:28.846 --> 00:02:32.097
When x is equal to two, what is u?

00:02:32.097 --> 00:02:34.395
Well you have two squared which is four

00:02:34.395 --> 00:02:36.694
plus one, which is five,

00:02:36.694 --> 00:02:38.691
so u is equal to five.

00:02:38.691 --> 00:02:40.595
And you won't typically
see someone writing

00:02:40.595 --> 00:02:42.589
u equal two or u equals five.

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:44.586
It's often just from two to five

00:02:44.586 --> 00:02:46.490
because we're integrating
with respect to u,

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:49.532
you assume it's u equals
two to u equals five.

00:02:49.532 --> 00:02:52.434
And so we could just rewrite
this as being equal to

00:02:52.434 --> 00:02:54.851
the integral from two to five

00:02:55.964 --> 00:02:57.714
of u to the third du.

00:02:59.075 --> 00:03:00.468
But it's really important to realize

00:03:00.468 --> 00:03:02.465
why we changed our bounds.

00:03:02.465 --> 00:03:04.787
We are now integrating with respect to u,

00:03:04.787 --> 00:03:06.807
and the way we did it is
we used our substitution

00:03:06.807 --> 00:03:07.945
right over here.

00:03:07.945 --> 00:03:09.826
When x equals one, u is equal to two.

00:03:09.826 --> 00:03:10.940
When x is equal to two,

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.564
two squared plus one, u is equal to five.

00:03:13.564 --> 00:03:16.165
And then we can just evaluate
this right over here.

00:03:16.165 --> 00:03:18.650
Let's see this is going to be equal to,

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.623
the antiderivative of u to the third power

00:03:20.623 --> 00:03:23.040
is u to the fourth over four.

00:03:24.524 --> 00:03:28.007
We're gonna evaluate that at five and two.

00:03:28.007 --> 00:03:32.442
And so this is going to be
five to the fourth over four

00:03:32.442 --> 00:03:35.275
minus two to the fourth over four.

00:03:36.575 --> 00:03:38.503
And then we can simplify this if we like,

00:03:38.503 --> 00:03:41.730
but we've just evaluated
this definite integral.

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.402
Now another way to do it

00:03:43.402 --> 00:03:45.235
is to think about the,

00:03:46.722 --> 00:03:50.414
is to try to solve the
indefinite integral in terms of x

00:03:50.414 --> 00:03:52.922
and use u-substitution as an intermediate.

00:03:52.922 --> 00:03:54.919
So one way to think about this is to say,

00:03:54.919 --> 00:03:57.102
well let's just try to evaluate what

00:03:57.102 --> 00:04:00.074
the indefinite integral of two x

00:04:00.074 --> 00:04:04.241
times x squared plus one
to the third power dx is.

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:07.411
And then whatever this expression

00:04:07.411 --> 00:04:10.128
ends up being algebraically,

00:04:10.128 --> 00:04:13.495
I'm going to evaluate it at x equals two

00:04:13.495 --> 00:04:15.980
and at x equals one.

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:19.439
And so then you use the
u-substitution right over here,

00:04:19.439 --> 00:04:21.668
and you would get.

00:04:21.668 --> 00:04:24.339
This would simplify using
the same substitution

00:04:24.339 --> 00:04:27.922
as the integral of u,
u to the third power,

00:04:30.724 --> 00:04:34.045
the du, u to the third power du,

00:04:34.045 --> 00:04:35.972
and once again you're going to evaluate

00:04:35.972 --> 00:04:39.548
this whole thing from x equals two

00:04:39.548 --> 00:04:40.570
and then subtract from that

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:43.237
it evaluated at x equals one.

00:04:44.563 --> 00:04:46.653
And so this is going to be equal to,

00:04:46.653 --> 00:04:49.765
well let's see this is
u to the fourth power

00:04:49.765 --> 00:04:50.598
over four.

00:04:52.412 --> 00:04:55.407
And once again evaluating
it at x equals two

00:04:55.407 --> 00:04:57.799
and then subtracting from
that at x equals one.

00:04:57.799 --> 00:05:00.214
And then now we can just back-substitute.

00:05:00.214 --> 00:05:01.630
We can say hey look,

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:04.045
u is equal to x squared plus one,

00:05:04.045 --> 00:05:07.714
so this is the same thing
as x squared plus one

00:05:07.714 --> 00:05:10.214
to the fourth power over four,

00:05:11.638 --> 00:05:13.379
and we're now going to evaluate that

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:16.259
at x equals two and at x equals one.

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:17.373
And you will notice that you will get

00:05:17.373 --> 00:05:18.488
the exact same thing.

00:05:18.488 --> 00:05:20.043
When you put x equals two here,

00:05:20.043 --> 00:05:22.087
you get two squared plus one which is five

00:05:22.087 --> 00:05:24.966
to the fourth power over
four, that right over there.

00:05:24.966 --> 00:05:28.124
And then minus one squared plus one is two

00:05:28.124 --> 00:05:29.448
to the fourth power over four,

00:05:29.448 --> 00:05:30.748
that right over there.

00:05:30.748 --> 00:05:32.931
So either way you'll get the same result.

00:05:32.931 --> 00:05:34.974
You can either keep it a definite integral

00:05:34.974 --> 00:05:37.133
and then change your bounds of integration

00:05:37.133 --> 00:05:39.153
and express them in terms of u.

00:05:39.153 --> 00:05:40.431
That's one way to do it.

00:05:40.431 --> 00:05:43.310
The other way is to try to evaluate

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:44.935
the indefinite integral,

00:05:44.935 --> 00:05:47.350
use u-substitution as
an intermediary step,

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:49.602
then back-substitute
back and then evaluate

00:05:49.602 --> 00:05:50.852
at your bounds.
