00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.800
Hey, it's me Destin. Welcome back to Smarter Every Day.

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:07.260
You've probably cranked a car engine thousands of times in your life, right?

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:10.520
You're familiar with that roar as the engine comes to life?

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:13.820
Have you ever thought about what's going on inside the engine?

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.640
Think about it. You've got thousands of explosions happening

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.779
every minute and they all come together

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.459
to make one unified sound.

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:23.220
Well today on Smarter Every Day, I wanted to learn what's

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.540
going on in an individual cylinder.

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:27.460
We kind of get a feel for how an explosion

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.840
propagates inside of a combustion chamber with the transparent potato gun video,

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.520
but for years, I've wanted to see inside of a working engine.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.640
Today on Smarter Every Day, we're going to get to see this.

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.059
Someone posted on the Smarter Every Day

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.739
subreddit that there's a channel called

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.070
805roadking that have created just this:

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.410
a transparent engine. So I loaded up the

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.770
high-speed camera and went to Cinnaminson New Jersey to meet Everett.

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.909
This looks like the right place.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.320
(Destin): You Everett? (Everett):  Destin! Hey, what's up I'm

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.400
D: how's it going?  E: C'mon in.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.680
E: we were just getting your phone because my phones are out

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:01.940
D: Hey, what's up? I'm Destin, nice to meet you.

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:03.900
D: How's it going? 
E: Pretty good. 
D: It's a pleasure to meet you guys.

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.140
Oh dude, you have a jukebox!

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.140
E: You like it? A 1953.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.860
D: That's awesome! That's awesome!

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:10.400
E: I'll let you take a picture of it later.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.460
D: (Laughing) How are you guys doing? Is this the shop?

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:13.820
E: This is it man.

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.220
D: Oh, it smells like freedom!

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.300
(Destin, voiceover): This is Everett. He works with his buddy Mike

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.340
to create all kinds of little mechanical marvels.

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.540
Their specialty is taking apart a single cylinder Briggs &amp; Stratton engine from the 50s

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.640
and converting them into all different types of things.

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.400
For example, this one is turned into a hit and miss engine; which is really hard to do.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.600
This one is an absolute frankenstein. They took four single cylinder engines,

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.520
chopped them up, and put them together to make one four cylinder engine that runs like a kitten.

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:43.380
It's amazing!

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.620
(Mike): The seam is actually right here. 
(D): And you welded that!? 
(M): Yeah

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:54.220
(D): How did you weld four engines together and then have it aligned so a crankshaft could go in there?

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.260
(M): It took a long time to do.

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.380
D: If you don't really appreciate what I'm saying here,

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.400
just understand these guys are doing very difficult things with very crude tools.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.640
They're basically performing mechanical magic.

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.640
Which is why I wanted to see...this.

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.220
D: This is it, huh?

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:11.060
I love it.

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.540
(Voiceover): On a normal Briggs and Stratton engine,

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.800
the spark plug is right in the middle on the top of the cylinder,

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.100
and is fired by a magnet that moves past a coil.

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.200
These guys moved the spark plug so you can see down into the engine

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.940
and came up with a clever way to fire it with a buzz coil from the 1920's.

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.620
They're also running the cylinder on propane instead of gasoline

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.440
Because it's cleaner and it makes the engine last longer.

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.000
Now that we understand that this is basically a normal engine

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.160
that they've taken the metal head off of and replaced it with an acrylic head,

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.740
its time to get the high-speed camera set up

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:40.120
and see the one thing I've been wanting to see for several years

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.520
- an explosion inside the engine.

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.800
(D): I can't tell you how excited I am about this camera mount you built

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.660
(laughing) with its engine hoist.

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.860
It's like, it's the most acoustically-pleasing thing I've seen in a while.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:55.300
M: I just triggered it.

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:33.520
(engine roaring in slow motion) (long roar followed by short sparks and more roaring)

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:34.900
(D, voiceover): Okay this is pretty and all,

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.440
but I want to understand exactly what's happening.

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.680
We have the piston on the left, moving up and down inside the cylinder,

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.460
and two valves on the right.

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:44.600
Let's take a look at how a 4-Stroke Engine works,

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.800
and count off each of the four strokes  along with me.

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.360
The first thing that happens is one of the valves on the right opens,

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:54.320
allowing a fuel-air mixture to be drawn into the cylinder.

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.200
This stroke is called the intake.

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.440
When the piston gets near the bottom of the cylinder,

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:02.460
the intake valve closes, and then piston starts to compress the gas.

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:04.640
This is called the compression stroke.

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.100
The third stroke is the pretty one.

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.120
This is called the power stroke

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.000
the explosion happens and increases the pressure inside the cylinder

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.700
which applies force to the face of the piston pushing it down.

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:19.180
When all those gases have burned after that third stroke, the exhaust valve then opens

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:23.700
and the fourth- stroke called the exhaust stroke clears the cylinder of all those exhaust gasses.

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:28.520
The intake valve then opens back up, and the process starts over and over again.

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:33.620
Timing is everything in an engine to make sure it works properly. For example you want to make sure

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:37.170
the spark happens just before the piston is at top dead-center because

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.780
you want the pressure to be building up at the same time as that piston is ready to start moving back down.

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:45.980
When you hear a person talk about the advancing or retarding of the timing of an engine

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.580
that spark timing is what they're talking about.

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:54.940
If you look really closely you can see this part happens just before the piston reaches the top of the stroke.

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:02.180
I asked Everett and Mike if they would dare to run the engine on gasoline for me

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:05.620
because I wanted to see a brighter flame. I was really excited when they said yes.

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:10.520
And I was even more impressed when they said that they could change that engine over in just a matter of seconds

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.800
(D): so we're already converted, like, you're done? 
(M): that's it

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
(D): that was fast

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:24.600
(Slow motion engine. Burst of sound every time it lights up)

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:28.200
(Regular speed engine sounds)

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.440
(D): man that's good right there.

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.980
(Loud, rapid bursts)

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:36.560
(Electric spark sounds)

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:43.580
(Slow motion flame roar sound)

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:50.270
(D, voiceover): Ok now that you know how an engine works watch each of the four strokes and see if you can identify each one.

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:55.560
intake

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:59.320
compression (sparks sound)

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:02.420
power

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:05.000
exhaust

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:19.300
intake, compression, power, exhaust.

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:23.690
Now think about the engine in your car all the explosions are synchronized together to make that

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:28.720
one constant engine roaring sound.

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:33.320
I think what I found really refreshing about making this video is you've got Everett who is retired

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:35.740
and you got Mike and Bill who later came in the

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:37.120
shop and help us out these guys are

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:39.250
totally different generations but

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:40.630
they're all working together because

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:43.240
they absolutely love engines in, like, a

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:45.100
completely unapologetic way. It's

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:45.940
beautiful

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:46.960
anyway I'll leave links in the video

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:48.370
description to all of their YouTube

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:50.320
channels and I would enjoy it if you

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:51.880
would consider subscribing. They're small

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:55.000
channels that kind of thing would really help them out

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:56.220
(D): Big thanks to 805roadking for

00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:59.350
helping me visualize an engine so, thank you very much

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:02.320
Bill, Everett, Mike, it was a blast

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:06.850
(Everett): This is dirtbike5100 and SmallEngineMechanic 
(D): oh yeah, there you go

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:08.500
these guys all have youtube channels

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:09.790
I'll leave links in the video description

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:12.160
I hope you enjoyed this episode of

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:13.660
smarter every day it was sponsored by

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:15.190
audible and the book I'm about to

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:17.320
recommend means a great deal to me.

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:19.180
You know, Everett and Mike they have this, you know

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:21.040
relationship even though their ages are

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:22.030
quite different.

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:23.770
My dad recommended that I read this book

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:25.330
a long time ago and it was fantastic.

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:27.880
It's about a young man trying to figure

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:30.220
out his way in the world in 12th

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:33.700
century Europe after his dad is taken.

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:35.170
We'll just say that. I don't want to give

00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:40.030
anything away but it's called 
(Audiobook narrator): The Walking Drum by Louis L'Amour

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:41.520
(D): That is John Curless

00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:44.350
and he does a dang good job reading this

00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:46.600
book I enjoyed it. It's a thick book so I can't

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:48.130
really sit down and read this like I

00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:50.730
used to be able to, but with audio books

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:52.480
I can listen to it back and forth on my

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:54.430
drive I've even listened to it while like bush

00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:56.560
hogging the field I really enjoyed this

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:59.140
book it's full of fantastic quotes that

00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:00.970
is just wisdom. I really enjoy it so

00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:04.870
please get this book at audible.com slash

00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:07.030
smarter (Cut) Psst, there's a behind-the-scenes

00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:08.740
video on the second channel goes into

00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:10.210
the timing of that engine, how they

00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:12.310
adjusted to have a shape the acrylic all

00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:14.080
that cool stuff (whispers) go check it out

00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:20.500
Did we just figure out how to.. (E) I think we fixed it (D)... fix it with

00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:28.940
back pressure? We fixed it with back pressure? (M): Look at that!  (D): Oh! Look at that! (Indistinct speech)

00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:31.040
It just needed back pressure?
