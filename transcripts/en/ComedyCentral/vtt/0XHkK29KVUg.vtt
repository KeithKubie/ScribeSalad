00:00:01.534 --> 00:00:04.204
(playful music)

00:00:06.138 --> 00:00:07.840
- Alright, I got a
stain on my button down.

00:00:07.873 --> 00:00:09.609
  I have an interview today.
  I need to get it out.

00:00:09.642 --> 00:00:11.444
 - That? That thing
 shows like no titty.

00:00:11.477 --> 00:00:13.679
 Do you want the job or do
 you want to waste your time?

00:00:13.712 --> 00:00:15.748
  - I need to the
  fucking stain out!

00:00:15.781 --> 00:00:17.617
 - Wow, not gonna get
 it out like that!

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:18.551
  - Dude, I'm sorry.

00:00:18.584 --> 00:00:20.019
  It just cost me 58 bucks.

00:00:20.052 --> 00:00:21.854
 What was the thing that
 your grandmother used to do,

00:00:21.887 --> 00:00:23.089
  the secret trick?

00:00:23.122 --> 00:00:25.558
  - Tomato juice.
  Juice of tomahto.

00:00:25.591 --> 00:00:28.027
 - Tomato juice, are you sure?

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:28.961
 - Yup.

00:00:28.994 --> 00:00:31.498
- Alright. Let me see. Hold on.

00:00:32.698 --> 00:00:34.534
 - God, I love weed.

00:00:34.567 --> 00:00:36.102
- Okay, alright, I
don't have tomato juice

00:00:36.135 --> 00:00:37.603
 but I have Bloody Mary mix.

00:00:37.636 --> 00:00:38.905
  - Ooh that's even better.

00:00:38.938 --> 00:00:40.807
 The horseradish will
 exfoliate the stain.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.141
  - Awesome.

00:00:42.174 --> 00:00:44.343
  Okay, here we go.

00:00:44.376 --> 00:00:46.112
Okay so do I rub it in?

00:00:46.145 --> 00:00:48.915
 - Yes, rub it in. Smart. Good.

00:00:48.948 --> 00:00:50.216
 Is it working?

00:00:50.249 --> 00:00:53.019
 - I don't know if it's
 making it look better.

00:00:53.052 --> 00:00:56.022
 - Wait you did. You applied?

00:00:56.055 --> 00:00:57.323
- Did I put the?

00:00:57.356 --> 00:00:58.891
 Yeah, you just watched
 me do the whole thing.

00:00:58.924 --> 00:01:01.561
  - I just remembered that
  that was the wrong trick.

00:01:01.594 --> 00:01:03.429
  Tomato juice is
  for skunk sprays.

00:01:03.462 --> 00:01:04.597
 - Are you ki-?

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:06.132
- You know what I
realized her trick was?

00:01:06.165 --> 00:01:07.900
A couple drops of
detergent on the stain.

00:01:07.933 --> 00:01:09.068
And then you let it sit.

00:01:09.101 --> 00:01:10.369
 And then you wash it normally.

00:01:10.402 --> 00:01:11.537
  Do you have time for that?

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.440
 - Her trick was
 pre-treating a stain?

00:01:14.473 --> 00:01:15.975
 We all know

00:01:16.008 --> 00:01:17.577
how to pre-treat

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.479
  a stain, Grandma!

00:01:19.512 --> 00:01:22.381
 - Hey! Turn that pout
 inside out, sister.

00:01:22.414 --> 00:01:24.050
 Cause you know what?

00:01:24.083 --> 00:01:26.686
 Now you have no choice but to
 show your freaking titties.

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:27.954
 And that's how you're
 gonna get a damn job,

00:01:27.987 --> 00:01:31.190
 in this city,
 fucking (bleep) town.

00:01:31.223 --> 00:01:32.825
 - You think I
 could go like this?

00:01:32.858 --> 00:01:35.394
 - Go like this?
 Take the pants off.

00:01:35.427 --> 00:01:37.964
 - I'm going to interview to
 be a docent at the Frick.

00:01:37.997 --> 00:01:40.733
- Yeah well your ass is more
powerful than your tits. Sorry!

00:01:40.766 --> 00:01:43.769
- Let me just get my bag
and then I have to go.

00:01:43.802 --> 00:01:45.471
- Oh yeah, there it is.

00:01:45.504 --> 00:01:47.907
Mm get that job, bitch.

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:49.976
 - You know what? I am
 gonna get that job.

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.612
 You know why? Cause
 I love the Frick.

00:01:52.645 --> 00:01:54.314
 - Bend over a bunch.

00:01:55.414 --> 00:01:58.084
(playful music)
