00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
It shouldn't be too hard to figure out the answer in this case.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
All you have to do is try these examples that I've got here with these functions.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
The one that works is this floor log base 2 of x plus 1.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
If you don't know what the log base 2 of x is, well, that's essentially what it is

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
that we're learning about here.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Log base 2 of x is easy to define for powers of 2.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
It's just what power of 2 it is.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:27.000
The log base 2 of x is 0 for 1, 1 for 2, 2 for 4, 3 for 8, and 4 for 16, and so on.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
What's happening in this case is the log base 2 of x is something less than 2 up until here.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
We round it down. We get these as--

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Well, let's do that. Let's do the floor.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
That gives us 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, and so on.

00:00:42.000 --> 09:59:59.000
We need to add 1 to it to capture this notion.
