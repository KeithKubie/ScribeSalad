00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:03.600
Tommy is studying for
final exams this weekend.

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.390
He will spend 1/5 of
the weekend studying.

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.660
What fraction of
the weekend will he

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:13.260
spend studying for
each of his 4 subjects

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.040
if he spends the same amount of
time studying for each subject?

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.050
So the total amount
of time he's going

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.730
to spend studying this
weekend is 1/5 of the weekend.

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.300
And he has to divide that
into 4 equal sections.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.190
And he's going to spend that
much time on each subject.

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:35.160
So he's going to
divide this by 4.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.380
Now, we've already seen
that dividing by a number

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:41.052
is the same thing as
multiplying by its reciprocal.

00:00:41.052 --> 00:00:43.260
You might say, hey, well,
what's the reciprocal of 4?

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.250
You just have to
remind yourself that 4

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.980
is the same thing as 4/1.

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:58.100
So 1/5 divided by 4/1 is the
same thing as 1/5 times 1/4.

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:04.080
And you could also view
this as 1/4 of 1/5 or 1/5

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.760
of 1/4, either way.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.570
But here we multiply
our numerators to get 1.

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.500
And then we multiply our
denominators, 4 times 5 is 20.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.980
So you get 1/20 of
the weekend will

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:18.890
be spent studying
for each subject.

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.660
Now, let's also try to
think about this visually.

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:25.050
Let's imagine that this
is his entire weekend.

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.790
And I've divided it
into 5 equal sections.

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:29.960
And so we already know
that the total amount

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.350
of his weekend spent
studying is 1/5.

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.600
So that's the total
amount studying

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.660
for the weekend is 1/5.

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:39.370
Now, he has to divide this
into 4 equals section.

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:40.977
So let's do that.

00:01:40.977 --> 00:01:42.560
He's got four subjects,
and he's going

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.840
to spend the same amount of
time on each of the 4 subjects.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.590
So he's going to divide
this into 4 equal sections.

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.870
So how much time does
he spend on one subject?

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:55.860
Well, in each subject, that
would be this little area

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.880
that I'm doing in
yellow right over here.

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:58.880
And what is that?

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.425
Well, that's 1 over-- how
many equal sections are there

00:02:03.425 --> 00:02:05.080
of that size in the weekend?

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.760
Well, I've just
drawn out the grid.

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.310
You had 5 rows, and
now you have 4 columns.

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.720
So 5 rows times 4 columns,
you have 20 equal sections.

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.730
So once again, looking
at it visually,

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.820
he's spending 1/20
of his weekend

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.760
on each of the 4 subjects.

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.630
And then if you do this
for 4 subjects, that

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.300
means that in this
whole weekend,

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.769
1/5 will be spent studying.

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:30.310
But the question
that they're asking,

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.180
he's spending 1/20 of the
weekend on each subject.
