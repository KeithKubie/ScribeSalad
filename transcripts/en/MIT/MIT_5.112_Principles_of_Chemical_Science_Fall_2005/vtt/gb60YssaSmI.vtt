00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.881
Let's get started.
We have a lot more chemistry to

00:00:18.881 --> 00:00:21.732
learn today.
And, as you are probably

00:00:21.732 --> 00:00:25.059
becoming aware,
the octahedron plays a very

00:00:25.059 --> 00:00:29.019
important role in the
coordination chemistry of the

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:33.189
d-block elements.
So we are going to begin today

00:00:33.189 --> 00:00:37.131
also with the octahedron.
And I just want to remind you

00:00:37.131 --> 00:00:41.364
of the approach that we were
taking on Monday to understand

00:00:41.364 --> 00:00:45.744
how d-orbitals split under the
influence of the presence of a

00:00:45.744 --> 00:00:48.518
set of ligands.
And this splitting I am

00:00:48.518 --> 00:00:51.072
referring to is an energy
splitting.

00:00:51.072 --> 00:00:55.306
We are talking once again about
how we can use energy level

00:00:55.306 --> 00:00:59.175
diagrams to understand and
interpret the properties of

00:00:59.175 --> 00:01:02.948
molecules.
And today, in particular,

00:01:02.948 --> 00:01:07.233
we are going to be thinking
about how we can go from the

00:01:07.233 --> 00:01:11.753
angular properties of the d
orbitals all the way to some of

00:01:11.753 --> 00:01:16.584
the magnetic and spectroscopic
or color properties of ions that

00:01:16.584 --> 00:01:19.779
contain these d-block transition
elements.

00:01:19.779 --> 00:01:23.285
And so, you will remember last
time on Monday,

00:01:23.285 --> 00:01:28.194
we looked at placing ligands at
positions one through six on the

00:01:28.194 --> 00:01:32.792
octahedron in reference to our
coordinate system that we had

00:01:32.792 --> 00:01:37.000
chosen, x, y,
and z here, as specified.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.959
And what we were doing was,
at each of these positions that

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:46.319
corresponds to a ligand atom,
evaluating each of the

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:51.193
d-orbitals for the value of
theta and phi that is found at

00:01:51.193 --> 00:01:55.382
that ligand position.
And so, I am going to put up

00:01:55.382 --> 00:02:00.000
part of the table that we
generated last time.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.676
And that part will correspond
to ligand position,

00:02:04.676 --> 00:02:08.865
where we have ligands one,
two, three, four,

00:02:08.865 --> 00:02:12.859
five, and six.
Those six ligand positions.

00:02:12.859 --> 00:02:18.802
And two of the d orbitals here,
d z squared and d x

00:02:18.802 --> 00:02:24.550
squared minus y squared,
were found to give

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:30.395
non-zero values at these six
ligand positions that correspond

00:02:30.395 --> 00:02:36.543
to an octahedral complex.
The other three d-orbitals gave

00:02:36.543 --> 00:02:41.630
zero at those positions because
all six of these ligands lie on

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.092
nodal planes of xz,
yz, and xy.

00:02:44.092 --> 00:02:47.538
And what we are doing is just
writing down,

00:02:47.538 --> 00:02:51.312
in tabular form,
the relative magnitude of what

00:02:51.312 --> 00:02:55.415
you get if you evaluate the
orbital at those ligand

00:02:55.415 --> 00:02:58.779
positions.
We had one in positions one and

00:02:58.779 --> 00:03:03.866
six, which are on the big lobes
of d z squared along

00:03:03.866 --> 00:03:08.375
the z-axis.
And we set that to one because

00:03:08.375 --> 00:03:13.126
that is the largest value that
we get when we evaluate any of

00:03:13.126 --> 00:03:16.293
the orbitals.
And then, relative to that,

00:03:16.293 --> 00:03:20.964
these ligands two through five
that are in the x,y-plane and

00:03:20.964 --> 00:03:25.557
which interact with the torus of
the d z squared

00:03:25.557 --> 00:03:29.912
orbital in the x,y-plane,
have a value of one-quarter of

00:03:29.912 --> 00:03:35.589
what it is along the z-axis.
And then, d x squared minus y

00:03:35.589 --> 00:03:40.410
squared
evaluated at positions one and

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:44.696
six gave us a zero.
And that is because positions

00:03:44.696 --> 00:03:49.250
one and six fall on the z-axis,
which is actually an

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:54.517
intersection of two nodal planes
for the d x squared minus y

00:03:54.517 --> 00:03:58.178
squared orbital.
And then, here we have at

00:03:58.178 --> 00:04:03.000
positions two through five,
three-quarters.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.169
And if you are having trouble
understanding what these numbers

00:04:15.169 --> 00:04:18.449
mean, remember that we started
out with a sphere,

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:21.935
so we are interested in seeing
essentially, what the

00:04:21.935 --> 00:04:25.967
probability is in finding that
electron in that particular d

00:04:25.967 --> 00:04:30.000
orbital at that point on the
surface of the sphere.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.587
And so what this is saying is
that, if you will,

00:04:33.587 --> 00:04:37.480
the radial probability of
finding an electron in d z

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:41.984
squared along the
torus at some distance from the

00:04:41.984 --> 00:04:46.564
center is one-quarter what it is
along the z-axis at the same

00:04:46.564 --> 00:04:50.152
distance from the center.
And then, at that same

00:04:50.152 --> 00:04:54.351
distance, if we are in the
x,y-plane along x or along y,

00:04:54.351 --> 00:04:59.007
because that is where the lobes
of d x squared minus y squared

00:04:59.007 --> 00:05:02.748
extend,
that probability drops to

00:05:02.748 --> 00:05:07.175
three-quarters relative to the
two big lobes of d z squared

00:05:07.175 --> 00:05:11.754
along z.
You can think of it as telling

00:05:11.754 --> 00:05:14.621
you about the size of the lobes.
And, accordingly,

00:05:14.621 --> 00:05:18.306
the way that these lobes of the
d-orbitals can interact with the

00:05:18.306 --> 00:05:21.874
ligands at these positions on
the surface of the sphere coming

00:05:21.874 --> 00:05:24.916
right out of evaluating the
angular parts of the wave

00:05:24.916 --> 00:05:26.905
function.
And then, there are other

00:05:26.905 --> 00:05:29.713
important coordination
geometries that we have to

00:05:29.713 --> 00:05:33.055
consider.
Because coordination number

00:05:33.055 --> 00:05:37.165
six, which corresponds to the
octahedron, is relatively

00:05:37.165 --> 00:05:40.057
common.
But coordination number four is

00:05:40.057 --> 00:05:43.254
also quite common.
And one of the important

00:05:43.254 --> 00:05:47.517
coordination geometries for
coordination number four is a

00:05:47.517 --> 00:05:50.028
tetrahedral coordination
geometry.

00:05:50.028 --> 00:05:54.519
The tetrahedron is not limited
to being important in organic

00:05:54.519 --> 00:05:57.107
chemistry.
It is also important for

00:05:57.107 --> 00:06:02.267
coordination chemistry.
And you will recall that when

00:06:02.267 --> 00:06:06.959
we look at a tetrahedron we talk
about ligands at alternating

00:06:06.959 --> 00:06:10.556
corners of a cube.
And I will call these ligand

00:06:10.556 --> 00:06:12.746
positions seven,
eight, nine,

00:06:12.746 --> 00:06:15.639
and ten.
And, if we have a tetrahedral

00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:20.018
metal complex with four ligands,
be they water ligands or

00:06:20.018 --> 00:06:23.616
chloride ligands and be the
central metal ions,

00:06:23.616 --> 00:06:27.526
something like cobalt two
or nickel two,

00:06:27.526 --> 00:06:33.000
a tetrahedral array
like this is produced.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.576
And we can go ahead and
evaluate the d orbital wave

00:06:37.576 --> 00:06:42.793
functions at theta and phi
values that correspond to these

00:06:42.793 --> 00:06:45.447
positions, seven,
eight, nine,

00:06:45.447 --> 00:06:49.932
and ten, all at the same
distance from the center.

00:06:49.932 --> 00:06:53.593
And then we can generate a
similar table,

00:06:53.593 --> 00:06:58.077
where we have our ligand
position and our set of d

00:06:58.077 --> 00:07:02.968
orbitals.
And I will start here with

00:07:02.968 --> 00:07:07.193
d(xz), d(yz) and d(xy),
and over here,

00:07:07.193 --> 00:07:14.159
d z squared and d x
squared minus y squared.

00:07:14.159 --> 00:07:17.813
And we need our ligands

00:07:17.813 --> 00:07:21.467
positioned at seven,
eight, nine,

00:07:21.467 --> 00:07:27.861
and ten, which are these
alternating corners of the cube,

00:07:27.861 --> 00:07:33.000
which is the tetrahedral
geometry.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.563
And what we find,
when we go through and evaluate

00:07:37.563 --> 00:07:43.362
for those theta and phi values
that correspond to these ligand

00:07:43.362 --> 00:07:48.211
positions using our polar
coordinate system and then

00:07:48.211 --> 00:07:54.200
scaling it the same way that we
do over here for the octahedron,

00:07:54.200 --> 00:08:00.000
is that all of these values
come out to be one-third.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.916
Notice that,
in the case of the octahedron,

00:08:02.916 --> 00:08:07.291
we are interacting with some of
the lobes, like the lobes of d z

00:08:07.291 --> 00:08:09.652
squared,
the large ones,

00:08:09.652 --> 00:08:13.055
directly along the axis that
makes it a pure sigma

00:08:13.055 --> 00:08:16.527
interaction, a cylindrically
symmetric interaction.

00:08:16.527 --> 00:08:20.347
A big lobe of d z squared
and a ligand coming

00:08:20.347 --> 00:08:23.333
in along the z-axis.
But if you think of the

00:08:23.333 --> 00:08:27.569
positions of the lobes of the
xz, yz, and xy orbitals relative

00:08:27.569 --> 00:08:30.277
to these ligand positions,
seven, eight,

00:08:30.277 --> 00:08:33.055
nine, and ten,
the interaction is kind of

00:08:33.055 --> 00:08:36.096
oblique.
It is not zero.

00:08:36.096 --> 00:08:39.312
We are not on a node,
but it is pretty small.

00:08:39.312 --> 00:08:42.090
The overlap is not going to be
as good.

00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:46.184
And it evaluates to one-third
for all of those positions.

00:08:46.184 --> 00:08:50.497
What we find is that while xz,
yz, and xy were all zero over

00:08:50.497 --> 00:08:54.809
here for the octahedral case,
over here, for the tetrahedral

00:08:54.809 --> 00:09:00.000
case, they are all the same
again, but they are not at zero.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.859
They are at one-third.
And then, for x squared minus y

00:09:03.859 --> 00:09:07.355
squared,
remember x squared minus y

00:09:07.355 --> 00:09:09.904
squared has its lobes along x
and y.

00:09:09.904 --> 00:09:13.109
What that means is that ligands
seven, eight,

00:09:13.109 --> 00:09:17.697
nine, and ten actually lie on a
nodal surface of the d x squared

00:09:17.697 --> 00:09:21.411
minus y squared orbital.
And that means that this is

00:09:21.411 --> 00:09:23.742
zero, this is zero,
this is zero,

00:09:23.742 --> 00:09:29.203
and this is zero.
And the amazing thing about the

00:09:29.203 --> 00:09:34.784
math of the tetrahedral geometry
is that these ligands,

00:09:34.784 --> 00:09:39.124
seven, eight,
nine, and ten also lie on the

00:09:39.124 --> 00:09:43.155
nodal surface of d z squared.

00:09:43.155 --> 00:09:49.458
Remember that d z squared looks
like this and has our opposite

00:09:49.458 --> 00:09:54.936
phase torus in the middle and
then has a conical nodal

00:09:54.936 --> 00:10:00.000
surface.
We actually went ahead and --

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.281
If you set the equation for d z
squared equal to zero

00:10:05.281 --> 00:10:08.886
and solved for it,
we found this angle here.

00:10:08.886 --> 00:10:13.161
We found that angle.
And you will remember that that

00:10:13.161 --> 00:10:16.766
was the arc cosine of root three
over three.

00:10:16.766 --> 00:10:21.964
It turns out that that value is
exactly half of the tetrahedral

00:10:21.964 --> 00:10:25.233
angle, which is the angel
between seven,

00:10:25.233 --> 00:10:29.615
the center and eight.
And, because of this,

00:10:29.615 --> 00:10:31.538
all ligands,
seven, eight,

00:10:31.538 --> 00:10:35.538
nine, and ten lie on the
conical nodal surface of d z

00:10:35.538 --> 00:10:39.153
squared,
such that we get zeros here,

00:10:39.153 --> 00:10:41.538
too.
One thing that relates very

00:10:41.538 --> 00:10:46.076
nicely, the orbital picture for
the tetrahedral case for the

00:10:46.076 --> 00:10:49.615
octahedral case,
is that z squared has the same

00:10:49.615 --> 00:10:52.307
energy as x squared minus y
squared.

00:10:52.307 --> 00:10:55.538
When you sum over all the
ligand positions,

00:10:55.538 --> 00:11:00.153
we are going to get three here,
and we are going to get three

00:11:00.153 --> 00:11:04.394
here.
And xz, yz, and xy all have

00:11:04.394 --> 00:11:06.344
zero.
And over here xz,

00:11:06.344 --> 00:11:09.093
yz, and xy all have
four-thirds.

00:11:09.093 --> 00:11:14.236
And z squared and x
squared minus y squared

00:11:14.236 --> 00:11:18.758
both have zero.
And so I will redraw that over

00:11:18.758 --> 00:11:20.000
here.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:33.098
What we are doing is drawing up
d orbital splitting diagrams for

00:11:33.098 --> 00:11:37.225
two different possible
coordination geometries for a

00:11:37.225 --> 00:11:41.028
coordination complex.
Let me just make that very

00:11:41.028 --> 00:11:42.000
clear.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.301
And I have my energy units
here, zero, one,

00:12:08.301 --> 00:12:11.445
two, three.
And this energy level diagram

00:12:11.445 --> 00:12:14.117
looks like this for the
octahedral.

00:12:14.117 --> 00:12:18.519
And we symbolize the octahedral
geometry with this Oh for

00:12:18.519 --> 00:12:21.427
octahedral.
And we have here an energy

00:12:21.427 --> 00:12:27.954
splitting.
We have a triply degenerate set

00:12:27.954 --> 00:12:35.625
of orbitals which we recognize
as xz, yz, and xy.

00:12:35.625 --> 00:12:44.735
And the name that we give to
that triply degenerate set is

00:12:44.735 --> 00:12:50.168
t(2g).
This t(2g) triply degenerate

00:12:50.168 --> 00:12:58.000
set, for this whole set,
is the t(2g) set.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.164
If I use that label t(2g),
you should remember the

00:13:01.164 --> 00:13:04.716
specific d orbitals that
contribute to the t(2g) set and

00:13:04.716 --> 00:13:08.009
make up the t2g set.
Up here we have the d z squared

00:13:08.009 --> 00:13:12.013
and the d x squared
minus y squared

00:13:12.013 --> 00:13:15.242
at the same energy,
which are three relative energy

00:13:15.242 --> 00:13:17.373
units here.
And those two together

00:13:17.373 --> 00:13:20.667
constitute the e(g) set.
And I will often write that

00:13:20.667 --> 00:13:23.896
with a star because we are going
to find out later,

00:13:23.896 --> 00:13:27.383
when we do the molecular
orbital theory of coordination

00:13:27.383 --> 00:13:31.000
complexes, that these are
antibonding.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.242
And the reason they are
antibonding is because,

00:13:34.242 --> 00:13:38.472
if you go over here and look at
it, if you have a ligand that

00:13:38.472 --> 00:13:42.349
wants to act as a Lewis base
with respect to d z squared,

00:13:42.349 --> 00:13:45.874
then putting an
electron in d z squared

00:13:45.874 --> 00:13:49.751
leads to repulsion of
that ligand, generating

00:13:49.751 --> 00:13:53.276
antibonding characters.
You want your Lewis acid to

00:13:53.276 --> 00:13:58.000
have empty orbitals to receive
lone pairs of electrons.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.914
And, if instead they are
populated, that corresponds to

00:14:01.914 --> 00:14:05.684
antibonding character,
much like we have talked about

00:14:05.684 --> 00:14:08.947
for other types of molecular
orbital diagrams.

00:14:08.947 --> 00:14:12.572
This d-orbital splitting
diagram for Oh is really a

00:14:12.572 --> 00:14:16.559
simplified molecular orbital
diagram for the molecule in

00:14:16.559 --> 00:14:20.620
which we just look at those
orbitals that derive from the

00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:23.519
set of five d orbitals on that
metal ion.

00:14:23.519 --> 00:14:27.000
Because these are the orbitals,
--

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.534
-- and, together with the
electrons that occupy them,

00:14:31.534 --> 00:14:36.940
they control the properties of
color and magnetism that we will

00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:40.253
be talking about for the rest of
today.

00:14:40.253 --> 00:14:45.746
And let me remind you here that
we have a name for the magnitude

00:14:45.746 --> 00:14:49.670
of this splitting,
which is called delta O for

00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:52.896
octahedral.
And then, we also have the

00:14:52.896 --> 00:14:56.907
tetrahedral case.
And how do we get the diagram

00:14:56.907 --> 00:15:00.680
from this?
We just sum over the

00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:04.630
contributions from each of the
ligand positions.

00:15:04.630 --> 00:15:08.243
In tetrahedral,
there are only four ligands.

00:15:08.243 --> 00:15:13.033
For xz, yz, and zy we have to
sum up four times one-third,

00:15:13.033 --> 00:15:17.067
and that gives us,
for that set of three orbitals

00:15:17.067 --> 00:15:22.193
using the same energy scale as
over there, three orbitals at a

00:15:22.193 --> 00:15:27.067
value of four-thirds and two
orbitals down here at our zero

00:15:27.067 --> 00:15:32.276
of energy.
And these will be d z squared,

00:15:32.276 --> 00:15:38.378
located on that
node, and x squared minus y

00:15:38.378 --> 00:15:44.028
squared.
Whereas, up here we have xz,

00:15:44.028 --> 00:15:48.548
yz, and zy.
And these get the names e and

00:15:48.548 --> 00:15:52.163
t(2) in the tetrahedral
geometry.

00:15:52.163 --> 00:15:58.717
And the splitting between the
levels, the doubly degenerate

00:15:58.717 --> 00:16:04.028
and the triply degenerate pair
of energy levels,

00:16:04.028 --> 00:16:11.987
is here referred to as delta t.
And from the math of these two

00:16:11.987 --> 00:16:18.161
tables and the magnitude of this
splitting being three relative

00:16:18.161 --> 00:16:23.639
to this one being four-thirds,
you can easily derive the

00:16:23.639 --> 00:16:29.215
relation that delta t is equal
to four-ninths of delta O.

00:16:29.215 --> 00:16:35.545
One of the neat things about

00:16:35.545 --> 00:16:40.818
this result qualitatively is
that if you have more ligands,

00:16:40.818 --> 00:16:45.000
six versus four,
you have a larger splitting of

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.454
the energy levels.
And that corresponds to putting

00:16:49.454 --> 00:16:53.000
more Lewis bases,
more negative charges,

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.545
around that sphere that we
talked about,

00:16:56.545 --> 00:17:02.106
in the coordination sphere.
And also, if you have

00:17:02.106 --> 00:17:08.526
interactions between ligands and
metal d orbitals that are end-on

00:17:08.526 --> 00:17:12.338
sigma symmetry,
directed at each other,

00:17:12.338 --> 00:17:17.554
you get bigger splitting
because that leads to better

00:17:17.554 --> 00:17:23.974
overlap than the type of oblique
overlap that you get if you have

00:17:23.974 --> 00:17:29.793
a ligand at a position such as
seven relative to an orbital

00:17:29.793 --> 00:17:33.952
like d(xz).
You can now see that to fully

00:17:33.952 --> 00:17:37.049
appreciate this,
you really have to have a very

00:17:37.049 --> 00:17:40.551
good grasp of the nodal
properties of the d orbitals.

00:17:40.551 --> 00:17:44.119
This is why I am going to
re-emphasize that you should

00:17:44.119 --> 00:17:48.092
spend some time on the computer
visualizing these things and

00:17:48.092 --> 00:17:52.334
rotating them around and seeing
where these ligand positions for

00:17:52.334 --> 00:17:56.239
these different coordination
geometries are with respect to

00:17:56.239 --> 00:18:00.610
each of the five d orbitals.
That is quite important.

00:18:00.610 --> 00:18:04.299
Also, you are going to see that
you could consider other

00:18:04.299 --> 00:18:08.392
possible coordination geometries
that involve ligands at these

00:18:08.392 --> 00:18:12.484
positions or at other positions.
For coordination number five,

00:18:12.484 --> 00:18:16.308
you could have a trigonal
bipyramid coordination geometry.

00:18:16.308 --> 00:18:20.064
And you could go ahead and
evaluate the d orbitals at the

00:18:20.064 --> 00:18:23.419
relevant positions.
You would already have three of

00:18:23.419 --> 00:18:27.176
them here because in a trigonal
bipyramid, you would have

00:18:27.176 --> 00:18:31.000
ligands at positions one and
six, and two.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.178
And then two more back here at
120 degrees to two,

00:18:34.178 --> 00:18:37.098
but in the x,y-plane.
So you can do a trigonal

00:18:37.098 --> 00:18:40.861
bipyramid the same way and
generate the d-orbital splitting

00:18:40.861 --> 00:18:43.780
diagram for it.
You can also go ahead and do a

00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:47.089
d-orbital splitting diagram for
a different geometry

00:18:47.089 --> 00:18:50.982
corresponding to coordination
number four, which would be the

00:18:50.982 --> 00:18:53.252
square planar coordination
geometry.

00:18:53.252 --> 00:18:55.653
If you just took ligand
positions two,

00:18:55.653 --> 00:18:58.313
three, four,
and five you could generate a

00:18:58.313 --> 00:19:01.740
diagram.
And that diagram would be

00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:05.848
relevant for systems that do
have square planar coordination

00:19:05.848 --> 00:19:09.398
around a metal center,
and these are actually fairly

00:19:09.398 --> 00:19:12.044
common.
Those are the four coordination

00:19:12.044 --> 00:19:14.481
geometries, octahedral,
tetrahedral,

00:19:14.481 --> 00:19:17.892
trigonal bipyramid,
and square planar that are all

00:19:17.892 --> 00:19:22.208
pretty commonly encountered and
that you can actually interpret

00:19:22.208 --> 00:19:25.829
pretty nicely using the
d-orbital splitting diagrams.

00:19:25.829 --> 00:19:29.588
Now, one of the properties that
we are going to want to

00:19:29.588 --> 00:19:33.000
interpret will be the magnetism.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:54.663
And, in talking about the
magnetism of coordination

00:19:54.663 --> 00:20:00.632
complexes, we are going to start
by mentioning two terms that you

00:20:00.632 --> 00:20:04.922
have probably heard,
but I would like to define

00:20:04.922 --> 00:20:08.373
explicitly today.
One is paramagnetic.

00:20:08.373 --> 00:20:13.036
That term is given to
substances that are attracted

00:20:13.036 --> 00:20:17.979
into a magnetic field.
It is somehow a bulk phenomenon

00:20:17.979 --> 00:20:22.922
that we are going to relate to
properties of d orbital

00:20:22.922 --> 00:20:26.000
splitting diagrams.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.323
And systems can also be
described as diamagnetic.

00:20:38.323 --> 00:20:42.338
And there are many other types
of magnetic behavior that we

00:20:42.338 --> 00:20:50.327
won't be discussing.
I'm a little too close to the

00:20:50.327 --> 00:20:56.000
board, here.
Diamagnetic.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:02.928
And that means that the
substance is repelled out of or

00:21:02.928 --> 00:21:10.113
away from a magnetic field.
And one thing that you should

00:21:10.113 --> 00:21:16.913
keep in mind is that the
magnitude of paramagnetism is

00:21:16.913 --> 00:21:24.098
usually orders of magnitude
greater than the magnitude of

00:21:24.098 --> 00:21:30.000
diamagnetism.
So, this is much larger.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.331
And what this means is if a
substance behaves as a

00:21:37.331 --> 00:21:41.002
paramagnet, you can often
neglect its diamagnetism that

00:21:41.002 --> 00:21:43.789
also may be present,
also must be present.

00:21:43.789 --> 00:21:46.780
The substances that are
paramagnetic are also

00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:50.247
diamagnetic, but the
paramagnetism is much larger in

00:21:50.247 --> 00:21:53.239
terms of its order of magnitude
and wins out.

00:21:53.239 --> 00:21:57.250
If you want to measure one of
these quantities for a system,

00:21:57.250 --> 00:22:00.581
that which is far more
difficult to measure is the

00:22:00.581 --> 00:22:05.000
diamagnetism because it is a
much smaller number.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:11.769
And then, I want to bring up
this quantity S.

00:22:11.769 --> 00:22:17.000
This is the spin quantum
number.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:35.539
And you can readily calculate S
from looking at a populated d

00:22:35.539 --> 00:22:43.329
orbital spitting diagram because
it will be the total number of

00:22:43.329 --> 00:22:50.115
electrons multiplied by
one-half, which is the spin per

00:22:50.115 --> 00:22:52.000
electron.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:03.887
If you are confronted with a
particular coordination complex,

00:23:03.887 --> 00:23:07.645
the kind of thought process you
will need to go through is,

00:23:07.645 --> 00:23:11.274
what is the coordination
number, what is the coordination

00:23:11.274 --> 00:23:14.838
geometry, what does the d
orbital splitting diagram look

00:23:14.838 --> 00:23:18.725
like, how many electrons do I
have with which to populate the

00:23:18.725 --> 00:23:22.548
d orbital splitting diagram?
After I have figured out how to

00:23:22.548 --> 00:23:26.306
populate the d orbital splitting
diagram, how many of those

00:23:26.306 --> 00:23:30.000
electrons are unpaired?
That gives me this.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:33.333
I can then calculate S.
And, if I have S,

00:23:33.333 --> 00:23:38.166
I can make a prediction about
the value of something called

00:23:38.166 --> 00:23:41.000
the spin-only magnetic moment.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:54.304
Let me mention one more thing
back here, and that would be the

00:23:54.304 --> 00:23:55.000
units.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:08.467
When we talk about magnetism,
we are going to be using units.

00:24:08.467 --> 00:24:12.450
This is called the Bohr
magneton.

00:24:12.450 --> 00:24:18.051
It is sometimes written as mu
sub b.

00:24:18.051 --> 00:24:24.648
It is also sometimes written as
capital B., capital M.

00:24:24.648 --> 00:24:30.000
That is the Bohr
magneton.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:39.799
And it is equal to
9.2741x10^-24 joules per tesla.

00:24:39.799 --> 00:24:47.400
This is the value of the Bohr
magneton.

00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:58.400
And the Bohr magneton is the
unit, also, of our magnetic

00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:01.000
moment.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:14.117
And in particular,
today, I am going to be talking

00:25:14.117 --> 00:25:18.151
about the spin-only value of the
magnetic moment.

00:25:18.151 --> 00:25:22.773
So we are going to be making
predictions using spin-only

00:25:22.773 --> 00:25:26.470
considerations.
And for those considerations,

00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:30.000
we need to be able to calculate
S.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:34.397
And we can do that pretty
quickly after we have it

00:25:34.397 --> 00:25:38.525
correctly populated,
correctly chosen d orbital

00:25:38.525 --> 00:25:41.397
splitting diagram for the
system.

00:25:41.397 --> 00:25:46.871
And so the spin-only value for
the magnetic moment is given by

00:25:46.871 --> 00:25:50.551
this formula,
which is mu is equal to 2.00

00:25:50.551 --> 00:25:54.410
times the square root of S times
S plus one.

00:25:54.410 --> 00:26:00.655
And, in this formula,

00:26:00.655 --> 00:26:06.850
this part, this square root of
S times S plus one,

00:26:06.850 --> 00:26:13.678
from the quantum mechanics,
is the value of the angular

00:26:13.678 --> 00:26:20.000
momentum, the electron spin
angular momentum.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:34.443
And this value 2.00,
I am calling it 2.00.

00:26:34.443 --> 00:26:40.837
It is actually a number that
differs only very slightly from

00:26:40.837 --> 00:26:44.413
two.
So we can, for most purposes,

00:26:44.413 --> 00:26:48.748
use 2.00.
This is called the gyromagnetic

00:26:48.748 --> 00:26:52.000
ratio of the electron.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:04.905
And, as its name implies,
it is the ratio of the angular

00:27:04.905 --> 00:27:09.186
momentum to the magnetic moment
for the electron.

00:27:09.186 --> 00:27:14.270
This is our conversion factor
to go back and forth between

00:27:14.270 --> 00:27:17.481
angular momentum and magnetic
moment.

00:27:17.481 --> 00:27:21.762
And that factor is the
gyromagnetic ratio for the

00:27:21.762 --> 00:27:24.972
electron.
You will see this as gamma,

00:27:24.972 --> 00:27:28.183
sometimes.
And, for the free electron

00:27:28.183 --> 00:27:33.000
value, it is a number very close
to two.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:37.833
And so, if you think about
different ions that could be at

00:27:37.833 --> 00:27:41.903
the center of a coordination
complex, you wonder,

00:27:41.903 --> 00:27:46.143
well, what are my possible
values for the spin-only

00:27:46.143 --> 00:27:49.619
magnetic moment,
as given by this formula?

00:27:49.619 --> 00:27:52.502
Well, we can make a table for
that.

00:27:52.502 --> 00:27:56.657
We have the number of electrons
that are unpaired,

00:27:56.657 --> 00:27:59.795
remember.
And then, we will be able to

00:27:59.795 --> 00:28:04.976
calculate S.
And then we will want to get

00:28:04.976 --> 00:28:10.929
mu, which is this spin-only
value calculated according to

00:28:10.929 --> 00:28:15.393
that formula.
And ions from the part of the

00:28:15.393 --> 00:28:21.346
Periodic Table that we may
consider working with can have

00:28:21.346 --> 00:28:24.748
one, two, three,
four, five, six,

00:28:24.748 --> 00:28:30.096
up to seven unpaired electrons.
These numbers,

00:28:30.096 --> 00:28:33.622
like six and seven,
are more important for the

00:28:33.622 --> 00:28:38.244
lanthanide ions in systems with
f-electrons than for systems

00:28:38.244 --> 00:28:40.907
with d electrons.
But, nonetheless,

00:28:40.907 --> 00:28:44.746
we can easily make these
predictions the same way.

00:28:44.746 --> 00:28:48.115
And so S would be one-half for
one electron,

00:28:48.115 --> 00:28:51.953
one, then three-halves,
then two for four unpaired

00:28:51.953 --> 00:28:56.262
electrons, then five-halves for
five unpaired electrons,

00:28:56.262 --> 00:29:00.179
then three, and then
seven-halves finally for seven

00:29:00.179 --> 00:29:06.660
unpaired electrons.
And if you put this into this

00:29:06.660 --> 00:29:13.349
formula, you would see that for
one unpaired electron,

00:29:13.349 --> 00:29:20.291
it would be one-half times
one-half plus one square root

00:29:20.291 --> 00:29:25.087
times two.
That would be square root of

00:29:25.087 --> 00:29:31.776
three, so this would be a
spin-only magnetic moment of

00:29:31.776 --> 00:29:35.689
1.73.
And then for S equals one,

00:29:35.689 --> 00:29:42.000
we actually have a value of
about 2.83.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:48.785
And then for three unpaired
electrons, we have a value of,

00:29:48.785 --> 00:29:55.333
let's say approximately 3.87.
And then for S equals two,

00:29:55.333 --> 00:30:02.000
or four unpaired electrons,
we have a value of 4.90.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:06.173
For the spin-only magnetic
moment, if you go through with

00:30:06.173 --> 00:30:09.378
these values of S,
these numbers of unpaired

00:30:09.378 --> 00:30:12.136
electrons.
Let's just make sure we are

00:30:12.136 --> 00:30:14.000
very clear on that.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:26.058
And then 5.92,
6.93, 7.94 approximately.

00:30:26.058 --> 00:30:34.446
You can check those numbers,
but they are approximately

00:30:34.446 --> 00:30:38.416
right.
And in each case what you are

00:30:38.416 --> 00:30:42.583
seeing is the spin-only
prediction for the magnetic

00:30:42.583 --> 00:30:46.250
moment is always,
in units of Bohr magnetons,

00:30:46.250 --> 00:30:51.250
a little less than one plus the
number of unpaired electrons.

00:30:51.250 --> 00:30:55.166
It is not like you have four
unpaired electrons,

00:30:55.166 --> 00:31:00.000
so your spin-only magnetic
moment is around four.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:03.799
It is actually a little less
than five.

00:31:03.799 --> 00:31:08.799
And that is because of the
quantum mechanics of the

00:31:08.799 --> 00:31:15.000
electron spin angular momentum.
And this kind of consideration,

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:20.200
here, leads you into thinking
about what happens with

00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:25.200
different d^n counts for a
particular type of metal

00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:27.000
complex.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:40.487
This means that we are going to
attack and address the high

00:31:40.487 --> 00:31:44.000
spin/low spin problem.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:59.257
These systems are not so
terribly difficult,

00:31:59.257 --> 00:32:01.000
but let's face it;
--

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:04.903
-- once you have been presented
with a particular coordination

00:32:04.903 --> 00:32:07.720
complex, and you think you know
the geometry,

00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:11.432
and you think you know the d
orbital splitting diagram that

00:32:11.432 --> 00:32:15.271
corresponds to that geometry,
and you think you know how many

00:32:15.271 --> 00:32:18.471
d electrons go into that
diagram, there is one more

00:32:18.471 --> 00:32:20.776
thing.
And that is sometimes you have

00:32:20.776 --> 00:32:25.000
to figure out if it is high spin
or if it is low spin.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:29.537
And what that means is for a
particular d^n count,

00:32:29.537 --> 00:32:33.703
there might be two possible
choices over here,

00:32:33.703 --> 00:32:38.333
depending on how the electrons
occupy the orbitals.

00:32:38.333 --> 00:32:41.944
And so let's look at an example
of this.

00:32:41.944 --> 00:32:46.203
Here is energy.
Again, we are really focusing a

00:32:46.203 --> 00:32:51.759
lot on energy level diagrams.
Sometimes we focus on molecular

00:32:51.759 --> 00:32:56.203
orbital diagrams.
Right now, we are using these d

00:32:56.203 --> 00:33:03.000
orbital splitting diagrams.
And I will give you an example

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:07.799
that is octahedral.
And this is a species that we

00:33:07.799 --> 00:33:12.200
looked at in a recent
demonstration in class,

00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:18.099
which is hexaaquo meaning six
waters around an iron two plus

00:33:18.099 --> 00:33:21.500
in an octahedral array.

00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:27.299
This will be our metal complex
for which we will draw the d

00:33:27.299 --> 00:33:33.996
orbital splitting diagram.
It is an octahedral complex,

00:33:33.996 --> 00:33:37.420
so we draw our diagram like
this.

00:33:37.420 --> 00:33:42.129
And of course,
we have t(2g) and e(g)* levels

00:33:42.129 --> 00:33:46.516
that we can populate with our d
electrons.

00:33:46.516 --> 00:33:52.723
And we are going to need to
figure out how many d electrons

00:33:52.723 --> 00:34:00.000
we have to put into this diagram
for the octahedral system.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:04.401
The oxidation state of the iron
here is +2.

00:34:04.401 --> 00:34:10.793
And you can tell that because
the way you tell oxidation state

00:34:10.793 --> 00:34:16.452
is to take into account both the
charge on the ligands.

00:34:16.452 --> 00:34:20.329
Chlorides, for example,
are minus one.

00:34:20.329 --> 00:34:26.302
Because water is a neutral
molecule, it is simply neutral.

00:34:26.302 --> 00:34:32.694
And then, you have to also take
into account the charge on the

00:34:32.694 --> 00:34:36.330
whole ion.
So this is iron two plus.

00:34:36.330 --> 00:34:38.325
The iron in the plus two

00:34:38.325 --> 00:34:40.543
oxidation state with six neutral
ligands.

00:34:40.543 --> 00:34:43.758
If I had six NH three
ligands in the same charge on

00:34:43.758 --> 00:34:46.917
the ion, then it would still be
iron plus two.

00:34:46.917 --> 00:34:50.243
And you are going to get some
practice figuring out oxidation

00:34:50.243 --> 00:34:53.292
state because if you cannot do
that correctly you cannot

00:34:53.292 --> 00:34:56.008
identify the number of d
electrons to put into the

00:34:56.008 --> 00:34:58.392
diagram correctly.
And this is iron plus two.

00:34:58.392 --> 00:35:02.843
You need to know that iron is

00:35:02.843 --> 00:35:05.980
in Group 8 of the periodic
table.

00:35:05.980 --> 00:35:11.568
The equation for number of d
electrons here is eight minus

00:35:11.568 --> 00:35:15.000
two equals six.
If it is in Group 8,

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:20.490
that means that an iron atom
has eight valance electrons,

00:35:20.490 --> 00:35:26.372
the same way that carbon has
four valance electrons or oxygen

00:35:26.372 --> 00:35:32.261
has six valance electrons.
And in Group 8 of the periodic

00:35:32.261 --> 00:35:36.860
table, we are subtracting two
from the eight valance electrons

00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:40.478
because there is a two plus
charge on the system.

00:35:40.478 --> 00:35:43.871
That leaves six valance
electrons on the iron.

00:35:43.871 --> 00:35:48.243
And that means this is what we
call a d six system.

00:35:48.243 --> 00:35:51.259
By convention,
we are considering all the

00:35:51.259 --> 00:35:55.254
valance electrons that remain
after the metal has been

00:35:55.254 --> 00:35:59.175
oxidized to plus two as d
electrons, meaning they are

00:35:59.175 --> 00:36:04.000
going to go into our d orbital
splitting diagram.

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:08.833
Now, the reason we do this,
in fact, is because in ions

00:36:08.833 --> 00:36:13.756
like this, the d orbitals are
the orbitals on the metal,

00:36:13.756 --> 00:36:17.515
on the iron,
that are the lowest in energy.

00:36:17.515 --> 00:36:22.259
After, in the case of iron,
iron has principle quantum

00:36:22.259 --> 00:36:26.197
number three.
There is also a 4s and a 4p set

00:36:26.197 --> 00:36:31.299
of orbitals available to iron,
but they are much higher in

00:36:31.299 --> 00:36:35.454
energy.
We are simplifying the system

00:36:35.454 --> 00:36:40.278
and just looking at what happens
with the five d orbitals,

00:36:40.278 --> 00:36:45.357
which are the lowest valance
energy orbitals available to the

00:36:45.357 --> 00:36:48.404
iron.
Just like a carbon has a 2s and

00:36:48.404 --> 00:36:53.059
a set of three 2p orbitals,
an iron has a set of five 3d

00:36:53.059 --> 00:36:56.191
orbitals, a 4s,
and three 4p orbitals.

00:36:56.191 --> 00:37:00.000
But those s and p ones are
higher.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:04.415
We are just focusing on our d
orbitals, here,

00:37:04.415 --> 00:37:10.034
using our d orbital only
splitting diagrams with which we

00:37:10.034 --> 00:37:14.650
have six electrons for
population of a diagram.

00:37:14.650 --> 00:37:20.671
And so what you see immediately
is you will identify with the

00:37:20.671 --> 00:37:26.591
notion that there are two ways
to populate this diagram with

00:37:26.591 --> 00:37:29.000
six electrons.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.000
Because we can do this.

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:42.535
Here, we are following Hund's
rule of maximum multiplicity,

00:37:42.535 --> 00:37:47.688
trying not to pair up any
electrons until we run out of

00:37:47.688 --> 00:37:50.838
spots for them,
and so we have to.

00:37:50.838 --> 00:37:54.655
There is one way to populate
the diagram.

00:37:54.655 --> 00:38:00.000
Two electrons in e(g)*.
Four electrons in t(2g).

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:04.166
One of them,
spin inverted relative to the

00:38:04.166 --> 00:38:10.060
other five because you cannot
put two electrons in the same

00:38:10.060 --> 00:38:14.126
orbital unless they have
different spins.

00:38:14.126 --> 00:38:18.394
And, finally,
we could populate the diagram

00:38:18.394 --> 00:38:22.459
this way.
The case on the left is what we

00:38:22.459 --> 00:38:25.000
call high spin.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:35.000
The case on the right is what
we call low spin.

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:44.559
And, as you think about it,
you will realize that the high

00:38:44.559 --> 00:38:49.039
spin/low spin problem only
arises for certain d^n counts.

00:38:49.039 --> 00:38:51.360
It doesn't arise,
for example,

00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:56.159
for d one because we
would just put one electron down

00:38:56.159 --> 00:39:00.000
here in t(2g) and that is not a
problem.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:04.032
And you will see that,
as you run through the d one

00:39:04.032 --> 00:39:07.580
all the way up to the d
ten.

00:39:07.580 --> 00:39:12.338
d^n counts can go from d^0 to
d^10, and that is the limit of

00:39:12.338 --> 00:39:15.403
the possibilities here.
Zero, one, two,

00:39:15.403 --> 00:39:17.741
three, four,
five, six, seven,

00:39:17.741 --> 00:39:19.354
eight, nine,
and ten.

00:39:19.354 --> 00:39:23.870
Here I have chosen a d^6 case
to illustrate the high spin

00:39:23.870 --> 00:39:28.225
versus low spin dichotomy.
And you might wonder when do

00:39:28.225 --> 00:39:32.636
you --
Well, let me get back to that

00:39:32.636 --> 00:39:36.363
in a moment.
And let me just say here that

00:39:36.363 --> 00:39:40.727
we have four unpaired electrons
in d^6 high spin.

00:39:40.727 --> 00:39:43.363
We have one,
two, three, four.

00:39:43.363 --> 00:39:46.636
That makes this an s equals two
case.

00:39:46.636 --> 00:39:50.000
And, over here,
we have s equals zero.

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:55.363
And so this one on the right,
this low spin case is s equals

00:39:55.363 --> 00:39:58.454
zero.
We would say that this is not

00:39:58.454 --> 00:40:03.149
paramagnetic.
It is going to be only

00:40:03.149 --> 00:40:07.350
diamagnetic.
It has no unpaired electrons to

00:40:07.350 --> 00:40:12.333
give it a magnetic moment
according to the spin-only

00:40:12.333 --> 00:40:15.752
formula that we looked at over
here.

00:40:15.752 --> 00:40:20.442
On the other hand,
over here, we have an s equals

00:40:20.442 --> 00:40:25.620
two state that predicts a
magnetic moment of 4.90 Bohr

00:40:25.620 --> 00:40:28.454
magnetons.
And experimentally,

00:40:28.454 --> 00:40:35.000
mu was found for this system to
be 5.1 Bohr magnetons.

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:40.022
So we say this one turned out
to be high spin.

00:40:40.022 --> 00:40:45.714
And in a little while,
we will be talking more about

00:40:45.714 --> 00:40:52.410
what are the physical factors
that determine whether a system

00:40:52.410 --> 00:40:58.549
is low spin or high spin.
Remember, we have this delta O

00:40:58.549 --> 00:41:02.430
here.
And there is not one value for

00:41:02.430 --> 00:41:07.615
delta O, and this is something I
am going to emphasize again in a

00:41:07.615 --> 00:41:10.532
moment.
Delta O varies according to a

00:41:10.532 --> 00:41:14.340
number of factors,
and these factors include the

00:41:14.340 --> 00:41:19.201
specific nature of the ligands.
It includes the charge on the

00:41:19.201 --> 00:41:22.685
metal center.
It includes the specific metal

00:41:22.685 --> 00:41:25.682
that you are using.
And at some point,

00:41:25.682 --> 00:41:30.381
if delta O gets bigger and
bigger and bigger and bigger and

00:41:30.381 --> 00:41:35.000
exceeds what we call the pairing
energy --

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:50.176
This pairing energy is
something I will talk more about

00:41:50.176 --> 00:41:53.647
later, but it is the energy
required to put two electrons in

00:41:53.647 --> 00:41:55.000
the same d orbital.

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:15.951
If you get to a condition where
delta O is greater than this

00:42:15.951 --> 00:42:20.995
pairing energy,
in other words,

00:42:20.995 --> 00:42:25.837
there is a big splitting
between t(2g) and e(g)*,

00:42:25.837 --> 00:42:31.587
then the electrons will prefer
to pair up down here in the

00:42:31.587 --> 00:42:35.236
t(2g).
Whereas, if you think of it

00:42:35.236 --> 00:42:39.294
going to the limit of an
infinitely small delta O,

00:42:39.294 --> 00:42:44.015
they would have S equals two
because the gap between t(2g)

00:42:44.015 --> 00:42:47.576
and e(g)* in the limit of
vanishing delta O,

00:42:47.576 --> 00:42:51.055
for example,
when ligands go to an infinite

00:42:51.055 --> 00:42:55.361
distance away from the metal
center, they would then,

00:42:55.361 --> 00:43:00.000
in that limit,
have all five the same energy.

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:03.886
And so your S would naturally
equal two.

00:43:03.886 --> 00:43:09.665
If delta O is much greater than
the pairing energy giving a

00:43:09.665 --> 00:43:14.548
large value of delta O,
then that favors low spin.

00:43:14.548 --> 00:43:20.327
Factors that give rise to large
values of delta O favor low

00:43:20.327 --> 00:43:26.306
spin, and I will talk about a
few more factors like that in a

00:43:26.306 --> 00:43:28.000
moment.

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:40.714
Here is a brief introduction to
the magnetic properties of

00:43:40.714 --> 00:43:45.097
coordination complexes.
And I want to show that we can

00:43:45.097 --> 00:43:49.812
use the same types of diagrams
to talk about the colors of

00:43:49.812 --> 00:43:54.443
transition metal complexes.
We looked at the color change

00:43:54.443 --> 00:43:58.000
in that demonstration I showed
you.

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:02.332
And one of the really
fascinating aspects of

00:44:02.332 --> 00:44:08.477
transition metal chemistry is
the colors that arise because of

00:44:08.477 --> 00:44:13.817
absorption of a photon
coincident with promotion of an

00:44:13.817 --> 00:44:19.861
electron from t(2g) to e(g)*.
And so we will talk briefly now

00:44:19.861 --> 00:44:25.000
about electronic / absorption
spectroscopy.

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:48.243
And the most important thing I
want to impart to you here is a

00:44:48.243 --> 00:44:55.000
selection rule wherein delta S
is equal to zero.

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:02.000
This is the spin selection
rule.

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:14.618
And this means that when a
photon comes in and interacts

00:45:14.618 --> 00:45:19.488
with d electrons in a system of
the type we are discussing,

00:45:19.488 --> 00:45:24.358
that photon can be absorbed
coincident with promotion of an

00:45:24.358 --> 00:45:29.229
electron from t(2g) to e(g)*,
as long as it doesn't violate

00:45:29.229 --> 00:45:34.628
this spin selection rule.
And that means that the number

00:45:34.628 --> 00:45:39.885
of unpaired electrons should be
the same in the system before

00:45:39.885 --> 00:45:43.214
the photon is taken up,
as it is after.

00:45:43.214 --> 00:45:47.682
And so here is an example of
that, a simple example.

00:45:47.682 --> 00:45:52.851
Here is an octahedral system,
titanium with six waters and a

00:45:52.851 --> 00:45:56.093
three plus charge.

00:45:56.093 --> 00:46:01.000
Titanium is in Group 4 of the
periodic table.

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:05.017
Our water ligands are neutral,
with three plus charges to be

00:46:05.017 --> 00:46:07.876
subtracted from four.
We have a d^1 system.

00:46:07.876 --> 00:46:11.280
This is one of the simplest
cases for talking about

00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:14.685
electronic absorption
spectroscopy and is the first

00:46:14.685 --> 00:46:17.476
thing that you encounter in your
textbook.

00:46:17.476 --> 00:46:21.697
By the way, let me just remind
you that right now you should be

00:46:21.697 --> 00:46:25.170
reading Chapter 16 in your
textbook, that deals with

00:46:25.170 --> 00:46:28.846
coordination chemistry,
electronic structure of d-block

00:46:28.846 --> 00:46:33.000
elements, colors and magnetism,
and so forth.

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:38.728
And the ground state,
here, is one in which t(2g) has

00:46:38.728 --> 00:46:45.338
a single electron in it for this
d^1 ion and e(g)* is vacant.

00:46:45.338 --> 00:46:50.737
And, if that system,
in the case of titanium three

00:46:50.737 --> 00:46:55.805
aquo in aqueous solution,
is a pale blue color,

00:46:55.805 --> 00:47:01.501
a pretty pale blue --
If a photon comes in of the

00:47:01.501 --> 00:47:07.152
appropriate energy delta O to
promote the electron into e(g)*,

00:47:07.152 --> 00:47:12.155
then that transforms this
system into an excited state,

00:47:12.155 --> 00:47:16.787
as follows, with a
configuration (t two g) zero and

00:47:16.787 --> 00:47:19.937
(e g star) one.

00:47:19.937 --> 00:47:24.198
These diagrams,
just like the molecular orbital

00:47:24.198 --> 00:47:28.275
diagrams we developed for
diatomic molecules,

00:47:28.275 --> 00:47:33.000
can be associated with
configurations.

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:38.645
And this transition can be
written as( t two g) one (e g

00:47:38.645 --> 00:47:44.701
star) zero,
photon in, electron promoted

00:47:44.701 --> 00:47:50.142
into e g star,
t two g zero and e g star one

00:47:50.142 --> 00:47:55.377
now corresponding
to the excited

00:47:55.377 --> 00:47:58.559
state.
And this excited state is

00:47:58.559 --> 00:48:04.000
produced in a vibrationally
excited manner.

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:08.462
And it and the ground state
interact with the environment in

00:48:08.462 --> 00:48:11.411
different ways,
such that the absorption

00:48:11.411 --> 00:48:15.949
spectrum for a system of this
type gives rise to not a sharp,

00:48:15.949 --> 00:48:18.218
but a broad peak.
And, in fact,

00:48:18.218 --> 00:48:21.470
the spectrum would look
something like this.

00:48:21.470 --> 00:48:24.949
Going from 200 to 700
nanometers in wavelength,

00:48:24.949 --> 00:48:28.882
you would see a profile like
this with one broad peak

00:48:28.882 --> 00:48:32.588
somewhere in the red,
such that we would be behind

00:48:32.588 --> 00:48:36.899
the pale blue color of these
solutions of aqueous titanium

00:48:36.899 --> 00:48:42.289
three. So this 
would be an absorption

00:48:42.289 --> 00:48:45.571
spectrum, and this is
wavelength, down here.

00:48:45.571 --> 00:48:49.921
And this is the peak for what
we call this d-d transition,

00:48:49.921 --> 00:48:53.814
from t(2g) to e(g)*.
There are a lot more subtleties

00:48:53.814 --> 00:48:57.325
on this, which is where I will
begin on Monday.

00:48:57.325 --> 00:48:58.725
Have a great weekend.
