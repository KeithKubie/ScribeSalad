00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:06.210
It’s been a dramatic night: you were in
a hotel at a crossroads; the tide was coming

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.520
in; someone threw a pencil at you; you were
in the back of a big car with your grandmother,

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:18.069
on the way to sit an exam; you had to climb
over a wall but kept being tickled by a giant

00:00:18.069 --> 00:00:24.349
squirrel. Then you woke up. It felt immensely
important, but when you go downstairs and

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:29.529
try to tell your companions about the extraordinary
things that travelled through your sleeping

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:35.109
brain, the results are sobering. You keep
saying that it felt ‘exciting’, ‘so

00:00:35.109 --> 00:00:40.190
weird’ and ‘absolutely amazing’, but
– strangely – your attempts to get others

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:45.679
to experience the particularities of your
night are met by some dispiritingly blank

00:00:45.679 --> 00:00:51.690
stares. Half-way through the narration, someone
pipes up to say the cereal is running low.

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.670
Another person mentions it might rain later.
Then the doorbell rings. It’s a poignant

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:03.420
impasse, but not an untypical one either.
It’s tempting to think the problem has to

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.600
do with dreams themselves – because they
are so odd, unique and specific to us. But

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.780
the difficulty isn’t limited to dreams:
it’s a general problem of existence, which

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:20.130
can just as well strike when we try to explain
how our holiday was, what we feel about our

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:26.000
childhood or our ideas about how society should
be run. Much about our lives is like a very

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.540
intensely-felt dream we can’t quite get
others to listen to properly. The reason is

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:38.299
to a striking extent down to a collective
lack of preparation, an insufficient sense

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:43.859
that what we’re trying to do is really very
hard and therefore will require a high degree

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:50.759
of skill and practice. We naively assume that
enthusiasm and authenticity can be enough;

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:56.399
and that if we feel something to be important
or beautiful, it will inevitably and immediately

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:03.530
strike others as being so as well. This charming,
though ultimately lonely, egocentricity can

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.740
be best seen in children who are among the
worst story tellers, because they have a touchingly

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:14.890
weak hold on a very painful idea: that other
people are liable to be in different places

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:21.080
from us internally and are highly unlikely
to understand, feel and see as we do unless

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.740
we go to considerable lengths to extract,
arrange and systematically package up the

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:35.810
contents of our minds for them. These are
some of the rules for storytelling: – firstly,

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:41.250
we know what we mean far earlier than anyone
else can and so we must understand a story

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.990
at least five times as well when it is to
be shared in company as when it is merely

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:52.330
left to marinade in our own brains. – secondly,
keeping a story brief takes far more effort

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:57.890
than letting it expand. The philosopher Pascal
once touchingly apologised to a friend for

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.150
the length of a letter he had written him.
As he admitted: ‘I’m sorry I didn’t

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:08.340
have time to make it shorter.’ – thirdly,
we need to simplify. The downfall of almost

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:14.080
all anecdotes is an accumulation of incidental
detail untethered to the underlying logic

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:19.650
of the story. If one is explaining how it
felt to see one’s grandmother, it is irrelevant

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.430
(and a waste of someone else’s rather precious
life) to say what time one left the house

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.460
and what the weather happened to be like.
We need a view of the branches, not of every

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:35.490
leaf. – fourthly, factual events (dates,
times, actions) are always less interesting

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:41.230
(though far easier to remember) than feelings
– and yet it’s the feelings that invariably

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:47.180
contain the kernel of what can intrigue others.
It’s how we feel about what happened, not

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.130
merely what happened, that counts. Most of
what comes out of our mouths is more or less

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:51.130
unsocialised, in the sense of not quite fit
for the consumption of the world and a legacy

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:52.130
of environments that sentimentally set the
bar of successful communication far too low.

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:55.820
Those who grow up to speak clearly are those
especially alive to the risk and the tragedy

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:02.270
of being misunderstood. The contents of our
minds, and even of our dreams, are never really

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:08.460
too strange or boring for others to understand:
it’s just that our culture hasn’t yet

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:15.540
taken seriously enough the bracing challenges
of narrating the real substance of our complex

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.200
days and nights to other people.
