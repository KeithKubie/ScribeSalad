00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:15.220
 I'm with you I'm a cannabis grower 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.640
 I specialized in marijuana and everything 

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:20.180
 I had to see around 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:24.890
 from how to change a 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:27.920
 how to use a varietal line and 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:29.300
 7 years ago I was imprisoned for fewer plants 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:32.860
 of which today one can have 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.860
 legally in uruguay 

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:54.570
 [Music] 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:55.890
 for growing cannabis for me consumption 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.050
 personal 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.270
 he considered that it was worse than a 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.460
 drug dealer because I had the 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.620
 knowledge and the ability to produce 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:08.150
 a substance of very good quality I 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:08.150
 gave two years and four months 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.259
 when you enter the module and form 

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:18.270
 the cops that are going to give you your 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:22.110
 welcome is a line of 10 policemen 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:25.330
 on each side to his stick and a dog give you 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:28.210
 They are many seconds that you do not forget 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:31.510
 [Music] 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:34.330
 several days of visit all these people are going 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:37.360
 to visit your loved ones visit 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:41.530
 It has two parts when the guard 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:44.770
 call and say your visit came and then the 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:48.150
 Upset when the visit goes away I think 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.150
 that are the worst 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:02:09.840
 [Music] 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.849
 we were watching a movie with the 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.580
 guys and they kicked the door for us 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:16.940
 it was the violence with which he entered 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:20.040
 It was very mobilizing and a very abrupt 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.810
 but here we were, I have a picture in the 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:25.110
 phone is still secret from juan del 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:28.620
 2006 when he wore a beard 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:32.130
 now it's a series of hours put in 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:34.260
 the family the shoulder and not only looked after 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.720
 the family but taking care of me 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.360
 in also but one does not have its 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:42.300
 ground wire and where to return 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.690
 and his life project to follow is not 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.690
 misses 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:50.690
 the prisons are formators of 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.760
 delinquents 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.010
 in that period it was a study a lot 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.280
 of course I had much more time was a 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.280
 weirdo 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:06.280
 my apprenticeships in prison good 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:10.030
 they were botany the books laws because 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:13.330
 you had to shred all that stuff 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.470
 legal written in a language that is not 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:17.850
 that is not understood to tests so 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:22.050
 complicated for an ordinary person 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:24.440
 I am 40 years old and about carry this and if 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:27.390
 I would have had 20 that had happened to me 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:30.390
 the next prisoner grower may have 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:33.150
 those 20 years and your life will be shattered 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:35.790
 here I think that was what I 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:38.750
 motivated to leave jail with many 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.750
 forces to fight 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:51.810
 in Uruguay, consumption and 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:53.909
 have a small amount but there was not 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.799
 a lawful way to get that 

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:58.470
 quantity and if you buy it from a 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:04:00.780
 trafficker was not punishable self-produced 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:02.610
 had taken me there then it was 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:06.209
 illogical because that amount of carriage 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:08.250
 legal the law itself forced to buy it 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:10.319
 to a trafficker then justice 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:13.260
 he was in collusion with the 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:15.209
 drug trafficking when we arrived at 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.280
 raise that to the supreme court that 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:19.979
 we made a march towards the supreme 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:22.289
 cut and deliver our sailer thesis 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:26.320
 völler the spokesman of the supreme court 

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:29.500
 raúl oxandabarat and said 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:32.770
 the law has gaps and they started there 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:35.170
 drop everything like dominoes the 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:37.480
 legislators took that and they went to 

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:39.760
 talk to activists if you were going to 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:43.920
 change the law if you were going to refute a 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.920
 good article and that's where we started 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:50.100
 29 senators 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:52.140
 and they have done it for the affirmative and 13 and 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:54.510
 they have done it because of the refusal 

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:56.740
 tried in general the bill the 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:05:03.260
 Senate enters the discussion 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:15.060

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:15.060
 [Music] 

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:24.290
 marijuana moves a lot of money 

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:26.960
 around 50 million dollars 

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:29.420
 a year for the world very little but 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:32.660
 for Uruguay quite a lot if we 

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:35.480
 we took the eye drug trafficking if it were a 

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:39.170
 single company any company to which 

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:42.550
 you take 50 million dollars from 

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:45.550
 your cash flow has consequences a 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:45.550
 optional 

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:54.790
 [Music] 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:57.650
 the heels are thrown and this is where 

00:05:54.790 --> 00:06:00.320
 we make the first selection 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:03.110
 the psychoactive substance that we 

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:05.960
 We are looking for is located in the plant 

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:09.050
 glandular level does not run like a sap 

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:12.860
 they have a little body like a scion that 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:15.440
 he holds a head and his head is 

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:17.800
 filled with an oil that are the 

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:17.800
 cannabinoids 

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:23.580
 when for this for this harvest the 

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:25.230
 club is 100 at least head and 

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:29.600
 Juan's responsibility with our hand 

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:29.600
 of work not only learning

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:12.880
 the first time that in Uruguay a 

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:15.810
 exhibition of all items of the 

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:15.810
 cannabis 

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:24.480

 holland a barcelona 

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:35.970

 this has no turning back the world 

00:07:51.949 --> 00:07:59.469
 goes to that road I alone in Uruguay 

00:07:56.409 --> 00:08:03.129
 when we visualize this and we 

00:07:59.469 --> 00:08:05.349
 we put to work in the realization was 

00:08:03.129 --> 00:08:07.689
 a mountain that we had to climb 

00:08:05.349 --> 00:08:09.249
 when we reached the top we were going to 

00:08:07.689 --> 00:08:11.199
 hug we were going to plant the flag 

00:08:09.249 --> 00:08:13.689
 We were going to put on some concerts 

00:08:11.199 --> 00:08:16.360
 happy because marijuana was going to be 

00:08:13.689 --> 00:08:19.300
 legalized we reached the summit of the 

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:21.159
 mountain with the average flag reality and 

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:23.429
 when we looked there was a valley another 

00:08:21.159 --> 00:08:23.429
 Montana 

00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:40.569
