really fast two guys only a month month
and a half to do and we'll see how it

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980
and a half to do and we'll see how it
 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.590
and a half to do and we'll see how it
works alright that's great let's take a

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600
works alright that's great let's take a
 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.479
works alright that's great let's take a
look at the demo yeah absolutely so

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489
look at the demo yeah absolutely so
 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:53.610

had to use three four five tools to just
 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.509
had to use three four five tools to just
send and complete a duck so that's why

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:57.519
send and complete a duck so that's why
 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:02:59.820
send and complete a duck so that's why
we decided to build penna doc and i'll

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830
we decided to build penna doc and i'll
 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:01.199
we decided to build penna doc and i'll
show you how easy it is to send a

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209
show you how easy it is to send a
 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:03.210
