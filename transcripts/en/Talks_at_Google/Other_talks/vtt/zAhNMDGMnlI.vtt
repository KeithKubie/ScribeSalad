00:00:01.744 --> 00:00:03.290
JUSTIN: I wanted
to introduce John.

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:05.780
We have a great astronomy
focused talk today.

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:08.700
John Bochanski, a professor
of physics at Rider University

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.290
is joining us.

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.230
He'll discuss how large digital
surveys of the night sky

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.190
have revolutionized
how astronomy is done.

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:17.840
He will also explore
the motivation

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.710
behind large surveys,
detail some of his results,

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:23.450
and discuss the
data rich feature

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:25.800
of large astronomical surveys.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.230
John most recently discovered
the two most distant stars

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:33.940
in our galaxy, over one
million light-years away.

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.530
So in addition to
being a professor,

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:38.910
John is a blogger at
"Sky and Telescope",

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.800
a prominent magazine
for astronomers,

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.310
and expecting his first
child in March, as well.

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:46.040
So congratulations.

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.910
He's also a very
close friend of mine

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.480
and an all-around amazing guy.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.470
So just please give a
warm welcome to Professor

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:53.094
John Bochanski.

00:00:54.076 --> 00:00:55.465
JOHN BOCHANKSI: Thank you.

00:00:55.465 --> 00:00:57.317
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:59.120
Thank you, Justin.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.500
And thanks to all of
you for coming out

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.489
to listen a little bit about
some of the surveys that

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.350
are really shaping the
future of astronomy.

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.550
And for those of you who
have been in the room

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:12.950
for a few minutes,
you've seen the video

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.620
that's playing in the
background for my title slide.

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.830
That was put together by folks
at Johns Hopkins University

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.510
and the Adler
Planetarium in Chicago.

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:23.730
It uses data on galaxies.

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:27.130
This is a map of the
universe at the scale

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.710
of about a billion light-years--
one of the more detailed maps

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.640
of the universe that
has ever been produced.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.130
And that's really what I'm
going to focus on a lot today,

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.680
is one of the essential
jobs of astronomers,

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.360
for almost as long as
astronomers have been around,

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.220
they've been trying
to make maps.

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.410
So they've looked at
images like this one,

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:54.540
seen the Milky Way galaxy
splayed across the sky,

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.730
and tried to map out the
stars and the dust that

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:01.570
are shown in this
image, and tried

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.170
to make sense of the
physical structure that

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:06.460
makes up our galaxy.

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.293
And that's what I'm
going to focus on today.

00:02:08.293 --> 00:02:11.760
Most of my research is focused
on mapping our own Milky Way

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:12.800
galaxy.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.890
And so we're going to
be talking about scales

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.810
of about a million
light-years or so.

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.800
One of the first astronomically
correct maps of the Milky Way

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.200
was produced by Thomas Wright.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.830
This was in the mid-1700s.

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.140
He was one of the
first to really begin

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.030
to suss out the details in
terms of the physical structure

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.470
of our galaxy.

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.360
It was no longer
just a uniform sphere

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.910
that was perfect in every
dimension and direction.

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.100
Instead, he was
able to figure out

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.550
that it was a flattened system.

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.690
And William Herschel,
who actually usually gets

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.430
the credit for first coming up
with a map of the Milky Way,

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.070
used one of the largest
telescopes at the time

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:59.130
to conduct a survey
of the night sky

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.790
and inferred this distribution,
with the sun somewhere

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.170
in the center here, and
found that the Milky

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.910
Way was a flattened
disk structure.

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.560
And this kind of work has
gone on from the 1700s, when

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.910
the first modern
maps of the Milky Way

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.550
were really produced,
to the present day.

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:21.120
And so I want to tell you
the story behind my own work

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.390
and how I produced one of
these maps along the way.

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.720
My story starts not far from
where this image was taken.

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.680
So this is Ocean
City, New Jersey.

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.580
I grew up about an
hour away from where

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.260
this image was taken.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.532
And that's kind of what
the night sky looked like.

00:03:36.532 --> 00:03:38.490
You could see some bright
stars, but you really

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:41.190
couldn't see a
whole lot of detail.

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:44.660
And it wasn't until I traveled
to this place, Kitt Peak

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:47.560
National Observatory, just
outside Tucson, Arizona,

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.960
as part of a summer internship,
and used this telescope

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:52.460
right here.

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:55.720
We were in the middle
of a long observation.

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.940
And so I was able to go
outside, take a long look

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:04.260
at the night sky,
and saw an image

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.765
that looks a lot like this.

00:04:06.765 --> 00:04:08.640
And the other thing I
want to point out, too,

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.900
the telescope in
the upper right,

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.976
we'll be naming that later.

00:04:12.976 --> 00:04:14.350
Is there anybody
in the room that

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:16.765
thinks they know what
telescope that is?

00:04:16.765 --> 00:04:17.973
AUDIENCE: Dark Energy Survey?

00:04:17.973 --> 00:04:20.120
No, unfortunately.

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.460
So that, I would
argue, is probably

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.760
one of the most
important telescopes that

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.740
has ever been around, but
no one knows its name.

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:29.542
But you will by the
end of the talk.

00:04:29.542 --> 00:04:31.000
AUDIENCE: Sloan
Digital Sky Survey?

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.000
JOHN BOCHANKSI: Oh, yes.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.420
Thank you.

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:36.630
So I looked up at the night
sky, saw the Milky Way

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:39.130
for the first time, and
was immediately enthralled.

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:42.650
I wanted to know how
the galaxy came to be,

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:47.440
how it's evolved over the last
tens of billions of years,

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.630
and really why it was
shaped the way that it was.

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:54.610
And so fast forward
10 years later,

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.530
and I was taking data
that actually mapped

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:01.550
out and produced one of the more
precise maps of our Milky Way

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:05.350
that's been produced to date.

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:07.010
And so I know many
of you in the room

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:11.349
probably are not up on
your astronomical jargon.

00:05:11.349 --> 00:05:13.640
So I'm going to try and keep
it to an absolute minimum.

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:16.510
But there's a few things
that you need to know.

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:19.260
So the first thing
is that the parsec

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.950
is the basic unit of distance
that most astronomers use.

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:27.080
And the reason that
it's named a parsec

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:32.260
is that it is the
angular shift that you

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:37.550
see for something that
is a distance away.

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:41.220
So an object that
is one parsec away

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:45.460
will have a parallactic angle
shift of one arc second.

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:49.580
The closest star to us is almost
right around a parsec away.

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:51.040
And so the way
this angular shift

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:53.620
works-- everyone in this
room is familiar with it--

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:57.040
if you hold your arm out,
or your finger out at arm's

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:59.090
length, and blink your
eyes back and forth,

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:01.970
you'll see your finger move
across distant background

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:03.000
objects.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.190
You bring your finger
closer to your nose,

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:08.320
and that shift becomes
greater and greater.

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:10.630
The same thing
happens with stars.

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:15.570
So a nearby star, shown in
blue here, if one eyeball

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:21.170
is in July-- you'd take an image
of that field of stars in July,

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:23.440
and that's like blinking
your eye back and forth--

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:27.160
you take the same image again
six months later in January,

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:30.060
and that nearby star
will appear to shift

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:33.700
its position with respect
to more distant stars.

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:37.390
And so that shift is known
as the parallactic angle.

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:41.070
It is a key distance indicator
for all of astronomy.

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:43.915
The reason that this is so
important and so fundamental--

00:06:43.915 --> 00:06:46.090
and I'll come back
to this a few times--

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:48.600
is that we can
measure the distance

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:51.530
to nearby stars
with no assumptions.

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:54.550
This is a purely
geometric measurement.

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:56.120
It's very hard to do.

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:59.540
So an arc second is an
extremely small angle.

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:04.390
Most stars have shifts that
are nearly 100 times smaller

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:05.650
than that.

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:07.780
And so the limit that
we can get out to

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:11.657
is something like 50 to
100 parsecs, currently.

00:07:11.657 --> 00:07:13.740
And so that means that
there's only a few hundred,

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:18.510
maybe about 1,000 stars, where
we can measure their distances

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:21.540
directly using this technique.

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:22.980
But they're very, very valuable.

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:25.670
They're what's known
as a fundamental

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:27.180
wrong on the distance ladder.

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:31.320
Because if we can get
the distance directly,

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:32.990
then we can calculate
something known

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:34.480
as the absolute magnitude.

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:37.820
So this is the only equation
that will appear in the talk.

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:40.900
If you have the apparent
magnitude of a star, which

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:43.640
is just what you would see
if you just measured it.

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:46.680
So it's saying that star is
bright, that star is faint.

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:49.350
If you have the
distance here, then

00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:53.020
you can calculate the absolute
magnitude of the star.

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:55.020
And why that's important,
the absolute magnitude

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:58.357
is a tracer of the star's
fundamental properties.

00:07:58.357 --> 00:07:59.940
So if you know the
absolute magnitude,

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:02.020
you know something about
the size of the star,

00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:05.680
you know something
about its mass,

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:08.950
potentially about
its composition.

00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:11.240
And so it becomes
very, very valuable

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:15.310
to use these nearby stars
to calibrate relations

00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:20.650
between absolute magnitude
and other observables.

00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:25.480
And for those of you who are
up on your logarithm scales,

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:27.180
the absolute
magnitude is formally

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:30.200
defined as what the star's
apparent magnitude would

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:33.309
be at a distance of 10 parsecs.

00:08:33.309 --> 00:08:36.539
You plug in 10 here,
this side is zero.

00:08:36.539 --> 00:08:43.240
And so it places all stars on
the same fundamental scale.

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:47.030
And so if you don't
know the distance,

00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:50.480
if the star is beyond
our current capabilities

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:54.350
of measuring a
parallactic angle shift,

00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:56.290
then we need to use
the star's color

00:08:56.290 --> 00:08:59.290
to infer its absolute magnitude.

00:08:59.290 --> 00:09:01.290
And the way this is
done is with images

00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:03.690
like the one that's
being shown here.

00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:07.520
This is an image of
a cluster of stars

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:12.000
and it essentially-- I'll
step through and show you

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.210
how astronomers sort
this kind of image

00:09:16.210 --> 00:09:20.620
based on color and brightness,
or their intrinsic brightness,

00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:23.740
their absolute magnitude.

00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:28.460
So this image is actually
a little bit of a fake.

00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:30.490
So the images that we
get from the telescope

00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:33.420
don't actually appear in color.

00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:34.460
We use filters.

00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:37.820
And so the combination
of different filters

00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:40.640
give you the nice color
image that you see here.

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:43.650
And this was taken with
the Hubble Space Telescope.

00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:46.390
So astronomers will
use a blue filter

00:09:46.390 --> 00:09:52.160
and recover only the blue
light from a particular star,

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:55.550
a green filter that looks
at only the green part

00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:59.400
of the electromagnetic
spectrum, and a red filter

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:03.850
to produce the full color
image that you see here.

00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:06.350
And so you can see that,
depending on whether or not

00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:09.460
a star is intrinsically
red, like the one

00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:12.680
in the upper right hand part of
the diagram that contains quite

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:17.080
a lot of red light, or a
blue star like these two

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:21.440
here on the bottom-- let's
skip back just a little bit--

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:24.900
those intrinsically are
producing more blue light

00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:27.460
then the red stars that we see.

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:30.330
So the color of stars
actually gives us

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:32.670
a lot information
about the stars.

00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:36.820
And my wife may actually
disagree about this,

00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:40.690
but astronomers really like
to be orderly and organized.

00:10:40.690 --> 00:10:43.220
And so they always try
to sort things out.

00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:46.930
And so we like to put red
stars on the right, blue stars

00:10:46.930 --> 00:10:48.470
on the left.

00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:50.910
So we'll do that.

00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:53.470
And we also like to characterize
things by their brightness.

00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:56.220
And typically, the
intrinsically bright stars

00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:58.630
are placed on the
top of diagrams,

00:10:58.630 --> 00:11:03.030
and the intrinsically faint
stars are placed on the bottom.

00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:05.230
And so what this
diagram really is,

00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:07.570
it's known as a color
magnitude diagram.

00:11:07.570 --> 00:11:09.860
So on the x-axis,
we talk about color.

00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:13.580
We put blue stars on the
left, red stars on the right.

00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:16.380
And the magnitude, short
for absolute magnitude,

00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:18.910
we take stars that are
intrinsically bright,

00:11:18.910 --> 00:11:20.300
put them on the top.

00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:22.830
Intrinsically faint
stars are on the bottom.

00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:24.950
Most of the stars
fall along what's

00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:26.167
known as the Main Sequence.

00:11:26.167 --> 00:11:27.500
Our sun is on the Main Sequence.

00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:32.150
Our sun would be kind of towards
the top of the sequence here.

00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:36.560
The majority of stars are what's
known as Main Sequence Red

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:37.170
Dwarfs.

00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:39.030
They would fall in this region.

00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:41.980
And then there's pockets of
smaller, more intrinsic--

00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:45.024
or, excuse me, larger, more
intrinsically bright stars.

00:11:45.024 --> 00:11:46.440
Those are the stars
that you would

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:48.240
see at the top of the diagram.

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:49.850
They're known as red giants.

00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:53.470
And on the left, we have
blue horizontal branch stars.

00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:56.130
And this sequence really
led to the development

00:11:56.130 --> 00:11:59.120
of stellar evolution
theory in general.

00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:02.460
Stars don't evenly
populate this phase space.

00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:04.020
They fall along sequences.

00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:06.170
And so understanding
those sequences

00:12:06.170 --> 00:12:10.030
became an important part,
or very important subject,

00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:12.840
in the early 1900s.

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:15.730
So this is another version
of a color magnitude diagram.

00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:18.260
I want to show this just
to play some numbers

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:21.480
on the kind of stars that
we'll be dealing with.

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:24.574
And my own work
focuses on red stars.

00:12:24.574 --> 00:12:25.990
So we're talking
about things that

00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:30.350
are anywhere from about
4,000 Kelvin or cooler.

00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:33.230
Our own sun is
about 6,000 Kelvin.

00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:35.630
This is the sun here.

00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:38.470
And on the y-axis, we
have absolute magnitude

00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:40.120
and luminosity.

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:42.660
And so the stars that
are on the bottom part

00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:45.140
of the main sequence,
the cool red dwarfs,

00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:48.050
are putting out something
like 1/100th to 1/1000th

00:12:48.050 --> 00:12:51.120
of the light that
the sun produces.

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:53.850
And so they're extremely
difficult to see,

00:12:53.850 --> 00:12:57.350
even though they make
up 70% of all stars.

00:12:57.350 --> 00:12:59.740
So you need a telescope
to see these things.

00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:01.820
There's one red dwarf
that you can actually

00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:04.730
see with your naked eye, but
you can't see it from this area.

00:13:04.730 --> 00:13:07.010
You have to go way
into the desert

00:13:07.010 --> 00:13:09.295
and have extremely
dark sky conditions.

00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:16.780
The flip side, on the bright
upper part of the diagram,

00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:18.970
we're talking about giant stars.

00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:23.180
So they produce anywhere from
10,000 to 1 million times more

00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:25.630
light than the sun.

00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:27.830
And so what this means
for us is that if we want

00:13:27.830 --> 00:13:30.820
to map the nearby galaxy,
we're going to take the most

00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:35.270
numerous tracers, the red dwarfs
that make up 70% of all stars.

00:13:35.270 --> 00:13:38.900
There's hundreds of billions
of these in our own galaxy.

00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:42.030
And if we can determine accurate
distances for all these stars,

00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:45.370
then we have a very nice measure
of the density distribution

00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:47.540
of the galaxy.

00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:50.710
And using the same
survey data, we

00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:55.190
can look for the giants
that are producing

00:13:55.190 --> 00:13:58.600
millions of times more
light than our own sun.

00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:01.390
They can be seen at much,
much larger distances.

00:14:01.390 --> 00:14:03.950
And so they give
us the best shot

00:14:03.950 --> 00:14:06.880
at finding stars at very,
very large distances.

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:09.180
So I'm going to walk you
through a little bit of how

00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:13.740
we use these two types of stars
to map out the nearby parts

00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:17.920
of the galaxy and the really
distant parts, as well.

00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:20.950
So a little more Astronomy
101, the Milky Way galaxy

00:14:20.950 --> 00:14:21.890
is a spiral galaxy.

00:14:21.890 --> 00:14:24.730
It's a flattened disk system.

00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:26.790
We are about eight
kiloparsecs or so

00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:29.100
from the center of our galaxy.

00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:33.080
And we're essentially in
the disk of the galaxy.

00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:37.380
So that's why as you look
out in a dark night sky

00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:39.380
you see that band of stars.

00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:43.180
That's because
we're in that disk.

00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:47.060
The Galactic Center
itself is composed

00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:50.990
of older, redder stars.

00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:54.340
It appears yellow to the eye.

00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:57.280
There's also a lot
of gas and dust

00:14:57.280 --> 00:15:01.130
that's settled into the
disk of the Milky Way.

00:15:01.130 --> 00:15:03.520
As gas settles
down and cools, it

00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:07.810
begins to spark
new star formation.

00:15:07.810 --> 00:15:11.030
And so one of the best examples
of this is the Orion Nebula.

00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:13.130
It's a site of recent
star formation,

00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:16.900
and you can go out
tonight and see it.

00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:21.495
And so using survey data, we
can get a slightly nicer model

00:15:21.495 --> 00:15:22.890
of the Milky Way.

00:15:22.890 --> 00:15:27.510
So the sun would be somewhere
around 8,000 to 8,500 parsecs

00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:30.880
away from the center
of our galaxy.

00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:33.040
And it's composed
of two disks known

00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:34.930
as the thin and thick disk.

00:15:34.930 --> 00:15:37.137
They have different
structural properties.

00:15:37.137 --> 00:15:38.720
But essentially,
they make up the bulk

00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:42.010
of the stars that are along
the disk of our galaxy.

00:15:42.010 --> 00:15:43.730
This is not the
Milky Way, it's just

00:15:43.730 --> 00:15:47.680
an image of a galaxy that
looks similar to the Milky Way.

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:49.900
And as you get either
below or above the disk,

00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:52.120
you see fewer and fewer stars.

00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:54.550
But mapping out
exactly that fall off,

00:15:54.550 --> 00:15:56.550
either as you get away
from the Galactic Center,

00:15:56.550 --> 00:15:58.650
or as you go above
and below, tells you

00:15:58.650 --> 00:16:03.660
a lot about the composition and
the structure of our galaxy.

00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:07.310
And there's a sparse
halo of stars.

00:16:07.310 --> 00:16:11.390
So you're talking
about maybe 1% or so

00:16:11.390 --> 00:16:15.450
of the total number of
stars in our galaxy.

00:16:15.450 --> 00:16:17.130
But as you get further
and further away,

00:16:17.130 --> 00:16:21.180
it's the remnants of
Galactic formation.

00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:23.330
So our best picture
of Galactic formation

00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:27.150
is that smaller protogalaxies
were pulled together

00:16:27.150 --> 00:16:30.500
by mutual gravitation,
produced the Milky Way,

00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:35.800
and the leftover is what is
in a quasi-spherical shroud

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:37.680
around our galaxy.

00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:39.980
And that's actually one
of the more exciting areas

00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:42.260
of active research today.

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:44.840
But we can zoom in.

00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:48.600
And so for those of you
that have very good vision,

00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:52.110
and because we have fabulous
projectors here at Google,

00:16:52.110 --> 00:16:54.640
you may see a
tiny, tiny red dot.

00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:56.390
So that tiny red
dot is essentially

00:16:56.390 --> 00:16:58.820
the limit for the
nearby stars that we

00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:01.350
can measure good parallaxes to.

00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:04.460
It's known as the
solar neighborhood.

00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:07.190
It's the stars that we used
to calibrate all our distance

00:17:07.190 --> 00:17:11.300
relations, and it's great for
studying very faint objects.

00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:14.280
Because if it's a
faint object, you're

00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:17.410
not going to see it
at large distances.

00:17:17.410 --> 00:17:20.760
The downside to studying objects
in the solar neighborhood

00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:22.720
is that it's not actually
good for telling you

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:24.849
a lot about the structure
of the Milky Way.

00:17:24.849 --> 00:17:28.140
We're only probing a very,
very, very tiny volume.

00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:29.940
And so it's difficult
to really recover

00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:33.679
a lot of information
about our galaxy.

00:17:33.679 --> 00:17:34.970
Fortunately, there are surveys.

00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:38.290
And I'll tell you about the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey

00:17:38.290 --> 00:17:42.160
today, as well as two
that are on the horizon.

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:45.750
They probe somewhere around
a kiloparsec or so out

00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:46.910
into our Milky Way.

00:17:46.910 --> 00:17:48.930
And so, to date,
they've really given us

00:17:48.930 --> 00:17:53.670
the best picture that we have
of the structure of our galaxy

00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:56.900
at relatively large distances.

00:17:56.900 --> 00:17:59.770
The surveys that are
planned for the future

00:17:59.770 --> 00:18:03.500
are going to blow
Sloan out of the water.

00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:06.970
So we have surveys
that are about to start

00:18:06.970 --> 00:18:09.290
in the next decade
that will produce

00:18:09.290 --> 00:18:13.690
precise maps of our Milky Way
out to distances of around 10

00:18:13.690 --> 00:18:16.730
kiloparsecs or so.

00:18:16.730 --> 00:18:19.670
The survey that I want to spend
a little bit of time on today

00:18:19.670 --> 00:18:22.720
is known as the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey.

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:27.030
It started in 1998, actually the
same year that Google started.

00:18:27.030 --> 00:18:30.600
It's housed in the Apache Point
Observatory in New Mexico.

00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:33.060
And each clear night,
this entire structure

00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:39.720
would slide down the rail
and unveil this telescope.

00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:43.930
So this is arguably one of the
most important astronomical

00:18:43.930 --> 00:18:46.800
telescopes that's
ever been constructed.

00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:50.220
You can see two
people here to scale.

00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:52.670
The Sloan Digital
Sky Survey worked

00:18:52.670 --> 00:18:55.810
in a scanning mode
that made it very, very

00:18:55.810 --> 00:18:59.950
efficient to image large
parts of the sky continuously.

00:18:59.950 --> 00:19:03.150
And so essentially every
clear night since 1998,

00:19:03.150 --> 00:19:05.740
it's been imaging
the night sky using

00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:08.900
a relatively wide field of view.

00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:14.210
At the time of its construction,
the SDSS, the Sloan Digital Sky

00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:17.960
Survey, was home to the largest
digital camera ever made.

00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:22.030
It was about 120
megapixels and covered

00:19:22.030 --> 00:19:23.920
about 1 and 1/2 square degrees.

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:27.710
So it's about eight times
the area of the full moon.

00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:30.522
So it was a really
large field of view.

00:19:30.522 --> 00:19:31.980
And so it made it
great at covering

00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:35.660
wide areas of the sky
each and every night.

00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:39.650
And so you can see a person
behind the camera there, too.

00:19:39.650 --> 00:19:43.330
That's Jim Gunn, a
professor from Princeton.

00:19:43.330 --> 00:19:48.550
And Jim was really the
founder of the entire survey.

00:19:48.550 --> 00:19:50.390
So you can see, you
may be able to pick out

00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:53.860
some of the color differences
in the cameras there.

00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:55.340
And there were
multiple CCDs that

00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:57.850
made up the entire camera array.

00:19:57.850 --> 00:19:59.710
Well, those different
colors correspond

00:19:59.710 --> 00:20:02.040
to different filters.

00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:05.750
So the red, green, and blue that
I showed earlier in the talk

00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:07.600
is now split up into
five different filters,

00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:10.600
and that covers the
visual spectrum.

00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:15.000
So those five filters image
the night sky at the same time,

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.890
and it gave us a large amount
of information about the stars

00:20:18.890 --> 00:20:23.780
and galaxies that it
was imaging at the time.

00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:27.290
Sloan also recovered
something known as a spectrum.

00:20:27.290 --> 00:20:30.040
So you can think of a
spectrum as a detailed look

00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:34.650
into the light output
of an individual object.

00:20:34.650 --> 00:20:36.950
And so what I have
here are two spectra.

00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:40.960
One, shown in red,
corresponds to a red star.

00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:44.940
The other one shown in blue
corresponds to a blue star.

00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:47.200
Sloan not only imaged
the night sky--

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:53.470
so it's covered now over half
of the entire night sky--

00:20:53.470 --> 00:20:57.380
but it also took spectra
of millions of objects.

00:20:57.380 --> 00:21:01.700
Why this is important, this
spectrum, essentially you're

00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:04.230
taking the light, spreading
it out through a prism,

00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:07.340
and looking at the
detailed abundances of what

00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:09.310
makes up these
stars and galaxies.

00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:11.610
So this contains a
lot more information,

00:21:11.610 --> 00:21:17.580
but it's painstakingly tough
to make these observations.

00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:19.820
Sloan was actually pretty
efficient at doing this.

00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:22.700
And so the way they operated was
that they would image the night

00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:26.910
sky and then take
algorithms to target

00:21:26.910 --> 00:21:28.630
the most interesting
objects, the most

00:21:28.630 --> 00:21:31.080
interesting stars and galaxies.

00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:32.790
And at the University
of Washington,

00:21:32.790 --> 00:21:35.580
and the machine shop
down in the basement,

00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:37.230
plates would be
drilled that covered

00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:39.030
the entire field of view.

00:21:39.030 --> 00:21:40.940
And each of those
holes correspond

00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:43.990
to either an interesting
star, or a galaxy,

00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:47.720
or a distant quasar that
Sloan wanted to use to try

00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:53.300
and map out the distribution
of galaxies in the universe,

00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:56.130
or the distribution of
stars in the Milky Way.

00:21:56.130 --> 00:21:59.530
And it was able to go from
hundreds of millions of objects

00:21:59.530 --> 00:22:03.420
down to millions of
very interesting objects

00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:08.280
that we could get detailed
information about.

00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:10.890
And so the way this was done
was through fiber optics.

00:22:10.890 --> 00:22:17.500
There are 640 plugs, or
640 holes, on each plate.

00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:19.930
All of those needed
to be plugged by hand.

00:22:19.930 --> 00:22:23.220
And so there are some very
dedicated telescope operators

00:22:23.220 --> 00:22:25.190
down in New Mexico
that now all have

00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:26.900
carpal tunnel because
they've done this

00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:30.130
for a very long
time at this point.

00:22:30.130 --> 00:22:33.010
There's millions of
spectra that were recovered

00:22:33.010 --> 00:22:37.800
during the course of the survey.

00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:39.780
But really, what
it's led to, Sloan

00:22:39.780 --> 00:22:42.970
is arguably the most
efficient discovery engine

00:22:42.970 --> 00:22:45.230
that astronomy
has ever produced.

00:22:45.230 --> 00:22:47.210
The latest data release,
which actually just

00:22:47.210 --> 00:22:53.170
came out last week,
catalogs nearly 470 million

00:22:53.170 --> 00:22:54.910
different photometric
objects that

00:22:54.910 --> 00:23:00.690
have been imaged by the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey.

00:23:00.690 --> 00:23:06.520
60 million of those, and
probably more at this point,

00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:08.290
are these cool red dwarfs.

00:23:08.290 --> 00:23:11.730
So this is really where I
try and focus my research on,

00:23:11.730 --> 00:23:13.860
and try to use these
cool red dwarfs to map

00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:17.510
out the structure of the galaxy.

00:23:17.510 --> 00:23:21.250
And just over 4 million
spectra-- again,

00:23:21.250 --> 00:23:24.060
all those holes
have been plugged

00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:29.100
by hand-- have been
obtained mostly on galaxies.

00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:33.000
But there are at
least 70,000 stars

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:37.750
that we've identified
using the spectra.

00:23:37.750 --> 00:23:39.850
And probably, the
most exciting thing

00:23:39.850 --> 00:23:47.150
is that, since 1998, over 6,000
papers and 250,000 citations

00:23:47.150 --> 00:23:50.670
have been produced from this
small telescope in New Mexico.

00:23:50.670 --> 00:23:55.640
So that's really the hallmark
of the legacy of Sloan.

00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:59.320
And in the public
domain, Ann Finkbeiner

00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:02.760
wrote a very nice book titled
"A Grand and Bold Thing",

00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:05.690
detailing the history
and the politics that

00:24:05.690 --> 00:24:09.120
went into getting
Sloan up and running.

00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:12.390
And in 2008, Jim Gunn received
the Presidential Medal

00:24:12.390 --> 00:24:13.200
of Science.

00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:17.840
And so it is really a
testament to his work.

00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:19.920
And so now I want to
give you a little flavor.

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:23.700
I want to show you some of
the data, some raw images

00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:25.514
from the Sloan survey.

00:24:25.514 --> 00:24:27.180
And you're going to
see a few maps here.

00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:30.140
I just want to orient
your field of view.

00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:32.780
Astronomers love
Aitoff projection maps.

00:24:32.780 --> 00:24:36.530
So this is an Aitoff
projection of the earth.

00:24:36.530 --> 00:24:39.870
This is what the galaxy looks
like in Aitoff projection.

00:24:39.870 --> 00:24:42.840
So you can see the plane
of the Milky Way here,

00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:45.450
the large and small
magellanic clouds,

00:24:45.450 --> 00:24:48.490
and you can see that the
Galactic Center really

00:24:48.490 --> 00:24:52.890
is composed of yellow,
older stars as well

00:24:52.890 --> 00:24:58.270
as a lot of dust that's blocking
the light from the stars

00:24:58.270 --> 00:25:00.470
behind it.

00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:04.340
The Sloan sky coverage
looks something like this.

00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:08.100
This map should be updated, but
I haven't gotten around to it

00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:09.900
with the latest data release.

00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:13.750
Most of the data is contained
in the northern hemisphere

00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:15.360
of our galaxy.

00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:18.490
There are three stripes in
the southern hemisphere.

00:25:18.490 --> 00:25:20.830
And actually, a lot
of this area has

00:25:20.830 --> 00:25:26.690
been filled in in the
last five years or so.

00:25:26.690 --> 00:25:33.230
But it's imaged roughly about
half of the observable sky

00:25:33.230 --> 00:25:35.540
from New Mexico.

00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:38.590
And so to give you a sense
of just how many stars,

00:25:38.590 --> 00:25:41.317
you may be able to-- if you
squint your eyes a little bit,

00:25:41.317 --> 00:25:42.900
you can convince
yourself that, as you

00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:47.800
go from the pole of the Milky
Way down towards the equator,

00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:50.110
the spatial density
of stars increases.

00:25:50.110 --> 00:25:52.520
There's more stars
at lower latitudes.

00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:56.660
So that's the broad
brush structure

00:25:56.660 --> 00:25:57.870
that we're trying to measure.

00:25:57.870 --> 00:26:01.750
But we're going to do that in
a much more detailed fashion.

00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:05.300
And fortunately, there's
quite a large number of stars

00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:09.670
available to us when we use
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.

00:26:09.670 --> 00:26:12.170
So this is a movie
that I put together

00:26:12.170 --> 00:26:14.880
of one square degree of the sky.

00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:18.390
So the entire sky is 40,000
or so square degrees.

00:26:18.390 --> 00:26:21.680
This is a very tiny
footprint on the sky.

00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:24.390
And each successive
frame is highlighting

00:26:24.390 --> 00:26:29.190
the cool red dwarfs that are
in that small square degree.

00:26:29.190 --> 00:26:31.715
And so we use the colors
of all these stars

00:26:31.715 --> 00:26:34.250
to estimate their absolute
magnitudes, and then

00:26:34.250 --> 00:26:35.490
their distances.

00:26:35.490 --> 00:26:37.880
And each and every
one of these stars

00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:40.350
becomes a valuable
probe for measuring

00:26:40.350 --> 00:26:43.820
the density and the
structure of our Milky Way.

00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:47.420
And so we can take
that two degree image,

00:26:47.420 --> 00:26:49.380
associate a distance
with all those stars,

00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:51.640
and then put it into a
model of our Milky Way,

00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:53.060
and it looks
something like this.

00:26:53.060 --> 00:26:56.270
So this is a visualization put
together by some collaborators

00:26:56.270 --> 00:27:00.140
at the American Museum
of Natural History.

00:27:00.140 --> 00:27:01.910
This is the center
of the Galaxy,

00:27:01.910 --> 00:27:03.550
this is the sun's location.

00:27:03.550 --> 00:27:05.840
And what you can see is
that most of the stars

00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:08.550
are above the plane
of the Milky Way,

00:27:08.550 --> 00:27:11.380
and that as you get further
away from the plane,

00:27:11.380 --> 00:27:12.970
there's fewer stars.

00:27:12.970 --> 00:27:15.390
We're going to rotate through
the center of the Milky Way

00:27:15.390 --> 00:27:18.280
now, and you'll see
those three stripes

00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:21.810
that I pointed out a few
slides ago come into focus.

00:27:21.810 --> 00:27:26.620
So the first stripe is coming
into focus right around now.

00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:30.940
There's the second,
and then the third.

00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:34.300
And the exact distribution
of these stars,

00:27:34.300 --> 00:27:37.510
how they fall away-- how
the density of these stars

00:27:37.510 --> 00:27:40.070
falls as you get above
or below the plane,

00:27:40.070 --> 00:27:42.760
and how the density
falls as you get further

00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:45.190
away from the Galactic
Center, tells us

00:27:45.190 --> 00:27:48.430
something about the
structure of the Milky Way.

00:27:48.430 --> 00:27:53.360
So if we take one
slice of these stars,

00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:58.280
we can paste it onto a
cartoon of the Milky Way.

00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:02.510
What we're really
measuring is the structure

00:28:02.510 --> 00:28:06.010
of the density of stars
as you get further away

00:28:06.010 --> 00:28:08.660
from the Galactic Center,
and as you get further away

00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:10.520
from the Galactic Plane.

00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:12.290
So the sun would be here.

00:28:12.290 --> 00:28:14.500
And we see that there's
a little bit of a fall

00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:16.230
as you go from here to here.

00:28:16.230 --> 00:28:20.170
And there's a fall as
you get above the plane.

00:28:20.170 --> 00:28:23.830
So this is one of the most
precise maps of the Milky Way

00:28:23.830 --> 00:28:27.190
that's ever been produced
for the nearby Milky Way.

00:28:27.190 --> 00:28:29.710
So within about 1
and 1/2 kiloparsecs,

00:28:29.710 --> 00:28:34.980
we have a great idea as to
exactly how our galaxy appears.

00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:36.630
What I'm working
on now is actually

00:28:36.630 --> 00:28:38.770
a much different scale.

00:28:38.770 --> 00:28:42.800
So we're also using
the same survey data,

00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:47.020
but now trying to pull out the
most intrinsically bright stars

00:28:47.020 --> 00:28:52.460
to go after the shape of
the halo of our Milky Way.

00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:55.730
So we're looking at scales
of 100 kiloparsecs or so.

00:28:55.730 --> 00:28:58.370
Prior to the work
that we've been doing,

00:28:58.370 --> 00:29:03.530
the most distant star was only
about 120 kiloparsecs away.

00:29:03.530 --> 00:29:08.430
We've identified two that are
over 200 kiloparsecs and likely

00:29:08.430 --> 00:29:11.450
some that are probably
closer to 300.

00:29:11.450 --> 00:29:14.410
So we've been using
telescopes all over the world.

00:29:14.410 --> 00:29:18.640
Some of these, the top row, are
mostly telescopes in Hawaii.

00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:21.980
The middle row are telescopes
in the continental US,

00:29:21.980 --> 00:29:24.960
and the lower two are
telescopes in Chile.

00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:27.760
There's a wide team
of collaborators

00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:29.650
that we've called
upon to try and get

00:29:29.650 --> 00:29:33.690
detailed spectral observations
to tell the difference.

00:29:33.690 --> 00:29:35.770
It's actually
relatively difficult

00:29:35.770 --> 00:29:39.453
to use images alone to tell the
difference between a giant star

00:29:39.453 --> 00:29:40.750
and a dwarf star.

00:29:40.750 --> 00:29:43.660
And so we rely on
spectra to nail down

00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:47.110
the difference between
these two stars.

00:29:47.110 --> 00:29:49.830
What's exciting
about this project

00:29:49.830 --> 00:29:56.890
is that these stars are really
at unexplored distances.

00:29:56.890 --> 00:30:01.330
So using a combination
of two different surveys,

00:30:01.330 --> 00:30:05.350
we've been able to identify
about 500 stars that are likely

00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:09.645
anywhere from 200 to potentially
600 kiloparsecs away.

00:30:09.645 --> 00:30:11.840
Now, the three
different histograms

00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:13.950
correspond to
different assumptions

00:30:13.950 --> 00:30:17.630
about the exact chemical
composition of the star,

00:30:17.630 --> 00:30:21.140
and that actually tweaks the
color, absolute magnitude

00:30:21.140 --> 00:30:22.760
relation.

00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:26.690
But the punchline is
that the Milky Way

00:30:26.690 --> 00:30:28.650
would appear much,
much different

00:30:28.650 --> 00:30:30.370
as viewed from the stars.

00:30:30.370 --> 00:30:34.140
So rather than seeing a
wide band across the sky,

00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:36.330
the Milky Way
would appear almost

00:30:36.330 --> 00:30:42.470
like just another small
galaxy in your night sky.

00:30:42.470 --> 00:30:46.790
So we published this
work during the summer,

00:30:46.790 --> 00:30:49.040
and it made a little
bit of a splash.

00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:51.400
So "Gizmodo" and
"Huffington Post"--

00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:54.972
which put me next to Britney
Spears for some reason--

00:30:54.972 --> 00:30:57.880
"Discovery Channel," "The
Philadelphia Inquirer"

00:30:57.880 --> 00:31:01.840
back home, and NBC News
all ran with this story.

00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:04.270
And so it's really been
an exciting result.

00:31:04.270 --> 00:31:07.080
And we're actually--
this is ongoing work.

00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:11.440
So we just got five
nights of observing time

00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:16.800
with an eight meter telescope
in Chile to look at about 10%

00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:17.605
of our samples.

00:31:17.605 --> 00:31:21.210
We're very excited
about this work.

00:31:21.210 --> 00:31:24.300
And in the last
15 minutes or so,

00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:28.050
I want to tell you a little bit
about where this kind of work

00:31:28.050 --> 00:31:28.910
is going.

00:31:28.910 --> 00:31:31.960
So all the results
that I've used so far

00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:34.800
have relied on survey data.

00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:37.390
Surveys are a very
different mode

00:31:37.390 --> 00:31:39.000
of operation for astronomers.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:43.480
We're no longer concerned about
our own individual projects

00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:45.290
and going to the
telescope to look

00:31:45.290 --> 00:31:49.370
at the small number of stars
that we're interested in.

00:31:49.370 --> 00:31:54.550
Instead, schools and large
groups of astronomers

00:31:54.550 --> 00:31:58.260
are working together
to produce surveys

00:31:58.260 --> 00:32:03.340
that produce enough data that
everyone can share and use.

00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:06.200
There's two in particular that I
want to draw your attention to.

00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:09.220
The first is a European
mission known as Gaia.

00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:13.200
Gaia launched last
year and is currently

00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:15.400
starting its observations.

00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:18.270
It is going to produce
a parallax survey

00:32:18.270 --> 00:32:20.270
of a billion stars.

00:32:20.270 --> 00:32:24.720
So this is going to produce the
cleanest fundamental distance

00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:29.104
maps that astronomy and
humanity has ever done.

00:32:29.104 --> 00:32:30.770
All the stars that
it's going to observe

00:32:30.770 --> 00:32:33.200
will get parallax distances.

00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:36.360
And so it's essentially
going to be a high definition

00:32:36.360 --> 00:32:39.980
look at the nearby galaxy.

00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:43.580
It will also measure kinematics,
so velocity information,

00:32:43.580 --> 00:32:46.280
for about 150 million stars.

00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:49.270
And it can measure
a parallactic shift

00:32:49.270 --> 00:32:51.730
of about 10 microarc seconds.

00:32:51.730 --> 00:32:54.600
So that's the angle
that a quarter

00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:56.910
would subtend if you
put it on the moon.

00:32:56.910 --> 00:33:00.770
So it's a ridiculously
precise measurement,

00:33:00.770 --> 00:33:04.350
and like I said, it successfully
launched in December,

00:33:04.350 --> 00:33:06.300
and observations are ongoing.

00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:09.930
And because it's 2015,
Gaia has a Twitter account.

00:33:09.930 --> 00:33:12.410
And so every once
in a while, there

00:33:12.410 --> 00:33:16.580
are these types of
images posted to Twitter.

00:33:16.580 --> 00:33:20.430
So you can follow along
if you're interested.

00:33:20.430 --> 00:33:22.250
But the granddaddy of
them all, and the one

00:33:22.250 --> 00:33:25.240
that I and most
astronomers hopefully

00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:29.590
are very excited about, is
a project known as LSST.

00:33:29.590 --> 00:33:33.080
It stands for the Large
Synoptic Survey Telescope.

00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:35.500
This telescope is
going to be in Chile.

00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:39.440
And its slogan is
"wide fast, deep."

00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:42.890
What it's going to do is
image the entire night sky

00:33:42.890 --> 00:33:45.500
every three days for 10 years.

00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:48.440
So it's essentially going to
reproduce the entire Sloan

00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:52.760
survey every three days
and run for 10 years.

00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:56.370
It's an 8.4 meter telescope.

00:33:56.370 --> 00:33:59.760
It will produce some of the
finest images ever seen.

00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:02.790
This is the filter
assembly being shown here.

00:34:02.790 --> 00:34:07.250
The focal plane is
shown in blue there,

00:34:07.250 --> 00:34:09.760
and you can see that,
as one of these filters

00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:14.550
comes into view,
that will help get

00:34:14.550 --> 00:34:18.710
us detailed observations
about the colors of stars

00:34:18.710 --> 00:34:19.850
and galaxies.

00:34:19.850 --> 00:34:23.150
The camera itself
weighs about three tons.

00:34:23.150 --> 00:34:25.920
It's going to hang off
of the secondary mirror.

00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:27.840
So this is a three
mirror design.

00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:30.770
I'll show you a little bit more
about that in just a second.

00:34:30.770 --> 00:34:32.770
This is not how the
construction is going to go,

00:34:32.770 --> 00:34:35.909
but construction is under way.

00:34:35.909 --> 00:34:39.810
So they've begun to level
off the site down in Chile

00:34:39.810 --> 00:34:41.179
that it's going to be at.

00:34:41.179 --> 00:34:45.270
And some of the hardware is
actually already in place.

00:34:45.270 --> 00:34:48.710
The camera is going to be built
by the Department of Energy,

00:34:48.710 --> 00:34:51.880
and the mirror-- I have a
few pictures of the mirror.

00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:57.310
The primary mirror has
reached a milestone.

00:34:57.310 --> 00:35:01.560
It's essentially completed
its polishing process.

00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:05.320
So the mode of
operation for LSST

00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:10.510
is to tile the night sky
every three days for 10 years.

00:35:10.510 --> 00:35:14.580
So it's going to use six
different filters, and every 30

00:35:14.580 --> 00:35:16.900
seconds, take an
image of the sky

00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:20.030
and move to the next
position, take another image,

00:35:20.030 --> 00:35:24.700
and continue to tile the night
sky each observable night.

00:35:24.700 --> 00:35:27.112
So this is one of the
most ambitious projects

00:35:27.112 --> 00:35:28.620
that's ever been undertaken.

00:35:28.620 --> 00:35:31.330
It's the highest
ranked-- this is

00:35:31.330 --> 00:35:33.760
what happens when
you loop backwards.

00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:36.290
The data is disappearing!

00:35:36.290 --> 00:35:40.350
This is the highest ranked
ground-based astronomy project

00:35:40.350 --> 00:35:42.170
that's underway.

00:35:42.170 --> 00:35:47.220
The imaging camera is going
to be the largest camera ever

00:35:47.220 --> 00:35:51.230
constructed, about
3.2 gigapixels.

00:35:51.230 --> 00:35:53.930
And this is the
actual size to scale.

00:35:53.930 --> 00:35:59.710
And you can see the angular
size would cover an area much,

00:35:59.710 --> 00:36:02.440
much larger than the full moon.

00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:05.230
So here's another detailed look
at the camera with a person

00:36:05.230 --> 00:36:06.570
to scale.

00:36:06.570 --> 00:36:08.280
It weighs about three tons.

00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:11.515
And for each ton, you get about
a gigapixel worth of imaging.

00:36:14.770 --> 00:36:17.370
The images, obviously
we don't have images

00:36:17.370 --> 00:36:21.130
yet from the LSST camera.

00:36:21.130 --> 00:36:25.420
But the survey
design specifications

00:36:25.420 --> 00:36:28.270
are looking for
image quality that

00:36:28.270 --> 00:36:35.130
is slightly better
than Sloan, than SDSS.

00:36:35.130 --> 00:36:36.610
And this is kind
of the difference

00:36:36.610 --> 00:36:39.750
that you would see
between the two surveys.

00:36:39.750 --> 00:36:42.160
It's also going to
push deeper than Sloan.

00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:47.180
So it's going to image the sky
to fainter apparent magnitudes.

00:36:47.180 --> 00:36:50.920
And each field is
going to contain

00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:53.720
millions of stars and galaxies.

00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:57.360
So before, the movie
that I showed you,

00:36:57.360 --> 00:37:00.290
it had a few thousand
cool red dwarfs.

00:37:00.290 --> 00:37:03.190
We're now going to be
looking at millions

00:37:03.190 --> 00:37:06.290
of stars in each image.

00:37:06.290 --> 00:37:11.630
So it's really going to be an
exquisite map of our universe.

00:37:11.630 --> 00:37:14.620
Mirror construction started
at the University of Arizona

00:37:14.620 --> 00:37:16.620
in 2008.

00:37:16.620 --> 00:37:20.110
Just last year-- and you
can see a lot of the VIPs

00:37:20.110 --> 00:37:25.790
there for scale-- last year,
I, along with a professor

00:37:25.790 --> 00:37:27.580
at Haverford College,
Beth Willman,

00:37:27.580 --> 00:37:30.460
took a few undergrads
to the mirror lab.

00:37:30.460 --> 00:37:35.750
And so that's the primary
and tertiary mirrors

00:37:35.750 --> 00:37:38.580
of LSST sitting behind us.

00:37:38.580 --> 00:37:44.720
You may be able to see
a slight change in pitch

00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:46.990
between the outer ring
and the inner ring.

00:37:46.990 --> 00:37:49.280
So the outer ring is
the primary mirror,

00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:52.000
the inner ring is
the third mirror

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:55.930
that the photons will bounce off
of on their way to the camera.

00:37:55.930 --> 00:37:58.260
And actually, just
this past weekend,

00:37:58.260 --> 00:38:00.440
the polishing of this
mirror was completed.

00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:02.640
So there was a little
bit of a celebration.

00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:05.540
People were popping
champagne bottles.

00:38:05.540 --> 00:38:07.820
And it's really a testament
to the work that's

00:38:07.820 --> 00:38:09.810
done at University of Arizona.

00:38:09.810 --> 00:38:11.960
It's an 8.4 meter
mirror, and it's

00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:15.810
polished to within 10
nanometers of focus.

00:38:15.810 --> 00:38:18.650
So it's a painstaking process.

00:38:18.650 --> 00:38:23.540
But it's finished, and
things are looking good.

00:38:23.540 --> 00:38:25.530
First light, the
first observation,

00:38:25.530 --> 00:38:28.200
should be taken
somewhere around 2019,

00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:32.649
with full science observation
starting around 2021.

00:38:32.649 --> 00:38:34.690
When that happens, we're
going to need your guys'

00:38:34.690 --> 00:38:38.520
help, because there's going
to be a lot of data that's

00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:40.600
going to be produced
by this telescope.

00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:43.620
Google's actually already
a partner in LSST,

00:38:43.620 --> 00:38:49.330
and it's the type of challenges
that come out of this much data

00:38:49.330 --> 00:38:51.790
is something that we
really-- astronomers

00:38:51.790 --> 00:38:57.995
need help with optimizing
our analysis of this data.

00:39:02.750 --> 00:39:07.190
There will be gigabytes of
public data available nightly.

00:39:07.190 --> 00:39:10.270
So because we're imaging
the night sky over and over

00:39:10.270 --> 00:39:12.290
and over again, one
of the questions

00:39:12.290 --> 00:39:15.330
that astronomers-- and
potentially the public

00:39:15.330 --> 00:39:18.250
in general-- will be
interested in is things like,

00:39:18.250 --> 00:39:22.660
did a star explode in this
part of the sky last night?

00:39:22.660 --> 00:39:26.480
We're working on
developing alerts that

00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:29.840
can be configurable to any
type of scientific question.

00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:33.730
And obviously, if you're imaging
2 million objects per field,

00:39:33.730 --> 00:39:37.300
and potentially hundreds
of fields per night,

00:39:37.300 --> 00:39:40.110
you don't want every
alert being triggered.

00:39:40.110 --> 00:39:42.740
There is going to be all
sorts of variability that'll

00:39:42.740 --> 00:39:43.280
be observed.

00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:47.880
Stars rotate, and their
brightness changes with time.

00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:51.190
Nearby asteroids would move
across the field of view.

00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:53.890
Distant stars may explode
in other galaxies.

00:39:53.890 --> 00:39:57.640
And so all those questions
are important for astronomy,

00:39:57.640 --> 00:40:00.280
but they're important to
different astronomers.

00:40:00.280 --> 00:40:03.230
And so for someone like myself
that's mapping out the Milky

00:40:03.230 --> 00:40:05.690
Way, I don't want
to be getting alerts

00:40:05.690 --> 00:40:10.170
on my phone saying that there's
an asteroid buzzing around.

00:40:10.170 --> 00:40:16.490
And so that's an ongoing
problem that we're

00:40:16.490 --> 00:40:21.050
trying to work on in
preparation for the survey.

00:40:21.050 --> 00:40:24.210
In addition to that type
of question, what's great

00:40:24.210 --> 00:40:26.600
about these large
surveys is that we also

00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:28.580
get the public involved.

00:40:28.580 --> 00:40:32.670
So one of the more exciting
avenues for public involvement

00:40:32.670 --> 00:40:34.250
that's come out of
Sloan is a project

00:40:34.250 --> 00:40:37.350
known as Galaxy
Zoo, where anyone

00:40:37.350 --> 00:40:41.290
with an internet connection can
go online and look at images

00:40:41.290 --> 00:40:44.090
of galaxies and begin
to classify them.

00:40:44.090 --> 00:40:46.650
And it's actually
led to a number

00:40:46.650 --> 00:40:48.910
of different academic papers.

00:40:48.910 --> 00:40:51.180
But one really cool
discovery, there

00:40:51.180 --> 00:40:54.030
was a schoolteacher
in Denmark that

00:40:54.030 --> 00:40:56.510
discovered an object
that's really, really

00:40:56.510 --> 00:41:00.630
rare-- to the point where, when
it was actually discovered,

00:41:00.630 --> 00:41:04.070
no one really quite knew
what we were looking at.

00:41:04.070 --> 00:41:09.990
It's since been sussed out,
but that type of work really

00:41:09.990 --> 00:41:13.290
only comes out of large
surveys, where you're not

00:41:13.290 --> 00:41:16.920
biasing your view of
the night sky at all.

00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:20.270
In terms of the imaging
that will come out

00:41:20.270 --> 00:41:23.750
of LSST, some of the
data rates, you're

00:41:23.750 --> 00:41:27.070
looking at somewhere around
100 petabytes of imaging data

00:41:27.070 --> 00:41:30.040
by the time the survey
is completely over.

00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:32.930
The catalogs-- so
most astronomers

00:41:32.930 --> 00:41:34.560
don't deal with raw images.

00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:37.700
Instead, we look at
catalogs of objects.

00:41:37.700 --> 00:41:40.820
So whether or not you may
be interested in the star

00:41:40.820 --> 00:41:43.970
catalog, or the galaxy
catalog, all that information

00:41:43.970 --> 00:41:47.860
at the end of the day is
somewhere around 50 petabytes.

00:41:47.860 --> 00:41:52.200
And catalogs will be produced
throughout the duration

00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:53.940
of the survey.

00:41:53.940 --> 00:41:56.190
And for the final
catalog alone, we're

00:41:56.190 --> 00:41:59.360
looking at something
like 15 petabytes or so.

00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:01.300
So the bottom line
is that LSST is

00:42:01.300 --> 00:42:04.210
one of the most exciting surveys
that's ever been planned.

00:42:04.210 --> 00:42:08.290
It's going to result in the
best sky image ever taken.

00:42:08.290 --> 00:42:11.510
With 60 petabytes of
astronomical image data,

00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:15.250
you would need something
like 3 million HDTV sets

00:42:15.250 --> 00:42:17.940
to view all the pixels
that will be coming out

00:42:17.940 --> 00:42:19.520
of this telescope.

00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:21.910
If you stacked all
those images up,

00:42:21.910 --> 00:42:26.130
it would take about 11 months
to view the entire movie.

00:42:26.130 --> 00:42:30.930
So this is really the best movie
that has ever been constructed.

00:42:30.930 --> 00:42:32.840
And for the first
time, we're going

00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:35.390
to produce an
astronomical catalog.

00:42:35.390 --> 00:42:39.060
Somewhere around 40
billion stars and galaxies

00:42:39.060 --> 00:42:41.000
will be in this catalog.

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:44.980
And that, for the first time,
will dwarf the number of people

00:42:44.980 --> 00:42:46.470
here on earth.

00:42:46.470 --> 00:42:50.130
So it's an exciting time
for surveys and astronomy,

00:42:50.130 --> 00:42:52.120
and I thank you for
your time and attention.

00:42:52.120 --> 00:42:53.830
And I'll take any questions.

00:42:53.830 --> 00:42:56.230
[APPLAUSE]

00:42:59.110 --> 00:43:02.110
AUDIENCE: So you mentioned
that the Sloan telescope sends

00:43:02.110 --> 00:43:04.640
the data to the
University of Washington

00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:06.382
to be printed out
on those sheets.

00:43:06.382 --> 00:43:07.590
What was the purpose of that?

00:43:07.590 --> 00:43:08.620
I don't understand.

00:43:08.620 --> 00:43:09.495
JOHN BOCHANKSI: Yeah.

00:43:09.495 --> 00:43:11.940
So you take an image
of the night sky,

00:43:11.940 --> 00:43:14.740
and you would
really-- ideally, you

00:43:14.740 --> 00:43:17.250
would want a spectrum
of everything, right?

00:43:17.250 --> 00:43:19.990
But you can't do that, because
you don't have the telescope

00:43:19.990 --> 00:43:23.280
time in order to make
all those observations.

00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:25.830
And so there were pipelines.

00:43:25.830 --> 00:43:28.050
There was essentially
code that was written

00:43:28.050 --> 00:43:32.200
that said, all right, if I'm
interested in distant galaxies,

00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:33.790
look at this imaging
data, tell me

00:43:33.790 --> 00:43:36.740
where we think all those
distant galaxies are,

00:43:36.740 --> 00:43:38.590
and record their location.

00:43:38.590 --> 00:43:41.080
And then there's another group
that's interested in stars,

00:43:41.080 --> 00:43:43.800
and they run a
different code, and that

00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:45.480
produces the most
interesting stars

00:43:45.480 --> 00:43:47.970
that they want to get those
detailed observations on.

00:43:47.970 --> 00:43:50.600
And so it was kind of a
democratic process that

00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:54.820
was set up, with the goal being
that, at the end of the survey,

00:43:54.820 --> 00:43:57.220
the big scientific questions
that we were interested in

00:43:57.220 --> 00:43:58.400
were answered.

00:43:58.400 --> 00:44:02.960
And so for each
position on the sky,

00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:09.320
640 objects were selected to
get those detailed observations.

00:44:09.320 --> 00:44:11.150
And so that's when
the positions were

00:44:11.150 --> 00:44:13.645
sent to the University
of Washington.

00:44:13.645 --> 00:44:15.520
The holes were drilled,
and then those plates

00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:17.934
were shipped back
down to New Mexico.

00:44:17.934 --> 00:44:18.600
AUDIENCE: I see.

00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:20.630
So what was the advantage
of actually drilling

00:44:20.630 --> 00:44:22.570
them versus just
creating computer images

00:44:22.570 --> 00:44:24.832
and viewing them on a monitor?

00:44:24.832 --> 00:44:27.040
JOHN BOCHANKSI: Because it's
a different observation,

00:44:27.040 --> 00:44:27.580
all right?

00:44:27.580 --> 00:44:31.020
So one, you're taking
an image, and you

00:44:31.020 --> 00:44:35.710
get essentially position on the
sky, some color information,

00:44:35.710 --> 00:44:39.360
and the shape of either
your star or your galaxy.

00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:42.140
But if you take a
spectrum of an object,

00:44:42.140 --> 00:44:45.110
that tells you things that you
can't get out of the image.

00:44:45.110 --> 00:44:49.760
So that tells you more about
the composition of the object,

00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:53.770
like what elements are in the
atmospheres of these stars.

00:44:53.770 --> 00:44:57.050
It also tells you something
about the velocity,

00:44:57.050 --> 00:44:59.630
because you use the
Doppler shift to measure

00:44:59.630 --> 00:45:03.040
the relative velocity
between you and the object

00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:04.320
that you're interested in.

00:45:04.320 --> 00:45:08.650
So essentially, it gives
you more information

00:45:08.650 --> 00:45:11.560
than just an image alone.

00:45:11.560 --> 00:45:14.580
AUDIENCE: The star that's
1 million light-years away,

00:45:14.580 --> 00:45:16.496
how do you know it
belongs to our Milky Way?

00:45:16.496 --> 00:45:18.120
JOHN BOCHANKSI: That's
a good question.

00:45:18.120 --> 00:45:22.920
So we know the
velocity of the star.

00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:24.270
And we know its distance.

00:45:24.270 --> 00:45:28.410
And what we do is compute
a potential orbit.

00:45:28.410 --> 00:45:32.425
We assume a model for the
gravitational potential

00:45:32.425 --> 00:45:37.690
of the Milky Way, and
we then-- we essentially

00:45:37.690 --> 00:45:42.810
turn the clock backwards and
say, if we look at the orbit

00:45:42.810 --> 00:45:48.160
and see where it started,
did it have enough velocity,

00:45:48.160 --> 00:45:52.930
or enough energy associated
with it, to leave the Milky Way?

00:45:52.930 --> 00:45:55.160
So if it was above
or below, it's

00:45:55.160 --> 00:45:57.140
known as the escape velocity.

00:45:57.140 --> 00:46:00.560
So for the Earth, you have
to hit about 11 kilometers

00:46:00.560 --> 00:46:02.836
per second or so to
escape the Earth.

00:46:02.836 --> 00:46:04.210
For the Milky Way,
it's somewhere

00:46:04.210 --> 00:46:07.730
between 500 and 600
kilometers per second.

00:46:07.730 --> 00:46:09.940
And the velocities
of these stars

00:46:09.940 --> 00:46:11.987
are much smaller than that.

00:46:11.987 --> 00:46:13.820
AUDIENCE: One that's
been in the press a lot

00:46:13.820 --> 00:46:16.650
that you haven't mentioned was
the James Webb Space Telescope.

00:46:16.650 --> 00:46:18.275
Could you talk a
little bit about that?

00:46:18.275 --> 00:46:20.660
And how does relate to what
you've been talking about?

00:46:20.660 --> 00:46:21.535
JOHN BOCHANKSI: Sure.

00:46:21.535 --> 00:46:24.400
So the James Webb
Space Telescope,

00:46:24.400 --> 00:46:26.740
which is the
successor to Hubble,

00:46:26.740 --> 00:46:28.260
it's essentially
a different mode

00:46:28.260 --> 00:46:32.510
of operation from the surveys
that I've been discussing.

00:46:32.510 --> 00:46:35.090
So if you wanted to do
something like Sloan

00:46:35.090 --> 00:46:37.340
with the Hubble
Space Telescope, it

00:46:37.340 --> 00:46:41.940
would take you over a century
to just image the sky.

00:46:41.940 --> 00:46:44.420
What's great about
these space telescopes,

00:46:44.420 --> 00:46:48.420
though, is that if you find
a very interesting object,

00:46:48.420 --> 00:46:52.590
then you can get very detailed
and precise measurements

00:46:52.590 --> 00:46:53.880
on the object.

00:46:53.880 --> 00:46:55.340
And what's great
about James Webb--

00:46:55.340 --> 00:46:58.330
so Hubble works in the visual
part of the spectrum, which

00:46:58.330 --> 00:46:59.876
is what our eyes see.

00:46:59.876 --> 00:47:01.250
James Webb is
going to be focused

00:47:01.250 --> 00:47:03.700
on the infrared part
of the spectrum.

00:47:03.700 --> 00:47:06.970
And why that's
important, primarily,

00:47:06.970 --> 00:47:09.540
the thing that I'm kind
of most excited about,

00:47:09.540 --> 00:47:12.000
is that that lets you
get a better handle

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:15.930
on the properties of
planets around other stars.

00:47:15.930 --> 00:47:19.600
And so we actually talked about
this a little bit at lunch,

00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:22.150
but James Webb will
essentially give us

00:47:22.150 --> 00:47:28.560
the first definitive measurement
of atmospheres around planets,

00:47:28.560 --> 00:47:29.700
around other stars.

00:47:29.700 --> 00:47:32.410
We're starting to
do this right now,

00:47:32.410 --> 00:47:36.370
but the signal-to-noise of those
measurements is fairly small.

00:47:36.370 --> 00:47:40.040
With James Webb, it won't
be small at all anymore.

00:47:40.040 --> 00:47:43.590
So that's probably one of
the most exciting things

00:47:43.590 --> 00:47:45.820
that will come
out of James Webb.

00:47:45.820 --> 00:47:49.260
AUDIENCE: You mentioned imaging
the same part of the sky again

00:47:49.260 --> 00:47:51.880
and again every few nights.

00:47:51.880 --> 00:47:54.670
So I could see one thing
you're looking for is changes.

00:47:54.670 --> 00:47:57.150
But is another thing that
you're looking for building up

00:47:57.150 --> 00:47:58.670
better statistics
of the same area?

00:47:58.670 --> 00:47:58.940
JOHN BOCHANKSI: Yes.

00:47:58.940 --> 00:48:00.231
Yeah, and actually thanks for--

00:48:00.231 --> 00:48:02.200
AUDIENCE: I was wondering
how many times you

00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:05.135
do that before you're really
not getting much more, you know?

00:48:05.135 --> 00:48:07.510
JOHN BOCHANKSI: And thanks
for mentioning that, because I

00:48:07.510 --> 00:48:11.040
failed to bring
that up in the talk.

00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:13.000
Each part of the
sky is essentially

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:15.190
going to get about
1,000 pictures taken

00:48:15.190 --> 00:48:17.350
of it over the
course of the survey.

00:48:17.350 --> 00:48:19.350
And so one of the
things that you can do

00:48:19.350 --> 00:48:22.880
is essentially add all
those images together,

00:48:22.880 --> 00:48:26.460
and you're going to be able to
push a few magnitudes deeper

00:48:26.460 --> 00:48:28.010
than a single image.

00:48:28.010 --> 00:48:31.280
And so that, at the
end of the survey,

00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:36.600
you're going to have a slightly
deeper view of the Milky Way,

00:48:36.600 --> 00:48:39.030
primarily of its
halo, than you would

00:48:39.030 --> 00:48:41.630
from just a single image alone.

00:48:41.630 --> 00:48:45.350
And so 1,000 is about the
number that we're shooting for.

00:48:45.350 --> 00:48:47.780
And one of the nice
modes of-- or one

00:48:47.780 --> 00:48:50.730
of the nice things that comes
out of surveys like Sloan

00:48:50.730 --> 00:48:53.990
or LSST, and the
reason that "wide"

00:48:53.990 --> 00:48:55.640
is the first thing
that's mentioned

00:48:55.640 --> 00:49:01.580
in the slogan for the
survey, is that by going wide

00:49:01.580 --> 00:49:06.270
you recover more stars and
galaxies than if you just

00:49:06.270 --> 00:49:07.520
push deeper and deeper.

00:49:07.520 --> 00:49:10.430
So that's the first
thing that you try and do

00:49:10.430 --> 00:49:14.490
with a survey is cover as
much of the sky as possible.

00:49:14.490 --> 00:49:19.410
AUDIENCE: It would seem, taking
the full picture multiple times

00:49:19.410 --> 00:49:22.150
like that, you would have
a really great opportunity

00:49:22.150 --> 00:49:28.290
to catch things like nearby
novae or faraway supernovae

00:49:28.290 --> 00:49:29.990
as they're just starting up.

00:49:29.990 --> 00:49:32.890
But that also-- the
amount of processing

00:49:32.890 --> 00:49:35.935
to do that very quickly
in real time, or at least

00:49:35.935 --> 00:49:38.560
over the course of a day or two
so you can catch them when it's

00:49:38.560 --> 00:49:41.450
still useful, is
that something that

00:49:41.450 --> 00:49:43.330
seems feasible with
what we have now?

00:49:43.330 --> 00:49:44.760
Or do we need to develop some--

00:49:44.760 --> 00:49:46.343
JOHN BOCHANKSI: That
will be hopefully

00:49:46.343 --> 00:49:49.820
one of the main science products
that comes out of the survey.

00:49:49.820 --> 00:49:53.290
So the actual cadence
of observations

00:49:53.290 --> 00:49:55.560
is something that's
still being worked on.

00:49:55.560 --> 00:49:59.750
But essentially, there's
going to be two short visits

00:49:59.750 --> 00:50:04.030
to catch things that vary on the
scale of about anywhere from 20

00:50:04.030 --> 00:50:09.350
to 40 seconds, and then a
return a few days later.

00:50:09.350 --> 00:50:14.830
Supernovae tend to brighten on
the scale of about a few days.

00:50:14.830 --> 00:50:19.260
But they're one of the primary
science drivers for the survey.

00:50:19.260 --> 00:50:22.220
They should-- within the
first year of observations,

00:50:22.220 --> 00:50:26.420
we'll get somewhere
around 200,000 supernovae.

00:50:26.420 --> 00:50:30.110
And the reason that
supernovae are important,

00:50:30.110 --> 00:50:32.735
the Nobel Prize was just
awarded for observations

00:50:32.735 --> 00:50:35.840
of about 40 or so
supernovae that

00:50:35.840 --> 00:50:38.410
led to discovering
the characterization

00:50:38.410 --> 00:50:39.561
of dark energy.

00:50:39.561 --> 00:50:41.060
In the first year
alone, we're going

00:50:41.060 --> 00:50:42.980
to be able to do
very similar work,

00:50:42.980 --> 00:50:46.140
but with 200,000 supernovae.

00:50:46.140 --> 00:50:48.780
And so that will
really help us pin down

00:50:48.780 --> 00:50:52.910
the exact composition of
regular matter, dark matter,

00:50:52.910 --> 00:50:55.840
and dark energy, and
hopefully illuminate

00:50:55.840 --> 00:51:00.050
some of the questions
that we still have.

00:51:00.050 --> 00:51:01.200
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:03.170
Have you ever worked--
have you ever heard

00:51:03.170 --> 00:51:06.800
about SIM, Space
Interferometer Mission?

00:51:06.800 --> 00:51:10.070
JOHN BOCHANKSI: Yes,
I did hear about SIM.

00:51:10.070 --> 00:51:13.870
AUDIENCE: So I worked at
JPL for many years on SIM.

00:51:13.870 --> 00:51:17.940
And so the purpose was to
measure the motion of stars

00:51:17.940 --> 00:51:20.390
to the microarcsecond level.

00:51:20.390 --> 00:51:26.860
So interferometers, there's been
also adaptive optics programs.

00:51:26.860 --> 00:51:28.990
So you know, these
surveys are really

00:51:28.990 --> 00:51:30.470
getting really
impressive in terms

00:51:30.470 --> 00:51:34.480
of the resolution, the
megapixels, gigapixels.

00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:37.240
So the question is,
so the aim of SIM

00:51:37.240 --> 00:51:40.360
was mostly to actually
detect exoplanets,

00:51:40.360 --> 00:51:43.620
to see planets around stars.

00:51:43.620 --> 00:51:49.770
So from the data you
measure, to that level,

00:51:49.770 --> 00:51:51.580
can you actually
measure-- can you

00:51:51.580 --> 00:51:54.770
tell if there is an
exoplanet around a star,

00:51:54.770 --> 00:51:59.550
you know, by lateral motions,
or perhaps with microeclipses,

00:51:59.550 --> 00:52:03.610
you know by seeing
the magnitude change?

00:52:03.610 --> 00:52:06.205
The microeclipse
technique, or side motions.

00:52:06.205 --> 00:52:07.080
JOHN BOCHANKSI: Yeah.

00:52:07.080 --> 00:52:09.930
So you hit the nail on the head.

00:52:09.930 --> 00:52:13.749
So Gaia is going to be a
little better than LSST.

00:52:13.749 --> 00:52:15.290
AUDIENCE: Gaia was
actually basically

00:52:15.290 --> 00:52:18.780
the European version of SIM.

00:52:18.780 --> 00:52:20.680
So SIM was canceled,
unfortunately,

00:52:20.680 --> 00:52:22.485
and they decided
to go with Gaia.

00:52:22.485 --> 00:52:23.360
JOHN BOCHANKSI: Yeah.

00:52:23.360 --> 00:52:27.860
So Gaia will do the best
job of detecting planets,

00:52:27.860 --> 00:52:30.860
and the European
astronomers have

00:52:30.860 --> 00:52:35.320
worked on making estimates
of exactly how many planets

00:52:35.320 --> 00:52:39.110
may come out of measuring
the wobble of stars

00:52:39.110 --> 00:52:41.940
as they get tugged by
their planetary companions.

00:52:41.940 --> 00:52:46.510
And so there's-- I've seen
estimates of hundreds to I

00:52:46.510 --> 00:52:48.640
think 1,000 or so.

00:52:48.640 --> 00:52:52.720
But I looked at that paper
a long, long time ago.

00:52:52.720 --> 00:53:00.800
And LSST will also be somewhat
good at detecting some planets.

00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:02.970
It's not its primary mission.

00:53:02.970 --> 00:53:06.360
But certainly, there's going
to be planetary companions that

00:53:06.360 --> 00:53:10.930
pass between us and
their host stars.

00:53:10.930 --> 00:53:13.680
So the best
telescope that's ever

00:53:13.680 --> 00:53:16.550
been made at finding
planets is Kepler.

00:53:16.550 --> 00:53:20.560
It has confirmed about
1,000 exoplanets to date,

00:53:20.560 --> 00:53:23.560
and it has something
like almost 5,000 more.

00:53:23.560 --> 00:53:26.065
That uses a transit method.

00:53:26.065 --> 00:53:27.940
AUDIENCE: Kepler is the
real tool to do that.

00:53:27.940 --> 00:53:29.030
JOHN BOCHANKSI: Kepler
is the real tool.

00:53:29.030 --> 00:53:32.060
And Kepler is still going, but
in a slightly different mode.

00:53:32.060 --> 00:53:34.620
LSST will pick some
of these up, but it'll

00:53:34.620 --> 00:53:37.062
be mostly serendipitous.

00:53:37.062 --> 00:53:39.270
AUDIENCE: What's the model
for working with this data

00:53:39.270 --> 00:53:40.340
once you've got it?

00:53:40.340 --> 00:53:44.552
I mean, can Joe Shmo sitting
at home submit a query and say,

00:53:44.552 --> 00:53:46.010
send me an alert
every time there's

00:53:46.010 --> 00:53:48.710
a star whose
magnitude is 3.1415?

00:53:48.710 --> 00:53:53.400
JOHN BOCHANKSI: Yeah--
well, so all right.

00:53:53.400 --> 00:53:56.100
So there's not too many stars
that have that magnitude.

00:53:56.100 --> 00:53:58.930
But yes, yes, you can.

00:53:58.930 --> 00:54:01.680
The data will be public.

00:54:01.680 --> 00:54:03.650
So if you have an
internet connection,

00:54:03.650 --> 00:54:05.100
you can get this data.

00:54:05.100 --> 00:54:10.240
And that's really one
of the primary-- that's

00:54:10.240 --> 00:54:15.390
been in the description of
the survey from day one.

00:54:15.390 --> 00:54:19.850
And how that interaction
actually happens, typically

00:54:19.850 --> 00:54:25.100
what we use now are large SQL
queries and that kind of thing.

00:54:25.100 --> 00:54:27.170
So some of that
will be available.

00:54:27.170 --> 00:54:30.050
There will be nicer
UIs that are developed.

00:54:30.050 --> 00:54:34.350
I think there's
already an iOS app.

00:54:34.350 --> 00:54:36.800
So it's kind of a
work in progress,

00:54:36.800 --> 00:54:39.450
exactly how you
interact with the data.

00:54:39.450 --> 00:54:42.020
But anyone with an
internet connection

00:54:42.020 --> 00:54:42.979
will have access to it.

00:54:42.979 --> 00:54:44.228
MALE SPEAKER: Thank you, John.

00:54:44.228 --> 00:54:45.560
JOHN BOCHANKSI: Thanks.
