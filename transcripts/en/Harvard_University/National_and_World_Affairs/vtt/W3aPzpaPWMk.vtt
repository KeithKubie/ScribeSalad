00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:15.369
Good evening everybody and welcome

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:17.100
my name is Trey Grayson

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.820
I'm the director of the institute of
politics and i want to welcome everybody

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.240
the john f_ kennedy junior forum here at
the harvard kennedy school

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.970
uh... before introduce uh... the speaker
Mr. Gingrich I want to go over some ground

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.449
rules for tonight's event

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.190
uh... freedom of speech and civility

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.620
are bedrock principles at the john f_
kennedy junior forum at harvard

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.060
university and our democracy

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:42.510
and in fact it is in his inaugural address

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.560
president kennedy reminded us

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.380
that's civility is not a sign of weakness

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.660
and sincerity is always subject to proof

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.570
the forum is one of the few places in
america

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.160
where you can hear from national and
world leaders

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.400
hear them speak

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.350
and then have their speeches followed by
an unfettered question-and-answer session

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.070
with members of the audience a practice
that invariably results

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.280
in lively exchanges

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.240
the reason why this is successful is our
audience respects our speakers rights to

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:14.720
free speech

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.090
as well as the right

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.830
of our audience members to listen to our
speakers

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:25.380
in turn our speakers respect our
audience's right to ask unfiltered

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.780
sometimes tough

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:27.740
sorry about that

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.130
but always fair

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.229
questions

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:32.090
now by following tonight's rules

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.579
this is going to be yet another
successful event here at the john f_

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:36.300

good evening and welcome

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:18.769
thank you for coming to our screening of a City upon a Hill

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:23.239
newt and I would like to thank the institute of
politics for the opportunity to be with

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:25.329
you here this evening

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:28.999
we'd also like to thank our producer
david bossi

00:03:28.999 --> 00:03:31.409
our director kevin Knoblock

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:37.349
and the entire team at citizens united
productions with whom we made this film

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:42.239
a City upon a hill explores the
concept american exceptionalism

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:45.179
from its origin to present day

00:03:45.179 --> 00:03:50.929
puritan john winthrop first captured the
idea of an exceptional nation in 1630

00:03:50.929 --> 00:03:55.459
when he encouraged settlers
headed to the new world to create a

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:57.899
community or as he called it

00:03:57.899 --> 00:03:59.749
a city upon a hill

00:03:59.749 --> 00:04:03.899
to serve as a model for the rest of
the world

00:04:03.899 --> 00:04:09.149
our founding fathers had this game idea
in mind when they created america's

00:04:09.149 --> 00:04:10.949
founding documents

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:14.929
defined by the ideals of life, liberty

00:04:14.929 --> 00:04:17.739
and the pursuit of happiness

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:19.810
at no other time in history

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:24.740
had a nation declared that its citizens 
were endowed by their creator

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.319
with certain inalienable rights.

00:04:27.319 --> 00:04:32.259
rights that no king or government could
take away

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:33.690
this truth

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.879
that our rights come from god

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:38.960
has provided americans with boundless freedom

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.030
and opportunity

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:42.520
yet today

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:47.639
many misunderstand why america is an
exceptional nation

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:52.159
often claiming that we're no different
from other countries

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:56.650
but american exceptionalism is not a
matter of arrogance

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:00.300
it's a recognition that we are unique
nation

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.349
based on individual liberty

00:05:02.349 --> 00:05:03.659
dignity

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:06.830
and personal responsibility

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:11.439
if we forget this we will be in danger
of surrendering our rights as

00:05:11.439 --> 00:05:12.869
individuals

00:05:12.869 --> 00:05:18.250
the antithesis of what our founding
fathers envisioned for america

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:24.020
as citizens we must have the courage to
ensure that america remains an

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:31.020
exceptional nation. a challenge that is the
that essence of the american creed

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:36.029
we hope you'll enjoy a city upon a
hill and share message

00:05:36.029 --> 00:05:43.029
thank you and god bless

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:48.439
Let me join Callista in thanking all of you
first of all for being here and for

00:05:48.439 --> 00:05:52.179
allowing us to share this with you. I hope
as you watch the film you'll think about

00:05:52.179 --> 00:05:59.179
questions

00:06:00.909 --> 00:06:07.080
those students are disrupting the forum harvard security
please remove those individuals

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:12.229
so as i was saying I hope that you
will.. Harvard police please make your way

00:06:12.229 --> 00:06:19.229
up to there on the third floor sorry mr. speaker
for the interruption 

00:06:26.889 --> 00:06:31.479
actually I'll be allowed to take questions 
later on about those kind of ideas i think

00:06:31.479 --> 00:06:33.400
we are 100%

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:40.400
I think we're all americans and I think it's importnant

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:46.250
I started to say I hope as you watch the film
Callista

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:50.830
has written a children's introductory
book for forty to eight olds called Sweet land of Liberty

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:53.070
which actually became a new York Times bestseller

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:59.669
and i wrote book aimed at you and other folks
other citizens called A Nation like No Other

00:06:59.669 --> 00:07:03.989
there's a pew result out today that
exactly illustrates why we're having

00:07:03.989 --> 00:07:05.739
this conversation

00:07:05.739 --> 00:07:08.880
because in order tests how many
americans liked american

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:10.110
exceptionalism

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:13.830
teh pew foundation asked the question
how many of you think our culture is

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:15.620
superior

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:17.589
which is not at all what it means

00:07:17.589 --> 00:07:23.190
american exceptionalism relates directly to
one document the declaration of 

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:24.759
independence to its assertion

00:07:24.759 --> 00:07:28.599
that we hold these truths to be self-evident
that we're all created equal

00:07:28.599 --> 00:07:33.379
that we are endowed by our creator
with certain unalienable rights

00:07:33.379 --> 00:07:35.300
from that assertion

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:36.510
comes citizenship rather

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:38.370
than being a subject

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:40.539
it's a reason that abraham lincoln

00:07:40.539 --> 00:07:44.150
in eighteen sixty one on his way to
being inaugurated

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:46.529
stopped at independence hall

00:07:46.529 --> 00:07:48.419
and sat in philadelphia

00:07:48.419 --> 00:07:50.569
at the eve of the civil war

00:07:50.569 --> 00:07:55.279
nothing that mattered in his political
philosophy in his entire life

00:07:55.279 --> 00:07:59.159
came from anywhere except the
declaration of independence

00:07:59.159 --> 00:08:03.919
and i believe that next year this will be one
of the central questions in the

00:08:03.919 --> 00:08:05.729
presidential campaign

00:08:05.729 --> 00:08:10.199
whether we are in fact an exceptional
nation endowed by our creator

00:08:10.199 --> 00:08:15.069
or whether like the european countries
we're simply subjects to a government

00:08:15.069 --> 00:08:20.119
randomly gathered protoplasm with no
inherent liberties simply existing at

00:08:20.119 --> 00:08:21.759
the suffrance of the elites

00:08:21.759 --> 00:08:25.149
and i think the difference in those two
is extraordinary i hope you enjoy the

00:08:25.149 --> 00:08:29.389
film i look forward to your questions afterwards
i've never been here before that it didn't

00:08:29.389 --> 00:08:32.919
turn out to be fun and interesting and different
i'm confident you will make it the same

00:08:32.919 --> 00:08:39.919
tonight thank you very much

00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:23.330
alright well i think we're ready to have a little 
discussion now

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:25.350
we at the uh, at the IOP over the years, we

00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:29.750
regularly extend invitations to the major presidential 
candidates

00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:33.600
and a lot fo them come to speak here at the forum, 
we are really glad to have you here. When I emailed you

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:35.860
uh... you said hey I've got an idea

00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:37.880
let's do a screening of a documentary

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:39.650
let's talk about

00:09:39.650 --> 00:09:41.020
Americna exceptionalism

00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:43.770
and then we'll talk and do some q and a

00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:48.640
that's not the normal way the candidates respond to 
our invitation. We said sure let's do it

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:52.060
and you actually told me, go on the
website pick out one, I hope you all like this one

00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:54.480
I picked this out

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:55.740
why

00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:58.740
why did you want to do it this way? Why'd you want to show
the documentary and then talk about it?

00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:01.290
i think that the

00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:05.120
largest choice facing the united states

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:07.610
is actually a cultural choice

00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:09.110
and

00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:12.700
i began getting involved in this back in

00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:14.410
two thousand two

00:10:14.410 --> 00:10:16.970
when the ninth circuit court ruled that

00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:18.890
one nation under god

00:10:18.890 --> 00:10:22.010
in the statue and and and uh... in the
uh... pledge of allegiance

00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:25.010
was unconstitutional

00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:27.150
interestingly tomorrow

00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:29.110
is the anniversary

00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:31.980
of lincoln's gettysburg address

00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:34.420
and in eighteen sixty three

00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:39.660
lincoln sits on the dias,looking out on
the first national military cemetery

00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:42.910
the graves of thousands of young men

00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:44.970
and he ads to

00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:46.160
his address

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:48.340
under God

00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:51.560
those you think i was just a random
notation

00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:53.270
go to the

00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:55.390
lincoln memorial

00:10:55.390 --> 00:10:57.580
where on one side you will see

00:10:57.580 --> 00:11:00.040
one nation under god

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:01.850
on the other side you'll see

00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:04.460
his second inaugural

00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:06.950
march of eighteen sixty five

00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:09.010
four years of war

00:11:09.010 --> 00:11:13.510
six hundred and twenty thousand dead
americans

00:11:13.510 --> 00:11:14.850
lincoln

00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:17.250
took the war as a personal responsiblity

00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:19.450
he knew that

00:11:19.450 --> 00:11:21.140
at any point

00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:24.730
when he would accept the south leaving
more war would end

00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:26.770
so in a sense he willed

00:11:26.770 --> 00:11:28.580
the preservation of the union

00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:31.100
at the cost of six hundred and twenty thousand dead

00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:33.530
it fundamentally reshaped him as a person

00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:38.600
you see this if you read his magnificent
rational lawyer-like speech at

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:42.910
cooper union seventy two hundred words
in february of eighteen sixty and then

00:11:42.910 --> 00:11:44.160
read

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:45.920
eighteen sixty five

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:48.830
in seven hundred into words

00:11:48.830 --> 00:11:52.320
abraham lincoln refers to God fourteen
times

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:56.010
and quotes the Bible twice

00:11:56.010 --> 00:11:59.320
now i responded to the ninth circuit

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:03.060
much like lincoln responded to the dred
scott decision in the eighteen fifties which

00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:07.190
said that slavery was automatically
extended across the whole country

00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:11.260
because I honestly believe that we are
either an exceptional nation endowed by

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:12.530
our creator

00:12:12.530 --> 00:12:14.949
with certain inalienable rights in which
case

00:12:14.949 --> 00:12:18.550
each one of you is personally sovereign

00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:21.150
and youloan power to the state

00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:23.480
the state does not loan power to you

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:25.470
i believe this was the heart of america

00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:28.210
i think the founding fathers wrote it
very deliberately

00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:31.930
it represented the essence of their
understanding of life

00:12:31.930 --> 00:12:36.000
that's why they start out by saying we
hold these truths to be self-evident

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.950
and i believe it was a great cultural
struggle which this campus is one fo the centerpieces

00:12:40.950 --> 00:12:44.400
between people who believe that that's
all nonesense that we're essentially randomly

00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:47.660
gathered protoplasm who happened to of
lucked out

00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:51.080
and to have ended up geographically in places with
reasonably good government that has not

00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:53.059
yet been totally destroyed by power

00:12:53.059 --> 00:12:54.520
hungry politicians

00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:58.560
but that there's no inherent underlying
structure of exceptionalism

00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:02.450
and this notion of exceptionalism is at the very core
of being American

00:13:02.450 --> 00:13:05.410
it's why the wright brothers, the
wright brothers the smithsonian are engaged

00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:06.650
in a competition

00:13:06.650 --> 00:13:09.990
The Smithsonian got just under fifty thousand dollars from
congress and failed

00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:12.980
The Wright brothers got nothing and invented
the airplane

00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:16.200
and its not the congress, Im not saying the policy

00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:18.239
that it's good government or bad government I'm 
just saying

00:13:18.239 --> 00:13:21.260
the spirit of 
entrepreneurial

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:24.510
pioneering the spirit of creating things

00:13:24.510 --> 00:13:27.880
this spirit that anyone of us in this
room

00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:29.760
can be virtually anything

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:32.710
is a peculiarly american experience

00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:36.650
Arnold Schwarzenegger gets to be governor of our
largest state

00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:38.960
worth hundreds of millions of dollars

00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:41.560
if he ha dstayed in austria

00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:42.780
he would have been hopeless

00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:45.920
nobody of his background could've become
president of Austria

00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:47.900
would've been an absurdity

00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:49.830
yet here he can

00:13:49.830 --> 00:13:54.170
and so we engage in a cultural struggle plus
i've now done seven movies all of them

00:13:54.170 --> 00:13:56.519
documentaries as part of the cultural
struggle

00:13:56.519 --> 00:14:00.650
i've written a series of books, she's just written
Sweet Land of Liberty for 4-8 year olds

00:14:00.650 --> 00:14:04.520
but this is the cultural component of the
political campaign

00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:06.900
I'll give you one example

00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:08.930
i have a proposal

00:14:08.930 --> 00:14:11.830
that if you get unemployment
compensation

00:14:11.830 --> 00:14:15.480
you should be required to sign up for
a training program

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:19.270
we should not give people money for
ninety nine weeks for doing nothing

00:14:19.270 --> 00:14:21.250
that it fundamentally undermines them

00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:22.200
limits them

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:23.840
weakens them

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:25.729
and if you can't find a job

00:14:25.729 --> 00:14:28.530
we ought to take the time we are paying
you

00:14:28.530 --> 00:14:32.740
and make sure you learn so you can
actually get a job

00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:37.310
because that way you dramatically expand
human capital but you also reestablish the

00:14:37.310 --> 00:14:38.180
work ethic

00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:40.360
obviously all of you are students and

00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:45.040
you're all elite students at an elite university
so this will not shock you

00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:48.960
but one of my messages is a, this is a sign of
how daring I am as a candidate

00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:52.180
as I go around the country I say look, one of the
keys is really simple

00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:55.250
students are going to actually have to study

00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:58.490
you know we actually have to have grades given
based on achievement

00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:02.620
we can't afford a socially promote
because it cheats the kids

00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:05.210
now that's the skill of difference

00:15:05.210 --> 00:15:09.089
uh... that i think we represent and in
this film in essence, I've always thought

00:15:09.089 --> 00:15:11.620
there would be three great themes next year

00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:12.840
if i end up uh...

00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:14.110
in seven

00:15:14.110 --> 00:15:16.450
three-hour debates with the president Obama

00:15:16.450 --> 00:15:20.600
one would be the economy, I mean how could have this level of 
disaster and not have that focus

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:21.980
that focus

00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:25.410
the second would be the question of
american exceptionalism vs

00:15:25.410 --> 00:15:27.770
the sort of bureaucratic socialist model

00:15:27.770 --> 00:15:30.420
and the third would be national
security

00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:34.120
and that those three will be the
organizing principles in the entire campaign

00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:35.870
and that's why this film i thought

00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:40.290
was a very useful starting point. All right well let's
go to those other two topics for the debates

00:15:40.290 --> 00:15:42.120
uh... let's start with the economy what would you

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:45.180
do if you were president to get this economy
moving again

00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:47.780
One of the reasons I became a historian

00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:51.190
is that imitation is cheaper than invention

00:15:51.190 --> 00:15:53.110
so you want to solve something

00:15:53.110 --> 00:15:55.840
go look for somebody that solved it

00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:58.940
i've been through two sets of solutions
on the economy nineteen seventy nine

00:15:58.940 --> 00:15:59.960
nineteen eighty

00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:02.820
art laffer who's up there who invented
the laffer curve

00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:07.080
uh... jude wanniski jack kemp uh...
bunch of us helped create supply-side

00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:10.920
economics ronald reagan campaigned on it
i campaigned with him i was a freshman

00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:12.220
congressman

00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:15.910
reagan had four pillars to his
economic policy

00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:20.420
cut taxes cut regulations developme
American energy

00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:22.029
and reward, honor, and

00:16:22.029 --> 00:16:25.800
talk well of people who create
jobs

00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:28.310
the opposite of obama's which is higher
taxes

00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:31.450
more regulation anti-american energy

00:16:31.450 --> 00:16:33.650
and class warfare

00:16:33.650 --> 00:16:37.920
what was the result? and just objective
facts this goes back to the phrase empiricist

00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:40.330
uh... that was used at one point

00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:42.720
in september of nineteen eighty three

00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:47.200
we created a million one hundred
thousand jobs in one month

00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:50.500
under reagan job creational minimum was such
uh...

00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:52.689
that given our current population base

00:16:52.689 --> 00:16:57.030
it would be twenty five million new jobs

00:16:57.030 --> 00:16:58.220
so

00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:00.340
we slid back a little bit

00:17:00.340 --> 00:17:03.980
there was a tax increase i thought we were
in a recession

00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:08.440
i get elected speaker

00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:10.419
and what do i do?

00:17:10.419 --> 00:17:13.839
cut taxes cut regulations focused
on American energy

00:17:13.839 --> 00:17:16.760
support people who create jobs what was the
result?

00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:20.560
in the four years i'm speaker we create
eleven million new jobs

00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:23.540
unemployment drops to 4.2
percent

00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:29.100
now what's the fiscal consequence for
everybody's watching this idiotic supercommittee?

00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:31.220
fiscal consequence is simple

00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:34.860
when i went into office the congressional
budget office said in the next ten years

00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:36.289
the deficit would be

00:17:36.289 --> 00:17:39.390
two point seven trillion dollars

00:17:39.390 --> 00:17:42.960
when i left office after four years the
congressional budget office said

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:44.570
the surplus

00:17:44.570 --> 00:17:47.120
would be two point three trillion
dollars

00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:49.830
that's a five trillion dollars swing

00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:52.820
ironically nobody that i know of at the
budget committee

00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:54.289
on the super committee

00:17:54.289 --> 00:17:58.150
has reached out to anybody who's
actually balanced the budget

00:17:58.150 --> 00:17:59.370
and I'm the only speaker 

00:17:59.370 --> 00:18:02.820
in your life time to balance a budget for four
years

00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:05.080
uh... why did it happen like that?

00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:06.929
well if you if you create jobs

00:18:06.929 --> 00:18:10.610
you take people off of  medicaid off of
public housing

00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:13.679
off of food stamps off of unemployment

00:18:13.679 --> 00:18:17.530
off of welfare so you're reducing government
spending

00:18:17.530 --> 00:18:21.280
without paying you know you're not going
out here chopping people off

00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:23.510
they're leaving to go to work

00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:27.550
when they go to work they're paying
taxes so you actually have a reduction

00:18:27.550 --> 00:18:28.450
in cost

00:18:28.450 --> 00:18:31.690
a rise in unfor hire revenue, just again taxes

00:18:31.690 --> 00:18:34.049
you have a rise in revenue

00:18:34.049 --> 00:18:37.580
and the consequence of those is the
largest single step you ever take to a

00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:41.710
balanced budget

00:18:41.710 --> 00:18:46.910
so the third pillar or the third topic of conversation
you wanted to have with president Obama if you were the nominee

00:18:46.910 --> 00:18:50.500
was involving national security how would you keep
our country safe what do you see as our role in the

00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:52.180
world

00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:54.159
well i think first of all

00:18:54.159 --> 00:18:56.970
this would be moderate controversial

00:18:56.970 --> 00:18:59.080
we were in the world

00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:01.220
there's no conceivable

00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:02.780
isolationism

00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:04.130
that will work

00:19:04.130 --> 00:19:08.420
that's very important because once you start
out be saying we're in the world then you say okay,

00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:11.770
so if we if we are an exceptional unique
civilization

00:19:11.770 --> 00:19:14.970
how do we defend our interest in the
world how to express our values in the

00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:15.640
world

00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:18.799
and that becomes a very large and very
complex question

00:19:18.799 --> 00:19:20.250
i'll just take two examples

00:19:20.250 --> 00:19:22.460
let's take China and

00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:24.310
radical islam's

00:19:24.310 --> 00:19:27.120
both of which require fundamental thought

00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:30.210
the president just engaged in 
symbolic

00:19:30.210 --> 00:19:33.020
behavior in australia

00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:37.480
we're going to send twenty five hundred marines
to Australia

00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:39.600
now that's irritating the chinese

00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:43.860
but i doubt if it's impressiing them

00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:46.700
they have the largest army in the
world they have, you know, and the idea oftwenty five hundred

00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:47.789
marines

00:19:47.789 --> 00:19:52.230
i'm an army brat I express a certain bias
thos eof you who are marines semper fi

00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:56.799
I'm just telling you, twenty five hundred
marines aint enough

00:19:56.799 --> 00:19:59.530
and yet it is actually a useful thing to
do

00:19:59.530 --> 00:20:01.800
i'm not against doing it

00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:04.980
but it's not central to our relation
with China. if you really want to

00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:06.270
worry about china

00:20:06.270 --> 00:20:10.140
ironically you have to worry about the
united states what are the key factors

00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:11.830
rebuild our industrial base

00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:16.639
rebuild our science and technology base
rebuild our education system if we get

00:20:16.639 --> 00:20:20.059
america straight, the chinese won't catch up
with us in a hundred years

00:20:20.059 --> 00:20:23.730
if we don't get america straight the
chinese are gonna pass us 'cause we're stupid

00:20:23.730 --> 00:20:25.410
now it is not possible

00:20:25.410 --> 00:20:28.850
for us to make an argument with the chinese
that they owe it to us to be as dumb as 

00:20:28.850 --> 00:20:30.600
we are

00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:33.000
and so if we really want to compete
with china

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.800
we have got to focus and and this came
straight out of a art redman

00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:36.450
commission

00:20:36.450 --> 00:20:39.919
which i helped create with president
clinton and when i stepped down he asked me

00:20:39.919 --> 00:20:41.260
to serve on it

00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:44.180
uh... we spent three years studying
american national security reported in

00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:47.570
march of two thousand one we said the
greatest threat united states was a

00:20:47.570 --> 00:20:49.120
weapon of mass destruction

00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:53.220
went off in an american city probably by a
terrorist group we said the second greatest

00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:54.440
threat to the united states

00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:56.950
is the failure of math and science
education

00:20:56.950 --> 00:20:59.559
and the failure to invest in science and
technology

00:20:59.559 --> 00:21:03.490
and we then said what i thought was a
startling thing for a national security

00:21:03.490 --> 00:21:04.940
uh... report we said

00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:06.410
it is a greater

00:21:06.410 --> 00:21:10.360
threat than any conceivable conventional
war

00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:13.940
so i would argue that fixing the schools
fixing the industrial base

00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:20.110
rebuilding our investment in science and
technology are national security issues

00:21:20.110 --> 00:21:23.560
and if we do them right the chinese are
sort of irrelevant we don't do them

00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:24.210
right

00:21:24.210 --> 00:21:25.940
frankly we're in enormous trouble

00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:29.340
the middle east is totally different i was very sobered
a couple months ago

00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:34.650
general john abizaid who i believe is the
only four star general who is fluent in arabic

00:21:34.650 --> 00:21:37.299
was the head of the central command now retired

00:21:37.299 --> 00:21:39.279
but he's been saying

00:21:39.279 --> 00:21:45.110
our strategic deficit is greater than
our fiscal deficit

00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:49.480
and that's a very sobering way to think
about it. we are in a

00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:52.290
challenge in the middle east

00:21:52.290 --> 00:21:55.320
so much larger and more complex

00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:59.620
than anything our current foreign-policy
establishment can deal with

00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:00.390
that is very very

00:22:00.390 --> 00:22:01.850
sobering

00:22:01.850 --> 00:22:04.970
and i think we need to talk about it and in
that sense i don't think that i don't

00:22:04.970 --> 00:22:06.139
know that i'm a hawk

00:22:06.139 --> 00:22:08.820
so much as i am an owl I think we need wisdom

00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:13.750
in trying to deal with this because it
is a very very serious problem

00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:18.380
before we open up to the audience, I'm going to 
ask you a couple personal questions

00:22:18.380 --> 00:22:22.909
our mission at the IOP is to inspire students to pursue
careers in politics and public service

00:22:22.909 --> 00:22:26.049
why'd you decide to run for office the first time?

00:22:26.049 --> 00:22:26.929
I was

00:22:26.929 --> 00:22:29.310
originally going to be either a zoo director

00:22:29.310 --> 00:22:31.029
uh... or a 

00:22:31.029 --> 00:22:32.909
and i know what some of you are thinking

00:22:32.909 --> 00:22:37.750
it came in handy when you were speaker. well that is a
great book there's a great book by uh...

00:22:37.750 --> 00:22:41.010
uh... called a chimpanzee politics

00:22:41.010 --> 00:22:45.400
which i recommend to all of you which is a study of the
social structure of the arnhem zoo's

00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:47.240
chimpanzees colony

00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:50.440
but it's a really great introduction to politics
among large primates

00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:54.030
uh... 

00:22:54.030 --> 00:22:55.420
and it's a terrific book

00:22:55.420 --> 00:22:59.310
uh... but anyhow I was going to be either a
zoo director or a vertibraepaleontologist

00:22:59.310 --> 00:23:01.830
and uh...

00:23:01.830 --> 00:23:03.000
in the uh...

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:07.970
my dad was stationed in orleansfrance he was in
the infantry for twenty seven years

00:23:07.970 --> 00:23:09.460
and we

00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:12.710
late in my freshman year in high school

00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:15.149
we went to the battlefield Verdun

00:23:15.149 --> 00:23:19.280
which was the largest battlefield of
world war one about six hundred thousand

00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:22.179
french and german dead in a nine month period

00:23:22.179 --> 00:23:23.450
and um...

00:23:23.450 --> 00:23:25.919
stayed with a friend of my fathers who had

00:23:25.919 --> 00:23:29.390
uh... been drafted in nineteen forty one
sent to the philippines served in the

00:23:29.390 --> 00:23:30.750
bataan death march

00:23:30.750 --> 00:23:34.210
and ended up spending three and half years
in a japanese prison camp

00:23:34.210 --> 00:23:35.049
so

00:23:35.049 --> 00:23:38.950
we were talking all weekend about the
cost of defeat

00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:40.419
and then

00:23:40.419 --> 00:23:44.220
literally the french paratroopers came
in from algeria killed french fourth

00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:45.320
republic

00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:48.510
and brought de gaulle back to create the fifth
republic

00:23:48.510 --> 00:23:50.990
and shortly after that we moved to
stukgard

00:23:50.990 --> 00:23:54.549
so as a young kid from Harrisburg
pennsylvania I'm thinking

00:23:54.549 --> 00:23:58.320
this is all real. we used to
drive our bus to the 

00:23:58.320 --> 00:23:59.610
american school

00:23:59.610 --> 00:24:05.510
passed world war two bomb damage so
all of this was extraordinary real

00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:08.940
and i spent the summer thinking and
praying about it and in august of 

00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:11.940
1958 just before my sophmore year in
high school

00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:14.190
uh... i decided that

00:24:14.190 --> 00:24:16.210
my mission if you will

00:24:16.210 --> 00:24:17.909
uh... or my vocation

00:24:17.909 --> 00:24:19.040
uh... was too

00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:22.899
do three things understand what american
has to do to survive

00:24:22.899 --> 00:24:26.340
understand how to explain it to the
american people that let you do it

00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:29.870
and understand how you would implement it

00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:31.559
if they give me a shot

00:24:31.559 --> 00:24:33.820
so i from that point on have read books

00:24:33.820 --> 00:24:35.770
in the summer of nineteen sixty i was a
volunteer

00:24:35.770 --> 00:24:37.440
in the Nixon-lodge campaign

00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:38.799
went back to reading books

00:24:38.799 --> 00:24:41.740
and i went back and forth that way for my
whole career

00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:45.309
and so i've been actively this is my
fifty third year

00:24:45.309 --> 00:24:47.840
of trying to understand what we have to do 
as a country

00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:50.860
well my last question is one a student asked me to 

00:24:50.860 --> 00:24:52.549
ask you we're in a

00:24:52.549 --> 00:24:55.020
part of harvard named after president
kennedy

00:24:55.020 --> 00:24:59.250
who was the first catholic president of the United States and
the only catholic president to date

00:24:59.250 --> 00:25:02.660
uh... but a few years ago you converted to
catholicism what motivated that and how

00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:04.470
is that

00:25:04.470 --> 00:25:08.070
shift that in your uh... your faith
your uh...

00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:11.200
impacted your political beliefs

00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:12.789
if at all

00:25:12.789 --> 00:25:14.900
i think what happened was

00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:17.740
my wife Callista who all of you met earlier

00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:21.800
is a cradle catholic and sings in the
choir

00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:22.919
of the uh 

00:25:22.919 --> 00:25:27.100
basilica of the national shroud of the
immaculate conception the largest catholic church 

00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:28.460
in the United States

00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:30.610
and so just to be supportive

00:25:30.610 --> 00:25:33.000
I used to go every Sunday and watch

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.700
being a good husband. right and uh...

00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:40.230
plus given my musical skills I thought my
sitting in the audience was a terrific ...good spot for you

00:25:40.230 --> 00:25:41.309
yeah yet

00:25:41.309 --> 00:25:46.210
uh... but i found myself over time
i think part of my soul is medieval

00:25:46.210 --> 00:25:50.110
and so i found myself over time that the
basilica is an extraordinary

00:25:50.110 --> 00:25:53.130
institution and 

00:25:53.130 --> 00:25:56.210
i became more and more and more
comfortable and frankly more and more

00:25:56.210 --> 00:25:57.240
intrigued

00:25:57.240 --> 00:25:59.600
with the Catholic approach

00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:01.210
to the eucarist

00:26:01.210 --> 00:26:07.290
and i got involved in long conversation
with monsignor Rossi who was the

00:26:07.290 --> 00:26:09.789
director of the basilica

00:26:09.789 --> 00:26:12.710
and it just struck me that

00:26:12.710 --> 00:26:14.990
the combination of the intellectual background
of

00:26:14.990 --> 00:26:17.899
two thousand years of catholic
scholarship

00:26:17.899 --> 00:26:21.980
and the power of

00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:25.070
the representation of christ every sunday

00:26:25.070 --> 00:26:28.279
or everytime you go to mass seven days a week 
if you go seven days a week

00:26:28.279 --> 00:26:30.070
is an extraordinary

00:26:30.070 --> 00:26:31.760
experience

00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:33.240
when uh...

00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:36.870
Pope Benedict came and i got to know much deeper because

00:26:36.870 --> 00:26:38.549
the choir went to Rome

00:26:38.549 --> 00:26:41.750
and i went along it was one of the first
times in my life I actually took a week

00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:43.500
off i was the spouse

00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:47.820
uh... and when they were making a cd
recording a cd for

00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:49.300
pope john paul the second

00:26:49.300 --> 00:26:52.210
and so i had spent the afternoon and
evening relaxed

00:26:52.210 --> 00:26:54.990
and then they'd come back about eleven
o'clock and they'd decided to do all the recording

00:26:54.990 --> 00:26:58.400
in the evening when the church was that
they were in, the Santa Maria majority was

00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:00.179
closed to tourists

00:27:00.179 --> 00:27:03.580
and so Monseignor Rossi and i would talk and
then when they came back about eleven o'clock

00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:07.909
at night we'd go to some fabulous local
italian restaurant in Rome

00:27:07.909 --> 00:27:11.179
and my job was essentially to provide
the wine

00:27:11.179 --> 00:27:13.679
uh... and and so i was very popular with the choir

00:27:13.679 --> 00:27:17.770
and uh... i but the course of those
conversations started the process of

00:27:17.770 --> 00:27:19.550
thinking and talking about

00:27:19.550 --> 00:27:22.560
the role, the centrality of religion

00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:27.750
uh... and when pope benedict came I was allowed as a 
speaker of the House to be at the basilica

00:27:27.750 --> 00:27:30.110
when the bishops met with the pope

00:27:30.110 --> 00:27:32.390
and i happened to see him

00:27:32.390 --> 00:27:36.330
and there was something about the sense
of joy and and the fact

00:27:36.330 --> 00:27:37.080
uh...

00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:41.970
that he had chosen christ our hope which
i happen to believe is true, we're going all the way back to

00:27:41.970 --> 00:27:45.710
when my grandmother was raising me as a child my
grandmother

00:27:45.710 --> 00:27:48.510
when my mother was working my
grandmother sort of took over

00:27:48.510 --> 00:27:51.630
and was very intensely focused on
convincing me

00:27:51.630 --> 00:27:53.490
that there is heaven and that there is hell

00:27:53.490 --> 00:27:55.980
that there's an extreme difference the two
futures

00:27:55.980 --> 00:27:59.920
and that she was prepared to communicate
hell as vividly as needed for me to decide

00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:02.550
that heaven is a better choice

00:28:02.550 --> 00:28:03.899
and just

00:28:03.899 --> 00:28:07.919
so i tell people I didn't decide to
become Catholic, I gradually became

00:28:07.919 --> 00:28:09.260
catholic

00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:11.500
and woke up to that realization

00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:15.460
the biggest thing it's done for me is it
is a sense of being at peace with myself

00:28:15.460 --> 00:28:17.190
and that is really uh...

00:28:17.190 --> 00:28:19.649
the church is an extraordinary

00:28:19.649 --> 00:28:24.260
community within which to seek
reconciliation with God

00:28:24.260 --> 00:28:29.300
well we're gunns, now we're gunna invite the audience to
participate, we've got four microphones there's two on the

00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:30.500
floor

00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:34.750
there's two in the booth. we'll try to get
through as many questions as we can 

00:28:34.750 --> 00:28:40.809
just a couple reminders of our standard rules
here at j_f_k_ junior forum uh... please

00:28:40.809 --> 00:28:43.399
identify yourself and your harvard
affiliation

00:28:43.399 --> 00:28:44.379
uh... one

00:28:44.379 --> 00:28:47.179
brief question per questioner no speeches

00:28:47.179 --> 00:28:48.710
uh... we had one

00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:51.989
well ti wasn't really a speech but it's his show it's not your show

00:28:51.989 --> 00:28:55.799
uh... and the best questions are those that end
 with a question mark. and we  will

00:28:55.799 --> 00:28:58.190
start right here

00:28:58.190 --> 00:29:02.700
Hi my name is Denise Velasco and I'm a student here at the 
Kennedy School I'm a Mid-career PA candidate

00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:03.960
okay

00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:07.150
it was mentioned in the movie that

00:29:07.150 --> 00:29:09.559
american exceptionalism in part

00:29:09.559 --> 00:29:12.899
is the idea that it doesn't matter if
you're rich or poor and it doesn't

00:29:12.899 --> 00:29:15.220
matter who your parents are

00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:19.000
it's a sharp turn from immigration
legislation that you strongly supported

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:23.500
in nineteen ninety-six that would bar the
children of undocumented immigrants

00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:25.050
from schools

00:29:25.050 --> 00:29:26.380
how do you reconcile

00:29:26.380 --> 00:29:33.380
that contradictory idea that still pursists in your
party

00:29:35.090 --> 00:29:38.190
well i think we have a long tradition of
being the most open to immigration of

00:29:38.190 --> 00:29:39.809
any country in the world

00:29:39.809 --> 00:29:43.940
I think we have an extrodinary challenge, if you live
in a world of 7 billion people

00:29:43.940 --> 00:29:47.700
for whom probably uh... the number who would come here 
tomorrow morning if

00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:51.700
they could find a way to get here would
at least double population

00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:55.440
uh... so you have a permentation
I think the correct answer

00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:56.540
is to

00:29:56.540 --> 00:29:57.870
control the border

00:29:57.870 --> 00:30:01.630
and to find a way to have a guest worker program
that is effective

00:30:01.630 --> 00:30:04.220
and to find some kind of process

00:30:04.220 --> 00:30:07.570
i've suggested a world war two style
selective service model

00:30:07.570 --> 00:30:11.490
uh... which would allow you to to sort
out people who have only been here a

00:30:11.490 --> 00:30:13.559
short time and have no real ties

00:30:13.559 --> 00:30:14.850
who ought to go home

00:30:14.850 --> 00:30:18.700
and people been here a long time and have real ties and
the Creeble foundation has

00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:21.760
suggested what it would be calling a red card
program

00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:25.789
uh... as a way of uh... giving people a path to legality

00:30:25.789 --> 00:30:27.350
without having a path to citizenship

00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:29.470
and i'd like to see us get to a point
where

00:30:29.470 --> 00:30:32.190
everybody who remains in the u_s_ is
legal

00:30:32.190 --> 00:30:35.149
uh... and has access to all of the
assets of the united states

00:30:35.149 --> 00:30:39.970
but I think it's a process..even the children of undocumented
immigrants?

00:30:39.970 --> 00:30:44.850
if if they are here and go through this process and they 
end up with a
red card yes

00:30:44.850 --> 00:30:48.080
If they don't end up with a red card and they don't end up with a 
guest worker 

00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:48.870
permit

00:30:48.870 --> 00:30:50.630
then i would not allow them to stay here

00:30:50.630 --> 00:30:54.300
uh... which is why i think you've got to render judgment
]i don't think we're gonna take

00:30:54.300 --> 00:30:57.710
someone who's been here twenty three
years you know, has three kids

00:30:57.710 --> 00:31:00.000
and two grandkids and belongs to a local church

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:03.530
and has been totally law-abiding since
they got here i do not believe we're

00:31:03.530 --> 00:31:04.750
gonna kick them out

00:31:04.750 --> 00:31:08.010
and I think we've gotta have an honest conversation about
immigration reform

00:31:08.010 --> 00:31:11.850
not just each side yelling at eachother

00:31:11.850 --> 00:31:12.909
thank you. next question right here

00:31:12.909 --> 00:31:14.260
uh...

00:31:14.260 --> 00:31:17.850
first of all thank you very much for
coming here and speaking to us and for this

00:31:17.850 --> 00:31:18.710
interesting movie

00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:19.410
uh

00:31:19.410 --> 00:31:23.530
My name is bernard Metz I am an MPA 
a student at the kennedy school from

00:31:23.530 --> 00:31:25.050
europe

00:31:25.050 --> 00:31:28.970
and i have a question on what do you 
think about europe

00:31:28.970 --> 00:31:31.240
which part of Europe are you from?

00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:33.919
uh... Bavaria

00:31:33.919 --> 00:31:40.330
so the uh... movie and the definition
of exceptionalism.. I like beer

00:31:40.330 --> 00:31:50.520
everybody likes beer, ybut they don't like American
beer that much

00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:56.340
well actually I like guiness more because
I'm half Irish

00:31:56.340 --> 00:31:58.529
I actually like czech beer but that's a different story

00:31:58.529 --> 00:32:04.640
Pilsner urquel or? pilsner ukved

00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:10.260
so the movie base the
definition on of exceptionalism to

00:32:10.260 --> 00:32:11.590
a high degree

00:32:11.590 --> 00:32:13.789
uh...on differentiation from

00:32:13.789 --> 00:32:15.830
what was mentioned several times

00:32:15.830 --> 00:32:16.700
corrupt

00:32:16.700 --> 00:32:17.830
unfree

00:32:17.830 --> 00:32:20.039
europe and other parts of the world

00:32:20.039 --> 00:32:24.150
which was certainly true two hundred and
fifty years ago and i totally agree

00:32:24.150 --> 00:32:26.179
uh... that's

00:32:26.179 --> 00:32:28.580
that there were good reasons for coming
to

00:32:28.580 --> 00:32:30.889
the free united states

00:32:30.889 --> 00:32:33.700
but uh...

00:32:33.700 --> 00:32:37.600
then afterwards now you also mentioned
that you think that arnold Schwarzenegger 

00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:41.080
couldn't have become
president of austria

00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:42.640
so um...

00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:44.009
i'm wondering

00:32:44.009 --> 00:32:46.540
do you base your

00:32:46.540 --> 00:32:51.360
perception of europe on historical facts
or do you still think that europe is a

00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:57.070
dictatorship and if so.. i didn't say there was a 
dictatoship, essentially there is a  

00:32:57.070 --> 00:32:58.659
class system

00:32:58.659 --> 00:33:00.870
that is very hard to break through

00:33:00.870 --> 00:33:05.309
it's still true even in great britain, there are
extraordinary differences of class

00:33:05.309 --> 00:33:06.340
and and uh...

00:33:06.340 --> 00:33:10.330
who gets to rise and who doesn't the
political party systems are dramatically

00:33:10.330 --> 00:33:12.049
more closed there than they are here

00:33:12.049 --> 00:33:16.389
look look at our wild and wide open
political presidential races

00:33:16.389 --> 00:33:20.250
whether it's last time when the heir
apparent got defeated by Obama

00:33:20.250 --> 00:33:24.100
or is this time we can't figure out who
the front runner is because they don't last long enough

00:33:24.100 --> 00:33:29.039
uh... this is the most open to
talent system on the planet

00:33:29.039 --> 00:33:31.000
that's just an objective fact

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.160
but I was describing

00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:38.250
cultural and cast and societal behaviors
it had nothing to do with dictatorship

00:33:38.250 --> 00:33:42.990
uh... it has to do with the fact that
europe tends to be run by oligarchies

00:33:42.990 --> 00:33:46.330
who love cartels and who try to avoid the public

00:33:46.330 --> 00:33:49.570
by burying everything in bureaucracy just
look at, I did my dissertation 

00:33:49.570 --> 00:33:50.590
in brussels

00:33:50.590 --> 00:33:54.749
just got to look at the uh... the common
market bureaucracy in brussels and the

00:33:54.749 --> 00:33:58.009
degree to which it represents a
bureaucratic control of europe

00:33:58.009 --> 00:34:00.779
uh... hidden away from the average
person

00:34:00.779 --> 00:34:04.279
there is dramatically less democracy in europe
than there's united states

00:34:04.279 --> 00:34:08.119
there twenty five thousand bureaucrats 
in brussels running a system of five

00:34:08.119 --> 00:34:09.619
hundred million people

00:34:09.619 --> 00:34:10.710
uh... average

00:34:10.710 --> 00:34:14.019
city in the united states has more bureaucrats

00:34:14.019 --> 00:34:20.189
but ok, that's not a question so i'm done

00:34:20.189 --> 00:34:23.169
Hi Speaker i'm Holly Flynn i'm a freshman at the college

00:34:23.169 --> 00:34:26.800
and two details from your film really stood out to
me one was phyllis schlafly's

00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:28.099
commentary

00:34:28.099 --> 00:34:32.050
and the other was the characterization
of women winning world war two

00:34:32.050 --> 00:34:33.619
as a negative image

00:34:33.619 --> 00:34:36.739
so i'd like you to clarify your stance on women's
rights

00:34:36.739 --> 00:34:39.729
and i'd like to hear what you would do
to ensure

00:34:39.729 --> 00:34:41.159
gender equality

00:34:41.159 --> 00:34:43.079
in the united states given that

00:34:43.079 --> 00:34:47.509
even today women make seventy seven
cents to every man's dollar

00:34:47.509 --> 00:34:50.879
well

00:34:50.879 --> 00:34:54.909
the later is going to change dramatically in the next
generation because more women are going to

00:34:54.909 --> 00:34:56.099
college than men

00:34:56.099 --> 00:34:59.499
and they're doing better than men and they're entering
professions more than men

00:34:59.499 --> 00:35:02.020
and in fact if anything you'll be here
in fifteen years

00:35:02.020 --> 00:35:05.339
wondering what we do about male inequality and male 
unemployment

00:35:05.339 --> 00:35:07.759
because the people who've had the deepest
decline

00:35:07.759 --> 00:35:10.669
in income in fact are males who don't go to
college

00:35:10.669 --> 00:35:12.619
uh... but that will be another story another day

00:35:12.619 --> 00:35:14.089
um

00:35:14.089 --> 00:35:17.959
on schlafly's case the only thing that i thought schlafly
really talked about was that 

00:35:17.959 --> 00:35:21.499
if you redistribute wealth you took money
from somebody

00:35:21.499 --> 00:35:25.079
and you have to ask the moral question
by what right are you taking money

00:35:25.079 --> 00:35:27.260
why does this group on this side of the room

00:35:27.260 --> 00:35:30.680
have the right to take money from this
group on this side of the room i thought that was

00:35:30.680 --> 00:35:32.479
all that schlafly talked about

00:35:32.479 --> 00:35:35.929
uh... so i'm not quite, I understand you
may have other arguments with schlafly

00:35:35.929 --> 00:35:38.449
uh but it struck me that was the only thing

00:35:38.449 --> 00:35:41.649
and i think the point he is making about Rosie the riveter
 was not that rose the riveter

00:35:41.649 --> 00:35:43.039
wasn't important

00:35:43.039 --> 00:35:44.910
uh... i suspect he would have said

00:35:44.910 --> 00:35:49.510
had the same school taught about the
women's army air corps

00:35:49.510 --> 00:35:52.830
had they taught about women's roles in
ferrying aircraft

00:35:52.830 --> 00:35:55.169
etc, he would have found it much more appealing

00:35:55.169 --> 00:35:58.859
but he was trying to make a point about
the way we approach world war two

00:35:58.859 --> 00:36:04.119
world war two was probably as 
elegantly fought and as heroic a war as

00:36:04.119 --> 00:36:05.509
we've ever had

00:36:05.509 --> 00:36:08.559
and involved an enormous amount of sacrifice

00:36:08.559 --> 00:36:13.119
uh... and that is not the model that is
normally taught the example again

00:36:13.119 --> 00:36:16.800
uh... is is trying to discuss ever Heroshima and
Nagasaki

00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:18.999
without discussing pearl harbor

00:36:18.999 --> 00:36:22.509
or without discussing what the estimates
were of casualties

00:36:22.509 --> 00:36:25.229
if in fact we had not used the atomic
bomb

00:36:25.229 --> 00:36:28.189
I mean it's pretty to say well boy, that's really terrible
to use the atomic bomb

00:36:28.189 --> 00:36:30.459
it's pretty hard to say okay you're Harry Truman

00:36:30.459 --> 00:36:35.989
you're being told five million japanese
and a million americans will be killed

00:36:35.989 --> 00:36:39.149
now you've two choices which to do

00:36:39.149 --> 00:36:40.409
as uh

00:36:40.409 --> 00:36:42.919
charlton heston was one of the
eighteen-year-old paratroopers in

00:36:42.919 --> 00:36:44.550
training to go into japan

00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:47.189
he said he was eternally grateful

00:36:47.189 --> 00:36:49.079
because he frankly didn't think he'd live

00:36:49.079 --> 00:36:53.319
if you looked at iwo jima and you looked at
okinawa and you looked at the casulty rate

00:36:53.319 --> 00:36:55.889
and you projected and said what was this going to be
like

00:36:55.889 --> 00:36:59.019
now i think what that particular author is talking about

00:36:59.019 --> 00:37:02.329
is that there si a consistent biased
against

00:37:02.329 --> 00:37:04.940
american heroism american decency

00:37:04.940 --> 00:37:08.489
in the modern academic elites

00:37:08.489 --> 00:37:10.179
and on the floor

00:37:10.179 --> 00:37:14.449
thank you, my name is daniel fin i'm s midcareer 
MPA student here at harvard kennedy

00:37:14.449 --> 00:37:15.959
school for government

00:37:15.959 --> 00:37:20.780
for speaker for american exceptionalism mr speaker,
in nineteen ninety eight

00:37:20.780 --> 00:37:22.279
under your speakership

00:37:22.279 --> 00:37:24.649
the congress passed

00:37:24.649 --> 00:37:28.800
a uh... the foreign affairs reform and the
restructuring act

00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:30.549
which among other things

00:37:30.549 --> 00:37:33.879
abolished the US infomation agency

00:37:33.879 --> 00:37:37.619
no this has received uh... critisisms
uh... along the way

00:37:37.619 --> 00:37:40.340
the typical example is so four years
ago

00:37:40.340 --> 00:37:42.910
republican potential candidate 

00:37:42.910 --> 00:37:44.129
john mccain

00:37:44.129 --> 00:37:46.319
made it his

00:37:46.319 --> 00:37:47.850
campaign pledge

00:37:47.850 --> 00:37:50.390
to reestablishing the information agency

00:37:50.390 --> 00:37:51.809
now my question to you

00:37:51.809 --> 00:37:52.760
is uh...

00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:58.049
in hindsight do you think uh... it was a
mistake to abolish the agency in

00:37:58.049 --> 00:37:59.259
nineteen ninety eight

00:37:59.259 --> 00:38:03.549
and uh... would you seek if you uh...

00:38:03.549 --> 00:38:08.720
if you are the president, seek to re-establish
this agency or something to that effect

00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:12.400
to revitalize american public diplomacy

00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:15.390
uh... why and why not

00:38:15.390 --> 00:38:17.739
great question i think it was a mistake

00:38:17.739 --> 00:38:21.899
uh... i think we greatly underestimated
how much it would be in effect

00:38:21.899 --> 00:38:23.109
destroyed

00:38:23.109 --> 00:38:24.960
by the state department beaurocracy

00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:28.910
i strongly favor reestablishing a u_s_
information agency having it under an

00:38:28.910 --> 00:38:35.239
independent board and reverting to the model we used
so effectively in the cold war

00:38:35.239 --> 00:38:40.660
thank you mr speaker my name's christopher lloyd i'm a second
year student at the harvard business school 

00:38:40.660 --> 00:38:46.060
in your movie you talked about the importance virtue to the
idea of american exceptionalism and i was wondering if you

00:38:46.060 --> 00:38:53.060
could talk about some the ethical principles that drive your
decision making and also given some your public

00:38:53.389 --> 00:38:54.569
ethical lapses

00:38:54.569 --> 00:38:58.769
how can america be sure that you'd be a virtuous president?

00:38:58.769 --> 00:39:03.469
uh... well i think first of all that as a general rule what
the founding fathers meant by virtue

00:39:03.469 --> 00:39:06.699
was in fact their behavior in public
life

00:39:06.699 --> 00:39:09.779
and their committment to the country and their dedication
to the country

00:39:09.779 --> 00:39:11.819
and i think that in that sense

00:39:11.819 --> 00:39:15.739
as i said earlier i've spent fifty three
years trying to understand how to help save this

00:39:15.739 --> 00:39:20.159
country i've had a very long and
consistent career in terms of advocating

00:39:20.159 --> 00:39:24.439
a whole set of values that involves
smaller government lower taxes balanced

00:39:24.439 --> 00:39:25.799
budgets

00:39:25.799 --> 00:39:28.159
and strong american nationalism

00:39:28.159 --> 00:39:30.679
and i think you can look at my record
overall

00:39:30.679 --> 00:39:32.839
and then you have to decide for yourself

00:39:32.839 --> 00:39:34.169
but i think in terms of being 

00:39:34.169 --> 00:39:38.269
both consistent and willing to absorb
a pretty substantial beating from the

00:39:38.269 --> 00:39:39.669
elite media

00:39:39.669 --> 00:39:41.320
i'm probably

00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:44.609
uh... as willing to sacrifice for this country's future

00:39:44.609 --> 00:39:48.249
uh... as anybody you've seen in public
life in your lifetime and i do it

00:39:48.249 --> 00:39:51.119
because i think in the tradition of my
stepfather

00:39:51.119 --> 00:39:54.890
who as i said earlier was a career
infantryman for twenty seven years

00:39:54.890 --> 00:39:57.829
some citizens have to be enagaged directly

00:39:57.829 --> 00:40:03.169
uh... in trying to stand up for the
country

00:40:03.169 --> 00:40:04.349
speaker gingrich

00:40:04.349 --> 00:40:07.069
thank you for your service and for your
time

00:40:07.069 --> 00:40:09.449
my name is luke scanlan i'm a mid-career

00:40:09.449 --> 00:40:12.539
uh... m_p_a_ here at the kennedy school uh...

00:40:12.539 --> 00:40:14.489
and so i'm one of the

00:40:14.489 --> 00:40:17.429
conservative students here in the body

00:40:17.429 --> 00:40:20.829
and uh... we have a great time finding

00:40:20.829 --> 00:40:25.059
a lot of conversation with all of
our colleagues uh... as i recently told

00:40:25.059 --> 00:40:28.619
someone we've learned how to get along
despite our differences

00:40:28.619 --> 00:40:31.619
and understand better why that we don't 
disagree

00:40:31.619 --> 00:40:36.649
one of the things that many of us are
concerned about is corporate donations

00:40:36.649 --> 00:40:38.949
to campaigns and a fear

00:40:38.949 --> 00:40:42.829
that campaigns particularly politics can be
bought and no longer really truly

00:40:42.829 --> 00:40:44.069
accessible

00:40:44.069 --> 00:40:45.789
to everybody

00:40:45.789 --> 00:40:50.559
so as a president what are you going
to do about making sure that when we

00:40:50.559 --> 00:40:55.249
have donations that that does not
override the political process

00:40:55.249 --> 00:40:59.390
and something else along those lines is
how much time are people actually

00:40:59.390 --> 00:41:00.809
spending

00:41:00.809 --> 00:41:05.319
the people we elect, how much time are they
spending understanding politics verses

00:41:05.319 --> 00:41:08.569
out raising money for the next campaign

00:41:08.569 --> 00:41:12.989
it's a great, those are both great questions

00:41:12.989 --> 00:41:16.219
they're very important questions
and they

00:41:16.219 --> 00:41:19.389
i want to deal with them separately as they are so
important

00:41:19.389 --> 00:41:21.000
i think the entire

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:23.150
post-watergate

00:41:23.150 --> 00:41:27.559
micro-beaurocratization of politics has
been a disaster

00:41:27.559 --> 00:41:31.729
when you set a twenty five hundred
dollar cap on what people can give

00:41:31.729 --> 00:41:33.260
what you actually do

00:41:33.260 --> 00:41:37.159
is guarantee incumbents spend all their
time raising money

00:41:37.159 --> 00:41:41.259
and their goal is to create a mountain
so high that no challenger can match it 

00:41:41.259 --> 00:41:44.270
because the challenger has to go out and try to raise twenty
five hundred units

00:41:44.270 --> 00:41:46.029
and they can't do it

00:41:46.029 --> 00:41:49.489
uh... well some of you say well there's too much money
spent in politics and i'll just say to you

00:41:49.489 --> 00:41:51.209
this is a very expensive country

00:41:51.209 --> 00:41:53.769
look at the amount of money we spend for cat food

00:41:53.769 --> 00:41:58.419
look at the amount of money spent for deodorant
this is a very expensive country

00:41:58.419 --> 00:42:02.439
you're trying to deal with a government
that is a four trillion dollar government

00:42:02.439 --> 00:42:05.209
you're going to have a lot of money
spent in some form

00:42:05.209 --> 00:42:07.409
i think we'd be vastly better off

00:42:07.409 --> 00:42:13.479
to have a very simple law that says anyone
can give any amount of after-tax income

00:42:13.479 --> 00:42:16.580
as long as it is reported every night on
the internet

00:42:16.580 --> 00:42:19.420
and you would overnight reduce the
amount of time people spend raising

00:42:19.420 --> 00:42:20.549
money

00:42:20.549 --> 00:42:23.999
and you'd have people be able to say hey look you don't want
to donate to me that's fine

00:42:23.999 --> 00:42:28.799
i'm going to go over here, my experience was i've
never had to change a position

00:42:28.799 --> 00:42:30.010
in order to raise money

00:42:30.010 --> 00:42:33.129
i had to find the people who agreed with
my position

00:42:33.129 --> 00:42:36.569
and if i found people who agreed with my position
i could raise a fair amount of money

00:42:36.569 --> 00:42:40.449
uh... the second half of what he said
though i think is really a disaster at two

00:42:40.449 --> 00:42:43.199
different levels

00:42:43.199 --> 00:42:46.710
what's happened is we've grown a
consulting industry

00:42:46.710 --> 00:42:50.400
so that instead of having the old-time
big-city machine bosses you now have

00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:52.329
these consultants

00:42:52.329 --> 00:42:56.199
and these consultants earn a living and
sometimes an extraordinarily good living

00:42:56.199 --> 00:43:01.139
out of selling, out of buying advertising and
getting a percent of what they buy

00:43:01.139 --> 00:43:04.839
and so the consultants are very heavily
in favor of advertising and they're very

00:43:04.839 --> 00:43:08.139
heavily in favor of very simple-minded
candidates whose primary job is to raise

00:43:08.139 --> 00:43:10.880
money so the ideal consult model is

00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:12.599
you go out and raise money

00:43:12.599 --> 00:43:15.910
in order to hire me i will then write
talking points for you to get through

00:43:15.910 --> 00:43:19.970
the news program and i will then take
the money you have to write really

00:43:19.970 --> 00:43:23.940
vicious thirty second ads and push pull
polls and other things

00:43:23.940 --> 00:43:25.450
so you'll win the election

00:43:25.450 --> 00:43:28.209
and then you will arrive in washington
knowing nothing

00:43:28.209 --> 00:43:30.799
but when you get to washington you can
hire a chief of staff

00:43:30.799 --> 00:43:34.489
who will then write talking points for
you while you go to the

00:43:34.489 --> 00:43:37.519
you know, this isn't we back and study people like abe
lincoln

00:43:37.519 --> 00:43:39.549
or jefferson or washington

00:43:39.549 --> 00:43:43.149
or even up as late as FDR and and
and in a unique way ronald reagan who was

00:43:43.149 --> 00:43:47.839
totally an anomaly and outside the
normal system

00:43:47.839 --> 00:43:51.030
lincoln personally spends three months
researching

00:43:51.030 --> 00:43:53.149
his speech at cooper union

00:43:53.149 --> 00:43:55.469
he personally writes it

00:43:55.469 --> 00:43:58.979
he understands what is argument, he
knows what he is saying

00:43:58.979 --> 00:44:02.489
and i mean people talk about the
these debates recently

00:44:02.489 --> 00:44:06.619
you know the truth is i prepare for
debates seven days a week

00:44:06.619 --> 00:44:08.809
fifty two weeks a year

00:44:08.809 --> 00:44:11.439
and then sometimes a debate shows up

00:44:11.439 --> 00:44:15.399
but i don't go rushing around and say to
my team why don't you tell me the seven

00:44:15.399 --> 00:44:18.349
things i should memorize for this evening

00:44:18.349 --> 00:44:21.869
uh... i find and i just think that's
apalling because

00:44:21.869 --> 00:44:26.449
the person you elect has to go and
actually make real decisions

00:44:26.449 --> 00:44:32.819
and so i think i think this whole current
model has got to be fundamentally rethought 

00:44:32.819 --> 00:44:36.179
for off speaker gingrich i would just like to thank
you for your time

00:44:36.179 --> 00:44:39.159
uh... my name is sarah i'm a freshman at the
college

00:44:39.159 --> 00:44:40.719
and my question is

00:44:40.719 --> 00:44:44.150
uh... a recent study by researchers at
harvard business school and duke

00:44:44.150 --> 00:44:47.889
university found profound economic
inequality in the united states

00:44:47.889 --> 00:44:52.249
though wealth, twenty percent americans
hold eighty five percent of the wealth

00:44:52.249 --> 00:44:55.259
while the poorest forty percent hold less
than one percent

00:44:55.259 --> 00:44:57.539
and the oecd recently found

00:44:57.539 --> 00:45:03.609
that social mobility across generations in the united
states is among the lowest in the developed world

00:45:03.609 --> 00:45:07.379
if a core american value is that all
men and women are created equal are

00:45:07.379 --> 00:45:11.419
we upholding that value if for children born
into such profound inequality and if not

00:45:11.419 --> 00:45:13.779
how can we as a nation do better

00:45:13.779 --> 00:45:18.759
that's a good

00:45:18.759 --> 00:45:21.689
that's a very good question and i would say to
you that uh...

00:45:21.689 --> 00:45:25.509
the report you just read represents three
different parallel

00:45:25.509 --> 00:45:27.919
policies of government failure

00:45:27.919 --> 00:45:31.569
the third and most recent is
the collapse of housing values

00:45:31.569 --> 00:45:35.330
since the middle class build a large
part of its wealth around its homes

00:45:35.330 --> 00:45:38.410
when you have an across the board
collapse in housing value

00:45:38.410 --> 00:45:41.560
you just devalue a large part of the
savings of middle class

00:45:41.560 --> 00:45:44.050
and you guarantee an increase in the
inequality

00:45:44.050 --> 00:45:47.490
because of the scale of loss they have
because they disproportionately

00:45:47.490 --> 00:45:49.919
have their wealth captured in their homes

00:45:49.919 --> 00:45:51.149
uh... second

00:45:51.149 --> 00:45:54.409
the collapse of manufacturing and having had
a government policy which has been

00:45:54.409 --> 00:45:56.969
explicitly anti manufacturing

00:45:56.969 --> 00:46:00.070
means that people who are at the margins who
historically

00:46:00.070 --> 00:46:03.779
would've worked their way up and rick santorum
is actually totally right on this

00:46:03.779 --> 00:46:07.599
uh... the people who would have worked themselves
up through manufacturing jobs 

00:46:07.599 --> 00:46:09.079
don't have jobs

00:46:09.079 --> 00:46:13.489
and so you cut off the way in which
they would have risen so that they might

00:46:13.489 --> 00:46:17.519
well have a pretty good job working in a
blue collar factory while their child got a

00:46:17.519 --> 00:46:20.909
pretty good job running the blue collar
factory and their grandchild had a

00:46:20.909 --> 00:46:23.689
pretty good job owning the blue collar
factory

00:46:23.689 --> 00:46:27.069
today that first rung is gone

00:46:27.069 --> 00:46:30.499
third and this is something that no liberal
wants to deal with

00:46:30.499 --> 00:46:36.450
core policies of protecting unionization
and bureaucratization against children

00:46:36.450 --> 00:46:39.270
in the poorest neighborhoods crippling
them

00:46:39.270 --> 00:46:43.539
by putting them in schools that fail has
done more to create income inequality

00:46:43.539 --> 00:46:44.310
in the united states

00:46:44.310 --> 00:46:46.320
than any other single policy

00:46:46.320 --> 00:46:47.779
it is tragic

00:46:47.779 --> 00:46:49.970
what we do in the poorest neighborhoods

00:46:49.970 --> 00:46:51.359
in trapping children

00:46:51.359 --> 00:46:54.439
first fo all in child laws which are truly
stupid

00:46:54.439 --> 00:46:58.219
okay you say somebody you shouldn't go to
work before you're what fourteen sixteen

00:46:58.219 --> 00:47:00.419
years of age? fine

00:47:00.419 --> 00:47:02.759
you're totally poor

00:47:02.759 --> 00:47:06.789
you are in a school that is failing with
a teacher that's failing

00:47:06.789 --> 00:47:09.869
i tried for years to have a very simple
model

00:47:09.869 --> 00:47:13.889
most of these schools ought to get rid of the
unionized janitors have one master

00:47:13.889 --> 00:47:17.809
janitor and pay local students to take
care of the school

00:47:17.809 --> 00:47:19.460
the kids would actually do work

00:47:19.460 --> 00:47:20.790
they would have cash

00:47:20.790 --> 00:47:22.540
they'd have pride in the schools

00:47:22.540 --> 00:47:26.610
they'd begin the process of rising. you go
out and talk to as i do regularly talk to

00:47:26.610 --> 00:47:29.229
people who are really successful in one
generation

00:47:29.229 --> 00:47:31.210
they all started their first job

00:47:31.210 --> 00:47:34.049
between nine and fourteen years of age

00:47:34.049 --> 00:47:36.039
they all were either selling newspapers

00:47:36.039 --> 00:47:37.359
going door-to-door

00:47:37.359 --> 00:47:39.459
they were doing something they're washing
cars

00:47:39.459 --> 00:47:41.530
they all learned how to make money at a

00:47:41.530 --> 00:47:45.869
very early age what do we say the poor kids
in poor neighborhoods

00:47:45.869 --> 00:47:49.280
don't do it. i mean remember all the stuff about don't
get a hamburger-flipping job

00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:52.639
the worst possible advice to give to poor
children

00:47:52.639 --> 00:47:56.129
get any job that teaches you to show up on
monday

00:47:56.129 --> 00:48:00.889
get any job that teaches you to stay all day even if you 
have a fight with your girlfriend

00:48:00.889 --> 00:48:02.310
i mean the whole process of

00:48:02.310 --> 00:48:05.449
get making work worthwhile essential

00:48:05.449 --> 00:48:10.109
we have cut, and this is a huge, you put
your finger on it i take seriously

00:48:10.109 --> 00:48:13.680
that every american of every ethnic
background in every neighborhood

00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:15.490
has the right to pursue happiness

00:48:15.490 --> 00:48:17.180
and that it was endowed by their creator

00:48:17.180 --> 00:48:19.039
that means you're going to see from me

00:48:19.039 --> 00:48:21.709
extraordinarily radical proposals

00:48:21.709 --> 00:48:25.389
to fundamentally change the culture of
poverty in america and to give people a

00:48:25.389 --> 00:48:27.460
chance to rise very rapidly

00:48:27.460 --> 00:48:30.179
one last example jack kemp and i worked
in the eighties

00:48:30.179 --> 00:48:32.840
on a concept where people in public
housing

00:48:32.840 --> 00:48:36.099
could acquire sweat equity by taking
care of the public housing

00:48:36.099 --> 00:48:38.429
they could only overtime own the public
housing

00:48:38.429 --> 00:48:40.960
we were deeply attacked by liberals in
the congress

00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:43.290
who said do you realize in new york city

00:48:43.290 --> 00:48:46.880
if you allow poor people to acquire
ownership of their condominiums

00:48:46.880 --> 00:48:49.719
they could sell them for over a million
dollars

00:48:49.719 --> 00:48:52.309
and they wouldn't be poor anymore

00:48:52.309 --> 00:48:54.750
and we said yes do you realize what you
just said

00:48:54.750 --> 00:48:58.810
and the people most opposed to it were the 
housing unions

00:48:58.810 --> 00:49:01.690
who do not want to see the housing authority
replaced

00:49:01.690 --> 00:49:04.889
by poor people rising into the middle class
status

00:49:04.889 --> 00:49:06.549
i just shared those ideas

00:49:06.549 --> 00:49:08.800
we probably only have time for two more questions

00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:12.019
so this one and this one and try to keep them brief,
i apologize to the others

00:49:12.019 --> 00:49:16.029
mr speaker first thank you so very much
for your service and also thank you for your intellectual

00:49:16.029 --> 00:49:20.650
representation of conservatism i greatly
appreciate that on a personal level

00:49:20.650 --> 00:49:24.229
and on a level much bigger than myself and just
before getting to my question i want to remind

00:49:24.229 --> 00:49:25.809
everybody that

00:49:25.809 --> 00:49:29.429
disagreement does not need to
entail disrespect and unfortunately sitting

00:49:29.429 --> 00:49:33.609
in the audience having to listen to
snikers and sneers and all of that

00:49:33.609 --> 00:49:37.569
upon your video i find that quite
unfortunate that that could occur here 

00:49:37.569 --> 00:49:42.140
at such a wonderful university. now to get to my
question ok my name is justin smith an i'm

00:49:42.140 --> 00:49:46.869
an alum with the extension school so i
actually really did work my way into

00:49:46.869 --> 00:49:49.699
harvard you could say

00:49:49.699 --> 00:49:54.349
my question is this mr speaker many
characterize uh... a lot of the things that

00:49:54.349 --> 00:49:59.629
you have done uh... and as your tenure
as speaker and as a politician

00:49:59.629 --> 00:50:02.709
such as having the video afterwards with 
nancy pelosi and working with many

00:50:02.709 --> 00:50:08.449
democrats is going to be your achilles heel
in this primary but uh...

00:50:08.449 --> 00:50:12.499
don't you think you could characterize that
as your one really true advantage that in

00:50:12.499 --> 00:50:16.449
this time where things are so polarized as
we've seen with these ninety nine and

00:50:16.449 --> 00:50:20.519
one percenters and that and as you said we
are the hundred percent i mean

00:50:20.519 --> 00:50:24.759
isn't that your biggest advantage?

00:50:24.759 --> 00:50:26.729
well not necessarily my biggest advantage

00:50:26.729 --> 00:50:30.959
hahahahahahaha but look i i do think it's an
advanatge and frankly the

00:50:30.959 --> 00:50:34.289
palosi ad was a mistake, i've said it was juts a dumb ad

00:50:34.289 --> 00:50:37.300
but on the other hand i'm prepared to 
debate any

00:50:37.300 --> 00:50:38.649
conservative

00:50:38.649 --> 00:50:42.749
about the time i spent going around the
country with reverend al sharpton

00:50:42.749 --> 00:50:45.219
talking about the importance of charter
schools

00:50:45.219 --> 00:50:49.130
going into black neighborhoods where he
had real standing and where people listen

00:50:49.130 --> 00:50:49.909
to him

00:50:49.909 --> 00:50:53.919
and i would argue that that anyone who
truly wants to govern america

00:50:53.919 --> 00:50:57.479
has to be prepared to go into every
neighborhood of every background in the

00:50:57.479 --> 00:51:00.909
entire country and i can promise you
that if i'm invited by the 

00:51:00.909 --> 00:51:02.050
NAACP

00:51:02.050 --> 00:51:04.410
i will go and speak to the convention

00:51:04.410 --> 00:51:05.630
and if i'm invited

00:51:05.630 --> 00:51:09.970
uh... by by lulac or leros or
anybody else i will go and speak to their

00:51:09.970 --> 00:51:10.879
convention

00:51:10.879 --> 00:51:12.609
we have to become a country

00:51:12.609 --> 00:51:16.499
in which we're prepared to speak across
boundaries when we passed welfare reform

00:51:16.499 --> 00:51:19.160
it was a hundred and one democrats voting
yes

00:51:19.160 --> 00:51:21.629
and a hundred and one democrats voting
no

00:51:21.629 --> 00:51:24.819
it is possible to govern in a bipartisan
and remember

00:51:24.819 --> 00:51:27.309
nothing i accomplished as speaker

00:51:27.309 --> 00:51:30.669
would've become law without bill clinton's signature

00:51:30.669 --> 00:51:33.750
so you have, nothing that ronald reagan
would want to accomplish

00:51:33.750 --> 00:51:36.980
could get through the u_s_ house without
one-third of the democrats because

00:51:36.980 --> 00:51:38.649
o'neill was the speaker

00:51:38.649 --> 00:51:41.990
and so we had to peel away a third of
the democrats on every key vote

00:51:41.990 --> 00:51:44.390
in order to past things in reagan's first
term so

00:51:44.390 --> 00:51:49.259
i've got a long period of experience of doing
things this way and uh... do want to put in

00:51:49.259 --> 00:51:50.679
two quick commercials

00:51:50.679 --> 00:51:53.679
if you'd like to know more about what
i'm doing go to on first namw it's 

00:51:53.679 --> 00:51:54.569
newt.org

00:51:54.569 --> 00:51:59.319
and i do want to ask all of you to
consider, i'm not going to ask any of you to be for me

00:51:59.319 --> 00:52:02.559
because if you're for me you'll go
home and hope that i fix it

00:52:02.559 --> 00:52:05.279
i will ask you all to consider being
with me

00:52:05.279 --> 00:52:06.599
for the next eight years

00:52:06.599 --> 00:52:08.760
because this is going to be a tremendous struggle

00:52:08.760 --> 00:52:11.630
and i'll need you with me every day for eight
years

00:52:11.630 --> 00:52:15.929
to get this accomplished now you
had the last question

00:52:15.929 --> 00:52:20.969
yes my name is resvano rashano i'm with masters 
in public policy

00:52:20.969 --> 00:52:26.289
i would ask you to comment whetheror not you would
extend the

00:52:26.289 --> 00:52:31.210
concept that you presented before as the
american exceptionalism to the situation where

00:52:31.210 --> 00:52:33.739
a hundred and eighty countries in the world

00:52:33.739 --> 00:52:39.249
pay for example their dues to the united
nations and the united states does not

00:52:39.249 --> 00:52:41.099
but also ask you to

00:52:41.099 --> 00:52:43.520
say whether in your opinion it is american

00:52:43.520 --> 00:52:45.129
exceptionalism

00:52:45.129 --> 00:52:50.529
that the treaty against landmines for example
and the kyoto protocol

00:52:50.529 --> 00:52:51.549
are two things that

00:52:51.549 --> 00:52:54.529
most of the countries of the world have
signed up to

00:52:54.529 --> 00:52:57.549
and united states has not so

00:52:57.549 --> 00:53:01.349
with the greatest respect i'm going to
ask you yes or no if you become

00:53:01.349 --> 00:53:06.569
president of the united states will the
US fall back on its dues

00:53:06.569 --> 00:53:07.829
to the united nations

00:53:07.829 --> 00:53:09.549
will you sign

00:53:09.549 --> 00:53:15.519
the land mine treaty and will you sign the kyoto 
protocol thank you

00:53:15.519 --> 00:53:18.839
if all you want is a yes or no the answer is no

00:53:18.839 --> 00:53:22.880
kyoto protocol is incredibly written
to the advantage of the europeans

00:53:22.880 --> 00:53:26.300
and explicitly against our advantage it
couldn't get a single vote in the united

00:53:26.300 --> 00:53:27.590
states senate not even

00:53:27.590 --> 00:53:29.989
not a single liberal democrat voted for it

00:53:29.989 --> 00:53:32.499
because it was so badly written

00:53:32.499 --> 00:53:35.729
the land mine convention is a terrific
idea as long as you're not sending

00:53:35.729 --> 00:53:37.429
troops anywhere

00:53:37.429 --> 00:53:40.849
it's a terrible idea if in fact you're
sending troops anywhere so there are a

00:53:40.849 --> 00:53:45.299
lot of the reasons why the united states is
very cautious about these things

00:53:45.299 --> 00:53:47.499
uh... third

00:53:47.499 --> 00:53:52.049
i'm happy to consider paying dues
to the united nations, remember the current failure

00:53:52.049 --> 00:53:56.089
unesco for us to pay our dues is a
direct function of the fact

00:53:56.089 --> 00:54:00.569
that they have recognized the palestinian
authority in absolute violation of the

00:54:00.569 --> 00:54:04.969
oslo accords and in away which is a
fundamental violation of united states

00:54:04.969 --> 00:54:06.629
position on uh...

00:54:06.629 --> 00:54:08.359
uh... the problems in the middle east

00:54:08.359 --> 00:54:11.209
but i will also tell you i was co-chair

00:54:11.209 --> 00:54:16.259
of the united nations reform uh...
commission with uh... senator george

00:54:16.259 --> 00:54:17.539
mitchell

00:54:17.539 --> 00:54:20.220
and united nations was one of those perfect examples
of a place

00:54:20.220 --> 00:54:23.759
that has an image that has no
relationship to its reality

00:54:23.759 --> 00:54:27.959
uh... so i'm happy to represent american
exceptionalism and i suspect as

00:54:27.959 --> 00:54:30.329
president i would nominate somebody to
be

00:54:30.329 --> 00:54:32.230
uh... the un the un ambassador

00:54:32.230 --> 00:54:35.520
who would be very aggressive and
demanding reform un and 

00:54:35.520 --> 00:54:39.940
very aggressive in fighting against
ideas that are antithetical to the

00:54:39.940 --> 00:54:43.899
values and the interest of the united states i
have no interest

00:54:43.899 --> 00:54:46.880
in in any way abrogating america's
interest

00:54:46.880 --> 00:54:49.899
on behalf of some vague concept of
internationalism

00:54:49.899 --> 00:54:55.609
uh... that in fact i think has no context
in in the real world

00:54:55.609 --> 00:54:59.229
i want to thank you thank mrs gingrich
for a 

00:54:59.229 --> 00:55:06.229
very educational and entertaining evening. i want to thank
the audience for being so good please join me in thanking them
