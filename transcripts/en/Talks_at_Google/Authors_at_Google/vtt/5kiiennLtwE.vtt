[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.602 --> 00:00:06.810
DANIEL GEEY: I'm Daniel Geey.

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.800
The boring part is I'm a lawyer
a law firm called Sheridan's.

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.860
The exciting part is I do
football for my living, which

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.060
is actually quite cool.

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:19.970
And going back very briefly
to, literally, all the times I

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:21.440
used to go to Anfield--

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:24.360
I was a Liverpool fan
with Hal back in the day.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.650
As all you guys are, I'm
sure, some football fans,

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:30.830
the things that I always did
when I was a six-year-old

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.920
and still as a 37-year-old do
is talk about football all day

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.260
long, if it's in the
office or if it's actually

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:37.333
after on WhatsApp chat.

00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:38.750
Because he gets
really annoying on

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.800
WhatsApp as well actually, if
a results gone good or bad.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.530
But ultimately-- and the truth
is, with a lot of the work

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.410
that I've done, from a very
early age, what I actually

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:50.718
wanted to do was
talk about football.

00:00:50.718 --> 00:00:52.760
And I've been lucky enough--
and you'll hopefully

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.200
see the career
journey to a degree

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.670
about why and how I
managed to convert myself

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.930
from a regulations lawyer,
which doesn't sound as sexy,

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.150
to a football lawyer,
which sounds a bit sexy.

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.290
But all it is, is a
regulations lawyer in football.

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.500
And what I wanted
to also talk about,

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.640
firstly, is a little
bit about my journey

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.400
but, as importantly,
the type of stuff

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.870
that I do day-to-day
and the very nice impact

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:23.780
that my book, which has
just come out recently,

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:24.710
has had on that.

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.170
Now, apart from my
mum being very excited

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.320
about the book being
published, it's

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.930
thankfully been quite
well-received so far.

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.555
And what I want to try and talk
about in a little bit of detail

00:01:35.555 --> 00:01:38.930
are some of the myths that I
try and dispel in the book.

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.800
Usually, the first thing that
most of my friends and even

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.630
my family still
ask me is actually,

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.680
what do you do as
a football lawyer?

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.460
So what is it that you do
that pays the bills that's

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.730
cool enough to say that
you're a football lawyer

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:54.620
and work in the
football industry doing?

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.440
So very briefly,
it is as follows.

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.400
On a day-to-day basis, I tend
to work with players and agents.

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.850
So that is what I do.

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.430
That tends, traditionally,
to be behind a computer,

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.900
but very often is on
WhatsApp, is on my phone,

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.810
is on voice messages that come
to me sometimes at 4 o'clock

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:15.780
in the morning.

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.420
So I'll give you one
just brief example

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.020
of what happened to me the
day before transfer deadline

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.720
day-- so Wednesday evening.

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.840
I won't, obviously,
disclose confidential stuff.

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.050
But just to give you a flavor of
what tends to happen very often

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.810
is a message will come to
me from a client that may be

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.280
a club or a player or an agent.

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.035
Usually, it's an agent
or a club saying, right--

00:02:37.035 --> 00:02:37.785
this is happening.

00:02:37.785 --> 00:02:39.707
A deal's happening on
this particular day.

00:02:39.707 --> 00:02:41.540
We need you to just
have a little quick look

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.730
through the documents,
is always what they say.

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:49.988
And that happened actually at
1:45 AM on Thursday morning.

00:02:49.988 --> 00:02:51.530
Dan, there's a deal
that's happening.

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.072
You need to get on
a train somewhere.

00:02:53.072 --> 00:02:55.670
You need to get to the
meeting for lunch time,

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.470
try and conclude the
deal in the afternoon,

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.220
and then hopefully
everything will be done

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.630
before deadline day concludes.

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:04.820
And that type of stuff
happens very regularly.

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.280
The other cool element that
happens quite regularly

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:13.700
is when I tend to
know information

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.400
that nobody else knows,
which obviously is very cool.

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.330
But I need to be extremely
careful about telling anybody

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.220
this, especially
because my family are

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.710
the biggest blabbermouths
of all time as well.

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:25.490
And it happens.

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:28.700
Because I did a Liverpool
transfer over the summer.

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.880
I knew a lot of cool
stuff that was going on

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.040
and couldn't tell anybody.

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.990
And the brilliant
thing about it also

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:40.670
was that he was asking me
about particular deals that

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:42.155
were going on.

00:03:42.155 --> 00:03:46.170
And I couldn't even deny the
existence of what was going on.

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.830
So for about a week and a half,
I couldn't even reply to him.

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:52.040
So he thought I was just
being annoying, not replying

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.520
to the general rumor mill
that was going on generally.

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.770
But it was actually, because
one of the players that I

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:00.650
was working with was going to be
signing a deal with Liverpool.

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:01.850
And I couldn't even
tell my dad, obviously,

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:03.725
which is very important,
because he obviously

00:04:03.725 --> 00:04:06.020
wants to know the gossip and
what's going on generally.

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:08.870
But needless to say, as
soon as the deal happened,

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.810
I could then tell my dad and
my rest of my family, who

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:13.310
had no idea what was going on.

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.230
But I still couldn't tell them
anything interesting about what

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:16.449
happened in the deal,
because obviously that

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:17.760
was confidential too.

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.649
So that the type of stuff
that I tend to do is,

00:04:21.649 --> 00:04:24.275
unfortunately-- and the
glamorous side is great.

00:04:24.275 --> 00:04:26.150
You're working with so
many fantastic players

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:27.320
with great clubs.

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.060
They're spending lots of money.

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:33.440
It is, without doubt, the
most terribly stressful hours

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.130
of my life on a regular basis
when the window is cropping

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:38.660
up or finishing or concluding.

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.812
Because you're managing risk.

00:04:42.812 --> 00:04:44.270
On one sense, you
want to make sure

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:45.860
that the deal
completes, because you

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.410
don't want to be at blame if
it has anything to do with you.

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:50.535
You are still trying to
communicate quite difficult

00:04:50.535 --> 00:04:53.930
legal concepts to your clients
to explain what the risk is

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:55.730
of particular things happening.

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:57.710
And at the same
time also, you're

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:01.820
trying to make sure that you
are being proactive-- you're

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:04.560
thinking about solutions
and things generally

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:05.640
are going to plan.

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:07.360
And you want to look unruffled.

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.480
And looking unruffled
and feeling unruffled

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.430
are two quite different
things at times.

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:15.090
So that's just a very brief
way of a background as to what

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:17.100
I actually do day-to-day.

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.480
So about me-- we've
had the intro.

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:22.210
This is where it all
began is the truth.

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:28.240
So my seat was just above the
directors' box-- about there.

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.520
And as you can imagine,
there's this big pole.

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:35.700
That got in the way of the goal
basically, which is a problem.

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:37.940
So me and my bro had
to alternate games--

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:38.690
had to swap seats.

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:40.773
So one of us could see the
main goal and one of us

00:05:40.773 --> 00:05:43.080
couldn't for a particular
game, which worked out well.

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:44.495
Now, this is the old stadium.

00:05:44.495 --> 00:05:45.870
So it's now a
cantilever stadium.

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:49.320
So it's slightly better.

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:52.420
How did I get
involved in football?

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:56.570
So very briefly-- what happened
in law school at university

00:05:56.570 --> 00:06:00.120
was that I asked my tutor,
literally off the cuff,

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.310
can I write about
the Bosman ruling?

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:04.470
And the Bosman ruling
was Jean-Marc Bosman,

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:08.280
back in the day, in
1990, wasn't allowed

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:11.790
to transfer to a new club
after the end of his contract--

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:13.410
after it even expired.

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:15.480
And that started a
very big landmark case

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:18.210
which, five years
later, actually resulted

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:20.340
in what's called the
free movement of players

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:21.390
across Europe.

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:24.540
Which meant that, after a
player's contract had finished,

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:26.460
they could move on
a free transfer.

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:29.100
And the selling club
didn't have to demand

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:30.990
and couldn't demand
a transfer fee.

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:32.490
So I thought, what
a brilliant thing

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:35.430
to possibly, in third
year uni, write about,

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:38.700
which was the Bosman ruling,
the transfer system changing,

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:39.990
and how things would work.

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:42.390
And they let me write about
it, which was even better.

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:44.610
After that, I
actually just tried

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:47.820
to persuade my dad for me to
spend an extra year at uni,

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:50.610
which he was happy for me to do
if I did something interesting.

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:53.938
I did a masters in football
broadcasting rights.

00:06:53.938 --> 00:06:55.980
It didn't sound as
interesting because, actually,

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:58.147
underpinning it was competition
law, which obviously

00:06:58.147 --> 00:07:00.420
is not quite as sexy
as football law,

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:03.150
but at the same time meant
that I could spend the best

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:06.780
part of about nine or 10 months
writing about how broadcasting

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:09.930
rights are sold across
Europe, which is cool.

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:11.577
And it meant that
I could get out

00:07:11.577 --> 00:07:13.410
of the real world for
one more year before I

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:15.990
had to start working.

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:19.028
As a result of that
masters degree,

00:07:19.028 --> 00:07:20.820
I had a little bit of
spare time at the end

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:22.080
of the year, which
actually meant

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:23.490
that my tutor said
to me, instead

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:25.380
of actually just
slacking off, why did you

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:27.840
write in a couple of law
journals about the things

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:29.285
that you've written about.

00:07:29.285 --> 00:07:31.410
Great-- OK, I could do
that-- didn't think anything

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:31.980
would happen.

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:34.260
But in a fantastic
way, they were

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:37.020
happy to publish something about
the football industry, which

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:39.927
was broadcasting rights
and about club ownership.

00:07:39.927 --> 00:07:41.760
"The Entertainment Law
Review," at the time,

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:45.225
published those two articles
in a few months spells.

00:07:45.225 --> 00:07:47.100
But what I actually
realized afterwards that,

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:49.290
as well is it was
great for my ego--

00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:52.530
fantastic getting in "The
Entertainment Sports Journal,"

00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:57.060
great to have the publicity,
fantastic to show a few people

00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:58.195
and have it on my CV--

00:07:58.195 --> 00:08:00.570
the truth was-- I don't mean
to say it badly against "The

00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:03.060
Entertainment Law Review"--
maybe only about eight people

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:04.270
read it.

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:05.700
It's the truth.

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:09.342
And you'll soon find out
from a little bit of the talk

00:08:09.342 --> 00:08:10.800
that I give in a
little bit of time

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:13.620
is, what I actually realized,
as much as it was really

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:16.650
good for the ego, because
no one was reading it,

00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:20.167
I actually needed to increase
my profile to a degree.

00:08:20.167 --> 00:08:21.750
And the way that I
actually did that--

00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:24.420
I'd met my wife Holly in 2007.

00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:28.320
And quite quickly, we
talked about all the stuff

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:30.581
that I could do in my job
and wanted to do in my job.

00:08:30.581 --> 00:08:32.789
She actually then said to
me, well, hold on a second.

00:08:32.789 --> 00:08:35.520
Why are you writing
5,000 or 6,000 words

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:37.260
for an entertainment
law journal when

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.900
you could be writing 500
words on your own blog,

00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:42.750
free, that everybody could
be able to then access

00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:44.330
and read accordingly.

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:45.913
And I actually
thought, you know what?

00:08:45.913 --> 00:08:47.550
It's actually a
pretty good idea.

00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:51.270
And so what I ended
up doing was not

00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:53.370
necessary not writing
in law journals

00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:55.860
overall but,
ultimately, deciding

00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:58.470
to start my own website,
which is DanielGeey.com,

00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:03.750
and then effectively
start writing small pieces

00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:06.840
about trying to demystify the
football industry to a degree,

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:08.430
even though actually,
at the time,

00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:11.220
I wasn't doing a huge
amount of work in football.

00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:12.220
I was doing small bits.

00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:14.790
It was hopefully increasing in
the type of work I was doing.

00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:17.610
But I wasn't doing huge
amounts at that time.

00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:20.340
And it came,
actually, at a very--

00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:23.400
fruitful is the wrong word--
but a really interesting time

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:24.780
in the football industry.

00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:26.670
There was financial
fair play, which

00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:27.990
I'll talk about in some detail.

00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:29.760
There was third-party
ownership, which

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:31.650
was a big thing at the time.

00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:35.080
Luis Suarez came to the country.

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:37.440
And obviously, he
had a lot of issues

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:41.280
with racism, with
biting, with suspensions.

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:44.580
John Terry matter
came up as well.

00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:46.750
And Nicolas Anelka
happened at the same time.

00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:49.230
So what was actually happening--
which is quite cool--

00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:54.030
is that there were lots of
cases and lots of issues that

00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:54.690
the public--

00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:57.760
the wide fans-- really
wanted to know about.

00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:00.180
And what I had-- a little
bit more time before kids

00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:03.530
and marriage-- was to be
able to read these cases,

00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:06.950
try and explain what they
meant for the average fan,

00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:08.660
and try and get beyond the--

00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:12.710
Luis Suarez is a racist
or it's a three match

00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:16.100
ban for fouling
somebody or, actually,

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:18.800
if you look at the detail of a
particular case, it means that

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:20.020
or it means this.

00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:22.170
And what I developed--

00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:25.880
which was great-- was quite a
strong follower base on Twitter

00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:29.300
as well, which was a great
amplifier of my blogs,

00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:32.900
to be able to then put
forward easily-accessible,

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:36.050
easily-digestible 500,
600, 700-word blogs

00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:37.990
that people were interested in.

00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:39.740
And then what happened
as a result of that

00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:41.810
was that journalists--

00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:44.330
Sky Sports-- all the
types of broadcast media--

00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:48.320
were then interested in having
me on their shows really,

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:49.730
which was great.

00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:54.530
And that in itself
then drove the profile

00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:57.080
that I was able to drive
for myself and my firm.

00:10:57.080 --> 00:11:01.220
I was able then to refine
my message that I wanted

00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:02.660
to get across to people--

00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:05.930
and in turn, led
me then to that,

00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:07.790
which was from blog to book.

00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:10.490
So I used to give a lot
of comments and commentary

00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:12.680
to people in the
football industry.

00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:14.527
Someone-- a
journalist-- said, why

00:11:14.527 --> 00:11:16.610
don't you think about
writing a book on the topic?

00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:17.750
And I said, oh, great idea.

00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:19.167
I don't think
anyone will actually

00:11:19.167 --> 00:11:20.870
think and be interested in it.

00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:23.810
He introduced me to an
agent, David Luxton,

00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:26.690
who is bizarrely my agent,
which is quite strange to say,

00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:28.560
but nice as well.

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:30.240
And he is, in effect,
the miracle worker

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:34.040
that got my proposal that I
put to him out to five or six

00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:36.080
different publishers.

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:39.200
There was quite a long process
in that to actually get

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:41.270
the all-clear to actually
then get the deal

00:11:41.270 --> 00:11:42.470
and to write the book.

00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:45.200
And then, more or less,
three years later--

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:47.210
from starting to
get the proposal

00:11:47.210 --> 00:11:51.270
to finishing the book-- we
are there with "Done Deal."

00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:57.470
So that is the book that came
out a few weeks ago that,

00:11:57.470 --> 00:11:59.505
so far, has done really well.

00:11:59.505 --> 00:12:01.130
I don't know how many
copies, actually,

00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:05.150
Mum has bought in order to
actually skew the Amazon

00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:06.570
algorithm accordingly.

00:12:06.570 --> 00:12:10.430
But in any event, everyone's
happy at the moment in the Geey

00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:12.770
household, which is
nice to the extent

00:12:12.770 --> 00:12:15.037
that, when I told my
daughters actually

00:12:15.037 --> 00:12:17.120
that I had a book being
published-- my oldest one,

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:20.390
Izzy is 6 and my youngest
one, Livy, is 3 and 1/2.

00:12:20.390 --> 00:12:21.950
I told her was writing a book.

00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:24.950
And the teacher then, at
the next teacher's meeting,

00:12:24.950 --> 00:12:29.330
then came in and said, oh,
it's fantastic that you're

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:31.160
involved in the book industry.

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:33.982
I didn't realize that
you were a librarian.

00:12:33.982 --> 00:12:35.690
Because Izzy had told
her that I'd become

00:12:35.690 --> 00:12:38.780
a librarian, because
I'd written a book.

00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:40.670
So that's my new
pastime, as well as

00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:42.410
being an author and a lawyer.

00:12:42.410 --> 00:12:48.050
So book out-- and what I
wanted to share with everybody

00:12:48.050 --> 00:12:51.390
for the next 15, 20
minutes, hopefully,

00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:55.850
if this works all right, is just
a few insights into the world

00:12:55.850 --> 00:13:01.580
of football, which I see on a
daily basis and what is covered

00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:02.870
and uncovered in the book--

00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:04.650
but just talking about
particular things.

00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:07.400
So you'll see at the top--
transfer fees, shirt sales,

00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:13.060
agents, boots deals,
appearances, and image rights--

00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:18.410
some of the more interesting
elements that I think and hope

00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:19.520
will be of value.

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:22.220
And please feel free
to ask questions

00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:24.012
and to delve into some
of the things I say.

00:13:24.012 --> 00:13:26.303
I think we're going to keep
the questions, if possible,

00:13:26.303 --> 00:13:26.810
to the end.

00:13:26.810 --> 00:13:29.018
But just hold your questions,
because I'm always very

00:13:29.018 --> 00:13:30.480
keen on audience participation.

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:32.600
So the most you're able to ask--

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:33.248
the better.

00:13:33.248 --> 00:13:34.040
I'm looking at Tom.

00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:35.320
Please, be careful
about the questions.

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:37.400
Because you probably know as
much as me about some football

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:37.900
stuff.

00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:39.570
So don't show me up
too much, please.

00:13:39.570 --> 00:13:42.120
OK-- number 1--

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:46.670
a 35 million pound transfer
actually isn't a 35 million

00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:47.480
pound transfer.

00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:49.688
Now, I know it sounds
slightly counterintuitive.

00:13:49.688 --> 00:13:51.480
But I promise, I'll
try and explain myself.

00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:54.050
So when you look at the
back page of a story

00:13:54.050 --> 00:13:56.690
and the back page of a
newspaper, you'll see,

00:13:56.690 --> 00:13:59.580
player moves for
35 million pounds.

00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:03.380
And that's a fee,
basically, that the club

00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:05.220
has paid for that player.

00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:06.665
Yes, that is the case.

00:14:06.665 --> 00:14:09.650
But what I want to drill down
to is actually the liability

00:14:09.650 --> 00:14:12.380
that the clubs--
the buying club--

00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:14.240
has to incur for that player.

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:18.200
Now, if we talk about just
the transfer fee for a second,

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:20.360
the transfer fee
is, effectively,

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:24.830
the amount that the buying
club pays to the selling club.

00:14:24.830 --> 00:14:26.780
The buying club pays-- obvious.

00:14:26.780 --> 00:14:28.670
But what isn't
usually as obvious

00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:31.010
is actually how
that is structured.

00:14:31.010 --> 00:14:34.010
So in most deals that I
see and have come across,

00:14:34.010 --> 00:14:36.200
what actually happens
is there's what's

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:41.210
called a fixed and a contingent
element to a transfer fee--

00:14:41.210 --> 00:14:44.960
the fixed bit being paid
regardless of anything over

00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:47.540
a particular period of time--
usually, the first, second,

00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:50.030
and third anniversaries
of the transfer--

00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:53.600
and the contingent being
if certain bonuses are met.

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:57.060
Certain conditions are met,
which mean bonuses are paid.

00:14:57.060 --> 00:14:59.070
So if I give the 35
million pounds example,

00:14:59.070 --> 00:15:00.200
it may be, for example--

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:01.760
I'll try and do the math right--

00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:04.080
that 15 million
pounds is paid upfront

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:05.850
at the time of the transfer.

00:15:05.850 --> 00:15:07.590
And then, maybe on
the first anniversary,

00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:09.220
5 million pounds is paid.

00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:11.220
Maybe on the second
anniversary of the transfer,

00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:12.900
another 5 million
pounds is paid.

00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:15.205
So that takes it to
25 million pounds.

00:15:15.205 --> 00:15:16.830
It may be that for
the next 10 million,

00:15:16.830 --> 00:15:19.470
in order to be paid,
the buying club has

00:15:19.470 --> 00:15:21.480
to win the Champions
League or the buying club

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:24.330
has to win the Premier
League, for example.

00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:27.630
And if those performance
measures aren't hit,

00:15:27.630 --> 00:15:31.005
then that extra 10 million
will never be paid.

00:15:31.005 --> 00:15:33.380
It actually gets a little bit
more complicated than that.

00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:35.150
Because usually what
has to happen is,

00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:38.150
as well as the club
winning those trophies,

00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:40.850
the player has to appear in a
certain amount of those games--

00:15:40.850 --> 00:15:46.310
i.e. he has to contribute to
that season's worth of success.

00:15:46.310 --> 00:15:48.200
Now, that's the first element.

00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:51.470
So 35 million pounds doesn't
usually mean 35 million pounds.

00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:54.660
It actually might only
mean 25 million pounds

00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:57.590
and certain contingencies
as a result.

00:15:57.590 --> 00:16:00.160
The other element, which is
not factored into any of that,

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:02.290
is the player's wages.

00:16:02.290 --> 00:16:04.000
Now obviously,
the player's wages

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.213
are usually the
biggest liability

00:16:07.213 --> 00:16:08.380
over the length of the deal.

00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:10.990
If a player signs
a five-year deal,

00:16:10.990 --> 00:16:14.440
let's say, for
200,000 pounds a week.

00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:15.940
That could add,
over five years--

00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:17.482
I was trying to do
the calculations--

00:16:17.482 --> 00:16:21.040
possibly 50 million
pounds worth of liability

00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:25.060
over and above the transfer fee
that might only be 25 million.

00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:26.980
So the point is, when
you see that headline

00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:29.230
at the back page
of the newspaper,

00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:32.420
saying, 35 million
pound transfer, think,

00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:35.950
actually, the first thing is,
it might not be a 35 million

00:16:35.950 --> 00:16:36.610
pound transfer.

00:16:36.610 --> 00:16:40.090
But actually, the main liability
is actually the player's wages.

00:16:40.090 --> 00:16:42.400
So a 35 million pound
transfer may actually

00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:45.760
be, if everything is included,
over 100 million pounds

00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:48.460
worth of liability that's
taken into account.

00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:50.710
And the other thing that
needs to be take into account

00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:51.790
is the agent's fee.

00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:54.760
But we'll talk about that
in just a second as well.

00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:57.340
So myth number one--

00:16:57.340 --> 00:16:59.680
35 million pound transfer
isn't usually a 35 million

00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:00.538
pound transfer.

00:17:00.538 --> 00:17:02.080
It's a lot less,
but also a lot more.

00:17:05.359 --> 00:17:07.772
Number 2-- I see this
quite a lot as well--

00:17:07.772 --> 00:17:10.230
I feel I'm spending more time
on this side of the room than

00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:13.880
on this side of the room--
sorry, I'll try and do this--

00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:16.430
is as follows.

00:17:16.430 --> 00:17:24.220
Without fail, Pogba, Zlatan,
Mane at Liverpool, Salah--

00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:25.290
whoever else it may be.

00:17:25.290 --> 00:17:28.830
Every time a big transfer
happens, the first thing

00:17:28.830 --> 00:17:29.830
that you'll always see--

00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:32.020
Beckham, back in
the day-- is-- ah--

00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:34.390
the clubs will recoup
most of the transfer fee

00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:39.460
from the shirt sales
that they will then make

00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:43.740
as a result of the transfer.

00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:47.650
I can't say, categorically,
that this absolutely never

00:17:47.650 --> 00:17:48.940
ever happens.

00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:52.480
But I absolutely doubt
that it ever happens,

00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:54.190
for the following reason.

00:17:54.190 --> 00:17:56.590
So try and give an example.

00:17:56.590 --> 00:17:58.540
And this is only from
public information.

00:17:58.540 --> 00:18:01.720
Because Manchester United, for
example, are floated in the US.

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:05.260
So they have to provide certain
information to investors,

00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:07.120
on a quarterly basis anyway.

00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:09.930
It's reported that
Ed Woodward states,

00:18:09.930 --> 00:18:11.560
in some of those
quarterly reports

00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:13.930
and what is published, that
Manchester United makes

00:18:13.930 --> 00:18:19.590
75 million pounds a year from
their Adidas apparel deal.

00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:21.070
They make 75 million
pounds a year.

00:18:21.070 --> 00:18:23.195
That decreases if they
don't get into the Champions

00:18:23.195 --> 00:18:25.010
League over a particular
period of seasons.

00:18:25.010 --> 00:18:25.760
But on the whole--

00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:26.810
75 million a year.

00:18:26.810 --> 00:18:29.360
And I think it's a 10-year deal.

00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:34.660
So almost coming up to 1 billion
pounds for a 10-year deal--

00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:37.660
750 million pounds
over 10 years.

00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:41.470
Now, what usually happens in
these very, very big shirt

00:18:41.470 --> 00:18:46.300
deals is, effectively,
those apparel companies

00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:50.170
are paying a very big
advance for the right

00:18:50.170 --> 00:18:53.170
to be able to then
exploit the brand

00:18:53.170 --> 00:18:54.670
and to be able to
sell those shirts.

00:18:57.580 --> 00:18:59.210
This isn't the Q&amp;A part.

00:18:59.210 --> 00:19:04.900
But just very quickly--

00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:07.240
how many shirts do you
think Manchester United sell

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:09.580
on a yearly basis?--

00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:10.918
just very quickly.

00:19:10.918 --> 00:19:11.710
Shout out a figure.

00:19:11.710 --> 00:19:12.460
AUDIENCE: 100,000.

00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:14.430
DANIEL GEEY: 100,000-- higher.

00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:16.454
I'm doing a Bruce
Forsyth thing here--

00:19:16.454 --> 00:19:17.650
AUDIENCE: 15 million.

00:19:17.650 --> 00:19:19.360
DANIEL GEEY: 15 million shirts--

00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:21.703
that's quite a difference.

00:19:21.703 --> 00:19:22.565
AUDIENCE: Basically.

00:19:22.565 --> 00:19:23.000
DANIEL GEEY: Yeah.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:24.030
AUDIENCE: Yeah-- not
the ones in Bangkok.

00:19:24.030 --> 00:19:24.863
DANIEL GEEY: Pardon?

00:19:24.863 --> 00:19:25.740
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:26.110
It is.

00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:27.430
AUDIENCE: Do they
sell real shirts?

00:19:27.430 --> 00:19:28.660
DANIEL GEEY: Well, that's
another big question,

00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:30.827
fake or real shirts, is
that you could [INAUDIBLE]..

00:19:30.827 --> 00:19:33.190
Let's just say, authentic
shirts, retailing

00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:35.343
for over 50 pounds a shirt.

00:19:35.343 --> 00:19:36.010
AUDIENCE: 5 mil.

00:19:36.010 --> 00:19:37.010
DANIEL GEEY: 5 million--

00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:40.540
OK, so the last figures were,
from a season and a 1/2 ago,

00:19:40.540 --> 00:19:42.520
that Manchester United,
on a yearly basis,

00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:45.160
sold 2.9 million shirts.

00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:48.220
Or rather Adidas or whoever
the manufacturer was--

00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:49.735
2.9 million shirts.

00:19:49.735 --> 00:19:51.610
I'm not sure that's more
than a lot of people

00:19:51.610 --> 00:19:53.068
think or less lots
of people think.

00:19:53.068 --> 00:19:57.130
I get varying degrees
of surprise either way.

00:19:57.130 --> 00:20:00.520
The point being
that, usually, what

00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:02.620
will happen in those
type of agreements

00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:04.510
is there will be this advance.

00:20:04.510 --> 00:20:05.600
This is paid every year.

00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:10.990
But after that, there may not be
anything more paid as a result

00:20:10.990 --> 00:20:15.220
to the club by way of amounts.

00:20:15.220 --> 00:20:18.250
Usually, there will be
performance-related amounts.

00:20:18.250 --> 00:20:22.060
But that only kicks in after a
certain amount of shirt sales

00:20:22.060 --> 00:20:24.860
are made on a yearly basis.

00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:26.680
So it may well be--
and I don't know--

00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:29.470
that Adidas don't pay
anything more to Manchester

00:20:29.470 --> 00:20:33.400
United per year over the
75 million pounds mark

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:34.460
that they do.

00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:37.900
And when I say pay, what I
mean is share in the revenue.

00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:42.670
But let's say, for example, that
Manchester United and Adidas

00:20:42.670 --> 00:20:46.480
share some revenue after
they hit 2 million shirt

00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:48.720
sales a year.

00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:50.480
And usually, that share--

00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:52.610
that royalty-- whatever
you want to call it--

00:20:52.610 --> 00:20:54.590
is actually probably
only 10% or 20%

00:20:54.590 --> 00:20:57.530
of the overall
additional amount.

00:20:57.530 --> 00:20:59.600
So let's just, without
wanting to confuse anyone

00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:01.225
in too much detail,
say that, actually,

00:21:01.225 --> 00:21:03.110
Manchester United,
for every shirt sold

00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:07.377
over 2 million shirts, maybe
gets 10 pounds per shirt.

00:21:07.377 --> 00:21:09.710
So you don't need me to do
the math very quickly for you

00:21:09.710 --> 00:21:12.730
to work out that one of the
biggest clubs in the world

00:21:12.730 --> 00:21:16.700
are not making huge amounts
of money from shirts sales

00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:18.350
over and above the
amounts that they're

00:21:18.350 --> 00:21:22.270
getting from their apparel
manufacturer straight away.

00:21:22.270 --> 00:21:24.710
Now, the other question
to also add into the mix

00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:27.497
as well on that is--

00:21:27.497 --> 00:21:29.330
and it's something that
no one's really done

00:21:29.330 --> 00:21:31.970
too much empirical evidence in.

00:21:31.970 --> 00:21:39.380
Would a marginal fan
by an additional shirt

00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:41.090
with the new player's name on?

00:21:41.090 --> 00:21:43.820
Or were they already going to
buy that shirt with an existing

00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:45.660
player's name on?

00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:47.370
Which also fits
into the narrative,

00:21:47.370 --> 00:21:50.990
which is, it doesn't mean
that an absolutely new fan is

00:21:50.990 --> 00:21:54.450
going to be buying an
absolutely new player's shirt.

00:21:54.450 --> 00:21:56.060
It may be that they'll
buy that shirt,

00:21:56.060 --> 00:21:58.685
but were going to buy it anyway,
regardless of which the player

00:21:58.685 --> 00:21:59.690
was going to be.

00:21:59.690 --> 00:22:02.630
So second myth hopefully
dispelled in a little bit

00:22:02.630 --> 00:22:04.880
of detail-- which
is, very rarely,

00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:07.850
whenever you read the headline
of, "Shirt sales will make

00:22:07.850 --> 00:22:10.730
fortunes for the club,"
usually, they won't.

00:22:13.915 --> 00:22:16.040
Sorry-- it's a
little bit smaller.

00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:19.980
But you're going to have to
strain to be able to read it.

00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:22.500
I know that the
question of agents

00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:26.340
is always quite a
topical issue generally.

00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:30.960
The narrative of
agents is that they

00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:33.665
don't do a great job
for players or clubs,

00:22:33.665 --> 00:22:35.040
that they take
too much money out

00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:36.630
of the game in terms
of commissions,

00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:41.550
and that their approach is
wheeler-dealer, at best.

00:22:41.550 --> 00:22:43.660
I have a slightly
vested interest, in that

00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:45.225
I work with a lot of agents.

00:22:45.225 --> 00:22:47.100
But the book-- hopefully,
you'll see as well,

00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:48.990
if you're able to read it--

00:22:48.990 --> 00:22:50.610
gives a slightly
different narrative

00:22:50.610 --> 00:22:52.530
to the usual
narrative, which is,

00:22:52.530 --> 00:22:55.140
agents are just bad guys
doing bad things all the time.

00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:58.020
And nobody likes them at all.

00:22:58.020 --> 00:23:00.440
The difference with a lot
of the very good agents

00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:03.630
is, they're extremely
well-networked, very

00:23:03.630 --> 00:23:07.590
diligent in what they
do, work incredibly hard

00:23:07.590 --> 00:23:09.930
in a very, very
insecure industry.

00:23:09.930 --> 00:23:12.268
And when I mean insecure
industry, I mean,

00:23:12.268 --> 00:23:14.310
they've worked very hard
to get very good players

00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:15.000
on their books.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:16.810
And probably, at
every other window,

00:23:16.810 --> 00:23:19.260
another agent is trying to
poach their player to say,

00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:21.510
I can get you a better deal
or I can get that for you.

00:23:21.510 --> 00:23:22.830
I can do this for you better.

00:23:22.830 --> 00:23:25.350
I'm not saying, all of a
sudden, poor agents doing

00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:26.970
a terrible job on the breadline.

00:23:26.970 --> 00:23:29.250
But the vast majority
of agents are not

00:23:29.250 --> 00:23:34.011
earning the huge sums that
are reported in the media.

00:23:34.011 --> 00:23:36.480
And the point of what
I'm trying to get to here

00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:38.820
is that there is an
interesting narrative which

00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:42.840
works in the media, which is,
look how much agents take out

00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:43.650
of the game.

00:23:43.650 --> 00:23:46.147
And look how much
clubs pay agents.

00:23:46.147 --> 00:23:48.480
And this is the thing that I
think a lot of people maybe

00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:52.710
don't quite grasp in the same
amount of detail that I've been

00:23:52.710 --> 00:23:56.580
able-- to be able to work in
the industry for some time is--

00:23:56.580 --> 00:23:59.857
players don't pay their agents.

00:23:59.857 --> 00:24:01.690
So I just want that to
sink in for a second.

00:24:01.690 --> 00:24:03.398
Because before I
started in the industry,

00:24:03.398 --> 00:24:05.250
it seemed quite a
strange concept to me.

00:24:05.250 --> 00:24:10.150
It's like, if I'm a player
and Hal is my agent.

00:24:10.150 --> 00:24:13.360
And Hal does a move
for me to a new club,

00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:16.150
I thought that I would pay
him, because my contract

00:24:16.150 --> 00:24:17.650
is with him.

00:24:17.650 --> 00:24:20.500
I'll pay you a percentage
of my earnings.

00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:22.860
And that's the way that
things work generally.

00:24:22.860 --> 00:24:24.680
But the way that
things tend to work,

00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:26.620
at least in the UK
and other countries,

00:24:26.620 --> 00:24:31.810
is, in order to incentivize the
player to move to their club,

00:24:31.810 --> 00:24:36.410
the club pays the players agent.

00:24:36.410 --> 00:24:38.394
Does that make sense?

00:24:38.394 --> 00:24:40.580
OK.

00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:44.030
And that has caused
controversy because,

00:24:44.030 --> 00:24:47.240
on the whole, that
means that fans

00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:51.320
see their club paying agents.

00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:53.000
And they see the
amounts that they

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:58.070
pay agents and don't like the
amounts that they pay agents.

00:24:58.070 --> 00:25:00.740
And where It can get a little
bit tricky for the player--

00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:03.082
and I don't want to go
into too much tax detail,

00:25:03.082 --> 00:25:04.790
because this is
certainly not a tax talk.

00:25:04.790 --> 00:25:07.415
And I don't want to get involved
in that type of stuff as well.

00:25:07.415 --> 00:25:09.927
But the one thing that
actually then becomes quite--

00:25:09.927 --> 00:25:12.260
I already heard someone who's
heard too much about taxes

00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:14.840
as well.

00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:17.618
The one thing that's important
just to stress about that

00:25:17.618 --> 00:25:23.510
is that is seen as what's
called a "taxable benefit."

00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:26.030
The club paying
the player's agent

00:25:26.030 --> 00:25:27.860
is what's called a P11D benefit.

00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:32.790
It's like what medical insurance
or a company car would be.

00:25:32.790 --> 00:25:36.260
So even though the player
isn't paying his agent,

00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:39.920
he has to pay tax on the
club paying his agent.

00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:42.620
And if that is one of
the most important things

00:25:42.620 --> 00:25:45.320
that I actually see when
a transfer happens--

00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:46.760
is that there's
been so many times

00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:49.220
when the player, 18
months on from a transfer,

00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:52.310
will get a big tax
bill from HMRC.

00:25:52.310 --> 00:25:54.620
And the player will say,
well, hold on a second.

00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:56.660
Why have I got a tax bill?

00:25:56.660 --> 00:26:00.292
The club has paid my
agent on my behalf.

00:26:00.292 --> 00:26:02.250
And then, if the agent
hasn't done a great job,

00:26:02.250 --> 00:26:03.958
unfortunately, the
agent says, ah-- yeah.

00:26:03.958 --> 00:26:07.310
But there was still a tax
bill to be paid on that.

00:26:07.310 --> 00:26:10.490
And what usually happens
for very savvy agents,

00:26:10.490 --> 00:26:13.280
when a transfer is happening--
and we see this more and more--

00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:16.310
and I'm sure you guys will have
heard of a similar equivalent--

00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:18.830
in the employment
contract, an agent

00:26:18.830 --> 00:26:22.250
will negotiate what's
called a gross-up clause.

00:26:22.250 --> 00:26:25.730
And a gross-up clause
is a miraculous payment

00:26:25.730 --> 00:26:30.480
which comes one week before
HMRC's tax bill comes along.

00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:35.060
Which means that then the player
doesn't feel the money going

00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:37.970
out of his account, because
it's more or less going straight

00:26:37.970 --> 00:26:40.230
to HMRC.

00:26:40.230 --> 00:26:41.910
Which actually is
a very clever thing

00:26:41.910 --> 00:26:43.800
for the agent to do really.

00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:46.710
Because otherwise, they will--
and I've seen it time and time

00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:47.400
again--

00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:49.860
get into an awful lot of
trouble with the player

00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:51.360
when the player has
to basically pay

00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:55.740
1/2 of the agent's fee in
tax to the tax authorities

00:26:55.740 --> 00:26:57.510
at the right time.

00:26:57.510 --> 00:26:59.010
So they're the type
of things that--

00:26:59.010 --> 00:27:00.180
yeah-- you see day-to-day.

00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:02.440
But the point
generally being is--

00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:04.560
even though it feels
counterintuitive,

00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:09.027
almost always, the player
will never pay his agent.

00:27:09.027 --> 00:27:10.610
And we'll talk about
what the thing is

00:27:10.610 --> 00:27:11.860
in the future that's going on.

00:27:11.860 --> 00:27:14.510
I think, there's a
possibility that that

00:27:14.510 --> 00:27:16.820
may change with the new
FIFA regulations that

00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:19.870
are being implemented.

00:27:19.870 --> 00:27:23.870
Next-- boot deals
are complicated.

00:27:23.870 --> 00:27:25.710
OK-- so just very briefly--

00:27:25.710 --> 00:27:27.960
and I'm always
interested in doing--

00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:30.160
and actually, I do use
the Google Analytics

00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:35.440
tool for my website, to be
able to understand, actually,

00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:37.930
which are people's favorite
blog posts, more or less,

00:27:37.930 --> 00:27:40.210
and what have I had
the most views from.

00:27:40.210 --> 00:27:44.870
The blog that I did on boot
deals is, by far and away,

00:27:44.870 --> 00:27:48.370
the blog that I've had my most
views on in my entire history

00:27:48.370 --> 00:27:49.863
of writing any blogs.

00:27:49.863 --> 00:27:51.655
And the reason why I
think, hopefully, it's

00:27:51.655 --> 00:27:56.780
hit an interesting point is--

00:27:56.780 --> 00:27:59.350
most people think that
a boots deal-- i.e.

00:27:59.350 --> 00:28:00.550
when a player signs a deal--

00:28:00.550 --> 00:28:02.800
and it may be for goalkeepers
with their goalie gloves

00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:05.140
as well-- for their shin
pads and their boots--

00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:08.830
that all they are paying for is
the ability of the player, when

00:28:08.830 --> 00:28:12.940
they go on the pitch, to use
their boots and shin pads

00:28:12.940 --> 00:28:15.550
and, maybe, have a
couple of appearances

00:28:15.550 --> 00:28:16.960
and some promotional stuff.

00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:19.780
So you've seen Messi
last week for Pepsi--

00:28:19.780 --> 00:28:24.340
but he used his Adidas shoes
for the promotional videos,

00:28:24.340 --> 00:28:26.470
et cetera.

00:28:26.470 --> 00:28:29.260
So it more or less means this.

00:28:29.260 --> 00:28:34.810
Whenever I see a boots deal, if
it's with Puma, Adidas, Nike,

00:28:34.810 --> 00:28:38.620
New Balance, Under Armor--
whoever else it may be--

00:28:38.620 --> 00:28:43.870
in almost every situation,
it doesn't cover just boots.

00:28:43.870 --> 00:28:46.240
So just a quick straw poll--

00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:52.290
who thinks a boots deal
should cover headphones?

00:28:52.290 --> 00:28:53.215
Anybody?

00:28:56.330 --> 00:28:57.290
Yeah-- 2.

00:28:57.290 --> 00:28:58.160
Thank you.

00:28:58.160 --> 00:29:01.030
You got a head start there.

00:29:01.030 --> 00:29:05.718
The scope of a
boots deal is vast.

00:29:05.718 --> 00:29:07.760
And there's two particular
caveats and carve-outs

00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:08.990
that I see quite a lot.

00:29:08.990 --> 00:29:11.570
One is, with most
manufacturers, they

00:29:11.570 --> 00:29:15.830
will try and carve out as much
as possible into their scope

00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:20.310
that they can then exploit for
the player to be able to use.

00:29:20.310 --> 00:29:23.600
So headphones is a big one.

00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:27.260
Shampoo and skin care
is another big one.

00:29:27.260 --> 00:29:31.460
Any types of electrical
goods is another one.

00:29:31.460 --> 00:29:36.840
Does anyone think Armani
is a competitor of Puma?

00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:40.500
Apparently, in some
boot deals, it is.

00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:41.730
not giving Puma as example--

00:29:41.730 --> 00:29:44.790
but the general point
is that, if possible,

00:29:44.790 --> 00:29:47.520
what a brand is
looking to try and do

00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:51.810
is to create the biggest
scope as possible for a player

00:29:51.810 --> 00:29:54.660
not to be able to
endorse anything else--

00:29:54.660 --> 00:29:55.380
is the truth.

00:29:55.380 --> 00:29:59.220
Because it gives them,
ultimately, a bigger window

00:29:59.220 --> 00:30:03.510
to be able to put and dress
the player up in all of their

00:30:03.510 --> 00:30:06.240
gear all the time.

00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:08.820
And also, the point worth
mentioning as well is--

00:30:08.820 --> 00:30:11.520
just, if you've signed a
Nike deal, for example--

00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:15.780
it obviously goes without saying
that you shouldn't be going out

00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:17.850
wearing Adidas trainers.

00:30:17.850 --> 00:30:20.370
But ultimately, the
practical reality

00:30:20.370 --> 00:30:23.940
is that, if you are signing
a long-term Nike deal,

00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:26.550
you're probably not going
to be able to wear Adidas

00:30:26.550 --> 00:30:29.110
for the next five years at all.

00:30:29.110 --> 00:30:30.230
And if you do--

00:30:30.230 --> 00:30:32.790
bear in mind, if you do
wear any competitor--

00:30:32.790 --> 00:30:35.090
and especially a
direct competitor--

00:30:35.090 --> 00:30:40.580
it's pretty likely
your deal is over--

00:30:40.580 --> 00:30:43.340
almost very likely
your deal is over.

00:30:43.340 --> 00:30:46.040
So that's the one thing on
the brand alignment and scope

00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:46.670
points.

00:30:46.670 --> 00:30:48.920
The other bit that's quite
interesting, I think, also,

00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:50.840
on boot deals is the amounts.

00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:54.620
So the agent may say to
the player, OK, fantastic.

00:30:54.620 --> 00:30:59.240
You're going to earn 500,000
euros a year for your deal.

00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:00.380
And the player says, great.

00:31:00.380 --> 00:31:02.040
Great news-- great to hear.

00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:05.660
There's one annex at the
back of most boots deal

00:31:05.660 --> 00:31:09.900
contracts, which always
scares me whenever I see it.

00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:11.900
And the reason why it
scares me to a degree

00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:15.590
is because it is a
direct table, which

00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:17.510
relates to the
amount of appearances

00:31:17.510 --> 00:31:21.930
that the player has to make
on a yearly or seasonal basis.

00:31:21.930 --> 00:31:24.687
So what usually
happens is the table--

00:31:24.687 --> 00:31:26.270
if he's an international
player, which

00:31:26.270 --> 00:31:28.730
the big players
are, obviously, who

00:31:28.730 --> 00:31:30.050
are getting the bigger money.

00:31:30.050 --> 00:31:32.630
It will say, you have
to perform or appear

00:31:32.630 --> 00:31:37.570
in 80% of your
club team matches.

00:31:37.570 --> 00:31:40.600
And you have to appear in 70%
of your international club

00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:41.100
matches.

00:31:41.100 --> 00:31:44.830
And if you don't, the retainer--
which is the overall amount--

00:31:44.830 --> 00:31:50.710
reduces by 40% and
sometimes bigger, depending.

00:31:50.710 --> 00:31:53.540
And it depends on how you
want to negotiate that.

00:31:53.540 --> 00:31:56.200
So one of the important
elements is for two things.

00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:58.810
We want to try and negotiate
hard on those points.

00:31:58.810 --> 00:32:02.560
But secondly-- to make sure the
player's aware of that point.

00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:04.920
Now, there's another question
to all of that, which is--

00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:07.128
and I'll talk about it in
the next slide to a second.

00:32:07.128 --> 00:32:09.080
But I want to just
briefly mentioned it here.

00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:10.538
And this is obviously
where lawyers

00:32:10.538 --> 00:32:11.740
get involved a lot more.

00:32:11.740 --> 00:32:16.940
What do you think the
definition of an appearance is?

00:32:16.940 --> 00:32:18.386
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:23.660
Exactly-- all of that
is exactly right.

00:32:23.660 --> 00:32:27.400
Is it appearing in
the matchday squad?

00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:30.310
Is it being on the pitch?

00:32:30.310 --> 00:32:31.630
Is it starting on the pitch?

00:32:31.630 --> 00:32:32.860
Is it ending on the pitch?

00:32:32.860 --> 00:32:34.300
Is it 5 minutes?

00:32:34.300 --> 00:32:35.020
Is it 10 minutes?

00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:37.300
Is it 20?

00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:38.890
That is one of the
most important--

00:32:38.890 --> 00:32:39.235
I'm going to talk--

00:32:39.235 --> 00:32:40.943
I think it might be
the next slide, which

00:32:40.943 --> 00:32:43.050
we'll go onto quite nicely.

00:32:43.050 --> 00:32:44.365
Perfect-- I'm seamless.

00:32:46.980 --> 00:32:51.420
That is one of the most
important definitions

00:32:51.420 --> 00:32:54.660
in a contract that I
will tend to deal with.

00:32:54.660 --> 00:32:58.110
Because ultimately,
for a boots deal,

00:32:58.110 --> 00:33:01.902
if an appearance can simply
be 10 minutes in a game,

00:33:01.902 --> 00:33:03.360
you can obviously
imagine that it's

00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:07.560
very much easier to be able
to get to that 70%, 80%, 90%--

00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:09.240
whatever percent
threshold in order

00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:13.690
to maintain your retainer
amount in your boot deal.

00:33:13.690 --> 00:33:17.530
But most importantly, in an
employment contract setting,

00:33:17.530 --> 00:33:20.650
this is very, very,
very strategically

00:33:20.650 --> 00:33:23.560
important for an agent and
a player to know about,

00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:27.380
as you can imagine-- but
usually for two reasons.

00:33:27.380 --> 00:33:32.890
The first is, when an agent
is negotiating his player's

00:33:32.890 --> 00:33:40.480
employment contract, there is
much more consideration given

00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:44.275
to variable pay, rather
than fixed pay, as there

00:33:44.275 --> 00:33:45.400
has been in previous years.

00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:48.520
And what I mean is, fixed is,
you will get 50,000 pounds,

00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:51.070
regardless if you play 1
minute, whether you're not

00:33:51.070 --> 00:33:52.840
even in the squads,
and it doesn't

00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:54.370
matter whether you play or not.

00:33:54.370 --> 00:33:55.630
That's the fixed amount.

00:33:55.630 --> 00:33:58.030
The player always knows that
he will get that amount,

00:33:58.030 --> 00:34:01.720
regardless of how he
plays or what he does.

00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:04.510
What a lot of the elite
clubs are doing now

00:34:04.510 --> 00:34:06.730
is trying to reduce
the fixed amount

00:34:06.730 --> 00:34:09.850
and increase the variable
amount, which is--

00:34:09.850 --> 00:34:13.239
if you play and
if you win, you'll

00:34:13.239 --> 00:34:17.800
get more than if
you would have just

00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:22.960
had your 50,000 amount every
week and a little bit extra.

00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:25.947
So the incentive,
effectively, is

00:34:25.947 --> 00:34:27.489
that, if you think
you're good enough

00:34:27.489 --> 00:34:29.139
to play on our first
team, you should

00:34:29.139 --> 00:34:32.268
take a lower fixed amount
and a higher variable amount.

00:34:32.268 --> 00:34:34.810
Because we're good enough, which
means you're going to appear

00:34:34.810 --> 00:34:35.853
and you're going to win.

00:34:35.853 --> 00:34:38.020
And therefore, you'll be
remunerated better than you

00:34:38.020 --> 00:34:39.508
otherwise would have done.

00:34:39.508 --> 00:34:41.050
But you can see,
obviously, the point

00:34:41.050 --> 00:34:43.929
that I'm trying to get at here,
which then becomes the point--

00:34:43.929 --> 00:34:48.699
appearance becomes very, very
important as a definition.

00:34:48.699 --> 00:34:52.690
Because the bonus element for
the employment contract is,

00:34:52.690 --> 00:34:55.870
appearance fee will
give you a bonus.

00:34:55.870 --> 00:34:58.810
Now as you can imagine then,
it's exactly all the points

00:34:58.810 --> 00:34:59.563
that you said.

00:34:59.563 --> 00:35:01.480
Does an appearance mean--
and it usually does,

00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:03.000
in a lot of instances--

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:06.387
starting a Premier League match?

00:35:06.387 --> 00:35:07.720
That's what it can sometimes be.

00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:09.430
And there could be
caveats throughout.

00:35:09.430 --> 00:35:11.805
There was a different bonus
for starting a Premier League

00:35:11.805 --> 00:35:14.800
match to an FA Cup match
to a Champions League match

00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:17.320
to a League Cup match
to a friendly match.

00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:19.108
That's how varied it can be.

00:35:19.108 --> 00:35:20.650
And they can be
different win amounts

00:35:20.650 --> 00:35:22.060
for all of those competitions.

00:35:22.060 --> 00:35:23.900
And sometimes, they
can be merged together.

00:35:23.900 --> 00:35:25.840
So it's an appearance
and win bonus,

00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:28.850
in order to get the bonus.

00:35:28.850 --> 00:35:33.160
So obviously, as you can
get to now, an appearance

00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:35.680
and how that is defined
is crucial, as to

00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:39.370
whether a player may
get the bonus or not.

00:35:39.370 --> 00:35:41.350
For an agent, he'll want
to try and make sure

00:35:41.350 --> 00:35:44.633
that 1 minute on that pitch
classifies as an appearance.

00:35:44.633 --> 00:35:46.300
Whereas, the club
will want to make sure

00:35:46.300 --> 00:35:49.510
that it's a start
in the first team

00:35:49.510 --> 00:35:51.717
squad for a particular
game, which means

00:35:51.717 --> 00:35:53.800
it's harder, obviously,
for the player to do that,

00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:57.512
if he's injured, out the
form-- whatever else it may be.

00:35:57.512 --> 00:35:59.470
The other element of when
an appearance becomes

00:35:59.470 --> 00:36:02.060
very important is-- because
sometimes, in a contract,

00:36:02.060 --> 00:36:04.127
there'll be a ratchet effect.

00:36:04.127 --> 00:36:05.710
And what that will
be is, after you've

00:36:05.710 --> 00:36:10.210
played in 20 games, 40
games, 60 games, 80 games,

00:36:10.210 --> 00:36:13.016
your salary will go up
accordingly as well.

00:36:13.016 --> 00:36:15.970
So you may be 50,000 pounds
that you get as fixed.

00:36:15.970 --> 00:36:19.390
If you play 20 games for
us and appear in 20 games,

00:36:19.390 --> 00:36:21.760
you will then go up to
60,000 pounds a week

00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:25.510
and then 70,000 pounds a week
if you get to 40, 60, 80.

00:36:25.510 --> 00:36:28.883
And again, that's very important
for how you define appearance.

00:36:28.883 --> 00:36:30.800
I've talked about
appearance for way too long.

00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:32.633
But hopefully, you can
see why that actually

00:36:32.633 --> 00:36:36.190
becomes quite an important
element for players and agents

00:36:36.190 --> 00:36:41.010
and clubs to understand.

00:36:41.010 --> 00:36:44.260
Last bit about dispelling
myths a little bit as well--

00:36:44.260 --> 00:36:46.920
so I've just put the
phrase out there,

00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:50.910
which is, image rights deals are
just another way to avoid tax.

00:36:50.910 --> 00:36:52.810
I just want to briefly spend--

00:36:52.810 --> 00:36:55.330
are we OK for time?--

00:36:55.330 --> 00:36:57.330
a few minutes talking
about what an image rights

00:36:57.330 --> 00:36:59.430
deal is for players
and then talking

00:36:59.430 --> 00:37:05.280
about why it's important
in the current environment.

00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:09.920
So if I just try and
explain very briefly--

00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:11.930
traditionally, a
player will only

00:37:11.930 --> 00:37:14.840
have one contract with his club.

00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:18.080
It will be an employment
contract that will say,

00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:20.120
you are employed by this
club to play football.

00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:22.220
It's straightforward,
with all of those clauses

00:37:22.220 --> 00:37:25.250
and all the things we
talked about previously.

00:37:25.250 --> 00:37:30.240
Nowadays, for a lot of the elite
clubs, for their elite players,

00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:32.690
they have a huge raft of
partners and partnership

00:37:32.690 --> 00:37:34.670
agreements and endorsement
deals that they

00:37:34.670 --> 00:37:36.890
can activate across
the globe, which

00:37:36.890 --> 00:37:39.830
are very lucrative contracts.

00:37:39.830 --> 00:37:43.510
And what clubs are realizing
is, they are happy to--

00:37:43.510 --> 00:37:44.750
well, not realizing.

00:37:44.750 --> 00:37:48.470
What they want to do is control
the activities of their players

00:37:48.470 --> 00:37:52.910
to a degree, so that they
can activate those players

00:37:52.910 --> 00:37:57.410
for the club to be able to then
activate its own partnership

00:37:57.410 --> 00:38:00.600
arrangements over
a long-term basis.

00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:05.030
So do Spurs want Harry Kane
to be able to activate a Nike

00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:06.320
campaign for the Spurs?

00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:07.580
Yes, they do.

00:38:07.580 --> 00:38:11.570
Do Liverpool want Mo Salah
to be able to activate

00:38:11.570 --> 00:38:15.350
a particular campaign
for Standard Chartered?

00:38:15.350 --> 00:38:16.760
Obviously, they do.

00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:18.560
Within the standard
contract, there

00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:20.660
are default positions
where players

00:38:20.660 --> 00:38:23.840
have to have x amount
of appearances.

00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:26.540
But what is happening more
and more with elite clubs

00:38:26.540 --> 00:38:29.420
is they are entering now
into two separate deals

00:38:29.420 --> 00:38:30.680
with their players.

00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:33.120
One is the employment contract.

00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:35.810
But the second is the image
rights contract-- usually,

00:38:35.810 --> 00:38:39.070
with a player's company.

00:38:39.070 --> 00:38:41.690
And what happens in this
deal is the player's company,

00:38:41.690 --> 00:38:44.150
more or less, promises
to do two things, which

00:38:44.150 --> 00:38:47.300
is of real significant
value to the club.

00:38:47.300 --> 00:38:53.630
One is, it says, for the
provision of x amount of money,

00:38:53.630 --> 00:38:57.550
we, the club, want to make sure
that you, the player's image

00:38:57.550 --> 00:39:01.990
rights company, make sure that
the player appears in x amount

00:39:01.990 --> 00:39:06.670
of endorsement opportunities
and partnership opportunities

00:39:06.670 --> 00:39:09.042
for the club's partners.

00:39:09.042 --> 00:39:11.433
Does that make sense?

00:39:11.433 --> 00:39:12.850
Guaranteed numbers--
so that means

00:39:12.850 --> 00:39:14.392
that then the club's
commercial teams

00:39:14.392 --> 00:39:18.160
can go out and sell
quite a lot of inventory,

00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:21.640
on the basis of knowing that,
maybe, their top 15 stars

00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:23.770
will be available
and are contractually

00:39:23.770 --> 00:39:29.610
available to help endorse
the club in a club context.

00:39:29.610 --> 00:39:31.920
And that's a very
important element.

00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:35.910
The other element, which is very
useful to the club in paying

00:39:35.910 --> 00:39:39.560
a player's image
rights company, is

00:39:39.560 --> 00:39:43.490
that there are hell of a lot of
restrictions that then the club

00:39:43.490 --> 00:39:46.748
can impose on the player.

00:39:46.748 --> 00:39:48.290
So just to give you
a brief example--

00:39:48.290 --> 00:39:51.380
so I don't know how many
partners Manchester United

00:39:51.380 --> 00:39:53.180
have throughout the world--

00:39:53.180 --> 00:39:54.020
global partners.

00:39:54.020 --> 00:39:55.410
AUDIENCE: It's 150?

00:39:55.410 --> 00:39:56.770
DANIEL GEEY: There's a lot.

00:39:56.770 --> 00:39:58.100
I'm not sure it's quite 150.

00:39:58.100 --> 00:40:02.010
At last count, I think
there was upwards of 90.

00:40:02.010 --> 00:40:05.570
So for example-- and just, by
way of-- if it's Manchester

00:40:05.570 --> 00:40:08.330
United, if it's Chelsea, if it's
Liverpool, if it's Arsenal--

00:40:08.330 --> 00:40:14.170
a lot of these clubs have a big
roster of commercial partners.

00:40:14.170 --> 00:40:17.270
And what those clubs would
ideally want from their players

00:40:17.270 --> 00:40:21.590
is to ensure that those
players cannot contract with

00:40:21.590 --> 00:40:27.580
a competitor of the club brands.

00:40:27.580 --> 00:40:29.200
Which means that
they are effectively

00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:34.665
clean from any club competitors,
which then puts them

00:40:34.665 --> 00:40:36.040
in a strong position
to make sure

00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:40.420
that their players are never
going to endorse competitors

00:40:40.420 --> 00:40:42.550
of the club's brands.

00:40:42.550 --> 00:40:44.110
And that's quite a
valuable commodity

00:40:44.110 --> 00:40:48.410
to be able to
actually use as well.

00:40:48.410 --> 00:40:51.500
The flip side, which is why
we talked about tax, is--

00:40:51.500 --> 00:40:55.220
the reason I've said all of
that commercial explanation--

00:40:55.220 --> 00:40:56.990
is because, still,
there are always

00:40:56.990 --> 00:41:00.980
big headlines about the fact
that image rights deals are

00:41:00.980 --> 00:41:02.690
just a way to avoid tax.

00:41:02.690 --> 00:41:05.660
Because obviously, player's
image rights companies are

00:41:05.660 --> 00:41:08.810
paying corporation tax
rather than pay-as-you-go,

00:41:08.810 --> 00:41:12.350
pay-as-you-earn, and National
Insurance Contributions.

00:41:12.350 --> 00:41:15.530
The point being is that, even
though that money is coming in,

00:41:15.530 --> 00:41:18.800
and the player's image
rights company is only

00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:22.640
paying corporation tax,
that money is still

00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:24.330
in that club's accounts.

00:41:24.330 --> 00:41:26.597
If the player wants
to remove that money,

00:41:26.597 --> 00:41:28.430
he's either got to pay
it through dividends,

00:41:28.430 --> 00:41:31.105
he's got to pay it through
salary to other people

00:41:31.105 --> 00:41:31.980
through the company--

00:41:31.980 --> 00:41:33.200
however it is.

00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:37.490
There still needs to be tax
paid for onshore companies that

00:41:37.490 --> 00:41:39.950
are using an image
rights structure.

00:41:39.950 --> 00:41:43.250
So my point is, I'm not the
guy that will always say,

00:41:43.250 --> 00:41:45.890
image rights structures are
always totally inadequate.

00:41:45.890 --> 00:41:48.290
It's just another
way to avoid tax.

00:41:48.290 --> 00:41:50.150
Usually, there are
very good reasons

00:41:50.150 --> 00:41:54.110
why clubs will want to enter
into image rights agreements

00:41:54.110 --> 00:41:55.640
with their players.

00:41:55.640 --> 00:41:58.190
One-- because it guarantees
them appearances.

00:41:58.190 --> 00:42:01.760
And two-- it means they
can restrict the players

00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:05.300
in promoting competitor
club brands, which

00:42:05.300 --> 00:42:07.690
can be very important.

00:42:07.690 --> 00:42:09.320
OK-- almost there.

00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:12.070
I promise.

00:42:12.070 --> 00:42:13.120
What's next?

00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:14.440
I just wanted to talk--

00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:16.360
we talked, actually,
about agents already.

00:42:16.360 --> 00:42:18.490
And get your questions
ready, if you

00:42:18.490 --> 00:42:20.180
have any questions, as we go.

00:42:20.180 --> 00:42:22.360
I'm more than happy
to answer anything.

00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:25.198
But a lot of people actually,
since I've released the book,

00:42:25.198 --> 00:42:26.740
have actually said,
well, what do you

00:42:26.740 --> 00:42:29.027
think is next for the industry?

00:42:29.027 --> 00:42:31.360
And there's a chapter right
at the beginning of the book

00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:33.435
called, "The
football ecosystem,"

00:42:33.435 --> 00:42:34.810
where I talk about
how everything

00:42:34.810 --> 00:42:36.070
is overlaid together.

00:42:36.070 --> 00:42:39.407
So where do players fit
in with their clubs?

00:42:39.407 --> 00:42:40.990
Where do clubs fit
in with the league?

00:42:40.990 --> 00:42:43.120
Where do the leagues fit
in with broadcasters?

00:42:43.120 --> 00:42:44.590
Where do broadcasters
fit in with the fans

00:42:44.590 --> 00:42:45.340
for subscriptions?

00:42:45.340 --> 00:42:47.327
Where are our
international games?

00:42:47.327 --> 00:42:49.660
What about FIFA and UEFA and
all of these different ways

00:42:49.660 --> 00:42:52.840
that the football world works?

00:42:52.840 --> 00:42:55.480
And people have said to
me for quite some time--

00:42:55.480 --> 00:42:57.280
and continue to ask me--

00:42:57.280 --> 00:42:59.675
is the football
model sustainable?

00:42:59.675 --> 00:43:02.050
I think that's one of the
things that lots of people say.

00:43:02.050 --> 00:43:04.600
Football players are
being paid huge amounts

00:43:04.600 --> 00:43:06.700
of sums to be able
to play football

00:43:06.700 --> 00:43:09.460
and for their image
to be able to be used.

00:43:09.460 --> 00:43:11.900
Is that model sustainable
in the longer term?

00:43:11.900 --> 00:43:14.200
Where we have Sky,
for example, and BT

00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:20.170
paying over 5 billion
pounds for UK rights

00:43:20.170 --> 00:43:25.180
and a whole raft of broadcasters
paying upwards of 4 billion

00:43:25.180 --> 00:43:28.600
for the overseas rights for
live Premier League matches.

00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:30.820
The query is, well,
how can clubs still

00:43:30.820 --> 00:43:32.770
afford to pay all of
these wages and pay

00:43:32.770 --> 00:43:34.350
these exorbitant transfer fees?

00:43:34.350 --> 00:43:36.850
Is the bottom going to come out
of the market at some point?

00:43:36.850 --> 00:43:39.533
That's the type of question
I get asked quite a lot.

00:43:39.533 --> 00:43:41.450
And the answer-- at least
for the time being--

00:43:41.450 --> 00:43:43.950
and that's why I just put the
broadcasting points up there--

00:43:43.950 --> 00:43:48.640
is that, so long as there is
an appetite for broadcasters

00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:51.430
to spend large sums of money--

00:43:51.430 --> 00:43:53.260
because they think
they can recoup

00:43:53.260 --> 00:43:55.150
that money by way
of subscriptions

00:43:55.150 --> 00:43:56.430
and different models--

00:43:56.430 --> 00:43:59.380
then at the moment,
the answer is yes.

00:43:59.380 --> 00:44:02.890
But I saw some interesting
stats a few weeks ago explaining

00:44:02.890 --> 00:44:07.990
that Sky, in the purchasing
of the rights for Premier

00:44:07.990 --> 00:44:10.120
League matches,
seem to be straining

00:44:10.120 --> 00:44:12.730
a little bit in removing
some of their other content,

00:44:12.730 --> 00:44:15.910
because they've had to spend
so much money on Premier League

00:44:15.910 --> 00:44:18.760
matches and live
Premier League matches.

00:44:18.760 --> 00:44:21.520
And in the same way,
whilst Sky has always

00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:24.910
been the incumbent for live
Premier League matches,

00:44:24.910 --> 00:44:27.400
BT came into the market
two auctions ago,

00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:32.030
effectively, because they
saw quite significant churn.

00:44:32.030 --> 00:44:35.770
They saw churn away from
their broadband offering

00:44:35.770 --> 00:44:40.420
into Sky broadband,
because people were already

00:44:40.420 --> 00:44:44.920
taking Pay TV Sky
Sports and thought

00:44:44.920 --> 00:44:48.520
that they should bundle Sky
broadband with their Sky Sports

00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:49.640
offering.

00:44:49.640 --> 00:44:52.720
So in some ways-- what a lot of
commentators said at the time

00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:55.120
was that BT came into
the market to protect

00:44:55.120 --> 00:44:57.477
their broadband
offering and then

00:44:57.477 --> 00:44:59.560
in order to be able to get
Champions League rights

00:44:59.560 --> 00:45:00.880
and Premier League rights.

00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:03.580
And then you can see what's
happened subsequently.

00:45:03.580 --> 00:45:05.480
BT by EE.

00:45:05.480 --> 00:45:08.980
Sky have their own
mobile offering as well.

00:45:08.980 --> 00:45:10.980
And you have what's called
a quad play offering.

00:45:10.980 --> 00:45:13.450
So you have two
quad play players

00:45:13.450 --> 00:45:17.420
playing out in the UK market,
for a whole range of consumer

00:45:17.420 --> 00:45:17.920
goods.

00:45:20.930 --> 00:45:23.950
Pay TV and the Premier
League being a very big part

00:45:23.950 --> 00:45:26.330
of that overall picture.

00:45:26.330 --> 00:45:29.003
So the question
is, at some point--

00:45:29.003 --> 00:45:30.170
who knows what will happen--

00:45:30.170 --> 00:45:32.450
is whether subscriptions
start dropping off,

00:45:32.450 --> 00:45:34.340
because of the
cord-cutting generation--

00:45:34.340 --> 00:45:36.530
because people aren't
willing to pay 60,

00:45:36.530 --> 00:45:42.260
70 pounds a month for their Sky
or BT pay TV subscriptions--

00:45:42.260 --> 00:45:43.850
the question asked a week ago--

00:45:43.850 --> 00:45:47.323
Simon Jordan was
on "Talk Sport."

00:45:47.323 --> 00:45:49.490
And he said, why don't the
Premier League just go it

00:45:49.490 --> 00:45:50.430
alone?

00:45:50.430 --> 00:45:52.220
Why don't they just
go straight to market

00:45:52.220 --> 00:45:55.050
and offer an OTT
offering globally

00:45:55.050 --> 00:45:57.980
and ask people to
pay 8 to 10 pounds

00:45:57.980 --> 00:46:00.500
a month to watch every
Premier League match they want

00:46:00.500 --> 00:46:02.690
and take away the broadcasters?

00:46:02.690 --> 00:46:09.770
I wrote a blog 10 years
ago about that exact point.

00:46:09.770 --> 00:46:12.790
Major League Baseball do it
really well in the States.

00:46:12.790 --> 00:46:14.690
And there's a real
interesting offering now

00:46:14.690 --> 00:46:17.330
that could possibly
come to fruition.

00:46:17.330 --> 00:46:19.670
But the truth is, it
would take a very brave--

00:46:19.670 --> 00:46:21.920
whoever the next chief
executive of the Premier League

00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:27.650
to come in and decide not to
take the 9 billion pounds check

00:46:27.650 --> 00:46:30.740
that is usually on the table
for the global distribution

00:46:30.740 --> 00:46:32.660
of its rights.

00:46:32.660 --> 00:46:35.930
So if I just end on that note,
which is, are things changing?

00:46:35.930 --> 00:46:38.180
There's cool things happening
in the market right now.

00:46:38.180 --> 00:46:40.555
There's lots of different
broadcasters doing cool things.

00:46:40.555 --> 00:46:43.640
But ultimately, so long
as that money funnel

00:46:43.640 --> 00:46:48.110
continues, because fans and
subscribers are subscribing

00:46:48.110 --> 00:46:50.690
to those channels, then
that money flow will

00:46:50.690 --> 00:46:51.980
continue throughout the game.

00:46:51.980 --> 00:46:54.710
And players will probably
paid significant amounts,

00:46:54.710 --> 00:46:58.070
because they are that good
and because the clubs can

00:46:58.070 --> 00:46:59.160
afford it.

00:46:59.160 --> 00:47:02.030
So on that note, I
think I'll probably say,

00:47:02.030 --> 00:47:03.410
thank you for listening.

00:47:03.410 --> 00:47:05.284
And-- happy to
answer any questions.

00:47:05.284 --> 00:47:07.140
[APPLAUSE]

00:47:10.860 --> 00:47:13.290
AUDIENCE: Great talk-- what's
the strangest thing that

00:47:13.290 --> 00:47:15.870
you've seen in a player's
employment contracts with

00:47:15.870 --> 00:47:17.000
a club?--

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:18.450
like a clause or some sort.

00:47:23.010 --> 00:47:26.188
DANIEL GEEY: I haven't seen any,
like, totally bizarre things

00:47:26.188 --> 00:47:27.480
that I'm thinking, oh, my gosh.

00:47:27.480 --> 00:47:30.570
That's just really weird.

00:47:30.570 --> 00:47:33.150
But there's lots of publicized
ones that I've put in the book

00:47:33.150 --> 00:47:33.650
really.

00:47:33.650 --> 00:47:36.830
So if I talk about
a few of them--

00:47:36.830 --> 00:47:40.380
and this is just what's been
reported in the press really.

00:47:40.380 --> 00:47:42.780
So Neil Ruddock, who was an
ex-Liverpool player and Spurs

00:47:42.780 --> 00:47:46.310
player back in the
day-- who I think

00:47:46.310 --> 00:47:48.060
could have only really
played center back,

00:47:48.060 --> 00:47:49.665
because he was quite a big guy.

00:47:49.665 --> 00:47:51.290
But he scored a great
goal, I remember,

00:47:51.290 --> 00:47:53.460
in the Monday night
Liverpool-Man U game.

00:47:53.460 --> 00:47:56.160
When he went, towards
the end of his career,

00:47:56.160 --> 00:47:58.680
to a particular
club, the report was

00:47:58.680 --> 00:48:03.450
that they put a weight
clause in his contract,

00:48:03.450 --> 00:48:06.240
so that if he went
over a certain weight,

00:48:06.240 --> 00:48:08.040
he would be fined
or his wages would

00:48:08.040 --> 00:48:10.840
be reduced by a certain limit.

00:48:10.840 --> 00:48:12.630
Another clause,
which I read about,

00:48:12.630 --> 00:48:14.520
which was Stefan Schwarz--

00:48:14.520 --> 00:48:16.920
he was a Swedish
international player.

00:48:16.920 --> 00:48:17.880
He moved to Sunderland.

00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:20.300
And apparently, there
was a clause which said--

00:48:20.300 --> 00:48:22.050
Sunderland had read
somewhere that one

00:48:22.050 --> 00:48:25.080
of the things he always
wanted to do was go to space.

00:48:25.080 --> 00:48:26.790
So Sunderland
apparently put a clause

00:48:26.790 --> 00:48:29.940
in saying, during
your time at our club,

00:48:29.940 --> 00:48:33.870
you are prohibited
from going into space.

00:48:33.870 --> 00:48:36.578
And there was another one which
is from a Liverpool player--

00:48:36.578 --> 00:48:37.370
next level player--

00:48:37.370 --> 00:48:41.660
Stig Inge Bjornebye, who was
a Norwegian international.

00:48:41.660 --> 00:48:44.340
His father was, I
think, an Olympic skier.

00:48:44.340 --> 00:48:46.290
And Liverpool ensured
that there was

00:48:46.290 --> 00:48:48.600
a clause in which said he
couldn't ski during the time

00:48:48.600 --> 00:48:52.020
that he was a Liverpool player,
for obvious reasons really.

00:48:52.020 --> 00:48:53.650
And that is quite
a standard clause,

00:48:53.650 --> 00:48:56.025
that you can't do anything
hazardous, for obvious reasons

00:48:56.025 --> 00:48:57.773
that you would
probably hurt yourself.

00:48:57.773 --> 00:48:59.940
AUDIENCE: Just a quick
question about the boot stuff

00:48:59.940 --> 00:49:00.982
that you put up as well--

00:49:00.982 --> 00:49:02.440
I've got a good
friend actually who

00:49:02.440 --> 00:49:03.790
works for one of the big two.

00:49:03.790 --> 00:49:07.945
And he was saying-- about one of
the biggest challenges he cites

00:49:07.945 --> 00:49:09.570
with working with
some of the players--

00:49:09.570 --> 00:49:12.630
he looks after five Premier
League clubs, I think--

00:49:12.630 --> 00:49:14.790
is their egos and
their personalities.

00:49:14.790 --> 00:49:16.890
And they all want
things for free,

00:49:16.890 --> 00:49:19.440
even though they
earn mega money.

00:49:19.440 --> 00:49:23.220
So I suppose, my question
is around expectations.

00:49:23.220 --> 00:49:25.820
How do you deal with
expectations with players

00:49:25.820 --> 00:49:27.610
and with big egos?

00:49:27.610 --> 00:49:29.840
Well, not everyone's
got big egos--

00:49:29.840 --> 00:49:31.430
and brushing everybody.

00:49:31.430 --> 00:49:34.520
But yeah-- how do you deal
with those expectations

00:49:34.520 --> 00:49:37.170
of players and big players?

00:49:37.170 --> 00:49:38.790
DANIEL GEEY: Are
you talking about--

00:49:38.790 --> 00:49:40.240
in terms of boot deals?--
or just generally?

00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:41.670
AUDIENCE: Just generally-- yeah.

00:49:41.670 --> 00:49:43.580
I suppose, it's quite
difficult to manage--

00:49:43.580 --> 00:49:45.180
yeah.

00:49:45.180 --> 00:49:47.580
DANIEL GEEY: Simple
truth is that,

00:49:47.580 --> 00:49:50.580
of the players that I have
close relationships with--

00:49:50.580 --> 00:49:52.470
and literally, it's hilarious.

00:49:52.470 --> 00:49:52.970
I'm cool.

00:49:52.970 --> 00:49:55.470
As a football fan, they'll just
WhatsApp you and say, hello.

00:49:55.470 --> 00:49:57.480
And literally, I'm giving
book recommendations

00:49:57.480 --> 00:50:02.850
to one player, who's
interested in just expanding

00:50:02.850 --> 00:50:04.987
his repertoire of
reading at the moment,

00:50:04.987 --> 00:50:06.570
because they have
loads of away trips.

00:50:06.570 --> 00:50:09.780
And he's got lots of
time on his hands.

00:50:09.780 --> 00:50:13.898
But the majority of
players that I end up

00:50:13.898 --> 00:50:15.690
having good relationships
with are the guys

00:50:15.690 --> 00:50:17.760
that want to know the detail--

00:50:17.760 --> 00:50:18.930
is the truth.

00:50:18.930 --> 00:50:21.642
And usually, in my
experience, the players

00:50:21.642 --> 00:50:23.850
that want to know the detail
are the most switched on

00:50:23.850 --> 00:50:27.210
to understand the
way things work.

00:50:27.210 --> 00:50:29.370
The players that maybe
don't are the ones

00:50:29.370 --> 00:50:31.148
that I'll be like,
just leave it.

00:50:31.148 --> 00:50:32.190
And let the lawyer do it.

00:50:32.190 --> 00:50:33.210
Let the accountant do it.

00:50:33.210 --> 00:50:34.710
Let the agent do
it-- however it is.

00:50:34.710 --> 00:50:36.030
That's absolutely fine too.

00:50:36.030 --> 00:50:39.317
But usually-- I don't like
to call it prima dona status

00:50:39.317 --> 00:50:41.900
actually, because maybe they're
not as educated as they need--

00:50:41.900 --> 00:50:45.720
as the team around them need
to give them to make sure they

00:50:45.720 --> 00:50:49.350
understand what they need to be
doing on a daily basis to get

00:50:49.350 --> 00:50:49.950
by--

00:50:49.950 --> 00:50:51.122
is the truth.

00:50:51.122 --> 00:50:52.830
And what I try and do
a lot of the time--

00:50:52.830 --> 00:50:54.663
just to flip it onto
the positive-- is that,

00:50:54.663 --> 00:50:55.880
every time a new player--

00:50:55.880 --> 00:50:57.630
even if it's a young
player-- especially--

00:50:57.630 --> 00:50:59.172
comes into the office
to say, hello--

00:50:59.172 --> 00:51:00.570
or helping them with the deal--

00:51:00.570 --> 00:51:01.537
my idea is, like, look.

00:51:01.537 --> 00:51:03.870
Just give me 1/2 an hour with
the agents and the player.

00:51:03.870 --> 00:51:06.015
I just want to talk you
through particular things

00:51:06.015 --> 00:51:08.390
that I think are going to be
important for the next deal,

00:51:08.390 --> 00:51:10.745
for the next endorsement
deal you're signing.

00:51:10.745 --> 00:51:12.870
Think about what you're
doing on Twitter, or Insta,

00:51:12.870 --> 00:51:16.410
or Snap or Tinder--

00:51:16.410 --> 00:51:17.010
literally.

00:51:17.010 --> 00:51:20.880
Because everybody has a phone.

00:51:20.880 --> 00:51:22.890
Everybody has a video.

00:51:22.890 --> 00:51:26.160
Everybody wants to catch
someone out doing something

00:51:26.160 --> 00:51:27.808
they shouldn't do who's famous.

00:51:27.808 --> 00:51:29.600
That's the truth,
unfortunately, that we're

00:51:29.600 --> 00:51:30.900
living in at the moment.

00:51:30.900 --> 00:51:33.450
Players 20 years ago were
in, in a way, a much more

00:51:33.450 --> 00:51:34.410
privileged position.

00:51:34.410 --> 00:51:36.493
They could probably get
away with a lot more stuff

00:51:36.493 --> 00:51:37.930
that players can't do now.

00:51:37.930 --> 00:51:39.740
So that's almost
the point, which is,

00:51:39.740 --> 00:51:42.060
I'm trying just
to flip and pivot

00:51:42.060 --> 00:51:45.075
the narrative, which is,
get players better educated

00:51:45.075 --> 00:51:46.450
as to what they
need to be doing,

00:51:46.450 --> 00:51:48.328
so they can make more
informed decisions.

00:51:48.328 --> 00:51:49.870
Always, players will
do things wrong.

00:51:49.870 --> 00:51:53.620
They're as fallible as us.

00:51:53.620 --> 00:51:55.620
I think people just like
a bit of schadenfreude,

00:51:55.620 --> 00:51:57.703
where a famous person who's
earning a lot of money

00:51:57.703 --> 00:52:00.510
does something stupid.

00:52:00.510 --> 00:52:02.820
AUDIENCE: Just
wondering how you manage

00:52:02.820 --> 00:52:07.320
your clients' expectations when
you're dealing with someone

00:52:07.320 --> 00:52:10.740
who-- so for example, a
player that is injury prone--

00:52:10.740 --> 00:52:13.830
and you're going to see that
in their boot sponsorship deals

00:52:13.830 --> 00:52:15.480
and in their appearances.

00:52:15.480 --> 00:52:19.292
A lot of that is tied to
their appearances and--

00:52:19.292 --> 00:52:20.250
how you deal with that.

00:52:23.100 --> 00:52:26.160
DANIEL GEEY: It's
a really good one.

00:52:26.160 --> 00:52:29.370
It depends how you classify
injury-prone-- is the truth.

00:52:29.370 --> 00:52:31.140
Now, either you do
one of two things.

00:52:31.140 --> 00:52:34.320
As an agent, you can strategize
beforehand to say, right.

00:52:34.320 --> 00:52:37.590
We've got three boot deal
offerings on the table.

00:52:37.590 --> 00:52:41.010
The retainer amount
is this amount

00:52:41.010 --> 00:52:42.840
for this particular
manufacturer.

00:52:42.840 --> 00:52:45.060
We think an estimate that--
because over last three

00:52:45.060 --> 00:52:48.090
seasons, the players
played 25 games per season,

00:52:48.090 --> 00:52:51.330
because either injuries
or form-- whatever it is.

00:52:51.330 --> 00:52:54.270
We need to try and get to
this number with this amount

00:52:54.270 --> 00:52:56.520
of appearances that we think
we can get for the player

00:52:56.520 --> 00:52:57.820
every season.

00:52:57.820 --> 00:52:59.910
So in a way, it's a
reverse engineering

00:52:59.910 --> 00:53:03.600
of the contractual
matrix, in order

00:53:03.600 --> 00:53:07.260
to make sure that you can
get the player over the line,

00:53:07.260 --> 00:53:09.213
saying, this is the
amount that you may earn.

00:53:09.213 --> 00:53:11.130
But you're probably going
to earn this amount,

00:53:11.130 --> 00:53:13.297
because of the amount of
games you're going to play.

00:53:13.297 --> 00:53:15.390
And ultimately, what
can sometimes happen--

00:53:15.390 --> 00:53:17.740
which can help-- is on
the appearance side,

00:53:17.740 --> 00:53:19.360
which I didn't quite touch on.

00:53:19.360 --> 00:53:21.270
If you're savvy enough,
what you can actually

00:53:21.270 --> 00:53:24.000
say to the boot
manufacturer is, we're

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:25.620
only going to
classify appearance

00:53:25.620 --> 00:53:28.950
as particular competitions.

00:53:28.950 --> 00:53:30.630
Because if you're
an elite athlete--

00:53:30.630 --> 00:53:33.570
elite footballer--
you're probably

00:53:33.570 --> 00:53:36.580
less likely to play in
FA Cup and League Cup

00:53:36.580 --> 00:53:39.240
and more likely to play in
Champions League and Premier

00:53:39.240 --> 00:53:40.230
League.

00:53:40.230 --> 00:53:45.840
So what you would try and do,
if you're the agent acting

00:53:45.840 --> 00:53:46.890
for elite player--

00:53:46.890 --> 00:53:52.710
you'd try and exclude the cup
competitions to try and ensure

00:53:52.710 --> 00:53:56.513
that, if appearance is
defined as 80% of those games,

00:53:56.513 --> 00:53:58.680
you're more likely to about
to hit those benchmarks.

00:53:58.680 --> 00:54:01.430
