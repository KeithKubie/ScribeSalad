00:00:01.367 --> 00:00:04.604
HAVE TO DO A LITTLE ASS
COVERING.

00:00:04.637 --> 00:00:06.205
SO LET'S POP THIS UP.

00:00:06.238 --> 00:00:07.039
OKAY?

00:00:07.072 --> 00:00:08.107
( LAUGHTER )
JUST COVERING MY ASS.

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:09.142
COVERING MY ASS.

00:00:09.175 --> 00:00:10.610
AND LEASE-- YOU KNOW WHAT?

00:00:10.643 --> 00:00:14.714
LET'S HAVE SOMEONE FROM COMEDY
CENTRAL LEGAL COME OUT AND STAND

00:00:14.747 --> 00:00:17.550
OVER MY SHOULDER, IF YOU COULD,
COMEDY CENTRAL THERE.

00:00:17.583 --> 00:00:18.951
THANK YOU.

00:00:18.984 --> 00:00:21.320
( LAUGHTER )
( APPLAUSE )

00:00:21.353 --> 00:00:22.822
YOU KNOW WHAT WE OUGHT TO DO?

00:00:22.855 --> 00:00:26.426
THIS IS KIND OF DANGEROUS, SO WE
SHOULD FLASH THE TERMS AND

00:00:26.459 --> 00:00:28.394
CONDITIONS OF THIS BIT BEFORE WE
START.

00:00:28.427 --> 00:00:30.029
GOOD.

00:00:30.062 --> 00:00:30.396
GOOD.

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:30.930
IT'S TRUE.

00:00:30.963 --> 00:00:32.465
IT'S TRUE.

00:00:32.498 --> 00:00:36.669
I REALLY-- THAT LAST ONE I
REALLY BELIEVE THAT LAST

00:00:36.702 --> 00:00:37.036
PARAGRAPH.

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:38.071
OK GREAT.

00:00:38.104 --> 00:00:40.640
RESUME COMEDY BIT.

00:00:40.673 --> 00:00:45.678
NOW, LOOK, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT
YOU GUYS, BUT I GOT SOME MESSAGE

00:00:45.711 --> 00:00:49.082
FROM BALTIMORE LOUD AND CLEAR. 
ONLY WAY WE HAVE A CHANCE OF

00:00:49.115 --> 00:00:53.753
GETTING COPS CHARGED IN TAMIR
RICE'S BORDER IS A CLONE ARMY OF

00:00:53.786 --> 00:00:58.124
MARILYN MOSBYS ALL OVER THE
COUNTRY.

00:00:58.157 --> 00:00:59.425
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
I'M JUST SAYING, THIS FAMILY

00:00:59.458 --> 00:01:01.794
NEEDS JUSTICE, AND THE
AUTHORITIES WILL DO EVERYTHING

00:01:01.827 --> 00:01:11.070
THEY CAN TO COVER UP THEIR OWN
LIKE-- I'M SURE THE AUTHORITIES

00:01:11.103 --> 00:01:13.406
ARE DOING EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO
BRING ABOUT A RESOLUTION.

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.275
( LAUGHTER )
BUT IT MIGHT BE TIME TO REMIND

00:01:16.308 --> 00:01:21.714
THEM THAT THEY'VE HAD PLENTY OF
TIME TO BRING CHARGES, OKAY.

00:01:21.747 --> 00:01:24.784
THE THING WE HAVE TO KEEP
HAMMERING HOME, YOU GUYS, IS NO

00:01:24.817 --> 00:01:26.018
JUSTICE, NO PEACE.

00:01:26.052 --> 00:01:29.689
I'M NOT NECESSARILY SAYING--
LOOK, LET ME PUT IT LIKE THIS.

00:01:29.722 --> 00:01:33.326
IF WE WANT TO GET JUSTICE HERE,
WE HAVE TO GET LOUD-- WHAT,

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:34.026
WHAT, WHAT?

00:01:34.059 --> 00:01:35.294
, OF COURSE.

00:01:35.327 --> 00:01:39.365
JUSTICE AND PEACE, OF COURSE,
THEY'RE NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE.

00:01:39.398 --> 00:01:46.139
( LAUGHTER )
THE ONLY WAY ANYONE LISTENS IS

00:01:46.172 --> 00:01:50.409
IF THE FIGHT SPILLS OUT INTO THE
STREETS Y'ALL, YOU BE WHAT I'M.

00:01:50.442 --> 00:01:52.945
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
WHAT?

00:01:52.978 --> 00:01:59.318
OR, OR, OR IF YOU'D RATHER, FEEL
FREE TO PROTEST INSIDE YOUR

00:01:59.351 --> 00:02:00.019
HOME.

00:02:00.052 --> 00:02:03.789
( LAUGHTER )
START A HASHTAG?

00:02:03.822 --> 00:02:07.660
SEND A STRONGLY WORDED E-MAIL TO
YOUR LOCAL REPRESENTATIVE.

00:02:07.693 --> 00:02:10.196
VIOLENCE IS NEVER THE ANSWER.

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.130
OKAY.

00:02:11.164 --> 00:02:13.032
( LAUGHTER )
BUT PEOPLE NEED TO GET THER

00:02:13.065 --> 00:02:14.166
VOICES HEARD SOMEHOW.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.603
AND, LOOK, MAYBE SOMETIMES THAT
TAKES THE FORM OF ANGER.

00:02:17.636 --> 00:02:22.008
AND YOU KNOW, WHEN THAT ANGER--
WHAT!

00:02:22.041 --> 00:02:23.976
OKAY, HOW'S THIS?

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:27.713
THAT FAMILY NEEDS JUSTICE AND WE
CANNOT LET THAT STORY FADE AWAY.

00:02:27.746 --> 00:02:28.948
IS THAT OKAY?

00:02:28.981 --> 00:02:30.016
IS THAT OKAY?

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:34.720
ALL RIGHT LET ME PUT IT LIKE
THIS.

00:02:34.753 --> 00:02:37.723
MARILYN MOSBY MAY HAVE BROUGHT
CHARGES AGAINST THOSE COPS IN

00:02:37.756 --> 00:02:38.590
BALTIMORE.

00:02:38.624 --> 00:02:41.060
SOME SAY SHE MAY HAVE ACTED TOO
SWIFTLY.

00:02:41.093 --> 00:02:44.096
THE DETAILS ARE STILL COMING OUT
AS OF THIS MOMENT BUT IT

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:47.099
DIDN'T SEEM LIKE ANYTHING
HAPPENED UNTIL PEOPLE GOT OUT ON

00:02:47.132 --> 00:02:48.200
THE STREETS.

00:02:48.233 --> 00:02:50.102
IT SHOULD NOT BE THIS WAY BUT
IT'S NOT SURPRISING.

00:02:50.135 --> 00:02:52.471
THE MESSAGE WE'RE STILL GETTING
IS NOBODY PAYS ATTENTION UNTIL

00:02:52.504 --> 00:02:54.040
YOU GET A LITTLE ANGRY.

00:02:54.073 --> 00:02:57.873
WELL, I'M ANGRY AS HELL ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED TO TAMIR RICE.
