I did want to mention something very specific, here.

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:06.990
You should always wrap label elements around your input elements,

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.980
and their associated labeling texts, because it increases the touchable

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.760
area of the control. The only difference between these two

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.250
controls is that one of them has a label

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.480
element around it. But you'll notice, it's much easier to

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.930
touch the one with the label. The one without a

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:26.380
label, you have to actually touch the check box itself,

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.020
in order to activate the control.
