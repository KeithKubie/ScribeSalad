00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.560
You know how a group of crows is called a
murder?

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:08.580
Turns out that murder can be pretty scary.

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.349
Hey guys Julia here for DNews

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:15.820
so we know how crazy smart animals like dolphins,
pigs, chimps and octopuses, octopi are…

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:16.820
right?

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.220
Oh god I might have to talk about cephalopods
in a future episode, god they’re cool.

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.699
Anyway, have you thought about that murder
of crows sitting outside your house?

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.869
Yeah those guys are crazy smart.

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:29.600
Scientists used to think that one of things
that separated humans from animals was the

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.180
making of and use of tools, like spears and
stuff.

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.220
But that all changed when researchers like
Jane Goodall realized that chimps use sticks

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.240
as tools to get ants out of logs.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.540
Suddenly humans didn’t look so smart anymore.

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.472
Scientists consider the corvid family, which
includes crows, magpies, and ravens, some

00:00:44.472 --> 00:00:46.040
of the smartest among birds.

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.600
I guess big things come in small packages.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.310
Despite that tiny brain span, crows are no
bird brains.

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:56.180
One of the most famous examples of crow intelligence
is the way they make hooks to get food.

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.530
One study published in the journal Philosophical
Transactions B found that crows on New Caledonia,

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.340
a South Pacific island, take stripes of leaves
and shape them into hooks to get food out

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:08.090
of tricky places, like grubs out of tree stumps.

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.650
Another study in PLOS One found that they
understand complex concepts like water displacement.

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.160
Like in Aesops fables when a bird drops a
pebble in a glass to raise the water level

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.800
so he can drink it, they can actually do that.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.470
There’s all sorts of stories of crows getting
clever for food.

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.920
In Japan, crows will place walnuts in the
middle of the road, then fly away and wait

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.830
for a car to drive over them, cracking it
open.

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.220
If it doesn’t work the first time, the crow
will move the walnut to another place in the

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:32.500
road and try again.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.630
I mean most human kids don’t know how to
use a tool to get something they want before

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.680
the age of two and can’t understand volume
displacement until the age of 5 or 7.

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.979
So you could say crows are smarter than your
average child.

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:49.850
And some studies show that they understand
analogies and there’s some anecdotal evidence

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.630
that crows do stuff for the fun of it, like
sledding down a snowy roof on a bottle cap

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.510
or putting poop in deer’s ears.

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:57.950
Yeah I’m not kidding on that one.

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.830
How do they do this if they have such tiny
and different brains.

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.860
Well one study published in the journal Nature
Communications describes how.

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.200
Most of our big brained smarts lies in the
prefrontal cortex.

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.100
Scientists think this area is responsible
for things like reason and controlling emotions.

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.150
But birds don’t have this.

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.300
Their smarts evolved convergently, or independently
from ours.

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:23.750
Instead, the seat of crow’s intelligence
lies in the nidopallium caudolaterale.

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.780
This part of the brain helps the crow form
memories, learn and even make predictions.

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.370
Why did they evolve such complicated brains?

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.770
Researchers think their environment plays
a big role.

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:38.140
The crow family can be found in variety of
ecosystems and eat a variety of food, so they’d

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.730
have to be able to adapt to changing landscapes.

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.300
Like humans, they are very social creatures.

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.099
And solving both social and ecological problems
required bigger brains.

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:49.860
and one last note, don’t be a dick to a
bird.

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:50.870
He’ll remember.

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.709
Scientists from the university of Washington
found that the birds would remember faces

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:56.420
that were mean to them in the past.

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.860
Whenever the researchers walked around campus,
the birds that they had previously captured

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.500
or trapped would scold them!

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.450
But not just those birds, other crows that
had never been trapped before also scolded

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:07.450
the researchers!

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:08.670
Which means the crows are a talking.

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:41.609
If you piss one off, you might piss off a
whole murder.
