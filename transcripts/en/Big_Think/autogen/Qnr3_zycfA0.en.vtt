revolution in in international relations
 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.190
revolution in in international relations
and it's one which is both going to

and it's one which is both going to
 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.780
and it's one which is both going to
become more important within Europe

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790
become more important within Europe
 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.310
become more important within Europe
itself as more and more countries join

up with with many more countries in it
 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.520

parts of the world in Latin America
 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.120
parts of the world in Latin America
they're developing a medical surely and

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130
they're developing a medical surely and
 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.760
they're developing a medical surely and
Africa the African Union and even in

the world has got its own regional

the world has got its own regional
unions and you see the development of

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130
unions and you see the development of
 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.429
unions and you see the development of
new international organizations based on

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439
new international organizations based on
 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.319
new international organizations based on
the principles with which the European

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329
the principles with which the European
 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.840
the principles with which the European
Union is run what you could see is a

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850
Union is run what you could see is a
 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.520
Union is run what you could see is a
European century not because you're it

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530
European century not because you're it
 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:59.990
European century not because you're it
runs the world like an empire but

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000
runs the world like an empire but
 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.429
runs the world like an empire but
because the European way of doing things

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439
because the European way of doing things
 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:02.780
because the European way of doing things
becomes the world's way of doing things

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790
becomes the world's way of doing things
 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.380
becomes the world's way of doing things
I both think that that is likely to

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390
I both think that that is likely to
 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:07.880
I both think that that is likely to
happen just because there's so many

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890
happen just because there's so many
 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.680
happen just because there's so many
problems that cut across borders now we

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690
problems that cut across borders now we
 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.089
problems that cut across borders now we
need to have fresh thinking about how we

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099
need to have fresh thinking about how we
 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.830
need to have fresh thinking about how we
deal with them and the opinion is the

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840
deal with them and the opinion is the
 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.770
deal with them and the opinion is the
most innovative and

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780
most innovative and
 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.199
most innovative and
flexible way of dealing with them and

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209
flexible way of dealing with them and
 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:17.730
flexible way of dealing with them and
secondly I think it would be a much

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740
secondly I think it would be a much
 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.500
secondly I think it would be a much
better world if it's run like that than

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510
better world if it's run like that than
 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.690
better world if it's run like that than
the status quo so I hope I'm right as

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700
the status quo so I hope I'm right as
 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:30.240
the status quo so I hope I'm right as
well I think that like a lot of imperial

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250
well I think that like a lot of imperial
 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.780
well I think that like a lot of imperial
projects the European Union is doomed to

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790
projects the European Union is doomed to
 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.120
projects the European Union is doomed to
carry on expanding but it's not

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130
carry on expanding but it's not
 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:37.860
carry on expanding but it's not
something which will happen in in one go

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870
something which will happen in in one go
 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.090
something which will happen in in one go
but very few people that know 120 years

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100
but very few people that know 120 years
 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:43.350
but very few people that know 120 years
ago would have predicted that there'd be

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360
ago would have predicted that there'd be
 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.420
ago would have predicted that there'd be
27 member states in the European Union

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430
27 member states in the European Union
 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.759
27 member states in the European Union
and it would stretch as far as you know

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:47.769
and it would stretch as far as you know
 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:51.990
and it would stretch as far as you know
as places like Estonia and I I think you

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000
as places like Estonia and I I think you
 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.090
as places like Estonia and I I think you
know in 20 30 years time it's quite

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100
know in 20 30 years time it's quite
 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.340
know in 20 30 years time it's quite
likely that there'll be a whole new

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350
likely that there'll be a whole new
 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:57.720
likely that there'll be a whole new
swathe of countries in the European

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730
swathe of countries in the European
 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.590
swathe of countries in the European
Union like turkey Ukraine Moldova maybe

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600
Union like turkey Ukraine Moldova maybe
 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:06.650
Union like turkey Ukraine Moldova maybe
even Belarus one day but at the moment

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660
even Belarus one day but at the moment
 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.259
even Belarus one day but at the moment
just as we've seen in the past after

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:10.269
just as we've seen in the past after
 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:12.150
just as we've seen in the past after
every time after every wave of

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160
every time after every wave of
 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:13.620
every time after every wave of
enlargement there's a lot of skepticism

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630
enlargement there's a lot of skepticism
 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.320
enlargement there's a lot of skepticism
for citizens people turn against the

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.330
for citizens people turn against the
 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:19.259
for citizens people turn against the
idea of further expansion you know there

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269
idea of further expansion you know there
 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:20.819
idea of further expansion you know there
is a pause going on and people are quite

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:20.829
is a pause going on and people are quite
 

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:22.319
is a pause going on and people are quite
skeptical about it but I think there

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:22.329
skeptical about it but I think there
 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:24.210
skeptical about it but I think there
there is a natural tendency to look

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220
there is a natural tendency to look
 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:25.979
there is a natural tendency to look
outwards because each wave of countries

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989
outwards because each wave of countries
 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:28.170
outwards because each wave of countries
that joins the European Union wants to

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180
that joins the European Union wants to
 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:29.670
that joins the European Union wants to
make sure that its neighbors get in as

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680
make sure that its neighbors get in as
 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:30.900
make sure that its neighbors get in as
well because it will make them more

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910
well because it will make them more
 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:32.850
well because it will make them more
peaceful more democratic and it will

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:32.860
peaceful more democratic and it will
 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:34.620
peaceful more democratic and it will
increase their economic opportunities

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630
increase their economic opportunities
 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:37.080
increase their economic opportunities
and that's why that the people who are

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090
and that's why that the people who are
 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.000
and that's why that the people who are
keenest for the European Union to carry

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010
keenest for the European Union to carry
 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:40.800
keenest for the European Union to carry
on enlarging of those countries of the

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810
