model which is what we bring to the
 

01:21:31.830 --> 01:21:35.510
model which is what we bring to the
table as an organization and there are

01:21:35.510 --> 01:21:35.520
table as an organization and there are
 

01:21:35.520 --> 01:21:39.170

that data when any external interactions
 

01:22:01.410 --> 01:22:04.460
that data when any external interactions
happen is very high right so it's it's

01:22:04.460 --> 01:22:04.470

dealt with y2k and what happened during
 

01:22:21.660 --> 01:22:25.460
dealt with y2k and what happened during
that time right and the the model of

01:22:25.460 --> 01:22:25.470
that time right and the the model of
 

01:22:25.470 --> 01:22:28.180
that time right and the the model of
having a factory based approach to

01:22:28.180 --> 01:22:28.190
having a factory based approach to
 

01:22:28.190 --> 01:22:31.370
having a factory based approach to
looking at what systems existed and

01:22:31.370 --> 01:22:31.380
looking at what systems existed and
 

01:22:31.380 --> 01:22:33.920
looking at what systems existed and
moving them and migrating them into new

01:22:33.920 --> 01:22:33.930
moving them and migrating them into new
 

01:22:33.930 --> 01:22:36.320

set of systems that's what's happening
 

01:22:36.330 --> 01:22:39.530
set of systems that's what's happening
today with the move to cloud of course

01:22:39.530 --> 01:22:39.540
today with the move to cloud of course
 

01:22:39.540 --> 01:22:41.420
today with the move to cloud of course
cloud has much more potential than that

01:22:41.420 --> 01:22:41.430
cloud has much more potential than that
 

01:22:41.430 --> 01:22:44.660
cloud has much more potential than that
but the early adoption of cloud is

01:22:44.660 --> 01:22:44.670
but the early adoption of cloud is
 

01:22:44.670 --> 01:22:46.430
but the early adoption of cloud is
happening in this space so if these are

01:22:46.430 --> 01:22:46.440
happening in this space so if these are

technology drivers behind business 4.2
there are four behavioral elements which

01:22:53.810 --> 01:22:53.820
there are four behavioral elements which
 

01:22:53.820 --> 01:22:55.610
there are four behavioral elements which
hasn't changed since the first

01:22:55.610 --> 01:22:55.620
hasn't changed since the first
 

01:22:55.620 --> 01:22:57.620
hasn't changed since the first
Industrial Revolution it continues to

01:22:57.620 --> 01:22:57.630
Industrial Revolution it continues to
 

01:22:57.630 --> 01:22:58.479
Industrial Revolution it continues to
remain the same

01:22:58.479 --> 01:22:58.489
remain the same
 

01:22:58.489 --> 01:23:02.419
remain the same
but the very interpret and use it has

01:23:02.419 --> 01:23:02.429
but the very interpret and use it has
 

01:23:02.429 --> 01:23:05.390
but the very interpret and use it has
changed over time so if you look at it

01:23:05.390 --> 01:23:05.400
changed over time so if you look at it
 

01:23:05.400 --> 01:23:08.930
changed over time so if you look at it
today mass customization or tailoring it

01:23:08.930 --> 01:23:08.940
today mass customization or tailoring it
 

01:23:08.940 --> 01:23:12.680
today mass customization or tailoring it
to the segment of one this has always

01:23:12.680 --> 01:23:12.690
to the segment of one this has always
 

01:23:12.690 --> 01:23:15.649
to the segment of one this has always
been the case if you look at 20 30 years

01:23:15.649 --> 01:23:15.659
been the case if you look at 20 30 years
 

01:23:15.659 --> 01:23:18.649
been the case if you look at 20 30 years
ago businesses where again all about

01:23:18.649 --> 01:23:18.659
ago businesses where again all about
 

01:23:18.659 --> 01:23:20.149

everything that you do right so it's not
 

01:23:22.349 --> 01:23:25.700
everything that you do right so it's not
very different but what has happened

01:23:25.700 --> 01:23:25.710
very different but what has happened
 

01:23:25.710 --> 01:23:26.060
very different but what has happened
today

a more cost-effective manner in a manner

01:23:40.790 --> 01:23:40.800
a more cost-effective manner in a manner
 

01:23:40.800 --> 01:23:43.549
a more cost-effective manner in a manner
where you can play around and scale

01:23:43.549 --> 01:23:43.559
where you can play around and scale
 

01:23:43.559 --> 01:23:46.339
where you can play around and scale
things pretty quickly in a manner where

01:23:46.339 --> 01:23:46.349
things pretty quickly in a manner where
 

01:23:46.349 --> 01:23:48.709
things pretty quickly in a manner where
you are able to see results and the

01:23:48.709 --> 01:23:48.719
you are able to see results and the
 

01:23:48.719 --> 01:23:51.200
you are able to see results and the
feedback loop is much faster right so

01:23:51.200 --> 01:23:51.210
feedback loop is much faster right so
 

01:23:51.210 --> 01:23:54.979
feedback loop is much faster right so
mass customization and this for example

01:23:54.979 --> 01:23:54.989
mass customization and this for example
 

01:23:54.989 --> 01:23:56.600
mass customization and this for example
if you look at what's happening with

01:23:56.600 --> 01:23:56.610
if you look at what's happening with
 

01:23:56.610 --> 01:24:00.219

all of that is one of the first few

01:24:09.770 --> 01:24:09.780
all of that is one of the first few

customization the second aspect is

01:24:16.339 --> 01:24:16.349
customization the second aspect is
 

01:24:16.349 --> 01:24:19.100
customization the second aspect is
creating exponential value which means

01:24:19.100 --> 01:24:19.110
creating exponential value which means
 

01:24:19.110 --> 01:24:22.520
creating exponential value which means
that using the limited resources or the

01:24:22.520 --> 01:24:22.530
that using the limited resources or the
 

01:24:22.530 --> 01:24:24.489
that using the limited resources or the
resources that are available to have a

01:24:24.489 --> 01:24:24.499
resources that are available to have a
 

01:24:24.499 --> 01:24:28.219
resources that are available to have a
multiplier effect and that's what is the

01:24:28.219 --> 01:24:28.229
multiplier effect and that's what is the
 

01:24:28.229 --> 01:24:30.109
multiplier effect and that's what is the
second concept again something very

01:24:30.109 --> 01:24:30.119
second concept again something very
 

01:24:30.119 --> 01:24:33.649
second concept again something very
linked to productivity but in this is

01:24:33.649 --> 01:24:33.659
linked to productivity but in this is
 

01:24:33.659 --> 01:24:35.750
linked to productivity but in this is
not just about productivity this is

01:24:35.750 --> 01:24:35.760
not just about productivity this is
 

01:24:35.760 --> 01:24:37.459
not just about productivity this is
about growth and transformation and

01:24:37.459 --> 01:24:37.469
about growth and transformation and
 

01:24:37.469 --> 01:24:40.520
about growth and transformation and
that's what thinking about it from a

01:24:40.520 --> 01:24:40.530
that's what thinking about it from a
 

01:24:40.530 --> 01:24:43.370
that's what thinking about it from a
exponential value perspective brings him

01:24:43.370 --> 01:24:43.380
exponential value perspective brings him
 

01:24:43.380 --> 01:24:47.239
exponential value perspective brings him
right so the exponential value to larges

01:24:47.239 --> 01:24:47.249
right so the exponential value to larges
 

01:24:47.249 --> 01:24:50.450
right so the exponential value to larges
lines of business within customers but

functions and when I when I first
learned about this and a couple of days

01:25:06.770 --> 01:25:06.780
learned about this and a couple of days
 

01:25:06.780 --> 01:25:10.459
learned about this and a couple of days
ago when I heard the introductory speech

and I think that's where liberating
 

01:25:18.420 --> 01:25:20.930
and I think that's where liberating
ecosystems comes into play because you

could imagine that but you couldn't
 

01:26:09.750 --> 01:26:11.930
could imagine that but you couldn't
deliver it because the constraints that

01:26:11.930 --> 01:26:11.940
deliver it because the constraints that
 

01:26:11.940 --> 01:26:13.580

01:32:51.220 --> 01:32:51.230
that 65 percent of students who are
 

01:32:51.230 --> 01:32:54.129
that 65 percent of students who are
entering primary school today are going

01:32:54.129 --> 01:32:54.139
entering primary school today are going
 

01:32:54.139 --> 01:32:57.339
entering primary school today are going
to be in jobs that do not exist yet how

01:32:57.339 --> 01:32:57.349
to be in jobs that do not exist yet how
 

01:32:57.349 --> 01:33:01.899
to be in jobs that do not exist yet how
do you prepare a world where you don't

01:33:01.899 --> 01:33:01.909
do you prepare a world where you don't
 

01:33:01.909 --> 01:33:05.919
do you prepare a world where you don't
know what the jobs of the future are

01:33:05.919 --> 01:33:05.929
know what the jobs of the future are
 

01:33:05.929 --> 01:33:10.270
know what the jobs of the future are
going to look like and believe me these

01:33:10.270 --> 01:33:10.280
going to look like and believe me these
 

01:33:10.280 --> 01:33:12.370
going to look like and believe me these
kids who are participating these

01:33:12.370 --> 01:33:12.380
kids who are participating these
 

01:33:12.380 --> 01:33:14.020
kids who are participating these
opportunities they know where to go they

01:33:14.020 --> 01:33:14.030
opportunities they know where to go they
 

01:33:14.030 --> 01:33:16.330
opportunities they know where to go they
know how to go but as society if you

01:33:16.330 --> 01:33:16.340
know how to go but as society if you
 

01:33:16.340 --> 01:33:21.209
know how to go but as society if you
look at it in scale and the disparate

01:33:21.209 --> 01:33:21.219
 
 

01:33:21.219 --> 01:33:23.950
 
systems that exist across countries and

01:33:23.950 --> 01:33:23.960
systems that exist across countries and
 

01:33:23.960 --> 01:33:27.370
systems that exist across countries and
across continents then the problem that

01:33:27.370 --> 01:33:27.380
across continents then the problem that
 

01:33:27.380 --> 01:33:29.109
across continents then the problem that
we're dealing with is totally different

01:33:29.109 --> 01:33:29.119
we're dealing with is totally different
 

01:33:29.119 --> 01:33:32.979
we're dealing with is totally different
right so not only do we have to envisage

01:33:32.979 --> 01:33:32.989
right so not only do we have to envisage
 

01:33:32.989 --> 01:33:37.089
right so not only do we have to envisage
the future and understand what is what

01:33:37.089 --> 01:33:37.099
the future and understand what is what
 

01:33:37.099 --> 01:33:39.640
the future and understand what is what
what that win is going to look like we

01:33:39.640 --> 01:33:39.650
what that win is going to look like we
 

01:33:39.650 --> 01:33:41.740
what that win is going to look like we
then have to translate it backwards to

01:33:41.740 --> 01:33:41.750
then have to translate it backwards to
 

01:33:41.750 --> 01:33:46.000
then have to translate it backwards to
how this is unfold and what can we do

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:46.010
how this is unfold and what can we do
 

01:33:46.010 --> 01:33:49.149
how this is unfold and what can we do
today that can prepare people for that

01:33:49.149 --> 01:33:49.159
today that can prepare people for that
 

01:33:49.159 --> 01:33:52.930
today that can prepare people for that
future tomorrow right and the third

01:33:52.930 --> 01:33:52.940
future tomorrow right and the third
 

01:33:52.940 --> 01:33:55.479
future tomorrow right and the third
element I'll put in front of you the

01:33:55.479 --> 01:33:55.489
element I'll put in front of you the
 

01:33:55.489 --> 01:33:58.689
element I'll put in front of you the
third statistic to frame this problem is

01:33:58.689 --> 01:33:58.699
third statistic to frame this problem is
 

01:33:58.699 --> 01:34:03.009
third statistic to frame this problem is
that I mentioned earlier that technology

01:34:03.009 --> 01:34:03.019
that I mentioned earlier that technology
 

01:34:03.019 --> 01:34:03.880
that I mentioned earlier that technology
also come

01:34:03.880 --> 01:34:03.890
also come
 

01:34:03.890 --> 01:34:08.860
also come
with some challenges right and many of

01:34:08.860 --> 01:34:08.870
with some challenges right and many of
 

01:34:08.870 --> 01:34:11.080
with some challenges right and many of
us have seen and heard the doomsday

01:34:11.080 --> 01:34:11.090
us have seen and heard the doomsday
 

01:34:11.090 --> 01:34:13.150
us have seen and heard the doomsday
scenarios of millions of jobs are going

01:34:13.150 --> 01:34:13.160
scenarios of millions of jobs are going
 

01:34:13.160 --> 01:34:15.670
scenarios of millions of jobs are going
to be lost because of automation and new

01:34:15.670 --> 01:34:15.680
to be lost because of automation and new
 

01:34:15.680 --> 01:34:17.830
to be lost because of automation and new
technology adoption but I don't

01:34:17.830 --> 01:34:17.840
technology adoption but I don't
 

01:34:17.840 --> 01:34:20.680
technology adoption but I don't
subscribe to that view entirely the

01:34:20.680 --> 01:34:20.690
subscribe to that view entirely the
 

01:34:20.690 --> 01:34:22.960
subscribe to that view entirely the
thing the element of truth that is there

01:34:22.960 --> 01:34:22.970
thing the element of truth that is there
 

01:34:22.970 --> 01:34:24.940
thing the element of truth that is there
there are two elements of truth one is

01:34:24.940 --> 01:34:24.950
there are two elements of truth one is
 

01:34:24.950 --> 01:34:28.660
there are two elements of truth one is
that what we call as a job is going to

01:34:28.660 --> 01:34:28.670
that what we call as a job is going to
 

01:34:28.670 --> 01:34:31.240
that what we call as a job is going to
change so the skills that are required

01:34:31.240 --> 01:34:31.250
change so the skills that are required
 

01:34:31.250 --> 01:34:33.580
change so the skills that are required
while some may remain and some part of

while some may remain and some part of
 

01:34:33.590 --> 01:34:36.010
while some may remain and some part of
that work will remain some part of that

01:34:36.010 --> 01:34:36.020
that work will remain some part of that
 

01:34:36.020 --> 01:34:38.860
that work will remain some part of that
work will go away and as you can imagine

01:34:38.860 --> 01:34:38.870
work will go away and as you can imagine
 

01:34:38.870 --> 01:34:41.140
work will go away and as you can imagine
it is going to be the mundane and the

01:34:41.140 --> 01:34:41.150
it is going to be the mundane and the
 

01:34:41.150 --> 01:34:43.480
it is going to be the mundane and the
repetitive aspects of what we do today

01:34:43.480 --> 01:34:43.490
repetitive aspects of what we do today
 

01:34:43.490 --> 01:34:46.660
repetitive aspects of what we do today
in our jobs that is going to change but

01:34:46.660 --> 01:34:46.670
in our jobs that is going to change but
 

01:34:46.670 --> 01:34:48.760
in our jobs that is going to change but
as a result of that there are going to

01:34:48.760 --> 01:34:48.770
as a result of that there are going to
 

01:34:48.770 --> 01:34:50.980
as a result of that there are going to
be some work streams some career paths

01:34:50.980 --> 01:34:50.990
be some work streams some career paths
 

01:34:50.990 --> 01:34:54.220
be some work streams some career paths
some jobs that will disappear and that's

01:34:54.220 --> 01:34:54.230
some jobs that will disappear and that's
 

01:34:54.230 --> 01:34:55.780
some jobs that will disappear and that's
been the case with every Industrial

01:34:55.780 --> 01:34:55.790
been the case with every Industrial
 

01:34:55.790 --> 01:34:59.500
been the case with every Industrial
Revolution that's happened the second

element of truth which is troubling is

01:35:01.840 --> 01:35:01.850
element of truth which is troubling is
 

01:35:01.850 --> 01:35:05.410
element of truth which is troubling is
that if you are a woman or if you are a

01:35:05.410 --> 01:35:05.420
that if you are a woman or if you are a
 

01:35:05.420 --> 01:35:08.710
that if you are a woman or if you are a
person from a minority background the

01:35:08.710 --> 01:35:08.720
person from a minority background the
 

01:35:08.720 --> 01:35:12.120
person from a minority background the
impact on you is going to be much higher

01:35:12.120 --> 01:35:12.130
impact on you is going to be much higher
 

01:35:12.130 --> 01:35:15.670
impact on you is going to be much higher
and that's where the burden of what is

01:35:15.670 --> 01:35:15.680
and that's where the burden of what is
 

01:35:15.680 --> 01:35:17.380
and that's where the burden of what is
going to happen is going to fall on

01:35:17.380 --> 01:35:17.390
going to happen is going to fall on
 

01:35:17.390 --> 01:35:22.180
going to happen is going to fall on
those who already don't have what it the

01:35:22.180 --> 01:35:22.190
those who already don't have what it the
 

01:35:22.190 --> 01:35:25.120
those who already don't have what it the
kind of support that is needed or the

01:35:25.120 --> 01:35:25.130
kind of support that is needed or the
 

01:35:25.130 --> 01:35:27.820
kind of support that is needed or the
opportunities that are needed right but

01:35:27.820 --> 01:35:27.830
opportunities that are needed right but
 

01:35:27.830 --> 01:35:31.660
opportunities that are needed right but
even with all of that I believe that we

01:35:31.660 --> 01:35:31.670
even with all of that I believe that we
 

01:35:31.670 --> 01:35:35.020
even with all of that I believe that we
have a great future ahead of us because

01:35:35.020 --> 01:35:35.030
have a great future ahead of us because
 

01:35:35.030 --> 01:35:38.920
have a great future ahead of us because
I don't believe that machines are going

01:35:38.920 --> 01:35:38.930
I don't believe that machines are going
 

01:35:38.930 --> 01:35:41.200
I don't believe that machines are going
to take over I believe that it's going

01:35:41.200 --> 01:35:41.210
to take over I believe that it's going
 

01:35:41.210 --> 01:35:43.720
to take over I believe that it's going
to be the people like you and me we're

01:35:43.720 --> 01:35:43.730
to be the people like you and me we're
 

01:35:43.730 --> 01:35:46.780
to be the people like you and me we're
going to determine where our world heads

01:35:46.780 --> 01:35:46.790
going to determine where our world heads
 

01:35:46.790 --> 01:35:50.440
going to determine where our world heads
next of course that means that we need

01:35:50.440 --> 01:35:50.450
next of course that means that we need
 

01:35:50.450 --> 01:35:53.050
next of course that means that we need
to be responsible we need to think about

01:35:53.050 --> 01:35:53.060
to be responsible we need to think about
 

01:35:53.060 --> 01:35:55.990
to be responsible we need to think about
what kind of boundaries we put around

01:35:55.990 --> 01:35:56.000
what kind of boundaries we put around
 

01:35:56.000 --> 01:36:00.670
what kind of boundaries we put around
how we innovate and doing it in a way

01:36:00.670 --> 01:36:00.680
how we innovate and doing it in a way
 

01:36:00.680 --> 01:36:03.760
how we innovate and doing it in a way
that is not just fair and just but also

01:36:03.760 --> 01:36:03.770
that is not just fair and just but also
 

01:36:03.770 --> 01:36:08.740
that is not just fair and just but also
equitable right so how are we doing that

01:36:08.740 --> 01:36:08.750
equitable right so how are we doing that
 

01:36:08.750 --> 01:36:11.560
equitable right so how are we doing that
and what what kind of thoughts can I

01:36:11.560 --> 01:36:11.570
and what what kind of thoughts can I
 

01:36:11.570 --> 01:36:13.330
and what what kind of thoughts can I
bring to the tables from the experiences

01:36:13.330 --> 01:36:13.340
bring to the tables from the experiences
 

01:36:13.340 --> 01:36:16.310
bring to the tables from the experiences
that we have had as an organization

01:36:16.310 --> 01:36:16.320
that we have had as an organization
 

01:36:16.320 --> 01:36:18.500
that we have had as an organization
to bring to this discussion and then I

01:36:18.500 --> 01:36:18.510
to bring to this discussion and then I
 

01:36:18.510 --> 01:36:20.120
to bring to this discussion and then I
will open it up for questions and

01:36:20.120 --> 01:36:20.130
will open it up for questions and
 

01:36:20.130 --> 01:36:22.430
will open it up for questions and
interaction on what other ideas we could

01:36:22.430 --> 01:36:22.440
interaction on what other ideas we could
 

01:36:22.440 --> 01:36:26.629
interaction on what other ideas we could
have so as a company with 380,000

01:36:26.629 --> 01:36:26.639
have so as a company with 380,000
 

01:36:26.639 --> 01:36:30.140
have so as a company with 380,000
employees around the world we have a few

01:36:30.140 --> 01:36:30.150
employees around the world we have a few
 

01:36:30.150 --> 01:36:33.379
employees around the world we have a few
things that work really well for us it

01:36:33.379 --> 01:36:33.389
things that work really well for us it
 

01:36:33.389 --> 01:36:36.399
things that work really well for us it
is the talent and the abundance of

01:36:36.399 --> 01:36:36.409
is the talent and the abundance of
 

01:36:36.409 --> 01:36:39.379
is the talent and the abundance of
talent that is the starting point so

01:36:39.379 --> 01:36:39.389
talent that is the starting point so
 

01:36:39.389 --> 01:36:41.950
talent that is the starting point so
rather than look at this as a problem of

01:36:41.950 --> 01:36:41.960
rather than look at this as a problem of
 

01:36:41.960 --> 01:36:44.390
rather than look at this as a problem of
you know do we need these many employees

01:36:44.390 --> 01:36:44.400
you know do we need these many employees
 

01:36:44.400 --> 01:36:46.069
you know do we need these many employees

what's going to happen it implies in the
future we looked at it as an opportunity

01:36:49.510 --> 01:36:49.520
future we looked at it as an opportunity
 

01:36:49.520 --> 01:36:53.330

sector or in oil and gas we are doing a
 

02:13:56.030 --> 02:13:57.460
sector or in oil and gas we are doing a
lot of efforts that I can't talk about

02:13:57.460 --> 02:13:57.470
lot of efforts that I can't talk about
 

02:13:57.470 --> 02:14:01.210

because of client confidentiality but we

02:14:01.210 --> 02:14:01.220
because of client confidentiality but we
 

02:14:01.220 --> 02:14:03.700
because of client confidentiality but we
are certainly right there so it is our

02:14:03.700 --> 02:14:03.710

customers reimagine how to move from

02:14:10.930 --> 02:14:10.940
customers reimagine how to move from
 

02:14:10.940 --> 02:14:12.730
customers reimagine how to move from
where they are today to adopt these

02:14:12.730 --> 02:14:12.740
where they are today to adopt these
 

02:14:12.740 --> 02:14:15.610
where they are today to adopt these
technologies and then bring it to their

02:14:15.610 --> 02:14:15.620
technologies and then bring it to their
 

02:14:15.620 --> 02:14:18.280
technologies and then bring it to their
customers they are in consumer so that's

02:14:18.280 --> 02:14:18.290
customers they are in consumer so that's
 

02:14:18.290 --> 02:14:19.420
customers they are in consumer so that's
the space that we're going to continue

02:14:19.420 --> 02:14:19.430
the space that we're going to continue
 

02:14:19.430 --> 02:14:21.820
the space that we're going to continue
operating in but I wish I'm looking

02:14:21.820 --> 02:14:21.830
operating in but I wish I'm looking
 

02:14:21.830 --> 02:14:25.600
operating in but I wish I'm looking
forward to a day when a robo will run

02:14:25.600 --> 02:14:25.610
forward to a day when a robo will run
 

02:14:25.610 --> 02:14:28.570
forward to a day when a robo will run
the New York City Marathon so that's

02:14:28.570 --> 02:14:28.580
the New York City Marathon so that's
 

02:14:28.580 --> 02:14:31.000
the New York City Marathon so that's
that's something you know I'm looking

02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:31.010
that's something you know I'm looking
 

02:14:31.010 --> 02:14:33.550
that's something you know I'm looking
forward to and so let's have one last

so staying grounded having perspective

02:15:09.400 --> 02:15:09.410
so staying grounded having perspective
 

02:15:09.410 --> 02:15:11.320
so staying grounded having perspective
is the starting point and then the rest

02:15:11.320 --> 02:15:11.330
