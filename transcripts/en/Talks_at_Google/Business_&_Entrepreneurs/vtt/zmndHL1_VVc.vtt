00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.695
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.695 --> 00:00:07.820
HENRY SHI: Hello, everyone.

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:10.490
Thank you for having me here.

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:13.750
So before I start, just
curious how many of you

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:15.550
are working on AI stuff?

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:17.266
Raise your hand.

00:00:17.266 --> 00:00:18.010
Oh, a lot.

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.920
So today, my topic is
"AI Startup Ecosystem

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.080
in the US and China."

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.280
I will provide some
comparative perspectives

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:33.630
on the two ecosystems.

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:41.650
So many of you have noticed
that AI startups grow rapidly.

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:44.610
So if you look at AI
unicorns-- "unicorns"

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.960
meaning startups have over
$1 billion valuations--

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.060
there are 32 AI
unicorns by 2018.

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.990
So this is reported
by CB Insights.

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:02.050
This is about 10% of
the whole unicorn club.

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:06.420
And this percentage
is continue growing.

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.080
Note that there's 17 companies
from US, 10 from China.

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:16.300
So it looks like US has
more AI unicorns than China.

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.930
But if we look at
this figure, we

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:23.740
look at top five most-funded
AI unicorns, actually

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.230
China has three.

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:33.100
And the most two well-funded
AI unicorns are from China.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.590
Maybe you are not familiar
with some of the companies.

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.740
I will provide you a
little bit background.

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.900
The first well-funded
company is called ByteDance.

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.070
Actually, they have a big
office in Culver City.

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.990
ByteDance raised $3 billion.

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:51.520
It's a Chinese company.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.110
It has a number of products,
but the two main products, one

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.750
is Toutiao, which is
AI-powered news app.

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.940
It has over 500 million
monthly active users.

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.390
The second one, which is
probably more popular,

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.470
called TikTok, they
have over 500 million

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.320
monthly active users globally.

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:19.790
This is a AI-powered
short video sharing app.

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.250
If you haven't used
it, please have a try.

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:29.800
Now, the second well-funded AI
company is called SenseTime.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.960
The company raised $2.6 billion,
and focuses on computer vision.

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:39.970
Now, SenseTime has over
700 enterprise customers

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.540
and strategic partners globally.

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:49.480
It has applications over
more than 10 industries.

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.630
The main technology, or
product, of SenseTime

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.370
is facial recognition.

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.250
Their facial recognition
service is serving

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:58.720
over 400 million people.

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.160
So the fifth well-funded
company is called UBTech.

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.900
It's another Chinese company.

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.840
This company is building
this service robotics.

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.520
This looks human-like robotics,
are produced by UBTech.

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.800
There's a lot of robotics.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:21.660
So the revenue in 2018 is
actually over $300 million.

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.850
So they sell these
robots very well.

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:30.240
And their sales increased over
500 times within four years.

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.930
Now, if we look at the two
other companies from the US,

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:42.300
they are autonomous driving
companies, Nuro and Argo.

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.160
They both raised $1 billion.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.660
Nuro is a little bit different.

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.800
They are building
this self-driving car

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.650
for food delivery,
while it can also

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.880
deliver other stuff later on.

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.722
Argo AI is more like standard
self-driving car company.

00:03:58.722 --> 00:04:00.180
They're building
self-driving cars.

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:08.060
We notice that these five top
most well-funded AI companies,

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.550
they are all funded
within a few years.

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:13.580
And there are so
many other unicorns.

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:15.570
They grow so rapidly.

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:19.760
So the question I want to ask
is, why are these AI startups

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.880
growing so rapidly?

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.580
There are a couple of reasons.

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.150
First, there's
continuous progress

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:32.560
in data processing, computing
power, and algorithms.

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.140
If we look at these
two figures, this

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:38.530
is some statistics
on ImageNet data set.

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:41.650
I think many of you
should know that.

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:46.740
If we look at the classification
accuracy on ImageNet data set,

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.240
the accuracy
continues to improve.

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:55.090
In 2014, and actually after
2014, it beats humans,

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:58.520
and now it continues to improve.

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.700
Another very
interesting observation

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:05.015
is that in the past year
or two, the training time

00:05:05.015 --> 00:05:08.050
on the ImageNet to building
these machine learning models

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:11.920
actually drops
dramatically, thanks

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:17.090
to all this parallel
computing, cloud computing.

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:20.920
Now, the second reason for the
rapid growth of AI companies

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:24.950
is the significant growth
of venture capital into AI.

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:30.160
So this figure shows the global
AI investments year by year.

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.640
We can see that the trend is
that VC money is growing year

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:35.262
by year into AI.

00:05:35.262 --> 00:05:40.570
And in 2008, the VC
money total actually

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:46.800
is 70% up, compared to 2017.

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:52.150
Now, this curve actually
shows the number of deals.

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:55.230
So interestingly,
in 2018, the number

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:58.200
of deals that raised
money is actually

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:02.970
fewer than that in 2017.

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:09.100
And we observe large
rounds, but fewer deals.

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:11.330
Fewer deals meaning
fewer companies

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:15.380
actually raised money.

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:16.630
So why is that?

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:21.490
Why, given that so
much money is into AI,

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:27.700
but money are concentrated on
deals, on these fewer deals?

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:29.330
There are a couple of reasons.

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:33.100
But the main point is
that in some AI fields,

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:34.750
the bigger gets bigger.

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:37.660
Basically, big
companies, big startups,

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:40.520
are easier to
attract more money.

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:42.190
So there are a
couple of reasons.

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:44.950
So one is the data
network effect,

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:48.940
because these AI unicorns tend
to collect more and more data.

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:52.030
And these data actually
provide the company

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:54.920
more advances in technology.

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:57.730
Secondly, these AI
unicorns are easier

00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:00.130
to attract more AI talents.

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:02.950
And you know more
AI talents means

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:07.370
you have more power, in terms
of technology development.

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:09.730
Certainly, these AI
unicorns are easier

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:12.310
to expand to more territories.

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:16.860
TikTok, as I said, the
core product of ByteDance,

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:21.190
they are actually expanded
to the US, Asia, and Europe.

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:24.505
Now they have over 500 million
monthly active users globally.

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:31.520
The fourth reason is that these
bigger AI startups can expand

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:33.920
to more industries easier.

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:35.750
SenseTime, as
example, they already

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:38.734
covers over 10 industries.

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:44.390
Now, a natural question
to ask is, will there

00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:46.640
be more capital into AI?

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:48.650
Probably yes.

00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:53.330
If you look at US VC
market, 2018 is actually

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:55.610
a record-breaking year.

00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:58.760
So this shows the
total venture capital

00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:01.610
money raised by US startups.

00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:06.860
In 2018, the amount is
significantly larger

00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:10.960
than 2017 and the years before.

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:15.160
So looks like this is great
timing for US AI startups,

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:19.660
because there's a lot
of money in the market.

00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:21.450
What about China?

00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:27.970
In 2017, actually, the AI
funding, the VC money in China,

00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:31.330
exceeds the US.

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:36.070
The total funding in
China is about 48%

00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:38.240
of the total AI
funding globally,

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:40.900
while US has only 78%--

00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:41.634
sorry, 38%.

00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:47.420
But things are getting changing.

00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:52.270
So if you look at this
figure, starting from 2018,

00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:56.350
so the number of deals and also
the amount of venture capital

00:08:56.350 --> 00:08:58.820
money in China is decreasing.

00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:02.090
So in China, startups
and VCs are facing

00:09:02.090 --> 00:09:05.460
so-called "capital winter."

00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:07.090
Why is that?

00:09:07.090 --> 00:09:09.260
There's multiple reasons.

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.950
One reason is the
slowing economy of China.

00:09:11.950 --> 00:09:15.070
And secondly also, because
of the falling share

00:09:15.070 --> 00:09:19.360
price of the tech giants,
people are afraid of the market.

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:21.590
There could be
some other reasons,

00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:25.780
but the main point is that
in China, the VC market

00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:26.440
is different.

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:28.510
It's getting changing.

00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:30.985
And this may challenge
the Chinese AI unicorns.

00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:37.640
The third reason for the
rapid growth of AI unicorns

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:40.910
is the thriving
industry applications.

00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:43.160
Nowadays, you can
see AI unicorns

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:46.610
are solving big problems
in almost each industry you

00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:48.170
can imagine.

00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:51.150
I will go through
these details later.

00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:55.130
But these massive application
drives the rapid growth

00:09:55.130 --> 00:09:56.110
of AI unicorns.

00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:04.620
Now, let's ask a second
important question.

00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:08.730
Why do some AI companies grow
so rapidly in one country,

00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:10.200
but not in the other?

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:13.260
We notice that companies
like ByteDance,

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:17.910
like SenseTime, they are big
in China, but not in the US.

00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:21.270
In the US, these
autonomous driving startups

00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:25.380
raised a lot of money,
but not same in China.

00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:26.290
So why is that?

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.260
So to answer this
question, actually we

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:35.410
have four key observations.

00:10:35.410 --> 00:10:40.600
So first, for R&amp;D,
US is ahead of China.

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:46.290
Secondly, for manufacturing,
China has its own advantages.

00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:51.820
Thirdly, for B2B
industries, US is stronger.

00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:52.890
So what is B2B?

00:10:52.890 --> 00:10:56.500
B2B stands for
business to business,

00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:59.670
meaning the customers
are enterprises.

00:10:59.670 --> 00:11:03.750
Well, for B2C and B2G,
China is stronger.

00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:08.250
B2C stands for
business to consumer.

00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:10.090
All the customers are consumers.

00:11:10.090 --> 00:11:13.040
B2G, G stands for
government, meaning

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:15.190
you are serving government.

00:11:15.190 --> 00:11:19.170
So for B2C and B2G,
China is stronger.

00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:24.030
The fourth observation is
that Chinese unicorns actually

00:11:24.030 --> 00:11:28.510
are adopting some unique
growth strategies.

00:11:28.510 --> 00:11:32.830
So I will come to these
observations one by one.

00:11:32.830 --> 00:11:37.380
First, R&amp;D, US is
ahead of China.

00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:44.670
Now, if we look at AI talents,
so if we look at the talents

00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:51.930
in all AI companies, US is about
1.5x of the number of talents

00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:53.670
in China.

00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:56.370
The difference is
not that significant.

00:11:56.370 --> 00:12:00.020
But if we look at the
number of top AI talents,

00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:03.130
US has much more advantage.

00:12:03.130 --> 00:12:07.980
The top AI talents in
the US is 5.3 times

00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:09.980
of the number in China.

00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:13.140
All these AI talents are
very important for R&amp;D,

00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:16.410
for developing these
disruptive technologies.

00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:22.830
Another example is to looking
at the autonomous driving

00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:23.490
technology.

00:12:23.490 --> 00:12:26.820
This is sort of
integrated AI technology,

00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:30.390
because you are building
a complex system.

00:12:30.390 --> 00:12:32.400
This figure is very interesting.

00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:37.410
It's published by DMV in 2018.

00:12:37.410 --> 00:12:40.380
It shows the miles
per disengagement.

00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:41.410
What does it mean?

00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:45.870
It means, how many miles
can a self-driving car drive

00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:48.990
until a human gets involved?

00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:54.750
So we can see that the first one
is Waymo, developed by Google.

00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:59.070
Waymo is obviously the top
one, in terms of the test.

00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:01.770
But this is in 2018.

00:13:01.770 --> 00:13:05.880
For now, Google is
absolute leader.

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:09.760
In this chart, US
has 16 companies.

00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:11.250
China has four.

00:13:11.250 --> 00:13:13.800
Looks like US self-driving
cars companies

00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:17.950
are much more than China
and other countries.

00:13:17.950 --> 00:13:20.670
Nuro, Aurora, are
also doing well.

00:13:20.670 --> 00:13:24.610
You notice that the top five
companies are from the US,

00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:27.250
meaning they are ahead of China.

00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:31.230
Interestingly, Nuro and Aurora
are founded by ex-Googles.

00:13:31.230 --> 00:13:35.160
So Waymo is a leader in
self-driving car technology.

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:38.520
It has built a large
pool of talents.

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:43.360
Waymo actually developed
the technology 10 years ago.

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:47.430
And the larger pool of
talent developed by Waymo

00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:50.790
actually helped other
self-driving cars

00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:53.290
to do their technologies.

00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:55.785
So Google made a big
impact in the space.

00:13:59.090 --> 00:14:02.630
Now, the second observation
is that manufacturing in China

00:14:02.630 --> 00:14:06.270
has its unique advantages.

00:14:06.270 --> 00:14:07.740
Why is that?

00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:10.830
Because there is relatively
low cost of labors

00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:13.350
and raw materials in China.

00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:16.470
Manufacturing
infrastructure are mature.

00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:20.820
Highways, roads, and ports
in China are well-developed.

00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:23.890
Thirdly, there's detailed
division of tasks.

00:14:23.890 --> 00:14:27.480
So the pipeline of
manufacturing is very mature.

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:33.000
Examples are UBTech Robotics.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.510
They can produce this kind
of robotics in fairly cheaper

00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:39.360
price than anywhere else.

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:42.160
Xiaomi is another great example.

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:45.890
Xiaomi builds an
ecosystem of smart devices

00:14:45.890 --> 00:14:47.490
in relatively cheaper price.

00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:52.550
So the takeaway
for the US startups

00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:55.380
is that you can leverage
these manufacturing

00:14:55.380 --> 00:14:58.340
advantages in China.

00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:00.620
Good examples are Lime and Bird.

00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:02.780
They are building these
scooters which you

00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:05.240
can see a lot in Santa Monica.

00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:09.390
Actually, these scooters are
mainly developed in China,

00:15:09.390 --> 00:15:14.870
and these companies can cover
the cost just within 20 days.

00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:17.810
Turing is one
example, the company

00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:20.390
we invested, doing
security robots.

00:15:20.390 --> 00:15:23.840
It can patrol
indoors and outdoors.

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:27.140
Because the hardware are
manufactured in China,

00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:31.520
it's 80% cheaper than
its US competitors.

00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:36.740
So companies here should trying
to leverage the hardware cost

00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:37.740
advantage in China.

00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:44.450
So the third observation
is really important.

00:15:44.450 --> 00:15:50.250
So in B2B space, US startups are
stronger, where in B2C and B2G,

00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:51.830
Chinese startups are stronger.

00:15:54.590 --> 00:15:58.060
So we actually calculated
the average funding

00:15:58.060 --> 00:16:00.970
of the top three
startup in each industry

00:16:00.970 --> 00:16:04.120
where AI is applying to.

00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:06.940
So the first part
is the industries

00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:09.940
that US startups raised
much more capital

00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:12.040
than those in China.

00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:14.290
And for the second
part, these are

00:16:14.290 --> 00:16:18.490
industries where Chinese
startups raised more money.

00:16:18.490 --> 00:16:21.640
And if we dig into
these two parts,

00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:25.780
we find that these industries
are more B2B industries, where

00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:29.590
your customers are
typically enterprises, where

00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:32.530
the second part,
your customers are

00:16:32.530 --> 00:16:35.213
more like consumers
and also government.

00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:43.390
So let's explain, why is that?

00:16:43.390 --> 00:16:48.460
In the US, B2B ecosystem
is well-established.

00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:53.380
That means AI startups can
get access to data easier.

00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:57.070
You see all kinds of
SaaS-model-based companies

00:16:57.070 --> 00:16:59.860
are very well-developed
in the US.

00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:04.480
And also, AI has a clear
values to enterprises,

00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:07.780
because AI can help
enterprises to lower the cost,

00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:09.790
to improve the efficiency.

00:17:09.790 --> 00:17:12.790
That's why, in the US,
a lot of enterprises

00:17:12.790 --> 00:17:16.390
are trying AI
technologies to help them.

00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:17.829
What about China?

00:17:17.829 --> 00:17:19.180
China is different.

00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:23.829
In China, US B2B ecosystem
is not well-established.

00:17:23.829 --> 00:17:27.130
The trust ecosystem,
the trust system,

00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:30.940
is not as well as
developed in the US.

00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:35.410
Also, because of the low
cost of human labors,

00:17:35.410 --> 00:17:39.460
enterprises in China
tend to hire more people,

00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:42.970
instead of trying to
using AI to lower the cost

00:17:42.970 --> 00:17:46.370
or improve the efficiency.

00:17:46.370 --> 00:17:52.490
And also, in China, B2C has
higher growth and more data.

00:17:52.490 --> 00:17:58.180
So startups doing B2C space
can access data much easier.

00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:01.660
And in China, you will see
that the mobile internet

00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:05.770
users are growing very fast.

00:18:05.770 --> 00:18:09.760
The last reason is
B2G has a higher

00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:11.750
revenue and more data in China.

00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:14.980
So in China, Chinese
government is highly

00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:17.050
supportive on AI startups.

00:18:17.050 --> 00:18:20.680
They give a lot of data to
startups like SenseTime.

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:25.240
So by working with government,
these big AI unicorns

00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:29.890
can access more data, and they
can also get big contracts

00:18:29.890 --> 00:18:31.610
from Chinese governments.

00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:35.205
So this what drives the high
growth of these companies.

00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:41.560
I want to just talk a
little bit about B2C space

00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:44.930
in China, where you can
access much more data.

00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:48.200
If you look at this
curve, in China,

00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:53.180
there's three times active
mobile devices than the US.

00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:55.760
And the number of
food delivery orders

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:58.330
is much more, like
10 times in the US.

00:18:58.330 --> 00:19:00.380
But this is in 2017.

00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:03.290
I think today, US has
more food delivery.

00:19:03.290 --> 00:19:08.150
You see DoorDash, Postmates, all
kind of delivering companies.

00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:15.170
And also, the mobile payments in
China is 50 times than the US.

00:19:15.170 --> 00:19:19.070
So you can get access to
these consumer-based data

00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:20.780
fairly easily.

00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:22.710
And you know AI is
building on data.

00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:25.220
So this is key.

00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:27.530
Let me give you some example.

00:19:27.530 --> 00:19:33.090
One example in B2B industry is
robotics process automation,

00:19:33.090 --> 00:19:40.760
where AI can automating large
amount of repetitive works.

00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:43.670
The typical example is UiPath.

00:19:43.670 --> 00:19:47.050
This company raised
about $500 million.

00:19:47.050 --> 00:19:50.450
Their revenue grow from
$1 million to $100 million

00:19:50.450 --> 00:19:52.800
within only 21 months.

00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:56.060
You can see that US enterprise
are paying a lot of money

00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:57.890
for these type of company.

00:19:57.890 --> 00:20:02.510
And it has over 2,000
enterprise customers globally.

00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:11.900
So another B2B space
is cybersecurity.

00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:14.620
US enterprises
paying a lot of money

00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:17.110
for cybersecurity
companies to using

00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:22.900
AI to help them to detect
and defend these attacks.

00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:31.550
One company, CrowdStrike, they
raised around $500 million.

00:20:31.550 --> 00:20:35.590
They actually analyze a
trillion events per week.

00:20:35.590 --> 00:20:41.620
And it prevent about
30,000 breaches per year.

00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:44.910
Very significant.

00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:49.550
Another example is agriculture,
where the company Plenty, they

00:20:49.550 --> 00:20:57.020
can do over 300 times crop
yield than traditional farms,

00:20:57.020 --> 00:20:59.790
and only using 1% of water.

00:20:59.790 --> 00:21:03.050
So you can see AI plays
a significant role here,

00:21:03.050 --> 00:21:07.240
in terms of improving
the efficiency.

00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:10.540
Let's look at some example
the B2C space, where

00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:12.580
Chinese startups is stronger.

00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:14.590
Entertainment is one example.

00:21:14.590 --> 00:21:17.490
You can use AI to
do personalization,

00:21:17.490 --> 00:21:20.890
using AI to do intelligent
recommendation.

00:21:20.890 --> 00:21:25.550
ByteDance is a good
example, as I mentioned.

00:21:25.550 --> 00:21:29.820
Another industry,
service robotics.

00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:33.560
Companies like UBTech are
producing this all kinds

00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:38.360
of robotics to serve people,
to interact with people, where

00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:41.960
AI plays an important role
of perceiving the environment

00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:43.250
and interact with people.

00:21:45.770 --> 00:21:51.590
A good example of B2G is
the physical security space,

00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:55.130
where Chinese government
is highly supportive

00:21:55.130 --> 00:21:58.790
and give big
contracts to startups.

00:21:58.790 --> 00:22:00.350
Let's look at some number.

00:22:00.350 --> 00:22:06.240
In China, 170 million
security cameras are deployed,

00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:08.840
and you can expect
400 million more.

00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:13.940
So there's way more number of
security cameras than the US.

00:22:13.940 --> 00:22:17.300
SenseTime is the
leader in the space,

00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:20.540
but you also notice other
competitors from China--

00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:23.590
FaceTime, CloudWork,
[INAUDIBLE],,

00:22:23.590 --> 00:22:26.420
all raised big amount of money.

00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:30.350
So the B2G space
in China actually

00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:31.670
attracts a lot of capital.

00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:39.140
I also want to mention that
B2B space in China is booming.

00:22:39.140 --> 00:22:42.860
Although you see that US is
stronger in B2B, but now,

00:22:42.860 --> 00:22:46.080
Chinese companies are paying
more attention to the space.

00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:46.710
Why is that?

00:22:46.710 --> 00:22:50.180
Because the labor costs
is increasing, because

00:22:50.180 --> 00:22:52.430
of the aging population.

00:22:52.430 --> 00:22:57.650
Now enterprises in China are
paying more attention to cost.

00:22:57.650 --> 00:23:04.250
Secondly, the high growth
of mobile internet users,

00:23:04.250 --> 00:23:06.120
the growth rate is diminishing.

00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:10.850
Now Chinese companies are
looking at B2B space more,

00:23:10.850 --> 00:23:15.530
because you couldn't have such
big growth in B2C anymore,

00:23:15.530 --> 00:23:16.460
for most field.

00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:20.420
We can see some example.

00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:25.100
For example, UBTech, they are
building intelligent inspection

00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:30.320
robots that can patrol
and find safety risks.

00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:33.380
SenseTime is also
doing remote sensing.

00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:35.420
They work on satellite data.

00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:37.390
They attract
insights of the data,

00:23:37.390 --> 00:23:43.700
then can apply to
industries like agriculture.

00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:46.060
Now, the takeaway
for the US startups

00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:49.450
is that if you are doing
something in B2B space,

00:23:49.450 --> 00:23:53.250
it's huge opportunity to
expand that to China market.

00:23:56.100 --> 00:23:59.130
One example is DataVisor.

00:23:59.130 --> 00:24:02.460
It's a US company
backed by Sequoia.

00:24:02.460 --> 00:24:06.270
They actually serving a
lot of customers in the US,

00:24:06.270 --> 00:24:07.990
but also in China.

00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:11.730
You can see customers
like Alibaba, Jingdong,

00:24:11.730 --> 00:24:15.600
and some other social apps,
big social apps, in China.

00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:21.640
They started in the US, but now
they expand heavily in China.

00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:25.570
Another takeaway is that if
you are working on B2C or B2G

00:24:25.570 --> 00:24:29.760
space, actually you can learn
a lot from China's practice,

00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:32.790
because Chinese
startups have tried

00:24:32.790 --> 00:24:34.980
really hard in these spaces.

00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:39.600
Because B2B is tougher, they
tried harder in B2C and B2G.

00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:44.370
And they have explored various
possibilities in these spaces.

00:24:47.020 --> 00:24:48.570
Let's look at some example.

00:24:48.570 --> 00:24:54.120
Facial recognition-- you can
see that facial recognition

00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:59.070
technologies in China have
been applied to every industry

00:24:59.070 --> 00:25:04.230
you can imagine, from
education, finance, health care,

00:25:04.230 --> 00:25:07.380
entertainment, auto, security.

00:25:07.380 --> 00:25:10.380
Many industries here.

00:25:10.380 --> 00:25:13.550
You can imagine it's
way more ahead of US.

00:25:16.150 --> 00:25:19.740
Another interesting example
is license plate recognition.

00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:23.170
You can think this as a
easier computer vision task

00:25:23.170 --> 00:25:25.840
to recognize the license
plate in your car.

00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:30.040
Now, in China, many shopping
malls have these systems.

00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:32.750
These systems will
recognize your license plate

00:25:32.750 --> 00:25:34.840
when you get into the
parking structure.

00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:37.450
And when you get out,
it will automatically

00:25:37.450 --> 00:25:41.970
count how much time you spent,
and you will pay for it.

00:25:41.970 --> 00:25:43.900
No ticket needed.

00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:49.150
And it improves the whole
traffic flow significantly.

00:25:49.150 --> 00:25:52.030
So these systems are
broadly used in China now,

00:25:52.030 --> 00:25:53.920
but it's still early in the US.

00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:57.850
So for startups in the
US, it's good to look

00:25:57.850 --> 00:25:59.710
at some applications in China.

00:25:59.710 --> 00:26:04.700
Maybe some of them, you
can apply to the US too.

00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:09.260
Another example is the
physical security space.

00:26:09.260 --> 00:26:11.220
I mentioned this
company we invested,

00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:13.520
they are doing security robots.

00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:17.420
They actually learned a lot
from the B2G space in China.

00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:21.650
These security robots will
patrol in office spaces

00:26:21.650 --> 00:26:24.560
during off hours.

00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:26.390
They will do human detection.

00:26:26.390 --> 00:26:29.660
They will not do
facial recognition,

00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:33.680
because people will have less
concern about their privacy.

00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:35.960
But they will detect
humans and see

00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:39.590
if there is some safety risks.

00:26:39.590 --> 00:26:43.120
They will also collaborate with
the security guards in the US,

00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:46.340
so that if there is
some risk discovered,

00:26:46.340 --> 00:26:50.120
the robot will collaborate with
guards to resolve these risks.

00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:56.280
Now, the fourth
observation we have

00:26:56.280 --> 00:27:03.560
is that Chinese unicorns adopt
some unique growth strategies.

00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:07.010
One strategy is the
horizontal expansion.

00:27:07.010 --> 00:27:10.000
In China, there
are some unicorns

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:14.550
apply the core AI technologies
to multiple industries.

00:27:14.550 --> 00:27:15.920
SenseTime is one example.

00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:18.920
They applying their
computer vision technology

00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:22.290
to over 10 industries.

00:27:22.290 --> 00:27:25.460
And also, SenseTime
sets up its corporate VC

00:27:25.460 --> 00:27:28.640
to invest into other
strategic partners.

00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:31.940
They invest companies doing
entertainment, companies

00:27:31.940 --> 00:27:34.280
doing AI with health
care, companies

00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:36.720
doing AI with smart cities.

00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:41.300
So SenseTime is actually doing
this horizontal expansion

00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:44.920
to speed up its whole growth.

00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:46.880
There's a number of
other AI unicorns

00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:49.190
in China doing similar stuff.

00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:54.410
Well, we notice that for
most AI unicorns in the US,

00:27:54.410 --> 00:27:56.390
they're mainly
focusing on a vertical,

00:27:56.390 --> 00:27:59.360
because they think it's
more capital-efficient.

00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:01.760
We think the
horizontal expansion

00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:04.580
can be applied to some
US AI startups too,

00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:08.110
but not all of them.

00:28:08.110 --> 00:28:10.560
The second interesting
strategy in China

00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:13.870
is called multiple
revenue streams.

00:28:13.870 --> 00:28:19.470
AI startups in China, they
will provide freemium models

00:28:19.470 --> 00:28:22.080
for early adopters.

00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:25.350
But how they make
money if this is free?

00:28:25.350 --> 00:28:27.660
They can get revenues
from other streams.

00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:31.530
Let's look at this license plate
recognition system as example.

00:28:31.530 --> 00:28:35.050
So in China, when these
companies build these systems,

00:28:35.050 --> 00:28:39.600
it's hard for them to sell to
these shopping mall owners,

00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:41.850
because shopping
mall owners don't

00:28:41.850 --> 00:28:43.440
want to pay much for that.

00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:45.900
They say, oh, I don't
need you to pay anything.

00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:49.560
I will give it to you for free.

00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:54.880
But in exchange, let me put
some ads in the entrance.

00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:57.670
Now they sell the
ads, advertisements,

00:28:57.670 --> 00:29:00.130
to other companies,
to make money.

00:29:00.130 --> 00:29:02.490
By doing so, it
covers their cost.

00:29:02.490 --> 00:29:05.260
But later on, when more
and more shopping malls

00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:08.080
have their systems,
it's easier for them

00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:10.730
to sell to many
other shopping malls.

00:29:10.730 --> 00:29:15.310
So actually, this is similar to
the B2C growth strategy, where

00:29:15.310 --> 00:29:19.090
Google provide free
services for consumers,

00:29:19.090 --> 00:29:21.890
so that the adoption
can be much faster.

00:29:21.890 --> 00:29:25.000
So Chinese unicorns
actually applying

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:27.820
this interesting growth
strategy in B2C space

00:29:27.820 --> 00:29:31.390
to B2B, because B2B
in China is so hard,

00:29:31.390 --> 00:29:35.890
they need to think clever ways
to get into the B2C space,

00:29:35.890 --> 00:29:37.450
to accelerate the adoption.

00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:45.840
So why they try these
kind of growth strategies?

00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:49.500
As I said, B2B is
tougher in China.

00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:51.630
Customer adoption
is slow, so they

00:29:51.630 --> 00:29:56.860
need to expand to multiple
industries as soon as possible.

00:29:56.860 --> 00:29:59.430
Secondly, there's
growth pressure

00:29:59.430 --> 00:30:01.420
from investors in China.

00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:05.880
So in China, investors used
to seek B2C growth, which

00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:11.520
is more like exponential growth,
where in B2B space is harder.

00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:14.100
So you needed to expand
to multiple industries

00:30:14.100 --> 00:30:17.580
to achieve faster growth.

00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:19.680
And thirdly, there's
high pressure

00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:22.680
from the fierce
competition in China.

00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:26.880
So SenseTime is actually
competing with these companies

00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:29.180
in a lot of industries.

00:30:29.180 --> 00:30:32.770
These companies all raised
huge amount of money.

00:30:32.770 --> 00:30:34.980
So the competition
is really high.

00:30:34.980 --> 00:30:39.870
So these companies will try to
get into different industries

00:30:39.870 --> 00:30:44.500
faster than competitors.

00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:47.210
Now, the takeaway
for US startups

00:30:47.210 --> 00:30:51.860
is that for some startups, you
can try horizontal expansion.

00:30:51.860 --> 00:30:55.340
If you have a core technology,
and this technology

00:30:55.340 --> 00:30:58.010
can be applied to
multiple industries,

00:30:58.010 --> 00:31:00.680
you may try this kind
of growth strategy.

00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:04.400
Some examples, like
self-driving technology,

00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:08.090
you can apply to auto;
retail; security,

00:31:08.090 --> 00:31:11.600
if you do security robots;
supply chain management, if you

00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:15.070
can do robots in warehouses.

00:31:15.070 --> 00:31:20.240
For robotic process automation,
and also for fraud detection,

00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:23.570
you can try similar
strategy, because it can

00:31:23.570 --> 00:31:27.550
be applied to many industries.

00:31:27.550 --> 00:31:31.180
Secondly, the takeaway
on the multiple revenue

00:31:31.180 --> 00:31:35.890
streams, I think US B2B startups
can think of other revenue

00:31:35.890 --> 00:31:40.910
stream than just a customer
subscribe your services.

00:31:40.910 --> 00:31:44.530
This actually can speed
up the customer adoption.

00:31:44.530 --> 00:31:47.050
If you apply this
strategy in the US,

00:31:47.050 --> 00:31:50.380
maybe you can go much faster
than your competitors.

00:31:53.450 --> 00:31:56.390
So lastly, I want to talk
about some opportunities

00:31:56.390 --> 00:31:58.700
for US startups.

00:31:58.700 --> 00:32:01.970
So first, you can get
into more markets--

00:32:01.970 --> 00:32:06.480
as I mentioned, China and
other emerging markets.

00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:11.100
So secondly, US startups can
learn from China's practices,

00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:15.220
especially in B2C
and B2G spaces.

00:32:15.220 --> 00:32:19.420
Thirdly, it's interesting to
looking at industries with less

00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:23.170
competition, so there are
more opportunities for people

00:32:23.170 --> 00:32:26.080
to start new AI startups.

00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:31.360
Fourthly, companies should
leverage some new tech trends

00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:32.160
in AI.

00:32:36.390 --> 00:32:39.930
So for the third
opportunity, startups

00:32:39.930 --> 00:32:43.480
can step into industries
with less competition.

00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:45.630
So we probe the numbers.

00:32:45.630 --> 00:32:48.240
We find that for
certain industries,

00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:50.230
there's high capital
concentration,

00:32:50.230 --> 00:32:54.060
meaning startups already
raised large rounds of capital.

00:32:54.060 --> 00:32:56.100
So the competition can be high.

00:32:56.100 --> 00:33:00.210
But for new startups, it's
good to look at some industries

00:33:00.210 --> 00:33:02.160
with less competition--

00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:06.510
for example, education, travel,
energy, retail, space tech,

00:33:06.510 --> 00:33:09.700
agriculture, materials,
and many others.

00:33:09.700 --> 00:33:12.930
So in these spaces,
no company actually

00:33:12.930 --> 00:33:16.740
raised huge round of capital.

00:33:16.740 --> 00:33:19.900
So it's easier for
startups to get into.

00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:21.490
There's less competition.

00:33:21.490 --> 00:33:27.130
So maybe it's good to pay
attention to these industries.

00:33:27.130 --> 00:33:30.750
So the fourth opportunity is
to look at the new technology

00:33:30.750 --> 00:33:32.670
trends in AI.

00:33:32.670 --> 00:33:35.720
I briefly summarized
into three categories.

00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:38.800
One is for data
processing, AIoT--

00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:42.780
AI plus IoT-- edge
computing, 5G.

00:33:42.780 --> 00:33:47.340
These technology all allow
more real-time processing

00:33:47.340 --> 00:33:51.840
of large volume of data.

00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:54.660
Second category is
computing power.

00:33:54.660 --> 00:33:58.160
For example, tensor
processing unit, TPU,

00:33:58.160 --> 00:33:59.760
is powered by Google.

00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:02.760
I think it's a good
technology to leverage,

00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:05.490
to speed up the
whole AI computation.

00:34:05.490 --> 00:34:08.110
Quantum computing is on the way.

00:34:08.110 --> 00:34:11.429
We may still need to wait
a few years before it

00:34:11.429 --> 00:34:13.750
gets more better developed.

00:34:13.750 --> 00:34:15.860
But it's promising.

00:34:15.860 --> 00:34:19.260
The third category is
the new algorithms.

00:34:19.260 --> 00:34:21.330
Again, as one
example, you can use

00:34:21.330 --> 00:34:25.679
it to generate very
real fake images.

00:34:25.679 --> 00:34:27.469
For example, some
companies are using

00:34:27.469 --> 00:34:32.400
GAN to generate faked
training data for AI systems.

00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:34.239
You don't need to
get a lot of data.

00:34:34.239 --> 00:34:38.400
Now you can use an algorithm
to generate more training data.

00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:40.710
Some companies are
thinking of applying

00:34:40.710 --> 00:34:44.429
GAN to do some creation work.

00:34:44.429 --> 00:34:47.699
Transfer learning, where
you apply your AI technology

00:34:47.699 --> 00:34:50.250
from one industry
to others, you can

00:34:50.250 --> 00:34:52.070
transfer some
knowledge you already

00:34:52.070 --> 00:34:53.969
learned in one industry.

00:34:53.969 --> 00:34:58.770
If you also expand your system
from one country to others,

00:34:58.770 --> 00:35:02.890
transfer learning
can be also helpful.

00:35:02.890 --> 00:35:07.050
Federated learning-- you
can do collaborative machine

00:35:07.050 --> 00:35:10.470
learning without
centralized training data.

00:35:10.470 --> 00:35:13.530
You can do more like
distributed computing

00:35:13.530 --> 00:35:14.800
when training a large system.

00:35:17.780 --> 00:35:18.460
OK.

00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:23.990
To summarize, today I shared
with you four key observations.

00:35:23.990 --> 00:35:27.880
First, in R&amp;D, US
is ahead of China.

00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:30.700
Secondly, for
manufacturing, China

00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:35.350
has some advantages that
US company can leverage.

00:35:35.350 --> 00:35:39.130
Thirdly, B2B, US
is ahead of China.

00:35:39.130 --> 00:35:43.540
But in B2C and B2G,
Chinese companies

00:35:43.540 --> 00:35:45.320
are actually very strong.

00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:49.480
So it's good for B2B companies
here to expand to China.

00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:53.440
And also, for B2C
and B2G industries,

00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:57.500
US startups can learn
from China's success.

00:35:57.500 --> 00:36:00.430
The fourth observation
is Chinese unicorns

00:36:00.430 --> 00:36:03.520
adopt unique growth strategies.

00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:06.610
I think for most
startup in the US,

00:36:06.610 --> 00:36:10.690
maybe you could learn something
from China's growth strategies,

00:36:10.690 --> 00:36:14.791
so that you can get
faster customer adoption.

00:36:14.791 --> 00:36:17.360
And opportunities for
the US companies--

00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:20.400
first, go into more markets.

00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:24.170
Secondly, you can learn
from China's practices.

00:36:24.170 --> 00:36:28.190
Thirdly, get into industries
with less competition.

00:36:28.190 --> 00:36:32.930
I think there is a huge
amount of opportunities

00:36:32.930 --> 00:36:35.290
for AI startups to do.

00:36:35.290 --> 00:36:38.330
You can solve big problems
in these industries

00:36:38.330 --> 00:36:40.080
with less competition.

00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:43.610
Lastly, pay attention to
these new tech trends,

00:36:43.610 --> 00:36:46.010
and you can leverage
some of the technology

00:36:46.010 --> 00:36:51.480
to build your unicorn
in the future.

00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:52.850
Thank you, everyone.

00:36:52.850 --> 00:36:55.900
