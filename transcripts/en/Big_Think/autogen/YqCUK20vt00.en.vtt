which has my equation on it however my

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:30.509
which has my equation on it however my
 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:33.829
which has my equation on it however my
equation is not the final word because

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:33.839
equation is not the final word because

first of all are five different string

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:36.150
first of all are five different string
 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:37.610
first of all are five different string
theories so there are five different

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620
theories so there are five different
 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.700
theories so there are five different
1-inch equations for each of our in

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710
1-inch equations for each of our in
 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.369
1-inch equations for each of our in
string theories and now and now we have

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379
string theories and now and now we have
 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.950
string theories and now and now we have
something called m-theory a theory of

and we are clueless absolutely clueless

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690
and we are clueless absolutely clueless
 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.330

that may make up dark matter but there's

in this parallel universe it would be

in this parallel universe it would be
 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.160
in this parallel universe it would be
invisible because light would move

but gravity seeps between galaxies

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120
but gravity seeps between galaxies
 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.100
but gravity seeps between galaxies
therefore you would feel as

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110
therefore you would feel as
 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:54.410
therefore you would feel as
gravitational effects but it would be

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420
gravitational effects but it would be
 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.580

we have already discovered dark matter
