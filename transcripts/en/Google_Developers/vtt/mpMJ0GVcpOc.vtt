MARTIN: Hello, my
name is Martin.

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:05.460
MICHAEL: And my name
is Michael.

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:06.710
And we co-founded Ubilabs.

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.260
MICHAEL: I would like to show
you a brief overview of some

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.200
projects we did in the
last few months

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.300
with Google Maps API.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.360
So the first one is for Deutsche
Telekom, one of the

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.100
biggest telecom companies
in Germany.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.590
They wanted to do a map showing
all the subsidiaries

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:32.060
and companies they
own worldwide.

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:36.050
The special thing about this map
is and how we used Styled

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.690
Maps feature to integrate this
Maps features perfectly into

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.680
their CI and into
their website.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.400
The map is full-screen in the
background of the website.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.840
All elements are floating
on top of the map.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.730
Of course, you can click for
more information on the

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.230
subsidiaries and on
the locations.

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:55.530
The other project I would
like to show you is

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.190
Leerstandsmelder, a website
showing vacant buildings in

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.410
the city of Hamburg.

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.580
We have the situation here
that we have a surplus of

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:07.330
commercial real estate and a
real shortage of residential

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:08.290
real estate.

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.820
And with this website, we wanted
to track or to show

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.670
this problem in the
city of Hamburg.

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.240
The users of the website can
contribute by putting listings

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.840
and photos on the map of these
buildings they find the city.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.500
And our goal is to maybe
change this policy when

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.050
government officials or citizens
see it on the map.

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:30.300
Thank you for watching.

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.100
MARTIN: One thing I like about
the Google Maps API is the

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.634
amount of features you have.

00:01:40.634 --> 00:01:44.280
MICHAEL: What I like about the
Google Maps API is to connect

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.160
the real world and the
digital world.
