also have to be careful there are some
cherries that are much better at it

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090
cherries that are much better at it
 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.580
cherries that are much better at it
there are some cherries that are scams

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590
there are some cherries that are scams
 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.860

what you want to do for us we were
 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.930
what you want to do for us we were
saying okay I think that a lot of

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940

outside of the building that's that's
 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:19.999
outside of the building that's that's
all well and good especially when it

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009
all well and good especially when it
 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.830

the poor I mean that is what the essence

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400
the poor I mean that is what the essence
 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.429
the poor I mean that is what the essence
is of charities to help people who are

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439
is of charities to help people who are
 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.929
is of charities to help people who are
underprivileged a surprising amount of

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:34.939
underprivileged a surprising amount of
 

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:37.490
underprivileged a surprising amount of
philanthropic dollars don't go to the

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500
philanthropic dollars don't go to the
 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.100
philanthropic dollars don't go to the
needy even in higher ed there was a

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110
needy even in higher ed there was a
 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.359
needy even in higher ed there was a
study done by the Indiana Center for

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369
study done by the Indiana Center for
 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.300
study done by the Indiana Center for
philanthropy that found that only a

philanthropy that found that only a
 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.460
philanthropy that found that only a
small portion less than fifty percent

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470
small portion less than fifty percent
 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:50.630
small portion less than fifty percent
far less and fifty percent actually

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640
far less and fifty percent actually
 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.630
far less and fifty percent actually
ended up helping poor students who

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640
ended up helping poor students who
 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.249
ended up helping poor students who
couldn't afford to go to college now

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259
couldn't afford to go to college now
 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.969
couldn't afford to go to college now
it's not by intent it's just that we

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979
it's not by intent it's just that we
 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.709
it's not by intent it's just that we
need to become more efficient this

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719
need to become more efficient this
 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.270
need to become more efficient this
industry needs to become a lot more

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280
industry needs to become a lot more
 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.300
industry needs to become a lot more
efficient and needs to target much more

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310
efficient and needs to target much more
 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.070
efficient and needs to target much more
clearly the needy altruism actually is a

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080
clearly the needy altruism actually is a
 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.380
clearly the needy altruism actually is a
very interesting phenomenon so we

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390
very interesting phenomenon so we
 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.370
very interesting phenomenon so we
actually

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380
actually
 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.190
actually
think that when we give we're losing

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200
think that when we give we're losing
 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.170
think that when we give we're losing
something we're giving some of our money

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180
something we're giving some of our money

our time or resources to someone else it
turns out when that neuro scientists who

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720
turns out when that neuro scientists who
 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.230
turns out when that neuro scientists who
have studied altruism they found some

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240
have studied altruism they found some
 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.210

stimulate a part of the brain it lights
 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.070
stimulate a part of the brain it lights
up this part of the brain and that part

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080
up this part of the brain and that part
 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.140
up this part of the brain and that part
is very similar to the same part of the

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150
is very similar to the same part of the
 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.550
is very similar to the same part of the
brain that is stimulated when you engage

area and in half of research subjects it

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570
area and in half of research subjects it
 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.680
area and in half of research subjects it
turns out that they're feeling of

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690
turns out that they're feeling of
