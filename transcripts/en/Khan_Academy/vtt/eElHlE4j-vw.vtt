00:00:00.463 --> 00:00:01.548
What I want to do in this video

00:00:01.548 --> 00:00:07.044
is think a little bit
about the estate tax.

00:00:07.044 --> 00:00:09.063
As the name of the tax implies,

00:00:09.063 --> 00:00:11.468
it is a tax on someone's estate

00:00:11.468 --> 00:00:13.626
or when someone passes away,

00:00:13.626 --> 00:00:16.670
it is a tax on what they
want to leave behind

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:19.009
to whoever they want to leave it to

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:20.673
either in their will or in their family

00:00:20.673 --> 00:00:22.467
or whoever they want to
leave their stuff to.

00:00:22.467 --> 00:00:28.777
Sometimes it's referred
to as an inheritance tax

00:00:28.777 --> 00:00:31.241
and sometimes you'll
hear it talk this ways

00:00:31.241 --> 00:00:32.403
on the news,

00:00:32.403 --> 00:00:34.068
maybe it's a little bit derisive.

00:00:34.068 --> 00:00:38.925
It's called a death tax.

00:00:38.925 --> 00:00:41.814
The general idea, let's say that right now

00:00:41.814 --> 00:00:43.474
my entire net worth,

00:00:43.474 --> 00:00:50.997
I am worth $3 million
and then I pass away.

00:00:50.997 --> 00:00:55.725
This $3 million goes into my estate.

00:00:55.725 --> 00:00:58.258
This is my estate.

00:00:58.258 --> 00:01:00.557
So this $3 million could
be all of my savings,

00:01:00.557 --> 00:01:01.795
could be my stock portfolio,

00:01:01.795 --> 00:01:03.148
it could be the value of my land,

00:01:03.148 --> 00:01:03.790
my real estate.

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:04.535
Everything I own.

00:01:04.535 --> 00:01:05.325
My car.

00:01:05.325 --> 00:01:06.992
Everything combined is worth $3 million.

00:01:06.992 --> 00:01:10.453
It goes into my estate after I pass.

00:01:10.453 --> 00:01:12.982
Let's say I leave everything in my estate

00:01:12.982 --> 00:01:16.791
to my daughter.

00:01:16.791 --> 00:01:20.051
I leave it to my daughter.

00:01:20.051 --> 00:01:24.249
It's at this point that the
estate tax comes into question

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:26.873
of how much money will my daughter get.

00:01:26.873 --> 00:01:28.783
It turns out for $3 million

00:01:28.783 --> 00:01:34.955
my daughter is exempt for
inheritance from an individual.

00:01:34.955 --> 00:01:37.706
The first $5 million are exempt.

00:01:37.706 --> 00:01:41.991
In this situation where I'm
leaving $3 million for my daughter

00:01:41.991 --> 00:01:49.014
she actually will get
the entire $3 million.

00:01:49.014 --> 00:01:50.786
If, let's say I'm even richer than that.

00:01:50.786 --> 00:01:54.112
Let's say that I have $6 million.

00:01:54.112 --> 00:01:55.864
Let's say the scenario
where I have $6 million

00:01:55.864 --> 00:02:01.455
it all goes to my estate after my death

00:02:01.455 --> 00:02:05.274
and now the first $5 million is exempt.

00:02:05.274 --> 00:02:08.857
Let me write my daughter over here.

00:02:08.857 --> 00:02:15.400
My daughter will get the
first 5 million tax free

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.453
and then the increment
above that exemption,

00:02:18.453 --> 00:02:21.331
the increment above what has been excluded

00:02:21.331 --> 00:02:23.921
will then be taxed at a certain rate

00:02:23.921 --> 00:02:25.855
and that rate is constantly changing.

00:02:25.855 --> 00:02:27.251
For the sake of simplicity

00:02:27.251 --> 00:02:29.087
I'm going to go with the 35%

00:02:29.087 --> 00:02:32.229
and that's actually the rate in 2011.

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:33.922
The rest of the 1 million,

00:02:33.922 --> 00:02:41.224
the 1 million taxed at 35%.

00:02:41.224 --> 00:02:45.118
The federal government will
tax 35% of the 1 million.

00:02:45.118 --> 00:02:52.771
They will essentially take
350,000 for themselves

00:02:52.771 --> 00:02:57.386
and my daughter will be
left with 5,650,000, right?

00:02:57.386 --> 00:02:59.654
Because of this million
you'd take out 350,000,

00:02:59.654 --> 00:03:02.636
you have 650,000 left.

00:03:02.636 --> 00:03:14.789
My daughter in this situation
will be left with $5.65 million.

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:17.268
The federal government took 350,000.

00:03:17.268 --> 00:03:23.465
If I am super rich, let's
say that I am worth,

00:03:23.465 --> 00:03:25.004
let me make a number to make the math easy

00:03:25.004 --> 00:03:27.003
so that I don't have to
get a calculator out.

00:03:27.003 --> 00:03:33.759
Let's say that I am worth $1,005,000,000.

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:35.784
This is my net worth.

00:03:35.784 --> 00:03:40.590
In this situation, the first
5 million will be excluded.

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:45.784
My daughter will get
the 5 million directly,

00:03:45.784 --> 00:03:46.752
that will be excluded.

00:03:46.752 --> 00:03:50.844
Then everything above that
will be taxed at the 35%.

00:03:50.844 --> 00:03:55.647
In this situation you have
$1 billion taxed at 35%.

00:03:55.647 --> 00:04:01.514
1 billion at 35%.

00:04:01.514 --> 00:04:06.369
In this scenario the federal government

00:04:06.369 --> 00:04:12.784
will take $350 million

00:04:12.784 --> 00:04:14.712
and so that would leave of this billion

00:04:14.712 --> 00:04:18.287
650 million left my daughter.

00:04:18.287 --> 00:04:20.957
In total, she would get this 650 million

00:04:20.957 --> 00:04:23.536
plus the 5 million that was excluded.

00:04:23.536 --> 00:04:29.253
She would end up with a
total of $655 million.

00:04:29.253 --> 00:04:30.713
I wouldn't feel too bad for her,

00:04:30.713 --> 00:04:32.652
she should be pretty okay.

00:04:32.652 --> 00:04:34.714
That's just how the estate tax works

00:04:34.714 --> 00:04:37.715
and these examples I
gave with the 5 million

00:04:37.715 --> 00:04:38.714
that is excluded,

00:04:38.714 --> 00:04:42.203
this is for an individual
when they pass away.

00:04:42.203 --> 00:04:43.718
If it's being done as a couple,

00:04:43.718 --> 00:04:46.207
this exemption is actually 10 million.

00:04:46.207 --> 00:04:48.619
Between my wife and I,

00:04:48.619 --> 00:04:51.455
we have $1,005,000,000.

00:04:51.455 --> 00:04:54.951
Let's say I pass away and we
own everything collectively.

00:04:54.951 --> 00:04:58.383
She actually gets the
extra joint exemption

00:04:58.383 --> 00:04:59.319
passed on to her.

00:04:59.319 --> 00:05:01.455
Then if and when she passes away,

00:05:01.455 --> 00:05:05.049
this would be $10 million
that will be tax free.

00:05:05.049 --> 00:05:07.715
In this scenario, if this
is being done as a couple

00:05:07.715 --> 00:05:11.118
my daughter would get
the entire $6 million.

00:05:11.118 --> 00:05:13.847
The interesting thing about the estate tax

00:05:13.847 --> 00:05:14.984
is it's highly contested.

00:05:14.984 --> 00:05:17.052
People always debate, is
it wrong or is it right?

00:05:17.052 --> 00:05:18.792
I'll talk to you on that a little bit.

00:05:18.792 --> 00:05:21.413
I'll let you decide for yourself.

00:05:21.413 --> 00:05:23.642
But I'll give, at least, in what I hear

00:05:23.642 --> 00:05:27.180
is the main arguments for
or against the estate tax.

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:30.584
Like most taxes, there's always someone

00:05:30.584 --> 00:05:33.316
who will believe that it is unfair.

00:05:33.316 --> 00:05:39.957
Let me write the for and against.

00:05:39.957 --> 00:05:42.066
For and against the estate tax.

00:05:42.066 --> 00:05:43.593
Some people say it's unfair,

00:05:43.593 --> 00:05:45.487
"Look. Over the course of my life

00:05:45.487 --> 00:05:46.864
"I earned all of these money.

00:05:46.864 --> 00:05:49.121
"I paid all of these income taxes

00:05:49.121 --> 00:05:50.200
"off of the money I earned

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:53.731
"and now the stuff that I want
to leave behind to my children

00:05:53.731 --> 00:05:58.858
"I am not able to leave it all to them.

00:05:58.858 --> 00:06:02.395
"Because obviously $655
million is not enough.

00:06:02.395 --> 00:06:07.391
"They deserve the entire
$1,005,000,000 for being my child."

00:06:07.391 --> 00:06:12.061
So there's this argument that it is unfair

00:06:12.061 --> 00:06:13.922
or it's some double taxation.

00:06:13.922 --> 00:06:15.995
The money was taxed the
first time it was earned

00:06:15.995 --> 00:06:17.728
and now it's being taxed again

00:06:17.728 --> 00:06:19.256
once it's being inherited.

00:06:19.256 --> 00:06:20.941
The counter argument to that

00:06:20.941 --> 00:06:23.791
is double taxation is
everywhere in our society.

00:06:23.791 --> 00:06:24.946
Corporations pay taxes

00:06:24.946 --> 00:06:26.943
and then they give dividends

00:06:26.943 --> 00:06:29.795
and the stock holders pay taxes again

00:06:29.795 --> 00:06:32.395
and that's an exchange for
having the limited liability

00:06:32.395 --> 00:06:33.462
of the corporation.

00:06:33.462 --> 00:06:35.594
You pay taxes on your income

00:06:35.594 --> 00:06:37.458
and then with that after tax income

00:06:37.458 --> 00:06:39.125
you go buy something at the store,

00:06:39.125 --> 00:06:40.399
once again, you pay sales tax.

00:06:40.399 --> 00:06:43.728
Double taxation, it happens everywhere.

00:06:43.728 --> 00:06:47.051
The for argument and
somewhat the counter argument

00:06:47.051 --> 00:06:49.922
against the unfairness of it all is that,

00:06:49.922 --> 00:06:52.527
"Look. We're exempting,"
depending on how you view it,

00:06:52.527 --> 00:06:56.712
"the first $5 million or $10 million."

00:06:56.712 --> 00:07:01.465
$5 million to $10 million is exempt.

00:07:01.465 --> 00:07:04.534
The person who's for the
estate tax would say look,

00:07:04.534 --> 00:07:05.700
it's a little disingenuous

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:07.871
when you make this
impression that your children

00:07:07.871 --> 00:07:09.209
are going to suffer.

00:07:09.209 --> 00:07:12.034
They're not going to be
able to get your house

00:07:12.034 --> 00:07:13.288
or they're not going to
be able to get your car.

00:07:13.288 --> 00:07:15.869
They're going to be
able to get all of that

00:07:15.869 --> 00:07:19.061
as long as it's worth
less than $10 million

00:07:19.061 --> 00:07:20.621
which is not a small amount of money.

00:07:20.621 --> 00:07:23.951
Even above that, they're going
to get 65% of everything.

00:07:23.951 --> 00:07:26.062
It's not like your children
are going to be left hungry

00:07:26.062 --> 00:07:27.666
because of the estate tax.

00:07:27.666 --> 00:07:29.395
It's actually a very
small number of people

00:07:29.395 --> 00:07:32.451
that the estate tax will
even hit, really, the rich

00:07:32.451 --> 00:07:34.001
because even the upper-middle class,

00:07:34.001 --> 00:07:38.623
very few of them will leave
more than $10 million behind.

00:07:38.623 --> 00:07:39.703
The other argument is,

00:07:39.703 --> 00:07:41.464
if you're going to tax anything.

00:07:41.464 --> 00:07:44.996
What to tax?

00:07:44.996 --> 00:07:46.284
Do you tax income?

00:07:46.284 --> 00:07:48.536
Obviously, you do have to
tax income to some degree

00:07:48.536 --> 00:07:50.394
to get enough revenue for
the federal government.

00:07:50.394 --> 00:07:54.122
Isn't it better to tax someone
who did not work for the money?

00:07:54.122 --> 00:07:56.036
Someone who's getting the money, I mean,

00:07:56.036 --> 00:07:58.201
maybe they already got every
other privilege in life.

00:07:58.201 --> 00:08:00.326
They went to the best
schools and all the rest

00:08:00.326 --> 00:08:01.927
and through connections, maybe, good jobs.

00:08:01.927 --> 00:08:03.465
Why not tax the person

00:08:03.465 --> 00:08:07.698
who is already lucky to
some degree by virtue of,

00:08:07.698 --> 00:08:10.116
and this is just the
argument someone would make.

00:08:10.116 --> 00:08:12.857
By the way, they're sill going
to get a lot of that money.

00:08:12.857 --> 00:08:14.322
It's not like they're
going to be left poor.

00:08:14.322 --> 00:08:15.618
They're still going to be fine.

00:08:15.618 --> 00:08:18.539
To some degree, maybe if
they have a little bit less

00:08:18.539 --> 00:08:21.125
it will be more of an
incentive for them to work.

00:08:21.125 --> 00:08:23.616
The other argument for the estate tax,

00:08:23.616 --> 00:08:27.058
and this is a broader,
almost a macro view of things

00:08:27.058 --> 00:08:29.655
of what might be good for society

00:08:29.655 --> 00:08:31.702
is if you don't have an estate tax

00:08:31.702 --> 00:08:34.287
and we know that there's this
huge fortunes in the world

00:08:34.287 --> 00:08:37.655
where someone creates
a big business empire

00:08:37.655 --> 00:08:39.727
and they have billions
upon billions of dollars.

00:08:39.727 --> 00:08:44.675
If someone has $10 billion,

00:08:44.675 --> 00:08:47.925
and let's say they don't
have that many children

00:08:47.925 --> 00:08:49.053
that they leave it behind to.

00:08:49.053 --> 00:08:50.591
Maybe they only have one child

00:08:50.591 --> 00:08:54.027
and they leave that $10
billion to that one child.

00:08:54.027 --> 00:08:56.658
Then that one child can
literally just let that income

00:08:56.658 --> 00:08:58.061
passively earn interest.

00:08:58.061 --> 00:08:59.875
They'll never have to work
the rest of their life

00:08:59.875 --> 00:09:03.876
and through the passive
earnings of just the assets

00:09:03.876 --> 00:09:04.790
being invested,

00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:06.545
over the course of that child's life

00:09:06.545 --> 00:09:10.938
might grow to $30 billion.

00:09:10.938 --> 00:09:13.289
It will definitely grow faster
than the economy itself.

00:09:13.289 --> 00:09:15.258
Then that child, if
they have no estate tax,

00:09:15.258 --> 00:09:17.994
they'll pass the $30
billion to their children

00:09:17.994 --> 00:09:19.396
and then that will grow.

00:09:19.396 --> 00:09:22.213
What you would have happening
generation after generation

00:09:22.213 --> 00:09:27.057
is this family, if you
say the person who sets up

00:09:27.057 --> 00:09:28.723
the empire.

00:09:28.723 --> 00:09:31.058
Let's say this is the
entire country's GDP.

00:09:31.058 --> 00:09:34.965
Right where the empire sets
up in this person's lifespan,

00:09:34.965 --> 00:09:37.132
this is their proportion of the GDP

00:09:37.132 --> 00:09:38.729
and this is just for simplicity.

00:09:38.729 --> 00:09:42.049
If you don't tax it and just
passively over the course

00:09:42.049 --> 00:09:42.875
of the next lifespan,

00:09:42.875 --> 00:09:48.328
if there aren't enough offspring
to split up this fortune,

00:09:48.328 --> 00:09:52.385
as the GDP grows these
people's investments

00:09:52.385 --> 00:09:55.049
will grow even faster passively.

00:09:55.049 --> 00:09:59.659
Overtime, this family will
grow to own more and more

00:09:59.659 --> 00:10:01.458
of the nation's wealth

00:10:01.458 --> 00:10:03.327
without really having to do anything.

00:10:03.327 --> 00:10:06.214
It almost creates this nobility class

00:10:06.214 --> 00:10:07.874
and obviously that's what,

00:10:07.874 --> 00:10:09.391
at least many people in the United States

00:10:09.391 --> 00:10:11.991
view as what's different about America

00:10:11.991 --> 00:10:15.214
relative to old Europe,
to what used to happen

00:10:15.214 --> 00:10:17.727
in terms of the French revolution,

00:10:17.727 --> 00:10:20.724
and people just inheriting land
generation after generation

00:10:20.724 --> 00:10:22.875
and never having to work.

00:10:22.875 --> 00:10:25.623
This right here is a quote
from Winston Churchill

00:10:25.623 --> 00:10:28.522
on his view of an inheritance tax.

00:10:28.522 --> 00:10:30.374
He viewed it as a certain corrective

00:10:30.374 --> 00:10:35.547
against the development of
a race of the idle rich.

00:10:35.547 --> 00:10:37.327
Anyway, that's the explanation of it.

00:10:37.327 --> 00:10:39.625
You can stand for either side of it

00:10:39.625 --> 00:10:42.133
but hopefully this at
least gives you the tools

00:10:42.133 --> 00:10:46.133
to think about whether
you're for or against it.
