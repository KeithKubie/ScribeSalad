00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.377
Think about all the stuff you
can do on your phone...

00:00:02.377 --> 00:00:03.462
You can get directions

00:00:03.462 --> 00:00:04.463
Translate stuff

00:00:04.463 --> 00:00:05.380
Make movies

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:06.298
You can check your pulse

00:00:06.298 --> 00:00:07.341
Start your car

00:00:07.341 --> 00:00:08.592
See earth from outer space

00:00:08.592 --> 00:00:09.676
Power a satellite.

00:00:09.676 --> 00:00:10.761
No really.

00:00:10.761 --> 00:00:14.097
Your phone has enough power to
put a man on the moon!

00:00:14.097 --> 00:00:16.808
Now, use your phone to
DRAW a moon....

00:00:16.808 --> 00:00:18.018
Exactly.

00:00:18.018 --> 00:00:20.020
Your phone can help you do
anything, fast.

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.106
It just can't help you draw
something simple, fast.

00:00:23.106 --> 00:00:25.192
Think about it, if you're not a
designer and you want to make

00:00:25.192 --> 00:00:27.945
a quick party flyer... where do
you even go for that?

00:00:27.945 --> 00:00:29.321
You probably have to
download some app

00:00:29.321 --> 00:00:31.365
or buy a design program.

00:00:31.365 --> 00:00:33.659
So a few of us at Google
created AutoDraw...

00:00:33.659 --> 00:00:35.702
It's a drawing tool for
the rest of us.

00:00:35.702 --> 00:00:38.413
AutoDraw pairs the magic of
machine learning with drawings

00:00:38.413 --> 00:00:41.583
from talented artists to help
you draw stuff fast.

00:00:41.583 --> 00:00:44.211
Say, you want to make your
friend a poster... for her bday.

00:00:44.211 --> 00:00:46.672
You'd go to the AutoDraw site
from your phone or computer...

00:00:46.672 --> 00:00:47.881
And you'd start
doodling something

00:00:47.881 --> 00:00:49.549
that sorta looks like a cake.

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:51.593
The AutoDraw suggestion tool
then guesses your doodle

00:00:51.593 --> 00:00:54.554
and you pick a cake you like.

00:00:54.554 --> 00:00:56.765
And you can do this with all
kinds of drawings.

00:00:56.765 --> 00:00:57.808
Flowers.

00:00:57.808 --> 00:00:59.059
Dolphins.

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:00.018
Socks.

00:01:00.018 --> 00:01:01.687
Furniture for a new
living room layout.

00:01:01.687 --> 00:01:03.063
A bike for an event poster.

00:01:03.063 --> 00:01:05.857
A giraffe, on a house, in the
sky for no good reason.

00:01:05.857 --> 00:01:07.359
You could make a coloring book.

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:09.820
And your aunt can sketch out
her weird dreams.

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:11.071
You can also draw
without the help

00:01:11.071 --> 00:01:12.864
of the AutoDraw
suggestion tool...

00:01:12.864 --> 00:01:14.241
So you can doodle in meetings.

00:01:14.241 --> 00:01:15.534
Play tic tac toe.

00:01:15.534 --> 00:01:16.910
Sketch a stranger at a bus stop.

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.955
Yada Yada Yada. With AutoDraw
there's nothing to download,

00:01:19.955 --> 00:01:21.123
nothing to buy...

00:01:21.123 --> 00:01:22.874
And it works anywhere.

00:01:22.874 --> 00:01:25.419
It works on your phone, your
computer, your old laptop,

00:01:25.419 --> 00:01:28.672
your new laptop, dusty desktops,
and fancy tablets.

00:01:28.672 --> 00:01:31.008
So no matter who you are or
where you are, with AutoDraw

00:01:31.008 --> 00:01:33.010
you can draw anything, fast.

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:36.013
AutoDraw.
Fast drawing for everyone.

00:01:36.013 --> 00:01:41.018
