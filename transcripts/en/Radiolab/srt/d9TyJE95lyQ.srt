1
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:10,330
You're listening to radiolab from
public radio,W , N, Y, s, t, e,

2
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:11,810
n, n, P, R

3
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:17,320
for Steve Strogatz mathematician
who we sometimes have on the show.

4
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:20,080
It all started with a pendulum.

5
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:26,450
He was sitting in math class. Our
teacher handed us a little toy pendulum.

6
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:29,870
Basically just a little device with a
ball on the end of the string that was

7
00:00:29,871 --> 00:00:31,880
retractable. That is,

8
00:00:31,881 --> 00:00:34,670
you could change the length of
the string like an old telescope,

9
00:00:34,671 --> 00:00:37,940
you know on that the pirate stretches
out of spyglass. Click, click, click.

10
00:00:37,941 --> 00:00:42,140
You could make it longer in discreet
clicks and then the teacher gave us a

11
00:00:42,141 --> 00:00:43,940
stopwatch and said,

12
00:00:43,941 --> 00:00:47,840
I want you to time how long it takes for
this pendulum to swing back and forth

13
00:00:47,841 --> 00:00:50,480
10 times. Okay, so I do the experiment,

14
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:57,500
10 swings, I record how, how many
seconds it took. Then he says,

15
00:00:57,501 --> 00:01:01,640
now make the pendulum a little bit longer.
One click longer, click do it again

16
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,990
and as you might expect since
now the string is longer,

17
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:09,560
it takes a bit more time to make the
10 swings and I write down the number,

18
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:13,850
click do it again, click do it again.

19
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:19,100
And I do this five or six times due to
fleet plotting the the results on graph

20
00:01:19,101 --> 00:01:19,934
paper,

21
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:22,880
which is what the experiment was really
supposed to teach us how to use graph

22
00:01:22,881 --> 00:01:26,720
paper. So he's clicking,
measuring, making little dot.

23
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:30,800
Click measure.click measure dot
soon the thing is filled with dots.

24
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,850
That is when he noticed something,
this spooky thing was happening,

25
00:01:34,851 --> 00:01:39,140
which is that the dots were
falling on an arc on a curve.

26
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:42,320
They weren't on a straight line.
They fell on a particular curve.

27
00:01:42,321 --> 00:01:46,400
And I noticed that this curve was a curve
I had seen before because I had just

28
00:01:46,401 --> 00:01:49,700
learned about it in Algebra
class and it's called a parabola.

29
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:53,660
And this really gave me the creeps.

30
00:01:53,661 --> 00:01:56,690
I had this sort of feeling of the hairs
on the back of my neck standing up

31
00:01:56,691 --> 00:02:00,590
because it was as if this inanimate
thing, this pendulum, new Algebra

32
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:05,600
and my 13 year old mind couldn't
understand that. How could,

33
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:10,060
how could this thing swinging back and
forth know something about parabolas or

34
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:14,000
how could that be built in then? And
even creepier thought occurred to him.

35
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:17,860
Wait a second. This parabola on my paper,

36
00:02:17,861 --> 00:02:22,650
which is the same one as the math book
is also out in the world. It's the,

37
00:02:22,651 --> 00:02:25,060
the shape that water makes
coming out of a water fountain.

38
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,470
It's also the shape of, you know,

39
00:02:26,471 --> 00:02:29,200
when you shoot a rocket into
this guy and it slowly descends.

40
00:02:29,201 --> 00:02:33,250
It's that it was in that moment that I
suddenly understood what people mean when

41
00:02:33,251 --> 00:02:36,490
they say there is a law of nature.

42
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:40,810
Uh,

43
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:45,520
do you remember what it was that meet
your heroes stand on and was it that you

44
00:02:45,521 --> 00:02:48,670
had peaked in and discovered
a secret or did you just sent,

45
00:02:48,671 --> 00:02:52,660
we found the right answer it much closer
to the first thing you said that there

46
00:02:52,661 --> 00:02:55,480
was this sort of veil over reality.

47
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:58,510
A hidden universe that you
couldn't see unless you knew math.

48
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:04,180
It really felt like being led into some
sort of secret society and that wasn't

49
00:03:04,181 --> 00:03:07,630
so much the point. I mean, it's not like
I cared about being in this priesthood.

50
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,140
It was, it's a very
intimate, personal thing.

51
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:16,090
This feeling of wonder of a sense of
living in an comprehensible and beautiful

52
00:03:16,091 --> 00:03:16,924
universe

53
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:19,983
[inaudible]

54
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:23,480
go partly comprehensible. That's the
beauty of it. I mean, if you're a lobster,

55
00:03:23,481 --> 00:03:25,460
you don't have this thought, right?

56
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,920
And lobster doesn't get to
think about the laws of nature.

57
00:03:27,921 --> 00:03:32,750
And so I've often thought to myself
that it's a blessing that we live in a

58
00:03:32,751 --> 00:03:36,620
certain window of intelligence, that
if we were infinitely smart, godlike,

59
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:41,180
we'd have such powerful brains, we could
see every implication of everything.

60
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:44,540
So math wouldn't be fun for
an a being that's too smart.

61
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:47,540
And of course for the lobster
that's not smart enough,

62
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:49,070
math is no fun for them either.

63
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:54,430
It's in this intermediate window where
math and science become something to

64
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:55,484
rejoice in.

65
00:03:56,930 --> 00:04:01,820
Today's program is about kind of
search search for order for patterns,

66
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,320
hidden truth in truth,

67
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:07,100
and it's about the scientists who go out
looking for those things and sometimes

68
00:04:07,101 --> 00:04:10,910
find them, oh, what's
that? And sometimes don't,

69
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:13,250
I felt humiliated. I felt stupid.

70
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:17,420
Question is what makes these people
tick? And we're calling this show,

71
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:21,620
why do I love the fly
that's eating my brain?

72
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:25,430
That'll make sense later. I'm Jad
Abumrad. Hi, I'm Robert Krulwich.

73
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:26,360
This is radio lab.

74
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:35,180
Okay, you ready? Yeah. Off we go.

75
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:40,330
I think there's always been a desire
to somehow categorize and classify the

76
00:04:41,241 --> 00:04:42,440
world around us.

77
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,380
I remember it and when you were in,

78
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:49,570
I don't know when it would be
like in eighth grade when they,

79
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:53,380
when the teacher comes in in general
science and he pulls down the periodic

80
00:04:53,381 --> 00:04:55,630
table of elements or that. Yeah, sure.

81
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,750
I mean that was one of the first
times where I was like, yeah,

82
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:01,030
I don't want to be a
scientist. It's not for me.

83
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:05,190
But for kids who love this kind of thing,
take Oliver sacks for example. Yeah.

84
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:07,500
Chad, you should come in.
I should come in. Yeah.

85
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,900
So a couple of years ago we had went to
talk to Oliver sacks about something.

86
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:11,280
Well,

87
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,450
it's actually mostly you that was going
to talk to them and I was just tagging

88
00:05:13,451 --> 00:05:17,230
along for the hell of it. Yup. And for
some reason we ended up in his bathroom.

89
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:20,890
I tend to read it for this and that,
maybe to look in a book or something.

90
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:26,020
He seems to have facts and figures in his
as well. There's a lot of us in there.

91
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:26,863
I'm sorry. Sorry.

92
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:30,610
And that's when we noticed you have
a periodic chart in the bathroom,

93
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,920
but he had a periodic Cuba, the
elements on the wall in the bathroom.

94
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:40,120
Here we are. Wow. How funny. Periodic
table in the bathroom. But then he said,

95
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:41,830
well, you know, if you
go out into the couch,

96
00:05:41,831 --> 00:05:46,510
you'll see type of cushion cushions
employed with the periodic table.

97
00:05:46,511 --> 00:05:47,980
And then he took us to his bedroom.

98
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:51,490
Although I don't usually take people
into my bedroom. Oh, he'll come where?

99
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,830
He showed us his periodic
table, comforter.

100
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,490
I tend to sleep here right under tungsten.

101
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:03,980
But the cool part was when he took us to
the living room where you had this, uh,

102
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:08,270
describe what isn't before us here. And
I'm like an Walter, it's like a little,

103
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,310
a little dictionary Stan on top of,

104
00:06:10,311 --> 00:06:14,960
which was a beautiful mahogany
box, a fine wooden box,

105
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:16,520
like the size of a backgammon set,

106
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:20,070
core periodic table of the
elements is a very fine wooden box.

107
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:24,190
And if you care to open it all
right? It's, it's, it's uh,

108
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:29,810
it's made of some sort of fine wood
if it comes from Russia. All right.

109
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,040
Is there a trick to opening this? Oh,

110
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:40,100
[inaudible] okay. We've all seen the
periodic table of being Alona chart,

111
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:44,900
but I don't know the phrase box
there. There were the shovel elements.

112
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:49,620
These are all these and we have
here like 90, some odd little, uh,

113
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:53,690
little tubes, little solid UDL TV files.

114
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:56,810
Almost all the elements.
We'll have arsenic this myth

115
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,350
[inaudible] manganese, Merck can
nitrogenic molybdenum goal. Since I am,

116
00:07:03,351 --> 00:07:03,861
for example,

117
00:07:03,861 --> 00:07:08,861
having my 77th birthday tomorrow
and element 72 is half Niamh.

118
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,980
There is a little half a
million, a little rocks.

119
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,550
Here's what they're, what they
sound like. If he's grabbing me,

120
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:18,410
I have coming to me,

121
00:07:18,411 --> 00:07:22,460
I hope it lives today and in got of
half Hafnum which will be very much more

122
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,193
satisfying.

123
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:26,870
What would you do with an in gap that
you can't do with the two little pebbles?

124
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:29,330
Uh, I'll be able to hold it in my hand.

125
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:34,180
I first love of chemistry had to do
with the, the said she wants a year.

126
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:39,020
We, one of the liquid elements
me, I loved the colors around me.

127
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:44,540
Lee Brown fluid, Ethan Luster, Pale
Golden. That can be very, very beautiful.

128
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:49,170
The, the physical properties is a gas
trapped in a little vial. Yes. I wasn't,

129
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:51,940
the one wouldn't want to
drop that. Why not? I will,

130
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:55,120
it's just not good to [inaudible] can
I just jump in here for a second? Sure.

131
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,770
Um, cause I, I, I really need to jump.

132
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:02,360
But the thing that's really crazy about
that box and this you don't get from,

133
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:06,230
uh, from looking at a period of chart
on a wall, is that all those elements,

134
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:11,210
Boolean Bull, carbon, nitrogen,
that's like the world.

135
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:16,100
I mean everything that we can see
and perceive. This table right here,

136
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:20,240
the depth in my mouth, sky
though ocean, the mountains,

137
00:08:20,241 --> 00:08:23,540
it's all need of some
combination of elements.

138
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:28,090
That box and the box itself
gives it all in deep,

139
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:29,560
deep order.

140
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,910
I had noticed myself,

141
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:40,180
I can't help noticing that the elements
are organized in a very special sort of

142
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:46,430
way. For example, excuse me for
I have managed to not notice.

143
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:50,270
I find it a little odd that
you could organize them at all.

144
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:55,040
I don't even know how to begin the
process of figuring out they're related in

145
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:58,100
well, well then then you are sort of um,

146
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:03,270
recapitulating what you know, what
everyone felt in the, in the early days,

147
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:07,200
of course in the really early days people
thought they were just four elements.

148
00:09:07,201 --> 00:09:11,250
The ancient notion of elements
took the form of earth,

149
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:15,150
fire and water.

150
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:21,090
Basically the thought that the whole
world could be composed of these four

151
00:09:21,091 --> 00:09:24,540
ingredients in different ways.
But then in the 18th century,

152
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:25,500
we're skipping ahead a bit.

153
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:30,690
Chemists began to break things down into
smaller pieces like wind became gases

154
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:34,410
like oxygen and hydrogen and nitrogen.

155
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:39,270
And Earth got divided up into things
like sulfur, phosphorus ion, by the way,

156
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,170
do this kind of investigating.

157
00:09:41,171 --> 00:09:46,171
Do you have to boil and pull and tongue
and fry and steam and do things like

158
00:09:47,141 --> 00:09:49,440
that? All of the above.
So to fast forward,

159
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:52,330
after enough of this boiling and tugging
and frying and steaming [inaudible]

160
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:56,080
chemists got all the way down to
the root of it, which was the Adam.

161
00:09:57,570 --> 00:09:58,403
That's really

162
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:02,680
what an element is. It's a particular
kind of Adam. The problem was though,

163
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:04,840
when chemists began to
start measuring these atoms,

164
00:10:04,841 --> 00:10:07,840
they found that they were all
different sizes and types.

165
00:10:07,841 --> 00:10:10,750
Like one would be heavy,
another would be light.

166
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:12,640
Third one would be really friendly,

167
00:10:12,641 --> 00:10:16,120
likes to link up with other atoms where
as the fourth would be a loner and they

168
00:10:16,121 --> 00:10:20,860
would come in combinations like heavy,
friendly, heavy, Shy, light, friendly,

169
00:10:20,861 --> 00:10:23,380
light shine. What was the
pattern? That was the question.

170
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:27,130
Could they fit all of these differences
and similarities into one big,

171
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:33,950
you mentioned his name. You have to me
here, show you a picture of the um, um,

172
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,510
here's where we get to Oliver's hero.

173
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:39,380
The Siberian big a mist I skew is cold.

174
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,310
That would be Dimitri Mandalay, the great
men delay of whom we will talk about.

175
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:46,730
Oliver has a black and white picture
of him on his kitchen cabinets.

176
00:10:46,731 --> 00:10:50,440
Man is not going to win any,
any beauty content? No. He uh,

177
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:54,740
he looks like a mixture
between a Rasputin and um,

178
00:10:56,060 --> 00:11:00,290
uh, who do, I mean, what do you
mean? He has a big nose, a shaggy,

179
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:03,800
slightly unkempt white beard and
mustache that goes all over the place.

180
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:08,900
Piercing eyes, thick eyebrows and looks
like he's in a hunchback position.

181
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:11,480
Generally, if you met him on the sidewalk,

182
00:11:11,481 --> 00:11:14,540
you'd probably want to
walk around him. Yeah.

183
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:17,360
He didn't believe in wasting
time going to a barber.

184
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:21,110
Let me just ask you as the degree of
your passion, when you look at this man,

185
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:24,990
do you think he's a beautiful looking
guy or do you see what I see? Um,

186
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:29,760
I think mentally I've had a
beautiful mind. All right. Okay.

187
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,940
In 1860, uh, along dating 16th,

188
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:38,460
there were trains going all over Russia
and [inaudible] could afford to take

189
00:11:38,461 --> 00:11:43,140
trains. He was often on enormous
journeys and to wile away the tide.

190
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:46,170
Since he couldn't do chemical
experiments or whatever,

191
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:50,820
he would take playing cards with
the name of various elements,

192
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:54,130
their chemical and physical
properties, and he would play

193
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:58,330
what he called chemical solitaire,
sorting them for likeness or sorting.

194
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:03,130
I'm fed, I, I don't know the details,
but you know what we can imagine, right?

195
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:05,740
Sure. Let's just say he's Day
sitting there on the train.

196
00:12:05,741 --> 00:12:10,741
He's looking out the window to get these
trees made of carbon carbon like a lake

197
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,590
made of hydrogen and oxygen, oxygen,

198
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:17,830
oxygen behind that amount
should be made of silica,

199
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:22,210
any shuffling the properties and
the atomic weights in his mind.

200
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:26,710
Wondering how do these things go to
Karen? What's the pattern? Any shuffling,

201
00:12:26,711 --> 00:12:31,170
I'm shuffling, shuffling,
shuffling traffic,

202
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,560
and he did this for years until one night.

203
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:38,213
This we think is true.

204
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:43,280
In February of 1869 he has said
to have had a dream and his dream.

205
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:46,320
All the atoms have all the
elements of all the world.

206
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:49,350
If that wants a smaller points,
dense warrants, the heavy warrants,

207
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:50,340
the friendly ones to shine.

208
00:12:50,341 --> 00:12:55,170
Once they all begin to dance
in his mind and then snapped

209
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,113
into a grid,

210
00:12:57,570 --> 00:13:01,530
he awoke with a vision
of the periodic table.

211
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:04,480
Oh

212
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,320
dreams, which he then wrote
on the back of an envelope.

213
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:15,270
[inaudible] is the thing about what he
wrote on the back of that envelope is

214
00:13:15,271 --> 00:13:19,560
that it starts out so
simply left to right.

215
00:13:19,561 --> 00:13:22,490
The Adam's just getting heavier and
heavier Nav. You feel heavy on it,

216
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:25,680
but every so often, and this is
what he intuited in his dream,

217
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:27,250
is it while they're getting heavy,

218
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:31,410
are there other traits like whether
they're shy or magnetic or whatever those

219
00:13:31,411 --> 00:13:35,200
traits, o repeat, UDL
decree changed Berger, Uri,

220
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:36,960
and every time they do start a new route,

221
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:41,220
it brought with these repeat again out
of this simple repeating structure.

222
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:45,720
Mentally, if you get a table that
you can read in a million ways,

223
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:49,950
there are so many ways to read this table.

224
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:54,570
I'm going to call this the PDL dictate
that if you use your imagination,

225
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:02,830
you can see yourself in there.
I was a rather shy kid with a,

226
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:06,640
uh, difficulty forming relationships. Um,

227
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:11,880
and I sometimes compared myself to the
inert gases in nerd cancers are very

228
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:13,630
isolated.

229
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:17,950
They react with nothing because I felt
that they too had difficulties forming

230
00:14:17,951 --> 00:14:22,780
relationships. But um, I did, uh,

231
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:29,440
he has now left the chair and has moved
to the library as taking on an a hugely

232
00:14:29,441 --> 00:14:32,110
thick, actually a dangerously thick book.

233
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:34,600
This is the handbook of
physics and chemistry.

234
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:37,360
As you'll see it says 5,000 pages.

235
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:42,810
I had a smaller version as a boy
and I'm from brooding in this book.

236
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:47,710
It seemed to me just possible
that one of the inert gases,

237
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:53,250
xenon might be seduced into combination
by the most active element of all,

238
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:59,530
which was flew in this lonely, lonely
gas might find a partner somehow. Yeah.

239
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:01,490
Did they ever get together? In fact,

240
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:06,580
it came to me with great joy when I found
out her in the 1960s that a actually a

241
00:15:07,101 --> 00:15:11,440
Canadian chemist hadn't fact
made, a flew out of xenon

242
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:19,250
elemental love. And speaking of love,

243
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:23,960
he then took us, let's come
here to the living room.

244
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:27,980
And he showed us a small
painting in the painting.

245
00:15:27,981 --> 00:15:32,981
There was this dramatic
figure of a bearded scowling
character on the side of a

246
00:15:33,351 --> 00:15:36,440
mountain holding two stone
tablets over his head.

247
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:41,290
And the sky was filled with lightning.
And who was it? It was Dimitri Mandalay.

248
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:46,050
F when I heard of how mental AAF had, um,

249
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:49,430
discovered the periodic table,

250
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:54,970
I imagined men to laugh as a sort of
Moses going up to a chemical Sinai and

251
00:15:56,091 --> 00:15:58,940
coming down with the
tablets of the periodic law.

252
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:04,740
And when I mentioned this fantasy
to Peter Celkon, my friend,

253
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:07,790
uh, an artist, he did this, imagine it,

254
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,000
of picture of the young Mendillo f peaks
of a chemical Sinai behind him holding

255
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:17,390
aloft the tablets of the periodic table,

256
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:21,890
which raises maybe the
deepest question of all,

257
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:27,100
did Mendeley a think this up and impose
it upon the world or was this pattern

258
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:32,330
always there? In which case mentally
you've just removed the veil and said,

259
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:33,450
oh, very, you are,

260
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:37,560
is the periodic table a
discovery or an invention?

261
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:42,450
Is it a human construct or is it a
revelation of the cosmic or divine order?

262
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:43,763
Is it so to speak?

263
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,333

yeah. Hey,

I'm Jad Abumrad and I'm Robert
Krulwich. This is Radiolab.

283
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:10,320
How do we continue with our ongoing
appreciation of the Great Dimitri Mandalay

284
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:13,813
[inaudible]

285
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:15,983
[inaudible]

286
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:16,823
wow.

287
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:17,761
And, and,

288
00:19:17,761 --> 00:19:22,500
and let's also get back to the question
that Oliver sacks asked about Dmitri

289
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,191
Mendeleev before the break,

290
00:19:23,191 --> 00:19:26,970
which is when a scientist looks out
at the world and sees a pattern,

291
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:30,390
is that the scientist mind projected
onto the chaos of the world?

292
00:19:30,391 --> 00:19:35,391
So is the discovery in the scientist
or is it out there in the world,

293
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:38,910
right? Meaning it just
exists independent of us,

294
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:40,650
doesn't care if we find
it or not. Exactly.

295
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:45,360
Is it a human construct or is it a level
Asian of the cosmic or divine order?

296
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:49,440
That's the question. And it
can lead to some fairly well,

297
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:51,950
sad and riveting. Do you

298
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,840
mind waiting for you? Ooh, this
story comes to us from Alan Lightman,

299
00:19:56,940 --> 00:20:00,920
a theoretical physicist working out
in cal tech. Once upon a time, Alan,

300
00:20:00,921 --> 00:20:03,260
when he was a scientist, he
was working on a problem,

301
00:20:03,261 --> 00:20:07,520
a problem that had to deal
with on astronomic object
called a globular cluster,

302
00:20:07,521 --> 00:20:10,160
which is a collection of
about a million stars.

303
00:20:10,161 --> 00:20:12,770
So he's got a Glob of
stars orbiting each other.

304
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:15,830
And the question he's asked
is how do they hang together?

305
00:20:15,831 --> 00:20:18,560
Tell me a little bit about the
gravity that links them. And he,

306
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:21,080
he thought he'd made a
discovery that was brand new.

307
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:25,430
So I was in the process of writing up
the paper. I'd done the calculations,

308
00:20:25,431 --> 00:20:29,810
I was writing the paper and I was
in the library as one often does,

309
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,330
putting in the footnotes
and the references.

310
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:36,760
And one of the things that you do in
the references is you cite other people

311
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:40,670
have done similar things and ideally
you should do this before you start the

312
00:20:40,671 --> 00:20:41,504
problem.

313
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:49,390
So I was flipping through some of the
most current journals and I saw a title

314
00:20:51,131 --> 00:20:56,131
that looked alarmingly like the title
that my article would have been.

315
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:00,610
I got this terrible Pang,

316
00:21:00,611 --> 00:21:02,980
a bang society that went through me.

317
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:06,860
Uh,

318
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:08,300
so open up the journal

319
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:14,800
and these two guys from Japan had
solved the same problem that I had and I

320
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:21,350
pulled out my notebook of results and
started comparing my results against their

321
00:21:21,351 --> 00:21:25,190
results. And the numbers agreed
to like three decimal places.

322
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:28,760
So what they found was exactly
what you had found. Well,

323
00:21:28,761 --> 00:21:31,940
they would have to find exactly what
I'd found because this is the world of

324
00:21:31,941 --> 00:21:35,420
science and the world of science
has this terrible precision.

325
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:39,740
I was crestfallen.

326
00:21:39,741 --> 00:21:44,120
I was a so disappointed.
I felt humiliated.

327
00:21:44,121 --> 00:21:45,230
I felt stupid.

328
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:48,360
Uh,

329
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:53,360
and then another sensation went through
me and that was a feeling of amazement

330
00:21:55,690 --> 00:22:00,690
that these two guys on the other side
of the planet with no communication with

331
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:03,400
me sitting at their desks,

332
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:08,350
worked on the same problem and
had gotten the same results,

333
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:12,490
the exact same results. You know,

334
00:22:12,491 --> 00:22:16,840
all of the philosophers like Bishop
Barkley who said, it's all in our mind,

335
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:20,320
they're all wrong. Any scientist,

336
00:22:20,321 --> 00:22:23,800
anywhere in the universe solving this
problem would have gotten that answer.

337
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:28,840
There. Willy is something outside of
our bodies and independent of our minds,

338
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:33,700
and this is both a wonderful
thing and a terrible thing.

339
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:37,630
It's a wonderful thing because
there's a beauty to it.

340
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:42,130
There's a feeling of power and
control. But the tragedy of this,

341
00:22:42,131 --> 00:22:43,840
which I felt at the same time,

342
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:48,250
is that what is the relevance
of me as an individual person?

343
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,480
If anybody else could have
solved the same problem,

344
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:57,760
then why was I needed? What
is the meaning of my life?

345
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,760
How do I leave my
individuality on the world?

346
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:06,360
Certainly not through science.

347
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:10,740
[inaudible]

348
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:11,700
so here's what happened.

349
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:17,100
Alan gave up the practice of bench
science and became a novelist.

350
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:21,240
Einstein's dreams when the Pulitzer
Prize, great book. That's his work.

351
00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:22,860
It couldn't have happened without him.

352
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:27,390
And that is a profound difference
between the sciences and the arts.

353
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:33,470
Jeff, if the Ode to joy had
not been in Beethoven's head,

354
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,510
you don't think they would
have come around? Yeah,

355
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:36,261
that's right. I,

356
00:23:36,261 --> 00:23:40,070
the tempest is not going to have been
written by anybody but Shakespeare.

357
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:43,370
The brief and wondrous life
of Oscar Way oh by Juno Diaz,

358
00:23:43,371 --> 00:23:46,040
which is the novel I just finished,
is going to have been written

359
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:49,380
by him. So it's good by
science. But let's, um,

360
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:53,810
let's argue the other side for
just a second. Okay. There's, oops.

361
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:56,240
Okay, I'm back. Um,

362
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:59,510
there's an idea floating around that gives
the scientists a little bit more. Um,

363
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,930
I dunno, you'll probably like it.
It comes from another physicist.

364
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,220
Can you just introduce yourself?

365
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:07,640
Casey, forget you're talking
today. I'm Paul Davis.

366
00:24:07,641 --> 00:24:11,720
I'm director of the beyond center for
fundamental concepts in science at Arizona

367
00:24:11,721 --> 00:24:12,530
State University.

368
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:16,020
So Paul Davies starts with a basic
question which humans have been asking

369
00:24:16,021 --> 00:24:19,500
forever. Why are we here?
If you think about it,

370
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:24,420
it's totally crazily improbable that we
are here asking these questions that,

371
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:25,520
I don't know,

372
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,110
13.7 billion years ago

373
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:31,310
[inaudible]

374
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:36,140
the universe is born and a
shower particles that somehow
cool in just the right

375
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:36,980
way to form atoms,

376
00:24:36,981 --> 00:24:40,790
which somehow gather in just the
right way to form stars and galaxies,

377
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:45,830
a planet with sunrises and sunsets and
just the right atmosphere to give rise to

378
00:24:46,881 --> 00:24:49,520
a creature that can look at the
sunrises and sunsets and say,

379
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:51,713
wow,

380
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:56,700
if the fundamental laws of physics or the
initial conditions on the universe but

381
00:24:57,090 --> 00:25:00,350
then is slightly different, then there
would be no life and no observers,

382
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:03,120
no one to say. Wow. And the question is,

383
00:25:03,121 --> 00:25:06,150
is that a significant fact
or just an incidental fact?

384
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:09,640
A lot of scientists would say,
well, it's a fluke that we're here,

385
00:25:09,641 --> 00:25:11,530
that we have a mind that
we ask these questions

386
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:12,940
and I think it's a big deal.

387
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:17,830
We've been made privy to the
fundamental nature of the universe.

388
00:25:17,831 --> 00:25:22,330
The rules on which the universe runs.
It's basic laws. If we've just accident,

389
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:27,360
why aren't we just here looking at the
universe surviving but having no clue and

390
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:31,660
the only way I can make sense of it is
to suppose that there is some sort of

391
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:36,700
link between the laws of the universe
and the emergence of of life and

392
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:41,701
consciousness that the existence of
observers like ourselves is part of the

393
00:25:43,001 --> 00:25:44,110
explanatory story.

394
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:45,360
In other words, says Paul,

395
00:25:45,361 --> 00:25:49,620
the fact that we're here understanding
at least trying to know the universe

396
00:25:49,621 --> 00:25:54,450
works on some scientific level. He
thinks that's part of the grand scheme,

397
00:25:54,810 --> 00:25:56,850
that somehow the universe,

398
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,750
the atoms in the universe
need to be understood.

399
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:02,380
Well, the universe has engineered,

400
00:26:02,381 --> 00:26:07,381
it's its own self awareness that that
the universe has thinking beings within

401
00:26:07,781 --> 00:26:09,300
it. You can think about it.

402
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:11,100
I'm going to compare the thinking beings.

403
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:15,600
Like on the one hand maybe you had Cezanne
painting a portrait and on the other

404
00:26:15,601 --> 00:26:17,850
you had Einstein doing an equation.

405
00:26:17,851 --> 00:26:21,780
It sounds like if understanding
is the key that as you just said,

406
00:26:21,781 --> 00:26:24,120
that this theory would
put the scientists ahead.

407
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:25,500
Well it does and I, you know,

408
00:26:25,501 --> 00:26:29,570
I'm always wary about saying
that FFA are infuriating. My uh,

409
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,220
out out Scotty for example,

410
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:39,180
um, uh, that's not to diminish
the value of art and poetry,

411
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,840
but this thing we call silence
is a, is a near miracle.

412
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:45,870
I'm not using miracle
in the religious sense,

413
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:48,480
but the fact we can do
it I think is stupendous.

414
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:52,620
We're incredibly privileged and I
think there is some, uh, bigger,

415
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:55,710
I want to say agenda, but you have
to be very careful with these words,

416
00:26:55,920 --> 00:27:00,920
but certainly a scheme and that we
judged that a scheme to be ingenious and

417
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:04,860
beautiful for reasons we know not

418
00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:15,970
[inaudible] seems to me that the earth
would have a beautiful day and there was

419
00:27:16,871 --> 00:27:21,670
no one around who could
reflect on all that beauty.

420
00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:26,110
Then what is it? It's
there, but unappreciated.

421
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:29,200
It's not quite there enough.

422
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:30,690
You know, in the Bible,

423
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:34,740
God creates a bit of
the universe every day.

424
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:39,810
But at the end of each day, almost
as a necessary function, God says,

425
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:43,170
and it was good. He gives himself
a grade, she gets way off a grade.

426
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:47,430
So maybe this is just the Adam's way
of inspiring itself because what is a

427
00:27:47,431 --> 00:27:50,730
scientist? It's just a bunch of atoms.
Yeah. You know, it's a nice idea.

428
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:53,740
But actually in the end I
don't buy it, you know? No,

429
00:27:54,050 --> 00:27:57,470
cause he's saying that the purpose of
the universe is to create thinking beings

430
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:02,210
like us to examine it. And the best
examiners of them all are the physicists.

431
00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:05,510
Well guess what? Here's a physicist.
He is the very thing that he sort of,

432
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:07,090
it's a little miss piggy. I, yeah.

433
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:10,250
And I don't think anything that we've
learned in science in past couple of

434
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:13,040
hundred years would lead us to believe
we are at the center of anything.

435
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:15,520
I think most scientists in the
world would agree with you. And,

436
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:18,710
and one more thing just on the
level of aesthetics of beauty.

437
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:21,830
Isn't it more beautiful to think
that all of this is an accident?

438
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,300
I hate that idea.

439
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:28,480
Why hate you think that that all of this
beauty coming into being by accident is

440
00:28:31,611 --> 00:28:35,640
better than in having some purpose?
Yes. Because if it has a purpose,

441
00:28:35,641 --> 00:28:37,950
it means it's supposed to be here.
And if it's supposed to be here,

442
00:28:37,951 --> 00:28:42,380
then it's just somehow
little less. Um, amazing.

443
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:47,410
Do you know what I mean? Yeah.
I just think you're wrong. Okay.

444
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,140
Okay. Thanks. Let's keep it moving. Yeah.

445
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:53,160
Appreciating is the key according
to Paul Davis will in science,

446
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:56,370
that is sometimes harder than it sounds
because what if you're out there in the

447
00:28:56,371 --> 00:28:58,650
world, you're on the cusp
of a major discovery.

448
00:28:58,651 --> 00:29:00,030
It's right there in front of your face,

449
00:29:00,031 --> 00:29:04,860
but you happen to be looking
the other way. For example,

450
00:29:04,861 --> 00:29:07,230
take the story. So I'm very
excited to hear about your journey,

451
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:12,360
but first tell me who you are.
Okay. Uh, I'm Erica Lloyd.

452
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:14,660
I'm an editor and freelance writer.

453
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:19,610
Testing looks like the mic is on and
Erica recently took a trip with a bunch of

454
00:29:19,611 --> 00:29:23,840
scientists. Everything
is working very far away.

455
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:24,980
Quite a ways

456
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:31,250
where exactly similar between Greenland
and Siberia and all you're seeing every

457
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:36,020
day is just lots and lots of ice.
What's that? What's that like?

458
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:39,620
Ice Is really beautiful.
July 5th among the deck.

459
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:42,010
We're looking in the Arctic
Ocean. I mean it's just

460
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:43,950
one guy called. It is

461
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:48,110
cold Campfire Chili. Here it's,
it's hovering around zero degrees.

462
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:52,400
I mean sometimes when the sun
is up and it's just sparked,

463
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:53,630
glean like diamonds,

464
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:56,750
look out. It's this mermaid thing.

465
00:29:57,220 --> 00:30:01,020
You get how isolated you are.

466
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,890
Close to warmer clothes,

467
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:10,980
mittens. Maybe you can
introduce yourself. Rob resewn.

468
00:30:11,090 --> 00:30:13,940
I'm a scientist at the woods
hole oceanographic institution.

469
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,950
He's sort of the main
guy of this expedition.

470
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:18,320
We have extra shoes like should
I wear one? You're welcome to.

471
00:30:18,321 --> 00:30:22,820
So he raised the money. Millions of
dollars of government funding. Go for him.

472
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:24,900
Career wise, this is very
important. This is it.

473
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:26,750
When I was coming out of graduate school,

474
00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:31,870
I was trying to think how was I going
to make my mark in the scientific world.

475
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,930
And you know, the more
mature a field gets,

476
00:30:35,931 --> 00:30:38,180
the harder it is to do
something important.

477
00:30:39,050 --> 00:30:42,170
And sometimes in graduate school
it can feel like you're, you know,

478
00:30:42,171 --> 00:30:45,650
nine on bones as a scientist.

479
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:50,780
And I'm the Gaggle Ridge has
been a little bit of a, you know,

480
00:30:50,810 --> 00:30:52,600
in a sense it's, it's one
of the final [inaudible]

481
00:30:52,610 --> 00:30:56,610
frontiers. Wow. That's a shit petty. Nice.

482
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:59,480
So we're going to the Gecko Ridge

483
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:08,440
[inaudible]

484
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:11,590
well, it's one of the great,
unexplored places on the planet.

485
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:13,990
Basically it's an Arctic mountain range,

486
00:31:13,991 --> 00:31:18,100
two or 300 miles from the north
pole at the bottom of the ocean.

487
00:31:18,101 --> 00:31:19,900
It's like two and a half
or three miles deep.

488
00:31:19,901 --> 00:31:23,470
Making matters worse in terms of
getting there at the top of the ocean is

489
00:31:23,471 --> 00:31:26,110
covered in ice. Really,
really thick this ice.

490
00:31:26,170 --> 00:31:29,080
But the thought is if you could somehow
get there, get underneath the ice,

491
00:31:29,081 --> 00:31:31,570
get all the way down to
the bottom of the ocean,

492
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:35,320
you'll find volcanoes and you
know where you have volcanoes,

493
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,270
you might have hotsprings

494
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:41,110
where you have hot springs,
you might have life.

495
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,150
Just imagine blacks

496
00:31:44,430 --> 00:31:48,270
really toxic, billowing out
of a chimney on the sea floor,

497
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:50,370
hot enough to melt lead Jesus.

498
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:55,430
All manner of bizarre biological
organisms making a little oasis around it.

499
00:31:56,101 --> 00:31:59,130
And what kind of creatures were they
expecting to see? Weird kinds of,

500
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:01,680
I mean everyone wanted to
see a three eyed two words.

501
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:06,040
Yeah, really? Yeah. Is this a thing
as a three I tuber? No, not yet.

502
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,321
But the point is,

503
00:32:07,321 --> 00:32:10,750
is that every time that they've seen these
hot springs in different parts of the

504
00:32:10,751 --> 00:32:13,180
planet, they've found
completely new things.

505
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:17,470
Something like 600 previously unheard
of species like really strange looking

506
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:21,340
Schramm with eyes that had moved to their
backs and they have found tube worms.

507
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,890
Huh? Big Ones that look
sort of like plumes,

508
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,500
the really cool looking and they're
big. They have these little flower caps.

509
00:32:26,501 --> 00:32:26,921
In any case,

510
00:32:26,921 --> 00:32:31,000
this spot that they're going to for
various geological reasons that I don't

511
00:32:31,001 --> 00:32:34,300
really understand. It might be
the most interesting one of all,

512
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,010
but no one's ever seen it,

513
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:40,420
huh? Huh? It's too early
in the morning. 3:28 AM

514
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:43,790
[inaudible] minutes ago. As soon as that,

515
00:32:43,890 --> 00:32:48,290
but of course it took a few days to
get to the first site is probably our

516
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:51,620
colored location. This is a
place where there was evidence of

517
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:54,163
these fat,

518
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:56,650
so we thought, well, that's where
we're going to start, Erica,

519
00:32:56,651 --> 00:32:59,320
how are they actually going to get
through the ice to go down? Well,

520
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:03,310
rob reef song thinking, how am I ever
going to get to the cackle ridge?

521
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:05,130
I had a newborn, a child,

522
00:33:05,131 --> 00:33:10,131
this is I guess 1996 I was giving her
a bath and of course the whole layer of

523
00:33:11,131 --> 00:33:14,670
bath bubbles. I mean you couldn't
see the bottom of the bath tub.

524
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:18,720
Then what are the toys that she
had was a sesame street submarine,

525
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:23,070
the cookie monster, and Elmo is the
captains and all this kind of stuff.

526
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,050
And we were playing around with it.

527
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:29,370
So we dove the submarine
under the layer of bubbles.

528
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:34,530
Oh wait a minute. The submarines
underneath the bubbles.

529
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:36,090
If we could develop robots,

530
00:33:36,270 --> 00:33:40,140
robots that could go under the
Arctic ice cap to the sea floor,

531
00:33:40,170 --> 00:33:43,140
that would be a way to
move beyond, you know,

532
00:33:43,141 --> 00:33:46,950
nine on bones and navy
bring down some big game.

533
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:50,480
So finally, finally they're going
to put this thing in the water.

534
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:54,300
The verge of history. Man, I go down
and gone all the way here, Rico,

535
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,760
but the hell say we'd already gone.

536
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:57,860
I'm in this shack that's
sitting on the deck,

537
00:33:57,861 --> 00:34:01,010
a nice small heated
enclosure and it's tiny.

538
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:04,640
There's a a couple of Grad
students and you know, I'm,

539
00:34:04,641 --> 00:34:07,070
I'm hanging in there and just to
kind of squeeze into a corner.

540
00:34:07,071 --> 00:34:11,510
Everybody's got these big exposure
suits on in case you fall into the water

541
00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:14,870
pretty quickly. It starts smelling
like body odor and peanuts. You know,

542
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:18,790
it's not there. People are doing laundry?
No, they're not washing their fleets.

543
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:21,030
Oh, the stress level. How's your stress?

544
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:24,290
And then they, they dropped
the robot in [inaudible]

545
00:34:25,770 --> 00:34:27,090
letting the baby go. No.

546
00:34:27,091 --> 00:34:29,720
It's like sending your child to
preschool for the first time.

547
00:34:29,770 --> 00:34:32,200
Okay. He is funny. And [inaudible]

548
00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:35,870
so they're watching it go down deeper,
deeper, deeper, deeper, deeper, deeper,

549
00:34:35,871 --> 00:34:39,830
deeper, deeper, deeper, deeper.
What's going down, down, down.

550
00:34:39,831 --> 00:34:42,560
And they can watch on the
computer monitor on the screen.

551
00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:46,910
What you're seeing is streams of
data. So it just, just stayed. I know.

552
00:34:46,911 --> 00:34:51,500
Pictures, right? X, Y,Z , depth
time, love of blah, blah, blah.

553
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:56,010
Good. Let me get this down. Coming up,
the dropping is taking hours, hours,

554
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:58,710
writing about the meter
every five seconds.

555
00:34:58,810 --> 00:35:00,970
Oh, so 12 meters per minute.

556
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:06,400
It goes now to 187 meters
are now at 220 meters.

557
00:35:06,401 --> 00:35:09,910
373 meters or at what?
Cool. A hundred meters.

558
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:13,300
Right now it's exciting
to read the problem.

559
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:17,740
The problem is that nobody should need
music. I've got my iPod, you know,

560
00:35:17,741 --> 00:35:22,240
they start playing
music. Let's do of course

561
00:35:28,290 --> 00:35:31,930
[inaudible] and rolling.

562
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,233
[inaudible]

563
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:50,420
[inaudible]. Okay, awesome. Yep. Six
41 OBL and right. Six 41 six 31 meters.

564
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:55,010
Yes. So that's the new record. That's the
depth record for an ATV in the Arctic.

565
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:58,100
One or somebody go somebody to go
for breakfast, I'll go and just,

566
00:35:58,180 --> 00:36:00,460
and that I'm not going anywhere.
I want to thousand yen.

567
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:04,790
So it's past the 1000 meter mark and
it's moved on and makes his first mission

568
00:36:04,791 --> 00:36:08,150
goal a thousand meters.
Everything's looking great.

569
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:11,990
It's moving onto its next
goal, 2,500 meters. And then

570
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:15,910
Beta boards, it's mentioned what? Oh,

571
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:20,740
vehicle boarded the software died.
Separate bug software, bug software.

572
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:25,810
What's the matter with you? Can't you
test the software before we come up here?

573
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:27,400
So you're pissed off at this point? No,

574
00:36:27,401 --> 00:36:31,720
I wasn't because I knew how hard it was
[inaudible] but I was so stressed out,

575
00:36:31,721 --> 00:36:36,040
so stressed out. I had facial
tick tightness of my chest,

576
00:36:36,041 --> 00:36:40,400
labored breathing, eating my fingernails
to my knuckles, you know, 10 years of,

577
00:36:40,401 --> 00:36:44,140
of effort, millions of dollars,
his entire scientific career.

578
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:47,500
All of that is on the line. You know,
people kept asking me, of course,

579
00:36:47,501 --> 00:36:49,900
you know, Eric, I, you know,
had aired a microphone there.

580
00:36:49,930 --> 00:36:54,930
How do you feel trying to kind of get me
to take this kind of introspective look

581
00:36:55,121 --> 00:36:58,330
on it? And I even try, I
like sat there, you know,

582
00:36:58,570 --> 00:37:01,810
one night after things had kind of died
down and went on the front with the

583
00:37:01,811 --> 00:37:05,470
stars and said, okay, you
know, feel the moment, dude.

584
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:09,790
I can't feel the moment.

585
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:12,580
We haven't had coms from the
AUV for two and a half hours.

586
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:13,660
I've gotta get back down there.

587
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:18,550
You only have so many days on station
to do what you've been planning 10 years

588
00:37:18,551 --> 00:37:22,180
to do. And Front to a board. Yeah.
You're burning the clock. You know

589
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:27,330
Dick Dick, Dick, and you feel it, Dick
Dick. You feel that tick, tick, tick.

590
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:31,500
You can feel the Fuze tick,
tick, tick, tick, tick.

591
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:34,570
We're not finding vents here,
Dick. The clock is ticking.

592
00:37:34,571 --> 00:37:36,280
Let's move on to this next site.

593
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:43,610
Well, we went through five times zones
to get there. Took a week, took a week.

594
00:37:43,790 --> 00:37:47,010
Yeah. So you're back just chugging through
the yes. For a week. Yep. Yep, Yep.

595
00:37:47,450 --> 00:37:49,190
Tick, tick, tick. And then, yeah.

596
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,560
Whoa. That's a guess. We're
hitting some ice here.

597
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:55,920
Everything's rocking everywhere.

598
00:37:55,980 --> 00:38:00,120
Really, really big ice flow
moved in and ran us out of town.

599
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:05,460
Meaning you were stuck. Yeah. And
a big traffic jam of ice chunks.

600
00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:09,180
Exactly. There's absolutely nothing
we can do. Tick, tick, tick.

601
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:13,670
We're just waiting in the eyes, you
know, and just be fired, like, ugh.

602
00:38:14,270 --> 00:38:17,250
Or it didn't come up here
to wait, let's keep working.

603
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:19,050
Let's make something happen.

604
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:24,580
So the CTD team drops in their equipment
because that's what they do. You know,

605
00:38:24,581 --> 00:38:26,040
if you're just sitting around
in your, dropped you [inaudible]

606
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:29,190
you think so they were just
stuck there and they're like, ah,

607
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:31,350
let's throw it over the side,
see what happens. Right.

608
00:38:34,210 --> 00:38:36,290
And he found signals. Yeah.

609
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:40,090
Much stronger signals than they'd found
anywhere else. Oh, see they got lucky.

610
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:40,931
Yeah. Yeah. I mean,

611
00:38:40,931 --> 00:38:43,900
it's like interesting stuff everywhere
is what it is kind of looking like.

612
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:46,210
And this time, did the robot
have a camera? Yeah. Ooh.

613
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:50,020
They got all this video
footage. Wonderful. Wonderful.
High definition video.

614
00:38:50,770 --> 00:38:55,570
Superb. You know, and we could watch
from the ship. We're seeing it, you know,

615
00:38:55,571 --> 00:38:59,530
in the control van in real time. Is it
gonna be two berms is going to be clams.

616
00:38:59,531 --> 00:39:02,950
Is it going to be muscles? Is it going
to be snails? This is Phil [inaudible],

617
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:06,640
one of the engineers. Oh, over the
next rock. Now there is going to be,

618
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:08,050
there is going to be the next smoker,

619
00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:11,590
there's going to be the next Cali field
with clams and mussels and who knows

620
00:39:11,591 --> 00:39:16,450
what we're going to see.
And we go over this crater,

621
00:39:16,990 --> 00:39:19,570
the big rim, and then drop
back down on the other side.

622
00:39:20,350 --> 00:39:23,940
And we found these fight fields,

623
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:28,720
a whole hilltop fields just covered
in this. This is so eerie. It was,

624
00:39:28,810 --> 00:39:33,310
it was, I haven't seen anything
like that before. Yellow, yellow

625
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:35,293
fluffing stuff.

626
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:41,260
And it was really beautiful
yellow fluffy stuff. Yeah.

627
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:45,700
It was just everywhere floating
around or were on the sea floor.

628
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:48,670
We were seeing ski slopes,

629
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:52,730
like cotton candy or something that
might be growing in your yogurt. Whoa.

630
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:57,710
What's that? Like? There'd be like a
waterfall on it or I know one fall. Wow.

631
00:39:58,010 --> 00:40:02,080
Like it would just be coming
down rock. So scarps and wow,

632
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:04,250
kind of beautiful but but year.

633
00:40:06,590 --> 00:40:07,423
And it was

634
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:08,241
really,

635
00:40:08,241 --> 00:40:13,130
really frustrating what
there was a certain faction
on the ship that was really

636
00:40:13,131 --> 00:40:18,131
disappointed and they were really angry
with me but telling me that I failed

637
00:40:18,381 --> 00:40:22,250
them really. Absolutely. In
what way? That, you know,

638
00:40:22,251 --> 00:40:27,200
the combination of the AUV [inaudible]
and our technology and my leadership

639
00:40:27,410 --> 00:40:32,270
hadn't resulted in finding [inaudible]
worms. That's what we all wanted to see.

640
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:36,830
Everyone wanted to see a three eyed
to warm something really kind of

641
00:40:36,831 --> 00:40:40,160
spectacularly new and creepy and weird.

642
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:43,580
And instead the new stuff
that we found was, you know,

643
00:40:43,581 --> 00:40:47,540
this yellow fluffy stuff to the
fluff was just like whatever.

644
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:49,730
Well they was exciting
cause it meant well, okay,

645
00:40:49,731 --> 00:40:53,660
hey what's going to eat this stuff?
We're on the right trail, right?

646
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:58,130
It's gotta be something eating this
stuff. Nothing seemed to be eating no.

647
00:40:58,220 --> 00:40:59,270
Three I two worms

648
00:41:01,970 --> 00:41:02,190
[inaudible]

649
00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:07,100
and of course all of that is built on
the supposition that there are three eyed

650
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:10,920
two worms there to find, you
know, the world is the world.

651
00:41:10,921 --> 00:41:14,640
The Arctic Ocean is the Arctic Ocean.
It doesn't care what we want to see,

652
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:17,580
what's there. Is there,

653
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:20,220
whoa.

654
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:21,540
So here's the interesting thing. Robbery.

655
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:26,370
If sones comes back all that way thinking
basically this trip that I've planned

656
00:41:26,610 --> 00:41:31,380
for the last 10 years was a
bust. No vents, no two berms,

657
00:41:31,381 --> 00:41:34,670
nothing cool and amazing, just
this fluff, whatever it is.

658
00:41:34,671 --> 00:41:38,630
But then they get back and they look at
it more closely and they realize, okay,

659
00:41:38,631 --> 00:41:42,970
this stuff is microbes but not
your run of the mill micro.

660
00:41:42,971 --> 00:41:46,910
These are some of the oldest
known living organisms on earth.

661
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:49,700
We were the first to see it.

662
00:41:50,690 --> 00:41:54,500
And what's funny is that like you didn't
even know that until you got back.

663
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:59,330
Thank you. Almost missed it. Yeah. Right.
Are you going to be doing this again?

664
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:03,140
Well, any more trips? Well that uh,
that's a good question. I mean, uh,

665
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:08,180
I'm broke now. Uh, the money's all gone
field programs over, I am a, you know,

666
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:10,550
a free falling a little bit,

667
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:13,460
but the three eyed worm
is still out there and

668
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:19,450
it's still there for the taking mythic
three, I'd worm the Unicorn of the Arctic

669
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:26,260
[inaudible]

670
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:29,410
thanks to rob brief zones. And
Erica Lloyd and also before them,

671

Katelyn walkin foots and the
Brooklyn Tech Cheer Squad.

aboutSloan@wwwdotsloan.org

678
00:43:08,550 --> 00:43:10,800
hello, I'm Jad Abumrad.
Hi, I'm Robert Krulwich.

679
00:43:10,801 --> 00:43:14,850
This is radio lab and we're talking about
how scientists think about the world

680
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:17,400
and appreciate, yeah, except appreciation.

681
00:43:17,850 --> 00:43:21,390
This is something that scientists
do differently from the rest of us.

682
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:24,480
And I think this next story
is an act of appreciation.

683
00:43:24,481 --> 00:43:28,710
So different from the rest of us
that it makes me want to Barf gag.

684
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:33,980
Bring it once upon a time in a rainforest
in Costa Rica and Central America,

685
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:40,140
there was a little buck fly. It's
a butterfly. Butterflies are here.

686
00:43:40,141 --> 00:43:43,940
He flies that live in moist,
uh, tropical areas on route to,

687
00:43:44,070 --> 00:43:45,750
they're not like New York
City flies. No, no, no.

688
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:49,680
What a butterfly does is when a bot
fly is pregnant and our butterfly was a

689
00:43:49,681 --> 00:43:50,850
pregnant female,

690
00:43:51,310 --> 00:43:56,310
but she has her baby flies up
into the air carrying a baby,

691
00:43:56,401 --> 00:43:58,410
she sees in night hearing this feeder

692
00:44:00,150 --> 00:44:05,150
grabs actually grab on to the mosquito
mid-flight and drops her baby on to the

693
00:44:06,151 --> 00:44:08,550
mosquito. Why the mosquito? Well,

694
00:44:08,551 --> 00:44:10,770
because the mosquito is going to do
something very important for the baby.

695
00:44:10,771 --> 00:44:12,840
But the mosquito of course is a mosquito.

696
00:44:12,841 --> 00:44:14,880
So it's looking to paint somebody right

697
00:44:16,590 --> 00:44:21,590
when the mosquito lands in a nice warm
help potato potatoey math so she can have

698
00:44:24,390 --> 00:44:27,120
the Bob by baby is programmed to fall off

699
00:44:29,790 --> 00:44:34,710
into the mosquito bite and Mokolo. Wow,
that's impressive. Completely. Yeah.

700
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:37,380
And then mosquito probably has no
idea of any of this. No idea at all.

701
00:44:37,810 --> 00:44:38,910
You got all that. Got It. Okay,

702
00:44:38,911 --> 00:44:42,600
so now I want to introduce you
to a particular palpitating
mammal that happened

703
00:44:42,601 --> 00:44:44,370
to be in Costa Rica on our very day.

704
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:49,660
I guess I was about 24 it was
a 1973 his name is Jerry Coyne,

705
00:44:50,751 --> 00:44:54,530
37 years, I guess 35 years. But I
remember it like it was yesterday.

706
00:44:54,531 --> 00:44:59,300
This isn't an unexperienced that you
forget easily working at Harvard as a Grad

707
00:44:59,301 --> 00:45:00,800
student at the time. Yeah, I was,

708
00:45:00,801 --> 00:45:04,730
I was doing a laboratory experiment
on flies ironically. And, uh,

709
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:09,230
there was a program for Harvard graduate
students to go to the tropics for two

710
00:45:09,231 --> 00:45:12,380
months during the summer so they could
get some experience in the field and

711
00:45:12,590 --> 00:45:15,020
learn something about the
diversity of tropical nature.

712
00:45:19,350 --> 00:45:23,790
So now we've got Jerry coin, Costa
Rica walking through a forest,

713
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:27,120
doing some researchers and some research
and through the air you hear the

714
00:45:27,121 --> 00:45:32,121
distance sound of a mosquito getting
closer and closer and closer to the Gerry,

715
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:39,520
right on the head, not too far from
the crowd. And uh, and I scratch

716
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:41,573
[inaudible],

717
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:45,370
you know, it didn't go away when it
got to be about the size of a pea.

718
00:45:45,790 --> 00:45:47,650
I consulted one of my fellow students,

719
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:49,520
this friend of his happened
to be an entomologist.

720
00:45:49,521 --> 00:45:51,170
She climbed up onto a bunk bed

721
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:55,450
and she looked in my head, pulled the
hair's bag, and she said, oh my God,

722
00:45:55,451 --> 00:45:59,920
there's something moving in there.
That's when I freaked out completely.

723
00:46:00,070 --> 00:46:02,830
I started running around the field
station and going, Oh my God, Oh my God.

724
00:46:02,831 --> 00:46:06,610
I mean just physically running
in circles is mosquito bite.

725
00:46:06,910 --> 00:46:10,390
It was a little hose or something
protruding through the top of the mosquito

726
00:46:10,391 --> 00:46:15,010
bite and it was sort of wiggling around
breathing tube, like a little straw.

727
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:19,240
I was really completely freaked out.
I mean, I had a a worm in my body.

728
00:46:19,570 --> 00:46:23,410
Nobody knew how to extract it. Why
couldn't you just grab onto the,

729
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:28,120
to the periscope part in Paul because
like all marvels of evolution,

730
00:46:28,130 --> 00:46:33,100
the butt fly Maggot has devices to keep
you from pulling it out because it makes

731
00:46:33,101 --> 00:46:34,120
his living in your body.

732
00:46:34,121 --> 00:46:38,530
So it has a pair of hooks on the anal
and the other end that are dug into your

733
00:46:38,531 --> 00:46:40,780
flesh. So if you try
to pull the thing out,

734
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:43,300
it just digs in and you'll break it into,

735
00:46:43,390 --> 00:46:46,660
that is the thing you want to avoid
because it can cause a serious infection.

736
00:46:47,290 --> 00:46:48,910
Now you don't want to do
that and you know you don't.

737
00:46:48,911 --> 00:46:52,960
But what you could do however is you
could try what they called the meat cure.

738
00:46:52,990 --> 00:46:56,170
Put a slab of meat over
the wound, strap it to you.

739
00:46:56,171 --> 00:46:57,730
I would have to have
strapped, for example,

740
00:46:57,850 --> 00:47:02,590
a stake to my head which
is not practicable and then
the worm thinks that you

741
00:47:02,591 --> 00:47:05,600
know the worms breathing tube, which
is went through the mosquito bite,

742
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:07,540
it gets cut off and it's deprived of air.

743
00:47:07,541 --> 00:47:11,020
So it thinks that the steak is part of
your flesh and it burrows up through the

744
00:47:11,021 --> 00:47:13,270
steak and when it comes
out almost all the way,

745
00:47:13,271 --> 00:47:16,760
you can just remove this steak with a
worm in it. But what a clever idea. Yeah.

746
00:47:16,810 --> 00:47:21,310
The idea of toiling in the tropical heat
every day with a t-bone strapped to my

747
00:47:21,311 --> 00:47:23,380
head was not something
that I wanted to do.

748
00:47:25,230 --> 00:47:29,980
Meantime, it's some, it's causing
problems. This thing is a terrible

749
00:47:30,370 --> 00:47:34,420
itch and from time to time it would like
move or switch and you'd feel this sort

750
00:47:34,421 --> 00:47:38,620
of sharp pain, your score or you can
feel it grinding up against there.

751
00:47:38,650 --> 00:47:40,460
And when I went swimming or took a shower,

752
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:45,160
we'd get sort of freaked out because it's
air hole would be cut off and then it

753
00:47:45,161 --> 00:47:48,250
would really go nuts, you
know, make a lot of pain. So,

754
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:52,600
so I tried to avoid getting my
head under water. Meanwhile,

755
00:47:52,810 --> 00:47:55,690
that lump was getting bigger and
bigger until it sort of got noticeable.

756
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,510
Wait, how does it, what does it eating
in order to get bigger and bigger? Well,

757
00:47:59,511 --> 00:48:00,344
it's a

758
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:06,330
um, yes. Um, sitting my muscles
and tissue and my scalp.

759
00:48:06,870 --> 00:48:09,860
It's eating your flesh
then. Yeah, it is. Oh,

760
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:12,840
that's turning human flesh into fly flesh.

761
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:17,840
This fly. It's eating Jerry.
So it's more and more.

762
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:22,390
Well it is Jerry. It is and that's
the part that made me like it.

763
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:24,713
So

764
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:29,280
Jerry and the part of Jerry that is now
the butterfly leave Costa Rica and it's

765
00:48:29,281 --> 00:48:30,720
time to head back to Cambridge,

766
00:48:30,721 --> 00:48:34,830
Massachusetts at Harvard University
where Jerry's the Grad student and uh,

767
00:48:34,890 --> 00:48:36,450
you know, he has to check things out.

768
00:48:36,570 --> 00:48:38,640
So I went to the health
clinic and you know,

769
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:42,210
in about 10 minutes there was 20 doctors
around me that nobody had ever seen

770
00:48:42,211 --> 00:48:43,560
anything like this at Harvard.

771
00:48:43,561 --> 00:48:46,980
They were all curious and poking and
prodding and looking at it and doing an

772
00:48:47,250 --> 00:48:49,080
arm. But of course none of
them knew what to do about it.

773
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:51,240
Can I just decided screw
it, you know, I'm gonna,

774
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:54,300
I'm gonna let it come out and
make the best of it. I, you know,

775
00:48:54,301 --> 00:48:57,510
enjoy it as much as I could
and, and marvel at it. I mean,

776
00:48:57,511 --> 00:48:58,520
when you really think about it,

777
00:48:58,521 --> 00:49:02,940
it is amazing that an animal can take
human flesh and turn it using its own

778
00:49:02,941 --> 00:49:06,420
genes into a fly. I mean, and
you have to, marvel is so weird.

779
00:49:06,540 --> 00:49:09,190
Have you actually, I mean, I
didn't even think this misbehavior,

780
00:49:09,290 --> 00:49:11,610
it might seem weird to the
lay person, but to biologist,

781
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:16,080
it's sort of absolutely normal to, you
know, be very curious about something.

782
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:18,960
You know, I make my living on
flies, I've worked with fruit flies,

783
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:22,440
I'm a geneticist and, and here's
the fly making. It's living on me.

784
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:24,030
And I was getting more and more curious.

785
00:49:24,031 --> 00:49:26,820
I wanted to see what it looked like when
it came out. I didn't want to kill it.

786
00:49:26,850 --> 00:49:29,720
What about girls? I mean, assuming
you're dating. So like, yeah,

787
00:49:29,810 --> 00:49:34,410
can just like a total turnoff. Say Hi,
this is me and my maggot. Well, I was,

788
00:49:34,590 --> 00:49:37,080
you know, I was dating a
nurse at the time and this is,

789
00:49:37,081 --> 00:49:39,230
this is the good thing
about it. The nurse was, uh,

790
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:40,920
actually quite fascinated with this.

791
00:49:41,630 --> 00:49:45,590
Huh? I thought it was disgusting.
Cheryl Rogerson was Jerry's friend.

792
00:49:45,591 --> 00:49:48,980
She inspected the fly. Did
you give it a name? No.

793
00:49:51,260 --> 00:49:54,620
No. Jerry May have felt that way
about it, but uh, no I didn't.

794
00:49:54,621 --> 00:49:57,920
This was more of a scientific
experience. This is something you were,

795
00:49:58,010 --> 00:49:59,090
it was okay with you. Well,

796
00:49:59,091 --> 00:50:02,660
I don't remember being informed that
there were any other options. I thought,

797
00:50:02,661 --> 00:50:04,880
I thought this is just what had to happen.

798
00:50:04,910 --> 00:50:08,030
So a couple of weeks pass and the
butterfly is just getting, yeah,

799
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:09,660
bigger and bigger and bigger. It goes from

800
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:12,950
Jelly bean size to something like
the size of an egg. An Egg. Yeah.

801
00:50:12,951 --> 00:50:15,200
It was pretty big. Like a quail egg. Well,

802
00:50:15,230 --> 00:50:17,000
he's covering it now with a baseball cap,

803
00:50:17,030 --> 00:50:21,050
which is maybe one reason why they decided
to go to Fenway park one particular

804
00:50:21,051 --> 00:50:22,130
evening. That is correct.

805
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:26,510
[inaudible]

806
00:50:26,510 --> 00:50:28,100
yeah, there's the Psych Yankees game.

807
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:32,600
I wasn't gonna miss that. And uh, every
once in a while I would rub my head,

808
00:50:32,601 --> 00:50:35,540
I mean, throughout this whole gestation
of this thing, just to check on it.

809
00:50:35,541 --> 00:50:37,640
And during the game when
I wrote from my head,

810
00:50:38,060 --> 00:50:42,560
I felt something coming out of the
lump. Jerry kept saying, oh my gosh,

811
00:50:42,561 --> 00:50:46,190
oh my gosh, it's coming out. I can feel
it. So was this a little distracting?

812
00:50:46,910 --> 00:50:47,900
Uh, yeah.

813
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:52,980
A foul ball came up where
you were sitting in it

814
00:50:53,870 --> 00:50:54,020
damn.

815
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:57,250
And one of those wooden seats at Fenway
and we've narrowly escaped getting hit

816
00:50:57,730 --> 00:51:00,160
because we really weren't paying
much attention to the game at all.

817
00:51:03,540 --> 00:51:03,650
[inaudible]

818
00:51:03,650 --> 00:51:07,690
but it took a long time. I mean, it
started at the game and then it went on,

819
00:51:07,990 --> 00:51:10,130
started the game and, and
continued on until the evening

820
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:11,810
back to Jerry's apartment.

821
00:51:12,140 --> 00:51:17,000
And he kept reaching up and checking to
feel the lump and we were just hanging

822
00:51:17,001 --> 00:51:17,670
out and

823
00:51:17,670 --> 00:51:22,630
Morris gave in that and he
said he reached up and said,

824
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:25,433
it's gone.

825
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:27,333
We've gotta find it.

826
00:51:28,450 --> 00:51:32,560
I turned on the light and there was
on the pillow and it was horrifying.

827
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:35,290
What did it look like? Is it
a weekly little wormy thing?

828
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:39,720
It's sort of bulbous on one end and
then it tapers down to a little tail.

829
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:43,560
It's white fat, white Grub,
warm inch and a half long,

830
00:51:44,340 --> 00:51:46,340
and it has little black tea.

831
00:51:48,450 --> 00:51:48,580
[inaudible]

832
00:51:48,580 --> 00:51:51,220
no, I thought, oh my goodness.
That's what was in my head.

833
00:51:51,250 --> 00:51:53,880
Had I known that I might've
been more freaked out.

834
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:58,450
When you are greeting your baby there,
did you have a feeling of pride or just,

835
00:51:58,580 --> 00:52:00,680
well, no extreme curiosity. Um,

836
00:52:00,681 --> 00:52:03,480
the one thing that was extremely
striking to me was that it's,

837
00:52:04,310 --> 00:52:07,250
it's exit was completely
painless. Um, you know,

838
00:52:07,251 --> 00:52:09,440
it's painful when it's in
there, but when it comes out,

839
00:52:09,770 --> 00:52:12,830
it does so very painlessly and that's
another evolutionary phenomenon.

840
00:52:12,870 --> 00:52:16,610
Of course it's the, if the worm
was did it painfully and exited,

841
00:52:16,611 --> 00:52:20,300
then the horse or the monkey or whoever
it's infecting would just slap it and

842
00:52:20,301 --> 00:52:23,510
kill it. So what did you do when you
had the baby there on the pillow then?

843
00:52:23,511 --> 00:52:28,490
I decided I was going to try to rear
into an adult fly, you know, um,

844
00:52:28,830 --> 00:52:32,020
aside what you do. So I,

845
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:34,170
I had prepared a jar of sterile sand.

846
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:38,300
I took the worm and I drafted into the
sand and put the top on with air holes

847
00:52:38,301 --> 00:52:43,280
and hope that, um, it would, pew
paid, but unfortunately it died.

848
00:52:44,270 --> 00:52:47,360
Did you get sad? I was
extremely sad, you know,

849
00:52:47,361 --> 00:52:51,380
in the temperate zone in Boston about
flight is not gonna make it and just can't

850
00:52:51,410 --> 00:52:54,350
live. And so it was doomed from the start,

851
00:52:54,590 --> 00:52:56,900
but I wanted to see it
complete its life cycle.

852
00:52:56,950 --> 00:52:59,540
And unfortunately it
didn't quite make it so

853
00:53:02,550 --> 00:53:04,200
I did the best they
could with what I knew.

854
00:53:10,540 --> 00:53:14,920
You know, I, I think it's as an added
some richness to my life. It really did.

855
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:23,780
People still get completely horrified
when I tell them this story,

856
00:53:23,781 --> 00:53:26,190
even though to me is, you know, it's sort

857
00:53:26,190 --> 00:53:27,023
of a nice store.

858
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:35,720
Jerry [inaudible] works at the University
of Chicago and his forthcoming book is

859
00:53:35,721 --> 00:53:40,721
called why evolution is true and
we have time for one more story.

860
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:45,020
A couple of years ago, I sat down
with one of the great bug scientist,

861
00:53:45,021 --> 00:53:47,870
insect scientist in the
world. His name is Tom Eisner.

862
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:52,900
He teaches up at Cornell and has taught
more scientists to love insects than

863
00:53:53,751 --> 00:53:55,100
anyone in the world probably.

864
00:53:55,190 --> 00:54:00,190
And I guess I wondered if you spent
your whole life having feelings and very

865
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:05,060
sophisticated feelings about
tiny, almost alien lifeforms.

866
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:07,040
How does that happen?

867
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:10,760
We spoke at the 92nd
street y in Manhattan.

868
00:54:11,430 --> 00:54:16,000
It's an insects. Can you remember when
it began? According to my parents,

869
00:54:16,001 --> 00:54:19,850
when I first stood on my
feet, great. Right here.

870
00:54:19,851 --> 00:54:24,200
The Button was box MD, Beatles,

871
00:54:24,210 --> 00:54:29,120
caterpillars, ants, termites,
cockroaches. I've picked them up.

872
00:54:29,390 --> 00:54:34,390
I learned quickly not to put
them all in my mouth. Uh, I kept,

873
00:54:34,810 --> 00:54:37,080
I'm in my room. My Room was Zune.

874
00:54:38,830 --> 00:54:43,120
You were born in Berlin,
correct? From a Jewish family.

875
00:54:44,170 --> 00:54:47,680
You were, what, about three years
old when you left or thereabouts?

876
00:54:47,980 --> 00:54:49,600
Three years old went to Spain.

877
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:53,670
So you went from the Nazis
in Berlin to Spain? Yes.

878
00:54:53,890 --> 00:54:56,080
And the Spanish civil war fled for France.

879
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:59,980
My parents decided we should really
start somewhere else and we went to South

880
00:54:59,981 --> 00:55:03,760
America. And that was an
entomological paradigm.

881
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:09,170
Every living organism
has some sort of coder.

882
00:55:10,220 --> 00:55:12,650
You can build these up in your memory.

883
00:55:13,340 --> 00:55:18,340
And I used to take a whiff of that
in second classify in my mind's eye,

884
00:55:18,351 --> 00:55:22,370
according to what place smells
like Caterpillar and Beatles.

885
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:27,150
And do you ever dream
of insect? Yes. Yeah.

886
00:55:27,190 --> 00:55:31,890
I tend to dream that I am in
insect. What does that mean?

887
00:55:31,891 --> 00:55:33,210
That your dream that you are in, in Sec?

888
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:37,260
I mean you were scurrying and walking
upside down on the ceilings or leave even

889
00:55:37,261 --> 00:55:40,060
escaping. Sweating's um,

890
00:55:40,620 --> 00:55:45,000
the weirdest situation that I ever got
into in a dream was like dream that it

891
00:55:45,001 --> 00:55:45,834
was an insect.

892
00:55:46,530 --> 00:55:49,620
And I was telling another insect that
occasionally dreamed that I'm a human.

893
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:53,130
That's your dream.

894
00:55:56,130 --> 00:55:59,100
Insects were somehow my great love.

895
00:56:00,580 --> 00:56:03,620
It was very much a loner. And, uh,

896
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:08,610
if I didn't have a room full
of insects live, I was unhappy.

897
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:10,710
Tom, I wanted to ask you,

898
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:13,920
and at this moment, uh, Oliver
sacks who was on the stage with us,

899
00:56:14,340 --> 00:56:15,480
he asked Tom this question

900
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:19,610
whether you feel that insects
respond to your, you know, whether,

901
00:56:19,970 --> 00:56:24,220
whether you feel them sort of
polling and whether they, um,

902
00:56:24,910 --> 00:56:28,180
they know that you're gentle
and reliable. And for them,

903
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:32,500
you know, it's, it's a, it's
a good question. I don't,

904
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:38,040
I don't presume to read responses
on the part of the insects,

905
00:56:38,830 --> 00:56:39,730
but the older I get,

906
00:56:39,731 --> 00:56:42,850
the more difficult I find it to experiment
with them and they were ways that

907
00:56:42,851 --> 00:56:47,740
killed them. Um, bombardier
beetles can live four one,

908
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:51,100
two up to three years in your lab.
You become very attached to them.

909
00:56:51,101 --> 00:56:55,120
You give them names and when
they die, it's an event.

910
00:56:56,440 --> 00:57:00,280
So you must somehow have moments where
you feel that things are going on in that

911
00:57:00,281 --> 00:57:05,281
tiny little brain that they have
secrets hidden up their sleeves that uh,

912
00:57:06,670 --> 00:57:09,070
they might reveal. If you
find a common language,

913
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:17,050
I find that I can love nature no matter
how distant the individual organisms are

914
00:57:17,051 --> 00:57:17,884
from me,

915
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:23,760
but I reach out and hope that
I can shorten the distance
and create some feeling

916
00:57:24,851 --> 00:57:26,740
of coexistence.

917
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:34,190
[inaudible] a

918
00:57:39,810 --> 00:57:40,643
[inaudible]

919
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:43,400
Tom Eisner's book is called
for the love of insects.

920
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:46,640
It's really what it's called. Yeah.
Well, we should go check our website,

921
00:57:46,641 --> 00:57:49,640
radiolab.org for more information,
and you can always send us an

922
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:55,250
email@radiolabatwnyc.org Radiolab is
one word. Yes, it is. [inaudible] boom,

923
00:57:55,251 --> 00:57:56,600
rod. I'm Robert Krulwich.
