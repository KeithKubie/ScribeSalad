00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640
This is about death our death and how
useful it might be to dwell on the

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:11.099
prospect rather more than we're inclined
to. Many things that we need to tackle are

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:16.020
left aside because we're scared, we're scared to fail, scared to be alone with

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.369
our own feelings, scared to reject
certain people from our lives,

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.779
scared to tell our partners who we
really are, scared to take our dreams

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.480
seriously. From fear

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:33.450
we delay the lives we know we should be
leading. There is a dark but useful

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.190
solution to this delay it doesn't
involve reassurance or reminding

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.050
ourselves that there is time,

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.480
it involves aligning our thoughts to
something radically larger and scarier

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.670
than any of our doubts and hesitations,
something that can joilt us from our

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.020
timid lethargy.

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:58.109
We should use the thought of death not
to make us despair of life but to shake

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.010
us into more committedly pursuing the
life we know we need to lead.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.680
We will act when the fear of death is
finally allowed to trump the fear of

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.500
failure or humiliation, compromise or
shame. We need with the best of

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.140
intentions to nurture fear.

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.670
Imagine you're 34 and will live
optimistically to be 90.

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:27.030
This is how many winters you have left. Frighten yourself at every turn,

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.950
consider how often cancer and heart
disease strike far ahead of the average

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:38.060
death age. Read of the violent random
ways of strokes and aneurysms. Talk to

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.770
people at 55 and let them explain to you
how swiftly their years went. Terrify

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:44.640
yourself

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.920
not in the name of despair but of
inpatient courageous authenticity. In the

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.720
olden days people would buy a skull and
place it on their desk to keep their

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.070
thoughts focused.

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.930
It can now be awkward buying a skull, let
this be a skull.

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.110
Fear is the big obstacle to doing the
important stuff.

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:10.050
Deliberately scare yourself about the
only thing you need to fear and thereby

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:15.390
be liberated to get on with everything
else that so badly needs doing.
