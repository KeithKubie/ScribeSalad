00:00:00.571 --> 00:00:03.050
Voiceover: Let's revisit
the scenario where everyone

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:05.849
is trying to exit country B's currency

00:00:05.849 --> 00:00:08.601
and convert it back into country A.

00:00:08.601 --> 00:00:11.569
We saw in the last video that if,

00:00:11.569 --> 00:00:13.473
just left to its own devices,

00:00:13.473 --> 00:00:14.886
if this were to happen,

00:00:14.886 --> 00:00:18.169
if lot of Bs wanted to
converted into currency A

00:00:18.169 --> 00:00:22.401
and because everyone is
afraid to convert into B now

00:00:22.401 --> 00:00:24.010
because they think for whatever reason

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:26.321
the country B is in bad shape,

00:00:26.321 --> 00:00:28.010
then you have this imbalance

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:29.337
and if you left it to its own devices,

00:00:29.337 --> 00:00:32.637
country B's currency
would become devalued.

00:00:32.637 --> 00:00:37.994
You would need more Bs to trade for an A,

00:00:40.486 --> 00:00:47.239
which is just another way to
say B's value would go down,

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:48.516
and that could be a bad thing,

00:00:48.516 --> 00:00:50.735
especially if it's a pretty steep decline.

00:00:50.735 --> 00:00:52.348
Maybe it's a country that needs

00:00:52.348 --> 00:00:54.309
to import fuel from the rest of the world.

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:56.509
Maybe they need to import food
from the rest of the world,

00:00:56.509 --> 00:00:58.861
and if their currency were
to devalue dramatically,

00:00:58.861 --> 00:01:01.958
then imports could become
very, very, very expensive

00:01:01.958 --> 00:01:03.269
and so people in that country might have

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:04.925
to pay double for gas and double

00:01:04.925 --> 00:01:08.285
for basic necessities like
food and whatever else.

00:01:08.285 --> 00:01:11.068
So we played out a scenario
where the central bank

00:01:11.083 --> 00:01:13.395
of country B actively tries to intervene

00:01:13.395 --> 00:01:15.154
to keep this from happening,

00:01:15.154 --> 00:01:17.075
to keep the exchange rate stable,

00:01:17.075 --> 00:01:22.874
and so what they do is
they could use reserves,

00:01:22.874 --> 00:01:25.155
and I'll do this in blue for country B,

00:01:25.155 --> 00:01:29.507
so they could use reserves of
A that they have accumulated

00:01:29.507 --> 00:01:36.027
during better times or in previous videos,

00:01:36.027 --> 00:01:37.603
depending on how you want to view them,

00:01:37.603 --> 00:01:39.770
and they try to balance
out the supply of A's

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.624
with the supply of B's by selling

00:01:43.624 --> 00:01:45.674
their reserves and buying B's.

00:01:45.674 --> 00:01:47.842
So one way to think of it,
they're adding supply of A's

00:01:47.842 --> 00:01:52.026
and they're also adding demand for B's.

00:01:52.026 --> 00:01:53.178
They're going to sell their reserves

00:01:53.178 --> 00:01:56.203
of A and buy their own currency.

00:01:56.203 --> 00:01:58.714
And that would work as
long as they have reserves.

00:01:58.714 --> 00:02:00.434
They're going to be
able to stabilize things

00:02:00.434 --> 00:02:03.274
so that this situation doesn't happen.

00:02:03.274 --> 00:02:04.850
But the problem was,

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:06.435
and we talked about it at
the end of the last video

00:02:06.435 --> 00:02:08.236
is that they can run out here.

00:02:08.236 --> 00:02:10.314
It's not like they can print

00:02:10.314 --> 00:02:13.657
another country's currency forever.

00:02:13.657 --> 00:02:14.794
They can't print it at all.

00:02:14.794 --> 00:02:16.554
They have to accumulate this.

00:02:16.554 --> 00:02:18.075
This isn't their own currency.

00:02:18.075 --> 00:02:19.747
So they have a finite amount of this.

00:02:19.747 --> 00:02:21.347
They could eventually run out.

00:02:21.347 --> 00:02:23.641
What is often the case is,

00:02:23.641 --> 00:02:25.282
currency speculators see this

00:02:25.282 --> 00:02:27.022
and they begin to smell blood.

00:02:27.022 --> 00:02:28.314
They see, okay look,

00:02:28.314 --> 00:02:29.450
people are trying to exit this currency.

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.426
It would devalue if it was
left to its own devices,

00:02:32.426 --> 00:02:37.835
but the central bank of
country B is trying to keep it

00:02:37.835 --> 00:02:39.538
from devaluing by depleting

00:02:39.538 --> 00:02:42.418
its finite reserves of currency A.

00:02:42.418 --> 00:02:45.154
So what currency speculators
will start to do is,

00:02:45.154 --> 00:02:48.881
well I can go into country
B and I can borrow B's.

00:02:48.881 --> 00:02:51.466
So I could literally go
to a bank in country B

00:02:51.466 --> 00:02:55.154
and borrow some of the B currency,

00:02:55.154 --> 00:02:57.377
and then I could go to
the exchange markets

00:02:57.377 --> 00:03:04.581
and try to convert it into A's.

00:03:04.642 --> 00:03:06.947
Just off of looking at that superficially,

00:03:06.947 --> 00:03:08.340
what's that going to do?

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:09.604
Well this is going to make the situation

00:03:09.604 --> 00:03:11.506
even worse for the central bank,

00:03:11.506 --> 00:03:12.962
because now you have people actively

00:03:12.962 --> 00:03:14.731
that don't even hold B's before

00:03:14.731 --> 00:03:16.042
they're going to be borrowing B's

00:03:16.042 --> 00:03:17.531
and converting them into A's.

00:03:17.531 --> 00:03:19.915
So it's going to create
an even larger supply

00:03:19.915 --> 00:03:24.083
of B's and even more demand
for the finite number

00:03:24.083 --> 00:03:27.155
of A's that are willing to go this way.

00:03:27.155 --> 00:03:28.785
And why is the speculator doing this?

00:03:28.785 --> 00:03:30.987
Well think about the
two situations for them.

00:03:30.987 --> 00:03:34.587
Let me draw the two scenarios.

00:03:34.587 --> 00:03:39.622
Scenario one is that for
whatever reason the central bank

00:03:39.622 --> 00:03:42.109
of B is able to keep
the currency stabilized.

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:48.893
So currency stays stable.

00:03:48.893 --> 00:03:51.101
And the other scenario is that

00:03:51.101 --> 00:03:53.141
the central bank runs out of reserves,

00:03:53.141 --> 00:03:55.916
and they have to essentially
just let the currencies float,

00:03:55.916 --> 00:03:58.509
and B gets devalued.

00:03:58.509 --> 00:04:04.746
So central bank out of reserves,

00:04:05.745 --> 00:04:08.007
which would mean that the currencies

00:04:08.007 --> 00:04:16.528
would float and B would devalue.

00:04:16.528 --> 00:04:18.616
Well if this first scenario happens,

00:04:18.616 --> 00:04:21.712
and it's happens, and it's going to become

00:04:21.712 --> 00:04:24.054
less and less likely as
more and more people pile on

00:04:24.054 --> 00:04:25.951
this strategy and more and more people try

00:04:25.951 --> 00:04:29.784
to run out of B's or try
to exit B's currency.

00:04:29.784 --> 00:04:31.936
But even if this situation were to happen,

00:04:31.936 --> 00:04:33.711
the speculator says okay,

00:04:33.711 --> 00:04:35.672
the currency ended up being stable.

00:04:35.672 --> 00:04:36.783
I'll just unwind this.

00:04:36.783 --> 00:04:39.183
I'll take my A's, when I have
to pay off my debt in B's,

00:04:39.183 --> 00:04:40.078
I'll take my A's, convert them

00:04:40.078 --> 00:04:42.124
into B's and pay off my debt.

00:04:42.124 --> 00:04:44.122
And so depending what the interest rates

00:04:44.122 --> 00:04:45.123
and all of that were,

00:04:45.123 --> 00:04:50.168
not a big loss or maybe
even a minimal loss,

00:04:50.183 --> 00:04:51.780
and only if there's a kind of differential

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:53.364
with interest rates or things like that,

00:04:53.364 --> 00:04:57.488
minimal to no loss.

00:04:57.488 --> 00:04:59.811
But what happens if the central
bank runs out of reserves?

00:04:59.811 --> 00:05:01.618
Remember just the fact
that the speculators

00:05:01.618 --> 00:05:03.306
are doing this speculative attack,

00:05:03.306 --> 00:05:07.986
they're borrowing in country
B and converting to A,

00:05:07.986 --> 00:05:09.541
that's making the central bank

00:05:09.541 --> 00:05:11.467
run out of reserves even faster.

00:05:11.467 --> 00:05:13.098
It's going to deplete their reserves.

00:05:13.098 --> 00:05:14.554
Essentially when they do this,

00:05:14.554 --> 00:05:16.242
it's the central bank of country B

00:05:16.242 --> 00:05:17.450
that's going to be giving them,

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:19.209
is going to be allowing them to convert.

00:05:19.209 --> 00:05:20.402
They don't know who they're

00:05:20.402 --> 00:05:23.986
buying these B's from with
this A currency they have.

00:05:23.986 --> 00:05:25.610
So if this happens,

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:27.194
if the central bank runs out of reserves,

00:05:27.194 --> 00:05:28.939
it floats, and then B devalues,

00:05:28.939 --> 00:05:30.754
then those currency speculators

00:05:30.754 --> 00:05:32.466
make a pretty good buck.

00:05:32.466 --> 00:05:34.177
and just to see how that could work,

00:05:34.177 --> 00:05:39.961
imagine that they borrow 100 B's,

00:05:39.976 --> 00:05:43.570
so this is what they borrow,

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:47.643
and while the currency is
being actively intervened

00:05:47.643 --> 00:05:48.987
with by the central bank,

00:05:48.987 --> 00:05:50.715
they're trying to keep it from devaluing,

00:05:50.715 --> 00:05:56.226
the exchange rate is one A for one B,

00:05:56.226 --> 00:06:03.187
so they convert on the open market,

00:06:03.187 --> 00:06:04.556
and the only reason this is able to happen

00:06:04.556 --> 00:06:07.002
at this exchange rate is
because B's central bank

00:06:07.002 --> 00:06:08.619
is actively selling A's,

00:06:08.619 --> 00:06:13.740
they're able to convert to 100 A's.

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:15.443
Now let's say that they're able to do this

00:06:15.443 --> 00:06:18.116
and the central bank runs out of A's

00:06:18.116 --> 00:06:20.092
and then a devaluation occurs.

00:06:20.092 --> 00:06:26.412
So this is happening at a
conversion of one A equals one B.

00:06:26.412 --> 00:06:29.379
But let's say that these guys,
they run out of reserves.

00:06:29.379 --> 00:06:30.691
The things devalue.

00:06:30.691 --> 00:06:32.507
B becomes worth a lot less,

00:06:32.507 --> 00:06:34.364
and then we go to a future state

00:06:34.364 --> 00:06:38.019
where one A is now equal to two B's.

00:06:38.019 --> 00:06:39.308
Well as soon as this happens,

00:06:39.308 --> 00:06:41.276
and remember this is this
scenario right over here

00:06:41.276 --> 00:06:42.781
that we're thinking about right over here,

00:06:42.781 --> 00:06:44.844
this is what the currency
speculators want to happen.

00:06:44.844 --> 00:06:47.028
If one A all of a sudden equals two B's

00:06:47.028 --> 00:06:49.700
because the central bank
can't intervene any more,

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:52.684
they are floating, B gets devalued.

00:06:52.684 --> 00:06:53.916
Then what's going to happen?

00:06:53.916 --> 00:06:55.740
These guys can take their 100 A's.

00:06:55.740 --> 00:07:00.132
Convert it back once things are floating.

00:07:00.132 --> 00:07:03.251
So now they're going to convert
back into this direction.

00:07:03.251 --> 00:07:05.427
And how many B's can they convert it into?

00:07:05.427 --> 00:07:11.383
Well now they can convert it into 200 B's.

00:07:11.383 --> 00:07:13.628
They can pay off their debt

00:07:13.628 --> 00:07:15.037
because they borrowed the 100 B's,

00:07:15.037 --> 00:07:20.620
so minus 100 B's to pay debt,

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:23.491
and then they make a
pretty sizable profit.

00:07:23.491 --> 00:07:27.291
They make a profit of 100 B's.

00:07:27.291 --> 00:07:29.236
That's exactly what they're hoping for,

00:07:29.236 --> 00:07:31.476
and so you can imagine
this is one of those trades

00:07:31.476 --> 00:07:32.513
that they're going to try to get more

00:07:32.513 --> 00:07:33.927
and more people to do,

00:07:33.927 --> 00:07:35.049
because the more people that jump

00:07:35.049 --> 00:07:37.440
on the band wagon and do
this exact same strategy,

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:39.496
the faster the central bank's reserves

00:07:39.496 --> 00:07:40.417
are going to deplete,

00:07:40.417 --> 00:07:46.116
and the more likely that this situation

00:07:46.116 --> 00:07:48.555
right over here plays out.
