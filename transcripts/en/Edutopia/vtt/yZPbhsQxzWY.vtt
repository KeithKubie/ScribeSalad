&gt;&gt;Michael: I think social media, it
really directly helps the students see

00:00:08.056 --> 00:00:11.256
that school is not this classroom.

00:00:11.626 --> 00:00:16.216
School is the world, and so when
you have direct links to that world,

00:00:16.906 --> 00:00:18.686
then they understand
the power of learning.

00:00:28.086 --> 00:00:30.326
&gt;&gt;Pam: I got people that are walking
into Albemarle County virtually

00:00:30.706 --> 00:00:35.346
and working with teachers, and as
Superintendent, I don't have this mote

00:00:35.346 --> 00:00:39.186
around the school division anymore
that determines who gets to come or go,

00:00:39.186 --> 00:00:43.706
and then I started realizing that what
people were doing was sharing resources,

00:00:43.706 --> 00:00:47.286
they were asking questions, they
were engaging in interacting

00:00:47.336 --> 00:00:49.176
around the work of learning.

00:00:49.846 --> 00:00:54.166
&gt;&gt;Karen: This part will
be the Colosseum.

00:00:54.796 --> 00:00:56.966
&gt;&gt;As a classroom teacher, I'm lucky

00:00:56.966 --> 00:00:59.016
to know what other grade levels
are doing some of the time,

00:00:59.016 --> 00:01:01.756
much less what are teachers
in other schools doing.

00:01:01.756 --> 00:01:04.996
So what we do is connect
with Twitter a lot.

00:01:04.996 --> 00:01:07.876
I think a lot of the ideas
that I come back and share

00:01:07.876 --> 00:01:09.426
with kids, I saw on Twitter.

00:01:09.496 --> 00:01:14.456
&gt;&gt;Pam: Social media catches on in
schools in the same way that it catches

00:01:14.456 --> 00:01:16.986
on in the bigger world, that
it's kind of word of mouth.

00:01:17.496 --> 00:01:20.296
So you may have a teacher that
does something in a faculty meeting

00:01:20.296 --> 00:01:23.626
on how they use Twitter, and the next
thing you know that teacher is sitting

00:01:23.626 --> 00:01:30.106
around with five or six other teachers
that're saying, "Hey, how do I get on?"

00:01:32.806 --> 00:01:37.256
&gt;&gt;Michael: We formed a nice
little tight group with people

00:01:37.256 --> 00:01:39.066
within Albemarle County
that use Twitter,

00:01:39.366 --> 00:01:44.516
and so we pretty consistently
will Tweet each other directly

00:01:44.906 --> 00:01:46.626
to see what the other person is doing.

00:01:46.836 --> 00:01:49.876
So a hashtag that we use throughout
the district would be hashtag ACPS.

00:01:50.056 --> 00:01:53.976
It's kind of a slow process at first.

00:01:53.976 --> 00:01:55.516
You kind of send these Tweets out.

00:01:55.516 --> 00:01:57.946
You're really sending Tweets
to no one because you have

00:01:57.946 --> 00:01:59.336
like ten followers or something.

00:01:59.386 --> 00:02:01.946
But then, you know, people
start to pay attention,

00:02:01.946 --> 00:02:05.486
and luckily if you follow people
that follow you, that have a lot

00:02:05.486 --> 00:02:09.616
of followers, they will
promote you to certain ways.

00:02:10.376 --> 00:02:13.416
&gt;&gt;Pam: One day, I'm just, you
know, watching my Tweet feed,

00:02:13.416 --> 00:02:18.036
and I notice this Twitter feed from
Michael Thornton, and it pops up,

00:02:18.166 --> 00:02:21.506
and then he's got a picture of
his kids having built this tower.

00:02:21.506 --> 00:02:24.896
&gt;&gt;Student: I think it's just the
ones that have come too close

00:02:24.966 --> 00:02:26.736
to ripping that are the problem.

00:02:26.736 --> 00:02:26.896
&gt;&gt;Student: Yeah.

00:02:27.216 --> 00:02:28.706
&gt;&gt;Michael: So they're
given 20 sheets of paper.

00:02:28.966 --> 00:02:32.166
They take that paper, they can
fold it how they want to use it,

00:02:32.166 --> 00:02:34.336
but they can't use glue,
they can't use tape.

00:02:34.336 --> 00:02:38.076
And the goal to see is how high you
can actually build the paper tower.

00:02:38.296 --> 00:02:40.796
I Tweeted out the initial
pictures from it,

00:02:40.796 --> 00:02:42.316
and just kind of explained what it was.

00:02:42.606 --> 00:02:46.586
&gt;&gt;Pam: And then the next thing I know, I
see another teacher who's kind of taken

00:02:46.586 --> 00:02:48.686
on the challenge, and
she's posted a picture

00:02:48.786 --> 00:02:52.836
of her kids' tower with
them just beaming!

00:02:52.836 --> 00:02:54.576
&gt;&gt;Michael: The response
was positive right away.

00:02:55.056 --> 00:02:56.476
So I then said, "You know what?

00:02:56.476 --> 00:02:59.876
I'll create a Google Doc that people
could actually then do the challenge

00:02:59.876 --> 00:03:02.506
and then throw their
picture into the Google Doc."

00:03:03.216 --> 00:03:06.606
&gt;&gt;Pam: Next thing you know,
we've got somebody up in Chicago,

00:03:06.946 --> 00:03:10.626
we've got somebody in neighboring
Nelson County, they've built a tower.

00:03:11.196 --> 00:03:15.436
You just start to see
these ideas that seed,

00:03:16.176 --> 00:03:18.876
and then you've got connections
all over the place.

00:03:19.326 --> 00:03:20.046
&gt;&gt;Michael: Hello!

00:03:20.126 --> 00:03:21.106
Hey, welcome!

00:03:22.016 --> 00:03:25.756
&gt;&gt;Beyond just the four walls that are in
this classroom, and with their teacher

00:03:25.756 --> 00:03:28.546
or their parents, they can share
it with a classes in Chicago,

00:03:28.546 --> 00:03:31.016
or classes in Ireland,
or across the world.

00:03:31.016 --> 00:03:34.456
And that's really important
to them, because truly,

00:03:34.456 --> 00:03:36.526
what they're doing, as we know, matters.

00:03:37.676 --> 00:03:39.406
&gt;&gt;Pam: What if you don't
think about the boundaries

00:03:39.406 --> 00:03:41.666
of your school district
as being a limiter.

00:03:42.096 --> 00:03:46.496
What if you want your teachers, your
Principals, your Central Office staff,

00:03:46.766 --> 00:03:51.886
even your kids to have opportunities to
cross-pollinate across the boundaries

00:03:51.936 --> 00:03:54.296
of school districts, then all

00:03:54.296 --> 00:03:59.976
of a sudden social media makes learning
come alive in incredibly powerful ways.
