00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.019
The answer is no, we don't have enough information, we should make an instance

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:09.510
variable. The xCoord and yCoord variables are parameters in the constructor.

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.735
Which means when the constructor is done running, they go away. So then when

00:00:14.735 --> 00:00:20.870
addFriend is called later, xCoord and yCoord don't exist anymore. We can't get

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:25.110
the coordinates from the friend variable. We're talking about the coordinates

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:29.140
for where to draw the circle. And the friend probably doesn't know anything

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:34.630
about where the upper left corner of the current object is. We could take the

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:38.775
coordinates in as parameters in the addFriend method, so it would be

00:00:38.775 --> 00:00:44.840
addFriend(Person friend) int x int y. But it would be a little weird if every

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.560
time you called addFriend, you also had to pass in the x and y coordinates that

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:53.310
you originally passed in in the constructor. So if we decide to make instance

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:57.280
variables for x and y, where would we initialize them? That's one for you to

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:57.860
think about yourself.
