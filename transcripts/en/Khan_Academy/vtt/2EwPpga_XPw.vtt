00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:02.960
Just as you were
solving the potato chip

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:06.700
conundrum in the last video,
the king's favorite magical bird

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:11.072
comes flying along and starts
whispering into the king's ear.

00:00:11.072 --> 00:00:13.030
And this makes you a
little bit self-conscious,

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:14.900
a little bit
insecure, so you tell

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.580
the king, what is the
bird talking about.

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.080
And the king says,
well, the bird

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.550
says that he thinks that there's
another way to do the problem.

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:24.970
And you're not used to
taking advice from birds.

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:26.480
And so being a
little bit defensive,

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.160
you say, well, if the bird
thinks he knows so much,

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.500
let him do this problem.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.250
And so the bird whispers
a little bit more

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.850
in the king's ear and
says, OK, well I'll

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:35.849
have to do the writing
because the bird does not

00:00:35.849 --> 00:00:39.060
have any hands, or at least
can't manipulate chalk.

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.970
And so the bird continues to
whisper in the king's ear.

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:43.800
And the king
translates and says,

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.430
well, the bird says, let's
use one of these equations

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:47.990
to solve for a variable.

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:50.590
So let's say, let's us this
blue equation right over here

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:52.089
to solve for a variable.

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:53.505
And that's essentially
going to be

00:00:53.505 --> 00:00:55.730
a constraint of one variable
in terms of another.

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.250
So let's see if we can do that.

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.410
So here, if we want
to solve for m,

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.890
we could subtract 400
w from both sides.

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.910
And we would have 100 m.

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:09.970
If we subtract 400w from the
left, this 400w goes away.

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.120
If we subtract 400w
from the right,

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:19.600
we have is equal to
negative 400w plus 1,100.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.810
So what got us from
here to here is just

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.080
subtracting 400w
from both sides.

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.750
And then if we want
to solve for m,

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.000
we just divide
both sides by 100.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.740
So we just divide all
of the terms by 100.

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:42.650
And then we get m is equal to
negative 400 divided by 100,

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:45.070
is negative 4w.

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.280
1,100 divided by 100 is 11.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.030
Plus 11.

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.740
So now we've constrained
m in terms of w.

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.680
This is what the
bird is saying, using

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.450
the king as his translator.

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:56.850
Why don't we take
this constraint

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.490
and substitute it back for
m in the first equation?

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.540
And then we will have one
equation with one unknown.

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.410
And so the king starts to
write at the bird's direction.

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:12.580
200, so he's looking at
that first equation now,

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.480
he says 200.

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.010
Instead of putting
an m there, the bird

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.100
says well, by the
second constraint,

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.680
m is equal to
negative 4w plus 11.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:29.320
So instead of writing an
m, we substitute for m

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.480
the expression
negative 4w plus 11.

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:43.700
And then we have the rest of it,
plus 300w, is equal to 1,200.

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.970
So just to be clear,
everywhere we saw an m,

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.770
we replaced it with
this right over here,

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:50.065
in that first equation.

00:02:50.065 --> 00:02:52.190
So the first thing, you
start to scratch your head.

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.240
And you say, is this a
legitimate thing to do.

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.360
Will I get the same
answer as I got

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.300
when I solved the same
problem with elimination?

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.080
And I want you to sit and
think about that for a second.

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.330
But then the bird starts
whispering in the king's ear.

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.970
And the king just progresses to
just work through the algebra.

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.130
This is one equation
with one unknown now.

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.280
So the first step would
be to distribute the 200.

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:20.360
So 200 times negative
4w is negative 800w.

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.510
200 times 11 is 2,200.

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.770
Plus 2,200.

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:27.250
And then we have the plus 300w.

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:32.050
Plus 300w is equal
to positive 1,200.

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:33.830
Now we just need to solve for w.

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:36.950
We first might want to
group this negative 800w

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.600
with this 300w.

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.620
Negative 800 of something
plus 300 of something

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:46.520
is going to be negative 500w.

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:52.930
And then we still have this
plus 2,200 is equal to 1,200.

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.470
Now to solve for w, we'd want to
subtract 2,200 from both sides.

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:03.120
So subtract 2,200,
subtract 2,200.

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.780
On the left-hand
side, you're left just

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:07.405
with the negative 500w.

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:16.290
And on the right-hand side, you
are left with negative 1,000.

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:18.269
This is starting to
look interesting,

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:23.650
because if we divide both
sides by negative 500,

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:29.650
we get w is equal to 2, which
is the exact same answer that we

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:33.267
got when we tried to figure
out how many bags of chips

00:04:33.267 --> 00:04:34.600
each woman would eat on average.

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.980
When we tried to solve
it with elimination,

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:39.710
we got the exact right answer.

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:44.390
So at least for this example,
it seems like the substitution

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:48.220
method that this bird came
up with worked just as well

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.041
as the elimination method
that you had originally

00:04:51.041 --> 00:04:53.540
done the first time you wanted
to figure out the potato chip

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:54.470
conundrum.

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:57.032
And if now, you actually
wanted to figure out

00:04:57.032 --> 00:04:58.730
how many chips
the men would eat,

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:00.080
well, you could do
exactly the same thing

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.730
you did the last time.

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:01.980
You know one of the variables.

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:04.410
You can substitute it back
into one of the equations

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:06.040
and then solve for m.

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:08.510
And you could try that yourself
to verify that you actually

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:11.750
will get the same
value for m as well.

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:14.690
And in fact, this would
probably be the easiest equation

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:16.890
to substitute into,
because it explicitly

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:20.329
solves for m already.
