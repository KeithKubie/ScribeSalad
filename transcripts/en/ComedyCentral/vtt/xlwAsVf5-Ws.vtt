(AUDIENCE CHANTING LARRY'S NAME)
&gt;&gt; Larry: YES!

00:00:06.505 --> 00:00:07.073 align:start position:0% line:85%
THANK YOU!

00:00:07.106 --> 00:00:08.007 align:start position:0% line:85%
THANK YOU!

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.109 align:start position:0% line:85%
I APPRECIATE IT.

00:00:10.142 --> 00:00:10.543 align:start position:0% line:85%
YES!

00:00:10.576 --> 00:00:11.677 align:start position:0% line:85%
WE'RE BACK!

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:12.545 align:start position:0% line:85%
THANK YOU!

00:00:12.578 --> 00:00:15.014 align:start position:0% line:91%
WELCOME TO THE "THE NIGHTLY
SHOW"!

00:00:15.047 --> 00:00:17.216 align:start position:0% line:85%
I'M LARRY WILMORE!

00:00:17.249 --> 00:00:19.719 align:start position:0% line:91%
LAST NIGHT WAS THE 87th ANNUAL
ACADEMY AWARDS.

00:00:19.752 --> 00:00:22.088 align:start position:0% line:91%
WHAT A GREAT SHOW. IT REALLY
WAS. 

00:00:22.121 --> 00:00:25.792 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND I HAVE TO BE HONEST WITH
YOU.

00:00:25.825 --> 00:00:28.661 line:91%
I WAS A LITTLE CONCERNED BECAUSE
THE OSCARS WERE SORT OF SET UP

00:00:28.694 --> 00:00:36.369 size:81% position:41% line:91%
TO BE LIKE A NEW YORK CITY
WINTER -- LONG AND WHITE.

00:00:36.402 --> 00:00:37.170 align:start position:0% line:85%
TO BE FAIR.

00:00:37.203 --> 00:00:39.572 align:start position:0% line:85%
TO BE FAIR.

00:00:39.605 --> 00:00:40.840 align:start position:0% line:91%
BUT I THOUGHT NEIL PATRICK
HARRIS DID A GOOD JOB

00:00:40.873 --> 00:00:42.008 align:start position:0% line:85%
ACKNOWLEDGING THAT.

00:00:42.041 --> 00:00:43.476 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; TONIGHT WE HONOR HOLLYWOOD'S
BEST AND WHITEST -- SORRY,

00:00:43.509 --> 00:00:51.951 align:start position:0% line:85%
BRIGHTEST.

00:00:51.984 --> 00:00:59.225 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: SEE, THAT'S A PRO
RIGHT THERE.

00:00:59.258 --> 00:01:00.726 line:91%
YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THE AWKWARD
RACIAL REALITY OF THE EVENING

00:01:00.759 --> 00:01:01.661 align:start position:0% line:85%
AND MOVE ON.

00:01:01.694 --> 00:01:02.328 align:start position:0% line:85%
WELL DONE, SIR.

00:01:02.361 --> 00:01:08.601 align:start position:0% line:85%
WHAT ELSE?

00:01:08.634 --> 00:01:12.171 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; OCTAVIA SPENCER,
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS TONIGHT,

00:01:12.204 --> 00:01:13.706 align:start position:0% line:91%
DO NOT TAKE YOUR EYES OFF THE
BRIEFCASE, GOT IT?

00:01:13.739 --> 00:01:14.307 align:start position:0% line:85%
NO BATHROOM BREAKS.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.276 align:start position:0% line:85%
NO CHITCHAT.

00:01:17.309 --> 00:01:20.313 size:84% position:42% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: HOLD ON A SECOND.

00:01:20.346 --> 00:01:23.382 line:91%
YOU CAN'T MAKE A JOKE ABOUT HOW
WHITE THE OSCARS ARE AND THEN

00:01:23.415 --> 00:01:31.824 align:start position:0% line:91%
TURN AROUND AND LITERALLY MAKE
OCTAVIA SPENCER "THE HELP"!

00:01:31.857 --> 00:01:34.227 align:start position:0% line:85%
NOT WELL DONE, SIR.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:39.565 align:start position:0% line:91%
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE THAT
BACK.

00:01:39.598 --> 00:01:42.201 line:91%
LOOK, THESE OSCARS WERE SO WHITE
THAT WHEN LONNIE LYNN AND JOHN

00:01:42.234 --> 00:01:43.703 align:start position:0% line:91%
STEPHENS WON FOR BEST SONG, THEY
COULDN'T EVEN USE THEIR BLACK

00:01:43.736 --> 00:01:51.110 align:start position:0% line:85%
NAMES.

00:01:51.143 --> 00:01:54.413 align:start position:0% line:91%
THAT'S RIGHT, COMMON'S REAL NAME
IS LONNIE LYNN.

00:01:54.446 --> 00:01:55.781 align:start position:0% line:91%
GOOD CALL ON THE NAME CHANGE,
LONNIE.

00:01:55.814 --> 00:02:00.453 align:start position:0% line:85%
JUST SAYING.

00:02:00.486 --> 00:02:10.563 align:start position:0% line:91%
BUT THE THEME OF THE NIGHT WAS
SPEECHES WITH SUBSTANCE.

00:02:10.596 --> 00:02:11.998 line:91%
&gt;&gt; IT'S OUR TIME TO HAVE WAGE
EQUALITY ONCE AND FOR ALL.

00:02:12.031 --> 00:02:13.566 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THIS BRIDGE TRANSCENDS RACE,
GENDER, RELIGION.

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:15.334 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; WE ARE WITH YOU, WE SEE YOU,
WE LOVE YOU.

00:02:15.367 --> 00:02:17.470 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THAT KID OUT THERE WHO FEELS
LIKE SHE IS WEIRD OR SHE IS

00:02:17.503 --> 00:02:19.138 align:start position:0% line:91%
DIFFERENT OR SHE DOESN'T FIT IN
ANYWHERE, STAY WEIRD.

00:02:19.171 --> 00:02:23.176 align:start position:0% line:85%
STAY DIFFERENT.

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:27.246 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: WOW.

00:02:27.279 --> 00:02:29.815 size:84% position:42% line:85%
STAY WEIRD, STAY DIFFERENT.

00:02:29.848 --> 00:02:32.218 align:start position:0% line:91%
THAT'S A VERY GOOD MESSAGE. I
LIKE IT

00:02:32.251 --> 00:02:35.688 align:start position:0% line:91%
LET'S SEE IF ANYONE TOOK THAT
NOTE.

00:02:35.721 --> 00:02:38.824 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; YOU, YOU MY DARLING, MY
BEAUTIFUL, MY WICKEDLY TALENTED

00:02:38.857 --> 00:02:40.326 align:start position:0% line:85%
IDINA MENZEL.

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:40.893 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; YOU GOT IT RIGHT.

00:02:40.926 --> 00:02:52.171 align:start position:0% line:85%
YAY.

00:02:52.204 --> 00:02:53.806 line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: THAT WAS HANDS DOWN
THE WEIRDEST MOMENT OF THE

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:56.475 align:start position:0% line:85%
NIGHT.

00:02:56.508 --> 00:02:59.412 align:start position:0% line:91%
NO, SERIOUSLY, TRAVOLTA, PUT
YOUR HANDS DOWN.

00:02:59.445 --> 00:03:02.748 align:start position:0% line:85%
STAY WEIRD, NOT CREEPY.

00:03:02.781 --> 00:03:05.251 align:start position:0% line:91%
ALL RIGHT, ENOUGH ABOUT THE
OSCARS.

00:03:05.284 --> 00:03:06.886 line:91%
WHAT I REALLY WANT TO TALK ABOUT
TONIGHT ARE SOME RECENT COMMENTS

00:03:06.919 --> 00:03:09.488 size:75% position:38% line:85%
MADE BY AMERICA'S MAYOR.

00:03:09.521 --> 00:03:12.391 align:start position:0% line:85%
NO, NOT HIM.

00:03:12.424 --> 00:03:16.796 size:84% position:42% line:85%
THE ONE WITH A BIGGER HEAD.

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:18.297 align:start position:0% line:85%
YEAH, HIM.

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.132 align:start position:0% line:91%
LAST WEEK, WHILE SPEAKING AT A
FUNDRAISER FOR REPUBLICAN

00:03:20.165 --> 00:03:22.902 align:start position:0% line:91%
PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFUL SCOTT
WALKER, GIULIANI HAD THIS TO SAY

00:03:22.935 --> 00:03:25.838 align:start position:0% line:91%
ABOUT PRESIDENTIAL ACTUAL BARACK
OBAMA.

00:03:25.871 --> 00:03:28.407 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; GIULIANI TOUCHED OFF A
FIRESTORM WHEN HE SAID EARLIER

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.543 line:91%
THIS WEEK, "I KNOW THIS IS A
HORRIBLE THING TO SAY, BUT I DO

00:03:30.576 --> 00:03:32.545 align:start position:0% line:91%
NOT BELIEVE THAT THE PRESIDENT
LOVES AMERICA.

00:03:32.578 --> 00:03:34.180 align:start position:0% line:85%
HE DOESN'T LOVE YOU.

00:03:34.213 --> 00:03:36.182 size:78% position:39% line:85%
AND HE DOESN'T LOVE ME ."

00:03:36.215 --> 00:03:40.052 line:85%
&gt;&gt; LARRY:  HE DOESN'T LOVE YOU.

00:03:40.085 --> 00:03:45.057 align:start position:0% line:85%
HE DOESN'T LOVE ME.

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:45.992 align:start position:0% line:85%
HE DOESN'T LOVE YOU...

00:03:46.025 --> 00:03:50.830 align:start position:0% line:85%
HE LOVES ME!

00:03:50.863 --> 00:03:53.532 line:91%
SINCE WHEN DOES GIULIANI GET TO
DECLARE WHO LOVES THE COUNTRY?

00:03:53.565 --> 00:03:56.469 align:start position:0% line:91%
WHO PUT HIM IN CHARGE OF COUNTRY
LOVE?

00:03:56.502 --> 00:03:59.338 size:88% position:44% line:85%
ISN'T THAT TOBY KEITH'S JOB?

00:03:59.371 --> 00:04:04.577 align:start position:0% line:85%
OR LONNIE LYNN'S?

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:05.711 align:start position:0% line:85%
I'M SORRY.

00:04:05.744 --> 00:04:09.015 align:start position:0% line:91%
IT WAS JUST THE MOST SHOCKING
REVELATION OF THE NIGHT.

00:04:09.048 --> 00:04:10.950 align:start position:0% line:91%
BUT RUDY WASN'T DONE RIPPING
OBAMA.

00:04:10.983 --> 00:04:12.184 align:start position:0% line:85%
WHAT ELSE DID HE SAY?

00:04:12.218 --> 00:04:14.086 line:91%
&gt;&gt; HE WASN'T BROUGHT UP THE WAY
YOU WERE BROUGHT UP AND I WAS

00:04:14.119 --> 00:04:16.522 align:start position:0% line:91%
BROUGHT UP, THROUGH LOVE OF THIS
COUNTRY.

00:04:16.555 --> 00:04:19.425 line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: HE WASN'T BROUGHT UP
THROUGH LOVE OF THIS COUNTRY.

00:04:19.458 --> 00:04:23.629 line:91%
SO THAT MEANS HE WAS BROUGHT UP
THROUGH HATE OF THIS COUNTRY?

00:04:23.662 --> 00:04:26.699 align:start position:0% line:91%
MR. PRESIDENT, WHO HATE-RAISED
YOU?

00:04:26.732 --> 00:04:30.970 line:91%
&gt;&gt; I WAS RAISED WITH THE HELP OF
A WHITE GRANDFATHER WHO SURVIVED

00:04:31.003 --> 00:04:34.073 size:81% position:41% line:91%
A DEPRESSION TO SERVE IN
PATTON'S ARMY DURING WORLD

00:04:34.106 --> 00:04:37.743 line:91%
WAR II AND A WHITE GRANDMOTHER
WHO WORKED ON A BOMBER ASSEMBLY

00:04:37.776 --> 00:04:41.647 align:start position:0% line:91%
LINE IN FORT LEVENWORTH WHILE HE
WAS OVERSEAS.

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.350 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: W.W. DEUCE AND
FACTORIES?

00:04:44.383 --> 00:04:47.286 align:start position:0% line:91%
IT DOESN'T GET MORE "I LOVE
AMERICA" THAN THAT.

00:04:47.319 --> 00:04:49.488 align:start position:0% line:91%
UNLESS YOUR GRANDMA MADE
AMERICAN FLAGS WHILE WORKING IN

00:04:49.521 --> 00:04:53.092 align:start position:0% line:85%
AN APPLE PIE FACTORY.

00:04:53.125 --> 00:05:03.002 align:start position:0% line:91%
SO WHAT ELSE IS DIFFERENT ABOUT
OBAMA?

00:05:03.035 --> 00:05:06.005 align:start position:0% line:85%
MAN, I'M...

00:05:06.038 --> 00:05:06.405 align:start position:0% line:85%
MMM...

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:10.376 align:start position:0% line:85%
NO, NO, NO...

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:11.377 align:start position:0% line:85%
I'M...

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:13.179 align:start position:0% line:85%
NO, I'M...

00:05:13.212 --> 00:05:19.885 align:start position:0% line:91%
I'M REALLY TRYING MY BEST NOT TO
USE THE RACE CARD.

00:05:19.918 --> 00:05:23.656 align:start position:0% line:85%
GETTING DIFFICULT.

00:05:23.689 --> 00:05:25.424 align:start position:0% line:91%
NO, YOU KNOW, (BLEEP) THAT
(BLEEP).

00:05:25.457 --> 00:05:26.559 align:start position:0% line:85%
THAT'S RACIST.

00:05:26.592 --> 00:05:27.793 align:start position:0% line:85%
YES, THAT'S RIGHT.

00:05:27.826 --> 00:05:28.561 align:start position:0% line:85%
I USED THE RACE CARD.

00:05:28.594 --> 00:05:30.196 align:start position:0% line:85%
AND YOU KNOW WHY?

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:31.864 align:start position:0% line:91%
BECAUSE RUDY, WHEN YOU WERE
TRYING TO EXPLAIN YOURSELF, YOU

00:05:31.897 --> 00:05:35.000 align:start position:0% line:85%
USED THE 9/11 CARD.

00:05:35.033 --> 00:05:36.769 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, PRESIDENT OBAMA
DIDN'T LIVE THROUGH

00:05:36.802 --> 00:05:39.372 align:start position:0% line:85%
SEPTEMBER 11th.

00:05:39.405 --> 00:05:46.979 align:start position:0% line:85%
I DID.

00:05:47.012 --> 00:05:49.382 align:start position:0% line:91%
(BOOING)
&gt;&gt; Larry: THE PRESIDENT DIDN'T

00:05:49.415 --> 00:05:50.282 size:88% position:44% line:85%
LIVE THROUGH SEPTEMBER 11th?

00:05:50.315 --> 00:05:51.951 align:start position:0% line:91%
ARE YOU SAYING HE WAS BORN 13
YEARS AGO?

00:05:51.984 --> 00:05:55.388 align:start position:0% line:91%
IS THAT WHY THEY WANTED TO SEE
HIS BIRTH CERTIFICATE?

00:05:55.421 --> 00:05:58.557 line:91%
IT'S NOT THAT HE WAS BORN IN
KENYA, IT'S THAT HE WAS BORN IN

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:01.127 align:start position:0% line:85%
OCTOBER OF 2001?

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:02.928 align:start position:0% line:91%
I GUESS HOPE AND CHANGE MEANT
HOPING HIS VOICE WOULD CHANGE BY

00:06:02.961 --> 00:06:04.864 align:start position:0% line:85%
THE ELECTION.

00:06:04.897 --> 00:06:06.499 align:start position:0% line:85%
RUDY, I'M SORRY.

00:06:06.532 --> 00:06:07.867 align:start position:0% line:91%
I DIDN'T MEAN TO CUT OFF THE
DEFENSE OF YOUR RACIST

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:08.367 align:start position:0% line:85%
STATEMENT.

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.236 align:start position:0% line:85%
PLEASE CONTINUE.

00:06:10.269 --> 00:06:13.239 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, PRESIDENT OBAMA
DIDN'T LIVE THROUGH

00:06:13.272 --> 00:06:15.408 align:start position:0% line:85%
SEPTEMBER 11 -- I DID.

00:06:15.441 --> 00:06:18.210 line:91%
PRESIDENT OBAMA DIDN'T ALMOST,
YOU KNOW, HAVE A BUILDING FALL

00:06:18.243 --> 00:06:20.780 align:start position:0% line:91%
ON HIM -- MYSELF AND MY POLICE
COMMISSIONER AND MY FIRE

00:06:20.813 --> 00:06:23.916 align:start position:0% line:85%
COMMISSIONER DID.

00:06:23.949 --> 00:06:27.920 size:75% position:38% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: ARE YOU DRUNK?

00:06:27.953 --> 00:06:31.490 align:start position:0% line:91%
EVERY AMERICAN LIVED THROUGH
9/11.

00:06:31.523 --> 00:06:33.959 line:91%
NOT JUST AMERICA, BUT MOST OF
THE WORLD CAME TOGETHER AFTER

00:06:33.992 --> 00:06:35.193 align:start position:0% line:85%
THAT HAPPENED.

00:06:35.227 --> 00:06:37.696 align:start position:0% line:91%
IN FACT, IT WAS SUCH A POWERFUL,
INTOXICATING EVENT THAT FOR A

00:06:37.729 --> 00:06:40.065 size:81% position:41% line:91%
BRIEF, SHINING MOMENT, THE
ENTIRE WORLD FORGOT WHAT A

00:06:40.098 --> 00:06:45.571 align:start position:0% line:85%
COLOSSAL PRICK YOU ARE.

00:06:45.604 --> 00:06:47.406 align:start position:0% line:85%
THAT'S HOW BIG IT WAS.

00:06:47.439 --> 00:06:48.874 align:start position:0% line:85%
IT WAS HUGE!

00:06:48.907 --> 00:06:52.778 align:start position:0% line:91%
(APPLAUSE)
IT WAS HUGE.

00:06:52.811 --> 00:06:54.680 line:91%
NOW THAT GIULIANI HAS GOTTEN SO
MUCH HEAT, HE'S BACKPEDALING

00:06:54.713 --> 00:06:58.751 align:start position:0% line:91%
LIKE A RUSSIAN BEAR ON A BICYCLE
AT THE CIRCUS.

00:06:58.784 --> 00:07:04.089 size:84% position:42% line:85%
HE WROTE AN OP-ED SAYING...

00:07:04.122 --> 00:07:05.858 line:91%

THAT THE PRESIDENT DOESN'T LOVE

00:07:05.891 --> 00:07:07.593 size:81% position:41% line:91%
AMERICA NOTWITHSTANDING, I
DIDN'T INTEND TO QUESTION

00:07:07.626 --> 00:07:14.533 align:start position:0% line:91%
PRESIDENT OBAMA'S MOTIVES OR THE
CONTENT OF HIS HEART.

00:07:14.566 --> 00:07:17.470 align:start position:0% line:91%
(AUDIENCE BOOING)
