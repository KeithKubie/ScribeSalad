00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:32.410
- Welcome to a conversation with history.

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:33.490
I'm Harry Kreisler

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:35.610
of the Institute of International Studies.

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.370
Our guest is Professor
Gananath Obeyesekere,

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.880
who is professor of anthropology

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.930
emeritus at Princeton University.

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.430
One of the world's
leading anthropologists,

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:50.585
he is visiting the campus

00:00:50.585 --> 00:00:55.440
as the Foerster Lecturer
for the year 2003.

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:59.020
He is the author, most recently,

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:03.810
of Imagining Karma, published by UC Press.

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.580
Professor, welcome to Berkeley.

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:07.910
- Glad to be here.

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:09.930
- Where were you born and raised?

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.633
- Well I born in Sri Lanka
and also raised there.

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.170
That's where I had my early education

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:22.170
and my university education,
at least for my BA.

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:24.670
- And looking back, how do you think

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.763
your parents shaped your
thinking about the world?

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.660
- Well, my father was a kind of,

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:37.080
for that time, a kind
of cosmopolitan figure.

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.299
I mean, he was born in a small village

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:44.403
in the south of Sri Lanka, as I was too,

00:01:44.403 --> 00:01:47.456
and as a young man he went to India

00:01:47.456 --> 00:01:52.456
and he studied both Ayurvedic
and Western medicine,

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:57.500
but got his degree in classical Ayurveda,

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.450
that is, Indian medicine.

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.660
And then he came back to Sri
Lanka and he taught there.

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.970
So actually, he was fluent in about

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.883
three or four languages,
including English,

00:02:11.423 --> 00:02:14.436
and we had a sense of a kind of

00:02:14.436 --> 00:02:18.400
a broad education as
a consequence of that.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.650
- So you were exposed to many cultures,

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.023
in a way, very early.

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.790
- Well, in a sense I was
exposed to many cultures,

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.130
because I spanned the whole
colonial era, to some degree.

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.370
I mean I was born in the colonial period

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.850
and I lived through the
period of independence

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:38.800
and freedom and so forth.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.450
So in that sense I was exposed to

00:02:42.824 --> 00:02:46.851
the colonial epoch, so to speak.

00:02:46.851 --> 00:02:49.420
And since my father knew English

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.900
and Sanskrit and Hindi
and Sinhala and so forth,

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.393
I was exposed to a wide range
of languages, I would say.

00:02:58.393 --> 00:03:03.223
My father was interested in
Sanskrit or Indian medicine,

00:03:03.223 --> 00:03:05.240
and for that matter I have written

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.437
some articles on it too,

00:03:07.437 --> 00:03:10.803
so there is continuity, one might say.

00:03:12.055 --> 00:03:13.650
- And how old were you at the time

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.313
of the struggle for independence?

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.450
- Well, Sri Lanka was in a
fortunate situation where,

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.720
maybe it was an unfortunate one,

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.810
we didn't have to actually
struggle for independence.

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:28.550
The Indians did all the struggling

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:31.130
and we sort of had it
on a plate, you know.

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:36.130
So this was, I might
have been, I don't know,

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.700
15 or so when that happened.

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:43.880
- Was there an effect on you?

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.623
Or did it just, the world
changed just one day.

00:03:48.525 --> 00:03:49.731
- Not at all.

00:03:49.731 --> 00:03:51.740
I mean, it did have an effect on me.

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:54.550
During the war years, for example,

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:57.203
this was, we got
independence after the war,

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:01.451
and during the war years, my education

00:04:01.451 --> 00:04:05.180
was disrupted, you
might say, in one sense,

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.343
or enhanced if you want to
say it in another sense.

00:04:07.343 --> 00:04:10.920
Because we had to move from
school to school and so forth.

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.120
And that, looking back on it, you know,

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.680
I found that a good experience.

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.160
It was sort of a broadening of my mind

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.423
going from one place to another.

00:04:26.424 --> 00:04:27.551
- And was this all in your home country?

00:04:27.551 --> 00:04:29.793
- It's in my home country, yeah.

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:33.690
- So you did what we could call

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:37.147
the undergraduate education in Sri Lanka.

00:04:37.147 --> 00:04:39.120
Is that when you got interested

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.093
in anthropology, or was it later?

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:47.610
- Well actually, I mean if I
could switch back a little bit,

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:50.443
I was a terrible high school student.

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.306
And I always tell my children,

00:04:53.306 --> 00:04:56.234
all you learn in high school you can

00:04:56.234 --> 00:05:00.240
pick it up in six months later on.

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.130
But fortunately, I
managed to get through my,

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:07.600
one might say scraped through
my university entrance exam.

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.180
But when I went into the university,

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:13.416
I think, that was a wonderful experience.

00:05:13.416 --> 00:05:17.230
And I moved into English literature.

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:19.503
That was my major, you see.

00:05:20.826 --> 00:05:24.600
So this was a period in
European intellectual thought

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:29.070
where there was a
certain amount of ferment

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:31.073
with the new criticism coming in,

00:05:32.132 --> 00:05:35.480
you know, in England in
Cambridge and Oxford.

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:36.923
In Cambridge in particular,

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:41.410
you had a great literary
critic, F.R. Leavis, you see.

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:46.410
And our teachers were
students of F.R. Leavis,

00:05:46.836 --> 00:05:49.193
so we were sort of, one might say,

00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:53.420
educated in, at that
time, the most powerful

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:56.900
sort of literary critical
movement of the time.

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:01.900
And it was through my literary education,

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:08.160
and though we called it English literature

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:12.770
we read a heck of a lot
of European literature,

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:16.060
Ibsen, French literature, and so forth,

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:18.763
so it was broadly compiled, one might say.

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.770
But this was a time, after all, people,

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:25.680
Eliot was writing The Waste Land

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:28.320
and people were talking on mythmaking.

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:30.260
You know, even in my lecture yesterday

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.130
I was talking of Yeats, who was,

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:35.850
in some sense, a great mythmaker.

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:40.850
So I think I got very
interested in anthropology

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.300
through this bizarre source,

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:47.040
through literature, through Frazer.

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:51.520
Because remember, Eliot used
Frazer and Weston and so forth,

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:53.750
people we hardly read nowadays,

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:57.823
but that's the way I got
interested in anthropology.

00:07:00.733 --> 00:07:03.010
And also through collections.

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:06.110
This was a period in which
people were collecting

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:09.580
Scottish ballads, you know, and so forth.

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:13.758
So I was infected with this kind of

00:07:13.758 --> 00:07:17.069
early romanticism, one might say.

00:07:17.069 --> 00:07:19.700
So during weekends, what I did was

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:24.700
I used to take a train
ride into a distant place,

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:29.453
get off the train, wander
into villages and so forth,

00:07:29.453 --> 00:07:32.470
go into a Buddhist temple,
stay the night there,

00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:36.430
chat with people, and I
used to collect folk songs.

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:37.700
You see?

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:40.440
And still could rattle
off hundreds and hundreds

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:44.221
of Sri Lankan Sinhalese folk songs.

00:07:44.221 --> 00:07:49.010
But that gradually drew
me into village life.

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:52.470
So very early, as an undergraduate,

00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:54.550
several of us started a journal

00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:58.090
which was called Sanskruti, in Sinhala.

00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:01.190
And Sanskruti means a culture.

00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:06.128
So you can see, culture in
a sort of Arnoldian sense,

00:08:06.128 --> 00:08:09.320
or T.S. Eliot sense of culture, you know?

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:11.830
But that sense of culture, in some sense,

00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:14.080
drew me into anthropology,

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:16.930
particularly the village experience,

00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:19.143
collecting folk material.

00:08:20.122 --> 00:08:25.122
And also a kind of romantic
looking back at my own past,

00:08:25.951 --> 00:08:27.463
because I was born in a village,

00:08:28.349 --> 00:08:30.960
at age four we went to
the city of Colombo,

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:33.718
the only big city, then as well as now,

00:08:33.718 --> 00:08:38.718
and went into sort of private
schools, what you might call.

00:08:40.306 --> 00:08:44.050
So in some sense I was trying
to look back into my past.

00:08:44.050 --> 00:08:49.043
And I would say that, in a sense,

00:08:49.043 --> 00:08:52.230
virtually everything I wrote

00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:55.763
is in some sense a
reflection of Sri Lanka.

00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:59.220
My own past, my own history,

00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:01.070
as well as the history of the nation.

00:09:01.918 --> 00:09:04.124
Even when I'm writing something,

00:09:04.124 --> 00:09:05.353
let us say, on Captain Cook.

00:09:06.846 --> 00:09:09.340
- And what would you describe as your

00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:11.650
intellectual and emotional stance

00:09:11.650 --> 00:09:13.793
toward what you were doing?

00:09:13.793 --> 00:09:16.740
Was the motivation to preserve?

00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:19.711
To understand the complexity?

00:09:19.711 --> 00:09:20.961
Or these things and more.

00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:24.150
- In my early forays?

00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:25.003
- Yeah, yeah.

00:09:25.968 --> 00:09:28.190
- In my early forays, it was,

00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:32.194
I'm ashamed to confess,
it was almost antiquarian.

00:09:32.194 --> 00:09:35.210
I mean, it's a horrible term to use,

00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:38.210
but in a sense I was trying
to collect these things

00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:41.726
because you're first,
you were first confronted

00:09:41.726 --> 00:09:46.100
with the impact of modernity
in the country, after all.

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:49.423
And we felt that something
is going to get lost.

00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:53.740
And I presume that's the same motivation

00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:58.291
that let Alfred Lord and
other collectors, you know,

00:09:58.291 --> 00:10:02.593
to deal with European ballads
and epics and so forth.

00:10:03.803 --> 00:10:07.793
That was the spur that
led me in my early years.

00:10:09.771 --> 00:10:12.021
- And then your graduate
education was where?

00:10:14.325 --> 00:10:19.200
- Well, when I graduated from
the University of Sri Lanka,

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:23.110
one of my professors, who
was really a student of,

00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:25.690
as I pointed out, of F.R. Leavis,

00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:30.270
he said, why don't you join
the English department,

00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:33.960
which was probably the most
prestigious department,

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:36.223
you know, given the colonial period.

00:10:38.612 --> 00:10:39.445
And I refused.

00:10:40.549 --> 00:10:42.500
And he sort of said,
that's nice, you know,

00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:43.580
you're one of the first people

00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:45.130
who refused this kind of thing.

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:51.760
And I got a, I applied, I
got several scholarships.

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:55.360
I mean I could have gone
to London or to Oxford,

00:10:55.360 --> 00:11:00.360
because I headed the list
of graduating students,

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:04.920
so I had automatic scholarships
to go to London or Oxford.

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:08.880
But I had a sneaking
sort of anticolonialism,

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:11.523
which I still have, sneaking kind of way.

00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:16.240
And I refused to go the way of others.

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:18.510
Almost everyone else, all the sort of,

00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:20.730
you might say, the left
wing leader of Sri Lanka

00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:23.949
all went to London or Oxford or Cambridge.

00:11:23.949 --> 00:11:26.380
But I thought that's not my way,

00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:30.470
and I went, I applied for a Fulbright.

00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:31.720
Everyone was horrified.

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:34.460
My father was horrified.

00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:36.240
You're going to America?

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:39.663
I mean, this is some
sort of terrible thing,

00:11:40.511 --> 00:11:42.580
instead of going to Oxford or Cambridge.

00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:46.440
So I got this Fulbright and I went.

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:50.993
I applied to Harvard,
Chicago, Princeton, Yale,

00:11:52.458 --> 00:11:53.893
and I got into the University
of Washington in Seattle.

00:11:55.444 --> 00:11:57.620
So that's how I first went there.

00:11:57.620 --> 00:12:00.740
But in between, in between there was

00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:03.698
a sort of liminal period, one might say,

00:12:03.698 --> 00:12:06.400
a couple of years after I graduated

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:10.410
and before taking up my Fulbright.

00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:12.210
And I had to have a project

00:12:12.210 --> 00:12:17.000
so I started working on some
very interesting rituals,

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.220
particularly mother
goddess cults in Sri Lanka.

00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:23.050
And since I was a Frazerian at that time,

00:12:23.050 --> 00:12:25.730
I had no idea that one
should go to a village

00:12:25.730 --> 00:12:28.040
and stay their for a whole year

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:30.860
and study the village
throughout its early cycle.

00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:34.340
That was an anthropological
model of which I was not aware.

00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:36.770
I was aware of the Frazerian model

00:12:36.770 --> 00:12:38.130
where you went all over the place.

00:12:38.130 --> 00:12:43.130
So at that time I had a
terribly old tape recorder

00:12:44.410 --> 00:12:48.785
and a huge battery and converter,

00:12:48.785 --> 00:12:51.370
and went from place to place

00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:55.560
in military trucks
abandoned by the British,

00:12:55.560 --> 00:13:00.302
and went recording these
mother goddess cults

00:13:00.302 --> 00:13:03.900
all over the country, you know?

00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:07.930
On reflection, I thought,
what a haul this was.

00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:09.513
I would never have done that.

00:13:10.761 --> 00:13:13.510
I would never have got
this massive haul of data

00:13:14.691 --> 00:13:16.170
if I followed the conventional
anthropological model.

00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:20.352
And I used some of the
material for my masters

00:13:20.352 --> 00:13:24.160
and then, later on, I
used that for my work

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:26.920
on the cult of the goddess Pattini,

00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:30.113
which is a kind of comparative
study of a single cult,

00:13:31.253 --> 00:13:34.123
intensive cult all over Sri
Lanka and in South India.

00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:40.010
- Help us understand what it takes

00:13:40.010 --> 00:13:44.673
to be an anthropologist and do that work.

00:13:45.645 --> 00:13:47.630
What are the talents and skills

00:13:47.630 --> 00:13:50.060
that a student should understand

00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:55.173
that are necessary for
being an anthropologist?

00:13:56.310 --> 00:14:01.197
- Well, I hate to
pontificate on this issue,

00:14:01.197 --> 00:14:02.840
because it seems to me
that different people

00:14:04.709 --> 00:14:08.270
have different sort of
stances on this whole thing.

00:14:08.270 --> 00:14:10.710
My own guess, coming
from my own experience,

00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:15.443
is somewhat different from the
conventional anthropologists.

00:14:16.430 --> 00:14:20.520
After all, the normal
anthropologist, you might say,

00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:24.110
is someone who is either in Europe

00:14:24.110 --> 00:14:26.320
or in France or in England,

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:29.711
studying another culture which he,

00:14:29.711 --> 00:14:32.993
he was not nurtured or socialized in.

00:14:34.169 --> 00:14:37.039
In my case, this was entirely different.

00:14:37.039 --> 00:14:41.920
And I was studying, in
some sense, my own culture,

00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:46.900
but through the prism of an
anthropological detachment,

00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:51.223
one my say, which was, to
me, necessary at the time.

00:14:52.838 --> 00:14:57.610
So I would say that it
was not all that different

00:14:57.610 --> 00:15:01.340
from normal anthropology, in some sense,

00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:03.973
because I was raised, I
was born in a village,

00:15:04.954 --> 00:15:07.164
I was raised in an urban situation,

00:15:07.164 --> 00:15:10.164
I went to schools in which the
primary language was English.

00:15:11.669 --> 00:15:16.260
We were discouraged to speak
our own language, Sinhala,

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:18.723
by our English teachers.

00:15:20.555 --> 00:15:23.420
So, going back to study villages was,

00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:27.070
in a sense, to understand my own culture,

00:15:27.070 --> 00:15:32.070
which is not quite the thrust
of conventional anthropology.

00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:36.320
But on the other hand, the
villages in which I worked

00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:41.320
were, in a sense, sort of
different from my urban lifestyle,

00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:45.460
my urban education, my
middle class background,

00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:49.283
the fact that, for the most
part, I spoke English at home.

00:15:51.665 --> 00:15:54.690
- But then later, I mean, did you remain

00:15:54.690 --> 00:15:57.453
the same kind of anthropologist
in your later work?

00:15:58.510 --> 00:16:03.510
Or were you beyond acquiring
the professional skills,

00:16:03.717 --> 00:16:05.663
obviously, that your
graduate education gave.

00:16:06.641 --> 00:16:09.041
How much is changed in
the way you do your work?

00:16:11.198 --> 00:16:15.900
- I think, I haven't reflected on this,

00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:18.298
I have to wait 'til I
write my memoirs I guess.

00:16:18.298 --> 00:16:19.843
- This'll be the beginning.

00:16:19.843 --> 00:16:21.543
- To deal with this kind of thing.

00:16:23.181 --> 00:16:27.790
But sure, certainly I've
changed quite a lot,

00:16:27.790 --> 00:16:30.263
I assume, over the intervening years.

00:16:31.948 --> 00:16:34.343
But in one sense, I really believe,

00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:37.453
when we were graduate students,

00:16:38.467 --> 00:16:42.500
we were, in a sense,
sometimes taught explicitly,

00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:45.990
sometimes implicitly, that it won't do

00:16:45.990 --> 00:16:49.442
to study one's own culture, you know?

00:16:49.442 --> 00:16:52.693
I don't believe in that at all.

00:16:53.566 --> 00:16:58.440
I mean, I think that to
study one's own culture

00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:02.133
is not a bad idea through a
kind of anthropological lens,

00:17:04.065 --> 00:17:06.516
with a certain amount of detachment.

00:17:06.516 --> 00:17:09.656
And I see this coming back
in full circle right now,

00:17:09.656 --> 00:17:12.461
where I have my own
students in Princeton now

00:17:12.461 --> 00:17:15.403
going to study their
own cultures, you see,

00:17:15.403 --> 00:17:19.340
in a sense, either American culture

00:17:19.340 --> 00:17:21.773
or European culture, and so forth.

00:17:24.582 --> 00:17:27.583
So I would say that doing anthropology

00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:31.755
has certainly expanded my consciousness

00:17:31.755 --> 00:17:33.855
to a certain degree, broadened my outlook.

00:17:35.076 --> 00:17:40.076
I'm in a sense, you know, a
cosmopolitan being, in some way,

00:17:41.890 --> 00:17:44.860
and that's due to my
anthropological education.

00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:49.860
- And which theories and theorists
have influenced you most?

00:17:50.270 --> 00:17:53.653
Obviously parts of Freud's work,

00:17:54.709 --> 00:17:59.152
even criticizing it is one thing.

00:17:59.152 --> 00:18:02.080
Who else, and tell us a little bit

00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:03.883
about Freud's influence on you.

00:18:05.230 --> 00:18:09.370
- Well Freud's influence was, again,

00:18:09.370 --> 00:18:13.310
came through my literary interests.

00:18:13.310 --> 00:18:16.300
I mean, after all, Freud was a figure

00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:19.790
of the literary imagination, I would say,

00:18:19.790 --> 00:18:21.160
even before he was a product

00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:23.253
of the anthropological imagination.

00:18:24.321 --> 00:18:25.910
People interested in literature

00:18:25.910 --> 00:18:27.160
were also interested in Freud

00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:30.250
as they were interested in Frazer.

00:18:30.250 --> 00:18:32.400
I read Freud when I was an undergraduate.

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:35.100
I read Finnegan's Wake when
I was an undergraduate.

00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:37.820
You know, in high school I read Ulysses.

00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:42.560
So we had a tremendous education
in European literature.

00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:44.713
And that included people like Freud.

00:18:46.370 --> 00:18:48.290
Not that I understood Freud very much,

00:18:48.290 --> 00:18:53.290
but through Freud, you know,

00:18:53.675 --> 00:18:56.560
I began to understand something

00:18:56.560 --> 00:18:59.596
I mentioned in my lecture last time,

00:18:59.596 --> 00:19:04.596
that the Sri Lankan Oedipus
is like the Greek one.

00:19:05.471 --> 00:19:08.880
So through Freud I began to understand

00:19:10.044 --> 00:19:15.044
my own background, my own
situation in Sri Lanka.

00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:20.953
I was a great rebel as a young man.

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:26.008
I used to almost never stay at home,

00:19:26.008 --> 00:19:29.553
wander out in villages
even as a young person.

00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:33.070
And Freud helped me to understand

00:19:33.070 --> 00:19:38.070
my own rebellious Oedipal
kinds of feelings.

00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:41.170
So in that sense, Freud was not

00:19:41.170 --> 00:19:46.170
simply a kind of intellectual
mentor, one might say,

00:19:46.630 --> 00:19:48.640
but also someone who helped me

00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:51.093
to understand my own emotional conflicts.

00:19:52.433 --> 00:19:54.533
One might as well state the truth of that.

00:19:56.770 --> 00:20:00.470
And when I, in my early work, therefore,

00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:04.260
I tried to bring Freud into the picture.

00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:07.520
And the University of
Washington helped me a lot,

00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:10.550
because at that time, in anthropology,

00:20:10.550 --> 00:20:11.750
when I first went there,

00:20:12.727 --> 00:20:15.140
there was an anthropologist,
Melville Jacobs,

00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:16.340
who was very much interested

00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:18.483
in the American Indians and Freud.

00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:22.740
And Jacobs was really a
very imaginative writer

00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:26.380
and very few people actually read him now.

00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:30.804
And I went for classes
in the medical school

00:20:30.804 --> 00:20:33.170
at the University of Washington,

00:20:33.170 --> 00:20:38.170
and Gert Heilbrunn, who was
a kind of Viennese emigre,

00:20:38.410 --> 00:20:41.480
was a Freudian, very
standard kind of Freudian,

00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:44.070
and a charismatic kind of teacher,

00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:47.320
so I learned a heck of a lot from him.

00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:50.380
And after, or while, Mel Spiro,

00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:53.430
whom I mentioned in my
class, also came in,

00:20:53.430 --> 00:20:55.890
but that was during the latter part

00:20:55.890 --> 00:20:58.390
of my stay in the
University of Washington,

00:20:58.390 --> 00:21:01.963
when I was doing my PhD, you know.

00:21:03.423 --> 00:21:07.100
Mel was a very strong influence

00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:10.520
and encouraged me in
the Freudian direction.

00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:13.960
And I like Freud for other reasons too.

00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:15.433
He was a wonderful writer.

00:21:16.304 --> 00:21:18.910
You know, as Thomas Mann
put it, he was a stylist.

00:21:18.910 --> 00:21:20.683
Even in English translation.

00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:27.520
- Other theorists that
emerge as important,

00:21:28.130 --> 00:21:30.740
either in your development or later,

00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:32.390
as people who you duel with

00:21:32.390 --> 00:21:35.500
as you achieve stature in the field?

00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:38.560
- Yeah, along with Freud, you see,

00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:41.740
was my interest in Weber.

00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:42.940
That came in much later.

00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:49.760
And my PhD dissertation
was not at all Freudian.

00:21:50.506 --> 00:21:54.440
Simply, I mean this was perhaps a sign

00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:59.256
of perversity on my part, or
tactfulness, you might say,

00:21:59.256 --> 00:22:03.540
that the dominant paradigm at that time,

00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:05.460
when I was at the
university of Washington,

00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:07.980
was British social anthropology.

00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:11.613
And British social anthropology
was very anti-Freudian.

00:22:12.841 --> 00:22:15.320
American anthropology was very

00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:17.783
sympathetic to Freud, as you well know.

00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:22.750
But not British anthropology.

00:22:22.750 --> 00:22:25.520
So British anthropology was very much

00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:27.801
interested in social structure,

00:22:27.801 --> 00:22:31.890
the study of kinship systems and so forth.

00:22:31.890 --> 00:22:34.881
So my first foray into

00:22:34.881 --> 00:22:38.923
conventional anthropological
fieldwork, you know,

00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:43.884
where you spend some time
in a particular village,

00:22:43.884 --> 00:22:47.350
was a study of kinship and land tenure

00:22:47.350 --> 00:22:49.600
in a remote village in Sri Lanka.

00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:51.963
And there I brought in Max Weber.

00:22:53.370 --> 00:22:56.770
Weber became a very powerful
influence at that time,

00:22:56.770 --> 00:23:00.510
and later on I began to
read a lot more of Weber,

00:23:00.510 --> 00:23:05.510
and I saw a kind of emotional affinity

00:23:05.738 --> 00:23:10.738
to my own interests, intellectual
affinity I would say.

00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:15.690
I mean, Freud was more emotional affinity.

00:23:15.690 --> 00:23:19.540
And one of my interests at that time

00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:22.380
was to use Weberian ideas of culture,

00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:25.970
you know, as a kind of system of meanings

00:23:25.970 --> 00:23:28.960
by which human beings
related to the world.

00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:31.690
And also in some way a
Weberian methodology,

00:23:31.690 --> 00:23:33.290
the notion of ideal types,

00:23:33.290 --> 00:23:37.075
which again I resurrected
back in my most recent work.

00:23:37.075 --> 00:23:40.453
So Weber and Freud became the sort of,

00:23:40.453 --> 00:23:43.820
the foundations, one might say,

00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:48.000
of the beginning of my
anthropological career,

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.580
and thus they are there to some extent,

00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:55.030
even though I have transformed
Weber through Wittgenstein

00:23:55.030 --> 00:23:57.283
and various other influences in my life.

00:23:58.961 --> 00:24:02.222
- And any other theorists
that we should mention?

00:24:02.222 --> 00:24:04.620
- Yeah, there are many other theorists

00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:08.390
that I was interested in.

00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:10.710
Evans-Pritchard, for example.

00:24:10.710 --> 00:24:13.839
Because Evans-Pritchard, from a long time,

00:24:13.839 --> 00:24:18.839
presented an idea to which
I was highly sympathetic,

00:24:19.335 --> 00:24:24.335
namely, that anthropology
is history in some sense.

00:24:26.170 --> 00:24:31.170
And to this day I feel
that, however much you know,

00:24:31.874 --> 00:24:36.874
positivism has impinged on
anthropology very early.

00:24:38.036 --> 00:24:40.470
At that time, my first book was called

00:24:40.470 --> 00:24:42.083
Land Tenure In Village Ceylon:

00:24:43.194 --> 00:24:45.800
a Sociological and Historical Study.

00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:48.382
So history became a very very

00:24:48.382 --> 00:24:52.023
crucial element in my own thinking.

00:24:52.023 --> 00:24:55.030
And in a sense, that's natural, isn't it?

00:24:55.030 --> 00:24:56.490
I mean after all I am a Sri Lankan,

00:24:56.490 --> 00:24:59.738
though I am an American citizen too,

00:24:59.738 --> 00:25:02.640
I am a Sri Lankan born and raised,

00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:07.237
and to me, getting
interested in my own past

00:25:07.237 --> 00:25:09.753
was very very relevant.

00:25:10.744 --> 00:25:13.670
So through Evans-Pritchard
and other thinkers

00:25:13.670 --> 00:25:16.930
of that same sort, I
became very much interested

00:25:16.930 --> 00:25:21.930
in history, and that's
not alien to Weber either.

00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:26.410
- And what I'm hearing you say is that

00:25:26.410 --> 00:25:29.020
at the core of your work

00:25:29.020 --> 00:25:33.044
is an interdisciplinary sensitivity,

00:25:33.044 --> 00:25:37.420
that your work as an anthropologist

00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:41.260
really reflects all sorts of sources

00:25:44.050 --> 00:25:46.820
in terms of the influence of theory,

00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:49.570
from, Weber was a sociologist obviously,

00:25:49.570 --> 00:25:51.680
Freud was a psychologist, and so on.

00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:55.260
And that is kind of enriching for you

00:25:55.260 --> 00:25:57.450
as you do your anthropology.

00:25:57.450 --> 00:25:58.840
- Yes, indeed it is.

00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:00.590
As a matter of fact, some of my,

00:26:00.590 --> 00:26:02.864
I would add to that and say that

00:26:02.864 --> 00:26:06.274
right through my literary
interests are there.

00:26:06.274 --> 00:26:09.270
In a sense, I am glad that I am

00:26:09.270 --> 00:26:11.860
not a professor English literature.

00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:13.996
I'd rather read literature for fun.

00:26:13.996 --> 00:26:18.580
And to some extent, literary writing,

00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:22.401
and I don't know, I try to write well,

00:26:22.401 --> 00:26:26.450
and literature has been
a real passion for me,

00:26:26.450 --> 00:26:27.840
a personal passion.

00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:30.660
When I have my shower,
I can quote, you know,

00:26:30.660 --> 00:26:32.490
reams and reams of poetry.

00:26:32.490 --> 00:26:34.199
I mean I still can.

00:26:34.199 --> 00:26:37.136
And storytelling, you know,

00:26:37.136 --> 00:26:39.598
has become a part of my interests,

00:26:39.598 --> 00:26:44.598
particularly my recent work
on what I call cannibal talk.

00:26:44.967 --> 00:26:48.420
I'm very much interested in
how people invent stories,

00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:50.790
what I call narratives of the self.

00:26:50.790 --> 00:26:54.120
So storytelling, which after all

00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:57.198
is something I was nurtured as a child,

00:26:57.198 --> 00:27:00.902
you know, in Sri Lanka
everyone tells stories,

00:27:00.902 --> 00:27:05.902
the women who brought
me up told me stories,

00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:10.950
Buddhist stories, then
in my intellectual career

00:27:10.950 --> 00:27:14.540
I was reading novels,
fiction, poetry, and so forth,

00:27:14.540 --> 00:27:19.540
so storytelling too is a part
of my intellectual baggage.

00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:24.740
- You must have been
positioned to the ways in which

00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:32.350
Western social theory
could get things wrong

00:27:32.350 --> 00:27:36.336
because of a lack of
empathy or understanding

00:27:36.336 --> 00:27:40.360
with the setting where the
problem was being studied.

00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:42.170
Tell us a little about that

00:27:42.170 --> 00:27:44.810
and how you dealt with those tensions

00:27:44.810 --> 00:27:47.780
and how you came to
realizations like that.

00:27:47.780 --> 00:27:51.060
- You know, again, it's a sort of

00:27:51.060 --> 00:27:53.540
difficult question to answer

00:27:53.540 --> 00:27:57.530
because it permeates my
work to such a degree.

00:27:57.530 --> 00:27:59.775
I would say it cuts both ways.

00:27:59.775 --> 00:28:03.379
On the one hand, I am very critical

00:28:03.379 --> 00:28:07.674
of the way sort of, you know,

00:28:07.674 --> 00:28:12.190
European scholarship approaches the other.

00:28:12.190 --> 00:28:15.480
You know, third world
cultures including my own.

00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:17.073
I'm very critical of that way.

00:28:18.448 --> 00:28:22.273
And also critical of my own culture.

00:28:25.819 --> 00:28:30.030
I am terribly unpopular in
Sri Lanka in some sense,

00:28:30.030 --> 00:28:32.530
at least among small groups of people,

00:28:32.530 --> 00:28:33.770
because I am very critical

00:28:33.770 --> 00:28:37.059
of the nationalism in the country,

00:28:37.059 --> 00:28:39.200
the nationalism that led to this

00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:40.910
sort of terrifying war in which

00:28:40.910 --> 00:28:44.130
we are now implicated and fortunately

00:28:44.130 --> 00:28:47.310
having a breathing spell right now.

00:28:47.310 --> 00:28:52.310
So I am both critical of the
Western attitude to the other

00:28:54.980 --> 00:28:59.022
as well as our attitude to the West

00:28:59.022 --> 00:29:02.548
and trying to pretend that colonialism,

00:29:02.548 --> 00:29:05.440
for example, some extreme nationalists say

00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:07.872
colonialism has had no impact on us,

00:29:07.872 --> 00:29:11.850
we have the same Buddhist
culture going right through.

00:29:11.850 --> 00:29:13.370
When I try to point out,

00:29:13.370 --> 00:29:16.865
in several of my works
including Buddhism Transformed

00:29:16.865 --> 00:29:20.607
and in this book, you
see that in some sense

00:29:20.607 --> 00:29:23.173
the Buddhism that we now believe in

00:29:23.173 --> 00:29:25.860
is a colonial product, you see.

00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:29.058
It is a product of Western theorists

00:29:29.058 --> 00:29:31.810
and translators of Buddhists texts

00:29:31.810 --> 00:29:33.809
who came in the 19th Century.

00:29:33.809 --> 00:29:37.730
And I'm not saying that's
necessarily bad, you know,

00:29:37.730 --> 00:29:40.150
but it led to a transformation of ethics,

00:29:40.150 --> 00:29:41.420
the transformation of the way

00:29:41.420 --> 00:29:43.580
we look at the world in Sri Lanka.

00:29:43.580 --> 00:29:46.690
And it is foolish to deny
this colonial impact.

00:29:46.690 --> 00:29:48.870
I am a product of that too, myself.

00:29:48.870 --> 00:29:51.940
You know, as I sit with
you, speaking English,

00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:53.789
trained in English literature.

00:29:53.789 --> 00:29:56.715
And so forth, so why deny this?

00:29:56.715 --> 00:30:00.242
At the same time, I don't want to sort of,

00:30:00.242 --> 00:30:05.242
sort of whitewash the colonial enterprise.

00:30:05.324 --> 00:30:10.150
In a lot of my work, the work
on Captain Cook for example,

00:30:10.150 --> 00:30:13.880
and the work I'm now doing
on what I call cannibal talk,

00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:17.273
is the way the European
looks at the other.

00:30:18.540 --> 00:30:20.840
And Cannibal Talk, when it appears,

00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:23.740
I hope it appears soon,
will deal with that issue.

00:30:23.740 --> 00:30:25.653
So is the Cook book, you see.

00:30:26.622 --> 00:30:28.360
- Tell us a little bit
about the Cook book.

00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:30.890
Because I know it's
really an important work.

00:30:30.890 --> 00:30:33.540
- Well the Cook book, in some sense,

00:30:33.540 --> 00:30:36.660
was an attempt to be critical,

00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:40.440
all this time I've been
critical of my own country

00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:43.863
and the way they have framed
Buddhism and so forth.

00:30:45.189 --> 00:30:49.027
With the Cook book, I move into a kind of

00:30:49.027 --> 00:30:51.056
critique of the way in which

00:30:51.056 --> 00:30:54.460
European scholarship
has looked on the other,

00:30:54.460 --> 00:30:57.250
you know, third world people and so forth.

00:30:57.250 --> 00:31:00.739
The Cook book really
deals with the phenomenon

00:31:00.739 --> 00:31:05.202
of this great explorer, Captain Cook,

00:31:05.202 --> 00:31:08.580
who then goes into, at that time,

00:31:08.580 --> 00:31:10.717
the last part of the known world.

00:31:10.717 --> 00:31:14.189
The rest of the world was
fairly well-known and mapped.

00:31:14.189 --> 00:31:16.011
He goes into Polynesia.

00:31:16.011 --> 00:31:19.440
He's a brilliant, great figure.

00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:23.310
I don't doubt that at all, I
call him Prospero in one sense.

00:31:23.310 --> 00:31:26.860
You know, trying to discover new world.

00:31:26.860 --> 00:31:30.680
And one of the interesting things is,

00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:34.146
wherever he goes, he
brings English animals.

00:31:34.146 --> 00:31:39.146
He plants the landscape with
English trees and fruit trees.

00:31:39.540 --> 00:31:43.370
It's a method of incorporating
this other society

00:31:43.370 --> 00:31:48.370
within the frame of English
ideas and culture and so forth.

00:31:49.086 --> 00:31:54.086
So I am not denying that
Cook was a very important

00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:55.930
figure of the European Enlightenment,

00:31:55.930 --> 00:32:00.470
and he the Prospero side to his persona,

00:32:00.470 --> 00:32:02.450
but I am saying that's not all there is.

00:32:02.450 --> 00:32:04.503
There's a dark side to the Enlightenment,

00:32:05.535 --> 00:32:08.583
you see, which we know
now today, I'm afraid.

00:32:08.583 --> 00:32:11.100
There's a dark side to the Enlightenment,

00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:15.450
and Cook represents what I
also call the Kurtz persona,

00:32:15.450 --> 00:32:19.160
that is, the person who
goes into this foreign land

00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:23.900
and gets, in some sense,
corrupted, so to speak.

00:32:23.900 --> 00:32:27.770
And I show the two aspects
of the Kurtz persona.

00:32:27.770 --> 00:32:29.790
- Kurts from Heart of Darkness.

00:32:29.790 --> 00:32:31.010
- Heart of Darkness.

00:32:31.010 --> 00:32:33.000
I mean, so on the one hand,

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.470
he's bringing in the Enlightenment,

00:32:35.470 --> 00:32:36.970
the light, in some way,

00:32:36.970 --> 00:32:39.530
and on the other hand he's
bringing in the darkness,

00:32:39.530 --> 00:32:43.080
because of the way he treats
the natives and so forth.

00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:46.914
So that part of the Cook enterprise

00:32:46.914 --> 00:32:50.610
has been smothered in the representations,

00:32:50.610 --> 00:32:54.300
scholarly representations,
the popular representations.

00:32:54.300 --> 00:32:57.640
So what I do is to read between the lines,

00:32:57.640 --> 00:33:00.745
read the footnotes that others have used,

00:33:00.745 --> 00:33:03.971
and bring that to the surface.

00:33:03.971 --> 00:33:07.510
So when Cook, the crux of the issue

00:33:07.510 --> 00:33:10.790
is that when Cook went to Hawaii,

00:33:10.790 --> 00:33:12.640
the way that European scholars,

00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:15.570
some very distinguished ones, present it

00:33:15.570 --> 00:33:18.608
is that he was treated
as one of their gods,

00:33:18.608 --> 00:33:22.880
the god Lono, 'cause he was called Lono.

00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:24.370
But then I find out,

00:33:24.370 --> 00:33:25.260
that's the title of the book,

00:33:25.260 --> 00:33:27.660
European Mythmaking in the Pacific.

00:33:27.660 --> 00:33:29.890
The whole thrust of the book is to show

00:33:29.890 --> 00:33:32.340
that this is a European myth.

00:33:32.340 --> 00:33:35.690
And myths are, after all,
not just the prerogative

00:33:35.690 --> 00:33:37.880
of us in the third world, so to speak,

00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:42.800
but Europe to is a great
mythmaking culture.

00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:43.780
We know that.

00:33:43.780 --> 00:33:46.390
Even now, as we are here,

00:33:46.390 --> 00:33:50.130
it's myths that are being
created about wars and so forth.

00:33:50.130 --> 00:33:53.190
So what I try to show in that

00:33:53.190 --> 00:33:58.190
is the idea that the white
civilizer is a god to natives

00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:02.070
is a structure of the long
running European thought.

00:34:02.070 --> 00:34:05.630
It comes in Columbus, it comes in Cortes,

00:34:05.630 --> 00:34:07.840
and it comes in Captain Cook.

00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:11.995
And my argument was to show

00:34:11.995 --> 00:34:14.828
that they did treat
Cook with great respect

00:34:14.828 --> 00:34:17.245
on the model of one of their chiefs,

00:34:17.245 --> 00:34:20.817
they bowed before him and so forth,

00:34:20.817 --> 00:34:22.717
but they did that to their chiefs too.

00:34:24.170 --> 00:34:27.950
And there is no evidence
in Cook's journals

00:34:27.950 --> 00:34:32.700
and the journals of the
writers onboard ship

00:34:32.700 --> 00:34:35.030
that he was deified at all.

00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:37.080
But there is definite evidence

00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:39.500
that soon after Cook's death,

00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:44.500
that there were pantomimes
in Covent Garden

00:34:45.072 --> 00:34:49.280
in which Cook was
deified by the Hawaiians.

00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:52.340
So that was a European
construction, so to speak.

00:34:52.340 --> 00:34:55.860
Even before the first
ships went back to Hawaii.

00:34:55.860 --> 00:34:58.483
So my argument, therefore, is that,

00:35:01.970 --> 00:35:04.438
not just to point out the dark side

00:35:04.438 --> 00:35:06.890
of the Enlightenment project,

00:35:06.890 --> 00:35:10.100
particularly in respect of
the voyages of discovery,

00:35:10.100 --> 00:35:14.689
but also to show European
mythmaking at its peak,

00:35:14.689 --> 00:35:19.689
where Cook is transformed
into a god for natives.

00:35:22.410 --> 00:35:27.410
- Now, your new book is
called Imagining Karma.

00:35:27.630 --> 00:35:31.847
It was published by UC Press.

00:35:31.847 --> 00:35:36.440
And you spoke about it
in yesterday's lecture.

00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:40.293
What was the problem that you
were trying to address here?

00:35:41.410 --> 00:35:43.053
- Well I can put it in this way.

00:35:45.130 --> 00:35:50.030
All of us intellectuals,
myself included at one time,

00:35:50.030 --> 00:35:54.830
we imagine that theories of reincarnation,

00:35:54.830 --> 00:35:57.530
you know, is an Indic phenomenon.

00:35:57.530 --> 00:35:59.680
All of us think, well, you know,

00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:01.720
we associate that with Buddhism

00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:05.420
and with Hinduism and with
the religions of India.

00:36:05.420 --> 00:36:07.070
And a few people, of course,

00:36:07.070 --> 00:36:10.340
who are very well-versed in the classics,

00:36:10.340 --> 00:36:13.550
know that Pythagoras and
so forth also had that.

00:36:13.550 --> 00:36:15.730
But basically it's an Indic thing.

00:36:15.730 --> 00:36:17.250
And even there are scholars who say

00:36:17.250 --> 00:36:19.758
that Pythagoras borrowed it from India.

00:36:19.758 --> 00:36:23.664
So, you know, in the course of my reading

00:36:23.664 --> 00:36:26.389
and my anthropological experience,

00:36:26.389 --> 00:36:30.149
I began to question that whole thing.

00:36:30.149 --> 00:36:35.149
So the book was, the spur that led

00:36:36.510 --> 00:36:38.480
to the writing of the book was

00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:43.080
to expand the notion that the ideas

00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:46.710
of rebirth is not an Indic phenomenon,

00:36:47.579 --> 00:36:51.200
to decenter India, to delocalize India

00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:53.410
as the home and ground of rebirth.

00:36:53.410 --> 00:36:55.810
And to show that it is found,

00:36:55.810 --> 00:37:00.510
in a recent book called
Amerindian Rebirth,

00:37:00.510 --> 00:37:02.150
younger scholars have shown

00:37:02.150 --> 00:37:04.320
that Northwest Coast
Indians and other Indians

00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:08.640
had beautiful circular theories of rebirth

00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:10.540
where the soul goes round and round

00:37:10.540 --> 00:37:12.434
and comes back to the same

00:37:12.434 --> 00:37:14.730
patrilineal or matrilineal group,

00:37:14.730 --> 00:37:17.023
these beautifully circular systems.

00:37:18.070 --> 00:37:19.770
And then we know from West Africa,

00:37:19.770 --> 00:37:22.650
from Igbo, which I
describe in great detail.

00:37:22.650 --> 00:37:24.650
And other West African cultures,

00:37:24.650 --> 00:37:27.300
they too had theories of rebirth.

00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:29.750
And the locus classicus, you know,

00:37:29.750 --> 00:37:32.460
Malinowski, our great ancestor after all,

00:37:32.460 --> 00:37:34.381
wrote the Trobriand Islands,

00:37:34.381 --> 00:37:36.760
the religion of the Trobriand Islands,

00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:41.623
and that's, again, a wonderful
system of rebirth theory.

00:37:45.515 --> 00:37:48.027
So this led me to argue that, you know,

00:37:50.703 --> 00:37:54.670
led to a kind of theoretical argument,

00:37:54.670 --> 00:37:56.600
trying to make the point that,

00:37:56.600 --> 00:37:59.160
whether you are in ancient Greece

00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:03.986
or in ancient India or present-day India,

00:38:03.986 --> 00:38:06.110
or whether you are dealing with

00:38:06.110 --> 00:38:08.420
what I call small-scale societies,

00:38:08.420 --> 00:38:10.340
nowadays it's very unfashionable

00:38:10.340 --> 00:38:12.590
to use primitive and
tribe and all of that,

00:38:12.590 --> 00:38:17.590
there is, in rebirth, a kind
of elementary structure.

00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:22.720
That is, if you have a rebirth theory,

00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:26.543
you have the soul coming from some sphere,

00:38:26.543 --> 00:38:30.734
born into the womb of a
woman, conceived there,

00:38:30.734 --> 00:38:33.910
one is then born in the human world,

00:38:33.910 --> 00:38:35.900
you go around the life cycle,

00:38:35.900 --> 00:38:39.396
you die, you enter into
another world, you come back,

00:38:39.396 --> 00:38:43.321
and you have a cyclical
structure of continuity.

00:38:43.321 --> 00:38:45.149
You know, it goes round and round.

00:38:45.149 --> 00:38:47.301
It doesn't matter where you are.

00:38:47.301 --> 00:38:51.170
It may be Plotinus, it may be Empedocles,

00:38:51.170 --> 00:38:54.690
Pindar, Pythagoras, doesn't matter.

00:38:54.690 --> 00:38:58.850
Or the Buddha, or the Jain
saints, or the Amerindians.

00:38:58.850 --> 00:39:02.020
That elementary structure is there.

00:39:02.020 --> 00:39:04.380
And any other system, so to speak,

00:39:04.380 --> 00:39:07.260
whether you are talking
about Greek rebirth or Plato,

00:39:07.260 --> 00:39:10.040
I think, contrary to some
of my classical friends,

00:39:10.040 --> 00:39:12.992
I believe that Plato was not writing

00:39:12.992 --> 00:39:17.850
his stuff on rebirth as
allegory, as many people think,

00:39:17.850 --> 00:39:20.350
but he really believed in it, you know?

00:39:20.350 --> 00:39:23.120
So whether you are Plato or
whether you're the Buddha,

00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:25.410
and these are very powerful thinkers,

00:39:25.410 --> 00:39:27.830
they have to build their system of thought

00:39:27.830 --> 00:39:30.270
on this elementary structure.

00:39:30.270 --> 00:39:33.800
This permits, in some sense,
comparison, I am saying.

00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:36.170
So since this permits comparison,

00:39:36.170 --> 00:39:38.500
I am sort of arguing against

00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:41.260
the dominant trend in my own profession

00:39:41.260 --> 00:39:43.750
and in postmodernism in general,

00:39:43.750 --> 00:39:46.382
that everything in the
world is fragmented,

00:39:46.382 --> 00:39:51.382
cultural and ethical
relativism is everywhere,

00:39:52.100 --> 00:39:53.780
and I am saying, yes it is everywhere

00:39:53.780 --> 00:39:56.370
but it is also not, you know?

00:39:56.370 --> 00:39:58.500
And you take these structures

00:39:58.500 --> 00:40:03.020
and you can demonstrate the existence

00:40:03.020 --> 00:40:06.753
of comparability in cultures.

00:40:08.858 --> 00:40:10.560
- So what I hear you're saying,

00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:12.370
and again, I'm not an anthropologist,

00:40:12.370 --> 00:40:16.100
so for the layperson, you're saying

00:40:16.100 --> 00:40:19.600
that what you're
discovering, on the one hand,

00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:24.600
is a kind of universalism, in
this case the rebirth story,

00:40:25.970 --> 00:40:28.480
that appears in all sorts of places,

00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:31.430
but on the other hand there is a richness

00:40:31.430 --> 00:40:35.770
in the particular setting
in which this occurs.

00:40:35.770 --> 00:40:38.550
And so the job of the analyst,

00:40:38.550 --> 00:40:40.200
in your case the anthropologist,

00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:42.821
is to see that, but on the other hand,

00:40:42.821 --> 00:40:46.630
dig out the local story and the way

00:40:46.630 --> 00:40:49.360
it's played out in that system.

00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:51.010
- Yeah, that's part of my argument.

00:40:51.010 --> 00:40:52.530
Part of my argument is that

00:40:52.530 --> 00:40:55.440
on the one hand these things
are comparable, on one level,

00:40:55.440 --> 00:40:57.860
because they share this
elementary structure.

00:40:57.860 --> 00:41:00.000
You have to build, so to speak,

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:01.390
complex system of thought,

00:41:01.390 --> 00:41:05.990
and Buddhism is a tremendously
complex system of thought,

00:41:05.990 --> 00:41:07.410
on these structures.

00:41:07.410 --> 00:41:10.460
Therefore, once these systems
of thought are constructed,

00:41:10.460 --> 00:41:13.360
obviously Buddhism is
different from Greek culture,

00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:15.650
it is different from Amerindians.

00:41:15.650 --> 00:41:18.470
But even so, even at
the level of complexity,

00:41:18.470 --> 00:41:21.200
there are some interconnections.

00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:23.629
You can't avoid them.

00:41:23.629 --> 00:41:26.820
So that is why I always say I'm both

00:41:26.820 --> 00:41:31.713
a relativist and an
anti-relativist in some sense.

00:41:33.380 --> 00:41:34.680
- One final question.

00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:38.010
If you were to advise
students who wanted to do

00:41:38.010 --> 00:41:41.170
this kind of work that you
have done in your career,

00:41:41.170 --> 00:41:43.510
what advice would you give them

00:41:43.510 --> 00:41:45.423
in terms of preparing for the future?

00:41:46.670 --> 00:41:49.000
- Well, one advice that I give them

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:52.663
is not to be seduced by current trends.

00:41:53.550 --> 00:41:56.960
I mean, to put it in this way,

00:41:56.960 --> 00:42:00.235
that nowadays when I
read a PhD dissertation,

00:42:00.235 --> 00:42:05.235
it is not, I mean, people have
to use Foucault, for example.

00:42:07.527 --> 00:42:11.590
I mean, virtually every
dissertation I read

00:42:11.590 --> 00:42:13.740
has something to do with Foucault.

00:42:13.740 --> 00:42:17.010
I mean, I'm saying, I myself believe

00:42:17.010 --> 00:42:19.933
that Foucault was a wonderful person,

00:42:19.933 --> 00:42:23.110
a great thinker and so forth,

00:42:23.110 --> 00:42:24.550
but I'm also saying that one

00:42:24.550 --> 00:42:28.054
cannot be seduced to that degree.

00:42:28.054 --> 00:42:30.823
Like me, for example,

00:42:32.282 --> 00:42:34.450
I very much admire Foucault,

00:42:34.450 --> 00:42:38.620
but I like to go back
into Nietzsche, you see,

00:42:38.620 --> 00:42:41.970
whom, I mean after all, the will to power

00:42:41.970 --> 00:42:43.430
was not Foucault's invention,

00:42:43.430 --> 00:42:45.750
it was, in some sense,
Nietzsche's invention.

00:42:45.750 --> 00:42:47.690
And in my way of thinking,

00:42:47.690 --> 00:42:50.130
though Nietzsche was not
as systematic a thinker,

00:42:50.130 --> 00:42:52.790
we all know that, as Foucault was,

00:42:52.790 --> 00:42:54.800
but there's a damn sight more insight

00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:57.430
in Nietzsche's thinking
about the will to power,

00:42:57.430 --> 00:42:59.638
the creative aspect of the will to power,

00:42:59.638 --> 00:43:02.197
the destructive aspect
of the will to power.

00:43:02.197 --> 00:43:07.197
So I'm saying to some of, you know,

00:43:07.544 --> 00:43:10.642
to address your problem, I would say

00:43:10.642 --> 00:43:14.503
that one should not be
seduced by current fashion.

00:43:15.395 --> 00:43:18.850
One should approach
current fashion critically,

00:43:18.850 --> 00:43:21.720
and one should not dump the past entirely,

00:43:21.720 --> 00:43:24.350
because after all, in some sense,

00:43:24.350 --> 00:43:28.700
you know, all of us are
creatures of tradition.

00:43:28.700 --> 00:43:30.640
And to dump the past, to dump Freud,

00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:34.860
to dump Weber and so forth,
in my view, is a mistake.

00:43:34.860 --> 00:43:38.040
I mean, one should adapt Freud,

00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:41.350
one should rethink Freud,
one should rethink Weber,

00:43:41.350 --> 00:43:43.580
bring perhaps Freud and Weber in line

00:43:43.580 --> 00:43:46.252
with postmodernity to some degree.

00:43:46.252 --> 00:43:51.252
But I don't think one should
be seduced by current fashions.

00:43:55.690 --> 00:43:58.030
That's my thought on the matter.

00:43:58.030 --> 00:44:00.350
- With that note, I
wanna thank you very much

00:44:00.350 --> 00:44:03.050
for joining us today and for coming

00:44:03.050 --> 00:44:06.183
to the campus to give
the Foerster Lecture.

00:44:06.183 --> 00:44:07.229
Thank you.

00:44:07.229 --> 00:44:08.775
- It's a pleasure to be here.

00:44:08.775 --> 00:44:10.493
- And thank you very much for joining us

00:44:10.493 --> 00:44:12.243
for this conversation with history.
