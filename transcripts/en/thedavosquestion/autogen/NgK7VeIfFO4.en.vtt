00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.240
ï»¿The Copanhaguen summit left many things
unresolved.

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:09.670
But we need to move on and advance.

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:17.480
Colombia has proposed that the preservations
of the jungles is fundamental

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:25.070
in any policy against climate change. And
that, the conservation of the jungle must

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:26.570
be remunerated.

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.670
Colombia, as an example, we've been working
on a program of "Forester Family",

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:37.329
families in charge of the destruction of the
forests, in the case of Colombia, by growing

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:38.329
cocaine.

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:42.239
We have come to an agreement with those families
so that they keep the forests cocaine-free,

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.340
and they get remunerated.

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:50.070
We believe that in the world, Global Warming
policy must be committed to the principle

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.970
of the conservation of the jungle

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:59.449
and in the principle of remuneration for the
conservation of the jungle.
