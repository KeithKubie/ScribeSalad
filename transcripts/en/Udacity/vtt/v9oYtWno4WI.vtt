00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:04.520
So Trulin you mentioned that you have a European ancestry background

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:07.480
which didn't surprise you too much, but I really liked to

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.370
know about your paternal lines. So from your Y chromosome, do

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:12.170
you mind logging in and showing us what it looks like?

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:13.910
&gt;&gt; No, not at all. Show us what

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:18.040
to navigate to get to this information. so basically

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:21.290
you go to My Results and then you go

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:26.230
to, under Ancestry Overview you go to Paternal Line.

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.430
&gt;&gt; So what does it say? What are you?

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:32.680
&gt;&gt; I am R1b1b2a2a 2f2.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:33.770
&gt;&gt; That is a mouthful.

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.140
&gt;&gt; It is. Which is a subgroup of R1b1b2.

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.990
&gt;&gt; And so, where is this from? Where does this take us?

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:45.320
&gt;&gt; it says that around 500 years ago, before the era

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:51.010
of intercontinental travel, I was predominantly from the

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.570
Southern European area. And it looks like there are some spots other

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.330
places too, like maybe even less so like the Middle East and some.

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:58.440
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.840
&gt;&gt; Western parts of Asia.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:00.360
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.470
&gt;&gt; this is, is this what you

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:06.750
expected? Did you expect anything? is this surprising?

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.080
&gt;&gt; It's a little surprising. I mean, I

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.280
thought like both my maternal and paternal line

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.180
will be primarily all from the Northern European

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.120
sections, but this is showing the Southern European section

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.510
with a lot of spread out into other areas.

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:21.060
&gt;&gt; So, what kinds of populations does it say

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.030
this Y chromosome paternal and half a group per pattern.

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:26.280
&gt;&gt; So, if you look at it here, it

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.380
says that the populations are Irish, Basque, British and French.
