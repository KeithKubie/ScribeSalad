turns out that Proxima Proxima Centauri

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020
turns out that Proxima Proxima Centauri
 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.640

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.090
B is an earth-like planet that circles
around the closest star to the planet

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100

Earth what a coincidence so what means

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680
Earth what a coincidence so what means
 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.620
Earth what a coincidence so what means
that we've already staked out our first

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630

destination for visitation by an
 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.350
destination for visitation by an
interstellar starship and that is

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360
interstellar starship and that is
 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.080
interstellar starship and that is
Proxima Centauri B a planet that goes

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090
Proxima Centauri B a planet that goes
 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.750
Proxima Centauri B a planet that goes
around one of the stars in the triple

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:50.760
around one of the stars in the triple
 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.120
around one of the stars in the triple
star system and so this could be the

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130
star system and so this could be the
 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.640
star system and so this could be the
first of many different kinds of

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:55.650

of course they're technologies won't be

of course they're technologies won't be
 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.030
of course they're technologies won't be
available to the next 100 years but

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040
available to the next 100 years but
 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.860
available to the next 100 years but
remember we're talking about the future

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870
remember we're talking about the future
 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.120
remember we're talking about the future
of humanity and

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130
of humanity and
 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.220
of humanity and
future of humanity I think could be in

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230
future of humanity I think could be in
 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.410
