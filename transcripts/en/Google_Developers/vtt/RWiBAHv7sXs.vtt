JEFFREY POSNICK:
Hey, everybody.

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:13.350
Welcome to this week's YouTube
Developers Live.

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:16.500
I'm Jeff Posnick coming to
you all from New York.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.190
And this week we have some
special guests, the folks

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:21.720
behind Magisto.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.155
And that would be Oren Boiman,
who's the CEO and founder; and

00:00:27.155 --> 00:00:29.740
Ori Hasse, the VP of Research
and Development.

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:31.730
So, welcome, guys.

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.030
Thanks so much for joining us.

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:34.070
OREN BOIMAN: Thank you.

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:35.550
Thank you for inviting us.

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:35.930
JEFFREY POSNICK: Absolutely.

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:37.640
I'm really excited
about this show.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.020
I'm flying solo this week.

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.380
My colleagues Jeremy and Jarek
are both traveling, and you

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:46.580
guys will have to put
up with me for now.

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:48.350
Before we get started,
not everybody's

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:49.540
familiar with Magisto.

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.830
Can you tell us a little
bit about your company?

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:54.240
When was Magisto founded?

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.040
Where are you guys based?

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.180
And we'll talk more about
product in a bit.

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:00.110
OREN BOIMAN: Sure.

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.820
Magisto is kind of a magical
video editor.

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:10.570
It's an app that takes any kind
of plain, ordinary videos

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.160
and edits them automatically,
like a human video editor

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.480
expert would do.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:20.230
But it does that in any scale
and essentially in real time.

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:23.630
And so it takes the real boring
videos that everyone

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:29.410
knows and do nothing with and
turns it to unforgettable

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:31.530
movies that you want to
share with everyone.

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.020
And it does it in a
matter of minutes.

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:42.495
This seemingly simple task of
editing videos is actually a

00:01:42.495 --> 00:01:48.580
very, very complicated task
involving a lot of artificial

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.010
intelligence technology that is
about understanding what's

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.510
going on inside the video and
then deciding how to tell a

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:01.190
story out of the footage that
you have, and then doing,

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.450
obviously, all the technical
stuff of delivering the video

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.010
and providing it to the user.

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:12.330
We founded the company in 2009,
basically just starting

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.430
with very strong technologies
for video understanding, which

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.860
is the domain of, I'd say,
artificial intelligence in

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.550
this video.

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:28.290
And we've built Magisto as a
consumer product around it to

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.100
enable essentially everyone
to be able to do something

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.780
meaningful with the videos that
we all capture but do

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.290
nothing with.

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.740
JEFFREY POSNICK: Awesome.

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:41.135
And you guys, I know, are coming
to us live from Tel

00:02:41.135 --> 00:02:41.860
Aviv right now.

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.430
So thanks for staying up late
and joining us with the time

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:46.560
zone difference.

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.520
And you talked a little bit
about what Magisto is.

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.730
Who are the target users
for Magisto?

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.140
What type of people go out
and find it useful?

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.670
OREN BOIMAN: There's actually
a very wide range of users.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.650
It's basically everyone
that captures video.

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.600
Because essentially
the raw footage

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.530
that everyone captures--

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.090
it might be on smartphones,
camcorders,

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:15.750
digital still camera--

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:22.720
it is something that holds
the most important

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.110
memories that you have.

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:28.750
But actually, no one does
something meaningful with most

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.080
of the personal video.

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.480
If you think, for instance, on
YouTube, most of the content

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.770
that's being uploaded to YouTube
doesn't contain all

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:39.020
the videos that people
capture.

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:41.160
It is only the best
of the best of the

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.090
video that people capture.

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:46.940
And the reason is that video
requires editing, but

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.150
editing is a task.

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.340
Manual video editing is
something which is very

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:53.030
complicated.

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:57.710
It can take someone who is not
very proficient with this task

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:00.725
between hours to days
to get to a few

00:04:00.725 --> 00:04:02.240
good minutes of video.

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.940
But without the--

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:03.320
JEFFREY POSNICK: Yes,
I definitely have

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:03.780
experience with that.

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.090
Yes, indeed.

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:06.070
OREN BOIMAN: Yeah.

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:08.910
Many, many people consider video
editing as a one-time

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:10.120
experience.

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.220
You do it only once because
you're so discouraged by that.

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:21.990
Videos, for everyone, contain
a lot of the most important

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:24.690
experiences that we have, but
we have nothing to do with

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.730
them, because it's
too difficult.

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:29.180
So essentially, it's everyone.

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.930
But if you go deeper to
understand who are the

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:37.380
consumers of such a product, you
can find, again, teenagers

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.840
using Magisto to create fun
experiences they've had with

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.630
their friends, young parents
trying to document their

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:46.810
children's lives and sharing
them with the family, people

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:48.530
doing amazing things
on YouTube.

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:52.080
We have an integration in
YouTube, which we can discuss.

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:57.710
People are uploading very
interesting public content.

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:03.610
It might be just a sports event,
and they create very

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:07.880
interesting highlights of that
with music and everything.

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:13.620
So, essentially, everyone that
wants to communicate using

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:16.980
video will find very high value
in Magisto, because it

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:18.970
takes out the work of
video editing and

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:20.310
just keeps the fun.

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:20.800
JEFFREY POSNICK: Absolutely.

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.340
And I personally have a young
son at home, and I've used

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:27.750
Magisto a couple of times now
to take the 10 minutes of

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:30.490
footage that you shoot waiting
for something interesting

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:32.240
happen and kind of condense
that down into something a

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:33.980
little bit more manageable.

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:36.100
And it really works well.

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:40.360
We've been talking about it,
and your product, it really

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.970
hits home more when you see
a video demo of it.

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:46.340
So we have a recorded video
that I wanted to show

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:47.960
everybody now so you can get
a better feel for what the

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:49.030
product is.

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:50.730
It specifically talks
about the Android

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:52.707
integration that you have.

00:05:52.707 --> 00:05:53.186
OREN BOIMAN: Awesome.

00:05:53.186 --> 00:07:41.548
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:07:41.548 --> 00:07:42.544
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:07:42.544 --> 00:07:43.540
JEFFREY POSNICK: Cool video.

00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:47.140
So hopefully, folks know a bit
more about what we're talking

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:50.104
about right now and have the
visual to connect to it.

00:07:50.104 --> 00:07:55.250
Yeah, so if you wanted to say
a bit more about what the

00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:57.880
integration is like with this
Android application--

00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:00.890
I don't know if you want to do
that demo that we were trying

00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:03.270
before, where you would show
from Android, or if you want

00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:06.610
to do a screen share to give
people more of a live feel for

00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:10.020
the product, whatever would be
the best way for you to show

00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:10.700
things off.

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:13.860
OREN BOIMAN: So maybe I'll do
a screen share to show--

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:16.320
first, before discussing
the Android

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:18.270
integration, I'll show--

00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:20.360
actually, the first integration
that we did is

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:23.370
inside YouTube Create.

00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:25.910
JEFFREY POSNICK: That would be
perfect, given that this is

00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:26.580
the YouTube show.

00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:28.880
We probably shouldn't talk too
much about the Android stuff.

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:31.600
We'll focus on the YouTube
integration.

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:36.950
OREN BOIMAN: So what you see
right now on the screen is

00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:40.389
Magisto on YouTube Create.

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:47.320
That's
youtube.com/create/magisto.

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:53.140
And if you want to use Magisto
on YouTube just to send

00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:57.470
directly videos to YouTube, you
can go straight to there.

00:08:57.470 --> 00:09:08.110
And you get a very similar flow
or user interface to use

00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:09.560
Magisto inside YouTube.

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:14.740
So you can either upload your
files from your computer, or

00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:19.330
you can use the very recent
Google Drive Inspiration--

00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:20.390
JEFFREY POSNICK: Which
I love, by the way.

00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:23.440
I was trying that because I have
all my home movies backed

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:24.750
up on Google Drive already.

00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:27.950
So not having to re-upload
them really was amazing.

00:09:27.950 --> 00:09:29.000
OREN BOIMAN: Right.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.800
And it is extremely fast.

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:32.750
That's the good thing.

00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:38.270
So let's do a live demo here,
where I'll select some files

00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:42.030
from my Google Drive
and use them.

00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:46.280
These are full HD videos that
would take me a lot of time to

00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:49.100
upload from my laptop.

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:55.630
And here I select a couple of
videos, and I will just add

00:09:55.630 --> 00:09:59.920
them to the movie I want
to create with Magisto.

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:06.130
And after you select the videos
themselves, then you

00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:10.230
can add a title to the
movie if you want.

00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:11.350
So let's call that--

00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:12.600
[TYPING].

00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:20.360
And then you can select
some soundtrack.

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:26.190
Let's select some party
beat style.

00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:27.786
JEFFREY POSNICK: Sounds good.

00:10:27.786 --> 00:10:30.582
OREN BOIMAN: That's good.

00:10:30.582 --> 00:10:35.004
And going to try this one.

00:10:35.004 --> 00:10:36.980
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:37.830
OREN BOIMAN: Awesome.

00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:39.900
This is it.

00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:44.390
What happened right now is that
YouTube managed to upload

00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:48.040
more than I think 150 megabytes
in the split of a

00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:50.340
second, because it was done
from Google Drive.

00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:56.080
And right now, Magisto engine
servers are doing the number

00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:59.180
crunching to analyze the video,
produce it, do the

00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:00.090
editing and everything.

00:11:00.090 --> 00:11:01.880
In a couple of minutes, it's
going to be ready.

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:05.480
And it's going to be ready
on My Movies in Magisto.

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:07.140
It's going to be posted
to your YouTube.

00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:08.860
It's going to be available
on my Android

00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:09.880
device, if I have one.

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:12.000
It's all connected to the
same account, which is

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.690
stored on the cloud.

00:11:13.690 --> 00:11:14.510
JEFFREY POSNICK: Gotcha.

00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:17.870
And just for folks that are
seeing that use flow for the

00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:21.860
first time, when I was going
through it, it's kind of hard

00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:24.770
for somebody who's used to the
traditional video-editing

00:11:24.770 --> 00:11:28.550
experience where you have to
think very carefully about,

00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:31.160
these are the clips I want to
splice together in this

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:31.820
particular order.

00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:36.970
It's like handing off control
and trusting the algorithm a

00:11:36.970 --> 00:11:41.350
bit to get things right, which
obviously makes things

00:11:41.350 --> 00:11:45.760
wonderful for people who really
don't want to face the

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:49.200
task of doing their
own video editing.

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:52.710
How much can you tell us about
what's going on behind the

00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:56.360
scenes in terms of your back-end
algorithms for

00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:58.240
actually finding the interesting
portions of the

00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:00.860
video or the most relevant
portion?

00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:02.370
Obviously, I don't want you
to disclose anything too

00:12:02.370 --> 00:12:03.100
proprietary.

00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:08.480
But I'm curious, and I'm sure a
lot of other folks are, too.

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:15.380
OREN BOIMAN: What I can say is
there's two parts to the basic

00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:18.730
engine that we do in order to
analyze and produce video.

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:23.970
We started from videos
and pixels.

00:12:23.970 --> 00:12:28.170
And in order to do this in video
editing, you need to

00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:31.520
move from notions such as pixels
to very high-level

00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:35.090
notions, such as characters and
scenes and behaviors and

00:12:35.090 --> 00:12:37.140
interactions between
people and objects.

00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:39.950
And there might be
pets, whatever.

00:12:39.950 --> 00:12:46.690
So the first step that we do
is a step of analysis that,

00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:49.820
using the very sophisticated
technology we have to look for

00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:54.244
video understanding, leaves
us with kind of--

00:12:54.244 --> 00:12:57.750
it is a semantic description of
what's going on essentially

00:12:57.750 --> 00:12:59.250
in every frame in the video.

00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:03.120
But it's not low-level
description, such as things

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:06.250
are moving, but this
is an object.

00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:07.890
This is an important
character.

00:13:07.890 --> 00:13:09.760
He moves from left to right.

00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:11.170
The camera's tracking him.

00:13:11.170 --> 00:13:12.860
It's doing zoom in, et
cetera, et cetera.

00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:17.440
And we manage to use this
metadata in order to decide

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:20.720
what are the important parts of
the video, where we should

00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:24.055
focus, how to tell the story,
what parts can we discard from

00:13:24.055 --> 00:13:25.100
the editing.

00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:31.700
So the second part of the
algorithm we apply is less

00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:34.060
analytical and more--

00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:35.830
you can think of
it as an expert

00:13:35.830 --> 00:13:38.300
system of a video editor.

00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:40.330
So this is the creative
part, right?

00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:44.450
JEFFREY POSNICK: Which is
historically very difficult to

00:13:44.450 --> 00:13:46.850
codify in an algorithm.

00:13:46.850 --> 00:13:49.460
OREN BOIMAN: And that is a
different domain, right?

00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:53.080
Even with accurate description
of everything that goes on the

00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:56.360
video, you still have to decide
how to tell a story.

00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:57.800
That's art.

00:13:57.800 --> 00:13:58.850
That's art and algorithms.

00:13:58.850 --> 00:14:02.740
And then you need to decide
what's the basic information

00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:06.910
that we have in the video?

00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:10.960
The video footage that the user
provided obviously didn't

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:11.690
help a lot.

00:14:11.690 --> 00:14:13.350
It doesn't tag the videos.

00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:14.680
It's just raw footage.

00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:17.560
So we need to decide
it automatically.

00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:23.520
And then what we also do is we
take the user selection, for

00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:26.630
instance, the user's selection
of music and theme, and we use

00:14:26.630 --> 00:14:30.530
the selection in order to decide
how to tell the story.

00:14:30.530 --> 00:14:34.450
So, for instance, you can take
basic footage of essentially

00:14:34.450 --> 00:14:39.720
everything and tell it like a
horror story, or tell it like

00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:41.240
a comedy, or tell
it like it's a

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:44.120
nostalgic, sentimental story.

00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:45.220
And that's editing.

00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:47.990
Editing is manipulation of the
footage, and it can tell a

00:14:47.990 --> 00:14:48.650
story many ways.

00:14:48.650 --> 00:14:51.610
So we take the selection of
the user of the theme, and

00:14:51.610 --> 00:14:54.630
then we select how to inject
the right emotion.

00:14:54.630 --> 00:14:57.170
So you could take the same
footage with Magisto and try

00:14:57.170 --> 00:15:03.260
to edit one time with party rock
and the next time with

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:08.610
some old-style jazz music.

00:15:08.610 --> 00:15:10.480
It's going to look completely
different.

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:11.840
It's not going to only
sound different.

00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:13.100
JEFFREY POSNICK: That's
really interesting.

00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:13.800
I didn't realize that--

00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:13.980
OREN BOIMAN: You can
probably do--

00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:14.840
JEFFREY POSNIAK: --from
the YouTube--

00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:16.290
OREN BOIMAN: --different
selections.

00:15:16.290 --> 00:15:19.600
Different selections and
completely different editing,

00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:20.540
and that's part of the fun.

00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:22.230
I mean, if you want to
inject some emotion,

00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:22.920
we'll let you do that.

00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:23.580
JEFFREY POSNICK: OK.

00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:26.190
Yeah, I struggled for a while
to find the right musical

00:15:26.190 --> 00:15:29.190
track to go with video
footage of my son.

00:15:29.190 --> 00:15:32.250
I didn't actually realize that
the musical track I chose

00:15:32.250 --> 00:15:34.370
would also affect the
editing decisions.

00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:36.380
So that's definitely
an interesting

00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:38.890
thing to keep in mind.

00:15:38.890 --> 00:15:43.670
OREN BOIMAN: And the last part
is obviously that this entire

00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:51.530
engine is wrapped in very, very
sophisticated back end

00:15:51.530 --> 00:15:54.200
and front end that
need to scale.

00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:57.810
Because this is the kind of--

00:15:57.810 --> 00:16:01.110
by the way, the video that
we just rated is ready.

00:16:01.110 --> 00:16:03.640
I just got a notification,
video is ready.

00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:06.130
You can take it from your
iPhone, Android device, or

00:16:06.130 --> 00:16:09.650
just go to the web and watch
the video, or YouTube,

00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:10.930
depending on when you put it.

00:16:10.930 --> 00:16:14.220
So again, the back end here is
extremely sophisticated.

00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:18.820
And the standard needs to scale
tasks which are very,

00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:21.430
very heavy.

00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:25.910
Video editing is very different
from handling things

00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:29.980
such as messaging or tweeting
or stuff like that.

00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:33.870
When it happens, the load
of the system increases

00:16:33.870 --> 00:16:35.630
dramatically.

00:16:35.630 --> 00:16:39.610
And you need to be able to scale
with huge amounts of

00:16:39.610 --> 00:16:42.020
video that might happen, like
hundreds of thousands of

00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:43.270
videos per day.

00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:49.460
Also, in that case, the
algorithms are very

00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:53.170
specifically designed
to this kind of

00:16:53.170 --> 00:16:56.300
management of the task.

00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:57.580
JEFFREY POSNICK: Gotcha.

00:16:57.580 --> 00:16:58.600
That's super interesting.

00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:01.270
Thank you for opening up like
that about a little bit of

00:17:01.270 --> 00:17:03.260
what's going on with
your secret

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:04.775
sauce behind the product.

00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:09.839
Given that, I kind of wanted
to shift the focus a little

00:17:09.839 --> 00:17:14.420
bit to talk about the specific
YouTube integration and some

00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:15.910
of the technical
details there.

00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:19.030
This is, after all, a YouTube
Developers Live show.

00:17:19.030 --> 00:17:22.920
And just maybe start with a
general question about which

00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:25.089
of the YouTube APIs
are you using--

00:17:25.089 --> 00:17:29.900
data API, player API,
that sort of thing.

00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:32.140
ORI HASSE: We're using
actually a

00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:33.330
lot of YouTube APIs.

00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:39.420
We're using YouTube APIs for
user authentication and

00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:41.190
connecting to the service.

00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:44.550
We, of course, use
the YouTube.

00:17:44.550 --> 00:17:47.610
We use the Google APIs for
connecting to the service.

00:17:47.610 --> 00:17:52.630
We use YouTube data APIs to
upload videos to YouTube, also

00:17:52.630 --> 00:17:54.930
parsed it with specific
metadata that

00:17:54.930 --> 00:17:57.520
we add to the videos.

00:17:57.520 --> 00:18:04.760
We use also Google G+ and
GDrive APIs to connect

00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:07.610
everything together.

00:18:07.610 --> 00:18:10.250
JEFFREY POSNICK: And I just
wanted to point out, thank you

00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:14.390
very much for using OAuth 2,
I noticed, as part of your

00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:15.440
authorization flow.

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:19.050
Because that presented a really
nice authorization

00:18:19.050 --> 00:18:20.830
experience to me as a user.

00:18:20.830 --> 00:18:24.030
And it's something that we
always try to hammer home to

00:18:24.030 --> 00:18:27.300
developers out there, that
OAuth 2 is the way to go.

00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:29.890
ORI HASSE: Yeah, and it also
will work very nicely on the

00:18:29.890 --> 00:18:34.780
Android to allow you to have
a seamless experience.

00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:36.680
JEFFREY POSNICK: Yeah,
absolutely.

00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:40.500
So you're using a wide
range of data APIs.

00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:43.640
In terms of the actual
underlying languages that a

00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:46.130
lot of your code base is written
in for interacting

00:18:46.130 --> 00:18:51.300
with YouTube, what's most of
your code that handles talking

00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:52.520
to the APIs written in?

00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:53.770
Which language?

00:18:56.300 --> 00:18:58.610
ORI HASSE: This part of the
system, our code is in Python.

00:18:58.610 --> 00:18:59.840
JEFFREY POSNICK: OK, cool.

00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:02.820
Are you using the Python Client
Library to talk to

00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:06.150
YouTube, or did you end up
rolling your own interface?

00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:06.285
ORI HASSE: No.

00:19:06.285 --> 00:19:11.696
Currently, we use a bit older
GData client library.

00:19:11.696 --> 00:19:13.330
JEFFREY POSNICK: Which,
apologies in

00:19:13.330 --> 00:19:14.870
advance about that.

00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:17.470
ORI HASSE: Yeah, and we're
moving now to the new APIs.

00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:19.970
JEFFREY POSNICK: The Python
Client Library, in particular,

00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:22.950
for GData is rather
out of date.

00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:27.550
And we've been telling people,
wait, wait, wait.

00:19:27.550 --> 00:19:29.210
We're going to have something
better coming out.

00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:34.250
So we do finally now have the
new Version 3 out there, and a

00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:37.860
nice new Python Client Library
to talk to Version 3.

00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:39.180
It's obviously a big
undertaking.

00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:42.250
I assume you guys haven't had
a chance to migrate yet, but

00:19:42.250 --> 00:19:44.630
hopefully you've checked
out the new client

00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:46.920
library for Version 3.

00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:51.650
ORI HASSE: Yeah, we didn't
migrate the YouTube APIs yet,

00:19:51.650 --> 00:19:53.810
but we're going to do
it pretty soon.

00:19:53.810 --> 00:19:55.560
JEFFREY POSNICK: And since
you're already using a lot of

00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:59.300
other Google APIs, hopefully
you'll have the advantage of

00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:03.130
having one client library that
you could use to talk to

00:20:03.130 --> 00:20:06.560
Google+, or Drive, or any
other of the Google APIs

00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:09.680
you're integrating with.

00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:14.340
OK, so, any general feedback you
have for me as a developer

00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:18.190
who's built a pretty
tight integration?

00:20:18.190 --> 00:20:21.790
This is your chance to let us
know what we could be doing

00:20:21.790 --> 00:20:26.190
better with the API and any
questions that you might have.

00:20:26.190 --> 00:20:31.750
OREN BOIMAN: So first, one thing
that I think might be

00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:38.330
interesting to people doing
the show is that we have

00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:41.830
released recently an API to
Magisto that we think it might

00:20:41.830 --> 00:20:46.240
be very interesting to YouTube
developers to sync with video.

00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:51.840
We have now Magisto capabilities
as developers and

00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:56.760
very interesting stuff that
we don't do with the

00:20:56.760 --> 00:20:57.990
product right now.

00:20:57.990 --> 00:21:01.790
For instance, we've seen advance
from real estate

00:21:01.790 --> 00:21:06.360
agencies that capture a lot of
video footage, but they don't

00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:09.670
get it to a very high-quality
form, but they can use the

00:21:09.670 --> 00:21:13.140
Magisto API in order to make it
perfect and then stream it

00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:14.420
to YouTube.

00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:15.650
JEFFREY POSNICK:
That's amazing.

00:21:15.650 --> 00:21:16.040
Cool.

00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:22.030
OREN BOIMAN: We'll amazing
things with legacy content,

00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:26.356
which is premium, but you want
to create trailers and do it

00:21:26.356 --> 00:21:27.360
in mass scale.

00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:30.550
So the only way to do mass-scale
video editing right

00:21:30.550 --> 00:21:32.420
now is the Magisto API.

00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:35.220
So I think that that's going
to be very interesting to

00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:36.020
YouTube developers.

00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:40.315
Just go to
developers.magisto.com and get

00:21:40.315 --> 00:21:41.560
an API key and start
to work with it.

00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:44.080
I think it's going to be--

00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:45.870
it's surprising how many
applications we have not

00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:47.750
thought about that can
be done with video

00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:50.132
editing and video footage.

00:21:50.132 --> 00:21:50.534
So that's one thing--

00:21:50.534 --> 00:21:50.936
JEFFREY POSNICK: Cool.

00:21:50.936 --> 00:21:52.010
I'll make sure some
folks internally

00:21:52.010 --> 00:21:52.660
know about that, too.

00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:55.380
Because I know you mentioned the
real estate videos, and I

00:21:55.380 --> 00:21:56.940
know that's a pretty
common thing.

00:21:56.940 --> 00:22:00.500
They're trying to sell something
using YouTube, and

00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:03.420
they tend to be like a minute
of the same shots over and

00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:04.030
over again.

00:22:04.030 --> 00:22:07.110
So that's very interesting.

00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:11.580
OREN BOIMAN: And I think that
as developers of the YouTube

00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:15.820
API, I think that what we've
seen, for instance, on the

00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:21.840
YouTube Create channel, is that
people create a lot of

00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:27.550
interesting content from meshing
and remixing content.

00:22:27.550 --> 00:22:32.140
It might be premium content and
their personal content.

00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:37.000
I'm not sure if all the
content is captured

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.680
in the right way.

00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:42.510
But I think that this is the
kind of thing that YouTube can

00:22:42.510 --> 00:22:46.500
provide, especially with the
Magisto as an app on it,

00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:51.710
amazing opportunities for people
to be creative, to take

00:22:51.710 --> 00:22:55.070
new kinds of content,
and re-mesh them.

00:22:55.070 --> 00:23:00.157
And we've seen amazing things
such as taking some trailer of

00:23:00.157 --> 00:23:04.930
a movie, and then taking it
through Magisto, creating a

00:23:04.930 --> 00:23:09.430
hard-rock, one-minute version,
and putting it again to

00:23:09.430 --> 00:23:14.090
YouTube, getting amazing
traction and responses because

00:23:14.090 --> 00:23:16.240
it's something completely
different and creative.

00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:18.790
So I think the opportunities
here are huge.

00:23:18.790 --> 00:23:22.800
We're just waiting to get a hold
of these kinds of APIs

00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:27.710
and provide users with these
kinds of options.

00:23:27.710 --> 00:23:28.610
JEFFREY POSNICK: That definitely
makes sense.

00:23:28.610 --> 00:23:32.650
I think that's feedback I've
heard before from other

00:23:32.650 --> 00:23:35.300
developers and probably
from you as well.

00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:38.760
So it's certainly something
that we know about and are

00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:41.330
trying to find the best
solution for.

00:23:41.330 --> 00:23:45.070
Very, very appreciated
feedback, that.

00:23:45.070 --> 00:23:49.690
Anything else that we haven't
covered yet that you feel we

00:23:49.690 --> 00:23:52.140
left out an important feature
of showing off with Magisto?

00:23:52.140 --> 00:23:57.010
Any other feedback that you
might have beyond that?

00:23:57.010 --> 00:24:00.410
OREN BOIMAN: So I think that,
again, just to mention again

00:24:00.410 --> 00:24:05.110
that beyond the API and Magisto
on YouTube, we have

00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:08.830
the integration right now
on iOS and Android.

00:24:08.830 --> 00:24:14.250
I think that right now, most of
the videos that the people

00:24:14.250 --> 00:24:19.790
capture are on smartphones, so
definitely people just want to

00:24:19.790 --> 00:24:21.610
experience--

00:24:21.610 --> 00:24:24.490
the best way to experience
Magisto, start from the

00:24:24.490 --> 00:24:26.380
smartphones and then
go to the APIs.

00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:28.620
Go to magisto.com.

00:24:28.620 --> 00:24:32.650
We're very interested to hear
about people's opinions on how

00:24:32.650 --> 00:24:38.510
to use it and how to better use
inside YouTube as well.

00:24:38.510 --> 00:24:39.420
JEFFREY POSNICK: Cool.

00:24:39.420 --> 00:24:40.810
That definitely makes sense.

00:24:40.810 --> 00:24:41.440
I've checked it out.

00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:43.563
It's a great product, so
hopefully, other folks will go

00:24:43.563 --> 00:24:46.310
out and try it as well.

00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:48.640
I apologize for some of the
background noise here.

00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:51.220
It kind of feels like we're in
a bank vault and somebody's

00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:53.520
trying to break in
to the studio.

00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:56.440
So before anything drastic
happens, it might be

00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:58.170
time to sign off.

00:24:58.170 --> 00:25:01.650
Before I do, I wanted to give a
quick plug to the fact that

00:25:01.650 --> 00:25:04.710
YouTube Developer Relations and
Google Developer Relations

00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:08.880
in general is hiring, as
we tend to be doing.

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:13.050
Developers.google.com/jobs is
the place to go if you're

00:25:13.050 --> 00:25:15.690
interested, you're out there
watching this and you're

00:25:15.690 --> 00:25:19.420
interested in doing the sort
of thing that I do.

00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:21.640
And we really wanted to
thank Oren and Ori

00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:24.550
for joining us tonight.

00:25:24.550 --> 00:25:27.740
Things are getting a little loud
here, so it might be time

00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:29.730
to go while we still can.

00:25:29.730 --> 00:25:30.936
So thanks so much.

00:25:30.936 --> 00:25:31.292
OREN BOIMAN: Bye-bye.

00:25:31.292 --> 00:25:31.650
ORI HASSE: Bye-bye.

00:25:31.650 --> 00:25:31.950
OREN BOIMAN: Thank you.

00:25:31.950 --> 00:25:32.250
ORI HASSE: Thank you so much.

00:25:32.250 --> 00:25:33.500
JEFFREY POSNICK: Cheers.
