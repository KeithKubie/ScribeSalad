00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.434
Before we discuss how to recovery from loads done

00:00:03.434 --> 00:00:06.689
too early is happening, let's first talk about the

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:10.224
store to load forwarding problem. For a load, we

00:00:10.224 --> 00:00:13.176
have to ask ourselves, which earlier store do we

00:00:13.176 --> 00:00:17.530
get our value from? Basically, there could be multiple

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:19.680
stores to the same address that our load is

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.230
going to. And we have to figure our which

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.570
store is the one to supply our value and also,

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:27.600
if none of them are matching, then we need to figure

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.720
that out, because then we need to go to memory. When a

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.304
store is finally resolved, we need to ask ourselves, which later

00:00:34.304 --> 00:00:36.748
load do I give my value to? So there might be a

00:00:36.748 --> 00:00:40.576
load whose addresses already known, once this store figures out the

00:00:40.576 --> 00:00:43.810
address and the value, we should be waking up the load that

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:47.050
wants that value. Note that there could be multiple loads that

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.590
the store needs to give the value to. So where do we

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:52.810
figure this out? In the load store queue.
