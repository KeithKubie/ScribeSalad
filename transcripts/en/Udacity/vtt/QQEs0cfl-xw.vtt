00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.780
Okay, so here's another example
of mechanism design and

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:05.650
I'm going to basically
break it into two bits.

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:10.060
I'm going to see if I can remind you
of a particular mechanism design that

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:13.602
somebody famous once used in
a story told in the Bible, and

00:00:13.602 --> 00:00:16.584
then point out that that's
kind of ridiculous.

00:00:16.584 --> 00:00:17.464
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; And then we're going to

00:00:17.464 --> 00:00:18.870
come up with something slightly better.

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:19.720
Does that seem fair?

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:20.867
&gt;&gt; I'm interested to see this, sure.

00:00:20.867 --> 00:00:24.420
&gt;&gt; Okay, so
this is the story of King Solomon.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.460
I drew King Solomon to look
remarkably like Curly.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:28.110
&gt;&gt; Fun.

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:29.013
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; I get to be King Solomon, finally,

00:00:29.013 --> 00:00:30.356
after all this time
&gt;&gt; You get to be King Solomon.

00:00:30.356 --> 00:00:32.755
So do you remember
the story of King Solomon?

00:00:32.755 --> 00:00:33.880
&gt;&gt; Yeah, he was wise.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.563
&gt;&gt; Okay, okay, let's go with that.

00:00:35.563 --> 00:00:39.067
So then tell me the story of King
Solomon and the two women and the baby.

00:00:39.067 --> 00:00:43.883
&gt;&gt; All right, so once upon a time
King Solomon was hanging around on his

00:00:43.883 --> 00:00:48.193
throne doing kingly things and
he would answer questions for

00:00:48.193 --> 00:00:53.260
the various people in the country
that he ruled, Judah, maybe?

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:54.720
&gt;&gt; Sure, let's go with that.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.242
&gt;&gt; But he was known for
being very wise, so

00:00:57.242 --> 00:01:00.997
people would come up to him
with very difficult problems.

00:01:00.997 --> 00:01:07.751
So one of the difficult problems was
two women came to him with a baby and

00:01:07.751 --> 00:01:12.673
each of the women claimed
the baby was her baby, and

00:01:12.673 --> 00:01:17.280
they could not come to
any kind of agreement.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.510
One of them it was actually the baby,
the other one was someone who really

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:24.480
wanted a baby, couldn't have a baby and
then took someone else's baby.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.520
And so this is not the sort of
thing you want to get wrong,

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.030
giving somebody's baby to
somebody who's not their mom.

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.970
&gt;&gt; Right, so, let's see.

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:31.962
So there are two women,

00:01:31.962 --> 00:01:34.640
we gotta give them names because I'm
having a hard time keeping track.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.350
So, let's just call them A and B.

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.460
A for Alice and B for-
&gt;&gt; Bob.

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:40.656
&gt;&gt; Bob.
That makes perfect sense.

00:01:40.656 --> 00:01:42.600
&gt;&gt; Wait, no, Beth.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.290
&gt;&gt; Beth, okay, so Alice and Beth.

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:45.870
And then there's a baby.

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:50.440
And so Alice comes to King Solomon,
says Beth stole my baby.

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.144
And then Beth comes to King Solomon and
says, Alice stole my baby.

00:01:54.144 --> 00:01:56.802
And then the baby just goes, ga,
because that's what babies do.

00:01:56.802 --> 00:01:58.210
See this little curly hair thing?

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:59.190
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's cool.

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.830
&gt;&gt; And now King Solomon does what?

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:07.510
&gt;&gt; So King Solomon checks whether
the baby is named A or B and then

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:11.960
can actually trace the genetic roots of
the baby back to the appropriate mother.

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.786
&gt;&gt; No, that was an episode of CSI.

00:02:13.786 --> 00:02:16.109
What does the story claim happened?

00:02:16.109 --> 00:02:17.310
&gt;&gt; Yes, I'm sorry.

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.432
So King Solomon says, all right,
I've thought about this a lot and

00:02:21.432 --> 00:02:25.119
I've decided that the only fair
way of dividing up the baby is

00:02:25.119 --> 00:02:28.473
by dividing up the baby,
giving half to A and half to B.

00:02:28.473 --> 00:02:33.175
And so that was what he claims he's
going to do, and he calls for his royal

00:02:33.175 --> 00:02:37.797
sword person to bring a sword and
he gets ready to cut the baby in half,

00:02:37.797 --> 00:02:42.726
at which point A-
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I recognize that royal sword.

00:02:42.726 --> 00:02:46.572
[LAUGH] It's a Jedi.

00:02:46.572 --> 00:02:50.410
All right, so the royal sword
person says, okay, I will

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:54.200
bring you the royal sword, and Solomon
gets ready to cut the baby in half.

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.803
And suddenly woman A cries out,
no, don't do it.

00:02:58.803 --> 00:03:00.940
B can have the baby.

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:02.576
&gt;&gt; No.

00:03:02.576 --> 00:03:03.701
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:03:03.701 --> 00:03:06.070
&gt;&gt; And so B gets to keep the baby.

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:07.196
&gt;&gt; I don't think that's what happened.

00:03:07.196 --> 00:03:11.712
&gt;&gt; No, so then King Solomon says aha,
I set this up all along.

00:03:11.712 --> 00:03:14.370
I never really was going to
kill the baby, let's say.

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.329
And instead what I wanted to find out
is who really cared for the baby,

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:23.460
this particular baby, and that would
be the particular baby's actual mother.

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:27.417
So the thought was that the mom
would rather have the baby live and

00:03:27.417 --> 00:03:30.273
be with a different mom
than be sliced in half,

00:03:30.273 --> 00:03:33.513
which would probably
complicate the baby's life.

00:03:33.513 --> 00:03:36.216
&gt;&gt; Yeah, actually I think it would
simplify the baby's life, but

00:03:36.216 --> 00:03:37.829
okay, I'm with you on that, right.

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:41.364
And then King Solomon could
just determine that, in fact,

00:03:41.364 --> 00:03:42.438
A was the mother.

00:03:42.438 --> 00:03:48.756
&gt;&gt; And, yes, sewed the baby back up and
gave the baby to A and sent B to prison?

00:03:48.756 --> 00:03:49.610
&gt;&gt; I don't remember.
&gt;&gt; I don't know.

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:52.730
Maybe he had a baby with B for B's sake.

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:53.810
I don't know.

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:55.770
That's not really part
of the story in my head.

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:58.153
The point, A leaves with the baby,
A is happy.

00:03:58.153 --> 00:03:59.274
B is disappointed but not so

00:03:59.274 --> 00:04:02.230
disappointed because there's
plenty of other babies to steal.

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:04.406
&gt;&gt; Right, and then of course there's
the poor swordsman who didn't even

00:04:04.406 --> 00:04:05.105
get to cut up a baby.

00:04:05.105 --> 00:04:08.190
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Okay, so this is-

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:09.260
&gt;&gt; He does look disappointed.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.280
&gt;&gt; I do, or he does, sorry.

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.950
He does look very, very disappointed.

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:14.884
Very sad, in fact there's a single tear.
