1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,200
How long have you been doing this?

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:06,620
I mean like for TV, for animal planet. Uh,

3
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:08,800
three years I guess,
but to go on x.

4
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:12,290
The reason I got into that and doing
it for TV is because I've been doing it

5
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:16,100
like my whole life. I grew up in
Zimbabwe. My mom was a bush pilot,

6
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:17,750
so when we weren't on Safari,

7
00:00:17,751 --> 00:00:20,420
she was like flying us these remote
place in the middle of Bush and we were

8
00:00:20,421 --> 00:00:25,070
going out on safari and like, as long as
I can remember, this has been what I do

9
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:30,340
now. When you go on Safari, you and those
open jeeps walking safaris. Whoa. Yeah.

10
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:33,810
What are you doing?

11
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:37,560
Uh, we take a four, five, eight and
elephant gun. Put it on your shoulder.

12
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:42,740
Walking Safari. God Damn Man. Only during
the day, right. CanNot move at night.

13
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:45,530
And what do you do when you're confronted?
Okay.

14
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,180
I mean, I've had some pretty close
calls. Uh, my wife Jess is here with me.

15
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:50,770
I saved her from a hippo.

16
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:54,610
Oh yeah. We've had some
pretty close calls. Fuck man.

17
00:00:54,611 --> 00:00:57,100
One of my scariest pictures
I ever saw was this guy,

18
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:00,880
this African guy running down the street
and a hippo is chasing them and you

19
00:01:00,881 --> 00:01:04,510
look at the size of the hippo and you're
like, good Christ. That thing is huge

20
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:07,360
there, Joe. They're the
scariest animals on earth,

21
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:10,240
like interacting with the
hippopotamus there. So erratic.

22
00:01:10,241 --> 00:01:13,510
They're so unpredictable. If they
feel threatened at all, I mean, yeah,

23
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:18,020
they're just, this video is fucking
bananas. Oh yeah. This guy's on a row,

24
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,160
a motor boat, and the hippo is
swimming after him like a torpedo.

25
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,950
So this is where I'm from. This
is in Bob Way. Really? Yeah.

26
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,220
So it was this common
that they swim that fast.

27
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:29,730
They can move.
I mean this,

28
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:33,640
that this is uncommon to have one chase
the boat and come that close. But uh,

29
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:35,910
fucking big it is, man. Yeah.

30
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:41,340
So when you've had these close encounters,
what do you do? You shoot at the air,

31
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,170
shoot at the ground,
scare him away.

32
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,970
Fortunately I've,
I've never had to put an animal down,

33
00:01:45,971 --> 00:01:47,290
but I know people that have,

34
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:51,310
does your picture look at? That's
it. That's the one. What in the fuck,

35
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:54,220
how fast is that big bastard run?

36
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:56,600
Uh, I don't know. You'd have
to look up the exact speed,

37
00:01:56,601 --> 00:01:59,320
but definitely at top speed.
Definitely faster than humans.

38
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:01,040
But they don't have the maneuverability,
you know,

39
00:02:01,041 --> 00:02:02,530
you can kind of duck and dodge behind.

40
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:07,200
They're just don't run in a straight line.
Exactly. Exactly. Fuck that. 20 miles.

41
00:02:07,201 --> 00:02:09,540
Miles 19 yeah. Yeah.
What does a person run?

42
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:13,770
A Rhino runs 31 Jesus Christ.
Jesus.

43
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,970
A fucking Cheetah convert 75 miles an
hour. I thought it was like 50. Ah,

44
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:19,770
fuck yeah.
Stephanie,

45
00:02:19,771 --> 00:02:23,850
five crocodiles almost as fast as
the fucking hippo. Yeah, they're,

46
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:28,260
they're odd miles an hour for a croc.
Fuck that.

47
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:32,640
Let's be for sprinters around 2122 maybe.
That's a stain.

48
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:36,750
Yeah. That's also a sprinter.
[inaudible] sprinter,

49
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:38,600
doughy white guy like us.

50
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:43,800
Fuck Jesus Christ.
So you just,

51
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,350
if you're chased by a hippo,
is there a move that you do?

52
00:02:46,351 --> 00:02:49,510
Do you just have to go left and right
and Zigzag? Yeah, maneuverability get.

53
00:02:49,511 --> 00:02:50,970
So like when we got chased,

54
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,880
we got behind a termite mound and then
it kept going straight. Like, you know,

55
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:59,850
hiding behind termites now thinks
that safety like termites. Oh my God,

56
00:02:59,851 --> 00:03:01,920
dude,
that's so crazy.
