00:00:01.668 --> 00:00:04.404
(cop show music)

00:00:06.172 --> 00:00:07.941
- [Radio] Car 67,
come in car 67.

00:00:07.941 --> 00:00:10.110
- This is car 67,
- This is car 67,

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.478 align:start size:81% position:19%
- we're code five,
- code five,

00:00:11.478 --> 00:00:15.815 align:start size:97% position:3%
- nothing to report.
- we've got nothing to report.

00:00:15.815 --> 00:00:19.486
(muffled gunshots, screams)

00:00:22.956 --> 00:00:26.226
(80's cop movie music)

00:00:34.134 --> 00:00:34.968
- How was the party?

00:00:34.968 --> 00:00:36.503
- It's dead.

00:00:36.503 --> 00:00:39.372
They ran out of punch, so
I gave them some shots.

00:00:39.372 --> 00:00:42.809
(both laughing)

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.011 align:start size:84% position:16%
- You get them all?
- No.

00:00:45.011 --> 00:00:47.213
But Theresa Two did.

00:00:47.213 --> 00:00:48.815
(both laughing)

00:00:48.815 --> 00:00:52.419
(dramatic music, gunshots)

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.723
(guitar riff)

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:03.763 align:start size:84% position:16%
Well I guess I
didn't get them all.

00:01:03.763 --> 00:01:05.598
- Yeah, certainly seems like it.

00:01:05.598 --> 00:01:07.567
- Well that's why you're
here to cross the T's,

00:01:07.567 --> 00:01:10.336
and dot the--
(gunshots)

00:01:10.336 --> 00:01:11.905
And dot the I's.

00:01:11.905 --> 00:01:13.473
(laughing)

00:01:13.473 --> 00:01:14.441
- You done?

00:01:14.441 --> 00:01:15.642
- Done with what?

00:01:15.642 --> 00:01:17.310 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I mean, one guy,
that's understandable.

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.879
But two guys, come on?

00:01:19.879 --> 00:01:21.648
(gunshots)

00:01:21.648 --> 00:01:23.216
Three guys, come on Chance!

00:01:23.216 --> 00:01:24.751
- There was a lot of guys
in there, give me a break.

00:01:24.751 --> 00:01:26.820 align:start position:0%
- Maybe if you took two seconds
to double check your work,

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.189 align:start size:94% position:6%
I wouldn't have to always
clean up your mess.

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.690
- Oh well maybe if
you did something

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:32.392
instead of sit in the car
and hide like a coward,

00:01:32.392 --> 00:01:34.194 align:start size:84% position:16%
I wouldn't have to.
(gunshot)

00:01:34.194 --> 00:01:35.495
- I was calling for backup.

00:01:35.495 --> 00:01:38.098
God forbid we follow
procedure, just once.

00:01:38.098 --> 00:01:41.000 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Procedure, is like rules,
and Chance Blackstreet

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.969
doesn't follow the rules, man.

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:45.305
- I know Chance, everyone knows.

00:01:45.305 --> 00:01:47.140 align:start size:97% position:3%
But I don't even think
you're trying to be a rebel.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.742
I think you're just too dumb
to know what the rules are.

00:01:49.742 --> 00:01:51.010
(gunshot, groan)

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:52.645
You're too dumb to even
kill all the bad guys!

00:01:52.645 --> 00:01:54.747
Look at all the bad guys
you're making me kill!

00:01:54.747 --> 00:01:56.416
- Okay, now you're just
being hurtful Moses,

00:01:56.416 --> 00:01:57.884
you're starting to
hurt my feelings.

00:01:57.884 --> 00:01:59.319 align:start size:97% position:3%
- You hurt my feelings
first when you didn't ask me

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:01.788
to storm into the crack
house, you selfish fuck.

00:02:01.788 --> 00:02:03.356
You always just run
into the building,

00:02:03.356 --> 00:02:05.492
never once do you look back
at your fucking partner,

00:02:05.492 --> 00:02:07.327
you piece of dog shit!

00:02:08.228 --> 00:02:09.762
(gunshots)

00:02:09.762 --> 00:02:11.664 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Moses, calm down okay,
I mean you're getting

00:02:11.664 --> 00:02:13.299 align:start size:88% position:13%
a little loopy, you just
shot a lot of guys--

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:16.302 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Maybe I just want the chance
to die in the line of duty.

00:02:16.302 --> 00:02:17.137
Just once.

00:02:18.271 --> 00:02:19.772
- You've never said
that before man.

00:02:19.772 --> 00:02:21.241 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I'm tired of my
kids walking up to me

00:02:21.241 --> 00:02:24.244 align:start size:94% position:6%
and asking, "Hey dad,
what did Chance do today?

00:02:24.244 --> 00:02:25.712
Did he kill anyone?"

00:02:25.712 --> 00:02:27.280
Do you know how much more
they would respect me,

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.582 align:start size:97% position:3%
if I was laid up at a hospital
with a bullet in my chest,

00:02:29.582 --> 00:02:31.885 align:start size:94% position:6%
and a hole into my bad
ass leather coat to match?

00:02:31.885 --> 00:02:33.119
- That coat cost like 85 bucks--

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:34.487
- It's not about the
fucking coat, Chance.

00:02:34.487 --> 00:02:36.756 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Listen, you're a
great cop Moses, okay?

00:02:36.756 --> 00:02:38.691
And if those kids don't
respect ya, it's stupid.

00:02:38.691 --> 00:02:40.326
They don't respect
you, fuck those kids.

00:02:40.326 --> 00:02:41.427
- Hey those are my kids man.

00:02:41.427 --> 00:02:42.662
- And they're great kids.

00:02:42.662 --> 00:02:44.464
I'm just telling
ya, I respect you.

00:02:44.464 --> 00:02:47.634
(gunshots, screaming)

00:02:49.903 --> 00:02:53.072
Dude, listen.

00:02:53.072 --> 00:02:54.941
You're my partner man,
and I know I take you

00:02:54.941 --> 00:02:56.442 align:start size:84% position:16%
for granted sometimes,
but that's only

00:02:56.442 --> 00:03:00.513 align:start position:0%
because deep down inside, I
know you'll always have my back.

00:03:00.513 --> 00:03:02.849
- I love you, Chance.

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:04.918 align:start size:97% position:3%
- I can't say the same
thing to you Moses because,

00:03:04.918 --> 00:03:07.153 align:start size:81% position:19%
everyone I've ever
loved has died.

00:03:07.153 --> 00:03:10.456
- That's the nicest thing
anyone's ever said to me.

00:03:10.456 --> 00:03:12.292
- That's okay, you know what?

00:03:12.292 --> 00:03:14.360
Next time, I'm gonna let
you run into the drug den

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.729
all by yourself, okay?

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:19.566
Come on, there ya
go, there ya go.

00:03:21.334 --> 00:03:22.502
There ya "go."

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.840
There ya "go," let your
feelings "run" free.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.376 align:start size:97% position:3%
Just know Moses when you ever
"hit the bricks" of life,

00:03:30.376 --> 00:03:32.912
just keep on "walking" tall.

00:03:32.912 --> 00:03:34.847 align:start size:84% position:16%
You gotta "move
along" with your life.

00:03:34.847 --> 00:03:37.517
You just gotta spread
those wings and "fly,"

00:03:37.517 --> 00:03:40.820
just let it "go," just
let it "go," just "run."

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:42.255
- You're the best cop
in the world Chance.

00:03:42.255 --> 00:03:45.024 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Oh, yes I am.
- I love you so much.

00:03:45.024 --> 00:03:47.460
- Papa Blackstreet,
yeah there ya go.

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:50.263
No more kisses, just hugs.

00:03:50.263 --> 00:03:54.434
As a matter of fact no more
hugs, you're kinda sweaty.
