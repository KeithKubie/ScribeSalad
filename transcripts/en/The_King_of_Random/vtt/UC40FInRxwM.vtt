[Captions by Y Translator]
In today's video,
using the simplest of tools,

00:00:02.156 --> 00:00:04.600
I'm going to teach you
how to make a bow drill fire.

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:09.560
[Music]

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:10.840
Hey guys, I'm Nate.

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.020
And I'm Calli,
and it is really cold out here.

00:00:13.033 --> 00:00:14.670
So I'm going to teach you guys

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.079
how to build a fire
with nothing but this.

00:00:17.079 --> 00:00:19.550
That is, we're going
to use a knife to make

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:21.623
some other tools to make a fire.

00:00:21.623 --> 00:00:25.057
Today, we are learning
how to make and use a bow drill,

00:00:25.057 --> 00:00:26.676
the classic holding a stick

00:00:26.676 --> 00:00:29.500
and passing a bowl
over it to create a friction

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.500
that it actually starts a fire.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.928
Now, you guys
in the past have seen Nate

00:00:33.928 --> 00:00:35.050
and Grant teaching

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.628
multiple ways of making
different types of fires.

00:00:37.628 --> 00:00:40.100
The reasons that a bow-drill
fire is so cool is

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.900
that it's been around about
as long as people have,

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.960
and you can use the simplest
of tools to make it.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:47.640
So here's the basic idea.

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:49.000
Using a knife,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.880
paracord, and nature,
we're going to teach you

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.320
how to make the tools
to build a fire.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.440
It looks like we've got quite
a few materials out here,

00:00:55.447 --> 00:00:58.215
but you're saying we basically
just start with a knife,

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:59.599
and everything is from that.

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:00.720
Pretty much yeah.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.040
If you're in
a survival situation,

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:04.141
you don't even really
need the paracord.

00:01:04.141 --> 00:01:04.941
In a pinch,

00:01:04.941 --> 00:01:07.532
you could use a shoelace
for maybe one or two

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:08.150
bow drill fires.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.140
But to make things simple,

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.660
we're going to
have some paracord.

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:12.831
First off, I wanted to show

00:01:12.831 --> 00:01:15.250
you why paracord is
so essential to have,

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.700
especially if you're
out hiking in the wilderness,

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.900
and you might need it
for a survival situation.

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.426
This is a piece of paracord

00:01:21.426 --> 00:01:23.309
that has been
used several times,

00:01:23.309 --> 00:01:25.109
but it's already worn through.

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:28.050
So I've already cut a new piece
of paracord to use

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:29.240
with this bow.

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.080
This is a willow bow.

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.040
Now with your bow,

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.240
you just need a piece of wood
that's pretty decently curved,

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:36.920
but is really really strong.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.201
Now, Willow and Juniper

00:01:38.201 --> 00:01:40.680
are known for having
a nice gentle curve,

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.000
and being really really strong.

00:01:42.016 --> 00:01:44.194
Now what you don't want
is a piece of wood

00:01:44.194 --> 00:01:45.795
that's too thin for your bow,

00:01:45.795 --> 00:01:47.829
or something that's
going to be green,

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:49.115
or sap like, or resinous.

00:01:49.115 --> 00:01:50.376
The problem with that is

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.300
as soon as you start
trying to drill with that,

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:53.740
it's not going to last.

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:54.663
It's not that Willow

00:01:54.663 --> 00:01:57.450
and Juniper are the only types
of wood that works for this.

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.850
They just happen to be two

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.320
that make really nice shapes
and strengths for making bows.

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.100
They're also native
to the area that we're in.

00:02:05.105 --> 00:02:07.646
So as long as you have
a non-resinous, soft,

00:02:07.646 --> 00:02:10.435
very very dry wood,
you should be good to go.

00:02:10.435 --> 00:02:13.042
There's always going to be
some trial and error,

00:02:13.042 --> 00:02:14.600
but I bet you can start
your own fire.

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.660
This is a piece of sage root,

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.440
and that's called
the fire board.

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.500
That's going to start an ember,

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.160
and that ember is going to be
what starts the fire.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.600
So this is just a piece of board

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.660
that's been flattened
pretty well in both sides,

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.276
and while I think power tools

00:02:28.276 --> 00:02:30.591
may have been used to make
this particular one,

00:02:30.591 --> 00:02:32.041
you definitely don't need to.

00:02:32.041 --> 00:02:33.962
You can get this shape
with a knife

00:02:33.962 --> 00:02:34.950
if your patient,

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.008
or honestly, even
just a sharp rock.

00:02:37.008 --> 00:02:38.468
Now, this is a sage spindle.

00:02:38.468 --> 00:02:39.991
Now, this is a sage branch,

00:02:39.991 --> 00:02:41.871
and again, you
can use other things.

00:02:41.871 --> 00:02:43.459
Other excellent fire boards

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:46.224
that you can use is going
to be dry cotton wood,

00:02:46.224 --> 00:02:47.460
as well as Yuka,

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:48.860
but I didn't have
any Yuka available.

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.660
So we are using sage root
and the sage branch.

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.940
This right here is a palm rock.

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.460
Obviously, it's a rock,

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:59.180
and it's chosen because it
fits nicely into your palm.

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:00.220
That's going to be pretty key,

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:02.439
because you need to hold
on to it really well

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.573
while applying a lot
of pressure from the top.

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.673
You can probably see
there's a little divot

00:03:06.673 --> 00:03:07.915
in this rock right here,

00:03:07.915 --> 00:03:10.127
and this you make by just
finding another rock,

00:03:10.127 --> 00:03:11.677
and you start drilling into it,

00:03:11.677 --> 00:03:13.400
and that's going
to take you some time.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:14.312
Keep twisting it

00:03:14.312 --> 00:03:17.450
until you have a divot that's
just the right size to fit

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.182
with the piece in your stick.

00:03:19.182 --> 00:03:21.560
As you can see, I've already
assembled the supplies,

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.600
but this is probably
my favorite thing

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.740
that I carry with me
when I go backpacking.

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:30.340
This knife has a nice fine edge
along with a saw blade.

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.620
So as long as I had this knife
and some bootlaces,

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:36.172
I could probably
start a bow drill fire

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.380
in most areas in this region.

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:40.360
So you can already see

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.480
that I've cut the notches
in this bow.

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.560
We've got one on this side,
one on the other,

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:45.900
and that's just
keeps the Paracord

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.480
from slipping out of place.

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:49.352
The most important
thing to remember

00:03:49.352 --> 00:03:50.602
about a friction fire is

00:03:50.602 --> 00:03:52.710
that resinous wood
is not going to work.

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:54.440
Neither is any sort of wet wood.

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.660
This needs to be
as dry as dry can get,

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:57.800
and it's all trial and error.

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.800
You're usually not going to get
a fire on your first, second,

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.720
or even third try,
but you will get there.

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.940
All right.

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.050
So for the very last thing
that you're going to need,

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:07.292
this is Juniper bark.

00:04:07.292 --> 00:04:10.822
Now, Juniper is very common in
the desert around this region.

00:04:10.822 --> 00:04:12.518
Now, this is incredibly dry.

00:04:12.518 --> 00:04:14.407
You can see
how it's just flaking off

00:04:14.407 --> 00:04:15.207
as I hold it.

00:04:15.207 --> 00:04:16.164
There's literally

00:04:16.164 --> 00:04:19.780
like it's dark dust falling
off of this stuff right now.

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:21.200
That is exactly what you want.

00:04:21.202 --> 00:04:23.060
Now, I formed,
as best I can a nest.

00:04:23.063 --> 00:04:24.245
It's very very loose

00:04:24.245 --> 00:04:26.539
because we need
air flow to get through.

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:29.940
But we're going to need even
finer bark dust inside it.

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:31.500
That's what's going
to catch the ember

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:32.952
and really get it to spark.

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.860
So Nate, let me show you
how to do this.

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.940
So as you can see,
very very loose here,

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:41.580
and I've got quite a bit more.

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.900
So what you're going to want
to do, almost as if you

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.640
were trying to form a rope,

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:47.052
and then you're going
to twist it around.

00:04:47.052 --> 00:04:48.741
See if you can form
that into a nest.

00:04:48.741 --> 00:04:50.420
It's gonna just fall
apart in your hands.

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:51.940
Now, something you

00:04:51.941 --> 00:04:55.315
might want to note is
Juniper bark is useful as it is,

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:56.940
just so many splinters.

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:59.540
So just a very loose nest,
air can get through it.

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:01.169
To make it kind of nest shaped,

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:03.300
I just wrapped it
around in a circle,

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.640
and now I'm kind of
folding it in on itself.

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:08.232
So here's a couple of
differences that I was saying.

00:05:08.232 --> 00:05:10.818
This piece of sage root
was cut using power tools.

00:05:10.818 --> 00:05:13.250
This one was split
a little bit more naturally.

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:14.835
We've taken a knife to it,

00:05:14.835 --> 00:05:17.171
we'd cut a notch,
and then we taken a stone,

00:05:17.171 --> 00:05:18.312
and split it in half.

00:05:18.602 --> 00:05:19.800
And as you can see,

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.450
we've had lots
of successful fires with it.

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:25.300
So, your easiest knots
honestly on one side,

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:27.060
and normally
the straighter side,

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.316
you're going to go ahead and put
just a regular old square knot.

00:05:30.316 --> 00:05:32.186
So on the straighter
side of your bow,

00:05:32.186 --> 00:05:34.428
if you happen to have one,
just tie a knot.

00:05:34.428 --> 00:05:35.899
It doesn't really matter.

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:38.053
What's going to matter
is the other side.

00:05:38.053 --> 00:05:40.043
If you happen to have
a bow, like mine,

00:05:40.043 --> 00:05:41.993
where one side curves
a little bit more,

00:05:41.993 --> 00:05:43.208
that's going to be the side

00:05:43.208 --> 00:05:44.700
that you want
a clove hitch knot.

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:47.200
The reason that that's
so important is it that way,

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:49.040
we can actually adjust
the tension as we go,

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:51.840
so that we can make sure
that we don't drop our spindle.

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:53.840
All right, so it's
a little bit loose,

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:54.900
the clove hitch.

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:56.840
I can tighten it as I go.

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:00.100
That's...

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:03.320
Now we go hunting
with it, right?

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:04.740
First thing that
we're going to do,

00:06:04.749 --> 00:06:07.600
while we do have a usable
section here for the fire board,

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.500
Nate is really excited
to use my knife.

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:10.950
So we're going
to let him go ahead,

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:13.040
and cut a new notch
into the board itself.

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:16.340
Now, what you want to remember
is that you're going to actually

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:17.400
have your foot placed

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.660
on one side of this
to hold it in place.

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:21.840
So you're going to want to try
and keep it as close

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:23.421
to this other hole
here as possible.

00:06:23.421 --> 00:06:24.053
Near the edge.

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:25.820
Few different ways
that you can do this.

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:27.560
There's a pizza cut,
there's a regular notch,

00:06:27.577 --> 00:06:30.250
but what you're going to do is
you're going to cut a fine line

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:33.326
from here all the way through
to the other side in the bottom.

00:06:33.326 --> 00:06:36.140
You can choose a rectangle,
you can choose a pizza cut...

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.352
At this point,
it's really just preference.

00:06:38.352 --> 00:06:40.561
But the important thing is
that the notch

00:06:40.561 --> 00:06:42.980
that we cut will actually go
all the way down

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:44.640
into the middle of this divot.

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:46.200
When we're using our bow drill,

00:06:46.204 --> 00:06:48.442
the ember will form
in this divot right here,

00:06:48.442 --> 00:06:49.511
and we need the notch

00:06:49.511 --> 00:06:53.100
so it can actually fall out onto
whatever surface is below it.

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:55.767
Not just fall out,
you need that for airflow.

00:06:55.767 --> 00:06:57.962
The ember will not
form without that.

00:06:58.262 --> 00:07:00.050
So now, what we're
going to want to do,

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:02.453
you're going to drill
a very small divot.

00:07:02.453 --> 00:07:04.254
So the friction of the spindle

00:07:04.254 --> 00:07:07.537
is actually going to make
the hole much much larger.

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:09.480
But we start with
it pretty little.

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:10.480
The reason why?

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:12.700
You just don't want this
to slip out of place.

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:14.740
Now, everyone has preferences.

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:15.480
You can see

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:16.999
that this spindle is
a little bit rounder.

00:07:16.999 --> 00:07:19.600
It's been used a little bit
more than this one.

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:21.850
Now, if you have more
of a round edge here

00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:23.500
where it goes
into the fire board,

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:25.150
you're going to
get more friction,

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:26.840
more chance of a fire,

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:30.040
but this is going to start
smoking a lot faster.

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:31.900
So now we've got
our fire board ready.

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:33.047
We've got our spindle.

00:07:33.047 --> 00:07:33.657
Our bow set up.

00:07:33.657 --> 00:07:34.491
Now, the last thing

00:07:34.491 --> 00:07:36.110
that we're going to need
with all of this,

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:37.650
is we need something
to catch our ember.

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:39.204
Now, if you're out
in the wilderness,

00:07:39.204 --> 00:07:41.180
and you don't happen to have
just a piece of leather,

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:43.940
you can actually use just a leaf
or another board.

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:45.360
What you're going to do

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:47.553
is you'll place this
underneath your fire board,

00:07:47.553 --> 00:07:48.767
it'll catch the ember.

00:07:48.767 --> 00:07:50.380
So that once the
ember is formed,

00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:52.640
you can drop it
into your Juniper nest.

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:56.740
I'm taking a little bit
of this Juniper bark,

00:07:56.750 --> 00:07:59.627
and I'm just shredding it
and pinching it,

00:07:59.627 --> 00:08:02.489
and turning it into just
the tiniest smallest

00:08:02.489 --> 00:08:04.360
dust fibers that we can,

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:05.560
and that's what we're going

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:08.260
to try and get the ember
to really ignite first.

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:09.580
All right.

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:11.720
So Nate's got our nest.

00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:15.216
I'm going to go ahead
and get everything prepped here.

00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:17.180
So I've got my piece
to catch the ember.

00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:18.540
I've got my fire board.

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:20.660
I have my spindle,
and then palm rock.

00:08:20.661 --> 00:08:22.047
Now I'm taking off my gloves,

00:08:22.047 --> 00:08:24.674
because as nice as they are,
it's really not going to help

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:26.580
when I'm trying
to hold this bow.

00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:28.440
So what you're going to want
to do is you're gonna have

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:31.000
your dominant hand
with your knee on the ground.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.602
Your other foot's going
to hold your fire board,

00:08:33.602 --> 00:08:35.382
and then take
your your bow,

00:08:35.382 --> 00:08:37.000
and take your spindle.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.500
Now, this will take
if you try sometimes.

00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:41.840
I'm probably going to fling
this across the yard,

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:43.240
but what you're going to do,

00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:45.720
is you can see I've got
this kind of loose here,

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:48.640
and I can tighten it as me be
with my clove hitch knot.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.440
I'm going to take my spindle,

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:54.120
and I'm going to twist
it into my paracord.

00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:56.000
Watch out, Nate.

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:57.060
Perfect.

00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:57.780
Okay.

00:08:58.060 --> 00:08:59.819
So this is a really
really good tension

00:08:59.819 --> 00:09:03.400
because it's tight,
still mobile though.

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:06.620
So what we'll do now,
I'll hold this.

00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:08.040
I'm going to take my left arm,

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:12.260
because I'm right-handed,
embrace it against my left leg.

00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:16.300
Get that spindle into that
little notch that Nate's made,

00:09:16.304 --> 00:09:17.480
take my palm rock,

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:19.700
goes on to the edge
of the spindle.

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:23.780
And now, believe it or not,
this is all been easy part.

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:26.660
This is the part that takes
a little bit of practice.

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:28.360
You're going to pull it.

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:31.400
You're going to pull it back
and forth pretty darn slow

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:33.660
until you see smoke.

00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:34.660
Once you see smoke,

00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:36.960
you want to keep
a really even pace.

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:41.400
Now this pace needs to last
for about 30 Strokes.

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:43.960
So you can kind of count
the ABC's in your head.

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:45.840
It's about the amount
of time it's going to take,

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:47.320
and as you do that,

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:50.300
the downward pressure of your
palm rock is very important.

00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:59.840
[Music]

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:01.792
So all that took was
really about 15 seconds.

00:10:01.792 --> 00:10:05.172
You can already see
that they've got some friction,

00:10:05.592 --> 00:10:07.200
and we've already
dark in the wood.

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:09.200
We've already have
a little bit of smoke.

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:11.120
So we're going to keep going.

00:10:11.132 --> 00:10:13.023
If at any point you're feeling

00:10:13.023 --> 00:10:16.300
like your bow string just
isn't staying tight enough,

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:20.780
it's pretty darn easy to take
your leftover paracord here,

00:10:21.152 --> 00:10:23.922
wrap it around
that clove hitch knot,

00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:28.340
and this is why you want
to use the more curved edge

00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:29.680
where your hand is,

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:32.400
because you can actually
tighten the string as you go.

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:40.600
[Music]

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:41.520
At this point, you can see

00:10:41.530 --> 00:10:44.236
that Calli has smoke coming
off of the spindle.

00:10:44.236 --> 00:10:46.923
What you're really looking
for in an ember is

00:10:46.923 --> 00:10:49.517
when you stop using the bow
and the spindle,

00:10:49.517 --> 00:10:52.507
you should see a thin stream
of smoke coming up.

00:10:52.507 --> 00:10:54.480
If you have a successful ember,

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:57.580
it will continue smoking
after you stop using the bow.

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:02.840
Still smoking, still smoking.

00:11:02.845 --> 00:11:03.611
Okay.

00:11:03.611 --> 00:11:04.552
Here's a chance.

00:11:06.292 --> 00:11:07.830
I may have an ember.

00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:11.811
It's still smoking?

00:11:11.811 --> 00:11:12.642
Little.

00:11:16.788 --> 00:11:18.326
Nope, that one died.

00:11:18.942 --> 00:11:20.622
All right, that's okay.

00:11:20.842 --> 00:11:23.650
Getting it on your first try
doesn't normally happen,

00:11:23.650 --> 00:11:27.072
but you could see
the smoke rising off of it,

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:28.900
and you can see,

00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:31.120
this has been
a sharpen point before...

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:32.900
We worked that way...

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:35.340
Very out of breath.

00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:38.620
We've worked that down
to almost a flat edge now.

00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:41.420
So that's what it looks
like to just a few passes.

00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:42.240
All right, Nate.

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:43.200
I'm tired.

00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:44.660
Wanna give it a shot?

00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:51.480
[Music]

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:52.460
Nice.

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.260
[inaudible] this one,

00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:01.580
There you go.

00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:02.720
Now, hold it up.

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:04.140
Don't breathe on it,
jus hold it up.

00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:05.072
There you go.

00:12:05.072 --> 00:12:05.750
See that?

00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:07.365
This is what we want.

00:12:07.365 --> 00:12:08.365
He's got one.

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:12.020
Okay, now stand up,

00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:14.580
and just sort of pass it
through the air back and forth.

00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:18.332
Gently and don't do this
over anything flammable.

00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:20.900
He's got a flame guys.

00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:21.700
He did it.

00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:33.580
[Music]

00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:35.040
I made fire.

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:37.720
He's advanced to
the level of caveman.

00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:38.760
Yes!

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:41.160
Now, obviously,

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:43.740
we weren't looking to create
a bonfire here today.

00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:46.140
But if you'd had a pile
of kindling ready to go,

00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:49.100
some nice dry wood and tinder,
this would have caught.

00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:50.420
You would have been good to go.

00:12:51.222 --> 00:12:53.579
So it's been a couple of days
since Nate and I showed you

00:12:53.579 --> 00:12:54.800
how to make a bow drill fire.

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:56.429
Now Grant wants to try.

00:12:56.429 --> 00:12:57.550
What can I say?

00:12:57.550 --> 00:12:58.692
I like fire.

00:12:58.692 --> 00:13:14.740
[Music]

00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:16.620
It's still smoking,
still smoking.

00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:18.140
Still smoking.

00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:19.032
Still smoking.

00:13:19.032 --> 00:13:19.752
Okay, cool.

00:13:19.752 --> 00:13:20.594
You got one.

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:22.400
Didn't say I was the best,

00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:25.900
but I do like making the fire.

00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:28.280
All right, very carefully here.

00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:43.400
[Music]

00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:45.700
It is just a little baby fire
waiting to happen.

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:48.342
You got to cradle it,
be gentle with it.

00:13:48.342 --> 00:13:52.220
[Music]

00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:53.192
That's a good sign.

00:13:53.200 --> 00:14:02.240
[Music]

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:03.082
Boom.

00:14:03.082 --> 00:14:06.740
[Music]

00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:07.880
There we go.

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:09.080
You finally warm-up.

00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:11.300
Burn these goosebumps away.

00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:13.412
Thank you, Calli.

00:14:13.682 --> 00:14:14.972
It works.

00:14:15.302 --> 00:14:17.805
So, just some thoughts
after having done that.

00:14:17.805 --> 00:14:21.276
The ember that I got to actually
start and catch on to that,

00:14:21.276 --> 00:14:22.100
it was little.

00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:24.417
There was quite a bit
of burned wood material.

00:14:24.417 --> 00:14:25.550
You probably saw that.

00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:28.306
It looked like it was
about the area of a dime,

00:14:28.306 --> 00:14:31.040
and stacked up maybe
quarter of an inch tall.

00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:31.840
So like there's a lot

00:14:31.850 --> 00:14:34.220
of stuff that looked
like it might have worked,

00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:36.760
but the actual ember,
the one that was still burning,

00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:40.280
that was about just this tiny
little glowing orange spot,

00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:43.902
and that's what we got to catch
and grow into all of the bark

00:14:43.902 --> 00:14:46.500
and the shredded dust
that we made out of it.

00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:48.750
And what you want to remember
there is there's one point

00:14:48.750 --> 00:14:51.000
where Nate even thought
it wasn't there anymore.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.100
The red glow doesn't stay.

00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:55.200
You've got to remember
that it's still surviving.

00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:56.955
So long as you can see smoke,

00:14:56.955 --> 00:14:59.648
chances are you still
probably have a viable ember.

00:14:59.648 --> 00:15:01.750
You still just need
to transfer it over,

00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:03.422
and let it sit
for a second,
