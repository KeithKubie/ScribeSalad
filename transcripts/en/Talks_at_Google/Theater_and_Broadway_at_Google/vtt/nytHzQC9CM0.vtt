MAHLET SEYOUM:
Without further ado,

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:08.138
I'm going to pass it
on to Neil Pepe, who

00:00:08.138 --> 00:00:12.170
is the artistic director of
the Atlantic Theater Company

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:13.780
and is also the
director of this show

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:16.196
to give you guys some background
about the theater company

00:00:16.196 --> 00:00:19.190
that's actually in this
building and then also introduce

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:19.690
the show.

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:21.090
So thank you guys.

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.650
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.590
NEIL PEPE: Thank you, Mahlet.

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:26.650
Yes, we are in fact
in this building.

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:28.840
We're very excited
to be up here and see

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:29.930
how incredible Google is.

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:32.140
So we are the Atlantic
Theater Company.

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:33.560
We were actually
in this building

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.690
before you guys moved in.

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:37.394
We've been around
about 30 years.

00:00:37.394 --> 00:00:39.060
We're a theater company
that was founded

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:43.070
by the playwright David Mamet
and the actor William H. Macy.

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.490
And we do a lot of new
plays and revivals.

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:49.690
And we have two theaters.

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:53.430
One, you've probably seen
downstairs in 16th Street.

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.230
It's our Stage 2, and it's 16th
between 8th and 9th Avenue,

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.700
and that's where we
do our Stage 2 shows.

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.410
And the other is on 20th
Street between 8th and 9th,

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.330
and that's where Marie
and Rosetta is happening.

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.980
Some of you may
have heard of some

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:11.820
of the more well-known shows
that we've done at our theater.

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.970
"Spring Awakening," the
musical, started with us.

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.109
And we do, as I said, we've
developed a bunch of musicals.

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:21.650
We've developed a
bunch of new plays.

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.650
We've also done quite a
few authors from England.

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.130
We did the Martin McDonagh
play, "Beauty Queen of Leenane,"

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.730
which also moved to
Broadway, and the "Lieutenant

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:31.000
of Inishmore."

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.530
And we're also-- we
run a big school.

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.750
We have a studio through NYU.

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.401
And so we have a
three-year program.

00:01:39.401 --> 00:01:41.150
And I think we even
have some Googlers who

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.770
are taking some of our
part-time conservatory program

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:45.460
downstairs.

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:46.959
So we run a large
school, and you'll

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:50.030
see students coming up and
down the elevator sometime.

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:51.590
Plus we have a kids program.

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.270
We're currently running a show
called "1001 Nights," which

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.530
is written by Bobby Lopez,
who some of you may know

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.300
wrote the "Book of Mormon,"
and "Avenue Q," and "Frozen."

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.660
And that just actually
opened this past week

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:07.300
and is going very well.

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.669
And it's happening on top of
the set of "Marie and Rosetta"

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:12.670
on Saturday and Sunday mornings.

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.210
And so come by and
check that out.

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:18.100
Yeah, we're all about new plays.

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.650
And "Marie and Rosetta"
is a great new play.

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.480
It's written by George Brant.

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.310
I was sent the play last year
from a producer friend of mine,

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.220
and I knew about George's work.

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.940
George wrote a play
called "Grounded,"

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.320
that was at the Public
Theater last season with Anne

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.890
Hathaway about drone bombing.

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.580
And he's a wonderful writer.

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.160
And so I wasn't quite sure what
to expect when I got this play.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.480
And I read it, and I thought
this is kind of extraordinary.

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.690
Here is this amazing woman,
Sister Rosetta Tharpe,

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.250
who has been dubbed the
godmother of rock and roll,

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.460
and I had never heard of her.

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.100
And I consider myself
to be a rock and roll

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.570
fan and a fan of blues music
and a fan of gospel music.

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:01.100
And so then I immediately--
thanks to you guys, I

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:02.470
went to YouTube.

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.210
And I started researching more
about Sister Rosetta Tharpe,

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:10.450
and, lo and behold, there were
all these incredible songs.

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.260
And here was this
amazing woman who

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.320
started in gospel in
the 1930s and then

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.650
kind of moved into more popular
music in the 40s and 50s.

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.300
And not only was she
a great songwriter

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.490
and a great vocalist, but as
you'll see, if you YouTube her,

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:29.070
or if you come and see the show,
she was an amazing guitarist.

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:33.780
And so in the late 30s,
here was this woman who

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.140
took out an electric guitar and
played it like nobody really

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.720
played it before and--
what we found out later--

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.520
ended up influencing people like
Jimi Hendrix and Chuck Berry.

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.640
I was amazed because I'd
been a huge Chuck Berry

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.600
fan and a lot of the riffs that
Chuck Berry plays are directly

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.790
from Sister Rosetta.

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.750
So here was this play that
was not only celebrating

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.610
this woman, who
sadly is not known,

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:03.590
but it was also talking
about the history

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:05.450
of 20th-century music.

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:08.020
And it was
celebrating two women,

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:11.150
because it concentrates on the
meeting between Sister Rosetta

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.960
and another phenomenal
singer called Marie Knight.

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:17.399
And they got together
and sort of performed

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:20.410
as a duo in the late 40s.

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:22.570
And so the play
concentrates on that.

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:25.600
And what George was able to
do is kind of compress a lot

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.480
of factual information
about their relationship

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:32.200
and then show us some of
the songs that Rosetta wrote

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.800
and talk a little bit
about Marie Knight as well.

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.300
So for us it was a
great opportunity,

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.010
because we're all
about telling stories

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:42.310
that we think are
important to be told,

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:44.250
and we're about
celebrating great writing

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.320
and the truth of great writing.

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:49.060
This was an amazing
story to tell.

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:53.710
And just the fact that--
well, I should also say we

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:57.770
feel blessed to have these
incredible performers.

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:00.880
The fact that these
women were not known

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:04.220
and then for all of us to come
together and celebrate them

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:06.470
was a big deal for us.

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:11.410
So what we want to do today is
have some of our cast members

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:14.960
and Deah Harriott, our piano
player, do some of the numbers.

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:18.100
We're going to do three
different numbers for you.

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:21.760
And the people who are
going to be performing them

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:25.340
are Miss Kecia Lewis, and
Miss Rebecca Naomi Jones,

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:26.430
and Miss Deah Harriott.

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:27.950
So come on up, guys.

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:37.890
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:40.680

00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:45.160
KECIA LEWIS: So that was one
of their biggest hits together.

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:48.430
And you're going to
introduce the second one?

00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:49.180
What are we doing?

00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:49.426
REBECCA NAOMI
JONES: Oh, I thought

00:08:49.426 --> 00:08:50.426
you were introducing it.

00:08:50.426 --> 00:08:51.070
I can.

00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:51.465
NEIL PEPE: The ballad.

00:08:51.465 --> 00:08:51.740
KECIA LEWIS: The ballad?

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:52.410
Yeah, oh me.

00:08:52.410 --> 00:08:53.230
I'm introducing.

00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:55.220
Yeah, yeah, I said I was
going to introduce it.

00:08:55.220 --> 00:09:00.920
So there's-- something factual
about Sister Rosetta was that

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:03.050
she was very close with
her mother, Mother Bell,

00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:04.060
she called her.

00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:06.300
Katie Bell Nubin was her mother.

00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:10.670
And Mother Bell was
very instrumental

00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:14.740
in Rosetta feeling
and having the freedom

00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:17.570
to not just sing in the
church where she grew up,

00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:20.810
but to be able to utilize
her gifts in other areas

00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:23.080
and other genres of music.

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:28.090
And that closeness
was very palpable

00:09:28.090 --> 00:09:29.560
between the two of them.

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:31.620
And this song that
we're about to do

00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:37.210
is-- in the context of the play,
Mother Bell has recently died.

00:09:37.210 --> 00:09:40.800
And Rosetta sees
Marie as someone

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:43.670
that Mother Bell would
have loved to know

00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:45.580
that Rosetta was connected to.

00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:48.760
So there's a moment in
the play where I tell her

00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:51.620
that my mother has died,
and I ask her would you

00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:55.320
sing something so that my
mother can meet you spiritually.

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:57.341
So that's what this song is.

00:09:57.341 --> 00:09:59.091

[APPLAUSE]

00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:33.090
REBECCA NAOMI JONES:
And this last song

00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:37.140
is a little bit of a taste
of those kinds of other songs

00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:39.060
that Sister Rosetta
was encouraged

00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:44.080
to do both by record
companies and also by her

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:50.200
Mother Bell, who encouraged her
to praise in any way she knew.

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:52.810
So Rosetta did go out
into the real world,

00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:56.160
as it were, and she did some
records with bigger bands

00:13:56.160 --> 00:14:00.780
and stuff that was a little
more-- or a lot more secular.

00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:04.330
So in the context of our
show at a certain point

00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:10.070
Marie, who has previously
allowed herself

00:14:10.070 --> 00:14:16.870
to seem very, very, very sacred
and very afraid of these kinds

00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:20.160
of secular songs
reveals to Rosetta

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:22.720
that she actually
loves these other songs

00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:26.470
and asks Rosetta to
sing one with her.

00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:26.980
Here it is.

you guys so much.

00:16:26.530 --> 00:16:28.290
I got to see it a
second time, and it's

00:16:28.290 --> 00:16:31.290
even more incredible to see
you guys up close and just

00:16:31.290 --> 00:16:31.969
in your element.

00:16:31.969 --> 00:16:33.510
I have a ton of
questions, but I want

00:16:33.510 --> 00:16:36.430
to make sure I give you all
time for questions as well.

00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:40.910
And I had a first question, but
after seeing you guys perform

00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:42.890
so incredibly, the
first question I

00:16:42.890 --> 00:16:45.460
have is about your
musical process.

00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:48.910
Music is such a huge part
of this show, obviously,

00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:52.300
and I'm not someone who has a
really big background in music,

00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:55.070
so I'd love to hear about what
you guys went through, what

00:16:55.070 --> 00:16:57.870
the relationship
and dynamic was, a

00:16:57.870 --> 00:17:01.614
and what was important
to you in this process.

00:17:01.614 --> 00:17:03.780
NEIL PEPE: Well, I should
say, for those of you that

00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:07.079
don't know, I mean all these
guys have incredible acting

00:17:07.079 --> 00:17:08.780
backgrounds and
music backgrounds.

00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:10.560
I knew Kecia's work.

00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:12.740
You were in the
original "Dreamgirls,"

00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:15.550
"Once on this Island,"
"Leap of Faith."

00:17:15.550 --> 00:17:18.645
Last year she did an amazing
"Mother Courage" at CSC.

00:17:18.645 --> 00:17:20.270
KECIA LEWIS: It was
actually this year.

00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:20.560
NEIL PEPE: This year?

00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:22.210
Yeah, it was this year she did.

00:17:22.210 --> 00:17:23.280
Yeah, earlier this year.

00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:24.160
January.

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:27.160
And so Kecia not only has a
great background as an actor,

00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:29.440
but a great background,
obviously, as a singer.

00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:31.760
And then Rebecca's
work I knew very well

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:34.380
from "American
Idiot," she was in,

00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:37.690
and "Passing Strange,"
and "Murder Ballad," that

00:17:37.690 --> 00:17:39.685
was over first at
Manhattan Theater Club then

00:17:39.685 --> 00:17:41.080
at Union Square.

00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:44.624
And also knew her not just
as a musical theater actor,

00:17:44.624 --> 00:17:45.290
but as an actor.

00:17:45.290 --> 00:17:47.760
So they both had great
music background.

00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:50.650
And then I was introduced
to the lovely Deah Harriott

00:17:50.650 --> 00:17:53.020
by Jason Michael Webb,
our music director.

00:17:53.020 --> 00:17:56.368
And you guys knew each other--
was it through the church?

00:17:56.368 --> 00:18:01.800
DEAH HARRIOTT: Through-- we
just met through musical friends

00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:05.020
and in Jersey, actually,
because I lived there first,

00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:06.294
and I met Jason there.

00:18:06.294 --> 00:18:07.710
NEIL PEPE: And we
were so excited,

00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:11.080
because Deah's background
is both classically trained,

00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:12.990
but has played a lot
of gospel, right?

00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:14.490
DEAH HARRIOTT: Yes,
yes, definitely.

00:18:14.490 --> 00:18:17.260
Started playing
gospel around age 7.

00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:18.770
Was classically
trained from age 3.

00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:22.669
And then just kind of melded
and meshed the two together.

00:18:22.669 --> 00:18:24.960
NEIL PEPE: And then, finally,
the one person that's not

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:26.080
here is Felicia Collins.

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:28.280
And she does all the
guitar stuff in the show.

00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:30.609
And she was David Letterman's
guitarist-- some of you

00:18:30.609 --> 00:18:32.400
may know her from that--
for, I don't know,

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:34.110
20, 23 years, or something.

00:18:34.110 --> 00:18:36.420
So the reason I bring up all
these backgrounds in terms

00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:39.690
of the question is because we're
talking about Sister Rosetta

00:18:39.690 --> 00:18:42.990
Tharpe, who was very much
anchored in gospel music

00:18:42.990 --> 00:18:45.090
and then made this transition
into popular music.

00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:47.380
And then pretty much
on her own started

00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:50.010
developing something that people
later called rock and roll.

00:18:50.010 --> 00:18:52.720
The final-- one of the
last songs in the show

00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:55.260
called, "Strange
Things," some historians

00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:57.270
label as the first
rock and roll song,

00:18:57.270 --> 00:18:59.480
even though she cut it in 1946.

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:01.510
So I think part of
our process-- at least

00:19:01.510 --> 00:19:05.400
for me-- was to have all
of these amazing musicians,

00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:10.060
singers, talented actors,
who could not only

00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:12.720
do their jobs as actors and
musicians incredibly well--

00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:15.320
and I was so fortunate to have
them to work with-- but it felt

00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:19.150
like such a great kind
of coming together

00:19:19.150 --> 00:19:21.460
of people who
understood the music,

00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:25.541
both the sort of rockier,
bluesier stuff and the gospel

00:19:25.541 --> 00:19:26.040
stuff.

00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:27.740
And another
interesting thing I'll

00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:30.280
say-- which these guys
always-- I mention,

00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:33.270
and they hassle me about is I
have no religious background.

00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:36.186
And so part of my experience
of working on this play,

00:19:36.186 --> 00:19:38.060
not only learning from
the play, but learning

00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:41.510
from these guys a little
bit was about gospel music

00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:43.790
and about spiritual music.

00:19:43.790 --> 00:19:47.370
And it became a very,
very meaningful process

00:19:47.370 --> 00:19:52.700
for me both musically and
storywise to get into that.

00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:58.010
So and, finally, I would say
the music is so exciting--

00:19:58.010 --> 00:20:00.960
and, hopefully, as you can
hear just from the three songs

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:03.500
you heard, but if you get a
chance to see the show itself,

00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:05.067
this music still lives.

00:20:05.067 --> 00:20:07.400
I mean if you go on YouTube
and listen to Sister Rosetta

00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:10.690
or come see this show,
these songs are not dated.

00:20:10.690 --> 00:20:13.120
And I think that's one
of the reasons they

00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:14.490
felt so ahead of their time.

00:20:14.490 --> 00:20:16.780
They're so alive
and and fantastic.

00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:20.997
But-- you want to
jump in about it?

00:20:20.997 --> 00:20:22.580
KECIA LEWIS: Neil
so eloquently talked

00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:24.920
about some of my
musical background.

00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:27.680
I grew up in the church, so
gospel music was very much

00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:30.610
a part of my life growing up.

00:20:30.610 --> 00:20:36.980
And my mother knew
of Sister Rosetta.

00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:38.590
That's more her era.

00:20:38.590 --> 00:20:41.550
And my mother listened to her.

00:20:41.550 --> 00:20:44.570
And as we were in this
process what I discovered

00:20:44.570 --> 00:20:48.680
was a lot of the stuff that I
remember my mother humming was

00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:51.318
some of this music,
which she would just

00:20:51.318 --> 00:20:54.580
hum it doing dishes or
being around the house.

00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:56.340
But it's amazing to me.

00:20:56.340 --> 00:21:00.190
And again, it speaks to
the endurance of this music

00:21:00.190 --> 00:21:03.950
that it feels like we could
have wrote this this year,

00:21:03.950 --> 00:21:07.220
and it's very much,
very much alive.

00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:10.220
And so for me
working on this music

00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:14.960
was very organic to who
I already am and just

00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:21.080
trying to figure out how to
bring some of myself to it,

00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:23.020
as well as honoring
Rosetta without trying

00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:26.250
to copy her or mimic
her in any way,

00:21:26.250 --> 00:21:30.160
but to do some of the things
that she did in the music.

00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:33.680
Jason was-- as I was
learning the music,

00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:38.020
our musical director, Jason,
we had worked together before,

00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:39.100
so he knows me.

00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:42.790
And he was like, OK, this riff
sounds like you that she does,

00:21:42.790 --> 00:21:44.010
so do this riff.

00:21:44.010 --> 00:21:44.860
Do this one.

00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:47.226
And then this one, that's
not so good in your voice.

00:21:47.226 --> 00:21:48.350
So maybe don't do that one.

00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:49.550
Do a Kecia thing there.

00:21:49.550 --> 00:21:51.100
That kind of thing, you know.

00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:55.510
So it was very much
collaborative and able to speak

00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:58.420
to who I was as a person,
as well as who Rosetta

00:21:58.420 --> 00:22:01.739
was and honoring she and Marie.

00:22:01.739 --> 00:22:03.780
REBECCA NAOMI JONES: I
think the only other thing

00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:08.410
that I think is worth adding is
that what I loved about working

00:22:08.410 --> 00:22:13.446
on the music in this process
was that the way we approached

00:22:13.446 --> 00:22:15.320
the songs, of course,
is the way you approach

00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:16.930
a song in a musical,
right, so how

00:22:16.930 --> 00:22:18.180
is it going to tell the story.

00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:20.170
So a lot of what I have
to sing, especially

00:22:20.170 --> 00:22:22.280
in the beginning of the
play is very straight.

00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:23.940
No riffs.

00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:25.750
In fact, some of this
stuff is like songs

00:22:25.750 --> 00:22:28.041
that we have-- the recordings
of them, there are riffs,

00:22:28.041 --> 00:22:32.660
but we took them out, because
Marie is so contained,

00:22:32.660 --> 00:22:35.680
especially for a large
portion of the play,

00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:39.280
and so that was really exciting
for me to work on stuff

00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:44.150
where I had to really just
use economy with singing

00:22:44.150 --> 00:22:48.810
and really just tell the
story and use the words.

00:22:48.810 --> 00:22:52.230
And I love the way George chose
which songs go into the play,

00:22:52.230 --> 00:22:57.320
because it really allows us
to grow within the music.

00:22:57.320 --> 00:23:00.440
I mean it really, like, I
have these quiet, quiet songs,

00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:03.212
and then I get to sing
more and more broad stuff,

00:23:03.212 --> 00:23:05.420
and then we get to groove
together and cook together,

00:23:05.420 --> 00:23:07.710
which is really cool.

00:23:07.710 --> 00:23:10.760
So I would say that
would be my journey

00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:12.250
with the music in the show.

00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:15.810
DEAH HARRIOTT: Oh,
all I'll just say

00:23:15.810 --> 00:23:20.190
is that I think that they placed
a lot of faith in our collabo

00:23:20.190 --> 00:23:22.670
here, because I
always explain this

00:23:22.670 --> 00:23:26.200
like an organized, an arranged
marriage that just happens

00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:29.852
to work, because we
all really do get along

00:23:29.852 --> 00:23:30.810
and we love each other.

00:23:30.810 --> 00:23:34.050
And it's such an intimate
setting, if you see the show.

00:23:34.050 --> 00:23:36.830
And to have the two
vocalist actresses

00:23:36.830 --> 00:23:40.020
and two musicians it's just--
you're very vulnerable.

00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:42.990
And it's just you
and the audience.

00:23:42.990 --> 00:23:46.580
So you feel like every mistake
or anything that is heard

00:23:46.580 --> 00:23:48.170
is just supposed to be there.

00:23:48.170 --> 00:23:51.980
And so I would just say
that it really, really--

00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:56.370
just like Rebecca said,
you have to really know

00:23:56.370 --> 00:23:57.630
what to take out of yourself.

00:23:57.630 --> 00:23:58.630
Know what to add in.

00:23:58.630 --> 00:24:00.130
Not add too much.

00:24:00.130 --> 00:24:03.080
And in the riffing
age of today, you

00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:05.490
have to just water it down
and take all that out and just

00:24:05.490 --> 00:24:08.540
be plain and vulnerable, just
let your true musicianship

00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:09.370
show.

00:24:09.370 --> 00:24:10.960
And you can tell that
we're married, because look

00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:11.876
at what we're wearing.

00:24:11.876 --> 00:24:12.786
We didn't plan this.

00:24:12.786 --> 00:24:13.620
KECIA LEWIS: We
didn't coordinate.

00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:14.450
DEAH HARRIOTT:
We're all matching.

00:24:14.450 --> 00:24:15.120
KECIA LEWIS: This was creepy.

00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:16.620
DEAH HARRIOTT: It was--
it's a little creepy.

00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:16.720
KECIA LEWIS: I was like, really?

00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:17.220
For real?

00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:17.345
DEAH HARRIOTT: What's going on?

00:24:17.345 --> 00:24:18.880
What is this?

00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:21.530
KECIA LEWIS: We're like
turning into each other.

00:24:21.530 --> 00:24:22.770
It's creepy.

00:24:22.770 --> 00:24:25.412
MAHLET SEYOUM: So, Kecia, you
brought up the fact that when

00:24:25.412 --> 00:24:26.870
you were singing
whether or not you

00:24:26.870 --> 00:24:29.280
and the musical director
deciding when to bring in Kecia

00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:30.738
and when to bring
in Sister Rosetta

00:24:30.738 --> 00:24:33.160
and that that brings in a
really interesting question

00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:35.599
around the fact that you
guys are playing real people,

00:24:35.599 --> 00:24:36.640
that you could go online.

00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:37.370
You could research.

00:24:37.370 --> 00:24:39.310
You could watch videos, as
you mentioned, on YouTube,

00:24:39.310 --> 00:24:40.830
and you can get
their own essence.

00:24:40.830 --> 00:24:44.900
So how much did that
play a role and a factor

00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:48.560
in your own process of
taking on this role and kind

00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:49.800
of developing in rehearsals?

00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:51.430
And how much of
yourself did you bring

00:24:51.430 --> 00:24:55.720
of it versus Sister
Rosetta and Marie?

00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:58.490
KECIA LEWIS: For
me as an actor I

00:24:58.490 --> 00:25:00.700
like to work from
the inside out,

00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:08.120
generally, so as I watched her
videos and read some about her

00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:12.090
and thought about
who she was, I found

00:25:12.090 --> 00:25:15.210
that she and I were very
much alike in a lot of ways.

00:25:15.210 --> 00:25:20.420
So I wanted to honor
that part of her that

00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:22.200
really was a pioneer,
and she didn't even

00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:23.520
know she was a pioneer.

00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:25.450
She was just doing
her thing, you know,

00:25:25.450 --> 00:25:28.040
and enjoying being a
musician and being a singer.

00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:33.200
So for me it was
preparing myself

00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:37.220
in a way to bring myself
the parts of me that

00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:39.410
were like her to the table.

00:25:39.410 --> 00:25:43.140
And Neil as our director told
us from the very beginning,

00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:46.530
I'm not looking for you
guys to imitate these ladies

00:25:46.530 --> 00:25:53.040
or to try to recreate who they
were, but we're honoring them.

00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:56.940
So you bring who you are
and honor them in that way.

00:25:56.940 --> 00:25:59.000
And that was very freeing.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:05.200
And it also helped
me to just try

00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:08.490
to open myself up
spiritually to what do

00:26:08.490 --> 00:26:10.200
you want me to say about you.

00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:15.220
What do you want people to
know about you now in 2016?

00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:20.950
And just let that be what
people receive from my end.

00:26:20.950 --> 00:26:21.729
So.

00:26:21.729 --> 00:26:22.770
MAHLET SEYOUM: Thank you.

00:26:22.770 --> 00:26:25.210
REBECCA NAOMI JONES: There
isn't really much out there

00:26:25.210 --> 00:26:26.300
on Marie Knight.

00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:30.690
There's not a ton of
footage or any of that.

00:26:30.690 --> 00:26:34.690
But I did have photographs
and some recordings,

00:26:34.690 --> 00:26:37.150
and I think that
stuff always helps.

00:26:37.150 --> 00:26:39.900
Just when you see the way a
person carried themselves.

00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:45.650
Marie has this pose that
she does in a lot of photos.

00:26:45.650 --> 00:26:48.834
I mean like a lot of
photos-- like every photo.

00:26:48.834 --> 00:26:49.875
But it's like variations.

00:26:49.875 --> 00:26:50.970
It' It'll be like this.

00:26:50.970 --> 00:26:53.746
Or it'll be like this.

00:26:53.746 --> 00:26:56.380
But it's always at least
one arm is doing this.

00:26:56.380 --> 00:26:57.170
But for no reason.

00:26:57.170 --> 00:26:58.364
And to whom?

00:26:58.364 --> 00:27:01.780
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:07.660
But it's great, because I saw
in her this delicateness, which

00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:10.090
I don't know that I
necessarily carry in my body.

00:27:10.090 --> 00:27:11.270
And that helped me a lot.

00:27:11.270 --> 00:27:11.978
That informed me.

00:27:11.978 --> 00:27:16.760
And, of course, the words that I
speak that are on the page also

00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:17.430
indicate that.

00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:19.609
But there's a way
that you see someone--

00:27:19.609 --> 00:27:21.400
the way they carry
themselves, the way they

00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:24.470
wear their clothes that
can really teach you a lot.

00:27:24.470 --> 00:27:27.420
And of course just hearing the
recordings are helpful, too.

00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:29.420
I mean not in terms of--
I'm not going to change

00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:30.760
the way my voice sounds.

00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:35.640
She's got a different kind
of timbre of voice than I do.

00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:39.010
But that stuff is
just fun to get

00:27:39.010 --> 00:27:44.120
into the world of the
character for sure.

00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:45.820
Yeah, that's it for me.

00:27:45.820 --> 00:27:47.120
MAHLET SEYOUM: Thank you

00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:49.590
Neil mentioned earlier
that the Atlantic Theater

00:27:49.590 --> 00:27:51.370
Company focuses
mainly on new works,

00:27:51.370 --> 00:27:53.010
and this is actually a new work.

00:27:53.010 --> 00:27:56.550
It was the world premiere of
this show and of this piece

00:27:56.550 --> 00:27:58.050
of work.

00:27:58.050 --> 00:28:00.210
Can you talk a bit
about how working

00:28:00.210 --> 00:28:02.880
with a completely
new piece of work,

00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:05.730
being the premier theater
to bring that to light

00:28:05.730 --> 00:28:08.360
and to the stage, how
that differs from revivals

00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:10.470
and from works that have
been produced many times?

00:28:10.470 --> 00:28:12.845
And you actually worked as I
understand it pretty closely

00:28:12.845 --> 00:28:15.330
with the playwright, so can
you talk a bit about that?

00:28:15.330 --> 00:28:16.496
NEIL PEPE: Yeah, absolutely.

00:28:16.496 --> 00:28:19.570
I mean it's always thrilling
to work on a new work,

00:28:19.570 --> 00:28:23.480
because not only are you-- it's
the first life of the show,

00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:26.550
and you're trying to figure
out how the story operates.

00:28:26.550 --> 00:28:29.880
But it's the first time these
characters have ever been seen.

00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:32.470
So with the actors
and the musicians

00:28:32.470 --> 00:28:35.230
you're kind of creating this
thing for the first time.

00:28:35.230 --> 00:28:36.980
And that's exciting.

00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:39.780
As opposed to plays
that you've seen a lot

00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:42.770
and maybe you're trying to--
like we were talking about,

00:28:42.770 --> 00:28:44.810
find our truth
within those plays.

00:28:44.810 --> 00:28:48.170
But to do it for the first
time is a fascinating process.

00:28:48.170 --> 00:28:51.670
One connection, because
Mahlet went to Stanford--

00:28:51.670 --> 00:28:55.950
we started-- I did a workshop
of this play in a little theater

00:28:55.950 --> 00:28:57.860
in Palo Alto called
Theater Works, which

00:28:57.860 --> 00:28:59.590
is a wonderful theater
there that also

00:28:59.590 --> 00:29:01.140
has a developmental program.

00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:04.720
So about just over a year ago,
George and I went out there,

00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:07.450
and he had a basically
finished draft.

00:29:07.450 --> 00:29:09.090
He was still making
some tweaks, but we

00:29:09.090 --> 00:29:12.900
did two weeks of rehearsal out
there with a couple of actors--

00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:14.290
local actors-- there.

00:29:14.290 --> 00:29:18.410
And had the chance to
kind of do a reading

00:29:18.410 --> 00:29:20.100
and sing it in front of people.

00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:25.110
But it was our first taste
of how it operated as a story

00:29:25.110 --> 00:29:27.629
and really looking at
what the conflict was.

00:29:27.629 --> 00:29:29.420
And one of the hardest
things about working

00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:32.800
on a play like
this is form wise,

00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:36.060
it can take on what people
call a jukebox musical sort

00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:38.539
of structure, meaning
you have existing songs

00:29:38.539 --> 00:29:40.580
and you're trying to sort
of string them together

00:29:40.580 --> 00:29:41.410
with a story.

00:29:41.410 --> 00:29:43.970
And one of the things that I
really appreciate, and I think

00:29:43.970 --> 00:29:47.440
George is great at
is taking the essence

00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:50.510
of this story between
these two women

00:29:50.510 --> 00:29:52.870
and where they were
each at in their lives.

00:29:52.870 --> 00:29:54.706
Because I think in the
context of the play--

00:29:54.706 --> 00:29:56.080
as we talked about
in rehearsal--

00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:58.410
they're both at a
crossroads in their lives.

00:29:58.410 --> 00:30:01.240
One at the middle
of her career, one

00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:02.850
at the beginning of her career.

00:30:02.850 --> 00:30:06.680
And both career wise, as
women, in relationships--

00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:10.110
they talk about
marriage-- they're

00:30:10.110 --> 00:30:12.640
seeking different
things from each other.

00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:16.340
And so trying to figure out
that arc and the conflict

00:30:16.340 --> 00:30:20.000
and how to dramatize
it, but also

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:23.230
with George, how to make sure
that it was always tight.

00:30:23.230 --> 00:30:25.730
And the other thing I'll say
about George as a writer, which

00:30:25.730 --> 00:30:28.670
I really appreciated, he's very
much like many great writers,

00:30:28.670 --> 00:30:30.110
a language writer.

00:30:30.110 --> 00:30:33.680
And there's a rhythm to his
language, which, I think,

00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:36.660
again these guys have
taken on so beautifully.

00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:39.400
And George will-- when
he was making changes

00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:42.100
during this process-- he didn't
make huge changes, because most

00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:45.310
of it was there, but
sometimes to great frustration

00:30:45.310 --> 00:30:47.860
for the actors, he would
change tiny little things.

00:30:47.860 --> 00:30:50.190
And we would be in previews
and Kecia had learned

00:30:50.190 --> 00:30:52.794
all these lines and then he'd
change up like two or three

00:30:52.794 --> 00:30:53.960
little words, rhythmically--

00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:54.350
KECIA LEWIS: Or switch them.

00:30:54.350 --> 00:30:55.170
NEIL PEPE: Or just switch them.

00:30:55.170 --> 00:30:56.140
Yeah.

00:30:56.140 --> 00:30:57.922
So that sometimes can
be the hardest thing

00:30:57.922 --> 00:30:59.630
to learn because you've
learn it one way.

00:30:59.630 --> 00:31:03.220
But he did it because he
was very cognizant of how

00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:06.520
rhythmically it works,
and also, I think,

00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:10.170
aware of that same
word, economy.

00:31:10.170 --> 00:31:12.920
Because I think George was
very concerned about getting

00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:15.930
to the truth of who
these characters were.

00:31:15.930 --> 00:31:19.780
And I think he was also--
George being a white man,

00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:24.890
he was also very, very kind
of shy and a little insecure

00:31:24.890 --> 00:31:29.020
about working on this play
about these extraordinary

00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:30.210
African-American women.

00:31:30.210 --> 00:31:33.360
And so, I think, in
the whole process,

00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:37.040
we were both trying to--
like Kecia was saying--

00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:41.310
keep our hearts and
our sense of truth

00:31:41.310 --> 00:31:46.420
open to really be able
to represent and honor

00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:47.700
who these women were.

00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:50.600
And yet, also, as we
were all talking about

00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:55.160
try to bring the truth of
who we are to sort of merge.

00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:58.050
So a lot of those
kinds of things

00:31:58.050 --> 00:32:00.169
you think about when you're
working on new plays.

00:32:00.169 --> 00:32:01.210
MAHLET SEYOUM: Thank you.

00:32:01.210 --> 00:32:02.960
I actually just recently
read an article,

00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:05.450
and I believe Kecia, you were
quoted in it, about George

00:32:05.450 --> 00:32:06.991
where he was talking
about just that,

00:32:06.991 --> 00:32:09.220
about him being a
bit hesitant at first

00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:11.900
about writing a
story such as this,

00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:13.370
being as he was a white male.

00:32:13.370 --> 00:32:15.820
And you-- correct me,
if I'm wrong-- saying

00:32:15.820 --> 00:32:18.550
that you appreciated the
fact that he took that pause

00:32:18.550 --> 00:32:20.107
and that he thought about it.

00:32:20.107 --> 00:32:21.690
Do want to just
elaborate a bit on it?

00:32:21.690 --> 00:32:23.950
KECIA LEWIS: Yeah,
I just thought, I'm

00:32:23.950 --> 00:32:27.840
very moved by George
as a human being.

00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:30.770
And I don't know him well,
but I spent a lot of time

00:32:30.770 --> 00:32:32.820
with him as we were
working on the play.

00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:36.600
And the fact that he
was conscious enough

00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:41.350
to be concerned that his
perspective as a white male

00:32:41.350 --> 00:32:43.920
quote, unquote, and
in this country,

00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:46.470
you know him even
being concerned,

00:32:46.470 --> 00:32:48.290
what right do I have
to tell the story.

00:32:48.290 --> 00:32:50.400
Is it OK if I tell the story?

00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:53.800
That speaks volumes
to me about his heart.

00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:59.920
And so I think that that very
heart is what's in the play.

00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:04.460
And the fact that he is
such a thoughtful person.

00:33:04.460 --> 00:33:06.490
There's a section
in the play where

00:33:06.490 --> 00:33:08.490
Marie talks about her kids.

00:33:08.490 --> 00:33:10.570
And I'm a mom.

00:33:10.570 --> 00:33:12.030
And he got it right.

00:33:12.030 --> 00:33:14.620
And I was, like, dude,
you don't have kids.

00:33:14.620 --> 00:33:15.550
You're not a mom.

00:33:15.550 --> 00:33:16.350
You're not black.

00:33:16.350 --> 00:33:18.040
Where you get that from?

00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:19.250
How did you get that?

00:33:19.250 --> 00:33:20.460
He's like, I don't know.

00:33:20.460 --> 00:33:23.000
I just kind of thought
that's what a mom would feel,

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:26.140
that's how a mom
would be concerned.

00:33:26.140 --> 00:33:32.720
So I think that being conscious
and conscientious about what

00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:34.290
you're doing and
the reason you're

00:33:34.290 --> 00:33:37.120
doing it that is a huge part.

00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:41.390
And George was-- also, another
thing that I love about him--

00:33:41.390 --> 00:33:47.750
his whole impetus was why
hasn't anybody told this story?

00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:50.710
Why don't I know
who this woman is?

00:33:50.710 --> 00:33:52.640
People need to know who she is.

00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:53.630
That speaks volumes.

00:33:53.630 --> 00:33:57.460
Not I need to write a play about
someone so I can make a dollar.

00:33:57.460 --> 00:34:00.700
Or I need to jump on this
bandwagon of African-American--

00:34:00.700 --> 00:34:02.620
or whatever people say.

00:34:02.620 --> 00:34:05.580
And that just speaks
volumes about his heart

00:34:05.580 --> 00:34:08.199
and who he is as a
writer and as a human.

00:34:08.199 --> 00:34:11.370
And as an actor it's
just a privilege

00:34:11.370 --> 00:34:13.908
to be able to work
with someone like that.

00:34:13.908 --> 00:34:15.840
MAHLET SEYOUM: Yeah, I agree.

00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:17.129
And on that note.

00:34:17.129 --> 00:34:18.670
The play deals--
and for those of you

00:34:18.670 --> 00:34:21.169
who have seen it, know-- the
play deals with a lot of really

00:34:21.169 --> 00:34:24.760
complex themes, not only about
race, but about sexuality,

00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:29.820
about illness, death, but also
joy, and praise and gospel.

00:34:29.820 --> 00:34:33.734
So how much of all of that do
you take into consideration

00:34:33.734 --> 00:34:36.150
when you decide whether or not
you want to take this role?

00:34:36.150 --> 00:34:37.620
Does that kind of excite you?

00:34:37.620 --> 00:34:41.570
Is that something that maybe
makes you apprehensive?

00:34:41.570 --> 00:34:44.590
Like what is the draw
around those kind

00:34:44.590 --> 00:34:47.381
of complex themes in stories?

00:34:47.381 --> 00:34:49.130
REBECCA NAOMI JONES:
There's so much draw.

00:34:49.130 --> 00:34:53.980
I think any piece of
theater that deals

00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:57.650
with more than one
theme is very exciting

00:34:57.650 --> 00:34:58.732
and it is the way to go.

00:34:58.732 --> 00:35:00.060
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:00.060 --> 00:35:05.040
It's easy in what we do,
especially in musical theater

00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:05.769
to--

00:35:05.769 --> 00:35:06.810
NEIL PEPE: Play one note.

00:35:06.810 --> 00:35:07.690
REBECCA NAOMI JONES:
Play one note.

00:35:07.690 --> 00:35:08.189
Yeah.

00:35:08.189 --> 00:35:11.580
And that gets old and boring
and doesn't turn you on.

00:35:11.580 --> 00:35:12.960
And this play turns us on.

00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:17.710
I mean there are all of these
complexities within the play.

00:35:17.710 --> 00:35:20.400
And the play-- what I love
about this play so much

00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:23.664
is that it feels like it's going
to be one thing, especially

00:35:23.664 --> 00:35:26.080
if you were to just describe
to somebody what this play is

00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:28.942
about-- it's a rehearsal between
these two women, who have just

00:35:28.942 --> 00:35:30.900
met each other and they're
going to try and see

00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:34.260
if they can become partners.

00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:35.782
OK-- that's enough for a play?

00:35:35.782 --> 00:35:37.240
That's enough for
a 90-minute play?

00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:38.510
Like, OK.

00:35:38.510 --> 00:35:42.190
But it's like every
few minutes there's

00:35:42.190 --> 00:35:46.322
little pockets of surprises
that come out and that excite us

00:35:46.322 --> 00:35:47.530
and that excite the audience.

00:35:47.530 --> 00:35:53.205
And it's very rich.

00:35:53.205 --> 00:35:55.080
And there's just so much
for us to play with,

00:35:55.080 --> 00:36:02.750
and I think the joy of it
is the overwhelming theme.

00:36:02.750 --> 00:36:05.800
I mean, I think,
Rosetta talks a lot

00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:15.510
and teaches Marie about how
the idea of praising God

00:36:15.510 --> 00:36:20.090
doesn't have to be like a job.

00:36:20.090 --> 00:36:27.460
It doesn't have to be rigid
and for the purpose of not

00:36:27.460 --> 00:36:28.490
going to hell.

00:36:28.490 --> 00:36:30.800
It actually should
be a positive thing.

00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:33.750
It should be all
about joy, and you can

00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:35.640
praise in many different ways.

00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:39.290
And I think that is
just so impactful.

00:36:39.290 --> 00:36:41.130
And it really I think
it like takes us

00:36:41.130 --> 00:36:43.134
all on a journey every day.

00:36:43.134 --> 00:36:46.900
NEIL PEPE: I just
want to add one--

00:36:46.900 --> 00:36:49.800
All of that-- and
another thing that I find

00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:52.550
fascinating about working on
it and working with these guys

00:36:52.550 --> 00:36:58.320
is one of the things-- to look
at these two women, who really

00:36:58.320 --> 00:36:59.370
they're heroes.

00:36:59.370 --> 00:37:00.770
They're unsung heroes.

00:37:00.770 --> 00:37:04.280
And the reason they're
heroes is far reaching.

00:37:04.280 --> 00:37:08.390
But when you look
at two black women

00:37:08.390 --> 00:37:11.940
at that time under
those circumstances,

00:37:11.940 --> 00:37:14.020
whether dealing with
racism or sexism

00:37:14.020 --> 00:37:18.530
or performing in the South or
men who were taking their money

00:37:18.530 --> 00:37:21.030
or whatever was
going on-- the fact

00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:26.590
that not only were they
doing this incredible music,

00:37:26.590 --> 00:37:29.310
but they were
bringing so much joy.

00:37:29.310 --> 00:37:31.300
You didn't see the adversity.

00:37:31.300 --> 00:37:32.490
You saw the strength.

00:37:32.490 --> 00:37:36.420
You saw the willingness to
embrace the truth and the joy.

00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:37.930
And that's part of
the thing that I

00:37:37.930 --> 00:37:41.070
find amazing about
watching these two do it.

00:37:41.070 --> 00:37:45.380
It's sort of about teaching
each other to have the strength

00:37:45.380 --> 00:37:47.260
to tell your own story.

00:37:47.260 --> 00:37:50.430
To have the strength to
be who you want to be.

00:37:50.430 --> 00:37:52.770
Not to sound too pat about it.

00:37:52.770 --> 00:37:55.190
But I think the
fact that they were

00:37:55.190 --> 00:37:57.780
able to do that under
those circumstances

00:37:57.780 --> 00:38:01.290
and still not-- granted
Rosetta was popular

00:38:01.290 --> 00:38:03.940
for a certain period
of her career,

00:38:03.940 --> 00:38:06.350
but then really sort of
forgotten since then.

00:38:06.350 --> 00:38:08.337
And yet they still did that.

00:38:08.337 --> 00:38:10.170
And still have the
strength to celebrate it.

00:38:10.170 --> 00:38:14.720
That was remarkable to me and
remarkable about who they were

00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:16.400
and why we want
to celebrate them.

00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:17.830
MAHLET SEYOUM: Absolutely.

00:38:17.830 --> 00:38:20.300
I want to open it up to
questions from the audience.

00:38:20.300 --> 00:38:23.140
We have two mics on either side,
so if you guys have a question,

00:38:23.140 --> 00:38:24.600
just go ahead and line up.

00:38:29.445 --> 00:38:32.620
AUDIENCE: I saw the play just
the day before yesterday.

00:38:32.620 --> 00:38:35.510
And I had no idea what it
would be like going in,

00:38:35.510 --> 00:38:40.140
but I was just so
happy that I did it.

00:38:40.140 --> 00:38:41.390
NEIL PEPE: Great.

00:38:41.390 --> 00:38:43.030
AUDIENCE: So one
question that I had

00:38:43.030 --> 00:38:45.310
was you mentioned
how you had never

00:38:45.310 --> 00:38:46.470
heard about Sister Rosetta.

00:38:46.470 --> 00:38:51.430
I hadn't and I'm sure your--
did your playwright George know

00:38:51.430 --> 00:38:52.330
about it before?

00:38:52.330 --> 00:38:53.970
NEIL PEPE: He knew
a little bit about--

00:38:53.970 --> 00:38:58.040
he didn't-- he had heard a song,
by actually a white artist,

00:38:58.040 --> 00:39:02.030
Robert Plant, and Alison Krauss
called "Sister Rosetta Comes

00:39:02.030 --> 00:39:02.530
Before Us."

00:39:02.530 --> 00:39:04.750
And then through his
interest in that song,

00:39:04.750 --> 00:39:07.780
researched her and then
ended up becoming obviously

00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:10.220
a massive fan and
learning all about her.

00:39:10.220 --> 00:39:14.270
AUDIENCE: So a lot of the themes
were in a very private setting,

00:39:14.270 --> 00:39:18.330
an interaction between Sister
Rosetta and Marie, right.

00:39:18.330 --> 00:39:21.400
I'm just wondering how you
got a lot of the material

00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:26.290
and research to write that
play given that they're not

00:39:26.290 --> 00:39:29.760
that well-known popularly.

00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:32.200
And, of course, you also
mentioned that a lot of it

00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:35.980
was you're just not trying
to represent them completely,

00:39:35.980 --> 00:39:38.250
but you're also trying
to bring yourself in.

00:39:38.250 --> 00:39:42.550
So what parts of it were
factual, and what parts of it

00:39:42.550 --> 00:39:44.720
were stuff that you brought in?

00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:47.220
NEIL PEPE: I'll try to speak
for George, because it's really

00:39:47.220 --> 00:39:49.470
a question mainly for him.

00:39:49.470 --> 00:39:52.700
George did a lot of research.

00:39:52.700 --> 00:39:55.820
There's a wonderful book
called "Shout, Sister, Shout!"

00:39:55.820 --> 00:39:58.260
which is a biography
of Sister Rosetta.

00:39:58.260 --> 00:39:59.540
He read that.

00:39:59.540 --> 00:40:01.660
He read a lot of other
books about gospel.

00:40:01.660 --> 00:40:06.060
He watched on YouTube a lot
of the footage of Rosetta.

00:40:06.060 --> 00:40:08.950
And there's a
wonderful documentary

00:40:08.950 --> 00:40:12.080
that was made on PBS, which is
also on YouTube in four or five

00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:13.500
different parts.

00:40:13.500 --> 00:40:15.520
So he did that.

00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:21.960
And to address your
question, I would say 95%

00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:24.990
or so, even more of
this play is factual.

00:40:24.990 --> 00:40:28.110
I mean the basic events
of what took place here

00:40:28.110 --> 00:40:30.850
and the things they
describe are real.

00:40:30.850 --> 00:40:33.440
The only thing that George
messed with a little bit

00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:37.800
time wise is Rosetta's
mother died later in her life

00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:39.755
than in the play,
but he felt like it

00:40:39.755 --> 00:40:43.160
would be more dramatically
interesting to put it recent.

00:40:43.160 --> 00:40:47.380
And so that they could--
that's why Marie ends up

00:40:47.380 --> 00:40:49.900
singing that song to
sort of comfort Rosetta

00:40:49.900 --> 00:40:50.700
during this time.

00:40:50.700 --> 00:40:53.650
But George really
immersed himself in it.

00:40:53.650 --> 00:40:55.630
But then going to
the point we made

00:40:55.630 --> 00:40:57.610
before, I think
at a certain point

00:40:57.610 --> 00:40:59.560
took all of the
factual information

00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:02.300
that he had, put it aside,
and then wrote a play,

00:41:02.300 --> 00:41:06.520
and wrote a story as great
playwrights can only do.

00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:08.600
So it wasn't just about
sticking to the facts,

00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:12.972
but how he crafts the facts
that he had into a story.

00:41:12.972 --> 00:41:14.430
How-- like we're
talking about-- he

00:41:14.430 --> 00:41:18.940
brings his truth and experience
to making that happen.

00:41:18.940 --> 00:41:23.090
And then not for nothing,
how to frame up these songs,

00:41:23.090 --> 00:41:25.310
because there's a
lot-- you'll find

00:41:25.310 --> 00:41:28.010
they did a lot of
amazing songs together,

00:41:28.010 --> 00:41:30.620
and George was only able
to use some of them.

00:41:30.620 --> 00:41:33.360
I even discovered-- if you
know that Rolling Stones

00:41:33.360 --> 00:41:36.580
album, "Sticky Fingers,"
there's a song,

00:41:36.580 --> 00:41:38.070
"You Gotta Move," on that.

00:41:38.070 --> 00:41:40.899
And it's a song
that these two did.

00:41:40.899 --> 00:41:42.440
And I think they
may have even wrote.

00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:43.860
Or it's a traditional.

00:41:43.860 --> 00:41:46.820
But the way the Stones
do it is exactly the way

00:41:46.820 --> 00:41:47.650
these two did it.

00:41:47.650 --> 00:41:49.580
And it's kind of
amazing-- you're going,

00:41:49.580 --> 00:41:53.480
oh my god, I've known that song
for 35 years or however long,

00:41:53.480 --> 00:41:56.460
and in fact, the first
time it was ever done

00:41:56.460 --> 00:42:00.300
was these two women, and they're
singing it with such strength,

00:42:00.300 --> 00:42:05.520
and, you know, rock
and roll spirit.

00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:07.310
So, yeah, George
did lots of research

00:42:07.310 --> 00:42:12.138
and then kind of did what
he wanted to do after that.

00:42:12.138 --> 00:42:13.540
MAHLET SEYOUM: Go ahead.

00:42:13.540 --> 00:42:14.750
AUDIENCE: This is
maybe a silly question,

00:42:14.750 --> 00:42:16.166
but I noticed on
the poster there,

00:42:16.166 --> 00:42:18.380
it says, "world premier
play with music,"

00:42:18.380 --> 00:42:19.810
rather than like a musical.

00:42:19.810 --> 00:42:24.070
Is there specific reason for
why it's worded like that?

00:42:24.070 --> 00:42:25.580
NEIL PEPE: That's
a good question.

00:42:25.580 --> 00:42:27.100
We kept going back and forth.

00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:29.710
And George originally
called it a play with music,

00:42:29.710 --> 00:42:33.120
because I think he thought
of it more as a play that

00:42:33.120 --> 00:42:36.640
had songs in it, and now he's
been sort of saying to me,

00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:39.560
oh, maybe I should have
called it a musical,

00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:42.400
because there is that thing
of-- if you saw "Once," I

00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:43.900
mean it's not that
different. "Once"

00:42:43.900 --> 00:42:46.570
had existing songs in it,
and they called it a musical.

00:42:46.570 --> 00:42:49.379
So I think it was just George.

00:42:49.379 --> 00:42:51.170
I think this is the
first musical he's ever

00:42:51.170 --> 00:42:55.320
written-- or play with
music-- so I think he thinks

00:42:55.320 --> 00:42:56.830
of himself as a playwright.

00:42:56.830 --> 00:42:58.570
But it's a very,
very good question.

00:42:58.570 --> 00:43:01.800
There wasn't a sort of formula
for that other than thinking

00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:05.640
it might be a play
first with songs.

00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:08.010
And I guess some
might say, if you're

00:43:08.010 --> 00:43:11.420
going to be purist about it--
which these guys know better

00:43:11.420 --> 00:43:14.970
than I-- in the classical
sense of the musical,

00:43:14.970 --> 00:43:18.700
you can have songs that are
really one character talking

00:43:18.700 --> 00:43:21.830
to another that are moving the
thing forward dramatically,

00:43:21.830 --> 00:43:25.390
and while these certainly
have a specific place,

00:43:25.390 --> 00:43:27.340
each song dramatically,
they're less--

00:43:27.340 --> 00:43:29.640
they're not built that way.

00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:30.182
You know?

00:43:30.182 --> 00:43:32.390
But, I guess, they called
"American Idiot" a musical,

00:43:32.390 --> 00:43:33.330
didn't they?

00:43:33.330 --> 00:43:34.900
REBECCA NAOMI JONES: They
called that a rock opera.

00:43:34.900 --> 00:43:35.566
NEIL PEPE: Yeah.

00:43:35.566 --> 00:43:36.080
Yeah.

00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:36.669
Yeah.

00:43:36.669 --> 00:43:37.210
There you go.

00:43:37.210 --> 00:43:38.959
KECIA LEWIS: Yeah,
this-- I mean everybody

00:43:38.959 --> 00:43:41.570
has their different ideas
of what a musical is.

00:43:41.570 --> 00:43:46.410
And I did what's considered the
first jukebox musical, which is

00:43:46.410 --> 00:43:47.980
"Ain't Misbehavin" on Broadway.

00:43:47.980 --> 00:43:52.530
It's very, very different,
because that structure

00:43:52.530 --> 00:43:56.220
of the jukebox musical is
that you have a bunch of songs

00:43:56.220 --> 00:43:59.450
and then you write a story to
make the songs work when you're

00:43:59.450 --> 00:44:02.060
doing them on stage for
people who have paid

00:44:02.060 --> 00:44:04.960
$167 for an orchestra seat.

00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:09.780
So this is definitely from
an actor's perspective,

00:44:09.780 --> 00:44:11.122
a play with music.

00:44:11.122 --> 00:44:12.830
REBECCA NAOMI JONES:
Yeah, I would agree.

00:44:12.830 --> 00:44:15.205
Even beyond it being
not a jukebox musical,

00:44:15.205 --> 00:44:16.830
I think it doesn't
feel like a musical,

00:44:16.830 --> 00:44:20.030
because the text is really
what forwards the story along.

00:44:20.030 --> 00:44:20.670
No question.

00:44:20.670 --> 00:44:25.740
I mean the songs absolutely
serve to aid in that,

00:44:25.740 --> 00:44:28.890
but the text-- I mean there's
so much text, first of all,

00:44:28.890 --> 00:44:32.010
and I think that's really
where the play comes alive

00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:35.400
and all of the
things are revealed.

00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:40.360
And, yeah, I think
that the amount of text

00:44:40.360 --> 00:44:41.374
is what makes it.

00:44:41.374 --> 00:44:43.290
Also I just remembered,
like "American Idiot,"

00:44:43.290 --> 00:44:45.456
we didn't have text, that's
why it was a rock opera.

00:44:45.456 --> 00:44:48.709
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:48.709 --> 00:44:49.750
MAHLET SEYOUM: Thank you.

00:44:49.750 --> 00:44:51.000
You can go ahead.

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:52.380
AUDIENCE: Thanks
for coming today

00:44:52.380 --> 00:44:55.050
and for performing for us.

00:44:55.050 --> 00:44:57.300
I'm going to try to ask this
without spoiling anything

00:44:57.300 --> 00:45:00.340
for folks who haven't
seen the play with music,

00:45:00.340 --> 00:45:03.990
but there's a moment towards
the end in which it's

00:45:03.990 --> 00:45:07.690
revealed that Felicia and
Deah are the musicians,

00:45:07.690 --> 00:45:11.200
and I think that it was an
incredibly powerful moment

00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:14.100
for me, especially
considering the musicianship

00:45:14.100 --> 00:45:15.540
is just so incredible
in the show

00:45:15.540 --> 00:45:18.270
and the performances overall.

00:45:18.270 --> 00:45:19.890
So just a really
focused question

00:45:19.890 --> 00:45:23.910
around what types of
conversations were had

00:45:23.910 --> 00:45:28.361
or anything discussed around
like how Deah and Felicia

00:45:28.361 --> 00:45:31.360
were going to be
kind of showcased

00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:34.350
as part of this performance?

00:45:34.350 --> 00:45:37.030
NEIL PEPE: It's an
interesting question.

00:45:37.030 --> 00:45:39.880
Because ostensibly we
were trying to figure out,

00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:44.200
because it's a play about
two amazing women who are--

00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:46.560
and we needed amazing
actors, amazing singers,

00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:50.110
and both of these women
were incredible musicians.

00:45:50.110 --> 00:45:55.820
And so George and I decided
we'll take two of the three.

00:45:55.820 --> 00:45:59.950
And so we knew early on that
we wanted to have musicians,

00:45:59.950 --> 00:46:01.460
but like you say
the question was,

00:46:01.460 --> 00:46:02.960
how to integrate
those musicians.

00:46:02.960 --> 00:46:07.760
And we knew we didn't want
to trick the audience.

00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:09.910
We didn't want to apologize
for having musicians.

00:46:09.910 --> 00:46:12.450
But what we played
with early on in tech

00:46:12.450 --> 00:46:15.890
was whether we were going
to see them the whole time.

00:46:15.890 --> 00:46:21.934
And we found partly because the
miming was working well enough

00:46:21.934 --> 00:46:23.350
between the piano
and the guitar--

00:46:23.350 --> 00:46:26.690
it seemed to be working--
that we wanted to hold it back

00:46:26.690 --> 00:46:28.160
for a long time.

00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:29.990
And it, like you
say, dramatically, I

00:46:29.990 --> 00:46:32.470
think it ended up
working, because not only

00:46:32.470 --> 00:46:35.140
once you sort of are
allowed to see them,

00:46:35.140 --> 00:46:37.320
it becomes this kind
of revelation moment.

00:46:37.320 --> 00:46:39.290
And then not for
nothing a lot of people

00:46:39.290 --> 00:46:43.590
have said, oh my god, I just
inherently for whatever reason,

00:46:43.590 --> 00:46:45.500
they thought it would be men.

00:46:45.500 --> 00:46:47.300
And the fact that
all of a sudden it's

00:46:47.300 --> 00:46:50.690
two women, two extraordinary
women up there playing

00:46:50.690 --> 00:46:53.380
just becomes a whole
other thing that I think

00:46:53.380 --> 00:46:56.290
is unifying the piece.

00:46:56.290 --> 00:46:59.010
And that was an important
thing for us to do that.

00:46:59.010 --> 00:47:02.350
And we were lucky to have
the musicians that we have.

00:47:02.350 --> 00:47:04.350
So we did think a lot
about that and try

00:47:04.350 --> 00:47:06.580
to figure out how
to integrate it

00:47:06.580 --> 00:47:09.234
and I kind of like
where we ended up.

00:47:09.234 --> 00:47:11.650
But of course we'd always like
to show the musicians more.

00:47:11.650 --> 00:47:14.005
But we hear them, and
we're psyched about that.

00:47:17.510 --> 00:47:18.230
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:47:18.230 --> 00:47:20.500
First I want to say that
the play was incredible.

00:47:20.500 --> 00:47:22.650
I loved it.

00:47:22.650 --> 00:47:27.330
So in the play, there is at one
point Rosetta says to Marie,

00:47:27.330 --> 00:47:29.430
I want you to be an "and."

00:47:29.430 --> 00:47:31.240
I want us to be
Rosetta and Marie.

00:47:31.240 --> 00:47:33.080
And I noticed that
the play is actually

00:47:33.080 --> 00:47:34.860
named Marie and
Rosetta, and I was

00:47:34.860 --> 00:47:37.890
wondering if there was some
kind of significance there.

00:47:37.890 --> 00:47:40.890
MAHLET SEYOUM: I had a
question about that, too.

00:47:40.890 --> 00:47:43.310
NEIL PEPE: I'll let Kecia
talk about that a little bit.

00:47:43.310 --> 00:47:45.775
I think there's
something about--

00:47:45.775 --> 00:47:47.622
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:47.622 --> 00:47:49.080
Do would you want
to talk about it?

00:47:49.080 --> 00:47:49.872
KECIA LEWIS: No.

00:47:49.872 --> 00:47:50.676
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:50.676 --> 00:47:52.300
NEIL PEPE: The only
reason is because I

00:47:52.300 --> 00:47:54.300
feel like it became a
big deal, which is one

00:47:54.300 --> 00:47:56.890
of the things about this story.

00:47:56.890 --> 00:48:00.440
The question is why
did Rosetta-- you know,

00:48:00.440 --> 00:48:02.590
Rosetta was a big
star at this point.

00:48:02.590 --> 00:48:05.810
Why did she all of a sudden
at this point in her career

00:48:05.810 --> 00:48:11.274
pick a very young girl
out of this gospel quartet

00:48:11.274 --> 00:48:13.440
or whatever Marie was doing--
what were they called?

00:48:13.440 --> 00:48:14.380
The gospel--

00:48:14.380 --> 00:48:16.342
REBECCA NAOMI JONES:
The Sunset Four.

00:48:16.342 --> 00:48:18.800
NEIL PEPE: She was playing in
New Jersey with a band called

00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:20.383
the Sunset Four and
singing with them.

00:48:20.383 --> 00:48:23.400
And Rosetta went, I want you.

00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:25.627
And not only did
she say, I want you.

00:48:25.627 --> 00:48:28.210
She didn't say-- and she makes
a big deal of this in the play.

00:48:28.210 --> 00:48:30.020
She's like, I'm not going
to put you back there.

00:48:30.020 --> 00:48:31.353
I'm going to put you next to me.

00:48:31.353 --> 00:48:34.660
I think it got to
the essence of to me

00:48:34.660 --> 00:48:39.160
what the play was about, which
was about why you might need

00:48:39.160 --> 00:48:42.420
another person,
not only musically,

00:48:42.420 --> 00:48:46.970
but-- Marie says in
a late interview.

00:48:46.970 --> 00:48:49.400
She said Rosetta
said she was lonely.

00:48:49.400 --> 00:48:51.120
And so there's something
about this play,

00:48:51.120 --> 00:48:54.320
about dealing with
loneliness, companionship,

00:48:54.320 --> 00:48:56.150
and wanting somebody equal.

00:48:56.150 --> 00:48:58.150
One of the things Kecia
and I talked about a lot

00:48:58.150 --> 00:49:02.040
is what's the test that Rosetta
is putting Marie through

00:49:02.040 --> 00:49:04.050
is part of can I trust you?

00:49:04.050 --> 00:49:05.790
Are you somebody who
can tell the truth?

00:49:05.790 --> 00:49:07.960
Because I want somebody equal.

00:49:07.960 --> 00:49:10.170
And I think Rosanna
needed that, right?

00:49:10.170 --> 00:49:11.590
I think she wanted a companion.

00:49:11.590 --> 00:49:12.430
KECIA LEWIS: Yeah.

00:49:12.430 --> 00:49:15.730
In my research of Rosetta,
I kept seeing over and over

00:49:15.730 --> 00:49:19.880
again that throughout her career
she was looking for partners.

00:49:19.880 --> 00:49:23.380
She had-- for whatever
reason, and we don't know,

00:49:23.380 --> 00:49:27.070
she just did not want
to perform alone.

00:49:27.070 --> 00:49:30.370
And so she was always
looking for someone

00:49:30.370 --> 00:49:36.200
who was her musical equal and
who she could partner with.

00:49:36.200 --> 00:49:40.120
She was very adamant
and said it often

00:49:40.120 --> 00:49:43.550
that she did not want to
be considered a great woman

00:49:43.550 --> 00:49:44.720
guitarist.

00:49:44.720 --> 00:49:47.740
She wanted to be considered
a great guitarist.

00:49:47.740 --> 00:49:50.560
And so everybody
that she asked to be

00:49:50.560 --> 00:49:53.610
a part of her life in the
different phases of her career,

00:49:53.610 --> 00:49:56.860
musically, they were all great
artists in their own right,

00:49:56.860 --> 00:49:58.600
because that's what she wanted.

00:49:58.600 --> 00:50:01.641
And, yeah, now, I was
like, me answer it?

00:50:01.641 --> 00:50:02.140
What?

00:50:02.140 --> 00:50:05.240
But yeah, that was the
research that I found.

00:50:05.240 --> 00:50:06.190
She always wanted it.

00:50:06.190 --> 00:50:09.450
And just in terms of
Marie and Rosetta.

00:50:09.450 --> 00:50:13.170
I think that George-- if I
remember correctly, he said,

00:50:13.170 --> 00:50:16.270
the play is told from
Marie's perspective.

00:50:16.270 --> 00:50:20.370
So in real life they were
the duo, Rosetta and Marie,

00:50:20.370 --> 00:50:23.850
but in this reality this
is Marie and Rosetta.

00:50:26.857 --> 00:50:28.440
MAHLET SEYOUM: Thank
you guys so much.

00:50:28.440 --> 00:50:29.900
We're at time.

00:50:29.900 --> 00:50:32.900
Thank you for the performances
and this incredible talk back.

00:50:32.900 --> 00:50:34.480
This show is still running.

00:50:34.480 --> 00:50:37.140
Do you want to before everyone
leaves just talk about how they

00:50:37.140 --> 00:50:38.680
can come see the show and
how they can learn more

00:50:38.680 --> 00:50:39.750
about the theater?

00:50:39.750 --> 00:50:42.100
NEIL PEPE: So it runs
until October 16th.

00:50:42.100 --> 00:50:44.410
And it's at the Atlantic
Theater Company on 20th Street

00:50:44.410 --> 00:50:45.340
between 8th and 9th.

00:50:45.340 --> 00:50:47.980
You can go to our website,
atlantictheater.org.

00:50:47.980 --> 00:50:49.460
It's going really well.

00:50:49.460 --> 00:50:50.710
It's gotten terrific reviews.

00:50:50.710 --> 00:50:52.100
And audiences are loving it.

00:50:52.100 --> 00:50:54.160
We thank those of you
that have come to see it.

00:50:54.160 --> 00:50:56.820
These guys are amazing, so
don't miss the opportunity

00:50:56.820 --> 00:50:59.770
to see these four extraordinary
performers up there.

00:50:59.770 --> 00:51:03.070
And we, as Atlantic,
are grateful to be

00:51:03.070 --> 00:51:04.490
in the same building
with Google.

00:51:04.490 --> 00:51:07.920
We want to bring all you tech
guys over to the theater world.

00:51:07.920 --> 00:51:10.740
And so we would love to
turn you on to what we do,

00:51:10.740 --> 00:51:13.435
and we're loving being
turned on to what this

00:51:13.435 --> 00:51:14.850
is, which is kind of amazing.

00:51:14.850 --> 00:51:16.840
So thanks for having us.

00:51:16.840 --> 00:51:18.870
Yeah, thanks for bringing
us your fancy digs.

00:51:18.870 --> 00:51:21.510
And come see us.

00:51:21.510 --> 00:51:24.260
We would love to have you,
and we're honored to be here.

00:51:24.260 --> 00:51:25.090
MAHLET SEYOUM:
Thank you so much.

00:51:25.090 --> 00:51:26.340
And thank you guys for coming.

00:51:26.340 --> 00:51:27.860
[APPLAUSE]
