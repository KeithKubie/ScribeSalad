00:00:00.248 --> 00:00:02.042
- [Mark] We ordered a
bunch of seafood dishes.

00:00:02.042 --> 00:00:04.853
Potaek is another fantastic Thai soup.

00:00:04.853 --> 00:00:07.522
It should be quite sour but
what I love about potaek

00:00:07.522 --> 00:00:09.209
is that it's such a pure taste.

00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:11.792
(upbeat music)

00:00:18.488 --> 00:00:20.599
Taking a trip today to Samut Prakan.

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:23.021
You're looking rather fresh this morning.

00:00:23.021 --> 00:00:24.939
- [Ying] Really?

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:26.159
Reary?

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:26.992
Reary?

00:00:26.992 --> 00:00:27.825
(speaking foreign language)

00:00:27.825 --> 00:00:28.868
Reary?

00:00:28.868 --> 00:00:30.022
- Good morning, everyone.

00:00:30.022 --> 00:00:32.155
It's Mark Wiens with migrationology.com

00:00:32.155 --> 00:00:33.973
in Bangkok, Thailand.

00:00:33.973 --> 00:00:36.360
Bangkok is located about 20 kilometers

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.986
north of the ocean, the sea,

00:00:38.986 --> 00:00:41.664
which is actually the Gulf of Thailand.

00:00:41.664 --> 00:00:45.614
So today we're taking
a little drive to the,

00:00:45.614 --> 00:00:48.781
I think it will be the closest sea in,

00:00:50.045 --> 00:00:51.228
closest sea to Bangkok

00:00:51.228 --> 00:00:54.353
which is in a different
province called Samut Prakan.

00:00:54.353 --> 00:00:58.001
It's about a 20 or so kilometer
drive, not too far away.

00:00:58.001 --> 00:00:59.175
We're gonna see the sea.

00:00:59.175 --> 00:01:00.698
We're gonna hopefully eat some seafood

00:01:00.698 --> 00:01:03.527
and we might stop off at the
Samut Prakan Market first.

00:01:03.527 --> 00:01:05.305
In order to drive to Samut Prakan

00:01:05.305 --> 00:01:07.235
it's actually really easy
to get there from Bangkok.

00:01:07.235 --> 00:01:10.476
Just a straight shot down Sukhumvit Road.

00:01:10.476 --> 00:01:13.059
(upbeat music)

00:01:29.211 --> 00:01:30.959
We just arrived to Samut Prakan

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:33.133
right in the center of the town.

00:01:33.133 --> 00:01:34.412
And what I love about Samut Prakan

00:01:34.412 --> 00:01:37.254
is that we never left
the city to get here,

00:01:37.254 --> 00:01:39.047
although we're in a different province.

00:01:39.047 --> 00:01:40.047
But at the same time,

00:01:40.047 --> 00:01:44.418
Samut Prakan has such a
pleasant smaller feel to it.

00:01:44.418 --> 00:01:47.746
It has that small town feel
to it as opposed to Bangkok.

00:01:47.746 --> 00:01:49.447
We're just walking over to the market.

00:01:49.447 --> 00:01:51.067
We're just gonna spend a few minutes

00:01:51.067 --> 00:01:53.681
walking around the market,
the seafood market,

00:01:53.681 --> 00:01:56.816
just 'cause we're on our
way this direction anyways

00:01:56.816 --> 00:01:58.596
and it's a fantastic seafood market.

00:01:58.596 --> 00:02:01.179
(upbeat music)

00:02:10.387 --> 00:02:12.083
Have you ever seen this before?

00:02:12.083 --> 00:02:13.353
Horseshoe crabs.

00:02:13.353 --> 00:02:17.744
(speaking foreign language)

00:02:17.744 --> 00:02:20.750
Lots and lots of awesome
seafood at this market.

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.118
From fish, lots of platu
which are mackerel.

00:02:24.118 --> 00:02:27.113
And then lots of crab and horseshoe crab.

00:02:27.113 --> 00:02:30.685
There are little shells and
then there are lots of shrimp

00:02:30.685 --> 00:02:34.937
and there are even some
types of rays over there

00:02:34.937 --> 00:02:37.220
as well as mantis prawns.

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:38.053
- Hello!
- Hello!

00:02:38.053 --> 00:02:39.086
- Hello!
- Hello!

00:02:39.086 --> 00:02:42.753
(speaking foreign language)

00:02:53.447 --> 00:02:55.947
They've got some giant octopus

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.684
and a variety of different squid.

00:02:59.684 --> 00:03:03.146
She said they're really fresh and good.

00:03:03.146 --> 00:03:06.005
- I don't really know which is which.

00:03:06.005 --> 00:03:09.672
(speaking foreign language)

00:03:14.456 --> 00:03:16.353
- This is always such a friendly market

00:03:16.353 --> 00:03:18.201
to walk around and explore.

00:03:18.201 --> 00:03:21.868
Many friendly vendors
and so much good food.

00:03:24.872 --> 00:03:27.455
(upbeat music)

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:35.123
Oh you know what's really good?

00:03:35.123 --> 00:03:39.771
This one with ginger, mom,
ginger and green apple.

00:03:39.771 --> 00:03:41.721
I'll probably get mixed fruit for Ying.

00:03:41.721 --> 00:03:43.886
- [Mark's sister] What would
that be, like everything?

00:03:43.886 --> 00:03:45.710
- Yeah, whatever she decides.
- I would probably have more--

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:46.793
- Just outside of the market

00:03:46.793 --> 00:03:48.978
we have stopped by at a juice stall.

00:03:48.978 --> 00:03:51.885
She has a bunch of fruit
and she's juicing them.

00:03:51.885 --> 00:03:54.942
And I ordered a couple
of mixed fruit juices

00:03:54.942 --> 00:03:56.489
which she's adding in like pineapple

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:58.806
and a variety of different fruits.

00:03:58.806 --> 00:04:01.507
But then I wanted to try
an interesting combination

00:04:01.507 --> 00:04:05.037
with bitter melon, and also
krachai, which is finger root

00:04:05.037 --> 00:04:06.905
which has a similar taste to ginger

00:04:06.905 --> 00:04:09.745
as well as I think green apple.

00:04:09.745 --> 00:04:13.912
Oh and she's filling in
the mixed fruit right now.

00:04:15.648 --> 00:04:18.619
But we'll see how the
bitter melon one tastes.

00:04:18.619 --> 00:04:21.293
This one is the mixed fruit
that I got for my sister

00:04:21.293 --> 00:04:23.793
and she says it's really good.

00:04:25.678 --> 00:04:26.511
Oh yeah.

00:04:28.578 --> 00:04:30.381
It is delicious.

00:04:30.381 --> 00:04:33.826
It's perfectly sour and sweet and so fresh

00:04:33.826 --> 00:04:35.460
It's perfectly sour
and sweet and so fresh.

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.034
And I think she added in
some beetroot as well.

00:04:37.034 --> 00:04:38.608
That's what made it so red.

00:04:38.608 --> 00:04:42.698
For my juice, she added in a
couple handfuls of bitter melon

00:04:42.698 --> 00:04:45.352
and a whole handful of the finger root

00:04:45.352 --> 00:04:47.685
and then I think just apple.

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:56.159
Wow, that is intensely bitter and awesome.

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:58.973
Wow, that is intensely bitter and awesome.

00:04:58.973 --> 00:05:01.294
Oh, bitter but smooth.

00:05:01.294 --> 00:05:04.004
And then it's countered
by the gingery taste

00:05:04.004 --> 00:05:05.701
of the finger root

00:05:05.701 --> 00:05:08.534
and then very sour from the apple.

00:05:12.792 --> 00:05:16.459
(speaking foreign language)

00:05:20.878 --> 00:05:23.150
And I like how it's squeezed so fresh

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:24.925
so there's still foam on top.

00:05:24.925 --> 00:05:28.714
It's almost like a, a bitter
melon fruit cappuccino.

00:05:28.714 --> 00:05:31.297
(upbeat music)

00:05:36.266 --> 00:05:38.393
Ying was at first feeding Micah in the car

00:05:38.393 --> 00:05:40.693
so that's when we went to
go walk around the market

00:05:40.693 --> 00:05:42.652
but then she came out.

00:05:42.652 --> 00:05:43.787
Hello, Micah.

00:05:43.787 --> 00:05:44.679
- [Ying] Hello!

00:05:44.679 --> 00:05:45.921
- [Mark] Hello, Micah.

00:05:45.921 --> 00:05:47.575
And then she went to buy some,

00:05:47.575 --> 00:05:48.894
what did you buy, Ying?

00:05:48.894 --> 00:05:51.034
- [Ying] Chips, durian chips.

00:05:51.034 --> 00:05:54.197
- She bought, oh durian
chips, my favorite!

00:05:54.197 --> 00:05:57.513
Okay, I gotta grab some of
these durian chips immediately.

00:05:57.513 --> 00:05:58.740
And by the way, thank you, Ying

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:01.240
for buying these durian chips.

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:06.490
And so these are just
very thin slices of durian

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:09.920
which are deep fried just
like potato chips but durian.

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:12.835
And normally they use a
durian that's pretty unripe

00:06:12.835 --> 00:06:15.388
so it has more of a firmer texture

00:06:15.388 --> 00:06:18.138
rather than that pudding texture.

00:06:24.616 --> 00:06:25.725
This is like the,

00:06:25.725 --> 00:06:27.843
the top of all chips.

00:06:27.843 --> 00:06:32.742
And I'm gonna wash that down
with some bitter melon juice.

00:06:32.742 --> 00:06:33.575
Oh!

00:06:33.575 --> 00:06:34.408
Oh!

00:06:34.408 --> 00:06:36.076
This is awesome.

00:06:36.076 --> 00:06:40.178
Durian chips and bitter melon
juice, what a combination!

00:06:40.178 --> 00:06:43.235
From here we are driving
towards a place called Bangpoo.

00:06:43.235 --> 00:06:45.818
(upbeat music)

00:06:56.132 --> 00:06:57.850
It was just about a 10 minute drive

00:06:57.850 --> 00:06:59.909
from the center of Samut Prakan.

00:06:59.909 --> 00:07:02.208
And this place is called Bangpoo.

00:07:02.208 --> 00:07:05.637
And it's a navy, Thai navy compound

00:07:05.637 --> 00:07:09.222
and then they have a pier
that goes out into the ocean.

00:07:09.222 --> 00:07:10.782
And this is not really a beach,

00:07:10.782 --> 00:07:11.922
it's not a swimming beach.

00:07:11.922 --> 00:07:15.060
It's more of a looking beach
and just a hanging out beach

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:17.506
and they have a seafood
restaurant here as well.

00:07:17.506 --> 00:07:20.115
And there's also, it's also
famous for its seagulls.

00:07:20.115 --> 00:07:23.114
And walking in here you can
already see the mangrove forest.

00:07:23.114 --> 00:07:25.299
And it's actually a whole road pier.

00:07:25.299 --> 00:07:27.714
You can, I think you
can get a golf cart ride

00:07:27.714 --> 00:07:29.336
to the end of the pier

00:07:29.336 --> 00:07:32.039
but I can see lots and lots
of seagulls in the distance

00:07:32.039 --> 00:07:35.062
and you can hear the waves crashing.

00:07:35.062 --> 00:07:36.863
It's actually quite nice.

00:07:36.863 --> 00:07:40.196
(waves crashing)

00:07:40.196 --> 00:07:41.029
It's cool.

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:44.463
(upbeat music)

00:07:48.274 --> 00:07:52.473
We are about to walk through
the valley of the seagulls.

00:07:52.473 --> 00:07:53.896
Luckily I have covered Micah's head

00:07:53.896 --> 00:07:58.063
so that he doesn't get any
bird crap on top of his head.

00:07:58.937 --> 00:08:02.020
(seagulls calling)

00:08:07.471 --> 00:08:11.972
Some people buy plates of,
maybe it's bread or bird feed

00:08:11.972 --> 00:08:13.044
to feed the seagulls.

00:08:13.044 --> 00:08:15.691
So that's why so many seagulls come.

00:08:15.691 --> 00:08:17.140
But they're actually really amazing

00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:19.247
to watch and just observe.

00:08:19.247 --> 00:08:21.997
They're so graceful how they fly.

00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:26.180
And then all the way
at the end of the pier

00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:29.390
is a restaurant called Sala Sukjai.

00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:31.989
And it's a seafood restaurant

00:08:31.989 --> 00:08:36.445
and we are going inside now
to eat seafood for lunch.

00:08:36.445 --> 00:08:40.112
(speaking foreign language)

00:08:46.941 --> 00:08:48.253
We walked into the restaurant

00:08:48.253 --> 00:08:50.045
and I love the feel of this restaurant.

00:08:50.045 --> 00:08:53.857
It has a kind of traditional,
like 70s feel to it.

00:08:53.857 --> 00:08:56.575
You walk out to the end of the pier here

00:08:56.575 --> 00:08:58.072
and then they have a whole restaurant.

00:08:58.072 --> 00:09:00.936
Even inside they have almost
what looks like a ballroom

00:09:00.936 --> 00:09:03.747
where you could have
a wedding or an event.

00:09:03.747 --> 00:09:07.267
And then on the outside to the
left, the left or right wing

00:09:07.267 --> 00:09:08.756
you can choose either one

00:09:08.756 --> 00:09:09.965
and come out here and they have an outdoor

00:09:09.965 --> 00:09:13.427
open air dining section with
a great view of the water

00:09:13.427 --> 00:09:16.580
and the seagulls, the sea breeze.

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:19.463
And we just ordered some seafood.

00:09:19.463 --> 00:09:23.130
(speaking foreign language)

00:09:25.399 --> 00:09:26.232
- [Mark's sister] So
that's the thing right

00:09:26.232 --> 00:09:27.240
when you make the stock?

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:29.033
- We ordered a bunch of seafood dishes

00:09:29.033 --> 00:09:30.891
and they have all arrived.

00:09:30.891 --> 00:09:33.379
I wanted to order crab
but the waitress said

00:09:33.379 --> 00:09:35.313
that they already ran out of crab.

00:09:35.313 --> 00:09:37.988
So we came a little bit
after the main lunch rush

00:09:37.988 --> 00:09:40.470
so I guess they sold
out of all their crab.

00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:44.022
But that's okay we got plenty
of awesome looking seafood.

00:09:44.022 --> 00:09:46.579
I'll just start explaining
what we're eating

00:09:46.579 --> 00:09:47.706
from this dish right here

00:09:47.706 --> 00:09:50.881
and then just kinda go around clockwise.

00:09:50.881 --> 00:09:55.525
This is phak kood which is
a type of fern, stir fried

00:09:55.525 --> 00:09:57.222
and then we also got goong ob woon sen

00:09:57.222 --> 00:10:00.373
which is mung bean noodles and shrimp in a

00:10:00.373 --> 00:10:02.398
kind of baked in this pot

00:10:02.398 --> 00:10:04.850
but with a stove, not in an oven.

00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:06.917
but with a stove, not in an oven.

00:10:06.917 --> 00:10:09.876
And then we've also got hoi malang poo

00:10:09.876 --> 00:10:11.428
And then we've also got hoi malang poo

00:10:11.428 --> 00:10:12.261
which are mussels which are
also kinda baked in this pot

00:10:12.261 --> 00:10:15.812
which are mussels which are
also kinda baked in this pot

00:10:15.812 --> 00:10:17.481
along with some basil.

00:10:17.481 --> 00:10:19.800
And then that's seafood
sauce there on the side.

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:21.904
And then we got tod man pla

00:10:21.904 --> 00:10:24.019
which are little fried fishcakes.

00:10:24.019 --> 00:10:28.605
There's also some fried basil
on top, I believe, as well.

00:10:28.605 --> 00:10:30.898
And for soup we got potaek thale,

00:10:30.898 --> 00:10:34.028
which potaek is another
fantastic Thai soup.

00:10:34.028 --> 00:10:36.846
It should be quite sour but
what I love about potaek

00:10:36.846 --> 00:10:38.509
is that it's such a pure taste.

00:10:38.509 --> 00:10:41.208
I think a seafood stock
and then seafood in there

00:10:41.208 --> 00:10:43.429
but then it's just sour with lime juice

00:10:43.429 --> 00:10:46.413
and then just a really
pure delicious taste.

00:10:46.413 --> 00:10:48.253
And then finally over
here is a fried fish.

00:10:48.253 --> 00:10:50.631
This is pla kapong tod nam pla.

00:10:50.631 --> 00:10:52.694
Which is a, it's a barramundi fish

00:10:52.694 --> 00:10:55.397
marinated in some fish
sauce and deep fried

00:10:55.397 --> 00:10:58.045
with that wonderful looking sauce there.

00:10:58.045 --> 00:10:59.774
Check out that sauce.

00:10:59.774 --> 00:11:00.795
- [Ying] Potaek.

00:11:00.795 --> 00:11:02.365
- [Mark] Let me start with that potaek.

00:11:02.365 --> 00:11:05.841
There's fish in here, there's
shrimp, there are mushrooms.

00:11:05.841 --> 00:11:08.166
- She's enjoying the fish.
- Put some of this in my bowl

00:11:08.166 --> 00:11:11.833
and I'm gonna get some
of that fish as well.

00:11:14.848 --> 00:11:16.848
And a lot of that broth.

00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:21.560
Just taste some of that broth.

00:11:27.424 --> 00:11:29.433
Oh that soup is amazing.

00:11:29.433 --> 00:11:31.014
Oh that soup is amazing.

00:11:31.014 --> 00:11:34.682
Oh it's so sour and then perfectly salty

00:11:34.682 --> 00:11:36.765
and yeah it just tastes so pure.

00:11:36.765 --> 00:11:38.880
I think it's a fish stock broth

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:40.910
and then all that seafood in there.

00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:43.372
You can really taste
the cilantro in there.

00:11:43.372 --> 00:11:45.313
You can taste the chilies in there,

00:11:45.313 --> 00:11:46.784
although it's not spicy.

00:11:46.784 --> 00:11:49.712
But it has a fresh chili flavor to it.

00:11:49.712 --> 00:11:51.920
Oh that's such a soothing broth.

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:53.936
You can have the shrimp
with mung beans, mom.

00:11:53.936 --> 00:11:55.406
- [Ying's mom] Ya.

00:11:55.406 --> 00:11:59.162
- Okay, I'm gonna move on
to the fried fish here.

00:11:59.162 --> 00:12:00.972
Try some of this fried fish.

00:12:00.972 --> 00:12:02.828
Break off this piece here.

00:12:02.828 --> 00:12:04.995
Break off this piece here.

00:12:07.762 --> 00:12:10.700
And then that sauce in
particular looks awesome.

00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:11.689
Looks like there's some,

00:12:11.689 --> 00:12:13.819
there might be some green mango down here.

00:12:13.819 --> 00:12:16.160
It looks like shredded
green mango with chilies.

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:17.592
Put that on, right on to
the fish and eat with rice.

00:12:17.592 --> 00:12:21.759
Put that on, right on to
the fish and eat with rice.

00:12:26.693 --> 00:12:27.526
Oh yeah.

00:12:27.526 --> 00:12:28.359
Oh yeah.

00:12:31.501 --> 00:12:33.689
The fish is so crispy.

00:12:33.689 --> 00:12:38.459
Kind of a sweet and sour
green mango chili sauce.

00:12:38.459 --> 00:12:40.779
And then next up, for
the goong ob woon sen.

00:12:40.779 --> 00:12:42.828
And there, they often flavor this,

00:12:42.828 --> 00:12:43.661
you can see on the bottom,

00:12:43.661 --> 00:12:44.967
there's some ginger, there's garlic,

00:12:44.967 --> 00:12:46.893
and then also the rak phak chi

00:12:46.893 --> 00:12:48.255
and then also the rak phak chi

00:12:48.255 --> 00:12:50.505
which is the cilantro roots

00:12:51.437 --> 00:12:53.956
which give it some flavor.

00:12:53.956 --> 00:12:55.714
And then sometimes they also add some

00:12:55.714 --> 00:12:57.703
a little bit of pork lard
down at the bottom there

00:12:57.703 --> 00:13:01.543
to give it some, a boost of deliciousness.

00:13:01.543 --> 00:13:05.126
But just those noodles
are really fragrant.

00:13:09.722 --> 00:13:10.555
Oh yeah.

00:13:10.555 --> 00:13:12.017
Oh yeah.

00:13:12.017 --> 00:13:15.143
I can really taste the ginger in there.

00:13:15.143 --> 00:13:16.226
Or maybe that's 'cause

00:13:16.226 --> 00:13:19.044
I got a whole piece of
ginger in that bite.

00:13:19.044 --> 00:13:20.961
But that is really good

00:13:22.242 --> 00:13:23.952
and the way they've made it here,

00:13:23.952 --> 00:13:26.447
the mung bean noodles are not
soggy like they sometimes get.

00:13:26.447 --> 00:13:28.614
And then also the mussels.

00:13:29.782 --> 00:13:32.895
Yeah, there's water at the
bottom here so it is steamed.

00:13:32.895 --> 00:13:37.243
There's lemongrass also and
there's also basil, sweet basil.

00:13:37.243 --> 00:13:41.799
Let me get a little leaf
of basil with a mussel

00:13:41.799 --> 00:13:44.632
and dip it into the seafood sauce.

00:13:48.498 --> 00:13:50.985
The mussels just have a slight aroma

00:13:50.985 --> 00:13:53.561
of the lemongrass and sweet basil

00:13:53.561 --> 00:13:57.478
and then dipped into that
chili garlicky sauce.

00:13:59.028 --> 00:14:02.022
Oh but you can, yeah, you can
taste that sweet basil nicely.

00:14:02.022 --> 00:14:05.260
I'm going in for the tod man pla.

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:09.177
And then that's all basil
fried on top as well.

00:14:11.616 --> 00:14:12.556
Check out the insides of that.

00:14:12.556 --> 00:14:14.295
You can see some chili

00:14:14.295 --> 00:14:15.306
You can see some chili

00:14:15.306 --> 00:14:19.306
and then also some slices
of long bean in there.

00:14:26.857 --> 00:14:28.711
Sometimes it can have
a really really smooth

00:14:28.711 --> 00:14:31.507
almost hot dog texture to it.

00:14:31.507 --> 00:14:34.484
But this has more of a,
like a ground fish flavor,

00:14:34.484 --> 00:14:37.484
texture to it, which is really good.

00:14:39.695 --> 00:14:41.074
It's almost like a fish scrambled egg

00:14:41.074 --> 00:14:43.907
but deep-fried into a patty shape.

00:14:45.130 --> 00:14:47.673
And then finally for the fried vegetable

00:14:47.673 --> 00:14:51.256
which is phak kood
which is a type of fern.

00:14:56.833 --> 00:14:59.222
It's always one of my favorite vegetables.

00:14:59.222 --> 00:15:01.977
It's crisp and then they've
just stir-fried this

00:15:01.977 --> 00:15:03.383
maybe in a little bit of oyster sauce

00:15:03.383 --> 00:15:06.466
and a little bit of fish sauce maybe.

00:15:12.322 --> 00:15:14.157
We just finished with lunch.

00:15:14.157 --> 00:15:16.324
That was a fantastic seafood meal.

00:15:16.324 --> 00:15:19.577
I think probably my favorite
dish was actually that soup,

00:15:19.577 --> 00:15:21.411
that potaek thale.

00:15:21.411 --> 00:15:23.706
If you come to this restaurant
don't miss that potaek.

00:15:23.706 --> 00:15:26.727
It was so sour and so flavorful.

00:15:26.727 --> 00:15:27.560
Really really good.

00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:29.889
And then just this atmosphere here

00:15:29.889 --> 00:15:31.918
and then also as you're sitting eating

00:15:31.918 --> 00:15:34.122
you can see the seagulls flying around.

00:15:34.122 --> 00:15:36.830
Very nice, very pleasant place.

00:15:36.830 --> 00:15:38.545
But I can imagine on the weekends

00:15:38.545 --> 00:15:39.795
it gets very busy here

00:15:39.795 --> 00:15:42.208
because this is just such a nice place.

00:15:42.208 --> 00:15:43.274
And the food is good.

00:15:43.274 --> 00:15:46.191
(seagulls calling)

00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:51.742
This was a great little trip to Bangpoo.

00:15:51.742 --> 00:15:53.671
And this whole atmosphere here,

00:15:53.671 --> 00:15:54.504
And this whole atmosphere here,

00:15:54.504 --> 00:15:55.888
the seagulls are nice to see

00:15:55.888 --> 00:15:57.682
but I'm probably gonna skip feeding them

00:15:57.682 --> 00:15:59.559
but if you come here you
can feed the seagulls.

00:15:59.559 --> 00:16:02.336
And then the restaurant
serves good seafood.

00:16:02.336 --> 00:16:03.439
And then it's just,

00:16:03.439 --> 00:16:05.110
it's pretty close to Bangkok.

00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:08.771
I think this is one of the
closest possible places

00:16:08.771 --> 00:16:10.597
that you can come to see the ocean.

00:16:10.597 --> 00:16:13.417
It's not a swimming beach
but it's nice to look at.

00:16:13.417 --> 00:16:14.695
We're heading back to the car

00:16:14.695 --> 00:16:17.092
and we're just driving
back straight up north

00:16:17.092 --> 00:16:19.188
up Sukhumvit, back to Bangkok.

00:16:19.188 --> 00:16:20.851
And goodbye from Bangpoo.

00:16:20.851 --> 00:16:22.201
And goodbye from Bangpoo.

00:16:22.201 --> 00:16:24.079
Goodbye to all of the seagulls.

00:16:24.079 --> 00:16:25.579
Goodbye, seagulls!

00:16:26.561 --> 00:16:29.394
And Micah has just been sleeping again

00:16:29.394 --> 00:16:30.848
throughout this entire day trip.

00:16:30.848 --> 00:16:35.018
He's enjoying the breeze
though, the sea breeze.

00:16:35.018 --> 00:16:36.107
Thank you all for watching.

And goodbye from Bangpoo.

00:16:48.599 --> 00:16:51.182
(upbeat music)
