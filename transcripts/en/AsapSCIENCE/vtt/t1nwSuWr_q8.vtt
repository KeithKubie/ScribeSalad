00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:08.570
Water is amazing! It's necessary for life
to exist, makes you healthier, and it's incredibly

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:14.179
refreshing - especially after an intense workout.
But is water intoxication a real thing? Can

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:15.759
you drink too much water?

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:19.900
We're often told to drink around 8 glasses
of water a day to stay healthy - but the honest

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.410
truth is that this specific number is somewhat
arbitrary, and no scientific research exists

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:29.160
to support it. Regardless, we know water is
incredibly important; in fact, every organism

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.120
we know of requires water to survive. Not
only does it help the human body to bring

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.500
oxygen and nutrients to the cells, regulate
body temperatures and aid metabolism, but

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.450
it flushes waste out of the body. Sweat out
too much during a sporting event, and you'll

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.760
start to feel a bit woozy. Three days without
water, and you likely won't survive.

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.239
So how could such an essential substance hurt
us? It all comes down to the cellular level.

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:54.900
The water you drink has very few electrolytes
in it - things like sodium or potassium - especially

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.579
compared to your cells. The electrolytes in
your cells allow your muscles and nerves to

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:02.670
work properly, and help to control blood pressure
and blood volume. Without them, your body

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.020
cannot function. Now normally, the difference
in the electrolyte concentration inside and

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.960
outside the cell wouldn't pose a problem,
because your kidneys flush out any excess

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.380
water; however, the kidneys can only excrete
fluid at a certain rate. This means that consuming

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.700
a lot of water in a short period of time creates
a large concentration difference. As a result,

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.700
water is drawn into the cells in an attempt
to dilute the concentration and even out the

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.499
proportion of electrolytes, and this causes
the cells to swell.

00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:32.749
The problem is, unlike other parts of your
body, the brain literally has no room inside

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:37.049
the skull for these newly plump cells. This
results in extreme headaches and confusion,

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.179
leading to seizures, comas, respiratory arrest
and even death.

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:45.560
So should you be worried? Not likely! Cases
of water intoxication are very rare, though

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.520
they do happen in extreme circumstances. Close
to 1/6th of marathon runners develop mild

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.520
cases in their careers, with all endurance
athletes at a higher risk. This is because

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.789
under the extremes of athletic stress, the
body attempts to conserve water. So not only

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:02.169
are you taking more water in, you're peeing
less out.

00:02:02.169 --> 00:02:05.490
Science says, though you're not likely to
suffer from water intoxication, you should

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.400
drink to your thirst - it's the best indicator!

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.400
Don't forget: we have a new video out every day during the Olympics.
