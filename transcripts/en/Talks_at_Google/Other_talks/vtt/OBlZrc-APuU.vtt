MALE SPEAKER: I want to welcome
our guest, Gary Catona, who's

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:10.150
going to be talking
about voice building.

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.690
He has been the voice builder
to the stars in the past.

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:19.250
And we're going to talk about
voice building to the world,

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.030
about all the different
ramifications for what

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:24.320
that may mean to anybody.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.420
You don't have to be
a singer, necessarily,

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.160
to appreciate
building your voice

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.410
and what it can do for you.

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.560
Now, Gary's thinking about doing
this on a global scale, which

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.140
at Google, is
pretty interesting.

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.000
That's thinking really big.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.230
That's a 10x thinking
and something

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.370
that we can truly relate
to and appreciate.

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:47.690
Gary has worked with some
of the greatest singers

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.430
and entertainers of our time.

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.290
Really amazing if
you've had a chance

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.160
to look through the full list.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.910
And we're going to
chat about some of them

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:57.910
today, his
experiences with them,

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.850
what he's learned over
the past two decades,

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.290
and some of the techniques.

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.250
Gary has a master in philosophy
from Penn State University,

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.672
and this directly impacted how
he goes about his tradecraft

00:01:11.672 --> 00:01:13.130
and how hes approaches
the problem.

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.910
So we're going to
discuss how philosophy

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:19.260
comes into voice building.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.770
So from Whitney Houston
to Andrea Bocelli

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.720
to Tony Bennett to Steven
Tyler to even Muhammad Ali,

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.420
this is just a partial list.

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.090
The list goes on and on and on.

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.150
So without further ado,
I want to introduce Gary.

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:38.610
And Gary's going to give
us a little bit more

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.520
about his background and show
you a short introductory video.

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:42.616
So thank you, Gary.

00:01:42.616 --> 00:01:45.909
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:47.200
GARY CATONA: Thanks for coming.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.060
I appreciate it.

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.390
It's wonderful to be here and
to be around so many eager minds

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.210
who are always willing and able
and interested in exploring

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.580
new ideas.

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.980
My story has been
an interesting one.

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.090
I began with a simple
passion to become a singer

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.566
when I was growing
up in Philadelphia,

00:02:06.566 --> 00:02:11.000
Italian-American family, with
Frank Sinatra and the Beatles

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.010
playing both at the same house.

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.830
And I just developed this
passion to become a singer,

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.085
and it started me on the quest
to discover what a great-- what

00:02:20.085 --> 00:02:20.960
a beautiful voice is.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.850
And during that process,
it was a very bumpy road

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.680
because I had to
unlearn much of what

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.020
I was taught by my teachers.

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:30.700
And in the final
analysis, I ended up

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.850
putting together a process that
I call voice building that I've

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.380
been using now for
the past 20 years

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.820
or so that has made
a major impact on how

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:41.580
people deal with their voices.

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.160
And my goal at this point
is to take my process

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.080
and to create as many
beautiful voices as possible

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.930
all over the world.

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.450
So how many people
here are singers?

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.922
And how many have studied voice?

00:02:55.922 --> 00:02:57.630
And how many people
here use their voices

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:58.970
in their profession?

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.780
Everybody, right?

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.690
Are you aware of
the major impact

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.940
that the quality of your
voice has on your work?

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.380
We know that we have
a tremendous response

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:11.970
to the sound of a
person's voice--

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.442
not just what you're saying,
but the actual quality

00:03:14.442 --> 00:03:16.400
of your voice can sometimes
make the difference

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.964
between success and failure.

00:03:17.964 --> 00:03:19.380
This is part of
the message that I

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.034
want to pass on-- that I have
been passing on for some time.

00:03:22.034 --> 00:03:23.450
MALE SPEAKER: And
[INAUDIBLE] what

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.870
is your vision for your work?

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.880
GARY CATONA: The more
I teach, the more I

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.185
realize how important
the voice is.

00:03:30.185 --> 00:03:30.810
Think about it.

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:31.610
We all speak.

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:32.395
We all love music.

00:03:32.395 --> 00:03:33.430
We all love singers.

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.590
Yet it's the one field where
we don't think enough about.

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:41.044
We think working out and the
proper nutrition and so on.

00:03:41.044 --> 00:03:43.460
But very few of us really think
very much about our voice.

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:45.390
And think about how
crucial your voices are.

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.056
I mean, look what
we're doing right now.

00:03:47.056 --> 00:03:49.820
We're talking, communicating.

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:51.595
And your voice is interesting.

00:03:51.595 --> 00:03:54.440
The voice is almost a
mystical aspect of who we are.

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:55.810
Think about it for a second.

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:58.772
In the actual quality
of your voice, you live.

00:03:58.772 --> 00:04:01.230
Your identity, your personality,
your emotions, your moods,

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.420
your feelings, all
within sound waves.

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.190
But how is that possible?

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:06.940
How could mere
sound waves capture

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:08.710
the essence of who you are?

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:10.360
So whenever you're
speaking, you're

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.990
literally transmitting
who you are in your voice.

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:15.660
So it stands to
reason that you should

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.800
try to have the best
voice you can possibly

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:20.740
have to express who
you are, whether it's

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:24.244
in a personal relationship
or in your profession.

00:04:24.244 --> 00:04:25.660
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah,
and obviously,

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:27.260
to Googlers,
elaborating on voice,

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.660
that could be a unique way
of doing things in the future

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.140
to create better
user experiences.

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:35.030
And so we need to think
deeply about voice

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:37.617
and all its technical
implications as well.

00:04:37.617 --> 00:04:40.075
GARY CATONA: And I'm going to
show you a quick little video

00:04:40.075 --> 00:04:42.450
that we put together
that kind of gives you

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:44.786
a summation of my career.

00:04:44.786 --> 00:04:49.090
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:53.364
[MUSIC - WHITNEY HOUSTON,
"I WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU"]

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:14.510
-I understand you met
Whitney Houston back in 2004

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:16.560
after being introduced
by Stevie Wonder

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:17.810
and began working with her.

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:21.750
What kind of a shape was
her voice in back then?

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:23.480
-When I went to
see her in Atlanta,

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:25.610
her voice was in
horrible condition.

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:28.630
Her speaking voice and her
singing voice were both hoarse.

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:31.140
She had about one audible
tone in her lower register.

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:32.880
I was horrified.

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.700
I had this image of her
being a young, beautiful lady

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:37.630
with this incredible voice.

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:39.580
And here she is,
sitting in front of me,

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:41.160
with no voice whatsoever.

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.165
I got her voice
back at probably 75%

00:05:43.165 --> 00:05:45.060
by the time she did her record.

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:49.012
[MUSIC_-_ANDREA_BOCELLI]

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:08.240
-Actually, Gary's system
is the only system

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.070
that I really tried before.

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:13.740
Most of the time, I wasn't
interested in trying

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:15.025
any of the other systems.

00:06:15.025 --> 00:06:19.230
And I did only two to
two and a half weeks

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:21.390
of this voice building.

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:24.031
That is almost like a miracle
because I would always

00:06:24.031 --> 00:06:24.530
give out.

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:26.170
And I did more
singing on that tour

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:27.530
than I had ever done before.

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:31.600
-I think I owe the range
that I have in my voice now

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:34.470
and the fact that I can sing
for long periods of time

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:38.020
with strength and no
laryngitis to Gary.

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:40.540
It's been remarkable for me.

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:42.495
-I noticed that my voice
was getting louder,

00:06:42.495 --> 00:06:45.280
it seemed to project
louder, and that I

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:47.500
was able to go
deeper in tone than I

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:49.790
used to be able to and higher.

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:54.940
So it affected my highs,
my mids, and my lows.

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:59.180
-Taking care of business.

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:02.570
-You always have a lot of
stuff to do in the morning?

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:03.277
-Not too much.

00:07:03.277 --> 00:07:05.110
-They tell me you're
an actor, Muhammad Ali.

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:06.120
Are you really an actor?

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:06.620
-Yes.

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:07.600
I've been acting.

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:09.130
I've deceived the world.

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:13.731
I actually made the people
think that I couldn't talk.

00:07:13.731 --> 00:07:14.230
-Hello.

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:15.930
This is Mike Wilmington.

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:20.430
I'm talking into a tape recorder
on Wednesday, September 17,

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:22.690
or thereabouts.

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:25.100
My voice sounds this way
because of a condition

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:28.450
which has been prescribed
by several doctors

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:31.310
as spastic dysphonia.

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:33.290
This is Mike Wilmington.

00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:36.430
I've had my voice back
now for about two years,

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:39.690
thanks to Gary Catona and his
voice building techniques.

00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:46.210
-When cancer struck "Odd
Couple" star Jack Klugman,

00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:49.020
doctors were forced to remove
one of his vocal cords.

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:51.840
He lost his voice and
nearly lost his career.

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:53.340
Well now, we have
the man who helped

00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:55.790
the star get his voice back
in our "Entertainment Tonight"

00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:56.960
cover story.

00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:58.139
-I think I hear a sound.

00:07:58.139 --> 00:08:00.180
-Well, it's a matter of
taking these muscles that

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:03.330
are by nature very tough
and applying exercise

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:04.760
to make them overwork.

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:07.600
And the result is very
dramatic, and it's very fast.

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:09.970
-It was like finding gold to me.

00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:10.861
I love it.

00:08:10.861 --> 00:08:11.735
And I'm able to work.

00:08:11.735 --> 00:08:12.440
Look at that.

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:13.270
I have the power.

00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:14.340
I can express emotion.

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:16.120
And it's all because of him.

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:18.500
-His other students have
ranged from Liza Minnelli

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:20.125
and the lead singer
of Limp Bizkit

00:08:20.125 --> 00:08:23.720
to Tony Bennett and operatic
tenor Andrea Bocelli.

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:28.010
-To have somebody like that
put his voice in your hands

00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:32.100
and say, make it better,
was quite a delight for me.

00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:34.820
-Catona has also worked
with Lisa Marie Presley

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:36.549
and Grammy-winning singer Seal.

00:08:40.429 --> 00:08:41.590
-Welcome to "Talk of Asia."

00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:42.340
I'm Lorraine Hahn.

00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:45.280
And joining me, international
superstar Liza Minnelli

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:47.329
andher voice coach, Gary Catona.

00:08:47.329 --> 00:08:49.620
-Because I would have said
if I was sitting here alone,

00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:53.520
there's a man called Gary
Catona who I trust with my life.

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:55.490
I'm chasing him.

00:08:55.490 --> 00:08:56.020
I follow--

00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:57.020
-Not romantically, I presume.

00:08:57.020 --> 00:08:57.630
-No.

00:08:57.630 --> 00:08:58.850
-And I want her to chase me.

00:08:58.850 --> 00:08:59.504
So I came here.

00:08:59.504 --> 00:09:00.920
I knew that's how
it would happen.

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:02.586
-No, I knew Gary had
to be here working,

00:09:02.586 --> 00:09:05.920
and I have to take my
lessons because I just

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:09.790
had an operation on my throat,
and I couldn't speak at all,

00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:11.330
let alone sing.

00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:13.060
And I knew the only
person that could

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:18.370
make me sing the way I wanted
to, with God's gift, which

00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:21.730
is brand new vocal cords,
would be Gary Catona.

00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:24.640
That I could get-- I'll just
show you, on the bottom,

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:27.240
I'll do [RASPY SINGING].

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:28.299
That's the bottom.

00:09:28.299 --> 00:09:30.340
So if you go, [RASPY_SINGING]
I'm just a girl who

00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:33.530
can't-- now.

00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:35.040
Do something.

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:36.960
Help me.

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:39.946
[SINGING] I'm just a
girl who can't say no.

00:09:39.946 --> 00:09:41.789
You know, it's all there.

00:09:41.789 --> 00:09:42.330
-Fascinating.

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:44.770
-I love talking
about what works.

00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:47.200
Because it's great
to talk about what if

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:49.300
and what could
be, but damn, when

00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:51.562
you find something that works--

00:09:51.562 --> 00:09:56.552
-And so joining us now is
voice builder Gary Catona.

00:09:56.552 --> 00:09:58.010
-The first point
I want to make is,

00:09:58.010 --> 00:10:01.409
think of the voice in
terms of being a muscle.

00:10:01.409 --> 00:10:02.700
So what do you do with muscles?

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:04.000
-You treat it like an athlete.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:04.583
-That's right.

00:10:04.583 --> 00:10:07.130
So my concept is
you use your voice

00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:10.460
in an exercise routine that
stresses out the vocal muscles.

00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:15.890
As an example, if I do
this-- [SINGING WITH VIBRATO]

00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:20.327
[MUSIC - WHITNEY HOUSTON,
"I WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU"]

00:10:47.935 --> 00:10:48.921
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:10:48.921 --> 00:10:51.520
MALE SPEAKER: Well, that's
quite impressive, Gary.

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:54.686
GARY CATONA: You see
the variety of people

00:10:54.686 --> 00:10:56.310
that I work with,
not just for singers,

00:10:56.310 --> 00:10:57.768
but people who have
vocal problems,

00:10:57.768 --> 00:10:59.920
even medical conditions.

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:02.200
MALE SPEAKER: Now
your approach to it,

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:05.040
coming with a philosophy
degree and having been a singer

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:07.690
yourself, you took a
fundamentally different

00:11:07.690 --> 00:11:09.726
approach than many
folks in your field did.

00:11:09.726 --> 00:11:11.600
So you might be seen
somewhat as a disruptor.

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:12.683
GARY CATONA: That's right.

00:11:12.683 --> 00:11:16.950
MALE SPEAKER: So how did the
quote, "current community"

00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:19.420
of vocal building
and vocal analysis,

00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:21.270
were they receptive
to your work at first,

00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:23.970
or did it take a while to
basically win people over?

00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:25.340
How did you go about that?

00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:26.910
GARY CATONA: It's like
whenever you introduce

00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:29.243
something new that conflicts
with the prevailing wisdom,

00:11:29.243 --> 00:11:30.440
you always get a push back.

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:33.190
And in my case, it
was very severe.

00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:36.200
What I do in terms
of my technique

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:38.640
is the complete opposite of
what everybody else teaches,

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:39.860
for the most part.

00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:41.781
For example, when
you study voice,

00:11:41.781 --> 00:11:43.905
you're oftentimes taught
to sing from the diaphragm

00:11:43.905 --> 00:11:47.230
and to relax your throat and
sing the nasal passages, where

00:11:47.230 --> 00:11:48.460
for me, it's the opposite.

00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:50.860
You spend all your
time in the throat

00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:53.510
and ignore the
diaphragm altogether.

00:11:53.510 --> 00:11:55.990
And these the kinds of ideas
that antagonize people.

00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:58.050
And even when I had
evidence that what I did

00:11:58.050 --> 00:12:00.925
worked, because I had some
really, really nice results,

00:12:00.925 --> 00:12:02.780
even with people with
medical conditions,

00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:07.220
I still was considered
a person non grata.

00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:09.580
MALE SPEAKER: So
often when you're

00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:12.800
this person in any field
or industry, someone

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:15.440
discovers you or
helps the breakthrough

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:19.980
or the aha moment that actually
says, I believe in this person,

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:21.480
and I believe in
what they're doing,

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:23.526
and I've seen
fundamental results.

00:12:23.526 --> 00:12:26.025
Who is the person that quote,
"discovered" you, if you will?

00:12:26.025 --> 00:12:28.080
GARY CATONA: You know,
I had those moments.

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:30.290
It's just remarkable to
think that within the course

00:12:30.290 --> 00:12:32.790
of a year and a half, I had
four people who discovered me,

00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:33.920
so to speak.

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:37.500
Any one of whom would have done
it, but I had four at once.

00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:40.340
And probably the most profound
one was Shirley MacLaine.

00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:43.500
She was about to go on
tour with Frank Sinatra.

00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:45.920
And she wasn't a singer, really.

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:48.634
And she heard about me
through another student.

00:12:48.634 --> 00:12:51.050
And out of the clear blue sky,
I got a phone call one day.

00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:53.070
I'm living in this one-bedroom
apartment in Hollywood,

00:12:53.070 --> 00:12:55.370
hardly making any income
whatsoever, and just wondering

00:12:55.370 --> 00:12:56.680
what I'm going to do next.

00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:58.315
Next thing I know, the phone
rings, it's Shirley MacLaine.

00:12:58.315 --> 00:13:00.810
And she said to me, what
are you doing in one hour?

00:13:00.810 --> 00:13:02.484
I said, let me see here.

00:13:02.484 --> 00:13:03.192
Uh, I'm free.

00:13:03.192 --> 00:13:04.400
She says, I'll be right over.

00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:07.980
She drove from Malibu to
my place in Hollywood,

00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:09.397
and I started
giving her a lesson.

00:13:09.397 --> 00:13:11.396
And within 10 minutes
after giving her a lesson,

00:13:11.396 --> 00:13:13.160
she said, you're
going on tour with me.

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:19.076
And from her came Tony Bennett,
Liza Minnelli, Andy Williams.

00:13:19.076 --> 00:13:21.010
And then I went on tour
with her and Sinatra,

00:13:21.010 --> 00:13:23.642
and that was a whole
'nother story altogether.

00:13:23.642 --> 00:13:25.600
MALE SPEAKER: So at the
beginning of the video,

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:28.350
we heard a beautiful,
familiar voice.

00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:31.720
What was it like working
with Whitney Houston?

00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:32.740
GARY CATONA: Boy.

00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:35.637
Imagine working with one the
greatest voices of all time.

00:13:35.637 --> 00:13:37.220
And what's interesting
psychologically

00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:42.260
is when you teach somebody
that you admired as a fan.

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:42.969
Think about that.

00:13:42.969 --> 00:13:45.051
Imagine somebody that you--
whether it's in sports

00:13:45.051 --> 00:13:45.587
or whatever.

00:13:45.587 --> 00:13:47.920
And before you know it, the
person is sitting before you

00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:50.020
and saying, show
me how to do this.

00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:52.060
One of the greatest
voices of all time.

00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:56.470
She is the embodiment of--
she has so many vocal virtues,

00:13:56.470 --> 00:14:02.000
it's hard to discuss them,
besides her beautiful tone,

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.630
her strong voice, her amazing
range, her inherent musicality.

00:14:05.630 --> 00:14:07.540
It was a wonderful experience.

00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:09.470
And she responded very,
very, very quickly

00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:11.270
to my vocal exercises.

00:14:11.270 --> 00:14:12.770
MALE SPEAKER: Now
when great singers

00:14:12.770 --> 00:14:16.755
like Andrea Bocelli, Tony
Bennett, Steven Tyler--

00:14:16.755 --> 00:14:20.810
one of my all-time favorites--
they're putting their trust

00:14:20.810 --> 00:14:23.320
in you with their
voices, their livelihood.

00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:25.240
That's an immense
responsibility.

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:27.510
What's that like?

00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:29.400
The burden, there's
a certain burden

00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:31.890
and a certain weight
that goes with that.

00:14:31.890 --> 00:14:33.390
GARY CATONA: Well,
it's interesting.

00:14:33.390 --> 00:14:35.056
You have to-- for
people with those kind

00:14:35.056 --> 00:14:37.680
of large personalities,
your first goal

00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:40.624
is to convince that person that
you know what you're doing.

00:14:40.624 --> 00:14:43.040
Because they're used to telling
everybody else what to do.

00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:45.807
So here you are, standing
in front of a superstar,

00:14:45.807 --> 00:14:47.640
and you have to tell
that person what to do,

00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:50.520
and that person has to
listen without compromise.

00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:52.610
Because if the person
doesn't listen,

00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:54.950
the results are not
there, and then you fail.

00:14:54.950 --> 00:14:56.870
So one of my first
goals is to convince

00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:59.510
the person what I do is real.

00:14:59.510 --> 00:15:02.512
And the way I do that is
demonstrate with my own voice

00:15:02.512 --> 00:15:03.970
different kinds of
exercises, and I

00:15:03.970 --> 00:15:05.720
have a pretty strong voice.

00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:09.240
And once they heard
my voice, then they're

00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:11.070
open, more available
to being taught.

00:15:11.070 --> 00:15:13.220
And luckily, my
results are fast,

00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:15.130
so when I began
to work with them,

00:15:15.130 --> 00:15:18.640
they heard the results in
their voices very quickly.

00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:22.270
And before you know it,
they're devoted students.

00:15:22.270 --> 00:15:25.200
MALE SPEAKER: Now working with
that diverse group of singers

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:28.350
and entertainers and other
notable public figures, what

00:15:28.350 --> 00:15:30.520
was the common thread,
the common denominator,

00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:33.880
or common note, if you would,
that you saw between them?

00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:37.860
Was there such an element
that you could identify?

00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:39.610
GARY CATONA: Yeah, I
think the people that

00:15:39.610 --> 00:15:42.460
are really successful
in this field,

00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:45.805
they have a lot of
personality characteristics

00:15:45.805 --> 00:15:49.030
that are in common, one
of which is that they have

00:15:49.030 --> 00:15:51.800
a determination
to be successful,

00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:55.600
and nothing will stop them,
and they have no other choice.

00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:58.502
When I have a student that
says to me, if I don't make it

00:15:58.502 --> 00:16:00.280
as a singer, I'll
go to law school--

00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:02.710
when I hear that, I normally
say, please go to law school.

00:16:02.710 --> 00:16:05.960
Because you have to
have almost an obsession

00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:07.120
to be this kind of person.

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:09.110
Because think about it.

00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:11.720
It's a desire to have the
whole world look at you

00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:13.290
and say, look how
wonderful you are.

00:16:13.290 --> 00:16:14.590
Look how great you are.

00:16:14.590 --> 00:16:17.250
And if you're a real artist,
if you have real talent,

00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:19.540
you have a major
impact on the world.

00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:21.890
That's what being a performer
can do and being a singer

00:16:21.890 --> 00:16:22.637
can do.

00:16:22.637 --> 00:16:23.470
MALE SPEAKER: Great.

00:16:23.470 --> 00:16:25.690
Well, I want to transition
here to your vision

00:16:25.690 --> 00:16:29.240
that you mention upfront from
voice builder to the stars

00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:31.630
to the voice builder
of the world.

00:16:31.630 --> 00:16:34.080
So let's talk about
reaching beyond singers.

00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:37.076
You've worked with a
wide range of people.

00:16:37.076 --> 00:16:38.700
One of the things
that I was intrigued,

00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:40.510
when I was reading
about your bio,

00:16:40.510 --> 00:16:42.640
was that you helped
Muhammad Ali and Jack

00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:45.540
Klugman, who were suffering
from vocal disorders.

00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:47.640
Can you tell us a
little bit how you

00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:49.710
went beyond singing
and entertainers

00:16:49.710 --> 00:16:51.750
into helping people
that may have

00:16:51.750 --> 00:16:54.584
a medical issue or
other injury type issue?

00:16:54.584 --> 00:16:56.000
GARY CATONA: What's
interesting is

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.950
that my initial interest
in developing my system

00:16:58.950 --> 00:17:01.430
was to work with singers,
but my first successes

00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:03.693
were with people with
vocal difficulties.

00:17:03.693 --> 00:17:05.859
And I became very well known
throughout the country,

00:17:05.859 --> 00:17:08.210
in fact, the world,
by returning people

00:17:08.210 --> 00:17:09.656
with damaged speaking voices.

00:17:09.656 --> 00:17:11.030
And Muhammad Ali
was one of them.

00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:13.579
He had Parkinson's
syndrome, which

00:17:13.579 --> 00:17:16.190
causes the voice, the
slur, and the voice

00:17:16.190 --> 00:17:17.810
to get very, very weak.

00:17:17.810 --> 00:17:20.460
And by doing the exercises,
his voice got stronger.

00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:22.630
And then you saw Jack
Klugman in the video.

00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:23.920
He had throat cancer.

00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:25.720
He had his throat irradiated.

00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:27.880
And they took off one
vocal cord and replaced it

00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:29.140
with a prosthetic.

00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:31.430
So when I got his
voice, he had nothing.

00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:33.350
So for me, I wasn't
really sure whether I

00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:35.590
could help the guy out,
to be honest with you.

00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:37.960
But during the course
of a few months,

00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:42.490
his voice returned
very effectively.

00:17:42.490 --> 00:17:45.580
MALE SPEAKER: And there
was another person

00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:47.705
you worked with, a jazz
guitarist, Larry Carlton.

00:17:47.705 --> 00:17:48.830
GARY CATONA: Larry Carlton.

00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:51.040
MALE SPEAKER: Who basically
suffered a severe gunshot

00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:52.070
wound to the throat?

00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:53.236
GARY CATONA: That's correct.

00:17:53.236 --> 00:17:55.110
MALE SPEAKER: And if
I recall, basically

00:17:55.110 --> 00:17:57.227
was left with one
functioning vocal cord,

00:17:57.227 --> 00:17:58.560
and the other one was paralyzed.

00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:00.350
How do you work with
somebody like that

00:18:00.350 --> 00:18:01.920
on an injury that's
that in depth?

00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:03.420
GARY CATONA: It's
quite a challenge.

00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:06.380
Because when you
sing or speak, you

00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:08.850
need to close the
glottis in the throat.

00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:10.370
That causes the
cords to vibrate.

00:18:10.370 --> 00:18:10.870
Right?

00:18:10.870 --> 00:18:13.860
Everybody knows that who
understands music and singing.

00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:15.610
What happens if
one is paralyzed?

00:18:15.610 --> 00:18:17.568
How do you have-- because
when one's paralyzed,

00:18:17.568 --> 00:18:21.010
that means when the person
speaks, rather than doing this,

00:18:21.010 --> 00:18:23.300
that happens, and
all the air escapes.

00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:24.760
That was my challenge.

00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:27.910
So my whole process is
based upon exercise.

00:18:27.910 --> 00:18:30.077
Now, how do you exercise
a voice with only one cord

00:18:30.077 --> 00:18:30.660
that's moving?

00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:33.500
Well, this is how I did it,
through experimentation.

00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:35.090
Here's what I found.

00:18:35.090 --> 00:18:37.720
I would ask Larry
to change pitch.

00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:39.758
And this was his
voice, basically.

00:18:39.758 --> 00:18:43.640
[RASPING] That was his voice.

00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:45.140
That's the voice I
had to deal with.

00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:46.181
So here's what I noticed.

00:18:46.181 --> 00:18:48.320
When I had him change
pitch, on certain pitches,

00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:50.659
the breath would
increase in pitch.

00:18:50.659 --> 00:18:52.450
I'd hear this-- [BREATH
CHANGING IN PITCH].

00:18:54.990 --> 00:18:57.150
That told me that there
was some kind of movement

00:18:57.150 --> 00:18:59.470
in the vocal mechanism
that caused the breath

00:18:59.470 --> 00:19:00.720
pitch to rise.

00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:02.970
So what I did is I
stayed on that pitch,

00:19:02.970 --> 00:19:06.830
and slowly but surely, I
heard this-- [RASPING].

00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:08.940
Before I know it, the
voice began coming back,

00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:10.670
and the whole voice returned.

00:19:10.670 --> 00:19:13.080
What happened was
the one functioning

00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:15.390
vocal fold overcompensated
for the one that

00:19:15.390 --> 00:19:17.976
was paralyzed and,
past the midline,

00:19:17.976 --> 00:19:21.370
had made contact with the
one that wasn't moving.

00:19:21.370 --> 00:19:23.960
So he had the strongest
vocal cord in the world.

00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:29.240
MALE SPEAKER: So that raises
an interesting point, again,

00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:31.670
this vision of voice
builder to the world.

00:19:31.670 --> 00:19:33.570
Can anyone learn your technique?

00:19:33.570 --> 00:19:36.600
Can it be somebody that's a
public speaker at Toastmasters?

00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:37.837
Could it be a young child?

00:19:37.837 --> 00:19:39.920
Is there a certain age
that you would or would not

00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:42.370
teach this particular
technique, or does it basically

00:19:42.370 --> 00:19:43.420
apply to anybody?

00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:46.290
GARY CATONA: Anybody
could use this process.

00:19:46.290 --> 00:19:49.575
I use the analogy of
being like a sport,

00:19:49.575 --> 00:19:52.250
because singing and using
your voice is athletic,

00:19:52.250 --> 00:19:55.610
and it's based upon the use of
muscles in the vocal mechanism.

00:19:55.610 --> 00:19:58.275
So if you have the
proper kind of exercises,

00:19:58.275 --> 00:19:59.400
you can develop your voice.

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:01.750
Now, everybody, no matter
how tone deaf some of you

00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:05.060
might think you are, all of
you have musical ability.

00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:07.849
You recognize rhythms,
and you hear patterns,

00:20:07.849 --> 00:20:09.640
and you remember music,
and you like music.

00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:11.455
So music is a part of our DNA.

00:20:11.455 --> 00:20:13.020
That's how we're hard-wired.

00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:14.820
We love music.

00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:18.000
The problem is transferring
the experience of music

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.380
to the physical
process of singing.

00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:22.340
And what that requires
is the vocal mechanism,

00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:24.136
which is made of
muscles, to correspond

00:20:24.136 --> 00:20:25.510
to when you're
hearing something.

00:20:25.510 --> 00:20:27.670
So if I hear [HUMMING],
I have a [HUMMING].

00:20:27.670 --> 00:20:29.170
That means what I'm
hearing and what

00:20:29.170 --> 00:20:30.517
I'm producing are the same note.

00:20:30.517 --> 00:20:32.350
When you build your
voice, what you're doing

00:20:32.350 --> 00:20:35.310
is you're increasing the
ability of the vocal muscles

00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:36.970
to respond to what
you're hearing.

00:20:36.970 --> 00:20:40.170
So you develop what I call
ear-throat coordination.

00:20:40.170 --> 00:20:43.670
And that's why virtually anybody
who undergoes this process

00:20:43.670 --> 00:20:46.220
could develop a singing voice.

00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:48.400
MALE SPEAKER: So when
you say the process,

00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:51.810
how do you see, beyond the
interaction we had just there,

00:20:51.810 --> 00:20:53.620
but how do you see
technology playing

00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:56.940
an enabling force for you
to achieve your vision?

00:20:56.940 --> 00:20:59.260
How are you going to
reach out to the world

00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:02.182
and teach the world these
types of techniques?

00:21:02.182 --> 00:21:03.890
How do you see technology
playing a part?

00:21:03.890 --> 00:21:05.348
GARY CATONA:
Technology is crucial.

00:21:05.348 --> 00:21:07.690
For example, in my case, I
have a voice building app

00:21:07.690 --> 00:21:10.210
that people use, that's
called Voice Builder, that

00:21:10.210 --> 00:21:12.140
actually builds people's voices.

00:21:12.140 --> 00:21:14.500
It's not as good as being
in front of a live teacher,

00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:16.160
but it works very, very well.

00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:18.130
And with the wonder
of the internet,

00:21:18.130 --> 00:21:20.900
I teach through Skype,
sometimes, for example.

00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:23.794
And technology
itself, we're going

00:21:23.794 --> 00:21:25.460
to start a voice
building academy, which

00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:30.100
will be a one on one interactive
school where we're teaching

00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:34.355
a number of, maybe, 100 people
at once to undergo the voice

00:21:34.355 --> 00:21:36.080
building process.

00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:38.800
So technology is
crucial in realizing

00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:40.386
what I see my goal,
my vision to be.

00:21:40.386 --> 00:21:42.510
MALE SPEAKER: And this can
be a mobile application.

00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:44.090
People can do it
wherever they're at,

00:21:44.090 --> 00:21:46.410
whatever platform they
may be on in the future.

00:21:46.410 --> 00:21:46.700
GARY CATONA: Yes.

00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:47.533
MALE SPEAKER: Great.

00:21:47.533 --> 00:21:50.370
Now, I know you used
Hangouts with my son.

00:21:50.370 --> 00:21:53.000
And it was great to see
that interaction technology

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.250
to bring together you,
in a remote place,

00:21:55.250 --> 00:21:58.280
teaching my son voice
building exercises,

00:21:58.280 --> 00:22:02.750
and the clarity with which you
can hear his pitch and voice

00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:04.020
was extraordinary.

00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:04.847
So it had a--

00:22:04.847 --> 00:22:06.305
GARY CATONA: I
worked with his son,

00:22:06.305 --> 00:22:08.059
who has a vocal difficulty.

00:22:08.059 --> 00:22:09.600
And over the course
of a few minutes,

00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:12.770
his voice began returning and
had a very strong response

00:22:12.770 --> 00:22:14.010
to it.

00:22:14.010 --> 00:22:16.360
MALE SPEAKER: You couldn't
see us, but off the camera--

00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:18.930
he didn't see us-- there was
tears in his parents' eyes.

00:22:18.930 --> 00:22:22.350
That's the first time we heard
his voice come out like that.

00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:25.420
Being that you approached
it from a different angle,

00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:27.940
you wrote a book called
"Revolution in Singing."

00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:29.440
What is that book all about?

00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:32.070
When you say revolution,
what do you mean by that.?

00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:33.720
GARY CATONA: Well,
what I did was

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:36.690
I-- the book was about
the history of singing

00:22:36.690 --> 00:22:39.010
in general, how,
where it originated,

00:22:39.010 --> 00:22:41.115
some salient singers
throughout history that

00:22:41.115 --> 00:22:45.260
have made a profound impact,
like Caruso and Frank Sinatra

00:22:45.260 --> 00:22:47.570
and Paul McCartney and all
of these various singers

00:22:47.570 --> 00:22:49.910
that have made such an
impact on our culture.

00:22:49.910 --> 00:22:53.620
But also, I go through the
principles of great singing.

00:22:53.620 --> 00:22:56.520
I talk about how I
developed my process,

00:22:56.520 --> 00:23:00.190
and I try to overcome-- there
are a number of misconceptions

00:23:00.190 --> 00:23:02.869
about the voice
that are preventing

00:23:02.869 --> 00:23:04.410
many, many singers
that are naturally

00:23:04.410 --> 00:23:05.410
talented from becoming great.

00:23:05.410 --> 00:23:06.930
There are people
in this room that

00:23:06.930 --> 00:23:11.060
would have great voices if
you underwent this process,

00:23:11.060 --> 00:23:13.510
and if you would let
go the old concepts.

00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:16.620
For example, if you're told
that you're stuck with the voice

00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:20.560
you're born with-- you're told
this, and that's not true.

00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:22.720
Because the voice is
composed of muscles,

00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:25.217
you literally can
build your voice.

00:23:25.217 --> 00:23:27.550
The voice that you speak with
is not your natural voice.

00:23:27.550 --> 00:23:30.560
It's the voice that has
evolved over time based

00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:33.706
upon your childhood experiences
and your psychological

00:23:33.706 --> 00:23:35.830
characteristics and whether
or not you're a singer.

00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:39.052
So the voice that you
have is an adapted sound,

00:23:39.052 --> 00:23:40.510
which means you
can take that sound

00:23:40.510 --> 00:23:44.720
and build it with
the proper exercises.

00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:47.439
MALE SPEAKER: Now, when
went in this study field,

00:23:47.439 --> 00:23:49.605
you actually went back to
an historical perspective,

00:23:49.605 --> 00:23:52.040
if I recall, and actually looked
at one of the greatest opera

00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:53.825
singers of all time,
sort of as a mentor.

00:23:53.825 --> 00:23:54.450
GARY CATONA: That's right.

00:23:54.450 --> 00:23:55.770
MALE SPEAKER: And looking
at some of the techniques

00:23:55.770 --> 00:23:57.395
that he did at the
turn of the century.

00:23:57.395 --> 00:23:59.710
Can you elaborate, one,
who he was and two,

00:23:59.710 --> 00:24:02.952
what you learned from looking
at that historical perspective?

00:24:02.952 --> 00:24:05.410
GARY CATONA: The greatest opera
singer probably of all time

00:24:05.410 --> 00:24:07.201
was this gentleman
named Enrico Caruso, who

00:24:07.201 --> 00:24:10.590
was an Italian tenor,
who died in 1921.

00:24:10.590 --> 00:24:12.910
He wrote a book called
"The Art of Singing."

00:24:12.910 --> 00:24:16.180
In it, he talked about using his
throat muscles to create sounds

00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:18.470
and singing from the
back of the throat.

00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:20.895
Now, most of you don't
really understand

00:24:20.895 --> 00:24:21.770
what that might mean.

00:24:21.770 --> 00:24:23.780
But if you study
voice today, you're

00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:26.070
told to sing out of
your throat and to sing

00:24:26.070 --> 00:24:28.608
to your nasal cap, which
is called the mask.

00:24:28.608 --> 00:24:30.316
But what they teach
today is the opposite

00:24:30.316 --> 00:24:33.180
of what Caruso teaches, which is
the greatest voice of all time.

00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:35.180
So how did that ever happen?

00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:37.100
So that was a light for me.

00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:40.000
When I read-- I just said,
this is what Caruso says.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:41.250
We have to take him seriously.

00:24:41.250 --> 00:24:43.277
When he says, sing from
the back of the throat,

00:24:43.277 --> 00:24:45.110
how can you sing from
the back of the throat

00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:46.300
and sing in the
front-- in the mask?

00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:47.500
How do you do that
at the same time?

00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:48.780
It's not physically possible.

00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:51.320
Somebody has to be right,
and someone has to be wrong.

00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:52.700
Caruso was right.

00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:55.700
MALE SPEAKER: So you've often
talked about that he was right,

00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:57.580
but there's a field
of isokinetics.

00:24:57.580 --> 00:24:59.837
Can you tell the audience
what that's all about

00:24:59.837 --> 00:25:02.170
and how you think it directly
applies to your philosophy

00:25:02.170 --> 00:25:03.534
and approach to voice building?

00:25:03.534 --> 00:25:05.950
GARY CATONA: When I went through
the process of developing

00:25:05.950 --> 00:25:07.710
my voice building
system, I discovered

00:25:07.710 --> 00:25:11.000
a kind of exercise program
that's called isokinetics.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:14.920
And what I discovered
is a way of applying

00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:17.520
that form of exercise
to the vocal muscles.

00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:19.500
And I can tell you what
it is very quickly.

00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:25.160
It means taking
muscles through motion

00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:27.250
while keeping the
movement constant,

00:25:27.250 --> 00:25:30.680
while keeping the pressure
maximized at the same time.

00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:32.790
That concept builds muscles.

00:25:32.790 --> 00:25:35.140
So I discovered a
way of applying that

00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:37.510
to vocal exercises
that results in

00:25:37.510 --> 00:25:39.949
very strong, very
rapid vocal growth.

00:25:39.949 --> 00:25:41.740
MALE SPEAKER: So we'd
like to take a moment

00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:44.700
to open it up to the
audience for questions.

00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:46.890
Please, before you ask
a question, make sure

00:25:46.890 --> 00:25:48.319
you have the mic
in hand and it's

00:25:48.319 --> 00:25:49.860
turned on, so that
way, everybody can

00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:52.590
hear your question and
also for later playback.

00:25:52.590 --> 00:25:54.370
So if we can have a volunteer.

00:25:54.370 --> 00:25:56.930
AUDIENCE: My uncle has
spasmodic dysphonia.

00:25:56.930 --> 00:26:00.440
And I was wondering, I know--
I guess he could fly out

00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:03.370
and book a session with you, but
does your app help with that?

00:26:03.370 --> 00:26:07.586
Or is there some sort of like
Hangout session you can do

00:26:07.586 --> 00:26:09.710
or something like that
where you can work with him?

00:26:09.710 --> 00:26:12.370
GARY CATONA: The guy with the
vocal condition on the video

00:26:12.370 --> 00:26:14.300
had spasmodic dysphonia.

00:26:14.300 --> 00:26:17.720
Yes, the app will help the
person, without a doubt.

00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:20.307
AUDIENCE: And you're also
available for like Hangout kind

00:26:20.307 --> 00:26:21.640
of bookings or things like that?

00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:22.880
GARY CATONA: Well, probably.

00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:24.838
Just go to my website,
which is garycatona.com,

00:26:24.838 --> 00:26:26.917
and all of my
information is on there.

00:26:26.917 --> 00:26:27.750
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:29.625
GARY CATONA: You're welcome.

00:26:29.625 --> 00:26:31.500
MALE SPEAKER: Could
bring a whole new meaning

00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:34.410
to a Helpout, a voice
building Helpout.

00:26:34.410 --> 00:26:36.710
AUDIENCE: I'm actually
a voiceover artist,

00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:39.520
and I'm actually on my way to
a recording just after this,

00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:42.690
so I'm hoping I can come
away with something of value.

00:26:42.690 --> 00:26:46.220
As vocal actors, taking and
doing things like e-books

00:26:46.220 --> 00:26:50.970
and long term reading, a
couple of hours at a stint,

00:26:50.970 --> 00:26:52.750
I find that very
difficult, and I

00:26:52.750 --> 00:26:55.820
find that my pitch changes as
I go through the recording,

00:26:55.820 --> 00:26:58.010
so that by the time I'm at
the end of the recording,

00:26:58.010 --> 00:26:59.509
you can actually
go back and listen.

00:26:59.509 --> 00:27:00.990
GARY CATONA: That's right.

00:27:00.990 --> 00:27:04.430
AUDIENCE: What are some of the
controls and exercises that

00:27:04.430 --> 00:27:07.594
could be done to stabilize?

00:27:07.594 --> 00:27:09.010
GARY CATONA: The
problem is what's

00:27:09.010 --> 00:27:11.800
happening is your larynx
is rising over time,

00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:13.170
which makes your voice rise.

00:27:13.170 --> 00:27:16.062
So the way you deal with that
is doing certain exercises which

00:27:16.062 --> 00:27:16.770
drop your larynx.

00:27:16.770 --> 00:27:18.150
And I'll show you one right now.

00:27:18.150 --> 00:27:20.060
Put your finger on
your Adam's apple.

00:27:20.060 --> 00:27:21.660
Everybody do it.

00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:22.670
Everybody go ooh.

00:27:22.670 --> 00:27:22.920
AUDIENCE: Ooh.

00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:24.320
GARY CATONA: Where does
the Adam's apple go?

00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:24.990
AUDIENCE: Down.

00:27:24.990 --> 00:27:25.740
GARY CATONA: Down.

00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:26.980
So watch this exercise.

00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:27.972
[SINGING] Oooooooh.

00:27:35.412 --> 00:27:35.977
See it?

00:27:35.977 --> 00:27:37.560
AUDIENCE: And run
through that cycle--

00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:38.040
GARY CATONA: Run
through that cycle.

00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:41.140
Do it like three or four notes,
up and back, very, very slowly,

00:27:41.140 --> 00:27:41.937
full voice.

00:27:41.937 --> 00:27:43.270
And it'll help you a great deal.

00:27:43.270 --> 00:27:43.615
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:27:43.615 --> 00:27:44.910
GARY CATONA: You're welcome.

00:27:44.910 --> 00:27:46.805
AUDIENCE: --for the
interesting presentation.

00:27:46.805 --> 00:27:47.420
GARY CATONA: Thank you.

00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:50.220
AUDIENCE: What would you say is
the most common mistake people

00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:52.580
make with their voice, that
someone off the street,

00:27:52.580 --> 00:27:54.042
when they talk to
you, you say, ah,

00:27:54.042 --> 00:27:55.250
you're doing something wrong.

00:27:55.250 --> 00:27:56.770
What would you say is
the most common mistake?

00:27:56.770 --> 00:27:58.395
GARY CATONA: For
singers in particular?

00:27:58.395 --> 00:28:00.640
AUDIENCE: For
whatever the-- yeah.

00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:03.574
GARY CATONA: Well, the
mistake-- basically

00:28:03.574 --> 00:28:05.990
first they'll have certain
misconceptions about the voice,

00:28:05.990 --> 00:28:09.380
one of which I spoke about.

00:28:09.380 --> 00:28:12.100
The fact that the voice is
fragile is a misconception.

00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:13.490
The voice is very tough.

00:28:13.490 --> 00:28:16.127
It's able to endure
a lot of stress.

00:28:16.127 --> 00:28:18.710
If you're a singer, the number
one mistake I see with singers,

00:28:18.710 --> 00:28:21.200
they sing in the wrong key.

00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:23.760
People have an obsession
with high notes

00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:26.440
to the point of causing the
larynx to-- whenever you cause

00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:28.810
the larynx to rise
unnaturally, over time,

00:28:28.810 --> 00:28:30.847
the voice begins
collapsing and develops

00:28:30.847 --> 00:28:33.430
all these vocal conditions that
you probably have heard about.

00:28:33.430 --> 00:28:37.040
Did you know that the voice
matures at the age of 35 to 40,

00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:38.090
45?

00:28:38.090 --> 00:28:41.490
Yet in the world, most people in
the rock business, for example,

00:28:41.490 --> 00:28:43.560
by that time, their
voices are gone.

00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:46.550
The very moment when their
voices should be the best,

00:28:46.550 --> 00:28:50.610
they lose it because they're
screaming out these notes

00:28:50.610 --> 00:28:53.300
and not preparing themselves
like athletes the way

00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:55.320
that they should.

00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:55.834
You got it.

00:28:55.834 --> 00:28:58.000
MALE SPEAKER: So there's
still an opportunity for me

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.626
to hit the rock tour at my age?

00:29:00.626 --> 00:29:03.079
GARY CATONA: Can you move?

00:29:03.079 --> 00:29:03.870
AUDIENCE: Hi, Gary.

00:29:03.870 --> 00:29:04.911
GARY CATONA: Hello, love.

00:29:04.911 --> 00:29:08.940
AUDIENCE: So who is the
best singer in the Beatles?

00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:10.805
Who's your favorite
singer in the Beatles?

00:29:10.805 --> 00:29:11.724
Is it really Ringo?

00:29:11.724 --> 00:29:13.140
GARY CATONA: Well,
let me explain.

00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:14.790
A singer is an
interesting thing.

00:29:14.790 --> 00:29:17.852
There are three aspects
of singing, the voice,

00:29:17.852 --> 00:29:19.060
the vocalist, and the singer.

00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:21.710
Whenever-- anybody you want
to consider as a singer,

00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:24.120
think about the
three components.

00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:26.930
The vocalist is being able
to sing on pitch, having

00:29:26.930 --> 00:29:29.710
the right technique, and so on.

00:29:29.710 --> 00:29:32.090
The voice is what's
distinctive about your voice.

00:29:32.090 --> 00:29:34.350
As soon as you hear
that voice, you know it.

00:29:34.350 --> 00:29:37.240
Frank Sinatra, Barbara
Streisand, Stevie Wonder.

00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:38.990
There are people that
are great vocalists,

00:29:38.990 --> 00:29:40.670
but they don't have
the good voices

00:29:40.670 --> 00:29:43.520
because you don't
recognize who they are.

00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:47.360
They make great background
singers or jingle singers,

00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:50.119
but because they
lack the voice, they

00:29:50.119 --> 00:29:52.160
have a problem making it
as an individual artist.

00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:53.420
And then there's the singer.

00:29:53.420 --> 00:29:56.140
The singer is being
able to make people

00:29:56.140 --> 00:29:58.730
feel what you're singing about.

00:29:58.730 --> 00:30:01.890
Somebody could have a bad voice,
not being a very good vocalist,

00:30:01.890 --> 00:30:03.400
but they're very good singers.

00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:06.342
Did I mention Bob Dylan?

00:30:06.342 --> 00:30:07.800
But you see what
I'm trying to say?

00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:09.740
So whenever you
evaluate a singer,

00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:11.250
think about those
three questions.

00:30:11.250 --> 00:30:17.480
How is the person as a vocalist,
as a singer, and as a voice?

00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:19.697
So the answer to
your question, who

00:30:19.697 --> 00:30:21.030
do you think the best singer is?

00:30:21.030 --> 00:30:22.499
AUDIENCE: I always liked Paul.

00:30:22.499 --> 00:30:24.540
GARY CATONA: Do you think
Paul's the best singer?

00:30:24.540 --> 00:30:26.330
Now think about
what I just said.

00:30:26.330 --> 00:30:28.670
Is he the one-- does he make
you feel the most or not?

00:30:28.670 --> 00:30:32.360
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I'd choose Paul.

00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:34.546
GARY CATONA: I'd have to
go with Lennon, personally.

00:30:34.546 --> 00:30:36.609
AUDIENCE: So I've taken
some voice classes, too,

00:30:36.609 --> 00:30:38.650
and one of the things that
was really fascinating

00:30:38.650 --> 00:30:42.890
is if you take guitar lessons,
if you screw something up,

00:30:42.890 --> 00:30:43.930
people can see it.

00:30:43.930 --> 00:30:46.500
They say, OK, change your
position, do this, do this.

00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:49.562
It's a much easier
way of teaching

00:30:49.562 --> 00:30:50.770
because you see what's wrong.

00:30:50.770 --> 00:30:52.860
But with voice, you
really don't see

00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:56.240
a lot of what's happening in the
throat, so you have to listen,

00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:59.710
and you have to interpret what
probably this guy's doing wrong

00:30:59.710 --> 00:31:02.510
and how to-- like my vocal
teacher used to say, OK,

00:31:02.510 --> 00:31:04.080
imagine there's like
a ping pong ball

00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:05.330
at the back of your
throat, whatever.

00:31:05.330 --> 00:31:05.750
GARY CATONA: So horrible.

00:31:05.750 --> 00:31:06.416
AUDIENCE: Right?

00:31:06.416 --> 00:31:11.284
So then, clearly, you're
more successful than a lot

00:31:11.284 --> 00:31:11.950
of ther coaches.

00:31:11.950 --> 00:31:14.530
So what makes you
special in that way?

00:31:14.530 --> 00:31:17.700
Because it seems like there's
an art to it, in a sense.

00:31:17.700 --> 00:31:20.340
You kind of have to feel it
because you don't see it.

00:31:20.340 --> 00:31:22.200
GARY CATONA: Well,
the whole problem

00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:25.455
with the field of teaching,
based upon the funnel effect

00:31:25.455 --> 00:31:27.765
of human nature, is that
the voice is invisible.

00:31:27.765 --> 00:31:28.599
You can't see it.

00:31:28.599 --> 00:31:29.390
You can't touch it.

00:31:29.390 --> 00:31:30.181
You can't smell it.

00:31:30.181 --> 00:31:31.850
You can't taste it.

00:31:31.850 --> 00:31:32.880
You can barely feel it.

00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:34.510
So it happens on the inside.

00:31:34.510 --> 00:31:37.280
So there's almost like a
magical component to it.

00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:39.320
A person stands there
and opens up his voice,

00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:40.690
and all the sudden, this
amazing voice comes out.

00:31:40.690 --> 00:31:42.030
Where is it coming from?

00:31:42.030 --> 00:31:43.450
So it stands to
reason that people

00:31:43.450 --> 00:31:45.325
that are great singers
by nature don't really

00:31:45.325 --> 00:31:47.830
know how they do what they do.

00:31:47.830 --> 00:31:50.900
It's one of the downsides
of being gifted at anything.

00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:53.575
If you're a gifted runner
or a gifted tennis player,

00:31:53.575 --> 00:31:54.950
you don't know
why you're gifted.

00:31:54.950 --> 00:31:56.170
You just have it.

00:31:56.170 --> 00:31:58.880
And yet those are the very
people that end up teaching.

00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:00.287
Think about that for a second.

00:32:00.287 --> 00:32:01.620
That answers a lot of questions.

00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:04.690
How can it be that the field
of singing is in such disarray?

00:32:04.690 --> 00:32:07.520
because the people that have
the responsibility of passing

00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:10.440
on the art form have no idea
what they're talking about.

00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:12.856
They just do it by nature, and
they have to make a living,

00:32:12.856 --> 00:32:14.370
so why not teach?

00:32:14.370 --> 00:32:19.420
So you have to base upon
the vocal study on science.

00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:23.450
And in my case, it's the science
of how the vocal muscles work.

00:32:23.450 --> 00:32:27.390
What I've done is I've aligned
my exercises specifically

00:32:27.390 --> 00:32:31.720
with how the local mechanism
works on a biochemical level.

00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:34.520
And that's the only way
you should teach voice.

00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:37.690
AUDIENCE: Your exercises, do
they help in public speaking,

00:32:37.690 --> 00:32:40.390
in the sense that your
range of tonality,

00:32:40.390 --> 00:32:43.755
is that just a learned
habit, or is there really

00:32:43.755 --> 00:32:44.630
something else to it?

00:32:44.630 --> 00:32:46.040
GARY CATONA: I'm sorry, I
didn't hear the question.

00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:47.840
AUDIENCE: In public
speaking, I tend

00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:52.566
to have a noticeably
smaller range of tones.

00:32:52.566 --> 00:32:54.940
So could your exercises help
in that kind of [INAUDIBLE],

00:32:54.940 --> 00:32:56.200
or is it just a learned habit?

00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:57.295
GARY CATONA: Are you
talking about pitch range?

00:32:57.295 --> 00:32:58.370
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:32:58.370 --> 00:32:59.780
GARY CATONA: Your
pitch, when you

00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:03.480
change pitch, your vocal cords
change length like a string.

00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:05.790
The higher you go, the
longer the cords become.

00:33:05.790 --> 00:33:08.520
What controls that
movement are muscles.

00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:10.990
So again, it stands to
reason that if you exercise

00:33:10.990 --> 00:33:14.250
those muscles, what
happens to that range?

00:33:14.250 --> 00:33:18.170
[SINGING WITH RISING PITCH]

00:33:18.170 --> 00:33:19.320
It goes up.

00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:22.960
So the proper exercise will
definitely increase and improve

00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:24.941
your pitch ability.

00:33:24.941 --> 00:33:27.440
AUDIENCE: So it sounds like a
common theme is approaching it

00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:27.980
as a muscle.

00:33:27.980 --> 00:33:28.980
GARY CATONA: Absolutely.

00:33:28.980 --> 00:33:31.021
MALE SPEAKER: And most
people, through the years,

00:33:31.021 --> 00:33:33.120
have experienced
some form of atrophy,

00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:34.997
in that they haven't
exercised that range,

00:33:34.997 --> 00:33:37.330
and it becomes smaller as you
get older just because you

00:33:37.330 --> 00:33:38.710
don't--

00:33:38.710 --> 00:33:41.250
GARY CATONA: Singing is an
art form, but the basis of it

00:33:41.250 --> 00:33:42.890
is science.

00:33:42.890 --> 00:33:46.000
And there are two different
dimensions that people confuse.

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.990
They try to make the teaching of
singing into too much of an art

00:33:48.990 --> 00:33:50.750
form and not enough
of a science.

00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:51.880
Do you see what I'm saying?

00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:55.320
So if I feel as though
the sound's coming

00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:57.740
from inside my head,
it doesn't mean

00:33:57.740 --> 00:34:01.510
you teach that because that's
physiologically impossible.

00:34:01.510 --> 00:34:04.160
It means you teach it
properly, and then you

00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:06.470
deal with the artistic
dimension in a different way.

00:34:06.470 --> 00:34:09.659
But most teachers don't
understand that distinction.

00:34:09.659 --> 00:34:11.437
So again, think
of it as a sport.

00:34:11.437 --> 00:34:12.770
When you sing, you're an artist.

00:34:12.770 --> 00:34:16.949
But as a student,
you're a voice builder.

00:34:16.949 --> 00:34:20.920
AUDIENCE: I talk with a
very low tone of voice,

00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:25.389
but I would like to make it
higher because I keep getting

00:34:25.389 --> 00:34:30.330
lower and lower and lower,
and I don't really like it.

00:34:30.330 --> 00:34:32.812
GARY CATONA: Well,
I like your voice.

00:34:32.812 --> 00:34:35.270
And I think you should learn
to love your voice because you

00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:36.440
have a very nice voice.

00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:39.500
And a low female voice
is very, very nice.

00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:44.870
Don't try to monkey with
what nature has given you

00:34:44.870 --> 00:34:47.250
to the extent that you ruin
something that's natural.

00:34:47.250 --> 00:34:48.633
You have a naturally low voice.

00:34:48.633 --> 00:34:50.799
I would enjoy it and just
try to-- I would encourage

00:34:50.799 --> 00:34:53.422
you to build your
voice at this level.

00:34:53.422 --> 00:34:55.130
And you'll see, your
range will increase.

00:34:55.130 --> 00:34:56.980
But in terms of raising
your speaking voice,

00:34:56.980 --> 00:34:58.438
I don't recommend
that you do that.

00:34:58.438 --> 00:35:00.320
AUDIENCE: But I sing
with a very high pitch.

00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:02.260
I can sing high
pitch [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:02.260 --> 00:35:04.010
GARY CATONA: I'd have
to hear your singing

00:35:04.010 --> 00:35:07.530
to make a thorough
judgment about that.

00:35:07.530 --> 00:35:09.780
MALE SPEAKER: I think studies
have shown, though, too,

00:35:09.780 --> 00:35:11.980
that the deeper your voice,
the more authoritative,

00:35:11.980 --> 00:35:13.980
whether you're in a meeting
or doing a newscast.

00:35:13.980 --> 00:35:14.938
GARY CATONA: Of course.

00:35:14.938 --> 00:35:17.910
The voice is a highly
psychological aspect

00:35:17.910 --> 00:35:19.380
of who we are.

00:35:19.380 --> 00:35:22.030
It gives us power.

00:35:22.030 --> 00:35:25.130
AUDIENCE: How to project better,
make one's voice lower, slower,

00:35:25.130 --> 00:35:27.900
and cut out ums.

00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:30.160
GARY CATONA: Again, singing,
your vocal mechanism is,

00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:31.070
think of it like a muscle.

00:35:31.070 --> 00:35:32.880
You have to improve the
ability of your vocal muscle

00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:33.970
to create vowel sounds.

00:35:33.970 --> 00:35:38.120
If I go [SINGING] hee,
you're hearing an E vowel.

00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:40.980
You're hearing my throat
making that sound.

00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:42.480
You have to develop
that capability.

00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:43.620
Speaking is basically that.

00:35:43.620 --> 00:35:45.010
It's flexing muscles.

00:35:45.010 --> 00:35:47.260
So by using the proper
voice building exercises,

00:35:47.260 --> 00:35:50.050
you develop the ability to flex
your muscles more efficiently

00:35:50.050 --> 00:35:52.750
and more effectively, and
you produce more voice.

00:35:52.750 --> 00:35:57.000
So volume in voice is greater
pressure below the vocal folds.

00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.510
When you speak or sing,
the cords come together,

00:35:59.510 --> 00:36:01.530
and the breath that
normally flies through

00:36:01.530 --> 00:36:02.940
is stopped to some extent.

00:36:02.940 --> 00:36:05.770
And that pressure is the
source of your voice.

00:36:05.770 --> 00:36:08.590
The greater the pressure,
the more voice you have.

00:36:08.590 --> 00:36:10.680
So by building
the vocal muscles,

00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:12.850
to vocal cords come
together more strongly,

00:36:12.850 --> 00:36:15.720
which prevents more
breath from escaping,

00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:17.442
which increases the
sound of your voice.

00:36:17.442 --> 00:36:19.150
AUDIENCE: Would you
be willing to walk us

00:36:19.150 --> 00:36:21.190
through one of your
beginner exercises?

00:36:21.190 --> 00:36:21.940
GARY CATONA: Sure.

00:36:21.940 --> 00:36:23.940
Here we go.

00:36:23.940 --> 00:36:25.081
Watch what I do.

00:36:25.081 --> 00:36:27.080
I want everybody to find
this part of the voice.

00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:27.570
Watch.

00:36:27.570 --> 00:36:28.361
Do this, everybody.

00:36:28.361 --> 00:36:29.259
Go, uh.

00:36:29.259 --> 00:36:29.800
AUDIENCE: Uh.

00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:31.815
GARY CATONA: But the full voice.

00:36:31.815 --> 00:36:32.870
AUDIENCE: Uh!

00:36:32.870 --> 00:36:33.828
GARY CATONA: That's it.

00:36:33.828 --> 00:36:36.710
Now notice where that's
coming from, from the back.

00:36:36.710 --> 00:36:39.730
Now watch how I
do this exercise.

00:36:39.730 --> 00:36:44.019
[SINGING IN RISING
AND DESCENDING PITCH]

00:36:50.990 --> 00:36:52.116
Notice the larynx was down.

00:36:52.116 --> 00:36:54.573
If you focus on my mouth, you'll
notice where my tongue is.

00:36:54.573 --> 00:36:55.912
Watch one more time.

00:36:55.912 --> 00:36:59.895
[SINGING IN RISING
AND DESCENDING PITCH]

00:37:06.881 --> 00:37:08.990
Now, I want the
men to do it first.

00:37:08.990 --> 00:37:11.570
All the men, do it with me.

00:37:11.570 --> 00:37:12.070
Ready?

00:37:12.070 --> 00:37:13.024
Go, uh.

00:37:13.024 --> 00:37:13.565
AUDIENCE: Uh.

00:37:13.565 --> 00:37:15.080
GARY CATONA: Here we go.

00:37:15.080 --> 00:37:19.916
[SINGING]

00:37:19.916 --> 00:37:20.900
GARY CATONA: Smile.

00:37:20.900 --> 00:37:23.352
Louder.

00:37:23.352 --> 00:37:23.852
Back.

00:37:27.010 --> 00:37:30.950
You are inaugurated into
the voice building club.

00:37:30.950 --> 00:37:33.580
Girls, same thing, only you have
to do it a little higher, up

00:37:33.580 --> 00:37:34.525
here.

AUDIENCE: Uh.

00:37:43.620 --> 00:37:44.870
GARY CATONA: Here we go.

00:37:44.870 --> 00:37:48.965
[SINGING]

00:37:48.965 --> 00:37:49.885
Let's hear it.

00:37:49.885 --> 00:37:52.435
Let's hear it.

00:37:52.435 --> 00:37:54.730
Back down.

00:37:54.730 --> 00:37:56.670
Now what does that
do, that exercise?

00:37:56.670 --> 00:38:00.134
Lowers the larynx,
stretches the muscles,

00:38:00.134 --> 00:38:01.550
and it keeps the
voice in the back

00:38:01.550 --> 00:38:03.067
of the throat where it belongs.

00:38:03.067 --> 00:38:04.650
AUDIENCE: Notice
that I just stood up.

00:38:04.650 --> 00:38:07.100
I naturally do this because
I'm writing a novel,

00:38:07.100 --> 00:38:09.040
and I do open mic greetings.

00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:11.052
And I'm told I do
a good job at it,

00:38:11.052 --> 00:38:14.880
and I've been urged to
do podcasting, which

00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:17.010
is a good idea for
budding authors.

00:38:17.010 --> 00:38:19.090
And when I read, I
also naturally slip

00:38:19.090 --> 00:38:20.690
into different character voices.

00:38:20.690 --> 00:38:21.700
I can't help myself.

00:38:21.700 --> 00:38:25.020
That's what I naturally do.

00:38:25.020 --> 00:38:26.570
Except for my
superheroine character.

00:38:26.570 --> 00:38:27.903
I read that in my regular voice.

00:38:32.540 --> 00:38:34.340
Could you tell me
the name of your app,

00:38:34.340 --> 00:38:36.890
and do you have
any specific advice

00:38:36.890 --> 00:38:43.290
for people tend to naturally do
different character voices when

00:38:43.290 --> 00:38:44.426
they read?

00:38:44.426 --> 00:38:46.300
GARY CATONA: The app is
called Voice Builder.

00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:49.560
It's an iPhone, iPod app
called Voice Builder.

00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:50.620
Again, what you--

00:38:50.620 --> 00:38:51.340
[LAUGHING]

00:38:51.340 --> 00:38:54.612
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
Android app.

00:38:54.612 --> 00:38:55.820
GARY CATONA: That's the plan.

00:38:58.870 --> 00:39:01.554
Again, you're a gymnast.

00:39:01.554 --> 00:39:02.970
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

00:39:02.970 --> 00:39:04.160
That's what you are.

00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:07.760
So if you do the app, you'll
find that your characters will

00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:10.285
be much more believable
because, again,

00:39:10.285 --> 00:39:12.410
all you're doing is
manipulating your vocal muscles

00:39:12.410 --> 00:39:15.160
in a specific way.

00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:18.220
And that's what-- you'll be able
to do that with more efficiency

00:39:18.220 --> 00:39:19.472
by building your voice.

00:39:19.472 --> 00:39:21.180
MALE SPEAKER: And Gary
and I have already

00:39:21.180 --> 00:39:23.622
discussed making an
Android version of this app

00:39:23.622 --> 00:39:25.580
to reach even more people
throughout the world.

00:39:25.580 --> 00:39:27.922
So he's already working on that.

00:39:27.922 --> 00:39:28.630
GARY CATONA: Yes.

00:39:28.630 --> 00:39:30.370
AUDIENCE: At the
beginning, you described

00:39:30.370 --> 00:39:31.940
that most people focus
on the diaphragm,

00:39:31.940 --> 00:39:33.523
and that you focus
on the vocal cords.

00:39:33.523 --> 00:39:35.870
Do you completely
de-emphasize the diagram?

00:39:35.870 --> 00:39:37.750
Or what's the relationship
between those two

00:39:37.750 --> 00:39:38.624
muscles in your mind?

00:39:38.624 --> 00:39:41.210
GARY CATONA: I will shock
you by telling you something.

00:39:41.210 --> 00:39:43.710
All of you have heard
this expression,

00:39:43.710 --> 00:39:45.400
sing from the diaphragm.

00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:46.700
Right?

00:39:46.700 --> 00:39:51.440
Do you know it's physically
impossible to do that?

00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:54.400
When you sing, when
you take a breath,

00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:58.520
the diaphragm drops, and
air fills up your lungs.

00:39:58.520 --> 00:40:01.240
When you breathe out,
which is when you sing,

00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:04.215
the diaphragm is disconnected,
completely disengaged.

00:40:04.215 --> 00:40:06.800
It cannot be used,
even if you wanted to.

00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:10.480
So again, one of the
confusing concepts in voice

00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:12.992
is this concept of singing
from the diaphragm.

00:40:12.992 --> 00:40:14.450
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah,
it's definitely

00:40:14.450 --> 00:40:15.783
challenging conventional wisdom.

00:40:15.783 --> 00:40:18.380
GARY CATONA: So there
are so many myths

00:40:18.380 --> 00:40:19.770
that populate the
field of voice.

00:40:19.770 --> 00:40:22.700
It's shocking.

00:40:22.700 --> 00:40:24.710
AUDIENCE: So I'm
not a singer, but I

00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:28.790
used to be a wind musician, and
I can also talk fairly loud.

00:40:28.790 --> 00:40:31.470
And I've noticed
over the years, it

00:40:31.470 --> 00:40:34.070
seems like there's definitely
a different range of volume

00:40:34.070 --> 00:40:36.290
that people either
have or can develop.

00:40:36.290 --> 00:40:38.110
And I've always felt
like people talk

00:40:38.110 --> 00:40:40.780
about the difference
between being loud and being

00:40:40.780 --> 00:40:41.789
able to project.

00:40:41.789 --> 00:40:43.830
But I've never known if
there was anything really

00:40:43.830 --> 00:40:46.454
there to that, except
I've noticed it in people.

00:40:46.454 --> 00:40:48.370
And I was wondering if
you could say something

00:40:48.370 --> 00:40:50.010
about that, either from
the science about it

00:40:50.010 --> 00:40:51.230
or what you think about that.

00:40:51.230 --> 00:40:52.080
GARY CATONA: Yes.

00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:56.102
There's certain frequencies
that travel better

00:40:56.102 --> 00:40:57.060
than other frequencies.

00:40:57.060 --> 00:41:00.712
For example, in an orchestra,
the piccolo really travels.

00:41:00.712 --> 00:41:02.170
You have to tell
the piccolo player

00:41:02.170 --> 00:41:04.390
to hold back so he
doesn't overtake.

00:41:04.390 --> 00:41:07.679
And it's a thin sound,
but the frequency carries.

00:41:07.679 --> 00:41:09.720
In singing, you have
certain kind of frequencies.

00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:14.450
There's a frequency called the
singer's format, for example.

00:41:14.450 --> 00:41:19.820
It's that part of the voice
that if I go [SINGING] hee,

00:41:19.820 --> 00:41:21.910
hee-- hear that buzz
sound in the voice?

00:41:21.910 --> 00:41:25.409
That's part of the singer's
format, which penetrates.

00:41:25.409 --> 00:41:27.950
You can have a sound that's big
but doesn't have the singer's

00:41:27.950 --> 00:41:30.840
format, which doesn't carry
as much as a voice that's

00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:33.745
smaller but with that frequency.

00:41:33.745 --> 00:41:35.495
So it's the frequency
we're talking about.

00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:40.710
AUDIENCE: I wonder
about that a little bit

00:41:40.710 --> 00:41:43.880
because, like I said, when
I was a wind musician,

00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:45.480
and I could play a
note on something,

00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:48.330
but I know a pro, like--
I was a saxophone player.

00:41:48.330 --> 00:41:50.650
So I could play
something, and Stan Getz

00:41:50.650 --> 00:41:52.600
was able to be 10 times
louder than I was.

00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:54.860
GARY CATONA: He found the
frequency that traveled.

00:41:54.860 --> 00:41:56.207
That was part of his skill.

00:41:56.207 --> 00:41:57.540
You know what I'm talking about?

00:41:57.540 --> 00:41:58.331
That's what he did.

00:41:58.331 --> 00:42:01.830
He was able to find
those frequencies that

00:42:01.830 --> 00:42:05.326
seared through everything else.

00:42:05.326 --> 00:42:06.950
AUDIENCE: I sort of
have two questions.

00:42:06.950 --> 00:42:08.570
One was a follow-on
to what you just

00:42:08.570 --> 00:42:10.780
said about not singing
from the diaphragm.

00:42:10.780 --> 00:42:14.330
Yet there has to be
pressurization because clearly,

00:42:14.330 --> 00:42:16.690
the difference between a
quiet voice and a loud voice

00:42:16.690 --> 00:42:19.820
has to do with the pressure
behind the column of air.

00:42:19.820 --> 00:42:22.930
So how do you describe that if
not singing from the diaphragm?

00:42:22.930 --> 00:42:24.210
GARY CATONA: First of all,
you sing from the throat

00:42:24.210 --> 00:42:25.918
because that's where
the vocal cords are.

00:42:25.918 --> 00:42:26.930
That's the first part.

00:42:26.930 --> 00:42:28.709
The cords are not
located in your stomach.

00:42:28.709 --> 00:42:30.000
They're located in your throat.

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:32.640
Secondly, breath is
crucial to singing.

00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:35.165
But what controls the breath
are the vocal cords, not

00:42:35.165 --> 00:42:36.790
the other way around.

00:42:36.790 --> 00:42:39.630
When you speak, the
vocal folds close,

00:42:39.630 --> 00:42:41.050
and the breath is blocked.

00:42:41.050 --> 00:42:43.650
And the way the
vocal cords behave

00:42:43.650 --> 00:42:46.250
determines how the
breath is maneuvered.

00:42:46.250 --> 00:42:48.530
We have it in
reverse, mistakenly.

00:42:48.530 --> 00:42:50.580
We have the breath
controlling the vocal cords,

00:42:50.580 --> 00:42:52.510
which doesn't work that way.

00:42:52.510 --> 00:42:54.790
And I noticed this when
I began teaching people

00:42:54.790 --> 00:42:56.140
with vocal problems.

00:42:56.140 --> 00:42:58.137
Many of them would
have no breath.

00:42:58.137 --> 00:43:00.220
They'd speak, and often,
their breath would leave.

00:43:00.220 --> 00:43:02.219
And you'd say, well, the
problem with the person

00:43:02.219 --> 00:43:03.240
is a breathing problem.

00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:05.730
By stretching the vocal folds,
all the sudden, not only

00:43:05.730 --> 00:43:08.220
does the breath come back,
but the voice comes back.

00:43:08.220 --> 00:43:12.056
So by making the vocal cords
stronger and more coordinated,

00:43:12.056 --> 00:43:14.285
it literally causes
the voice to be

00:43:14.285 --> 00:43:15.660
produced in a more
efficient way.

00:43:15.660 --> 00:43:18.300
So the emphasis
is on the throat.

00:43:18.300 --> 00:43:20.505
That controls the breath,
not the other way around.

00:43:20.505 --> 00:43:21.880
AUDIENCE: And the
other thing is,

00:43:21.880 --> 00:43:25.947
you were talking earlier
about vocal strain.

00:43:25.947 --> 00:43:27.780
And I was wondering if
you could talk at all

00:43:27.780 --> 00:43:31.630
about the transitions of
chest voice and head voice.

00:43:31.630 --> 00:43:34.920
GARY CATONA: Yeah, one of the
important concepts in singing

00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:37.480
is moving from one
register to the next.

00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:39.110
And it's been the
bone of contention

00:43:39.110 --> 00:43:40.970
for a long, long time.

00:43:40.970 --> 00:43:42.930
And there are various
exercises that

00:43:42.930 --> 00:43:44.840
purport to be able to
show this transition.

00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:52.870
For example, if I go
[SINGING IN RISING PITCH],

00:43:52.870 --> 00:43:54.840
that transition into
that part of the voice,

00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:56.860
how do you get there?

00:43:56.860 --> 00:44:01.080
You get there by using certain
vowel sounds that guide you

00:44:01.080 --> 00:44:03.070
into making those
kind of transitions.

00:44:03.070 --> 00:44:04.940
You see what I'm saying?

00:44:04.940 --> 00:44:07.200
So it's knowing how
to create the vowel

00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:10.385
sounds in the throat that will
guide you into other registers.

00:44:10.385 --> 00:44:12.760
MALE SPEAKER: Well, thank you,
everybody in the audience.

00:44:12.760 --> 00:44:15.106
I did want to ask
one final question.

00:44:15.106 --> 00:44:16.480
And that is, there
was an article

00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:20.514
in "Time" magazine that singing
actually changes the brain.

00:44:20.514 --> 00:44:22.930
And so I want you to tell us
a little bit more about that,

00:44:22.930 --> 00:44:25.240
but I want to know if
the converse is true.

00:44:25.240 --> 00:44:28.460
And that is, does having
someone sing off key change

00:44:28.460 --> 00:44:29.489
the listener's brain?

00:44:29.489 --> 00:44:31.530
GARY CATONA: It can change
this listener's brain.

00:44:31.530 --> 00:44:33.910
I'll tell you that right now.

00:44:33.910 --> 00:44:34.760
Of course.

00:44:34.760 --> 00:44:39.870
First of all, there are certain
theories about why do we sing.

00:44:39.870 --> 00:44:43.600
And some people argue that it
has an evolutionary purpose.

00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:45.635
For example, when you
sing, what happens?

00:44:45.635 --> 00:44:47.830
You're together
with other people.

00:44:47.830 --> 00:44:51.440
You're communing
with other people.

00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:54.130
And you're sharing an
intimate part of who you are.

00:44:54.130 --> 00:44:57.280
At the same time, you're
retaining your individuality.

00:44:57.280 --> 00:44:58.460
Think about that one.

00:44:58.460 --> 00:45:01.900
That's why the vision of
making the whole world sing

00:45:01.900 --> 00:45:03.450
is such a beautiful
idea, because it

00:45:03.450 --> 00:45:04.450
does two things at once.

00:45:04.450 --> 00:45:07.300
It brings people together, but
it allows for individuality

00:45:07.300 --> 00:45:08.790
at the same time.

00:45:08.790 --> 00:45:12.790
So they know, also, that
singing causes certain hormones

00:45:12.790 --> 00:45:15.090
to be released into the brain.

00:45:15.090 --> 00:45:17.090
And it may have an
evolutionary experience.

00:45:17.090 --> 00:45:19.620
But what I can tell you is that
it's a beautiful experience.

00:45:19.620 --> 00:45:20.850
MALE SPEAKER: Fantastic.

00:45:20.850 --> 00:45:22.144
So I want to thank Gary.

00:45:22.144 --> 00:45:24.310
I encourage everyone to
check out his Voice Building

00:45:24.310 --> 00:45:28.884
app, also his book,
"Revolution in Singing."

00:45:28.884 --> 00:45:30.550
Personally, I want
to thank you and what

00:45:30.550 --> 00:45:33.460
you've done for my son.

00:45:33.460 --> 00:45:35.675
It's just amazing to hear
more about this subject

00:45:35.675 --> 00:45:39.340
and to dispel
preconceived notions

00:45:39.340 --> 00:45:42.720
and debunk myths
that have perpetuated

00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:44.550
through time about
singing and the voice.

00:45:44.550 --> 00:45:46.180
So we greatly appreciate that.

00:45:46.180 --> 00:45:49.060
Greatly appreciate everybody in
the audience, our tech support.

00:45:49.060 --> 00:45:50.890
And on behalf of the
Google Talk series,

00:45:50.890 --> 00:45:52.430
thank you very much
for coming over today.

00:45:52.430 --> 00:45:53.846
GARY CATONA: Thank
you, everybody.

00:45:53.846 --> 00:45:59.783
[APPLAUSE]
