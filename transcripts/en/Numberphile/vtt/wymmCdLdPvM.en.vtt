00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:02.640
Well, I wanted to show you
an interesting sequence of numbers.

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:06.260
[Go on]
So here we go
I'm going to start here

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.520
Well, you might notice that I'm missing out
a couple here and there

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:15.820
...29...30...33...34... and so on

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:20.520
Most of them are here but if you look carefully
you'll see that here we are missing four and five...

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:28.560
and down here we should be missing thirteen
and fourteen; 23 and 22; 31 and 32.

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:36.920
Well, there's a supposition, or a conjecture,
that all of these numbers can be written
as a sum of three cubes of integers.

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.540
Most probably best done by example

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:46.720
If I take this number here for example, 29, it means
that I can write this as a sum of three cubes of integers

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:57.200
And in this case it can be written as
three cubed plus one cubed, so three cubed is 27, 
plus one cubed is 28,  plus one cubed is 29.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.520
So it's thought that all of the other integers
have a similar representation

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:08.360
And I should point out you are allowed
to represent your number by negative numbers as well

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.000
So you're allowed to take sums of three cubes in which one of the.. or more of the integers is a negative number

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.840
What's quite striking is that
for some of the numbers, even on this very list,

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.820
it's actually surprisingly difficult
to write down the solution to the problem

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:29.660
To illustrate what I mean we just have to go
a little bit along the line here to number 30,
and I'm going to need a little bit more space,

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.620
but maybe you would care to hazard a guess
as to what the solution to this problem is...?

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.800
[Is it an easy one? is it a hard one? ...]
-laughing

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.420
It's a hard one.
I should say that this was only discovered in 1999

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.700
It was discovered by computer,
it's actually quite surprising I think.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.040
So, are you ready? 
[I'm ready]
OK, let's go

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.060
I have had to write this down, but let's go

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:56.420
Two... two, two, zero... four, two, two, nine, three, two... all cubed,

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:05.300
plus minus two, one, two, eight....
[That was a negative number]
This is the negative number

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:14.940
And there's one more negative number here:
minus two eight three comma,
zero five nine comma, nine five six. All cubed

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.200
[That's amazing!]
Yes it's quite striking I think

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.720
[29 was so simple, and 30 was so difficult]

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.180
That's right. So, as you carry on up the list
you'll find this phenomena continuing

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.900
So, some occasions
where you'll be able to find very small solutions,

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.700
and then just next door to it
there'll be a number cropping up
which seems to have enormously large solutions

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.200
[Are there many other unsolved ones or...?]

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:44.640
Sadly, yes. I'm going to come back to these ones,
but the next eligible one is this number 33

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.760
And, in fact, we still don't know an answer to that one.

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:56.220
So we've not yet been able to find any integers
which when you sum their cubes you can get 33.

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.620
Search has been pretty thorough,
so far they've gone up to...

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:05.860
I think they've gone up to the numbers of size ten to the fourteen; so it's one with fourteen zeros after it

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.980
Within that range,  there are no solutions.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:16.420
[The question people are going to have then is... I mean, maybe this number doesn't belong on the list! Why is the number on the list if we haven't got a solution?]

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.080
That's a very good question, and there have been some attempts to prove that this number isn't on the list...

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:29.820
but, those attempts have failed.
Therefore it is, and it's perfectly allowable
that the first solution might just be ginormous.

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:32.340
[But there are numbers that are off the list]

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.140
There are numbers that are off the list.  
Let me tell you about the numbers off the list

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:47.640
So I'll just write them down again: 
so we had four, five, thirteen, fourteen, 22, 23, 31, 32.

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.720
So you might wonder
what those numbers have in common

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.120
[What have they done wrong?]
-laughing

00:03:53.420 --> 00:04:10.440
Well, ah, their great crime is that they can all be written as nine times an integer, so nine times an integer, K,
plus four, or nine times an integer K plus five

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.000
So for example four is clearly nine times zero, plus four

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:19.980
And for example, 31 here is nine times three,
which is 27, plus four

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:21.020
So they all meet this criteria

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:26.880
And indeed, if you write down any number
which is of this shape,
nine times K plus four, or nine times K plus five

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.600
It will never be written as the sum of three cubes.
And that's something we can actually prove.

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:41.940
I mean, what's going on here, we're looking at equations of this shape, for example A cubed, plus B cubed,
plus C cubed equal to, say for example, 33

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:51.200
So this is an example of what's called
a Diophantine equation
- and this is a very central topic in number theory

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:57.080
It's been studied, I would say, for lots of years,
so they're named after someone called Diophantus,
who lived in about 250AD, a Greek

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:03.500
But thinking about problems like this goes back
even further, some 4000 years, to the Babylonians

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:12.360
But the question is, if you have
a polynomial equation like this, can you first of all
decide whether it has solutions in integers
- that's what we're trying to do in this special case

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:18.760
If it does have solutions you could even ask
how many are there - are there infinitely many,
or just, oh you know, just a handful?

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:23.220
And if there are infinitely many,
can you describe their frequency in some sense?

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:27.940
And this is the sort of area of research
that I'm actively engaged with.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.500
So we do not have a proof
that this has solutions, in integers.

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.700
It is conjectured that this has solutions in integers

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:38.820
All that we can hope to do, at the moment,
is just use a computer and try and find them

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:43.920
[This is not something that can ever be proven by brute force, 'cause there's always another number isn't there?]

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:46.040
Absolutely, yes. Absolutely

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:51.080
So I just wanted to go back to the first number
on the list that we had up here, actually, number one.

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:56.060
You know, we're not going to have to spend
too much time scratching our heads
to come up with a solution to this one.

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:05.060
Right? We could take... you want to have a guess?
- laughs
[Yep, one cubed, zero cubed, zero cubed]

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:11.220
OK so that was easy. So there's at least one solution,
and you might ask, you know, are there others?

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:19.680
I'm going to write another solution: you can write one
as ten cubed, plus nine cubed, minus twelve cubed.

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:27.300
So people that have seen your taxi cab video
might get a bit excited about that particular one
but... let's not go into that here...

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:36.500
[Alright, so you've got... so there are two ways to do this!]
Two ways to do this! And in fact there are
infinitely many ways to do this in this particular case.

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:41.360
And it's not hard to write down
what's called a parametric solution.

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:49.580
So I'm writing one as one plus nine M cubed, all cubed,

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:55.500
plus nine M to the four, all cubed,

00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:02.920
plus minus nine M to the four minus three M, all cubed

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:07.060
and the point of this is that this is valid for any M.

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:14.000
Yeah, so in the first case if I put in M equal to zero,
I get one, zero, zero

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:20.180
If I put M equal to one, I get ten, nine, and minus twelve.

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:23.460
But you could put anything in,
and you'd just get tonnes and tonnes of solutions.

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:27.480
So yeah, in the list that I started with
one is a bit special, in that, in fact, it's...

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:33.420
there's this parametric family of solutions,
and there are infinitely many different ways
of writing one as a sum of three cubes.

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:37.360
There are relatively few examples
where we actually have these parametric solutions

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:42.120
And if we go back to one of the examples
we saw before, so for example, this number 30

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:46.040
It's suspected that there are not parametric solutions

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:49.680
- although in fact it is suspected
that there are in fact infinitely many solutions,

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:53.260
but... they just get big very very quickly

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:57.760
And so as you measure their density
there are very few solutions overall.

00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:01.760
The whole point about a parametric solution
is that there is a formula for the solutions.

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:05.200
You can just plug in numbers
and it'll give you some answers

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:07.000
That's not the case for these other examples...

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.220
or, it's suspected to not be the case for these other examples - you have to work quite hard to find them.
