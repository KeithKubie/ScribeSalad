[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.395 --> 00:00:06.520
MARY DAVIDGE: Good morning.

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.260
I'm Mary Davidge.

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:11.800
I am the director of
campus design in REWS.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:15.580
And this morning I have the
great pleasure and honor

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:18.520
of introducing Bill McDonough.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.410
Bill is a visionary.

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:23.290
He's an amazing optimist.

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:27.670
And beyond that he has had
an architectural practice

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:29.620
and consulting practice--

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:32.710
McDonough Innovation
for over 40 years.

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:37.150
He was the founder of the Cradle
to Cradle Product Certification

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.260
Institute and coauthored
two great books--

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.830
"Cradle to Cradle, Remaking
the Way We Make Things,"

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:49.670
and, "Upscaling,
Beyond Sustainability,

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.030
Designing for Abundance."

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:52.660
Great books.

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:57.550
He's also been a longtime
speaker at the World Economic

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:58.450
Forum at Davos.

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:01.180
15 times he's spoken there.

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.269
So you are in for
a real treat today.

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:06.040
And what you may
not know about him,

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.620
which is pretty
great at Google--

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:12.190
for many years he
has helped us at REWS

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:14.320
to develop our healthy
materials program

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.140
and to make sure that we
are all breathing clean air

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.980
and living in the cleanest
building products that we can.

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.530
So join me in welcoming him.

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.302
It's going to be a
great treat for you.

00:01:25.302 --> 00:01:28.194
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:32.532 --> 00:01:35.180
WILLIAM MCDONOUGH:
Hi, everybody.

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.790
I'm here because
when Mary asked me

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.220
if this was of
interest, of course

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.770
it is, because
Google has been one

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.430
of the most astonishing
leaders in the areas

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.990
that we care about,
in sustainability,

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.660
cradle to cradle, circular
economy and so on.

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:53.810
So it's a real
privilege to be here.

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:59.910
I've worked with Google
for almost 20 years.

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:01.940
So I want to talk about
design as optimism,

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.330
because people ask, what
gets you up in the morning.

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.160
And what gets me
up in the morning

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.300
is the fact that I'm actually
designing for children.

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.050
I have the privilege
of having children.

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.410
One of my children
is actually here.

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.370
And I like the idea, we
design for 10-year-olds.

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.520
And so when you think about
it, the future generations

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.890
are really the
design assignment.

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.600
And it's a great
pleasure and a privilege

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.510
to be able to work toward
those children and their health

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:30.410
and their joys.

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.420
So that's really the optimism.

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.550
It's to make the
world better for them.

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.180
Now, as an architect the
first job of an architect

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.140
is to change the way you see.

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.220
Then we rearrange furniture.

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.260
Then we build.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.540
So start by changing
the way you see.

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:49.360
This poem by Hildegarde
Von Bingen from 1124--

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.970
"glance at the sun, see
the moon and the stars,

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.410
gaze at the beauty
of earth's greenings.

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.530
Now, think."

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.590
This is a really
important set of phrases

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:09.077
because, glance, see, gaze,
think is really important,

00:03:09.077 --> 00:03:10.910
especially when we
realize what a delight it

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:15.680
is to be here on this planet
in the natural context.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.640
But this last
section concerns me

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:25.340
because the language we use here
can be so sadly interpreted.

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.450
All nature is at the
disposal of humankind.

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:32.390
We are to work with it for
without it we cannot survive.

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.830
This is what translates
into sustainability.

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:39.530
I won the presidential award
for sustainable development

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.170
from President Clinton in 1996.

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:47.060
And we were in the ceremony,
and one of the reporters

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.510
came up and said,
Mr. Sustainable,

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:52.470
what does it all mean?

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.740
And I remember looking
at him and saying,

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:57.910
I'm not that really
interested in sustainability.

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:00.320
What's your relationship
to your spouse?

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:04.980
If you say, sustainable,
I'd say, I'm sorry.

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.880
It sounds kind of boring really.

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:08.170
What is this, maintenance?

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:11.530
So it's really important to
look at this these phrases

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:14.920
because this is about a
concept known as usufruct.

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.000
It's the idea that things
are there for our use.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.500
Right?

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:19.930
And they're there for our use.

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.060
But if you go to
native peoples, they

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.444
talk about being in relation
with the natural world.

00:04:25.444 --> 00:04:26.860
And that's really
I think what I'd

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.770
like to talk about today--
use, but also relationships.

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:34.600
So I see us all as designers
because we all have intentions.

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.956
And design is the first
signal of human intention.

00:04:38.956 --> 00:04:40.330
So when you get
up in the morning

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:43.300
you have intentions to make
Google more sustainable here

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:44.060
in New York.

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.560
Right.

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:45.980
You have intentions
every morning,

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:47.860
and then you have to go out
there and see how well you're

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.318
doing against those, and try
to get everybody else to align

00:04:50.318 --> 00:04:51.920
with your intentions.

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:54.580
So I think design is intention.

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:58.119
And so what is our intention,
to make the world a worse place?

00:04:58.119 --> 00:05:00.160
Anybody got that when they
get up in the morning?

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.967
Like, I'm going to get out
there and do something worse.

00:05:03.967 --> 00:05:05.050
It's hard to imagine that.

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:06.160
Really?

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.980
I'm sure there are people
who are doing that,

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:11.620
but perhaps not intentionally.

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:13.130
So that becomes a question.

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:15.580
How about, let's get out
there and be less bad?

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:17.270
Oh, really?

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:19.120
See, being less bad
is not being good.

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:23.140
It's being bad by
definition, just less so.

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:27.779
So let's get out there
and be bad, just less so.

00:05:27.779 --> 00:05:29.070
It's hard to imagine, isn't it?

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:30.850
But that's what we do.

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:34.060
So let's start with where
we are and see if we

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:35.380
can see something different.

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:38.730
So for me, I was born
in Tokyo in 1951.

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:42.674
And as a baby we would wake
up in the middle of the night.

00:05:42.674 --> 00:05:44.340
We lived in a traditional
Japanese house

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:45.630
with paper walls.

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:47.580
And we would hear
the farmers coming in

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:49.680
to collect our
sewage to take back

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.590
to the farms with their
oxcarts on the cobblestones.

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:53.409
They'd wake us up.

00:05:53.409 --> 00:05:55.200
And my mother would
come in and put us back

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.560
to sleep by singing
folk songs from Alabama

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:01.530
with her southern accent
in Japanese with words

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:05.160
she was making up that
had to do with poop.

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:07.170
And it was about
the honey wagons

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:09.684
coming to collect the night
soil to take it to the farms

00:06:09.684 --> 00:06:11.100
to bring us our
food the next day.

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:12.960
And you're three years
old, and your mother

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:16.410
is singing poop
songs in Japanese

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:18.020
with a southern accent.

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:19.530
Anyway, heaven.

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:21.360
So there it was.

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:25.830
So I always thought the cities
and the farms are one organism.

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:28.830
But I also became
aware of Hiroshima,

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:34.350
because I was five years old
when I discovered Hiroshima.

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:36.510
And it started with a
picture in Life Magazine.

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:38.850
And I looked at it I
said, what is this?

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:42.270
And they said, this is war.

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:44.707
War is when we
kill the children.

00:06:44.707 --> 00:06:47.040
So what I'm looking at here
is the idea of waging peace.

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:49.689
And so when I got to college,
I went to the physics professor

00:06:49.689 --> 00:06:52.230
and I said, how do you make a
city disappear in five seconds?

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:55.500
It takes thousands of years
to make things and seconds

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:56.940
to destroy them.

00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:58.080
Building is slow.

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:00.120
Destruction is fast.

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:01.192
How is that possible?

00:07:01.192 --> 00:07:03.150
And he gave me the special
theory of relativity

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:04.800
and said here, read this.

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:05.715
Solve this equation.

00:07:05.715 --> 00:07:07.160
E equals mc squared.

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:08.760
All right, you're
all smart people.

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:10.650
Have you all solved
E equals mc squared?

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:12.011
Anybody here?

00:07:12.011 --> 00:07:12.510
Ha.

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:13.530
What to do it?

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:15.630
Why not.

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:17.520
If you ask the question,
how does a city

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:19.290
disappear, all of
a sudden it starts

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:20.970
to look a little
different, because c

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:22.300
is the number in the constant.

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:25.060
So that's to me almost
infinity, because it's bigger

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:26.270
than I can imagine--

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:27.172
the light and then.

00:07:27.172 --> 00:07:29.380
And then square it, just in
case it's not big enough.

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:29.879
All right.

00:07:29.879 --> 00:07:32.250
So call it almost
infinity squared.

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:33.030
Oh boy.

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:36.330
And then that means that if m
is in any way a positive number,

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:40.530
as in one hydrogen atom,
then the e is almost infinity

00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:41.670
squared.

00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:44.584
That is the atom bomb.

00:07:44.584 --> 00:07:47.860
There it is-- nuclear power.

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:49.710
But, if we then
look at the planet

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:51.880
we realize that that's
coming from the sun,

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:54.810
and it hits the earth, which
is materials and water--

00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:56.552
mass, m.

00:07:56.552 --> 00:07:59.010
And Einstein was really dealing
with physics and chemistry.

00:07:59.010 --> 00:08:00.630
Isn't that interesting?

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:03.265
But who are we?

00:08:03.265 --> 00:08:05.030
See, we are not
physics and chemistry.

00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:07.990
We're what happened when
those two things get together.

00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:09.600
We're biology.

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:11.660
And so it's interesting
to note in Latin

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:15.190
that the roots for these
three words are the same--

00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:20.850
humous, human, humility.

00:08:20.850 --> 00:08:24.290
To be humble is to be grounded.

00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:25.400
Isn't that something?

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:26.910
We are of the soil.

00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:29.570
So Francis Crick
printed out, nine years

00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:32.690
after discovering DNA at
Cambridge with James Watson,

00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:34.400
that in order to
be a living thing

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:38.840
you have to have growth,
because otherwise you're dying.

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:41.794
If you have more cells dying
than growing, you're dying.

00:08:41.794 --> 00:08:44.210
So you have to have income if
you've going to have growth.

00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:45.720
And income comes from the sun.

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:49.190
It comes from carbon from
the atmosphere and nitrogen

00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:50.270
from the atmosphere.

00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:53.300
And you have to have an
open metabolism of chemicals

00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:55.490
operating for the
benefit of the organisms

00:08:55.490 --> 00:08:57.570
and their reproduction.

00:08:57.570 --> 00:09:00.200
So, here we go.

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:03.080
So I thought, well, what if
we could design with this?

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:05.750
So let's first start
by saying, what

00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:07.640
is going with all this
eco-efficiency stuff?

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:12.020
We're all trying to be less
bad, and think I'm being good.

00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:13.370
So let's have a goal.

00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:15.044
Let's make a less
bad goal and see

00:09:15.044 --> 00:09:17.210
how excited you are about
getting up in the morning.

00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:18.159
Let's be optimistic.

00:09:18.159 --> 00:09:19.575
We're going to
make a world that's

00:09:19.575 --> 00:09:22.370
less unsafe, less unhealthy,
less unjust, with less

00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:25.790
polluted air, less polluted
soil, water, and power,

00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:26.900
and economically driven.

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:28.100
How are we doing?

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:28.670
Is this it?

00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:30.850
Get up in the morning,
go get it done.

00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:31.549
Right?

00:09:31.549 --> 00:09:32.840
Whereas you know how to search.

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:35.210
Why don't you just search for
this. a delightfully diverse,

00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:36.560
safe, healthy, and just world--

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:39.050
with clean air, soil, water,
and power-- economically,

00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:42.820
equitably, ecologically,
and elegantly enjoyed.

00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:44.610
There.

00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:49.310
So, if all we do
is report as we see

00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:51.600
in so many corporate
sustainability

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:58.470
reporting and corporate social
responsibility reporting,

00:09:58.470 --> 00:10:00.420
we see all these
charts like this, even

00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:02.530
with carbon dioxide emissions.

00:10:02.530 --> 00:10:07.540
It's like, I'm going to reduce
my emissions by 20% by 2020,

00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:09.640
and my goal is zero.

00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:13.500
Toxins-- I'm going to reduce
my toxins by 20% by 2020.

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:15.480
My goal is zero.

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:16.230
Really.

00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:17.640
Think about that for a minute.

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:21.026
You're telling the children,
your goal is nothing,

00:10:21.026 --> 00:10:22.650
and they're making
it difficult for you

00:10:22.650 --> 00:10:25.180
to do nothing, because you
have to feed and clothe them.

00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:26.400
That's not too exciting.

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:30.516
And then you're telling us
what you're not going to do.

00:10:30.516 --> 00:10:32.640
That would be like me
jumping in a taxi and saying,

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:36.490
quick, I'm not going
to the airport.

00:10:36.490 --> 00:10:40.260
Is this really useful,
what we're not going to do?

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.480
So, what if we
take this and say,

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:44.460
let's not make that
on the top chart.

00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:46.300
Let's put that
underneath, and say,

00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:50.360
what we don't want we put below,
what we do want we put above.

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:53.310
And let's just imagine
having zero of the bads

00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:55.860
and 100% of the goods.

00:10:55.860 --> 00:11:00.010
We talk about selling
goods and services.

00:11:00.010 --> 00:11:02.730
Well, what if you've actually
thought about it and said,

00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:04.650
I sell bads.

00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:08.060
Today I'm going to
try to sell less bads.

00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:10.166
We call them goods.

00:11:10.166 --> 00:11:11.790
And then we also
realize this year, I'm

00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:14.070
sure you're aware, that
most of the economy

00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:16.690
is actually trading,
and the amount that's

00:11:16.690 --> 00:11:19.740
in goods and services is
actually probably about 20%.

00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:22.560
The rest of its arbitrage and
fooling around with numbers.

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:26.190
So the actual basis of the
economy is a small part of it,

00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:28.890
but it's fundamental because
it's the context in which we

00:11:28.890 --> 00:11:29.940
have life.

00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:32.100
So our choices-- are we
designing for the top part

00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:32.766
of this picture.

00:11:32.766 --> 00:11:35.190
Are we designing for the
bottom part of this picture?

00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:37.600
So that's the question.

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:38.370
So let's go do it.

00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:39.960
What is design for good?

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:43.240
So the sustainable development
goals-- there's 17 of them--

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:44.740
have been put forward
by the UN now.

00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:47.670
They're much, I think, better
than the former millennial

00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:49.220
goals because
they're quite precise

00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:50.220
and they're quite clear.

00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:52.110
And there's nothing here
I think anybody here

00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:54.480
would say is not a good idea.

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:56.860
And let us know if you think so.

00:11:56.860 --> 00:11:59.439
And the circular economy is
certainly an important one,

00:11:59.439 --> 00:12:00.480
but it's just right here.

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:01.200
It's number 12.

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:02.360
It's one.

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:04.630
But a lot of business
people, when they say,

00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:06.790
oh 17 goals, how
can do all that?

00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:08.250
Well you can actually.

00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:09.180
And I'll show you now.

00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:10.638
And will cradle to
cradle thinking,

00:12:10.638 --> 00:12:13.793
if you do material health,
circular economy, material

00:12:13.793 --> 00:12:17.730
re-utilization, renewable
energy, water stewardship,

00:12:17.730 --> 00:12:21.450
and social fairness, you
can do all 17 at once.

00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:23.760
But it's not going to help
us, for example, to have

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:27.630
a circular economy circulating
bads, because all you're doing

00:12:27.630 --> 00:12:29.840
is recirculating the bads.

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:32.020
If you have toxic products
and you recirculate them,

00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:33.285
you retoxify.

00:12:33.285 --> 00:12:35.700
So you're putting the "re"
back into the resource.

00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:38.460
But what if the source is toxic?

00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:40.080
Just remember, a
toxin is a material

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:42.510
in the wrong place, the wrong
dose, the wrong duration.

00:12:42.510 --> 00:12:44.400
Water is highly toxic.

00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:48.690
If I surround you with this
for six minutes, you're dead.

00:12:48.690 --> 00:12:51.090
If you jump out of an
airplane and hit the ocean

00:12:51.090 --> 00:12:56.130
at terminal velocity, very, very
short duration, very big dose--

00:12:56.130 --> 00:12:56.830
you're dead.

00:12:56.830 --> 00:12:59.940
So materials in the wrong place,
wrong dose, wrong duration

00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:00.540
are toxic.

00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:03.030
We don't say to the
children of Flint,

00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:08.730
we're going to reduce the lead
in your water by 20% by 2020.

00:13:08.730 --> 00:13:11.730
When you have a toxin, you stop.

00:13:11.730 --> 00:13:13.160
You stop.

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:15.380
So starting in 1992, working
with Michael Braungart,

00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:19.020
a chemist, we created
criteria that we use.

00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:20.910
No more cancer,
no more disruption

00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:22.860
of endocrine systems,
genetic mutations,

00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:25.200
reproductive toxicities,
and birth defects.

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:27.030
Why can't we design these out?

00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:29.880
Precautionary principle-- if
it could cause that problem,

00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:31.050
why have it?

00:13:31.050 --> 00:13:31.660
Just move on.

00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:33.510
Don't argue about
the little doses.

00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:35.490
Talk about getting rid of it.

00:13:35.490 --> 00:13:37.530
We looked at environmental
criteria-- toxicity

00:13:37.530 --> 00:13:41.160
for fish, for vertebrates,
invertebrates, plants.

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:44.450
We looked at toxic heavy
metals, persistence and so on.

00:13:44.450 --> 00:13:46.950
And then we want to know where
it comes from, where it goes,

00:13:46.950 --> 00:13:50.230
how's it being managed,
how does it affect people?

00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:52.260
So we developed a
certification program

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:54.170
which is now in
the public domain

00:13:54.170 --> 00:13:56.010
for constant improvement--

00:13:56.010 --> 00:14:00.020
third-party, independent,
peer reviewed.

00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:02.860
And this is what we shared
with Google as well.

00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:04.800
So in this search for
the good, let's just

00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:06.485
keep it simple for the kids.

00:14:06.485 --> 00:14:07.980
All right?

00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:11.890
Good, clean water is good.

00:14:11.890 --> 00:14:14.610
Dirty water is bad.

00:14:14.610 --> 00:14:16.620
So when you think
about trying to deal

00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:21.300
with platonic perfections
of truth, beauty,

00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:31.530
and equity, and rights, and the
humanism of our relationships,

00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:35.790
morals, ethics, you can
talk about the good.

00:14:35.790 --> 00:14:38.790
If you look at Aristotelian
science and math

00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:42.240
and statistical significance,
which Google obviously

00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:47.040
is a part and a practitioner
of statistical significance,

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:49.920
then you've got the math.

00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:50.950
Right.

00:14:50.950 --> 00:14:53.650
So if we try and
put this together,

00:14:53.650 --> 00:14:55.560
we realize to start
with the good.

00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:57.120
It's easier than
right and wrong,

00:14:57.120 --> 00:15:01.310
because right and wrong lead us
to politics and other things.

00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:02.560
Good and bad are pretty basic.

00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:05.430
So let's say if we have good
materials, good economy,

00:15:05.430 --> 00:15:09.030
good energy, good water, and
good lives, what would we do?

00:15:09.030 --> 00:15:11.670
So good materials would
be safe, healthy for

00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:13.440
ecologically and human systems.

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:16.740
They would be biological
and technical nutrients.

00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:18.120
That would be first--

00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:20.040
so things that go
back to nature, things

00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:21.750
that go back to industry.

00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:24.780
What I want from this cup
that we were drinking out

00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:26.130
of here that was PLA--

00:15:26.130 --> 00:15:26.880
it's compostable.

00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:29.220
That can go back to
the biological cycle.

00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:30.870
This is polyester terephthalate.

00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:32.250
This is polyethylene.

00:15:32.250 --> 00:15:34.860
This can go back to
technical material.

00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:38.730
So let's just imagine it that
way-- two nutrient cycles.

00:15:38.730 --> 00:15:40.582
A good economy would
be circular, of course,

00:15:40.582 --> 00:15:42.040
putting the "re"
back in resources,

00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:46.150
but only if the resource
itself is safe and healthy.

00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:48.880
So it's quality
first, then quantity.

00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:51.850
Sharing-- Uber, Airbng--

00:15:51.850 --> 00:15:55.120
sharing things that we could use
to get more utility from them

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:56.530
of course is a good idea.

00:15:56.530 --> 00:15:58.591
But finally shared,
because it was pointed out

00:15:58.591 --> 00:16:01.090
at the World Economic Forum
that eight people in this world,

00:16:01.090 --> 00:16:03.190
individuals, six of
whom are American,

00:16:03.190 --> 00:16:06.940
have the equivalent wealth so
three and 1/2 billion people.

00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:10.190
The bottom half of
the economic spectrum.

00:16:10.190 --> 00:16:12.870
So is that shared?

00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:14.830
Then we think about
the linear economy.

00:16:14.830 --> 00:16:17.242
And what we do is
take, make, and waste.

00:16:17.242 --> 00:16:18.700
And so as long as
we do that, we're

00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:19.783
going to run out of stuff.

00:16:19.783 --> 00:16:22.420
And everybody worries
about decoupling materials

00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:27.746
from our economy because of the
problems with their connection.

00:16:27.746 --> 00:16:29.620
But if you then put it
in a circular economy,

00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:31.900
we can start to think
about how we might even

00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:34.790
be able to restore the natural
world with an economy that

00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:35.710
reuses.

00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:37.900
So we've been working with
companies like Steelcase,

00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:40.244
Herman Miller and
so to design chairs

00:16:40.244 --> 00:16:41.285
that can be disassembled.

00:16:41.285 --> 00:16:42.993
Say a chair like this--
it's very simple.

00:16:42.993 --> 00:16:43.830
It's got a foam.

00:16:43.830 --> 00:16:44.990
It's got a polymer.

00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:46.910
It has a fabric.

00:16:46.910 --> 00:16:50.230
This one I think is a polyester.

00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:53.050
And then you've got
steel, rubber, and so on.

00:16:53.050 --> 00:16:55.133
Now these can be designed
to go back into systems.

00:16:55.133 --> 00:16:55.633
Fine.

00:16:55.633 --> 00:16:57.591
Now we have to figure
out how to get that done.

00:16:57.591 --> 00:16:59.560
We work in the carpet
industry very vigorously.

00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:01.090
What you want from a
carpet, we pointed out,

00:17:01.090 --> 00:17:03.631
is just service of the carpet--
acoustics, appearance, and so

00:17:03.631 --> 00:17:04.310
on.

00:17:04.310 --> 00:17:06.520
And if you think of it
as a relationship instead

00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:09.910
of a resource, the carpet
can be sold to the customer,

00:17:09.910 --> 00:17:11.650
but taken back by
the carpet company

00:17:11.650 --> 00:17:13.540
as their raw
material in 10 years.

00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:16.329
And then we can recycle 1.4
billion pounds of carbon

00:17:16.329 --> 00:17:19.190
material every year and have
a perpetual carbon industry,

00:17:19.190 --> 00:17:21.670
if we design it cradle to cradle
and it's safe and healthy,

00:17:21.670 --> 00:17:23.410
and we use renewable
power and so on.

00:17:23.410 --> 00:17:26.170
Change the carpet, the world
gets better, more jobs.

00:17:26.170 --> 00:17:27.126
Good.

00:17:27.126 --> 00:17:28.750
What's really happening
there is you're

00:17:28.750 --> 00:17:32.200
storing your materials on
your customer's floors.

00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:35.620
So when we look at
biological nutrition,

00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:40.300
we do textiles where we've
done cotton polyesters--

00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:43.270
excuse me, cotton,
wool, ramie and so on.

00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:45.550
And we just announced
two weeks ago

00:17:45.550 --> 00:17:49.745
in Amsterdam, the first 100%
of the molecules assessed

00:17:49.745 --> 00:17:53.350
for ecological and human health
t-shirt at a mass market price.

00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:55.240
They're making 1/2
a million of them--

00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:57.280
C&amp;A. It's pretty exciting.

00:17:57.280 --> 00:18:01.850
So 100% of molecules assessed
for ecological human health.

00:18:01.850 --> 00:18:04.360
So the future involves
mining of a different sort.

00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:05.710
This is mining circuit boards.

00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:09.430
If you mine gold out in nature,
it's $210 a ton production.

00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:13.060
If you mine it from
circuit boards from phones,

00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:14.620
it's worth $27,000 a ton.

00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:17.392
And we can get it done
without any contamination.

00:18:17.392 --> 00:18:18.350
It's quite astonishing.

00:18:18.350 --> 00:18:20.980
These factories can
be self-contained.

00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:23.440
When we looked at a washing
machine 25 years ago and said,

00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:24.310
it's really a service.

00:18:24.310 --> 00:18:25.351
You want to wash clothes.

00:18:25.351 --> 00:18:28.065
You don't need to own rubber
gaskets and steel and glass,

00:18:28.065 --> 00:18:30.190
everybody said, well you're
a communist because you

00:18:30.190 --> 00:18:31.355
don't believe in ownership.

00:18:31.355 --> 00:18:32.980
And we're saying,
well, what do I need?

00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:34.210
I mean, think about a building.

00:18:34.210 --> 00:18:36.376
This is a building we
designed for Bosch and Siemens

00:18:36.376 --> 00:18:37.390
who make, guess what?

00:18:37.390 --> 00:18:38.440
Washing machines.

00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:39.770
And think of the building.

00:18:39.770 --> 00:18:40.780
It's a showroom.

00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:42.040
It's a washing machine.

00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:44.860
It's a giant vessel
with people all over it.

00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:47.620
But the fact is that you can
have these on a 15-year lease.

00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:50.384
And the materials are valuable
and valuable to the people

00:18:50.384 --> 00:18:51.550
who can use those materials.

00:18:51.550 --> 00:18:52.240
Not you.

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:53.762
You get to wash the clothes.

00:18:53.762 --> 00:18:54.970
Here you get to work or live.

00:18:54.970 --> 00:18:57.880
This building can be converted
to housing in the future.

00:18:57.880 --> 00:18:59.620
In Amsterdam we're
doing a big project

00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:01.578
where we look at the
materials and the building

00:19:01.578 --> 00:19:03.790
as assets, perpetual assets.

00:19:03.790 --> 00:19:05.979
So we design them with
our computer coding

00:19:05.979 --> 00:19:07.270
so we know where everything is.

00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:09.632
The steel beam can be
sold as a steel beam

00:19:09.632 --> 00:19:10.840
if the building's taken down.

00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:13.570
If you do it this way,
design for disassembly

00:19:13.570 --> 00:19:16.120
with the buildings
as perpetual assets,

00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:19.300
the cost of tearing down
a building in 15 years

00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:21.670
if the bank ends up with it,
to get it out of the way,

00:19:21.670 --> 00:19:23.290
is 80 euros a square meter.

00:19:23.290 --> 00:19:26.110
The value of selling it,
if we do it this way,

00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:28.070
is about 120 euros
a square meter.

00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:31.610
So there's a spread of about 200
euros a square meter, about $20

00:19:31.610 --> 00:19:33.970
per square foot, with the
difference of designing

00:19:33.970 --> 00:19:34.970
it one way or the other.

00:19:34.970 --> 00:19:38.560
And this attaches itself
to your current pro forma,

00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:41.740
because it's a massive risk
reduction for the finance

00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:43.060
community.

00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:44.860
So these buildings
are all designed

00:19:44.860 --> 00:19:47.620
to be converted to
housing in the future.

00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:50.450
This is the waste treatment
system for the project right

00:19:50.450 --> 00:19:50.950
here.

00:19:50.950 --> 00:19:53.200
Turn into an asset
instead of a liability.

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:55.510
Here's a building we
did for IBM that is now

00:19:55.510 --> 00:19:56.749
being converted to housing.

00:19:56.749 --> 00:19:59.290
And the developers called us
and said, we can't believe this.

00:19:59.290 --> 00:20:01.400
We took your floor
plan and it's housing.

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:03.370
And we said, yeah, we
designed it that way.

00:20:03.370 --> 00:20:05.000
We designed the building
to be converted housing

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.210
in the future, just in case
they didn't need offices.

00:20:07.210 --> 00:20:08.350
Why wouldn't we do that?

00:20:08.350 --> 00:20:09.770
How much fun.

00:20:09.770 --> 00:20:12.940
So that's part of why we
won this award at the World

00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:15.310
Economic Forum for
being the founders

00:20:15.310 --> 00:20:17.034
of the circular economy.

00:20:17.034 --> 00:20:18.700
The circular economy
is really important

00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:22.660
as long as we see it as
a joy of perpetual assets

00:20:22.660 --> 00:20:24.170
that have benefits to society.

00:20:24.170 --> 00:20:28.150
So this is a little pavilion
I put on top of a men's store

00:20:28.150 --> 00:20:30.190
and a beauty parlor
at the entrance

00:20:30.190 --> 00:20:31.840
to the World Economic Forum.

00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:34.316
It's made from two pieces
of aluminum, A and B.

00:20:34.316 --> 00:20:35.190
There are only parts.

00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:38.750
This structure was
put up in one day.

00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:41.130
And it lives during the year
in places like Amsterdam,

00:20:41.130 --> 00:20:43.680
gets brought back up,
fits in a container.

00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:47.040
The walls are made
of a new nano gel,

00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:49.320
aero gel insulation this thick.

00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:51.080
It's equivalent
of that much foam,

00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:53.610
cradle to cradle certified.

00:20:53.610 --> 00:20:57.100
So we want good energy,
not just less bad energy.

00:20:57.100 --> 00:20:59.870
So we designed NASA's
space station on earth

00:20:59.870 --> 00:21:02.250
in Mountain View of all places.

00:21:02.250 --> 00:21:04.860
And this is the
design team we used.

00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:07.325
So we said to the people
here-- we went to Houston

00:21:07.325 --> 00:21:08.700
to the Johnson
Space Center where

00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:11.460
they heard the words,
"Houston we have a problem,"

00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:14.130
remembering too that this is
the capital of oil in America.

00:21:14.130 --> 00:21:16.440
And when Sheikh Yamani
formed OPEC, and they said,

00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:18.690
when do you think we'll see
the end of the age of oil,

00:21:18.690 --> 00:21:20.610
his answer was, I don't
know that we'll ever

00:21:20.610 --> 00:21:22.110
see the end of the
age of oil, but I

00:21:22.110 --> 00:21:24.240
do know that the
Stone Age didn't end

00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:26.730
because we ran out of stones.

00:21:26.730 --> 00:21:29.990
So if we really think
about it, these people

00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:31.490
invented the
[INAUDIBLE] so they can

00:21:31.490 --> 00:21:32.910
nuclear power a space station.

00:21:32.910 --> 00:21:34.827
Well here we are down
here in the blue planet.

00:21:34.827 --> 00:21:36.451
So instead of going
to Mars right away,

00:21:36.451 --> 00:21:37.520
let's come back to earth.

00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:38.561
This is in Mountain View.

00:21:38.561 --> 00:21:40.770
It has the potential of
making 120% of the energy it

00:21:40.770 --> 00:21:43.470
needs from renewable power
and purifying its own water.

00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:45.440
It's cradle to cradle materials.

00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:47.910
And to keep my sun shades
from disappearing during value

00:21:47.910 --> 00:21:49.590
engineering, we
put the structure

00:21:49.590 --> 00:21:52.620
on the outside of the building
as they do for wind tunnels

00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:55.140
so that if anybody tries to
get rid of our sun shades,

00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:57.570
the building falls down.

00:21:57.570 --> 00:21:59.700
Now this is an important
picture, I think.

00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:00.990
This is from the Middle East.

00:22:00.990 --> 00:22:03.210
This is Abu Dhabi and Dubai.

00:22:03.210 --> 00:22:07.560
This is 800 megawatts
of solar energy coming.

00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:11.430
What's interesting about this
is the contract for the price--

00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:14.400
2.9 cents a kilowatt hour.

00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:17.760
That's half the price of wind,
half the price of burning gas.

00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:20.400
Solar, game on, here it comes.

00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:24.100
Now these are running
north-south, not east-west.

00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:26.350
We'll get to that in a
second, and here's why.

00:22:26.350 --> 00:22:28.740
This is an experiment
going on at Davis

00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:30.120
with some friends of ours.

00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:32.760
And this is solar collectors
that rock from east

00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:35.460
to west during the
day, and it brings back

00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:38.610
all the grasses, the
agriculture, the water

00:22:38.610 --> 00:22:39.750
and the soil.

00:22:39.750 --> 00:22:40.710
It's unbelievable.

00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:42.990
The fungus starts to grow
because of the shade.

00:22:42.990 --> 00:22:45.180
And so this idea, I
think, of actually

00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:47.580
being able to do five
economic strains at once--

00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:54.990
fiber, food, water retention,
carbon sequestration,

00:22:54.990 --> 00:22:58.860
atmospheric cooling,
and solar energy,

00:22:58.860 --> 00:23:00.750
and actually the
production of clean water

00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:03.240
because we can use them as
dew collectors in the morning

00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:06.160
and then use it as focused
irrigation in the afternoon.

00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:10.597
So this is an astonishing
set of pictures, I think.

00:23:10.597 --> 00:23:12.180
So when you take
that and translate it

00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:13.480
I call it solar orchards.

00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:15.120
It's a form of silviculture.

00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:17.670
Here's a building we designed
for the Netherlands that

00:23:17.670 --> 00:23:21.900
can produce more energy than
it needs to operate and purify

00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:22.800
it's own water.

00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:27.374
And it has a budget the same
as a normal office building.

00:23:27.374 --> 00:23:28.290
So what is good water?

00:23:28.290 --> 00:23:30.190
Good water is clean
and it's available.

00:23:30.190 --> 00:23:31.620
It's a human right.

00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:34.910
So the idea is not just, can
I take out some of the lead.

00:23:34.910 --> 00:23:37.660
The idea is, every child should
have clean healthy water.

00:23:37.660 --> 00:23:39.970
So we've designed textiles
where the water coming

00:23:39.970 --> 00:23:41.700
into the factory
comes out clean--

00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:43.116
clean enough to
drink, which means

00:23:43.116 --> 00:23:44.940
you'd rather use it
again, which means

00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:47.315
you don't have any water coming
out, because all you lose

00:23:47.315 --> 00:23:48.090
is evaporation.

00:23:48.090 --> 00:23:50.190
So all of a sudden we
realized that our factories

00:23:50.190 --> 00:23:51.900
can be purification rituals.

00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:54.630
This is the world's largest
green roof, the [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:54.630 --> 00:23:56.400
for Ford Motor Company.

00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:59.340
This is, I don't know,
12, 15 years ago.

00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:01.860
And we used this to
purify all the water

00:24:01.860 --> 00:24:04.500
on the site instead of chemical
treatment plants and pipes.

00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:08.700
And it's saved $435
million day one, CAPEX.

00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:11.010
Which with the Taurus
at a 4% margin,

00:24:11.010 --> 00:24:12.960
is the equivalent of
walking into the board

00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:16.920
and giving them an order for
$900 million worth of cars.

00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:18.900
The world's largest green roof.

00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:22.740
So this is a drawing of a
factory by me as a 10-year-old.

00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:25.530
And on the left, this is what
you look at for a factory,

00:24:25.530 --> 00:24:28.270
and on the right is what we'd
like to look at for the future.

00:24:28.270 --> 00:24:31.740
So this is our factory for
Method under construction.

00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:33.450
And it's got the
largest greenhouses

00:24:33.450 --> 00:24:35.310
on a building in the world now.

00:24:35.310 --> 00:24:36.940
It's what I've been told.

00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:39.780
And it's a factory that's wind
powered and solar powered.

00:24:39.780 --> 00:24:41.640
And the great thing
about something

00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:46.330
like this-- imagine a child
in Pullman in Chicago,

00:24:46.330 --> 00:24:48.480
and when you ask them,
what is a factory, instead

00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:52.595
of drawing a thing with smoke
coming out it, they draw this.

00:24:52.595 --> 00:24:53.970
They draw things
that are growing

00:24:53.970 --> 00:24:55.080
food for their neighbor.

00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:56.370
It's a food desert there.

00:24:56.370 --> 00:24:58.180
They don't have fresh food.

00:24:58.180 --> 00:25:00.820
And so now they have
jobs making fresh food.

00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:03.240
This is part of what it
means to have a good life--

00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:05.917
safe, dignified for your kids.

00:25:05.917 --> 00:25:07.500
And we could actually
design all kinds

00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:08.833
of strange and wonderful things.

00:25:08.833 --> 00:25:10.380
This is a factory
in India we did,

00:25:10.380 --> 00:25:12.570
where we put all the structure
on the outside of the building

00:25:12.570 --> 00:25:14.620
to keep it out of the
factories so it's clean.

00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:16.020
But we can do all
these different things

00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:16.853
with this structure.

00:25:16.853 --> 00:25:18.870
We can grow food up there.

00:25:18.870 --> 00:25:20.610
We have solar
collectors up there.

00:25:20.610 --> 00:25:21.660
We have jobs up there.

00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:23.910
So you're not only in
the factory making jobs.

00:25:23.910 --> 00:25:26.910
This is our first
tomato right here.

00:25:26.910 --> 00:25:28.770
Here it is.

00:25:28.770 --> 00:25:31.620
The families can grow their
organic food here, as well as

00:25:31.620 --> 00:25:34.580
work here in the sunshine.

00:25:34.580 --> 00:25:37.240
Now this is the idea of sharing.

00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:39.720
And I just want
to show this man.

00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:40.940
His name was Venkataswamy.

00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:42.780
He died, I don't know,
five years ago now.

00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:44.840
A cataract surgeon--
but he said,

00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:47.210
why is it $1,900 to
get your eyesight back

00:25:47.210 --> 00:25:48.570
when you're 80-years-old?

00:25:48.570 --> 00:25:52.260
I can do it in 10 minutes.

00:25:52.260 --> 00:25:55.330
All I need is a cubic meter
of sterility and one scalpel.

00:25:55.330 --> 00:25:58.070
And this interocular
lens is $200.

00:25:58.070 --> 00:25:58.890
Why is it $200?

00:25:58.890 --> 00:26:00.770
We have contact lenses
that are disposal.

00:26:00.770 --> 00:26:02.840
Why is this $200 each?

00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:04.460
And we have blind people.

00:26:04.460 --> 00:26:08.180
And I can give them back
eyesight in 10 minutes.

00:26:08.180 --> 00:26:10.710
So he said, what if I
gave it away for free?

00:26:10.710 --> 00:26:13.550
I could go to scale, because
I could have my own factories.

00:26:13.550 --> 00:26:15.900
And then we'd see what it
costs for the rich people.

00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:18.620
Anyway, when he died, he'd
given eyesight to three million

00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:20.270
people for free--

00:26:20.270 --> 00:26:23.210
three million people for free.

00:26:23.210 --> 00:26:25.680
And the people who could
afford it had to pay $50.

00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:27.860
And he had seven hospitals.

00:26:27.860 --> 00:26:32.120
He built the business to
become immensely successful

00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:34.790
by collapsing the price for
those who could afford it,

00:26:34.790 --> 00:26:37.090
and everyone else
gets it for free.

00:26:37.090 --> 00:26:39.560
And because they
get it for free,

00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:41.060
the other people
could afford it.

00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:42.680
I mean, think about that.

00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:45.630
So the model becomes
a different question.

00:26:45.630 --> 00:26:50.390
We change the question of
statistical significance

00:26:50.390 --> 00:26:53.540
from, how much can I get
for how little I give,

00:26:53.540 --> 00:26:56.630
the question of modern
commerce, to how much

00:26:56.630 --> 00:27:00.050
can we give for all that we get?

00:27:00.050 --> 00:27:06.882
We move from limits and greed
to abundance and sharing.

00:27:06.882 --> 00:27:08.364
Thank you.

00:27:08.364 --> 00:27:11.822
[APPLAUSE]

00:27:17.256 --> 00:27:19.810
MARY DAVIDGE: So we're going
to have a little bit of time

00:27:19.810 --> 00:27:22.000
for questions for Bill.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:22.964
But I'm going to--

00:27:22.964 --> 00:27:24.380
while you think
of your questions,

00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:28.760
I'm going to start with a few
that I've had for some time.

00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:33.730
The first is, I know
how many decades

00:27:33.730 --> 00:27:36.400
it's taken you to achieve
many of the things

00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:38.860
that now they look
like they were easy.

00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:40.660
But I know how hard
they were in a world

00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:44.320
where no one was really
addressing these issues.

00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:45.940
How do you stay optimistic?

00:27:45.940 --> 00:27:51.790
How do you hold that long
vision that we now are all

00:27:51.790 --> 00:27:53.080
benefiting so much from?

00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:58.930
WILLIAM MCDONOUGH: It
comes back to children.

00:27:58.930 --> 00:28:03.380
In the Irish tradition,
in ancient Irish tradition

00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:06.290
there were five worlds and
the first was this one.

00:28:06.290 --> 00:28:09.885
And the second one is
called fairy, where the way

00:28:09.885 --> 00:28:12.260
they describe it it looks
exactly the same as this world,

00:28:12.260 --> 00:28:14.240
it's just a little bit better.

00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:16.420
So I try and spend as much
time there as possible,

00:28:16.420 --> 00:28:19.010
because otherwise
you get depressed.

00:28:19.010 --> 00:28:21.130
But the third world
is called Tir Na Nog,

00:28:21.130 --> 00:28:24.590
and it's the land of
the forever young.

00:28:24.590 --> 00:28:26.492
And people in this
world think that it

00:28:26.492 --> 00:28:27.950
might be nice to
be forever young--

00:28:27.950 --> 00:28:30.220
it's the Persephone myth.

00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:31.080
But it's underwater.

00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:32.270
It's in the umbrage.

00:28:32.270 --> 00:28:35.630
And the forever young
call us the immortals,

00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:38.870
because we can have
children and they can't.

00:28:38.870 --> 00:28:39.860
That's interesting.

00:28:39.860 --> 00:28:42.200
And they're waiting
for Armageddon.

00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:45.770
They're waiting for the shoe
to drop, boom, like that.

00:28:45.770 --> 00:28:49.020
So acting as if
you're forever young

00:28:49.020 --> 00:28:53.220
means you get this sort
of pathos and this fear

00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:55.530
that all of a sudden things
will end in an instant

00:28:55.530 --> 00:28:58.420
because you're forever young.

00:28:58.420 --> 00:29:00.740
And I think that
issue for me, if you

00:29:00.740 --> 00:29:03.700
look at what happened
with the nuclear bomb

00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:06.980
in the middle of
the last century,

00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:08.870
after that point people
started living as

00:29:08.870 --> 00:29:11.650
if there might be no tomorrow.

00:29:11.650 --> 00:29:15.030
So we started creating
planned obsolescence.

00:29:15.030 --> 00:29:19.380
Party up, because there
might be no world tomorrow.

00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:21.870
So what difference does it
make if you use lots of paper?

00:29:21.870 --> 00:29:24.522
The world might end in a moment.

00:29:24.522 --> 00:29:25.980
And so I think
we've started living

00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:27.063
as if there's no tomorrow.

00:29:27.063 --> 00:29:28.920
We're acting as if
we're forever young.

00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:32.400
And I think it's
starting to haunt us now,

00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:37.080
because we see both what happens
because we think that way,

00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:38.580
on a day to day basis.

00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:41.130
But also we started
doing design-- we

00:29:41.130 --> 00:29:42.600
call it design for end of life.

00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:43.980
I mean, really?

00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:46.710
Design for end of life--
if design is intention,

00:29:46.710 --> 00:29:49.211
is our intention to end life?

00:29:49.211 --> 00:29:49.710
You know?

00:29:49.710 --> 00:29:51.680
What if we are successful?

00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:52.410
Oh no.

00:29:52.410 --> 00:29:56.820
So we say design for
next use, instead of

00:29:56.820 --> 00:29:59.020
design for end of life.

00:29:59.020 --> 00:30:01.890
And once you say I'm
designing this for next use,

00:30:01.890 --> 00:30:05.230
then you don't look at
this and say, oh plastics.

00:30:05.230 --> 00:30:09.390
You go, oh, a durable
form of carbon.

00:30:09.390 --> 00:30:11.790
If I recycled that using
solar power and so on,

00:30:11.790 --> 00:30:14.280
I could use this over and over
again for many generations.

00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:18.480
This becomes an asset,
not a liability.

00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:21.230
So that's why I'm
always optimistic,

00:30:21.230 --> 00:30:25.870
because where everybody else
sees liabilities, I see assets.

00:30:25.870 --> 00:30:27.120
MARY DAVIDGE: And possibility.

00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:28.911
WILLIAM MCDONOUGH: And
possibilities, yeah.

00:30:28.911 --> 00:30:32.070
MARY DAVIDGE: Bill,
who inspires you?

00:30:32.070 --> 00:30:34.350
WILLIAM MCDONOUGH:
Other than you?

00:30:34.350 --> 00:30:36.760
MARY DAVIDGE: Who inspires you?

00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:39.110
WILLIAM MCDONOUGH: Well,
you do, that's for sure.

00:30:39.110 --> 00:30:40.860
When you look at what
you've accomplished,

00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:42.930
it's quite astonishing.

00:30:42.930 --> 00:30:46.180
My hero as a child was Gandhi.

00:30:46.180 --> 00:30:50.730
I was in Hong Kong, and
we were a British colony.

00:30:50.730 --> 00:30:53.540
And I thought the
questions he was asking

00:30:53.540 --> 00:30:56.730
were really so critical,
and in a country where

00:30:56.730 --> 00:31:02.340
soil is the source
of all the relations.

00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:04.950
And when I became an architect--
and one of my first projects

00:31:04.950 --> 00:31:12.300
was to look if I could design
a Hindu temple for a Hindu

00:31:12.300 --> 00:31:13.830
community.

00:31:13.830 --> 00:31:16.890
So I went to India for six
weeks and had a begging bowl

00:31:16.890 --> 00:31:21.730
and lived with a Hindu
community as a beggar.

00:31:21.730 --> 00:31:26.904
And I studied the shastras for
the design of Hindu temples

00:31:26.904 --> 00:31:29.070
and realized it was just
something I could never do,

00:31:29.070 --> 00:31:31.890
because you need to be inured
so deeply in the culture to do

00:31:31.890 --> 00:31:35.110
something that was meaningful.

00:31:35.110 --> 00:31:37.359
But the part that
really struck me

00:31:37.359 --> 00:31:39.150
was that in order to
build the Hindu temple

00:31:39.150 --> 00:31:42.240
you had to take,
usually a rocky spot,

00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:43.800
and then you had to
bring it to life.

00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:47.030
You had a three year protocol
to create fecundity there.

00:31:47.030 --> 00:31:51.220
You had to make it healthy
and full of food and benefit--

00:31:51.220 --> 00:31:52.140
flowers.

00:31:52.140 --> 00:31:53.370
It was amazing.

00:31:53.370 --> 00:31:54.910
It's a very prescribed process.

00:31:54.910 --> 00:31:57.060
And then you give the
soil that you just

00:31:57.060 --> 00:32:02.890
made from the sun and the rocks
and the air and the water,

00:32:02.890 --> 00:32:05.820
fecundity, growth,
and then you give that

00:32:05.820 --> 00:32:09.549
to the farmers around
it and build the temple.

00:32:09.549 --> 00:32:11.673
The temple has to be built
on a place that's alive.

00:32:11.673 --> 00:32:13.770
Isn't that beautiful?

00:32:13.770 --> 00:32:17.840
So I found that to be something
I like to do as a ritual.

00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:19.800
I think it's an important idea.

00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:21.990
And when I was at the
Museum of Natural History

00:32:21.990 --> 00:32:25.080
here, in the rotunda on
the way into the Hall

00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:28.110
of the African peoples
they have this quote.

00:32:28.110 --> 00:32:31.720
And I looked it up
online later saying, wow,

00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:34.335
who's Galla It was
attributed to Galla.

00:32:34.335 --> 00:32:36.360
I said, is this
some kind of Latin?

00:32:36.360 --> 00:32:37.170
What is this?

00:32:37.170 --> 00:32:42.720
And Galla was a subtribe
of the Oromo in Ethiopia.

00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:44.490
And the poem which
they then state

00:32:44.490 --> 00:32:47.830
is like, nobody knows
what this means.

00:32:47.830 --> 00:32:50.450
Here's the poem.

00:32:50.450 --> 00:32:52.770
"One is born.

00:32:52.770 --> 00:32:54.870
One dies.

00:32:54.870 --> 00:32:57.423
The land increases."

00:32:57.423 --> 00:32:58.836
That's the poem.

00:33:01.591 --> 00:33:02.340
What does it mean?

00:33:04.850 --> 00:33:07.970
The world gets better
because we're here.

00:33:07.970 --> 00:33:10.110
Biology.

00:33:10.110 --> 00:33:11.690
One is born, one dies.

00:33:11.690 --> 00:33:13.200
It's the soil increases.

00:33:16.650 --> 00:33:19.265
So that's why I'm optimistic.

00:33:19.265 --> 00:33:20.390
MARY DAVIDGE: That's great.

00:33:20.390 --> 00:33:23.450
So I have one more, and then
anyone who wants-- oh, we've

00:33:23.450 --> 00:33:24.320
got a question here.

00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:24.820
OK.

00:33:24.820 --> 00:33:25.900
I'll hold mine.

00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:27.100
Yes.

00:33:27.100 --> 00:33:28.060
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:33:28.060 --> 00:33:32.870
A question-- I wonder
what are your thoughts

00:33:32.870 --> 00:33:37.760
about the main
obstacles from using

00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:40.420
the new energy like
solar, nuclear,

00:33:40.420 --> 00:33:45.340
wind from being our
main source of power?

00:33:45.340 --> 00:33:49.534
Is there anything stopping--
or what can we do?

00:33:49.534 --> 00:33:51.450
WILLIAM MCDONOUGH: Let
me repeat the question.

00:33:54.070 --> 00:33:55.850
If I get it wrong, let me know.

00:33:55.850 --> 00:34:01.410
It's, what is the main obstacle
between us using solar, wind,

00:34:01.410 --> 00:34:04.620
and other forms of clean power
from the conventional practice

00:34:04.620 --> 00:34:06.150
we have now.

00:34:06.150 --> 00:34:09.550
I think it's very
straightforward really.

00:34:09.550 --> 00:34:12.870
It's the incumbency
of existing actors.

00:34:12.870 --> 00:34:14.976
People become
positionally conservative,

00:34:14.976 --> 00:34:16.350
because that's
what they're doing

00:34:16.350 --> 00:34:18.016
and that's what they
want to keep doing,

00:34:18.016 --> 00:34:20.370
so they protect it at all costs.

00:34:20.370 --> 00:34:23.010
So that's what
you're up against.

00:34:23.010 --> 00:34:25.320
What you're coming
in with, which

00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:33.530
are what I would call them the
tools of waging peace, are--

00:34:33.530 --> 00:34:36.449
we have the things that
don't require regulation,

00:34:36.449 --> 00:34:39.389
because typically these
are relatively safe.

00:34:39.389 --> 00:34:40.949
In the case of
solar and wind they

00:34:40.949 --> 00:34:42.429
provide an immense
number of jobs.

00:34:42.429 --> 00:34:44.940
So we can argue
that one, for sure.

00:34:44.940 --> 00:34:47.760
And the price has collapsed
in the case of solar

00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:50.290
because the commoditization
of solar collectors, which

00:34:50.290 --> 00:34:52.989
have had a bit of a
rough and tumble road

00:34:52.989 --> 00:34:58.215
with a dramatic moment with
the Chinese dumping solar

00:34:58.215 --> 00:34:58.840
into the world.

00:34:58.840 --> 00:35:00.420
So it's caused a bit of a shock.

00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:03.000
But it's all part
of the collapse

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:04.990
of the cost of these things.

00:35:04.990 --> 00:35:06.960
So in the end, I
think the economics

00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:08.760
are going to be the key driver.

00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:11.490
So when President Trump
says we want to bring back

00:35:11.490 --> 00:35:15.570
all the jobs in coal, the
language might want to be,

00:35:15.570 --> 00:35:18.687
and as I think it will play
out, when you look at the coal

00:35:18.687 --> 00:35:21.270
companies and some of the other
facilities they're developing,

00:35:21.270 --> 00:35:23.550
even in West Virginia,
it's interesting to note

00:35:23.550 --> 00:35:28.210
they're solar-powered
because it's cost effective.

00:35:28.210 --> 00:35:30.360
And when you think about
it it's quite astonishing.

00:35:30.360 --> 00:35:33.945
We're seeing solar energy in
West Virginia at about 4.7

00:35:33.945 --> 00:35:35.550
cents a kilowatt hour.

00:35:35.550 --> 00:35:38.610
Well that's the same price as
buying coal-fired electricity.

00:35:38.610 --> 00:35:40.800
So the economics are coming.

00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:42.570
And I think it's really
the job creation.

00:35:42.570 --> 00:35:44.820
Because there's going to be
a lot more jobs putting up

00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:46.770
solar collections
in West Virginia

00:35:46.770 --> 00:35:51.210
than having big equipment
and tear off mountaintops.

00:35:51.210 --> 00:35:54.562
AUDIENCE: It's economic
coming only recently?

00:35:54.562 --> 00:35:55.520
WILLIAM MCDONOUGH: Yes.

00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:59.090
It's quite recent in the
big picture of things.

00:35:59.090 --> 00:36:01.340
It's been within
the last five years

00:36:01.340 --> 00:36:03.800
that we've seen
the tipping point.

00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:05.740
But we still have to look at--

00:36:05.740 --> 00:36:07.610
we're at a point
now if they just

00:36:07.610 --> 00:36:12.370
stripped subsidies of all kinds
off of every source of energy,

00:36:12.370 --> 00:36:15.570
the renewables would
just take over.

00:36:15.570 --> 00:36:18.600
So this idea of
saying we're not going

00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:20.310
to get subsidies
to solar because we

00:36:20.310 --> 00:36:21.700
want to bring back the coal--

00:36:21.700 --> 00:36:22.651
coal is subsidized.

00:36:22.651 --> 00:36:23.400
Oil is subsidized.

00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:25.380
They're all subsidized
one way of the other,

00:36:25.380 --> 00:36:26.972
tax credits or otherwise.

00:36:26.972 --> 00:36:28.680
And if you just strip
it all off and say,

00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:30.221
we're going to be
economic creatures,

00:36:30.221 --> 00:36:32.700
let's go get the
right stuff done--

00:36:32.700 --> 00:36:34.650
and if you add the
cost of regulation,

00:36:34.650 --> 00:36:36.775
and you add the cost
of cleaning up things,

00:36:36.775 --> 00:36:41.010
or you add the perpetual
liabilities we create,

00:36:41.010 --> 00:36:43.290
renewables are going
to win hands down.

00:36:43.290 --> 00:36:46.311
So I think we keep pushing.

00:36:46.311 --> 00:36:47.310
MARY DAVIDGE: Thank you.

00:36:47.310 --> 00:36:47.809
Yes.

00:36:50.839 --> 00:36:51.880
AUDIENCE: Does this work?

00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:52.706
OK.

00:36:52.706 --> 00:36:53.830
So first of all, thank you.

00:36:53.830 --> 00:36:55.930
This is really inspiring.

00:36:55.930 --> 00:37:03.160
I mean, just refreshing to
see this way of thought,

00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:08.740
even for someone that's
very into ecological causes

00:37:08.740 --> 00:37:12.520
and recycling and all that,
to embed all that into design

00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:16.110
thinking is very refreshing
and very inspiring.

00:37:16.110 --> 00:37:19.210
I have actually a follow up
question to what you just

00:37:19.210 --> 00:37:20.360
discussed.

00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:26.650
I tend to agree that
our biggest barriers are

00:37:26.650 --> 00:37:28.660
conventional thinking
and doing things the way

00:37:28.660 --> 00:37:29.740
we've always done them.

00:37:29.740 --> 00:37:33.610
And we've developed quite a
culture and quite an economy

00:37:33.610 --> 00:37:37.870
based on scarcity and greed, and
it's hard to change from that.

00:37:37.870 --> 00:37:42.190
And I for one don't have
a lot of hope for adults,

00:37:42.190 --> 00:37:45.730
but I do have a lot
of hope for children.

00:37:45.730 --> 00:37:49.780
And I want to touch on
what you just talked about.

00:37:49.780 --> 00:37:52.300
Economics are a great
driver, probably the best

00:37:52.300 --> 00:37:55.540
driver for stuff, at least
in our capitalist culture,

00:37:55.540 --> 00:37:56.860
for sure.

00:37:56.860 --> 00:38:00.880
There are some things
though that are probably

00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:04.060
best not left to economics.

00:38:04.060 --> 00:38:07.780
Just to give one example,
everybody recycles a glass here

00:38:07.780 --> 00:38:09.340
I imagine.

00:38:09.340 --> 00:38:12.020
It's been very big for
the last few decades.

00:38:12.020 --> 00:38:15.790
But really nowadays glass
recycling is not economical.

00:38:15.790 --> 00:38:19.670
In fact, some
localities in the states

00:38:19.670 --> 00:38:21.970
stopped recycling
glass because it just

00:38:21.970 --> 00:38:26.530
cost too much to transport it
and it's easier and cheaper

00:38:26.530 --> 00:38:27.832
to manufacture.

00:38:27.832 --> 00:38:30.040
So here the economics are
kind of upside down, right.

00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:32.170
They're driving us to
do the wrong thing.

00:38:35.650 --> 00:38:38.330
So this is where I think
the only chance we have

00:38:38.330 --> 00:38:40.770
is to change the way we think.

00:38:40.770 --> 00:38:47.090
And do you, and how
do you see integrating

00:38:47.090 --> 00:38:51.750
this wonderful way of thinking
into educational programs

00:38:51.750 --> 00:38:53.520
so that the next
generation will make

00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:59.094
all the right choices regardless
of the economic incentives?

00:38:59.094 --> 00:39:00.510
WILLIAM MCDONOUGH:
Great question.

00:39:03.856 --> 00:39:06.575
I think that if you design
it for 10-year-olds--

00:39:06.575 --> 00:39:08.600
see 10-year-olds
look at this stuff

00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:12.471
and consider what I'm
talking about to be obvious.

00:39:12.471 --> 00:39:13.470
That's really important.

00:39:13.470 --> 00:39:15.470
When I heard the other
day that cradle to cradle

00:39:15.470 --> 00:39:18.390
is now used in a very
famous English university

00:39:18.390 --> 00:39:21.197
in the course on rhetoric
in the English department,

00:39:21.197 --> 00:39:23.780
I heard they're a little grumpy
it was written by an American.

00:39:23.780 --> 00:39:27.960
But it's how to make an
argument in the English language

00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:30.150
so that when you finish
reading it, you say,

00:39:30.150 --> 00:39:31.852
well that was obvious.

00:39:31.852 --> 00:39:33.810
And then you think back
and before you read it,

00:39:33.810 --> 00:39:34.680
it wasn't at all.

00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:36.510
So what is that?

00:39:36.510 --> 00:39:39.100
And I think we've reached
that point of the obvious.

00:39:39.100 --> 00:39:42.120
Now, when you think of glass,
for example, in the recycling,

00:39:42.120 --> 00:39:43.170
you're absolutely right.

00:39:43.170 --> 00:39:47.820
We can still sell clear
cullet at a material recovery

00:39:47.820 --> 00:39:49.080
facility in the United States.

00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:53.160
Clear glass is still
economically recyclable.

00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:56.740
But the colored glass, which is
most of it, is not, et cetera.

00:39:56.740 --> 00:39:58.327
So there's mountains
of it around.

00:39:58.327 --> 00:39:59.910
So one of the things
to do immediately

00:39:59.910 --> 00:40:01.800
on that is to say,
what can we use it for,

00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:06.439
for example while we
transition from glass or are

00:40:06.439 --> 00:40:07.230
continue to use it.

00:40:07.230 --> 00:40:10.860
It's quite a lovely material
and quite optimized actually,

00:40:10.860 --> 00:40:12.000
in many respects.

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:14.080
It's, we could be
making things with it.

00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:18.180
So I think we can have local
manufacturers in places

00:40:18.180 --> 00:40:20.360
making kitchen counters out
of it, whatever we want.

00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:23.380
There's plenty of things to
do with glass as an aggregate.

00:40:23.380 --> 00:40:26.280
So start to think of it as a
resource rather than a waste

00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:27.710
and then see what happens.

00:40:27.710 --> 00:40:30.210
Don't just say, I have to melt
it and turn into glass again.

00:40:30.210 --> 00:40:31.626
You can turn it
into other things.

00:40:31.626 --> 00:40:34.560
So that's one kind of element.

00:40:34.560 --> 00:40:36.990
The other is as we look
at these materials--

00:40:36.990 --> 00:40:39.450
I wrote an essay for the
science journal, Nature

00:40:39.450 --> 00:40:42.390
that they entitled,
"Carbon is not the Enemy,"

00:40:42.390 --> 00:40:46.050
and I was calling it a
new language for carbon.

00:40:46.050 --> 00:40:47.844
And the thing that
made me so sad--

00:40:47.844 --> 00:40:49.260
and this brings
us to the children

00:40:49.260 --> 00:40:50.640
who see this as obvious--

00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:54.690
is that at the TED Conference,
which is going on now--

00:40:54.690 --> 00:40:58.350
last year the prime minister
of Bhutan got up and said,

00:40:58.350 --> 00:41:01.140
we're going to be a
carbon-negative country,

00:41:01.140 --> 00:41:03.760
and that's good.

00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:07.050
And it broke my heart because
to be a carbon-negative country

00:41:07.050 --> 00:41:11.320
being a good, that means carbon
itself must be a negative.

00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:14.010
So you have a double negative
making it good, right?

00:41:14.010 --> 00:41:17.820
The problem is, less
and bad are not numbers.

00:41:17.820 --> 00:41:19.990
Less is a relationship
of numbers.

00:41:19.990 --> 00:41:21.300
Bad is human value.

00:41:21.300 --> 00:41:24.870
So you can't multiply less and
bad and get a positive result.

00:41:24.870 --> 00:41:27.240
It's bad by definition,
just less so.

00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:30.090
So the idea of
carbon-negative as a positive

00:41:30.090 --> 00:41:33.240
broke my heart, because
carbon is source of life.

00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:35.680
So really it's the
human behavior.

00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:37.230
So this new language--

00:41:37.230 --> 00:41:39.960
I basically said, what if
we treat carbon emissions

00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:42.300
in the atmosphere
today as a toxin,

00:41:42.300 --> 00:41:45.390
and then we call that
carbon negative behavior,

00:41:45.390 --> 00:41:47.640
and let's call the
carbon fugitive.

00:41:47.640 --> 00:41:50.340
Because the value of
a tool is put there

00:41:50.340 --> 00:41:54.180
by the user, and the
intention of the user.

00:41:54.180 --> 00:41:56.550
So a hammer in the
hands of a child

00:41:56.550 --> 00:41:59.740
is a toy, in the hands of
a carpenter is your house,

00:41:59.740 --> 00:42:03.570
and in the hands of a
maniac it's a weapon.

00:42:03.570 --> 00:42:05.640
So the hammer is innocent.

00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:06.870
So is carbon.

00:42:06.870 --> 00:42:10.710
So carbon, unnatural
carbon in the atmosphere,

00:42:10.710 --> 00:42:13.110
not good-- fugitive carbon.

00:42:13.110 --> 00:42:14.550
Then in the middle
of it all would

00:42:14.550 --> 00:42:16.500
be durable carbon--
a limestone mountain

00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:19.740
sitting calmly,
or plastics, which

00:42:19.740 --> 00:42:23.370
are carbon that are being
recycled across generations

00:42:23.370 --> 00:42:24.880
over and over again.

00:42:24.880 --> 00:42:26.860
That's a durable form of carbon.

00:42:26.860 --> 00:42:28.470
So we call that durable carbon.

00:42:28.470 --> 00:42:31.040
If we burn it for energy--

00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:33.840
fugitive, oops, nightmare,
carbon in the atmosphere.

00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:36.579
So do not call this
waste energy thing

00:42:36.579 --> 00:42:39.120
renewable power, which we do in
the United States by the way.

00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:41.280
The EPA characterizes
waste energy

00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:44.730
as renewable power,
which is insane.

00:42:44.730 --> 00:42:49.650
Then this ends up in
the oceans, and we now

00:42:49.650 --> 00:42:54.150
hear that by 2050 the amount
of plastic in the ocean

00:42:54.150 --> 00:42:55.645
will be equal to that of fish.

00:42:58.200 --> 00:43:00.780
How are we doing on statistical
significance, right?

00:43:00.780 --> 00:43:04.170
So that is durable
carbon getting fugitive

00:43:04.170 --> 00:43:05.380
into the ocean.

00:43:05.380 --> 00:43:07.109
Oops, right?

00:43:07.109 --> 00:43:09.150
So I'm working on a project
to try and figure out

00:43:09.150 --> 00:43:11.250
how we stop that flow.

00:43:11.250 --> 00:43:16.500
Then if you have carbon in
soil, you have living carbon.

00:43:16.500 --> 00:43:20.930
So fugitive carbon, durable
carbon, living carbon--

00:43:20.930 --> 00:43:24.660
and living carbon accrues more
carbon from the atmosphere.

00:43:24.660 --> 00:43:26.160
And so we can start
designing things

00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:31.800
that send carbon back to
soil, even polymers like this.

00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:35.060
And we can even design
these polymers to biodegrade

00:43:35.060 --> 00:43:37.620
and compost into soil.

00:43:37.620 --> 00:43:40.920
Because I see this
oil as ancient soil,

00:43:40.920 --> 00:43:42.410
they just added an s.

00:43:42.410 --> 00:43:42.910
Right.

00:43:42.910 --> 00:43:44.620
Add the "s" and go to soil.

00:43:44.620 --> 00:43:47.730
So put the "s" back so
we can use various things

00:43:47.730 --> 00:43:50.454
like [INAUDIBLE] and open
up the polymer chains

00:43:50.454 --> 00:43:51.870
and design these
things to go back

00:43:51.870 --> 00:43:54.810
to carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen,
and build soil with them too.

00:43:54.810 --> 00:43:57.760
So that whole thing
is a design system.

00:43:57.760 --> 00:44:00.954
So that's a long answer to
what to do about the glass.

00:44:00.954 --> 00:44:03.120
MARY DAVIDGE: It's a funny
thing that you brought up

00:44:03.120 --> 00:44:03.960
that question.

00:44:03.960 --> 00:44:05.876
Interesting that you
brought up that question.

00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:10.350
Sometimes it's thinking
beyond the problem.

00:44:10.350 --> 00:44:12.150
In our construction
projects we're

00:44:12.150 --> 00:44:16.260
now looking at using
local recycled glass

00:44:16.260 --> 00:44:21.360
as a [INAUDIBLE], as an
ingredient in concrete

00:44:21.360 --> 00:44:25.830
to replace [INAUDIBLE], which
is a derivative of coal.

00:44:25.830 --> 00:44:28.590
So I think sometimes you
notice these problems,

00:44:28.590 --> 00:44:33.270
and then in the circular
economy you can think beyond it

00:44:33.270 --> 00:44:36.106
and solve two problems really.

00:44:36.106 --> 00:44:38.790
AUDIENCE: I'm sorry, just
a quick, quick follow up.

00:44:38.790 --> 00:44:42.110
I guess what ultimately I'm--

00:44:42.110 --> 00:44:44.870
you have your
wonderful book here.

00:44:44.870 --> 00:44:47.450
I want the children's version.

00:44:47.450 --> 00:44:48.680
WILLIAM MCDONOUGH: Yeah.

00:44:48.680 --> 00:44:49.130
AUDIENCE: I want--

00:44:49.130 --> 00:44:50.213
WILLIAM MCDONOUGH: I know.

00:44:50.213 --> 00:44:51.570
I get asked that every week.

00:44:51.570 --> 00:44:54.380
AUDIENCE: That the
next generation is less

00:44:54.380 --> 00:44:58.640
influenced by our old
and outdated conventions

00:44:58.640 --> 00:45:02.690
and our cynicism and
our greed and scarcity,

00:45:02.690 --> 00:45:04.580
and inspired to do this.

00:45:04.580 --> 00:45:06.320
WILLIAM MCDONOUGH:
I think that's why--

00:45:06.320 --> 00:45:08.040
I created the five
goods because we

00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:11.400
were working on a fashion center
in Amsterdam for a fashion

00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:13.910
initiative for the world
to take on fast action

00:45:13.910 --> 00:45:17.185
with this concepts of
cradle to cradle and cradle

00:45:17.185 --> 00:45:18.020
to cradle certified.

00:45:18.020 --> 00:45:20.350
So I called it the
five goods so that it

00:45:20.350 --> 00:45:21.920
could be just a
free set of terms

00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:24.400
that are basic to
everyone on the planet.

00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:25.350
This is good.

00:45:25.350 --> 00:45:25.850
That's bad.

00:45:25.850 --> 00:45:26.990
That kind of thing.

00:45:26.990 --> 00:45:31.820
So that the five goods is the
title of my children's book

00:45:31.820 --> 00:45:32.865
to come.

00:45:32.865 --> 00:45:34.490
MARY DAVIDGE: That's
such a great idea.

00:45:34.490 --> 00:45:36.460
OK, this side of the room.

00:45:36.460 --> 00:45:37.994
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:45:37.994 --> 00:45:39.800
I had two questions,
but I'm going

00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:42.320
to decide to take the good
question rather than the less

00:45:42.320 --> 00:45:43.340
bad question.

00:45:43.340 --> 00:45:44.300
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:45.740 --> 00:45:48.200
And it's pretty
open-ended, I think.

00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:50.540
I was really inspired by
your work-- great stuff.

00:45:50.540 --> 00:45:52.910
I'm glad I came and
thanks for sharing.

00:45:52.910 --> 00:45:56.600
And I think it'd be great to
hear some ways that we could

00:45:56.600 --> 00:45:58.610
kind of translate
that to our own lives

00:45:58.610 --> 00:46:01.500
as someone who's not
always thinking about it,

00:46:01.500 --> 00:46:03.680
but any time I do
I'm inspired by it

00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:07.460
and I want to be involved
and contribute in some way.

00:46:07.460 --> 00:46:10.700
So do you have any
suggestions or mantras or ways

00:46:10.700 --> 00:46:14.810
to get involved that you think,
kind of like the layman, could

00:46:14.810 --> 00:46:18.129
contribute to that
the circular society?

00:46:18.129 --> 00:46:19.170
WILLIAM MCDONOUGH: Right.

00:46:19.170 --> 00:46:20.610
It's a great question.

00:46:20.610 --> 00:46:22.910
How do we do it in
our daily lives?

00:46:22.910 --> 00:46:25.910
I think, for me, one
of the great joys

00:46:25.910 --> 00:46:28.400
is contemplating the garden.

00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:33.020
Think about the machine
in the garden, right.

00:46:33.020 --> 00:46:36.770
And you're living in the garden.

00:46:36.770 --> 00:46:38.799
So do that.

00:46:38.799 --> 00:46:39.590
Live in the garden.

00:46:39.590 --> 00:46:45.720
So think about, like, grow
food, heal soil, compost--

00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:49.380
all those basic actions that
connect you back to the soil.

00:46:49.380 --> 00:46:50.730
Walk barefoot.

00:46:50.730 --> 00:46:53.040
Take trips to places where
you can't use your phone

00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:55.620
because you feel stupid.

00:46:55.620 --> 00:46:58.340
Where you have to look at
the bubbling stream, and say,

00:46:58.340 --> 00:46:59.340
I can't talk on a phone.

00:46:59.340 --> 00:47:01.129
I have this bubbling
stream here.

00:47:01.129 --> 00:47:01.920
It's too beautiful.

00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:03.240
That kind of thing.

00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:06.060
Go out in the natural
world as much as you can.

00:47:06.060 --> 00:47:08.230
Celebrate your presence there.

00:47:08.230 --> 00:47:10.920
And that is part of, I
think, of the healing

00:47:10.920 --> 00:47:12.210
that goes on with us.

00:47:12.210 --> 00:47:17.850
Because even if you look at the
notion of our daily activities,

00:47:17.850 --> 00:47:21.690
there's this notion of sort
of the platonic purity of,

00:47:21.690 --> 00:47:25.350
the joy of beauty and truth
and the human imagination

00:47:25.350 --> 00:47:28.440
and with creativity,
an experience.

00:47:28.440 --> 00:47:31.080
That's really important.

00:47:31.080 --> 00:47:32.820
And I'm sure you
celebrate that every day

00:47:32.820 --> 00:47:35.550
when you have revelations
in your work and so on.

00:47:35.550 --> 00:47:38.790
Then there's this issue of how
do you act on wisdom, which

00:47:38.790 --> 00:47:40.740
is the Aristotelian question.

00:47:40.740 --> 00:47:44.670
If you know this beauty,
then how do you behave?

00:47:44.670 --> 00:47:46.470
What do you do?

00:47:46.470 --> 00:47:49.170
So it's essentially, how
do you get from your values

00:47:49.170 --> 00:47:51.844
to value creation every day?

00:47:51.844 --> 00:47:53.760
So if you live in the
world of value creation,

00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:57.450
like just money and number,
you can pound your way up

00:47:57.450 --> 00:48:01.350
through tactics and
strategies to goals,

00:48:01.350 --> 00:48:04.620
but you can't get to your values
of what's right and wrong.

00:48:04.620 --> 00:48:05.994
You're in the world number, see.

00:48:05.994 --> 00:48:08.160
But if you start with your
values, what do you think

00:48:08.160 --> 00:48:09.120
is right and wrong?

00:48:09.120 --> 00:48:12.570
Live that, then develop a set
of principles to behave by that

00:48:12.570 --> 00:48:13.350
don't move.

00:48:13.350 --> 00:48:14.210
That's why I wrote
something called

00:48:14.210 --> 00:48:15.668
the, "Hannover
Principles," for us.

00:48:15.668 --> 00:48:17.920
These are design principles--
things that don't move.

00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:23.100
Respect the relationship
between spirit and matter.

00:48:23.100 --> 00:48:26.640
Insist on the rights of
humanity and nature to co-exist.

00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:30.690
Eliminate the concept of waste.

00:48:30.690 --> 00:48:32.820
Respect the limitations
of human design.

00:48:32.820 --> 00:48:34.410
Be humble.

00:48:34.410 --> 00:48:37.080
If anybody has trouble with
humility, just know this,

00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:40.950
it took us 5,000 years to
put wheels on our luggage.

00:48:40.950 --> 00:48:43.860
We went to the moon before
we had wheels on our luggage.

00:48:43.860 --> 00:48:45.600
So we're not that smart.

00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:48.780
It took another 20 years to
put four wheels on our luggage.

00:48:48.780 --> 00:48:50.480
But, you know, we're moving.

00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:52.990
But have some humility here.

00:48:52.990 --> 00:48:56.250
Then you go to design
and you have visions.

00:48:56.250 --> 00:48:59.150
And we know that without
execution, visions

00:48:59.150 --> 00:49:00.840
are hallucinations.

00:49:00.840 --> 00:49:01.920
I live there.

00:49:01.920 --> 00:49:03.650
That's I do visions.

00:49:03.650 --> 00:49:06.100
I do that professionally.

00:49:06.100 --> 00:49:10.432
But I know that if they don't
get executed, they're not real.

00:49:10.432 --> 00:49:11.640
So then you go to your goals.

00:49:11.640 --> 00:49:12.990
Then you do your strategies.

00:49:12.990 --> 00:49:14.310
Then you do your tactics.

00:49:14.310 --> 00:49:16.230
Then you do the metrics.

00:49:16.230 --> 00:49:18.150
Then you show the value.

00:49:18.150 --> 00:49:20.190
Show the value last.

00:49:20.190 --> 00:49:22.570
Show your values first.

00:49:22.570 --> 00:49:24.340
Because as Peter
Drucker pointed out,

00:49:24.340 --> 00:49:27.720
it's a manager's job to be
efficient and do something

00:49:27.720 --> 00:49:31.350
the right way, but
it's the executives job

00:49:31.350 --> 00:49:34.530
to do the right thing.

00:49:34.530 --> 00:49:37.994
Because if you're in
the wrong business,

00:49:37.994 --> 00:49:39.660
it doesn't matter how
efficient you are.

00:49:39.660 --> 00:49:42.900
If you use Six Sigma
statistical perfection,

00:49:42.900 --> 00:49:47.100
while you do the wrong thing,
you become perfectly wrong.

00:49:47.100 --> 00:49:51.380
So as a person, just try
to live with your values,

00:49:51.380 --> 00:49:53.160
and then exercise
them every day.

00:49:53.160 --> 00:49:56.900
And if you grow safe
healthy food for yourself,

00:49:56.900 --> 00:49:58.130
just try that.

00:49:58.130 --> 00:49:59.000
Watch what happens.

00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:00.580
Because you're doing
the right thing.

00:50:00.580 --> 00:50:02.330
And then you get all
caught up in doing it

00:50:02.330 --> 00:50:04.640
the right way, which is fun.

00:50:04.640 --> 00:50:09.010
Because it's a curious thing
to do, watch things grow.

00:50:09.010 --> 00:50:09.844
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:50:09.844 --> 00:50:11.426
MARY DAVIDGE: One
more quick question.

00:50:11.426 --> 00:50:11.926
Emily.

00:50:11.926 --> 00:50:12.551
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:50:12.551 --> 00:50:14.470
I think my question's
changed like 35 times

00:50:14.470 --> 00:50:16.044
since I've been standing here.

00:50:16.044 --> 00:50:18.460
I do sustainability here for
those of you that don't know.

00:50:18.460 --> 00:50:22.480
And waste initiative is
kind of our focus this year.

00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:25.480
So you talk a lot
about getting people

00:50:25.480 --> 00:50:28.089
to go back to their
values and really it's

00:50:28.089 --> 00:50:29.630
everybody that has
to think about it.

00:50:29.630 --> 00:50:33.160
So one of the things that we
did for Earth Week was set up

00:50:33.160 --> 00:50:36.250
a recyclables display that
I think you might have seen.

00:50:36.250 --> 00:50:38.130
Did you see it, anybody?

00:50:38.130 --> 00:50:38.980
The Commons?

00:50:38.980 --> 00:50:39.620
No?

00:50:39.620 --> 00:50:41.770
See, we did not
publicize that enough.

00:50:41.770 --> 00:50:45.400
But it was a massive container
that shows two separations.

00:50:45.400 --> 00:50:47.500
So one of them was clean
recyclables-- glass,

00:50:47.500 --> 00:50:49.780
metal, plastic that can
be recycled, and the other

00:50:49.780 --> 00:50:50.650
is dirty.

00:50:50.650 --> 00:50:54.086
So within this
stream, at this point

00:50:54.086 --> 00:50:56.710
we're working within the system
that we have in New York which,

00:50:56.710 --> 00:50:58.320
if it's not clean, it
doesn't get recycled,

00:50:58.320 --> 00:50:59.278
it ends up in landfill.

00:50:59.278 --> 00:51:00.910
We have incineration.

00:51:00.910 --> 00:51:02.440
It's terrible.

00:51:02.440 --> 00:51:05.920
So trying to educate
people, especially

00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:09.670
in a city that moves so fast
and is so based on disposable--

00:51:09.670 --> 00:51:14.020
how do you try to bring
that to people's attention?

00:51:14.020 --> 00:51:17.440
I mean, I've tried in, obviously
gloom and doom kind of ways,

00:51:17.440 --> 00:51:20.170
like look at how
much waste there is.

00:51:20.170 --> 00:51:22.450
Drop the Box campaign,
so that people

00:51:22.450 --> 00:51:25.060
use a plate instead of a
disposable-- those kinds

00:51:25.060 --> 00:51:25.970
of things.

00:51:25.970 --> 00:51:29.504
And it seems to be something
that people care about when

00:51:29.504 --> 00:51:30.670
you talk to them one on one.

00:51:30.670 --> 00:51:35.290
But in masses it's difficult
to get it to catch on.

00:51:35.290 --> 00:51:39.589
So how do you suggest that
we get more people involved

00:51:39.589 --> 00:51:40.630
in those kinds of things?

00:51:43.420 --> 00:51:46.510
WILLIAM MCDONOUGH: It is
one of the great questions.

00:51:46.510 --> 00:51:51.070
I was saddened to hear
recently that the tourists who

00:51:51.070 --> 00:51:56.320
went to Bali to see some
exquisite tropical place

00:51:56.320 --> 00:52:00.160
with a culture that
was gracious and gentle

00:52:00.160 --> 00:52:04.570
are not going now because the
beaches are covered in plastic.

00:52:04.570 --> 00:52:07.300
And if you look at
the history of Bali,

00:52:07.300 --> 00:52:13.100
it's only been one generation
from when they used leaves

00:52:13.100 --> 00:52:17.450
for plates, and they
ate with their hands.

00:52:17.450 --> 00:52:19.697
So it used to be you went
there and you got a plate,

00:52:19.697 --> 00:52:21.530
and when you're finished
with the plate it's

00:52:21.530 --> 00:52:23.330
what we call soil compostable.

00:52:23.330 --> 00:52:25.490
It was like ba.

00:52:25.490 --> 00:52:29.862
So a world where
littering is fun,

00:52:29.862 --> 00:52:31.070
and it goes back to the soil.

00:52:31.070 --> 00:52:32.280
Oh my goodness.

00:52:32.280 --> 00:52:34.820
So I think we should
learn from that.

00:52:34.820 --> 00:52:37.490
And if we can start to imagine
that all of this detritus

00:52:37.490 --> 00:52:41.720
we have becomes
exquisitely designed

00:52:41.720 --> 00:52:45.110
to go back to cycles so people
can go on with their lives,

00:52:45.110 --> 00:52:47.530
and littering is fun.

00:52:47.530 --> 00:52:50.450
See right now I'm looking
at these giant projects

00:52:50.450 --> 00:52:53.390
for how to do road maps for
packaging as well as designing

00:52:53.390 --> 00:52:55.070
buildings and products.

00:52:55.070 --> 00:52:58.190
And part of what I'm trying
to figure out how to do

00:52:58.190 --> 00:53:00.420
is make it fun.

00:53:00.420 --> 00:53:04.400
So please litter
becomes like, huh?

00:53:04.400 --> 00:53:08.800
So right now I'm working
on e-commerce packaging

00:53:08.800 --> 00:53:13.489
that is all based on soil health
and just for the fun of it.

00:53:13.489 --> 00:53:15.530
So that getting e-commerce,
instead of it as some

00:53:15.530 --> 00:53:19.820
terrifying hybridization
of strange packaging--

00:53:19.820 --> 00:53:21.850
I don't know what you've seen.

00:53:21.850 --> 00:53:25.340
But you get boxes this big
with little things and bubbles

00:53:25.340 --> 00:53:26.100
and plastic.

00:53:26.100 --> 00:53:29.750
It's like the whole thing
just shows how insane it is.

00:53:29.750 --> 00:53:32.330
So I think it's a
big design problem.

00:53:32.330 --> 00:53:35.000
When I asked Ron Gonen when
he was the deputy commissioner

00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:38.570
of sanitation for
New York if I could

00:53:38.570 --> 00:53:41.900
solve one problem for
him, what would it be?

00:53:41.900 --> 00:53:43.640
See they've built
composters now.

00:53:43.640 --> 00:53:47.570
So they are taking combustibles
in New York and composting.

00:53:47.570 --> 00:53:52.220
But they can't see the cup that
you're using here for water.

00:53:52.220 --> 00:53:54.800
We just had some water in a cup.

00:53:54.800 --> 00:53:56.690
AUDIENCE: They're
flaring the gas.

00:53:56.690 --> 00:53:57.650
WILLIAM MCDONOUGH: And
they'll flare the gas

00:53:57.650 --> 00:53:58.691
that comes from all that.

00:53:58.691 --> 00:53:59.540
Yeah, exactly.

00:53:59.540 --> 00:54:01.535
So it's suboptimal.

00:54:01.535 --> 00:54:04.160
And so I think we need a marking
system for all these materials

00:54:04.160 --> 00:54:05.600
that we can see.

00:54:05.600 --> 00:54:07.880
And it probably has to be
optical so we can see it

00:54:07.880 --> 00:54:11.090
anywhere-- that it can be done
by humans with two optical

00:54:11.090 --> 00:54:12.410
sensors her--

00:54:12.410 --> 00:54:16.460
very sophisticated,
and our robotic 3-D

00:54:16.460 --> 00:54:19.610
articulated elements.

00:54:19.610 --> 00:54:21.832
So I think we need
a marking system,

00:54:21.832 --> 00:54:24.290
and I think we need to make
this into something exquisitely

00:54:24.290 --> 00:54:25.250
beautiful.

00:54:25.250 --> 00:54:29.150
So we celebrate this instead
of saying minimize, avoid,

00:54:29.150 --> 00:54:31.940
reduce waste and
feel guilty, we say,

00:54:31.940 --> 00:54:36.650
eliminate the concept
of waste by design so

00:54:36.650 --> 00:54:40.220
that you can
celebrate, optimize,

00:54:40.220 --> 00:54:45.080
and share the joy of packaging.

00:54:45.080 --> 00:54:50.550
When I was a kid in Japan,
the package was the gift.

00:54:50.550 --> 00:54:52.974
How you ever seen
packaging in Japan?

00:54:52.974 --> 00:54:53.970
Oh.

00:54:53.970 --> 00:54:56.350
People will give you a gift
and it was so much fun.

00:54:56.350 --> 00:54:57.320
You'd unfold it.

00:54:57.320 --> 00:54:59.090
It was origami.

00:54:59.090 --> 00:55:01.910
You'd have a silk
scarf, you know.

00:55:01.910 --> 00:55:05.265
And then the question became,
who got the silk scarf?

00:55:05.265 --> 00:55:08.540
Do you give it back, cause
they can use it again

00:55:08.540 --> 00:55:11.120
or do you get to keep it
and use it for another gift?

00:55:11.120 --> 00:55:14.810
I mean, it's a whole culture.

00:55:14.810 --> 00:55:20.014
Eggs came in rice straw,
braided rice straw.

00:55:20.014 --> 00:55:22.790
AUDIENCE: I'll have to talk to
some of the sourcing people.

00:55:22.790 --> 00:55:23.160
WILLIAM MCDONOUGH: Yeah.

00:55:23.160 --> 00:55:24.270
But his biggest problem--

00:55:24.270 --> 00:55:26.940
Ron's biggest problem
he said was hamburger.

00:55:26.940 --> 00:55:31.500
A hamburger, an old hamburger
sitting in a plastic film

00:55:31.500 --> 00:55:33.720
in a foam tray.

00:55:33.720 --> 00:55:37.000
There was absolutely nothing
he could do with that.

00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:39.519
And that starts to send
the signals that we're

00:55:39.519 --> 00:55:42.060
going to have to do a lot more
things that are biodegradable,

00:55:42.060 --> 00:55:45.360
compostable coherently all
the way to the molecules,

00:55:45.360 --> 00:55:48.486
not into tiny bits of
plastic, which we see today.

00:55:48.486 --> 00:55:51.380
AUDIENCE: Yeah, the
zero waste by 2030--

00:55:51.380 --> 00:55:54.280
I sat in a group that asked
the organizations what

00:55:54.280 --> 00:55:58.480
they'd done so far and
nobody had an answer yet.

00:55:58.480 --> 00:56:00.250
So, we'll see.

00:56:00.250 --> 00:56:01.152
Optimism.

00:56:01.152 --> 00:56:02.110
MARY DAVIDGE: Optimism.

00:56:02.110 --> 00:56:04.230
You can be like
Bill, never give up.

00:56:04.230 --> 00:56:05.230
WILLIAM MCDONOUGH: Yeah.

00:56:05.230 --> 00:56:06.530
Persistence.

00:56:06.530 --> 00:56:08.710
MARY DAVIDGE: Persistence.

00:56:08.710 --> 00:56:10.760
OK, I think we've
reached our time.

00:56:10.760 --> 00:56:13.430
Thank you all so much for
coming, and thank you, Bill.

00:56:13.430 --> 00:56:14.030
WILLIAM MCDONOUGH:
You're welcome.

00:56:14.030 --> 00:56:15.863
MARY DAVIDGE: Thanks
so much for being here.

00:56:15.863 --> 00:56:17.980
[APPLAUSE]
