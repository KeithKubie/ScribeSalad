away he shrinks down he's really tiny

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680
away he shrinks down he's really tiny
 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.430
away he shrinks down he's really tiny
inside the hole and and fin talks to

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440
inside the hole and and fin talks to
 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.229
inside the hole and and fin talks to
them and then you know he gives an idea

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239
them and then you know he gives an idea
 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:04.849
them and then you know he gives an idea
says you're right he gets big again I

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:04.859
says you're right he gets big again I
 

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:06.349
says you're right he gets big again I
thought to myself you know you didn't

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:06.359
thought to myself you know you didn't
 

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:07.910
thought to myself you know you didn't
have to animate that and that was like a

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920
have to animate that and that was like a
 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.340
have to animate that and that was like a
really interesting sort of 360 that they

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:10.350
really interesting sort of 360 that they
 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:13.129
really interesting sort of 360 that they
you talk to it's like I just love that I

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:13.139
you talk to it's like I just love that I
 

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:14.569
you talk to it's like I just love that I
just love those little touches where

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:14.579
just love those little touches where
 

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:16.219
just love those little touches where
it's like they don't need to do that but

00:04:16.219 --> 00:04:16.229
it's like they don't need to do that but
 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:18.140
it's like they don't need to do that but
it's it's something Jake we're probably

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150
it's it's something Jake we're probably
 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:19.580
it's it's something Jake we're probably
doing that moment just like he's feeling

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590
doing that moment just like he's feeling
 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:23.060
doing that moment just like he's feeling
small so he literally goes mom um and

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070
small so he literally goes mom um and
 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:24.260
small so he literally goes mom um and
then the other thing I like is when they

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270
then the other thing I like is when they
 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.890
then the other thing I like is when they
see where he uh where the son live yeah

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:26.900
see where he uh where the son live yeah
 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:29.110
see where he uh where the son live yeah
and they find out if he's really rich so

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120
and they find out if he's really rich so
 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.060
and they find out if he's really rich so
rich that even the backgrounds are

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:31.070
rich that even the backgrounds are
 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:33.640
rich that even the backgrounds are
designed nicer like they're shaded nicer

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:33.650
designed nicer like they're shaded nicer
 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:35.350
designed nicer like they're shaded nicer
and there's more there's like color line

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360
and there's more there's like color line
 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:40.240
and there's more there's like color line
work and a lot more detail yeah I would

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:40.250
work and a lot more detail yeah I would
 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:43.420
work and a lot more detail yeah I would
say detail in more of the icy shading

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:43.430
say detail in more of the icy shading
 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:45.340
say detail in more of the icy shading
because a lot of backgrounds are very

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:45.350
because a lot of backgrounds are very
 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:47.350
because a lot of backgrounds are very
detailed but this was definitely shaded

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.360
detailed but this was definitely shaded
 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.719
detailed but this was definitely shaded
to cel-shaded and it played with light

00:04:49.719 --> 00:04:49.729
to cel-shaded and it played with light
 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:52.050
to cel-shaded and it played with light
and so I guess I guess it's more like

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.060
and so I guess I guess it's more like
 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.810
and so I guess I guess it's more like
things were clearer yes my Disney yeah

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:55.820
things were clearer yes my Disney yeah
 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:57.580
things were clearer yes my Disney yeah
yeah like cuz they're walking and

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.590
yeah like cuz they're walking and
 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:59.350
yeah like cuz they're walking and
there's the fairy and the fairy have

00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360
there's the fairy and the fairy have
 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.180
there's the fairy and the fairy have
some extra lines and it seems to be more

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:01.190
some extra lines and it seems to be more
 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:02.590
some extra lines and it seems to be more
like detail than that sense where

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:02.600
like detail than that sense where
 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.420
like detail than that sense where
everything was a little bit more clear

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:04.430
everything was a little bit more clear
 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:06.129
everything was a little bit more clear
and a little bit more crisp and a lot

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:06.139
and a little bit more crisp and a lot
 

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:08.200
and a little bit more crisp and a lot
more like and Jake even says it feels

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:08.210
more like and Jake even says it feels
 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:10.960
more like and Jake even says it feels
like a fairy tale yeah I really thought

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:10.970

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:12.100
like a fairy tale yeah I really thought

where like there's definitely a point
 

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:31.790
where like there's definitely a point
and a message and stuff but they still

00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:31.800
and a message and stuff but they still
 

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:34.350
and a message and stuff but they still
allowed it to serve go sporadic and
