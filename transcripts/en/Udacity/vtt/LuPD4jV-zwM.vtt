00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.530
Okay, great, we now have a UI defined
and our Android manifest is almost done.

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:08.800
But because we're using Google Services,
there is one meta tag that we need to

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:12.080
add, and that's just to specify that
we're using the Play Services Library.

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:15.070
We do that like this.

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:18.330
The metadata tag is used
within the application tag and

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.360
it should be a sibling of the activity,
not a child.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:27.785
Within that, your specified Android is
com.google.android.gms.version, and

00:00:27.785 --> 00:00:32.830
the value for this is
atInteger/GooglePlayServices_version.

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:34.730
Now as you can see here
it's showing up red.

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.880
It's showing up as an error
you cant resolve symbol,

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.640
but we're going to fix that in a moment.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.330
And also once that's been fixed, once
your application has been configured to

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.810
use these services libraries
whenever you compile,

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:49.000
this will be filled in automatically
with the correct number.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.890
So let's go ahead and do that.

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.170
So in order to do that there's one other
place that we need to ensure that we're

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.540
using the libraries for the services and
that's in the build.gradle for

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.010
the app itself.

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.116
So if I go into the build.gradle for
the app,

00:01:01.116 --> 00:01:04.310
down here you can see the dependencies
at bottom of build.gradle.

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:07.220
We're going to add a new
dependency in here.

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.086
So what we want to add is quite simply,

00:01:10.086 --> 00:01:15.836
to compile conduct
google.android.gms:play-services:6.5+.

00:01:15.836 --> 00:01:19.790
Now it's important to note that
your version here may be different.

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:21.950
It depends on what you're using, and

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.860
what version of Play Services
you've installed.

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.880
You can take a look in your system to
see what versions have been installed

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:28.960
for you.

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.540
And I'm just using this plus,
just to make life a little bit easier.

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:33.750
I believe I have 6.5.0.87.

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.990
But of course, by the time your
watching this Play Services

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.800
might be in version 7 or later and as
you can see here, you should avoid using

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.210
plus in version numbers because it
can lead to unpredictable behavior.

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.020
But I'm just going to leave it in for
the time being, for simplicity.

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.660
But do note when you're building your
applications that you should use

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:54.320
the correct version number here.

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.260
So now, once we've done this, we're
going to go to our main activity, and

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.070
we're going to access
the location provider.

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.570
Now, in our main activity, remember that
it contains just a single text view.

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.440
When the user runs the app,

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.080
we want it to get the current
location using location services, and

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.650
write the latitude of the current
location into that text view.

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.020
In order to do this, we're going to
need to write some code in the activity.

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.870
This code will create
the Google API Client, and

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.660
set up the required call backs to catch
responses back from location services.
