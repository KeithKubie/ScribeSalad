00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:07.660
So within in a day after the
earthquake

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:12.559
it starts to fill up the little by little with people
mostly they were just camping out under sheeted

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:13.489
tents 

00:00:13.489 --> 00:00:18.539
 just with some wood and covered by a regular sheet

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.449
or wood or whatever they could find

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:27.449
it's just amazing because it's a week ago
all of this was people with sheets over the sticks

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.070
and its just

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.929
transformed

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.960
into like, look at that thats people with a little store selling liquor
and cigarettes

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.390
 people recognize that
they've been living there for a long time

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.030
and so a lot of good things are just re-claimed
from the

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:45.980
damaged buildings around the city

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:47.980
mostly made out or wood and tin

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.660
and everything day that I come here there are more 
and more and more people 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.210
and now I think they are about thirty or thirty-five
thousand people here

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.900
I think that as everyone realises how slow tents and shelter
are coming they

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:05.510
they have resigned and  kind of deal with things themselves

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:07.710
the health issues range from

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.720
Malaria in Haiti and so thats mosquitos

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.670
and so theres daytan fever in the city

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:22.260
especially daytime mosquitos

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.619
there certainly be problem of rats and malnutrition just because people
do not have access to proper food

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:31.290
 then when you look at people living very
close together their problems are sanitation

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:31.920
and

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.689
the bad sensation goes along with diareahal disease
with typhoid

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:39.570
and just with general and

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:40.909
misery to be honest with living with bad sanitation

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:46.820
and it brings fly and more mosquitos

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:52.220
the other issue is more a safety issue is a 
 fire hazard in a place like this is absolutely huge

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.170
people's houses are very very close together

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:59.080
now they're made of wood but many are made of plastic or sheeting

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.610
like sheets from their bed

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.230
and people cook with open fire with charcoals and soother risk

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:09.279
and they are burning rubbish as well

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:10.529
so in he dry season where everything is tender and ready

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:16.279
its really really concerning to me and other people that there would be a major fire in one of these settlement areas

00:02:16.279 --> 00:02:19.549
alnmi lasante

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:24.529
started what we are calling mobile clinics but what they really are

00:02:24.529 --> 00:02:25.819
are comprehensive 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:27.559
primary health care posts

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:30.859
okay so the triage areas over there, they're waiting so they get triaged either here or over here so  were kind of scaling up

00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:36.349
we saw about 700 people

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:40.569
in the very first day because people don't have health care 
for a few weeks

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:46.939
and so we made what we are calling a health passport

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:52.919
so that the next time they are seen by a medical organization
they have their medical record written down now

00:02:52.919 --> 00:02:58.769
we have a team of about twenty doctors,
nurses, lab technicians, pharmicists and we do have primary

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:03.519
health care with reproductive health and women's health

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:09.539
and HIV testing, and each day we are adding more services to what we are doing

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:14.389
so we want to avoid just doing first aid, where
0:03:14.389,0:03:16.829
we are bandaging wounds and things like that

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:19.169
and get into comprehensive primary health care

00:03:19.169 --> 00:03:24.259
because these people are going to be living here for
a long time

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:25.249
they know that people anyone else had
admitted it because they are putting up their posts and houses 

00:03:25.249 --> 00:03:30.619
and so they are going to need primary health care

00:03:30.619 --> 00:03:32.400
the sound of people hitting their tin, the sound to me just

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.709
it just means that this represents the resiliance

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:41.819
of Haitians, because they are like we're here, we're still here
they have accepted the fast that they are not going anywhere

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:46.079
so let me build a small shelter and let me do the best that I can
