well we do a lot of research in schools
 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:08.379
well we do a lot of research in schools
so we we study schools we help schools

so we we study schools we help schools
 

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:10.570
so we we study schools we help schools
to understand how they need to change by

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:10.580
to understand how they need to change by
 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:12.850
to understand how they need to change by
helping them to become clear on what the

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:12.860
helping them to become clear on what the
 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.680
helping them to become clear on what the
problems are we think it's very

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:14.690
problems are we think it's very
 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:17.230
problems are we think it's very
important that before you go a reformer

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:17.240
important that before you go a reformer
 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.120
important that before you go a reformer
school or change your school that you

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:19.130
school or change your school that you
 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:21.100
school or change your school that you
clear what the problem is that you make

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:21.110
clear what the problem is that you make
 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:23.620
clear what the problem is that you make
sure that the remedy matches the problem

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:23.630
sure that the remedy matches the problem
 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:25.090
sure that the remedy matches the problem
which sounds like common sense but

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:25.100
which sounds like common sense but
 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.700
which sounds like common sense but
unfortunately that doesn't happen enough

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:26.710
unfortunately that doesn't happen enough
 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.010
unfortunately that doesn't happen enough
so so it's very important to give

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:30.020
so so it's very important to give
 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:32.650
so so it's very important to give
teachers principals a real clear sense

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:32.660
teachers principals a real clear sense
 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:35.319
teachers principals a real clear sense
of what they need to focus on in order

00:00:35.319 --> 00:00:35.329
of what they need to focus on in order
 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:37.049
of what they need to focus on in order
to get better results

00:00:37.049 --> 00:00:37.059
to get better results
 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:39.910
to get better results
PS 12 that I mentioned before they have

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920
PS 12 that I mentioned before they have
 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.069
PS 12 that I mentioned before they have
a great data person who can give

00:00:42.069 --> 00:00:42.079
a great data person who can give
 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:45.549
a great data person who can give
teachers very precise data on each and

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:45.559
teachers very precise data on each and
 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:46.809
teachers very precise data on each and
every one of their students so they know

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:46.819
every one of their students so they know
 

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:48.939
every one of their students so they know
exactly what they need to work on that's

00:00:48.939 --> 00:00:48.949
exactly what they need to work on that's
 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:51.129
exactly what they need to work on that's
very important if we don't want teachers

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:51.139
very important if we don't want teachers
 

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:53.020
very important if we don't want teachers
to be more effective what they do

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030
to be more effective what they do
 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.000
to be more effective what they do
the alternative is guesswork and

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010
the alternative is guesswork and
 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:00.440
the alternative is guesswork and
guesswork doesn't work that well

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:00.450
 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.800
I see lots of examples you know I see

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:03.810
I see lots of examples you know I see
 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.050
I see lots of examples you know I see
schools that are using smart boards now

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060
schools that are using smart boards now
 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.030
schools that are using smart boards now
very effectively I barely understand

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040
very effectively I barely understand
 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.770
very effectively I barely understand
lose myself still but I'm impressed but

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780
lose myself still but I'm impressed but
 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.290

instruction because it makes it much

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010
instruction because it makes it much
 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.310
instruction because it makes it much
more interactive and the kids seem to

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320
more interactive and the kids seem to
 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.010
more interactive and the kids seem to
respond extremely well because you know

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020
respond extremely well because you know
 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.300
respond extremely well because you know
this is like they're working with

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310
this is like they're working with
 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.820
this is like they're working with
computers and video games all the time I

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830
computers and video games all the time I
 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.440

was visiting the classroom the other day

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450
was visiting the classroom the other day
 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.300
was visiting the classroom the other day
where a teacher was using video games to

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310
where a teacher was using video games to
 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.690
where a teacher was using video games to
teach history lesson and kids were

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700
teach history lesson and kids were
 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.270
teach history lesson and kids were
totally engaged there's a math program

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280
totally engaged there's a math program
 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.270
totally engaged there's a math program
I've been working with now called FG and

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280
I've been working with now called FG and
 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.560
I've been working with now called FG and
it it allowed that the software allows

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570
it it allowed that the software allows
 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.050
it it allowed that the software allows
that it can figure out what the student

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060
that it can figure out what the student
 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.180
that it can figure out what the student
doesn't understand and take them

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:44.190
doesn't understand and take them
 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:45.850
doesn't understand and take them
backwards

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860
backwards
 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.710
backwards
so it can figure out what they what they

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720
so it can figure out what they what they
 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.330
so it can figure out what they what they
did learn and then build a foundation

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340
did learn and then build a foundation
 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.670
did learn and then build a foundation
back up and the software's doing that so

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680
back up and the software's doing that so
 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.380
back up and the software's doing that so
the what it does is it gives the

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390
the what it does is it gives the
 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.969
the what it does is it gives the
children the ability have more control

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979
children the ability have more control
 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.190
children the ability have more control
over learning which is I think what we

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200
over learning which is I think what we
 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.590
over learning which is I think what we
really want so there are a lot of

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600
really want so there are a lot of
 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.109
really want so there are a lot of
examples of good technology out there I

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119
examples of good technology out there I
 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.059
examples of good technology out there I
always say the most important thing is

00:02:05.059 --> 00:02:05.069
always say the most important thing is
 

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:06.609
always say the most important thing is
to make sure that teachers are

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:06.619
to make sure that teachers are
 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:09.710
to make sure that teachers are
comfortable with using the technology in

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720
comfortable with using the technology in
 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.990
comfortable with using the technology in
many schools the children um are more

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000
many schools the children um are more
 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.309
many schools the children um are more
comfortable with it than the adults and

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319
comfortable with it than the adults and
 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:19.699
comfortable with it than the adults and
that's a problem students would rather

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709
that's a problem students would rather
 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:23.240
that's a problem students would rather
watch a big thing video then sit and

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250
watch a big thing video then sit and
 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.199
