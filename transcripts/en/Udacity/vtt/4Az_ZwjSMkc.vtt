00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
What we want to prove is that both parties obtained the same key.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
For the server to obtain the key, it needed to be able to decrypt this message

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
using the password.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
And so what we're going to add to the message

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
is instead of just sending this value, we're going to also send a challenge,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and that challenge is going to be encrypted using the key.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
The challenge is just some random value selected by the server.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
And now Alice needs to be able to obtain the right key.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
That proves that she knew the password.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And using that key, she can decrypt this message and obtain r.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
This effectively demonstrates to Alice that she's talking to the right server--

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
at least a server that knew her password--

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
because the key that's produced here could only be produced correctly

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000
if the server was able to decrypt the message that Alice sent encrypted with that password.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
This hasn't yet proven anything to the server.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
So to finish the protocol, Alice has to send a response back to the server

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
that proves that she was able to obtain r.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
So Alice could do this by proving that she learned r.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
She could send the message encrypting with the key r back to the server.

00:01:06.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Does this work?
