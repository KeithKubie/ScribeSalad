00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:02.730
SPEAKER: One notification
trying to do everything,

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.050
or 10 notifications
trying to take over

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:06.570
the whole notification chain?

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:08.670
How about the best
of both worlds

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.000
with bundled notifications?

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.910
By bundling notifications
into a group,

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.320
users will be able to act
on the entire group at once

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.710
or expand the group
to see and act

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.490
on the individual
notifications in the group.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.220
Now I've talked about
building a great notification

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.180
with notification
so let's assume

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.259
you've already built great
individual notifications.

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:34.910
If users aren't getting
any benefit, such as more

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.520
information or actions
out of expanding

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.520
individual notifications, you
should work on that first.

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.440
But once you have awesome
individual notifications,

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.950
bundling similar
notifications together

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:51.830
is done by calling set
group for each notification.

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:53.550
By default,
notifications will be

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.290
ordered by when they're posted.

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:57.840
But you can override
it with set sort key

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.500
and the system will sort
by that value instead.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.610
There's one other part to
bundled notifications, though--

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.980
a summary notification.

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.390
On Marshmallow and
lower phones and tablets

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.710
that don't directly support
bundled notifications.

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.090
Only the summary notification
will be displayed.

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.560
So make sure it's also
a great notification.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.880
The inbox style is a great
candidate for these summary

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.260
notifications to give users
a quick overview of all

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.470
the notifications they have.

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.670
Just make sure to call Set
Group with that same key,

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.260
and then call Set Group
Summary true to denote

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.210
that notification as your
summary notification.

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.880
Note, you'll still want to
build a summary notification

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.970
on devices that support
bundled notifications,

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.210
as that's used
indirectly by the system

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.500
to extract information
for the header

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.870
when the group is collapsed.

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:55.570
Now, if you're thinking to
yourself, ugh, add Set Group

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:59.480
and set Group Summary,
sounds like a lot of work.

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.150
There's two additional
reasons you should really

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.490
bundle your notifications.

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.330
For one, there's
a lot of users out

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.690
there already with devices that
support bundled notifications.

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.720
Every Android Wear user that's
right, by using this API,

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.980
you're going to be making a
great experience for every one

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.510
of those users as well, even if
they're still using a Kit Kat

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.530
device.

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.760
Secondly, API 24
and higher devices

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.190
are going to bundle your
notifications for you,

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.280
if you post four or more
without any grouping.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.300
And you probably
have a better idea

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.650
of what bundles and
summary notification

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.480
make sense for your own app.

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.790
So if you're posting
multiple notifications,

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.460
use bundled notifications to
help you build better apps.

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:48.010
