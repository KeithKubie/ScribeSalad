00:00:01.146 --> 00:00:05.226
&gt;&gt;Pamela: One of the most challenging
things for children to do is

00:00:05.286 --> 00:00:09.176
to bring themselves into
a state of calm.

00:00:09.266 --> 00:00:13.826
Mindfulness contributes to a
child's ability to self-regulate

00:00:13.826 --> 00:00:17.806
and bring themselves into
a calm state for learning.

00:00:21.446 --> 00:00:24.356
&gt;&gt;Lindsey: When students come
from the dining hall after lunch,

00:00:24.866 --> 00:00:28.326
we do a very short guided
mindfulness practice.

00:00:28.676 --> 00:00:33.706
We're ready to transition from the
energy of lunch into a different kind

00:00:33.706 --> 00:00:35.376
of energy for our humanities.

00:00:38.206 --> 00:00:41.806
It's a way for students to
sort of recenter themselves,

00:00:41.806 --> 00:00:43.636
check in with their brains
and their hearts

00:00:43.636 --> 00:00:45.936
and their bodies, and
see where they're at.

00:00:47.746 --> 00:00:49.636
&gt;&gt;Okay, kiddos. We're
going to get started

00:00:52.046 --> 00:00:57.206
Taking a big breath in. And
letting it out with a little noise.

00:00:58.846 --> 00:01:02.136
&gt;&gt;I always start with a
couple kind of big breaths.

00:01:02.796 --> 00:01:04.366
&gt;&gt;Another big one in.

00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:11.306
&gt;&gt;Here at our school, we're really
aware of the vast variety of needs

00:01:11.306 --> 00:01:14.446
that students can have, whether
they're academic needs, social needs,

00:01:14.446 --> 00:01:17.736
emotional needs, behavioral
needs, or physical needs.

00:01:18.126 --> 00:01:22.726
&gt;&gt;Our eyes are going closed.
If that doesn't feel good,

00:01:23.326 --> 00:01:26.456
we're looking down or covering our eyes.

00:01:27.056 --> 00:01:29.596
&gt;&gt;I never require kids
to close their eyes,

00:01:29.596 --> 00:01:31.996
because that can feel really unsettling.

00:01:31.996 --> 00:01:34.406
We talk about looking into the palms
of their hands or they're looking

00:01:34.406 --> 00:01:37.196
into the seam on their sneakers,
whatever works for them.

00:01:37.506 --> 00:01:40.646
&gt;&gt;We are here. We are safe.

00:01:41.136 --> 00:01:45.306
&gt;&gt;I have a few students who can
sit cross-legged for an hour

00:01:45.306 --> 00:01:46.766
on end, it would be totally fine.

00:01:46.766 --> 00:01:50.576
I have other kids that, for their
bodies, that's incredibly challenging.

00:01:51.006 --> 00:01:54.746
So being seated in a chair or at
a wall, so they have something

00:01:54.746 --> 00:01:56.846
to lean into, is really helpful.

00:01:56.846 --> 00:02:01.506
The kids who had stuffed animals
needed those, either for sort

00:02:01.506 --> 00:02:07.816
of like a sensory tactile input or
a soothing comfort sort of input.

00:02:07.816 --> 00:02:10.796
So there's no judgment around it,
but there's a level of awareness

00:02:10.956 --> 00:02:13.326
so they can do what they need to do.

00:02:13.546 --> 00:02:18.796
&gt;&gt;Three, two, one.

00:02:19.506 --> 00:02:21.326
&gt;&gt;And then, I always
count down at the end.

00:02:21.846 --> 00:02:24.756
&gt;&gt;Bring yourself back to this room.

00:02:25.726 --> 00:02:27.100
Eyes open. Eyes open.

00:02:27.276 --> 00:02:30.736
&gt;&gt;A few kids will fall asleep,
and they need to be woken up.

00:02:30.966 --> 00:02:35.216
&gt;&gt;All right. Silent hands for shares.

00:02:35.216 --> 00:02:39.096
&gt;&gt;I do like to build in
reflections as often as possible.

00:02:39.096 --> 00:02:41.046
&gt;&gt;Student: When I was
in the dining hall,

00:02:41.626 --> 00:02:45.296
my heart was going beep,
beep, beep, beep.

00:02:45.866 --> 00:02:47.796
&gt;&gt;Student: But now, when
we did mindfulness,

00:02:48.216 --> 00:02:50.336
my heart feels so nice and calm.

00:02:50.916 --> 00:02:53.156
&gt;&gt;Student: We do mindfulness
because-- tell them.

00:02:53.156 --> 00:03:00.286
&gt;&gt;Student: We do mindfulness because
during lunch, it gets a little crazy.

00:03:02.406 --> 00:03:09.766
And so, when we go upstairs, we calm
down so we can transfer to writing.

00:03:17.276 --> 00:03:21.486
&gt;&gt;Pamela: Very often, practices like
mindfulness enable children to get

00:03:21.576 --> 00:03:27.436
that inner calm again after they've had
a stressful experience in a classroom,

00:03:27.436 --> 00:03:28.946
in a lunchroom, in the hallway.

00:03:29.046 --> 00:03:33.876
&gt;&gt;Lindsey: Who can tell me what it
means for a text to be a fiction text?

00:03:34.726 --> 00:03:40.936
&gt;&gt;Student: Fiction is when it's not
real and non-fiction is when it is real.

00:03:41.156 --> 00:03:42.136
&gt;&gt;Lindsey: Nice.

00:03:42.206 --> 00:03:46.646
&gt;&gt;The impact of the mindfulness
practice is really this general sense

00:03:46.646 --> 00:03:50.746
of them being more comfortable
and confident with themselves

00:03:50.746 --> 00:03:55.366
and they're varying needs and decreases
in anxiety around academic work.

00:03:55.886 --> 00:03:59.406
&gt;&gt;Double kiss for your
brain. Amazing job.
