00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:01.901
- [Voiceover] Hey grammarians,
today we're talking about

00:00:01.901 --> 00:00:04.688
compound prepositions
which are prepositions

00:00:04.688 --> 00:00:06.859
that have more than one syllable.

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:08.949
And a syllable is like a unit

00:00:08.949 --> 00:00:11.549
of rhythmic measurement in language.

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:13.024
So for example you could say,

00:00:13.024 --> 00:00:15.191
com-pound prep-o-si-tions.

00:00:17.393 --> 00:00:18.226
Right so,

00:00:19.114 --> 00:00:23.097
the word compound has two syllables here

00:00:23.097 --> 00:00:25.430
and the word prep-o-si-tions

00:00:26.376 --> 00:00:27.209
has four.

00:00:28.126 --> 00:00:30.912
And it's how many rhythmic
word sounds there are.

00:00:30.912 --> 00:00:31.772
That's all it means.

00:00:31.772 --> 00:00:33.246
And it generally tends to mean that

00:00:33.246 --> 00:00:35.173
a word is more complicated.

00:00:35.173 --> 00:00:36.729
Adding to the complication is

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:40.003
that a lot of these words
have multiple meanings.

00:00:40.003 --> 00:00:41.837
Beginning with between.

00:00:41.837 --> 00:00:43.521
So between can have a literal meaning,

00:00:43.521 --> 00:00:45.402
but it can also have a
metaphorical meaning.

00:00:45.402 --> 00:00:47.294
And what it means is that when

00:00:47.294 --> 00:00:49.012
you use between in a sentence,

00:00:49.012 --> 00:00:53.179
you're considering multiple
objects as individuals.

00:00:54.461 --> 00:00:57.294
So, between considers individuals.

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:59.275
I'll explain.

00:00:59.275 --> 00:01:00.912
So you could say something literal.

00:01:00.912 --> 00:01:03.780
Like, "The firefly zipped
between the raindrops."

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.780
Literally going in between each one.

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:10.456
But you could also use it

00:01:10.456 --> 00:01:13.971
in an abstract, metaphorical way.

00:01:13.971 --> 00:01:15.350
"What do you want to watch?

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.155
"I can't decide between
Humdinger! and Police-Cat."

00:01:19.155 --> 00:01:21.988
Right, which are made up TV shows.

00:01:22.941 --> 00:01:24.821
This describes not a
physical relationship,

00:01:24.821 --> 00:01:26.331
but the relationship of ideas.

00:01:26.331 --> 00:01:28.467
You're choosing between two ideas.

00:01:28.467 --> 00:01:31.416
Or making a decision between two concepts.

00:01:31.416 --> 00:01:35.561
Now, between often gets
confused with the word among.

00:01:35.561 --> 00:01:37.325
And they do have distinct meanings.

00:01:37.325 --> 00:01:39.241
Because where between
considers individuals,

00:01:39.241 --> 00:01:43.408
among is a preposition
that considers collections.

00:01:44.756 --> 00:01:47.416
So among considers collectively.

00:01:47.416 --> 00:01:49.166
Among can also have a

00:01:50.413 --> 00:01:52.584
literal, physical meaning.

00:01:52.584 --> 00:01:54.751
Or a metaphorical meaning.

00:01:55.962 --> 00:01:56.938
We could say something like,

00:01:56.938 --> 00:02:00.862
"Ashley and Cyrus frolicked
among the daisies."

00:02:00.862 --> 00:02:03.277
And we could say this
because we're not really

00:02:03.277 --> 00:02:05.901
distinguishing between
each individual daisy,

00:02:05.901 --> 00:02:07.085
the way that the firefly up here

00:02:07.085 --> 00:02:08.757
in this sentence is distinguishing between

00:02:08.757 --> 00:02:11.856
each individual raindrop
that it flies between.

00:02:11.856 --> 00:02:14.643
I imagine Ashley and
Cyrus as dancing through

00:02:14.643 --> 00:02:17.464
or frolicking through a field of daisies,

00:02:17.464 --> 00:02:19.879
and they are not distinguishing
between each one.

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:22.596
You can also use among metaphorically.

00:02:22.596 --> 00:02:26.032
And say, "Among the ideas you've had,

00:02:26.032 --> 00:02:28.334
"I like this one best."

00:02:28.334 --> 00:02:30.911
So considering the entire collection of

00:02:30.911 --> 00:02:32.432
ideas that you might've had,

00:02:32.432 --> 00:02:34.638
like say for a television show like

00:02:34.638 --> 00:02:37.390
something called Humdinger! and
something called Police-Cat.

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.236
Among those ideas, among

00:02:39.236 --> 00:02:42.556
like a multitude of ideas I like this one.

00:02:42.556 --> 00:02:46.411
But the difference is, in
this in this prepositional

00:02:46.411 --> 00:02:48.547
phrase, that we're just
sort of considering

00:02:48.547 --> 00:02:51.403
all of those ideas as a collective group.

00:02:51.403 --> 00:02:55.128
Let's look at some more prepositions.

00:02:55.128 --> 00:02:56.314
Around is a word that has both

00:02:56.314 --> 00:02:59.588
a literal and a metaphorical connotation.

00:02:59.588 --> 00:03:01.515
And around is in the literal sense,

00:03:01.515 --> 00:03:04.708
is pretty, pretty explanatory.

00:03:04.708 --> 00:03:06.101
Pretty self-explanatory.

00:03:06.101 --> 00:03:08.806
"The fox ran around the tree."

00:03:08.806 --> 00:03:11.209
Right, so we got this tree,

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:14.626
then we got a little fox going around it.

00:03:18.088 --> 00:03:20.279
There goes the weird lookin' little foxy.

00:03:20.279 --> 00:03:21.510
But in the metaphorical sense,

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.147
we can also use this connotation of

00:03:23.147 --> 00:03:24.900
going around something in a circle,

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.207
you know, "The mayor
talked around the issue."

00:03:29.207 --> 00:03:31.878
You can use the word around as a metaphor

00:03:31.878 --> 00:03:36.150
to say that someone is avoiding something.

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:37.880
By instead of addressing it head-on,

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.645
just going what, what's that?

00:03:39.645 --> 00:03:40.478
Nope.

00:03:41.851 --> 00:03:44.022
And here's your little trouble box, here.

00:03:44.022 --> 00:03:46.239
So you can take this physical idea and

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:50.372
extend it into the realm of
the figurative in language.

00:03:50.372 --> 00:03:52.230
Against, right, has this connotation

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.480
of opposing or opposition.

00:03:56.862 --> 00:03:58.790
And literally you can say something like,

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:02.145
"Rudyard leaned heavily against a tree."

00:04:02.145 --> 00:04:03.817
Or you can use it metaphorically,

00:04:03.817 --> 00:04:06.429
by saying you're opposed to something,

00:04:06.429 --> 00:04:08.855
you're opposed to an idea, right?

00:04:08.855 --> 00:04:11.874
"Georgie campaigned against clog dancing."

00:04:11.874 --> 00:04:15.972
Which for the record, is
a beautiful tradition.

00:04:15.972 --> 00:04:17.621
Within is a word that basically

00:04:17.621 --> 00:04:19.621
just means in or inside.

00:04:20.874 --> 00:04:23.291
And you can use it literally,

00:04:24.128 --> 00:04:29.119
you know, to say, "There's
a frog within the pond."

00:04:29.119 --> 00:04:32.806
Which is maybe a little
ponderous but you get the idea.

00:04:32.806 --> 00:04:34.162
But if you wanted to get metaphorical,

00:04:34.162 --> 00:04:36.821
you could say non-literally,

00:04:36.821 --> 00:04:39.863
"Who can say what is
within Ralph's heart?"

00:04:39.863 --> 00:04:42.180
Right, and we're not
asking, you know, what's

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.721
the condition of his cardiac muscles,

00:04:44.721 --> 00:04:45.870
we're not talking about the blood,

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.973
we're talking about what spiritually

00:04:48.973 --> 00:04:52.158
or what emotionally is
going on inside Ralph.

00:04:52.158 --> 00:04:53.632
Without is an interesting one because

00:04:53.632 --> 00:04:55.838
it kinda has, it used to
mean something different.

00:04:55.838 --> 00:05:00.192
It used to mean something
more akin to outside,

00:05:00.192 --> 00:05:03.617
but now it has this
connotation of just not with.

00:05:03.617 --> 00:05:05.917
It's the opposite of with.

00:05:05.917 --> 00:05:10.084
"I guess we're going to the
Candy Planet without Stu, then."

00:05:12.216 --> 00:05:15.351
All right, let's look
at two more examples.

00:05:15.351 --> 00:05:16.826
So inside basically means the

00:05:16.826 --> 00:05:19.159
same thing as in, or within.

00:05:21.684 --> 00:05:22.961
You can use it much the same way

00:05:22.961 --> 00:05:25.504
as you would use any of
those other two words.

00:05:25.504 --> 00:05:28.128
So you could use it literally.

00:05:28.128 --> 00:05:30.566
And ask, "What's inside the box?"

00:05:30.566 --> 00:05:33.236
But we can also use
this kind of interiority

00:05:33.236 --> 00:05:34.757
as a metaphor and say,

00:05:34.757 --> 00:05:37.822
"What's inside her mind right now?"

00:05:37.822 --> 00:05:39.331
Because the difference between that

00:05:39.331 --> 00:05:40.852
and the literal sentence
is you can open the box,

00:05:40.852 --> 00:05:43.836
you can't really open someone's mind.

00:05:43.836 --> 00:05:45.926
Not physically, anyway.

00:05:45.926 --> 00:05:47.145
You could open someone's mind by

00:05:47.145 --> 00:05:50.059
showing them new foods and movies

00:05:50.059 --> 00:05:51.812
and books and music and stuff.

00:05:51.812 --> 00:05:53.948
But you can't really get inside

00:05:53.948 --> 00:05:58.115
someone's head unless you're
a psychic mind wizard.

00:05:59.699 --> 00:06:01.228
Finally, beyond.

00:06:01.228 --> 00:06:02.946
And beyond is a preposition that

00:06:02.946 --> 00:06:06.016
has this connotation of being

00:06:06.016 --> 00:06:06.849
far away.

00:06:09.574 --> 00:06:12.802
Like far away and past some point.

00:06:12.802 --> 00:06:14.892
It also has a literal meaning

00:06:14.892 --> 00:06:18.119
and it has a metaphorical meaning.

00:06:18.119 --> 00:06:20.697
So for example, you could say literally,

00:06:20.697 --> 00:06:24.969
"Beyond those mountains
is Terrell's kingdom."

00:06:24.969 --> 00:06:26.397
Right, we're using these mountains

00:06:26.397 --> 00:06:29.397
as like a literal, literal boundary.

00:06:30.739 --> 00:06:32.341
Little snow-cap peaks.

00:06:32.341 --> 00:06:33.990
And past them

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:34.823
is

00:06:36.826 --> 00:06:37.659
Terrellia.

00:06:40.205 --> 00:06:42.585
But you can also use it as a metaphor,

00:06:42.585 --> 00:06:46.358
we can use this physical
relationship as a metaphor.

00:06:46.358 --> 00:06:47.670
You can say something like,

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:49.260
"This strawberry's flavor is

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.952
"beyond anything I've ever had before."

00:06:52.952 --> 00:06:54.346
Right, this is like the world's

00:06:54.346 --> 00:06:56.389
most delicious strawberry and

00:06:56.389 --> 00:06:57.829
its taste, its flavor,

00:06:57.829 --> 00:07:00.452
surpasses, it goes past you know,

00:07:00.452 --> 00:07:02.171
over the mountains and into Terrellia,

00:07:02.171 --> 00:07:03.285
that's how delicious it is.

00:07:03.285 --> 00:07:06.952
Oh my goodness, what a
strawberry, you know?

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:10.449
We're using this physical relationship

00:07:10.449 --> 00:07:12.422
as a figurative metaphor.

00:07:12.422 --> 00:07:14.466
We're using that to say
that this strawberry

00:07:14.466 --> 00:07:15.708
over here is way better than

00:07:15.708 --> 00:07:18.413
anything else that we've had previously.

00:07:18.413 --> 00:07:19.611
Like this

00:07:19.611 --> 00:07:20.444
square

00:07:21.689 --> 00:07:22.560
rock.

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:25.810
This is, you used to eat rocks before.

00:07:27.579 --> 00:07:29.363
Now you've had a strawberry
for the first time

00:07:29.363 --> 00:07:33.930
and oh my goodness it's
just blowing you away.

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:35.633
Although we do eat rocks all the time,

00:07:35.633 --> 00:07:39.685
if you think about what
salt is, technically.

00:07:39.685 --> 00:07:41.566
Anyway, these are eight of the most

00:07:41.566 --> 00:07:44.096
common compound prepositions.

00:07:44.096 --> 00:07:47.138
There are more listed in the exercises.

00:07:47.138 --> 00:07:48.647
You can learn anything.

00:07:48.647 --> 00:07:49.480
David out.
