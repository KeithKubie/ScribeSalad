00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:22.240
&gt;&gt; Wise and discerning.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.150
&gt;&gt; Dignified, scholarly,
brilliant.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.720
&gt;&gt; Bold, compassionate,
dedicated.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.220
&gt;&gt; Rounded, open, engaged.

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:37.760
&gt;&gt; Eloquent, visionary, strong,
thoughtful and diplomatic.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.190
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: The Kluge
Prize rewards thorough,

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.280
assessable scholarship and
strong public leadership.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.370
And Drew Gilpin Faust embodies
all the traits we were seeking

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:49.670
as a prize recipient.

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:50.970
&gt;&gt; Drew Gilpin Faust:

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:54.280
I see myself fundamentally
as a historian.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.000
I grew up in the Shenandoah
Valley of Virginia at a time

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.050
when much was changing but when
history also was very present.

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:06.130
It was in 1950's and 60's,
we lived in the midst

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.270
of Civil War battlefields.

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.460
But it was also the time of the
emerging civil rights movement.

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.740
Brown v. Board of course, the
effort to close public schools

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.880
in Virginia through
massive resistance.

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.480
All of that was very much in the
air when I was a small child.

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.100
So I think the questions of
past and present intersected

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.070
for me very vividly as
the American traditions

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.770
of governance and race and
justice and equality all played

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.830
out before my eyes
but also were part

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:39.430
of what I was hearing about,

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.970
the places in which I
lived and their history.

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:44.270
&gt;&gt; Michael Drake: I think

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.390
that Drew Faust was an excellent
choice for the 2018 Kluge Prize

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:48.690
for the Study of Humanity

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:50.480
because her life
has been a study.

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.520
She's a humanist
and a historian,

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.160
her life has been the
study of who we are

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.420
and how we deal with the crises.

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.830
But then her life has also
been as an exemplary leader

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.360
through the turbulent
times that we all live in.

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.550
And so she not only has
researched and studied this

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:10.990
as a scholar for all of us she
has also exemplified leadership

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:15.900
in humanity and I think it's
wonderful, a wonderful choice.

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.230
&gt;&gt; Edward Markey: Drew Faust is
a historian so she understands

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.020
that it's not just science
and technology as important

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.900
as they are it's the
values that are infused

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.240
into those technologies.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.530
And that's where her
background helped to ensure

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.940
that we were constantly
lifting our gaze

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.170
to the constellation
of possibilities.

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.240
&gt;&gt; David Blight: She has been a
historian of the American South,

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.810
of American women, and of
the American Civil War,

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:49.220
and of the intellectual history
of the South in particular.

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.960
As distinguished and
as important to anyone

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:59.260
in the past 40 years her work
will always stand as some

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.300
of the most important
contributions

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.690
to Civil War history,
the history of the South,

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.690
and the history of
American women.

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.070
&gt;&gt; Susan Collins: You have made
a real difference throughout

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:13.120
your entire professional career.

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:18.490
And I know that you will
continue to do so as you put it

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:23.080
to help us a build a
more enlightened world.

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:29.380
So congratulations and best
wishes on your future endeavors.

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.130
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Drew, I want to
congratulate you on your service

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.200
as a historian and as an
innovator in higher education.

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.270
Thanks to you both
the general public

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:40.580
and our leaders have a
greater understanding

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.490
of our shared history
and the experiences

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:45.510
that have shaped our nation.

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.510

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:59.040
[ Applause ]

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.720
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: Dr.
Hayden, members of Congress,

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.190
members of the diplomatic corps,

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:06.530
and members of the Library's
James Madison Council.

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:10.120
Scholars and distinguished
guests, I'm John Haskell,

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:11.720
director of the Kluge Center.

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.480
On behalf of the Library of
Congress it is my pleasure

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.650
to welcome you to
the seventh conferral

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:21.550
of the John W. Kluge Prize
for the Study of Humanity.

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:24.030
Incidentally this event is
being recorded for placement

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.860
on the library's website and
it is being livestreamed,

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.670
so I also welcome our
viewers from around the world.

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:33.130
The John W. Kluge Prize for
Achievement in the Study

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:36.880
of Humanity is unique
among international awards.

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:41.170
The prize covers a wide range of
scholarly fields, virtually all

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:45.220
of the humanities and social
sciences and other areas.

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.650
It honors scholars who over a
sustained period have distilled

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:52.900
wisdom from the cumulative
record of human experience

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.800
and have had a major
impact on public life.

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.140
The selection process
is democratic and broad.

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:03.710
The Library solicits nominations
from a wide range of national

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:07.130
and international
individuals and institutions

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:11.230
and uses a rigorous selection
process involving curators,

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:14.590
specialists and a distinguished
panel of outside scholars,

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:17.470
and of course the
Librarian of Congress.

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:21.000
We are deeply grateful
to the late John W. Kluge

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.640
for his generosity in
creating the endowment

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:27.410
that funds this prize, as well
as the wide-ranging research

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:30.290
of the many visiting scholars
at the Kluge Center here

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:32.780
within the Thomas
Jefferson Building.

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:36.620
Now here in this institutional
symbol of the importance

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:40.180
of knowledge to our
democracy we especially want

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:42.490
to thank the Congress of the
United States for creating

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:46.230
and sustaining the library for
over two centuries beginning

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:49.750
with Thomas Jefferson's amazing
collection which has grown

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:53.430
to over 160 million items.

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:56.440
The US Congress has been
the greatest single patron

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:59.120
of a library in the
history of the world.

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.080
We thank the distinguished
members who are

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:03.520
in the audience and
with us tonight.

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:05.940
And now I have the
honor to introduce

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:09.510
to you the 14th Librarian of
Congress Dr. Carla Hayden.

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:13.120

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:14.920
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden:
Thank you, John.

[ Applause ]

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:19.510
Thank you.

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:20.870
I'm so honored and
pleased to welcome all

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:23.850
of the distinguished guests
tonight, and thank you so much

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:27.260
for being here with us on
this very specially evening.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.010
John has already told you a
little bit about the history

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:33.840
of the Kluge Prize but
before we go any further,

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:38.640
I'd like to recognize one very
special person in our audience,

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:41.140
my predecessor, the
13th Librarian

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:44.510
of Congress Dr. James
Billington.

00:06:44.510 --> 00:07:04.080
[ Applause ]

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:08.380
Dr. Billington had the
vision to create this prize,

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:11.030
as well as the Kluge Center

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:14.020
and he worked alongside
the late John W. Kluge

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:16.770
to turn this dream into reality.

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:19.990
So we thank you Dr.
Billington for your vision

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:22.090
and for your many
years of service

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:24.450
and leadership to our nation.

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:29.910
It is now my great
pleasure and privilege

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:33.660
to confer the seventh
Kluge Prize for Achievement

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:38.870
in the Study of Humanity
on our laureate.

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:42.870
Drew Gilpin Faust stands
among the most distinguished

00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:46.170
historians of our generation.

00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:49.540
Throughout her career she has
demonstrated a clear vision

00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:53.630
and intellectual courage,
spending countless hours

00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:57.440
in the archives and among
primary sources, some right here

00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:02.130
at the Library of Congress
uncovering the vital research

00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:05.520
and threads of our
country's social history.

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:09.270
Her work has added to our
understanding of the Civil War,

00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:11.470
the history of the
South, and the history

00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:14.100
of women in the United States.

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:17.620
By granting us a greater
understanding of our heritage

00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:21.980
and some of the decisive ideas
and conflicts that shaped it.

00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:24.950
Her work continues
to provide context

00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:28.290
to the many challenges we
face in public life today.

00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:33.040
In addition to her skilled
craft as a historian

00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:37.730
and educator she has been a
leader in the public sphere.

00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:42.090
In 2007 following her very
successful tenure as dean

00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:45.230
of the Radcliffe
Institute she took office

00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:48.640
as Harvard's 28th president.

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:51.140
And for over a decade
at the helm of one

00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:53.730
of the world's most
distinguished centers

00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:57.180
of higher research and learning
she guided the institution

00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:01.090
through a time of
national financial crisis.

00:09:01.090 --> 00:09:04.560
And during her leadership
she expanded financial aid

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:06.430
for undergraduates working

00:09:06.430 --> 00:09:10.660
to make the Harvard community
more diverse and assessable.

00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:14.010
And she ably promoted
the university's mission

00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:17.480
in the arts, sciences
and humanities.

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:21.850
She also led in the creation
of innovative learning

00:09:21.850 --> 00:09:24.080
and interdisciplinary programs

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:25.990
and strengthened
the university's

00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:28.400
international impact.

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:31.740
Dr. Drew Gilpin Faust will
you please come forward

00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:34.210
to receive the Kluge
Prize for Achievement

00:09:34.210 --> 00:09:35.820
in the Study of Humanity.

00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:39.510
Please join me in
welcoming Dr. Faust.

00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:59.040
[ Applause ]

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:00.840
And now we will hear
from our laureate.

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:09.090
[ Applause ]

00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:11.890
&gt;&gt; Drew Gilpin Faust: Thank you
to all of you for being here,

00:10:11.890 --> 00:10:14.730
I know how many things
there are to do in this city

00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:16.030
and that you would choose

00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:18.940
to be here tonight
means the world to me.

00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:21.260
And I wanted to especially
thank Carla Hayden

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:25.150
for awarding me this
prize and for taking

00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:26.450
on the Library of Congress.

00:10:26.450 --> 00:10:29.150
It's just about to be
her second anniversary

00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:31.370
as librarian September 14th.

00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:33.880
So I think we should
have a round of applause

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:35.680
and congratulations to her.

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:44.040
[ Applause ]

00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:47.610
Dr. Billington, Secretary Chao,
so many distinguished guests

00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:50.180
and friends in this room.

00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:54.230
I am so grateful for this
award, it's hard for me

00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:56.970
to find the words
to convey that.

00:10:56.970 --> 00:11:00.700
And also to convey how
humble I feel to be

00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:04.720
in the pantheon of
its recipients.

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:08.130
I'm delighted to be awarded
this recognition by the Library

00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:11.250
of Congress, an institution
that has meant so much

00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:14.510
to me throughout my
scholarly career.

00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:18.830
From the papers of 19th-century
South Carolina congressman

00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:22.350
and senator James Henry
Hammond, a key figure

00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:26.130
in my first two books, to
the diaries and letters

00:11:26.130 --> 00:11:30.730
of Clara Barton and the searing
Matthew Brady photographs

00:11:30.730 --> 00:11:33.180
so central to my last.

00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:35.860
The library's collections
have been essential

00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:40.200
to my explorations of the
history of the American South

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:44.290
and the nation's
experience of Civil War.

00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:46.870
That this award comes
from the Library

00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:51.650
of Congress is a signal
honor that it is awarded

00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:54.120
for achievement in the study

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:59.950
of humanity is a recognition I
could scarcely have dreamed of.

00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:05.510
It affirms what I have seen
as a vocation, a calling,

00:12:05.510 --> 00:12:11.130
a life purpose both in my
own dedication to such study

00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:15.010
but also in my efforts on
behalf of the institutions,

00:12:15.010 --> 00:12:18.500
especially universities
that have enabled

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:21.850
and encouraged this pursuit.

00:12:21.850 --> 00:12:24.120
The path I've chosen
into the study

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:27.170
of humanity has been history.

00:12:27.170 --> 00:12:31.210
From my earliest years which
I guess I discussed already a

00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:33.760
little bit on the video, growing

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:37.090
up in Virginia's Shenandoah
Valley in the 1950's

00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:42.520
and 60's I felt the presence
of the past all around me.

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:48.580
I lived on a farm on the Lee
Jackson Highway amidst fields

00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:52.400
where Confederates and
Yankees had skirmished,

00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:55.170
and I played Civil
War with my brothers

00:12:55.170 --> 00:12:57.990
in the woods near our house.

00:12:57.990 --> 00:13:01.840
But I also knew even
as a young child

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:07.350
that my own era was a
historic time in its own right,

00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:11.710
one of controversy and challenge
to the entrenched order

00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:17.730
of segregation that had replaced
slavery after the Civil War.

00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:21.000
History seemed to
surround me even

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:26.350
as a new history was being
created before my eyes.

00:13:26.350 --> 00:13:32.090
The past of slavery, war and
racial injustice so present

00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:35.900
in my childhood would
later become the focus

00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:37.290
of my scholarly work.

00:13:37.290 --> 00:13:40.620
But the questions I would ask

00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:43.770
of the 19th century
had implications

00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:45.740
for my own world as well.

00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:49.640
I sought through
research and writing

00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:53.380
to understand how
human beings had come

00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:57.850
to create the slave
society of the old South

00:13:57.850 --> 00:14:02.710
and how slavery's oppressions
had become for millions

00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:08.150
of white Southerners not
just an accepted way of life

00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:11.800
but what they justified
as a positive good,

00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:14.660
and what ultimately
in the hundreds

00:14:14.660 --> 00:14:18.660
of thousands they
died to defend.

00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:22.850
A century later I had
grown up amongst adults

00:14:22.850 --> 00:14:26.580
who supported segregation,
a system that had seemed

00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:30.630
to me even as a young child
at odds with the Democratic

00:14:30.630 --> 00:14:36.830
and Christian values those same
adults taught me to espouse.

00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:40.150
If I could understand
the southern past,

00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:45.920
perhaps I could better
understand the southern present.

00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:49.560
My PhD dissertation
and my first book were

00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:52.640
about the proslavery argument.

00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:58.040
You might say I wanted to
understand inhumanity, how men

00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:01.780
and women throughout history
have persuaded themselves

00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:08.640
to defend ideas, practices,
societies, governments that we

00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:13.210
of a different era
see as indefensible.

00:15:13.210 --> 00:15:19.010
I wanted to know how humans
can become blind to evil.

00:15:19.010 --> 00:15:23.630
Perhaps if we could understand
their processes of denial

00:15:23.630 --> 00:15:27.840
and rationalization,
we might gain insight

00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:30.990
into our own failures of vision,

00:15:30.990 --> 00:15:34.860
the shortcomings
of our own time.

00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:37.300
History in other words,

00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:42.100
can expand our awareness
of ourselves.

00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:47.930
It releases us from the confines
of our own individual lives.

00:15:47.930 --> 00:15:51.050
It offers us other
ways of seeing

00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:55.400
that cast our assumptions
into relief.

00:15:55.400 --> 00:16:00.810
It reminds us of choices
people have made or not made

00:16:00.810 --> 00:16:05.450
and thus it illuminates
realms of possibility.

00:16:05.450 --> 00:16:10.840
It shows us that things have
been otherwise and it reminds us

00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:15.180
that things can be
different once again.

00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:17.910
By documenting contingency

00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:22.980
and agency history
undermines any acceptance

00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:26.420
of crippling inevitability.

00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:30.280
And contingency means
opportunity,

00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:36.710
it means we can change things
and that what we do matters.

00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:42.490
To my mind this is history's
most important lesson.

00:16:42.490 --> 00:16:45.480
Although I had first focused
on my attention on the society

00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:49.000
and culture of the old
South the implications

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.680
of the questions I was
exploring in my writing

00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:57.120
and teaching led me
inexorably toward the Civil War.

00:16:57.120 --> 00:17:03.200
It seemed I had been steeped in
that war from my earliest days.

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:08.460
As I began my deeper scholarly
explorations into its history,

00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:12.800
I soon came to understand
Ernest Hemingway's observation

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:15.490
to F. Scott Fitzgerald.

00:17:15.490 --> 00:17:20.530
War he said is the best subject.

00:17:20.530 --> 00:17:25.450
For me it proved irresistible
to study humanity when it is

00:17:25.450 --> 00:17:28.100
under maximum pressure.

00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:32.060
When decisions and choices
are literally matters

00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:34.410
of life and death.

00:17:34.410 --> 00:17:38.820
When the possibility for the
best of humanity, courage,

00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:44.790
sacrifice and the worst of
humanity cruelly, cruelty,

00:17:44.790 --> 00:17:48.700
brutality when they collide.

00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:52.190
And I found myself drawn to
explore with my students,

00:17:52.190 --> 00:17:55.810
other wars as well
Vietnam, the two world wars,

00:17:55.810 --> 00:17:59.140
what was different
and what unchanging

00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:04.100
about the human response to
combat and conflagration.

00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:08.000
What was the product of
time and circumstance

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:13.400
and what was the result of an
essential and enduring humanity?

00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:18.580
How did the inhumanity of
war compel its participants

00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:24.750
to reaffirm and reassert
what humanity truly meant?

00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:28.490
And how did war extend
beyond the battlefield

00:18:28.490 --> 00:18:30.740
to engulf the lives
of civilians,

00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:33.150
of women and of children?

00:18:33.150 --> 00:18:38.430
What as we might put it
was the human face of war?

00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:42.720
It was in war's foregrounding
of death

00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:47.150
that I encountered an
unparalleled line of sight

00:18:47.150 --> 00:18:53.320
into the human condition and the
subject for my most recent book.

00:18:53.320 --> 00:19:00.230
Mortality is a defining feature
of humanity and our recognition

00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:02.230
and anticipation

00:19:02.230 --> 00:19:07.410
of our inevitable end is a
key element differentiating us

00:19:07.410 --> 00:19:09.510
from animals.

00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:11.370
All of life and all

00:19:11.370 --> 00:19:14.960
of philosophy Montaigne
once observed is

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:17.700
about learning to die.

00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:20.820
Yet we do so in different ways,

00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:24.580
in different eras,
and different places.

00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:28.810
Facing the unprecedented
slaughter of Civil War more

00:19:28.810 --> 00:19:32.490
than 2% of the population
died in the course of the war,

00:19:32.490 --> 00:19:36.990
the equivalent of about
7 million people today.

00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:42.200
Americans confronted death
in a manner both old and new.

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:44.550
The widely shared
Christian ideology

00:19:44.550 --> 00:19:48.620
of the good death provided
lessons in how to die

00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:52.050
that shaped the response
to unimaginable

00:19:52.050 --> 00:19:57.110
and unfathomable
industrialized slaughter.

00:19:57.110 --> 00:19:59.980
The insistence of
our forebearers

00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:03.200
on adapting the rituals
and practices

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:07.120
that preserve their
humanity, even in the face

00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:11.910
of catastrophe seem to me
an affirmation of the power

00:20:11.910 --> 00:20:15.390
and resilience of
the human spirit.

00:20:15.390 --> 00:20:19.400
Even in almost impossible
circumstances soldiers

00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:24.990
and civilians alike struggled
to bury name and honor the dead

00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:29.670
in ways that affirm the
value of each human life.

00:20:29.670 --> 00:20:31.910
The national cemetery
system that emerged

00:20:31.910 --> 00:20:33.960
from the war represents
the expression

00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:38.190
of this impulse on
a national level.

00:20:38.190 --> 00:20:42.840
For me the research and
writing for this book served

00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:47.450
as an excursion into the
past with powerful resonance

00:20:47.450 --> 00:20:50.790
for a future that awaits us all.

00:20:50.790 --> 00:20:54.390
I have been deeply moved
and gratified to learn

00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:58.870
that readers ranging from
hospice workers to clergy

00:20:58.870 --> 00:21:03.450
to active and veteran military
have found this book has spoken

00:21:03.450 --> 00:21:07.380
to them and to their experience.

00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:10.940
That is just a brief glimpse
into what the study of humanity

00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:16.090
and inhumanity has meant for
me and the kinds of questions

00:21:16.090 --> 00:21:18.950
that collections like the
ones here at the Library

00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:22.780
of Congress have
enabled me to ask.

00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:27.150
Other institutions have of
course also supported this work

00:21:27.150 --> 00:21:29.490
which would never
have been accomplished

00:21:29.490 --> 00:21:33.210
without the rich intellectual
environment of teaching

00:21:33.210 --> 00:21:38.610
and research nurtured by
American higher education.

00:21:38.610 --> 00:21:43.200
Universities have served as the
locus for humanistic inquiry

00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:47.450
from the time of their
founding in the 11th century.

00:21:47.450 --> 00:21:50.860
Society has assigned
primary responsibility

00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:54.200
for this stewardship to them.

00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:57.430
It has been the unique
role of the university both

00:21:57.430 --> 00:22:01.190
to serve the immediate
and urgent present

00:22:01.190 --> 00:22:04.250
and at the same time
to look beyond it

00:22:04.250 --> 00:22:08.530
to pose larger questions
of meaning.

00:22:08.530 --> 00:22:12.420
Not just to propel
us towards our goals

00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:16.340
but to ask what those
goals should be.

00:22:16.340 --> 00:22:21.430
To understand who we
are, where we came from,

00:22:21.430 --> 00:22:25.640
and where we are going and why.

00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:30.250
Yet we find ourselves in a time
when the value and legitimacy

00:22:30.250 --> 00:22:32.530
of these questions
and of the fields

00:22:32.530 --> 00:22:35.840
that embody them are
being criticized,

00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:38.680
weakened, marginalized.

00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:44.420
Increasingly education is seen
as instrumental, we expect it

00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:49.380
to provide a direct
path to a specific job.

00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:54.720
We fail to ask how it will
produce a thoughtful citizen

00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:57.900
or a person who can
imagine beyond the moment

00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:00.380
in which we find
ourselves to see

00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:03.660
and build the changing
world ahead.

00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:05.820
Or how I can build a
leader who can begin

00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:08.830
to address the profound impact

00:23:08.830 --> 00:23:12.380
of our extraordinary
technological advances

00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:16.650
on our culture or society
and our very understanding

00:23:16.650 --> 00:23:19.570
of what it is to be human.

00:23:19.570 --> 00:23:24.710
We see the results of this
neglect all around us.

00:23:24.710 --> 00:23:29.560
We have invented the marvels
of social media but not figured

00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:34.960
out the ethics of the
profound challenges it poses.

00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:39.010
We have made torrents
of information available

00:23:39.010 --> 00:23:43.800
to almost everyone but not
equipped them with the skills

00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:49.200
of analysis and habits of
discernment to separate truth

00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:53.280
from falsehood or perhaps
most alarmingly to believe

00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:56.810
that this distinction matters.

00:23:56.810 --> 00:24:03.060
We are a society enthralled
by the notion of innovation.

00:24:03.060 --> 00:24:06.280
But how can we imagine
a new future

00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:10.340
without grasping how
things were once different

00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:13.030
and can be different again.

00:24:13.030 --> 00:24:18.790
We are witnessing sharp declines
in the fields designed to ask

00:24:18.790 --> 00:24:22.530
such questions and
nurture such skills.

00:24:22.530 --> 00:24:26.130
I speak of course of the
humanities and what are known

00:24:26.130 --> 00:24:30.580
as the qualitative not
mathematical social sciences,

00:24:30.580 --> 00:24:35.710
languages, literatures,
history, philosophy, religion,

00:24:35.710 --> 00:24:39.230
anthropology, parts
of sociology,

00:24:39.230 --> 00:24:44.390
and political science are at
the core of this endeavor.

00:24:44.390 --> 00:24:46.460
And their departments, majors,

00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:50.020
jobs and enrollments
are plummeting.

00:24:50.020 --> 00:24:54.220
At Penn State for example,
the five years from 2010

00:24:54.220 --> 00:25:00.030
to 2015 saw a 40% decline
in humanities majors.

00:25:00.030 --> 00:25:01.840
At the University of Illinois

00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:06.430
at Champaign Urbana there
were 414 English majors

00:25:06.430 --> 00:25:13.760
in 2005 and 155 in 2015.

00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:20.730
Nationwide numbers of history
majors are down 45% since 2007.

00:25:20.730 --> 00:25:25.780
Since the 1990's English
majors have declined by half.

00:25:25.780 --> 00:25:28.540
The University of Wisconsin

00:25:28.540 --> 00:25:32.910
at Stevens Point announced it
would abolish 13 departments,

00:25:32.910 --> 00:25:36.380
including French, German,
Spanish, philosophy

00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:38.900
and political science.

00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:43.720
One state governor listed the
specific fields to be favored

00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:49.130
with state support explicitly
tying educational resources

00:25:49.130 --> 00:25:51.760
to job outcomes.

00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:56.360
He said I want to spend our
dollars giving people sciences,

00:25:56.360 --> 00:26:00.250
technology, engineering, math
degrees so that when they get

00:26:00.250 --> 00:26:02.620
out of school, they
can get a job.

00:26:02.620 --> 00:26:05.220
He observed that his
state did not need any

00:26:05.220 --> 00:26:08.310
more anthropologists.

00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:11.850
In fact humanists do get jobs

00:26:11.850 --> 00:26:16.130
and over a lifetime earn only
slightly less than their peers

00:26:16.130 --> 00:26:19.110
in the social and
natural sciences.

00:26:19.110 --> 00:26:24.830
Jobs are of course important
but they are not enough to serve

00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:29.740
as the exclusive purpose
of higher education.

00:26:29.740 --> 00:26:33.050
When we define the role
of learning as solely

00:26:33.050 --> 00:26:37.990
to drive economic development,
we risk losing sight

00:26:37.990 --> 00:26:42.060
of the broader and deeper
questions of the kinds

00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:46.270
of inquiry that enable
the critical insight

00:26:46.270 --> 00:26:49.540
that built the humane
perspective,

00:26:49.540 --> 00:26:52.320
that foster the restless
skepticism

00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:54.410
and unbounded curiosity

00:26:54.410 --> 00:26:59.560
from which our profoundest
understandings so often emerge.

00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:03.500
We shouldn't forget
Einstein's words, not everything

00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:07.670
that counts can be counted
and that not everything

00:27:07.670 --> 00:27:10.350
that can be counted counts.

00:27:10.350 --> 00:27:13.430
It seems to me telling
that one set

00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:16.980
of higher education
institutions has not shared

00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:21.160
in this recent decline in the
importance of the humanities.

00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:23.870
These are our military
academies,

00:27:23.870 --> 00:27:26.890
take the example of West Point.

00:27:26.890 --> 00:27:28.190
From its origins

00:27:28.190 --> 00:27:31.940
as an engineering school the
United States Military Academy

00:27:31.940 --> 00:27:36.350
has evolved over two centuries
to be a very special sort

00:27:36.350 --> 00:27:41.050
of liberal arts college, one
that recognizes that many

00:27:41.050 --> 00:27:43.990
of the most significant
lessons it can impart

00:27:43.990 --> 00:27:49.550
for leadership must emerge
from the study of humanity.

00:27:49.550 --> 00:27:52.860
The Academy describes it
this way, the expansion

00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:58.160
of a person's capacity to know
oneself and view the world

00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:00.960
through multiple lenses.

00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:04.760
The distinguished Academy
graduate General George Patton

00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:08.980
whose papers are here at the
Library of Congress insisted

00:28:08.980 --> 00:28:13.490
that a successful
soldier must know history.

00:28:13.490 --> 00:28:19.580
To win battles he observed you
do not need weapons you beat the

00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:22.740
soul of man.

00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:26.760
Alexander the Great slept with
two things under his pillow,

00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:31.970
a dagger and a copy
of Homer's Iliad.

00:28:31.970 --> 00:28:37.930
To understand the human soul,
no small aspiration but one

00:28:37.930 --> 00:28:41.520
that has propelled my work
for decades and the work

00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:44.770
of the humanities for millennia.

00:28:44.770 --> 00:28:48.640
In identifying what is
distinctively human we

00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:50.620
necessarily commit ourselves

00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:53.860
to its preservation
and enhancement.

00:28:53.860 --> 00:28:56.400
To the appreciation of
what unites us rather

00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:59.430
than the distraction
of what divides us.

00:28:59.430 --> 00:29:02.670
To the advancement of
the humane in a world

00:29:02.670 --> 00:29:06.790
that often seems bent
on destroying it.

00:29:06.790 --> 00:29:10.400
We must support universities
in their dedication

00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:15.130
to these efforts and we
must adopt a discourse

00:29:15.130 --> 00:29:16.540
that honors rather

00:29:16.540 --> 00:29:20.380
than disparaging these
fields of inquiry.

00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:24.070
But to make this
possible and sustainable

00:29:24.070 --> 00:29:29.270
within universities we must
also build broader understanding

00:29:29.270 --> 00:29:30.960
of the importance of the study

00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:35.080
of humanity outside
and beyond them.

00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:38.150
And so let me return
to where I began,

00:29:38.150 --> 00:29:41.930
to where we find
ourselves tonight.

00:29:41.930 --> 00:29:43.580
In serving as the Library

00:29:43.580 --> 00:29:48.870
of Congress this institution
must also serve all the people

00:29:48.870 --> 00:29:51.340
that Congress represents.

00:29:51.340 --> 00:29:55.580
Not just scholars but
the curious citizens

00:29:55.580 --> 00:29:58.280
of an entire nation.

00:29:58.280 --> 00:30:01.740
All of us are in this
room because we are

00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:05.390
in some way connected
to that work.

00:30:05.390 --> 00:30:10.840
Because we are somehow
invested in that endeavor.

00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:14.090
The extraordinary advances
of science and technology

00:30:14.090 --> 00:30:18.070
that lie before us
must be shaped by human

00:30:18.070 --> 00:30:21.510
and humane purposes
if those values

00:30:21.510 --> 00:30:26.660
and perhaps even humankind
are not to be destroyed.

00:30:26.660 --> 00:30:30.420
Let me invoke the historian
sense of contingency

00:30:30.420 --> 00:30:33.370
that I earlier described.

00:30:33.370 --> 00:30:37.320
It is up to us to
define the nature

00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:41.140
and quality of human
possibility.

00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:45.710
The contents of this
library can help inspire us

00:30:45.710 --> 00:30:51.110
to inspire others to understand
what those possibilities

00:30:51.110 --> 00:30:52.410
might be.

00:30:52.410 --> 00:30:56.270
Let me make this
point by closing

00:30:56.270 --> 00:30:59.480
with a treasure from
the library.

00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:03.310
I spoke earlier of
the face of war.

00:31:03.310 --> 00:31:06.540
The Library of Congress
possesses a remarkable

00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:12.330
collection of I understand now
more than 3,500 Civil War faces

00:31:12.330 --> 00:31:17.130
that has been assembled and
donated by Tom Liljenquist

00:31:17.130 --> 00:31:21.070
who is here in the audience
and his three young sons.

00:31:21.070 --> 00:31:24.870
Inspired by newspaper
photographs of US servicemen

00:31:24.870 --> 00:31:26.920
and servicewomen killed in Iraq

00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:30.820
and Afghanistan the Liljenquists
regard their collection

00:31:30.820 --> 00:31:34.230
of tintypes and ambrotypes
as a memorial

00:31:34.230 --> 00:31:37.370
to the soldiers of
the Civil War.

00:31:37.370 --> 00:31:41.550
This gives you a general
portrait but here is one

00:31:41.550 --> 00:31:45.510
of the ambrotypes
from the collection.

00:31:45.510 --> 00:31:50.730
It's been tentatively identified
as Sergeant Samuel Smith,

00:31:50.730 --> 00:31:55.260
his wife Molly and
daughters Mary and Maggie.

00:31:55.260 --> 00:31:59.000
The image was found in Cecil
County, Maryland so it's likely

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:02.880
that this soldier was in
one of seven regiments

00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:08.120
of United States colored
troops raised in that state.

00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:10.110
Like all of the portraits

00:32:10.110 --> 00:32:14.080
in this collection it
speaks eloquently to us

00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:17.600
across the century and a
half that separates us.

00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:24.530
For this soldier and his family
the message is one of pride

00:32:24.530 --> 00:32:29.480
and affirmation of the new
freedoms war had enabled him

00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:31.290
to claim.

00:32:31.290 --> 00:32:35.510
Slavery would have denied him
the right to legally marry

00:32:35.510 --> 00:32:40.150
or to protect his wife
and children from sale.

00:32:40.150 --> 00:32:45.880
This portrait is of a free
man, it proclaims a new day

00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:50.940
for black families, a new
respectability of fine clothing,

00:32:50.940 --> 00:32:55.210
and of daughters in
matching coats and bonnets.

00:32:55.210 --> 00:32:59.510
And it portrays a soldier,
an African-American

00:32:59.510 --> 00:33:04.190
who under slavery would've been
prohibited from bearing arms,

00:33:04.190 --> 00:33:10.690
and who until 1863 could not
have enlisted in the Army.

00:33:10.690 --> 00:33:15.030
Now he has joined what would
be nearly 200,000 other black

00:33:15.030 --> 00:33:21.780
Americans to fight for freedom,
to risk enslavement if captured,

00:33:21.780 --> 00:33:26.900
and to establish a claim to
full citizenship and humanity

00:33:26.900 --> 00:33:30.910
as the republic's old defenders.

00:33:30.910 --> 00:33:33.360
In this photograph
Sergeant Smith

00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:37.510
or whoever this might
be makes a statement

00:33:37.510 --> 00:33:40.970
about a new order of things.

00:33:40.970 --> 00:33:45.630
It is his own declaration
of independence,

00:33:45.630 --> 00:33:48.820
his personal affirmation
that all men

00:33:48.820 --> 00:33:54.910
that he has been created
equal, that he is fighting

00:33:54.910 --> 00:33:58.100
for a new birth of freedom.

00:33:58.100 --> 00:34:01.710
But these 3,500 portraits
and thousands more

00:34:01.710 --> 00:34:08.350
like them are intended to send
us another message as well,

00:34:08.350 --> 00:34:12.850
one that speaks directly to the
meaning of the study of humanity

00:34:12.850 --> 00:34:16.070
across time and space.

00:34:16.070 --> 00:34:20.790
These soldiers staring into
the photographer's lens are

00:34:20.790 --> 00:34:25.110
self-consciously
reaching through history.

00:34:25.110 --> 00:34:28.410
They are documenting their
faces and their uniforms partly

00:34:28.410 --> 00:34:32.990
because they know they may be
killed in the battles ahead.

00:34:32.990 --> 00:34:37.970
But they also know they are
making history in this war

00:34:37.970 --> 00:34:41.200
and they want to
capture that for us.

00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:46.530
Attention must be paid they
are saying, don't forget

00:34:46.530 --> 00:34:50.640
who we were and what we did.

00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:54.610
Let us give you the
means to see us,

00:34:54.610 --> 00:35:00.110
to understand us long
after we are gone.

00:35:00.110 --> 00:35:05.150
Our present is delivered
to us at a price paid

00:35:05.150 --> 00:35:08.070
by those who came before.

00:35:08.070 --> 00:35:13.010
History helps us remember
our accountability to them,

00:35:13.010 --> 00:35:18.000
as well as our obligations
to more than just ourselves

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:22.250
and more than just our own time.

00:35:22.250 --> 00:35:25.280
It is a way of knowing
and valuing

00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:28.050
that has never mattered more.

00:35:28.050 --> 00:35:29.850
Thank you very much.

00:35:29.850 --> 00:36:08.040
[ Applause ]

00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:10.680
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: Thank you for
those aspiring words Dr. Faust

00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:13.390
and all of us at the library
look forward to working

00:36:13.390 --> 00:36:14.890
with you in the future.

00:36:14.890 --> 00:36:16.810
I know I can speak
for all of us on that.

00:36:16.810 --> 00:36:21.460
And I now invite everybody
to make your way upstairs

00:36:21.460 --> 00:36:25.510
for dinner, and thank you again.

00:36:25.510 --> 00:36:31.080
