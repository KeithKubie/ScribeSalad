00:00:01.101 --> 00:00:02.668
Here's the thing. We love to act
like all these good cops

00:00:02.701 --> 00:00:05.338
just gonna all step up
and do the right thing together.

00:00:05.371 --> 00:00:07.206
Please, most people
don't do the right thing

00:00:07.239 --> 00:00:08.408
for the right reason.

00:00:08.441 --> 00:00:10.577
They do the right thing
for the right price.

00:00:11.377 --> 00:00:14.480
I promise you if you started
giving cops $100,000 to snitch

00:00:14.513 --> 00:00:15.481
on other cops

00:00:15.514 --> 00:00:18.218
they would be arresting
each other at roll call.

00:00:19.151 --> 00:00:20.820
You wouldn't even make it
out of the police station

00:00:20.853 --> 00:00:22.288
in the morning.

00:00:22.321 --> 00:00:24.624
"Put your hands up, Sanchez."

00:00:29.628 --> 00:00:32.599
Something's going on,
don't know how to explain it.

00:00:33.499 --> 00:00:36.336
Things are just different
around the department.

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:41.808
That's not mine,
that's not mine.

00:00:41.841 --> 00:00:43.176
Y'all planted that shit.

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:44.377
Possession with intent.

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:45.645
Come on, I've got a family, man.

00:00:45.678 --> 00:00:47.580
Cops are just going missing.

00:00:48.314 --> 00:00:50.316
Do the honors.

00:00:55.387 --> 00:00:57.123
Hey, what are you doing, man?
He's one of us.

00:00:57.156 --> 00:00:59.492
Yeah, that's what you get
for planting evidence.

00:01:00.226 --> 00:01:03.830
They just disappearing. But why?

00:01:03.863 --> 00:01:05.799
You keep snitching on
dirty cops,

00:01:06.632 --> 00:01:08.635
I'll keep paying you.

00:01:20.212 --> 00:01:23.716
I know this much: whoever doing
all this snitching,

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:25.518
can't be happy with himself.

00:01:26.852 --> 00:01:28.221
I found your drug money.

00:01:28.254 --> 00:01:29.422
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

00:01:29.455 --> 00:01:30.723
- Bunny...
- What is it?

00:01:30.756 --> 00:01:33.192
It's not drug money.
Just let me-

00:01:33.225 --> 00:01:34.794
You brought drug money
into my house?

00:01:34.827 --> 00:01:36.796
I been snitching, okay?
I snitch on dirty cops.

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:38.865
I snitched on Taylor, Jenkins, 

00:01:38.898 --> 00:01:41.134
Cavanity. I snitched on Jimmy

00:01:41.167 --> 00:01:44.203
that work in the parking deck.
They pay me good money to do it.

00:01:44.236 --> 00:01:45.771
They pay you this much
to snitch?

00:01:45.804 --> 00:01:48.842
I wasn't gonna tell you 'cause
I was afraid of losing you.

00:01:50.376 --> 00:01:52.112
Are y'all hiring?

00:01:58.951 --> 00:02:00.686
You know what you're
getting yourself into?

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.788
Cops who go against the force
to do the right thing,

00:02:02.821 --> 00:02:04.790
aren't rewarded
by their department.

00:02:04.823 --> 00:02:07.493
They're punished.
No promotions.

00:02:07.526 --> 00:02:09.395
Assigned to the worst
neighborhoods.

00:02:09.428 --> 00:02:11.764
And when your life is on the
line, you're dead today.

00:02:12.932 --> 00:02:14.300
Officer needs assistance.
I'm in a alley off Third.

00:02:14.333 --> 00:02:15.935
Help me, dangit!

00:02:15.968 --> 00:02:18.538
No back up,
snitches on their own.

00:02:30.649 --> 00:02:35.321
Oh, he one of the good ones.
Come on, we out.

00:02:35.354 --> 00:02:38.424
I tell you this much: if I find
out who snitch,

00:02:39.425 --> 00:02:43.897
I'm gonna kill his ass.

00:02:45.364 --> 00:02:47.433
I'm with you on that, brother.

00:02:47.466 --> 00:02:49.535
Babe, I bought
two new black stallions.

00:02:49.568 --> 00:02:51.337
What's all this about?

00:02:52.338 --> 00:02:53.907
She undercover
at the horse track.

00:03:00.246 --> 00:03:02.248
Cool. Alright, then,
see y'all later.

00:03:02.281 --> 00:03:06.252
That was close.
I'll catch you at the stable.

00:03:06.285 --> 00:03:08.821
Okay, baby. I'll see you. Shit.

00:03:13.792 --> 00:03:15.562
Boy about to get paid!
