TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hello, and
welcome back to "Google

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:11.760
Developers Live." I'm Timothy
Jordan here at Google I/O. And

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.840
I'm sitting with a few friends
who built something

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.780
really fun for Glass.

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.610
Now, the reason we brought these
guys up here is because

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:23.330
I think the story is so cool.

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.170
And it's cool for a number
of different reasons.

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:29.070
The first one is that these
three guys are from three

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.030
different parts of
the country.

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:35.340
They all got together at our
Glass Foundry here in San

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.890
Francisco, built some really
cool Glassware,

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:40.720
and won first prize.

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.510
Not only that, the Glassware
that they built was based on

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:44.980
fun and having a good time.

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.380
It's the first game that
we have for Glass.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.710
And I just wanted to talk about
that in more detail.

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:52.920
I think we should go through
and just have you guys

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.240
introduce yourselves.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.850
And how about this?

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:57.780
Throw in, also, what's your
favorite thing about the

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:58.530
Mirror API?

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:59.720
Let's start with Song.

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:00.590
SONG ZHENG: Awesome.

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:02.540
My name is Song, and
I'm a developer

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.530
evangelist at TokBox.

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.530
And I've been playing around
with the Mirror API ever since

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:08.220
the Hackathon.

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.190
And what I really like
about it is that it's

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:12.250
very easy to use.

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:13.090
It's RESTful.

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.440
And there's a lot of client
support, so it doesn't matter

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:16.630
which language you're using.

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.240
There is support for it.

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.850
TIMOTHY JORDAN: And Jonathan.

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.190
JONATHAN GOTTFRIED: Hey, I'm
Jon Gottfried, and I'm a

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:24.260
developer evangelist
at Twilio.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.280
And I've really enjoyed the
fact that the Mirror API

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.930
allows me to develop an
application and not have to

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:31.810
worry about the client, right?

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.780
I can assume that my application
is going to run as

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.930
expected because of
how it interacts

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.230
with the Glass device.

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.930
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Awesome.

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:39.820
And Rajiv.

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:40.380
RAJIV MAKHIJANI: Hi.

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.550
I'm Rajiv Makhijani.

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:43.150
I'm a software developer
at Hulu.

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:45.950
And I think the Glass API is
really cool because it lets

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.870
you develop what essentially
feels like a client

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.310
application the same way
you develop a web app.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.520
So that you can release updates,
make changes, and

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.330
really affect it without having
to worry about software

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.330
updates or anything like that.

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.770
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That's cool.

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.760
Before we start talking about
"Icebreaker" in more detail--

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.870
now, if you're playing the home
game and you'd like to

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.630
check out "Icebreaker,"
go to icebreaker.io.

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.280
It's going to be a lot more fun
if you're here at Google

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.300
I/O with Glass, but if you'd
like to take a look at their

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.160
cool graphics and see what
it's about, you can

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.820
play along that way.

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:17.250
Let's talk in more detail
about that.

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.430
But before we do, let's talk
about developing for Glass.

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.390
Now, what I think is crazy about
what you guys did was,

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.430
we had this conversation
a few weeks back,

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:28.850
wouldn't it be cool if.

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.690
We took what you guys built
for Glass Foundry, and

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.330
expanded it to a game that
people with Glass at I/O could

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.150
play, and could use to
meet each other.

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.730
And then you went off and
running developing.

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.540
And it was just a really
fast iteration process.

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.260
And I believe you're
still submitting

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.600
code, making it better.

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.055
Now, what is it about
the Mirror API--

00:02:50.055 --> 00:02:51.540
FEMALE SPEAKER: I just
came by to say hi.

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.870
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hello.

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:52.520
FEMALE SPEAKER: You're going
to have a great show.

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.924
TIMOTHY JORDAN: You're live
on I/O, you know.

00:02:54.924 --> 00:02:55.392
FEMALE SPEAKER: I'm not.

00:02:55.392 --> 00:02:56.328
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Yes, you are.

00:02:56.328 --> 00:02:59.136
FEMALE SPEAKER: I know
that I'm not, no.

00:02:59.136 --> 00:02:59.604
Am I?

00:02:59.604 --> 00:03:00.072
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Yes.

00:03:00.072 --> 00:03:00.720
FEMALE SPEAKER: Oh my god.

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:01.530
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Just say hi.

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:02.140
It's OK.

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.602
FEMALE SPEAKER: Hey.

00:03:02.602 --> 00:03:03.526
Hey.

00:03:03.526 --> 00:03:07.230
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.850
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That's going
to go down in history.

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:11.310
All right.

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:17.850
So back to what is it about
the Mirror API that makes

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.700
doing that kind of development,
that fast

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:24.510
iteration, and that fly by the
wire development so effective?

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:29.920
SONG ZHENG: So what
do you think, Jon?

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.860
JONATHAN GOTTFRIED: I think that
the interesting thing is

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.170
what Rajiv mentioned earlier,
that the Mirror API is really

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.090
a client application that you're
developing in the style

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:39.560
of a web application.

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.340
So we are deploying code in Ruby
and Python that runs on a

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:44.550
web server.

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:47.900
And the device simply connects
to it in a natural way that we

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.440
don't have to worry about.

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.180
So we can write our code and
deploy as often as we like,

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.450
and as often as we need to,
without having to interact

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.450
with the devices themselves.

00:03:58.450 --> 00:03:59.810
We don't have to
push an update.

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:01.830
We don't have to have the
user do anything.

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:04.950
We can just write the code,
deploy it to our server, and

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:06.390
they will have the
latest version.

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:09.450
And it's really, really one of
the things I love about web

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:10.000
development.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.920
And it's awesome to see that
ported to a client device.

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.130
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That's cool.

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:14.760
All right.

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:15.432
SONG ZHENG: I--

00:04:15.432 --> 00:04:15.770
can I add to that?

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:16.420
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Do you want
to add something?

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.910
Go for it.

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:19.920
SONG ZHENG: I just wanted to say
that the Mirror API, being

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:23.430
RESTful and all, really fits the
model of the whole concept

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:24.680
of timeline.

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.940
So you have a whole timeline
on your Google Glass.

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.260
When you send a post request,
you create a timeline.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:34.910
And if you send an update
request, it updates it.

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:37.340
Working with the Mirror API,
it's something that you

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.020
understand right away, so you
don't have to do a whole

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:44.900
paradigm shift and learn an
entire new framework.

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.430
The whole concept of Mirror API
was very natural and easy

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:49.990
to pick up.

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.780
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Awesome.

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:51.030
OK.

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:53.185
Let's talk about the game.

00:04:53.185 --> 00:04:56.230
And I think this is really
important, because Glass is

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:57.675
great for productivity.

00:04:57.675 --> 00:04:59.290
It's great for sending email.

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:01.750
And there's also a lot of fun
stuff you can do on Glass,

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:04.540
like getting updates, and
sending pictures to my friends

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:06.600
on Google+.

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.910
But what I love about
"Icebreaker," it's just so

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:10.860
filled with whimsy.

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:11.270
Yeah?

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:15.040
I mean, you have a really good
time playing the game and

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.220
meeting new people
at the same time.

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:19.490
Rajiv, do you want to talk a
little bit about where that

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:22.940
idea came from, and why
it works at I/O?

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:23.660
RAJIV MAKHIJANI: Sure, yeah.

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:25.570
So the game kind of started
in a different place.

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:28.010
Originally, we were trying to
model what we were building

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:29.450
off of the game of "Assassins,"
because we

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:31.150
thought it would be cool
to use Glass to do

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:32.030
something like that.

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:34.330
And later we realized that,
hey, this is actually an

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:37.110
opportunity to be both a game
and also a way to meet people.

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:40.400
So that Glass isn't just about
productivity and receiving

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.710
notifications about different
information happening, but

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:44.770
it's also a way to meet other
people around you and actually

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:46.610
keep you more in touch with the
real world, rather than

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:48.940
sucking you back into your
electronic devices.

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:50.060
So we thought that would
be really cool

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:51.670
way to approach it.

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:51.890
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That's great.

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:55.630
And what I love about that is
that Glass isn't about being

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:57.020
immersed in a device.

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:00.060
It's about connecting you more
with the people and places

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:00.730
around you.

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:02.430
And I think "Icebreaker"
does that really well.

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:03.580
JONATHAN GOTTFRIED: And I think
that while we're in the

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:06.400
Explorer program, it's a very
tight-knit group that's

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:09.140
already collaborating online,
and already having all of

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:12.320
these interactions within
the developer community.

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:14.670
And it's awesome to
kind of transmit

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:16.280
that to the real world.

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:18.470
It's already a small, tight-knit
group of people,

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:22.330
and it's awesome to see them
meet and interact in person.

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:24.040
SONG ZHENG: If I have Google
Glass, and you're wearing

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:25.600
Google Glass, we have
something in

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:26.470
common right away.

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:29.560
We're both passionate about
technology, right?

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:32.260
So why not build an app that
brings all our interests

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:35.680
together, so that you meet
another person who also has

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:38.710
the same passion for technology
that you have and

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:40.480
build a whole community
like that.

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:43.600
And as Glass expands, the
community expands, and

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:46.740
everybody becomes
one big family.

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:48.020
TIMOTHY JORDAN: I like that.

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:50.470
Now, you've been at our Sandbox
over there in the

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:53.090
Glass booth, which means
you've been demoing.

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:55.060
People have been coming up
and asking you questions.

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:57.760
And you probably also got some
people with Glass who have

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:00.250
started using "Icebreaker."
How is it going at the

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:00.890
conference?

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:01.770
Are people using it?

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:02.610
Are they meeting each other?

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:03.720
RAJIV MAKHIJANI: Yeah,
it's been great.

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:06.280
I mean, initially there was a
little bit of Wi-Fi problems,

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:08.030
but I think people have really
started picking up

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:09.680
and playing the game.

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:11.650
We've seen a lot of people
actually find

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:12.720
people and meet people.

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:14.360
And a lot of people who get
really excited about it,

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:17.350
because it's one of the few
interactive things you can do

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:19.780
with Glass right now that is
beyond just productivity.

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:22.946
So I think it's been quite
successful from our opinion.

00:07:22.946 --> 00:07:23.960
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That's
awesome.

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:25.610
SONG ZHENG: I've been getting
updates constantly.

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:27.100
Hey, this person is
close to you.

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:28.310
Do you want to meet them?

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:31.390
And so I've been asking random
people, hey, are you Antonio,

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:33.320
are you Dave?

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:35.660
And eventually I found
my target.

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:39.700
And then it happened to also
be Jon's target, so we

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:41.820
introduced him to Antonio.

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:44.170
And we have never met each other
before, but we became

00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:45.820
friends right away.

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:48.900
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So we just have
a couple minutes left.

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:51.240
Let me ask you one
short question.

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:52.490
Give me a quick answer.

00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:55.460
What do you think's next
for "Icebreaker"?

00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:57.710
Do you think this is something
that you might keep going

00:07:57.710 --> 00:08:00.540
with, and people will keep
using to meet each other?

00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:02.120
RAJIV MAKHIJANI: I think we want
to just explore where it

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:05.730
goes, like see what people's
feedback is based on using it.

00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:07.365
See how many people actually
have Glass and

00:08:07.365 --> 00:08:08.560
are in the same proximity.

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:10.880
And then we can consider either
expanding it to other

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:13.790
devices, or if there's enough
Glass devices, then maybe

00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:15.550
figuring out ways to
recommend people

00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:16.450
that have common interests.

00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:20.150
If everyone has Glass, or not
necessarily everyone, but like

00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:22.305
a large percentage of people,
then it would be really cool

00:08:22.305 --> 00:08:25.090
to actually introduce you to
people that have other shared

00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:27.230
interests, not just that
they have Glass.

00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:29.960
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Very cool.

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:32.470
JONATHAN GOTTFRIED: I really
think that as the developer

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:35.760
tools expand for Glass, and as
we can start building more

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:38.380
advanced features, that we're
going to expand "Icebreaker"

00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:39.200
to match that.

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:42.130
We really want to be on the
cutting edge of Glass

00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:43.440
development.

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:47.420
And we want our application to
kind of embody the best and

00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:49.990
the most interesting
uses of Glass.

00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:52.590
And so I think that as we have
access to more features and

00:08:52.590 --> 00:08:54.290
more functionality, we're
going to integrate

00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:55.920
that into our app.

00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:58.780
SONG ZHENG: I think that as
Glass becomes more mainstream,

00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:02.220
and we start getting more
people using it, we're

00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:05.940
eventually going to maybe add
like interest fields, and

00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:08.210
match people of same
interests together.

00:09:08.210 --> 00:09:08.760
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That's cool.

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:11.620
SONG ZHENG: And then once we're
at that point, it would

00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:15.060
make sense to build an Android
app that goes along with it.

00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:19.880
So it welcomes other
players as well.

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:20.120
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Awesome.

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:23.330
Well, thank you guys so much for
joining me here, and for

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:25.910
building on Glass.

00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:27.830
And thank you out there
for joining us.

00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:30.150
