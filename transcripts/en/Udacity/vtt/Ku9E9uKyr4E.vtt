00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Suppose you observed a number of different fires and you graph

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
the number of firefighters versus the size of the fire.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
And for the sake of the argument, let's assume we studied four fires

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
with 10, 40, 200, and 70 firefighters involved

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and the sizes of the fires were given as follows: 100, 400, 2000, and 700

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
in terms of the surface area that the fire occupied.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Putting this into a diagram, you get pretty much the following.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Put the number of fighters. In fact, you've already learned this looks very linear.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
So, let me ask a question--is the number of the firefighters correlated with the size of the fire?

00:00:37.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Yes or no? Check one of the two boxes.
