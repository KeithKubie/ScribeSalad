00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.790
we’ve all chased lightning bugs as kids,
but what’s going on behind those glowing

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:05.850
behinds?

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.030
Hey Everyone Julia here for DNews

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:15.200
I grew up in the midwest and spent my childhood
summers chasing around lightening bugs.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.250
There’s something about them that just captures
the imagination.

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:21.850
But such powers of light don’t belong to
just those bugs.

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:25.340
Bioluminescence is found in a lot of different
animals! imagine waves of a bright lights

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:27.019
trailing behind your ships.

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:29.570
Such a phenomenon was part of sailors stories
for centuries.

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.800
It’s even described in Jules Verne “20,000
Leagues Under the Sea” as a “milky sea”.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.300
But it’s not just a story or a mystery,
really it’s all just chemistry.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.020
Most of the time it’s just two chemicals
in particular: luciferin and luciferase.

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.250
Luciferase, is an enzyme which binds oxygen
and luciferin together.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.870
This reaction creates a lot of energy, and
rather than being released as heat, it gives

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:50.870
off light.

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.010
The color depends on the way the luciferin
molecules are arranged.

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.030
While some organisms produce luciferin, others
have to eat the things that produce the chemical.

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.000
Or in the case of the angler fish, they house
the bacteria that makes the chemical.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.980
When you think of glowing creatures you might
think of only lightning bugs or deep sea creatures.

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:08.300
But bioluminescence is surprisingly common.

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.570
It happens anytime time of day or depth of
the ocean.

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:12.900
So why do they do it?

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.510
Well it’s not for generating heat.

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:16.640
Bioluminescence is a "cold light."

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.050
Cold light means less than 20% of the light
generates thermal radiation, or heat.

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:25.190
Some creatures like the anglerfish use this
trick as bait to lure in prey, other species

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.410
use it as a warning, the glow worm signals
“I’m poisonous!”, or some species of

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:33.120
fish release a flash of bioluminescent goo
to confuse their attackers.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.790
The hatchet fish uses it for camouflage.

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.790
Their undersides are lined with photophores,
organs filled with those glowing chemicals.

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.370
This tricks any predators that might attack
from below.

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:46.500
Normally a fish's silhouette against the sky
gives it away, but these photophores make

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.830
the hatchet fish blend in.

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:49.190
Pretty cool right?

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.530
And a lot of other animals use bioluminescence
for communication, Some scientists even think

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.470
it could be the most common form of communication
on the planet!

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:01.010
You might be familiar with this kind of light
display from lightning bugs signaling to find

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:02.010
a mate.

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:04.060
Some organisms shine when startled or scared.

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:10.030
The Milky Seas in 20,000 leagues was really
a bloom of algae, like the dinoflagellate,

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:11.030
Noctiluca Scintillans.

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.590
When these tiny guys get disturbed by a boat
or cresting wave, it triggers the chemical

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:15.590
reaction.

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:16.590
And they light up the sea.

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.819
Such dinoflagellates are currently putting
on quite a show off the coast of Tasmania.

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:23.700
But this is different from fluorescence.

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.670
Fluorescence is when an animal has proteins
that reflect light.

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.140
Kind of like how certain things glow under
a blacklight, some animals only glow under

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:31.260
certain wavelengths.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.110
Like the elegant jelly which reflects blue
light.

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.660
Scientists genetically modified some animals
like rabbits and cats with these fluorescent

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.130
proteins from jellyfish.

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.140
Yes glowing cats exist.

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.840
In fact the development of this technique
won a Nobel Prize in 2008.

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.140
By creating glowing cats or sheep, researchers
can track the formation of certain biological

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.350
processes like nerves growing or diseases
spreading.

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:56.471
Other researchers in San Francisco are creating
glowing plants and trees that could light

00:02:56.471 --> 00:02:58.569
up the night without using power.

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:02.020

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:11.470
What’s your favorite light up animal?

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.540
I’m kind of obsessed with hankler..

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:24.279
I mean angler fish.. let us know down the
