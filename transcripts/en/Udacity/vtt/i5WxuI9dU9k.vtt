I'm here at the Autodesk Gallery with David Larsson.

00:00:03.032 --> 00:00:07.233
David was the lead developer on a product called Beast for game developers.

00:00:07.233 --> 00:00:11.548
Many of the lighting demos you'll see in this unit were developed by David.

00:00:11.548 --> 00:00:14.565
So, David, as a start, what's your background?

00:00:14.565 --> 00:00:21.027
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I got a Commodore 128 as a Christmas gift. My brother and I got it together.

00:00:21.027 --> 00:00:25.871
And we started programming and exploring this basic environment, which is,

00:00:25.871 --> 00:00:29.339
which is basically the operating system, but also a programming language, which

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:35.112
you end up in, when you boot up one of those computers. And, I was kind of

00:00:35.112 --> 00:00:39.532
reading over the shoulder, and asked my brother to, you know, type in listings

00:00:39.532 --> 00:00:44.020
from computer magazines and instruction manuals and we, you know, started

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:50.856
making programs. And that's kind of how we got started, programming together.

00:00:50.856 --> 00:00:56.050
And when I was growing older, I got involved in something called the demo

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:00.210
scene, which is basically, just teenagers trying to outdo each other with

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.804
graphic effects and visual effects on, computers. And that was a really good

00:01:05.804 --> 00:01:10.906
boot camp for, for learning about graphics programming and and programming in

00:01:10.906 --> 00:01:16.582
general and also like, you know, running projects. It was a really effective

00:01:16.582 --> 00:01:20.630
way of, of learning all those tools that you need in order to, to become a, a

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:27.350
good programmer. So a few years, I had a time, when I was in college I also

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:34.374
temporarily worked for a game studio. And then, some time, when I was in my

00:01:34.374 --> 00:01:38.394
last year of college, a friend, actually another guy I knew from the demo

00:01:38.394 --> 00:01:42.682
scene, he asked me, if you, I wanted to come work for, the company they had,

00:01:42.682 --> 00:01:50.516
and that company is, was, Illuminate Labs. which is a, at that time we were

00:01:50.516 --> 00:01:57.122
developing a renderer that was kind of a general purpose rendering, renderer.

00:01:57.122 --> 00:02:01.532
And at some point we realized we have to narrow, like focus group, and what we

00:02:01.532 --> 00:02:04.870
did was target it towards game developers, and you know, things got much

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:11.745
bigger, and eventually we ended up being acquired by Autodesk. That's where

00:02:11.745 --> 00:02:14.459
I've been working for the last two and a half years.
