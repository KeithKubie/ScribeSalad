00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:10.250
To make all my decisions conscious, I started
filling the pictures with attention.

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:17.860
Just the way when an actor who's trained to
move in a completely natural way fills the

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:24.009
theater with the presence of attention.

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:25.920
I'm Stephen Shore.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.130
I'm a photographer, and this is an exhibition
of my work at the Museum of Modern Art.

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.980
It covers about 50 years of my work and career.

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.010
This is a room of black and white work I did
when I was a teenager.

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:47.970
When I was 17, I met Andy Warhol, and asked
if I could come to his studio to photograph.

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:52.510
And as soon as I went there, I realized that
that was more interesting than going to high

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:53.510
school.

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.310
So this is what I did instead of going to
college, I spent three years on and off photographing

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:59.490
at the Factory.

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:05.650
This picture was made probably within the
first week or two of my going to the factory.

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:12.439
And it's a picture of me and Andy, and I guess
it could go down in history as my first selfie.

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:13.439
Yes.

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.130
This is a film called "Elevator."

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.920
I made it when I was, I guess, about 16.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.590
And it was shown at a theater in New York
called the Filmmakers' Cinematheque the same

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.689
night that Andy premiered one of his movies,
"The Life of Juanita Castro."

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:34.799
And that's how I was introduced to Andy.

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:40.850
In the early '70s, in 1970 and '71, I became
very interested in the vernacular uses of

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:41.850
photography.

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.689
I began using color.

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:49.740
Because all snapshots were in color, all postcards
were in color, television was, movies were.

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.509
But art photography was this one holdout.

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:55.909
Art photography was always in black and white.

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:01.869
And it was a convention that I didn't understand,
and I think there's something in me that just

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:07.060
likes to question visual conventions.

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.410
Which brings us to this room.

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:16.360
This is a recreation of a show that I put
on in New York called "American Surfaces."

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.659
It was a gallery named LIGHT Gallery.

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:22.510
And it was hung just as these are.

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:31.140
And one thing I wanted to do was to take pictures
that felt like they were not burdened with

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.660
visual conventions.

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:37.319
I want to take pictures that felt like seeing.

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:42.730
Just the way when people write they use a
different language than they use when they

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.000
speak.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.430
The language may be a little more stilted.

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.530
It may be a little more formal.

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.380
And I wanted to get to that quality of speaking.

00:02:54.380 --> 00:03:02.130
So what I would do as an exercise is in various
moments during the day, at random moments,

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.010
I would become aware of my field of vision.

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:11.530
To put it in modern terms, it would be like
taking a screenshot of my field of vision.

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:18.010
And I did this so I could see what it was
like to see what the experience I was seeing

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:19.480
looked like.

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.569
And I used that as a guide in how I made my
pictures.

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:29.459
So I chose this one as an example of what
I was saying because it doesn't stand out

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:31.620
as a highly charged event.

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.109
It's something you might see during the day.

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:40.470
And I think it's also an example of seeing
it the way an eye would see it.

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.680
That the lines are not aligned.

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.120
That the water fountain is placed in the center.

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:52.420
There was a visual convention at the time
that you don't put the subject of the picture

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:59.579
in the center, which runs completely counter
to how we see, because you always are looking

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:06.000
at your subject.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.599
After I finished the series "American Surfaces,"
I started using a view camera.

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:13.989
These are big cameras on a tripod.

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:20.860
Just like the cameras that were used in the
19th century, where the camera's on a tripod

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:24.140
and you go under a dark cloth to focus.

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:28.910
One thing that I noticed right away using
the view camera, because the images are so

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:34.970
highly detailed, there are little things in
the picture that I can see that I don't have

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:38.480
to make the subject of the picture.

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:43.220
So for example, if you look closely in this
scene, there's a window.

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:49.640
And in the window is a boy, and his breath
is on the glass.

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:55.440
Where "American Surfaces" were about the act
of seeing almost as though one's seeing through

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.340
my eyes.

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:08.040
In "Uncommon Places," I'm often relying on
the descriptive power of the camera to make

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:13.160
a complex picture that the viewer moves their
attention through.

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:20.880
So what I'm doing is creating a small world
for a viewer to explore, rather than the impression

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.320
of what it's like to look through my eyes.

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:32.470
One thing I've always been interested in is
what the world looks like when it's seen when

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:35.310
you're in a state of heightened awareness.

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:43.000
Those moments which I think everyone has where
experience feels more tangible.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.900
Where experience feels more vivid.

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:53.870
And as you walk down the street with that
frame of mind, relationships begin to stand

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:54.870
out.

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:57.800
Let's go to this picture.

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:04.280
This is a picture I made in 1975 at the intersection
of Beverly and La Brea in Los Angeles.

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:16.000
And I think it represents the height of structural
density in my work, where I'm looking at every

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.470
visual relationship in the picture.

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:27.250
I'm looking at the relationship of this to
this, of this to this, of this to this, of

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:29.440
this to this all throughout the picture.

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:34.000
And so, this is structurally about as dense
as any picture I made.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:40.660
In the process of becoming aware of all the
structural elements of a picture, to make

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:46.440
all my decisions conscious, I started filling
the pictures with attention.

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:56.460
And so, although this seems as casual and
as natural as an "American Surfaces" picture,

00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:04.440
the difference is for me, there's a resonance
of conscious attention that fills the picture.

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:11.710
Just the way when an actor who's trained to
move in a completely natural way, who can

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:22.670
walk across a stage without apparent self-consciousness,
fills the theater with the presence of attention.

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:25.920
What would be called "stage presence."

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:29.580
And this would be the visual equivalent of
stage presence.

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:34.280
In 1980, my wife and I moved to Montana.

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:41.500
And when I started living there and thinking
about what to photograph, I realized that

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:50.650
if I photographed the land, I would be seeing
it through the eyes of a New Yorker, and taking

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:53.440
pictures that essentially said, "Wow.

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:55.460
Isn't this beautiful?"

00:07:55.460 --> 00:08:00.150
And that those pictures would have missed
something that I would be doing if I were

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:03.610
photographing in the city or a small town.

00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:08.150
And that is, they wouldn't be expressing a
perception of the place.

00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:12.290
It wouldn't be expressing a subtle perception
of the place.

00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:21.110
And so, I took this as my next objective to
understand landscape photography.

00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:29.280
And so, I lived there for two years, seeing
land in different light, becoming familiar

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:30.280
with it.

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:34.930
Developing those perceptions, hiking on it,
until a point about two years later where

00:08:34.930 --> 00:08:44.340
I felt that I had the perceptions I needed
to begin to make what, to me, would be interesting

00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:45.340
photographs.

00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:51.970
One lingering question I had after my formal
explorations of the '70s was could I go to

00:08:51.970 --> 00:09:02.030
a flat, open piece of land that didn't have
streets that defined one point perspective?

00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:11.240
That didn't have telephone poles to emphasize
the frame?

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:17.980
That it was just an open piece of land and
treeless piece of land, and figure out how

00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:22.650
to make it look like deep space receding?

00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:29.520
As you move your attention from the foreground
all the way back without skipping over anything,

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:35.840
back to the horizon, you may have a sensation
of your eye changing focus.

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:40.940
But this is an illusion because you're looking
at a flat image.

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:45.680
After living for a few years in Montana, I
moved to the Hudson Valley in New York State

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:52.330
and began teaching at Bard College, which
I understand is ironic since as I told you

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:54.490
earlier, I had dropped out of high school.

00:09:54.490 --> 00:09:59.320
Bard is a liberal arts institution, not a
fine arts school.

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:07.130
And I knew that most of the students I was
teaching wouldn't continue as photographers.

00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:12.560
And so, I thought about "What is it that I
can teach through photography that would benefit

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:13.900
anyone?"

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:21.570
And that is, again, referring to a theme that
I introduced a while back, the experience

00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:27.480
of seeing with conscious attention, and that
photography is a tool from learning how to

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:34.370
do that, and that this is something that would
benefit anyone.

00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:42.120
That seeing with conscious attention and seeing
with self-awareness, in a way, feeds people,

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:43.060
feeds part of the mind.
