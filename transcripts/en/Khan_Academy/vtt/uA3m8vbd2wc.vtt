00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:04.430
This is another problem that
Kortaggio sent me, and I like

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:07.750
these problems a lot because
they seem fairly simple on the

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:10.010
surface, and actually the
solutions are pretty simple.

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:13.300
But just the nature of the lack
of information they give, it

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.760
becomes kind of hard to even
get started with

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:16.310
these problems.

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:18.820
And I'll be frank, this
problem, I kind of stumbled

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.440
around with it for a couple of
minutes until I finally

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:25.210
realized what they were asking
for or how to solve for it.

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.920
So in this problem, we
have Bev, and she takes a

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.000
train home at 4 o'clock.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.760
She arrives at the
station at 6 o'clock.

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.800
Every day, driving at the
same rate, her husband

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.630
meets her at the station.

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:39.450
Fair enough.

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.840
One day, she takes the train an
hour early and arrives at 5:00.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.165
Her husband leaves home to meet
her at the same usual time.

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.860
Husband leaves home to meet
her at the usual time.

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:56.180
So maybe an interesting thing
is to think about when does

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.810
the husband normally leave?

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:01.300
So let's say that this
is a normal scenario.

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.700
I'll do that in green.

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.000
At 6 o'clock, she arrives.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.530
We got there.

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.130
She arrives at the
station at 6 o'clock.

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.730
I don't know if this 4
o'clock is useful yet.

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:14.530
And the husband, he gets there
right when she gets there.

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.220
So he traveled-- he gets there,
and I don't know if I'm-- maybe

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.380
I should draw a more-- well,
let me just draw it this way.

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.150
I think this is how my
brain kind of handles it.

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.960
So he gets there.

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.760
And when did he have to leave?

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:33.610
What was his time?

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.960
So let's say it takes him
t minutes to get there,

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.750
whatever t is given in.

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.150
So if he gets there at 6
o'clock, that means he left

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.260
at 6 o'clock minus t.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.400
If t is 30 minutes,
it would be 5:30.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.000
If t is one hour, it
would be 5 o'clock.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:58.600
So leaves at 6 o'clock minus t.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.970
And t, whatever units
t happens to be.

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:02.450
Then he picks her up,
and what does he do?

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.150
He goes back home, right?

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:06.910
He goes back home.

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.250
Let me do that with a-- I'll
do that with a skinnier line.

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.850
He goes back home, same
distance, and we assume that

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:16.890
the car just turns around
immediately, and that there's

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.530
no time devoted to
picking her up.

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.960
She just kind of jumps on
the car as he spins around.

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.520
So it should take him the same
amount of time, right, t.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:25.890
So when does he
arrive back at home?

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.940
So if it took him-- he left t
minutes before 6 o'clock and

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.020
got there, so when
does he get back?

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.720
Well, it's going to take him t
minutes to get back, so he's

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:39.020
going to arrive at
6 o'clock plus t.

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:40.670
And so what was the
total amount of time

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:41.280
that he traveled?

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.650
And this is almost
superficially easy.

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.420
Well, if you-- 6 o'clock plus t
minus 6 o'clock minus t, the

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.180
difference in time is just 2t.

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.830
He traveled a distance of-- or
a total time of 2t minutes,

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.120
and that's almost obvious.

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.310
If it takes him t minutes to go
and t minutes to come back,

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.130
he traveled t minutes.

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:59.240
Fair enough.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.370
Now, what happened on this day?

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.420
It says that he leaves-- her
husband leaves home to meet

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:05.790
her at the usual time.

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.810
So once again, he is going
to leave-- he leaves--

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.520
I'll do this in red.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:22.780
He leaves at 6 o'clock
minus t, right?

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.060
And then, she arrived early,
so she's going to be walking

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.510
back, so there's going to be
some smaller time that it

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.250
takes him to reach her.

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.530
So let's just leave that
unlabeled right now.

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.840
So if I have a line here-- so
he's going to travel a shorter

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.350
distance, and, of course, it's
going to take him less time

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:41.150
because she started walking.

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.440
That's what the problem
tells us, right?

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.420
Today she arrives at 5 o'clock,
and she begins to walk home.

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:49.610
So she's going to make some
distance up so he's not going

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:51.650
to have to travel quite as far.

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:54.810
And then whatever time
that was, he goes

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.710
back the other way.

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:01.360
It's going to be the
same amount of time.

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.670
It's the same amount of time.

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:06.130
And what does it tell us?

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:08.330
He meets her on the way,
and then they arrive

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:09.870
home 20 minutes early.

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.910
So normally, they arrive at
6 o'clock plus t, right?

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:14.820
That's normal.

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.800
So today, they're going to
arrive 20 minutes early.

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:23.930
So they're going to arrive
at, you could say, 6 o'clock

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:27.830
plus t-- that's just that--
minus 20 minutes, right?

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:29.690
They're going to arrive
20 minutes early.

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:31.660
So what's the total amount
of time that he would have

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.220
traveled on that day?

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.110
The total amount of time?

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:39.480
Well, he essentially travels
20 minutes less than he does

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:40.480
on a normal day, right?

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.630
He leaves at the same time and
he gets there 20 minutes early.

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:46.080
And if you take the difference
between 6 plus t minus 20 and 6

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:50.490
minus t, you're going
to get 2t minus 20.

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.730
And that's almost-- I
probably didn't even have

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:53.750
to draw all of this.

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:55.545
You could just say, well, you
know, on a regular day, it

00:04:55.545 --> 00:04:57.990
takes them two-- if t is the
amount of time it normally

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.380
takes him to go to the
station, on a normal day,

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:03.080
he travels 2t minutes.

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.140
Today, he leaves at the same
time, gets 20 minutes early, so

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:09.870
he travels 2t minus 20 minutes.

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:10.950
Fair enough.

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:12.110
Now, what does that tell us?

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:14.630
Well, how long did it
take him to get to her?

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:17.200
How long did this take her?

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.410
Well, to go to pick her up
takes the same amount of time

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:23.620
as to come back, so he must
have taken half of this time

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:25.940
to go and half of this
time to come back.

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:29.650
So it must have been t
minus 10 to go, and then

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:32.340
t minus 10 to come back.

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:35.800
So it took him 10 minutes
less to reach her this time.

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.630
So what time does
he pick her up?

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:39.570
And this is the key.

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:43.090
So normally, when it takes
him t minutes, he gets

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:44.820
there at 6 o'clock.

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:48.040
This time she started walking
because she got there early,

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:51.080
and he gets there 10 minutes--
he reaches her 10 minutes

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.190
earlier than he normally
would have reached her,

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:54.910
right? t minus 10.

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:57.020
Normally, he reaches
her at 6 o'clock.

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:59.340
Today he reaches her
10 minutes earlier.

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:05.740
So he reaches her at 5:50.

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:10.750
Now, the question is, how
many minutes did Bev walk?

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:13.500
How many minutes did Bev walk?

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:17.340
Remember, she arrived an hour
early and arrives at 5 o'clock,

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:19.550
and then she starts walking.

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:24.250
She arrives at 5:00, 5 o'clock,
and just starts walking.

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:25.330
And when does he pick her up?

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:26.950
He picks her up at 5:50.

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:30.540
So she walked for 50 minutes.

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:31.900
That's a neat problem.

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:35.010
Because on some level, it's
very easy, but on a lot of

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:38.000
other levels, they give you
all of this other information

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.110
that's not necessary.

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:40.870
For example, you don't
have to know that she

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:42.480
leaves at 4 o'clock.

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:45.040
That's actually probably the
most unnecessary piece of

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:47.480
information, but everything
else is kind of left abstract.

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:49.750
But even though you can--
they're not giving a lot of

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:52.780
details, you can actually
figure out how far she walked

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:56.100
without knowing how fast she
walks, or how fast her husband

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:58.640
drives, or how far they are
from the train station, or how

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:00.670
far the house is from the train
station, or any of that.

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:02.970
You're still able to figure
out how far she walked.

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:04.620
Anyway, neat problem.

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:05.680
Thanks again to Kortaggio.
