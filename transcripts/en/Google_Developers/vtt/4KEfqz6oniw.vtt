ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE:
Hi, everyone.

00:00:01.666 --> 00:00:03.600
We're here at Devoxx
2014, and I'm here

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.360
with Cyril Mottier,
who's a Google Developer

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.491
expert in Android.

00:00:08.491 --> 00:00:09.990
And we're going to
talk specifically

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.490
today about Android Wear,
because he is actually

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:15.590
giving a talk about Android
Wear at this conference.

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:16.091
Welcome.

00:00:16.091 --> 00:00:17.048
CYRIL MOTTIER: Welcome.

00:00:17.048 --> 00:00:17.650
Thank you.

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.580
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE:
So Android,

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:23.950
from the very beginning, has
had different form factors

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:27.750
and has, from day one, assumed
that people would produce

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.950
phones and eventually tablets
of different forms and shapes,

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:35.130
and developers had
to deal with that.

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.340
Now we have Android
Wear, which obviously

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:42.290
is a whole lot less real estate,
but it's probably not just

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:43.480
a smaller form factor.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.010
Tell us about how
it changes things

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:46.380
from a developer perspective.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:47.963
CYRIL MOTTIER: Well,
yes, as you said,

00:00:47.963 --> 00:00:50.060
Android Wear is not
just a tiny Android.

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:54.540
Actually, it's a tweaked Android
that is made for wearables.

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:59.000
And by tweaked, I mean that they
completely reinvented the way

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.260
that you interact
with the device.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.240
This is done mostly by creating
a new UI, a new user interface,

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.150
where the paradigm is completely
different, because you

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.680
don't have a grid
of apps anymore.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.480
You have a principle
of cards, and each card

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.350
is actually an information
from one application

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.845
that you can swipe or
have more info about.

00:01:20.845 --> 00:01:22.220
ALEXIS MOUSSINE
POUCHKINE: Right.

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.350
So I think that's really
key to understand,

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.270
that people shouldn't
be just trying

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:27.521
to shrink down an application.

00:01:27.521 --> 00:01:28.478
CYRIL MOTTIER: Exactly.

00:01:28.478 --> 00:01:30.420
So you have to think
completely differently.

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.560
And this is done,
basically, by starting

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.630
a completely new design process.

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.810
So drop everything that
you've done for the phones

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.390
and tablets, and start thinking
about something completely new

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.430
for a small form factor.

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.444
And you also said about
shapes and stuff like that.

00:01:48.444 --> 00:01:49.860
Actually, there
is something which

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.400
is quite funny,
because we've always

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.180
been prepared, as
Android developers,

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.150
about different form
factors, but they were always

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:03.070
square or actually
a rectangle screen.

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.790
And now we have round screens,
which is completely new to us,

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.280
but the good thing is it's
nice to see that Android adapts

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.405
itself quite correctly
to that kind of screen.

00:02:12.405 --> 00:02:13.780
ALEXIS
MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE: Great.

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.880
So actually, I think what's
important is to find a good use

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:18.960
case for the wearable.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.540
We're not about trying to
take any and every application

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.220
and take it running there.

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.577
So the first obvious
use case for which

00:02:26.577 --> 00:02:28.160
I understand you
don't have much to do

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.650
is notifications in general.

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.090
So a wearable, or
Android Wear, is

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:39.100
paired with a phone or a
tablet, so any notification

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.489
you get on that device
will also be mirrored,

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:45.780
and the developer doesn't
need to do anything for that.

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.100
Is that correct?

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.933
CYRIL MOTTIER: Yeah.

00:02:47.933 --> 00:02:50.840
We're working out of a box.

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.750
Well, it's a spoiler
about my conference

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.830
that I will do tomorrow,
but basically, there

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.880
are three main principles
on Android Wear, which

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.810
is that your application
needs to be glance-able,

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.760
it needs to be
contextual, and it

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.640
needs to require low
interaction or no interaction.

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.890
And when you think
about those principles,

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.220
actually, the only thing
on the current Android,

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.600
on phones and tablets,
that fits today's principle

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:18.710
are notifications.

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:22.330
So out of the box,
Android Wear is

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.730
displaying all of the
notifications that are actually

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.800
displayed on the
phones and tablets.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.250
And those notifications
are synced.

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.520
So when you swipe away some
notification on the wearable,

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:35.902
they are also swiped from
the phones, and vice versa.

00:03:35.902 --> 00:03:38.110
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE:
That's probably very good.

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.290
In terms of using the
Notification API from Android,

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.240
is there anything
special you need to do,

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.139
so it looks good on
the wearable as well?

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:46.930
CYRIL MOTTIER: Well,
as I said, by default,

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.990
it works, but it's
not quite fancy.

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:52.200
So you can tweak
the notification

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.890
by using some wearable
extender classes, which

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:00.630
are provided as part
of the support library.

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:04.280
By doing that, you can have
access to some new notification

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.060
features that are only
available to wearables, such

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:08.460
as you can change
the background,

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:11.120
you can have some
principle of tags or pages

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.620
that are quite nice
if you want to--

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:13.920
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE:
Group things together.

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.386
CYRIL MOTTIER: --split the
information in several cards.

00:04:16.386 --> 00:04:17.300
Yeah.

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:18.920
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE: So
eventually, you get to a point

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:19.961
where this is not enough.

00:04:19.961 --> 00:04:21.310
You want to get to custom UIs.

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:24.010
You want to build an app that
actually runs on the Android

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:25.689
system you have on your wrist.

00:04:25.689 --> 00:04:26.480
CYRIL MOTTIER: Yes.

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:27.896
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE:
So that

00:04:27.896 --> 00:04:30.070
involves building a full
new app, which eventually

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:34.610
is an APK, which needs to
make its way to the wearable.

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:39.240
So take us through how hard it
is, what it takes to actually--

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.220
what kind of APIs do
you have available?

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:42.420
What can you do?

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:45.321
And maybe the workflow.

00:04:45.321 --> 00:04:47.320
CYRIL MOTTIER: When you
start with notification,

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:51.450
you have to go through
the custom APK path.

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:55.270
What most people don't know
about that is that actually,

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:58.380
Android Wear is just Android.

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:00.690
At the time we're
talking, it's KitKat.

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:05.210
So what you're doing
for tablets is radically

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:08.100
the same as what you
can do on wearables.

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:10.980
So you have access to the
exact same set of APIs,

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:13.890
except some packages like USB.

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:16.010
You don't have access
to USB, WebKit,

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:18.770
because it makes no
sense on a wearable.

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:23.445
But when you're creating an
application on Android Wear,

00:05:23.445 --> 00:05:24.820
from the technical
point of view,

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:26.440
it's exactly the
same as what you

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:28.780
can do on phones and tablets.

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:31.090
What you really
have to keep in mind

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:33.670
is that it's different from
the UX and UI point of view.

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:35.780
This is the only difference
between Android Wear

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:37.160
and Android [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:38.670
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE:
OK, I have another difference.

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:40.212
The wearable is not
really connected.

00:05:40.212 --> 00:05:42.461
Or it's connected to the
phones, so there's the data--

00:05:42.461 --> 00:05:44.820
CYRIL MOTTIER: Not yet, but
maybe it will in the future.

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:46.670
And that's a good
point of using Android

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:49.090
in Android Wear, because
actually, Android

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:50.880
is future-proof.

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.550
I don't know when the
technology will evolve

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:57.430
and when wearables will
have access to the network.

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:59.130
Then it will already be ready.

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:01.765
We will have almost nothing to
do, because it's just Android.

00:06:01.765 --> 00:06:03.140
ALEXIS MOUSSINE
POUCHKINE: Right.

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:05.820
So roll back to today, to
what we have and developers

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:07.830
have today.

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:12.770
They need to use the data
layer APIs to exchange data

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:15.700
and access the
internet, for example.

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:17.770
So how does that work?

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:20.600
The watch cannot make a call
to the internet directly.

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:23.190
It goes through the phone
for anything it has to do.

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:24.023
CYRIL MOTTIER: Yeah.

00:06:24.023 --> 00:06:28.260
So nowadays, what we
have is a wearable

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.460
that is connected to the phone.

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:34.750
Both phones and
wearables are considered

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:36.600
as nodes in a network.

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:39.970
And because the phone has more
capabilities than the wearable,

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:43.290
it acts like a sever
to the wearable.

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:44.830
So whenever you
want to have access

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:46.270
to some data on
the internet, you

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:51.070
have to make the wearable
connect to the phone

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:53.670
to send and ask for
information to the phone.

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:56.270
And then the phone will ask to
the network, so for instance,

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:58.770
server on your back end.

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:04.340
All of that is done thanks to
an API that is called Data API.

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:06.460
But actually, there
is two other APIs.

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:08.560
But most of the time,
you are using Data APIs,

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:12.810
because it's an API that syncs
some data between the phone

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:16.970
and the wearable automatically
thanks to Google Play Services.

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:18.679
This runs on top of
Google Play Services.

00:07:18.679 --> 00:07:20.844
ALEXIS MOUSSINE POUCHKINE:
That's a very good point.

00:07:20.844 --> 00:07:23.220
Google Play Services plays
this really critical role

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:25.994
and embeds most of the
magic that happens.

00:07:25.994 --> 00:07:27.910
CYRIL MOTTIER: It can
be updated automatically

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:31.560
without having to wait
for a system update, which

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:34.480
is quite nice, because if
there are some fixes to do,

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:36.050
Google can push
that automatically

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:39.224
without asking carriers.

00:07:39.224 --> 00:07:40.640
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE:
So that

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:43.060
was a quick, abstract
view of everything,

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:46.300
but you have been doing
some really concrete work

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:48.259
on an application,
actually, shipping it,

00:07:48.259 --> 00:07:49.300
and having people use it.

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:52.080
Tell us about that experience.

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:55.875
What is it, and what does it do,
and maybe some lessons learned.

00:07:55.875 --> 00:07:58.250
CYRIL MOTTIER: I've been
working on an application called

00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:00.740
Capitaine Train, which
is a company that

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:01.820
sells train tickets.

00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:04.930
But what we want to do is
not just sell train tickets.

00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:07.180
What we want to do is
to revolutionize the way

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:08.590
that people
experience the train.

00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:11.150
And that means that we
also want to improve

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:14.350
the overall experience
in the train.

00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:16.500
One of the things that
we have to do in France

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:21.520
is to make the train agent,
train controller check

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:24.452
a barcode, because this barcode
contains your actual ticket.

00:08:24.452 --> 00:08:26.410
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE:
Your e-ticket, yeah.

00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:28.380
CYRIL MOTTIER: So
because of that,

00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:30.280
we already had a
phone application

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:32.539
that was displaying the barcode.

00:08:32.539 --> 00:08:33.340
It was nice.

00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:35.500
But when Android
was released, I was

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:38.010
like, we need to do
that on the wearable,

00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:42.059
because it's even more
usable and easy to do.

00:08:42.059 --> 00:08:44.959
You don't have to get your phone
out of your pocket or the bag.

00:08:44.959 --> 00:08:46.500
ALEXIS MOUSSINE
POUCHKINE: Unlock it.

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:47.720
CYRIL MOTTIER: You just
have to look at your wrist,

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:50.350
and present your wrist to the
train agent, and that's it.

00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:50.534
ALEXIS MOUSSINE POUCHKINE: Yeah.

00:08:50.534 --> 00:08:53.136
You get the notification, you
know, where you're sitting.

00:08:53.136 --> 00:08:54.760
And then when the
controller shows up--

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:56.593
CYRIL MOTTIER: There
is actually two parts--

00:08:56.593 --> 00:08:59.370
the part prior to the trip and
then the part during the trip.

00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:00.440
So yeah, you're right.

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:03.140
There is also the
part prior to the trip

00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:06.580
where you can have access
to all of the information,

00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:09.010
such as your carriage,
your seat, and stuff

00:09:09.010 --> 00:09:11.990
like that, what time
the train is leaving.

00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:14.210
And then you have
the barcode that you

00:09:14.210 --> 00:09:15.970
can present during the trip.

00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:18.650
So at the beginning when
I wanted to do that,

00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:22.330
I wanted to stay to the
line and use notifications.

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:25.050
But actually, we
have one big problem

00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:28.930
with a barcode like that is that
we need to keep the screen on,

00:09:28.930 --> 00:09:30.860
because you don't
want the wearable

00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:33.670
to turn off while you're
presenting the barcode.

00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:35.180
And we also need to--

00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:35.430
ALEXIS MOUSSINE
POUCHKINE: And it

00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:36.480
needs to be full
brightness, too.

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:38.150
CYRIL MOTTIER: Yeah,
full brightness.

00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:45.650
Because of that, we have to go
through the system APK path.

00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:48.820
Developing for Android Wear was
quite nice, quite challenging,

00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:51.550
because as I said, it's very
similar to what we can do on--

00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:53.050
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE:
It's new.

00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:53.800
It has rough edges.

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:54.700
It's got to have them.

00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:55.741
CYRIL MOTTIER: Of course.

00:09:55.741 --> 00:09:57.430
It's Android.

00:09:57.430 --> 00:09:59.960
It's not that new,
but actually, what's

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:03.020
new was the communication
between the phone

00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:04.680
and the wearable.

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:07.039
And I spent quite
a lot of time--

00:10:07.039 --> 00:10:09.247
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE:
Understanding exactly what

00:10:09.247 --> 00:10:09.630
was going on.

00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:10.990
CYRIL MOTTIER: --understanding
exactly what it does.

00:10:10.990 --> 00:10:13.754
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE: Maybe
a little bit of magic going on.

00:10:13.754 --> 00:10:15.920
CYRIL MOTTIER: I think maybe
the problem is I always

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:18.430
try to deep-dive
into things and try

00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:20.270
to understand
exactly how it works.

00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:23.910
Maybe it's OK for people that
just want to do something

00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:25.890
and don't care
about how it works.

00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:29.040
So basically, this
application is automatically

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:33.624
displaying the notification
when it's important to the user.

00:10:33.624 --> 00:10:35.290
What we wanted to do
is something that--

00:10:35.290 --> 00:10:36.150
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE:
It's contextual, really.

00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:36.220
CYRIL MOTTIER: Yeah.

00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:36.886
It's contextual.

00:10:36.886 --> 00:10:39.920
We didn't want to have
an application kit

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:44.680
that you have to start when
you're in the railway station.

00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:46.370
So it's automatic.

00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:49.214
It works like magic, and
this is what Android Wear is.

00:10:49.214 --> 00:10:50.880
It's just displaying
just the right info

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:52.320
at just the right time.

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:53.695
ALEXIS MOUSSINE
POUCHKINE: Right.

00:10:53.695 --> 00:10:57.130
It seems to fit very well
with what wearables should be.

00:10:57.130 --> 00:10:58.070
And that has been out.

00:10:58.070 --> 00:10:59.090
People have been using it.

00:10:59.090 --> 00:10:59.710
CYRIL MOTTIER: Yes.

00:10:59.710 --> 00:11:01.750
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE:
Some good or bad feedback?

00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:02.791
People actually using it.

00:11:02.791 --> 00:11:05.330
That in itself is a
good feedback, I guess.

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:07.880
CYRIL MOTTIER:
Well, there is not

00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:09.590
a lot of people
having an Android Wear

00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:10.550
device on their wrist.

00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:11.820
ALEXIS MOUSSINE POUCHKINE:
It's still pretty new.

00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:14.600
CYRIL MOTTIER: But the people
having an Android Wear device

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:17.974
are amazed, because it's--

00:11:17.974 --> 00:11:20.140
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE:
It's this magical moment.

00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:20.640
CYRIL MOTTIER:
--quite geeky for now,

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:23.390
but it's magical, because it
just shows at the right moment,

00:11:23.390 --> 00:11:26.460
and you can present
that to the train agent.

00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:30.730
I think the most amazed people
were actually the train agents,

00:11:30.730 --> 00:11:33.320
because they were
like, what is that?

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:36.659
They were so proud to
scan my wrist like that.

00:11:36.659 --> 00:11:38.075
ALEXIS MOUSSINE
POUCHKINE: And I'm

00:11:38.075 --> 00:11:39.491
pretty sure you
had some fun, too,

00:11:39.491 --> 00:11:41.580
doing that when it
was not even released

00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:41.810
and they were the first ones.

00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:43.200
CYRIL MOTTIER: Yeah, especially
during the beta phase,

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:45.640
because I was the only one
having this application.

00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:48.170
And the controller-- well,
I have never seen that.

00:11:48.170 --> 00:11:50.670
ALEXIS MOUSSINE POUCHKINE: It
was pretty easy for them, too,

00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:51.240
right?

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:54.100
They too don't have to wait
for somebody to pull out.

00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:56.062
So it's quicker and
faster for them as well.

00:11:56.062 --> 00:11:57.020
CYRIL MOTTIER: Exactly.

00:11:57.020 --> 00:11:57.729
So it just works.

00:11:57.729 --> 00:12:00.353
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE: So I
guess we had a quick tour here.

00:12:00.353 --> 00:12:02.170
Maybe I have one
last, final question.

00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:04.260
What kind of watch do you wear?

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:05.760
CYRIL MOTTIER: So
I have the LG one.

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:07.010
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE: OK.

00:12:07.010 --> 00:12:09.840
Tell me more about why you have
this one more than another one.

00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:12.870
CYRIL MOTTIER: Well, I actually
have the Samsung one and also

00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:17.510
the Moto 360, but I decided
to switch back to the LG one

00:12:17.510 --> 00:12:21.140
after using the Moto
360 for three weeks,

00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:24.090
because I think the
Moto 360 is nice.

00:12:24.090 --> 00:12:25.200
It's good-looking.

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:28.010
It's better than a
square screen like that.

00:12:28.010 --> 00:12:29.680
But I think it's too big.

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:32.840
And the second problem I have
with that is that I'm a runner.

00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:36.310
And when I run with a leather
bracelet, I sweat a lot,

00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:40.100
and I don't like to have
the wet bracelet like that.

00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:42.174
And because this
one is in plastic,

00:12:42.174 --> 00:12:43.590
I don't have that
kind of problem.

00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:44.400
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE:
You can change straps.

00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:46.233
CYRIL MOTTIER: I can
change, but actually, I

00:12:46.233 --> 00:12:48.215
would like to change
between when I'm at work

00:12:48.215 --> 00:12:49.090
and when I'm running.

00:12:49.090 --> 00:12:50.965
I would like to have
two different bracelets.

00:12:50.965 --> 00:12:53.360
And this is not currently
possible with Android Wear.

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:54.950
I hope it will be in the future.

00:12:54.950 --> 00:12:55.650
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE:
Well, we already

00:12:55.650 --> 00:12:57.816
have different form factors,
different manufactures,

00:12:57.816 --> 00:13:01.200
different everything, which is
the idea of having one Android

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:03.640
Wear but different
implementations,

00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:04.390
different devices.

00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:05.348
CYRIL MOTTIER: Exactly.

00:13:05.348 --> 00:13:08.740
I've tested the application, for
instance, on the three devices,

00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:10.430
and it was working correctly.

00:13:10.430 --> 00:13:12.820
This is where Android excels.

00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:14.115
It works everywhere.

00:13:14.115 --> 00:13:15.490
ALEXIS
MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE: Great.

00:13:15.490 --> 00:13:18.050
So on that note, I think that's
all the time we have for you.

00:13:18.050 --> 00:13:19.870
Thank you, Cyril,
for taking the time.

00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:22.740
And go get some Wear apps.

00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:25.800
Develop them, use them,
give us some feedback.

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:27.350
Cheers.
