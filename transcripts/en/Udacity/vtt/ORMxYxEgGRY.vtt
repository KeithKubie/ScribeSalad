00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.660
Okay Michael, so here is a, another little game for us

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:05.790
to play. And, what I want you to notice about this

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.310
game before I describe it to you in detail is that

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:12.030
we have relaxed yet another one of the constraints. So, we

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.660
started out playing two player, zero sum, deterministic games of perfect

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.920
information. There's also a finite in there somewhere. From now on

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.980
we're just going to assume everything's finite, because why not? And then,

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.250
what we did last time. Just a few seconds ago. Is we

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.770
relax the deterministic part, so we have two player,

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:31.280
zero sum, non-deterministic games of perfect information, and now

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.840
we are going to relax the requirement for perfect information.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.540
So now we're going to look at two player, zero-sum,

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.920
possibly non-deterministic games of hidden information. And this is

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.520
really important Michael because, this last little bit of

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.740
relaxation, going from perfect information to hidden information is

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.340
going to be sort of a quantum leap into the

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.720
difficult problems of game theory. So this is where

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.060
it actually starts to get interesting so we have been

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:56.960
building a foundation so far and now we are

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.720
going to get to the interesting and complicated stuff, okay?

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.970
&gt;&gt; Wow, one of the things that I learned

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:05.030
just now is that the opposite of perfect is hidden.

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.500
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.740
&gt;&gt; I always thought the opposite of perfect is imperfect but okay but hidden.

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.910
I guess if I do not have a perfect face I should hide my face.

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:15.900
&gt;&gt; Thats in fact the atomology

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.270
of the phrase.

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:18.958
&gt;&gt; Alright, I understand now.

00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:21.240
&gt;&gt; Yeah, cool, It's in wikipedia. Here we go, let me describe

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.990
the game to you, are you ready? This is a version of

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.100
mini poker where there are a set of cards, but they have

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.250
no numbers of faces on them they are just red or black, okay.

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.570
&gt;&gt; And red is bad, for our hero, Player

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.590
A, and black is good for our hero, Player A.

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.740
&gt;&gt; Okay?

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:41.260
&gt;&gt; I see.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.693
&gt;&gt; So--

00:01:41.693 --> 00:01:42.660
&gt;&gt; Wait. Why's it have to be red?

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.860
&gt;&gt; I don't know, man. You know, red. You know how it is. Okay.

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.090
So, here are the rules. They're all written down on the screen, but let me

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.730
walk through them with you. So A is delta card. Magically. It will be red

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:57.880
or black. and, the probability of it being red or black is 50% each. Okay?

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:58.570
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.300
&gt;&gt; Right. So we have a uniform prior over, over the

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:06.120
color. Now, remember red is bad for A and black is good

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:12.380
for A. So, it's going to turn out without loss of generality, that if A gets

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.200
a black card, A's definitely going to hold onto

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.030
the card. Okay? Now A gets this card.

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.930
B, player B, does not get to see the card. A can choose to either resign or to

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:27.190
hold. If A resigns given a red card, then he looses 20 cents. Okay?

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.430
&gt;&gt; Okay. Wait. So A's dealt red. A may resign if

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:32.290
but only if red.

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:33.260
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:34.890
&gt;&gt; And then A loses 20 cents.

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:35.770
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:37.400
&gt;&gt; Okay. Alright, okay.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.530
&gt;&gt; Okay, so this is a betting game. It's not strange it makes perfect

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:45.760
sense its sort of a metaphor for life. Now A can choose to hold instead,

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.800
hold the card. Thus requiring B to do something. So if A holds the card B can

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:56.700
either resign or can demand to see the card. Now if B resigns

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.230
then A gets 10 cents. Regardless of the color of the card. Okay?

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:01.240
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.360
&gt;&gt; That make sense?

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.910
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.730
&gt;&gt; Okay. Now if B chooses to see the card, in fact demands to

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:11.000
see the card. Then if the card is red, then A loses 40 cents. But

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.770
if the card is black, then A gets 30 cents. And since we're betting, this

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:19.500
means that whatever A wins, B loses and vice versa. That makes it zero sum.

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:20.590
&gt;&gt; Got it.

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:21.640
&gt;&gt; Okay, is this all make sense?

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:22.420
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.030
don't know if I can hold all those different numbers in

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.760
my head. But I, but the basic pattern of it is,

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.920
that as you say Red is, red is bad, black is

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.680
good. If A gets a bad card, A can essentially either fold

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:35.465
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:03:35.465 --> 00:03:39.060
&gt;&gt; Right, resign? Or kind of bluff, like hey I've

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.070
got this great card and then A and if

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.470
B believes that the card is bad then and

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.660
calls A or, or, or, and, and just folds then,

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:52.680
then A gets, A wins that. But if B says no I think

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.260
maybe you're bluffing and calls him, then

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.470
everybody's rewards are more extreme, I guess.

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:00.850
&gt;&gt; &gt;Exactly. So it's just a version of poker. A weird version of poker.

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:04.180
Simple version of poker. But a version of poker, none the less. There's a

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:05.940
minor little detail here which isn't that

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.930
important, but you know, notice it's written

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:13.270
that A will A may resign if its red. Basically, A will never resign

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:14.870
on a black card. Because it just doesn't

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:17.140
make any sense. And so there's really, it just,

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:19.240
there's not point in riding it out. Okay.

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:22.950
Because black is always good, sort of, nothing bad

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:26.160
can ever happen to A, if A gets a black card. So there's really sort of no

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.970
point in riding anything out. But that's just

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.750
a minor detail. Regardless these are the rules. Okay?

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:31.460
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:32.570
&gt;&gt; You got it? Sure.

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:36.530
&gt;&gt; I'm going to re-draw this as a game tree which might make

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:39.120
it a little easier to keep all the rules in your head.
