IT'S NOT SELLING THE WAY WE

THE BOTTOM LINE IS, BEING A

00:06:41.733 --> 00:06:44.703 align:start position:0% line:91%
MARINE REQUIRES A PERSONAL LEVEL
OF PHYSICAL FITNESS.

00:06:44.736 --> 00:06:48.707 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND EVEN RAY MABUS, WHO RUNS THE
MARINES, BELIEVES THAT.

TO THE JOB MARINES HAVE TO DO,
AND YOU ADHERE TO THEM, HE SAID.

IT DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER THE

ARE MALE OR FEMALE.
