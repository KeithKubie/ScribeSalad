00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:03.570
&gt;&gt;Rick Needham: Thanks everyone for coming
in today.

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:09.600
It's a gorgeous day outside, so I know it's
a tough draw to pull you indoors.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.900
Hopefully everyone's had a chance to go look
around outside about all the Earth Day activities

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.330
that are going on out there.

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.320
You've got vendor booths, partner booths,
some informational booths.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.789
We even have out own internal teams that have
their own little booths.

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:25.000
A ride-and-drive, and stuff like that.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.750
But I'd love to introduce you to Dan Yates.

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.730
I'm Rick Needham, I'm part of our Energy and
Sustainability team here at Google.

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.420
One of the many teams that focuses on sustainability.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:43.210
And I have the pleasure of introducing you
to Dan, who's a really interesting guy.

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:48.649
He's obviously founded and is currently CEO
of Opower, which is a company that's developing

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:54.180
home management, energy management software
that actually is connected with over somewhere

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.579
in the order of 10 to 15 million people, homes
already.

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:03.941
That's quite an extensive reach that they
have in North America, the UK.

00:01:03.941 --> 00:01:07.590
They've saved enough power already to power
the Empire State Building for something like

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:08.590
10 years.

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.020
Not a small amount of savings already.

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.149
Pretty amazing.

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:17.749
Before Opower, Dan actually had founded an
educational software company called Edusoft,

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:21.950
ended up selling that, and then embarking
on this trip which I think he'll talk a little

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:23.950
bit about, which sounds really cool to me.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.229
One day I'd love to do it, too.

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.650
It went from the Arctic Circle up in Alaska
all the way down to the southern tip of South

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:30.650
America.

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:32.740
At first, I thought it was biking, and he
said, "No, no, no, it's actually driving.

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.409
We drove a car."

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.209
But that's still quite an amazing trip.

00:01:36.209 --> 00:01:40.599
And on that trip, that's when he realized
he wanted to dedicate his professional career

00:01:40.599 --> 00:01:48.240
to helping maintain the wild places in the
world, and dedicate himself to sustainability.

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.460
He's also been cited many times, several awards
too.

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.609
He's won the Ernst and Young Entrepreneur
of the Year award.

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:58.359
In the greater Washington area has been a
Tech Titan, which sounds like a really cool

00:01:58.359 --> 00:02:02.959
label three years in a row.

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:03.959
Awesome.

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:07.459
[laughter] And so, something else I found
out at lunch is that Dan's also a consummate

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:08.459
hula-hooper.

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.170
Unfortunately, I wasn't able to procure a
hula-hoop in time for the talk.

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.709
&gt;&gt;Dan Hayes: Such a shame.

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:15.709
&gt;&gt;Rick: He didn't tell me in time.

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:16.709
Now it's too late.

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:19.159
But if we run out of good questions, which
I hope we don't, you can always ask about

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:21.780
how he became a good hula-hooper.

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.870
But please join me in welcoming Dan.

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.689
&gt;&gt;Dan Hayes: That was a little Stephen Colbert
moment, right?

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:27.689
&gt;&gt;Rick: Was it?

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:28.689
Yeah, okay.

00:02:28.689 --> 00:02:29.689
Thank you, Dan.

00:02:29.689 --> 00:02:31.400
Okay, thanks, Dan, whoo!

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.790
Please join me in welcoming Dan Yates to Google.

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.610
[applause]

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.489
&gt;&gt;Dan Yates: Thanks a lot.

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:42.569
It's good to be here.

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:46.239
I actually just realized: is there any clicker
capability?

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:47.950
'Cause otherwise I will be married to the--.

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.069
No clicker.

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:51.140
Okay.

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.361
I will stand here behind the podium for most
of this.

00:02:53.361 --> 00:02:56.739
Unless this is going-- no, it will not.

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:57.739
Okay.

00:02:57.739 --> 00:02:58.739
Well, good.

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:01.090
I'm happy to be here.

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:08.909
I'm excited to be here on Earth Day and honored
to be invited to talk.

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:10.640
Better than Halloween, I guess.

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.340
I was thinking about what I should talk about.

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.760
Some of you probably know a little bit about
Opower already.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.280
I'll give you a quick overview and then over
the course of this presentation tell a little

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.940
bit more about the company.

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:29.810
I was thinking about Earth Day as a day where
we're all supposed to be trying to take a

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:33.939
day to think about how we can do more to help
the environment.

00:03:33.939 --> 00:03:41.340
As I was thinking about that, and I've been
thinking about recently that the evolution

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.219
and the progression of clean tech companies
over the last 5 years since I got into this

00:03:45.219 --> 00:03:46.219
business.

00:03:46.219 --> 00:03:51.170
It hit me that there was a theme that I wanted
to talk about.

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:56.250
What I want to do is I want to tell a story
of incremental improvement.

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:06.579
I want to talk not about revolutionary improvement,
but evolutionary improvement.

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:12.740
When I started Opower, there were all these
big, fast-growing clean tech companies: in

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:14.379
solar, in wind, in biofuels.

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:16.329
Many of these companies haven't panned out.

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:20.109
I went through this period of about 3 or 4
years where I was really disappointed to see

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:26.830
there weren't a lot of other companies even
chasing after Opower or doing other-- successfully

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:30.949
building clean tech companies and having an
impact.

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:33.120
And that started to change in the last few
years.

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.490
There's been a second surge of companies.

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:40.509
If you tune into this, you'll hear a lot of
talk about how these new clean tech companies,

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:43.509
many of them are focused on efficiency, like
Opower.

00:04:43.509 --> 00:04:46.669
But there's a lot of talk also how they're
very capital efficient.

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:49.860
They don't need $500 million to get going.

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.889
That is a very important precursor, I think,
to successfully building a company.

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:56.699
If you need a half million dollars to get
it going, you're going to have a very few

00:04:56.699 --> 00:04:58.850
number of businesses that are going to get
off the ground.

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:03.699
But I think that the story, the thing that
has been last talked about, which I actually

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:08.419
think is one of the most important ones, is
this difference of not trying to boil the

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:12.860
ocean, but looking for incremental improvements
that, when you add them up, actually end up

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:16.169
being really massive.

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:22.670
When I think about Opower, that's the story
of our success.

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:28.370
Let me start at the beginning and tell you
how this came to be, hopefully, in the process,

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:29.370
carry you through this.

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:32.220
Hey Eric, good to see you there.

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:37.770
[laughs] I see a lot of faces in the audience
that I recognize.

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:42.010
But hopefully carry you through and see this
story of incrementalism.

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:48.090
It all started, as described, with a trip
through the Americas starting at the very

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:49.400
top and ending at the very bottom.

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:54.060
This photo here is me and my wife as we were
in Bolivia.

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:56.460
One of the highest points of the trip.

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:00.349
It's something like 16,000 feet.

00:06:00.349 --> 00:06:01.349
So we took this trip.

00:06:01.349 --> 00:06:03.820
We drove for about a year, heading south.

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:08.759
It was easy to get directions.

00:06:08.759 --> 00:06:10.199
We went on the trip just to have fun.

00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:13.720
I'd sold my last company, an educational software
company.

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:20.270
And I grew up camping and liked backpacking
but wasn't environmentally minded in terms

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:22.270
of what I wanted to do with the rest of my
life.

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:26.009
I still say I don't know the difference between
the horned owl and the spotted owl and I probably

00:06:26.009 --> 00:06:27.360
won't ever.

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:30.410
But we went on this trip to have a great time,
and we did.

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:32.169
We saw the things that we thought we were
going to see.

00:06:32.169 --> 00:06:40.030
We saw beautiful animals, we saw this vicuña
in the Bolivian Altiplano, a rare cousin of

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:41.030
a llama.

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:43.520
We saw these amazing forest canopies.

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:47.880
I love this photo because it's just so amazing,
the efficiency with which these trees grow

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:52.800
together, yet just stop growing right where
the other one takes over and capture all the

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:54.819
sunlight.

00:06:54.819 --> 00:06:55.819
We had a great time.

00:06:55.819 --> 00:06:59.300
We also did a lot of fun tourist stuff.

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:07.450
But in the process, we saw a lot of the reality
of what it's like out there in the rest of

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:08.450
the world.

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:15.470
I left on this trip with this naive picture
that the US was the most inhabited, most developed

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:16.470
country.

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:19.470
In reality, when you go through the rest of
the Americas, it's not true.

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:22.050
We actually have some pretty rich wildlands
that are well protected.

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:24.300
There are other countries that are totally
devastated.

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:29.909
They're not devastated because these guys--
these are not bad guys, these are just poor

00:07:29.909 --> 00:07:34.290
people who are trying to incrementally eke
out a living.

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:39.020
Unfortunately, their incremental steps are
working against the environment.

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:45.939
So I came back feeling very viscerally how
at risk and fragile the environment is.

00:07:45.939 --> 00:07:50.159
I'm not going to spend any more time talking
about this point, because I'm quite confident

00:07:50.159 --> 00:07:56.070
that everyone here in this room knows how
at risk and fragile the environment is.

00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:59.400
But this is a key part of my story.

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:04.120
This is when, for me, it became really visceral
because I couldn't-- After this trip, I no

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:07.650
longer had to envision it or imagine it, I
could remember it.

00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:12.800
I could remember all the spots where I saw
the fragility and I saw how at risk the environment

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:15.590
was.

00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:19.789
When I came back, I thought about what I should
do.

00:08:19.789 --> 00:08:24.800
Basically asked myself the simple question,
"What do we suck at here?"

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:27.110
And the answer was pretty clear.

00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:33.060
At the end of the day, where we're by far
doing the worst is that we use a lot of dirty

00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:34.980
energy.

00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:38.700
I wanted to figure out what I could do to
have an impact.

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:40.610
This is 2006.

00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:46.510
There was actually a lot of energy, pun intended,
clearly.

00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:51.120
I was living in San Francisco, surrounded
by entrepreneurs talking about clean tech.

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:55.070
We were getting -- There was a lot of progress
on wind development.

00:08:55.070 --> 00:09:00.000
There was a lot of progress on new solar:
with the utility scale solar here but also

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.150
residential solar is taking off.

00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:05.710
The very first inklings of electric vehicles.

00:09:05.710 --> 00:09:11.350
These things all seemed so full of potential,
and they are full of potential.

00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:17.300
I was living in San Francisco, working out
of this tiny home office, and I downloaded

00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:21.780
this graph, which was from the DOE, or the
Energy Information Agency.

00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:27.590
This is a wonky little picture that I actually
just found an updated version of this morning.

00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:29.480
Well, almost updated.

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:31.130
2010 anyhow.

00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:32.610
This is how we use energy in the US.

00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:38.000
On the left, you've got all the sources of
the generation.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.790
And then on the right, you have all the consumption.

00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:45.380
It hit me, 'cause I had this thing literally
just taped on the wall next to my computer,

00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:50.560
that every single person I was talking to
that was innovating in clean tech-- I'd gone

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:53.200
to the big solar conference in San Jose.

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:56.960
It was the second annual conference, and there
were thousands of people there, and Governor

00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:58.480
Schwarzenegger came and talked.

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:01.180
There was just so much enthusiasm for this.

00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:06.070
Absolutely every innovation and idea that
was being discussed was over here.

00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:08.150
There was no one talking about the right side.

00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:13.800
I really actually think it was thanks to this
diagram that I could just see so plainly there

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:17.140
was this gap missing, this hole.

00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:22.970
I just started to ask simply, "What about
just using less energy?

00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:25.570
What can we do there?

00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:28.450
Why aren't people focusing on this problem?"

00:10:28.450 --> 00:10:32.120
I'm somewhat of a contrarian, so it gave me
a lot of pleasure to think that nobody was

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:33.650
thinking about this problem.

00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:39.430
I didn't have an idea yet, but I knew that
there was some open space to hunt around.

00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:42.200
So Mackenzie has done a very nice job.

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:47.590
This is actually-- Their studies came out
after we started Opower, but quantifying just

00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:49.230
how much energy is being wasted.

00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:51.650
It is astonishing.

00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:57.220
Just looking at residential energy use in
the US, at wasted energy between now and 2020,

00:10:57.220 --> 00:11:04.180
we're going to waste $400 billion of energy,
which is almost 5 trillion pounds of CO2 and

00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:06.330
3.4 million gigawatt hours of energy.

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:12.780
This is not energy wasted because you bought
an extra TV, which you could argue is energy

00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:13.780
wasted.

00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:18.170
But this is energy wasted by your TV that
you bought when you're not using it.

00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:22.520
Energy wasted by your air conditioner that
you're running when you're not home and is

00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:24.550
making no one more comfortable.

00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:28.160
It's just a tremendous amount of waste that's
sitting there.

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:36.450
So I couldn't help-- So it felt big and unattended,
but then the important question is: why?

00:11:36.450 --> 00:11:39.020
Why are people wasting all this energy?

00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:40.170
It seems like a no-brainer.

00:11:40.170 --> 00:11:42.980
This is energy that, if saved, will actually
save money.

00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:45.340
You don't even have to care about the environment
to save this energy.

00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:48.340
This isn't like solar where it's more expensive
than coal.

00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:51.670
This is just not wasting money and energy.

00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:55.420
No one's winning.

00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:56.890
Here are some of the reasons why.

00:11:56.890 --> 00:12:03.600
6 minutes, 6 minutes is the average amount
of time that an American spends thinking about

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:06.080
energy use in a year.

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:10.880
[sighs] We all-- Most of us here, probably
unwilling to admit it, but most of us here

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:15.400
probably think about Justin Bieber more than
we think about our energy use on an annual

00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:16.630
basis.

00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:19.550
It's just completely not paid attention to.

00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:22.820
The reason why is-- There's a couple reasons.

00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:23.820
First one is it's boring.

00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:26.530
It's just not a fun thing to think about.

00:12:26.530 --> 00:12:33.120
The second thing, which is the more fundamental
problem, is that it's inexpensive.

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:40.060
The average American home spends only 1.7%
of their annual income on electricity.

00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:49.130
If you save 25% on your energy bill, that's
like 0.45% impact on your overall expenditures

00:12:49.130 --> 00:12:50.700
for the year.

00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:54.270
It's just not a big deal.

00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:59.950
So it's boring, it's inexpensive, and the
last thing is, is there's just no feedback

00:12:59.950 --> 00:13:01.100
mechanism.

00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:04.471
This is a programmable thermostat, one of
many crummy ones out there.

00:13:04.471 --> 00:13:12.470
There are a great companies, including Opower,
that are now working to make these thermostats

00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:14.600
much, much more user friendly.

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:18.200
But today, the average programmable thermostat
is not programmed.

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:20.680
In fact, 80% of them are not programmed.

00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:25.950
And almost nobody remembers to turn off the
air conditioner when they leave the house.

00:13:25.950 --> 00:13:27.210
Why is that?

00:13:27.210 --> 00:13:30.441
They're hard to program, but they're not that
hard to program, and you can save a lot of

00:13:30.441 --> 00:13:31.441
money doing it.

00:13:31.441 --> 00:13:32.441
It's 'cause there's no feedback.

00:13:32.441 --> 00:13:35.950
You don't feel bad when you leave the house
and the thermostat isn't programmed.

00:13:35.950 --> 00:13:40.710
What I've liked to say for a long time is
if CO2 were purple and it smelled like rotten

00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:43.220
eggs, we wouldn't have an energy problem.

00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:47.050
You would turn off your thermostat because
your house would stink if you didn't, your

00:13:47.050 --> 00:13:51.440
neighbors would see it and get angry, you'd
have the hassle of the purple smoke.

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:53.650
But there is no feedback.

00:13:53.650 --> 00:13:56.860
There's no emotional connection to this.

00:13:56.860 --> 00:13:58.600
It isn't visceral.

00:13:58.600 --> 00:13:59.600
It's not that expensive.

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:04.780
And so we all just plow along and we waste
our $400 billion worth of electricity.

00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:06.240
Okay.

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:09.430
So these are all problems, right?

00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:13.030
So how do we fix this?

00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:16.090
How do we correct these misconceptions?

00:14:16.090 --> 00:14:20.330
I was looking at this, thinking about these
different ideas, and I was very fortunate

00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:27.210
to run across this study by Robert Cialdini,
who is a world-renown behavioral psychologist.

00:14:27.210 --> 00:14:34.110
He's written a book called Influence that's
prescribed reading at the GSB and at Harvard

00:14:34.110 --> 00:14:40.580
Business School, published in a dozen languages
internationally.

00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:42.710
He had just done this study.

00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:49.680
What he was trying to do was he was trying
to figure out how to get people to take an

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:52.820
environmental action, and figure out what
would motivate people to save energy.

00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:54.300
So here's the study he did.

00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:59.720
He was in San Marcos, CA, a suburb of San
Diego, and he was trying to get people to

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:03.990
turn off their air conditioner and turn on
their fan in the evening.

00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:06.190
He had a bunch of grad students working for
him.

00:15:06.190 --> 00:15:09.370
They went around and printed up all these
door hangers.

00:15:09.370 --> 00:15:11.450
They went door to door.

00:15:11.450 --> 00:15:12.720
They hung these things on the doors.

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:14.070
And they had different treatments.

00:15:14.070 --> 00:15:17.510
They had a control where they actually had
two different varieties of control.

00:15:17.510 --> 00:15:22.390
There was very statistically significant,
well-structured academic study.

00:15:22.390 --> 00:15:27.080
They would read the meters in each of the
homes after they had hung up these door hangers

00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:28.730
to see if they were having an impact.

00:15:28.730 --> 00:15:33.321
The first treatment was monetary: "You know,
you could save 50 bucks every month if you

00:15:33.321 --> 00:15:35.190
turn off your AC and switch to a fan."

00:15:35.190 --> 00:15:38.570
Second one was environmental: "Help save the
environment.

00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:39.570
Keep the sky clean.

00:15:39.570 --> 00:15:42.010
Take xyz pounds of CO2 out of the air.

00:15:42.010 --> 00:15:44.890
Just turn off your AC and switch to a fan
in the evening."

00:15:44.890 --> 00:15:47.810
Third message was a societal, citizenship.

00:15:47.810 --> 00:15:53.320
"Save money for future-- Help conserve resources
for future generations.

00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:56.060
Turn off your AC and switch to a fan in the
evening."

00:15:56.060 --> 00:16:00.390
They did this week after week all summer long.

00:16:00.390 --> 00:16:01.650
These groups, zero impact.

00:16:01.650 --> 00:16:03.860
It was as if they had not been there.

00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:06.950
And this is about as expensive a marketing
campaign as you can do.

00:16:06.950 --> 00:16:12.030
No company can afford to go door to door,
even with grad students, hanging door hangers

00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:13.440
every week.

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:19.550
If we can't get people to do some simple no-cost
behavioral change with this kind of marketing,

00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:21.480
nothing's going to work.

00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:22.480
But wait!

00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:25.280
There was one more treatment.

00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:27.460
Make room for it.

00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:33.050
There was a simple last door hanger that said,
"In a recent survey of your neighbors, 75%

00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:35.800
of them turn off their AC and switch to a
fan in the evening.

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:37.810
Join your neighbors.

00:16:37.810 --> 00:16:40.340
Turn off your AC, switch to a fan in the evening."

00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:43.900
This group saved 6%.

00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:47.002
This sustained throughout the duration of
the study, all through the summer.

00:16:47.002 --> 00:16:49.790
What does this mean?

00:16:49.790 --> 00:16:54.640
It means that people benchmark to the norm.

00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:57.680
We know this in a lot of other circumstances.

00:16:57.680 --> 00:17:00.510
But this is a really powerful tool.

00:17:00.510 --> 00:17:03.230
It's actually a very rational thing for us
to do.

00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:08.759
The instinct that we all have when we hear
this is "keeping up with the Joneses."

00:17:08.759 --> 00:17:12.669
We like to keep up with the Joneses and we've
all been taught by our moms and dads not to

00:17:12.669 --> 00:17:16.019
keep up with the Joneses because it's not
how you're supposed to live your life.

00:17:16.019 --> 00:17:23.110
But the reality is that if you're operating
in a complex environment like energy usage,

00:17:23.110 --> 00:17:24.770
you don't know much about it.

00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:27.409
You don't want to be an expert: most people
don't.

00:17:27.409 --> 00:17:30.960
Benchmarking to what the wisdom of the crowd
says is actually a really good shortcut for

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:33.509
figuring out whether or not you're in line.

00:17:33.509 --> 00:17:37.990
Whether you're doing what you ought to be
doing or living your life the way that is

00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:41.429
most reasonable.

00:17:41.429 --> 00:17:44.149
We see norms throughout our lives.

00:17:44.149 --> 00:17:48.330
We have these buffoonish guys who are all
very happy with themselves because they all

00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:50.519
look like each other and they're not ashamed
of it.

00:17:50.519 --> 00:17:53.490
But you put one of them in this room, they
might feel a little awkward.

00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:59.580
And then you have, on the nicer side of the
spectrum, women in beautiful saris.

00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:05.580
No one here is wearing a sari today, but this
is absolutely a norm that is-- and they're

00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:07.990
all almost wearing the same color sari, actually.

00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:16.830
That is totally established in other parts
of the world, and totally normal and beautiful.

00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:21.970
If we had norms like this about energy use,
we'd probably all start wearing the same energy

00:18:21.970 --> 00:18:25.100
clothes and start drafting off of each other.

00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:29.149
But there is no signals.

00:18:29.149 --> 00:18:31.309
Most people don't know if they're efficient
or not.

00:18:31.309 --> 00:18:38.269
To me, the data that-- the graph that has
most illustrated this for me is this graph,

00:18:38.269 --> 00:18:42.250
which I have not labeled, so you have to wait
with bated breath for me to explain what it

00:18:42.250 --> 00:18:44.220
is.

00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:45.899
We have a ton of data.

00:18:45.899 --> 00:18:52.529
We have almost half of the US energy data
under management in our colocation facilities,

00:18:52.529 --> 00:18:56.120
Edipower, because we work with most of the
major utilities in the US.

00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:59.900
When we work with them, the first thing they
do is they send us all their consumer energy

00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:00.900
data.

00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:03.399
We've been able to do some really interesting
analytics.

00:19:03.399 --> 00:19:08.070
What we looked at, and this is actually something
we did from the very beginning, is we looked

00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:14.919
at: how dispersed is the energy consumption
of a set of similar homes in the same neighborhood?

00:19:14.919 --> 00:19:23.320
Taking for each home the hundred closest homes
of similar square footage of closest proximity--

00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:29.429
basically an algorithm that weights your distance
in real distance with your distance in terms

00:19:29.429 --> 00:19:34.730
of house size, and tries to find the minimally
distant set of homes.

00:19:34.730 --> 00:19:38.059
How different is consumption across those
homes?

00:19:38.059 --> 00:19:40.730
This is the graph that we get no matter where
we do it.

00:19:40.730 --> 00:19:46.420
What it basically comes out is that in any
given home, in any given neighborhood, more

00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:51.919
than 30%-- more than 50% of the homes are
further than 30% from the mean.

00:19:51.919 --> 00:19:55.940
You get this big dispersion of energy use.

00:19:55.940 --> 00:20:03.190
To me, the signal that-- What this signifies
is a couple things.

00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:07.830
First, everything I just said: energy use
is-- there is no feedback, and people are

00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:13.970
drifting off on their own trajectories of
consumption, some using more, some using less.

00:20:13.970 --> 00:20:19.129
The second thing is that energy use is elastic,
because if there's this much variability within

00:20:19.129 --> 00:20:24.580
similar homes in similar areas, there must
be an opportunity to reduce their usage.

00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:28.210
This is what gave me a lot of the confidence
early on when we started the company that

00:20:28.210 --> 00:20:33.720
there would be an opportunity to change the
norms and to move behaviors.

00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:35.490
The opportunity was clear.

00:20:35.490 --> 00:20:41.340
Thanks to the study by Robert Cialdini and
some research that we did on how energy efficiency

00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:42.340
markets work.

00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:46.630
There's about a $10 billion a year energy
efficiency market internationally.

00:20:46.630 --> 00:20:50.990
We ran some math and realized that if we could
make-- if we could change behavior by a few

00:20:50.990 --> 00:20:54.100
percent, we could actually have a real business.

00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:56.399
So where do we start?

00:20:56.399 --> 00:20:57.399
Here.

00:20:57.399 --> 00:20:58.399
We started with the utility bill.

00:20:58.399 --> 00:21:03.450
This is your typical craptastic utility bill.

00:21:03.450 --> 00:21:06.650
[laughter] Barely tells you how much you owe.

00:21:06.650 --> 00:21:09.789
It gives you-- this is actually a real bill.

00:21:09.789 --> 00:21:15.830
I think we cut off the name of the utility
to save their reputation, but you've got the

00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:21.190
price of natural gas to 8 decimal points,
just for good measure.

00:21:21.190 --> 00:21:26.740
And yet, no useful information to really help
you figure anything else out about your usage

00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:29.190
other than how much you owe.

00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:34.809
So this felt like a big opportunity to improve,
and we applied all the lessons from that study

00:21:34.809 --> 00:21:41.730
and our own best practices from direct marketing
and software analytics to deliver this first

00:21:41.730 --> 00:21:42.730
product.

00:21:42.730 --> 00:21:47.049
This was Opower's home energy report.

00:21:47.049 --> 00:21:52.549
We did our first program with SMUD, just up
in Sacramento nearby.

00:21:52.549 --> 00:21:57.090
We started sending home these mailers that
showed people how their energy use compared

00:21:57.090 --> 00:22:02.179
to their neighbors, to their approximately
hundred occupied homes that are similar in

00:22:02.179 --> 00:22:04.070
size.

00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:11.129
We gave-- Alex Eagle here actually wrote a
lot of the energy calculator code that made

00:22:11.129 --> 00:22:14.950
this first report possible.

00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:15.950
We sent these out.

00:22:15.950 --> 00:22:19.559
We set it up as a clinical trial with a test
and control groups so that we were able to

00:22:19.559 --> 00:22:22.600
exactly measure the impact.

00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:26.780
And we started to get these great results.

00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:30.269
Here are many results now from many of our
utility programs.

00:22:30.269 --> 00:22:36.169
Each line represents the difference between
the average consumption of the control group

00:22:36.169 --> 00:22:38.059
minus the test group.

00:22:38.059 --> 00:22:41.910
We've consistently been getting this 1.5-3.5%
reduction.

00:22:41.910 --> 00:22:44.960
It's gone on now for over 4 years.

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:50.309
Every year, we tend to see a slight increment
in savings of these groups as they progress

00:22:50.309 --> 00:22:57.240
and customers accumulate some energy saving
measures that are long lasting like somebody

00:22:57.240 --> 00:23:00.350
replaces a refrigerator, etcetera.

00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:04.320
Important to our business model, which is
not as important to the environment but is

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:10.370
important to our longevity: when you turn
off this program, the savings diminish.

00:23:10.370 --> 00:23:14.220
Once you use us, you're hooked.

00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:20.110
But the thing that I also want to flag-- and
these are just some of the groups that have

00:23:20.110 --> 00:23:23.299
certified are results, the third parties that
have evaluated it.

00:23:23.299 --> 00:23:28.780
But the thing that I want to highlight is:
1.5-3.5% doesn't seem like that much, right?

00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:30.130
It isn't.

00:23:30.130 --> 00:23:33.279
For a consumer, if I were selling it to you,
you wouldn't be disinterested, you wouldn't

00:23:33.279 --> 00:23:34.279
buy it.

00:23:34.279 --> 00:23:38.429
Luckily, our business is we sell to utilities,
they buy blocks of hundreds of thousands or

00:23:38.429 --> 00:23:42.169
millions of homes and we deliver it and it's
free to the consumer.

00:23:42.169 --> 00:23:46.090
But for an average consumer, this isn't a
big impact.

00:23:46.090 --> 00:23:49.870
I'll get back to that in a few slides, 'cause
I want to show you how much this has added

00:23:49.870 --> 00:23:52.490
up to.

00:23:52.490 --> 00:23:57.429
We started with this normative comparison,
but behavioral science was just the beginning.

00:23:57.429 --> 00:24:01.980
We immediately started to look to analytics
and what we could do with personalized recommendations.

00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:08.070
I just want to highlight-- I'll touch on just
a couple of the neat things that we do, and

00:24:08.070 --> 00:24:12.929
then I'll bring this speech to a close and
we can talk further.

00:24:12.929 --> 00:24:15.830
This is one of the features that I really,
really like.

00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:21.179
What we do is-- We are now-- We don't have
Google-sized data, but we have some pretty

00:24:21.179 --> 00:24:22.179
big data.

00:24:22.179 --> 00:24:25.639
We're running it all on a Hadoop grid.

00:24:25.639 --> 00:24:31.679
We've custom developed a batch processing
system that sits on top of it because we need

00:24:31.679 --> 00:24:36.990
perfect reliability and restartability of
our batch jobs because we're not just running

00:24:36.990 --> 00:24:39.230
large scale approximate analytics.

00:24:39.230 --> 00:24:44.820
We have to get results for every single customer
and get it right every single time.

00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:47.630
We've got this system that's pretty slick.

00:24:47.630 --> 00:24:51.090
A data platform that we've built.

00:24:51.090 --> 00:24:55.409
What we do on it is we're able to run this
multivariate regression analysis where we

00:24:55.409 --> 00:25:00.499
can separate out-- Using your smart meter
data and the local weather data stream, the

00:25:00.499 --> 00:25:05.240
hourly data stream, using both temperature
and humidity, we're able to separate out the

00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:09.879
parts of your usage, the biggest piece of
your usage: your heating, your cooling, your

00:25:09.879 --> 00:25:13.840
baseload, which is the stuff that's on all
the time, and then everything else.

00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:18.679
With that, we're able to do things like send
you this, whether it's in the mail or on our

00:25:18.679 --> 00:25:20.360
website.

00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:25.269
Or when you call in, have the CSR at the utility
tell you how your heating usage compares to

00:25:25.269 --> 00:25:26.269
the average.

00:25:26.269 --> 00:25:31.200
This becomes incredibly valuable because we
can start to focus you on where you need to

00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:36.220
be-- what actions you need to be taking.

00:25:36.220 --> 00:25:38.500
This shows up on our webportal.

00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:44.179
We have a breakdown and we bring you to the
first most important part of your usage.

00:25:44.179 --> 00:25:51.759
We direct that immediately to recommendations
and we've partnered with retailers and other

00:25:51.759 --> 00:25:55.470
third parties to connect this to actions.

00:25:55.470 --> 00:26:00.880
Trying to really draw this whole flow through,
we've identified an opportunity, we motivate

00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:04.519
you, we explain to you what it is, and then
we say, "Hey look, here's the action that

00:26:04.519 --> 00:26:07.919
you can take to insulate your home."

00:26:07.919 --> 00:26:10.789
This is where Opower has grown.

00:26:10.789 --> 00:26:16.289
We started with this report, and now we have
this whole platform, this customer-centric

00:26:16.289 --> 00:26:21.049
experience as we talked to the utilities about
it.

00:26:21.049 --> 00:26:24.879
For us consumers, it's just suddenly the utility
actually got smart and is giving you all the

00:26:24.879 --> 00:26:29.840
stuff they should be giving you, that makes
energy information easy and digestible.

00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:33.570
We have the reports like I showed, we have
a social app that we just launched, we have

00:26:33.570 --> 00:26:37.999
this great outage and alerts platform so we
can give you, preemptively, a notification

00:26:37.999 --> 00:26:42.169
if you're on track for a high bill before
you get the high bill.

00:26:42.169 --> 00:26:45.830
We have all these consumer marketing features
like this coupon I just showed.

00:26:45.830 --> 00:26:49.950
We're launching an API platform and mobile
apps, and we have this great website.

00:26:49.950 --> 00:26:54.649
Now, also, we're doing in partnership with
Honeywell Thermostat, where we're giving people

00:26:54.649 --> 00:27:01.499
the ability to control their usage much more
easily using an Android or iPhone app.

00:27:01.499 --> 00:27:03.299
This is what our company has turned into.

00:27:03.299 --> 00:27:09.429
But the reason I want to tell you this is
I started with this simple idea.

00:27:09.429 --> 00:27:13.769
We identified a blank space and we looked
for making an incremental improvement.

00:27:13.769 --> 00:27:18.519
And we did make that improvement, and it steamrolled,
and it snowballed, rather.

00:27:18.519 --> 00:27:22.509
You can't do both.

00:27:22.509 --> 00:27:24.299
Here's where we are today.

00:27:24.299 --> 00:27:31.309
We've saved 900 gigawatt hours, almost a terawatt
hour of energy, which I was just hearing is

00:27:31.309 --> 00:27:35.039
about half of what Google uses on an annual
basis.

00:27:35.039 --> 00:27:39.869
So in which we all think Google's being a
pretty big power consumer and we're saving

00:27:39.869 --> 00:27:42.480
almost half what Google's generating or consuming.

00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:48.299
We've saved consumers $100 million, and that
turns into 650,000 tons of CO2.

00:27:48.299 --> 00:27:57.230
But all of these reference points, to me,
are not as clear or compelling as this one:

00:27:57.230 --> 00:28:02.299
last year, we saved as much energy as half
of the entire US solar industry.

00:28:02.299 --> 00:28:07.919
We think of solar as this non-incremental,
transformative, turn-everything-on-its-head

00:28:07.919 --> 00:28:08.919
technology.

00:28:08.919 --> 00:28:10.739
And it is.

00:28:10.739 --> 00:28:16.739
But we, with this incremental approach, have
saved one company half as much energy as all

00:28:16.739 --> 00:28:21.369
the solar companies combined did in the US
last year.

00:28:21.369 --> 00:28:26.749
If we ran what we do at Opower, it doesn't
have to be Opower, but our approach, worldwide,

00:28:26.749 --> 00:28:31.960
it would be 2011 coal-fired power plants that
we could shut down, which is a tremendous,

00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:36.409
tremendous amount of energy savings.

00:28:36.409 --> 00:28:39.710
This is my point: incrementalism is powerful.

00:28:39.710 --> 00:28:43.600
I think that there's so many opportunities
out there.

00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:48.239
On Earth Day, the reason why I picked this
as the theme is because when you think about

00:28:48.239 --> 00:28:54.700
the-- Earth Day is the day to think globally
and act locally.

00:28:54.700 --> 00:29:01.210
Opower is a company that in many ways gets
the pleasure to tally up all of the disparate

00:29:01.210 --> 00:29:04.419
thinking globally, acting locally actions
of our customers.

00:29:04.419 --> 00:29:07.830
We happen to be able to count it up and report
it out.

00:29:07.830 --> 00:29:12.749
But what we're really doing, fundamentally,
is motivating millions of people to make small

00:29:12.749 --> 00:29:15.169
changes, and it does make a difference.

00:29:15.169 --> 00:29:19.559
So that's my message for today.

00:29:19.559 --> 00:29:22.510
Thank you guys for taking the time to come
out.

00:29:22.510 --> 00:29:25.340
I'm happy to answer any questions.

00:29:25.340 --> 00:29:27.220
[applause]

00:29:27.220 --> 00:29:34.029
&gt;&gt;Male #1: [inaudible]Say the question is
about water.

00:29:34.029 --> 00:29:35.799
Do we have any opportunity there?

00:29:35.799 --> 00:29:36.799
&gt;&gt;Dan Yates: Yeah.

00:29:36.799 --> 00:29:37.799
Yeah, we definitely do.

00:29:37.799 --> 00:29:42.200
We actually work with, today we work with
both electricity and gas.

00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:44.320
We work with a bunch of utilities that serve
both.

00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:47.700
We were just talking about this at lunch.

00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:49.950
Water is an easy next step for us.

00:29:49.950 --> 00:29:59.460
The only reason we've been held back is that
there is just-- While the need is as obvious,

00:29:59.460 --> 00:30:03.539
the regulatory and policy infrastructure isn't
there, so the money isn't there.

00:30:03.539 --> 00:30:07.210
So it's very hard to find people who will
pay you to do it, and to build a business

00:30:07.210 --> 00:30:08.210
on it.

00:30:08.210 --> 00:30:11.470
What we have is a number of utilities who
actually provide all three.

00:30:11.470 --> 00:30:14.220
Like in Palo Alto, it's gas, electricity,
and water.

00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:16.659
I think they even do waste as well.

00:30:16.659 --> 00:30:20.830
So we're going to probably start reporting
on water for those utilities.

00:30:20.830 --> 00:30:23.220
But it's the same-- and there's another company.

00:30:23.220 --> 00:30:25.990
There's a company called waterSMART, I think,
that's trying to do this.

00:30:25.990 --> 00:30:31.080
I've heard them calling themselves "The Opower
of water" so I can presume that's what they're

00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:32.080
doing.

00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:37.799
&gt;&gt;Male #2: So in one of the slides you identified
opportunities for third party app developments

00:30:37.799 --> 00:30:39.739
though an API that you'll be offering.

00:30:39.739 --> 00:30:45.480
Just curious to hear any ideas you have on
what some of those apps might look like, and

00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:51.950
whether or not you think your company will
allow those apps to leverage the energy saving

00:30:51.950 --> 00:30:55.409
recommendations that you offer, because I
know that-- I mean, in my mind, there's a

00:30:55.409 --> 00:30:57.049
huge market for that.

00:30:57.049 --> 00:30:58.889
Just curious to hear what you think some of
these apps might look like.

00:30:58.889 --> 00:31:00.820
&gt;&gt;Dan Yates: So we're just getting started
on this.

00:31:00.820 --> 00:31:05.649
Actually, Wayne Lin, who is a former Googler,
who is our head of product management for

00:31:05.649 --> 00:31:12.691
this part of business, all of our web and
social and API strategy is here today, but

00:31:12.691 --> 00:31:14.200
he's not here in the audience.

00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:16.289
Otherwise I would just hand it over to him.

00:31:16.289 --> 00:31:19.160
There's a couple different things that we're
looking at.

00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:25.730
Our order of priority is actually starting
first with the enterprise, and then extending

00:31:25.730 --> 00:31:29.630
more and more to third party APIs.

00:31:29.630 --> 00:31:36.879
The first set, which we already have live,
is actually, ironically, just giving-- exposing

00:31:36.879 --> 00:31:41.559
the analyzed data back to our utility partners
because they don't have the wherewithal to

00:31:41.559 --> 00:31:44.379
do this kind of analytics on their own data.

00:31:44.379 --> 00:31:48.509
Second evolution for us is building an integration
framework.

00:31:48.509 --> 00:31:54.330
For other utility facing companies that want
to provide services to utilities, we can expose

00:31:54.330 --> 00:31:57.239
access to that data with utility permission.

00:31:57.239 --> 00:32:01.609
Then these providers don't have to integrate
and do all the heavy lifting that we do to

00:32:01.609 --> 00:32:02.799
connect with these utilities.

00:32:02.799 --> 00:32:10.070
And the third is connecting to third party--
is making it-- putting in place all of the

00:32:10.070 --> 00:32:14.419
permission and everything to authenticate
third parties and let consumers turn on and

00:32:14.419 --> 00:32:16.369
off different third party apps.

00:32:16.369 --> 00:32:21.760
Some of the examples that we have top of mind
are that we got-- Zillow reached out to us.

00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:26.919
They're actually very interested in being
able to manifest a certified last 12 months

00:32:26.919 --> 00:32:32.330
bill on any new home listings that somebody
can get credit for investing in energy efficiency.

00:32:32.330 --> 00:32:37.720
Mint are of a similar interest in being able
to help separate their pie chart of energy

00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:45.200
use to show you where your waste is within
your overall consumption, your expenditures.

00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:48.600
We've been talking to some weather websites
that are also interested.

00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:52.039
So that's been the areas where there's been
the most interest, but one of the APIs that

00:32:52.039 --> 00:32:55.809
we've just developed has been top tips.

00:32:55.809 --> 00:32:59.780
So exactly to your point, and I think that
there will be a lot of-- that actually is

00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:01.970
one of the things the weather companies are
interested in.

00:33:01.970 --> 00:33:03.359
"It's going to be hot!

00:33:03.359 --> 00:33:06.289
Here's top tips for you for saving energy
this summer."

00:33:06.289 --> 00:33:10.989
&gt;&gt;Female #1: How much customization do you
have to do for utilities who want different

00:33:10.989 --> 00:33:13.230
levels of engagement?

00:33:13.230 --> 00:33:17.499
Have you found that dealing with different
utility personalities has been a tricky part

00:33:17.499 --> 00:33:18.529
of the process?

00:33:18.529 --> 00:33:23.130
&gt;&gt;Dan Yates: So we are, at the end of the
day, whether I like it or not, an enterprise

00:33:23.130 --> 00:33:24.759
software service business.

00:33:24.759 --> 00:33:31.090
We deal with big enterprise customers who
write us huge checks and have every right

00:33:31.090 --> 00:33:37.220
to ask us to do things for them that, as a
consumer facing company, you would tell that

00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:40.280
consumer to go away or buy something else.

00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:46.009
The flip side is that enterprise customers
stick with you for a long time.

00:33:46.009 --> 00:33:49.899
It's a mutual partnership.

00:33:49.899 --> 00:33:52.590
So that sounds like a long way of me saying
we do allow customizations.

00:33:52.590 --> 00:33:54.799
We actually don't do a lot of customizations.

00:33:54.799 --> 00:34:01.359
We have built-- We do a lot of configuration,
and we've put a lot of configuration into

00:34:01.359 --> 00:34:02.820
our platform.

00:34:02.820 --> 00:34:07.930
The variants across utilities-- and increasingly
we've been better and better at this as we

00:34:07.930 --> 00:34:11.350
continue to invest in our technology.

00:34:11.350 --> 00:34:20.110
Utilities vary widely in what they've deployed
in terms of how many reports they've sent

00:34:20.110 --> 00:34:24.720
or whether they're system wide or not, but
in terms of the actual features themselves,

00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:28.570
we don't build a lot of custom applications
for partners.

00:34:28.570 --> 00:34:35.160
I mean, from a business model perspective,
we look in this part of our business at companies

00:34:35.160 --> 00:34:41.600
like salesforce dot com or other cloud-based
enterprise companies, where they've built

00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:47.790
really thoughtful platforms but then allow
configurability without having to write new

00:34:47.790 --> 00:34:48.790
code.

00:34:48.790 --> 00:34:50.669
Let the customer write the code.

00:34:50.669 --> 00:34:55.200
&gt;&gt;Female #2: It's likely that a lot of people
actually here already understand this.

00:34:55.200 --> 00:34:58.290
But you're partnering with a lot of the power
companies.

00:34:58.290 --> 00:35:02.620
I'm just not really getting why, what's motivating
them?

00:35:02.620 --> 00:35:03.860
&gt;&gt;Dan Yates: Why do utilities do this?

00:35:03.860 --> 00:35:06.470
&gt;&gt;Female #2: Yeah, what's the model there?

00:35:06.470 --> 00:35:09.280
&gt;&gt;Dan Yates: Mmhmm.

00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:11.150
Great question.

00:35:11.150 --> 00:35:14.310
[pause] There's a couple different answers.

00:35:14.310 --> 00:35:20.900
The way we started the business was very focused
on energy efficiency.

00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:27.410
Utilities have state mandates that require
them to hit these efficiency standards that

00:35:27.410 --> 00:35:30.320
are called energy efficiency resource standards.

00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:35.410
Basically every populous state in the US now
has a standard that these utilities are being

00:35:35.410 --> 00:35:36.520
held to.

00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:42.650
What happens is the utility commission in
each state will set a goal, a certain terawatt

00:35:42.650 --> 00:35:47.340
hour goal or gigawatt hour goal that we've
passed down pro rata to the utilities in that

00:35:47.340 --> 00:35:48.340
state.

00:35:48.340 --> 00:35:53.850
The utilities will then put together a portfolio
of programs that are proposed back to the

00:35:53.850 --> 00:35:55.290
commission every 3 years.

00:35:55.290 --> 00:36:01.420
Based upon the costs of those programs, they
will put a tax on the utility bill that funds

00:36:01.420 --> 00:36:03.930
these programs.

00:36:03.930 --> 00:36:08.200
That's been-- And from a utility perspective
in this regard, it's really compliance exercise.

00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:11.300
They don't have any stake in it, but they've
been mandated to do it.

00:36:11.300 --> 00:36:16.870
And they definitely adhere to commission mandates
because they commission is their one customer,

00:36:16.870 --> 00:36:20.940
really, where they get approval or denial
for building new things.

00:36:20.940 --> 00:36:25.940
That was the core value proposition for us
starting the company.

00:36:25.940 --> 00:36:27.890
What's happened now is we've grown.

00:36:27.890 --> 00:36:32.350
As the utility industry has started to evolve
in this direction, as utilities are realizing

00:36:32.350 --> 00:36:38.550
that their future is much more consumer centric
than it ever has been, or certainly for the

00:36:38.550 --> 00:36:40.270
last 85 years.

00:36:40.270 --> 00:36:43.590
Many of them may be, more than they wish it
were.

00:36:43.590 --> 00:36:47.970
But as this political spotlight has been shined
on the utility industry, it's not easy to

00:36:47.970 --> 00:36:50.430
go build a dirty coal plant anymore.

00:36:50.430 --> 00:36:58.050
So to hit capacity requirements, to handle
new population growth, and to invest in new

00:36:58.050 --> 00:37:01.490
infrastructure, which is how utilities make
money, they're finding that all of their new

00:37:01.490 --> 00:37:05.160
investments inevitably are more consumer intertwined.

00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:08.270
Whether it's smart meters where we've all
heard about the crazy ruckus here about people

00:37:08.270 --> 00:37:13.142
being upset about them, or peak reduction
programs where they try to get you to install

00:37:13.142 --> 00:37:16.290
a thermostat that reduces your peak usage.

00:37:16.290 --> 00:37:19.530
There's a lot of interaction you have to have
with the consumer.

00:37:19.530 --> 00:37:23.840
So as utilities are moving in that direction,
they're realizing they need this consumer

00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:29.940
infrastructure to engage customers and to
be able to provide a better value.

00:37:29.940 --> 00:37:33.680
Also, as rates are rising, which is the other
thing that's happening, is people are not

00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:35.600
allowing coal plants to be built.

00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:39.840
So for all these reasons, it becomes politically
very important for the utility to have a much

00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:42.170
better capability to engage the consumer.

00:37:42.170 --> 00:37:45.530
That's how, as we've grown, how this has grown.

00:37:45.530 --> 00:37:49.900
It's still the core-- What we like to say
is an energy efficient customer is a happy

00:37:49.900 --> 00:37:54.020
customer 'cause we just want to save money
on our bills.

00:37:54.020 --> 00:37:55.990
That's a major factor.

00:37:55.990 --> 00:37:59.810
So the question is, we have this feedback
loop where we're sending signals once a month.

00:37:59.810 --> 00:38:02.620
Do we have the capability to send it faster.

00:38:02.620 --> 00:38:04.500
We definitely have the capability to send
it faster.

00:38:04.500 --> 00:38:09.700
Then the question is-- We're taking 6 minutes
a year of attention up to 12 minutes.

00:38:09.700 --> 00:38:12.430
Can we take it up to 400 minutes?

00:38:12.430 --> 00:38:16.220
I think at some point, the answer is no, people
don't actually want to think about their energy

00:38:16.220 --> 00:38:17.230
use that much.

00:38:17.230 --> 00:38:24.030
So where we're focused-- One of our mantras
for a long time has been insights in analytics

00:38:24.030 --> 00:38:25.460
trump real time.

00:38:25.460 --> 00:38:28.350
People actually don't want to get feedback
constantly.

00:38:28.350 --> 00:38:34.770
They want to get more and more, richer and
richer, more and more tailored feedback.

00:38:34.770 --> 00:38:37.810
I always come back to-- I was thinking about
what would my mom want to get?

00:38:37.810 --> 00:38:43.420
My mom would love to get a notice in the spring
that says, "Last summer was a doozy.

00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:46.400
You paid twice as much as your neighbors on
AC.

00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:52.490
Here's the top three things you should do
to save energy this summer on air conditioning."

00:38:52.490 --> 00:38:57.520
Rather than getting a weekly or daily email
about her energy use.

00:38:57.520 --> 00:39:04.680
That being said, one of the features we've
just rolled out is a weekly smart meter-enabled

00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:08.400
update on your usage for people who are engaged
at that level.

00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:10.220
We do emails as frequently as people want.

00:39:10.220 --> 00:39:12.010
We do alerts now.

00:39:12.010 --> 00:39:18.900
We're doing, for some of these utilities that
have load reduction days, we'll send out,

00:39:18.900 --> 00:39:25.710
for one utility, 2 million emails in 30 minutes
because we've got to get all of these people

00:39:25.710 --> 00:39:27.880
this information.

00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:31.970
So I'm hearing two different questions.

00:39:31.970 --> 00:39:34.140
Let's see if I can answer this.

00:39:34.140 --> 00:39:40.930
[pause] There's this long term challenge of,
okay, so if everybody installs the residential

00:39:40.930 --> 00:39:44.300
PV, there's no-- efficiency doesn't matter
anymore.

00:39:44.300 --> 00:39:48.810
I've two thoughts, I've number of thoughts
on that.

00:39:48.810 --> 00:39:50.320
One is, God, that'd be awesome.

00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:55.670
I'd be happy to go out of business if everybody
loaded up with a solar PV.

00:39:55.670 --> 00:39:59.220
But on top of that, that's going to be a long,
slow slog.

00:39:59.220 --> 00:40:02.950
We've been at it for, it's really in earnest
been going on for 5 years now.

00:40:02.950 --> 00:40:09.600
I think that they're just nearing 100,000
solar homes in the US, which is 1/1000 of

00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:10.990
the number of homes.

00:40:10.990 --> 00:40:13.170
So we've got a long way to go.

00:40:13.170 --> 00:40:18.510
Within that, I think there's a ton of opportunity
for us to help promote solar, to help report

00:40:18.510 --> 00:40:23.910
back on solar, to aggregate solar on lots
of different things that can be done, and

00:40:23.910 --> 00:40:28.310
to be involved in selling it, not just promoting
it.

00:40:28.310 --> 00:40:30.370
And financing, etcetera.

00:40:30.370 --> 00:40:36.740
That, to me, is a long term opportunity and
problem, and in the same timeframe as solar

00:40:36.740 --> 00:40:41.200
starts to happen, that's why we are getting
into the things like thermostats.

00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:46.021
And we'll be-- As electric vehicles become
more scaled, we'll be looking at what we can

00:40:46.021 --> 00:40:48.900
do there.

00:40:48.900 --> 00:40:53.090
The other question was about what if behavior
dries up.

00:40:53.090 --> 00:40:59.790
That one is-- I've got at least 100,000 years
of evolutionary history to say that we're

00:40:59.790 --> 00:41:02.440
going to stick with the pack for the next
100 years.

00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:04.410
That one I'm not too worried about.

00:41:04.410 --> 00:41:10.210
[laughs] If you're a City of Palo Alto resident,
you should be getting our home energy reports

00:41:10.210 --> 00:41:12.720
which were sent out in the mail or email.

00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:14.360
Who is a City of Palo Alto resident here?

00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:15.360
&gt;&gt;Male #3: Yeah.

00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:17.110
&gt;&gt;Dan Yates: Are you getting it?

00:41:17.110 --> 00:41:18.970
What's your neighbor rank?

00:41:18.970 --> 00:41:23.160
[laughter] What's your neighbor rank?

00:41:23.160 --> 00:41:25.380
Do you know what your neighbor rank is?

00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:26.380
&gt;&gt;Male #3: No.

00:41:26.380 --> 00:41:27.420
&gt;&gt;Dan Yates: Oh, okay.

00:41:27.420 --> 00:41:32.130
I ask 'cause most people tend to know it,
and I always like to highlight it because

00:41:32.130 --> 00:41:36.260
the fact that people could remember it is
indicative of the amount of attention it captures.

00:41:36.260 --> 00:41:40.700
But unfortunately, this didn't play out so
well with this group.

00:41:40.700 --> 00:41:44.150
[laughter]
In Palo Alto, we're just sending out the reports.

00:41:44.150 --> 00:41:48.200
We haven't started to do any of the web offerings,
and Palo Alto doesn't have smart meters.

00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:52.290
At PG&amp;E, we're sending reports to a lot of
customers, but probably many of you aren't

00:41:52.290 --> 00:41:57.810
getting them because we started with them
targeting the largest homes.

00:41:57.810 --> 00:42:04.180
We have something like 300,000 homes, I think,
of the 5 million getting reports.

00:42:04.180 --> 00:42:09.170
The biggest thing we're doing at PG&amp;E today
is we're powering most of the website.

00:42:09.170 --> 00:42:16.460
So when you log into My Energy, the 2 tabs
that are about ways to save and I forget--

00:42:16.460 --> 00:42:19.070
the other one was called "my energy use."

00:42:19.070 --> 00:42:21.920
Those tabs are entirely powered by us.

00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:26.600
And then we also have all of the-- If you
look at changing rates at PG&amp;E, the tool that

00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:30.030
helps you analyze that is an Opower tool.

00:42:30.030 --> 00:42:34.830
Now I was just talking to Kevin, I don't know
his last name.

00:42:34.830 --> 00:42:36.260
&gt;&gt;Male #4: Chen.

00:42:36.260 --> 00:42:43.190
&gt;&gt;Dan Yates: Chen, in the sustainability group
about his experience with this rate-switching

00:42:43.190 --> 00:42:44.190
tool.

00:42:44.190 --> 00:42:47.930
He wanted-- on behalf of him I'll let you
know: when you get to the end, it makes you

00:42:47.930 --> 00:42:52.430
call PG&amp;E and then you have to spend half
an hour dealing with their phone tree to finally

00:42:52.430 --> 00:42:54.190
get to the point where you can switch your
rates.

00:42:54.190 --> 00:42:55.390
That's not our fault.

00:42:55.390 --> 00:43:00.790
They were unable to-- They had no APIs to
send rate switch signals to any piece of their

00:43:00.790 --> 00:43:06.260
infrastructure, so we have to, basically,
put a little thing that says, "Call PG&amp;E and

00:43:06.260 --> 00:43:09.770
read them this."

00:43:09.770 --> 00:43:14.490
Implementations are imperfect with these utilities,
but it's been exciting what we're-- PG&amp;E's

00:43:14.490 --> 00:43:16.170
actually been a great customer.

00:43:16.170 --> 00:43:18.300
They also have signed onto the social apps.

00:43:18.300 --> 00:43:23.530
So if you go to social dot opower dot com,
you can utility connect with both PG&amp;E and

00:43:23.530 --> 00:43:27.760
City of Palo Alto and you can compare with
your friends.

00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:29.710
We're continuing to invest a lot in that application.

00:43:29.710 --> 00:43:31.760
We just launched it and there's a lot more
to do.

00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:32.760
&gt;&gt; Female #3:

00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:37.030
&gt;&gt;Dan Yates: Yeah, so we-- The question is:
how have we tackled commercial building?

00:43:37.030 --> 00:43:41.410
There's 2 areas in commercial building that
we're probably not going to tackle.

00:43:41.410 --> 00:43:46.450
One is where there's a master meter building,
where there isn't individually metering because

00:43:46.450 --> 00:43:53.680
we just don't have-- we're all about the meter
data, and at least now, we're not in the business

00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:55.010
of metering.

00:43:55.010 --> 00:43:57.530
So we wait for people to do their own metering.

00:43:57.530 --> 00:44:02.770
And a lot of places in older buildings that
are not individually metered, it's not just--

00:44:02.770 --> 00:44:09.190
the electric circuits actually don't enable
individual metering, so it's not trivial.

00:44:09.190 --> 00:44:15.580
The other place is really big buildings and
big commercial enterprises.

00:44:15.580 --> 00:44:18.220
We're probably not-- It's going to be a long
time before we get there.

00:44:18.220 --> 00:44:21.430
And the reason there is that it's just a different
problem set.

00:44:21.430 --> 00:44:25.550
If you can afford-- If you have a full-time
energy manager like Walmart does, and they

00:44:25.550 --> 00:44:30.170
have a whole team of them, and you can afford
to have people come on site and do audits,

00:44:30.170 --> 00:44:39.590
our expertise in behavioral psychology and
direct marketing is out-gunned by door knockers.

00:44:39.590 --> 00:44:44.990
Where we are expanding is into small, medium
businesses which in many ways is like a stratified

00:44:44.990 --> 00:44:51.580
prosumer or heavy, large consumer.

00:44:51.580 --> 00:44:55.520
There we are, we've already done some stuff
and we're looking to do more.

00:44:55.520 --> 00:45:01.340
&gt;&gt;Male #5: I've a question about the size
of the opportunity ahead of you.

00:45:01.340 --> 00:45:07.270
You made a comparison to the solar industry,
so obviously you're doing huge work in energy

00:45:07.270 --> 00:45:08.440
reduction.

00:45:08.440 --> 00:45:11.780
But solar's really low on its exponential
curve.

00:45:11.780 --> 00:45:16.490
You cited some numbers for how many installations
there are residentially.

00:45:16.490 --> 00:45:22.950
But you-- So I heard a couple numbers from
you, which is that you have half of all US

00:45:22.950 --> 00:45:25.860
energy usage under management.

00:45:25.860 --> 00:45:29.920
If that's the case, and you're asymptotically
approaching 2-3%--

00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:32.800
&gt;&gt;Then I can only double and then I'm done.

00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:33.800
Yeah, let me answer that.

00:45:33.800 --> 00:45:34.800
Yeah.

00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:35.800
So we have-- That's great.

00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:40.020
This is a very smart audience.

00:45:40.020 --> 00:45:45.470
All of my little stats are being finally picked
apart in the right way, which is good.

00:45:45.470 --> 00:45:51.680
So we manage half of the US energy data right
now on behalf of these utilities, which is

00:45:51.680 --> 00:45:52.680
a great capability.

00:45:52.680 --> 00:45:57.650
It's a great position to be in so that we
can do things like launch an API platform

00:45:57.650 --> 00:46:02.460
or launch APIs on our platform, or we can--
For example, with social, when we turned it

00:46:02.460 --> 00:46:06.120
on for a new utility, we didn't have to get
any more data from them.

00:46:06.120 --> 00:46:07.170
We already had it.

00:46:07.170 --> 00:46:14.330
But we are only monetizing probably 10% of
that data that we have under management.

00:46:14.330 --> 00:46:21.550
So a good example is when we sold Com Edison
in the Illinois region and Chicago land area.

00:46:21.550 --> 00:46:26.020
We had a 50,000 home program with them, and
they gave us all 3 million homes worth of

00:46:26.020 --> 00:46:28.350
data.

00:46:28.350 --> 00:46:32.200
That's the case all over the place.

00:46:32.200 --> 00:46:36.800
To talk about our business, our TAM is in
the multiple billions of dollars, between

00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:40.730
3 and 5 billion.

00:46:40.730 --> 00:46:44.360
We're nowhere near that right now in terms
of our growth.

00:46:44.360 --> 00:46:50.950
As we serve-- There's a lot of great stuff
ahead of us.

00:46:50.950 --> 00:46:55.380
so our big expansion areas are domestically
in the US we still have new utilities to sell,

00:46:55.380 --> 00:46:58.080
and we have a lot of expansion with our existing
utilities.

00:46:58.080 --> 00:47:02.370
And then we're just now starting to really
expand internationally.

00:47:02.370 --> 00:47:04.710
That opportunity is as big as the US opportunity.

00:47:04.710 --> 00:47:07.000
And that's just market expansion.

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:12.170
Then we continue to build new products, like
this thermostat which I'm excited about.

00:47:12.170 --> 00:47:16.180
It's going to be a total new product line.

00:47:16.180 --> 00:47:17.180
It's actually interesting.

00:47:17.180 --> 00:47:20.340
We haven't actually looked that much at the
interfaces much on cars . We did-- I was at

00:47:20.340 --> 00:47:27.150
an event last spring, and I actually talked
to a business development guy from GM who

00:47:27.150 --> 00:47:30.390
said, "Hey, you should come talk to us, 'cause
we're designing some new cars and we want

00:47:30.390 --> 00:47:31.780
to talk to you about the interface."

00:47:31.780 --> 00:47:35.140
And we just didn't make it high enough up
on the priority list.

00:47:35.140 --> 00:47:38.050
We didn't feel like it was believable.

00:47:38.050 --> 00:47:42.400
It's going to be small scale, and they don't
have an electric car yet, or they almost do

00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:45.800
but not quite.

00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:47.200
So that is an interesting opportunity.

00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:49.530
I think we haven't looked into that that much.

00:47:49.530 --> 00:47:56.250
The area where we've thought a little bit
more is charging management, because that's

00:47:56.250 --> 00:48:01.040
where the utilities-- The utilities are thrilled
that there's going to be these new power consumers

00:48:01.040 --> 00:48:04.120
on their grid using up more energy, and they
can make money off of them.

00:48:04.120 --> 00:48:07.680
But what they're confused about is: how's
this going to work?

00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:13.430
Because an electric vehicle in charging mode
is like a house, so it's like you're driving

00:48:13.430 --> 00:48:15.690
houses around and jamming them into the grid.

00:48:15.690 --> 00:48:17.520
All of a sudden, the transformer melts.

00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:23.060
That's very, very expensive compared to the
value of the electricity from the car.

00:48:23.060 --> 00:48:27.850
So they're trying to get a handle on how they
manage that.

00:48:27.850 --> 00:48:33.710
There are lots of companies that are astutely
going after this in a way that we haven't

00:48:33.710 --> 00:48:36.900
yet, but it's an area that we're monitoring.

00:48:36.900 --> 00:48:38.460
&gt;&gt; Male #6: Inaudible

00:48:38.460 --> 00:48:44.100
&gt;&gt;Yeah, so there's a lot of different-- people
taking a lot of different tacks.

00:48:44.100 --> 00:48:48.540
One is the charging station that works like
Zipcar for charging.

00:48:48.540 --> 00:48:49.910
Well, not really, but whatever.

00:48:49.910 --> 00:48:50.910
You get it.

00:48:50.910 --> 00:48:55.280
And another way is, Better Place has tried
to do it, where you have replaceable batteries

00:48:55.280 --> 00:49:00.230
and there's essentially gas stations for batteries.

00:49:00.230 --> 00:49:04.130
And then there's the third way, which is that
people just don't have either and you just

00:49:04.130 --> 00:49:11.450
charge your car at home and maybe cut a deal
at your office to charge your car there.

00:49:11.450 --> 00:49:19.010
I think it's to be seen how much these other--
I think this is all early days.

00:49:19.010 --> 00:49:21.100
It's to be seen what's going to stick or not.

00:49:21.100 --> 00:49:22.930
&gt;&gt;Male #7: Is it that bad?

00:49:22.930 --> 00:49:26.340
&gt;&gt;No, I think it's actually not that complicated.

00:49:26.340 --> 00:49:33.100
There are a lot of decoy facts out there that
are hard to parse out, like the tiered pricing,

00:49:33.100 --> 00:49:38.380
which is a mandated structure from-- This
is a California phenomenon.

00:49:38.380 --> 00:49:44.920
It's manned by the utility commission as a
way to try to, essentially, charge rich people

00:49:44.920 --> 00:49:48.770
more for electricity and discourage overconsumption.

00:49:48.770 --> 00:49:52.650
But that's not a fact of the energy market.

00:49:52.650 --> 00:49:55.560
It's a policy manipulation.

00:49:55.560 --> 00:50:01.890
The core dynamic is-- Just think about cell
phone companies.

00:50:01.890 --> 00:50:04.100
They have a network they put a lot of money
into.

00:50:04.100 --> 00:50:06.180
They want you to use it.

00:50:06.180 --> 00:50:13.240
But they max out at peak times, and then they
have these trough times where there's no usage.

00:50:13.240 --> 00:50:20.050
Just like cell phone networks, they have all
these-- they can't shut down the base stations

00:50:20.050 --> 00:50:21.460
at night.

00:50:21.460 --> 00:50:26.610
Even if they did, it doesn't matter because
the base station is you build as many of them

00:50:26.610 --> 00:50:30.910
out to meet peak demand, not because of--
and so it's just wasted at night.

00:50:30.910 --> 00:50:35.170
The cell phone companies would be happy to
pay you, probably, to use their network.

00:50:35.170 --> 00:50:36.570
It means nothing to them at night time.

00:50:36.570 --> 00:50:39.300
It's why they have nights and weekend plans.

00:50:39.300 --> 00:50:47.580
So it's the exact same thing with utilities
and with the peak usage and the off-time usage.

00:50:47.580 --> 00:50:53.850
And with coal plants, the problem is, and
with all these baseload plants, is they literally

00:50:53.850 --> 00:50:58.490
take 24 hours to power up, so they can't shut
them off at night.

00:50:58.490 --> 00:51:03.360
So that is not just a waste of capital in
the infrastructure, but it's actually a huge

00:51:03.360 --> 00:51:06.720
waste of emissions and fuel.

00:51:06.720 --> 00:51:09.400
So the utilities are motivated to reduce peak.

00:51:09.400 --> 00:51:11.990
They have an endemic interest in doing that.

00:51:11.990 --> 00:51:19.090
Then the commissions, which are-- you should
think of them as your proxy-- are motivated

00:51:19.090 --> 00:51:23.320
in reducing overall usage because they want
to save people money and help the environment.

00:51:23.320 --> 00:51:27.890
So the commissions will set these efficiency
standards, and the utilities go out and try

00:51:27.890 --> 00:51:30.440
to come up with ways to shave peak.

00:51:30.440 --> 00:51:35.730
Those are basically the two major dynamics.

00:51:35.730 --> 00:51:37.910
In the top hours, it's a loss.

00:51:37.910 --> 00:51:41.290
In the worst hours of the year, it can be
a loss, depending on the utility.

00:51:41.290 --> 00:51:46.080
If the utility has their own generation or
they're buying on the open market.

00:51:46.080 --> 00:51:47.080
Yeah.

00:51:47.080 --> 00:51:55.130
When the utility exec wakes up in the morning,
he does not want, or she does not want, to

00:51:55.130 --> 00:51:57.130
deliver energy efficiency.

00:51:57.130 --> 00:51:58.180
They may be interested.

00:51:58.180 --> 00:52:01.410
They are in many cases interested in reducing
peak.

00:52:01.410 --> 00:52:05.830
And then the commission wakes up in the morning
and says, "I want to save citizens of California

00:52:05.830 --> 00:52:07.870
energy and money and help the environment."

00:52:07.870 --> 00:52:12.920
And that's the group who says, "Let's have
an efficiency standard."

00:52:12.920 --> 00:52:17.090
And then the utility says, "Well, if they
want it, I got to endear myself to them because

00:52:17.090 --> 00:52:19.960
they're my buyer, when I go to try to sell
this next thing.

00:52:19.960 --> 00:52:23.300
So maybe I should take into consideration
this efficiency stuff."

00:52:23.300 --> 00:52:29.920
And then the complex political intertanglings
continue to unfold.

00:52:29.920 --> 00:52:32.310
But those are the two major fundamentals.

00:52:32.310 --> 00:52:34.280
All right.

00:52:34.280 --> 00:52:36.080
Thank you guys so much for so many great questions.

00:52:36.080 --> 00:52:36.290
