00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:00.850
In

00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.750
the last video, I claimed that
this result we got for the area

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:09.770
of a triangle that had sides
of length a, b, and c is

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:11.810
equivalent to Heron's formula.

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:14.150
And what I want to do in this
video is show you that this is

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:16.780
equivalent to Heron's formula
by essentially just doing a

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:18.990
bunch of algebraic
manipulation.

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.590
So the first thing we want to
do-- let's just spring this

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:23.590
1/2 c under the radical sign.

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:28.170
So 1/2 c, that's the same
thing as the square root

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.480
of c squared over 4.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.910
You take the square root
of that you get 1/2 c.

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.270
So this whole expression is
equal to-- instead of drawing

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.450
the radical, I'll just write
the square root of this,

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:48.200
of c squared over 4
times all of this.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.530
I'll just copy and paste it.

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.610
Copy and paste.

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.160
So times all of that.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.160
And of course, it has
to be distributed.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.960
So c squared over 4
times all of that.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.390
And then we have to
close the square root.

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.460
Let me just distribute
the c squared over 4.

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.960
This is going to be equal
to the square root.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.940
This is going to be hairy,
but I think you'll find it

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.620
satisfying to see how this
could turn into something as

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.470
simple as Heron's formula.

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:24.660
The square root of c squared
over 4 times a squared is c

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:32.560
squared a squared over 4,
minus c squared over 4.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.270
I'm just distributing this.

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.600
And I'm going to write it as
the numerator squared over

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.060
the denominator squared.

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.090
So times c squared plus
a squared minus b

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:45.950
squared, squared.

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.815
Over-- if I square the
denominator that's 4c squared.

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.840
And we immediately see that c
squared and that c squared

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:55.600
are going to cancel out.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.260
Let me close all of the
parentheses just like that.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.530
And, of course, this 4 times
that 4, that's going to

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.520
result in-- well let
me write it this way.

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.490
That's the same
thing as 4 squared.

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.850
And I'm instead of writing
16, you'll see why

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:09.890
I'm writing that.

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:11.880
Now this I can rewrite.

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.340
This is going to be equal to
the square root-- I'm

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.460
arbitrarily switching colors--
of ca over 2 squared.

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:25.780
This is the same thing as that.

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.990
Right?

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.150
I'm just writing it as
the whole thing squared.

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.360
If I square that, that's the c
squared a squared over 2

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.930
squared over 4, minus-- and I'm
going to write this whole thing

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.520
as an expression squared.

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.800
So that's c squared
plus a squared minus

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.360
b squared, over 4.

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.810
And we are squaring both the
numerator and the denominator.

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.740
Now this might look a little
bit interesting to you.

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:56.120
Let me make the parentheses in
a slightly different color.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.775
You might remember from
factoring polynomials that if I

00:03:00.775 --> 00:03:03.460
have something of the form x
squared minus y squared, that

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:08.520
factors into x plus
y times x minus y.

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.000
And we're going to be using
this over and over again.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.590
Now if you call ca over 2x, and
you call this whole big thing

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.110
y, then we have x squared
minus y squared.

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:20.390
So we can factor it.

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:27.966
So this whole thing is going to
be equal to the square root of

00:03:27.966 --> 00:03:34.740
x plus y, or in this case it's
ca over 2 plus the y, which is

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:40.960
c squared plus a squared
minus b squared over 4.

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.020
Times x minus y.

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:45.570
So this is our x.

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:51.370
ca over 2, minus all of
this business over here.

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.840
Or even better, let me just
say plus and then let me

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:54.680
just write the negative.

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:01.980
So plus minus c squared minus
a squared plus b squared.

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:05.140
All of that over 4.

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:10.180
So all I did here is I said
this is the same thing as this

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:15.120
plus this, this plus this,
times this minus this, this

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.610
minus-- I just said plus
the negative of this.

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:21.770
So minus c squared minus a
squared plus b squared.

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:24.470
All I did is that right there.

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:26.610
Now let's see if we can
simplify this, or if we

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.870
could add these fractions.

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:30.680
Well, we can get a
common denominator.

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:35.650
ca over 2, that's the same
thing as 2ca over 4.

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.910
ca over 2, that's the same
thing as 2ca over 4, just

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.160
multiplying the numerator
and the denominator by 2.

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.420
And now we can add
the numerators.

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:49.540
So our whole expression is now
going to be equal to the square

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:55.645
root of this first expression,
will become-- and I'm going

00:04:55.645 --> 00:04:56.460
to write it this way.

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:07.820
I'm going to write c squared
plus 2ca plus a squared minus b

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:11.820
squared, all of that over 4.

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:13.900
That's our first expression.

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:18.010
And then our second expression
is going to become-- well,

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:20.190
everything's going to be over
4, so I'll just write

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:21.070
that right now.

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:21.965
Everything over 4.

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:36.030
And then we could write this
as b squared, minus c squared

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:43.490
minus 2ca plus a squared.

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:46.570
Just to make sure, I have
a minus a squared here.

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:49.320
Plus times a minus, still
it's a minus a squared.

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:51.420
I have a plus 2ca over here.

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:54.080
Minus times a minus,
that's a plus 2ca.

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:55.580
I have a minus c squared here.

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:57.170
I have a minus c squared here.

00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:00.530
So these two things
are equivalent.

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:04.630
Now the next thing we need to
recognize, or hopefully we can

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:09.940
recognize, is that this over
here-- this might get a little

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:13.690
bit messy-- that's the same
thing as c plus a squared.

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:14.350
Let me write this.

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:20.860
This is equal to the square
root, open parentheses, of this

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:29.940
over here is c plus a squared
minus b squared, over 4.

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:31.480
That's that first term.

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:33.020
And then the second term.

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:35.920
This over here is the same
thing as c minus a squared.

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:39.120
So that whole thing will
simplify to b squared

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:47.470
minus c minus a squared,
all of that over 4.

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:48.910
So we're making some headway.

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:51.830
As I told you, this
is a hairy problem.

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:53.950
But we're seeing some neat
applications of factoring

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:57.320
polynomials, and we're seeing
how a fairly bizarre looking

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:00.160
equation can be transformed
into a simpler one.

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:02.090
Now we can use this exact same
property-- we have that

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:04.770
pattern-- something squared
minus something else squared.

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:08.500
So we can factor it out.

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:09.580
And I'll do it in
the same line.

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:12.120
So this is going to be equal
to-- I'm going to write a

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:14.040
little bit small, just so I
don't run out of space--

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:15.310
the square root.

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:20.000
This will factor into
this plus this.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:29.510
So c plus a plus b times
c plus a minus b.

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:29.850
Right?

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:32.030
It's the exact same pattern
that I did over here.

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:34.470
This is x squared,
this is y squared.

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:41.760
So times c plus a minus
b, all of that over 4.

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:43.260
And then we have this one.

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:46.250
This is going to be
b plus c minus a.

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:53.180
Let me scroll down to
the right a little bit.

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:59.030
Times b plus c minus a--
that's x plus y-- times

00:07:59.030 --> 00:08:02.640
b minus c minus a.

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:09.020
Or that's the same thing
as b minus c plus a.

00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:13.110
This is the same thing
as b minus c minus a.

00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:14.140
Right?

00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:14.570
All right.

00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:20.370
And all of that over 4.

00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:23.910
Now, I can rewrite this
whole expression.

00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:25.580
I don't want to
run out of space.

00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:30.305
I can rewrite this whole
expression as, well 4 is

00:08:30.305 --> 00:08:32.955
the product of 2 times 2.

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:40.620
So our whole area expression
has been, arguably, simplified

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:44.780
to it equals the square root--
and this is really the home

00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:50.560
stretch-- of this right here,
which I can just write as

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:55.780
a plus b plus c over 2.

00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:57.690
That's that term right there.

00:08:57.690 --> 00:09:00.640
Times this term.

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:02.480
Times that term.

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:05.340
And let me write a
simplification here. c plus a

00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:13.200
minus b, that's the same thing
as a plus b plus c minus 2b.

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:14.490
These two things
are equivalent.

00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:14.700
Right?

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:19.450
You have an a, you have a c,
and then b minus 2b is going

00:09:19.450 --> 00:09:22.510
to be equal to minus b.

00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:24.750
Right? b minus 2b,
that's minus b.

00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:29.690
So this next term is going
to be a plus b plus

00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:34.330
c minus 2b, over 2.

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:36.240
Or instead of writing it like
that, let me write this

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:40.570
over 2 minus this over 2.

00:09:40.570 --> 00:09:43.920
And then our next
term right here.

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:46.180
Same exact logic.

00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:55.360
That's the same thing as a
plus b plus c minus 2a,

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:56.500
all of that over 2.

00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:56.770
Right?

00:09:56.770 --> 00:09:59.960
If we add the minus 2a to
the a we get minus a.

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:02.040
So we get b plus c minus a.

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:03.820
These are identical things.

00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:06.950
So all this over 2, or we
can split the denominators

00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:09.130
just like that over 2.

00:10:09.130 --> 00:10:10.680
And then one last term.

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:13.690
And you might already
recognize the rule of

00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:16.500
Heron's formula popping up.

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:19.570
I was thinking not the rule
of Heron-- Heron's formula.

00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:23.050
That term right there is
the exact same thing as a

00:10:23.050 --> 00:10:27.570
plus b plus c minus 2c.

00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:27.860
Right?

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:31.200
You take 2c away from the c you
get a minus c, and then you

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:32.650
still have the a and the b.

00:10:32.650 --> 00:10:34.540
And then all of that over 2.

00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:37.640
You could write that over
2 minus that over 2.

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:39.600
And, of course, we're
taking the square root

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:41.540
of all of this stuff.

00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:52.230
Now, if we define an S to be
equal to a plus b plus c over

00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:55.560
2, then this equation
simplifies a good bit.

00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:57.800
This right here is S.

00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:00.130
That right there is S.

00:11:00.130 --> 00:11:01.705
That right there is S.

00:11:01.705 --> 00:11:03.940
And that right there is S.

00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:07.720
And these simplify
a good bit too.

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:12.030
Minus 2b over 2, that's just
the same thing as minus b.

00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:14.880
Minus 2a over 2, that's the
same thing as minus a.

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:17.100
Minus 2c over 2, that's the
same thing as minus c.

00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:23.590
So this whole equation for our
area now is equal to-- I'll

00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:24.620
rewrite the square root.

00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:30.670
The radical, the square root,
of S-- that's that right there.

00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:34.500
I'll do it in the same colors.

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:46.890
Times S minus b, times this is
S minus a, times-- and we're

00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:49.555
at the last one-- S minus c.

00:11:52.390 --> 00:11:56.510
And we have proved Heron's
formula is the exact same thing

00:11:56.510 --> 00:11:59.410
as what we proved at the
end of the last video.

00:11:59.410 --> 00:12:02.250
So this was pretty neat.

00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:05.910
And we just had to do a
little bit of hairy algebra

00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:08.150
to actually prove it.
