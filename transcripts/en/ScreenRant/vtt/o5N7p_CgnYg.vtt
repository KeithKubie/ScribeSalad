While watching a Disney movie, viewers may
wonder why some animated characters seem so

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.300
familiar. Animation teams will often look
to real-life famous faces to assist in etching

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:17.890
an unforgettable character. Here are 10 Disney
Characters Inspired by Real-Life People You’d

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.430
Aladdin
1992’s Aladdin included two actors who inspired

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:33.300
characters in the film. Robin Williams is
one of the actors and the most obvious one.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.260
The animators were inspired by the comedian’s
mannerisms, facial features and, boisterous

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:44.780
attitude to create the Genie. Since Williams
voiced the character, it is not nearly as

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:52.240
surprising as who inspired the appearance
of Aladdin. Initially animators envisioned

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:57.030
Michael J. Fox but realized he just didn’t
have the same sex appeal. It was then Tom

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.100
Cruise who the animators used to base their
titular character, Cruise being the biggest

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.329
movie star at the time may have been the reason
Disney wanted to use his likeness for their

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:09.560
film. Along with his facial features, Aladdin
also began taking on certain characteristics

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:16.749
of Cruise and the characters for which he
was known, giving Aladdin just enough cockiness

00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:20.210
and charm to win over children and adults
alike.

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.719
Ariel, The Little Mermaid
Actress, writer, and producer Sherri Stoner

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:28.560
was used as a reference for the animators
when drawing Ariel from The Little Mermaid.

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.599
Stoner previously worked with Disney as a
screenwriter for their animated shows including

00:01:32.599 --> 00:01:37.069
Chip and Dale, Rescue Rangers. Filmmakers
used her body movements and mannerisms to

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:42.159
visualize realistic flow for Ariel but animators
used another actress to base Ariel’s face

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:47.499
on, Alyssa Milano. As a child and teen actress
on the 1980’s sitcom Who’s the Boss? Milano’s

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:51.880
teen dream persona and stunning face was the
ideal choice to create a Disney worthy princess.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.749
Milano had no idea she was the inspiration
while the film was being made but was told

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:59.159
when she hosted a special for the film on
the Disney Channel upon the film’s release

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.279
in 1989.

00:02:00.279 --> 00:02:07.139
Ursula, The Little Mermaid
Ariel is not the only character to be based

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:11.630
on a famous performer. Ursula, the evil sea-witch
who makes young Ariel an offer she can’t

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:17.040
refuse was modeled after Divine. The late
actor, singer and drag queen was such a vibrant

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:25.050
character, Disney animators looked to the
performer to create the wicked villain. Divine,

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.569
whose real name was Harris Glenn Milstead
exploded onto the movie scene in in the 1970s

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:33.540
with John Waters’ film Pink Flamingos and
continued working with the director until

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.739
1988 with Hairspray. Ursula has such a resemblance
to the late Divine, it is almost surprising

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:42.440
that the family friendly company would choose
to model a character after the star of Pink

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.939
Flamingos. Unfortunately, Divine never saw
the final product, dying one year before the

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:53.709
film’s release.

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:59.540
Edna Mode, The Incredibles.
The diminutive stylist of the superhero family,

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:05.989
The Incredibles, Edna Mode is a hilarious
and wacky character, but while viewers may

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:09.999
assume she sprouted from the vivid imagination
of Pixar animators, she is actually based

00:03:09.999 --> 00:03:14.489
on real-life stylist Edith Head. The legendary
costume designer who won eight Academy Awards

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:20.060
for films including All About Eve, Roman Holiday,
and The Sting. Head had an equally small stature

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:25.129
as her animated facsimile, standing at just
over five feet. Just as Edna sported memorable

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:29.500
coke-bottle glasses, Head originated the look.
While those who were familiar with Edith Head

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.359
may have easily guessed Edna Mode was an obvious
reference to Head, others may have assumed

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:38.910
Edna was just another comical Pixar creation.

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:46.459
Chernabog, Fantasia
To create the demon Chernabog for 1940’s

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:50.980
Fantasia, animators wanted to use an equally
menacing presence to provide inspiration for

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.010
a character who would terrify children for
generations. To create a truly frightening

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:59.090
demon, Disney looked no further than Bela
Lugosi, the actor known for his depiction

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:04.329
of Bram Stoker’s Dracula in the 1931 film,
Dracula. While Lugosi’s blood sucking villain,

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:07.730
for which he is best known, may have been
chilling, not all of the animators were completely

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:12.490
set on Lugosi. After the actor completed his
modeling session for Chernabog, the animators

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:16.730
went a step further and requested fellow animator
Wilfred Jackson to model shirtless and act

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:20.980
some of the demon’s scenes. In the end,
the character was inspired by two performers,

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:30.229
which may not have satisfied Lugosi’s much
speculated ego.

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:35.380
The Evil Queen, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs
If the devastatingly impressive eyebrows of

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:39.290
the Evil Queen from Snow White and the Seven
Dwarfs may seem familiar in another iconic

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:43.940
non-animated person, it is because animators
used actress Joan Crawford as a template for

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:48.770
Snow White’s hateful stepmother. Along with
her arched eyebrows, The Evil Queen also resembles

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:54.430
the legendary actress with deep-set dreamy
eyes, a strong jawline and intimidating personality.

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:58.199
Greta Garbo and Marlene Dietrich were two
more actresses who shared a resemblance to

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:02.389
Snow White’s nemesis, but most of what made
The Evil Queen stemmed from the unyielding

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:09.810
force of nature that was Joan Crawford.

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:14.620
Peter Pan
Peter Pan is the brainchild of novelist J.M.

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:18.560
Barrie. While his characteristics may have
already been decided long before Disney took

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:22.840
on the character, his mannerisms and appearance
were up to the animators to produce. Bobby

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:27.050
Driscoll was a child actor in the 1940’s
who has the impressive distinction of becoming

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:32.150
the first actor Walt Disney put under contract.
Along with starring in the now racially insensitive

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:37.330
film, Song of the South, he was also the bases
for Peter Pan’s appearance in the 1953 film.

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:42.139
Driscoll had a tough life like many child
actors, delving into heavy drug use. He died

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:47.960
of heart failure at the age of 31 in 1968.
While Driscoll’s life and death were a tragedy,

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:55.120
his place in the Disney legacy remains untouched
as the boy who never wanted to grow up.

00:05:55.120 --> 00:06:00.229
Cruella De Vil, 101 Dalmatians
Cruella De Vil is an enduring Disney villain,

00:06:00.229 --> 00:06:06.250
with her oversized fur coat, roaring cackle,
and penchant for puppy napping. The inspiration

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:10.979
for the cold-hearted Cruella was actress Tallulah
Bankhead. Tallulah was a stage actress but

00:06:10.979 --> 00:06:15.190
did work in film and television, with Alfred
Hitchcock’s Lifeboat being her most notable

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:20.300
credit. She was known for her outrageous temperament
and glamorous style. Along with her mannerisms,

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:24.889
filmmakers used the actress’s general personality,
though Bankhead was not an animal abuser,

00:06:24.889 --> 00:06:29.389
her detached demeanor was ideal for the villain.
Bankhead may have been the primary inspiration

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:33.360
for Cruella De Vil but she was not the actress
who provided the character’s voice, that

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:40.800
job went to Betty Lou Gerson who did her own
interpretation of Bankhead’s voice.

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:45.551
The Vultures, The Jungle Book
For the 1967’s The Jungle Book, filmmakers

00:06:45.551 --> 00:06:50.270
pulled from music icons to develop a jungle
of hip musician animals. While King Louie

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:54.960
is strongly inspired by Louis Armstrong, Disney
decided to go with Louis Prima to voice the

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:59.300
orangutan, partly to avoid any possible racism
issues that may arise from hiring an African

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:03.910
American man to play a primate. Another notable
inspiration in The Jungle Book is the vultures

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:08.520
who were heavily influenced by The Beatles.
The mop tops and Liverpool accents are more

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:12.930
than just a coincidence. The Beatles were
originally supposed to voice the four birds,

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:17.250
but with a busy fab-four schedule and John
Lennon deciding&nbsp;against it, it didn’t work

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:26.940
out. What remains is a similar musical quartet
of the vulture variety.

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:37.480
Belle, Beauty and the Beast
For 1991’s Beauty and the Beast, Screenwriter

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:41.520
Linda Woolverton based Belle’s personality
on Katharine Hepburn’s portrayal of Jo March

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:46.270
in the 1933 adaptation of Little Women. Hepburn’s
strong and intelligent representation of a

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:50.639
classic literary character was exactly what
Woolverton wanted to see in Belle. As for

00:07:50.639 --> 00:07:54.300
Belle’s appearance, the animators were inspired
by a handful of actresses including Jennie

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:58.750
Garth, Natalie Wood, Grace Kelly, and Elizabeth
Taylor, and even characters Dorothy Gale from

00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:02.659
The Wizard of Oz and Maria Von Trapp from
The Sound of Music. Belle’s voice actor,

00:08:02.659 --> 00:08:06.879
Paige O’ Hara found Belle to be too perfect
but animators continued to tweak the character

00:08:06.879 --> 00:08:11.290
and used Sherri Stoner as a live action reference,
the same performer who inspired the body movements

00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:15.349
of Ariel in The Little Mermaid. In the case
of Belle, a single actor or character was

00:08:15.349 --> 00:08:19.219
not enough to create an unforgettable Disney
princess.
