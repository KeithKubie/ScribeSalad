1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:05,640
The Joe Rogan experience. Oh, that's why
I made a tweet. Somebody posted before,

2
00:00:05,641 --> 00:00:08,640
like I'm just saying how Cory steady
dropping down the rankings when you got

3
00:00:08,641 --> 00:00:09,750
guys like diamond race,

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,740
he beat Volkow who is four and everybody
say he lost that fight but he's Volcom

5
00:00:13,741 --> 00:00:16,020
was six actually sound like that.
He lost that fight.

6
00:00:16,021 --> 00:00:18,720
But he jumped up there for like,
how does he want off decision?

7
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:20,520
Like oh it's cause you
lose or win on decision.

8
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:23,220
They don't move rankings up for decision.
Then he won off decision.

9
00:00:23,221 --> 00:00:26,250
He went up to number four and somebody
said, how did that even possible? I said,

10
00:00:26,251 --> 00:00:29,020
it's to the point now I can't worry
about fighting hoopers and charge the

11
00:00:29,021 --> 00:00:31,770
rankings and my opponent.
Cause if I worry about both of them,

12
00:00:31,771 --> 00:00:34,260
I'm not focused on something.
I was worried about the opponent.

13
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,350
I'm going to keep beating whoever they
put in front of me and eventually had to

14
00:00:37,351 --> 00:00:40,290
keep trying to put these guys at
the fight. John like off knockout.

15
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:43,200
So you said Andrea Smith.
He knocked out Rashad, uh,

16
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:45,420
shogun and then choked out Vulcan.

17
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:48,360
He went up there to UFC John
and he had an underground.

18
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,940
All the extra stuff is good
when you're knocking guys out.

19
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,820
And I think it's gonna be, same thing with
Santo. He known for knocking guys out,

20
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:58,800
but his losses, um, an 85 other than
branch, he also Eric Spicy on the ground.

21
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,240
John is good on the ground.

22
00:01:00,241 --> 00:01:02,010
John's going to take them down
as soon as you can run to me,

23
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,740
you hit him one shot, I'm gonna take you
down and you ain't gonna have no answer.

24
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:05,760
Right.
You know what I mean?

25
00:01:05,761 --> 00:01:09,530
If you don't have everything tested by
the time when it's time to go to the

26
00:01:09,531 --> 00:01:14,160
championship fight, if you gained, do on
striking is over. Tiago to me seems like,

27
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:16,290
I mean,
he's a very dangerous guy,

28
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:20,910
but almost like so aggressive that
he's almost like a kamikaze guy.

29
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:23,640
Like he's do or die,
like kill or be killed.

30
00:01:23,641 --> 00:01:27,570
He comes in just swinging and
throwing hammers and if he connects,

31
00:01:27,571 --> 00:01:31,320
it's dangerous. If you can act is bad
for everybody, but it might not connect,

32
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:35,280
you know? I mean, that's kind
of how he is. He's, he's a,

33
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:38,280
he's a a wild card.
That's the best way to put it.

34
00:01:38,281 --> 00:01:43,281
Like he could connect on John if John
fucks around and I don't think he will.

35
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:46,880
I think, I mean he hasn't ever before
except for the Gustafson fight.

36
00:01:46,881 --> 00:01:48,630
I don't think he was prepared
as much as he should have.

37
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,360
And we saw that in the second
fight where he just dominated him.

38
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:54,180
But I think that if he makes a mistake,

39
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,930
Tiago could shut the lights out
on anybody. That guy of swings,

40
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:00,150
he throws like it's less sledgehammer.

41
00:02:00,151 --> 00:02:03,810
Even rose is not trying to make it to
the final round. He's not pacing himself,

42
00:02:03,811 --> 00:02:06,750
does none of that. That
dude, he comes out hard.

43
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,050
But it's like I think
about him as my fight.

44
00:02:09,051 --> 00:02:12,670
We are literally Chiefy going into
that fight. We, I knew 100% now there.

45
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,420
He's going to try the rest of me.
If he can't take me now,

46
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:17,270
everything is going to be haymakers cause
he seen me get touched in the chin and

47
00:02:17,271 --> 00:02:21,290
go down a robble. So as long as I
keep moving, if I make him miss,

48
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:22,483
he's going to get tired.

49
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:25,460
And he's going to stop throwing those
big haymakers and sometimes when he's

50
00:02:25,461 --> 00:02:26,091
swinging,
he missed.

51
00:02:26,091 --> 00:02:29,340
He almost falls over and it gives you
like the counter or to take down. Yeah,

52
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,380
that's thing in our division.
There's so many people not right.

53
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:34,940
More like rock 'em sock 'em robots I
think cause they got their hands up and

54
00:02:34,941 --> 00:02:38,030
they blocking and it's like, oh he's not
hitting the but with four ounce gloves.

55
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:43,070
I guess I'll put like I was caged Safa
Ryan Bader in John Anthony Johnson Bader

56
00:02:43,071 --> 00:02:45,290
had his hands up but Rumba
was hit his hand so hard.

57
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:47,420
Also you see his hands just drop,
he was out.

58
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:52,220
It doesn't matter if you let them hit,
you get a chance to still getting wobbled.

59
00:02:52,221 --> 00:02:54,860
And I think with John,
John's good at evading punches.

60
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:58,850
Most guys stand our block and counter
back or try to take a punch and hit you

61
00:02:58,851 --> 00:03:01,660
back. Like take a punch to give a
punch. Yeah. It's not that kind of,

62
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:03,940
he's going to move,
move, move and you swing.

63
00:03:03,941 --> 00:03:07,270
He so long he can put his hands out
and keep your distance and hit you with

64
00:03:07,271 --> 00:03:11,560
those quick, fast, long kicks and
stuff and I just, like you said,

65
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:14,560
I don't see John Messing around.
He knows is dangerous. He's smart.

66
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:18,550
I will say John's not only
the best fighter if he's
pot and mentally as a mixed

67
00:03:18,551 --> 00:03:22,600
martial artist, he sees what's going
on really well. He knows how to adapt.

68
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:26,260
He can go out there and try tricky stuff
at times when he know I can try some

69
00:03:26,261 --> 00:03:28,210
stuff right here and get away
with it cause I'm home. Yeah.

70
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:31,000
I could show gun fight. He went out
there and showed up jumping knees,

71
00:03:31,001 --> 00:03:34,360
jumped with the kicks because Shogun
was so short. Yeah, he knew. He said,

72
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:37,900
I'm a different breed. I'm longer on
fast and tricky, but I think we'll come.

73
00:03:37,901 --> 00:03:39,610
A guy like Gus,
he didn't do all that stuff,

74
00:03:39,611 --> 00:03:43,210
but he knew he had to stay long in the
vape punches and kit to take down and hit

75
00:03:43,211 --> 00:03:46,580
him when you can. Yeah. The Gospel
fight. He showed his metal, right.

76
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:49,270
It showed that he could take it and
then winning the championship rounds,

77
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:51,850
even in a fight that he wasn't
really properly prepared for.

78
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:53,720
He showed that in the
Vito Belfort fight too,

79
00:03:53,721 --> 00:03:56,650
when he got caught up with that arm bar,
he overcomes adversity.

80
00:03:56,651 --> 00:04:00,340
He's not just a hammer. He knows how
to be the nail. He knows how to do it.
