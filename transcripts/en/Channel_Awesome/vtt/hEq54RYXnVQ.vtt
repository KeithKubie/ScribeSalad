00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.500
Ugh, this hurts.

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.360
"Hunchback of Notre Dame 2".

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.040
Of ALL the films that shouldn't have a sequel, this is one of them.

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:29.560
And of all the films that people were telling me to beware of the most when doing these sequels, it was Hunchback of Notre Dame II.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:37.980
The sad thing about it though is even though it is terrible, it's terrible for different reasons than I thought it was gonna be terrible.

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.540
I mean, don't get me wrong, the story is shit.

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:48.020
A circus comes into town and an evildoer wants to steal this super ritzy bell that just happens to be in Notre Dame.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:54.400
It looks like any ordinary bell, but on the inside it's gorgeous and beautiful and full of treasures.

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:55.860
Get it? GET IT?

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.800
One of the circus performers is named Madeline, played by Jennifer Love Hewitt.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.840
She's working with the evil villain, played by Michael McKean,

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:08.040
to be romantically interested with Quasimodo to lure him away from the bell so he can steal it.

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.720
Of course, a real life romance blooms between them, but, LIAR REVEALED.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.480
It's stolen before she can confess what's really going on.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:20.840
And of course she has a tragic backstory that doesn't really make sense,

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.220
She was a thief, and he's the only one that can look after her, yet -

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.420
really she could move anywhere and nobody would know about it, there's a million other ways around this.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.900
But if that seems too heavy and dramatic for you, it's okay!

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.900
Hayley Joel Osment plays the child of Phoebus and Esmerelda!

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.020
And this introduces us to one of the biggest problems of the movie -

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.540
taking mostly Academy Award-nominated actors and just having 'em say stupid shit.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.520
It's so hard seeing so many great actors just given a generic bullshit script to work with.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.240
And that really is the biggest problem; the script is awful.

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.240
From the initial setup, you know everything that's gonna happen.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.360
What every character is gonna do, when they're gonna do it, it's just ridiculous.

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:09.080
And why do we need an "appearances can be deceiving" story when the first one was already an "appearances can be deceiving" story?

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.800
But let's get to the toughest thing to talk about for me, and that's the animation.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:19.940
This was done by TMS, the people behind Akira, Batman: the Animated Series, Animaniacs,

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.960
Some of the greatest animation I've ever seen, top 5 of all time in my book.

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.860
But I'm not gonna lie, they just don't seem like the right choice here.

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.240
Not that they can't emulate the Disney style, I mean they look like the characters fine,

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.020
It's just that this looks more like a Disney Afternoon movie.

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:42.580
And what I mean by that is TMS doesn't traditionally use a lot of CGI, Disney does.

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.260
TMS doesn't usually use colored lines, Disney does.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:51.220
TMS's big strength is not in heartfelt emotion, but more aggressive emotion.

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.920
Akira is aggressive, Batman is aggressive.

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.060
Disney can be aggressive but it's known more for the sentimental side.

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.840
For example, when a character needs to be still TMS has them almost completely still.

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.140
Every once in a while, maybe a little movement.

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.080
With Disney, they're always somehow moving.

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:14.480
They have like a million in-betweeners, so when you're holding on a face it still looks like there's some movement there.

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.540
TMS doesn't function that way, it's supposed to be a little rougher.

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.920
So, the more tough emotional scenes they do fine,

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.560
When Quasimodo finally reveals himself, she steps back, she's afraid, she runs off.

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:27.960
That, they did great.

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:34.000
But scenes where it's supposed to feel whimsical, and magical, and lovey-dovey, that's just not their strong point.

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:37.800
I keep expecting to see Wakko Warner come out and bash someone with a mallet.

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.220
So, the animation is still good, it's just not good for this.

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:46.120
Which is a shame, because they do sometimes pick some very bad American projects.

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.040
So, is anything good?

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.220
Well, Michael McKean as the villain is actually not that bad.

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:58.060
I mean, the villain sucks, he really sucks, but the voice is legitimately kind of creepy and I never thought I'd get that out of Michael McKean.

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:59.340
The music's nice.

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.920
Oh, not the songs, they suck ass. These are some of the dumbest lyrics and most forgettable melodies.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:05.780
I'm talking about the instrumental score.

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:11.920
I mean sure, it's not the first Hunchback, but again,  direct to DVD, we get it, it's gonna be down a bit,

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.040
But for a direct to DVD musical score it's pretty good.

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.020
And what do you expect?I It's Carl Johnson, the guy who did Gargoyles, that's a great talent.

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:20.980
Outside of that, it's not much.

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:31.400
It's so hard to see so many great actors, so many wonderful animators, so many phenomenal talents thrown in to just the laziest, dumb ass script.

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:35.340
I don't even know how to fix it; what would you do with Hunchback of Notre Dame II?

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.040
It just seems like the first one ended perfectly.

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.620
I don't know, maybe there's a better writer out there that could make this work?

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:46.040
But for me, I'm wishing they gave this movie the Broadway-style ending.
