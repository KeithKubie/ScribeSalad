All of you detail-oriented people 
probably noticed that we never

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:07.190
actually used the coordinates we get
from the server for location,

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:11.460
relying instead on both the maps API, 
and the weather API to do the same thing

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.440
with location queries. 
Unfortunately,

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.680
they don't always agree. 
Implement maps using the coordinates

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.700
stored in the location table. 
You'll want to start

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.260
by moving the menu code 
from MainActivity to WeatherFragment.
