00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:19.430
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:22.370
The philosopher Eric
Davis refers to humans

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:27.830
as sparks that crackle
with being and intuition.

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:28.330
Right?

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:32.280
There is that sneaking suspicion
that there is more to us

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.240
than nature allows.

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.880
The human mind lives
in the liminal zone.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.820
It is not bound by time,
by space, and by distance.

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.240
There's is a natural
intuition to live

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.550
in these spaces of dream.

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.410
These spaces
between, so to speak.

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.860
We visit these zones when
we're asleep every night.

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:55.510
The dream is real
when you're in it,

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.320
Chris Nolan says in inception.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.110
Noam Chomsky talks about
psychic continuity, right?

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:04.790
When we watch a
piece of film that

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.060
is 24 still images per second,
and then you introduce editing,

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.700
and cutting, and cross-cutting
across time, across space, yet

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.020
psychic continuity links
the events together

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.190
and creates a
contiguous experience.

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.060
The human mind has no problem
orienting it's awareness

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.710
towards dimensions in which
time is no longer linear.

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.960
We enter these virtual
realities-- well really they're

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.150
real virtualities--
and we believe them.

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.780
We actively metabolize belief.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.870
We become immersed.

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:37.350
The mind unplugs from
the body and is not

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.060
bound in any capacity.

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.930
And that eventually
I think is where

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.370
we're going to go with
all of our virtual reality

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:45.030
technologies.

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.613
We're going to move
towards universals

00:01:46.613 --> 00:01:49.400
of our own construction,
as McKenna says.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.160
We're going to move into
spaces in which reality

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.060
is going to be a relative term.

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.490
Where people might suffer from
relativity sickness the way

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.451
that they suffer from ADD today.

00:02:01.451 --> 00:02:03.650
It's a wild idea.

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:05.340
I think that's
where we're heading.

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:24.125
