[APPLAUSE]

00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:02.375
GREG PROOPS: Thank you, brother.

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:06.350
Hi, you guys.

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:07.808
Thank you very much
for coming out.

00:00:07.808 --> 00:00:08.720
I'm sorry I'm late.

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:10.460
I know I cost you
billions of dollars

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:12.990
by being five minutes late
here and that the economy

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.130
of the world will turn on this.

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:16.720
It's exciting to
be here at Jewjel.

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.710
And we were at
AOL the other day,

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.059
and it's a ghost town over
there, I want to tell you that.

00:00:23.059 --> 00:00:24.100
It's exciting to be here.

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:25.500
I don't know who
you are, either.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.740
And that's the exciting part.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.370
I wrote a book because I have
a podcast called "The Smartest

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:32.290
Man in the World."

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:33.091
Yes, it's a joke.

00:00:33.091 --> 00:00:35.090
I don't think I'm the
smartest man in the world.

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:36.970
A friend of mine said to
me a couple years ago,

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:37.800
do you know how you come off?

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.633
And I said, no, I don't
know how I come off.

00:00:39.633 --> 00:00:41.640
And he said, like you
bloody know everything.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.830
So you should do a podcast
where you take questions

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.120
and brook no dissent.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.030
So that's how it got the
name and jazz like that.

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.710
Does anyone here ever
listen to the broadcast?

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:52.210
Two people.

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:52.834
That's awesome.

00:00:52.834 --> 00:00:54.820
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:56.610
But I'm sure you're
aware what podcasts

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.127
are because you work at Google.

00:00:58.127 --> 00:00:59.710
And you wouldn't
work at Google if you

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:01.090
didn't know what a podcast was.

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.430
Do people have their phones on
during these kind of things?

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.055
Or I assume you have your phones
on at all times because that's

00:01:06.055 --> 00:01:11.900
where all your friends are,
living in that imaginary world.

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.490
Unaccustomed as I am
to public speaking,

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:17.790
I feel awkward being here.

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.470
A very interesting
performing venue.

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:21.750
What do you usually have here?

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.020
Like drone fights or something?

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.350
It's the bizarre metal
bars that lead the way down

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.160
that make me feel like
something's going to break out

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:31.940
at any moment and
that there could

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.010
be some shit that goes down.

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:35.785
And I'm looking forward to that.

00:01:35.785 --> 00:01:37.910
I guess maybe I should read
something from the book

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:40.850
if I haven't convinced
you so far that I actually

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.140
am a comedian.

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.400
I don't know how loud this mic
is or if you can even hear me.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.110
My hearing's kind of faulty.

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.260
So I wrote the book.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.260
And it's about all the
things that we talk about

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:57.070
in the podcast, like feminism
and drugs, vodka-- Thank you.

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:58.070
You're allowed to laugh.

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.220
I'm supposed to be funny.

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:01.570
Please.

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:02.140
Please laugh.

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.790
This isn't a cookbook.

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:06.900
If I get less laughs
than Padma Lakshmi,

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.800
I'm going to kill myself.

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:17.040
And art, literature,
ancient history, baseball,

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.010
and music I like, records
I like, books I like.

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.959
Poetry, yes, there's
poetry in here.

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:23.500
I know that when
you work for Google,

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.830
sometimes poetry can seep
right out of your life.

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.067
And I'm here to imbue it
back into you in this book.

00:02:29.067 --> 00:02:30.650
We weren't able to
use all the poems I

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.730
wanted because they cost money.

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.734
But we put a lot
of poems in that

00:02:34.734 --> 00:02:37.990
are in the public domain that
are still quite beautiful

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:39.360
and jazz like that.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.860
We're going to do questions in
a minute, but let me read you

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:42.840
a couple things.

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.490
I asked for a
podium, but I didn't

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:48.130
realize I was going to be behind
Darth Vader's console here

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.850
and hiding back--
[BREATHING INTO THE MIC]

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:54.350
I wish you could
see this part here.

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:57.360
There's two monitors and
a bizarre goose-neck mic.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.652
And then some cables that make
no sense to me whatsoever.

00:03:02.652 --> 00:03:04.360
I wonder if I lick
the end of one of them

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.600
and stick it inside me, whether
the festivities will be more

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.490
festive when my hair lights up.

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:13.310
Let's see here.

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.101
I'll just read you
something from any-- oh,

00:03:15.101 --> 00:03:17.200
there's a lexicon-- a
Proops-tionary-- of words

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.020
that I wish would
disappear and other words

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.110
that I advise people to use.

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:23.210
For instance, let's start there.

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:25.324
In the Proops-tionary,
we've got--

00:03:25.324 --> 00:03:26.490
Words is all we gots, right?

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.420
Let's see.

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:36.220
I tend to speak in old-time
jive because I'm old-er.

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.531
And so I call people cats.

00:03:39.531 --> 00:03:41.780
And sometimes I'll go like,
this cat came to the show.

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.321
And people are like, what do
you mean a cat came to the show?

00:03:44.321 --> 00:03:48.860
And I'm like, we allow animals,
but I mean a man or a dude.

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:51.480
So here, I define cat. "Noun.

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:52.710
Not the one with four paws.

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:53.950
Picture Miles Davis.

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:55.780
Now picture him
walking away from you.

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.620
That's one mean cat.

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.670
In a sentence, 'Man that
cat, Ornette Coleman,

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:01.860
is nuts.' Thelonius Monk."

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:02.500
"Feminist.

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:03.830
A misunderstood word.

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:05.780
Feminism is simply the
idea that men and women

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.410
are equal and should
be treated like equals.

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:10.320
For some men, this
is truly terrifying,

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.590
like being disagreed
with or told no.

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.340
There exists a male
rights movement.

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:16.420
This is a nonstarter.

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:17.589
Men have all the rights.

00:04:17.589 --> 00:04:19.979
Somebody needs to
learn to share."

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:22.520
"In a sentence, 'People call me
a feminist whenever I express

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.980
sentiments that differentiate
me from a doormat

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:28.710
or a prostitute.' Rebecca West."

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.090
Oligarchy, there's a word
that you hear on the news

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:33.400
all the time and in the media.

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.485
And I wanted to define it
because these words get

00:04:35.485 --> 00:04:37.860
bandied around, and no one
ever tells you what they mean.

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.970
And people wander through
their whole lives never knowing

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:43.380
what these actually mean,
oligarchy and plutocracy

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:44.690
and things like that.

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:46.810
"A government in which
a small group exercises

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:49.820
control, especially for
corrupt and selfish purposes.

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:50.950
This could never happen.

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:54.120
Go back to sleep."

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:58.100
Polybius, the Greek historian,
said, "Monarchy degenerates

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:01.370
into tyranny, aristocracy
into oligarchy, and democracy

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:03.970
into savage violence and chaos."

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.360
That about sums it up
here in America, I think,

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.330
the savage violence and chaos.

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:12.980
Plutocracy-- you hear
that one bandied around--

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:15.110
"'a country that is ruled
by the richest people.

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:19.610
The most accurate word currently
in our possession.' Ramsey

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:20.110
Clark."

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:23.110
I noticed the uneasy
laughter on that one there.

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:25.210
I assume we're being
watched at all times here.

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:33.340
Let's see here.

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:34.860
Here's a good one.

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:36.640
"Freedom.

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:39.200
The power or right to act,
speak, or think as one

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:41.110
wants without
hindrance or restraint.

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:44.030
This term is overused by people
who do not believe in it.

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:45.960
It's rarely practiced
in real life.

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:47.130
Freedom is quite subjective.

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:50.100
Most people find it a bit
too much responsibility.

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:51.570
Governments and
large institutions

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:53.280
like to put parameters
on it so everyone

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:54.821
will feel comfortable
with not having

00:05:54.821 --> 00:05:57.060
to think for themselves."

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:00.040
This is from Ambrose Bierce,
"Devil's Dictionary."

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:02.620
"'A political condition that
every nation supposes itself

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:04.610
to enjoy in virtual monopoly.'"

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:05.329
"Liberty.

00:06:05.329 --> 00:06:07.120
The distinction between
freedom and liberty

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:08.700
is not accurately known.

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:10.770
Naturalists have never
been able to find

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:13.380
a living specimen of either."

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:15.870
That was a joke.

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:16.560
Let's see here.

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:18.290
I say "groovy" a lot.

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:22.610
And I know a lot of the kids
here think that's real arcane.

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:25.010
But I grew up in the '60s.

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:26.730
I mean, I wasn't a
teenager in the '60s.

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:27.460
I'm not that old.

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:29.330
I was a child in the '60s.

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:32.380
I barely remember it.

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:33.280
"Groovy.

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:34.210
Adjective.

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:36.750
Anything or anyone, fas
scootch that rings your chimes,

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:38.390
floats your lifeboat,
rubs your kitten,

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:40.640
or bangs your shiny bronze gong.

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:43.220
Groovy is associated
with kitschy '60s cliches

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:44.870
like bell-bottoms and headbands.

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:46.900
But groovy was before
and will always be.

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:48.430
A groove is a good
thing to be in.

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:51.550
When you don't have the groove,
well, it is hard to move."

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:54.740
In a sentence-- so I
show you how to use it--

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:56.740
"I loves that ambient jam.

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:59.330
It is so groovy.

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:01.650
It would be so groovy if
you filled that bong again

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:05.460
with the Kushberry Crunch."

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:08.670
Man bag is something I
use a little too much,

00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:13.140
but I think you'll get the idea.

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:17.220
"The pouch where
the jewels are kept.

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:18.580
Pejorative, as well.

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:20.170
Be tender with its usage.

00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:24.496
In a sentence, why does this
movie osculate man bag?"

00:07:24.496 --> 00:07:26.120
That would be in
reference to any movie

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:29.070
that the Green Lantern is in.

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:30.510
"Who brought the man bag beer?

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:34.500
Was it that gimme-cap
over by the kiddie pool?"

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:37.930
Man branch, I think you'll
follow on this one, too.

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:40.800
"The disco stick, the candy
twig, the Tootsie Pop.

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:42.820
The appendage men focus
on to the exclusion

00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:44.080
of all other things.

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:44.970
Where the action is.

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:46.440
The blissmas tree.

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:47.720
Co-pilot."

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:48.220
Thank you.

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:49.950
I wrote that.

00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:52.720
I was pretty happy
with that one myself.

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:57.630
"Co-pilot, kickstand, love
mop, little bro, the obelisk.

00:07:57.630 --> 00:08:01.470
In a sentence--" this is how
you would use man branch-- "Thou

00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:04.830
villain, I invite you to take a
beefy nourishing bite of my man

00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:07.009
branch."

00:08:07.009 --> 00:08:08.800
This is the one I wanted
to get to, though,

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:10.650
because I think it's useful.

00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:17.970
People overuse the adjective
"Orwellian" all the time.

00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:21.500
And nobody has ever read "1984."

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:23.200
People have skimmed
it or whatever.

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:24.605
But you know the plot of "1984."

00:08:24.605 --> 00:08:27.670
It's a futuristic society
where we're being watched

00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:29.420
at all times by the government.

00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:32.200
So now it's not a
futuristic society anymore.

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:33.799
It's kind of our society.

00:08:33.799 --> 00:08:37.107
We're in an endless war with an
unseen enemy that'll never end.

00:08:37.107 --> 00:08:38.940
And anyone who's against
you is a terrorist.

00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:40.648
And Big Brother watches
you all the time.

00:08:40.648 --> 00:08:43.150
So it's kind of like now.

00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:45.250
"Anything that is in
opposition to a free society,

00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:49.240
in reference to George Orwell,
author of '1984.' Overused

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:50.780
by those have not read Orwell.

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:53.800
'1984' is what people like
to call a dystopian novel.

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:57.400
The fallacy there is
dystopias are imaginary places

00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:58.550
where people live in fear.

00:08:58.550 --> 00:09:00.770
Orwell is dead, but rest
assured he's spinning

00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:03.430
like a bobbin in his grave."

00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:07.600
Bobbin are on a sewing machine--
I'll be explaining everything

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:09.584
as it goes along.

00:09:09.584 --> 00:09:10.500
Are you on your phone?

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:11.570
Or are you live-tweeting this?

00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:13.380
Because if you're live-tweeting
this, I'll dictate to you.

00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:15.040
Greg's sexual power
was undeniable.

00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:19.240
As he stood there,
I was reminded

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:23.520
of a jungle cat that gave off
emanations of testosterone.

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:26.700
My ovaries started
clanging like sleigh bells.

00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:29.540
And I went off like
a volcano in Iceland.

00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:30.670
That's over 140 characters.

00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:31.169
Retweet.

00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:35.750
Love.

00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:36.560
"Noun.

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:38.300
We all knows it
when we feels it.

00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:40.560
Most humans are striving
for a semblance of it.

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:43.330
In our current era, love is on
the ropes, what with sexting,

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:48.085
pornography, boy
singers, and furries."

00:09:48.085 --> 00:09:49.960
I mean, I'm down with
the idea of dressing up

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:51.480
like a stuffed
animal to have sex.

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:55.010
It's just the smell.

00:09:55.010 --> 00:09:56.309
And isn't it sweaty?

00:09:56.309 --> 00:09:58.350
What do you wear-- I mean,
how much talcum powder

00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:01.310
can you put on?

00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:03.234
"So confusing in so
many subtle variants.

00:10:03.234 --> 00:10:04.650
It's cool to love
roller coasters,

00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:06.010
but hard to love vultures.

00:10:06.010 --> 00:10:08.219
One may love fudge, but
hate brownie eaters.

00:10:08.219 --> 00:10:10.760
Look can hurt and be in vain,
but still the most sought-after

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:11.350
feeling.

00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:12.724
Love is why we
are here on Earth.

00:10:12.724 --> 00:10:14.560
The problem is that
hate is easier for lots

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:15.850
of individuals than love.

00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:18.350
It feels more comfortable, and
huge groups can do it better.

00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:20.141
Plus, you get to carry
poorly spelled signs

00:10:20.141 --> 00:10:22.530
and wear hoods and whatnot.

00:10:22.530 --> 00:10:24.680
Loves is 'The Smartest
Book's' favorite usage.

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:28.290
In a sentence, oh my kittens,
that leather jacket-- loves.

00:10:28.290 --> 00:10:29.170
I loves you.

00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:31.270
I knows."

00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:32.949
Let's see here.

00:10:32.949 --> 00:10:34.490
This is the one I
wanted to read you.

00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:36.114
It's at the very
beginning of the book.

00:10:36.114 --> 00:10:38.900
There's no table of contents,
I noticed to my dismay,

00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:40.560
when the book was published.

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:42.390
I had many chances to
go through the book

00:10:42.390 --> 00:10:45.940
and amend it and rewrite
and-- what do they call it?

00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:47.900
Edit?

00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:52.090
But I'm a comedian so I was
busy getting high and being

00:10:52.090 --> 00:10:52.670
in Hawaii.

00:10:52.670 --> 00:10:54.120
So I didn't.

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:55.620
But then I noticed
the book came out

00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:56.780
and there was no
table of contents.

00:10:56.780 --> 00:10:58.670
There is, however, a
list of commandments

00:10:58.670 --> 00:11:01.310
at the outset that tells you
what's going to be in the book.

00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:04.700
And there's movies,
poetry, Satchel Paige.

00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:06.450
Satchel Paige played
in the Negro leagues.

00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:09.230
He was a baseball player who
played before the big leagues

00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:09.897
were integrated.

00:11:09.897 --> 00:11:12.563
Yes, there was a time in America
where black people were treated

00:11:12.563 --> 00:11:13.790
like second class citizens.

00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:16.950
It could never happen again.

00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:18.820
Music, there'll be no whining.

00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:20.206
There'll be art.

00:11:20.206 --> 00:11:20.830
Let's see here.

00:11:20.830 --> 00:11:23.132
And then we'll spell
woman with a capital W.

00:11:23.132 --> 00:11:25.090
And I just wanted to read
a little bit of this.

00:11:25.090 --> 00:11:27.006
And then we'll go into
the questions, I think.

00:11:27.006 --> 00:11:29.637
Or if I can find something else
that's humorous, I'll read it.

00:11:29.637 --> 00:11:30.470
You should be, Greg.

00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:31.845
It's your book,
and you wrote it.

00:11:31.845 --> 00:11:34.950
Well, give me-- Get off my dick.

00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:36.820
"We will spell women
with a capital W.

00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:38.570
There's a movement by
all men in the world

00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:40.460
to make sure women
don't get a fair shake.

00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:42.180
Men yell at women from cars.

00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:43.950
Men deny women equal pay.

00:11:43.950 --> 00:11:45.640
Men tell women to smile."

00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:48.500
And that one really
gets me because has

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:50.700
a woman ever come up to
you, gentlemen, and gone,

00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:51.405
hey, smile.

00:11:51.405 --> 00:11:53.530
You're too cute in that
flannel shirt and the beard

00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:55.400
not to smile.

00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:55.985
Nice package.

00:11:55.985 --> 00:11:57.980
You delivering that for UPS?

00:11:57.980 --> 00:12:03.590
[GROWL] And yet, men feel free
to do it to women all the time.

00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:05.980
And then men do things like
where phones on their belts

00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:09.490
and expect people
to talk to them.

00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:11.110
Men wear phones on their belts.

00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:13.260
And then they always
have a rationale.

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:16.600
They're like, oh,
it's convenient.

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:19.460
And you're like, yeah, it is for
forming an anti-pussy perimeter

00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:23.010
around you that no
pussy can permeate.

00:12:23.010 --> 00:12:25.490
No woman has ever looked at a
man with a phone on his belt

00:12:25.490 --> 00:12:27.010
and gone, oh, my god.

00:12:27.010 --> 00:12:29.832
I bet he can answer a
call whenever he gets one.

00:12:29.832 --> 00:12:32.290
It's more like, I bet that his
grandmother's basement where

00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:34.310
he lives is so commodious.

00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:37.230
He must play World of
Warcraft or The Frosty Dawn

00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:40.640
and have all of the
"Harry Potter" figures.

00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:43.530
Yeah, guys wear baseball
caps out at night?

00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:44.055
Really?

00:12:44.055 --> 00:12:45.430
Why don't you just
wear a T-shirt

00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:48.096
that says I have roofies because
that's what the baseball cap is

00:12:48.096 --> 00:12:48.732
saying.

00:12:48.732 --> 00:12:51.190
The baseball cap is saying no
means yes and yes means anal.

00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:53.940
That's what the baseball
cap is telling everyone.

00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:55.760
Or am I to understand
that you're

00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:58.750
a gangster from Park Slope?

00:12:58.750 --> 00:13:00.190
Is that what's happening?

00:13:00.190 --> 00:13:01.870
That you've rolled
into town, and you're

00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:03.800
going to be who-banging
with your crew four deep?

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:05.758
Skeeting at all the fly
hos and smoking blunts?

00:13:05.758 --> 00:13:06.849
Is that what I'm getting?

00:13:06.849 --> 00:13:08.640
That you're going to
wet me with your jammy

00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:10.560
if some shit goes down?

00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:12.560
I've never understood the
baseball cap at night.

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:13.974
It's really-- wow.

00:13:13.974 --> 00:13:15.390
You don't really
see women wearing

00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:18.219
a fucking hard hat when they
go out with their girlfriends.

00:13:18.219 --> 00:13:20.760
But they should because that's
the kind of men they run into.

00:13:25.252 --> 00:13:26.210
That's not in the book.

00:13:26.210 --> 00:13:26.950
But it is funny.

00:13:29.510 --> 00:13:31.970
"Men enact laws to keep women
from health care they need.

00:13:31.970 --> 00:13:32.940
This is not an opinion.

00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:33.820
This is fact."

00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:37.100
For instance, I believe that
a woman dreamed the universe

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:38.055
into existence.

00:13:38.055 --> 00:13:39.680
And that's why it's
called the Big Bang

00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:42.290
theory because
only a woman could

00:13:42.290 --> 00:13:45.990
have had a reverberation so
profound and so cataclysmic

00:13:45.990 --> 00:13:49.790
that the very fabric of the
cosmos was born out of that.

00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:52.010
If a man had given
birth to the university,

00:13:52.010 --> 00:13:55.480
it would be called the
Disappointing Early theory.

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:57.450
And every galaxy would
be the Milky Way.

00:13:57.450 --> 00:14:01.180
And by the way,
this isn't a theory.

00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:02.630
This is a fact
that I thought of.

00:14:06.899 --> 00:14:09.190
"The reason is women dream
the universe into existence.

00:14:09.190 --> 00:14:09.898
Women give birth.

00:14:09.898 --> 00:14:11.280
Men take life.

00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:13.740
If a man had done it"-- "men
can only give birth to sacred

00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:16.435
bullets through their
Viagra-assisted man shaft.

00:14:16.435 --> 00:14:18.060
Women deal with the
pain of childbirth.

00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:21.079
Men act like they have
diphtheria if they get a cold.

00:14:21.079 --> 00:14:22.870
We all know Columbus
and George Washington.

00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:24.710
But who's talking about
Sojourner Truth or Susan B

00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:25.390
Anthony?"

00:14:25.390 --> 00:14:27.669
Or Shirley Chisholm,
for that matter?

00:14:27.669 --> 00:14:29.210
"Women in the United
States could not

00:14:29.210 --> 00:14:31.750
vote until 1920, then only
because they demanded it

00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:32.439
for years.

00:14:32.439 --> 00:14:33.855
Any advances women
have made, they

00:14:33.855 --> 00:14:36.400
had done by organizing, being
better at everything than men.

00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:38.630
Just to be recognized
and heard, they have to.

00:14:38.630 --> 00:14:40.100
A few things to
ponder as you seek

00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:41.740
to improve and
enlighten yourself out

00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:43.690
of the depths of your ignorance.

00:14:43.690 --> 00:14:47.570
Germany, New Zealand, Argentina,
India, Chile, Brazil, Pakistan,

00:14:47.570 --> 00:14:50.460
the UK, Ireland, Canada,
and Australia--" and I'll

00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:51.920
add Switzerland
in there as well--

00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:53.670
"to name but a few
have had women leaders.

00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:55.740
The USA has not.

00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:57.800
Women, as of right, now
dominate publishing.

00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:00.020
JK Rowling is the most
read author on Earth.

00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:02.270
Telling a woman to smile as
an imposition and a demand

00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:03.353
you have no right to make.

00:15:03.353 --> 00:15:05.475
Don't Use the term 'old
lady' as a pejorative."

00:15:05.475 --> 00:15:06.600
You hear that all the time.

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:07.680
It's like an old lady.

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:09.210
It was weak like an old lady.

00:15:09.210 --> 00:15:10.482
I cried like an old lady.

00:15:10.482 --> 00:15:12.440
"Old women raise the
world and know everything.

00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:13.679
They're anything but weak.

00:15:13.679 --> 00:15:15.220
When you go into a
bar or restaurant,

00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:17.860
notice if the woman servers
are made to wear hot outfits.

00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:19.527
Consider which places
make men do that."

00:15:19.527 --> 00:15:22.068
When was the last time you went
into a bar in New York and it

00:15:22.068 --> 00:15:22.904
was called Willie's?

00:15:22.904 --> 00:15:24.820
And dudes were walking
around with jock straps

00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:25.660
with butt plugs in?

00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:26.880
Do you know what I'm saying?

00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:28.770
But you could go to any number
of bars where women have

00:15:28.770 --> 00:15:31.269
to skate around in mini-skirts
or whatnot so the guys can go

00:15:31.269 --> 00:15:32.706
[SNORTING], I'll have the wings.

00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:37.430
"Victoria's Secret
has a TV special.

00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:39.475
Calvin Klein's
men undies do not.

00:15:39.475 --> 00:15:41.600
Women are the majority of
the workers in the world.

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:42.558
That don't get equal--"

00:15:42.558 --> 00:15:44.590
Oh, you don't have
to turn that up.

00:15:44.590 --> 00:15:46.920
Was it me or did
the lights go up?

00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:50.830
Or did I just hallucinate that?

00:15:50.830 --> 00:15:52.490
All I can offer
you is the truth.

00:15:52.490 --> 00:15:54.180
If you take the
blue pill, you'll

00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:56.720
go back to where you were.

00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:58.830
Let's see here.

00:15:58.830 --> 00:15:59.820
This part's hilarious.

00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:02.380
"Women are regularly assaulted,
raped, beaten, abused,

00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:04.310
murdered, sold, and
disappeared everywhere.

00:16:04.310 --> 00:16:05.730
That means in America as well.

00:16:05.730 --> 00:16:08.760
This is not the top
story in the news ever."

00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:12.510
It's my assertion that if women
were looked after and made

00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:14.390
equal and there were
some sort of parity,

00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:17.074
that that would solve all
the problems of the world.

00:16:17.074 --> 00:16:18.740
I'm not sure why
everyone doesn't see it

00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:21.790
the way I do other than
everyone does have no vision

00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:24.040
and I have progressives.

00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:24.690
Thank you.

00:16:24.690 --> 00:16:27.740
Progressives are
the glasses that--

00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:36.780
Because when you look out--
Let me put it this way.

00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:39.190
When it's as easy
to get an abortion

00:16:39.190 --> 00:16:41.630
as it is to obtain a
gun, then you can tell me

00:16:41.630 --> 00:16:43.249
there's equity in the world.

00:16:43.249 --> 00:16:45.040
And the reason why it's
so easy to get guns

00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:47.540
is because men love guns
because men want guns.

00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:49.680
But guns are to protect
our safety and freedom.

00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:50.710
Mhm.

00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:52.650
That hasn't really happened yet.

00:16:52.650 --> 00:16:54.560
I never feel safe
when guns are around.

00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:57.160
And I don't feel like my
safety or freedom is protected.

00:16:57.160 --> 00:17:00.250
Guns are for men to kill people
they're afraid of, as far as I

00:17:00.250 --> 00:17:01.010
can figure out.

00:17:01.010 --> 00:17:02.440
And for the rich
to get the police

00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:04.659
to kill the poor
on behalf of them.

00:17:04.659 --> 00:17:05.950
Thank you for laughing at that.

00:17:05.950 --> 00:17:07.260
I appreciate that.

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:09.160
It is a joke.

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:12.000
And it's also true.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:12.625
Let's see here.

00:17:12.625 --> 00:17:14.291
"There'll be good
drugs and good times."

00:17:14.291 --> 00:17:16.140
We talk about drugs
and drink in the book.

00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:17.839
"Light one up and pour
one down, and let's all

00:17:17.839 --> 00:17:19.547
get together and put
on wings like Icarus

00:17:19.547 --> 00:17:21.040
and see how high
we can go to night

00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:22.730
before the horrible
flaming demon sun

00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:25.020
that man made out of this
hideous nuclear agenda

00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:26.730
burns our delicate
artistic wings

00:17:26.730 --> 00:17:28.700
and sends our sensitive
behinds spiraling back

00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:31.865
to the ground like a burned
McNugget full of regret.

00:17:31.865 --> 00:17:34.240
Or let's just horse around
until something funny happens.

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:37.720
And if you're clean and
sober, hurray for you.

00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:40.472
Be a lamb chop, and
go get the corkscrew.

00:17:40.472 --> 00:17:42.430
Oh, and fill the ice
bucket, will you, Darling?

00:17:42.430 --> 00:17:45.162
You can drive
everyone home later."

00:17:45.162 --> 00:17:47.120
I think we've had enough
reading from the book.

00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:49.250
I know I have.

00:17:49.250 --> 00:17:50.712
Does anyone want
to do questions?

00:17:50.712 --> 00:17:51.920
I think there's a microphone.

00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:53.540
Do people have to go
over to the microphone?

00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:55.831
Or is someone going to walk
around with the microphone?

00:17:55.831 --> 00:17:56.857
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:56.857 --> 00:17:58.690
GREG PROOPS: Oh, they
have to walk up to it?

00:17:58.690 --> 00:17:59.850
Oh, OK.

00:17:59.850 --> 00:18:01.375
Will people walk up to the mic?

00:18:01.375 --> 00:18:02.500
Actually you don't have to.

00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:03.541
You can just yell it out.

00:18:03.541 --> 00:18:05.640
This is a pretty small room.

00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:06.710
No one has any questions?

00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:08.510
You're going to let me stand
here for-- There you are.

00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:09.135
Well done, sir.

00:18:09.135 --> 00:18:09.634
Thank you.

00:18:09.634 --> 00:18:11.430
AUDIENCE: Thank you
for coming to Google.

00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:12.930
Clearly, you don't
get enough chance

00:18:12.930 --> 00:18:14.406
to do stand-up
and improv comedy.

00:18:14.406 --> 00:18:15.780
But I've loved following
your improv before.

00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:16.370
GREG PROOPS: Thank you.

00:18:16.370 --> 00:18:18.100
AUDIENCE: What are you
enjoying doing most right now?

00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:20.120
GREG PROOPS: The podcast
is my favorite thing to do,

00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:21.703
although I'm really
enjoying this book

00:18:21.703 --> 00:18:24.560
tour because the chance to
talk about yourself endlessly

00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:28.270
and how clever you are is a
rare opportunity to feed my ego.

00:18:28.270 --> 00:18:29.890
And of course, if
you're a comedian,

00:18:29.890 --> 00:18:32.770
there's that particular quirk
of having the gaping void where

00:18:32.770 --> 00:18:33.720
a personality is.

00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:38.070
And instead I want to
shallow love of strangers.

00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:39.301
Every 15 to 30 seconds.

00:18:39.301 --> 00:18:40.300
I demand their approval.

00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:43.400
And it's a particular
kind of sickness.

00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:45.060
But I love the
podcast most of all

00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:50.240
because it combines
improvisation, which I usually

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:53.200
riff it, and then I can go into
the boring, preachy part where

00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:55.740
I talk about all my
poisoned liberal politics.

00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:57.830
And I don't have to get
a laugh every 30 seconds.

00:18:57.830 --> 00:18:59.760
When you do stand-up,
there's a real demand

00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:02.500
that you get a laugh every 30
seconds because the audience,

00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:04.290
that's what they're there
to-- and they have every right

00:19:04.290 --> 00:19:04.831
to expect it.

00:19:04.831 --> 00:19:06.777
They paid money for that.

00:19:06.777 --> 00:19:08.360
But with the podcast,
I can stretch it

00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:09.300
out a little bit more.

00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:11.610
And also, we had the chance
to go all over the world.

00:19:11.610 --> 00:19:13.547
Like we did a podcast
in Brooklyn last night.

00:19:13.547 --> 00:19:14.880
Brooklyn is where you guys live.

00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:21.420
And then we're in Philly, which
is where some of you are from.

00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:25.860
And then we're going to Chicago,
San Diego, Portland, San

00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:26.440
Francisco.

00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:31.500
Last year, we were in Amsterdam,
Stockholm, Helsinki, Paris,

00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:34.419
London, Edinburgh,
Toronto, Montreal.

00:19:34.419 --> 00:19:36.460
So it gives me the chance
to go around the world.

00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:38.376
And it's because of the
magic of the inter-web

00:19:38.376 --> 00:19:40.170
and the smartphone.

00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:42.450
You don't have to be on
telly anymore and all that.

00:19:42.450 --> 00:19:43.824
There's that
immediate connection

00:19:43.824 --> 00:19:46.700
that we all have because
of the instantaneous nature

00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:49.530
and the on-demand nature
of putting out a podcast.

00:19:49.530 --> 00:19:51.669
People listen to it in
their car or when they're

00:19:51.669 --> 00:19:53.210
walking their dog
or whatever they're

00:19:53.210 --> 00:19:55.900
doing in any country
all of the world.

00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:59.610
So I found that technology is
a fantastic boon to comedy,

00:19:59.610 --> 00:20:03.980
and that the personal
nature of the podcast.

00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:06.090
It's like a phone conversation.

00:20:06.090 --> 00:20:07.220
Many of you have had them.

00:20:07.220 --> 00:20:08.636
Most of you just
text now, but you

00:20:08.636 --> 00:20:10.050
know what I'm talking about.

00:20:10.050 --> 00:20:12.569
What I mean is the intimacy
of talking into someone's ear.

00:20:12.569 --> 00:20:14.860
Because I don't think of it
as a giant group of people.

00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:16.526
I think of it as
talking to individuals.

00:20:16.526 --> 00:20:18.890
And that's what's made
it so profound for me.

00:20:18.890 --> 00:20:21.080
I talk about poetry a lot
on the show, and drugs.

00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:23.080
And people give me books
about poetry and drugs.

00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:24.780
And it's really nice.

00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:26.960
Sometimes at the same time.

00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:28.040
Thank you for asking.

00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:30.660
By the way, "Whose Line" is
back on, if you were wondering.

00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:32.450
It's on the CW now.

00:20:32.450 --> 00:20:37.295
So if you like vampires,
we're on your network, baby.

00:20:37.295 --> 00:20:39.170
I don't know about night
of the week it's on,

00:20:39.170 --> 00:20:39.840
but it's on one of them.

00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:40.964
And it's still all this us.

00:20:40.964 --> 00:20:44.800
It's bald guy, the black
guy, the tall guy, and me.

00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:46.070
Thank you.

00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:48.060
Yes, sir?

00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:50.400
AUDIENCE: As a man who
knows everything, does

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:51.680
that mean you have a rivalry--

00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:52.600
GREG PROOPS: Are you
speaking for you yourself,

00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:53.641
or are you addressing me?

00:20:53.641 --> 00:20:55.900
AUDIENCE: As you, as you.

00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:57.920
So do you have a
rivalry with John

00:20:57.920 --> 00:20:59.154
Hodgman, who also believes--

00:20:59.154 --> 00:21:00.320
GREG PROOPS: Oh, not at all.

00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:00.819
No.

00:21:00.819 --> 00:21:03.110
John and I get
along really well.

00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:05.630
His neck beard is a
little off-putting.

00:21:05.630 --> 00:21:08.429
But no, he's a
judge of everything.

00:21:08.429 --> 00:21:09.470
There's a big difference.

00:21:09.470 --> 00:21:13.110
I adjudicate from time to time,
but mostly I just pontificate.

00:21:13.110 --> 00:21:18.830
And so I'm happy to have him sit
on the Supreme Court of comedy.

00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:21.805
And if it was my choice, he
would be an associate justice.

00:21:21.805 --> 00:21:25.730
I wouldn't make him chief
justice because he's a man.

00:21:25.730 --> 00:21:27.630
But I love John Hodgman.

00:21:27.630 --> 00:21:28.580
He's very funny.

00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:30.496
I don't know what he
does, but it's wonderful.

00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:36.487
Well, that concludes the
question portion of the show.

00:21:36.487 --> 00:21:38.570
I'm going to stand here
awkwardly and stare at you

00:21:38.570 --> 00:21:39.930
for the next half hour now.

00:21:39.930 --> 00:21:42.819
Does anyone else want
to ask a question?

00:21:42.819 --> 00:21:43.860
I'm happy to answer them.

00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:44.983
I really am.

00:21:44.983 --> 00:21:45.525
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:21:45.525 --> 00:21:46.649
GREG PROOPS: There you are.

00:21:46.649 --> 00:21:47.150
Hi.

00:21:47.150 --> 00:21:48.774
AUDIENCE: First of
all, you're awesome.

00:21:48.774 --> 00:21:49.420
Thank you.

00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:49.860
GREG PROOPS: Thank you.

00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:50.630
That is correct.

00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:51.630
AUDIENCE: Your podcast--

00:21:51.630 --> 00:21:52.629
GREG PROOPS: And humble.

00:21:52.629 --> 00:21:53.230
Fuck.

00:21:53.230 --> 00:21:55.780
AUDIENCE: --shows that you're
essentially a Renaissance man.

00:21:55.780 --> 00:21:56.920
You're interested
in a lot of topics.

00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:58.485
So how did you decide
what topics you

00:21:58.485 --> 00:22:01.970
were going to put into
the book out of the sum

00:22:01.970 --> 00:22:03.382
total of history, I guess?

00:22:03.382 --> 00:22:05.090
GREG PROOPS: Thank
you for that question.

00:22:05.090 --> 00:22:10.777
It was very difficult
to choose which ones.

00:22:10.777 --> 00:22:12.360
But I knew that the
initial ones would

00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:14.170
be books and records, movies.

00:22:14.170 --> 00:22:16.950
And my wife and I do the Greg
Proops Film Club as well.

00:22:16.950 --> 00:22:19.470
We show pictures
every-- I mean, movies.

00:22:19.470 --> 00:22:21.280
I told you I talked in jive.

00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:23.200
You know, motion pictures.

00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:27.970
We show pictures every month in
Los Angeles at the Cinefamily.

00:22:27.970 --> 00:22:31.830
And a lot of the movies that
we talk about on that podcast

00:22:31.830 --> 00:22:33.810
are in this book as well.

00:22:33.810 --> 00:22:35.310
It was the ancient
history chapters

00:22:35.310 --> 00:22:37.790
because I tend to draw
analogies all the time

00:22:37.790 --> 00:22:41.240
between ancient Greece
and Rome and now.

00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:44.160
Ancient Rome was embroiled in
a series of wars in the Middle

00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:45.970
East in Afghanistan
that destroyed

00:22:45.970 --> 00:22:48.170
their empire and
their slave culture

00:22:48.170 --> 00:22:51.370
and their lack of forward
thinking and their belief

00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:53.544
that all other foreign
cultures were barbarians

00:22:53.544 --> 00:22:55.710
and that they were the
superior culture in the world

00:22:55.710 --> 00:22:57.780
and that their Senate was
bought-and-sold, paid-for rich

00:22:57.780 --> 00:23:00.113
oligarchs who were working
at the behest of the emperor.

00:23:00.113 --> 00:23:02.440
So you get the analogy.

00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:04.530
So I wrote these
Leviathan chapters

00:23:04.530 --> 00:23:06.650
on Julius Caesar and
Alexander the Great.

00:23:06.650 --> 00:23:08.920
And my editor Matthew
is here today.

00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:10.170
We cut them down.

00:23:10.170 --> 00:23:11.890
They were a
gajillion words long.

00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:13.210
So that was one thing.

00:23:13.210 --> 00:23:15.240
And then there was a few
other-- I would always

00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:16.240
talk about stealing art.

00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:20.620
My wife and I were at a museum
in Paris called the Marmottan.

00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:22.080
It was a fabulous museum.

00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:25.510
It's full Monets and all
these beautiful French

00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:26.360
impressionists.

00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:30.272
And there was an open window
and a parking lot right there.

00:23:30.272 --> 00:23:31.730
And I was like,
Jennifer, I'm going

00:23:31.730 --> 00:23:33.430
to have a petit mal seizure.

00:23:33.430 --> 00:23:35.240
And you grab a
picture off the wall

00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:36.820
and throw it out
the fucking window.

00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:38.490
And I'll meet you
downstairs in five minutes.

00:23:38.490 --> 00:23:40.070
And then we'll get
a bus out of here.

00:23:40.070 --> 00:23:42.140
And I thought it would be
that easy to steal art.

00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:44.320
So I started talking
about it on the show.

00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:47.930
And then I realized,
it's a very shaky slope

00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:50.720
to encourage people
to steal fine art.

00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:53.170
And so I don't encourage
anyone to steal art

00:23:53.170 --> 00:23:57.340
unless your plan is foolproof,
in which case meet me outside.

00:23:57.340 --> 00:23:58.070
I'm in a van.

00:23:58.070 --> 00:23:59.900
It has a horse
painted on the side.

00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:03.290
And I answer to Miguel.

00:24:03.290 --> 00:24:04.990
But that's how
most art is stolen.

00:24:04.990 --> 00:24:07.410
So I didn't know how to
approach that chapter.

00:24:07.410 --> 00:24:09.450
And Matthew said to
me, why don't you

00:24:09.450 --> 00:24:13.050
call it "10 Pieces of Art I
Wish I had the Balls to Steal."

00:24:13.050 --> 00:24:16.250
And so that's how
that got in there.

00:24:16.250 --> 00:24:17.980
So that was kind of the process.

00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:19.800
And it's one of my
favorite chapters.

00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:22.240
And I only chose
pieces of art so large,

00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:24.811
you couldn't
possibly steal them.

00:24:24.811 --> 00:24:26.560
Let me just read you
one here that I think

00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:28.362
is my favorite one.

00:24:28.362 --> 00:24:32.690
"El Mundo Magico de los
Mayas" by Leonora Carrington.

00:24:32.690 --> 00:24:36.800
It was at the Museum National
of Anthropology in Mexico City.

00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:38.463
Leonora Carrington,
blah, blah, blah.

00:24:41.052 --> 00:24:43.260
Every single one of them is
how we're going to steal,

00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:47.405
what the piece of art is,
and the chances of success.

00:24:47.405 --> 00:24:48.780
"She was given a
commission to do

00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:51.310
a mural about the pre-white
people history of Mexico

00:24:51.310 --> 00:24:53.270
and went to Chiapas
to study the area.

00:24:53.270 --> 00:24:56.020
She was introduced by the
anthropologist Gertrude Blom

00:24:56.020 --> 00:24:59.630
to the curanderos, or healers,
from the awesomely named town

00:24:59.630 --> 00:25:00.940
of Zinacantan.

00:25:00.940 --> 00:25:03.177
That means the land of bats.

00:25:03.177 --> 00:25:05.260
They normally didn't do
their thing for outsiders,

00:25:05.260 --> 00:25:07.093
but Ms. Carrington had
such a vast knowledge

00:25:07.093 --> 00:25:09.880
and respect for mysticism and
healing, they let her sit in.

00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:12.277
She studied the 'Popol
Vuh,' or people's history,

00:25:12.277 --> 00:25:14.360
which is the Mayan sacred
book of mysteries before

00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:15.540
the Conquistadors.

00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:17.550
From this, she painted
'The Magical World

00:25:17.550 --> 00:25:19.434
of the Mayas,'
which is enormous.

00:25:19.434 --> 00:25:21.100
The painting resides
in Chapultepec Park

00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:22.150
in Mexico City.

00:25:22.150 --> 00:25:24.979
So we should take a shamanistic
dose of psychoactive mushrooms

00:25:24.979 --> 00:25:26.520
that we have bought
from a lady named

00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:29.032
Carmalita we met in a bodega.

00:25:29.032 --> 00:25:30.490
We get too high
and start to freak,

00:25:30.490 --> 00:25:32.480
so we stop for
frescoes at a stand.

00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:35.290
The afternoon is still and
we can hear children playing.

00:25:35.290 --> 00:25:37.090
So your sense of
dread abates somewhat.

00:25:37.090 --> 00:25:38.596
And we sally to the museum.

00:25:38.596 --> 00:25:40.470
There in the warm glow
of altered perception,

00:25:40.470 --> 00:25:42.386
we become overwhelmed
by the astounding colors

00:25:42.386 --> 00:25:43.890
and fantastical motif.

00:25:43.890 --> 00:25:46.320
Imbued with a sense of
belonging to the universe,

00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:48.039
we abandon our notion
of physical theft

00:25:48.039 --> 00:25:50.580
and decide to have an unlikely
escapade in a brightly colored

00:25:50.580 --> 00:25:51.585
cab.

00:25:51.585 --> 00:25:53.960
Later, when we're coming down,
we have seafood enchiladas

00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:56.530
and revel in our re-found
sense of cosmic morality.

00:25:56.530 --> 00:25:57.700
So goes the flow.

00:25:57.700 --> 00:25:58.580
Chance of success?

00:25:58.580 --> 00:26:01.180
Mythical, like the
lizard god returning."

00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:03.780
So you see that we don't
actually steal things

00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:05.344
in every single part.

00:26:05.344 --> 00:26:07.510
Sometimes we just get high
and ride around in a cab.

00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:12.010
This is my favorite one now.

00:26:12.010 --> 00:26:16.650
And this is given to me by a
drugged-up friend in Montreal.

00:26:16.650 --> 00:26:18.140
I was working there last summer.

00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:19.920
And I told him I was writing
a chapter on stealing art.

00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:22.310
And he said what about
George W Bush's paintings?

00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:28.010
And I was, like, well, where
are George W Bush's paintings?

00:26:28.010 --> 00:26:30.020
And how does one steal them?

00:26:30.020 --> 00:26:30.750
Paintings.

00:26:30.750 --> 00:26:32.070
George W Bush.

00:26:32.070 --> 00:26:33.590
2010.

00:26:33.590 --> 00:26:35.160
Dick Cheney's fridge, Wyoming.

00:26:37.730 --> 00:26:40.400
"George W Bush was almost
voted president twice

00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:44.020
during the terror war
depression boom of the 2000s.

00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:45.840
Dick Cheney was
nominally vice president,

00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:47.860
but in reality he
was the shot caller.

00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:49.820
Since his retirement
from public life,

00:26:49.820 --> 00:26:52.500
W's has been his goal of
being the worst artist who

00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:55.790
ever held office since Hitler.

00:26:55.790 --> 00:26:58.250
His portraits of world
leaders he has met

00:26:58.250 --> 00:27:00.810
are a tribute to the
primitive school of art brut,

00:27:00.810 --> 00:27:04.550
or outsider art, usually
meaning art made by people

00:27:04.550 --> 00:27:09.240
from without the art world, such
as children or mental patients.

00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:11.550
Cheney's house in Wyoming
is filled with trophies

00:27:11.550 --> 00:27:13.540
and war crime memorabilia.

00:27:13.540 --> 00:27:16.290
We'd pitch up as an honor
guard with a band, uniforms

00:27:16.290 --> 00:27:17.130
and everything.

00:27:17.130 --> 00:27:18.650
We'd perform a
number on the lawn

00:27:18.650 --> 00:27:20.314
and ask to use the facilities.

00:27:20.314 --> 00:27:22.480
On our way to the loo, we'd
steal the Putin portrait

00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:24.970
off the refrigerator
and drive like fury.

00:27:24.970 --> 00:27:27.790
We can be at the Devil's
Tower-- non-ironic-- before noon

00:27:27.790 --> 00:27:28.950
and then freedom.

00:27:28.950 --> 00:27:29.740
Win-win.

00:27:29.740 --> 00:27:30.780
Chance of success?

00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:32.480
Like winning a war
in Afghanistan."

[AUDIENCE GROANS]

00:27:34.340 --> 00:27:35.820
Oh, golly.

00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:39.020
That one must have really hurt.

00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:41.230
Walk it the fuck
off, Google person.

00:27:41.230 --> 00:27:43.585
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.570
So you get the idea on
the art theft chapter.

00:27:47.570 --> 00:27:48.070
Really?

00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:50.194
If that was harsh for you,
what's the "Daily World"

00:27:50.194 --> 00:27:52.420
like in New York for you?

00:27:52.420 --> 00:27:55.411
This isn't the sweetest
city in the world.

00:27:55.411 --> 00:27:56.410
And any other questions?

00:27:56.410 --> 00:27:58.460
And then I think-- I don't
know how long this goes--

00:27:58.460 --> 00:27:58.800
then we're going to--

--sign books and shit like that.

00:28:00.383 --> 00:28:01.722
Oh, Jesus Christ.

00:28:01.722 --> 00:28:04.280
Don't ever sneak up
on me like that again.

00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:04.882
Yes, sir?

00:28:04.882 --> 00:28:05.590
What's your name?

00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:07.006
AUDIENCE: So you
mentioned poetry.

00:28:07.006 --> 00:28:11.330
And as like probably much of
this audience, I'm an engineer.

00:28:11.330 --> 00:28:14.370
And I've really
never got poetry.

00:28:14.370 --> 00:28:15.890
I've attempted.

00:28:15.890 --> 00:28:17.579
It's like jazz.

00:28:17.579 --> 00:28:18.370
It's too beyond me.

00:28:18.370 --> 00:28:18.720
You know what?

00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:19.390
I just don't get it.

00:28:19.390 --> 00:28:20.120
GREG PROOPS: Right.

00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:20.850
AUDIENCE: Can you help me?

00:28:20.850 --> 00:28:22.270
GREG PROOPS: Yes, of course.

00:28:22.270 --> 00:28:25.610
You're exactly the
kind of individual

00:28:25.610 --> 00:28:26.690
that this is aimed at.

00:28:26.690 --> 00:28:31.530
I realize that the demands
of work and making a living

00:28:31.530 --> 00:28:34.200
and just surviving
preclude a lot

00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:35.590
of poetry in people's lives.

00:28:35.590 --> 00:28:39.109
And that's why I think
there's poetry in everything.

00:28:39.109 --> 00:28:41.650
Inside your phone, of course,
all your imaginary friends live

00:28:41.650 --> 00:28:45.120
and all the pretend people
that you think you know.

00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:47.010
But if you look up
in the sky, there's

00:28:47.010 --> 00:28:50.946
a moon almost every night,
and stars, and wind.

00:28:50.946 --> 00:28:52.570
And you look around
New York, and then,

00:28:52.570 --> 00:28:53.850
oh, look, a giant rat.

00:28:53.850 --> 00:28:56.230
And I wonder where
that rat's going.

00:28:56.230 --> 00:28:58.940
And then you think about, oh,
the rat's going to the subway.

00:28:58.940 --> 00:29:01.440
And then inside the subway,
there's filth and whatnot.

00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:04.360
And look at the filth, how
it forms little swirls.

00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:07.370
So there's poetry,
really, in everything.

00:29:07.370 --> 00:29:09.037
You see flowers when
you're in New York.

00:29:09.037 --> 00:29:10.869
People have planted
flowers in flower boxes.

00:29:10.869 --> 00:29:12.830
Or you go to Union Square,
and the other day I

00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:15.920
saw a dude dancing to "Rock
With You" by Michael Jackson

00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:18.280
in front of the statue
of George Washington.

00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:21.410
And so he's found his
own poetry right here

00:29:21.410 --> 00:29:25.032
in this giant-ass ghetto
that is New York and shit.

00:29:25.032 --> 00:29:26.740
You may remember the
movie-- did you ever

00:29:26.740 --> 00:29:27.906
see the movie "Willy Wonka"?

00:29:27.906 --> 00:29:31.710
Not the Johnny Depp one, where
he's a pervert, but the Gene

00:29:31.710 --> 00:29:32.420
Wilder one.

00:29:32.420 --> 00:29:33.150
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:29:33.150 --> 00:29:34.220
GREG PROOPS: You
saw that one, right?

00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:36.820
And remember, they're licking
the wallpaper, and he goes,

00:29:36.820 --> 00:29:38.540
the raspberries taste
like raspberries,

00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:40.910
the snozzberries taste
like snozzberries.

00:29:40.910 --> 00:29:42.890
And the little horrible
rich girl goes, there's

00:29:42.890 --> 00:29:44.670
such thing as a snozzberry.

00:29:44.670 --> 00:29:48.260
And he grabs her face and he
goes, we are the music makers.

00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:50.160
And we are the
dreamers of dreams,

00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:53.350
wandering by lone sea breakers
or sitting by desolate streams,

00:29:53.350 --> 00:29:54.770
world movers and
world foresakers

00:29:54.770 --> 00:29:56.530
on whom the pale moon gleams.

00:29:56.530 --> 00:29:59.280
Yet we are the movers and
shakers of the world forever

00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:00.480
it seems.

00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:03.250
So you have to be a music maker.

00:30:03.250 --> 00:30:04.540
That's what the world's about.

00:30:04.540 --> 00:30:08.260
I understand that
poetry is bloody hard

00:30:08.260 --> 00:30:09.470
to get your mind around.

00:30:09.470 --> 00:30:11.490
I don't know if this
has helped you at all.

00:30:11.490 --> 00:30:13.640
I'm trying to find a poem
in here that-- there's

00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:17.179
a poem in here that is so bloody
long that Matthew, the editor,

00:30:17.179 --> 00:30:19.470
was like, you've got to write
a long intro to this poem

00:30:19.470 --> 00:30:22.350
'cause this poem takes
for-fucking-ever.

00:30:22.350 --> 00:30:23.540
So this was my suggestion.

00:30:23.540 --> 00:30:24.680
It's William Blake.

00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:25.750
Now William Blake--

00:30:25.750 --> 00:30:27.730
Sit down, young lady.

00:30:36.310 --> 00:30:37.807
I'm going to come
to your cubicle

00:30:37.807 --> 00:30:39.640
and then fucking stand
there and then leave.

00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:47.490
Well, I guess there's something
more exciting going on

00:30:47.490 --> 00:30:50.387
in the Google building, like
an endless series of numbers

00:30:50.387 --> 00:30:52.720
of the matrix that she has
to get back to at her fucking

00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:53.219
console.

00:30:53.219 --> 00:30:55.513
AUDIENCE: The Albanian
president is here today.

00:30:55.513 --> 00:30:56.346
GREG PROOPS: Who is?

00:30:56.346 --> 00:30:57.100
AUDIENCE: The
Albanian president.

00:30:57.100 --> 00:30:57.530
GREG PROOPS: Really?

00:30:57.530 --> 00:30:58.420
Again?

00:30:58.420 --> 00:31:02.070
You know, I can't shake
that son of a bitch.

00:31:02.070 --> 00:31:05.480
Everywhere I've
been in New York,

00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:09.480
there's been a Balkan
leader tagging on me.

00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:12.360
I had the defense minister
of [INAUDIBLE] two days ago

00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:15.090
at my show.

00:31:15.090 --> 00:31:17.530
I've been to Albania
and trust me-- mm.

00:31:20.450 --> 00:31:21.650
The Balkans are rough going.

00:31:21.650 --> 00:31:22.510
There's no dogs.

00:31:22.510 --> 00:31:23.197
Why, Greg?

00:31:23.197 --> 00:31:25.030
Because there's so much
unexploded ordinance

00:31:25.030 --> 00:31:26.970
in the ground from
their giant war

00:31:26.970 --> 00:31:30.020
that you don't see any
fucking animals anywhere.

00:31:30.020 --> 00:31:33.400
Well, I just thought I'd add
that note of-- poetry, was it,

00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:35.880
we were talking about?

00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:38.360
So you're telling me
that young lady split

00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:40.850
in the middle of a presentation
during the lunch hour

00:31:40.850 --> 00:31:44.300
to go meet the
president of Albania?

00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:46.250
No, you're just suggesting
that he was here.

00:31:46.250 --> 00:31:47.708
I don't even know
what his name is.

00:31:47.708 --> 00:31:48.930
Do we know what his name is?

00:31:48.930 --> 00:31:51.940
Albania had a king
up until the '40s.

00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:55.462
And his name was Zog.

00:31:55.462 --> 00:31:57.920
And he was played by Terence
Stamp in the "Superman" movie.

00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:05.326
King Zog is such a great name.

00:32:05.326 --> 00:32:08.300
I'm thinking of
changing my name.

00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:11.597
William Blake, or as they say
in the movie "Bull Durham,"

00:32:11.597 --> 00:32:12.180
William Blake.

00:32:12.180 --> 00:32:12.990
William Blake?

00:32:12.990 --> 00:32:15.080
William Blake!

00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:16.890
"William Blake saw
God when he was four.

00:32:16.890 --> 00:32:19.960
He had amazing hallucinations.

00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:22.200
At 10, he announced he
was going to be a painter.

00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:23.335
He took up poetry.

00:32:23.335 --> 00:32:25.460
One of his assignments was
to sketch the tombstones

00:32:25.460 --> 00:32:27.630
at Westminster Abbey.

00:32:27.630 --> 00:32:28.902
He was a real free thinker.

00:32:28.902 --> 00:32:31.360
He wrote much about it and he
hanged out--" or, I say here,

00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:33.095
"he rolled with Thomas Paine."

00:32:33.095 --> 00:32:34.470
Thomas Paine wrote
"Common Sense"

00:32:34.470 --> 00:32:37.630
that helped us
overthrow the British.

00:32:37.630 --> 00:32:38.720
"And Mary Wollstonecraft."

00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:41.550
Mary Wollstonecraft was
Mary Shelley's mother.

00:32:41.550 --> 00:32:45.100
And she was a feminist
from the 18th century.

00:32:45.100 --> 00:32:46.800
"Blake was working
on illustrations

00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:49.680
for Dante's 'Divine
Comedy.'" Let's see here.

00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:51.474
"This joint is
lengthy, but it rhymes.

00:32:51.474 --> 00:32:53.890
And you have to bend some of
the words to make them rhyme.

00:32:53.890 --> 00:32:55.660
I suggest the William
Blake cocktail--

00:32:55.660 --> 00:32:57.620
two ounces of anything
hard, wave your hand

00:32:57.620 --> 00:32:59.120
over the glass,
gaze at the heavens,

00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:03.140
and swallow all at once."

00:33:03.140 --> 00:33:05.390
I won't read the whole thing
because it's really long.

00:33:05.390 --> 00:33:06.890
But I'll read you
a couple of lines.

00:33:06.890 --> 00:33:09.100
"To see a world in a
grain of sand and heaven

00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:12.400
in a wild flower, hold infinity
in the palm of your hand

00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:14.050
and eternity in an hour."

00:33:14.050 --> 00:33:18.120
Now we've already experienced
eternity in an hour just now.

00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:21.896
So I think you can understand
where that one's coming from.

00:33:21.896 --> 00:33:23.270
And this is the
one that I always

00:33:23.270 --> 00:33:27.590
think about when I think
about America and the way

00:33:27.590 --> 00:33:31.920
we're inching toward oblivion
by ignoring that there's

00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:34.180
poor people in this country.

00:33:34.180 --> 00:33:36.120
Oh, if I can find the
bloody line there.

00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:42.100
Well, this is the line that you
hear often from William Blake.

00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:44.600
"Every morning, every night,
some are born to sweet delight.

00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:45.891
Some are born to sweet delight.

00:33:45.891 --> 00:33:47.450
Some are born to endless night.

00:33:47.450 --> 00:33:49.510
We're led to believe
a lie when we

00:33:49.510 --> 00:33:52.350
see not through the eye,
which was born in a night

00:33:52.350 --> 00:33:55.520
to perish in a night when the
soul slept in beams of light.

00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:58.160
God appears and God is light
to those poor souls who

00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:01.220
dwell in night but does a
human form display to those

00:34:01.220 --> 00:34:03.185
who dwell in realms of day.

00:34:03.185 --> 00:34:04.560
The one that I
always remember is

00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:06.410
the dog starved at
the master's gate

00:34:06.410 --> 00:34:07.702
predicts the ruin of the state.

00:34:07.702 --> 00:34:10.118
I don't know if that helps you
at all, but thank you-- Oh,

00:34:10.118 --> 00:34:11.040
you've sat down now.

00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:12.460
And you've disappeared.

00:34:12.460 --> 00:34:14.590
Thank you for asking that
question about poetry.

00:34:14.590 --> 00:34:16.380
Yes, aren't you the person
who brought me here?

00:34:16.380 --> 00:34:16.679
AUDIENCE: I am.

00:34:16.679 --> 00:34:17.420
But I also have a question.

00:34:17.420 --> 00:34:18.480
GREG PROOPS: Oh, go ahead.

00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:20.438
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so
obviously, you're at Google.

00:34:20.438 --> 00:34:22.900
And you're obviously
not very opinionated.

00:34:22.900 --> 00:34:23.857
GREG PROOPS: No.

00:34:23.857 --> 00:34:25.440
AUDIENCE: I wanted
to get your opinion

00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:31.230
on what you might tell
engineers who are here who

00:34:31.230 --> 00:34:32.760
have helped you write the book.

00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:34.260
What's your favorite
Google product?

00:34:34.260 --> 00:34:35.676
Who has helped you
write the book?

00:34:35.676 --> 00:34:38.179
What has helped you
publish the book here?

00:34:38.179 --> 00:34:39.800
Let's bring this
back to the book.

00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:41.020
GREG PROOPS: Your question
makes no sense at all.

00:34:41.020 --> 00:34:42.000
And I appreciate that.

00:34:45.780 --> 00:34:48.260
I did use a computer when
I was writing the book.

00:34:48.260 --> 00:34:50.360
But I didn't use Wikipedia
or anything like that.

00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:52.100
I used other books as resources.

00:34:52.100 --> 00:34:55.510
And I also went on websites
specific to the people

00:34:55.510 --> 00:34:58.010
that I was studying and not--

00:34:58.010 --> 00:35:00.470
Wikipedia, I find, is erroneous.

00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:01.350
How do I know so?

00:35:01.350 --> 00:35:04.830
Because I have a Wikipedia
page of my minor fame.

00:35:04.830 --> 00:35:08.740
And it has everything
wrong about me.

00:35:08.740 --> 00:35:11.666
And I had a web friend
who was a web expert.

00:35:11.666 --> 00:35:15.100
And I gave him an actual bio
that put all the facts straight

00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:15.600
on it.

00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:17.250
And he submitted
it to Wikipedia.

00:35:17.250 --> 00:35:20.390
And they rejected it and
gave it back and went, no, we

00:35:20.390 --> 00:35:21.320
don't want that bio.

00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:22.690
And I'm like, but I wrote it.

00:35:22.690 --> 00:35:24.090
It's my life, and I
know what happened.

00:35:24.090 --> 00:35:25.089
And they're like uh-huh.

00:35:25.089 --> 00:35:26.554
This is what happened.

00:35:26.554 --> 00:35:30.360
So that's why I
didn't use Wikipedia.

00:35:30.360 --> 00:35:31.680
I also have Gmail.

00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:35.500
If you wish to write me, it's
fanmailforgreg@gmail.com.

00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:38.710
And I ask everyone who
writes me on my Gmail

00:35:38.710 --> 00:35:41.330
to say hello to the
NSA because it's

00:35:41.330 --> 00:35:44.070
almost certain that the NSA
is collecting that data.

00:35:44.070 --> 00:35:46.470
And so people write very
funny things like, go

00:35:46.470 --> 00:35:47.940
fuck yourself and--

00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:50.330
AUDIENCE: Say NSA,
I fucked your mom.

00:35:50.330 --> 00:35:52.660
GREG PROOPS: Yeah,
exactly, like the NSA

00:35:52.660 --> 00:35:55.780
has a mom, which I love.

00:35:55.780 --> 00:35:58.140
But I think it's a very
useful tool, the search

00:35:58.140 --> 00:35:59.000
engine and whatnot.

00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:05.770
I also find books
are a dandy resource.

00:36:05.770 --> 00:36:11.250
And that people are
often a good resource.

00:36:11.250 --> 00:36:14.500
They're not a factual resource
because people say things like,

00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:16.100
I think I read this somewhere.

00:36:16.100 --> 00:36:18.304
Or, I might have
heard this somewhere.

00:36:18.304 --> 00:36:20.470
So that's why I wrote this
book, so that you can go,

00:36:20.470 --> 00:36:22.410
I've read it in
Greg Proops' book.

00:36:22.410 --> 00:36:25.420
And I say, you can say to
your friends, I read it here

00:36:25.420 --> 00:36:26.920
and it's on page
whatever, whatever.

00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:28.753
But I do appreciate
that there are engineers

00:36:28.753 --> 00:36:30.045
because I couldn't do your job.

00:36:30.045 --> 00:36:32.211
A lot of people go, how can
you be a stand-up comic?

00:36:32.211 --> 00:36:32.850
And it's easy.

00:36:32.850 --> 00:36:34.433
You just have to
have an unlimited ego

00:36:34.433 --> 00:36:36.745
and no sense of embarrassment.

00:36:36.745 --> 00:36:37.870
I could never get on stage.

00:36:37.870 --> 00:36:40.500
And I'm always like, good,
there's too many of us.

00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:42.024
Stay off the fucking stage.

00:36:42.024 --> 00:36:44.440
And I could never be an engineer
because I can never focus

00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:46.440
and I have no ability
at math whatsoever.

00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:50.290
And my ADD precludes sitting
in one place for a long time.

00:36:50.290 --> 00:36:54.480
I worked in a law office for
several years as a schmendrick.

00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:56.060
Thank you, for the
Jews in the house.

00:36:56.060 --> 00:37:00.070
And I didn't like it.

00:37:00.070 --> 00:37:00.950
This was in the '80s.

00:37:00.950 --> 00:37:02.283
And there was no computers then.

00:37:02.283 --> 00:37:05.710
There were word processors
and fax machines.

00:37:05.710 --> 00:37:07.920
And I used to make jewelery
out of paper clips.

00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:11.091
And I remember being so
bored and hateful at my job,

00:37:11.091 --> 00:37:13.090
at one point I laid on
the floor and pretended I

00:37:13.090 --> 00:37:17.290
was dead for maybe 45 minutes.

00:37:17.290 --> 00:37:19.857
And no one walked
into the cubicle.

00:37:19.857 --> 00:37:21.940
So it might have been the
saddest part of my life.

00:37:21.940 --> 00:37:24.110
I was like, I am
going to show them how

00:37:24.110 --> 00:37:25.620
this job is destroying my soul.

00:37:25.620 --> 00:37:28.780
And I laid on the floor,
and no one fucking came in.

00:37:28.780 --> 00:37:31.250
Finally, I got up off the
floor, dusted myself off,

00:37:31.250 --> 00:37:33.120
put my paper clip
jewelry on, and went back

00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:38.500
to my job of putting
toner in the copy machine.

00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:42.210
But I'm appreciative
that you've come out.

00:37:42.210 --> 00:37:43.903
Is everyone here an engineer?

00:37:43.903 --> 00:37:44.670
AUDIENCE: No.

00:37:44.670 --> 00:37:45.503
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:37:45.503 --> 00:37:48.536
AUDIENCE: Advertising
also, which is awesome.

00:37:48.536 --> 00:37:51.026
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:51.026 --> 00:37:53.020
AUDIENCE: No it's not.

00:37:53.020 --> 00:37:55.190
GREG PROOPS: I understand.

00:37:55.190 --> 00:37:56.780
I am, of course,
advertising my book,

00:37:56.780 --> 00:38:00.500
so I cannot gainsay you
in any way right now.

00:38:00.500 --> 00:38:04.400
And from the position I'm
standing in, selling my wares

00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:07.500
as it were, there's
no way I can diminish

00:38:07.500 --> 00:38:09.280
you working in advertising.

00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:12.870
Later, of course, on the
comedy club stage, yes.

00:38:12.870 --> 00:38:15.090
But here and now, not so much.

00:38:15.090 --> 00:38:17.040
Does that answer
your question at all?

00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:19.470
AUDIENCE: Yes, yes.

00:38:19.470 --> 00:38:21.130
GREG PROOPS: I own a computer.

00:38:21.130 --> 00:38:22.570
And I own a phone.

00:38:22.570 --> 00:38:23.600
So, you know, hey.

00:38:26.550 --> 00:38:29.120
I got Netflix and shit.

00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:30.580
I'm down with the kids.

00:38:30.580 --> 00:38:31.680
I'm learning.

00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:35.600
I don't know that I have
a favorite Google product.

00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:38.710
The word Google is
kind of exciting.

00:38:38.710 --> 00:38:42.480
It's an infinite thing,
Googleplex and all that.

00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:43.510
Thank you.

00:38:43.510 --> 00:38:46.050
What's your question, sir?

00:38:46.050 --> 00:38:48.580
AUDIENCE: My question
is that I've never

00:38:48.580 --> 00:38:51.842
seen comedians laugh to their
jokes, or even laugh at all.

00:38:51.842 --> 00:38:53.550
GREG PROOPS: I didn't
hear what you said.

00:38:53.550 --> 00:38:54.010
You didn't what?

00:38:54.010 --> 00:38:55.468
AUDIENCE: I've
never seen comedians

00:38:55.468 --> 00:38:57.270
laugh at all to their jokes.

00:38:57.270 --> 00:39:00.070
Or even when you laugh, like
[IMITATING GREG'S LAUGH] done,

00:39:00.070 --> 00:39:01.820
or [IMITATING GREG'S LAUGH]
done.

00:39:01.820 --> 00:39:04.070
And everybody else is laughing.

00:39:04.070 --> 00:39:05.030
How does that filter?

00:39:05.030 --> 00:39:08.772
Is there any joke in-- Is
that taught as to comedians?

00:39:08.772 --> 00:39:11.230
Is it like, hey, you're going
to be comedian-- never laugh?

00:39:11.230 --> 00:39:12.642
GREG PROOPS: Oh, no, I think--

00:39:12.642 --> 00:39:14.225
AUDIENCE: Are there
any jokes that you

00:39:14.225 --> 00:39:18.860
have really laughed and banged
your tummy on the floor?

00:39:18.860 --> 00:39:21.330
We would like to hear
about those jokes rather

00:39:21.330 --> 00:39:23.457
than those jokes which you
have made others laugh.

00:39:23.457 --> 00:39:25.290
What are the jokes that
have made you laugh?

00:39:25.290 --> 00:39:26.499
I have never seen you laugh.

00:39:26.499 --> 00:39:27.540
GREG PROOPS: We do laugh.

00:39:27.540 --> 00:39:28.280
We do laugh.

00:39:31.090 --> 00:39:32.590
I laugh at lots
of people's jokes.

00:39:32.590 --> 00:39:33.775
And my wife's very funny.

00:39:33.775 --> 00:39:36.690
And I laugh at lots
of comedians' jokes.

00:39:36.690 --> 00:39:38.850
But in general, no.

00:39:38.850 --> 00:39:41.604
The joke is about comedians.

00:39:41.604 --> 00:39:43.020
A comic could be
on stage killing,

00:39:43.020 --> 00:39:45.103
and the other comedians
turn to each other and go,

00:39:45.103 --> 00:39:47.500
that's funny.

00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:49.030
But you guys are engineers.

00:39:49.030 --> 00:39:51.500
When someone comes up with
a Leviathan calculation that

00:39:51.500 --> 00:39:53.510
solves some sort of
equation, does everyone

00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:55.840
gather around and fucking
do a lap of honor and shit?

00:39:55.840 --> 00:39:56.830
No.

00:39:56.830 --> 00:39:58.920
You just nod sagely
at one another and go,

00:39:58.920 --> 00:40:03.190
yes, you certainly
cracked that one open.

00:40:03.190 --> 00:40:05.430
So it's because we're in
the profession of laughter

00:40:05.430 --> 00:40:09.150
that we don't necessarily
get all giggly all the time.

00:40:09.150 --> 00:40:11.700
We're a little more
judicious and professional

00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:14.320
in assaying what the
other person has said.

00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:18.410
Having said that, I laugh
at lots of different jokes.

00:40:18.410 --> 00:40:21.430
And I have lots of
favorite comedians.

00:40:21.430 --> 00:40:23.930
I was quoting a Mark
Maron joke last night

00:40:23.930 --> 00:40:27.947
where he said-- we were
talking about the podcasting.

00:40:27.947 --> 00:40:30.030
And right now, we're able
to say whatever we want.

00:40:30.030 --> 00:40:31.665
But soon the
governmental will get hip

00:40:31.665 --> 00:40:33.540
to the fact that were
talking seditious smack

00:40:33.540 --> 00:40:35.300
and try to shut us down.

00:40:35.300 --> 00:40:38.840
Someone at the SEC will be
assigned to listen to podcasts.

00:40:38.840 --> 00:40:41.966
And they're going to
have an enormous job

00:40:41.966 --> 00:40:45.030
of sifting through Chris
Hardwick talking about

00:40:45.030 --> 00:40:47.400
"The Walking Dead"
for 1,000 years

00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:49.670
and finding what's
wrong with that.

00:40:49.670 --> 00:40:52.760
And Mark Maron's joke was, if
there is an FBI agent assigned

00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:55.800
to me, he's the saddest FBI
agent in the whole agency.

00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:58.750
Subject got up in the morning,
masturbated, and then cried

00:40:58.750 --> 00:40:59.740
for several hours.

00:40:59.740 --> 00:41:04.150
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:04.150 --> 00:41:06.410
[SNORT]

00:41:06.410 --> 00:41:07.910
Yes, I slapped my thigh as well.

00:41:07.910 --> 00:41:11.030
That was-- That one
really made me laugh

00:41:11.030 --> 00:41:13.490
when I heard it the first time.

00:41:13.490 --> 00:41:15.920
Bill Hicks always has
lots of jokes that

00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:17.440
really make me laugh out loud.

00:41:17.440 --> 00:41:18.360
What's that?

00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:21.770
One of my favorites is he
has these jokes about Jesus.

00:41:21.770 --> 00:41:23.740
He goes, you think
if Jesus came back,

00:41:23.740 --> 00:41:26.050
he'd really want to see
everyone wearing a crucifix?

00:41:26.050 --> 00:41:27.860
It'd be like walking around
with a gun around your neck

00:41:27.860 --> 00:41:29.651
and you see Jackie
Kennedy and you go, just

00:41:29.651 --> 00:41:31.580
thinking about John, right?

00:41:31.580 --> 00:41:36.410
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:36.410 --> 00:41:39.114
These are Bill Hicks'
jokes, not mine.

00:41:39.114 --> 00:41:40.155
And God bless Bill Hicks.

00:41:40.155 --> 00:41:43.360
He's gone now, but-- So he goes,
I'm doing these jokes one night

00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:46.200
and a bar in Texas and these
rednecks come up to me.

00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:47.730
And they go, hey, come here.

00:41:47.730 --> 00:41:48.640
Boom.

00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:50.910
And he goes, why do people
always push you away

00:41:50.910 --> 00:41:52.410
when they say come here?

00:41:52.410 --> 00:41:53.200
Hey, come here.

00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:53.800
Boom.

00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:54.970
We're Christians.

00:41:54.970 --> 00:41:57.600
And we didn't like what
you said about Jesus.

00:41:57.600 --> 00:41:59.190
And we're going
to kick your ass.

00:41:59.190 --> 00:42:03.840
And he goes, well, if you're
Christians, forgive me.

00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:06.070
And that joke, I thought,
was hysterically funny.

00:42:06.070 --> 00:42:11.850
That one made me laugh out loud
because it's a profound joke

00:42:11.850 --> 00:42:13.666
about Christianity.

00:42:13.666 --> 00:42:14.290
And what is it?

00:42:14.290 --> 00:42:16.450
The one about anti-abortionists?

00:42:16.450 --> 00:42:19.530
If you're so pro-life, why don't
you go all the way and lock

00:42:19.530 --> 00:42:21.140
arms around a cemetery?

00:42:21.140 --> 00:42:27.950
[LAUGHS] No one fucking
dies on our watch.

00:42:31.306 --> 00:42:32.749
[SNORT]

00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:37.610
George Carlin had one, too,
that made me cry laughing.

00:42:37.610 --> 00:42:39.277
He goes, what is
this with Dan Akroyd

00:42:39.277 --> 00:42:41.110
and all these middle-aged
white guys opening

00:42:41.110 --> 00:42:42.920
the House of Blues?

00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:45.720
He says, white people
have to understand.

00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:47.270
We're not here to
sing the blues.

00:42:47.270 --> 00:42:49.893
We're here to give
people the blues.

00:42:49.893 --> 00:42:56.210
[LAUGHS]

00:42:56.210 --> 00:42:58.820
So those are the kind of jokes.

00:42:58.820 --> 00:43:00.790
What was Lily Tomlin's one?

00:43:00.790 --> 00:43:04.440
Lily Tomlin said, when I was
young, I wanted to be somebody.

00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:06.393
Now I realize I should've
been more specific.

00:43:11.032 --> 00:43:12.410
[SNORT]

00:43:13.282 --> 00:43:16.180
I'm getting a lot of mileage
off other geniuses' jokes

00:43:16.180 --> 00:43:17.500
that aren't mine.

00:43:17.500 --> 00:43:21.200
This is fantastic, just
reciting shit I remembered.

00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:22.760
Thank you for your question.

00:43:22.760 --> 00:43:23.770
I appreciate it.

00:43:23.770 --> 00:43:25.030
Yes, sir?

00:43:25.030 --> 00:43:27.180
No women want to ask anything?

00:43:27.180 --> 00:43:27.680
All right.

00:43:27.680 --> 00:43:29.494
Whatever.

00:43:29.494 --> 00:43:30.470
Yes, sir?

00:43:30.470 --> 00:43:31.960
AUDIENCE: A technical question.

00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:36.985
When you're doing the song
improv, you get up there.

00:43:36.985 --> 00:43:37.990
And you get the topic.

00:43:37.990 --> 00:43:41.950
And you have 10 seconds to come
up with a verse that rhymes.

00:43:41.950 --> 00:43:42.944
Is there a technique?

00:43:42.944 --> 00:43:44.235
I just think that's impossible.

00:43:44.235 --> 00:43:45.510
I don't know how you do that.

00:43:45.510 --> 00:43:47.260
GREG PROOPS: Well,
it's not, because we've

00:43:47.260 --> 00:43:48.290
done it a long time.

00:43:51.142 --> 00:43:53.100
We've all worked together
for a thousand years.

00:43:53.100 --> 00:43:57.150
And your brain just
tries to click into gear.

00:43:57.150 --> 00:43:58.705
My friend Jeff
Davis always says,

00:43:58.705 --> 00:44:00.580
say the first thing that
comes into your mind

00:44:00.580 --> 00:44:02.730
because that's usually
the funniest thing.

00:44:02.730 --> 00:44:05.200
The rhyming part is a little
difficult occasionally.

00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:08.759
I mean, with Wayne Brady,
he's extraordinary.

00:44:08.759 --> 00:44:10.800
And he can make up anything
right then and there.

00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:12.080
He's not goofing around.

00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:13.390
And we don't edit it out.

00:44:13.390 --> 00:44:15.630
Like people go, oh you guys
couldn't possibly make it

00:44:15.630 --> 00:44:16.400
up the way you do.

00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:19.210
Not only do we do it, we
get four or five shows out

00:44:19.210 --> 00:44:20.410
of a two-hour taping.

00:44:20.410 --> 00:44:21.817
We play maybe 25 games.

00:44:21.817 --> 00:44:23.650
And then the rest of
it's camera in and out.

00:44:23.650 --> 00:44:24.210
That's all it is.

00:44:24.210 --> 00:44:25.220
So the editing, right?

00:44:25.220 --> 00:44:26.010
So that we can--

00:44:26.010 --> 00:44:27.330
The show is modular.

00:44:27.330 --> 00:44:29.730
So whatever bit we do,
whatever improv we do,

00:44:29.730 --> 00:44:32.690
can be put with whatever,
any bit from any other part

00:44:32.690 --> 00:44:33.830
of the show.

00:44:33.830 --> 00:44:36.310
So that you could put a whole
bunch of shows together.

00:44:36.310 --> 00:44:38.740
So there's always Aisha
going, when we come back,

00:44:38.740 --> 00:44:41.239
when we come back, this, now
there's this, now there's this.

00:44:41.239 --> 00:44:44.540
So that's how we make
the show, that format.

00:44:44.540 --> 00:44:47.790
So we spend more time getting up
and standing up and going back

00:44:47.790 --> 00:44:50.080
and sitting down than
we do improvising

00:44:50.080 --> 00:44:51.580
so that the show
can be put together

00:44:51.580 --> 00:44:53.960
in any particular order that
they need to put it together

00:44:53.960 --> 00:44:54.780
in.

00:44:54.780 --> 00:44:57.870
Having said, we rarely
throw anything away.

00:44:57.870 --> 00:45:00.130
Once in a while there's
a miscue or someone

00:45:00.130 --> 00:45:01.400
says fuck or something.

00:45:01.400 --> 00:45:02.770
And then they stop camera.

00:45:02.770 --> 00:45:04.610
And that's how, if I
can't think anything

00:45:04.610 --> 00:45:08.517
and we're doing a hoedown or one
of those awful fucking things--

00:45:08.517 --> 00:45:10.350
By the way, hoedowns
are our least favorite.

00:45:10.350 --> 00:45:11.880
And I'm not the only one.

00:45:11.880 --> 00:45:14.700
We were playing in Alberta,
Canadia, the other night.

00:45:14.700 --> 00:45:18.120
And someone yelled hoedown
out from the audience.

00:45:18.120 --> 00:45:21.590
And Ryan Stiles went, I got
your hoedown right here, right?

00:45:21.590 --> 00:45:25.770
Like, Ryan hates
the fucking hoedown.

00:45:25.770 --> 00:45:28.910
That's how-- if I can't think
of anything and I freak out

00:45:28.910 --> 00:45:30.430
and I don't have
a rhyme, I'll go,

00:45:30.430 --> 00:45:31.840
I fucking, fucking, fucking.

00:45:31.840 --> 00:45:34.439
And they go, cut.

00:45:34.439 --> 00:45:36.730
And then you get to go back
and go right, right, right.

00:45:36.730 --> 00:45:38.970
What rhymes with wedge?

00:45:38.970 --> 00:45:41.170
And then come back out
and give it another go.

00:45:41.170 --> 00:45:43.160
So we're doing it off
the top of our head.

00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:44.660
And we're doing it in real time.

00:45:44.660 --> 00:45:46.670
And nothing gets cut
out of the improvs

00:45:46.670 --> 00:45:48.070
and ends up on the floor.

00:45:48.070 --> 00:45:49.779
They are not cutting
the improvs together

00:45:49.779 --> 00:45:51.695
to make them look like
we're improvising them.

00:45:51.695 --> 00:45:53.590
We really are improvising
them all the time.

00:45:53.590 --> 00:45:54.715
And I'm not just saying it.

00:45:54.715 --> 00:45:56.370
We've been doing
it for 100 years.

00:45:56.370 --> 00:46:00.010
I've been on the show for--
We started 25 years ago

00:46:00.010 --> 00:46:01.230
when I was 11.

00:46:01.230 --> 00:46:04.270
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:04.270 --> 00:46:05.175
It's a science.

00:46:05.175 --> 00:46:06.050
You know what I mean?

00:46:06.050 --> 00:46:07.660
Our producer is a scientist.

00:46:07.660 --> 00:46:09.700
He's made the show
this modular thing

00:46:09.700 --> 00:46:12.160
that can be put in with
different building blocks.

00:46:12.160 --> 00:46:14.992
This, this, this.

00:46:14.992 --> 00:46:18.890
The reason why I think me
and Ryan and Colin and Wayne

00:46:18.890 --> 00:46:22.340
and Brad and whomever are
still on it after 25 years

00:46:22.340 --> 00:46:26.980
is that it's difficult to find
people who can play that way.

00:46:26.980 --> 00:46:30.820
Our producer's an extremely
nervous individual.

00:46:30.820 --> 00:46:33.240
And we add new people to
the cast every once a while.

00:46:33.240 --> 00:46:35.680
But you have to be
able to go like that.

00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:37.300
It's a shark tank.

00:46:37.300 --> 00:46:38.090
We're supportive.

00:46:38.090 --> 00:46:38.550
We're not mean.

00:46:38.550 --> 00:46:40.258
We don't cut each
other off at the knees.

00:46:40.258 --> 00:46:43.560
But we bounce pass backwards
with our eyes closed

00:46:43.560 --> 00:46:45.400
like the Lakers of the '80s.

00:46:45.400 --> 00:46:50.860
And the Lakers are a--
that's a sports team.

00:46:50.860 --> 00:46:57.287
Sports are-- Well, anyway,
so that's how that works.

00:46:57.287 --> 00:46:59.370
I don't know how I can
describe the mental process

00:46:59.370 --> 00:47:01.090
of being able to think
of a rhyme immediately.

00:47:01.090 --> 00:47:02.500
But I know when I'm
playing with Jeff on stage

00:47:02.500 --> 00:47:04.320
and we have to sing a song
together, and they go,

00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:05.610
oh, this was a country
western classic.

00:47:05.610 --> 00:47:06.776
And it's all about teachers.

00:47:06.776 --> 00:47:08.675
And it's called "I Love
You and Your Apple."

00:47:08.675 --> 00:47:10.800
And like he'll go to me,
just get out there and go,

00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:15.760
[SINGING] School, school,
taught me not to be a fool.

00:47:15.760 --> 00:47:16.260
Or whatever.

00:47:16.260 --> 00:47:17.301
You know, like that's it.

00:47:17.301 --> 00:47:19.614
You just jump right in and
then hopefully something

00:47:19.614 --> 00:47:21.780
happens in your mind and
you're able to think of it.

00:47:21.780 --> 00:47:24.950
And you have to be
confident freefalling.

00:47:24.950 --> 00:47:28.050
Keith Johnstone, who
is a guru of improv,

00:47:28.050 --> 00:47:31.410
said that improv is walking
backwards down the road

00:47:31.410 --> 00:47:33.830
because you only know
where you've been.

00:47:33.830 --> 00:47:35.430
So you're like
this all the time.

00:47:35.430 --> 00:47:38.050
I don't know where I'm going,
but I know where I've been.

00:47:38.050 --> 00:47:40.590
So that's how we
kind of approach it.

00:47:40.590 --> 00:47:45.332
And every scene in the
world is about status.

00:47:45.332 --> 00:47:47.790
So when you walk into a scene
and there's someone in there,

00:47:47.790 --> 00:47:48.790
are you a higher than them?

00:47:48.790 --> 00:47:49.760
Are you lower than them?

00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:50.520
Are you their mother?

00:47:50.520 --> 00:47:51.300
Are you their father?

00:47:51.300 --> 00:47:52.050
Are you their son?

00:47:52.050 --> 00:47:53.040
Are you their employee?

00:47:53.040 --> 00:47:54.280
Are you their--

00:47:54.280 --> 00:47:56.870
So that's how every
interaction works.

00:47:56.870 --> 00:47:58.420
And if you don't
think so, when you

00:47:58.420 --> 00:48:01.430
walk back to where you're
going to work today,

00:48:01.430 --> 00:48:04.120
the first person that you
meet, think about that.

00:48:04.120 --> 00:48:06.709
The first person you run into,
are you an equal with them?

00:48:06.709 --> 00:48:07.500
Are you above them?

00:48:07.500 --> 00:48:08.050
Are you below--

00:48:08.050 --> 00:48:08.925
You know what I mean?

00:48:08.925 --> 00:48:10.380
And I don't mean economically.

00:48:10.380 --> 00:48:15.050
I just mean socially,
like human-ly.

00:48:15.050 --> 00:48:17.610
If you walk by someone and
they're cleaning the floor,

00:48:17.610 --> 00:48:19.360
do you stop and help
them clean the floor?

00:48:19.360 --> 00:48:21.609
No, you fucking don't.

00:48:21.609 --> 00:48:22.650
Because that's their job.

00:48:22.650 --> 00:48:23.649
And dah-dah-dah-dah-dah.

00:48:23.649 --> 00:48:26.200
And if you walk by and your
boss walks by, do you go, hey,

00:48:26.200 --> 00:48:26.435
fuck you.

00:48:26.435 --> 00:48:27.059
I'm sick of it.

00:48:27.059 --> 00:48:27.947
No, you don't.

00:48:27.947 --> 00:48:29.030
Because they're your boss.

00:48:29.030 --> 00:48:31.075
You go, hi, good
morning, Mr. Gunderson.

00:48:31.075 --> 00:48:32.790
And what a lovely day today.

00:48:32.790 --> 00:48:35.420
And what a lovely corporate
mantel you're wearing,

00:48:35.420 --> 00:48:36.800
and shit like that.

00:48:36.800 --> 00:48:39.440
So I hope I haven't
told you too much.

00:48:39.440 --> 00:48:42.580
Talking about improv is like
watching hot dogs get made.

00:48:42.580 --> 00:48:44.720
It's icky.

00:48:44.720 --> 00:48:46.687
Thank you, sir.

00:48:46.687 --> 00:48:47.270
And that's it.

00:48:47.270 --> 00:48:47.910
AUDIENCE: Can I ask--

00:48:47.910 --> 00:48:48.870
GREG PROOPS: Not one woman?

00:48:48.870 --> 00:48:49.370
Oh, hi.

00:48:49.370 --> 00:48:49.890
You're back.

00:48:49.890 --> 00:48:50.270
AUDIENCE: I'm back.

00:48:50.270 --> 00:48:51.692
Do you have favorite
improv game?

00:48:51.692 --> 00:48:53.900
GREG PROOPS: Well, I like
the film and theater styles

00:48:53.900 --> 00:48:55.275
because you get
to change genres,

00:48:55.275 --> 00:48:57.021
But we don't do that
one much anymore.

00:48:57.021 --> 00:48:58.270
They tend to do a lot of that.

00:48:58.270 --> 00:49:00.090
We're still doing
weird newscasters.

00:49:00.090 --> 00:49:03.370
The one that makes me laugh
the hardest is the dating one.

00:49:03.370 --> 00:49:04.830
We're still doing
the dating one.

00:49:04.830 --> 00:49:08.290
And I'm always the woman.

00:49:08.290 --> 00:49:11.170
So I'm always like,
bachelor number two,

00:49:11.170 --> 00:49:14.470
if I was steamed broccoli, what
would you pour all over me?

00:49:14.470 --> 00:49:18.650
And like, we've been doing
this for fucking 25 years.

00:49:18.650 --> 00:49:20.750
And the audience cries
laughing every time.

00:49:20.750 --> 00:49:23.950
And you're like, surely
you've figured this one out.

00:49:23.950 --> 00:49:26.130
And then it'll be
like-- Colin'll be like,

00:49:26.130 --> 00:49:29.870
thinks he's inside a sandwich,
or whatever fucking nonsense

00:49:29.870 --> 00:49:32.656
they've come up.
[NONSENSE SOUNDS]

00:49:32.656 --> 00:49:34.280
And the place is
fucking falling apart.

00:49:34.280 --> 00:49:37.240
And I'm always like, Jesus
Christ, surely this joke's

00:49:37.240 --> 00:49:37.960
done.

00:49:37.960 --> 00:49:39.060
But it never is.

00:49:39.060 --> 00:49:42.139
So that's the
infinity of improv.

00:49:42.139 --> 00:49:43.680
AUDIENCE: You've
shamed me into this.

00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:44.846
GREG PROOPS: Hello, darling.

00:49:44.846 --> 00:49:45.940
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:49:45.940 --> 00:49:49.230
As a human and as
a person, I truly

00:49:49.230 --> 00:49:51.000
appreciate all your
comments on feminism.

00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:51.370
Thank you very much.

00:49:51.370 --> 00:49:52.530
GREG PROOPS: Thank you.

00:49:52.530 --> 00:49:54.970
AUDIENCE: But I'm wondering,
as you go out into the world

00:49:54.970 --> 00:49:56.470
and as you're meeting
so many people

00:49:56.470 --> 00:50:00.010
and doing things like
this, how does the feminism

00:50:00.010 --> 00:50:03.670
play in those jokes
and in the rooms?

00:50:03.670 --> 00:50:05.910
How does it play in person?

00:50:05.910 --> 00:50:07.980
GREG PROOPS: Better than
it always has, I think.

00:50:07.980 --> 00:50:10.620
People are more involved
now, more enlightened.

00:50:10.620 --> 00:50:15.120
And the guys that are resistant
to it and are upset by it

00:50:15.120 --> 00:50:17.030
tend to be a little
quieter now because they

00:50:17.030 --> 00:50:18.940
can catch the overwhelming
drift in the wind.

00:50:18.940 --> 00:50:21.200
Having said that,
I was in Boston

00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:24.470
several weeks ago, which is a
small inferior city near here.

00:50:27.880 --> 00:50:31.930
The Bostonians on the night we
did the podcast were lovely.

00:50:31.930 --> 00:50:34.730
I'd received more poetry books
than any gig I've ever done.

00:50:34.730 --> 00:50:36.690
I mean, a dozen poetry books.

00:50:36.690 --> 00:50:37.900
And no one would let me move.

00:50:37.900 --> 00:50:40.870
They surrounded me and were
pressing poetry books on me,

00:50:40.870 --> 00:50:41.476
and marijuana.

00:50:41.476 --> 00:50:42.350
And it was fantastic.

00:50:45.020 --> 00:50:46.580
Then the stand-up weekend came.

00:50:46.580 --> 00:50:48.830
And it was people who didn't
know why they were there.

00:50:48.830 --> 00:50:50.320
They didn't come to
see me in particular.

00:50:50.320 --> 00:50:51.720
They just came to see comedy.

00:50:51.720 --> 00:50:54.080
Or because they'd
run out of roofies,

00:50:54.080 --> 00:50:55.950
whatever the situation was.

00:50:55.950 --> 00:50:58.050
And so they were there.

00:50:58.050 --> 00:50:59.830
And a lot of couples,
you know, whatnot.

00:50:59.830 --> 00:51:05.110
And the guys of Boston tend
to be a little unevolved,

00:51:05.110 --> 00:51:06.340
if I can generalize.

00:51:06.340 --> 00:51:07.980
I'm not saying
everyone in Boston.

00:51:07.980 --> 00:51:09.800
Well, what about Harvard
and Cambridge and all that?

00:51:09.800 --> 00:51:12.258
No one who goes to Harvard in
Cambridge comes to this club.

00:51:12.258 --> 00:51:13.340
I assure you of that.

00:51:13.340 --> 00:51:17.870
And if they do, they're in
charge of lethargy at Harvard.

00:51:17.870 --> 00:51:21.830
Indifference, I
teach difference.

00:51:21.830 --> 00:51:24.720
So I was doing this bit about
the woman dreaming the universe

00:51:24.720 --> 00:51:27.030
into existence and all that.

00:51:27.030 --> 00:51:29.930
And I did a lengthy
bit about guys

00:51:29.930 --> 00:51:31.310
yelling at women from cars.

00:51:31.310 --> 00:51:32.807
And how every woman
in the world is

00:51:32.807 --> 00:51:34.390
familiar with the
experience of you're

00:51:34.390 --> 00:51:35.810
carrying your
laundry in a basket.

00:51:35.810 --> 00:51:37.810
And all you want to do
is get to the laundromat.

00:51:37.810 --> 00:51:39.886
And a truck pulls up
and a guy goes, nice ass

00:51:39.886 --> 00:51:41.410
[NONSENSE SOUNDS] and all that.

00:51:41.410 --> 00:51:45.990
And the guy in the back yells
out, what are you, a woman?

00:51:45.990 --> 00:51:46.940
That was his heckle.

00:51:46.940 --> 00:51:47.600
AUDIENCE: Nice.

00:51:47.600 --> 00:51:50.130
GREG PROOPS: And it was
like, wow, what are you?

00:51:50.130 --> 00:51:51.820
Unempathetic?

00:51:51.820 --> 00:51:53.750
I didn't even respond
to it because I've never

00:51:53.750 --> 00:51:56.810
heard anything--
I mean, I really

00:51:56.810 --> 00:51:59.870
expected to see a club in
his hand and a unibrow.

00:51:59.870 --> 00:52:01.100
You know what I mean?

00:52:01.100 --> 00:52:03.920
If that's your heckle,
what do you do at night?

00:52:03.920 --> 00:52:04.530
Oh, right.

00:52:04.530 --> 00:52:06.790
You draw bison on a wall
and reenact the hunt.

00:52:09.440 --> 00:52:11.590
So occasionally, I
do you run into it.

00:52:11.590 --> 00:52:15.420
Here's something along that line
that you may find interesting.

00:52:15.420 --> 00:52:17.854
And it'll be the first
thing in today's talk.

00:52:17.854 --> 00:52:18.770
I'm joking, of course.

00:52:21.800 --> 00:52:25.900
Talking about the dominant
paradigm of the United States

00:52:25.900 --> 00:52:28.800
and that the rich are
taking all the money

00:52:28.800 --> 00:52:32.850
and that billionaires or the
1%, and the 0.1% of the 1%,

00:52:32.850 --> 00:52:34.600
is taking all the money
and the rest of us

00:52:34.600 --> 00:52:36.470
will have to scrabble,
if I introduced that

00:52:36.470 --> 00:52:38.590
on television or in
a radio interview

00:52:38.590 --> 00:52:40.890
or in a print interview
five years ago,

00:52:40.890 --> 00:52:42.370
I would be contested on it.

00:52:42.370 --> 00:52:44.536
People would go, no, that's
not how the world works.

00:52:44.536 --> 00:52:46.549
And now no one ever does.

00:52:46.549 --> 00:52:48.090
And I think it's a
function of what's

00:52:48.090 --> 00:52:51.470
happened in the last eight
years, the end of the Cheney

00:52:51.470 --> 00:52:54.620
administration,
and what happened

00:52:54.620 --> 00:52:57.520
when Romney ran and Romney got
caught out saying, you know,

00:52:57.520 --> 00:53:01.140
there's people that think
they're entitled to food.

00:53:01.140 --> 00:53:03.390
That was a very big moment
in American society.

00:53:03.390 --> 00:53:05.860
And I think a lot of people--
like, for instance, you guys

00:53:05.860 --> 00:53:07.420
are New Yorkers.

00:53:07.420 --> 00:53:09.156
Hurricane Sandy
hit, and everyone

00:53:09.156 --> 00:53:11.030
in New York and New
Jersey came out and voted

00:53:11.030 --> 00:53:15.630
for Obama in that last election
because people recognized

00:53:15.630 --> 00:53:17.230
with Mitt Romney,
maybe he wasn't

00:53:17.230 --> 00:53:21.200
an innately evil individual, but
he was a billionaire defending

00:53:21.200 --> 00:53:23.329
the interests of billionaires.

00:53:23.329 --> 00:53:25.370
And they said to him,
well, what about the women?

00:53:25.370 --> 00:53:27.078
And he went, I got
binders full of women.

00:53:27.078 --> 00:53:28.870
That was exactly the
wrong thing to say.

00:53:28.870 --> 00:53:29.290
AUDIENCE: Absolutely.

00:53:29.290 --> 00:53:30.900
GREG PROOPS: To 50%
of the population,

00:53:30.900 --> 00:53:33.120
what do you mean
I'm in a binder?

00:53:33.120 --> 00:53:34.650
That's how you look at me?

00:53:34.650 --> 00:53:39.070
And so they give glimpses all
the time, the dominant class,

00:53:39.070 --> 00:53:40.360
of where they're coming from.

00:53:40.360 --> 00:53:42.480
And when they do, it
informs everybody.

00:53:42.480 --> 00:53:45.800
So gradually-- to answer your
question a long-winded way--

00:53:45.800 --> 00:53:47.420
I think it's eroding.

00:53:47.420 --> 00:53:49.810
And that yeah, there's lots
of unreconstructed guys

00:53:49.810 --> 00:53:50.700
who want hot chicks.

00:53:50.700 --> 00:53:52.477
And they want the
Swedish bikini team.

00:53:52.477 --> 00:53:53.810
And they want to watch football.

00:53:53.810 --> 00:53:54.950
And they don't care
that football's

00:53:54.950 --> 00:53:56.950
an unpolice group of
corporate zillionaires

00:53:56.950 --> 00:53:58.920
who got these big
behemoths out there beating

00:53:58.920 --> 00:54:01.390
each other to death and they
don't do anything for them

00:54:01.390 --> 00:54:03.380
to deal with sexual
assault and all that shit,

00:54:03.380 --> 00:54:06.179
and they can look the other
way because it's entertainment.

00:54:06.179 --> 00:54:07.720
So I hope that
answers your question.

00:54:07.720 --> 00:54:08.410
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:54:08.410 --> 00:54:10.785
GREG PROOPS: It's getting
better and better all the time.

00:54:10.785 --> 00:54:13.400
And the preponderance of
dominant female comedians

00:54:13.400 --> 00:54:15.830
is making the playing
field awesome.

00:54:15.830 --> 00:54:20.020
Now there's Amy Schumer and Amy
Poehler and everyone named Amy.

00:54:20.020 --> 00:54:25.120
And all my friends, Jen
Kirkman and Margaret Cho.

00:54:25.120 --> 00:54:27.750
It's just fantastic.

00:54:27.750 --> 00:54:34.790
When I first started, when
TV was powered by steam,

00:54:34.790 --> 00:54:37.650
there wasn't-- you'd go to do
a weekend at a club and it was

00:54:37.650 --> 00:54:41.670
sure to be you and two
other guys, always.

00:54:41.670 --> 00:54:43.830
And usually two
other white guys.

00:54:43.830 --> 00:54:45.620
And now it's not
always that way.

00:54:45.620 --> 00:54:48.790
You often find there's
as many women as men.

00:54:48.790 --> 00:54:53.690
Even "Whose Line," which
is the most recherche retro

00:54:53.690 --> 00:54:56.009
show in the world,
where four men pretend

00:54:56.009 --> 00:54:57.800
to be women with each
other because there's

00:54:57.800 --> 00:55:00.426
no women in the cast, they've
been putting more women in.

00:55:00.426 --> 00:55:02.800
And now sometimes there's an
equal number of black people

00:55:02.800 --> 00:55:04.770
and white people on the
show, and an equal number

00:55:04.770 --> 00:55:06.728
of men and women on the
show, which there never

00:55:06.728 --> 00:55:07.520
was on the old one.

00:55:07.520 --> 00:55:09.603
It was just white guys.

00:55:09.603 --> 00:55:11.410
And not even that many Jews.

00:55:11.410 --> 00:55:13.510
Let's be fucking honest.

00:55:13.510 --> 00:55:15.110
For a comedy show with no Jews?

00:55:15.110 --> 00:55:16.440
Wow.

00:55:16.440 --> 00:55:19.699
How did you even engineer that?

00:55:19.699 --> 00:55:21.240
So I hope that
answers your question.

00:55:21.240 --> 00:55:21.500
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:55:21.500 --> 00:55:21.999
Thank you.

00:55:21.999 --> 00:55:22.961
GREG PROOPS: Thank you.

00:55:22.961 --> 00:55:23.460
Hi, darling.

00:55:23.460 --> 00:55:24.275
What's your name?

00:55:24.275 --> 00:55:25.400
AUDIENCE: My name is Molly.

00:55:25.400 --> 00:55:26.358
GREG PROOPS: Hi, Molly.

00:55:26.358 --> 00:55:29.440
AUDIENCE: And I'm really
into your outspoken feminism

00:55:29.440 --> 00:55:29.980
as well.

00:55:29.980 --> 00:55:30.460
GREG PROOPS: Thank you.

00:55:30.460 --> 00:55:32.080
AUDIENCE: You're
clearly in improv.

00:55:32.080 --> 00:55:33.080
And I find this problem.

00:55:33.080 --> 00:55:34.250
I'm walking down the street.

00:55:34.250 --> 00:55:36.590
I walk past somebody and
they're like, damn, girl.

00:55:36.590 --> 00:55:40.810
And then 15 paces later, I'm
like, what should I say back?

00:55:40.810 --> 00:55:41.510
I'm too late.

00:55:41.510 --> 00:55:43.300
Do you have something
improv-style

00:55:43.300 --> 00:55:46.050
that I could just
have at the ready?

00:55:46.050 --> 00:55:47.190
Just to say to them--

00:55:47.190 --> 00:55:47.390
GREG PROOPS: Oh, I see.

00:55:47.390 --> 00:55:47.450
Oh, you mean--

00:55:47.450 --> 00:55:50.100
AUDIENCE: As they harass
me, I, afterwards, am like,

00:55:50.100 --> 00:55:51.630
what should I have said?

00:55:51.630 --> 00:55:54.180
How can I let them know
that it's unacceptable,

00:55:54.180 --> 00:55:54.960
inappropriate.

00:55:54.960 --> 00:55:56.040
I'm annoyed.

00:55:56.040 --> 00:55:58.030
And that they're
coming off like a fool.

00:55:58.030 --> 00:55:59.210
But it's always too late.

00:55:59.210 --> 00:56:01.740
And then I think of a
million things after.

00:56:01.740 --> 00:56:04.270
GREG PROOPS: What are the
things you think of after?

00:56:04.270 --> 00:56:07.060
AUDIENCE: I want to stop
them and be like, excuse me,

00:56:07.060 --> 00:56:07.920
what's your name?

00:56:07.920 --> 00:56:08.890
Does that work?

00:56:08.890 --> 00:56:09.840
Why did you do that?

00:56:09.840 --> 00:56:12.131
Was I doing something that
made you think that I wanted

00:56:12.131 --> 00:56:13.980
to hear what you thought?

00:56:13.980 --> 00:56:15.530
Even that's kind
of scary to do when

00:56:15.530 --> 00:56:18.537
you're like in this
not always warm city.

00:56:18.537 --> 00:56:20.870
You don't want to stop them
and engage them because what

00:56:20.870 --> 00:56:22.120
if they punch you in the face?

00:56:22.120 --> 00:56:24.036
GREG PROOPS: Well, that's
what my thought-- My

00:56:24.036 --> 00:56:25.400
first thought was that.

00:56:25.400 --> 00:56:27.360
It depends on who's
yelling it out.

00:56:27.360 --> 00:56:29.290
I would be leery of even
stopping and engaging

00:56:29.290 --> 00:56:30.120
with some of these.

00:56:30.120 --> 00:56:33.780
AUDIENCE: Usually large, older
men would be the demographic.

00:56:33.780 --> 00:56:35.136
GREG PROOPS: Sadly.

00:56:35.136 --> 00:56:36.760
My generation is
going to die off soon,

00:56:36.760 --> 00:56:40.130
and it's going to be so great.

00:56:40.130 --> 00:56:42.339
I can't wait for Dick Cheney's
generation to die off.

00:56:42.339 --> 00:56:44.171
And then when they die
off, it'll be better.

00:56:44.171 --> 00:56:46.320
But then when we die off,
it'll be even better.

00:56:46.320 --> 00:56:48.370
Because I really
believe young people

00:56:48.370 --> 00:56:51.900
are not going to care about gay
marriage or medical marijuana

00:56:51.900 --> 00:56:53.812
or abortion or any of that shit.

00:56:53.812 --> 00:56:55.270
That's all going
to be a non-issue,

00:56:55.270 --> 00:56:57.180
this big heel-dragging thing.

00:56:57.180 --> 00:56:59.915
The first thing I would yell
back at a guy is like, oh,

00:56:59.915 --> 00:57:01.040
I didn't know you were gay.

00:57:01.040 --> 00:57:03.504
And that's, of
course, homophobic.

00:57:03.504 --> 00:57:04.420
But then you can say--

00:57:04.420 --> 00:57:04.860
AUDIENCE: I know.

00:57:04.860 --> 00:57:06.193
I don't want to play that angle.

00:57:08.907 --> 00:57:10.990
GREG PROOPS: I was going
to yell something at you,

00:57:10.990 --> 00:57:14.770
but you're so inconceivably
ugly that my tongue was tied.

00:57:14.770 --> 00:57:17.500
Or you could yell
back at them, wow,

00:57:17.500 --> 00:57:19.610
that was like Oscar
Wildean in its wit.

00:57:19.610 --> 00:57:20.960
I defer to you, sir.

00:57:20.960 --> 00:57:25.480
Or you could stop and go, what
did you just yell, you warlock?

00:57:25.480 --> 00:57:27.050
How did you know
the incantation that

00:57:27.050 --> 00:57:29.300
opens up the pink and
perfect cave of mystery?

00:57:29.300 --> 00:57:34.030
[LAUGHTER]

00:57:34.787 --> 00:57:36.620
AUDIENCE: But none of
these are telling them

00:57:36.620 --> 00:57:38.172
that it's inappropriate.

00:57:38.172 --> 00:57:39.880
GREG PROOPS: Hey,
James Bond, where'd you

00:57:39.880 --> 00:57:40.796
get that savoir faire?

00:57:44.500 --> 00:57:46.590
Men really feel the
need to let women

00:57:46.590 --> 00:57:49.790
know that they think
they're hot or whatever.

00:57:49.790 --> 00:57:52.270
AUDIENCE: Sometimes I
think it's not even that.

00:57:52.270 --> 00:57:53.500
I'm in gym clothes.

00:57:53.500 --> 00:57:56.030
GREG PROOPS: Oh, it doesn't
matter what women are wearing.

00:57:56.030 --> 00:57:58.280
AUDIENCE: I don't even feel
like I'm looking this way.

00:57:58.280 --> 00:58:00.435
And I just want to go to
work and be left alone.

00:58:00.435 --> 00:58:02.560
GREG PROOPS: Well, I say
this onstage all the time.

00:58:02.560 --> 00:58:05.370
And I swear to God, men in
the audience are like, what?

00:58:05.370 --> 00:58:07.795
Half the audiences are
still at the point of, well,

00:58:07.795 --> 00:58:09.180
I don't know what you mean, man.

00:58:09.180 --> 00:58:11.400
Yeah, you fucking do.

00:58:11.400 --> 00:58:14.240
And I always say to men, never
mind your sister, your mother,

00:58:14.240 --> 00:58:16.672
your wife, your girlfriend,
your aunt, your grandmother--

00:58:16.672 --> 00:58:18.130
all the women in
your life that you

00:58:18.130 --> 00:58:19.670
should relate to that you love.

00:58:19.670 --> 00:58:20.710
How about you?

00:58:20.710 --> 00:58:21.320
How about you?

00:58:21.320 --> 00:58:24.980
Ever thought of yourself
in another person's place?

00:58:24.980 --> 00:58:26.536
Empathy?

00:58:26.536 --> 00:58:29.160
If you were a woman and you knew
this was happening constantly?

00:58:29.160 --> 00:58:31.340
And now we have
incontrovertible evidence

00:58:31.340 --> 00:58:32.790
that it is happening
all the time,

00:58:32.790 --> 00:58:34.790
that maybe you might
reconsider yelling out?

00:58:34.790 --> 00:58:36.090
And then maybe if
you're with other guys

00:58:36.090 --> 00:58:38.430
that yell out and act like that,
maybe you might remonstrate

00:58:38.430 --> 00:58:40.030
with them and say,
hey dude, you're

00:58:40.030 --> 00:58:43.126
being a major douche wad?

00:58:43.126 --> 00:58:45.000
Yeah, it doesn't matter
what women look like.

00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:46.520
And it doesn't matter
what they're wearing.

00:58:46.520 --> 00:58:47.690
They get the same thing.

00:58:47.690 --> 00:58:49.910
You could be wearing
sweatpants and a-- That's

00:58:49.910 --> 00:58:51.130
my joke with the laundry.

00:58:51.130 --> 00:58:53.230
You're wearing sweatpants and
you have a do-rag on your head

00:58:53.230 --> 00:58:54.771
because you haven't
washed your hair.

00:58:54.771 --> 00:58:59.130
And that's when someone yells
out [NONSENSE SOUNDS] Believe

00:58:59.130 --> 00:59:00.860
me, women get it all the time.

00:59:00.860 --> 00:59:03.080
Well, I hope those
suggestions helped you at all.

00:59:03.080 --> 00:59:03.600
AUDIENCE: I loved them, yeah.

00:59:03.600 --> 00:59:04.310
GREG PROOPS: The other
thing you could do

00:59:04.310 --> 00:59:06.985
is go (IMITATING DEAF PERSON)
I didn't hear what you said.

00:59:06.985 --> 00:59:09.677
AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:59:09.677 --> 00:59:10.260
I'm not ready.

00:59:10.260 --> 00:59:11.190
I'm not ready for that.

00:59:11.190 --> 00:59:11.575
GREG PROOPS:
(IMITATING DEAF PERSON)

00:59:11.575 --> 00:59:13.050
Please repeat what you said.

00:59:13.050 --> 00:59:16.372
I didn't hear it.

00:59:16.372 --> 00:59:20.050
(IN REGULAR VOICE)
Oh, look what I found.

00:59:20.050 --> 00:59:20.715
It's for you.

00:59:23.240 --> 00:59:26.070
Or, is your voice so loud
because your dick is so small?

00:59:28.848 --> 00:59:31.871
That's the one.

00:59:31.871 --> 00:59:33.120
I think we're about done here.

00:59:33.120 --> 00:59:34.160
We've gone to 2:07.

00:59:34.160 --> 00:59:34.730
And I think we're
going to do books.

00:59:34.730 --> 00:59:35.690
Is that what we're doing now?

00:59:35.690 --> 00:59:36.370
Signing books?

00:59:36.370 --> 00:59:37.000
MALE SPEAKER: Yep.

00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:38.220
GREG PROOPS: Well, if
anyone wants to buy a book,

00:59:38.220 --> 00:59:38.920
I thank you.

00:59:38.920 --> 00:59:41.170
In any case, I thank you all
very much for coming out.

00:59:41.170 --> 00:59:42.800
I think for spending the
time, except for the girl

00:59:42.800 --> 00:59:43.940
who split halfway through.

00:59:43.940 --> 00:59:47.800
And I thank you for coming
out and watching me.

00:59:47.800 --> 00:59:49.510
I really do appreciate
your attention.

00:59:49.510 --> 00:59:50.770
And I'm sure this
is being broadcast

00:59:50.770 --> 00:59:51.880
all over the infinite universe.

00:59:51.880 --> 00:59:53.588
And everyone's going
to be like, I didn't

00:59:53.588 --> 00:59:55.976
realize he was that profane.

00:59:55.976 --> 00:59:57.850
But in any case, if you
want to buy the book,

00:59:57.850 --> 00:59:58.500
I'll be over there sitting.

00:59:58.500 --> 00:59:59.770
And I'm happy to take
a picture with you

00:59:59.770 --> 01:00:01.540
and sign it for you
and all that jazz.

01:00:01.540 --> 01:00:02.810
And thank you very
much for your time.

01:00:02.810 --> 01:00:03.560
I appreciate it.

01:00:03.560 --> 01:00:07.210
