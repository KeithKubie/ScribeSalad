00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.560
We know the US is running
a relatively large trade

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:06.230
deficit relative
to China in 2009.

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:13.490
We imported $260 billion more
than we exported to China.

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:15.460
And we know from
the last few videos

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:18.390
that the way that China
is keeping their currency

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.860
from appreciating because
of this trade imbalance

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:23.890
is that they're going out
there, printing money, and using

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:27.610
that yuan to buy dollar assets.

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:31.520
And we see over here
in 2006, 2007, 2008,

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.260
major increases in US assets.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.060
But what's a little
bit more interesting

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.200
is that, in 2009, we didn't
have a huge increase.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.170
It's pretty large by any
standard, but not large enough

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.750
to offset the actual
trade imbalance.

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.000
So how did China keep
its currency peg?

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Even better, let's actually look
at-- because this isn't just

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.320
the Chinese government.

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:56.720
These are just ownership of US
assets by Chinese nationals.

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.840
But we can actually look at
the major foreign holders

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.100
of treasury securities.

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.879
This actually comes from
the Treasury's own website.

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:08.560
And it tells us how much
different central banks,

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.830
how many the treasury securities
they are actually holding.

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.370
And you can see China
is the biggest holder.

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:21.850
If you go to November of
2009, it has $929 billion.

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:23.330
This is the People's
Bank of China.

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:29.080
It has $929 billion
worth of US treasuries.

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.450
But what's interesting here,
it is the largest holder,

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.900
but as we go from November
of 2009 to November of 2010

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.300
their holdings
actually went down.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:39.280
Not by a ton.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.300
They're still right
around $900 billion.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.000
But they went down.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.840
So given the fact that we
have this trade deficit, given

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.242
the fact that they want
to peg their currency,

00:01:48.242 --> 00:01:49.950
and that they want to
print money, and go

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.700
buy other people's assets,
how did this happen?

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.050
How did the number of
treasuries actually go down?

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:00.420
And actually how were they able
to reduce the amount of all US

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.040
assets that they bought?

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.150
Now, the treasury
answer is they don't

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:06.570
have to just buy treasuries.

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.470
They could by other US
assets, but even over here we

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.980
saw that they didn't buy
a ton of other US assets.

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.170
And a clue to what's
happening here,

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.790
and this isn't exactly
what's necessarily happening,

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.460
it's far more complicated than
I could explain in one video,

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.930
is that we do see other
countries whose US Treasury

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.550
holdings are
increasing dramatically

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.630
over the course of 2010.

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.850
In particular, you see
the United Kingdom.

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.930
Their holdings have grown from
$155 billion to $500 billion

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.800
over the course of 2010.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:39.675
And this is relative.

00:02:39.675 --> 00:02:43.390
The United Kingdom does not have
a significant trade imbalance

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.550
one way or the other
with the United States.

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:49.830
And we actually see we actually
see that it's currency really

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.520
didn't change much over
the course of 2010.

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.920
It's been about the same.

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.750
And this looks more
dramatic than it really is.

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.430
So the answer, and it could
be much more complicated

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.770
than this, is that China has
decided to somewhat diversify

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:07.950
from buying US treasuries,
and in particular US assets.

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.960
And maybe they're diversifying
to the pound sterling,

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.970
maybe they're
diversifying to the Euro.

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:17.890
And so they will start
buying, say, British assets.

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:19.860
But the British don't
want their currency

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.750
to appreciate too much
because then they'll

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.890
suffer trade consequences.

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:25.730
Their goods will
be too expensive.

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.550
And so the British
Central Bank would then

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:29.990
want to maybe, so that
their currency does not

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:31.810
appreciate relative
to the dollar,

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.034
they'll want to go and
buy American assets.

00:03:35.034 --> 00:03:37.200
And that's what it looks
like is actually happening.

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.370
And maybe one other small point
is that the Chinese government

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.960
has slowly allowed its
currency to appreciate.

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:46.534
But the appreciation
isn't as dramatic

00:03:46.534 --> 00:03:47.700
as this chart makes it look.

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:53.970
This is 6.8 yuan to the dollar
at the beginning of 2010

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:55.787
to about 6.6.

00:03:55.787 --> 00:03:57.370
And we're not getting
close to 0 here.

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.610
This is just from 6.8 to 6.6.

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:01.110
But over the last
several years they

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:04.090
have slowly been allowing
their currency to appreciate.

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.150
But what's really happening is
that they're diversifying away

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:08.734
from dollar assets.

00:04:08.734 --> 00:04:10.400
But when they buy
those other currencies

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.858
those people are going to want
to buy dollar assets to keep

00:04:12.858 --> 00:04:15.910
their currency from
moving too much.
