00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.623
So here is your solution. Take a second to
look at the placement of each name, and

00:00:05.635 --> 00:00:11.486
recall how this diagram actually works.
Any circle that's contained within another

00:00:11.498 --> 00:00:17.240
circle is a subset of that larger set. For
example, natural numbers are a subset of

00:00:17.252 --> 00:00:22.741
the whole numbers. This means that if a
number belongs in a certain category it

00:00:22.753 --> 00:00:27.964
also belongs in every category that
surrounds that circle. So all natural

00:00:27.976 --> 00:00:33.711
numbers are whole numbers, and integers,
and rational numbers, and real numbers.
