00:00:00.818 --> 00:00:02.873
Voiceover: What I want to
do in this video is try

00:00:02.873 --> 00:00:04.781
to give a reasonable understanding

00:00:04.781 --> 00:00:08.947
of the different players
involved that issue and process

00:00:08.947 --> 00:00:10.537
your credit cards.

00:00:10.537 --> 00:00:13.835
Let's start off with the processors.

00:00:16.003 --> 00:00:18.089
Sometimes you could say that the network,

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:20.089
or the processors are
the people that maintain

00:00:20.089 --> 00:00:22.089
the credit card networks.

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:29.453
Examples of those are Visa, Mastercard,

00:00:29.453 --> 00:00:33.188
American Express, Discover.

00:00:33.188 --> 00:00:36.388
What they do is they,
essentially, maintain networks

00:00:36.388 --> 00:00:38.930
of IT and policies that connect

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:40.187
a bunch of banks together.

00:00:40.187 --> 00:00:43.470
For just the sake of this
video, we'll do very simple.

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:48.836
Let's say that this is
network 1, maybe that's Visa.

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:51.125
Maybe this right here is network 2.

00:00:51.125 --> 00:00:53.959
This right here could be Mastercard.

00:00:56.136 --> 00:00:57.926
Right now the networks are
just circles, but you'll see

00:00:57.926 --> 00:01:01.658
that they're networks as I
build out this explanation.

00:01:01.658 --> 00:01:04.977
Let's say that I'm some bank out there.

00:01:05.191 --> 00:01:08.730
Let me call myself bank A.

00:01:10.856 --> 00:01:12.792
I decide that, you know
what, it would be good

00:01:12.792 --> 00:01:15.393
for my business for me
to issue a credit card.

00:01:15.393 --> 00:01:18.124
I could extend credit to my customers,

00:01:18.124 --> 00:01:20.262
they'll pay me interest,
maybe I'll make some fees

00:01:20.262 --> 00:01:23.524
off of that, and it'll be
good business for my bank.

00:01:23.524 --> 00:01:26.389
I go up to Visa and I say,
"Hey, can I be a member

00:01:26.389 --> 00:01:27.427
"of your network?"

00:01:27.427 --> 00:01:30.455
Visa has some policies and
if you're a legitimate bank

00:01:30.455 --> 00:01:31.792
and you agree to all those policies,

00:01:31.792 --> 00:01:34.858
you'll become a member of that network.

00:01:34.858 --> 00:01:36.762
I've joined the network
and I'm, of course,

00:01:36.762 --> 00:01:38.347
not the only person on that network.

00:01:38.347 --> 00:01:41.057
There's tons of other
banks on that network.

00:01:41.057 --> 00:01:45.261
That could be bank B,
this could be bank C,

00:01:45.261 --> 00:01:47.845
this could be bank D.

00:01:47.845 --> 00:01:50.124
Of course, each of these are
networks, so they all have

00:01:50.124 --> 00:01:52.259
their own member banks on them.

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.225
That's Mastercard's network right there.

00:01:57.333 --> 00:02:01.192
In this situation, let's say
I'm a customer of bank A.

00:02:01.192 --> 00:02:02.737
They say, "You want a credit
card?" and I say, "Sure.

00:02:02.737 --> 00:02:05.405
"That'll be convenient, I
don't like carrying cash

00:02:05.405 --> 00:02:07.572
"in my pocket, so give me a credit card."

00:02:07.572 --> 00:02:11.822
They'll issue a credit card
that looks something like this.

00:02:11.822 --> 00:02:15.259
The credit card, I think
we've all seen credit cards,

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:18.892
It'll say Bank A really big up at the top.

00:02:18.904 --> 00:02:23.459
Bank A, I'll have a credit
card number that's unique

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.327
to me, my credit card number,
my name will be there,

00:02:27.327 --> 00:02:30.655
some type of expiration
date, and then here

00:02:30.655 --> 00:02:32.926
in the bottom right corner,
they're going to say

00:02:32.926 --> 00:02:34.657
what network I'm a part of.

00:02:34.657 --> 00:02:37.453
In this case, it would be Visa.

00:02:37.527 --> 00:02:39.989
A credit card issued over
here would say Mastercard

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:41.260
or if it was American Express, they'd put

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.194
American Express here, or
maybe there's some type

00:02:43.194 --> 00:02:44.822
of a hologram.

00:02:44.822 --> 00:02:46.822
Great, I have a credit card here.

00:02:46.822 --> 00:02:48.155
I think we all have a general sense.

00:02:48.155 --> 00:02:50.925
I could use it and then
I'll build a balance

00:02:50.925 --> 00:02:53.074
and then in the future I
could pay off that balance

00:02:53.074 --> 00:02:55.993
to this bank or I could carry a balance

00:02:55.993 --> 00:02:58.089
and they'll charge me
interest, which is usually

00:02:58.089 --> 00:02:59.821
reasonably high interest,
so I want to pay it off

00:02:59.821 --> 00:03:02.259
fairly quickly, but how
does this actually work

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:04.905
in the context of a network?

00:03:04.905 --> 00:03:08.158
Let's say I go to the local grocery store.

00:03:08.194 --> 00:03:10.322
Let me draw that in orange.

00:03:10.322 --> 00:03:13.404
Let's say I go to some
grocery store over here.

00:03:13.404 --> 00:03:15.573
I'll say G for grocery.

00:03:15.573 --> 00:03:17.927
I buy $100 worth of
groceries and I want to pay

00:03:17.927 --> 00:03:20.738
with my newly issued credit card.

00:03:20.738 --> 00:03:21.489
Let me write this down.

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:23.994
This is the issuing, issuer.

00:03:23.994 --> 00:03:25.738
This is the issuing bank.

00:03:25.738 --> 00:03:27.593
I go to the grocery store,
I say, "Hey, I'd like to pay

00:03:27.593 --> 00:03:29.259
"with a credit card."

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:31.327
The grocery store, if
they accept credit cards,

00:03:31.327 --> 00:03:34.904
they need to have some
relationship with another bank

00:03:34.904 --> 00:03:37.260
someplace on this Visa
network, in order for them

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.403
to accept a Visa card.

00:03:39.403 --> 00:03:42.738
Let's say that they have
a relationship with bank B

00:03:42.738 --> 00:03:43.987
over here.

00:03:43.987 --> 00:03:46.407
This would be the merchant
bank, or we could say

00:03:46.407 --> 00:03:50.064
the retailer's bank, or it's
often in credit card lingo called

00:03:50.064 --> 00:03:52.898
the acquiring bank or the acquirer.

00:03:52.898 --> 00:03:55.192
You might wonder why is
it called the acquirer?

00:03:55.192 --> 00:03:57.067
It's called the acquirer
because this is the player

00:03:57.067 --> 00:03:59.594
that goes out and goes
to each of the merchants

00:03:59.594 --> 00:04:02.065
and says, "Hey, right
now you only accept cash

00:04:02.065 --> 00:04:04.069
"or you only accept American Express.

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:06.067
"Wouldn't it be great if
you also accepted Visa

00:04:06.067 --> 00:04:07.399
"or Mastercard?

00:04:07.399 --> 00:04:10.397
"That way you'll have more
appeal to more customers

00:04:10.397 --> 00:04:13.258
"and it'll be more
convenient for your customers

00:04:13.258 --> 00:04:15.147
"and every time a transaction
happens, we'll just take

00:04:15.147 --> 00:04:17.650
"a little bit of a cut
of that transaction."

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:20.402
So they go out and acquire
different retailers.

00:04:20.402 --> 00:04:23.660
This was the grocer, maybe bank B goes off

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:28.129
and acquires the shoemaker, maybe he goes

00:04:28.129 --> 00:04:31.727
and he gets the tailor on the network.

00:04:31.727 --> 00:04:33.261
These are all different
retailers who will now,

00:04:33.261 --> 00:04:34.925
all of a sudden, accept Visa,

00:04:34.925 --> 00:04:39.509
because their merchant bank is a member

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:40.511
of the Visa network.

00:04:40.511 --> 00:04:41.527
Likewise, it could've been a member

00:04:41.527 --> 00:04:43.526
of the Mastercard network,
it doesn't matter.

00:04:43.526 --> 00:04:46.785
This is the processor and
this is their network.

00:04:46.785 --> 00:04:51.985
Now, this guy, in this
context, he would accept Visa.

00:04:51.985 --> 00:04:54.388
I would give him my Visa
card and the first process

00:04:54.388 --> 00:04:57.099
is called authorization.

00:05:01.998 --> 00:05:04.852
That's literally to check
whether I'm good for the money,

00:05:04.852 --> 00:05:08.451
whether this card is
valid to buy $100 worth

00:05:08.451 --> 00:05:10.118
of groceries.

00:05:10.118 --> 00:05:12.491
When I swipe the card or
when the grocer swipes

00:05:12.491 --> 00:05:14.852
the card, it's going to send a message

00:05:14.852 --> 00:05:17.919
from that little unit, from
the point of sale unit,

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:20.319
to the acquiring bank.

00:05:20.319 --> 00:05:22.719
That's going to be forwarded to Visa.

00:05:22.719 --> 00:05:24.941
Then Visa will say, "Oh,
that's bank A's card,"

00:05:24.941 --> 00:05:26.941
and they'll give a number to bank A

00:05:26.941 --> 00:05:29.691
on their own proprietary network.

00:05:29.691 --> 00:05:31.523
Then bank A will look into
their database and say,

00:05:31.523 --> 00:05:34.607
"Oh yeah, Sal's got $1,000
of credit, he hasn't used

00:05:34.607 --> 00:05:36.025
"any of it, he is good for it.

00:05:36.025 --> 00:05:37.718
"I authorize the transaction."

00:05:37.718 --> 00:05:40.025
That message goes back through the network

00:05:40.025 --> 00:05:43.394
to bank B, so then we get authorized.

00:05:43.394 --> 00:05:46.227
Then the transaction goes
forward and eventually,

00:05:46.227 --> 00:05:49.649
as you could imagine,
you can't just authorize

00:05:49.649 --> 00:05:54.556
a transaction and then I
walk away with the groceries.

00:05:54.645 --> 00:05:57.115
At some point, this guy here expects

00:05:57.115 --> 00:06:00.849
to get his money back for
giving me the groceries.

00:06:00.849 --> 00:06:03.144
He expects to get $100 back.

00:06:03.144 --> 00:06:07.316
That $100 is going to come from bank A,

00:06:07.316 --> 00:06:09.393
but he's not going to get a complete $100,

00:06:09.393 --> 00:06:11.984
because obviously, each of these players,

00:06:11.984 --> 00:06:13.726
they're providing a service.

00:06:13.726 --> 00:06:15.894
This guy, he's plugged into the network

00:06:15.894 --> 00:06:18.643
and he's offering credit.

00:06:22.859 --> 00:06:25.342
The network operator or
the processor is offering

00:06:25.342 --> 00:06:29.989
their network and there's other services

00:06:29.989 --> 00:06:32.125
they might provide, different
security mechanisms.

00:06:32.125 --> 00:06:35.061
They say, "Sal lives in
Chicago, but all of a sudden,

00:06:35.061 --> 00:06:41.335
"he's buying $100 worth
of groceries in Salzburg

00:06:41.335 --> 00:06:45.057
"or someplace that seems unlikely."

00:06:45.057 --> 00:06:46.592
Then it might send some
type of a warning trigger,

00:06:46.592 --> 00:06:48.754
so people might have their
own security mechanisms.

00:06:48.754 --> 00:06:50.792
They're all providing a service.

00:06:50.792 --> 00:06:53.060
This guy is going out
there, he might be providing

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:55.919
the actual point of sale
terminals, the actual network,

00:06:55.919 --> 00:06:59.737
so they're all going to get a
little bit of a cut of things.

00:06:59.737 --> 00:07:04.371
Out of the $100, I got
$100 worth of groceries.

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:12.188
There'll be a 2%, and it's not always 2%,

00:07:12.188 --> 00:07:16.417
that's a round number,
but it also is a ballpark,

00:07:16.417 --> 00:07:19.405
not completely outlandish,
relative to what tends

00:07:19.405 --> 00:07:20.856
to be the case.

00:07:20.856 --> 00:07:26.253
Of that $100 that this guy could've gotten

00:07:26.253 --> 00:07:29.818
for his groceries, he has to pay a 2% ...

00:07:31.429 --> 00:07:32.349
Yeah, let's write it that way.

00:07:32.349 --> 00:07:34.847
He's got to pay a 2%, or in this case $2,

00:07:34.847 --> 00:07:36.791
that's 2% of $100.

00:07:36.791 --> 00:07:51.219
He's got to pay a $2 discount
rate to his acquiring bank.

00:07:53.337 --> 00:07:55.089
You might say, "Gee, the
acquirer, that's great.

00:07:55.089 --> 00:07:59.335
"They get 2% of all of
these guys' transactions,"

00:07:59.335 --> 00:08:00.455
but of course they're
going to have to share it

00:08:00.455 --> 00:08:03.417
with these other people up here.

00:08:03.417 --> 00:08:07.587
Actually, the bulk of
it ends up with bank A.

00:08:07.587 --> 00:08:11.335
Of this $2, and I'm doing
it in roundabout numbers,

00:08:11.335 --> 00:08:14.669
bank A, now we're going
to split up the $2,

00:08:14.669 --> 00:08:18.678
bank A is going to get,
let's just say, $1.70.

00:08:18.678 --> 00:08:20.751
These aren't that far off
from what the real numbers

00:08:20.751 --> 00:08:22.919
might be and they change
and they depend on the banks

00:08:22.919 --> 00:08:24.391
and the network and all of that.

00:08:24.391 --> 00:08:26.457
The networks might change their rates.

00:08:26.457 --> 00:08:31.189
$1.70 goes to bank A.

00:08:31.189 --> 00:08:34.420
The issuing bank, besides now that I have

00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:36.335
a credit balance, it'll be
able to charge interest on it.

00:08:36.335 --> 00:08:40.131
It also got $1.70 for that transaction.

00:08:40.131 --> 00:08:44.821
That $1.70 of the $2, this
is called an interchange fee.

00:08:44.925 --> 00:08:48.154
This right here is an interchange fee.

00:08:50.537 --> 00:08:54.288
It generally gets set by
the individual networks.

00:08:54.288 --> 00:08:56.803
Although, the networks don't
share that interchange fee.

00:08:56.803 --> 00:08:58.956
They just say, "Our standard
interchange fee is X%

00:08:58.956 --> 00:09:02.801
"of transactions plus $0.10,"
and that's what bank B

00:09:02.801 --> 00:09:04.467
is going to pay to bank A.

00:09:04.467 --> 00:09:07.214
It's essentially bank A's
cut of the discount rate,

00:09:07.214 --> 00:09:10.629
of the $2 this guy is charging that guy.

00:09:10.629 --> 00:09:13.047
Then, the network, they make their money

00:09:13.047 --> 00:09:15.046
in several ways, but in
general, they make money

00:09:15.046 --> 00:09:16.848
off of every transaction, as well.

00:09:16.848 --> 00:09:20.046
In this situation, they
make roughly about 1000th

00:09:20.046 --> 00:09:22.714
of the transaction or .1%

00:09:22.714 --> 00:09:26.447
In this example, $0.10
of this discount rate

00:09:26.447 --> 00:09:32.516
that this guy charged
would go to the processor

00:09:34.916 --> 00:09:36.582
or the network.

00:09:36.582 --> 00:09:38.519
Every time you transact,
the processor gets

00:09:38.519 --> 00:09:41.649
a small fraction of your actual purchase.

00:09:41.649 --> 00:09:44.527
Then, this guy will be left with 30 -

00:09:44.527 --> 00:09:45.157
Well, let's see.

00:09:45.157 --> 00:09:46.940
$1.70, $0.10, $1.80.

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:48.938
We're coming from $2, this
guy's going to be left

00:09:48.938 --> 00:09:50.461
with $0.20.

00:09:50.461 --> 00:09:52.327
When the whole transaction gets settled,

00:09:52.327 --> 00:09:54.190
which essentially means
everyone gets the money

00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:58.595
they need to get, this bank
is going to send Visa's

00:09:58.595 --> 00:10:01.940
settlement bank $100 minus the $1.70

00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:04.938
that it gets to keep as
part of its interchange fee.

00:10:04.938 --> 00:10:07.794
It's going to send Visa, what is that,

00:10:07.794 --> 00:10:14.023
that's $98.30 to Visa.

00:10:14.023 --> 00:10:17.605
Visa will keep $0.10 of it,
send it to the acquirer,

00:10:17.605 --> 00:10:23.823
so the acquirer is going to get $98.20.

00:10:23.994 --> 00:10:25.856
Then the acquirer is going
to keep $0.20 for itself

00:10:25.856 --> 00:10:30.991
and give the retailer $98.

00:10:30.991 --> 00:10:32.460
My numbers aren't exact,
but I want to give you

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:35.644
the general idea of how all this works.

00:10:35.994 --> 00:10:37.538
In order for this retailer
to be able to use all

00:10:37.538 --> 00:10:40.759
of this infrastructure out
there, he essentially had to pay

00:10:40.759 --> 00:10:43.008
2% of the actual transaction.

00:10:43.008 --> 00:10:44.935
That's always not going
to be 2%, but it gives you

00:10:44.935 --> 00:10:46.760
a nice, round figure.

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:49.204
This guy benefits because
he gets access to a network,

00:10:49.204 --> 00:10:51.427
it's convenient for the customers.

00:10:51.427 --> 00:10:53.604
This guy, obviously, is
getting some type of fee.

00:10:53.604 --> 00:10:56.534
The more retailers he signs
on, or the more retailers

00:10:56.534 --> 00:10:59.270
he acquires, the more cuts of transactions

00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:00.468
he's going to make.

00:11:00.468 --> 00:11:04.203
Visa makes a small cut on
many, many transactions,

00:11:04.203 --> 00:11:05.534
so that's where they make their money.

00:11:05.534 --> 00:11:07.342
They obviously have to
use some of that money

00:11:07.342 --> 00:11:09.869
to support all of this infrastructure.

00:11:09.869 --> 00:11:13.135
Then bank A is going to
make that interchange fee,

00:11:13.135 --> 00:11:15.676
which was the bulk of that discount rate,

00:11:15.676 --> 00:11:17.936
that retailer discount
rate, not related at all

00:11:17.936 --> 00:11:20.202
to the federal funds discount rate.

00:11:20.202 --> 00:11:22.469
Then, of course, they
extended credit to me,

00:11:22.469 --> 00:11:24.602
so that $100 might not
be paid immediately.

00:11:24.602 --> 00:11:27.202
They might be able to charge me 15-20%

00:11:27.202 --> 00:11:31.426
annualized percentage rate
interest on that money

00:11:31.426 --> 00:11:32.426
until I pay it off.

00:11:32.426 --> 00:11:35.214
Of course I have some
type of minimum balances

00:11:35.214 --> 00:11:35.963
to pay.

00:11:35.963 --> 00:11:38.212
Hopefully that explains
things a little bit.

00:11:38.212 --> 00:11:41.000
I'll see you in the next video.
