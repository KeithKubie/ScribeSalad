into the nature of demand for food and

how that has changed over time and
 

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:41.759
how that has changed over time and
what's striking is just how different in

you an example so in Japan the caloric

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:54.640
you an example so in Japan the caloric
 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.549

about 2,400 calories they were working

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:01.479
about 2,400 calories they were working
 

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:02.729
about 2,400 calories they were working
in factories that needed a lot of

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:02.739
in factories that needed a lot of
 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:05.490
in factories that needed a lot of
calories to about 1800 calories per

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:05.500
calories to about 1800 calories per

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:07.180
capita today they have no obesity
 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.840
capita today they have no obesity
problem and when you compare that to the

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850
problem and when you compare that to the
 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.090
problem and when you compare that to the
US and then Europe and also along other

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.100
US and then Europe and also along other
 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.859

dimensions of nutrition the differences

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:13.869
dimensions of nutrition the differences
 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:15.719
dimensions of nutrition the differences
are striking and I think from the US

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:15.729
are striking and I think from the US
 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:17.399
are striking and I think from the US
perspective the question is if we are so

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:17.409
perspective the question is if we are so
 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:19.709
perspective the question is if we are so
rich why is that we don't eat better

00:01:19.709 --> 00:01:19.719
rich why is that we don't eat better
 

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:22.020
rich why is that we don't eat better
food and what I want to argue is that

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030
food and what I want to argue is that
 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:23.999
food and what I want to argue is that
there is really a not a cultural

00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:24.009
there is really a not a cultural
 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:25.410
there is really a not a cultural
explanation it's really not about the

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420
explanation it's really not about the
 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.370
explanation it's really not about the
power of agribusiness but instead that

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380
power of agribusiness but instead that
 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.469
power of agribusiness but instead that
there is an important political moment

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:31.479
there is an important political moment
 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:33.149
there is an important political moment
that happens in all of these countries

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:33.159
that happens in all of these countries
 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:36.060
that happens in all of these countries
and it's at these critical junctures

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.070
and it's at these critical junctures
 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:37.230
and it's at these critical junctures
that you really set off in a new

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240
that you really set off in a new
 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:38.639
that you really set off in a new
trajectory and there there are two

00:01:38.639 --> 00:01:38.649
trajectory and there there are two
 

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:40.130
trajectory and there there are two
things that happen that really matter

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140
things that happen that really matter
 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.590
things that happen that really matter
for better for worse war turns out to be

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600
for better for worse war turns out to be
 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.050
for better for worse war turns out to be
very important for national food systems

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060
very important for national food systems
 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.029
very important for national food systems
and then more importantly I think the

00:01:48.029 --> 00:01:48.039
and then more importantly I think the
 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:50.160
and then more importantly I think the
transformation of the structure of the

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170
transformation of the structure of the
 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.340
transformation of the structure of the
family and especially the shifting role

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350
family and especially the shifting role
 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.370
family and especially the shifting role
in identity of women in home food

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380
in identity of women in home food
 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.380
in identity of women in home food
production I want to show you just a

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390
production I want to show you just a
 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.870
production I want to show you just a
little glimpse at both of those elements

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880
little glimpse at both of those elements
 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.359
little glimpse at both of those elements
and let me just say one motivating thing

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:03.369
and let me just say one motivating thing
 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:05.370
and let me just say one motivating thing
why would we worry about this we'll look

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380
why would we worry about this we'll look
 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.830
why would we worry about this we'll look
if you think it's about the changing

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840
if you think it's about the changing
 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.359
if you think it's about the changing
role of the families American families

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369
role of the families American families
 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:12.089
role of the families American families
have changed again and I think it at

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:12.099
have changed again and I think it at
 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:14.160
have changed again and I think it at
least looking historically at how these

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170
least looking historically at how these
 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:15.270
least looking historically at how these
transformations have

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280
transformations have
 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.940
transformations have
then open the possibility for imagining

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950
then open the possibility for imagining
 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.830
then open the possibility for imagining
a new transformation and how we think

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840
a new transformation and how we think
 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.680
a new transformation and how we think
about food and identity and family so

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690
about food and identity and family so
 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.530
about food and identity and family so
let me show you the history though so

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540
let me show you the history though so
 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.610
let me show you the history though so
first on war so of course war leads to

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620
first on war so of course war leads to
 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.110
first on war so of course war leads to
innovation that is absolutely true and

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120
innovation that is absolutely true and
 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.210
innovation that is absolutely true and
food as well so it turns out France in

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220
food as well so it turns out France in
 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.710
food as well so it turns out France in
the 19th century is basically at war all

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720
the 19th century is basically at war all
 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.420
the 19th century is basically at war all
the time and they invent almost all of

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430
the time and they invent almost all of
 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.500
the time and they invent almost all of
the major food processed food products

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510
the major food processed food products
 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.080
the major food processed food products
so canning but what i should say most of

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090
so canning but what i should say most of
 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.510
so canning but what i should say most of
these food innovations were developed

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520
these food innovations were developed
 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.350
these food innovations were developed
under prizes offered by the state to

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360
under prizes offered by the state to
 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.540
under prizes offered by the state to
develop something mainly for the army so

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550
develop something mainly for the army so
 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:53.310
develop something mainly for the army so
canning was developed under the napoleon

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320
canning was developed under the napoleon
 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.380
canning was developed under the napoleon
the first Napoleonic Wars Napoleon the

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390
the first Napoleonic Wars Napoleon the
 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.180
the first Napoleonic Wars Napoleon the
third made a prize for oleo margarine

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190
third made a prize for oleo margarine
 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.759
third made a prize for oleo margarine
and then frozen foods comes during a

00:02:59.759 --> 00:02:59.769
and then frozen foods comes during a
 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:02.130
and then frozen foods comes during a
time of significant food shortage after

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140
time of significant food shortage after
 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.400
time of significant food shortage after
a big big military loss and what's so

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410
a big big military loss and what's so
 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:07.199
a big big military loss and what's so
fascinating is that first of all the

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209
fascinating is that first of all the
 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:09.720
fascinating is that first of all the
guys who invented these things most of

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730
guys who invented these things most of
 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.009
guys who invented these things most of
them made no money on them so they

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:11.019
them made no money on them so they
 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:13.740
them made no money on them so they
basically died poppers and it all the

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750
basically died poppers and it all the
 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.780
basically died poppers and it all the
way they invented these products it

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790
way they invented these products it
 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.880
way they invented these products it
really is other people who take them up

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890
really is other people who take them up
 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.060
really is other people who take them up
and start to adopt them so Borden who

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.070
and start to adopt them so Borden who
 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:22.560
and start to adopt them so Borden who
goes to France and learns about

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:22.570
goes to France and learns about
 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:26.039
goes to France and learns about
autoclaving in order to can milk ends up

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:26.049
autoclaving in order to can milk ends up
 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:28.020
autoclaving in order to can milk ends up
making a killing when the Civil War hits

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030
making a killing when the Civil War hits
 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.120
making a killing when the Civil War hits
in the US and sells an enormous amount

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130
in the US and sells an enormous amount
 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:32.690
in the US and sells an enormous amount
of food to both the North and the South

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700
of food to both the North and the South
 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.759
of food to both the North and the South
bird's-eye seafood also his freezing

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:35.769
bird's-eye seafood also his freezing
 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:38.370
bird's-eye seafood also his freezing
technology also comes from France he has

the professional workforce a lot of this
is triggered by the war is obviously and

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:42.650
is triggered by the war is obviously and
 

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:45.129
is triggered by the war is obviously and
and that causes a renegotiation of the

00:06:45.129 --> 00:06:45.139
and that causes a renegotiation of the
 

00:06:45.139 --> 00:06:46.600
and that causes a renegotiation of the
status and role of women and families

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:46.610
status and role of women and families
 

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:48.460
status and role of women and families
