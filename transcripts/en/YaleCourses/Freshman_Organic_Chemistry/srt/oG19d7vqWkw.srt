1
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:06,240
So you remember pastor
was very fond of, of, uh,

2
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:10,860
received making tartaric acid.
So when he'd travel around,

3
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:15,540
he would look for samples of
tartaric acid. They're very,

4
00:00:15,541 --> 00:00:19,440
uh, detailed accounts that he
published to these travels.

5
00:00:19,441 --> 00:00:24,390
I haven't found this one, so I'm not
sure it's true. It may be apocryphal,

6
00:00:24,391 --> 00:00:27,240
but it was told me by the guy
who taught me organic chemistry.

7
00:00:27,241 --> 00:00:30,690
So I pass it on to you for what it's
worth because it makes a good point.

8
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:34,290
He said that posture was in Alsace,

9
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:38,700
that wine producing region in northeast
France and in the town of Tom,

10
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:43,710
he found in a pharmacy a bottle of
receiving weak acid that was moldy.

11
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:47,190
So remember receiving
acids, the 50, 50 mixture.

12
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:51,390
So since he liked receive mic acid,
and in fact it was becoming rare.

13
00:00:51,391 --> 00:00:55,020
It's not a very common product.
Mostly you get the handed stuff.

14
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:00,570
So we took it back and cleaned
it up, got rid of the, the, uh,

15
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:02,190
mold that was growing on it.

16
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:06,540
And what he found was that
after he had purified it,

17
00:01:06,541 --> 00:01:08,010
it was the unnatural.

18
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,820
The left hand did not
the one you normally get.

19
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,090
Can you see an explanation for that?

20
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,590
Why did had the apothecary mislabeled it?

21
00:01:19,591 --> 00:01:23,490
Because he thought he could get a higher
price for receiving me confer tartaric

22
00:01:23,491 --> 00:01:27,160
acid or might have been innocent. Zack,

23
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,170
what? What would, what did the mold do?

24
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:36,540
Didn't convert the mold.
Eight.

25
00:01:36,541 --> 00:01:40,440
The natural stuff converted it into
something completely different.

26
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,330
Leaving the unnatural one.
Okay.

27
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:48,210
Remember the smell of the
car owns natural things,

28
00:01:48,211 --> 00:01:52,950
enzymes and so on can distinguish between
the two hands and naturally the stuff

29
00:01:52,951 --> 00:01:56,760
that normally eats tartaric acid is
going to eat normal tartaric acid,

30
00:01:56,761 --> 00:01:59,400
not the unusual ones.
So it left the unusual one.

31
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:04,890
The penicillium glaucoma had eaten the Rr.
Okay.

32
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:06,620
So that's one way of doing ras,

33
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:11,690
of doing resolution to get rid of wanting
antitumor from a receiving mixture,

34
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,500
leaving the other one.
Uh,

35
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:17,520
because Daya Steri Americ
reactions have different rates.

36
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:20,750
It's a right hand shaking or right
hand versus the right hand shaking the

37
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:24,300
lefthand. They're just different. So
one will go faster than the other.

38
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,260
So if you react Uracil Rasamayi
with some chiral reagent,

39
00:02:28,261 --> 00:02:31,680
of course you have to use only one hand
of that other thing you add in there,

40
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,170
but then you'll react with
one more than the other.

41
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:38,670
It could be even a catalyst so that
it doesn't get consumed for an enzyme,

42
00:02:38,671 --> 00:02:39,504
for example.

43
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:43,620
But that's not nature's way because it's
very inefficient to make both and then

44
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:48,120
destroy one. What nature does is
prepare only wanting a a tumor.

45
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:49,770
And you can do that.

46
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:53,630
Prepare only won by starting with
something that's already a single lien,

47
00:02:53,631 --> 00:02:55,260
a Auntie Maria and building on that.

48
00:02:55,890 --> 00:03:00,890
Or you can use a reagent which is
resolved that will that because Daya Steri

49
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:05,130
Americ rates are different.
We'll pretend to produce one, uh,

50
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:06,940
one of the two enantiomers.

51
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:12,490
So here's an example of this molecule
we've been talking about Asi seven, three,

52
00:03:12,491 --> 00:03:17,470
eight, nine, with its 19
asymmetric centers that's made
artificially commercially.

53
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:21,190
Uh, and this is where
those 19 centers came from.

54
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:25,750
Five of them came from starting materials
that they bought as a single hand,

55
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:30,520
but the rest were all made.
One of them was done by chromatography.

56
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:35,370
They have chromatography columns about
this big around and this high with Cairo

57
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,610
stuff inside.

58
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:40,210
So you pass your thing through one hand
to goes through a little faster than the

59
00:03:40,211 --> 00:03:41,820
other because it's Di Diet,

60
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:46,630
dietary Americ interaction with the
packing one comes through quicker and they

61
00:03:46,631 --> 00:03:49,210
actually do that for one of the centers.

62
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:53,890
But the others are all done by reactions
that preferentially give one center

63
00:03:53,891 --> 00:03:58,270
rather than the other three of them are
ones that everybody knew which one they

64
00:03:58,271 --> 00:03:59,470
would give the other ones.

65
00:03:59,471 --> 00:04:04,450
They just had to hope and and fiddle
around with different reactions until they

66
00:04:04,451 --> 00:04:06,630
found one that would do the trick.
So anyhow,

67
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,090
they were able to generate
these 19 stereo centers.

68
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:15,580
Now we're left with a problem that that
incidentally is all we're going to have

69
00:04:15,581 --> 00:04:17,830
for the exam on Friday.
Okay.

70
00:04:17,831 --> 00:04:21,610
So now we're on to other stuff that
will be covered on the final exam and in

71
00:04:21,611 --> 00:04:24,630
particular return to this
question about the tartaric acid.

72
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:29,650
Remember there's d plus and l minus
cause you have l plus and d minus

73
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:33,880
of a different compound.

74
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:40,170
Why not?
What does D or l mean in this context?

75
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:45,220
That's
Andrew.

76
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:50,920
It means which way it rotates the light.
Right?

77
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:54,940
And the plus means the same thing as d.
So it's redundant,

78
00:04:54,941 --> 00:04:56,380
this particular nomenclature.

79
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,400
But there's a question mark because
when fee Fisher just guest remember,

80
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:04,900
and it could easily have been the
opposite. So which way is it? Right?

81
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:10,120
So if we knew,
if we knew how optical activity worked,

82
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,670
then by measuring the Abdel activity,

83
00:05:12,671 --> 00:05:16,010
we'd know which of those
structures is right. Okay.

84
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:19,390
But we don't know that at least,
I don't know that.

85
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:24,490
Now there's a lot of knowledge about
this, but it's a very, very tough problem.

86
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,100
Fortunately.
Uh,

87
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:31,030
there's a book by Lawrence Baron called
molecular light scattering and optical

88
00:05:31,031 --> 00:05:35,770
activity, which goes into this stuff.
And I see professor of a care, oh,

89
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:39,250
so we have a copy of the book.
That's great.

90
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,800
But even better than that,
we have Lawrence baron or a copy of,

91
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,430
or a coffee of Lawrence Baron. Perhaps
it's the mirror image of Lawrence Baron.

92
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:51,670
So he's going to tell us how this works.

93
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,100
So we've got the stuff on your

94
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:58,933
collar

95
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:03,860
and there is your clicker.
Okay,

96
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:11,510
well,
good morning everybody.

97
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:16,750
I was both from delighted and dismayed
at the same time when professor McBride

98
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,830
asked me to try and, uh, uh,

99
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,460
thinks well to address you this morning,

100
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:27,730
delighted to have the opportunity to talk
science to some of America's brightest

101
00:06:28,191 --> 00:06:29,870
budding young scientists,

102
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:34,940
but also dismayed that he asked me to
try and explain the molecular origin of

103
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:39,680
optical rotation optical activity.
It's a very subtle,

104
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:40,400
difficult,

105
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,930
delicate problem that's exercise some
of the finest minds in physics and

106
00:06:44,931 --> 00:06:47,900
chemistry for the last hundred years.
But anyway,

107
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,330
let's see how it goes towards the end.

108
00:06:50,331 --> 00:06:54,800
I think I may be presenting some stuff
that's sort of beyond the boundaries of

109
00:06:54,801 --> 00:06:56,660
your current knowledge,
but anyway,

110
00:06:56,661 --> 00:06:59,810
it can at least pass
in front of your eyes.

111
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:05,090
So can I run a t then
beans as you well know,

112
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:10,091
right or left hand Ignis it pervades much
of modern science from the physics of

113
00:07:10,701 --> 00:07:15,680
elementary particles through organic
stereochemistry to the structure and

114
00:07:15,681 --> 00:07:20,681
behavior of the molecules of life with
a lot more besides that comes up in

115
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:25,030
what's called nonlinear optics
involving intense lasers,

116
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:29,450
nano technology materials, electrical
engineering, pharmaceuticals,

117
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:32,820
astrobiology and origin
of life. So it's, it's,

118
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:36,890
it's a very important
theme in modern science.

119
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:42,560
Now, first of all though, I'll, I'll
tell you a little bit about Lord Calvin.

120
00:07:42,561 --> 00:07:47,561
He was the first person to introduce the
word [inaudible] Allity into science.

121
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:51,890
He was professor of natural
philosophy and Glasgow,

122
00:07:51,891 --> 00:07:56,690
which is my home university, um,
through, um, most of his career.

123
00:07:56,691 --> 00:08:00,650
He will all of his career. He was
one of the giants of physics of the,

124
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:03,470
of the 19th century.
Um,

125
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:09,110
he's best known for inventing the
absolute, uh, Kelvin temperature scale.

126
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:13,340
Now, he was originally, his
original name was William Thompson,

127
00:08:13,341 --> 00:08:17,900
but then he became famous and became,
so William Thompson.

128
00:08:17,901 --> 00:08:21,950
Then he became even more famous.
So they made him a lord.

129
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:24,070
And when you're made a law in the UK,

130
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,740
you choose your title from some
place that's dear to your heart,

131
00:08:27,741 --> 00:08:32,720
may be your home area. He took his title
from the, the name of the river, Calvin,

132
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:35,810
which runs through the
university park in Glasgow.

133
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:39,770
So whenever you use the absolute
temperature scale now in the future,

134
00:08:39,771 --> 00:08:44,360
you can picture this idyllic scene.
Anyway.

135
00:08:44,361 --> 00:08:47,900
So he was the first to introduce
the word Chi reality into science.

136
00:08:47,901 --> 00:08:51,080
And here's his definition,
which you'll be familiar with.

137
00:08:51,081 --> 00:08:55,020
I call any geometrical figure or
group of points chiral and say,

138
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:58,230
but it has chi Rolla,
if it's image in the Plain Mirror,

139
00:08:58,231 --> 00:09:01,680
ideally realized cannot be brought
into coincidence with itself.

140
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:03,910
That was in his Baltimore lectures.

141
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:08,930
So he's just emphasizing the non super
imposed the ability of the mirror image,

142
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:13,480
the team as of a or a molecule. But of
course the whole subject started uh,

143
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:18,990
earlier with the wonderful work
of Louie pastor who showed, um,

144
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:24,360
mirror image chiral molecule show
optical rotation of equal magnitude but

145
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:29,100
opposite sign,
which was an epoch making discovery.

146
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:34,430
So you've come across then this a the
fundamental manifestation of optical

147
00:09:34,771 --> 00:09:38,550
activity,
which is natural optical rotation.

148
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:42,930
You put linearly polarized
light beam into a sample,

149
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:47,610
say sample of a nicer tropic
collection of chiral molecules,

150
00:09:47,611 --> 00:09:51,030
like a sugar solution and it will come
out the other side with the plane of

151
00:09:51,031 --> 00:09:54,180
polarization rotated through some angle.

152
00:09:54,181 --> 00:09:56,220
And if you put it in the
mirror image version,

153
00:09:56,221 --> 00:10:00,270
you'll get an equal but opposite
sense of optical rotation.

154
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:05,820
Now it's not to be confused with something
called magnetic optical rotation.

155
00:10:05,821 --> 00:10:08,760
The faraday effect,
I've just mentioning this to you.

156
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:11,730
You've probably haven't come
across the faraday effect yet,

157
00:10:11,731 --> 00:10:16,470
but you may do later on in your
studies or in your professional life.

158
00:10:16,471 --> 00:10:18,450
So I'll mentioned the faraday effect.

159
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:23,610
Faraday discovered in 1846
that a chiral samples,

160
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:27,870
not, not no, no optical out, no
natural uptick in activity there.

161
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,340
If you apply a static magnetic
field parallel to the light beam,

162
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:37,050
that will induce an optical rotation.
And if you put in,

163
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:41,250
if you reverse the direction of the
magnetic field relative to the light beam,

164
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:46,200
you'll get an equal and opposite sense
of optical rotation. Um, you know,

165
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,470
it would even work say for a
sample of water, for instance,

166
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,410
any material we'll show a faraday effect.

167
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:58,080
But this has been a source of
much confusion. In fact, um, uh,

168
00:10:58,081 --> 00:11:02,310
to scientists. Now, Lord
Kelvin was on the ball here.

169
00:11:02,311 --> 00:11:05,100
He knew all about it. He's,
he made a statement here.

170
00:11:05,101 --> 00:11:10,101
He said the magnetic rotation has neither
right handed or left handed quality.

171
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:14,810
That is to say no Kyron city.
It's got nothing to do with [inaudible].

172
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:19,590
This was perfectly understood by Faraday
and made clear in his writings there.

173
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,150
Even to the present day,

174
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,650
we frequently find the chiral rotation
of the magnetic rotation of the plane of

175
00:11:25,651 --> 00:11:26,610
polarization

176
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:33,240
class together in a manner against which
Faraday's original description contains

177
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:37,410
ample warning. Well, Lord Kelvin
would be turning in his grave today,

178
00:11:37,411 --> 00:11:40,930
a hundred years later because
you still see papers, um,

179
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:44,220
which involve the faraday
effect in some way or other.

180
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:49,220
And in the introduction they taught
grandly of inducing Chi reality with a

181
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:53,980
magnetic field that is
completely wrong. Um, just uh,

182
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:56,600
for the record, it probably, uh,

183
00:11:57,610 --> 00:11:59,320
beyond your knowledge at the moment.

184
00:11:59,321 --> 00:12:02,230
Chiral phenomenon like
natural optical rotation,

185
00:12:02,231 --> 00:12:07,060
they're characterized by what's called
tiny even pseudo scale observables.

186
00:12:07,061 --> 00:12:12,061
A pseudo scalar is a number that changes
sign under reflection or inversion.

187
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,500
We'll, we'll leave it at that. But so
that, that's for the record. But w well,

188
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:22,750
it turns out that the essential cemetery
characteristics of natural and magnetic

189
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:27,430
optical rotation a completely different
and you need different sorts of,

190
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,480
um, you know, quantum
molecular quantum states,

191
00:12:31,481 --> 00:12:33,670
different characteristics to support them.

192
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,880
But we won't pursue that right now.

193
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:42,220
Back to natural optical rotation.
Um,

194
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:46,360
for now we bring in
circularly polarized light.

195
00:12:46,361 --> 00:12:49,510
So in order to detect
molecular [inaudible],

196
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:54,070
you must have some sort
of chiral prob well,

197
00:12:55,990 --> 00:13:00,850
what we're using here is right and
left circularly polarized light beans.

198
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:05,860
They are actually mirror image chiral
systems so they can be used as chiral

199
00:13:05,861 --> 00:13:06,694
probes.

200
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:11,940
So here's a representation of a
right circularly polarized lightbeam.

201
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:16,850
Um, now you, you know,
that light is involves, um,

202
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:20,410
electromagnetic oscillations in space.

203
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:22,620
And usually you,

204
00:13:22,621 --> 00:13:26,730
you just think of the oscillating
electric vector of a lightweight,

205
00:13:26,731 --> 00:13:30,940
even if it's linearly polarized,
it's oscillating in, in one plane.

206
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:36,370
There's actually also an oscillating
magnetic field vector that's oscillates

207
00:13:36,371 --> 00:13:39,400
perpendicular to the electric.
We'll come back to that later.

208
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:42,460
This is where just looking at the
oscillating electric vector here,

209
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:46,300
so if it's linearly polarized,
it's plain polarized.

210
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,010
It's just oscillating in a plane,

211
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:53,490
but circularly polarized light as well
as the oscillation in this direction.

212
00:13:53,861 --> 00:13:58,480
You also have an electric factor
oscillating perpendicular,

213
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:02,050
but I'm 90 degrees out of phase,

214
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:04,680
and what happens is,
um,

215
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:10,150
you get this circular polarization.
Now this picture here,

216
00:14:10,151 --> 00:14:15,151
this represents the instantaneous electric
vectors at different points in space,

217
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:20,320
in the direction of propagation
along the z direction.

218
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:22,870
And so here we are.

219
00:14:22,871 --> 00:14:27,790
That's just a showing that just connected
the ends of the instantaneous electric

220
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:31,930
vectors. And there it is. The
left circularly polarized. Anyway,

221
00:14:31,931 --> 00:14:35,380
you can see that at the very
least, those are, those are Chiral,

222
00:14:35,381 --> 00:14:38,830
those are helix and those
appear image colonel systems.

223
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:43,320
Now Ah, here we go. This, this, this,

224
00:14:43,321 --> 00:14:47,930
an extra sciencey stuff that
professor, but bride added to my, uh,

225
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:52,760
my presentation. He doesn't like
it was simple and static. Uh,

226
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,220
anyway, so there we are. So,

227
00:14:57,050 --> 00:14:59,210
so now if you look at the wave,

228
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:04,300
if you just look at the electric
vector through in a fixed plane,

229
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,560
as the light wave is propagating,

230
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:11,360
there's the electric vector and
it will rotate in the fixed plane.

231
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:16,040
So rotating clockwise, that defines
right circularly polarized light.

232
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:19,280
And here we go.

233
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:25,640
Broke tasting counter clockwise.
That's left circularly polarized light.

234
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:29,600
Okay. So where we now have, um,

235
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:33,410
a chiral optical probe
circularly polarized light.

236
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:37,940
Now chiral molecules respond slightly
differently to right and left circularly

237
00:15:37,941 --> 00:15:41,470
polarized light. Um, you know, and I mean,

238
00:15:41,471 --> 00:15:45,890
an extreme example is say in the world
of, of engineering, you, you know,

239
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:51,080
you can't fit a lefthanded
not onto a right handed bolt.

240
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:55,860
That's an extreme example of
different, uh, you know, uh,

241
00:15:56,350 --> 00:16:00,950
uh, chiral interactions. Well, it's
obviously a much more delicate than that.

242
00:16:00,951 --> 00:16:05,570
Here point is right and left circularly
polarized light interact just slightly

243
00:16:05,571 --> 00:16:09,770
differently with,
with a molecule of a given try reality.

244
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:11,863
Anyway,

245
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:15,800
there's a differential absorption of
right and left circularly polarized light

246
00:16:15,801 --> 00:16:18,950
that corresponds to a phenomenon
called circular dichroic awesome,

247
00:16:18,951 --> 00:16:22,850
which is the basis of a widely
used form of spectroscopy,

248
00:16:22,851 --> 00:16:25,550
used to study a chiral molecules.

249
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:30,940
But now what gives rise
to optical rotation is a
difference in refractive index

250
00:16:32,481 --> 00:16:36,830
towards, um, uh, of right and left
circularly polarized light beans.

251
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:44,360
Now linearly polarized light.

252
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:49,280
You can describe it as a coherent
superposition of right and left circularly

253
00:16:49,281 --> 00:16:51,680
polarized waves of equal amplitude.

254
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:56,000
Coherent means they're in phase with
each other rather than being, you know,

255
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:56,883
random.

256
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:01,640
They're oscillating in phase with
some fixed phase relationship.

257
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:06,290
So, for example, now here's
a linearly polarized, um, um,

258
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:07,490
light beam,

259
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:12,610
but you can decompose it into a super
position of a left circular and the right

260
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:18,890
circular component.
You see it when those are at the top,

261
00:17:18,891 --> 00:17:20,880
they're reinforcing and uh,

262
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:24,710
you've got the maximum linearly
polarized vector up here.

263
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:27,560
As they come away,
left and right,

264
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:31,460
they will tend to increasingly
cancel and that will decrease.

265
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:36,170
And when they're this way and
this way you'll have zero, um,

266
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:41,150
electric field back to there. And as
you come down, that will increase again.

267
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,120
So you, so you can, you
can decompose a lineage,

268
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:49,100
linearly polarized light into a coherent
superposition of, of left and right,

269
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:51,420
um, waves. Now,

270
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:57,710
refractive index corresponds
to a velocity through a medium.

271
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:00,203
Um,

272
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:05,220
so if there's a difference in refractive
index for right and left circularly

273
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:06,810
polarized light beams,

274
00:18:06,811 --> 00:18:10,440
that means there's a slight difference
in the velocity of the right and left

275
00:18:10,441 --> 00:18:13,440
circularly polarized light
beams going through the medium.

276
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:19,290
So the phase relation between the two
contra rotating electric factors will

277
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:22,760
change. And you can easily
see this will give you a,

278
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:26,130
a rotation in the plane of polarization.
You see if,

279
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,380
if there's a difference in velocity,

280
00:18:28,381 --> 00:18:32,310
then it cements that this back to
will this electric vectors of the left

281
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,880
component will be here and
the right component here.

282
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:40,140
And if you take the results and
you see it's, it's, it's no longer,

283
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,790
um,
where it was.

284
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:46,970
So this is a simple picture of how
optical rotation develops in terms of,

285
00:18:48,481 --> 00:18:53,190
um, different refractive indices of the
right or left components. Um, now there's,

286
00:18:53,191 --> 00:18:57,390
um, there's a, a picture in
Atkins physical chemistry.

287
00:18:57,391 --> 00:18:59,100
He tries to illustrate this there.

288
00:18:59,101 --> 00:19:02,520
He's got the linearly polarized been
coming through and you've got the,

289
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:05,430
but he's broken it down
into the left and right.

290
00:19:05,431 --> 00:19:09,930
And he's saying the two velocities are
slightly different and that gives you the

291
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:13,020
results. Optical rotation, um,

292
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:19,070
you can easily develop an expression for
the angle of rotation as a function of

293
00:19:20,251 --> 00:19:24,210
the difference in refractive indices
for left and right circularly polarized

294
00:19:24,211 --> 00:19:27,240
light beams. And it's also, it's
a function of the path length.

295
00:19:27,241 --> 00:19:30,750
Obviously the longer the path
links, the, the, the more, uh,

296
00:19:30,751 --> 00:19:34,260
rotation we'll develop.
And, um, it's, there's,

297
00:19:34,261 --> 00:19:38,100
there's the wavelength there
in the denominator. In fact,

298
00:19:38,101 --> 00:19:40,270
I mean this is the secret.
There's path length.

299
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:43,260
That's the secret of how you
get a measurable rotation.

300
00:19:43,261 --> 00:19:46,080
Cause this is an incredibly tiny effect.

301
00:19:46,081 --> 00:19:48,450
If it was just a single molecule event,

302
00:19:48,451 --> 00:19:52,470
you're looking at the polarization
changes, you, you wouldn't see anything.

303
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:53,303
They're so tiny,

304
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:58,460
but you can build up this rotation
over long path link centimeters or even

305
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:02,710
meters. Um, in fact, um, if,

306
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:07,740
if you go to Google and Google images
and just Google circularly polarized

307
00:20:09,001 --> 00:20:11,250
light,
you'll find lots of sites there which,

308
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:15,250
which described polarized light
and they provide beautiful, um,

309
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:19,110
simulations, animations of, of,

310
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:20,340
of this effect here.

311
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:24,300
I didn't want to download any
and try and show them here,

312
00:20:24,301 --> 00:20:26,370
but I would encourage you to go to that.

313
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:29,670
But go and look in
particular at this site here,

314
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:34,090
ends in dot u that's comes from,
uh,

315
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:36,960
an institute of enzymology
and Buddha Pass.

316
00:20:36,961 --> 00:20:41,670
They've got some beautiful simulations
of this optical rotation process and

317
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:46,700
another more exotic a polarization effects
as light propagates through latter.

318
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:55,010
Now let's try and, uh, so
that's, that's just, um, uh,

319
00:20:55,011 --> 00:20:58,960
what would you say? A phenomenal
logical description. And in fact,

320
00:20:58,961 --> 00:21:02,770
that's where most physical chemistry
textbooks stop. And in fact,

321
00:21:02,771 --> 00:21:06,250
Atkins physical chemistry stops
at that point. And then just,

322
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:10,120
there's just sort of hand
waving saying, okay, you know,

323
00:21:10,121 --> 00:21:14,380
right and left circularly polarized light
interacts like knee differently with

324
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:18,310
the chiral molecule and they leave it at
that and they don't attempt to try and

325
00:21:18,311 --> 00:21:21,520
give you a picture and a molecular detail.

326
00:21:21,521 --> 00:21:26,080
But a professor McBride wanted
me to try and attempt this.

327
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:30,730
So just as a, as a start, as
this is a simple, simple picture,

328
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:34,270
a simple scattering picture of,
of optical rotation.

329
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:40,470
Now a circularly polarized and lightwave
bouncing from one group to the other,

330
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:45,280
um, as it scatters from a simple
two group chiral structure,

331
00:21:45,281 --> 00:21:46,930
we'll sample the Chi [inaudible].

332
00:21:46,931 --> 00:21:51,490
So here we have a simple two
group chiral molecular structure.

333
00:21:51,491 --> 00:21:56,410
So we've got to a chiral groups
held in a rigid twisted arrangement.

334
00:21:56,411 --> 00:22:01,390
I think that's, that's lefthanded I've
got there. Um, and you can break down,

335
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:04,450
you look at most chiral molecules,
just look at the bonds.

336
00:22:04,451 --> 00:22:08,890
You can often break them down. You can
see these sorts of two groups structures,

337
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:13,360
uh, um, throughout. Um, anyway,

338
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:14,680
uh,

339
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:19,680
so a [inaudible] model of optical rotation
is that the lightwave it bounces from

340
00:22:21,011 --> 00:22:26,011
one group to the other before coming off
and getting involved in the generating

341
00:22:26,021 --> 00:22:30,430
the optical rotation phenomenon.
Um, but you can see it's,

342
00:22:30,431 --> 00:22:34,840
it's sampling the [inaudible] as it
bounces from one to the other. So if the,

343
00:22:34,841 --> 00:22:37,960
if the light beam is right,
circularly polarized,

344
00:22:37,961 --> 00:22:42,961
that bouncing process will have a
slightly different amplitude as we say,

345
00:22:43,541 --> 00:22:48,310
from if it's left circularly polarized.
So that gives you a simple picture.

346
00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:52,990
It's worth mentioning that this is the
basis of something called the dynamic

347
00:22:52,991 --> 00:22:57,991
coupling model of optical activity that
was developed by somebody called John

348
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:04,570
Kirkwood, who was a chairman of
this department in the 1950s. Um,

349
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:10,870
well now we really have to

350
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:16,870
have to grasp the nettle at this point

351
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:22,420
because you just, it's hopeless
and messing around with these,

352
00:23:22,421 --> 00:23:24,590
these simple models. They, they,

353
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:30,340
they don't get to anywhere as
regards prediction, you know, uh,

354
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:34,840
relating a structure to
sign and magnitude of,

355
00:23:34,841 --> 00:23:38,590
of optical activity.
You have to go to the quantum mechanics.

356
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:43,570
So now this was the expression for
the optical rotation in terms of the

357
00:23:43,571 --> 00:23:47,840
refractive index difference for less
than rights that can be polarized light.

358
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:53,710
Now you can develop this using something
called quantum mechanical perturbation

359
00:23:53,841 --> 00:23:58,841
theory and you develop an expression
for the rotation angle in terms of this

360
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:03,560
incomprehensible looking stuff.

361
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:07,470
But let me just try and give
you a feel for what it, uh,

362
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:13,300
what it's telling us that the heart of
it is this so called rotational strength,

363
00:24:14,721 --> 00:24:17,950
which involves the so scale,

364
00:24:17,951 --> 00:24:22,951
a product of an electric dipole and
a magnetic dipole transition moment.

365
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:27,860
So what we've got here is there's
the ground state of the molecule.

366
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:32,910
N J is some excited electronic state
and mew is the electric dipole operator

367
00:24:34,131 --> 00:24:37,730
that's connecting the
ground to the excited state.

368
00:24:37,731 --> 00:24:41,630
And the lightwave is, is, is interacting,

369
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:45,950
is coupling with this electric dipole
operator and it's driving the transition.

370
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:49,940
And it's this, these electric
dipole transitions like this,

371
00:24:49,941 --> 00:24:52,850
that's the behind
conventional spectroscopy.

372
00:24:52,851 --> 00:24:57,320
You've done probably UV
and infrared spectroscopy,

373
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:03,280
but now what we have in addition is the
same transition but now brought about

374
00:25:04,221 --> 00:25:08,090
through m,
that's called a magnetic dipole operator.

375
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:13,350
And that's activated by this oscillating
magnetic components of the light wave.

376
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:19,610
Um, and so you have this so
called scale of products that,

377
00:25:19,611 --> 00:25:24,190
so myu dot m that would be mew,
x Mx plus mew,

378
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:29,060
y m y plus music. Then said, some
of you have probably done vectors,

379
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:33,860
maybe others haven't, but okay,
so that, that's the heart of it.

380
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:38,720
But this is a very important feature here.
We're summing over all excited states,

381
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:41,450
Jay,
all excited states.

382
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:45,920
So the whole plethora of excited
states of a car or molecule,

383
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:47,030
um,

384
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:52,030
come in here and some can can give you
one particular excited state can give you

385
00:25:52,671 --> 00:25:57,320
a positive contribution to
the optical rotation. Another
one, a negative, you know,

386
00:25:57,321 --> 00:26:00,500
so it's a very,
very subtle problem and um,

387
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:03,680
and you have to consider
them all carefully.

388
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:09,710
So optical activity ultimately originates
an interference between electric and

389
00:26:09,711 --> 00:26:14,420
magnetic dipole transitions during
the light scattering process.

390
00:26:14,421 --> 00:26:16,700
That's the sort of the heart of it.

391
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:25,030
Now, let me just show you how this
works out. I can now give you, uh, uh,

392
00:26:25,170 --> 00:26:29,180
a chemical, uh, an
interpretation in terms of, um,

393
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:34,400
of a real and highly important
system in inorganic chemistry.

394
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,280
The carbonyl Chroma fall,

395
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:40,640
I believe you have come across the
carbon are Kromer for a lot of important

396
00:26:40,641 --> 00:26:44,250
organic molecules contain
this Carbonell chromophores.

397
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:49,820
It gives rise to a transition in the
near ultraviolet at about 290 nanometers

398
00:26:52,261 --> 00:26:56,560
and it's widely used in physical,
organic chemistry and,

399
00:26:57,660 --> 00:27:01,560
um,
it's called the end to Pi star transition.

400
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:07,260
Now, the carbonyl group itself,
there it is. That's not chiral.

401
00:27:07,261 --> 00:27:12,000
That's, that's got to play in
a cemetery. So it by itself,

402
00:27:12,001 --> 00:27:15,270
it's not go, there's going to
be no optical activity there.

403
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:18,240
But you see in this
particular molecule here,

404
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:23,120
three Mikael cyclohexanone
fat molecule overall, his car,

405
00:27:23,121 --> 00:27:25,320
or there's a chiral centered there.

406
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:30,680
So that carbonyl group is experiencing
a chiral perturbation or through space

407
00:27:31,861 --> 00:27:34,860
perturbation from the rest
of the chiral molecule.

408
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:40,730
And that induces [inaudible] into the
electronic transitions of the carbonyl

409
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:45,440
group and in juices,
optical rotation and circular Dyke Rosen.

410
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:48,810
Well,
let's look at this in a bit more detail.

411
00:27:48,811 --> 00:27:51,960
This a famous into to Pi star transition.

412
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,310
So here we've got the,

413
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:57,780
the sigma bonding or
of the carbonyl group.

414
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:03,250
There's the pie bonding
orbitals made up of two, uh, uh,

415
00:28:03,410 --> 00:28:07,290
p Pi on carbon and oxygen.

416
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:12,180
And, uh, here is a loan here, sorry.

417
00:28:12,181 --> 00:28:17,140
Here is a p y or before. So, so
those are, those are px or bottles.

418
00:28:17,141 --> 00:28:21,150
That's, that's The p y or
buffalo on the oxygen feed,

419
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:24,320
electrons in.
And so you've got to the ground state,

420
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:28,950
you've got to there to there and you've
got two electrons in the pee while,

421
00:28:28,951 --> 00:28:33,780
but also those are lone pair electrons,
so the lowest order,

422
00:28:33,781 --> 00:28:36,870
but the lowest transition now is the,

423
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:41,760
the p y to Pi staff often called
the enterprise star transition.

424
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:46,760
You're promoting one electron from the
Pyr bottle up to the Pi star or Bethel.

425
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:50,510
And that's the, that's the
origin of, of this, uh,

426
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:55,080
transition. Well, let's,

427
00:28:56,810 --> 00:29:00,630
uh, now, okay, now this transition,

428
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:04,740
it happens to be fully
back detic dipole aloud,

429
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:09,720
but completely electric dipole for bitten.
What happens.

430
00:29:09,721 --> 00:29:14,550
This electric dipole character
is induced by mixing, well,

431
00:29:14,551 --> 00:29:17,580
I'm giving the example of of a,
of a higher oxygen,

432
00:29:17,581 --> 00:29:22,350
d y Zed orbital into the Pi
Star or buckle. Now professor,

433
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:26,580
but bride has been messing around with,
by presentation here.

434
00:29:26,581 --> 00:29:30,900
Let's see what he's done. So here,

435
00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:34,820
so here's the, here's
the, an orbital, uh, the,

436
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:37,710
the pee while battle
of the carbonyl group.

437
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:43,420
There's the Pi Star. Oh No, here we go.

438
00:29:43,421 --> 00:29:46,670
So this is now and then,

439
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:49,010
but yeah,

440
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:54,380
so here you can see in that
enterprise star transition,

441
00:29:54,701 --> 00:29:59,570
there's, there's a net rotation of, of
charge, a rotation of charge. And that's,

442
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:04,420
that's the essence of the
magnetic dipole allowed character,

443
00:30:04,421 --> 00:30:08,950
magnetic dipole and transitions
involve a rotation of charge

444
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:17,450
for this change in the orientation.
That way,

445
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:22,990
right? So what's, ah,
okay, now here we go again.

446
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:26,980
Now here's a d y,
zed or Bethel.

447
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:31,990
Now one could consider a whole loads
of other possible orbitals to big sin.

448
00:30:31,991 --> 00:30:36,640
But this is the simplest one to just
to illustrate the, the idea here.

449
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:39,010
So there's a d y,
zed orbital.

450
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:45,730
Now going from you c and Two d y Zed. You,

451
00:30:45,890 --> 00:30:50,770
if you add those orbitals
together, the, that, the, uh,

452
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:55,690
you, you tend to get a
displacement of charge in the,

453
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:59,110
in the, um, in the zed direction.

454
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:04,350
So now you'll see you have a combination
of a rotation of charge with a

455
00:31:04,391 --> 00:31:09,391
displacement of charge and
rotation plus translation.

456
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:14,590
Gibbs, he listened. He, and here we go.

457
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:20,770
Yeah. So by mixing in a
little bit of the, um,

458
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:24,220
this dx said orbital,
um,

459
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:29,260
you get this w which is electric
dipole allowed you get this, um, this,

460
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:32,140
he listed it in,
in the transition.

461
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:39,500
No, in fact, um, the,

462
00:31:39,501 --> 00:31:44,501
the rotation of of charged generates a
magnetic dipole perpendicular to the,

463
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:50,540
to the, um, uh, plane of rotation
and it's pointing that way.

464
00:31:50,541 --> 00:31:51,410
So you'll get a,

465
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:56,180
an mz said components or components of
the magnetic moment along the zed axis.

466
00:31:56,390 --> 00:32:00,380
Here you can see immediately you've got
a component of the electric dipole along

467
00:32:00,381 --> 00:32:05,090
the zed axis. So that generates
a music and zed component,

468
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:09,040
uh, from this scale, a
product of mew, and then in,

469
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:10,850
in the rotational strength.

470
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:17,480
So this is a sort of making
a meal of it here now.

471
00:32:17,481 --> 00:32:22,481
So we're just putting down these so
called quantum mechanical matrix elements.

472
00:32:23,511 --> 00:32:28,511
So here we've got end to Pi Star with
little bit of that mixed in and that's

473
00:32:28,731 --> 00:32:33,620
fully magnetic dipole aloud.
Then we have end to Pi Star,

474
00:32:33,890 --> 00:32:36,140
which is forbidden electric dipole.

475
00:32:36,141 --> 00:32:40,970
But mixing that in gives you a
little bit of dipole character.

476
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:45,410
And so you now get a nonzero
contribution to the rotational strength.

477
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:49,070
However, you wouldn't want
to go, go on and, and,

478
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:54,190
and actually calculate the
optical rotation of the
carbon carbonyl chromophores

479
00:32:54,351 --> 00:32:57,290
in some situation from
this because as I said,

480
00:32:57,291 --> 00:33:01,880
there's many other excited electronic
states you could have also considered,

481
00:33:01,881 --> 00:33:03,880
which may be giving opposite,
um,

482
00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:06,980
contributions to the rotational strength.

483
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:09,440
You have to sum them all.

484
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:14,570
And to do that you now
have to go too modern, um,

485
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:17,480
ab initio quantum chemistry,

486
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:20,240
quantum chemical calculations.

487
00:33:20,570 --> 00:33:25,490
There's wonderful programs out now
or from galcion and Delta and you can

488
00:33:25,491 --> 00:33:29,930
calculate all sorts of molecular
properties with, with quite good,

489
00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:33,320
a very good accuracy in,
in many cases.

490
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:37,340
But this now turns it all into,
into a black box procedure.

491
00:33:37,341 --> 00:33:42,341
You just feed in appropriate
atomical befalls and press buttons.

492
00:33:43,431 --> 00:33:48,431
And turn handles whatever you do for
these calculations and out we'll pop some,

493
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:54,950
um, physical quantity. So, so you
can calculate this, this whole thing,

494
00:33:55,190 --> 00:34:00,110
ab initio and taking in a however
many excited states in the, in the,

495
00:34:00,111 --> 00:34:02,570
some are necessary and you can,

496
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:07,430
you can calculate that the size and
magnitude of the optical rotation for a

497
00:34:07,431 --> 00:34:10,010
given absolute configuration.
So you,

498
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:15,260
you would feed into the calculation
whether it's the s or the are absolute

499
00:34:15,921 --> 00:34:17,090
stereochemistry.

500
00:34:17,091 --> 00:34:21,620
So you'd put that in and that will
determine the sign of the optical rotation

501
00:34:21,621 --> 00:34:26,480
that comes out. And so, um, I
mean in this particular case,

502
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:27,500
this small molecule,

503
00:34:27,501 --> 00:34:32,180
the s absolute configuration goes with
the plus rotation and the Argos with the

504
00:34:32,181 --> 00:34:35,660
minus. Um, so from the calculation,

505
00:34:35,661 --> 00:34:40,661
then you can relate the sign of the
optical rotation to the absolute stereo

506
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,140
chemistry,

507
00:34:42,890 --> 00:34:47,570
but you wouldn't want to stake your
life on it because it's not completely

508
00:34:47,571 --> 00:34:51,800
reliable. You, it's usually gives the
right answer for smaller molecules,

509
00:34:51,801 --> 00:34:56,660
but not always. And for
example, if, if this was,

510
00:34:56,661 --> 00:34:58,760
um, uh, as, as you know,

511
00:34:58,761 --> 00:35:03,050
and I think you'll hear
more after my talk here,

512
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:04,333
um,

513
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:09,520
many drugs now are our chiral
and come drug companies,

514
00:35:09,891 --> 00:35:14,840
um, like to market now single
in TM aversions of the drug.

515
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:17,990
So it's a tremendously
important problem for them to,

516
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:23,710
to know with absolute certainty the
absolute configuration of the particular

517
00:35:25,281 --> 00:35:27,680
enantiomer their marketing because they,

518
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:32,330
if they make a mistake and specify the
wrong absolute configuration in their

519
00:35:32,331 --> 00:35:36,830
pattern, they can literally
lose billions of dollars. Um,

520
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:42,230
anyway, there's the, there's the famous,
the importance of, of Chi reality in,

521
00:35:42,231 --> 00:35:43,800
in drugs is,
uh,

522
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:47,790
exemplified by the famous
thalidomide the case.

523
00:35:47,791 --> 00:35:50,070
But I won't elaborate that anymore.

524
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:55,100
I think professor McBride is going to
tell you some more of that in more detail.

525
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:59,100
I should say that the,
the, the, the corner stone,

526
00:35:59,101 --> 00:36:04,101
the definitive method for determining
absolute configuration has for some years

527
00:36:04,201 --> 00:36:08,760
now been something called the by foot
method of anomalous x ray scattering,

528
00:36:08,761 --> 00:36:12,960
which again, professor, have you
told them about that? Yeah, yeah.

529
00:36:12,961 --> 00:36:14,340
That's the definitive method.

530
00:36:14,341 --> 00:36:17,610
But it's sort of cheating
because you're actually seeing,

531
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:21,180
you're seeing it through
through ex-ray eyes. Um,

532
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:25,560
but even then they can,
you can occasionally make mistakes,

533
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:30,740
but I should just mention also there are
some newer optical activity techniques

534
00:36:32,251 --> 00:36:36,090
involving something called vibration.
A lot to collectivity.

535
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:40,350
Here we've been looking at optical
activity in electronic transitions using

536
00:36:40,351 --> 00:36:43,110
visible light,
but in recent years,

537
00:36:43,111 --> 00:36:48,111
newer methods measuring up to connectivity
in vibrational transitions have come

538
00:36:48,421 --> 00:36:53,421
along and these are actually comparable
with ex-ray anomalous x ray scattering

539
00:36:53,881 --> 00:36:58,400
for reliability of absolute configuration.
That's because the,

540
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:02,580
these calculations are much more
reliable for this, these vibration,

541
00:37:02,581 --> 00:37:07,260
a lot to collectivity phenomena
than electronic months. Well,

542
00:37:07,290 --> 00:37:10,710
that's about it.
That's all I would like to say now.

543
00:37:10,711 --> 00:37:12,360
So thank you for listening.

544
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:18,190
[inaudible]

545
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:26,050
okay.

546
00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:26,883
Oh,

547
00:37:38,350 --> 00:37:43,350
I'm just wondering if the magnitude of
the faraday rotation can ever interfere

548
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:49,170
with the measurement of optical rotation
that the material that is to say

549
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:53,610
there's one situation polarimeter
and proximity to an Nmr spectrometer,

550
00:37:53,611 --> 00:37:54,720
for example.
Yeah,

551
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:58,150
no, I know you wouldn't need
to worry about that at all.

552
00:37:58,151 --> 00:38:03,151
Now you might need a reasonable strength
of magnetic field just applied directly

553
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:05,943
through the phone.

554
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:10,330
Yeah,
Lucas.

555
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:15,370
It's just in my understanding,
uh,

556
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:18,860
the end of high star is,
uh,

557
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:22,050
men are dying all loud electric
deputy forbidding [inaudible] to lie.

558
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:24,440
Then it goes too deep,
uh,

559
00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:29,370
at z as well in order to get in there.
That contribution.

560
00:38:29,790 --> 00:38:31,910
Yes.
Uh,

561
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,720
okay. Thanks. Good luck.

562
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:52,353
Thank you.

563
00:38:57,570 --> 00:38:59,910
So, uh, yeah,

564
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:03,500
this is just the plug,
this apple doing.

565
00:39:03,570 --> 00:39:08,120
The reason professor Beran is here as
he's the Tuttleman lecture and Jonathan

566
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:12,710
Edwards College, so he's giving a
talk for the history majors and so on.

567
00:39:12,711 --> 00:39:14,540
But it'll be very interesting for any,
why didn't,

568
00:39:14,541 --> 00:39:16,650
I think since we're into Chi rally,

569
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:20,720
you would enjoy this particularly this
afternoon and Davies Auditorium at five

570
00:39:20,721 --> 00:39:24,890
o'clock. But there's
the question, who cares?

571
00:39:25,970 --> 00:39:30,620
No offense, but who cares? Why
do we care about ty rally? Well,

572
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:35,210
the professor Beran hinted at it. Living
thing is care because they're Tyrell,

573
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:38,600
right? So which one they react with. Okay.

574
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:42,800
The Food and Drug Administration cares
for the same reason with respect to

575
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:47,780
medications. You might be taking
drug companies care a lot.

576
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:52,280
And there are lawyers and the
u s patent office care a lot,

577
00:39:53,450 --> 00:39:57,530
right? Which is generated the
thing called a chiral switch.

578
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:00,990
Most drugs that used to be developed
were developed as Rasamayi.

579
00:40:00,990 --> 00:40:03,650
It's cause it was difficult
to separate the two hands.

580
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:09,580
But if your patent runs
out on the Rasamayi and you
can resolve it and now sell

581
00:40:10,251 --> 00:40:11,180
just one of them,

582
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:16,550
and if it's better and the
FDA will approve it and you
can convince people that

583
00:40:16,551 --> 00:40:18,020
that's the one they should buy,

584
00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:22,190
then you can go back to not having to
compete with generic drug companies

585
00:40:22,191 --> 00:40:27,000
anymore in charge.
$5 a pill instead of 50 cents a pill died.

586
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:31,820
So this so-called called chiral switch to
go from receiving mic to a single lane.

587
00:40:31,821 --> 00:40:36,680
And humor is a big movement nowadays.
For example, consider this pain reliever.

588
00:40:36,681 --> 00:40:39,950
Let's figure out what it is.
Do you remember what that group is?

589
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:44,990
Four carbons in that sort of Mercedes
structure. You know what that,

590
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:47,990
what that group's called this the this.

591
00:40:47,991 --> 00:40:50,110
What we're doing for the rest of
the lecture here, however it is,

592
00:40:50,330 --> 00:40:53,990
is actually review for the exam on Friday.

593
00:40:54,170 --> 00:40:58,820
You're not specifically responsible for
it, but it's review. So we know that group

594
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:03,430
isobutyl.
Okay.

595
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:06,990
And what acid is that with three carbons?
Do you know

596
00:41:08,450 --> 00:41:12,560
the first fatty acid?
Propionic acid.

597
00:41:13,610 --> 00:41:18,140
And in the middle we have
fennel group.

598
00:41:18,650 --> 00:41:22,190
Okay.
So what's the name of the drug?

599
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:32,720
Sherwin.
Ibuprofen.

600
00:41:33,350 --> 00:41:34,010
Advil or

601
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:38,510
Motrin. Okay. Now in this case you
have a chiral center there, right?

602
00:41:38,511 --> 00:41:40,580
Cause there's a hydrogen
on there that we don't see.

603
00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:44,870
And the [inaudible] is the pain
reliever it said to be. So anyhow.

604
00:41:44,871 --> 00:41:49,610
And the R is inactive. Right?
But it's marketed as Uracil mate.

605
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:50,870
Right.

606
00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:55,760
One might try doing a chiral switch and
selling only the s but the trouble is

607
00:41:55,761 --> 00:41:58,190
that it very quickly rast
summize is inside you.

608
00:41:58,191 --> 00:42:00,290
So it wouldn't be doing any good.
Right?

609
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:03,620
Cause you'd do all the work of selling
the s and then it would become our

610
00:42:03,621 --> 00:42:06,410
immediately when you eat it.
And here's another one.

611
00:42:06,411 --> 00:42:08,570
This is the one that professor
Beran was referred to,

612
00:42:08,571 --> 00:42:10,880
which is a sedative Felita MyEd.

613
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:15,080
And there's the chiral center in that
one because there's an h on there.

614
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:20,490
So the s form is a sedative, but the r
form, at least it said is to ride engine,

615
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:26,110
which means it makes monsters and it's
not so funny because it was sold as

616
00:42:27,231 --> 00:42:32,120
Uracil mate from 1957 to 62 and never
in the u s because the FDA didn't,

617
00:42:32,530 --> 00:42:34,850
they were lucky it never approved it.

618
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:40,220
But in Europe it caused 10,000 birth
defects. Children born without arms out,

619
00:42:40,221 --> 00:42:43,670
legs, things like that.
So it was a tragedy. Uh,

620
00:42:43,950 --> 00:42:48,860
but this one also undergoes in
Vivo Rassam causation. Okay.

621
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:51,590
These you can find rate
constants for these.

622
00:42:51,591 --> 00:42:55,970
It's curious that the rate of ESCO into
our and the rate of are going to s are

623
00:42:55,971 --> 00:42:59,330
not the same. It must, there must,
there's got to be more to it than that,

624
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:02,810
but one has to be more stable than
the other of these mirror images.

625
00:43:02,811 --> 00:43:06,770
If that's true, it may be that the
rates aren't exactly true, but if so,

626
00:43:06,771 --> 00:43:10,790
they must be bound to something that
makes chiral that makes one of the more

627
00:43:10,791 --> 00:43:14,360
stable than the other. Anyhow, that's
how fast they go back and forth.

628
00:43:14,870 --> 00:43:17,450
And this is how fast they
get eliminated from the body.

629
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:20,060
One gets eliminated much
faster than the other.

630
00:43:20,270 --> 00:43:21,680
And if you put these things together,

631
00:43:21,681 --> 00:43:26,030
you can see how the concentration should
vary with time if it's going according

632
00:43:26,031 --> 00:43:28,010
to that rates.
So the blue one,

633
00:43:28,011 --> 00:43:31,490
the one that's good for you
quickly drops off the bad one.

634
00:43:31,491 --> 00:43:33,410
The Toronto region grows quickly,

635
00:43:33,590 --> 00:43:38,570
so you have maybe two hours of 24 hours
where you've got a lot more of the good

636
00:43:38,571 --> 00:43:43,250
ones and the bad one. So essentially
this drug is completely off limits,

637
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:47,840
especially for any women that could
conceivably under any circumstances be

638
00:43:47,841 --> 00:43:50,990
pregnant. Okay. So, uh,

639
00:43:51,110 --> 00:43:55,730
but it's a wonderful drug for things
like leprosy and so on. Uh, uh,

640
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:00,350
David here is a MD as well
as the professor of chemistry
and he'd probably know

641
00:44:00,351 --> 00:44:03,050
more about that, but it's a wonderful
drug for certain things in that, right?

642
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:06,860
That's right. That's right. It's still
actually in common usage for anxiety.

643
00:44:07,470 --> 00:44:11,360
But there are all sorts of warnings
and letters this big about if you're,

644
00:44:11,390 --> 00:44:14,510
if you have a chance of getting pregnant,
stay away from this baby, right?

645
00:44:15,310 --> 00:44:20,290
If you're a male patient taking it and
your wife is pregnant or likely to become

646
00:44:20,330 --> 00:44:23,090
pregnant, you're encouraged
not to take it. Wow.

647
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:28,550
Wow. Okay, so now here's, here's a drug.

648
00:44:28,551 --> 00:44:31,920
We're going to look up the name of this
one. It's a really cooperative a name,

649
00:44:31,921 --> 00:44:36,300
right? So let's just use this as a
practice about nomenclature. Okay,

650
00:44:36,301 --> 00:44:38,970
so that thing there is called amid all,

651
00:44:39,270 --> 00:44:44,190
and the one h tells where,
which one has a hydrogen on it,

652
00:44:44,370 --> 00:44:48,780
right? Okay. So that's the position
one. And that is the benzene ring.

653
00:44:48,781 --> 00:44:53,730
So Ben, so it's bins of Midazolam. That
group on the right and you number it.

654
00:44:53,731 --> 00:44:56,910
Remember it was one age,
there's an h on the nitrogen one there,

655
00:44:57,030 --> 00:45:01,440
and you go around the ring a number
in that conventional way. Okay? Now,

656
00:45:01,470 --> 00:45:04,040
but then you notice that
there's something on the,

657
00:45:04,190 --> 00:45:07,620
on the number five and there's
something on the number two carbons,

658
00:45:07,621 --> 00:45:11,100
have that ring on five.
There's a meth oxy group,

659
00:45:11,310 --> 00:45:15,000
which appears first among all the
things in this [inaudible] named here,

660
00:45:15,030 --> 00:45:19,380
not the thing that's on to why
is the methoxy group first,

661
00:45:19,950 --> 00:45:21,840
do you remember what the rule is?

662
00:45:25,150 --> 00:45:27,670
How do you arrange the substituent groups?

663
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:33,380
Angela Alphabetically?

664
00:45:33,390 --> 00:45:35,450
Amazon's going to be the first one.
Okay.

665
00:45:35,451 --> 00:45:40,451
So five methoxy and then two is so final
that s with an o audit is called soul

666
00:45:41,031 --> 00:45:43,610
final group. Okay. So it's two, so final,

667
00:45:43,611 --> 00:45:47,360
but now there are all sorts of curly
brackets in square brackets and so on to

668
00:45:47,361 --> 00:45:51,500
tell what's attached to that. Okay.
So attached to that is uh, uh,

669
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:56,090
is methyl group, but the methyl is
substituted. So its methyl, so final.

670
00:45:56,420 --> 00:46:00,080
Okay. That's the, that's the, uh,
currently the square brackets. Okay.

671
00:46:00,081 --> 00:46:01,370
Now what's on the methyl,

672
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:05,270
there's a purity in group that benzene
with a nitrogen at this parody in and

673
00:46:05,271 --> 00:46:08,750
it's substituted on the
methyl at its own to position.

674
00:46:09,050 --> 00:46:12,980
The two position to the purity in is
what's attached to the methyl. So it's uh,

675
00:46:13,070 --> 00:46:16,310
so it's two para dental,
the end,

676
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:21,340
but now on that in the four position is
methoxy and methoxy comes alphabetically

677
00:46:21,711 --> 00:46:26,360
before methyl, not before d but before
methyl. And you don't count the die,

678
00:46:26,630 --> 00:46:30,500
right? So there's the name of that
compound and this stuff is a drug.

679
00:46:30,501 --> 00:46:32,840
It's a gastric proton pump inhibitor.

680
00:46:32,841 --> 00:46:37,841
So it treats acid reflux disease and
it's the world's largest selling drug in

681
00:46:38,331 --> 00:46:41,030
the year 2006 point $2 billion.

682
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:44,690
And it's called a MEP
Rizal or [inaudible] Sec.

683
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:49,630
And you've seen probably some of you at
least have seen boxes of [inaudible] sac.

684
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:52,580
I don't, you hope you don't have
to take it like I do occasionally.

685
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:58,280
This is called OTC. We're going to be
talking about that on Monday. Okay.

686
00:46:58,281 --> 00:47:00,440
So there it is.
Now get your glasses up

687
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:07,400
because can you see this it,

688
00:47:07,430 --> 00:47:09,560
can you see any sort of
three dimensions here?

689
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:14,900
What's in front or what's behind?
Can anybody tell?

690
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:21,110
Do you have any luck and see it in three
dimensions? Some people can't see it,

691
00:47:21,111 --> 00:47:23,900
but most of you,
like 95% of you shouldn't be able to see.

692
00:47:24,430 --> 00:47:28,120
It's not a really high quality
three dimensions and the,

693
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:29,830
because the computer,

694
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:33,180
the projector doesn't do it
exactly right for the colors.

695
00:47:33,181 --> 00:47:37,390
So one IC is only wanted one sees
all of the other. Anybody see? Okay.

696
00:47:37,391 --> 00:47:41,410
Now what is chiral here?
Can you see why this thing is chiral?

697
00:47:41,411 --> 00:47:43,720
There's no carbon with four
different things on it,

698
00:47:45,170 --> 00:47:48,630
but what makes it hand it?
Can you see?

699
00:47:49,250 --> 00:47:51,580
In fact there's no group that
has four different things on it.

700
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:56,660
Any suggestions?
Uh,

701
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:01,330
Lucas sulfur sulfur has an unshared pair,

702
00:48:01,331 --> 00:48:04,720
an oxygen and two different
art groups and which,

703
00:48:04,721 --> 00:48:06,420
which is pointed out toward you.
Okay.

704
00:48:06,490 --> 00:48:09,850
Can you see it enough in three dimensions
with the glasses to see that to see

705
00:48:09,851 --> 00:48:12,900
which is pointing out Paris?
Yeah,

706
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:15,010
it's the unshared pair
that's pointing out.

707
00:48:15,011 --> 00:48:18,610
So if you use your thumbs and not
recognize that the unshared pair has the

708
00:48:18,611 --> 00:48:21,700
lowest atomic number, zero, right,

709
00:48:21,970 --> 00:48:24,880
then you could do it and you'll find out
that that particular when drawn there

710
00:48:24,881 --> 00:48:27,580
is the s e a n d A. Umer. Okay.

711
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,300
So it's normally a map resolve.

712
00:48:31,350 --> 00:48:34,790
[inaudible] Prosecco,
OTC are the Rasamayi.

713
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:39,730
But this one that's drawn here is
the s isomer and it's called what

714
00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:44,950
asset map? Rizal. That's
the name of it. Right?

715
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:50,200
And or Nexium. Right?
And it's the s isomer,

716
00:48:50,620 --> 00:48:51,040
right?

717
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:54,670
So this is the product of one of these
chiral switches where for a long time the

718
00:48:54,671 --> 00:48:59,090
stuff was marketed as harassing rate
and now they market it as a single

719
00:48:59,270 --> 00:49:02,140
antitumor Nexium.
And we tried this one last time,

720
00:49:02,141 --> 00:49:05,140
so we're not going to spend
time on it right now. Uh,

721
00:49:05,141 --> 00:49:07,420
that's what the class looks
like when they're doing this.

722
00:49:07,421 --> 00:49:10,100
It's fun for me to see you.
Okay.

723
00:49:10,690 --> 00:49:14,080
But there are other ways of doing the
stereo view and you can use Paris,

724
00:49:14,110 --> 00:49:18,910
a pair of periscopes like this, right?
And the way that works, of course,

725
00:49:19,230 --> 00:49:22,270
the point is for each eye
to see a different image.

726
00:49:22,271 --> 00:49:24,520
So if you want to try those
and look at this after class,

727
00:49:24,820 --> 00:49:28,270
feel free or borrow them. A few
wish. Right? So, so what, uh,

728
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:31,960
what the eyes perceive as a super
position in the middle. It's like this.

729
00:49:31,961 --> 00:49:35,500
There are two pictures, but, and
if you can do it with the glasses,

730
00:49:35,530 --> 00:49:37,900
you can do it probably just
by looking at this picture.

731
00:49:37,901 --> 00:49:40,900
If you have a little while, but we don't
have the little while now the right,

732
00:49:40,901 --> 00:49:44,250
I will see that the left eye will see
that. And you see in the middle there,

733
00:49:44,251 --> 00:49:48,730
see the something in the same position
but in slightly different projections.

734
00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:53,620
So, so the image in the middle of the
three seems seems to be in three d.

735
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:57,130
Okay. Now, uh,

736
00:49:57,131 --> 00:50:00,990
we don't have time to go [inaudible]
we're going to do a lot of a curved Arrow

737
00:50:00,991 --> 00:50:05,200
staff about how reactions
happen in making a map resolve.

738
00:50:05,470 --> 00:50:07,920
And then even more
interesting in the action of,

739
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:10,420
of map resolve that
stops the stomach acid.

740
00:50:10,421 --> 00:50:13,030
But we'll have to wait until
after the exam for that. Okay.

741
00:50:13,031 --> 00:50:14,480
Thanks again to professor Beran.

742
00:50:15,230 --> 00:50:18,370
[inaudible].
