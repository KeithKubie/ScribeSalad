00:00:00.629 --> 00:00:04.317
- [Voiceover] So, right
over here, we have the graph

00:00:04.317 --> 00:00:08.828
of the function y is equal
to x to the 3/2 power.

00:00:08.828 --> 00:00:13.828
And what I wanna do is find
the arc length of this curve,

00:00:14.811 --> 00:00:18.520
from when x equals zero
to when x is equal to--

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.651
and I'm gonna pick a strange number here,

00:00:20.651 --> 00:00:21.693
and I picked this strange number

00:00:21.693 --> 00:00:23.923
'cause it makes the numbers
work out very well--

00:00:23.923 --> 00:00:26.740
to x is equal to 32/9.

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.428
32/9 is, let's see...

00:00:28.428 --> 00:00:33.428
That's three and 5/9, so
it's gonna be right around...

00:00:35.815 --> 00:00:37.976
So that's three and 1/2, so
it's gonna be a little bit

00:00:37.976 --> 00:00:41.801
past three and 1/2, so it's
gonna be right over there.

00:00:41.801 --> 00:00:46.801
So we wanna find this arc
length right over here,

00:00:47.222 --> 00:00:49.764
this thing that I have depicted in yellow.

00:00:49.764 --> 00:00:54.155
So it's from zero to 32/9.

00:00:54.155 --> 00:00:55.949
And I encourage you to pause the video

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.788
and try this out on your own.

00:00:58.788 --> 00:01:00.055
So I'm assuming you've had a go at it.

00:01:00.055 --> 00:01:01.702
And if at any point while
I'm working through it,

00:01:01.702 --> 00:01:05.128
you feel inspired, always
feel free to pause the video

00:01:05.128 --> 00:01:07.519
and continue working with it.

00:01:07.519 --> 00:01:09.734
So let's just apply the arc length formula

00:01:09.734 --> 00:01:13.155
that we got kind of a conceptual proof for

00:01:13.155 --> 00:01:15.592
in the previous video.

00:01:15.592 --> 00:01:17.691
So we know that the arc length...

00:01:17.691 --> 00:01:18.375
Let me write this.

00:01:18.375 --> 00:01:23.375
The arc length is going to be
equal to the definite integral

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:30.609
from zero to 32/9 of the square root...

00:01:32.185 --> 00:01:35.475
Actually, let me just write
it in general terms first,

00:01:35.475 --> 00:01:38.694
so that you can kinda see the
formula and then how we apply it.

00:01:38.694 --> 00:01:43.694
So, it's the square root of one
plus f-prime of x squared d x.

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:50.920
And in this case, it's going
to be the definite integral

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.920
from zero to 32/9 of the
square root of one plus...

00:02:00.511 --> 00:02:01.557
Now, what's the derivative?

00:02:01.557 --> 00:02:06.557
If f of x is x to the 3/2,
then f-prime of x is going

00:02:09.052 --> 00:02:13.135
to be 3/2 x to the 1/2.

00:02:13.135 --> 00:02:15.128
And we picked this particular function

00:02:15.128 --> 00:02:18.426
because it simplifies
quite well when we put it

00:02:18.426 --> 00:02:20.690
under the radical, and
it's fairly straightforward

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.513
to find the anti-derivative.

00:02:22.513 --> 00:02:24.946
So we've done a lot of
engineering of this problem

00:02:24.946 --> 00:02:26.394
to make the numbers work out well,

00:02:26.394 --> 00:02:27.797
but let's just go through it.

00:02:27.797 --> 00:02:32.517
So this is f-prime of x;
f-prime of x squared is going

00:02:32.517 --> 00:02:33.984
to be this quantity squared.

00:02:33.984 --> 00:02:38.600
It's going to be 9/4 x
to the 1/2 squared is x.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.600
So, one plus 9/4 x d x.

00:02:43.716 --> 00:02:45.850
And so, now, we just
have a definite integral

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:48.323
that we know how to
solve this type of thing.

00:02:48.323 --> 00:02:50.589
And you might be able to
even do this in your head,

00:02:50.589 --> 00:02:52.241
essentially, do the u-substitution:

00:02:52.241 --> 00:02:54.583
say I have one plus 9/4 x.

00:02:54.583 --> 00:02:56.297
Its derivative is 9/4.

00:02:56.297 --> 00:02:58.895
I can kind of engineer that if I want,

00:02:58.895 --> 00:03:02.393
but instead, I'm just going to
do straight up u-substitution.

00:03:02.393 --> 00:03:07.393
So, if I say u is equal to one plus 9/4 x,

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:11.610
then we know...

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:12.830
Let's see.

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:17.830
D u d x is going to be equal to 9/4.

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:24.579
Or, we could say d u is equal to 9/4 d x.

00:03:24.808 --> 00:03:28.094
Or, we could say d x...

00:03:28.094 --> 00:03:30.180
Let me scroll down a little bit.

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.438
We could say d x is equal to...

00:03:32.438 --> 00:03:36.149
I'm just gonna multiply
both sides times 4/9.

00:03:36.149 --> 00:03:38.854
Let's go to 4/9 d u.

00:03:38.854 --> 00:03:41.487
And then we just have to change
the bounds of integration.

00:03:41.487 --> 00:03:46.487
When x is equal to zero, then
u is going to be equal to...

00:03:48.781 --> 00:03:51.262
9/4 times zero is just zero, so u is going

00:03:51.262 --> 00:03:52.936
to be equal to one.

00:03:52.936 --> 00:03:57.936
And when x is equal to 32/9--

00:03:59.975 --> 00:04:01.458
and this is why that number was picked--

00:04:01.458 --> 00:04:03.602
what's u going to be equal to?

00:04:03.602 --> 00:04:07.936
32/9 times 9/4 is gonna be 32/4,

00:04:07.936 --> 00:04:09.992
which is going to be eight plus one.

00:04:09.992 --> 00:04:13.011
So that worked out very
nicely; imagine that.

00:04:13.011 --> 00:04:13.797
So there we have it.

00:04:13.797 --> 00:04:17.636
So, this is going to be equal
to the definite integral...

00:04:17.636 --> 00:04:18.998
Actually, let me make
it clear that this is

00:04:18.998 --> 00:04:20.349
what is equal to this.

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:25.349
The definite integral
from u is equal to one,

00:04:25.517 --> 00:04:27.589
to u is equal to 9--

00:04:27.589 --> 00:04:28.922
I'm gonna make it very
explicit that I'm dealing

00:04:28.922 --> 00:04:30.839
with u now--

00:04:30.839 --> 00:04:35.488
of the square root of u.

00:04:35.488 --> 00:04:40.152
And instead of d x, we
have d x is 4/9 d u.

00:04:40.152 --> 00:04:43.760
Let me do it this way: the square root...

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.909
Whoops, that's not the right color.

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:50.909
Square root of u; instead of
d x, we have times 4/9 d u.

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:57.880
And I'm just gonna take the
4/9 and stick it out here.

00:04:58.178 --> 00:05:01.597
And we know how to apply the fundamental,

00:05:01.597 --> 00:05:04.329
or, I guess, the second fundamental
theorem of calculus here,

00:05:04.329 --> 00:05:06.663
to evaluate this definite integral.

00:05:06.663 --> 00:05:11.663
This is going to be 4/9
times the anti-derivative

00:05:12.446 --> 00:05:15.030
of the square root of u,
which is the same thing

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:16.551
as u to the 1/2.

00:05:16.551 --> 00:05:19.564
It's going to be u to the
3/2, and then we divide

00:05:19.564 --> 00:05:23.204
by 3/2, which is the same
thing as multiplying by 2/3.

00:05:23.204 --> 00:05:26.371
We're going to evaluate
that at u equals nine

00:05:26.371 --> 00:05:28.886
and u is equal to one.

00:05:28.886 --> 00:05:31.427
And so, we're in the home stretch here.

00:05:31.427 --> 00:05:36.427
This is going to be equal
to 4/9 times 2/3 times 9

00:05:41.641 --> 00:05:46.641
to the 3/2 minus 2/3 times one to the 3/2.

00:05:49.636 --> 00:05:52.119
So, 9 to the 3/2, that is...

00:05:52.119 --> 00:05:54.724
Let's see: the square
root of nine is three,

00:05:54.724 --> 00:05:57.302
to the third power is 27.

00:05:57.302 --> 00:05:59.352
And this, of course, is one.

00:05:59.352 --> 00:06:03.436
So we are left with 2/3 of...

00:06:03.436 --> 00:06:04.920
Actually, let's just factor out the 2/3,

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:07.117
that makes it easier.

00:06:07.117 --> 00:06:12.117
This is going to be equal to
2/3 times 4/9 is equal to 8/27.

00:06:15.355 --> 00:06:17.176
I've just factored out the 2/3.

00:06:17.176 --> 00:06:19.777
And then we're gonna have 27 minus one

00:06:19.777 --> 00:06:23.274
inside, I guess you could
say the brackets now.

00:06:23.274 --> 00:06:28.274
So 27 minus one is just going to be 26.

00:06:29.803 --> 00:06:32.157
Times 26.

00:06:32.157 --> 00:06:36.212
And we could obviously
simplify this more if we want.

00:06:36.212 --> 00:06:39.173
Eight times 26 is...

00:06:39.173 --> 00:06:41.154
So, actually, let's just
figure that out, just for fun.

00:06:41.154 --> 00:06:42.792
So, eight times 26 is going

00:06:42.792 --> 00:06:47.792
to be 160 plus eight times six
is 48, so it's 208 over 27.

00:06:56.910 --> 00:07:01.910
And we are done.
