00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.710
you

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720
 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.740
well I think certainly some incumbents

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750
well I think certainly some incumbents
 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.259
well I think certainly some incumbents
are in danger although I think that some

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269
are in danger although I think that some
 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:18.830
are in danger although I think that some
of the media characterization of the

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840
of the media characterization of the
 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.290
of the media characterization of the
election as an anti-incumbent wave has

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300
election as an anti-incumbent wave has
 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.099
election as an anti-incumbent wave has
been overblown the fact is that in all

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109
been overblown the fact is that in all
 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:26.750
been overblown the fact is that in all
of these primary elections so far only

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760
of these primary elections so far only
 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.849
of these primary elections so far only
one house incumbent has actually been

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859
one house incumbent has actually been
 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.659
one house incumbent has actually been
defeated one and two Senate incumbents

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669
defeated one and two Senate incumbents
 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.970
defeated one and two Senate incumbents
but in both of those cases I think there

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980
but in both of those cases I think there
 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.070
but in both of those cases I think there
were actually special reasons behind

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:37.080
were actually special reasons behind
 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.840
were actually special reasons behind
their losses I mean Arlen Specter

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850
their losses I mean Arlen Specter
 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.569
their losses I mean Arlen Specter
switched parties about a year before the

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579
switched parties about a year before the
 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.529
switched parties about a year before the
election and really gave Democrats very

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539
election and really gave Democrats very
 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.709
election and really gave Democrats very
little reason to vote for him here's a

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719
little reason to vote for him here's a
 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.270
little reason to vote for him here's a
guy who'd been a Republican all of his

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280
guy who'd been a Republican all of his
 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.310
guy who'd been a Republican all of his
career Democrats in Pennsylvania were

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320
career Democrats in Pennsylvania were
 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.580
career Democrats in Pennsylvania were
used to voting against him he switches

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590
used to voting against him he switches
 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.920
used to voting against him he switches
parties and basically the rationale he

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930
parties and basically the rationale he
 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.510
parties and basically the rationale he
gives is that well I needed to do this

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520
gives is that well I needed to do this
 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.349
gives is that well I needed to do this
to survive so you know I think there

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359
to survive so you know I think there
 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.620
to survive so you know I think there
that it had more to do with the

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630
that it had more to do with the
 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.450
that it had more to do with the
particular circumstances of part the

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460
particular circumstances of part the
 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.760
particular circumstances of part the
party switching by Arlen Specter and you

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770
party switching by Arlen Specter and you
 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.180
party switching by Arlen Specter and you
know then in the the the Utah case you

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:17.190
know then in the the the Utah case you
 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:19.820
know then in the the the Utah case you
know you had not a primary election but

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830
know you had not a primary election but
 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.839
know you had not a primary election but
a very small party convention dominated

00:01:23.839 --> 00:01:23.849
a very small party convention dominated
 

00:01:23.849 --> 00:01:26.270
a very small party convention dominated
by the most conservative activists in

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280
by the most conservative activists in
 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.919
by the most conservative activists in
the Republican Party in Utah which is a

00:01:27.919 --> 00:01:27.929
the Republican Party in Utah which is a
 

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:29.600
the Republican Party in Utah which is a
pretty conservative state to begin with

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610
pretty conservative state to begin with
 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.999
pretty conservative state to begin with
so I just wouldn't want to read too much

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009
so I just wouldn't want to read too much
 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.300
so I just wouldn't want to read too much
you know into that now there's no

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310
you know into that now there's no
 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.930
you know into that now there's no
question when voters are discontented

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:40.940
question when voters are discontented
 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:44.210
question when voters are discontented
over the economy and the state of the

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220
over the economy and the state of the
 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.050
over the economy and the state of the
country that they tend to vote against

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060
country that they tend to vote against
 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.389
country that they tend to vote against
the party in power and so in addition to

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399
the party in power and so in addition to
 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:54.620
the party in power and so in addition to
the fact that it's a midterm election

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630
the fact that it's a midterm election
 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.779
the fact that it's a midterm election
and the president's party almost always

00:01:56.779 --> 00:01:56.789
and the president's party almost always
 

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:58.430
and the president's party almost always
you know loses seats in midterm

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:58.440
you know loses seats in midterm
 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.540
you know loses seats in midterm
elections and the Democrats are in a

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:01.550
elections and the Democrats are in a
 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:05.210
elections and the Democrats are in a
rather defensive posture anyway because

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220
rather defensive posture anyway because
 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.249
rather defensive posture anyway because
they've picked up so many seats in the

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259
they've picked up so many seats in the
 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.869
they've picked up so many seats in the
last two elections many of which are

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879
last two elections many of which are
 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.540
last two elections many of which are
actually in Republican territory you

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550
actually in Republican territory you
 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.930
actually in Republican territory you
know so you've got a lot of Democratic

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940
know so you've got a lot of Democratic
 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.260
know so you've got a lot of Democratic
incumbents running this year who are

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270
incumbents running this year who are
 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.860
incumbents running this year who are
representing states and districts that

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870
representing states and districts that
 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.080
representing states and districts that
you know have usually voted Republican

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090
you know have usually voted Republican
 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.160
you know have usually voted Republican
in the past so my expectation is that

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170
in the past so my expectation is that
 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.710
in the past so my expectation is that
the Democrats will lose a substantial

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720
the Democrats will lose a substantial
 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.600
the Democrats will lose a substantial
number of seats and and so you know

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610
number of seats and and so you know
 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.970
number of seats and and so you know
quite a few Democratic incumbents will

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980
quite a few Democratic incumbents will
 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.030
quite a few Democratic incumbents will
lose but that's more a reflection of

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040
lose but that's more a reflection of
 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.520
lose but that's more a reflection of
just the normal kind of partisan swings

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530
just the normal kind of partisan swings
 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.559
just the normal kind of partisan swings
that we see in elections and especially

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:40.569
that we see in elections and especially
 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:42.380
that we see in elections and especially
in midterm elections rather than any

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390
in midterm elections rather than any
 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.259
in midterm elections rather than any
unusual level of voter anger and

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269
unusual level of voter anger and
 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:50.880
unusual level of voter anger and
moreover I think it's very misleading I

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890
moreover I think it's very misleading I
 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.930
moreover I think it's very misleading I
think to try to read too much into the

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940
think to try to read too much into the
 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.490
think to try to read too much into the
results of these primary elections or

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500
results of these primary elections or
 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.110
results of these primary elections or
special elections that have been taking

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120
special elections that have been taking
 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.210
special elections that have been taking
place you know I think that is a

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220
place you know I think that is a
 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.069
place you know I think that is a
tendency on the part of the media often

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:02.079
tendency on the part of the media often
 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:05.119
tendency on the part of the media often
to over-interpret you know the latest

00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:05.129
to over-interpret you know the latest
 

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:08.520
to over-interpret you know the latest
event whatever just happened is always

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530
event whatever just happened is always
 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:09.809
event whatever just happened is always
the most important thing that's ever

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:09.819
the most important thing that's ever
 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:11.670
the most important thing that's ever
happened we saw this during the

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680
happened we saw this during the
 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.199
happened we saw this during the
presidential campaign you know both the

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209

when that when that event happened oh
 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:22.050
when that when that event happened oh

that was the end of Obama's candidacy
 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.870
that was the end of Obama's candidacy

the general election campaign all the
furor over surrounding the choice of

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739
furor over surrounding the choice of
 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:31.289
furor over surrounding the choice of
Sarah Palin as John McCain's running

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:31.299
Sarah Palin as John McCain's running
 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:32.940
Sarah Palin as John McCain's running

mate well that turned out to be
 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.129
mate well that turned out to be
overblown you know so I think we're

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:35.139
overblown you know so I think we're
 

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:37.289
overblown you know so I think we're
seeing the same thing this year every

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:37.299
seeing the same thing this year every
 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:39.690
seeing the same thing this year every
time some new interesting event takes

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700
time some new interesting event takes
 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.670
time some new interesting event takes
place whether it's a incumbent losing in

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680
place whether it's a incumbent losing in
 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.920
place whether it's a incumbent losing in
a primary you know or special election

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930
a primary you know or special election
 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.039
a primary you know or special election
outcome the media jump on that and and

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:47.049
outcome the media jump on that and and
 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:49.439
outcome the media jump on that and and
try to read you know into that some

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:49.449
try to read you know into that some
 

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:51.449
try to read you know into that some
great significance for what's going to

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:51.459
great significance for what's going to
 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:55.460
great significance for what's going to
happen in November I think that that is

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470
happen in November I think that that is
 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:03.460
happen in November I think that that is
really overblown

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470
 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:05.530
you
