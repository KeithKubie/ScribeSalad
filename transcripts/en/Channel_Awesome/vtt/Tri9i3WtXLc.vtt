00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.220
Hello, I'm the Nostalgia Critic. I remember it so you don't have to.

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:08.820
Well, I've gotten emails, and emails, and emails,

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.420
and emails of people requesting me to do this one certain movie.

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:17.720
Well, today, I'm finally gonna give in. This is it.

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:21.700
One of the big ones. One of the worst ones ever.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.040
I am going to review The Room.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.180
That's right, the college film that I made growing up.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.440
I'm surprised you guys want me to review this so bad.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.060
I mean, it's not very long and I made it years ago.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.920
But ever since I showed it in my flashbacks section, you've all requested me to do it.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.300
So, let's not waste any time. Let's dive right into--

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:43.720
Critic!

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:44.680
Who are you?

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.340
I'm you, from the future.

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.000
Well, what are you doing here, or am I doing here, or what are we doing here?

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.540
This isn't the movie they want you to review, Critic.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.500
There's one worse. Far worse, that they say is one of the worst movies of all time.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.520
Really? Oh, that is tempting. When was it made?

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.320
All the way in 2003.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.200
But that's after my cut-off date. That's barely nostalgic.

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:14.540
I know! That's why I've come to take you into the future, so that it will be nostalgic!

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:18.000
Aw, but I wanted to review my old college movie. It was gonna be funny.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:18.940
No, it wasn't.

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:19.680
Yes it was.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.140
What, were you gonna use another Chuck Norris joke again?

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:23.080
Maybe.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.480
Come on, Critic! There's no time to lose!

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.320
Wow.

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.120
So what year is this?

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.460
The future!

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.740
All right, all right, but why am I downstairs in the basement?

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.580
It's the only place we can hide to stay away from the seahorses.

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:43.720
Oh, okay.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:48.140
What?

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.360
Seahorses rule the earth now. Complete domination. Surprised nobody saw it coming, really.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.740
Well, I'll just deal with that as it comes.

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.340
So, let's now waste any time. Let's dive right into The Room.

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:20.660
Okay, so after we get our logo that looks like it should be before a TurboGrafx-16 game,

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:25.080
we cut to our opening credits. We get some fairly decent shots of San Francisco

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.620
as we see the star of our movie is Tommy Wiseau.

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.360
Who I guess was also the executive producer.

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:33.920
And the writer.

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.060
And the producer again.

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.440
Gee, either the director of this film really likes Tommy Wiseau or,

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.880
prfft, I'm just going to go out on a limb here and say

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.700
yeah, just as I thought.

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.840
Looks like we a have a personal story here, people. Be very afraid.

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.240
Hi babe.

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.540
I have something for you.

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.500
Okay, no, no, no,

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.800
come on, come on, where's the real performance?

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.140
The bank saves money, and they are using me, and I am the fool.

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.720
No, seriously guys, come on, where's the real actor?

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.500
You are part of my life. You are everything. I could not go on without you, Lisa.

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:24.140
No.

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.000
What about Elizabeth, huh?

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.380
No.

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.980
Let me guess, that's Tommy Wiseau?

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:32.580
Oh, no.

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:38.660
That's the kind of acting they only talk about in fairytales! The kind of acting that they say could never exist!

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.080
Don't do it, Critic!

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.300
Obscurus Lupa?

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:46.600
I've reviewed this movie already. There's no need for you to sacrifice your sanity as well!

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:47.880
I must, Lupa!

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.680
True, it will be hard to sit through this anus of a performance,

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.680
but I must do it for my fans!

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.960
(sobs) Why, Critic?

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:56.020
AWAY WITH YOU!

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:03.140
So yeah, this is our main character, everybody.

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:06.480
You know that creepy guy who always looks at you funny on the subway?

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.800
Yeah, he made a movie, apparently!

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.800
And in that movie he plays Johnny,

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.540
the fiancee of a pretty young woman named Lisa.

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:16.980
- Oh, hey guys!
- Oh hai Denny.

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.580
And this is Denny. We don't know that much about him,

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:22.120
but after a few scenes you'll wish it'd stay that way.

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:23.560
Nice to see you, Denny.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:25.880
I'm going to take a nap.

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:27.600
Can I go upstairs too?

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.320
Denny, I think I'm gonna join him.

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:35.840
So, a kid comes over and they go upstairs to have sex?

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:38.800
That's kinda rude! What's the kid supposed to do?

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.980
I mean, is he supposed to just go upstairs and join them?

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.420
Uuuuuhhhhhhh...

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.560
Denny, do you have something else to do?

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:52.480
I just like to watch you guys...

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.460
Uuuuuhhhhhhh!!!

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:59.060
Denny, two's great, but three is a crowd, ha-ha.

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:02.420
- I get it. You guys wanna be alone.
- That's the idea.

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:04.800
Fine, I have homework to do, anyway.

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.160
- Bye, lovebirds!
- Bye, Denny.

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:14.160
So, was that a charming scene or should we be emotionally disturbed?

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.200
Oh well, who cares! We have a gratuitous sex scene to shoot!

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:19.780
Which, apparently, they've waited until night to do,

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:23.580
considering they started during the day, and as soon as they start taking their clothes off, it's at night.

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:25.700
What, did they just pillow fight the whole time?

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:32.460
But hey, if you think it took a while for them to start making out,

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:35.740
see how long it takes for them to actually start having sex.

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:39.360
I mean it! They kiss, play with their clothes, she puts her hair down...

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:41.620
just so she could put it back up again.

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:43.300
It practically takes forever!

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:50.880
And when'd you know it, even the SEX is really off.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.160
I mean, look at this angle here! Really look at it!

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.500
Is he fucking her belly button? 'Cause it looks like he's fucking her belly button!

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:00.680
Dude, I don't know how many times you've had sex,

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:02.680
but it's not THAT tight!

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:07.840
So I'm guessing five days later they finally get sex over with,

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:10.200
or whatever the hell you call that.

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:13.180
So Johnny gets up for a minute an-- (sounds of disgust)

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:15.040
FUCK IT, MOVIE! FUCK IT!

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:17.120
I- I GOT A HARD ENOUGH TIME WATCHING HIS ACTING,

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:18.340
AND YOU GUYS SHOW ME HIS ASS?!!

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:19.580
WHAT THE HELL?!!

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:23.980
Actually, this whole scene plays like a sex tape gone wrong.

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:26.180
In fact, I bet that's what happened.

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:27.640
I bet that's exactly what happened.

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:30.720
Tommy Wiseau was filming himself and his girlfriend having sex,

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:32.340
when somebody came across the tape.

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:34.000
They confronted him about it, and he said,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.320
"Oh no, no! Is not sex tape,

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:39.120
is a independent movie I'm making.

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:41.680
Yeah, that's it, independent movie!

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:44.460
And, uh, I'm in it, and, uh, so is my girlfriend."

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:45.760
"Tommy, what are you doing?"

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:48.040
"I had to think of something, we just have to make movie now."

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:49.160
"But neither of us can act!"

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:50.340
"We make movie now!"

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:53.520
So Lisa's mother comes over, as she feels something is wrong.

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:55.840
What's wrong? Tell me.

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:57.400
I don't love him anymore.

00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:59.540
Why don't you love him anymore? Tell me.

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:02.220
He's so... boring.

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:05.420
Okay, if making love to your navel is "boring", I don't wanna know what "exciting" is.

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:08.960
He supports you, he provides for you,

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:11.560
and darling, you can't support yourself.

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:15.120
And his position is very secure.

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:17.680
"Yes, your job that we'll never explain or see you do

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:21.240
makes much less than his job which we'll never explain or see him do".

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:24.120
So we see Lisa calling Johnny's best friend, Mark,

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:27.320
as she invites him over for a quote-unquote "talk".

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:31.240
Thank you.

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:32.940
It's hot in here.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.240
I mean, the candles, the music,

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:43.280
the sexy dress. I mean, what's going on here?

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:45.680
(The Graduate) Mrs. Robinson, you're trying to seduce me.

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:48.760
I like you... very much...

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:51.100
loverboy.

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:54.160
What are you doing this for?

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:55.940
"Duuude, I thought we were gonna talk".

00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:57.280
Don't you like me?

00:07:58.020 --> 00:07:59.640
Johnny's my best friend.

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:02.100
Forget about Johnny.

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:04.440
Um, yeah, I'm leaving now.

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:07.760
Please, don't leave! Please, don't leave!

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:10.820
Dude, I like DICKS, okay? I like DICKS.

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:12.560
I didn't know you wanted that spelled out for ya.

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:14.920
But, ultimately, he does give in,

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:17.780
as Mark and Lisa partake in spiral stair sex.

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:20.280
Interesting location...

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:22.160
But more important things are going on,

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:24.280
like Johnny buying his girlfriend some flowers.

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:26.720
Yeah, can I have a dozen red roses, please?

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.940
Oh hi, Johnny. I didn't know it was you.

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:29.600
What? Wha-?

00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:30.860
Here you go.

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:32.740
- That's mee.
- Huh? What- gah-

00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:34.440
- How much is it?
- It'll be 18 dollars.

00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:36.440
- Here you go, keep the change.
- Wait, wha-? 
- Hai, doggy.

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:37.540
- You're my favorite customer.
- What?

00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:38.640
Thanks a lot. Bye.

00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:39.740
Buh-bye!

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:40.900
Okay, hold on!

00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:42.680
What just happened?!

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:45.480
I mean, he's just buying her some flowers,

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:48.600
but... I think they were reading the script backwards or something.

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:50.580
In fact, let's analyze this scene.

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:53.780
I mean, I know I'm nitpicking, but this whole 20 seconds really fascinates me.

00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:56.520
Yeah, can I have a dozen red roses, please?

00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:58.420
Oh hi, Johnny. I didn't know it was you.

00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:00.660
You didn't know it was HIM?

00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:05.180
You didn't recognized the five-foot girly-haired French zombie until he took off his sunglasses?!

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:07.220
Here you go.

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:08.580
That's mee.

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:11.900
Why did he say that? She didn't give him any reason to say that.

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:14.200
Is that his random catchphrase of the day?

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:16.600
- How much is it?
- It'll be 18 dollars.

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:18.600
Here you go, keep the change. Hai, doggy.

00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:19.840
You're my favorite customer.

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:21.120
Thanks a lot, bye.

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:24.280
And what was up with the rushed pace of the last couple seconds?

00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:27.200
Did they only have enough money to rent the store for, like, 2 minutes

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:28.880
so they had to shoot it really fast?

00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:31.520
Hello, I would like to buy a dozen roses.

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:34.860
HEY JACKASS, I'M CLOSING MAH STORE IN 30 SECONDS!

00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:36.920
Here's the money keep the change hello doggy bye!

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:39.320
Hey, Denny, how you doing?

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:40.000
I'm fine.

00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:42.040
You look beautiful today.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:43.800
Can I kiss you?

00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:46.700
You are such a little BRAT.

00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:49.120
I'm just kidding, I love you and Johnny.

00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:53.160
You know, this movie is awkward enough, kid, it doesn't need your help.

00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:57.820
Hi, babe. These are for you.

00:09:58.360 --> 00:09:59.320
DId you get your promotion?

00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:00.640
Nah.

00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:07.040
You didn't get it, did you?

00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:09.700
What part of "Nah" did you not understand?

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:12.540
They betrayed me, they didn't keep their promise,

00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:14.280
they tricked me and I don't care anymore.

00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:15.160
Ah, Jesus.

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:18.880
You know, Jean-Claude Van Damme could be an English teacher compared to this guy!

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:20.840
You need a drink.

00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:24.440
So she makes him a drink of vodka and... wine,

00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:27.540
as they get ready for another night of slow, awkward sex.

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:32.940
"Hahaha, let's roleplay.

00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:36.100
You'll be Sonya Blade, and I'll be a terrible actor".

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:39.220
Don't do it, Critic! There's still time!

00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:40.020
Linkara?

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:41.940
You don't wanna sit through The Room!

00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:45.320
It sucks out your mind and replaces it with stupid!

00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:48.240
Dammit, Linkara, I made a promise to get through this film,

00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:50.100
and, by God, I'm gonna keep it!

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:52.500
You're mad, Critic! MAD!

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:53.540
- BEGONE!
- Okay.

00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:58.340
So after Johnny and Lisa take another week to have sex,

00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:01.260
Lisa's mother drops by again to give more advice.

00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:03.640
Everything goes wrong at once.

00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:05.720
Nobody wants to help me,

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:07.000
and I'm dying!

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:08.760
You're not dying, Mom.

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:12.180
I've got the results of the test back.

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:14.400
I definitely have breast cancer.

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:15.260
Yikes!

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:18.380
Well, gee, you're taking it pretty well.

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:21.580
Look, don't worry about it, everything will be fine.

00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:24.140
And she's taking it despicably well too.

00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:27.440
I'm so glad it wasn't any SERIOUS bad news!

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:30.320
Y'know, like, maybe Lisa's getting bored or something.

00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:32.780
Well, at least, you have a good man!

00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:33.680
You're wrong.

00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:38.800
He didn't get his promotion, and he got drunk last night,

00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:40.500
and he hit me.

00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:43.360
Johnny doesn't drink!

00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:48.540
She just admitted that he hits her, and the mother's like, "Johnny doesn't drink!

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:52.860
I know he hits you like a football player's wife, but he doesn't drink!"

00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:56.900
Meanwhile, two friends of Lisa come spontaneously out of nowhere

00:11:57.100 --> 00:11:59.100
to sneak into her apartment and have sex.

00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:05.580
Did you, uh, know... that... chocolate is the symbol of love?

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:12.240
Did you also know that when it rains, huh, huh-huh, huh, people get wet?

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:15.620
Hello.

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:18.660
What are these characters doing here?

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:21.300
I don't know! They serve no purpose to the story

00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:23.300
and bring the film to yet another complete halt,

00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:25.700
so I guess you'll have to ask the English-challenged director.

00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:28.560
Meanwhile, Denny is confronted with some bad news.

00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:29.940
You have my money, right?

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:33.840
Y-yeah, it's coming. It'll be here in a few minutes.

00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:35.980
I've got FIVE FUCKING MINUTES!

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.680
WHERE'S MY FUCKIN' MONEY, DENNY?!!

00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:40.780
He-hey, I think this is how the movie was financed.

00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:42.080
Where's my money?

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:43.560
I don't have any with me!

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:44.920
Where's my money, Denny?

00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:47.300
(The Big Lebowski) It's down there somewhere, lemme take another look.

00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:50.820
But luckily, Johnny and his friends are there to save the day.

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:52.720
What did that man want from you?!

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:55.400
- Nothing.
- Oh, THAT was not "nothing"!

00:12:55.820 --> 00:12:56.900
Tell me everything!

00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:59.640
You have no idea what kind of trouble you're in here, do you?

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:02.780
Yeah, kid! How dare you have a madman point a gun at you?

00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:03.940
That's really inconsiderate.

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:05.440
I owe him some money.

00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:07.260
What kind of money?

00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:10.440
I bought some drugs off of him. Things got mixed up,

00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:12.200
I didn't mean for this to happen.

00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:14.300
Oh, but Denny, don't you know,

00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:22.600
("Wonderful Ways to Say No" plays)

00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:25.280
A man holds a gun on you, you almost got killed,

00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:26.620
you expect me to forget that?!

00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:28.000
You're not my fucking mother!

00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:30.220
- You listen to me now, boy!
- No, no, stop!

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:33.620
Somebody had better do something around here!

00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:35.920
"Or Granny will bust a cap in your ass!"

00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:37.080
Are you okay, Denny?

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:39.580
What's okay? He's taking drugs!

00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:40.680
Let's go home.

00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:43.240
Denny, you know that Johnny is like your father,

00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:45.320
and we're your friends, we're gonna help you.

00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:46.780
Let's go home.

00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:48.240
"Hey Johnny, what was the point of that scene?"

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:49.940
"Never question me, or I cut you".

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:51.220
I miss you...

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:53.800
I just saw you, what are you talking about?

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:56.680
So yeah, Lisa invites Mark over again,

00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:59.500
as Johnny finally heard the lie that Lisa told about him.

00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:02.460
I did not hit her! It's not true! It's bullshit!

00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:04.880
I did not hit her! I did NAAAAHT!

00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:06.520
Oh hai, Mark.

00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:11.220
- I did not hit her! It's not true! 
- No, no no no!

00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:13.340
Don't play it again, I think the evidence is very clear!

00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:17.980
That is the WORST piece of acting that has ever been put on film.

00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:21.960
I mean, my God! Not one inflection was right,

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:23.860
not one word was said correctly,

00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:27.980
not one breath of air made me believe anything that he was saying.

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:31.360
There are middle-school PLAYS that put on better performances

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:32.700
than that couple of seconds.

00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:36.080
That was, like, the nirvana of bad acting. The Holy Grail!

00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:38.180
All hail to you and your lameness!

00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:40.260
I did not hit her! I did NAAAAHT!

00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:42.160
Oh hai, Mark.

00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:46.900
"By God, was that bad".

00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:50.240
You think girls like to cheat like guys do?

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:52.460
What makes you say that?

00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:54.120
I'm just thinking.

00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:56.460
I used to know a girl, she did a dozen guys,

00:14:57.420 --> 00:14:59.340
one of 'em found out about it, beat her up so bad

00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:01.300
she ended up in a hospital on Guerrero Street.

00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:01.920
Ha ha ha!

00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:04.900
Ha ha ha ha, that's not funny, you sick fuck.

00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:08.240
Ha ha ha! What a story, Mark!

00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:09.380
Yeah, you can say that again.

00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:12.040
I think he just did; that line was horribly dubbed.

00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:13.680
What a story, Mark!

00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:14.840
Yeah, you can say that again.

00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:17.000
Oh, can I? Thank you!

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:21.520
- Hey, Johnny.
- Oh hai, Denny.

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:24.720
- What wrong with Mark?
- He's cranky today, ha ha ha!

00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:28.600
Stop laughing at things that aren't funny, you goddamn weirdo!

00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:30.600
And why is there no wind blowing in their hair?

00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:32.120
It's about Lisa.

00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:34.020
Go on.

00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:36.300
She looks great in a red dress.

00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:40.100
I think I'm in love with her.

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:42.700
Go on.

00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:45.120
"Go on?" Wha- you need more?

00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:47.900
I feel like I wanna kiss her and tell her that I love her.

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:49.640
Don't worry about that.

00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:53.960
Lisa loves you too, as a person, as a human being.

00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:58.080
Wow! People take shockingly bad news really well in this movie.

00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:00.700
Did everybody just take a Xanax cocktail in this story?

00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:03.560
You can love someone deep inside your heart,

00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:05.560
and there's nothing wrong with it.

00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:10.420
If a lot of people loved each other, the world would be a better place to live.

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:14.120
"You can read about it in my new book: The Tao of Johnny.

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:16.260
It's real good, huuuuuh?"

00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:19.480
If you have any problems, talk to me, and I will help you.

00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:21.480
Awesome. Thanks, Johnny.

00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:23.160
Let's go eat, huh?

00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:26.740
Oh gee, can we eat "huh"? I've never had "huh?" before.

00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:29.000
Is there a "huh?" restaurant somewhere around here?!

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:32.320
So Johnny comes home, as Lisa's friend, Michelle, is just leaving.

00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:33.920
I can't talk right now.

00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:38.540
Why, Lisa?! Why, Lisa?! Please talk to me! PLEASE!

00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:41.300
You're lying, I never hit you!

00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:43.860
YOU ARE TEARING ME APART, LISA!

00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:46.220
Ohhhh my God...

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:47.980
Why are you so hysterical?!

00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:49.540
Do you understand life?

00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:51.380
Do you?

00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:53.960
You know what, I got it. You know what this guy is?

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:58.760
He's the Bizarro Fabio - same hokey acting, same undefinable accent,

00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:00.960
except when Fabio is muscular and good-looking,

00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:02.660
this guy is-- (sounds of disgust)

00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:03.820
Never show that again!

00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:08.900
So the guys meet up and throw a football in the alley, because...

00:17:09.860 --> 00:17:11.220
that's what guys do, I guess,

00:17:11.380 --> 00:17:13.220
as Mark lightly taps one of his friends,

00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:15.220
and he falls over like a clumsy ox.

00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:16.620
What's the point of this sequence?

00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:17.480
Nothing.

00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:19.860
You can pretty much make trading cards out of how many

00:17:19.860 --> 00:17:21.860
pointless sequences there are in this movie.

00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:24.540
Let's go home, Denny.

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:28.040
Boy, he really wants that kid home a lot, doesn't he?

00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:30.800
I'm not gonna question anything, but I'm gonna play this music.

00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:36.940
("I Will Always Love You" plays)

00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:39.280
So Lisa's mother comes over AGAIN

00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:41.800
to have yet ANOTHER tedious dialogue.

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:45.180
I expected your husband to be a little more generous.

00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:46.680
He's not my husband.

00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:50.120
I know, but Johnny is part of our family.

00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:52.680
Mom... I don't love Johnny anymore.

00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:54.920
I don't even like him.

00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:58.140
Didn't we have this conversation like 5 other times?

00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:00.100
She's like, "You should like Johnny!" "I don't!"

00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:01.000
"You're a slut!" "Yes!"

00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:02.800
WHAT ELSE IS THERE TO TALK ABOUT?

00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:06.780
So Johnny and Mark sit down and have a talk with their other good friend, Peter.

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:09.260
Hey, are you running, um, Bay to Breakers this year?

00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:12.300
- I am, sure.
- I'm not doing it this year.

00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:14.240
Ha ha ha! Chicken, Peter!

00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:16.040
You're just a little chicken!

00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:20.020
Cheep cheep-cheep-cheep-cheep cheeep-cheeeeeeep!

00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:22.580
This has been another... pointless moment.

00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:25.020
No, Critic! Don't do it!

00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:25.720
Spoony?

00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:27.800
Don't throw your life away! It's not worth it!

00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:30.200
Okay, look, I'm getting through this movie and that's final!

00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:33.780
No, Critic! Nobody should be forced to watch Highlander 2.

00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:36.020
Highlander 2? I'm not reviewing Highlander 2!

00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:39.520
Oh, good. For a minute there I thought you've gone totally insane.

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:41.060
That's a relief. So tell me,

00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:42.380
what movie are you reviewing?

00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:44.060
Well, I'm reviewing The Room.

00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:50.420
Thanks for that.

00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:53.620
So all the guys get dressed up in their tuxedos,

00:18:53.620 --> 00:18:55.700
as I guess they're getting ready to go to the wedding.

00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:57.300
Catch, Johnny!

00:18:57.520 --> 00:18:59.840
Oh wait, no, they're going out to throw the football around again.

00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:02.300
Okay, well, then are they going to the wedding?

00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:06.240
No! They just take them off and go on with their daily lives.

00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:09.280
Do they always rent tuxes when they play football?

00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:11.600
Is that just an everyday occurrence for them?

00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:13.700
What's that? You're going to play football?

00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:15.700
Oh, great, I'll go put on my finest tux!

00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:18.020
Oh wait, no no no, I'm getting married tomorrow,

00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:20.020
so, uh, I gotta iron up my jersey.

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:24.020
We got a new client at the bank, we make a lot of money.

00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:25.360
What client?

00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:27.360
I cannot tell you, it's confidential.

00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:29.040
Aw, come on, why not?

00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:32.100
No, I can't. Anyway, how's your sex life?

00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:34.700
Can't talk about it.

00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:36.600
Why not?

00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:39.240
"Why not"? How about you've just brought it the fuck out of nowhere,

00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:39.740
you...

00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:42.220
weird alien man?!

00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:44.660
And yeah, speaking of awkward,

00:19:44.660 --> 00:19:47.380
Lisa invites Mark over for another night of thrills.

00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:49.980
What's going on here?

00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:53.220
Oh my God! Do you need landing lights to the bed?!

00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:54.920
She wants to sleep with you!

00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:57.660
That's the thing she does every other stinking time you're over,

00:19:57.660 --> 00:19:58.880
you fuckin' idiot!

00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:06.040
Yeah-yeah-yeah, insert gratuitous sex scene here.

00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:08.420
So then we cut to-- Holy shit!

00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:11.900
Do these guys do anything else other than play football?

00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:14.560
This is unbelievable! Hell, they not even playing football,

00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:16.440
they're just throwing it back and forth.

00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:18.220
Do they even know the rules of football?

00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:19.560
Why don't you get a new hobby?

00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:20.720
You know, like Mark!

00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:23.960
He's made a wonderful hobby out of screwing his best friend's fiancee

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:26.300
yet acting totally surprised every time he does it.

00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:30.020
Come on.

00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:31.100
Wait wait wait, what are you doing?

00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:32.580
Nothing.

00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:39.140
Boy, this movie isn't nearly repetitive enough, though.

00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:42.400
Why don't we have yet another talk with Lisa's mother,

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:44.180
as they discuss the same thing they discussed

00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:45.820
in the last three conversations.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:47.840
I'm fixing the apartment for Johnny's birthday,

00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:49.000
but I'm really not into it.

00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:50.120
Oh, why not?

00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:52.360
Wait, wait wait, I'm keen to guess...

00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:55.260
"I'm in love with Mark, not Johnny".

00:20:55.460 --> 00:20:57.580
I'm in love with Mark, not Johnny.

00:20:57.820 --> 00:20:59.140
"It's not right, Lisa".

00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:00.740
It's not right, Lisa.

00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:01.280
Skip it!

00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:05.180
So after Johnny returns from his Grima Wormtongue audition,

00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:07.980
we see a surprise party being thrown for his birthday.

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:09.740
Yeah, later. Later.

00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:11.300
- Later?
- Yes.

00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:15.080
Oookay, enough of that scene...

00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:20.280
and now back to that scene.

00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:22.980
What, was that the screensaver while the movie loads?

00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:31.480
Hey, everybody, let's go outside for some fresh air.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.520
Wait... I have something I wanna show you.

00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:40.940
Oh, really?

00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:42.760
"Hey, what's going on here?"

00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:49.480
That's right, just make out during your own fiancee's birthday party!

00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:52.380
What in all probability could go wrong?

00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:53.900
What's going on here?

00:21:53.900 --> 00:21:55.660
Oh yeah, there's tons of people around,

00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:57.000
and you can get caught at any minute.

00:21:57.840 --> 00:21:59.240
Do you understand what you're doing?

00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:01.780
You're going to destroy Johnny!

00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:04.160
He's very sensitive.

00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:06.220
"That's right, you listen to me...

00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:08.480
whoever I am!"

00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:12.820
So as the night goes on, Mark and Johnny start to get on each other's nerves.

00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:14.060
You really don't know, do you?

00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:16.060
Maybe I know more than you think I do, Mark!

00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:17.540
Shit! Alright?

00:22:17.540 --> 00:22:19.540
What do you want from me? Huh? Huh?

00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:28.320
Alright! Okay, folks, everything is fine,

00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:30.500
fight is over for. I'm sorry, Mark.

00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:32.280
Well, good. It looks like that's over with.

00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:33.180
She doesn't wanna talk to you.

00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:34.820
Since when do you give me orders?

00:22:34.820 --> 00:22:36.740
Since Lisa's changed her mind about you!

00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:39.560
Wake up, man! What planet are you on?

00:22:39.820 --> 00:22:41.860
That's the first legitimate question I've heard throughout this movie.

00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:43.400
I think you should leave right now, Mark.

00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:44.520
Don't worry about it, man.

00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:47.660
Don't touch me, motherfucker! Get out!

00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:51.100
Stop it! Stop it!

00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:53.660
You betrayed me, you're that good!

00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:55.280
You, you're just a chicken!

00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:56.660
Cheep-cheep-cheep-cheep cheeep-cheeep!

00:22:56.660 --> 00:22:58.960
"Nobody poorly imitates my favorite farm animal!"

00:22:59.240 --> 00:22:59.740
It's over!

00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:03.600
It's not over! Everybody betrayed me, I'm fed up with this world!

00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:06.400
Oh, sheesh, you know, it's like Christopher Walken

00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:08.280
if they sucked out all likability.

00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:09.220
Ouch.

00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:13.500
So Johnny locks himself in the bathroom and refuses to come out.

00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:14.960
You can come out now, Johnny.

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:17.180
In a few minutes, bitch.

00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:22.540
Say, you know what this seems like a perfect time to do?

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:23.700
Hello.

00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:26.820
Hi, Mark. I need to talk to you.

00:23:27.020 --> 00:23:29.020
"Oh God, are you serious?"

00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:31.900
Don't worry about Johnny, he's just being a big baby.

00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:33.700
"I'm standing right here, man!"

00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:35.660
You know, I love you very much.

00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:37.680
"You're tearing me apart, Lisa!"

00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:40.200
So Johnny finally throws the bitch out

00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:41.860
as he throws the most over-the-top

00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:44.740
and yet somehow nonchalant temper tantrum.

00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:48.320
[Screams]

00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:51.560
Why, Lisa?! WHY?! WHY?!

00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:53.180
You bitch!

00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:55.900
"Yeah, I'm angry, I guess, roar, roar".

00:23:57.300 --> 00:23:59.760
"I'm really mean and frustrated, haaah?"

00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:06.120
"This is what angry people do, right, haaaaaaah?"

00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:09.720
Finally, Johnny can take it no more.

00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:12.960
He puts this God-forsaken performance to a stop.

00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:16.240
*BANG*

00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:23.100
Wake up, Johnny! Come on!

00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:25.560
"Wake up"? I don't think you really wake up

00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:27.140
from a bullet in the mouth.

00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:29.700
Is he dead?

00:24:32.620 --> 00:24:34.620
Is he dea-? Is he dea-?

00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:45.640
Well, yes. Yes, he is, young lady.

00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:47.100
He has passed on.

00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:49.320
This person is no more.

00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:51.020
He has ceased to be.

00:24:51.420 --> 00:24:53.420
He's expired and gone to meet his maker.

00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:55.420
He's a stiff, bereft of life!

00:24:55.420 --> 00:24:56.880
He rests in peace!

00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:59.540
If he didn't shoot himself, he'd be pushing up daisies!

00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:02.300
His metabolic processes are now history!

00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:05.160
He's off the twig! He's kicked the bucket!

00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:07.160
He's shuffled off the mortal coil,

00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:08.340
rung down the curtain

00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:10.860
and joined the FRIGGIN' CHOIR INVISIBLE!

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:14.640
THIS... IS AN EX-PERSON!!!

00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:16.540
Well, I'd better replace it, then.

00:25:16.540 --> 00:25:17.940
GOOOOOOD!

00:25:21.780 --> 00:25:23.400
"Goodnight, sweet prick.

00:25:23.620 --> 00:25:26.320
And flights of assholes sing thee to thy rest".

00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:30.920
I've lost him, but I still have you, right? Right?

00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:33.660
Wow! That's a clumsy rebound!

00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:35.500
You don't have me!

00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:37.760
Mark, we're free to be together!

00:25:38.260 --> 00:25:39.480
I love you!

00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:42.660
"Come on, we'll have sex on his corpse, it'll be tons of fun!"

00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:43.540
What's happening?!

00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:44.460
Don't look, Denny!

00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:45.600
Johnny's dead!

00:25:51.660 --> 00:25:54.780
"For never has there been a tale of more blow,

00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:59.360
than this dumbass bitch and her Tommy Wiseau."

00:26:01.620 --> 00:26:02.760
And that's The Room.

00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:04.820
Christity Christ Christ Christ!

00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:07.520
This movie is a miracle.

00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:10.320
I've never seen a performance so consistently bad

00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:12.760
or writing so hypnotisingly lame,

00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:15.620
but, to be honest, I know you're gonna think I'm crazy....

00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:17.400
it's really worth checking out!

00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:21.240
It truly is one of those movie you have to see to believe.

00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:24.960
Nobody could willingly make a movie this interestingly bad.

00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:27.760
It had to be the warped mindset of some weirdo

00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:30.060
whose international origins remain a mystery.

00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:32.840
So, if you're really up for some absolutely horrible

00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:36.140
yet surprisingly entertaining shit, this movie is for you.

00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:39.320
And that's my review. I hope you enjoyed it and--

00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:43.160
Critic, we've got to go! They're onto us!

00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:44.300
Why? What's going--

00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:47.920
Are you watching The Room?

00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:50.180
You know that movie is outlawed!

00:26:50.180 --> 00:26:50.820
Seize them!

00:26:51.980 --> 00:26:52.560
¡Vámonos!

00:26:58.260 --> 00:27:00.500
Well, I gotta admit, after going through all that

00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:03.200
it sure is nice to be back in my old room.

00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:11.760
Hey! How come my walls are bit of a different color?

00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:13.280
Oh my God...

00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:17.200
I travelled back and forth so much I must've altered the present.

00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:20.020
What if the machines have taken over?

00:27:20.020 --> 00:27:22.020
What if humans and apes have switched places?

00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:24.400
What if all cops are judge, jury and executioner?

00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:27.000
What if Chris Tucker is a sci-fi radio announcer in a dress?

00:27:27.220 --> 00:27:29.220
What?! WHAT?!?!

00:27:29.620 --> 00:27:31.060
Actually, nothing's different.

00:27:31.340 --> 00:27:33.180
Your wall's just a bit of a different color.

00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:34.480
Really? That's it?

00:27:35.180 --> 00:27:37.860
No other huge, mind-boggling alterations at all?

00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:39.980
Nope. Just a different wall.

00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:42.120
Oh, that, and you have a tail now.

00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:46.160
Well, that'll take a little getting used to.

00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:50.080
Welcome to my new location. I hope you enjoy, and, as always:

00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:51.380
I'm the Nostalgia Critic.

00:27:51.380 --> 00:27:53.140
I remember it so you don't have to.

00:28:03.060 --> 00:28:05.620
YOU ARE TEARING ME APART, LISA!
