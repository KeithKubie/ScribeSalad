1
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:04,980
Uh, hi, this is Jad. Hi. Yay.
To meet Jad. And I am Robert.

2
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:09,750
And today's story started when we bumped
into an article in the Philadelphia

3
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:12,300
Inquirer. Well, you're a little bit
weirded out as to why we are calling you.

4
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:17,040
Yes, I know. You know what I mean? I
just don't understand the whole thing.

5
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:21,150
That story really gets going with a phone
call to this woman, Elizabeth Mason.

6
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:24,120
I'm receptionist, last Swissport operator.

7
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:26,040
She works at a research lab in Boston.

8
00:00:26,041 --> 00:00:30,150
And one day she's sitting in her desk
and she gets a call from a woman who says

9
00:00:30,151 --> 00:00:33,990
that she has donated some eyes to them
and she wants to know what happened to

10
00:00:33,991 --> 00:00:37,530
them. Call you going every day.

11
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:40,950
I just remember it was
just very unusual, right?

12
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:42,630
And to say I didn't
know what to do with it.

13
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:45,420
I just felt like I gotta find
somebody to help this woman.

14
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:46,950
Today we're going to tell
you the story of the,

15
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,160
of the woman on the other end of
that phone call. This is her story.

16
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,450
You might say their story. So for my
title, should I say, um, I'm Sarah Gray.

17
00:00:54,451 --> 00:00:57,240
I'm the mom. I'm Ross
Gray, scree Thomas's dad.

18
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:01,260
And how did you guys meet while we're
waiting there and our bar in Glasgow.

19
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:05,040
Really? Yeah. It was on vacation with
a girlfriend and a and was it, uh,

20
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:09,710
was it a, was it, uh, what, what, what
happened without getting into too many?

21
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:14,760
I think we've got different ideas and
different recollection of what happened.

22
00:01:14,761 --> 00:01:15,594
But,

23
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,920
well you started dating across the ocean
for a year and a half and then he moved

24
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:23,450
to America five days after you arrived.

25
00:01:23,451 --> 00:01:26,960
They were married a few years after
that. They were pregnant with twins.

26
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,540
And when did you first
know that something was up?

27
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,180
It was at the 12 week screening.

28
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:35,630
They call it the first trimester
screening and they're checking for birth

29
00:01:35,631 --> 00:01:38,270
defects. I think the most
common one is down syndrome.

30
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:43,040
But it was September 30th, 2009
they went in for the screening.

31
00:01:43,041 --> 00:01:47,660
The ultrasound tech took a scan of the
two fetuses and shortly after the doc

32
00:01:47,661 --> 00:01:52,661
came into the room and said that only
one of the twins would make it in one of

33
00:01:54,111 --> 00:01:57,860
the twins that in unsafely and would
die within a few minutes or hours were

34
00:01:57,861 --> 00:01:58,694
being born.

35
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:03,350
And he said he could see that because
one of the twins had around skull and the

36
00:02:03,351 --> 00:02:05,330
other one had a bumpy skull. Huh.

37
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:07,970
But the bumpy skull showed him
that this goal wasn't correct.

38
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:11,210
It wasn't round enough. The brain
and skull weren't forming properly,

39
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:15,890
which is what anencephaly is. But
for shock, obviously. Yeah. Um,

40
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:19,460
I couldn't believe that. Yeah. It's
Kinda, it's difficult to process it,

41
00:02:19,461 --> 00:02:21,230
I think. You think, yeah,
that can't be right.

42
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:22,970
They've just told us it's identical twins,

43
00:02:22,971 --> 00:02:25,550
but one of them is completely different
from the other difficult fiction.

44
00:02:25,551 --> 00:02:27,800
Ultimately making matters worse.

45
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:31,910
The doctors said that the unhealthy
twin was posing a threat to the healthy

46
00:02:31,911 --> 00:02:35,090
twin, and if we were to be safe,

47
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:39,150
we would do a selective termination to
save the life of the healthy twin. Hmm.

48
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,110
So Sarah says they were
suddenly faced with this choice.

49
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:45,920
I actually docked to two priests on
the phone about it. Really? Yeah.

50
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:48,770
Her family's Catholic. She
was raised Catholic. I Dunno,

51
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,070
I guess I wanted to see what,
what their take was on this. Yeah.

52
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,860
This is probably not the direction we
want to go to for this my radio story,

53
00:02:54,861 --> 00:02:57,140
but no man suddenly interested in,

54
00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:00,070
basically what I was saying is would
you come and do a blessing over the

55
00:03:00,071 --> 00:03:04,570
selection determination and what
they say? One priest said, no,

56
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:08,050
he just said he wouldn't do a
blessing over a selective termination.

57
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:13,200
And then the other priest said that
because of a Thomas Aquinas rule of like,

58
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:15,910
I think it was called
double account or something,

59
00:03:15,911 --> 00:03:17,890
basically like the rule that if you,

60
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:23,940
if a train is coming and you like you
want to save the life of someone on the

61
00:03:24,821 --> 00:03:28,660
train tracks and you shoot the
driver, that's the right thing to do.

62
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:33,060
After looking it up, it's actually called
the doctrine of double effect. And uh,

63
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:36,940
she's basically right. Maybe not the
part about the shooting the driver,

64
00:03:36,941 --> 00:03:41,941
but the overall idea is that if you're
trying to do good and on the way to doing

65
00:03:42,251 --> 00:03:45,520
good, you must inadvertently do some harm.

66
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:50,340
It's okay in certain circumstances, as
long as your intentions are good. Anyway,

67
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:51,280
the priest said,

68
00:03:51,281 --> 00:03:55,180
because you're doing this with the
intent of saving the healthy twin that he

69
00:03:55,181 --> 00:03:56,830
would be there and he would do a blessing.

70
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:01,390
Fast forward a few weeks we'd booked a
hotel and we'd packed her bags and the

71
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:04,580
night before was really terrible
for both of us cause I dunno,

72
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:08,530
we had seen him on the screen and we
sort of were attached to this little kid.

73
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,600
Next day they go in for the procedure,

74
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:15,660
we go into the room and
the doctor puts the um,

75
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:20,230
sonogram on me and start
getting ready and he said,

76
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:25,390
your placenta has moved since the last
time you were here and the location where

77
00:04:25,391 --> 00:04:30,010
it is right now. Um, I don't think we
should do this. He said, if I nick it,

78
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:30,371
if I,

79
00:04:30,371 --> 00:04:35,110
if I even just nick it a little bit like
you're going to bleed uncontrollably

80
00:04:35,111 --> 00:04:37,060
and this is not safe to do.

81
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:39,430
You said they wouldn't
do it on his wife either.

82
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:43,680
What was that like to be on the,
on the table you've gone to leave?

83
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:46,470
Was it relief? Really?
Yeah, it was a relief.

84
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:49,420
I guess we've in the elevator we
just hugged. You were like, Oh,

85
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:53,010
I think the decision is taken at your
hands, you know, so it's not our fault.

86
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:56,250
But then your healthy twin
is more at risk maybe. Yes.

87
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:59,910
It was like a nail biter for the rest of
the six months. And according to Ross,

88
00:04:59,911 --> 00:05:03,600
those six months were deeply strange
just by, in one of everything.

89
00:05:03,601 --> 00:05:05,190
When you know those two babies coming,

90
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,940
then we knew we're going to be having
a funeral as well. So, you know,

91
00:05:08,941 --> 00:05:13,410
I called the, um, what'd you call it?
The funeral director and told them,

92
00:05:13,411 --> 00:05:16,170
you know, we're going to be
having a funeral. And like, well,

93
00:05:16,171 --> 00:05:20,230
when was the death and all the guys not
even born yet, you know, but I know.

94
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:22,291
All right.

95
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:27,291
So they get to the day of
March 23rd 23rd 2010 10:30 AM

96
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:33,330
Thomas came out first and he's the sick
one that had anencephaly and then a

97
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:34,163
minute later column came out.

98
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:36,540
I know it wasn't sure if Thomas
was going to be born alive.

99
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:39,720
I sort of expected him to
die within a few minutes, but

100
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:42,530
it was, he was struggling
at first when he came at it,

101
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,170
they didn't think he was
going to last too long,

102
00:05:44,171 --> 00:05:48,190
but then he kind of rally rally. Then
he was doing pretty good. And then

103
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,790
Lee, it was then Callum, the healthy twin,

104
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,660
who started to have some
trouble at the beginning.

105
00:05:52,661 --> 00:05:55,900
And so he and Sarah went
off to the infant ICU.

106
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,010
And so Ross says in the delivery room,

107
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:01,310
no, it was just me and Thomas
for quite a while. I see.

108
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:03,380
We're just sitting together.
What was that like?

109
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:05,960
Right. It was,

110
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:10,660
it was like, you know, it was cute.
You know, he's a little slim Brian,

111
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:13,540
you baby. You know what I mean?
They cry, but he was like,

112
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:17,590
grab it onto my finger and oh no, it
didn't. The kind of things that babies do,

113
00:06:17,591 --> 00:06:21,520
you know, there's nothing you can do,
but just kind of give him a cuddle,

114
00:06:21,521 --> 00:06:24,100
you know, and try and try and stop
and cry crying and [inaudible]

115
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:27,890
I n I remember coming to the recovery
room and Ross had this little bundle in

116
00:06:27,891 --> 00:06:32,090
his arms and I said, who is that? And
he said, Thomas. And I said, he's alive.

117
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:36,680
And I'm like, Oh, let me hold him. And
so I held him and yeah, he was cute.

118
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,290
Like he breastfed and we could
feed him with the bottle.

119
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:42,020
They ended up taking him home.
I didn't really planned on that.

120
00:06:42,021 --> 00:06:44,930
Like we didn't have another car seat. Um,

121
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:48,680
we just didn't think of that.
And I remember thinking like,

122
00:06:48,681 --> 00:06:51,710
what if he's going to beat the odds?
Like, do we need to arrange daycare?

123
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:53,990
And like, you know, we
hadn't thought of that.

124
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:57,180
It seems all right and we could
hang in here for awhile, you know.

125
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:00,140
But then soon after Thomas
started having seizures,

126
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,230
he started having trouble
breathing, stopped eating.

127
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,030
And at the time I remember thinking,
you know what, come on little guy,

128
00:07:07,031 --> 00:07:10,990
like just eat some more. Like if you
eat some more than you'll be stronger.

129
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:12,580
And I was like, just eat. Just eat.

130
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:14,050
Yeah.

131
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:18,010
Well, so, uh, how, how, how
long did Thomas live in the end?

132
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:20,410
Six days. Six days.

133
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,040
He died in Ross's arms and he was
surrounded by all of the people that loved

134
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:24,874
him.

135
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:32,570
And then right then we called
the Washington regional
transplant community and

136
00:07:32,571 --> 00:07:37,571
they sent a van over to our house and
they picked up his body and took him to d

137
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:40,980
c um, children's national medical center.

138
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:43,710
[inaudible]

139
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:46,870
okay. So this is where, uh, the story
really gets going? I guess so, yeah.

140
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:51,210
How did that idea of donating his
organs, skin come into your head?

141
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:54,770
Do you see an article in the paper,
the newspaper article or something?

142
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:55,231
Yeah,

143
00:07:55,231 --> 00:07:59,280
my mom saw an article about a baby who
had an huffily who donated liver cells

144
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:04,080
and most major religions support
organ donation. Oh, okay.

145
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:08,100
So the van came, picked up,
Thomas. Uh, what happened next?

146
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:11,390
Nothing happened. Nothing stood up.
Follow up for a long time. You know,

147
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,570
I think there's some letter we got
left letter in the mail, I guess

148
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:18,100
sorta a form letter. It basically said
thank you for your generous donation.

149
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:23,020
Thomas's a cornea [inaudible] sent to
this place in Boston where they study a

150
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:26,710
potential cure for blindness and his
liver had been sent at this place in

151
00:08:26,711 --> 00:08:30,940
Durham, North Carolina, where they
study a ways to treat uh, liver disease.

152
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,940
It seemed generic to me cause
I thought, I want to know like,

153
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:37,750
like who ordered it? Which researcher got
it and what study are they working on?

154
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:38,320
But you know,

155
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,890
they went on with their lives because
they had this new baby Callum Terez.

156
00:08:41,891 --> 00:08:43,840
So they put it behind
them for the most part.

157
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:48,570
But then Sarah says they got to the one
year anniversary, one year anniversary.

158
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,340
Yeah, sure. We felt like a big
moment to me. Like that's when I can,

159
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:55,980
that's when it stops being in the
present and it can being in the past,

160
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,740
you know, just explaining it to people.
He's, I can say it was a year ago,

161
00:08:58,741 --> 00:09:01,080
so they don't have to feel
stressed out when they talk to me.

162
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:02,220
And it felt like a big deal.

163
00:09:02,221 --> 00:09:05,310
Like I think we were going to go to the
cemetery and put some flowers on his

164
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:10,311
grave and I wanted to tell my family
what were the results of his donation.

165
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,290
So she called the donor family services
person at the place that picked up

166
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:18,120
Thomas's body and she
basically asked them like,

167
00:09:18,121 --> 00:09:22,500
is there any more information you can
give us about the specific study or the

168
00:09:22,501 --> 00:09:25,680
researcher of something was
published and they didn't have any.

169
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:28,710
So I just thought, okay,
well I tried, you know,

170
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:33,210
but she couldn't quite let it go. What
do you mean she couldn't quite let it go,

171
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,760
you know, curiosity.

172
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,660
But also think she was
having on some level,

173
00:09:39,661 --> 00:09:42,780
like a big conversation with the
universe. They both were like,

174
00:09:42,781 --> 00:09:46,890
this terrible thing happened. How do
you explain it to yourself? I mean,

175
00:09:46,891 --> 00:09:48,030
I think honestly it's shorter.

176
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:53,160
It sort of shook my faith in
God and how the universe works.

177
00:09:53,161 --> 00:09:56,870
I thought that Karma worked or if I
was a basically a good person and I've

178
00:09:56,871 --> 00:09:59,970
obeyed the rules, good things would
happen to me. Whatever the reason,

179
00:09:59,971 --> 00:10:03,420
these thoughts about Thomas and where
he ended up, they were just there.

180
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:05,880
She had no real opportunity to act on it,

181
00:10:05,881 --> 00:10:08,130
so they would just kind of
come in and out of her mind.

182
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:12,060
But then around the two year
anniversary, so this is now a year later,

183
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:17,090
I had a business trip to Boston and I
was exhibiting at a conference at Heinz

184
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:20,490
Convention Center and I googled
it and I saw that Skype bins,

185
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:22,560
eye research institute
was just a few miles away.

186
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:27,030
That's where Thomas' corneas
had been said, ah, lunch break.

187
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:32,160
That's exactly what I did. I
called Skype ins and I said,

188
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:32,641
you know,

189
00:10:32,641 --> 00:10:37,170
I donated my son's eyes to this lab a
couple of years ago and I'm here in town.

190
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:40,740
Is there any chance I can come by
for a tour for like 10 minutes?

191
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:44,610
Then with the weird, been a weird
phone call. Yes. I mean, yes. Yeah,

192
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:47,790
that was like a wake her up or
that's Elizabeth Mason again.

193
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:50,580
It was just very unusual.
I think she was surprised.

194
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,850
I didn't know what to do with it. Had
you ever gotten a call like that before?

195
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:57,390
Never have gotten in the car and just
been working there for 25 years. She said,

196
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:00,420
hold on, let me connect you to
the right person. Don't hang up.

197
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,540
A lot of times when I say
something they hang up on me.

198
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:07,430
So I said please help line y started
searching for someone to speak with.

199
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:09,810
It's going to take me a while cause I've
got to figure out who that is but don't

200
00:11:09,811 --> 00:11:10,644
hang up.

201
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:15,480
And they connected me with someone in
donor relations but it was financial donor

202
00:11:15,481 --> 00:11:19,600
relations. Oh like like the honey.

203
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:24,360
Yeah, organ donor. But they,

204
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:27,030
cause they don't have any other
donor relations that you know,

205
00:11:27,031 --> 00:11:31,110
like that was the person that gives the
tours and deals with the public so that

206
00:11:31,111 --> 00:11:32,840
she got to talk to me
and she was [inaudible].

207
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:37,020
The woman was a little bit
flustered but super nice and said,

208
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,960
we know we've never done this
before. But yeah, come on down.

209
00:11:39,961 --> 00:11:42,930
We'll give you a tour. I was so excited.

210
00:11:42,931 --> 00:11:45,720
I took pictures of the outside
of the building and I felt,

211
00:11:45,721 --> 00:11:50,721
I stood in the lobby and I put one of
the brochures in my purse and I just felt

212
00:11:50,881 --> 00:11:52,230
like, I can't believe I'm here.

213
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:54,760
This is like being in [inaudible]
workshop or something.

214
00:11:54,761 --> 00:11:57,460
Like I didn't think this was a
place you could actually visit.

215
00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:01,860
She was taken around and eventually
she got taken to the lab where Thomas'

216
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:05,980
corneas went and there were refrigerators
with signs that said no food.

217
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:12,480
And then she introduced me to this guy
called Dr. James [inaudible] who's a

218
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:17,440
professor of Ophthalmology at Harvard
Med school and he was eating his lunch at

219
00:12:17,441 --> 00:12:21,430
his desk and she explained who
I was and he said, you know,

220
00:12:21,431 --> 00:12:23,800
thank you for the donation and
do you have any questions for me?

221
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:27,580
And of course she did. I wanted to
know how valuable the eyes were.

222
00:12:27,581 --> 00:12:31,210
Like if they get thousands and thousands
or if they get one or two or like when

223
00:12:31,211 --> 00:12:34,630
the delivery came. Was everyone
excited or was it no big deal?

224
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:38,200
Like was it sitting on a shelf collecting
dust or were people doing stuff with

225
00:12:38,201 --> 00:12:40,510
it? He put down his lunch and um,

226
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:44,020
he said most of the i's that we get are
from people who are older just because

227
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,670
most people are older when they die,

228
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:48,760
an infant's eyes are worth
their weight in gold.

229
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:50,133
Wow.

230
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:53,510
I was like, God, I could barely speak.
I was like, um, could you tell me why?

231
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,010
He said,

232
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:59,990
because they regenerate the
regenerative properties and he said,

233
00:12:59,991 --> 00:13:02,330
if you don't mind me asking,
how long ago did your son die?

234
00:13:02,331 --> 00:13:04,970
And I said about two years
ago. And he said, well,

235
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,570
we're likely still using
your sons cells right now.

236
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:10,380
Okay.

237
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:11,430
Cause that's how long they last.

238
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,760
Wow. I know.

239
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:19,180
So at that point Sarah was like,
okay, since that worked out so well,

240
00:13:19,181 --> 00:13:23,830
why not just go keep going with it and
visit all of the places where bits and

241
00:13:23,831 --> 00:13:28,510
pieces of Thomas ended up. So, you
know, chase down his liver, his retina,

242
00:13:28,511 --> 00:13:32,110
his cord blood. How many doctors might
that be? Do you have any idea? Like,

243
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:35,380
well there's the Boston one,
there's two in North Carolina.

244
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:39,940
She would ultimately discover
one in Richmond, Virginia,
one in Philly. What if?

245
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,330
What if? It turns out that
these people, you know,

246
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:46,870
didn't find anything. You
know, research is research.

247
00:13:46,871 --> 00:13:49,060
You don't always have a head. That's true.

248
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:52,530
She's not hitting for validation
necessarily. Here. She might find it.

249
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:57,100
She might get further lost. Well,
yeah, but she's going to go.

250
00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:01,180
She's going to go and she's not
going to stop. Cross your fingers.

251
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:02,043
It's coming up.

she's gotten this rose of a success.

287
00:16:09,721 --> 00:16:13,200
And so after that her and Ross had getting
a car and head down south to Durham,

288
00:16:13,201 --> 00:16:17,760
North Carolina to track down a Thomas's
liver and a bit of his blood cord blood

289
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:22,140
because it turns out that in the delivery
room right after both twins were born,

290
00:16:22,141 --> 00:16:25,650
nurses had withdrawn a little bit
of cord blood from both twins,

291
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:29,760
sent it off to Duke where researchers
were studying the disease that killed

292
00:16:29,761 --> 00:16:34,530
Thomas and incessantly. She says they
walked in, we met the study coordinator,

293
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:38,100
this guy who worked on the human
genome project, uh, Grad students.

294
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:41,910
They met all these different researchers
who all seemed really excited about her

295
00:16:41,911 --> 00:16:42,960
twins blood samples.

296
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:45,810
I think it was just weird that one of
them had anencephaly and one of them

297
00:16:45,811 --> 00:16:47,640
didn't and they were
genetically identical.

298
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:52,570
So it's a good control study for them to
compare. After they all took the tour,

299
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:57,120
one of the researchers even told them
that they had compared Thomas' blood to

300
00:16:57,121 --> 00:17:02,121
columns and they found there
were a thousand differences
in epigenetics between

301
00:17:02,731 --> 00:17:06,120
both twins. They're called
epigenetic differences.

302
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,560
I think their genes are the same.

303
00:17:07,561 --> 00:17:10,350
But the things that control the genes
were different. That's so interesting.

304
00:17:10,351 --> 00:17:11,790
So they began identical,

305
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:16,670
but then somehow in utero thousand little
changes crept up between them. Yes.

306
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:17,910
Yeah.

307
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:21,270
It's possible that a few of those changes
might one day explain the disease.

308
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:22,051
In fact,

309
00:17:22,051 --> 00:17:25,860
I even asked the Grad student who
worked on it most closely Dierdre crop,

310
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:28,350
I said, were you surprised by
what you saw? And she said,

311
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:33,120
for me to be surprised, that implies that
I knew what to expect. She said, well,

312
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:35,670
just at the beginning of this,
trying to learn about this.

313
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:39,660
So that's two roses, like this is a,

314
00:17:39,661 --> 00:17:43,230
this is an amazing gift visit to sort
of kickbox. She's on a roll here.

315
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,330
So after visit two, they got in the car,

316
00:17:45,331 --> 00:17:48,150
drove down the street to
this place called Cyto Net,

317
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:51,060
which is where Thomas has liver.
I ended up basically side on it,

318
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:55,500
will take a solid liver and they liquefy
it and then they inject the liquid

319
00:17:55,501 --> 00:17:59,700
liver into a baby that's waiting on a
liver transplant as a bridge therapy.

320
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:04,830
Liquid liver, liver in a tube. Yeah. They
went in and got a tour. Refrigerators,

321
00:18:04,831 --> 00:18:06,630
petri dishes, the whole thing.

322
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:10,230
The researchers then tell her that they
had a little issue with Thomas's liver.

323
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:15,470
His liver was bruised when they got it
so they couldn't inject it into a baby.

324
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:19,620
But then they told her that they were
able to use it in an experiment to

325
00:18:19,621 --> 00:18:22,590
determine what was the best temperature
to freeze infant liver cells,

326
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:26,790
which is negative 150 degrees
Celsius as you already know,

327
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:29,880
common knowledge, half a rose there,

328
00:18:29,881 --> 00:18:33,060
half a rose and she says at one point
as they were being walked around the

329
00:18:33,061 --> 00:18:33,510
place,

330
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:38,430
we walked through the break room and
someone had taken a picture of Thomas that

331
00:18:38,431 --> 00:18:42,630
we had handed out and they
took the photograph and they
taped it up in the break

332
00:18:42,631 --> 00:18:46,410
room with a little sign that they wrote
on at St Thomas Gray was a donor here in

333
00:18:46,411 --> 00:18:48,360
March 29th,

334
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:52,290
2010 and I was so excited to see that
because I thought they're just as curious

335
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:55,590
about us as we are about them.
Like I was wondering who,

336
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:58,470
what kind of person goes to work
and opens up a box with liver in it.

337
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:02,310
And they're probably wondering what kind
of person takes their loved one's liver

338
00:19:02,311 --> 00:19:03,870
and puts it in a box
and mailed it over here.

339
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:08,500
So, uh, my name is
[inaudible] Ganguly. Uh,

340
00:19:08,501 --> 00:19:12,940
I am a professor in the Department of
Genetics at University of Pennsylvania

341
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:13,870
School of medicine.

342
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:16,980
Now a Rupa Ganguly just
switched to her for a second.

343
00:19:16,981 --> 00:19:20,940
She studies a kind of cancer of
the eye called Retinal Blastoma,

344
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,220
which happens almost
exclusively in children.

345
00:19:23,221 --> 00:19:25,320
And at this point she doesn't know Sarah.

346
00:19:25,321 --> 00:19:28,170
She has no concept of this
whole search that's happening.

347
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:31,500
She is just studying eyes. Where
are we by the way? Philly, Philly,

348
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,270
Philadelphia. No, she studies tumors,

349
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:36,030
but she also needs healthy
retinas in order to do her work.

350
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:41,120
Now you can imagine that getting
a normal retina is not a very,

351
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:46,500
uh, easy task because why would you
get a normal retina from a baby?

352
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:51,300
I must allude that if and
when an eyeball comes,

353
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:54,720
it is not a pleasant experience, right?

354
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:58,260
Because for a moment you
have to think the origin,

355
00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:00,840
the sources of this eyeball,

356
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:06,410
and it's sad and every possible setting,

357
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:10,050
it's sad, sad and frustrating. She says,

358
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:13,680
because only when a normal child dies,

359
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:15,870
that's when I can get this retina.

360
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:20,220
So it's a horrible set up in my mind.

361
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:24,140
So she says often when the retinas
arrive, which happens maybe once a year,

362
00:20:24,141 --> 00:20:28,380
and you pull them out of their
packaging, you right away you feel like,

363
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:31,250
like maybe you're trading
on other people's misery.

364
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:35,340
And I'm an, it's so bad when a child dies,

365
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:41,060
but I am asking for his
or her retina in a way.

366
00:20:42,961 --> 00:20:47,130
I had this sense of guilt in my head. No,

367
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:51,220
Aruba had never spoken to a
parent of any of her samples.

368
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:54,940
So when she got that email and she was
sitting at a computer and she read the

369
00:20:54,941 --> 00:20:57,340
email from the company that
provided or the sample saying,

370
00:20:57,341 --> 00:21:00,760
the mother of this sample wants
to get in contact with you,

371
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:05,400
ah, I paused, I stopped and uh, uh,

372
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:09,640
doing what I was doing and I thought, um,

373
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:14,320
why does the mother want to talk to me?

374
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:18,040
That was my first question. So

375
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:25,100
I did not reply right away. But
after my conversation with the lab,

376
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:29,390
I took I think one day
to compose a letter.

377
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:34,040
And I sent it back to Sarah Gray and
they ended up eventually talking on the

378
00:21:34,041 --> 00:21:38,360
phone. I told her, I think, uh,
at the very onset that Sarah,

379
00:21:38,361 --> 00:21:43,040
you have to understand
that, um, I feel awful.

380
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:46,090
She said she felt kind of guilty
because she wished for this sample,

381
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:50,350
like almost by wishing for it,
she had made it happen. She said,

382
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:54,610
you should not feel bad about it.
If you didn't use my son's retina,

383
00:21:54,611 --> 00:21:58,630
I would have buried it in the ground.
Like you're the only one that wanted it.

384
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:00,460
Bad things happen to children.

385
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:05,680
And so by being able to
help you with your work,

386
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:08,620
we added a layer to Thomas's life

387
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:13,890
that was, uh, I was amazed.

388
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:18,130
Eventually Sarah and
Ross visited Arup as lab.

389
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:21,640
She gave them a tour and she
sewed them Thomas' retina.

390
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:26,650
She still has samples of it
in her freezer. Tiny little,

391
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:29,560
I don't know, tiny little
vials, maybe a third.

392
00:22:29,561 --> 00:22:34,100
The size of your pinkie filled with
frozen liquid liquified right now or in a,

393
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:35,170
it didn't look like much,

394
00:22:35,171 --> 00:22:39,830
but it was amazing to think of how
many people were involved getting these

395
00:22:39,831 --> 00:22:43,720
samples. They're like, we had to approve
it. We had to fill out this paperwork.

396
00:22:43,721 --> 00:22:45,610
Then the doctor had to
come and remove the highs.

397
00:22:45,611 --> 00:22:48,510
The NYSE had to be processed and
then I'd have to be shipped up there.

398
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:52,480
Then they have to do whatever
DNA process they do and just how,

399
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:58,000
I don't know, valuable, maybe
even priceless. The sample is,

400
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:03,900
Sarah says that throughout the whole
process of losing a child and then seeing

401
00:23:04,481 --> 00:23:07,240
him reclaimed bit by bit by
all of these different people,

402
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:09,580
something she shifted in me.

403
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:13,793
[inaudible]

404
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:19,300
I used to think like the universe treated
people the way it should and now I

405
00:23:19,791 --> 00:23:24,200
don't really believe that, but
um, I do believe that there are,

406
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:25,610
um,

407
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:30,610
really amazing kind people in the world
and science and medicine has something

408
00:23:33,171 --> 00:23:34,004
to do with that.

409
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:35,670
[inaudible]

410
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:40,530
I started feeling that these were Thomas'
colleagues in his coworkers and that

411
00:23:40,531 --> 00:23:45,440
he was a valuable partner in the important
research that was being done and felt

412
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:47,300
an even more fundamental shift.

413
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:51,950
Almost like I had felt like I was a
boat on an ocean that was like rocky and

414
00:23:51,951 --> 00:23:55,410
choppy with waves. And I've
had this feeling that I am,

415
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:56,960
I'm not the boat on the ocean,

416
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:03,340
like the decisions that I make are
changing other people as opposed to just,

417
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:06,440
I'm a boat getting slack
with waves all the time.

418
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:12,340
Like the thank the Philadelphia Inquirer
for getting us going on this. Yeah.

419
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:13,330
Especially, yeah.

420
00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:17,770
Big thanks to Michael Vitez for his
reporting and to dummy and Marchetti for

421
00:25:17,771 --> 00:25:21,340
production support and to lots of
Nasr for all that help with research.

422
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:24,250
I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert
Krulwich. Thanks for listening.
