[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.520
STEVE BAZYL: Hi, everyone, and
thanks for joining us today.

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.950
I'm Stephen Bazyl and today we
are joined with a special

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.344
guest, Brett van Zuiden
from filepicker.io.

00:01:25.344 --> 00:01:26.120
BRETT VAN ZUIDEN:
How's it going?

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.950
STEVE BAZYL: Great.

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.780
So today we're going
to do two things.

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:29.810
Actually, three things.

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.360
We have a recap of last week's
Google I/O, then we're going

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.980
to talk a little bit about
filepicker and some of the

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.420
great work you've been doing
with Cloud APIs and where

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.400
things are going.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.260
And we're also going to do a
review of one of the apps that

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:50.360
was actually at I/O in
the sandbox, Magisto.

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.570
So let's get started with I/O.
So, Brett, you actually were

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:54.530
at I/O.

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:55.640
BRETT VAN ZUIDEN: I was.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.540
I thought it was fantastic.

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.430
Definitely a lot of the cool new
stuff coming out, not only

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.090
new functionality on the web,
but also some sort of sneak

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.070
peeks into where we're driving
and the rest of the Google

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:09.509
products are going.

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:10.660
STEVE BAZYL: Any particular
highlights?

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.420
Things that were
your favorites?

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.160
BRETT VAN ZUIDEN: The web
components has been something

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.320
I've been watching for awhile,
and the request autocomplete

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:19.480
was actually a new
thing I hadn't

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.570
seen that got me excited.

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:22.220
STEVE BAZYL: Very cool.

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:23.470
I like the web components.

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.850
I'm a big fan of [? agular, ?]

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.370
I love where all that stuff
is going as well.

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.740
So on the drive side, most of
our talks are now available

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:35.040
online on the
Developers.google.com/live and

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.020
on YouTube.

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.780
We'll put together a playlist
of all the drive sessions

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.890
sometime this week so that
you'll be able to find our

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:43.170
sessions pretty easily.

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.850
There are a lot of great ones.

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:50.350
One from Ali Afshar about using
the app data for syncing

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:51.700
preferences on Android.

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.040
And they actually open sourced
a library that was built for

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.810
that demo, and it's really
cool and getting a lot of

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.030
interest already.

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.450
Brian and Cheryl also did a
great talk on the real time

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.270
API that is well worth watching
if you're interested

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:07.660
in using that API.

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.880
The sandbox was a great hit.

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.650
We had 24 different vendors
come into the Google I/O

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.510
sandbox for those three days.

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.550
Some of those were for Google
Drive, some were with Apps

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:23.800
Script and also the new Gmail
feature for having actions.

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.250
Some really great demos and
we're actually going to talk

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.720
about one of those later
later today.

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.610
This is Magisto, a really,
really awesome video editing

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.190
app that talks to Drive.

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:35.910
And Carrie will do
a demo and walk

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:37.160
through that pretty quickly.

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:41.050
In terms of product
announcements, we didn't

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:44.100
announce too much yet, but
there's a lot in store for the

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:45.750
next couple weeks.

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.440
One thing we did talk about
earlier, before I/O, was

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:49.570
storage unification.

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:52.360
So now your storage, for
Google Drive, is shared

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:55.410
between Gmail and your Google+
photo attachments.

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:58.670
And we have, again, we have a
lot of cool stuff coming up in

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:00.750
the next few weeks.

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.910
So let's talk about
filepicker.io.

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.580
So for those who don't know it,
can you give a little bit

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.240
of a background about what
you've been working on--

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.720
BRETT VAN ZUIDEN: Sure.

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:09.590
STEVE BAZYL: --and what you're
trying to solve for

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:10.360
developers.

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.710
BRETT VAN ZUIDEN: Of course.

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:14.750
So one thing that we're noticing
with the migration of

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:19.940
content from the local devices
to online, for me at least,

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.290
and for a lot of users, that
Cloud is sort of the default

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.800
hard drive.

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.260
It's the default place
where people are

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:26.130
storing their content.

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:30.140
That's everything from services
like Google+ and

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:33.630
Facebook and Instagram for their
photos, to Drive and

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:36.380
Dropbox, Inbox, for things
like documents.

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:37.840
Even things like Gmail
attachments.

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.260
And so what we wanted to do was
say, let's provide a way

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:45.080
for developers to hook into all
these different sources

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.180
and to provide that choice for
their users and to be able to

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.000
access that wherever
their users are

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.950
storing their content.

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:53.540
And so, obviously, a lot of
the Google services play a

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:56.700
pretty central role in that,
not only Drive, but also

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:00.620
Picasa and then Gmail
attachments, but also making

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:03.470
sure that we connect into some
of these and the other Cloud

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:06.140
services like Box and Dropbox.

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:09.070
And so we really tried to put
those all together in a nice

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:13.650
package for developers so that
they can say, hey, I want a

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:16.940
profile image and I want an
image and it really doesn't

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:19.060
matter to me where that image
comes from, whether it comes

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:23.710
from the webcam or somewhere
online or even the hard drive.

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:27.040
So we bundle that up for them,
provide it a nice clean API

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:29.040
and we take care of the rest.

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:30.090
STEVE BAZYL: Sounds awesome.

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:30.970
You want to show a demo?

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:32.750
BRETT VAN ZUIDEN: Sure thing.

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:37.050
So here you'll see this is
pretty much as simple as it

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:39.790
gets here with the command.

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:41.880
So it is a fully
JavaScript API.

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:47.420
We also have an API on Android
and iOS that's fairly similar,

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:52.340
but just to show it here, so the
command filepicker.pick,

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:55.060
you give us a callback function
and we had you back

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:57.280
some data along with the
URL to the file.

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:59.940
So here that's all the code
that's necessary.

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:02.740
So here now, if I go
and say OK, great.

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:04.040
Let's figure out--

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:07.065
OK, this is a pretty
good document here.

00:06:07.065 --> 00:06:10.430
I'm going to upload this and
then we hand back a URL.

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:14.080
And now this will actually point
directly to the content.

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:17.085
We'll also do things like store
it on S3 for you, sort

00:06:17.085 --> 00:06:19.640
of handle a bunch of
the other common

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:20.990
actions that people want.

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:23.250
But for instance, if we wanted
to say OK, what does this look

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:26.290
like if we specifically
want images?

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:30.150
So if we say we want
the mime type to be

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:36.420
image/jpeg say, great.

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:39.180
Run this, and now the selections
will be limited

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:40.610
just to the jpeg images.

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:44.340
So now, if I go here, I select
this-- oh, see, PNGs are not

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:47.860
allowed, I should have known
that was going to happen here.

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:49.770
But close this.

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:51.695
We'll say we do actually
want that PNG.

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:57.170
Go to Developers Live.

00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:58.900
Here we go.

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:00.840
And uploaded successfully.

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:02.190
So now we can take this--

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:04.170
and this is a fully
functioning URL.

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:06.520
This points directly
to the data.

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:09.810
So that now you get this
and, it's successful.

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:14.130
So that is full demo of the
pick functionality.

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:17.330
There is also storing and
saving out to the Cloud.

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:19.160
STEVE BAZYL: And you have a
similar functionality for

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:19.960
mobile as well, right?

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:20.380
BRETT VAN ZUIDEN: We do.

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:22.080
STEVE BAZYL: Android and iOS?

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:23.350
Very cool.

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:26.730
That is probably about as easy
as it gets to integrate with

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:27.900
Cloud storage.

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:28.840
BRETT VAN ZUIDEN: That's
what we try.

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:33.850
And a few things here that we
really believe, one is I'm

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:35.030
doing this all on
a Chromebook.

00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:39.090
And I think that really exposes
some of the power and

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:42.070
some of the sort of movement
that we're seeing.

00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:45.490
I have access to everything that
I need on this Chromebook

00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:47.250
even if it's not sitting
directly on the

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:48.820
device's hard drive.

00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:52.180
Also, you notice, we passed
around these URLs and one of

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:54.680
the things that we think we
provide a lot of value in is

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:58.820
going from a pass-by value
architecture where, whenever

00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:02.550
you want to transfer content
between Google Drive and your

00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:04.410
application, or even from
the hard drive and your

00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:06.600
application, it's all
done by sending

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:07.850
these big blobs around.

00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:09.780
And so you have to configure
your load balance or an engine

00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:13.570
x and all those things, whereas
for us, we turn it

00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:14.640
into a URL for you.

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:17.060
We handle all that and then you
can pass that URL around,

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:19.230
you can store that in your
database, and it becomes much

00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:21.000
easier to handle.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.350
STEVE BAZYL: Definitely
the way to go.

00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:28.580
So your whole product is an API,
and I was just curious

00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:31.400
what lessons you had for people
who maybe there's other

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:36.020
areas for services-- maybe not
files-- but other areas of

00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:39.419
technology where really the
product is an API offering.

00:08:39.419 --> 00:08:43.820
And what did you learn in the
past few years as you got

00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:48.010
started and what advice for
the next filepicker.io?

00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:53.790
BRETT VAN ZUIDEN: I'll start
with some of the fun things

00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:55.130
and then get into, I
guess, some of the

00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:57.270
more tangible things.

00:08:57.270 --> 00:09:01.140
.io is actually a great domain
name for signaling that you're

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:02.700
a developer product.

00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:05.520
We, in some of our initial
outreach back before people

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:09.180
had heard of us, we'd send
emails to people and at first

00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:11.240
they'd be like, well, I looked
at the email, I thought it

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:13.890
might just be some spammy
business person sending it and

00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:16.420
then I saw the .io and I was
like, ah, these guys are

00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:17.110
developers.

00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:21.520
.io, especially for us, it's
input, output, Google I/O,

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:22.320
things like that.

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:27.520
So in terms of more on the
business and strategy side,

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:32.180
it's really important that
customer support stands first

00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:33.740
and foremost.

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:35.090
When people--

00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:38.410
and that goes everything from
having great documentation to

00:09:38.410 --> 00:09:40.990
having real people available
to email.

00:09:40.990 --> 00:09:44.460
So one of things that we still
do is whenever someone signs

00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:48.270
up we send them an email from a
real person, we assign them

00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:51.680
to a developer that says, I'm
here to help you get started.

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:53.760
And for a lot of people, whether
they're just trying it

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:55.500
out or whether they're building
it into their

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:58.280
production app, that really
goes a long way.

00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:00.100
STEVE BAZYL: I definitely
agree.

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:03.290
I've actually talked to a few
of those people and everyone

00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:06.770
has been super awesome
on your team.

00:10:06.770 --> 00:10:10.370
So I love everything
filepicker.io is doing.

00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:13.000
I think it's a great
way to get started.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:19.350
One of the concerns, for me at
least, is it tends to bring

00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:22.500
all the APIs down to the lowest
common denominator.

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:24.880
And I was wondering, what
advice do you have for

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:28.610
developers in terms of how do
they make that decision as to

00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:31.480
whether or not they use
something like filepicker.io--

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:35.100
which is great for reaching a
lot of users really quickly--

00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:37.830
versus going very deep into
one of the particular

00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:39.880
providers and taking advantage
of some of the

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:40.880
more advanced features?

00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:41.380
BRETT VAN ZUIDEN: Sure.

00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:42.260
STEVE BAZYL: How do
you guide people?

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:44.010
BRETT VAN ZUIDEN: So we try to
aim for what we call the

00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:45.360
middle common denominator.

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:50.530
So we'll do things where we'll
sort of up-level some of APIs

00:10:50.530 --> 00:10:53.020
that aren't as good and provide
the functionality that

00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:55.860
makes them at least sort
of on par with average.

00:10:55.860 --> 00:11:00.780
We find though, is if you're
building a real time document

00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:04.330
collaboration, service, things
like that, of course, there

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:06.620
are really those core APIs that
you need to leverage.

00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:09.310
That's great and we want
to encourage that.

00:11:09.310 --> 00:11:12.950
What we really find is we're
sort of going for the broad

00:11:12.950 --> 00:11:16.060
use case where people are
saying, really what I want is

00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:17.550
I just want to be able to
import content to my

00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:20.170
application, or allow the
user to save it out.

00:11:20.170 --> 00:11:26.110
And there's all I sort of want
is a chunk of data and for

00:11:26.110 --> 00:11:29.270
that I think that we can provide
that very easily.

00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:31.590
One of the things that we see,
that we've worked with a lot

00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:36.250
of people on, is if they need to
do folder level operations

00:11:36.250 --> 00:11:40.230
or commenting, there's a lot of
richness in the Drive APIs,

00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:41.810
as well as some of
these other APIs.

00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:45.560
For instance, we don't expose
Facebook tags and things like

00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:47.680
that to sort of unify
them together.

00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:49.680
So they're definitely
situations where

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:50.800
I say, go for it.

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:53.220
Use the traditional APIs.

00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:55.230
But if you can get away with
saying, hey, really we just

00:11:55.230 --> 00:11:55.950
want the content.

00:11:55.950 --> 00:11:57.860
I think we can provide
that need for you.

00:11:57.860 --> 00:12:02.080
STEVE BAZYL: And in terms of
adoption and growth, things

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:02.550
are looking good.

00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:05.930
We're certainly seeing Drive
growing like crazy.

00:12:05.930 --> 00:12:07.520
I hope things are looking
on your end as well.

00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:07.900
BRETT VAN ZUIDEN: They are.

00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:09.670
It's very exciting.

00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:11.810
It's one of these things now
where we're starting to reach

00:12:11.810 --> 00:12:13.270
out and hit rate limits.

00:12:13.270 --> 00:12:14.270
It's fun, though.

00:12:14.270 --> 00:12:16.620
It's a lot of fun and we
keep cranking along.

00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:17.870
STEVE BAZYL: Awesome.

00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:18.910
Stay tuned.

00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:20.120
I'm going to turn it
over to Carrie.

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:25.070
She is going to talk about
really cool app, Magisto, and

00:12:25.070 --> 00:12:28.770
show some of the inner workings
of Google life here.

00:12:28.770 --> 00:12:30.360
CARRIE ROWE: Hi everybody,
I'm Carrie Rowe.

00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:34.520
I'm on the Drive dev-rel team
and I was at the Google I/O

00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:37.860
the past week, and one of the
apps that I was blown away by

00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:40.740
in our sandbox was this
app called Magisto.

00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:43.950
And what they do, it's a video
editing software app.

00:12:43.950 --> 00:12:47.240
And I take tons of video on my
Android phone, like minutes

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:49.710
and minutes of video every week,
and I never look at it

00:12:49.710 --> 00:12:51.620
and I never share it
with people because

00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:53.530
it's just not watchable.

00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:57.780
So what Magisto does is it will
automatically video edit

00:12:57.780 --> 00:12:58.900
your videos for you
and it makes it

00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:02.650
really easy and magical.

00:13:02.650 --> 00:13:04.360
So let's take a look.

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:09.630
So I'm on the Magisto website
and let's go.

00:13:09.630 --> 00:13:11.620
And what's great about--

00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:14.650
let's see, continue.

00:13:14.650 --> 00:13:17.040
What's great about Magisto is
it's integrated with our

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:21.380
Google Drive products and so I
can select my videos directly

00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:24.450
from Google Drive.

00:13:24.450 --> 00:13:26.880
So right here you see on their
front page, I can either

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:29.420
select a file from my computer
or I can select a file

00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:32.970
directly from the Cloud.

00:13:32.970 --> 00:13:36.150
And so I've taken a whole bunch
of videos and I created

00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:38.190
one yesterday with our
dev-rel team right

00:13:38.190 --> 00:13:39.850
here playing Foozball.

00:13:39.850 --> 00:13:42.770
And so I'm going to select my
video and then the next step

00:13:42.770 --> 00:13:47.290
is I can select the background
that I want.

00:13:47.290 --> 00:13:49.640
And they have all these
really great

00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:51.300
pre-edited background styles.

00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:55.730
So let's go with the
street beats.

00:13:55.730 --> 00:13:58.020
And then the next step, once you
have your background, is

00:13:58.020 --> 00:13:59.680
you can choose any music
that you want to add.

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:02.000
So they're making every step
really, really easy for you to

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.780
make a really great video.

00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:09.320
So let's see, let's
go with Lady Gaga.

00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:12.040
And then the third step is you
just hit Create, and it's as

00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:13.840
easy as that.

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:15.460
And so I've already created
the video, so

00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:16.710
let's take a look.

00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:23.590
And so yesterday I created about
a minute long video of

00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:25.560
our team playing Foozball.

00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:27.540
So you can see that
it's taken--

00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:30.810
it's now shortened it into
a 30 second video.

00:14:30.810 --> 00:14:32.420
And what it's done
is it's selected

00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:33.850
all of the best clips.

00:14:33.850 --> 00:14:37.460
So I know I'm not a professional
videographer, so

00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:39.700
when I take lots of video there
tends to be a lot of

00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:41.860
dead time and parts that
aren't as interesting.

00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:44.360
So it really creates
and condenses it

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:45.600
into the best content.

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:49.690
And it adds in, you saw, the
backgrounds of all the text

00:14:49.690 --> 00:14:51.300
and images.

00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:52.990
And then you can add music
to it as well.

00:14:52.990 --> 00:14:55.030
And then when you're done, you
can share it with your friends

00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:55.410
and family.

00:14:55.410 --> 00:14:58.830
So this is a really great app to
help you access your videos

00:14:58.830 --> 00:15:00.910
more and share them
with everybody.

00:15:00.910 --> 00:15:02.600
And that's it for our
app of the week.

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:04.940
And I'll turn it back to Steve
now to talk a little bit about

00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:06.940
what we have in store
for you next week.

00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:07.700
STEVE BAZYL: Thanks.

00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:11.430
And I do believe my team
actually won that game.

00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:16.020
We did get interrupted with a
freak quad copter accident

00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:19.150
during that but it was actually
a fun game and a

00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:21.110
great serendipitous moment.

00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:24.810
So for next week we are going
to be here talking about how

00:15:24.810 --> 00:15:27.450
you can work for Google
Developer Relations.

00:15:27.450 --> 00:15:29.300
We're going to talk about
recruiting, some of the

00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:31.970
activities that we do, things
like I/O and, of course, the

00:15:31.970 --> 00:15:33.880
Google Developer Live
broadcasts and other

00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:34.670
activities.

00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:38.570
And for those who are interested
in applying, we

00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:40.690
will let you know
how that process

00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:42.720
works and what to expect.

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:45.520
One other announcement, that I
forgot to do earlier, was we

00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:48.360
actually have a winner
for a raspberry pie.

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:51.710
And this is somebody who posted
to Google+ with an

00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:55.210
interesting anagram of the
Google Drive SDKs, which

00:15:55.210 --> 00:15:59.510
turned out to be Desk
Evil Do Grogg.

00:15:59.510 --> 00:16:04.520
And so it's K Powell Palmisano,
hopefully I got

00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:05.010
that correct.

00:16:05.010 --> 00:16:07.430
We will reach out to you on
the community and get your

00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:10.780
contact information so we can
send you a raspberry pie.

00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:13.350
And we'll have some more
opportunities for people to

00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:15.860
get those in the future so, of
course, stay tuned and join

00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:16.950
the community.

00:16:16.950 --> 00:16:20.540
And join in next week and learn
more about what life is

00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:23.200
like at Google Developer
Relations.

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:26.260
Brett, thank you very much for
joining us here today.

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:28.790
I know we have lots of cool
stuff that you can do together

00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:31.830
in the future to make it even
easier for developers, so look

00:16:31.830 --> 00:16:34.700
forward to seeing
how things go.

00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:35.510
BRETT VAN ZUIDEN:
You and me both.

00:16:35.510 --> 00:16:36.060
Thanks for having me.

00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:36.550
STEVE BAZYL: All right.

00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:39.660
And thank you Carrie for the
awesome review on Magisto.

00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:40.260
CARRIE ROWE: You're welcome.

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:41.510
Thanks for watching, guys.

00:16:54.660 --> 00:17:43.567
