00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.390
It's an old trope, the hero needs to escape,
so she pulls out a lighter and trips the fire

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:06.830
sprinklers across the whole building --is
that just movie magic?

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:14.099
How do those things know when there's a real
fire around?

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.219
Howdy hotties, thanks for stopping by DNews!

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:17.430
I'm Trace.

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.029
Fire is one of the most serious disasters
facing human construction projects throughout

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.029
history.

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:24.930
Fires destroyed
Constantinople, Rome, Amsterdam, Toyko, Moscow,

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.039
London, San Francisco, Hong Kong, Chicago,
Singapore, Tianjin…

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.689
They can start anywhere and spread anywhere.

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:36.390
Fire Suppression systems are universal in
so many movies and TV shows, but according

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.140
to the National Fire Protection Association
all the sprinklers going off at once is absolutely

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:42.190
a work of fiction…

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:47.620
In the 19th century, textile mills began installing
"perforated pipe systems" which could manually

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.200
be flooded with water to put out a fire before
it got out of hand.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.800
Then, in 1872 the first automatic system was
created, and was perfected two years later

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.250
by the owner of a piano factory named H.S.

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:59.250
Parmelee.

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.930
The system used heat activated material that
released the tension on a spring allowing

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:08.600
the water to flow -- and modern systems (dating
to 1889) pretty much do the same thing, but

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.210
today we use glass to hold back the water…

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.620
Because of this heat-activated bead, only
sprinklers subjected to hundreds of degrees

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.740
will spray water -- not every sprinkler everywhere.

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.760
If you look at a fire sprinkler today, you'll
likely see a tiny glass bead filled with liquid

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.250
or a color coded piece of metal -- called
a fusible link.

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.310
The beads are easiest to spot, and the color
of that bead tells you how hot the ceiling

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.630
can get before that sprinkler will go off.

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.670
These systems work with simple physics, inside
the bead is a glycerin-based liquid (sugar

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.650
alcohol) which expands when heated to a specific
temperature.

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:45.909
That expansion breaks the glass, allowing
what's in the pipe to flow!

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:51.510
A hotel or home goes up in flames more quickly,
and at lower temperatures, than say a factory…

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.380
so different buildings will have different
classifications.

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.970
Red beads break at the lowest temp of 135
to 170 degrees (57-77C)... and they're the

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:00.090
most common.

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.890
Intermediate levels are yellow or green, they
break at 175-225 (79-107C), and the highest

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:12.250
levels for warehouses or factories have black
beads which break at 650 fahrenheit (343C).

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.209
The thing is, what comes out of the sprinkler
doesn't just have to be water.

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:20.950
It can also be inert gas or foam designed
to snuff out really strong fires in sensitive

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:21.950
areas.

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.560
But, if it is liquid, there are two kinds
of suppression systems: wet or dry.

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:32.140
Wet systems have pipes filled at all times,
and dry systems have NOTHING in them until

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.810
a broken bead upsets the vacuum balance.

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.950
Dry systems are better for places where freezing
temperatures could damage the pipes, or perhaps

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.880
where a leak could seriously damage the building
-- like a historic site.

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.130
Now, I know I said otherwise, but there ARE
systems where ALL the sprinklers will turn

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:50.130
on at once.

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.430
They're called DELUGE systems and they're
used in places where huge fires could get

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.970
out of control quickly, like "power plants,
aircraft hangars and chemical storage or processing

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:59.050
facilities."

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:02.660
Not so much, office buildings… even fictional
ones run by spies.

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.849
So next time you're in a hotel, or you spot
a sprinkler head, remember, it's connected

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:10.080
to a massive system of pipes designed to keep
your building from fire harm!

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.450
You can nerd out about the color of the bead,
and scoff at every movie that uses the fire-sprinkler

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:15.450
trope.

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:16.450
You're welcome.

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:17.450
There are other ways to keep an eye on your
home too…

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:18.450
AT&amp;T Digital Life smart home security helps
keep you connected to you home, so there are

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:19.450
no more what ifs.

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:20.450
If you're into crazy things about fire, AND
debunking movies -- you should learn about

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.560
how fire works in space… because again,
pretty much every movie is wrong.

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:43.099
Check out the OLLLLLD video 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:45.800
about it here.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:46.800
Wow. that hair.

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:47.800
What was I thinking?!

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.310
What else do you want to know about the world
around us?

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:54.160
Any other systems you want us to dig into?

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.650
