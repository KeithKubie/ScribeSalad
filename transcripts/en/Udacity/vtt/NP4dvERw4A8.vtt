00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
This is a quick recap. Let's compare the u from 10 minutes ago to the u of now.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
The u who now knows about conservation of energy and gravitational potential energy.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Well, even 10 minutes ago you could have solved the problem with

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
let's say a ball dropping down in free fall.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Ten minutes ago you could have solve that and now could have solve that.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
You know everything that you need to know to describe this motion. What about an incline plane?

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Well 10 minutes ago, I think you could have solve this.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
You know how to break forces down and solve for acceleration

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and so now I see you could solve that as well.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
When an incline plane is in a very realistic shape.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
How often a nature do you see a hill that's perfectly flat at one single angle, not very often.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
More often what you see in nature is weird strange shape like this one

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and if you have a block of mass m on a hill like this,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
could you calculate the speed of the block when it gets to the bottom.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
I think 10 minutes ago, you may not be able to do that but now you can

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
and how are you going to do that?

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Well as long as you know the height of the hill, you know that as the block slides down here

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
well, its potential energy would be described by this equation m&lt;i&gt;g&lt;i&gt;h.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.000
As h goes down, potential energy will go down, but energy is conserved.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
It can't be created. It can't be destroyed.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
If potential energy is going down, kinetic energy must be going up

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
and in fact, at the very bottom of this hill once the block has gotten all the way down here

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
h is zero, so all of the potential energy is gone and converted into kinetic energy.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
We can say that mathematically by saying that the potential energy the block had up here

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
is equal to the kinetic it has down here or mgh=1/2mv²

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
and what do you know the mass tells us.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.000
The mass of the block doesn't matter. We can solve this equation for v to get this wonderful answer.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:52.000
The velocity of this block at the bottom will be the √2&lt;i&gt;g&lt;i&gt;h. This answer is remarkable.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
It doesn't depend on the mass and Galileo knew motion shouldn't really depend on mass.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
It depends on this acceleration due to gravity as we expect it it's higher well the speed is higher.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
It also depends on the height of the hill. Slide it down a higher hill and the velocity is greater.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
This makes a lot of sense--now that your so much smarter than you were 10 minutes ago,

00:02:11.000 --> 99:59:59.000
time to put this skills to use and solve some problems.
