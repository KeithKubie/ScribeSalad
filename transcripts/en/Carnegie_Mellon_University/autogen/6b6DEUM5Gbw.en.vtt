00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:46.130
heroic assumption there that we could
get millions of machines out because

00:14:46.130 --> 00:14:46.140
get millions of machines out because
 

00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:47.510
get millions of machines out because
after all if you want to make it

00:14:47.510 --> 00:14:47.520
after all if you want to make it
 

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:50.060
after all if you want to make it
economic to spend tens of millions

00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:50.070
economic to spend tens of millions
 

00:14:50.070 --> 00:14:53.690
economic to spend tens of millions
developing software and sell it for $100

00:14:53.690 --> 00:14:53.700
developing software and sell it for $100
 

00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:56.990
developing software and sell it for $100
or so you've really got to get that base

00:14:56.990 --> 00:14:57.000
or so you've really got to get that base
 

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.630
or so you've really got to get that base
out there but because we made that bet

00:14:59.630 --> 00:14:59.640
out there but because we made that bet
 

00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:02.630
out there but because we made that bet
we got that going it became a virtuous

00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:02.640
we got that going it became a virtuous
 

00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:05.060
we got that going it became a virtuous
cycle that is as more machines would

00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:05.070
cycle that is as more machines would
 

00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:07.520
cycle that is as more machines would
sell it created the market for a broader

00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:07.530
sell it created the market for a broader
 

00:15:07.530 --> 00:15:10.790
sell it created the market for a broader
range of software and that further drove

00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:10.800
range of software and that further drove
 

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:12.320
range of software and that further drove
the market for the machines and in fact

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:12.330
the market for the machines and in fact
 

00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:14.810
the market for the machines and in fact
that volume allowed the price of the

00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:14.820
that volume allowed the price of the
 

00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:18.370
that volume allowed the price of the
machine to come down and that's why from

00:15:18.370 --> 00:15:18.380
machine to come down and that's why from
 

00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:21.170
machine to come down and that's why from
1975 onward that personal computer

00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:21.180
1975 onward that personal computer
 

00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:23.410
1975 onward that personal computer
market actually not only became

00:15:23.410 --> 00:15:23.420
market actually not only became
 

00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:26.030
market actually not only became
significant it actually became the

00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:26.040
significant it actually became the
 

00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:27.319

center of the entire

00:15:27.319 --> 00:15:27.329
center of the entire
 

00:15:27.329 --> 00:15:29.989
center of the entire
computer industry the large machines we

00:15:29.989 --> 00:15:29.999
computer industry the large machines we
 

00:15:29.999 --> 00:15:33.400
computer industry the large machines we
use today and the big server farms or

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:33.410
use today and the big server farms or
 

00:15:33.410 --> 00:15:36.199
use today and the big server farms or
corporate data servers these are all

00:15:36.199 --> 00:15:36.209
corporate data servers these are all
 

00:15:36.209 --> 00:15:39.129
corporate data servers these are all
based on the Windows PC architecture

00:15:39.129 --> 00:15:39.139
based on the Windows PC architecture
 

00:15:39.139 --> 00:15:42.319
based on the Windows PC architecture
which because of its volume has come

00:15:42.319 --> 00:15:42.329
which because of its volume has come
 

00:15:42.329 --> 00:15:43.809
which because of its volume has come
down in price and improved in

00:15:43.809 --> 00:15:43.819
down in price and improved in
 

00:15:43.819 --> 00:15:47.090
down in price and improved in
performance very very dramatically and

00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:47.100
performance very very dramatically and
 

00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:50.269
performance very very dramatically and
so we have a large software industry

00:15:50.269 --> 00:15:50.279
so we have a large software industry
 

00:15:50.279 --> 00:15:51.619
so we have a large software industry

only in 300 million locations we had a
 

00:16:25.949 --> 00:16:28.340
only in 300 million locations we had a
million people having access so that's a

00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:28.350
million people having access so that's a
 

00:16:28.350 --> 00:16:30.410

the reasons why we have what I would

00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:31.770
the reasons why we have what I would
 

00:41:31.770 --> 00:41:34.700
the reasons why we have what I would
refer to as a market failure that is the

market directs itself to solve problems
based on economic signals and so the top

00:41:41.660 --> 00:41:41.670
based on economic signals and so the top
 

00:41:41.670 --> 00:41:43.490
based on economic signals and so the top
two billion can send very strong

00:41:43.490 --> 00:41:43.500
two billion can send very strong
 

00:41:43.500 --> 00:41:45.410
two billion can send very strong
economic signals a good example of that

00:41:45.410 --> 00:41:45.420
economic signals a good example of that
 

00:41:45.420 --> 00:41:48.350
economic signals a good example of that
is these top two Billy

00:41:48.350 --> 00:41:48.360
is these top two Billy

is these top two Billy
they don't like being bald and so

00:41:50.570 --> 00:41:50.580
they don't like being bald and so
 

00:41:50.580 --> 00:41:54.170
they don't like being bald and so
billions are being spent on curing

got their money out on the table and

00:41:59.300 --> 00:41:59.310
got their money out on the table and
 

00:41:59.310 --> 00:42:01.670
got their money out on the table and
that's great someday I think they'll

00:42:01.670 --> 00:42:01.680
that's great someday I think they'll
 

00:42:01.680 --> 00:42:04.210
that's great someday I think they'll
solve that the bottom 2 billion a

poor countries and now we have a
 

00:42:51.630 --> 00:42:54.590
poor countries and now we have a
complete distribution even within

that bottom part there are a few areas

00:43:02.660 --> 00:43:02.670
that bottom part there are a few areas
 

00:43:02.670 --> 00:43:04.900
that bottom part there are a few areas
that are heavily represented

that are heavily represented
 

00:43:04.910 --> 00:43:08.090

rapid improvement you know if you take

00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:14.250
rapid improvement you know if you take

out say Afghanistan and Yemen and you're

00:43:17.030 --> 00:43:17.040
out say Afghanistan and Yemen and you're
 

00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:18.950
out say Afghanistan and Yemen and you're
really looking at the toughest things it

00:43:18.950 --> 00:43:18.960
really looking at the toughest things it
 

00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:21.220
really looking at the toughest things it
you're overwhelmingly talking about

00:43:21.220 --> 00:43:21.230
you're overwhelmingly talking about
 

00:43:21.230 --> 00:43:23.660
you're overwhelmingly talking about
sub-saharan Africa so we need to do

00:43:23.660 --> 00:43:23.670
sub-saharan Africa so we need to do
 

00:43:23.670 --> 00:43:27.220
sub-saharan Africa so we need to do
something to try and get this innovation

00:43:27.220 --> 00:43:27.230
something to try and get this innovation
 

00:43:27.230 --> 00:43:31.220
something to try and get this innovation
to apply to these problems and I'm

00:43:31.220 --> 00:43:31.230
to apply to these problems and I'm
 

00:43:31.230 --> 00:43:33.020
to apply to these problems and I'm
really pleased to see that there is a

00:43:33.020 --> 00:43:33.030
really pleased to see that there is a
 

00:43:33.030 --> 00:43:36.410
really pleased to see that there is a
growing awareness of those problems and

00:43:36.410 --> 00:43:36.420
growing awareness of those problems and
 

00:43:36.420 --> 00:43:38.920
growing awareness of those problems and
a growing willingness to put energy into

00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:38.930
a growing willingness to put energy into
 

00:43:38.930 --> 00:43:40.820
a growing willingness to put energy into
thinking about them and thinking about

00:43:40.820 --> 00:43:40.830
thinking about them and thinking about
 

00:43:40.830 --> 00:43:44.540
thinking about them and thinking about
where innovation can help for myself I

00:43:44.540 --> 00:43:44.550
where innovation can help for myself I
 

00:43:44.550 --> 00:43:48.140
where innovation can help for myself I
grab a left the university without any

00:43:48.140 --> 00:43:48.150
grab a left the university without any
 

00:43:48.150 --> 00:43:49.850
grab a left the university without any
awareness of the conditions of the

00:43:49.850 --> 00:43:49.860
awareness of the conditions of the
 

00:43:49.860 --> 00:43:51.950
awareness of the conditions of the
poorest to billions if you'd asked me I

00:43:51.950 --> 00:43:51.960
poorest to billions if you'd asked me I
 

00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:52.850
poorest to billions if you'd asked me I
would have said yeah I guess they have

00:43:52.850 --> 00:43:52.860
would have said yeah I guess they have
 

00:43:52.860 --> 00:43:56.120
would have said yeah I guess they have
less food less electricity and things

00:43:56.120 --> 00:43:56.130
less food less electricity and things
 

00:43:56.130 --> 00:43:58.490
less food less electricity and things
but I didn't really understand the trap

00:43:58.490 --> 00:43:58.500
but I didn't really understand the trap
 

00:43:58.500 --> 00:44:01.250
but I didn't really understand the trap
that exists there in the the nature of

00:44:01.250 --> 00:44:01.260
that exists there in the the nature of
 

00:44:01.260 --> 00:44:01.690
that exists there in the the nature of
those

00:44:01.690 --> 00:44:01.700
those
 

00:44:01.700 --> 00:44:05.650
those
it was 15 years later that I was reading

00:44:05.650 --> 00:44:05.660
it was 15 years later that I was reading
 

00:44:05.660 --> 00:44:08.230
it was 15 years later that I was reading
a newspaper article that talked about

00:44:08.230 --> 00:44:08.240
a newspaper article that talked about
 

00:44:08.240 --> 00:44:10.210
a newspaper article that talked about
rotavirus and said it killed the half a

00:44:10.210 --> 00:44:10.220
rotavirus and said it killed the half a
 

00:44:10.220 --> 00:44:13.120
rotavirus and said it killed the half a
million children here and I thought well

00:44:13.120 --> 00:44:13.130
million children here and I thought well
 

00:44:13.130 --> 00:44:16.140
million children here and I thought well
what's rotavirus I've never heard of it

00:44:16.140 --> 00:44:16.150
what's rotavirus I've never heard of it
 

00:44:16.150 --> 00:44:18.790
what's rotavirus I've never heard of it
is somebody working on it well it turned

00:44:18.790 --> 00:44:18.800
is somebody working on it well it turned
 

00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:21.540
is somebody working on it well it turned
out at the time basically nobody was

00:44:21.540 --> 00:44:21.550
out at the time basically nobody was
 

00:44:21.550 --> 00:44:24.220
out at the time basically nobody was
because again it's a case where there's

00:44:24.220 --> 00:44:24.230
because again it's a case where there's
 

00:44:24.230 --> 00:44:27.280
because again it's a case where there's
no signal that says that's something of

00:44:27.280 --> 00:44:27.290
no signal that says that's something of
 

00:44:27.290 --> 00:44:29.440
no signal that says that's something of
importance and it ought to be pulled

00:44:29.440 --> 00:44:29.450
importance and it ought to be pulled
 

00:44:29.450 --> 00:44:34.000
importance and it ought to be pulled
together and so I think if you go back

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:34.010
together and so I think if you go back
 

00:44:34.010 --> 00:44:37.920
together and so I think if you go back
ten years ago is very easy for somebody

00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:37.930
ten years ago is very easy for somebody
 

00:44:37.930 --> 00:44:40.420
ten years ago is very easy for somebody
going to college even somebody going to

00:44:40.420 --> 00:44:40.430
going to college even somebody going to
 

00:44:40.430 --> 00:44:42.430
going to college even somebody going to
a medical school where you think a lot

00:44:42.430 --> 00:44:42.440
a medical school where you think a lot
 

00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:45.640
a medical school where you think a lot
of these problems would be highlighted

00:44:45.640 --> 00:44:45.650
of these problems would be highlighted
 

00:44:45.650 --> 00:44:46.930
of these problems would be highlighted
in a fairly dramatic way it's very

00:44:46.930 --> 00:44:46.940
in a fairly dramatic way it's very
 

00:44:46.940 --> 00:44:49.240
in a fairly dramatic way it's very
possible not to know much about them I

00:44:49.240 --> 00:44:49.250
possible not to know much about them I
 

00:44:49.250 --> 00:44:51.430
possible not to know much about them I
think that is changing I see the

00:44:51.430 --> 00:44:51.440
think that is changing I see the
 

00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:53.350
think that is changing I see the
interest level of course the

00:44:53.350 --> 00:44:53.360
interest level of course the
 

00:44:53.360 --> 00:44:54.760
interest level of course the
availability through the internet to

00:44:54.760 --> 00:44:54.770
availability through the internet to
 

00:44:54.770 --> 00:44:56.890
availability through the internet to
learn about these things the desire to

00:44:56.890 --> 00:44:56.900
learn about these things the desire to
 

00:44:56.900 --> 00:44:59.290
learn about these things the desire to
get out and see some of these conditions

00:44:59.290 --> 00:44:59.300
get out and see some of these conditions
 

00:44:59.300 --> 00:45:01.930
get out and see some of these conditions
is much stronger today I was meeting

00:45:01.930 --> 00:45:01.940
is much stronger today I was meeting
 

00:45:01.940 --> 00:45:03.550
is much stronger today I was meeting
with some of the students who are

00:45:03.550 --> 00:45:03.560
with some of the students who are
 

00:45:03.560 --> 00:45:06.100
with some of the students who are
working on the the thing called tech

00:45:06.100 --> 00:45:06.110
working on the the thing called tech
 

00:45:06.110 --> 00:45:08.830
working on the the thing called tech
bridge here which is aimed at thinking

00:45:08.830 --> 00:45:08.840
bridge here which is aimed at thinking
 

00:45:08.840 --> 00:45:11.290
bridge here which is aimed at thinking
through what what are those needs and

00:45:11.290 --> 00:45:11.300
through what what are those needs and
 

00:45:11.300 --> 00:45:14.200
through what what are those needs and
where they can be addressed I've seen

00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:14.210
where they can be addressed I've seen
 

00:45:14.210 --> 00:45:15.790
where they can be addressed I've seen
some wonderful projects that are

00:45:15.790 --> 00:45:15.800
some wonderful projects that are
 

00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:19.030
some wonderful projects that are
actually out being out getting out large

numbers and sometimes they're not cool

00:45:22.660 --> 00:45:22.670
numbers and sometimes they're not cool
 

00:45:22.670 --> 00:45:25.270
numbers and sometimes they're not cool
because of the technology they're really
