00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:03.600
NARRATOR: 10 miles up and in the
path of an oncoming Montana

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.500
storm, Jake's top
tracker Clutch has

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.870
cornered a lion for the
second time in just two hours.

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:10.770
All right.

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:12.270
I see Clutch right here.

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:14.200
NARRATOR: And he's
not giving up.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.570
We're about 80
yards, and the cat's

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.200
just about 14 feet above him.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.100
NARRATOR: The dogs are
trained to stay on a lion

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.870
until Jake releases them.

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:23.970
He's doing a good job.

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.270
The cat's focused on him.

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:28.630
NARRATOR: But after three
chases in a single day,

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:30.430
Jake can't afford another.

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:33.630
It's really important that I
sneak in here quietly and grab.

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.870
'Cause if she jumps again,
we could be in for a long,

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:38.830
long night.

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:41.170
[barking]

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:50.000
[growling]

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.730
[barking]

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.700
Good boy, Clutch.

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.670
Good boy.

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:59.670
Good boy, Clutch, man.

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.800
Clutch, he's climbing, and
I've got to tie him up quick.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:07.770
Clutch.

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.670
Come here, bud.

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.570
Clutch.
Hey.

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.170
Clutch, come on down.

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.430
Hey.

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.070
Clutch.

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.370
See, this is kind of
what I don't want here.

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:22.100
He's high enough now
that I can't reach him.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.370
And when he falls, he's
gonna make a hell of a fall.

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.330
Dogs climbing trees is
definitely not a good habit.

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.270
They want these dogs to be as
aggressive as I can get them,

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.600
but that definitely comes
with a little bit of risk.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:38.930
Come here.
Clutch.

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.530
Clutch.
Come here.

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.900
I just need to get my hands on
Clutch before that lion jumps.

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:49.930
The sun's burning away fast,
so we're running out of light.

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:51.330
Clutch, man.

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:52.770
Come here, bud.

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:53.970
Come here, bud.

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.300
Clutch.

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.200
Ooh, this is gonna hurt.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.130
Oh!

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.100
You're not supposed
to jump over me, bud.

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.570
Good boy.

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.670
Good boy.

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.330
Well, that was successful,
believe it or not.

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:11.530
All right.

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.700
Well, it's time to make
it off the mountain here.

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:16.800
Good boy, Clutch.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.070
Come on.

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.170
NARRATOR: With the lion
retreating far off the ranch,

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.000
the threat is
finally contained--

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.370
for today.

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.230
It's been a very,
very successful season.

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.700
And I definitely
established my name,

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.000
and I'm growing more
of a reputation.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.370
Good boy.

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:33.730
Let's go.

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.100
Come on, Clutch, man.

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.430
Load up.

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.330
The biggest thing is
when you get that call,

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.000
you gotta be ready
and drop everything

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.470
and go make it
happen, tree that cat

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.800
and just take care
of the problem.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.130
When the snow melts,
hopefully the lions

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.530
end up following the game
up and out of the valleys

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:54.630
to the top of the mountain.

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.700
But if they don't, we'll
be waiting for him.
