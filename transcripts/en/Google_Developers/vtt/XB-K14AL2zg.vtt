00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:07.030
This is your weekly update
on the coolest developer

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:08.740

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:11.380
Fast Pair is a set of
specs that make it easier

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:13.630

and speakers to Android

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:14.660
devices.

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:16.510
And we recently made
it easier for users

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:19.000
to connect Fast-Pair-compatible
accessories to devices

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
associated with the
same Google account.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.740
Fast Pair will
connect accessories

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.440
to a user's current and
future Android phones

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.300
with Android 6.0 and higher.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.180

gives you the freedom to
deeply explore your data.

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.950
With Data Studio, you can
make custom dashboards

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.420

data that fit

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.400

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.470
We recently launched
the Data Studio template

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:25.750

possible with Crashlytics

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:26.800

You know, people they--
when you actually

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.870
use this sort of
voice, they listen.

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:09.960
It's-- it's proven.
