00:00:01.834 --> 00:00:04.334
(light music)

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.490
- Welcome to a Conversation with History.

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:32.120
I'm Harry Kreisler of the Institute

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:33.620
of International Studies.

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.530
Our guest today is Elizabeth Warren who

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.550
is Leo Gottlieb Professor
of Law at Harvard University

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:45.550
and the 2007 Jefferson lecturer
on the Berkeley campus.

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.830
In addition to her legal publications she

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:52.400
has written two books, The Two-Income Trap

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.720
and All Your Worth.

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:00.720
Both co-authored by Amelia Warren Tyagi

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.203
and I will show one of those books now.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.040
Professor Warren, welcome to Berkeley.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.680
- Thank you, its a pleasure to be here.

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.200
- Where were you born and raised?

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.670
- Born and raised in Oklahoma.

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.930
- And looking back how do
you think your parents shaped

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.370
your thinking about the world?

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:22.370
- Ah, well my parents
were from Depression era,

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.780
dust bowl Oklahoma and that
shapes your life growing up.

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.290
I was the last of four children.

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.870
I have three much older brothers.

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:37.690
And by the time I came
along I was really kind

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:39.653
of the second family for them.

00:01:41.976 --> 00:01:44.960
They hadn't recovered from the Depression

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.910
and I guess in many ways the never did.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.350
They were, they talked about it.

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.560
Those were the stories that
permeated my childhood.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.160
What it was like to have
seven years of drought.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:59.880
What it was like when
nobody had any money.

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.400
What it was like when
all your neighbors left

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.370
to go to California or
someplace where they thought

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:07.020
there might be jobs.

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.150
My parents hung on, they stayed.

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:12.043
My father worked a
series of different jobs.

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.950
He was a maintenance man
in an apartment house

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.523
was his last job.

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:23.990
But they always saw themselves
as middle class people.

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.270
They saw themselves as people who,

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.870
for them the distinction
was they used good English.

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.030
And they didn't say ain't.

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.000
And those were important indicia

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.480
of middle classness to my folks.

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.480
And they believed in
education and were very proud

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.560
of this little daughter they had.

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.560
- And around the dinner
table was there discussion

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.560
of politics, of law, or did
that all come to you later?

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.070
- Oh no, not around the dinner table.

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:59.480
Mostly around the dinner
table it was discussion

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:04.480
of cars, or rodeos, and
dogs and cows and horses

00:03:07.403 --> 00:03:12.403
and a little discussion of worry
about others in the family.

00:03:17.614 --> 00:03:19.810
There was always a big sense in my family

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.390
of we all kind of tried
to look out for each other

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:24.640
but there was nobody in
the family who really

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.233
had much of anything.

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:31.050
- A theme that you pursue in these books

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:32.410
that we're gonna talk about

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.807
is what's happening to the family.

00:03:34.807 --> 00:03:39.378
I, from what you're
saying now I get the sense

00:03:39.378 --> 00:03:43.270
that the family was very important

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:48.190
as a last resort for
survival in the context

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:49.840
of these very harsh times.

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.010
- Yeah, I think that's exactly right.

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:56.170
That people who didn't have family

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:58.403
or people who broke from their family,

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.000
they were the true poor.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.310
They were the ones with nothing.

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.620
But so long as you had family you

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.280
had people who would make sure

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.110
that you got fed one way or another.

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:13.810
You know, family was
about canning peaches.

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.210
And canning peaches was about making sure

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:20.330
that there'd at least be
something come next November

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:24.713
when it was cold outside and
there were no crops coming in.

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.530
Family is the heart of what it's about.

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:31.240
- Did you have any
teachers as a young person

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.870
before you went off to college who sort

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.420
of shaped your thinking also about

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:38.500
the kind of career you might take?

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:42.013
- Well it was, I had wonderful teachers.

00:04:42.013 --> 00:04:46.440
I'm of that generation where
there are only two things

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.510
that a woman could do if she wanted

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:51.000
to do something other than stay home

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.190
and that was she could become a nurse

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:53.880
or she could become a teacher.

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:58.880
And so there was some awfully
able women who taught me

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:04.600
from grade school on and
what they opened me up

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.580
to was the possibility that
I too could be a teacher.

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:10.190
And frankly, that's when I
went off, when I went off

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:13.700
to college the whole idea was
so that I could be a teacher.

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:15.180
That's what I wanted to do.

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:16.690
I just didn't quite know what kind

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:19.220
of teacher I ended up becoming, so.

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:21.710
- And at college what did you major in

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:25.022
and what were the focus of your interests?

00:05:25.022 --> 00:05:29.510
- I came to college on
a debate scholarship.

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:32.320
I was 16 years old when I
graduated from high school

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:35.330
and I got a full scholarship in debate

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:37.030
that was room, board, tuition, books,

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:38.520
and a little spending money.

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:41.150
It was a fabulous scholarship.

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:45.630
At George Washington University
if I would debate for them.

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:48.910
It was sort of the equivalent
of an athletic scholarship

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:51.623
only this one that
actually a girl could get.

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:55.900
Even though there weren't very
many girls in debate either.

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:59.110
I was gonna be a teacher
and I quickly switched over

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:01.240
and decided what I wanted to do was work

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.060
with brain injured children.

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:08.060
So I got my degree in speech
pathology and audiology.

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:10.295
Which meant that I would be able to work

00:06:10.295 --> 00:06:14.250
with children who had head trauma

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:17.420
and other kinds of brain injuries.

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:18.253
And that's what I did.

00:06:18.253 --> 00:06:19.280
- Um-hm, for awhile.

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:21.280
I mean you actually pursued that career?

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:23.170
- I actually did.

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:26.108
I was married at 19 and then graduated

00:06:26.108 --> 00:06:29.740
from college actually after I'd married.

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:34.740
And my first year post
graduation I worked,

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:37.640
it was in a public school
system but I worked

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:40.800
with the children with disabilities

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:44.023
and I did that for a year.

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:49.410
And then that summer
I actually didn't have

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:50.920
the education courses so I was

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:53.120
on an emergency certificate it was called.

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:55.720
And I went back to graduate school

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:57.780
and took a couple of courses in education

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:01.223
and said I don't think this
is gonna work out for me.

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:04.910
And I was pregnant with my first baby.

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:09.650
So I had a baby and stayed
home for a couple of years

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:14.613
and I was really casting about
thinking, what am I gonna do?

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:18.293
And my husband's view
of it was, stay at home.

00:07:19.182 --> 00:07:21.290
You know, we have children
we'll have more children.

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:22.863
You'll love this.

00:07:22.863 --> 00:07:25.340
And I was very restless about it.

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:28.820
And so I went back home to Oklahoma.

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:30.320
By this point we were living in New Jersey

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:31.160
because of his job.

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:34.326
I went back home to Oklahoma for Christmas

00:07:34.326 --> 00:07:36.390
and saw a bunch of the boys that I'd been

00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:38.610
in high school debate
with and they'd all gone

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:41.770
on to law school and they said
you should go to law school.

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:42.770
You'll love it.

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:44.377
And I said, you really think so?

00:07:44.377 --> 00:07:46.510
And they said, of all
of us you should've gone

00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:47.343
to law school.

00:07:47.343 --> 00:07:49.590
You're the one who should've
gone to law school.

00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:53.680
So I took the tests, applied to law school

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:56.870
and the day my daughter who
later became my co-author

00:07:56.870 --> 00:08:01.210
turned two, on her second
birthday, I started law school

00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:05.180
at Rutgers Law School in New Jersey.

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:08.020
Which at the time had
the nickname of being

00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:10.690
the people's electric law company.

00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:14.240
- I see, all the lawyers for the, yeah.

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:17.080
- That's right, these were the kind

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:18.500
of wild and crazy lawyers.

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:22.720
Arthur Kinoy who was
just a wonderful figure

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:24.850
and had been very active in
the civil rights movement.

00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:29.600
Its a very small law school
and I'd never met a lawyer.

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:33.823
I mean I never, I didn't
travel in those circles.

00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:39.520
And I took to law school
like a pig takes to mud.

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:44.520
I mean this was fabulous,
I loved law school.

00:08:44.846 --> 00:08:47.750
And then my third year,
final year in law school

00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:52.230
I got pregnant again
and I didn't take a job.

00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:55.840
Alex was born about three
weeks after I graduated

00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:58.980
and it was the hardest moment in my life

00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:02.960
because I thought that this
world that had opened up

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:06.960
to me, this world of
ideas and law was a tool.

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:08.893
You could make things happen with it.

00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:12.480
I thought, because I
didn't take a job right out

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:15.420
of law school, it was all over.

00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:16.660
I just kissed it all good bye.

00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:18.420
I stepped off the train
and would never have

00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:20.370
a chance to get back on it.

00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:25.030
So I took the bar, hung out a shingle

00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:26.640
in northern New Jersey.

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:31.640
Did real estate closings
and little incorporations

00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:34.080
and lawsuits, all on the civil side.

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:37.000
And raised my two babies.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.380
And then Rutgers called and
said somebody didn't show up

00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:44.220
to teach a class, would you like to come

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:46.750
and teach it and start Thursday?

00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:49.483
And I said, yeah.

00:09:50.390 --> 00:09:51.740
How hard could it be, right?

00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:56.040
And so I started teaching
and then my husband

00:09:56.040 --> 00:10:01.040
got transferred to Houston
and I got my first full-time

00:10:01.210 --> 00:10:02.870
tenure track teaching job, teaching

00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:04.320
at the University of Houston.

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:09.620
We ended up divorcing and then I went

00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:11.873
to the University of Texas, I remarried.

00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:14.100
Went to the University of Michigan.

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:16.330
Went to the University of
Pennsylvania, went to Harvard.

00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:17.163
- And now at Harvard.

00:10:17.163 --> 00:10:17.996
- [Elizabeth] And now I'm at Harvard.

00:10:17.996 --> 00:10:19.400
Isn't that an amazing story?

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:23.720
- It is, and one of the
things that I hear here

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:27.360
is you're, this is kind of a turning point

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:32.360
in women seeing a different
role for themselves.

00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:37.380
I'm curious, what do you see in addition

00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:41.020
to the opportunity that
was suddenly presented

00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:45.520
in your background that made you able

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:47.550
to seize these opportunities?

00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:52.530
- You know, partly my
mother always just said

00:10:52.530 --> 00:10:54.083
that I was just contrary.

00:10:55.790 --> 00:10:57.460
That some kids are just born that way.

00:10:57.460 --> 00:11:00.650
That she, families tell stories

00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:03.300
and those stories are, I
think both reflect what

00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:05.307
the children are and then they
shape what the children are.

00:11:05.307 --> 00:11:08.980
And the story that was always
told when I was very little

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:11.580
is that my mother when I was about two

00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:13.870
and a half I would be allowed to play

00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:15.700
in the front yard but she
would tell me don't go

00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:16.563
into the street.

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:21.490
And I would look at her and
wait until she turned her back

00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:22.800
and step right in the street.

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:24.150
I would just stand in the street.

00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:26.130
Just a little bit, just on the curb,

00:11:26.130 --> 00:11:28.120
but I would stand in the street.

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:30.610
And my mother was big on switches.

00:11:30.610 --> 00:11:33.960
She'd pull a switch off
a tree and just switch

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:35.530
the backs of my legs.

00:11:35.530 --> 00:11:39.593
And I'd cry and she'd tell
me not to go in the street.

00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:43.170
I'd cry and I'd step
right back in the street.

00:11:43.170 --> 00:11:46.660
And finally my mother said, she realized I

00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:47.510
was gonna go in street.

00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:48.880
So she said, okay so here are the rules

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:49.740
for going in the street.

00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:51.930
You look this way, you look that way.

00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:53.187
But here's how you safely go in street.

00:11:53.187 --> 00:11:55.170
You go on the other side,
you never wanna stand

00:11:55.170 --> 00:11:56.230
in the street, gave me all
the rules for the street.

00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:58.340
And I was perfectly happy.

00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:03.340
And I think partly it was that
I always had my neck bowed.

00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:06.560
I was always gonna do something else.

00:12:07.730 --> 00:12:09.750
When we were able to pick an elective

00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:11.180
and all the girls picked drama I,

00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:12.630
of course had to pick debate.

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:16.560
When you know all the girls dropped out

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:18.560
of doing something I said
I was gonna take physics.

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:20.240
You know, just because.

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:22.950
So there was a little
bit of the just because.

00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:25.600
And it was a moment, it was a moment.

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:27.770
When Gloria Steinem was out there talking

00:12:28.728 --> 00:12:29.870
did I think that I was going to be

00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:33.510
one of those women's liber's, heaven's no.

00:12:33.510 --> 00:12:35.580
I wanted children, I wanted a family.

00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:38.720
And I somehow thought those
were either or choices

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:42.003
and yet I wanted to do things.

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:44.770
And I just got lucky.

00:12:44.770 --> 00:12:48.265
- Adventuresome,
adventuresome and courageous.

00:12:48.265 --> 00:12:50.670
- Well I don't know, I never
thought of it that way.

00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:52.977
I just thought of it as--

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:57.550
I once was at a friend's house and I saw

00:12:57.550 --> 00:12:59.080
that they had wallpaper in their bathroom

00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:01.780
and I thought it was the
coolest thing I'd ever seen.

00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:05.440
So I came home and I went to Sears.

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:09.350
And I saw this brochure on
how you could do wallpaper

00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:11.770
and I took my baby sitting money

00:13:11.770 --> 00:13:14.170
and I bought enough wallpaper
to wallpaper our bathroom

00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:16.240
and I announced at the
dinner table two weeks later

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:18.170
when it came in, I said,
I've bought wallpaper

00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:19.720
so we can wallpaper the bathroom.

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:24.555
And my daddy said, nobody
knows in our family, see

00:13:24.555 --> 00:13:26.380
because it was always a family, nobody

00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:28.270
in our family knows how to wallpaper.

00:13:28.270 --> 00:13:29.870
He said what are you doing?

00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:32.820
And I said, how hard could it be?

00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:34.430
People dumber than us do it everyday.

00:13:34.430 --> 00:13:38.400
So its always been a kind of
a, you know you get out there

00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:39.810
and try it, the worst
that happens is you make

00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:42.400
a mess out of it and have
to throw it away, so.

00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:43.233
- [Harry] Try it.

00:13:43.233 --> 00:13:44.066
- Yeah.

00:13:44.066 --> 00:13:46.343
- So what does it take to be a lawyer?

00:13:49.466 --> 00:13:52.700
What are the skills,
what is the temperament?

00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:57.700
- You know, law is so multifaceted.

00:13:58.760 --> 00:13:59.950
Its almost like saying what does

00:13:59.950 --> 00:14:01.763
it take to be a college graduate?

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:05.850
Law is an advanced degree in thinking

00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:11.060
and the practice of law can
mean so many different things.

00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:14.760
There are lawyers who are
transactional lawyers.

00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:16.363
They put deals together.

00:14:16.363 --> 00:14:19.500
They're energetic, they're creative.

00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:21.670
That's how they use what they've got.

00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:24.640
There are lawyers who are trial lawyers.

00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:26.740
They're argumentative
and aggressive and quick

00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:29.060
and that's how they use
their talents and energies.

00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:33.200
There are lawyers who are
those detail oriented.

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:37.160
Watch every last comma, every last period,

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:39.860
and see how something fits into this slot

00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:40.963
and not that slot.

00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:44.150
There are lawyers who
are just good counselors

00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:45.040
to other people.

00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:49.380
They understand law but
they have that human part

00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:51.600
that lets them talk.

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:54.750
There are lawyers who see the big policy

00:14:54.750 --> 00:14:57.980
and they wanna think about
how the law should be changed

00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:01.810
or how rules should be
changed and law is the tool

00:15:01.810 --> 00:15:05.170
that lets them look in those directions.

00:15:05.170 --> 00:15:08.480
So there's not only
not one answer to that.

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:11.423
I don't even think there are 10.

00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:16.560
Law's for people who wanna make changes

00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:20.050
at little tiny levels or great big levels

00:15:20.050 --> 00:15:23.710
and they're willing to use words and ideas

00:15:23.710 --> 00:15:25.230
to make those things happen.

00:15:25.230 --> 00:15:27.350
- And you started in
commercial law, really.

00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:32.350
That was what your scholarship
was in but then you moved

00:15:34.010 --> 00:15:36.506
to the public realm.

00:15:36.506 --> 00:15:41.506
So help us understand how
that transition came about.

00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:46.140
Was it the limits of what
the law could achieve

00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:50.040
that you came to see and your
concern about public issues?

00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:55.040
- Well I was doing my research,
happily doing my research

00:15:55.070 --> 00:15:58.270
and you know the nice thing about being

00:15:58.270 --> 00:15:59.940
a professor is you get to work

00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:01.270
on whatever issue you wanna work

00:16:01.270 --> 00:16:03.250
on, however you wanna do it.

00:16:03.250 --> 00:16:06.280
And so I did my very first empirical study

00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:08.770
looking at the families who
were going into bankruptcy

00:16:08.770 --> 00:16:11.080
and I teamed up with a sociologist who was

00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:15.490
a good test design person who
taught me an enormous amount.

00:16:15.490 --> 00:16:17.800
Dr. Terry Sullivan who's now the provost

00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:18.900
at the University of Michigan

00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:21.650
and we were just baby law professors.

00:16:21.650 --> 00:16:23.520
And Jay Westbrook another law professor

00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:25.200
at the University of Texas.

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:28.870
And we put together an empirical study

00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:31.050
for the families who were going bankrupt.

00:16:31.050 --> 00:16:33.260
This is back in the early 80s.

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:36.460
And I'll tell you what I set out to prove.

00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:39.770
I set out to prove they were
all a bunch of cheaters.

00:16:39.770 --> 00:16:44.770
My take on this, my
thrust, what I was gonna do

00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:50.610
is I was gonna expose these
people who were taking advantage

00:16:50.610 --> 00:16:53.240
of the rest of us by
hauling off to bankruptcy

00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:56.080
and discharging debts that
they really could repay.

00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:58.533
Or who'd be irresponsible
in running up debts.

00:17:00.750 --> 00:17:04.150
And I did the research
and the data just took me

00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:06.140
to a totally different place.

00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:10.400
These were hard working,
middle class families who

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:15.400
by in large had lost jobs,
gotten sick, had family breakups

00:17:16.210 --> 00:17:20.460
and that's what was driving
them over the edge financially.

00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:23.230
Most of them were in
complete economic collapse

00:17:23.230 --> 00:17:25.100
when they filed for bankruptcy.

00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:27.360
There was no option to bankruptcy except

00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:30.120
to just stay deep in debt
for the rest of your life.

00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:31.970
They would never pay these debts off.

00:17:32.930 --> 00:17:35.710
And so it changed my vision

00:17:35.710 --> 00:17:37.800
but it certainly didn't
make me want to talk about

00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:39.330
it in a public sense.

00:17:39.330 --> 00:17:44.330
I wrote those academic
articles, academic books.

00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:49.100
Full footnotes, that's what it was about

00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:54.100
and then in 1994 Congress passed

00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:56.280
a law saying they were gonna have

00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:58.830
a commission on bankruptcy.

00:17:58.830 --> 00:18:03.830
And political appointees
and Mike Synar, congressman

00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:07.690
from Oklahoma, had just
been voted out of office

00:18:07.690 --> 00:18:11.800
and President Clinton made him
the head of the commission.

00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:16.070
And Mike came to me and said I want you

00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:18.120
to be the one who comes up with the ideas

00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:19.610
and you know, guides us.

00:18:19.610 --> 00:18:21.760
These are not bankruptcy
specialists, guides us through it,

00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:23.823
helps us with research.

00:18:23.823 --> 00:18:27.023
I said, no, not a
chance, that's political.

00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:31.760
I wanna be pure, I wanna be pristine.

00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:36.030
I don't wanna muddy what I do
with political implications.

00:18:36.030 --> 00:18:38.900
I'm gonna sit here, I'm
gonna do my research.

00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:40.450
I'll turn out the numbers and what you do

00:18:40.450 --> 00:18:42.760
with them is your business.

00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:44.810
- And that's the academic
lawyer saying that?

00:18:44.810 --> 00:18:47.280
- That's right, that was the
academic, academic lawyer.

00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:50.733
Saying and you go do what
you wanna do with it.

00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:56.450
And Mike said, come and do
this so that we have good ideas

00:18:56.450 --> 00:18:58.830
to work with and here's
what I promise you.

00:18:58.830 --> 00:19:01.150
I promise I will totally insulate you

00:19:01.150 --> 00:19:02.650
from the political part.

00:19:02.650 --> 00:19:05.700
You will never be called
on to talk to a reporter.

00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:08.700
You'll never be called on to
get into a political fight

00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:12.690
to make the compromise
to make those decisions.

00:19:12.690 --> 00:19:15.860
Just feed me the good ideas,
feed me the good data.

00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:18.580
I want three good ideas from
you and I'll take 'em out

00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:21.823
and sell 'em in Congress and
sell 'em to my commission.

00:19:23.070 --> 00:19:26.540
And I said yes, finally.

00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:29.120
It was a hard decision for
me 'cause I really felt like

00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:31.470
I'm jumping into a different pool.

00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:36.200
I'm losing this protection
of the ivory tower.

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:38.410
And so I said yes that
I would do it but only

00:19:38.410 --> 00:19:40.760
on the promise that he
would keep me insulated.

00:19:42.050 --> 00:19:46.640
And then he got brain cancer and he died.

00:19:48.603 --> 00:19:51.930
In the space of months, just
as we're getting started

00:19:51.930 --> 00:19:55.890
with this commission and
there were other people

00:19:55.890 --> 00:19:57.750
on the commission who
were perfectly willing

00:19:57.750 --> 00:20:02.710
to take it over and who
frankly in my view, just

00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:04.780
had a totally wrong headed view about

00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:07.557
the families who were in bankruptcy

00:20:07.557 --> 00:20:10.330
and the changes that needed to made.

00:20:10.330 --> 00:20:13.940
And I just looked around and
said, look either I step up

00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:14.773
or nobody does.

00:20:14.773 --> 00:20:16.710
These people are gonna
entirely run this commission

00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:19.190
and use this commission for what I thought

00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:20.593
were very harmful ways.

00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:25.050
And that's when I waded
into the thick of it.

00:20:25.050 --> 00:20:30.050
And started taking much of my research

00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:33.500
and translating it much
more into public policy.

00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:35.480
Here's what we need, here's
why we need it, here's how

00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:38.720
it connects up with the policy decisions

00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:40.880
that we have to make.

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:42.400
- Now if you had stayed

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:45.300
with just this academic lawyer hat

00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:48.910
on and these circumstances hadn't unfolded

00:20:48.910 --> 00:20:53.610
as they did, what route
would your work whether

00:20:53.610 --> 00:20:56.920
on the commission or not, would
it have been well changing

00:20:56.920 --> 00:21:00.350
the wording in these laws or what?

00:21:00.350 --> 00:21:02.610
Where does the law take you?

00:21:02.610 --> 00:21:04.960
- You know that's the amazing part.

00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:08.630
The work would have been
so sterile by comparison

00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:10.350
with what it turned out to be.

00:21:10.350 --> 00:21:12.250
Oh yeah, I'd have had great ideas

00:21:12.250 --> 00:21:17.250
for how 11 US C-13 26
B two double I should

00:21:18.130 --> 00:21:22.713
be modified in order to achieve
a more harmonious result.

00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:29.150
But oddly enough it was
wading into the politics

00:21:29.150 --> 00:21:32.670
and beginning to understand
the rest of this world

00:21:32.670 --> 00:21:34.000
that is what shapes law.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:38.580
Its a law in society point and it began

00:21:39.767 --> 00:21:44.767
the political part ultimately
enriched my understanding

00:21:46.270 --> 00:21:48.310
of the scope of the problems.

00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:50.280
It took me far beyond bankruptcy

00:21:51.410 --> 00:21:54.510
and much more into questions
about what's happening

00:21:54.510 --> 00:21:55.650
to the middle class.

00:21:55.650 --> 00:22:00.650
It was often, in trying to
explain to other people,

00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:03.650
the narrow part that it was other people

00:22:03.650 --> 00:22:05.230
who would ask me the bigger questions.

00:22:05.230 --> 00:22:07.690
So why are families in so much debt?

00:22:07.690 --> 00:22:09.890
So who are these people who
are filing for bankruptcy?

00:22:09.890 --> 00:22:12.880
Or sometimes it would simply
be their allegations of fact.

00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:16.223
Well we know its just the
poor and the profligate.

00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:18.850
That would cause me to say I wanna go back

00:22:18.850 --> 00:22:20.240
and study this some more.

00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:25.240
And so it enriched and
in many ways transformed

00:22:28.010 --> 00:22:30.840
the work that interested me as a scholar.

00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:34.010
So I was a scholar but
I moved into, from kind

00:22:34.010 --> 00:22:37.053
of a one dimensional scholar
into a two dimensional scholar.

00:22:38.770 --> 00:22:42.920
- Before we talk about this
problem of the middle class

00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:45.410
which is the subject of your lecture.

00:22:45.410 --> 00:22:49.500
I wanna explore some of these
elements of the political.

00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:51.520
We've gotten you into the political realm.

00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:53.670
One thing that you mention in your book

00:22:53.670 --> 00:22:57.190
and actually you just said
that your attitude about

00:22:57.190 --> 00:23:00.530
these people who had gone bankrupt was

00:23:00.530 --> 00:23:02.570
that it was their fault.

00:23:02.570 --> 00:23:06.240
That they had failed, that
they had been spenders.

00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:11.130
That they had been
whatever negative values

00:23:11.130 --> 00:23:11.980
we can associate.

00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:16.980
Now, that serves a political
purpose to believe that.

00:23:17.670 --> 00:23:19.180
Even if it's correct.

00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:24.020
Did you begin to put
those two things together?

00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:29.020
- Absolutely, that's how it began to work.

00:23:29.060 --> 00:23:32.580
I began to see that there were a lot

00:23:32.580 --> 00:23:35.980
of people who really just didn't
care, one way or the other

00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:38.930
who the people were
who were in bankruptcy.

00:23:38.930 --> 00:23:41.010
They'd taken a lot of money from the banks

00:23:41.010 --> 00:23:43.380
and the banks had said,
the credit card companies

00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:45.050
had said this is the piece

00:23:45.050 --> 00:23:47.820
of legislation we want,
we find it helpful.

00:23:47.820 --> 00:23:52.333
Well in a democratically
elected congress how

00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:56.020
on earth are you gonna pass legislation

00:23:56.020 --> 00:24:01.020
to benefit two dozen, already
powerful multi-billion dollar

00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:05.470
corporations at the expense of all

00:24:05.470 --> 00:24:07.350
the people who are your constituents?

00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:09.750
'Cause this is a straight wealth transfer.

00:24:09.750 --> 00:24:11.750
Is it gonna go to the
credit card companies

00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:15.480
or is the money gonna
stay with these million

00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:17.390
and a half little families that are filing

00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:18.690
for bankruptcy every year?

00:24:21.850 --> 00:24:24.510
So they would just make
these assertions about who

00:24:24.510 --> 00:24:26.350
these people were.

00:24:26.350 --> 00:24:30.560
And at first I believed
these were assertions made

00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:33.060
out of ignorance, 'cause frankly I made

00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:35.440
the same assertions 10 years earlier.

00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:38.220
Before I'd studied,
before I'd worked on this.

00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:42.430
And so I'd come in with the
data and say well actually

00:24:42.430 --> 00:24:43.950
let me show you how this works.

00:24:43.950 --> 00:24:47.010
And here's a random
sample of 1250 families

00:24:47.010 --> 00:24:47.970
and here's how they were chosen

00:24:47.970 --> 00:24:48.900
and here's what we know about 'em

00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:51.220
and look at what happened to them.

00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:56.220
And people just didn't wanna hear it.

00:24:56.230 --> 00:25:01.230
And finally it was senators
themselves who said, professor,

00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:08.900
you don't understand, so and
so over here has taken $300000

00:25:10.530 --> 00:25:14.160
from credit card companies and
financial services industry

00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:16.543
over the last so many years.

00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:20.750
And this is something that industry wants.

00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:21.890
They hire lobbyists.

00:25:21.890 --> 00:25:24.370
I see two lobbyists a day in here from

00:25:24.370 --> 00:25:26.970
the financial services
industry to make this happen.

00:25:27.970 --> 00:25:32.085
And so the reality of these families lives

00:25:32.085 --> 00:25:37.085
had to be reshaped to tell a a
politically acceptable story.

00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:41.570
We need to pass this piece of legislation.

00:25:41.570 --> 00:25:43.391
All the arrows run the wrong way, right.

00:25:43.391 --> 00:25:45.690
Its that the credit card companies wanted

00:25:45.690 --> 00:25:48.630
a piece of legislation to cut their losses

00:25:48.630 --> 00:25:50.220
and boost their profits.

00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:52.700
And so the story had to be told that this

00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:57.460
is the fault of these families
who are in financial trouble.

00:25:57.460 --> 00:26:01.883
And you know, I wish that story were true.

00:26:03.180 --> 00:26:06.520
But the data are not just
close on this question.

00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:10.080
The data are just
overwhelming on this question.

00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:12.990
That is just simply not the truth.

00:26:12.990 --> 00:26:17.950
And so I think its part
of a whole larger story

00:26:17.950 --> 00:26:21.890
of we don't have to
provide health insurance

00:26:21.890 --> 00:26:26.890
for folks because decent
people, people who worked hard

00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:32.340
and got an education and
therefore got good jobs already

00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:34.900
have health insurance and
there's just an undertone

00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:38.100
of those who don't have
it probably either made

00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:39.460
the choice not to spend the money

00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:41.900
on it, or have made other bad life choices

00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:44.127
that caused them to be in a
place where they don't get it.

00:26:44.127 --> 00:26:47.010
And you know if that
means they don't get much

00:26:47.010 --> 00:26:48.740
health service or they lose their homes

00:26:48.740 --> 00:26:51.610
if they get sick, its all their choices.

00:26:51.610 --> 00:26:52.653
Its all on them.

00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:56.980
I sure don't need to tax myself to build

00:26:56.980 --> 00:27:01.130
a social safety net for
things that may go wrong

00:27:01.130 --> 00:27:03.373
to any of us, 'cause
it didn't happen to me.

00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:07.860
Its their fault, we have a
lot of control over this.

00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:12.860
- Now the narratives, and
which narrative dominates

00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:15.853
which is what you're talking about here.

00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:21.920
There's some irony here
because, especially

00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:24.260
the conservative forces
in this country talk

00:27:24.260 --> 00:27:27.710
about values, they talk about preserving

00:27:27.710 --> 00:27:31.290
the family, they talk
about all sorts of things

00:27:31.290 --> 00:27:34.620
which suggest that they
would a narrative like

00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:36.720
the one that you're telling.

00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:41.430
But the end result is that the lobbyists

00:27:41.430 --> 00:27:46.430
and the financing of
campaigns, I guess, lead

00:27:47.050 --> 00:27:51.140
the politicians to embrace a narrative

00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:53.140
that is inconsistent with the data.

00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:56.730
And then pass laws and
lets point this out,

00:27:56.730 --> 00:28:00.260
the laws would then change the rules about

00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:02.930
the interest rates that could
be charged on credit cards.

00:28:02.930 --> 00:28:06.190
So its little pieces of detail.

00:28:06.190 --> 00:28:08.020
- That's right, very technical.

00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:11.770
Very hard for the popular
press to write about.

00:28:11.770 --> 00:28:14.690
The changes to the bankruptcy
bill, to take that example,

00:28:14.690 --> 00:28:17.160
but there have been other changes.

00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:22.160
The bill was 1100 pages
long of impenetrable text.

00:28:23.210 --> 00:28:25.560
And it was deliberately written in a way

00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:28.670
that if you weren't a specialist.

00:28:28.670 --> 00:28:31.340
Look, I'm a professor of law at Harvard.

00:28:31.340 --> 00:28:34.570
I've taught this stuff now
for more than 20 years.

00:28:34.570 --> 00:28:35.580
I couldn't read the thing.

00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:37.370
I had to keep one finger in the statute,

00:28:37.370 --> 00:28:38.970
and one finger on the amendment

00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:43.840
and the bill ultimately passed in 2005.

00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:46.700
I wrote, readjusted my case book.

00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:49.173
So I've written a book about the changes.

00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:54.150
And to this day I'm still
finding surprises in it.

00:28:54.150 --> 00:28:55.520
Someone will call me about something

00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:56.970
and I'll pull the
provision out and I'll look

00:28:56.970 --> 00:29:00.763
at it and I'll say oh my gosh,
when did that one slip in?

00:29:02.180 --> 00:29:05.790
This is a case in which literally,

00:29:05.790 --> 00:29:08.150
the lobbyists wrote the bill.

00:29:08.150 --> 00:29:09.573
I'm not being metaphoric here.

00:29:09.573 --> 00:29:11.780
They in fact have bragged about

00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:16.188
it in American Banker's
Association newsletters.

00:29:16.188 --> 00:29:19.720
The lobbyists wrote the bill.

00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:22.350
The credit industry paid for it.

00:29:22.350 --> 00:29:26.210
The campaign contributions
then paved the highway

00:29:26.210 --> 00:29:28.530
for the bill to get passed

00:29:28.530 --> 00:29:31.633
and ordinary families just lost out.

00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:37.100
- Let me show your book
again, The Two-Income Trap.

00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:42.100
And in this book there
are a couple of pages

00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:45.930
on a meeting you had with Hillary Clinton

00:29:45.930 --> 00:29:48.710
and her position on some of these issues

00:29:48.710 --> 00:29:50.340
and how it evolved.

00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:52.170
Tell our audience a little about that

00:29:52.170 --> 00:29:55.940
because what is quite compelling about

00:29:57.040 --> 00:30:01.110
the story is that as smart as Mrs. Clinton

00:30:01.110 --> 00:30:06.110
is and as a person with the right values

00:30:06.780 --> 00:30:10.910
that over time as her
constituency changed she changed.

00:30:10.910 --> 00:30:12.832
- Don't give the story away, that's right.

00:30:12.832 --> 00:30:16.890
So the story is that
when the bankruptcy bill

00:30:16.890 --> 00:30:18.860
is first being proposed.

00:30:18.860 --> 00:30:21.200
This commission I said,
President Clinton appoints

00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:23.850
some folks, the commission gets started.

00:30:23.850 --> 00:30:27.730
And in 1997 commission delivers its report

00:30:27.730 --> 00:30:31.700
and says, basically we need some changes

00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:33.660
to the bankruptcy laws
but frankly they were

00:30:33.660 --> 00:30:34.730
a little bit more pro-consumer.

00:30:34.730 --> 00:30:36.097
We need some pro-consumer changes.

00:30:36.097 --> 00:30:39.040
And a few, lets close up
a couple of loopholes.

00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:40.930
Credit industry said, no, no, no.

00:30:40.930 --> 00:30:43.950
Credit industry says, we
wanna make it a lot tougher

00:30:43.950 --> 00:30:45.503
for families to go bankrupt.

00:30:46.460 --> 00:30:50.020
Quite frankly, bluntly
the Clinton administration

00:30:50.020 --> 00:30:52.500
was quietly supporting them.

00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:54.760
Remember that whole notion
of the new democrats?

00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:58.120
We can, business can count on us.

00:30:58.120 --> 00:31:00.900
The banks can come to us and
we wanna be their friends.

00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:03.730
And the idea was a bankruptcy bill,

00:31:03.730 --> 00:31:05.600
its a bunch of technical
changes, who gets hurt?

00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:08.790
A bunch of people who nobody
pays any attention to.

00:31:08.790 --> 00:31:11.870
And so we'll show that we can play ball.

00:31:11.870 --> 00:31:14.800
It'll go below the radar screen.

00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:15.970
Nobody will ever learn about it.

00:31:15.970 --> 00:31:19.860
So I wrote an op-ed that
ended up in the New York Times

00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:21.700
about how the bill was going

00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:24.320
to disproportionately affect women

00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:27.250
and particularly single
mothers with children.

00:31:27.250 --> 00:31:30.770
And Mrs. Clinton picked up the op-ed.

00:31:30.770 --> 00:31:34.400
And I got a call about a week
or two after the op-ed ran.

00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:37.670
And they said Mrs. Clinton
was gonna be in town giving

00:31:37.670 --> 00:31:39.850
a speech and would I be
willing to meet with her?

00:31:39.850 --> 00:31:41.700
I said, you bet.

00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:43.050
And I said, what's she wanna meet about?

00:31:43.050 --> 00:31:46.093
And they said, she would like you to talk

00:31:46.093 --> 00:31:47.900
to her more about bankruptcy.

00:31:47.900 --> 00:31:49.810
Would you come and be prepared to do that?

00:31:49.810 --> 00:31:52.810
So I show up, we meet
in this tiny little room

00:31:52.810 --> 00:31:55.000
in the back of, behind
the stage on the hotel

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.256
after she's given her speech.

00:31:57.256 --> 00:31:59.040
And I'm armed, I've got my little graphs

00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:01.330
and charts and my whole deal.

00:32:01.330 --> 00:32:02.510
- And all those debating skills.

00:32:02.510 --> 00:32:03.760
- And all those debating skills.

00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:07.880
And I tell ya, she is
probably the quickest person

00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:10.220
I ever have spoken with
in my life about this.

00:32:10.220 --> 00:32:12.920
Boy I'd put it down and
she'd ask questions.

00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:14.050
She'd ask smart questions.

00:32:14.050 --> 00:32:17.460
She didn't know it but she got it, fast.

00:32:17.460 --> 00:32:18.870
To the point that I'd be ready to flip

00:32:18.870 --> 00:32:20.040
the next page and she'd anticipate.

00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:21.860
She said, so that means
what's gonna happen

00:32:21.860 --> 00:32:23.860
on this next, I said that's exactly right.

00:32:23.860 --> 00:32:24.693
She got it.

00:32:24.693 --> 00:32:27.520
So we stand up at the end of this meeting

00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:29.440
and she's being whisked off to the airport

00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:31.593
to go back to Washington and she said,

00:32:32.490 --> 00:32:35.990
we must stop this terrible bill.

00:32:35.990 --> 00:32:38.310
And we stand there, we get
our pictures taken together

00:32:38.310 --> 00:32:40.490
and I think, this is great.

00:32:40.490 --> 00:32:42.970
So I later hear, she goes back
to Washington, I later heard

00:32:42.970 --> 00:32:45.410
from somebody who worked
in the White House

00:32:45.410 --> 00:32:47.330
they described it as there were skid marks

00:32:47.330 --> 00:32:50.580
in the hallway from people
changing their position

00:32:50.580 --> 00:32:52.830
on this bill when Mrs. Clinton got back.

00:32:52.830 --> 00:32:55.640
People had been pushing,
pushing, yeah we're gonna support

00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:59.640
this bill to er, no, no, no
terrible bill, terrible bill.

00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:04.250
And to Mrs. Clinton's
credit, when the bill passed

00:33:04.250 --> 00:33:07.960
the House and the Senate in 2000, one

00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:11.450
of President Clinton's
last acts as President

00:33:11.450 --> 00:33:14.490
of the United States
was vetoing that bill.

00:33:14.490 --> 00:33:19.010
So she, I believe, single handedly kept

00:33:19.010 --> 00:33:20.083
it from becoming law.

00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:24.340
But the credit industry
of course had not given up

00:33:24.340 --> 00:33:26.170
and Bush had moved to the White House.

00:33:26.170 --> 00:33:30.350
They now had a republican
controlled Senate, House,

00:33:30.350 --> 00:33:32.080
and White House.

00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:35.460
And Mrs. Clinton was now Senator Clinton.

00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:38.513
And the bankruptcy bill came up again.

00:33:40.150 --> 00:33:43.330
And this time Senator
Clinton voted in favor of it.

00:33:43.330 --> 00:33:45.790
It was the same basic bill

00:33:45.790 --> 00:33:47.763
as the one her husband had vetoed.

00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:51.150
But now as Senator Clinton--

00:33:51.150 --> 00:33:51.983
- [Harry] From New York.

00:33:51.983 --> 00:33:55.323
- From New York, where there
are strong banking interests.

00:33:57.290 --> 00:34:00.420
And who was very concerned
about raising money.

00:34:00.420 --> 00:34:02.280
And very concerned about what she saw

00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:04.193
as her business constituency.

00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:09.200
She took a different position
on the bankruptcy bill.

00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:14.200
And my own view of that
was less about anger

00:34:17.390 --> 00:34:21.010
and more about despair.

00:34:21.010 --> 00:34:25.740
Because if Hillary Clinton couldn't resist

00:34:25.740 --> 00:34:30.740
the pull, the demands of a well financed

00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:37.000
lobbying group like that then who would?

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:39.580
Would there be a single senator
or a single representative

00:34:39.580 --> 00:34:43.630
left to do the people's business?

00:34:43.630 --> 00:34:47.010
Now I should say when the
bill ultimately passed

00:34:47.010 --> 00:34:52.010
in 2005 she was not in the Senate that day

00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:54.830
but she issued a very
strong press release saying

00:34:54.830 --> 00:34:56.520
that she would oppose the bill

00:34:56.520 --> 00:34:57.830
and thought it was a bad idea.

00:34:57.830 --> 00:35:01.100
So perhaps as she developed

00:35:01.100 --> 00:35:03.290
a stronger position her view on it changed

00:35:03.290 --> 00:35:08.290
but it is a reminder of how
powerful money is in Washington.

00:35:10.410 --> 00:35:13.300
- And so what it then is,
is the political answer?

00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:15.020
Is it information?

00:35:15.020 --> 00:35:17.072
Is it organizing?

00:35:17.072 --> 00:35:20.930
Is it blogging, which you're now doing

00:35:20.930 --> 00:35:25.410
on Talking Points Memo Cafe, yes?

00:35:25.410 --> 00:35:29.310
- Well you know partly,
I'll back up a little bit

00:35:29.310 --> 00:35:30.250
for the answer.

00:35:30.250 --> 00:35:33.020
I believe now in guerrilla warfare.

00:35:33.020 --> 00:35:34.610
I'll go anywhere, I'll do anything

00:35:34.610 --> 00:35:35.760
to talk about these issues.

00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:37.040
And its a lot more than bankruptcy.

00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:38.883
Its about the economics of the family.

00:35:38.883 --> 00:35:40.470
Its every part of it.

00:35:40.470 --> 00:35:43.773
So part of the answer
absolutely is political.

00:35:44.630 --> 00:35:46.200
Part of it is about raising awareness.

00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:48.500
Part of it is why I
sit here with you today

00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:52.060
instead of spending this time,
you know back in Cambridge

00:35:52.060 --> 00:35:54.560
churning out one more
number that nobody looks at.

00:35:55.740 --> 00:35:57.750
That's part of it and part

00:35:57.750 --> 00:35:59.940
of it is the world is changing out there.

00:35:59.940 --> 00:36:04.360
You know, you can say
we don't have to worry

00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:06.210
about those folks who go bankrupt.

00:36:06.210 --> 00:36:08.020
Technical amendments, who cares.

00:36:08.020 --> 00:36:11.500
For awhile, but we reached a point

00:36:11.500 --> 00:36:15.430
in America a few years
ago where more people went

00:36:15.430 --> 00:36:17.840
through bankruptcy than
graduated from college

00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:18.923
in a single year.

00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:23.670
More people filed for bankruptcy
than had a heart attack.

00:36:23.670 --> 00:36:28.670
More children lived in homes
that were filing for bankruptcy

00:36:29.630 --> 00:36:31.933
than in homes that were
filing for divorce.

00:36:34.370 --> 00:36:37.000
And what that starts to tell you

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:40.960
is there's not anybody left
in America now, middle class

00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:43.640
America who doesn't, who
either hasn't gone bankrupt

00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:45.800
or doesn't have a brother or a cousin

00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:50.800
or teacher, or a sister, or
a dear friend who hasn't lost

00:36:52.300 --> 00:36:53.930
a job, who hasn't gotten sick.

00:36:53.930 --> 00:36:56.610
Who hasn't had to go through this process.

00:36:56.610 --> 00:36:59.420
We're on target now, just
to step beyond bankruptcy,

00:36:59.420 --> 00:37:04.110
we're on target now to see
1.4 million families thrown

00:37:04.110 --> 00:37:06.963
out of their houses this
year in mortgage foreclosure.

00:37:07.830 --> 00:37:11.950
One in every seven Americans right now

00:37:11.950 --> 00:37:14.870
is dealing with a debt collector.

00:37:14.870 --> 00:37:17.313
Has debts they can't pay.

00:37:19.610 --> 00:37:22.190
We can hear the word from Washington,

00:37:22.190 --> 00:37:25.470
oh it's all about personal
responsibility over

00:37:25.470 --> 00:37:27.610
and over and over but at some point

00:37:27.610 --> 00:37:32.540
the families themselves
start to say, uh-ah, no good.

00:37:32.540 --> 00:37:33.440
This answer doesn't work.

00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:36.190
Indeed, I should point out, some

00:37:36.190 --> 00:37:41.060
of the family oriented groups

00:37:41.060 --> 00:37:43.480
that have aligned themselves politically

00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:48.480
with conservatives,
they have backed off now

00:37:50.090 --> 00:37:53.730
and said on bankruptcy
issues, on credit card issues,

00:37:53.730 --> 00:37:57.923
on payday loan issues,
on home mortgage issues,

00:37:58.870 --> 00:38:00.460
Congress has gotta go a different way.

00:38:00.460 --> 00:38:03.670
Now have they yelled it
from the rooftops, no.

00:38:03.670 --> 00:38:05.863
But the cracks are starting to appear.

00:38:06.881 --> 00:38:11.881
- Lets go back and talk now
about this bigger picture

00:38:12.580 --> 00:38:15.980
of where the middle class finds itself.

00:38:15.980 --> 00:38:18.460
Both from your own personal experience,

00:38:18.460 --> 00:38:20.670
from what you were experiencing

00:38:20.670 --> 00:38:24.770
as a lawyer academic
studying these issues.

00:38:24.770 --> 00:38:27.030
What we're witnessing, beginning I guess

00:38:27.030 --> 00:38:31.460
in the 70s is a major economic transition

00:38:31.460 --> 00:38:34.620
in this country affecting the family

00:38:34.620 --> 00:38:36.380
and everybody's running to catch up.

00:38:36.380 --> 00:38:40.010
Talk a little about us,
give us that big picture.

00:38:40.010 --> 00:38:43.440
- So in the second half of 20th century

00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:47.010
the single most important
economic thing that happened

00:38:47.010 --> 00:38:50.660
is that millions of mother's
poured back into the workforce.

00:38:50.660 --> 00:38:55.660
And that's the only thing that
kept family income rising.

00:38:57.830 --> 00:39:01.440
Starting in about 1970 a
fully employed male's wages

00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:04.880
completely flattened out and in fact

00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:08.040
a fully employed male
today, on average, median

00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:12.250
earns about $800 less than his dad earned

00:39:12.250 --> 00:39:13.223
a generation ago.

00:39:14.190 --> 00:39:17.880
So the family, unlike the first 70 years

00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:20.090
of the 20th century where
productivity went up

00:39:20.090 --> 00:39:24.550
and wages went up, the
family, there becomes a split.

00:39:24.550 --> 00:39:27.860
Wages flatten for men and
the family does better only

00:39:27.860 --> 00:39:30.290
if they can put two
people in the workforce.

00:39:30.290 --> 00:39:34.370
And the norm switches
from a one earner family

00:39:34.370 --> 00:39:36.760
to a two earner family, becomes the median

00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:38.860
for those who are lucky enough to have it.

00:39:40.010 --> 00:39:42.640
And you'd think, now if
you thought well that's

00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:44.810
the only thing that's
happened, we should be richer.

00:39:44.810 --> 00:39:45.780
We should have more savings.

00:39:45.780 --> 00:39:47.960
We should have very little debt.

00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:52.960
But expenses in the same 30
year period far outstripped

00:39:55.140 --> 00:39:56.140
what the families are spending.

00:39:56.140 --> 00:39:59.540
And I'm not talking about
consumer price index.

00:39:59.540 --> 00:40:01.203
So here's the division.

00:40:02.570 --> 00:40:05.070
Families today, just I wanna compare

00:40:05.070 --> 00:40:06.840
a mom, dad, and two kids today

00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:09.400
with a mom, dad, and
two kids 30 years ago.

00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:12.563
When you started a
family in 1971, as I did.

00:40:14.820 --> 00:40:16.260
What happens on spending?

00:40:16.260 --> 00:40:18.230
Start with the consumption,
this is what everyone,

00:40:18.230 --> 00:40:20.970
this again the popular medium,
why are people in trouble?

00:40:20.970 --> 00:40:23.480
Too many Gameboys, too many iPods.

00:40:23.480 --> 00:40:25.970
Too many $200 sneakers.

00:40:25.970 --> 00:40:30.017
In fact families today, adjusted
for inflation, spend less

00:40:31.100 --> 00:40:36.100
on clothing, less on food
including eating out.

00:40:37.190 --> 00:40:40.200
Less on furniture, less on appliances

00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:43.090
than they spent a generation ago.

00:40:43.090 --> 00:40:48.090
Where they spend more is for
three bedroom one bath house.

00:40:48.350 --> 00:40:53.350
The median family is
spending about 80% more

00:40:53.380 --> 00:40:55.830
on mortgage payments,
adjusted for inflation,

00:40:55.830 --> 00:40:57.240
than they spent a generation ago.

00:40:57.240 --> 00:41:00.570
They're spending about 75%
more for health insurance

00:41:00.570 --> 00:41:02.930
than they spent a generation ago.

00:41:02.930 --> 00:41:05.170
Because today they need two cars instead

00:41:05.170 --> 00:41:09.490
of one they're spending
about 60% more on cars.

00:41:09.490 --> 00:41:11.390
They're paying for
childcare, which of course

00:41:11.390 --> 00:41:13.160
they didn't do a generation ago.

00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:14.010
- [Harry] Because the mother was home.

00:41:14.010 --> 00:41:17.670
- Because the mother was
home and they are paying more

00:41:17.670 --> 00:41:21.090
for taxes because progressive
taxation, when you've

00:41:21.090 --> 00:41:23.400
got two incomes that
second one is being taxed

00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:27.380
at a higher rate than if they
were being taxed separately.

00:41:27.380 --> 00:41:29.300
So a generation ago, let me see

00:41:29.300 --> 00:41:31.510
if I can do this as a picture.

00:41:31.510 --> 00:41:34.200
The median American family
in the United States

00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:36.170
spent about half of its income

00:41:36.170 --> 00:41:38.790
on those basic fixed expenses.

00:41:38.790 --> 00:41:42.310
The mortgage, health insurance,
transportation, taxes,

00:41:42.310 --> 00:41:43.573
nothing on childcare.

00:41:44.620 --> 00:41:49.620
Today the median two income
family is spending 75%

00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:55.500
of their income on those
five basic expenses

00:41:56.420 --> 00:41:59.610
and with two people in the
workforce they actually

00:41:59.610 --> 00:42:04.370
have fewer dollars left over
than their one income parents

00:42:04.370 --> 00:42:07.470
had a generation ago to cover everything.

00:42:07.470 --> 00:42:09.710
To cover all of the flexible things.

00:42:09.710 --> 00:42:13.750
Food, and clothing, and
savings, and vacations,

00:42:13.750 --> 00:42:16.720
and all the other kinds
of expenses that come up.

00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:21.720
So what we have today
is we have two people

00:42:21.930 --> 00:42:25.610
working full time, flat out, hard bore

00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:30.140
and they actually have less money to spend

00:42:30.140 --> 00:42:34.913
than one person working full
time just one generation ago.

00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:39.120
- And the old system had a built in backup

00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:43.060
and this system does not because
both are already working.

00:42:43.060 --> 00:42:48.060
Talk a little about that because
this is a very vulnerable

00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:52.610
family that we have today
because of the job market,

00:42:52.610 --> 00:42:55.030
healthcare, illness, and so on.

00:42:55.030 --> 00:42:58.280
- So what's happened is
not only has the picture

00:42:58.280 --> 00:43:01.630
changed on the family
budget but now take a look

00:43:01.630 --> 00:43:02.500
at the risk side.

00:43:02.500 --> 00:43:07.500
A generation ago if dad got
sick, or got laid off, mom

00:43:09.670 --> 00:43:11.870
and that's who it usually
was, didn't just sit home

00:43:11.870 --> 00:43:14.200
and wring her hands, she went to work.

00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:15.970
And yeah she didn't make as much money

00:43:15.970 --> 00:43:18.100
as mom's make today when they go to work.

00:43:18.100 --> 00:43:19.180
She didn't have as much experience

00:43:19.180 --> 00:43:21.960
but every dollar she
made was a new dollar.

00:43:21.960 --> 00:43:24.500
A dollar that had not been
built into the family budget.

00:43:24.500 --> 00:43:27.330
So between unemployment insurance

00:43:27.330 --> 00:43:30.360
and the new dollars
that mom could bring in,

00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:32.980
they could survive a
period of unemployment.

00:43:32.980 --> 00:43:34.240
A period of illness.

00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:35.720
They had a little extra something.

00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:37.670
A child who had extra expenses.

00:43:37.670 --> 00:43:41.090
Mom go to work, you could
add a little extra on.

00:43:41.090 --> 00:43:43.760
Today's family is already full out.

00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:46.050
They've got both people in
the work force full time

00:43:46.050 --> 00:43:48.510
and in fact, think about it for a second,

00:43:48.510 --> 00:43:50.510
it creates its own vulnerabilities.

00:43:50.510 --> 00:43:54.530
So today a family, instead of having

00:43:54.530 --> 00:43:58.000
to have 52 paychecks to be able to make

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:00.480
the mortgage payment and
keep the health insurance.

00:44:00.480 --> 00:44:02.830
Remember that budget, they're spending 75%

00:44:02.830 --> 00:44:06.040
just to make the nut, that
means they gotta bring home

00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:10.710
104 paychecks, and that
means they have double

00:44:10.710 --> 00:44:12.570
the risk someone will get laid off.

00:44:12.570 --> 00:44:14.520
Double the risk somebody will get too sick

00:44:14.520 --> 00:44:17.770
to go to work and here's
the new one that's come in.

00:44:17.770 --> 00:44:21.160
Today if a child gets
sick or if grandma falls

00:44:21.160 --> 00:44:25.060
and breaks a hip someone's
gotta take off work

00:44:25.060 --> 00:44:26.220
to be with them.

00:44:26.220 --> 00:44:28.340
A generation ago you already had someone

00:44:28.340 --> 00:44:30.400
at home to be able to
fill that other role.

00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:32.890
So it could be bad if a child got sick

00:44:32.890 --> 00:44:35.190
but it didn't have an income effect.

00:44:35.190 --> 00:44:38.850
Mom was home, mom could
take care of a sick child.

00:44:38.850 --> 00:44:42.260
Today, someone's gotta
take off and for most jobs

00:44:42.260 --> 00:44:44.090
that means they lose income.

00:44:44.090 --> 00:44:48.750
So Jacob Hacker's work
in The Great Risk Shift,

00:44:48.750 --> 00:44:52.220
what Jacob shows is over
this same 30 year period

00:44:52.220 --> 00:44:56.230
that I'm looking at, what's
called income volatility,

00:44:56.230 --> 00:44:59.300
the odds that you will see a 20% drop

00:44:59.300 --> 00:45:01.780
in your family income
which is pretty strong

00:45:01.780 --> 00:45:03.890
if you've already committed
75% of your income

00:45:03.890 --> 00:45:07.300
on these expenses, has just climbed over

00:45:07.300 --> 00:45:08.750
this same 30 year period.

00:45:08.750 --> 00:45:12.860
So people, put it all together,
its like a pressure cooker.

00:45:12.860 --> 00:45:15.600
People are more likely to lose jobs

00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:16.780
than they were before.

00:45:16.780 --> 00:45:18.150
- And the jobs are going abroad.

00:45:18.150 --> 00:45:19.610
- The jobs are going abroad.

00:45:19.610 --> 00:45:23.160
When they lose jobs, just statistically,

00:45:23.160 --> 00:45:25.160
the odds that they'll get back a job

00:45:25.160 --> 00:45:27.810
that pays as well as the job they lost

00:45:27.810 --> 00:45:30.703
has gone down compared
with a generation ago.

00:45:31.730 --> 00:45:35.443
They run the risk that if
someone in the family gets

00:45:35.443 --> 00:45:38.960
sick that they're going to lose income.

00:45:38.960 --> 00:45:41.340
These are families that are losing

00:45:41.340 --> 00:45:44.823
health insurance, losing retirement.

00:45:45.820 --> 00:45:48.630
So what we're really watching here

00:45:48.630 --> 00:45:51.590
is a family unit that's getting more

00:45:51.590 --> 00:45:54.623
and more economically vulnerable.

00:45:55.670 --> 00:45:57.010
They're working harder than ever.

00:45:57.010 --> 00:45:58.650
They've got two people in the workforce.

00:45:58.650 --> 00:46:01.090
They're trying to do you
know, homework at night

00:46:01.090 --> 00:46:03.983
with the kids and hold it all together.

00:46:04.965 --> 00:46:08.330
And yet economically
every part of the game

00:46:08.330 --> 00:46:09.523
is loaded against them.

00:46:10.650 --> 00:46:13.430
- And you point out in this book

00:46:13.430 --> 00:46:18.430
and in your writings that
little pieces of this story,

00:46:18.470 --> 00:46:21.240
for example the focus on the family,

00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:24.500
the concern about education
of one's children,

00:46:24.500 --> 00:46:26.720
the need to get in the right neighborhood

00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:28.090
to get the right school.

00:46:28.090 --> 00:46:31.530
The commitment to a mortgage
that puts you even more

00:46:31.530 --> 00:46:36.530
on the edge, these things sort of impact

00:46:36.780 --> 00:46:41.680
this very vulnerable situation
even to a greater extent

00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:44.870
over time and its all
about, I want my kids

00:46:44.870 --> 00:46:46.250
to have the best education.

00:46:46.250 --> 00:46:48.300
- I want my kids to have a shot at making

00:46:48.300 --> 00:46:50.117
it in the middle class.

00:46:50.117 --> 00:46:52.000
This is what it's about for parents.

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:55.840
And so what does that
mean in America today.

00:46:55.840 --> 00:46:59.480
Because of our peculiar way
of financing higher education.

00:46:59.480 --> 00:47:02.510
It means you gotta get
to the right zip code.

00:47:02.510 --> 00:47:04.500
'Cause the right zip code will determine

00:47:04.500 --> 00:47:06.340
the school assignment for your child.

00:47:06.340 --> 00:47:10.450
And what's happened is prices have shifted

00:47:10.450 --> 00:47:12.210
on those zip codes.

00:47:12.210 --> 00:47:15.680
So here's one, now this
one the government doesn't

00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:17.490
have data going back quite so far,

00:47:17.490 --> 00:47:18.750
so the numbers are a little bit off.

00:47:18.750 --> 00:47:21.163
But starting in 1983 they've got data.

00:47:22.290 --> 00:47:26.850
When you compare the rise in housing costs

00:47:26.850 --> 00:47:29.900
for families with no children,
households with no children.

00:47:29.900 --> 00:47:32.000
Singles, anyone who doesn't have children

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:34.071
at home, minor children.

00:47:34.071 --> 00:47:36.123
And households that have minor children.

00:47:37.010 --> 00:47:42.000
Households without children,
from 1983 to 2005 saw

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:44.940
a 50% increase in what it costs

00:47:44.940 --> 00:47:48.140
to buy the same, their housing,

00:47:48.140 --> 00:47:49.593
their three bedroom one bath.

00:47:51.140 --> 00:47:55.720
Families with children,
saw a 100% increase

00:47:55.720 --> 00:47:57.500
in that same time period.

00:47:57.500 --> 00:47:59.920
Why, not because they're all desperate.

00:47:59.920 --> 00:48:01.730
Families with children have a bigger need

00:48:01.730 --> 00:48:05.010
for granite counter tops or spa bathrooms

00:48:05.890 --> 00:48:09.460
but because housing is the substitute way

00:48:09.460 --> 00:48:12.263
to buy your way into a
decent school system.

00:48:13.210 --> 00:48:16.240
We pull out the studies in this that show

00:48:16.240 --> 00:48:21.240
that housing prices
will reflect things like

00:48:21.570 --> 00:48:26.570
a five point difference in
third grade reading scores.

00:48:26.810 --> 00:48:29.960
Will translate into thousands of dollars

00:48:29.960 --> 00:48:32.760
of difference in the price
of houses in neighborhoods

00:48:32.760 --> 00:48:35.310
that are otherwise matched
for all their amenities

00:48:35.310 --> 00:48:40.310
and sidewalks, and police
service, and everything else.

00:48:40.660 --> 00:48:45.350
And I wanna be clear here,
this is white families,

00:48:45.350 --> 00:48:49.000
African American families,
Hispanic families,

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:53.630
Asian families, its across every spectrum.

00:48:53.630 --> 00:48:56.660
Families with children
are tightening the belt

00:48:56.660 --> 00:48:57.870
one more notch.

00:48:57.870 --> 00:49:01.280
Are working extra hours,
are sending both people

00:49:01.280 --> 00:49:04.220
into the workforce to try to get

00:49:04.220 --> 00:49:06.850
in to the best possible
school district they can

00:49:06.850 --> 00:49:08.133
get their children into.

00:49:09.880 --> 00:49:12.660
Families are in financial trouble not

00:49:12.660 --> 00:49:14.760
because they're irresponsible

00:49:14.760 --> 00:49:16.593
but because they're too responsible.

00:49:17.690 --> 00:49:19.540
They're trying to do it for the kids.

00:49:20.520 --> 00:49:23.540
- Now you know, all the literature

00:49:23.540 --> 00:49:28.540
and comparative politics
writing about democracy.

00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:33.900
Democratization, I think
they point to the importance

00:49:33.900 --> 00:49:38.900
of the middle class as the foundation

00:49:39.010 --> 00:49:42.003
of a working, democratic system.

00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:46.160
What are the long term
implications of what you're saying?

00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:48.094
I mean obviously bankruptcy is one

00:49:48.094 --> 00:49:52.200
but it would seem to suggest that just

00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:55.780
as in foreign policy and
domestic policy, our system

00:49:55.780 --> 00:49:59.070
is not working very well, if at all

00:49:59.070 --> 00:50:02.290
and it has long term
consequences for what we're gonna

00:50:02.290 --> 00:50:03.210
be in the future.

00:50:03.210 --> 00:50:07.170
- Absolutely, a strong
middle class is what gives us

00:50:07.170 --> 00:50:08.170
a strong democracy.

00:50:08.170 --> 00:50:09.780
Its what gives us a strong economy.

00:50:09.780 --> 00:50:12.290
Its what makes us flexible and
able to compete in the world.

00:50:12.290 --> 00:50:14.733
Its what makes us who we are.

00:50:16.910 --> 00:50:18.880
Here's what I fear, here's what I think

00:50:18.880 --> 00:50:21.550
these data point toward.

00:50:21.550 --> 00:50:25.390
I think they point toward
a larger upper class.

00:50:25.390 --> 00:50:27.060
I don't wanna take away from that.

00:50:27.060 --> 00:50:29.280
There are more people who are doing well.

00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:31.170
And I'm not just talking about
at the billionaire level.

00:50:31.170 --> 00:50:35.610
I'm talking about at the
150000, $200000 level.

00:50:35.610 --> 00:50:37.170
Its a bigger group.

00:50:37.170 --> 00:50:40.060
If you don't get sick, if
you don't lose your job,

00:50:40.060 --> 00:50:41.590
if you don't divorce, if you don't have

00:50:41.590 --> 00:50:42.630
a death in the family.

00:50:42.630 --> 00:50:46.870
If none of the stumbles
hit you and you've got

00:50:46.870 --> 00:50:50.920
a good job and you hang
onto it for 40 years you've

00:50:50.920 --> 00:50:54.470
got a good chance to
be in a new upper class

00:50:54.470 --> 00:50:55.873
that is larger.

00:50:57.870 --> 00:51:01.573
But the rest is just one big underclass.

00:51:02.740 --> 00:51:06.870
Its families that are
living paycheck to paycheck.

00:51:06.870 --> 00:51:09.760
Who are dealing, this
week with debt collectors

00:51:09.760 --> 00:51:13.910
and next with late fees and 29% interest

00:51:13.910 --> 00:51:18.490
on the credit card who
are on a kind of treadmill

00:51:18.490 --> 00:51:20.960
that they can never get out of debt, never

00:51:20.960 --> 00:51:23.710
put anything aside in the way of savings.

00:51:23.710 --> 00:51:27.093
They have sort of better
moments and worse moments.

00:51:28.020 --> 00:51:31.230
But its no longer the
differentiation between

00:51:31.230 --> 00:51:33.113
the poor and the middle.

00:51:34.020 --> 00:51:37.770
Its between the upper and everybody else.

00:51:37.770 --> 00:51:42.090
Because everybody else
lives on a financial cliff

00:51:42.090 --> 00:51:44.030
and some are getting pushed off.

00:51:44.030 --> 00:51:46.530
Some are just gonna hang
on the edge of the cliff.

00:51:47.870 --> 00:51:52.660
I fear we are moving
toward a two tier society

00:51:52.660 --> 00:51:56.580
and that government
policies have pushed us

00:51:56.580 --> 00:52:00.160
in that direction, have
encouraged that division.

00:52:00.160 --> 00:52:02.830
Have made it more comfortable for those

00:52:02.830 --> 00:52:06.960
in that larger group of well to do

00:52:06.960 --> 00:52:10.690
and much more dangerous for those who are

00:52:10.690 --> 00:52:13.600
the big underclass in America.

00:52:13.600 --> 00:52:16.860
- If one were to address
this as a political problem

00:52:17.890 --> 00:52:22.400
I hear in our conversation two elements

00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:24.350
that strike me as rather important

00:52:24.350 --> 00:52:28.450
if one is gonna change the
political configuration.

00:52:28.450 --> 00:52:30.860
One we've talked about the religion,

00:52:30.860 --> 00:52:35.860
which is articulating a
set of ideas about virtue

00:52:38.810 --> 00:52:41.640
and goodness and so on that
don't address the problem

00:52:41.640 --> 00:52:44.390
at all as you pointed out.

00:52:44.390 --> 00:52:47.350
But then the other is America's role

00:52:47.350 --> 00:52:51.370
in the global economy where
in fact what we're doing

00:52:51.370 --> 00:52:53.500
is spending ourselves into debt

00:52:53.500 --> 00:52:57.120
and that to make it appear that we

00:52:57.120 --> 00:52:58.530
are doing economically better

00:52:58.530 --> 00:53:00.710
than we have we're
essentially giving people

00:53:00.710 --> 00:53:02.470
as much money as they want.

00:53:02.470 --> 00:53:04.710
You know, at adjustable rate mortgages

00:53:04.710 --> 00:53:07.980
which we will now discover
may create problems.

00:53:07.980 --> 00:53:10.460
But in fact the Japanese and the Chinese

00:53:10.460 --> 00:53:14.940
are willing to finance this so long

00:53:14.940 --> 00:53:16.865
as we continue to buy their products.

00:53:16.865 --> 00:53:21.865
So these are two very
powerful configurations,

00:53:22.300 --> 00:53:23.500
political configurations.

00:53:23.500 --> 00:53:25.100
What we're doing internationally

00:53:25.100 --> 00:53:28.110
and what, the way we're
presenting a narrative

00:53:28.110 --> 00:53:30.990
at home that strike me
as quite formidable.

00:53:30.990 --> 00:53:33.390
And that only collapse will change things.

00:53:33.390 --> 00:53:36.615
- You know, and I wanna add to it.

00:53:36.615 --> 00:53:40.290
I'll tell you both my hope and my fear

00:53:40.290 --> 00:53:42.520
as I draw these together.

00:53:42.520 --> 00:53:46.440
I put my nickel on education
if Americans are going

00:53:46.440 --> 00:53:50.820
to remain competitive,
that's our only shot.

00:53:50.820 --> 00:53:53.750
We can't afford to waste a
single young person in America.

00:53:53.750 --> 00:53:55.730
We need to get as many
of them as well educated

00:53:55.730 --> 00:53:58.083
as we can and that means
on through college.

00:53:59.160 --> 00:54:02.883
And that has become the
new secular religion.

00:54:04.240 --> 00:54:08.150
Twice as many people believe
that the moon shot landing

00:54:08.150 --> 00:54:10.890
was faked than believe you can make

00:54:10.890 --> 00:54:13.790
it in America without a college diploma.

00:54:13.790 --> 00:54:18.790
So we have this huge appetite for that's

00:54:18.810 --> 00:54:21.200
the final thrust to get my children

00:54:21.200 --> 00:54:23.800
a chance to be in the
middle class, college.

00:54:23.800 --> 00:54:27.050
And yet what's happening with college?

00:54:27.050 --> 00:54:28.823
We don't pay for it collectively.

00:54:29.740 --> 00:54:33.440
We make families pay for it individually

00:54:33.440 --> 00:54:38.080
and we make the students load up on debt

00:54:38.080 --> 00:54:43.080
so that the next generation's
huge division here

00:54:43.910 --> 00:54:47.490
is that the children of
well to do families who

00:54:47.490 --> 00:54:49.510
can afford to pay for
the college education

00:54:49.510 --> 00:54:51.977
for their children, they have a leg up.

00:54:51.977 --> 00:54:54.670
They start their adult
lives, if nothing else

00:54:54.670 --> 00:54:56.880
at least dead flat broke, right.

00:54:56.880 --> 00:54:57.963
At least at even.

00:54:59.410 --> 00:55:04.410
The children of that huge underclass start

00:55:05.130 --> 00:55:08.250
with tens, sometimes hundreds of thousands

00:55:08.250 --> 00:55:10.620
of dollars in debt.

00:55:10.620 --> 00:55:13.030
And for some it'll be a good investment

00:55:13.030 --> 00:55:17.548
and for some it will be the
rock that will sink them.

00:55:17.548 --> 00:55:22.510
They start the great
American race 50 yards behind

00:55:22.510 --> 00:55:24.700
the starting line, much
less the finish line.

00:55:24.700 --> 00:55:26.420
They've got all this debt
that they've gotta manage

00:55:26.420 --> 00:55:28.380
and all this debt they've gotta pay off.

00:55:28.380 --> 00:55:31.170
And we've written laws to make it

00:55:31.170 --> 00:55:32.810
that these debts are none dischargeable.

00:55:32.810 --> 00:55:34.380
You can't get out of these debts.

00:55:34.380 --> 00:55:36.660
If you get sick you still
have to pay these debts.

00:55:36.660 --> 00:55:38.000
If you don't have a job you still have

00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:40.483
to pay these debts, really tough.

00:55:41.470 --> 00:55:45.900
And so we put this in a global context.

00:55:45.900 --> 00:55:50.900
We need an educated America
to help us compete around

00:55:52.720 --> 00:55:56.600
the world to make good jobs, to make there

00:55:56.600 --> 00:55:59.323
be a reason to have good
jobs here in America.

00:56:00.170 --> 00:56:05.170
And what I fear is that we not
only have mortgaged our homes

00:56:05.390 --> 00:56:09.160
have mortgaged our incomes
going forward between

00:56:09.160 --> 00:56:11.310
the subprime mortgages
and the credit card debt

00:56:11.310 --> 00:56:14.660
and the payday loans, but that

00:56:14.660 --> 00:56:18.083
the way we're financing
college educations right now,

00:56:19.170 --> 00:56:23.220
we are mortgaging our
very future in this world.

00:56:23.220 --> 00:56:27.963
And that the America that
I knew, that I grew up in,

00:56:29.970 --> 00:56:32.280
will be something that will be confined

00:56:32.280 --> 00:56:33.900
to the history books.

00:56:33.900 --> 00:56:36.480
But it won't be there
for my grandchildren.

00:56:36.480 --> 00:56:40.750
- One last question, we
have not much time left

00:56:40.750 --> 00:56:45.160
so a brief answer, what can
people do about all of this?

00:56:45.160 --> 00:56:48.960
The audience out there watching,
should they become part

00:56:48.960 --> 00:56:52.100
of consumer groups, should
they get involved in campaigns?

00:56:52.100 --> 00:56:54.326
What do you advise them to help change--

00:56:54.326 --> 00:56:57.200
- Yes, that's part of it.

00:56:57.200 --> 00:57:01.490
Part of it is, they need
to do it, its the you know,

00:57:01.490 --> 00:57:03.640
think globally and act locally.

00:57:03.640 --> 00:57:06.630
Partly they need to do it
with their own spending.

00:57:06.630 --> 00:57:08.640
I ended up writing a book
we didn't talk about today

00:57:08.640 --> 00:57:11.590
and that's fine, but that I'd
never thought I would write.

00:57:11.590 --> 00:57:14.740
All Your Worth, that talks
directly to families about how

00:57:14.740 --> 00:57:16.880
to budget, how to get outta debt.

00:57:16.880 --> 00:57:21.880
How to get out from underneath
this giant credit machine

00:57:23.380 --> 00:57:26.360
that wants to eat families alive.

00:57:26.360 --> 00:57:31.100
So it is, its partly about politics.

00:57:31.100 --> 00:57:35.650
If you don't email your
congresswoman or congressman

00:57:35.650 --> 00:57:38.770
and your senator then you
are part of the problem

00:57:38.770 --> 00:57:39.603
today in my view.

00:57:39.603 --> 00:57:41.780
You've gotta tell 'em this is
an issue that matters to you.

00:57:41.780 --> 00:57:44.600
This really truly matters.

00:57:44.600 --> 00:57:46.530
We may finally do something
about global warming

00:57:46.530 --> 00:57:49.050
because enough people said
this one matters to me.

00:57:49.050 --> 00:57:50.740
The same thing has gotta be true about

00:57:50.740 --> 00:57:52.890
the economics of the middle class.

00:57:52.890 --> 00:57:55.210
About debt, about credit card companies,

00:57:55.210 --> 00:57:57.490
and mortgage lenders who
are writing all the rules

00:57:57.490 --> 00:57:58.940
and running the show.

00:57:58.940 --> 00:58:02.070
So yes, you've got to let people

00:58:02.070 --> 00:58:05.460
in government know that
this matters to you

00:58:05.460 --> 00:58:08.620
and you've gotta do what
you can to stay away

00:58:08.620 --> 00:58:10.300
from these vultures.

00:58:10.300 --> 00:58:14.080
- Professor Warren on that
note, I wanna show your book

00:58:14.080 --> 00:58:15.930
one more time, one of your books

00:58:15.930 --> 00:58:20.840
for the general public,
The Two-Income Trap.

00:58:20.840 --> 00:58:22.920
And the other one is called, I forgot,

00:58:22.920 --> 00:58:24.140
what is your other one called?

00:58:24.140 --> 00:58:25.000
- All Your Worth.

00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:26.740
- All Your Worth, which is a manual

00:58:26.740 --> 00:58:29.720
for managing your own
finances in this country.

00:58:29.720 --> 00:58:31.870
But thank you very much
for being on our program

00:58:31.870 --> 00:58:33.570
and for doing all this good work.

00:58:33.570 --> 00:58:35.240
- Its a pleasure to be here, thank you.

00:58:35.240 --> 00:58:37.030
- Thank you, and thank you very much

00:58:37.030 --> 00:58:40.349
for joining us for this
Conversation with History.

00:58:40.349 --> 00:58:42.932
