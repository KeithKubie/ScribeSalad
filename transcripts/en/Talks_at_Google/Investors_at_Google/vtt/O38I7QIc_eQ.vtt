00:00:05.892 --> 00:00:10.311
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:12.457 --> 00:00:13.790
SAURABH MADAAN: Hello, everyone.

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:17.420
I'm Saurabh Madaan, and welcome
to another of our special value

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:18.800
investing talks.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.750
We have a very, very
special guest today with us.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.650
He is an investor
par excellence.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.260
He searches for
long-term compounders.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.180
But just speaking with him
before this talk began,

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.430
I can also tell you that he
has a great sense of humor.

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.020
So I hope we get to
see that in action

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.310
live, as he asks you questions
and you ask him questions.

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.570
So I'm going to do a very,
very brief introduction.

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.820
Charles T. Akre, also
known as Chuck Akre

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.120
is an American investor,
financier, and businessman.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.180
He serves on the board of
directors of the Enstar Group.

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.210
He's also the founder,
chairman, and CIO

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:04.160
of Akre Capital Management,
FBR Focus, and other funds.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:09.170
Akre Capital Management is
based in Middleburg, Virginia.

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:14.900
So without any further
ado, over to Chuck Akre.

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.950
CHUCK AKRE: Thank you, Saurabh.

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.310
Great.

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.630
So I just want to
clarify one thing.

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.880
I've not been associated
with FBR Focus

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.740
Fund since August of 2009.

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.820
And that was a fund
that I ran previously,

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:40.260
and before we started our own
fund in September of 2009.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:45.580
I just wrote down some notes,
and the headline in the notes

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.640
said, The Peregrinations of
an English Major in Search

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:50.720
of the Investment Puzzle.

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.810
And Saurabh said that
he was interested

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.990
and the group would be
interested in the whole way

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.750
I got involved in this
and how it's evolved.

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.920
And I started out as what
I call a know-nothing.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.210
I was a pre-med student
and then an English major.

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:17.190
And so I had not had a single
business course of any variety

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:23.230
when I started as a
stockbroker in July of 1968.

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.320
So your quick math can tell
you how long I've been at this.

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:28.080
Awhile.

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.850
In Virginia, they
say, since dirt.

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:38.280
And so I had, in effect,
really, a clean canvas,

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.440
as to where I should go
and what I should do.

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:46.800
And so, since I knew nothing,
my goal was to figure this out.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.320
And the investment
puzzle started out

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.900
with what makes a
good investor and what

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.220
makes a good investment?

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.940
And I read voraciously
and still do.

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.790
And in the early
works that I read

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.417
that were very important to me
were books like John Train's

00:03:04.417 --> 00:03:05.250
"The Money Masters."

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.970
It was the first written
story about Warren Buffett,

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.880
other than a Forbes magazine
article and that sort of stuff

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:19.230
And actually, in that, Buffett
outlines the only place

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.110
that I've ever seen it.

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.160
He gives the characteristics
of a great business

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.290
and the characteristics of
what makes a great investor.

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.520
And that was a very
important book to me.

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.640
I've read things like the
"Intelligent Investor,"

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.800
Ben Graham wrote.

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.050
In 1972, I came
across a book that

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:41.520
was reviewed in "Barron's"
called "100 to 1

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.600
in the Stock Market," and it was
written by a Boston investment

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:46.100
manager.

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:47.475
His name was Thomas Phelps.

00:03:47.475 --> 00:03:50.010
SAURABH MADAAN: Phelps.

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.440
CHUCK AKRE: And what
was interesting to me

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.940
was that it really made
me come around and focus

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.070
on the idea of compound return.

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:03.780
He never actually explicitly
talks about compound return,

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:08.580
but he identified roughly 350
businesses, public companies,

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:12.900
that you could have invested in,
beginning in the mid-'30s, all

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.190
the way up to '71, and
made 100 times your money.

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:17.940
And in fact, there
were a couple instances

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.740
where you'd have made 100 times
your money in just two or three

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:21.240
years.

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:23.311
A really quite
extraordinary thing.

00:04:23.311 --> 00:04:25.060
The difference in all
of those, of course,

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.540
has to do with the rate at
which you compound your capital.

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:31.150
And so that helped
me down that line.

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:35.160
And I also read, then and still
do, lots of business biography,

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.850
because it informs me
about human behavior.

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:42.030
How people behave in their
business life and business

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:45.970
world, and how that affects
what they're able to do.

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:48.990
So as I said at the
beginning, the puzzle was,

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:55.890
what makes a great investor,
and how do you identify this?

00:04:55.890 --> 00:05:00.810
How do you identify
a great investment,

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:03.270
if, for example, you
have a private company?

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:06.420
You can't just say, well, the
price of the stock went up.

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:10.200
If it's private, there's no
public share price disclosure.

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.089
So you know, the
simple way to describe

00:05:12.089 --> 00:05:14.130
it is if the pile of money
at the end of the year

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:15.963
is bigger than at the
beginning of the year,

00:05:15.963 --> 00:05:18.000
you know it's been successful.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:24.390
But if you had a business that
had so much opportunity to grow

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:26.430
that you invested
all the free cash,

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:29.013
and so you didn't have a pile
of money at the end of the year,

00:05:29.013 --> 00:05:31.125
you invested it in
initiatives to grow,

00:05:31.125 --> 00:05:33.687
you have to go to your
accountant, or your bookkeeper,

00:05:33.687 --> 00:05:35.520
or go to your CFO, or
whatever, and he says,

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:38.290
well, this is what your value
was at the end of last year,

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:40.920
and this is what your value
is at the end of this year.

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:43.270
And that's how you know if
a business is successful.

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:44.790
And it's a really
important idea,

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:47.820
because it just brings you back
to the simple issue of rate

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:49.050
of return.

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:52.200
And so, not only how much has
it gone up, but on an annualized

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:55.540
basis, and then you have
things you can compare it to.

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:02.249
So in that issue
about investors,

00:06:02.249 --> 00:06:04.290
what makes a great investor,
or one of the things

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:07.320
you ask yourself, do
you take undue risks?

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:09.420
How do you define the risks?

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:10.622
How do you tell?

00:06:10.622 --> 00:06:12.413
Have you lost a
significant amount of money

00:06:12.413 --> 00:06:13.680
in an investment.

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:15.270
Why do you think
you've done that?

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:20.950
All of these are important as we
develop our skill as investors.

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:26.220
And as I said, I had the
advantage of a clean canvas.

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:29.840
That is, I knew nothing when
I came into the business.

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:32.730
And I worked for a firm
that, when I joined it

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:36.270
in July of 1968, was
the most important

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:39.090
financial intermediary
in Washington, DC.

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:40.730
It had financed Geico.

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:42.030
It had financed Marriott.

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:44.520
It financed all
the other companies

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:46.680
that were public in
the Washington area.

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:49.034
And the world was
changing rapidly,

00:06:49.034 --> 00:06:51.450
as it related to the investment
business and the brokerage

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:54.540
business in the late
'60s and early '70s.

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:56.760
And this firm
wasn't particularly

00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:00.480
well-suited to deal with that,
but they were financially very

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:00.990
strong.

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:03.180
And it gave me an
opportunity, as I

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:06.390
say, to follow my own
nose in that business.

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:08.470
And that's how it
all comes about.

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:10.560
So when we get to
the piece about,

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:12.660
well, what makes a
great investment,

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:15.750
I go back to the issue
of rate of return.

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:18.780
Sometimes, a great investment
might be simply described

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:20.870
as, well, it met my goal.

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:22.590
That doesn't tell you anything.

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:26.190
Rate of return, we
say in our firm,

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:29.770
is the bottom line
of all investing,

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:33.280
and that's a really important
thing to think about.

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:41.700
And so Saurabh and I were
talking before this chat

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:47.080
today about businesses
that compound at 8% or 9%.

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:50.610
And I said, you know, 8% or
9%, when you compare it to a 1

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:54.150
and 1/2% interest rate on the
10-year is pretty attractive.

00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:57.930
And everything's relative,
but I think rate of return

00:07:57.930 --> 00:08:00.660
is hugely important.

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:04.500
And so then I went
to discover what

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:07.830
the historical rates of return
were in all different asset

00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:12.030
categories-- stocks, bonds,
art, real estate, oil

00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:16.570
and gas, collectibles,
fancy cars, you name it.

00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:19.600
And when I was looking at this
over, maybe, 70 years now,

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:22.350
or a 100 years, or
something like that,

00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:28.680
the data indicates that public
companies in the United States

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:33.690
have compounded at roughly
between 9% and 10% a year.

00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:36.830
And that's better than all
other asset categories,

00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:39.360
and it's unleveraged.

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:44.700
And so that causes me
to ask another question,

00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:48.030
and that other question
is, well, why is that so?

00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:51.390
Why isn't it 3% or
why isn't it 16%?

00:08:51.390 --> 00:08:56.820
And I'm not terribly
mathematically inclined,

00:08:56.820 --> 00:09:00.480
and so I use the term
that it correlates,

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:03.090
but I don't do that with
a mathematical background.

00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:09.720
I'm just saying I observe that
that 9%, 10%, not too precise,

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:13.650
is it approximates what
these companies are earning

00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:15.050
on the shareholders' capital.

00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:18.525
That is, we refer
to it simply as ROE.

00:09:18.525 --> 00:09:21.090
We look a little
bit more in depth,

00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:23.820
we're talking about
free cash flow return,

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:25.594
you know, subtracting
maintenance, CAPEX,

00:09:25.594 --> 00:09:27.510
and that sort of stuff
on the owner's capital,

00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:29.640
the capital employed.

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:35.940
And so I go from there
to posit the following.

00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:41.430
Our return in an asset
will approximate the ROE

00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:46.410
over a period of years,
given constant valuation

00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:51.010
and given the absence
of any distributions.

00:09:51.010 --> 00:09:53.820
So you all look up at me
and you say, well, you fool.

00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:56.700
Everybody knows you don't have a
constant valuation in the stock

00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:58.000
market.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.640
So we just work very hard to
have an attractive valuation

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:03.250
at the start.

00:10:03.250 --> 00:10:06.600
And you know, as it relates
to compounding your capital,

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:09.480
your opportunity for a
higher rate of compounding

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:11.880
is enhanced by a lower
valuation at the start.

00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:14.810
I mean, it's just real simple.

00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:18.990
And I have a little bit of
an arithmetic proof of that,

00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:20.820
if you're interested.

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:26.010
You take a $10 stock with a $5
book and $1 worth of earnings.

00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:29.220
So it's 10 times earnings,
it's 2 times book,

00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:31.830
and it's at 20% ROE.

00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:35.640
And you apply that
to the company

00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:37.410
and see what happens
to the stock price.

00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:39.900
So you add that dollar's
worth to that 20% ROE,

00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:44.220
you add that dollar to the
$5, you have a $6 book.

00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:46.980
Two times book is 12.

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:50.370
You have a 10 times earnings.

00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:52.910
By the way, it's
$1.20 in earnings now,

00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:54.330
10 times earnings is 12.

00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:57.030
So the stock price
moves identically

00:10:57.030 --> 00:10:58.840
with the ROE in the business.

00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:02.430
And on a constant valuation,
absent any distributions,

00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:04.680
that's sort of my
very modest level

00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:06.590
of a proof of this notion.

00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:09.660
And it's a valuable
notion that's served us

00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:11.460
well for a long period of time.

00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:14.170
So then my next
question is, well,

00:11:14.170 --> 00:11:19.170
how is it that we identify an
investment which will likely

00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:21.980
lead us to an above-average
rate of return?

00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:28.080
What are the characteristics,
and what kinds of businesses

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:30.160
earn above average
rates of return?

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:37.410
So we say very carefully that
we like to fish in the pond

00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:38.910
of high return businesses.

00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:42.240
And so it makes it much
easier for us to get our focus

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:45.180
upfront, as we start
with the notion of,

00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:49.500
what kind of returns on capital
does that business earn?

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:52.530
And just do something a little
bit interactive here today.

00:11:52.530 --> 00:11:59.280
If I asked Saurabh what
is the typical net margin

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:03.060
of an American business
today in percentage terms,

00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:03.852
what would you say?

00:12:03.852 --> 00:12:04.934
SAURABH MADAAN: 10% to 15%

00:12:04.934 --> 00:12:06.600
CHUCK AKRE: So you
think it's 10, maybe

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:08.310
a little bit above that.

00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:10.440
I'd suggest that
most people answer

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:14.970
that it's probably in mid or
upper single digits, all right?

00:12:14.970 --> 00:12:16.950
And an investment that we own--

00:12:16.950 --> 00:12:18.600
I'll come back
around to later on--

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:21.630
is MasterCard and Visa.

00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:23.850
And does anybody
want to guess what

00:12:23.850 --> 00:12:26.350
the net margins of
MasterCard, Visa are?

00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:27.090
AUDIENCE: 30, 40.

00:12:27.090 --> 00:12:27.500
CHUCK AKRE: There you go.

00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:29.370
So they're in the
mid-30s, you know?

00:12:29.370 --> 00:12:32.820
And you could cut
that in half twice,

00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:35.070
and at worst, it would
be an average business.

00:12:35.070 --> 00:12:37.800
It's extraordinary.

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:39.810
And I actually was
talking to some people

00:12:39.810 --> 00:12:43.290
about this at the Munger
meeting the other day,

00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:46.770
people who are well-schooled in
the market, and good investors,

00:12:46.770 --> 00:12:48.750
and they had no idea.

00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:51.820
They just didn't
think of it that way.

00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:55.080
But that happens to be the way
we think about it, because we

00:12:55.080 --> 00:13:00.662
have this little idea that are
our returns will be affected

00:13:00.662 --> 00:13:03.120
by the quality of the business
and the rate at which it can

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:06.660
grow the economic
value per share.

00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:08.460
And so, by the way,
and MasterCard,

00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:10.350
I can come back
to it, but it also

00:13:10.350 --> 00:13:14.410
then causes us to spend a lot
of time trying to figure out,

00:13:14.410 --> 00:13:16.530
well, why is that so?

00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:19.560
What is it about the essence
of that business that

00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:23.070
allows them to earn returns
that caused them to have

00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:25.740
a big bullseye on their
back, that everybody, all

00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:28.170
other companies want a
piece of a business that

00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:30.042
has returns that are that high?

00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:37.110
So in my office, for some
really unknown reason,

00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:41.700
I had on the desk an old
fashioned milking stool.

00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:43.680
And it had come to
me through my father,

00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:48.100
and it had come to him through
a business partner of his.

00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:52.980
And on the top of this platform,
it stands about that high,

00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:54.880
and it has three legs.

00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:56.921
And the first two
are in the front,

00:13:56.921 --> 00:13:58.920
and the third one is in
the middle, in the back,

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:00.770
and they're splayed.

00:14:00.770 --> 00:14:04.470
And a farmer who was milking
his cow would grab that back leg

00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:06.390
and sort of just stick
it up under his behind

00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:08.190
as he sat down to milk a cow.

00:14:08.190 --> 00:14:11.110
This was in the old days
when they did it by hand.

00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:14.850
And so I was looking at that one
day, and I thought, you know,

00:14:14.850 --> 00:14:17.400
that's actually a
perfect construct

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:20.280
for our notion about what
makes a valuable investment.

00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:22.120
We call it the
three-legged stool.

00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:24.020
So if you looked
at our material,

00:14:24.020 --> 00:14:27.780
our material is resplendent
with these three-legged stools.

00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:29.940
And the first leg of that--

00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:32.010
and we just use this
as a shorthand version,

00:14:32.010 --> 00:14:36.060
a construct to help us
think in very simple terms

00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:38.340
about, well, how do you find
these great investments?

00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:42.360
So the first leg is this issue
of a high return business,

00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:44.670
an exceptional business.

00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:46.600
MasterCard is an
exceptional business.

00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:50.700
The average business earns, call
it 8% after tax on earnings,

00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:52.710
and MasterCard earns 34%.

00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:54.390
That's exceptional.

00:14:54.390 --> 00:14:58.900
I mean, even if the average were
10%, 10% would be exception.

00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:01.140
But I mean, MasterCard's 34%.

00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:03.040
My god, that's
really incredible.

00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:06.240
So the first leg of the
stool that we talk about

00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:08.250
is the quality of the
business enterprise.

00:15:08.250 --> 00:15:11.680
And we spend a lot
of time going down

00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:14.710
this road that we call, what's
the essence of this business?

00:15:14.710 --> 00:15:16.510
What is it about
the business that's

00:15:16.510 --> 00:15:21.290
causing this unbelievable
rates of return to occur?

00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:25.480
The second leg of the stool,
then, goes into the operations.

00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:29.980
It has to do with the
people who run the business.

00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:33.550
And the shorthand
version of that

00:15:33.550 --> 00:15:36.130
is, we want them to have
both skill and integrity.

00:15:36.130 --> 00:15:38.500
But what we say is
that they've got

00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:42.400
a demonstrated record of being
just killers at operating

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:43.330
their business.

00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:47.230
But in addition to that,
they treat us as partners

00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:48.965
even though they don't know us.

00:15:48.965 --> 00:15:50.770
And it's a really
important idea,

00:15:50.770 --> 00:15:54.190
because the reverse
of that is somebody

00:15:54.190 --> 00:15:57.880
I heard describe the other day,
is talking like Warren Buffett

00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:01.150
and acting like Ronald Perlman.

00:16:01.150 --> 00:16:04.480
And there are people out
there, and you'll find them,

00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:06.850
you'll run across
them, who do whatever

00:16:06.850 --> 00:16:09.760
they can to make sure that
public shareholders don't

00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:11.020
get their fair share.

00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:12.020
And we don't want that.

00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:15.040
We want, the same thing
happens at the company level

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:16.790
to happen at the
per-share level.

00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:19.231
And these are
wonderfully-skilled operators

00:16:19.231 --> 00:16:19.730
as well.

00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:22.520
So first leg is the
quality of the business.

00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:24.020
The second leg is
really the quality

00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:25.730
of the people who
run the business.

00:16:25.730 --> 00:16:28.390
And then the third
leg is the issue

00:16:28.390 --> 00:16:30.430
that really helps
create the value,

00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:32.050
and that's the reinvestment.

00:16:32.050 --> 00:16:36.880
And there's a book out,
pretty current now,

00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:42.160
called "Dear Chairman," and it's
about activists, and companies,

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:46.120
and trying to change the
behavior of companies,

00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:49.380
typically, because of their
reinvestment histories.

00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:54.100
And if a business has a great
high return on the owner's

00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:57.040
capital, we would
love for them to be

00:16:57.040 --> 00:17:00.250
able to take all the free cash
they generate and put it back

00:17:00.250 --> 00:17:01.870
into that business
to continue to earn

00:17:01.870 --> 00:17:03.760
those high rates of return.

00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:07.240
It's way more efficient than
paying us a dividend and all

00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:10.869
of those things, and that's what
creates the compounding effect.

00:17:10.869 --> 00:17:16.180
And when I get around to
compounding, you know,

00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:19.329
I always use the example--
you all have seen it

00:17:19.329 --> 00:17:20.800
on the web-- about the penny.

00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:24.130
And so I'm going to ask
this engineer right here,

00:17:24.130 --> 00:17:30.250
would you rather have, in this
hand, $750,000, or a penny

00:17:30.250 --> 00:17:33.032
doubled every day for 30 days.

00:17:33.032 --> 00:17:34.240
So you want the penny, right?

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:35.150
I knew that.

00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:39.626
So instead of $750,000, I'm
going to make it $2 million

00:17:39.626 --> 00:17:42.880
in my right hand, versus
the penny, doubled

00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:43.840
every day for 30 days.

00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:47.670
You still want the penny?

00:17:47.670 --> 00:17:48.560
So I figured that.

00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:51.596
How about $2 million and one?

00:17:51.596 --> 00:17:54.549
Well, I mean, this choice,
it was $2 million before,

00:17:54.549 --> 00:17:55.590
you still took the penny.

00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:59.030
I'm saying, how about if I
make it $2 million and one?

00:17:59.030 --> 00:18:00.238
AUDIENCE: That's a lot money.

00:18:00.238 --> 00:18:01.238
I'd pick the $2 million.

00:18:01.238 --> 00:18:02.410
CHUCK AKRE: Yeah, see?

00:18:02.410 --> 00:18:04.890
Now, who knows, right
off the top of the head,

00:18:04.890 --> 00:18:06.716
what that figure is?

00:18:06.716 --> 00:18:07.715
AUDIENCE: $10.8 million?

00:18:07.715 --> 00:18:09.650
CHUCK AKRE: Yeah,
it's $10.8 million.

00:18:09.650 --> 00:18:14.700
It's $10,737,000 or something
like that and some change.

00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:18.690
And so the simple arithmetic
is, it's 100% return for 30

00:18:18.690 --> 00:18:20.940
periods, you know?

00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:23.610
And that's the power
of compounding.

00:18:23.610 --> 00:18:27.180
And so the really great
thing about compounding,

00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:30.870
I tell people is, if you have a
stock that's gone up 10 times,

00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:33.090
the next time it
doubles, it's gone up 20,

00:18:33.090 --> 00:18:35.850
and the next time it doubles,
it's going up 40 times.

00:18:35.850 --> 00:18:36.720
What?

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:41.570
You know compound interest
and compound return is just--

00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:43.396
it's staggering.

00:18:43.396 --> 00:18:45.270
Actually, I have a
correspondence with Warren

00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:49.290
Buffett about this,
and he always has said,

00:18:49.290 --> 00:18:53.320
as it relates to compounding,
either you get it or you don't.

00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:54.930
And I wrote him a
letter and I said,

00:18:54.930 --> 00:18:56.370
that was not my experience.

00:18:56.370 --> 00:19:01.380
My experience was, I didn't
get it until I experienced it.

00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:03.570
And that goes to this
whole issue of investing.

00:19:03.570 --> 00:19:07.290
I have never been able to learn
from other people's mistakes,

00:19:07.290 --> 00:19:07.920
you know?

00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:09.473
I have to make my own.

00:19:09.473 --> 00:19:10.240
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:17.220
And so this process is
designed to help me,

00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:21.120
and my colleagues, and
partners have focus,

00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:24.920
as it relates to how
we're going to invest.

00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:27.080
Contrary to that
is everything you

00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:31.760
see on the TV in the morning, on
Squawk Box or all those things.

00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:34.310
And they have a
different business model.

00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:37.160
And their business
model is mostly

00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:41.570
supported by financial
institutions and other consumer

00:19:41.570 --> 00:19:44.360
institutions who
want your eyeballs.

00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:47.360
And if it's a brokerage
firm that's sponsoring it,

00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:50.630
the definition of a broker is
to create transactions, right?

00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:52.340
Your advertising
people, they want

00:19:52.340 --> 00:19:55.260
to create transactions, right?

00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:57.590
And what's the best way
to create a transaction

00:19:57.590 --> 00:19:58.970
in the brokerage industry?

00:19:58.970 --> 00:20:01.790
Create what I call
false expectations.

00:20:01.790 --> 00:20:05.658
And the false expectations
are the notion

00:20:05.658 --> 00:20:10.210
that XYZ Company earns
$1.37 in the quarter.

00:20:10.210 --> 00:20:12.220
And the first thing
that happens when

00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:15.310
they release their
quarterly reports is,

00:20:15.310 --> 00:20:18.160
everybody comes out and
says, oh, they earned $1 38.

00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:19.150
They beat by a penny.

00:20:19.150 --> 00:20:19.900
You better buy it.

00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:21.132
Or they earned $1.36.

00:20:21.132 --> 00:20:22.090
They missed by a penny.

00:20:22.090 --> 00:20:22.960
You better buy.

00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:25.240
Well, if you stop
and think about it,

00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:27.550
unless you're very
adept at trading

00:20:27.550 --> 00:20:31.980
the market on a daily basis,
it's a sure loser for you.

00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:34.290
It's bad for your
economic health.

00:20:34.290 --> 00:20:37.270
And as it relates to trading
the market on a daily basis,

00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:39.820
you know, there are very
powerful computer algorithms

00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:43.150
out there using all
kinds of information

00:20:43.150 --> 00:20:46.400
not available to most of us
that are competing against you.

00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:48.740
So I just make that observation.

00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:55.510
We try very hard to be investors
in the value of businesses,

00:20:55.510 --> 00:20:58.030
as opposed to speculators
in the price of shares.

00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:04.590
So now do you remember
what a penny doubled

00:21:04.590 --> 00:21:05.958
every day for 30 years is?

00:21:05.958 --> 00:21:06.894
[LAUGHS]

00:21:06.894 --> 00:21:08.770
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:08.770 --> 00:21:10.195
Don't lose sight of that.

00:21:10.195 --> 00:21:17.530
[LAUGHS] So we tell our clients
and our prospective clients

00:21:17.530 --> 00:21:21.850
that our goal is to
compound their capital

00:21:21.850 --> 00:21:25.300
at an above average
rate, while incurring

00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:27.492
a below average level of risk.

00:21:27.492 --> 00:21:29.200
So let's start with
the back end of that.

00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:32.540
What do we mean by a below
average level of risk?

00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:35.950
Well, the businesses
we own typically

00:21:35.950 --> 00:21:38.660
have the following
characteristics.

00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:40.900
They have more growth.

00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:44.300
They have higher
returns on capital.

00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:48.200
They have stronger balance
sheets, and frequently,

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:50.870
lower valuations
than the market.

00:21:50.870 --> 00:21:54.230
So on their face,
they are less risky.

00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:56.540
It's just, it's observable.

00:21:56.540 --> 00:21:59.480
It doesn't have anything
to do with volatility,

00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:02.300
because our belief
is, volatility is

00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:04.850
a risk only in the short run.

00:22:04.850 --> 00:22:09.020
If you have an obligation
in a year to buy a house

00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:11.720
or to do something
like that, you probably

00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:14.810
don't want to speculate
with that cash

00:22:14.810 --> 00:22:16.760
that you have set
aside for that.

00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:18.710
But if it's five
years or three years,

00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:21.020
you have the ability,
put that money

00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:22.610
to work and have
it work for you.

00:22:22.610 --> 00:22:26.570
So volatility is not in
our lexicon, basically,

00:22:26.570 --> 00:22:28.850
in terms of risk.

00:22:28.850 --> 00:22:30.830
And we've already talked
about what average is,

00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:34.070
and we think average is roughly
high single digits, maybe

00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:37.550
low double digits,
and it has to do

00:22:37.550 --> 00:22:40.730
with what the overall
interest rate environment is.

00:22:40.730 --> 00:22:43.850
And so there are lots of
investors, Michael Steinhardt

00:22:43.850 --> 00:22:47.020
and people like that,
who retired with records

00:22:47.020 --> 00:22:49.040
of very high rates of returns.

00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:50.630
But that was
against the backdrop

00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:54.980
that, in January of
1981, the long bond,

00:22:54.980 --> 00:22:58.100
the 30-year treasury
yielded 15 and 3/8%,

00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:00.470
and prime rate was 21 and 1/2%.

00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:02.720
So it was in a backdrop
in which rates were much

00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:04.570
higher than they are currently.

00:23:04.570 --> 00:23:08.360
So returns in all businesses
are lower these days,

00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:11.240
and my guess is, average
these days would probably

00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:16.780
be at the low end of that sort
of high single digits number.

00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:19.870
And because it's an average
we're talking about,

00:23:19.870 --> 00:23:22.910
it does not mean that we will
have a return in any given

00:23:22.910 --> 00:23:24.740
year that's better than that.

00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:28.490
It means, to us, over a
period of 5 years or 10 years,

00:23:28.490 --> 00:23:32.970
our returns are very likely
to be well above that number.

00:23:32.970 --> 00:23:36.700
But I would say, observably,
maybe a third of the years

00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:40.220
in the last 25 we maybe
have done less well in them

00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:44.450
than the S&amp;P, which, we use that
simply because it's available.

00:23:44.450 --> 00:23:47.480
We don't care what indices
people want to compare us to.

00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:48.950
That's their choice.

00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:53.250
We spend no time
thinking about that.

00:23:53.250 --> 00:24:01.875
And so, I border on
salesmanship here a little bit,

00:24:01.875 --> 00:24:05.110
and you can edit this
out, Saurabh, if you want.

00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:10.940
But the record that we have
accomplished for our clients,

00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:13.000
I'll give you some
numbers very quickly.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:16.250
Our separately-managed
accounts which

00:24:16.250 --> 00:24:19.040
we've been doing
for 27 years have

00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:24.050
compounded at 12.7%,
versus the S&amp;P

00:24:24.050 --> 00:24:27.560
at that period of time of 9.4%.

00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:30.800
So you know it's
330 basis points

00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:35.000
over the market, compounded
annually for 27 years.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.520
We have a private investment
partnership that's

00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:40.320
been around for 23 years.

00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:45.770
And it's compounded it at 15
and 1/4%, net to the partners,

00:24:45.770 --> 00:24:51.450
versus 9.2% for the S&amp;P during
that specific period of time.

00:24:51.450 --> 00:24:56.270
So 23 years, 600 basis
points over the market.

00:24:56.270 --> 00:24:59.600
We've run two mutual funds
in our life, the FBR Focus

00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:02.480
Fund and then subsequently,
the Akre Focus Fund.

00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:08.060
Those two records
combined, the number

00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:18.380
is 13.2%, versus 7.7%, 550
over the S&amp;P for that period

00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:20.090
of time, 19 years.

00:25:20.090 --> 00:25:22.340
And then, simply the
fund that we currently

00:25:22.340 --> 00:25:24.380
manage, the Akre
Focus Fund, which

00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:27.290
has been in existence a
little over seven years,

00:25:27.290 --> 00:25:30.570
it's a 125 basis
points over the market.

00:25:30.570 --> 00:25:33.200
And the market has
been 13 and 1/2%

00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:35.270
in that seven-year
period of time.

00:25:35.270 --> 00:25:38.520
So I just say that, and I
don't print them for you,

00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:40.910
but I just say
that to say this is

00:25:40.910 --> 00:25:43.550
the outcome of
using this thought

00:25:43.550 --> 00:25:46.005
process in our investments.

00:25:49.050 --> 00:25:52.380
Saurabh has asked that maybe
we talk a couple of minutes

00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:53.950
about some examples.

00:25:53.950 --> 00:25:57.680
And going way back into
the '80s and early '90s,

00:25:57.680 --> 00:26:00.120
we invested in a company
called International Speedway

00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:01.230
Corporation.

00:26:01.230 --> 00:26:05.280
And International Speedway
had the characteristics of,

00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:07.480
it was 12 times earnings.

00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:12.150
It was at 25%, 26%
return on equity.

00:26:12.150 --> 00:26:15.810
It had an owner-operator
who owned 60% of the stock,

00:26:15.810 --> 00:26:18.030
and it had a lot of
growth in front of it,

00:26:18.030 --> 00:26:21.510
because it was the
dominant racetrack

00:26:21.510 --> 00:26:23.940
owner in NASCAR racing.

00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:26.430
And they owned International
Speedway, and Darlington,

00:26:26.430 --> 00:26:27.660
and Talladega.

00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:29.620
They went on to build some more.

00:26:29.620 --> 00:26:32.280
It's not a very attractive
business, in my mind,

00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:34.020
today for a bunch of reasons.

00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:36.400
The man who ran it, Bill
France, passed away.

00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:38.190
His daughter is taking it over.

00:26:38.190 --> 00:26:43.074
She doesn't have the same
skill set that he had.

00:26:43.074 --> 00:26:44.490
But during that
period of time, we

00:26:44.490 --> 00:26:47.640
made 10 to 20 times our
money on that business

00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:50.520
over more than 10 years.

00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:53.430
Another company that was also
in the entertainment-related

00:26:53.430 --> 00:26:56.000
business was a company
called Penn National Gaming.

00:26:59.130 --> 00:27:02.310
I mean, there's a lot of
serendipity about the way

00:27:02.310 --> 00:27:04.130
these things come out.

00:27:04.130 --> 00:27:06.570
A young man who was working
for me at the time, talking

00:27:06.570 --> 00:27:08.820
to another investor,
said to us, well,

00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:11.500
you ought to look at the 10-Q
of this company called Penn

00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:13.590
Gaming, and we did.

00:27:13.590 --> 00:27:16.230
And Penn Gaming at the
time, in Pennsylvania--

00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:18.360
Saurabh was in
Philadelphia there--

00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:22.470
in Pennsylvania had five
off-track betting parlors

00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:25.620
in Pennsylvania, and
they were limited

00:27:25.620 --> 00:27:27.490
by licenses in the state.

00:27:27.490 --> 00:27:30.070
There were only a total
of 23 in the state.

00:27:30.070 --> 00:27:31.950
So you had a high
barrier to entry

00:27:31.950 --> 00:27:34.090
because of a regulatory issue.

00:27:34.090 --> 00:27:38.570
And what was interesting
in this 10-Q was,

00:27:38.570 --> 00:27:42.950
the fifth off-track betting
location that they built

00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:47.710
cost them $2 million
to build it out.

00:27:47.710 --> 00:27:54.230
And they had $1.6 million
of operating income

00:27:54.230 --> 00:27:56.420
in the first 12 or 14 months.

00:27:56.420 --> 00:27:59.630
I'm saying, that's not a
bad business, you know?

00:27:59.630 --> 00:28:02.210
I took it upon myself
to go meet the CEO.

00:28:02.210 --> 00:28:04.550
We talked about the
importance of people.

00:28:04.550 --> 00:28:08.280
He was a real estate
developer by background.

00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:12.800
His father had control of this
old race track, Penn National

00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:15.830
Gaming, that had-- because
in Pennsylvania, they'd

00:28:15.830 --> 00:28:18.230
given the licenses for
the off-track betting

00:28:18.230 --> 00:28:22.250
to the legalized gambling
arena, the racetrack, the horse

00:28:22.250 --> 00:28:26.130
racetrack business,
and he was ambitious.

00:28:26.130 --> 00:28:31.010
And as a builder and developer,
he borrowed a lot of money

00:28:31.010 --> 00:28:32.010
in his lifetime.

00:28:32.010 --> 00:28:35.630
And he told me that he had
been able to avoid ever having

00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:38.060
his wife sign-- co-sign a loan.

00:28:38.060 --> 00:28:42.380
That's a really important
measure of risk understanding.

00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:44.510
And so I got involved.

00:28:44.510 --> 00:28:46.640
And it was after
that, that he bought

00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:49.790
another racetrack in West
Virginia, and about an hour

00:28:49.790 --> 00:28:52.130
and a half from
Washington and Baltimore,

00:28:52.130 --> 00:28:54.050
and converted that
into a casino that

00:28:54.050 --> 00:28:57.410
now has 5,000 slot machines.

00:28:57.410 --> 00:29:02.060
And he went on become
the largest non-Las Vegas

00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:06.390
and non-Atlantic City casino
operator in the country.

00:29:06.390 --> 00:29:10.520
And it's another case where we
made 10 to 20 times our money

00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:11.750
in our accounts.

00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:16.790
Again, this was a situation
of high returns on capital,

00:29:16.790 --> 00:29:21.270
low valuation, major
shareholder owner and operator,

00:29:21.270 --> 00:29:22.460
and a low valuation.

00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:27.136
It was a huge opportunity
for growth, going forward.

00:29:27.136 --> 00:29:30.080
And then, in current times,
we talked a little bit

00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:33.500
about MasterCard.

00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:36.980
Some things that are
interesting about MasterCard,

00:29:36.980 --> 00:29:41.300
we purchased originally
in February of 2010.

00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:43.970
And this is when the
Dodd-Frank discussions

00:29:43.970 --> 00:29:46.790
were going on in Congress
after the financial crisis,

00:29:46.790 --> 00:29:49.460
and more particularly, about
the Durbin amendment, which

00:29:49.460 --> 00:29:53.210
had to do with domestic
debit transactions.

00:29:53.210 --> 00:29:56.930
The long and short of it is, we
bought the stock at an average

00:29:56.930 --> 00:30:01.700
price of $22.20 in
February of 2010.

00:30:01.700 --> 00:30:06.710
Today, it's $109,
something like that.

00:30:06.710 --> 00:30:10.610
So we've made five times our
money in six years, seven,

00:30:10.610 --> 00:30:12.020
you know, something like that.

00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:15.350
And the reason was that
here is a business that

00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:19.250
had fantastic returns, as
we've already talked about.

00:30:19.250 --> 00:30:20.210
It had a low valuation.

00:30:20.210 --> 00:30:24.140
The valuation in
February of 2010

00:30:24.140 --> 00:30:26.840
was something like
13 or 14 times.

00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:29.360
It was growing its free cash
flow per share at a rate

00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:30.890
much faster than that.

00:30:30.890 --> 00:30:33.200
And we had a good
thing happen with it,

00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:37.560
that we'd been to meet the
new CEO, Ajay Banga, who's

00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:43.540
a Punjabi, and a really bright,
interesting, lovely guy.

00:30:43.540 --> 00:30:46.240
And so, you and I
were talking earlier

00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:48.290
about the interaction of people.

00:30:48.290 --> 00:30:52.220
And so we see him in a
setting with other executives

00:30:52.220 --> 00:30:55.400
in his firm, and he's first
name basis, kidding with them.

00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:56.630
They kid with him.

00:30:56.630 --> 00:30:58.130
All of these things
are important.

00:30:58.130 --> 00:30:59.510
Just the things--
you know, I talked

00:30:59.510 --> 00:31:00.884
about reading
business biography,

00:31:00.884 --> 00:31:03.350
you get a feel for
how people behave,

00:31:03.350 --> 00:31:05.890
and how they deal with
their colleagues, and so on.

00:31:05.890 --> 00:31:08.240
And so we've made
five times our money

00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:10.910
in six short years in an
extraordinary business.

00:31:10.910 --> 00:31:13.430
Now, if you remember
what I talked about,

00:31:13.430 --> 00:31:17.420
the third leg,
reinvestment, their returns

00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:20.480
are so high that
they can't possibly

00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:24.170
find another place to reinvest
their money at that rate

00:31:24.170 --> 00:31:25.160
and get that return.

00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:30.590
So our compounding is diminished
modestly because of that.

00:31:30.590 --> 00:31:33.900
So they buy in scads of
stock, they pay a dividend,

00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:36.680
they invest a lot
in new technologies,

00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:41.934
all relating to what I call the
electronic exchange of value.

00:31:41.934 --> 00:31:43.850
I mean, that's really
the business they're in,

00:31:43.850 --> 00:31:47.750
and we don't know what form
factor it will take in years,

00:31:47.750 --> 00:31:50.480
but they're well-positioned
in all of the things that

00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:52.420
are going on today.

00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:55.610
Another company that
is relatively new to us

00:31:55.610 --> 00:31:59.600
is Moody's, and we bought
our Moody's originally

00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:01.760
in January of 2012.

00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:07.340
And we paid about $39, a
little less than $39 for it.

00:32:07.340 --> 00:32:09.650
Today, it's $110.

00:32:09.650 --> 00:32:14.150
And so we have a case
where we've made 2 and 1/2,

00:32:14.150 --> 00:32:15.890
2 and 3/4 times our money.

00:32:15.890 --> 00:32:20.310
Again, the same idea,
a great business.

00:32:20.310 --> 00:32:25.940
After Dodd-Frank, the government
authorized another six or eight

00:32:25.940 --> 00:32:28.370
rating agencies to exist.

00:32:28.370 --> 00:32:31.040
I'm sure there's not a person
in this room who can tell you

00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:32.360
the name of any of them.

00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:33.830
It's a market-driven thing.

00:32:33.830 --> 00:32:36.380
It's not regulatory-driven.

00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:39.110
And so any company
that issues debt

00:32:39.110 --> 00:32:40.850
has to go out and
get a rating on it.

00:32:40.850 --> 00:32:43.550
And there are really
three rating agencies--

00:32:43.550 --> 00:32:45.860
Moody's, S&amp;P, and Fitch.

00:32:45.860 --> 00:32:49.550
The market is divided,
like, 40%, 40%, and 20%.

00:32:49.550 --> 00:32:52.460
Fitch has had 20%
for nearly 100 years.

00:32:52.460 --> 00:32:54.880
They just can't seem to grow
it any larger than that,

00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:56.450
and it's market-driven.

00:32:56.450 --> 00:32:59.210
And if you sit on the
board of a company that's

00:32:59.210 --> 00:33:01.970
about to raise
debt, and you go out

00:33:01.970 --> 00:33:04.460
and you don't get a
rating on your debt,

00:33:04.460 --> 00:33:08.320
and you have a bad effect in the
market, you have a liability.

00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:13.430
So it's a fascinating business
that, again, market forces

00:33:13.430 --> 00:33:17.000
allow it to have very high
returns on its capital.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:21.520
Another company that we've
been involved with for,

00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:26.390
gee, almost 10 years is
a company called Enstar.

00:33:26.390 --> 00:33:30.260
And I sat on their
board for five years

00:33:30.260 --> 00:33:32.210
because I wanted to
try to understand

00:33:32.210 --> 00:33:33.660
how the business
really operated,

00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:36.050
and it's a complicated business.

00:33:36.050 --> 00:33:39.980
They buy insurance
which is in runoff.

00:33:39.980 --> 00:33:43.820
And that is, operating insurance
companies periodically decide,

00:33:43.820 --> 00:33:45.860
well, we don't want to
be in homeowners anymore,

00:33:45.860 --> 00:33:48.500
or we don't want to be
in long haul trucking

00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:51.350
anymore, or whatever, and
they run that business off.

00:33:51.350 --> 00:33:53.360
And they're required
to keep assets

00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:56.120
to support those liabilities
by the regulators

00:33:56.120 --> 00:33:59.020
until that business is gone.

00:33:59.020 --> 00:34:03.020
And executives in
businesses like insurance

00:34:03.020 --> 00:34:06.380
who have aspirations
in their career

00:34:06.380 --> 00:34:08.290
would not like to be
placed in the runoff.

00:34:08.290 --> 00:34:11.250
It's sort of the back
room of the business.

00:34:11.250 --> 00:34:14.310
And this group of people
who started this company

00:34:14.310 --> 00:34:18.980
are chartered
accountants by training.

00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:23.270
And they're headquartered
in South Africa, and Dublin,

00:34:23.270 --> 00:34:25.070
and Bermuda, and London.

00:34:25.070 --> 00:34:26.719
And they travel
all over the world

00:34:26.719 --> 00:34:28.969
all the time, in
search of trying

00:34:28.969 --> 00:34:31.310
to find these little
pieces of business.

00:34:31.310 --> 00:34:33.830
I've seen instances where they
worked on a piece of business

00:34:33.830 --> 00:34:35.239
for five or six years.

00:34:35.239 --> 00:34:38.389
They're very patient,
very disciplined.

00:34:38.389 --> 00:34:43.580
And when I got involved
in this company in 2007,

00:34:43.580 --> 00:34:45.230
it had had a record
of compounding book

00:34:45.230 --> 00:34:48.500
value per share a
little bit north of 20%.

00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:51.469
But it was also
three times book.

00:34:51.469 --> 00:34:59.810
And I paid $102.90 for
my first shares in 2007.

00:34:59.810 --> 00:35:02.170
And today, it's
worth about $195.

00:35:02.170 --> 00:35:03.860
So it's not been a
very good investment.

00:35:03.860 --> 00:35:07.770
And you know, I mean, I've
essentially doubled my money,

00:35:07.770 --> 00:35:09.050
but it's taken 10 years.

00:35:09.050 --> 00:35:13.940
So that number, obviously,
roughly around 7%, compounded.

00:35:13.940 --> 00:35:18.230
But then the valuation got
more attractive periodically,

00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:22.940
and in 2009, I was able
to buy some stock at $56.

00:35:22.940 --> 00:35:25.740
So my return there
is nearly four times

00:35:25.740 --> 00:35:26.800
and that sort of stuff.

00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:29.440
And so, that goes back to this
issue I was talking about,

00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:31.990
your starting valuation.

00:35:31.990 --> 00:35:35.870
And you know, when I paid three
times book for this company

00:35:35.870 --> 00:35:40.290
in '07 and it had a history
of compounding book at 20%,

00:35:40.290 --> 00:35:43.280
had it been able to
continue to compound at 20%,

00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:44.600
I would have done much better.

00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:46.640
But their rate of
return has come down,

00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:48.800
just like it has
in all businesses,

00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:52.520
as we've had this secular
decline in interest rates

00:35:52.520 --> 00:35:54.770
for 36 years as a backdrop.

00:35:54.770 --> 00:35:58.610
Everybody's business returns
are lower, nearly everybody.

00:35:58.610 --> 00:36:04.580
And so those are sort of
five examples of businesses

00:36:04.580 --> 00:36:06.890
that we own or have
owned, where we've

00:36:06.890 --> 00:36:11.330
had these great returns as a
result of using this process,

00:36:11.330 --> 00:36:15.140
using our process, we call
it the three-legged stool,

00:36:15.140 --> 00:36:17.690
of identifying
businesses that we

00:36:17.690 --> 00:36:23.360
think are likely to give us a
return that's above average.

00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:24.830
I'm getting near the end here.

00:36:24.830 --> 00:36:26.550
You're getting anxious.

00:36:26.550 --> 00:36:27.140
I know that.

00:36:27.140 --> 00:36:29.600
So I'll give you a few
quotes out of Einstein,

00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:32.780
because I find him
simply a great thinker.

00:36:32.780 --> 00:36:34.400
You should make
everything as simple

00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:37.700
as possible, but no simpler.

00:36:37.700 --> 00:36:39.800
You'll have to think
about it a minute.

00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:42.800
The difference between
stupidity and genius

00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:45.728
is that genius has
its limits, you know?

00:36:45.728 --> 00:36:48.170
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:48.170 --> 00:36:52.400
We cannot solve our problems
with the same thinking that we

00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:56.240
used to create them, huh?

00:36:56.240 --> 00:37:01.700
The only source of
knowledge is experience.

00:37:01.700 --> 00:37:04.460
Imagination is more
important than knowledge.

00:37:04.460 --> 00:37:06.110
I told Saurabh that's
what it actually

00:37:06.110 --> 00:37:09.290
says on the front of my book.

00:37:09.290 --> 00:37:12.950
And the true test
of intelligence

00:37:12.950 --> 00:37:16.860
is not knowledge,
but imagination.

00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:19.195
So we put our own little
quote on the end of that.

00:37:19.195 --> 00:37:22.800
It's an old saw which says
that good judgment comes

00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:25.667
from experience, and experience
comes from bad judgment.

00:37:25.667 --> 00:37:31.980
[CHUCKLES] So in conclusion, we
work in a town with one traffic

00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:33.090
light.

00:37:33.090 --> 00:37:37.440
And I say it makes the decision
process so much simpler.

00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:39.840
Einstein, make things
as simple as possible.

00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:42.090
We tell people when they
get to the light, turn.

00:37:42.090 --> 00:37:45.990
Sooner or later, they'll
get to us in town.

00:37:45.990 --> 00:37:49.950
And what's really important is
that, in a campus like this,

00:37:49.950 --> 00:37:54.360
or in Central Park South in
New York, or in downtown San

00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:57.450
Francisco, or Los Angeles,
we'd be surrounded

00:37:57.450 --> 00:38:02.570
by hundreds of people who
are very bright and very

00:38:02.570 --> 00:38:03.981
interesting.

00:38:03.981 --> 00:38:06.230
And the reason we're in a
town with one traffic light,

00:38:06.230 --> 00:38:10.490
away from that, is that their
stuff would be intellectually

00:38:10.490 --> 00:38:13.400
appealing to us and
it would distract us

00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:15.849
from what it is we do well.

00:38:15.849 --> 00:38:17.390
And that's a really
important notion.

00:38:17.390 --> 00:38:19.700
Warren talked about
getting out of New York

00:38:19.700 --> 00:38:22.250
and going back to Omaha
when he was a young man.

00:38:22.250 --> 00:38:23.830
It's the same idea.

00:38:23.830 --> 00:38:27.530
And not that being in
your midst wouldn't

00:38:27.530 --> 00:38:30.830
be unbelievably fulfilling,
or being in New York,

00:38:30.830 --> 00:38:31.840
or something like that.

00:38:31.840 --> 00:38:35.330
It's that It distracts
us from what we do well.

00:38:35.330 --> 00:38:37.220
And so, that's a
really important thing,

00:38:37.220 --> 00:38:39.890
is you're thinking about
being an investor is

00:38:39.890 --> 00:38:42.380
to create the situation
for yourself, that you have

00:38:42.380 --> 00:38:47.210
the ability to apply what it is
that you've learned and found

00:38:47.210 --> 00:38:50.750
valuable in investing, as
opposed to listening what

00:38:50.750 --> 00:38:53.240
Squawk Box, or your next door
neighbor, or your suite mate

00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:54.340
says, something like that.

00:38:57.810 --> 00:39:00.420
Make things as simple as
possible, but no simpler.

00:39:00.420 --> 00:39:03.900
Imagination is more important
than knowledge, you know?

00:39:03.900 --> 00:39:07.350
So I say, simply use
your own observations.

00:39:07.350 --> 00:39:08.940
It's very important.

00:39:08.940 --> 00:39:13.260
Peter Lynch used to talk about
buying the things that you

00:39:13.260 --> 00:39:14.889
see happening.

00:39:14.889 --> 00:39:16.680
In the shopping center,
there's a new store

00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:21.210
and they're getting a lot
of traffic, or whatever.

00:39:21.210 --> 00:39:24.180
Do you all know
who Peter Lynch is?

00:39:24.180 --> 00:39:26.340
I mean, he had a
really unusual talent.

00:39:26.340 --> 00:39:29.380
He had 1,200 securities in
the Fidelity Magellan Fund.

00:39:29.380 --> 00:39:31.320
He ran it for eight
or nine years,

00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:33.630
and had a phenomenal
record and so on.

00:39:33.630 --> 00:39:36.600
But he had 1,200 securities.

00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:37.470
I mean, imagine.

00:39:37.470 --> 00:39:39.172
So I was in, seeing him one day.

00:39:39.172 --> 00:39:41.630
And what he would do-- we were
talking about this earlier--

00:39:41.630 --> 00:39:44.640
is if he found an
industry that he liked,

00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:47.187
he would buy every
company in that industry,

00:39:47.187 --> 00:39:48.270
put them in his portfolio.

00:39:48.270 --> 00:39:50.280
And then he'd eliminate
them one at a time,

00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:54.180
as he kept honing in on who
were the best ones and so on.

00:39:54.180 --> 00:39:55.550
It's not a talent that I have.

00:39:58.890 --> 00:40:00.450
And then I say, just
because you have

00:40:00.450 --> 00:40:03.910
a big brain doesn't mean you
could be good at investing.

00:40:03.910 --> 00:40:05.490
And that's an
important thing, too.

00:40:05.490 --> 00:40:07.650
And finally, there
is no correct answer.

00:40:07.650 --> 00:40:08.670
There is no correct way.

00:40:08.670 --> 00:40:11.010
This is just the
way it works for us.

00:40:11.010 --> 00:40:13.680
I'm happy to have
the opportunity

00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:15.720
to share these few
thoughts with you.

00:40:15.720 --> 00:40:17.515
And I guess we'll
have a few Q&amp;A.

00:40:17.515 --> 00:40:19.140
SAURABH MADAAN: Yes,
thank you so much.

00:40:19.140 --> 00:40:19.614
CHUCK AKRE: Right, thank you.

00:40:19.614 --> 00:40:20.562
Yeah.

00:40:20.562 --> 00:40:23.062
SAURABH MADAAN: If you can take
a seat, that'd be fantastic.

00:40:23.062 --> 00:40:23.620
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:23.620 --> 00:40:26.510
I just have couple of
quick questions for you.

00:40:26.510 --> 00:40:30.360
And thank you for showing us a
glimpse of the sense of humor

00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:33.284
that I was talking
to you guys about.

00:40:33.284 --> 00:40:37.230
Sort of just before the
talk started, you and I

00:40:37.230 --> 00:40:38.604
were talking about family.

00:40:38.604 --> 00:40:39.270
CHUCK AKRE: Yes.

00:40:39.270 --> 00:40:41.610
SAURABH MADAAN: And you were
talking about your kids.

00:40:41.610 --> 00:40:43.740
And if I remember
correctly, none of them

00:40:43.740 --> 00:40:45.430
are doing what you
did in your career.

00:40:45.430 --> 00:40:46.350
CHUCK AKRE: Correct.

00:40:46.350 --> 00:40:48.690
SAURABH MADAAN: And I
mean, over the years

00:40:48.690 --> 00:40:52.050
of successful investing,
by the numbers that you've

00:40:52.050 --> 00:40:55.080
shared with us, I'm sure you've
made a little bit of money

00:40:55.080 --> 00:40:57.120
for yourself.

00:40:57.120 --> 00:41:00.170
CHUCK AKRE: I'm not
worried about my next meal.

00:41:00.170 --> 00:41:01.920
SAURABH MADAAN: Yeah,
that's what I meant.

00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:04.170
I was just curious,
what are your thoughts?

00:41:04.170 --> 00:41:08.730
You said that you believe it is
important to let your kids have

00:41:08.730 --> 00:41:10.110
their own struggles in life.

00:41:10.110 --> 00:41:13.050
So talk to us a little bit about
family, about raising kids,

00:41:13.050 --> 00:41:15.460
about giving money away, maybe.

00:41:15.460 --> 00:41:19.620
CHUCK AKRE: So my
wife and I spend

00:41:19.620 --> 00:41:21.450
a reasonable amount
of time figuring out

00:41:21.450 --> 00:41:27.065
how we can put the money
to use in places that

00:41:27.065 --> 00:41:29.760
will be advantaged by it,
as it relates to the things

00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:34.110
that we're interested in, or
land conservation, health care

00:41:34.110 --> 00:41:38.600
issues, education, shelter,
things of that nature.

00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:41.770
And so we pursue
that significantly,

00:41:41.770 --> 00:41:44.830
as so many people do.

00:41:44.830 --> 00:41:48.360
And then it creates an
issue within the family,

00:41:48.360 --> 00:41:51.930
where we've developed an asset
base that we certainly never

00:41:51.930 --> 00:41:54.630
expected to have.

00:41:54.630 --> 00:41:59.340
And we've seen, particularly
where we live and work,

00:41:59.340 --> 00:42:00.340
in Middleburg Virginia--

00:42:00.340 --> 00:42:01.960
You know, Paul
Mellon lived there,

00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:04.140
and Jackie Mars lives
there, and there's

00:42:04.140 --> 00:42:05.850
a lot of wealth in that area.

00:42:05.850 --> 00:42:08.670
And we've had a
chance to see people

00:42:08.670 --> 00:42:13.230
who have been, well, as we would
say, they're on scholarship,

00:42:13.230 --> 00:42:15.760
or they're on full scholarship.

00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:19.260
And we see some of those
whose lives are really

00:42:19.260 --> 00:42:22.440
up-ended because of the fact
that they have a vast amount

00:42:22.440 --> 00:42:24.790
of capital available to them.

00:42:24.790 --> 00:42:27.570
They don't have to
work, and they don't.

00:42:27.570 --> 00:42:30.930
And so, the phrase
that my wife and I use

00:42:30.930 --> 00:42:34.080
is, we don't want to deprive
our children of the opportunity

00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:35.020
to struggle.

00:42:35.020 --> 00:42:37.980
Struggle in my own life
has been very valuable.

00:42:37.980 --> 00:42:39.750
I was telling Daniel
yesterday, there

00:42:39.750 --> 00:42:41.400
have been a number
of times in my life,

00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:45.450
that if your glasses had the
right rose color in them,

00:42:45.450 --> 00:42:48.430
my assets would
equal my liabilities.

00:42:48.430 --> 00:42:51.220
But you had to have the right
color rose glasses, you know?

00:42:51.220 --> 00:42:55.630
And so those experiences
have been valuable to me

00:42:55.630 --> 00:42:58.677
as a human being, and as
an investor, and so on.

00:42:58.677 --> 00:43:01.260
And so, that's one of the things
that we think about, and talk

00:43:01.260 --> 00:43:03.027
about, and work out.

00:43:03.027 --> 00:43:04.110
SAURABH MADAAN: Thank you.

00:43:04.110 --> 00:43:05.460
That was great.

00:43:05.460 --> 00:43:07.662
You also mentioned that
you are a voracious reader.

00:43:07.662 --> 00:43:08.370
CHUCK AKRE: Yeah.

00:43:08.370 --> 00:43:09.870
SAURABH MADAAN: So
can you mention--

00:43:09.870 --> 00:43:11.784
CHUCK AKRE: And a
slow reader, too.

00:43:11.784 --> 00:43:14.200
SAURABH MADAAN: And they say
that slow reading is actually

00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:15.030
real reading, but--

00:43:15.030 --> 00:43:19.890
[LAUGHS] So I was curious.

00:43:19.890 --> 00:43:23.070
Name a few books, if
you can, that you think

00:43:23.070 --> 00:43:25.650
are maybe under-appreciated,
or a little bit

00:43:25.650 --> 00:43:29.490
under the radar, or
people would learn things

00:43:29.490 --> 00:43:31.590
from reading about them.

00:43:31.590 --> 00:43:34.890
CHUCK AKRE: Well, you know, I
mentioned that pretty new book

00:43:34.890 --> 00:43:36.635
out called "Dear Chairman."

00:43:36.635 --> 00:43:44.060
And actually, it's a lesson
in behavior of human beings.

00:43:44.060 --> 00:43:48.660
It's a lesson in thinking
about making judgments about

00:43:48.660 --> 00:43:51.210
whether or not
business executives use

00:43:51.210 --> 00:43:56.154
their assets well, in terms
of compounding their capital.

00:43:56.154 --> 00:43:58.320
I mentioned the book, "100
to 1 in the Market," that

00:43:58.320 --> 00:43:59.790
came out in '72.

00:43:59.790 --> 00:44:02.070
I've talked about that
a lot, and so people are

00:44:02.070 --> 00:44:03.900
reasonably familiar with it.

00:44:03.900 --> 00:44:06.930
But a few years ago,
they'd never heard of it.

00:44:06.930 --> 00:44:11.117
And the big idea in that is
the issue of compounding.

00:44:11.117 --> 00:44:13.200
Even though he doesn't
talk about that explicitly,

00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:15.240
he lists all kinds
of characteristics

00:44:15.240 --> 00:44:18.120
that you'd find in businesses
which might do this.

00:44:18.120 --> 00:44:21.840
Obviously, low valuations,
small value to begin with,

00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:25.450
all of those kinds of things.

00:44:25.450 --> 00:44:27.310
And maybe I'll think
of some others, but--

00:44:27.310 --> 00:44:28.500
SAURABH MADAAN: Sure.

00:44:28.500 --> 00:44:31.230
Chris Mayer, I believe, has
done sort of an updated work--

00:44:31.230 --> 00:44:31.980
CHUCK AKRE: Right.

00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:32.310
He did.

00:44:32.310 --> 00:44:33.930
SAURABH MADAAN: --in the
recent years on the same book.

00:44:33.930 --> 00:44:34.280
CHUCK AKRE: Yep.

00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:35.696
SAURABH MADAAN:
But I was curious.

00:44:35.696 --> 00:44:37.572
You have this workbench
in your portfolio--

00:44:37.572 --> 00:44:38.280
CHUCK AKRE: Yeah.

00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:38.720
Yep.

00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:39.390
SAURABH MADAAN: --the last 10%--

00:44:39.390 --> 00:44:39.720
CHUCK AKRE: Yeah.

00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:40.219
Yeah.

00:44:40.219 --> 00:44:42.540
SAURABH MADAAN: --of so
many small positions.

00:44:42.540 --> 00:44:45.120
And you mentioned this
idea of 100-baggers.

00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:45.870
CHUCK AKRE: Right.

00:44:45.870 --> 00:44:47.620
SAURABH MADAAN: So
I was just curious,

00:44:47.620 --> 00:44:50.340
what are some 100-baggers that
you see around that, you know--

00:44:50.340 --> 00:44:51.090
CHUCK AKRE: Well--

00:44:51.090 --> 00:44:52.756
SAURABH MADAAN: --you
can share with us?

00:44:52.756 --> 00:44:54.480
CHUCK AKRE: I've only
had two in my life.

00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:55.740
And I still own those two.

00:44:55.740 --> 00:44:56.531
SAURABH MADAAN: OK.

00:44:56.531 --> 00:44:59.114
CHUCK AKRE: And that's Berkshire
Hathaway and American Tower.

00:44:59.114 --> 00:45:00.030
SAURABH MADAAN: Right.

00:45:00.030 --> 00:45:03.390
CHUCK AKRE: And the
fact of the matter

00:45:03.390 --> 00:45:04.890
is, you only really need one.

00:45:04.890 --> 00:45:07.470
And I mean, and that's
a really important issue

00:45:07.470 --> 00:45:10.380
as it relates to investing,
is you really only need

00:45:10.380 --> 00:45:13.450
to have one great success.

00:45:13.450 --> 00:45:17.040
And that is, as it relates to
whatever your goals might be.

00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:23.220
And so the quest is,
for me, the search

00:45:23.220 --> 00:45:26.230
is trying to figure out what the
characteristics of those are.

00:45:26.230 --> 00:45:30.330
So if you think
about my comments,

00:45:30.330 --> 00:45:33.630
and three-legged stool,
and high return businesses,

00:45:33.630 --> 00:45:37.740
and so on, our view is
that, most of the time,

00:45:37.740 --> 00:45:39.840
you can buy these
exceptional businesses

00:45:39.840 --> 00:45:42.370
at reasonable valuations.

00:45:42.370 --> 00:45:45.780
So in today's market, you
can buy American Tower,

00:45:45.780 --> 00:45:49.160
or you can buy Moody's,
or you can buy MasterCard

00:45:49.160 --> 00:45:54.300
at probably something like 19
times next year's free cash

00:45:54.300 --> 00:45:57.290
flow, 2018.

00:45:57.290 --> 00:46:01.820
And that means an earnings
yield of 5% or 5.1%.

00:46:01.820 --> 00:46:05.030
If we're still at a 1.5%
interest rate environment,

00:46:05.030 --> 00:46:09.290
that's an attractive deal,
you know, that comparison.

00:46:09.290 --> 00:46:12.200
If the business does,
in fact, compound

00:46:12.200 --> 00:46:13.760
the free cash flow,
or book value,

00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:17.660
or whatever is appropriate for
that company, in the mid-teens

00:46:17.660 --> 00:46:21.140
and you pay in the upper
teens for it, we like to say,

00:46:21.140 --> 00:46:22.347
you'll get to heaven.

00:46:22.347 --> 00:46:23.540
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:23.540 --> 00:46:26.480
And you'll do so
without much risk.

00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:29.570
Periodically, the
market gives us

00:46:29.570 --> 00:46:32.690
an opportunity to buy one
of these great businesses

00:46:32.690 --> 00:46:34.130
at a discount.

00:46:34.130 --> 00:46:38.390
And then even more rarely,
it'll give us the opportunity

00:46:38.390 --> 00:46:40.380
to buy one of these at a steal.

00:46:40.380 --> 00:46:46.890
So Berkshire Hathaway, I started
buying back in the late '70s.

00:46:46.890 --> 00:46:53.250
And in the late '70s, my initial
purchases were at $105 a share,

00:46:53.250 --> 00:46:57.120
and that's the stock today, you
know, is at $250,000 a share.

00:46:57.120 --> 00:46:59.160
So that works.

00:46:59.160 --> 00:47:03.780
American Tower is, to
me, a business that

00:47:03.780 --> 00:47:06.300
is situated like Microsoft was.

00:47:06.300 --> 00:47:08.400
Microsoft was at the
intersection of the growth

00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:09.750
of the personal computer.

00:47:09.750 --> 00:47:11.244
They had the operating system.

00:47:11.244 --> 00:47:12.660
If you wanted a
personal computer,

00:47:12.660 --> 00:47:15.320
you ended up basically going
through that tollbooth,

00:47:15.320 --> 00:47:16.260
the Microsoft.

00:47:16.260 --> 00:47:20.310
And so it was a fabulously
profitable business.

00:47:20.310 --> 00:47:22.900
The growth of the wireless
communication business

00:47:22.900 --> 00:47:26.520
which, as we know, started
with 1G, and 2G, and 3G,

00:47:26.520 --> 00:47:29.400
and 4G, now they're
talking about 5G,

00:47:29.400 --> 00:47:33.630
each of those G's requires
a denser network of towers,

00:47:33.630 --> 00:47:35.970
more sophisticated
antennas, and so on.

00:47:35.970 --> 00:47:38.430
And the place they put
those are on the antennas,

00:47:38.430 --> 00:47:43.110
by and large, so that the tower
business is in that same--

00:47:43.110 --> 00:47:46.870
is in a nearly identical kind
of position that Microsoft was.

00:47:46.870 --> 00:47:50.290
And I'm not a technology guy,
so I'm already over my head.

00:47:50.290 --> 00:47:53.520
But that's a really
important notion,

00:47:53.520 --> 00:47:56.430
in terms of the exceptional
nature of a business

00:47:56.430 --> 00:47:58.980
and the ability to grow it.

00:47:58.980 --> 00:48:02.700
And their marginal
return at American Tower

00:48:02.700 --> 00:48:06.810
for an additional
tenant above about 1.2,

00:48:06.810 --> 00:48:10.710
their marginal return is
in the high 90% range.

00:48:10.710 --> 00:48:12.030
It's unbelievable.

00:48:12.030 --> 00:48:14.370
So once they put
that asset in place

00:48:14.370 --> 00:48:17.670
and they get above breakeven,
the marginal return

00:48:17.670 --> 00:48:21.540
is in the 90%
range, north of 90%.

00:48:21.540 --> 00:48:23.910
And what American
Tower has done is

00:48:23.910 --> 00:48:26.580
they now are in 15 countries.

00:48:26.580 --> 00:48:31.380
And when we started
with them in 1999,

00:48:31.380 --> 00:48:34.110
they were in the United
States, Mexico, and Brazil.

00:48:34.110 --> 00:48:36.460
Now they're in total
of 15 countries,

00:48:36.460 --> 00:48:39.360
including United States.

00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:43.800
And all of the things that
were telephony-related

00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:48.120
in the late '90s were
the hottest things

00:48:48.120 --> 00:48:51.810
since the 4th of
July firecrackers.

00:48:51.810 --> 00:48:56.190
And 2000 came, and all
of those businesses

00:48:56.190 --> 00:48:59.280
fell off the cliff,
because they were levered.

00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:01.887
Well, American Towers,
levered 16 to 1.

00:49:01.887 --> 00:49:02.970
I mean, it's unbelievable.

00:49:02.970 --> 00:49:05.640
Their huge cash flow
businesses and so on.

00:49:05.640 --> 00:49:09.870
And they had to
de-lever that company,

00:49:09.870 --> 00:49:14.010
selling assets on a distressed
basis in a declining market.

00:49:14.010 --> 00:49:18.940
And in the beginning of
2002, the stock was $5.

00:49:18.940 --> 00:49:22.790
It had gotten as high
as in the $60s in '99.

00:49:22.790 --> 00:49:26.820
Beginning of 2002, it was $5.

00:49:26.820 --> 00:49:30.570
We bought a position at $5,
and we were really proud of it.

00:49:30.570 --> 00:49:32.220
In September, it was $2.

00:49:32.220 --> 00:49:33.264
AUDIENCE: [SCOFFS]

00:49:33.264 --> 00:49:35.430
CHUCK AKRE: We got on the
plane and went see the CEO

00:49:35.430 --> 00:49:37.320
in Boston, Steve Dodge.

00:49:37.320 --> 00:49:39.180
He was the founder.

00:49:39.180 --> 00:49:44.580
And what the market
was focused on was,

00:49:44.580 --> 00:49:48.180
they had about $6 billion of
debt, but they had $200 million

00:49:48.180 --> 00:49:53.730
that came due in November
of 2003, 15 months hence.

00:49:53.730 --> 00:49:57.300
And it was payable
in cash or shares

00:49:57.300 --> 00:50:00.450
at the option of the company.

00:50:00.450 --> 00:50:03.270
They were desperately
trying to raise cash.

00:50:03.270 --> 00:50:05.580
They couldn't use their
bank lines to pay that off.

00:50:05.580 --> 00:50:09.180
You can't use the bank to pay
off somebody else's capital.

00:50:09.180 --> 00:50:11.640
And so, the lower
the price went,

00:50:11.640 --> 00:50:13.590
the more dilution an
existing shareholder

00:50:13.590 --> 00:50:17.610
was going to have if they
used shares instead of cash.

00:50:17.610 --> 00:50:24.030
And in October, the stock got
to an inter-day low of $0.60.

00:50:24.030 --> 00:50:27.720
We bought several million
shares at about $0.80.

00:50:27.720 --> 00:50:29.010
I still own mine.

00:50:29.010 --> 00:50:32.260
We have many of our
clients still own theirs.

00:50:32.260 --> 00:50:36.000
That's the other example
of a north of 100-bagger.

00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:38.430
What was interesting was
that the business itself

00:50:38.430 --> 00:50:43.500
was a terrific business
masked by a bad balance sheet.

00:50:43.500 --> 00:50:46.290
And you had great
people working hard

00:50:46.290 --> 00:50:47.940
to get it straightened
out, to preserve

00:50:47.940 --> 00:50:51.000
their own investment, their
own foundations, and that sort

00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:52.710
of stuff.

00:50:52.710 --> 00:50:56.040
And it was just, so I
think to myself, well,

00:50:56.040 --> 00:50:59.190
did I make a mistake by not
really putting a lot of money

00:50:59.190 --> 00:50:59.910
to work?

00:50:59.910 --> 00:51:01.350
I was very timid.

00:51:01.350 --> 00:51:03.960
If I say we bought a few
million shares at $0.80,

00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:06.760
that's not a lot of money.

00:51:06.760 --> 00:51:09.122
And so, if I'd been
more confident,

00:51:09.122 --> 00:51:10.830
I would have put a
lot of money in there,

00:51:10.830 --> 00:51:14.580
and I'd be fighting with
Warren Buffett for the place

00:51:14.580 --> 00:51:16.506
on that list, you know?

00:51:16.506 --> 00:51:18.240
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:18.240 --> 00:51:20.030
But you get the idea.

00:51:20.030 --> 00:51:23.010
So the point is that,
periodically, you

00:51:23.010 --> 00:51:26.340
get a chance to buy one of these
great businesses at a bargain,

00:51:26.340 --> 00:51:30.195
and even, in a rare
opportunity, at just a steal.

00:51:30.195 --> 00:51:31.320
SAURABH MADAAN: Yes, Chuck.

00:51:31.320 --> 00:51:34.740
I have one final
question for you.

00:51:34.740 --> 00:51:36.660
There was a 2006
interview of yours

00:51:36.660 --> 00:51:37.910
that I was mentioning to you--

00:51:37.910 --> 00:51:38.130
CHUCK AKRE: Yeah.

00:51:38.130 --> 00:51:40.680
SAURABH MADAAN: --before
we began the conversation.

00:51:40.680 --> 00:51:43.482
And Penn National Gaming, I
think, was one of the stocks--

00:51:43.482 --> 00:51:44.190
CHUCK AKRE: Yeah.

00:51:44.190 --> 00:51:46.680
SAURABH MADAAN: --that was
a big part of your portfolio

00:51:46.680 --> 00:51:51.250
at that time, and so was
this company called Markel.

00:51:51.250 --> 00:51:54.090
So I remember the stock
price from that interview

00:51:54.090 --> 00:51:57.060
because it was 4-4-4.

00:51:57.060 --> 00:51:58.885
And today, it's roughly--

00:51:58.885 --> 00:51:59.760
CHUCK AKRE: 9-9-9.

00:51:59.760 --> 00:52:00.634
SAURABH MADAAN: Yeah.

00:52:00.634 --> 00:52:02.910
It's slightly more than double.

00:52:02.910 --> 00:52:04.664
But it's also been
over 11 years.

00:52:04.664 --> 00:52:05.330
CHUCK AKRE: Yes.

00:52:05.330 --> 00:52:06.705
SAURABH MADAAN:
So the reason I'm

00:52:06.705 --> 00:52:08.970
asking is, does there
come a point, even

00:52:08.970 --> 00:52:11.430
in the life of a
good compounder,

00:52:11.430 --> 00:52:15.510
where the valuations are
becoming optimistic enough,

00:52:15.510 --> 00:52:18.540
and the future rates of
returns that you can see

00:52:18.540 --> 00:52:22.740
are low, where one should
maybe rotate or move

00:52:22.740 --> 00:52:24.160
from one position to another.

00:52:24.160 --> 00:52:28.212
How do you think about
selling, in other words?

00:52:28.212 --> 00:52:29.670
CHUCK AKRE: Well,
one side of that.

00:52:29.670 --> 00:52:32.160
I think the most
difficult thing to do

00:52:32.160 --> 00:52:36.790
in our business is to not sell
if you're a long-term investor.

00:52:36.790 --> 00:52:41.760
And that is, the ones
that are really great

00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:43.980
have been hard for
me to identify.

00:52:43.980 --> 00:52:48.210
It's taken me a long time to
understand how good the ones

00:52:48.210 --> 00:52:50.460
are that are really good.

00:52:50.460 --> 00:52:57.400
And almost everybody has less
time in the market than I do.

00:52:57.400 --> 00:53:00.510
But for those who have fewer
years experience, you know,

00:53:00.510 --> 00:53:03.610
if you get a
disappointing quarter

00:53:03.610 --> 00:53:08.190
or you get something like that,
temptation is often the sell.

00:53:08.190 --> 00:53:10.140
And if you've got
a really great one,

00:53:10.140 --> 00:53:12.120
that's probably a bad decision.

00:53:12.120 --> 00:53:14.490
Doesn't mean you can't
lighten up a little bit,

00:53:14.490 --> 00:53:16.710
and try to time it
and buy some more.

00:53:16.710 --> 00:53:18.460
We don't do that very well.

00:53:18.460 --> 00:53:21.080
So we try not to
fool around with.

00:53:21.080 --> 00:53:25.080
In the case of
Markel, like Enstar,

00:53:25.080 --> 00:53:27.590
they'd had a record of 20
years of compounding book

00:53:27.590 --> 00:53:29.400
value per share.

00:53:29.400 --> 00:53:32.220
In 2006, that was,
like, 20% a year.

00:53:32.220 --> 00:53:34.710
And so like Enstar, which
was three times book when

00:53:34.710 --> 00:53:36.780
I bought it, Markel
got to the point

00:53:36.780 --> 00:53:39.630
where it was 2 and 1/2 times
book or something like that.

00:53:39.630 --> 00:53:42.000
And the fact that
I've only doubled

00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:48.990
my money in 10 years, so 7%
return, is a result of that.

00:53:48.990 --> 00:53:52.697
By paying a valuation, which,
in hindsight, was too high,

00:53:52.697 --> 00:53:54.780
because the rate at which
they could compound book

00:53:54.780 --> 00:53:58.470
was less than I had
imagined it might be.

00:53:58.470 --> 00:54:01.200
Part of that backdrop
is this whole issue

00:54:01.200 --> 00:54:04.140
of this 36-year secular
decline in rates.

00:54:04.140 --> 00:54:08.910
All businesses have done less
well over the last 5 or 10

00:54:08.910 --> 00:54:11.120
years because of the
decline in rates,

00:54:11.120 --> 00:54:13.230
and Markel is an example.

00:54:13.230 --> 00:54:17.940
And they've now, in
my mind, fully adopted

00:54:17.940 --> 00:54:21.270
the Berkshire model of creating
a business inside the holding

00:54:21.270 --> 00:54:23.640
company that's completely
away from insurance.

00:54:23.640 --> 00:54:25.360
They call it Markel Ventures.

00:54:25.360 --> 00:54:28.140
Got $1.2 billion in revenue,
as you said, about $130 million

00:54:28.140 --> 00:54:29.340
in EBITDA.

00:54:29.340 --> 00:54:32.310
So it's roughly at 10
times EBITDA margin.

00:54:32.310 --> 00:54:35.220
And that will give
them the flexibility

00:54:35.220 --> 00:54:38.370
of being able to put capital
to work, other than simply

00:54:38.370 --> 00:54:42.360
in a passive portfolio, rather
in an insurance business when

00:54:42.360 --> 00:54:44.310
rates aren't attractive to them.

00:54:44.310 --> 00:54:46.980
And they're one of the very
small number of insurance

00:54:46.980 --> 00:54:49.890
companies that have the
discipline of only putting

00:54:49.890 --> 00:54:54.960
money to work when
their expected return is

00:54:54.960 --> 00:54:57.199
a positive combined ratio.

00:54:57.199 --> 00:54:58.740
SAURABH MADAAN: So
talking of names--

00:54:58.740 --> 00:55:00.300
I think we have
about a minute left--

00:55:02.850 --> 00:55:04.560
you did mention
Visa and MasterCard,

00:55:04.560 --> 00:55:06.510
and I think you own both.

00:55:06.510 --> 00:55:09.522
You also mentioned Moody's,
and it a duopoly with S&amp;P.

00:55:09.522 --> 00:55:10.230
CHUCK AKRE: Yeah.

00:55:10.230 --> 00:55:10.650
Right.

00:55:10.650 --> 00:55:12.191
SAURABH MADAAN: I
was wondering, what

00:55:12.191 --> 00:55:15.580
are your thoughts on
S&amp;P as a business?

00:55:15.580 --> 00:55:19.520
It has the same market
shares, even outside the US,

00:55:19.520 --> 00:55:20.970
the similar structures.

00:55:20.970 --> 00:55:22.720
But, curious to hear what you

00:55:22.720 --> 00:55:23.220
think.

00:55:23.220 --> 00:55:25.050
CHUCK AKRE: So in
the last few weeks,

00:55:25.050 --> 00:55:28.830
Moody's announced that they'd
come to an agreement with,

00:55:28.830 --> 00:55:31.650
I don't know, a government
agency, the DOJ or somebody,

00:55:31.650 --> 00:55:34.620
in terms of paying a fine
relating to their activity

00:55:34.620 --> 00:55:37.110
around the crisis.

00:55:37.110 --> 00:55:39.630
The amount of the fine
was substantially lower

00:55:39.630 --> 00:55:40.995
than Wall Street expected.

00:55:43.716 --> 00:55:49.620
And S&amp;P paid a much larger
fine more than a year ago,

00:55:49.620 --> 00:55:52.150
because the SEC had
the goods on them.

00:55:52.150 --> 00:55:55.290
They had a string of emails
about people inside talking

00:55:55.290 --> 00:55:58.620
about how this stuff was
crazy, and they didn't exist

00:55:58.620 --> 00:55:59.160
at Moody's.

00:55:59.160 --> 00:56:03.210
That is, if they existed, the
government never found them.

00:56:03.210 --> 00:56:06.180
And so, there is a
modest difference.

00:56:06.180 --> 00:56:08.020
And when the--

00:56:08.020 --> 00:56:09.090
SAURABH MADAAN: So they might
have cultural differences.

00:56:09.090 --> 00:56:10.423
CHUCK AKRE: Cultural difference.

00:56:10.423 --> 00:56:12.660
And so, when John
Neff, my partner,

00:56:12.660 --> 00:56:15.860
joined the firm in
November of 2009,

00:56:15.860 --> 00:56:19.901
one of the names that he
suggested that we invest in was

00:56:19.901 --> 00:56:20.400
Moody's.

00:56:20.400 --> 00:56:21.941
And I said, oh,
we'll never buy that.

00:56:21.941 --> 00:56:24.160
I mean, their behavior
during the financial crisis

00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:26.610
was atrocious.

00:56:26.610 --> 00:56:28.500
He was a very patient guy.

00:56:28.500 --> 00:56:30.930
And he said, well,
I think you should

00:56:30.930 --> 00:56:34.980
meet this Ray, the CEO, and
the other people, and so on.

00:56:34.980 --> 00:56:36.600
And over the next
couple of years,

00:56:36.600 --> 00:56:40.800
I had the chance to go
and meet the executives

00:56:40.800 --> 00:56:43.200
two or three times, and I
made my own judgment about it.

00:56:43.200 --> 00:56:46.620
And so, it wasn't until
2012 that we actually

00:56:46.620 --> 00:56:48.000
bought Moody's shares.

00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:50.940
But again, it was not much
different, price-wise,

00:56:50.940 --> 00:56:54.240
than it had been in 2009 or '10.

00:56:54.240 --> 00:56:55.230
So that was an example.

00:56:55.230 --> 00:56:57.690
And what I've concluded
then, still believe,

00:56:57.690 --> 00:57:02.730
was their behavior during
that prior crisis was stupid,

00:57:02.730 --> 00:57:09.330
but it wasn't wrong
and it wasn't illegal.

00:57:09.330 --> 00:57:14.310
And you know, I mean, that sort
of stuff, as the e-mails showed

00:57:14.310 --> 00:57:16.980
was the problem at S&amp;P, where
people thought what they

00:57:16.980 --> 00:57:18.900
were doing was just foolish.

00:57:18.900 --> 00:57:21.720
There was no such evidence
of that at Moody's.

00:57:21.720 --> 00:57:24.300
And so I think there's a
cultural difference of some--

00:57:24.300 --> 00:57:26.910
so we haven't gone
over there at S&amp;P.

00:57:26.910 --> 00:57:31.110
We did it in Visa, because
we have concentration

00:57:31.110 --> 00:57:33.360
limits in the mutual fund.

00:57:33.360 --> 00:57:36.930
We did it with SBA and
in the Towers space

00:57:36.930 --> 00:57:39.770
because we have
concentration limits.

00:57:39.770 --> 00:57:41.700
But we haven't done it
with S&amp;P and Moody's.

00:57:41.700 --> 00:57:42.163
SAURABH MADAAN: OK.

00:57:42.163 --> 00:57:42.626
Great.

00:57:42.626 --> 00:57:43.334
CHUCK AKRE: Yeah.

00:57:43.334 --> 00:57:45.562
SAURABH MADAAN: We
are out of time.

00:57:45.562 --> 00:57:46.770
But thank you so much, Chuck.

00:57:46.770 --> 00:57:47.030
CHUCK AKRE: Thank you very much.

00:57:47.030 --> 00:57:47.710
SAURABH MADAAN: This
has been fantastic.

00:57:47.710 --> 00:57:48.030
CHUCK AKRE: Yeah.

00:57:48.030 --> 00:57:49.250
SAURABH MADAAN: Thank you all
for being a great audience.

00:57:49.250 --> 00:57:50.000
CHUCK AKRE: Great.

00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:51.050
Thank you all.

00:57:51.050 --> 00:57:54.400
