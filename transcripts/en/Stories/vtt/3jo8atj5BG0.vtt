ADRIAN BASCHUK: First,
let me start off

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.460
by saying that I
freaking love Nepal.

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:11.690
I've been here three
times in the last 10 years

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:13.730
covering everything
from the Maoist rebels

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:16.480
to the country's
failing health system.

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.330
It is such a study in contrast.

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:19.920
I mean, it is the
Himalayan kingdom

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.770
replete with some of the
greatest natural beauty

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:25.200
unparalleled on Earth.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.990
And yet, it's one of the
poorest countries in the world,

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:28.614
as well.

00:00:28.614 --> 00:00:30.030
When I heard about
the earthquake,

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.590
I knew I had to get here.

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:35.750
There was some foundations that
were bring volunteers over.

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.880
So I hitched a ride, and here
I am on the ground to see it.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.310
And right off the bat,
we're looking at a tent camp

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:46.150
here where people have been
sleeping out in the open.

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.950
And you can see this building
literally right here,

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.600
the entire outer wall is
just missing and collapsed.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.286
And yet all around
on this block,

00:00:55.286 --> 00:00:57.370
it's seemingly untouched.

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.256
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.227
There's a big aftershock
show right here.

00:01:04.227 --> 00:01:07.029
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:09.194
Whoa.

00:01:09.194 --> 00:01:10.110
Everything's swinging.

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.060
The trees--

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:12.310
The ground just keeps swaying.

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.302
So you literally feel like
it's just still going on.

00:01:17.302 --> 00:01:18.760
It's like both
sides of the street.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.843
You've got that building
that's just leaning over.

00:01:21.843 --> 00:01:24.108
And this rubble here.

00:01:24.108 --> 00:01:29.180
Rubble here, crushed car there.

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.800
It's really, really
overwhelming.

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.575
So we just came across
this house here.

00:01:35.575 --> 00:01:37.860
Looks like an
accordion, literally.

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.520
It's like some houses
were spared here.

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.760
And then you've got
a house like this.

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:43.540
Your house?

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.131
SPEAKER 1: Yes,
this is my house.

00:01:46.131 --> 00:01:48.350
ADRIAN BASCHUK: I'm sorry.

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:49.160
What do you do now?

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.129
How do you rebuild?

00:01:51.129 --> 00:01:51.920
SPEAKER 1: Nothing.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:52.710
ADRIAN BASCHUK: Do you move?

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.050
Do you go somewhere else?

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.176
SPEAKER 1: Yeah, this ground.

00:01:56.176 --> 00:01:57.260
ADRIAN BASCHUK: In a tent?

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.992
SPEAKER 1: Yes.

00:01:57.992 --> 00:01:59.450
ADRIAN BASCHUK:
But your family OK?

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:00.795
SPEAKER 1: Yes,
all our family OK.

00:02:00.795 --> 00:02:01.170
ADRIAN BASCHUK: Yeah?

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.640
So that's most important.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.674
SPEAKER 1: Most
important, family OK.

00:02:05.674 --> 00:02:07.840
ADRIAN BASCHUK: Walking
around here is no easy task.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:13.820
I walked along this path here
and then came across this.

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:15.950
What the hell?

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.828
I mean, this is a whole
city block demolished.

00:02:20.828 --> 00:02:22.812
Because you're the
commanding officer here,

00:02:22.812 --> 00:02:23.804
what's going on
with this building?

00:02:23.804 --> 00:02:25.387
It's literally like
a 60-degree angle.

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.958
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:34.397 --> 00:02:35.938
ADRIAN BASCHUK:
What's going on here?

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.950
How about you?

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:45.280
Where were you?

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.863
What happened?

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.280
Sankhu's a town northeast of
Kathmandu towards the epicenter

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.730
of the second earthquake.

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:12.460
It's 3,359 years old.

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:14.810
I filmed there after
the first quake,

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:16.945
just before the
second one, and can't

00:03:16.945 --> 00:03:19.320
imagine what it looked like
after already being hit hard.

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.580
They were rebuilding in
Sankhu, in Kathmandu, and all

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.620
over Nepal, and this
second quake hit.

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.570
And now, there have been 24
aftershocks here since then.

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:34.160
But in a weird way,
they ground you.

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.160
They make you realize the
power of nature, sure.

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.840
But more than that,
the earth rumbles.

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.420
And despite tragedy, you
see people strive and go

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.400
on no matter how
shaky the ground.

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.340

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.834
SPEAKER 2: On another
episode of "Seeker Stories"--

00:03:53.834 --> 00:03:55.250
ADRIAN BASCHUK:
So we're basically

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.390
going undercover here.

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.305
Yeah, those were cage
of bears, I think.

00:03:59.305 --> 00:04:01.245
Stop, stop, stop.

00:04:01.245 --> 00:04:07.346
So there's one, two, three,
four, five right there.

00:04:07.346 --> 00:04:09.595
SPEAKER 2: This episode is
a part of "Seeker Stories."
