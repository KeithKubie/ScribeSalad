At the end of Unit 4, we built a search index that could respond to queries

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and would do this by going through each entry one at a time,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
checking if the keyword matched the word we were looking for,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and then responding with a result for that.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I wanted to ask Gabriel Weinberg, the creator of DuckDuckGo, how well that approach will work

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
if we have a large index with lots of queries.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
You'll find that with a large index with lots of queries, it will be too slow.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
A typical search engine should respond in under a second and often times much faster.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
But with that algorithm, having to go through each link like that one after the other,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
you could be on the order of seconds or even longer.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
So what we're going to learn this unit is how to make this much faster.
