00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.290 position:70%
&gt;&gt; I am thrilled to welcome you to the second
annual online conference for educators,

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:08.850
and I know this is not the first
session today for some of you.

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:15.880 position:58%
The session today, building deeper
connections to the CCSS, C3 framework

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:19.130 position:69%
and civic competencies with primary sources.

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.780 position:58%
I'd like to introduce our presenters.

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:29.570 position:66%
Mara Grujanac is the program director for
the Barat Education Foundation, TPS-Barat,

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:36.570 position:70%
teaching with primary sources program and the
our American voice civic engagement program.

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.560 position:61%
Mara is responsible for the development
and implementation of both programs,

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:45.910
as well as managing foundation
employees and contractors.

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:51.160 position:75%
Joining Mara will be Pamela McGreer, member of
the curriculum and professional development team

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.150 position:63%
for the TPS-Barat program for four years

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:58.600 position:59%
and a retired national board-certified
middle school librarian.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.620
Joining Pamela and Mara will be
Julie Schaul, a learning consulting

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:09.610 position:75%
who develops transforming professional
development and designs inquiry-based strategies

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.920
to enhance literacy, critical
thinking and civic competencies.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.750
Mara, Pamela and Julie, welcome.

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.310 position:75%
&gt;&gt; I'm Julie Schaul, and welcome to the session.

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.900 position:73%
We're really happy to have you join us tonight.

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.670 position:73%
We're going to start with a quick collaborative
primary source analysis, and then we'll work

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.480 position:66%
at how teaching with primary sources
aligns to the common core state standards,

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:36.820 position:56%
supports the C3 framework and builds
your students to these competencies.

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.800 position:63%
So, some of you may be familiar with the
library's primary source analysis tool,

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.370 position:56%
which is a really great way to
start teaching with primary sources.

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:48.040 position:64%
It is available in print or digital form.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.870 position:69%
And while we won't be using this actual form
today, you will be following its format.

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:57.720 position:56%
TPS Program Director Mara Grujanac
will lead you through this activity.

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.300
&gt;&gt; Good evening everyone.

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.560 position:64%
Thank you so much for joining us tonight.

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.010
It's really nice to be here.

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:06.630 position:59%
So you see a photograph on the screen.

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.490
Our first task is going to
be to observe the image.

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:16.440 position:59%
Please take a moment to look at the
details individually and collectively.

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.580
Spend a moment observing the photo.

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.460
Please describe what you see.

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:25.430
What do you notice first?

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.640
Anne, a girl wearing a crinoline
slip under a gingham dress.

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.120 position:64%
Patty sees two people surrounded by a lot
of people who seem to be harassing them.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.860
Carrie sees taunting.

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.870
Logan sees faces.

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.730 position:63%
Teresa's building on those gentlemen and
saying they may be making bunny ears.

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.620
You might also want to look
at what objects and people,

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.070 position:73%
or objects are shown and how are they arranged?

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:58.970 position:59%
LaSean sees a young, a black young
lady walking with people taunting her.

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:04.190 position:69%
Interesting, Faith, that you say you see two
strong-willed well-dressed African-Americans

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:05.220
leading the group.

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:11.940 position:72%
Angie sees an African-American girl with a
group taunting, white men and boys behind her.

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.360
That's great.

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.570
Thank you for all of your answers.

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.660
Let's move along now.

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.960
Our next task is going to be
to reflect on what you see.

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:26.500 position:72%
We're going to start to make connections
between our background knowledge and the image

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.370
to create inferences or hypotheses.

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.550 position:67%
Let's think about the purpose of the photo.

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:35.420
What's it make you think or feel?

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:41.920 position:70%
When you come into the chat box, try to point
to the evidence that makes you feel that way

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.610
when you're looking at the picture.

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:50.590 position:67%
Faith notices that it's a study in contrast
between the continence of the two figures

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:53.440 position:70%
in the foreground compared to the background.

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.630
Ashton wonders if this is
from the Civil Rights period.

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:01.260 position:56%
Mary Johnson noticed that the, all
the boys are behind the young woman.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:10.640 position:75%
As you're seeing this, try to connect with your
background knowledge so that we get some context

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.950
for why you're saying what you see.

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:17.140
[Inaudible] sees a young woman
who's wearing her best outfit.

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:19.610 position:75%
Behind her are men who seem to be harassing her.

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:23.510 position:70%
She feels sad and scared for the young woman.

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:27.100
[Inaudible] feels empathy for
her fellow black Americans.

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:31.680 position:58%
Teresa thinks this is probably in the
south during the Civil Rights era.

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:36.130
Discomfort or different expressions
toward the camera.

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:40.550
Interesting that some people are
saying that she's very brave.

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:44.130
Braver than they are, and that
they feel shamed, nervousness.

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:49.420 position:70%
I feel determination in the young woman's
face, which makes me feel admiration for her.

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:50.860
That's a great comment, Mary.

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:55.150
Carrie says at first she felt sad,
but she sees the determination grip

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:56.900
on the girl and the man's faces.

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:00.050
Really you can very well see that.

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:02.820 position:58%
So let's move along a little bit now.

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:07.910
I'd like you to think about, what
makes you wonder about this image?

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:12.070 position:69%
Share what makes you question in this image?

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:16.730
As you ask the questions,
you might look at the photo

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:19.670
and see if you can find any
clues to those questions as well.

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:24.040
Ashton wants to know what
happened before this photo.

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:29.720 position:70%
I wonder why the man, if the man to the right
is the father of the young woman, right?

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:33.080
I wonder that as well, Patty.

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:34.780
Angie's wondering where this is.

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:38.110
Where is she going, and why
are they following her?

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:39.790
And who the young woman is.

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:43.130 position:73%
Samantha wonders why there's so many teenagers.

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:47.090 position:69%
And Theodore wonders what's about to happen.

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:48.880
And how does she feel, Lashaun.

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:54.380 position:61%
I think Teresa wonders if it's
desegregation in a school in the south.

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:56.160 position:67%
Carrie's wondering what's in front of them.

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.130
That's very interesting insight.

00:05:58.130 --> 00:05:59.810
What's out of the frame?

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:05.420
That sort of goes to the purpose
or meaning behind the photo.

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:08.190 position:66%
Teresa's wondering how large the crowd is.

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:10.430
So thank you for your questions.

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:17.690 position:73%
I'd like to move along to an example of an
analysis tool that was completed with students.

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:22.020
Tools like this are available
from the Library of Congress.

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:24.280 position:67%
And they help structure students' thinking.

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:28.200
But sometimes students have
difficulty completing the forms.

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:34.290 position:66%
So, I'd like to point out that you'll find
companion sheets with guiding questions

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:37.570
in the teacher section of the
Library of Congress website.

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:41.640
These questions can be used as
a guide for the teacher to aid

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:43.990
in the investigation of the source.

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:50.280 position:67%
Teachers use these tools in a number of
ways, and they ask students to create lists

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:55.250 position:63%
with sometimes minimum numbers of
observations in each column or questions

00:06:55.250 --> 00:07:02.990 position:73%
to make sure there's enough information to peak
the students' curiosity and get their buy-in.

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:10.850 position:61%
Have any of you used the primary source
analysis tools or those questions?

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:17.540
Anne, we will definitely be
sharing the URL for these images,

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:20.320 position:61%
as well as where you can find them now.

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:23.900
And I understand that the
recording of this will be online

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:27.560 position:63%
and on our slides as we point to things.

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:33.820 position:58%
Most of our slides are hyperlinked to
the sources that we are referencing.

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:40.210 position:59%
I see Samantha and David have both
used the primary source analysis tool.

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:45.030
Let's move on to the bibliographic
record for this.

00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:48.610
So for those of you who have
used primary source analysis,

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:52.880 position:56%
when might you use the bibliographic
record with your students?

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:57.980 position:66%
Anne uses it after they observe the image.

00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:01.050
And Anne, why do you choose
to use that afterward?

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:05.130 position:56%
No, we're not having a conversation,
but you can give us more insight

00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:07.690
after they've observed Lashaun.

00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:12.930
Anne notices that you should
maybe get their reaction first.

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:14.760
And David says afterward.

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:19.130 position:69%
After writing the questions, right Samantha.

00:08:19.130 --> 00:08:21.650
A number of teachers use that.

00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:25.660 position:58%
We always suggest that it's important
to share the bibliographic record

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:27.940 position:56%
as part of their finding the source.

00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:31.580 position:58%
But it also gives students an
opportunity to gain more information.

00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:38.860 position:75%
Did you gain a little bit more information about
this picture from the bibliographic record?

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:47.700 position:59%
And what did you notice from the
bibliographic record about this image?

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:48.470
Date and place.

00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:52.570 position:56%
Interesting that Patty Wench notices
that, commented that she used

00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:54.840 position:70%
to not include the bibliographic information.

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:57.980
However, now she does because
it gives students more details.

00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:03.270 position:73%
You're right, Samantha, it is a school dilemma.

00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:07.000 position:58%
And it does provide more information.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.860
So I'd like to move on now for
you, and notice that at the bottom

00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:17.030 position:56%
of the primary source analysis tool,
there's a further investigation box.

00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:21.370
It can be used to help students
identify more important questions

00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:25.760
and develop a research strategy
for finding additional answers.

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:30.540 position:67%
Our sample questions are different from the
question box because we completed this part

00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:33.560 position:56%
after students had the bibliographic
information.

00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:38.020
So we think that students can
use this information to move

00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:41.610
on and do further investigations.

00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:49.830
Our students ask, under the further
investigation into the time period,

00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:52.610 position:58%
what's the significance of the event?

00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:58.240
And what connections can I make
between this and current events?

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:03.250 position:56%
Anne likes customizing the questions
to fit the students and the content.

00:10:03.250 --> 00:10:11.890 position:59%
You can use the who, what, where and
when as well in further investigation.

00:10:11.890 --> 00:10:16.980
I'd like to take a moment now
to give you a little background

00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:21.010 position:61%
on where you can find this information.

00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:28.080 position:67%
This is from an exhibition at the library
called Brown versus the Board of Education.

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:35.320
This photo we analyzed can be
found in this online exhibition.

00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:38.470 position:75%
You'll see here that there's some curator notes.

00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:43.240 position:58%
The curator note on the left provides
additional background information

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:46.310
to Miss Counts and the time period.

00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:51.990
So if you were to look at this
image directly from the Library

00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:53.890 position:61%
of Congress, you would get a thumbnail.

00:10:53.890 --> 00:10:58.010
And some of you who are familiar
with the library's resources,

00:10:58.010 --> 00:11:02.330 position:63%
understand that sometimes you have to go
to the library to get the larger item.

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:11.460 position:67%
But through this online exhibition, you can
get the larger image and see it enlarged.

00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:15.070
Are there any questions about
the short analysis that we did

00:11:15.070 --> 00:11:22.070 position:69%
on Dorothy Counts, Dorothy Geraldine Counts?

00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:28.050
If not, I'd like to pass this
presentation baton back to Julie.

00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:29.960
&gt;&gt; Thanks Mara.

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:33.190
I'd like us to consider, just
as you have all experienced,

00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:38.250 position:67%
how teaching with primary sources naturally
engages learners in the inquiry process.

00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:44.140 position:75%
To interact with primary sources, we must read
closely, evaluate the content and consider bias,

00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:50.790 position:69%
interpret perspectives, make inferences, ask
questions and pull together disparate pieces

00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:54.750
of evidence to think conceptually
and draw conclusions.

00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:57.850
With primary sources, there
are not easy or right answers.

00:11:57.850 --> 00:12:04.240 position:72%
Primary sources present multiple perspectives,
helping students recognize the complexity

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:08.060 position:66%
of issues and to understand the importance
of context for credible interpretation.

00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:13.360 position:56%
Because primary sources represent
authentic voices and points of view,

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:15.210
students are better able to connect

00:12:15.210 --> 00:12:19.870 position:58%
with the content not only
intellectually, but also emotionally.

00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:24.820 position:70%
That personal connection inherently makes
the content more engaging and more memorable,

00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:28.240
leading students to develop
enduring understanding.

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:30.620 position:61%
Where there are certainly pros and
cons for our new [inaudible] standards,

00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:33.770
when I first entered common
into our readings standards,

00:12:33.770 --> 00:12:37.700
I immediately recognized the
processes of historian uses.

00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:40.430
Tell us your views of the
ELA common core standards.

00:12:40.430 --> 00:12:43.820 position:72%
How have the standards impacted your teaching?

00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:47.700 position:70%
So you're not common core in Virginia, Patty.

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:50.800
But are you familiar with
the common core standards?

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:54.800
If not, we'll certainly give
you a taste of that tonight

00:12:54.800 --> 00:13:02.310
and show you how common core really
aligns to primary source analysis.

00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:09.150 position:72%
So one of the things the CCSS represented a
shift from content to process-based standards.

00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:13.030 position:59%
So there is definitely a lot of
synergy between the literacy standards

00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:16.980
and teaching with primary sources.

00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:22.510 position:70%
So, David talks about being more intentional,
about claims evidence and justification.

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:25.130
[Inaudible] is just starting.

00:13:25.130 --> 00:13:31.420 position:63%
Teresa talks about an approach and
writing objective based on the standard.

00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:36.640 position:69%
And then Andy talks about the standards and
inclusion of literacy across the curriculum.

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:42.230
I totally agree, Angie, I think
that is really a definite positive.

00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:48.380 position:64%
Lashaun is talking about making them more
deeper with the content and information.

00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:53.850 position:75%
Right. And images, especially, like the activity
we just did, are fantastic for helping students

00:13:53.850 --> 00:13:58.670
to learn the processes outlined
in the CCSS literacy standards.

00:13:58.670 --> 00:14:02.510 position:63%
The primary source image analysis allows
students to focus on the acquisition

00:14:02.510 --> 00:14:06.890 position:63%
of these skills without the additional
cognitive load of reading comprehension.

00:14:06.890 --> 00:14:12.870
So again, we're talking about how
we go from content to process.

00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:16.440 position:69%
It's really a process of historical inquiry.

00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:23.390 position:70%
And something that's important to remember is
that text can be any type of primary source.

00:14:23.390 --> 00:14:27.920
When we say text, we don't
mean just actual text.

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:29.310
They can be images.

00:14:29.310 --> 00:14:34.310 position:69%
So let's break down a chart we created back
in 2012 to show just how closely the process

00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:38.780
within its analysis mirrors the
ten CCSS reading anchor standards.

00:14:38.780 --> 00:14:42.160
The standards text is on the
left as you look at the screen.

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:47.290 position:58%
And the text on the right corresponds
to the process of image analysis.

00:14:47.290 --> 00:14:49.980
Take a look at the words and
phrases underlined in red.

00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:54.820
As you can see, completing an
image analysis as we did earlier,

00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:59.180 position:63%
aligns very well to anchor standard one.

00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:06.780 position:59%
We were analyzing the image, looking
at it to cite specific visual evidence

00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:09.270 position:67%
and using those to support our conclusions.

00:15:09.270 --> 00:15:13.690 position:64%
So there are really so many opportunities

00:15:13.690 --> 00:15:17.130 position:56%
to extend inquiry-based learning
while meeting the literacy standards

00:15:17.130 --> 00:15:19.370 position:59%
of primary source analysis activities.

00:15:19.370 --> 00:15:20.950 position:59%
So let's go on to anchor standard two.

00:15:20.950 --> 00:15:26.970
For this standard you may have
students tell a story of an image

00:15:26.970 --> 00:15:30.880 position:63%
or explain the theme that it represents.

00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:35.180 position:69%
When you want to connect to anchor standard
three, you may have students work with a set

00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:40.070 position:59%
of related images to understand how
an event unfolds or a person develops.

00:15:40.070 --> 00:15:44.720 position:58%
Many students, and even adults, think
a photograph represents the truth.

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:49.640 position:73%
But when we consider what might be happening
outside the frame or what happened right before

00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:54.800 position:66%
or after this moment in time, like some of
you noticed in our image and our analysis,

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:59.110 position:64%
we learn that picture creators make
specific choices that help shape the tone

00:15:59.110 --> 00:16:01.200 position:67%
and the meaning we take away from an image.

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:05.830 position:69%
Something that I think is really
especially important in today's day and age.

00:16:05.830 --> 00:16:12.000 position:69%
Asking students to consider how image
details relate to one another or to an image

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.920
as a whole is a similar process
to use in reading comprehension.

00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:21.680 position:64%
So this is a great opportunity for
students to practice key literacy skills.

00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:28.270 position:72%
Again, right where we're focusing on a process
here when we use an image and not worrying

00:16:28.270 --> 00:16:34.280 position:75%
about adding reading comprehension into the mix.

00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:39.560 position:73%
For anchor standard six, we can have students
to think about the point of view of the creator

00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:43.090 position:73%
and the creator's purpose in creating an image.

00:16:43.090 --> 00:16:50.410 position:66%
These are key historic inquiry skills, as
well as vital information literacy skills.

00:16:50.410 --> 00:16:53.050
I think that is one of the,
just the absolute benefit

00:16:53.050 --> 00:17:01.750 position:73%
of primary sources is really always considering
what are we trying to tell the audience

00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:04.060
with this piece, with this source.

00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:08.120
So anchor standard seven seeks to
ensure that students interact with

00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:11.090 position:56%
and evaluate diverse content format.

00:17:11.090 --> 00:17:15.230
So primary sources certainly
represent the diverse media.

00:17:15.230 --> 00:17:19.500 position:61%
For images, the point of view presented
is much like a textual argument.

00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:24.370 position:66%
All sources are biased, so it is
important to learn to evaluate the details

00:17:24.370 --> 00:17:29.580 position:56%
that support the particular point of
view presented in a text or image.

00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:36.410 position:70%
Sometimes I think there is that misconception
that primary sources are not biased.

00:17:36.410 --> 00:17:37.790
But, of course, they are.

00:17:37.790 --> 00:17:42.070
They're definitely representing
a particular point of view.

00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:49.050 position:73%
So we just need to make sure that we're looking
to try to determine what that point of view is.

00:17:49.050 --> 00:17:55.760 position:63%
Having students compare primary sources,
particularly different types of sources,

00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:58.270
allows you to check into
different learning modalities,

00:17:58.270 --> 00:18:01.420 position:58%
which can lead to amazing connections
and enduring understandings.

00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:06.040 position:61%
And the final standard asks that
students become proficient in analyzing

00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:11.610 position:75%
and understanding different types of complex
text, which primary sources certainly represent.

00:18:11.610 --> 00:18:18.770 position:70%
They really run the gamut from something
that's pretty easy to understand to something

00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:24.600
that really has multiple levels and
take quite some effort to unpack.

00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:30.310 position:69%
So, for information and advice on
selecting primary sources for the classroom,

00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:33.720
as well as excerpting and
modifying primary sources,

00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:39.690
visit the TPS-Barat primary source
nexus teaching resource blog.

00:18:39.690 --> 00:18:40.660
Let's take a quick look.

00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:44.900 position:73%
As a consortium member in the Library of
Congress teaching with primary sources program,

00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:51.090 position:72%
TPS-Barat started this blog in 2011 to support
the program mission to foster knowledge

00:18:51.090 --> 00:18:54.480 position:58%
and use of teaching with primary
sources from the Library of Congress.

00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:58.860 position:69%
In that time, we've posted a lot of content.

00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:04.060 position:63%
From curated sets of primary sources and
other resources from the online library

00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:08.470
to primary source teaching
strategies, lessons and activities.

00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:14.550 position:58%
Right now, with the start of National
History Day, we also have a lot

00:19:14.550 --> 00:19:20.420
of resources linked to topic ideas.

00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:26.280 position:73%
Because the CCSS process aligns so well to
primary source analysis, you will find that all

00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:31.070
of our instructional content aligns
to the standards to some extent.

00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:35.960 position:63%
Additionally, on loc.gov, under the
teachers section, you will find a wealth

00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:40.390
of classroom material aligned
to the common core.

00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:46.580 position:61%
Let's take a closer look at the college
career and civic life for C3 framework

00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:53.160 position:75%
for social studies which was meant to help guide
the formation of state social science standards

00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:57.100
but can also help teachers to
better define instructional goals

00:19:57.100 --> 00:20:00.320
and devise implementation plans.

00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:04.890 position:67%
&gt;&gt; Julie and Mara, we have lost your audio.

00:20:04.890 --> 00:20:07.700
Kathy, I'm going to propose
that I at least walk us

00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:11.580
through the slides, just
in the interest of time.

00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:14.900
And we'll trust that you'll
work behind the scenes

00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:19.150
to get the actual presenters
up and running for this.

00:20:19.150 --> 00:20:22.610
And we'll loop back and hit,
make sure we hit all the points.

00:20:22.610 --> 00:20:25.670
So again, This is Cheryl Lederle
from the Library of Congress.

00:20:25.670 --> 00:20:30.240 position:61%
I'm going to be talking a bit through
these slides while Kathy, my colleague,

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:32.390
tries to get others up and running.

00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:39.220 position:69%
And I do hope they interrupt me very soon
with, and get the technical issues resolved.

00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:44.680 position:64%
So, they have noted that teaching with
primary sources supports the C3 framework

00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:48.890 position:63%
for social studies, which I noticed that
some of you are working with and some

00:20:48.890 --> 00:20:53.080
of you are less aware of, and
some of you are just starting.

00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:56.070 position:66%
The four dimensions follow an inquiry arc.

00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:58.190
There are four content areas.

00:20:58.190 --> 00:21:02.520 position:61%
And in building the C3 framework, there
was great attention paid to aligning

00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:05.280
to the common core state standards.

00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:10.920 position:59%
The C3 framework has interdisciplinary
applications and points toward

00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:18.280 position:64%
and during understandings and preparation
for democratic decision-making.

00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:21.460
And Anne notes that the democratic
decision-making is

00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:24.210 position:56%
so important for the social studies.

00:21:24.210 --> 00:21:27.750
And I think we're aware of
that in an election season.

00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:36.920 position:67%
Here's a graphic of the four dimensions and
how they align to parts of the inquiry arc.

00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:41.060
There's a focus on developing
questions and planning inquiries.

00:21:41.060 --> 00:21:44.950
Perhaps a little bit familiar
from the earlier looking.

00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:46.450
Do I hear sound?

00:21:46.450 --> 00:21:47.270
&gt;&gt; Can you hear me?

00:21:47.270 --> 00:21:48.150
This is Pam.

00:21:48.150 --> 00:21:48.950
&gt;&gt; Hi Pam.

00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:49.790
This is Cheryl.

00:21:49.790 --> 00:21:54.300
I'm going to mute myself and
let you take over from here.

00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:56.600 position:59%
Thank you everybody for being patient.

00:21:56.600 --> 00:22:01.760 position:70%
&gt;&gt; We're going to talk a little bit about how
the four dimensions of the C3 work together.

00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:07.620
You start by developing questions
and move on to investigate concepts

00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:12.690 position:58%
in core disciplines Then you evaluate
your sources and use them as evidence

00:22:12.690 --> 00:22:18.170 position:59%
to form the conclusions that you
communicate in an effort to illuminate

00:22:18.170 --> 00:22:21.860
and act on your ideas and issues.

00:22:21.860 --> 00:22:24.870 position:64%
Dimension one is pretty self-explanatory.

00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:30.110
But the framework makes it clear
that students need to be a part

00:22:30.110 --> 00:22:33.710 position:56%
of the question formulation process.

00:22:33.710 --> 00:22:36.440 position:66%
Through continued primary source learning,

00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:40.910 position:59%
you'll see that students automatically
get better at asking questions.

00:22:40.910 --> 00:22:46.120 position:61%
They develop hypotheses, make
connections and incorporate reflections

00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:49.840 position:58%
of prior learning into new inquiries.

00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:55.750 position:73%
To learn more about simulating student question
skills, check out questions are the engines

00:22:55.750 --> 00:22:59.230
of intellect tomorrow at this time.

00:22:59.230 --> 00:23:04.910
The C3 framework doesn't
prescribe to specific content.

00:23:04.910 --> 00:23:08.600
And Theodore was asking about
content as opposed to process.

00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:14.610 position:64%
But there are target concepts and skills
practice within the four main disciplines

00:23:14.610 --> 00:23:20.720
of dimension two, which are civics,
economics, geography and history.

00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:26.510 position:56%
But remember, these disciplines are
not meant to be taught in isolation.

00:23:26.510 --> 00:23:31.250 position:59%
Primary source learning naturally
provides cross-curricular connections.

00:23:31.250 --> 00:23:39.910 position:72%
And there are resources for teaching these
disciplines on the library's website, loc.gov.

00:23:39.910 --> 00:23:45.400 position:56%
We also have information on the
TPS-Barat primary source nexus site.

00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:49.480
There are currently more
than 50 lessons and more

00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:53.970
than 200 guided primary source
analysis activities targeted

00:23:53.970 --> 00:23:57.500 position:75%
for elementary, middle and high school students.

00:23:57.500 --> 00:24:01.160
And they feature all kinds
of primary source types.

00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:04.390
Okay, dimension three and four.

00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:09.220
The analysis of primary sources is
at the heart of dimension three.

00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:15.080
This connects both the research
and the verified basis of inquiry.

00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:20.580 position:63%
The communicate phase of the inquiry arc
is also carried out in dimension four.

00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:25.410 position:56%
Students take action because
learning is areflexic and recursive,

00:24:25.410 --> 00:24:32.770 position:72%
and communicating conclusions can lead to new
ideas to try out and new questions to explore.

00:24:32.770 --> 00:24:37.490
As you can see, the connections
between the C3 framework

00:24:37.490 --> 00:24:42.880 position:70%
and the English language arts literacy
common core state standards are comprehensive

00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:47.340
and touch all areas, reading,
writing, speaking and listening.

00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:52.560 position:59%
So let's think back again to our image
analysis that we did at the beginning.

00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:57.040 position:64%
And let's compare our work to the
dimensions by considering some questions.

00:24:57.040 --> 00:25:02.590
Do we develop questions and
plan for further inquiry?

00:25:02.590 --> 00:25:07.320 position:69%
Which of the subject areas in social studies
might the particular image be analyzed

00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:08.280
pertain to?

00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:10.750
And how did they pertain?

00:25:10.750 --> 00:25:16.670 position:69%
And remember again, the four disciplines are
civics, economics, geography and history.

00:25:16.670 --> 00:25:23.210
Now we found the source for
you, but who evaluated it?

00:25:23.210 --> 00:25:25.030
You evaluated it, right.

00:25:25.030 --> 00:25:32.110 position:70%
And based on your reflections and inferences,
were you able to develop any claims yourself?

00:25:32.110 --> 00:25:37.930 position:58%
How might the image analysis activity
help you to communicate conclusions?

00:25:37.930 --> 00:25:41.910
What actions might you take to
extend your newfound understanding?

00:25:41.910 --> 00:25:46.540
So this is a quote from the
Guardians of Democracy report.

00:25:46.540 --> 00:25:50.750
We also firmly believe that an
educated citizenry is essential

00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:53.380 position:70%
to the practice of representative government.

00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:57.360
So today, when civics instruction
is taught at all,

00:25:57.360 --> 00:26:01.490
it's often taught discreetly
as a standalone subject.

00:26:01.490 --> 00:26:04.950
But while we teach with primary
sources in any subject,

00:26:04.950 --> 00:26:09.160
we help students develop
civic competency skills.

00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:12.150
So just what are these skills?

00:26:12.150 --> 00:26:13.810
Let's take a look.

00:26:13.810 --> 00:26:17.680
Capable citizens think creatively
and critically.

00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:23.210 position:73%
The Library of Congress has long realized that
teaching with primary sources engages students,

00:26:23.210 --> 00:26:28.760 position:67%
fosters inquiry, promote critical thinking,
enables the construction of knowledge,

00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:33.090 position:66%
and stimulates innovative problem-solving.

00:26:33.090 --> 00:26:35.540 position:66%
Capable citizens are information literate.

00:26:35.540 --> 00:26:37.780
But what does that mean?

00:26:37.780 --> 00:26:41.720 position:61%
Multiple universities have defined the
information literate student as someone

00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:47.330
who can determine what information
they need and figure out how

00:26:47.330 --> 00:26:49.840 position:61%
to find it effectively and efficiently.

00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:55.620 position:70%
They can evaluate the reliability and the
relevance of their information and connect it

00:26:55.620 --> 00:26:58.380
to other information and knowledge.

00:26:58.380 --> 00:27:03.650 position:56%
And they use information effectively
to accomplish a specific purpose.

00:27:03.650 --> 00:27:07.570 position:63%
These are all skills that are reinforced
through primary source learning.

00:27:07.570 --> 00:27:11.850
Let's take a look at how
six of Unesco's 11 stages

00:27:11.850 --> 00:27:16.340 position:58%
of information literacy are
supported by primary source learning.

00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:20.360
With primary sources, information
is not spoon-fed to students.

00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:26.150 position:56%
Instead, they need to actively look
for and find information themselves.

00:27:26.150 --> 00:27:31.140 position:66%
When students analyze and evaluate primary
sources, they're creating new knowledge

00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:35.070
and making sense of that
knowledge, thinking critically.

00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:39.600 position:64%
And learning how to analyze and interpret
primary sources provides students

00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:46.600 position:73%
with the opportunity to evaluate a variety of
communication formats and styles and helps them

00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:51.970 position:67%
to hone their verbal and written
communication skills for specific purposes.

00:27:51.970 --> 00:27:55.300 position:63%
Capable citizens are good communicators.

00:27:55.300 --> 00:28:02.580 position:75%
Here's a tweet shared last month by a nationally
recognized educator whose former student credits

00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:08.040 position:69%
her success at college to inquiry-based
lessons and learning with primary resources.

00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:12.350 position:64%
The tween contained this note from one of
the student's professors at Vanderbilt.

00:28:12.350 --> 00:28:14.970 position:56%
So take a minute and just scan this.

00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:25.970
What an impact inquiry learning
with primary sources have.

00:28:25.970 --> 00:28:31.770 position:66%
I think we can all agree that this student
was certainly prepared for college.

00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:35.710 position:63%
Capable citizens are good collaborators.

00:28:35.710 --> 00:28:39.960
The analysis and interpretation of
primary sources requires students

00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:46.910 position:61%
to consider multiple perspectives and
is often best completed collaboratively

00:28:46.910 --> 00:28:49.720
to provide students with
different ideas and viewpoints.

00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:56.080 position:61%
And, as you can see in that top left
picture, even young students can engage

00:28:56.080 --> 00:29:00.860
in the inquiry process using the
primary source analysis tool.

00:29:00.860 --> 00:29:05.880 position:56%
Okay. This year the Barat
Education Foundation and its partner

00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:10.730 position:63%
in the teaching primary sources program,
Constitutional Rights Foundation,

00:29:10.730 --> 00:29:15.040
will be creating some exciting new
cross-curricular civics lessons

00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:18.030
that incorporate primary
sources from the library.

00:29:18.030 --> 00:29:24.270 position:69%
In the meantime, please continue to look
for primary source sets, teaching strategies

00:29:24.270 --> 00:29:31.110 position:75%
and learning activities on the TPS-Barat primary
source nexus and be sure to follow us on Twitter

00:29:31.110 --> 00:29:38.400
at PSNTPS to keep tabs on the
latest resources and learning.

00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:44.070 position:61%
And remember, when you teach with
primary sources, no matter the subject,

00:29:44.070 --> 00:29:49.430 position:73%
you are implementing inquiry-based learning
that aligns to the common core state standards,

00:29:49.430 --> 00:29:53.410
supports the C3 framework,
and fosters civic literacy.

00:29:53.410 --> 00:30:02.640 position:73%
And our last slide is a slide with links to
all the resources that you can reference later.

00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:03.210
&gt;&gt; Alright.

00:30:03.210 --> 00:30:06.420 position:64%
So well I want to thank our participants.

00:30:06.420 --> 00:30:12.660
And I want to thank especially our
presenters today, Mara, Julie, Pam,

00:30:12.660 --> 00:30:18.000 position:67%
I know that we had some technical glitches,
but I want to thank you for a level

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:21.060 position:63%
of professionalism that is just amazing.

00:30:21.060 --> 00:30:24.810 position:75%
So I thank you for your time and your expertise.

00:30:24.810 --> 00:30:30.590
And if you have any more questions,
you can continue them on Twitter.

00:30:30.590 --> 00:30:33.760 position:59%
Thank you everyone, and we hope to see
you at more sessions tomorrow night.
