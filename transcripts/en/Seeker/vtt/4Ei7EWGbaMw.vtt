00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:02.180
Does size really matter?

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:03.180
Evolution says it might.

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.020
Hello, men and women of Earth.

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:11.700
Trace here,
reporting for D News.

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.580
A new study was released today
that shows and grows the belief

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:18.380
that size does matter,
evolutionarily speaking.

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:19.150
But does it?

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.680
Of all primates, humans
have the largest penis,

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:23.930
gorillas have the smallest.

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.380
And science wondered
why that would be.

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:27.550
Now, we have an idea.

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:31.180
The ladies pick their mates
prior to having sex with them.

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.790
The researchers showed women
computer animated male figures

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.920
accounting for traits
normally associated

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.620
with male attractiveness,
like height and shoulder

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:41.660
to hip ratio.

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.520
But they added in
flaccid penis size.

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.270
Everyone finds taller
men more attractive.

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:47.720
It's just generally accepted.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.470
But when paired with the ideal
body ratio and a larger penis

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.980
size, attractiveness increased.

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.820
In a nutshell, the results
found that flaccid penis size

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.620
did affect levels of
attraction for women.

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.390
Taller dudes with
larger flaccid penises

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:03.840
were considered more attractive.

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.710
The scientists
wanted to know, why

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.810
are our penises larger
relative to the size

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.630
than other primates,
and if females

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.950
can affect the evolution of
the male member in a species.

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.360
Yes, in a nutshell.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.740
Female sexual
selection can influence

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.510
the size of a phallus over time.

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:20.260
Girl power.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.240
Simply put, before we
started wearing clothes

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.360
170,000 years ago, the
females of our species

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.440
would mate with males who
had larger flaccid penises.

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.550
As the selection
continued, generation

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:33.450
over generation, human
penises gradually got larger.

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.900
It seems like a win-win to me.

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.610
Guys, this is important.

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.120
Flaccid penises range in size.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.292
And if you're really concerned
about the size of your member,

00:01:41.292 --> 00:01:43.250
you're probably thinking
of it when it's erect.

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.990
The average erect penis
is around 5 1/2 inches,

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.955
perhaps because of evolution
cultivated a phallus that best

00:01:48.955 --> 00:01:52.240
fit with the size of the vagina,
which is about four inches.

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.980
But this study only tested
flaccid penises, not

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:55.600
erect ones.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.130
The Kinsey Institute points
out that the averages

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.390
for flaccid penises are
like one to four inches,

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.490
whereas erect is
between five and seven,

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.380
the smaller flaccid
penises increasing

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.580
in size way more
than the larger.

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.240
Why should we evolutionarily
look for size to matter?

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.570
A study published in The
Journal of Sexual Medicine

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:14.430
indicates that women report
having more frequent orgasms

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:15.290
with larger penises.

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.390
But the obsession
over size shrinks

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.330
when you look at a
myriad of studies

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.530
that show the best predictor
of sexual satisfaction

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.110
is enjoying the company
of the person attached

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.730
to the penis, not the actual
penis attached to the person.

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.690
In worthwhile relationships
and attachments,

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.600
confidence and attraction wins
over big dongs every time.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.187
For me, the study seems to
miss the idea surrounding

00:02:36.187 --> 00:02:38.520
forcible mate selection in
the history of our evolution.

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.690
Were females hundreds of
thousands of years ago free

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:42.982
to select mates as they wished?

00:02:42.982 --> 00:02:44.856
This might be a little
over sharing for some,

00:02:44.856 --> 00:02:46.140
but does size matter to you?

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.989
What's the big deal?

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:48.530
