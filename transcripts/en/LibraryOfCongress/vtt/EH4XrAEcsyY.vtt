00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:04.680
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.840
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Good
evening everybody.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.590
I'm very pleased to
see you all here.

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:24.560
My name David Plylar and
I'm a music specialist here

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.740
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.260
And I'm just going to
speak to you a little bit

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.090
about the program that
we have tonight.

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:36.370
And maybe just to show you
a few little insights into--

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.180
in particular, into one of the
holdings of the management holdings

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.810
that we have at the Library which
is the first manuscript version

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.510
of Brahms Handel variations,
the Variations

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.010
and Fugue on a Theme by Handel.

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:56.100
So, I have some images of that up
later towards the end of the talk.

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.830
So, firstly, there's something in
common with each of these pieces,

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:05.010
well, most of the pieces
that you're going to hear

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.790
in tonight's performance.

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.740
They all heavily draw on
the tradition of fugue,

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.620
one by one of the, you know,
the person that we always think

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.910
of with the fugue and we
associate with the fugue, JS Bach.

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:21.910
And then others who kind of
followed in that footstep--

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:29.960
in his footsteps so with essays in
the genre that are kind of battling

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.620
with the same sorts of issues
that Bach was dealing with in his

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.690
but then, taking them
in different directions.

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:42.220
So, I thought we would start by
just talking a little bit about--

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:48.570
if I can get this correct--
the fugal system.

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:55.230
There are lots of politics
in music especially the types

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:56.530
of words that we use.

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.810
We talk about mastery of form
and wanting to master the fugue.

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.820
And fugues have often have
this sort of academic,

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:10.390
like the highest aspiration for
composers that they want to able

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.900
to compose a fugue well, and
they want to be the masters

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:23.050 position:56%
of the subject with all the answers,
showing off at an exposition,

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.680
in their exposition, swiftly
dealing with any episodes of kind

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:33.780
of unruly musical characters,
and often finding different ways

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.890
to augment their reputation
especially

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.370
by start doing their stuff
towards the end of the fugue.

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.450
So, I apologize.

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.000
You're going to be
in for tonight but.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.420
But how does one manage
this and how does one strive

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.050
to master these types
of things historically?

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.050
Those are questions that we
might just hint at tonight

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:58.510 position:56%
but we're not going to try to tackle

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.920
because they're very
large types of questions.

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:10.110
So, in the feudal system-- fugal
system, I'm sorry, you know,

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.850
many people, their eyes glaze
over when you start to get

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:17.480
into the details of
fugal structures and--

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.560 position:56%
so, we're not going to do that here.

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.220
So instead, we're going
to look specifically

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:24.950
at where fugues have trod.

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.940
Like what types of
things are we talking

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.010
about when we speak of a fugue?

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:38.600
Is it the structure of a fugue
that gives its identity as a fugue

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.150
or is there rather a
collection of traits

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:48.510
or is it some combination
of these things?

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.610
[ Laughter ]

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:57.780
There is no real perfect
example of what a fugue is.

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.790
Often, it's described as having an
exposition and having other sorts

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:05.080
of development of qualities
going through episodes

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:09.820 position:56%
and then coming back to some sort
of summation and a sort of a return,

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:13.910
in a way that's somewhat
similar to a sonata.

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:18.680
But, what I would rather
focus on as a listener,

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.800
especially if you're a listener
who's hearing a particular fugue

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:25.280
for the first time is how is
it that we tend to approach it?

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.090
And there's lots of
different ways and different--

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:30.520
everybody has a different
approach to it.

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:36.290
But it's basically-- it's
dependent on the material

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:40.390 position:56%
that a composer is using, the actual
composer, the particular traits

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:44.540
of that composer, and the time on
which the composer is writing in.

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:49.490
Another factor that we're
going to look at in particular

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:53.320
with the fugues that we're going
to hear today is their location

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.930
with respect to the rest of
the music in the program.

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:00.170 position:56%
They have basically a locus ultimus.

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:03.590
They're the last thing
that you hear in each work.

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:07.100
And I'm talking about the
preludes and fugues in Bach

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:09.760
from the first book of
"Well-Tempered Clavier."

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.730
It's not fugues and preludes,
it's preludes and fugues.

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:15.560
So, they're kind of these pairs
where the fugue is the point

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.130
where you're going towards.

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:19.910
And then in the Beethoven,
the fugue comes

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:22.970
at the end with some modifications.

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:27.140
And the same with the Brahms,
the fugue comes at the end.

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:29.850
But all of them exhibit
certain traits that tend to come

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:34.380
through quite clearly and these
deal with issues of variation

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:35.680
that we find in other types

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:39.910
of [inaudible] strategies
in non-fugue works.

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:44.280
One thing that I do notice
when I'm listening to a fugue

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:47.280 position:56%
and I'm just thinking in the
abstract here, that I think in terms

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:49.730
of voices, like usually
there's a presentation

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:52.040
of a single idea that I listen to.

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:54.720
And then I think of them
in terms of layering.

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.390
I may not know at what pitch
level is going to come in next

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:00.910 position:56%
or something like that, I might
have an idea, but I'll get the sense

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:04.270
that it's another voice
that's being layered onto it.

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:08.260
I also get a sense that there's
a limited number of ingredients

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.530
that are going into the
mix that are contributing

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:14.180
to this musical composition
that I'm hearing.

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:17.180
But generally, this is the case,
not always the case especially

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:20.050
in very complicate fugues.

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:30.210
So, if there is no single real
definition or defining fugue type

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:33.350
that we can look at, what
do we get when we have--

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:36.730 position:56%
what can we do about this smaller
versions of fugues that tend to come

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:40.130
up such as the fugato
and the fughetta.

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:46.730
There's not much that we can
do except to say-- I'm sorry--

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:52.830
that there are attempts to
describe the process of the types

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:57.660 position:56%
of imitation and things that
composers employ at specific moments

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:03.460
to emulate a strict contrapuntal
style or maybe not so strict,

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:07.140
just depending on these types of
ingredients that they might use

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:09.360
that we might recognize
in a fughetta passage.

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:13.850
It might be in versions,
stretching the themes out a bit

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:17.280
through what's called augmentation,
contracting them a bit,

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:20.530
through diminution, all these
different types of things

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:23.030
that we can still somehow
identify it either

00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:27.600
as more typically significant
or having the similar sort

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:35.430
of overarching form to it, shape
to the phrase, shape to the motive.

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:38.940
Still assuming like it's
very much a part of it.

00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:43.160
But specifically looking
at tonight's and we won't--

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:44.910
don't worry, we won't be
spending a ton of time

00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:47.140
with keys and stuff like that.

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:51.550
But there is-- the way that the
program is constructed is really

00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:58.530
nice, I think, and
augmentatious, as I put it.

00:07:58.530 --> 00:08:03.640
We have what is essentially
a kind of one way

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:07.300
of putting these different
preludes and fugues in order

00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:10.760
that is not the way that you see
it in the "Well-Tempered Clavier."

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:15.320 position:56%
So, when Bach first was putting
these together and did the fair copy

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:19.960
in the 1722, the way
that it was ordered

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:21.810
in terms of keys is progressive.

00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:24.910
That is, it gets start with
C and then we move to--

00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:29.750
we move up chromatically
until we get to B. It's a--

00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:33.090
It's not maybe the way that you
would encounter it in performance

00:08:33.090 --> 00:08:35.930
and in fact, you probably
would not have encountered it

00:08:35.930 --> 00:08:39.010 position:56%
as an entire block in a performance.

00:08:39.010 --> 00:08:42.720
So, oftentimes, what is--
pianists have their opportunity

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:45.890
or keyboardists I should say
have the opportunity to put them

00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:49.740
in particular orders that make
sense, and this one does to me.

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:52.320
And we'll listen a little bit

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:56.600
to hear why it might
make sense as well.

00:08:56.600 --> 00:09:00.410
So, in this case, we start with
A-flat major and then if we go

00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:02.920
down a fifth-- I'm
calling it a fifth--

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:04.510
that would give us D-flat major.

00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:07.550
But then, we'll give it the minor,
well, so, say, D-flat minor.

00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:10.990
And then, we'll enharmonically
change that to C-sharp minor.

00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:14.220 position:56%
So, it kind of works out as a fifth.

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:16.860
And then if we go down, if you
give me that, we go down a fifth

00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:23.820
from there to F-sharp major, and
then if we take the relative minor

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:26.580
of that as D-sharp minor
which is the key of the fugue,

00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:30.330
we have the same key
signature for that.

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:34.420
When that ends, it's spelled as
D-sharp major, but it sounds--

00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:38.720
we'll hear it as E-flat major which
then leads directly to A-flat major

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:40.190
which is the key of the Beethoven.

00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:44.140
That sounds complicated
but it sounds very easy

00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:46.800
when you actually just
hear it to the ear.

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:51.380 position:56%
So, I'm wondering just to-- so we'll
get a sense of what this sounds

00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:53.910
like without listening
to very much of them.

00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:59.090
Can we start with disc one,
play the opening of disc two

00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:04.170
and I'll just signal when to change
and it will be skipping by one.

00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:07.820
So I'll-- two.

00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:11.090
Disc one of track two.

00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:13.390
Yeah.

00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:25.720
[ Music ]

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:27.610
OK. Well, the point is made.

00:10:27.610 --> 00:10:29.620
E-flat going to A-flat.

00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:33.000
And a brilliant point
it was, I'm sure.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.890
So, we'll just move right
on to the second half

00:10:36.890 --> 00:10:40.590
which is a slightly different
way of looking at it.

00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:46.960
We have E-flat going to G-minor,
to A-minor, to B-flat, to B-flat.

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:51.830
What's happening here is that
we have another leap of a fifth,

00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:57.350
E-flat to B-flat, relative minor
as the same key signature G-minor,

00:10:57.350 --> 00:11:01.490
and then we're just oxalating
about that kind of B-flat axis

00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:04.310
and then ending on B-flat
because we want to affirm B-flat

00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:08.760
as the key of the evening.

00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:11.980
That was a joke there.

00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:13.510
But, I think we'll
forgo playing this.

00:11:13.510 --> 00:11:16.240
But when you're listening,
just, you know, you'll get--

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:19.230
I believe it's going to be
playing them straight through so

00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:23.490
that you'll start to hear
some of this relationships

00:11:23.490 --> 00:11:25.330
that might be of interest to you.

00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:28.930
At the time when Bach
was writing it, it was--

00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:33.260
we call this the "Well-Tempered
Clavier."

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:35.680
Tuning is not the same as it was--

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:39.320
as it is today and is
continuing to change today.

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:43.740
Lots of people have a lot more to
say about this in greater detail

00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:48.590
than I can, except to
say that back in the day,

00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:51.420
keys had a lot more distinctive
character than they do

00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:53.820
in the cases of equal temperament.

00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:57.710
And so, this was one of the
things that was being explored

00:11:57.710 --> 00:11:59.500
with all these new keys,
especially the ones

00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:05.440 position:56%
that had some strange key signatures
that were not typically seen

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:09.090
for Bach, the "Well-Tempered
Clavier."

00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:16.510
So going back to the A-flat major
prelude, we'll just take a look

00:12:16.510 --> 00:12:22.000
at a couple of things from the
Bach that will kind of stand

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.870
for everything because there's
not enough time to really go

00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:27.680
into detail on all these pieces.

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:32.750
So, we're not looking
at a fugue in this case,

00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:34.870
we're looking at a prelude.

00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:36.500
And this one I think
is a great opener

00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:40.050
because it gives us a very
clear sense of relationships

00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:41.790
that we can hear right away.

00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:45.660
So in this case, I've
labeled X and Y,

00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:47.450
two ideas that are
very much similar.

00:12:47.450 --> 00:12:50.010
They're just transpositions.

00:12:50.010 --> 00:12:52.740
A little bit altered but then
you can follow the rhythms

00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:54.790
as being pretty much the same.

00:12:54.790 --> 00:13:00.870
And then, you can see that the same
basic thing happens with X and Y.

00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:04.180
In fact, the exact same thing
happens in the left hand,

00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:08.180
an octave below as what
we heard in the first.

00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:11.080
So, maybe we can hear
this as track one of that.

00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:12.730
Just the opening.

00:13:12.730 --> 00:13:15.080
[ Music ]

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:20.290
So, you can hear quite clearly that
these are kind of imitative things

00:13:20.290 --> 00:13:25.960
and it's a way to build larger
phrases with these smaller ideas.

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:30.410
This continues in many--
with great--

00:13:30.410 --> 00:13:33.130
Bach continues this
process with great economy.

00:13:33.130 --> 00:13:37.700
And we find that he-- I just
picked out instance among many just

00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:39.740
to demonstrate the point.

00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:46.270
And these are two spots that
are distant from each other

00:13:46.270 --> 00:13:49.140
by about 15 or 16 measures.

00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:52.290
But what you'll notice
is that I've labeled X

00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:55.820
and Y as that same basic idea
that we just listened to.

00:13:55.820 --> 00:14:00.330
We hear it in the base, on the
first, the one that's in the left.

00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:03.690
And then we hear it in
the treble on the right.

00:14:03.690 --> 00:14:06.780
There's also certain
consistencies that you'll find

00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:10.170
between little kind
of many imitations.

00:14:10.170 --> 00:14:15.120
Those are the dashed brackets
that show F to A-flat to F, and G,

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:21.150 position:56%
B-flat, G. You can see that on each,
the upper and the lower is there.

00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:24.870 position:56%
And then-- And the same on the other
one, you can see there's B-flat

00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:29.530
to D-flat to B-flat, and C to
E-flat to C. So these are things

00:14:29.530 --> 00:14:33.520
that you hear them at slightly
different times, but they're kind

00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:37.300
of little many imitative ideas.

00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:41.140 position:56%
And then we have what I'm calling Z,

00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:45.600
which here represents just a little
figure that has a neighbor note.

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:50.980
In this case, the first one
is E-flat to D to E-flat.

00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:55.400 position:56%
That happens to be a small or second
than the one that's F to E-flat

00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:59.560
to F, but it's still just to--
it's rhythmically recognizable

00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:04.140
and the direction in contour
are recognizable to the ear

00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:07.390
without having to label it Z.
You know, that's the Z idea.

00:15:07.390 --> 00:15:10.300
No, that's not the point
of this kind of analysis,

00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:14.060
but it's just a way of
saying that is something

00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:17.900
that gives the piece
consistency or gives--

00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:21.460
makes references that we
can easily understand.

00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:32.260
Time flies though so we've
got to look at the next piece

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:35.680
which is the Beethoven
Opus 110-- I'm sorry.

00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:38.210
We're skipping the rest
of the Bach for now just

00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:40.570
because there will be the eight--

00:15:40.570 --> 00:15:42.800
total of eight pieces in
the preludes and fugues,

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:45.820
the four there are selected.

00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:51.580
Beethoven's Opus 110 A-flat
major sonata was written

00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:53.660
about the time a little
bit concurrently

00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:54.960
with this last piano sonata.

00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:56.430
This is his penultimate sonata.

00:15:56.430 --> 00:16:04.820
It-- Kind of, it's a step
back from-- in terms of--

00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:08.650
it has this air of
simplicity without being simple

00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:12.930
from what he had done
before if we look at say

00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:17.380 position:56%
like the Hammerklavier's Sonata Opus
106 which was just I think a year,

00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:21.670
a year and a half previously
to the A-flat major composed.

00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:27.790
Before we look at briefly at
how he deals with the fugue,

00:16:27.790 --> 00:16:33.650
I just want to point out that at
this point in Beethoven's life,

00:16:33.650 --> 00:16:37.360
regardless of the state
of his hearing,

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:39.780
he still has this exceptional
ability

00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:42.140
to orchestrate at the keyboard.

00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:43.590
And I make the statement
about Beethoven,

00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:44.890
but it may as well be saying it

00:16:44.890 --> 00:16:47.410
about every other composer
on this program.

00:16:47.410 --> 00:16:50.690
It doesn't matter-- When I say
orchestrating at the keyboard,

00:16:50.690 --> 00:16:53.120
I don't mean to say like
these are the trumpets,

00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:56.800
these could be the strings or one
could do that and that's fine.

00:16:56.800 --> 00:17:00.350
But, I mean that they treat
the different registers

00:17:00.350 --> 00:17:03.700
and the different types of
sound that one can achieve

00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:09.550
at a given keyboard instrument in
ways that are totally significant

00:17:09.550 --> 00:17:11.940
and dramatically significant.

00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:18.200
So, I just picked one example among
many where Beethoven does this.

00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:23.370
You can see those little pickup
chords, the little grace notes

00:17:23.370 --> 00:17:28.300 position:56%
that precede B2 or the first measure
there, and then they can kind

00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:30.300
of continue through that
second measure that you see.

00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:35.880
Those have to kind of fill
out the sound in those spots.

00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:38.870
But then, he abandons
them and continues up to

00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:41.610
that top note without any support.

00:17:41.610 --> 00:17:45.630
Now, he might have chosen to do
octaves or something like that.

00:17:45.630 --> 00:17:49.740
But it's not-- for him, it wasn't
just a question of building sound,

00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:52.340
it was building a particular
type of sound.

00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:56.750
And what we end up hearing when
you have just a single pitch

00:17:56.750 --> 00:18:02.890 position:56%
at that greater remove from the
base is a very unique sort of sound.

00:18:02.890 --> 00:18:06.660
So, that's just something to
listen for in these pieces.

00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:09.050
It's just the way that they--

00:18:09.050 --> 00:18:11.830
these composers treat sound
is a very thoughtful one.

00:18:11.830 --> 00:18:14.500
Of course, we know that with
Bach especially with Brahms,

00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:16.710
but at the same time,
it's worth pointing

00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:18.820
out because those are
the kinds of details

00:18:18.820 --> 00:18:22.940
that really give life
to the music I think.

00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:31.210
When we look at the
fugue, it comes into play

00:18:31.210 --> 00:18:34.870 position:56%
in an interesting way in the sonata.

00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:40.180
Ostensibly, the work is on three
movements in terms of what you see

00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:45.870
on the page but really, it's
divided into many further.

00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:49.910
Well, it may not further but some,
it depends on how you parse it.

00:18:49.910 --> 00:18:51.790
So, you have the first movement

00:18:51.790 --> 00:18:54.370
and then you have this
characteristic of second movement.

00:18:54.370 --> 00:18:59.040
And then you have this like
adagio and recitative kind

00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:03.470
of vocal quality type of
improvisatory passage that leads

00:19:03.470 --> 00:19:10.000
to this very beautiful arioso,
theme kind of a lugubrious kind

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.710
of passage in a whole section.

00:19:12.710 --> 00:19:17.000 position:56%
And this section leads directly to
the first presentation of the fugue.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.270
And he marks it Fuga.

00:19:20.270 --> 00:19:23.510
Maybe we can play--
this is track 11.

00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:29.040
[ Music ]

00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:34.300 position:56%
So, I wanted you to hear that
transition that leads into it first.

00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:36.200
That's the end of the arioso.

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:40.080 position:56%
We didn't have time to hear the
full thing but we will a little bit.

00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:46.780
And now, compare that
with this really, I think,

00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:50.760
just a kind of a magical
but simple moment that leads

00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:53.280
to the return of the fugue.

00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:54.820
But this time, it's in version.

00:19:54.820 --> 00:19:58.510
He even labels it such
so that we don't miss it.

00:19:58.510 --> 00:20:06.040
[ Music ]

00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:09.070
I wanted to let that
play on just a little bit

00:20:09.070 --> 00:20:13.860
so that you could hear how little
tiny ideas start to get parsed

00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:17.800
and then get reinvented and
turned into something else.

00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:20.400
They're-- Which is a very
a bit of anything to do

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:22.890
but it's also a very
fugal thing to do.

00:20:22.890 --> 00:20:26.980
It's part of what this is about.

00:20:28.780 --> 00:20:33.530
Building something out of
something that's recognizable

00:20:33.530 --> 00:20:38.280
but can have many different
types of utility.

00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:45.010
What's, of course, the most
obvious difference about this

00:20:45.010 --> 00:20:46.550
versus say though, the Bach fugues

00:20:46.550 --> 00:20:49.690
that you'll hear preceding
the Beethoven is the way

00:20:49.690 --> 00:20:53.310
that it's split now
into, at the easiest way

00:20:53.310 --> 00:20:55.010
of looking at, four
different sections.

00:20:55.010 --> 00:21:00.870
So we have the arioso then we have
initial presentation of the fugue.

00:21:00.870 --> 00:21:06.390
Then we have a return to the arioso
and a much more impassioned form.

00:21:06.390 --> 00:21:10.590
And then a return to the fugue
with the, in this case, inverted.

00:21:10.590 --> 00:21:14.360
And then, some people think
that it's-- you might call it,

00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:16.280
at the very end, a different
thing because it moves

00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:20.320
out of fugal textures but it's
still basically the summation

00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:22.380
and there's an arch to it.

00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:25.730
And that's going to be important

00:21:25.730 --> 00:21:31.270 position:56%
with Brahms too is understanding
this arch that people are going for.

00:21:31.270 --> 00:21:35.560 position:56%
So it becomes less about just making
some sort of academic statement

00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:38.850
as it is about making some
sort of a musical journey

00:21:38.850 --> 00:21:42.190
in helping the listener
to appreciate it.

00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:48.810
So, moving ahead, 40 or so years,
we get to the-- I'm sorry--

00:21:48.810 --> 00:21:51.960
we get to the opening of the
Brahms Handel variations.

00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:55.370
This manuscript dates from 1861.

00:21:55.370 --> 00:21:59.420 position:56%
And at this point, it's not
exactly named in a way that we know.

00:21:59.420 --> 00:22:03.070
It's just the Variations and
Fugue on a Theme by Handel.

00:22:03.070 --> 00:22:09.580
Instead, it says Variationen
für eine liebe Freundin.

00:22:09.580 --> 00:22:13.450
So, this is for Clara Schumann.

00:22:13.450 --> 00:22:16.310
Yeah. I'm sorry.

00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:22.300
Yeah. So the-- who had--
who performed it and--

00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:26.720
but not exactly up to Brahms
level of expectations.

00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:30.670
Brahms also played this for
her but Clara had to do it

00:22:30.670 --> 00:22:33.250
in difficult circumstances
where she had a limited amount

00:22:33.250 --> 00:22:35.090
of time to actually perform.

00:22:35.090 --> 00:22:37.330
I think she did both of
the piano quartets as well,

00:22:37.330 --> 00:22:41.750
but definitely Opus 25 which comes
right after the set of Opus 24.

00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:45.040
And she learned these pieces
very quickly and, of course,

00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:48.740
eventually did a very good job with
them but it cost this small falling

00:22:48.740 --> 00:22:51.560
out for a brief period of time.

00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:53.040
Brahms at this point is 28.

00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:58.340
So, he's already accomplished a
lot but he's not quite at the level

00:22:58.340 --> 00:23:05.030
where he's got the great kind
of recognition that he wants

00:23:05.030 --> 00:23:07.700
for himself and to-- I don't mean
that in terms of public recognition

00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:09.690
but I mean it in terms of feeling

00:23:09.690 --> 00:23:12.240
that he has complete
command of what he's doing.

00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:18.180
And this is getting back to that
idea of mastering one's art.

00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:23.530
So one way to do that is to kind
of, you know, deal with the past

00:23:23.530 --> 00:23:26.960 position:56%
by encountering the forms and Brahms
does this repeatedly throughout

00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:28.260
his career.

00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:31.450
You know, one of the most famous
examples being the finally movement

00:23:31.450 --> 00:23:35.600
of the fourth symphony where it
takes on a passacaglia and kind

00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:38.820
of creates this great movement
out of it which is, you know,

00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:42.430
it's interesting because it's--
it is an achievement but it's also

00:23:42.430 --> 00:23:44.920
in some ways, it's an
easy way to have some sort

00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:48.170
of basic structure
that you can work with.

00:23:48.170 --> 00:23:51.300
And something similar is happening
with the Handel variations.

00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:55.590
And what I mean by that is that
the theme itself which is an aria

00:23:55.590 --> 00:23:59.450 position:56%
from a sweet, that Handel composing,

00:23:59.450 --> 00:24:03.500
he actually wrote in
the same key B-flat.

00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:06.760
And he composed I think
five variations

00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:10.290 position:56%
on this aria in that original sweet.

00:24:10.290 --> 00:24:16.480
It has the same basic periodic
structure and Brahms maintains

00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:21.570
that almost without exception for
the entire duration of the work.

00:24:21.570 --> 00:24:25.060
So, when we look at it
here, we're just setting

00:24:25.060 --> 00:24:29.450
that Brahms has here just that you
see the theme at the beginning.

00:24:29.450 --> 00:24:31.990
It's basically four
measures repeated.

00:24:31.990 --> 00:24:34.810
And then, a second group
of four measures repeated.

00:24:34.810 --> 00:24:39.590
And it's quite ornamented
but we see right away

00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:43.620
that Brahms embraces
this ornamentation

00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:46.980
in a way that's very different
than the way that Handel did.

00:24:46.980 --> 00:24:52.550
So, if we just look at the
particulars of towards the end

00:24:52.550 --> 00:24:57.020
of Variation One in the Handel
versus the end of Variation One

00:24:57.020 --> 00:24:59.880
in the Brahms, I'm not
meaning to say one is better

00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:01.600
than the other or anything
like that.

00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:04.220
First of all, they're
quite, you know,

00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:06.080
distinct in so many different ways.

00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:09.510
But rather that they treat the
material, you can still see

00:25:09.510 --> 00:25:14.880
that they're kind of engaging in
the same argument but already,

00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:18.410
Brahms is moving quite a bit away
and emphasizing those details

00:25:18.410 --> 00:25:22.920
like the ornamentation and whatnot.

00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:33.330
So, one of the great pleasures of
being able to look at autograph--

00:25:33.330 --> 00:25:37.430
holograph manuscripts by
composers who we can't speak

00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:41.820
to now is we get a
window into their process,

00:25:41.820 --> 00:25:47.140
and this particular piece
offered us a few options.

00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:53.170
I was able to look-- to meet with
Pierre-Laurent Aimard yesterday

00:25:53.170 --> 00:25:57.660
to talk over a number of these
different changes that were made

00:25:57.660 --> 00:26:00.200
to the score, and it was just
a great pleasure to be able

00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:02.470
to look at this in detail.

00:26:02.470 --> 00:26:07.970
Because it's not always just, you
know, once you have a fair copy

00:26:07.970 --> 00:26:12.580
which is what this basically is,
it's pretty much a done piece.

00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:16.180
And so, composers will sometimes
put in different dynamic markings.

00:26:16.180 --> 00:26:19.000
Maybe change a tempo here or there.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:22.020
I think actually on
the previous-- oops--

00:26:22.020 --> 00:26:24.880
in the previous, this first
page, you can see that, you know,

00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:28.280
he has put in a second ending
in pencil at the very end

00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:30.170
on the bottom right
side of the screen.

00:26:30.170 --> 00:26:32.040
You can kind of see that pencil.

00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:35.300
He would do this throughout this
and it's just a way of saying,

00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:37.890
I need to do something
differently to transition

00:26:37.890 --> 00:26:41.420
between movements or
between variations.

00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:43.740
But sometimes, they become
a bit more significant.

00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:45.620
I'm just going to point
out a couple of this.

00:26:45.620 --> 00:26:47.730
But just because I think
it's an interesting thing.

00:26:47.730 --> 00:26:50.610
And I think it's important to
see these as living documents

00:26:50.610 --> 00:26:55.350
and not just, you know, these
notes on the page that I've come

00:26:55.350 --> 00:26:59.320
down from ages past that, you know,
these are things that were workable

00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:01.510
and then, you know, Brahms might
have changed his mind later.

00:27:01.510 --> 00:27:03.870
In fact, he did in certain cases.

00:27:03.870 --> 00:27:09.130
So, at the end of Variation
Eight, at the very top right--

00:27:09.130 --> 00:27:11.110
I don't know if you
can see it too well.

00:27:11.110 --> 00:27:16.250
But what you should see is some
pencilled-in notes underneath

00:27:16.250 --> 00:27:18.250
on the top right.

00:27:18.250 --> 00:27:23.670 position:56%
Basically, those are-- he originally
had just same repeated notes

00:27:23.670 --> 00:27:26.130
in the left-hand, I
keep going on and on.

00:27:26.130 --> 00:27:28.990
But instead, he decides
to have them go

00:27:28.990 --> 00:27:31.150
up an octave and up another octave.

00:27:31.150 --> 00:27:33.090
This is the kind of
orchestrational decision

00:27:33.090 --> 00:27:35.330 position:56%
where it doesn't change the harmony.

00:27:35.330 --> 00:27:37.130
It just doesn't change
that sort of a thing,

00:27:37.130 --> 00:27:41.980
but it does change the affect
and the motion of the piece.

00:27:41.980 --> 00:27:45.060
So that's one example
of a type of change.

00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:51.310
Another major example is
changing the order entirely

00:27:51.310 --> 00:27:53.590
of the variations.

00:27:53.590 --> 00:27:56.650
It's been said of this piece
and other variation sets

00:27:56.650 --> 00:28:00.680 position:56%
that sometimes you can just-- you
could just arbitrarily take them out

00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:05.490
and put them into a different order
and no one would be the wiser.

00:28:05.490 --> 00:28:09.210
And maybe that's true, in
certain cases, each one--

00:28:09.210 --> 00:28:11.030
each variation is sort of an--

00:28:11.030 --> 00:28:15.830
a clear set idea onto itself,
that's absolutely true.

00:28:15.830 --> 00:28:22.720
But there's also this very clear
directionality that is dealt

00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:26.780
within particular ways that
are more or less effective.

00:28:26.780 --> 00:28:28.830
And Brahms sensed this
when he was looking

00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:31.870
at this particular
sequence of variations.

00:28:31.870 --> 00:28:38.070
So, coming out of Variation 14,
you have this very strong movement

00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:41.920
and use of sixth in the right hand
especially, you'll kind of see

00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:46.490
at the top of the page, you'll see
those sixths going back and forth.

00:28:46.490 --> 00:28:51.590
What happens when-- I'm not
sure how practical this will be.

00:28:51.590 --> 00:28:55.670
This will be on these
two by the way.

00:28:55.670 --> 00:29:01.040
What happens is that you start to
get a sort of back and forth thing

00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:05.260
if you're not careful about how you
handle the order of the variations.

00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:08.520
So, the way that Brahms
had it originally--

00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:12.240
We'll just hear a little
bit of that.

00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:13.540
I'm not sure if this will work.

00:29:13.540 --> 00:29:19.510
But starting in track 15,
this would be Variation 14.

00:29:19.510 --> 00:29:24.040
[ Music ]

00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:25.920
I'll come back to that shortly.

00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:27.490
That was just a snippet from each

00:29:27.490 --> 00:29:30.730
of these four variations
in their original order.

00:29:30.730 --> 00:29:33.750
Now, one of the things that
we see, and that's going

00:29:33.750 --> 00:29:36.830
on to the 17th Variation.

00:29:36.830 --> 00:29:41.560
In the new ordering,
Brahms takes advantage

00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:43.570
of what he'd actually
originally written.

00:29:43.570 --> 00:29:46.490
So we have those sixths that I
pointed out just a moment ago.

00:29:46.490 --> 00:29:49.480
This is at the end of Variation 14.

00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:53.620
Then we have this, what I'm
referring to in the title there

00:29:53.620 --> 00:29:56.890
in terms of the hunting which is
basically interval contraction

00:29:56.890 --> 00:29:58.190
and expansion.

00:29:58.190 --> 00:30:01.850
You'll often hear this but because
of the way the horns were tuned,

00:30:01.850 --> 00:30:05.040
where you have as you go
higher, you get closer together.

00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:08.190
And so you might start with
an octave then fifths and,

00:30:08.190 --> 00:30:09.700
you know, getting smaller.

00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:13.450
So we have a third at the top
and then coming back down.

00:30:13.450 --> 00:30:16.670
In this case, you have the
reverse at the end of Variation 14,

00:30:16.670 --> 00:30:17.970
and that's the part I've labeled

00:30:17.970 --> 00:30:21.790
in the second measure interval
contraction and expansion.

00:30:21.790 --> 00:30:27.830
Then, if you go directly
into the new Variation 15,

00:30:27.830 --> 00:30:33.530
you see that you get the tonal
inversion of that material,

00:30:33.530 --> 00:30:34.830
and that's also labeled--

00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:39.220
that's labeled now interval
expansion and then contraction.

00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:43.260
So, you start to have this
actual-- it was already there.

00:30:43.260 --> 00:30:45.950 position:56%
He'd already written the
variations in that particular order,

00:30:45.950 --> 00:30:47.960
but this brings out a
particular relationship

00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:50.860
and especially the thirds and sixth

00:30:50.860 --> 00:30:52.440
which are also inversions
of each other.

00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:55.370
If you have a sixth and you
put this sixth underneath,

00:30:55.370 --> 00:30:58.790
it turns into a third.

00:30:58.790 --> 00:31:00.510
He takes advantage of that in a way

00:31:00.510 --> 00:31:04.780
that makes the variations move
together a bit more smoothly.

00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:12.900
Additionally, it has the
advantage now of ending perfectly

00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:18.090
into Variation 17-- I'm trying
not to get this confused.

00:31:18.090 --> 00:31:21.660
To where-- With the new
end of Variation 16,

00:31:21.660 --> 00:31:25.070
it leads very smoothly
into variation 17.

00:31:25.070 --> 00:31:29.120
So, instead of talking
about that ad nauseum here,

00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:30.550
why don't we just listen to that?

00:31:30.550 --> 00:31:34.200
So this will be starting
from 15 and we'll just listen

00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:37.510
through to the beginning of 18.

00:31:37.510 --> 00:31:40.060
[ Music ]

00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:43.120
So when you hear without
that delayed,

00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:46.880
it does move in smoothly
into that new variation.

00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:49.510
So those types of decisions
are made at various stages

00:31:49.510 --> 00:31:50.870
in the compositional process.

00:31:50.870 --> 00:31:53.750
And these cases are
fairly late stage.

00:31:53.750 --> 00:31:55.810
It's just important to
note and interesting

00:31:55.810 --> 00:32:00.140
to consider what it would have
been like if you hadn't done that.

00:32:00.140 --> 00:32:01.590
I don't think that people
would have thought less

00:32:01.590 --> 00:32:03.040
to the piece to be honest.

00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:06.630
But at the same time, one
has the sense that, yeah,

00:32:06.630 --> 00:32:08.070
that seemed like the right move.

00:32:08.070 --> 00:32:11.550
Sometimes, you find an earlier
version that composers do

00:32:11.550 --> 00:32:15.900
and you think, wow, I wish that he
or she just kept it the way it was

00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:19.090
because that was kind of maybe,
a little bit more effective.

00:32:19.090 --> 00:32:22.770
But, this is kind of one of the
fun things about being able to look

00:32:22.770 --> 00:32:25.070
at these older manuscripts.

00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:32.310
Some of these changes that
composers make don't make it

00:32:32.310 --> 00:32:33.610
into the final version.

00:32:33.610 --> 00:32:36.840
So, it's not always-- you know,
when you look and talk about urtext

00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:40.350
and like this final
word kind of volumes

00:32:40.350 --> 00:32:43.860 position:56%
that people put together these days
which are important in their own way

00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:49.540
for sure, they don't always
embody some very interesting ideas

00:32:49.540 --> 00:32:52.240
that the composer might have
put down at the beginning.

00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:55.910
And this is one that was just
pointed out to me yesterday

00:32:55.910 --> 00:33:00.870
in that talk which is that at the
top here and measure-- I'm sorry--

00:33:00.870 --> 00:33:04.160
at Variation 21, you have--
he wrote in Pizzicato.

00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:08.430
And he's pointing to
the grace notes.

00:33:08.430 --> 00:33:09.730
And why is this important?

00:33:09.730 --> 00:33:11.600
Because it's an orchestrational
detail.

00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:14.220
He doesn't mean you're going to
reach in and pluck the string,

00:33:14.220 --> 00:33:15.570
although that would be impressive.

00:33:15.570 --> 00:33:19.790
And I have to say, I don't dare
any pianists to take that on

00:33:19.790 --> 00:33:23.830
but what's important about
that word with respect

00:33:23.830 --> 00:33:27.310
to the grace notes is that's where
you get the thematic reference.

00:33:27.310 --> 00:33:29.120
The theme is in the grace notes.

00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:32.320
So he's saying, there's a
color choice that you can make

00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:36.310
in the way-- or the way that
you articulate those grace notes

00:33:36.310 --> 00:33:39.400
that would allow it to
sing it in a particular way

00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:42.460
that makes it-- the
theme more clear.

00:33:42.460 --> 00:33:44.890
So, those types of things
are very interesting I think

00:33:44.890 --> 00:33:46.230
to be able to see.

00:33:46.230 --> 00:33:47.950
And then, that's what
we can learn form this

00:33:47.950 --> 00:33:50.880
that you won't find
in a modern edition.

00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:56.700
Sometimes you do as footnotes
but not all the time.

00:33:58.290 --> 00:34:05.010 position:56%
Another case that I think is
worth-taking note of is that the way

00:34:05.010 --> 00:34:09.850 position:56%
that a composer writes especially if
it's handwritten is very evocative

00:34:09.850 --> 00:34:14.230
of what they might be asking
for in the music itself.

00:34:14.230 --> 00:34:15.530
That's not always true.

00:34:15.530 --> 00:34:17.430
There's plenty of passionate
music that looks

00:34:17.430 --> 00:34:20.490
about as stayed as one can have it.

00:34:20.490 --> 00:34:24.780
But there's this passage work
that is leading to the final fugue

00:34:24.780 --> 00:34:30.210
in the Brahms where he-- clearly,
it starts to have this sweep

00:34:30.210 --> 00:34:32.640
to the way that he's writing.

00:34:32.640 --> 00:34:36.370
And you can see this especially
in the Variation 24 at the bottom

00:34:36.370 --> 00:34:40.130
of this page, but also leading
into it from the Variation 23

00:34:40.130 --> 00:34:44.200 position:56%
which is very much the same type of
material, just a slightly different.

00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:50.100
And all I'm referring to really
are just the way that it looks.

00:34:50.100 --> 00:34:53.000
It matches the way that it sounds.

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:55.390
Let me think-- what's
that-- that's going to be--

00:34:55.390 --> 00:34:58.510
Can you play just the
beginning of track 25?

00:34:58.510 --> 00:35:02.660
[ Music ]

00:35:02.660 --> 00:35:06.970
So you get the sense of sweep, the
sense of motion and you see this

00:35:06.970 --> 00:35:09.740
and there's other material
that has a certain similarity

00:35:09.740 --> 00:35:11.660
to this earlier in
the variation set.

00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:13.380
But it's not-- it doesn't
have the same sort

00:35:13.380 --> 00:35:17.480
of handwriting signature
that this does.

00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:19.630
One can read too much
into that, of course.

00:35:19.630 --> 00:35:22.350
You might have been just getting
tired and just ready to be done

00:35:22.350 --> 00:35:24.900
with it because at this point,
it was just copying it out to.

00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:29.220
So it wasn't like in the midst of
the compositional process probably.

00:35:29.220 --> 00:35:32.440
But it is something
that you tend to see

00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:36.100
and it's another interesting
component.

00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:42.120
When we get to the fugue,
there's an interesting kind

00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:45.220
of moment that's reminiscent to me
or Schumann, especially Schumann

00:35:45.220 --> 00:35:48.850
of the Symphonic Etudes,
the 25th Variation here.

00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:52.990
And all I want to point
out about the fugue here,

00:35:52.990 --> 00:35:57.120
because it's a big fugue,
it's a good five minutes or so

00:35:57.120 --> 00:36:03.860 position:56%
and it's a great closer, is that you
start to see again the same types

00:36:03.860 --> 00:36:08.300
of techniques that are being used
by both Bach and Beethoven before.

00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:12.800
Namely, taking a small cellular
idea and then expanding it

00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:17.380
to produce a larger phrase, and
then using those cellular ideas

00:36:17.380 --> 00:36:19.840
as accompanimental
[phonetic] figuration.

00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:23.980
Just like in the Bach in the
A-flat prelude, it wasn't a fugue

00:36:23.980 --> 00:36:28.000
but there's that little turn idea,
that neighbor note idea that was--

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.890
that went back and forth
that was a little snippet

00:36:30.890 --> 00:36:34.630
that was already recognizable
when you'd hear.

00:36:34.630 --> 00:36:36.510
You have the same exact thing here,

00:36:36.510 --> 00:36:40.100
almost verbatim just
inverted in the Brahms.

00:36:40.100 --> 00:36:41.880
And so that starts to be used.

00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:47.270
You can see-- Well, it's-- it
will be better just to hear it

00:36:47.270 --> 00:36:50.660
when we get to it and just
hear how they're put together.

00:36:50.660 --> 00:36:57.300
The other point I'd like to
make about the Brahms' fugue

00:36:57.300 --> 00:37:01.270
in particular and, it also applies
to the Beethoven and to some

00:37:01.270 --> 00:37:08.160
of the Bach fugues as well,
is that of the issues--

00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:12.100 position:56%
it starts to become a drama-- a case
of what is important dramatically

00:37:12.100 --> 00:37:14.460 position:56%
to the music to push things forward.

00:37:14.460 --> 00:37:21.840
And Brahms at this point, I feel
that there's a great sense of ease

00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:24.240
with which he writes
this fugue that it feels

00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:28.890 position:56%
like this is exactly what it needs
to be for him and it encompasses him

00:37:28.890 --> 00:37:31.770 position:56%
as a pianist, as well as a composer.

00:37:31.770 --> 00:37:35.710
And this was I think one of the
most important moves for Brahms.

00:37:35.710 --> 00:37:41.740
Because as a pianist,
he was able to kind

00:37:41.740 --> 00:37:43.570
of make the fugue his
own in this way.

00:37:43.570 --> 00:37:48.140
So what you'll hear are
figurations and different types

00:37:48.140 --> 00:37:53.230
of sonorities put together with
the recognizable fugal elements

00:37:53.230 --> 00:37:56.100
that start to take on
a life of their own,

00:37:56.100 --> 00:38:00.220
as almost like their own
little cellular motivic ideas

00:38:00.220 --> 00:38:05.230
that could even be sort
of like a textural subject

00:38:05.230 --> 00:38:06.540
or something like that.

00:38:06.540 --> 00:38:09.770
I'm not saying that he treats it
exactly in a sort of academically

00:38:09.770 --> 00:38:12.250
that way, but you do
start to get that feeling.

00:38:12.250 --> 00:38:15.380
And eventually, you start to
forget about the fact that you're

00:38:15.380 --> 00:38:19.850
in the midst of this kind
of learned composition

00:38:19.850 --> 00:38:22.070
and just hear it as music.

00:38:22.070 --> 00:38:25.130
And I think that that's also
something that I suspect happens

00:38:25.130 --> 00:38:29.260
to a lot of us when we listen to
a fugue, is that we kind of think

00:38:29.260 --> 00:38:34.150
at the beginning, OK, there's
a voice and there's an answer,

00:38:34.150 --> 00:38:37.600
and then it comes back maybe at the
same pitch or something like that.

00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:41.780
And we follow it through this
exposition, but at some point,

00:38:41.780 --> 00:38:45.750
we start to just appreciate the way
that these voices are interacting

00:38:45.750 --> 00:38:49.490
in a way that just
makes for great music.

00:38:49.490 --> 00:38:52.830
So with that, I'd like to just
go ahead and close and be happy

00:38:52.830 --> 00:38:56.820
to take any questions
you might have.

00:38:56.820 --> 00:39:03.210
And if you could just wait for--

00:39:03.210 --> 00:39:07.720 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Do, we, musicians, you know, go
through these pieces the way you did

00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:13.190
with different versions of the
same piece by the composer?

00:39:13.190 --> 00:39:15.980
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Was the question
do musicians go through them?

00:39:15.980 --> 00:39:17.280
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:18.580
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Yeah.

00:39:18.580 --> 00:39:19.880
&gt;&gt; The way you did.

00:39:19.880 --> 00:39:21.180
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Yes.

00:39:21.180 --> 00:39:23.930
It just depends on the person
and the access that they have.

00:39:23.930 --> 00:39:28.490
So, one of the issues is that,
you know, often, we have our--

00:39:28.490 --> 00:39:32.970 position:56%
we might have a version of the piece
that we have back home that we used,

00:39:32.970 --> 00:39:35.250
you know, when we were kids
maybe or something like that.

00:39:35.250 --> 00:39:39.260
And eventually, you start to look
for other editions maybe edited

00:39:39.260 --> 00:39:41.770
by different people who you admire.

00:39:41.770 --> 00:39:45.870
But if you're at a professional
level and you're performing,

00:39:45.870 --> 00:39:48.410
you tend to want to make
your own decision as much

00:39:48.410 --> 00:39:50.730
as you can especially when dealing

00:39:50.730 --> 00:39:54.040
with these particular
types of pieces.

00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:56.720
And so, oftentimes, performers--

00:39:56.720 --> 00:39:58.510
there are performer
scholars that will go through

00:39:58.510 --> 00:40:01.600
and do their own research and
they're-- I think that what they--

00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:05.630
and, of course, I can't speak
for anybody but I do think

00:40:05.630 --> 00:40:10.030
that there is a sense in which
they arrive at the conclusion

00:40:10.030 --> 00:40:13.870
that here's a way that I
want to present this music

00:40:13.870 --> 00:40:18.680
that I believe is faithful to
an idea that was perhaps held

00:40:18.680 --> 00:40:23.260
by the composer but not necessarily
fidelity to a particular text.

00:40:23.260 --> 00:40:24.800
And just like I was
saying with the Brahms,

00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:28.410
you have all these notes here
that are in Brahms handwriting

00:40:28.410 --> 00:40:32.030
that did not make it
into a final edition.

00:40:32.030 --> 00:40:36.630
So, OK, maybe he though better
of it and took it out later.

00:40:36.630 --> 00:40:39.210
But there is something about
maybe an idea that are kernel

00:40:39.210 --> 00:40:41.670
of something that is worth-keeping.

00:40:41.670 --> 00:40:45.270
And so, I think it's up to each
musician to make a decision

00:40:45.270 --> 00:40:47.330
about what they'd like to do.

00:40:47.330 --> 00:40:50.910
And last thing I'd say about that
is that, you know, one of the goals

00:40:50.910 --> 00:40:54.740
of libraries and other
institutions is to try to make--

00:40:54.740 --> 00:40:58.370
the people who or the institutions
that hold these manuscripts is

00:40:58.370 --> 00:41:01.920
to try to make them as available
to those people as possible.

00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:04.250
And so for instance, this
particular manuscript,

00:41:04.250 --> 00:41:08.720
anybody here can go online to
our Performing Arts Encyclopedia

00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:11.960
and take a look at it yourself
and you can download images.

00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:14.320
Now, we don't have all of
our manuscripts up that way

00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:18.700
but that's an-- a way to make
them accessible to others.

00:41:18.700 --> 00:41:20.000
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:21.300
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: I think
we have another question.

00:41:21.300 --> 00:41:24.380
&gt;&gt; Is there any handout
left in the fugue?

00:41:24.380 --> 00:41:25.680
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: It's hot.

00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:28.650
It's too hot to handle
so I couldn't--

00:41:28.650 --> 00:41:32.210
well, but then I'm sorry but, no.

00:41:32.210 --> 00:41:33.510
Oh, go ahead.

00:41:33.510 --> 00:41:36.290
&gt;&gt; How long did Brahms worked
on manuscript for this?

00:41:36.290 --> 00:41:38.270
And, well, over what timeframe?

00:41:38.270 --> 00:41:40.150
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: You know what,
I don't know exactly the answer

00:41:40.150 --> 00:41:44.720
to that by I know that he
was-- it finished in 1861.

00:41:44.720 --> 00:41:48.870
I think it was relatively quick but
I don't want to say it incorrectly

00:41:48.870 --> 00:41:56.210
because he-- it's dated September
1861 which was the birthday

00:41:56.210 --> 00:41:58.960 position:56%
of Carla Schumann was in that month.

00:41:58.960 --> 00:42:02.010
So, I have a feeling it was in
the months just preceding that.

00:42:02.010 --> 00:42:04.710
I'm not sure.

00:42:04.710 --> 00:42:06.230
Is there another question?

00:42:06.230 --> 00:42:09.810
We have another one.

00:42:09.810 --> 00:42:11.110
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:42:11.110 --> 00:42:12.790
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Just one moment.

00:42:12.790 --> 00:42:14.420
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:42:14.420 --> 00:42:18.080
I have a question out
of complete ignorance.

00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:26.230 position:56%
Is the fugue the only structure in
which a theme, single theme is taken

00:42:26.230 --> 00:42:33.270
and repeated and kind of varied
on, oh, as opposed to beginning

00:42:33.270 --> 00:42:37.940 position:56%
at some point and ending in another,
it's-- is that true of the fugue?

00:42:37.940 --> 00:42:41.220
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Well, that's
actually a great and something

00:42:41.220 --> 00:42:42.880
that I could have been
much clear about.

00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:45.330
That's a very good question.

00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:52.670
To answer it quickly, I would
say that if you take an idea,

00:42:52.670 --> 00:42:54.940
a musical idea, you
can do lots of things

00:42:54.940 --> 00:42:58.380
to that musical idea
especially in a tonal context.

00:42:58.380 --> 00:43:03.220 position:56%
So, you can turn it upside down, you
can lengthen it, you can shorten it.

00:43:03.220 --> 00:43:05.370
To do that, you can do that
with any piece of music.

00:43:05.370 --> 00:43:08.370
So, sonatas, that's what
a lot of composers do.

00:43:08.370 --> 00:43:10.250 position:56%
They have-- They'll present material

00:43:10.250 --> 00:43:13.730
and they'll present contrasting
material with it perhaps,

00:43:13.730 --> 00:43:16.040
there might have-- it'd
be accompanied or not.

00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:18.490
And then, they'll tend to
develop it in some way.

00:43:18.490 --> 00:43:21.240
And that idea development
is where a lot

00:43:21.240 --> 00:43:25.420
of these different components
come into play like the imitation.

00:43:25.420 --> 00:43:30.060
And so, it's not just the preview
of kind of fugal academic wiring.

00:43:30.060 --> 00:43:33.780
It's just that in a few, there
tends to be a particular sequence

00:43:33.780 --> 00:43:38.060
of things that one expects to
find in that expository section.

00:43:38.060 --> 00:43:43.140 position:56%
So you have a subject that's
presented, it often is pretty short.

00:43:43.140 --> 00:43:45.780
And then, you'll have kind of
an answering to that subject

00:43:45.780 --> 00:43:49.380
which is basically a
transposition of that same material

00:43:49.380 --> 00:43:52.030
at a different level,
usually a fifth above

00:43:52.030 --> 00:43:54.410
or depending on the situation.

00:43:54.410 --> 00:43:58.110
And then-- So there's-- But like
I said, there's no single way

00:43:58.110 --> 00:43:59.610
that a fugue is constructed.

00:43:59.610 --> 00:44:01.970
There's also no single way
that a sonata is constructed.

00:44:01.970 --> 00:44:05.990
And you still have people writing
sonatas in very different ways.

00:44:05.990 --> 00:44:08.160
In some ways, it's
almost the sonata by fiat.

00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:10.010
They say it's a sonata
so it's a sonata.

00:44:10.010 --> 00:44:11.400
[ Laughter ]

00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:14.620 position:56%
With the fugue, it's a little harder
to do that because at some point,

00:44:14.620 --> 00:44:17.970
you'll say, well, I don't
hear any, you know, imitation

00:44:17.970 --> 00:44:20.180
or something like that but.

00:44:20.180 --> 00:44:22.740
So, I hope that kind of
answers a little bit.

00:44:22.740 --> 00:44:25.020
But it applies to lots
of different things.

00:44:25.020 --> 00:44:27.780
Is there another question?

00:44:27.780 --> 00:44:32.730
&gt;&gt; This may be too hot to
handle too but I was wondering

00:44:32.730 --> 00:44:35.740
about the performers on the
recordings that we heard

00:44:35.740 --> 00:44:39.920
and the examples, and
ones that you--

00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:45.360
maybe new people that you think
are good at interpretation.

00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:47.410
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: I will
tell you who you heard.

00:44:47.410 --> 00:44:50.680
I think I'll stay away
from the other.

00:44:50.680 --> 00:44:55.160
The Bach that you heard is from
Pierre-Laurent Aimard's new CD

00:44:55.160 --> 00:44:57.280
that was just released in August.

00:44:57.280 --> 00:45:02.100
And he has the entirety
of Book One on it.

00:45:02.100 --> 00:45:06.550
Again, there's another
discussion that's worth happening--

00:45:06.550 --> 00:45:10.640 position:56%
happening and interesting to have
about, you know, choosing to play it

00:45:10.640 --> 00:45:12.860
on a piano versus another
type of instrument

00:45:12.860 --> 00:45:14.680
and those types of things.

00:45:14.680 --> 00:45:19.230
But pianists tend to play in
piano so that why I chose that.

00:45:20.350 --> 00:45:27.410
The Beethoven's Paul Lewis who
was here a couple of years ago.

00:45:27.410 --> 00:45:33.290 position:56%
And the Handel, I'm just-- The
Brahms, I may actually just blanking

00:45:33.290 --> 00:45:34.650
on but it's a different pianist.

00:45:34.650 --> 00:45:39.440
So, I apologize for that but.

00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:41.510
So, sorry-- Yeah but I've-- yeah.

00:45:41.510 --> 00:45:47.680
I think we have time for one
more question if there's anybody?

00:45:47.680 --> 00:45:49.120
There's one up here.

00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:53.810
&gt;&gt; It seems to me a few years
ago at the Freer Gallery,

00:45:53.810 --> 00:45:57.820
I remember hearing the Brahms,
but it was two-pianists,

00:45:57.820 --> 00:46:01.000
it was Emanuel Ax and a woman--

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:02.300
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Maybe--

00:46:02.300 --> 00:46:04.140
&gt;&gt; And I'm wondering, did the
Brahms recasts this several times?

00:46:04.140 --> 00:46:05.720
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: I think
in the Haydn variations.

00:46:05.720 --> 00:46:07.020
&gt;&gt; Oh. OK.

00:46:07.020 --> 00:46:09.560 position:56%
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: No, no, because he
did a two-piano version of that one.

00:46:09.560 --> 00:46:10.860
&gt;&gt; OK. OK.

00:46:10.860 --> 00:46:14.460
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Yeah, which is
also a great piece, yeah, yeah.

00:46:14.460 --> 00:46:17.410
We can take one more
if there's one more.

00:46:17.410 --> 00:46:20.050
But there doesn't have
to be one more, does it?

00:46:20.050 --> 00:46:22.080
[ Laughter ]

00:46:22.080 --> 00:46:24.210
We'll, thank you-- Oh,
well, one more, OK.

00:46:24.210 --> 00:46:31.460
One more.

00:46:31.460 --> 00:46:34.980 position:56%
&gt;&gt; You didn't go into the origins
of the fugue and most people I think

00:46:34.980 --> 00:46:42.470
in the most elementary way think of
it as developing out of the round.

00:46:42.470 --> 00:46:47.240
And here, I know I do, I hear
the round in almost every fugue

00:46:47.240 --> 00:46:49.150
and that's the way I approach it.

00:46:49.150 --> 00:46:51.190
Could you talk a little
bit about that?

00:46:51.190 --> 00:46:55.100
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: That's a very
complicated issue and there's--

00:46:55.100 --> 00:47:00.060
so there's a history going way
before Bach's time in terms

00:47:00.060 --> 00:47:04.780
of what-- where a fugue comes
from, things like the Ricercar,

00:47:04.780 --> 00:47:08.080
all these other types
of predecessors.

00:47:08.080 --> 00:47:12.230 position:56%
But ultimately, what they're founded
on and I think it'd be better

00:47:12.230 --> 00:47:16.810
to look to somebody who's more of
a scholar in that area than I am.

00:47:16.810 --> 00:47:22.670 position:56%
But ultimately, what they're founded
on are relationships between ideas

00:47:22.670 --> 00:47:26.440
of counted point and
imitation on those types

00:47:26.440 --> 00:47:28.710
of things and imitative behaviors.

00:47:28.710 --> 00:47:31.570
So, certain types of rules
start to develop over--

00:47:31.570 --> 00:47:35.120
when I say rules, I'm not saying
necessarily written-down rules

00:47:35.120 --> 00:47:40.220
but just rules that tend
to work in practice.

00:47:40.220 --> 00:47:43.360
Over time, those develop and
eventually become codified

00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:46.670
by different theorists at
different points thinking

00:47:46.670 --> 00:47:49.630
of the Gradus ad Parnassum or
things like that where, you know,

00:47:49.630 --> 00:47:55.920
people are trying to come to
grips with what's happening.

00:47:55.920 --> 00:48:01.240
Not necessarily providing
a groundwork for what--

00:48:01.240 --> 00:48:03.100
how people should produce.

00:48:03.100 --> 00:48:05.000
But eventually, you
do get that as well

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:09.280
and so there's this
lengthy process development

00:48:09.280 --> 00:48:13.490
that is not a singular
branch on a tree, I think.

00:48:13.490 --> 00:48:16.660
I think that there are lots
of different approaches that--

00:48:16.660 --> 00:48:21.200
and even today, you know,
people still write fugues.

00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:26.060
But it's, you know, maybe most
of them tend to be traceable

00:48:26.060 --> 00:48:30.030
to the 18th Century in terms
of where they're coming from,

00:48:30.030 --> 00:48:33.090
in terms of what they
identify as a fugue proper.

00:48:33.090 --> 00:48:38.260
But, I think that other
traditions are also represented.

00:48:38.260 --> 00:48:43.510
So, sorry, I'm not able
simply address that but.

00:48:43.510 --> 00:48:46.420
Well, thank you so much and I hope
you enjoyed tonight's concert.

00:48:46.420 --> 00:48:48.510
And I assure you will.
