So anyways,

22
00:01:17.871 --> 00:01:18.800

23
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.240

24
00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:26.840

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:33.230
We love getting the compliments.
Oh my God.
I know right?

27
00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.140
I did that.
You know I didn't,

28
00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:40.320
I took a half court shot and God did the rest of the law.

29
00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.860
Um,
anyways,
so we ended up going out to a steak house,
right.
Sydney.
I was like,

30
00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.510
I don't want to stick but I'd like some steak.
Are you going to order a steak?

31
00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:55.370
And it's like,
yes.
When in Rome.
Hi.
Hi.

32
00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:59.720
Hi.
Did you just say hi to me?
You say hi to the listeners.
Qt.

33
00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:04.040
So me as just like a,
you kind of get a steak.

34
00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.430
I don't want to want a whole steak.
I wanted to get tuna tar,

35
00:02:07.431 --> 00:02:11.600
tar and I wanted a crap.
The lump crab cake,
which is what you ordered.
Yes.

36
00:02:11.601 --> 00:02:14.690
And I wanted a little bit as day cause I want to do a little surf and turf.
Yeah.

37
00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.190
So what does all freckles to what is all freckles still?
He orders of course.

38
00:02:19.191 --> 00:02:23.430
What do you order?
Oh,
Billy steak face.
I ordered the bone in Ribeye.

39
00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.260
How the hell did that happen?
Sorry,
what just happened there?

40
00:02:28.261 --> 00:02:32.460
Somehow I moved in.
The volume got turned down anyways,

41
00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:36.510
I'll have to edit that part out.
So anyways,
all Billy stake face,

42
00:02:36.511 --> 00:02:41.250
I order a bone in Ribeye.
So Cutie Pie here starts getting frustrated.

43
00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.080
Nah,
starts making noise and I,
you know,
I don't want to be that guy.

44
00:02:44.081 --> 00:02:45.750
It's a restaurant with a baby that's crying,

45
00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:49.650
especially in a steakhouse steak house.
She have a lot of people,

46
00:02:49.651 --> 00:02:54.540
they're in their second marriages.
People who you know,
didn't get married,

47
00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.870
guys who are paying for a house that they're no longer allowed to go into.

48
00:02:57.871 --> 00:03:00.250
You know,
there's a lot of that go there.
You know,

49
00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:03.610
a lot of child support being paid,
you know,

50
00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.220
by some of these people who had to rebuild it again.

51
00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.700
So the led lady g of belly hanging out.
Look at your belly hanging out,

52
00:03:09.701 --> 00:03:13.060
what are you doing?
So she was,
my daughter was getting frustrated,

53
00:03:13.061 --> 00:03:13.960
so I just started,

54
00:03:13.961 --> 00:03:18.961
I started walking around the restaurant and everything like that being the

55
00:03:20.321 --> 00:03:24.580
amazing father that I am right running around,
she still short.
I got to like,

56
00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.720
you know,
bend it that angle,
then it's like killing my back.
But I,

57
00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:30.670
but I stuck it out.
I did it for you.

58
00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.790
I did it for all those divorces in there.
Right.

59
00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:35.740
All those people paying child support,

60
00:03:35.741 --> 00:03:38.080
even though the women that women are starting to pay child support to.

61
00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:42.880
Oh you haven't seen it,
you haven't read that.
And cosmo.
Cosmo,
yeah.

62
00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.500
Yeah.
And they out there that complaining that which I love.

63
00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.720
I love this whole equal pay cause you wait near,

64
00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.260
you wait until enough women have to start paying child support and you watch

65
00:03:53.261 --> 00:03:58.150
those divorce laws changed.
Um,
so anyways,

66
00:03:58.151 --> 00:04:02.410
while I'm being the amazing father then than I am obviously,
this is my,
uh,

67
00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.850
this is my version of the story.
Uh,
my stake arrives.

68
00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:12.550
So Nia goes to cutoff her portion of the steak and basically what she does is

69
00:04:12.551 --> 00:04:16.570
she cuts the thing like length wise,
right?

70
00:04:16.571 --> 00:04:21.571
A lot like an inch away from the bone and she takes all the meat along the bone

71
00:04:21.821 --> 00:04:24.780
and then gives me the rest of it.
And for those of you who aren't meat eaters,

72
00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.540
all you vegetarians out there,
the most flavorful part of a bone in Ribeye,

73
00:04:28.541 --> 00:04:30.250
the reason is,
is all along the bone.

74
00:04:30.251 --> 00:04:34.150
And she took the best meat and I was so upset with her.

75
00:04:34.151 --> 00:04:37.810
I told her that she needed to go to ancestry.com because that was some northern

76
00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:41.320
white European shit.
What you just did there?

77
00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:48.910
I
uh,
I,
yeah,
I took the yeah,
I did.

78
00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:51.730
That's my favorite fight.
The bone.

79
00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:57.550
All right guys.
Ever want to know?

80
00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:01.000
If you want to know what it's like to be a husband and a father,

81
00:05:01.001 --> 00:05:04.330
that's what it is.
She makes the baby.

82
00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:08.020
She goes through all of that.
She goes through nine months of hell,

83
00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:11.200
10 months a hell.
Actually that's the middle three.

84
00:05:11.201 --> 00:05:13.060
That's like the summer vacation.
But whatever.

85
00:05:13.061 --> 00:05:16.660
We'll say 10 months of hell and you know what?
And then as a guy,

86
00:05:16.661 --> 00:05:19.090
you pay for it for the rest of the relationship.

87
00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:24.690
She gets it all back with little f little shady cuts of bone in Ribeye.

88
00:05:24.971 --> 00:05:27.970
I couldn't believe that.
Hi.

89
00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:33.370
Hi Cutie.
Huh?
She is in love with you.

90
00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.450
Yeah.
Well,
you know,
and I'll be in love with her until the day she takes the,

91
00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:40.960
the good part of my cheerio's.
Alright.

92
00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:45.100
Hi.
How are you,
Cutie.
All right,

93
00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:48.730
daddy has to talk filthy so I can still buy your diapers.
That's how it works.

94
00:05:48.731 --> 00:05:53.410
I'm sorry I'm too far down this road to pretend that you have a respectable
dead.

95
00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:57.070
All right,
lovely ladies.
Well,
I mean,

96
00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.820
I thought that you were going to try to defend your position and you didn't you

97
00:05:59.821 --> 00:06:03.700
like,
yeah,
I did that.
That's what I did.
I mean,
that's,
that's,

98
00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:05.850
that's really all there is to say.

99
00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:10.890
I want the meet along the long you're doing Donald Trump right now.

100
00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:13.080
What does that,
that's how he got out of stuff.

101
00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.910
You said all this stuff about women and he's like,
no,

102
00:06:15.911 --> 00:06:18.230
I said that about Rosie O'donnell.
And they were like,
no,

103
00:06:18.231 --> 00:06:23.120
you said that about other women.
He was like,
Hey,
probably right.
It's like,

104
00:06:23.121 --> 00:06:23.954
all right.

105
00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:27.140
I thought that was going to be a big funny fight and it was nothing out.

106
00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:30.110
You're on my ankle.
Okay.

107
00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:34.370
All right ladies.
Bye Bye.

108
00:06:34.371 --> 00:06:37.910
Can you say bye bye
bye bye.

109
00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:43.970
All right.
Oh well yeah,

110
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:44.840
I'll see you later.

111
00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:50.150
Okay.

112
00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:57.020
You get my sake and I get it cheaper later.
Let me guess.

113
00:06:57.021 --> 00:07:00.290
Mcdonald's,
what do you guys want?
What do you like Betty?

114
00:07:00.291 --> 00:07:03.780
Like Mcdonald's or Burger King?
I,
but I've always been a McDonald's guy.
Oh,

115
00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:08.060
he's been Mcdonald's and it's not like I'm out here looking for another

116
00:07:08.061 --> 00:07:10.250
advertiser.
I'll tell you right now,

117
00:07:10.251 --> 00:07:15.251
I feel the best poisoned in fast food is Mcdonald's.

118
00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:18.800
This is how I would,
I would rank this how I ranked my fast food cheeseburgers.

119
00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:21.320
Nia.
All right.

120
00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:25.040
As much as there's some great ones out there like in and out.

121
00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:29.410
I have to go to Mcdonald's cause the child's sense memory,
you know,

122
00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:33.470
that just takes me back to,
you know,
when my bicycle was orange,

123
00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:39.010
just like my hair that I used to have and I had the white tape around the handle

124
00:07:39.411 --> 00:07:43.090
bars.
Huh?
Tell you what happened.
I went to the,
um,

125
00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:45.640
to see my trainer and when I got in there,
oh yeah.

126
00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:49.510
Did you take the Best Matt in the gym?
Yes.

127
00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:53.140
And he was finishing up with another client and she had her daughter there who

128
00:07:53.141 --> 00:07:56.050
was like four years old and she's so cute.
So I was like,
oh,

129
00:07:56.051 --> 00:07:57.490
you want to see pictures of my baby?

130
00:07:57.491 --> 00:08:01.240
And so I was showing her pictures of the baby and then she saw a picture of you

131
00:08:01.241 --> 00:08:05.300
with the baby and she goes,
who's that?
And I said,
Oh that's,
I'm her daddy,

132
00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:09.610
that's my husband.
And she goes,
okay.
She goes,
why doesn't he have any hair?

133
00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:14.020
Who said that the kid can the for her all?
And I said,
well,
you know,

134
00:08:14.021 --> 00:08:18.400
sometimes when people get older,
you know,
their hair starts to come out.

135
00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:22.060
And so he just decided to cut it off because he didn't want it just to be

136
00:08:22.061 --> 00:08:25.000
falling out.
And I think it looks better this way.
And she was like,
yeah,

137
00:08:25.001 --> 00:08:25.834
that's true.

138
00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:31.690
Why did I need to know that there was a cute already feel bad enough about

139
00:08:31.691 --> 00:08:35.860
myself?
Do you want me to,
kids have looked at me and said,
you're ugly in my life.

140
00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:40.600
At least six.
No,
I swear to God,
we,
when I had hair,

141
00:08:41.830 --> 00:08:45.990
yeah,
children and children are honest.
What do y'all,

142
00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:48.230
you adults would do and you just be a nice to me,

143
00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:53.690
maybe you deserve that bone in Ribeye and just give me the ship by Ai.
Yeah.

144
00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:57.810
Ugly piece of Shit.
Get out of here.
Meaning like that.
Yeah.

145
00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:01.220
Cute story now.
Yeah.
Yeah.

146
00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:03.470
I met this girl the other day and she,

147
00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:07.230
I showed her a picture of you and she was like,
hey,
why is your butt's so big?

148
00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:12.150
And I was like,
well,
you know,
you bought isn't big.
All right,

149
00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:13.530
but if not,
I'm going to fucking pay for either.

150
00:09:13.531 --> 00:09:15.870
You're going to laugh at that and I'm going to pay for that comment forever.

151
00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:21.110
Yeah,
right.
You could just,
you could just eviscerate me.
I,

152
00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:25.220
first of all,
I didn't say anything.
It was just child that said it.

153
00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:28.180
So I don't know why you're making up some scenario where someone's insulting.

154
00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:32.600
Like my looks,
that's not a child.
And for the record,

155
00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:36.440
my ass might be big,
but it's like perfect.
So it is,

156
00:09:36.441 --> 00:09:39.550
it's why I married you with certain wasn't certainly wasn't the other end.

157
00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:45.880
There are other end.
I have no problem with the,
if she for fucking Yap,

158
00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:49.220
that drives me up the wall.
Alright.
Whatever.
Why,
why?

159
00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:52.850
Why do I try to make a point?
Why do I try to get ahead?
They know what I mean.

160
00:09:52.851 --> 00:09:56.780
It's just like,
Bill,
you're losing.
Okay.
You're at a casino in the house.

161
00:09:56.781 --> 00:09:58.910
Always wins in the house.
Did you fucking wife?

162
00:09:58.911 --> 00:10:03.300
So just fucking cash in your chips and go back to the Goddamn Room.

163
00:10:03.830 --> 00:10:06.410
Anyways,
let's get back to the NHL playoffs.

164
00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:12.140
Congratulations to the fucking expansion.
Tampa lightening.

165
00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:16.640
I don't hate you guys cause I love Steve Byars him and I know he's in your front

166
00:10:16.641 --> 00:10:20.480
office so I'm happy for him.
All right.
Okay.

167
00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:22.070
Having said that,

168
00:10:23.210 --> 00:10:27.470
you guys were the better team no matter how bad the officiating was.

169
00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:31.930
It was bad for both sides.
Um,
and no matter what,
I think you guys still,

170
00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:33.370
you should,
you just were a better tape.

171
00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:35.630
You just were a better team no matter what you were going to win.

172
00:10:35.631 --> 00:10:36.560
But I will say this,

173
00:10:36.561 --> 00:10:40.460
this officiating straight across the board in the NHL playoffs,

174
00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:45.490
not just arguing for my team has been really a unprofessional,

175
00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:51.230
really unprofessional.
There's always a couple of calls here or there,
but like,

176
00:10:51.231 --> 00:10:56.090
it's reminding me of NBA officiating last decade when I called it,

177
00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:59.300
I said it was fixed.
I'm not saying it's fixed,

178
00:10:59.301 --> 00:11:03.470
this is coming off more like,
I feel like it's like,

179
00:11:03.471 --> 00:11:07.320
did the real refs go on strike?
And these are like some fucking scab refs.

180
00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:12.290
They pulled out of the fucking crowd.
Um,
it was just a couple of like,

181
00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:15.710
look,
you know,
Marshawn took that guy's fucking knees out.

182
00:11:15.711 --> 00:11:19.640
They didn't make a call there,
which I thought was bullshit.
And uh,
you know,

183
00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:24.050
I know we were licking people's faces and this is no rule against that yet.

184
00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:28.280
I can guarantee you maybe now that the Bruins are knocked out,
maybe they'll,

185
00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:32.060
they'll relax.
But I mean,
I thought if we advanced to the next round,

186
00:11:32.061 --> 00:11:35.380
they were going to make a quick rule that's going to be called the Marshawn

187
00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:38.270
rural and it's going to be no player Shell,
kiss,

188
00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:43.330
lick tongue or in any manner at use his facial or a fist

189
00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:48.810
to with inappropriate contact.
There's going to be the,

190
00:11:48.811 --> 00:11:53.680
there's gotta be the Brad Marshawn rule and someday if I live enough,

191
00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:58.000
I will see Brad when he's in his seventies on the NHL Network,

192
00:11:58.030 --> 00:11:59.110
laughing about it,

193
00:11:59.111 --> 00:12:04.111
talking about how that rule came about and why he was doing what he was doing.

194
00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:10.000
Um,
it's the most bizarre thing I've ever seen.
And it was,

195
00:12:10.001 --> 00:12:14.680
it was,
it was hilarious when they went back to the,
to studio,
Jeremy Ronek was,

196
00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:17.200
is it was like,
it happened to him.
He's like,

197
00:12:17.201 --> 00:12:20.320
I would have immediately gone to the showers and I was thinking like,
oh,

198
00:12:20.321 --> 00:12:23.680
that's great.
You're all of fame player.
Let's get you off the ice.

199
00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:28.030
Um,
I had a buddy of mine actually texted me,
said,

200
00:12:28.031 --> 00:12:31.600
not even Sean Avery licked and other player and I was like,
yeah,

201
00:12:31.601 --> 00:12:35.050
well he was too dumb to think of it.
And he goes,
well,

202
00:12:35.051 --> 00:12:38.650
if he's that dumb is he married to a supermodel?
And I said,
all right,

203
00:12:38.651 --> 00:12:43.240
fair enough.
You got me.
Um,
anyways,
but just,
you know,
I mean,

204
00:12:43.241 --> 00:12:45.470
what the fuck that guy,
the guy in Tampa,

205
00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:50.490
like we really needed to win game four so we can lose in six games and it was

206
00:12:50.801 --> 00:12:54.700
still going to lose the fucking Tampa is his hands off his stick.

207
00:12:54.730 --> 00:12:58.060
He hauls McAvoy down behind his own net,

208
00:12:58.750 --> 00:13:03.040
behind his own fucking net.
No call.
It was,

209
00:13:03.041 --> 00:13:05.730
it was the most obvious.
Did Not only did the announces,

210
00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:08.800
when they went back to the fucking studio even,
they were like,
what the fuck?

211
00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:10.270
Tampa takes it,

212
00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:14.080
pass it over stamp coast and they tie the fucking game up and Wheaton instead of

213
00:13:14.590 --> 00:13:19.590
having a chance to even this series at two two we go down three one it was just

214
00:13:20.351 --> 00:13:22.040
stuff like that.
I,
you know,
it's funny,
as Bart,

215
00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:25.630
nick was in Tampa Bay and he was listening to it on the radio and Esposito said

216
00:13:25.631 --> 00:13:29.500
that it looked like a dive,
which is the funniest fucking thing ever.

217
00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:35.670
Esposito is still fucking pissed that he asked for like $3 more from the cheap

218
00:13:36.701 --> 00:13:40.360
ass Boston Bruins 45 years ago and they ship them to New York,

219
00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:43.570
our archrival other than the Canadians during that time.

220
00:13:43.571 --> 00:13:47.290
So he will never be impartial when it comes to us.
But what the fuck?

221
00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:52.980
Who the fuck is going to dive behind their own net with the puck behind your own

222
00:13:54.071 --> 00:13:57.670
fucking net when you're up by one and you have to win that playoff game?

223
00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:02.260
Are you going to go down three games to one?
I don't know.
He is Esposito.

224
00:14:02.261 --> 00:14:07.240
He is a hall of Famer,
but that did not look like a dive to me.

225
00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:09.730
And having said all this fucking sour grape shit,

226
00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:12.070
I know Tampa's still would've won.
I know they probably would have wanted to.

227
00:14:12.071 --> 00:14:13.900
Probably six games is what I think would have happened.

228
00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:15.790
They just had too much fire power.

229
00:14:15.791 --> 00:14:20.740
And I think by the time we decided to get physical in the series it was too
late.

230
00:14:20.741 --> 00:14:21.574
But um,

231
00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.950
that's what was missing in our game this year I think against Toronto and

232
00:14:26.951 --> 00:14:27.820
against Tampa,

233
00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:32.740
which both of them I felt had more firepower than we did is when you're playing

234
00:14:32.741 --> 00:14:34.900
a team that has,
you know,

235
00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:39.130
as faster than you and has more gold scores,
you have to get physical with them.

236
00:14:39.131 --> 00:14:43.180
You can't just let them fucking skate around it.
I think we just waited too long.

237
00:14:43.181 --> 00:14:47.680
But I haven't said that this rebuild is on an upswing.
I mean,

238
00:14:47.681 --> 00:14:50.440
I thought that we were going to be bad for a good six,
seven seasons.

239
00:14:50.441 --> 00:14:54.680
I didn't the light at the end of the tunnel.
So I'm very happy that we,
uh,

240
00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:56.960
we want to play off series advanced to the second round.

241
00:14:57.030 --> 00:15:02.030
Definitely a very successful year and we're going to have a new rule named after

242
00:15:02.361 --> 00:15:04.040
one of our players to Marshawn rule.

243
00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:12.230
Maybe it's a good thing that we lost in five.
If there was any more games,

244
00:15:12.231 --> 00:15:17.231
he might've been the first guy to get a fucking meat to case from another guy,

245
00:15:17.331 --> 00:15:19.070
right?
Oh No,
no.
Wait,
that one guy did.

246
00:15:19.071 --> 00:15:23.060
The agent did with the other guy from the cop show.
All right.

247
00:15:23.061 --> 00:15:25.370
I guess everything's been done.
Is that what it is?

248
00:15:25.371 --> 00:15:27.020
Has everything been done in the whole time?

249
00:15:27.021 --> 00:15:30.860
This is what kills me is I'm watching the Bruins,
you know,

250
00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:35.940
just fucking losing this series,
licking people's faces and shit and I have,

251
00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:41.030
I've missed every single second of the Celtic 76 you know,
I just,

252
00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:44.390
I had to pick a road.
I'm so busy,

253
00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:47.810
I've got the kid and all that and I only had time and I missed I guess one of

254
00:15:47.811 --> 00:15:52.811
the most epic Celtics Games in recent memory where they tied it up at the buzzer

255
00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:56.240
against the sixes and then came back and won in overtime.
All I'm hearing is

256
00:15:58.490 --> 00:15:59.630
Rosier Tatum Brown,
how much they're stepping up.

257
00:15:59.631 --> 00:16:04.550
Al Horford I guess was a blocking shots like a maniac.
And uh,

258
00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:08.870
so now I gotta go,
um,
I gotta I gotta say I have,

259
00:16:08.871 --> 00:16:11.540
I have all the time in the world to watch the Celtics now.

260
00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:15.110
So that's what I kind of realized.
You know,

261
00:16:15.111 --> 00:16:16.790
as much as I love the Celtics and everything,

262
00:16:16.791 --> 00:16:20.420
I really am a hockey guy because I knew we were going to lose that series and I

263
00:16:20.421 --> 00:16:22.520
still hung in there and watched it.

264
00:16:22.521 --> 00:16:25.880
Although I missed yesterday's game because I was at a kid birthday party,

265
00:16:26.570 --> 00:16:29.710
an awesome kid.
Birthday party,
like a,
you know,

266
00:16:29.711 --> 00:16:33.650
you know when parents do a kid birthday party,
right?
You take notes.

267
00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:36.500
These people did a great,
they didn't have it at their house.

268
00:16:36.501 --> 00:16:39.800
They had it at like a function room.
There was an outdoor area,

269
00:16:39.801 --> 00:16:44.180
there was a little jumpy house.
This guy did a bubble show,
you know,

270
00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:47.570
he had a good set to man.
That's a tough crowd.
You know,
kids trying to keep them,

271
00:16:47.571 --> 00:16:52.040
you know,
their attention.
They had booze for the parents,
they had great food,

272
00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:56.220
you know,
and then,
uh,
over in the corner they had this area where the kids do,

273
00:16:56.221 --> 00:16:58.910
you know,
one of those playpens that has like a Zillion,
you know,

274
00:17:00.170 --> 00:17:02.740
different multicolored balls and all that type of interests.

275
00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:05.330
My kid was totally entertained the whole time.

276
00:17:05.331 --> 00:17:09.440
I don't think I saw any kid crying just until the very end where the kids,

277
00:17:09.441 --> 00:17:13.930
you know,
they need a nap and they just like,
Hey,
I want to do it.
But,
um,

278
00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:19.010
it was a great time.
So,
uh,
somebody there asked me,
he goes,

279
00:17:19.011 --> 00:17:21.170
you Bruins plane right now.
I'm like,
I'm afraid to look.

280
00:17:21.820 --> 00:17:24.650
So I was kind of looking down and looking at the scores and then all my Boston

281
00:17:24.651 --> 00:17:28.640
friends was sending me texts going,
what the fuck are we doing?

282
00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:33.170
These refs sock.
The refs really did suck.
Um,

283
00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:35.420
you know,
who knows?

284
00:17:35.421 --> 00:17:38.120
They probably still would've maybe tied it up and beat his son five.

285
00:17:38.121 --> 00:17:41.540
Who the fuck knows?
But I'm just saying,
you know,
I just hate having that,
like

286
00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:47.330
that goddamn feeling.
You know,
it's like that year the Lakers beat us.
You know,

287
00:17:47.331 --> 00:17:50.070
which sucks enough.
But if the Lakers,
it's fine.

288
00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:53.490
I can live with that to the fucking Lakers.
You know what I mean?

289
00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:56.220
But you know,

290
00:17:56.250 --> 00:17:59.700
you call like 30 something flowers on one team and you know,

291
00:17:59.701 --> 00:18:03.900
in the teens on the other and a game seven,
it's just inexcusable.

292
00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:07.170
Unless we were out there hacking people up and it just,
I dunno,

293
00:18:08.010 --> 00:18:11.160
fucking drives me up.
The God,
they,
those are the ones that stay with me.

294
00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:14.970
You know what I mean?
I don't give a fuck if you just come in and kick our ass,

295
00:18:14.971 --> 00:18:15.930
but we don't.
I,
but I,

296
00:18:15.931 --> 00:18:19.890
I do take peace in the fact that the Tampa Bay was definitely the better team

297
00:18:19.891 --> 00:18:24.630
and I feel that the
easily could have just beat us in six.

298
00:18:24.990 --> 00:18:28.650
Um,
as much as I hate to admit that you motherfuckers,
um,
anyways,
plowing ahead.

299
00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:30.690
What's going to go on with the capital's?

300
00:18:30.930 --> 00:18:35.520
The capital's finally going to get over the Hump and slay the dragon and beat

301
00:18:35.521 --> 00:18:39.330
these goddamn penguins from Pittsburgh or the Pittsburgh penguins going to

302
00:18:39.331 --> 00:18:44.331
continue their march to be the first team since the New York Islanders is,

303
00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:48.270
Steve Byrne reminded me yesterday,

304
00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:53.940
it's The New York islanders to win three in a row.
I'd spend that long.

305
00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:58.560
The island is actually won four in a row from 80 to 84.

306
00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:02.060
And um,
I remember them,

307
00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:05.310
they were on the cover the next year of sports illustrated and they said the

308
00:19:05.311 --> 00:19:08.190
strive for five to assume,
you know,
the ray,

309
00:19:08.191 --> 00:19:11.340
one of the rare times sports illustrated portal hockey player back then,

310
00:19:11.341 --> 00:19:15.270
you know,
on the cover.
I think it was Mike Bossy,
if I remember correctly.

311
00:19:16.050 --> 00:19:18.690
And um,
yeah,

312
00:19:18.691 --> 00:19:21.300
that was the age of dynasties when I grew up,

313
00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:23.880
when I think about it from like,

314
00:19:26.230 --> 00:19:31.180
you look at the 70s in hockey Bruins,
one,
two flyers,
one,

315
00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:35.710
two,
and the Canadians one six.

316
00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:39.580
So you had three teams,
basically won everything.

317
00:19:39.581 --> 00:19:44.350
And then the previous decade it was,
it was Canadians,

318
00:19:45.010 --> 00:19:49.000
leafs,
and then the Blackhawks won one.
Um,

319
00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:53.410
and then I think Canadians,
one,
five and,
and the least one four,

320
00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:55.330
cause I want to say the least one like three in a row.

321
00:19:55.331 --> 00:20:00.331
And then one in 67 and the Blackhawks won in [inaudible] 61 and everything else

322
00:20:00.371 --> 00:20:04.600
was the Canadians,
if I remember correctly.
Um,

323
00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:10.250
and then you went to the eighties than the islanders.
So basically after the,
the,

324
00:20:10.610 --> 00:20:14.650
uh,
it went Bruins,
Canadians,
Bruins,
Colleen's flyers,
flyers,
then Canadians,

325
00:20:14.651 --> 00:20:18.220
Canadians,
Canadians,
Canadians and islanders,
islanders,
islanders,
islanders,

326
00:20:18.430 --> 00:20:21.430
Edmonton,
Edmonton,
Canadians,
Edmonton,

327
00:20:21.431 --> 00:20:26.280
Edmonton than Calgary.
Beat the fucking Canadians.

328
00:20:26.470 --> 00:20:31.060
That one of my favorite one,
landing macdonald,
the ginger.
Um,

329
00:20:31.150 --> 00:20:35.670
and then Edmonton again in 90.
And then 91,

330
00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:37.860
92 was the penguins.

331
00:20:37.890 --> 00:20:40.920
And that was like immediate talking a,

332
00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:44.990
I mean,
you could literally go back all the way to the 50s,

333
00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:49.360
cause I know like the Redwings one like to back and everything else was just,

334
00:20:49.361 --> 00:20:54.361
it was just fucking basically pre 1967 if you had to guess who won the cup that

335
00:20:54.671 --> 00:20:58.690
year,
either guests,
Canadians or may beliefs.
Um,

336
00:20:59.950 --> 00:21:01.540
but then all of a sudden,
you know,
once,
you know,

337
00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:06.100
they had the expansion six and 67,
and then they added a,
you know,

338
00:21:06.101 --> 00:21:10.300
Edmonton Oilers and all those guys and like I believe 78 or something like that.

339
00:21:10.750 --> 00:21:13.930
And then it was a 28 team league and it just took a little bit.

340
00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:19.030
We'll actually,
the island is where expansion team in the early seventies.

341
00:21:19.690 --> 00:21:22.960
Then they got Allah,
they went on that run.

342
00:21:24.010 --> 00:21:28.570
But uh,
then after that,
after the penguins went back to back,

343
00:21:28.571 --> 00:21:30.400
it's just basically every other year.

344
00:21:30.401 --> 00:21:35.200
It's like somebody else wins it other than the one the Redwings one,

345
00:21:35.201 --> 00:21:38.710
two in a row.
And I think,
uh,
the penguins right now,
right.

346
00:21:39.310 --> 00:21:43.510
It's not how it goes.
I don't fucking know.
Um,
but anyways,

347
00:21:43.930 --> 00:21:47.740
which is why I hate to say this is a Celtics fan.
I think the,
uh,
the Lakers are,

348
00:21:47.770 --> 00:21:49.660
they,
they're the most successful franchise

349
00:21:51.250 --> 00:21:56.250
in the modern era because they were able to during free agency win championships

350
00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:03.220
at a clip that people,
one before,
you know,
back when there was like a,
you know,

351
00:22:03.250 --> 00:22:05.620
if you were a Laker you were a lake or go fuck yourself.

352
00:22:05.650 --> 00:22:09.390
You're not going somewhere else unless the owner decides.
Um,

353
00:22:10.150 --> 00:22:13.960
they haven't said that.
You know,
the Lakers do have a championship,
uh,

354
00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:15.713
that,
you know,

355
00:22:16.090 --> 00:22:19.780
there was a mobbed up reference fucked over the Sacramento Kings that year.

356
00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:21.660
I'm not saying the kings would have wanted,

357
00:22:21.670 --> 00:22:23.860
but the Lakers would not have gotten a banner that year.

358
00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:28.920
And then that other one with the fucking 30 something files 37 files in 48

359
00:22:29.081 --> 00:22:33.820
minutes of the Celtics
and never forget Colby.
He goes,

360
00:22:33.821 --> 00:22:35.260
I don't know how we won that game.

361
00:22:35.290 --> 00:22:40.200
Well fucking talk to the guys with the athlete's foot shirts.
Um,

362
00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:45.820
anyways,
sorry,
I'm just in a fucking bad mood cause my team lost.
Um,

363
00:22:47.710 --> 00:22:52.210
anyways,
plowing ahead here.
Uh,
old Billy,
no vice

364
00:22:53.890 --> 00:22:58.600
trudging along into May.
I want to go at least a weekend of May.

365
00:22:58.750 --> 00:23:02.560
Cause I was just trying to go,
you know,
the,
the month of April,

366
00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:08.200
basically vice lists and then I got into May and then I'm just like,

367
00:23:08.201 --> 00:23:12.490
you know what,
I'm looking good.
I'm keeping the weight off.
I got the Big Five,

368
00:23:12.670 --> 00:23:13.510
oh next month.

369
00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:18.220
It would really be a shame if I got this close to my birthday.

370
00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:22.540
Look in this good.
And then I just,
you know,
I just fucking,
you know,

371
00:23:24.190 --> 00:23:28.450
put on that booze 10 pounds.
I don't want to do that.
But,
so,
uh,

372
00:23:28.930 --> 00:23:33.370
I've been laying off,
laying off board as shit

373
00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:38.280
went to that party yesterday.
There was booze there.
Could have had one.

374
00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:41.510
Didn't do it.
Went to the steak house,

375
00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:45.860
said all the beautiful fucking bottles behind the bar.
Didn't do it.

376
00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:49.670
Came home,
trudge,
pass my bar.

377
00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:56.170
They don't even say hi anymore.
Didn't do it.
Went downstairs,

378
00:23:57.770 --> 00:24:00.410
took out my phone,
played solitaire on it,

379
00:24:01.550 --> 00:24:06.140
fell asleep.
The exciting life of sobriety,

380
00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:12.530
you know,
it's hard to was I watched the Kentucky Derby.
Um,

381
00:24:13.610 --> 00:24:16.550
I would have won money cause I always bet on that white haired guys horse.

382
00:24:16.850 --> 00:24:20.750
Cause he's,
he's just a man.
He's the bill Belicheck of that shit.
And a,

383
00:24:20.751 --> 00:24:21.770
the year I went,

384
00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:25.730
the only time I went was that triple crown winner and he owned it.

385
00:24:26.270 --> 00:24:31.000
I won money on that one.
And uh,
I was thinking if I was there,
I,

386
00:24:31.001 --> 00:24:31.551
I always,

387
00:24:31.551 --> 00:24:36.551
I always the Michael McDonald Guy of the horse racing owners and I was just

388
00:24:37.101 --> 00:24:41.000
watching that,
that event.
And I was just,

389
00:24:42.770 --> 00:24:46.670
I was like,
why am I not sitting here right now drinking some bourbon,

390
00:24:47.270 --> 00:24:49.070
smoking a cigar,
right.

391
00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:52.880
Watching it through my front window with the volume turned up.

392
00:24:53.450 --> 00:24:57.080
She can't smoke a cigar in the house,
but I didn't do it.

393
00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:00.950
I just sat there,
you know,

394
00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:06.080
I bought one of those TRX bands,
you know,
I'm going to go on the Internet,

395
00:25:06.081 --> 00:25:09.950
still have my custom workout,
you know,
uh,

396
00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:12.700
my shoulder feels really good to really strong.
Uh,

397
00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:16.790
I still haven't done a pull up and like two years.
Uh Oh actually,
no,
I did.

398
00:25:16.791 --> 00:25:20.930
And then reinjured it,
you know,
six months ago.
So now rehabbing it back.

399
00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:24.800
So now I'm trying to go nice and frigging slow.
I got these bands.

400
00:25:24.801 --> 00:25:27.170
Now I'm back into doing yoga.

401
00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:32.340
I'm not fucking j good or not smoking and outboard shit mice there.

402
00:25:32.390 --> 00:25:35.990
I set it.
I'm fucking bored shitless.

403
00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:39.320
I like people who are sober.
How the fuck

404
00:25:41.260 --> 00:25:45.400
you know,
you know what?
I actually finally I bought an external,

405
00:25:45.430 --> 00:25:50.350
a little CD player to plug in so I could finally do my,
uh,

406
00:25:51.340 --> 00:25:56.230
my Rosetta Stone French and um,
I've been doing that.
Then of course,

407
00:25:56.231 --> 00:25:57.064
you know,

408
00:25:58.440 --> 00:25:58.670
<v 0>okay.</v>

409
00:25:58.670 --> 00:26:03.590
<v 1>My wife helps me set the fucking thing up and then I,
uh,
you know,</v>

410
00:26:05.810 --> 00:26:06.411
it's working,

411
00:26:06.411 --> 00:26:09.320
I'm having a great time and then I go to use it again and of course it won't

412
00:26:09.321 --> 00:26:11.270
fucking work.
It doesn't recognize anything.

413
00:26:11.271 --> 00:26:14.810
I don't know how to open it up and it's just a fucking pain in the ass.

414
00:26:14.811 --> 00:26:17.450
So hopefully at some point she'll take some time out of our day,
but anyways,

415
00:26:17.451 --> 00:26:20.840
I'm going to polish up on that shit and try to do an hour or two every single

416
00:26:20.841 --> 00:26:22.880
day right up until I get over to France.

417
00:26:23.210 --> 00:26:27.470
I just want to get a little bit better with my shit.
But,
uh,
you know,

418
00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:29.420
at some point I gotta,
I gotta I gotta learn,

419
00:26:29.421 --> 00:26:32.780
I gotta become fluent in French because I just think a fucking moron like me

420
00:26:33.050 --> 00:26:35.030
knowing how to speak French,
it's just something,

421
00:26:35.090 --> 00:26:39.740
it's too funny to not do it right.
Um,
okay.

422
00:26:40.790 --> 00:26:43.980
I've actually ordered kids French books and I'm reading them to my daughter.

423
00:26:43.981 --> 00:26:45.390
Those are great cause I'm sick of like,

424
00:26:45.391 --> 00:26:48.840
well how did I learn how to read English and speak it?
You know,

425
00:26:48.841 --> 00:26:52.680
I had those little books being in Sandy.
Sandy had been,
remember them.

426
00:26:52.710 --> 00:26:56.340
Did they still have those fucking books?
They were like these dogs.

427
00:26:57.030 --> 00:27:01.470
That's what that is really is one of the most fascinating things ever is

428
00:27:01.471 --> 00:27:02.550
learning how to read.

429
00:27:02.670 --> 00:27:05.580
And you're a kid so you don't really remember like somebody like teaches you how

430
00:27:05.581 --> 00:27:09.680
to fucking read.
All right,

431
00:27:09.681 --> 00:27:14.270
let me see sandy and being,
they were a dog and a cat.

432
00:27:16.660 --> 00:27:19.870
See this man,
I'm going back 45 years,

433
00:27:20.980 --> 00:27:25.850
Shani and being books.
I swear to God,
if I see these,

434
00:27:25.851 --> 00:27:27.710
this is going to freak me out to see these books.

435
00:27:30.340 --> 00:27:32.330
And of course it's not coming up.
Come on you.

436
00:27:33.130 --> 00:27:35.310
I the slowest goddamn Internet ever.

437
00:27:38.890 --> 00:27:43.860
Oh,
they don't even have them anymore.
Oh,

438
00:27:43.861 --> 00:27:46.230
Stanley being some guys,
Stanley Bing wrote a book,

439
00:27:46.231 --> 00:27:48.350
a hundred bullshit jobs and how to get them.

440
00:27:51.870 --> 00:27:56.380
That is fucking hilarious.
Why the hell would you do that?
Why?

441
00:27:56.381 --> 00:28:01.250
Why would you,
oh my God.
Look at this book.

442
00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:05.720
The Ben,
the Bernstein bears in the mean drunk

443
00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:10.090
and is uh,
does a bear,
I swear to God,

444
00:28:10.091 --> 00:28:14.380
wearing a wife beater holding a bat and looks like a bottle of Jack Daniels.

445
00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:20.860
This is why you got to love the Internet.
I'm looking up a kid's book

446
00:28:22.850 --> 00:28:27.850
and I find a hundred bullshit jobs and how to get them in the Bernstein bears.

447
00:28:31.090 --> 00:28:33.470
Am I saying that right?
And the mean drunk

448
00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:42.920
Bingo.
Crosby.
Hannah,
some bugs bunny one.
All right.
Sorry.
What the fuck mean?

449
00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:45.830
You guys are literally listened to me surf the Goddamn Internet.
Um,

450
00:28:47.210 --> 00:28:50.330
I've been doing a bunch of standup and popping in a bunch of places out here

451
00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:55.840
getting ready for the gigs I have coming up that I do not deserve to be doing in

452
00:28:56.211 --> 00:28:59.030
Ireland and in London,
Dublin in London.

453
00:28:59.060 --> 00:29:03.680
So I'm going to make sure I'm beyond on my game when I do those things.
I have a,

454
00:29:04.130 --> 00:29:04.460
uh,

455
00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:09.460
a run of dates coming up in San Francisco Monday,

456
00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:10.513
Tuesday,
Wednesday,
Thursday,
Friday.

457
00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:14.180
I'm going to be up there with Nate Kraig Milwaukee Bucks Fan.

458
00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:19.730
I'm not going to rub it in unless he brings it up.
Um,
and I'll be,

459
00:29:19.790 --> 00:29:21.170
I'll be up there all week,

460
00:29:22.450 --> 00:29:24.860
going to find a studio space with the drum kit.

461
00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:26.960
I'm going to fucking practice that bullshit.

462
00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:31.010
I'm be doing my French and I'm not going to be drinking and I'm not going to be

463
00:29:31.011 --> 00:29:34.550
smoking cigars.
Uh,
boy,

464
00:29:36.220 --> 00:29:38.570
I don't know.
I,
there's no fucking way I'm going to do this.

465
00:29:38.660 --> 00:29:40.460
I guess this is why people who are,
you know,

466
00:29:40.670 --> 00:29:43.570
somebody asked me that the day if I wanted to go to a meeting,

467
00:29:45.310 --> 00:29:46.870
you know what I mean?
And I was just like,
dude,

468
00:29:46.900 --> 00:29:50.530
I can't sit there with all this fucking donuts and people smoking cigarettes.

469
00:29:51.010 --> 00:29:53.980
I'm just,
you know what I mean?
I'm just not,
I'm not that,

470
00:29:55.510 --> 00:29:56.343
<v 0>you know,</v>

471
00:29:57.710 --> 00:30:01.490
<v 1>like I'm,
I mean everything I ever fucking joined,
I was like,
I'm not this,</v>

472
00:30:01.550 --> 00:30:06.530
I'm not this,
I'm liking this,
but I'm not quite this.
Even like playing drums.

473
00:30:06.531 --> 00:30:10.550
As much as I love playing drums,
I know I'm not a musician.
Like when I go,

474
00:30:10.551 --> 00:30:13.890
you see,
you know,
when you really see somebody that has the fucking gift,

475
00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:16.460
do you like,
that's what that is.
I mean,

476
00:30:16.461 --> 00:30:20.300
I can try to do this and make a really difficult life for myself.

477
00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:25.370
It wasn't until I walked into a comedy club in open Mike and I saw all those

478
00:30:25.371 --> 00:30:29.870
desperate lunatics and I'm like,
yeah,
this is,
this is me.

479
00:30:29.871 --> 00:30:31.670
I'm this,
this is what I am.

480
00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:37.090
So I went to an AA meeting,
I've gone to a couple of them.
Um,

481
00:30:37.130 --> 00:30:40.250
they were required by the fucking courts of Massachusetts.

482
00:30:40.251 --> 00:30:44.450
I was required to go to two of those in a mother against drinking and driving

483
00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:48.860
way back in the day when I got arrested for that shit back in the 80s,
you know?

484
00:30:50.530 --> 00:30:51.363
<v 0>MMM.</v>

485
00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:56.730
<v 1>And I remember sitting there listening to these fucking stories and I was just</v>

486
00:30:56.731 --> 00:30:59.190
like,
Jesus fucking Christ.

487
00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:00.880
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

488
00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:05.880
<v 1>These people would have like head wounds and wake up from head wounds or stumble</v>

489
00:31:06.311 --> 00:31:11.311
out of jail barefoot and just stumble across the street directly over to a

490
00:31:12.161 --> 00:31:15.010
liquor store.
I mean,
that is a fucking alcoholic.

491
00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:17.433
<v 0>You know,</v>

492
00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:20.500
<v 1>they need help.</v>

493
00:31:21.270 --> 00:31:21.450
<v 0>Okay.</v>

494
00:31:21.450 --> 00:31:26.040
<v 1>To Stop.
I can stop on my own.
I might just justifying all of this.</v>

495
00:31:26.070 --> 00:31:27.780
That's what I'd be in the programs could be.

496
00:31:27.781 --> 00:31:31.290
I can stop on my own and I just sit here and I'm just fucking budgets born out

497
00:31:31.291 --> 00:31:34.800
of my fucking mind.
It doesn't make any sense.
It's like I'm saying,

498
00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:37.110
that's like saying I'm never going to have ice cream ever again.

499
00:31:37.111 --> 00:31:41.250
It's like ever I could see not having it all the time,
seeing out of fat,
fuck,

500
00:31:42.030 --> 00:31:44.730
I get dad so your teeth don't rot out of your fucking head.

501
00:31:44.731 --> 00:31:49.020
I was definitely drinking too much,
but like,

502
00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:50.650
<v 0>okay,</v>

503
00:31:50.650 --> 00:31:51.850
<v 1>I'm never going to have it again.</v>

504
00:31:51.851 --> 00:31:55.180
I'm gonna go to go to the Kentucky Derby against someday.
God fucking willing.

505
00:31:56.410 --> 00:32:00.430
I'm going to go to the Kentucky Derby again and I'm going to sit there stone

506
00:32:00.431 --> 00:32:05.410
sober.
I mean,
you go into the track.

507
00:32:05.411 --> 00:32:09.650
I mean right there,
you're a degenerate.
Why not give into it?
I don't know.

508
00:32:10.150 --> 00:32:13.390
Who knows?
But I will tell you,
I do love it in the morning when I wake up.

509
00:32:14.020 --> 00:32:18.460
Clearheaded in the morning,
it might pasty stomach is nice and flat.

510
00:32:18.461 --> 00:32:22.060
I definitely,
I definitely enjoy that.
You know,
makes me a better dad.

511
00:32:23.050 --> 00:32:25.750
I always make my daughter breakfast.
That's my thing every morning,
right?

512
00:32:25.850 --> 00:32:30.150
I'd go out and I get her,
I opened the door and she goes,
hi,
am I gay?

513
00:32:30.630 --> 00:32:35.290
All right.
Excuse me.
Nice hug and a kiss.
Then,

514
00:32:35.650 --> 00:32:40.340
uh,
you know,
change or put a pajama bottoms across your eyes.
Where is she,

515
00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:45.310
where she plays that game?
Loves it.
Still loving that game.
Right.
And um,

516
00:32:46.360 --> 00:32:49.550
can I go upstairs?
She's really easy.
I cut up bananas,

517
00:32:49.551 --> 00:32:53.930
strawberries and blueberries.
Did I make her a couple of eggs scrambled?

518
00:32:55.210 --> 00:32:55.620
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

519
00:32:55.620 --> 00:32:56.250
<v 1>it's funny.</v>

520
00:32:56.250 --> 00:32:59.220
What I like to do is I like to have it all prepared before I bring her upstairs.

521
00:32:59.221 --> 00:33:02.220
Because if I do,
you know,
cause if she's just sitting there,

522
00:33:02.221 --> 00:33:06.630
she starts to get restless,
like,
you know,
where's the food?
But if I have it all,

523
00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:08.830
yeah.
Ready.
The other day I had it already,
you know,

524
00:33:08.860 --> 00:33:13.120
and I brought her up and I put her in every little chair and I put a bib on and

525
00:33:13.121 --> 00:33:16.980
all that.
And then they put the plate down already ready and everything made.

526
00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:20.300
And she just goes,
wow.
No.
She goes,
Whoa,

527
00:33:24.650 --> 00:33:29.170
it was awesome.
And she can feed herself.
Only thing I got to watch out for her,

528
00:33:29.171 --> 00:33:33.280
she,
she wolfs down food the way I do.
So I just got to make sure I'm a

529
00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:38.130
staying on her,
so I make sure I cut up everything nice and small,

530
00:33:38.820 --> 00:33:40.680
spread out the eggs.
So they cool off.

531
00:33:40.681 --> 00:33:43.920
She doesn't burn them off and then that's it.
Give her a glass of water,

532
00:33:44.150 --> 00:33:48.630
then it's all good.
Um,
so anyways,
uh,
you know,

533
00:33:49.190 --> 00:33:51.390
and I guess if I was hung over and it'd probably be a bad thing.

534
00:33:52.890 --> 00:33:53.990
So then I think to myself,

535
00:33:54.010 --> 00:33:57.210
what if I just get shit faced when I'm on the road among,

536
00:33:57.300 --> 00:33:59.820
on the road like four days a month?
That would be fine.
Right.

537
00:34:00.730 --> 00:34:03.930
What do you guys say about that?
I will.
What do you say?
Oh,

538
00:34:03.931 --> 00:34:06.810
you guys and fucking Aa and I don't drink on the plane.

539
00:34:06.870 --> 00:34:08.070
It's just after the shows.

540
00:34:09.580 --> 00:34:13.330
It's gotta be a way to do it the way I used to be able to do it,
you know?

541
00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:16.690
Do you know,
you know what to really think that that fucked me up was I,
I,

542
00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:21.700
I never used to have booze in the house.
So that's the problem.

543
00:34:21.701 --> 00:34:24.490
So when I do start drinking again,
because I am going to start drinking,

544
00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:29.350
what I'm gonna do is I'm going to finish all the liquor in my house,

545
00:34:29.980 --> 00:34:34.300
which even if I drank at a degenerate level,

546
00:34:34.301 --> 00:34:36.830
would probably take me a good six months.
So I don't,

547
00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:37.673
I don't know how I'm going to judge.

548
00:34:37.690 --> 00:34:40.960
Probably should have some people over and help them kill some of these bottles,

549
00:34:41.290 --> 00:34:45.280
but I have such good booze.
I just can't give it away to some bomb,

550
00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:46.530
you know what I mean?
Like,

551
00:34:46.530 --> 00:34:50.320
do you ever give a Cuban cigar to some guy who occasionally smokes and you just

552
00:34:50.550 --> 00:34:53.770
watch them,
which is half the whole fucking thing down.
And you know,

553
00:34:53.771 --> 00:34:57.220
you might as well give him a Dutch master.
That's the kind of booze I have.

554
00:34:57.221 --> 00:35:02.221
So what I would like to do is slowly knock out all the booze over the next five

555
00:35:04.061 --> 00:35:07.330
years that I have in the house and not replace any of the bottles.

556
00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:12.370
And then,
because I think even back in the day when I lived in New York,

557
00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:18.800
when I was living in New York and Derosa was living in New York,
um,

558
00:35:19.540 --> 00:35:22.780
I mean we used to just get fucking annihilated

559
00:35:24.310 --> 00:35:27.130
and uh,
but I never had any booze in the house.

560
00:35:28.420 --> 00:35:33.160
So in my apartment I should say.
So I think that that's,
I think that's right.

561
00:35:33.161 --> 00:35:37.860
There was the game changers when I had it at home and then had these nice

562
00:35:37.861 --> 00:35:41.010
fucking glasses.
You know,
when you really get into it,

563
00:35:41.011 --> 00:35:43.890
like this is high level booze and these high level,
like you know,

564
00:35:43.891 --> 00:35:48.870
the right glass and you get into the whole like ritual of it and you really can

565
00:35:48.871 --> 00:35:52.260
trick yourself.
That should not just be in some degenerate drinking alone.

566
00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:55.610
You know what I mean?
You'll use as a high ball glass and this is what you,

567
00:35:55.630 --> 00:35:57.420
this was also those glass.
Here's for us,

568
00:35:57.421 --> 00:36:01.560
Sam Adams beer actually have the Sam Adams classes.
You know what,

569
00:36:01.561 --> 00:36:02.940
that little lip at the top,

570
00:36:02.941 --> 00:36:05.700
like it's supposed to make the head and the hops and all of that tastes good.

571
00:36:05.701 --> 00:36:08.330
It tastes the fucking same.
You know what I mean?
That's equity.

572
00:36:08.430 --> 00:36:11.760
They do all these reissues of guitars.
You know what I mean?

573
00:36:12.060 --> 00:36:15.210
I can't tell the difference the way I play guitar,

574
00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:18.510
which I barely do anymore.
Um,

575
00:36:20.310 --> 00:36:23.310
and uh,
you know,
you could give me the greatest guitar in the world.

576
00:36:23.311 --> 00:36:25.230
I'm still going to sound like make,
which is shitty.

577
00:36:28.950 --> 00:36:33.390
So anyways,
I don't know who the fuck knows.
Um,

578
00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:37.530
but a buddy of mine's actually been listening to these tapes that,
you know,

579
00:36:37.590 --> 00:36:41.460
talk about alcohol,
not in that stupid you need to go to get help type of way,

580
00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:45.870
but they just talk about,
they just put it in a different perspective.
Um,

581
00:36:47.490 --> 00:36:50.130
I dunno,
I'm just like a streaky person.
That's all it is.

582
00:36:50.190 --> 00:36:51.270
So like when I'm not drinking,

583
00:36:51.271 --> 00:36:54.810
I don't want to drink because I don't want to ruin the streak.
Oh my God,
man.

584
00:36:54.811 --> 00:36:59.190
I've gotten like 35,
40 days here.
I'm going to start all over again.

585
00:36:59.820 --> 00:37:03.840
Let me see if I can make it to 50,
because there's a big part of me that,
um,

586
00:37:05.430 --> 00:37:10.140
you know,
we'd like to plow right through my birthday and not drink,

587
00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:12.750
but then I was like,
I'm going to be in France.

588
00:37:12.751 --> 00:37:14.430
How the fuck do you not drink when you're over there?

589
00:37:14.431 --> 00:37:15.990
I'm not gonna have a fucking glass of wine.

590
00:37:17.950 --> 00:37:22.150
Sit there like a fucking jerk off.
I Dunno.
We'll see.
Anyways.
Alright.

591
00:37:22.180 --> 00:37:25.970
Zip Recruiter,
Zip
but crewed up.

592
00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:31.870
Talk about the challenge of finding great talent and how the way you went about

593
00:37:32.001 --> 00:37:35.210
it just did not work.
I was inefficient.
Well,

594
00:37:35.211 --> 00:37:37.700
I'd love to tell you that that was a problem.
But,
uh,

595
00:37:38.540 --> 00:37:41.390
I actually got lucky for somebody who was a fan of my podcast,

596
00:37:41.391 --> 00:37:45.530
reached out to me by the name of Andrew [inaudible] and I've been working with

597
00:37:45.531 --> 00:37:46.730
them ever since,
you know.

598
00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:48.620
<v 0>Okay.</v>

599
00:37:48.620 --> 00:37:49.490
<v 1>And He's been great.</v>

600
00:37:50.390 --> 00:37:54.410
So I don't know what to tell you to separate zip recruiter knew there was a

601
00:37:54.411 --> 00:37:55.370
smarter way.
Well,
look,

602
00:37:55.371 --> 00:37:58.310
obviously if I actually ran a business where I needed more than one frigging

603
00:37:58.311 --> 00:38:00.620
employee,
okay.

604
00:38:00.621 --> 00:38:05.621
And I don't want to waste time bringing people in and sitting there talking to

605
00:38:05.901 --> 00:38:08.780
them and trying to find out if they came from divorce or you know,

606
00:38:08.781 --> 00:38:13.781
how they did in school or go go check their Goddamn Facebook page to see what

607
00:38:13.941 --> 00:38:16.970
they've liked or not liked.
Um,

608
00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:21.710
this seems the easiest way to do it.
And you can just sift,

609
00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:26.030
sift through a entire,
the entire nation of qualified candidates,

610
00:38:26.690 --> 00:38:28.640
while Ziprecruiter knew that there was a smarter way.

611
00:38:28.670 --> 00:38:33.510
So they built a platform that finds the right job,
job candidates for you,
chip

612
00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:40.750
learns what you're looking for,
identifies people with the right experience.

613
00:38:40.751 --> 00:38:42.790
And invites them to apply to your job.

614
00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:47.410
These invitations that have revolutionized how you find your next hire.

615
00:38:47.590 --> 00:38:51.250
In fact,
80% of employees who post jobs on zip

616
00:38:52.930 --> 00:38:55.780
get a quality candidate through the site.

617
00:38:55.870 --> 00:38:59.470
It just one day and zip recruiter doesn't stop there.

618
00:38:59.471 --> 00:39:02.710
They even spotlight the strongest applications you received,

619
00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:06.280
so you never miss a great match.
That's right.
Oh,
sorry.

620
00:39:06.281 --> 00:39:08.670

00:40:28.100 --> 00:40:31.670
Evidentaly I got all these cheap pairs that look terrible.
No,

I have nice sunglasses.
I have a couple cheapos and I fucking ate those.

641
00:40:36.650 --> 00:40:40.250
But every time I buy a $200 pair,
I feel like I get ripped off.

642
00:40:40.251 --> 00:40:44.660
That's not the truth.
Every time I spent $200,
I ended up fucking losing it.

643
00:40:44.930 --> 00:40:47.720
Or sitting on them are dropping them on the pavement.

644
00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:52.970
Well our friends at movement.
Yeah,

they kind of felt the same way.

645
00:40:52.971 --> 00:40:56.300
So they thought screw it.
Oh,

This is the black Tux.

662
00:42:00.890 --> 00:42:04.700
These are the Tuxedos that those people on Ohio state were wearing when they

sold their jerseys and it got put on suspension.

664
00:42:08.390 --> 00:42:12.920
Wedding season is upon us.
Oh that's right.
It is.

665
00:42:13.490 --> 00:42:17.750
You're going to be doing it big and going out to all of your buddies weddings.

666
00:42:17.751 --> 00:42:19.790
I gotta be honest with you.
Weddings are actually great now.

667
00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:23.150
Wedding sucked when I was a kid cause he was still like,

668
00:42:23.151 --> 00:42:26.270
people weren't making them individually.
They just were all the same.

669
00:42:26.271 --> 00:42:30.560
They will long and fucking boring.
And you were like,
when can we get to the bar?

670
00:42:31.430 --> 00:42:34.010
Uh,
when you're bringing a date,
you want to look fresh,

671
00:42:34.190 --> 00:42:39.180
but it has to be convenient.
That's where the black tux comes in to it.

672
00:42:39.190 --> 00:42:41.990
You're not even in the wedding and you're going to wear a Tuxedo to the wedding.

673
00:42:41.991 --> 00:42:44.480
That's fucking hilarious.
Going out dress the groom.

674
00:42:44.600 --> 00:42:46.310
I like the way these people are thinking.

675
00:42:46.550 --> 00:42:51.110
The black tops has awesome suits and Tuxedos and all kinds of styles and you

676
00:42:51.111 --> 00:42:53.530
rent them online.
Oh I get it.
You gonna wear a suit.
The,

677
00:42:53.690 --> 00:42:57.980
the black Tux offers the kinds of suits and Tuxedos styles that would normally

678
00:42:57.981 --> 00:43:02.690
be wildly expensive to buy.
You might only wear it once like

679
00:43:04.850 --> 00:43:07.040
the Emerald Shawl Tuxedo.
It's Funky,
it's cool.

680
00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:11.750
But how many times you get aware and Emerald Green Tuxedo with the Black Tux?

681
00:43:11.990 --> 00:43:16.370
You can,
you can do you and blow it out for you.
One big event,

682
00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:19.730
you're going to wear an amber or green Tuxedo to somebody else's wedding.

683
00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:23.990
You know,
when you do that,
you do that.
When you,
you used to be fucking the bride,

684
00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:25.513
you know,

685
00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:30.520
and she's doing that Douche move of inviting an old boyfriend to the wedding.

686
00:43:31.240 --> 00:43:34.340
Brigid's friends.
We're at a good place.
By the way,
as a man,

687
00:43:34.341 --> 00:43:38.090
you can not allow that to happen.
You cannot allow that to happen.

688
00:43:39.320 --> 00:43:39.751
I mean,
I,

689
00:43:39.751 --> 00:43:42.530
I would actually question whether I would even marry the person if they're

690
00:43:42.531 --> 00:43:47.360
inviting an old boyfriend,
uh,
with the Black Tux free home,
try on,

691
00:43:47.361 --> 00:43:51.650
you can see the fit and feel the quality of the suit months before your event.

692
00:43:51.980 --> 00:43:52.191
Well,

693
00:43:52.191 --> 00:43:55.700
you better make sure you eat well if you're going to try it on that early after

694
00:43:55.701 --> 00:43:59.390
ordering your sue will arrive 14 days before your event.

695
00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:02.180
If anything is less than perfect.
If you put it on a few pounds,

696
00:44:02.181 --> 00:44:05.540
it took a few off.
I guess the Black Tux will send you a replacement right away.

697
00:44:05.810 --> 00:44:06.643
Oh,
that's cool.

698
00:44:06.930 --> 00:44:11.390
I remember I'll simple returns are where it turned heads than send it back three

699

because uh,
you know,

715
00:45:14.401 --> 00:45:16.650
whenever I send out my postage,
which by the way,

you got to see the poster for my tour coming up,
which is simply called 50.

All right,
the big five o people.
Um,

Um,

721
00:45:38.020 --> 00:45:40.890
and I actually am not going to be using stamps.com for that just because the

722
00:45:41.300 --> 00:45:43.020
company's going to be sending it out themselves.
However,

723
00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:45.720
when they send me the rest of the posters and I,

724
00:45:45.721 --> 00:45:47.280
when I do Minnesota and all that,

725
00:45:47.281 --> 00:45:51.360
I will be using stamps.com and right then I'm a moron if I can figure it out.

726
00:45:51.361 --> 00:45:53.580
So can you in right now,
you too can enjoy stamps.

731
00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:13.520
I will be coming out after the show to take pictures and sign your posts or

732

something like that.
I have not done in fucking years.
Um,

733
00:46:18.080 --> 00:46:21.270
I'm gonna do that again because a,

734
00:46:21.271 --> 00:46:24.690
I appreciate you guys coming out.
It is a big birthday.

735
00:46:25.860 --> 00:46:29.640
Why not?
You know,
and God knows I'm not in the back drinking.

736
00:46:31.570 --> 00:46:32.160
<v 3>Whew.</v>

737
00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:36.990
<v 1>Although I think once I get through Dublin and once I get through London,</v>

738
00:46:39.060 --> 00:46:42.870
I think,
you know,
that's would be June 6th.
I think that's the night.

739
00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:47.220
I might actually have a little,
uh,
a little stumped and who knows?
I don't know.

740
00:46:47.460 --> 00:46:50.280
But you don't bring in my whole family over there.
I can't be hung over.

741
00:46:51.060 --> 00:46:54.480
That's another reason why my daughter's the best.
Right?
She keeps me sober.

742
00:46:55.130 --> 00:46:58.110
All right,
hang on one second.

743
00:46:58.111 --> 00:47:00.300
I have to look something up here because now we're going to get into the

744
00:47:00.301 --> 00:47:05.301
questions this week and I'm disappointed.

745
00:47:05.641 --> 00:47:06.570
Somebody bringing

746
00:47:09.170 --> 00:47:12.930
some point that somebody bringing up above guns and they're doing it in the

747
00:47:12.931 --> 00:47:16.710
usual way that people do it on the Internet where they insult the other person.

748
00:47:17.670 --> 00:47:22.170
And I just want to make sure I have the definition of something up here.
Okay.

749
00:47:22.440 --> 00:47:25.770
Bullshit.
Ar 15 response to goat guy.

750
00:47:27.900 --> 00:47:32.860
For those of you who don't listen all the time.
Um,
you know,

751
00:47:32.861 --> 00:47:36.670
I,
I,
you know,
there's a whole gun debate.
Why do you need an Ar 15?

752
00:47:36.671 --> 00:47:40.390
So I was asking people that have a,
our 15th.
I said,
why do you have one?

753
00:47:41.120 --> 00:47:43.180
Don't give me that bullshit about fucking,
you know,

754
00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:47.580
home defense and all of that crap.
I Made Jesus Christ.
I mean,
you,
you could be,

755
00:47:47.610 --> 00:47:49.750
I mean,
you could literally have a 22

756
00:47:51.350 --> 00:47:54.130
who the fuck anybody want to get shot by a fucking 22?

757
00:47:54.790 --> 00:47:57.610
I would have a 22 I did a whole bit on that just because I don't want to fucking

758
00:47:57.611 --> 00:47:58.720
blow my ear drums out.

759
00:47:59.570 --> 00:48:00.403
<v 0>Okay.</v>

760
00:48:00.960 --> 00:48:02.610
<v 1>I mean,
a fucking BB gun.</v>

761
00:48:03.920 --> 00:48:04.640
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

762
00:48:04.640 --> 00:48:06.740
<v 1>Yeah.
With one of those little fucking CO2 cartridges,</v>

763
00:48:06.741 --> 00:48:08.420
you shoot somebody in the fucking face with that.

764
00:48:08.421 --> 00:48:09.620
They know what they're gonna do.

765
00:48:09.730 --> 00:48:11.720
They're gonna keep going to keep walking through that.

766
00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:15.260
Then go down the street and just don't have to worry about anything when they

767
00:48:15.261 --> 00:48:18.140
walk into that house.
I don't know.
Anyways,
but you know,

768
00:48:18.141 --> 00:48:20.600
or to fight off the government.
That's my,
another famous want.
No,

769
00:48:20.601 --> 00:48:21.860
that's another my other favorite one.

770
00:48:21.861 --> 00:48:25.040
You're going to fight off the government with your fucking semiautomatic gun

771
00:48:25.041 --> 00:48:28.740
here.
The whole government.
You're going to fight them all off.
Um,

772
00:48:28.760 --> 00:48:32.350
I got a lot of bullets,
mother fucker.
All right.
So anyways,

773
00:48:32.351 --> 00:48:36.420
so this guy ends up writing in saying that he,
uh,

774
00:48:36.470 --> 00:48:38.990
was a sheep farmer or whatever,
goat farm or something like that.

775
00:48:39.170 --> 00:48:43.370
Go farmer and he uses the milk to make a,
um,

776
00:48:45.710 --> 00:48:48.050
Parmigiano Reggiano and he also your some whatever the fuck he used two

777
00:48:48.051 --> 00:48:51.050
different types of cheese.
I forget what the other kid,

778
00:48:51.051 --> 00:48:54.570
but both delicious types of cheese and there's all these coyotes,

779
00:48:54.720 --> 00:48:58.190
they hunt hunted packs and he's shooting at a moving target and it just made

780
00:48:58.191 --> 00:49:02.450
fucking sense.
So then somebody else wrote back,
God,
that's bullshit.

781
00:49:03.320 --> 00:49:07.910
Just get some fucking dogs.
They'll fight off the coyotes,
coyotes,
a cowards,

782
00:49:07.940 --> 00:49:12.270
this guy's full of shit.
And to be randomly killing coyotes like that is,

783
00:49:12.620 --> 00:49:13.700
you know,
mean and all that.

784
00:49:15.560 --> 00:49:19.520
So this guy is responding to the person that responded to the guy because I was

785
00:49:19.521 --> 00:49:22.310
impressed with that guy when he said that,
this is why I use it.
I'll go with,

786
00:49:22.430 --> 00:49:25.070
oh shit,
that makes sense.
And I like that cheese.
So God bless you.

787
00:49:25.940 --> 00:49:28.550
Kill those coyotes.
Right?
Um,

788
00:49:28.610 --> 00:49:31.730
so my name's this guys responding to the person that said that that guy's still

789
00:49:31.731 --> 00:49:34.370
didn't need the gun.
He could just get a couple of dogs.
So anyways,
he said,

790
00:49:34.371 --> 00:49:34.761
hey bill,

791
00:49:34.761 --> 00:49:39.761
I'd like to say to the guys response about just by dogs instead of an ar 15 does

792
00:49:41.331 --> 00:49:45.320
not know what the fuck he's talking about.
First of all,
it's not a machine gun.

793
00:49:45.500 --> 00:49:48.800
You dumb cunt.
It's semiautomatic rifle.

794
00:49:48.980 --> 00:49:53.270
Meaning you pulled the trigger once in one bullet fires.
Okay,

795
00:49:53.300 --> 00:49:54.980
now do you see how he just made his point?

796
00:49:57.180 --> 00:50:01.030
It's not a machine gun.
You dumb cunt.

797
00:50:01.660 --> 00:50:04.540
It's a semiautomatic rifle.
You should say it's not a machine gun.

798
00:50:04.541 --> 00:50:09.010
It's semiautomatic.
And then you should explain what semiotic Madec meets.

799
00:50:10.180 --> 00:50:11.013
All right.

800
00:50:11.070 --> 00:50:15.100
Semiautomatic doesn't just mean that you just pulled the trigger in one bullet

801
00:50:15.101 --> 00:50:18.700
fires because then literally a fucking 38 is semiautomatic.

802
00:50:19.510 --> 00:50:23.740
Doesn't that mean like you can,
you can actually pull the trigger quickly faster

803
00:50:25.360 --> 00:50:26.920
where it won't get jammed or something like,

804
00:50:27.140 --> 00:50:29.750
I mean there's something different between just some fucking revolver,

805
00:50:30.110 --> 00:50:33.500
semiautomatic in fully automatic.
I don't know shit about guns,
right,

806
00:50:33.501 --> 00:50:38.500
but isn't there.
So I looked up semiautomatic firearm.
It says this,

807
00:50:38.550 --> 00:50:41.690
without calling anybody a dumb cunt,
he just not informed.

808
00:50:41.691 --> 00:50:43.430
There's a lot of information in the world.

809
00:50:43.610 --> 00:50:45.260
You can't have it all between your ears,

810
00:50:46.220 --> 00:50:51.220
semiautomatic firearm or a self-loading firearm is one that not only fires a

811
00:50:51.801 --> 00:50:56.801
bullet each time the trigger is pulled but also performs all steps necessary to

812
00:50:57.321 --> 00:51:00.440
prepare it to discharge.
Again,

813
00:51:01.100 --> 00:51:04.700
assuming cartridges remain in the firearm feed device,

814
00:51:04.730 --> 00:51:09.730
typically this includes extracting and ejecting the spent cartridge case from

815
00:51:11.331 --> 00:51:12.470
the firing chamber.

816
00:51:13.400 --> 00:51:17.780
Reconquering the firing mechanism and loading a new cartridge into the fire

817
00:51:17.870 --> 00:51:21.140
firing chamber to fire again,
the trigger is released

818
00:51:23.620 --> 00:51:27.970
to fire again.
The trigger is released and repressed again.
All right,

819
00:51:28.060 --> 00:51:31.900
so now let me ask you this.
So is is a 38

820
00:51:33.750 --> 00:51:37.620
because the revolver turns,
is that considered semiautomatic?

821
00:51:38.670 --> 00:51:39.960
Now I'm just confused.

822
00:51:43.590 --> 00:51:48.440
Semiautomatic,
let me look up.
Let me look.
Let me look this up.

823
00:51:50.230 --> 00:51:54.990
It's a revolver.
You know it's funny.
People were in the gun right now.

824
00:51:54.991 --> 00:51:57.870
The amount of people that are listening to me like I'm a fucking moron.

825
00:51:57.900 --> 00:52:01.200
Like this means that they're better at math.
It's like I don't know guns.

826
00:52:01.201 --> 00:52:02.400
I don't know anything about this shit.

827
00:52:02.850 --> 00:52:05.450
If you didn't know anything about drums I would make fun of you cause you didn't

828
00:52:05.540 --> 00:52:09.300
want to fucking high hat.
Was it a revolver?
Semiautomatic,

829
00:52:12.330 --> 00:52:16.640
let's see here.
Any hits search and it takes two hours.

830
00:52:18.980 --> 00:52:23.980
A revolver which uses multiple chambers and a single barrel and a derringer

831
00:52:24.770 --> 00:52:26.780
which uses multiple chambers in multiple barriers.

832
00:52:26.781 --> 00:52:28.970
Also fire one round per trigger pull,

833
00:52:29.210 --> 00:52:33.560
but achieved this in different ways and as such are not classified as being

834
00:52:33.561 --> 00:52:38.350
semiautomatic,
semiautomatic pistols.

835
00:52:39.720 --> 00:52:41.290
You semi automatic pistol

836
00:52:43.310 --> 00:52:47.570
is a type of pistol that is semiautomatic.
I swear to God.

837
00:52:47.600 --> 00:52:49.100
That's the first statement.

838
00:52:50.030 --> 00:52:55.030
Meaning it uses the energy of the fired cartridge to cycle the action of the

839
00:52:56.151 --> 00:53:00.800
firearm and advanced the next available cartridge into position.

840
00:53:00.890 --> 00:53:01.611
So basically,

841
00:53:01.611 --> 00:53:05.720
if I don't have some revolutionary war thing that it's just like I put a bullet

842
00:53:05.721 --> 00:53:07.850
in shoot and then put another bullet in,

843
00:53:08.030 --> 00:53:11.180
or I don't have to do that cocking thing that you always see with the sniper

844
00:53:11.181 --> 00:53:12.014
rifles.

845
00:53:13.260 --> 00:53:13.860
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

846
00:53:13.860 --> 00:53:16.000
<v 1>All right.
So this is sort of a basic gun that,</v>

847
00:53:17.040 --> 00:53:17.580
<v 0>yeah,</v>

848
00:53:17.580 --> 00:53:21.090
<v 1>it's just like a car with power windows and power brakes,
power steering,</v>

849
00:53:21.091 --> 00:53:22.440
like most cars have that now.

850
00:53:23.070 --> 00:53:26.280
Is that basically what you're saying when you were calling guy at dumb cunt,

851
00:53:27.630 --> 00:53:30.330
he's not a dumb cunt.
I bet that deck wanted this game.

852
00:53:30.331 --> 00:53:34.860
What if he's a veterinarian?
It doesn't mean you're a dumb cunt.
All right.

853
00:53:36.310 --> 00:53:39.510
He should have said you uninformed comment.
How about that?
Can we,

854
00:53:39.630 --> 00:53:42.300
can we meet in the middle there and can still call him a cunt,

855
00:53:42.301 --> 00:53:44.880
but just used to correct an adjective?

856
00:53:47.130 --> 00:53:47.963
<v 0>MMM.</v>

857
00:53:48.390 --> 00:53:51.330
<v 1>Anyways,
just like most rifles and hand guns these days.
Oh,</v>

858
00:53:51.450 --> 00:53:55.380
you actually explained it to me if I considered continued reading.
Okay.
Uh,

859
00:53:55.440 --> 00:53:59.160
first of all,
it's not a machine gun.
You'd dump con it's a semiautomatic rifle.

860
00:53:59.610 --> 00:54:02.190
May you pull the trigger once in one bullet fires.

861
00:54:02.430 --> 00:54:06.900
Just like most rifle in hand guns these days right off the bat.
You know,

862
00:54:06.901 --> 00:54:10.920
this guy doesn't know what he's talking about and probably never shot a gun in

863
00:54:10.921 --> 00:54:15.810
his life.
Fair enough.
That's all good.
I usually wouldn't be this hostile,

864
00:54:15.960 --> 00:54:19.740
but hey,
I had a few drinks and I'm passionate about this subject.
All right,

865
00:54:19.741 --> 00:54:22.130
fair enough.
Uh,
anyway,

866
00:54:22.170 --> 00:54:27.170
I believe his argument was to buy a fleet of dogs to protect your livestock.

867
00:54:28.051 --> 00:54:32.610
He didn't say a fleet.
He said,
you know,
I get like two or three.

868
00:54:33.660 --> 00:54:35.550
He said,
get the fuck Outta here.
You know,

869
00:54:35.551 --> 00:54:38.790
expensive train dogs are to protect your livestock.

870
00:54:39.230 --> 00:54:43.620
I'm well do you,
are you just drunk at a bar of throwing this out?

871
00:54:44.520 --> 00:54:49.380
I make Christ purebred German shepherds are eight to $900 around here.

872
00:54:49.980 --> 00:54:52.620
Now you're a moron.
No one's getting that German shepherd.

873
00:54:52.780 --> 00:54:57.490
Did you get like a fucking cheap dog era?
Uh,
uh,

874
00:54:58.040 --> 00:55:01.200
Christ one of my buddies as one of those dogs,
they're smart as shit.

875
00:55:03.310 --> 00:55:06.640
I forget the name of the dog.
You wouldn't get seen.

876
00:55:06.641 --> 00:55:11.150
And now you don't know about dogs.
He had dumb cunt.
You uninformed cut.

877
00:55:11.950 --> 00:55:14.430
God knows what a fucking fleet of dogs costs.

878
00:55:14.440 --> 00:55:18.370
Not to mention the food and attention.
You have to give him a Ar.

879
00:55:18.850 --> 00:55:21.700
15 prices are going down every day.
And with Amma,

880
00:55:21.701 --> 00:55:26.230
well under 50 cents around,
you'd have to be a dumb ass.

881
00:55:26.950 --> 00:55:31.720
Oh,
Jesus.
Parentheses or liberal not to use this.
All right.

882
00:55:31.721 --> 00:55:34.300
And right there,
your whole argument is out the window.

883
00:55:36.660 --> 00:55:41.660
Anybody who classifies all conservatives or Republicans are all liberals and

884
00:55:41.991 --> 00:55:45.930
Democrats is morons right there.
You know what I mean?

885
00:55:47.040 --> 00:55:47.230
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

886
00:55:47.230 --> 00:55:49.870
<v 1>That's kind of like what I was doing earlier when I was talking about how bad</v>

887
00:55:49.871 --> 00:55:54.310
the officiating was.
Yeah.
Against the Bruins.
However,
I did bring up that,

888
00:55:54.311 --> 00:55:55.144
you know,

889
00:55:55.160 --> 00:55:58.660
Marshawn should've got a fucking misconduct for taking that guy's knees up.

890
00:56:00.340 --> 00:56:02.980
Um,
and I did say that straight across the board.
It was,

891
00:56:03.010 --> 00:56:06.790
it's been really fucking unprofessional.
Um,
however,

892
00:56:06.820 --> 00:56:10.360
but if I were to just sit there and say,
all the bad calls went against us.

893
00:56:11.770 --> 00:56:14.010
I mean,
I don't know.
I would beat that.
I mean,
what,
what,

894
00:56:14.290 --> 00:56:17.170
what kind of fucking world kind of do a match or liberal.

895
00:56:20.320 --> 00:56:24.370
And I just made him out to all be Southern's.
Like everybody south is a dumb ass,

896
00:56:24.371 --> 00:56:29.200
which is not true.
Mark Twain,
you know what I mean?

897
00:56:29.230 --> 00:56:32.470
That guy was so smart.
He wrote all those books in Kentucky,
Fried Chicken,

898
00:56:32.471 --> 00:56:36.910
had that guy dressed.
Just like in conclusion,
he said,
in conclusion,

899
00:56:36.911 --> 00:56:40.360
as if he sees he's made this great argument,
uh,

900
00:56:40.361 --> 00:56:44.470
I think there is a huge lack of education on firearms in the u s today.

901
00:56:45.180 --> 00:56:50.160
And he actually wrote in the US today,
he didn't capitalize the u s um,

902
00:56:50.260 --> 00:56:53.200
I would 100% agree with that.
At the end of the day,

903
00:56:53.230 --> 00:56:57.100
the Ar 15 is the most effective tool for a lot of jobs.

904
00:56:57.760 --> 00:57:02.110
A PSA saw you in Nashville,
your final bit fucking killed.

905
00:57:02.170 --> 00:57:04.210
Love you and go fuck yourself sincerely.

906
00:57:04.420 --> 00:57:08.890
Your freedom loving fans in Nashville.
Ah,
dude.

907
00:57:08.891 --> 00:57:13.150
You know something?
I gotta be honest with you.
I agreed with your points,

908
00:57:13.570 --> 00:57:18.310
but when you said dumb ass or liberal and the fact that you said freedom,

909
00:57:18.311 --> 00:57:21.460
loving,
like who doesn't love to be free?

910
00:57:22.960 --> 00:57:23.680
You know what I mean?

911
00:57:23.680 --> 00:57:27.670
Are you another one of these peace people that thinks that isis is a major

912
00:57:27.671 --> 00:57:31.990
threat to a first world country with their no plane,
no boat,

913
00:57:32.890 --> 00:57:36.130
no uniform,
no real weaponry,
modern weaponry,

914
00:57:36.131 --> 00:57:40.330
fucking army.
You know what I mean?

915
00:57:42.030 --> 00:57:42.090
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

916
00:57:42.090 --> 00:57:45.730
<v 1>Do you think if isis was,
uh,
living in the bad lands,</v>

917
00:57:45.750 --> 00:57:50.750
we would even waste a fucking second of our goddamn tax dollars to try and stop

918
00:57:50.941 --> 00:57:51.774
them?

919
00:57:52.770 --> 00:57:56.220
This plenty of fucking cops out there that just not sitting on top of a bunch of

920
00:57:56.221 --> 00:58:00.360
fucking oil freedom.
Loving fucking,
you know,

921
00:58:00.361 --> 00:58:04.050
something you've really,
you've really lost me there.

922
00:58:05.910 --> 00:58:09.600
I mean,
if you don't agree with me,
I guess she just don't like freedom.

923
00:58:12.030 --> 00:58:12.690
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

924
00:58:12.690 --> 00:58:14.710
<v 1>Oh boy.
What I,</v>

925
00:58:14.750 --> 00:58:19.650
the amount of people that are drinking that fucking Koolaid 15 years into this

926
00:58:19.651 --> 00:58:23.960
fucking thing,
it's a liberation.

927
00:58:24.560 --> 00:58:28.520
They have weapons of mass destruction.
They've changed it like 90 fucking times.

928
00:58:28.700 --> 00:58:31.940
And I'm so sick of the fact that you can't criticize what the fuck were those

929
00:58:31.941 --> 00:58:36.440
fucking broke ass console over there are going to bankrupt us.

930
00:58:37.640 --> 00:58:40.610
How long can you spend $700 billion a fucking year.

931
00:58:40.670 --> 00:58:42.890
At some point we're going to have to pay for that.

932
00:58:42.980 --> 00:58:45.500
I'm going to have to pay for it.
You're going to pay for it.
Our kids,

933
00:58:45.830 --> 00:58:47.090
their kids and all of that.

934
00:58:48.400 --> 00:58:53.400
Jesus fucking Christ over a bunch of jerk offs with a bag of m eighties

935
00:58:55.480 --> 00:58:56.080
<v 0>yeah.</v>

936
00:58:56.080 --> 00:58:59.140
<v 1>Unfucking believable.
Unbelievable.
You know why we're over there.</v>

937
00:58:59.141 --> 00:59:02.440
Saddam knew why we went over there.
He lit it on fire before we got there,

938
00:59:02.560 --> 00:59:05.740
but you can't say that anymore in this country because if you do,

939
00:59:05.741 --> 00:59:09.700
that means you're in Isis or you're a socialist or some shit like that.

940
00:59:09.701 --> 00:59:11.320
It's just fucking,
it's unbelievable.

941
00:59:12.280 --> 00:59:16.460
It's unfucking believable be while this place is going to hell in a handbasket

942
00:59:16.660 --> 00:59:18.370
with a nationwide heroin epidemic,

943
00:59:18.550 --> 00:59:23.300
our food supply is fucking poison and the got the houses back so they can cook

944
00:59:23.301 --> 00:59:27.140
the economy again.
All of that is fine.
All of that is fine,

945
00:59:27.380 --> 00:59:31.670
but if you tell jokes that have fucking
presidential,

946
00:59:31.671 --> 00:59:36.050
whatever the fuck that is,
the whole goddamn world stops.
All right.
This girl,

947
00:59:37.130 --> 00:59:40.850
ah,
Billy blowfish,
love you,
Billy blue.
I like that.

948
00:59:41.150 --> 00:59:44.960
Love your podcast.
I've been listening to it every time I'm in the car.

949
00:59:45.290 --> 00:59:49.430
Driving to and from work definitely makes my commute better.
Listen,

950
00:59:49.431 --> 00:59:53.750
I'm a 22 year old guy and I've been talking to this girl who has a kid.

951
00:59:54.050 --> 00:59:56.480
Now I know what you're thinking.
What the fuck is going through?

952
00:59:56.481 --> 00:59:58.520
Your stupid fucking had a,

953
00:59:58.521 --> 01:00:01.760
but the problem is is I think I really liked this girl.

954
01:00:01.790 --> 01:00:03.110
I don't think that's a problem.

955
01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:07.730
As long as you're willing to take on the responsibilities of that relationship

956
01:00:07.731 --> 01:00:11.210
is nothing wrong with it.
And I,
one thing I forgot to mention,

957
01:00:11.870 --> 01:00:16.340
I haven't even met her in person yet.
Ah,
okay.
I just,

958
01:00:16.370 --> 01:00:21.080
I just dropped the microphone on that one.
I'm supposed to meet her.

959
01:00:21.410 --> 01:00:22.850
I was supposed to meet up with there.
Okay.

960
01:00:22.851 --> 01:00:27.170
I just thought you was stalking her on social media.
I'm supposed to meet her.

961
01:00:29.570 --> 01:00:32.930
I'm supposed to go meet her up this Saturday.
Is that a new expression?

962
01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:36.500
I think you said you think he meant to say meet up with there this Saturday

963
01:00:36.500 --> 01:00:39.380
night after work and I'm not sure what will happen.

964
01:00:40.190 --> 01:00:44.930
The thing is she's exactly like me.
She's vegetarian,

965
01:00:45.110 --> 01:00:49.100
she likes animals and nature,
etc.
Etc.

966
01:00:49.310 --> 01:00:52.830
What's the Nashville Guy doing right now?
Yeah,
she likes all that.
But

967
01:00:56.510 --> 01:00:59.570
um,
but she has a fucking kid bill.

968
01:00:59.660 --> 01:01:04.190
I'm fucking 22 years old and can't stop thinking about this girl who has a

969
01:01:04.191 --> 01:01:06.950
fucking kid.
Please give me some advice.

970
01:01:07.160 --> 01:01:09.320
I'm not sure how to proceed.

971
01:01:10.430 --> 01:01:13.730
Well I think you're very concerned with the responsibilities of the fact that

972
01:01:13.731 --> 01:01:18.350
she has a kid and what that's gonna mean and you're only 22 years old and

973
01:01:18.540 --> 01:01:21.470
there's fucking nothing wrong with that.
Okay.

974
01:01:21.471 --> 01:01:25.100
And don't let all these fucking don't don't ask a woman about this cause she's

975
01:01:25.101 --> 01:01:28.820
just going to stick up for the fucking woman because she's kind of insert

976
01:01:28.821 --> 01:01:30.710
herself into that situation would be like,

977
01:01:30.711 --> 01:01:33.620
well I'd still like to be able to find love just cause I have a kid to,

978
01:01:33.860 --> 01:01:37.970
you're 22 years old,
you are a kid.
All right.

979
01:01:38.180 --> 01:01:43.160
Unless you're like really mature or something like that,
that that is a major,

980
01:01:44.630 --> 01:01:49.280
uh,
detail that you should be thinking about.
All right?
So,

981
01:01:50.390 --> 01:01:51.223
uh,

982
01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:55.730
I would respect the fact that there's a voice in your head that's saying,
dude,

983
01:01:55.731 --> 01:02:00.020
she's got a fucking kid.
All right.
Before,

984
01:02:00.950 --> 01:02:03.740
uh,
you know,
because I would tell you right now,
dude,

985
01:02:03.830 --> 01:02:08.480
like what's you're getting involved in there?
You know,
if that goes south,

986
01:02:08.481 --> 01:02:10.520
you're going to break two hearts.
Okay.

987
01:02:10.730 --> 01:02:14.180
Cause there's two people that are going to fall in love with you in that thing.

988
01:02:14.181 --> 01:02:15.070
So make sure you're,

989
01:02:15.071 --> 01:02:20.071
you're prepared and you don't waste her time and that poor kid's time.

990
01:02:21.210 --> 01:02:25.800
All right,
so there you go.
That's my advice to you.

991
01:02:27.420 --> 01:02:30.060
This isn't,
you know,
oh,
look at the titch.
I want to fuck her.

992
01:02:30.061 --> 01:02:33.150
This is not that situation,
you know.
Alright.

993
01:02:33.210 --> 01:02:36.300
Advice Dick,
the douchebag friend.

994
01:02:38.310 --> 01:02:43.220
Dear Billy Angel tits.
Um,
I didn't know what that means,
but I,
oh,

995
01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:47.160
anytime anybody calls me an angel,
I take that as a compliment.
Um,

996
01:02:47.250 --> 01:02:51.420
I guess cause there is white as an angels gown,

997
01:02:53.310 --> 01:02:57.270
maybe it's an insult.
I don't know.
Billy red tits,
Billy devil tits.

998
01:02:58.140 --> 01:03:02.730
It can go either way on that.
Um,
love the podcast.
I thank you.
Uh,

999
01:03:02.731 --> 01:03:06.630
essential.
Always offering great wisdom and words to live by.
I'm really not.

1000
01:03:06.631 --> 01:03:08.940
I'm a fucking moron and you guys listen to me for some reason.

1001
01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:14.060
Maybe you could help me out with this one for the sake of iniquity up.

1002
01:03:14.070 --> 01:03:16.950
I said that right.
Let's call this Douche bag friend of mine.

1003
01:03:16.980 --> 01:03:21.980
Dick Dick is the kind of person that can get annoying and touchy towards women

1004
01:03:22.350 --> 01:03:26.250
when he's drunk,
to the point where it starts to border on harassment.

1005
01:03:26.490 --> 01:03:29.100
It's always weird.
It always weirds me the fuck out.

1006
01:03:29.100 --> 01:03:33.510
And I don't know how to address this behavior.
Simple be like,
hey dick,

1007
01:03:33.630 --> 01:03:37.860
will you fucking knock it off?
What's wrong with you?

1008
01:03:38.610 --> 01:03:41.460
Keep your hands to yourself.
He goes,
a few weeks ago,

1009
01:03:41.461 --> 01:03:46.080
he met this 18 year old girl at a bar.
What the fuck she doing at a bar,

1010
01:03:46.620 --> 01:03:48.180
which we had a great time with.

1011
01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:53.130
We all went to Dick's house afterwards for a couple more dicks drink.
Sorry.

1012
01:03:53.250 --> 01:03:55.980
In Dick tried to make some moves on this girl.

1013
01:03:56.280 --> 01:04:00.570
He couldn't get into her pants that night.
However,
however,
last Friday he did.

1014
01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:02.280
Now this is where it gets crazy.

1015
01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:09.680
The next day he took the girl to a yearly festival to celebrate Liberation Day

1016
01:04:10.350 --> 01:04:13.410
where he and I and a whole bunch of friends at plan to meet up.

1017
01:04:13.411 --> 01:04:15.840
This is obviously from another country,
I don't know,
Liberation Day.

1018
01:04:16.110 --> 01:04:18.600
She basically only knew me and him.

1019
01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:22.320
About 15 minutes into meeting each other there.

1020
01:04:22.321 --> 01:04:24.900
The girl started puking up foam.

1021
01:04:28.530 --> 01:04:32.520
As it turns out,
she hadn't eaten all day and it popped a pill of ecstasy,

1022
01:04:34.470 --> 01:04:37.050
which he had given to her.
Oh my God.

1023
01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:39.870
He didn't seem to care what was happening.

1024
01:04:39.871 --> 01:04:44.871
So I decided to take her to the bathroom area to clean her up and I brought her

1025
01:04:45.271 --> 01:04:48.120
some water and then we went back to look for Dick.
Well,

1026
01:04:48.121 --> 01:04:51.450
why would you take her back to him when we finally found and let me guess,

1027
01:04:51.451 --> 01:04:54.090
he's trying to hook up with somebody else.
I told Dick like to,

1028
01:04:54.091 --> 01:04:55.440
she hasn't eaten all day,
man.

1029
01:04:55.440 --> 01:04:59.460
She was puking back there and you should get her son to eat and what did this

1030
01:04:59.980 --> 01:05:00.570
motherfucking do?

1031
01:05:00.570 --> 01:05:04.530
He quickly walked away and left me to deal with this 18 year old chick for the

1032
01:05:04.531 --> 01:05:05.760
rest of the entire day.

1033
01:05:05.970 --> 01:05:10.080
We didn't see them again for the rest of the day and we made no effort in trying

1034
01:05:10.081 --> 01:05:12.600
to,
he may know effort and trying to find us.

1035
01:05:12.930 --> 01:05:15.660
What a Dick being the gentleman that I am,

1036
01:05:15.661 --> 01:05:20.230
I decided to stay with to guide her through this ecstasy trip.

1037
01:05:21.870 --> 01:05:22.703
Uh,

1038
01:05:23.440 --> 01:05:27.640
I gave her some food and tried to have fun and even though we did have fun,

1039
01:05:27.850 --> 01:05:31.750
it had already ruined that day for me.
He tried to contact me today,

1040
01:05:31.751 --> 01:05:34.810
but I'm really questioning whether he even deserves respond.
What do you think,

1041
01:05:34.811 --> 01:05:35.021
Bill?

1042
01:05:35.021 --> 01:05:38.740
Should I give this tick another chance or is this the kind of person you want to

1043
01:05:38.741 --> 01:05:42.130
cut out of your life?
Complete me.
Thanks.
I'll tell you too.
This is a no brainer.

1044
01:05:43.390 --> 01:05:45.850
I pick up the phone and I would just tell him like,
dude,

1045
01:05:45.851 --> 01:05:50.851
you are a fucking piece of shit and your behavior around women is completely

1046
01:05:53.201 --> 01:05:58.201
unacceptable to the point I would warn other women to stay away from you and I

1047
01:05:59.681 --> 01:06:04.681
don't want to be friends with the person like you have a nice life and God bless

1048
01:06:05.051 --> 01:06:07.690
the United States of America and that's it.
That's an easy one.

1049
01:06:07.750 --> 01:06:10.390
I don't even have to think about that one.
All right.

1050
01:06:10.391 --> 01:06:12.880
Fuck banks bail.

1051
01:06:12.881 --> 01:06:16.120
I'm writing to you because I believe you were the only man crazy and angry

1052
01:06:16.121 --> 01:06:20.380
enough to relate with me on this dude.
Fuck banks.

1053
01:06:20.800 --> 01:06:25.800
Fuck them all this month I just found out I owe my bank $45 apparently fitness

1054
01:06:26.231 --> 01:06:30.790
connection attempted to withdraw $10 from my account these past two months,

1055
01:06:31.180 --> 01:06:35.260
once a month,
and about $5 in my bank two months ago.

1056
01:06:35.620 --> 01:06:40.620
This could not cover the $10 fee a month for my gym membership twice,

1057
01:06:41.411 --> 01:06:46.411
so now I'm being charged a fee of $40 $5 even though one it's debit to fitness,

1058
01:06:47.711 --> 01:06:52.540
didn't actually withdraw the money.
They only attempted to,
nothing went through.

1059
01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:58.200
So not only do I owe my bank $45 by also fitness connection about 50 in late

1060
01:06:58.421 --> 01:07:03.220
fees and the $2 to $10 fees that never got paid.

1061
01:07:03.430 --> 01:07:07.810
Please explain to me why I'm being charged for this transaction that didn't go

1062
01:07:07.811 --> 01:07:08.644
through.

1063
01:07:08.710 --> 01:07:13.710
Is there a guy working in the dark room at the bank pushing buttons who they

1064
01:07:14.171 --> 01:07:16.750
have to pay for the transaction services?
No,

1065
01:07:17.290 --> 01:07:20.170
it's all fucking ones and Zeros.
All computers.

1066
01:07:20.171 --> 01:07:24.820
Yet another fee that we as consumers except for no reason at all,

1067
01:07:25.030 --> 01:07:26.410
even if it makes no sense.

1068
01:07:26.411 --> 01:07:30.160
The idea of letting an entity such as a bank holds your money,

1069
01:07:30.610 --> 01:07:33.700
seems to carry way more cons than it does parks.

1070
01:07:34.690 --> 01:07:39.100
I'm taking your advice and I'm going to call and complain until I get what I

1071
01:07:39.101 --> 01:07:43.120
want.
Fuck banks forever.
Now.
All my money lives in the walls.

1072
01:07:43.870 --> 01:07:45.910
If the house burns down then so be it.

1073
01:07:45.911 --> 01:07:47.800
But at least I didn't get fucked by the man.

1074
01:07:48.040 --> 01:07:50.980
Keep the good work and good luck to your Celtics.

1075
01:07:50.981 --> 01:07:54.340
Jason Tatum is looking like a baller.
All right.

1076
01:07:55.210 --> 01:07:56.830
I agree with a lot of things you're saying there,

1077
01:07:56.831 --> 01:07:59.320
but what you didn't take responsibility for,

1078
01:07:59.321 --> 01:08:03.550
it was your own actions that led to this.
All right?

1079
01:08:04.750 --> 01:08:07.630
If you know that you owe your gym $10 a month,

1080
01:08:08.170 --> 01:08:11.020
you're going to have to fucking have that in your bank account.

1081
01:08:11.021 --> 01:08:14.860
You didn't have that.
So then,
um,
I don't know how it works.

1082
01:08:14.861 --> 01:08:19.340
I know if you write a check and it bounces,
there's a fee.

1083
01:08:19.460 --> 01:08:21.140
So you're saying this is debit,

1084
01:08:21.170 --> 01:08:25.310
but you're using your debit like paying cash and everything.

1085
01:08:25.310 --> 01:08:30.140
So I actually don't think banks are out of line for doing that.

1086
01:08:30.141 --> 01:08:34.220
Why would I think is you need to be more responsible with the money.

1087
01:08:35.030 --> 01:08:38.750
And like I agree with you.
Banks are fucking evil.

1088
01:08:38.751 --> 01:08:43.670
It's a giant Ponzi scheme.
Um,
there's nothing behind the fucking money,

1089
01:08:43.671 --> 01:08:48.050
but everybody believes in it.
So,
hey,
we live another day.
All right.

1090
01:08:49.610 --> 01:08:51.500
Um,
but the thing about it is,

1091
01:08:51.501 --> 01:08:55.100
is you have to learn to make money work for you.

1092
01:08:55.790 --> 01:08:57.170
And if you don't understand money,

1093
01:08:57.200 --> 01:09:02.200
the wonderful thing about the Internet is if you stop reading people screaming

1094
01:09:02.421 --> 01:09:05.780
about politics or watching online porn and all of that Shit,

1095
01:09:06.380 --> 01:09:08.060
which I've been guilty of,
all of that stuff,

1096
01:09:08.210 --> 01:09:11.870
that's actually a lot of things that you can learn.
And,
um,

1097
01:09:12.710 --> 01:09:17.710
what I've learned about money is that money can set you free or it can in

1098
01:09:18.201 --> 01:09:18.860
prison.
You,

1099
01:09:18.860 --> 01:09:22.700
and it all depends on the choices that you're making and the choices that you're

1100
01:09:22.701 --> 01:09:23.510
making.

1101
01:09:23.510 --> 01:09:28.430
Sur are horrific and back in the day would have landed you in all of your family

1102
01:09:28.431 --> 01:09:33.230
into debtors' prisons.
So you got off easy in the modern world.
Um,

1103
01:09:37.190 --> 01:09:39.950
uh,
you know,
I guess taking your money out of the banks,
you know,

1104
01:09:39.980 --> 01:09:42.370
putting you in your walls.
I,
you know,
I,

1105
01:09:42.400 --> 01:09:46.500
I don't disagree with that past a certain amount of fucking money,
but,
uh,

1106
01:09:46.610 --> 01:09:51.410
I like to invest in things that are tangible.
I'm into real estate.

1107
01:09:51.470 --> 01:09:54.200
I'm into buying apartment buildings and shit like that.

1108
01:09:55.550 --> 01:09:59.330
You always have to hedge your bets.
Like I'm buying apartment buildings,

1109
01:10:00.050 --> 01:10:02.960
just starting to do that.
And I was like,
I bought a bunch of looking at one,

1110
01:10:02.990 --> 01:10:03.823
right?

1111
01:10:04.310 --> 01:10:09.310
Because it fascinates me to have income coming into my house every month.

1112
01:10:11.660 --> 01:10:16.100
That's not actually in the business that I'm in and the business that I'm in now

1113
01:10:16.101 --> 01:10:19.730
considering now with social media,
somebody can just say,

1114
01:10:19.731 --> 01:10:23.990
you did something and there's no,
um,

1115
01:10:25.100 --> 01:10:27.380
what do you call it?
There's no due process or anything.

1116
01:10:27.381 --> 01:10:32.150
And that could literally cause everybody in the business you're in to just walk

1117
01:10:32.151 --> 01:10:36.170
away from you and then,
then what do you do?

1118
01:10:36.860 --> 01:10:38.960
You know?
So,
uh,

1119
01:10:41.310 --> 01:10:44.910
and that's just a new pitfall in this fucked up business that I'm in,
which,

1120
01:10:44.911 --> 01:10:49.470
you know,
even before all that,
me too.
Shit.
I mean,
you see these movie stars,

1121
01:10:49.471 --> 01:10:51.030
one hit after another,
one after another,

1122
01:10:51.031 --> 01:10:54.030
and all of a sudden they have a couple of flops in a row and then they just

1123
01:10:54.031 --> 01:10:57.630
disappear.
So this business has always been fickled as hell.

1124
01:10:57.631 --> 01:10:59.730
So I planned on doing this anyways.

1125
01:11:00.330 --> 01:11:02.820
But after all of that stuff came out in like,
you know,

1126
01:11:02.821 --> 01:11:04.590
just recently looking at a Tom Brokaw stuff,

1127
01:11:04.591 --> 01:11:06.060
I don't know if he's guilty or innocent,

1128
01:11:06.960 --> 01:11:09.600
but the fact that two people can just accuse him

1129
01:11:11.160 --> 01:11:14.100
and which is their right.

1130
01:11:14.101 --> 01:11:19.101
But the amount of people that just on the accusations now just look at that guy

1131
01:11:19.171 --> 01:11:23.130
like he's a complete piece of shit is uh,

1132
01:11:24.390 --> 01:11:27.020
isn't right,
isn't,

1133
01:11:27.090 --> 01:11:30.840
isn't any more right than if he actually did what they said they were doing.

1134
01:11:30.841 --> 01:11:34.230
And then he's actually guilty of it.
But to just,
you know,
an accusation,

1135
01:11:34.380 --> 01:11:37.440
it's just an accusation.
But the amount of people that then take that as,

1136
01:11:38.250 --> 01:11:42.120
you know,
game set match is,
um,

1137
01:11:43.470 --> 01:11:48.450
I mean it's just how the world works.
It's just how it works.

1138
01:11:48.451 --> 01:11:52.350
So,
um,
you need to learn about money.

1139
01:11:52.351 --> 01:11:56.370
Can't just say fuck banks and then just be antisocial and have your like money

1140
01:11:56.371 --> 01:12:01.130
in the walls.
I mean,
you,
you,
you can use banks as long as you know what,
what,

1141
01:12:01.131 --> 01:12:04.110
what the game is,
you can use it in your favor.

1142
01:12:05.160 --> 01:12:09.650
And um,
and if you just resist

1143
01:12:11.620 --> 01:12:16.620
the stupidity of consumption and flat screen TVs and all of this shit that these

1144
01:12:17.951 --> 01:12:21.910
stupid fucking celebrities show you when they go into their houses and all,

1145
01:12:21.911 --> 01:12:26.170
I had this stupid,
they all,
what they're showing you is a fucking,

1146
01:12:27.580 --> 01:12:32.120
the only thing that's impressive as the house,
everything else is a,
is a,

1147
01:12:32.270 --> 01:12:36.190
is a liability.
It's all depreciating assets.
They're fucking cars,

1148
01:12:36.191 --> 01:12:39.690
all of that shit.
You know what I mean though,

1149
01:12:39.700 --> 01:12:43.390
those stupid supercars that that's fucking idiots buy that.
You know,

1150
01:12:43.391 --> 01:12:46.670
the only place you really should be taken at as to a track so you can actually

1151
01:12:46.690 --> 01:12:51.640
know,
open the thing up.
And then all of those cards,
like,
you know,

1152
01:12:51.641 --> 01:12:56.641
you look at those Ford gts I saw when the other day for sale and it was like

1153
01:12:57.940 --> 01:13:01.990
fucking 10 15 years old and it was high miles.

1154
01:13:02.080 --> 01:13:07.000
It had 6,000 miles on it.
Now it retained most of its value,

1155
01:13:07.001 --> 01:13:09.910
but it's just,
I dunno,
I guess unless you're going to buy those things,

1156
01:13:09.911 --> 01:13:12.220
but all of those flat screen TVs,

1157
01:13:12.430 --> 01:13:17.400
the monogram fucking stupid shit,
the oil painting yourself,
it's just a bunch.

1158
01:13:17.400 --> 01:13:20.950
It's a bunch of shit.
It's fucking stupid.

1159
01:13:22.810 --> 01:13:22.930
Um,

1160
01:13:22.930 --> 01:13:27.580
the pots and pans that you buy that rather than just buying the ones that target

1161
01:13:27.581 --> 01:13:32.230
you go out and you gotta go to fucking foofy Foose fucking place and getting by

1162
01:13:32.231 --> 01:13:32.441
the,

1163
01:13:32.441 --> 01:13:37.441
these Gore may level fucking pots and pans to heat up your fish sticks because

1164
01:13:38.441 --> 01:13:41.800
at the end of the day is still that blue collared jerk off.

1165
01:13:42.220 --> 01:13:45.940
It's all a fucking waste of money and it's just a bunch of shit.
Now,

1166
01:13:46.060 --> 01:13:50.760
if you actually take your money right,
you know,
and,

1167
01:13:50.810 --> 01:13:53.590
and learn how to invest it,

1168
01:13:55.180 --> 01:13:59.170
and then your money starts making money.
That's when you flip it.

1169
01:13:59.800 --> 01:14:01.870
When your money is earning you fucking money.

1170
01:14:01.871 --> 01:14:06.160
When you're fucking sitting on a couch watching a game and your money is out

1171
01:14:06.161 --> 01:14:10.300
there making you fucking money,
then you understand it.
Um,

1172
01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:13.750
and I mean,
I don't even understand it.
Okay.

1173
01:14:13.751 --> 01:14:18.750
But I'm just starting to learn how to do it.
And the,
the,
I don't know,

1174
01:14:18.760 --> 01:14:21.760
they just,
it's nowhere in the educational system.

1175
01:14:21.761 --> 01:14:23.740
You have to seek out that knowledge itself.

1176
01:14:24.130 --> 01:14:28.580
Like most quality knowledge that's out there,

1177
01:14:28.581 --> 01:14:30.980
you have to seek it out because people aren't going to give it to you.

1178
01:14:31.370 --> 01:14:34.550
So that's what I would say.
So I feel few that you're in that position.

1179
01:14:34.551 --> 01:14:36.710
I've been in that position,
but,
uh,

1180
01:14:36.711 --> 01:14:40.660
I wouldn't say fuck banks use banks rather than have banks use you.
Alright.

1181
01:14:40.790 --> 01:14:44.540
There you go.
Was a long explanation,
but an important subject.
All right.

1182
01:14:44.570 --> 01:14:49.460
My sister's dead beat boyfriend,
Dear Tara.
Billy.

1183
01:14:50.480 --> 01:14:51.530
I mean,
what that means,
I'm a,

1184
01:14:51.800 --> 01:14:54.680
I'm a junior in high school and I live with my mother,

1185
01:14:54.740 --> 01:14:59.250
sister and a dead bee boyfriend.
Wow.
Uh,

1186
01:14:59.540 --> 01:15:03.020
he moved in with intentions to pay rent and help fix up our house.

1187
01:15:03.050 --> 01:15:04.790
That is slowly falling apart.

1188
01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:09.860
Is this Dwight Yoakam from fucking a sling blade.
But for the past year,

1189
01:15:09.861 --> 01:15:13.700
this losers had no job and Pez paid no rent.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1190
01:15:13.701 --> 01:15:15.950
He's a gold digging whores.
Uh,

1191
01:15:15.951 --> 01:15:18.890
all he does is sleep all day and play Xbox.

1192
01:15:19.130 --> 01:15:24.130
He also mentally manipulates my sister by telling her things like her family

1193
01:15:24.261 --> 01:15:28.070
doesn't care enough about her to give her a funeral.

1194
01:15:31.180 --> 01:15:32.020
Oh my God,

1195
01:15:32.200 --> 01:15:35.990
you got to get this guy into the house while he gets high and drunk and touches

1196
01:15:36.120 --> 01:15:40.960
guns around.
My mom has on multiple occasions threatened to kick him out because,

1197
01:15:42.600 --> 01:15:45.600
but she won't in fear that my sister will go with him.

1198
01:15:50.460 --> 01:15:54.540
What in the fuck is
I like,

1199
01:15:54.960 --> 01:15:58.510
I don't even understand how a parent loses his level of control in their own

1200
01:15:58.511 --> 01:16:02.770
house.
So bill,
what do you think I should do about this situation?

1201
01:16:03.580 --> 01:16:05.950
Thank you for being sit down fire.
Thank you.
All right.

1202
01:16:06.430 --> 01:16:11.430
I'm looking forward to that family season three a what do you think I should do?

1203
01:16:12.340 --> 01:16:15.930
Um,
you got to sit down and talk to your mom

1204
01:16:17.520 --> 01:16:20.820
and you just say,
mom,
I know this is a difficult situation,

1205
01:16:20.821 --> 01:16:25.600
but you got to kick this guy out of the house.
Um,
he's drunk and he's,

1206
01:16:25.601 --> 01:16:28.620
he's,
he's walking around with guns.
You got to choose your family first.

1207
01:16:29.280 --> 01:16:33.780
And if our sister chooses him over us,
then so be it.
I mean,
that's it too.

1208
01:16:33.970 --> 01:16:36.900
You've got to get that guy out of the fucking house.
Fuck that loser.
That's it.

1209
01:16:37.620 --> 01:16:39.390
These are all cut and dried this week,

1210
01:16:40.500 --> 01:16:44.520
dumped at fucking Douche than banded that chick after he gave her the ecstasy

1211
01:16:45.360 --> 01:16:46.350
learn,
you know,

1212
01:16:46.380 --> 01:16:49.200
learn how to fucking use money correctly and get this fucking guy out of the

1213
01:16:49.201 --> 01:16:53.210
house.
Jesus Christ.
I feel like I'm cheating on a test here.

1214
01:16:53.211 --> 01:16:56.390
These are easy this week.
Sit Down with your mom and just say,

1215
01:16:56.540 --> 01:16:59.330
we've got to kick this guy out.
Um,

1216
01:17:01.210 --> 01:17:06.160
and this is what I would do.
I would,
um,
if you need to,

1217
01:17:06.161 --> 01:17:09.410
I would call the cops before you kick them out.

1218
01:17:09.411 --> 01:17:10.640
If you think he's going to be a problem.

1219
01:17:10.641 --> 01:17:12.940
I would have the cops come down there and say,
ah,

1220
01:17:12.950 --> 01:17:14.540
I don't want this guy in my house anymore.

1221
01:17:14.750 --> 01:17:18.860
He does have firearms and I want them out of the house.
Um,

1222
01:17:19.250 --> 01:17:22.280
what a fucking loser.
Alright.

1223
01:17:22.310 --> 01:17:25.220
Dumped because of infidelity 20 years ago.

1224
01:17:26.600 --> 01:17:28.370
A big Billy Ball balls,

1225
01:17:29.210 --> 01:17:32.930
massive fan of the podcast and your specials have had me in stitches.

1226
01:17:32.931 --> 01:17:35.180
I thank you.
Um,

1227
01:17:38.050 --> 01:17:39.970
I really need your advice,
opinions,

1228
01:17:40.620 --> 01:17:43.600
opinions slash advice on a situation with recent issues.

1229
01:17:43.960 --> 01:17:46.540
I've just broken up with an amazing lady.

1230
01:17:46.870 --> 01:17:49.090
The woman I was going to propose to this month,

1231
01:17:49.420 --> 01:17:52.930
we had been to get together eight months boat.

1232
01:17:52.960 --> 01:17:54.570
When you get to your late thirties,

1233
01:17:54.590 --> 01:17:58.840
you can cut through the bullshit pretty quickly and get to a meaningful

1234
01:17:58.841 --> 01:17:59.674
relationship.

1235
01:17:59.920 --> 01:18:02.650
I knew she was the one I wanted to spend the rest of my life with our

1236
01:18:02.651 --> 01:18:07.120
relationship add,
Ben,
Greg,
no arguments,
lots of fun,
laughter and love.

1237
01:18:07.360 --> 01:18:12.360
Only one issue existed between us and it seems to have caused the end of the

1238
01:18:13.031 --> 01:18:17.200
relationship.
I'm not long after we started dating,

1239
01:18:17.201 --> 01:18:21.520
we were out having drinks and we were talking lately about past relationship and

1240
01:18:21.521 --> 01:18:25.600
she asked if I'd ever been unfaithful.
I want it to be honest and said yes.

1241
01:18:25.810 --> 01:18:30.250
She asked to know more and I just described a time when I was 20 and I had been

1242
01:18:30.251 --> 01:18:32.350
an idiot and cheated on my girlfriend at the time.

1243
01:18:32.350 --> 01:18:36.580
I stressed that I regretted it and I've never entertained the thought of doing

1244
01:18:36.581 --> 01:18:38.620
that again.
I am simply not the same guy.

1245
01:18:38.920 --> 01:18:43.480
She reacted fairly badly leaving the pub crying outside before coming back in

1246
01:18:44.020 --> 01:18:48.430
and telling me she wished I'd lied.
We managed to get past it though.

1247
01:18:48.431 --> 01:18:53.380
That night,
Dude,
you went 20 relationship one on his normal.

1248
01:18:53.381 --> 01:18:57.820
We shared many weekends and holidays,
Fun Nights out,
cozy nights in,

1249
01:18:58.060 --> 01:19:01.870
talked about a future together and I was invited to share Christmas and New

1250
01:19:01.870 --> 01:19:05.380
Year's with your entire family was great.
Even as recently as last week,

1251
01:19:05.381 --> 01:19:09.430
she was redesigning my garden for use in the summer.

1252
01:19:10.960 --> 01:19:13.660
It is rare.
It's had two more times since then.

1253
01:19:13.990 --> 01:19:18.370
Once on my birthday in January when we nearly broke up over it and she was

1254
01:19:18.371 --> 01:19:21.520
struggling with it again.
She was so upset,
kept saying,

1255
01:19:21.521 --> 01:19:23.260
why couldn't you have just lied?

1256
01:19:23.710 --> 01:19:28.710
But we talked through and moved on again or so I thought and then of course

1257
01:19:29.831 --> 01:19:33.460
recently when it all ended,
every time it is coming up.

1258
01:19:33.700 --> 01:19:36.670
I've been honest and shown true remorse and been very supportive.

1259
01:19:37.180 --> 01:19:42.180
Very recently we broke up because she just can't get past my past and said it's

1260
01:19:42.401 --> 01:19:45.550
the only thing stopping her from committing to me fully.
She loves me.

1261
01:19:45.850 --> 01:19:50.380
Wanted to be talking about having shoulder with me,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,

1262
01:19:50.381 --> 01:19:55.150
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
I don't need to be re this.
Everywhere you look,

1263
01:19:55.151 --> 01:19:58.840
all you hear is the once a cheater,
always a cheater lines,

1264
01:19:58.841 --> 01:20:01.960
which in my case simply is not true.
I know

1265
01:20:03.930 --> 01:20:06.710
that's some of this stems from one of her past relationship,

1266
01:20:06.711 --> 01:20:10.920
which in 2016 when she was engaged and the guy broke it off and ran off in front

1267
01:20:10.921 --> 01:20:13.080
of her friends.
I don't want to lose this lady.

1268
01:20:13.081 --> 01:20:16.020
Only back on Valentine's Day,

1269
01:20:16.021 --> 01:20:18.210
she made me present

1270
01:20:21.330 --> 01:20:22.310
only back on Valentine's Day.

1271
01:20:22.311 --> 01:20:25.130
She made me a president of a hundred reasons why she loves me.

1272
01:20:25.460 --> 01:20:28.100
One of them was that she thinks about the future.

1273
01:20:28.101 --> 01:20:32.930
She only saw it with me and then I made her feel like no one else has.

1274
01:20:33.770 --> 01:20:38.390
This can surely be saved,
but I don't understand it and I don't know what to do.

1275
01:20:38.420 --> 01:20:41.810
Thanks bill and go fuck yourself.
Well,
I mean,
what the fuck can you do?

1276
01:20:43.610 --> 01:20:46.730
I mean,
if she's going to judge you by what you did when you were 20 years old,

1277
01:20:47.450 --> 01:20:50.240
I just laid on tables that,
listen,
I want to marry you.
All right,

1278
01:20:51.040 --> 01:20:53.450
well there's nothing I could do to make,
you know,

1279
01:20:53.451 --> 01:20:55.490
I'm paying for the sins of that last guy.

1280
01:20:56.240 --> 01:20:58.620
And if you want to throw this relationship because of that away,

1281
01:20:58.700 --> 01:21:03.110
because of that last guy that's on you,
dude,
you've done all you can do here,

1282
01:21:04.770 --> 01:21:05.980
the tunnel,
all you can do here.

1283
01:21:06.070 --> 01:21:11.050
So she's obviously not over that other guy or the pain of that other guy and now

1284
01:21:11.051 --> 01:21:13.780
you're paying for it.
Um,

1285
01:21:16.800 --> 01:21:18.810
I dunno.
So I mean,
what the fuck can you do?

1286
01:21:18.930 --> 01:21:21.300
I would just tell her how I feel about her and just say,
listen,

1287
01:21:21.301 --> 01:21:25.380
I'm ready to get married anytime you want to.
But um,

1288
01:21:26.700 --> 01:21:30.210
if you don't,
then you got to let me go and I gotta move on.
I got to get,

1289
01:21:30.270 --> 01:21:30.660
you know,

1290
01:21:30.660 --> 01:21:34.410
cause I'm in my late thirties and if you don't trust me enough that I'm not

1291
01:21:34.520 --> 01:21:38.790
going to fuck around on you,
then I,
you know,
I don't want to tell you
that.

1292
01:21:38.880 --> 01:21:42.080
I guess it is over,
but it's going to be your call.
It's not my call.

1293
01:21:43.410 --> 01:21:46.440
Something like that.
I Dunno.
That's a tough one,
buddy.
All right,
the last one.

1294
01:21:46.441 --> 01:21:48.040
Last one here.
Jesus is alone pocket.

1295
01:21:48.150 --> 01:21:52.050
It's did I blow my chances with this girl from work?
Hello,

1296
01:21:52.051 --> 01:21:56.520
Bill Nye the angry guy.
I'll keep this as short as I can.

1297
01:21:58.320 --> 01:22:03.030
Who just opened that door?
Hey Buddy.
Hey,

1298
01:22:04.110 --> 01:22:08.010
what's up cutie pie?
Um,

1299
01:22:08.430 --> 01:22:12.200
I guess I'm watching you right now.
Hi.
Huh?

1300
01:22:15.090 --> 01:22:20.010
What's going on?
Don't pull the cord.
Okay.
Don't pull the cord.

1301
01:22:20.660 --> 01:22:23.830
All right.
Yeah,
it helped me out with this one.
Oh,

1302
01:22:24.470 --> 01:22:27.600
this guy's acids that I blow my chances with this girl from work.
Hello,

1303
01:22:27.601 --> 01:22:30.720
Bill Nye the angry guy.
I'll keep this short as I can.

1304
01:22:30.960 --> 01:22:33.000
I work with this girl that is a solid 10.

1305
01:22:33.001 --> 01:22:36.780
She's absolutely gorgeous and a personality matches mine in 100 different ways

1306
01:22:37.140 --> 01:22:41.610
and she's a nerdy chick,
which is a massive plus.
If you saw her,
you'd say,

1307
01:22:42.180 --> 01:22:44.760
holy s,
why does she work in a place like this?

1308
01:22:45.020 --> 01:22:48.960
Can't curse my kids here a quick and simple.
I got to know her.

1309
01:22:48.961 --> 01:22:53.490
We constantly flirted back,
back and forward,
not back and forth near.

1310
01:22:53.790 --> 01:22:57.690
They flirted back and forward.
Uh,
she put a lot of attention on me.

1311
01:22:57.720 --> 01:23:00.180
Not to sound egotistical,
but I'm a good looking.

1312
01:23:00.720 --> 01:23:04.500
I thought he said 62 year old guy's six foot two guy.

1313
01:23:05.290 --> 01:23:09.490
My issue is that when I get too comfortable,

1314
01:23:09.491 --> 01:23:14.491
I began to spill my red flags and I start to describe my self confidence issues.

1315
01:23:15.250 --> 01:23:20.110
I guess I do this to see if she's okay with them.
Bad move.
Yes it is.

1316
01:23:20.440 --> 01:23:24.370
After working with her for nearly a year and a half now she seems distant.
Yeah.

1317
01:23:24.371 --> 01:23:28.000
You probably waited two.
One.
We used to watch the same shows,

1318
01:23:28.001 --> 01:23:29.110
not physically together,

1319
01:23:29.111 --> 01:23:32.760
but then come to work the next day and have long conversations about how Austin

1320
01:23:32.990 --> 01:23:36.130
though they were.
She used to make efforts to initiate conversation.

1321
01:23:36.131 --> 01:23:39.710
Now she barely acknowledges me anymore.
It was really sudden.
Well,

1322
01:23:39.711 --> 01:23:44.710
she probably met someone.
I'm not trying to be a dick here.
I've tried,
uh,

1323
01:23:44.760 --> 01:23:48.090
a lot to strike up conversation,
but she acts disinterested.

1324
01:23:48.360 --> 01:23:52.740
I started trying to make her jealous,
but she doesn't seem to give a f.
Uh,

1325
01:23:52.741 --> 01:23:55.980
we work in an almost exclusive male workplace,

1326
01:23:55.981 --> 01:24:00.210
so of course everyone is trying to get with her.
It burns my blood to watch it,

1327
01:24:00.211 --> 01:24:02.590
but it's my fault.
Is there anything I can do to reserve,

1328
01:24:02.670 --> 01:24:07.290
reverse my situation or vice sealed this case shut.
Thanks for reading.

1329
01:24:07.291 --> 01:24:11.540
Please come to,
I'm not going to say the city in case she's listening.
Um,

1330
01:24:12.110 --> 01:24:16.680
yeah,
I think he blew it with her.
The only girlfriend broke up with you.
Huh?

1331
01:24:17.090 --> 01:24:19.220
Your work girlfriend broke up with yeah.
Yeah.

1332
01:24:19.221 --> 01:24:22.370
I think what you need to do is move on and,
uh,

1333
01:24:22.570 --> 01:24:26.270
stop talking about your confidence issues.
You need to get some confidence in.

1334
01:24:26.271 --> 01:24:29.810
You need to get outside the workplace and,
uh,

1335
01:24:29.840 --> 01:24:33.320
you need to start hitting on some women and you need to go on dates and then

1336
01:24:33.321 --> 01:24:36.500
you're going to feel more confident about yourself and that should the best way

1337
01:24:36.501 --> 01:24:39.400
to try and make this woman more interested in you.
All right.

1338
01:24:39.660 --> 01:24:44.120
Don't s where you eat anyway,
right.
Don't s where you eat.
Yeah.

1339
01:24:45.550 --> 01:24:49.760
Yeah.
Because,
yeah,
exactly.
Exactly.
Well,
this guy doesn't have confidence,

1340
01:24:49.761 --> 01:24:51.680
so he's not going to walk up to a woman that he doesn't really know.

1341
01:24:51.681 --> 01:24:55.110
He needs to get over that Hump Hump,
which is why it worked.

1342
01:24:55.130 --> 01:24:56.870
Because there's a reason it's supposed to be there.

1343
01:24:56.871 --> 01:24:59.360
He feels more comfortable and he,
you know,

1344
01:24:59.390 --> 01:25:02.060
she was probably waiting for him to ask around and then he didn't.

1345
01:25:02.061 --> 01:25:05.240
And then now it sounds like she's with somebody else.
Yeah.

1346
01:25:05.241 --> 01:25:08.990
Or She's just over his,
just over it,
you know,

1347
01:25:09.410 --> 01:25:13.460
that'll fun.
Like I said,
work,
boyfriend,
girlfriend relationship,

1348
01:25:13.461 --> 01:25:17.440
and now she's moved on.
Yeah,
there you go.
Yeah.
So,
uh,
yeah.

1349
01:25:17.450 --> 01:25:20.330
Do plenty of fish in the sea,
you know,

1350
01:25:20.360 --> 01:25:23.390
and don't waste your time getting jealous with this person.

1351
01:25:23.391 --> 01:25:27.350
Just like you go in there,
you know you don't care.
[inaudible] hi.

1352
01:25:28.370 --> 01:25:29.203
Hi.

1353
01:25:30.160 --> 01:25:30.730
<v 0>Oh</v>

1354
01:25:30.730 --> 01:25:32.410
<v 1>yeah.
What's up?
Smiley.</v>

1355
01:25:33.500 --> 01:25:37.130
<v 0>Huh?
Please say hi.</v>

1356
01:25:38.440 --> 01:25:39.273
<v 1>Um,
it was funny now,</v>

1357
01:25:39.320 --> 01:25:42.090
and she speaks jibberish but she knows exactly what she's saying and then she'll

1358
01:25:42.091 --> 01:25:44.550
just throw in a random real world.
She'd be,
like I said,

1359
01:25:45.090 --> 01:25:46.860
Jack Chick kept Gigi Turkey.
Kai.

1360
01:25:48.200 --> 01:25:48.620
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1361
01:25:48.620 --> 01:25:51.880
<v 1>Huh.
Yeah.
You want to tell some stories?
All right.</v>

1362
01:25:51.881 --> 01:25:55.090
That's the podcast for this week a go.

1363
01:25:55.091 --> 01:25:58.690
You know what yourselves and I'll check in on you on Thursday.

1364
01:26:00.330 --> 01:26:03.170
Bye.
Yeah.
Congratulations to the Tampa Bay lightning.

1365
01:26:03.380 --> 01:26:07.520
Give you a bunch of bs.
All right,
I'll talk to you later.
