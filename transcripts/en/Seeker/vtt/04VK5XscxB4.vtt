00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:04.930
GPS satellites are constantly bathing the
world in their electromagnetic signally glow,

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:16.000
but how EXACTLY do these satellites find you?

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.810
Saying a satellite finds YOU is very Enemy
of the State, very NBC TV government drama;

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:25.340
but GPS satellites don't actually track you,
they're simply broadcasting a signal that

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.849
you pick up. What would be a more accurate
way to look at it is, GPS doesn't find you,

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.039
but you find it.

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:35.710
The Global Positioning System is network of
around 30 satellites, a receiver, and a SUPER

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.530
accurate clock; all pulled together with math.
The system was created in the 1980s for the

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.190
military, but they opened it up for civilian
use, and it has since changed how we find

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.399
directions, look for pizza, and connect with
each other. But how it works, requires a TON

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:50.579
of incredible science.

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.739
Firstly, we have to know what time it is.
I know that seems strange, but if you don't

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:58.210
have a SUPER ACCURATE measure of time, you
can't do GPS!

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.719
The most accurate measure of time humans have,
is the constant, predictable vibration of

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:07.320
an atom. The U.S. Naval Observatory in Washington,
D.C., is the official United States time.

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:14.810
They mark time, by measuring billionths of
a second using 9,192,631,770 electron vibrations

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:21.360
of a Cesium-133 atom. This atomic clock is
accurate to nanoseconds… which is super

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.360
important.

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.439
Secondly we have to have a satellite network
which ALSO know the time. As of October 19,

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:33.939
2015, there were GPS 31 satellites with three
atomic clocks on board, as well as transmitters

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:39.100
to send microwave signals out at the planet
below. The system is flying at 11,000 kilometers

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.610
per hour, about 20000 kilometers above our
heads (7000mph/12500mi) and is maintained

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.220
by the U.S. Air Force. Those signals?

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.630
Those are what are telling you where you are
on the planet!

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.259
Okay, so. GPS signals are sent at exact intervals.
Say…

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:57.210
every few seconds. Embedded in microwave signal
is the ID of the satellite, the health of

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.100
the satellite, the location of all the satellites
in the system, and the precise date and time.

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.340
VERY precise. Because Tens of thousands of
kilometers away on the ground, the signals

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:12.280
will be picked up by your smartphone once
you click, let the pizza app know your location.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.090
Smartphones and GPS units have to have very
precise time, because microwave signals travel

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.849
at the speed of light, roughly 300,000 kilometers
per second, so in a fraction of a second,

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:24.330
the signal travels from each satellite to
you!

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.340
This is why we need atomic clocks, because
20-30 nanoseconds matter!

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.319
But we'll come back to this in a sec. The
receiver can tell where each satellite is,

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:39.349
by the difference in time lag. Using a mathematical
process called trilateration the GPS unit

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:44.870
can determine your exact location. Basically,
a sphere is drawn indicating the time lag

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.030
from each satellite and the overlapping point
is your current location!

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.260
After ALL THAT, the pizza app knows exactly
where you are.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.379
Before you get confused, there's NOT an atomic
clock in your smartphone, but as long as the

00:02:56.379 --> 00:03:02.150
smartphone clock is pretty good, it can will
regular updates from the Observatory clock

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:03.150
and stay on track!

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.200
The more satellites it can "see" the more
accurate the location. If you pick up three

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.970
satellites, your GPS can determine your 2D
location (latitude and longitude), but with

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.010
four it can tell your altitude too!

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.050
As you move, the time lag from the satellite
to the antenna of each signal will change,

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:22.569
and by constantly updating the trilateration
math, the location dot on your map moves.

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:27.299
Even after all this work just to get a pizza
delivered, there's a ton more complications.

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:32.010
Satellites need replacement, and only have
an operational life of 7-15 years. So they

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.370
have to keep launching new ones. We're on
our fifth generation now, and they're getting

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.819
a lot better, but they're not perfect. The
satellite signals can bounce off an ionized

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:44.120
layer of the atmosphere called ionosphere
-- AM radio bounces off it from the ground

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.700
too. It's not friendly to signals going through
it. But on top of THAT GPS satellites are

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:55.989
traveling FAST and far away, meaning Einstein's
General &amp; Special Relativity comes into play.

00:03:55.989 --> 00:04:03.189
Even if the atomic clocks are super accurate,
the ones on the satellites are ticking faster

00:04:03.189 --> 00:04:06.269
than the Naval Observatory clock, because
gravity is stronger on Earth and they're moving

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:07.269
so fast!

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:08.269
SO!

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:12.220
The GPS has to mathematically calculate and
adjust for the roughly 45,000 nanoseconds

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:19.579
per day of difference in time; since being
off by 20-30 nanoseconds can make the system

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:22.570
pretty much worthless. This a big deal. It's
frickin' crazy.

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:27.190
Thanks to the space program, Einstein's relativistic
physics, atomic clocks, and smart phones,

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:32.320
you my friend, can get a pizza delivered to
your exact location -- give or take a few

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:33.770
feet. What do you want?

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.979
We're not perfect. Yet. The next generation
should get us within inches.

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:42.070
And thank you also to the US Air Force for
sponsoring this message, and making sure the

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:46.729
pizza guy knows where to come. Every day American
Airmen go above and beyond to break barriers

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:51.370
both professionally and personally. The United
States Air Force is powered by Airmen, fueled

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:56.520
by innovation.
Crazily enough, your BRAIN has GPS too, after

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.120
a fashion. A set of cells creates a map of
the stuff around you…

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.490
No, no, I'll let this super handsome guy with
a great t-shirt collection explain it.
