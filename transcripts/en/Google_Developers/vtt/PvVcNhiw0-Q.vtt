[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:10.227 --> 00:00:12.160
SARAH MCCRARY: I
am so happy to be

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.750
here with this
audience this morning

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:17.470
and sharing this message--
claiming your value

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:19.080
as a technical leader.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.370
This presentation is built out
mostly on my experiences, both

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:27.330
what I have done that's worked
and what has not worked,

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.320
and also observing others that
I interact with and collaborate

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.830
with and find out
what makes them

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:36.900
effective as technical leaders,
and just as importantly,

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.730
what makes them ineffective.

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.220
Sometimes you learn a lot more
from the "what didn't work"

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.490
and "that is not gonna
help us" side of the coin.

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:48.610
So my mission here today is to
share these learnings with you.

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.830
And I would just love to, during
lunch or during the other parts

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:53.975
of this, get
together, to meet you,

00:00:53.975 --> 00:00:56.350
and hear about your experiences
and answer your questions

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:56.850
to you.

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.510
Because I learn so much just
meeting people and hearing

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.900
how you're doing and
what challenges you have.

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.250
So just a quick thing-- if
this helps you strike up

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.100
a conversation with
me, I care a lot

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.260
about growing leadership
opportunities for women

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.200
in technical product careers.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.170
It's something that I try to do
within my organization as well.

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.640
And it'll be a common theme
through our notes here today.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.130
Claiming your value starts
with understanding your power.

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:34.500
I find that a lot of women just
don't like talking about power.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.550
It seems aggressive and
unattractive to think

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:38.820
about power.

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.850
OK, don't think
about it that way.

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:42.860
But if that's what
it does, it kind

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.710
of strikes that note with
you, think about it this way.

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:46.610
What is power?

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.600
It's your ability to influence.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.810
And I think that everybody
here has some ability

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.580
to influence in some way.

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.410
So what we need to
figure out is how

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:58.960
we're going to take that ability
to influence, capture it, grow

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.160
it, hold it, and then
help spread it, right?

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.020
So when you're thinking
about claiming your value

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.490
as a technical leader,
you've got to think about,

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.449
where does my
influence come from?

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:11.230
Where does my power come from?

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.160
And there's actually some
organizational behavior

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.420
research that goes back about
40 years on this very topic.

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.130
I gave a similar discussion
with a group of women

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:23.200
in Boston Product.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.070
Was anybody there?

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.776
Anybody here at the Boston
Women Product event?

00:02:26.776 --> 00:02:28.400
OK, so this is all
fresh to all of you.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.190
Great.

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.460
And what I said is, when
I conceived of this topic,

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:37.170
I was going back to
when I was in school.

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.350
There were five sources
of organizational power.

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.410
And doing the research
to update my notes,

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.010
it turns out there
are seven now.

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.764
So this is an active body
of academic research.

00:02:48.764 --> 00:02:49.430
There are seven.

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.430
We're going to go through
those seven right now.

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.310
The first and probably the most
obvious source of your power

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.540
is called legitimate power.

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.170
It's your position.

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.490
Any position you take
in an organization,

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:05.120
whether that's in
industry, in government,

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.562
whether that's social
networks, and by that

00:03:08.562 --> 00:03:10.270
I mean like where
you're getting together

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:13.940
with people to do things
as an organization,

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.600
you have a position.

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.730
You have a job title,
a job description.

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:19.960
This is what you're doing.

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:21.440
And there are
certain decisions you

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.300
get to make because you're
occupying that position.

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.670
That's what this source
of power is all about.

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.580
If you are the CEO or
president of a company,

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.700
you have a very different
sort of positional power.

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.200
But you just as much do if
you are the QA analyst joining

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.840
a new team have a
position of power

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.810
that you get to make
decisions from-- really pretty

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.330
clear and obvious.

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:47.890
It's also probably the one
that people overestimate.

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:50.310
They think, ah,
I've got this role.

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.080
Therefore, I get to
make these decisions.

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.830
I'm in control.

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:54.100
And it turns out you're not.

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.670
So we'll move on
to the next one.

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.790
Charisma-- so if positional
power is all about what you've

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.710
been vested with by a
job title, then charisma

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:08.770
is also called referent power,
is really what comes from you.

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:12.510
This is the expression of who
you are, what you believe,

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.750
and how what you believe
and how you communicate

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:16.589
it can influence others.

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:19.510
You probably all know someone
that has a lot of charisma.

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:22.890
Like, it's the person that
you go into a group of people,

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:24.680
and they just kind
of get others kind

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.210
of thinking the way they think.

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.490
They engage people.

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:32.000
That's kind of an
extroverted type of charisma.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
But there's also
introverted charisma, too.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.300
So if you're like me and
you are an introvert,

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.760
you can also have that kind
of charisma or referent power.

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.200
And you can grow it.

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:45.520
The third source is reward.

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.660
So this is you're
in a place where

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:50.240
you can deliver incentives.

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.360
On the flip side of
this, is coercive power,

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.300
meaning you can
deliver sanctions.

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.300
So I think in most
organizations you can probably

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.410
think of somebody
who, they really

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:01.790
derive what power
and influence they

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:07.030
have based on what they can give
out or what they can take away.

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:09.570
Sometimes I think about
in my organization

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:13.890
we have a sales organization
that they run very

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:17.210
much by production targets.

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:19.070
And if you hit those
production targets,

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:21.620
certain managers have the
ability to reward you for that.

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:22.870
Those are the kind incentives.

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:25.690
So those sales leaders
have a lot of power

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:28.870
that just comes from being
able to deliver incentives.

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:30.830
On the flip side,
we have some people

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:33.060
that derive power in
kind of a perverse way,

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:35.450
from being able to
deliver sanctions.

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:38.250
And I would tell you
that these are also not

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:41.260
great sources of power
because they're just

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.150
tied to your ability
to give or take.

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:44.870
And they're not really lasting.

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:46.980
They're not enduring.

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:49.656
So the next is expertise.

00:05:49.656 --> 00:05:52.540
Expertise is actually
a source of power

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:54.800
you can influence for yourself.

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.210
You can grow your expertise
in a subject, right?

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:01.860
So expertise is when
you collect knowledge

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:04.027
and you collect experience,
applying that knowledge.

00:06:04.027 --> 00:06:05.109
This is about your skills.

00:06:05.109 --> 00:06:06.880
This is about how you
take that knowledge

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.280
and you apply it in the world,
and people recognize you

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:13.650
for having that special
junction of knowledge and skills

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:15.670
to apply it, right?

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:18.850
Similar, but distinct,
is informational power.

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:21.370
A lot of times
informational power,

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:24.670
I think, gets abused because
we've all worked with

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:28.040
or had some dealing with
the person who was like,

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:30.090
I get all my power from
having this information,

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:32.150
and I'm not going to
share it with you.

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:33.580
I'm going to keep it.

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:36.810
And that's how
informational power is

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:38.292
distinct from experience, right?

00:06:38.292 --> 00:06:40.500
Experience, you're out there,
and you're applying it.

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:42.990
Information means,
really, it's just

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:46.590
about having access
to certain information

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:52.110
that maybe is not widely
dispersed or knowing it so.

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:55.380
I would say focus on
expertise and recognize

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:59.170
that informational power,
again, is very fragile.

00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:01.540
So the seventh and
the newest-- and I

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:03.720
put the resources here
from some of the studies.

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:05.261
You can find there's
a lot of studies

00:07:05.261 --> 00:07:07.160
online by these authors.

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:08.500
But the newest is connections.

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:10.375
I think this makes so
much sense in our world

00:07:10.375 --> 00:07:14.740
today because we are getting
more and more connected.

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:16.351
And this is a great example.

00:07:16.351 --> 00:07:17.725
This event and
the people sitting

00:07:17.725 --> 00:07:18.880
at your table and the
people that you're

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:20.505
going to meet around
you, get connected

00:07:20.505 --> 00:07:24.580
with them because having access
to others is a source of power.

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:27.160
It's a source of influence.

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:30.530
I have really come to
respect this much more

00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:32.030
in the last few years.

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:34.046
And it's made a difference
in my life in a way

00:07:34.046 --> 00:07:35.420
that I didn't
anticipate it would

00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:37.230
maybe four or five years ago.

00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:39.730
So think about how you
can grow and nurture

00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:42.740
and hold on to your connections
and make some new ones here.

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:44.490
This is part about
building out your power

00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:46.910
base and your influence.

00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:51.080
So now that we understand
how to grow our influence,

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:54.860
there are these seven kind of
distinct ways and power bases,

00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:57.370
and we can actually think
about them methodically.

00:07:57.370 --> 00:07:58.630
We have a challenge.

00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:01.610
And that challenge
is, how do I claim

00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:04.930
that value as a technical
leader by asserting

00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:09.660
expert power, referent
power, and connection power.

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:14.719
So this is really where
the how to do something,

00:08:14.719 --> 00:08:17.260
the techniques, I would call
it, are going to come into play.

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.610
And I want to spend the balance
of our time here talking

00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:20.930
about this.

00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:26.150
So I've broken this down
into four challenges.

00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:29.270
So here's challenge number one.

00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:32.520
If you really, really
want to assert your value,

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:35.010
claim your value as
a technical leader,

00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:38.419
take the risk of being wrong.

00:08:38.419 --> 00:08:40.850
And this may sound
counterintuitive.

00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:43.980
So let's look at effective and
ineffective ways to do this.

00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:46.010
Effective-- pretty obvious.

00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:48.400
Do your research and
defend your position,

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:50.420
have confidence in
what you're doing.

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:52.440
Now, the mistake I see
a lot of people make

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:55.300
is they do their
research, and they

00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:57.510
wait to defend their
position until they

00:08:57.510 --> 00:09:01.560
have 100% certainty about
what they're going to say.

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:04.670
You've missed the boat because
effective decision making

00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:07.550
isn't about being
absolutely 100% right

00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:08.850
with great certainty.

00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:11.580
It's about reducing uncertainty.

00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:14.990
Don't expect perfect
knowledge, right?

00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:18.020
Your mission should be to work
to reduce uncertainty, not

00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:18.990
eliminate it.

00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:23.680
If you wait too long, then you
are missing the opportunity

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:27.495
to expand and assert your
expert power on something

00:09:27.495 --> 00:09:29.410
that you've worked hard for.

00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:32.280
So the ineffective side
of this is doing things

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:35.550
like apologizing for having
a difference of opinion.

00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:37.119
That is a very ineffective way.

00:09:37.119 --> 00:09:39.660
If you're going to take the risk
of being wrong, and then go,

00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:42.520
I'm very sorry about
it, that's going to ruin

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:43.816
your referent power base.

00:09:43.816 --> 00:09:45.690
People are going to say,
well, wait a minute.

00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:47.800
Are you standing up for
that, or are you not?

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:51.400
And it will also diminish
your expert power.

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:54.510
Giving up on your
position too early

00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:57.700
and then staying quiet
until you feel 100% certain,

00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:01.080
these are very ineffective
ways to grow your power.

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:04.150
So get out there, take
the risk of being wrong.

00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:07.750
Put yourself in the position
of having expertise and then

00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:08.850
flexing it.

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:11.820
And I think this has
been the lesson that most

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:13.760
impacted my career growth.

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:16.410
When I stopped
sitting, saying I'm

00:10:16.410 --> 00:10:18.880
listening to all of the
people around the table,

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:21.670
and I'm afraid to speak up
because what if I'm wrong?

00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:24.940
When I started speaking
up, sometimes I was wrong.

00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:26.460
But people didn't remember that.

00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:29.270
People remembered that I could
stand up, make an argument,

00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:30.414
defend my position.

00:10:30.414 --> 00:10:31.580
That's what they remembered.

00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:35.800
And that starts to grow
that power base for you.

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:40.260
Here's the next one, get
comfortable with conflict.

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:43.960
And I don't mean
physical altercations.

00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:47.200
Else we may end up trending
on one of the boards

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:49.840
that Fernanda showed us.

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:51.370
But get comfortable
with conflict

00:10:51.370 --> 00:10:58.450
is really about being able
to articulate and defend

00:10:58.450 --> 00:11:01.560
your position in a
place that's comfortable

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:06.970
and also to call out to others
when you don't agree with them

00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:09.310
and to do it in a respectful
and constructive way.

00:11:09.310 --> 00:11:13.580
So effective techniques
for this-- many of you

00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:16.260
probably read Stephen
Covey's "7 Habits."

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.590
It's a, like, old standby.

00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:21.476
I read it every other year
or so just to remind myself.

00:11:21.476 --> 00:11:23.350
And there's a habit
there called, "seek first

00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:24.560
to understand."

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:28.790
So before you set out to
have conflict with someone,

00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:31.600
understand what is it
that you're actually

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:32.530
conflicting over.

00:11:32.530 --> 00:11:35.150
Understand the basis of that--
what are the facts, what

00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:35.900
are the arguments.

00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:38.600
And it should never
be about the person.

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:41.190
It should always be
about the facts, right?

00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:44.220
I learned this
tip from a manager

00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:48.140
in one of my very early jobs.

00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:51.970
She always started off,
can you help me understand?

00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:56.710
And it is such a comfortable
way to demonstrate

00:11:56.710 --> 00:11:59.300
to the other party that
you're interested in where

00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:01.002
they're coming from.

00:12:01.002 --> 00:12:02.460
I don't agree with
you, but can you

00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:06.540
help me understand why you keep
portraying the requirements

00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:07.910
of this product in this way?

00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:09.910
And can you help
me understand that?

00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:12.210
And then that really
gets to the bottom

00:12:12.210 --> 00:12:14.750
of how you can talk
about facts and you

00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:19.310
can talk about what you're
actually conflicting over.

00:12:19.310 --> 00:12:21.640
The flip side of
that also is practice

00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:25.540
being direct and saying,
I don't agree with you.

00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:27.590
Here's why.

00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:31.760
Now, it's not appropriate to
say, I don't agree with you.

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:32.900
Here is why.

00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:36.680
I don't trust your
taste in shoes.

00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:38.870
It's really this is about
I don't agree with you.

00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:41.320
Here's why-- my facts, my data.

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:42.730
Here's where I'm coming from.

00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:44.900
Let's talk about it
in a constructive way.

00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:47.200
And then just learn to
recognize and nurture

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:49.040
constructive conflict.

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:52.290
We probably have all been
around people who actually don't

00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:54.880
practice constructive conflict.

00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:57.130
They practice some
type of bullying.

00:12:57.130 --> 00:12:59.320
And that's the
ineffective behavior here.

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:02.647
When you're diminishing
someone else's position

00:13:02.647 --> 00:13:04.980
based on something other than
the merits of their claim,

00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:06.550
you're being a bully.

00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:10.380
If you're drawing on a
positional or referent power

00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:14.170
of someone else-- well, I'm
telling you to do it this way

00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:16.500
because I'm the-- fill it in.

00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:17.770
And it's my position.

00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:20.770
That's a terrible reason,
and it's a terrible practice

00:13:20.770 --> 00:13:23.330
to try and influence others.

00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:25.200
And then if you're
saying, well, you

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:28.295
know, the CEO said that
you need to do this,

00:13:28.295 --> 00:13:29.170
that's name dropping.

00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:31.890
You need to build that influence
from your own arguments,

00:13:31.890 --> 00:13:35.500
not from referring to someone
else's referent power, right?

00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:37.100
So get comfortable
with conflict.

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:42.080
Find effective ways to have
that constructive conflict.

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:45.600
And it is a way to move
forward and to move

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:49.820
your mission forward,
your goals forward.

00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:53.950
This is be decisive
under pressure.

00:13:53.950 --> 00:13:56.650
This is an area that I
get a lot of questions

00:13:56.650 --> 00:14:00.410
about because I said that
the effective way to be

00:14:00.410 --> 00:14:02.410
decisive under pressure--
there's actually

00:14:02.410 --> 00:14:06.510
a way you can grow
that as a skill

00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:08.870
and as a part of who you are.

00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:10.580
And it's having a
decision-making system

00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:12.060
to fall back on.

00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:13.990
One of the things about
being under pressure

00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:16.060
is you've got time urgency.

00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:17.171
You've got stakes.

00:14:17.171 --> 00:14:17.920
What are we doing?

00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:19.295
We've got to make
a decision now.

00:14:19.295 --> 00:14:20.190
There's no more time.

00:14:20.190 --> 00:14:21.680
It's urgent.

00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:24.060
We have people depending on us.

00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:25.910
How are we going to respond?

00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:28.910
And if you have a
default decision making

00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:31.170
in the back of your
pocket, you can

00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:34.660
push back on those pressures
and make better decisions.

00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:37.160
And when you make better
decisions, and you're calm,

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:38.950
and you're able to
move forward, then

00:14:38.950 --> 00:14:44.080
people will build their referent
power that you have collected,

00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:47.796
you'll build that with them
and your expertise as well.

00:14:47.796 --> 00:14:49.020
So here's an example.

00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:53.610
I have a couple of default
decision-making trees

00:14:53.610 --> 00:14:58.365
I fall back on in
times of high pressure.

00:14:58.365 --> 00:14:59.740
Are the outcomes
of this decision

00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:03.410
going to matter in 10
minutes, 10 months, 10 years?

00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:05.850
And really, that's helping
me understand and respond

00:15:05.850 --> 00:15:08.870
appropriately to the
scope of whatever

00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:11.010
is creating that pressure,
driving the need to make

00:15:11.010 --> 00:15:12.660
that decision immediately.

00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:16.420
Another one, especially leading
products or leading product

00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:18.700
releases, is around
what does this

00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:23.530
mean to our employees, our
customers, our brand, right?

00:15:23.530 --> 00:15:26.320
So if you frame it that
way, then your decision

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:27.360
is really defensible.

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:31.840
All of this is about making
not the perfect decision,

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:36.770
but making a decision under
pressure and being defensible.

00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:39.800
I could be wrong, but I made
the decision, and here's why.

00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:41.491
Here's how I defend my decision.

00:15:41.491 --> 00:15:42.990
So that kind of
wraps back around to

00:15:42.990 --> 00:15:45.880
don't be afraid to take
the risk of being wrong.

00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:49.080
Ineffective ways of being
decisive under pressure

00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:51.320
are reacting emotionally.

00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:52.000
Hair on fire.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.170
Oh, my god, oh, my god,
what am I going to do?

00:15:54.170 --> 00:15:57.030
That actually diminishes
your expertise power.

00:15:57.030 --> 00:15:58.940
It diminishes your
referent power.

00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:01.542
And it makes other people
kind of like, ugh, I

00:16:01.542 --> 00:16:03.250
think the next time
we have an emergency,

00:16:03.250 --> 00:16:05.140
do I want that
person leading us?

00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:07.680
Blame shifting is something
I see that's ineffective.

00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:10.570
So I've seen very
senior executives get

00:16:10.570 --> 00:16:13.610
into a very important
decision that

00:16:13.610 --> 00:16:15.885
needs to be made under
pressure, and what they do,

00:16:15.885 --> 00:16:17.510
they just start
blaming everybody else.

00:16:17.510 --> 00:16:21.880
We wouldn't be here if
you hadn't done this.

00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:22.600
But we are here.

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:23.766
Now we need to move forward.

00:16:23.766 --> 00:16:26.730
So can we go back to
being constructive?

00:16:26.730 --> 00:16:30.500
Or blame absorbing-- I
also see this happen a lot.

00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:33.460
It's all my fault.
This is a disaster.

00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:34.820
I caused it.

00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:36.980
I'm just going to absorb
all the blame to me.

00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:40.540
Why is that an
ineffective technique?

00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:44.100
It's ineffective because
it's not always accurate.

00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:47.660
Very rarely do I find a
single point of failure

00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:49.700
in any kind of teamwork.

00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:52.900
And secondly, when you absorb
that blame, think about it

00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:55.094
this way, you're
depriving somebody else

00:16:55.094 --> 00:16:56.760
of learning lessons
of how to get better

00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:58.590
from whatever went wrong.

00:16:58.590 --> 00:17:00.600
So when you're decisive
under pressure,

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:03.540
if the first response
is it's all my fault,

00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:06.922
I've got to fix this all myself,
you're really not respecting

00:17:06.922 --> 00:17:08.630
the fact that the team
can come together,

00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:10.869
learn something, and do
better going forward.

00:17:10.869 --> 00:17:13.750
So being decisive
under pressure will

00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:18.040
be a way to build your
expertise and referent power.

00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:19.660
And if you can
find effective ways

00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:21.450
to just do that, just
get better at being

00:17:21.450 --> 00:17:25.910
decisive under pressure,
it will help you grow.

00:17:25.910 --> 00:17:30.380
The last one, the fourth
one, is beam confidence.

00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:35.140
There are effective ways to
do this and ineffective ways.

00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:37.770
I'm going to start with one of
the ineffective ways right now.

00:17:37.770 --> 00:17:44.640
And that's expecting that
time in a job equals mastery.

00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:46.500
It does not.

00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:48.920
If you think that
just being in the role

00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:52.170
is how you're going to
become the best at it,

00:17:52.170 --> 00:17:55.380
then you need to kind of
reflect back on what else

00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:58.340
you could be doing besides
just occupying that role.

00:17:58.340 --> 00:18:00.550
The effective way
to beam confidence

00:18:00.550 --> 00:18:02.760
is to really know
that you've got it.

00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:04.470
You know your stuff.

00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:06.930
And you do this by
honing your craft.

00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:09.820
You think methodically
about how am I

00:18:09.820 --> 00:18:12.620
going to be the best at this?

00:18:12.620 --> 00:18:15.290
Another way that
you beam confidence

00:18:15.290 --> 00:18:17.940
is how you interact with others.

00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:21.490
So if you are the person
that gets the emails

00:18:21.490 --> 00:18:24.200
and thinks that every email
that you've ever received

00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:27.430
is somehow a personal
attack on your credibility

00:18:27.430 --> 00:18:29.690
or your professionalism,
then you

00:18:29.690 --> 00:18:31.622
may need to step back
because that actually

00:18:31.622 --> 00:18:32.830
is sending the wrong message.

00:18:32.830 --> 00:18:35.140
That's sending the message that
you're not confident enough

00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:36.764
in who you are, the
decisions you make,

00:18:36.764 --> 00:18:38.710
and the role that you play.

00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:41.020
So how do you get better
of beaming confidence

00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:42.880
in those interactions?

00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:46.170
I think there's a lot
to be had from assuming

00:18:46.170 --> 00:18:48.130
positive intent with others.

00:18:48.130 --> 00:18:51.620
When you go into a situation
and assume positive intent

00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:53.140
in your interactions
with others,

00:18:53.140 --> 00:18:56.010
what you're really doing
isn't so much about saying,

00:18:56.010 --> 00:18:57.040
I trust you.

00:18:57.040 --> 00:19:01.000
What you're saying is, I trust
that whatever happens here,

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.390
I can rise above it.

00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:05.300
I trust my skills
to overcome this.

00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:06.940
So when you assume
positive intent,

00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:09.370
it's actually a lot more
about beaming confidence

00:19:09.370 --> 00:19:12.070
in who you are and
what you stand for.

00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:13.790
Another thing about
beaming confidence

00:19:13.790 --> 00:19:17.490
is sidestepping personal attacks
and bullying behaviors and not

00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:19.430
engaging with them.

00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:22.860
I see a lot of people
that are being bullied

00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:26.690
or they are having personal
attacks that come after them.

00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:28.510
And what they do is
they turn and they just

00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:31.800
go right into the
trap of getting

00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:34.914
into that line of thought.

00:19:34.914 --> 00:19:36.080
They start getting negative.

00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:37.950
They start getting destructive.

00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:41.830
A really confident person
says, OK, that's interesting.

00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:43.270
And then they just
keep moving on.

00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:46.680
You don't give credence to
those other types of behaviors.

00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:49.270
The last part I would say
about beaming confidence

00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:52.560
is lifting others
up as you climb.

00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:54.820
I know that I have
benefited greatly

00:19:54.820 --> 00:20:00.440
from very competent leaders who
said, we want to help you grow,

00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:02.050
and here's how we want to do it.

00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:03.800
And that has made
all the difference,

00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:05.685
and that's what I do
within my organization,

00:20:05.685 --> 00:20:09.520
too, is I want to know how do I
bring other people up and help

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:12.770
them grow their professional
leadership skills.

00:20:12.770 --> 00:20:15.120
That says about how you
feel about yourself, right?

00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:16.790
You're not threatened
by other people.

00:20:16.790 --> 00:20:20.310
The people that walk in the
door are not threats to you.

00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:23.290
They're actually coming
in to help you and grow

00:20:23.290 --> 00:20:27.130
and be a benefit to your
team and your mission.

00:20:27.130 --> 00:20:29.820
On the ineffective side,
when you paint yourself

00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:33.240
as a sole hero, a
lot of people think

00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:35.380
that means they're
so confident, right?

00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:36.320
I'm so confident.

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:38.560
I'm going to paint
myself as a sole hero.

00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:40.180
It's actually a
very thin veneer,

00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:41.760
and everybody sees through it.

00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:44.220
And it actually belies the
fact that a person doesn't

00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:47.140
have the confidence that they're
actually projecting, which

00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:51.030
I would say goes back to really
true authentic confidence

00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:54.380
comes from honing your
craft and assuming

00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:56.310
positive intent, right?

00:20:56.310 --> 00:20:57.620
So beam confidence.

00:20:57.620 --> 00:21:00.100
That's the fourth
kind of challenge

00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:02.928
to how you assert your
value as a technical leader.

00:21:05.490 --> 00:21:07.497
I put a little
summary slide up here,

00:21:07.497 --> 00:21:09.621
mostly because I know people
like to take pictures.

00:21:12.210 --> 00:21:15.440
But also just as a way to wrap
up some of these messages.

00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:19.750
You know, really asserting
your power as a technology

00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:22.580
professional-- and I put
product professional here,

00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:25.240
coming from my
background-- is own it.

00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:28.760
If that's what you
want to do, then do it.

00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:33.030
And it means honing your craft
so that it's authentic to you,

00:21:33.030 --> 00:21:34.690
and that confidence
is authentic.

00:21:34.690 --> 00:21:37.490
It's not that thin veneer
that sometimes we see.

00:21:37.490 --> 00:21:40.080
Defend your position.

00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:41.360
This is my comment here.

00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:45.640
Defensible but wrong will
beat quiet and scared,

00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:48.620
and it helps build
referent power, right?

00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:51.240
So you want to constantly
grow your power sources.

00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:52.840
You want to hold that power.

00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:55.420
And then you want to
use that influence.

00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:59.880
Sorry not sorry-- it is
unnecessary to apologize

00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:02.590
for having a
difference of opinion.

00:22:02.590 --> 00:22:05.740
This almost could be a
mantra that a lot of people I

00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:07.370
work with on a daily basis say.

00:22:07.370 --> 00:22:09.950
And I'm going to tell you
this is not specific to women.

00:22:09.950 --> 00:22:13.080
This is also-- I have
team members I coach,

00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:16.370
and I tell them, you
did an amazing job.

00:22:16.370 --> 00:22:17.570
You knew all the facts.

00:22:17.570 --> 00:22:19.120
You had the market down.

00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:22.010
You defended your decision to
go this way with the product,

00:22:22.010 --> 00:22:23.661
and then you apologized for it.

00:22:23.661 --> 00:22:24.160
Why?

00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:25.650
Why did you do that?

00:22:25.650 --> 00:22:27.400
So have that.

00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:31.430
Stand, own it, and
hold your position.

00:22:31.430 --> 00:22:35.170
Remember, can you help me
understand as a great way

00:22:35.170 --> 00:22:39.550
to listen and work that
constructive conflict.

00:22:39.550 --> 00:22:41.190
Can you help me understand?

00:22:41.190 --> 00:22:42.950
I'm respecting you
and your opinion,

00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:45.670
even though I may
disagree with it.

00:22:45.670 --> 00:22:47.560
And then build your
default decision tree.

00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:50.960
Have that idea in your head
that when you are under pressure

00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:52.860
and need to make
a decision, what

00:22:52.860 --> 00:22:56.330
are the things that matter,
so that in the moment

00:22:56.330 --> 00:23:00.820
you aren't overrun by the
panic of being under pressure.

00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:04.000
And then finally,
assume positive intent.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.630
You guys, you will
be right more often

00:23:06.630 --> 00:23:09.860
than you're wrong about
the tone or the nature

00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:11.442
or the motivations
of somebody else.

00:23:11.442 --> 00:23:12.900
And if you just
assume that they're

00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:15.870
coming into it with positive
intent and you react that way,

00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:18.900
it really will reflect
more on you than on them.

00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:22.040
And it builds relationships,
and your referent power.

00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:26.170
And that helps you grow
your influence, right?

00:23:26.170 --> 00:23:32.260
So my final comments on this
topic are be methodical.

00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:34.650
Build your value methodically.

00:23:34.650 --> 00:23:36.660
Just like with the
sources of power,

00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:38.656
you can think about
them categorically,

00:23:38.656 --> 00:23:41.030
and you can see that some of
them are better and stronger

00:23:41.030 --> 00:23:42.900
and you want to work on those.

00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:45.550
You can work on your craft.

00:23:45.550 --> 00:23:49.260
That is completely within
your realm of control.

00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:50.470
You can work on yourself.

00:23:50.470 --> 00:23:54.140
You can decide, regardless
of how much this person comes

00:23:54.140 --> 00:23:57.187
across being a jerk, I'm going
to assume positive intent,

00:23:57.187 --> 00:23:58.520
and we're going to keep working.

00:23:58.520 --> 00:23:59.650
You can make that decision.

00:23:59.650 --> 00:24:01.220
That's working on yourself.

00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:03.110
You can also work
on your network.

00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:05.720
Being here, reaching out,
getting to know people,

00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:08.490
that helps grow that
connection power.

00:24:08.490 --> 00:24:10.310
And then finally,
whenever you can,

00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:12.330
take the opportunity
to change the system.

00:24:12.330 --> 00:24:15.430
And it doesn't have to be huge.

00:24:15.430 --> 00:24:18.350
About a year ago, some women and
I were talking in the hallways

00:24:18.350 --> 00:24:21.610
and we said, there's just not
enough leadership training

00:24:21.610 --> 00:24:24.190
for growing our pipeline
of women leaders coming up

00:24:24.190 --> 00:24:25.100
through this company.

00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:26.640
And that is true for sales.

00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:27.630
It's true for product.

00:24:27.630 --> 00:24:29.830
It's true for working
in the data center.

00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:31.190
It's true across the board.

00:24:31.190 --> 00:24:32.800
What are we going
to do about that?

00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:36.080
And so we decided we would
band together and create

00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:38.120
an entrepreneurial
women's network.

00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:41.980
And we would go and lobby
for money from our CFO

00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:46.290
and our CEO to fund leadership
training opportunities

00:24:46.290 --> 00:24:48.890
for all the women and men in
our organization that we felt

00:24:48.890 --> 00:24:51.300
could benefit from it.

00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:55.200
And the recognition was amazing.

00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:56.260
We got a yes.

00:24:56.260 --> 00:25:00.540
And now there are programs that
we've helped launch internally.

00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:02.380
And it's a small system.

00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:03.710
It's an internal system.

00:25:03.710 --> 00:25:05.470
But we changed it.

00:25:05.470 --> 00:25:07.760
So we had an idea,
and now that's just

00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:09.474
part of what people
really look forward

00:25:09.474 --> 00:25:11.140
to coming in and
working in our company.

00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:13.639
They're like, oh, you guys have
this entrepreneurial women's

00:25:13.639 --> 00:25:16.640
network that sponsors its
own leadership training.

00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:17.950
That's really terrific.

00:25:17.950 --> 00:25:20.740
So we didn't wait for the
system to actually change.

00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:22.940
We went outside and
changed it ourselves.

00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:26.174
And I think that if you
looked into your organization

00:25:26.174 --> 00:25:28.590
or in your life, you would
find an opportunity to do that.

00:25:28.590 --> 00:25:31.640
And again, it doesn't
have to be shaking

00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:32.980
the world to its foundations.

00:25:32.980 --> 00:25:34.470
But you can make that impact.

00:25:34.470 --> 00:25:38.990
We've got about 200
now, women enrolled,

00:25:38.990 --> 00:25:40.980
and that's great, right?

00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:43.360
That's 200 more
than were last year.

00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:44.829
So change the system.

00:25:44.829 --> 00:25:46.870
So these are the messages
I would leave you with,

00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:49.410
as you think about
asserting your value

00:25:49.410 --> 00:25:50.980
as a technical leader.

00:25:50.980 --> 00:25:52.290
These are behaviors.

00:25:52.290 --> 00:25:54.710
And a lot of these
behaviors you control.

00:25:54.710 --> 00:25:58.180
And there's so much in our lives
that we just don't control.

00:25:58.180 --> 00:26:00.864
There are so many things
that we just can't influence.

00:26:00.864 --> 00:26:02.280
But these things
we can influence.

00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:05.950
And we can and we can do it
thoughtfully and methodically.

00:26:05.950 --> 00:26:08.400
So that's the end of
my discussion here.

00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:10.000
But I want to just
one last thing say,

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:10.958
please connect with me.

00:26:10.958 --> 00:26:12.890
Let's use this
opportunity, during lunch

00:26:12.890 --> 00:26:15.850
and during the
reception, to meet.

00:26:15.850 --> 00:26:17.850
I would love to meet as
many of you as I can.

00:26:17.850 --> 00:26:18.350
Thank you.

00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:21.652
[APPLAUSE]

00:26:21.652 --> 00:26:22.360
MODERATOR: Great.

00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:24.032
Thank you again.

00:26:24.032 --> 00:26:26.490
And we'll do the same that we
did for our previous speaker.

00:26:26.490 --> 00:26:27.380
We'll take questions.

00:26:27.380 --> 00:26:30.970
We have about 10
minutes for questions.

00:26:30.970 --> 00:26:32.250
We have some mic runners.

00:26:32.250 --> 00:26:35.210
I see someone in the middle.

00:26:35.210 --> 00:26:36.210
Maybe hidden over there.

00:26:39.795 --> 00:26:40.336
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:26:40.336 --> 00:26:42.020
I have a question.

00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:43.690
You mentioned charisma.

00:26:43.690 --> 00:26:46.360
And extroverted charisma
is very obvious.

00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:49.170
But you also mentioned
introverted charisma.

00:26:49.170 --> 00:26:49.990
What is that?

00:26:49.990 --> 00:26:51.710
And how do you grow it?

00:26:51.710 --> 00:26:55.900
SARAH MCCRARY: Ah, OK,
thank you for that question.

00:26:55.900 --> 00:26:59.010
I consider myself an
introvert, and here's why.

00:26:59.010 --> 00:27:02.790
I get a lot of energy
from being by myself.

00:27:02.790 --> 00:27:07.640
And at the end of the
day-- and I spend 10 hours

00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:11.200
during the workday connecting
with people, collaborating.

00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:12.620
And it's exhausting for me.

00:27:12.620 --> 00:27:15.630
At the end of the day,
I want to be by myself,

00:27:15.630 --> 00:27:18.332
and that's where I recharge.

00:27:18.332 --> 00:27:20.290
My brother, on the other
hand, is an extrovert.

00:27:20.290 --> 00:27:23.380
He hates to be alone.

00:27:23.380 --> 00:27:25.930
I know when he's not with
friends or with family

00:27:25.930 --> 00:27:28.401
because he's calling me.

00:27:28.401 --> 00:27:29.477
And I'm like, what?

00:27:29.477 --> 00:27:30.310
Are you by yourself?

00:27:30.310 --> 00:27:30.810
Yes.

00:27:30.810 --> 00:27:32.620
Oh, OK.

00:27:32.620 --> 00:27:34.640
So he gets his energy
from being with people.

00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:36.800
He likes to make
those connections.

00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:39.480
That's how I define
extrovert and introvert.

00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:42.400
So I think introverted
charisma really

00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:45.410
can come from the
quieter interactions.

00:27:45.410 --> 00:27:48.410
And maybe "quieter" is not
the right word, but the more

00:27:48.410 --> 00:27:51.030
one-on-one interactions, right?

00:27:51.030 --> 00:27:55.300
So for a long time I was
like-- coming to an event

00:27:55.300 --> 00:28:01.147
like this would just have
really scared me because I don't

00:28:01.147 --> 00:28:02.230
know how to do small talk.

00:28:02.230 --> 00:28:04.880
I'm like, how do you-- but
then I had to learn that.

00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:07.390
Because part of my
role in my company

00:28:07.390 --> 00:28:11.367
is to go out and go to
industry-type meetings and go

00:28:11.367 --> 00:28:12.950
meet customers and
go where they're at

00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:15.300
and go learn new
things and meet people.

00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:17.090
So I had to learn
how to do that.

00:28:17.090 --> 00:28:19.420
And what I finally realized--
there was a book recently

00:28:19.420 --> 00:28:21.310
called "Quiet."

00:28:21.310 --> 00:28:23.840
Yeah, so a lot people--
and it was like, what

00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:25.885
introverts really like are.

00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:32.720
We want to connect about things
that are interesting to us,

00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:33.940
right?

00:28:33.940 --> 00:28:37.637
We don't necessarily want
to talk in shallow terms.

00:28:37.637 --> 00:28:39.220
We want to sit with
someone, and like,

00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:40.500
I want to know
everything about you.

00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:41.958
I want to know
where you come from,

00:28:41.958 --> 00:28:44.370
what you're interested in,
what's going on in your life.

00:28:44.370 --> 00:28:45.745
And that's hard
to do when you've

00:28:45.745 --> 00:28:47.820
got 50 people
around you, when you

00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:49.570
want to make those
one-on-one connections.

00:28:49.570 --> 00:28:51.610
But I think that's
where introverts go,

00:28:51.610 --> 00:28:54.410
is that what I find
I do in my work--

00:28:54.410 --> 00:28:59.420
so I'll translate this to
my work-- I call people.

00:28:59.420 --> 00:29:01.010
And instead of
scheduling meetings

00:29:01.010 --> 00:29:04.580
with two or three or
four sometimes 50 people,

00:29:04.580 --> 00:29:05.730
I just will call people.

00:29:05.730 --> 00:29:09.018
I've got time on my
calendar in the morning.

00:29:09.018 --> 00:29:11.080
And I just hold that time.

00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:13.380
And whoever I think I
need to call and talk to,

00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:15.480
to make that one-on-one
connection, I do it.

00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:19.230
So there was a guy I talked
to on Friday morning, Jerry.

00:29:19.230 --> 00:29:22.757
He leads some of our
product engineering teams.

00:29:22.757 --> 00:29:24.340
And I need to work
with him, because I

00:29:24.340 --> 00:29:27.570
want to bring in some new
design talent for a product

00:29:27.570 --> 00:29:28.700
that we're working on.

00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:30.720
And we just haven't
been connecting.

00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:32.637
And I just called Jerry.

00:29:32.637 --> 00:29:34.470
I was like, Jerry, do
you have time to talk?

00:29:34.470 --> 00:29:35.810
And he's like, yeah.

00:29:35.810 --> 00:29:38.020
And within 25 minutes,
I learned he's

00:29:38.020 --> 00:29:40.520
going to Disneyland with his
daughter over spring break,

00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:42.740
and he's really looking
forward to having tea

00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:43.960
with the princesses.

00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:46.070
And I was like, seriously?

00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:46.800
That's amazing.

00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:48.310
Yeah, and then he plays guitar.

00:29:48.310 --> 00:29:50.240
Then he gave me this
really-- I just started

00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:51.570
learning to play the guitar.

00:29:51.570 --> 00:29:54.914
And then about 20 minutes
in our conversation, I said,

00:29:54.914 --> 00:29:56.330
Jerry, by the way,
I called, and I

00:29:56.330 --> 00:29:59.382
want to talk about this
issue with the design team.

00:29:59.382 --> 00:30:00.590
And he's like, you know what?

00:30:00.590 --> 00:30:02.131
I've been thinking
about this, Sarah.

00:30:02.131 --> 00:30:04.570
And within five minutes,
we solved our problem.

00:30:04.570 --> 00:30:07.240
And out of that
conversation, I know

00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:09.570
I grew my influence with Jerry.

00:30:09.570 --> 00:30:12.240
And I know it's
because we started

00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:13.480
developing that relationship.

00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:17.470
It's also part of that charisma
that an introvert can build,

00:30:17.470 --> 00:30:20.740
that I'm interested in you
personally kind of charisma.

00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:21.980
Is that helpful?

00:30:21.980 --> 00:30:22.930
OK, thank you.

00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:29.780
AUDIENCE: Hi, so my question
is about workplace manners.

00:30:29.780 --> 00:30:31.480
I work on a technical
support team.

00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:34.810
And so me and my team
members, we're very polite.

00:30:34.810 --> 00:30:39.290
We use please and thank you
a lot and internally as well.

00:30:39.290 --> 00:30:42.890
And I feel like everybody else
in the company, developers

00:30:42.890 --> 00:30:45.370
and the IT team,
I feel like it's

00:30:45.370 --> 00:30:47.940
perceived as a sign of weakness
that we say please and thank

00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:52.160
you a lot, and that we're looked
at as weaker for saying thank

00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:54.680
you, because we need the help.

00:30:54.680 --> 00:31:01.370
So do you have any advice
on how to handle that?

00:31:01.370 --> 00:31:03.780
SARAH MCCRARY: So let
me ask you a question.

00:31:03.780 --> 00:31:06.900
Do you feel like you are
ineffective because you're

00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:09.380
more polite, or do you feel
like you're more effective

00:31:09.380 --> 00:31:10.334
because you're polite?

00:31:10.334 --> 00:31:11.750
AUDIENCE: Less
effective probably.

00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:14.660
SARAH MCCRARY: You feel like
it's making you less effective?

00:31:14.660 --> 00:31:16.350
AUDIENCE: Well, in
regards to power

00:31:16.350 --> 00:31:19.050
and being looked
at as an expert,

00:31:19.050 --> 00:31:21.100
I feel like we're not
taking as seriously.

00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:23.600
And we're looked
at as if we always

00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:26.675
know less because
we're asking questions.

00:31:26.675 --> 00:31:27.800
SARAH MCCRARY: Interesting.

00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:31.520
So I guess what comes to my
head is because we're not

00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:34.570
being arrogant jerks, we're
looked at being less expert?

00:31:34.570 --> 00:31:35.880
AUDIENCE: Yeah, exactly.

00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:37.742
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:37.742 --> 00:31:39.700
SARAH MCCRARY: Well,
maybe you start with that.

00:31:39.700 --> 00:31:44.940
So we're not arrogant jerks,
but we are experts at-- I

00:31:44.940 --> 00:31:50.440
relate to this because about
four years ago, the CFO pulled

00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:53.800
me aside and said--
so I moved from Texas,

00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:55.900
and I grew up in
Texas and New Mexico.

00:31:55.900 --> 00:31:59.330
I still say yes, sir, and
no, ma'am to my parents.

00:31:59.330 --> 00:32:00.930
That's how I was raised.

00:32:00.930 --> 00:32:06.055
And when I moved to New Jersey
a few years ago, oh, my gosh--

00:32:06.055 --> 00:32:08.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.870
So the CFO pulls me aside, and
she was our first female CFO,

00:32:10.870 --> 00:32:13.580
and she said, listen,
she's like, I got it.

00:32:13.580 --> 00:32:15.774
But these guys are going
to just tear you apart

00:32:15.774 --> 00:32:17.440
if you keep saying,
yes, sir or no ma'am

00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:19.690
because it just diminishes you.

00:32:19.690 --> 00:32:21.710
You look like you're
subservient to them.

00:32:21.710 --> 00:32:23.820
And I was like, oh my
gosh, OK, thank you

00:32:23.820 --> 00:32:25.300
for pointing that out, Maria.

00:32:25.300 --> 00:32:27.700
I'm going to figure out
how to work with this,

00:32:27.700 --> 00:32:31.000
because it is authentic
to me, and it's true to me

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:31.910
to be polite.

00:32:31.910 --> 00:32:35.070
And being polite is saying,
yes, sir, no, ma'am.

00:32:35.070 --> 00:32:37.140
And I don't just
do that to people

00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:38.390
who are ranked higher than me.

00:32:38.390 --> 00:32:42.840
I apply that equally across
the board to everybody, right?

00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:44.651
So I had to really
figure this problem out

00:32:44.651 --> 00:32:46.150
because I think
it's similar, right?

00:32:46.150 --> 00:32:48.024
We're being looked at
as being less effective

00:32:48.024 --> 00:32:52.210
or somehow reducing
our power base.

00:32:52.210 --> 00:32:54.290
So I did not come up
with a perfect answer.

00:32:54.290 --> 00:33:01.160
I know you're waiting on
that, but what I did do was

00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:04.060
I asked some of the
people around me.

00:33:04.060 --> 00:33:06.460
So I worked very closely
with our executive committee

00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:07.410
at the time.

00:33:07.410 --> 00:33:09.670
And it just so happened
that two of them, one

00:33:09.670 --> 00:33:11.530
was from Nashville,
one was from Alabama,

00:33:11.530 --> 00:33:13.140
and one was from New Jersey.

00:33:13.140 --> 00:33:15.920
And the guys from
Alabama and Nashville,

00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:18.830
it's kind of like these
are regional cultures.

00:33:21.710 --> 00:33:23.540
Also, they're both
men, and they're

00:33:23.540 --> 00:33:26.770
both aged 25 years
older than me,

00:33:26.770 --> 00:33:29.370
they both say yes,
sir and no, ma'am.

00:33:29.370 --> 00:33:33.370
So why is it bad
for me to do that?

00:33:33.370 --> 00:33:36.910
So anyway, we actually
had a talk about it.

00:33:36.910 --> 00:33:41.464
We had kind of a team
discussion about it.

00:33:41.464 --> 00:33:44.370
It helped me to put
it out on the table

00:33:44.370 --> 00:33:46.090
and say, guys, I'm
hearing this feedback

00:33:46.090 --> 00:33:50.290
that because my regional
culture is to say these things,

00:33:50.290 --> 00:33:53.850
that you guys think
that that's bad.

00:33:53.850 --> 00:33:56.425
And I got some empathy
from some of the teams that

00:33:56.425 --> 00:34:00.150
were like, no, actually
we don't feel that way.

00:34:00.150 --> 00:34:04.960
In your particular case,
I'm not sure of the players.

00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:08.989
If it's possible for you
to call it out and say,

00:34:08.989 --> 00:34:10.949
I feel like this is going on.

00:34:10.949 --> 00:34:13.069
Can we break it down
and deal with it?

00:34:13.069 --> 00:34:14.860
If that's comfortable
for you, that kind of

00:34:14.860 --> 00:34:16.943
goes back to that being
comfortable with conflict,

00:34:16.943 --> 00:34:21.830
because some people, maybe if
you just call out for them.

00:34:21.830 --> 00:34:25.270
Otherwise, there may be people
here that have really good

00:34:25.270 --> 00:34:27.320
responses that I don't.

00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:28.320
So what's your name?

00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:29.044
AUDIENCE: Nicole.

00:34:29.044 --> 00:34:29.960
SARAH MCCRARY: Nicole?

00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:33.330
If anyone has the great
answer for Nicole,

00:34:33.330 --> 00:34:34.385
she's right over there.

00:34:34.385 --> 00:34:35.541
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:35.541 --> 00:34:37.082
AUDIENCE: I was
actually going to-- I

00:34:37.082 --> 00:34:42.314
had a follow-up question to this
last one and also a response.

00:34:42.314 --> 00:34:44.730
So I'm a developer at a startup.

00:34:44.730 --> 00:34:48.370
And we're moving
really fast, a lot

00:34:48.370 --> 00:34:50.850
of pressure, very young team.

00:34:50.850 --> 00:34:53.920
And we had some
issues with that.

00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:56.699
So one of the things that
we actually did was we

00:34:56.699 --> 00:35:01.120
had a giant team retro
about how we use language.

00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:05.700
And it was kind of shocking,
especially because the majority

00:35:05.700 --> 00:35:07.140
of the team is men.

00:35:07.140 --> 00:35:10.990
And there are certain
things that for some

00:35:10.990 --> 00:35:14.360
of the women on the team they
felt like were maybe a little

00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:17.740
pejorative, like
some of the lingo,

00:35:17.740 --> 00:35:20.730
like even calling someone
a rock star, right?

00:35:20.730 --> 00:35:25.720
There's something
singularly anti-team

00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:29.910
about having a rock star and
praising that kind of behavior

00:35:29.910 --> 00:35:33.100
because it's the
cowboy behavior.

00:35:33.100 --> 00:35:35.580
And people just didn't know.

00:35:35.580 --> 00:35:37.452
It was really interesting .

00:35:37.452 --> 00:35:39.160
People didn't know
what they were saying,

00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:42.980
and we were able to
create a kind of guide.

00:35:42.980 --> 00:35:44.452
And some people
also felt that that

00:35:44.452 --> 00:35:46.660
was like a little prescriptive,
and that was actually

00:35:46.660 --> 00:35:50.670
what I wanted to ask you, If
you've ever had a dictionary

00:35:50.670 --> 00:35:52.660
conversation about,
like, we use this word,

00:35:52.660 --> 00:35:53.880
but what does this word mean?

00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:55.520
And how do people feel about it?

00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:57.830
And we're going to decide
not to use this word.

00:35:57.830 --> 00:36:00.707
Like on our team, we don't
use that word anymore.

00:36:00.707 --> 00:36:02.290
So I didn't know if
you felt that that

00:36:02.290 --> 00:36:04.399
was like too prescriptive or?

00:36:04.399 --> 00:36:06.690
SARAH MCCRARY: First of all,
so what you did is I think

00:36:06.690 --> 00:36:08.320
is you called it out, right?

00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:09.370
Which was kind of what
we were talking about.

00:36:09.370 --> 00:36:12.010
So there's kind of a vote for
the column of just call it out.

00:36:12.010 --> 00:36:13.860
Be brave and call it out.

00:36:13.860 --> 00:36:17.860
Secondly, I have had that
conversation two-fold.

00:36:17.860 --> 00:36:20.840
One was about the F-word.

00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:23.420
So when I took over
a team, I came in,

00:36:23.420 --> 00:36:26.140
and actually the CEO departed.

00:36:26.140 --> 00:36:27.140
He was the founding CEO.

00:36:27.140 --> 00:36:28.290
It was really rough.

00:36:28.290 --> 00:36:30.899
And I came in, and I
found that there was

00:36:30.899 --> 00:36:32.190
a lot of really rough language.

00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:34.530
And I just said, hey,
guys, just so you know,

00:36:34.530 --> 00:36:38.560
when you speak to me using that
word, the effectiveness of what

00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:40.840
you're trying to
communicate to me drops.

00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:44.770
So either you're OK with that
or just take it in consideration

00:36:44.770 --> 00:36:48.120
if you want me to act the way--
if you want to influence me,

00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:49.510
don't use that word.

00:36:49.510 --> 00:36:51.260
Second one was the word "hero."

00:36:51.260 --> 00:36:53.380
We had a hero culture.

00:36:53.380 --> 00:36:54.780
And here's what I think.

00:36:54.780 --> 00:36:56.610
When you have a hero
culture or a rock star

00:36:56.610 --> 00:36:58.850
or whatever, I don't
think it's bad to say

00:36:58.850 --> 00:37:02.610
to someone in my team,
oh, you're a rock star.

00:37:02.610 --> 00:37:04.470
Your contribution was great.

00:37:04.470 --> 00:37:06.980
But when you're talking
about the whole culture,

00:37:06.980 --> 00:37:10.220
a hero culture is the opposite
of a teamwork culture.

00:37:10.220 --> 00:37:11.910
And what I had to
get people to realize

00:37:11.910 --> 00:37:14.840
is you guys are
promoting that someone

00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:16.530
has to come in
and save our bacon

00:37:16.530 --> 00:37:18.400
through their
individual efforts.

00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:21.570
And what that's depriving
us of is a strong team,

00:37:21.570 --> 00:37:24.652
because a strong team
never gets to that point.

00:37:24.652 --> 00:37:26.110
So we've got to
figure out whenever

00:37:26.110 --> 00:37:28.054
we see this hero behavior
having to come in,

00:37:28.054 --> 00:37:29.220
we've got to figure out why.

00:37:29.220 --> 00:37:31.660
That's a signal that
something's not working.

00:37:31.660 --> 00:37:33.770
So it's not exactly the
dictionary conversation

00:37:33.770 --> 00:37:34.920
I think that you had.

00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:36.860
But I love that
you called it out.

00:37:36.860 --> 00:37:39.300
Call it for what it is and
talk about effectiveness.

00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:41.910
Is it making as effective as
a team to keep going like this

00:37:41.910 --> 00:37:42.496
or not?

00:37:42.496 --> 00:37:44.370
And everybody's team's
going to be different.

00:37:44.370 --> 00:37:49.179
What your teams
tolerate-- so some teams

00:37:49.179 --> 00:37:50.220
might say, you know what?

00:37:50.220 --> 00:37:53.429
I'm a ninja, or I'm
the princess of data.

00:37:53.429 --> 00:37:54.970
That's awesome if
that works for them

00:37:54.970 --> 00:37:56.219
and that's effective for them.

00:37:56.219 --> 00:37:58.550
But another team might have
those exact same constructs

00:37:58.550 --> 00:38:00.080
and go, wait a minute.

00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:01.370
That's not effective for us.

00:38:01.370 --> 00:38:04.216
We do not want to be called data
princesses or whatever it is.

00:38:04.216 --> 00:38:06.340
But somebody else might
say, yes, that's what I am,

00:38:06.340 --> 00:38:07.450
and I rock it.

00:38:07.450 --> 00:38:09.270
So it's all local.

00:38:09.270 --> 00:38:10.947
Don't be afraid to call it out.

00:38:10.947 --> 00:38:13.280
And I think that's the whole
message is have the courage

00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:16.570
to call it out.

00:38:16.570 --> 00:38:19.093
I've got so many hands.

00:38:19.093 --> 00:38:19.634
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:38:19.634 --> 00:38:21.675
MODERATOR: Last-- this
will be the last question.

00:38:23.744 --> 00:38:25.410
SARAH MCCRARY: I'm
sticking around here,

00:38:25.410 --> 00:38:26.780
so if you got your hand
up and you want to chat,

00:38:26.780 --> 00:38:28.030
I would love to talk with you.

00:38:28.030 --> 00:38:29.760
AUDIENCE: Hi, thank
you for the talk.

00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:32.200
I was wondering if
from your experience

00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:36.030
there are any behaviors
or ineffective behaviors

00:38:36.030 --> 00:38:38.970
that women engage in
more often than men?

00:38:38.970 --> 00:38:42.880
Just so that we can
keep those in mind.

00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:46.090
SARAH MCCRARY: Everything
that I talked about here today

00:38:46.090 --> 00:38:49.280
I have seen in
both men and women,

00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:55.410
maybe not always in
the same frequency.

00:38:55.410 --> 00:38:58.055
So I hesitate to say
because you're a woman,

00:38:58.055 --> 00:38:59.930
this is what you're
doing that's ineffective.

00:38:59.930 --> 00:39:02.040
But I would say every
thing that I put up here

00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:06.420
on the board today is
something that I've experienced

00:39:06.420 --> 00:39:08.550
or I've observed,
or I may have done

00:39:08.550 --> 00:39:10.480
that ineffective thing myself.

00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:14.600
And you can take
that as a takeaway.

00:39:14.600 --> 00:39:20.020
I've worked in
mostly environments

00:39:20.020 --> 00:39:23.320
where female leadership
was in the minority.

00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:26.030
So just sometimes the frequency
of what you get to observe

00:39:26.030 --> 00:39:28.140
is different.

00:39:28.140 --> 00:39:31.540
But I would say pick one of
these that resonated with you

00:39:31.540 --> 00:39:34.620
and work on it.

00:39:34.620 --> 00:39:37.006
I think that was
the last one, right?

00:39:37.006 --> 00:39:40.122
MODERATOR: Yes, that was it.

00:39:40.122 --> 00:39:43.384
AUDIENCE: Will you be putting
the slides up somewhere for us.

00:39:43.384 --> 00:39:45.050
SARAH MCCRARY: Are
the slides available?

00:39:45.050 --> 00:39:46.060
MODERATOR: I'm not
sure if the slides

00:39:46.060 --> 00:39:46.770
are going to be available.

00:39:46.770 --> 00:39:48.530
I can find that out
and let you guys know.

00:39:48.530 --> 00:39:51.705
Yeah, I don't know when their--
what the next steps are.

00:39:51.705 --> 00:39:52.580
So thank you so much.

00:39:52.580 --> 00:39:53.160
SARAH MCCRARY: Thank you, guys.

00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:53.760
[APPLAUSE]

00:39:53.760 --> 00:40:01.010
