the US making sure the infrastructure is
repaired so we're not losing water and

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179
repaired so we're not losing water and
 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:31.700
repaired so we're not losing water and
we're not pumping out dirty water from

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710

you know the more they trust their tap
water the less they're likely to do that

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120
water the less they're likely to do that
 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.639
water the less they're likely to do that
which means you stop pumping the

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649
which means you stop pumping the
 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.310

a disaster because it used chemicals and
 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.190
a disaster because it used chemicals and
those chemicals needed way more water so

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200
those chemicals needed way more water so
 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.750
those chemicals needed way more water so
that you could disperse the chemicals

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760
that you could disperse the chemicals
 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.230
