00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.320
 QQ music has been constantly pursuing breakthroughs 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.740
 I think this is also the reason why it has been popular in the past ten years. 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:15.700
 I am Abao, the head of the Android team platform group. 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:20.360
 Every breakthrough in the product is inseparable from the creativity, research and development and platform power 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.360
 So our team has always been very concerned 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.280
 Google’s technology development and version updates on Android 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.080
 And try to let users enjoy the new features of the new system as soon as possible. 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.640
 This QQ music Android 9 version adaptation 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.960
 It is led by our group. 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:37.360
 I am Shawn. 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.360
 Is an engineer for Android 9 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.460
 From the DP1 version of P we started to pay attention 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.460
 Behavior changes and new features of the new system 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.140
 And start the adaptation work in the DP2 version. 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:47.980
 Support for full screen 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.100
 And the addition of new features such as the native system notification bar style 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.420
 Let our users feel the evolution of the platform for the first time. 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.860
 Especially the latter 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.280
 From the user who experienced the native system notification bar 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.540
 We have received a lot of praise 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.460
 From the developer's point of view 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.780
 The Android Studio experience has also become better and more powerful. 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:06.780
 Such as the Memory Profiler tool 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.900
 Let's make it easier to analyze memory 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.580
 Plus features such as JNI layer memory allocation real-time monitoring 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.640
 Make QQ music's memory optimization work very smooth 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.080
 Music app usually has a foreground process and background playback process 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.080
 Want to meet Android 9's requirements for background execution restrictions 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.260
 Renovation involving these two processes 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:31.480
 We combed and classified the data transfer and interface calls between the two processes. 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.360
 In the end, it not only meets the requirements of background execution restrictions. 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.940
 And in some extra scenes, it won’t pull up and keep alive. 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.200
 Can save more than 50% of memory usage in some scenarios 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.100
 We have always been concerned about new languages ​​like Kotlin. 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.940
 Currently, the new features in our project are basically written in Kotlin. 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.100
 This brings a lot of benefits to our development. 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.540
 For example, the average number of lines of code can be reduced by as much as 25%. 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.920
 And it can also reduce the abnormality of the null pointer by about 50%. 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.980
 Presumably, in the future, Kotlin’s share of our projects will grow rapidly. 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:05.680
 The direction of Android evolution is a more robust and secure system behavior 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.600
 Lower power consumption and better user experience 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.920
 We have witnessed on this way forward. 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.080
 More powerful toolchain and support for the developer ecosystem 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:18.500
 We believe in the open and continuous evolution of Android 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.460
 QQ concerts continue to give users a more exciting music experience
