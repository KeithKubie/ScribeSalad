Speaker 1:          00:00:00       [inaudible] joining me today is the president of the Hertzel Institute in Jerusalem, the Director of the John Templeton Foundation project in Jewish Philosophical Theology, and the author of several books, including the virtue of nationalism. Your arm has xone. Welcome to the Rubin report. Thanks for having me. It's great to be here. I am glad to have you here because as I said to you in the green room just a moment ago, you're one of about 12 people that I see on Twitter that doesn't completely enrage me. You actually make a little bit of sense on that Twitter machine. That's the highest compliment. I can positively pay any of that, that that's a pretty serious compliment. And I don't know how many people would agree with you, but I'm glad finally to meet with that background. That's that. That's wonderful. Thank you. Yeah. So, okay. So before we get into the book, and it's called the virtue of nationalism, and just even just saying the word nationalism sort of sets bells off for a lot of people.

Speaker 1:          00:00:54       So we're gonna, we're going kind of, uh, quantify and qualify what that word actually means. Uh, you were born in Israel, you live in Jerusalem. Now. Tell me a little bit about your background. Well, in between the being born in Israel and living in Jerusalem, I actually, you can, you can hear the, my Irish American education not to fully Israeli accent. Yeah. So I, I grew up in, uh, in Princeton, New Jersey and, uh, went to school there. I met my wife there, uh, uh, did a doctorate at Rutgers and you're buying in political theory and um, and then, uh, Julian, I moved to Israel. We, uh, I worked for a while for net to now for a few years, uh, quite, quite awhile ago already. Uh, and then set up a, uh, a conservative think tank called the Shalom Center, which did about 20 years of of work trying to figure out what Israeli and Jewish conservatism would, would be like.

Speaker 1:          00:01:53       We have nine kids and, uh, which is probably the, the, the, the biggest achievement. And I've been kind of pulled back. You've, you've noticed in the last few years pulled back into American and European, uh, issues, because, you know, for, for most of my life I felt like Israel was the front lines and that, you know, that that's where I was really needed. And these days, like for the first time in my life, I feel that, you know, America and Europe are actually kind of in worse shape than Israel is. So what do you mean by that? How was Israel at the front lines where that's now shifted is really used to be a, uh, I mean, it still is to an extent a, a, a strong and uh, I'm sorry, as a small and struggling country, um, in, in a sense like the, the edge between, uh, the, the order of the Western world and kind of kind of, uh, uh, uh, chaotic bedlam and ended a little, uh, uh, needed a lot of help in order to strengthen itself.

Speaker 1:          00:02:54       Uh, America looked fine for most of that time. And, uh, today I think the situations almost flipped where Israel is the strongest that it's ever been. And in a lot of ways, uh, as, as, as defeated many of its, uh, of the problems the dog did in the last generation. Um, and, uh, and America's fraying and, and the UK is fraying. And, you know, I don't have to tell you, I mean, it's not like, uh, Israel is, is, is going to do well if, if, you know, the entire west kind of disintegrates. So, um, so I've spent the last few years, uh, and that, that's how we know each other through, through, through, through Twitter and, and, uh, uh, writings that are directed and trying to, uh, to help American, the UK and other, other western countries with the issues that I think are facing them now. So we're going to spend most of the interview, obviously talking about issues, but nine kids living in Jerusalem, what's living in Jerusalem?

Speaker 1:          00:03:56       Like, I feel like it's probably, maybe not, probably, maybe, maybe exactly the most misunderstood place on planet earth for good reason. Oh, Gosh. I mean it's, it's, uh, in, in some ways it's just a dream, you know, I mean, I, I, I walk on Friday night with my, uh, uh, we have, uh, uh, twin twin 10 year olds, and I walk with them to synagogue. We walked down the hill to synagogue and, uh, and you can see the whole city from, from where we are, cause it's kind of on a hill. And, um, and uh, you know, for, for, for a Jew it's some, it's really kind of a miracle that after a couple of thousand years in which my ancestors were, were praying, please God bring us back so that one day we'll be able to, you know, to, to see the Jews returned to Jerusalem and we actually get to see it.

Speaker 1:          00:04:56       So it's, it's incredibly moving and it never loses its, it's magic. But, um, you know, on the other hand, it's also, you know, it's also a very real place in, in, in, in a very real political location. And, um, uh, today everything is basically, you know, quiet and peaceful and Jerusalem pretty much all the time. But, um, you know, just if you go, go, go back just to the mid two thousands, uh, we had a period where there were literally bombs going off in the cafes and the buses of, of the city every day. And, uh, and when, uh, Israel invaded, uh, Bethlehem, um, to put in an end to this, my, my wife and I, then we were living on the southern part of the city. And, um, you know, we walked hand in hand up to a hill from which we could see the, the, uh, Israeli armor entering the city and the, the tanks shooting.

Speaker 1:          00:05:53       And W I mean, it's like what you see on television, except we just sat there and watched it with it, with our own eyes. Um, so, uh, you know, we had six months at that time in which we had helicopter helicopters patrolling over our house every night. And, uh, and so it's both things. It's both. Um, the, it, it, it's both the front lines of civilization and, uh, and you can feel the fragility of, you know, what we've built. We can, you can feel that it's fragile. And, and know that nothing is certain about what's going to happen next. On the one hand, on the other hand, it, you know, you on a daily basis, you're connecting to a history of thousands of years and to, uh, you know, biblical hopes and aspirations that you know, that for, for, for people in, in America, it's mostly school books, but for, you know, the things that you learned as a kid in, in, in school or in Sunday school or someplace, but, uh, or you hear from your grandparents. But here we're really doing it will really, uh, recreating, uh, uh, a Jewish country after thousands of years. So, uh, it's, it's the highest and the lows and, and it's an extraordinary life.

Speaker 2:          00:07:08       Do you think in a weird way that the threat of bombings or terrorism or whatever else is going on or the general seemingly existential threat because it's such a small country actually helps the ingenuity that comes at Israel? Because I remember I was there a few years ago during the stabbing sprees and I went right into the old city of Jerusalem and you know, my mom was texting me, you know, you, you don't have to go there. And I just went right in and I remembered there was a certain tension, you know, it was kind of looking around, but I went into the Arab quarter and I walked through the gate and somebody had just been stabbed there the day before and I thought, you just, you just have to keep going. If people can live like this, I can certainly do it for one day of my life, for a couple of hours in my life.

Speaker 1:          00:07:53       Yeah. I, I, first of all, I'm, I'm real pleased that you did that. You know, a lot of people just get scared and, and, and, and, you know, seeing something, seeing something on television, sing some violence and then deciding you're going to live your life. You're going to decide where you're going to go and what you're going to do and what you're going to save because you saw something on TV and got scared. I, I mean, I understand it, but, but I don't think it's the best way to live. And, um,

Speaker 2:          00:08:22       well you can also see that these people live on top of each other. These quarters are right on top of each other. And I had CANASTA and the Arab quarter and I had falafel in the Jewish quarter and everyone's existing and not killing each other. I mean, that's the truth. Truth,

Speaker 1:          00:08:34       right? They, uh, they do. Uh, but our, you know, our future depends on, on, you know, countless little act of, of, you know, of bravery like that. Like, I'm not going to be deterred. I'm going to go eat, I'm going to go eat that fell off. I'm going to lead a normal life here. That's what builds the normal life is people like you saying that. So, uh, it's, uh, there really is a, uh, a daily effort which, um, uh, which is built on countless small acts of, uh, uh, of bravery. And, uh, um, there, there's a ton mutek a famous telemetric saying how it's in the can that be slim that, uh, the land is only, um, one, uh, through hardship. And these are little tiny hardships that, you know, some, some, some something scared you, something feels field feels uncomfortable, but you're going to do the right thing anyway. It's good. It's good to live that way. It's good to live, not afraid.

Speaker 2:          00:09:39       Well said. All right, so let's talk about nationalism because as I said, if you just say the word nationalism or if you say I'm a national list or anything like that, the connotations or the implications are that you're somehow racist. You're Zena phobic, all of these things. So first off, can you just define at least in your view what nationalism is?

Speaker 1:          00:09:57       Sure. Um, I, I actually, I, I grew up in a nationalist house, you know, meaning like, like many Israelis doing, it's not just Israelis, um, people in India, people in Ireland. There's a lot of countries in the world where, where people still remember that a national movement is, uh, is, uh, a struggle against empire. And so it's a struggle for freedom and it still has good connotations. Um, so in, in those kinds of traditions, uh, which I draw on in, in, in my book, nationalism is understood to be a, uh, uh, a principled stand point that sees the world is governed best, uh, when it consists of many independent nations. So each nation will have its own laws, its own traditions, it's own, uh, language and religious, uh, customs and will live independently without being forced to live a certain way, uh, by, by, by, by other nations. Mine, right? And this is,

Speaker 2:          00:10:58       this is basically how we've viewed the world for the last hundred years or so, right? I mean, most relatively sane people that there are countries and they have borders,

Speaker 1:          00:11:06       they're different units. They can negotiate together, right? But, but, but, but it's not, uh, um, it's this way of viewing the world is about three or 400 years old in its current version. In the book, I actually argued that, uh, that, that this is a biblical ideal, right? You, you don't find the Greeks or the Romans, uh, painting a picture of a world of independent nations that that vision of a world of independent nations is a, is something that inherits a, I'm sorry, that that enters our inheritance, uh, from, uh, from Hebrew Bible. And then it appears throughout, you know, throughout Western history in various forms in, uh, in, in various parts of Christian Christian history. So in its current form that the feeling of a just world of free world is one of competition among independent peoples. Um, it, it's about, depending on how you count, it's about three or 400 years old.

Speaker 1:          00:12:05       The first, the first country in Europe to, to, um, to explicitly declare independence is, uh, is, uh, England and 1534, um, uh, Henry and read the eighth says, we're not even formally going to be part of the holy Roman empire anymore. We're just, we're just independent. We're doing our own thing. And that, that model was picked up by, uh, by the Dutch, by the Scots, by the Swiss, by the French, by various others. And, uh, and then becomes kind of the basis for a, uh, an ordering of the world where, where this became more and more the intuition. Of course there were plenty of plenty of empires during those times in lots of injustice. And, and I, I don't want to turn it into like some kind of, you know, utopia or something wasn't, but slowly the, the idea that there's something good about allowing nations to, to, to, to go their own way and to be free, that that did become the common, a common sense view and still was up until up until World War II.

Speaker 1:          00:13:07       I think it was really only in the 1960s that, um, that academics and intellectuals really turned against, against this idea and began arguing that nationalism is just, you know, is just an evil. Right. So what shifted then in the 1960s? Because when you talk about nations with borders that can decide what they do within their borders and that people can have a nationalism that they can be proud of that is in xenophobic or racist or the resident, I think that makes sense to most people. Right. I, it is, you said common sense, it strikes me as common sense. So what happened in the 60s was that sort of a latent period after World War II, that these ideas bubble up through academia. It's, it's all about the trauma of World War One and World War II. It, it's all about that. And um, the, uh, beginning immediately after World War II, um, there were, uh, Marxists and there were liberals who said, ah, look, Hitler's a nationalist.

Speaker 1:          00:14:06       And it's true that Hitler called himself a nationalist. I mean, it gets, are called himself a nationalist, but he's actually an imperialist because from the very beginning, his goal was not for Germany to, you know, to, to be independent. His goal was for Germany to become, as he said, uh, Lord of the Earth, mistress of the globe. So Hitler's not, not, you know, our traditional idea of a national piece, understanding of rationalism right there. Right. Because if he had been, uh, if just if you had been a nationalist by the strict definition that he wouldn't have wanted to do anything outside. Right. So, so he would have been terrible for Germany, but not necessarily a s, uh, starting, uh, world war with France and England and Russia and everybody else. It would have been terrible for Germany anyway, but, but you can't call him a nationalist.

Speaker 1:          00:14:57       According to my tradition, if his dreams aspiration is not the freedom of his people, his dream, you know, among other peoples, his aspiration is to, is to rule the globe. Right? Was expanding. Okay. So, uh, so imperialism versus nationalism, that's for people who are nationalists instead of critics of national for people, our nationals. That's the big divide. Um, is, are you looking, are you willing to give the respect of self determination to many nations like your own, um, or, or are, are, are, are you really just looking to conquer the world? So after World War II, um, various, uh, uh, anti nationalist theories that hadn't succeeded in getting traction up until then got a huge boost from the fact that, that Hitler was a national socialist. And, and that when he spoke about imperialism, use the word nationalism and, um, and um, the, the academic intellectual culture, let's say it was still still producing defense of, of nationalism against imperialism still through the 1950s.

Speaker 1:          00:16:11       But by the time you get to the 1960s, you get, um, Ellie Kaduri is, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, a famous pro imperialists scholar who, um, uh, wrote a book called nationalism, which is kind of an anti nationalist manifesto that, um, blames nationalism for both World Wars and a and says it's on, it's unworkable for all of the arguments that, that are familiar to people today are already in Kaduri. He's a work that, uh, that the divisions among peoples, by creating independent states, you create borders, borders are, are, are, uh, always something people argue about. That itself produces wars and triggers wars and, and, and then the, uh, the thinking that your country is great, right, and making your nation great again, that kind of stuff that, it, uh, the argument is that that kind of nationalism necessarily produces hatred and, uh, hatred, violence, war intolerance. It kind of takes all of the, you know, the worst things of, of, of recent centuries in the past.

Speaker 1:          00:17:19       And pins it on, on this, this one word in this one idea. So if that's not the case, how did these ideas than pick up, is this just sort of where we see this now in academia where they just sort of pick ideas that they sort of all agree on are true and then it just runs throughout, uh, the universities and then eventually trickle down in the media and then get, gets broadcast. The universities are, um, are a hot house for the development of ideas is, you know, in principle is a really, really wonderful to be good, right? In principle, it's a really wonderful thing, but, uh, but because, uh, academia is overwhelmingly, I mean, you know, consists of, um, uh, uh, a debate between kind of Neo Marxists, uh, who, who wanna you know, who, who, whose aim is to achieve justice by undermining pretty much all inherited ideas one after another.

Speaker 1:          00:18:18       So there's that. And then there's, there's the great majority of academics who are, uh, who are liberals and, and don't necessarily agree with the neo Marxism, but it turns out that they're not very good at, uh, at, uh, at, at, at resisting it. So academia ends up being a, um, um, a fight between two universalist visions and they're both utopian. One is, is a neo Marxist Universal's vision, which is utopian. And the other is the liberal universalists division, which is Utopian and ideas that are like nationalism. Um, was there a particular artist that are arguing for, uh, the, the, the goodness of the justice of, of defending your own people looking out for their interests, their tradition, their culture, that kind of thing violates the universalism of both the Marxists and the liberals. Right. So have we watched sort of the failure of liberalism here?

Speaker 1:          00:19:18       So if the Neo Marxists and the postmodern, it's even if they're a smaller percentage at the universities, then the liberals that the liberal somehow, this is what I've been trying to noodle through for the last couple of years ago, that the liberals, somehow you didn't have enough to stand on to, to stop the bad ideas of the neo Marxist. Yeah, exactly. You and you and you can, you can actually see why because, because, um, uh, the, the Neo Marxists have, have a, I mean, the, the, the, the agenda evolves and it develops, but, but it's always, um, a, you know, a very clear, uh, picking out, picking out of ideas that need to be destroyed and uprooted picking out of, you know, institutions that need to be destroyed and uprooted. They're, they're constantly saying, to get justice, then we need to overthrow this, that, and the other thing. And the liberals, they're responses.

Speaker 1:          00:20:08       Uh, no. Everybody just should be free to do whatever they want. And, you know, of course, I'm very sympathetic to that, but, but what you say, it's not enough. It's not enough. When that's the contest. One side is saying, here's a really clear agenda for, for what we gotta do in order to, to, to, to fix the problems in the world. And the, the liberals are always some one form or another of saying, well, no, let's just everybody, like everybody should do whatever they want and that, that's not good enough. If you, if you're fighting a strong vision of, you know, what would be right, you need an, you need to counter it with a strong vision or you lose. And that's what happened. I mean, that's what I'm seeing right now with the liberals in the United States. It's like

Speaker 2:          00:20:48       this, this ever, uh, dissipating group of people that are sort of standing on quicksand because the left, the neo Marxists have sort of taken over the Democratic Party in all of the apparatus of the left. And then you have liberals who now mostly secretly agree with conservatives in a lot of ways, right? But they can't, but they're afraid to say that. And then there we're just watching them whittle away. It's, it's, it's sad to me in, in many ways for the, for the ideas that I care most about.

Speaker 1:          00:21:15       Well, we don't know how it's going. I don't, don't get too sad. You know, we're really bad at predicting what's gonna, what's gonna happen. People are just bad at it. So, um, we got to figure out what's worth fighting for and we may win, we may lose. But, you know, it's, um, um, it's a mistake to think that we know how it's all gonna turn out. We, we, we just don't right now. Nobody, well, if we knew I wouldn't be doing this, so I, nobody predicted the, the, the, the collapse of the Soviet Union or almost nobody and nobody predicted the, the, the, the rise of, of Brexit and Trump and nationalism now where the, that the housing bubble, we're just, we're terrible at, at seeing the future. What we gotta do is we've, we've got to think strategically about, um, what kinds of ideas that are out there and what's needed and we need to work to build up, um, uh, an alternative framework that's going to be more conservative and more attractive and, and, and, and, and, and capable of, of, of rallying people, which, which I, I think liberalism is, is less and less capable of doing these days.

Speaker 2:          00:22:19       So, and I've seen you do some Twitter threads on this sort of thought. So I obviously want to talk about Trump and Brexit and how they fit into this conversation.

Speaker 1:          00:22:26       But, so if, if liberalism has a certain, uh, fault here, what are the answers that conservatism has that you would say could stop some of the rise of this new homework and stuff? Conservatism, the word conservatism refers to two different political movements, which are, which are traditional based, their traditionalist. Um, so conservatism is not, it's not a universal theory, so it's not like Marxism or liberalism where you take a Marxist or a liberal and they'll tell you, um, how the whole world should think, you know, in all times. In all ages, every place in the world. Conservatism is not like that because, because, uh, being a traditionalist means, you know, I may, I may respect more or less the traditions of, uh, of, of the Russians or the Chinese or the, the, the Indians or the Germans, but, but all those trades, each, each one of them is different, right?

Speaker 1:          00:23:24       So, uh, so, uh, some of them are like more in some of them, like less in, in the American context or let's say the Anglo American context. To be a conservative means a specific thing. It means to be a, to believe that the Anglo American political traditions, political and religious traditions are a, uh, an extraordinary achievement that they, they are one of the, the, the, the greatest, if not the greatest, one of the greatest traditions, um, that have ever been developed in mankind's history. And that most of, um, what we value in, in what we love about the modern world, uh, whether it's, uh, uh, the, the, the idea of limited government or a individual liberties or, uh, or the, the, the, the kind of science that that grows out of, uh, uh, out of Newton or the kind of culture that grows out of a common sense, skepticism.

Speaker 1:          00:24:30       Um, all of these things there, they're part of the Anglo American, uh, inheritance of a, an empiricist attitude towards knowledge. Uh, a common law tradition tradition, which is not based on, on universal rights, but, but which pioneered a freedom of speech and freedom of, of, uh, of, um, uh, of, uh, of property. In fact, Mo, Mo, most of, of what's in the American bill of rights is these traditional English, uh, English rights, which were not developed by liberals. They were developed by conservatives fighting against, uh, against the authoritarianism of, uh, let's say the stewards. Um, so when we talk about conservatism, we're, we're not talking about, um, there's, uh, one set of ideas that are eternally always true. We're talking about a tradition of a certain nation or a group of nations, which by trial and error, right? So it's empirical, right? By trial and error over over centuries, over thousands of years in fact, have succeeded in, uh, developing and stumbling upon things that are just spectacular and that are kind of a gift to, to the rest of, of mankind.

Speaker 1:          00:25:49       And today what, what we're seeing is that the, the educational institutions, rather than saying, look, let's take a look at the traditions of this nation and, uh, and, uh, you know, the thousands of years of development going all the way back to the Bible, let's see how it contributed to, uh, the things that, that we care about, that that's what a conservative would do. And say what contributed to, to the things we care about and how can we strengthen those strands in the tradition, both nationally and also in our, in, in our personal lives. How can we live as conservative people who will raise children to respect the things that should be respected. That's what conservatives focus on. And so they're playing, conservatives are always playing a completely different game from, from liberals. Liberals are trying to try to tell you some abstracts that have rules that if everybody were to follow them, then everything would be great.

Speaker 1:          00:26:49       And conservatives say there is no such abstracts that have rules that if everybody follows them, everything would be great. What there is is um, nations handing down a way of life which have some good things about them, some bad things about them, but, but everything that's good about them is coming down from that tradition. So we need to be working on strengthening it and, and, and, and, uh, and, and, and improving it. So as we're watching, what I would say is sort of the collapse of liberalism on the left and now there's sort of all of these refugees, many of whom have been in this very studio and who watched the show. There are refugees that I think are moving to something that is center right, which I see is rich with ideas and debate and all of these things. I think a lot of people have some fear.

Speaker 1:          00:27:33       If you've come from the left, they have some fear that there's some sort of religious connotation attached to conservatism. Now you just explained a little bit of the history of that. Um, but do you think there's room for a secular conservatism? Can that, can that fit within their look? If it's a great question and there's no, there's no simple answer to it because, um, uh, let me say one thing that's really simple. You don't have to become a, an Orthodox Christian or an Orthodox Jew in order to take part in, uh, in this great inheritance, which is your inheritance. Okay. That's, so, it's a different question to say, is it actually possible to sanitize it? Of all religious aspects that, that I'm, I'm more doubtful. So let's take taken an example that's really related to this book. Um, uh, I, I mentioned earlier that the, the, um, the idea of national independence is a biblical idea.

Speaker 1:          00:28:38       Um, the Romans didn't believe in national independence. The Greeks didn't believe in national independence. I mean, it has a source and that source is in, uh, in this tradition that says that, you know, the god of Israel, God, God, creator of Heaven and earth is speaking to Moses. And unlike all the other gods of the ancient Middle East, this particular God does not order his people to go out and conquer the four corners of the earth, which is what the gods of the Assyrians and the Babylonians were doing. God event. That's a pretty big sea change from what was happening before that. It's an, it's an incredible, I mean that in a, in at a certain level, that's what, that's what the Hebrew Bible is about. It's, it's about, is there some alternative to, uh, to living these, these little tribes that are constantly, we're each other or bringing peace and prosperity by having, you know, the Babylonians conquered the entire world, the four corners of the earth as they, as they used to say.

Speaker 1:          00:29:36       And uh, and so here, the, the, the God of Israel speaks to Moses and, and even though he's, he's the creator of Heaven and earth, and he's the god of everything. He doesn't, he doesn't, he doesn't tell a brand. He doesn't tell Moses, go, go out and conquer the whole world. He gives them borders the first, as far as we know, the first borders, any God ever gave his people, he says, here are your borders and you're not allowed to cross them. You're not allowed to go trouble. The neighbors because they have, they have their own land and their own promise and their own way. Now, this is, this is a huge revolution in political thought, but, but at the same time also also in theology that that there could be a god that cares about all humanity, but what he wants is his, each different, each different nation to, to, to, to, to have its own freedom.

Speaker 1:          00:30:22       Now take that as an example. That's, that's something that I think it's very difficult to, to have an Anglo American conservatism that uproots that biblical heritage. Okay. Now that that doesn't dictate, you know, what, you know what you believe on every subject just cause you're a conservative. But, but if you don't have some kind of, if you don't have a sense that there's something incredibly important that needs to be honored in hand handed down in that tradition, then it's going to be real hard for you to be in conservative. So how do you make room then? So I get it. So on a, on a macro level, you're saying you need though, that those underpinnings on the micro level for the individual that comes across that maybe that either isn't religious or, or for gay people or anyone that's, that's sort of the outsider, uh, how can they say, all right, well, I can fit into this, this conservative idea in different, different times, different periods of history.

Speaker 3:          00:31:24       Um, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:31:27       there were tighter and looser,

Speaker 3:          00:31:30       mmm. MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:31:32       More inclusive and less inclusive versions of the traditions that we're talking about. This is, I think there's, uh, an important, common, very common misconception about conservatism is that often people are not conservatives assumed that the traditions are monolithic. They dictate one answer on every question. You know, the tradition is this a authoritarian thing? It, it's always been the same. It has, you know, it has a catechism and uh, and you, you just have to believe and do whatever you're told, and if you don't, then then you're out. I think that's a completely, it's almost a propagandistic view of the way traditions actually works. The way traditions actually work is that, that, of course, a strong tradition. Um, does, um, uh, does seek to inculcate norms? When I say, when I say norms, I mean, uh, the thing that it would be best to do where the thing that it would be best to be, but being the fact that the tradition, hands down certain norms.

Speaker 1:          00:32:41       First of all, there's huge arguments within the tradition about what those norms are, right? I mean, the, the traditions themselves are very often very pluralistic internally. And then even if you're not part of that pluralism, there's, there's additional layers. There's the, there's, there's the things that, uh, that are, uh, strongly encouraged and the things they're slightly encouraged and then there's things that are tolerated. And then there, then there are things, things that are, uh, are, are, are considered problematic, but, but you'll leave them alone for now. And then the things that the tradition, you know, goes after and tries to, uh, to say, look, that that's really going to ruin us. Right. Murdering people. It's a bit mind. Right. So, um, so I, I think that the more conservative you become and the more you study what conservatism really is as opposed to, you know, the cartoon version of it that we get in, in, you know, most academic courses on the subject, let's say, or, or, or, or, or on television, when, when, when you study it, of course you'll find things in the past that you know, that, uh, that you'll see as as terrible.

Speaker 1:          00:33:53       Nobody's pretending that's not the case. But a tradition is something that, uh, is always internal, internally pluralistic. Um, it has different levels of space that it makes for different, different kinds of, of, uh, of dissidents and you know, for, for, for example, the, the, the English tradition is, um, it's, it's often accused of being anti-catholic. And, and you'll notice that it's relationship with, uh, with, uh, with Judaism is not the same as its relationship with Catholicism. Why? Because, because the, the periods that we're talking about, our periods in which Catholicism was, uh, uh, was the official ideology of a world empire that was trying to conquer, conquer the English and prevent them from being independent. And I'm not saying everything that was done in the name of, of defending against this what, you know, w w w w w was perfectly well executed, but you'll have to, I think, use some common sense, a nation that's facing a world empire that has a certain religion that is, that, that that's its formal ideology.

Speaker 1:          00:35:04       Well, of course they're not going to treat Catholics the same way that they're going to treat other dissidents. But I think people are always looking to, looking at the past to see, um, uh, oh, Gotcha. Look, they, uh, the persecuted this and that and the other thing and, and, and, and usually it's true, but they're not looking at the way in which, um, in which a dissidence did in fact a flourish increasingly over the millennia UN under these, uh, these different, um, uh, different, different kinds of regimes. I mean, the fact is we, Jews are still here. I mean, has, there was plenty of persecution. There's plenty to complain about. But the fact is that we're still here. And, and, and, and that, that means that there were, uh, times in places throughout the history of Christianity and Islam where, uh, where the Jews had more or less status, more or less tolerance, more or less kind of contribution in, in, in society.

Speaker 1:          00:36:06       Um, and I, so I, I would say that with regard to conservatism today, um, we're in any case in a period where we're, what we're trying to do is we're trying to salvage what we can. All right. I mean, I, I don't, I don't know if it's going to succeed, but, um, as a conservative, the maps that I face is today is virtually every major idea or concept or ideal that was handed down from the past has been savagely attacked and may be overthrown in the last few generations. So I, I'm, I'm talking about the idea of the nation they did with the family. Uh, the, the, uh, the, the ideas of man and woman of God and scripture of a holiness of, of honor. I mean, you can just keep going and going. I mean, anything that, that, that I think created the things that are good in our world today that really worked is now being savaged and, and destroyed.

Speaker 1:          00:37:15       And I'm, you know, I'm, I'm, I'm looking for allies. I'm not looking, looking for, for enemies. I hear I have enough. I mean the people who are, uh, and, and, and it's, it's many the ones who are actively, purposely destroying these things and the ones who were just going along with them. I mean, that's most of our culture. So, um, you know, I, I, I would, I would be real grateful for, uh, a willingness to have conversation with anybody who's willing to, uh, to try to, uh, to, to work out a contemporary conservatism that could do some good and that would be as inclusive as possible.

Speaker 2:          00:37:53       All right then, so let's take this conversation into the modern world. There's a couple things happening right now that sort of fit, we'll let you talk about in the book, but that, that fit perfectly for this conversation. So let's talk about Trump. First. People described him as a nationalist. He talks about America first, as far as I can tell, he doesn't want to nation build all over the world and, and expand American empire everywhere. Um, um,

Speaker 1:          00:38:17       that's sorta your kind of nationalism, right? Yeah, it is. I, I, I, I think on nationalism, Trump, Trump is, is excellent. I mean, he's, he's not just, um, he's not just looking for ways, you know, and this is, you know, whether you think that he's finding right ways are proposing the right ways is his, the, his theme is, is looking for ways to try to, uh, to think about America's a nation rather as, rather than as a world empire. We need to come back to that in a second, but with, um, but then he goes and he speaks in front of the United Nations, right? And he says, look, I'm not just saying, um, that my job is America first. I'm talking to all the nations. I'm saying, look, each of you, you're elected by a certain public or you represent a certain public and, and your job is to take care of those people.

Speaker 1:          00:39:13       And I think that's, that's exactly the kind of, uh, of, of, of nationalism we should be thinking. Does that right there show you how crazy things have gotten at the academic level? Because even when he says that, that we should just think about ourselves first that somehow is thought of as Zena phobic or, or racist or something like that. And it really, anyone, if you really sat in it and thought about it for a second or maybe if you, if you remove Trump's personality or whatever it is, but have you thought about just what he's saying that Americans should care about America first and what happens with our board first? It it sensible. I mean, as you said at the beginning, it's common sense of the people in the United States are convinced that they have some kind of a uniquely crazy thing going on because of who Trump is.

Speaker 1:          00:40:02       I actually, I think this is actually just not true. I mean if you go just just go look at the UK, right? They don't have Donald Trump. You think that things are any less crazy in the UK than they are? And we'll get to exit in a minute. But it's, Gee, look at a sister democracy within a lot of ways, a very, uh, a very similar culture. And the, uh, the, the elites I'm talking about the universities, the media, um, the, uh, um, a lot of the, the, the, the, the career politicians and bureaucrats, there's this layer of people who are, are, they're just as crazy against, uh, any kind of indications of, uh, of nationalism and national independence in the UK as, as they are in America. So it's not, Trump didn't cause this craziness. Trump is, is, is actually more of an effect than he is a cause.

Speaker 1:          00:41:01       The craziness predates him. The craziness begins with, I mean, it has a long history, but let's say roughly the craziness begins roughly in 1989 when the, um, when the Soviet Union falls, the Berlin Wall falls and America, which had, had spent, most of it's not, not all, but most of it's, um, uh, two centuries of independence arguing for the virtue of independent nations. Right. Being mostly on that side of things, right? When the, when, when, when the, when the, the Americans were broadcasting their radio broadcasts into Europe during World War II, what were they, what were they broadcast and they're broadcasting, you've been conquered by the evil empire and we're coming to free the nations of Europe so that then they will be able to live independently. That was like, we're not coming to make our little satellite, right? Well, we're not coming to be, you know, a better empire to conquer you and rule you.

Speaker 1:          00:42:01       Right? So, so at the time it was clear and I think most, most, most probably don't realize how incredibly unique that is, right? That a country would go halfway across the world to do that. Right? It's a, it's a, it's a very special thing. You know, and we can, we can talk about, but this, this goes back to your religion point. When FDR on the eve of World War II, right? These FDR gives his, uh, uh, in, in January of 1939, he has a state of the Union address where he can already see that America is going to go to war against, uh, against the fascists and maybe the communist too. And, and, and he describes what it is that we're, what is it we Americans are fighting for? What are we going to be fighting for? And he says, first of all, for our religion and then from our religion comes our democracy and our willingness to have comedy among nations.

Speaker 1:          00:42:52       But he says, first and foremost, religion effect. He calls the allied nations, he calls them the God fearing democracies, right? T today nobody would say their e t t no. Nobody would understand that FDR and the people then thought they were fighting for God fearing countries against atheist or totalitarians. Nobody thinks like that anymore. But, but, but that's what it was. All right, so, so if we go back to, um, uh, where does this willingness to allow other nations, their freedom come from? FDR At least knows that it comes, that it comes from, from Christianity that comes from Judaism. And Christianity, but to go back to, to, to uh, to the, the, the current crisis. We've got elites that, uh, after 1989, and it doesn't matter if they call themselves liberal or conservative. I mean almost all of them, Democrats, Republicans, Labor, conservative in the UK and all, almost all the parties in Europe went after this utopian dream of one law to cover the entire earth.

Speaker 1:          00:43:59       Uh, uh, George Hw Bush called it the new world order. Like if you're a nationalist, you, you hear this kind of thing, it just sends a chill down your spine, right? The Bells go off. Go off. What that, that's why the American one, the Cold War was to, was to impose order on the entire planet. And now America's going to decide, I mean that, that was really kind of a cookie moment. And not only that, but, but bushes that one world ordered order speech. I mean he had a few of them, but, but the particular one world order speech and he says explicitly for a generations, mankind has been struggling to reach this moment. It's like this utopian thing. A thousand generations. We've been struggling to reach this moment, but, but, but all the previous generations have failed in. Now we're going to succeed. What are we going to succeeded?

Speaker 1:          00:44:44       He says, we're going to eliminate the, the law of the jungle and replace it by the rule of law. Right. It, I mean it's, it's like this, you know, John Lennon, stuff like the, the, the, the, the entire planet is going to be this borderless thing under a single, under a single law, somehow automatically love each other and, right. We all more with each other and we're gonna have, because the whole comedy, because the whole past was, you know, based on ignorance and darkness and inclusion that, you know, there was nothing good back there. And I mean, he didn't explicitly say that, but that, that's the clear implication. But it's funny that it's a very deal Marxist idea coming out. H It's Georgia. Absolutely. Absolutely. Nobody would really think it absolutely is. But that's, I mean, if you're, sometimes you hear conservatives like me say it, it's all just liberalism, right?

Speaker 1:          00:45:32       You know, it doesn't, it doesn't matter what label they put on it because, because the, the fact is that, that all the elites at the top of all of these academic institutions and, and, and, uh, political parties, they had all these disagreements among one another, but, right. They disagree. They thought that they had election campaigns, but they, but, but they weren't disagreeing about the fundamentals. The fundamental was we liberals in the west, we know how to run the world. We've got the answer. Like, all you need to do is, you know, take, take the way America runs and, or, or, or, or Germany or whatever you want, and uh, and apply it to every country in the world to every nation in the world. But if necessary, by force will dictate the rules. There's going to rules for the whole planet. And if somebody does something wrong, then we start bombing them.

Speaker 1:          00:46:25       Which, I mean, that's, it's simplistic, but that's roughly a description of an entire generation of American and, and, uh, and, and, and, and European political thoughts. It'd be like the neo conservatives basically, right? Well, they're, they're just one strand. I mean, you'll, you'll, you'll, you'll notice that the, the, the, the neoconservatives, uh, may may have been arguing right for let's say invade, invade Iraq and Afghanistan, whereas Liberals in Europe might've been saying, no, don't invade Iraq and Afghanistan. So there, there's substantive disagreements, but what they're not disagreeing about is that the European ideal of eliminate all the borders, right? A, uh, a, uh, the, the, the, the European Union, uh, founded in 1992 in, in, in, in its current form, any right after the Berlin Wall fell the idea, we're going to take down all the borders. We're not gonna have restrictions on immigration or the free or, or, or, or, or trade or, or, or, or anything that we, every, everybody's going to be free to be part of one thing.

Speaker 1:          00:47:33       And Europe itself, you know, has no borders, right? You're, you're, you're, you're didn't know and still doesn't know to this day how many countries on earth it's going to expand to embrace and its entire project. The of the European elites is creating a world's courts and, uh, and world economic bodies to regulate everything on earth and get everybody on one page doing, doing, doing one thing. So, so there's an argument between the Europeans and the Americans. Should the Americans be invading your act? But there's no argument about what the project is. There's no argument about the idea that we don't actually need diversity among nations. We, we don't need an independent nations. We need one central thing that's going to govern everything. So is the simplest way to encapsulate their argument is that's like the, I get the d there's this dystopian idea or sort of that by freeing everybody or something that, you know, we'll just ignore thousands of years of history and we're all going to love each other, something like that.

Speaker 1:          00:48:32       But with the more, um, the ferry version of this is that, well, one world government now you can absolutely control everybody. I mean, would you say that's really the heart of this? It's really about control. It's freeing everybody, right? You're exactly right. It's, well, they say they're freeing everybody. But their idea of freedom is, is, uh, you know, let me take just a small example from, you know, from being an Orthodox Jew. I think this applies to everybody, but, uh, but, um, uh, they have an idea of what human rights is and they, they're sure that their idea of human rights is true for everybody on earth. Nevermind the fact that, you know, every five or 10 years, the content of it actually moves, right? Right. But at any given moment, right this way, but at any given moment, they think that they know, you know what, you know, what the absolute, you know, what reason was a capital r what it dictates is that the true setup for rights for everybody on earth.

Speaker 1:          00:49:31       So, um, so as an Orthodox Jew, um, I, I immediately run into problems with this. Why? Because, because, uh, we, we have a tradition going back thousands of years of, of, uh, of Surrey circumcising our, our, our, our male children. And, and it's, it's, it's a, a, a central symbol of, um, of, uh, both the, uh, of the hardship of joining the Jewish people and, uh, and, and going into covenant with God. That's our tradition. You don't have to like it or not like it. That's the way we do thing. We can do things. It's incredibly important to us now. Now the, the, the universal reason people, they come and say, well, look, you're biting, violating the rights of the child. And so you're not allowed to do that anymore. We're, we're, we're, we're going to ban it. Or, um, we have a, a, a method of, of, uh, slaughtering animals, uh, four for food that goes back thousands of years.

Speaker 1:          00:50:29       Koch, kosher slaughter. And, uh, from our traditional understanding, this is a, this is humanitarian, right? The, the, the, the, the Jewish kosher slaughter. It, it's aim is to eliminate, among other things, to, to eliminate things like, uh, uh, hunting and tearing animals apart and doing all sorts of other horrible things. No, there's only certain animals you're allowed to slaughter and you have to slaughter to them in a certain way, which, which traditionally we thought that's the most painless way. But now the, the uh, the, the universal human rights people are in this case, the universal Vercel rights. People that come and say, no, you can't slaughter your away because we know the answer of, of, you know, of the best way to slaughter an animal. And so you're going to do it our way. I mean, basically what they're saying is, is you're not allowed to be a Jew.

Speaker 1:          00:51:21       You're not allowed to be a traditional Jew because we figured out the answers. We figured out the answers for everybody. And if you want to do it due to, to do your traditions, then that will shut you down. Now, that same argument is true that I just gave Forrest at ox Judaism. It's true for everybody. It's true for every tradition. There is no such thing as, as some professors in Germany sit and figure out the universal human rights for all time and, and then we impose it on everybody without oppressing all the other people have their own traditions of how to do so. Interesting to me because as you know, I came from the left and I wasn't progressive and I saw this and then when I started waking up to it, that's sort of when people started caring about what I was thinking. But I remember thinking that even when the gay rights movement was happening in America, but there was this very odd thing that if you didn't get to exactly where they were on gay rights or gay marriage that day, they got there that you were automatically a big, and it's like what a crazy way of viewing the world because Barack Obama, who nobody in their right mind would think is anti gay.

Speaker 1:          00:52:19       He ran against gay marriage. She was not for gay marriage the first time you went around. So history, if these people win, the long game history will be not too kind to Barack Obama. And I guess we're going to have to take down his library, which is being constructed right now. I think they're gonna have to take that down because he was against the human rights that are going to be very obvious to them that this is a 20, 30 years. This is, this is such an important point. I mean, the, the, the only way that you can keep the, the only way that you can preserve

Speaker 3:          00:52:51       mmm.

Speaker 1:          00:52:52       A certain way of doing things or a certain idea is through

Speaker 3:          00:52:57       mmm.

Speaker 1:          00:52:59       Just through traditions that pass down and attitude of sacredness and giving honor to, to that way of doing things. And you know, of course nothing human is permanent. Everything changes a little bit from generation to generation. But, um, but we see in, you know, by looking at [inaudible], looking at the, the, the Jews or in India or, or, uh, or, or in China, we can see, we see that are some things that can actually be a handed down over thousands of years. It, it's possible, but this idea that our reason is just going to figure out the right thing and nevermind the past. That's just all that's doing is creating a permanent revolution where every single generation, I mean, even every 10 years, it already devours and reject and destroys the thing that it created in just a few moments ago. [inaudible] all right. So there, there are some people who, you know, who, who, um, who in theory, they find that attractive.

Speaker 1:          00:54:06       They, I mean, they're, uh, the young people usually, right? Find that very attractive, like everything before us was awful. You know, it, it's, it's part of being apparently part of being human is that a lot of adolescents, um, feel during their adolescence that really nothing is important other than the fact that I'm free and I decided to do what I want. Um, and, uh, you know, it's not true of all adolescents, but it's true of a lot of adolescents. It's a very, very common thing. And, and, and, and it's part of being human. But, um, but when, when you're a grown up, um, you have to, uh, take responsibility for questions like, um, is, is my nation, is my religion? Are My traditions actually good? If I believe that they're good, if I believe they're contributing good to the world, then there are things I need to do in order to hand them down.

Speaker 1:          00:55:03       It's not a few things. It's a lot of things. Human beings, if they're not, if, if, if they don't work really hard to uh, maintain the, the, the honoring of the traditions, the traditions get thrown out of the window and you're going to have nothing left. Now I'm like, let's take something like, um, free speech because I know you talk about it a lot and free speech is people think about free speech as though, I mean it's the standard thing to say is it's a right, it's a human right. It's in the constitution, it's a unit, but people rarely way too rarely focus on the fact that the actual implementation of a regime of free speech is a tradition. It's a tradition. If, if you need to work hard to raise your children to not tell the other one to shut up, but you need to train them over years, it makes you angry that your brother is saying that, that your sister saying that.

Speaker 1:          00:56:05       Makes you angry. I mean, th th they're constantly ready to go to war over, right? That's the way kids are and you have to train them and work on them and work on them to civilize them, allows the other one to speak. I know that it's making you angry, but allow them to speak. Let them talk. Then you'll get your turn. Now that that little family Vignette, it's actually true of the, of, of the entire civilization. The fact that that you can have a, you know, a country, most people are willing to allow someone else to say what they think even though they disagree. That's an incredibly difficult tradition to inculcate to, to raise people to do that. That's a fight that you have to refight in, in, in, in the education of the entire country and every generation it's you, there's no point in asserting it cause it's reasonable.

Speaker 1:          00:56:56       It's not about whether it's reasonable, it's about what do, what are you willing to do to make these traditions channel people in such a way that guess what, they're not free. Someone says something you don't like, then you're not free to just start, start cursing them out like people do on Twitter. You're not free to do that because self restraint, self constraint is the only way that freedom of speech is going to exist in your country. That means that we need to focus on, on the constraint part on how do you get people to not do whatever they want. That's the only way that free speech can continue to exist. So the, even even the things that seem to be like the most valuable freedoms are, they exist because they are Anglo American traditions. And if you're running a revolution where you're overthrowing one tradition after another, after another, nothing is going to be left of the things that we value, including the freedoms.

Speaker 1:          00:57:53       So all right, so that being said, and that that could have been the ending right there, cause that's how your kappa show, right? But if everything you said is true right there, then how concerned are you for the future? Because it does seem that the forces that you're fighting against in this book are getting stronger. Yeah, it's it, it's very frightening. It, Eh, on the free speech thing, you know, a, a generation ago I was at university and, um, I, uh, I started the, uh, the, the Princeton Tory, it's the, it was the, the, the pro Reagan publication on, on the university campus. And, um, of course, lots of people didn't like it. Conservatives where I minority, um, and people call me names, people that, you know, there's all sorts of nastiness, but nobody ever thought it was illegitimate. Right. It's a different era. I mean, w w we had friends who are liberals and we'd friends who were progressive, nobody thought that our publication that are pro Reagan, that are conservative publication, that it was illegitimate.

Speaker 1:          00:59:01       Right. They didn't think, no, you're not allowed to say that. This is where someone like Ben Shapiro, who often is just saying the things that Reagan said that were brought over and jet and tears. And today people are, there's lots of things. So in those days, I would just say whatever I, you know, whatever, I thought I would write whatever I wanted. I, that's how I grew up. But I, I tell my children, you know, and I'm ashamed of this, but, but it's true. I tell my children, no, look, there's things you believe that you're, you're not allowed to say anymore. And I wish it weren't like that. I, I'd like to see it change. But right now there's no point in like in, in, you know, throwing away your, your, uh, your, your capacity to earn a living and to do good on all sorts of fronts because you insist in just saying whatever you want to say.

Speaker 1:          00:59:48       I can't stand it. But that's, that's the reality is that, is that the, uh, um, the zone for, for, for freedom of speech is rapidly, rapidly closing. It's getting narrower and narrower. And, um, and, and that's just one example of the things that we've lost. I think it's a very, it's a very frightening period. But let me just say one positive thing because I mean, look, I can easily plot a trajectory where, um, where, uh, where America doesn't make it through this, but w w w, w w let me look at the other possibility. This is also a moment of great opportunity because it's, there's a tradition among diplomats that you read sometimes in, um, in history books that kind of a legend that the world, uh, is like, uh, an ice cap. The political world is like an ice cap and every, every once in awhile it, it unfreezes and it breaks up and it rearranges itself.

Speaker 1:          01:00:55       So like every 50 years or every 75 or 100 years. And we really do seem to be in a period like that where, where all the bets really are off and, um, that will hopefully draw to the front, um, creative, strong, uh, people who have, um, well if something important to offer to the rephrasing the re, uh, re construction of, um, of the world that's coming, um, this reconstruction, you know, it, it, it can be something absolutely horrendous and I don't, we shouldn't kid ourselves, we're really moving in a bad direction. But, um, the reason that I find, uh, the nationalist movements encouraging in, in American the UK and other countries is not because it's not because, you know, I support everything that every one of these people say or do. I actually have absolutely no idea what most of them, you know, are going to do.

Speaker 1:          01:02:02       And a lot of them are new to politics and we don't actually know what they're going to do, but, but what I, uh, but I do see the opportunity. I D I don't know if it's going to turn out well, but I do see clearly the opportunity when, um, when, right. Because the national movements movements could take a turn for the worst, right? They could turn to things that are about race. They have no nationalism and those types of things. They certainly could. And, and, uh, and that is actually one of the things that, that, uh, that I say when I, when I go around giving talks is I, I've noticed that many conservatives, um, dismiss the, the racist, right? I mean, they have a, um, a lot of conservatives, they look, they're looking at, you know, how strong is the Nazi party or the KKK and, and, and, and they are, they're trivial.

Speaker 1:          01:02:57       I mean, they're, they're absolutely trivial and it's completely unfair to associate conservatism with that answer. It's reasonable in the sense that they dismiss it. But, uh, but looking at the level of, at the level of ideas of who's, who's thinking, who's trying to actually come up with a worldview that could a few years from now become some, something important, I think it's a mistake to, to dismiss the far right. Not that I'm not that I'm sympathetic to them, but the, the quality of the, uh, of the, the arguments, the, the work that's being done by people to justify a kind of a neo Darwinian kind of racism, like a white, a white identity politics. They're actually doing quite a bit of work to get this idea into shape now. I, I detest it, right? Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. I hope it's soundly defeated, but it's really quite a attractive to, uh, lots of people in their twenties and their thirties who are looking at, you know, the, the old liberal order and saying, oh my gosh, well that doesn't work.

Speaker 1:          01:04:07       So, so where do we go? Um, and it means that, um, yeah, we have those of us who are, uh, inclined to a national conservatism that is, uh, that has nothing to do with race. That, that, you know, those of us who think the color of your skin really should make absolutely zero difference in the way that we order society. There's so many important important issues. Why the color of your skin. So those of us who, who are, uh, um, inclined to a national conservatism, uh, which will, uh, believe in, in the nation and its heritage, but I have no interest in, in, you know, in, in the genetic population that you know, that you supposedly came from, we have a lot of work to do to create something that's going to be sufficiently powerful. I'm talking about an idea that sufficiently coherent and powerful and attractive so that it will actually have, uh, be able to be politically effective w before these other guys, like the forces before these other guys, you know, before they win.

Speaker 1:          01:05:13       I mean, right now they're not winning, but 10 years from now, 20 years from, I would, I think all bets are off. We don't know where this is going. And so, so there is there dangerous, but there's an opportunity to create a, uh, a much more traditionalist, conservative, um, uh, uh, a decent, moderate common sense traditionalist conservatism, which will be national, which will be nationalists, which we'll, we'll, we'll believe in the traditions of nations and, and, and seek to maintain their independence. There's a space to do that and it's exciting to be able to do that because that space hasn't existed. You know, for the last generation. It was, you know, no one wanted to hear it. It's, that's a conservative space that a good old fashion liberal could, could be okay with. You know, we've barely scratched the surface here, but we got a rapper now, so we should, we should definitely do this again. Okay. I'd love to. Can I get you back here to the United States and hear this again? It in Israel. We'll do it intrusive. I'll do either way. I'll buy, I'll buy you a steak next to the old city walls. If you come to Jerusalem, done. I'm done. All right. For more on your arm and follow him on Twitter. Why has one.
