00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:01.649
David is right.

00:00:01.649 --> 00:00:03.215
The tester could, in fact,

00:00:03.215 --> 00:00:08.020
test and dismiss the state using the
kind of rule David was talking about.

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:11.310
But, David, do you think there is
another way that this could be done?

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:14.593
&gt;&gt; So, I guess, actually,
the generator could do it as well.

00:00:14.593 --> 00:00:19.309
So, in this case, we could also have
the generator say, I don't need to ever

00:00:19.309 --> 00:00:24.460
generate a state that involves sending
one person over to an empty coast.

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.581
That's always going to result in a state
that the tester would have thrown out.

00:00:27.581 --> 00:00:30.432
And it's not going to result in any
states that the tester wouldn't have

00:00:30.432 --> 00:00:30.971
thrown out.

00:00:30.971 --> 00:00:32.549
So, generator could do it, too.

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:34.327
&gt;&gt; That sounds like a good answer to me.

00:00:34.327 --> 00:00:38.146
So once again, we are back to the issue
of where do we draw the balance

00:00:38.146 --> 00:00:41.431
of responsibility between
the generator and the tester?

00:00:41.431 --> 00:00:45.510
The important thing to note from here,
however, is that generate and test,

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.021
when endowed with the right
kind of knowledge,

00:00:48.021 --> 00:00:49.680
can be a very powerful method.
