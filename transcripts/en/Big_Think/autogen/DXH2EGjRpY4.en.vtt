thing about these random strategies is

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450
thing about these random strategies is
 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.749
thing about these random strategies is
that they ensure that your opponent can

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759
that they ensure that your opponent can
 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.030

how do you figure out how to be random

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670
how do you figure out how to be random
 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.060

have figured out is that in zero-sum

you're against a sophisticated opponent

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860
you're against a sophisticated opponent

is to adopt the strategy which minimizes

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180
is to adopt the strategy which minimizes
 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.200
is to adopt the strategy which minimizes
your maximum loss this is sometimes

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210
your maximum loss this is sometimes
 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.469
your maximum loss this is sometimes
called the minimax strategy so the idea

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479
called the minimax strategy so the idea
 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.030
called the minimax strategy so the idea
is you think what's the worst-case

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040
is you think what's the worst-case
 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.969
is you think what's the worst-case
scenario for me what could my opponent

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979
scenario for me what could my opponent
 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.340
scenario for me what could my opponent
do that would make me worse off and then

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350
do that would make me worse off and then
 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.380
do that would make me worse off and then
you figure out what's the best strategy

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390
you figure out what's the best strategy
 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.440
you figure out what's the best strategy
against that so you're minimizing your

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450
against that so you're minimizing your
 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.319
against that so you're minimizing your
maximum loss game theorists prove that

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:09.329
maximum loss game theorists prove that
 

00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:11.199
maximum loss game theorists prove that
if you use this way of thinking

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209
if you use this way of thinking
 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:14.449
if you use this way of thinking
minimizing your maximum loss you ensure

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459
minimizing your maximum loss you ensure
 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:15.210
minimizing your maximum loss you ensure
that

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220
that
 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.070

as you've guarded against the worst case
 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.600

scenario and not only that but in

zero-sum games you've done the best you

zero-sum games you've done the best you
 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.850
zero-sum games you've done the best you
can possibly do that's not true in games

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860
can possibly do that's not true in games
 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.800
can possibly do that's not true in games
that aren't zero-sum so one has to be

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810
that aren't zero-sum so one has to be
 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.390
that aren't zero-sum so one has to be
very careful about employing this

very careful about employing this

you're not in a zero-sum interaction you
