00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.750
Imagine that you've just been hired as

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:05.440
director of clinical operations at a brand new

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:09.430
company in Silicon Valley. A promising new drug

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:11.330
has been shown to be very effective at

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:14.670
reducing the risk of prostate cancer in mice.

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.760
But preclinical animal studies also showed that some

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.900
mice had a mutation in a gene that

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.410
caused adverse side effects. Now, the mice that

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.010
didn't have this particular mutation, didn't have the

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.770
side effects either. Now you're going to begin to design

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.220
your clinical trial to test this in humans

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.220
and you discover that this gene is conserved from

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.278
mice to humans and that's like 90% identitcal.

00:00:42.278 --> 00:00:45.560
And about 3% of humans have the same mutation

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.680
that caused the really adverse side effects in

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.470
mice. So which of the following do you think

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:53.380
would be the most ethical decision to design your

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:56.250
clinical trial, and why? Would you include those humans with

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.130
the adverse side effect mutation to have a more scientific

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:02.870
conclusion? Or since you can identify them using their genetic

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.570
information would you not include those individuals with the

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.050
adverse side effect mutation so that. They don't have to

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:10.790
suffer the consequences. I want you to pick one of

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.370
these answers and tell me why in the box here.
