we evolved as human beings a few million

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:03.179
we evolved as human beings a few million
 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:05.570
we evolved as human beings a few million
years ago on the Savannah in Africa and

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580
years ago on the Savannah in Africa and
 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.450
years ago on the Savannah in Africa and
we evolved to escape tigers or Lions or

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460
we evolved to escape tigers or Lions or
 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.299
we evolved to escape tigers or Lions or
predators and so what makes common sense

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309
predators and so what makes common sense
 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.900
predators and so what makes common sense
to us is the world on our scale you know

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910
to us is the world on our scale you know
 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.939
to us is the world on our scale you know
how to throw a rock or a spear or how to

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949
how to throw a rock or a spear or how to
 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.599
how to throw a rock or a spear or how to
find a cave and and and we didn't evolve

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609
find a cave and and and we didn't evolve
 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.349
find a cave and and and we didn't evolve
to understand quantum mechanics and

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:23.359
to understand quantum mechanics and
 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:26.029
to understand quantum mechanics and
therefore it's not too surprising that

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039
therefore it's not too surprising that
 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.490
therefore it's not too surprising that
on scales vastly different than the kind

on scales vastly different than the kind
 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.980
on scales vastly different than the kind
of experience we had as we were evolving

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990
of experience we had as we were evolving
 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.040
of experience we had as we were evolving
as a species that nature seems strange

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050
as a species that nature seems strange
 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.560
as a species that nature seems strange
and sometimes almost unfathomable

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:35.570
and sometimes almost unfathomable
 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:40.040
and sometimes almost unfathomable
certainly violates our common sense our

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050
certainly violates our common sense our
 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.479
certainly violates our common sense our
sense of what is common sense and what's

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489
sense of what is common sense and what's
 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.340
sense of what is common sense and what's
intuition but as I like to say the

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350
intuition but as I like to say the
 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.200

universe doesn't care about our common

universe doesn't care about our common
 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.950
universe doesn't care about our common
sense we have to force our ideas to

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960
sense we have to force our ideas to
 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.150
sense we have to force our ideas to
conform to the evidence of reality

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160
conform to the evidence of reality
 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.220
conform to the evidence of reality
rather than the other way around and if

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230
rather than the other way around and if

reality seems strange that's okay in

reality seems strange that's okay in

fact that's what makes science so

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460
fact that's what makes science so
 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.270
fact that's what makes science so
wonderful it expands our minds because

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280
wonderful it expands our minds because
 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.090
wonderful it expands our minds because
it forces us to accept possibilities

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100
it forces us to accept possibilities
 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.280
it forces us to accept possibilities
which in advance we may never have

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290
which in advance we may never have
 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.080

scientists love mysteries and we do

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770
scientists love mysteries and we do
 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.080
scientists love mysteries and we do
that's the reason I'm a scientist

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090
that's the reason I'm a scientist
 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.480
that's the reason I'm a scientist
because it's the puzzles of the universe

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490
because it's the puzzles of the universe
 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.609
because it's the puzzles of the universe
that make it so exciting now it is true

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619
that make it so exciting now it is true
 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.160
that make it so exciting now it is true
that we want to solve resolve those and

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170
that we want to solve resolve those and
 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.080
that we want to solve resolve those and
and solve those puzzles that's part of

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090
and solve those puzzles that's part of
 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.870

the fun of doing Sciences is solving

the fun of doing Sciences is solving
 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.060
the fun of doing Sciences is solving
puzzles basically but each time we do

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070
puzzles basically but each time we do
 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.820
puzzles basically but each time we do
what new questions arise and I think for

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830
what new questions arise and I think for
 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.219
what new questions arise and I think for
many of us just as in our lives the

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229
many of us just as in our lives the
 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.670
many of us just as in our lives the
searching is often much more profound

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680
searching is often much more profound
 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.429
searching is often much more profound
than the finding it's a searching for

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439
than the finding it's a searching for
 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:35.929
than the finding it's a searching for
answers through life in some sense that

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939
answers through life in some sense that
 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.700
answers through life in some sense that
make life worth living if we had all the

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710
make life worth living if we had all the
 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.830
make life worth living if we had all the
answers we could just sit back and stare

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840
answers we could just sit back and stare
 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.420
answers we could just sit back and stare
at our navels and I think what makes the

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430
at our navels and I think what makes the
 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.370
at our navels and I think what makes the
search so exciting is that the answers

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380
search so exciting is that the answers
 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.789
search so exciting is that the answers
are so surprising the universe continues

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799
are so surprising the universe continues
 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.249
are so surprising the universe continues
to surprise us in ways we never would

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259
to surprise us in ways we never would
 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.010
to surprise us in ways we never would
have imagined and well beyond our own

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020
have imagined and well beyond our own
 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.630
have imagined and well beyond our own
imagination in advance and that's why we

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640
imagination in advance and that's why we
 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.700
imagination in advance and that's why we
have to keep exploring the universe we

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710
have to keep exploring the universe we
 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.230
have to keep exploring the universe we
can't just sit in a room and think about

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240
can't just sit in a room and think about
 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.179
can't just sit in a room and think about
it because every time we open a new

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189
it because every time we open a new
 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.010
it because every time we open a new
window on the universe we're surprised

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020
window on the universe we're surprised
 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.219
window on the universe we're surprised
and that makes the whole process

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229
and that makes the whole process
 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:08.309
and that makes the whole process
incredibly exciting

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:08.319
incredibly exciting
 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:10.379
incredibly exciting
