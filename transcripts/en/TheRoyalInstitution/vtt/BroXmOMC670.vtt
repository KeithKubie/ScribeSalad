00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.860
That leads us to a very very simple kind
of musical instrument,

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.440
which just consists of
some blocks of wood.

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.900
If we look at this set of blocks of wood,

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.040
I think you can probably see that they're
all the same length,

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.000
they're all the same width,
but they vary in thickness,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.860
at this end they're quite thin,
and at that end they're quite thick.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.220
And so if I do something rather silly,
which is to drop them on the floor,

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.660
that's why they look so battered,
they are 120 years old,

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:45.580
if I drop them on the floor one en
will go down, hit the floor, bend,

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:49.920
and then because the wood is springy
it will spring back and back again,

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.140
and so it will make changes
in the air pressure

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.620
which are rather like the changes
that Gillian was making

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:56.860
when she was whistling.

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.260
And so we should get a sound,
nothing like as beautiful as the whistle,

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.480
but I think you'll be able to tell
that it is a musical sound.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.100
And as we go to thicker blocks,
because they're harder to bend,

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.040
we shall find  that we get them
springing back quicker

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.060
and so we get a higher frequency.

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:14.820
So now I'm going to drop them on the floor.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.800
[WOODEN CLATTERING SOUND,
MAKES MUSICAL SCALE]

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.460
I think you can hear that we have a scale.

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:29.960
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.380
Well of course that's a very
inconvenient instrument,

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.620
because we end up with all the blocks on the floor and you can't play it again

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:36.260
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.394
But nevertheless here's another version of
the same instrument,

00:01:39.394 --> 00:01:42.380
which is designed not to play a scale,
but to play a little tune

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.020
and we'll try and hope you recognise it

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:55.280
[WOODEN CLATTERING SOUND,

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.480
Well I hope you recognise that.

[APPLAUSE]
