00:00:00.351 --> 00:00:01.563
- [Voiceover] In this
video, I want to talk about

00:00:01.563 --> 00:00:04.192
something called the Jacobian determinant.

00:00:04.192 --> 00:00:05.861
And it's, more or less,
just what it sounds like.

00:00:05.861 --> 00:00:08.210
It's the determinant
of the Jacobian matrix

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:09.484
that I've been talking to you

00:00:09.484 --> 00:00:11.428
the last couple videos about.

00:00:11.428 --> 00:00:12.467
And before we jump into it,

00:00:12.467 --> 00:00:13.587
I just want to give a quick review

00:00:13.587 --> 00:00:15.710
of how you think about
the determinant itself,

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:18.568
just in an ordinary
linear algebra context.

00:00:18.568 --> 00:00:23.532
So if I'm taking the determinant
of some kind of matrix,

00:00:23.532 --> 00:00:26.282
let's say, three, zero, one, two,

00:00:28.605 --> 00:00:30.312
something like this,

00:00:30.312 --> 00:00:31.775
to compute the determinant,

00:00:31.775 --> 00:00:33.916
you take these diagonal terms here,

00:00:33.916 --> 00:00:37.995
so you take three multiplied by that two,

00:00:37.995 --> 00:00:40.704
and then you subtract
off the other diagonal,

00:00:40.704 --> 00:00:43.699
subtract off one multiplied by zero.

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:47.097
And in this case, that evaluates to six.

00:00:47.097 --> 00:00:47.930
But there is, of course,

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.435
much more than just a
computation going on here.

00:00:50.435 --> 00:00:52.674
There's a really nice geometric intuition.

00:00:52.674 --> 00:00:55.721
Namely, if we think of this
matrix, three, zero, one, two,

00:00:55.721 --> 00:00:57.488
as a linear transformation,

00:00:57.488 --> 00:01:00.041
as something that's gonna
take this first basis vector

00:01:00.041 --> 00:01:02.003
over to the coordinates three, zero,

00:01:02.003 --> 00:01:03.321
and that second basis vector

00:01:03.321 --> 00:01:05.270
over to the coordinates one, two,

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:06.908
you know, thinking about the columns,

00:01:06.908 --> 00:01:09.203
you can think of the
determinant as measuring

00:01:09.203 --> 00:01:13.655
how much this transformation
stretches or squishes space.

00:01:13.655 --> 00:01:14.913
And in particular,

00:01:14.913 --> 00:01:17.800
you'll notice how I have this
yellow region highlighted,

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.689
and this region starts
off as the unit square,

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:23.610
a square with side lengths
one so its area is one.

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.694
And there's nothing special
about this particular region.

00:01:25.694 --> 00:01:28.138
It's just nice as a canonical shape,

00:01:28.138 --> 00:01:29.698
with an area of one,

00:01:29.698 --> 00:01:31.131
so that we can compare it to what happens

00:01:31.131 --> 00:01:32.441
after the transformation.

00:01:32.441 --> 00:01:35.368
Ask, how much does that
area get stretched out?

00:01:35.368 --> 00:01:36.378
And the answer is,

00:01:36.378 --> 00:01:39.759
it gets stretched out by a
factor of the determinant.

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:41.767
That's kind of what the determinant means,

00:01:41.767 --> 00:01:44.409
is that all areas, if you were
to draw up any kind of shape,

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:45.796
not just that one square,

00:01:45.796 --> 00:01:48.297
are gonna get stretched
out by a factor of six.

00:01:48.297 --> 00:01:49.400
And we can actually verify,

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.424
looking at this parallelogram
that the square turned into.

00:01:52.424 --> 00:01:54.381
It has a base of three

00:01:54.381 --> 00:01:56.099
and then the height is two.

00:01:56.099 --> 00:01:57.833
And three times two is six.

00:01:57.833 --> 00:01:59.832
And that has everything
to do with the fact that

00:01:59.832 --> 00:02:03.443
this three showed up here
and this two showed up there.

00:02:03.443 --> 00:02:05.003
So now, let's think about
what this might mean

00:02:05.003 --> 00:02:07.152
in the context of what
I've been describing

00:02:07.152 --> 00:02:08.789
in the last couple videos.

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.500
And if you'll remember, we
had a multivariable function,

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.623
something that you can write out as f one

00:02:15.623 --> 00:02:17.013
with two inputs

00:02:17.013 --> 00:02:18.232
and then the second component,

00:02:18.232 --> 00:02:20.565
f two, also with two inputs.

00:02:22.551 --> 00:02:24.118
And the function that I was looking at,

00:02:24.118 --> 00:02:27.373
that we were kind of analyzing
to learn about the Jacobian,

00:02:27.373 --> 00:02:30.853
had the first component, x plus sine of y,

00:02:30.853 --> 00:02:31.979
x plus sine y,

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:36.146
and the second component
was y plus the sine of x.

00:02:37.528 --> 00:02:40.330
And the idea was that this
function is not at all linear.

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.078
It's gonna make everything
very curvy and complicated.

00:02:43.078 --> 00:02:45.684
However, if we zoom in
around a particular region,

00:02:45.684 --> 00:02:49.069
which is what this outer yellow
box represents, zooming in,

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:51.133
it will look like a linear transformation.

00:02:51.133 --> 00:02:53.112
In fact, I can kind of play this forward,

00:02:53.112 --> 00:02:55.405
and we see that even
though everything is crazy,

00:02:55.405 --> 00:02:56.850
inside that zoomed in version,

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.821
things loosely look
like a linear function.

00:02:59.821 --> 00:03:03.248
And you'll notice I have this
inner yellow box highlighted,

00:03:03.248 --> 00:03:05.684
and this yellow box inside
corresponds to the unit square

00:03:05.684 --> 00:03:07.546
that I was showing in the last animation.

00:03:07.546 --> 00:03:10.415
And again, it's just a
placeholder as something to watch

00:03:10.415 --> 00:03:14.136
to see how much the area of
any kind of blob in that region

00:03:14.136 --> 00:03:15.920
gets stretched.

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:16.940
So, in this particular case,

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.368
when you play out the animation,

00:03:18.368 --> 00:03:20.134
areas don't really change that much.

00:03:20.134 --> 00:03:21.705
They get stretched out a little bit,

00:03:21.705 --> 00:03:24.233
but it's not that dramatic.

00:03:24.233 --> 00:03:27.162
So, if we know the matrix that
describes the transformation

00:03:27.162 --> 00:03:29.083
that this looks like zoomed in,

00:03:29.083 --> 00:03:31.100
the determinant of that
matrix will tell us

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.274
the factor by which areas
tend to get stretched out.

00:03:34.274 --> 00:03:36.990
And in particular, you can
think of this little yellow box

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:39.495
and the factor by which it gets stretched.

00:03:39.495 --> 00:03:40.328
And as a reminder,

00:03:40.328 --> 00:03:43.177
the matrix describing that
zoomed in transformation

00:03:43.177 --> 00:03:44.412
is the Jacobian.

00:03:44.412 --> 00:03:46.306
It is this thing that kind of holds

00:03:46.306 --> 00:03:48.860
all of the partial
differential information.

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:51.854
You take the partial derivative of f,

00:03:51.854 --> 00:03:53.173
with respect to x,

00:03:53.173 --> 00:03:55.819
sorry, partial of f one
of that first component,

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:59.279
and then the partial derivative
of the second component,

00:03:59.279 --> 00:04:01.189
with respect to x,

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:03.040
and then on the other column,

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.020
we have the partial derivative
of that first component,

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:08.046
with respect to y,

00:04:08.046 --> 00:04:11.121
and the partial derivative
of that second component,

00:04:11.121 --> 00:04:12.621
with respect to y.

00:04:13.496 --> 00:04:14.622
And if you...

00:04:14.622 --> 00:04:16.962
Let's see, I'm gonna close this off.

00:04:16.962 --> 00:04:18.529
Close off this matrix.

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:21.136
And if you evaluate each one
of these partial derivatives

00:04:21.136 --> 00:04:22.410
at a particular point,

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:25.083
at whatever point we happen to zoom in on,

00:04:25.083 --> 00:04:27.330
in this case, it was negative two, one,

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:28.726
once you plug that into all of these,

00:04:28.726 --> 00:04:32.123
you get some matrix that's
just full of numbers.

00:04:32.123 --> 00:04:34.096
And what turns out to
be a very useful thing

00:04:34.096 --> 00:04:36.396
later on in multivariable calc concepts,

00:04:36.396 --> 00:04:39.130
is to take the determinant of that matrix,

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:41.696
to kind of analyze how much
space is getting stretched

00:04:41.696 --> 00:04:44.285
or squished in that region.

00:04:44.285 --> 00:04:45.704
So in the last video, we worked this out

00:04:45.704 --> 00:04:47.900
for this specific example here,

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:51.214
where that top left function
turned out just to be

00:04:51.214 --> 00:04:52.795
the constant function, one, right,

00:04:52.795 --> 00:04:54.923
because we were taking the
partial derivative of this guy

00:04:54.923 --> 00:04:56.986
with respect to x and that was one.

00:04:56.986 --> 00:04:59.859
And likewise, in the bottom right,

00:04:59.859 --> 00:05:02.168
that was also a constant function of one.

00:05:02.168 --> 00:05:04.515
And then the others were cosine functions.

00:05:04.515 --> 00:05:06.778
This one was cosine x

00:05:06.778 --> 00:05:08.361
because we were taking
the partial derivative

00:05:08.361 --> 00:05:11.678
of this second component
here with respect to x.

00:05:11.678 --> 00:05:13.818
And then the top right of our matrix

00:05:13.818 --> 00:05:15.151
was cosine of y.

00:05:17.058 --> 00:05:18.869
And these are, in general,
functions of x and y

00:05:18.869 --> 00:05:20.351
because you know, you're gonna plug in

00:05:20.351 --> 00:05:22.765
whatever the input point
you're zooming in on.

00:05:22.765 --> 00:05:24.304
And when we're thinking
about the determinant here,

00:05:24.304 --> 00:05:26.137
let's just go ahead and
take the determinant

00:05:26.137 --> 00:05:28.808
in this form, in the form as a function.

00:05:28.808 --> 00:05:32.488
So I'm going to ask about the
determinant of this matrix,

00:05:32.488 --> 00:05:36.065
or maybe you think of it as
a matrix-valued function.

00:05:36.065 --> 00:05:37.678
And in this case, we do the same thing.

00:05:37.678 --> 00:05:39.919
I mean, procedurally, you know
how to take a determinant.

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:41.765
We take these diagonals,

00:05:41.765 --> 00:05:45.020
so that's just gonna be one times one,

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:48.522
and then we subtract off the
product of the other diagonal,

00:05:48.522 --> 00:05:50.522
subtract off cosine of x

00:05:52.504 --> 00:05:54.671
multiplied by cosine of y.

00:05:57.531 --> 00:05:59.239
And as an example, let's
plug in this point here

00:05:59.239 --> 00:06:01.426
that we're zooming in
on, negative two, one.

00:06:01.426 --> 00:06:04.580
So I'm going to plug in x
is equal to negative two,

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:07.140
and y is equal to one.

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:09.518
And when you plug in
cosine of negative two,

00:06:09.518 --> 00:06:13.685
that's gonna come out to be
approximately negative 0.42.

00:06:16.387 --> 00:06:17.961
And when you plug in cosine of y,

00:06:17.961 --> 00:06:20.445
cosine of one in this case,

00:06:20.445 --> 00:06:23.695
that's gonna come out to be about 0.54.

00:06:27.289 --> 00:06:28.613
And when we multiply those,

00:06:28.613 --> 00:06:31.805
when we take one minus
the product of those,

00:06:31.805 --> 00:06:34.722
it's gonna be about negative 0.227.

00:06:37.871 --> 00:06:39.499
And that's all stuff that you
can plug into your calculator

00:06:39.499 --> 00:06:40.572
if you want.

00:06:40.572 --> 00:06:42.767
And what that means is
that the total determinant,

00:06:42.767 --> 00:06:45.423
evaluated at that point,
the Jacobian determinant

00:06:45.423 --> 00:06:48.006
at the point negative two, one,

00:06:49.623 --> 00:06:50.873
is about 1.227.

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:56.334
So that's telling you that
areas tend to get stretched out

00:06:56.334 --> 00:06:58.932
by this factor around that point.

00:06:58.932 --> 00:07:00.345
And that kind of lines
up with what we see.

00:07:00.345 --> 00:07:03.750
We see that areas get stretched
out maybe a little bit,

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:05.045
but not that much, right?

00:07:05.045 --> 00:07:07.596
It's only by a factor of about 1.2.

00:07:07.596 --> 00:07:09.442
And now, let's contrast this.

00:07:09.442 --> 00:07:12.007
If instead we zoom in at the
point where x is equal to zero

00:07:12.007 --> 00:07:13.418
and y is equal to one,

00:07:13.418 --> 00:07:15.838
so I'm gonna go over here
and all I'm gonna change,

00:07:15.838 --> 00:07:18.195
all I'm gonna change is
that x is equal to zero

00:07:18.195 --> 00:07:19.936
and y will still equal one,

00:07:19.936 --> 00:07:22.375
and what that means is that cosine of x,

00:07:22.375 --> 00:07:25.626
instead of being negative 0.42,

00:07:25.626 --> 00:07:27.658
well what's cosine of zero,

00:07:27.658 --> 00:07:31.586
that's actually precisely
equal to one, right?

00:07:31.586 --> 00:07:33.445
We don't have to approximate on this one,

00:07:33.445 --> 00:07:37.253
which means when we multiply
them, one times 0.54,

00:07:37.253 --> 00:07:41.724
well that, that's gonna
now be about 0.54, right?

00:07:41.724 --> 00:07:44.759
So this one, once we actually
perform the subtraction,

00:07:44.759 --> 00:07:48.074
instead when you take one minus 0.54,

00:07:48.074 --> 00:07:50.241
that's gonna give us 0.46.

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:55.777
So even before watching,
because this determinant

00:07:55.777 --> 00:08:00.462
of the Jacobian around the point
zero, one is less than one,

00:08:00.462 --> 00:08:02.435
this is telling us we should expect areas

00:08:02.435 --> 00:08:03.940
to get squished down.

00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:07.401
Precisely, they should be
squished by a factor of 0.46.

00:08:07.401 --> 00:08:08.759
And let's see if this looks right, right?

00:08:08.759 --> 00:08:11.108
We're looking at the zoomed
in version around that point,

00:08:11.108 --> 00:08:14.814
and areas should tend
to contract around that.

00:08:14.814 --> 00:08:16.126
And indeed, they do.

00:08:16.126 --> 00:08:17.484
You see it got squished down,

00:08:17.484 --> 00:08:18.940
it looks like by a fair bit,

00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:19.881
and from our calculation,

00:08:19.881 --> 00:08:22.289
we can conclude that they
got scaled down precisely

00:08:22.289 --> 00:08:24.503
by a factor of 0.46.

00:08:24.503 --> 00:08:27.032
That's what the determinant means.

00:08:27.032 --> 00:08:29.022
So like I said, this is
actually a very nice notion

00:08:29.022 --> 00:08:30.722
throughout multivariable calculus,

00:08:30.722 --> 00:08:33.033
is that you look at a tiny
little local neighborhood

00:08:33.033 --> 00:08:34.396
around a point,

00:08:34.396 --> 00:08:35.932
and if you just want to
get a general feel for,

00:08:35.932 --> 00:08:37.730
does this function, as a transformation,

00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:40.830
tend to stretch out that region
or to squish it together,

00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:43.972
how much do areas change in
that little neighborhood,

00:08:43.972 --> 00:08:47.048
that's exactly what this
Jacobian determinant is,

00:08:47.048 --> 00:08:49.131
you know, built to solve.

00:08:50.334 --> 00:08:52.430
So with that, I'll see
you guys next video.
