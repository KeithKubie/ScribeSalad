let me briefly describe the difference

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.370
let me briefly describe the difference
 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:03.889
let me briefly describe the difference
between a quantum computer and a regular

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:03.899
between a quantum computer and a regular
 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:06.440
between a quantum computer and a regular
computer at some level in a regular

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450
computer at some level in a regular
 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.540
computer at some level in a regular
computer you got ones and zeros which

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550
computer you got ones and zeros which
 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.100
computer you got ones and zeros which
you store in binary form and you

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110
you store in binary form and you
 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.330
you store in binary form and you
manipulate them and they do calculations

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340
manipulate them and they do calculations
 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.410
manipulate them and they do calculations
you can store them for example by in a

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:17.420
you can store them for example by in a
 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.939
you can store them for example by in a
way that's that at least I can argue

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949
way that's that at least I can argue
 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.650
way that's that at least I can argue
simply let's say you have an elementary

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660
simply let's say you have an elementary
 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.000
simply let's say you have an elementary
particle that's spinning if it's

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010
particle that's spinning if it's
 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.070
particle that's spinning if it's
spinning and and that we say it's

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080
spinning and and that we say it's
 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.359
spinning and and that we say it's
spinning it's pointing up or down

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369
spinning it's pointing up or down
 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:27.470
spinning it's pointing up or down
depending on whether it spinning this

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480
depending on whether it spinning this
 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.599
depending on whether it spinning this
way or this way pointing up or down and

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609
way or this way pointing up or down and
 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.640
way or this way pointing up or down and
so I could store the information by

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650
so I could store the information by
 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.350
so I could store the information by
having lots of particles and some of

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360
having lots of particles and some of
 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.430
having lots of particles and some of
them spinning up and some of them

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440
them spinning up and some of them
 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.459
them spinning up and some of them
spinning down right ones and zeros but

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469
spinning down right ones and zeros but
 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.830
spinning down right ones and zeros but
in the quantum world it turns out that

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840
in the quantum world it turns out that
 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.170
in the quantum world it turns out that
particles like electrons are actually

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180
particles like electrons are actually
 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.850
particles like electrons are actually
spinning in all directions at the same

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860
spinning in all directions at the same
 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.369
spinning in all directions at the same
time one of the weird aspects of quantum

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379
time one of the weird aspects of quantum
 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.500
time one of the weird aspects of quantum
mechanics we may measure by doing a

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510
mechanics we may measure by doing a
 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.240
mechanics we may measure by doing a
measurement of an electron find it's

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250
measurement of an electron find it's
 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.160
measurement of an electron find it's
spinning this way but before we did the

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170
spinning this way but before we did the
 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.200
spinning this way but before we did the
measurement it was spinning this way and

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210
measurement it was spinning this way and
 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.850
measurement it was spinning this way and
this way and that way and that way all

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860
this way and that way and that way all
 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.810
this way and that way and that way all
at the same time sounds crazy but true

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820
at the same time sounds crazy but true
 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.840
at the same time sounds crazy but true
now that means if the electron spinning

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850
now that means if the electron spinning
 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:03.950
now that means if the electron spinning
in many different directions at the same

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960
in many different directions at the same
 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.370
in many different directions at the same
time if we don't actually measure it it

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380
time if we don't actually measure it it
 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.410
time if we don't actually measure it it
can be doing many computations at the

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420
can be doing many computations at the
 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.200
can be doing many computations at the
same time and so a quantum computer is

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210
same time and so a quantum computer is
 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.179
same time and so a quantum computer is
based on manipulating the state of

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189
based on manipulating the state of
 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.149
based on manipulating the state of
particles like electrons so that during

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159
particles like electrons so that during
 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.679
particles like electrons so that during
the calculation many different

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689
the calculation many different
 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.120
the calculation many different
calculations are being performed at the

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130
calculations are being performed at the
 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.160
calculations are being performed at the
same time and only making a measurement

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170
same time and only making a measurement
 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.310
same time and only making a measurement
at the end of the computation so we

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320
at the end of the computation so we
 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.380
at the end of the computation so we
exploit that fact of quantum mechanics

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390
exploit that fact of quantum mechanics
 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.359
exploit that fact of quantum mechanics
that particles can do many things at the

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369
that particles can do many things at the
 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.880
that particles can do many things at the
same time to do many computations at the

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890
same time to do many computations at the
 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.010
same time to do many computations at the
same time and that's what would make a

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020
same time and that's what would make a
 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.980
same time and that's what would make a
quantum computer so powerful one of the

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990
quantum computer so powerful one of the
 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.420
quantum computer so powerful one of the
reasons it's so difficult to make a

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430
reasons it's so difficult to make a
 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.770
reasons it's so difficult to make a
quantum computer and one of the reasons

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780
quantum computer and one of the reasons
 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.120
quantum computer and one of the reasons
I'm a little skeptical at the moment is

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130
I'm a little skeptical at the moment is
 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.460
I'm a little skeptical at the moment is
that the reason the quantum world seems

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470
that the reason the quantum world seems
 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.139
that the reason the quantum world seems
so strange to us is that we don't behave

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149
so strange to us is that we don't behave
 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.050
so strange to us is that we don't behave
quantum mechanically I don't you know

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060
quantum mechanically I don't you know
 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.780

you can not me but you could run towards
 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.389
you can not me but you could run towards
the wall behind us up from now to the

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399
the wall behind us up from now to the
 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.429
the wall behind us up from now to the
end of the universe and bang your head

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439
end of the universe and bang your head
 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.410
end of the universe and bang your head
into it and you just get a tremendous

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.120

headache but if you're an electron

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130
headache but if you're an electron
 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.819

there's a probability if I throw it

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829
there's a probability if I throw it
 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:02.990
there's a probability if I throw it
towards the wall that it will disappear

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000
towards the wall that it will disappear
 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.060
towards the wall that it will disappear
and appear on the other side to

and appear on the other side to
something called quantum tunneling ok

those weird quantum behaviors are

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149
those weird quantum behaviors are
 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.559
those weird quantum behaviors are
manifest on small scales we don't obey

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080
quantum mechanics and tell us in some
 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.810
quantum mechanics and tell us in some
sense that when you have many particles

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820
sense that when you have many particles
 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.810
sense that when you have many particles
interacting at some level those weird

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820
interacting at some level those weird
 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.460
interacting at some level those weird
quantum mechanical correlations that

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470
quantum mechanical correlations that
 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.560
quantum mechanical correlations that
produce all the strange phenomena wash

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570
produce all the strange phenomena wash
 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.220
produce all the strange phenomena wash
away and so in order to have a quantum

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230
away and so in order to have a quantum
 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.410
away and so in order to have a quantum
mechanical state where you can

weird quantum properties in some sense

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080

you have to isolate that system from all

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260
you have to isolate that system from all
 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.660
you have to isolate that system from all
of its environment because if it

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670
of its environment because if it

interacts with the environment the

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260
interacts with the environment the
 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.230
interacts with the environment the
quantum mechanical weirdness sort of

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240
quantum mechanical weirdness sort of
 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.870
quantum mechanical weirdness sort of
washes away and that's the problem with

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880
washes away and that's the problem with
 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.340
washes away and that's the problem with
that with a quantum computer you want to

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350
that with a quantum computer you want to
 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.470
that with a quantum computer you want to
make this macroscopic object you want to

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480
make this macroscopic object you want to
 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.940
make this macroscopic object you want to
keep it behaving quantum mechanically

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950
keep it behaving quantum mechanically
 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.010
keep it behaving quantum mechanically
which means isolating it very carefully

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020
which means isolating it very carefully
 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.650
which means isolating it very carefully
from within itself all the interactions

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660
from within itself all the interactions
 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.170
from within itself all the interactions
and the outside world and that's the

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180
and the outside world and that's the
 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.650
and the outside world and that's the
hard part is isolating things enough to

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660
hard part is isolating things enough to
 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.210
hard part is isolating things enough to
maintain this what's called quantum

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220
maintain this what's called quantum
 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.700
maintain this what's called quantum
coherence and that's the challenge and

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:07.710
coherence and that's the challenge and
 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:10.940
coherence and that's the challenge and
it's a huge challenge but the potential

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950
it's a huge challenge but the potential
 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.610
it's a huge challenge but the potential
isn't unbelievably great once you can

set as we say if we created a quantum
 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.830

computer and I'm not I must admit I'm

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840
computer and I'm not I must admit I'm

skeptical that we'll be able to do that

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250
skeptical that we'll be able to do that
 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.640
skeptical that we'll be able to do that
in the near term but if we could we'd be

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650
in the near term but if we could we'd be
 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.430
in the near term but if we could we'd be
able to do computations in a finite time

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440
able to do computations in a finite time
 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:35.720
able to do computations in a finite time
that would take longer than the age of

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730
that would take longer than the age of
 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.090
that would take longer than the age of
the universe right now we'd be able to

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100
the universe right now we'd be able to
 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:39.770
the universe right now we'd be able to
do strange and wonderful things and of

course if you ask me what's the next big

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940
course if you ask me what's the next big
 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.600
course if you ask me what's the next big
breakthrough I'll tell you what I always

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610
breakthrough I'll tell you what I always
 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:46.100

tell people which is if I knew I'd be

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110
tell people which is if I knew I'd be
 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:49.290
