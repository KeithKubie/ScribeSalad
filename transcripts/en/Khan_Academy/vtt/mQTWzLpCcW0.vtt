00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:03.750
Welcome to the logarithm
presentation.

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.000
Let me write down the word
logarithm just because it is

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.930
another strange and unusual
word like hypotenuse and it's

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:10.700
good to at least, see it once.

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.520
Let me get the pen
tool working.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:14.980
Logarithm.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.620
This is one of my most
misspelled words.

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:27.300
I went to MIT and actually one
of the a cappella groups there,

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.050
they were called
the Logarhythms.

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:31.710
Like rhythm, like music.

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.990
But anyway, I'm digressing.

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:35.730
So what is a logarithm?

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.790
Well, the easiest way to
explain what a logarithm is is

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.370
to have first-- I guess it's
just to say it's the inverse of

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.140
taking the exponent
of something.

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.250
Let me explain.

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.900
If I said that 2 to the third
power-- well, we know that

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.120
from the exponent modules.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.770
2 the third power, well
that's equal to 8.

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:56.830
And once again, this
is a 2, it's not a z.

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:59.530
2 to the third power is 8, so
it actually turns out that

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:04.580
log-- and log is short
for the word logarithm.

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:13.200
Log base 2 of eight
is equal to 3.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.130
I think when you look at that
you're trying to say oh,

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.210
that's trying to make
a little bit of sense.

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:22.730
What this says, if I were to
ask you what log base 2 of

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:27.770
8 is, this says 2 to the
what power is equal to 8?

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.060
So the answer to a logarithm--
you can say the answer to this

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.880
logarithm expression, or if you
evaluate this logarithm

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.440
expression, you should get a
number that is really the

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:42.320
exponent that you would have
to raised 2 to to get 8.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:43.970
And once again, that's 3.

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.560
Let's do a couple more examples
and I think you might get it.

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:54.690
If I were to say log--
what happened to my pen?

00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:03.710
log base 4 of 64 is equal to x.

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:09.820
Another way of rewriting this
exact equation is to say 4 to

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:14.230
the x power is equal to 64.

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.790
Or another way to think
about it, 4 to what

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.290
power is equal to 64?

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.960
Well, we know that 4 to
the third power is 64.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:25.950
So we know that in this
case, this equals 3.

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:36.120
So log base 4 of
64 is equal to 3.

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.320
Let me do a bunch of more
examples and I think the more

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.260
examples you see, it'll
start to make some sense.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.720
Logarithms are a simple idea,
but I think they can get

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.980
confusing because they're the
inverse of exponentiation,

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.390
which is sometimes itself,
a confusing concept.

00:02:52.390 --> 00:03:05.780
So what is log base 10 of
let's say, 1,000,000.

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.540
Put some commas
here to make sure.

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.490
So this equals question mark.

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:15.960
Well, all we have to ask
ourselves is 10 to what power

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.770
is equal to 1,000,000.

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:22.060
And 10 to any power is actually
equal to 1 followed by the

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.900
power of-- if you say 10 of
the fifth power, that's equal

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.930
to 1 followed by five 0's.

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.550
So if we have 1 followed by six
0's this is the same thing

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:31.350
as 10 to the sixth power.

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:34.590
So 10 to the sixth power
is equal to 1,000,000.

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:47.170
So since 10 to the sixth power
is equal to 1,000,000 log base

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:54.060
10 of 1,000,000 is equal to 6.

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.740
Just remember, this 6 is an
exponent that we raise 10

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:59.640
to to get the 1,000,000.

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.460
I know I'm saying this in a
hundred different ways and

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:04.200
hopefully, one or two of these
million different ways that I'm

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.310
explaining it actually
will make sense.

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.830
Let's do some more.

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:12.570
Actually, I'll do even a
slightly confusing one.

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:19.790
log base 1/2 of 1/8.

00:04:23.252 --> 00:04:25.820
Let's say that that equals x.

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:27.760
So let's just remind
ourselves, that's just

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:32.050
like saying 1/2-- whoops.

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.670
1/2.

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:34.280
That's supposed to
be parentheses.

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:37.020
To the x power is equal to 1/8.

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.490
Well, we know that 1/2 to the
third power is equal to 1/8.

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:54.766
So log base 1/2 of
1/8 is equal to 3.

00:04:54.766 --> 00:04:56.275
Let me do a bunch
of more problems.

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:02.290
Actually, let me mix
it up a little bit.

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:13.680
Let's say that log base
x of 27 is equal to 3.

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.480
What's x?

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:20.520
Well, just like what we did
before, this says that x to the

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.790
third power is equal to 27.

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:34.060
Or x is equal to the
cubed root of 27.

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.170
And all that means is that
there's some number times

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:38.160
itself three times
that equals 27.

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:39.740
And I think at this point
you know that that

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:41.370
number would be 3.

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:43.150
x equals 3.

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:51.060
So we could write log base
3 of 27 is equal to 3.

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:55.830
Let me think of
another example.

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:57.750
I'm only doing relatively small
numbers because I don't have

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:00.050
a calculator with me and I
have to do them in my head.

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:07.710
So what is log-- let
me think about this.

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:14.440
What is log base 100 of 1?

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:16.690
This is a trick problem.

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:18.380
So once again, let's just
say that this is equal

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:22.440
to question mark.

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:25.330
So remember this is log
base 100 hundred of 1.

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:30.250
So this says 100 to the
question mark power

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:32.720
is equal to 1.

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:34.960
Well, what do we have to
raise-- if we have any number

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:37.530
and we raise it to what
power, when do we get 1?

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:39.790
Well, if you remember from the
exponent rules, or actually not

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:42.470
the exponent rules, from the
exponent modules, anything to

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:44.880
the 0-th power is equal to 1.

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:51.330
So we could say 100 to
the 0 power equals 1.

00:06:51.330 --> 00:07:00.410
So we could say log base 100
hundred of 1 is equal to 0

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:04.930
because 100 to the 0-th
power is equal to 1.

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:07.860
Let me ask another question.

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:16.120
What if I were to ask you
log, let's say base 2 of 0?

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:18.060
So what is that equal to?

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:20.330
Well, what I'm asking you,
I'm saying 2-- let's

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:22.160
say that equals x.

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:25.770
2 to some power x
is equal to 0.

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:28.430
So what is x?

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:30.580
Well, is there anything
that I can raise 2 to

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:32.850
the power of to get 0?

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:33.790
No.

00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:35.830
So this is undefined.

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:38.710
Undefined or no solution.

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:41.990
There's no number that
I can raise 2 to the

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:44.440
power of and get 0.

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:51.320
Similarly if I were to
ask you log base 3 of

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:54.210
let's say, negative 1.

00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:56.810
And we're assuming we're
dealing with the real numbers,

00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:58.630
which are most of the numbers
that I think at this point

00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:00.440
you have dealt with.

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:02.660
There's nothing I can raise
three 3 to the power of to

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:04.240
get a negative number,
so this is undefined.

00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:14.620
So as long as you have a
positive base here, this

00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:21.380
number, in order to be defined,
has to be greater than-- well,

00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:23.680
it has to be greater
than or equal-- no.

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:25.590
It has to be greater than 0.

00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:26.210
Not equal to.

00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:28.980
It cannot be 0 and it
cannot be negative.

00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:30.020
Let's do a couple
more problems.

00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:32.350
I think I have another
minute and a half.

00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:36.390
You're already prepared to do
the level 1 logarithms module,

00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:39.240
but let's do a couple of more.

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:47.130
What is log base 8-- I'm
going to do a slightly

00:08:47.130 --> 00:08:52.510
tricky one-- of 1/64.

00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:53.940
Interesting.

00:08:53.940 --> 00:09:00.010
We know that log base 8 of
64 would equal 2, right?

00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:02.800
Because 8 squared
is equal to 64.

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:06.240
But 8 to what power
equals 1/64?

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:09.320
Well, we learned from the
negative exponent module that

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:13.030
that is equal to negative 2.

00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:17.610
If you remember, 8 to the
negative 2 power is the same

00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:20.230
thing as 1/8 to the 2 power.

00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:24.960
8 squared, which
is equal to 1/64.

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:26.960
Interesting.

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:29.590
I'll leave this for
you to think about.

00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:31.590
When you take the inverse of
whatever you're taking the

00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:33.830
logarithm of, it turns
the answer negative.

00:09:33.830 --> 00:09:36.260
And we'll do a lot more
logarithm problems and explore

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.880
a lot more of the properties of
logarithms in future modules.

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:43.120
But I think you're ready at
this point to do the level 1

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:45.770
logarithm set of exercises.

00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:47.600
See you in the next module.
