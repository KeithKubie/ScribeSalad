00:00:00.794 --> 00:00:02.875
Voiceover:It's useful to
make an invertible function

00:00:02.875 --> 00:00:04.731
from one that is not invertible

00:00:04.731 --> 00:00:06.524
by restricting it's domain.

00:00:06.524 --> 00:00:09.011
The graph of f(x) is shown below.

00:00:09.011 --> 00:00:10.318
To which intervals could we

00:00:10.318 --> 00:00:14.199
restrict f(x) to get
an invertible function?

00:00:14.308 --> 00:00:17.716
So in order for a
function to be invertible,

00:00:17.716 --> 00:00:21.940
it's inverse relationship
has to be a function as well.

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:23.459
What do I mean by that?

00:00:23.459 --> 00:00:24.731
Well let's show that this one

00:00:24.731 --> 00:00:26.990
right over here is not invertible.

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:28.931
And there's a couple of ways
you could think about it.

00:00:28.931 --> 00:00:32.019
F is clearly a function, it
passes the vertical line test.

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:33.996
Vertical line test, you take
a vertical line anywhere

00:00:33.996 --> 00:00:37.235
in this graph and it doesn't
intersect more than one time.

00:00:37.235 --> 00:00:39.059
So here it only intersects once.

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.699
Why does that help us think

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:42.315
about whether this is a function?

00:00:42.315 --> 00:00:44.019
Well imagine if it did intersect.

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:46.214
Imagine if the function was
a circle right over here.

00:00:46.214 --> 00:00:47.395
So imagine if the vertical line

00:00:47.395 --> 00:00:49.740
did intersect the
function twice like this.

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.401
Well then what would f of 6 be?

00:00:51.401 --> 00:00:53.001
Is it 2 or is it negative 2?

00:00:53.001 --> 00:00:55.061
F of 6 needs to map to a unique value,

00:00:55.061 --> 00:00:56.825
you need to know what f of 6 is

00:00:56.825 --> 00:00:58.805
and here you wouldn't now.

00:00:58.805 --> 00:01:00.335
So that's the vertical line test

00:01:00.335 --> 00:01:02.709
for testing whether
something is a function

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:05.925
but you could also apply
a horizontal line test

00:01:05.925 --> 00:01:08.493
to test whether it's inverse,

00:01:08.493 --> 00:01:10.413
the inverse relationship is a function.

00:01:10.413 --> 00:01:12.645
Or whether this is invertible.

00:01:12.645 --> 00:01:13.917
One way to think about it is

00:01:13.917 --> 00:01:16.157
if you swap the x and y values here,

00:01:16.157 --> 00:01:17.753
the graph of this function

00:01:17.753 --> 00:01:20.237
is going to look something like this.

00:01:20.237 --> 00:01:21.605
The graph of this function is

00:01:21.605 --> 00:01:23.638
going to look something like this.

00:01:23.638 --> 00:01:26.837
So let me see, actually it's
not going to look like that.

00:01:26.837 --> 00:01:31.059
It's going to look, it's
going to look like this.

00:01:31.333 --> 00:01:34.761
It's going to look like this,

00:01:34.938 --> 00:01:37.173
let me draw this as neatly as I can.

00:01:37.173 --> 00:01:38.893
I think you get the idea.

00:01:38.893 --> 00:01:44.464
So like that and and like that.

00:01:44.464 --> 00:01:45.629
So it's going to look like that

00:01:45.629 --> 00:01:48.685
if you were to take the
inverse relationship,

00:01:48.685 --> 00:01:51.038
if you were to swap the x and y's

00:01:51.038 --> 00:01:54.989
and now this clearly would not
pass the vertical line test.

00:01:54.989 --> 00:01:58.077
That clearly would not pass
the vertical line test.

00:01:58.077 --> 00:01:59.573
Or another way to think about it

00:01:59.573 --> 00:02:02.765
is we could just apply
a horizontal line test,

00:02:02.765 --> 00:02:04.949
we could apply a horizontal line test,

00:02:04.949 --> 00:02:06.781
let me clean it up a little bit,

00:02:06.781 --> 00:02:10.398
to our original function to
test whether it is invertible.

00:02:10.398 --> 00:02:13.485
The horizontal line
test, it clearly fails.

00:02:13.485 --> 00:02:14.753
Now once again, why does that

00:02:14.753 --> 00:02:16.405
show that that's not invertible?

00:02:16.405 --> 00:02:18.829
Actually let me do it on
a value that's easier to,

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:21.509
even here we see a horizontal line

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:26.774
is intersecting the function
there, there, there and there.

00:02:26.774 --> 00:02:28.677
Now why is that a problem?

00:02:28.677 --> 00:02:30.013
Well, let's just remind ourselves

00:02:30.013 --> 00:02:31.965
what a function and an
inverse function do.

00:02:31.965 --> 00:02:33.309
They're just mappings from the...

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:34.509
The function is a mapping

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:36.421
from the domain to the range.

00:02:36.421 --> 00:02:38.782
So let's say this is the domain.

00:02:38.782 --> 00:02:40.277
Domain.

00:02:40.277 --> 00:02:42.903
And this is the range.

00:02:44.164 --> 00:02:45.707
This is the range.

00:02:45.707 --> 00:02:46.883
And so our function is clearly,

00:02:46.883 --> 00:02:48.147
let's just take 2 of these values.

00:02:48.147 --> 00:02:50.835
Our function takes 2 in the domain

00:02:50.835 --> 00:02:54.419
and maps it to 2 in the range.

00:02:54.419 --> 00:02:56.411
So the function does that, f of 2 is 2.

00:02:56.411 --> 00:02:58.172
We see that right over here.

00:02:58.172 --> 00:03:00.379
And it takes 6 and it also maps it to 2.

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:06.401
F of 6 is also, is also, equal to 2.

00:03:06.401 --> 00:03:08.532
Now this is fine for f being a function

00:03:08.532 --> 00:03:10.100
but it introduces a problem when

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.372
we're trying to take the
inverse relationship.

00:03:12.372 --> 00:03:14.308
The inverse relationship all of a sudden,

00:03:14.308 --> 00:03:16.356
if i'm trying to set up f inverse,

00:03:16.356 --> 00:03:21.301
should f inverse, what should
f inverse of 2 be equal to?

00:03:21.301 --> 00:03:23.932
Should it be equal to 6?

00:03:23.932 --> 00:03:25.860
So should it be equal to 6?

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.220
Or should it be equal or
should it be equal to 2?

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.996
And so this is the problem.

00:03:30.996 --> 00:03:33.060
When you have multiple
elements in the domain

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.884
mapping to the same element in the range,

00:03:35.884 --> 00:03:38.460
that's okay for being a function

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:40.772
but then when you're trying to find to map

00:03:40.772 --> 00:03:41.984
from that element to the range

00:03:41.984 --> 00:03:43.444
to those multiple elements in the domain,

00:03:43.444 --> 00:03:45.148
that is no longer a function.

00:03:45.148 --> 00:03:47.380
This is not invertible.

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.524
So essentially when we
look at the intervals

00:03:49.524 --> 00:03:50.780
that we could restrict through

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.660
to get an invertible function
it essentially would be

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:55.444
intervals where the thing would

00:03:55.444 --> 00:03:57.548
pass that horizontal line test.

00:03:57.548 --> 00:03:59.636
Where over that interval, every member

00:03:59.636 --> 00:04:02.020
of that domain, that restricted domain,

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:06.820
maps to a only, there's
a one to one mapping

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:08.892
between each member of that domain

00:04:08.892 --> 00:04:12.948
and a member of the new restricted range,

00:04:12.948 --> 00:04:14.693
or potentially restricted range.

00:04:14.693 --> 00:04:16.548
So let's think about these, these,

00:04:16.548 --> 00:04:20.676
let's think about these
different restricted domains.

00:04:20.676 --> 00:04:23.732
So if we think about from negative 2 to 2,

00:04:23.732 --> 00:04:26.516
so from negative 2 to 2
including negative 2 and 2.

00:04:26.516 --> 00:04:27.852
So this is a closed interval.

00:04:27.852 --> 00:04:28.900
We have brackets here.

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.404
Actually all of these
are closed intervals.

00:04:30.404 --> 00:04:32.156
Notice it does not pass
the horizontal line test.

00:04:32.156 --> 00:04:35.908
F of negative 2 and f of 2 both map to 2

00:04:35.908 --> 00:04:38.244
and so we don't know what
f inverse of 2 should be.

00:04:38.244 --> 00:04:40.204
And you could put a horizontal
line right over there,

00:04:40.204 --> 00:04:41.700
makes it very clear that this

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.204
is not passing the horizontal line test.

00:04:44.204 --> 00:04:46.316
So let me clear this up a little.

00:04:46.316 --> 00:04:49.437
So let's rule out the first interval.

00:04:49.437 --> 00:04:51.869
Now the second one, between 0 and 4.

00:04:51.869 --> 00:04:54.048
0 and 4.

00:04:54.048 --> 00:04:57.330
Once again, not passing
the horizontal line test.

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:58.962
Rule that out.

00:04:58.962 --> 00:05:00.171
Negative 8 to 8.

00:05:00.171 --> 00:05:01.498
Well that doesn't even restrict the domain

00:05:01.498 --> 00:05:02.658
relative to what we had before

00:05:02.658 --> 00:05:04.406
so that's not going to work.

00:05:04.406 --> 00:05:06.977
6 to 8, now this is interesting.

00:05:06.977 --> 00:05:10.624
Between 6 and 8, you do
have a 1 to 1 mapping

00:05:10.624 --> 00:05:13.568
between elements of the domain
and elements of the range.

00:05:13.568 --> 00:05:17.272
Notice between 6 and 8
it does, it does pass,

00:05:17.272 --> 00:05:20.096
it does pass the horizontal line test.

00:05:20.096 --> 00:05:22.800
So this is a legitimate
restriction of the domain.

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.504
So if we restricted the
domain of the function

00:05:24.504 --> 00:05:27.456
to just that, it would be invertible.

00:05:27.456 --> 00:05:28.343
It would be invertible.

00:05:28.343 --> 00:05:30.395
In fact, we could draw it's inverse.

00:05:30.395 --> 00:05:31.952
It's inverse would look like this.

00:05:31.952 --> 00:05:37.925
So, f of 6 is 2, so f
inverse of 2 should be 6

00:05:38.269 --> 00:05:43.517
and f of 8 is 0 so f
inverse of 0 should be 8.

00:05:43.937 --> 00:05:46.776
So it's inverse will look like this,

00:05:46.776 --> 00:05:48.432
it's inverse would look like this

00:05:48.432 --> 00:05:53.378
which is clearly a reflection
over the line, y equals x.

00:05:53.378 --> 00:05:55.312
Clearly a reflection over that line

00:05:55.312 --> 00:05:57.584
you see it over here, it's a reflection.

00:05:57.584 --> 00:06:02.048
And this, this inverse
function is clearly a function.

00:06:02.048 --> 00:06:04.192
It passes the vertical line
test for the same reason

00:06:04.192 --> 00:06:05.851
this passes the horizontal line test.

00:06:05.851 --> 00:06:07.512
So this is really good.

00:06:07.512 --> 00:06:10.632
So let's see negative 8 to negative 6.

00:06:10.632 --> 00:06:13.168
Well, yeah that's the same
thing on the other side.

00:06:13.168 --> 00:06:16.128
So negative 8 to negative 6, once again

00:06:16.128 --> 00:06:19.200
over this interval we do pass
the horizontal line test.

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:20.800
So that looks good as well.

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.048
And then 0 to 2.

00:06:23.048 --> 00:06:26.440
From 0 to 2, yeah it does
look like over that interval

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:29.464
we pass the horizontal line test.

00:06:29.464 --> 23:59:59.999
So that looks good as well.
