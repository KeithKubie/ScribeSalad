00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:02.410
Do you want to get out? Is this a, is this us? Yes, this is okay.

2
00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:08.490
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

3
00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.440
<v 0>this is Radiolab. I'm Jad Abumrad.</v>

4
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.620
Since our program today deals with stumbling upon the past in unlikely places,

5
00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:18.420
cause always begin this part of the show,

6
00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:21.930
not at a place we'd normally visit.

7
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.610
So I feel like we're standing on top of a mountain. But how high up are we?

8
00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.220
Right here? I believe we're about 180 this by the way, is chief Dennis Diggins.

9
00:00:32.221 --> 00:00:35.010
I'm an assistant chief in the New York City Department of sanitation.

10
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.690
And when he says 180 he means feet at 180 feet high. Wow.

11
00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.970
So that's about 18 stories. Correct.

12
00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.930
18 stories up into the Staten island sky. That's where we're standing,

13
00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:48.390
where we're standing on the hill, basically like a big dirt hill.

14
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.711
And in a glance,

15
00:00:49.711 --> 00:00:53.010
you'd never know that this hill was made from anything other than dirt.

16
00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.910
What did this used to be? Unless of course you dug about a few feet down.

17
00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:58.650
This is all garbage underneath this.

18
00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.750
Up until March of 2001 we were taking in all of New York city's garbage.

19
00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.210
All the burrows were coming here, all the burrows were coming here.

20
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.470
So we are probably taking in on average 11,000 tons a day.

21
00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.300
11,000 tons a day. That's what does 11,000 tons look like.

22
00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.080
That's a lot of car Freshkills used to be the biggest empire dominate on the

23
00:01:22.081 --> 00:01:25.830
planet. That's all in the past. You magic with a little engineering help,

24
00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.020
it's gotta be a great park. Absolutely. Yes.

25
00:01:28.021 --> 00:01:31.200
We'll be a park and just look at how much property have you told these mounts

26
00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.490
are getting wrapped in plastic and covered with grass. There'll be a restaurant.

27
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.960
Can almost imagine that. I've been a golf course. Yeah.

28
00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.060
I would love to be the first ones to tee off on that,

29
00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:44.310
but underneath it all the garbage will still be here.

30
00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.870
50 years of trash waiting patiently

31
00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.060
until someone comes to look for it and someone always does.

32
00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.500
I know years ago we hit,

33
00:01:56.501 --> 00:02:01.410
there was a a a garb at arc arc it,

34
00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.750
how do I say it, right? Archeological garbage man, the cave here.

35
00:02:06.751 --> 00:02:09.180
And he did some core sampling meeting with a special tool.

36
00:02:09.181 --> 00:02:11.850
This guy bored a hole deep into the center of the Mount,

37
00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.910
actually came up with a hotdog landfill 10 years previously.

38
00:02:17.371 --> 00:02:21.690
So hitting the hot dog that's 10 years old and it still a hot dog,

39
00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.140
recognizably a hot dog, the hot dog. So that's a,

40
00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:26.880
that's amazing and disgusting.

41
00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.060
I still like hotdog so I'll eat it. Seriously.

42
00:02:33.061 --> 00:02:35.730
Do you ever consider the history that's contained in this,

43
00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.980
in this big chunk of garbage? Oh yeah.

44
00:02:37.981 --> 00:02:41.640
Well this is one big time capsule time capsule time, capsule time,

45
00:02:41.641 --> 00:02:46.470
capsule time capsule times that time capsule time, capsule time, capsule time,

46
00:02:46.471 --> 00:02:50.250
capsule time capsule you can set up can stop saying that now. Thank you.

47
00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.050
I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich.

48
00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:57.110
This is radio lab series about science and discovery and that is exactly what we

49
00:02:57.181 --> 00:02:59.560
have for you today. Three detective stories.

50
00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.390
And each one begins with a rather peculiar clue clues that leads you back into

51
00:03:04.391 --> 00:03:07.240
the past time capsule time capsule.

52
00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.720
And now that we've got that phrase in our minds and garbage as well,

53
00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:13.540
let's go to a different part of the world.

54
00:03:13.541 --> 00:03:15.910
And get things started for real to a different time. Also,

55
00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:21.400
1898 Egypt Oxa Rinkus Egypt. You with me?

56
00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:25.750
Where's Oxa? Rinkus Egypt. It's in the south, in the desert, south of uh,

57
00:03:25.751 --> 00:03:28.570
of Cairo I think. And let me show you a picture.

58
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.800
You see the desert? Oh yeah.

59
00:03:32.801 --> 00:03:37.300
It's a big flat sort of sandy place and he's, who is this guy? Well,

60
00:03:37.301 --> 00:03:38.740
you should see two guys. They are a,

61
00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.610
they're two Oxford archeologists with a pit helmet and sort of standing high on

62
00:03:42.611 --> 00:03:45.340
a mountain looking down, you know, one guy is on top of the mountain,

63
00:03:45.341 --> 00:03:49.030
the other guy is toward the bottom that's Grenfell and hunt to Oxford

64
00:03:49.031 --> 00:03:49.780
archeologists.

65
00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:54.780
They were in Egypt in 1898 looking for treasure and they find those sand dunes,

66
00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.840
which don't look quite like the other sand dunes really.

67
00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.880
They're sort of strange and irregularly shaped,

68
00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:03.700
which is why when they saw those Sandana and you're looking at,

69
00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:07.780
they hired a team of workers and they started to dig

70
00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:11.610
and they immediately began to find them.

71
00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:16.310
<v 2>It's huge quantity of pottery flows, shoes, baskets, rope.</v>

72
00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:18.860
<v 0>That's Derrick ob scholar from Oxford.</v>

73
00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:21.490
He tells the story of what they found and what they found was basic.

74
00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:26.900
<v 2>Typically the mother load a huge circle of rubbish mounds over 20 of them that</v>

75
00:04:27.881 --> 00:04:29.320
were completely undisturbed.

76
00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:34.100
<v 0>Oh, thought this was no piddly little trash heap that was 50 years old like you</v>

77
00:04:34.101 --> 00:04:38.300
might find in Staten Island. These mounds. Whew. [inaudible].

78
00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:42.300
<v 2>These were rubbish mounts that had built up over the course of 10 centuries,</v>

79
00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:45.650
<v 0>10 centuries of trash.</v>

80
00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:49.130
That's a a thousand years of trash. Yeah,

81
00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:51.560
and that included a lot of ancient paper.

82
00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:54.350
That's what they were really interested in.

83
00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:56.420
Any scraps or squirrels they could find,

84
00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:01.500
<v 2>and one of the first ones that they pulled out of the ground was last sayings of</v>

85
00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:06.070
Jesus. Wow. Oh, that was the first one that they pulled out of the ground.

86
00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:10.020
<v 0>He who knows the all but fails to know himself,</v>

87
00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:15.240
lacks everything. If they say to you, once of you come, okay,

88
00:05:15.241 --> 00:05:18.450
forget the 10 year old hot dog here. Then we have come from the light.

89
00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:22.830
We have sayings of Jesus which have not been seen,

90
00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:27.120
read or even heard about for almost 2000 years.

91
00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:32.350
<v 2>A long list of sayings that are not in the canonical books of the Bible.</v>

92
00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:37.780
<v 0>He who seeks let him not cease seeking until he find this is a different Jesus</v>

93
00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:43.940
than the why in the Bible. It's almost eastern in tone. He says,

94
00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:48.560
heaven is here. The Kingdom of the father is spread out upon the earth.

95
00:05:48.561 --> 00:05:53.480
It's all around us and men do not see it. If we just opened our eyes,

96
00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:57.680
<v 2>it's a preposterous that today's known as the log fragment</v>

97
00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:01.630
<v 0>there was buried in the trash. Wow. Anyhow,</v>

98
00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:04.280
the team pulled as much paper as they could from the mounds,

99
00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:07.820
separated out all the shoes and stuff and just took the paper and then they pack

100
00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:12.510
<v 2>those up into hundreds of boxes and ship them back to here to Oxford.</v>

101
00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:19.430
This is the Sacrad library in Oxford and we're still today 107 years later.

102
00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:25.830
We're going upstairs. We're still today opening those boxes,

103
00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:28.740
pulling out the fragments,

104
00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:32.940
piecing them back together and decipher in them.

105
00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:40.320
<v 0>This is what 2000 year old papers sounds like</v>

106
00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:44.740
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

107
00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:47.920
<v 0>sounds just like paper and it looks like dried leaves.</v>

108
00:06:47.921 --> 00:06:49.990
Not really much to look at or listen to,

109
00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:54.400
but knowing that it's 2000 years old and theoretically could have been written

110
00:06:54.401 --> 00:06:58.270
on by Jesus himself, that makes it a little more special.

111
00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:00.730
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

112
00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:05.710
<v 0>which is why we visited Oxford England where the dump now lives packed away and</v>

113
00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:08.500
700 boxes of books.

114
00:07:08.501 --> 00:07:13.060
I can tell you about 600 and published with clarity. Nick Ganis,

115
00:07:13.061 --> 00:07:16.060
one of the collections curators popped one open for us.

116
00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:19.160
<v 3>I'm just opening.</v>

117
00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:23.480
I know official document sometime early the fourth century.

118
00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:28.621
<v 0>Of course,</v>

119
00:07:28.621 --> 00:07:33.540
it's full of holes probably caused by little worms and there's the sad part.

120
00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:38.010
There are enough secrets in these boxes to rewrite the past.

121
00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:42.360
The problem is much of this is very hopelessly fragmented.

122
00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:44.850
Reading it is almost impossible.

123
00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:47.010
<v 3>All the fragments, if you see lots of them,</v>

124
00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:50.740
they'd look like and conglomeration of conflicts.

125
00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:58.290
There will be a few hundred years before even the most substantial of these

126
00:07:58.291 --> 00:08:00.750
fragments come to light.

127
00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:05.640
<v 2>We're talking about the reconstruction of, of works that the work on,</v>

128
00:08:05.641 --> 00:08:08.430
which is beyond the scale of a single human lifetime,

129
00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:13.020
<v 0>way beyond in the past 107 years.</v>

130
00:08:13.021 --> 00:08:18.021
The Oxford team has to work their way through a whopping 1% of the collection.

131
00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:22.620
They may take another 10 centuries to get through the rest.

132
00:08:24.570 --> 00:08:29.040
Here's how it usually goes. Nick scours the boxes each day finds a new scrap,

133
00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:32.370
tiny little scrap, brings it into the lab for cleaning.

134
00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:37.710
<v 3>What I do now is remove some Anson mud with the help of a brash</v>

135
00:08:43.290 --> 00:08:46.950
<v 0>here. He wipes ancient mud from a torn page of Homer's Iliad</v>

136
00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:53.670
after it's mud for each piece is cataloged in the computer for various features

137
00:08:53.671 --> 00:08:56.430
like type of hand write in size

138
00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:57.050
<v 2>and style</v>

139
00:08:57.050 --> 00:08:59.150
<v 0>and if the piece seems to match the other pieces,</v>

140
00:08:59.151 --> 00:09:03.440
Dirk and maybe a Grad student spread them all out on a long wooden table and

141
00:09:03.441 --> 00:09:05.750
basically from there it's a classic jigsaw.

142
00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:09.930
<v 2>How about this when just met with click, these might be the wine beginnings of,</v>

143
00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:11.520
I think there's one here.

144
00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:15.120
I think that that looks like it's promising that to see if the words match up

145
00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:20.330
cause they seem to line up pretty exactly with the lines of the verge of

146
00:09:20.941 --> 00:09:21.710
fragment.

147
00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:25.540
<v 0>May take five minutes, it may take five years.</v>

148
00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:28.420
We take five lifetimes, but eventually they will have,

149
00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:33.420
well not the whole story, not even a page or the whole story.

150
00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:35.893
<v 3>Something</v>

151
00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:41.360
I've put the parties on to an electronic microscope.

152
00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:46.390
Maybe just a few Greek words from the deep past host site, punk.

153
00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:50.820
Probably a criterion that the Moose on that whole day and contact about 10

154
00:09:57.830 --> 00:09:58.680
[inaudible] guys.

155
00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:00.640
<v 2>Uh,</v>

156
00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:05.640
but we miss them a bit from the upper right corner.

157
00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:10.860
Sometimes a sentence breaks off just when you need it to tell you what you need

158
00:10:11.021 --> 00:10:15.250
to know. We have to be satisfied with knowing of little rather than a lot.

159
00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:16.650
<v 0>Make sure I understand this. Is,</v>

160
00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:21.740
is each of these fragments just a teeny for like is it a to B or it's more like

161
00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:27.770
to, what was that smell? Some of them are tiny, tiny.

162
00:10:27.771 --> 00:10:29.690
I mean there was about a half a million in total,

163
00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:34.460
half a million and a and they've only got through about 5,000. What is it,

164
00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:37.900
do you have in your own list of things like a, a sort of fever hits list? I do,

165
00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:41.340
I do. I've narrowed it down to, uh, to my top three. Okay.

166
00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:46.280
My top three ancient garbage greatest hits, if you will, which is difficult,

167
00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:50.240
but here's three that are really interesting. First number three,

168
00:10:50.270 --> 00:10:54.230
ancient garbage, greatest hits. Number three, you being a death metal fan,

169
00:10:54.231 --> 00:10:58.250
I'm sure are familiar with these three in auspicious number

170
00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:11.000
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

171
00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.790
<v 0>absolutely. Six six, six side of the beast. Right.</v>

172
00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:15.560
Just to explain that the number of the beast,

173
00:11:15.561 --> 00:11:20.561
six 66 is what you use to either some of the beast or to keep the beast away

174
00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:24.300
because he can't say his name directly. That would be bad. Yeah.

175
00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:26.270
All this comes from the New Testament. Okay.

176
00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:31.420
Derek showed me a piece of a virus that he found in the dump, um,

177
00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:34.010
about the size of your palm. So what are we looking at?

178
00:11:34.011 --> 00:11:37.500
This looks like there's maybe 30 letters, a copy.

179
00:11:37.501 --> 00:11:42.140
You have to have precisely that passage in the new testament where the number is

180
00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:43.263
stated

181
00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:48.530
<v 2>that hit them. Who had thought understanding, reckon the number of the beast</v>

182
00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:50.700
<v 0>for it is a human number.</v>

183
00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:55.450
It's number is hundred and 66 six,

184
00:11:55.451 --> 00:11:59.350
six six which was the traditional number of the bees. Here's the thing,

185
00:11:59.351 --> 00:12:01.000
this little scrap of the pirates,

186
00:12:01.001 --> 00:12:05.740
the Dirk turned up is the earliest known copy that we have of that passage.

187
00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:08.620
He showed me, can we, can you, can you point to the letters again and,

188
00:12:08.621 --> 00:12:10.180
and show me what this three numbers are.

189
00:12:10.181 --> 00:12:12.550
Smack in the center of the pope virus clutters,

190
00:12:12.551 --> 00:12:15.730
Chi Sigma Chi, Yoda,

191
00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.020
Sigma Chi Yoda Sigma should say six six, six, right? Yup.

192
00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:25.240
But in fact, Chi, Yoda, sigma, don't say six six, six they don't,

193
00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:31.210
what do they say? Six six one six

194
00:12:32.950 --> 00:12:36.400
no, sort of six six, six. Really? Yeah.

195
00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:39.370
Does that mean all the bibles are wrong or maybe, I mean,

196
00:12:39.371 --> 00:12:44.371
all we really know is that the number of the beast had versions and at six one,

197
00:12:46.251 --> 00:12:49.410
six, maybe the original. Wow.

198
00:12:50.050 --> 00:12:53.230
How long does it take this to filter into the King James Bible or something like

199
00:12:53.231 --> 00:12:57.190
that? It will appear in the next standard edition of the New Testament.

200
00:12:57.220 --> 00:13:02.220
In a note on that page representing as a viable variant that has now appeared in

201
00:13:02.231 --> 00:13:03.064
a proposed Turks.

202
00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:08.640
What does the do biblical scholars except this did they do? Oh, so we all it.

203
00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:12.630
You should just probably be very careful about six blank six from it.

204
00:13:12.690 --> 00:13:13.960
If you weren't worrying about the beast,

205
00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:16.480
well you should probably change your tattoo

206
00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:25.840
shit. All right, let's move on to number two. Garbage.

207
00:13:25.841 --> 00:13:29.640
Greatest hits. Number two, aids. You see the movie tray? Yes.

208
00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:30.633
Do you remember the scene?

209
00:13:30.950 --> 00:13:31.783
<v 4>Good.</v>

210
00:13:33.370 --> 00:13:36.790
<v 0>Big, bold, muscular men fighting big, bold,</v>

211
00:13:36.791 --> 00:13:39.950
muscular fights with big bowls and muscular enemies. Huh?

212
00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:41.370
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

213
00:13:41.370 --> 00:13:44.270
<v 0>I know the film and I know how big, bold and muscular.</v>

214
00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:46.283
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

215
00:13:47.210 --> 00:13:50.330
<v 0>What did your scrap tell you? Well, they've been very folks recently.</v>

216
00:13:50.331 --> 00:13:53.210
This is big news in the, in the world of the pup biologist,

217
00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:55.670
they got their hands on this special camera.

218
00:13:55.870 --> 00:13:59.650
So we have this digital set up here, a camera on a uh,

219
00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:01.400
on a sort of easel.

220
00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:05.060
This camera uses infrared filters to photograph text.

221
00:14:05.061 --> 00:14:09.500
It's so faded that you can't really see it with the naked eye. Take a

222
00:14:11.210 --> 00:14:13.760
quite a long exposure. In any case,

223
00:14:13.761 --> 00:14:18.710
the first thing that they read with that camera is a poem about the Trojan War.

224
00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:23.390
The new poem of our killer Co's. This poem, [inaudible]F r base,

225
00:14:23.391 --> 00:14:27.720
a pollution straight on Hoyt or [inaudible] comes from the six hundreds,

226
00:14:27.770 --> 00:14:29.800
not homer, it's our silicosis Virginia.

227
00:14:29.810 --> 00:14:32.930
It's precisely not homer because whereas the Homeric version,

228
00:14:32.931 --> 00:14:37.910
the Brad Pitt version, it goes, uh, you know, Greece invade, Troy falls, hurrah.

229
00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:43.970
This version goes Greeks invade, get their butts kicked,

230
00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:48.080
then run, run like sissies

231
00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:52.040
quickly turns to account on

232
00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:52.740
<v 2>its head.</v>

233
00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:53.760
<v 0>Wait, wait, wait. It was, so this guy,</v>

234
00:14:53.790 --> 00:14:56.520
this was written at the same time as homely, a little bit later,

235
00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:59.070
but in response to homer, oh

236
00:14:59.510 --> 00:15:01.400
<v 2>and the great goes like this here,</v>

237
00:15:01.950 --> 00:15:06.860
listen day to tell you crowd one doesn't have to call it weakness and cowardice

238
00:15:06.950 --> 00:15:09.020
having to retreat out at trip.

239
00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:12.260
So there does exist a proper time for flight.

240
00:15:12.730 --> 00:15:16.720
<v 0>C Homer's notion was that like the hero stands and fights to the end, but,</v>

241
00:15:16.810 --> 00:15:20.320
but this poet was saying, you know what? No, we ran away,

242
00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:23.200
turned our backs to flee quickly and that's okay.

243
00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:27.900
<v 2>He actually celebrated it as something that he was proud of because sometimes</v>

244
00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:29.460
you had to turn and run.

245
00:15:32.590 --> 00:15:32.730
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

246
00:15:32.730 --> 00:15:36.120
<v 0>running away is a good thing. Running away is a good thing. That's a good one.</v>

247
00:15:36.210 --> 00:15:36.451
See,

248
00:15:36.451 --> 00:15:41.451
what's interesting about the past you find in the trash is that it's messy.

249
00:15:42.690 --> 00:15:45.030
It's complicated. There's not just a story.

250
00:15:45.031 --> 00:15:49.500
You know there's contradictions to that story. Competing accounts of that story,

251
00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:52.050
which can be disconcerting. I mean,

252
00:15:52.110 --> 00:15:55.400
you know who wants to have different bibles floating around.

253
00:15:55.410 --> 00:15:59.850
That can be weird for people, but to me to know that way back when,

254
00:15:59.851 --> 00:16:03.690
even then there were different ideas about what it means to be a hero

255
00:16:05.310 --> 00:16:06.143
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

256
00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:07.640
<v 0>that I find comforting,</v>

257
00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:16.530
which brings us to my first choice. Last but hardly least ancient garbage.

258
00:16:16.531 --> 00:16:19.800
Greatest hit number. Well, the greatest hit.

259
00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:22.620
What do you think people in the first century were reading?

260
00:16:22.770 --> 00:16:23.940
What do I think they were reading?

261
00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:27.980
What do you think they were really reading?

262
00:16:28.290 --> 00:16:33.000
<v 2>Okay. When the, when the text starts, she's saying, Oh, I'm terribly on fire,</v>

263
00:16:33.001 --> 00:16:37.950
and that goes in Greek day. No s flag of my realm.

264
00:16:37.951 --> 00:16:42.720
A May a K D aw. Say the translation.

265
00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:46.710
Oh, it's thick and big as a roof

266
00:16:50.070 --> 00:16:53.760
<v 0>and then she goes on a how to make her hard. That's what they were reading.</v>

267
00:16:53.790 --> 00:16:58.320
This filthy satire turned up enough times in this and other dumps for Dirk to

268
00:16:58.321 --> 00:17:00.930
suspect that it may have been a bestseller.

269
00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:05.640
So there was more than one version of this. It appeared over and over and over.

270
00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:08.700
<v 2>I'm burning, I'm on fire. I'm terribly on fire.</v>

271
00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:12.090
A stream runs over me. Do you understand?

272
00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:16.660
<v 0>And I'm being a bit [inaudible].</v>

273
00:17:17.610 --> 00:17:18.970
You are listening to radio

274
00:17:22.330 --> 00:17:24.340
from New York public radio,

275
00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:26.850
<v 2>the U and why</v>

276
00:17:27.690 --> 00:17:29.960
<v 0>and NPR, right? What?</v>

277
00:17:33.010 --> 00:17:33.300
Keep listening.
