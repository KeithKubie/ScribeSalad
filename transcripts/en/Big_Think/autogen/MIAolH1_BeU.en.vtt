would say determinants that were

would say determinants that were
 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.850
would say determinants that were
determinable so some are like race in

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860
determinable so some are like race in
 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.390

fluently black at the same time so in

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230
fluently black at the same time so in

I'm at a meeting of the American
Philosophical Association my my identity

Philosophical Association my my identity
 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:17.840
Philosophical Association my my identity
is a philosopher is kind of important

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850
is a philosopher is kind of important
 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:24.320

but if I go to a meeting church group it

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330
but if I go to a meeting church group it
 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.560
but if I go to a meeting church group it
probably isn't and so I know I know

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570
probably isn't and so I know I know
 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.440

without thinking about it often what the

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450
without thinking about it often what the

without thinking about it often what the
relevance is of different dimensions of

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040
relevance is of different dimensions of
 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.749
relevance is of different dimensions of
my identity so when people are get into

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759
my identity so when people are get into
 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:36.980
my identity so when people are get into
trouble with us it's because they think

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990
trouble with us it's because they think
 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.929
trouble with us it's because they think
that one dimension of identity makes a

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939
that one dimension of identity makes a
 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.149
that one dimension of identity makes a
demand on them that's inconsistent with

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159
demand on them that's inconsistent with
 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.219
demand on them that's inconsistent with
the demand made by some other dimension

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229
the demand made by some other dimension
 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.720
the demand made by some other dimension
of their identity

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:44.730
of their identity
 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:54.950
of their identity
I think there are sort of two helpful

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960
I think there are sort of two helpful
 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.340
I think there are sort of two helpful
guiding thoughts one is morality is

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350
guiding thoughts one is morality is
 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.740
guiding thoughts one is morality is
helpful here that's to say there are

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750
helpful here that's to say there are
 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.780
helpful here that's to say there are
general obligations we have to other

people independent of their identities
 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:06.470
people independent of their identities
and our identities we better make sure

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:06.480
and our identities we better make sure
 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.170
and our identities we better make sure
that we discharge those first of all so

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:09.180
that we discharge those first of all so
 

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:10.940
that we discharge those first of all so
if you find yourself being pulled in

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950
if you find yourself being pulled in
 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.470
if you find yourself being pulled in
two-dimensional directions by your

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480
two-dimensional directions by your
 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.850
two-dimensional directions by your
identities if you find yourself being

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860
identities if you find yourself being
 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.160
identities if you find yourself being
pulled in the one direction say as a

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170
pulled in the one direction say as a
 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.950
pulled in the one direction say as a
Serb and in the other direction as a

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960
Serb and in the other direction as a
 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.480
Serb and in the other direction as a
Christian it might be helpful to

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490
Christian it might be helpful to
 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.730
Christian it might be helpful to
remember that you're a human being and

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740
remember that you're a human being and
 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.350
remember that you're a human being and
that you have obligations to other

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360
that you have obligations to other
 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.600
that you have obligations to other
people that are not connected with

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610
people that are not connected with
 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.280
people that are not connected with
whether you're being you're a Serb or a

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290
whether you're being you're a Serb or a
 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.890
whether you're being you're a Serb or a
Christian so that's one thing morality

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900
Christian so that's one thing morality
 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.290
Christian so that's one thing morality
helps morality which which defines what

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300
helps morality which which defines what
 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.420
helps morality which which defines what
we owe to everybody irrespective of

we owe to everybody irrespective of
their identities the second thing is

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890
their identities the second thing is
 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.070
their identities the second thing is
that sometimes we do have to make

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080
that sometimes we do have to make
 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.590
that sometimes we do have to make
choices that's part of what it is to

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600
choices that's part of what it is to
 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.710
choices that's part of what it is to
make a human life its - it's the way in
