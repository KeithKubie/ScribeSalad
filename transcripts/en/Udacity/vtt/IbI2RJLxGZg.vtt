00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.350
Saying that a kitten is to cat what a
puppy is to a dog is a semantic analogy.

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:09.420
Just like saying that shorter is
to short what taller is to tall

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.090
is a syntactic analogy.

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:14.530
Here's a fun emergent properties
of those embedding factors.

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:19.130
They let you express analogies like this
in terms of mathematical operations.

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:20.630
If you have a good model, and

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.380
you take the vector for puppy,
subtract the vector for

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:28.480
dog and then add back the vector for
cat, then you get another vector.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.490
If you look for what that vector
is closest to in imbedding space,

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:34.270
chances are that it will be kitten.
