MICHELLE WILLIAMS:
Welcome to The Forum,

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:09.730
livestreamed worldwide
from the Leadership Studio

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:12.790
at the Harvard T.H. Chan
School of Public Health.

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:14.980
I'm Dean Michelle Williams.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.340
The Forum is a collaboration
between the Harvard Chan School

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:20.620
and independent news media.

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:23.590
Each program features
a panel of experts

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:27.430
addressing some of today's most
pressing public health issues.

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:29.980
The Forum is one way
the school advances

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.740
the frontiers of
public health and makes

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:37.660
scientific insights accessible
to policymakers and the public.

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.270
I hope you find this program
engaging and informative.

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.954
Thank you for joining us.

00:00:43.954 --> 00:00:47.370

00:00:59.415 --> 00:01:00.790
MARGOT SANGER-KATZ:
Hi, everyone.

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:01.990
My name is Margot Sanger-Katz.

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:03.740
I'm a correspondent
at the New York Times,

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:05.349
and I'm your moderator today.

00:01:05.349 --> 00:01:07.000
I want to introduce our panel.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.600
To my immediate
right is Bob Blendon,

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.040
who's a professor
of health policy

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.980
and political analysis at
the Harvard T.H. Chan School

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:16.830
of Public Health and the
Harvard Kennedy School.

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.830
Next is Eric Schneider,
who's the senior vice

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.480
president for
policy and research

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.280
at the Commonwealth Fund.

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.400
Bob Master, who's the
founder and former president

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.850
and chief executive officer of
the Commonwealth Care Alliance.

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.940
And joining us remotely
is Toyin Ajayi,

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.360
who is the chief health officer
and a co-founder of CityBlock,

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.300
and I know also a Boston alum.

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.960
So this event is being
presented in collaboration

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.780
with the Commonwealth Fund,
and we are streaming live

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.990
on The Forum, on
Facebook and on YouTube.

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.170
We are going to have a
brief Q&amp;A at the end,

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.970
and so those of you
in the audience,

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.120
prepare good questions.

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.360
But those of you who
are watching remotely

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.692
can also email your questions
to theforum@hsph.harvard.edu.

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.980
And you can also
participate in a live chat

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.770
that's happening on The
Forum's website right now.

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.620
So to come to our topic
today, if we really

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.117
want to understand how the
health care system is working,

00:02:16.117 --> 00:02:17.700
I think it makes a
lot of sense to see

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.500
how it's working for the
people who really need it.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.440
And I was surprised when
we began this project

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:23.970
to learn that there
has never been

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.840
a major survey of the seriously
ill people who use the health

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.650
care system the most.

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.200
So this year, with
the Commonwealth Fund

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.480
and the Harvard School of Public
Health, we surveyed nearly 14--

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.030
sorry, we surveyed
1,495 people who

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.430
had real health problems,
multiple hospitalizations

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.790
and doctor's visits, and often
many other needs besides.

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.645
And some of what we found
was pretty disappointing.

00:02:47.645 --> 00:02:49.020
Patients said they
were receiving

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:52.200
care that was confusing,
conflicting, dispiriting,

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.840
and included medical errors.

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.487
They also reported substantial
financial distress,

00:02:57.487 --> 00:02:59.070
despite health
insurance coverage that

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:00.586
was supposed to protect them.

00:03:00.586 --> 00:03:03.210
So we're going to take a closer
look at the poll results today.

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:05.940
We'll also talk about some
of the less obvious costs

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.640
of serious illness, costs
that don't necessarily

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.702
appear on medical bills but
still make it hard for people.

00:03:11.702 --> 00:03:13.660
And we want talk about
some possible solutions,

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.384
so it won't all
be doom and gloom,

00:03:15.384 --> 00:03:17.550
including programs that our
panelists are working on

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:19.510
to try to address these issues.

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.846
So first, let's watch a
clip from the US Department

00:03:21.846 --> 00:03:23.220
of Health and
Human Services that

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.950
brings home the financial
impact of serious illness.

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:29.660
RICHARD KNIGHT: I
am Richard Knight

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:31.540
of New Carrollton, Maryland.

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.590
Life before I was
diagnosed was very good.

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:35.960
I was running my own business.

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:38.620
I was president of a
Boys and Girls Club.

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.900
1996, I went to get
some life insurance.

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:48.080
I had the blood work, urine
test, and I was rejected.

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:53.010
And as it turned out, I had
impending kidney failure.

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:58.324
My kidneys continued to
deteriorate until 2004,

00:03:58.324 --> 00:03:59.615
when they shut down completely.

00:03:59.615 --> 00:04:02.090
I went to the emergency room.

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:03.580
I began dialysis.

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:08.020
I was 51, 2006, when
I had my transplant.

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:09.670
I had an amazing recovery.

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:11.920
I was taking immunity
suppressant medication

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.970
that was fairly expensive.

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:16.209
I am looking at a couple
hundred dollars a month

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:18.260
copay, even with Medicare.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.490
And first I have to pay for
the deductible every year.

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:24.010
I probably won't retire,
and one of the reasons

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:26.540
is because of the cost
of the medications

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:29.170
that I will constantly
have to pay for.

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:32.320
The fact that the government
is looking at the cost of drugs

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.890
is a plus.

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:35.030
I'm very encouraged by that.

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:36.880
SPEAKER 1: American
Patients First.

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.520
hhs.gov/drugpricing.

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.550
Produced by the US Department
of Health and Human Services

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:45.494
at taxpayer expense.

00:04:45.494 --> 00:04:46.910
MARGOT SANGER-KATZ:
So we just saw

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:48.670
the story of this
one patient who

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:51.320
is facing a lot of
financial obstacles

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.470
even though he got this
amazing organ transplant that

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:55.700
changed his life.

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:57.380
Bob, I know we had
a lot of questions

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:00.046
and a lot of answers in the poll
about people facing these kinds

00:05:00.046 --> 00:05:01.070
of financial stresses.

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:03.747
Can you talk a little bit
about what the results were?

00:05:03.747 --> 00:05:05.330
BOB BLENDON: So we'll
do this quickly,

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:10.080
but the biggest finding is,
for 50 years in this country,

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:14.480
we've been debating how to
help people who aren't insured.

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.420
And the assumption is,
once you get them the card,

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:19.790
they are protected for
the rest of their lives.

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:21.830
And we're going to
take you in a world

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:23.850
where serious little
people with insurance,

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:26.780
including Medicare, are
facing staggering bills.

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:28.640
It has nothing to do
with the dialogue we've

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:30.050
been having for 50 years.

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:32.000
You cross the Rubicon.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.930
Now, you're safe.

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:35.780
So let's just do
this very quickly.

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:38.960
First it buried in
every story about--

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:43.480
first slide-- health
care in America

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:45.800
is one in six people
who are extraordinarily

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.760
ill over a three-year period.

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.990
And so the people in
our sample, 100% of them

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:52.760
were hospitalized
at least twice,

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:56.000
said they had a serious illness.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.250
A quarter of them were
hospitalized five times

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:00.080
in three years.

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.850
They were mostly seeing
five doctors or more.

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:05.800
So you talk about
information coordination.

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:08.450
They are taking five or
more prescription drugs.

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:12.590
And just to show, as we'll show
in a minute, insured America,

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:18.350
one in 10 had $50,000 a year of
prescription medication bills.

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:21.497
And these are people
who, in fact, say

00:06:21.497 --> 00:06:24.080
they're seriously ill, and they
have one of the major killers.

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:27.020
So these are not
routine patients at all.

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:30.500
Let's just take a
look at what happens.

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:31.770
Next slide.

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:35.960
So the gray bars are all 91%
of people-- good news-- had

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:37.170
a health insurance policy.

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:40.200
Wow, I can feel good about that.

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:41.460
So here it is.

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:43.230
I have a health
insurance policy.

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:46.490
53% of people with a
health insurance policy

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:47.930
had serious medical bills.

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:49.910
They had problems paying it.

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:52.130
And so a third were hospital.

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:53.270
But I'm insured.

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:56.220
Third, prescription
drugs, emergency rooms.

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:58.370
These are not stories
about the uninsured.

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:01.260
These are stories of people
who have an insurance card.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.950
All through our poll,
each section we ask you,

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:05.430
what worries you most?

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:07.444
Mostly, I don't know
how I can pay for this.

00:07:07.444 --> 00:07:09.860
Suddenly, they're being told
that this policy that they're

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:12.930
lying in a bed with is
not going to do that.

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:14.790
Next slide, please.

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:17.270
So take quickly.

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:21.230
So if you just look at the
gray bars, I have insurance.

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:23.300
My family feels reassured.

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:28.850
36% of the insured people
used up all their savings

00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:30.380
as a result of having this.

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:32.170
They had insurance.

00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:38.900
21% couldn't pay for basic
necessities, having insurance,

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:40.890
and lost the job.

00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:43.850
And we'll get back to this
in a minute, most people who

00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:46.850
work in America have
short-term sick benefits.

00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:47.500
Guess what?

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:50.060
If I'm not sick over
these periods of time,

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:51.830
my benefits run out.

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:54.530
And my job sends
me a loving note

00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:58.650
about you may not be able
to continue for this.

00:07:58.650 --> 00:07:59.690
So we have that.

00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:02.430
And the last slide,
very quickly.

00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:05.390
So all of us have
stories that may

00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:08.450
have played that role, where a
friend or family member, when

00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:12.140
you go home from the hospital,
takes care of you for a while.

00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:14.930
But these are people
who have long a whiles.

00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:17.390
So this is the
financial experience

00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:19.280
of the person who
cared for you at home.

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:20.570
Not you, them.

00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:23.360
So one in four of
those people had

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:25.910
significant financial
problems because they

00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:29.630
had to cut back on the rest of
their lives, and 21% of them

00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:32.270
just said I had to care
for someone at home,

00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:35.100
I have a lower income
as a result of that.

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:37.429
So just the two
takeaways from here.

00:08:37.429 --> 00:08:40.580
Now that we're moving away
from the uninsured debate,

00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:43.760
there's a serious problem if
you're seriously ill about

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:45.770
whether or not your
insurance will cover you.

00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:48.710
Secondly, sick days,
which at Harvard

00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:51.110
may be terrific for as
long as you want to be out,

00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:53.580
are not that good
for other people.

00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:56.210
And if you have a
long-term illness,

00:08:56.210 --> 00:08:58.100
you start running
out of your sick days

00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:00.410
and you have an
inability of keeping

00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:02.700
your financial viability.

00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:03.200
Eric?

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:03.860
ERIC SCHNEIDER: Great.

00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:04.190
Thank you.

00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:05.170
And I'll take the next slide.

00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:07.160
BOB BLENDON: It's not
exactly great, but it's.

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:08.076
ERIC SCHNEIDER: Well--

00:09:08.076 --> 00:09:10.290
MARGOT SANGER-KATZ: So tell
us, aside from finances,

00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:12.160
like how's the care that
this population is getting?

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:13.580
ERIC SCHNEIDER: --yeah, so
I want to turn to that now.

00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:15.930
But first I want to say
it's great to be back here.

00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:19.160
I've taught at the school and
done research here since 1997,

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:21.260
and joined the Commonwealth
Fund four years ago.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.090
It's exciting to be
working with Bob again,

00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:25.690
and to see so many colleagues
and friends in the audience.

00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:28.760
What I want to turn to
next on the next slide is

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:30.736
this issue that really
dates back to my arrival

00:09:30.736 --> 00:09:32.360
at the Harvard School
of Public Health,

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:35.560
which was the Institute of
Medicine began to publish

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:39.030
a series of three reports--

00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:44.140
To Err is Human, about safety,
Crossing the Quality Chasm,

00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:46.930
about the quality
of care, and Report

00:09:46.930 --> 00:09:50.020
on Disparities, racial and
ethnic disparities in care.

00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:54.340
And that's 20 years ago now,
and what our survey has revealed

00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:56.380
is that, for this
population, we've

00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:59.050
actually made remarkably
little progress

00:09:59.050 --> 00:10:00.880
in tackling some of
the problems that

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:03.010
were outlined in those reports.

00:10:03.010 --> 00:10:07.360
The other thing I wanted to
mention here is that about 56%

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:12.790
of this group has emotional
problems, anxiety,

00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:16.720
or depression attributable
to their illness.

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:19.090
And people who may not
have started out that way

00:10:19.090 --> 00:10:21.520
often fall into a
sort of vicious circle

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:24.400
on that front, as
well as the financial.

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:29.320
So the next-- sorry, this slide
shows that about 61% of people

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:33.040
in this population experience
one or more problems that we

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:36.040
identify, that actually were
identified by the original

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:38.370
Institute of Medicine
report as problems--

00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:43.240
poor care coordination, a lack
of clarity about services,

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:45.640
and a lack of
responsiveness of staff

00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:48.440
to the needs of those people.

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:50.830
And you can see that
those range-- you know,

00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:53.890
it's one in five
or one in four who

00:10:53.890 --> 00:10:55.810
are experiencing each
of those, or reporting

00:10:55.810 --> 00:10:58.220
each of those issues.

00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:02.740
The other issue that comes up
on this slide is patient safety.

00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:05.260
23% of the people
in this survey are

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:08.510
reporting that they experienced
serious medical errors.

00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:10.210
That's a high rate.

00:11:10.210 --> 00:11:13.750
Not entirely unexpected because
it's a complex population,

00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:15.655
but we have to probably
do better on that.

00:11:15.655 --> 00:11:18.640
So I'll take the next slide.

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:23.650
I'm just going to sort of pivot
to the solution side of this,

00:11:23.650 --> 00:11:26.110
and give a little frame in
terms of our conclusions

00:11:26.110 --> 00:11:27.550
about what's needed here.

00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:29.110
And this is really
based on the needs

00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:32.410
that patients
experienced and reported.

00:11:32.410 --> 00:11:34.870
Up until the last 20
years, many people

00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:38.320
have focused more on the
delivery system side.

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:40.990
And as I just said, the
delivery system side

00:11:40.990 --> 00:11:42.950
is not doing what
it needs to do.

00:11:42.950 --> 00:11:46.120
But this survey was an
attempt to actually report

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:47.770
on the user needs,
the experience

00:11:47.770 --> 00:11:50.390
of these vulnerable populations.

00:11:50.390 --> 00:11:55.510
So the first strategy, area of
strategies, that we identified

00:11:55.510 --> 00:11:58.690
is the issue of building
behavioral health capacity

00:11:58.690 --> 00:12:01.720
to manage behavioral
health needs of this really

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:03.860
challenged population.

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:07.390
The second is the issue
of assessing and then

00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:10.120
addressing the social
needs that people

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:13.940
have-- housing, transportation,
nutritional needs.

00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:18.340
Those are unmet in many in
our survey, for many people.

00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:20.350
The third is to
make coordination

00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:23.470
of care a priority.

00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:25.120
People talk about
care coordination.

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:26.745
There have been a
lot of federal effort

00:12:26.745 --> 00:12:29.080
to try to bring about care
coordination in the system.

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:31.370
But there really is
still a high level

00:12:31.370 --> 00:12:34.300
of reporting that the
care is not coordinated,

00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:36.430
and that primary
care in particular

00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:40.760
is not able to solve this
problem yet for most people.

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:43.120
And then the fourth
is the issue of making

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:46.390
care more affordable to avoid
the sort of vicious cycle

00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:48.590
that Bob pointed out.

00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:51.254
So with that, I'm going to
turn it over to Bob Master.

00:12:51.254 --> 00:12:52.170
BOB MASTER: Thank you.

00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:57.310
So what I think I
can talk about is

00:12:57.310 --> 00:13:00.550
what about all of
these issues in people

00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:01.780
with additional challenges?

00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:04.450
Low income challenges,
what we now

00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:07.180
call social determinants
of health challenges,

00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:11.770
and people who in fact probably
have the best insurance

00:13:11.770 --> 00:13:15.580
you can have when you put
Medicare and Medicaid together.

00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:18.350
You don't have the
financial issues,

00:13:18.350 --> 00:13:20.620
but you have a care
delivery system

00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:25.780
that is hopelessly
in need of redesign

00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:28.400
to more effectively
provide care.

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:30.700
So what are the
clinical characteristics

00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:32.530
of this population?

00:13:32.530 --> 00:13:36.550
And it's heterogeneous, but
clearly, as we talked about,

00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:40.540
you have one or more
significant chronic illnesses

00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:43.332
that have very low thresholds
to hospitalization.

00:13:43.332 --> 00:13:45.040
And we'll come back
to the hospital part,

00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:48.550
because that's a part
of the downward spiral.

00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:50.500
You have very high
prevalence of people

00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:55.270
that have long-term service
and support needs, that are not

00:13:55.270 --> 00:13:57.940
fully independent and
may be fully dependent

00:13:57.940 --> 00:13:59.367
and everything
along the spectrum.

00:13:59.367 --> 00:14:01.450
And whether that's a frail
elder or whether that's

00:14:01.450 --> 00:14:03.940
a younger person,
or even a child

00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:07.930
or adolescent with significant
disabilities, that adds to it.

00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:10.840
As Eric said, behavioral
health prevalence

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:14.950
is extraordinarily high,
and integration is just

00:14:14.950 --> 00:14:16.990
the beginning.

00:14:16.990 --> 00:14:20.530
What is really
needed, and if we're

00:14:20.530 --> 00:14:23.230
going to prevent
that downward spiral

00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:26.410
of recurrent
hospitalizations, 95%

00:14:26.410 --> 00:14:29.660
through the emergency room
because of the low thresholds,

00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:32.925
and each of the spiral
leads to more transitions--

00:14:32.925 --> 00:14:35.250
it's in the transitions
where you have

00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:39.060
the problems and the errors--

00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:42.930
you're going to need an
absolute redesign of what

00:14:42.930 --> 00:14:46.800
is done in addition to
the need for coordination.

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:50.190
It isn't coordinating
all the pieces here,

00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:52.680
we have to change what is
happening in those pieces.

00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:54.169
And we can talk
about that later.

00:14:54.169 --> 00:14:56.460
MARGOT SANGER-KATZ: Toyin,
I know you guys at CityBlock

00:14:56.460 --> 00:14:58.410
are treating this
population who are

00:14:58.410 --> 00:14:59.861
facing both these
medical and some

00:14:59.861 --> 00:15:01.110
of these financial challenges.

00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:02.610
Can you just talk
to us a little bit

00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:04.235
about how it looks
close to the ground?

00:15:04.235 --> 00:15:04.984
TOYIN AJAYI: Sure.

00:15:04.984 --> 00:15:06.450
And first just to
commend you all,

00:15:06.450 --> 00:15:07.950
thank you so much
for this research.

00:15:07.950 --> 00:15:12.000
It's just so important
to start to quantify

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.900
how significant these financial
barriers can be for people

00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:17.070
with serious illness.

00:15:17.070 --> 00:15:19.470
It gives voice and
data to what we

00:15:19.470 --> 00:15:21.340
see in our clinical practice.

00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:23.970
And I think the
key things to note

00:15:23.970 --> 00:15:25.890
in real life, the
population that we're

00:15:25.890 --> 00:15:29.700
serving is that this manifests
both in the financial burden

00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:33.600
that you articulated, but also
in a whole host of continually

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:35.820
hidden costs, cost
to the patient

00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:38.100
and to the family
that are essentially

00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:40.150
invisible to the
health care system.

00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:42.660
And so when I see my
patients in practice,

00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:44.760
not only do we ask
about and do we

00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:48.390
see the financial costs of care
in the form of particularly

00:15:48.390 --> 00:15:51.270
pharmaceutical costs, but
also have to pay attention

00:15:51.270 --> 00:15:53.370
to the opportunity costs.

00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:55.620
And so when you're talking
about a population of folks

00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:59.280
like the folks who we
serve, who have insurance--

00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:01.620
and by and large,
as Bob described,

00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:03.810
this is probably the best
insurance you can get.

00:16:03.810 --> 00:16:07.600
It's Medicaid, or it's
Medicare, or it's both.

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:09.900
These are folks, though,
for whom their time is one

00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:11.890
of the most valuable assets.

00:16:11.890 --> 00:16:16.770
And what we don't capture
yet is the opportunity cost

00:16:16.770 --> 00:16:18.840
of being seriously ill.

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:21.792
So you're asking people
to take time off work.

00:16:21.792 --> 00:16:24.000
If they're working, that's
cash out of their pockets.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.375
If they're an
hourly wage worker,

00:16:25.375 --> 00:16:26.550
it's pretty significant.

00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:28.560
We're asking people to
pay for transportation

00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:30.510
to get to the appointment.

00:16:30.510 --> 00:16:34.200
We're asking people to pay for
child care while they're sick

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:36.960
or while they're accessing
additional services.

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:40.260
That recurrent cycle continues
to exacerbate the costs

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:41.820
in that household.

00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:45.630
Additionally, as some folks have
already started to describe,

00:16:45.630 --> 00:16:48.600
the barriers to addressing
all of the other needs

00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:50.910
a person has in their
home and in their life

00:16:50.910 --> 00:16:54.229
in order to access effective
medical care can be huge.

00:16:54.229 --> 00:16:56.520
If you're trying to make a
decision between whether you

00:16:56.520 --> 00:17:00.960
pay $400 for a copay for your
insulin or if you're behind

00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:04.310
on all of your other bills--
your rent, your utility bills--

00:17:04.310 --> 00:17:07.230
it's understandable why
people make rational decisions

00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:09.060
not to access health care.

00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:11.970
And yet to the providers
in the health care system,

00:17:11.970 --> 00:17:16.170
we know that often asking
people about financial burdens

00:17:16.170 --> 00:17:18.540
in their lives is taboo.

00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:21.060
We feel like our job is to
provide the best medical care

00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:22.560
and the best medical
recommendations

00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:24.210
regardless of our
ability to pay,

00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:26.220
and regardless of
people's incomes.

00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:29.640
So recognizing that your
financial status plays

00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:31.800
a role in health and
well-being is something

00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:34.000
that doctors typically
aren't trained to do,

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.208
and it's something that the
health care system is not

00:17:36.208 --> 00:17:37.110
oriented to do.

00:17:37.110 --> 00:17:39.860
We find that, in our population,
not asking those questions

00:17:39.860 --> 00:17:41.732
should be tantamount
to medical malpractice,

00:17:41.732 --> 00:17:44.190
because if you're asking someone
to do something that means

00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:46.740
they don't feed their children
or clothe their children,

00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:49.110
or asking them to make
choices and take time out

00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:50.940
of their day in ways
that disadvantage

00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:54.210
them in other parts of their
lives, we are doing them harm.

00:17:54.210 --> 00:17:56.982
And we need to be really
cognizant of that, as well.

00:17:56.982 --> 00:17:58.440
MARGOT SANGER-KATZ:
So in a moment,

00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:00.420
I want to talk more
about solutions

00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:02.190
to try to improve
some of these problems

00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:04.110
that we have
identified, but first I

00:18:04.110 --> 00:18:07.500
want another video clip
about a program that

00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:09.750
is trying to do that, called
the Guided Care program.

00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:12.790
And this clip comes from
the Commonwealth Fund.

00:18:12.790 --> 00:18:14.910
SPEAKER 2: When we have
a doctor's appointment,

00:18:14.910 --> 00:18:16.530
she'll go there with us.

00:18:16.530 --> 00:18:20.550
And she'll sit there and listen
to what the doctor has to say.

00:18:20.550 --> 00:18:22.660
SPEAKER 3: It's been
wonderful having her.

00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:26.072
Gives me a sense of security.

00:18:26.072 --> 00:18:27.780
SPEAKER 4: I think
the biggest challenges

00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:30.300
they face medically
is just trying

00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:32.790
to be as healthy as they
can within their limiting

00:18:32.790 --> 00:18:34.020
conditions.

00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:35.790
As a guided care
nurse, what I try to do

00:18:35.790 --> 00:18:39.060
is give them ways to
feel more confident,

00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:41.950
and to have them do their own
health care or their own med

00:18:41.950 --> 00:18:43.860
setup, but then double
check to give them

00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:45.985
that comfort that they know
they're doing it right.

00:18:45.985 --> 00:18:49.380
Part of my role is seeing
them in their homes,

00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:51.370
going to office
visits with them,

00:18:51.370 --> 00:18:52.745
doing telephone
calls in between.

00:18:52.745 --> 00:18:54.150
Yeah, hi, this is Patti.

00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:57.367
I'm just calling to see how your
medication is working for you.

00:18:57.367 --> 00:18:58.950
We found that guided
care really helps

00:18:58.950 --> 00:19:00.930
in those transitional
areas, because that

00:19:00.930 --> 00:19:03.440
tends to be when patients
will fall through the cracks.

00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:06.340
If the patient is hospitalized,
I see them at the hospital.

00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:09.270
If they're discharged to the
nursing home, I go there.

00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:12.410
My biggest role is to guide
them through wherever they are,

00:19:12.410 --> 00:19:15.600
be it at home, at the
office, at the hospital,

00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:18.690
and make sure that their
care is transitioned

00:19:18.690 --> 00:19:19.892
and there's no errors made.

00:19:19.892 --> 00:19:21.600
MARGOT SANGER-KATZ:
So Eric, I'm curious,

00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:24.016
you obviously know the most
about this particular program.

00:19:24.016 --> 00:19:25.680
And I'm wondering
whether you think

00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:27.510
this program or other
programs like it

00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:29.130
can start to make a dent
in some of the problems

00:19:29.130 --> 00:19:30.150
that we've just
been talking about.

00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:31.025
ERIC SCHNEIDER: Yeah.

00:19:31.025 --> 00:19:34.810
I would love to get Bob and
Toyin's opinion on this, too,

00:19:34.810 --> 00:19:37.470
but it really does
illustrate the need

00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:40.680
to move care into the home-based
setting, into the community,

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:41.800
as much as possible.

00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:44.590
We really haven't pushed the
envelope in terms of that.

00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:48.180
And I think I just want to
reiterate Bob's point that--

00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:49.524
this Bob--

00:19:49.524 --> 00:19:50.448
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:50.448 --> 00:19:53.154
MARGOT SANGER-KATZ: I
know, we're surrounded.

00:19:53.154 --> 00:19:55.320
ERIC SCHNEIDER: --that it's
not enough to coordinate

00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:57.640
the existing building
blocks of the system.

00:19:57.640 --> 00:20:00.090
We really actually need
to innovate and redesign

00:20:00.090 --> 00:20:03.360
the care to deliver
it in the home

00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:06.960
to address a lot of the other
issues that one can see.

00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:08.520
I've done home
visits, one can see

00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:12.280
these issues that will never
come up in a clinic setting.

00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:16.310
And so I think that's
really important.

00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:17.310
BOB MASTER: I can start.

00:20:17.310 --> 00:20:19.050
By the way, I
think after working

00:20:19.050 --> 00:20:21.316
with Toyin for
over six years, we

00:20:21.316 --> 00:20:22.815
can complete each
other's sentences.

00:20:22.815 --> 00:20:23.640
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:28.510
And maybe we should do this
as a team without question.

00:20:28.510 --> 00:20:31.960
But if we just look at
those building blocks--

00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:34.140
first of all, what are
the redesign elements?

00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:37.050
And I really do want to start
with the extraordinary work

00:20:37.050 --> 00:20:40.350
that was really done
as part of the ACA

00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:45.090
to really try to scale a
systems of care and change

00:20:45.090 --> 00:20:50.850
that really was neglected
for decades ever

00:20:50.850 --> 00:20:55.220
since the onset of
Medicare and Medicaid.

00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:57.540
And that was the beginning
of global payments

00:20:57.540 --> 00:21:01.140
where a clinical organization
with the appropriate risk

00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:04.410
adjustment could have complete
responsibility over all

00:21:04.410 --> 00:21:07.320
of the benefits and services
of medical care, hospital

00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:09.510
care, pharmacy,
and long-term care

00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:11.100
that you could
bring to a person.

00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:13.770
And that allows you
to re-imagine care.

00:21:13.770 --> 00:21:17.040
So fee for service,
piecemeal care

00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:20.760
where a physician in an office
is seeing people in 15 minute

00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:22.450
visits don't work.

00:21:22.450 --> 00:21:25.830
And the next thing that
is really required in that

00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:27.910
is to re-imagine primary care.

00:21:27.910 --> 00:21:32.490
And that would be not just a
doctor in an office, and not

00:21:32.490 --> 00:21:35.490
just 3% to 4% of the
total medical spend

00:21:35.490 --> 00:21:37.710
going to primary
care, but in fact,

00:21:37.710 --> 00:21:40.770
an interdisciplinary team
that may look different

00:21:40.770 --> 00:21:42.210
for different populations.

00:21:42.210 --> 00:21:44.610
And that would be the doctor,
the nurse practitioner

00:21:44.610 --> 00:21:46.470
for people with
physical disabilities,

00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:49.770
integrated physical therapy
and occupational therapy,

00:21:49.770 --> 00:21:53.190
and durable medical equipment
for the integrated behavioral

00:21:53.190 --> 00:21:55.590
health to reiterate
the importance of that

00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:57.150
in practices.

00:21:57.150 --> 00:22:00.510
And you're now then
talking about 10% to 12%

00:22:00.510 --> 00:22:04.860
of the pie that has
to go to primary care.

00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:07.960
And until we resource
that correctly,

00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:10.170
and until we move to global
payment arrangements,

00:22:10.170 --> 00:22:12.660
you're not going to
be able to do that.

00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:16.230
You then have to build
what we call elasticity

00:22:16.230 --> 00:22:18.030
into the system in primary care.

00:22:21.510 --> 00:22:23.910
Toyin and I go to
work in the morning.

00:22:23.910 --> 00:22:27.120
Most physicians are booked
from 8:00 in the morning

00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:29.610
until who knows
when in the evening.

00:22:29.610 --> 00:22:32.940
And yet, if you have
people with low thresholds

00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:35.866
to problems that
are going to occur,

00:22:35.866 --> 00:22:38.340
how do they receive that care?

00:22:38.340 --> 00:22:41.340
In the United States today, it's
the ambulance and the emergency

00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:42.670
room.

00:22:42.670 --> 00:22:44.520
So thinking about elasticity.

00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:46.530
If you have a
frail elder at home

00:22:46.530 --> 00:22:48.210
or a person with
disabilities, you've

00:22:48.210 --> 00:22:50.010
got to get that
assessment and you've

00:22:50.010 --> 00:22:52.410
got to move it into the home.

00:22:52.410 --> 00:22:55.320
In fact, for people with
physical disabilities

00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:58.680
who rely on the
publicly funded ride,

00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:00.510
they can't get to
a doctor's office

00:23:00.510 --> 00:23:03.360
immediately because you
got to have a 24 to 48

00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:06.030
hour appointment
window to do that.

00:23:06.030 --> 00:23:11.770
So it's now primary care as
a service and not a building.

00:23:11.770 --> 00:23:16.500
And seeing people as needed
and not by appointment.

00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:19.920
And then comes the
second and third stage.

00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:22.840
How do we then move into
what we call the primary care

00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:26.880
whitespace, which is
what happens after hours

00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:29.070
when somebody is sick
and a physician takes

00:23:29.070 --> 00:23:32.070
that call at midnight,
and you can't figure out

00:23:32.070 --> 00:23:33.900
whether this can
take two aspirins

00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:37.140
and we'll see you tomorrow
or you're really sick,

00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:39.120
we got to get you in now.

00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:40.830
Most of it falls in
the middle where you

00:23:40.830 --> 00:23:42.040
don't know what's happening.

00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:45.360
And by default, this
frail elder or a person

00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:49.930
with risk for hospitalizations
goes to the emergency room.

00:23:49.930 --> 00:23:52.740
What do you do there in
terms of system change?

00:23:52.740 --> 00:23:59.250
And there is some interesting
work with advanced life support

00:23:59.250 --> 00:24:02.220
clinicians that can do
this kind of response

00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:05.010
as part of a primary care team.

00:24:05.010 --> 00:24:06.510
And the last-- and
I'll stop here--

00:24:06.510 --> 00:24:10.020
is the redesign of how you care
for people in the hospital.

00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:13.920
In one sentence, you're moving
primary care and continuity

00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:16.740
into the hospital.

00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:21.460
And so when a person needs it,
they've got their teams there.

00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:22.960
And I'll stop.

00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:25.342
MARGOT SANGER-KATZ: So Toyin,
I see a lot of nodding.

00:24:25.342 --> 00:24:26.550
TOYIN AJAYI: So much nodding.

00:24:26.550 --> 00:24:28.538
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:28.538 --> 00:24:30.390
MARGOT SANGER-KATZ:
I'm curious, as you

00:24:30.390 --> 00:24:33.280
think about these opportunities
for improving coordination

00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:34.960
for this population
that's really sick.

00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:36.520
People have a lot
of illnesses who

00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:40.540
have been hospitalized a lot,
who have lot of medical needs.

00:24:40.540 --> 00:24:43.780
Are the strategies--
do they carry over

00:24:43.780 --> 00:24:45.910
to those of us who
are normally healthy,

00:24:45.910 --> 00:24:48.190
but maybe have a crisis
every once in a while?

00:24:48.190 --> 00:24:49.930
Or does it feel like
a unique problem

00:24:49.930 --> 00:24:51.694
that needs a unique
set of situations?

00:24:51.694 --> 00:24:53.860
I'm just wondering how much
is this a good metaphor?

00:24:53.860 --> 00:24:55.210
If we figured out how
to solve these people,

00:24:55.210 --> 00:24:56.890
then we're going to
translate it over here.

00:24:56.890 --> 00:24:59.014
How much of it is, OK,
let's just do one thing here

00:24:59.014 --> 00:24:59.927
and one thing there.

00:24:59.927 --> 00:25:02.010
TOYIN AJAYI: I think it's
a really great question.

00:25:02.010 --> 00:25:05.260
So the way that
we have typically

00:25:05.260 --> 00:25:08.260
used innovation in
health care in particular

00:25:08.260 --> 00:25:11.157
has been that we've
solved for the healthy.

00:25:11.157 --> 00:25:13.240
If you think about the
typical primary care model,

00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:16.150
for example, it works
great if you're in your 20s

00:25:16.150 --> 00:25:18.114
and you don't have a
lot of medical needs,

00:25:18.114 --> 00:25:19.780
and you can afford
to take time off work

00:25:19.780 --> 00:25:21.863
to go see a primary care
doctor, and you can wait,

00:25:21.863 --> 00:25:23.950
and you can come back,
and pay the copay,

00:25:23.950 --> 00:25:25.617
and get your once
a year physical.

00:25:25.617 --> 00:25:26.200
It works fine.

00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:27.310
It's not perfect.

00:25:27.310 --> 00:25:29.070
It could be better,
but it works fine.

00:25:29.070 --> 00:25:30.970
And the innovation
in primary care

00:25:30.970 --> 00:25:34.420
largely has been to try to
make that interaction more

00:25:34.420 --> 00:25:36.850
seamless for people who
are relatively healthy

00:25:36.850 --> 00:25:39.130
and have resources.

00:25:39.130 --> 00:25:39.880
That doesn't work.

00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:42.504
It's not going to trickle
down to people who are sick.

00:25:42.504 --> 00:25:44.170
It's not going to
trickle down to people

00:25:44.170 --> 00:25:46.030
with complex needs
for all of the reasons

00:25:46.030 --> 00:25:48.730
that Bob described when
you talk about the 24/7

00:25:48.730 --> 00:25:53.170
nature of their need for access
to high quality health care.

00:25:53.170 --> 00:25:57.940
That said, however, any single
one of us who is healthy today

00:25:57.940 --> 00:26:03.430
is, as we know, a unfortunate
accident, a catastrophe,

00:26:03.430 --> 00:26:06.920
an undiagnosed cancer
away from being sick.

00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:08.950
And the data from
this study shows

00:26:08.950 --> 00:26:11.440
that if that happens, no
matter where you start,

00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:14.380
if you're insured or not,
the risk that that pushes you

00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:16.620
into poverty is so great.

00:26:16.620 --> 00:26:20.110
So suddenly, we have
a frame in which

00:26:20.110 --> 00:26:22.450
the safety net system that
we're building actually

00:26:22.450 --> 00:26:23.590
may serve any one of us.

00:26:23.590 --> 00:26:26.530
Any person in this country
who is going to age

00:26:26.530 --> 00:26:29.860
and be sick over time,
which as the population ages

00:26:29.860 --> 00:26:33.190
and as we start to prevent more
and more diseases until later

00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:35.410
into our adulthood, is
going to be most of us.

00:26:35.410 --> 00:26:37.570
As we got into our 60s
and 70s, the likelihood

00:26:37.570 --> 00:26:40.540
that we're living with chronic
conditions is incredibly high.

00:26:40.540 --> 00:26:42.040
And the likelihood
that one of those

00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:45.100
makes us have to seek hospital
care and expensive drug

00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:48.770
treatments that push us into
poverty is also quite high.

00:26:48.770 --> 00:26:51.460
But when we build solutions,
we have to build intensely

00:26:51.460 --> 00:26:53.650
for that population.

00:26:53.650 --> 00:26:56.200
And the lessons will
trickle up, if you will,

00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:59.550
to people who are less sick
who need less of the services.

00:26:59.550 --> 00:27:01.475
They may require
fewer of the tools

00:27:01.475 --> 00:27:05.460
in the toolkit in a much
less frequent fashion.

00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:07.600
But we need to have
them there because it

00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:08.600
could be any one of us.

00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:12.280
And so when we think about
really focusing innovation,

00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:14.290
putting together
the best teams we

00:27:14.290 --> 00:27:17.500
can around technology, around
operational design, logistics,

00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:22.826
24/7 access to care, [INAUDIBLE]
in service of this use case.

00:27:22.826 --> 00:27:24.850
Our hypothesis,
though, is that as we

00:27:24.850 --> 00:27:26.890
start to push those
tools out, they

00:27:26.890 --> 00:27:30.130
will become in service of folks
who are less needed today,

00:27:30.130 --> 00:27:32.625
but over time they
become high risk.

00:27:32.625 --> 00:27:34.000
MARGOT SANGER-KATZ:
I just wanted

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.790
to make sure that we
circled back to Bob's slides

00:27:36.790 --> 00:27:38.410
about some of the
financial stresses

00:27:38.410 --> 00:27:41.890
that people face because those
really did stick out to me.

00:27:41.890 --> 00:27:44.800
And I feel they connect to a
growing body of research that

00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:48.010
shows that not only
are we seeing more

00:27:48.010 --> 00:27:51.070
people with insurance that has
high cost sharing that exposes

00:27:51.070 --> 00:27:53.800
them to a lot of out-of-pocket
costs even if they are insured,

00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:55.780
but also growing
evidence that being sick

00:27:55.780 --> 00:27:59.146
has other financial consequences
for people because if you can't

00:27:59.146 --> 00:28:00.770
work-- even if you
don't lose your job,

00:28:00.770 --> 00:28:02.170
if you have to take time
off, you have to cut back

00:28:02.170 --> 00:28:04.294
on your hours, if you have
disability that makes it

00:28:04.294 --> 00:28:05.710
hard to do the
same kind of work,

00:28:05.710 --> 00:28:09.970
that losing income can be an
additional financial challenge

00:28:09.970 --> 00:28:11.350
associated with being sick.

00:28:11.350 --> 00:28:13.900
And so I'm just wondering
how should we think

00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:17.140
about this group of problems?

00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:19.066
Is health insurance good enough?

00:28:19.066 --> 00:28:20.440
What can we do to
make it better?

00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:24.460
Do we need other kinds of wrap
around insurance for people

00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:27.250
so that when they get sick they
don't get pushed into poverty

00:28:27.250 --> 00:28:28.390
as Toyin described?

00:28:28.390 --> 00:28:29.190
ROBERT BLENDON: So I'm
going to surprise you.

00:28:29.190 --> 00:28:30.981
I'm not going to say
it's all very complex.

00:28:30.981 --> 00:28:31.870
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:31.870 --> 00:28:35.740
So first, all you have to do
is turn on the TV, and look,

00:28:35.740 --> 00:28:37.750
we're now in the Medicare
enrollment choice.

00:28:37.750 --> 00:28:41.434
And it says, pick the Medicare
wrap around that you need.

00:28:41.434 --> 00:28:42.850
The first thing
out of this survey

00:28:42.850 --> 00:28:47.740
is very few people knew three
years ahead that they would

00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:51.280
have five hospitalizations,
$50,000 of drug bills,

00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:52.570
five doctors.

00:28:52.570 --> 00:28:53.710
They had no idea.

00:28:53.710 --> 00:28:56.380
And we're telling
them to choose a plan.

00:28:56.380 --> 00:28:58.090
Now how can I be
insured and have

00:28:58.090 --> 00:29:00.340
$50,000 of prescription drugs?

00:29:00.340 --> 00:29:01.270
That's easy.

00:29:01.270 --> 00:29:02.830
I bought a drug benefit.

00:29:02.830 --> 00:29:06.190
Except somebody gave me a
drug for cancer or something,

00:29:06.190 --> 00:29:08.980
and that little drug
benefit won't do that.

00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:11.650
And so we're having a
debate for the under 65.

00:29:11.650 --> 00:29:13.654
Let's choose the plan you need.

00:29:13.654 --> 00:29:15.820
There's no reason that you
should have requirements.

00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:17.140
Same thing happened.

00:29:17.140 --> 00:29:18.940
A young adult
choosing has no idea

00:29:18.940 --> 00:29:21.290
they're getting hit by a
car or have a heart attack.

00:29:21.290 --> 00:29:22.300
And so they don't know.

00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:25.390
So what do we need simply is not
what it appears on television.

00:29:25.390 --> 00:29:29.470
Get yourself a counselor to read
the 47 pages of the Medicare

00:29:29.470 --> 00:29:30.310
alternatives.

00:29:30.310 --> 00:29:34.025
No, there has to be a federal
or state agency that certifies.

00:29:34.025 --> 00:29:34.525
Very simple.

00:29:34.525 --> 00:29:35.740
A little star.

00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:37.930
If you buy this plan,
it will cover you

00:29:37.930 --> 00:29:39.550
for your catastrophic illnesses.

00:29:39.550 --> 00:29:41.970
You don't have to read
the other 47 pages.

00:29:41.970 --> 00:29:43.720
And it probably is
going to have to extend

00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:45.100
coverage that isn't there.

00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:48.640
You should not require
people to have to figure out,

00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:50.816
will my cancer be a type one?

00:29:50.816 --> 00:29:52.690
And that will be covered
fully by the policy,

00:29:52.690 --> 00:29:54.400
but a type two isn't fully.

00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:55.820
You're not going to know that.

00:29:55.820 --> 00:29:58.840
So a nice little star
says, don't worry,

00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:00.760
when the ambulance
comes and you're there,

00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:02.470
you have a policy
that will cover it.

00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:03.760
We have no certification.

00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:08.830
Likewise, we need a catastrophic
something for work-related days

00:30:08.830 --> 00:30:09.970
off benefits.

00:30:09.970 --> 00:30:12.340
At some point, it kicks back in.

00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:16.270
And if you really are caring for
somebody needs a lot of care,

00:30:16.270 --> 00:30:19.390
your job has some
protection that after 14

00:30:19.390 --> 00:30:21.430
days of sick days,
they don't fire you.

00:30:21.430 --> 00:30:25.120
And it has to be a requirement
where it kicks in way down.

00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:27.910
But those two things,
an easy certification.

00:30:27.910 --> 00:30:29.980
But please, the
people we surveyed

00:30:29.980 --> 00:30:34.060
could not read a 37
page choice document.

00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:37.390
And that ad which says
we'll get you a reaper

00:30:37.390 --> 00:30:39.900
and we'll work your way
through, that's exactly what

00:30:39.900 --> 00:30:41.170
is not needed.

00:30:41.170 --> 00:30:44.080
What's needed is a
simple certification that

00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:45.910
says, if this happens to you--

00:30:45.910 --> 00:30:49.090
and by the way, if we told you
we were giving a drug benefit,

00:30:49.090 --> 00:30:52.390
the company can't say I'm not
going to pay for this drug.

00:30:52.390 --> 00:30:53.744
It's just not fair to people.

00:30:53.744 --> 00:30:55.660
They have no way of
knowing that they're going

00:30:55.660 --> 00:30:56.951
to have to have a prescription.

00:30:56.951 --> 00:31:00.310
So this is simple, but
I'm a tenured professor.

00:31:00.310 --> 00:31:00.810
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:00.810 --> 00:31:03.143
MARGOT SANGER-KATZ: That
sounds like an expensive system

00:31:03.143 --> 00:31:04.159
what you're describing.

00:31:04.159 --> 00:31:06.700
ROBERT BLENDON: That's why he
does costs and I do protection.

00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:07.895
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:07.895 --> 00:31:09.270
MARGOT SANGER-KATZ:
Do any of you

00:31:09.270 --> 00:31:10.420
other guys have
thoughts about that?

00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:11.637
About this cost problem?

00:31:11.637 --> 00:31:13.720
ROBERT MASTER: Very briefly,
I have to respond now

00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:17.260
that I am a Medicare
beneficiary myself

00:31:17.260 --> 00:31:18.490
and having gone through this.

00:31:18.490 --> 00:31:21.010
And I think I know
more about this world

00:31:21.010 --> 00:31:23.920
than most people having
lived it for decades.

00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:25.720
I won't say how many.

00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:27.580
And this policy decade.

00:31:27.580 --> 00:31:30.550
And it was opaque.

00:31:30.550 --> 00:31:35.760
Absolutely opaque in saying
which drug plan do you pick?

00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:41.270
Which wrap around
Medigap do you pick?

00:31:41.270 --> 00:31:44.860
And I'm saying, oh, my god,
if it's that opaque for me,

00:31:44.860 --> 00:31:46.810
how is it for
people that are not

00:31:46.810 --> 00:31:48.271
in health care in this world?

00:31:48.271 --> 00:31:50.770
MARGOT SANGER-KATZ: I would say
that's the most common email

00:31:50.770 --> 00:31:53.540
that I get from
colleagues or friends.

00:31:53.540 --> 00:31:57.169
Can you help me select
between these options?

00:31:57.169 --> 00:31:58.960
TOYIN AJAYI: If I could
just add one thing.

00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:02.170
This is the quintessential
of market failure, right?

00:32:02.170 --> 00:32:05.686
There is such a lack of
information available to people

00:32:05.686 --> 00:32:07.420
that are making these choices.

00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:09.670
And I think what just
adds insult to injury

00:32:09.670 --> 00:32:11.110
is that this data is available.

00:32:11.110 --> 00:32:14.230
And actually, it's
being used, I would

00:32:14.230 --> 00:32:15.980
argue, not for good
by other agents,

00:32:15.980 --> 00:32:17.230
but in the health care system.

00:32:17.230 --> 00:32:20.830
So you think that health
insurance plans can

00:32:20.830 --> 00:32:23.200
tell by your purchasing
patterns, your demographics,

00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:25.900
and where you live
the likelihood of you

00:32:25.900 --> 00:32:28.270
becoming seriously ill
in the next five years.

00:32:28.270 --> 00:32:30.550
And they do use this to
try to figure out where

00:32:30.550 --> 00:32:31.954
they should market their plans.

00:32:31.954 --> 00:32:34.120
They want to the healthiest
people on their Medicare

00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:36.160
Advantage plans.

00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:39.820
Large retail stores
know exactly when

00:32:39.820 --> 00:32:43.060
you are likely to have a
need for x or y product.

00:32:43.060 --> 00:32:46.990
And that's when miraculously
the ad shows up on your iPhone

00:32:46.990 --> 00:32:50.230
or the flyer comes
through your mailbox.

00:32:50.230 --> 00:32:52.900
We have the data to
help people better

00:32:52.900 --> 00:32:55.990
understand what their risks
are and what the likelihood

00:32:55.990 --> 00:32:58.750
that they're going to
need catastrophic coverage

00:32:58.750 --> 00:33:01.310
and how they should be
prioritizing their resources.

00:33:01.310 --> 00:33:03.190
So even just giving
more transparency

00:33:03.190 --> 00:33:05.730
to that information, some
guiding, some coaching.

00:33:05.730 --> 00:33:08.209
And then I love the idea
of certifying plans.

00:33:08.209 --> 00:33:10.000
That when you know
you're buying something,

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.130
you know what you
can expect from it.

00:33:12.130 --> 00:33:14.530
It's such a fundamental
thing I think

00:33:14.530 --> 00:33:17.590
we can do to help people, in
addition to all of the work

00:33:17.590 --> 00:33:20.500
that we need to do to put
pressure on on the broader

00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:23.200
systems to really ask
what coverage you need

00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:26.290
and what our commitment
to ensuring that when

00:33:26.290 --> 00:33:28.240
we say people have
insurance that they really

00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:29.410
have insurance.

00:33:29.410 --> 00:33:32.800
It feels like there's almost a
nomenclature gap here as well

00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:35.380
because we're not seeing
quite the same thing when

00:33:35.380 --> 00:33:36.867
we say you have
coverage and then

00:33:36.867 --> 00:33:38.950
we find out that actually
your out-of-pocket costs

00:33:38.950 --> 00:33:40.735
are through the roof
and you had no idea.

00:33:40.735 --> 00:33:42.485
ERIC SCHNEIDER: Yeah,
just to put a number

00:33:42.485 --> 00:33:44.680
on this, the Commonwealth
Fund survey which

00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:49.210
tracks the adequacy
of health insurance--

00:33:49.210 --> 00:33:50.740
the under-insured
rate, people who

00:33:50.740 --> 00:33:54.640
really are facing unmanageable
costs in any given year

00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:58.660
has gone up to nearly half the
general population, let alone

00:33:58.660 --> 00:34:00.911
this very vulnerable population.

00:34:00.911 --> 00:34:02.410
The other thing I
just wanted to say

00:34:02.410 --> 00:34:05.860
is that we've been now 20
years into a cycle of consumer

00:34:05.860 --> 00:34:09.434
information and transparency
that would somehow allow people

00:34:09.434 --> 00:34:11.350
to make good choices and
create the incentives

00:34:11.350 --> 00:34:12.760
for organizations.

00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:15.489
And many people are starting
to conclude that that's not

00:34:15.489 --> 00:34:18.280
a successful strategy, or
at least not sufficient

00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:20.449
to solve some of these problems.

00:34:20.449 --> 00:34:22.929
So what we have now is
people with insurance

00:34:22.929 --> 00:34:26.440
facing high deductibles,
facing ruinous costs.

00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:28.179
And that's colliding
with a system that

00:34:28.179 --> 00:34:31.449
has consolidated where costs
are escalating dramatically

00:34:31.449 --> 00:34:33.969
where the prices are
really out of control

00:34:33.969 --> 00:34:36.440
because there's no
counter negotiating power.

00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:39.780
And from a policy level, that's
a really important issue.

00:34:39.780 --> 00:34:42.040
If people can work
on that, we would

00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:44.985
be delighted to talk
to you after this.

00:34:44.985 --> 00:34:46.360
MARGOT SANGER-KATZ:
So we're just

00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:47.710
about at the time for questions.

00:34:47.710 --> 00:34:49.780
So I'm going to
start with a question

00:34:49.780 --> 00:34:52.580
that we received through
our email system.

00:34:52.580 --> 00:34:54.100
But all of you
guys, you're next.

00:34:54.100 --> 00:34:55.929
So get ready.

00:34:55.929 --> 00:34:57.520
And this is a question
that gets back

00:34:57.520 --> 00:34:59.269
to the caregiver issue,
which I was hoping

00:34:59.269 --> 00:35:01.030
we were going to touch on.

00:35:01.030 --> 00:35:02.950
What can we do in
terms of policy change

00:35:02.950 --> 00:35:05.050
to help caregivers,
like family and friends,

00:35:05.050 --> 00:35:07.390
manage the stress and
responsibility of helping

00:35:07.390 --> 00:35:09.460
ill patients once they get home?

00:35:09.460 --> 00:35:10.930
So many patients
need support when

00:35:10.930 --> 00:35:13.138
they return from the hospital,
and workplace policies

00:35:13.138 --> 00:35:15.580
in particular make it
difficult for family and others

00:35:15.580 --> 00:35:16.630
to provide coverage.

00:35:16.630 --> 00:35:19.240
So there was a
lot of information

00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:22.330
in this survey about caregivers,
about the financial stresses

00:35:22.330 --> 00:35:23.710
that we saw in Bob's slide.

00:35:23.710 --> 00:35:26.230
But also just how hard it
is emotionally for them

00:35:26.230 --> 00:35:28.850
and how much work it is to
care for their relatives.

00:35:28.850 --> 00:35:30.970
And so I'm curious what
thoughts you guys have

00:35:30.970 --> 00:35:34.359
about that, about what we could
do better for those people.

00:35:34.359 --> 00:35:35.650
ERIC SCHNEIDER: I'll just say--

00:35:35.650 --> 00:35:38.230
I meant to say this earlier
that the Commonwealth

00:35:38.230 --> 00:35:40.400
Fund has teamed with
five other foundations.

00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:42.520
The Robert Wood Johnson
Foundation, the Peterson

00:35:42.520 --> 00:35:45.010
Foundation, the SCAN
foundation, Hartford Foundation,

00:35:45.010 --> 00:35:49.600
and Millbank Foundation to
create a digital resource,

00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:52.390
which you saw a clip from,
called the Better Care

00:35:52.390 --> 00:35:53.320
Playbook.

00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:58.330
And the purpose of that
is to really feature

00:35:58.330 --> 00:36:00.040
evidence-based
interventions that

00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:03.130
could be helpful to
people with complex needs.

00:36:03.130 --> 00:36:05.620
And caregiver support comes
up over and over again.

00:36:05.620 --> 00:36:07.840
And we saw that
in the clip there.

00:36:10.594 --> 00:36:12.010
ROBERT MASTER:
Again, some lessons

00:36:12.010 --> 00:36:14.440
from the Medicaid world.

00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:18.280
Medicaid really was our
nation's first long-term care

00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:21.250
and disability insurer
for support care.

00:36:21.250 --> 00:36:25.816
And maybe it is the
only comprehensive one.

00:36:25.816 --> 00:36:27.610
One of the most
important supports

00:36:27.610 --> 00:36:29.260
was personal care assistance.

00:36:29.260 --> 00:36:31.090
Self-directed personal
care assistance,

00:36:31.090 --> 00:36:33.070
which was a unique
Medicaid benefit that

00:36:33.070 --> 00:36:38.020
grew up over decades, and,
at in least in the more

00:36:38.020 --> 00:36:42.280
recent iterations that Toyin
and I have been involved in,

00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:44.020
was the opportunity
to essentially

00:36:44.020 --> 00:36:47.020
have family members, whether
it's a spouse, whether it's

00:36:47.020 --> 00:36:51.610
a daughter, son, granddaughter,
grandson, nephew, neighbor,

00:36:51.610 --> 00:36:56.500
friend, be that
caregiver and reimbursed.

00:36:56.500 --> 00:36:59.000
And you say, well,
how can you do that?

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:01.150
Well, in some ways, how
can you not do that?

00:37:01.150 --> 00:37:05.920
Because the cost of having
some reasonable reimbursement

00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:09.640
for that kind of support
is the alternative

00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:13.000
to a skilled nursing
facility in many cases.

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:15.370
Or worse, for many
frail elders, more

00:37:15.370 --> 00:37:18.640
of a long-term nursing facility
at several hundred dollars

00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:20.230
a day.

00:37:20.230 --> 00:37:24.980
And so are the lessons
from the Medicaid world?

00:37:24.980 --> 00:37:27.490
And historically,
Medicaid was always

00:37:27.490 --> 00:37:32.225
viewed as the marginalized
twin to Medicare.

00:37:32.225 --> 00:37:36.660
But in fact, has been this
engine of policy innovation.

00:37:36.660 --> 00:37:37.950
And that's a good example.

00:37:37.950 --> 00:37:41.970
And is that applicable to
the more broad and general

00:37:41.970 --> 00:37:42.910
population?

00:37:42.910 --> 00:37:43.590
MARGOT SANGER-KATZ:
So what would the idea

00:37:43.590 --> 00:37:45.720
be that your health insurance
benefits should include

00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:47.636
some stipend for someone
who takes care of you

00:37:47.636 --> 00:37:50.497
if you have a really
serious problem?

00:37:50.497 --> 00:37:52.580
ROBERT MASTER: And you
don't have a Medicaid card?

00:37:52.580 --> 00:37:52.860
MARGOT SANGER-KATZ: Right.

00:37:52.860 --> 00:37:54.910
ROBERT MASTER: Yeah, possibly.

00:37:54.910 --> 00:37:56.355
And it may be very
cost effective

00:37:56.355 --> 00:37:59.470
in the investment in that.

00:37:59.470 --> 00:38:00.986
Absolutely.

00:38:00.986 --> 00:38:02.610
MARGOT SANGER-KATZ:
Any other thoughts?

00:38:02.610 --> 00:38:04.276
TOYIN AJAYI: The other
thing I would add

00:38:04.276 --> 00:38:06.546
is-- and it's not quite
responsive to the question

00:38:06.546 --> 00:38:07.920
because it's not
as much a policy

00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:10.290
lever as it is a
care model lever is

00:38:10.290 --> 00:38:12.030
thinking about social care.

00:38:12.030 --> 00:38:15.120
And so we at City
Block really focus

00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:17.209
on going beyond
screening and referral

00:38:17.209 --> 00:38:18.750
for social determinants,
but thinking

00:38:18.750 --> 00:38:22.440
about social components of
care as a whole thick piece

00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:23.820
of the puzzle.

00:38:23.820 --> 00:38:28.500
And that means asking both who
do you depend on for supports?

00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:30.660
Physical practical,
tangible supports as well as

00:38:30.660 --> 00:38:32.130
emotional supports.

00:38:32.130 --> 00:38:34.110
And also, who depends on you?

00:38:34.110 --> 00:38:35.850
And recognizing
that every person

00:38:35.850 --> 00:38:40.110
is part of a complex ecosystem
of relationships that sometimes

00:38:40.110 --> 00:38:42.810
make them dependent on
another and other times

00:38:42.810 --> 00:38:46.020
allow them to be the
support person for others.

00:38:46.020 --> 00:38:47.850
If we ask those
questions as a matter

00:38:47.850 --> 00:38:50.880
of routine in all of our
health care interactions

00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:54.750
everywhere in the system,
than it necessarily behooves

00:38:54.750 --> 00:38:56.080
us try to act on those.

00:38:56.080 --> 00:38:58.260
And so when you think
about people going home

00:38:58.260 --> 00:39:01.440
from the hospital, if it was
the business of the health care

00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:05.940
system to know that your
daughter is the person who

00:39:05.940 --> 00:39:08.820
really supports you in
getting dressed every morning

00:39:08.820 --> 00:39:12.100
and that she's just taken a new
job out of town or something,

00:39:12.100 --> 00:39:14.400
then we're able to start to
think about what it looks

00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:16.620
like for your discharge
home and what other supports

00:39:16.620 --> 00:39:18.120
we would need to put in place.

00:39:18.120 --> 00:39:21.420
Versus the converse,
recognizing that if we

00:39:21.420 --> 00:39:24.840
have patients, individuals
who are also carers,

00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:25.840
because we can be both.

00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:28.950
We can be seriously ill,
dependent on others,

00:39:28.950 --> 00:39:30.420
and also carers for others.

00:39:30.420 --> 00:39:32.820
The impact on the whole
ecosystem around you

00:39:32.820 --> 00:39:34.410
can be profound.

00:39:34.410 --> 00:39:36.690
So what we're
finding in particular

00:39:36.690 --> 00:39:40.980
when we think about cost is that
interventions on social care

00:39:40.980 --> 00:39:45.240
are cheaper in general
and accrue returns

00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:48.630
across a larger number of people
than a health care intervention

00:39:48.630 --> 00:39:51.097
where you treat a patient and
that patient derives benefit.

00:39:51.097 --> 00:39:52.680
If you're thinking
about, for example,

00:39:52.680 --> 00:39:54.120
food insecure individuals.

00:39:54.120 --> 00:39:57.401
If I had a senior who
didn't have enough food, who

00:39:57.401 --> 00:39:59.400
was dependent on their
daughter or granddaughter

00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:01.920
to help make sure
they ate every day

00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:03.420
and we worked with
them to make them

00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:05.490
less dependent on
that family member,

00:40:05.490 --> 00:40:07.020
we've actually
unlocked capabilities

00:40:07.020 --> 00:40:09.180
across the whole family.

00:40:09.180 --> 00:40:11.650
And that's really a powerful
set of interventions.

00:40:11.650 --> 00:40:13.200
And so thinking
about social care

00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:14.825
both as an understanding
of what people

00:40:14.825 --> 00:40:16.999
social abilities,
their needs are,

00:40:16.999 --> 00:40:18.540
and then addressing
those just as you

00:40:18.540 --> 00:40:21.580
would any other part of
their health care needs

00:40:21.580 --> 00:40:23.580
can be a really powerful
way to start to address

00:40:23.580 --> 00:40:26.865
the burden on caregivers.

00:40:26.865 --> 00:40:30.214
MARGOT SANGER-KATZ: Do we
have any audience questions?

00:40:30.214 --> 00:40:30.880
Yes, right here.

00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:33.319
If we can get a microphone.

00:40:33.319 --> 00:40:34.360
AUDIENCE: Good afternoon.

00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:36.730
Thank you so much for what
you guys have shared so far.

00:40:36.730 --> 00:40:39.816
So I'm Brian Buckley, a
second year DrPH student.

00:40:39.816 --> 00:40:41.190
And so you've
talked a little bit

00:40:41.190 --> 00:40:43.320
about the aspect of
social care and how

00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:46.620
care's really expanding outside
the four walls of the hospital.

00:40:46.620 --> 00:40:49.980
I'm interested in the role of
TeleHealth and home-based care.

00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:52.410
And where do you see it
both on the opportunity cost

00:40:52.410 --> 00:40:54.750
side of things,
but also reducing

00:40:54.750 --> 00:40:56.910
financial costs and
different reimbursements that

00:40:56.910 --> 00:40:57.837
can go with that?

00:41:01.975 --> 00:41:04.300
TOYIN AJAYI: Bob,
you have to start.

00:41:04.300 --> 00:41:06.759
ROBERT MASTER: I was going to
say the same thing about you.

00:41:06.759 --> 00:41:08.133
TOYIN AJAYI: I
learned everything

00:41:08.133 --> 00:41:09.930
that I know about
this at this speech.

00:41:09.930 --> 00:41:12.292
So I could never.

00:41:12.292 --> 00:41:13.750
ROBERT MASTER:
There is no question

00:41:13.750 --> 00:41:18.460
that I think that if you
enable a clinical clinician

00:41:18.460 --> 00:41:23.180
with TeleHealth ability to
actually access the home,

00:41:23.180 --> 00:41:24.790
that's a step up.

00:41:24.790 --> 00:41:29.620
The concern I have is where
the love affair with technology

00:41:29.620 --> 00:41:32.030
is a replacement
for the care system.

00:41:32.030 --> 00:41:36.850
I think it's an enabler and an
enhancement to a care system.

00:41:36.850 --> 00:41:40.700
But it really still starts
with that home-based personal

00:41:40.700 --> 00:41:41.200
capacity.

00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:43.540
How do we move primary
care into the home?

00:41:43.540 --> 00:41:45.680
How do we have a
response to new problems?

00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:49.840
How do we allocate the right
amount of long term services

00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:55.640
and support services
that are needed?

00:41:55.640 --> 00:41:59.620
And then TeleHealth clearly,
I think, can enhance that.

00:41:59.620 --> 00:42:03.210
But in and of itself,
without a system redesign,

00:42:03.210 --> 00:42:04.799
I have problems.

00:42:04.799 --> 00:42:06.340
I don't know, what
do you think Tory?

00:42:06.340 --> 00:42:07.214
TOYIN AJAYI: I agree.

00:42:07.214 --> 00:42:08.600
I mean, of course I agree 100%.

00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:12.220
I mean, I think going back to
the foundational principles

00:42:12.220 --> 00:42:14.920
of what we're trying to solve
for, when we have people

00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:17.680
with serious illness
with multiple competing

00:42:17.680 --> 00:42:22.510
concerns, who also either in
addition to and before they

00:42:22.510 --> 00:42:24.350
became seriously ill,
or as a consequence

00:42:24.350 --> 00:42:27.790
of the serious illness, are also
struggling with social needs,

00:42:27.790 --> 00:42:30.240
that home visit and
that home-based care

00:42:30.240 --> 00:42:34.820
is just catalytic in two ways.

00:42:34.820 --> 00:42:36.610
One, I think the
questioner asked

00:42:36.610 --> 00:42:39.070
about kind of the opportunity
cost, and that's huge.

00:42:39.070 --> 00:42:43.330
It's moving people from
the whole cycle of getting

00:42:43.330 --> 00:42:46.120
into a clinic multiple
times, sometimes even

00:42:46.120 --> 00:42:48.640
multiple times a
week, saves them time

00:42:48.640 --> 00:42:51.770
and allows them to do other
things, which is important.

00:42:51.770 --> 00:42:54.010
But there's also
foundational kind

00:42:54.010 --> 00:42:57.700
of values and trust
building exercise

00:42:57.700 --> 00:43:01.600
that happens when human
being from the care system

00:43:01.600 --> 00:43:03.610
steps foot in
their patients home

00:43:03.610 --> 00:43:06.970
that is just
incredibly powerful.

00:43:06.970 --> 00:43:11.110
It re-balances the
patient-provider relationship.

00:43:11.110 --> 00:43:14.200
You know as a physician
going into a patient's home,

00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:15.920
I wait for them.

00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:17.570
I see them on their own terms.

00:43:17.570 --> 00:43:21.370
I am humbled in their presence,
which is really important when

00:43:21.370 --> 00:43:23.927
I think that this is a
person I want to call me

00:43:23.927 --> 00:43:25.510
instead of going to
the emergency room

00:43:25.510 --> 00:43:26.740
when they're feeling sick.

00:43:26.740 --> 00:43:27.910
They need to trust me.

00:43:27.910 --> 00:43:29.860
And you don't trust
somebody who you

00:43:29.860 --> 00:43:31.600
don't feel like
you can relate to,

00:43:31.600 --> 00:43:34.240
who you don't feel
like is there for you,

00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:35.570
and who doesn't listen to you.

00:43:35.570 --> 00:43:37.720
And so being able to just
establish that foundation

00:43:37.720 --> 00:43:39.220
is so powerful.

00:43:39.220 --> 00:43:41.680
What we found is that
if you layer TeleHealth

00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:43.930
on top of that
trusted relationship,

00:43:43.930 --> 00:43:48.220
you unlock a ton of potential
for the ease of 24/7 access

00:43:48.220 --> 00:43:51.700
and for the ability
to operationally

00:43:51.700 --> 00:43:54.577
kind of scale its type of
very human-centered approach.

00:43:54.577 --> 00:43:55.910
And we do that a couple of ways.

00:43:55.910 --> 00:44:00.820
One is following a series
of really in-depth,

00:44:00.820 --> 00:44:03.556
in-person conversations with
members of the care team,

00:44:03.556 --> 00:44:06.055
we find that our patients are
much more likely to than video

00:44:06.055 --> 00:44:10.210
in, or tele-visit, or
text us, or call us

00:44:10.210 --> 00:44:11.630
when they're having needs.

00:44:11.630 --> 00:44:13.780
The other thing that we
think is really interesting

00:44:13.780 --> 00:44:16.879
is allowing a different
member of the care team--

00:44:16.879 --> 00:44:18.670
we've talked about
interdisciplinary teams.

00:44:18.670 --> 00:44:20.780
Bob Master talked
about this earlier,

00:44:20.780 --> 00:44:22.570
but really thinking
about the power

00:44:22.570 --> 00:44:25.902
of non-clinically licensed
individuals on a care team.

00:44:25.902 --> 00:44:27.860
At Cityblock, we use
community health partners.

00:44:27.860 --> 00:44:30.250
These are folks who are
not clinically licensed.

00:44:30.250 --> 00:44:33.370
They're hired from the
communities that we serve.

00:44:33.370 --> 00:44:35.920
They are hired for empathy,
and for listening skills,

00:44:35.920 --> 00:44:37.300
and for trust building.

00:44:37.300 --> 00:44:39.310
And they go into
a patient's home

00:44:39.310 --> 00:44:41.632
and say, hey, it sounds
like that wound on your leg

00:44:41.632 --> 00:44:42.590
isn't looking so great.

00:44:42.590 --> 00:44:45.550
What if we just video the doctor
in right now to look at that?

00:44:45.550 --> 00:44:47.410
They're facilitating
that interaction

00:44:47.410 --> 00:44:50.150
that allows the doctor to be
more efficient with their time,

00:44:50.150 --> 00:44:52.210
but still has that
human contact.

00:44:52.210 --> 00:44:53.880
And using those
individuals in the trust

00:44:53.880 --> 00:44:56.005
that they build with our
patients and our community

00:44:56.005 --> 00:44:58.070
members as a bridge to
the health care system

00:44:58.070 --> 00:45:00.137
is also incredibly powerful.

00:45:00.137 --> 00:45:02.720
So I agree, I think technology
has to be part of the solution,

00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:05.560
but it does not
function particularly

00:45:05.560 --> 00:45:07.900
in this population with
absent, really solid

00:45:07.900 --> 00:45:11.285
trusted human relationships.

00:45:11.285 --> 00:45:15.100
MARGOT SANGER-KATZ: So
we have another question

00:45:15.100 --> 00:45:16.662
that's come by email.

00:45:16.662 --> 00:45:18.370
Has the Affordable
Care Act helped people

00:45:18.370 --> 00:45:20.260
with serious illness?

00:45:20.260 --> 00:45:21.610
If so, in what ways?

00:45:21.610 --> 00:45:24.580
And are there policy
changes happening now

00:45:24.580 --> 00:45:26.830
or threats to the
ACA that could be

00:45:26.830 --> 00:45:32.060
important in changing those
improvements if they exist?

00:45:32.060 --> 00:45:33.490
ROBERT BLENDON:
So we can't answer

00:45:33.490 --> 00:45:37.030
that because no one's been
tracking this group of people.

00:45:37.030 --> 00:45:40.000
Obviously, we covered a lot
of people with insurance

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:41.290
and the benefits went up.

00:45:41.290 --> 00:45:43.960
What's staggering here, the
people we're interviewing

00:45:43.960 --> 00:45:45.400
are post ACA.

00:45:45.400 --> 00:45:47.810
Good news, you have no problems.

00:45:47.810 --> 00:45:50.042
So they have the
post ACA benefits.

00:45:50.042 --> 00:45:51.500
And I'm looking at
this and saying,

00:45:51.500 --> 00:45:54.170
wow, what could
have been before?

00:45:54.170 --> 00:45:57.550
So the answer is whatever we
have done have really protected

00:45:57.550 --> 00:45:59.050
people without insurance.

00:45:59.050 --> 00:46:02.690
But this crowd of very seriously
ill people with insurance

00:46:02.690 --> 00:46:03.710
are not being protected.

00:46:03.710 --> 00:46:07.310
You can have these
scale bills for that.

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:12.860
But coming out of the
world competition,

00:46:12.860 --> 00:46:14.900
and I love competition,
but this idea

00:46:14.900 --> 00:46:18.380
choose what you need is a very
dangerous assumption coming out

00:46:18.380 --> 00:46:21.290
of this, cause you
just don't know

00:46:21.290 --> 00:46:22.860
what it's going to work out.

00:46:22.860 --> 00:46:26.900
And I think post ACA, the
fact that so many people--

00:46:26.900 --> 00:46:29.270
I have a drug benefit,
it's protecting me--

00:46:29.270 --> 00:46:31.440
you're paying $50,000 a year.

00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:34.610
So we didn't do a
particularly good job

00:46:34.610 --> 00:46:38.750
of guaranteeing that that
prescription that you think

00:46:38.750 --> 00:46:42.250
your physician absolutely has
to have is in your drug benefit.

00:46:42.250 --> 00:46:43.800
But this could be fixed.

00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:46.250
But we have not followed
this group of people.

00:46:46.250 --> 00:46:48.980
What we mostly just
follow is general public.

00:46:48.980 --> 00:46:50.980
They are better off,
particularly if you've

00:46:50.980 --> 00:46:51.939
got insurance coverage.

00:46:51.939 --> 00:46:53.438
MARGOT SANGER-KATZ:
The ACA coverage

00:46:53.438 --> 00:46:55.150
has out-of-pocket
maximums, right?

00:46:55.150 --> 00:46:57.770
So people who are facing
$50,000 in drug coverage

00:46:57.770 --> 00:47:01.130
are probably in Medicare, right?

00:47:01.130 --> 00:47:03.487
I guess they have a
catastrophic benefit, too.

00:47:03.487 --> 00:47:05.570
ROBERT BLENDON: The answer
is half our people said

00:47:05.570 --> 00:47:07.230
they had to pay it themselves.

00:47:07.230 --> 00:47:09.320
So what is necessary,
and that's why

00:47:09.320 --> 00:47:11.390
I don't think individuals
should have to do this,

00:47:11.390 --> 00:47:14.600
is to get a sample of people
and go through their bills,

00:47:14.600 --> 00:47:17.024
and were I've been told
I've been guaranteed

00:47:17.024 --> 00:47:18.440
by the federal
government, and I'm

00:47:18.440 --> 00:47:22.950
paying thousands of thousands
of dollars out for this.

00:47:22.950 --> 00:47:24.920
So what we think we
guaranteed, if you

00:47:24.920 --> 00:47:26.660
look at these
people's experiences,

00:47:26.660 --> 00:47:28.710
doesn't actually
work out that way.

00:47:28.710 --> 00:47:30.710
But we can't answer it
now, because actually we

00:47:30.710 --> 00:47:32.780
didn't think the problem
would be that severe.

00:47:32.780 --> 00:47:36.097
We didn't go up and say, can you
describe each bucket of bills

00:47:36.097 --> 00:47:36.680
that you have?

00:47:36.680 --> 00:47:39.080
But somehow, this
catastrophic feature

00:47:39.080 --> 00:47:41.090
is not protecting these
people or they wouldn't

00:47:41.090 --> 00:47:42.950
have those substantial bills.

00:47:42.950 --> 00:47:45.680
ERIC SCHNEIDER: One thing that
I mentioned is the sort of 65

00:47:45.680 --> 00:47:48.440
and under group who are
not Medicare eligible

00:47:48.440 --> 00:47:52.430
now have protection against
pre-existing conditions.

00:47:52.430 --> 00:47:54.590
That was a big problem
in health insurance

00:47:54.590 --> 00:47:56.660
market prior to the ACA.

00:47:58.710 --> 00:48:00.710
MARGOT SANGER-KATZ: Please
explain what that is.

00:48:00.710 --> 00:48:03.380
ERIC SCHNEIDER: Sorry,
yes, so it used to be.

00:48:03.380 --> 00:48:06.500
It may still be under some of
the ACA non-compliant health

00:48:06.500 --> 00:48:09.290
plans that you
can have insurance

00:48:09.290 --> 00:48:12.596
and the insurer can decide
that because you have

00:48:12.596 --> 00:48:13.970
a preexisting
condition, and that

00:48:13.970 --> 00:48:15.692
could be a lot of
different things,

00:48:15.692 --> 00:48:17.150
and certainly these
folks are going

00:48:17.150 --> 00:48:21.440
to have preexisting conditions
by the insurance definition,

00:48:21.440 --> 00:48:24.980
they could either refuse
to renew your insurance

00:48:24.980 --> 00:48:27.380
or they could raise
the price to the point

00:48:27.380 --> 00:48:29.540
where you couldn't
afford the premium,

00:48:29.540 --> 00:48:33.020
or raise the deductible or use
other financial machinations.

00:48:33.020 --> 00:48:36.200
And so the reversal
and the uninsured rate

00:48:36.200 --> 00:48:38.390
that brought about by
the ACA is, in big part,

00:48:38.390 --> 00:48:40.640
because people who
couldn't get insurance

00:48:40.640 --> 00:48:44.690
in the prior pre-ACA world now
can get insurance coverage.

00:48:44.690 --> 00:48:48.140
They still may have problems,
but certainly they're

00:48:48.140 --> 00:48:50.900
not just sort of abandoned
on the street, uninsured

00:48:50.900 --> 00:48:54.932
using public facilities
if they do that.

00:48:54.932 --> 00:48:56.390
ROBERT MASTER: Just
to add, I think

00:48:56.390 --> 00:49:00.490
the ACA has been an
unmitigated blessing

00:49:00.490 --> 00:49:03.800
and it has a long way to go.

00:49:03.800 --> 00:49:09.860
But if we add to what
talking about with people

00:49:09.860 --> 00:49:12.439
with preexisting
conditions, in the ACA

00:49:12.439 --> 00:49:14.480
there was a provision for
the Center for Medicare

00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:16.250
and Medicaid Innovation.

00:49:16.250 --> 00:49:18.300
And substantially funded.

00:49:18.300 --> 00:49:21.530
And a good example of
the kind of innovations

00:49:21.530 --> 00:49:24.620
were really very, very
relevant to the populations

00:49:24.620 --> 00:49:26.620
that we're talking about.

00:49:26.620 --> 00:49:29.480
And that example
is, among others,

00:49:29.480 --> 00:49:32.900
was Mount Sinai Hospital that
looked at its frail elder

00:49:32.900 --> 00:49:37.580
Medicare beneficiaries that
were identified as what we call

00:49:37.580 --> 00:49:40.560
in health care frequent flyers,
back and forth, back and forth,

00:49:40.560 --> 00:49:44.150
back and forth to the hospital
because the system just wasn't

00:49:44.150 --> 00:49:46.410
organized for their care.

00:49:46.410 --> 00:49:50.570
And in fact, many of the
issues of hospital care

00:49:50.570 --> 00:49:55.820
made things worse in terms
of drug-resistant organisms

00:49:55.820 --> 00:49:59.870
and the like, and transitions
for skilled nursing facilities.

00:49:59.870 --> 00:50:03.800
And so the idea of could we
take a pre-identified population

00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:06.680
with complex chronic
illness, low thresholds

00:50:06.680 --> 00:50:10.190
to these hospitalizations, and
think about a different path

00:50:10.190 --> 00:50:10.850
for them.

00:50:10.850 --> 00:50:12.590
And it started out
a different path

00:50:12.590 --> 00:50:16.160
through the emergency room,
and maybe an infirmary bed.

00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:19.610
But where it evolved in the
second iteration in 2014,

00:50:19.610 --> 00:50:22.370
and this is just one
example, is maybe

00:50:22.370 --> 00:50:23.960
we don't need to
hospitalize them

00:50:23.960 --> 00:50:27.470
at all if we can put all the
components of hospital care

00:50:27.470 --> 00:50:30.980
at home for this frail elder
and think about what that

00:50:30.980 --> 00:50:33.470
does to the transitions
and all of the risks

00:50:33.470 --> 00:50:34.940
around transitions.

00:50:34.940 --> 00:50:38.120
And that, again, is
the kind of thing

00:50:38.120 --> 00:50:40.220
that did not happen
systematically

00:50:40.220 --> 00:50:42.320
prior to the ACA.

00:50:42.320 --> 00:50:47.480
And the benefits will not
accrue on any scale maybe

00:50:47.480 --> 00:50:49.280
for another five to eight years.

00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:52.820
But I am predicting a Medicare
bundled payment for a hospital

00:50:52.820 --> 00:51:00.060
at home DRG then is
paid to hospital today

00:51:00.060 --> 00:51:04.140
and the potential transfer of
substantial numbers of patients

00:51:04.140 --> 00:51:07.170
that are on our
medical floors today

00:51:07.170 --> 00:51:10.370
to home-based care in
a handful of years.

00:51:13.497 --> 00:51:15.580
TOYIN AJAYI: Yeah, I
wouldn't say much more except

00:51:15.580 --> 00:51:19.930
to echo that I think in the
spirit of Bob's comment,

00:51:19.930 --> 00:51:22.090
a ton of innovation
has occurred,

00:51:22.090 --> 00:51:26.980
some catalyzed by CMMI and
by the dual demonstrations,

00:51:26.980 --> 00:51:29.230
the demonstrations
that allow integration

00:51:29.230 --> 00:51:31.390
of Medicare and Medicaid
plans for people

00:51:31.390 --> 00:51:34.060
who are duly eligible.

00:51:34.060 --> 00:51:37.200
Those have both, I think,
informed and shaped

00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:39.752
an emerging generation,
I think, of leaders

00:51:39.752 --> 00:51:41.710
within that kind of health
care transformation.

00:51:41.710 --> 00:51:44.020
I would consider
myself one of those.

00:51:44.020 --> 00:51:47.890
As well as starting to
contribute to our published

00:51:47.890 --> 00:51:50.260
literature on what works for
taking care of populations

00:51:50.260 --> 00:51:52.510
with complex needs,
even a lexicon

00:51:52.510 --> 00:51:56.020
around who those folks
are, how you identify them.

00:51:56.020 --> 00:51:59.180
And then what types of care,
including hospital and home,

00:51:59.180 --> 00:52:01.460
including community
para-medicine models,

00:52:01.460 --> 00:52:03.790
including complex
care management,

00:52:03.790 --> 00:52:05.290
interdisciplinary
care teams, all

00:52:05.290 --> 00:52:08.677
of the principles that we
bring to the work that we do

00:52:08.677 --> 00:52:10.510
have had a chance to
be baked and germinated

00:52:10.510 --> 00:52:11.759
through an innovation process.

00:52:11.759 --> 00:52:14.500
And it is a remarkable
moment in time

00:52:14.500 --> 00:52:18.230
when we can say collectively as
a community, we have a problem.

00:52:18.230 --> 00:52:21.400
And this problem is both
access and the quality of care

00:52:21.400 --> 00:52:23.390
that we provide to people
who really need it.

00:52:23.390 --> 00:52:25.681
And we're going to try to
throw a whole bunch of things

00:52:25.681 --> 00:52:27.640
at the wall, see what sticks.

00:52:27.640 --> 00:52:30.040
And this is the point
in which we're really

00:52:30.040 --> 00:52:32.530
asking, well, how do we
scale what we know works now?

00:52:32.530 --> 00:52:35.177
It's a very different point in
time than where we were even,

00:52:35.177 --> 00:52:37.510
you know, seven or eight years
ago when we didn't really

00:52:37.510 --> 00:52:38.500
know what worked.

00:52:38.500 --> 00:52:39.580
We know what works now.

00:52:39.580 --> 00:52:42.591
And folks like myself and
others across the country

00:52:42.591 --> 00:52:44.840
is saying, all right, well
how do put this on steroids

00:52:44.840 --> 00:52:46.870
so we scale it to all
the people who need it.

00:52:46.870 --> 00:52:50.740
It's a very different problem,
but it comes very much out

00:52:50.740 --> 00:52:52.570
of the legacy of so
much of the work that

00:52:52.570 --> 00:52:55.400
has been done at places
like Commonwealth Care

00:52:55.400 --> 00:52:56.962
Alliance and others.

00:52:56.962 --> 00:52:58.420
MARGOT SANGER-KATZ:
I think we have

00:52:58.420 --> 00:52:59.878
time for one more
audience question

00:52:59.878 --> 00:53:02.170
if someone has a good one.

00:53:02.170 --> 00:53:04.090
Oh, sorry, I've made
the pressure too high.

00:53:07.860 --> 00:53:09.320
AUDIENCE: Hello
thank you so much.

00:53:09.320 --> 00:53:10.385
My name is Raven Bachan.

00:53:10.385 --> 00:53:12.010
I'm a master's in
public health student

00:53:12.010 --> 00:53:14.320
and I'm also a medical
student at home.

00:53:14.320 --> 00:53:17.480
And sometimes it feels like
these conversations are often

00:53:17.480 --> 00:53:19.480
in the public health world
but not often brought

00:53:19.480 --> 00:53:22.210
to the academic medical world.

00:53:22.210 --> 00:53:23.710
So I was just
wondering what you see

00:53:23.710 --> 00:53:26.470
as the role of
academic health centers

00:53:26.470 --> 00:53:28.600
in training our future
physicians to have

00:53:28.600 --> 00:53:31.442
these sort of values, whether
it's the education on how

00:53:31.442 --> 00:53:33.400
to have these conversations
with their patients

00:53:33.400 --> 00:53:37.360
or shifting the norm of bringing
primary care to the homes,

00:53:37.360 --> 00:53:39.610
and how we can hold
the academic medicine

00:53:39.610 --> 00:53:42.732
centers accountable for
assisting in these goals?

00:53:42.732 --> 00:53:44.690
MARGOT SANGER-KATZ: What
a great last question.

00:53:44.690 --> 00:53:45.640
ERIC SCHNEIDER: That's
wonderful question.

00:53:45.640 --> 00:53:47.740
MARGOT SANGER-KATZ:
So I want to just flag

00:53:47.740 --> 00:53:49.810
as you guys think about
your answers the thing

00:53:49.810 --> 00:53:52.900
that Toyin said early on
about how clinicians often

00:53:52.900 --> 00:53:55.605
don't ask their patients
about the financial aspects

00:53:55.605 --> 00:53:57.730
of their care in addition
to their clinical aspects

00:53:57.730 --> 00:53:59.750
of their care.

00:53:59.750 --> 00:54:02.320
ERIC SCHNEIDER: So having
practiced and taught

00:54:02.320 --> 00:54:05.080
in a local academic
medical center

00:54:05.080 --> 00:54:09.070
for many years,
primary care, I have

00:54:09.070 --> 00:54:12.880
to confess that as I was
doing my research going out

00:54:12.880 --> 00:54:15.520
into the field looking at
other primary care practices,

00:54:15.520 --> 00:54:17.980
I discovered that academic
medical centers are often

00:54:17.980 --> 00:54:21.010
the least interested in change.

00:54:21.010 --> 00:54:24.815
They've been the slowest to pick
up some of these challenges.

00:54:24.815 --> 00:54:26.440
I'm saying it in sort
of a blanket way.

00:54:26.440 --> 00:54:28.240
It's not entirely true.

00:54:28.240 --> 00:54:29.800
But I've started
to see that change,

00:54:29.800 --> 00:54:33.100
the Association of
Academic Medical Colleges,

00:54:33.100 --> 00:54:35.620
has taken on the innovation
agenda of something

00:54:35.620 --> 00:54:36.790
they want to teach.

00:54:36.790 --> 00:54:39.190
And I think the piece
that's always been missing

00:54:39.190 --> 00:54:42.700
is the desire to do
interdisciplinary training

00:54:42.700 --> 00:54:45.520
and the need to design
interdisciplinary training so

00:54:45.520 --> 00:54:47.920
that the teams learn how
to function, especially

00:54:47.920 --> 00:54:49.095
for patients like this.

00:54:49.095 --> 00:54:50.470
ROBERT MASTER:
Just very quickly,

00:54:50.470 --> 00:54:53.050
one of my mentors
when I was younger,

00:54:53.050 --> 00:54:55.450
Jack Geiger had
this saying, trying

00:54:55.450 --> 00:54:58.900
to teach the principles of
personalized coordinated

00:54:58.900 --> 00:55:01.780
primary care in an
academic medical center

00:55:01.780 --> 00:55:04.480
is like trying to teach
the principles of forestry

00:55:04.480 --> 00:55:07.240
in a lumber yard.

00:55:07.240 --> 00:55:10.710
Now, that was back then.

00:55:10.710 --> 00:55:13.150
And it's come away.

00:55:13.150 --> 00:55:16.074
But I think I have
to say I don't

00:55:16.074 --> 00:55:17.490
think that's the
place we're going

00:55:17.490 --> 00:55:19.180
to see these kind of changes.

00:55:22.120 --> 00:55:26.020
TOYIN AJAYI: I'm going to have
to double down on that one.

00:55:26.020 --> 00:55:30.100
I think we need a radical
overhaul of what we believe

00:55:30.100 --> 00:55:33.760
our role is as
physicians and the voice

00:55:33.760 --> 00:55:34.930
that we give to patients.

00:55:34.930 --> 00:55:39.160
And how we interact with other
members of the care team,

00:55:39.160 --> 00:55:42.010
how we value them, and
how we interact with them,

00:55:42.010 --> 00:55:46.990
I think, is really hard to teach
in the proverbial ivory tower

00:55:46.990 --> 00:55:49.480
where academic
medicine continues

00:55:49.480 --> 00:55:51.430
to be such a hierarchy
and continues

00:55:51.430 --> 00:55:57.550
to privilege research and
specialization over what, you

00:55:57.550 --> 00:56:00.370
know, I believe in as
the kind of foundation

00:56:00.370 --> 00:56:02.620
of a good primary
care, which is humility

00:56:02.620 --> 00:56:04.330
and partnership with
community members

00:56:04.330 --> 00:56:06.700
and patients and
their advocates,

00:56:06.700 --> 00:56:09.760
and a willingness to not
have all the answers,

00:56:09.760 --> 00:56:12.850
and understanding that
you can't fix everything,

00:56:12.850 --> 00:56:16.600
and the patients to walk
with people on their path

00:56:16.600 --> 00:56:17.860
to better health.

00:56:17.860 --> 00:56:21.580
I think it is still
the case that folks

00:56:21.580 --> 00:56:24.040
who enter those types
of institutions looking

00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:25.990
for that type of
an experience often

00:56:25.990 --> 00:56:28.460
find their way out of the
academic medical center.

00:56:28.460 --> 00:56:31.150
And I actually think
that the folks who

00:56:31.150 --> 00:56:34.080
are going to force this to
come to a head in the big sort

00:56:34.080 --> 00:56:37.420
of bastions of academic
medical education, I hope,

00:56:37.420 --> 00:56:40.180
are going to be patients
and consumers who say,

00:56:40.180 --> 00:56:42.970
I want something different
for my health care system.

00:56:42.970 --> 00:56:46.630
I want to be able to get the
very best of new technology

00:56:46.630 --> 00:56:48.700
in cancer care and
also to be made

00:56:48.700 --> 00:56:51.820
to feel truly human in
every aspect of my life

00:56:51.820 --> 00:56:53.560
in health care that
I interact with.

00:56:53.560 --> 00:56:56.200
I want my specialist
who is a world renowned

00:56:56.200 --> 00:56:57.940
X or Y to talk to my
primary care doctor

00:56:57.940 --> 00:56:59.440
who knows what
really matters to me.

00:56:59.440 --> 00:57:02.140
And I'm going to force that
to happen through advocacy

00:57:02.140 --> 00:57:03.640
and through policy.

00:57:03.640 --> 00:57:07.429
But largely, I hope patients
would vote with their feet

00:57:07.429 --> 00:57:09.220
about where they go
and what they privilege

00:57:09.220 --> 00:57:11.012
and what they value in
those relationships.

00:57:11.012 --> 00:57:12.428
MARGOT SANGER-KATZ:
So we're going

00:57:12.428 --> 00:57:14.290
to end with sort of
a lightning round

00:57:14.290 --> 00:57:17.600
where I'm going to ask each
of our panelists to tell us,

00:57:17.600 --> 00:57:19.510
like a short sort
of take away lesson,

00:57:19.510 --> 00:57:21.910
solution, something
that you think

00:57:21.910 --> 00:57:23.812
emerges from this
conversation that you

00:57:23.812 --> 00:57:26.020
want to keep thinking about
and you want our audience

00:57:26.020 --> 00:57:27.250
to keep thinking about.

00:57:27.250 --> 00:57:28.580
And Bob, can I start with you?

00:57:28.580 --> 00:57:30.820
ROBERT BLENDON:
Yeah, I'm simple.

00:57:30.820 --> 00:57:34.930
We need a independent rating
of policies which basically

00:57:34.930 --> 00:57:37.690
gives you a star and says if
something terrible happens

00:57:37.690 --> 00:57:39.020
to you, it will cover it.

00:57:39.020 --> 00:57:43.100
I have very little use for
this physician information.

00:57:43.100 --> 00:57:46.020
The average physician time
is 15 minutes with a patient.

00:57:46.020 --> 00:57:48.107
There are 50 different
policies out there.

00:57:48.107 --> 00:57:50.440
The doctor who's trying to
figure out what you should do

00:57:50.440 --> 00:57:54.820
is not going to decide if
Aetna 5 or Blue Cross 4

00:57:54.820 --> 00:57:56.610
is right for you.

00:57:56.610 --> 00:57:58.220
But we need certifications.

00:57:58.220 --> 00:58:01.117
Secondly, I got to defend
people who are at home.

00:58:01.117 --> 00:58:02.950
We're sending everybody
home, and the people

00:58:02.950 --> 00:58:05.480
who are answering us have
the thrill of their home

00:58:05.480 --> 00:58:11.030
care new system being their
daughter, their spouse,

00:58:11.030 --> 00:58:12.340
their brother, et cetera.

00:58:12.340 --> 00:58:14.090
If we are going to
send these people home,

00:58:14.090 --> 00:58:15.800
we'd better have Bob's system.

00:58:15.800 --> 00:58:20.320
Because we have people who
have to cut back their lives

00:58:20.320 --> 00:58:22.300
because mom is coming home.

00:58:22.300 --> 00:58:24.050
I told you about this,
we're about to have

00:58:24.050 --> 00:58:28.100
the largest population ever
in US history over age 65.

00:58:28.100 --> 00:58:31.070
If you have a parent,
good news, in our study,

00:58:31.070 --> 00:58:33.450
you are about to become
a primary caregiver.

00:58:33.450 --> 00:58:36.439
And so unless we can put
Bob's type system in here,

00:58:36.439 --> 00:58:38.480
we are not going to be
protecting a lot of people

00:58:38.480 --> 00:58:39.770
as we send them home.

00:58:39.770 --> 00:58:42.630
They need X hours of time.

00:58:42.630 --> 00:58:45.500
So we need something that
protects those family members

00:58:45.500 --> 00:58:48.890
and we need a certification
on an insurance policy.

00:58:48.890 --> 00:58:50.670
And that is a public
responsibility.

00:58:50.670 --> 00:58:53.520
I don't care if it's a
local fire department.

00:58:53.520 --> 00:58:55.230
But somebody has
to put a stamp on

00:58:55.230 --> 00:58:57.680
and say, don't worry
about the 54 pages.

00:58:57.680 --> 00:59:00.107
It'll protect you if
you buy this policy.

00:59:00.107 --> 00:59:01.940
ERIC SCHNEIDER: And
mine will be very short,

00:59:01.940 --> 00:59:04.887
if you want innovations
and you're not finding them

00:59:04.887 --> 00:59:06.470
in your local academic
medical center,

00:59:06.470 --> 00:59:08.190
or wherever else
you're practicing,

00:59:08.190 --> 00:59:12.890
bettercareplaybook.org is the
sixth foundation website where

00:59:12.890 --> 00:59:16.790
we're collecting these
evidence-based innovations,

00:59:16.790 --> 00:59:19.310
community health workers
with telemedicine,

00:59:19.310 --> 00:59:21.110
CCET I believe is in there.

00:59:21.110 --> 00:59:23.870
But there are a lot of
models of care growing up

00:59:23.870 --> 00:59:26.990
outside of sort of
traditional academic centers

00:59:26.990 --> 00:59:28.407
that are available to people.

00:59:28.407 --> 00:59:29.990
ROBERT MASTER: And
very, very quickly.

00:59:29.990 --> 00:59:34.160
You know through the decades
of my career, most or all

00:59:34.160 --> 00:59:37.610
of the innovation tried to
occur on the insurance side.

00:59:37.610 --> 00:59:39.830
Case management,
demand management,

00:59:39.830 --> 00:59:43.100
disease management all failures.

00:59:43.100 --> 00:59:45.920
I don't know how much money
was spent on all of that.

00:59:45.920 --> 00:59:51.080
The name of the game is
care system redesign.

00:59:51.080 --> 00:59:52.670
And it's a values redesign.

00:59:52.670 --> 00:59:56.360
And Toyin really speaks to
it unbelievably, eloquently.

00:59:56.360 --> 00:59:59.780
In fact, it's such a
pleasure to hear her.

00:59:59.780 --> 01:00:08.390
And I actually see the
future of spreading Toyin--

01:00:08.390 --> 01:00:13.540
force multiplying Toyin
across the country.

01:00:13.540 --> 01:00:15.680
MARGOT SANGER-KATZ: All
right Toyin, take a bow.

01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:18.980
TOYIN AJAYI: I think speaking
to aspiring clinicians, health

01:00:18.980 --> 01:00:21.680
system leaders, or people
who are in that role,

01:00:21.680 --> 01:00:23.630
I think that the name
of the game for me

01:00:23.630 --> 01:00:27.590
is just ask patients, how much
is this going to cost you?

01:00:27.590 --> 01:00:32.690
And every aspect of the word
cost, time, self-esteem,

01:00:32.690 --> 01:00:35.690
social relationships,
dollar bills--

01:00:35.690 --> 01:00:38.570
we have to the systemize asking,
because what we find here

01:00:38.570 --> 01:00:41.480
is that if we don't
ask, we can't mitigate

01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:42.644
and we can't intervene.

01:00:42.644 --> 01:00:44.060
And then that
person who shows up,

01:00:44.060 --> 01:00:45.685
who's not taking
their medications, who

01:00:45.685 --> 01:00:49.520
gets labeled as non-compliant
is struggling with poverty.

01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:52.160
And we can address that.

01:00:52.160 --> 01:00:53.449
We just need to ask.

01:00:53.449 --> 01:00:55.490
MARGOT SANGER-KATZ: I want
to thank our audience,

01:00:55.490 --> 01:00:57.770
and also thank our great
panel, and all the people

01:00:57.770 --> 01:00:59.056
wrote in with questions.

01:00:59.056 --> 01:01:00.180
This has been really great.

01:01:00.180 --> 01:01:01.010
I've learned some things.

01:01:01.010 --> 01:01:02.090
I hope you all have too.

01:01:02.090 --> 01:01:02.600
Take care.

01:01:08.300 --> 01:01:11.050
