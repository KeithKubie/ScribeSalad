[Applause]
 

00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:03.740
[Applause]
both questions about dialogue and

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750
both questions about dialogue and
 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.720
both questions about dialogue and
engaging in dialogue with people so the

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730
engaging in dialogue with people so the
 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.930
engaging in dialogue with people so the
first issue that I face is I have a very

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940
first issue that I face is I have a very
 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.490
first issue that I face is I have a very
high need for intellectual stimulation

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500
high need for intellectual stimulation
 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.150
high need for intellectual stimulation
and I can't get that with most people

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160
and I can't get that with most people
 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.599
and I can't get that with most people
it's something like you can you can have

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609
it's something like you can you can have
 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.359
it's something like you can you can have
a dialogue for a time but then titrate

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369
a dialogue for a time but then titrate
 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.660
a dialogue for a time but then titrate
openness yeah and then out then they

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670
openness yeah and then out then they
 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.580
openness yeah and then out then they
sort of run out of ideas they can keep

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590
sort of run out of ideas they can keep
 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.670
sort of run out of ideas they can keep
up and it sort of falls apart okay this

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680
up and it sort of falls apart okay this
 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.439
up and it sort of falls apart okay this
is the problem that intellectuals have

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449
is the problem that intellectuals have
 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.920
is the problem that intellectuals have
are quite frequently is that they sort

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930
are quite frequently is that they sort
 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.750
are quite frequently is that they sort
of once they start reading difficult and

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760
of once they start reading difficult and
 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.670
of once they start reading difficult and
rewarding stuff yeah they stopped

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680
rewarding stuff yeah they stopped
 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.580
rewarding stuff yeah they stopped
wanting to talk to regular people and I

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590
wanting to talk to regular people and I
 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.170
wanting to talk to regular people and I
think that contributes to the disconnect

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180
think that contributes to the disconnect
 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.049
think that contributes to the disconnect
that you see between intellectuals and

00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:44.059
that you see between intellectuals and
 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:46.549
that you see between intellectuals and
working-class people and stuff like that

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559
working-class people and stuff like that
 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.650
working-class people and stuff like that
and the other question I had was about

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660
and the other question I had was about
 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.270
and the other question I had was about
okay wait I don't know if that's the

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280
okay wait I don't know if that's the
 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.330
okay wait I don't know if that's the
question I mean I believe there's a

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340
question I mean I believe there's a
 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.130
question I mean I believe there's a
question in there but I question is how

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140
question in there but I question is how
 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.580
question in there but I question is how
do we dress that how should I address it

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590
do we dress that how should I address it
 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.340
do we dress that how should I address it
and is that something that can be

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350
and is that something that can be
 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.049
and is that something that can be
dressed well part of part of the answer

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059
dressed well part of part of the answer
 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.429
dressed well part of part of the answer
to that is that's what the universities

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439
to that is that's what the universities
 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.460
to that is that's what the universities
were for I mean you know not everybody

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470
were for I mean you know not everybody
 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.969
were for I mean you know not everybody
is equipped to or interested in engaging

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979
is equipped to or interested in engaging
 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.190
is equipped to or interested in engaging
in high-level discussion of abstract and

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200
in high-level discussion of abstract and
 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.870
in high-level discussion of abstract and
creative ideas you know you hear this

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880
creative ideas you know you hear this
 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.120
creative ideas you know you hear this
idea that everyone's creative that's a

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130
idea that everyone's creative that's a
 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.390
idea that everyone's creative that's a
lie it's as straightforward as that drew

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400
lie it's as straightforward as that drew
 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.660
lie it's as straightforward as that drew
creativity is very very rare and so and

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670
creativity is very very rare and so and
 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.999
creativity is very very rare and so and
if you happen to be a creative person or

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009
if you happen to be a creative person or
 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.109
if you happen to be a creative person or
if you happen to be someone who's

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119
if you happen to be someone who's
 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.999
if you happen to be someone who's
profoundly interested in ideas you are

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009
profoundly interested in ideas you are
 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.850
profoundly interested in ideas you are
in a pronounced minority just as you are

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860
in a pronounced minority just as you are
 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.140
in a pronounced minority just as you are
if you happen to be extremely

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150
if you happen to be extremely
 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.330
if you happen to be extremely
extroverted or extremely agreeable or

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340
extroverted or extremely agreeable or
 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.010
extroverted or extremely agreeable or
extremely conscientious these are

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020
extremely conscientious these are
 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.319
extremely conscientious these are
minority issues and what you do is you

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329
minority issues and what you do is you
 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.569
minority issues and what you do is you
find like-minded people who are capable

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579
find like-minded people who are capable
 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.539
find like-minded people who are capable
of engaging that we know a heavy weight

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549
of engaging that we know a heavy weight
 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.179
of engaging that we know a heavy weight
with heavy weight weight lifters compete

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189
with heavy weight weight lifters compete
 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.340
with heavy weight weight lifters compete
with heavy weight weight lifters for a

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350
with heavy weight weight lifters for a
 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.080
with heavy weight weight lifters for a
reason and everyone thinks that's fine

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090
reason and everyone thinks that's fine
 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.450
reason and everyone thinks that's fine
the same thing applies to intellectual

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460
the same thing applies to intellectual
 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.550
the same thing applies to intellectual
and creative endeavors so what you do is

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560
and creative endeavors so what you do is
 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.740
and creative endeavors so what you do is
you try to find a community where that's

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750
you try to find a community where that's
 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.359
you try to find a community where that's
that's the nature of the community and

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369
that's the nature of the community and
 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.190
that's the nature of the community and
you likely have to find a relationship

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200
you likely have to find a relationship
 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.089
you likely have to find a relationship
like that as well you know so I don't

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099
like that as well you know so I don't
 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.859
like that as well you know so I don't
think so I think what contributes to the

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869
think so I think what contributes to the
 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.570
think so I think what contributes to the
siloing is the arrogance that goes along

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580
siloing is the arrogance that goes along
 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.820
siloing is the arrogance that goes along
with it because if you're you

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830
with it because if you're you
 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.610
with it because if you're you
you can be interested in ideas and you

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620
you can be interested in ideas and you
 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.740
you can be interested in ideas and you
can be creative well that's the

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750
can be creative well that's the
 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.330
can be creative well that's the
arrogance of the intellect right that's

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340
arrogance of the intellect right that's
 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.860
arrogance of the intellect right that's
the thing the Catholic Church had warned

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870
the thing the Catholic Church had warned
 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.570
the thing the Catholic Church had warned
about for centuries is the arrogance of

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580
about for centuries is the arrogance of
 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.850
about for centuries is the arrogance of
the intellect so because if you're if

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860
the intellect so because if you're if
 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.490
the intellect so because if you're if
you're wise as well as smart and there

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500
you're wise as well as smart and there
 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.410
you're wise as well as smart and there
is no relationship between being smart

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420
is no relationship between being smart
 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:31.970
is no relationship between being smart
and being wise they are not the same

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980
and being wise they are not the same
 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:32.390
and being wise they are not the same
thing

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400
thing
 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.790
thing
there's no quick pathway from smart to

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800
there's no quick pathway from smart to
 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.190
there's no quick pathway from smart to
wise and many of the people who I've

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200
wise and many of the people who I've
 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.800
wise and many of the people who I've
known who were very wise were when some

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810
known who were very wise were when some
 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.600
known who were very wise were when some
of them were intellectually impaired and

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610
of them were intellectually impaired and
 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.540
of them were intellectually impaired and
were still wise you know so it's the

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550
were still wise you know so it's the
 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.460
were still wise you know so it's the
arrogance that brings up the block and I

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470
arrogance that brings up the block and I
 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.290
arrogance that brings up the block and I
see this for example happening in the

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300
see this for example happening in the
 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.330
see this for example happening in the
United States in particular because the

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340
United States in particular because the
 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.920
United States in particular because the
last time I went down there for example

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930
last time I went down there for example
 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.350
last time I went down there for example
I was I had friends down there and and

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360
I was I had friends down there and and
 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.910
I was I had friends down there and and
some of those friends are very very

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920
some of those friends are very very
 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.860
some of those friends are very very
smart people and some of them were

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870
smart people and some of them were
 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.650
smart people and some of them were
talking about the Trump voters and they

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660
talking about the Trump voters and they
 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.210
talking about the Trump voters and they
were talking about the Trump voters with

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220
were talking about the Trump voters with
 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.640
were talking about the Trump voters with
contempt and I thought you better watch

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650
contempt and I thought you better watch
 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.160
contempt and I thought you better watch
that because that's 50% of the damn

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170
that because that's 50% of the damn
 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.740
that because that's 50% of the damn
population and it might be convenient to

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750
population and it might be convenient to
 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.510
population and it might be convenient to
think that they're stupid and beneath

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:11.520
think that they're stupid and beneath
 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.850
think that they're stupid and beneath
you but it's not conducive to a civil

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860
you but it's not conducive to a civil
 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.949
you but it's not conducive to a civil
state and there's no evidence that it's

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959
state and there's no evidence that it's
 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:19.130
state and there's no evidence that it's
true because there isn't a straight line

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140
true because there isn't a straight line
 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.620
true because there isn't a straight line
between intelligent and wise and so I

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630
between intelligent and wise and so I
 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.380
between intelligent and wise and so I
think that if you're if your character

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390
think that if you're if your character
 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.600
think that if you're if your character
is developed and you're intelligent

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610
is developed and you're intelligent
 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:29.090
is developed and you're intelligent
you can have your siloed creative

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100
you can have your siloed creative
 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.400
you can have your siloed creative
community but you develop enough wisdom
