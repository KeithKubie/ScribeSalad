00:00:22.238 --> 00:00:23.730
Hello, science fans.

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.740
Picking your favourite
chromosome is a little bit

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.770
like picking your
favourite child.

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:30.340
Everyone has one, but no one
really admits to it.

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.490
If I had to pick a favourite
chromosome, it would not be

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:34.495
chromosome 18.

00:00:34.495 --> 00:00:38.480
At 76 million base pairs it's
one of the more stunted,

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.980
shrivelled chromosomes
in the human genome.

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.040
And it only harbours around 350
genes, making 18 the least

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.890
dense for genes on chromosomes
in our genome.

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.780
So of those 76 million base
pairs, almost none of it is

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.140
encoding actual genes, and
that's the same across the

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:57.910
whole human genome.

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:00.410
Imagine that these lovely fairy
lights were the whole

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:01.240
human genome.

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:05.176
Well, the coding sections only
account for less than 3%,

00:01:05.176 --> 00:01:07.750
rather like this.

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.000
So what is the rest of
it actually doing?

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.250
Well, lots of it are genetic
control panel switches that

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.130
turn genes on and off, because
they have to come on and off

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.180
at exactly the right time.

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.170
But large parts of the genome
appear to be doing nothing

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:22.120
whatsoever.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.820
We used to call it junk DNA--
the hangover of four billion

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.820
years worth of evolution.

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.600
But there is a difference
between junk, the stuff that

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.790
we keep in the attic that might
have a function, and

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:36.540
rubbish, the stuff that
we throw away.

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.350
And recently we've been
discovering that lots of junk

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.460
might be doing something
after all, although

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.320
we're not sure what.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.750
And that's the reason that we
have to keep on sequencing

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.530
more and more people's genomes,
including crappy, old

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.170
chromosome 18.

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.030
Because I think we're going to
find out that some of that

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.140
junk might be rather useful.

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.670
That's science, folks.

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:57.920
Happy Christmas.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:17.786
