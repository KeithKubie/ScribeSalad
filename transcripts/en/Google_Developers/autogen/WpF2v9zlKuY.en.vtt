device you just like the screen because

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630
device you just like the screen because
 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.880
device you just like the screen because
it has your wallpaper on it great so

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890
it has your wallpaper on it great so
 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:47.960
it has your wallpaper on it great so
let's talk about a kit kat for that for

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970
let's talk about a kit kat for that for
 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.490
let's talk about a kit kat for that for
this the numbering first of all mean

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500
this the numbering first of all mean
 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.889
this the numbering first of all mean
anything in terms of how mutton features

00:01:52.889 --> 00:01:52.899
anything in terms of how mutton features
 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:55.980
anything in terms of how mutton features
this work went into this one it's

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990
this work went into this one it's
 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.109
this work went into this one it's
actually it's exactly point one better

00:01:58.109 --> 00:01:58.119
actually it's exactly point one better
 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:01:59.789
actually it's exactly point one better
than the previous release okay that's a

00:01:59.789 --> 00:01:59.799
than the previous release okay that's a
 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:01.530
than the previous release okay that's a
good start I would say the the

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:01.540
good start I would say the the
 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:03.630
good start I would say the the
distinction on the dot releases correct

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640
distinction on the dot releases correct
 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.730
distinction on the dot releases correct
me if I'm wrong ms API bump so there

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740
me if I'm wrong ms API bump so there
 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.380
me if I'm wrong ms API bump so there
could be some new API so you could take

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390
could be some new API so you could take
 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:08.130
could be some new API so you could take
advantage of

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140
advantage of
 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:09.889
advantage of
if we're not changing the api's

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899
if we're not changing the api's
 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.880
if we're not changing the api's
generally we wouldn't do that it

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890
generally we wouldn't do that it
 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:12.990
generally we wouldn't do that it
wouldn't be more like a maintenance

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000
wouldn't be more like a maintenance
 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.640
wouldn't be more like a maintenance
release on what we've previously done

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650
release on what we've previously done
 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.380
release on what we've previously done
it's a question for marketing engineers

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390
it's a question for marketing engineers
 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.660
it's a question for marketing engineers
we don't decide okay all right next

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670
we don't decide okay all right next
 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.670
we don't decide okay all right next
question we just come up with 6 bugs

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680
question we just come up with 6 bugs
 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.309
question we just come up with 6 bugs
good enough okay fine fair enough uh

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319
good enough okay fine fair enough uh
 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:25.650
good enough okay fine fair enough uh
animation framework is that something

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660
animation framework is that something
 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.070
animation framework is that something
you and what do I even have something

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080
you and what do I even have something
 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.150
you and what do I even have something
like that users demand animations so I

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160
like that users demand animations so I
 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.890
like that users demand animations so I
it's been my personal goal to make

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900
it's been my personal goal to make
 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.830
it's been my personal goal to make
animations almost automatic as far as

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840
animations almost automatic as far as
 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.640
animations almost automatic as far as
they can be so I realize everybody likes

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650
they can be so I realize everybody likes
 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.199
they can be so I realize everybody likes
to think about animations as much as I

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209
to think about animations as much as I
 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.120
to think about animations as much as I
do but they probably don't have the time

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130
do but they probably don't have the time
 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.070
do but they probably don't have the time
to so the more that we can do to make it

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080
to so the more that we can do to make it
 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.509
to so the more that we can do to make it
easy for them I think the better the

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:48.519
easy for them I think the better the
 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:49.470
easy for them I think the better the
animations are going to be in

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480
animations are going to be in
 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.240
animations are going to be in
application so the the main thing that

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250
application so the the main thing that
 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:52.949
application so the the main thing that
we did this time we have all all kinds

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959
we did this time we have all all kinds
 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:54.360
we did this time we have all all kinds
of animation capabilities already but

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370
of animation capabilities already but
 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:55.560
of animation capabilities already but
you have to write a fair amount of code

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570
you have to write a fair amount of code
 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:58.620
you have to write a fair amount of code
to get really good animations we made it

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630
to get really good animations we made it
 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.930
to get really good animations we made it
easier to do transitional and animations

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940
easier to do transitional and animations
 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:02.160
easier to do transitional and animations
in fact it's called the feature is

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170
in fact it's called the feature is
 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.259
in fact it's called the feature is
called transitions and you can basically

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:04.269
called transitions and you can basically
 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:07.710
called transitions and you can basically
say start a transition now change your

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720
say start a transition now change your
 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.020
say start a transition now change your
UI by inflating new layouts or modifying

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030
UI by inflating new layouts or modifying
 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.630
UI by inflating new layouts or modifying
the views that are there and on the next

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640
the views that are there and on the next
 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.430
the views that are there and on the next
frame it will automatically detect what

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440
frame it will automatically detect what
 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:15.990
frame it will automatically detect what
the changes are in the UI and run some

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000
the changes are in the UI and run some
 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.610
the changes are in the UI and run some
sort of automatic animation and that's

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620
sort of automatic animation and that's
 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.090
sort of automatic animation and that's
an API wears a declarative it's it's

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100
an API wears a declarative it's it's
 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.449

tricks on what you can do what tools can
 

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:52.060
tricks on what you can do what tools can
you use in your apps and what can you do

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:52.070
you use in your apps and what can you do
 

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:54.640
you use in your apps and what can you do
to use less memory yourself and very

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:54.650
to use less memory yourself and very
 

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:55.420
