1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,480
I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich.
This is radio lab and this hour,

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:06,090
well the honeymoon's over at Galapagos,

3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:10,050
this is the place where Darwin began to
develop his theory of evolution and it's

4
00:00:10,051 --> 00:00:15,051
the place 170 year or maybe 180 years
later where our producer Tim Howard landed

5
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:18,660
wearing fishnets and a bad
brains tee shirt like to find,

6
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:22,500
to find a very different
landscape than what Darwin saw.

7
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:25,770
And we just told you a story about how
far humans are willing to go to protect

8
00:00:25,771 --> 00:00:27,180
something. This next part,

9
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:31,800
it's about how far we're willing to go
to get something back that we've already

10
00:00:31,801 --> 00:00:36,510
lost to sort of restore a place and
a creature to its quote, wild state.

11
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,890
This story unfolds on one of Galapagos
is most northern islands where they also

12
00:00:40,891 --> 00:00:43,680
had to get rid of some goats.
It's called Pinta. Pinta is,

13
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:46,250
was a very special place.
This is James Gibbs,

14
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:49,320
professor of conservation biology
at the State University of New York.

15
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:53,430
It's one of those islands. It's not
part of any tourist visitation site.

16
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:57,840
So there are no people there. And,
uh, when you set foot first on Pinto,

17
00:00:57,841 --> 00:01:01,930
you immediately sense sure.

18
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:09,953
[inaudible] birds,

19
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:15,120
the problem is on a, things
were spinning out of control,

20
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:18,390
the vegetation was growing wild,

21
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:23,900
the forest was getting overgrown with
the wrong kind of plant and the whole

22
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:27,120
ecosystem was just
teetering out of balance.

23
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:32,300
And one of the reasons for this according
to Linda Coyote is that we had an

24
00:01:32,301 --> 00:01:36,160
island with no tortoises
because tortoises are,

25
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:40,400
are sort of like the lawnmowers, you
know, they, they plow down vegetation,

26
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:44,270
disperse seeds, but for centuries
had been hunted by those whalers.

27
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:48,620
And in about 1906, the
pinto tortoise went extinct.

28
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:53,450
1906, yeah. Little over a hundred years
ago. They don't know the exact date,

29
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,740
but then one evening in March of 1972,

30
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:04,140
Oh yes, this fellow, she h he's
a well known tortoise researcher.

31
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:07,260
He was on Santa Cruz island having
dinner with some friends on regard to

32
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:11,020
chattering about tours. And one of the
people he's eating with says, Hey, uh,

33
00:02:11,021 --> 00:02:15,600
I was recently on Pinna island
collecting snails and I saw this tortoise

34
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:20,680
and I thought, do you know what you
have done the readout for this is

35
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:22,440
the f a hundred years

36
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,140
he and some national park
rangers race out to Pinta

37
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:30,320
and there it was this beautiful
children, one male tortoise,

38
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:34,070
maybe 50 years old. They weren't
sure they'd eventually named Him

39
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:39,650
George Lonesome George. But at the time
the immediate question was of any mole

40
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:44,370
because if they could find a female
for George, then they could, you know,

41
00:02:44,371 --> 00:02:46,530
maybe d extinct the species.

42
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:51,570
So they poked around in the areas where
we got the one and I found a shell of a

43
00:02:53,231 --> 00:02:55,930
female dead animal. Yeah.

44
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,650
Well how had, how had
this female tort died?

45
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:05,740
Uh, someone chopped it in half. No, see
the marks where it was just chopped up.

46
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:11,590
I felt violent. I wanted
to borrow someone's gun.

47
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:13,690
I'd gone kill the person.

48
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:16,780
Everyone held out hopes for just
finding more tortoises back.

49
00:03:16,781 --> 00:03:18,160
James says they kept going back,

50
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:21,400
combing the island with highly
trained tortoise, sniffing dogs.

51
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:25,060
But in the end there was just,
George then shifted the focus on,

52
00:03:25,061 --> 00:03:25,894
now what do we do?

53
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:32,700
We then went to a wolf volcano island
next door and collected two females,

54
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,220
two females that sort of looked like
George but weren't quite the same species.

55
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:40,450
And we put them with George to
see if we could get him to breed.

56
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:44,390
He never did, wasn't interested,
so they thought, hmm,

57
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:46,870
maybe he needs a pinto lady.

58
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:50,590
So now of course there are no female
tortoises on Pinto, but they thought,

59
00:03:50,591 --> 00:03:53,080
you know, maybe a zoo somewhere
or private collection has on,

60
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:56,530
cause you really never know. So they
called around, offered huge cash rewards.

61
00:03:56,531 --> 00:03:58,240
People sent in dozens of tortoises.

62
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:02,800
But Linda took one look at them
and was like, no, no, no, no,

63
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:05,530
they weren't Pintos. So then they thought,

64
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,350
we've got to take matters
into our own hands.

65
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:13,440
Basically what you do is you sit at the
back of the tortoise and first you have

66
00:04:13,441 --> 00:04:16,890
to get to where they'll
allow you to touch them. Um,

67
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:21,030
and eventually you start, um, you know,

68
00:04:21,031 --> 00:04:24,810
fondling their, their legs and tails and,

69
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:29,670
and hoping to get them to ejaculate.
And had a volunteer working with me.

70
00:04:29,671 --> 00:04:31,530
Her name was favorite Greek Joni.

71
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:35,970
She worked with him every other day
or so for a few months and was never

72
00:04:35,971 --> 00:04:37,490
successful. We were, uh,

73
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:42,190
really starting to get kind of
desperate about options and James says,

74
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:45,370
in a way it was a paradox
because on the one hand, awesome,

75
00:04:45,371 --> 00:04:49,000
we have an actual living Pinta island
tortoise, but on the other hand,

76
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:53,200
he might've actually been like the
worst possible candidate for last of his

77
00:04:53,201 --> 00:04:55,630
kind. He seemed to really
like to keep to himself.

78
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,750
He never really liked other tortoises
much. He didn't seem to like that humans.

79
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:02,670
And maybe that's why he
survived. He wasn't curious. Yes.

80
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,750
James says a lot of tortoises
right here, your footsteps,

81
00:05:05,751 --> 00:05:06,800
they raised their heads,

82
00:05:06,801 --> 00:05:10,130
they come out to see what's going
on and then they get whacked. Yeah.

83
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,160
In any case, for about 40 years,

84
00:05:13,161 --> 00:05:16,760
scientists read everything humanly
possible to get loaned some George to meet

85
00:05:16,761 --> 00:05:20,690
with another tortoise so
they could resurrect the
species and bring Pinta island

86
00:05:20,691 --> 00:05:24,320
back to its original
state. Nothing worked.

87
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,133
[inaudible]

88
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:32,380
until one day in July of 2008.

89
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:37,270
George turns to the two female tortoises
that he had been ignoring for years.

90
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:42,470
And he says, doc,

91
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,670
inexplicably, he just suddenly
decides to mate with both of them,

92
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:50,620
each lay eggs.

93
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:54,190
Two clutches were ultimately laid in
his corral and the scientists are like,

94
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:58,100
George got our hopes up dramatically,

95
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:02,210
but they ultimately were in shurtell

96
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:04,343
mother

97
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:08,770
in mid eighties. They were
having a meeting about this.

98
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,750
That's conservation is Josh Donlin again,

99
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,650
whole bunch of herpetologists were out
there and some island conservationists,

100
00:06:14,651 --> 00:06:18,730
and they're talking about what to do Pinta
and they can't get lonesome George to

101
00:06:18,731 --> 00:06:19,600
reproduce,

102
00:06:19,601 --> 00:06:22,870
which are hoping to do because then they
could build a Pinta population and put

103
00:06:22,871 --> 00:06:26,700
it on panels. And he says
that as a meaning wore on,
it got tense. Oh, for sure.

104
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,760
In fact, one guy spoke

105
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:28,600
Harry Green.

106
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,980
I'm a professor of ecology and
evolutionary biology at Cornell University

107
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:35,060
said that at this meeting there was
one guy who just couldn't take it.

108
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,040
Oh, all I remember is him just fuming.

109
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:42,020
He sat there getting more and more
and more frustrated. Then finally,

110
00:06:42,021 --> 00:06:46,760
he just blurted out, shoot
that tortoise and, uh,

111
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,230
quit wasting our time.

112
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:52,060
[inaudible]

113
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,770
because in his view this,

114
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:58,080
the single individual was holding up
this huge conservation [inaudible]

115
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:01,690
and of course the shock was there was
a way went around the room when he said

116
00:07:01,691 --> 00:07:02,524
that.

117
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:07,210
I recall seeing sort of second wave as
the Spanish translation passed around the

118
00:07:07,211 --> 00:07:07,700
room

119
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:10,370
and really what that guy
was specifically saying was,

120
00:07:10,371 --> 00:07:13,090
don't be precious as a tourist,
as a tourist is a tortoise.

121
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:16,930
Let's just take some tortoises from a
nearby island and put them back on Pinto,

122
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:21,060
but there's a much bigger question
here that goes way beyond gloves,

123
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,910
which is basically like what is
the right way to protect nature?

124
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:32,130
Now people are right now throwing beers
at each other around what is the right

125
00:07:32,621 --> 00:07:33,454
strategy.

126
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,830
Josh says that there are basically two
camps right now on the one side you've

127
00:07:38,831 --> 00:07:43,270
got this classic like what you might
call Eden approach conservation biology.

128
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:48,220
It's foundation is this idea of pristine
wilderness from the very beginning.

129
00:07:48,221 --> 00:07:51,190
I think all of us, well, I can't
speak for other people but,

130
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:56,240
but you always have this idea of wanting
to get it back to some kind of pre

131
00:07:57,751 --> 00:08:01,090
human condition. Every human
being. The operative word and,

132
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,500
and if you think about it, we
all have this, we all have this,

133
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:07,580
this picture of what we want to bring it
all back to, you know, it might be like

134
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:14,680
the planes just covered with buffalo or
maybe the Serengeti desert with lions

135
00:08:17,091 --> 00:08:19,160
and elephants, or maybe it's
10,000 hammerhead sharks,

136
00:08:19,161 --> 00:08:22,970
but whatever the scene is
that just doesn't have any
people but is carrying that

137
00:08:22,971 --> 00:08:27,290
idea, those pictures of your
head even like useful anymore.

138
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:31,670
It's like so Sanuk no, but it
just seems so unrealistic. Right?

139
00:08:31,671 --> 00:08:32,870
But I mean in the bigger picture,

140
00:08:32,871 --> 00:08:37,040
you can make the argument that humans
now affect every square meter of the

141
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:40,580
earth. There's no place, no
matter how remote we get,

142
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:44,810
you can go to the North Pole. It's
been affected by human activity.

143
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:49,040
You can go, I don't know, the
depths of the impenetrable jungle.

144
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:50,930
It's been affected by human activity.

145
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:54,420
That's how they dream is
she's an environmental law
professor at the Berkeley

146
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:58,140
School of law in you're
radically remaking the world.

147
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:01,320
And the question is
what's our responsibility?

148
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:03,330
And it brings us to our
second school of thought,

149
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:08,070
which in its most extreme version
goes something like this. We're God,

150
00:09:08,071 --> 00:09:13,071
we might as well get good at it and
we're going to have to create these

151
00:09:14,521 --> 00:09:19,080
ecosystems based on our best science.

152
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:24,140
And you could argue we're going to have
to get a whole lot better at making some

153
00:09:24,271 --> 00:09:27,050
very, very difficult decisions. Climate

154
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:32,300
change seems to mean that a lot
of species are pretty much doomed,

155
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:40,820
30% 40% 50% of the species now on
the planet in a few decades maybe

156
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:46,530
disappearing. And this is what I think
is really the tough question now,

157
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:51,800
is if we can seed that we can't
any longer save all the species,

158
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:58,530
then does that put us in the situation
of having to decide which ones will save

159
00:09:58,531 --> 00:09:59,550
and which ones we won't?

160
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:03,420
And do we have any basis for making
those kinds of decisions? Hmm.

161
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:08,040
So you're saying that the, that the,
let's go back to when it was good.

162
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:12,690
Let's go back to a better
time. That's just silly.

163
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:16,590
I didn't say it was silly. Okay. What
did you yeah, I said it was impossible.

164
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:21,830
Things might not be silly.
They might not be stupid ideas,

165
00:10:21,831 --> 00:10:23,570
but we still might not be able to do them.

166
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:25,100
[inaudible]

167
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:29,510
okay, so here's um, a wood plaque.

168
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:34,850
It says lonesome George is the last
survivor of the dynasty of land.

169
00:10:34,851 --> 00:10:39,851
Tortoise is from Pinta island and in fact
in 2012 after decades of trying to get

170
00:10:41,451 --> 00:10:43,040
him to to breed

171
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:45,123
[inaudible]

172
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:45,561
lonesome,

173
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:50,561
George Dies r I p 24th of June,

174
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:54,320
2012 and the panda tortoise when extinct.

175
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:58,490
So damn case in point, I
guess. No, going back. Yeah,

176
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:03,380
I mean that's what I thought. But then
I spoke with this woman. Hello? Hello.

177
00:11:03,381 --> 00:11:04,880
Just hello? Do you hear me? Yes, I do.

178
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:09,830
Who kind of scrambled everything up for
me? Can I get you to introduce yourself?

179
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:12,470
Yes. My name is [inaudible].

180
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:16,310
I am a senior research scientist at
Yale University and just tell us,

181
00:11:16,311 --> 00:11:19,760
come up with kind of a radical
idea. I call it the Phoenix project.

182
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:21,440
Here's the backstory.

183
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:26,440
In the mid nineties we started in 94
to Cielo and some folks from their

184
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:26,540
Galapagos National Park.

185
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:31,340
They began taking a census of all the
tortoises in the Galapagos population of

186
00:11:31,341 --> 00:11:34,610
tortoises on all the islands. They were
going to do this big population studies.

187
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:35,930
So they went island by island,

188
00:11:35,931 --> 00:11:38,150
took a little bit of blood from
all these different tortoises,

189
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:43,450
did a genetic analysis and old pla
found something they never expected.

190
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,000
A group of tortoise is not on
Pinta that had a lot of Pinta DNA.

191
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:54,190
I remember very clearly that
moment was very, very, it's like,

192
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:56,660
yes, look at this. Yeah.

193
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,540
Wait, you're saying this Pinta DNA was
on a nother island? Yeah. None on Pinta.

194
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:04,930
No. Well, how would that happen?
Um, we don't think it was natural.

195
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:09,880
Gisella thinks it might've
been the whalers, either
the whalers or the pirates,

196
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:10,151
you know,

197
00:12:10,151 --> 00:12:13,810
because like we talked about in the
1718 hundreds these whalers would come

198
00:12:13,811 --> 00:12:16,420
along, grab a bunch of
tortoises, put them on the ship,

199
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:18,780
and then they would hunt
for whales or shoot.

200
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:22,400
And sometimes when they were done in the,

201
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:26,530
the ship was filled with whale
products. There's no room down here.

202
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,750
They throw a few extra
towards his overboard,

203
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,010
say a few from Pinta.

204
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:36,460
Maybe those pins does tortoises swim
with occurrence to that nearby island set

205
00:12:36,461 --> 00:12:40,770
up a little ex-pat community and
started breeding with the locals.

206
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,900
That's our working hypothesis,

207
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:46,420
which brings us to [inaudible] her idea.

208
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:53,720
You know on average 50% of your genome
comes from your mom and 50% from your

209
00:12:54,031 --> 00:12:55,530
dad, but it's an average.

210
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:57,720
So just sell a thought. Just by chance.

211
00:12:57,721 --> 00:13:00,930
Some of these tortoises are going to have
a little bit more Pinta DNA from their

212
00:13:00,931 --> 00:13:03,390
Pinta ancestors than others. Yes.

213
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:06,810
So what if we took those
tortoises and bred them together?

214
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:11,240
So back then for the next generation
so that you can give a push to this

215
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,380
process.

216
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:16,130
She says, if we keep doing this, taking
the babies with the most Pinta DNA,

217
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:19,660
breeding them together slowly, surely

218
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:24,510
in four generations you could have
90% of the painter genome restored.

219
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:29,190
Really? Yeah. But that's four
generations of tortoises,

220
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:31,350
not rats, which means at
least a hundred years.

221
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:33,890
But in the meantime,

222
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:38,510
the vegetation on Pinta is growing out
of control from an ecological point of

223
00:13:38,511 --> 00:13:42,980
view. Pinta can't wait. So in
2009 they come up with a stop gap.

224
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:48,050
They take 39 tortoises raised in captivity
and they use them as placeholders.

225
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:53,050
They sterilize them and put them
on Pinta. Really? One day. Yeah.

226
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:56,540
Well these are very purest
sort of visions. Yeah.

227
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:59,800
They sterilize and 39 of them. They're
just basically the lawn mowers.

228
00:13:59,801 --> 00:14:00,160
They're not.

229
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:04,930
Exactly and they put them on Pinta and
they're just chomping away right now.

230
00:14:04,931 --> 00:14:08,770
They're living at their lives
really happily on Pinta you know,

231
00:14:08,771 --> 00:14:10,120
until the originals that ready.

232
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,050
Now Linda says in the end
you don't actually need to
do the full aggressive for

233
00:14:16,051 --> 00:14:18,540
generation breeding thing.
You can just take, I'm Jeff,

234
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:21,990
I'm Jad Abumrad I'm Robert
Krulwich Radiolab and this hour,

235
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:24,540
well the honeymoon's over glove vagus.

236
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:28,530
This is the place where Darwin began to
develop his theory of evolution and its

237
00:14:28,531 --> 00:14:29,960
the place 170 year,

238
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:35,060
maybe 180 years later where our producer
Tim Howard landed wearing fishnets in a

239
00:14:35,551 --> 00:14:40,320
bad brains tee shirt like to fight to
find a very different landscape than what

240
00:14:40,321 --> 00:14:41,070
Darwin saw.

241
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:44,250
And we just told you a story about how
far humans are willing to go to protect

242
00:14:44,251 --> 00:14:45,660
something. This next part,

243
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:50,310
it's about how far we're willing to go
to get something back that we've already

244
00:14:50,311 --> 00:14:55,010
lost to sort of restore a place in
a creature to its quote, wild state.

245
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:59,390
This story unfolds on one of Galapagos
is most northern islands where they also

246
00:14:59,391 --> 00:15:00,320
had to get rid of some goats.

247
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:04,730
It's called Pinta Pinta as was a very
special place. This is James Gibbs,

248
00:15:04,731 --> 00:15:07,790
professor of conservation biology
at the State University of New York.

249
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:11,900
It's a one of those islands. It's not
part of any tourist visitation site.

250
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:16,340
So there are no people there. And
uh, when you set foot first on Pinto,

251
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:20,870
you immediately sense sheer abundance.

252
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:30,503
[inaudible]

253
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:32,810
problem is on Penna. Things
were spinning out of [inaudible]

254
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:33,663
control.

255
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:36,880
The vegetation was growing wild,

256
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:42,390
the forest was getting overgrown with
the wrong kind of plant and the whole

257
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:42,720
[inaudible]

258
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,670
it goes system was just
teetering out of balance.

259
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,700
And one of the reasons for this,

260
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:52,460
according to Linda Coyote is that we
had an island with no tortoises. Yes.

261
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,480
Because tortoises are sort of like
the lawnmowers, you know, they,

262
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:00,320
they plow down vegetation, disperse seeds,

263
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:02,780
but for centuries had been
hunted by those whalers,

264
00:16:02,781 --> 00:16:07,100
and in about 1906 the pinta
tortoise went extinct.

265
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:11,900
1906 yeah, a little over a hundred years
ago. They don't know the exact date,

266
00:16:11,901 --> 00:16:16,230
date, but then one
evening in March of 1972.
