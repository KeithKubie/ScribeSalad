00:00:20.796 --> 00:00:21.720
PROFESSOR: Okay.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.020
So this is our second
session with Phil

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:26.550
[? Scarf, ?] please welcome him.

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:32.630
So we're going to have
our presentations based

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:36.210
on the design assignment
that Phil came up with.

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.740
So who would like
to go for first?

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:47.755
There you go.

00:00:47.755 --> 00:00:48.255
Thank you.

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:59.550
PHIL SCARF: Can you
tell us your design?

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.600
STUDENT 1: So we chose a raga.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.740
We decided on the notes
C, Db, F, G and Bb.

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:16.900
And we went with a
more traditional,

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:23.580
where you start out slow and
you slowly expand the range.

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.635
And then you add in
more players and then

00:01:25.635 --> 00:01:29.750
you play a melody line together
and then alternate whoever

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.870
is improvising.

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:36.092
And then we did a little
bit of extrapolation

00:01:36.092 --> 00:01:38.873
halfway through by
changing one of the notes

00:01:38.873 --> 00:01:42.040
in the raga actually.

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.760
And just for a little different
style and then we go back.

00:02:16.477 --> 00:05:32.108
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:05:32.108 --> 00:05:35.170
PHIL SCARF: That
was very impressive.

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:38.750
So let me just ask
the performers.

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:42.240
Did that performance go the
way you envisioned it going?

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.070
Since we're
improvising, you never

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:46.319
know what's going to happen
when you improvise, right?

00:05:46.319 --> 00:05:48.740
So I'm just curious
if that's the way

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:52.037
you had planned for it to go,
or you thought that anything

00:05:52.037 --> 00:05:53.120
might have been different.

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.455
STUDENT 1: So when
I was describing it

00:05:54.455 --> 00:05:56.012
I said there was
a section where we

00:05:56.012 --> 00:05:58.310
change one of the
notes in the raga.

00:05:58.310 --> 00:05:59.154
That didn't happen.

00:06:02.607 --> 00:06:05.148
At the end, we had the option
of going into that or stopping.

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:12.430
PHIL SCARF: Anything else?

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:16.300
STUDENT 2: So we sort of knew
vaguely what different sections

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:17.940
were going to be
like, and sort of what

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:20.992
we would try and do with them.

00:06:20.992 --> 00:06:23.700
But that was completely
different -- like, we tried,

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:26.670
we run through it a couple
of times before, today.

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:30.630
That was kind of different
to what we'd done before.

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:32.632
PHIL SCARF: That's
improvisation.

00:06:32.632 --> 00:06:33.590
It should be different.

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:34.610
That's actually the point.

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:35.270
It should be different.

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:36.840
If you start doing the same
thing over and over again,

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:38.990
it's no longer
improvisation, right?

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:39.670
So that's great.

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:40.944
Good.

00:06:40.944 --> 00:06:42.360
So any comments
from anybody else?

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:47.915
Any thoughts?

00:06:47.915 --> 00:06:49.540
STUDENT 3: There were
a couple of times

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:53.020
when you played in unison,
and I didn't really

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:56.066
see any cues into
those sections.

00:06:56.066 --> 00:06:59.090
I was just wondering if you were
all improvising, how did you

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:03.316
move from improvisational
section to unison section?

00:07:03.316 --> 00:07:05.796
STUDENT 4: We have this
one particular melody,

00:07:05.796 --> 00:07:11.403
so when one person started, we
could recognize that melody.

00:07:11.403 --> 00:07:13.236
Or one person began it,
we would go into it.

00:07:13.236 --> 00:07:14.972
And there was a couple
times we repeated it,

00:07:14.972 --> 00:07:16.708
so one person would
get to the end of it

00:07:16.708 --> 00:07:18.692
and then we'd go
straight into it again.

00:07:25.209 --> 00:07:26.500
PHIL SCARF: Any other comments?

00:07:31.033 --> 00:07:32.491
PROFESSOR: I'll
just say, I thought

00:07:32.491 --> 00:07:36.915
it worked very well as a
composed improvisation.

00:07:36.915 --> 00:07:39.060
I thought the framework
was well thought out.

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:41.390
And the realization
through improvisation

00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:43.007
made a lot of sense.

00:07:43.007 --> 00:07:43.981
Very good.

00:07:46.903 --> 00:07:49.270
PHIL SCARF: I think you
really captured the frameworks

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:50.896
very well.

00:07:50.896 --> 00:07:52.520
Why don't you want
to tell us about it?

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:55.100
Because everybody needs to know.

00:07:55.100 --> 00:08:04.773
STUDENT 4: So basically we
came up with our own scale

00:08:04.773 --> 00:08:07.270
to base the improvisation on.

00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:13.220
And we decided to look into
the range and note density

00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:15.340
frameworks at first.

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:18.330
So we're each starting
in different parts

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:22.580
of our register, which is
maybe different than what

00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:26.024
would be done
traditionally, perhaps.

00:08:26.024 --> 00:08:30.315
But then we'll move
out and expand,

00:08:30.315 --> 00:08:32.898
which is pretty similar to some
of the stuff that happens with

00:08:32.898 --> 00:08:35.844
[INAUDIBLE].

00:08:35.844 --> 00:08:40.480
And then we'll also be moving
from pretty simple melodies

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:45.135
and pretty simple [INAUDIBLE]
to more complicated things

00:08:45.135 --> 00:08:48.320
that come up and we'll
try to then [INAUDIBLE].

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:50.280
It won't start with
a [INAUDIBLE] rhythm,

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:53.220
but then we'll try to get into
a rhythmic groove later on.

00:08:56.562 --> 00:08:59.020
STUDENT 6: One more thing, I'm
going to start with a drone,

00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:02.004
to imitate the
tambura, and we're

00:09:02.004 --> 00:09:03.795
going to add ornamentation
to the melodies,

00:09:03.795 --> 00:09:05.290
to imitate [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:09.696
PHIL SCARF: OK, sounds good.

00:09:09.696 --> 00:12:24.994
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:12:24.994 --> 00:12:25.702
PHIL SCARF: Nice.

00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:35.490
So any thoughts
about that piece?

00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:44.590
So did the performance
went the way you expected?

00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:48.184
Did you do anything different
that you were thinking about?

00:12:48.184 --> 00:12:51.076
STUDENT 6: I'd say in general,
the note density and range

00:12:51.076 --> 00:12:53.970
[INAUDIBLE].

00:12:53.970 --> 00:12:59.089
We were hoping to get a motif
in there, but I don't think --

00:12:59.089 --> 00:13:02.071
STUDENT 5: We were going to
just let it develop organically.

00:13:02.071 --> 00:13:06.050
But we just kind of
played off each other.

00:13:06.050 --> 00:13:10.879
STUDENT 6: And the rhythm wasn't
3-3-2 like we were predicting,

00:13:10.879 --> 00:13:13.750
it did settle.

00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:17.540
PHIL SCARF: Yeah, it did
become rhythmic, about halfway

00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:19.680
through.

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:20.470
Yeah, good.

00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:21.166
Anything else?

00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:29.450
[INAUDIBLE]

00:13:29.450 --> 00:13:30.950
STUDENT 5: Yeah, a
little bit, yeah.

00:13:30.950 --> 00:13:32.782
PROFESSOR: And then
you jump right on.

00:13:32.782 --> 00:13:35.028
STUDENT 6: Well yeah, I
used the bass to really --

00:13:37.097 --> 00:13:38.930
PROFESSOR: But that was
very good listening,

00:13:38.930 --> 00:13:41.590
because it didn't take
more than a second or two

00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:44.440
to really coalesce.

00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:45.980
And how about the ending?

00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:48.900
Had that been thought about?

00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:51.120
STUDENT 5: We
planned to just bring

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:53.618
the range back in,
basically, to where

00:13:53.618 --> 00:13:55.034
we had been in the beginning.

00:13:58.810 --> 00:14:01.790
That fade-out,
literally fade out.

00:14:06.162 --> 00:14:07.680
PHIL SCARF: That
worked out great.

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:09.030
Anybody else have any comments?

00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:10.155
Any thoughts, observations?

00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:16.680
Yeah.

00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:18.880
STUDENT 7: Well
in the beginning,

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:21.020
I thought the piano
player was going

00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:24.023
to drone on for the entire song,
and just sort of be a drone.

00:14:24.023 --> 00:14:25.564
And I was waiting
for him to come in,

00:14:25.564 --> 00:14:28.916
and finally I felt
relieved when he

00:14:28.916 --> 00:14:31.642
came in and built on the violin.

00:14:34.369 --> 00:14:35.035
PHIL SCARF: Yeah

00:14:35.035 --> 00:14:37.810
STUDENT 6: Yeah, we didn't have
any unison melodies planned,

00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:40.880
so I didn't want it to be
really dense too early.

00:14:43.070 --> 00:14:45.320
PHIL SCARF: I mean, I thought
that was nice, you know?

00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:48.770
Because we had one solo voice
with a kind of accompaniment,

00:14:48.770 --> 00:14:51.840
and then it became
more of a duet.

00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:56.068
So there was an element
of progression there.

00:14:56.068 --> 00:14:58.036
STUDENT 6: Another thing
we didn't anticipate,

00:14:58.036 --> 00:15:02.464
Austin focused on the
mid-upper part of the scale,

00:15:02.464 --> 00:15:05.270
and I was just doing the
first three or four notes.

00:15:17.107 --> 00:15:18.190
PHIL SCARF: Anything else?

00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:24.110
Cool.

00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:24.610
OK.

00:15:24.610 --> 00:15:25.294
Next group.

00:15:25.294 --> 00:15:27.710
STUDENT 8: So I actually didn't
come up with my own scale.

00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:29.863
I just decided to use
the D Dorian mode.

00:15:32.689 --> 00:15:35.990
It's a little bit more humble
for me to play around with.

00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:43.222
My vision is around the piano to
form a sort of drone, in low D.

00:15:43.222 --> 00:15:47.667
And use that, and also drone,
and then as a little bit goes

00:15:47.667 --> 00:15:54.563
on, build up into a [INAUDIBLE]
[INAUDIBLE] necessary.

00:15:54.563 --> 00:15:57.509
It starts at
[INAUDIBLE] but then

00:15:57.509 --> 00:16:01.487
I do have a melodic motif that
I was going to center it around.

00:16:10.541 --> 00:16:12.540
PHIL SCARF: Can I just
ask, is the melodic thing

00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:15.270
a raga or scale idea?

00:16:15.270 --> 00:16:18.380
STUDENT 8: I just came up
with something on the guitar.

00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:20.380
PHIL SCARF: So are there
any specific frameworks

00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:24.170
from the set of 12
that we're using here?

00:16:24.170 --> 00:16:27.916
STUDENT 8: I was looking
at -- I can't remember --

00:16:27.916 --> 00:16:30.411
there were two [INAUDIBLE]
I was looking at.

00:16:30.411 --> 00:16:32.910
Looking at a little
bit no density.

00:16:32.910 --> 00:16:37.030
Kind of applying it towards the
[INAUDIBLE] notes, or the lower

00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:37.530
end.

00:16:37.530 --> 00:16:40.347
So the drone has a
little bit of freedom,

00:16:40.347 --> 00:16:42.430
in terms of picking up,
as he wants to [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:45.554
tremolo, rhythmic
framework, I guess.

00:16:45.554 --> 00:16:46.970
PHIL SCARF: So is
the note density

00:16:46.970 --> 00:16:49.640
going to change
throughout the piece?

00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:50.290
Or not?

00:16:50.290 --> 00:16:51.290
Yes.

00:16:51.290 --> 00:16:53.324
Do you have a view of
how that would change?

00:16:53.324 --> 00:16:54.740
Or is that going
to be improvised?

00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:57.720
STUDENT 8: I envisioned it as
starting out slow, building up,

00:16:57.720 --> 00:17:01.256
more dense, little faster,
slowing down towards the end.

00:17:05.585 --> 00:17:10.520
And the other one I was looking
at was using the framework,

00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:17.370
the little melody, I guess,
and working that around --

00:17:17.370 --> 00:17:18.977
I can't remember
what it was called --

00:17:18.977 --> 00:17:20.560
PHIL SCARF: Oh, the
[INAUDIBLE] maybe?

00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:21.435
That's what you mean?

00:17:21.435 --> 00:17:22.099
Melodic motif.

00:17:22.099 --> 00:17:22.599
Yeah.

00:17:22.599 --> 00:17:24.879
Yeah.

00:17:24.879 --> 00:17:25.379
Good.

00:17:31.716 --> 00:18:08.070
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:20:51.892 --> 00:20:52.600
PHIL SCARF: Yeah.

00:20:56.337 --> 00:20:56.920
That was good.

00:21:00.290 --> 00:21:01.130
I like that amp.

00:21:01.130 --> 00:21:02.345
That's pretty convenient.

00:21:21.010 --> 00:21:23.240
So any comments
from the performers?

00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:27.100
I'm particularly interested
in what the collaborators may

00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:28.850
think about this,
since they didn't have

00:21:28.850 --> 00:21:34.944
much notice before
playing the piece.

00:21:34.944 --> 00:21:36.527
STUDENT 9: I didn't
have any idea what

00:21:36.527 --> 00:21:37.818
it would be like going into it.

00:21:37.818 --> 00:21:40.080
But having the
framework really set

00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:42.405
an expectation of
gradually increasing

00:21:42.405 --> 00:21:44.265
note density and the range.

00:21:44.265 --> 00:21:45.985
And having the motif
definitely helps.

00:21:45.985 --> 00:21:47.470
PHIL SCARF: That motif was cool.

00:21:47.470 --> 00:21:50.280
And the way that it
was used was good.

00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:53.465
STUDENT 10: I think it
was just enough to provide

00:21:53.465 --> 00:21:57.730
a cool little phrase to work on.

00:21:57.730 --> 00:22:00.470
STUDENT 8: That was one
of the visions I had.

00:22:00.470 --> 00:22:01.660
PHIL SCARF: Yeah.

00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:03.390
That was great.

00:22:03.390 --> 00:22:07.136
The first group that's used
the [? chellan ?] framework,

00:22:07.136 --> 00:22:09.434
so that's good.

00:22:09.434 --> 00:22:10.225
Any other comments?

00:22:10.225 --> 00:22:13.152
What about the designer?

00:22:13.152 --> 00:22:16.700
Do you have any comments
about how this went?

00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:19.330
STUDENT 8: I just didn't know
what to expect going into it.

00:22:19.330 --> 00:22:23.730
Because again, I just sort of
did this myself, yesterday.

00:22:23.730 --> 00:22:26.900
And I didn't know
what the performers

00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:28.280
would think going into this.

00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:35.140
And from the outset, I
knew, I guess the piano

00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:38.550
sort of provided the
rhythmic background, I guess.

00:22:38.550 --> 00:22:40.610
And set the overall tone.

00:22:40.610 --> 00:22:43.300
And then I came in
with some free time

00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:44.790
before I settled into the motif.

00:22:44.790 --> 00:22:46.806
And then everybody settled
around that, as well.

00:22:49.799 --> 00:22:51.590
PHIL SCARF: Anybody
else have any thoughts?

00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:52.760
Observations, comments?

00:22:55.749 --> 00:22:57.290
STUDENT 7: I really
liked that motif.

00:22:57.290 --> 00:22:59.040
It really brought
it all together.

00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:02.850
And I think it gave
the collaborators

00:23:02.850 --> 00:23:05.450
a really solid
base to start from.

00:23:05.450 --> 00:23:08.325
And build off of.

00:23:08.325 --> 00:23:11.250
Seems like a cool way
improvise and make a framework.

00:23:11.250 --> 00:23:13.602
Just start with a tiny
motif and then see

00:23:13.602 --> 00:23:15.247
where you can take
it from there.

00:23:15.247 --> 00:23:16.080
PHIL SCARF: Exactly.

00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:18.970
And then, the listener also
gravitates towards that,

00:23:18.970 --> 00:23:19.570
as well.

00:23:19.570 --> 00:23:23.810
Every time it comes back,
it's familiar material.

00:23:23.810 --> 00:23:28.170
In fact, I think that
kind of illustrates one

00:23:28.170 --> 00:23:31.350
of the attractive elements
of Indian classical music

00:23:31.350 --> 00:23:33.370
is use of [? chellan ?].

00:23:33.370 --> 00:23:35.630
Even if it's something
you haven't heard before,

00:23:35.630 --> 00:23:37.710
by the time you
finish hearing it,

00:23:37.710 --> 00:23:40.334
you've heard the [? chellan, ?]
some of the key phrases, you've

00:23:40.334 --> 00:23:44.000
heard them so many times,
it become familiar.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.930
So like this motif, by
the time we finished,

00:23:46.930 --> 00:23:48.320
it sounds like a familiar piece.

00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:50.111
Even though none of us
had heard it before,

00:23:50.111 --> 00:23:51.355
except perhaps, the composer.

00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:55.060
So it's nice.

00:23:55.060 --> 00:23:57.689
Any other thoughts?

00:23:57.689 --> 00:23:58.730
So what's your framework?

00:23:58.730 --> 00:24:00.540
Can you tell us
about your framework?

00:24:00.540 --> 00:24:05.400
STUDENT 11: OK, so basically,
we based off a [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:12.270
in terms of -- we have a
motif that we start out with.

00:24:12.270 --> 00:24:16.670
And then we're going
late on build on it

00:24:16.670 --> 00:24:18.240
by adding some chords.

00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:20.262
And then while one
person plays the melody,

00:24:20.262 --> 00:24:22.230
the other person will
improvise on it, instead.

00:24:28.066 --> 00:24:31.000
STUDENT 12: We had
wanted a beat to feed us.

00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:42.111
He'll learn it.

00:24:42.111 --> 00:24:42.736
STUDENT 11: OK.

00:24:42.736 --> 00:24:47.150
You'll get the melody
after we play it.

00:24:47.150 --> 00:24:50.588
So basically, us
two will play it,

00:24:50.588 --> 00:24:57.012
and then you can come in
after four times or something.

00:24:57.012 --> 00:24:58.470
And then we'll take
turns improving

00:24:58.470 --> 00:25:12.876
while one person drones on a D.

00:25:12.876 --> 00:28:18.760
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:20.970
PHIL SCARF: So any thoughts?

00:28:20.970 --> 00:28:22.280
How did you think it went?

00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:24.200
STUDENT 11: I think
it went pretty well.

00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:26.476
I think originally we were
supposed to play the melody

00:28:26.476 --> 00:28:28.059
and then harmonize
a little bit to it.

00:28:28.059 --> 00:28:29.970
And then kind of stretch
up from that melody.

00:28:29.970 --> 00:28:32.095
But in the end, we just
started improvising instead

00:28:32.095 --> 00:28:35.770
so I guess that worked out.

00:28:35.770 --> 00:28:37.830
PHIL SCARF: But there
was harmony introduced

00:28:37.830 --> 00:28:41.100
as the improvisation
evolved, too.

00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:43.910
It's coo.

00:28:43.910 --> 00:28:45.910
Any other comments or thoughts?

00:28:45.910 --> 00:28:47.785
How about the flutist?

00:28:47.785 --> 00:28:49.910
STUDENT 1: I was playing
in F natural for too long.

00:28:53.830 --> 00:28:57.750
I was like there's probably
not an F# in this scale

00:28:57.750 --> 00:29:02.150
if there's a Bb,
[INAUDIBLE] really confused.

00:29:02.150 --> 00:29:02.650
[INAUDIBLE]

00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:13.288
PHIL SCARF: Anybody
else, have any comments?

00:29:13.288 --> 00:29:15.276
STUDENT 2: I thought
it was pretty cool how

00:29:15.276 --> 00:29:20.743
the rhythmic moment
of the melody

00:29:20.743 --> 00:29:22.731
became stronger
almost, throughout.

00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:27.955
It was like a little more
free in the beginning,

00:29:27.955 --> 00:29:30.672
maybe, when you
decided to push time.

00:29:30.672 --> 00:29:36.600
[INAUDIBLE] almost
like a very driving.

00:29:39.564 --> 00:29:41.046
PHIL SCARF: That's true.

00:29:41.046 --> 00:29:44.030
Good observation.

00:29:44.030 --> 00:29:47.730
It was very effective, too.

00:29:47.730 --> 00:29:49.952
PROFESSOR: So that's the
second one that did that.

00:29:49.952 --> 00:29:53.848
Where it evolved into
the rhythmic spectrum.

00:29:53.848 --> 00:29:57.340
It's an interesting
way to do it.

00:29:57.340 --> 00:30:00.576
STUDENT 13: So this
is D Mixolydian

00:30:00.576 --> 00:30:03.470
rather than picking a new scale.

00:30:03.470 --> 00:30:07.290
And [INAUDIBLE] Jamie
is going to set up

00:30:07.290 --> 00:30:10.930
a low drone at the beginning.

00:30:10.930 --> 00:30:14.320
And once Jamie has
this low drone,

00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:19.307
the flute and trumpet come
in on vibrato type lines.

00:30:19.307 --> 00:30:20.890
And then the flute
and trumpet explore

00:30:20.890 --> 00:30:21.973
the different [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:21.973 --> 00:30:25.785
So I tried it in a low
range, [INAUDIBLE] Flute

00:30:25.785 --> 00:30:28.340
is going to start
with low note density

00:30:28.340 --> 00:30:30.032
and gradually increase density.

00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:40.880
Also Jamie is going to gradually
adopt a rhythmic progression

00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:44.380
and eventually start playing
[? jala. ?] And I think you

00:30:44.380 --> 00:30:47.450
said the [? jala ?] will be
in different rhythmic groups,

00:30:47.450 --> 00:30:50.490
so that we also have a
little bit of [? livhari ?],

00:30:50.490 --> 00:30:52.860
or rhythm play.

00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:55.100
And that will go on
for a minute or two.

00:30:55.100 --> 00:30:56.766
We don't really have
specifics of what's

00:30:56.766 --> 00:30:59.360
going to happen in there,
it's just to improvise.

00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:03.004
And at the end, I drop
out, flute drops out,

00:31:03.004 --> 00:31:05.170
and then Jamie just sort
of continues with the drone

00:31:05.170 --> 00:31:06.414
and fades out.

00:31:06.414 --> 00:33:35.662
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:33:35.662 --> 00:33:36.370
PHIL SCARF: Nice.

00:33:40.753 --> 00:33:43.326
So do we have any thoughts
from the performers?

00:33:46.820 --> 00:33:48.820
STUDENT 7: I thought
it went pretty well.

00:33:48.820 --> 00:33:50.910
We just sort of set up
the framework last night

00:33:50.910 --> 00:33:52.284
and just ran through it once.

00:33:52.284 --> 00:33:54.450
We were like, alright, we'll
do something like that.

00:33:54.450 --> 00:33:57.540
So it turned out similar manner.

00:33:57.540 --> 00:34:00.926
Had sort of the same feel.

00:34:00.926 --> 00:34:03.501
I think it went well.

00:34:03.501 --> 00:34:05.850
STUDENT 13: I don't think it
sounded quite as Hindustani

00:34:05.850 --> 00:34:08.560
as a raja, but was totally
using the framework.

00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:10.790
Like it had the
same idea, and it

00:34:10.790 --> 00:34:13.540
was easy to communicate
with someone

00:34:13.540 --> 00:34:18.052
who just heard the
framework today, what to do.

00:34:18.052 --> 00:34:20.280
PROFESSOR: I like the
rhythmic of the banjo.

00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:25.429
You really sounded almost
like a mix between a tabla

00:34:25.429 --> 00:34:27.996
and something, I'm
not quite what else.

00:34:27.996 --> 00:34:30.750
STUDENT 7: Yeah, I almost
wanted to play it on my lap.

00:34:30.750 --> 00:34:31.889
PHIL SCARF: Maybe more
like a [? surod, ?]

00:34:31.889 --> 00:34:33.763
actually it's a little
like it's [? surod, ?]

00:34:33.763 --> 00:34:39.510
which is played with a pick
and it's got more of an attack.

00:34:39.510 --> 00:34:42.050
Cool.

00:34:42.050 --> 00:34:43.414
How about the flutist?

00:34:43.414 --> 00:34:44.830
Because this is
the first time you

00:34:44.830 --> 00:34:46.854
had been introduced
to the piece.

00:34:46.854 --> 00:34:49.035
Any comments?

00:34:49.035 --> 00:34:52.089
STUDENT 1: I liked it,
it was easy to follow.

00:34:52.089 --> 00:34:54.005
[INAUDIBLE] set up the
right image [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:59.074 --> 00:35:00.740
PROFESSOR: You're a
utility [INAUDIBLE],

00:35:00.740 --> 00:35:02.239
we bring you in
whenever we need it.

00:35:04.810 --> 00:35:06.092
Thank you for that.

00:35:06.092 --> 00:35:07.800
PHIL SCARF: I was
going to say, I thought

00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:11.320
it was cool because the way
you used the frameworks,

00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:14.770
you had assigned different
frameworks to different people,

00:35:14.770 --> 00:35:16.440
which was interesting.

00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:19.370
First time, I think,
we did that today.

00:35:19.370 --> 00:35:20.722
So that was cool.

00:35:20.722 --> 00:35:21.460
Good idea.

00:35:24.860 --> 00:35:26.360
STUDENT 7: I really
liked playing it

00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:30.102
because it sort of fit
my instrument very well.

00:35:30.102 --> 00:35:32.730
I could do like the
slower bluegrass picking,

00:35:32.730 --> 00:35:36.492
and just leave that D open
the entire time pretty much,

00:35:36.492 --> 00:35:37.700
and that leaves a nice drone.

00:35:40.465 --> 00:35:43.432
That makes it easy to play
around on the top three strings

00:35:43.432 --> 00:35:45.939
and it was a lot of fun.

00:35:45.939 --> 00:35:48.230
STUDENT 13: Actually, the
reason we split up frameworks

00:35:48.230 --> 00:35:52.040
is the first time we
decided what to do, Sarah

00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:54.290
and I were both just like,
yeah, we can both do range,

00:35:54.290 --> 00:35:55.810
we can both do note density.

00:35:55.810 --> 00:35:58.260
And then we ended up running
through the piece once,

00:35:58.260 --> 00:36:00.420
and I focused more on
range, and she focused more

00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:01.410
on the note density.

00:36:01.410 --> 00:36:03.750
So we said, well, why not
just make that the framework

00:36:03.750 --> 00:36:04.250
instead?

00:36:04.250 --> 00:36:05.833
PHIL SCARF: Yeah,
that's a great idea.

00:36:05.833 --> 00:36:07.880
That is a very cool idea.

00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:08.380
Excellent.

00:36:13.787 --> 00:36:15.870
STUDENT 10: At the risk
of overworking the flutes,

00:36:15.870 --> 00:36:20.742
can I ask one of you
guys to -- alright, cool.

00:36:26.121 --> 00:36:29.180
So like most of
the other groups,

00:36:29.180 --> 00:36:36.150
the frameworks we ended up
using are range and note density

00:36:36.150 --> 00:36:37.840
again.

00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:40.310
So I was going to start toward
the lower end of the range

00:36:40.310 --> 00:36:41.434
and then gradually work up.

00:36:41.434 --> 00:36:45.265
And then vice
versa for the oboe.

00:36:45.265 --> 00:36:46.890
So I guess rhythmic
progression is just

00:36:46.890 --> 00:36:50.190
like a natural part
of that, as well.

00:36:50.190 --> 00:36:54.074
So we are thinking of playing
in concert G natural minor.

00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:01.500
Yeah, so we're going to
start off just alternating,

00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:04.897
with one person doing a
drone on the concert G.

00:37:04.897 --> 00:37:07.355
And then the other person just
kind of soloing off of that.

00:37:07.355 --> 00:37:09.809
And then just
interchanging a few times.

00:37:09.809 --> 00:37:11.350
Maybe two or three
times or whatever.

00:37:11.350 --> 00:37:15.830
And then, just gradually
working into playing together.

00:37:15.830 --> 00:37:16.830
PHIL SCARF: That's cool.

00:37:16.830 --> 00:37:19.455
And did you have a specific idea
about the rhythmic progression

00:37:19.455 --> 00:37:21.250
and how that would work?

00:37:21.250 --> 00:37:26.290
STUDENT 10: Just in the vague
sense of gradually speeding up.

00:37:26.290 --> 00:37:28.850
Starting off with slower,
sustained whole notes

00:37:28.850 --> 00:37:33.995
and working to faster rhythms.

00:37:33.995 --> 00:37:36.470
We kind of wanted to work
some [? chellan ?] in there,

00:37:36.470 --> 00:37:38.140
as well.

00:37:38.140 --> 00:37:40.968
We don't have any kind of set
phrase we wanted to repeat.

00:37:40.968 --> 00:37:42.634
I guess it's something
we kind of wanted

00:37:42.634 --> 00:37:43.906
to figure out as we go.

00:37:43.906 --> 00:37:45.910
If we find something
worth holding on to,

00:37:45.910 --> 00:37:46.980
then we'll do that.

00:37:54.700 --> 00:40:22.462
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:40:22.462 --> 00:40:23.170
PHIL SCARF: Yeah.

00:40:27.641 --> 00:40:28.140
Nice.

00:40:28.140 --> 00:40:31.480
PROFESSOR: So you're just
coming into this cold, right?

00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:34.528
So I noticed, you
were watching him.

00:40:34.528 --> 00:40:36.830
Had you determined that
you would watch each other

00:40:36.830 --> 00:40:42.590
and do those phrases toward
the end in synchrony?

00:40:42.590 --> 00:40:44.299
STUDENT 2: That was
just based off his --

00:40:44.299 --> 00:40:46.715
he said that he wanted to do
something with [? chellan, ?]

00:40:46.715 --> 00:40:52.480
so I was trying to pick up
some very distinctive phrases

00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:56.320
and see whether I can put
them into different ranges.

00:40:56.320 --> 00:40:59.041
And so I picked out a
couple, and just tried

00:40:59.041 --> 00:41:02.190
to repeat them and then
put them in different notes

00:41:02.190 --> 00:41:05.180
with the same rhythm.

00:41:05.180 --> 00:41:07.802
But by and large, most
of it was just like, oh,

00:41:07.802 --> 00:41:09.490
that sounds nice.

00:41:09.490 --> 00:41:11.740
PROFESSOR: Well I personally
thought it was very good,

00:41:11.740 --> 00:41:13.865
the way it worked out, and
very interesting the way

00:41:13.865 --> 00:41:15.300
it all synchronized.

00:41:15.300 --> 00:41:17.350
I mean, it was like
you planned it.

00:41:17.350 --> 00:41:18.850
Which obviously, you didn't.

00:41:21.519 --> 00:41:24.060
STUDENT 10: Yeah, one problem
we ran into when Ben and I were

00:41:24.060 --> 00:41:27.424
rehearsing was just, when we
got toward the end each time,

00:41:27.424 --> 00:41:29.266
and we tried to make
the rhythm go faster,

00:41:29.266 --> 00:41:32.830
it kind of became more
difficult to play in synchrony.

00:41:32.830 --> 00:41:35.645
Because there's just so
much loudness going on.

00:41:39.590 --> 00:41:41.215
PHIL SCARF: Anybody
else have comments?

00:41:45.340 --> 00:41:46.840
STUDENT 7: You could
really tell you

00:41:46.840 --> 00:41:50.640
could find that
[? challen ?] motif,

00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:52.600
you repeated and played off of.

00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:55.050
I think it worked out nicely.

00:41:58.139 --> 00:41:59.180
PHIL SCARF: Anybody else?

00:42:02.765 --> 00:42:05.098
PROFESSOR: I was just thinking,
it would be interesting.

00:42:05.098 --> 00:42:08.610
We can do this through
the magic of taping,

00:42:08.610 --> 00:42:12.510
to play all these
exactly in sequence.

00:42:12.510 --> 00:42:14.800
And then hear them
as a unified suite.

00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:20.008
Which we could do through
the mystery of taping.

00:42:20.008 --> 00:42:24.200
[INAUDIBLE] It was
very interesting

00:42:24.200 --> 00:42:30.482
how we started with a slower
idea doing some things.

00:42:30.482 --> 00:42:33.095
Then we got more rhythmicized
as we got to the middle.

00:42:33.095 --> 00:42:35.950
Then we had this as the ending.

00:42:35.950 --> 00:42:38.202
Well, your thing just before
that and then this thing

00:42:38.202 --> 00:42:39.701
at the end, which
is very different.

00:42:45.377 --> 00:42:46.085
PHIL SCARF: Cool.

00:42:49.584 --> 00:42:50.500
Thank you.

00:42:50.500 --> 00:42:52.960
So what I thought is,
maybe, as a group,

00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:55.570
we can try some of
the frameworks that

00:42:55.570 --> 00:43:00.150
didn't get selected
for today's assignment.

00:43:00.150 --> 00:43:03.286
So I was thinking,
why don't we do --

00:43:03.286 --> 00:43:06.210
I forget what I called
it, the constrained range.

00:43:09.500 --> 00:43:10.470
Confined range, OK.

00:43:10.470 --> 00:43:12.940
So there's one called
[? tans ?] confined range.

00:43:12.940 --> 00:43:16.510
And then we have the expanding
and contracting [? tans. ?]

00:43:16.510 --> 00:43:19.680
So maybe we can try those.

00:43:23.330 --> 00:43:28.880
And actually, why don't we as
a group figure out a a design?

00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:30.760
Why should I say
what the design is?

00:43:30.760 --> 00:43:32.660
Let's use those frameworks.

00:43:32.660 --> 00:43:34.640
And who wants to
volunteer, who wants

00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:38.180
to give us an idea
of how we can start?

00:43:38.180 --> 00:43:39.870
Or how to use the frameworks?

00:43:47.820 --> 00:43:50.864
I see an elbow going up.

00:43:50.864 --> 00:43:52.510
You got to be careful.

00:43:52.510 --> 00:43:57.500
It's like you're at
an auction, and if you

00:43:57.500 --> 00:44:00.068
do something like that, you
just bought it, you know?

00:44:05.307 --> 00:44:06.890
OK, well I know you
guys been thinking

00:44:06.890 --> 00:44:07.889
about these for a while.

00:44:07.889 --> 00:44:09.722
Yes, go ahead.

00:44:09.722 --> 00:44:12.305
STUDENT 7: Normally with range,
we start low and then go high,

00:44:12.305 --> 00:44:14.221
why don't we start high
and slowly incorporate

00:44:14.221 --> 00:44:15.040
the low notes?

00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:16.370
PHIL SCARF: That's fine.

00:44:16.370 --> 00:44:17.210
That's cool.

00:44:17.210 --> 00:44:18.600
And so that takes care of range.

00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:25.150
But who can think of what to do
with this confined range idea?

00:44:25.150 --> 00:44:26.780
And then expanding
and contracting.

00:44:26.780 --> 00:44:29.830
What could we do with
those two things?

00:44:29.830 --> 00:44:31.410
When you say start
high and move low,

00:44:31.410 --> 00:44:35.180
did you mean we have the
confined range times?

00:44:35.180 --> 00:44:35.710
OK.

00:44:35.710 --> 00:44:38.480
So the confined range
times, we'll start high.

00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:41.344
And then what are
we going to do?

00:44:41.344 --> 00:44:42.760
STUDENT 7: Expand
them slowly out?

00:44:42.760 --> 00:44:44.000
PHIL SCARF: So expanding.

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:44.500
OK.

00:44:44.500 --> 00:44:44.830
Right.

00:44:44.830 --> 00:44:47.246
So expanding more down, because
we're going to start high.

00:44:47.246 --> 00:44:48.970
So expanding them down.

00:44:48.970 --> 00:44:51.650
And when we do the
expanding and contracting,

00:44:51.650 --> 00:44:53.180
these are more like linear.

00:44:53.180 --> 00:44:55.510
So you're kind of
going up and down,

00:44:55.510 --> 00:44:57.450
progressively up and down.

00:44:57.450 --> 00:45:01.330
So you would make the point,
if you're expanding downwards,

00:45:01.330 --> 00:45:04.340
you'll say you'll start here,
and go down and back up.

00:45:04.340 --> 00:45:05.970
And then go down,
farther and back up,

00:45:05.970 --> 00:45:07.178
and then farther and back up.

00:45:07.178 --> 00:45:10.420
Every time, you go progressively
farther and farther.

00:45:10.420 --> 00:45:12.300
And then, is that it?

00:45:12.300 --> 00:45:14.570
Or anybody else have
anything else to add?

00:45:14.570 --> 00:45:16.028
STUDENT 13: Maybe
when we contract,

00:45:16.028 --> 00:45:21.352
we can contract the top note,
so that the top end of the range

00:45:21.352 --> 00:45:22.060
is getting lower.

00:45:22.060 --> 00:45:24.610
And then we can track
down to the bottom tonic.

00:45:24.610 --> 00:45:26.270
PHIL SCARF: That
is a killer idea.

00:45:26.270 --> 00:45:27.680
I love that.

00:45:27.680 --> 00:45:28.540
OK.

00:45:28.540 --> 00:45:29.350
So that's good.

00:45:29.350 --> 00:45:33.640
And then, anything else?

00:45:36.500 --> 00:45:38.170
I think that's enough.

00:45:38.170 --> 00:45:40.090
So I think we can
play with that.

00:45:40.090 --> 00:45:42.579
So let's just review
this one more time,

00:45:42.579 --> 00:45:43.870
make sure I got this right, OK?

00:45:43.870 --> 00:45:46.161
I'm going to try to summarize
what I think we're doing.

00:45:46.161 --> 00:45:48.750
So we're starting with
a constrained range

00:45:48.750 --> 00:45:50.910
or confined range
[? tans, ?] which

00:45:50.910 --> 00:45:53.589
are fast lines, as opposed
to these slow lines which

00:45:53.589 --> 00:45:54.880
everybody's been starting with.

00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:57.440
So we're starting
something fast.

00:45:57.440 --> 00:45:59.600
But you've got to
pick just a few notes.

00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:02.030
Like three or four notes, and
just stick with those notes

00:46:02.030 --> 00:46:04.990
and just keep going fast
passages using those notes.

00:46:04.990 --> 00:46:06.660
And then after a
while, we're going

00:46:06.660 --> 00:46:08.540
to start doing expanding
and contracting,

00:46:08.540 --> 00:46:13.110
expanding [? tans. ?]
Expanding downwards,

00:46:13.110 --> 00:46:14.800
progressively farther downwards.

00:46:14.800 --> 00:46:20.040
And then start doing it
but reducing the upper part

00:46:20.040 --> 00:46:25.030
of the range, and then wind
up with some probably confined

00:46:25.030 --> 00:46:28.170
range, constrained range
[? tan ?] at the bottom.

00:46:28.170 --> 00:46:29.850
Yeah.

00:46:29.850 --> 00:46:30.490
OK.

00:46:30.490 --> 00:46:32.390
Great.

00:46:32.390 --> 00:46:35.140
So any questions
or anything about?

00:46:35.140 --> 00:46:37.218
Does that reflect what
you guys want to do?

00:46:37.218 --> 00:46:40.430
STUDENT 13: Do you want
to pick a mode or the key?

00:46:40.430 --> 00:46:42.520
PHIL SCARF: That's
a great question.

00:46:42.520 --> 00:46:44.080
I am tempted to say no.

00:46:44.080 --> 00:46:45.737
Because everybody's doing that.

00:46:45.737 --> 00:46:47.570
So I think we should
do something different.

00:46:47.570 --> 00:46:51.301
My two cents is no.

00:46:51.301 --> 00:46:51.800
No.

00:46:54.490 --> 00:46:56.207
That's just my two cents.

00:46:56.207 --> 00:46:58.040
Because everybody seems
to be still worrying

00:46:58.040 --> 00:46:59.569
about the modes and the scales.

00:46:59.569 --> 00:47:01.360
STUDENT 13: But there's
like a dozen of us.

00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:03.760
Won't it --

00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:04.470
PHIL SCARF: OK.

00:47:04.470 --> 00:47:05.990
You guys, feel free
to override me.

00:47:05.990 --> 00:47:08.156
My two cents is I wouldn't
get too worried about it.

00:47:08.156 --> 00:47:11.070
But if you want to pick
a starting note maybe.

00:47:11.070 --> 00:47:13.675
That might be good.

00:47:13.675 --> 00:47:14.800
STUDENT 4: We can try both.

00:47:14.800 --> 00:47:15.633
We can try it twice.

00:47:18.804 --> 00:47:19.762
We could just try both.

00:47:19.762 --> 00:47:21.490
We could just try
it as you say first,

00:47:21.490 --> 00:47:23.902
and then see what
it sounds like.

00:47:23.902 --> 00:47:24.610
PHIL SCARF: Yeah.

00:47:24.610 --> 00:47:26.440
Because, hey, we can
always do it again.

00:47:26.440 --> 00:47:31.470
So let's try it without
overly defining this too much.

00:47:31.470 --> 00:47:32.470
And see how it goes.

00:47:32.470 --> 00:47:33.720
And then we can talk
about it, and see

00:47:33.720 --> 00:47:35.220
if it's something
we want to change.

00:47:35.220 --> 00:47:36.580
How about that?

00:47:36.580 --> 00:47:38.540
All right.

00:47:38.540 --> 00:47:42.861
So I'm going to let
you guys start --

00:47:42.861 --> 00:47:43.860
maybe I won't even play.

00:47:43.860 --> 00:47:45.776
I'll let you guys play,
why do I need to play?

00:47:50.900 --> 00:47:53.778
Is everybody ready?

00:47:53.778 --> 00:47:54.742
OK.

00:47:54.742 --> 00:48:34.055
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:50:24.060 --> 00:50:25.680
PHIL SCARF: Cool.

00:50:25.680 --> 00:50:26.180
OK.

00:50:26.180 --> 00:50:27.470
That was nice.

00:50:27.470 --> 00:50:30.130
So any thoughts about this?

00:50:33.210 --> 00:50:35.857
STUDENT 13: One thing I noticed,
is by the time we ended,

00:50:35.857 --> 00:50:37.940
I think, most people already
done the contracting,

00:50:37.940 --> 00:50:39.071
and I hadn't.

00:50:39.071 --> 00:50:42.250
And it was just very difficult
to listen to other people,

00:50:42.250 --> 00:50:45.710
to figure about what kind
of range they were in.

00:50:45.710 --> 00:50:49.890
Since everyone was in a
different part of their range.

00:50:49.890 --> 00:50:53.164
I couldn't just listen to
the sax and be like, oh yeah,

00:50:53.164 --> 00:50:54.580
he's in the low
part of his range.

00:50:54.580 --> 00:50:57.565
Because listening to the
flute or the banjo would like

00:50:57.565 --> 00:51:00.298
get me sort of confused about
what range everyone was in.

00:51:06.710 --> 00:51:08.710
PHIL SCARF: Well there's
so many people playing.

00:51:08.710 --> 00:51:12.300
It's pretty thick with
everybody playing.

00:51:12.300 --> 00:51:15.260
You know, the thing, in Indian
classical music, of course,

00:51:15.260 --> 00:51:18.770
normally there would
be one lead performer,

00:51:18.770 --> 00:51:20.430
one lead melodic performer.

00:51:20.430 --> 00:51:23.580
There might be two if it's
like a duel under your duet

00:51:23.580 --> 00:51:26.090
kind of program.

00:51:26.090 --> 00:51:30.520
There would typically be
an accompanist or even two,

00:51:30.520 --> 00:51:36.790
but they would be playing a much
more secondary role, usually.

00:51:36.790 --> 00:51:40.450
So we wouldn't have this
kind of size ensemble.

00:51:40.450 --> 00:51:41.160
Wouldn't happen.

00:51:41.160 --> 00:51:44.170
So these frameworks,
really, we can certainly

00:51:44.170 --> 00:51:46.930
apply them to a large ensemble.

00:51:46.930 --> 00:51:50.950
Traditionally, it
wouldn't be like this.

00:51:50.950 --> 00:51:52.750
Any other comments or thoughts?

00:51:56.110 --> 00:51:58.230
STUDENT 12: I felt like
we sort of ended up

00:51:58.230 --> 00:52:06.558
finding a modal
center, but we had

00:52:06.558 --> 00:52:10.094
some type of tonal
center of some sort.

00:52:10.094 --> 00:52:12.165
I don't know.

00:52:12.165 --> 00:52:13.790
PHIL SCARF: Yeah, I
think you're right.

00:52:13.790 --> 00:52:15.280
It's sort of emerged.

00:52:15.280 --> 00:52:18.109
PROFESSOR: I thought
you all started on one.

00:52:18.109 --> 00:52:20.608
Sounded to me like you were
all, I don't know what that note

00:52:20.608 --> 00:52:24.840
was, but -- anybody
else notice that?

00:52:28.568 --> 00:52:31.150
I mean, after all
that discussion.

00:52:31.150 --> 00:52:34.150
Everybody just intuitively said,
okay, we're going to do over,

00:52:34.150 --> 00:52:36.650
and that was pretty interesting.

00:52:36.650 --> 00:52:40.360
And again, I was the only
non-playing observer,

00:52:40.360 --> 00:52:48.821
but in addition to this concept,
of the range increasing and all

00:52:48.821 --> 00:52:51.490
that kind of thing,
contracting, you're

00:52:51.490 --> 00:52:53.700
also dealing with texture.

00:52:53.700 --> 00:52:55.330
So the whole thing
could be looked

00:52:55.330 --> 00:52:58.072
at as an exercise in texture.

00:52:58.072 --> 00:53:00.280
Particularly in the beginning
part and the last part,

00:53:00.280 --> 00:53:01.880
as I was hearing.

00:53:01.880 --> 00:53:03.080
Which is interesting.

00:53:03.080 --> 00:53:10.930
Which means that your
specific contributions,

00:53:10.930 --> 00:53:14.290
it's the overall
that's more important.

00:53:14.290 --> 00:53:15.412
To me, anyway.

00:53:15.412 --> 00:53:17.036
I don't know what
you think about that.

00:53:26.820 --> 00:53:30.360
PHIL SCARF: I don't know,
with so many people playing,

00:53:30.360 --> 00:53:32.304
everyone has their
own contribution.

00:53:32.304 --> 00:53:33.220
Everybody's listening.

00:53:33.220 --> 00:53:34.969
And there's so much
going on, it's hard --

00:53:34.969 --> 00:53:37.770
some people are probably trying
to pick out maybe what one

00:53:37.770 --> 00:53:40.228
person is doing, or maybe others
are kind of trying to hear

00:53:40.228 --> 00:53:42.762
the overall sound.

00:53:42.762 --> 00:53:44.470
When you have so many
people improvising,

00:53:44.470 --> 00:53:48.241
it's challenging to
figure out how to fit in.

00:53:48.241 --> 00:53:48.740
Yes.

00:53:48.740 --> 00:53:50.652
STUDENT 12: I thought
speaking of fitting in.

00:53:50.652 --> 00:53:53.042
I think this was the
first time in this class,

00:53:53.042 --> 00:53:57.310
for me, at least, that I
wasn't trying to fill a space.

00:53:57.310 --> 00:53:59.240
I was just like, oh,
I'm just going to go.

00:53:59.240 --> 00:54:03.920
Because we had talked about
having that type of texture.

00:54:03.920 --> 00:54:06.930
And I think, most of the time
when you improvise, somebody

00:54:06.930 --> 00:54:09.757
starts something, and then
somebody else comes in and is

00:54:09.757 --> 00:54:11.340
trying to fill a
space that they left.

00:54:11.340 --> 00:54:14.280
And this was different
because we were just, like,

00:54:14.280 --> 00:54:16.730
who cares about
each other's space,

00:54:16.730 --> 00:54:18.710
and just went all over it.

00:54:18.710 --> 00:54:19.420
PHIL SCARF: Yeah.

00:54:19.420 --> 00:54:20.968
That's right.

00:54:20.968 --> 00:54:23.384
STUDENT 7: I think one thing
that really would have helped

00:54:23.384 --> 00:54:25.856
is if we'd trickled
in at the beginning,

00:54:25.856 --> 00:54:29.494
that way we could
have sort of set a --

00:54:29.494 --> 00:54:31.440
STUDENT 12: I liked
it, I mean, we've

00:54:31.440 --> 00:54:34.920
never sounded like that before.

00:54:34.920 --> 00:54:36.600
PROFESSOR: The effect
was pretty strong.

00:54:40.050 --> 00:54:42.910
STUDENT 7: I feel like we did
sort of start funneling in.

00:54:42.910 --> 00:54:45.595
The beginning just
started as chaos,

00:54:45.595 --> 00:54:47.220
everyone was doing
something different.

00:54:47.220 --> 00:54:51.240
We did start to funnel
in towards the end.

00:54:51.240 --> 00:54:53.582
We might have been
funneling in to two or three

00:54:53.582 --> 00:54:57.762
different places, but
we were funneling.

00:54:57.762 --> 00:54:58.640
PHIL SCARF: Yeah.

00:54:58.640 --> 00:55:01.800
You know, part of
improvisation can be chaos.

00:55:04.865 --> 00:55:05.855
It doesn't have to be.

00:55:05.855 --> 00:55:09.320
But it can be.

00:55:09.320 --> 00:55:11.260
So that's part of
the game, you know?

00:55:11.260 --> 00:55:13.580
If it goes into chaos, then
where's it go from there,

00:55:13.580 --> 00:55:14.080
you know?

00:55:14.080 --> 00:55:16.050
Does something start to gel?

00:55:16.050 --> 00:55:16.955
Or come together?

00:55:19.620 --> 00:55:22.800
Improvisation, especially when
you're doing with a group,

00:55:22.800 --> 00:55:25.134
it has a life of
its own, you know?

00:55:25.134 --> 00:55:26.800
And everybody's kind
of going with that.

00:55:30.380 --> 00:55:31.480
Anything else?

00:55:31.480 --> 00:55:32.080
What else?

00:55:37.200 --> 00:55:37.720
OK.

00:55:37.720 --> 00:55:38.620
Cool.

00:55:38.620 --> 00:55:42.550
So let's try
something different.

00:55:42.550 --> 00:55:51.300
Let's try -- OK,
I'll take ideas.

00:55:51.300 --> 00:55:53.430
Ideas about how to set
up an improvisation.

00:55:57.170 --> 00:56:02.250
Let's say we want to use
the constrained range,

00:56:02.250 --> 00:56:06.400
I want to do this constrained
range, confined range.

00:56:06.400 --> 00:56:07.020
OK.

00:56:07.020 --> 00:56:09.710
We use the confined range idea.

00:56:09.710 --> 00:56:11.890
But this time we're
going to extrapolate it.

00:56:11.890 --> 00:56:14.470
And instead of picking notes
that are close together,

00:56:14.470 --> 00:56:17.250
pick three or four notes
that are far apart.

00:56:17.250 --> 00:56:18.520
And use that.

00:56:18.520 --> 00:56:20.820
But I also want to
change this density.

00:56:20.820 --> 00:56:24.110
So that's it's not continuous
high, like everybody

00:56:24.110 --> 00:56:25.200
playing all the time.

00:56:25.200 --> 00:56:30.060
So I want to solicit some ideas
about how we should do that.

00:56:30.060 --> 00:56:33.075
How can we make it thinner?

00:56:33.075 --> 00:56:38.425
STUDENT 7: We could
designate people

00:56:38.425 --> 00:56:42.760
who would be more drone,
lower, longer pitches.

00:56:42.760 --> 00:56:46.170
And who would be higher,
melodic type instruments.

00:56:48.356 --> 00:56:50.480
That way we can sort of
differentiate between that,

00:56:50.480 --> 00:56:53.176
and not everyone's
trying to do melody.

00:56:53.176 --> 00:56:53.800
PHIL SCARF: OK.

00:56:53.800 --> 00:56:54.840
That's a cool idea.

00:56:54.840 --> 00:56:58.270
So by default, people
would be droning.

00:56:58.270 --> 00:57:02.840
And then those who are going
to play the so-called lead part

00:57:02.840 --> 00:57:05.950
would emerge.

00:57:05.950 --> 00:57:06.780
OK.

00:57:06.780 --> 00:57:07.960
Yes?

00:57:07.960 --> 00:57:13.739
STUDENT 2: We could maybe have
a shifting window of maybe two

00:57:13.739 --> 00:57:19.907
or three people at a time, who
are out there trying to make

00:57:19.907 --> 00:57:25.991
a new motif, or kind of -- even
for the people who are just

00:57:25.991 --> 00:57:27.699
droning, they might
be playing something.

00:57:27.699 --> 00:57:31.595
But maybe designate a
moving group of people.

00:57:31.595 --> 00:57:33.543
Not any one, but like.

00:57:33.543 --> 00:57:38.959
You know, Ben can
experiment more, I guess.

00:57:38.959 --> 00:57:41.500
PHIL SCARF: Playing the lead --
we'll call it lead and drone.

00:57:41.500 --> 00:57:43.260
Just to differentiate
the roles, right?

00:57:43.260 --> 00:57:46.060
So having small groups of
two or three people at a time

00:57:46.060 --> 00:57:47.091
playing the lead.

00:57:47.091 --> 00:57:47.590
Right.

00:57:47.590 --> 00:57:48.090
Yeah.

00:57:48.090 --> 00:57:49.520
That's a good idea.

00:57:49.520 --> 00:57:53.130
So any thoughts about
how do we implement that?

00:57:53.130 --> 00:57:54.630
How are we going
to know who's going

00:57:54.630 --> 00:57:56.760
to play the lead part
at any given time?

00:57:56.760 --> 00:57:57.720
Any ideas?

00:57:57.720 --> 00:58:00.600
STUDENT 2: You can just start
with first two or three,

00:58:00.600 --> 00:58:03.014
and then when one drops
out, the next person --

00:58:03.014 --> 00:58:04.180
PHIL SCARF: OK, that's fine.

00:58:04.180 --> 00:58:04.679
Cool.

00:58:04.679 --> 00:58:05.850
So we'll start with three.

00:58:05.850 --> 00:58:08.552
When the first person drops
out, the next person adds in.

00:58:08.552 --> 00:58:10.510
That person drops out,
the next person adds in.

00:58:10.510 --> 00:58:13.230
And we work our way across
the room, how about that?

00:58:13.230 --> 00:58:14.215
OK.

00:58:14.215 --> 00:58:14.715
Great.

00:58:22.190 --> 00:58:23.680
This is for the lead part.

00:58:23.680 --> 00:58:26.500
By default, everyone's going
to be droning, more or less

00:58:26.500 --> 00:58:27.305
all the time.

00:58:27.305 --> 00:58:29.430
And then when it's your
turn to play the lead part,

00:58:29.430 --> 00:58:31.180
you jump out, you
emerge out of that,

00:58:31.180 --> 00:58:32.850
and you go into the lead part.

00:58:32.850 --> 00:58:36.640
And I was just
thinking also, maybe

00:58:36.640 --> 00:58:40.400
we should put in one
more element here.

00:58:40.400 --> 00:58:41.870
Like a note density element.

00:58:43.990 --> 00:58:44.490
Yeah.

00:58:44.490 --> 00:58:46.460
Everybody's going to pick like
three or four notes, which

00:58:46.460 --> 00:58:47.793
don't have to be the same notes.

00:58:49.559 --> 00:58:51.100
You can pick whatever
notes you want.

00:58:51.100 --> 00:58:52.933
And you could base it
on what the people are

00:58:52.933 --> 00:58:54.280
playing who played before you.

00:58:54.280 --> 00:58:55.230
Or not.

00:58:55.230 --> 00:58:57.450
It's up to you.

00:58:57.450 --> 00:58:59.070
But let's do this.

00:58:59.070 --> 00:59:02.630
Let's start it at a
very high density,

00:59:02.630 --> 00:59:05.761
and work our way
to a low density.

00:59:05.761 --> 00:59:06.260
OK?

00:59:06.260 --> 00:59:09.400
But still, the notes
should be rapid.

00:59:09.400 --> 00:59:13.850
So to achieve a low density
with rapid notes, what

00:59:13.850 --> 00:59:16.280
you have to do is maybe
play a few notes and stop.

00:59:16.280 --> 00:59:17.620
Play a few notes and stop.

00:59:17.620 --> 00:59:21.260
So that it's not as dense,
but when you play the notes,

00:59:21.260 --> 00:59:24.410
you're playing rapid lines.

00:59:24.410 --> 00:59:28.180
So let's not play sustained --
the lead players should not be

00:59:28.180 --> 00:59:30.630
playing sustained notes.

00:59:30.630 --> 00:59:33.200
It's only the droners who
are playing sustained.

00:59:33.200 --> 00:59:35.850
And let's do the drone
-- let's pick a note.

00:59:35.850 --> 00:59:38.120
Who wants to pick a
note for the drone?

00:59:38.120 --> 00:59:40.130
A tonic?

00:59:40.130 --> 00:59:41.570
F. OK.

00:59:41.570 --> 00:59:43.030
Cool.

00:59:43.030 --> 00:59:44.100
So let's start.

00:59:44.100 --> 00:59:47.240
And we're going to start over
here and work our way around.

00:59:47.240 --> 00:59:50.030
Three people at a time.

00:59:50.030 --> 00:59:51.069
OK.

00:59:51.069 --> 00:59:51.860
Is everybody ready?

00:59:54.854 --> 01:03:53.820
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:03:53.820 --> 01:03:54.570
PHIL SCARF: Right.

01:03:54.570 --> 01:03:55.069
Good.

01:03:55.069 --> 01:03:56.150
So comments?

01:04:03.710 --> 01:04:05.180
How well do you
think we followed

01:04:05.180 --> 01:04:06.630
the framework, or the design?

01:04:12.486 --> 01:04:14.150
STUDENT 7: We followed
it pretty well.

01:04:14.150 --> 01:04:16.460
It seemed like we were keeping
to the groups of three.

01:04:16.460 --> 01:04:17.168
PHIL SCARF: Yeah.

01:04:17.168 --> 01:04:18.900
We were keeping to
the groups of three.

01:04:18.900 --> 01:04:19.450
That's true.

01:04:19.450 --> 01:04:23.357
I was kind of
helping that along.

01:04:23.357 --> 01:04:24.940
Because sometimes
it was getting hazy.

01:04:24.940 --> 01:04:25.717
But yeah.

01:04:25.717 --> 01:04:27.925
STUDENT 13: I didn't hear
the change in note density,

01:04:27.925 --> 01:04:28.800
I guess?

01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:29.508
PHIL SCARF: Yeah.

01:04:29.508 --> 01:04:32.070
The change in note density
didn't really seem to happen.

01:04:32.070 --> 01:04:33.280
It wasn't too obvious.

01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:36.840
Maybe a little bit, but it
wasn't nearly as pronounced

01:04:36.840 --> 01:04:38.090
as I was hoping it would be.

01:04:38.090 --> 01:04:39.121
STUDENT 12: I
guess I wasn't sure

01:04:39.121 --> 01:04:41.190
exactly what that meant
when you described it.

01:04:41.190 --> 01:04:41.898
PHIL SCARF: Yeah.

01:04:41.898 --> 01:04:45.890
Well I'll try demonstrating
that with my reed -- aw man,

01:04:45.890 --> 01:04:47.160
I'll tell you, this weather.

01:04:47.160 --> 01:04:50.410
When it's cold and it's dry
in here, the reed dries up.

01:04:50.410 --> 01:04:53.225
While we're talking I'll
try to get this resolved.

01:04:53.225 --> 01:04:55.600
Picking three or four notes
and only playing those notes.

01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:58.590
I was hearing like scales and
different things going on,

01:04:58.590 --> 01:05:01.650
which wasn't really
part of the design.

01:05:01.650 --> 01:05:03.640
So that was the other
observation I had.

01:05:09.026 --> 01:05:10.401
STUDENT 7: I
thought we were just

01:05:10.401 --> 01:05:13.240
supposed to start with three
notes and then build out.

01:05:13.240 --> 01:05:15.190
PHIL SCARF: Oh.

01:05:15.190 --> 01:05:17.110
That's not what I had in mind.

01:05:17.110 --> 01:05:20.920
But that's certainly
a possibility.

01:05:20.920 --> 01:05:27.229
But it wasn't what I was
trying to communicate.

01:05:27.229 --> 01:05:28.770
PROFESSOR: If I
could just interject.

01:05:28.770 --> 01:05:32.718
It's almost the most difficult
thing, is just [INAUDIBLE]

01:05:32.718 --> 01:05:34.622
a reduced parameter.

01:05:34.622 --> 01:05:37.954
So three or four notes,
that's really hard.

01:05:37.954 --> 01:05:42.650
Because our inclination
always is to expand.

01:05:42.650 --> 01:05:44.530
So the idea of staying
with this limited

01:05:44.530 --> 01:05:46.949
whatever it is, range
or density or something,

01:05:46.949 --> 01:05:48.490
it's one of the
hardest things to do.

01:05:48.490 --> 01:05:50.284
So just something
to keep in mind.

01:05:50.284 --> 01:05:52.450
We'll probably try to work
on that as we go forward.

01:05:52.450 --> 01:05:53.541
PHIL SCARF: I agree.

01:05:53.541 --> 01:05:54.040
That's true.

01:05:54.040 --> 01:05:55.620
It's a very natural tendency.

01:05:55.620 --> 01:05:59.130
Once you start with
whatever the parameter is,

01:05:59.130 --> 01:06:03.170
you try to build something.

01:06:03.170 --> 01:06:03.970
OK.

01:06:03.970 --> 01:06:08.930
So for example, I'm
going to pick three notes

01:06:08.930 --> 01:06:12.470
and just play some rapid
lines with just three notes.

01:06:31.150 --> 01:06:32.720
So that's pretty high density.

01:06:32.720 --> 01:06:35.160
To go to lower density
without reducing the speed,

01:06:35.160 --> 01:06:36.630
you just leave space.

01:06:36.630 --> 01:06:37.130
So.

01:06:47.700 --> 01:06:52.784
And you could reduce the density
without changing the speed.

01:06:52.784 --> 01:06:54.700
So that's more like what
I was thinking about.

01:06:57.510 --> 01:06:59.360
So I don't know if we
want to try it again.

01:06:59.360 --> 01:07:03.774
Maybe try it again with that
in mind and see what we can do.

01:07:03.774 --> 01:07:07.770
PROFESSOR: So just time-wise,
we have room for one more.

01:07:07.770 --> 01:07:08.520
PHIL SCARF: OK.

01:07:08.520 --> 01:07:09.020
That's cool.

01:07:09.020 --> 01:07:10.830
So we'll do this.

01:07:10.830 --> 01:07:12.684
So we'll do the
same basic thing,

01:07:12.684 --> 01:07:14.100
with everybody
droning by default.

01:07:14.100 --> 01:07:16.640
And then we'll have
our window of three.

01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:20.597
And I may just do
the same thing.

01:07:20.597 --> 01:07:21.430
So let's just start.

01:07:23.950 --> 01:07:27.760
Yeah, still on the F.

01:07:27.760 --> 01:10:22.202
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:10:22.202 --> 01:10:24.160
PHIL SCARF: Still have
a couple minutes, right?

01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:24.868
OK, any comments?

01:10:31.060 --> 01:10:31.950
That was much better.

01:10:31.950 --> 01:10:33.695
Much closer to what
we were trying to do.

01:10:33.695 --> 01:10:34.195
Yes.

01:10:34.195 --> 01:10:34.695
Good.

01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:41.950
So how did that feel?

01:10:41.950 --> 01:10:46.070
Start to compare the last two,
from the performer's point

01:10:46.070 --> 01:10:46.670
of view.

01:10:46.670 --> 01:10:48.128
How did it feel
the play those two?

01:10:55.324 --> 01:10:56.490
STUDENT 7: It's interesting.

01:10:56.490 --> 01:10:58.610
Because we look at
it on a micro scale.

01:10:58.610 --> 01:11:00.450
Each individual
person is playing

01:11:00.450 --> 01:11:03.828
this random, chaotic
assortment of just three notes.

01:11:03.828 --> 01:11:06.036
And when you look
on the macro level,

01:11:06.036 --> 01:11:07.494
when everyone was
playing together,

01:11:07.494 --> 01:11:11.306
it actually sort of made sense.

01:11:11.306 --> 01:11:12.012
I don't know.

01:11:12.012 --> 01:11:13.970
But if you just listen
to each individual part,

01:11:13.970 --> 01:11:18.630
it really didn't make sense,
it was just sort of random.

01:11:18.630 --> 01:11:21.030
PHIL SCARF: OK.

01:11:21.030 --> 01:11:23.090
Anything else?

01:11:23.090 --> 01:11:24.390
Other comments?

01:11:24.390 --> 01:11:27.324
STUDENT 1: I feel like
high density is also

01:11:27.324 --> 01:11:30.132
just as restricting
as like low density.

01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:37.186
There's only certain
things that you

01:11:37.186 --> 01:11:41.834
can play if you're
forced to play fast.

01:11:41.834 --> 01:11:44.497
There's certain things when
you're forced to play slow.

01:11:44.497 --> 01:11:46.080
But you're restricted
to those things.

01:11:49.632 --> 01:11:51.590
PHIL SCARF: As opposed
to having a full pallet,

01:11:51.590 --> 01:11:52.435
of all possibilities.

01:11:52.435 --> 01:11:52.900
STUDENT 1: I didn't mean
restricted as a bad thing.

01:11:52.900 --> 01:11:55.576
I meant, it's just
definitely more constraint

01:11:55.576 --> 01:11:56.243
than I expected.

01:11:56.243 --> 01:11:56.950
PHIL SCARF: Yeah.

01:11:56.950 --> 01:11:58.790
You have to work within
certain limitations,

01:11:58.790 --> 01:12:04.350
and it generates
a certain thing.

01:12:04.350 --> 01:12:07.850
And, you know, these
kind of concepts --

01:12:07.850 --> 01:12:09.910
it's great to think
about it ahead of time.

01:12:09.910 --> 01:12:12.090
And have this design
worked out, and then try

01:12:12.090 --> 01:12:13.310
to implement the design.

01:12:13.310 --> 01:12:19.150
But you can also spontaneously
just play, and use these ideas

01:12:19.150 --> 01:12:20.990
as you go.

01:12:20.990 --> 01:12:24.070
And let the framework,
or let the whole design

01:12:24.070 --> 01:12:29.070
itself kind of
evolve spontaneously.

01:12:29.070 --> 01:12:31.570
It doesn't have to be
something that you've

01:12:31.570 --> 01:12:33.920
planned out before hand.

01:12:33.920 --> 01:12:35.420
PROFESSOR: The one
thing I would say

01:12:35.420 --> 01:12:39.386
is I thought everybody,
comparing the two,

01:12:39.386 --> 01:12:41.318
is the second one,
everybody was listening

01:12:41.318 --> 01:12:43.250
much more closely
than I thought.

01:12:43.250 --> 01:12:45.070
Which is why I think
it worked out better.

01:12:45.070 --> 01:12:46.570
Because you got to
listen as much as

01:12:46.570 --> 01:12:49.320
you make your individual
contributions.
