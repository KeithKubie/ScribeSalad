00:00:00.252 --> 00:00:02.405
Voiceover:In order to
get into Battle School

00:00:02.405 --> 00:00:04.823
cadets have to pass a
rigorous entrance exam

00:00:04.823 --> 00:00:06.964
which includes mathematics.

00:00:06.964 --> 00:00:10.222
Help Commander Graff grade the next wave

00:00:10.222 --> 00:00:11.456
of students' tests.

00:00:11.456 --> 00:00:12.994
The last step of a problem

00:00:12.994 --> 00:00:15.739
in the matrix multiplication section is

00:00:15.739 --> 00:00:18.329
the matrix A times B times C

00:00:18.329 --> 00:00:20.769
where A, B, and C are square matrices.

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:23.377
Which of the following
candidates have answers

00:00:23.377 --> 00:00:25.473
that are equivalent to this expression?

00:00:25.473 --> 00:00:29.784
Select all who are right
for any A, B, and C.

00:00:29.784 --> 00:00:31.495
Select all that apply.

00:00:31.495 --> 00:00:34.041
I encourage you to pause this
video and think about it.

00:00:34.041 --> 00:00:37.017
Which of these expressions
for any square matrices

00:00:37.017 --> 00:00:38.207
A, B, and C

00:00:38.207 --> 00:00:41.491
are equivalent to this right over here.

00:00:42.475 --> 00:00:44.115
I'm assuming you've given a go at it.

00:00:44.115 --> 00:00:45.196
Let's think through each of them.

00:00:45.196 --> 00:00:46.644
This one is B, A, C

00:00:46.644 --> 00:00:48.759
so if they have changed the order

00:00:48.759 --> 00:00:51.369
and we've already seen
that matrix multiplication

00:00:51.369 --> 00:00:53.789
is not commutative in general

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.224
and so this will not be
true for any square set

00:00:57.224 --> 00:00:59.332
of matrices A, B, and C,

00:00:59.332 --> 00:01:01.240
so this is not going to be true.

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.920
Matrix multiplication is not commutative.

00:01:04.843 --> 00:01:09.367
Here you have Bernard, who
says A times, C times B.

00:01:09.367 --> 00:01:11.436
We already know that that's going to be

00:01:11.436 --> 00:01:14.874
the equivalent to A, C, B

00:01:14.874 --> 00:01:16.943
which once again they've swapped the order

00:01:16.943 --> 00:01:18.290
between the B and the C,

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.676
matrix multiplication is not commutative.

00:01:20.676 --> 00:01:22.233
You can't just swap order

00:01:22.233 --> 00:01:23.916
and expect to get the same product

00:01:23.916 --> 00:01:26.958
for any square matrices A, B, and C

00:01:26.958 --> 00:01:28.506
so we could rule that one out.

00:01:28.506 --> 00:01:30.503
A times, B, C,

00:01:30.503 --> 00:01:32.366
so we've already seen
matrix multiplication

00:01:32.366 --> 00:01:33.544
is associative,

00:01:33.544 --> 00:01:38.737
so this is the same thing
as A times B, times C

00:01:38.737 --> 00:01:42.614
which of course is the
same thing as A, B, C.

00:01:42.614 --> 00:01:45.306
What Caren has right
over here, that is right,

00:01:45.306 --> 00:01:47.987
that is equivalent for any
square matrices A, B, and C

00:01:47.987 --> 00:01:51.327
that is equivalent to A, B, C.

00:01:52.342 --> 00:01:54.667
Now Ducheval, let's see,

00:01:54.667 --> 00:01:57.252
now this looks like a
bit of a crazy expression

00:01:57.252 --> 00:01:59.375
but let's think it through a little bit.

00:02:00.698 --> 00:02:03.282
First of all matrix multiplication,

00:02:03.282 --> 00:02:05.126
as long as you keep the order right,

00:02:05.126 --> 00:02:07.322
the distributive property does hold.

00:02:07.322 --> 00:02:10.927
This first part right over
here is equivalent to ...

00:02:10.927 --> 00:02:12.599
Let me write this down,
this one's interesting.

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:23.749
We have A times B, C
plus A, minus A squared.

00:02:23.749 --> 00:02:27.097
You can actually distribute this A

00:02:27.097 --> 00:02:28.932
and I encourage you to
prove it for yourself

00:02:28.932 --> 00:02:32.009
maybe using some two by two
matrices for simplicity.

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:34.656
This is going to be equal to,

00:02:34.656 --> 00:02:38.588
this part over here is going to be A, B, C

00:02:38.588 --> 00:02:44.048
plus A A, A times A which
we could write as A squared

00:02:44.048 --> 00:02:47.793
and then we're going
to subtract A squared.

00:02:47.793 --> 00:02:50.213
These two things are going to cancel out,

00:02:50.213 --> 00:02:52.183
they're going to end up
being the zero matrix

00:02:52.183 --> 00:02:53.667
and if you take the zero,

00:02:53.667 --> 00:02:56.178
so these are going to be the
zero matrix right over here.

00:02:56.178 --> 00:02:58.456
If you take the zero matrix
and add it to A, B, C

00:02:58.456 --> 00:03:04.331
you're just going to end up with A, B, C.

00:03:04.331 --> 00:03:06.124
This one was a little bit tricky,

00:03:06.124 --> 00:03:08.145
this one actually is equivalent.

00:03:08.145 --> 00:03:12.338
This one is right and this one is right.

00:03:12.338 --> 00:03:15.506
Here this is A times B, plus C

00:03:15.506 --> 00:03:19.312
so this is kind of not-y right over here.

00:03:19.312 --> 00:03:21.257
They're not even multiplying B and C,

00:03:21.257 --> 00:03:24.720
so this one's definitely
not going to be true

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.265
for all square matrices A, B, and C.
