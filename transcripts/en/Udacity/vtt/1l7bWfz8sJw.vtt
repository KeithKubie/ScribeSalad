00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
In the next programming quiz, I would like you to print out a table called expand,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
which does not exist right now.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
What expand is, is a table of the same size as grid

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
that maintains at what step each node was expanded.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
So the very first node over here was expanded times 0.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.000
The second node to expand was this one over here: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
In this table, every node that has never been expanded

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
including all the obstacle nodes should have the value of -1.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Like these guys over here - these are obstacles.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
And when a node is expanded, it should get a unique number

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
that is incremented from expansion to expansion

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
and counts from 0, in this case, all the way to 22 for reaching the goal stated.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
To give you a second example of how the quotes should work,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
let me block off the goal by adding 1 over here

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
so there's an entire items that block the left side from the right side.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.876
Now the switch fails, and in the expansion list you find

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
that all nodes on the right side have never been expanded.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.530
You get 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.270
A little warning; this is not unique.

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.210
Depending on how you break ties you might expand in a different order,

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.080
so I don't expect your table to always look exactly the same way as this one over here.

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.810
So for example, you might have 0, 2 over here, and 1 over here

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.000
but what should be the case is when there is a full blockage

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
the right side should just never expand.
