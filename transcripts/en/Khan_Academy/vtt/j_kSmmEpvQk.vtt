00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.740
In the very first immunology
video, where we talked about

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:05.580
nonspecific defense mechanisms,
we said if we had

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.400
some type of a pathogen-- let's
say it's a bacteria--

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:14.040
that our phagocytes can
recognize either proteins on

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.770
the bacteria or maybe it was
some other type of pathogen--

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.095
some other marker
on the pathogen.

00:00:18.095 --> 00:00:20.780
It doesn't know what type of
pathogen it is, but that's

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:23.820
enough for the phagocyte.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.170
It'll engulf the pathogen.

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.220
So let's say this is
the phagocyte.

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.060
Somehow one of their receptors
touches one of the proteins

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:36.560
that's on the surface of this
bacteria in this case and

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.800
says, gee, that's not a good
thing to have around and so

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:39.520
it'll engulf it.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.830
So the membrane is just going to
surround the pathogen-- and

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:46.060
this part is going to go in.

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:48.440
It's going to kind of pinch in
and the pathogen is going to

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.290
get surrounded and
get engulfed--

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.570
phagocytozed by the phagocyte.

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.910
So the end product-- we saw this
on the first video where

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.520
I talked about phagocytes-- is
we're going to end up-- so

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.160
then the membrane's going
to be completely around.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.349
This is going to pinch in and
bubble around this thing and

00:01:05.349 --> 00:01:08.970
so we're going to have
the pathogen sitting

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.100
inside of the phagocyte.

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.680
It's going to be surrounded
by a membrane.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.220
That membrane's called
a phagosome.

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:17.560
And we learned there's
different types of

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.380
phagocytes-- could be a
macrophage, could be a

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:28.280
neutrophil, could be a dendritic
cell-- and we have

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.250
it like this and then we also
saw in that video, it's not

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.460
just done-- the macrophage
doesn't

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.390
just digest this thing.

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:35.970
That by itself is very useful.

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.160
It got this bacteria
out of the way.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.850
If this was a virus, it got
that virus out of the way.

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:42.560
But it does even
more than that.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.850
It takes that and then it lyses
it-- or it breaks it up.

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.700
It doesn't have to actually
use-- well, it breaks it up.

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.430
There's several ways it can do
it, but the bottom line is, it

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:54.680
processes it.

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.930
It'll break up the pathogen--
and we saw that first video on

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:05.810
phagocytes that we'll actually
have a lysosome bond to it and

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.009
dump all sorts of particles that
are going to break up and

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.810
cut up this bacteria,
in this case, into

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.060
its constituent molecules.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.250
And then some subset of the
leftovers, particular chains

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.060
of the peptides-- and remember,
proteins are long

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.580
chains of amino acids.

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.610
Polypeptides are short chains.

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.930
So you take short chains of
those and they're going to

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:34.565
bond to special proteins.

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.800
And this is essentially the
topic of this video.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.350
So let's say they bond to that
special protein, bond to that

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:43.410
special protein.

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.200
And then those proteins get
transported or get to the

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.920
membrane or the outer surface
of the cell and they present

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.750
themselves along with the
piece of the pathogen.

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.420
So the end product after
phagocytozed this pathogen is

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.800
that the phagocyte will look
something like this and it

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:08.320
will have these antigen
presenting proteins, I guess

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.080
we can call them, that had
bound to parts of that

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.870
original pathogen.

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.800
Let me do it right here.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.060
So it has a little bit of the
original pathogen on it that I

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.010
drew in green right here.

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.820
And these proteins right here,
these are called-- it's a

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.120
fancy word and I talked about
it in the previous video--

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:47.140
these are called major
histocompatibility complexes,

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:53.170
or MHC for short.

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:58.170
And when we're talking about
phagocytes or macrophages or

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.270
dendritic cells that are
particular cases of

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:03.600
phagocytes, the major
histocompatibility complexes

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.700
that they present after
they've digested this

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.380
molecule-- this is
an MHC class II.

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:11.630
Let me write this down.

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:16.250
This is an MHC class
II protein.

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.899
It might seem like I'm really
going into the minutiae of

00:04:18.899 --> 00:04:21.880
what these proteins are, but
we're going to see this is key

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.190
for activating other parts of
the immune system, especially

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:27.450
the cell mediated parts
of the immune system.

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:30.630
So this was the case with a
macrophage or a dendrite.

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:34.250
They engulf something, they chew
it all up, and then parts

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:36.860
of the chewed up thing that they
ate, they attach to these

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:41.700
MHC II proteins and these
MHC proteins go to the

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:42.740
surface of the cell.

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.015
The same thing-- or actually not
the quite the same thing--

00:04:45.015 --> 00:04:49.030
a very similar thing happens
with B cells.

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:52.820
So if we have a B cell--
that's a good color.

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:53.900
B for blue.

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:57.590
We know B stands for bursa, but
it could stand for bone

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:58.940
marrow just as well.

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:02.560
Let's say we have a B cell and
it's got its membrane bound

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:03.910
antibody on it.

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:07.450
Remember, it's very specific
to that B cells.

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:10.910
So all of the membrane bound
antibodies, all 10,000 or so

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:14.500
of them on this B cell, they
all expressed the same

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.920
variable part.

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:18.720
So this is a particular
B cell.

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.690
So remember, this
was nonspecific.

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:23.450
When we talked about
phagocytosis, these guys just

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:24.440
say, you're a bacteria.

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:24.980
You're a virus.

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:25.940
I don't know what
kind you are.

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:26.830
I'm just going to eat you up.

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:27.430
You look shady.

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:28.140
I'm going to eat you up.

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:29.435
I don't know what type
you are or whether

00:05:29.435 --> 00:05:30.410
I've seen you before.

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:32.540
When we're talking about B
cells, we're talking about the

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:35.080
adaptive or the specific
immune system.

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:39.190
And so these-- the variable ends
of these membrane bound

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:43.060
antibodies are specific to
certain parts of certain

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:45.650
pathogens, to certain
epitopes.

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:49.030
Remember, epitopes were the
parts of certain pathogens

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:53.010
that these specific chains can
recognize and bond to.

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:55.660
So let's say that we're
dealing with a

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:57.370
virus in this situation.

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:59.400
And let's say the virus
just happens to

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.110
bond to this B cell.

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:02.760
Remember, there might be
other-- in fact, there

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:08.910
definitely are tons of other
B cells around, but their

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:17.130
variable portions are
all different.

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:19.940
And that's what I always find
amazing about B cells is that

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:23.610
they come from the same genetic
line, their genes have

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:26.580
been shuffled around in their
development so that they can

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:29.830
produce billions of combinations
of these

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:34.380
proteins, or the variable ends
of their antibodies.

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:37.400
So let's say we have
some virus.

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:38.300
Let me say it's a bacteria.

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:40.850
When I did the other B cell
example, I said we're dealing

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:41.460
with viruses.

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:46.860
But let's say some new bacteria
and just some part of

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:50.550
its surface just happens to
bind to only this B cell--

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:52.740
because this B cell has just
the right combination.

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:57.010
So some part of his surface
binds just to that B cell

00:06:57.010 --> 00:06:57.600
right there.

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:59.760
That part of the surface that
binds, remember, that was

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:01.000
called the epitope.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.920
That's that part of the pathogen
that binds to our

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:06.780
variable sequencer.

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:09.030
It won't bind to this B cell
or this B cell because they

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:12.540
have different sequences here,
but it binds to this B cell

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:15.180
and then that starts the
activation process.

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:19.830
We'll go into-- sometimes this
by itself can get the B cell

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:22.660
activated, but you normally
need help from helper T

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:24.830
cells-- and we'll talk
more about that.

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:27.130
And we said, once this
happens, once you get

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:30.620
activated or the activation
process starts, this guy

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:32.850
actually gets engulfed-- and I
didn't talk about that in the

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:34.740
last video just because I didn't
want to go into too

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:35.400
much detail.

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:42.230
So this whole thing gets
engulfed by the B cell.

00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:46.870
And then when it gets activated,
it proliferates

00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:49.960
itself and you normally need
the T cells there and some

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:52.245
part of them become plasma B
cells, some part of them

00:07:52.245 --> 00:07:53.495
become memory B cells.

00:07:58.590 --> 00:08:02.350
Remember, the plasma B cells
say, gee, I've been activated.

00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:05.180
I'm just going to produce a
ton of these antibodies.

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:07.850
So the plasma B cell will just
produce tons of these

00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:10.720
antibodies and start spitting
them out so that they can

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:14.020
attach to more and more of that
pathogen and just mess

00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:18.650
them up in different ways,
either tag them so that other

00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:23.070
macrophages or phagocytes eat
them up-- or tag two of them

00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:25.380
so you bundle them up so that
they can't operate properly.

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:25.700
Whatever.

00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:27.120
I'm not going to go into
detail on that.

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:28.390
That's when it gets activated.

00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:31.860
But the interesting thing is
that the B cell will also do

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:33.909
what the phagocytes do.

00:08:33.909 --> 00:08:41.840
The B cell will also take
this guy into the cell.

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:47.100
Maybe he's initially attached
to the antibody-- and break

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:55.140
him up, take pieces of this
pathogen and attach it to MHC

00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:59.790
II proteins and then present
them on the surface.

00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:03.495
So a B cell will also
present the antigen.

00:09:06.970 --> 00:09:11.220
So this is also an MHC
II complex-- a major

00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:13.790
histocompatibility complex--
and just so you know, histo

00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:14.700
means tissue.

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:17.050
So this is related to whether
something is compatible with

00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:19.260
the tissue in your body and
we'll talk more about that and

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.380
how it relates to transplants
and all of that.

00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:25.750
So this is also an
MHC class II.

00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:28.250
In both cases, whether we're
talking about B cells that

00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:31.950
recognize a very specific
pathogen-- and it could be a

00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:37.090
specific virus, a specific
protein, a specific bacteria,

00:09:37.090 --> 00:09:40.350
or in the cases of phagocytes,
they'll just say,

00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:41.210
oh, you look shady.

00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:42.050
Let me take you in.

00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:44.300
I don't know what type of
bacteria or virus or protein

00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:47.940
you are, but in either case,
they both engulf them, take

00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:50.190
pieces of them, cut them up,
and present them on their

00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:52.580
surface in a complex
with the major

00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:57.040
histocompatibility complexes.

00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:01.450
So cells that do this are called
professional antigen

00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:02.700
presenting cells.

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:07.770
This is what they do for a
living, although they do other

00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:09.430
things, as we've seen.

00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:10.750
The phagocytes eat things.

00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:14.640
The B cells generate antibodies
or memories so that

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:17.355
they can later be activated to
generate antibodies, but these

00:10:17.355 --> 00:10:25.730
are called professional antigen
presenting cell.

00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:29.630
And the antigen in question is
this little piece of the

00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:35.420
actual thing that you're trying
to track, that little

00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:38.720
piece-- the actual part of the
pathogen, that's what the

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:40.520
antigen-- so it's presenting
the antigen.

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:48.630
It's professional because it
takes pathogens from in the

00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:51.940
fluid of our system and then
engulfs them, breaks them up,

00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:53.510
and then presents them.

00:10:53.510 --> 00:10:57.810
Now there are also
nonprofessional antigen

00:10:57.810 --> 00:10:58.530
presenting cells.

00:10:58.530 --> 00:11:00.910
And in fact, most
cells are this.

00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:02.600
In fact, even these guys.

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:03.770
Actually, I'm going to wait
for the next video.

00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:05.960
I realize all of my videos
are getting long.

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:10.280
So you're probably thinking,
these guys in either case

00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:12.030
engulf them, cut them
up, present them,

00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:13.320
what is it good for?

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:18.690
You'll see these MHC II, these
are what are recognized by

00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:20.290
helper T cells.

00:11:20.290 --> 00:11:23.830
It'll all form part of the
puzzle of how our immune

00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:24.420
system works.

00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:28.160
So in the next video, I'll talk
about MHC I presenting

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:31.450
cells, which is pretty
much all body cells.
