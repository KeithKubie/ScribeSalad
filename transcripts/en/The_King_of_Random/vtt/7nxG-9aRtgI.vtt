00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.179
Hey guys, I'm Nate welcome back to the workshop in our previous video

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.779
We showed you the beginning steps of building a tabletop fire pit now

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.009
We're going to take all of the pieces that we've prepped before and permanently assemble them into a fire pit

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.150
Let's start by soldering the long coil with the two elbows and the small straight piece in between

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.570
Solder and copper pipe properly does take a little bit of prep work

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.320
So let's clean up all of the joints so that the bond will be strong

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:32.130
There's a tool that's made for cleaning out the inside of copper joints that looks kind of like cone-shaped wire brush

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:36.509
But unfortunately I also don't have one of those so I am using some very fine grit sandpaper

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.690
Wrapped around the end of a pen it's actually working pretty well

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.870
There we have it, we've prepped and cleaned all of the copper pieces that will make connections

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.169
Before we can solder our copper pipes together

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.719
we do have to add a little bit of flux this helps the solder flow evenly and not oxidize I

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:08.580
Also need to apply a little bit to the inside joint. This is of course a much larger brush than is necessary

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.460
To get this solder to take and really seal well on this copper pipe

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:20.820
what I need to do is heat up the joint a lot and then tap the solder onto it if it's properly heated with the

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.979
Flux added correctly it should pull the liquid solder into the gap and seal it up

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:33.209
Everyone out there who's way better at soldering copper pipe than I am please don't make fun of me too much

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.210
I haven't done this much before at all

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.520
- on it

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.940
Well it's ugly, but I think it's soldered

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.430
Hey that one actually turned out pretty good

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:05.549
There's probably some very specific way to know when you're at the perfect temperature so that the solder will melt and flow nicely

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.880
But it's not just gonna burn and fall off. I don't know what that method is

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.889
Now we've got the top coil of our fire pit all assembled

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.950
It's soldered together, and I'm pretty sure it's even airtight

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:37.009
Which is just what we want not bad for my second time ever soldering copper pipe learning new skills today. It's good

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.700
let's solder a straight piece on then pass it through the pan and

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.799
Then we'll attach the second piece on the outside if we attach all of these right here

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:51.079
We won't be able to fit it through our pan anymore because this hole is only large enough for the smaller fitting not for this

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.080
larger one

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.880
Oh

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:07.790
It's pretty good now let's pop that down through the pan careful because it is quite hot

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:24.730
Seems pretty well attached everywhere got some good solder on there if it's good to go

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.079
You just want to let it cool down a little bit our piping is all soldered together

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.960
We've let it cool down to the point where it's no longer difficult to touch

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:36.850
Let's attach this to our fuel line and then fit it inside our plastic container

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:39.200
beautiful

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.700
Alright, that's looking good, but at this point if we were to turn on the gas

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.570
It would have nowhere to go

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:50.499
what we need to do is drill some holes into our copper pipe up on top so the fuel has somewhere to escape to I

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:57.279
Have here about the smallest drill bit that will fit into this Chuck and still actually grip on if I go too small

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.659
There's a little bit of a hole down the center of the different teeth and it'll just slide in and out

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:06.460
But I think this size should be good, so I'm just going to put several holes going around this copper tube

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:09.790
And that's where the propane butane fuel mixture will come out

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:22.809
The copper tube in the top now has holes drilled in it

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:27.489
So it should be ready to test lighting on fire, but some of you may have caught on to the fact that so far

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.769
It's pretty difficult to turn on the gas

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:35.440
Inside this container if I just tried to twist the handle as it is I'd have to open it and then attach

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:39.279
The lid and the whole time propane and butane would be spewing into the air

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:40.120
That's no good

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:44.500
So what we want to do is give ourselves a way to turn the gas on and off while the lid is attached

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:50.859
So first let's take off this small wire handle the plan is that we'll drill a small hole into the side of the plastic

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:55.509
through that we'll have a length of straightened copper tube which can reach in and

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:00.669
turn the little key that lets the gas come out at the moment if you put it on into swivels and doesn't turn it at

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:03.879
All we'll flatten the tube so that it fits nicely onto our key

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:08.829
Looks like just the right height now we want to use a bit

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:14.710
That's just larger than our copper pipe so that it'll easily fit in including the flattened end designed to fit over the key

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:27.999
Let's just take some sandpaper in our pen and clean up that edge a little bit in the end it probably won't even be very

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.100
Visible, but it's just nicer if it's clean

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:39.400
You can now fit the copper pipe through the side of the container and it fits perfectly over the key

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:43.779
Let's flatten the end of our tube so that it can actually get some grip on our gas key

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:49.150
the fuel can is inside the plastic container we can now reach through with our piece of copper pipe fit it over the key and

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:51.260
Open the gas

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:55.029
Since we don't want to have an extra foot of copper pipe sticking out at all times

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:57.429
Let's just mark off where we want to cut this

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:10.700
Our piece is cut down

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:16.420
We've cleaned up the edge and at this point a copper cap fits nicely over it so this will work as our key

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:21.009
To turn our gas on and off our copper pipe fits nicely over the fuel key

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:25.840
But I am going to try and crimp it down a little more so it's a little bit more of a snug fit and won't

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:28.599
Bend or warp the copper when we try and turn it on and off

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:39.520
That works great so to finish up this piece, so let's clean up the edges and solder the cap on

00:06:47.419 --> 00:06:53.869
Our copper pipe key is now finished, so let's try putting everything together and do a rough test to see if this is working

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:56.240
It's looking pretty good

00:06:56.669 --> 00:06:58.669
See what happens if we turn this key

00:07:08.099 --> 00:07:10.099
Look at that

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:13.310
How big can it go

00:07:14.159 --> 00:07:16.159
Really big, too big

00:07:17.069 --> 00:07:19.489
Turn that down a bit again, that is

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:21.569
beautiful

00:07:21.569 --> 00:07:26.449
It's coming out perfectly nice. Even flames all the way around our circle

00:07:27.599 --> 00:07:28.099
excellent, excellent, excellent, excellent! whoo!

00:07:28.099 --> 00:07:30.079
 

00:07:32.129 --> 00:07:34.549
Yes, all right I'm gonna turn it off by twisting the key

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:42.650
Perfect that worked great oh, I'm excited. I love when things work well

00:07:43.169 --> 00:07:48.198
Well at this point what we need to do is make it look a little bit nicer

00:07:48.479 --> 00:07:50.778
It's working great, but it looked kind of boring

00:07:50.779 --> 00:07:51.599
So let's take some

00:07:51.599 --> 00:07:57.709
Decorative elements add those on and really make this thing with nice our base being made of clear plastic is really nice while we're building

00:07:57.710 --> 00:07:59.900
It because we can see everything that's going on inside

00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:04.250
But it doesn't really look very professional when you can just look at your fuel tank

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:06.949
I want to decorate the outside of the plastic container

00:08:06.949 --> 00:08:11.478
And then I also have these blue pieces of glass that I want to put in the bed above the fire coil

00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:16.490
What we're going to do is take these paint sticks cut them down to the height of our plastic container

00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:21.139
And then use some hot glue to glue them on going all the way around of course

00:08:21.139 --> 00:08:24.528
We'll have to drill a hole in one of the sticks so that our key can still fit in and out

00:08:24.599 --> 00:08:30.408
I'm actually going to just measure up to the brackets because our pan will be on top and we'll never really be able to see

00:08:30.409 --> 00:08:32.409
this piece of the clear plastic

00:08:33.209 --> 00:08:35.899
This way I don't have to fit them around each single bracket

00:08:54.810 --> 00:08:58.339
Let's start with the slat that we need to drill a hole into to fit over our key

00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:01.669
Let's put a little mark right where we want the center of the hole to be

00:09:08.009 --> 00:09:10.009
Looks nice

00:09:12.389 --> 00:09:15.079
Perfect he slides in and out

00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:22.040
Beautiful let's take some hot glue apply it to the inside of our cut paint stick and then glue it in place on the container

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.579
Our first ones in place now. Let's just go around the rest of the container adding paint sticks all the way

00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:35.959
All right, we've got one spot left

00:09:35.959 --> 00:09:41.539
That's just slightly wider than our last paint stick so we are gonna have to trim this down to make it fit

00:09:49.510 --> 00:09:52.439
Beautiful there we go that looks pretty nice now

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:57.330
Let's just take these glass beads and add them all around on the inside of our pan

00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:04.780
I

00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:09.230
Got these beads at Hobby Lobby they come in these little net bags

00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:13.610
I bought two of the bags and each bag was only like three dollars, so it's pretty cheap

00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:16.610
I think it would be fine if the glass were right on top of the pipe

00:10:16.610 --> 00:10:21.019
But I am trying to clear a path just a little bit so the gas has somewhere to go

00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:28.669
It's looking pretty good, I think at this point what we have to do is turn it on and see how it looks oh

00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:40.940
That's fantastic

00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:43.609
Thank you that a little tabletop

00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:46.580
fire pit a

00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:53.330
Lot of good heat coming off of that too that looks so cool. I love the contrast the orange fire with the blue glass

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:56.840
That's why I chose the blue glass. It's just they look really good together

00:10:57.660 --> 00:11:00.079
Wow, that looks so cool. I'm just gonna turn it up

00:11:03.090 --> 00:11:05.420
Bigger fire always more fun

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:12.979
Wow that is a hoot, that's the dumbest expression I've ever used I hope you're here

00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:17.090
I do want to point out that while this is small enough to fit on a tabletop

00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:21.319
It's really not something that you want to use indoors for any extended period of time

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:24.470
Propane and butane unless they're burned

00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:27.589
100% can let off carbon monoxide gases

00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:30.769
And you can see that there's smoke coming off of here both of those are stuff

00:11:30.770 --> 00:11:33.259
You don't want inside your house for any long period of time

00:11:36.450 --> 00:11:41.119
There you have it a fire pit is a super fun thing to gather around if you don't have one

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:44.210
This is easier to build than it is to install one in your yard

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:48.170
It's not gonna put out the same amount of heat of course, but it does work pretty well

00:11:48.170 --> 00:11:53.269
There's a good amount of heat coming off of this and of course I can turn it up even more if I want well. That's

00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:57.349
Toasty very toasty very quickly this whole build only takes a few hours

00:11:57.350 --> 00:12:03.589
And it's pretty fun to do I especially enjoyed learning the new skill of soldering the copper together although some people out there probably think

00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:08.930
What I did looked pretty sloppy it worked. Well. It's airtight and for a first time. It's not bad

00:12:09.210 --> 00:12:12.650
Thanks for joining us for this project today, and we look forward to the next one talk to you then

00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:21.859
This is better at night, I got a five, but then sits on your table now

00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:24.860
What won't they think of next?

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:26.330
Hey guys grant here

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:29.120
Just want to pop in with a quick update that the king of random brand is

00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:36.169
Expanding Nate's here because you wanted more DIY more variety more frequent videos and together. We're all making that happen. Thanks for your support
