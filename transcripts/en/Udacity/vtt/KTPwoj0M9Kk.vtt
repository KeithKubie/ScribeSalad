00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So coming back to our example, here are the variances again.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Let me give you another word that's really important called standard deviation.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
The variance by its very nature computes in the quadratic.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
It's the quadratic deviation from the mean.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
In fact, it's the average quadratic deviation from the mean.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
If you don't want something quadratic,  then you can take the square root of it,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and you get what's called the standard deviation.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:39.000
In the first case √0.8 is 0.8944, and second case the √148.4 is about 12.18.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
This is how much you expect the age of an individual family member to deviate

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
from the mean by about 12 years.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Whereas here you expect the deviation to be just below 1 year.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
You can see why this is a good approximation.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Here 4 of the 5 kids differ in age by 1 yr

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
whereas here people differ as much as 20 years in age from the mean.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
The variance and the standard deviation are much larger.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Let's practice this.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
I'll give you a couple of quizzes now.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
I'll give you data. I want you to complete the mean for me, the variance and the standard deviation.

00:01:14.000 --> 99:59:59.000
3, 4, 5, 6, 7--please fill in all three of those values.
