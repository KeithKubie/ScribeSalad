00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:02.540
&gt;&gt; Male Presenter: Good afternoon everyone.

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:03.730
My name is Brian Rose.

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:05.630
I'm
from the photos team.

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:11.470
I'm here presenting Thomas Hawk
for part of our photographers at Google series.

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:13.410
Thomas
Hawk is a prolific photographer.

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.240
He's here from the Bay
Area.

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:18.750
And one of his life goals is to produce more
than one

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.210
million photographs.

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:22.550
He's well on his way there.

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.340
If you
are on Google+, you'll probably, or actually

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:27.289
you've almost
certainly seen his photos.

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:31.420
Either re-shared by his
friends, shared in your own stream or in our

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:32.870
"what's hot"
stream.

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.309
At 450,000 followers, he's most certainly
one

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:38.829
of our top followed photographers but he's
also one

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:40.989
of our most followed users on Google+.

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:44.610
Last night, he launched his Photo Talk Plus,
Live streamed

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.879
hangouts which he co-hosts with Lotus Carroll
every Wednesday

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.309
evening and I encourage you to check it out
not just

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.120
because I was on there last night.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.899
[chuckles] For a quick bit of
admin, there will be plenty of time for Q

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:59.260
and A but I
encourage you to use the microphones on the

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.190
side for the
benefit of our YouTube and video conference

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.190
audience.

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:04.980
So
with that, please join me in welcoming Thomas

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.610
Hawk for
the photographers at Google series.

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:08.710
[Applause]

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.800
&gt;&gt; Thomas: Well, thank you Brian.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.920
And thanks for everybody for
coming out.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.450
I'm glad to be here at Google.

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.020
I'm a big
fan of Google's.

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:25.600
I've enjoyed Google+ and all the
great things you guys are doing with photography.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.660
I'm
happy to be here today.

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:32.670
Looking forward to sharing some
photos talking a little bit about just sort

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.820
of my vision
in general with photography and how I approach

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.160
it, how I
look at it, how I do what I kind of do.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.560
Brian said
yeah -- oh, is that better?

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:45.560
Okay.

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.290
Yeah, my goal is to
publish a million photographs before I die

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:52.640
which is a
pretty ambitious goal.

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.520
There have been a lot of prolific
photographers over the years.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.670
I've kind of tried to find
out photographers that are doing that much

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.830
publishing and
there are not a lot of them out there.

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:08.030
For me, I'm not
sure exactly where that comes from other than

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.849
I have a
desire to constantly be active with photography

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:15.579
and see
the world through my camera every single day.

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:19.690
And by
setting a very arduous schedule like that

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.970
and a very lofty
goal, it really helps me to be focused constantly

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.900
on
photography.

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:31.260
One thing like I would just say everybody
in this room I also have a day job.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.310
I'm not a
professional photographer.

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.920
And so, one of the questions
I get a lot is how do you do so many photographs?

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.659
How do
you do so much work and still kind of manage

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:43.439
your other
stuff in your life?

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:46.269
And so, I'm going to talk a little
bit about that today and what I do.

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:49.930
In addition to
full-time job, I've got four young kids.

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.790
I've got a 7,
8, 9, and 11-year-old.

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:58.130
I've found photography, as
passionate as I am about it, you've really

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.500
got to be
incredibly efficient with it and you've got

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.349
to make it
work for you in every way.

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:05.060
I'll talk about some of the
things I do to become more efficient in my

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:10.010
own work as
well as, in addition to that, talk about my

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.420
-- one of my
projects right now which is to photograph

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.159
the 100 largest
American cities.

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:18.160
I've photographed now 31 of the 100 largest
American

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:19.160
cities.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.280
I'm doing more and more each year.

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.450
And so, this
year I'm gonna knock off some more.

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:28.310
Route 66 from Tulsa through
Los Angeles.

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:34.109
This year I went to St. Louis and Houston
and Austin and Detroit and a number of other

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:35.109
places.

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:36.909
I'll talk
about those trips and how I plan for those

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:38.569
trips and how
I decide what I'm going to shoot on those

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:42.400
trips and I how I do those trips as
efficiently as I can.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.439
I'm also going to talk a little
bit about my experiences photo sharing in

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:46.700
general.

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.400
I've
been online sharing photos for a while now.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.920
I guess I
first started in 2003.

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.489
I got involved with Flickr very,
very early and became one of the most active

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:00.739
Flickr
users and one of the most followed users there.

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:04.489
And talk about my strategy with that.

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:07.819
I will say
to start, again like I said before, I'm not

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:10.120
a
professional photographer although I do make

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.200
money with
my photography.

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.400
It's not my primary source of income.

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.360
I
think that for me being able to focus just

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:23.280
on my art as a
nonprofessional photographer affords me certain

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.310
luxuries.

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:28.840
And one of those is I don't care a lot about,
you know,

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:29.860
making money with my work.

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.640
I don't care if people steal
my work.

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.730
You know, everything is licensed creative
commons.

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:36.390
I don't watermark things.

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:40.230
I don't try to
prevent people from getting my stuff.

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:43.090
My goal as an
artist is that people will see my stuff as

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.760
much as
possible everywhere.

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:51.630
So because I don't have to worry
about making a living for it, you know, I

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:53.170
think
that's an important distinction.

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:55.970
Also I can shoot what I
want to shoot and I can really focus on what

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:56.970
I really want to
shoot.

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:59.690
I think for all of you who have day jobs,
that's

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:01.760
a nice luxury to be able to have a lot of
photographers.

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.920
A lot of professional photographers they don't
have that luxury.

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:06.840
They have to say, "Well, OK, I'm shooting
these weddings."

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.580
Last
night on our show we interviewed Scott Jarvie

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.100
who's a
professional wedding photographer.

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:12.440
He's gotta do his weddings and he's gotta
do this.

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.980
He does other stuff
but I think I've got a luxury to be able to

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:19.480
shoot sort of
whatever I want, which is nice.

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:23.640
So I'm going to also go
through some pictures up here while we talk,

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:25.730
in general.

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:27.280
And sort of talk about that.

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:30.660
We recently did a trip to
Death Valley.

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:31.660
Had a great time.

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:33.910
There are a number of
Googlers on there including our own Brian

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:43.190
Rose, his wife Kim, out on the
playa . There's some more pictures.

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:45.160
That's Lotus
Carroll, my co-host.

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:49.660
Some of you may know Vincent doing a big jump
out on the playa.

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:55.570
This was a playa called the Racetrack.

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:57.540
And beautiful colors in Death Valley.

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:03.550
So I'm going to go through some pictures,
as well.

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:05.760
You
know, the first thing as far as time goes,

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:08.360
you know the
question I get a lot is how do you do your

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:09.360
job?

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:10.360
How do
you do your kids and how do you still have

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:11.550
so much time
to take photos?

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:15.700
The first thing is, the camera goes with
me everywhere.

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:20.720
If you're serious about photography and
you want to take it up on the side in addition

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:23.780
to your
job, I would say, being able to carry that

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:27.540
camera with you everywhere
is a good place to start.

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:31.050
I take this backpack with me a
lot of places which has all of my lenses as

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:33.420
well so I'm a
little hard core with it.

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:39.510
But even if it's just a
Micro Four Thirds or smaller camera or just

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:42.070
a digital SLR and a
zoom lens, something like that.

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:43.850
I think carrying it everywhere
you go.

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:45.470
I find I'll steal time.

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:48.510
I live in the East Bay
and I work in San Francisco.

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:51.390
So if I'm going to take the
BART home, I'll purposely backtrack on the

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:53.490
BART so I can
get a seat so I can be processing photos the

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:54.690
entire time.

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:59.210
I
try to make the most efficient use for photography

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:01.410
of all
of my time that I'm not working or with my

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:03.670
family or
kids.

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:05.530
So a big part of that is thinking about that
as

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:06.530
your day.

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:07.530
If I'm going to have some exercise.

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:09.630
Yesterday
I was going to take a walk.

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:12.660
So you know walk around with
the camera in San Francisco.

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:16.100
Take it out do an impromptu
photo walk all by yourself.

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:19.410
I find if you incorporate
other areas of your life like commuting.

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:22.210
Sometimes when
you're driving you can't process when you're

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:24.280
driving.

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:28.450
If
you're commuting; if you're exercising, anything

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:31.620
you do
find time to do that.

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:38.650
As far as my project for the 100
largest American cities, I think we all travel.

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:41.700
And
when I took on this project, I knew that I

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:44.920
wasn't going
to have a lot of time in individual cities.

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:46.890
So I wanted
to figure out how I could most efficiently

00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:49.030
shoot those
cities.

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:51.060
And the first thing I do before I go on a
trip

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:54.430
is I very carefully research exactly what
I'm going to

00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:55.610
shoot.

00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:57.450
I found Flickr is the best resource for that.

00:07:57.450 --> 00:07:58.680
I'll usually get to a city.

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:02.350
I'll look for the city of
Chicago or the city of St. Louis.

00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:05.550
I'll sort that by
interestingness on Flickr and I'll look at

00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:09.780
a lot of what
other people have taken, interesting shots.

00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:11.780
I'll get a
lot of my locations from that.

00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:13.140
I'll use that as a
location scout.

00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:15.450
A lot of the photos on Flickr are
geo-tagged.

00:08:15.450 --> 00:08:17.230
If they're not geo-tagged, a lot of times
you can figure out

00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:20.240
where they are anyways.

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:24.140
And with those points ahead of
my trip I'll make a Google map and I'll go

00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:26.450
in and I'll
make the pinpoints of every place I'm going

00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:29.020
to shoot in
that city and I don't always get to all of

00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:31.350
them on that
map before I ever even leave.

00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:33.610
In fact weeks before.

00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:35.469
And
I'll also coordinate them.

00:08:35.469 --> 00:08:38.060
So if there's something I
really, really want to shoot I'll use a different

00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:39.199
kind of
pin.

00:08:39.199 --> 00:08:43.500
If it's, "well, I'd like to get that; that'd
be nice", I might use a different pin.

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:46.700
So
before I ever leave, I got a very, very well

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:51.560
thought out
map of exactly what I'm going to shoot.

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:58.250
Once I go on the
trip, I'll coordinate my route so I hit a

00:08:58.250 --> 00:08:59.670
lot of the
things in a row.

00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:01.620
I don't want to waste any time.

00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:03.329
I
sleep very little on the trip.

00:09:03.329 --> 00:09:06.620
I usually do long
weekends so I'll do a Friday to Monday because

00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:09.550
I can get
away from work during that time.

00:09:09.550 --> 00:09:14.740
And I'll use every waking hour I can
possible focused on shooting this agenda that

00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:17.430
I've mapped
out for myself.

00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:21.129
I try to avoid driving during rush hour.

00:09:21.129 --> 00:09:23.420
So if I know I'm going to be in a car, I'll
purposely

00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:24.970
plan my trip around that.

00:09:24.970 --> 00:09:28.790
I'll have places that I'm going to be walking
around shooting during rush hour.

00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:31.660
I'll make the most of
my sunrises and sunsets.

00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:35.209
If I'm going to go to Austin,
I want to shoot the Pennybacker Bridge at

00:09:35.209 --> 00:09:36.209
sunrise.

00:09:36.209 --> 00:09:38.370
I'll
be out there; I'll have that already set out.

00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:41.199
So I have my sunsets and sunrises especially
planned.

00:09:41.199 --> 00:09:45.750
Those are always oftentimes times around rush
hour traffic so you want to find a good, very

00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:49.240
picturesque location to
shoot.

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:51.800
When I am, also when I plan on the trips I
think

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:53.350
back up is very important.

00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:59.019
I learned early on that inevitably,
for whatever reason, you end up losing photos

00:09:59.019 --> 00:10:00.019
on trips.

00:10:00.019 --> 00:10:01.069
I
don't know what it is.

00:10:01.069 --> 00:10:03.269
It's the one time the hard drive goes bad.

00:10:03.269 --> 00:10:05.180
It's the one time something goes wrong.

00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:07.160
Your memory card malfunctions.

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:10.029
You accidentally
format your card when you thought you had

00:10:10.029 --> 00:10:13.550
got all your photos
off but you didn't.

00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:15.459
So there's a lot of mistakes you could
make.

00:10:15.459 --> 00:10:22.730
I bring with me just a little one terabyte
FireWire 800 Seagate portable drive, I don't

00:10:22.730 --> 00:10:24.300
remember what they're called, but they're
not that

00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:27.430
expensive and I use that as a Time Machine
drive on my

00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:28.430
Mac.

00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:32.220
So everything gets backed up as I go.

00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:34.910
So if I lose
stuff I'll be able to get it back.

00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:36.990
I have lost stuff; I've
got it back.

00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:38.149
Even recently in Death Valley.

00:10:38.149 --> 00:10:42.180
I went to bed and
I thought all the photos had been copied.

00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:44.269
I thought they
were and I took the card off in the morning

00:10:44.269 --> 00:10:46.480
and I
reformatted and I used it and I realized I

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:50.060
missed 200 photos
at the end of my Racetrack.

00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:52.029
So I had to use card recovery
software to get them back.

00:10:52.029 --> 00:10:55.279
So I was able to get them
back so you can even when you format a card

00:10:55.279 --> 00:10:58.980
you can still
almost every time get the pictures back with

00:10:58.980 --> 00:10:59.980
recovery
software.

00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:02.649
But you have to be very mindful of losing
pictures.

00:11:02.649 --> 00:11:06.939
Particularly if you're going to go on a trip
you're going to take 10, 12, 13, 15 thousand

00:11:06.939 --> 00:11:07.939
photographs.

00:11:07.939 --> 00:11:08.939
You
want to make sure that they're backed up so

00:11:08.939 --> 00:11:11.610
I clear out a
lot of space on my hard drive on my Mac.

00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:15.470
I got a 750 gigabyte hard drive internally
lot so I make sure I have a lot of room

00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:16.470
there.

00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:19.350
I have a Time Machine drive that backs up
everything.

00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:22.009
I've got a formula where every night when
I

00:11:22.009 --> 00:11:24.760
come in at the end of every night I have to
religiously

00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:25.930
do certain things.

00:11:25.930 --> 00:11:28.579
One is I have to make sure all my cards
are off loaded.

00:11:28.579 --> 00:11:32.380
I don't use Adobe Lightroom to off load
my cards and import it, although I might do

00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:33.380
that at home.

00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:34.380
Because it's slower.

00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:35.620
I just drag and drop them.

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:37.930
From
this is a date folder to a date folder as

00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:38.930
fast as I can.

00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:41.319
I got a 64 gigabyte card; I've got to get
a lot of pictures off.

00:11:41.319 --> 00:11:44.050
I won't have time; I want to go to sleep.

00:11:44.050 --> 00:11:46.209
I also steal time during the day.

00:11:46.209 --> 00:11:47.209
You do get tired.

00:11:47.209 --> 00:11:48.920
You can't go 20 hours straight.

00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:50.379
So you
need bathroom breaks.

00:11:50.379 --> 00:11:51.930
You need water breaks.

00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:54.680
Starbucks,
I use a lot of times for that.

00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:56.170
Starbucks is great
because they're consistent.

00:11:56.170 --> 00:11:57.529
You know they're going to
have a bathroom.

00:11:57.529 --> 00:12:00.029
[laughter] You know they're going to have
coffee and caffeine

00:12:00.029 --> 00:12:01.029
which I live on.

00:12:01.029 --> 00:12:03.920
You know they're going to have water.

00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:04.949
So I'll plan that.

00:12:04.949 --> 00:12:06.279
And they usually have power.

00:12:06.279 --> 00:12:08.040
And
they have wifi.

00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:09.040
So free wifi.

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:10.350
So it's very, very
consistent.

00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:12.110
So whatever I think about their coffee, it
kind of

00:12:12.110 --> 00:12:13.110
doesn't matter.

00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:16.990
I'll get a little coffee and just you know
focus on my stuff and get it done on a break.

00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:19.199
But to use all that
time efficiently while I'm having coffee.

00:12:19.199 --> 00:12:20.279
While I go to
the bathroom.

00:12:20.279 --> 00:12:24.310
Not while I'm going to the bathroom unless
somebody's watching my computer and stuff

00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:26.059
or they'll steal it.

00:12:26.059 --> 00:12:28.060
But
you know I'll make sure that I get those pictures

00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:30.100
off
during the day and then reformat the card

00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:31.100
and keep using it.

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:33.370
At the end of the day, that needs to be done.

00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:35.370
The
batteries need to be charged.

00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:37.149
I keep three fully charged
batteries.

00:12:37.149 --> 00:12:38.819
But the end of the day I'm putting one in.

00:12:38.819 --> 00:12:41.459
It's the last thing I do before I go to bed.

00:12:41.459 --> 00:12:46.040
Make sure
you got a fully charged battery the next morning.

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:47.629
That's
sort of my routine.

00:12:47.629 --> 00:12:48.629
Every night do that.

00:12:48.629 --> 00:12:49.769
Then you're ready
fresh for the next day.

00:12:49.769 --> 00:12:51.889
Have the bag packed have it
ready for sunrise.

00:12:51.889 --> 00:12:52.889
Yeah, question?

00:12:52.889 --> 00:12:55.720
&gt;&gt;Male #1: Do you travel by yourself or with
people?

00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:57.830
&gt;&gt; Thomas Hawk: Well, that's a good question.

00:12:57.830 --> 00:12:59.640
I do travel by myself
sometimes.

00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:00.959
I can be very efficient.

00:13:00.959 --> 00:13:02.870
A lot of times I travel with people.

00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:05.199
So
speaking of people, that's another point.

00:13:05.199 --> 00:13:06.199
When I am
preparing my trip.

00:13:06.199 --> 00:13:08.129
I mention I make a map.

00:13:08.129 --> 00:13:10.240
Another
thing I do frequently is I'll go, and this

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:14.240
is usually in
Flickr, but I'll go to the local Flickr user

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:15.670
group for
that town.

00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:17.569
So maybe it's Detroit, maybe it's Miami.

00:13:17.569 --> 00:13:21.399
There's inevitably a group focused in that
area.

00:13:21.399 --> 00:13:23.740
And
I'll say, "hey, I'm coming to town."

00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:27.449
And I have found
almost every town I've gone to I've ended

00:13:27.449 --> 00:13:29.889
up hooking up
with some locals.

00:13:29.889 --> 00:13:35.040
And in addition to all the stuff I can
find on Flickr and map out, locals are fantastic.

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:38.569
Because oftentimes, if you
look at their work and see what they're shooting.

00:13:38.569 --> 00:13:41.529
My friend
Michelle, who's down in Miami, who I'd never

00:13:41.529 --> 00:13:42.529
met before.

00:13:42.529 --> 00:13:44.149
I
kind of knew her online.

00:13:44.149 --> 00:13:45.639
We were kind of friends.

00:13:45.639 --> 00:13:47.899
We became really good
friends when I went down in Miami.

00:13:47.899 --> 00:13:50.029
She has all these
great abandoned spots.

00:13:50.029 --> 00:13:53.510
We're shooting this old abandoned
boat racing amphitheater.

00:13:53.510 --> 00:13:54.959
It's graffiti everywhere.

00:13:54.959 --> 00:13:55.999
And we're up on the roof of it.

00:13:55.999 --> 00:13:59.540
And
you get great shots and all of that.

00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:04.869
I find by finding locals -- oops, must verify
the account,

00:14:04.869 --> 00:14:07.529
uh, Google music manager.

00:14:07.529 --> 00:14:12.149
[laughter] I like Google music by the way.

00:14:12.149 --> 00:14:16.089
So I'm going to flip through a few more of
these while we

00:14:16.089 --> 00:14:17.089
talk.

00:14:17.089 --> 00:14:18.830
But I find locals are very, very helpful.

00:14:18.830 --> 00:14:19.939
Look for
locals.

00:14:19.939 --> 00:14:21.940
One thing I hope at some point I'm able to
do

00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:23.079
better with Google+.

00:14:23.079 --> 00:14:26.129
I created at one point in Google+ a little
post created a

00:14:26.129 --> 00:14:28.730
Google map hey if you're on Google+ put yourself
on

00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:30.149
this map.

00:14:30.149 --> 00:14:32.519
We don't really have anything like that right
now in

00:14:32.519 --> 00:14:33.552
Google+ but I'd love that.

00:14:33.552 --> 00:14:36.059
I would love to be able to say I'm going to
go to

00:14:36.059 --> 00:14:37.059
Detroit.

00:14:37.059 --> 00:14:38.059
Who are all the photographers in Detroit?

00:14:38.059 --> 00:14:39.059
Who
are all the photographers in New York?

00:14:39.059 --> 00:14:42.119
Who are all the
photographers in Kansas City?

00:14:42.119 --> 00:14:45.749
So I can hook up with them
when I go to these trips and say hey let's

00:14:45.749 --> 00:14:46.749
hang out.

00:14:46.749 --> 00:14:47.749
Let's go shoot this or that.

00:14:47.749 --> 00:14:49.760
I went to Toronto.

00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:52.089
Which
isn't an American city but I like to think

00:14:52.089 --> 00:14:54.809
of the
Canadians as almost Americans.

00:14:54.809 --> 00:14:56.199
No, just kidding.

00:14:56.199 --> 00:14:57.819
Canadians are great.

00:14:57.819 --> 00:15:01.350
[laughter] Canadians are like the
most politest people in the world.

00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:04.069
I had a great
time shooting Toronto.

00:15:04.069 --> 00:15:11.160
When I went up to Toronto, I hooked
up with this guy Toms who's a roof-topper.

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:12.160
We're sitting
up there.

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:14.110
We're going up on these roofs in Toronto,
50

00:15:14.110 --> 00:15:16.050
stories high, setting our tripods, getting
some of the most

00:15:16.050 --> 00:15:20.180
amazing night scenes that you've ever seen.

00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:23.130
And with the
CN tower and stuff like that.

00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:25.649
So you'd never have access
to that without a local.

00:15:25.649 --> 00:15:29.119
So I find before I go on the
trip I mean all of this takes planning.

00:15:29.119 --> 00:15:30.579
Get to know some
of the local people.

00:15:30.579 --> 00:15:32.879
Get to know the local user group.

00:15:32.879 --> 00:15:35.540
Sometimes the locals don't always want to
share but a lot

00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:36.540
of them do.

00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:39.850
When I went to Detroit, a lot of them -- and
I say "hey I'm coming to Detroit."

00:15:39.850 --> 00:15:41.569
They say, "you're just
going to shoot abandoned stuff.

00:15:41.569 --> 00:15:42.569
That's terrible.

00:15:42.569 --> 00:15:44.189
We
don't want people shooting abandoned stuff."

00:15:44.189 --> 00:15:46.360
But you
know you go to Detroit, you got to shoot abandoned

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:47.360
stuff.

00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:50.499
[laughter]
So you know, they're kind of sensitive to

00:15:50.499 --> 00:15:51.499
that in
Detroit.

00:15:51.499 --> 00:15:52.709
So you got to kind of feel out the locals.

00:15:52.709 --> 00:15:54.220
Feel what they want to do.

00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:59.360
I find that having a group
and going with a group is helpful sometimes.

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:00.670
Small
group.

00:16:00.670 --> 00:16:02.040
I've shot cities all by myself, too.

00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:05.079
I went to
Memphis, shot by myself, but went with on

00:16:05.079 --> 00:16:06.079
other guy.

00:16:06.079 --> 00:16:07.679
So
Sean Davis who's a local in Memphis and knows

00:16:07.679 --> 00:16:08.679
a lot about
it.

00:16:08.679 --> 00:16:10.079
He knew a lot of spots.

00:16:10.079 --> 00:16:12.839
On top of the Peabody Hotel.

00:16:12.839 --> 00:16:16.019
Speaking of hotels before you
go -- I like to look at where are all the

00:16:16.019 --> 00:16:17.019
view spots?

00:16:17.019 --> 00:16:19.290
Where can you get up high in the city?

00:16:19.290 --> 00:16:20.660
So do a little
bit of research.

00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:21.709
Is there a bar?

00:16:21.709 --> 00:16:25.699
In San Francisco, our own city up here, you
can get to the top of the Marriott; there's

00:16:25.699 --> 00:16:26.699
a great view from up there.

00:16:26.699 --> 00:16:27.699
They have a bar up there.

00:16:27.699 --> 00:16:32.189
There are some places you can get on top of
the Mandarin

00:16:32.189 --> 00:16:34.079
Hotel in San Francisco.

00:16:34.079 --> 00:16:37.290
Which has a wonderful view down
on the TransAmerica building.

00:16:37.290 --> 00:16:40.160
So hotels are also great
for getting on the top of because a lot of

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:41.550
times you can get
into a hotel.

00:16:41.550 --> 00:16:44.300
It's not like an office building where they've
got security and everything.

00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:46.480
And you can frequently find
your way onto a roof.

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:50.699
I find -- I know this sounds
crazy.

00:16:50.699 --> 00:16:54.340
I find 50, 60 times and yes, you're probably
technically trespassing and all that, but

00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:58.630
50, 60 percent
of the time you can get on most hotel roofs

00:16:58.630 --> 00:17:04.709
and those are some
great places to take shots.

00:17:04.709 --> 00:17:08.760
We'll do some of those from
the roofs and stuff sometimes.

00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:13.679
I think if I do go to a city and do
a photo walk and I do a lot of photo walks.

00:17:13.679 --> 00:17:20.579
I've
probably done 125 photo walks.

00:17:20.579 --> 00:17:25.390
I'll go and schedule that
if it's a big photo walk for one night for

00:17:25.390 --> 00:17:26.750
like three or
four hours.

00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:31.380
Because it's really hard on big photo walks
to really focus on shooting a city.

00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:33.130
You can't shoot it; they're more of a social
thing.

00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:36.450
But if I do a photo walk in a city, but if
you get too many people?

00:17:36.450 --> 00:17:39.560
We went on a
trip to Boston with some friends from Flickr

00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:40.640
and there
were probably 20 people.

00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:41.640
It was too big.

00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:42.640
It was too many.

00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:43.830
You can't keep track of
everybody.

00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:45.419
You kind of lose people.

00:17:45.419 --> 00:17:48.990
So I think -- but I
think planning the trip, having everything,

00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:51.640
having a
route, having everything on Google map before

00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:52.640
you go.

00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:56.380
When I am there, there's no time to be online.

00:17:56.380 --> 00:17:58.250
You know,
I'm not going to be socializing.

00:17:58.250 --> 00:17:59.710
I got to focus on
shooting.

00:17:59.710 --> 00:18:01.049
I'm not going to be processing.

00:18:01.049 --> 00:18:02.960
You have to
resist the urge to process.

00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:04.010
You just took all these
great shots.

00:18:04.010 --> 00:18:05.510
And you're like oh, I just got a sunrise.

00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:07.809
I want to process it get it online.

00:18:07.809 --> 00:18:08.809
It's so cool.

00:18:08.809 --> 00:18:09.809
I want to do it right now.

00:18:09.809 --> 00:18:10.809
You
can't.

00:18:10.809 --> 00:18:13.179
You got to focus shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot,
shoot, shoot.

00:18:13.179 --> 00:18:15.420
There
will be time for that later.

00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:18.289
I know in Death Valley it
was like oh boy we just shot this Racetrack.

00:18:18.289 --> 00:18:20.500
I
want to process them.

00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:21.500
Resist the temptation.

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:33.420
I think
[pause] Oh, one of the other things I do if

00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:36.020
I'm driving
and I have my route in addition to having

00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:39.440
it on a map and
on the phone I actually print it out and print

00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:41.900
it by the
address in order of what I'm going to shoot.

00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:43.500
So I
actually have a printout.

00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:47.770
In case all of a sudden you wont' be able
to connect on the internet or something happens

00:18:47.770 --> 00:18:48.770
and you can't get it.

00:18:48.770 --> 00:18:55.120
I think having a printout helps as well.

00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:57.910
I think considering bundling trips
is also a great way to do it.

00:18:57.910 --> 00:19:00.309
I'll shoot Nashville and
Memphis.

00:19:00.309 --> 00:19:01.890
Austin and Houston.

00:19:01.890 --> 00:19:09.560
Cities that are close
together to try to maximize the travel time.

00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:13.750
As far as
post processing goes, you know, that's a big

00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:14.799
part of it.

00:19:14.799 --> 00:19:18.020
I use Lightroom to process my photos but I
don't have a

00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:19.519
lot of time.

00:19:19.519 --> 00:19:21.840
You have to go very, very quickly.

00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:23.850
If I'm
going to publish a million photos, my goal

00:19:23.850 --> 00:19:28.019
is I have to
process at least 350 photos a week.

00:19:28.019 --> 00:19:30.789
And if I'm gone the
weekend before because I'm doing a shoot,

00:19:30.789 --> 00:19:32.930
that means 700 the next weekend.

00:19:32.930 --> 00:19:34.960
So you got
to power through them and you can't spend

00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:37.840
more than a
couple minutes on a shot.

00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:42.799
These are some shots I took at
the Decompression Event recently in the city,

00:19:42.799 --> 00:19:43.840
in San Francisco.

00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:48.049
Sort
of a Burning Man in the City sort of thing.

00:19:48.049 --> 00:19:50.580
I love
shooting people.

00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:57.159
These are all sort of
interesting-looking people that were at this

00:19:57.159 --> 00:19:58.399
thing.

00:19:58.399 --> 00:19:59.799
And
I shoot anything and everything.

00:19:59.799 --> 00:20:02.370
I shoot people, I shoot
landscapes.

00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:03.610
I shoot nature.

00:20:03.610 --> 00:20:04.610
Flowers.

00:20:04.610 --> 00:20:05.610
I shoot concerts.

00:20:05.610 --> 00:20:06.610
Sure.

00:20:06.610 --> 00:20:11.349
&gt;&gt; Male #2: So how do you get -- [inaudible]

00:20:11.349 --> 00:20:19.460
&gt;&gt; Thomas Hawk: Right.

00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:23.570
Well, because I'm not concerned at all about
the

00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:26.500
economics of this business, I don't get model
releases

00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:29.039
because I'm not going to sell it as a stock
picture.

00:20:29.039 --> 00:20:31.899
And
you can still publish it as a photograph and

00:20:31.899 --> 00:20:33.899
you can
certainly even still put it in a magazine

00:20:33.899 --> 00:20:37.440
or newspaper if
it's editorial or if it's fine art.

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:39.840
The courts have
ruled if it's a fine art photograph, it also

00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:42.470
qualifies as a
no-release.

00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:44.929
I don't bother with releases at all.

00:20:44.929 --> 00:20:49.880
I find it kind of depends on what I'm shooting
and where I'm shooting and how I'm shooting.

00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:53.210
And an
event like this, people are into it.

00:20:53.210 --> 00:20:55.750
They're getting
dressed up because they want to kind of show

00:20:55.750 --> 00:20:57.320
off.

00:20:57.320 --> 00:20:58.320
You
see this guy.

00:20:58.320 --> 00:20:59.320
You still ask his permission.

00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:00.980
"can I get
your picture?"

00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:02.120
"yeah, yeah, yeah."

00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:04.980
These are shot with a
fish-eye, 8 to 13 millimeter fish-eye, so

00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:06.660
I am this close to his nose.

00:21:06.660 --> 00:21:07.660
So I got to warn him.

00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:09.179
And
I say "hey I'm going to be getting real close

00:21:09.179 --> 00:21:15.000
here just so
you're not freaked out".

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:18.840
Fine.

00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:21.490
So and the fish eye are
some new lens I got.

00:21:21.490 --> 00:21:26.519
I've kind of been going crazy with
it.

00:21:26.519 --> 00:21:27.890
So you can get super close.

00:21:27.890 --> 00:21:32.480
So one I did to get
people is find festivals and events like this.

00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:33.830
So
Decompression in the City.

00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:37.210
Burning Man happens every
year, I've never gone, actually, myself, but

00:21:37.210 --> 00:21:39.779
I'm gonna be going this year.

00:21:39.779 --> 00:21:41.490
But you know parades.

00:21:41.490 --> 00:21:44.940
You know the Gay Pride
parade in San Francisco.

00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:46.990
Any sort of events like that.

00:21:46.990 --> 00:21:48.331
I found the vast protests.

00:21:48.331 --> 00:21:49.549
Protests are great.

00:21:49.549 --> 00:21:53.140
I was
shooting the Occupy San Francisco protest

00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:54.140
yesterday.

00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:55.270
I
mean, you can get right in the cop's face

00:21:55.270 --> 00:21:57.370
with the
camera, right in the protester's face with

00:21:57.370 --> 00:21:58.370
the camera.

00:21:58.370 --> 00:22:00.299
You can get some compelling, engaging portraits.

00:22:00.299 --> 00:22:02.350
This
guy, by the way, was completely naked except

00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:03.730
he was covered in silver.

00:22:03.730 --> 00:22:07.180
I'm not going to
show you the picture from lower down, [laughter]

00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:10.720
but we'll avoid
that one.

00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:12.559
But I find that you know you can -- a lot
of

00:22:12.559 --> 00:22:14.789
these -- a lot of places like that.

00:22:14.789 --> 00:22:16.040
Other times though
I'm just shooting street.

00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:17.519
I'm out on the street I got
the camera.

00:22:17.519 --> 00:22:19.460
It's bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.

00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:20.960
You're not asking
permission.

00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:23.440
You don't want to ask permission.

00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:29.530
You --,
you know, comic book conventions.

00:22:29.530 --> 00:22:30.630
Stuff like this.

00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:33.410
To
get great portraits of interesting people.

00:22:33.410 --> 00:22:40.400
You know,
this was at ComicPalooza in Houston.

00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:53.559
So you know places
like this and then I've got Superman there.

00:22:53.559 --> 00:22:55.750
So I think
you can look for those if you want to take

00:22:55.750 --> 00:22:57.240
interesting
pictures of people.

00:22:57.240 --> 00:23:00.779
I do a 2 dollar portrait series
where anybody who asks me for money.

00:23:00.779 --> 00:23:03.409
Oops, camera fell.

00:23:03.409 --> 00:23:07.700
Anybody that asks me for
money I started it a couple years ago I'll

00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:08.700
take your
portrait for two dollars.

00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:11.529
I'll give you two dollars to
take your portrait.

00:23:11.529 --> 00:23:15.730
I found that wasn't even so much a
photography driven project.

00:23:15.730 --> 00:23:18.679
As much as it was when I
first came to San Francisco I was right out

00:23:18.679 --> 00:23:19.679
of college.

00:23:19.679 --> 00:23:20.940
People would ask me for spare change.

00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:22.059
Here you go here
you go.

00:23:22.059 --> 00:23:25.139
And after awhile like jeez this is all the
time.

00:23:25.139 --> 00:23:27.139
And you know I kind of started resenting it
and pretty

00:23:27.139 --> 00:23:28.150
soon I stopped giving them money.

00:23:28.150 --> 00:23:30.400
And pretty soon I
started avoiding people and I didn't like

00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:32.900
that being out
on the street and avoiding people.

00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:37.460
So one day I was in
Portland shooting on the Burnside Bridge.

00:23:37.460 --> 00:23:39.600
I think it's Burnside, I think it's
called.

00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:42.330
And I was having my headphones on as I was
shooting.

00:23:42.330 --> 00:23:44.679
A
lot of times I listen to music and this guy

00:23:44.679 --> 00:23:47.070
homeless-looking guy was kind of walking past
me and he

00:23:47.070 --> 00:23:48.070
said something to me.

00:23:48.070 --> 00:23:50.669
And I said I'm sorry I don't have
any money because I assumed he was asking

00:23:50.669 --> 00:23:51.669
for that.

00:23:51.669 --> 00:23:52.669
And the guy got very agitated.

00:23:52.669 --> 00:23:53.669
And I
stopped.

00:23:53.669 --> 00:23:56.559
I hadn't heard him so I took my headphones
off and said "I'm sorry".

00:23:56.559 --> 00:23:57.690
I wasn't asking few you for
money.

00:23:57.690 --> 00:24:00.730
I want to know if you'd take my picture.

00:24:00.730 --> 00:24:05.169
And I
just felt like a jerk.

00:24:05.169 --> 00:24:06.259
What a jerk I was.

00:24:06.259 --> 00:24:09.029
And so, I
felt really bad I ended up taking the guy's

00:24:09.029 --> 00:24:10.029
picture.

00:24:10.029 --> 00:24:12.750
It
was kind of a moment for me when I said if

00:24:12.750 --> 00:24:15.259
I'm out here
being on the street and part of the street,

00:24:15.259 --> 00:24:18.700
I need to treat
people with respect and I can't be doing that.

00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:21.549
So I said
I'm going to turn this aversion I have to

00:24:21.549 --> 00:24:23.730
people asking me for
money into a photography project and I started

00:24:23.730 --> 00:24:25.100
my 2
dollar portrait project.

00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:29.659
And I've taken a number of
photographs now of individuals and I also

00:24:29.659 --> 00:24:31.389
usually publish a
story.

00:24:31.389 --> 00:24:33.740
Here's one right here.

00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:36.040
I publish a story about
the individuals.

00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:39.460
And I get a little bit about them and I
talk to them as a human being.

00:24:39.460 --> 00:24:40.460
Hey, what's your story?

00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:43.059
Do you have kids?

00:24:43.059 --> 00:24:44.720
And do you want to do this project?

00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:48.090
95 percent of the time they do want to do
the project.

00:24:48.090 --> 00:24:49.570
They say, "yeah, that's great."

00:24:49.570 --> 00:24:50.570
Terrific.

00:24:50.570 --> 00:24:54.309
And they're
thankful and grateful.

00:24:54.309 --> 00:24:55.580
That's another place I get
portraits.

00:24:55.580 --> 00:24:57.480
You find them in odd ways.

00:24:57.480 --> 00:24:59.110
Sometimes you find an
interesting guy in the street and I'll just

00:24:59.110 --> 00:25:00.669
go up to him and say, "hey, can I
take your picture?"

00:25:00.669 --> 00:25:02.120
A lot of times they say no.

00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:05.179
You
know, but a lot of times they say yes.

00:25:05.179 --> 00:25:08.049
So I'll do
portraits like that.

00:25:08.049 --> 00:25:11.620
And sometimes I shoot street just
shoot randomly.

00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:13.780
Every now and then you get somebody who
gets very angry with you.

00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:17.039
You just kinda got to.

00:25:17.039 --> 00:25:20.919
Henri Cartier-Bresson used the term shoot
and scram too.

00:25:20.919 --> 00:25:21.919
Sometimes you shoot and scram.

00:25:21.919 --> 00:25:24.159
You gotta take off.

00:25:24.159 --> 00:25:26.070
But I
think -- if you really look for it there's

00:25:26.070 --> 00:25:28.880
really enough
events that you can find.

00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:31.220
These are shots that I took in
Houston.

00:25:31.220 --> 00:25:33.000
I love shooting street art and graffiti so
I

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:34.070
look for that ahead of time.

00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:37.350
Look for where the graffiti
yards are and go shoot a lot of that; that's

00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:38.679
temporal.

00:25:38.679 --> 00:25:41.169
This is just a street shot so she didn't know
I was taking her photograph.

00:25:41.169 --> 00:25:43.039
I just bam took it.

00:25:43.039 --> 00:25:45.600
So sometimes I'll just take
photographs, too.

00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:47.000
I love cemeteries.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:48.000
I'll shoot in cemeteries.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.889
There's wonderful
statuary you can find sometimes.

00:25:50.889 --> 00:25:53.960
Here's a weeping angel, I think it's in Evergreen
Cemetery, maybe, Houston.

00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:54.960
--Yeah?

00:25:54.960 --> 00:26:11.289
&gt;&gt; Female #1: So one of the things to do [inaudible].

00:26:11.289 --> 00:26:21.039
&gt;&gt; Thomas Hawk: Yeah.

00:26:21.039 --> 00:26:22.520
Sometimes you know I will shoot from the hip
so

00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:24.370
to speak.

00:26:24.370 --> 00:26:28.350
There are some reasonably rough areas in San
Francisco that I've shot like the Tenderloin

00:26:28.350 --> 00:26:31.500
whatnot
where I know there's an active drug deal going

00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:32.510
right
there.

00:26:32.510 --> 00:26:35.330
You're watching the crack change hands and
I've gotten some photos of those.

00:26:35.330 --> 00:26:37.850
I'm
careful how I publish those these days.

00:26:37.850 --> 00:26:40.630
I got called
into court after shooting the Oakland riots

00:26:40.630 --> 00:26:42.751
and had to
get subpoenaed and had to go to court and

00:26:42.751 --> 00:26:43.751
do a lot of stuff.

00:26:43.751 --> 00:26:44.751
. I wasn't too crazy
about that.

00:26:44.751 --> 00:26:49.440
Because I was taking pictures of looters
that were looting out in the Oakland riots.

00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:51.429
A lot of
times when I am shooting from the hip I'll

00:26:51.429 --> 00:26:56.039
actually have
the camera around my neck and I'll hold it

00:26:56.039 --> 00:26:59.690
cable release connected
in my pocket.

00:26:59.690 --> 00:27:01.669
And so, you want to shoot at something like
F

00:27:01.669 --> 00:27:03.490
8 or big wide aperture.

00:27:03.490 --> 00:27:07.679
"F 8 and be there" as a photo
journalist say.

00:27:07.679 --> 00:27:11.750
So you want to have a lot of room for
your focus so if you're getting it wrong you're

00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:13.210
still
getting it because you're not looking through

00:27:13.210 --> 00:27:14.210
the view
finder.

00:27:14.210 --> 00:27:18.419
And I'll shoot with cable release and just
walk around and shoot stuff.

00:27:18.419 --> 00:27:21.140
A lot of times
you'll get stuff that's not worth using.

00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:22.140
I don't like to
do that a lot.

00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:23.140
I like to use the view finder.

00:27:23.140 --> 00:27:26.070
I'll only
do that when I am in a sketchy area where

00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:31.460
there's not an
easy way to be out there like this.

00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:35.871
If there's a drug
deal going down and you're [laughter] You

00:27:35.871 --> 00:27:39.140
might not have
your camera or your life.

00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:41.490
They usually don't like being
photographed.

00:27:41.490 --> 00:27:42.919
But it is street.

00:27:42.919 --> 00:27:45.859
&gt;&gt; Male #3: [inaudible question]

00:27:45.859 --> 00:27:50.279
&gt;&gt; Thomas Hawk: What do you mean?

00:27:50.279 --> 00:27:51.279
Terms of service?

00:27:51.279 --> 00:27:52.809
Like how?

00:27:52.809 --> 00:27:54.509
Oh.

00:27:54.509 --> 00:27:56.000
There's just another street photograph.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.539
But yeah, so
well, speaking of that.

00:27:58.539 --> 00:28:00.700
So we'll get into that a little
bit too.

00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:04.500
We'll talk about photo sharing sites.

00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:06.320
So I
started out with Flickr.

00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:09.659
That's probably the big site
that I was on.

00:28:09.659 --> 00:28:11.809
First of all, I'm a fan of joining every
site.

00:28:11.809 --> 00:28:13.309
I think as far as a photographer.

00:28:13.309 --> 00:28:16.019
If my goal is
to be seen by as many people as possible and

00:28:16.019 --> 00:28:18.000
be published in as many places as possible.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:19.909
. I want to be on
Flickr, I want to be on Twitter, I want to

00:28:19.909 --> 00:28:22.100
be on
Facebook I want to be on Google+.

00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:24.452
I also think
though that you pick a site as your sort of

00:28:24.452 --> 00:28:27.220
primary
social place where you are gonna interact.

00:28:27.220 --> 00:28:28.899
For me that's Google
plus.

00:28:28.899 --> 00:28:31.820
I think that's the most superior platform
for photographers right

00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:32.820
now.

00:28:32.820 --> 00:28:33.820
[applause] We like Google +.

00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:35.930
And Google+, I've written a number of blog
posts on it.

00:28:35.930 --> 00:28:40.299
You guys are doing, you
know, I think everything right for photographers.

00:28:40.299 --> 00:28:43.230
And
it's been so refreshing because before Google+

00:28:43.230 --> 00:28:45.470
I
really think Flickr was sort of the game in

00:28:45.470 --> 00:28:47.190
town.

00:28:47.190 --> 00:28:48.690
Flickr had a lot of problems which we'll go
through a

00:28:48.690 --> 00:28:50.019
little bit.

00:28:50.019 --> 00:28:53.320
But Google+ is a terrific place for
photographers.

00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:54.769
Terrific resource.

00:28:54.769 --> 00:28:56.049
The photo pages look
great.

00:28:56.049 --> 00:28:58.200
The big photos and Lightbox look great.

00:28:58.200 --> 00:28:59.260
There's
tremendous engagement.

00:28:59.260 --> 00:29:03.600
There's a great strong community
thanks to your leaders and community managers

00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:05.470
like
Natalie and like Brian.

00:29:05.470 --> 00:29:07.789
People that are out there
engaging the community.

00:29:07.789 --> 00:29:08.789
And not just them.

00:29:08.789 --> 00:29:09.789
People like
Ricardo.

00:29:09.789 --> 00:29:11.789
People who aren't necessarily community managers.

00:29:11.789 --> 00:29:13.379
There's a lot of people in Google who seem
very

00:29:13.379 --> 00:29:15.290
enthused by photos and are part of that.

00:29:15.290 --> 00:29:17.399
On our Death
Valley trip I don't know I think there were

00:29:17.399 --> 00:29:21.000
probably ten
Googlers that went on the trip.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:26.029
So Gerard, you were there and Vega was there.

00:29:26.029 --> 00:29:27.649
So we had a great trip.

00:29:27.649 --> 00:29:29.760
So I
think Google is really sort of shown a commitment

00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:31.159
to
photography.

00:29:31.159 --> 00:29:37.029
From my perspective, you want to go also
where things are going, not where things have

00:29:37.029 --> 00:29:38.029
been.

00:29:38.029 --> 00:29:40.280
So
to go back to Flickr a little bit.

00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:41.820
Have I gotten into
trouble.

00:29:41.820 --> 00:29:44.971
I've gotten into a lot of trouble on Flickr
both in

00:29:44.971 --> 00:29:46.600
terms of service type issues.

00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:48.000
Some of which were kind of
stupid.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:53.080
Other issues which were more personal in matter.

00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:56.179
You know with Flickr I was banned from their
help forum

00:29:56.179 --> 00:29:59.169
for about two years.

00:29:59.169 --> 00:30:01.610
I was blacklisted from Explore!

00:30:01.610 --> 00:30:03.830
They claim they didn't have a blacklist which
is the

00:30:03.830 --> 00:30:06.090
section where they promote people but they
personally

00:30:06.090 --> 00:30:10.841
blacklisted me out of it as a user.

00:30:10.841 --> 00:30:11.841
I was critical of
Flickr.

00:30:11.841 --> 00:30:14.690
And I think I took the wrong approach with
Flickr initially.

00:30:14.690 --> 00:30:17.200
So I'm never going to be critical of
Google+.

00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:24.460
[laughter] I think the problem with
Flickr is early on because I was a very early

00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:26.919
user
before Yahoo ever bought them, before anything.

00:30:26.919 --> 00:30:30.330
I'd banter back and forth
with Stuart and we'd argue and fight and things

00:30:30.330 --> 00:30:31.330
like that.

00:30:31.330 --> 00:30:33.529
Stewart Butterfield was one of the co-founders
of Flickr.

00:30:33.529 --> 00:30:38.049
There were
things that I thought that Flickr should have.

00:30:38.049 --> 00:30:40.549
Like the
very, very first thing I thought Flickr should

00:30:40.549 --> 00:30:41.549
have was
track backs.

00:30:41.549 --> 00:30:44.029
Everybody is getting these views on our
photos.

00:30:44.029 --> 00:30:46.570
We don't know where they're coming from.

00:30:46.570 --> 00:30:48.580
Flickr is capturing this data, why can't you
give it to

00:30:48.580 --> 00:30:49.580
us?

00:30:49.580 --> 00:30:51.809
Well, if we give it to you, there will be
Spam Well, No.

00:30:51.809 --> 00:30:52.809
I don't understand that.

00:30:52.809 --> 00:30:53.809
How
can there be Spam?

00:30:53.809 --> 00:30:55.100
It's just a referral URL.

00:30:55.100 --> 00:30:56.840
You're sharing with us.

00:30:56.840 --> 00:31:00.769
Flickr did eventually give us
that.

00:31:00.769 --> 00:31:05.379
But I think in doing that, you know I would
find

00:31:05.379 --> 00:31:07.429
things that I didn't like about Flickr and
I'd sometimes

00:31:07.429 --> 00:31:10.940
be more abrasive than I should have, I think,
in hindsight.

00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:12.780
And
particularly Flickr had a practice for a long

00:31:12.780 --> 00:31:16.429
time if an
account was deleted, it was deleted.

00:31:16.429 --> 00:31:17.720
It was gone.

00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:19.840
There was no
getting it back.

00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:25.570
And so, you know, I had content
removed.

00:31:25.570 --> 00:31:31.539
I was an administrator of a group called Delete
Me Uncensored which was kind of a failed experiment

00:31:31.539 --> 00:31:33.649
now
in hindsight which I probably shouldn't have

00:31:33.649 --> 00:31:34.649
been involved in so much.

00:31:34.649 --> 00:31:37.809
But it was kind of a voting game in a group
but it was also

00:31:37.809 --> 00:31:38.860
uncensored forum.

00:31:38.860 --> 00:31:41.470
So you say whatever you want.

00:31:41.470 --> 00:31:44.210
And you
know people would say whatever they want.

00:31:44.210 --> 00:31:46.710
And there
would end up being harassment in there to

00:31:46.710 --> 00:31:53.059
the point
Flickr nuked our group one time.

00:31:53.059 --> 00:31:55.779
I ran a lot afoul with
terms of service.

00:31:55.779 --> 00:31:57.600
And Flickr's were very, very broad.

00:31:57.600 --> 00:32:02.809
They were "don't be that guy" whatever that
means.

00:32:02.809 --> 00:32:04.879
I've
had content.

00:32:04.879 --> 00:32:09.370
I had a huge content battle that I can't
really talk too much about because I was sued

00:32:09.370 --> 00:32:12.059
and I had
to settle so part of the settlement terms

00:32:12.059 --> 00:32:15.519
is
confidentiality agreement but with the erotic

00:32:15.519 --> 00:32:18.480
art museum
down in Miami where I took some pictures.

00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:23.020
They ended up
but I can't get too much into it.

00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:27.909
So I've had some sort
of problems like that in the past.

00:32:27.909 --> 00:32:30.929
That I'm not going to
have on Google+.

00:32:30.929 --> 00:32:36.480
[chuckles] I think one of my
strategies is to be a factory and be a machine.

00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:39.210
I
describe myself as a photography factory sometimes.

00:32:39.210 --> 00:32:43.049
Which is to
publish every single day.

00:32:43.049 --> 00:32:45.831
Schedule publish so I publish
five five posts to Google+ you know, one in

00:32:45.831 --> 00:32:47.850
the early
morning, one in the mid-morning, one about

00:32:47.850 --> 00:32:50.259
noon or one, one in the afternoon, one
in the early evening.

00:32:50.259 --> 00:32:53.210
I've got them all picked out
already so I've got this folder right here

00:32:53.210 --> 00:32:57.110
which has
about 9,000 photographs in it that I've already

00:32:57.110 --> 00:32:58.110
selected.

00:32:58.110 --> 00:33:03.309
So these are photos that I like enough to
publish.

00:33:03.309 --> 00:33:07.289
And
so, you know, they'll be -- and every day

00:33:07.289 --> 00:33:11.009
I just pull
from this folder a different photo kind of

00:33:11.009 --> 00:33:12.950
at random.

00:33:12.950 --> 00:33:15.220
And I want the photos to be kind of at random
also

00:33:15.220 --> 00:33:22.820
because over time -- 
over time I want there to be

00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:24.559
diversity in my photo stream.

00:33:24.559 --> 00:33:27.909
So I want some San Francisco,
some Chicago, all over the United States,

00:33:27.909 --> 00:33:33.580
different places in
time.

00:33:33.580 --> 00:33:34.580
So I just pick every day.

00:33:34.580 --> 00:33:36.159
And then I up load.

00:33:36.159 --> 00:33:40.789
Right now I'm up loading like 40 a day to
Flickr.

00:33:40.789 --> 00:33:42.960
And
so, I'll publish more there.

00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:45.909
With Flickr my strategy is
to publish my best five last because that's

00:33:45.909 --> 00:33:47.330
only what people
see on Flickr.

00:33:47.330 --> 00:33:53.860
They don't see the other ones.

00:33:53.860 --> 00:33:56.029
Another
strategy I think with online, I mentioned

00:33:56.029 --> 00:33:57.029
Delete Me
Uncensored.

00:33:57.029 --> 00:34:00.340
I'm at the point now, where you just have
to avoid toxic people.

00:34:00.340 --> 00:34:02.029
There
are toxic people out there.

00:34:02.029 --> 00:34:04.919
And one of the things that's
really nice about Google+ is there's a very

00:34:04.919 --> 00:34:07.150
robust
block feature.

00:34:07.150 --> 00:34:11.800
I've already seen a lot on Google+
even but I'll see there's Elena Kalis has

00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:14.070
this guy that
just rips into her all the time.

00:34:14.070 --> 00:34:16.290
Oh, she's a terrible
underwater photographer.

00:34:16.290 --> 00:34:18.159
Why do people like her.

00:34:18.159 --> 00:34:20.050
And
you know take a guy like that boom, gone,

00:34:20.050 --> 00:34:21.050
block.

00:34:21.050 --> 00:34:22.050
You don't see him; you never
see him again.

00:34:22.050 --> 00:34:24.919
I had a guy the other day came on my
photo stream, you're the worst photographer

00:34:24.919 --> 00:34:27.099
I've ever
seen ever, ever.

00:34:27.099 --> 00:34:29.040
I'm replying back -- really?

00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:30.040
The worst?

00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:31.040
The
absolute worst?

00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:34.300
[laughter] There's nobody worse than me?

00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:37.940
"no, no
you are the worst."

00:34:37.940 --> 00:34:39.960
Trey has some HDR haters.

00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:42.309
You guys know Trey Ratcliff.

00:34:42.309 --> 00:34:43.839
You're
destroying photography.

00:34:43.839 --> 00:34:49.560
You're ruining 100 years of what
photography is all about.

00:34:49.560 --> 00:34:50.560
You just block them.

00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:52.599
So now
I'm at the point where I just block.

00:34:52.599 --> 00:34:54.050
That's by the way a
weakness of Flickr.

00:34:54.050 --> 00:34:57.730
If you block somebody on Flickr,
that means they can't comment on your photos

00:34:57.730 --> 00:34:59.559
but they can
still comment on the groups you're in.

00:34:59.559 --> 00:35:01.420
They can still
follow your friends and comment on there.

00:35:01.420 --> 00:35:02.940
And you have to
still see it.

00:35:02.940 --> 00:35:08.760
The nice thing about Google+ is you
wipe somebody out, they're out; they're gone.

00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:09.760
That's a good thing.

00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:14.900
That's something I've learned with photographing
online.

00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:17.339
There
are some things Flickr does really right I

00:35:17.339 --> 00:35:18.400
think.

00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:20.520
And
that I think Google really should take a look

00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:25.050
at and some
places where I think they are doing it right.

00:35:25.050 --> 00:35:29.010
I think
it's easy to blog and embed their photos right

00:35:29.010 --> 00:35:30.010
there from
the photo.

00:35:30.010 --> 00:35:31.910
You can get an embed code and put it on your
blog.

00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:35.569
Now I've been blogging some of my Google+
photos but I've had to custom create that

00:35:35.569 --> 00:35:39.490
HTML and so
myself and put that code in there.

00:35:39.490 --> 00:35:41.891
You can go to Picasa and get
some but it looks wonky and it doesn't look

00:35:41.891 --> 00:35:44.030
good.

00:35:44.030 --> 00:35:45.710
That's
a thing they do very well.

00:35:45.710 --> 00:35:50.990
I think groups have been a success
there but they have never capitalized on them.

00:35:50.990 --> 00:35:53.040
Interestingness was an interesting idea to
rank photos by

00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:55.270
social activity and the meta data around them.

00:35:55.270 --> 00:35:58.580
Flickr even
got a patent on it which I can't believe they

00:35:58.580 --> 00:36:01.620
got a
patent on that.

00:36:01.620 --> 00:36:02.680
You know they had the API.

00:36:02.680 --> 00:36:03.680
They were
there early.

00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:04.960
The Flickr blog they do a good job.

00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:06.890
The
sign in accounts with Facebook and Google

00:36:06.890 --> 00:36:09.290
I thought was a great move
that they did.

00:36:09.290 --> 00:36:13.330
25 dollars for an unlimited photos is a
great deal.

00:36:13.330 --> 00:36:15.390
In fact I think Google should think about
that.

00:36:15.390 --> 00:36:18.549
Google has, you know right now, at least with
Picasa,

00:36:18.549 --> 00:36:21.010
it's based on how much storage you use.

00:36:21.010 --> 00:36:25.089
So you know I
think for somebody like me would end up costing

00:36:25.089 --> 00:36:26.089
me
potentially.

00:36:26.089 --> 00:36:29.770
If I had the same amount as I do on Flickr
about 500 dollars a year or something like

00:36:29.770 --> 00:36:30.860
that.

00:36:30.860 --> 00:36:34.059
I don't think really that's
the best model.

00:36:34.059 --> 00:36:36.621
Photographers that are popular that are
putting a lot of photographs on there, even

00:36:36.621 --> 00:36:37.621
if they are big.

00:36:37.621 --> 00:36:38.621
I
think you want them.

00:36:38.621 --> 00:36:40.040
You want that content on the site.

00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:41.380
So you want to encourage it.

00:36:41.380 --> 00:36:45.050
Flickr's 25 for all you
can publish I think is a good deal.

00:36:45.050 --> 00:36:48.170
Flickr's got the
Getty deal which is 20 percent payout which

00:36:48.170 --> 00:36:52.950
is terrible
which Google can totally rock that.

00:36:52.950 --> 00:36:57.040
Because 20 percent
payout to photographers is terrible.

00:36:57.040 --> 00:36:58.200
Google could do
something with stock.

00:36:58.200 --> 00:36:59.750
It's a multi-billion dollar
business.

00:36:59.750 --> 00:37:00.990
I mention it a lot.

00:37:00.990 --> 00:37:04.420
But it is something with
Flickr that they have that's an advantage

00:37:04.420 --> 00:37:06.910
because I get
paid you know 500 bucks a month just for having

00:37:06.910 --> 00:37:08.960
an
account on Flickr so I'm actually getting

00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:12.309
paid because
of this Getty thing and people buy my images

00:37:12.309 --> 00:37:13.309
and use them
on Getty.

00:37:13.309 --> 00:37:14.610
I don't really have to do anything.

00:37:14.610 --> 00:37:15.620
Here you
go.

00:37:15.620 --> 00:37:17.020
Here's 200 of my images.

00:37:17.020 --> 00:37:18.099
Use them.

00:37:18.099 --> 00:37:19.099
And Getty
markets them.

00:37:19.099 --> 00:37:20.099
Getty sells them.

00:37:20.099 --> 00:37:21.099
People find them
through Getty.

00:37:21.099 --> 00:37:24.369
I think Google should maybe think about
something like that.

00:37:24.369 --> 00:37:25.520
Organization.

00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:30.480
That I think the way
they have albums is better.

00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:31.839
You can use super setter.

00:37:31.839 --> 00:37:35.640
So I have 1600 albums at Flickr sets.

00:37:35.640 --> 00:37:39.960
And I can say, anything that's
got this keyword in Occupy San Francisco on

00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:42.080
this date do
this.

00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:43.290
Make it a set.

00:37:43.290 --> 00:37:45.020
And it just automatically does it.

00:37:45.020 --> 00:37:46.941
It's kind of like smart play lists with iTunes.

00:37:46.941 --> 00:37:51.690
I think
it's a smart way to do album management.

00:37:51.690 --> 00:37:52.970
What Flickr is
doing wrong.

00:37:52.970 --> 00:37:54.190
Innovation is completely stalled.

00:37:54.190 --> 00:37:56.520
I don't
know if you guys saw the latest products they

00:37:56.520 --> 00:37:57.520
just
released.

00:37:57.520 --> 00:37:59.580
One is like an android app which is pretty
awful.

00:37:59.580 --> 00:38:01.849
The other one is they had this thing where
I can connect

00:38:01.849 --> 00:38:04.690
up with another Flickr user and we can look
at this

00:38:04.690 --> 00:38:07.490
Flickr photo and chat with each other.

00:38:07.490 --> 00:38:09.020
It's like who's
going to use that?

00:38:09.020 --> 00:38:10.020
Nobody's going to use that.

00:38:10.020 --> 00:38:11.990
I mean,
we got hangouts at Google+.

00:38:11.990 --> 00:38:14.460
I can have all these
people in a room and show the picture right

00:38:14.460 --> 00:38:16.300
there and people can see
it.

00:38:16.300 --> 00:38:21.700
So you know I mention they have bad blocking
tools.

00:38:21.700 --> 00:38:27.670
Ability to -- you know, the other issue that's
come up a

00:38:27.670 --> 00:38:31.480
little bit with Google and is sort of a controversial
hot

00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:33.500
button and I don't know the answer and I'm
sure you guys

00:38:33.500 --> 00:38:35.990
are all smart and thinking about it.

00:38:35.990 --> 00:38:40.110
What do you do
about adult-oriented content?

00:38:40.110 --> 00:38:41.890
Some people say that's a
very easy question.

00:38:41.890 --> 00:38:44.329
What Flickr has done is they've
just created filters.

00:38:44.329 --> 00:38:49.300
So if I want to do adult-oriented
content, I'll mark it as adult-oriented content.

00:38:49.300 --> 00:38:51.359
If
people opt into that thing then they can see

00:38:51.359 --> 00:38:54.020
it and if
they don't, then they don't see it.

00:38:54.020 --> 00:38:55.220
And it's filtered
out.

00:38:55.220 --> 00:38:56.819
And that will work.

00:38:56.819 --> 00:38:58.790
I don't think that's worked
for Flickr.

00:38:58.790 --> 00:39:07.099
And I think that what's happened at Flickr
is there's this ginormous underside that a

00:39:07.099 --> 00:39:10.390
lot of people
don't see because safe search is on by default

00:39:10.390 --> 00:39:12.050
so a lot
of users don't see it.

00:39:12.050 --> 00:39:16.330
But there's a huge amount of
giant underground porn on Flickr and it's

00:39:16.330 --> 00:39:17.750
all amateur
based porn.

00:39:17.750 --> 00:39:20.569
And I don't know that you want that.

00:39:20.569 --> 00:39:21.569
I
don't think you want to be -- I certainly

00:39:21.569 --> 00:39:23.300
don't think
Google wants to be associated with that.

00:39:23.300 --> 00:39:24.940
I doubt Yahoo
wants to be associated with it.

00:39:24.940 --> 00:39:27.200
I don't think they
necessarily meant for that to happen.

00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:30.000
But on the other
hand, what do you do about somebody who might

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:32.589
be a little cutting
edge, who might show a little bit of nipple

00:39:32.589 --> 00:39:34.560
because of
fine art photograph and something that probably

00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:37.800
should be
allowed to be shared between two consenting

00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:40.010
adults and
it's art.

00:39:40.010 --> 00:39:45.160
So that's a line and I don't know what the
answer is but you know that's something else

00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:47.520
to think
about.

00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:49.620
So with that, that's kind of what I wanted
to

00:39:49.620 --> 00:39:51.910
talk about with my own photography a little
bit as well

00:39:51.910 --> 00:39:55.890
as some of these other sites Flickr and Google+.

00:39:55.890 --> 00:39:58.059
I've got some of my Google+ photos that I
published

00:39:58.059 --> 00:39:59.059
recently too.

00:39:59.059 --> 00:40:04.330
That's in Seattle -- Seattle Central
Library which has wonderful architecture.

00:40:04.330 --> 00:40:06.770
That's another one from Death Valley.

00:40:06.770 --> 00:40:09.109
Lotus
Carroll who does the show with me.

00:40:09.109 --> 00:40:13.690
That was just -- I took
that photograph yesterday of a police line

00:40:13.690 --> 00:40:16.200
at Occupy San
Francisco where they arrested three people

00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:19.700
in the street
that were blocking Market Street.

00:40:19.700 --> 00:40:21.680
You know, I do a lot
of out of focus work.

00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:22.850
Man that drives people nuts.

00:40:22.850 --> 00:40:25.490
[laughter] I
put that stuff on Google+, "did you forget

00:40:25.490 --> 00:40:26.490
your
glasses?

00:40:26.490 --> 00:40:27.490
Were you drinking?

00:40:27.490 --> 00:40:31.700
This is the view I see when
I get out of the bar."

00:40:31.700 --> 00:40:34.510
You know, it's certainly an
aesthetic.

00:40:34.510 --> 00:40:36.550
Sometimes people really hate it.

00:40:36.550 --> 00:40:40.280
It's a
police officer the morning after Occupy San

00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:44.001
Francisco
when they cleared him out of there.

00:40:44.001 --> 00:40:45.001
It's an
architectural building at Fort Worth.

00:40:45.001 --> 00:40:46.240
Again, this is
something on my pinpoint.

00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:47.369
This was a point on my map.

00:40:47.369 --> 00:40:53.130
I wanted to shoot the Modern
which is the modern art museum in Fort Worth.

00:40:53.130 --> 00:40:54.520
Beautiful
architecture.

00:40:54.520 --> 00:40:56.990
There's a picture of Scott Jarvie.

00:40:56.990 --> 00:40:59.130
I'll
go crazy with the photo processing sometimes.

00:40:59.130 --> 00:41:03.730
That's a
mirror effect down the middle.

00:41:03.730 --> 00:41:07.059
A shot in Sacramento in
the rain with neon signs.

00:41:07.059 --> 00:41:08.059
I collect neon signs.

00:41:08.059 --> 00:41:11.460
I got
about 10,000 photos with neon signs.

00:41:11.460 --> 00:41:13.450
Botanical garden
in St. Louis is the best botanical garden

00:41:13.450 --> 00:41:16.250
I've ever been to
any place in my life.

00:41:16.250 --> 00:41:17.250
Wonderful stuff to shoot there.

00:41:17.250 --> 00:41:20.020
There are
two of my children.

00:41:20.020 --> 00:41:25.040
That's Kate and Holly in a
tunnel down in Los Angeles.

00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:26.420
Cable cars.

00:41:26.420 --> 00:41:27.420
Love graffiti
too.

00:41:27.420 --> 00:41:29.720
So questions.

00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:36.470
&gt;&gt;Male #4: [inaudible]

00:41:36.470 --> 00:41:43.230
&gt;&gt; Thomas Hawk: Sure.

00:41:43.230 --> 00:41:51.750
&gt;&gt;Thomas Hawk: I think very little of it is
having multi-thousand

00:41:51.750 --> 00:41:53.550
dollar camera and lens and all that.

00:41:53.550 --> 00:41:56.549
I think you can
take pictures with a camera phone and do interesting

00:41:56.549 --> 00:41:57.549
things with it.

00:41:57.549 --> 00:42:01.210
To start with you know a lot of people
probably wouldn't say this and wouldn't even

00:42:01.210 --> 00:42:03.450
like me
saying this.

00:42:03.450 --> 00:42:07.540
I think 60 to 70 percent of it is processing.

00:42:07.540 --> 00:42:09.460
So I think it kind of doesn't matter what
camera you're

00:42:09.460 --> 00:42:10.460
using.

00:42:10.460 --> 00:42:11.630
The stuff you can do today in Lightroom the
way

00:42:11.630 --> 00:42:15.060
you can change a photograph and what you can
do with it

00:42:15.060 --> 00:42:17.670
there a huge amount of it is in the processing.

00:42:17.670 --> 00:42:20.450
Particularly if you're publishing online,
you don't

00:42:20.450 --> 00:42:23.349
necessarily need a mega-resolution picture.

00:42:23.349 --> 00:42:26.040
It only can
be so big online.

00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:27.040
And people are going to see it.

00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:28.550
You're not making prints of it necessarily
when you're

00:42:28.550 --> 00:42:31.059
starting out, I don't think.

00:42:31.059 --> 00:42:34.099
So I think just getting any
camera and shooting.

00:42:34.099 --> 00:42:38.720
I do think DSLRs, you can do things
with DSLRs you can't do with a camera phone.

00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:40.540
But
a lot of people say I'm starting out I want

00:42:40.540 --> 00:42:41.540
to buy a
DSLR.

00:42:41.540 --> 00:42:42.540
Which one should I buy?

00:42:42.540 --> 00:42:45.730
Should I buy this Canon 5D Mark II, brand
new from B and H

00:42:45.730 --> 00:42:46.859
and I'll say no.

00:42:46.859 --> 00:42:47.869
You're starting out.

00:42:47.869 --> 00:42:52.780
Go to Ebay and
buy a used 20 D for you know 600 bucks and

00:42:52.780 --> 00:42:56.910
get yourself a
50 millimeter F 18 for less than 100 bucks

00:42:56.910 --> 00:42:58.420
and go out and
shoot with a cheap thing.

00:42:58.420 --> 00:43:01.470
If you like it and you're into it, you can
always sell that thing back on Ebay and not

00:43:01.470 --> 00:43:06.570
lose any money and then go out and buy a Canon
5 D Mark II when you're ready.

00:43:06.570 --> 00:43:09.480
It's kind of like I decided a
number of years ago I was going to play golf

00:43:09.480 --> 00:43:10.720
which I hate
golf.

00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:12.369
[laughter] I don't know what I was thinking.

00:43:12.369 --> 00:43:15.440
I mean golf
course how many pictures can you take of a

00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:16.580
golf course.

00:43:16.580 --> 00:43:18.560
So I went out and bought these Ping golf clubs.

00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:19.560
These are
nice.

00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:21.559
Oh yeah, I'm going to make a better golfer
with

00:43:21.559 --> 00:43:23.040
these Pings.

00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:25.110
You know, and I think I used them twice.

00:43:25.110 --> 00:43:27.790
I
ended up selling them back lost a bunch of

00:43:27.790 --> 00:43:30.260
money because
I bought them new and stuff like that.

00:43:30.260 --> 00:43:34.290
So I think with
the camera stuff, too, buy something used,

00:43:34.290 --> 00:43:36.790
I think, even.

00:43:36.790 --> 00:43:38.920
Buy
you know just a very basic setup see if you

00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:41.720
like it then
you can always go from there.

00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:43.490
I think a lot of it is the
processing.

00:43:43.490 --> 00:43:45.630
A lot of it is the eye and the time.

00:43:45.630 --> 00:43:46.630
Getting what you get.

00:43:46.630 --> 00:43:48.819
Another question back there?

00:43:48.819 --> 00:43:51.789
&gt;&gt; Male #5: [inaudible]

00:43:51.789 --> 00:43:54.760
&gt;&gt; Thomas Hawk: Okay.

00:43:54.760 --> 00:43:55.760
Yeah.

00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:56.960
I've got a lot of photographs.

00:43:56.960 --> 00:44:01.099
So many
photographs that, you know, I have at this

00:44:01.099 --> 00:44:05.730
point over one
million frames of raw files.

00:44:05.730 --> 00:44:08.250
So Lightroom can't really
manage that many.

00:44:08.250 --> 00:44:09.859
It just bogs down and goes too slow.

00:44:09.859 --> 00:44:11.820
So
what I do.

00:44:11.820 --> 00:44:15.980
Everything for any day is in a folder by that
day.

00:44:15.980 --> 00:44:21.460
So 2011 hyphen 12 hyphen 08 and everything
from

00:44:21.460 --> 00:44:25.619
that day goes in that folder and I keep everything
on to

00:44:25.619 --> 00:44:28.090
be processed and I'm two years behind on my
processing

00:44:28.090 --> 00:44:29.090
right now.

00:44:29.090 --> 00:44:35.180
So I'm working on basically January 2010
right now is how far behind.

00:44:35.180 --> 00:44:38.059
But I do jump forward and
do some Death Valley shots and things like

00:44:38.059 --> 00:44:39.059
that.

00:44:39.059 --> 00:44:42.380
So I do skip ahead a little bit
sometimes.

00:44:42.380 --> 00:44:47.290
But for the most part I've got my to be
processed and my archived.

00:44:47.290 --> 00:44:49.630
And my to be processed are
all in folders by dates.

00:44:49.630 --> 00:44:51.560
I'll bring them to my Mac.

00:44:51.560 --> 00:44:53.490
I'll import them into my Lightroom.

00:44:53.490 --> 00:44:56.319
I'll work on them;
I'll save the file.

00:44:56.319 --> 00:45:00.349
The catalog file for that folder
once I make my changes in the Lightroom.

00:45:00.349 --> 00:45:02.220
Export those
files as JPEG.

00:45:02.220 --> 00:45:05.010
Then it goes in my archive folder.

00:45:05.010 --> 00:45:06.820
So I
already done that day.

00:45:06.820 --> 00:45:10.950
And then I'll just keep them by
dates and bring them on my hard drive as I

00:45:10.950 --> 00:45:12.990
process them
then take them back off when I am done.

00:45:12.990 --> 00:45:13.990
Question?

00:45:13.990 --> 00:45:14.990
&gt;&gt;Male #6: [inaudible]

00:45:14.990 --> 00:45:17.410
&gt;&gt; Thomas Hawk: I
only shoot raw.

00:45:17.410 --> 00:45:20.300
I don't really see any reason to shoot
JPEG myself.

00:45:20.300 --> 00:45:22.740
I'm going to process everything.

00:45:22.740 --> 00:45:25.890
I can do
more with a raw file than I can with a JPEG

00:45:25.890 --> 00:45:26.890
file.

00:45:26.890 --> 00:45:27.890
Particularly I believe a lot of it is in the
post

00:45:27.890 --> 00:45:28.890
production.

00:45:28.890 --> 00:45:32.819
That scene did not look like that when I
took that picture.

00:45:32.819 --> 00:45:35.880
These were taken seconds apart but
they still look very different.

00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:40.859
But I have a lot more things I
can do with raw files.

00:45:40.859 --> 00:45:47.480
This is actually the exactly same
frame that looks three ways, actually four

00:45:47.480 --> 00:45:48.480
ways.

00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:50.680
This is
exact same raw file for all four of those

00:45:50.680 --> 00:45:55.230
photographs.

00:45:55.230 --> 00:45:56.259
So other questions?

00:45:56.259 --> 00:46:00.819
&gt;&gt; Male #6: Do you shoot typically resolution
to keep the files.

00:46:00.819 --> 00:46:02.069
&gt;&gt; Thomas Hawk: No.

00:46:02.069 --> 00:46:04.950
I shoot at the highest possible raw resolution.

00:46:04.950 --> 00:46:08.720
Storage is so cheap these days there's just
no reason why

00:46:08.720 --> 00:46:09.720
even a 64.

00:46:09.720 --> 00:46:11.510
I can put a 64 gigabyte card in my camera.

00:46:11.510 --> 00:46:13.020
They're not that much money.

00:46:13.020 --> 00:46:15.040
I can off load it; hard drives are cheap.

00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:17.320
There's just no reason not
to get the best stuff.

00:46:17.320 --> 00:46:19.780
And I don't throw any files away
even if I don't like the file.

00:46:19.780 --> 00:46:24.010
I save it because you may
be able to do something with it in the future.

00:46:24.010 --> 00:46:26.099
A lot of
my shots from three years ago, "ah, that's

00:46:26.099 --> 00:46:27.490
too noisy; I
don't want it."

00:46:27.490 --> 00:46:30.440
And then Adobe Lightroom 3 comes out
with this great noise reduction technology

00:46:30.440 --> 00:46:32.890
so now all of
a sudden I can salvage some old shots.

00:46:32.890 --> 00:46:33.890
Question?

00:46:33.890 --> 00:46:38.460
&gt;&gt;Male #7: [inaudible] How do you get colors
on Google+?

00:46:38.460 --> 00:46:39.980
&gt;&gt; Thomas Hawk: Google+?

00:46:39.980 --> 00:46:44.540
&gt;&gt; Male #: Places like -- none of my friends
are actually.

00:46:44.540 --> 00:46:46.059
I
have friends.

00:46:46.059 --> 00:46:47.059
[inaudible]

00:46:47.059 --> 00:46:50.720
&gt;&gt; Thomas Hawk: What you do is you show up
to Vic Gundotra's office with a big

00:46:50.720 --> 00:46:52.400
suitcase full of money [laughter].

00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:54.710
&gt;&gt; Female #2: True story.

00:46:54.710 --> 00:46:56.450
&gt;&gt; Thomas Hawk: No.

00:46:56.450 --> 00:47:01.780
You know, I mean, obviously I am on the
recommended user list for Google+ and that

00:47:01.780 --> 00:47:03.640
adds a lot
of people.

00:47:03.640 --> 00:47:07.890
As far as Google+ goes I did get on very
very early.

00:47:07.890 --> 00:47:10.780
You know, I obviously I was very interested
in this photography space.

00:47:10.780 --> 00:47:15.900
I've been down here having
lunch with Brian a year before Google+ even

00:47:15.900 --> 00:47:17.280
launched.

00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:20.020
Having no idea what you guys were up to even.

00:47:20.020 --> 00:47:21.470
But I've
had a huge interest.

00:47:21.470 --> 00:47:23.880
I was a big user on Google Buzz
photography.

00:47:23.880 --> 00:47:26.690
I was very interested in photography with
Google.

00:47:26.690 --> 00:47:30.390
So I know when Brian invited me to the site
the

00:47:30.390 --> 00:47:33.359
day it was open for the beta so I jumped right
on.

00:47:33.359 --> 00:47:34.470
I
said this is great.

00:47:34.470 --> 00:47:35.470
I love it.

00:47:35.470 --> 00:47:37.900
So I basically went to
my network which is a lot of people on the

00:47:37.900 --> 00:47:40.319
social photo
sharing space on Flickr, on Twitter, on everywhere

00:47:40.319 --> 00:47:42.420
else, and said hey you've
got to get here.

00:47:42.420 --> 00:47:43.800
Blog posts.

00:47:43.800 --> 00:47:48.280
So I pulled I think a lot
of my own friends, photographer friends, into

00:47:48.280 --> 00:47:50.070
Google+.

00:47:50.070 --> 00:47:52.109
And I got on early so I was able to build
up an early

00:47:52.109 --> 00:47:54.580
following and circles get shared so you're
in

00:47:54.580 --> 00:47:58.670
those and you get more and then you guys did
the recommended user list and so

00:47:58.670 --> 00:48:01.210
I'm on that as a photographer.

00:48:01.210 --> 00:48:03.950
So I think you know
there's a lot of ways that you end up with

00:48:03.950 --> 00:48:05.940
a lot of
followers.

00:48:05.940 --> 00:48:08.860
Certainly the recommended list is a huge
thing.

00:48:08.860 --> 00:48:12.819
I mean Trey and I both are on the picks sections
of that list.

00:48:12.819 --> 00:48:14.670
That accounts for a lot of people.

00:48:14.670 --> 00:48:16.599
I
think being active, too.

00:48:16.599 --> 00:48:18.240
People want to see you active on
the site.

00:48:18.240 --> 00:48:19.240
They want to see you in hangouts.

00:48:19.240 --> 00:48:21.880
They want
to see you an active part of the community.

00:48:21.880 --> 00:48:26.130
We're doing
this new hangout videocasts stuff like that

00:48:26.130 --> 00:48:27.589
is great.

00:48:27.589 --> 00:48:28.589
Visibility.

00:48:28.589 --> 00:48:30.020
But just being active.

00:48:30.020 --> 00:48:33.270
You know and I had a
big following coming in.

00:48:33.270 --> 00:48:37.780
So I had you know -- nowhere
near the number of followers in Google but

00:48:37.780 --> 00:48:40.089
I was one of
the most followed accounts on Flickr, for

00:48:40.089 --> 00:48:41.089
instance.

00:48:41.089 --> 00:48:42.790
So I
had all these people I could evangelize to

00:48:42.790 --> 00:48:44.410
Google+
and say come on over.

00:48:44.410 --> 00:48:46.559
So I was able to bring in a lot of
these people.

00:48:46.559 --> 00:48:51.829
Sort of have a head start where somebody's
just starting out they don't have a big network

00:48:51.829 --> 00:48:53.039
to bring
in.

00:48:53.039 --> 00:48:56.089
So I think those were kind of all factors.

00:48:56.089 --> 00:48:58.180
I'm very
active on it.

00:48:58.180 --> 00:48:59.260
Question?

00:48:59.260 --> 00:49:02.500
&gt;&gt;Male #8: [inaudible]

00:49:02.500 --> 00:49:05.740
&gt;&gt; Thomas Hawk: Yeah.

00:49:05.740 --> 00:49:06.740
I like Lightroom.

00:49:06.740 --> 00:49:08.039
I think Lightroom is
pretty easy.

00:49:08.039 --> 00:49:12.030
There's a lot of online tutorials that are
free that will show you how to do it.

00:49:12.030 --> 00:49:14.340
I think spend some
time.

00:49:14.340 --> 00:49:16.040
Even some of the stuff these like hangouts
on

00:49:16.040 --> 00:49:17.420
Google+.

00:49:17.420 --> 00:49:19.040
Hang out with Scott Jarvie.

00:49:19.040 --> 00:49:21.310
Scott Jarvie
is an easy guy to get a hold of.

00:49:21.310 --> 00:49:23.380
He hangs out all
the time.

00:49:23.380 --> 00:49:27.900
Look for Scott Jarvie on a hangout even if
he's not processing.

00:49:27.900 --> 00:49:30.690
Scott's like processing like 50
percent of the time and he hangs out all the

00:49:30.690 --> 00:49:33.880
time but
just say hey Scott, you mind processing this

00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:34.880
photo?

00:49:34.880 --> 00:49:36.109
And
he'll be like yeah sure, and there you go.

00:49:36.109 --> 00:49:37.120
[laughter] And he'll
jump right in.

00:49:37.120 --> 00:49:38.410
And he's very good.

00:49:38.410 --> 00:49:40.030
But you can see and
go, "hey, what did you just do there?

00:49:40.030 --> 00:49:42.020
What did you brush
there?"

00:49:42.020 --> 00:49:43.190
I think Lightroom.

00:49:43.190 --> 00:49:45.339
There's a lot of people that
will spend eight hours on a photograph.

00:49:45.339 --> 00:49:46.569
They'll bring it
into PhotoShop.

00:49:46.569 --> 00:49:48.039
They'll do 18 different layers.

00:49:48.039 --> 00:49:49.849
They'll do all kinds of things.

00:49:49.849 --> 00:49:50.849
I don't do that.

00:49:50.849 --> 00:49:52.890
Guys
like Jarvie don't do that.

00:49:52.890 --> 00:49:58.860
I think that, you know, I think
that you can pick it up on tutorials.

00:49:58.860 --> 00:50:00.040
You can pick it up
online.

00:50:00.040 --> 00:50:05.430
You can pick it up in the community.

00:50:05.430 --> 00:50:08.250
So I think
just go with that way.

00:50:08.250 --> 00:50:10.910
I think hangouts are a great way.

00:50:10.910 --> 00:50:16.089
Other quick question?

00:50:16.089 --> 00:50:21.280
&gt;&gt;Male #9: [inaudible]

00:50:21.280 --> 00:50:26.460
&gt;&gt;Thomas Hawk: Yeah.

00:50:26.460 --> 00:50:30.050
Again so much of it post processing.

00:50:30.050 --> 00:50:33.530
I mean,
you can take a photograph, you know let's

00:50:33.530 --> 00:50:35.990
say this
photograph right here.

00:50:35.990 --> 00:50:39.359
And we can go to the develop
module and we can go up here to our temperature

00:50:39.359 --> 00:50:41.740
on the
white balance and we can make it look like

00:50:41.740 --> 00:50:44.650
this or we can
make it look like that.

00:50:44.650 --> 00:50:46.450
Very hot; very cold.

00:50:46.450 --> 00:50:48.010
You can
pretty much.

00:50:48.010 --> 00:50:51.690
You have a lot of control after the fact
with that.

00:50:51.690 --> 00:50:54.340
So a lot of this stuff, should I be on this
setting, should I be on that setting on the

00:50:54.340 --> 00:50:55.340
camera.

00:50:55.340 --> 00:50:56.900
A lot
of people kind of come in and say why did

00:50:56.900 --> 00:51:01.900
you shoot that
ISO 800?

00:51:01.900 --> 00:51:04.420
I mean ISO 800, 400, 200, 1600, what's the
difference.

00:51:04.420 --> 00:51:08.069
Cannon 5 D Mark II can go up to 6400.

00:51:08.069 --> 00:51:09.359
But there's really.

00:51:09.359 --> 00:51:11.589
I
don't think in the camera actually matters

00:51:11.589 --> 00:51:14.400
quite as much
as a lot of people do.

00:51:14.400 --> 00:51:18.220
I think a lot of it can be done
in processing after the fact.

00:51:18.220 --> 00:51:23.349
You know, I know a lot of
people will take more time and set up shots

00:51:23.349 --> 00:51:27.089
and do
different things with stuff in camera but

00:51:27.089 --> 00:51:28.810
I don't.

00:51:28.810 --> 00:51:31.920
So
and, you know, again I think to learn processing

00:51:31.920 --> 00:51:33.960
find some
interesting people.

00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:35.079
Karen Hutton is here.

00:51:35.079 --> 00:51:36.480
Hang out with
Karen.

00:51:36.480 --> 00:51:37.710
Make her process a photo for you.

00:51:37.710 --> 00:51:38.710
She's a master.

00:51:38.710 --> 00:51:40.039
She's quite good.

00:51:40.039 --> 00:51:41.289
You know.

00:51:41.289 --> 00:51:43.109
She did a great shot of Lotus in
the car.

00:51:43.109 --> 00:51:44.880
I don't know how you made her hair blow.

00:51:44.880 --> 00:51:46.270
It
wasn't even really blowing in real life.

00:51:46.270 --> 00:51:48.780
It's like we had a fan there or something.

00:51:48.780 --> 00:51:51.700
&gt;&gt;Karen: [inaudible]
&gt;&gt;Thomas Hawk: There's some stuff . I don't

00:51:51.700 --> 00:51:53.520
know what she did
there.

00:51:53.520 --> 00:51:54.660
But, you know.

00:51:54.660 --> 00:51:55.660
Yeah.

00:51:55.660 --> 00:51:56.660
It's magic.

00:51:56.660 --> 00:51:58.599
But find
people that you like their processing.

00:51:58.599 --> 00:51:59.599
You'd be
surprised.

00:51:59.599 --> 00:52:01.039
People ask me in hangouts all the time.

00:52:01.039 --> 00:52:02.540
Will you
process a photo.

00:52:02.540 --> 00:52:03.540
Sure.

00:52:03.540 --> 00:52:06.869
I'll process this.

00:52:06.869 --> 00:52:08.710
I don't
think processing is that hard.

00:52:08.710 --> 00:52:12.280
I mean there are some
things you can do to be very, very complicated.

00:52:12.280 --> 00:52:16.440
And make
it harder than it has to be.

00:52:16.440 --> 00:52:23.310
But other questions?

00:52:23.310 --> 00:52:30.170
&gt;&gt;Male #10: [inaudible]

00:52:30.170 --> 00:52:37.040
&gt;&gt; Thomas Hawk: Okay.

00:52:37.040 --> 00:52:39.329
Yeah.

00:52:39.329 --> 00:52:40.329
You know.

00:52:40.329 --> 00:52:41.329
Yeah.

00:52:41.329 --> 00:52:42.329
And I have the same
problem.

00:52:42.329 --> 00:52:44.400
Flagging takes a lot of time.

00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:45.400
If I have a
shoot.

00:52:45.400 --> 00:52:50.180
I wonder what I've got in my library right
now.

00:52:50.180 --> 00:52:51.410
Yeah.

00:52:51.410 --> 00:52:54.900
Nothing really worth showing there.

00:52:54.900 --> 00:52:57.619
You know, if
I have a shoot -- yeah, I can take.

00:52:57.619 --> 00:53:00.859
If I take 5,000
photographs and end up processing 1,000, the

00:53:00.859 --> 00:53:04.339
time to go
through each 5,000 and flag them all.

00:53:04.339 --> 00:53:07.329
I mean, there's
some ways you can speed that up a little bit.

00:53:07.329 --> 00:53:09.290
Flash
memory in the computer instead of a regular

00:53:09.290 --> 00:53:11.240
hard drive.

00:53:11.240 --> 00:53:13.089
Things like that make Lightroom go a little
bit faster.

00:53:13.089 --> 00:53:14.319
Make sure
you have enough ram.

00:53:14.319 --> 00:53:18.670
8 Gigabytes of ram, to try to get it to go
a little bit faster.

00:53:18.670 --> 00:53:22.150
&gt;&gt; Male #10: It's not the computer; it's the
decision making.

00:53:22.150 --> 00:53:23.200
&gt;&gt; Thomas Hawk: That's true too.

00:53:23.200 --> 00:53:24.680
That's just a manual process.

00:53:24.680 --> 00:53:26.480
I think we all go
through that.

00:53:26.480 --> 00:53:29.240
It's one of my least favorite parts of
processing.

00:53:29.240 --> 00:53:32.070
Typically in a day I'll shoot anywhere on
a

00:53:32.070 --> 00:53:36.020
trip anywhere from 3,000 to 6,000 frames and
to have to

00:53:36.020 --> 00:53:39.820
go through those frames one by one and flag,
flag, flag.

00:53:39.820 --> 00:53:41.900
But once you've got them flagged you can start
and

00:53:41.900 --> 00:53:42.900
process them.

00:53:42.900 --> 00:53:43.900
So

00:53:43.900 --> 00:53:46.170
&gt;&gt;Male presenter: [inaudible] we have time
for one last question.

00:53:46.170 --> 00:53:53.670
&gt;&gt; Male #11: [inaudible] What fraction of
the photos do you end up being able to keep?

00:53:53.670 --> 00:53:57.140
&gt;&gt;Thomas Hawk: I probably keep 20 percent.

00:53:57.140 --> 00:54:00.300
[several audience members respond inaudibly]
Yeah.

00:54:00.300 --> 00:54:02.750
I keep about 20 percent.

00:54:02.750 --> 00:54:03.750
Great.

00:54:03.750 --> 00:54:07.780
Yeah, thanks for having me, guys.

00:54:07.780 --> 00:54:11.079
I
really enjoyed it.

00:54:11.079 --> 00:54:12.089
[Applause]
