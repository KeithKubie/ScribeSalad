00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.675
- [Voiceover] Before we
go in-depth on meiosis,

00:00:02.675 --> 00:00:04.384
I want to do a very high level overview

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.529
comparing mitosis to meiosis.

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:10.238
So, in mitosis, this is all a review,

00:00:10.271 --> 00:00:11.953
if you've watched the mitosis video,

00:00:12.691 --> 00:00:14.566
in mitosis, we start with a cell,

00:00:16.884 --> 00:00:19.277
that has a diploid number of chromosomes.

00:00:19.277 --> 00:00:22.244
I'll just write 2n to show
it has a diploid number.

00:00:22.454 --> 00:00:24.753
For human beings, this
would be 46 chromosomes.

00:00:29.576 --> 00:00:33.425
46 for humans, you get 23
chromosomes from your mother,

00:00:33.659 --> 00:00:36.718
23 chromosomes from your
father or you can say

00:00:36.906 --> 00:00:41.906
you have 23 homologous pairs,
which leads to 46 chromosomes.

00:00:42.034 --> 00:00:44.588
Now after the process of mitosis happens

00:00:44.588 --> 00:00:47.072
and you have your
cytokinesis and all the rest,

00:00:47.072 --> 00:00:49.515
you end up with two cells that each

00:00:49.518 --> 00:00:52.380
have the same genetic
information as the original.

00:00:53.325 --> 00:00:55.995
So you now have two cells

00:00:56.605 --> 00:00:59.617
that each have the diploid
number of chromosomes.

00:00:59.617 --> 00:01:04.006
So, 2n and 2n.

00:01:04.236 --> 00:01:05.807
And now each of these cells

00:01:05.901 --> 00:01:07.554
are just like this cell was,

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:10.452
it can go through interphase again.

00:01:10.452 --> 00:01:14.882
It grows and it can replicate its DNA

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:16.846
and centrosomes and grow some more

00:01:16.846 --> 00:01:19.285
then each of these can
go through mitosis again.

00:01:19.285 --> 00:01:21.198
And this is actually how

00:01:21.198 --> 00:01:23.628
most of the cells in your body grow.

00:01:23.628 --> 00:01:27.783
This is how you turn from a
single cell organism into you,

00:01:27.783 --> 00:01:30.428
or for the most part, into you.

00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:32.046
So that is mitosis.

00:01:32.166 --> 00:01:33.239
It's a cycle.

00:01:33.239 --> 00:01:35.035
After each of these
things go through mitosis,

00:01:36.305 --> 00:01:37.459
they can then go through

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:38.600
the entire cell cycle again.

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.852
Let me write this a little bit neater.

00:01:40.852 --> 00:01:43.267
Mitosis, that s was a
little bit hard to read.

00:01:43.927 --> 00:01:45.795
Now what happens in meiosis?

00:01:45.975 --> 00:01:48.657
What happens in meiosis?

00:01:48.657 --> 00:01:49.681
I'll do that over here.

00:01:50.701 --> 00:01:53.691
In meiosis, something
slightly different happens

00:01:54.231 --> 00:01:55.757
and it happens in two phases.

00:01:58.183 --> 00:02:00.316
You will start with a cell

00:02:00.316 --> 00:02:02.426
that has a diploid number of chromosomes.

00:02:03.566 --> 00:02:05.755
So you will start with a cell

00:02:06.035 --> 00:02:09.188
that has a diploid number of chromosomes.

00:02:09.576 --> 00:02:12.081
And in it's interphase, it
also replicates its DNA.

00:02:12.587 --> 00:02:15.049
And then it goes through
something called Meiosis One.

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:16.790
And in Meiosis One,

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.846
what you end up with is two cells

00:02:18.887 --> 00:02:21.668
that now have haploid
number of chromosomes.

00:02:23.004 --> 00:02:25.657
So you end up with two cells,

00:02:26.124 --> 00:02:28.894
You now have two cells that each have a

00:02:28.894 --> 00:02:30.458
haploid number of chromosomes.

00:02:31.207 --> 00:02:34.135
So you have n and you have n.

00:02:34.345 --> 00:02:35.758
So if we're talking about human beings,

00:02:35.758 --> 00:02:37.244
you have 46 chromosomes here,

00:02:37.244 --> 00:02:40.935
and now you have 23
chromosomes in this nucleus.

00:02:40.935 --> 00:02:42.909
And now you have 23 in this nucleus.

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:44.558
But you're still not done.

00:02:45.058 --> 00:02:47.371
Then each of these will
go through a phase,

00:02:47.371 --> 00:02:49.689
which I'll talk about
in a second, which is

00:02:49.813 --> 00:02:52.161
very similar to mitosis, which will

00:02:53.351 --> 00:02:55.791
duplicate this entire cell into two.

00:02:56.141 --> 00:02:57.466
So actually, let me do it like this.

00:02:57.869 --> 00:02:59.017
So now, this one,

00:03:01.234 --> 00:03:04.473
you're going to have four cells

00:03:04.572 --> 00:03:06.740
that each have the haploid number

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:10.983
that each have the haploid
number of chromosomes.

00:03:11.554 --> 00:03:13.864
And they don't all
necessarily have the same

00:03:13.864 --> 00:03:15.023
genetic informatioin anymore.

00:03:15.023 --> 00:03:17.151
Because as we go through this first phase,

00:03:17.151 --> 00:03:19.767
right over here of meiosis,
and this first phase

00:03:19.767 --> 00:03:23.157
here you go from diploid to
haploid, right over here,

00:03:23.157 --> 00:03:24.515
this is called Meiosis One.

00:03:25.385 --> 00:03:28.245
Meiosis One,

00:03:29.205 --> 00:03:32.551
you're essentially splitting
the homologous pairs

00:03:32.551 --> 00:03:34.618
and so this one might get some of the

00:03:36.738 --> 00:03:38.116
ones that you originally
got from your father,

00:03:38.116 --> 00:03:39.567
and some that you originally
got from your mother,

00:03:39.867 --> 00:03:41.587
some that you originally
got from your father,

00:03:41.587 --> 00:03:43.437
some that you originally
got from your mother,

00:03:43.437 --> 00:03:45.938
they split randomly,
but each homogolous pair

00:03:46.898 --> 00:03:48.665
gets split up.

00:03:48.992 --> 00:03:51.437
And then in this phase, Meiosis Two,

00:03:51.992 --> 00:03:54.587
so this phase right over
here is called Meiosis Two,

00:03:55.483 --> 00:03:56.586
it's very similar

00:03:56.936 --> 00:04:00.604
to mitosis, except your now
dealing with cells that start off

00:04:00.604 --> 00:04:02.485
with the haploid number.

00:04:02.485 --> 00:04:05.155
It's important to realize
that meiosis is not a cycle.

00:04:05.155 --> 00:04:08.513
These cells that you have
over here, these are gametes.

00:04:09.153 --> 00:04:10.263
This are sex cells.

00:04:10.845 --> 00:04:12.182
These are gametes.

00:04:12.675 --> 00:04:14.858
This can now be used in fertilization.

00:04:14.858 --> 00:04:18.387
If we're talking about, if
you're male, this is happening

00:04:18.387 --> 00:04:22.449
in your testes, and these
are going to be sperm cells

00:04:22.467 --> 00:04:26.317
If you are female, this is
happening in your ovaries

00:04:26.317 --> 00:04:28.146
and these are going to be egg cells.

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:32.804
If you a tree, this could be
pollen or it could be an ovul.

00:04:34.115 --> 00:04:36.542
But these are used for fertilization.

00:04:37.197 --> 00:04:39.775
These will fuse together
in sexual reproduction

00:04:39.775 --> 00:04:44.775
to get to a fertilized
egg, which then can undergo

00:04:44.813 --> 00:04:48.180
mitosis to create an
entirely new organism.

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:49.598
So not a cycle here,

00:04:49.662 --> 00:04:52.827
although these will find sex cells

00:04:52.827 --> 00:04:57.470
from another organism and fuse with them

00:04:57.488 --> 00:04:59.229
and those can turn into another organism.

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:01.730
And I guess the whole
circle of life starts again.

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:04.005
But it's not the case with
mitosis where this can keep

00:05:04.005 --> 00:05:05.445
going and going, going.

00:05:05.445 --> 00:05:10.132
This cell is just like this
cell, while these sex cells

00:05:10.132 --> 00:05:12.473
are differeent than this
one right over here.

00:05:12.473 --> 00:05:14.748
Now, where does this happen in the body?

00:05:14.748 --> 00:05:16.582
We've talked about this
in previous videos.

00:05:16.582 --> 00:05:19.949
These are your somatic
cells right over here.

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:22.503
These are the ones that make
up the bulk of your body,

00:05:22.503 --> 00:05:23.734
somatic cells.

00:05:23.904 --> 00:05:25.452
And where is this happening?

00:05:25.496 --> 00:05:27.582
Well, this is happening in germ cells,

00:05:27.582 --> 00:05:29.764
As we mentioned, if you're
male it's in your tesis

00:05:29.764 --> 00:05:32.428
and if you're female it's in your ovaries.

00:05:32.767 --> 00:05:36.025
And germ cells actually
can undergo mitosis

00:05:36.075 --> 00:05:38.540
to produce other germ
cells that have a diploid

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:42.046
number of chromosomes, or they can undergo

00:05:42.046 --> 00:05:46.179
meiosis in order to
produce sperm or egg cells

00:05:46.179 --> 00:05:48.338
in order to produce gametes.
