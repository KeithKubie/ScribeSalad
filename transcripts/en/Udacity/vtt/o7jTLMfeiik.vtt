00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.030
It's time to update the weather app to
cache the app shell on install, and

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:09.540
clean the old resources from
the cache in the activate event.

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:10.510
Here's what I want you to do.

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:15.200
In your app JS file,
register a new service worker,

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.670
but only if server workers
are available in the browser.

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:24.280
Then create an install event
handler in the service worker

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:27.430
that caches the resources required for
the app shell.

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:32.220
Next, create an active event
handler in the service worker

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.640
that removes old
resources from the cache.

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.360
Next, create a fetch event handler

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.640
in the service worker that attempts
to return content from the cache but

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.090
falls back to the network
if it's not available.

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:47.990
When you've completed this step,

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:52.595
your app should now cache its app
show on first load and then for

00:00:52.595 --> 00:00:57.715
subsequent loads return all of the app
shell resources from the cache.

00:00:57.715 --> 00:01:03.157
If one of the resources change, the
cache should update on the next reload.

00:01:03.157 --> 00:01:07.657
Be sure to compare your app to
the link in the instructor notes below

00:01:07.657 --> 00:01:10.877
to make sure it works exactly the same.

00:01:10.877 --> 00:01:13.977
And don't forget to try your
app in multiple browsers.
