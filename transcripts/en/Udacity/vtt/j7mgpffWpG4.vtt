All right, you're done.

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:05.408
Congratulations on finishing this
lesson, we've learned a lot.

00:00:05.408 --> 00:00:08.290
We started of with what exactly
a content provider is, and

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:09.570
why they're useful.

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.450
Next, we learned about some
standard Google content providers

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.210
such as the Calendar content provider,
and the Contacts content provider.

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:18.250
After which, we got our hands dirty, and

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:21.930
we made a simple app using
the User Dictionary content provider.

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.980
I hope you've enjoyed this lesson,
and see you in class next time.

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:25.480
Bye.
