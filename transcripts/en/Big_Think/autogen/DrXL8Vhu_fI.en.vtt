dark matter is the vast majority of a
mass of the entire universe it's the

mass of the entire universe it's the
 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.120

matter has to be pretty cold but it
 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.470

could be a little bit warm and that
 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.959
could be a little bit warm and that
would make a great difference to what we

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969
would make a great difference to what we
 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.779

being pretty cold is enough to allow us

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210
being pretty cold is enough to allow us
 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.420
being pretty cold is enough to allow us
to predict in great detail the

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.420
galaxies but the small scale structure
of the universe really depends in more

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430
of the universe really depends in more
 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.450
of the universe really depends in more
detail on the nature of the dark matter

detail on the nature of the dark matter
 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.620
detail on the nature of the dark matter
also the dark matter can possibly

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630
also the dark matter can possibly
 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.490
also the dark matter can possibly
interact with itself and annihilate and

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500
interact with itself and annihilate and
 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.870
interact with itself and annihilate and
two dark matter particles come together

two dark matter particles come together
 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.850
two dark matter particles come together
and then make a lot of other stuff and

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860
and then make a lot of other stuff and
 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.859
and then make a lot of other stuff and
this could have played an extremely

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869
this could have played an extremely
 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.139
this could have played an extremely
important role in the early universe and

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149
important role in the early universe and
 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.569
important role in the early universe and
it could still be producing effects that

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579
it could still be producing effects that
 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.999
it could still be producing effects that
our sensitive detectors in space and on

our sensitive detectors in space and on
 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.130
our sensitive detectors in space and on
the ground can come find experimentally

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140
the ground can come find experimentally

the ground can come find experimentally
we haven't yet seen clear evidence for

we haven't yet seen clear evidence for
 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.359
we haven't yet seen clear evidence for
any of these things although there are a

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369
any of these things although there are a
 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:06.740
any of these things although there are a
number of experiments that are reporting

number of experiments that are reporting
 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.949
number of experiments that are reporting
tentative detections so it feels very

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959
tentative detections so it feels very
 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.540
tentative detections so it feels very
much like we're on the verge

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550
much like we're on the verge
 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.330
much like we're on the verge
of major breakthroughs in trying to

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340
of major breakthroughs in trying to
 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.370
of major breakthroughs in trying to
understand the nature of the dark matter

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380
understand the nature of the dark matter
 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.760
understand the nature of the dark matter
if we finally do figure out the nature

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770
if we finally do figure out the nature
 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.840
if we finally do figure out the nature
of the dark matter we will then have a

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850
of the dark matter we will then have a
 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.690
of the dark matter we will then have a
single unified picture of the origin and

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700
single unified picture of the origin and
 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.290
single unified picture of the origin and
evolution of the entire universe one

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300
evolution of the entire universe one
 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.360
evolution of the entire universe one
that scientists all over the world have

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370
that scientists all over the world have
 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.480
that scientists all over the world have
contributed to and that can become the

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490
contributed to and that can become the
 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:39.500
contributed to and that can become the
basis for a shared origin story that

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510
basis for a shared origin story that
 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.420
basis for a shared origin story that
could possibly solidify the bonds of

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430
could possibly solidify the bonds of
 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.860
could possibly solidify the bonds of
humankind we've never had a single

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870
humankind we've never had a single
 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.650
humankind we've never had a single
picture thoroughly supported by

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660
picture thoroughly supported by
 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.420
picture thoroughly supported by
scientific evidence and we're coming

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430
scientific evidence and we're coming
 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.510
scientific evidence and we're coming
close to it now so I think we scientists

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520
close to it now so I think we scientists
 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.990
close to it now so I think we scientists
are feeling very hopeful that we're

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000
are feeling very hopeful that we're
 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.320
are feeling very hopeful that we're
about to cross this threshold and have a

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330
about to cross this threshold and have a
 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.840
about to cross this threshold and have a
complete understanding of the origin and

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850
complete understanding of the origin and
 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.700
complete understanding of the origin and
evolution of the universe and of course

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:04.710
evolution of the universe and of course
 

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:07.580
evolution of the universe and of course
we're also coming to a much better

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590
we're also coming to a much better
 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.370
we're also coming to a much better
understanding of the evolution of life

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380
understanding of the evolution of life
 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.120
understanding of the evolution of life
so these last decades of the 20th

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130
so these last decades of the 20th
 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:15.860
so these last decades of the 20th
century in first decades of the 21st

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870
century in first decades of the 21st
 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.410
century in first decades of the 21st
century are a real turning point I think

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420
century are a real turning point I think
 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.340
century are a real turning point I think
and our understanding of how we got here
