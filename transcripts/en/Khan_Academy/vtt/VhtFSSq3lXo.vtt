00:00:00.507 --> 00:00:01.653
- [Voiceover] Let's
continue thinking about

00:00:01.653 --> 00:00:04.212
partial derivatives of vector fields.

00:00:04.212 --> 00:00:06.101
This is one of those things
that's pretty good practice

00:00:06.101 --> 00:00:07.512
for some important concepts coming up

00:00:07.512 --> 00:00:09.574
in multivariable calc,
and it's also just good

00:00:09.574 --> 00:00:11.759
to sit down and take a complicated thing

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.344
and kind of break it down piece by piece.

00:00:14.344 --> 00:00:17.030
So a vector field like
the one I just showed

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:19.586
is represented by a
vector-valued function,

00:00:19.586 --> 00:00:21.696
and since it's two-dimensional, it'll have

00:00:21.696 --> 00:00:23.905
some kind of two-dimensional input.

00:00:23.905 --> 00:00:26.081
And the output will be a vector,

00:00:26.081 --> 00:00:28.725
each of whose components
is some kind of function

00:00:28.725 --> 00:00:29.872
of x and y, right?

00:00:29.872 --> 00:00:33.962
So I'll just write P of
x, y for that x-component

00:00:33.962 --> 00:00:36.879
and Q of x, y for that y-component.

00:00:38.045 --> 00:00:42.437
And each of these are just
scalar-valued functions.

00:00:42.437 --> 00:00:45.513
It's actually quite common to
use P and Q for these values.

00:00:45.513 --> 00:00:47.749
It's one of those things where
sometimes you'll even see

00:00:47.749 --> 00:00:49.378
a theorem about vector calculus

00:00:49.378 --> 00:00:50.615
in terms of just P and Q,

00:00:50.615 --> 00:00:52.658
kind of leaving it understood
to the reader that,

00:00:52.658 --> 00:00:55.398
yeah, P and Q always refer
to the x and y components

00:00:55.398 --> 00:00:57.448
of the output of a vector field.

00:00:57.448 --> 00:00:59.985
And in this specific case,
the function that I chose,

00:00:59.985 --> 00:01:01.842
it's actually the one that
I used in the last video.

00:01:01.842 --> 00:01:04.486
P is equal to x times y,

00:01:04.486 --> 00:01:08.403
and Q is equal to y
squared minus x squared.

00:01:10.245 --> 00:01:11.111
And in the last video,

00:01:11.111 --> 00:01:13.285
I was talking about interpreting
the partial derivative

00:01:13.285 --> 00:01:15.045
of v, the vector-valued function

00:01:15.045 --> 00:01:17.202
with respect to one of the variables,

00:01:17.202 --> 00:01:18.734
which has its merits, and
I think it's a good way

00:01:18.734 --> 00:01:21.810
to understand vector-valued
functions in general.

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.800
But here that's not what I'm gonna do.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.871
It's actually, another useful skill

00:01:25.871 --> 00:01:28.852
is to just think in terms
of each specific component.

00:01:28.852 --> 00:01:30.249
So if we just think of P and Q,

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:33.166
we have four possible partial derivatives

00:01:33.166 --> 00:01:35.918
at our disposal here, two
of them with respect to P.

00:01:35.918 --> 00:01:38.053
So you can think about
the partial derivative

00:01:38.053 --> 00:01:40.199
of P with respect to x,

00:01:40.199 --> 00:01:43.809
or the partial derivative
of P with respect to y.

00:01:43.809 --> 00:01:45.040
And then similarly, Q,

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.508
you could think about
partial derivative of Q

00:01:47.508 --> 00:01:49.008
with respect to x.

00:01:50.621 --> 00:01:52.793
This should be a partial.

00:01:52.793 --> 00:01:55.029
Or the partial derivative of Q

00:01:55.029 --> 00:01:57.295
with respect to y.

00:01:57.295 --> 00:01:59.330
So four different values
that you could be looking at

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.613
and considering and
understanding how they influence

00:02:01.613 --> 00:02:03.857
the change of the vector field as a whole.

00:02:03.857 --> 00:02:05.075
And in this specific example,

00:02:05.075 --> 00:02:06.377
let's actually compute these.

00:02:06.377 --> 00:02:09.175
So derivative of P with respect to x.

00:02:09.175 --> 00:02:10.751
P is this first component.

00:02:10.751 --> 00:02:13.102
We're taking the partial
of this with respect to x.

00:02:13.102 --> 00:02:14.426
y looks like a constant.

00:02:14.426 --> 00:02:15.843
Constant times x.

00:02:17.036 --> 00:02:18.594
Derivative is just that constant.

00:02:18.594 --> 00:02:20.552
If we took the derivative
with respect to y,

00:02:20.552 --> 00:02:21.575
the roles have reversed,

00:02:21.575 --> 00:02:23.148
and its partial derivative is x,

00:02:23.148 --> 00:02:25.384
'cause x looks like that constant.

00:02:25.384 --> 00:02:26.989
But Q, its partial derivative

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:30.045
with respect to x, y
looks like a constant,

00:02:30.045 --> 00:02:33.566
negative x squared goes to negative 2x.

00:02:33.566 --> 00:02:35.551
But then when you're taking
it with respect to y,

00:02:35.551 --> 00:02:38.346
y squared now looks like a function

00:02:38.346 --> 00:02:39.819
whose derivative is 2y,

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:41.640
and negative x squared
looks like the constant.

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.771
So these are the four
possible partial derivatives.

00:02:44.771 --> 00:02:46.862
But let's actually see
if we can understand

00:02:46.862 --> 00:02:48.800
how they influence the
function as a whole.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.411
What it means in terms of the picture

00:02:50.411 --> 00:02:51.790
that we're looking at up here.

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.961
And, in particular,
let's focus on a point,

00:02:53.961 --> 00:02:55.501
a specific point,

00:02:55.501 --> 00:02:57.751
and let's do this one here.

00:02:59.886 --> 00:03:01.836
So it's something that's
sitting on the x-axis.

00:03:01.836 --> 00:03:03.533
So this is where y equals zero

00:03:03.533 --> 00:03:05.346
and x is something positive.

00:03:05.346 --> 00:03:09.734
So this is probably when x
is around two-ish, let's say.

00:03:09.734 --> 00:03:11.058
So the value we wanna look at

00:03:11.058 --> 00:03:11.891
is x, y

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:15.996
when x is two

00:03:15.996 --> 00:03:17.163
and y is zero.

00:03:19.565 --> 00:03:20.815
So if we start plugging that in here,

00:03:20.815 --> 00:03:24.205
what that would mean,
this guy goes to zero,

00:03:24.205 --> 00:03:26.232
this guy goes to two,

00:03:26.232 --> 00:03:28.311
this guy, negative two times x,

00:03:28.311 --> 00:03:29.972
is gonna be negative two.

00:03:29.972 --> 00:03:33.163
And then negative two
times y is gonna be zero.

00:03:33.163 --> 00:03:35.889
And let's start by just looking
at the partial derivative

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:38.057
of P with respect to x.

00:03:38.057 --> 00:03:40.557
So what that means is
that we're looking for

00:03:40.557 --> 00:03:42.974
how the x-component of
these vectors change

00:03:42.974 --> 00:03:46.463
as you move in the x direction.

00:03:46.463 --> 00:03:48.704
For example, around this
point, we're kind of thinking

00:03:48.704 --> 00:03:50.794
of moving in the x direction, vaguely.

00:03:50.794 --> 00:03:53.118
So we wanna look at the
two neighboring vectors

00:03:53.118 --> 00:03:56.882
and consider what's going
on with the x direction.

00:03:56.882 --> 00:03:59.189
But these vectors, this
one points purely down.

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:00.443
This one also points purely down,

00:04:00.443 --> 00:04:01.885
and so does this one.

00:04:01.885 --> 00:04:03.327
So no change is happening

00:04:03.327 --> 00:04:05.517
when it comes to the
x-component of these vectors,

00:04:05.517 --> 00:04:09.616
which makes sense because the
value at that point is zero.

00:04:09.616 --> 00:04:11.775
The partial derivative of P
with respect to x is zero,

00:04:11.775 --> 00:04:12.933
so we wouldn't expect a change.

00:04:12.933 --> 00:04:14.766
But on the other hand,

00:04:15.905 --> 00:04:17.580
on the other hand, if we're
looking at partial derivative

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:19.497
of P with respect to y,

00:04:20.344 --> 00:04:21.696
this should be positive.

00:04:21.696 --> 00:04:25.134
So this should suggest that
the change in the x-component

00:04:25.134 --> 00:04:28.717
as you move in the y
direction is positive.

00:04:29.571 --> 00:04:31.542
So we go up here and now we're not looking

00:04:31.542 --> 00:04:34.698
at change in the x-direction.

00:04:34.698 --> 00:04:38.588
Not looking at change in the x-direction.

00:04:38.588 --> 00:04:39.698
But instead we're wondering what happens

00:04:39.698 --> 00:04:41.752
as we move generally upwards.

00:04:41.752 --> 00:04:44.110
So we're gonna kind of
compare it to these two guys.

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:46.473
And in that case, the
x-component of this one

00:04:46.473 --> 00:04:48.165
is a little bit to the left.

00:04:48.165 --> 00:04:49.585
The one below it, it's a
little bit to the left.

00:04:49.585 --> 00:04:52.059
Then we get to our main
guy here and it's zero.

00:04:52.059 --> 00:04:53.865
The x-component is zero 'cause
it's pointing purely down.

00:04:53.865 --> 00:04:56.019
And up here it's pointing
a little bit to the right.

00:04:56.019 --> 00:04:57.519
So as y increases,

00:04:58.381 --> 00:05:01.695
the x-component of these
vectors also increases.

00:05:01.695 --> 00:05:03.526
And again, that makes sense

00:05:03.526 --> 00:05:06.366
because this partial
derivative is positive.

00:05:06.366 --> 00:05:08.725
This two suggests that
as you're changing y,

00:05:08.725 --> 00:05:12.362
the value of p, the
x-component of our function,

00:05:12.362 --> 00:05:13.944
should probably keep that on screen.

00:05:13.944 --> 00:05:16.147
You know, the x-component of
our vector-valued function

00:05:16.147 --> 00:05:18.802
is increasing 'cause that's positive.

00:05:18.802 --> 00:05:20.201
For contrast, let's say we look

00:05:20.201 --> 00:05:22.124
at the Q component over here.

00:05:22.124 --> 00:05:23.268
So what this is doing,

00:05:23.268 --> 00:05:24.454
we're looking at changes in the x,

00:05:24.454 --> 00:05:28.317
and we're wondering what the
y value of the vector does.

00:05:28.317 --> 00:05:30.190
So we go up here.

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:33.584
And now, we're not looking at
changes in the y direction.

00:05:33.584 --> 00:05:35.498
But instead, we're going
back to considering

00:05:35.498 --> 00:05:37.436
what happens as we change x,

00:05:37.436 --> 00:05:40.300
as we're kind of moving in
the horizontal direction here.

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:42.481
So again, we look at
these neighboring guys.

00:05:42.481 --> 00:05:46.227
And now, the y-component
starts off small, but negative,

00:05:46.227 --> 00:05:47.523
then gets a little bit more negative,

00:05:47.523 --> 00:05:49.141
then gets even more negative.

00:05:49.141 --> 00:05:50.708
And if we kind of keep looking at these,

00:05:50.708 --> 00:05:53.050
the y-component is getting more,
and more, and more negative

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:55.166
so it's decreasing.

00:05:55.166 --> 00:05:57.564
The value of Q, the
y-component of these vectors

00:05:57.564 --> 00:05:59.290
should be decreasing.

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:01.472
And that lines up 'cause
the partial derivative here

00:06:01.472 --> 00:06:03.248
was negative two, so that's telling us,

00:06:03.248 --> 00:06:05.927
given that it started negative,
it's getting more negative.

00:06:05.927 --> 00:06:07.288
If it started positive, they would've been

00:06:07.288 --> 00:06:09.212
kind of getting shorter as vectors

00:06:09.212 --> 00:06:11.473
as their y-component got smaller.

00:06:11.473 --> 00:06:13.679
And then finally, just to close things off

00:06:13.679 --> 00:06:16.560
nice and simply here, if
we look at partial of Q

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:18.060
with respect to y,

00:06:21.021 --> 00:06:23.865
so now if we start looking at
changes in the y direction,

00:06:23.865 --> 00:06:26.588
and we start considering
how, as you move below,

00:06:26.588 --> 00:06:28.081
and then starting to go up,

00:06:28.081 --> 00:06:29.491
what happens to the y-component,

00:06:29.491 --> 00:06:32.348
here, the y-component is a
little bit negative, right?

00:06:32.348 --> 00:06:33.607
It's pointing down and to the left.

00:06:33.607 --> 00:06:35.368
So down, it's a little bit negative.

00:06:35.368 --> 00:06:37.982
Here, the y-component is
also a little bit negative.

00:06:37.982 --> 00:06:40.433
Over here, well, it remains
a little bit negative.

00:06:40.433 --> 00:06:42.487
And you know, from our heuristic look,

00:06:42.487 --> 00:06:44.274
there's no discernible change.

00:06:44.274 --> 00:06:45.314
Maybe it's changing a little bit,

00:06:45.314 --> 00:06:47.343
and we don't have a fine
enough vision of these vectors

00:06:47.343 --> 00:06:49.441
to see that, but if we actually go back

00:06:49.441 --> 00:06:52.843
to the analysis, and see what we computed,

00:06:52.843 --> 00:06:54.027
in fact, it is zero.

00:06:54.027 --> 00:06:55.514
That fact that it looked like

00:06:55.514 --> 00:06:56.675
there was not too much change

00:06:56.675 --> 00:06:59.141
in the y-component of
each one of these vectors

00:06:59.141 --> 00:07:01.413
corresponds with the fact
that the partial derivative

00:07:01.413 --> 00:07:04.107
of that y-component with respect to y,

00:07:04.107 --> 00:07:07.774
with respect to vertical
movements, is zero.

00:07:09.345 --> 00:07:11.290
So this kind of analysis
should give a better feel

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:13.943
for how we understand the
four different possible

00:07:13.943 --> 00:07:15.859
partial derivatives and what they indicate

00:07:15.859 --> 00:07:18.159
about the vector field,
and you'll get plenty

00:07:18.159 --> 00:07:20.228
of chance to practice that understanding

00:07:20.228 --> 00:07:22.337
as we learn about divergence and curl,

00:07:22.337 --> 00:07:24.617
and try to understand
why each one of those

00:07:24.617 --> 00:07:26.415
represents the thing
that it's supposed to.

00:07:26.415 --> 00:07:30.440
And you'll see what I mean by
that in just a couple videos.
