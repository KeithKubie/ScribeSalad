00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.870
What animal do you spend the MOST time with?

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:08.040
I’ll give you a hint, it’s not your dog!

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.560
Because these guys live ON YOUR FACE.

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:20.179
Hey everyone, Laci Green here for DNews with
an update that makes my skin crawl.

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:23.279
Or things ON my skin crawl...really not sure
which.

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.260
We already know there’s all kinds of microscopic
things in and around and your body….and

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:28.289
everywhere, really.

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.990
Fungi and microbes and bacteria and viruses.

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.370
But a new study published in the journal PLOS
1 has now found that this long list of tiny

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.750
things includes….mites.

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.230
2 species of mites, to be specific: Demodex
folluculorum and Demodex brevis, which are

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.200
relatives of spiders and ticks.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:49.570
These little guys have made a cosy life living,
eating, sleeping, and having sex in your pores.

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.980
That’s right - sex may in fact be happening
on your face RIGHT NOW.

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:58.300
On the bright side, mites don’t release
any waste until they die, so their fecal facials

00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:59.780
are less common.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.890
Unlike past research which found mites on
about 10-20% of the population, this new method

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.840
of MITE EXPLORATION has found mites on 100%
of people.

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.440
In the past, scientists would peel off a piece
of tape from your face or scrape off some

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.580
of your sexy nose oil to search for the presence
of mites.

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.560
This method is flawed though, because they’re
in your pores - really hard to find - and

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.280
they’re also unevenly distributed.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.340
Maybe you have a colony living in your cheek,
but your mom has them in her chin.

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.780
The newer, more reliable method of mite exploration
involves similar sampling methods, but now

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.340
researchers are looking for mite DNA instead
of the mites themselves.

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.090
If you’re starting to feel itchy right about
now - just remember that the mites are fairly

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:38.090
harmless.

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:39.090
Well, in most people anyway.

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.760
They have been linked to instances of rosacea
and blepharitis (or inflammation along your

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.580
eyelashes), but that’s about it.

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:48.680
So how did this widespread infestation happen?

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.810
Scientists aren’t quite sure yet, but we
do have a few clues.

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.580
(1) The older you get, the more mites you
have.

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:58.680
(2) mites have been found on almost EVERY
animal we’ve tested them for except for…..Platypuses.

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:59.680
Random.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.420
(3) Some animals have more mite species than
we do, some have less.

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.110
And (4) the two species that occupy OUR pores
are not closely related.

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:09.789
Hmmmm….not closely related.

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:11.340
You know what that means?

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.239
They probably came from different places meaning
they’re probably coming from our environment

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:18.499
or perhaps other furry domesticated friends
of ours.

00:02:18.499 --> 00:02:22.500
It also means that these creatures have probably
been living on us for a long time, providing

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.999
us with POTENTIAL clues about paths of human
migration and our evolutionary history.

00:02:26.999 --> 00:02:29.779
All of that going on in my face and I didn’t
even know it.

00:02:29.779 --> 00:02:30.980
Thank you, science.

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.549
And thank YOU for joining me for DNews folks,
you can follow us on Twitter @DNews for more

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:35.290
