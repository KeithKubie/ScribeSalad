JOHN HOPE BRYANT &gt;&gt; Do global businesses have
a code of ethics, or should businesses have

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:13.769
a code of ethics? Really funny, I thought
they always did or always should have. We

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:21.160
have confused a prosperity agenda with a money
agenda. What we have been doing has been a

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:27.619
money agenda. That's why it ran into a wall.
That's why it didn't work. Ah-a money agenda

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:32.710
is no agenda at all.
Ah-America's not everything, it's not even

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:37.100
most things. But it is a great example of
some things. It's a great example of what

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:43.149
one CEO of this century called "America's
special sauce." And that special sauce is,

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:50.600
I believe, the power of the idea. Ah-what
do I mean by that. Um-Ted Turner, the founder

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.260
of CNN, he didn't wake up in the morning and
said I want to be rich and powerful. Steve

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:02.050
Jobs, the founder-or the de facto founder-of
Apple and the innovator for-ah-iTunes and

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:06.270
the iPhone and iPod-he didn't wake up in the
morning and said I want to be rich and I want

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.130
to be powerful. Um-you know-Klaus Schwab,
the founder of the world economic forum, didn't

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:15.120
wake up in the morning and said ah-I want
to be rich ah-and I want to be powerful. And

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.200
you can go on and on with these examples.
Ah-the point is Bill Gates did not wake up

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.160
in the morning and said I want to be rich,
I want to be powerful. They said, "I have

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:27.600
an idea." Ah-I've got this idea and I'm passionate
about this idea and it's going to empower

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.590
people.
So you can empower people with twenty-four-hour

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.810
news or you can empower people with a better
way of living or-ah-it's going to serve and

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:40.720
help people help themselves in some significant
way and it caught on as a positive epidemic.

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.180
THey worked it because they were passionate
about this idea and as a result of it becoming

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.640
successful they became immensely-ah-wealthy
and powerful.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:54.000
But you talk to these folks today, they're
still passionate about the idea. Klaus Schwab

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.380
thirty-five years after founding the water
_____ is passionate about the idea. We've

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.030
lost that. Yet, people who call themselves
entrepreneurs or call themselves CEOs who

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:09.979
took-takes a dollar bill or the rand or the
pound or whatever currency-the euro-and they

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:15.700
slice it up into pieces-ah-and call that entrepreneurship-that's
not entrepreneurship, that's not creating

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.700
value.
So should there be a business ethic? Um, of

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.340
course there should. If you don't have one,
you don't have a business. [LAUGH] Ah-you

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:30.829
have a slot machine-ah-but at some point-ah-that's
going to turn against you. So we really have

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:35.999
two choices. There's love and there's fear.
And what you don't love you fear. And the

00:02:35.999 --> 00:02:40.409
reason that the world is all screwed up is
that most leaders today lead by fear. And

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:47.639
fear's first cousin is greed. Greed's best
friend is laziness and short-termism. Ah-and

00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:53.180
all that feeds into this, "I want to get a
money agenda" that has slammed us into a global

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.409
economic wall.
So we need a hard reset. We need to get back

00:02:56.409 --> 00:03:00.150
to the power of the idea. We need to get back
to a long view. Ah-we need to figure out how

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:05.189
to do well and do good and make capitalism
and free enterprise actually relevant to the

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:10.099
poor. Make capitalism and free enterprise
actually work for the poor. We need to spread

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:15.340
a movement of not just civil rights but silver
rights because if you don't have a bank account,

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.640
an understanding of money and free enterprise
and financial literacy in the twenty-first

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.299
century and the global economy, you are an
economic slave.

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:26.599
So if you didn't have the right to vote in
the twentieth century, in a-in a century of

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:30.340
democracy, you were a slave. If you don't
have an understanding of free enterprise and

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:35.049
capitalism-ah-in the system and the ability
to access it in the twenty-first century,

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:39.700
you're still an economic slave.
So we need to empower people with a-use this

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:45.129
crisis-rainbows after storms-this is business
ethics now-of empowering people so that you

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:51.920
have-treat your clients like relationships
and not as transactions. Ah-if every banker

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:57.310
had lent money-ah-to their borrowers-it was
their grandmother, you would probably wouldn't

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:03.590
be in this mess that we're in today. A global
call for a massive uptake of financial literacy

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:11.049
education and empowerment around the world
will-will create stability, will restore consumer

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:17.680
confidence, will allow us to have a business
that is sustainable and will help empower

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.820
people to be their own best-ah-advocate and
protector for their family.

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:28.750
You heard it here-ah-YouTube, at Davos. And
it's cold here but it's warm-ah-in this building

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:32.090
with all this energy and passion about trying
to make the world a better place. Rainbows

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:32.950
after storms.
