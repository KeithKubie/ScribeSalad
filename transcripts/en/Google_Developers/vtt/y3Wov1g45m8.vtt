&gt;&gt; MATT GROSS: Hi, I’m Matt Gross and I
work at uLocate Communications, and I manage

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:16.049
the WHERE product line. So, WHERE is an application
that we built, it goes across platforms, and

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.370
we specifically built our Android version
as a native application. So to give you a

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:26.740
little bit of a background on that, we’ve
been building location-based services on mobile

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:32.570
phones for many years, and we could fairly
easily imported our existing J2ME version

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.030
over to Android. But as we really took a look
at it, at all the capabilities of the device

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.690
and the way that the UI worked, we decided
to start from scratch and essentially build

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.789
the new WHERE application from the ground
up. I have to say that we’re very happy

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:51.039
with having made that decision because the
app performs really well. We’ve been getting

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:57.610
great reviews and a lot of downloads. So,
the way we constructed that application is

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:03.109
essentially taking all of the various content
feeds that we have through partnerships and

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:09.510
also through our own user base, and assembled
those on the--on the server side, created

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:16.440
a set of JSON APIs that then get fed down
into the Android client itself. We use quite

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:21.930
a bit of native functionality in terms of
the native APIs. Chief among those would be

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.680
location because that’s really the core
of what we do in our name, WHERE, does represent

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:32.200
location. So, in terms of location management,
actually the Android platform makes things

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.560
extremely easy and that it provides that obstruction
layer so you don’t need to know everything

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:42.080
about GPS and all the ins and outs of the
system. But there’s still some important

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:48.820
tips for developers to keep in mind. I would
say that--one of those things is to not--to

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:55.680
query the device as rarely as you can possibly
get away with. And that’s just not GPS but

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:01.400
also cell ID location. What you don’t want
the user to do is have to wait as you’re

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:06.580
spending dial as the phone finds--tries to
find the location. So what we always do is

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.560
we prompt the user when they first enter into
the app. If they have a--if they were in the

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.670
app before, we’ll prompt them with the recently
used location. We’ll also prompt them if

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.950
they want to manually enter the address, and
that gives us a little bit of time that we

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.870
can do those network calls in the background
in a parallel process. And by the time the

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.670
user actually comes into the app and gets
to the home screen, ideally, we have a location

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:33.069
ready and waiting for them. We’ve also done
quite a bit of integration into Google Maps.

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:38.090
Another advantage to the Android platform
is that you have this beautiful ready made

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:44.069
mapping component that you can just plug right
in. That makes things a lot easier. We are--as

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:49.490
a location-focused company, we have built
many different mapping solutions where we

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:55.340
had to do it as a customized thing. And it’s
very nice for Android to have that capability

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:01.600
just all wrapped up. So we’re very excited
to have the launch of cupcake just rolling

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:07.300
out where even our users right now are telling
us that the T-Mobile users are getting the

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:12.209
upgrade down to their phone, and we’ve created
some special features for them. First of all,

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:16.960
we have a set of widgets. The first widget
is live and we’ve got a few others coming

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:21.910
down very shortly that we integrated into
Google Voice. So, it’s essentially you push

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:27.319
a button on the phone and prompts to enter
a search term, and then it takes you straight

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:31.840
into the WHERE application, picks up your
location, and we’ll do a search for that

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.100
term. It can go across different types of
content, so you can do it across Yellow Page

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:42.680
content or a Yelp preview using Yahoo as a
data source and ultimately you’ll be able

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:47.790
to search within any content source within
WHERE. We’ve also integrated live folders

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:54.160
so that if you are a user of the WHERE Wall,
which is our online forum and message board,

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:59.950
you can basically see that from one click
from your home screen. You tap on the icon

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:02.020
and you’ll see all the most recent wall
posts.
