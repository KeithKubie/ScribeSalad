00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Now, my question is how fast is this ball moving when it hits the ground.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
What is the final velocity?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
If I'm asking you about the final velocity, it means this is the fourth variable involved in the question.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
So, we have 1, 2, 3, 4 variables involved in this problem, and which four?

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Well, these four. Everything except for time.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
That looks like it corresponds to this equation, this tool.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
As every carpenter knows, having the right tool for the job makes this remarkably easy.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Now we can just plug in.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Can you use this new tool to plug in our known values and calculate V?

00:00:34.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Enter your answer in meters per second rounded to one decimal place.
