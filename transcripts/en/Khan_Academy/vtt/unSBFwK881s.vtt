00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.160
Let's graph ourselves
some inequalities.

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:06.050
So let's say I had the
inequality y is less than or

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:11.520
equal to 4x plus 3.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:15.500
On our xy coordinate plane, we
want to show all the x and y

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.650
points that satisfy this
condition right here.

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.210
So a good starting point might
be to break up this less than

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:24.570
or equal to, because we
know how to graph y is

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.140
equal to 4x plus 3.

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:31.510
So this thing is the same thing
as y could be less than

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:38.870
4x plus 3, or y could be
equal to 4x plus 3.

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.170
That's what less than
or equal means.

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.200
It could be less
than or equal.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.015
And the reason why I did that on
this first example problem

00:00:46.015 --> 00:00:47.730
is because we know how
to graph that.

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:48.980
So let's graph that.

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:55.170
Try to draw a little bit
neater than that.

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.800
So that is-- no, that's
not good.

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.460
So that is my vertical
axis, my y-axis.

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.920
This is my x-axis,
right there.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.920
And then we know the
y-intercept, the

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.580
y-intercept is 3.

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.510
So the point 0, 3-- 1, 2,
3-- is on the line.

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:18.405
And we know we have
a slope of 4.

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.430
Which means if we go 1 in the
x-direction, we're going to go

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:26.980
up 4 in the y.

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:29.280
So 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.920
So it's going to
be right here.

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.236
And that's enough
to draw a line.

00:01:33.236 --> 00:01:35.210
We could even go back
in the x-direction.

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.290
If we go 1 back in the
x-direction, we're

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.500
going to go down 4.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.930
1, 2, 3, 4.

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.480
So that's also going to be
a point on the line.

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:47.670
So my best attempt at drawing
this line is going to look

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.590
something like-- this
is the hardest part.

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.610
It's going to look something
like that.

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.270
That is a line.

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.470
It should be straight.

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.240
I think you get the idea.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.540
That right there is the graph
of y is equal to 4x plus 3.

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:07.440
So let's think about what it
means to be less than.

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.789
So all of these points
satisfy this

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:11.750
inequality, but we have more.

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.410
This is just these
points over here.

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.830
What about all these where
y ix less than 4x plus 3?

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.790
So let's think about
what this means.

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.410
Let's pick up some
values for x.

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.140
When x is equal to 0,
what does this say?

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.390
When x is equal to 0, then that
means y is going to be

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.150
less than 0 plus 3.
y is less than 3.

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:40.620
When x is equal to negative 1,
what is this telling us?

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.590
4 times negative 1 is negative
4, plus 3 is negative 1. y

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.840
would be less than negative 1.

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.950
When x is equal to 1, what
is this telling us?

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.110
4 times 1 is 4, plus 3 is 7.

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.340
So y is going to
be less than 7.

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.130
So let's at least try
to plot these.

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:04.670
So when x is equal to-- let's
plot this one first. When x is

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.805
equal to 0, y is less than 3.

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:15.230
So it's all of these points
here-- that I'm shading in in

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.310
green-- satisfy that
right there.

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.200
If I were to look at this one
over here, when x is negative

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.140
1, y is less than negative 1.

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.850
So y has to be all of these
points down here.

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:36.470
When x is equal to 1,
y is less than 7.

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.500
So it's all of these
points down here.

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:44.960
And in general, you take any
point x-- let's say you take

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:47.020
this point x right there.

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:50.980
If you evaluate 4x plus 3,
you're going to get the point

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.120
on the line.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.950
That is that x times 4 plus 3.

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.860
Now the y's that satisfy it,
it could be equal to that

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.100
point on the line, or it
could be less than.

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:03.840
So it's going to go
below the line.

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.870
So if you were to do this for
all the possible x's, you

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:11.130
would not only get all the
points on this line which

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:15.990
we've drawn, you would get all
the points below the line.

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:19.279
So now we have graphed
this inequality.

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:23.480
It's essentially this line, 4x
plus 3, with all of the area

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.490
below it shaded.

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:29.530
Now, if this was just a less
than, not less than or equal

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:32.670
sign, we would not include
the actual line.

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:36.090
And the convention to do that is
to actually make the line a

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:37.860
dashed line.

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:44.880
This is the situation if we were
dealing with just less

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.690
than 4x plus 3.

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:49.410
Because in that situation, this
wouldn't apply, and we

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:50.620
would just have that.

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:53.550
So the line itself wouldn't have
satisfied it, just the

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:55.010
area below it.

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:57.190
Let's do one like that.

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:06.230
So let's say we have y is
greater than negative x

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:09.530
over 2 minus 6.

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:11.940
So a good way to start-- the
way I like to start these

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:14.830
problems-- is to just graph
this equation right here.

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:18.780
So let me just graph-- just for
fun-- let me graph y is

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:24.200
equal to-- this is the same
thing as negative 1/2 minus 6.

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:30.890
So if we were to graph it, that
is my vertical axis, that

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:34.130
is my horizontal axis.

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:36.920
And our y-intercept
is negative 6.

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:40.170
So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:42.020
So that's my y-intercept.

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:43.960
And my slope is negative 1/2.

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:49.390
Oh, that should be an x there,
negative 1/2 x minus 6.

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:53.950
So my slope is negative 1/2,
which means when I go 2 to the

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:55.395
right, I go down 1.

00:05:55.395 --> 00:05:58.775
So if I go 2 to the right,
I'm going to go down 1.

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:05.870
If I go 2 to the left, if
I go negative 2, I'm

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:06.880
going to go up 1.

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.040
So negative 2, up 1.

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:11.530
So my line is going
to look like this.

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:15.200
My line is going to
look like that.

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:17.400
That's my best attempt
at drawing the line.

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.400
So that's the line
of y is equal to

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.080
negative 1/2 x minus 6.

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:24.730
Now, our inequality is not
greater than or equal, it's

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:28.320
just greater than negative x
over 2 minus 6, or greater

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:30.850
than negative 1/2 x minus 6.

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:35.230
So using the same logic as
before, for any x-- so if you

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:39.070
take any x, let's say that's
our particular x we want to

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:43.260
pick-- if you evaluate negative
x over 2 minus 6,

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:44.970
you're going to get that
point right there.

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:47.720
You're going to get the
point on the line.

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:50.620
But the y's that satisfy this
inequality are the y's

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:51.650
greater than that.

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:54.920
So it's going to be not that
point-- in fact, you draw an

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:58.930
open circle there-- because you
can't include the point of

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:00.750
negative 1/2 x minus 6.

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:02.750
But it's going to be all the
y's greater than that.

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:06.670
That'd be true for any x.

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:07.900
You take this x.

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:11.260
You evaluate negative 1/2 or
negative x over 2 minus 6,

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.660
you're going to get this
point over here.

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:19.100
The y's that satisfy it are
all the y's above that.

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:22.660
So all of the y's that satisfy
this equation, or all of the

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:25.990
coordinates that satisfy this
equation, is this entire area

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:28.310
above the line.

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:30.070
And we're not going to
include the line.

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:33.300
So the convention is to make
this line into a dashed line.

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:35.850
And let me draw-- I'm trying
my best to turn it into a

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:36.430
dashed line.

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:41.070
I'll just erase sections of
the line, and hopefully it

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:43.160
will look dashed to you.

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:45.590
So I'm turning that solid line
into a dashed line to show

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:48.500
that it's just a boundary, but
it's not included in the

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:51.210
coordinates that satisfy
our inequality.

00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:53.760
The coordinates that satisfy our
equality are all of this

00:07:53.760 --> 00:08:00.430
yellow stuff that I'm shading
above the line.

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:03.260
Anyway, hopefully you
found that helpful.
