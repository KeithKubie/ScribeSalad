00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:09.130
&gt;&gt; Sue Siegel: Good afternoon.

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:10.430
I'm Sue Siegel.

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:12.860
I'm the Director of Development
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.880
And this is a great
day for the Library.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.130
One we look forward
to the entire year.

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.700
We get to recognize and
celebrate the importance

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.790
of reading and authors and books.

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:27.850
Now we like to think that we make
it seem easy to do this every year.

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:31.450 position:56%
But the truth is that the National
Book Festival is a huge undertaking.

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:34.010
It's a huge financial undertaking.

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:35.310
And it's been made possible

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:37.920
by generous support
from our many sponsors.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.560
You can see who they are in your
programs, and on the video monitors

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.810
around the Convention Center.

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:45.440 position:56%
But we really can't take for granted

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.010
that this event will
continue to exist.

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.450
So I would ask you to consider
making a contribution right now

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:53.480
using your cell phone.

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.290
You can send a text to make a
one-time gift that will be added

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:57.850
to your mobile phone bill.

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:59.730
And the details should
be on the screen

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.290
and on the back of your program.

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:04.450
And now on to the main event.

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:06.400
It's my privilege to introduce one

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.270
of America's most generous
supporters

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.510
of the arts, history and culture.

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.610
A tireless champion of
reading and literacy.

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.610
And a man without whom there would
not be a National Book Festival.

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.170
Our lead benefactor and
Co-Chairman, David Rubenstein.

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.470
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Thank you.

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:25.050
[ Applause ]

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:26.350
So thank you.

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:31.170
So how many people
here have never been

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.550
to the National Book
Festival before?

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:33.850
Anybody? Oh, okay.

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.090
How many people been five times?

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.530
Ten times?

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.020
Okay. And how many people
like the price of admission?

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.250
Okay. Okay.

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.190
So we're very privileged
today to have one

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.560
of America's leading
scholars, certainly in the area

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.170
of national security and
defense, Graham Allison.

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:52.470
And let me introduce Graham.

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:53.930
And we're going to talk
about his latest book,

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:55.320
which I highly recommend.

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.550
I have finished reading
it not long ago.

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.000 position:56%
And we'll go through the book today.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.050
Graham is a graduate of
Harvard College, class of '62.

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:05.360
He won a Marshall Scholarship.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.490
And got a degree at Oxford,
came back to Harvard,

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:10.030
and got his Ph.D. at Harvard.

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.440
And started teaching
at Harvard in 1968.

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.800
So he's now been a
member of the faculty

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.860
at Harvard for about 50 years.

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.850
During that period of time he
was essentially the founding dean

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.990
of the Harvard Kennedy School,
and did that job for 12 years.

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:27.920
Subsequent to that he became
the head of the Belfer Center

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.070
for Science and International
Policy at Harvard,

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.960
and did that for 21 years,
now succeeded by Ash Carter,

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.030
former Secretary of Defense.

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.640
In addition to those
administrative roles,

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.970
Graham has been a leading
scholar on a number

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:44.380
of areas related to
national security.

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.480
One of them is the
Cuban Missile Crisis,

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.320
where he's written
probably the definitive book

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.060
on the Cuban Missile Crisis.

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.360
And he's written another book,

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.670 position:56%
which is now I think will be the
definitive book on our relationships

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:56.980 position:56%
between China and the United States.

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.450
And that's called "Destined
for War: Can America

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.190 position:56%
and China Escape Thucydides's Trap?"

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:04.810
Okay? You've got our attention.

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.270
What is Thucydides's trap?

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:08.570
&gt;&gt; Graham Allison: Okay.

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:12.540
So Thucydides's trap is the
dangerous dynamic that occurs

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.320
when a rising power threatens
to displace a ruling power.

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.920
Thucydides wrote about the rise
of Athens in classical Greece.

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.220
But you can think about the rise

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.710
of Germany the decades
right before World War I,

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:27.840
or the rise of China today.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.080
And when a rising power threatens
to displace a ruling power,

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.160
we should expect poop happens.

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.460
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Okay.

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:41.280
So for those who are not experts in
ancient Greek, who was Thucydides?

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.060
&gt;&gt; Graham Allison: Well,
that's a great question.

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.840
And Thucydides should be
part of the mental library

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.710
of every educated person.

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:54.670
I've been two months promoting
this book since it was published.

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:57.140
And I've learned that,
first, Americans don't

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:59.580
like multi-syllabic words.

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:03.460
And, secondly, that
Thucydides is a mouthful.

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:04.760
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:
What's the most [inaudible]--

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.560
&gt;&gt; Graham Allison: Let me just
make sure we've got it in unison.

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:08.990
One, two, three.

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:10.290
Thucydides.

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.000
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: What is
the most interesting pronunciation

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.300
you've heard?

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:17.660
&gt;&gt; Graham Allison: Well, if you
watch, we put up in conjunction

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.970
with the book a website, a
Thucydides's Trap website.

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:24.560
And you can Xi Jinping,
the President of China,

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.960
trying to say,"Th, th, th, th, th,"

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.150
because Chinese don't
pronounce Thucydides as--

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:33.450
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Okay.

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:35.370
&gt;&gt; Graham Allison: The way
that I mush up Mandarin words.

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.240
But, any case, Thucydides
was the founder of history.

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.020
He wrote the first
ever history book.

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:45.590 position:56%
So you can go download for free "The
History of the Peloponnesian War,"

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:49.130
and read the first 100 pages.

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:52.490
And if every page doesn't
make your heart go pitter-pat,

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:53.790
check your pulse.

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:55.090
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: All right.

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:56.390
Well, let's talk about this.

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:57.690
So what he did is he wrote a
book on the Peloponnesian War,

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:02.080
which was a war between Sparta,
which was the dominant power

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.280
in the Peloponnesians, and then
Athens, which was the rising power.

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.380
So under Thucydides's
trap, the trap being

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:14.070
that the rising power ultimately
might get the feeling it should

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:19.110
attack the larger power,
the more traditional power,

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:20.410
who attacked there?

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:21.930
Did Athens attack Sparta?

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:23.230
Is that what happened?

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:24.530
&gt;&gt; Graham Allison: Well,
that's a great question,

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:29.450
because Thucydides's main idea
was that you have this dynamic.

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:31.740
I'm the ruling power.

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:33.220
You're the rising power.

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:36.010
The rising power is
thinking, "I'm bigger.

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:37.310
I'm stronger.

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:38.610
I deserve more say.

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:40.020
I deserve more sway.

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:43.410
The current arrangements don't
take account of my interests."

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:46.120
And the ruling power thinks,
"This other [inaudible] is trying

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:50.300 position:56%
to upset the status quo that's
provided the environment that's been

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:52.640
good for everybody,
especially for you.

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:53.940
How did you grow up?"

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:57.510
So in that environment,
in some cases in the cases

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:00.570
that I've studied, a
rising power decides, "Well,

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:02.770
I'll fight the ruling
power," or the ruling power,

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:04.070
"I'll fight the rising power."

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:05.370
But that's not Thucydides's story.

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:10.660
Thucydides's story is that in
this dynamic both protagonists are

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:13.500
vulnerable to the action
of third parties.

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:17.140
So in Thucydides's story
you've got a rise of Athens,

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:22.480 position:56%
the fear in Sparta, and then
Corinth, which is an ally of Sparta,

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:24.370
gets into a tangle with Corcyra.

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:29.320
And they drag Athens and Sparta
into a war neither of them wanted.

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:30.620
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Okay.

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:31.920
But in the end Athens
attacked Sparta?

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:35.140
&gt;&gt; Graham Allison: Well,
again, it becomes complicated.

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:37.960
They get dragged in.

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:43.110
The Spartans began
violating the terms,--

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:44.410
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Okay.

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:45.710
&gt;&gt; Graham Allison: The
Athenians vote for war.

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:47.010
And then there's about six months

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:48.660
in which the war doesn't
actually happen,

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:50.970
where they could have
resolved the war even then.

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:52.270
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Okay.

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:53.570
All right.

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:54.870
So at Harvard, the Kennedy School,
you started something called

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:58.510
"Thucydides's Trap
Project," which said, "Okay.

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:02.270
If Athens and Sparta had this
problem, and they went to war,

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:05.140
let's see how many cases
in the ensuing 2,000 years

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:09.990
or so there were similar situations
where a rising power got trapped

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:13.400
into attacking a more
dominant power."

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:15.530
So how many instances were there?

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:18.580
&gt;&gt; Graham Allison: Well, so we've
only looked at the last 500 years.

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:19.880
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Okay.

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:21.420
&gt;&gt; Graham Allison: So just
the most recent 500 years,

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:24.450
starting with the end
of the 15th century--

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:25.750
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: All right.

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:27.050
&gt;&gt; Graham Allison:
Up until currently.

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:31.270
We found 16 cases, 1, 6, in
which a rising power threatens

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:33.050
to displace a ruling power.

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:35.380
Twelve of them ended in war.

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:37.150
Four of them in not war.

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:38.450
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Okay.

00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:41.370
So to avoid the Thucydides's
trap, you have to figure

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:45.540
out what the four did that avoided
the war, and what the twelve did

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:46.890
that didn't avoid the war.

00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:49.560
Okay. So let's go through
some examples through history.

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:53.270
So let's take an example
where a war was not avoided.

00:07:53.270 --> 00:08:00.390 position:56%
A rising power in the west was Japan
in the late 1930s and early 1940s.

00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:04.600 position:56%
The United States is the dominant
power in the Pacific to some extent.

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:06.520
So how did that come about?

00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:09.470
Did Japan feel the United States
didn't take them seriously enough?

00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:11.210
The United States didn't
know how to treat Japan?

00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:12.700
What happened there?

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:15.390
&gt;&gt; Graham Allison: Well,
it's a great question.

00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:16.690
And it's a long story.

00:08:16.690 --> 00:08:19.310
But I'll just try to do
the capsule in the book.

00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:23.520
In the appendix I give a little
capsule histories of each of these.

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:31.770
So basically about the turn of the
century, maybe just the beginning,

00:08:31.770 --> 00:08:36.070
Japan starts rising and
getting bigger and stronger.

00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:41.280
All of Asia has been
colonized by everybody else.

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:44.990
The U.S. establishes something
called an open-door policy

00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:48.020
in which it says everything's
going to stay the way things are.

00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:52.380
But the Japanese are feeling their
cut out of guaranteed resources

00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:54.710
as their economy gets
bigger and stronger.

00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:57.120 position:56%
So they begin to be more aggressive.

00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:59.770
They act against China.

00:08:59.770 --> 00:09:01.740
They are aggressive
against Indonesia.

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:04.580
The U.S. says to them,
"Absolutely not.

00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:07.840
Stop." But first we do
a trade war with them.

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:11.300
Then we do an embargo
on their shipments.

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:14.050
Then we do an oil embargo.

00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:17.230
And not realizing and
not understanding

00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:19.630
that from the Japanese
point of view this looked

00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:21.640 position:56%
like we were simply strangling them.

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:23.440
And we were to the point of where

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:26.680
in the Japanese calculation
they could either be strangled

00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:30.480
by the U.S. immediately,
or they could take a chance

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:33.730
on attacking the U.S. at
Pearl Harbor, as they did.

00:09:33.730 --> 00:09:35.030
And, so, they chose to attack.

00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:36.330
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Okay.

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:37.630
So that's what happened there.

00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:38.930
The Thucydides's trap
could not be avoided.

00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:40.230
Let's take another example.

00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:42.760
In the early part of the
20th century in Europe,

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:44.900
Germany was a rising power.

00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:47.500
And while we know Germany
is a powerful country then,

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:49.110
it was really coming
together as a country,

00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:52.490
because it was being put together,
the dominant power was England.

00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:55.090
So how did Germany look at England?

00:09:55.090 --> 00:09:58.610
And how did they not avoid that
the Thucydides's trap there?

00:09:58.610 --> 00:09:59.910
&gt;&gt; Graham Allison: Well, again,

00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:03.110
I have a chapter on
"The Road to 1914."

00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:08.260
And I would say this is the
most eerie in similarity

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.830
to what we're seeing
in the rise of China.

00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:16.360
So Germany got unified as
a country in the 1870s.

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:17.660
They then began to grow.

00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:20.510
They were about half the
size of the GDP of Britain

00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:22.190
at the time they unified.

00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:23.960
By 1900 they were equal.

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:26.520
By 1914 they were recorded larger.

00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:29.230
So they were on a tear.

00:10:29.230 --> 00:10:32.200
From the point of view of Britain,
which had been the ruling power

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:34.020
for 100 years, this is the time

00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:37.020
when it was said the sun never
set on the British Empire.

00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:40.290
So they had Canada and
India and South Africa.

00:10:40.290 --> 00:10:43.100
They had the Navy that
ruled the waves completely.

00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:46.930
So the idea that here's this
Germany, which is now unified,

00:10:46.930 --> 00:10:50.230
that's building up its strength,
building up its military strength,

00:10:50.230 --> 00:10:57.350
building up its Navy, impacted
Britain so severely that they began

00:10:57.350 --> 00:11:00.200
to become entangled
with third parties.

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:02.520
So Britain became entangled
with France.

00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:05.440
France had an alliance with Russia.

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:09.930
This created a set of
interlocking commitments such that

00:11:09.930 --> 00:11:13.600
when a third-party action,
which was completely bizarre,

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:17.650
[inaudible] the Archduke, who
was the successor to the throne

00:11:17.650 --> 00:11:22.990
in Vienna, was assassinated in
Sarajevo by a Serbian terrorist.

00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:25.670
So it would have been an
inconsequential event normally.

00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:29.170
But that end up to serve as
a trigger to a set of actions

00:11:29.170 --> 00:11:32.790
and reactions, by the end of
which all the parties were at war.

00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:34.090
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: All right.

00:11:34.090 --> 00:11:36.110
So in the case of World
War II and World War I,

00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:38.600
the Thucydides's trap
was not avoided.

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:41.180
Let's take a case where
it was avoided.

00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:46.030
In the lifetime of many people
here it was thought, by some of us,

00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:47.520
that maybe the United States

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:50.710
and the then Soviet Union
could not avoid war.

00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:53.380
We were the two dominant
post-World War II powers.

00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:56.370
But we actually ended the
Cold War without any Hot War.

00:11:56.370 --> 00:11:59.120
How did we actually
avoid the Hot War?

00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:02.080 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Graham Allison: Well, again, this
is one of the most amazing stories.

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:06.440
And I think Americans, especially
most of us lived through portions

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:08.620
of it, haven't really appreciated.

00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:13.630
So first off, in the period right
after World War II, as you said,

00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:17.900
we're left standing basically, the
U.S. in particular, with about half

00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:22.570 position:56%
of the world's GDP, and the Soviet
Union, which had actually done a lot

00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:25.690
of the heavy lifting, in
the defeat of the Nazis.

00:12:25.690 --> 00:12:28.700
So then things stumble
around for a while.

00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:34.190
But by the 1950s, or by 1961
when John Kennedy comes to town

00:12:34.190 --> 00:12:38.720 position:56%
as president, the well-known fact
is that the Soviet Union is surging,

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:42.490
and is actually going to
overtake the U.S. in terms of GDP.

00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:46.860
I show in the book a quote
from the economic textbook

00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:48.320
of the time, Paul Sanderson,--

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:49.620
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:
Paul Sanderson.

00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:50.920
&gt;&gt; Graham Allison: He predicts
that by the end of the '70s,

00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:55.720
this is in his 1964 textbook, the
Soviet Union will overtake the U.S.

00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:59.700
So the fear in terms of the
impact of the Soviet Union,

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:03.600
the missile gap, all the
things that surrounded that,

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:10.470
in that context the people we
celebrate still as the wise men,

00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:14.980
people like George Kennan, who
wrote back the famous telegram,

00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:18.520
or Acheson, or Vandenberg,
the Republican leader

00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:22.330
of the Foreign Relations
Committee, or Truman in particular,

00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:26.090
or Marshall, created
in a great surge

00:13:26.090 --> 00:13:30.780
of imagination a strategy they
called "The Cold War Strategy."

00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:33.800
And Cold War was competition
on every dimension,

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:36.390
and by all means except one--

00:13:36.390 --> 00:13:39.220
no bombs and bullets
killing each other directly.

00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:43.420
So you had this extreme
competition in every dimension--

00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:49.700
economic, political, ideological,
covert action, even proxy wars,

00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:51.740
but not you and me
killing each other.

00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:55.430
And that came to some
very close calls,

00:13:55.430 --> 00:13:57.280 position:56%
as you and I've talked often before.

00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:00.610
The Cuban Missile Crisis was
about, as Kennedy thought,

00:14:00.610 --> 00:14:03.700
about a one in three chance that
would have ended in a nuclear war.

00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:05.000
Well, it didn't.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.920
They began to develop some
constraints on the competition.

00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:12.020
And lo and behold it ended with
a whimper, rather than a bang.

00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:13.320
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: All right.

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:14.680
So the Cold War ended.

00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:17.420
And we didn't really
have a Hot War there.

00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:20.480
So the Thucydides's trap
was avoided in that case.

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:21.780
&gt;&gt; Graham Allison: Right.

00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:23.080
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Let's
go forward to China now.

00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:25.280
Let's talk about China
and put it in context.

00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:28.500
For most of organized history
China was the biggest economy

00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:29.800
in the world.

00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:31.100
Is that right?

00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:32.400
&gt;&gt; Graham Allison: Mainly because
it just had the most people.

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:35.110
So everybody was poor, but
there was more of them in China,

00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:37.250
so it was the largest
national economy.

00:14:37.250 --> 00:14:38.550
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Okay.

00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:40.630
And then around the 1700s
or so Europe came along,

00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:42.600
and Europe became a
more dominant economy.

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:43.900
And then China went--

00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:45.200
&gt;&gt; Graham Allison:

00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:46.500
And the Industrial
Revolution and technology.

00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:49.500
And all of a sudden a
spurt in growth there.

00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:50.800
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:
But China, therefore,

00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:54.000
goes into relative oblivion
compared to where they had been.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.020
In the 14 or 1500s maybe they
were the dominant economy

00:14:57.020 --> 00:14:58.920
in the world, or at
least the largest.

00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:00.290
Europe comes along.

00:15:00.290 --> 00:15:04.350
And then ultimately China
has its revolutions.

00:15:04.350 --> 00:15:07.990
And then in 1949 Mao Zedong
defeats Chiang Kai-shek.

00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:13.750
And China goes kind of dark in
terms of the rest of the world.

00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:16.300 position:56%
Richard Nixon goes to China in 1972.

00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:19.380
At that time what was the
size of the Chinese economy?

00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:20.950
&gt;&gt; Graham Allison: Five
percent of the U.S. then.

00:15:20.950 --> 00:15:22.460
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:
Five percent.

00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:26.420
Okay. And as a result of
Richard Nixon going to China,

00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:29.700
and as a result of some leadership
changes, Deng Xiaoping came

00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:31.500
in ultimately after Mao Zedong,

00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:33.760
China decides to open
up to the west.

00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:38.950
So over the last, let's say, 30, 40
years or so, China has been opening

00:15:38.950 --> 00:15:40.570
up and growing its economy.

00:15:40.570 --> 00:15:44.440 position:56%
Where does China's economy stand
today relative to the United States?

00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:45.740
&gt;&gt; Graham Allison: Well, again,

00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:47.790
in Washington most
people won't know this,

00:15:47.790 --> 00:15:49.820
as most Americans don't know this.

00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:55.420
But China's economy today is
larger than the economy of the U.S.

00:15:55.420 --> 00:16:00.560
That was the big takeaway from the
2014 IMF World Bank meeting here

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:01.860
in Washington.

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:06.060
And if you go to the CIA's website,
or you go to the IMF website,

00:16:06.060 --> 00:16:10.380
and measure economies like what
those [inaudible] each of them,

00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:13.070
both agree is the single
best measure,--

00:16:13.070 --> 00:16:14.370
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Right.

00:16:14.370 --> 00:16:15.670
&gt;&gt; Graham Allison: Which
is purchasing power parity,

00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:19.190
China's economy is now about
10% larger than the U.S.

00:16:19.190 --> 00:16:22.090
So I illustrate this in
the book with a seesaw.

00:16:22.090 --> 00:16:26.120
So if you imagine a seesaw
on a kids' playground,

00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:29.860
with the U.S. sitting on one end
and China sitting on the other.

00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:35.950 position:56%
In 1980, when Reagan became
president, China was 10% of the U.S.

00:16:35.950 --> 00:16:40.550
By 2014 equal to the U.S. And
on the current trajectories

00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:43.760
by 2024 will be 40% larger.

00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:47.160
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Now, for
those who may not be economists,

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:49.780
we measure in the United
States typically our economy

00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:54.560
by something called "GDP,
Gross Domestic Product."

00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:57.290
It used to be called
"GNP," but now GDP.

00:16:57.290 --> 00:17:01.250 position:56%
However, there's another measure
called "Purchase Price Parity," PPP,

00:17:01.250 --> 00:17:04.770
and that really means the value
of the goods and services produced

00:17:04.770 --> 00:17:07.000
in terms of the context
of the economy,

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.470
and what you can buy for it.

00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:11.010
And by that measure, not by GDP,

00:17:11.010 --> 00:17:14.640
but by Purchase Price
Parity, China is bigger today.

00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:15.940
&gt;&gt; Graham Allison: Right.

00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:17.240
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Okay.

00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:18.540 position:56%
But even by GDP China is not that
much smaller than the United States.

00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:19.840
&gt;&gt; Graham Allison: Correct.

00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:21.140
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:
Is that correct?

00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:22.440
&gt;&gt; Graham Allison: Correct.

00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:23.740
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Okay.

00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:25.040
What about the military of China?

00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:26.340
The United States has the largest
military budget in the world,

00:17:26.340 --> 00:17:27.640
roughly 600 plus billion
dollars or so.

00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:33.540
We spend the largest percentage
of our GDP on military probably

00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:35.980
than any other country, or
at least the largest amount.

00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:37.930
Where does China stand?

00:17:37.930 --> 00:17:41.690
&gt;&gt; Graham Allison: Well, the
U.S. has invested in military

00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:45.540
at multiples of China
for now decades.

00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:49.570
So the U.S. stays substantially
ahead for the time being.

00:17:49.570 --> 00:17:52.760
But China's growth
has been double-digit

00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:55.280
for now almost 15 years.

00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:58.160
And, so, in the regional
competition--

00:17:58.160 --> 00:17:59.460
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Right.

00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:00.940
&gt;&gt; Graham Allison: If you look at
the balance of power, for example,

00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:04.680
in the East China Sea
or the South China Sea

00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:08.610
or in the Korean Peninsula,
China has become stronger

00:18:08.610 --> 00:18:10.280
and stronger relative to the U.S.

00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:11.580
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Okay.

00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:12.880
Now does China have nuclear power?

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:14.180
&gt;&gt; Graham Allison: Yes.

00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:15.480
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:
They have nuclear weapons.

00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:16.780
&gt;&gt; Graham Allison: The Chinese
not only have nuclear weapons,

00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:19.430
but they have what would be called
"a superpower nuclear arsenal."

00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:21.850
That is they have so
many nuclear weapons,

00:18:21.850 --> 00:18:26.590 position:56%
and so reliable nuclear weapons,
that even if the U.S. attacked them,

00:18:26.590 --> 00:18:30.630
we can't disarm them such that they
wouldn't be able to destroy us.

00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:35.060
So they have the mutual assured
destruction condition that we ended

00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:38.270
up with the Soviet Union, or we
continue to have with Russia today.

00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:39.570
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Okay.

00:18:39.570 --> 00:18:41.350
Now does China say, "Well, United
States, you're a great country.

00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:43.000
You have a nice democracy.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.910
We admire your Jeffersonian
principles.

00:18:45.910 --> 00:18:49.390
Therefore, we don't really want
to challenge you politically,

00:18:49.390 --> 00:18:50.690
militarily or economically."

00:18:50.690 --> 00:18:52.220
Do the Chinese leadership
say that or?

00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:53.520
&gt;&gt; Graham Allison: Well, not quite.

00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:54.820
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Okay.

00:18:54.820 --> 00:18:58.060
&gt;&gt; Graham Allison: In the
book I quote Lee Kuan Yew,

00:18:58.060 --> 00:19:03.760
who was the founder of Singapore
and the guy that built Singapore.

00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:06.610
And he was also the world's
premier China watcher,

00:19:06.610 --> 00:19:08.620
until he died in 2015.

00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:12.680
So I put to him the question,
"Are the Chinese current leaders,

00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:17.080
including Si, serious
about displacing the U.S.

00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:21.140
as the predominant power in
Asia in the foreseeable future?"

00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:25.340 position:56%
Now if you ask any China expert that
they'll say, "Oh, it's complicated

00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:26.850
on the one hand, on
the other hand-- ."

00:19:26.850 --> 00:19:28.430
They won't really give
you an answer.

00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:31.070
Lee Kuan Yew answers,
"Yes, of course.

00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:32.660
Who could imagine otherwise?

00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:35.590
How could they not aspire
to be number one in Asia,

00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:37.230
and maybe in time in the world?"

00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:42.640
So China's aspiration is that
it'll become the predominant power

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:44.100
in its neighborhood.

00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:46.510
And its neighborhood is
everything it can see.

00:19:46.510 --> 00:19:47.810
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Okay.

00:19:47.810 --> 00:19:49.630
So the current leader, as
you mentioned, of China,

00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:52.320
and the title is President,
as well as I guess the leader

00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:54.510
of the Communist Party,
is Xi Jinping.

00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:55.810
&gt;&gt; Graham Allison: Yes.

00:19:55.810 --> 00:19:57.960
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:
Is Xi Jinping different

00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:01.810
than his predecessor, Hu Jintao,
or Jiang Zemin, his predecessor,

00:20:01.810 --> 00:20:05.040
or is he roughly in the same mold?

00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:06.360
&gt;&gt; Graham Allison: A
very different mold.

00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:11.940
I would say Xi Jinping is
the most impressive leader

00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:15.660
on the international stage today.

00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:17.690
Extremely.

00:20:17.690 --> 00:20:24.100
He, first, has taken over what
was a collective leadership,

00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:27.000
and what the whole system,
the whole political system,

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.070
had tried to establish as
a collective leadership,

00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:32.630
because they feared
one-man leadership,

00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:35.280
because they remembered
Mao and the craziness

00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:36.700
of the Cultural Revolution.

00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:40.070
In two years he had basically
overturned that regime.

00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:45.680
So now he's often referred to as
the COE, the Chief of Everything.

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:46.980
So he's in--

00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:48.280
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Okay.

00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:49.580
&gt;&gt; Graham Allison:
Charge of the whole thing.

00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:50.880
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Now--

00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:52.180
&gt;&gt; Graham Allison: And next month,
in October or the month after next,

00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:55.020 position:56%
he's going to have a party Congress,
at which they're going to anoint him

00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:56.950 position:56%
for another five years as president.

00:20:56.950 --> 00:20:59.430
But probably in such
a way that it looks

00:20:59.430 --> 00:21:01.280
like he could stay even longer.

00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:02.910
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Now for
those who don't follow this,

00:21:02.910 --> 00:21:05.530
the Chinese have been
governed over the recent years

00:21:05.530 --> 00:21:07.400
by a politburo of nine people.

00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:09.000
But now he's reduced it to seven.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:10.300
&gt;&gt; Graham Allison: Right.

00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:11.850 position:56%
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: But, more to
the point, there's been a tradition,

00:21:11.850 --> 00:21:13.150
it just says the United States,

00:21:13.150 --> 00:21:17.050
you can get to elect a president
twice, serve eight years.

00:21:17.050 --> 00:21:19.860
In China the tradition has
been you can be president two

00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:21.160
five-year terms.

00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:22.460
&gt;&gt; Graham Allison: Right.

00:21:22.460 --> 00:21:23.760
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: And
what you're saying is you think

00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:26.260
that Xi Jinping might say, "After
my second five-year term I might

00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:27.620
like a third or fourth
five-year term."

00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:29.510
&gt;&gt; Graham Allison: I may need
to stay longer, because I've got

00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:31.260
such an ambitious agenda.

00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:32.560
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Okay.

00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:33.860
&gt;&gt; Graham Allison: And
what is his agenda?

00:21:33.860 --> 00:21:37.800
Long before Donald Trump had "Make
America great again," Xi Jinping,

00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:42.020
in 2012 when he became president,
colloquially his line was

00:21:42.020 --> 00:21:43.670
"Make China great again."

00:21:43.670 --> 00:21:47.930
It's called the great rejuvenation
of the great Chinese people.

00:21:47.930 --> 00:21:52.470
And in the Chinese view we were
great until westerners showed up.

00:21:52.470 --> 00:21:53.770
Just what you were saying.

00:21:53.770 --> 00:21:57.130
They showed up a couple hundred
years ago and exploited us.

00:21:57.130 --> 00:22:01.430 position:56%
And they engaged in imperialism, and
fought a war called "The Opium War"

00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:05.180
in order to make legal we
could sell opium to them.

00:22:05.180 --> 00:22:09.070
Okay? So that period
is over for Xi Jinping.

00:22:09.070 --> 00:22:10.780
We're now big and strong enough.

00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:12.080
Butt out [inaudible].

00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:13.570
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: So, let's
see, in terms of the population,

00:22:13.570 --> 00:22:16.420
the United States' population
is roughly 330 million?

00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:17.720
&gt;&gt; Graham Allison: Yep.

00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:19.020
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: The
population of China is what?

00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:20.320
&gt;&gt; Graham Allison: 1.4.

00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:21.620
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:
Now that's 1.4,

00:22:21.620 --> 00:22:23.350
though they had a one-child
policy for a long time.

00:22:23.350 --> 00:22:25.710
Now they have essentially
abandoned the one-child policy.

00:22:25.710 --> 00:22:29.140 position:56%
Do you think that China's population
will grow exponentially now or not?

00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:30.440
&gt;&gt; Graham Allison:
Not exponentially.

00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:32.260
But it'll start creeping up, yes.

00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:33.560
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Right.

00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:35.800
Who is the biggest producer of
semi-conductors in the world?

00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:37.100
&gt;&gt; Graham Allison: China.

00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:38.400
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Who's
the biggest producer of steel?

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:39.700
&gt;&gt; Graham Allison: China.

00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:41.980
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:
Biggest producer of cell phones?

00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:43.280
&gt;&gt; Graham Allison: China.

00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:45.340
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Biggest
producer of television sets?

00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:46.640
&gt;&gt; Graham Allison: China.

00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:49.090
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Who's
the biggest producer of,

00:22:49.090 --> 00:22:50.740
I don't know, athletic equipment?

00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:52.040
China.

00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:53.340
&gt;&gt; Graham Allison: Everything.

00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:54.640
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Everything.

00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:55.940
Okay. So in China--

00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:57.240
&gt;&gt; Graham Allison: Who has
the biggest middle class?

00:22:57.240 --> 00:22:58.540
China. Who has the
most billionaires?

00:22:58.540 --> 00:23:00.290
China. Who has the
fastest supercomputer?

00:23:00.290 --> 00:23:01.590
China.

00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:02.890
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Okay.

00:23:02.890 --> 00:23:05.260
So having all these things,
does China say, "Well,

00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:07.680
we're happy to be a little bit
subordinate to the United States

00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:10.920 position:56%
on the world scene, because the
United States you put the World Bank

00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:13.820
together, you put the IMF
together, you put the UN together.

00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:15.120
You deserve a lot of credit

00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:16.480
for all those things you
did after World War II.

00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:19.060
So we wouldn't mind being a little
subordinate to the United States."

00:23:19.060 --> 00:23:20.860
So does Chinese leadership
say that now?

00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:23.900
&gt;&gt; Graham Allison:
Well, again, not quite.

00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:30.460
I should say initially their
ambition is in their region.

00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:34.300
So they would like to be the
predominant power in Western Asia.

00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:38.540
When they look out and see the
American Navy as the arbiter

00:23:38.540 --> 00:23:42.220
in the South China Sea,
they think that's anomalous.

00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:43.520
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Okay.

00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:44.820
&gt;&gt; Graham Allison: I even
have a section in the book

00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:48.310
that goes, "China sees China seas."

00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:52.130
So basically a PLA Navy guy said
to me, "Look at your own map.

00:23:52.130 --> 00:23:54.770
What is the name of
this body of water?

00:23:54.770 --> 00:23:56.340
It's called the South China Sea.

00:23:56.340 --> 00:23:57.940
It's not called the U.S. Sea.

00:23:57.940 --> 00:24:01.340
Why then is the U.S. Navy
the dominant power there?"

00:24:01.340 --> 00:24:02.720
And I say, "Wait a minute.

00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:04.450
There was the Battle of Midway.

00:24:04.450 --> 00:24:08.340
For seventy years we created
an economic and political order

00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:11.550
and security order that's
been fantastic for you.

00:24:11.550 --> 00:24:13.120
You should be grateful for that."

00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:16.020
And they would say, "Well, okay, we
can accept that you did something.

00:24:16.020 --> 00:24:17.320
But that's enough now.

00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:18.620
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Right.

00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:19.920
&gt;&gt; Graham Allison: We'll
take care of that."

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:21.220
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:
But you pointed

00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:22.520 position:56%
out in your book very tellingly
that the United States has a mindset

00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:23.820
of kind of instant gratification.

00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:25.280
We like things pretty quickly.

00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:29.240
And for us a long-time horizon
might be a year or two or three.

00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:31.990
The Chinese have a horizon
of, let's say, millennium.

00:24:31.990 --> 00:24:34.950
I mean they will look at
100 years or even more.

00:24:34.950 --> 00:24:36.250
&gt;&gt; Graham Allison: Right.

00:24:36.250 --> 00:24:38.450
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: So if China
has this long-term view why don't

00:24:38.450 --> 00:24:40.880
they just not, why do we
have to worry about them,

00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:43.980
because in a long-term they might
think they'll prevail, then, well,

00:24:43.980 --> 00:24:45.310
the United States might fade.

00:24:45.310 --> 00:24:48.090
So why do we have to worry about
any military confrontation,

00:24:48.090 --> 00:24:49.840
because the Chinese
can just wait us out?

00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:51.140
Is that not right?

00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:52.440
&gt;&gt; Graham Allison: I think
that's a good question.

00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:54.770
And I'm sure they think
a lot about that.

00:24:54.770 --> 00:24:57.600
And I think that, in terms
of your previous question

00:24:57.600 --> 00:24:59.260
about global leadership,

00:24:59.260 --> 00:25:01.970
I don't think the Chinese
have much aspiration

00:25:01.970 --> 00:25:04.430 position:56%
for global leadership at the moment.

00:25:04.430 --> 00:25:06.860
They're interested
in their regional,

00:25:06.860 --> 00:25:09.290
they're just [inaudible]
first the well-being of China,

00:25:09.290 --> 00:25:10.940
and second their neighborhood.

00:25:10.940 --> 00:25:16.070
But in their neighborhood they find
the U.S. has the predominant power.

00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:19.590
So the U.S. is the dominant
power in the South China Sea.

00:25:19.590 --> 00:25:22.240
The U.S. is the dominant
power in the East China Sea.

00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:25.020
The U.S. does have a military ally

00:25:25.020 --> 00:25:27.310
in South Korea right
on their border.

00:25:27.310 --> 00:25:31.120
The U.S. has a military ally
in Japan right around them.

00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:34.100
So it's those pieces that
they'll push up against first.

00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:35.400
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Okay.

00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:39.870 position:56%
So in the Obama administration there
was talk about a pivot to Asia,

00:25:39.870 --> 00:25:42.400
implying that we were not going
to focus on Europe so much,

00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:44.860
maybe not the Middle East so much,
we're going to pivot to Asia.

00:25:44.860 --> 00:25:47.350
Were the Chinese happy that we're
paying more attention to them now,

00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:49.550
or to Asia, or they weren't?

00:25:49.550 --> 00:25:50.850
&gt;&gt; Graham Allison: No.

00:25:50.850 --> 00:25:54.130
Between malign the tension
they preferred benign neglect.

00:25:54.130 --> 00:25:55.430
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Okay.

00:25:55.430 --> 00:25:56.730
So they weren't happy about that.

00:25:56.730 --> 00:25:58.030
&gt;&gt; Graham Allison: They
were not too happy.

00:25:58.030 --> 00:25:59.330
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Okay.

00:25:59.330 --> 00:26:00.630
So in your book you point out
there are four potential areas

00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:02.770
of confrontation between
the United States and China.

00:26:02.770 --> 00:26:04.070
There could be more.

00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:05.370
But you site four.

00:26:05.370 --> 00:26:06.670
Let's just go through those four.

00:26:06.670 --> 00:26:07.970
One is North Korea.

00:26:07.970 --> 00:26:11.480
We have this conflict and it's
been going on for a long time

00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:13.580
with South Korea and North Korea.

00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:15.950
Your view is so possibly
something happened in North Korea

00:26:15.950 --> 00:26:18.870
that might put a confrontation
between us and China.

00:26:18.870 --> 00:26:20.610
Could you explain that?

00:26:20.610 --> 00:26:25.040
&gt;&gt; Graham Allison: Again, it's
almost impossible to believe,

00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:29.410
but I think if you look at the
facts North Korea, Kim Jong-un,

00:26:29.410 --> 00:26:35.030
could drag China and the U.S. into
a war that nobody in China wants,

00:26:35.030 --> 00:26:37.010
and nobody in the U.S. wants.

00:26:37.010 --> 00:26:40.270
I was in Beijing just a month ago
talking about Thucydides's trap

00:26:40.270 --> 00:26:42.680
with a group of PLA Colonels.

00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:46.080
And a young man said, "You
know, no, it's impossible

00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:49.810
that North Korea could
drag us into a war."

00:26:49.810 --> 00:26:52.390
And I said, "Well, does
anybody think has this ever

00:26:52.390 --> 00:26:54.060
happened before?"

00:26:54.060 --> 00:26:55.610
And one of his colleagues
said, "Wait a minute.

00:26:55.610 --> 00:26:57.330
What happened in 1950?"

00:26:57.330 --> 00:27:01.970
In 1950 North Korea
attacked South Korea.

00:27:01.970 --> 00:27:03.960
South Korea almost
captured the whole country.

00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:06.510
The U.S. came to the
rescue at the last-minute,

00:27:06.510 --> 00:27:10.230 position:56%
pushed North Koreans back up the
peninsula, across the 38th parallel,

00:27:10.230 --> 00:27:14.310
where the war started, towards the
Chinese border, the Yalu River.

00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:16.830
Out of the blue came the
Chinese into the war.

00:27:16.830 --> 00:27:18.750
This is only one year, as you said.

00:27:18.750 --> 00:27:21.830
Only 49, Mao had just
barely won the Civil War.

00:27:21.830 --> 00:27:25.920
Just one year after that their
economy's about a 50th their size.

00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:27.400
So it hardly matters.

00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:29.460
They attacked us and
beat us right back

00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:32.240
down the peninsula
to the 38th parallel.

00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:35.280
In that war 50,000 Americans died,

00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:37.530
several hundred thousand
Chinese died,

00:27:37.530 --> 00:27:40.310
and even millions of
South Koreans died.

00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:41.860
That was not a war Mao wanted.

00:27:41.860 --> 00:27:44.020
It was not a war the U.S. wanted.

00:27:44.020 --> 00:27:46.490
But one thing happened
that knocked on the other

00:27:46.490 --> 00:27:47.790
that knocked on the other.

00:27:47.790 --> 00:27:49.350
So that's the Thucydidian idea--

00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:50.650
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Okay.

00:27:50.650 --> 00:27:51.950
&gt;&gt; Graham Allison: That
the two parties don't need

00:27:51.950 --> 00:27:54.270
to want war for war to want them.

00:27:54.270 --> 00:27:55.570
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: All right.

00:27:55.570 --> 00:27:57.050
So let's, North Korea, let's
suppose that's a potential problem.

00:27:57.050 --> 00:27:59.870
Let's talk about a second
one, the South China Sea.

00:27:59.870 --> 00:28:01.510
The Chinese have built islands.

00:28:01.510 --> 00:28:03.360
Maybe you can explain what
those islands are about,

00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:06.030
and why that's a potential problem,
and a source of confrontation

00:28:06.030 --> 00:28:08.160 position:56%
between China and the United States.

00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:10.180
&gt;&gt; Graham Allison: Well,
again, the Chinese ask,

00:28:10.180 --> 00:28:12.250
"Why are the Americans trying

00:28:12.250 --> 00:28:15.330
to decide whether we can build
an island or not if we want

00:28:15.330 --> 00:28:19.900
to in our equivalent of the
Caribbean, or who owns this island,

00:28:19.900 --> 00:28:21.200
and who owns that island?

00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:22.500
Why does that matter to you?"

00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:23.800
they ask me.

00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:26.620
And I say, "Well, let me tell you
about the history of how we came

00:28:26.620 --> 00:28:28.530
to be there, and the role we played

00:28:28.530 --> 00:28:31.990
in providing the security
order in the region."

00:28:31.990 --> 00:28:36.920
So China has claimed a number
of the islands and shoals

00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:41.880 position:56%
in the South China Sea that are also
claimed either by the Philippines

00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:45.590
or by Vietnam or by
Indonesia or by others.

00:28:45.590 --> 00:28:47.570
And it's built some islands

00:28:47.570 --> 00:28:49.860
where there's a little
bit of a shoal underwater.

00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:54.030
It builds an island around
them, about 5,000 square miles

00:28:54.030 --> 00:28:56.500
of islands, so a lot of islands.

00:28:56.500 --> 00:29:02.570
And on those islands they then
locate naval bases and air strips,

00:29:02.570 --> 00:29:06.010
so that they can increase
their security,

00:29:06.010 --> 00:29:12.070 position:56%
or the role of their military forces
in the region, since they would

00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:14.490
like to be, they imagine
they should be,

00:29:14.490 --> 00:29:16.800
the dominant power in
the South China Sea.

00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:20.790
Now, in fact, what they're trying
to do was push the U.S. back,

00:29:20.790 --> 00:29:25.460
the U.S. Navy back behind the
so-called first island chain,

00:29:25.460 --> 00:29:30.410
which is the chain that goes from
Japan around to the Philippines.

00:29:30.410 --> 00:29:35.700
And now actually, if you look at
it, the U.S. Navy in situations

00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:40.400
that risk conflict actually pulls
our carriers back beyond the first

00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:43.880
island chain, because we don't
want them to be in arm's length.

00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:45.180
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Okay.

00:29:45.180 --> 00:29:46.480
All right.

00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:47.780
A third possible source
of confrontation,

00:29:47.780 --> 00:29:49.080
you point out in your
book, is Taiwan.

00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:50.380
Now what is the story on Taiwan?

00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:51.760
Who really controls Taiwan?

00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:53.060
And why are the Chinese so upset

00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:56.990
about the United States
sort of support for Taiwan?

00:29:56.990 --> 00:29:58.930
&gt;&gt; Graham Allison:
Well, one of the places

00:29:58.930 --> 00:30:04.440
where Donald Trump almost
stumbled into a big mistake was

00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:08.920 position:56%
at the transition, when he basically
said, "Well, if Taiwan wants

00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:12.040
to be a country, a free country,
why shouldn't it be a country?"

00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:16.040
And if the president of Taiwan,
you know, wants to talk to Li,

00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:17.730
why should I talk to her?"

00:30:17.730 --> 00:30:23.500
So basically Taiwan is to China
like, I don't know, California

00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:25.800
or some chunk of the U.S. is

00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:30.290
to the U.S. They believe this
is inherently China, Chinese.

00:30:30.290 --> 00:30:31.730
This is our territory.

00:30:31.730 --> 00:30:37.080
But it's an errant
province for the time being.

00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:38.580
Well, we're taking it back.

00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:43.820
So that's [inaudible] the Taiwanese
they have 25 million people living

00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:46.640
in Taiwan in a very
successful economy

00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:48.410
that functions as a
democratic system--

00:30:48.410 --> 00:30:49.710
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Right.

00:30:49.710 --> 00:30:51.010
&gt;&gt; Graham Allison:
Where people are free.

00:30:51.010 --> 00:30:54.610 position:56%
So as the Chinese mainland gets more
and more authoritarian, and more

00:30:54.610 --> 00:30:59.530 position:56%
and more stricter on what people can
do, people in Taiwan thinking less

00:30:59.530 --> 00:31:04.480
and less this is a good idea for
me to be part of this mainland.

00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:10.650
So the tension between China
and Taiwan is likely to increase

00:31:10.650 --> 00:31:16.290 position:56%
as the mainland becomes more
constraining and more authoritarian.

00:31:16.290 --> 00:31:19.380
And the Taiwanese appreciate
their democracy more.

00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:20.680
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: All right.

00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:23.330
A fourth potential source of
confrontation between China

00:31:23.330 --> 00:31:26.440
and the United States you point
out is the Senkaku Islands,

00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:28.980
which are these islands off
of Japan that some people

00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:31.100
in Japan claim are theirs, some
people in China claim are theirs.

00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:32.400
There's nobody living there.

00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:35.840
Why are these barren islands going
to cause a potential problem?

00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:38.200
&gt;&gt; Graham Allison: Well, again,
this is just part of the,

00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:40.100
think of the rising
power that's looking

00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:44.830 position:56%
out like Teddy Roosevelt was
looking out at the Caribbean saying,

00:31:44.830 --> 00:31:47.680
"What are the Spanish
doing here in Cuba?"

00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:49.900
So it's just kind of in their face.

00:31:49.900 --> 00:31:53.550
Now there's a set of islands,
as you mentioned, the Senkakus,

00:31:53.550 --> 00:31:56.500
that the Chinese call the Diaoyus,

00:31:56.500 --> 00:32:02.070
which the U.S. actually doesn't
agree in history they belong

00:32:02.070 --> 00:32:05.250
to Japan part of the time,
to China part of the time,

00:32:05.250 --> 00:32:07.540
depending on the relative
strength of the two parties.

00:32:07.540 --> 00:32:08.840
They went back and forth.

00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:12.920
The U.S. agrees about
the ultimate resolution

00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:15.800
of the ownership we do
not take a position.

00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:18.650
But we happened to give
back these islands,

00:32:18.650 --> 00:32:21.180
which we owned after the war.

00:32:21.180 --> 00:32:23.260
We took it after World War II

00:32:23.260 --> 00:32:27.100
when we gave back Okinawa
to Japan currently.

00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:30.860
And the U.S. government has said
to China three or four times,

00:32:30.860 --> 00:32:37.210
"If you attack the Senkaku
Islands, we will defend Japan."

00:32:37.210 --> 00:32:38.510
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Okay.

00:32:38.510 --> 00:32:39.810
All right.

00:32:39.810 --> 00:32:41.110
So these are potential
sources of confrontation.

00:32:41.110 --> 00:32:47.230
But right now is somebody in
the U.S. working on a strategy

00:32:47.230 --> 00:32:52.320
that might keep us from going to a
military confrontation with China?

00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:55.350
And is somebody in China working
on a confrontation strategy

00:32:55.350 --> 00:32:57.710
that might avoid a confrontation?

00:32:57.710 --> 00:32:59.010
&gt;&gt; Graham Allison:
Well, we would hope so.

00:32:59.010 --> 00:33:00.310
Okay?

00:33:00.310 --> 00:33:01.610
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:
Do you have anybody

00:33:01.610 --> 00:33:02.910
in mind you think is
working on it or?

00:33:02.910 --> 00:33:04.210
&gt;&gt; Graham Allison: Well, I think

00:33:04.210 --> 00:33:07.540
on the Chinese side
they've been fascinated

00:33:07.540 --> 00:33:12.320
by Thucydidian trap
hypothesis and the history.

00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:13.620
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:
Do they agree with you?

00:33:13.620 --> 00:33:14.920
When you go to China you
talk to Chinese leaders.

00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:17.260
Are they thinking you're
wrong in your analysis

00:33:17.260 --> 00:33:19.460
that there's a potential
confrontation going?

00:33:19.460 --> 00:33:22.040
&gt;&gt; Graham Allison: Well, Xi
Jinping holds two positions

00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:23.600
which are contradictory.

00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:25.070
On the one hand he wants to say,

00:33:25.070 --> 00:33:28.250
"There's no such thing
as Thucydides's trap."

00:33:28.250 --> 00:33:30.600
By which he means this
is not inevitable.

00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:33.920
And on the other hand we
must make a maximum effort

00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:36.550
to escape Thucydides's trap.

00:33:36.550 --> 00:33:40.210 position:56%
And he's got a lot of people working
on the question, "What do we have

00:33:40.210 --> 00:33:42.230
to do to avoid [inaudible]?"

00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:43.680
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: When you
go over there and you talk to him

00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:47.480
about this, they say your analysis
is wrong, or you're an American

00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:49.340
and you just don't know
what you're talking about.

00:33:49.340 --> 00:33:50.900
What are they mostly saying to you?

00:33:50.900 --> 00:33:52.690
&gt;&gt; Graham Allison: After
they get over the proposition

00:33:52.690 --> 00:33:55.450 position:56%
that it's not inevitable, and I say,

00:33:55.450 --> 00:33:58.280
"Thucydides didn't mean
really inevitable."

00:33:58.280 --> 00:33:59.950
And I don't say inevitable.

00:33:59.950 --> 00:34:02.320
Four out of 16 is not inevitable.

00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:03.620
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Right.

00:34:03.620 --> 00:34:04.920
&gt;&gt; Graham Allison: It's
just odds are not good.

00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:06.220
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Right.

00:34:06.220 --> 00:34:07.520
&gt;&gt; Graham Allison: It's a real
serious structural stress.

00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:08.820
Then they say, "Well,
okay, if we were trying

00:34:08.820 --> 00:34:12.170
to avoid Thucydides's trap, or
escape, what do we have to do?"

00:34:12.170 --> 00:34:13.730
And I go through my suggestions,

00:34:13.730 --> 00:34:16.350
[inaudible] you would
wish [inaudible] would be

00:34:16.350 --> 00:34:20.240
that the two governments, Xi
and Trump, would appoint two

00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:23.480
or three people each who they
trusted, and say, "You folks sit

00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:29.090
down and be imaginative, not just
within the box, very imaginative.

00:34:29.090 --> 00:34:31.820
And ask first how are
the ways that parties

00:34:31.820 --> 00:34:35.670
like Kim Jong-un could drag
us into a war we don't want?

00:34:35.670 --> 00:34:36.970
Let's be clear.

00:34:36.970 --> 00:34:39.390
How could this happen, and what
do we have to do to prevent that?"

00:34:39.390 --> 00:34:41.070
So that part would be pretty easy.

00:34:41.070 --> 00:34:48.090
Then, secondly, how do we adapt
and adjust in this relationship,

00:34:48.090 --> 00:34:50.780
which is going to be painful, in
which we're going to each have

00:34:50.780 --> 00:34:53.000
to do things different
than we have been--

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:54.300
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Right.

00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:55.600
&gt;&gt; Graham Allison: Doing before?

00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:56.900
And in that what you would
like is to distinguish

00:34:56.900 --> 00:35:00.350
between vital national
interests for each party,

00:35:00.350 --> 00:35:02.070
and things that are just vested.

00:35:02.070 --> 00:35:04.940
So some of the things that the
U.S. is doing we've been doing

00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:06.240
for 70 years.

00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:08.070
But we don't have to
be doing forever.

00:35:08.070 --> 00:35:12.820
I would say it's now my personal
view the U.S. interests in who owns

00:35:12.820 --> 00:35:17.010
which island in the South
China Sea is pretty limited.

00:35:17.010 --> 00:35:20.510
I would like to see us
fight over who the Paracels

00:35:20.510 --> 00:35:24.160
or the Scarborough
Shoals, or some island

00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:26.920
that the Chinese built
in the South China Sea.

00:35:26.920 --> 00:35:30.710
Well, then do you mean you would be
willing to compromise in some way?

00:35:30.710 --> 00:35:34.530
I would say in the Cold War we
compromised in a lot of ways.

00:35:34.530 --> 00:35:37.880
The captive nations of
Eastern Europe stayed captive

00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:39.180
for four decades.

00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:41.550 position:56%
We didn't go fight to liberate them.

00:35:41.550 --> 00:35:43.740
We dealt with this over
a longer period of time.

00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:47.930
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: So today
as you look at Thucydides's trap

00:35:47.930 --> 00:35:50.660
in the history, and you look
at the Chinese leadership,

00:35:50.660 --> 00:35:53.890
you look at the American
leadership, how likely in your view

00:35:53.890 --> 00:35:57.800
over the next five, ten or 15
or 20 years do you think it is

00:35:57.800 --> 00:36:00.430
that the United States
and China will be unable

00:36:00.430 --> 00:36:03.900
to avoid this Thucydides's trap?

00:36:03.900 --> 00:36:06.650
&gt;&gt; Graham Allison: That's
an extremely good question.

00:36:06.650 --> 00:36:09.000
That's a hard question.

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:15.520
In the book I argue I do believe
that history as usual, I'm sorry,

00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:17.050
[inaudible], business as usual.

00:36:17.050 --> 00:36:20.060
If we just do business
as usual in the U.S.

00:36:20.060 --> 00:36:23.550
/Chinese relations we'll
get history as usual.

00:36:23.550 --> 00:36:24.850
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Okay.

00:36:24.850 --> 00:36:26.150
&gt;&gt; Graham Allison: And history
as usual is pretty catastrophic.

00:36:26.150 --> 00:36:30.310
But, as I argue in the book
also, as Santiana taught us,

00:36:30.310 --> 00:36:35.660
only if we refuse to study history
are we condemned to repeat it.

00:36:35.660 --> 00:36:40.470
So, now, can I imagine the U.S.
government being as imaginative

00:36:40.470 --> 00:36:43.090
as people were in inventing
the Cold War strategy?

00:36:43.090 --> 00:36:45.520
I can. I mean we already
did this once.

00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:48.720
Could I imagine China being
inventive, especially since,

00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:51.370
as you say, they've
got a long horizon?

00:36:51.370 --> 00:36:54.430
So they prepared to take issues
and put them on the shelf

00:36:54.430 --> 00:36:56.110
for a long period of time.

00:36:56.110 --> 00:37:01.620
But I would say if the performance
for the next 20 years was,

00:37:01.620 --> 00:37:06.980
if it's no different than the
performance in the last 20 years,

00:37:06.980 --> 00:37:08.580
then I would say the likelihood

00:37:08.580 --> 00:37:14.010
of conflict is significant,
maybe 40%, yeah.

00:37:14.010 --> 00:37:15.310
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:
But conflict--

00:37:15.310 --> 00:37:16.610
&gt;&gt; Graham Allison: War.

00:37:16.610 --> 00:37:17.910
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:
Non-nuclear--

00:37:17.910 --> 00:37:19.210
&gt;&gt; Graham Allison: War.

00:37:19.210 --> 00:37:20.510
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:
Non-nuclear [inaudible].

00:37:20.510 --> 00:37:22.350
&gt;&gt; Graham Allison: Well,
I hope non-nuclear.

00:37:22.350 --> 00:37:26.930
But part of the reason why
in the Cold War the U.S.

00:37:26.930 --> 00:37:31.000
and the Soviet Union, which
became to be so cautious

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:36.230
about having a non-nuclear war
where we're killing each other,

00:37:36.230 --> 00:37:39.280
is that it's not clear
why it doesn't escalate.

00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:43.050
And, as I point out in the
book, now that you have cyber

00:37:43.050 --> 00:37:50.050
as another lubricant, as well as
the normal ways in which you can,

00:37:50.050 --> 00:37:52.310
once you have a war
going the question is,

00:37:52.310 --> 00:37:54.200
"Why should I lose at this level--

00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:55.500
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Right.

00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:56.810
&gt;&gt; Graham Allison: Rather
than move up just a level?"

00:37:56.810 --> 00:38:00.360
And Putin has already
introduced into the conversation,

00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:03.620
and the Chinese have been
looking at this very carefully,

00:38:03.620 --> 00:38:06.070
the notion that, well,
but if I'm losing

00:38:06.070 --> 00:38:10.690
at the conventional level I can
just use a tactical nuclear weapon,

00:38:10.690 --> 00:38:13.110
just a limited use
of a nuclear weapon.

00:38:13.110 --> 00:38:15.190
And while you and I
would say, "Yikes!

00:38:15.190 --> 00:38:16.580
That sounds crazy."

00:38:16.580 --> 00:38:19.890
That was actually what we
thought of doing in the Cold War

00:38:19.890 --> 00:38:22.380
when we thought we had
only a few divisions,

00:38:22.380 --> 00:38:24.720
and the Soviet Union
had a lot of divisions.

00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:28.660
So I would say stay out
of a conventional war,

00:38:28.660 --> 00:38:32.790
because don't have any
comfort or confidence

00:38:32.790 --> 00:38:34.590
that it wouldn't escalate
to something much worse.

00:38:34.590 --> 00:38:35.900
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Now
in your book we just talked

00:38:35.900 --> 00:38:38.500
about North Korea, and it's
been in the news a lot lately,

00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:42.840
so it's not quite in your book, but
your own assessment as a scholar

00:38:42.840 --> 00:38:45.750
in this area and somebody
who studied this area, China,

00:38:45.750 --> 00:38:47.560
North Korea, United States,

00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:51.990
why is it that the Chinese can't
have more influence on North Korea,

00:38:51.990 --> 00:38:56.110
and get Kim Jong-un
to seem more rational?

00:38:56.110 --> 00:38:57.410
What's the reason?

00:38:57.410 --> 00:38:58.710
&gt;&gt; Graham Allison:
That's a great question.

00:38:58.710 --> 00:39:01.380
And I think he hasn't been,

00:39:01.380 --> 00:39:06.010
he and they haven't been
sufficiently motivated to do so.

00:39:06.010 --> 00:39:10.110
China controls the oil
lifeline to North Korea.

00:39:10.110 --> 00:39:15.310
Ninety percent of all oil that
fuels the trucks and the planes

00:39:15.310 --> 00:39:19.400 position:56%
for the military, as well as the
cars for the leadership when they go

00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:22.960
to their country houses on
the weekend, comes from China.

00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:25.560
So if it squeezed that lifeline,

00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:28.200
it could have a huge
impact on North Korea.

00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:29.500
But,--

00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:30.800
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:
Why can't they do it?

00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:32.100
&gt;&gt; Graham Allison: Well, put
it in a, if you put it back

00:39:32.100 --> 00:39:36.010
into the Thucydides in context,
the Chinese when they look

00:39:36.010 --> 00:39:39.840
at this situation, as one said
to me, "Look, there's no problem

00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:45.490
in the Korean Peninsula that
wouldn't be solved if you left.

00:39:45.490 --> 00:39:47.960
The problem is you're there."

00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:52.270
I mean if the U.S. were not
on the Korean Peninsula,

00:39:52.270 --> 00:39:55.150
you would have a unified Korea.

00:39:55.150 --> 00:39:58.140
It would be a tributary
state of China.

00:39:58.140 --> 00:40:00.470
They would allow it to
have nuclear weapons.

00:40:00.470 --> 00:40:03.360
So this is, and I said to
them, "Well, wait a minute.

00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:06.370
I can understand why
you might think that.

00:40:06.370 --> 00:40:09.800
But let me tell you about my
history, how we got there.

00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:11.380
We didn't volunteer to come there.

00:40:11.380 --> 00:40:14.050
We came there because
your ally attacked them."

00:40:14.050 --> 00:40:16.070
The story I told before.

00:40:16.070 --> 00:40:20.090
So the North Korean as a
situation is extremely dangerous,

00:40:20.090 --> 00:40:25.990
because it's an overlay on
this fundamental dynamic.

00:40:25.990 --> 00:40:31.070
And I think from Xi's
point of view, if you look,

00:40:31.070 --> 00:40:35.830
he saw they're almost working
as hard to sanction South Korea

00:40:35.830 --> 00:40:39.880
for its deployment of
THAAD, of missile defenses.

00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:44.140
So look and see what's happening
to Hyundai or Samsung in China,

00:40:44.140 --> 00:40:47.440
or what's happening to
Chinese visits to South Korea.

00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:51.560
So they see this in terms of
a much more complex dynamic.

00:40:51.560 --> 00:40:53.100
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein:
Now we avoided a Hot War

00:40:53.100 --> 00:40:55.100
with the Soviet Union
you pointed out,

00:40:55.100 --> 00:40:59.440
because a containment approach
was put together by many people,

00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:02.510
the wise men, as they
were called, Robert Kenan

00:41:02.510 --> 00:41:06.080
and Robert Lovett, among others.

00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:11.760
Who are the wise men in the U.S.
government today that are going

00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:15.890
to put together this strategy
that's going to be so helpful?

00:41:15.890 --> 00:41:17.200
And wise women, too.

00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:18.890
&gt;&gt; Graham Allison:
And women, yes, yes.

00:41:18.890 --> 00:41:22.690
So two people in the
current administration

00:41:22.690 --> 00:41:28.350
who were both serious students of
Thucydides, and who have looked

00:41:28.350 --> 00:41:32.110
at the book, and thought
about it are H.R. McMaster,

00:41:32.110 --> 00:41:34.460
who's Trump's National
Security Adviser.

00:41:34.460 --> 00:41:38.130
H.R. can quote more
Thucydides than anybody.

00:41:38.130 --> 00:41:42.820
He used to teach this at
Stanford, you know, College.

00:41:42.820 --> 00:41:46.050
And Jim Mattis was
a serious historian.

00:41:46.050 --> 00:41:49.630
And Thucydides is part
of his mental library.

00:41:49.630 --> 00:41:55.040
So they can understand
Thucydides's trap risks

00:41:55.040 --> 00:41:59.400
with all the else going on.

00:41:59.400 --> 00:42:05.150
They're going to have a day, and
people whom they would engage,

00:42:05.150 --> 00:42:07.470
an exercise like what happened.

00:42:07.470 --> 00:42:10.480
In the conventions of the Cold
War strategy, I don't know.

00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:12.130
We should remember
in the Cold War case,

00:42:12.130 --> 00:42:16.090
I mean the Cold War strategy
was unbelievably imaginative.

00:42:16.090 --> 00:42:19.830
And it didn't just pop out
of anybody's head one day.

00:42:19.830 --> 00:42:26.470
Kennan wrote back his famous
telegram in the spring of 1946,

00:42:26.470 --> 00:42:30.500
just a year after World War II,
saying the Soviet Union is going

00:42:30.500 --> 00:42:32.540
to be a bigger threat
than the Nazis were.

00:42:32.540 --> 00:42:36.750
It wasn't for four more years, as
people invented the Marshall Plan

00:42:36.750 --> 00:42:41.090
and NATO and the IMF and the World
Bank, and all the other elements

00:42:41.090 --> 00:42:43.720
of the Cold War strategy,
that the thing was in place.

00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:45.990
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Now
I said earlier Robert Lovett

00:42:45.990 --> 00:42:47.290
and Robert Kennan.

00:42:47.290 --> 00:42:48.590
It should be George Kennan.

00:42:48.590 --> 00:42:49.890
But--

00:42:49.890 --> 00:42:51.190
&gt;&gt; Graham Allison: George Kennan.

00:42:51.190 --> 00:42:52.490
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: In
the two minutes we have left,

00:42:52.490 --> 00:42:53.790
I would like you to
do this in two minutes

00:42:53.790 --> 00:42:55.090
in a slightly different context.

00:42:55.090 --> 00:42:58.880 position:56%
You are the leading expert, academic
expert on the Cuban Missile Crisis.

00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:02.950
So what happened there that
avoided a confrontation?

00:43:02.950 --> 00:43:05.930
What was the brilliance of
President Kennedy or his advisors?

00:43:05.930 --> 00:43:09.890
How did we avoid it, in that case,
going to a nuclear confrontation?

00:43:09.890 --> 00:43:12.380
And what lesson would you
take away that you would give

00:43:12.380 --> 00:43:14.320
to the current administration
they should take

00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:16.570
from the Cuban Missile
Crisis in two minutes?

00:43:16.570 --> 00:43:17.870
&gt;&gt; Graham Allison: Okay.

00:43:17.870 --> 00:43:20.260
So the Cuban Missile
Crisis, for those of you

00:43:20.260 --> 00:43:24.110
who missed it, was in 1962.

00:43:24.110 --> 00:43:28.140
Okay? And it's the most dangerous
moment in recorded history.

00:43:28.140 --> 00:43:30.940
So the U.S. discovered
the Soviet Union trying

00:43:30.940 --> 00:43:33.400
to place nuclear-tipped
missiles in Cuba.

00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:35.430
Kennedy determined this
is not going to stand.

00:43:35.430 --> 00:43:37.580
We're not going to
allow this to happen.

00:43:37.580 --> 00:43:40.520
And actually took a
course of action,

00:43:40.520 --> 00:43:44.230
which he thought had a
one-in-three chance of nuclear war,

00:43:44.230 --> 00:43:48.940
to prevent the Soviet Union from
having nuclear-tipped missiles

00:43:48.940 --> 00:43:51.960
in Cuba, even though they already
had nuclear-tipped missiles

00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:53.860
in the Soviet Union
that could kill us.

00:43:53.860 --> 00:43:55.850
So that's a long complicated story.

00:43:55.850 --> 00:43:58.620
In any case, we started
it with a blockade.

00:43:58.620 --> 00:44:01.240
So no more shipments to Cuba.

00:44:01.240 --> 00:44:04.840
And then by the end of the second
week, all this was condensed

00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:11.910 position:56%
in 13 days, Kennedy gave to the
Soviet Union a very strange cocktail

00:44:11.910 --> 00:44:14.290
to Khrushchev, communicated
to him privately.

00:44:14.290 --> 00:44:16.510
First, a public demand.

00:44:16.510 --> 00:44:18.530
The missiles have to be withdrawn.

00:44:18.530 --> 00:44:23.720
Secondly, a private ultimatum
that if this doesn't happen in 24

00:44:23.720 --> 00:44:27.190
or 48 hours, I'm going
to attack these missiles.

00:44:27.190 --> 00:44:32.030
And, thirdly, a secret
sweetener that said the missiles

00:44:32.030 --> 00:44:35.870
that we have deployed in Turkey,
that you're so concerned about,

00:44:35.870 --> 00:44:37.980
I'm not going to have
any quid pro quo.

00:44:37.980 --> 00:44:41.740
But I'm telling you if we resolve
the Cuban issue in six months,

00:44:41.740 --> 00:44:43.450
those missiles will be gone.

00:44:43.450 --> 00:44:45.540
So Kennedy drew from this,

00:44:45.540 --> 00:44:49.620 position:56%
what he thought was the big takeaway
going forward, that when you get it

00:44:49.620 --> 00:44:55.450
to basically eyeball-to-eyeball,
don't give your adversary a choice

00:44:55.450 --> 00:44:58.290
between humiliation and war.

00:44:58.290 --> 00:44:59.590
Find some other--

00:44:59.590 --> 00:45:00.890
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Okay.

00:45:00.890 --> 00:45:02.190
&gt;&gt; Graham Allison: Option.

00:45:02.190 --> 00:45:04.240 position:56%
And I would hope that in this
current situation, as we look at it,

00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:07.700
we would end up finding
something equally imaginative.

00:45:07.700 --> 00:45:09.000
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: All right.

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:10.300
Well, I hope so as well.

00:45:10.300 --> 00:45:12.150
And I highly recommend this book
"Destined for War," Graham Allison.

00:45:12.150 --> 00:45:13.450
If all of you want to know more

00:45:13.450 --> 00:45:15.530
about Thucydides's
trap, please read it.

00:45:15.530 --> 00:45:17.610
And, Graham, thank you for
a great work [inaudible].

00:45:17.610 --> 00:45:18.910
&gt;&gt; Graham Allison: Thank you.

00:45:18.910 --> 00:45:21.030
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubenstein: Thank you.

00:45:21.030 --> 00:45:24.520
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
