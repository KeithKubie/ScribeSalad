actually try to feel you know what

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000
actually try to feel you know what
 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.270

we've been learning over the years is

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840
we've been learning over the years is
 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.020
we've been learning over the years is
that there's a lot of distortions well

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030
that there's a lot of distortions well
 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:07.780
that there's a lot of distortions well
so it also helps to come some nuances

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790
so it also helps to come some nuances
 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:09.760
so it also helps to come some nuances
that will correct and those distortions

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:09.770
that will correct and those distortions
 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:13.710
that will correct and those distortions
and confront distortions a little bit um

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:13.720
and confront distortions a little bit um
 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.050
and confront distortions a little bit um
so we the way that we design our own

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.060
so we the way that we design our own
 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.050

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:32.270
 
so we figured out a way to approach our

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280
so we figured out a way to approach our
 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.220
so we figured out a way to approach our
own the street project and then what

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:34.230
own the street project and then what
 

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:36.710
own the street project and then what
happens if which often happens is that

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720
happens if which often happens is that
 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.350
happens if which often happens is that
certain teams come up that just sort of

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360
certain teams come up that just sort of
 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.240

organically it could recognizes patterns

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250
organically it could recognizes patterns
 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.060
organically it could recognizes patterns
on certain angles and you have a few

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.070
on certain angles and you have a few
 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:45.590
on certain angles and you have a few
those that have been happening once

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:45.600
those that have been happening once
 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.060
those that have been happening once
we've been talking to people over the

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070
we've been talking to people over the
 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:50.540
we've been talking to people over the
years one of those is activated so I'm

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550
years one of those is activated so I'm
 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:54.040
years one of those is activated so I'm
going to give you an op- comprehensive

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:54.050
going to give you an op- comprehensive

that's happening um and what's been
 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.350
that's happening um and what's been
really important I think in that regard

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:06.360
really important I think in that regard
 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.100
really important I think in that regard
is it's showing us an answer to a
