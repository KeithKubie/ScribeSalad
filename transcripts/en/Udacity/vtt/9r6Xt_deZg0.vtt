00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Let's say that instead of going 10 m/s, this train is going 2  10⁸ m/s.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Remember, the speed of light c is 3  10⁸ m/s. So the train is moving at 2/3 the speed of light.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Obviously, no train could actually do that--well, no train except for the train of physics.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Okay and let's get this guy out of here. Things are getting dangerous on this train.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Let's put him down here by the side of the tracks where he can safely watch the train as it goes by.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Let's also imagine this train has one of those really cool and powerful train headlights.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:40.000
So we know that the speed of the train is 2  10⁸ m/s relative to the ground on this person standing there

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
and the speed of light is 3  10⁸ m/s, now what I want to know

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
at what speed is the light approach Phil and I've named our guy down here Phil.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.000
And I'll give you a hint, it's something times 10⁸m/s. It's either 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 or 9.

00:00:55.000 --> 99:59:59.000
And you just have to answer the appropriate number here.
