00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
And of course, again, we'll do this as a quiz so, my first question for you

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.860
regarding the first success-factor is this.

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:13.200
In this line here, when we pick a random (0, 1) assignment for the variables

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.820
how many variables can  we expect to get right on average?

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.720
By right, I mean, if in a satisfying assignment the variable is set to false,

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.850
then this random assignment here also sets it to false and if it needs to be set to true

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:29.960
this random assignment here also sets it to true.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.850
So, my three choices for you here are the following:

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.670
Can we expect to nearly get all the variables correct in this random assignment here?

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.840
Can we expect to get about half the variables correct in this random assignment here?

00:00:41.840 --> 99:59:59.000
Or is it not possible to make a statement about this here?
