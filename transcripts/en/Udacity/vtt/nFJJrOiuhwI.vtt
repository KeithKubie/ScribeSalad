00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.040
Okay, so here we are on my own Twitter page.

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:06.630
Let's go ahead and see if we can find the Ajax request here.

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:08.720
I'll open up Dev tools.

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:10.680
And I've got the Network tab open.

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.060
Let me scroll down really quickly.

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.960
And there we go, okay.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.490
So we can see some request happen as I scroll down.

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.720
One of those requests is called timeline, and that sounds pretty relevant, so

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:21.910
let's click on it.

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:26.310
Okay, it looks like this includes something along the line of finding tweets,

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.290
because I keep seeing tweet here.

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:29.000
All right, that looks relevant.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.438
Let's look at the response.

00:00:30.438 --> 00:00:32.780
ha, this looks like HTML to me.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.398
It looks like it's all coming within the property items_html.

00:00:37.398 --> 00:00:41.264
So, it looks like the property name is items_html
