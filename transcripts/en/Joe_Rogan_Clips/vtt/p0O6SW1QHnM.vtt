00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.670
Dude,
I don't know how you do this.
You're so friendly too.

2
00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.820
So easy going live.
You see so peaceful.

3
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.440
Like you don't seem like a shell shocked guy,

4
00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:17.550
you know,
you really don't.
You seem very,

5
00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:19.480
very even [inaudible].

6
00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.280
That's good to hear that six months ago the Amanda be,
yeah,

7
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:27.000
I mean I think I still have PTSD,
but it definitely helped.

8
00:00:27.001 --> 00:00:29.910
And I bumped into a friend of mine that the Diet Dan [inaudible] who made the

9
00:00:29.911 --> 00:00:33.630
Michael Jackson documentary,
I saw him in New York a few weeks.
Neverland.
Dr Yeah.

10
00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.990
When you said Ben,
you just seem,
you just seem a bit a bit calmer.
What,

11
00:00:36.991 --> 00:00:39.720
what is your take on that documentary?
I have not watched it,

12
00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.550
but I've heard that those two guys at testified saying that nothing had ever

13
00:00:44.551 --> 00:00:46.300
happened to them before this.
And then,

14
00:00:46.301 --> 00:00:49.680
then now they're down on their lock and now they've changed their tune and

15
00:00:49.681 --> 00:00:53.450
saying that it was,
they,
they go into that in detail in the dock and uh,

16
00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.470
basically they'd been replaced by the new young boy up to the side.

17
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.530
And then Michael reached out and said,
I need you to help me.

18
00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.110
And they say it was exciting,
the idea to be,

19
00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.030
to be back in Michael's good books and be wanted by Michael again.
So they,
they,

20
00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:09.360
they talk about that very openly.

21
00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.310
I had dinner with him a week before the film came out and I believe them
railing.

22
00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.820
Yeah.
Yeah.
And one of them certainly I think has,

23
00:01:17.821 --> 00:01:19.920
has what looks like the symptoms of Ptsd.

24
00:01:19.921 --> 00:01:23.910
And the other one I think went through therapy before he was able to talk about

25
00:01:23.911 --> 00:01:26.730
this stuff.
So I don't think that doing it for financial gain.

26
00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:31.290
What did you think about the Dr. Michael Jackson's doctor saying that he was

27
00:01:31.291 --> 00:01:34.950
chemically castrated?
Oh,
I didn't,
I didn't hear that in the near them.

28
00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:39.120
This is something that we've talked about before because his voice was so

29
00:01:39.121 --> 00:01:41.460
different.
And to me,

30
00:01:41.461 --> 00:01:44.880
I said a long time ago before his doctor came out and said he was chemically

31
00:01:44.881 --> 00:01:46.980
castrate.
I said,
these sounds like Castrato.

32
00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.330
He sounds like one of those men who are taken as boys and you know,

33
00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.720
the 18 hundreds and the 17 chose to do it.
The doctor say,
I don't know.

34
00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.060
I think the doctor is saying that his father did it to them.

35
00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.150
I think that was with,
this is the doctor that killed her mother.
Right.

36
00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:01.920
So take that with a grain of salt.
Right.

37
00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.240
But they were saying that he chemically crass treated him to preserve as voice.

38
00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.650
Which,
you know,
it sounds preposterous until you look at his frame.
I mean,

39
00:02:10.651 --> 00:02:14.460
it did not have the frame of a person who had just kissed her on the same kids

40
00:02:14.461 --> 00:02:16.410
you did.
Some of those kids he's getting on as kids,

41
00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.120
they're definitely not as kids.
I mean,

42
00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.970
so we're talking to her about how it's easy to get the facts to fit a theory,

43
00:02:21.971 --> 00:02:23.790
you know?
But those kids are not his kids.

44
00:02:23.791 --> 00:02:26.150
Those are the whitest kids you're ever going to look at it.
Yeah,

45
00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.220
they're really white.
I mean,
they're not part African American.
I mean,

46
00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.220
and he,
we got to remember before is vital.
I ego kicked in,
he was very dark.

47
00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.250
You know,
he looked like his brothers.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It looks like his father.
Yeah.

48
00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.720
I mean it's,
um,
I dunno,
I hadn't had that theory before that his kids,
his kids,

49
00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.060
when these kids really haven't had many theories,
I'm not,

50
00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.730
I didn't think that much about Michael Jackson.
So I mean,

51
00:02:47.731 --> 00:02:50.670
I think that's just been pretty much established.
Yeah.

52
00:02:50.671 --> 00:02:52.140
That his kids weren't really as kids.

53
00:02:52.141 --> 00:02:54.750
And I think is the woman that he had children with,

54
00:02:54.751 --> 00:02:59.010
I think was all on the record saying they never had sex.
Like I think,

55
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.090
I think they,
I think they talk about that as well.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I Dunno,
but it's,
it,

56
00:03:03.091 --> 00:03:03.361
when we,

57
00:03:03.361 --> 00:03:07.740
we had a similar case in the UK with Jimmy Savile at the most popular or that's,

58
00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.100
that seems even worse.

59
00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.640
And the documentary is great because it's a portrait of how you grew up,

60
00:03:11.641 --> 00:03:13.630
not just the kid,
but the family as well.

61
00:03:13.631 --> 00:03:17.470
And in some ways you groom the entire country to the point where if accusations

62
00:03:17.471 --> 00:03:22.300
come out,
everyone says,
no,
not him.
No Way.
Right.
That's,
that's how it works.

63
00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.160
Or he looked like a monster.
Yeah.

64
00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:27.310
Michael Jackson looked like a monster eventually,

65
00:03:27.311 --> 00:03:30.730
but when we always go back to him as a boy when he was seeing an ABC,

66
00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:32.830
I mean he was just adorable little kid,

67
00:03:32.831 --> 00:03:37.690
incredibly talented and so dynamic and exciting to watch.
Like God,

68
00:03:37.691 --> 00:03:42.100
he's so talented.
Look at him.
And then in thriller,
I mean everybody loved him,

69
00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:44.710
but Jimmy Savile looks like a monster in retrospect.

70
00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:48.250
I wrote to him as a kid because he had a show called Demo,
fix it.
Right.

71
00:03:48.251 --> 00:03:50.680
We had grant you your wish and then you'd sit on his lap and he'd give you a

72
00:03:50.681 --> 00:03:54.970
medal.
You got off light.
No,
no one thought he was a monster back then.
No one.

73
00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.130
But he was so hideous.
Yeah.
And,
and uh,

74
00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:02.470
Louis through did a great documentary with them.
He keeps his mother's bedroom.

75
00:04:02.471 --> 00:04:06.040
Exactly.
Was,
it was all the clothes hanging in the closet.
Yeah.
But honestly,

76
00:04:06.041 --> 00:04:10.690
in his lifetime,
this was not discussed but not questioned.
Yeah.
And like I say,

77
00:04:10.691 --> 00:04:12.640
I think he groomed the entire country.
Well,

78
00:04:12.641 --> 00:04:17.641
there's so many cases like that where you have this systemic pedophile situation

79
00:04:17.741 --> 00:04:21.250
that doesn't make sense.
Like,
how did this,
how did this last,

80
00:04:21.251 --> 00:04:25.660
like Penn state,
like the Sandusky case,
like how did this,
how did,

81
00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.970
everyone seems to have known about it.

82
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.800
How did it last and people had seen a kid in the shower and hadn't,
I mean,

83
00:04:32.801 --> 00:04:34.240
yeah,
you think now you'd,
you'd,

84
00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.390
you'd kill yourself if you didn't intervene in some way.

85
00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.470
I think it's also easy to forget how much that wasn't part of the conversations

86
00:04:41.471 --> 00:04:42.370
back then though.
You know,

87
00:04:42.371 --> 00:04:46.150
the idea that there are pedophiles out there and it's actually incredibly

88
00:04:46.151 --> 00:04:48.070
widespread.
That just wasn't right.

89
00:04:48.071 --> 00:04:50.320
That wasn't something people were worried about back then from my memory,

90
00:04:50.321 --> 00:04:54.790
at least anyway.
No,
it was church who was Catholic Church priests.

91
00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:57.730
We knew about that every other than that,

92
00:04:57.731 --> 00:05:02.731
but there was no discussion of like some world famous football coach was

93
00:05:02.741 --> 00:05:06.700
secretly fucking kids like that.
You never heard that.
I mean,

94
00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:10.030
and paternal,
they think [inaudible] had to have known.

95
00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:13.890
There's no way he couldn't have known or at least been exposed to some of it and

96
00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:15.340
to the conversation we had earlier.

97
00:05:15.341 --> 00:05:19.300
I remember that great documentary where a guide protest in front of the statue

98
00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:23.380
and another guy comes up and tries to beat him up just for daring to suggest

99
00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:27.370
that,
you know,
this,
this hero of his would be capable of that.
People just,

100
00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:30.880
you know,
they just can't fathom it because they've been so well groomed,

101
00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:34.150
but also Penn state football was just sucks.
It's a religion.

102
00:05:34.151 --> 00:05:36.010
It's so important to them and to,

103
00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:41.020
to see that these people that were in charge of it,
we're so fucked up,
man.

104
00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:46.510
Jesus man's shows a bummer.
Sorry about that.
