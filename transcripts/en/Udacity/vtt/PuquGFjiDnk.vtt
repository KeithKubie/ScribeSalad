00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.920
Here's a filled in version of our table. Notice again, how we can

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:07.950
see that the signs of the quantities, x minus 5 and then x plus 7 are related to

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.520
the sign of their product. If we have a negative number times a negative number,

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:15.340
it always gives us a positive number. Anything times 0 is 0. And if

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.820
we have a negative and a positive multiplied together, we get a negative number.
