00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.724
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So increasing 1 foot in each direction increased the total area from 150 to

00:00:04.724 --> 00:00:09.383
176 feet squared or, in other words, made the area go up by 26 feet. So what

00:00:09.383 --> 00:00:14.454
will happen then if we increase the dimensions by yet another foot? Do you think

00:00:14.454 --> 00:00:19.372
the area will increase by another 26 feet squared exactly? Do you think it'll

00:00:19.372 --> 00:00:24.496
increase by more than, than this? Or do you think it will increase by less than

00:00:24.496 --> 00:00:24.915
this?
