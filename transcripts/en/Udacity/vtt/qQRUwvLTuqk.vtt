00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.280
The big idea in this lesson is scan or
parallel prefix.

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:07.800
It's a very powerful primitive for
exposing data parallelism.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:12.040
It vectorizes well and it can turn
seemingly irregular serial computations

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.510
into those that are both regular and
parallel.

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:16.940
Now there's a catch.

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:21.060
If you count carefully, you might
have noticed that scans actually move

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.290
more data in total than their
sequential counterparts.

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:27.510
That fact is hidden in
the asymptotic analysis.

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.750
But let's save the topic of data
movement, communication, and

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.940
algorithms that minimize them for
a different lesson.
