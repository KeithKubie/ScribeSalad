We're Doing something a little bit different today, New York City baby

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:07.898
We made it, just checking in, got some editing to do and we got to party tonight with Samsung

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:42.380
Here's the story guys

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.769
We're in New York City Samsung has invited us out because they're releasing their new

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:52.310
Galaxy s eight so we are just here as part of the party checking things out not really much idea what to expect so inside here

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.259
They've got really cool gear 36 earrings that I just tried that now they put me in a stunt plane

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:03.929
And it was like reliving my experience of my old airplane barrel rolls, hammerhead stalls, it was really really cool. They're treating us really well

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:09.720
There's a big event going on tonight. Not sure what's happening, but they also introduced the new gear 360 which is pretty much

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:18.059
360 Rig it will stream virtual reality, and it can do it live. Hoping they are going to give us one no free handouts yet

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.060
We're still looking

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:41.959
Brooklyn Bridge right here

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:58.130
Hey update guys. It's got a little bit dapper because we're over here at the Lincoln Center actually don't know what's going on

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:03.229
It's Casey's event tonight. We're talking [about] the new Galaxy S eight. I believe. Here we are

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:52.669

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.349

Okay guys. We were back the trip is over that was incredible my first experience in New York City

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:30.870
[and] it was amazing and coming up with so many different creators to walk down on the Brooklyn Bridge City, too see New York City

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:33.809
The only thing I regret is they did not get to try the pizza

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:37.050
So I will have to be back for the pizza really big and sincere

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.449
Thanks to samsung because on my way out the hotel this morning

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:43.200
They handed me a brand new gear 360 rig and on the airplane ride home

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:46.890
There was an entire school group of people who are familiar with my channel

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:51.419
So we got a chance to take a big 360 selfie with all them and post on my Facebook page very cool

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:55.949
So I'm looking forward to exploring with this equipment in the future ton of fun looking forward to doing something like that again

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:59.129
