00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.158
Up to this point a vertex has been defined by just a 3D coordinate, in fact you

00:00:03.158 --> 00:00:07.607
can attach a large amount of data to each vertex. Data attached in this way is

00:00:07.607 --> 00:00:11.463
called an attribute in WebGL. To visualize a slice through the color cube we'll

00:00:11.463 --> 00:00:15.130
attach a different color to each vertex. To start you'll add a triangle to the

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:18.450
scene. To then add a color per vertex use the following kinds of code after

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:22.718
defining the triangle's face. This last lines adds the RGB color attribute by

00:00:22.718 --> 00:00:27.408
specifying a color at each vertex of the face. Your task in this exercise is to

00:00:27.408 --> 00:00:30.480
make a triangle with three vertices at these locations and with these colors

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.595
attached. Instead of these colors in the example code, add a full red color to

00:00:34.595 --> 00:00:38.940
the first vertex, a full green to the second, full blue to the third. The GPU

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.910
will interpolate the colors across the surface, giving a blend of these colors

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.138
in the triangle's interior. To interpolate means to find a value in between two

00:00:46.138 --> 00:00:50.110
or more other values. In this case the original data are the three corner

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.777
colors, red, green and blue. For example, this point on the polygon is closest

00:00:53.777 --> 00:00:56.644
to the green so it gets more of that color, less of the red and less yet still

00:00:56.644 --> 00:01:01.071
of the blue. When you're done with this exercise the result should look like

00:01:01.071 --> 00:01:01.859
this.
