00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.840
Here's a solution to that example with three titles.

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.010
And note that we have in doing this, we have left out

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:11.870
unimportant words like and, and of, which are sometimes called stop words.

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:13.980
And that we have rotated the output so

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.390
that all the key words line up in a column.

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:20.290
Okay. And when quick indexes are actually published, you can see them

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:24.680
look like this and you can just go down the column to find the appropriate word.

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.080
And so we have, in this case, six lines in our output.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.240
We've removed the stop words from the, from the index list and, and

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.080
then alphabetized according to the key word.
