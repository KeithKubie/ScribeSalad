Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on as bill burn? It's time for the Thursday afternoon. Just before Friday. Monday morning podcast in, ah, just checking in on you. [inaudible] how are Ya? What's going on? Jesus Christ. I wrote my little notes here. I will collect, collect ticks instead of Celtics. Huh? Oh fuck. There's another helicopter flying over. I am out here in Los Angeles. Los Angeles is on fire. Um, that's all everybody's talking about. Oh my God. Are you okay? How are you anywhere near the fire. I am fine. I am fine. I have not had to evacuate yet. I have a, I've driven past the fires. It's just, it's just what happens out here. Plus a global warming is the issue. Earlier this year we had unseasonably high rains in the hills, turn green. It looked like fucking Portland, Oregon and the fucking dumb ass may or out his leg. The drought is over.

Speaker 1:          00:01:01       Everybody goes back to water and they're fucking lines and it's just like the drought is never over out here. It's over fucking populated and we live in a place that should not exist. Okay. That is such a fucking irresponsible statement. We have enough water now where there isn't a drought, but please conserve it because we don't know when it's gonna rain like that again. Thank you. And it's, you know, it's on to Chicago and let's win there. That's what the fuck she should have said. Oh Hey, I know where the fuck it was. Right? So all it did was just fatten up the fucking lands that always burned out here. Anyways, so Santa and Wednesday come in after my Javvi desert over there. It's like a giant fucking hair dry. It dries out the fucking they'll fuck in the hills in it. Lights on fire.

Speaker 1:          00:01:42       The problem is people live there now. So then that's when it becomes a problem. Mike, oh, are you going? How are they gonna get their fucking Prius out of there? Um, by the way, I love all the people playing like politics, you know, going good. All those fucking liberals are burning out there. It's a, La is one of the most conservative fucking places you're ever going to live in. The second she get into the valley, just get out of there. Get out of Hollywood with all these starlets solving problems as they accept a fucking award. You know, let's not forget about the fucking planet poses in the cove next to the blood diamonds. Thank you so much. This one's for all the fat bitches, right? Whatever the fuck it is. They say, you know, before they jump in their limo back to the fucking gated community outside, outside, you just go to Burbank and they're making it great again.

Speaker 1:          00:02:35       All right. And first of all, what kind of a fucking ass watch his fellow Americans houses burned down, you know, and they actually are happy about it. You know what I mean? This is how fucked up like, like politics has become in this, in this goddamn country. However, I feel like Hollywood did bring it on themselves with their fucking finger wagon. You know, I told you that fucking jerk off. So this guy on Twitter and he goes, okay, in case you didn't take your smart pills today, um, Obama is awesome. It's just like, look, how dumb are you that that's how you'd present your point. As opposed to me who just calls everybody comes, he should do it the way that I do it. So anyways, I'm watching all of this shit happen and knowing that, you know, and I believe anyways that we are playing a major role in it is really depressing.

Speaker 1:          00:03:29       But I've, I've now I've got myself in a positive mindset about it. I just think they, they, they're going to look at like the last hundred years is just this, um, period in our history where we were wrong. I mean, it's not wrong with oil. We didn't fucking realize that it was going to do all of this shit. But now we know and I think there's getting in the future, I think that we're going to, hopefully we'll utilize solar power, wind, uh, water or whatever the fuck it is at these egg heads know how to use, I mean, I show you, I saw that flash like the other day. It just runs on water. I mean, we, we can do stuff like this and we can live happily. All right. We don't need to cut beaks off chickens. You know, I think in every period, like when you look at how we get to live right now, it's fucking amazing.

Speaker 1:          00:04:19       And even still how we treat each other is amazing compared to way we did it for 500 years ago. Well, eventually there's going to be four or 500 years beyond this and they're going to be looking at us like they were barbarians and they were spraying on leaded fuel until the address. Fear was hating. God, policies were burning down. They bought the big stuff that chickens. Right. You know, as we sit there thinking we're fucking amazing because we can take a pill that makes her dick stand up even though we're 85. Um, so I think we're going to come out of it. I think, uh, what has to happen is to solar people have to start paying off politicians the way the oil people do. And once that happens, then hopefully what will happen is the same thing that happened in my business where I watched everybody being at the big three networks all of a sudden wanting to be over at Netflix.

Speaker 1:          00:05:09       So if you look at the big three, like NBC, ABC, and CBS is, you know, the oil companies, hopefully everybody will jump over to like solar stuff. And I know what people are saying. They, well, you know, you need fucking January, January, she boogie [inaudible] I know, I realize that. I realize that there's always going to be some sort of lubricant. Um, I understand that. But you know, have you seen that, that, that fucking shit that Tesla guy came out with where they got the, they got the, uh, the roof tiles that are solar. I don't know if they work yet. I don't know if he can even fucking get it. But if those things fucking work, and I mean there's a thing, there's a thing that below $1 billion a month on, right as a plos post, a fly and [inaudible] trying to find fucking people with the little bag of dynamite and some nails in it.

Speaker 1:          00:05:57       Those little cock suckers over there, man, they fucking bankrupt in us running around with a little trick or treat bag and we'll fucking see sitting in $1 billion worth of shit at him every fucking month. They're never going to defeat us in that game. They're going to kill this fucking financially. That's it. I'm off my tree stump that just burned down. One of the great things about spending a lot of time alone is nobody debates the points you're making. So you always feel like you're right. And that's what I'm doing right now. Um, please by all means, don't take any of this shit seriously. Alright? I'm just fucking around. I talk about what's in the news. Okay? Don't get your red tie. Oh, your blue tie or your fucking panties in a bunch.

Speaker 2:          00:06:41       Alright. Grow the fuck up. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:06:49       hey, what's going on this weekend? Not The fucking La Rams. The who would have thought La fucking rams. What are they? 92, 10 and two. I don't know where the fuck we are. I'm too busy editing. The third season of F is for family. Um, I don't know where the hell we are. God dammit. It's already December. Can you believe that the regular season of football is almost over? The regular season of college football is already over. We're already into the bowl season. It's just unfucking believable how fast the football season goes by September, October, November, December. If you look at baseball, that's April, May, June, July. Well, no wonder they still play September. We've also, they still play September, August, September and into October and into fucking November. Oh, there you go.

Speaker 1:          00:07:39       Unfucking believable. Um, well I guess they play into February here, right? Who knows. Anyways, um, I was actually going to have time next week to, uh, start flying again. The helicopter. I was going to try and get up to 150 hours by the end of the year. And I had this flight I wanted to do from long beach up to Bakersfield over to Santa Barbara and then back down to a long beach and was going gonna take me roughly like three hours. And I was going to do that about five, six times and I was going to get my, uh, um, I was going to be up to 150 hours and uh, then the fire's games and I was like, all right, you know what, I'm not going to be another asshole up there in the fucking way. And plus I don't want to have to deal with trying to fly around that shit.

Speaker 1:          00:08:26       So, uh, I don't know, maybe I'll do it in January cause I'm taking most of January off. Um, by the way, I was going to be in Santa Barbara this weekend. That got moved. Um, that got cancelled and moved because of the fires. Um, so I don't know, maybe in February or something like that. I'll let you guys know what the a three sheds you'll date is. Um, anyways, let's, uh, let's move ahead. Um, oh, and also I forgot to trash the liberals that we're happy that Rupert Murdoch's house caught on fire too. I mean, do you just, you just beyond a childish cunt, if watching another person's house on fire because you don't agree with their fucking political, but views, it's just, that just blows my mind, you know, I don't know. Look, if it's Thai caught on fire anymore, blah, blah, blah. Well, when he had to pat it off, cause I mean, that's funny.

Speaker 1:          00:09:21       You know, the guy's got a zillion fucking ties. He probably has a zillion houses too. I mean, what, what am I saying here? I'll tell you what I'm saying. I watched the Celtics, I'm getting caught up on the sellies, the Celtics. I watched my Bruins, uh, make a valiant effort to get back in the game with Nashville, which they did a bright, as I said, in the second period, I was just like, just come on man. Let's go one fucking goal here before the end of the second period. They did still ended up losing a five to three, but, um, I dunno, I dunno what the Bruins are doing, you know, I was like, what the fuck are they doing when they blew up the team and then we started to make some progress last year and this year I know what I think we just have, we had a bunch of injuries and shit, so I'm still holding out hope that they know what they're doing. But I just, I think we just signed some guy that was more of a physical presence, but somebody we're still feeling the effects of not having Lou Cheech out there, man. Every three or four shifts. But, uh, I watched the Celtics first, the, uh, the Milwaukee Bucks and I watch that Yannis, uh, super cal fragile, whatever his fucking name is. Uh, the Greek freak. Jesus Christ. Yes. The difference between him last year when the Celtics played, and this year, I mean, that guy was unbelievable.

Speaker 1:          00:10:40       Yeah. He had every, every fucking shot you could possibly have. The guy's hitting fucking three pointers. He was dunking on gay. He was dunking on guys. He was like 12 feet away from the rim, and he would just reach his fucking arm. Just keeps going. Um, I got to see that guy live that is, uh, that's, uh, when he's fucking young, before his knees and they start, you know, like, you know, like when you look at Tom Brady and he was like, what do you see as socks? And you can see there's all kinds of metal and shit underneath his fucking socks now. Um hmm. Or like Allen Iverson, who by the end was wearing like a catsuit, you know, they had like those compression sleeves and then you got one on your leg. Um, I want to see that dude when he's fucking young, you know, not favored and injury, just dunking on people the way I saw the other night. It was, it was, it was an incredible display. Um, I got to start watching them. I just don't have fucking time. I, this is what I take. I take Bruins, Celtics, patriots, and Duke University.

Speaker 3:          00:11:43       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:11:44       And I try to stay up on those as much as I can. And, um, I got to start taping the Kansas Jayhawks too. And there's just, there's just not enough fucking time. Kansas Jayhawks that's my first team. That's my first team. But I got into Duke last year when I went to that game and, um,

Speaker 4:          00:12:00       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:12:01       I Dunno. And I also, I called in this show and I got to talk to coach k and he was talking about like how hard it is to recruit now, uh, because everybody's like one and done and he somehow got another whole batch of one and done or said or the shit. Two or three guys and a, I dunno, it's like what Kentucky does every year, but a, I don't know what happened to me. I've slowly become like a college sports fan while trying to still pay attention to the pro shit. Still not knowing what the Los Angeles Rams record is. All right. Well we got, we got, Jared was hitting golf Joffe, however the fuck he sits at his, his last name is like, how do you say Gif Gif said Gif is it Gif, um, versus, uh, Carson Wentz. Um, although I got to tell you after watching the Seattle Seahawks last fucking week, I mean that was, that was a, that was an MVP level performance by Russell Wilson.

Speaker 1:          00:13:02       I don't know, I couldn't even tell how good their offensive life. It was good if it just absolutely sucked. It was like every fucking play drop back for a pass. They'd be like three eagles, you know, defensive lineman in his face and he would just fucking zigzag around up dead changed direction. Do is spin. The one thing I will say about the Seahawks offensive line is they are really good about not holding when some shit like that because usually when somebody changes direction somebodies like, oh fuck, now you're going back the other way. Then they just, there they can't fight the urge to just hold. They were really good about not doing that shit I guess when you can't really tackle somebody, there's no reason to block. But um, I was really, really impressed with how well Pete Carroll had those guys playing in the fact that, uh, Sherman was out with the ruptured Achilles and you hate to see that. Where is the fun beating Seattle? If sh, you know, Sherman isn't playing, you're not beating the Seahawks. I mean, come on, you're beating an injured fucking team, but they stay still looked. Uh, I think the Patriots, Jesus Christ, we don't get enough pressure on the quarterback. Forget about a guy that runs around like that. I would not want to play those guys. Um, there I admitted it. They were scary fucking team quite. Let me read a little bit of, um, let me read a little bit of this shit here.

I didn't watch people getting fucking slapped by gorillas on fucking youtube, but didn't exist. Okay. I ended up pure fucking mind. I went outside, I picked up a stick and I played cowboys and Indians and reenacted the genocide that made this country. What it is. Okay. I was innocent.

Speaker 2:          00:24:01       All right. But it's not in my brain right now. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:24:04       and I'm actually liking the Goddamn food. I finally went to steel cut oats. Uh, and for some reason on this diet, I'm putting a little brown sugar and a little bit of butter in there. It's been fucking tremendous. And I know there's all these people and I don't like that. Glad is going to clog up your arteries. You know what? Fuck you, I got to eat something.

Speaker 2:          00:24:26       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:24:27       Then I have a couple of eggs over AEG.

Speaker 1:          00:24:31       I, I got this other thing that I can make some times of breakfast where it's just keen what black beans in an egg. I throw a little salsa on top, fucking delicious. I just don't wrap it up. One of those giant flour tortillas, you know, with the fucking, you know what the deal is. Then all of a sudden you start throwing the sour cream on and the cheese and all of that shit and you literally like you fucking, you leave the Taco stand and you fucking walking out like lean into one side, like someone punched in your fucking ribs.

Speaker 2:          00:24:59       Um, yeah. And then also I, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:25:05       my teeth will get fucked up down the bottom. Just as you get older, I guess your job keeps growing or whatever. This is whatever the fucking dentist told me. So I actually, I finally bit the bullet and I got that fucking Invisalign, so I got to wear that thing for the next 12 to 16 weeks and I'll do it. I'll tell you right now, dude, it fucking sucks.

Speaker 2:          00:25:34       MMM.

I'm getting my fucking teeth down the bottom because I was starting to look like a fucking, I dunno what some sort of a, where are my references today? I don't know why the hell they are. I'm trying to think that there's a couple of fucking wild.

Speaker 2:          00:26:08       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:26:08       What's dead fucking thing that exists in

Speaker 2:          00:26:11       mmm,

Speaker 1:          00:26:12       South American. It's the worst kind of animal to be. It's like you would, you're like, you exist to keep the top predators alive.

Speaker 1:          00:27:46       By the way, Dude. Yeah. I have South American man. I've, I've wanted to go there for so God damn long. I just don't have the time. I'd love to go down there and do a fucking show, you know, I've always wanted to go to the Galapagos Islands. All of this shit. It just seems green and beautiful. You know, I don't know. I gotta get my ass fucking down there at some point. Why? Why the hell wouldn't I? If I talk about global warming, why don't I jump on a fucking jet plane and spray on leaded leaded fuel across the fucking atmosphere for a good 12 hour flight from La. This is how dumb I am. I actually thought, cause I moved out here, I was actually, it's a shorter flight to fucking like Brazil or something. I didn't realize that like, you know when you look at it, if you were in New York and he flew due south, you'd be on the east, the west coast of their country.

Speaker 1:          00:28:38       Um, yeah. Bill. Yeah, we all have a globe. We've all looked at a map at some point. Well you know what, sometimes I don't look at Shit. Um, anyways, so I don't know shit about NFL football this year. So I'm actually gonna go out on a limb here and say something that is based on watching one football game. Um, I'm actually thinking all right that the winner of the Rams Eagles game will fucking lose to Seattle or the Seattle might be on the road, can play off time. I have no, can you imagine if Marshawn lynch didn't fuck them, retire and kept, was still playing with them, but they got that other kid, that fucking mini Marshawn that came with a fucking maniac. Like I don't know what p care, what the Fuck Pete Carol does, you know, aside from looking the other way, would half his defense is doing fucking steroids?

Speaker 1:          00:29:30       I don't know what they are. What's in the water up there in Seattle, but they got some people that could fucking play. Um, all right, I'm done blowing the Seattle Seahawks. Um, all right, that's the podcast here for this, uh, this wonderful Thursday, um, all sober bill who would have thought all slender sober bill. I finally stood on the scale today up to fucking not booze and eating like a fucking Hollywood douche. And um, you know, when I went back in August, I was pushing like, I was like one 87. I was pushing like a push and you know, it's closing in on 200 days. Um, I'm now down to about, I said one 71.6. It's perfect. My clothes fit now and this is what I'm going to do this time. All right. I'm actually going to buy jeans that fit, you know, when I'm this weight because the problem is, is I have a bump. All my jeans fit me when I'm one 87 so as I put on the way, and I don't notice, I'm all comfortable, I just fucking walking around my big fucking Jade's Oh, Billy big jeans. Oh, that might be my favorite one. Oh, Billy big jeans. I'm not fucking doing it anymore. Do you understand me? These still speak English of fucking Bob. I'm gonna uh, does like a skid row right down the street from me. I don't go to goodwill anymore. I don't trust those cuts. All right? What I do is I go down to skid row and I got,

Speaker 5:          00:31:06       Hey, you homeless mother fuckers want free clothes?

Speaker 1:          00:31:11       Um, no, I don't do that. I s you know, anybody who is sort of my size step right up. I just know I go down and I just have the bag and I walk up to where their tents are and I just fucking set it down and I turned around and I walk away like fucking Santa Claus for junkies. Okay. And I got all kinds of shit in there, you know? And it's just funny to me that uh, that I'm, I'm giving away clothes that like, maybe I like this, some like fucking homeless guy walking around wearing a shirt that I wore on Conan O'brien.

Speaker 1:          00:31:51       I know what I should be doing is going down there and thinking, oh my God, this is so sad that fellow Americans have to live this way. But I am such a self involved Hollywood douche. I actually walk away still thinking about how about myself and how I just gave away close that had TV credits. You know, I hate that about myself, but you know, I'm just being honest. I do. And I also feel good that I did something like that. Right? It's all that stuff that allegedly Jesus doesn't appreciate, you know, he then spraying in public, I should just do that shit. And not tell you guys that I did it, but now I'm telling you that I did it. Which takes away the, uh, the good deed because if you do a good deed, just so you can walk around and talk about her, sit down and talk about it on a podcast, you're not a good person.

Speaker 1:          00:32:43       You're a cunt and a, yeah, so that's what we learned here. You know, if there really was a Jesus, if there really was a Santa Claus did be coal in my stocking and I would be on my way to the fiery depths of health, right? According to my religion, just because I went down there and I gave the clothes, but then told you guys about it. That's how it works in my religion. That's how my religion is. I'm all right. I don't even know what the fuck I'm talking about this point. All right. That's the end of the podcast. Okay. But fortunately we have some bonus material for you. We're going to play a little music. The Great Andrew Feminists always comes up with these tracks. You guys are always out gay man. Like, who is this being? Well, Bill, you listen to all this interesting music. It's not me. It's Andrew. All right. And then after the music is over, you'll then be able to listen to a, a greatest hits podcast from a Thursday gone by from earlier this year of fucking, I don't know, whenever the hell I started these and that's how it works. And if you have a problem with that, then you know what I would do? I would go to the all things comedy network and I will listen to a different podcast. By the way, thank you guys so much for buying tickets to the Patrice O'neil comedy benefit. Um,

Speaker 6:          00:33:52       tickets are going fast. The lower level is already sold out. Now we've got the upper two decks to go. You know what? It makes a wonderful Christmas gift. Why don't you get your best guy, friend

Speaker 1:          00:34:03       a fucking, um, uh, uh,

Speaker 6:          00:34:10       Kay of candy cane fucking roses from pro flowers and get, you know, and then in the card when they think that, that you went gay for them and they're going like, oh my God, how do I still hang out with this guy? I thought it wasn't homophobic. I'm not homophobic until my best guy friend who I thought was straight has a crush on me. Is that considered homophobia?

Speaker 1:          00:34:29       Okay. If you don't have a problem with gay people, but then one of your friends who you thought was straight, then I'm going to use this. The stupid expression becomes gay, you know, like, like, like, like they caught the mumps or something. Um, tells you that this whole time that Ben gay and that they also have feelings for you if you get weirded out by that. Like, dude, I can't hang out with you for, can I hang out with you for awhile until, uh, I can't hang out. I don't think I can hang out with you.

Speaker 6:          00:34:57       I mean, a woman would say that, right? If you will. Just like, you know, I though we'd been friends for awhile, but I just want to let you know that I've developed feelings for you. Yeah. You're not coming over her apartment to fucking watch survivor at that point anymore unless, unless she has feelings for you. Right. Isn't that how it works?

Speaker 1:          00:35:14       What is it? I don't know. All right. There's a lot of times I should have stopped a podcast 10 15 minutes earlier and uh, this might be one of those times, I have no idea. But you don't want to have to do the second eye fucking shut this off is I have to put my fucking Invisalign back in. It's fine once they're fucking in there, but when you're, when you pop them in there, like it's, you know, to get the

Speaker 6:          00:35:38       best results were at 22 hours a day. You know, you ever go to the airport and you see those people who like broke their fucking ankle and then it's like they got that thing that they are, it's like a scooter and they can just rest their knee on it. This is like, this is the teeth version of that. I don't understand why those people just don't use fucking crunches. Do they have like that little upper body strength? Is their cast that fucking heavy or is it just more efficient? Those are the hard hitting questions we ask here in the podcast. All right, have a great weekend. You're constant joy. The music and the greatest hits Thursday afternoon, just before Monday. No, just pull the whole Friday. Monday morning. Paul.

Speaker 7:          00:36:21       Yay.

Speaker 4:          00:37:07       [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          00:37:07       I have the urge to make a pumpkin pie this week. I want to practice before the holidays. Uh, ginger, scumbag

Speaker 6:          00:37:18       bill. I've been a fan of yours for 15 years. Okay, so you guys got that. This guy has been a fan of mine for 15 years, so for 15 years this guy has been falling me enjoying things that I'm doing. All right? This guy's locked in for 15 years. The people that work hard every day and spend their hard earned cash. That's kind of redundant, sir. If you work hard, then you have harder and cash. All right? We've got an easy job, you know, and then you be spending your fucking teddy money, right? They'll just read the fucking email. All right. Just having fun. Bill, I've been a fan of yours for 15 years. The people that work hard every day and spend their hard earned cash to see you have been really disappointed. This is one of the classic things. When people complain, rather than just complaining for themselves, they act like they're standing in front of like a zillion people and they go,

Speaker 8:          00:38:12       relax, attention everyone. I will send the email and we'll convey all of your feelings. Get on with your day. Relax. I will handle it.

Speaker 6:          00:38:26       So evidently he has like, you know, all of these people are disappointed in me. He said, the people that follow you and made you who you are, they made me people. I didn't work hard on stand up. I was just standing there and they all said, hey yo, we have decided to make you and who you are. So sad. It'd be said, so set it be done. He said, you have made dates all around the country and then cancelled them. When Hollywood calls you to do a part, that's exactly what happened. I picked up the phone. I said hello. They said, this is Hollywood here. We're calling you to do a part c. Uh, the people that go to your shows and made you, that made you aren't making a 10th of the money that you make, but they paid to see you. Hey, ginger boy.

Speaker 6:          00:39:14       Without these fans, you're illiterate. Ass would be working at Mcdonald's at best. Now, I take offense to that, sir. Okay? Without my fan base, I would not be working at Mcdonald's. You son of a bitch, I would be unloading trucks in a warehouse. Get it straight. He goes, you're a scumbag. Be a gee, you're a scumbag page and I hope every fan realizes what you are and stops going to your shows. I will never listen to your shows or podcasts again and we'll tell everyone to do the same. You are the typical sellout to Hollywood fucking disappointment. I know you won't have the balls to read this on your podcast. Instead, you will read a letter from a 20 year old guy confused about his girlfriend sex, sexuality. This is the best part here. You're a real cunt. Fuck you and everything you do as one of the greatest endings where the greatest sending standing email ever got your a real cunt. You're the real deal. If you, if you tip over your current, you see the stamp of approval from the current factory and then it's just not, fuck you. It's fuck you in everything you do. You want to go to the grocery store? Yeah. That too. Fuck you when you're picking out apples.

Speaker 2:          00:40:39       MMM.

Speaker 6:          00:40:41       Jesus Christ, sir.

Speaker 2:          00:40:44       Okay.

Speaker 6:          00:40:44       You made me, did I have anything to do? Did I do anything that I worked? Did I not fucking go onstage and eat my balls? Learning how to do this? I guess you did. I listen. I just want to thank you for making me, uh, without your hard work of going through. I mean, I can't imagine how many, uh, I mean, how many people live in this country? I just can't imagine when you're just going through the mug book, trying to figure out who you've decided will become a professional comedian. That just is. And the fact that you also have a day job during the time where I guess you're grossly underpaid. I mean, that's just incredible to me, sir. What the fuck do you want from me? Let me ask you this, okay? If Hollywood called you and asked you to be in a movie, you're going to say, you're going to say no.

Speaker 6:          00:41:37       All right. And like you told your mom, Hey, listen Ma, don't worry. I'll come over and I'll clean up your yard this Saturday. All right? And then all of a sudden Hollywood comes to Collins says, Hey, do you want to pretend you're a lot tougher than you are and get into a gunfight and gets shot by, I don't know, whoever your favorite actor is, you're going to say, no, I have to go. Uh, I got a stick. What? You've never broken a fucking, you know what? Fuck that. Even like a play off game comes along. You've never fucking had to change a schedule, sir. I had to cancel some dates. I didn't cancel them. I rescheduled the fuck. Do you want from me? You want me to stay in the strip malls for my entire career telling jokes I did that. I'm trying to fucking, you know, and all, all, all these movies to do is make more people know who I am. So more people come out to my shows so I can keep writing more hours and having a good time. All right. I don't even know why I'm talking to you. You said you're never going to listen to my shit again, right? Are you a man of your word after you saying, I'm not a man of my word. If you're actually listened to this, then you're a fucking hypocrite. All right. What's the matter?

Speaker 9:          00:42:49       Huh?

Speaker 6:          00:42:50       Jesus Christ. You fucking pissed on your sweatpants this weekend. I don't know what the fuck that was all about and you didn't even say what it was. You may dates all around the country and then cancelled them with the fuck are you talking about? I had one tour. I had to move around and I fucking did the first two dates. Then I'm, I've made up a one to 3 cents then and add in another one that wasn't even on that original tour. So go fuck yourself. All right. All the tickets are honored and if he can't make that date, you get it refunded Jesus Christ. Do you know that Ted tour that I was going to do? I was just going to land in Boise, you know, jump on a bus and knock them all out in 10 days now because of that whole thing blew up. Now I've got to get on it, you know, second extra 10 airplane ride.

Speaker 6:          00:43:41       You don't hear me bitching, do you fucking cunt. You're a real cop. Fuck you and everything you do that was worth it. That was worth them getting mad. That's fucking tremendous, sir. You know what? As much as you do, you disappointed me. You're a real disappointment. You fucking jerk off. You've liked me for 15 years. One canceled fucking Gig and now you, now you're saying fuck me in everything I do. I make that Pumpkin pie this week. You saying fuck the pie too. That's a part of it. You're saying, fuck America. If you're saying fuck punk Pumpkin Pie.

Speaker 9:          00:44:14       Yeah,

Speaker 6:          00:44:15       but I got here, I am a real cunt. I, you know, I can't argue that.

Speaker 9:          00:44:20       Okay.

Speaker 6:          00:44:26       You know something. Could somebody please put that on a tee shirt? You're a cut. Fuck

Speaker 8:          00:50:08       I fucking ain't all those people. All those assholes. The first fucking warm day in the spring and you look out the door, you see some asshole and a tank top and fucking short shorts jogging down the fucking Goddamn River, right? Right next to the fucking river. Stupid son of a bitch is going get sick and then he's going to fucking show up and get everybody else sick. So I don't do that shit. When I get sick, I stay home and I do a podcast. That's what I do. Ah, fuck. I got one of those. Those headaches where if when you're lying down, it doesn't hurt, and then when you get up, you almost fucking tip over. You can feel every time your heart beats on either side of your forehead. Ah, fuck. You know what I noticed is such a weird night. You know, if you don't watch football like Sunday night, especially around December, they showed all the first one episodes.

Speaker 8:          00:51:03       So they got a lot of reruns and now they're trying to do some little holiday special things. I was just watching Pavarotti duets. MMM. Live from, I don't know where I'm going to guess Italy. Uh, cause it looked European. The guy's singing an Italian. I know it's opera. We sing it in anywhere else, but whatever man, I turn it on and there's Annie Lennox and that scraggly dude from the eurythmics and they're singing some song. She's a terrible dancer by the way. I'm really surprised me and he's standing there stoically and uh, in a little in his fucking Tuxedo waiting, waiting to sing. She's dancing around like a, you know, you don't like when you want to adjust your fucking underwear, but you can't use your hands cause you were in public. So you do that little weird move with you fucking, you know, sort of Elvis hole.

Speaker 8:          00:51:57       You do the WHO [inaudible] my fucking underwears up my ass. Right. If I was in Seco, had done that smoothly, that would have been, we actually would've been funny. So anyways, she's dancing like a fucking retard and he's just standing there. She's sitting there going, sweet dreams are made of these. Wait for him to be like, Eh. [inaudible] eh, but they put up, put up on up or do I even know what the fuck it is? I know what they're doing. You know, I should actually keep my voice down because, uh, downstairs is, uh, this is an old guy who lives beneath me. Um, just picture of Pat Cooper. If he wasn't funny, just keep the rage and eliminate all the brilliant jokes. That's what lives underneath me and he's a fucking cunt. And I'll tell you why, because he yells at my girlfriend. All right, it's fucking old.

Speaker 8:          00:52:52       Motherfucker yells at my girlfriend, but he only does it when I'm on the road. Okay. Cowardly bastard. So it's like, first of all, how the fuck do you know when I'm not in town? This is what happens. We have hardwood floors and you know, my gorgeous girlfriends, like most gorgeous girlfriends, they have a lot of Horry shoes. You know, all women have that little horse shoes. You know the sound they make when they go across, you know, when she tries to put them on the last seconds before she leaves. You know, you know that sound of the horseshoes, the who was shoes hitting the hardwood floors, maybe some linoleum. Have any, you guys notice that you can be engrossed in the greatest conversation ever with one of your guy friends. And the second you hear high heels hitting the floor, you immediately, both of you stopped talking.

Speaker 8:          00:53:42       You turned to look, you know, let's see. Let's see what level of horror we're talking. Oh, oh, the old business suit. Oh yeah, I have a career. I'm not that kind of girl. You're shoes are giving you a way, Wendy, we know all about you and your drunken escapades down at the Tgi Friday's. Okay, so stop with your whole demeanor. More little fucking vibe. What is going on with that fucking brought anyways to me more. And she going to age at any point. You know what, uh, when I was flying out back from Cleveland, I actually sometimes I don't want to think and I, I bought people magazine and uh, you know, you do the crossword puzzle, you feel smart and uh, start with seven across on happy days. Anson Williams. Oh God, look at that 17 letters. Um, what am I going, what am I trying to say here?

Speaker 8:          00:54:42       Yeah. So there's, so some woman had written in, um, I wish I still had the magazine. Somebody asked me if they were like, can I look at that? Can you look at it? You can fucking have it. Blow your nose on it. I don't give a shit. People magazine, um, some lady had written in, cause they had, they had written a big article on Demy Moore where they would just throw stacks, they throw hard and 48 and then this, this person had written in and response to that says sexy. So hot and 48. Yeah. Anybody could be that with botox at private chef and a fucking personal trainer. You know, women are really competitive with that shit. You know, that's like if they did an article and they talked about the toughest guy I ever on the planet, you know, no matter how much you respect them, at some point you're going to have to be like, that guy's a fag.

Speaker 8:          00:55:36       You know though all I would, you know when I would do right. No, I'm serious dude. You know I do. I will fucking, I just walk up to them, you know, like, hey bro, what's going on? Do you want, you'll look, I'm going to buy a run. Which cha the secretary looked away, dude, I front kick him right in his knee. Blow out his fucking ACL. Dude, I'm telling you it works. I'm taking this fucking Israeli shit, dude. I'm telling you, telling you I took like two classes and now I just use the fucking gears pajamas. But you know, I still feel like I know how to fight shut up. Um, yeah, there's a few girls out there who just are not aging to me more. And Courtney Cox, I dunno what to do. Just like, that's a funny thing about that Courtney Cox, uh, move, uh, show that she has, that's out right now where she's a, you know, she supposed to be like this desperate, uh, what the fuck do they call those? Uh, Jesus wolfs ducklings. Cougars. There we go. There we go. Fucking NYQUIL kicking in baby. Uh, yeah, she supposed to be this desperate cougar trying to fucking, you know, hook up with the younger guy and it's like, all right. First of all, she's still hot and she's in ridiculously good shape. And then the way they shoot her with that fucking, I don't know what the trick is that, but it basically eliminates every line in your face. So now she looks like she's like 31, 32, you know,

Speaker 8:          00:57:05       that's a hard age for a woman. So like [inaudible], that's the whole fucking thing doesn't work for me, you know, and then they got to dress like this, this, this is so fucked on that show because they're trying to appeal, I guess, to this certain segment of women that they're going to watch it who are in that situation. There's a lot of divorces out there. 53% right. But uh, and the other thing, but the other side of it is they have to make her look good. You know, they got a whore out so they kind of cancel each other out and like it doesn't make sense. I'm like looking at it going, wow, I fucking bang that girl the second she's gorgeous. Right. But then they're making her walk around like she's desperate.

Speaker 8:          00:57:47       You know? I just realized, I admitted that I watched that show. Where the fuck did I watch it too? I at least have the out that I was on the road and I was lonely. I think I watched that show by myself in my own apartment. Wow. You know, every once in awhile you find a new level of sadness in your life that you didn't even know exist like your existed. Like just so not even in touch with how pathetic you're life has become that you just openly admit something like that. And then by the end of it, you know, like if you guys were actually sitting here like halfway through it, you would have given me that look the same look you just gave you fucking iPod or your radio. Oh, your high fi, whatever the fuck you listen to this thing on. You know, cause I, but I didn't see it. That's the great thing about this podcast is when I, when I start opening up and making an ass out of myself, you guys can sit there and laugh at me and fuck, I wish you were here right now cause I would have stopped at story.

Speaker 8:          00:58:47       Wow. That's embarrassing. That is really fucking embarrassing. Um, so anyways, I'm sick. Um, and I'm getting ready to do my special, but I'm getting over this shit. I don't give a fuck. I want to thank everybody came out to see me at hilarity. He's in Cleveland this past weekend. I had a great time. And uh, you know, I want to thank nick for having me out there just to fucking great club owner, you know, salt of the Earth Guy. He's one of these guys, he's like fucking, I don't know how old the guy is. He's somewhere in his, I'll say 61 in Casey's listed and I know he's like 63, but he still lifts, still wears like a wife beater. But he's a classic guy, you know, he is still, he can still fuck somebody up. That's, you know, it's very inspirational. He was funny about him too, is that you can tell that he a, we were talking about having a temper and a, I have a temper, but I wear my more on my sleeve, which lets you know that I'm pretty much harmless, but it's, it's the guys who, you know, have a temper and they're, they're, they're really soft spoken.

Speaker 8:          00:59:54       Those are the guys who will literally twist your fucking head off like a fucking beer cap. You know, those guys, he's one of those dudes, like somebody told me you're fucking story about him doing some crazy shit. And then I asked him about it and then he's telling the story and he's just, Oh, you know, and I can't, you know, you had a situation and uh, you know, it things got interesting and uh, you know, I mean it's just one of those things is what happened. And they just like immediately moves on and then later on you find out he beat the shit out of seven guys with like a fire hydrant, you know, as opposed to the other guy who doesn't even throw a fucking punch and then adds like 97 details. Right. So I could tell the way he was standing that he was a south pass, so I start cheating to the right.

Speaker 8:          01:00:42       Right. Shut the fuck up dude. I'm telling you, I'm taking this Jujitsu stuff. You know, I started watching spike, you know, without I gotta I gotta Ghee. I went down there, I took one class that got my ass kicked, but uh, I'm really good at like seeing things for like an hour and then being able to talk about them. Like, I've been doing it for 10 years while my nose just had another level of being fucking stuffed up. Ah, okay. This is going to be a short podcast everybody. Um, all right. What else can I admit to that's fucking embarrassing. Sat, embarrassing. A Santa Claus is coming to town. Is that the name of it is on tomorrow. That that claymation thing that I used to watch as a kid and I'm recording it and I'm going to watch it with my girlfriend. Hopefully I'll have a Christmas tree up by then and uh, if I had a fireplace that we get a fire going, but I doubt so uh, I'll just late our little fuck candle.

Speaker 8:          01:01:39       Um, anyways, happy holidays to everyone. I have not even started my shopping. Um, you know, I do a thing on this podcast where people give me an a, I give people advice and this week somebody is actually giving me advice how to fuck to both nostrils get clogged up at the same time. They fuckin dog sleeps all day, all day long and then it comes in at night and is like tired from sleeping. You're a bum. Look at you. You know, I'm teaching the dog how to speak in them, but I swear to God, I give, you got to hear it. You got to hear it. It's absolutely adorable to me. It will be annoying to you. And I'm gonna. I'm gonna fucking play it. Oh, I know what I wanted to do. I wanted to go on fucking youtube and find out why Carsello got suspended against the fucking capitals. Dude. That guy, I swear to God is like Mickey Featherstone on fucking skates. Jimmy [inaudible]. You know, that's why when I look at it, he's got that same haircut. Anybody read that book? The westies. That's what he reminds me of. Like you should be in Hell's kitchen to the seventies. But he's played for the flyers. All right. Cars Sylo suspended. Let's see what this brings up. Sorry. Winston Churchill,

Speaker 8:          01:02:58       a cheap shot cars. Sylo uh, that's 2000. What the fuck did he do? But anybody knows what he did. Let me know. Just let me know what he did. He did something against the capitals. I have no fucking idea. Uh, anyways, let's get onto the advice. Somebody wanted to give me some advice this week, which is a nice turn of the, if I consider we get it as the holidays. Um, all right. Jesus Christ Carsello has more fight videos that Brittany Spears has look at my vagina videos. Thank you. That was a joke. Sorry, I'm sick. This is really bad. Come on bill. Step it up. Oh, you know, I didn't finish telling her this story about the guy downstairs, right? So this fucking asshole, this is what he does. Anytime,

Speaker 8:          01:03:44       uh, my girlfriend walks across the floor, he just goes, why does he say, he goes like, oh great, keep it up. Keep it up. He says he's real sarcastic and it infuriates my girl to no fucking dead. To the point that she's claiming that he's harassing her and she wants me to go downstairs and have a talk with this guy. There's no way this isn't going to be fucking hilarious, which I'm going to go do. Right. But I don't understand. Like if this guy, what did this guy just says? You know, why don't you go fuck yourself? What am I going to do? I mean, I wouldn't fight this guy. If he was my age, I would now I would have a fucking seven year old guy who lives alone at all. It's the same fucking thing. I'm just like, why don't you just laugh it off?

Speaker 8:          01:04:31       I dropped something. What? I was up here one time and he goes, he's real sarcastic. And he goes, do it again. And you know what I did? I did it again even harder and I yelled out. How was that? And he's never yelled at me again. You know, you guys fucking harmless. Jesus Christ having a word in your life that what I got. I got to run downstairs and confront this guy like I'm at a Bronx Tale, you know? Anyways. All right, here's the advice. I got. Jesus Christ by fucking knows this. It's done fully 19 minutes. So this is going to be a half hour one. All right guys, I'm sorry. Whatever you got shopping to do. Don't ya? Can I shop for Kwanzaa? Hanukkah? Uh, are there, how many days? A hundred car? There's, I like 13. Why don't I keep asking questions

Speaker 11:         01:05:18       about the Jewish religion? I think I'm searching for something new.

Speaker 6:          01:05:21       You know, I'm a [inaudible]

Speaker 11:         01:05:26       aware of my mortality. Um, especially with the swine flu that I caught out in Cleveland. Don't you guys just celebrated or one day or do you really have to buy somebody 13 fuck gifts and give them some every day? That's it. More that a religious bullshit. That's, that's their version of Jesus Pollard the fish out of the fucking basket where it's some Guy Dave Jebidiah. He only had enough fucking knock Zima to keep the zits off his face for five days and sub, but somehow he did it for fucking 13 rarely. Who gives a shit just set around the collection basket. We'll keep paying for your bed sheets. All right, dear bill, irregular serve you weekly podcasts, uh, which I enjoy immensely. Thank you. I noticed that on occasion that you have met should you are learning to play guitar. First of all, Kudos. Secondly, please tell me that you will never fucking incorporate any form of guitar playing into your act.

Speaker 11:         01:06:27       I know it's easy to learn a few open chords or they'd pile all your c grade material. Just a bullshit SOG. Although you could do it. I know people read idiots would laugh at you and you'd kill five, 10 minutes of set time, easy. However, please promise me you will never stoop to that level. Sincerely concerned. Fat Ass. Fucking hilarious. Yeah, dude, I have no intentions of doing that, but I hope I do do it someday. I'm standing up right now. Hopefully this will clear me up. Uh Oh. It's like magic. You're like that. Like hear me sniffle or this fucking thing. Um, I actually hope that I do that one day, sir. And you know why that is? Because that would mean that I have actually reached such a level of success that no one around me can tell me what a horrible mistake I'm fucking making with my career. You know, kind of like Al Pachino in the 90s. He was like, so, you know, such a legend at that point that one director ever pulled him aside and was like, Al, ah, you're yelling. Yeah, yeah. You're, you're just, you just sort of yelling here, not you don't act and you're just yelling. No, no, no, I'm serious. We were like on the sixth day of the shoot here and uh, you know what I mean? The scene is like, you know, two lines. You're get some coffee and a donut and I'm,

Speaker 6:          01:07:45       yeah, you just kind of yell at,

Speaker 11:         01:07:49       Oh, and I don't want to, I mean, I respect you where the Godfather, but you know, you just fuck, you know, one of those deals. So if I actually got to the point where nobody actually told me to stop, you know, to not go on stage with a guitar, do it. I'm like, I'm never gonna do that shit. I should never say never. But I'll tell you this, I, I'd be lying if I didn't already fantasize about doing it, you know, like fuck, and having the greatest hour special of all time. And then the end, my encore is I come out, I play better than Stevie Ray Vaughn, you know, and then next thing you know, I'm playing drums in them, crooked vultures. When David Grohl asked to take a night off, right? Once you guys have fantasies like that, you've got to dream big and let's sit down and watch that.

Speaker 11:         01:08:34       Courtney Cox fucking, whenever the COO fucking cougar show is, oh, he had a little epilogue here to this. He said, ps, I saw that picture of you playing with the victor Wooten band, playing drums with them and know that you've been an avid drummer for a long time. So what's it like to learn a real instrument now, boo Yah, that that's fucking guitarists are also full of themselves with their feathered hair playing the same fucking power cords that have been playing since fucking Peter Frampton. Once you guys get over yourself, you know, you know what? I hope you go to a holiday party and for no particular reason, just in, in, in this, in this, in the, in the vein of a Bronx tale, every time I think I'm a Bronx tale is Chazz. Palminteri in the end of that pistol just comes out and whacks him in the back of the head.

Speaker 11:         01:09:23       You know I helped that APP is to you, but it's a fucking Ukulele. I don't want you to die, but I just really want you to take a nice fucking get a little blunt force trauma with the Ukulele. What do you think about that? Huh? I would love to have youtube video of you alone. You know some of this stupid rock poses that you probably did back in the eighties if you're older. Huh? Did you do the point in a little kick? We did. You do the thing, the state trooper to the 10th power where you stand with your legs apart but really far apart. Huh? Admitted you ever done that? Mr Guitarist? Mister fucking musician. Ah, he never would do it. A little tap on solo in the bathroom mirror and then started flicking your tongue like you were looking at Colette. Ah, cause you saw the white snake video.

Speaker 11:         01:10:14       Did you lick your guitar? Like the Douche bag in that band? That's what I want to know. The fucking, you know, guitars are so fucking annoying. I really think, you know, they all think they're fucking virtuosos. They're not, you know, they're doing the same bullshit. I actually didn't notice that, you know, I'm not even going to say that. Why would I do that? Then it'd be shitting on a band that I fucking like. All right, let's plow ahead here. The fuck is wrong with my keyboard here. Um, all right, Bill. Oh, this is, this is what I would tell you right now. This guy's asking me for advice and I don't know. I don't know what to do on this one. Okay. So I need some help on this one. All right, Bill, I have a situation for you. Um, so I've been banging this engage girl for the past several months and we're in, we just went in with both feet. Okay. How's the water? Fine. All right. I started with the two years ago where we took a break for a year when she got in in 2008. Um, she reinitiated our arrangement over the summer.

Speaker 2:          01:11:20       Uh,

Speaker 11:         01:11:23       what the fuck? Sorry guys. I got to stand up here. So I'm looking fucking, all right. While I know it's wrong to be bagging and engaged girls. She's a petite Latin girl, a great lay a, she's 22 and a fiance lives over in London. A guy yesterday too. That's what he says. Yeah, you just justified it. However, now that the miserable son of a bitches moving from London to New York to be with her, it hit me that marriage is actually a serious move in life and this poor bass is going to be spending the rest of his life with her. That only do I feel a bit guilty though. I don't hesitate to call her at 4:00 AM when I'm at least 20 drinks deep. I feel bad for the poor guy that he's going to be marrying this slag. Maybe this girl is so fucking whore is she actually compares the size of my deck with her fiance's.

Speaker 11:         01:12:09       Wow. Uh, I mean, she thinks that I'm going to be taken as a compliment that mine is bigger and she even invited me to her wedding. What the fuck is wrong with her? Jesus Christ, dude, it is a situation. Uh, he said, I'm going to use a, I'm going to use her as exhibit a when I educate my son's on how women are complete whores. Really? So now they're all whores because of this one here. Dude, you really, you, you picked a fucking winner here. Uh, in any event, my question boils down to this. My friend suggest that I write her fiance and anonymous email. Um, I was thinking more of one of those kidnapping letters with the different letters cut out from magazines did that would be fucking hilarious. Um, about how I was, uh, whatever the letter would be about how I was begging her for the last several months. What do you think? While I hate rats, I think I'd be saving this guy in lifetime of misery. On the other hand, that bastard propose to her after only three months of meeting her. So he kind of deserves it. Am I doing this poor bastard or favor? Any advice would be appreciated. Ah, okay.

Speaker 11:         01:13:20       Okay. Okay. Okay. Where do we go with this one? What should you do?

Speaker 2:          01:13:25       MMM. [inaudible]

Speaker 11:         01:13:27       well, you know what, dude, in a perfect world, you could actually send a letter to that guy. You could tell him what was up. And once he got over the shock of it, he would actually be like, oh, thank God. You know, you know, I'm not saying he would like you, but he'd be like, thank God you did me a favor. I almost fucking married this psycho. Right? And, and then the little Latino hoary girl would be like, you know, as mad as I am at you, um, you were right. I was doing the wrong fucking thing. So I should probably shouldn't be getting married to a mature blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And uh, and then you'd stop fucking her.

Speaker 6:          01:14:12       Yeah,

Speaker 11:         01:14:12       right. That would be the perfect world. But this is probably what's going to happen. You're going to do it. This guy's going to flip out and flip out, has a whole rainbow of emotions anywhere from collapsing in the street, crying and peeing on himself to going over there and choking that woman to death. Um, and she's going to flip the fuck out at you and it's just gonna be a big fucking mess.

Speaker 6:          01:14:40       Okay?

Speaker 11:         01:14:41       You go with your gut here. What kind of a fucking asshole? What kind of a fucking asshole, you know, date somebody who lives on the other side of the fucking ocean. If you need a passport to get to the person that you're going to marry you, not only should you not marry them, you're not even in a relationship with them.

Speaker 6:          01:15:03       You know what I mean?

Speaker 11:         01:15:05       Fuck that. That's fucking retarded. You know what that is? He was so used to fuck it. All those pasty bitches over there in London with their awful fucking teeth and their fish and chips breath. All of a sudden he comes over in New York on the fucking Puerto Rican Pride Day parade and it was over. That's what happened. That's what I'm guessing.

Speaker 6:          01:15:24       Okay.

Speaker 11:         01:15:25       Couple of those little j Lo girls came walking by and he said, Holy Shit, life doesn't have to be this hard. It's just like sexy beast,

Speaker 6:          01:15:33       you know?

Speaker 11:         01:15:36       Do you ever meet the a Miss London? I remember that guy was fucking say it all. It's shit Evie Cantwell along face Dell. Make me laugh. He really made the London seem miserable. I'm just fucking with you guys. Some reason I keep shitting on England here. Yeah Dude. You know what? You got a great story. Just fucking tap out mad. You don't want to do that shit. You know, lets his story. Just tell it a bar. Fuck this guy. Fuck up.

Speaker 6:          01:16:04       You know, come on.

Speaker 11:         01:16:08       Rarely this girl is this pick up. I don't know. But women are so great at fucking lie. They really are better at than us. They lie just as much as we do. So I don't want to make this seem like I'm trashing women here. I view women that they're, they're sitting in the same mud puddle that were sitting in their animals just like us with the same fucking desires. The one thing I do like about this story is what I've been saying all along, getting into horrific arguments with my girlfriend is, you know, they, why don't they ever catch women cheating?

Speaker 6:          01:16:37       Yeah.

Speaker 11:         01:16:38       You know, tiger woods, another guy getting busted. It's like the sixth fucking famous guy to get busted, you know? So it really, people are starting to buy into this shit that guys are the only ones who cheat. And I can tell you this being a road comic, the amount of fucking married women who have approached me, I was face fucking ridiculous. You really sit there. You got your job. Oh my God. Did the fucking guy just yell at me? I think he just yelled at me. I fucking, what's he going to do? Huh? By the time he walked up all my stairs, you know what I'm saying? Um, anyways, the fuck was I just talking about. Yeah. They just did just, they're fucking, they're better at it. They're better. They already like do a mild form of lying all day long. They call it manipulation, you know, let's shut that.

Speaker 11:         01:17:32       They do, you know, they, they want something and they just immediately, they always know like, what emotion? Let me try cute. And they put their shoulders at, he did a little fucking smile. Or they do the pouty face, you know? Or do they act like they're just like this helpless little fucking thing. Those are all lies. It's just all shit tickets. That just basically means there's something that I don't want to do and I want you to do it for me and I want you to pay for it and I want you to, and not only do I want you to do, like, they're so good at it that it's not even, it's not even good enough for you to just do it for them. They want you to actually enjoy it, enjoy doing it for them like that. Like that's how much they get your fucking head spinning.

Speaker 11:         01:18:14       So that's why they never get caught. That's my, that's my belief. All right, Bill. Uh, you know, if that made sense. I sort of fucking zoned out halfway through that with the Nyquil haze I have going on here. No, actually took dayquil deny. I don't fucking know. Anyways, let's go to overrate. Underrated. Overrated. Condescending comes from Connecticut. Jesus, a little, little literation. They're condescending. Cons from Connecticut who infest New York bars and grade you on that three dimensional grid of where you work. Went to school and live these cuts, work in PR, make 30 grand a year and live off daddy's AMX and his rent checks for their Chelsea flats, uh, should be purged. That didn't even make sense, dude. I don't know if you edited that last sentence. All right. Um, do you got, you got some issues with women here. Okay. First of all, you're going to wear, there's condescending [inaudible] there's plenty of great women out there.

Speaker 11:         01:19:15       You know, he just, you're, you're fishing in the same poisoned pond. You know. What are the names of these places that you go to? I lived in New York for 12 years. I never met women like that. I never met him. I ain't one of those a Wall Street bars, you know, go to work. What are some, a little bit different? Start off with like a sports bar that, you know, what about those wine bars? Is that where you're going? People sit there and a chat? I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about. Um, I'm just trying to take the edge off of how bad women are getting trashed on this, uh, underrated. Um, what the fuck does that say? Heleo sequence a kickass band from Portland, Oregon. H e l I. L sequence. All right, I'll check those guys out. Thank you for the email.

Speaker 11:         01:20:06       All right, let's to the questions and I'm going to have to tap out guys because obviously I feel too fucking hot here. All right, questions bill. Um, love the podcast, but, but all, here's what it from a guy who actually went to my Saturday night show at hilarity. He's in Cleveland. Um, as such, I was at your late show for, uh, last Friday night, a Saturday night in Cleveland. The group I was with went out for dinner or drinks before the show and everyone was having a great time. So we get to the club, take our seats to the waitress and forms by buddy that they have some absence Martinis have set, I believe was illegal for a long time and recently now it isn't. They used to think of, make people go crazy or something like that. Um, so anyways, so he offers to buy them.

Speaker 11:         01:20:49       Uh, so I buddy offers to buy those absent Martinis for everyone in our group. Mind you, um, everyone had said that they were not planning on drinking at the club due to various obligations they had the next day. So he buys was for everyone but me, I'm driving even though no one really seems to want it. Dot. My girlfriend is a small girl as such, cannot really hold their liquor that well. So this Martini cubs that she didn't want and she begins to drink it. I see you're sipping on it throughout the opening of middle acts until it's finished. Finally, you get onstage. We're all laughing our asses off. That'll all of a sudden I noticed her stop. I look at her ask if she's okay, to which she shakes her head and says no. And she says, she needs me to take her to the bathroom. Why? I need to go. I have no idea. You know why? Because she's a fucking woman. They drag you down with them. If you had to fucking Puke, you would just get up and puke. Right? I need you to go with me.

Speaker 9:          01:21:47       Okay.

Speaker 11:         01:21:47       Fucking, Oh God, it's so fucking annoying. Why I need to go. I have no idea. I guess so I get, uh, I have no idea. I guess so I get to look like, I guess so I get to look like the Douche walking out with their behind me anyway, she ends up puking and I ended up having to take her home missing half of your show. So my question is, should I be mad at my buddy for buying her the extremely potent drink that she didn't want or should I be pissed at her for drinking it after saying she didn't want it because she didn't want to get drunk. I'm kind of mad at both of them, but more so at her because no one put a gun to her head and forced her to drink. She chose to. Um, all right. Who should you be mad at? Um,

Speaker 9:          01:22:29       MMM Christ.

Speaker 11:         01:22:29       I don't, I don't fuck it. These are hard questions.

Speaker 9:          01:22:32       Yeah.

Speaker 11:         01:22:33       Do you know what? You should kind of be mad at yourself for some hot item. First of all, you know, I need you to go with me to the bathroom. You know, that's just one of, you know what, that's one of those things where you shouldn't have to go to the fucking bathroom, but that's one of those things, if you don't, they're going to make it seem like, you know, it's Vietnam and you took off in the chopper and left him down there like fucking Willem to fall. You know what I mean? It just becomes that. Yeah, if you think I would have fucking blah, blah, blah, you know, it's amazing sweetheart. Why you're always a hero in these hypothetical situations. You know why that is? Because they're hypothetical and annoys me. Why do you have to go to the fucking bathroom? What did you do?

Speaker 11:         01:23:13       You can't go in there. What she did? You sit there with like a glass up to the door so you get to hear her puking. Um, who should you be mad at? A, you should break your fucking buddies balls and then tell your girl that she needs to take you out for a fucking something or other. Just go and make her do something for you. Break a break or fucking balls about it, you know? Cause you've got fucked in all of that. You brought your buddies a dickhead. What do, what do you care? You know, he's probably trying to bang the other girl that's at the table, right? He's doing what he's doing. He's getting everybody look it up. He's trying to be a show off, right? Yeah, absolutely. I used to be illegal writing. What is all the fucking things? I don't know. That's what, that's what I would do. I break your buddy's balls and that I'd make your girlfriend,

Speaker 2:          01:23:57       I don't know.

Speaker 11:         01:23:59       Totally go make your breakfast or something. It's sad. Is chauvinistically as possible, you know? And if she doesn't, I would just start jerking off right in front of her. But that's mate. That's what I do. All right, next question. Hey Bill, a big fan of yours from the opiate Anthony show and the Monday morning podcast. You do look to the, to the, to the quick question for you. I am a military vet. I'll do this is a brutal, this is a brutal situation, situation. Um, all right, quick question for you. I am a military veteran and I also happened to be Korean. Um, I'm in college right now and all my friends are white. When we hang out and get drunk, the ugly racist shit comes out. I know the difference between joking around in real hate. My problem is I was homeless week getting food with my dad went outside.

Speaker 11:         01:24:48       I hear, fuck you chink, yelled at us. I went blind with rage and jumped out of the car that was going about 20 miles an hour. I chased those, fuck the two fucks down, but they will, I try to, but they were too fast and got away. I'm chink is probably the racial slur that hurts the most. That shit really eats away at me and my parents are immigrants, but they work hard and I've never fucked over anyone or cheated on their taxes, etc. I felt that I served my country for a year in the desert just to come back and still be hated because I have a small, because I have small eyes and a tiny penis or you just, wow. Okay. Okay. Um, any advice on how to handle undeserved racism? Uh, many advice to help my friends understand what it's like to be a minority. Anyways, let me know what you think. A huge fan of fucking chink. I'm all right, dude. All right. The first advice I would give you is when you want somebody to understand what it feels like to be a minority, you probably shouldn't ask a white male heterosexual.

Speaker 11:         01:25:54       Because I read that whole thing and my big question was, what is when you're hanging out with your friends and they get drunk and you know all the racist stuff out, and you were like, I can tell the difference between joking and just, uh, in real hate. Uh, my question is, is why? Just because you're Korean that it just seems like my brain for half a second was like, oh, he's Korean. So because he is a minority in this country, that means he's incapable of racist thoughts. My question would be, I'll, I'll ask, I've got a question for you. Have you ever thought something fucked up? You had to have, you know, you never saw a black guy coming down the street like, oh, this guy's going to rob me. And then it turned out, uh, you know, he just cured pancreatic cancer or some shit. You know, that never happened. Who doesn't have that fucking story? Right. It doesn't make you a bad person, but what are you supposed to do? Come of age when gangster rap is on the television. You live in the white suburbs. You don't know any better. Um, the fuck am I doing here? Let me try to answer this question. Well, what the fuck was the question? Um, any advice on how to handle undeserved racism?

Speaker 11:         01:27:10       Oh Jeez. I mean, I dunno. I Dunno what intuit, in a perfect world, you could go out there and beat the living shit out of him and everyone else would cheer you on as you did it, you know, and then buy a drink for serving the country. I mean, that's, you know, the world I would like to live in. You know, you wouldn't kill those people. Well, I guess you would cause they're not gonna change. Yeah. Fuck it.

Speaker 9:          01:27:29       Okay.

Speaker 11:         01:27:29       You know, then I'll have to traffic a little bit. Um, I don't know what to tell you, dude. Well, why don't you, um, I'm not trying to be an asshole here, but I would, I would probably not hang out with people who got drunk and suddenly started to sound racist. You know, I would pick a better group of friends. I mean, it's bad enough. You got to hear it from strangers. I wouldn't want my inner circle of people like, you know, that's not a good thing. That's not a good sign. Do you know, when I get drunk, I like to explain stuff. I don't just start, you know, putting on a Klan Hood. So that would be my advice. I would get some better friends. And, um, as far as helping your friends to understand what it's like to be a minority, I just, they're not going to be able to understand it.

Speaker 11:         01:28:19       Yeah. It's, they're just not, they would have to, uh, move to South Africa and to have a farm that was being taken away from him or some shit, uh, they'd have to do it like that. You know, I don't know. And even then they would still have the arrogance of a, I am a fucking from the white race. They'd still have that card to throw it down, you know? But it really got ugly, you know? So, uh, I don't think, yeah, I don't think somebody white could ever understand that. You know, you can empathize, you can listen to the stories and nod and have a concerned look on your face. But at the end of the day, you know, I don't know. Well, let me ask you this, like a Koreans. All right. Now as far as I know about Asia, Japanese are sort of, the white people have a, of Asia, you know, well, they kind of don't take, kind of consider themselves superior or they look down on the Chinese and the Koreans and that type of shit.

Speaker 11:         01:29:08       And they've kind of been just a little country with their little shogun warrior practices. Is that what they tried to do? The rape and Dan King and all that shit that they did in World War Two? You know, how to Koreans feel, why am I asking you this? Man? You're from America. Have you ever robbed me? I haven't read any books on Ireland or Germany. Yeah, I'm an asshole. Yeah. I wouldn't even fly by you even listening to this. Um, anyways. You know what I would do? Said Steve Bird in email, comedian Steve Byrne, hilarious comedian. And he is, uh, he's half white, half Korean? I believe so.

Speaker 2:          01:29:46       Um, yeah.

Speaker 11:         01:29:47       He'd probably tell you to punch him in the face if I know him. He likes to play hockey. All right. More overrated. Underrated. Uh, I had a great time, but you show in Cleveland. Did it, it today underrate. Okay. Um, your, um, okay, there's this eat this guy basically did an overrated, underrated from the show that he saw me do. He said underrated the way nonsmokers smell.

Speaker 2:          01:30:11       MMM.

Speaker 11:         01:30:12       I'm not saying that your fans steak, but sweet Jesus Christ. I kept looking around during your set because I could've sworn that someone was smoking a cigarette, especially those two Hicks who are heckling you. I was behind the midline for your DVD or they just reeked of cheap tobacco would booze. I'm not some militant anti smoking guy. As a matter of fact, I quit smoking about four months ago. I'm just horrified that I smelled that bad for 20 years and wasn't even aware of it. The other underrated people who don't have to tell you every thought that pops into their head, the guy sitting behind me at your show is easily the guy who was laughing the loudest, which I'm guessing is good for you as a comedian. Uh, what you couldn't hear, thankfully his, the way he would comment on almost everything you said on stage.

Speaker 2:          01:30:59       MMM.

Speaker 11:         01:31:00       Now he goes to give some examples. Uh, what a great analogy bill just made. That is really, that is a really old reference. That's hilarious. I can't believe bill just said that. Jesus, how did you not punch that guy in the throat? And he said he did about a thousand more deep observations. Obviously he's being sarcastic. Uh, I was glad it was enjoyed your show so much, but fuck, I just want it to turn around and tell him it's okay to just think these things that you should have said that, uh, you don't think, uh, you don't have to tell your buddy every reaction you're having to build, choke, save something for the ride home for Christ's sake. But I didn't say anything because of a peace loving pussy who just sits there and lets people know him. Thanks for the great show and was nice to meet you afterwards.

Speaker 11:         01:31:45       All right dude. Sorry you had that bad time. Yeah, that was a weird show. I just had a couple of couple of drugs there who thought they were helping the show and uh, they weren't. So I fucked with him a couple of times and then I just had to deliberately make it uncomfortable. And then I got out of it. And then what ended up happening was most people didn't even hear him. So they were like, what did they say? What did they say? They were yelling Jew and then they kept yelling, faggot. That's what they were doing. I don't know why I made a reference to a Drayton and then they thought it would be funny if they just kept yelling Jews.

Speaker 11:         01:32:25       I don't know why they were vibing on, on some shit. And then I was talking about some sort of homophobic thing and then they were yelling, you faggot, you fucking faggot. Faggot. The whole, the entire joke, like every two and a half seconds. Uh, and in their world it was hilarious and it was helping my set. So where are you going to do all right? I, uh, I'm going to go take a bath is a visual for you. I'm all fucking aches and pains here and I'm not gonna fucking take a shower like a fucking man. Uh, that's it. That's some money money podcast this week. I apologize for the, uh, the nasal problems here and, uh, I apologize to my country downstairs neighbor. Everybody have a great week and a police come out and see me up at a, the punchline up in Sacramento, um, uninformed radio.com to listen to my radio show with the wonderful Joe Derosa, the teen idol, a teen idol sensation of the opiate Anthony Radio Program on Sirius Xm. What else can I hype? I think that's it. Got a billboard.com I have about five people on my mailing list away from having 10,000 people on my mailing list, and I would like as a Christmas gift for four of you to sign up for it. Could you do that? Lovely. And that's it. You guys have a great week and I'll talk
