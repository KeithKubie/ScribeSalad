00:00:00.423 --> 00:00:02.118
- [Voiceover] Hiro
painted his room at a rate

00:00:02.118 --> 00:00:05.114
of eight square meters per hour.

00:00:05.114 --> 00:00:06.855
After three hours of painting,

00:00:06.855 --> 00:00:10.327
he had 28 square meters left to paint.

00:00:10.327 --> 00:00:12.846
So after three hours of painting,

00:00:12.846 --> 00:00:15.701
he had 28 square meters left to paint.

00:00:15.701 --> 00:00:16.724
So they're talking in terms

00:00:16.724 --> 00:00:17.722
of how much we have left to paint,

00:00:17.722 --> 00:00:19.650
not how much we have painted.

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.691
Let A of t denote the area to paint,

00:00:22.691 --> 00:00:26.194
A measured in square meters
as a function of time, t,

00:00:26.194 --> 00:00:27.517
measured in hours.

00:00:27.517 --> 00:00:30.141
So A of t, once again, this
is how much we have to paint,

00:00:30.141 --> 00:00:32.649
not how much we have painted.

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:35.261
Write the function's formula.

00:00:35.261 --> 00:00:36.817
So what I like to do is,

00:00:36.817 --> 00:00:38.791
let's just think about
a couple points here.

00:00:38.791 --> 00:00:41.113
Let's just make it a
little bit tangible for us.

00:00:41.113 --> 00:00:43.481
So, let me, I'll do this
in a different color.

00:00:43.481 --> 00:00:44.990
So let's think about

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:47.858
what A of t is at different times.

00:00:47.858 --> 00:00:50.087
So, this is time.

00:00:50.087 --> 00:00:53.326
This is A as a function of time.

00:00:53.326 --> 00:00:54.673
And they give us one of them.

00:00:54.673 --> 00:00:57.053
They say, "after three hours of painting,

00:00:57.053 --> 00:01:00.153
"after three hours of painting, he had 28,

00:01:00.153 --> 00:01:03.555
"28 square meters left to paint."

00:01:03.555 --> 00:01:06.086
And once again, A of t is how
much we have left to paint,

00:01:06.086 --> 00:01:08.025
not how much we have painted.

00:01:08.025 --> 00:01:09.139
So I'm gonna leave some space here

00:01:09.139 --> 00:01:10.289
for some other values,

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:11.926
maybe zero, one, two.

00:01:11.926 --> 00:01:13.516
Let's write three over here.

00:01:13.516 --> 00:01:17.974
After three hours, he had 28
square meters left to paint.

00:01:17.974 --> 00:01:18.822
We're just assuming that

00:01:18.822 --> 00:01:20.621
this is going to be in square meters,

00:01:20.621 --> 00:01:22.421
and this is in hours.

00:01:22.421 --> 00:01:24.522
Now, they tell us that he painted his room

00:01:24.522 --> 00:01:27.286
at a rate of eight square meters per hour.

00:01:27.286 --> 00:01:29.317
So let's actually back up a little bit.

00:01:29.317 --> 00:01:30.153
Let's back up.

00:01:30.153 --> 00:01:33.717
Let's say after two hours,

00:01:33.717 --> 00:01:36.817
how much would he have had left to paint?

00:01:36.817 --> 00:01:38.861
What would A of t been?

00:01:38.861 --> 00:01:40.521
Would it have been more than 28

00:01:40.521 --> 00:01:43.319
or would it have been less than 28?

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:46.384
Well, he's painting eight square meters

00:01:46.384 --> 00:01:48.253
per hour,

00:01:48.253 --> 00:01:49.751
so every hour that goes by,

00:01:49.751 --> 00:01:51.086
he's painting more,

00:01:51.086 --> 00:01:53.524
but A of t isn't how much he has painted,

00:01:53.524 --> 00:01:56.160
it's how much he has left to paint.

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.724
So he should have less to paint

00:01:59.724 --> 00:02:01.721
as time goes up.

00:02:01.721 --> 00:02:03.951
So as time goes up,

00:02:03.951 --> 00:02:08.726
as time increases, A of t should go down.

00:02:08.726 --> 00:02:11.885
So at two hours, he
should have more to paint

00:02:11.885 --> 00:02:12.988
than at three hours,

00:02:12.988 --> 00:02:13.719
because remember,

00:02:13.719 --> 00:02:15.891
A of t is how much he has left to paint.

00:02:15.891 --> 00:02:17.992
So how much more would
he have had to paint

00:02:17.992 --> 00:02:20.627
at two hours than at three hours?

00:02:20.627 --> 00:02:23.251
Well it tells us that he
has eight square meters,

00:02:23.251 --> 00:02:26.386
he paints at a rate of eight
square meters per hour.

00:02:26.386 --> 00:02:27.860
So between two and three hours,

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.217
he would've painted eight square meters.

00:02:30.217 --> 00:02:31.274
So at two hours, he would've had

00:02:31.274 --> 00:02:34.025
eight square meters more to paint.

00:02:34.025 --> 00:02:36.521
So, if you add eight to
this right over here,

00:02:36.521 --> 00:02:38.449
you would be at 36.

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:41.421
So he would've had 36
square meters to paint

00:02:41.421 --> 00:02:43.186
at two hours.

00:02:43.186 --> 00:02:45.426
And what about one hour?

00:02:45.426 --> 00:02:48.085
So at one hour, he would've
had eight more square meters

00:02:48.085 --> 00:02:48.851
to paint.

00:02:48.851 --> 00:02:53.019
So 36 plus eight, that is 44.

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:56.015
And at zero hours, what
would he have had to paint?

00:02:56.015 --> 00:02:58.186
So, let me do this another
color, at zero hours.

00:02:58.186 --> 00:03:01.483
Well he would've had to paint
eight more square meters.

00:03:01.483 --> 00:03:03.584
So 44 plus eight is 52.

00:03:03.584 --> 00:03:05.210
Let's think about
whether that makes sense.

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:06.359
If right when he was starting,

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:08.728
he had 52 square meters to paint.

00:03:08.728 --> 00:03:10.992
Then, an hour goes by,

00:03:10.992 --> 00:03:13.592
so your change in time is one hour,

00:03:13.592 --> 00:03:17.627
and then your change in how
much he has left to paint,

00:03:17.627 --> 00:03:19.925
it goes down by eight.

00:03:19.925 --> 00:03:23.548
Change in A is equal to negative eight.

00:03:23.548 --> 00:03:24.523
That makes sense.

00:03:24.523 --> 00:03:26.984
His rate of change should be negative

00:03:26.984 --> 00:03:30.421
because the amount he has
left to paint goes down

00:03:30.421 --> 00:03:32.394
as time goes forward.

00:03:32.394 --> 00:03:34.519
So this was pretty interesting.

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:35.448
Now let's see if we can actually

00:03:35.448 --> 00:03:36.992
construct a formula,

00:03:36.992 --> 00:03:40.161
or the formula that
describes this function.

00:03:40.161 --> 00:03:42.251
Well this is happening at a constant rate.

00:03:42.251 --> 00:03:44.840
Every time t goes up by one,

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.174
we see A of t goes down by eight.

00:03:47.174 --> 00:03:49.426
t goes up by one, A of
t goes down by eight.

00:03:49.426 --> 00:03:50.483
They tell us that, and that's because

00:03:50.483 --> 00:03:53.652
he paints it at a rate of
eight square meters per hour.

00:03:53.652 --> 00:03:55.591
So whenever you're describing something

00:03:55.591 --> 00:03:57.553
that's happening at a constant rate,

00:03:57.553 --> 00:04:00.711
that can be described
by a linear function.

00:04:00.711 --> 00:04:03.695
And a linear function will have the form

00:04:03.695 --> 00:04:08.420
A of t is equal to your
rate of change times time,

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:10.417
plus wherever you started,

00:04:10.417 --> 00:04:12.646
and m and b are just the
letters that people tend to use

00:04:12.646 --> 00:04:14.086
for your rate of change,

00:04:14.086 --> 00:04:16.187
your slope, if you were graphing this,

00:04:16.187 --> 00:04:17.952
and b, where you started off,

00:04:17.952 --> 00:04:19.960
and this would be your vertical intercept,

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:21.388
sometimes you call it your y-intercept,

00:04:21.388 --> 00:04:23.385
but in this case it would
be your A-intercept,

00:04:23.385 --> 00:04:26.125
if we're thinking about the actual,

00:04:26.125 --> 00:04:28.319
it would help us find the A-intercept

00:04:28.319 --> 00:04:30.618
if we were graphing this thing.

00:04:30.618 --> 00:04:33.126
But we actually already
know both of these things.

00:04:33.126 --> 00:04:35.424
We know what our rate of change is.

00:04:35.424 --> 00:04:36.620
It is negative eight.

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.362
I mean, we could say,
"well what's our slope?"

00:04:38.362 --> 00:04:42.507
Our slope is change of A over change in t.

00:04:42.507 --> 00:04:44.515
Change in A,

00:04:44.515 --> 00:04:45.757
let me write it this way,

00:04:45.757 --> 00:04:47.789
let me do it in a different
color just for fun.

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:49.623
So our,

00:04:49.623 --> 00:04:54.186
our slope is just our change

00:04:54.186 --> 00:04:57.358
in our dependent variable

00:04:57.358 --> 00:04:59.808
over our change in our
independent variable,

00:04:59.808 --> 00:05:01.688
which is equal to negative eight.

00:05:01.688 --> 00:05:02.478
They tell us that.

00:05:02.478 --> 00:05:03.952
It's equal to negative eight.

00:05:03.952 --> 00:05:06.390
So this thing is equal to negative eight,

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:09.688
and b is going to be equal to A of zero.

00:05:09.688 --> 00:05:12.149
A of zero,

00:05:12.149 --> 00:05:13.890
well when t is equal to zero,

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:15.551
this term right here goes away

00:05:15.551 --> 00:05:16.456
and you're just left with b.

00:05:16.456 --> 00:05:17.989
A of zero is equal to b.

00:05:17.989 --> 00:05:19.661
And we know what A of zero is.

00:05:19.661 --> 00:05:22.284
It is equal to 52.

00:05:22.284 --> 00:05:25.791
So we know this right over here is 52.

00:05:25.791 --> 00:05:26.824
And we're done!

00:05:26.824 --> 00:05:29.285
We know that, I'll just
rewrite it just for fun,

00:05:29.285 --> 00:05:30.957
A of t,

00:05:30.957 --> 00:05:35.322
the area that he has left to
paint as a function of time,

00:05:35.322 --> 00:05:38.619
is equal to negative eight

00:05:38.619 --> 00:05:42.141
times time,

00:05:42.141 --> 00:05:45.447
plus 52.

00:05:45.447 --> 00:05:47.387
And you can confirm that
the units make sense,

00:05:47.387 --> 00:05:49.553
because this negative eight,

00:05:49.553 --> 00:05:51.527
and actually let's let me write
it one time with the units,

00:05:51.527 --> 00:05:54.418
just 'cause it is an important
thing to think about.

00:05:54.418 --> 00:05:56.218
Area as a function of time,

00:05:56.218 --> 00:05:58.087
this is how much he has left to paint,

00:05:58.087 --> 00:06:01.830
is going to be equal to

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:05.393
negative eight

00:06:05.393 --> 00:06:08.888
square meters per hour,

00:06:08.888 --> 00:06:12.580
so negative eight meters squared per hour,

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:17.445
times t hours,

00:06:17.445 --> 00:06:19.046
maybe I'll write out "hours"

00:06:19.046 --> 00:06:20.521
so you don't think it's a variable,

00:06:20.521 --> 00:06:21.554
t hours,

00:06:21.554 --> 00:06:23.249
let me write the hours over here,

00:06:23.249 --> 00:06:28.044
t hours plus 52 square meters.

00:06:28.044 --> 00:06:32.214
Plus, let me do it right over here.

00:06:32.214 --> 00:06:35.940
Plus, I have trouble switching colors,

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:40.886
plus 52 square meters.

00:06:40.886 --> 00:06:44.255
And you see hours divided
by hours cancels out

00:06:44.255 --> 00:06:45.718
and you'll just be left
with meters squared.

00:06:45.718 --> 00:06:48.226
You'd have negative eight t square meters

00:06:48.226 --> 00:06:50.374
plus 52 square meters,

00:06:50.374 --> 00:06:52.974
and so the A of t is
going to be given to you

00:06:52.974 --> 00:06:55.587
in square meters.

00:06:55.587 --> 00:06:57.792
Now there's other ways that you might have

00:06:57.792 --> 00:06:58.791
wanted to tackle this.

00:06:58.791 --> 00:06:59.488
You might've immediately said,

00:06:59.488 --> 00:07:00.823
"Hey look, my rate of change

00:07:00.823 --> 00:07:02.820
" is eight square meters per hour."

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:03.981
But you have to be very careful there.

00:07:03.981 --> 00:07:06.024
You might've said, "Oh my rate of change,

00:07:06.024 --> 00:07:07.150
"maybe it's going to be positive

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:07.928
"eight square meters per hour."

00:07:07.928 --> 00:07:08.717
But you have to be clear

00:07:08.717 --> 00:07:10.784
that A is not how much he's painting,

00:07:10.784 --> 00:07:12.775
it's how much he has left to paint.

00:07:12.775 --> 00:07:15.352
So his rate of change of how
much he has left to paint

00:07:15.352 --> 00:07:18.220
is decreasing at eight
square meters per hour.

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:20.589
So you might've said, "Okay, immediately,

00:07:20.589 --> 00:07:23.561
"my formula would look like this:

00:07:23.561 --> 00:07:25.128
"A of t is going to to be equal to

00:07:25.128 --> 00:07:29.052
"negative eight times t plus some b."

00:07:29.052 --> 00:07:30.759
And then you could've
used this information

00:07:30.759 --> 00:07:32.106
right over here to solve for b.

00:07:32.106 --> 00:07:35.466
You say, "Hey, when t is equal to three,

00:07:35.466 --> 00:07:36.454
"A is equal to 28."

00:07:36.454 --> 00:07:37.592
You could've just used this information

00:07:37.592 --> 00:07:40.042
right over here and
substituted right over here.

00:07:40.042 --> 00:07:43.049
So when t is equal to
three, when this is three,

00:07:43.049 --> 00:07:44.686
A of t is 28.

00:07:44.686 --> 00:07:47.453
And you would've gotten 28
is equal to negative eight

00:07:47.453 --> 00:07:49.182
times three,

00:07:49.182 --> 00:07:51.845
so negative 24, plus b.

00:07:51.845 --> 00:07:54.585
And then you would've
added 24 to both sides.

00:07:54.585 --> 00:07:56.152
Whoops.

00:07:56.152 --> 00:08:00.320
You would've added 24 to both sides,

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:02.784
and you would've gotten

00:08:02.784 --> 00:08:07.568
28 plus 24 is 52.

00:08:08.168 --> 00:08:10.550
And then on the right side,
you would just have b.

00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:13.813
You would get b is equal to 52,

00:08:13.813 --> 00:08:15.693
which is exactly what we got over there.

00:08:15.693 --> 00:08:17.017
I like to do it this way

00:08:17.017 --> 00:08:19.954
just to make sure that
we really conceptualize,

00:08:19.954 --> 00:08:22.468
we really got what was going on.
