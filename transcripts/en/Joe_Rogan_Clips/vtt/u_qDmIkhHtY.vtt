1
00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:04.880
The Joe Rogan experience.
I don't know if you knew,
but I used to um,

2
00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:09.710
do tournament fighting a karate style.
Yeah.
Right.
Yeah.
Yeah.

3
00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:11.820
And the reason the,

4
00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:15.890
what discourages me or made me know that I didn't want to be a Friday,

5
00:00:15.891 --> 00:00:20.510
it's just what you described,
anxiety.
Oh yeah.
It would,

6
00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:25.250
it was paralyzing.
Paralyzing.
Yeah.
I mean,

7
00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:30.410
um,
I be frozen with it.
It's,
it's so crazy that I'm going to,

8
00:00:30.411 --> 00:00:31.041
last term,

9
00:00:31.041 --> 00:00:35.690
I was an ed Parker's a international karate championships in Long Beach,

10
00:00:35.691 --> 00:00:37.790
California.
And,

11
00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.750
and then he would fight until my feet were stuck and I was a taekwondo black

12
00:00:45.351 --> 00:00:50.330
belt,
but my feet were frozen to the fucking man.
I couldn't lift them.

13
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.780
My next way to thousand pounds eats me.

14
00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.580
And I was so paranoid because all these people,

15
00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.890
it was people were around and I was so afraid that I was going to do something

16
00:01:00.891 --> 00:01:05.180
to embarrass myself.
And I'm like,
oh my God,

17
00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:07.730
everybody's looking and you know,
I'll sit plenty.

18
00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.500
Max is going on at the same time.

19
00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.740
But it felt like everybody was looking at me and I'm like,
man,

20
00:01:13.741 --> 00:01:17.060
you to watch me through something.
My techniques could be wrong.

21
00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:19.880
I'm just going to fuck up in front.

22
00:01:19.881 --> 00:01:24.050
End of the fear was paralyzing him.
Like,
you know,

23
00:01:24.051 --> 00:01:28.100
I can't fucking do this.
I'm not cut out to be a fighter man.
I just can't,

24
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.840
the pressure just kicked my ass.

25
00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.550
<v 1>It's a,
it's a hard thing to overcome.
Oh Man.</v>

26
00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:35.560
It's hard to sort your way through it.

27
00:01:35.561 --> 00:01:38.830
And it was really hard for a lot of fighters is coming back from a loss.

28
00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.570
They get beat up and smashed and then then they have to come back and figure out

29
00:01:43.571 --> 00:01:45.800
a way through,
you know,
and um,

30
00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.640
<v 0>I see a devastating loss.
Of course she sees him yet,
but devastating.</v>

31
00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:54.190
<v 1>No,
Raymond Daniels is,
oh,
of course they go.
Did you see his fight?
This,</v>

32
00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:00.050
do you see that seven 20 degree punch Kokoda bellatore that find that clip,

33
00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.140
man,
I let,
we won't be able to show it.
Right.
I can show you guys.

34
00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.920
Just show us for folks who don't know what the Ro,

35
00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.320
one of the reasons I brought up Raymond Daniels is Raymond Daniels.
Oh,

36
00:02:11.321 --> 00:02:13.000
he's a belt or kickboxing champion.

37
00:02:13.001 --> 00:02:17.590
Now he lost in devastating fashion to Nikki hold skin,

38
00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.490
who's a,
another world champion.
And also to Joel to Valtellina,

39
00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:22.600
who's another world champion.

40
00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.250
So when he was making the transition from karate champion to kickboxing
champion,

41
00:02:27.251 --> 00:02:30.640
he had some stumbling,
didn't,
didn't go 100% smooth,

42
00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:32.770
but that guy has got an iron will

43
00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.620
<v 0>man,
um,</v>

44
00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.900
stunt coordinators and move here.
This,
watch this.

45
00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.150
Look at Ray Mactan,
Raymond Daniels.

46
00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.790
<v 1>Wow.
That's fucking,
that's fucking crazy.</v>

47
00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.090
He went for a three 60 roundhouse kick.
Dude wasn't there.

48
00:02:50.091 --> 00:02:54.080
And then he continued to spin further and boom.
I mean,

49
00:02:54.081 --> 00:02:58.910
that is insane.
That is such an insane,
the land,
a punch at the end of,

50
00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:00.850
I mean,
it is so bananas.

51
00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:04.390
And he landed a spinning back kick to the body right before he did that too.

52
00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:09.400
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean,
he did a thing,
find the thing he did in,
um,

53
00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:13.790
in,
in glory.
He did a jumping sidekicks,

54
00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.300
spinning back kick combination where he touched them.

55
00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.740
He touched him with the front leg and then spun in the air and spinning back

56
00:03:20.741 --> 00:03:23.740
kick area is right here.
Yeah.
I mean,

57
00:03:23.741 --> 00:03:28.050
this is fucking crazy.
He,
oh here,

58
00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:32.440
watch,
watch how he does.
Let,
let this go.
Here it goes,
watch he touches it.

59
00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.950
<v 0>[inaudible] be shit and to do worldclass kickbox you're like,</v>

60
00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:40.420
that's what I'm saying.
I mean the,

61
00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.960
the move started quarterlies are looking at his highlights.

62
00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:47.050
You go to come up with,
you know,
fight free,

63
00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:52.280
eat their stuff that they don't even do in the movies in a real fight.
Yeah.

64
00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:55.980
Yeah.
He's hard to handle.
He,
he,

65
00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:01.110
I gave her a pep talk or speak them to a group of fighters and he was in the

66
00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.260
group that came out here.
I got frank after me.
I'm like,
man,
I don't know.
Oh,

67
00:04:06.261 --> 00:04:11.190
it's a fan.
A fan boy.
Big Term Motherfucker.

68
00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.810
I love

69
00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:13.860
<v 1>watching those guys.</v>

70
00:04:13.861 --> 00:04:17.910
And like guys like Michael Van and Paige was another one who has those karate

71
00:04:17.911 --> 00:04:22.260
skills,
but then they're learning all the skills of MMA and then you see,

72
00:04:22.261 --> 00:04:25.890
look man,
if you don't know that karate style and he knows MMA,

73
00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:29.580
like you're kind of fucked because they do shit that's like outlandish.
