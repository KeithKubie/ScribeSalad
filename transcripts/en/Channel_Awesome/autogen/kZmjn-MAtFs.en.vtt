00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:29.600 align:start position:0%
just to overkill yeah and again I think

just to overkill yeah and again I think
because<00:03:29.870><c> really</c><00:03:30.650><c> cuz</c><00:03:30.859><c> the</c><00:03:31.010><c> writing</c><00:03:31.489><c> is</c><00:03:31.670><c> so</c>

like what we said in the last one where
 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.210 align:start position:0%
like what we said in the last one where
I<00:03:34.940><c> was</c><00:03:35.090><c> like</c><00:03:35.299><c> that</c><00:03:35.810><c> face</c><00:03:36.230><c> he</c><00:03:36.470><c> gave</c><00:03:36.680><c> when</c><00:03:36.890><c> he</c><00:03:36.950><c> saw</c>

I was like that face he gave when he saw
 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.160 align:start position:0%
I was like that face he gave when he saw

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 align:start position:0%
the body of the old woman it's like we
 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:40.810 align:start position:0%
the body of the old woman it's like we

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:40.820 align:start position:0%
got in that hit us so hard it's like
 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:42.039 align:start position:0%
got in that hit us so hard it's like
that's<00:03:41.000><c> enough</c><00:03:41.329><c> and</c><00:03:41.450><c> then</c><00:03:41.630><c> when</c><00:03:41.750><c> you</c><00:03:41.810><c> can't</c>

00:03:42.039 --> 00:03:42.049 align:start position:0%
that's enough and then when you can't
 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:42.849 align:start position:0%
that's enough and then when you can't
keep<00:03:42.170><c> going</c><00:03:42.380><c> with</c><00:03:42.680><c> it</c>

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:42.859 align:start position:0%
keep going with it
 

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:45.009 align:start position:0%
keep going with it
exactly<00:03:43.670><c> that's</c><00:03:43.790><c> overkill</c><00:03:44.299><c> on</c><00:03:44.359><c> this</c><00:03:44.630><c> one</c><00:03:44.840><c> it's</c>

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:45.019 align:start position:0%
exactly that's overkill on this one it's
 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:47.140 align:start position:0%
exactly that's overkill on this one it's

good<00:11:14.720><c> yeah</c><00:11:15.350><c> that's</c><00:11:15.590><c> part</c><00:11:15.860><c> of</c><00:11:15.950><c> it</c><00:11:16.070><c> so</c><00:11:16.490><c> um</c><00:11:16.930><c> so</c>

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:17.930 align:start position:0%
good yeah that's part of it so um so
 

00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:20.320 align:start position:0%
good yeah that's part of it so um so
yeah<00:11:18.170><c> I</c><00:11:18.200><c> mean</c><00:11:18.530><c> it</c><00:11:18.590><c> again</c><00:11:19.220><c> it's</c><00:11:19.430><c> I</c><00:11:19.670><c> would</c><00:11:20.210><c> say</c>

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:20.330 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean it again it's I would say
 

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:22.420 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean it again it's I would say
this<00:11:20.480><c> is</c><00:11:20.660><c> necessarily</c><00:11:21.140><c> nitpicking</c><00:11:21.710><c> as</c><00:11:22.040><c> if</c><00:11:22.250><c> it</c>

00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:22.430 align:start position:0%
this is necessarily nitpicking as if it
 

00:11:22.430 --> 00:11:24.490 align:start position:0%
this is necessarily nitpicking as if it
was<00:11:22.760><c> slow</c><00:11:23.120><c> and</c><00:11:23.150><c> I</c><00:11:23.540><c> think</c><00:11:23.810><c> people</c><00:11:24.080><c> that</c><00:11:24.230><c> want</c><00:11:24.410><c> to</c>

00:11:24.490 --> 00:11:24.500 align:start position:0%
was slow and I think people that want to
 

00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:25.780 align:start position:0%
was slow and I think people that want to
would<00:11:24.650><c> probably</c><00:11:24.890><c> say</c><00:11:24.980><c> yeah</c><00:11:25.190><c> this</c><00:11:25.430><c> did</c><00:11:25.610><c> feel</c>

00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:25.790 align:start position:0%
would probably say yeah this did feel
 

00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:28.510 align:start position:0%
would probably say yeah this did feel
kind<00:11:26.060><c> of</c><00:11:26.120><c> slow</c><00:11:26.300><c> and</c><00:11:26.450><c> then</c><00:11:26.630><c> I</c><00:11:26.780><c> I</c><00:11:26.840><c> have</c><00:11:27.440><c> no</c><00:11:27.590><c> idea</c><00:11:27.980><c> I</c>

00:11:28.510 --> 00:11:28.520 align:start position:0%
kind of slow and then I I have no idea I
 

00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:30.490 align:start position:0%
kind of slow and then I I have no idea I
haven't<00:11:28.850><c> read</c><00:11:29.060><c> any</c><00:11:29.360><c> reviews</c><00:11:29.450><c> of</c><00:11:30.230><c> the</c><00:11:30.320><c> show</c>

00:11:30.490 --> 00:11:30.500 align:start position:0%

00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:32.750 align:start position:0%
episode by episode so I don't know what
 

00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:35.380 align:start position:0%
episode by episode so I don't know what
audience<00:11:33.110><c> reaction</c><00:11:33.590><c> was</c><00:11:33.740><c> to</c><00:11:33.890><c> this</c><00:11:34.040><c> man</c><00:11:34.910><c> I</c><00:11:35.090><c> mean</c>

00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:35.390 align:start position:0%
audience reaction was to this man I mean
 

00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:38.200 align:start position:0%
audience reaction was to this man I mean
all<00:11:35.720><c> I</c><00:11:36.410><c> can</c><00:11:36.560><c> say</c><00:11:36.890><c> is</c><00:11:37.010><c> that</c><00:11:37.160><c> yeah</c><00:11:37.490><c> I</c><00:11:37.520><c> don't</c><00:11:38.000><c> even</c>

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:38.210 align:start position:0%
all I can say is that yeah I don't even
 

00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:40.240 align:start position:0%
all I can say is that yeah I don't even
think<00:11:38.360><c> it's</c><00:11:38.570><c> nitpicky</c><00:11:39.020><c> I</c><00:11:39.050><c> think</c><00:11:39.740><c> honestly</c><00:11:40.070><c> it</c>

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:40.250 align:start position:0%
think it's nitpicky I think honestly it
 

00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:43.930 align:start position:0%
think it's nitpicky I think honestly it
was<00:11:40.400><c> a</c><00:11:40.430><c> weak</c><00:11:41.680><c> section</c><00:11:42.680><c> of</c><00:11:42.860><c> this</c><00:11:43.070><c> episode</c><00:11:43.670><c> and</c>

00:11:43.930 --> 00:11:43.940 align:start position:0%
was a weak section of this episode and
 

00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:45.730 align:start position:0%
was a weak section of this episode and
I'm<00:11:44.060><c> kind</c><00:11:44.360><c> of</c><00:11:44.420><c> the</c><00:11:44.540><c> show</c><00:11:44.720><c> altogether</c><00:11:45.320><c> like</c><00:11:45.560><c> I</c>

00:11:45.730 --> 00:11:45.740 align:start position:0%
I'm kind of the show altogether like I
 

00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:47.440 align:start position:0%
I'm kind of the show altogether like I
kind<00:11:46.130><c> of</c><00:11:46.220><c> want</c><00:11:46.280><c> a</c><00:11:46.490><c> rewrite</c><00:11:46.880><c> of</c><00:11:46.910><c> it</c><00:11:47.090><c> because</c><00:11:47.300><c> I'm</c>

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:47.450 align:start position:0%
kind of want a rewrite of it because I'm
 

00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:48.520 align:start position:0%
kind of want a rewrite of it because I'm
like<00:11:47.600><c> to</c><00:11:47.720><c> me</c><00:11:47.810><c> it</c><00:11:47.930><c> should</c><00:11:48.110><c> be</c><00:11:48.230><c> a</c><00:11:48.260><c> scene</c><00:11:48.500><c> that</c>

00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:48.530 align:start position:0%
like to me it should be a scene that
 

00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:49.990 align:start position:0%
like to me it should be a scene that
really<00:11:48.650><c> resonates</c><00:11:49.340><c> with</c><00:11:49.430><c> me</c><00:11:49.670><c> and</c><00:11:49.850><c> it</c>

00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
really resonates with me and it
 

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.450 align:start position:0%
really resonates with me and it
strangely<00:11:50.420><c> enough</c><00:11:50.690><c> didn't</c><00:11:51.200><c> yeah</c><00:11:51.620><c> but</c><00:11:52.100><c> I</c><00:11:52.130><c> mean</c>

00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:07.820 align:start position:0%
length that most normal shows would do
 

00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:09.970 align:start position:0%
length that most normal shows would do
it<00:12:08.000><c> but</c><00:12:08.210><c> you</c><00:12:08.420><c> get</c><00:12:08.600><c> the</c><00:12:08.780><c> picture</c><00:12:08.930><c> so</c><00:12:09.350><c> quickly</c>

00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:12.350 align:start position:0%
and so well that when you do it the
 

00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:14.110 align:start position:0%
and so well that when you do it the
normal<00:12:12.440><c> mouths</c><00:12:12.800><c> like</c><00:12:12.890><c> no</c><00:12:13.040><c> no</c><00:12:13.250><c> we</c><00:12:13.430><c> we</c><00:12:13.730><c> get</c><00:12:13.970><c> it</c>

00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:18.950 align:start position:0%
repeat so like I said I think and what
 

00:12:18.950 --> 00:12:20.680 align:start position:0%
repeat so like I said I think and what
we're<00:12:19.130><c> feeling</c><00:12:19.340><c> it's</c><00:12:19.820><c> like</c><00:12:19.880><c> we</c><00:12:20.060><c> already</c><00:12:20.240><c> feel</c>

00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:20.690 align:start position:0%
we're feeling it's like we already feel
 

00:12:20.690 --> 00:12:22.810 align:start position:0%
we're feeling it's like we already feel
it<00:12:20.720><c> and</c><00:12:21.080><c> they're</c><00:12:21.440><c> trying</c><00:12:21.830><c> to</c><00:12:21.890><c> emphasize</c><00:12:22.610><c> it</c>

00:12:22.810 --> 00:12:22.820 align:start position:0%
it and they're trying to emphasize it
 

00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:25.000 align:start position:0%
it and they're trying to emphasize it
even<00:12:23.120><c> more</c><00:12:23.330><c> and</c><00:12:23.630><c> it's</c><00:12:23.960><c> not</c><00:12:24.170><c> needed</c><00:12:24.560><c> so</c><00:12:24.800><c> it's</c>

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:25.010 align:start position:0%
even more and it's not needed so it's
 

00:12:25.010 --> 00:12:25.870 align:start position:0%
even more and it's not needed so it's
one<00:12:25.100><c> of</c><00:12:25.160><c> those</c><00:12:25.220><c> things</c><00:12:25.430><c> where</c><00:12:25.580><c> it's</c><00:12:25.700><c> like</c><00:12:25.730><c> I</c>

00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:25.880 align:start position:0%
one of those things where it's like I
 

00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:28.030 align:start position:0%
one of those things where it's like I
think<00:12:26.030><c> I</c><00:12:26.240><c> just</c><00:12:26.810><c> did</c><00:12:26.930><c> their</c><00:12:27.080><c> job</c><00:12:27.260><c> too</c><00:12:27.410><c> well</c><00:12:27.440><c> you</c>

00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:28.040 align:start position:0%
think I just did their job too well you
