Now, one way to draw a whole bunch of squares,

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:05.420
is to start by drawing just the one square. So,

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:07.250
here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to step away from

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:10.600
my computer for a little bit. Put this hat on.

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.510
And I will draw on this red carpet, which will be my canvas. So, when

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:21.970
I move around on it, you will notice that I can draw. There it is.

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.240
And in this case, I drew a triangle. So, here's

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.130
a task for you. If you were ask me to draw

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.630
a square on this red carpet, what step by step instructions

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:37.380
would you give me? Write your answers in the box provided.
