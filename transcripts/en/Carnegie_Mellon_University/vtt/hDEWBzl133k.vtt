00:00:02.709 --> 00:00:06.444
One,
&gt;&gt; Two, three, three.

00:00:06.444 --> 00:00:10.676
[APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; And

00:00:10.676 --> 00:00:15.607
with that, three years of construction and
anticipation are over.

00:00:15.607 --> 00:00:20.035
The David A. Tepper Quadrangle,
a 315,000 square foot building,

00:00:20.035 --> 00:00:22.394
the largest building on campus is open.

00:00:22.394 --> 00:00:24.847
And Tepper himself was here for
the ceremonies.

00:00:24.847 --> 00:00:27.046
&gt;&gt; Well this place is fantastic.

00:00:27.046 --> 00:00:29.899
So, I tell you not too bad,
not too bad at all.

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:33.054
[APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; Quad is much more than a new home for

00:00:33.054 --> 00:00:36.395
the Temper School of Business,
it's the campus hub.

00:00:36.395 --> 00:00:39.664
A space that represents
a unique model of education.

00:00:39.664 --> 00:00:42.562
It's based on bringing
all students together.

00:00:42.562 --> 00:00:45.084
&gt;&gt; Nowhere is the potential for

00:00:45.084 --> 00:00:51.120
what's next more palpable then
right here in the Tepper Quad.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.000
&gt;&gt; Five years ago,
we really came together with this vision

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.320
of doing a business school which
was just not a business school.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.740
A business school that was just more than
a silo where you'd be in a corner of

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:08.050
campus and just do business education,

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.580
but a place where you really
would have people come.

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.550
&gt;&gt; With the needs of business and the
needs of the world really now converging

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:21.550
on the strength of Carnegie Mellon and
the Tepper School.

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:28.000
I think we are uniquely positioned to
provide the intellectual leadership and

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.020
to educate the next generation of
business leaders and entrepeneurs.

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.280
&gt;&gt; It's very much about bringing
together innovation with

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.780
business models to launch new
businesses and launch new innovations.

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.922
And through the interaction in this space,
we'll be able to stand up new concepts,

00:01:45.922 --> 00:01:50.432
commercialize new businesses,
it's quintessential CMU.

00:01:51.501 --> 00:01:55.342
&gt;&gt; Tepper Quad also include the 2,200
square foot Rohr Commons where you can

00:01:55.342 --> 00:01:56.700
get a bite to eat.

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.090
Student will study modern languages and

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.805
digital humanities in the Askwith Kenner
Global Languages and Cultures Room.

00:02:03.805 --> 00:02:08.487
Corner stone of the first floor is
the David and Susan Coulter Welcome Center.

00:02:08.487 --> 00:02:11.642
This is where CMU visitors can sign up for
a campus tour and

00:02:11.642 --> 00:02:14.946
meet with admissions officials and
student ambassadors.

00:02:14.946 --> 00:02:19.096
&gt;&gt; That is to divide
the conference room into two.

00:02:19.096 --> 00:02:23.208
&gt;&gt; Next door to that is the 600
seat Simmons Auditorium.

00:02:23.208 --> 00:02:26.103
It's the largest gathering spot on campus.

00:02:26.103 --> 00:02:30.144
You can find the Tepper Quad out here
along Forbes Avenue on the other side of

00:02:30.144 --> 00:02:32.079
the street from the rest of campus.

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:33.736
This used to be a parking lot.

00:02:33.736 --> 00:02:37.814
And now, it's the shiny new home of
the nation's sixth ranked undergraduate

00:02:37.814 --> 00:02:38.878
business program.

00:02:38.878 --> 00:02:42.439
