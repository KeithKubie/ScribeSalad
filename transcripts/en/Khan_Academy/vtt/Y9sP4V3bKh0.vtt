00:00:00.256 --> 00:00:01.565
- [Voiceover] So we have the graph

00:00:01.565 --> 00:00:04.676
of y equal f of x right over here,

00:00:04.676 --> 00:00:06.170
and what we want to do is figure out

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:10.273
the limit of f of x as x
approaches negative four.

00:00:10.273 --> 00:00:12.132
So what does that mean?

00:00:12.132 --> 00:00:16.778
Well, a limit is saying, "What
does my function approach

00:00:16.778 --> 00:00:19.378
"as the input of that function approaches,

00:00:19.378 --> 00:00:20.817
"in this case, negative four?

00:00:20.817 --> 00:00:23.175
"As the input approaches a value?"

00:00:23.175 --> 00:00:24.436
And as we see in this example,

00:00:24.436 --> 00:00:25.450
the function doesn't necessarily

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:27.796
have to be even defined at that value.

00:00:27.796 --> 00:00:30.067
We can see f of negative four,

00:00:30.067 --> 00:00:32.416
you go to x equals negative four,

00:00:32.416 --> 00:00:35.955
and you see that f of
negative four is undefined.

00:00:35.955 --> 00:00:38.756
So this is not defined, but as we'll see

00:00:38.756 --> 00:00:40.810
even though the function
isn't defined there,

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:43.476
the limit might be defined there.

00:00:43.476 --> 00:00:45.264
And actually it can go
the other way around.

00:00:45.264 --> 00:00:48.252
Sometimes a function is defined there,

00:00:48.252 --> 00:00:52.381
but the limit is not, and we'll
see that in future videos.

00:00:52.381 --> 00:00:53.923
But let's just get an understanding here.

00:00:53.923 --> 00:00:57.072
What's going on as x
approaches negative four?

00:00:57.072 --> 00:00:59.204
As x approaches negative four

00:00:59.204 --> 00:01:01.580
from values greater than negative four

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.785
and from values less than negative four.

00:01:04.785 --> 00:01:05.880
Well let's first think about values

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.455
greater than negative four.

00:01:07.455 --> 00:01:11.482
So when x is negative one,
this is f of negative one.

00:01:11.482 --> 00:01:15.760
This is f of negative two,
this is f of negative three.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.927
This is f of negative 3.5,

00:01:20.218 --> 00:01:22.737
this is f of negative 3.9,

00:01:22.737 --> 00:01:27.451
this is f of negative 3.99,
this is f of negative 3.99999.

00:01:27.451 --> 00:01:29.874
And so you can see the
value of our function,

00:01:29.874 --> 00:01:32.528
as x gets closer and
closer to negative four

00:01:32.528 --> 00:01:34.065
from values greater than negative four,

00:01:34.065 --> 00:01:36.398
seems to be approaching six.

00:01:37.522 --> 00:01:39.077
And let's see if that's true
from the other direction,

00:01:39.077 --> 00:01:41.848
so from values less than negative four.

00:01:41.848 --> 00:01:45.765
So this f of negative
seven, f of negative six.

00:01:46.925 --> 00:01:51.008
This is f of negative
five, puts us around seven.

00:01:52.448 --> 00:01:56.198
This is f of negative
4.5, f of negative 4.1,

00:01:58.767 --> 00:02:00.350
f of negative 4.01,

00:02:01.492 --> 00:02:03.325
f of negative 4.00001,

00:02:05.822 --> 00:02:06.952
it looks like it's getting awfully,

00:02:06.952 --> 00:02:08.422
it's going to be a
little bit more than six,

00:02:08.422 --> 00:02:11.432
so it seems as we get closer and closer

00:02:11.432 --> 00:02:14.062
to x equal negative four, the value

00:02:14.062 --> 00:02:17.729
of our function is
approaching positive six.
