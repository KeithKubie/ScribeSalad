Humans are social creatures. We live together
in cities and crave being close to one another.

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.750
But is being social actually good for our
health?

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:14.059
Hey guys, Amy here on DNews.

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:18.340
Some not great news for single folk. According
to a 2002 review in the American Journal of

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:23.660
Sociology, uncoupled people have higher levels
of depression, anxiety, mood disorders, adjustment

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:28.680
problems, and demonstrate suicidal behaviour
more frequently than their coupled counterparts.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.669
And it’s not just from crippling loneliness
that comes with spending night after night

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.829
on the couch with a growing number of cats.
Coupled people really do have a health advantage.

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:43.520
Like less pain. A 2010 study published in
PLoS ONE found that feelings of euphoria associated

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.360
with romantic love active the brain’s reward
system and reduces physical thermal pain.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.440
The study had love-struck participants less
than nine months into a new relationship hold

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.940
a heat block. They were then asked to complete
three tasks: look at pictures of their significant

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.460
other, look at pictures of equally attractive
strangers, and complete a word-association

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.229
distraction task that has been shown to reduce
pain. Participants reported less pain with

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:10.680
both the partner pictures and the distraction
test, but only the partner pictures activated

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.479
areas of the brain associated with reward
systems suggesting love really is a drug-free

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:16.479
pain remedy.

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:19.610
Being in love — especially when you're nuts
about someone in the early phases of a relationship

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.229
— releases hormones in the brain that actually
make you happier. According to a 2010 study

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:28.610
by the University of Chicago and Northwestern
University, brains in relationships produce

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.560
cortisol, a stress hormone that regulates
and moderates the effects of stress on the

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.650
body. Romantic love also activates dopamine-rich
areas in the brain according to a 2005 study

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.560
in the Journal of Neurophysiology. These are
the parts of the brain associated with reward,

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.689
desire, addiction and euphoric states, so
basically all those things that make you feel

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:46.689
amazing.

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:50.979
Which is just a great thing overall. A 2000
study by the U.S. Bureau of the Census, found

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:55.049
that people in long-term relationships simply
live longer, and that’s even when adjusted

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.600
for socioeconomic factors.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:57.600
So, great!

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.799
But kinda depressing for singles… good thing
friendships are also really important!

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.850
Our social inclinations mean that we support
each other in living the best lives we can,

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.220
helping us stick with healthy diets, encouraging
us to follow exercise routines, and also promoting

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.220
vital relaxation by just spending social time
together.

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.890
There have been dozens of studies that say
satisfying relationships with family and friends

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.700
have similar health benefits to being in love.
Strong friendships have been found to relieve

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.379
stress, which in turn contributes to healthy
coronary arteries, gut function, insulin regulation,

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:29.310
and immune system. Having a network of important
relationships can also make a difference in

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.010
the elderly, reducing the risk of dementia
in people over 75.

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.090
Like everything in our lives, the quality
of these relationships matter. The most positive,

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.849
healthy relationships and friendships will
have the best benefits for our health while

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:44.860
toxic friendships with negative people will
have the reverse effect. Some research has

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.300
even found that couples going through big
fights have lowered immune systems.

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.769
And it’s not just preventative medicine
that relationships are good for. People with

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:56.220
strong relationships are 50% more likely to
survive a life-threatening illness than people

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.489
with weaker ones. There’s nothing wrong
with leaning on friends if you’re going

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:02.250
through rough times. It might save your life.

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.830
So taking time to invest and maintain the
best relationships in your life isn’t just

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:09.480
good for your social life, it’s good for
your health for the rest of your life.

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.720
And if you’re thinking of letting that special
loved one know just how much you appreciate

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.250
how much they make your whole life better,
remember that Kay Jewelers is the number one

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:17.700
jewelry store in America.

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:18.709
So real friends are great!

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:22.450
But it turns out, Internet-friends are pretty
good for your health, too. We explore those

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.140
relationships a little more in this video
right here.

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.150
We’ll put a link in the description for
those of you on mobile.
