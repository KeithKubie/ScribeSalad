&gt;&gt; Eric Hoplin: I'd
like to welcome everyone

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:05.320
to this exciting session, this
author's series here today

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:07.240
with Stuart Eizenstat.

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.570
My name is Eric Hoplin.

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:11.560
I'm the head of the External
Relations at Wells Fargo.

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.350
And I'm really honored
to be here today in part

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:15.570
because I brought
my three young boys.

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.310
They're so excited
for this session.

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.490
They're so excited to meet
authors and to celebrate reading

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.390
and to celebrate literacy.

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.580
You know, at Wells Fargo,
we find, we think literacy

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.850
and education and
reading is so important.

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:30.360
In fact, they're the building
blocks of a successful

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.340
and an enriching life.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.000
And that's why we're proud,
once again, for the eighth year

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.900
in a row, to be the
charter sponsor

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.810
of the National Book Festival.

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:41.560
In fact, we focus on reading
all throughout the year.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:45.410
Last year, Wells Fargo, we
gave out more than 57,000 books

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:46.710
and our team members read

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.330
to 104,000 children
all around the country.

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.910
Now, I have to tell you, if
you're looking for fun things

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:54.910
to do at the National
Book Festival today,

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:56.950
after this session,
I would suggest

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:59.380
to go all the way
downstairs to the basement

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:01.940
to the America Reads
Pavilion and there,

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:03.940
there are Wells Fargo
volunteers that are going

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.560
to host great activities
for the entire family.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.590
In fact, my boys and I, we just
did a horse bouncy racing game.

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:11.890
They beat me.

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:13.300
They're a little younger than I
am, a little faster than I am.

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.710
It's so much fun but
we've got great authors

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:17.010
that are reading to children.

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:18.530
We have an audio book section,

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.990
arts and crafts,
and so much more.

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:22.830
So come on down to
that pavilion.

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.280
But without further
ado, I'm very excited

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:26.920
to introduce this panel.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.060
Wells Fargo is so excited to
be a part of this program.

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.360
And of course, I want to turn it

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.270
over to our moderator
this morning.

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.570
He's the Co-chairman of
the National Book Festival

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.530
and of course, we all know the
incomparable David Rubinstein.

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:39.830
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubinstein: Thank
you very much [applause].

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.460
So thank you very much.

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.960
So how many people, how
many people here lived

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.680
through the Washington
DC in the Carter years?

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:49.980
How many people were
living in Washington?

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.810
Okay. How many people worked
in the Carter administration?

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.540
Okay. How many people
have met Jimmy Carter?

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.420
Okay. Well, we have a
terrific person to talk

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.020
about the Carter administration,
the Carter White House,

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:03.890
and Jimmy Carter
and my former boss.

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.490
I was one of his deputies
at the White House

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:06.790
with Stuart Eizenstat.

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:08.740
Let me give Stuart an
introduction before we talk

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:10.820
about his book which
has come out now.

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:13.250
It's <i>President Carter,
the White House Years </i>.

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.690
And I highly recommend
it to people.

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.240
Let me talk about
Stuart's background.

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.980
Stuart is a native of Atlanta,
went to Grady High School

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.950
where he was an All-American
basketball player.

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.810
Yes, that's true,
All-American basketball player.

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.790
He then went to University
of North Carolina

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.750
where he did not play
basketball but he tried

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.470
out in the freshman year
and concluded he'd be better

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.180
as an academic performer.

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.430
And he graduated Phi Beta Kappa.

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.570
He then went to Harvard
Law School and from there,

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:41.860
he later came into the Johnson
White House and worked there

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.400
for President Johnson.

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.710
And then in 1968, campaigned
for Hubert Humphrey.

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:49.180
He then went back to
Atlanta, practiced law there.

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.650
Became a partner in a firm
called Hall Goldstein.

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.410
And then he got to know somebody
who was running for governor

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.190
of Georgia named Jimmy Carter.

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.520
He got involved in helping
him in that election campaign

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.850
and then later, he got involved
with helping Jimmy Carter

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.890
in his 1976 campaign for
president of the United States.

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:06.330
And he was his principal
policy adviser.

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.110
And then he was the principal
domestic policy adviser during

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:11.090
the four years at
the White House.

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.220
Since that time, Stuart has
served in government as well,

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.520
in the Clinton administration,

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.690
serving as initially
our Ambassador

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:22.140
to the European Union, later as
the Undersecretary of Commerce

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.050
for International Trade.

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:25.870
Later then, as the
Undersecretary

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.750
of Economic Affairs at the
State Department and then later,

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.020
as Deputy Secretary of Treasury.

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:35.240
During the Obama administration,
he served in an ex-officio role

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:40.460
as a person who helped deal with
a Holocaust asset collection

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:43.370
and has done incredible work
in making certain that people

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:44.670
who had assets taken away

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.360
from them during the Holocaust
have them given back to them,

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:48.660
to the rightful owners.

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.410
Stuart is the father of two
sons and the grandfather

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:53.790
of eight grandchildren.

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.090
Is that right?

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:56.800
And he has written
several other books

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.820
but let's focus today
on this one.

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:02.270
So Stuart, thank you
very much for coming.

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:06.390
The Carter administration
ended roughly 40 years ago.

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:09.230
So why did you wait almost
40 years to write this book

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:13.000
about President Carter and how
did you have the time to do it?

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.210
You have a job as a
partner in a law firm.

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:17.150
You've been practicing law for
a number of years in Washington

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:18.450
as well in Covington
and Burling.

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:21.600
How did you have time to do
this and was it a labor of love

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.190
or was it difficult
going back through some

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.540
of the difficult times
of the Carter years?

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:26.840
&gt;&gt; Stuart Eizenstat:
It was a labor of love.

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.880
As you remember very well
and painfully, in 1980,

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.440
President Carter suffered
the greatest political defeat

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.490
of any incumbent
president in modern times.

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:40.130
And since then and up until
the time of the publication

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:42.990
of this book, that
meant for many people

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:44.770
that he had a failed presidency.

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:48.620
And I decided it was time
to write a reassessment

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:52.010
of the Carter presidency,
warts and all.

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:56.470
It's honest and candid about the
mistakes but it also recognizes,

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:59.500
in my opinion, that he
was the most accomplished

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.660
and under-appreciated one-term
president in American history.

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:04.510
Seventy percent of our
legislation passed.

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:09.610
[ Applause ]

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:11.610
And Walter Mondale,
his vice-president,

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:14.340
put it very succinctly.

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:15.640
We told the truth.

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:17.590
We obeyed the law and
we kept the peace.

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:20.430
But there's so much more
than that, okay [applause].

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:23.970
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubinstein: Well,
let me ask you about this.

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:27.100
By the way, was this
an authorized book

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:28.500
that Jimmy Carter
asked you to do this?

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:29.800
&gt;&gt; Stuart Eizenstat:

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.100
It is absolutely not
an authorized book.

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:36.600
I've conducted 350
interviews, five times with him

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:40.060
from 1991 through 2013.

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:42.390
I interviewed people who
were positive and negative,

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:44.970
who were detractors
and supporters.

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:47.710
And I have and I think
the authenticity, David,

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:51.330
of the book depends not only on
these interviews but the fact

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:56.060
that I kept over 5000 pages
of contemporaneous notes

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:59.380
on 103 legal pads
of verbatim notes

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:02.120
of everything I saw and I heard.

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:04.720
And I called it as
it was and I told him

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:06.260
when I started writing
this book,

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.470
I was going to do
it warts and all.

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:10.440
And if I didn't do that,

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:12.900
then the positive aspects
would be discounted

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:15.160
and I think he understood this.

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:17.990
He maybe shirks a little
bit at some of the warts

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:21.300
but I think he overall has been
very supportive of the book

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:24.850
and recognizes that it does
give a new reassessment

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:26.150
of the Carter presidency.

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:30.860
And interestingly, David, his
political hero was Harry Truman.

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:33.580
And he took his famous
slogan, "The buck stops here,"

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:36.420
and put it on his
Oval Office desk.

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:39.870
Both left the White
House highly unpopular.

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:42.850
Truman is now remembered
more for his achievements

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:47.230
than his failures and I hope my
book will have a similar impact

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:51.710
on Carter as president, not just
as an admired former president.

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:53.010
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubinstein:
Usually, people who work

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:55.990
in White House staffs, they
write one of two types of books.

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:59.430
They are, "I'm great but
the president wasn't great,"

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:03.570
or [laughter] "I'm great and
the president was great."

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:05.640
But you wrote one that
says, "I'm just pretty good

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:08.310
but not perfect," and
about Carter, you said,

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:09.680
"He was pretty good
but not perfect."

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:12.140
So when you had to
relive your mistakes

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:14.660
and relive his mistakes,
was that painful?

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:17.010
&gt;&gt; Stuart Eizenstat: It
was painful but I wanted it

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:19.620
to be an honest book and
I did not decide the name

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:22.520
of this book, if they had only
listened to me [laughter].

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:27.440
Now I could have said because
David was my immediate deputy

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:29.650
before he was the
David Rubinstein.

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:33.770
And I could have said that
all of the successes were due

00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:35.070
to your recommendations.

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:36.370
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubinstein: Right.

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:37.670
&gt;&gt; Stuart Eizenstat: So
the failures, to mine.

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:38.970
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubinstein:
Hardly the case.

00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:40.270
&gt;&gt; Stuart Eizenstat: But I've
decided not to do that as well.

00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:41.580
You know, I mean, it is a book

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:44.480
which is honest about
my mistakes.

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:48.510
I didn't, for example, catch
inflation early enough.

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:50.530
I didn't give him
the right advice

00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:52.310
when Burt Lance was declining.

00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:56.470
There were a number of things
that I made mistakes on as well

00:07:56.470 --> 00:07:59.340
and I think, again, that
gives it a credibility.

00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:00.660
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubinstein:
Okay, so let's go back

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:03.130
to when you first
met Jimmy Carter.

00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:05.290
When did you first meet him?

00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:08.220
&gt;&gt; Stuart Eizenstat: This is a
good story about how in politics

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:10.390
and perhaps, in life as well,

00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:14.650
one should follow one's
heart and not mind.

00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:17.280
So after a year in the
Johnson White House

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:21.960
and then a half-a-year as Hubert
Humphrey's Research Director

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:24.630
in the '68 campaign
against Nixon, when he lost,

00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:27.410
I went back to Atlanta,
my hometown.

00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:30.270
Clerked for a federal
judge and made a beeline

00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:33.350
for the sumptuously
well-appointed office

00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:36.980
of former Governor Carl Sanders
who was going to run again.

00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:38.730
He was odds-on favorite.

00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:40.870
I said, "I'm a hometown boy.

00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:43.280
I worked in the White House
for Johnson and Humphrey.

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:44.580
I'd like to help you."

00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:46.220
He didn't need my help.

00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:49.730
He gave me a very brief meeting
and a high school friend said,

00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:53.840
"You ought to meet a former
State Senator, Jimmy Carter,

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:57.490
who has run unsuccessfully once
in 1960 and is running again.

00:08:57.490 --> 00:08:59.510
And I said, "No, I've made
a commitment to Carter.

00:08:59.510 --> 00:09:01.300
Well, he badgered me so much.

00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:02.850
I finally did.

00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:06.260
And the meeting could not
have been a greater contrast

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.650
with Carl Sanders
who was well-coifed

00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:11.300
in a well-upholstered office.

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:15.180
But Jimmy Carter, I met
him in a very stark office

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:18.480
that had one table, two
metal folding chairs.

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:20.590
He was dressed in khaki pants

00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:22.990
and an open shirt
and work boots.

00:09:22.990 --> 00:09:26.960
But what attracted me, David,
and it was an attraction

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:30.050
that has remained to
this day, is first,

00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:31.840
he was highly intelligent.

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:35.440
But second, I saw him
as someone who had come

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:40.670
from a gnat-infested hamlet of
500 people in Southwest Georgia

00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:43.160
but understood the urban
problems of Atlanta.

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:44.460
He favored mass transit.

00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:45.760
He favored education.

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:49.100
And most important for me,
he favored civil rights.

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:52.860
He said, "The time for
discrimination is over."

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:54.580
And that sold me on him.

00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:57.380
And he took that into
his governorship.

00:09:57.380 --> 00:09:59.550
That was, in fact,
the key ingredient

00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:01.560
of his inaugural
address as governor.

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:04.480
He put Martin Luther King's
portrait in the State Capitol

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:07.480
which I can assure you,
was highly unpopular.

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:10.310
And civil rights
became an enduring part

00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:12.400
of his presidential
legacy as well.

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:17.370
And so then, and again, as a
sort of humorous moment, in '74,

00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:19.700
he was appointed by Bob
Strauss, the Chairman

00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:21.000
of the Democratic
National Committee

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.030
to head the Congressional
Campaign Committee

00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:27.160
for the '74 election and
he asked me to present,

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:29.920
produce a series
of issue papers.

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:33.410
We did about 25 or 30 on every
issue critiquing the Nixon

00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:35.830
administration and
giving alternatives

00:10:35.830 --> 00:10:38.230
that Democratic candidates
could run on.

00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:40.410
When we finished that, I
called him up and I said,

00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:42.730
"I'd like to take you
out to lunch, Governor.

00:10:42.730 --> 00:10:44.210
I've got an idea."

00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:47.330
We sat at this restaurant in
Underground Atlanta and I said,

00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:49.770
"Look, I've got sort
of wild hare.

00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:52.850
If you run for president,
there's going to be a need

00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:54.150
for a Southern on the ticket.

00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:56.210
If you win a few
Southern primaries

00:10:56.210 --> 00:10:58.790
and knock George Wallace out,

00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:00.840
perhaps you'll get
the second post."

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:04.420
And he said, in his toothy
grin, "I'm going to run

00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:06.020
and I don't intend
to be vice-president.

00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:09.070
Would you like to join my
presidential campaign?"

00:11:09.070 --> 00:11:13.310
[Laughter] So from '74 on,
I became his policy director

00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:14.610
and the rest is history.

00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:15.910
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubinstein:
How did you, how did you --

00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:18.210
you were practicing law
and how did you have time

00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:20.360
to practice law and also
help him in the campaign?

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:21.660
What did you tell
your law partner?

00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:23.280
&gt;&gt; Stuart Eizenstat: The same
way, David, that people say,

00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:26.260
"How can you be on
20 nonprofit boards?

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.470
How can you run a
major corporation?"

00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:29.770
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubinstein:
Right [laughter].

00:11:29.770 --> 00:11:31.330
&gt;&gt; Stuart Eizenstat: And that
is the good Lord put 24 hours

00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:32.630
in a day.

00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:33.930
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubinstein:
All right, so you did that.

00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:37.200
Now, Carter's strategy
was fairly unique.

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:39.140
It was to focus on Iowa.

00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:41.840
Many people hadn't realized
that Iowa was so important.

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:44.050
What was his strategy
on Iowa and actually,

00:11:44.050 --> 00:11:45.840
did he win Iowa or not?

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:47.980
&gt;&gt; Stuart Eizenstat: So why
did Carter win the nomination

00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:51.970
against well-financed,
well-known congressmen

00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:55.680
and senators like Udall and Bayh

00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:58.820
and so many others,
Scoop Jackson?

00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:00.260
It was for two or three reasons.

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:04.250
First of all, he was an
indefatigable campaigner.

00:12:04.250 --> 00:12:08.200
He campaigned before the Iowa
caucuses for a hundred days

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:11.940
and before anyone knew that the
Iowa caucuses meant anything.

00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:14.850
They were, after all, only
caucuses, not a primary.

00:12:14.850 --> 00:12:17.410
He understood that under
the new McGovern rules

00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:19.080
which had just come into effect,

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:22.450
that the party bosses
would no longer be able

00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:24.660
in smoke-filled rooms
to choose a nominee.

00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:25.960
The people were going to get it.

00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:27.840
And so he went to homes.

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:31.220
He carried his own bags
and he went, again,

00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:34.980
in a hundred different
instances and Rosalynn as well.

00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:37.250
But there's a second
reason he won.

00:12:37.250 --> 00:12:40.380
And that is, he, alone among
the Democratic candidates,

00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:43.290
recognized that what the
American people wanted

00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:48.500
in the presidential election
of '76 was not a revival

00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:50.280
of LBJ's Great Society.

00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:51.580
And having worked for Johnson,

00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:52.880
it's something I
would have liked.

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:54.870
No, that's not what
people wanted.

00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:57.660
In a post-Watergate era,
they wanted honesty,

00:12:57.660 --> 00:13:00.200
integrity, transparency.

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:03.040
And when he promised,
"I'll never tell a lie.

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:04.460
A government is as
good as its people."

00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:07.740
That's what struck at the
cords of people's hearts.

00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:09.230
And did he win Iowa?

00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:13.130
This is, again, an
interesting story.

00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:17.070
He got 27% of the vote in Iowa.

00:13:17.070 --> 00:13:19.580
Birch Bayh got 13%.

00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:22.850
Undecided got 60% [laughter].

00:13:22.850 --> 00:13:26.730
Headlines, "Carter Wins
Iowa" and that vaunted us

00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:29.710
on to New Hampshire and
into the White House.

00:13:29.710 --> 00:13:31.010
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubinstein: And
as I remember, I recall,

00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:33.090
I think that the amount
of votes he got to get

00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:35.570
that percentage was about
11,000 or something like that.

00:13:35.570 --> 00:13:37.300
Today, it takes about
100,000 to win Iowa.

00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:38.620
So it's much smaller.

00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:40.830
So he goes to New Hampshire
and all of a sudden,

00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:42.130
he wins New Hampshire.

00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:43.430
Is that right?

00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:44.730
&gt;&gt; Stuart Eizenstat:
He wins New Hampshire

00:13:44.730 --> 00:13:46.030
and New Hampshire allows
itself the same kind

00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:50.430
of retail politicking that you
can do in Iowa, house-to-house,

00:13:50.430 --> 00:13:53.170
small town meetings,
town hall meetings.

00:13:53.170 --> 00:13:55.580
They want to know
that you're there.

00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:56.880
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubinstein: Right.

00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:58.950
&gt;&gt; Stuart Eizenstat: And so
again, he used that same thing.

00:13:58.950 --> 00:14:00.400
Government is as
good as its people.

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:04.130
Ethics reform, moral
high ground.

00:14:04.130 --> 00:14:06.070
But then, he began
to broaden it.

00:14:06.070 --> 00:14:09.220
After all, he was running
at a Democratic primary.

00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:11.330
He talked about the
need for education.

00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:13.660
He talked about the
need for investment.

00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:16.190
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubinstein: And
what was the Peanut Brigade?

00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:20.110
&gt;&gt; Stuart Eizenstat: So after
we won in and I put quote,

00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:23.200
unquote -- "won" in Iowa,

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:25.490
a so-called Peanut
Brigade was started

00:14:25.490 --> 00:14:26.950
by a woman named Dot Padgett.

00:14:26.950 --> 00:14:30.090
He had been, of course,
a peanut farmer,

00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:33.150
and they got together
hundreds of people from Georgia

00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:36.150
who went door-to-door
in New Hampshire,

00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:39.430
literally door-to-door,
handing out his literature.

00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:42.480
And this Peanut Brigade
plus his whole family

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:45.340
and Rosalynn being an
incredible campaigner.

00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:47.420
And this was an interesting
story in and of itself.

00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:51.260
When he ran for governor,
Rosalynn was so shy,

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:54.880
she literally shook
on the podium.

00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:56.610
She could hardly speak.

00:14:56.610 --> 00:14:59.070
She evolved into a
tremendous campaigner.

00:14:59.070 --> 00:15:01.860
And by the way, a
great First Lady.

00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:06.780
Only the second First Lady after
Eleanor Roosevelt to testify

00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:10.270
in Congress and this on her own
legislation of mental health.

00:15:10.270 --> 00:15:11.900
So she was an enormous asset.

00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:14.860
The Peanut Brigade
really spread the word

00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:17.830
and got him door-to-door
in New Hampshire.

00:15:17.830 --> 00:15:19.380
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubinstein: Are you
amazed at after all these years,

00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:22.810
people still call her
Rosalynn, Rosalynn?

00:15:22.810 --> 00:15:24.110
&gt;&gt; Stuart Eizenstat:
It's Rosalynn.

00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:25.630
It's Rosalynn but it's Rosalynn.

00:15:25.630 --> 00:15:27.880
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubinstein: Okay,
so he wins New Hampshire.

00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:30.170
He's moving forward
to get the nomination.

00:15:30.170 --> 00:15:32.930
All of a sudden, the liberals in
the party say, "Wait a second.

00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:35.930
This moderate or conservative
could be the nominee

00:15:35.930 --> 00:15:37.230
of the party."

00:15:37.230 --> 00:15:39.160
Did they try to come together
and get one candidate?

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:40.460
&gt;&gt; Stuart Eizenstat: So the rest

00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:43.480
of the crowd made a
fundamental mistake.

00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:46.920
They said, "Let's let
Carter do the dirty work

00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:50.010
of getting George Wallace,
the segregationist governor

00:15:50.010 --> 00:15:51.850
of Alabama, out of the race.

00:15:51.850 --> 00:15:55.890
We'll give him a clear field in
North Carolina and in Florida.

00:15:55.890 --> 00:15:57.910
Then we'll take him on."

00:15:57.910 --> 00:15:59.210
By then, it was too late.

00:15:59.210 --> 00:16:01.930
When we won North Carolina
and we won Florida,

00:16:01.930 --> 00:16:05.520
we developed a momentum
that was almost unstoppable

00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:08.270
but there were two
huge road bumps

00:16:08.270 --> 00:16:10.910
on the way to the nomination.

00:16:10.910 --> 00:16:16.390
The first was that going into
the first northern primary

00:16:16.390 --> 00:16:19.830
in Pennsylvania, we had
to broaden the message.

00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:22.960
He was not just a
Southern candidate.

00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:26.990
And he incorrectly thought
the way to do it was appeal

00:16:26.990 --> 00:16:31.440
to perhaps the worst instincts
of the white working class.

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:36.440
And so he used the term,
"preserving the ethnic purity

00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:40.620
of ethnic neighborhoods" --
Polish, Czech and so forth.

00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:42.240
That caused an uproar.

00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:45.630
Here was a virtually unknown
candidate and even the mayor

00:16:45.630 --> 00:16:49.150
of Atlanta, Maynard
Jackson, said,

00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:50.750
"This is not the
Jimmy Carter I know.

00:16:50.750 --> 00:16:52.820
Maybe we got the wrong guy."

00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:57.280
He was saved by one
absolutely crucial thing.

00:16:57.280 --> 00:17:01.560
Andrew Young had been the
first congressman elected

00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:04.250
from the Deep South
since reconstruction.

00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:07.160
And I have helped him and my
late wife, Fran, had helped him.

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:10.510
I called Andy up and I said,
"Andy, you know Carter.

00:17:10.510 --> 00:17:12.410
You know that he's
not a racist."

00:17:12.410 --> 00:17:17.200
Andy got Daddy King, that's
Martin Luther King Senior --

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:19.080
Junior had already
been assassinated --

00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:22.380
head of the Ebenezer Baptist
Church, who knew Carter.

00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:25.770
We had a big rally in
Piedmont Park in Atlanta.

00:17:25.770 --> 00:17:28.480
Daddy King put his arms around
him, embraced him and said,

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:30.280
"Jimmy, we know you're
a good man.

00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:32.330
We know what you mean
and we support you."

00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:33.630
And that was over.

00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:35.270
And then the other, of course,
in the general election,

00:17:35.270 --> 00:17:36.570
was a Playboy interview.

00:17:36.570 --> 00:17:38.930
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubinstein: Now, who
advised him to give an interview

00:17:38.930 --> 00:17:40.390
to Playboy and what
did he say to Playboy

00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:41.690
that got him in trouble?

00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:42.990
&gt;&gt; Stuart Eizenstat:
First of all,

00:17:42.990 --> 00:17:44.290
there were not very
many volunteers

00:17:44.290 --> 00:17:46.480
who will say they're the ones
who recommended it [laughter].

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:48.460
This is one case
where it was not me.

00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:52.490
It was Jody Powell, his Press
Secretary and Gerry Rafshoon,

00:17:52.490 --> 00:17:53.790
his Communications Director.

00:17:53.790 --> 00:17:59.880
And why? It was because they had
the sense, as we were broadening

00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:02.840
to go country-wide,
that he was seen

00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:05.550
as an uptight Baptist Southern.

00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:08.550
And they had to show
that he was a real guy.

00:18:08.550 --> 00:18:09.850
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubinstein: Okay.

00:18:09.850 --> 00:18:11.150
&gt;&gt; Stuart Eizenstat:
So what better place

00:18:11.150 --> 00:18:12.450
to do that than Playboy?

00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:15.160
Now actually, the
interview was very anodyne.

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:18.590
Basic policy questions, the
kind you and I worked on dozens

00:18:18.590 --> 00:18:20.740
of policy papers for him on.

00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:26.060
The problem was as the reporter
was leaving his house in Plains,

00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:29.460
Carter thought his
tape recorder was off.

00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:31.360
And so, as he's going
out the door, he said,

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:33.880
"By the way, you're a Baptist.

00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:37.270
What is the Baptist
view of sex?"

00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:40.170
And thinking the tape recorder
is off, he said, "Well,

00:18:40.170 --> 00:18:43.760
you know, Jesus said that
of course, a man and a woman

00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:46.790
in marriage should not have
sex outside of marriage.

00:18:46.790 --> 00:18:50.720
But man are honest, they will
have lust in their heart."

00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:53.400
There it was, headline,
Playboy interview

00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:56.490
with a provocative
model on the front,

00:18:56.490 --> 00:18:57.860
"Carter, Lust in Your Heart."

00:18:57.860 --> 00:19:00.860
Well here, the whole image
that had been built up

00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:04.120
and a realistic image of
a happily married man,

00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:06.960
a real religious
man, was busted.

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:10.570
And that all really
was a very big setback.

00:19:10.570 --> 00:19:12.530
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubinstein: But he
overcame that and ultimately,

00:19:12.530 --> 00:19:13.850
he moves forward
to the nomination.

00:19:13.850 --> 00:19:15.840
So he gets the nomination
in New York City

00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:18.530
but before the nomination
can be given,

00:19:18.530 --> 00:19:19.830
he has to pick a vice-president.

00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:21.130
Why did he pick Mondale?

00:19:21.130 --> 00:19:22.430
&gt;&gt; Stuart Eizenstat:

00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:24.440
So he picked Mondale
for several reasons.

00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:27.080
First, there was a very thorough
interviewing process done

00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:30.720
by his lawyer, Charlie
Kirbo in Atlanta.

00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:33.250
And Mondale won for
several reasons.

00:19:33.250 --> 00:19:35.410
The first is he did
his homework.

00:19:35.410 --> 00:19:37.450
He read Carter's book,
<i>Why Not the Best </i>.

00:19:37.450 --> 00:19:40.080
He read everything about him.

00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:43.080
The chemistry was
there, both with Joan,

00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:45.050
his wife, and Rosalynn.

00:19:45.050 --> 00:19:47.160
He needed a Northern liberal.

00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:49.680
He needed someone
experienced in the Senate.

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:52.030
He needed someone who was strong

00:19:52.030 --> 00:19:55.130
with the constituency
groups he was weak with --

00:19:55.130 --> 00:19:57.890
Jews, organized labor
and liberals.

00:19:57.890 --> 00:20:01.360
But there's a humorous
part to this too.

00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:05.990
There were several other
candidates who vied for the job.

00:20:05.990 --> 00:20:11.750
And one made the mistake of
saying, "By the way, Jimmy.

00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:14.550
You should know --
thinking this would help --

00:20:14.550 --> 00:20:18.010
one of my distant relatives
was General Sherman."

00:20:18.010 --> 00:20:19.310
[Laughter] Well, the march

00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:21.380
through Georgia is still
remembered to this day.

00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:22.680
That did not help.

00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:25.810
The other one said, "You know,
I want you to know that one

00:20:25.810 --> 00:20:28.510
of my favorite foods
is blue-eyed peas."

00:20:28.510 --> 00:20:32.410
[ Laughter ]

00:20:32.410 --> 00:20:33.710
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubinstein: Right.

00:20:33.710 --> 00:20:35.010
&gt;&gt; Stuart Eizenstat:
So [laughter],

00:20:35.010 --> 00:20:39.320
Mondale did not say
"blue-eyed peas."

00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:40.820
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubinstein:
So Mondale is selected

00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:43.910
and then the general election
campaign against the incumbent

00:20:43.910 --> 00:20:47.620
but never again elected
President Gerald Ford.

00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:48.920
There were presidential debates.

00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:51.880
Now there had never been
presidential debates before

00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:53.180
except in John Kennedy's --

00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:54.480
&gt;&gt; Stuart Eizenstat: In 1960.

00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:57.550
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubinstein: -- 1960
but why did Carter agree to it?

00:20:57.550 --> 00:20:59.270
Who challenged who
for the debates

00:20:59.270 --> 00:21:01.230
and how did you prepare
Carter for the debates?

00:21:01.230 --> 00:21:03.430
&gt;&gt; Stuart Eizenstat:
So we challenged Ford

00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:05.510
because we thought it
was important to go

00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:07.200
on to a national stage

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:10.060
and demonstrate we could
go toe-to-toe with him.

00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:13.850
And you and I helped prepare
briefing books for him.

00:21:13.850 --> 00:21:16.690
And I have to say again,
in one of my mistakes,

00:21:16.690 --> 00:21:19.450
I prepared a briefing book
and I'm not exaggerating,

00:21:19.450 --> 00:21:20.750
that was six inches thick.

00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:23.260
I mean, that's not how you
brief a president for a debate.

00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:26.790
You give him questions
and answers and repose.

00:21:26.790 --> 00:21:30.490
He refused also, out
of hubris, to practice.

00:21:30.490 --> 00:21:32.440
Absolutely no practice.

00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:36.330
The first question
and the first debate

00:21:36.330 --> 00:21:38.660
in Philadelphia was a softball.

00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:41.910
We had run against
the "Ford recession"

00:21:41.910 --> 00:21:46.010
against unemployment
and high inflation.

00:21:46.010 --> 00:21:49.120
The first question so
predictable is, "Mr. Carter,

00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:51.790
what would you do
for the economy?"

00:21:51.790 --> 00:21:53.310
He totally blew the answer.

00:21:53.310 --> 00:21:55.830
I mean, I almost
fell off my chair.

00:21:55.830 --> 00:21:58.580
What saved us was
the second debate.

00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:01.980
In the second debate which
was the foreign policy debate,

00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:06.700
Ford was asked the following
question, "What do you think

00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:09.910
about the Soviet domination
of Eastern Europe?"

00:22:09.910 --> 00:22:12.190
We're in the Cold War.

00:22:12.190 --> 00:22:15.560
And Ford says, "There
is no Soviet domination

00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:16.920
of the Soviet Union."

00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:19.830
And Max Frankel from the
<i>New York Times </i>says, "Now,

00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:21.250
did I hear you correctly?

00:22:21.250 --> 00:22:24.720
Are you saying the Soviet
Union doesn't dominate

00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:26.020
Eastern Europe?"

00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:27.320
"Yes, that's what I mean."

00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:28.760
What he meant didn't
dominate the Soviet people.

00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:32.690
Carter just latched
onto it and he said,

00:22:32.690 --> 00:22:36.510
"I think the Czech Americans
and the Polish Americans

00:22:36.510 --> 00:22:39.360
and the Ukrainian Americans
would very much disagree."

00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:41.200
Of course, they do.

00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:44.230
And Ford didn't realize and
I interviewed Jim Baker,

00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:46.930
one of the 350 people
who was interviewed,

00:22:46.930 --> 00:22:49.290
who was his campaign manager.

00:22:49.290 --> 00:22:51.740
And he said for three days,

00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:54.670
they tried to convince Ford he
had made an egregious mistake.

00:22:54.670 --> 00:22:56.700
He needed to apologize
and he didn't.

00:22:56.700 --> 00:22:58.750
That really turned the
tables and it showed

00:22:58.750 --> 00:23:03.150
that this one term Georgia
governor could handle the job

00:23:03.150 --> 00:23:08.640
as well as a 25-year
congressman in the White House.

00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:10.430
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubinstein:
So Carter gets elected

00:23:10.430 --> 00:23:16.080
and when he's elected, he says,
"Okay, I had a secret group

00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:18.650
that was preparing
for my election,

00:23:18.650 --> 00:23:20.790
a pre-election transition group.

00:23:20.790 --> 00:23:22.480
I'm now going to have
them run the transition

00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:23.780
and presumably the government."

00:23:23.780 --> 00:23:25.590
And then there were the people
working at the campaign.

00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:26.920
So what happened
in the transition

00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:29.610
between the two groups clashing
about who was really going

00:23:29.610 --> 00:23:30.910
to run the transition?

00:23:30.910 --> 00:23:32.540
&gt;&gt; Stuart Eizenstat: Well,
this was a forerunner

00:23:32.540 --> 00:23:35.080
of the organizational
problems that I like to talk

00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:39.410
about in the White House
because unbeknownst to us,

00:23:39.410 --> 00:23:44.230
Carter had asked Jack Watson,
a very, very talented attorney

00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:45.970
and Charlie Kirbo's partner,

00:23:45.970 --> 00:23:49.150
to have a separate
transition group working

00:23:49.150 --> 00:23:52.500
on the same policies you and I
were working on in the trenches.

00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:56.270
But when you work 24 hours
a day, seven days a week

00:23:56.270 --> 00:23:59.500
and your candidate wins, you
expect to have a major job.

00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:02.460
Well, so did the people in
this other transition group.

00:24:02.460 --> 00:24:04.930
And there was a tremendous
clash between them

00:24:04.930 --> 00:24:06.230
that was resolved only

00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:09.090
in the last few days
before we took over.

00:24:09.090 --> 00:24:10.450
So it caused a real problem.

00:24:10.450 --> 00:24:13.270
But on a more positive
note during the transition,

00:24:13.270 --> 00:24:18.020
Mondale reluctantly decided
to run for vice-president

00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:20.180
because his mentor,

00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:24.440
Hubert Humphrey had been
humiliated by Lyndon Johnson.

00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:27.190
Humiliated -- not
allowed in the meetings.

00:24:27.190 --> 00:24:29.590
He often waited half-an-hour,
the Vice President

00:24:29.590 --> 00:24:32.790
of the United States
in front of the staff

00:24:32.790 --> 00:24:35.260
of like Joe [Inaudible]
for a meeting.

00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:38.540
He was not given access
to secret documents.

00:24:38.540 --> 00:24:40.250
He wanted to make sure
that didn't happen.

00:24:40.250 --> 00:24:43.530
So he sent Carter and
the transition a memo

00:24:43.530 --> 00:24:48.230
with 10 requests, access to all
papers, access to all meetings,

00:24:48.230 --> 00:24:50.780
one-on-one lunches
in the White House.

00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:53.220
And Carter approved
every one of them

00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:55.430
and added one additional one.

00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:58.740
And that is, anyone who knows
anything about real estate,

00:24:58.740 --> 00:25:00.650
its location, location,
location.

00:25:00.650 --> 00:25:02.060
It's the same in politics.

00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:05.090
He moved the Vice President's
Office to where it is today,

00:25:05.090 --> 00:25:07.370
right down the hall
in the West Wing

00:25:07.370 --> 00:25:09.620
and that location
said everything

00:25:09.620 --> 00:25:11.430
about Mondale's stature.

00:25:11.430 --> 00:25:13.240
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubinstein: Now,
Carter didn't really know most

00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:15.090
of the people he selected
to be cabinet officers.

00:25:15.090 --> 00:25:17.600
How did he actually
select the cabinet?

00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:19.580
&gt;&gt; Stuart Eizenstat: The
cabinet was selected in part

00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:23.380
by Ham Jordan, who was his
de facto chief of staff,

00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:25.280
by Kirbo and by Mondale.

00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:28.400
And Mondale got a lot of
the people he had known,

00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:32.470
Bob Birkeland, Adams and
others into the position.

00:25:32.470 --> 00:25:38.170
Now, the key two positions and
here was my first disagreement

00:25:38.170 --> 00:25:40.260
as he was coming into office.

00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:45.360
So I was the only campaign
aide who Carter allowed to sit

00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:50.530
in on the post-election
CIA briefings in Plains.

00:25:50.530 --> 00:25:51.860
He was now president-elect.

00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:55.700
And during one of the
breaks in the briefings,

00:25:55.700 --> 00:25:57.350
we went off to the
side of his house.

00:25:57.350 --> 00:26:01.440
He said, "Stu, I'm thinking of
appointing Cy Vance as Secretary

00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:04.970
of State and Zbig Brzezinski as
my National Security Advisor."

00:26:04.970 --> 00:26:07.820
And of course, because I
had coordinated all policy,

00:26:07.820 --> 00:26:09.120
I worked on foreign policy.

00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:10.810
We had a foreign policy group.

00:26:10.810 --> 00:26:13.470
I said, "Mr. President,
either one would be great

00:26:13.470 --> 00:26:16.580
for that position but
together, they would be poison.

00:26:16.580 --> 00:26:17.880
It won't work."

00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:19.180
And he said, "Why?"

00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:22.270
And I said, "Because
Cy is a dove

00:26:22.270 --> 00:26:26.790
on the Soviet Union
and Zbig is a hawk.

00:26:26.790 --> 00:26:29.720
And you will have great
difficulty reconciling it."

00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:32.410
And he said, "I like
differences of opinion.

00:26:32.410 --> 00:26:33.750
I can handle it."

00:26:33.750 --> 00:26:36.810
The fact is it created a
dissonance on foreign policy

00:26:36.810 --> 00:26:40.720
that was not resolved until the
Soviets invaded Afghanistan,

00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:44.080
Christmas 1979 when
Carter clearly landed

00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:46.920
into the hardline
camp of Brzezinski.

00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:48.580
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubinstein: So
Carter was criticized early

00:26:48.580 --> 00:26:51.760
on for having a bunch
of Georgians

00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:53.060
who were inexperienced.

00:26:53.060 --> 00:26:54.360
You had worked in
the White House

00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:56.500
but you were still
only 34 years old.

00:26:56.500 --> 00:26:57.870
The others were actually
younger than you.

00:26:57.870 --> 00:26:59.600
Do you think Carter
made a mistake at having

00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:02.090
so many Georgians who had
no experience around him?

00:27:02.090 --> 00:27:03.770
&gt;&gt; Stuart Eizenstat: It's
actually 33 but that's okay.

00:27:03.770 --> 00:27:05.180
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubinstein:
Thirty-three [laughter]?

00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:06.480
Okay.

00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:07.780
&gt;&gt; Stuart Eizenstat: But yes,

00:27:07.780 --> 00:27:12.720
the answer is every president
brings his campaign staff

00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:14.020
with him.

00:27:14.020 --> 00:27:15.580
It's the Boston mafia
with Kennedy.

00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:19.610
It's the Austin mafia
with LBJ and so forth.

00:27:19.610 --> 00:27:24.150
But the difference is those
were people who knew Washington,

00:27:24.150 --> 00:27:27.780
who had themselves
been in the Congress

00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:29.880
or in central positions.

00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:32.740
So Carter came in without
one day's experience,

00:27:32.740 --> 00:27:34.860
have never been in the
White House, brought people

00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:37.870
into the White House as his
top aides who had never been

00:27:37.870 --> 00:27:41.980
in the White House, and then
made the fatal error thinking

00:27:41.980 --> 00:27:46.360
that the real problem with
Watergate was Bob Haldeman,

00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:50.240
Nixon's chief of staff
who kept everyone away.

00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:52.180
And that was not the problem.

00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:56.300
The problem was Haldeman
was a crook [laughter].

00:27:56.300 --> 00:28:01.930
The chief of staff is essential
and Ford, also, after the pardon

00:28:01.930 --> 00:28:03.810
of Nixon, when he
became president,

00:28:03.810 --> 00:28:05.110
he had been a congressman.

00:28:05.110 --> 00:28:07.070
He didn't want a
chief of staff either.

00:28:07.070 --> 00:28:10.090
The first weeks of the Ford
presidency were chaotic

00:28:10.090 --> 00:28:12.830
and Dick Cheney told me
in one of the interviews,

00:28:12.830 --> 00:28:15.240
he became his chief of staff

00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:20.060
that they gave Cheney a broken
bicycle wheel when he was going

00:28:20.060 --> 00:28:24.250
out as staff to show that
the system that Ford had

00:28:24.250 --> 00:28:26.280
and that Carter ended
up adopting

00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:28.120
which is called the
spokes, the wheel where five

00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:30.370
or six presidential
aides have equal access

00:28:30.370 --> 00:28:32.810
and there's no chief
of staff was wrong.

00:28:32.810 --> 00:28:36.610
And he left that broken bicycle
wheel on [Inaudible] offices

00:28:36.610 --> 00:28:37.910
and said, "It's a mistake.

00:28:37.910 --> 00:28:39.210
Don't do it."

00:28:39.210 --> 00:28:40.510
But Carter didn't listen.

00:28:40.510 --> 00:28:41.980
And he didn't have
a chief of staff

00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:44.240
and he didn't have an
experienced chief of staff.

00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:46.780
Reagan learned the lesson.

00:28:46.780 --> 00:28:48.400
What did Reagan do when he won?

00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:50.460
He also was inexperienced
in Washington.

00:28:50.460 --> 00:28:53.660
He had Jim Baker, who had
been the campaign manager

00:28:53.660 --> 00:28:56.740
of his opponent, George H.W.
Bush as his chief of staff.

00:28:56.740 --> 00:28:58.410
That made all the
difference in the world.

00:28:58.410 --> 00:28:59.780
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubinstein: So
Carter is elected president

00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:01.840
of the United States, the
first Democratic president

00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:03.140
in eight years.

00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:04.440
The Congress are
controlled by the Democrats

00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:06.350
so the Democrats just do
whatever Carter wants.

00:29:06.350 --> 00:29:10.250
Is that right or it didn't
happen that way [laughter]?

00:29:10.250 --> 00:29:11.550
&gt;&gt; Stuart Eizenstat:
Maybe if it was Republican

00:29:11.550 --> 00:29:13.320
but this is a Democrat.

00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:15.370
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubinstein: So why
didn't they like him better?

00:29:15.370 --> 00:29:17.470
&gt;&gt; Stuart Eizenstat:
First of all, they did.

00:29:17.470 --> 00:29:20.180
One of the things and the
myths that I try to puncture is

00:29:20.180 --> 00:29:22.480
that he was unsuccessful
with Congress.

00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:26.280
Congress passed almost 70%
of his legislation according

00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:29.080
to two independent surveys,
just under the percent

00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:31.450
of the legendary Lyndon Johnson.

00:29:31.450 --> 00:29:35.870
The problem was, however,
that he proposed, David,

00:29:35.870 --> 00:29:39.700
so much at the same time,
so many major priorities --

00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:43.550
welfare reform, tax reform,
health insurance and so forth,

00:29:43.550 --> 00:29:46.140
Panama Canal, Seoul Treaty --

00:29:46.140 --> 00:29:52.140
that it got lost and he had
not the capacity of showing

00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:53.950
that half-a-loaf was a victory.

00:29:53.950 --> 00:29:56.950
He was so moralistic that
compromising became difficult.

00:29:56.950 --> 00:30:00.300
So we achieved an enormous
amount but it always paled

00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:03.360
in comparison to
what we had proposed.

00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:08.770
And the Democratic Party was
very much split between --

00:30:08.770 --> 00:30:12.330
he had two bases,
Southern conservatives

00:30:12.330 --> 00:30:14.280
and the Northern liberals.

00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:17.400
And in the Senate, in
particular, Tip in the House,

00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:20.050
Tip O'Neill -- they
passed everything.

00:30:20.050 --> 00:30:22.850
The Senate became an Indian
burial ground for a lot

00:30:22.850 --> 00:30:24.920
of his legislation
because of this division.

00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:28.700
In the end again, we achieved a
lot but it was done with a lot

00:30:28.700 --> 00:30:30.000
of blood on the table.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:31.460
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubinstein: How
about Carter's working style?

00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:33.040
Did he like to be
briefed orally?

00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:34.500
They liked to read memos?

00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:36.890
Did he like to call the
staff in and ask questions?

00:30:36.890 --> 00:30:39.800
&gt;&gt; Stuart Eizenstat: So
David, you have been a CEO,

00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:42.980
just stepped down, and you
interview CEOs for your program.

00:30:42.980 --> 00:30:46.090
The president of the United
States is the chief executive

00:30:46.090 --> 00:30:49.360
officer of the largest
enterprise in the world.

00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:53.750
Trillions of dollars of
revenue, of expenditures,

00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:56.360
tens of millions of employees.

00:30:56.360 --> 00:31:00.200
But the president
constitutionally has very

00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:01.500
few powers.

00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:06.610
He's the commander-in-chief
and that's it.

00:31:06.610 --> 00:31:09.420
Carter failed to recognize
it was his weakness

00:31:09.420 --> 00:31:10.720
but also his strength

00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:13.380
for reasons I'll
mention in a minute.

00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:15.380
He failed to realize
that the president has

00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:18.180
to be politician-in-chief.

00:31:18.180 --> 00:31:22.160
He has to take the relatively
weak constitutional powers,

00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:27.900
unite his party, coax people
to support him, schmooze,

00:31:27.900 --> 00:31:32.030
do the small favors, notes
on birthdays, a project here

00:31:32.030 --> 00:31:33.330
and there to get a vote.

00:31:33.330 --> 00:31:35.130
He had great difficulty
doing that.

00:31:35.130 --> 00:31:37.870
He saw the job as more
of an academic job.

00:31:37.870 --> 00:31:41.670
He made decisions
by written memoranda

00:31:41.670 --> 00:31:43.020
and he read voraciously.

00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:45.970
He always wanted more and
more and more information.

00:31:45.970 --> 00:31:49.050
He would sometimes circle our
decision memos with misspellings

00:31:49.050 --> 00:31:50.770
and grammatical errors.

00:31:50.770 --> 00:31:53.150
Now mind you, that's a lot
better way to make decisions

00:31:53.150 --> 00:31:56.370
than what we see in tweets
but still [laughter],

00:31:56.370 --> 00:31:58.330
it was -- it was a problem.

00:31:58.330 --> 00:32:03.600
And the human contact on
decisions is important.

00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:05.310
It empowers cabinet officers.

00:32:05.310 --> 00:32:07.180
It empowers the Congress.

00:32:07.180 --> 00:32:08.590
When they see the president,

00:32:08.590 --> 00:32:10.830
when he can see the
pressures personally --

00:32:10.830 --> 00:32:12.130
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubinstein: Right.

00:32:12.130 --> 00:32:13.430
So the best way to
convince Carter was to say,

00:32:13.430 --> 00:32:15.090
"This would help
you politically."

00:32:15.090 --> 00:32:16.980
&gt;&gt; Stuart Eizenstat: Ham
Jordan told me very early on,

00:32:16.980 --> 00:32:21.580
he had been Carter's
principal supporter and aide

00:32:21.580 --> 00:32:23.920
and the genius behind
the '76 campaign.

00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:25.590
He said, "Stu, I want to
give you an early lesson

00:32:25.590 --> 00:32:27.020
in the White House.

00:32:27.020 --> 00:32:29.380
Never say, Mr. President,

00:32:29.380 --> 00:32:32.830
this decision will help you
politically or you'll lose."

00:32:32.830 --> 00:32:36.070
He had a very odd
view of politics.

00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:39.950
He was a ferocious
campaigner but he wanted

00:32:39.950 --> 00:32:42.500
to do what he considered
the right thing politically

00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:46.130
and then hope that the political
chips ultimately would fall

00:32:46.130 --> 00:32:47.430
his way.

00:32:47.430 --> 00:32:50.320
Again, failing to recognize
you have to marry politics

00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:52.160
and policy all the time.

00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:55.140
So again, we never
said, "Mr. President,

00:32:55.140 --> 00:32:56.490
this decision will
help you politically."

00:32:56.490 --> 00:32:59.190
Now that was his weakness
but it was his strength.

00:32:59.190 --> 00:33:00.920
Because of that, he
was willing to take

00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:03.810
on issues others wouldn't
-- the Panama Canal Treaty,

00:33:03.810 --> 00:33:06.660
the Middle East peace
process, the energy policy --

00:33:06.660 --> 00:33:08.370
knowing it would
hurt him politically,

00:33:08.370 --> 00:33:09.670
knowing it would be bloody.

00:33:09.670 --> 00:33:10.970
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubinstein:

00:33:10.970 --> 00:33:12.320
Did he approve people
using the tennis courts?

00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:14.240
That was a rumor always.

00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:15.540
&gt;&gt; Stuart Eizenstat:
Well, I mean,

00:33:15.540 --> 00:33:17.940
this is -- this is such a myth.

00:33:17.940 --> 00:33:22.760
The fact is, he was incredibly
generous to us as a staff.

00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:25.040
He did things that no
other president did.

00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:27.860
He allowed his senior staff
to have Camp David which,

00:33:27.860 --> 00:33:31.150
by the way, he almost sold along
with the presidential Sequoia

00:33:31.150 --> 00:33:33.140
as a way of saving money.

00:33:33.140 --> 00:33:36.690
But he let us use that on
weekends which was a godsend.

00:33:36.690 --> 00:33:40.120
And he let his staff
use the tennis court.

00:33:40.120 --> 00:33:42.950
He only said, "Sign
up so I'm not on

00:33:42.950 --> 00:33:45.410
or Rosalynn's not on
at the same time."

00:33:45.410 --> 00:33:49.310
The notion that he micromanaged
the schedule is just incorrect

00:33:49.310 --> 00:33:52.860
but it fit in with this notion
of excessive attention to detail

00:33:52.860 --> 00:33:56.270
that was actually an act of
huge generosity to his staff.

00:33:56.270 --> 00:33:57.570
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubinstein:
So let's talk

00:33:57.570 --> 00:33:59.680
about what some people would
say was his greatest success,

00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:00.980
Camp David.

00:34:00.980 --> 00:34:03.630
He tried to get in the middle of
the Middle East peace process.

00:34:03.630 --> 00:34:06.220
He invited Sadat and
Begin to Camp David.

00:34:06.220 --> 00:34:08.380
Was that an idea that
everybody thought was good

00:34:08.380 --> 00:34:09.730
and how did he actually
pull that off

00:34:09.730 --> 00:34:11.080
over a 13-day period of time?

00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:13.330
&gt;&gt; Stuart Eizenstat: So Anwar
Sadat, the president of Egypt,

00:34:13.330 --> 00:34:18.360
made a historic trip to
Jerusalem to start the process.

00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:19.750
Then an impasse developed.

00:34:19.750 --> 00:34:22.700
They simply couldn't resolve
their major differences.

00:34:22.700 --> 00:34:25.510
He wanted everything
back from the Sinai.

00:34:25.510 --> 00:34:28.290
So Carter, in an
act of desperation,

00:34:28.290 --> 00:34:33.510
thinking that Sadat's whole
historic effort would fail,

00:34:33.510 --> 00:34:34.850
took a risk that almost all

00:34:34.850 --> 00:34:36.810
of his advisers advised
him not to do.

00:34:36.810 --> 00:34:38.110
He invited them

00:34:38.110 --> 00:34:40.460
to the presidential
retreat at Camp David.

00:34:40.460 --> 00:34:44.400
Through 13 agonizing
days and nights,

00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:48.300
Carter personally
wrote 20 drafts.

00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:51.130
He negotiated separately
with Menachem Begin,

00:34:51.130 --> 00:34:53.580
the prime minister of Israel
and with Sadat because they were

00:34:53.580 --> 00:34:55.270
like two scorpions
in the bottle.

00:34:55.270 --> 00:34:58.790
They never met except the
first day and the last.

00:34:58.790 --> 00:35:01.330
And then he added
two personal touches.

00:35:01.330 --> 00:35:04.860
And compare that with some of
the summits we've seen recently.

00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:09.330
Number one, the first of
the Sundays of the 13 days,

00:35:09.330 --> 00:35:13.100
he took them to Gettysburg, to
the battlefield to demonstrate

00:35:13.100 --> 00:35:15.420
that five wars were enough.

00:35:15.420 --> 00:35:16.790
Sadat was a general.

00:35:16.790 --> 00:35:18.470
He knew Pickett's charge.

00:35:18.470 --> 00:35:20.510
And Begin was so moved,

00:35:20.510 --> 00:35:23.640
he actually verbatim did
the Gettysburg Address.

00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:27.110
And then the last Sunday, we
were very close to an agreement

00:35:27.110 --> 00:35:29.740
but not there, the 13th day.

00:35:29.740 --> 00:35:31.880
And Begin said, "Mr.
President, I've had it.

00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:33.340
No more compromises.

00:35:33.340 --> 00:35:35.430
I've got an El Al
plane waiting for me.

00:35:35.430 --> 00:35:36.730
Get me out of here."

00:35:36.730 --> 00:35:39.280
He called it a luscious
concentration camp.

00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:43.320
Carter knowing that this
would blow up the Middle East

00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:48.030
and his own presidency,
knowing what Begin loved

00:35:48.030 --> 00:35:51.710
which was his grandchildren,
he got eight photographs

00:35:51.710 --> 00:35:55.930
of himself, Sadat and
Begin at Camp David,

00:35:55.930 --> 00:35:57.400
personally autographed them,

00:35:57.400 --> 00:36:02.170
walked them over to Begin's
cabin, handed it to them.

00:36:02.170 --> 00:36:05.410
And saw tears well
up in Begin's eyes

00:36:05.410 --> 00:36:07.200
as he read each of his names.

00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:10.130
He put his bags down and said,
"I'll make one last try,"

00:36:10.130 --> 00:36:11.430
and the rest is history.

00:36:11.430 --> 00:36:12.910
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubinstein: Right,
so they got the agreement.

00:36:12.910 --> 00:36:16.370
They came down with it to
the White House [applause].

00:36:16.370 --> 00:36:19.150
But then it still took time
for Carter had to go back

00:36:19.150 --> 00:36:21.300
to the Middle East and
do some of the summit --

00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:22.600
&gt;&gt; Stuart Eizenstat: Yes
and this was even more.

00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:24.360
Everybody thinks the end
of it was Camp David.

00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:26.160
Camp David was a framework.

00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:28.480
It wasn't a binding treaty.

00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:30.930
There was supposed to be
three months to finish it.

00:36:30.930 --> 00:36:32.730
In six months, they
still hadn't.

00:36:32.730 --> 00:36:34.470
So Carter took another risk.

00:36:34.470 --> 00:36:36.930
And this was unanimously
opposed.

00:36:36.930 --> 00:36:38.910
He went back to the
region to try

00:36:38.910 --> 00:36:41.860
to put this back
into a formal treaty.

00:36:41.860 --> 00:36:43.860
And again, it looked
like we had failed.

00:36:43.860 --> 00:36:48.290
The last day, Carter was
in the King David Hotel.

00:36:48.290 --> 00:36:50.630
He was -- already
got his bags packed.

00:36:50.630 --> 00:36:53.400
The air space was
cleared for Air Force One.

00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:55.160
Begin calls and says,
"Mr. President,

00:36:55.160 --> 00:36:57.050
I'd like to come see
you for breakfast."

00:36:57.050 --> 00:37:00.730
Carter not expecting it,
says to us in the lobby,

00:37:00.730 --> 00:37:03.530
"Would you please entertain
the Prime Minister while I get

00:37:03.530 --> 00:37:05.010
dressed and ready?"

00:37:05.010 --> 00:37:07.960
So Begin says to us, "You know,

00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:10.990
this is a very famous
hotel, the King David."

00:37:10.990 --> 00:37:13.060
I said, "Yes, I understand."

00:37:13.060 --> 00:37:15.270
He said, "No, not for
the reasons you think.

00:37:15.270 --> 00:37:17.640
When I was head of the Irgun
during the British occupation,

00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:19.770
I blew this hotel up [laughter].

00:37:19.770 --> 00:37:21.070
Don't worry.

00:37:21.070 --> 00:37:22.820
I'm not going to do it while
the President is here."

00:37:22.820 --> 00:37:25.170
But that breakfast
ended up sealing it.

00:37:25.170 --> 00:37:27.920
And then we had a treaty
that has not been violated

00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:32.910
in any iota for 40 years
central to Israel security.

00:37:32.910 --> 00:37:34.210
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubinstein: Okay.

00:37:34.210 --> 00:37:35.510
&gt;&gt; Stuart Eizenstat: And the --

00:37:35.510 --> 00:37:36.810
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubinstein:
For 40 years,

00:37:36.810 --> 00:37:38.110
the treaty has not
been violated.

00:37:38.110 --> 00:37:39.410
There's peace between
Egypt and Israel.

00:37:39.410 --> 00:37:42.010
And why is it that
Carter is not that popular

00:37:42.010 --> 00:37:43.310
in the Jewish community?

00:37:43.310 --> 00:37:44.610
&gt;&gt; Stuart Eizenstat: All right,
so this is very painful for me

00:37:44.610 --> 00:37:46.950
as a member of the
Jewish community.

00:37:46.950 --> 00:37:50.150
Here's a president that
gave Israel its first peace

00:37:50.150 --> 00:37:55.620
with its most powerful Arab
enemy, Egypt, who broke the back

00:37:55.620 --> 00:37:58.770
of the Arab boycott with the
Arab boycott legislation,

00:37:58.770 --> 00:38:00.990
who was the unquestioned father

00:38:00.990 --> 00:38:05.680
of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial
Museum, who championed the cause

00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:08.620
of Soviet Jewry and got
a doubling of immigration

00:38:08.620 --> 00:38:12.510
and saved Natan Sharansky's
life during his trial.

00:38:12.510 --> 00:38:16.360
And who saved 50,000
Iranian Jews during the

00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:18.700
Ayatollah's reign.

00:38:18.700 --> 00:38:21.520
And yet, he gets the lowest
percentage of Jewish votes

00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:23.860
of any Democratic candidate.

00:38:23.860 --> 00:38:27.900
Why? First because to achieve
that peace in the Middle East,

00:38:27.900 --> 00:38:30.910
there was a lot of glass
that had to be broken,

00:38:30.910 --> 00:38:33.490
a lot of pressure
was put on Israel.

00:38:33.490 --> 00:38:37.080
Second, he had very
difficult relations with Rabin

00:38:37.080 --> 00:38:38.380
and particularly with Begin.

00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:42.970
Begin was the first Likud
prime minister after 30 years

00:38:42.970 --> 00:38:46.220
of Labor prime ministers who
believed that Israel had a claim

00:38:46.220 --> 00:38:50.000
to everything between the
Mediterranean and the Jordan.

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:52.870
And this was very
difficult for him to accept.

00:38:52.870 --> 00:38:55.000
And so there were
repeated clashes

00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:00.070
and most important perhaps,
he analogized the plight

00:39:00.070 --> 00:39:04.140
of the Palestinians to the
plight of the African-Americans

00:39:04.140 --> 00:39:07.560
with whom he grew up in a county
that was two-thirds black,

00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:10.780
where he played with them but
couldn't go to school with them.

00:39:10.780 --> 00:39:13.900
And he said to me
in my interview,

00:39:13.900 --> 00:39:17.830
"The white police
treated blacks better

00:39:17.830 --> 00:39:20.240
than the IDF treated
the Palestinians."

00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:22.530
Now, I've argued with him
about the [inaudible].

00:39:22.530 --> 00:39:23.830
That was his belief.

00:39:23.830 --> 00:39:26.320
He saw it through
civil rights lenses

00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:30.890
and then the final coup
came 30 years after he left

00:39:30.890 --> 00:39:34.000
with his book, <i>Apartheid
or Peace </i>and

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:36.130
that really sealed the verdict.

00:39:36.130 --> 00:39:37.430
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubinstein: So
let's switch for a moment

00:39:37.430 --> 00:39:39.980
to the Iranian's hostage crisis.

00:39:39.980 --> 00:39:42.820
The Shah leaves Iran,
forced out.

00:39:42.820 --> 00:39:45.490
Carter ultimately lets him
in to the United States.

00:39:45.490 --> 00:39:49.640
Why did he let him do that and
why did Carter not do anything

00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:51.320
for one year in terms
of the hostages

00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:52.620
and leaving the White House

00:39:52.620 --> 00:39:55.320
or why did he make the hostage
crisis such a big thing?

00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:57.370
&gt;&gt; Stuart Eizenstat: So I don't
think it's fair to blame Carter

00:39:57.370 --> 00:40:00.440
for the Iranian revolution
any more than it would be fair

00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:02.500
to blame Eisenhower for
the Castro revolution

00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:04.660
or Obama for Mubarak falling.

00:40:04.660 --> 00:40:07.070
But we made huge mistakes.

00:40:07.070 --> 00:40:10.360
The first was letting the
Shah in for medical treatment.

00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:14.210
Now this is the worst failure
in intelligence history.

00:40:14.210 --> 00:40:18.180
The CIA did not know that the
principal ally we had put back

00:40:18.180 --> 00:40:23.150
on the throne in 1953 had lost
his political support at home

00:40:23.150 --> 00:40:26.450
and was getting cancer
treatments for five years.

00:40:26.450 --> 00:40:29.520
So he wants to come in
for cancer treatments.

00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:31.340
Carter is the last holdout.

00:40:31.340 --> 00:40:36.660
He said to us point blank,
"I think if we let him in,

00:40:36.660 --> 00:40:39.680
the radicals will try to
capture our hostages."

00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:43.320
And everybody said including
Rockefeller, David Rockefeller

00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:45.270
and Kissinger outside who
were organizing the effort,

00:40:45.270 --> 00:40:48.510
"You can't let an ally
of 30 years down."

00:40:48.510 --> 00:40:50.930
So he let him in and the
hostages [inaudible].

00:40:50.930 --> 00:40:53.390
Then the mistake was we --

00:40:53.390 --> 00:40:56.740
I recommended and Brzezinski
recommended immediate military

00:40:56.740 --> 00:40:59.960
action, not bombing but
manning the harbors,

00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:02.030
keeping the oil from coming out.

00:41:02.030 --> 00:41:03.330
He refused.

00:41:03.330 --> 00:41:04.700
He said to the hostages'
families,

00:41:04.700 --> 00:41:06.720
"My first priority is
getting your loved ones

00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:08.020
out safe and sound."

00:41:08.020 --> 00:41:09.970
He did but at great
political cost.

00:41:09.970 --> 00:41:14.180
He holed himself up in the White
House and that really showed

00:41:14.180 --> 00:41:16.750
that he was a prisoner, a
hostage himself and then

00:41:16.750 --> 00:41:21.260
of course, the failed rescue
effort doomed the presidency.

00:41:21.260 --> 00:41:23.870
And it was not due to
too few helicopters.

00:41:23.870 --> 00:41:27.080
He ordered two more than
was ordered by the military.

00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:29.630
It was because four
military services, David,

00:41:29.630 --> 00:41:32.420
had never practiced the
whole exercise together.

00:41:32.420 --> 00:41:34.020
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubinstein: Right,
so despite all these problems,

00:41:34.020 --> 00:41:36.300
Carter was the nominee
of his party.

00:41:36.300 --> 00:41:38.800
He had a contest against
Ted Kennedy in 1980.

00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:41.180
Do you think had
Kennedy not run,

00:41:41.180 --> 00:41:43.340
Carter might have been
a stronger candidate

00:41:43.340 --> 00:41:44.640
in the general elections?

00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:45.940
&gt;&gt; Stuart Eizenstat:
There's no question about it.

00:41:45.940 --> 00:41:47.630
I mean, Ford, in
part lost in '76

00:41:47.630 --> 00:41:49.200
because Reagan challenged him.

00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:52.980
It split the party and it was
over national health insurance

00:41:52.980 --> 00:41:55.310
which just was not
affordable at this time.

00:41:55.310 --> 00:41:57.840
Kennedy never reconciled
after the convention.

00:41:57.840 --> 00:41:59.580
There was no holding of hands.

00:41:59.580 --> 00:42:01.710
He didn't campaign
with him actively.

00:42:01.710 --> 00:42:03.350
That would have made
a huge difference.

00:42:03.350 --> 00:42:05.980
At the end, however,
it was inflation

00:42:05.980 --> 00:42:07.570
and the hostage crisis
that did [inaudible].

00:42:07.570 --> 00:42:08.870
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubinstein: So
I remember thinking then,

00:42:08.870 --> 00:42:12.220
I was 31 years old
and we wanted to run

00:42:12.220 --> 00:42:14.240
against Ronald Reagan
because he was 69.

00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:17.170
I thought, "How can
anybody 69 possibly be able

00:42:17.170 --> 00:42:18.470
to do anything?"

00:42:18.470 --> 00:42:21.300
I'm now 69 so it doesn't
look as bad as it did then

00:42:21.300 --> 00:42:24.920
but [laughter] why did we want
to run against Ronald Reagan?

00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:26.290
&gt;&gt; Stuart Eizenstat: We wanted
to run against Ronald Reagan

00:42:26.290 --> 00:42:32.700
but we thought that he was
a trigger-happy cowboy,

00:42:32.700 --> 00:42:35.800
a grade B movie star
from California.

00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:37.830
And Jess Unruh, who we
called in, he was the head

00:42:37.830 --> 00:42:40.050
of the California
Democratic Party said,

00:42:40.050 --> 00:42:41.660
"You're underestimating
this guy.

00:42:41.660 --> 00:42:43.400
He's a great politician."

00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:44.970
We didn't realize
how great he was.

00:42:44.970 --> 00:42:49.630
Now what happened was we got
at Fox in terms of the debate.

00:42:49.630 --> 00:42:53.350
We agreed with only eight
days left to debate him.

00:42:53.350 --> 00:42:55.480
And that debate was failed

00:42:55.480 --> 00:42:58.070
because it took away
the fear factor.

00:42:58.070 --> 00:43:01.510
Because we had inflation,
because we had, you know,

00:43:01.510 --> 00:43:04.620
the Iran crisis, all the
good things we had done had

00:43:04.620 --> 00:43:05.920
gone obscured.

00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:08.010
So we ran a very negative
campaign against him.

00:43:08.010 --> 00:43:11.320
And he was very loquacious,
very you know,

00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:13.070
sincere, very articulate.

00:43:13.070 --> 00:43:17.150
It took away the fear factor
and our polls went down.

00:43:17.150 --> 00:43:19.530
But here's the interesting
thing which nobody recognizes

00:43:19.530 --> 00:43:21.240
in this landslide loss.

00:43:21.240 --> 00:43:25.630
The last weekend before
the Tuesday election,

00:43:25.630 --> 00:43:28.570
by all independent polls,
we were even or ahead.

00:43:28.570 --> 00:43:31.950
So the halo effect
that Reagan got

00:43:31.950 --> 00:43:33.650
from the debate had evaporated.

00:43:33.650 --> 00:43:36.070
And then here's where
Iran comes in again.

00:43:36.070 --> 00:43:39.450
We're in Chicago, 3:00 o'clock
in the morning, at the Hilton.

00:43:39.450 --> 00:43:41.870
The White House calls and
says, "Be ready in 45 minutes.

00:43:41.870 --> 00:43:44.060
The President's going
back to the White House.

00:43:44.060 --> 00:43:46.090
There's a new offer
from the Iranians."

00:43:46.090 --> 00:43:47.460
And I begged him not to go.

00:43:47.460 --> 00:43:49.070
I said, "Look, you
can look at it here.

00:43:49.070 --> 00:43:51.450
It's not going to
be satisfactory."

00:43:51.450 --> 00:43:52.750
And it wasn't.

00:43:52.750 --> 00:43:54.050
He went back.

00:43:54.050 --> 00:43:56.340
It brought the whole thing
back, the whole Iranian thing

00:43:56.340 --> 00:43:58.030
and his polls collapsed.

00:43:58.030 --> 00:44:01.560
And all the good things
-- energy security,

00:44:01.560 --> 00:44:03.500
the greatest environmental
president ever,

00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:05.440
all the ethics laws
which were there,

00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:08.460
the modern vice [inaudible]
going to China, normalization,

00:44:08.460 --> 00:44:10.160
human rights and
foreign policy --

00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:13.830
all of these things
were forgotten

00:44:13.830 --> 00:44:15.230
because of the hostage crisis.

00:44:15.230 --> 00:44:16.830
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubinstein: How is
Jimmy Carter's health today?

00:44:16.830 --> 00:44:18.130
&gt;&gt; Stuart Eizenstat:

00:44:18.130 --> 00:44:20.280
Jimmy Carter's health
today is remarkable.

00:44:20.280 --> 00:44:23.430
He's 94 in October, October 1st.

00:44:23.430 --> 00:44:27.610
He announced three years ago
that he had metastatic melanoma.

00:44:27.610 --> 00:44:28.910
We thought it was the end.

00:44:28.910 --> 00:44:30.210
I went down to see him.

00:44:30.210 --> 00:44:33.600
It was a day or two
before he got immunotherapy

00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:35.520
which is a new precision
medicine

00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:38.150
that it's not like chemotherapy.

00:44:38.150 --> 00:44:39.680
It activates the immune system.

00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:43.830
Three years later, knock on
wood, he's as good as ever.

00:44:43.830 --> 00:44:45.130
He travels.

00:44:45.130 --> 00:44:46.430
He's articulate.

00:44:46.430 --> 00:44:48.790
He's been given a
new lease on life

00:44:48.790 --> 00:44:50.940
and it's really a wonderful way

00:44:50.940 --> 00:44:52.350
of [inaudible] blessing
[applause].

00:44:52.350 --> 00:44:54.410
&gt;&gt; David M. Rubinstein:
Well, my --

00:44:54.410 --> 00:44:56.200
we haven't had time for
questions from the audience

00:44:56.200 --> 00:44:57.500
because we ran out of time.

00:44:57.500 --> 00:44:59.400
But I hope you all think this
was an interesting story.

00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:00.700
I highly recommend this book

00:45:00.700 --> 00:45:02.000
by Stuart Eizenstat
on President Carter.

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:03.300
Thank you very much, Stuart.

00:45:03.300 --> 00:45:04.600
&gt;&gt; Stuart Eizenstat:
Thank you, David.

00:45:04.600 --> 00:45:06.200
[ Applause ]
