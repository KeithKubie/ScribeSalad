00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:12.639
The Forgotten Emperor of the United States
and Protector of Mexico, Norton I

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:18.660
His Imperial Majesty Joshua Abraham Norton
I was born between 1811 and 1818 in England.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.130
Records of his birth date vary considerably,
but it’s likely that the latter date is

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:23.199
the correct one.

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:26.669
His family immigrated to South Africa when
he was quite young, where his father headed

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:28.269
a small Jewish community.

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:31.590
As a young man, he initially attempted to
run his own business in Cape Town but quickly

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.540
went bankrupt and started working at his father’s
ship chandlery instead.

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:41.100
By 1848, Emperor Norton had suffered some
severe losses: his mother, father, and both

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.260
of his brothers had died.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:48.769
With no other family, Norton inherited all
$40,000 of his father’s estate and was eager

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:50.390
to search for a new beginning.

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.129
The lure of the American Dream, and the Gold
Rush in particular, drew Norton to San Francisco.

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:58.640
He was eager to find his fortunes, though
he wasn’t interested in mining the gold

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.640
fields; instead, he started a successful merchant
business and rented out space on a ship he’d

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.140
purchased for storage.

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.830
Just a few years after he arrived in San Francisco,
Norton was doing extremely well with assets

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:13.880
estimated to be worth around $250,000 (about
$6.5 million today).

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.299
He had added to his collection of businesses
a cigar factory, a rice mill, and an office

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:19.299
building.

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:21.600
But his good luck didn’t last for long.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.560
A famine in China cut off rice shipments,
sending the price of rice skyrocketing from

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.720
4 to 36 cents per pound.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.790
Norton saw an opportunity to make even more
money when Willy Sillem told him about a ship

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.580
carrying Peruvian rice.

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.530
If purchased, Norton would be able to undercut
the market significantly as he could get the

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.270
shipment of Peruvian rice for just 12.5 cents
per pound, nearly 1/3 the going rate.

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.990
Unfortunately, after putting a $2000 deposit
on a ship load of rice that would cost him

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.750
$25,000 in total, more and more Peruvian ships
carrying rice sailed into harbor.

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.090
The price of rice dropped down to 3 cents
per pound, meaning Norton would not only not

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.620
make a profit, but lose a significant amount
of money in the process.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:04.010
He tried to nullify the contract on the grounds
that Sillem had misled him.

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:08.180
The incident resulted in a two and a half
year court battle with the outcome in Sillem’s

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:11.990
favour—Norton had to pay the remaining $23,000.

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.120
At this point, Norton was near ruin.

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.239
The bank foreclosed on several of his business
and properties, he was no longer able to stay

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:22.459
at ritzy hotels, the social elite wanted nothing
more to do with him, and to top it all off,

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:25.700
he was in court again accused of embezzling
funds from a client.

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.150
By 1859, the once-wealthy merchant who had
it all was living in a working-class boarding

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.210
house, down on his luck and seemingly incapable
of any upward mobility.

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:35.709
But that isn’t the American way.

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:39.540
When you’re living on your last dollar and
have nothing left to lose, what do you do?

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.519
Declare yourself Emperor of the United States,
of course.

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:46.840
You see, Norton had long been critical of
the United States government and was a fan

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.250
of the British Empire.

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.560
He felt like America was run on corruption,
inefficiency, and self-interest, and that

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.470
wasn’t just because of his own losses.

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.670
In 1859, California was caught up in the great
slave debate which would eventually lead to

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.421
the Civil War, and San Francisco’s economy
as a whole wasn’t doing great as the Gold

00:03:02.421 --> 00:03:03.710
Rush died down.

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:07.459
Norton remarked to a friend that things would
be going a lot more smoothly if he was in

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:08.459
charge.

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:13.420
It’s the kind of statement no one expects
to be acted upon, but Norton was a stubborn—if

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.790
unconventional—man and decided to do something
about it.

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:22.200
On September 17, 1859, an unusual story was
published in the San Francisco Bulletin:

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:27.120
At the pre-emptory request of a large majority
of the citizens of these United States, I

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.480
Joshua Norton, formerly of Algoa Bay, Cape
of Good Hope, and now for the last nine years

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:36.680
and ten months past of San Francisco, California,
declare and proclaim myself the Emperor of

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.480
These United States, and in virtue of the
authority thereby in me vested do hereby order

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:46.470
and direct the representatives of the different
States of the Union to assemble in Musical

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.349
Hall of this city, on the 1st day of February
next, then and there to make such alterations

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:55.530
in the existing laws of the Union as may ameliorate
the evils under which the country is laboring,

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:01.390
and thereby cause confidence to exist, both
at home and abroad, in our stability and integrity.

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:04.052
Settlers in the United States colonies did
consider themselves to be part of a type of

00:04:04.052 --> 00:04:08.129
Empire; in San Francisco alone, there were
buildings like the Empire Hotel, the Empire

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:11.420
Brewery, and the Empire Fire Engine Company,
among others.

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.350
However, no one had yet been so bold to declare
themselves Emperor.

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:18.959
It would have been easy enough to fob him
off as a mad man, but the San Francisco Bulletin

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.070
continued to publish his demands and edicts.

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:25.860
Norton I called for the dismantling of congress
and the abolishment of the Supreme Court.

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.860
He fired Virginia Governor Henry A. Wise for
sending John Brown of Harper’s Ferry fame

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.070
to the gallows- Norton was staunchly for equal
rights for all.

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:36.380
But he couldn’t leave Virginia without a
Governor, so he replaced him with John C.

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:40.610
Breckinridge of Kentucky, who was also known
as the Vice President of the United States

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:41.610
at the time.

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:45.950
In 1860, the Congress of the United States
convened against Emperor Norton I’s orders.

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:50.020
In retaliation, he ordered the “Commander
in Chief of the Armies… to clear the hall

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:51.020
of congress.”

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:55.020
The man he was addressing was General Winfield
Scott who had commanded armies fifteen years

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:59.820
before, was now 74 years old, and living in
the Washington Territory rather than Washington

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:00.820
D.C.

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:04.920
That same year, Emperor Norton I declared
the United States an absolute monarchy.

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:08.680
In 1869, he abolished the Democratic and Republican
parties.

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:13.650
Obviously, none of Emperor Norton I’s decrees
ever came to fruition, at least not because

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:23.320
of anything Norton said (later a few of his
ideas would be independently implemented).

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:27.611
As a self-proclaimed Emperor with no armies
or money to back his proclamations up, he

00:05:27.611 --> 00:05:32.230
had no real legal power to create a monarchy,
fire Governors, or dismantle the Supreme Court.

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:36.330
However, oddly enough, he did end up gaining
power of a sort.

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:40.270
Emperor Norton I quickly became a legend and
was extremely popular among the people of

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:41.450
San Francisco.

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:45.670
Politicians were forced to humour him, because
to show him disrespect was to lose votes.

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:50.870
As an example of his popularity, Emperor Norton
I was arrested once, but it wasn’t for conspiracy

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:55.120
to overthrow the government or anything of
the sort; rather, he was picked up for vagrancy

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:57.320
and was later charged with lunacy.

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:01.890
His arrest caused an outcry—newspapers immediately
took to the presses to urge the public to

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:06.850
attend the Emperor’s hearing and protest
the injustice against His Imperial Majesty.

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:11.310
It produced the desired effect: Emperor Norton
I was released with a full apology, and Police

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:15.802
Chief Patrick Crawley ordered all police officers
to salute Emperor Norton I when they passed

00:06:15.802 --> 00:06:19.940
him in the streets, where he could often be
found inspecting the city and socializing

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:21.220
with his subjects.

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:25.070
The Emperor didn’t live exactly like a king,
but his new life did provide a lot of perks

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:29.490
other than salutes from police officers and
a popular name in newspaper stories.

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:32.980
He continued to rent a room in a cheap boarding
house for just 50 cents a night.

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:37.540
His clothes were largely cast-offs from his
loyal subjects, including a few old army uniforms

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:42.050
and a hat that was given to him by a shopkeeper
so that the shop could then be deemed “outfitters

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:43.630
to His Imperial Majesty.”

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:47.870
At a certain point, when his uniform became
too worn, the city of San Francisco saw to

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:52.110
it that he was given a brand new uniform to
wear, as no Emperor of the United States should

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:54.170
go around in shabby clothing.

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:57.930
Besides the free clothes, he was able to ride
on San Francisco’s public transportation

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:01.710
for free, and was even given a free rail pass
in the state of California.

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:06.040
He was also given free meals in several restaurants,
including very upscale establishments where

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:07.870
he was often treated as a VIP guest, though
it’s likely the restaurant owners did that

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:09.140
for publicity rather than out of kindness.

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:12.150
Similarly, when he wished to attend a play,
an opera, or the like, he typically had little

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:17.190
trouble acquiring a box seat for free, and
he was occasionally honored at such shows.

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:20.980
When Emperor Norton I needed a bit of extra
money, he went door-to-door asking businesses

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:24.090
for the “tax” due to him, which many fans
would hand over.

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:27.800
At other times, he simply printed his own
money, which was honored by many businesses

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:29.630
in San Francisco as if it were real currency.

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:30.630
imperial
A $10 note from Emperor Norton

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:34.370
With the completion of the transcontinental
railroad, Emperor Norton I became something

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:35.370
of a tourist attraction.

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:40.770
You are probably thinking, like most people
at the time, that the man was insane, and

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:44.610
that’s probably true—but he was also a
business man through and through.

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:47.980
The Emperor talked to anyone who wanted to
meet him and also occasionally used some of

00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:51.400
his self-made “promissory notes” to trade
with tourists in exchange for U.S. currency,

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:55.150
with his notes to be repaid with 7% interest
in 1880.

00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:58.640
Obviously, no one thought to collect, as they
really just wanted the Emperor’s signature

00:07:58.640 --> 00:07:59.680
to take back with them as a souvenir.

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:02.980
Similarly, various businesses were making
significant amounts of money selling Emperor

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:06.650
Norton I souvenirs, from post cards to dolls
to cigars.

00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:12.590
They also put up signs in their windows that
said “By Appointment of Emperor Norton I.”

00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:15.790
This nearly homeless man quickly became a
national hero.

00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:19.690
Besides inspecting the city, dolling out various
decrees, and engaging anyone who would talk

00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:24.450
to him in philosophical debates, his Imperial
Majesty once managed to do the near impossible-

00:08:24.450 --> 00:08:26.730
stop a mob in their tracks.

00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:30.920
While the details of the act have likely been
blown out of proportion over time, at one

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:33.990
point a very small mob was attempting to attack
a Chinese immigrant (more fanciful versions

00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:34.990
of the story have him standing between a huge
crowd of rioters, barring their entry into

00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:35.990
Chinatown- doing his best impression of the
future character of Gandalf against the Balrog

00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:36.990
on the Bridge of Khazad-dûm).

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:38.091
Not to be one to let such shenanigans take
place in his country, Emperor Norton I set

00:08:38.091 --> 00:08:40.659
himself between the Chinese man and the attackers.

00:08:40.659 --> 00:08:44.610
Whether it was due to his own popularity in
the town or because he supposedly yelled out

00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:49.100
the Lord’s Prayer repeatedly in the attacker’s
faces, the immigrant was saved and the small

00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:50.100
mob dispersed.

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:54.590
Unfortunately, after 21 years ruling these
United States and later also protecting Mexico,

00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:59.080
on a sad day in January of 1880, the Emperor
suddenly fell to the sidewalk during his evening

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:00.080
walk.

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:01.980
He died before he could be taken to hospital.

00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:06.110
The Pacific Club of San Francisco set about
raising funds for a proper high end rosewood

00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:10.530
casket, as well as to cover other funeral
expenses for Norton, who died nearly penniless,

00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:13.010
having chosen to never overtax his subjects.

00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:15.120
His death was lamented throughout the land.

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:18.510
Around 10,000 people paid their respects at
his funeral, with some newspaper accounts

00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:23.440
claiming as many as 30,000 people, about 13%
of the population of San Francisco at the

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:28.030
time, lined the streets for the two mile procession
to his grave site; newspapers across the country

00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:29.890
reported the death of the emperor.

00:09:29.890 --> 00:09:34.530
One newspaper, The Alta California, even dedicated
34 inches of print celebrating the life of

00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:35.530
the Emperor.

00:09:35.530 --> 00:09:39.950
On the same day it printed just 38 words from
the new Governor of California’s inaugural

00:09:39.950 --> 00:09:52.240
speech.
