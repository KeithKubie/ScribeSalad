Let's start with a slightly more complicated equation. 3 x plus 4 equals 2 x

00:00:05.136 --> 00:00:10.296
minus 1. Just like I asked you before, if I want to find the solution to this

00:00:10.308 --> 00:00:15.703
equation through drawing two lines that intersect one another in order to find

00:00:15.715 --> 00:00:19.008
this value of x from their point of intersection.
