carbohydrate diet which is what Adkins

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390
carbohydrate diet which is what Adkins
 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.479
carbohydrate diet which is what Adkins
is I mentioned it is a prototypical high

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489
is I mentioned it is a prototypical high
 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.790
is I mentioned it is a prototypical high
protein diet but ultimately you have to

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800
protein diet but ultimately you have to
 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.680
protein diet but ultimately you have to
transition off most of these diets that

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690
transition off most of these diets that
 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.600
transition off most of these diets that
are radical to something else you can

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610
are radical to something else you can
 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.639
are radical to something else you can
lose weight on the cabbage soup diet but

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649
lose weight on the cabbage soup diet but
 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.319
lose weight on the cabbage soup diet but
you can't stay on that for life and the

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329
you can't stay on that for life and the
 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.209
you can't stay on that for life and the
problem is you got to live it not just

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219
problem is you got to live it not just
 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.100
problem is you got to live it not just
diet it and you have to have that

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110
diet it and you have to have that
 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.390
diet it and you have to have that
transition plan and the problem with

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400
transition plan and the problem with
 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.130
transition plan and the problem with
that consists when you put carbs back in

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140
that consists when you put carbs back in
 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.039
that consists when you put carbs back in
that same problem exists but if you do

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049
that same problem exists but if you do
 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.830
that same problem exists but if you do
it carefully low glycemic carbs balance

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840
it carefully low glycemic carbs balance
 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.210
it carefully low glycemic carbs balance
it in with the fats and the proteins you

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220
it in with the fats and the proteins you
 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.679
it in with the fats and the proteins you
end up on something that's similar to

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689
end up on something that's similar to
 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.120
end up on something that's similar to
some of these other middle-of-the-road

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130
some of these other middle-of-the-road
 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.060
some of these other middle-of-the-road
diets low glycemic index relatively high

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070
diets low glycemic index relatively high
 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.640
diets low glycemic index relatively high
protein careful fat intake and that's

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650
protein careful fat intake and that's
 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:32.670
protein careful fat intake and that's
really really gonna be

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:32.680
 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.510
well that's what we're talking about a

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520
well that's what we're talking about a
 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.030
well that's what we're talking about a
bit is low carbohydrate low glycemic

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040
bit is low carbohydrate low glycemic
 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.950
bit is low carbohydrate low glycemic
index carbohydrates and those are the

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960
index carbohydrates and those are the
 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.270
index carbohydrates and those are the
healthier ones they're the ones that get

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280
healthier ones they're the ones that get
 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.920
healthier ones they're the ones that get
digested more slowly they tend to be

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:41.930
digested more slowly they tend to be
 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.790
digested more slowly they tend to be
less processed so pastas white breads

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:45.800
less processed so pastas white breads
 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.100
less processed so pastas white breads
things like that are the bad carbs if

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110
things like that are the bad carbs if
 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.770
things like that are the bad carbs if
you will as opposed to whole grains you

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780
you will as opposed to whole grains you
 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.440
you will as opposed to whole grains you
know interestingly processed oats get

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450
know interestingly processed oats get
 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.780
know interestingly processed oats get
digested very rapidly and a high

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790
digested very rapidly and a high
 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.240
digested very rapidly and a high
glycemic index but steel-cut oats which

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250
glycemic index but steel-cut oats which
 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:59.760
glycemic index but steel-cut oats which
are whole oats that have to be cooked

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770
are whole oats that have to be cooked
 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.350
are whole oats that have to be cooked
those get digested much more slowly and

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360
those get digested much more slowly and
 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.719
those get digested much more slowly and
our low glycemic index food so it really

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729
our low glycemic index food so it really
 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:06.370
our low glycemic index food so it really
sometimes how the foods even prepared

wild rice instead of white rice I

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:08.570
wild rice instead of white rice I
 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:10.540
wild rice instead of white rice I
mentioned whole grains sweet potatoes

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550
mentioned whole grains sweet potatoes
 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.330

completely also some research has shown
 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.270
completely also some research has shown
that high volumes of food tend to make
