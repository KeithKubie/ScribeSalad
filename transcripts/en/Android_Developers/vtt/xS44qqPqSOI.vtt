&gt;&gt; One thing I like about Android is that
it enables you to build one application that

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:09.530
can adjust itself dynamically to different
devices. So, and this is possible because

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:14.090
the UI is created in XML and the resources
of the UI layouts are packaged in a very smart

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:20.839
way. So when you inflate the UIs from XML,
the runtime itself, the platform itself choose

00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:26.179
the best layout for different screens. So,
in that way, you can create only one application

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:31.319
package that will actually adjust itself for
different screen sizes, different color depths,

00:00:31.319 --> 00:00:37.120
or just different devices. One thing I would
like to see on Android is support for Java

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:44.670
Native Interface in order to run some processor
specific tasks in the platform native language.

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.629
So, in our case, for Shazam, we create the
fingerprints. But for right now, we--for our

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:54.699
library to create fingerprints is done--is
we use it on the service side. Having the

00:00:54.699 --> 00:01:00.129
JNI will enable us to make the fingerprints
of the phone and send the latest data to the

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:00.469
servers.
