00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.170
When I first came to Georgia Tech, David Harel came and gave a talk.

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:08.980
And, as in the paper, in the talk, he talked about his digital watch.

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:12.810
And he presented a model of the digital watch.

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:17.870
He, he in fact had used that as a way of stressing his diagramming technique to

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:24.130
see if it was capable of representing the features of the, of the digital watch.

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:25.141
&gt;From the paper, here's,

00:00:25.141 --> 00:00:29.540
here's the example of the digital watch, from a high level view.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.900
Notice that there are really two states here.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.220
One is the dead state and one is the alive state,

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.820
separated by whether the battery is placed inside it or so on.

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:48.240
And then are five concurrently executing sub machines inside the alive state,

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:52.530
each of which has their own activities going, going on, and

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.780
there's even further nesting down in the lower right-hand concurrent machine.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.630
The fact that state chargts support nesting means you can pull out any of

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:07.130
these sub-machines and consider them independently.

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.920
You can even provide details in the pulled out version that weren't visible in

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:12.840
the top level version.

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.450
Here's an example of the stop watch state.

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.360
It makes use of a history state.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.520
You'll notice there it had it's own default state for

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.590
the, for the stopwatch itself in the zero step.

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.470
There's also a guarded transition using the in keyword that I mentioned before.

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:32.730
Here's a pullout on the displays state.

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:35.880
Notice that the state itself has a self transition over on

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.140
the left that indicates that there's a two minute timer.

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.520
What this is saying is if you were in one of the display states,

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.880
other than the default state, after two minutes it will,

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.010
it will flip back unless you were in the stopwatch state,

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.040
in which case it'll keep, keep you looking at the stopwatch.
