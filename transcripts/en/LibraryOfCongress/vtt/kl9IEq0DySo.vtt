00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:04.700
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress, in Washington, DC.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:19.560
&gt;&gt; Sy Damle: Good morning everyone.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.130
Welcome to the first of two
round table hearings on the topic

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.310
of copyright law as it relates to
software-enabled consumer products.

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.610
I'm Sy Damle.

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:30.420
I'm Deputy General Counsel
of the copyright office,

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.670
and I'll let my colleagues
introduce themselves.

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:34.640
Catherine Rowland:
I'm Kitty Rowland.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.910
I'm senior advisor to the register.

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:39.490
&gt;&gt; John Riley: I'm John
Riley, attorney advisor.

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:43.150
&gt;&gt; Michelle Choe: I'm
Michelle Choe, ringer fellow.

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.730
&gt;&gt; Sy Damle: So I'll
just do a quick intro,

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:48.720
and then we can start
with the first panel.

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.790
So in October 2015, the Senate
Judiciary Committee asked the

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.340
copyright office to study copyright
issues related to the spread

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.260
of software in what it
called everyday products.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.990
And in its letter,
the committee observed

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:03.570
that digital technologies
have revolutionized our world

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.490
and that copyrighted software is
now essential to the operation

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.300
of our refrigerators, our
cars, our family equipment,

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.040
our wireless phones, and virtually
any other device you can think of.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.180
While crediting our
intellectual property laws

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.120
for these developments,
the committee noted

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:18.580
that questions are being asked

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.110
about how consumers can
lawfully use products

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.410
that rely on software to function.

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:26.040
The committee directed us to
undertake a comprehensive review

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.120
of the role of copyright in this
area while acknowledging that many

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.280
of these issues may relate to
areas outside of copyright law.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.940
So first of all, I'd like to thank
the committee for this assignment

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.990
and for its recognition of the
office's longstanding interest

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.580
in expertise in the intersection
of copyright law and technology.

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.230
Second, I'd like to thank all
of the groups and individuals

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:49.790
that submitted written comments in
response to our notice of inquiry.

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.070
We reviewed them all carefully,
and they were very helpful

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.230 position:56%
in identifying the issues before us.

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:58.130
And third, I'd like to thank all
of you who agreed to participate

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:03.720
in this round table to help us take
a deeper dive into these issues.

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.870
So some of you are
veterans of our round table,

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:08.890
so you know how this works, but
for the others, if you want to jump

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.190
in on the conversation, just
turn your table tent upright,

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.910
and we'll call on you
hopefully in some fair order.

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.710
And just an explanation
of the microphones.

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:24.170 position:56%
In order to speak, you have to
press the button, the silver button,

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.220
and the light will
turn red when it's on.

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.030
Only four people at once can have
their lights, the microphones on,

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.330
so after you're done talking,

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.780
if you could just please turn
your mic off, that would be great.

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.550
And just a disclaimer that
your remarks are being recorded

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.790
and will be transcribed made part
of the public record and available

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.440
on the copyright office website,

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.530
and the panel obviously
is being videotaped,

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.000
and the video will be
made available as well.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.430
So we've got four panels
lined up today,

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.320
three before lunch
and one after lunch.

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.220
And there'll be an opportunity
for observer comments at the end,

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.750
and I hope we'll have a
productive conversation today.

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.940
Our first panel is about
a fairly general topic.

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.960
It's the proper role of copyright

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.780
in protecting software-enabled
consumer products,

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.190
and the goal of the panel is
to explore over-arching issues

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.470
like the need for copyright
protection in embedded software,

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.050
whether software in everyday
products can be distinguished

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:22.970
from other types of software, and
the need for interoperability.

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:27.220 position:56%
But before I start off with a
question, we'd appreciate it if each

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.140
of you could introduce yourself

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.920
and explain your affiliation
for the record.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.180
So we'll start with you.

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:35.950
&gt;&gt; Shaun J. Bockert: Hi, I'm
Shaun Bockert, of Blank Rome,

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.620
and I'm here representing
Doorman [phonetic] Products, Inc.,

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.360
a supplier of new and
remanufactured automotive parts.

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.600
&gt;&gt; Christian Troncoso: Hi,
I'm Christian Troncoso.

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.880
I'm here representing BSA,
The Software Alliance.

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:52.330
&gt;&gt; John Bergmayer:
I'm John Bergmayer,

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:54.500
and I'm here for Public Knowledge.

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.070
&gt;&gt; Ben Golant: Hi, Ben Golant,

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:58.860
representing the Entertainment
Software Association,

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:02.110
represents computer and
video game industry.

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:04.720 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Band: I'm Jonathan Band.

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.280
I'm here on behalf of the
Owner's Rights Initiative.

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.190
&gt;&gt; Keith Kupferschmid:
Keith Kupferschmid,

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:11.900
the CEO of the Copyright Alliance.

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:17.270
We represent 15,000
organizations and individuals

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:21.990
who copyright is very,
very important to.

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:24.530
&gt;&gt; Aaron Lowe: Aaron Lowe, I'm
with the Auto Care Association.

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:27.210
We represent manufacturers,
distributors, retailers,

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.560
and installers of automotive
parts independent

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.560
of the vehicle manufacturers.

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.020
&gt;&gt; Steve Tepp: Steve Tepp,

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:36.430
representing the Global
Intellectual Property Center

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:40.370
of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:41.670
&gt;&gt; Chris Mohr: Chris Mohr, Software

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:44.200
and Information Industry
Association.

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:48.270
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Zuck: Jonathan Zuck
from ACT, The App Association.

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:49.640
&gt;&gt; Sy Damle: Great.

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:51.470
Well thanks very much.

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:53.810
So to start things off,
the committee asked us

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:57.530 position:56%
to examine the specific issue of
copyright issues related to software

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:59.950
in what they called
everyday products.

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:02.340
And we understand the
committee to have not asked us

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:06.570
for a more comprehensive review of
copyright and software generally.

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:10.070
So with that understanding, I
think that raises a key issue here,

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:13.760 position:56%
which is whether there are problems
in the marketplace that are specific

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.330
to software-enabled
consumer devices and if

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.850
so whether those problems
can be solved

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:20.940
without affecting copyright
protection

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:22.320
for software more generally.

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:27.400
So, to sort of open up, if anyone
wants to comment on that issue,

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.950
just tip your table tent up.

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:34.480
Mr. Band?

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:35.990
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Band: So
I think it's easy

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:42.420
to distinguish software generally
from software that is embedded

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:47.910
in products, and I, you
know, it's should be possible

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:53.750
to craft special rules for the
software embedded in products

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:58.780
without necessarily
implicating software generally.

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:01.920
Where you're going to have
definitional issues is

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:06.580
like what does it mean to
be embedded or sort of,

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:09.290
you know software-enabled
product, I mean that becomes a bit

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:12.190
of a definitional issue because
sometimes you're talking about,

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:17.770 position:56%
you might be talking about
firmware, or you might be, you know,

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:24.730 position:56%
where really it is fixed, but you
also might be talking about programs

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:29.790
where you, you know, devices where
you have to download the programs

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:32.040
or the user has to
install the software

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:33.690
in some way to make it work.

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:38.510
So that becomes a bit
of a trickier issue.

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:41.280
And then the other issue that
you need to decide is to sort

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:43.800
of distinguish between,
you know, everyday products

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:46.900
or consumer products
and other products.

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:48.720
[Inaudible] that's helpful to
distinguish, and I think in,

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:54.400
you know, in 2016, where, you
know, there's really no difference

00:06:54.400 --> 00:07:01.240
between business uses,
consumer uses, private uses,

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:06.170
and it's not very helpful to
try to make that distinction,

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:08.930
inevitably a very artificial one.

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:11.760
&gt;&gt; Sy Damle: And in terms of
problems that you see specifically

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:15.290
with respect to, I mean,
sort of the premises

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:18.370
of the question was whether there
are problems that are specific

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:21.910
to consumer devices or
whether the problems are really

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:24.920
about software at large.

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:28.090
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Band: Well, I
would say that they are,

00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:31.610
there are a specific set
of issues that we know now.

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:34.640
Certainly, you know, and
we'll be getting into it more

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:37.780
in later panels, but the whole
first sale, there's the ability

00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:42.510
to transfer products, you know, the
kinds of things that we've talked

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:48.010 position:56%
about in our comments, and I know
some of the other people have talked

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:52.260
about it, but, you know,
the ability to sell devices,

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:58.020
repair devices, and
customize devices.

00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:01.360
I mean those kinds of things
that are sort of unique

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:07.350 position:56%
to when you have the software in the
device, there are things you want

00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:09.420
to do with the device that are,

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:11.400
you don't really care
about the software.

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:15.320
I mean the software just
happens to be there.

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:17.310
&gt;&gt; Sy Damle: So I'm
not sure exactly,

00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:19.240
I think it was you,
Mr. Troncoso, yeah.

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:23.180
&gt;&gt; Christian Troncoso: I'd like
to just pick up on both the points

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:26.340
that Jonathan raised, both in
regards to sort of the distinction

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:29.410
between consumer devices
and everyday devices,

00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:30.890
and devices that are not every day.

00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:35.310
And then on the embedded software
issue, I think that we agree

00:08:35.310 --> 00:08:38.640
on the first point with I think
the vast majority of commenters

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:41.010 position:56%
that sort of distinguishing a device

00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:45.580
as an everyday device is not a
particularly helpful designation

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:49.240
because it's just a category that's
going to be constantly evolving.

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:52.480
Technology, you know, ten years
ago we would never have imagined,

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:56.300
I think, the phones in our pockets
now have the computing power

00:08:56.300 --> 00:09:00.130
that sort of exceeds that
which NASA used to land people

00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:01.430
on the moon in the '60's.

00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:04.460
So, I don't think that's
a helpful classification.

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:08.460
And then on the embedded software
classification, we don't think

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:12.100
that that's particularly useful
either because, you know,

00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:15.360
we've had embedded software for
decades, but I think the problems

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:20.300
that people are identifying that
gave rise to this study relate

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:21.890
to the newer products, right.

00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:24.670
We're not talking about
calculators or microwaves.

00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:27.240
We're talking about the newer
classification of products

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:31.100
that are sort of internet
connected at all times,

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:34.610
the sort of the examples that came
up a lot in folks comments relate

00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:38.350
to things like nest [phonetic],
and the issue there is not sort

00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:43.280
of the embedded software, it's
that the software has a server sort

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:48.940
of interaction, and that the
software is more of a service

00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:51.690
than sort of just mere
embedded software.

00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:55.040
So the issues that people are
concerned about and rightly

00:09:55.040 --> 00:10:00.310 position:56%
so relate to how, you know, people's
relationships with these devices

00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:04.350
that involve a continuous sort
of interaction with servers.

00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:09.860
So I think sort of trying to narrow
the scope of this inquiry merely

00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:13.830
to embedded software, I don't think
is particularly helpful either.

00:10:13.830 --> 00:10:15.130
&gt;&gt; Sy Damle: So can I ask about--

00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:16.460
so, I mean there's the one area

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:20.190
where the law arguably
draws a distinction is

00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:23.000
in the computer rental amendments
act where it says, you know,

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.370
a computer program, which
is embodied in a machine,

00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:28.720
which cannot be copied, and if you
look at the legislative history,

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:31.630
and we had a follow-on study,
you know, what they were talking

00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:34.360
about were, I think, some
of the examples that were

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:39.350
in the senate letter, which were
automobiles, like those kinds

00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:42.120
of consumer devices, calculators
I think with a mentioned,

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:43.950
which you mentioned as well.

00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:49.690
Is that a viable distinction that
we could use if were hypothetically

00:10:49.690 --> 00:10:53.640
to try to draw a distinction for
embedded software as you point

00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:56.940
that that distinction that's in
the law now really doesn't work

00:10:56.940 --> 00:10:59.530
to solve the problems that
anyone has identified.

00:10:59.530 --> 00:11:00.970
&gt;&gt; Christian Troncoso:
Well I think my point is

00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:04.240
that you know I'm not really sure
what problem specifically it is

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:05.870
that we're trying to address.

00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:09.520
And sort of merely, you
know, there's been a lot of,

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:13.450 position:56%
sort of people have focused a lot on
the issue of licensing of software

00:11:13.450 --> 00:11:16.180
and sort of, you know, a lot of
the software that is embedded

00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:20.330
on our consumer devices now
is transferred by a mechanism

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:22.910
of a license as opposed to a sale.

00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:26.100
That I think is probably a little
bit different than what happened,

00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:30.860
you know, when microwaves first
came onto the market in the '70s.

00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:35.590
So my point is that I think it's
very hard to address these issues

00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:40.670
without disrupting the overall
market for software at large.

00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:45.010
&gt;&gt; Sy Damle: A lot of people have
their tents up, and I'm not--

[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:50.550
Okay, Mr. Lowe.

00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:51.850
Thanks.

00:11:51.850 --> 00:11:55.290
&gt;&gt; Aaron Lowe: So representing
the automotive parts area,

00:11:55.290 --> 00:12:00.720
we've had a long history
of experience in patent law

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:04.220
with reversed engineering
parts, remanufacturing parts,

00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:12.240
but the issue of copyright has
arisen in a much greater amount

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:17.270 position:56%
because of the fact that software is
on almost all automotive parts now

00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:21.000
that are being built into the
parts by the vehicle manufacturer,

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.470
which we think current
copyright law, you know,

00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:28.530 position:56%
does provide the ability to do that,
but the need for clarification,

00:12:28.530 --> 00:12:31.440
because there are a lot of issues
when you're remanufacturing parts,

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:36.740
where software needs to be used, we
need to, we look at software more

00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:40.800
as an automotive part or
function rather than the actual,

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:42.750
you know, any creative thing.

00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:47.570
So, like a windshield wiper might
have a software embedded into it.

00:12:47.570 --> 00:12:50.320
It's taking the case
of a mechanical part

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:52.190
that would have been
on there before.

00:12:52.190 --> 00:12:58.220
So we look at the whole issue
of software as being, you know,

00:12:58.220 --> 00:13:01.850
very close to being
to an item that you,

00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:04.280
mechanical you could
reverse engineer, copy,

00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:09.630
and use again to put on, to
make a copy of that part.

00:13:09.630 --> 00:13:13.300
And I think there's a lot
of concern in our industry

00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:17.770
because we're no longer, you know,
the vehicle manufacturers seem

00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:22.610 position:56%
to view this in different light,
and I think that's created a lot of,

00:13:22.610 --> 00:13:26.060
maybe misconceptions and
concerns in our industry,

00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:29.920
and also has generated lawsuits in
our industry of our manufacturers.

00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:32.970 position:56%
So we really think our industry
needs a lot of clarification of some

00:13:32.970 --> 00:13:37.000
of these issues because they
are creating problems for those

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.890
that reverse engineer and build
competitive parts and those

00:13:39.890 --> 00:13:42.580
who do service on vehicles.

00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:44.760
&gt;&gt; Sy Damle: So you mentioned
lawsuits, and you also mentioned it

00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:46.060
in your written comments.

00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:49.070
I mean, can you explain exactly
what those lawsuits involve,

00:13:49.070 --> 00:13:50.830
whether they involve-- so I know

00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:53.050
that there's the Al-Tel
[phonetic] litigation going on,

00:13:53.050 --> 00:13:56.720
which really is not
directly about the software.

00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:01.630 position:56%
It's really about the, I think it's
the data compilation case basically.

00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:06.800 position:56%
So can you just sort of explain
what kind of litigation is going on?

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:09.590
&gt;&gt; Aaron Lowe: Well, you know, I
can, we have representatives here

00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:10.890
that are involved in that.

00:14:10.890 --> 00:14:13.830
I can let them answer that
question maybe more specifically,

00:14:13.830 --> 00:14:20.320 position:56%
but they involve the use of software
on an aftermarket part used on a car

00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:23.030
and whether they had the ability
to, you know, because they needed

00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:27.380
to use software to integrate with
that vehicle, you had to copy it

00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:30.700
to do that, and I think that
specifically is more of the issue,

00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:33.840
but we can let someone, you
know, another representative talk

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:35.680
about that more specifically.

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:38.600
But that's the concern of
being able to use software

00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:41.810
to make sure it's interoperable
with a vehicle part,

00:14:41.810 --> 00:14:45.640
and sometimes you have to copy
it to make sure it does that.

00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:47.830 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Sy Damle: And is it your view, I
mean, you mentioned at the beginning

00:14:47.830 --> 00:14:52.940
that you thought the current
copyright doctrine could have

00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:55.270
addressed those but that you
wanted clarification on that.

00:14:55.270 --> 00:14:56.970
&gt;&gt; Aaron Lowe: I think there
needs to be more clarification

00:14:56.970 --> 00:15:02.420
as how it relates to the
aftermarket and replacement parts,

00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:05.070
reverse engineering, and also
servicing of vehicles too.

00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:06.880
&gt;&gt; Catherine Rowland: Can I ask

00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:10.580
if you have a recommendation
for this clarification?

00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:13.700
&gt;&gt; Aaron Lowe: I think we had it
in our testimony that we submitted.

00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:16.480
I think just clarification about
the use, and I think we'll get

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:18.380
into a lot of these issues
a little bit more closely

00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:21.710
when we delve deeper
into it, but, you know,

00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:27.130
the ability to copy the
software to use it as,

00:15:27.130 --> 00:15:31.360
if it's a noncopyrightable,
it's just a functional issue,

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:35.510
interoperability, issues like that.

&gt;&gt; Jonathan Zuck: Thanks.

00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:48.830
And thanks for having me
here for this discussion.

00:15:48.830 --> 00:15:53.200
I guess I just want to start
by saying that, you know,

00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:56.040
as a former software developer
and now a representative

00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:57.340
of software developers,

00:15:57.340 --> 00:16:00.160
that software is the
thing in a lot of ways.

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:05.330 position:56%
And I think it's easy to forget that
the huge strides and innovations

00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:09.780 position:56%
in computing have come predominantly
in software and that if you look

00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:13.500
at something like a big
sensor, like a radio array,

00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:15.770 position:56%
and you look at Seti [phonetic], the
only reason we're going to be able

00:16:15.770 --> 00:16:19.160
to filter the potential
for, you know,

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:22.210
extraterrestrial intelligence
is because of software.

00:16:22.210 --> 00:16:24.930
You know, just imagine if you
had that functionality on C-Span,

00:16:24.930 --> 00:16:26.780
it would be a lot easier to watch.

00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:32.580
But so innovation in CAT scans
and a lot of machines come

00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:35.670
through software, and software
is regularly updated regardless

00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:37.670
of what your definition
is of embedded.

00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:42.210
I mean it is a live and dynamic
part of the software and central

00:16:42.210 --> 00:16:44.220
to the incredible advance

00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:47.220
in software has been
copyright protection.

00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:50.910 position:56%
It has created incentives to invest,
etc., and if you change them,

00:16:50.910 --> 00:16:53.120
you will change those
incentives, I think,

00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:56.380
and so you will change
artificially the way

00:16:56.380 --> 00:16:59.460
that people implement their
technology in order to find ways

00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:01.660
to get protection for what
they're doing as opposed

00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:03.700 position:56%
to actually creating more innovation

00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:06.680
in a space that's already
highly innovative.

00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:09.840
I represent, you know, app makers,

00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:12.840
and increasingly apps
are finding their way

00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:17.790
into devices whether it's scales
or cars or refrigerators, etc.,

00:17:17.790 --> 00:17:21.520
and that innovation, I think,
is going to be critical,

00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:25.520
and I think that making a
distinction between everyday use,

00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:28.340
I agree is a very specious one.

00:17:28.340 --> 00:17:31.410
I mean, very critical
sensors are in, you know,

00:17:31.410 --> 00:17:35.750
thing like Apple watches
and Microsoft band, etc.,

00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:37.970
and that's going to be something
somebody uses every day,

00:17:37.970 --> 00:17:40.070
and yet those are health related.

00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:43.130
So I think there's a
real incentives problem,

00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:48.440
and I think ultimately you're
going to start to see a problem

00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:51.720
around liability too that,
you know, I've guaranteed

00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:54.200
to protect somebody's
data in a particular way,

00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:56.870
and my software is going to
be critical to doing that.

00:17:56.870 --> 00:18:01.970
I'm making assertions about the
accuracy of a particular device,

00:18:01.970 --> 00:18:04.030 position:56%
and software is going to be critical

00:18:04.030 --> 00:18:08.500
to making those assertions
real or not.

00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:12.860
Compatibility and fragmentation
of underlying technology.

00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:16.100
I mean I'm an avid
photographer, and the firmware

00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:19.310
of my camera is constantly
being updated for compatibility

00:18:19.310 --> 00:18:23.120 position:56%
with different lenses and things
like that, and yet there are efforts

00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:27.330
to hack camera firmware, to
add functionality in parallel,

00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:30.050
and if you do those things, you
sort of do them at your own risk

00:18:30.050 --> 00:18:33.880 position:56%
because you're now out of the branch
of the enhancements that are coming

00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:35.180
from the manufacturer

00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:36.810
for the different hardware
that you wanted to use.

00:18:36.810 --> 00:18:40.130
And so then it raises questions
about, you know, who do you call

00:18:40.130 --> 00:18:45.690
when your camera bricks up
because you've fiddled with it.

00:18:45.690 --> 00:18:50.090
And I think that, I think all of
that is important to keep in mind

00:18:50.090 --> 00:18:52.180
as context for the discussion.

00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:54.660
Getting to specifics, I fail to see

00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:57.520
that there's been any real problem
that's been identified here that's

00:18:57.520 --> 00:19:00.020
specific to software
embedded in devices.

00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:01.320
It's all theoretical.

00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:02.840
It doesn't seem to be real,

00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:06.520
and I think that the copyright
system has provided a set of kind

00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:07.820
of release valves already.

00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:11.490
There's exceptions built into
things like the DMCA, etc.,

00:19:11.490 --> 00:19:15.000
that are specifically designed
for interoperability and study,

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:20.020
security, etc., that have been
used effectively and to the extent

00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:23.700
to which there have been court
cases around software being used

00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:25.640
and copyright being used
sort of illegitimately.

00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:27.620
They've sort of fallen
the way I think

00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:29.110
that people believe
they should have.

00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:31.350
So it seems to me that it's
a system that's working

00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:34.320
and that there's no sign
of a systemic problem.

00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:36.490
Instead, there's a
system that works,

00:19:36.490 --> 00:19:40.730
and we ought to be very
cautious about changing it.

&gt;&gt; Sy Damle: Thank you, Mr. Zuck.

00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:46.510
I think we'll go down this
line and then come back.

00:19:46.510 --> 00:19:47.810
How about that?

00:19:47.810 --> 00:19:49.250

it's a pleasure being back here

being part of this conversation.

00:19:55.840 --> 00:20:00.930

Christian and Jonathan have said.

00:20:00.930 --> 00:20:04.310
I agree with their assessments
of the current environment,

00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:08.990
and I think the broad point I want
to make is at first do not harm

00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:10.580
to the copyright protection system

00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:12.650
for software under
the copyright act.

00:20:12.650 --> 00:20:17.160
That should be the ultimate
goal of this particular study.

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:21.090
And in terms of how you
differentiate, I think in terms

00:20:21.090 --> 00:20:25.760
of what ESA members care
about, whether it be console,

00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:30.090
manufacturers, or hand-held
devices or even the new VR,

00:20:30.090 --> 00:20:35.190
virtual reality units, every
piece of software has a function,

00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:38.680
and you can't differentiate one
kind of software versus another

00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:41.180
because they all interoperate,
they all link together,

00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:45.750 position:56%
they all make that device that makes
all our consumers very, very happy.

00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:48.090
So there can't be any line drawing

00:20:48.090 --> 00:20:50.980
because that would be
regulatory chaos to say this kind

00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:54.000
of software is not
protected or this kind

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.820
of software should be
treated differently.

00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:59.330
So the bottom line is whatever
our members care about,

00:20:59.330 --> 00:21:02.660
and that is having an integrated
unit that makes things go

00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:07.140
and makes the games go, that's
how we should like to maintain it,

00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:11.920
just keep the protections under the
act for software the way they are.

00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:13.940
&gt;&gt; Sy Damle: And what's your
view of the line that's drawn

00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:15.530
in the computer rental
amendments act.

00:21:15.530 --> 00:21:20.520
Is that, I mean obviously that's
about a very specific issue, but,

00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:22.530
you know, there's both an exception

00:21:22.530 --> 00:21:27.140
for what they say computer
program embodied in the machine

00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:29.180
that can't be copied, and then
there's a separate one actually

00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:32.820
for video games that are also
embodied and can't be copied, so--

00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:34.120
&gt;&gt; Ben Golant: Right.

00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:35.420
And I know exactly what you're
talking about, but I can talk

00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:36.720
about that a little bit later,

00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:39.630
but right now I'll keep
the statements I just made.

00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:40.930
&gt;&gt; Sy Damle: Okay.

00:21:40.930 --> 00:21:42.570
Mr. Bergmayer?

00:21:42.570 --> 00:21:43.870
&gt;&gt; John Bergmayer: Yeah, thank you.

00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:45.550
I think underlying the use

00:21:45.550 --> 00:21:48.900
of the phrase everyday products
is this notion that, you know,

00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:52.050
consumer products are different
than say large scale commercial,

00:21:52.050 --> 00:21:54.580
industrial, agricultural users

00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:57.280
and that consumers have
particular expectations and rights

00:21:57.280 --> 00:22:00.480
and protections that might not
apply to a factory buying a bunch

00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:03.920
of software-controlled CNC
machinery or something.

00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:07.560
And I think that's probably
totally true; however,

00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:10.210
I don't think that
copyright law is the right way

00:22:10.210 --> 00:22:12.710
to draw those distinctions
between classes of users.

00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:16.240
You already have contract law,
already makes distinctions

00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:19.900
between sophisticated
users and commercial users.

00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:21.850
I'm not an expert in this
commercial law stuff,

00:22:21.850 --> 00:22:25.270
but I'm pretty sure the
UCC or something makes note

00:22:25.270 --> 00:22:27.860
of those different classes,
and particularly, you know,

00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:29.560
from a consumer group perspective,

00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:33.310
something that concerns me is
the notion of using licenses

00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:37.590
to disclaim liability for
defects and products just

00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:40.660 position:56%
because they're software and you can
condition a software license on it

00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:43.810
where you couldn't with other
ordinary consumer products.

00:22:43.810 --> 00:22:47.560 position:56%
And I think, you know, consumer law
already deals with things like that.

00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:49.860
You know, a lot of states
have rules which say

00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:53.220
that no matter how many times a
manufacturer of a product tries

00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:55.810
to disclaim a warranty,
it's ineffective.

00:22:55.810 --> 00:22:58.530
They have certain liabilities
that are defined by law,

00:22:58.530 --> 00:23:00.500
and there's no getting around them.

00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:02.610
Yet those protections
typically wouldn't apply

00:23:02.610 --> 00:23:06.320
to a sophisticated commercial
buyer of industrial machinery,

00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:09.440
and I think that's a totally
appropriate distinction to draw,

00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:12.680
and it's not really necessary for
a copyright law to even be a part

00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:15.130
of that discussion of how
do you protect consumers

00:23:15.130 --> 00:23:17.240
versus how do you not
protect consumers,

00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:20.840
and my concern is the potential
use of copyright law to try to,

00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:22.740
you know, whittle away
some of those rights

00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:26.140
where software vendors
typically disclaim all liability

00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:29.440
for any use whatsoever and they
say that their product is not fit

00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:31.710
for any purpose and
things like that,

00:23:31.710 --> 00:23:34.540
which maybe they might make
sense in a pure software context,

00:23:34.540 --> 00:23:39.160
although I'm skeptical, but in a
typical consumer product standpoint

00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:42.400
where you have software that
is controlling power tools

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:46.270
or a rice cooker, you know, I'm
very skeptical of things like that.

00:23:46.270 --> 00:23:48.510
But I don't think that
it is copyright law

00:23:48.510 --> 00:23:51.030
that should really be part
of the discussion in terms

00:23:51.030 --> 00:23:52.570
of those sorts of consumer
protection.

00:23:52.570 --> 00:23:56.610
&gt;&gt; Sy Damle: And is it your
view that to the extent

00:23:56.610 --> 00:23:59.040
that there are licenses that
do that that the state laws

00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:02.770
that you mentioned would
apply to those types of,

00:24:02.770 --> 00:24:04.520
to those types of licenses.

00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:07.470
&gt;&gt; John Bergmayer: I think
it is unknown basically.

00:24:07.470 --> 00:24:10.040 position:56%
I think questions like that would
have to be litigated to the question

00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:11.340
of whether a disclaimer

00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:15.510
in a software license would
have greater legal effect

00:24:15.510 --> 00:24:17.030
than a typical warranty disclaimer,

00:24:17.030 --> 00:24:19.340
which in some states might
not have any legal effect.

00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:23.900
I simply don't know, and I think
that we can either start thinking

00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:27.910
about these issues now or we can
just wait for there to be decades

00:24:27.910 --> 00:24:31.110 position:56%
of litigation in a piecemeal fashion
that might vary state by state,

00:24:31.110 --> 00:24:35.950
and I think that's the direction
we're heading towards right now.

00:24:35.950 --> 00:24:38.270
&gt;&gt; Sy Damle: And is it your sense
that Congress needs to do something

00:24:38.270 --> 00:24:40.710
to fix this, or is this something
that, like what is it, what--

00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:43.200
&gt;&gt; John Bergmayer: Well, in
our comments, our position is

00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:47.790
that if you simply reject certain
interpretations of copyright law

00:24:47.790 --> 00:24:50.650 position:56%
that I think are mistaken that have
been adopted by some circuit courts,

00:24:50.650 --> 00:24:52.410
it's not necessary; however,

00:24:52.410 --> 00:24:55.510
certainly I would welcome
Congressional clarification of any

00:24:55.510 --> 00:24:58.300
of the policy points that
we've identified if it was

00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:00.780
at all feasible, but, you know, I
think right now we're really not

00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:03.500
at the stage of proposing
specific legislation so much

00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:06.790
as identifying the fault lines.

00:25:06.790 --> 00:25:08.090
&gt;&gt; Sy Damle: Okay, thanks.

00:25:08.090 --> 00:25:09.390
And we can delve into some

00:25:09.390 --> 00:25:14.590
of the licensing issues you
mentioned in the next panel.

00:25:14.590 --> 00:25:15.890
&gt;&gt; John Bergmayer: Sure.

00:25:15.890 --> 00:25:17.190
&gt;&gt; Mr. Bockert:

00:25:17.190 --> 00:25:18.490
&gt;&gt; Sy Damle: Mr. Bockert, yeah.

00:25:18.490 --> 00:25:19.790
&gt;&gt; Shaun J. Bockert: So, I guess
to start, I'm sort of confused

00:25:19.790 --> 00:25:22.060
by this resistance to drawing
lines, because it seems like we do

00:25:22.060 --> 00:25:24.690
that all the time in the law,
and we do it in copyright law,

00:25:24.690 --> 00:25:27.950
and we do it in patent law, and
we do it in trademark law, and,

00:25:27.950 --> 00:25:30.090
you know, we're relatively
comfortable with that.

00:25:30.090 --> 00:25:32.860
And I guess maybe one thing
that's coming up, and I, you know,

00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:36.730
I don't think we dispute this, is
that maybe it's not the, you know,

00:25:36.730 --> 00:25:40.070
the embedded line that is
where we draw the distinction,

00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:41.740
and maybe it's not the
everyday products line

00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:43.160
where we draw the distinction.

00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:45.100
But I would pause at that software

00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:49.840
that serves a primarily
functional role in a product ought

00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:54.850
to be treated differently, and the,
you know, the reasoning there is,

00:25:54.850 --> 00:25:56.930
you know, when you think about
it in the context of patent,

00:25:56.930 --> 00:25:58.850
we have these things that
serve functional roles

00:25:58.850 --> 00:26:02.190
in their specific [inaudible],
like the [inaudible] repair,

00:26:02.190 --> 00:26:03.700
and all sorts of, you know,

00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:08.800 position:56%
exemptions from the rights owner's
exclusive rights, and we think that,

00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:10.540
you know, several of
those [inaudible]

00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:14.180
and exemptions should also apply
in the context of copyright.

00:26:14.180 --> 00:26:18.850
&gt;&gt; Sy Damle: So when you say a
primarily functional role, I mean,

00:26:18.850 --> 00:26:20.680
all software at some
level is functional.

00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:24.920
It's telling, it's telling, you
know, transistors to go to one

00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:27.580
or zero, and so I'm wondering,

00:26:27.580 --> 00:26:29.950
I just want to dig into
that a little more.

00:26:29.950 --> 00:26:32.200
Like do you mean a
mechanical role or--

00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:33.620
&gt;&gt; Shaun J. Bockert: Sure,
it's a good question.

00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:34.920
Yeah, it's a perfect question.

00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:38.890 position:56%
So, yes, I think, so Aaron gave the
example of windshield wipers, right?

00:26:38.890 --> 00:26:42.260
So at one time you might
have had a mechanism

00:26:42.260 --> 00:26:45.800
that decided how frequently a
windshield wiper should swish,

00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:47.100
right?

00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:49.090
I'm sure there's a technical term
for swishing, but I don't know it.

00:26:49.090 --> 00:26:51.010
And, you know, and
that would be a device

00:26:51.010 --> 00:26:53.960
that would be covered
by patent, right?

00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:58.630 position:56%
And auto part makers could come in,
and they could figure out, you know,

00:26:58.630 --> 00:26:59.940
what's going on there,
and they could figure

00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:03.620
out what their rights were in order
to replace it under patent law.

00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:07.040
But now that mechanical unit
has been replaced entirely

00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:11.230
with software, and so now we've
sort of lost this aftermarket,

00:27:11.230 --> 00:27:13.810
and ultimately it's
consumers who are struggling.

00:27:13.810 --> 00:27:16.940
And that's not to say
that, you know, we don't--

00:27:16.940 --> 00:27:19.180
I think that to sort of
respond to some of the--

00:27:19.180 --> 00:27:21.780
that's not to say that we
don't respect, you know,

00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:26.470 position:56%
copyright ownership, and you know
the strong incentives that there are

00:27:26.470 --> 00:27:28.900
in coding and creating
software, but it's to say

00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:32.210
that we also have competing, you
know, incentives and motivations

00:27:32.210 --> 00:27:34.700 position:56%
and that there are ancillary markets

00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:38.530
that we should also
consider when making the law.

00:27:38.530 --> 00:27:41.520
&gt;&gt; Sy Damle: And is it your
sense, I mean there's a lot of,

00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:44.100
there's sort of established
case law about interoperability,

00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:45.640
and I know we're going to
talk about the fair use,

00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:49.430 position:56%
we have a fair use panel coming up
third, I think, but just in general,

00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:55.810
is your sense that the current
case law about allowing things

00:27:55.810 --> 00:27:59.040
like reverse engineering
and intermediate copies

00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:02.080
for reverse engineering and
enabling interoperability,

00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:04.280
do you think that case
law is sort of sufficient

00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:08.340
to give your clients
comfort, or is there more

00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:09.750
that needs to be done there?

00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:11.050
&gt;&gt; Shaun J. Bockert: No,
I think we need more,

00:28:11.050 --> 00:28:13.230
and I don't think it's
limited to interoperability.

00:28:13.230 --> 00:28:15.890
I think it would be a
replacement as well.

00:28:15.890 --> 00:28:17.410
&gt;&gt; Sy Damle: Okay, thank you.

00:28:17.410 --> 00:28:20.350
Mr. Kupferschmid.

00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:23.460
&gt;&gt; Keith Kupferschmid: Thank you.

00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:28.020
So, I actually last week
was in San Francisco

00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:31.360
for the five twelve section round
tables, and it's interesting

00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:36.910
if you look at the record and the
description of all the problems

00:28:36.910 --> 00:28:41.110
that people are having with the
DMCA notice and takedown process,

00:28:41.110 --> 00:28:43.730
and you compare that to the record
here, it's just night and day.

00:28:43.730 --> 00:28:50.710
I mean, there is very little
if any evidence of a problem.

00:28:50.710 --> 00:28:56.640
If you look through the examples
and the written testimony,

00:28:56.640 --> 00:29:00.380
you'll see a lot of mays
and coulds and mights,

00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:03.530
but you don't really
see the pure facts.

00:29:03.530 --> 00:29:06.940
And to the extent there are
pure, you know, facts, examples,

00:29:06.940 --> 00:29:12.210
I think many of them
don't have anything to do

00:29:12.210 --> 00:29:15.790
with the copyright law itself
and have to do with other things.

00:29:15.790 --> 00:29:19.220 position:56%
And I think there are other sessions
where we'll delve into that more,

00:29:19.220 --> 00:29:22.560
although I'm happy to
do that now as well.

00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:28.340
So in terms of this line drawing

00:29:28.340 --> 00:29:32.420
for embedded software,
that's one problem.

00:29:32.420 --> 00:29:35.660
And everyday consumer products,
that's another problem.

00:29:35.660 --> 00:29:40.030
I think it's interesting that the
one person here that suggested

00:29:40.030 --> 00:29:42.340 position:56%
that no we should not have a problem

00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:44.160
with any line drawing
then draws a line

00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:47.340
that encompasses every single
piece of software out there

00:29:47.340 --> 00:29:50.040
by calling it just, you
know, that any software

00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:52.400
that serves a functional
role, which is as you point

00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:55.000
out the definition of
sort of all software.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:03.220
So this line drawing frankly is
very difficult if not impossible

00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:05.650
in this particular
situation both in terms

00:30:05.650 --> 00:30:08.630
of what embedded software
means and what it means

00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:11.410
to be an everyday consumer product,

00:30:11.410 --> 00:30:15.810
and not only is it difficult,
but tissue not helpful.

00:30:15.810 --> 00:30:18.820
We already hear complaints
from the public and users

00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:22.540
that copyright law is too complex,
and now we're hearing suggestions

00:30:22.540 --> 00:30:27.090 position:56%
that not only should we, well should
we make the copyright law more

00:30:27.090 --> 00:30:30.740
complex by creating a sort of a
subcategory of software and treat

00:30:30.740 --> 00:30:33.820
that differently than
other types of software.

00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:36.660
And then we don't treat it
differently in all types

00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:37.960
of situations, just when it's

00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:40.310
in everyday consumer
products, whatever that means.

00:30:40.310 --> 00:30:45.620
So this is just a hornets' nest of
trying to draw that dividing line,

00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:48.140
which I think is a real problem.

00:30:48.140 --> 00:30:50.710
In terms of you've been asking
this question to others,

00:30:50.710 --> 00:30:53.460
so I'm going to preempt you and
just try to answer this myself,

00:30:53.460 --> 00:30:55.240
you mentioned the rental
right limitation

00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:57.680
and whether that's
a viable distinction

00:30:57.680 --> 00:31:00.740
in this particular
instance, but you also point

00:31:00.740 --> 00:31:03.830
out that Congress considered
that issue

00:31:03.830 --> 00:31:06.880
when it codified this
rental right limitation.

00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:12.050
It knew about the issue and decided
to limit it to the rental right,

00:31:12.050 --> 00:31:14.100
not apply it across the board.

00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:18.200
So I think that's significant that
Congress did consider this issue

00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:20.870
and decided to apply it
in a particular fashion

00:31:20.870 --> 00:31:22.870
and in a particular manner.

00:31:22.870 --> 00:31:26.650 position:56%
And then just lastly with regard to
licensing issues, I'll pass on those

00:31:26.650 --> 00:31:29.400
because also in session I think
it's two we'll take those up,

00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:31.110
so there were a host of
issues that are raised

00:31:31.110 --> 00:31:35.910
in that context, but
I'll wait on that.

00:31:35.910 --> 00:31:38.540
&gt;&gt; Sy Damle: Mr. Tepp.

00:31:38.540 --> 00:31:39.840
&gt;&gt; Steve Tepp: Thanks very much.

00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:44.530
So one of the prior commenters
made the statement that with regard

00:31:44.530 --> 00:31:47.900
to certain products the software
just happens to be there,

00:31:47.900 --> 00:31:52.040
and I don't think I could
disagree any more fundamentally

00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:53.340
with that statement.

00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:55.190
Software is not just decoration.

00:31:55.190 --> 00:31:58.680
Software makes the
products more efficient.

00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:01.330
They make it more safer.

00:32:01.330 --> 00:32:07.380
This is why software has
accounted for 15 percent

00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:12.450
of all U.S. labor productivity
gains from 2004 to 2012.

00:32:12.450 --> 00:32:13.750
And I think what this points

00:32:13.750 --> 00:32:16.650
to is really the fundamental
policy question

00:32:16.650 --> 00:32:19.360
that underlies the
entire conversation today,

00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:24.190
which is on the one hand we have
a vibrant software industry.

00:32:24.190 --> 00:32:28.720
The United States unquestionably
leads the world in this field.

00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:30.500
Three point two percent

00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:36.090
of our entire GDP is
from software industry.

00:32:36.090 --> 00:32:38.680
Exports of software and related
services have grown by nine

00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:42.830
to ten percent every
year since 2006.

00:32:42.830 --> 00:32:45.800
We have something in our system,

00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:49.010
and I think it's beyond
any serious question

00:32:49.010 --> 00:32:53.110
that copyright law is an
important part of that system

00:32:53.110 --> 00:32:58.220
that has generated a
vibrant, productive industry

00:32:58.220 --> 00:33:02.920
that has helped the
entire country innovate

00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:06.330
and move forward into
the modern era.

00:33:06.330 --> 00:33:08.370
So that's the one hand.

00:33:08.370 --> 00:33:13.660
On the other hand, as several of
my co-panelists have pointed out,

00:33:13.660 --> 00:33:17.360
the concerns that are being
raised are often hypothetical.

00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:19.070
There are some anecdotes.

00:33:19.070 --> 00:33:22.270
Very little of it is
traceable actually

00:33:22.270 --> 00:33:25.460
to copyright law as the problem.

00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:31.340
So thus put I think
it's fairly clear

00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:36.940
that there's a very high threshold
for demonstrating any need for,

00:33:36.940 --> 00:33:41.490
as we'll get to later in the
day, a fairly drastic remedy

00:33:41.490 --> 00:33:45.350
of preempting contract
terms, and I don't think

00:33:45.350 --> 00:33:47.830
that threshold has been met.

00:33:47.830 --> 00:33:52.120
And I'll just, coming back to
the 117 rental issue that's come

00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:55.790
up a few times, I'll just add
to what Keith said a moment ago

00:33:55.790 --> 00:34:01.980
with which I agree, that that
amendment was actually designed

00:34:01.980 --> 00:34:05.000
to protect copyright and software,

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:09.670
the rental of software
was leading to piracy.

00:34:09.670 --> 00:34:14.450
People would rent the back then
floppy disk, take it home, copy it,

00:34:14.450 --> 00:34:17.560
and then return the
object of the rental.

00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:22.450
To the extent that at the time
that amendment was passed,

00:34:22.450 --> 00:34:27.180 position:56%
the ability to engage in that type
of piracy and other types of objects

00:34:27.180 --> 00:34:29.860
where you didn't have the
floppy disk at your disposal,

00:34:29.860 --> 00:34:34.510
I think is a significant part of
why Congress made that distinction.

00:34:34.510 --> 00:34:39.090 position:56%
It was not a distinction designed to
denigrate the protection of software

00:34:39.090 --> 00:34:43.220
in other areas but to enhance
its protection in areas

00:34:43.220 --> 00:34:46.970
where it was the most
vulnerable to piracy.

00:34:46.970 --> 00:34:51.070
It's an open question as to going
forward whether piracy is becoming

00:34:51.070 --> 00:34:55.520
easier across the board, but I
think it's important to remember

00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:57.030
that origin of that provision.

00:34:57.030 --> 00:35:01.410 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Sy Damle: Well you raised piracy,
I mean I guess one question is,

00:35:01.410 --> 00:35:06.600
are there concerns about
piracy in embedded software

00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:08.710
and in circumstances sort
of where that exception

00:35:08.710 --> 00:35:12.690 position:56%
to the consumer rental, the computer
rental amendments act applies,

00:35:12.690 --> 00:35:16.480
where you have a nest thermostat
which has software in it.

00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:19.230
Ordinarily it would be pretty
hard to copy the software off

00:35:19.230 --> 00:35:24.330
of that device, but you suggested
maybe that's not the case anymore,

00:35:24.330 --> 00:35:26.700
so I don't know if you
want to discuss that?

00:35:26.700 --> 00:35:32.740
&gt;&gt; Steve Tepp: Well, I think we
can all foresee that as it's easier

00:35:32.740 --> 00:35:38.940
and easier to have in ordinary
consumers' hands the ability

00:35:38.940 --> 00:35:45.480
to access software that is embedded
in a thermostat, as you posit.

00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:49.280
Then piracy does I think
become a greater concern.

00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:53.010
&gt;&gt; Sy Damle: But piracy, I
mean what would be the purpose

00:35:53.010 --> 00:35:54.720
of such piracy if you
don't, I mean--

00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:59.130 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Steve Tepp: Well, if the software
is the distinguishing characteristic

00:35:59.130 --> 00:36:02.940
of a product that gives it
a competitive advantage,

00:36:02.940 --> 00:36:09.740
and I wanted to compete in that
marketplace, then I would benefit

00:36:09.740 --> 00:36:16.530 position:56%
from pirating that software into a
competing product, just one example.

00:36:16.530 --> 00:36:19.110
&gt;&gt; Sy Damle: So it's
more competitors rather

00:36:19.110 --> 00:36:22.460
than sort of mass market piracy?

00:36:23.530 --> 00:36:26.660
&gt;&gt; Steve Tepp: You know, there's
so much innovation in this space,

00:36:26.660 --> 00:36:29.450
I don't pretend to have
the imagination necessary

00:36:29.450 --> 00:36:32.990 position:56%
to envision every possible scenario.

00:36:34.410 --> 00:36:36.650
The fundamental case I'm making is

00:36:36.650 --> 00:36:41.570
that the laws we have now have
generated incredibly successful

00:36:41.570 --> 00:36:45.640
industry that has Congress
has duly considered

00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:49.690
where exceptions are necessary and
appropriate and has codified those

00:36:49.690 --> 00:36:56.210
into the statute and that
there is not evidence,

00:36:56.210 --> 00:36:57.780
not anywhere near enough evidence

00:36:57.780 --> 00:37:01.750
to suggest a drastic
remedy that's proposed.

00:37:01.750 --> 00:37:04.570
You asked a question about
piracy going forward.

00:37:04.570 --> 00:37:07.980
I was pointing out that was
Congress' motivation in the past

00:37:07.980 --> 00:37:10.570
in the section 117 amendment.

00:37:10.570 --> 00:37:13.100
To the extent you're
asking me going forward,

00:37:13.100 --> 00:37:16.370
are there potentially piracy
concerns, I don't want to rule them

00:37:16.370 --> 00:37:18.530
out because I don't know.

00:37:18.530 --> 00:37:22.360
I can imagine the scenario
where there could be.

00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:23.660
&gt;&gt; Sy Damle: Okay, thank you.

00:37:23.660 --> 00:37:26.630
Mr. Mohr? And then we'll go
over to I think Mr. Bergmayer,

00:37:26.630 --> 00:37:28.010
then Mr. Band, and then
back to you, Mr. Zuck.

00:37:28.010 --> 00:37:29.600
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:30.900
Oh, sorry.

00:37:30.900 --> 00:37:32.520
And then we'll end up with you.

00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:33.820
Okay.

00:37:33.820 --> 00:37:35.120
&gt;&gt; Chris Mohr: Thank you.

00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:41.820
A few, and I'll try to brief
and not overly redundant.

00:37:41.820 --> 00:37:47.800
The first-- I do think it's from
our perspective important to look

00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:52.930
at this not from a framework of
problems but frankly a framework

00:37:52.930 --> 00:37:57.230
of overwhelming success, and that
is namely that the application

00:37:57.230 --> 00:38:01.070
of copyright to software has
been enormously successful

00:38:01.070 --> 00:38:04.050
in spurring innovation, and we've
heard numbers and statistics

00:38:04.050 --> 00:38:06.200
about that, and we
had some, you know,

00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:09.420
we put some in our filing as well.

00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:14.730
Not only has it been true
for software generally,

00:38:14.730 --> 00:38:19.770 position:56%
but you're also seeing an enormous
amount of investment in the internet

00:38:19.770 --> 00:38:23.660
of thing in terms of venture
capital, and we've cited some

00:38:23.660 --> 00:38:26.160
of that stuff in our
footnotes as well.

00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:29.430
And so I guess when we hear
about these things we say,

00:38:29.430 --> 00:38:31.020
okay, well what's the problem.

00:38:31.020 --> 00:38:34.100
And frankly for us there isn't one,

00:38:34.100 --> 00:38:35.760
and there isn't one for
a couple of reasons.

00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:42.300
The first is that the
copyright law has enabled us

00:38:42.300 --> 00:38:45.820
to have both predictable and
flexible business models.

00:38:45.820 --> 00:38:47.980
That licensing model
has worked very well.

00:38:47.980 --> 00:38:51.210
It's worked very well not only
for our member software companies,

00:38:51.210 --> 00:38:55.680
but we also see it potentially
working well in the internet

00:38:55.680 --> 00:39:01.820 position:56%
of things as software in that space
becomes more and more like a service

00:39:01.820 --> 00:39:04.850
and as consumers develop
ongoing relationships

00:39:04.850 --> 00:39:07.640
and in some cases very
specific relationships

00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:12.800
with their software providers for a
variety of different kinds of data.

00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:15.810
It will make sense to maintain
the integrity of those products

00:39:15.810 --> 00:39:20.510
that the use of them be
subject to particular terms.

00:39:20.510 --> 00:39:24.080
And there's no reason that people,
if they don't want to be subject

00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:28.030
to those terms or if they don't
want to offer material subject

00:39:28.030 --> 00:39:32.170
to those terms create a
different business model.

00:39:32.170 --> 00:39:35.940
There is nothing preventing
them from doing that.

00:39:35.940 --> 00:39:39.200
So we don't see any
useful distinction

00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:46.100
or manageable distinction that
can be drawn between software

00:39:46.100 --> 00:39:48.700
in consumer products in
any other type of software.

00:39:48.700 --> 00:39:51.520
For us, that is a false premise.

00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:54.420
The second thing, I know it's more
in the licensing area that I want

00:39:54.420 --> 00:39:59.050
to say, but I was confused
by something that one

00:39:59.050 --> 00:40:02.850
of our colleagues mentioned
before about the difference

00:40:02.850 --> 00:40:05.200
between the application
of commercial law

00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:10.320
to particular transactions
and when things go wrong,

00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:13.790
and I don't think there
is a big difference

00:40:13.790 --> 00:40:15.680
between licensing and
product liability.

00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:19.610
Product liability is a tort,
and it's a tort under state law.

00:40:19.610 --> 00:40:25.980
So if something causes a,
for example, a car to crash,

00:40:25.980 --> 00:40:27.710
the liability will sound in tort.

00:40:27.710 --> 00:40:31.410
It is not going to be governed by
the terms of a license agreement

00:40:31.410 --> 00:40:34.410
because that's, I mean that comes
out of the Bloomfield Motors case

00:40:34.410 --> 00:40:36.250
from the first year of law school.

00:40:36.250 --> 00:40:39.130
I think that's a very
different type of analysis.

00:40:39.130 --> 00:40:42.430
So trying to mix those
kinds of horribles together.

00:40:42.430 --> 00:40:47.560 position:56%
I mean, look, years ago when we were
dealing with the aftermath of ProCD

00:40:47.560 --> 00:40:50.760
and the world was going
to collapse around us,

00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:54.220
we heard very similar claims about
this, and it simply didn't happen.

00:40:54.220 --> 00:40:59.020
But this is one of the,
this was one of the areas

00:40:59.020 --> 00:41:01.240
that was mentioned back then,

00:41:01.240 --> 00:41:03.960
and I think the point is
equally applicable today,

00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:07.770
is that where there would be
product liability law that applied

00:41:07.770 --> 00:41:11.130
in the absence of privity,
there's nothing, there isn't much

00:41:11.130 --> 00:41:15.350
that a software license
can do to prevent that.

00:41:15.350 --> 00:41:16.650
&gt;&gt; Sy Damle: Okay, thank you.

00:41:16.650 --> 00:41:19.170
Mr. Bergmayer, I think
you were next.

00:41:19.170 --> 00:41:21.320
&gt;&gt; John Bergmayer: Sure, so
something that just relates

00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:23.510
to the functionality
discussion, a little bit earlier,

00:41:23.510 --> 00:41:25.720
and I'll use the windshield
wiper example that keeps coming

00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:28.590
up because I just recently replaced
the windshield wiper in my car.

00:41:28.590 --> 00:41:30.620
It was a very complicated,
mechanical contrivance.

00:41:30.620 --> 00:41:33.240
It was really difficult to get
right, and I can imagine, yeah,

00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:36.970
it's replaced with a much simpler
part, that is the micro controller

00:41:36.970 --> 00:41:40.490
with some software, you know,
connected to some motors,

00:41:40.490 --> 00:41:43.830 position:56%
and I think the question is I bought
an aftermarket windshield wiper

00:41:43.830 --> 00:41:45.900
armature replacement thing.

00:41:45.900 --> 00:41:48.540
Could I buy a replacement
micro controller

00:41:48.540 --> 00:41:50.920
with different software
written by someone else,

00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:56.270
and I think when you have software
that is of such a simple character,

00:41:56.270 --> 00:41:59.500
you end up with almost
merger doctrine issues

00:41:59.500 --> 00:42:01.850
where if someone else
re-implemented software

00:42:01.850 --> 00:42:06.150
that did the exact same thing
in terms of controlling the arms

00:42:06.150 --> 00:42:09.530
in a particular way, it very well
might be the case that looking

00:42:09.530 --> 00:42:10.950
at the original software

00:42:10.950 --> 00:42:13.090
and someone's independently
created software

00:42:13.090 --> 00:42:16.020
that does the same functions
in terms of controlling motors,

00:42:16.020 --> 00:42:18.500
you might see substantial
similarity,

00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:20.390
yet at a certain point
you have to have an idea,

00:42:20.390 --> 00:42:24.220
expression dichotomy issue because
you can't copyright the only

00:42:24.220 --> 00:42:27.050
or the most efficient
way to accomplish a task.

00:42:27.050 --> 00:42:31.450
You know, similarly if I in a
new programming language, say go,

00:42:31.450 --> 00:42:34.200
I'm the first person to come
up with the most efficient way

00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:36.220
to implement a particular
sorting algorithm.

00:42:36.220 --> 00:42:39.250
It might be very creative of me,
but that's not subject to copyright

00:42:39.250 --> 00:42:42.070
because that is an idea
expression dichotomy question.

00:42:42.070 --> 00:42:45.280
So I think there are existing
copyright law doctrines

00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:48.050
that have been around for a
really long time that at least

00:42:48.050 --> 00:42:51.240
when it comes to the very simple
software that is just sort

00:42:51.240 --> 00:42:54.980
of replacing a mechanical
part could ready apply

00:42:54.980 --> 00:42:59.070
to at least prevent the use
of copyright to, you know,

00:42:59.070 --> 00:43:03.850
to limit competition by
people making other, you know,

00:43:03.850 --> 00:43:07.600
competing products, and I think
that is, it's just something

00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:10.040
that people need to keep in mind
when considering these things.

00:43:10.040 --> 00:43:11.800
&gt;&gt; Sy Damle: Okay, thank you.

00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:13.100
Mr. Band.

00:43:13.100 --> 00:43:14.890
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Band: So some
folks on the other side

00:43:14.890 --> 00:43:18.960
of the room have said repeatedly
that there is no evidence.

00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:21.830
Now simply saying that there is
no evidence doesn't make all the

00:43:21.830 --> 00:43:24.860
evidence that's already been
submitted in the record vanish.

00:43:24.860 --> 00:43:27.030
You know, you have to actually
look what's in the record,

00:43:27.030 --> 00:43:30.820
and so we've had Mr. Lowe
submit, you know, you know,

00:43:30.820 --> 00:43:38.250
comments on behalf of thousands
of auto repair folks who deal

00:43:38.250 --> 00:43:41.860
with this problem of replacement
parts and exactly the kinds

00:43:41.860 --> 00:43:45.490
of things we're talking about
here, and the competition

00:43:45.490 --> 00:43:47.530
and the aftermarket and
the diagnostic software,

00:43:47.530 --> 00:43:51.000
all of these related issues, they
deal with that problem every day.

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:56.470
I represent, within the Owner's
Rights Initiative are two trade

00:43:56.470 --> 00:43:59.520
associations representing
computer resellers

00:43:59.520 --> 00:44:03.850
and independent repair providers,

00:44:03.850 --> 00:44:07.210
and they deal with this
issue every single day.

00:44:07.210 --> 00:44:16.620 position:56%
The Cisco frequently asked questions
specifically talks about resell

00:44:16.620 --> 00:44:20.790
and restrictions that they
place on resale of their servers

00:44:20.790 --> 00:44:24.570
because of the software and
they cite Verner v. AutoDesk.

00:44:24.570 --> 00:44:26.280
It's in their frequency
asked questions.

00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:28.460
It's not an occasionally
asked question.

00:44:28.460 --> 00:44:33.250 position:56%
It's a frequently asked question,
which indicates that people who want

00:44:33.250 --> 00:44:37.080
to buy these materials
frequently ask that question.

00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:40.570
HP has the same thing in their
frequently asked questions.

00:44:40.570 --> 00:44:43.820
So this is, and the
issue of independent,

00:44:43.820 --> 00:44:48.460
the issue of competition in the
aftermarket has been an issue,

00:44:48.460 --> 00:44:52.510
an ongoing issue, competitively
in the computer industry

00:44:52.510 --> 00:44:55.950
from the beginning and
the independent software,

00:44:55.950 --> 00:44:59.570
independent maintenance and repair.

00:44:59.570 --> 00:45:03.730
It's been a big issue from
the beginning, and, you know,

00:45:03.730 --> 00:45:08.170
117 was amended precisely
to deal with that.

00:45:08.170 --> 00:45:10.820
I mean it's a constant struggle.

00:45:10.820 --> 00:45:14.810
Now in the competitive
struggle in Congress,

00:45:14.810 --> 00:45:19.830
typically the original equipment
manufacturers have a lot more

00:45:19.830 --> 00:45:27.900
lobbying power than the independent
repair folks, but that doesn't mean

00:45:27.900 --> 00:45:31.130
that the outcome that they are
pushing for and have pushed

00:45:31.130 --> 00:45:32.850
for is necessarily

00:45:32.850 --> 00:45:35.180
from a [inaudible] perspective
of the optimal outcome.

00:45:35.180 --> 00:45:39.120
I mean the point is is that
again, this is an issue.

00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:43.890
Right now we see it very much in
the, you know, the computer area

00:45:43.890 --> 00:45:49.530 position:56%
and in the automotive area, and it's
important for you all to focusing

00:45:49.530 --> 00:45:51.400
on this now because
very soon it's going

00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:54.200
to be applying everywhere else.

00:45:54.200 --> 00:45:57.580
&gt;&gt; Sy Damle: So if I can
just defend Congress,

00:45:57.580 --> 00:45:59.870
since I have representatives from
Congress sitting in the audience.

00:45:59.870 --> 00:46:03.560
I mean they did, just to push back
on that point, they did, you know,

00:46:03.560 --> 00:46:07.520
after MAI, they did issue an
amendment to section 117 to address

00:46:07.520 --> 00:46:13.450
that specifically out of concern
for the independent repair to sort

00:46:13.450 --> 00:46:17.520
of facilitate independent repair,
to deal with that particular issue,

00:46:17.520 --> 00:46:21.700
and so I think there is evidence
that there's that kind of,

00:46:21.700 --> 00:46:24.560
that sort of problem
happening today.

00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:26.570
I think, I imagine we would be

00:46:26.570 --> 00:46:30.290
and Congress would be
willing to examine that.

00:46:30.290 --> 00:46:33.720
So that takes me to the next point,
which is, I think it's one thing

00:46:33.720 --> 00:46:35.480
to say that there are issues,
and there are obviously lots

00:46:35.480 --> 00:46:37.060 position:56%
of difficult issues in copyright law

00:46:37.060 --> 00:46:39.710
and determining whether
something is [inaudible]

00:46:39.710 --> 00:46:41.530
or not is a difficult issue,

00:46:41.530 --> 00:46:46.690
and so I'm just wondering whether
you have sort of specific examples

00:46:46.690 --> 00:46:52.760
of either, you know, threats of
litigation or litigation or sort

00:46:52.760 --> 00:46:55.480
of areas where it's like
clear that that's something

00:46:55.480 --> 00:46:58.290
that an independent repair person

00:46:58.290 --> 00:47:00.860
or someone who's making
an aftermarket part wants

00:47:00.860 --> 00:47:05.980
to do is being prevented from doing
because of current copyright law.

00:47:05.980 --> 00:47:11.310
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Band: Well, my, you
know, the folks within ORI report

00:47:11.310 --> 00:47:15.770
that they are, you know,
constantly being pushed

00:47:15.770 --> 00:47:18.510
around by the large
computer manufacturers,

00:47:18.510 --> 00:47:22.590
that more importantly their
customers are being told not

00:47:22.590 --> 00:47:29.200 position:56%
to get the services and not to buy,
you know, used and replacement parts

00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:31.070
and so forth from my people.

00:47:31.070 --> 00:47:38.660 position:56%
And that's what inspired our group
to work with Congressman [inaudible]

00:47:38.660 --> 00:47:39.960
in support of YODA [phonetic].

00:47:39.960 --> 00:47:44.100
I mean, that's, that was a very
specific bill that was responding

00:47:44.100 --> 00:47:48.200
to a specific problem
that our members say

00:47:48.200 --> 00:47:51.220
that they encounter all the time.

00:47:51.220 --> 00:47:55.020
I don't think there's been a
complaint filed that I'm aware of,

00:47:55.020 --> 00:47:57.760
but it is a constant issue.

00:47:57.760 --> 00:48:01.950
&gt;&gt; Sy Damle: And do you have, I
mean, so I looked at the licenses

00:48:01.950 --> 00:48:05.180
that you cited and sort of
looked up for example, NetApp,

00:48:05.180 --> 00:48:10.690
and NetApp is an enterprise
data storage company.

00:48:10.690 --> 00:48:12.930
Cisco, as far as I could
tell, applies those sorts

00:48:12.930 --> 00:48:16.800
of restrictive license terms on
its enterprise level devices.

00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:21.670 position:56%
And I couldn't, what I couldn't find
from your submission was an example

00:48:21.670 --> 00:48:25.200
of sort of a consumer level device,

00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:28.620
or even a small business
level device

00:48:28.620 --> 00:48:32.830
that had these sorts of,
these sorts of issues.

00:48:32.830 --> 00:48:36.380
And I assume that you
would concede in sort

00:48:36.380 --> 00:48:39.790
of business-to-business context,
there's much more sort of a balance

00:48:39.790 --> 00:48:42.910
of bargaining power,
and so I think what one

00:48:42.910 --> 00:48:45.700
of our concerns is again
to draw the distinction.

00:48:45.700 --> 00:48:48.580
I think it's appropriate and the
law does, as Mr. Bergmayer said,

00:48:48.580 --> 00:48:53.590 position:56%
draw a distinction between
enforcing contracts between sort of,

00:48:53.590 --> 00:48:57.180
between two businesses and
between a business and a consumer

00:48:57.180 --> 00:49:00.720
where it's a click through or
contract [inaudible] if you will.

00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:04.550
Right, so I think that, so I'm just
curious whether you have examples

00:49:04.550 --> 00:49:09.510
of sort of consumer level devices
that have that type of problem.

00:49:09.510 --> 00:49:11.480
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Band: Well even
when it says enterprise level,

00:49:11.480 --> 00:49:12.970
I mean there are different
kinds of enterprises.

00:49:12.970 --> 00:49:17.410
You might have an enterprise
of 20 people or 30 people,

00:49:17.410 --> 00:49:24.730
and so they might have a server
for that level of enterprise,

00:49:24.730 --> 00:49:29.300
but it's still, we're not
talking about, you know,

00:49:29.300 --> 00:49:34.490 position:56%
a 100,000-person company dealing
with another 100,000-person company.

00:49:34.490 --> 00:49:38.360
And again, we see this, you
know, this is the history

00:49:38.360 --> 00:49:42.680
of the computer industry that you
have very unequal bargaining power.

00:49:42.680 --> 00:49:49.790
And you really can't bargain with
Cisco or HP or NetApp if you're a,

00:49:49.790 --> 00:49:56.290
you know, even a, you know, a
small to medium sized business.

00:49:56.290 --> 00:50:00.710 position:56%
And some of the products that the
ORI members deal with are also like,

00:50:00.710 --> 00:50:07.860
it could be equipment like
this, like these speakers,

00:50:07.860 --> 00:50:13.210 position:56%
these microphones or telephones,
and so you might have a small office

00:50:13.210 --> 00:50:17.000
where you might have ten telephones
or five telephones, and again,

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:21.230
you have very little, very
unequal bargaining strength

00:50:21.230 --> 00:50:29.510
between the small business and
the equipment manufacturer.

00:50:29.510 --> 00:50:33.040
[ Background Noise ]

00:50:33.040 --> 00:50:34.340
&gt;&gt; Mr. Bockert.

00:50:34.340 --> 00:50:35.640
&gt;&gt; Sy Damle: Sorry.

00:50:35.640 --> 00:50:36.970
&gt;&gt; Shaun J. Bockert: So,
my client Doorman Products,

00:50:36.970 --> 00:50:40.510
is facing a very real
lawsuit for, you know,

00:50:40.510 --> 00:50:43.120
alleging copyright
infringement, and they're,

00:50:43.120 --> 00:50:44.420
you know, having to defend that.

00:50:44.420 --> 00:50:47.520
So this isn't sort of theoretical
and it's not hypothetical.

00:50:47.520 --> 00:50:51.840
It's very real, and, you know, I
can't go into all of the details

00:50:51.840 --> 00:50:54.650
of the case and sort of
foreshadowing defenses,

00:50:54.650 --> 00:50:58.230
but the idea is I think this--

00:50:58.230 --> 00:50:59.950
&gt;&gt; Sy Damle: I'm sorry,
has a complaint been filed?

00:50:59.950 --> 00:51:01.250
&gt;&gt; Shaun J. Bockert: Yes,
a complaint has been filed.

00:51:01.250 --> 00:51:02.550
&gt;&gt; Sy Damle: Okay.

00:51:02.550 --> 00:51:03.850 position:56%
I think we would be interested in
seeing, if you have the docket site,

00:51:03.850 --> 00:51:05.150
we'd be interested in seeing that.

00:51:05.150 --> 00:51:06.450
&gt;&gt; Shaun J. Bockert:
I can send that.

00:51:06.450 --> 00:51:07.750
&gt;&gt; Sy Damle: Yeah, that'd be great.

00:51:07.750 --> 00:51:09.050
&gt;&gt; Shaun J. Bockert: Sure.

00:51:09.050 --> 00:51:11.530
So, and, you know, we obviously
think we have very clear defenses

00:51:11.530 --> 00:51:15.670 position:56%
and we think that existing copyright
law allows us to do what it is

00:51:15.670 --> 00:51:19.070
that we've been doing, but we
think that this could be clearer,

00:51:19.070 --> 00:51:22.020
specifically focusing on,
you know, section 117,

00:51:22.020 --> 00:51:24.770
which everyone is talking about,
and I think when you open that up,

00:51:24.770 --> 00:51:27.100
I have the, you know, the
utmost respect for the drafters

00:51:27.100 --> 00:51:30.690
in Congress, but it's very
difficult to read section 117C

00:51:30.690 --> 00:51:34.310
to an auto mechanic and have
them understand it in a clear way

00:51:34.310 --> 00:51:37.500
and have them understand how
that applies to their business.

00:51:37.500 --> 00:51:40.300
And so when you have those
difficulties, you, you know,

00:51:40.300 --> 00:51:43.150
it does create chilling
effects and innovation.

00:51:43.150 --> 00:51:46.390
And, you know, it's not only
Doorman who experiences this.

00:51:46.390 --> 00:51:49.000
I get phone calls from
several clients who are calling

00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:51.440
and saying hey, I have
this idea, can I do this?

00:51:51.440 --> 00:51:53.860
And I have to say, well, you
know, here are the limitations

00:51:53.860 --> 00:51:56.440
and here are the things that you
have to consider under copyright.

00:51:56.440 --> 00:52:00.620
And, you know, a lot of them
walk away and don't, you know,

00:52:00.620 --> 00:52:04.420
end up creating whatever business
it is that they had in mind.

00:52:04.420 --> 00:52:06.830
And I think keeping
all of this in mind,

00:52:06.830 --> 00:52:08.970
a lot of people are
talking about, you know,

00:52:08.970 --> 00:52:10.910
the success of the
software industry.

00:52:10.910 --> 00:52:13.820
I don't think anyone would
dispute that, but I do think

00:52:13.820 --> 00:52:18.340
that there is some, you know,
assumption there that the success

00:52:18.340 --> 00:52:22.200
of the software industry is
based entirely on, you know,

00:52:22.200 --> 00:52:24.690
the strength of its
protections under copyright.

00:52:24.690 --> 00:52:28.530
When historically a lot of the
software protections were based

00:52:28.530 --> 00:52:32.070 position:56%
under patent law, and patent law
has very clear exceptions for things

00:52:32.070 --> 00:52:34.070
that you're allowed to do,
like the doctrine of repair.

00:52:34.070 --> 00:52:38.360
And I think what we're positing is
some of those exceptions should be,

00:52:38.360 --> 00:52:41.970
should more clearly apply in
the context of copyright law.

00:52:41.970 --> 00:52:43.270
&gt;&gt; Sy Damle: Okay.

00:52:43.270 --> 00:52:44.980
We're running short on time, so I'm
just going to run down this side,

00:52:44.980 --> 00:52:46.530
and then we'll wrap up this panel.

00:52:46.530 --> 00:52:48.480
Mr. Kupferschmid.

00:52:48.480 --> 00:52:52.000
&gt;&gt; Keith Kupferschmid: So, I'll be
brief, I mean just to throw it back

00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:55.130
in Jonathan's lap here I suppose
a little bit is that, you know,

00:52:55.130 --> 00:52:58.390
he said just because you say the
problems don't exist doesn't mean

00:52:58.390 --> 00:53:00.260
they don't exist.

00:53:00.260 --> 00:53:02.750
Well the opposite, just because
you say there are problems,

00:53:02.750 --> 00:53:04.930
doesn't mean there are problems.

00:53:04.930 --> 00:53:06.230
And especially--

00:53:06.230 --> 00:53:09.290
&gt;&gt; I'll remember that the next
time you guys submit that you need

00:53:09.290 --> 00:53:10.920
to change the copyright act.

00:53:10.920 --> 00:53:12.990
&gt;&gt; Keith Kupferschmid:
Okay, and I'll watch

00:53:12.990 --> 00:53:18.540
for your tent to go
up next time too.

00:53:18.540 --> 00:53:21.800
But anyway, so the problems that,

00:53:21.800 --> 00:53:23.580
or the issues that
have been raised here,

00:53:23.580 --> 00:53:26.560 position:56%
the concerns that have been raised
here, a lot of them have very little

00:53:26.560 --> 00:53:29.090
if anything to do with the
copyright with deference

00:53:29.090 --> 00:53:31.720
to Mr. Beckert is it, Bockert.

00:53:31.720 --> 00:53:35.730 position:56%
I don't recall reading the case,
and I would also love to take a look

00:53:35.730 --> 00:53:40.390
at the case, but it seems like
it has not been adjudicated yet.

00:53:40.390 --> 00:53:43.010
So the court's may
come to the, you know,

00:53:43.010 --> 00:53:45.190
obviously to the right
decision at the end of the day.

00:53:45.190 --> 00:53:48.340
It is worth mentioning that
there are at least one,

00:53:48.340 --> 00:53:52.290
probably many different voluntary
agreements having to do sort

00:53:52.290 --> 00:53:54.480
of a right of repair at
least in automotive industry,

00:53:54.480 --> 00:53:58.960 position:56%
so it is worth mentioning that there
are groups that can come together

00:53:58.960 --> 00:54:05.930 position:56%
and address these issues too
outside of Congress or other places.

00:54:05.930 --> 00:54:08.280
&gt;&gt; Sy Damle: Okay, thank you.

00:54:08.280 --> 00:54:11.390
I'm not sure, Mr. Lowe, were you--

00:54:11.390 --> 00:54:14.170
yeah, okay, Mr. Lowe,
and then Mr. Tepp.

00:54:14.170 --> 00:54:17.870
&gt;&gt; Aaron Lowe: No, I wanted
to clarify, first of all,

00:54:17.870 --> 00:54:21.190
the case is real, and we're
familiar with the case

00:54:21.190 --> 00:54:25.400 position:56%
that Mr. Bockert brought up, but
every day when companies are looking

00:54:25.400 --> 00:54:29.430
at parts now they're looking at
software-enabled parts, most,

00:54:29.430 --> 00:54:31.800
you know every day they have
to make a decision whether

00:54:31.800 --> 00:54:34.090
to reverse engineer or
whether they can, you know,

00:54:34.090 --> 00:54:36.470
innovate with the development
of that part,

00:54:36.470 --> 00:54:39.000
and every day that decision
is affected by copyright law

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:42.320
so that there are very real
effects that are going on because

00:54:42.320 --> 00:54:46.250
of this field and the need to
clarify the right to repair

00:54:46.250 --> 00:54:50.720
in this software copyright area
because, you know, whether,

00:54:50.720 --> 00:54:52.980
you know, we all say
software copyright is fine

00:54:52.980 --> 00:54:55.370
and there are no problems,
well, this is, you know,

00:54:55.370 --> 00:54:56.800
this is an area in automotive.

00:54:56.800 --> 00:55:00.400
When you purchased a car, you
own that car and you are able

00:55:00.400 --> 00:55:03.680
to modify it to do work
on that car, to repair it,

00:55:03.680 --> 00:55:10.570 position:56%
and that's been a longstanding
standard, but now with the software,

00:55:10.570 --> 00:55:13.900
you know, software now implemented
on almost every part and component

00:55:13.900 --> 00:55:17.370
on a car, that's now becoming more
difficult and more questionable,

00:55:17.370 --> 00:55:20.250
and so what we're looking for is
more clarification in that area

00:55:20.250 --> 00:55:23.840
to make sure that, you know,
when you do want to work

00:55:23.840 --> 00:55:26.360
on a part you know that
there is a certain standard

00:55:26.360 --> 00:55:29.320
that we've gotten used to in
the patent area is also applied

00:55:29.320 --> 00:55:30.790
in the copyright area.

00:55:30.790 --> 00:55:32.170
&gt;&gt; Sy Damle: Mr. Tepp.

00:55:32.170 --> 00:55:34.080
&gt;&gt; Steve Tepp: Thank you.

00:55:34.080 --> 00:55:42.410
So, oops, you know, the copyright
law already has clear jurisprudence

00:55:42.410 --> 00:55:47.480
and codification by Congress of
reverse engineering for purposes

00:55:47.480 --> 00:55:49.650
of interoperability, so,

00:55:49.650 --> 00:55:52.670
and the Chamber is certainly not
here to take issue with that.

00:55:52.670 --> 00:55:59.610
And the copyright office has
famously issued some 1201 rulings

00:55:59.610 --> 00:56:02.570
that are in furtherance
of that goal.

00:56:02.570 --> 00:56:09.400
So I think that ought not be lost
in question of replacement parts.

00:56:09.400 --> 00:56:16.570
In terms of overall evidentiary
issues, again, you know,

00:56:16.570 --> 00:56:19.880
even the cases that have been
brought up, you've, the panel,

00:56:19.880 --> 00:56:21.610
this morning has distinguished

00:56:21.610 --> 00:56:27.210 position:56%
from copyright law respectfully a
frequently asked question is perhaps

00:56:27.210 --> 00:56:31.430
not a scientific designation
of how often an issue may arise

00:56:31.430 --> 00:56:34.390
to the extent that the concern
is oh my gosh, we have to think

00:56:34.390 --> 00:56:37.030
about copyright law
when we do our business.

00:56:37.030 --> 00:56:42.080
Well, yes, people have
legal property rights

00:56:42.080 --> 00:56:45.010
that ought not be infringed
particularly

00:56:45.010 --> 00:56:51.430 position:56%
when there are means available under
the statute to engage in repair,

00:56:51.430 --> 00:56:57.130
to engage in reverse engineering,
and none of this justifies,

00:56:57.130 --> 00:56:59.300
as we'll get to later in
the discussion I suppose,

00:56:59.300 --> 00:57:03.230
this notion of wholesale
preemption of contract terms,

00:57:03.230 --> 00:57:05.780
which is an anathema to
the free market system

00:57:05.780 --> 00:57:08.540
that copyright is designed
to work within.

00:57:08.540 --> 00:57:12.700
And just coming back finally to the
piracy question we asked earlier,

00:57:12.700 --> 00:57:15.690
the one point that occurred
to me I should have made is

00:57:15.690 --> 00:57:21.170
that there is a clear and present
issue with piracy particularly

00:57:21.170 --> 00:57:26.860
in the area where the device that's
run by software is the device

00:57:26.860 --> 00:57:31.350
that helps perform and display
other forms of copyrighted works,

00:57:31.350 --> 00:57:34.210
whether they be music,
movies, what not.

00:57:34.210 --> 00:57:39.130
Absolutely in that context you
have the capacity for piracy

00:57:39.130 --> 00:57:42.740
of either the software
and/or the works

00:57:42.740 --> 00:57:47.410
that the device is
designed to perform.

00:57:47.410 --> 00:57:49.450
&gt;&gt; Sy Damle: Mr. Zuck.

00:57:49.450 --> 00:57:50.750
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Zuck: Thanks.

00:57:50.750 --> 00:57:53.840
I'm not a lawyer and so
probably the least interested

00:57:53.840 --> 00:58:00.140
in reading the complaint,
but as a software developer,

00:58:00.140 --> 00:58:03.250
what I've seen historically
is there's always been a kind

00:58:03.250 --> 00:58:06.670
of tension between intellectual
property and commoditization.

00:58:06.670 --> 00:58:09.540
And that tension has been
interesting in a lot ways

00:58:09.540 --> 00:58:12.210
that the argument is made

00:58:12.210 --> 00:58:14.230
that eventual commoditization
actually leads

00:58:14.230 --> 00:58:16.780
to innovation at some level.

00:58:16.780 --> 00:58:19.000
But now the thing you were
protecting you don't have anymore,

00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:20.500
and you now have to
re-innovate, etc.,

00:58:20.500 --> 00:58:22.720
but there's also a historical
precedent that's sort

00:58:22.720 --> 00:58:27.500 position:56%
of like commoditization too soon can
undermine investment in innovation.

00:58:27.500 --> 00:58:30.870
But I think the key thing here,
and this will come up over

00:58:30.870 --> 00:58:34.040
and over again, is that we
should never confuse the two.

00:58:34.040 --> 00:58:37.190
Commoditization is not innovation,

00:58:37.190 --> 00:58:40.300
and very often innovation
is happening here.

00:58:40.300 --> 00:58:44.400
Commoditization is happening
elsewhere, and so to look at that

00:58:44.400 --> 00:58:48.320
as commoditization is an
innate good or as specifically

00:58:48.320 --> 00:58:52.030
as innovation I think is a
frightening characteristic for it

00:58:52.030 --> 00:58:53.950
because it's that innovation
that I think that we need

00:58:53.950 --> 00:58:57.600
to make sure we're protecting and
the copyright was put in place

00:58:57.600 --> 00:59:01.480
to protect and be very
cautious of things that sort

00:59:01.480 --> 00:59:05.730
of institutionalize commoditization
too early in a product cycle.

00:59:05.730 --> 00:59:07.030
&gt;&gt; Sy Damle: Okay.

00:59:07.030 --> 00:59:08.330
Thank you.

00:59:08.330 --> 00:59:11.300
Mr. Troncoso, do want
to have the last word?

00:59:11.300 --> 00:59:12.600
&gt;&gt; Christian Troncoso: Thank you.

00:59:12.600 --> 00:59:13.980
I think one of the
important questions

00:59:13.980 --> 00:59:16.420 position:56%
that Chairman Grassley [phonetic]
and Senator Leighey [phonetic] asked

00:59:16.420 --> 00:59:20.750
in their letter that prompted this
study, is for you guys to look

00:59:20.750 --> 00:59:23.530
into what provisions of the
copyright act sort of apply

00:59:23.530 --> 00:59:27.350
and how they apply now in this era
where there's ubiquitous software

00:59:27.350 --> 00:59:29.750
in our consumer devices, and one

00:59:29.750 --> 00:59:32.120
of the things we've heard
repeatedly here on this panel is

00:59:32.120 --> 00:59:34.750
that there seems to be
some misunderstanding

00:59:34.750 --> 00:59:38.300
at least among some folks
about how existing safeguards

00:59:38.300 --> 00:59:41.880
in the copyright act might
actually be there and might be able

00:59:41.880 --> 00:59:43.540
to resolve some of
the problems and some

00:59:43.540 --> 00:59:45.720
of the tensions that
we're experiencing.

00:59:45.720 --> 00:59:49.230
So I think it would be helpful
for you guys in this study to talk

00:59:49.230 --> 00:59:52.600
about that, talk about how
I know that 1201 is sort

00:59:52.600 --> 00:59:54.570 position:56%
of a four-letter word in this panel.

00:59:54.570 --> 00:59:55.960 position:56%
We're not supposed to talk about it,

00:59:55.960 --> 01:00:02.950
but how the triennial rule making
is there to sort of provide sort

01:00:02.950 --> 01:00:06.350
of a release on the tensions
that might build on sort of right

01:00:06.350 --> 01:00:09.870
to repair like issues and
also how fair use cases

01:00:09.870 --> 01:00:12.970
like Connectix [phonetic]
and Sega v. Accolade apply

01:00:12.970 --> 01:00:17.160
to permit reverse engineering
for purposes of interoperability.

01:00:17.160 --> 01:00:20.990
&gt;&gt; Sy Damle: So do you think it's
appropriate for the public to look

01:00:20.990 --> 01:00:25.650 position:56%
at our 1201 rule makings as guidance
with respect to questions about 117,

01:00:25.650 --> 01:00:28.990
fair use, that sort of thing?

01:00:28.990 --> 01:00:30.370 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Christian Troncoso: I'm not sure,

01:00:30.370 --> 01:00:33.310
I'm not sure if I would
