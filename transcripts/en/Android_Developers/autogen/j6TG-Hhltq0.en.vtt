00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:11.090
 I think developing a game is a creative process like writing a novel 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:14.770
 I have studied literature and history as well 

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:19.050
 You can use vulgar statements to describe the date when you want to be funny 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.650
 And when it wants to distinguish between old events and contemporary events 

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:28.260
 I think the same relationship applies to software development and story writing 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.610
 You specify the item names 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:34.080
 You define the logic that connects the elements 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.345
 This is a lot like writing a sentence 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.690
 I have developed "Reigns" in my home and on my PC 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.990
 The first release was released the week my son was born 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:53.910
 I was happy at the time 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.660
 The development of the game "Reigns" took 9 months 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.630
 Such as the usual period of pregnancy 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:00.880
 The work was hard 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.060
 My life changed with the birth of my son 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.910
 I wanted to be influential in this world 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:08.434
 Working as a freelance game developer lets you do that 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:14.920
 It is very easy to work alone 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.950
 But not so games are developed 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.170
 You can not design every small part 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.350
 You must have the skill to show your business to people 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.960
 Thus gaining a new perspective and new ideas 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.480
 This is very important 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.540
 Your ability to experience new things makes you free 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.360
 So that you can work in the area you love 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.515
 You can work with people from all over the world 

00:01:46.065 --> 00:01:49.420
 And when I reflect on what I did in a short time 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.060
 I am very excited to continue the work 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.860
 The idea of ​​"Reigns" is a combination of "Tinder" and "Game of Thrones" 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.530
 Swipe with your finger to start the adventure 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.620
 We have relied so much on imagination. 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.170
 Reading a few words and a few sentences 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.240
 You should be able to imagine yourself as king. 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.910
 I think the first time I was satisfied with the game 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.080
 When I saw a user of the game he was laughing while playing 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.568
 And then I knew that we had made something innovative 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.240
 Google Play helped us succeed 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.160
 And to promote the game in the most important times 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.680
 And that the game will receive 1.5 million downloads. 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.630
 So the Google Play standalone competition was great. 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.330
 It is important to try things to advertise yourself. 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.300
 You get the most out of every opportunity you have. 

00:02:50.548 --> 00:02:53.415
 The development of mobile games is still fairly new. 

00:02:53.415 --> 00:02:55.980
 We know that the game users have become passionate about it. 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.390
 They want more stories and better ideas. 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:03.530
 We are still exploring what we can offer.
