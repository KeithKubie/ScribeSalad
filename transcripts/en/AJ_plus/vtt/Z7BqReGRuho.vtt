00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680
"Disruption and disruptive innovation"

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:02.900
"Disruptive technology"

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:04.160
"Great disruptive thinkers"

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:05.860
"Disruptions and disruptors"

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:07.620
"Disrupting, disrupting, disrupting"

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.160
"And we love the word disrupt, don't we?"

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:13.420
Disrupt! The word on your boss’s insufferable LinkedIn profile,

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:15.540
next to the picture of him and his Tesla.

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.020
Disrupt is a tech buzzword for “making things better.”

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.340
And as tech companies undermine major industries and take over public services,

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.080
we have to ask: Are they making things better?

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.300
Are they saving us from an economy and a government that don’t work for most people,

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.960
or is their success a sign that the worst is yet to come?

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.960
It might be time to disrupt ... the disrupting.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.380
Every year, tech becomes more and more part of our lives –

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:47.280
from what we buy, to where we stay on vacation,

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.500
to which stranger with too much cologne on we allow to drive us home at night.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.500
His name's Chuck and I gave him 5 stars,

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.880
'cause he let me crack the window to fumigate.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:59.880
The steady encroachment of tech reminds me of what it must have been like when we first discovered fire.

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:04.060
At first, it made life a lot easier: warming up your cave, cooking your food.

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:07.840
But then one day you wake up and your whole family is covered in it and you’re like,

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.920
“This is a little overwhelming.”

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.780
But tech is cool!

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.000
And that’s a plus when you want to distract news anchors from the potential downsides of, say,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.720
7-11 delivering you food by drone.

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.320
“The world's largest convenience store chain revealed yesterday

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.940
that is has delivered items to 77 customers in Reno, Nevada.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.960
You know what?

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.740
I can order a Slurpee from the 7-11 near my parents’ house!

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:33.920
From my parents' house!

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:35.460
- (MAN): Too much government regulation ...

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.500
- I used to walk to the 7-11!

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.220
- (JOE): You don't have to anymore.

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.080
-(MIKA): Yeah!

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:40.840
Wow.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.800
And that’s how you make the news all about yourself.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.440
Next up, we’ll mention California’s drought

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:51.780
and Mika will tell a story about beating her brother in a squirt gun fight in 1974.

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.580
And tech companies don’t just sell us on convenience and cool,

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:58.600
but also the idea that there’s nothing wrong with disrupting the market.

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:00.900
Because innovation is progress.

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.560
Like Harmony, the talking sex robot.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.900
Progress.

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.020
And innovation always leads to better results ...

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.880
right?

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:15.360
“A new report out now says Airbnb is driving up rental prices and housing availability in New York City.”

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.440
“Airbnb is playing a role in exacerbating the housing crisis

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.760
that’s already going on here in Los Angeles.”

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:28.080
"Nearly three-quarters of Airbnb's listings between 2010 and 2014 were essentially illegal hotels.”

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.640
“Ride-sharing vehicles averaging more than 170,000 trips in the city each weekday.”

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.060
“Several drivers have banded together in a class action lawsuit against the company

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.040
claiming Uber misclassified them as independent contractors

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.280
and owes them money for expenses like gas and vehicle maintenance."

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.780
“Uber claimed their background checks were sufficient.

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.960
But nearly 100 drivers were found to have failed the checks,

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:58.120
with drivers who committed fraud, assault, DUIs and even possessed fake IDs.”

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.180
OK, but what about the free gum.

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.960
Huh?

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.400
And the little waters?

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.980
But the bigger impact of tech companies isn’t just that they're disrupting retail, taxi and hotel industries,

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.800
public transportation, labor rights or the housing market.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.720
It's that they’re undermining them.

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.500
Take New York City, the one place that arguably didn’t need ride-hailing apps

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.300
with the amount of yellow cabs, car services

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:24.820
and a subway system where you can watch men dislocate their shoulders for like a buck.

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:30.100
In just the last four years, the number of for-hire vehicles operating in New York City more than doubled,

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.640
and almost two-thirds of them are now Uber cars.

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.600
As a rider trying to get uptown quickly, that sucks,

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.180
unless your favorite pastime is watching pedestrians beat you.

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.700
Ooh, look at that one go.

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:42.460
She's got a cane!

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.440
But imagine being a driver. Like Doug Schifter.

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.000
Schifter had been a limo driver since the ’80s.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.640
And in early February, he shot and killed himself outside City Hall in Manhattan

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.720
in what seemed to be an act of exasperation at the industry he built a career in.

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.980
In a Facebook post, he said he could no longer make ends meet,

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.280
even when working 100 hours a week.

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.380
On top of that, he felt let down by New York City’s politicians

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:08.600
for failing to regulate, and corporate execs for not caring.

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.600
And his sentiments are echoed by taxicab drivers too.

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:15.340
“Asafo Addai has been driving for 27 years.

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.320
And he says thanks to Uber, he now has nothing to show for it.

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:22.700
'I don’t have a life. I work 12 hours a day.

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.480
I pretty much work just to survive.' "

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.480
OK. But Uber says they give drivers flexibility:

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:33.600
Take the day off ... or ... pay rent.

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:35.320
Disrupt.

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.380
All right, let’s ask tech.

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.960
Listen to former Uber CEO Travis Kalanick justify his work:

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.080
“We look at all of the cities

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.400
and we know that the transportation systems there are just not

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.100
they’re not serving everybody’s needs.

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:51.600
Even here in New York, with a great mass transit system,

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:56.420
there’s still 2.5 million cars going over those bridges every day.

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:59.820
We just believe we can help the city do better."

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:02.760
“By building another bridge and donating to the MTA.

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:07.460
[laughs] I’m just playing, we’re adding more cars and making tons of dough!”

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:10.560
Still, Kalanick, although an unmitigated douchebag,

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.180
is unfortunately not wrong.

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:15.580
Because many mass transit systems, including the New York Subway,

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:17.060
are sorely neglected.

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:22.680
It's so bad that Pizza Rat was the best thing to happen to the New York subway in decades.

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.700
I’m surprised the MTA didn’t just make it its mascot.

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:30.460
But fixing what the government hasn’t is something Big Tech constantly claims it does.

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:33.080
Politicians have failed you, the economy has failed you.

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:36.380
And rather than change it, tech says they're here to help.

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:39.800
“I was pretty much just struggling to make ends meet."

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:40.960
"In and out of work."

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:42.200
"I couldn't pay my mortgage."

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:44.080
"I was having a lot of difficulty."

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:47.880
"When I finally came to Uber, it was probably the best thing that's happened."

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:54.300
“Airbnb can give us an extra income to help us survive a little bit better."

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:58.520
"In the past decade wages have pretty much stayed the same while costs have gone up."

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.320
"Driver with Uber, and put a dollar sign in front of your odometer. Like this guy:"

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:03.640
“Technically, I’m a cook.”

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:05.280
Yeah, technically he’s a cook

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.600
but since there’s no stability in the restaurant industry,

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:11.500
he’s gotta drive drunk 23-year-olds around and hope they don't puke in his car.

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:15.560
Now sure, renting your place on Airbnb or driving for ride-hail companies

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:17.420
might be solid temporary fixes.

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:22.180
But when they go unregulated, these precarious jobs don’t become the disruption in the market,

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:25.340
they make precarious jobs the rule of the market.

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:27.960
Which is how you get a worsening of the housing crisis

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.660
and the destruction of taxis,

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:32.980
and the reason you can't stay in your childhood bedroom when you go home for Thanksgiving

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:35.800
because it's now a "suburban oasis."

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:36.760
Really, Mom?!

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:40.920
At a time when we have more income inequality than since before the Great Depression,

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:45.640
the services these apps provide are overwhelmingly being used by people who are wealthier,

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:49.120
making you wonder if these companies are helping to close the income gap,

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:51.220
or prying it wide open.

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:53.920
Tech isn’t here to help you survive the vampire bite of capitalism –

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:56.940
it’s here to find new space on your neck.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.580
And of course, since Big Tech is so gallantly stepping in

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:02.780
to profit off of the government and our economy’s failures,

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:07.800
it only makes sense that one company is trying to tackle the biggest failure of them all.

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:11.340
“Amazon is at it again, and this could be a game changer for healthcare.

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:14.260
Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:18.860
are forming an independent healthcare company for its employees.”

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:20.000
Great idea!

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.460
'Cause there’s no reason to think that the employees you overwork and underpay

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:26.740
would be undercared for by your healthcare.

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:29.260
By the way, you're not a health care company!

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:30.540
How much you wanna bet

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:33.600
Amazon's coverage is just to cover people in bubble wrap.

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:37.080
"And you can pop some of those bubbles to distract you from the pain!"

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:38.700
Disrupt healthcare!!!!

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:40.380
[dub-step music]

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:43.740
But just because these companies want to own more and more of our lives

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:45.780
doesn’t mean they should be able to.

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:47.740
Which brings us to the “R” word,

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:49.980
the word that makes every Fox News host shudder.

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:51.180
Regulation.

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:56.680
Listen to how this conservative pundit argues against regulating the unfettered use of drones.

00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:00.800
“You’re asking the government to get involved and to be the one to regulate

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:02.400
what’s going on about technology?

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:04.580
I agree with you, I don’t want them flying on my head.

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:06.340
But I’m gonna get a helmet.

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:08.260
I have little kids, they love the drones,

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:10.980
there’s nothing you can do about it.”

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:12.780
Yeah, get a helmet!

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:15.160
That’s what being an American is all about,

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:18.980
having needless workarounds for easily regulatable tragedies,

00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:20.380
I got my drone helmet,

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:21.860
my acid rain helmet,

00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:23.100
my stray bullet helmet,

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:24.320
my rape helmet,

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:26.820
my oil spill in the drinking water helmet,

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:28.940
and my night on the town helmet.

00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:29.840
Sup.

00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:34.820
But despite the legions of lobbyists hired by tech companies to fight laws restricting them,

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:36.780
cities and states have started to regulate.

00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:40.540
Cities like London, Seattle, Baltimore, Detroit and Vancouver

00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:45.180
have been placing taxes and restrictions on short-term rental services like Airbnb.

00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:49.020
Berlin was able to bring back 8,000 housing units to the market.

00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:52.880
And ride-hailing services have been limited, taxed and subjected to more oversight

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:55.440
in states like Michigan, Massachusetts and Texas,

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:59.920
which will help raise driver wages, reduce traffic and bring more money to those states.

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:02.620
Because not all disruption is a bad thing.

00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:05.560
Uber and Lyft probably prevent a lot of driving drunk,

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:08.840
and one time I stayed in a treehouse in Nashville.

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:10.740
It was awesome.

00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:15.520
But maybe it’s time to rethink how tech isn’t fixing our real problems.

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:20.980
Instead, it’s a bandaid falling off the gaping wound left by the thing we should disrupt most of all:

00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:23.580
that vampire called capitalism.

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:27.120
Thanks again for watching Newsbroke, I'm Francesca Fiorentini, follow me on Twitter.

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:31.440
And please share this video with your network

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:33.120
to give them a more thorough picture

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:36.220
of the effects of the apps they might be using everyday.

00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:38.920
And also will you please go to our review page

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:41.660
and give us a 5-star review on Facebook Watch?

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:45.240
Because the trolls ... they come out.

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:48.160
"This is my fact helmet and you're wearing a shirt that says feminist

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:49.160
and I feel threatened.

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:50.320
One star."

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:54.520
So thank you for giving  us a review, and we'll see you next week.
