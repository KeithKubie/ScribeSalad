00:00:00.389 --> 00:00:03.190
Let's say, that there's a
country that's made up only of

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:05.393
this island that that's sitting
in the middle of the lake

00:00:05.393 --> 00:00:08.403
and on that island there
is only one dude here.

00:00:08.403 --> 00:00:10.772
He has one house and he has some land

00:00:10.772 --> 00:00:12.769
on which crops can be grown.

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:14.877
But he wants to think a
little bit more formally

00:00:14.877 --> 00:00:17.402
about his economy and he
starts setting up some

00:00:17.402 --> 00:00:20.550
institutions that start to
resemble things that we would

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.803
see in more complex economies.

00:00:22.803 --> 00:00:24.631
So what he decides to do is,

00:00:24.631 --> 00:00:26.896
he decides to set up a firm.

00:00:26.896 --> 00:00:30.003
So let me put the firm right over here.

00:00:30.003 --> 00:00:31.877
He decides to create a legal entity called

00:00:31.877 --> 00:00:34.627
some firm over here, some corporation

00:00:34.627 --> 00:00:37.070
and he's sitting here. He's the household.

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.282
He's the household of exactly one person.

00:00:39.282 --> 00:00:42.619
So this is him as a household

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:44.230
and he decides to give multiple

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.736
factors of production to the firm.

00:00:46.736 --> 00:00:49.689
So he gives factors of
production to the firm.

00:00:49.689 --> 00:00:53.137
So he gives ... He essentially
rents out his building,

00:00:53.137 --> 00:00:54.729
so he gives capital.

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:57.414
He rents out the land to the firm,

00:00:57.414 --> 00:01:00.298
so he gets ... He's giving land

00:01:00.298 --> 00:01:04.403
and he also works for the
firm, so he is giving labor

00:01:04.403 --> 00:01:07.628
and he is the owner of the firm
and he's ... He was the guy

00:01:07.628 --> 00:01:09.878
who thought of this entrepreneurial
activity, so he's also

00:01:09.878 --> 00:01:11.804
giving the factor of
production that's sometimes

00:01:11.804 --> 00:01:14.003
thrown in there as entrepreneurship.

00:01:14.003 --> 00:01:18.535
Entrepreneurship. I'll just ... I'll
just abbreviate it just like that.

00:01:18.535 --> 00:01:21.137
And in return the firm
will essentially pay rents

00:01:21.137 --> 00:01:23.577
for these factors of production.

00:01:23.577 --> 00:01:27.212
So the firm will pay him ...
will pay him money in exchange

00:01:27.212 --> 00:01:30.003
for being allowed to
use all of these things.

00:01:30.003 --> 00:01:34.420
So for the rent on the capital,
on the building itself,

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.470
so for the building ... the
building and we'll talk about

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.470
let's say this is all in a given year.

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.470
For the building, the
firm is going to pay him,

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.070
the firm that he owns is going
to pay him $1000 per year.

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.021
$1,000, so this is the building rent.

00:01:50.021 --> 00:01:51.063
Let me make it clear that this is

00:01:51.063 --> 00:01:54.229
building rent or building lease.

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:58.736
Building rent is going to pay him $1,000.

00:01:58.736 --> 00:02:03.804
For the land ... For the land
rent, he's also going to get paid

00:02:03.804 --> 00:02:08.542
another $1,000 and then for his wages,

00:02:08.542 --> 00:02:11.069
essentially the rent on his labor,

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.544
so his wages, you could view
that as a rent on labor.

00:02:13.544 --> 00:02:16.337
They're renting his ...
his energy and his time.

00:02:16.337 --> 00:02:19.766
His wages, he's also going
to get $1,000 per year.

00:02:19.766 --> 00:02:20.877
Did I say a $1,000 per month?

00:02:20.877 --> 00:02:22.877
It should be $1,000 per year.

00:02:22.877 --> 00:02:24.543
So he's getting $1,000 a
month in building rent,

00:02:24.543 --> 00:02:29.211
$1,000 a month in land and
$1,000 a month in wages

00:02:29.211 --> 00:02:32.711
and he gets whatever profit
... whatever profit comes

00:02:32.711 --> 00:02:36.851
from the firm because he is the
owner of the ... of the firm

00:02:36.851 --> 00:02:38.430
and you could say that
that's the compensation

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.878
in exchange for his entrepreneurship.

00:02:40.878 --> 00:02:43.269
So in this ... in the ...
Looking at only this part

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:47.005
or these two lines, the
household ... He is providing

00:02:47.005 --> 00:02:48.960
all of the factors of
production for the firm,

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.670
so the firm can produce useful things.

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.071
So the firm can produce goods and services

00:02:54.071 --> 00:02:56.461
and it's good that the firm
will produce goods and services

00:02:56.461 --> 00:02:58.543
because this household needs to survive.

00:02:58.543 --> 00:03:02.210
He needs a place to stay
and he needs food to eat.

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:06.337
And so let's say, with the labor
and this land and you know,

00:03:06.337 --> 00:03:08.670
so this guy is working at
this firm and it has this land

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.294
and all of the rest, it's
able to produce some food.

00:03:12.294 --> 00:03:17.197
And so it sells ... It sells
him goods and services.

00:03:17.197 --> 00:03:21.005
So it sells ... It sells his
household goods and services and

00:03:21.005 --> 00:03:25.404
in particular, it sells him
food and it also rents out

00:03:25.404 --> 00:03:27.654
the property and I think you
could see this is already getting

00:03:27.654 --> 00:03:29.121
kind of circular here.

00:03:29.121 --> 00:03:31.613
He's essentailly renting
out his own property,

00:03:31.613 --> 00:03:33.671
but this is a nice simple example.

00:03:33.671 --> 00:03:36.302
Obviously, once you expand
beyond one ... more than one

00:03:36.302 --> 00:03:39.294
person or more than one firm,
things get complicated fast.

00:03:39.294 --> 00:03:42.628
So he's getting food and shelter

00:03:42.628 --> 00:03:44.670
and in exchange for the
food and the shelter,

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.544
he's going to pay the firm.

00:03:46.544 --> 00:03:49.377
In exchange for that he's
going to pay the firm

00:03:49.377 --> 00:03:50.920
and so he's going to pay the firm.

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.961
Let's just say that he decides
there isn't much of a market

00:03:53.961 --> 00:03:55.812
right over here. He is the market.

00:03:55.812 --> 00:04:00.804
But let's say for the food ...
for the food he decides to pay,

00:04:00.804 --> 00:04:05.293
he pays $2,300. $2,300 a year for the food

00:04:05.293 --> 00:04:09.710
and for the use of the building
that is ... that the firm

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:13.878
is renting, he is paying ...
let's say he's paying $1,200.

00:04:13.878 --> 00:04:16.469
Rent of $1,200.

00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:18.736
So a couple of ways to think about it.

00:04:18.736 --> 00:04:20.627
You can look at it from the
household's point of view.

00:04:20.627 --> 00:04:22.878
What are his total expenditures?

00:04:22.878 --> 00:04:26.950
Well, total expenditures
come out to what? $3,500.

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:29.128
So this is total ... Let me
do this in a different color.

00:04:29.128 --> 00:04:34.403
This is total ... total
expenditures for this household

00:04:34.403 --> 00:04:36.404
and what's his total income?

00:04:36.404 --> 00:04:38.471
Well, he gets $1,000 for the building,

00:04:38.471 --> 00:04:41.210
$1,000 for land, $1,000
for wages and he gets

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:43.337
some profit from that firm.

00:04:43.337 --> 00:04:44.534
So we don't know what that profit is,

00:04:44.534 --> 00:04:48.070
so why don't we hold off a
little bit on his total income.

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:49.136
So I'll just write it here.

00:04:49.136 --> 00:04:51.774
Total ... total income.

00:04:51.774 --> 00:04:53.628
We don't quite know what that is yet

00:04:53.628 --> 00:04:55.210
because we have to figure
out how much profit

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:56.710
he's getting from the firm.

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:58.627
So let's look at the firm's point of view.

00:04:58.627 --> 00:05:00.877
What is the total revenue
that they're getting?

00:05:00.877 --> 00:05:06.156
For the firm, the total
revenue ... total revenue.

00:05:06.156 --> 00:05:09.070
Well, he's getting 20 ...
The firm is getting $2,300

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:11.019
for the food, $1,200 for the rent,

00:05:11.019 --> 00:05:14.868
getting total revenue of $3,500 per year.

00:05:14.868 --> 00:05:16.245
Everything here is on an annual basis.

00:05:16.245 --> 00:05:18.470
I have a feeling I said per
month by accident a few times.

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:20.137
Everything here is on an annual basis.

00:05:20.137 --> 00:05:22.339
Getting $3,500 per year

00:05:22.339 --> 00:05:24.544
and what are the firm's expenditures?

00:05:24.544 --> 00:05:28.071
Well, the firm has to has
... So this is expenses

00:05:28.071 --> 00:05:28.856
and here we're going to be thinking

00:05:28.856 --> 00:05:30.579
in terms of economic profit

00:05:30.579 --> 00:05:31.627
because we're really just thinking about

00:05:31.627 --> 00:05:33.936
how much money is coming out of this firm,

00:05:33.936 --> 00:05:35.077
out of this business.

00:05:35.077 --> 00:05:38.952
So, expenses ... So, for the
building ... the building,

00:05:38.952 --> 00:05:41.877
the firm has to pay $1,000.

00:05:41.877 --> 00:05:46.100
For the land, the firm has to pay $1,000

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:50.004
and for the labor ... and
for the labor, the firm also

00:05:50.004 --> 00:05:54.545
has to pay $1,000 and so
what's left over is the profit.

00:05:54.804 --> 00:05:57.337
We're assuming that
there's no taxes over here.

00:05:57.337 --> 00:05:58.961
This is the profit for the owners,

00:05:58.961 --> 00:06:04.469
$3,500 minus 3,000 gives
us a profit of $500

00:06:04.469 --> 00:06:06.877
and that's going to go
to the owner of the firm,

00:06:06.877 --> 00:06:09.210
who happens to be this
guy right over here.

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:15.460
So the profit is $500 and so
his total income is $3,500,

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:17.960
$3,500 and it's good that his income

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:20.877
is at least $3,500 because
that's how much he's

00:06:20.877 --> 00:06:23.670
spending it per month, spending per month.

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:26.403
Now the whole reason why I did
this is to kind of show you

00:06:26.403 --> 00:06:28.737
the circular flow of goods and services.

00:06:28.737 --> 00:06:31.135
These are the goods and services up here.

00:06:31.135 --> 00:06:33.992
Let me show ... These are
the goods and services.

00:06:33.992 --> 00:06:37.470
Goods and services.

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:40.070
The firms provide the
households goods and services

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:42.070
and then the households
are providing the firms,

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:43.628
the factors of production.

00:06:43.628 --> 00:06:44.522
And sometimes you might say,

00:06:44.522 --> 00:06:46.190
"Well, aren't other firms also providing"

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:47.457
"the factors of production?"

00:06:47.457 --> 00:06:49.402
Yes, other firms could if
there were other firms but

00:06:49.402 --> 00:06:52.402
those firms at the end of
the day are owned by someone.

00:06:52.402 --> 00:06:53.935
They are getting their
factors of production

00:06:53.935 --> 00:06:57.136
by some household or they
are owned by some household.

00:06:57.136 --> 00:06:59.547
So you can view it as
at the end of the day,

00:06:59.547 --> 00:07:01.803
the households are really giving the firms

00:07:01.803 --> 00:07:03.710
the factors of production.

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:08.804
Factors ... Factors of production.

00:07:08.804 --> 00:07:10.906
At an exchange for the
factors of production,

00:07:10.906 --> 00:07:13.604
the households in exchange
for giving these things,

00:07:13.604 --> 00:07:15.961
the firms give the households income,

00:07:15.961 --> 00:07:18.804
essentially rents on the
different factors of production

00:07:18.804 --> 00:07:21.403
that are being given to
the firm for the most part

00:07:21.403 --> 00:07:24.717
and over here in exchange
for the goods and services,

00:07:24.717 --> 00:07:27.069
the households are making expenditures

00:07:27.069 --> 00:07:30.961
that can also be considered
revenue of the firm.

00:07:30.961 --> 00:07:33.293
Now, if you were an economist
that were to observe this

00:07:33.293 --> 00:07:35.751
and I guess if we're to
focus on this island maybe

00:07:35.751 --> 00:07:37.628
he would also have to
be the island economist

00:07:37.628 --> 00:07:39.792
and you would say, "How
would you measure ... "

00:07:39.792 --> 00:07:43.137
"How would you measure the
total ... the total value of the

00:07:43.137 --> 00:07:46.004
"product ... production
of my country here?",

00:07:46.004 --> 00:07:48.543
maybe we could call it the
Gross Domestic Product.

00:07:48.543 --> 00:07:50.002
How would we measure it?

00:07:50.002 --> 00:07:52.737
Would you count just the
total expenditures or

00:07:52.737 --> 00:07:56.070
would you count the total
expenditures and the total income

00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:58.627
or would you even count
that and the revenue?

00:07:58.627 --> 00:07:59.793
Well if you counted all of that,

00:07:59.793 --> 00:08:00.960
you would be essentially triple counting.

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:02.961
If you counted the total
revenue, the total expenditures

00:08:02.961 --> 00:08:05.670
and the total income,
they are all about $3,500.

00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:07.136
You would be triple counting.

00:08:07.136 --> 00:08:08.766
So what you could do,
you could just measure

00:08:08.766 --> 00:08:10.137
only one of these things.

00:08:10.137 --> 00:08:13.897
You could say your GDP,
your Gross Domestic Product,

00:08:13.897 --> 00:08:17.329
your Gross Domestic Product
is the total expenditures

00:08:17.329 --> 00:08:21.263
by the households. So
it would be the $3,500.

00:08:21.263 --> 00:08:25.125
You could say it is the total
income by the households,

00:08:25.125 --> 00:08:28.628
so that would also be
$3,500 and the total revenue

00:08:28.628 --> 00:08:30.878
really is the same thing
as the total expenditures.

00:08:30.878 --> 00:08:32.869
So the whole point of this
video and this is, obviously,

00:08:32.869 --> 00:08:35.069
a very artificial case where
we're dealing with an island

00:08:35.069 --> 00:08:38.070
with only one person and he's
essentially renting out his

00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:41.292
own labor by using this firm
as some type of vehicle.

00:08:41.292 --> 00:08:43.270
He's consuming his own labor.

00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:45.877
He's renting out a house from a firm

00:08:45.877 --> 00:08:47.961
that he has rented his house to.

00:08:47.961 --> 00:08:50.544
So it is very, very, very
circular but hopefully this

00:08:50.544 --> 00:08:52.211
appreciate ... you kind of appreciate

00:08:52.211 --> 00:08:54.803
how the resources are going around

00:08:54.803 --> 00:08:57.500
in this kind of a circular flow.
