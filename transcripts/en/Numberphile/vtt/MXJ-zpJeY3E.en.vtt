00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.700
So what did you eat for breakfast-

00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:02.320
jam sandwich, yeah

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:05.180
You had a sandwich?
Yeah 
A jam sandwich?
Yeah

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:21.740
yeah I always loved mathematics as a kid, so

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.590
one of my earliest memories is when I was like

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.860
two years old and my grandma was

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:29.600
cleaning the windows in our home,

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.119
and I was insisting that she put

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:34.790
numbers on the- she put the detergent on

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.780
windows in the form of numbers so I always

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.240
liked numbers and patterns and logic

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:41.540
and so forth, things are very

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:42.860
black-and-white where there's one right

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:44.780
answer and everything else is wrong. I didn't

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.730
like so subjective shades of grey type

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.190
questions, I would work on math workbooks

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:50.930
for fun you know my parents wanted to

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:52.460
shut me up she just give me a workbook

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.520
and I'll just go do sums and so forth so I

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.170
always liked mathematics, math

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:58.940
competitions- doing that was very

00:00:58.940 --> 00:00:59.660
different from doing research

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.370
mathematics, the type of problems that

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.860
that you've given in a problem book and so forth

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:05.540
these are very canned problems,

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:06.740
things you can do in five minutes or ten minutes

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.590
and they don't prepare you completely

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.660
for a research problem where, you know,

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:13.100
you have to spend six months, you have to

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:14.509
read the literature, talk to people, try

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:16.130
something, doesn't work, modify, try it

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.740
again, and it's a very different

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.899
experience doing research but I like it a lot

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:23.390
better actually than– than

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:24.590
all the puzzles I used to do as a kid I

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:25.940
don't do these things very much any more.

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.320
My mother was a high school math

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.360
teacher when she was younger so she did

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.160
help me a little bit you know you know

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:35.479
when I was a kid you know,

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:37.850
just talking numbers with me and then I had a lot of

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:39.080
very good mentors when I was like 10 or

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.260
11 there was a retired maths professor

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.640
in Adelaide which I'd go visit on the

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.009
weekends, we'd have tea and cookies and you know

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:47.119
he would just discuss some some

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:49.819
recreational maths problem, and so forth, which was a

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:51.380
lot of fun. He would tell me stories

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.300
about how he'd use maths during World War Two, and so forth, you know,

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:57.620
to do ballistics and so forth. It was kind

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:00.260
of fun to actually see maths actually being used for something

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.720
"He had a PhD in maths from Princeton at

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.090
20 and was appointed professor of

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.489
mathematics at UCLA at 24"

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:12.407
I enjoyed it I mean

00:02:12.407 --> 00:02:13.430
when I was a kid I mostly enjoyed

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.560
doing math and geeky things and so forth, and

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.180
you know, being accelerated and

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.300
going to going to uni that early, I was

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:21.680
around people who are older than me

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.470
but had similar backgrounds so we were

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.000
at sort of the same level mathematically so

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.650
you know these people five years older

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.140
maybe but we're both stuck on the same homework assignments,

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.120
we both like to talk about various math concepts and so

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.460
forth so I felt at home you know so I

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:36.710
did miss out on maybe sort of the

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:38.210
regular high school experience you know

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:40.370
sort of– I didn't go to many, you know,

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:41.870
high school social events and so forth I did a

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.520
lot of that actually once I was in grad

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.470
school in Princeton. So then I

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.360
hung around people my own age and you

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.190
know, then I partied and so forth,

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.380
so I sort of had a slightly reorganized

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.800
childhood but it worked out well for me

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.610
"And I have to say Terence Tao was

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.850
competing there and he only got one out

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:03.830
of seven. Let's actually cut

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:07.220
Terrence Tao some slack, the fields medalist, the guy

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.410
who's like coming close to solving the

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.150
twin prime conjecture. It's actually

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:12.820
pretty awesome because he was only 13 years old.

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:13.960
He holds the record as the

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.040
youngest person to ever have won a gold medal."

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.700
- It was this question six.
- Oh yeah yeah yeah

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:21.590
it's a famous question yes.

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.360
What's your recollection of it now and why

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.580
you didn't get it right?
- No I did not get it right

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:29.060
- How do you feel about that? 
- I well you know you win some

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.680
you lose some. I -- oh boy -- I have --

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.390
it was so long ago now I don't remember much

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:37.880
about it. I do remember once the Olympiad

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.709
was over I found out that some

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:41.209
Romanian woman had solved

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:43.160
the question and I remember searching

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.380
out for her, because it was really bugging me that

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:48.050
that I did not know how to solve the

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:49.370
question. There's a special trick to

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:50.840
solve it, which at the time was not a

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.600
standard trick that was taught to you. You have to use a

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.540
method of descent -- you had to... I forget the

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:57.800
exact question. You had to show that

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.380
something could not be a perfect square --

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:01.640
was always a perfect square, and show

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:02.959
that if it wasn't you could find a

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:04.820
smaller counter-example and a smaller one

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:07.190
and a smaller one. I think nowadays it's

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:09.590
become part of standard training in

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:11.060
its -- they all know the trick

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:12.300
now, but...

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.780
- Were you competitive? Were you the sort of boy

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.190
that would get upset about it or was it

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:18.600
just a fascination? "I just want to know

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.100
that, I want to know the answer" or

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:21.930
when you like angry you didn't get it?

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:22.950
- I think I was more obsessive than

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:24.720
competitive, yeah, I mean certainly I was

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.220
a bit angry at myself for not getting it

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.470
but I wanted more to know the answer

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.080
than to win, I think. 
- There's this

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.990
famous image of you with Erdős.
- Yes.

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.150
- It was a great photograph. People want

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:37.410
to know what you're discussing in that

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.270
picture what's going on there. 
- Yes, I

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:40.950
think he was giving me a maths problem

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:44.250
which I did -- I think I even know which -- what it is

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:45.480
because he did send me a postcard

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.850
afterwards with what may be the same

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:49.920
problem. I have it somewhere. Yeah I think

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.840
it was it was some maths conference in

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:53.370
Adelaide, yeah I was like 10 or something

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.140
I don't know why I was there maybe

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:57.810
some math professor at

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:59.430
the University of Adelaide told me to come.

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:00.980
I understand, he was always very good at

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:07.400
at speaking to mathematically gifted kids and I don't remember much

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:09.440
about our conversation except that

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:11.130
I remember I really felt

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:12.030
like I was being treated like an equal

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:14.370
like it wasn't condescending or anything

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:16.080
like you know. It was a very

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.550
pleasant conversation you know I mean

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:18.930
now Erdős has passed you know I

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:22.650
mean it does have some sentimental value

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:25.650
for me I mean it's... Yeah, I mean I

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:27.690
certainly wish I'd paid more attention

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:29.760
to him, actually you know I mean like I'd

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:31.830
heard of him you know as a child for

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:33.330
but you know Erdős is someone...

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:37.140
...to me he was just someone who would

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:39.360
like talking math to me, and that was great. He did

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:40.830
write me a letter of recommendation for

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:43.680
Princeton later on so he did help my

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.930
career directly. 
- Did you ever have people

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:47.190
you looked up to and thought they were...

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:50.490
they were the top guns?
Not really I mean, you

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:52.169
know, I would learn about Euler and

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:53.820
Gauss, and Newton, but these are

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:56.190
largely just names. I think I didn't

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:58.290
really have a sense of... you know so I'd learn

00:05:58.290 --> 00:05:59.730
all these theorems and tricks and so forth

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:01.890
but I didn't really ever have a

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:03.300
good sense of what was the most

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:06.930
important, or what was the... yeah I

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:08.430
didn't learn the why of mathematics until

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:11.070
a lot later. I remember when I was

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:12.810
learning calculus, I thought that the

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:13.950
most important mathematician in the world must be

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:15.990
be Taylor, because Taylor's name appears

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:17.600
everywhere in

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.190
undergraduate calculus. Taylor

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:20.600
expansion, Taylor's rule and so forth and,

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:22.550
you know he was a good mathematician, but

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:24.200
you know, there were many other

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.420
people who did good stuff which is not

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:29.270
taught as much at an undergraduate level.

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:37.070
When you're doing mathematics do you use

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:38.870
any kind of visualization in your head?

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:40.250
What does it look like in your head when

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:42.100
you're doing math?

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.660
It's a bit hard to explain. It's always always a combination of

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:52.910
thinking inside your head and speaking

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:55.400
out loud and working on the board. You do

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:57.050
try to isolate sort of the simplest

00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:58.910
metaphor or something for for your

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:02.240
problem... How can I explain it... So you know,

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:04.370
for instance, I do a lot of estimates

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:07.190
I always want X less than Y and

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:09.350
sometimes it helps to think of a sort of

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:10.400
an economics problem, like "you have a

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:14.540
budget of Y, and can you afford X?" and

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:16.940
that way you start thinking economically

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:19.160
like so the way you work with

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:20.720
inequalities like X less than Y is that

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:22.730
normally you maybe try to first bound

00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:25.010
x by z and z by w and then w by y and

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:27.170
so forth and this is like you know

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:29.030
trading in you know one item for another

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:31.130
item and you get a sense of sort of what

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:32.690
inequalities are sort of good

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:34.340
deals for you that you're getting you're

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:35.660
getting you bang for your buck and which

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:37.130
ones are really wasting your money. Sometimes

00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:38.700
utilizing sort of your financial

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:40.300
intuition can be helpful.

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:45.960
Algebra and topology... Those

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:47.610
have always been my my weakest areas.

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:48.960
I've only been able to get a handle

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:51.240
on these areas generally by translating

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:53.039
them into other types of mathematics,

00:07:53.039 --> 00:07:56.490
geometry or analysis, I have better

00:07:56.490 --> 00:07:59.240
handle on... I certainly don't claim

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:00.780
any mastery of all of mathematics. I think nobody can do that

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:02.740
not since Hilbert. (David Hilbert)

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:04.800
The work I'm proudest of is almost all

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:06.479
joint work and I think

00:08:06.479 --> 00:08:08.249
nowadays most of my work is

00:08:08.249 --> 00:08:11.099
joint. It is really fun to talk over a

00:08:11.099 --> 00:08:13.020
math problem at a really high level with

00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:15.180
a co-author who who is really on your

00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:16.080
wavelength, understands what you're

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:17.969
thinking. It's actually... saying

00:08:17.969 --> 00:08:21.000
things out loud, it almost forces

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.379
you to think, like, at a more organized level

00:08:25.379 --> 00:08:27.659
than in your head where it can be

00:08:27.659 --> 00:08:30.029
a bit jumbled and vague, and it's just

00:08:30.029 --> 00:08:31.229
more fun, you know you can go back and

00:08:31.229 --> 00:08:32.909
forth and if you're stuck maybe your

00:08:32.909 --> 00:08:34.740
co-author has a suggestion if he or she is

00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:36.810
stuck you can make suggestions. You at

00:08:36.810 --> 00:08:37.860
least guarantee one other person is

00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:39.089
interested in what you're doing. You know

00:08:39.089 --> 00:08:39.899
when you write something, when you write

00:08:39.899 --> 00:08:40.890
a paper by yourself you know there's

00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:42.599
always somehow the nagging fear at the

00:08:42.599 --> 00:08:43.890
back of your mind that maybe you know no

00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:45.600
one will care about this... but you know

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:47.160
you at least have one person to talk about it

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:48.959
with. 
What do you think or feel, what's

00:08:48.959 --> 00:08:50.550
your impression of those mathematicians

00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:52.350
that go the opposite way, Andrew Wiles

00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:54.300
is an obvious example, the mathematician who

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:56.760
works in solitude. What do you...

00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:59.040
how does that impress you?
What he did

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:00.660
was very impressive... you need both.

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:05.220
You need people who focus very very hard

00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:07.560
on one very narrow problem working for

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:10.470
years, become a very deep expert. But then

00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:11.670
you need the people who can connect

00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:15.269
things in fragmented fields. I make

00:09:15.269 --> 00:09:17.130
my living you know by understanding one

00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:18.750
field X and taking some ideas from that

00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:21.240
and applying it to field Y, but I couldn't

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:22.350
do that if there weren't people who are

00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:24.839
very deeply working in in field X, and

00:09:24.839 --> 00:09:26.880
so forth, so I think it's great that

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:29.040
there's a huge diversity in

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:31.230
mathematics you know if we all thought

00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:32.760
the same way we all had similar

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:34.000
philosophy it would be a much poorer

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.520
environment.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.960
You know you can't really call

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:41.910
your shots in mathematics. Some problems,

00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:43.860
the tools are not

00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:45.330
there. It doesn't matter how

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:48.030
smart or quick you are. The analogy I

00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:49.500
have is like climbing, if you

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:51.450
want to climb a cliff that's 10 meters

00:09:51.450 --> 00:09:52.590
high you can what we do it with the

00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:53.850
right tools and equipment, but you know

00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:55.620
if it's a sheer cliff face, you know,

00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:57.240
a mile high and there's no handholds

00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:00.030
whatsoever, you know just forget it. It

00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:01.140
doesn't matter how strong you are or

00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:02.640
whatever, you have to wait until there's

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:03.990
some sort of breakthrough, like some

00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:05.520
opening occurs like halfway through,

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:07.050
halfway up the cliff and now you have

00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:08.940
some easier sub-goal. You know

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:11.700
there's some speculation, there's some

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:13.200
possible ways to attack the conjecture

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:14.970
but nothing is really promising

00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:16.890
currently. 
You're not climbing that

00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:19.260
cliff, but if few foot holes appear you

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:20.640
might run and try and climb it as well?

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:23.850
Yeah, yeah yeah! You know it would... this is

00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:25.500
the way it works, whenever there's an

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:27.000
exciting breakthrough like everyone

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.670
just sort of nearby in the area just sort of

00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:31.800
takes a look at their favorite list of

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:33.480
open problems, "okay maybe this new trick

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:36.090
can give you some advance". It's very hard

00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:37.800
to rule out that there's some major

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:39.090
breakthrough in something which seemed

00:10:39.090 --> 00:10:41.190
impossible suddenly becomes very very

00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:42.320
feasible. This has happened many times.

00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:48.180
...that is not the same thing as the full

00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:50.730
Kakeya problem because maybe as the

00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:55.050
direction varies smoothly, maybe the pole

00:10:55.050 --> 00:10:58.070
would have to jump around.
