00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:01.510
- [Instructor] You might
recognize what we have

00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:05.978
here in yellow as the
general form of a p-Series,

00:00:05.978 --> 00:00:07.622
and what we're going
to do in this video is

00:00:07.622 --> 00:00:09.551
think about under which conditions,

00:00:09.551 --> 00:00:13.455
for what 'P's will this p-Series converge.

00:00:13.455 --> 00:00:15.701
And for it to be a p-Series, by definition

00:00:15.701 --> 00:00:18.534
P is going to be grater than zero.

00:00:19.474 --> 00:00:21.348
So I've set up some
visualizations to think

00:00:21.348 --> 00:00:23.950
about how we are going to understand when

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:26.057
this p-Series converges.

00:00:26.057 --> 00:00:28.708
So over here you have the graph,

00:00:28.708 --> 00:00:31.468
this curve right here,
that's Y is equal to

00:00:31.468 --> 00:00:34.654
one over X to the P.

00:00:34.654 --> 00:00:36.092
And we're saying it in general terms,

00:00:36.092 --> 00:00:38.078
because P is greater
than zero, we know it's

00:00:38.078 --> 00:00:40.904
going to be a decreasing
function like this.

00:00:40.904 --> 00:00:43.274
Once again that's Y is equal to one over

00:00:43.274 --> 00:00:45.104
X to the P.

00:00:45.104 --> 00:00:47.271
And now what we've
shaded in ahead of time,

00:00:47.271 --> 00:00:48.989
underneath that curve, above the positive

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.975
X axis, that's is the integral.

00:00:51.975 --> 00:00:54.538
From one to infinity,

00:00:54.538 --> 00:00:57.313
the improper integral
of one over X to the P,

00:00:57.313 --> 00:01:00.123
dX, so that's this area, that I've

00:01:00.123 --> 00:01:01.979
already shaded in, you see it in white

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:03.975
in both of these graphs.

00:01:03.975 --> 00:01:05.422
And what we're going to hopefully

00:01:05.422 --> 00:01:08.150
see visually, is that there's a very close

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.424
convergence or divergence
relationship between

00:01:10.424 --> 00:01:13.540
this p-Series, and this
integral, right over here.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.170
Because when we look at
this left hand graph,

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.809
we see that this p-Series can be viewed

00:01:19.809 --> 00:01:23.729
as an upper Riemann
approximation of that area.

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.239
What do I mean by that?

00:01:25.239 --> 00:01:27.132
Well think about

00:01:27.132 --> 00:01:30.549
the area of this first rectangle.

00:01:31.614 --> 00:01:34.614
The width is one, and its' height is

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:40.002
one over one over one to the P.

00:01:40.002 --> 00:01:41.885
So this would be the first term,

00:01:41.885 --> 00:01:43.217
in this p-Series,

00:01:43.217 --> 00:01:45.553
this would just be an area of one.

00:01:45.553 --> 00:01:48.532
It's just the X and Y
scales are not the same.

00:01:48.532 --> 00:01:49.717
This one right over here;

00:01:49.717 --> 00:01:52.365
its' area would be one over two to the P.

00:01:52.365 --> 00:01:54.736
The area's one over three to the P.

00:01:54.736 --> 00:01:58.001
So the sum of the areas
of these rectangles,

00:01:58.001 --> 00:02:00.376
that is what this p-Series is, and

00:02:00.376 --> 00:02:02.565
you can see that each of these rectangles

00:02:02.565 --> 00:02:06.403
they are covering more than
the area under the curve.

00:02:06.403 --> 00:02:08.122
And so we know the area under the curve,

00:02:08.122 --> 00:02:09.701
that's gonna be greater than zero,

00:02:09.701 --> 00:02:13.505
this p-Series is going
to be greater than this

00:02:13.505 --> 00:02:16.079
integral, greater than
the area under the curve.

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:18.515
But if we add one to the
area under the curve,

00:02:18.515 --> 00:02:20.883
now we're not just talking
about the white area,

00:02:20.883 --> 00:02:23.671
we're also talking about
this red area here,

00:02:23.671 --> 00:02:25.626
then our p-Series is going
to be less than that.

00:02:25.626 --> 00:02:29.118
Because the first term of
our p-Series is equal to one,

00:02:29.118 --> 00:02:31.168
and then all of the other terms,

00:02:31.168 --> 00:02:33.866
you can view it as a lower
Riemann approximation

00:02:33.866 --> 00:02:34.699
of the curve.

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:36.756
And you can see, they fit under the curve,

00:02:36.756 --> 00:02:38.327
and they leave some area.

00:02:38.327 --> 00:02:41.508
So this is gonna be less
than that expression there.

00:02:41.508 --> 00:02:42.961
Now think about what happens;

00:02:42.961 --> 00:02:43.794
if we know

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.477
that this right over here diverges,

00:02:48.477 --> 00:02:50.822
so if this improper integral diverges, it

00:02:50.822 --> 00:02:53.520
doesn't converge to a finite value,

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.614
well the p-Series is greater than that,

00:02:55.614 --> 00:02:58.550
so if this diverges, then
that's going to diverge.

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:01.955
Similarly, if this converges, the same

00:03:01.955 --> 00:03:03.131
integral right over here,

00:03:03.131 --> 00:03:05.524
if this converges, it
goes to a finite value,

00:03:05.524 --> 00:03:08.520
well one plus that is
still going to converge,

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.227
so this, or p-Series must also converge,

00:03:11.227 --> 00:03:13.644
it must go to a finite value.

00:03:15.028 --> 00:03:16.660
All I'm talking about right here, this

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.054
is really just the integral
test, when we think

00:03:19.054 --> 00:03:21.213
about tests of convergence and divergence,

00:03:21.213 --> 00:03:23.805
but I'm just making
sure that we have a nice

00:03:23.805 --> 00:03:25.818
conceptual understanding, and not just

00:03:25.818 --> 00:03:28.509
blindly applying the integral test.

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:30.419
And you could go the other way too,

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:33.348
if the p-Series converges,
then for sure this

00:03:33.348 --> 00:03:36.033
integral is going to converge, and if the

00:03:36.033 --> 00:03:38.165
p-Series diverges, then for sure

00:03:38.165 --> 00:03:39.658
this expression right
over here is going to

00:03:39.658 --> 00:03:42.201
diverge and the integral diverges.

00:03:42.201 --> 00:03:45.145
So we can say the p-Series converges if,

00:03:45.145 --> 00:03:48.734
and only if, this integral right over here

00:03:48.734 --> 00:03:49.971
converges.

00:03:49.971 --> 00:03:52.439
So, figuring out under what conditions

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:55.139
for what P does the p-Series converge,

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:56.963
it's boiling down to under what conditions

00:03:56.963 --> 00:03:59.228
does this integral converge?

00:03:59.228 --> 00:04:02.354
So let's scroll on down to
give us some real estate

00:04:02.354 --> 00:04:04.537
to think about what
has to be true for that

00:04:04.537 --> 00:04:06.324
integral to converge.

00:04:06.324 --> 00:04:08.094
So I'm gonna re-write it.

00:04:08.094 --> 00:04:10.357
So we've got the integral
from one to infinity,

00:04:10.357 --> 00:04:14.107
improper integral, of
one over X to the P, dX

00:04:15.153 --> 00:04:18.321
this is the same thing, this is the limit

00:04:18.321 --> 00:04:21.162
as, I'll use the variable
M since we're already

00:04:21.162 --> 00:04:24.427
using N, as M approaches infinity,

00:04:24.427 --> 00:04:26.388
and the integral from

00:04:26.388 --> 00:04:30.278
one to M of one over,

00:04:30.278 --> 00:04:33.188
and actually just let me
write that as X to the -P.

00:04:33.188 --> 00:04:36.500
X to the negative P, dX.

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:37.933
And let me just focus on this, and we'll

00:04:37.933 --> 00:04:39.167
just remember that we're
gonna have to take the

00:04:39.167 --> 00:04:41.379
limit as M approaches infinity

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:42.721
I don't wanna have to keep writing that

00:04:42.721 --> 00:04:44.719
over and over again.

00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:46.016
So let's think about what this is,

00:04:46.016 --> 00:04:48.849
so there's a couple of conditions;

00:04:48.849 --> 00:04:51.669
we know that P is greater than zero,

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:54.092
but there's two situations
right over here:

00:04:54.092 --> 00:04:57.171
there's one situation
when P is equal to one.

00:04:57.171 --> 00:04:59.353
If P is equal to one,
then this is just the

00:04:59.353 --> 00:05:02.273
integral of one over X, and so this thing

00:05:02.273 --> 00:05:05.523
is going to be the integral of ln of X,

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:10.005
and we're gonna go from one to M,

00:05:10.005 --> 00:05:13.690
and so this would be the natural log, of M

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:15.970
minus the natural log of one, well E

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:18.083
to the zero power is
one, so the natural log,

00:05:18.083 --> 00:05:18.916
I'll write it out,

00:05:18.916 --> 00:05:20.599
the natural log of one, but the natural

00:05:20.599 --> 00:05:22.014
log of one is just zero,

00:05:22.014 --> 00:05:24.758
so in this special case,
I guess we can say,

00:05:24.758 --> 00:05:26.007
when P equals one,

00:05:26.007 --> 00:05:29.068
this integral, from one to M, comes down

00:05:29.068 --> 00:05:31.066
to the natural log of M.

00:05:31.066 --> 00:05:33.202
Now let's think about the situation

00:05:33.202 --> 00:05:37.247
where P does not equal one,

00:05:37.247 --> 00:05:38.809
well there we're just
kind of reversing the

00:05:38.809 --> 00:05:40.524
power rule that we learned in basic

00:05:40.524 --> 00:05:41.627
differentiation.

00:05:41.627 --> 00:05:43.442
So we'd increment that exponent,

00:05:43.442 --> 00:05:47.071
so it'd be X to the negative P plus one,

00:05:47.071 --> 00:05:49.115
and we can even write that as

00:05:49.115 --> 00:05:52.233
X to the one minus P,
that's the same thing

00:05:52.233 --> 00:05:54.143
as negative P plus one,

00:05:54.143 --> 00:05:55.757
then we would divide by that.

00:05:55.757 --> 00:05:57.090
So one, minus P.

00:06:00.659 --> 00:06:04.326
We are gonna go from one to M,

00:06:04.326 --> 00:06:06.229
and so this is going to be equal to,

00:06:06.229 --> 00:06:07.688
we could write this as

00:06:07.688 --> 00:06:10.740
M to the one minus P,

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:13.230
over one minus P

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:16.852
minus, one to the one minus P,

00:06:16.852 --> 00:06:18.269
over one minus P.

00:06:19.454 --> 00:06:21.522
So now let's state the limits,

00:06:21.522 --> 00:06:23.945
so remember this integral,
we won't take the

00:06:23.945 --> 00:06:25.453
anti-derivative or the
definite integral here,

00:06:25.453 --> 00:06:26.758
but then we want to take the limit here as

00:06:26.758 --> 00:06:28.125
M approaches infinity.

00:06:28.125 --> 00:06:31.958
So what is the limit as
M approaches infinity,

00:06:32.863 --> 00:06:34.113
of natural log,

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:38.551
of M?

00:06:38.551 --> 00:06:40.686
Well if M goes unbounded to infinity,

00:06:40.686 --> 00:06:42.527
well the natural log
of that is still going

00:06:42.527 --> 00:06:45.603
to go to infinity.

00:06:45.603 --> 00:06:48.436
So when P equals one, this
thing doesn't converge,

00:06:48.436 --> 00:06:50.936
this thing is just unbounded.

00:06:50.936 --> 00:06:55.103
So, P equals one, we diverge.

00:06:56.806 --> 00:06:58.072
So we know that.

00:06:58.072 --> 00:06:59.604
So now let's look over here,

00:06:59.604 --> 00:07:01.404
let's think about

00:07:01.404 --> 00:07:05.308
the limit as M approaches infinity,

00:07:05.308 --> 00:07:07.565
of this expression right over here.

00:07:07.565 --> 00:07:09.742
And the only part that's
really effected by

00:07:09.742 --> 00:07:11.602
the limit, is the part that has M,

00:07:11.602 --> 00:07:13.271
so we could even write
this as, we could take

00:07:13.271 --> 00:07:16.096
this one over one minus P out of this,

00:07:16.096 --> 00:07:19.212
we could say one over one minus P,

00:07:19.212 --> 00:07:20.924
times the limit as M approaches infinity,

00:07:20.924 --> 00:07:23.317
of M to the one minus P,

00:07:23.317 --> 00:07:25.564
and then separately we can subtract

00:07:25.564 --> 00:07:28.212
one to the one minus P, for any exponent

00:07:28.212 --> 00:07:30.247
that's just gonna be one,

00:07:30.247 --> 00:07:32.296
over one minus P.

00:07:32.296 --> 00:07:33.129
Is that right?

00:07:33.129 --> 00:07:34.977
Yeah no matter what exponent I put up here

00:07:34.977 --> 00:07:38.426
one to any power is going to be one.

00:07:38.426 --> 00:07:40.530
And so the interesting thing about whether

00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:44.116
it converges or not is,
this part of the expression.

00:07:44.116 --> 00:07:46.147
And it's all going to
depend on whether this

00:07:46.147 --> 00:07:49.252
exponent is positive or negative.

00:07:49.252 --> 00:07:53.252
If one minus P is greater than zero,

00:07:55.207 --> 00:07:56.925
if I'm going to infinity and I'm taking

00:07:56.925 --> 00:08:00.505
that thing to a positive exponent,

00:08:00.505 --> 00:08:02.353
then this is going to diverge.

00:08:02.353 --> 00:08:04.537
So in this situation we diverge, and

00:08:04.537 --> 00:08:05.817
one minus P is greater than zero we can

00:08:05.817 --> 00:08:08.331
add P to both sides, that's the situation,

00:08:08.331 --> 00:08:11.541
that's the same thing as one being greater

00:08:11.541 --> 00:08:14.995
than P, or P being less than one,

00:08:14.995 --> 00:08:17.690
we are going to diverge.

00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:19.304
So far we know that P is
going to be greater than

00:08:19.304 --> 00:08:22.154
zero, and we saw if P
is one, or if it's less

00:08:22.154 --> 00:08:24.253
than one, we're gonna diverge.

00:08:24.253 --> 00:08:26.678
But if this exponent right
over here is negative,

00:08:26.678 --> 00:08:30.258
if one minus P is less than zero,

00:08:30.258 --> 00:08:32.815
well think about it, then it's gonna be

00:08:32.815 --> 00:08:35.486
one over M to some positive exponent,

00:08:35.486 --> 00:08:37.088
is one way to think about it.

00:08:37.088 --> 00:08:38.428
So as M approaches infinity, this

00:08:38.428 --> 00:08:40.655
whole thing is going to approach zero.

00:08:40.655 --> 00:08:42.556
So this is actually
going to be a situation

00:08:42.556 --> 00:08:45.952
where we converge, where
we get to a finite value.

00:08:45.952 --> 00:08:47.375
And so we add P to both sides,

00:08:47.375 --> 00:08:51.522
we have one is less than P, we converge.

00:08:51.522 --> 00:08:53.053
So there you have it, we have established,

00:08:53.053 --> 00:08:56.066
this integral is going to converge only in

00:08:56.066 --> 00:08:58.819
the situation where P is greater than one.

00:08:58.819 --> 00:09:01.236
P&gt;1 you're going to converge.

00:09:02.522 --> 00:09:07.287
And if zero is less than P
is less than or equal to one,

00:09:07.287 --> 00:09:09.035
you are going to diverge.

00:09:09.035 --> 00:09:10.702
And those are then the exact,

00:09:10.702 --> 00:09:12.883
cause this, our p-Series converges if

00:09:12.883 --> 00:09:15.345
and only if, this integral converges.

00:09:15.345 --> 00:09:17.810
And so these exact same constraints

00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:20.700
apply to our original p-Series.

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:23.204
Our original p-Series converges

00:09:23.204 --> 00:09:24.627
only in the situation where

00:09:24.627 --> 00:09:28.628
P is greater than one, then we converge.

00:09:28.628 --> 00:09:32.324
And if zero is less than P
is less than or equal to one,

00:09:32.324 --> 00:09:35.574
we diverge, there you go.
