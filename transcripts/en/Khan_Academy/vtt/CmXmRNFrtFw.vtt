00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:01.940
Welcome back.

00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:05.730
Where I had just left off we
were trying to figure out this

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.460
area between these two curves,
and we figured out that it's

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.440
really the area between the
curves between the point 0,

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.520
x equals 0 and x equals 1.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.840
And I was proposing
of a way to do it.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.620
Let's figure out the entire
area under the square root of

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:26.570
x from 0 to 1, and we can
subtract from that, this

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.580
purple area, which is the
area under x squared.

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.220
So just based on the last
example we did, we could just

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.490
write the indefinite integral,
and I'm not going to rewrite

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:36.970
the fundamental theorem from
calculus, because I think

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:38.770
you know that by now.

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:41.080
Let me do it in a loud color.

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:42.120
Magenta.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.770
So I want to know the
larger area, right.

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:47.355
The area under just
the square root of x.

00:00:47.355 --> 00:00:49.660
That's Kind of like
the combined area.

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:58.710
Well that's just from 0 to 1,
the integral of square root of

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.050
x, because square root of x
is the green function, dx.

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:13.020
And I want to subtract from
that the area from 0 to 1

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.450
what's under x squared.

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.110
x squared dx.

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:19.240
And I just want
to make a point.

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.420
This could have just been
rewritten this way.

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.330
You could just rewrite a new
function, which is the

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.410
difference of these two
functions, and it would

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:26.120
have been equivalent.

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.070
You could have said this.

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:28.820
This isn't kind of a step of
the problem, but you could

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:29.520
have done it this way.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.080
In fact, some people
start this way.

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.960
See those are the same thing
as the integral from 0 to 1

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:42.120
of square root of x
minus x squared dx.

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.720
So you could do this two
separate problems, two separate

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.450
indefinite integrals, or
you could do it as one

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:48.080
indefinite integral.

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.800
Actually that might be even
simpler because when you

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.620
evaluate it from 1 to 0 it
simplify things a little bit.

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:54.150
So let's stick with
the second one.

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:55.710
So first of all we just have
to figure out what the

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.930
antiderivative of this
inner expression is.

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.720
So you haven't seen
square root of x yet.

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.100
Do you think you
know how to do it?

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.480
Well, I think you do.

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:10.060
Let's say that equals square
root of x is just x to

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:11.940
the 1/2 power, right?

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.020
So we just use the same
antiderivative rules

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:15.160
we've always used.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:21.110
We raise it one more power
so it becomes x to the 3/2.

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.230
Right, it was 1/2,
we added 1 to it.

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.860
And then we divide by
this new exponent.

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.370
So dividing by a fraction
is like multiplying

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.920
by its reciprocal.

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:36.840
So it's 2/3 x to the 3/2 and
then minus-- I think the second

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:42.780
term is pretty easy for you--
minus 1/3 x to the third.

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.250
That's the antiderivative
of minus x squared, minus

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.200
1/3 x to the third.

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:56.120
And we're going to have to
evaluate this thing at 0 and 1

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.770
and subtract the difference.

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:01.040
Subtract this expression
evaluated at 0 from this

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.030
expression evaluated at 1.

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:05.080
I think I'm running
out of space.

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.070
What happens when x equals 1?

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:08.810
1 to the 3/2 is 1.

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:09.755
1 to the third is 1.

00:03:09.755 --> 00:03:11.130
So it's 2/3 minus 1/3.

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:12.370
Well that's easy.

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.180
It's 1/3.

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.030
I just put 1 in for x.

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.470
And then when x is equal to 0
what is this expression equal?

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:20.700
Well that's easy too.

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.530
That's 0.

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:23.720
So there you go.

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.520
1/3 minus 0 or 1/3.

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:27.610
That's kind of neat.

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.940
You know I find is this of
exciting because if just my

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.940
intuition I was like, oh I have
these two curves, and I mean

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.320
they do intersect at the nice
integer number, but you know

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.830
what it's probably going to be
some really messy number

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:49.560
of what the areas between
these two curves, right.

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.990
Who knows, maybe it'll involve
some you know-- a circle

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:54.750
involves pi, which is this
really messy number, so maybe

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.100
all curves have these
kind of messy areas.

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.830
But this one it's just one of
those neat things about math.

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:05.360
The area between the square
root of x and x squared is 1/3,

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.000
which is a pretty clean number.

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:13.100
Actually let me do one more
problem since I have time.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:19.250
It's a bit of a trick problem.

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:24.970
I mean, you might actually find
this easy, but let's figure out

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:38.310
the area between f of x
is equal to-- I don't

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:41.130
know, x to the fifth.

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:42.120
I'm going to do
something simple.

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.645
Let me draw it actually.

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:58.730
OK, I'm going to
draw the x-axis.

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:06.990
x to the fifth is going
to go up super fast,

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.780
something like that.

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:09.220
It's going to go up real fast.

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:10.640
Let's say I wanted to figure
out the areas-- this side's

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:13.930
going to go real fast too--
between that, and instead of

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:19.180
figuring out the area between
x-axis and that, f of x, I want

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:28.730
to figure out the area between
f of x and-- Instead

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:31.530
of figuring out this
bottom area, right?

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:34.380
Like the normal problems we've
done, we would figure out this

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:36.950
type of area, you know,
between two points.

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:49.710
Let's say I want to figure out
the area inside of the curve

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:56.090
where the height here is 32.

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:59.790
So I want to figure out this
area inside the curve.

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:02.070
How do we do that?

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:05.010
Well one way we could do it is
just like we did the last one,

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:07.970
we can figure out some function
that's essentially a line, a

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:11.030
horizontal line that goes
straight across here.

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:14.800
And we'll essentially just
be figuring out the area

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.050
between the two functions.

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:18.460
So what's a function that's
a line that just goes

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:20.820
straight at y equals 32?

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:23.000
I think I just gave
you the answer.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.720
Exactly.

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:28.580
Let me stick with
that greenish color.

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:32.200
So we could say g of
x is equal to 32.

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:33.415
It's just a constant function.

00:06:33.415 --> 00:06:35.510
It just goes straight across.

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:38.310
And then we need to figure out
what the area is between the

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:40.050
two, so we need to figure out
what are these two points.

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:47.240
So when does x to
the fifth equal 32?

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:50.000
I mean you could solve it
algebraically, you know,

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.954
you could say x to
the fifth equals 32.

00:06:53.954 --> 00:07:03.420
x is equal to 2, and
actually, you know what?

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:05.020
I made a mistake.

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:07.760
Let's say that this is not
equal to x to the fifth.

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:10.950
Let's say that f of x is
equal to x to the absolute

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:13.270
value of x to the fifth.

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:15.590
Because the mistake, obviously
x to the fifth is not a

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:17.420
parabola looking thing.
x to the fifth goes

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:18.630
negative like this.

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:22.070
But I have committed so much to
this cup shape that I'll make

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:24.350
it the absolute value
of x to the fifth.

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:27.290
So if I say the absolute value
of x to the fifth is equal to

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:30.170
32, I think you see where
I realized my mistake.

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:33.280
But if I say the absolute value
of x to the fifth is 32,

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:35.800
there's two places
where that's true.

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:38.430
It's x is equal to
plus or minus 2.

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:39.670
These are the two points.

00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:41.795
I should have done something
with an even exponent so I

00:07:41.795 --> 00:07:43.520
could have had this cup shape,
but anyway the absolute

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:46.280
value solved my problem.

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:48.740
So what is this area?

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:51.180
We know it's between negative
2 and 2, so we just set up

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:52.300
the indefinite integral.

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:59.210
It's the indefinite integral
for minus 2 to 2 of the top

00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:04.350
function, the top boundary, 32,
minus the bottom boundary.

00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:11.270
Well, this will be a little bit
tricky, but minus the absolute

00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:16.360
value of x to the fifth dx.

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:18.660
And actually instead of doing
this, I think you could see

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:21.160
that there's symmetry here,
so we could just figure out

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:23.690
this area and multiply by 2.

00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:27.223
This problem's a little hairy,
just because I had a bad

00:08:27.223 --> 00:08:29.160
choice of initial function.

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:32.410
Not exactly what I wanted,
but we'll work on forward.

00:08:32.410 --> 00:08:38.640
So instead of doing that, let's
do the integral from 0 to 2 of

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:45.020
32 minus x to the fifth dx.

00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:47.340
And then multiply that by 2.

00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:48.060
So what is that?

00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:56.060
That's 32x minus x to
the sixth over 6.

00:08:56.060 --> 00:09:05.720
And we're going to evaluate it
from 2 and 0 at 64 minus 64/6.

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:13.860
2 to the sixth is 64, and
then 32 times 0 is 0 and the

00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:20.370
next is 6, that's 0, so the
answer is 64 minus 64/6.

00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:21.880
I'm about to run out of time.

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:23.320
That's just a fraction
problem there.

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:25.230
Oh, and that's half
of it, right?

00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:27.370
So we want to
multiply that by 2.

00:09:27.370 --> 00:09:34.290
So if we multiply that by
2, we get 128 minus 128/6.

00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:35.980
I haven't figured
out what it is.

00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:36.850
Well I guess we could
figure it out.

00:09:36.850 --> 00:09:45.840
It's 128 times 1 minus
1/6 or 128 times 5/6.

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:48.280
And I don't know what that is.

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:51.100
I can multiply if I wanted to,
but I have 10 seconds left

00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:52.400
so I'll leave you there.

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:53.365
Hope I didn't confuse you.

00:09:53.365 --> 00:09:54.170
See you soon.
