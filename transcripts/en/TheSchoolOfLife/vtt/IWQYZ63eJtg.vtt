00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:07.009
We live in an age increasingly prepared to
see hurtful aspects lurking within many apparently

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:14.019
so-called minor situations, and ready to lend
greater public acknowledgement to what had

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:20.680
previously been merely private pains. It is
in this context that we should give due recognition

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:26.530
to a truly grave hurt that can unfold, within
established relationships, when there is almost

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:32.769
no touch left between the parties, when one
partner repeatedly moves to hold the other’s

00:00:32.769 --> 00:00:38.789
hand, or perhaps caress their shoulder or
waist – and receives no response at all,

00:00:38.789 --> 00:00:42.010
or a subtle turn away and withdrawal.

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.300
We’re not talking here of the more obvious
and well-known problem of a lack of sex (though

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:52.659
this may be present too), but of the long-term
and arguably equally serious or even greater

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:58.949
hurt that can ensue when one partner’s body
as a whole becomes somehow unreceptive to,

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:05.160
or uninterested in, the other’s touch. We
know, of course, how much this is awkward

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:11.160
on an early date. We’re ready, at a cultural
level, to give due weight to a minor physical

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:17.250
rejection when it happens around a potential
new partner. But there is as much loneliness

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:24.200
and agony within settled couples around unheld
hands, except that here it feels a great deal

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:30.070
more embarrassing and more humiliating even
to raise the issue. Perplexingly, the very

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:35.391
person who quietly withdraws their hand or
leaves it agonisingly limp in our own, can

00:01:35.391 --> 00:01:40.440
also be the one who is named in our will,
with whom we share a mortgage and to whom

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:47.250
we have given over our emotional lives. How
devastating to self-confidence an inert hand

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:54.970
can be in this situation. Lifeless in ours,
it plays into every anxiety about unacceptability,

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:00.710
exploitation and rejection. But precisely
because it is so devastating, it becomes impossibly

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:06.630
hard to discuss in any fruitful way. We are
liable either to say nothing at all, or else

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:12.230
to express our hurt through bitterness and
sarcasm. We cannot stay long enough with the

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:18.060
pain we feel to share it – and try to correct
it – with the partner themselves. We may

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:24.220
find it wholly beyond us to develop the authority,
self-belief and legitimacy to say: you didn’t

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.760
take my hand after dinner, you never touch
me of your own accord – and it is driving

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:35.260
me slowly but definitively insane. We don’t
have this kind of offence mapped on our chart

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.760
of acceptable verbalisable unhappiness, it
doesn’t feel like a toll we have a language

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.290
for or the right to.

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:49.760
And yet, we should, despite our anxieties,
retain the courage and conviction of our feelings.

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.441
An inert hand or a lack of touch, is truly
as serious a problem as we feel it is. The

00:02:54.441 --> 00:02:59.930
request to be held and physically acknowledged
is a subject of deep gravity, rooted in our

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:05.540
capacity to tolerate and like ourselves. We
should not compound our misery by a sense

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.750
that we are not allowed to feel or share it.
Then, when we can manage it, we should learn

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.569
to pick up the partner’s hand with a newfound
confidence and say that the little flinch

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:21.380
or inertness we feel when we do so is a huge
problem for us, that what they may blithely

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:26.020
dismiss as ‘this touching business’ is
part of why we’re in a relationship in the

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:31.120
first place, that it matters as much as anything
else does to us and that if they care at all

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:37.290
for us or the continuance of the union, then
they will have to take the pain on board at

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:43.260
last. We should have the bravery finally to
know in our hearts that this ‘small’ thing

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:49.001
is not small at all: it may be quite simply
integral to how we know we’re loved – and

00:03:49.001 --> 00:03:53.280
how and when we feel we’re not.

00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:02.400
