who I believe are cursed by being

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:21.949
who I believe are cursed by being
 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:23.979
who I believe are cursed by being
multi-talented and I do feel like that

00:00:23.979 --> 00:00:23.989
multi-talented and I do feel like that
 

00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:25.929
multi-talented and I do feel like that
is a curse or if you're not cursed by

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:25.939
is a curse or if you're not cursed by

is a curse or if you're not cursed by
being multi-talented I know people who

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:27.860
being multi-talented I know people who
 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:29.530
being multi-talented I know people who
are cursed by having many different

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:29.540
are cursed by having many different
 

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:32.860
are cursed by having many different
interests so their attention is kind of

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:32.870
interests so their attention is kind of
 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.770
interests so their attention is kind of
fragmented across many fields and I

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:35.780
fragmented across many fields and I
 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.029
fragmented across many fields and I
think it's difficult when you're like

00:00:37.029 --> 00:00:37.039

that unless you're truly a Renaissance
person and you can kind of handle all of

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:40.489
person and you can kind of handle all of
 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:42.700
person and you can kind of handle all of
it at once I think it's hard to sort of

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:42.710
it at once I think it's hard to sort of
 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.500
it at once I think it's hard to sort of
find your way and you know I just never

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:46.510
find your way and you know I just never
 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.090

was interested in anything else I was
 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.860
was interested in anything else I was
never particularly good at anything else

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030
much as this work so in that one way I
 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:00.419
much as this work so in that one way I
would say that my life has been

00:01:00.419 --> 00:01:00.429
would say that my life has been
 

00:01:00.429 --> 00:01:03.009
would say that my life has been

phenomenally simple I've managed to
 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:04.360
phenomenally simple I've managed to
complicate my life and all sorts of

complicate my life and all sorts of
 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:07.719
complicate my life and all sorts of
other ways but but just this was a kind

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:14.510
handed as a simple gift and and for me
 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:19.690
handed as a simple gift and and for me
it was this this whole idea of writing

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700
 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.240

I follow my curiosity I suppose that's
 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.609
I follow my curiosity I suppose that's
where most people's creative processes

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:24.619
where most people's creative processes
 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:28.389
where most people's creative processes
begin unless they're sort of more

00:01:28.389 --> 00:01:28.399
begin unless they're sort of more
 

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:30.580
begin unless they're sort of more
analytical and intellectual about it and

she was kind of like Scheherazade you
 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:13.030
she was kind of like Scheherazade you
know she can just invent things and make

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040
know she can just invent things and make

up worlds and I've never been that kind

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870
up worlds and I've never been that kind
 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.890
up worlds and I've never been that kind
of person my interest is much more about

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900
of person my interest is much more about
 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.530
of person my interest is much more about
reflecting on the world as it is and

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540
reflecting on the world as it is and
 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.660
reflecting on the world as it is and
even when I was writing fiction I felt

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670
even when I was writing fiction I felt
 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.520
even when I was writing fiction I felt
like I had to go to the places that I

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530
like I had to go to the places that I
 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:25.900
like I had to go to the places that I
was writing about and roll around in

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910
was writing about and roll around in
 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.180
was writing about and roll around in
them for a while and and you know just

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190
them for a while and and you know just
 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:29.650
them for a while and and you know just
really commune with the people there and

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660
really commune with the people there and
 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.650
really commune with the people there and
like taste the soil you know and learn

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660
like taste the soil you know and learn
 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.360
like taste the soil you know and learn
about it and so my creative process is

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370
about it and so my creative process is
 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.129
about it and so my creative process is
really it's really involving you know

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:36.139
really it's really involving you know
 

00:02:36.139 --> 00:02:37.690
really it's really involving you know
it's really about that kind of all over

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700
it's really about that kind of all over
 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.590
it's really about that kind of all over
sentient sensory experience and and I

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600
sentient sensory experience and and I
 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.050
sentient sensory experience and and I
can't begin to write something until I

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060
can't begin to write something until I
 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.090
can't begin to write something until I
feel like I've become a bit of an expert

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100
feel like I've become a bit of an expert
 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.180
feel like I've become a bit of an expert
on it so the writing comes last and and

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190
on it so the writing comes last and and
 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.009
on it so the writing comes last and and
it's all this build-up all this research

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:51.019
it's all this build-up all this research
 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:52.479
it's all this build-up all this research
all this thinking all this contemplation

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489
all this thinking all this contemplation
 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:55.120
all this thinking all this contemplation
all this experimentation and then once

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130
all this experimentation and then once
 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.670
all this experimentation and then once
I've got this collective of ideas and

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680
I've got this collective of ideas and
 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.160
I've got this collective of ideas and
information and notes I can sit down and

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170
information and notes I can sit down and
 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.949
information and notes I can sit down and
at that point it starts to feel like I'm

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959
at that point it starts to feel like I'm
 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:05.110
at that point it starts to feel like I'm
an archaeologist and that underneath all

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120
an archaeologist and that underneath all
 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.699
an archaeologist and that underneath all
of those notes there's an ancient city

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709
of those notes there's an ancient city
 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:08.620
of those notes there's an ancient city
and I just have to kind of dust it and

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630
and I just have to kind of dust it and
 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:10.360
and I just have to kind of dust it and
find it and piece it together and put

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370
find it and piece it together and put
 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.160
find it and piece it together and put
the pieces of pottery and shards and

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170
the pieces of pottery and shards and
 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.809
the pieces of pottery and shards and
kind of recreate it in some strange and

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:16.819
kind of recreate it in some strange and
 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:20.769
kind of recreate it in some strange and
kind of indescribable way
