00:00:01.449 --> 00:00:05.790
Polite people have it instilled in them from
an early age that they should not talk too

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.879
much about themselves. A few comments aside,
they should – to prove appealing – always

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:16.520
ask the other about their lives or stick to
impersonal topics found in newspapers, lest

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:23.080
they be accused of that heinous charge: self-absorption.
But this rule fails to distinguish between

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:28.850
different ways of talking about oneself. There
are, as well-mannered people sometimes forget,

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:33.980
better and worse ways to share details of
one’s life. It is not the amount that one

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:40.160
talks that should determine the issue; only
how one does so. There is one particular way

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:46.220
of discussing oneself which, however long
it goes on for, never fails to win one friends,

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:51.030
reassure audiences, comfort couples, bring
solace to the single and buy one the goodwill

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:57.750
of enemies: the confession of vulnerability
and error. To hear that we have failed, that

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.260
we are sad, that it was our fault, that our
partners don’t seem to like us much, that

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.890
we are lonely, that we have wished it might
all be over – there is scarcely anything

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:13.479
nicer anyone could learn. This is often taken
to signal a basic nastiness in human nature,

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:18.189
but the truth is more poignant. We are not
so much crowing when we hear of failure as

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:23.939
deeply reassured – reassured to know that
we aren’t humiliatingly alone with the appalling

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:29.100
difficulties of being alive. It is all too
easy to suspect that we have been uniquely

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.970
cursed in the extent of our troubles, of which
we seldom find evidence in the lives around

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:39.740
us. The media offers us unending accounts
of the financial and creative success of others,

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.520
while our friends and acquaintances constantly
pepper their conversations with ever-so subtle

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.909
boasts about their and their children’s
accomplishments. By an ultimate irony, these

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:54.719
self-promoters aren’t trying to alienate
us. They are labouring under the touching

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:59.680
but seriously misguided impression that we
will like them more for their success. They

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:05.810
are applying to social life a model of a relationship
between popularity and success that in fact

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:11.150
only applies in very selective contexts, perhaps
when we seek to please our parents or need

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.689
the help of successful people to advance our
careers. But the rest of the time, as the

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:22.890
boasters forget, we find success an enormous
problem. We put in so much effort to be perfect.

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:28.129
But the irony is that it’s failure that
charms, because others so need to hear external

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:34.299
evidence of problems with which we are all
too lonely: how un-normal our sex lives are;

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:39.180
how misguided our careers are proving; how
unsatisfactory our family can be; how worried

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:44.850
we are pretty much all the time. Revealing
any of these wounds might, of course, place

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:49.750
us in great danger. Others could laugh; social
media could have a field day. That’s the

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:55.250
point. We get close by revealing things that
would, in the wrong hands, be capable of inflicting

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:00.579
humiliation on us. Friendship is the dividend
of gratitude that flows from an acknowledgement

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:06.140
that one has offered something very valuable
to someone by talking: not a fancy present,

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.850
but something even more precious, the key
to one’s self-esteem and dignity. It’s

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:15.170
deeply poignant that we should expend so much
effort on trying to look strong before the

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:20.480
world – when, all the while, it’s really
only ever the revelation of the somewhat embarrassing,

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:26.180
sad, melancholy and anxious bits of us that
is what makes us endearing to others, and

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.560
transforms strangers into friends.
