00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:05.340
So we have matrix D and matrix
B and they ask us is DB defined?

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:08.150
Is the product D
times B defined?

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:10.740
So D times B is
going to be defined

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.317
is if-- let me make
this very clear.

00:00:13.317 --> 00:00:14.525
This is how I think about it.

00:00:14.525 --> 00:00:15.941
So let me copy and
paste this so I

00:00:15.941 --> 00:00:18.840
can do this on my scratch pad.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.700
So to answer that
question, get out

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.230
the scratch pad right over here.

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.800
Let me paste the
question right here.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.580
So let's think about
these two matrices.

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:36.640
You first have matrix D. I'll
do this a nice bold D here.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.700
And it has three rows
and three columns.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.330
So it is a 3 by 3 matrix.

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:46.250
And then you'll want to multiply
that times matrix B. Matrix

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:52.200
B is a 2 by 2 matrix.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.500
The only way that we know to
define matrix multiplication

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.330
is if these middle two
numbers are the same.

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:03.090
If the number of columns D has
is equal to the number of rows

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.860
B has.

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.480
Now in this case, they clearly
do not equal each other,

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.250
so matrix multiplication
is not defined here.

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.322
So let's go back
there and say no.

00:01:13.322 --> 00:01:15.580
No, DB is not defined.

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.200
Let's do a few more
of these examples.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.440
So then we have a 2 by 1,
you could view this is as a 2

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.210
by 1 matrix or you could
view this as a column vector.

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.370
This is another 2 by 1
matrix, or a column vector.

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:29.180
Is C plus B defined.

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.500
Well, matrix addition is
defined if both matrices have

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.300
the exact same dimensions,
and these two matrices

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:36.780
do have the exact
same dimensions.

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.905
And the reason why is
because with matrix addition,

00:01:38.905 --> 00:01:40.590
you just add every
corresponding term.

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.540
So in the sum the
top, it'll actually

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.680
be 4 plus 0 over negative 2 plus
0, which is still just going

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.124
to be the same thing
as this matrix up here.

00:01:48.124 --> 00:01:49.790
But what they're
asking is this defined?

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:54.080
Absolutely, these both
are 2 by 1 matrices,

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.260
so yes, it is defined.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.342
Let's do one more.

00:01:58.342 --> 00:01:59.800
So once again,
they're asking us is

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.470
the product A times E defined?

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.360
So here you have
a 2 by 2 matrix.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.110
Let me copy and paste this
just so we can make sure

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.086
that we know what
we're talking about.

00:02:12.086 --> 00:02:14.040
So get my scratch pad out.

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:24.100
So this top matrix right
over here, so matrix A is a 2

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.740
by 2 matrix.

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.160
And matrix E, so we're
going to multiply it

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.910
times matrix E, which has
one row and two columns.

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:36.900
So in this scenario
once again, the number

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.470
of rows-- sorry-- the number
of columns matrix A has is two

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.620
and the number of rows
matrix E has is one,

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.920
so this will not be defined.

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.617
These two things have to be the
same for them to be defined.

00:02:49.617 --> 00:02:51.950
Now, what is interesting is,
if you did it the other way

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:58.770
around, if you took E
times A, let's check

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:00.860
if this would have been defined.

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.250
Matrix E is 1 by 2, one
row times two columns.

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:11.700
Matrix A is a 2 by 2,
two rows and two columns,

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.620
and so this would
have been defined.

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.890
Matrix E has two
columns, which is exactly

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.342
the same number of
rows that matrix A has.

00:03:19.342 --> 00:03:20.800
And this really
hits the point home

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.320
that the order matters
when you multiply matrices.

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.070
But for the sake of this
question, is AE defined?

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:27.670
No, it isn't.

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.800
And so we can check our
answer, no, it isn't.
