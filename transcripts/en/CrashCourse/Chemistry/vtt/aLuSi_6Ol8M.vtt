00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.180
You and I began this journey a year ago when I introduced you to this spectacular method for understanding the world.

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:09.520
While physics explains the mechanics of the
universe,

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:14.660
and biology describes how life functions and
interacts with itself, chemistry lies between.

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.760
In our next course we are excited to announce
that we're gonna to be exploring psychology,

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.720
the study of human mental functions and behavior.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.060
Chemistry has brought us great insights into
even such complicated sciences as psychology,

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.330
like how neurotransmitters allow us to feel
anxiety, and hormones give us our desires.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.420
But before we drill down into the level of
your brain and blood stream,

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.149
I want to close out this course with a talk
about chemistry on a global scale.

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:41.559
Certainly larger than your mind - though I'm
not sure it's more complicated!

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:44.519
It is complicated though.
And also terrifying.

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:46.850
Let's talk about a little thing called "Global
Warming"

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.110
and the spiking atmospheric CO2 concentrations
that are causing it.

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:51.240
I'm sure you are aware.

00:00:51.249 --> 00:00:53.699
But awareness isn't the same thing as understanding,

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.690
and if I had one final attempt to persuade
you that chemistry is important, which I do,

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.219
I'd tell you about the carbon cycle, which
is what I'm about to do.

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:06.940
Of all the chemistry that happens on this planet the carbon cycle is the thing that makes Earth "earthy",

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.439
unique among planets that we know and understand.

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:13.719
The early Earth's atmosphere was made up of
Ammonia, Methane, Nitrogen, and Carbon Dioxide

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:17.179
among some other things, but essentially there
was no free oxygen.

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.840
Many of these gasses, including CO2, are what
we call "Greenhouse Gases",

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.969
because they absorb heat energy thus increasing
the average temperature on earth.

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:27.570
When plants came along with their fancy photosynthesis,

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.450
they used up most of the carbon dioxide in
the atmosphere.

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.130
They used that carbon to make life, turning
carbon dioxide into a rare commodity,

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.719
while producing huge amounts of oxygen to
create a whole new atmosphere.

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:42.460
These changes served not only to open up the
earth's atmosphere,

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.840
allowing huge amounts of head to radiate back
into space,

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:52.820
they also created a huge reservoir of highly energetic organic forms of carbon that are used as fuel by living things.

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.160
Including us.

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:59.460
Organic carbon, or in the language of chemists "reduced carbon", is natures equivalent of a battery.

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.500
Organisms can draw power by feeding on organic
carbon compounds

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.989
and then oxidizing the reduced carbon back
to carbon dioxide.

00:02:06.989 --> 00:02:12.380
Lots of organisms are good at this. No organisms are as good at this as we have become.

00:02:12.389 --> 00:02:15.840
Carbon's role in the biology and physics of
our planet is unparalleled.

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:19.730
It's the main route for the transfer of energy
between organisms,

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.630
and it's the main way that we trap heat in
our atmosphere,

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.650
and that's why when we talk about global warming
we talk about carbon:

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.840
carbon footprints, carbon credits, carbon
loading.

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.920
So, let's wrap up our study of the chemical universe by going not all the way back to square 1, but square 6...

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.960
on the periodic table! That's right we have
a periodic table designed by Thought CafÃ©.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.720
It's a beautiful Crash Course: Chemistry period
table, it's quite large, and you want it,

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.300
and it's available for $15 at dftba.com

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:54.800
[Theme Music]

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.600
Since carbon is the stuff of life, one of the best ways of understanding the carbon cycle is

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.880
just a whole bunch of things living and dying,
and in the process swapping carbon.

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.200
Here's the 30 second version:

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.420
Plants use the carbon in the atmospheric CO2 to make sugars and other carbohydrates to grow and reproduce.

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.600
Lots of those plants end up being eaten by
other organisms supplying them with the building

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.410
blocks for other biological molecules and
fuel.

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:19.220
After being metabolized the carbon returns to the environment in one of several different ways,

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.740
ending up in the air, water, or the earth
itself.

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:25.130
From that point it's released naturally or
is extracted by humans;

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:29.860
in either case returning carbon dioxide to
the atmosphere and it starts all over again.

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.680
So let's talk about those green plants and
what is is exactly that they do.

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.510
Photosynthesis is an extremely complex process,

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.760
and it can happen in a couple of different
ways, depending on the organism.

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.820
But the main point is to take in carbon dioxide
from the environment

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:46.690
and use a process called carbon fixation to
convert it to organic compounds such as sugars.

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:51.080
It's called fixation because it takes carbon
in the form of a gas, carbon dioxide,

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:55.550
and solidifies it into solid carbon compounds.
A general reaction looks like this.

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:00.840
Note that CH2O isn't actually a thing, it's a reduced formula that stands for a simple carbohydrate;

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:05.520
a compound that's composed of carbon, and hydrogen, and oxygen at a ratio of 1 to 2 to 1.

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:10.280
In real life there are all kinds of carbohydrates
and they're usually a lot larger,

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.160
but chemists use this streamlined version
to illustrate the basic reaction.

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.220
And the reaction is basically the same with
any hydrocarbon,

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.519
but you've probably seen it written most often
with glucose.

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:23.980
In this form we say that 6 moles of carbon dioxide plus 6 moles of water plus some light energy

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:26.780
yields a mole of glucose plus 6 moles of oxygen.

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:30.280
Either way you might have noticed something
important: this is a redox reaction!

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.320
Carbon is reduced, going from an oxidation
number of plus 4 to 0,

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:40.340
and oxygen goes from negative 2 to 0, meaning
that oxygen is oxidized. It can happen!

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:46.540
And the carbohydrates produced by these carbon fixation reactions are the most sought after currency among earths living things.

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:51.100
Because organisms can use them in 2 different
ways: as building material, and as fuel.

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:55.060
Some carbohydrates go through additional reactions
to become even more complex,

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:59.520
like starches, fats, proteins, nucleic acids,
and all the other stuff that makes up living things.

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.740
Meanwhile other carbohydrates, the ones that
are used to produce energy,

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:05.030
go through a process called cellular respiration.

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:09.340
Like carbon fixation, respiration is an extremely
complex cluster bomb of reactions,

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:12.810
so we typically condense it too down to a
fairly simple reaction.

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:17.340
The overall reaction for respiration is essentially
the reverse of carbon fixation.

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:21.900
A carbohydrate and some oxygen react to produce
carbon dioxide, water, and energy.

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:25.980
Again, this is most commonly written with
glucose, so we'll do that here too.

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:28.580
And like carbon fixation it's also a redox
reaction.

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:34.600
In this case the oxygen is reduced from an oxidation number of 0 to -2, and the carbon is oxidized from 0 to +4.

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:40.460
That's right, the cells of living things re-oxidize the reduced carbon and re-reduce the oxidized oxygen

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:43.370
to produce all the energy that keeps living
things alive.

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:46.650
But despite the fact that these two reactions
look like the exact opposites of each other,

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:50.960
even down to the changes in their oxidation numbers, it's important to remember that they're just summaries.

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:54.780
The overall processes actually include lots of steps that are completely different from each other.

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:59.940
Now after organisms metabolize carbohydrates the carbon can be re-released back into the world in several ways.

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:04.910
For one thing lots of carbon dioxide is released
as a direct product of cellular respiration:

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:07.830
for you and me that happens mostly when we
exhale,

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:11.080
and that carbon dioxide can be recycled immediately
by photosynthesizers.

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:15.940
For organisms that live in water the carbon that they release largely ends up dissolved in that water,

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:20.180
and oceans and other surface water can also dissolve carbon dioxide directly from the air.

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:24.400
No matter how it gets there, carbon dioxide
reacts with water to form carbonic acid;

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:28.000
a weak acid that dissociates into hydrogen
and bicarbonate ions.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.560
The hydrogen ions can react with various rocks and other substances in fairly typical neutralization reactions.

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:38.620
This results in weathering which, besides melting the faces off of statues, produces stuff that forms clays.

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:41.680
But the carbonate ions have a whole bunch
of functions,

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:47.700
especially in marine animals, which use them to build their shells and skeletons in the form of calcium carbonate.

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:52.400
The carbon remains trapped there until those
animals die and their structures break down,

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:55.449
which happens on huge, very slow, geologic
time scales.

00:06:55.449 --> 00:06:59.960
And if the conditions are just right like in the super high pressures and temperatures in the earth's crust,

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:03.840
large deposits of calcium carbonate can eventually
form rocks like limestone.

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:06.350
And before you start thinking rock equals
boring,

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:11.430
you should know that about 80% of all the
carbon on the planet is locked up this way,

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:15.510
as inorganic carbonates in the earths crust
and mantle or lithosphere.

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:20.280
Most of the remaining 20% is spread throughout the lithosphere too, as organic carbon from buried organic matter.

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:26.740
So, those pools of carbonate everyone's so obsessed with, those fossil fuels that we use to power all the things?

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:31.700
They account for only 0.006% of all the carbon
on earth.

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:35.080
Those carbon deposits got there from the dead
bodies of other organisms,

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:39.400
like plants that managed not to be eaten or
have their carbon released some other way.

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:45.260
Hence the name fossil fuels - the dead things that you know today as coal, petroleum, and natural gas.

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:48.080
The general chemical reaction for the combustion
of those fuels is

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:52.900
just a hydrocarbon reacting with molecular
oxygen to form carbon dioxide and water vapour.

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:57.940
For example each mole of methane, the simplest hydrocarbon, reacts to form 1 mole of carbon dioxide.

00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:04.280
And of course this too is a redox reaction, where carbon is oxidized all the way from -4 to +4,

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:06.820
and oxygen is reduced from 0 to -2.

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:09.000
Combustion is an extremely common reaction
type.

00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:12.270
The only change that occurs from one example
to the next is the hydrocarbon,

00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:16.930
and obviously as larger more complex hydrocarbons are used the CO2 production per mole of fuel increases.

00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:18.500
What about gasoline for example?

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:24.840
The combustion of octane, a main ingredient of gasoline, produces 8 moles of carbon dioxide for every 1 mole of fuel used.

00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:30.150
A mole of octane is only about 0.15 liters
or 0.041 gallons,

00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:35.820
but those 8 moles of CO2 take up nearly 180
liters of space at standard pressure and temperature.

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:40.099
This carbon dioxide is released back into the atmosphere where it re-enters the carbon cycle.

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:45.780
The problem with all this is that the environment can only really re-absorb about 40% of the 30 million tons,

00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:48.430
or giga-tons, that humans produce annually,

00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:53.779
so we have a surplus of about 18 giga-tons
of CO2 every single year,

00:08:53.779 --> 00:08:57.180
and that number goes up every single year.

00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:02.399
The excess remains in the atmosphere trapping
the sun's heat causing temperatures to rise.

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:06.680
And yes, there are other greenhouse gases too; methane, ozone, even water vapor, to name a few,

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:10.500
but none of these are increasing in abundance
at nearly the rate that carbon dioxide is.

00:09:10.509 --> 00:09:14.360
The good news is that now you understand the
problem better than you did 10 minutes ago,

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:17.639
and understanding about situations in the
first step to making it better.

00:09:17.639 --> 00:09:20.519
That goes for all situations really, not
just chemistry ones,

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:23.480
so continue to pay attention to what's happening
in the world around you,

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:26.020
keep learning science,
and never stop caring.

00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:29.700
And thank you for the difference you have made by watching this episode of Crash Course: Chemistry,

00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:33.600
and this entire Crash Course: Chemistry course,
which I hope you watched.

00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:37.089
In this episode you learned that the carbon
cycle includes carbon fixation,

00:09:37.089 --> 00:09:42.860
both cellular and macroscopic respiration in living things, and deposition in limestone and fossil fuels,

00:09:42.869 --> 00:09:47.249
and that many of the chemical reactions involved
in the carbon cycle are redox reactions.

00:09:47.249 --> 00:09:49.860
And finally, you learned, from the chemistry
perspective,

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:53.199
exactly why the excessive burning of fossil
fuels harms the environment.

00:09:53.199 --> 00:09:56.110
And I'd especially like to thank all of our
Subbable subscribers,

00:09:56.110 --> 00:09:59.300
