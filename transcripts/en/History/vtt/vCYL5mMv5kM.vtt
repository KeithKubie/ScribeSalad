[music playing]

00:00:01.801 --> 00:00:03.136
MALE SPEAKER: What
I'm eating isn't

00:00:03.136 --> 00:00:05.205
giving me enough energy to
do what I need to do anymore.

00:00:05.205 --> 00:00:08.908
And there comes a point where
it really, really escalates

00:00:08.908 --> 00:00:11.845
into more of a starvation game.

00:00:11.845 --> 00:00:14.881
Normally, I'm catching
fish with grasshoppers.

00:00:14.881 --> 00:00:17.484
But as it's getting colder,
and the grasshopper are getting

00:00:17.484 --> 00:00:20.019
harder to find, then I'm
finding I'm going to have

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:22.389
to do something different.

00:00:22.389 --> 00:00:24.457
And I had an idea to
try and make a lure.

00:00:32.165 --> 00:00:35.468
I took three of my
regular-size solid hooks.

00:00:35.468 --> 00:00:38.304
I bound them together
with my wire.

00:00:38.304 --> 00:00:41.040
I don't have an abundant
amount of hooks.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.876
And I've realized how
important and vital

00:00:42.876 --> 00:00:45.445
they are to, like,
everything that I do.

00:00:45.445 --> 00:00:47.680
About an inch up, I took
some of my paracord,

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.418
and I frayed it all out and
made it like a hula skirt.

00:00:51.418 --> 00:00:54.320
So, yeah, I'll go fishing
with this one tomorrow.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.655
It's not pretty.

00:00:55.655 --> 00:00:56.489
Doesn't have to be pretty.

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.910
[inaudible] this
guy's maiden voyage.

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.412
Not too shabby.

00:01:19.412 --> 00:01:20.079
Very pleased with it.

00:01:23.082 --> 00:01:24.150
I want to stay away
from the trees.

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:31.224
It's a huge difference
between those grasshoppers.

00:01:31.224 --> 00:01:32.559
I have faith in this lure.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.002
That was a strike.

00:01:43.002 --> 00:01:45.472
Here we go.

00:01:45.472 --> 00:01:48.575
Got one.
Oh, yeah.

00:01:52.078 --> 00:01:54.013
Come on.

00:01:54.013 --> 00:01:56.950
Oh, [beep].

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:57.984
I just lost my lure.

00:02:04.657 --> 00:02:05.258
Damn.

00:02:08.761 --> 00:02:12.932
That's a lot of hooks
to lose all at once.

00:02:12.932 --> 00:02:15.301
Running low.

00:02:15.301 --> 00:02:17.637
That's just--
that's unacceptable.

00:02:21.074 --> 00:02:25.478
Well, my fishing game just
took a significant blow.

00:02:25.478 --> 00:02:26.980
I'm in the midst
of mild starvation.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.349
