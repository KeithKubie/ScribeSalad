00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.740
INTERVIEWER: Divorced
and left on her own

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:12.730
with three small children to
care for, Kelley Lewis decided

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:14.520
to turn her life
around and literally

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.219
rebuild it with her bare hands.

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.170
When you got divorced,
you had three small kids.

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.450
Can you tell me about what you
were going through mentally

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:32.479
and emotionally?

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:34.728
KELLEY LEWIS: Things were
not in my life going the way

00:00:34.728 --> 00:00:38.950
that I had hoped, career-wise,
relationship-wise, personally.

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:44.370
And that is when I dealt with
my most severe depression

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.080
and having medical
attention to address that.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.440
I'm 29.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.210
I know I have three children,
but I'm still just 29

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:53.710
and this doesn't
have to be the end.

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.750
And so that's when
I made the decision

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.110
to buy a piece of land.

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:00.160
And I just started
doing more research

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.591
and came across this
whole tiny house movement.

00:01:02.591 --> 00:01:05.090
And I just thought that was so
fascinating, because again, I

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:07.900
came back to what is
the most important to me

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.088
and finding that
meaning for myself.

00:01:11.088 --> 00:01:12.947
Come on in.

00:01:12.947 --> 00:01:14.030
INTERVIEWER: It's so cool.

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:15.020
It's so tiny.

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:16.479
KELLEY LEWIS: It is.

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:18.020
INTERVIEWER: How
big is actual space?

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.100
KELLEY LEWIS: It's
192 square feet.

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.450
12 feet wide by 16 feet long.

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.160
INTERVIEWER: And this is a
work in progress obviously.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.790
KELLEY LEWIS: Most definitely.

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:26.410
Most definitely.

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:28.493
INTERVIEWER: How long have
you been building this?

00:01:28.493 --> 00:01:32.350
KELLEY LEWIS: Third
summer, so two years.

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.000
INTERVIEWER: Aside
from the framing,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.540
the shell of the house, have
you done everything else

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:37.140
on your own?

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:37.890
KELLEY LEWIS: Yes.

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:38.690
Mm-hmm.

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:40.740
Everything from
insulation-- I did

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.240
have someone come
in and do electric

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.740
and show me how to do that.

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.330
But everything
else has been done

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.016
and I've had friends come help
me, and family help me, and--

00:01:49.016 --> 00:01:50.140
INTERVIEWER: And your kids?

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:51.806
KELLEY LEWIS: --And
my kids have helped.

00:01:53.705 --> 00:01:55.830
INTERVIEWER: What are some
of the bigger challenges

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:57.930
that you faced
building the house?

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.030
KELLEY LEWIS: The design
part was a challenge.

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.130
There was no computer.

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:02.250
There was nothing.

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.180
I literally used a ruler and
pencil with a good eraser

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.975
and designed it as I went.

00:02:12.734 --> 00:02:16.060
And I ended up hiring
someone to build the shell,

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.100
and then I've taken
it from there.

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.430
Watching YouTube videos on
how to install things or make

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.990
things, from a
composting toilet,

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:30.030
to a wood-burning stove
chimney, and things

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.730
that keep you off grid.

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.160
Lot of the things
that I've used,

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.490
such as the windows,
and doors, and the stove

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.600
have all been
recycled materials.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.051
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:47.477 --> 00:02:49.060
KELLEY LEWIS: I think
a lot of people,

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.640
especially in today's
society, always want more.

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.340
And something bigger and better
and I'm guilty of it too.

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.832
But it if it takes away from
you appreciating the smaller

00:03:00.832 --> 00:03:02.290
things and things
that you do have,

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.020
I think that's where
there's a disservice.

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:06.686
INTERVIEWER: What has
that meant for you

00:03:06.686 --> 00:03:09.410
to be able to build this
cabin with your children?

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:12.450
KELLEY LEWIS: Kids tend
to stereotypically learn

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.962
these types of things from
a dad or from a male figure

00:03:15.962 --> 00:03:17.670
but they're learning
that from their mom.

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.290
And they get to see
nature in the process.

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.831
And I think that's really cool.

00:03:23.831 --> 00:03:26.330
INTERVIEWER: What do you think
this house symbolizes to you?

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:30.810
KELLEY LEWIS: Well it started
as a symbol of a new beginning.

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.970
However, it's become
something more.

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:34.640
It's a rebuilding of a life.

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.920
Everything from
every screw or nail

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:41.369
that's been put into the cabin
has some sort of symbolic story

00:03:41.369 --> 00:03:42.160
and meaning for me.

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.710
Looking back, would
I change anything?

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:48.720
And I don't think I would.

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.570
I'm a stronger person for
it and by being a stronger

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:56.770
person myself will allow
me to be a stronger teacher

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:58.563
and create stronger children.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.560
INTERVIEWER: Be sure to
check out this next episode.

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.330
Two years of trash in
this tiny little jar.

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:11.110
SPEAKER: My values are
having a really low

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:12.070
environmental impact.

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:13.620
I have to live like I want that.

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.370
And so that's why I decided
to change my lifestyle.
