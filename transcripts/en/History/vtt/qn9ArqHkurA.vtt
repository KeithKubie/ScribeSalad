[music playing]

00:00:05.255 --> 00:00:10.510
September 19, 1961
has the first really

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:14.639
dramatic and well publicized
case of alien abduction.

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.852
Betty and Barnie were
driving through the White

00:00:18.852 --> 00:00:20.812
Mountain area of New Hampshire.

00:00:20.812 --> 00:00:22.564
RICHARD DOLAN: It
was late at night.

00:00:22.564 --> 00:00:25.442
Betty sees this unusual light
that seems to be maneuvering.

00:00:25.442 --> 00:00:28.945
This light stopped in midair
directly in front of us.

00:00:28.945 --> 00:00:30.822
The car motor stalled.

00:00:30.822 --> 00:00:33.867
And at that point, I realized
that they undoubtedly

00:00:33.867 --> 00:00:35.577
planned to take us on board.

00:00:35.577 --> 00:00:38.204
And then, the next thing
is that they're 35 miles down

00:00:38.204 --> 00:00:39.998
the road, and they
have no idea how they

00:00:39.998 --> 00:00:41.583
got that far down the road.

00:00:41.583 --> 00:00:43.960
It turns out they were
missing two hours.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.463
BARNEY HILL: My wife decided,
well, we should notify someone.

00:00:46.463 --> 00:00:49.841
And we thought of
notifying the military base

00:00:49.841 --> 00:00:51.551
located in this area.

00:00:51.551 --> 00:00:54.387
JACQUES VALLEE: A radar had
detected something unidentified

00:00:54.387 --> 00:00:57.766
and had reported it through
channels inside the Air Force.

00:00:57.766 --> 00:01:01.978
They had tracked an
identified craft at 2:14 AM,

00:01:01.978 --> 00:01:05.607
just about the time we
estimate that the UFO left.

00:01:05.607 --> 00:01:07.817
They developed a
series of nightmares.

00:01:07.817 --> 00:01:11.571
And, as a result of that,
ufologists told them,

00:01:11.571 --> 00:01:14.657
you should be regressed
hypnotically to try

00:01:14.657 --> 00:01:16.534
to see if you remember more.

00:01:16.534 --> 00:01:20.580
The doctor who did the
hypnosis was Dr. Simon.

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:21.790
He was an expert.

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.000
And he played the tapes for us.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.295
They are terrifying.

00:01:27.295 --> 00:01:28.046
BENJAMIN SIMON: All right.

00:01:33.468 --> 00:01:36.304
BARNEY HILL: Looks like a
big pancake with windows.

00:01:39.057 --> 00:01:41.392
JACQUES VALLEE: Something very
traumatic had happened to him.

00:01:41.392 --> 00:01:44.771
The Betty and Barney Hill
case interested my father a lot.

00:01:44.771 --> 00:01:48.316
And he did take part in
the hypnotic interview.

00:01:48.316 --> 00:01:49.943
RICHARD DOLAN: This
case did get a lot

00:01:49.943 --> 00:01:52.445
of behind the scenes
attention from some very

00:01:52.445 --> 00:01:54.280
interesting scientists.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.448
They wanted to
know what happened

00:01:55.448 --> 00:01:56.825
to Betty and Barney Hill.

00:01:56.825 --> 00:01:58.827
