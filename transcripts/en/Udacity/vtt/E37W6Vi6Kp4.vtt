00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.947
So what was unethical by today's standards however was when Milgram told

00:00:03.947 --> 00:00:07.652
participants that they had no choice but to continue in the research even when

00:00:07.652 --> 00:00:13.166
they didn't want to. Now to be fair to Milgram he was not breaking any rules

00:00:13.166 --> 00:00:16.204
because there were no rules at the time about how to treat participants and

00:00:16.204 --> 00:00:22.050
what they could and couldn't do. But in fact as a result of Milgram's study,

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.030
those rules came into existence as guidelines. Now, remember from lesson two

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:30.540
that the essence of these guidelines are first, that every participant sign a

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:35.360
consent form. Every participant be told in this consent form that they can

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.386
withdraw at any time, without penalty, and finally, that every participant be

00:00:39.386 --> 00:00:44.510
told afterwards what the study was about. And that is, debriefed.
