00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.660
 

00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.220
A lot of people,
including myself,

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:04.650
have found the
study of World War

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.520
I to be a little bit
confusing sometimes.

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.180
And I think the
reason is is the world

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:12.690
was very different leading up
to World War I than it is today.

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.970
And to some degree, the
modern world we live in

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:16.930
was shaped to a large
degree by Word War

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:18.471
I and then later World War II.

00:00:18.471 --> 00:00:20.970
And just to get a sense of what
our modern world looks like,

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.240
and especially what
modern Europe looks like,

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.460
this is a map of modern Europe.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.660
But the interesting
thing about this map

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:30.660
is instead of being the
traditional map that you

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.951
normally see where you just
see the country boundaries,

00:00:32.951 --> 00:00:35.471
the state boundaries, this
has the state boundaries right

00:00:35.471 --> 00:00:35.970
here.

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:37.870
And these little gray
lines, these show

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.080
where France ends and, say,
Switzerland or Germany or Italy

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.870
begins.

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.410
But overlain on
top of that we see

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:46.262
where the languages are spoken.

00:00:46.262 --> 00:00:47.970
So this is actually
much more focused on,

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:49.178
where do people speak French.

00:00:49.178 --> 00:00:50.770
Where do people speak German?

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.210
And the thing that you will
notice is, for the most part,

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.030
throughout most of Europe,
today's boundaries,

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.000
the modern boundaries
closely, closely match

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.210
up to where
languages are spoken.

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.330
There are a few
areas where there

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.650
is more of a disconnect
with Catalan and Spanish.

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.680
And actually, that is
leading to some issues.

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.270
But for the most part,
in modern Europe,

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.970
the country boundaries and
the linguistic boundaries

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.710
or the national boundaries
kind of match up.

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.600
If we rewind to the world of
entering into World War I,

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.250
things were very different.

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.930
Some of the boundaries
we recognize.

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.020
We recognize the United Kingdom.

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.580
Well, Ireland has
since been carved out.

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.820
But we recognize it
as not being that

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:34.994
different than it is today.

00:01:34.994 --> 00:01:36.160
Spain is not that different.

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:37.410
France is not that different.

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:39.380
Italy is not that different.

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.490
Germany is a good bit different.

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.210
In fact, if you take Germany,
the German Empire entering

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.760
into World War I,
or the early 1900s,

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.230
around 1914, between them
and the Russian Empire,

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:58.200
they essentially were swallowing
up a bunch of linguistic groups

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.970
right over here that now have
their own independent states.

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:03.880
The other thing that
you might notice

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.270
is this huge state called
Austria-Hungary, or often

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.509
called the
Austro-Hungarian Empire.

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.639
And people say, well, there's--
I'm familiar with some of these

00:02:13.639 --> 00:02:15.930
nations that have the word
Austria and Hungary in them,

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.360
but I'm not-- what is this
Austro-Hungarian Empire?

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.940
And what's interesting about
it is it really was an empire.

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.350
It was really trying
to cobble together

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:26.782
all of these folks that
spoke all different-- all

00:02:26.782 --> 00:02:28.240
the different types
of ethnicities.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:33.050
This is kind of a zoom-in of the
Austro-Hungarian Empire leading

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:34.500
into World War I.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.240
And the Austro-Hungarian Empire
is probably the most important

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.700
thing to understand
if we're trying

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.800
to get a sense of how World War
I started, because leading up

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.780
to World War I, in 1908,
the Austro-Hungarian

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.530
Empire formally annexed
Bosnia and Herzegovina.

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.670
And that's another confusing
thing for many of us,

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:54.390
that that's actually
one country.

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.390
It's called Bosnia
and Herzegovina,

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.090
or I guess for the
Austro-Hungarians that was now

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.700
one region that they annexed.

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.700
And what's
interesting about that

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.080
is if you look at
the linguistic map,

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.310
you see that this whole
region right over here

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.430
speaks a very similar--
essentially, they're

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.990
dialects of Serbian,
Croatian, Bosnian.

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:16.160
They're all very linguistically
and ethnically connected,

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.440
so this whole region
right over here

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.950
is linguistically and
ethnically connected.

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.080
And what we'll see is,
is that this desire

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:31.050
to connect people with similar
ethnic or linguistic roots--

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:34.510
linguistic backgrounds is what
led to a lot of what happened

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.490
in World War-- or at
least was the spark that

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:38.940
fueled, that people
sometimes say,

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.780
the powder keg of World War I.

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.980
The other thing that
was a very different

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.100
or the other country
or nation or empire

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:51.260
that we are not used to
today is the Ottoman Empire.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.880
So if we go today,
we see the country

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.770
of Turkey, which is on
the Anatolian Peninsula.

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:59.900
So this is Turkey
right over here.

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.460
This is modern-day Turkey.

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:05.070
But entering into
World War I in 1914,

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:07.870
Turkey was essentially part
of the remnants of the Ottoman

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:09.230
Empire.

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:11.920
So this right over here is what
the Ottoman Empire looked like.

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.970
This right over here is
roughly modern-day Turkey.

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.790
But the Ottoman Empire
consisted of modern-day Turkey

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:20.200
and much of the
modern Middle East.

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.530
So much of-- especially,
much of the Arab-- especially

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:28.080
the Arab world around
Syria, Iraq, Lebanon,

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.250
much of what where
modern-day Israel is,

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.160
some of Saudi Arabia.

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.010
And this was really the dying
state of the Ottoman Empire.

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:37.390
At its peak, it controlled
much of the Muslim world.

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:40.220
It controlled Northern Africa
as well as all the stuff

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:43.760
you see here and even
a little bit of Persia

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.310
and actually a good bit of
the Balkans, southeast Europe,

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:48.720
and even Greece at the
peak of its Ottoman Empire.

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.310
And now I'm talking about going
hundreds and hundreds of years

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:52.770
back into the past.

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:54.570
So when we enter
into World War II,

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:57.190
we don't have a world
where people are,

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:59.790
where states are defined
by linguistic boundaries

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:00.930
or by ethnic boundaries.

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.050
To a large degree,
we had these empires

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:06.670
that had existed as we
exited out of the 1800s.

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:08.750
And these empires were
not just in Europe,

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:12.650
like the Austro-Hungarian Empire
or not just in the Middle East,

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:14.420
like the Ottoman Empire.

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:20.090
Right over here is an empire map
at around that point in time.

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:23.040
And you see, probably the
most dominant feature here

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:24.530
is the British Empire.

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:25.970
That's in this pink color.

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:28.360
So British, that's
the United Kingdom.

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:31.230
Great Britain would just
be this right over here.

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:32.250
You throw in Ireland.

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:34.220
You get the United Kingdom.

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:37.320
Great Britain was in
control of the Indian,

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:41.290
the entire Indian subcontinent.  It was essentially

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:44.517
although nominally Egypt
was somewhat independent,

00:05:44.517 --> 00:05:46.600
Great Britain had a huge
amount of influence here.

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:52.570
Obviously places like Canada
and Australia and New Zealand

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:55.984
were under control of or a
part of the British Empire.

00:05:55.984 --> 00:05:57.400
What a lot of
people don't realize

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:00.670
is a significant amount
of Africa as well.

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:07.240
A significant amount of Africa
was also under British control.

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:10.330
And what we have running
up into World War

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:14.490
I is kind of a race
for empire, an arms

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:17.370
race between the major
powers of Europe.

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:21.060
In particular, you have Great
Britain, or the United Kingdom,

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:22.972
that obviously
had a vast empire.

00:06:22.972 --> 00:06:24.680
The sun never sets on
the British Empire.

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:26.440
And it wasn't ever
setting on this empire

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:27.810
that we just saw here.

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:31.450
And the German Empire was also
starting to flex its muscle

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:33.751
and starting to militarize.

00:06:33.751 --> 00:06:36.000
And the more that the German
saw that the British were

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.770
militarizing, the more
that the British--

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:41.546
the more that the Germans would
want to militarize and vice

00:06:41.546 --> 00:06:43.170
versa, and you just
had this arms race.

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:45.420
And they were all trying
to build their empires.

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:48.690
So the Germans, they
were present in Africa.

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:51.741
You have the French who were
present in much of Africa.

00:06:51.741 --> 00:06:53.740
And you have to remember
all of this in context.

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:57.140
Some of this empire building
was, frankly, just about ego

00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:59.340
and just about spreading
someone's influence,

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:01.190
spreading their power.

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:06.490
A lot of it was based on ethnic
beliefs about civilization.

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:08.680
I guess these were
rationalization to take control

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:10.420
of other people's resources.

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:12.640
And a lot of it was
we were in a world

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:15.700
where access to resources--
in particular, access

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:19.380
to raw materials and especially
oil-- could, to some degree,

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:24.580
define whether a power
was a power at all.

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:27.250
And so with that, I think
we have a pretty good basis

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:33.930
for the state of affairs as
we enter into World War I.

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:36.039
