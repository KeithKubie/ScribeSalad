1
00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:00.551
All right,

2
00:00:00.551 --> 00:00:05.080
there was a friend of mine that was older than me and he was always looking for

3
00:00:05.081 --> 00:00:10.081
the right girl and the right girl to settle down with and to marry and have kids

4
00:00:10.661 --> 00:00:13.780
and all that stuff.
And it never seemed to happen.

5
00:00:13.781 --> 00:00:17.260
And the reason it never seems to happen is cause he was always looking for

6
00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:22.000
perfection,
always looking for perfection.
And

7
00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.390
I told him that,
you know,
profession doesn't exist.

8
00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:33.010
And I also had another buddy of mine that was,

9
00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:38.080
we were like surfing and he was always looking for like the next good time.

10
00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:43.090
Always looking for,
he's looking for happiness,
right?

11
00:00:43.091 --> 00:00:47.380
And One time we're surfing and I go,
Bro,
you keep looking around for happiness.

12
00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.810
This is it.
This is it,
man.
We're surfing.
This is happiness right now.

13
00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:55.690
Do you

14
00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.820
ever feel like you're searching too much and looking for something

15
00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:10.580
<v 1>instead of enjoying what you have?
10 years ago I would've said yes.
Right now,</v>

16
00:01:10.581 --> 00:01:15.290
I feel like I've found,
I found,
uh,
a few things,

17
00:01:15.291 --> 00:01:17.510
meaning realizations and

18
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:24.100
I view my job as testing things on the fringe and reporting back psych half like

19
00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:33.410
ethnobotanist might be eaten by cannibals plus a little bit of athletic

20
00:01:33.411 --> 00:01:34.244
stupidity

21
00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.860
and really trying to find the things that the extreme so I can inform the mean

22
00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.000
and as an experimentalist or an experimenter,

23
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.060
I've viewed that as my responsibility,
my job.

24
00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.540
And I've also replaced a number of words in my life.
So we,

25
00:01:51.541 --> 00:01:54.860
we used happiness because it's just the easiest reference point for a lot of

26
00:01:54.861 --> 00:01:58.730
folks.
Uh,
I think that the

27
00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.020
better word,
his excitement.
So I,
I chase what excites me.

28
00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:09.970
Now that's a razor's edge you got to be careful with.
But when I say excite,

29
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
it means I wake up excited and I go to bed exhausted basically is what that

30
00:02:15.251 --> 00:02:17.810
means.
And,
uh,

31
00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.500
I've also realized that

32
00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.650
there are things to optimize and there are things to saver and I don't have a

33
00:02:26.651 --> 00:02:27.640
lot of trouble with that.

34
00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:32.230
Most people would think that I'm just like speed reading poetry and watching

35
00:02:32.231 --> 00:02:37.231
every movie on like 28 x forward with subtitles just to cram in as much Mr robot

36
00:02:38.681 --> 00:02:41.110
as I can or whatever.
And No,
I,

37
00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.310
I feel like I am increasingly better at the appreciation portion of the

38
00:02:48.671 --> 00:02:52.510
equation.
The achievement I've always been,
I wouldn't say hardwired for,

39
00:02:52.511 --> 00:02:53.740
but very well trained for.

40
00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.960
I'm good at putting goals in the sights and achieving those goals.

41
00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.910
But if you're constantly looking for the next thing,

42
00:03:01.911 --> 00:03:06.911
whether it's the next goal or its the next girl or it's the next high,

43
00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.330
then you are never going to be operating in the present tense.

44
00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.050
Was there something that you said 10 years ago,
if I would ask you this,

45
00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.090
you would have probably been on your heels a little bit.

46
00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.550
Is there something that happened that you said you don't want?
What did I just,

47
00:03:19.551 --> 00:03:23.240
you know,
did you get home from a trip one time and say what did I just do?

48
00:03:23.241 --> 00:03:26.060
Or what was there?
No,
I can tell you,
I can tell you that it was,
um,

49
00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:32.660
so this,
this is related to something that,
you know,
Robert Rodriguez,

50
00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.770
who's the director,
producer,
writer,
musician,
everything is fascinating guy,

51
00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:41.510
also huge.
I didn't realize how big it was.
So sin city good on the list,
right?

52
00:03:41.511 --> 00:03:45.620
He's,
he has a lot of hits.
And he said,

53
00:03:45.621 --> 00:03:48.910
I always find it funny,
and I'm paraphrasing here,
but uh,
he's,

54
00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:51.950
he's one of the longer chapters in the book.
He said,

55
00:03:51.951 --> 00:03:54.410
I always find it funny when filmmakers come up to be brand new filmmakers and

56
00:03:54.411 --> 00:03:57.620
they say nothing went the way it was supposed to go.

57
00:03:57.621 --> 00:04:01.130
Like this happened and that happened and shit broke and then we missed this shot

58
00:04:01.131 --> 00:04:04.340
and Dah,
Dah,
Dah.
And he said,
they don't realize that that's their job,

59
00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:06.980
that nothing is going to work.
Like if you're the director,

60
00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.890
your job is nothing's gonna work.
Uh,

61
00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:12.640
so at one point I was feeling,
uh,

62
00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.500
maybe existentially scattered.
I was like,
well,

63
00:04:15.501 --> 00:04:18.290
I'm trying all these different things and doing all these different experiments

64
00:04:18.291 --> 00:04:20.660
and what am I going to figure out my thing?

65
00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.690
And then at some point someone just said,
no,

66
00:04:23.691 --> 00:04:26.210
your thing is going Meta.

67
00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.760
Like your thing is doing these types of experiments.

68
00:04:28.761 --> 00:04:32.270
And what I realized is my,

69
00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:38.380
my one thing is learning things quickly and whether that is cooking or

70
00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:48.110
sniping,
I've taken some sniping courses,
that's a separate story.
Ah,
rally,

71
00:04:48.111 --> 00:04:50.240
car racing,
whatever,
right?

72
00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:55.250
Tango doesn't matter that the approach to deconstructing these things and learn

73
00:04:55.251 --> 00:04:57.890
them quickly compounds.
So if I get better at one,
I get better the next,

74
00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:02.450
it doesn't matter what the subject area is.
So that's my one thing.
Uh,

75
00:05:02.451 --> 00:05:04.490
and it just gave me great peace of mind.
A,

76
00:05:04.491 --> 00:05:08.120
you don't need one thing in a traditionally defined sense.

77
00:05:08.121 --> 00:05:11.570
Maybe your thing is as I have found,
you know,

78
00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:15.770
being a human Guinea pig and trying to train people to be better learners is my

79
00:05:15.771 --> 00:05:20.450
one thing.
Uh,
and that,
that made me feel more confident,
uh,

80
00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:24.650
in this sort of experimental approach.
I don't have 10 year plans and I used to,

81
00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:25.850
that used to bother me a lot.

82
00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:30.980
I am no longer remotely bothered by that.
Uh,

83
00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:34.640
because I have two week experiments and I have six month projects,

84
00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:39.650
and if I do my,
we actually talked about this and you've written about it,

85
00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:43.130
but rather than worrying about the,
the next 17 promotions,

86
00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:46.790
you just do what's in front of you.
In my case,
to say it's a book project,

87
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.050
if I do an exceptional job,
I knock it out of the park with this one thing.

88
00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:55.100
Opportunities will present themselves that I couldn't have conceived of six

89
00:05:55.101 --> 00:05:57.950
months ago.
And then it's just a matter of for the wave.

90
00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:03.720
That's awesome.
Yeah.
But I'm a lot better at appreciation than I was along,
uh,

91
00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:08.660
say 10 years ago,
uh,
because 10 years ago it didn't matter how,

92
00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:11.750
how will I did what I won,
what I accomplished,

93
00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:13.490
I was always obsessing on the next thing.

94
00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:17.510
I never took the time to actually enjoy it.
Good lesson.
