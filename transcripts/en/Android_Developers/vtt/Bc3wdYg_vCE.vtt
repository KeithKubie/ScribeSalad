00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.310
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:03.560
TROY SKINNER: Hello, everyone.

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:04.518
My name's Troy Skinner.

00:00:04.518 --> 00:00:06.980
Thanks for coming today.

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:09.160
I work in immersive,
where we created

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.220
self-determination theory,
which is the leading science

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:14.800
framework worldwide for
understanding motivation

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.030
and behavior.

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:18.610
Our founding group, which you
can tell by these numbers,

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:19.390
is very old.

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.170
It has over 350 published papers
and 100 plus years of combined

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:25.030
experience in applied work.

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:28.090
Our model is used or referenced
more than 30,000 times

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:28.870
per year.

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:30.700
Other academics use it.

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.729
There's research
across tons of domain.

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:34.480
So if you ever need
some bedtime reading,

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.397
there's lots of information
to find on the net

00:00:36.397 --> 00:00:37.540
after this talk.

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:39.790
And then where I focus
is on a unique practice

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.310
at the intersection of
software and motivation,

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:45.820
consulting on 50 plus
app projects a year.

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.070
Essentially, what we go
in is talk to developers,

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.000
talk about design,
throw out ways

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.390
to increase engagement by
using good behavioral science

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:54.430
practices.

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.880
Attention that you see a lot of
times in design conversations

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.680
is between business objectives.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.170
You're trying to focus on
bringing down churn, raising

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.120
subscriptions, very
laudable goals that

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.960
are important to our businesses,
and being customer first, which

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.810
obviously is an aspiration
if you care about who

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.330
uses your applications.

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.430
And this is very
natural tension.

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:18.530
But we found in our work
that it doesn't have to be.

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.190
Exciting news coming out
of our decades of research

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:25.330
is that, when you really
focus on satisfying consumers'

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.120
fundamental basic
psychological needs,

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.850
it increases their value
for the application.

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.057
And that increased value shows
up in all the outcome metrics

00:01:34.057 --> 00:01:35.390
are important to our businesses.

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:36.645
You see reduced churn.

00:01:36.645 --> 00:01:37.770
You see greater engagement.

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.802
You see greater monetization.

00:01:40.802 --> 00:01:42.260
Kind of where we
fit in the picture

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.730
is obviously we've gotten very
good as an industry at building

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:46.670
applications.

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.460
Lots of them are in the world.

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.950
We've gotten very good at
collecting behavioral data.

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.170
So we know if there's
good outcomes in our apps

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:54.700
or bad outcomes in our apps.

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.350
But where there's
kind of a black box

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.030
is in the middle about why
people do what they do.

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.630
So what we do at
Immersive is we really

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.020
focus on understanding why
people do the things they

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.750
do with in applications,
not only understanding it,

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.699
but measuring it
with really concrete,

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:12.670
discrete, granular metrics.

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.010
And then helping
use that information

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.460
to make better design decisions
about how to improve apps.

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.870
Self-determination
theory is, again,

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.770
focused on fundamental
human psychology.

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.440
So kind of the underpinning
to that is that every human--

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:28.930
all of us have
one in this room--

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.780
has three basic fundamental
psychological needs, which I'll

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.800
get into in more detail later.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.790
But we also look at things
like intrinsic versus extrinsic

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.120
motivation, goals and motives,
which are essential to long

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.490
term engagement,
mindfulness, vitality. .

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:45.040
It's a robust comprehensive
model motivation.

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.220
So it has a lot of different
nooks and crannies,

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.990
not all of which
we'll get into today.

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:52.870
Also, because it's about
fundamental human motivation,

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.330
it travels to a lot
of different contexts.

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.760
I do a lot of work in
entertainment software.

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.820
We work with world
class athletic programs

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.350
to avoid athlete burnout.

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.000
We work in education.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.470
We work in retirement.

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.190
Because it's about humans,
it's not trapped in any domain.

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:10.900
So it works across
all applications

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.820
because, if humans use it,
then motivation applies.

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.940
So now let's actually
get to the topic at hand.

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.620
Something that you
see a lot when people

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.940
talk about motivation
is that more is better,

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:29.320
that we want to essentially
get people to act by jamming

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:30.460
them full of motivation.

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:32.470
You've kind of seen
this humorous picture,

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:35.590
that if you have an exercise
app and your plan is

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.540
to have everyone
chased by a t-rex,

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.688
you'd certainly get
lots of running.

00:03:39.688 --> 00:03:41.980
But that probably wouldn't
lead to long term engagement

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:43.900
once the terror subsided.

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.550
The right way to
think about motivation

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:46.647
is not that you want more.

00:03:46.647 --> 00:03:48.730
It's about what the quality
of that motivation is.

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:51.160
So quality of motivation is
more important than quantity

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.980
of motivation, which kind
of brings us to a continuum

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.500
that I'll lay out
here for you guys.

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.840
Essentially, if you look at--

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.350
we can measure these things.

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:04.330
If you look at what people
are experiencing in your app,

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:07.240
there's basically low
motivation that ranges from,

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.540
they don't care, through,
feeling external pressure

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:11.950
to engage in the app.

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.200
Internal pressure, which
means I feel like I should do

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.089
and I feel guilt
or shame to do it.

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:18.279
Or personal value,
which means I have

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:19.779
a good reason, a
strong rationale,

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:20.950
for engaging the app.

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:23.950
To intrinsic value, which
is like, I just love running

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:25.640
or I just love using this app.

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.882
These are all different
categories of motivation.

00:04:27.882 --> 00:04:29.590
And they lead to very
different outcomes.

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:32.650
On the kind of bottom, you see
that low quality motivation

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:36.220
leads to less engagement, lower
productivity, less learning,

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:37.750
everything that we care about.

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:41.140
And in contrast, high motivation
leads to great outcomes.

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:43.220
So why is this useful?

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:49.480
Well, what we do is we measure
individual users, the quality

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:50.740
of their motivation.

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.350
And it allows us to
basically customize

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:57.550
our content to meet consumers
where they are motivationally.

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:59.602
So if someone has low
quality motivation,

00:04:59.602 --> 00:05:02.060
they don't really have a good
rationale for using your app,

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:03.477
then some of your
strategies might

00:05:03.477 --> 00:05:05.680
be to essentially
communicate to them where

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.452
they might find more personal
value in the application.

00:05:08.452 --> 00:05:09.910
If, in contrast,
someone is already

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:11.200
in love with the
application, you

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:12.670
don't need to convince
them to use it.

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:14.350
Instead, you continue
to empower what's

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:16.540
driving that intrinsic
value, showing them increased

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:20.230
opportunities, essentially,
and also avoiding

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:23.170
undermining that
motivation by being very

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:24.570
mechanistic in your design.

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:27.850
And I'll kind of explain
what that means more.

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:31.120
So now let's get
into the theory.

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:34.681
There are three basic
psychological needs.

00:05:34.681 --> 00:05:36.220
Needs is the
important word here.

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:39.160
They're not want in the
same way that hunger

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:40.660
is a physiological need.

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:42.840
So somewhere in the room
might say, sorry, Troy.

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.020
I don't believe in hunger.

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:45.103
I'm not a hunger guy.

00:05:45.103 --> 00:05:47.020
It doesn't matter if you
believe in it or not.

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:48.940
If you don't eat,
you'll starve to death.

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:50.890
Same thing with
psychological needs.

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:52.990
If these aren't fulfilled,
then you essentially

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:54.700
starve psychologically.

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:57.633
It works across cultures,
across genders, across ages.

00:05:57.633 --> 00:05:59.800
It fundamentally works for
everybody in the same way

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.250
that hunger does.

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:03.310
So what are these needs?

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:05.300
The first one's autonomy.

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:09.070
This is our need to feel like
we're the author of our life,

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:09.880
of our experience.

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:11.770
We're the one
driving the action.

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:14.620
The opposite of
autonomy is feeling

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:20.313
controlled or manipulated by
someone or an application.

00:06:20.313 --> 00:06:22.480
What you want to think about
during development when

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:24.580
trying to design for
increased autonomy is,

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:27.460
first, focus on
features that help users

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:30.860
build a personal narrative of
value for your application.

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:32.860
Essentially, the way to
think about it is you're

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:35.860
always trying to get people
to form long term goals,

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:40.300
not take actions based upon
very short term motivations.

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:43.540
The underpinning of
long term goal formation

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:45.140
is, why am I doing this?

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:46.163
What's my rationale?

00:06:46.163 --> 00:06:47.080
How will this help me?

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:48.310
How will this aid me?

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:51.190
So that communication has
to be enormously clear.

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:52.900
The opposite of
that is essentially

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:54.910
a carrots and sticks
approach, which

00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:56.560
is something you want to avoid.

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:59.320
This is things like rewards,
badges, time pressure,

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:01.750
those kinds of things to
get people to take actions.

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:04.150
It's not that rewards
can't be an important part

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:05.170
of motivation.

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:07.120
But they have to be
subordinate to people

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:08.440
having a personal narrative.

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:10.420
If there's something
they want to accomplish

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:12.300
and they take meaningful
steps towards that

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:14.520
and you reward them,
that's awesome.

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:16.270
If they don't have
that personal narrative

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:18.340
and essentially you're
trying to generate actions

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:20.410
all through carrots
and sticks, that's

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:23.650
going to lead to short term
improvement in behavior

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:25.760
but mid-term and
long-term problems.

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:28.600
And so it's important which
foundation you're building on.

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:30.337
The last thing is,
when possible, you

00:07:30.337 --> 00:07:32.170
want to provide meaningful
choices about how

00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:35.470
to interact with the app
like what value they get out

00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:37.990
of things because, essentially,
if people get choices,

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:40.600
then obviously it's easier for
them to endorse the path around

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:44.600
because they're helping to
design with their experiences.

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:46.900
The second need is our
need for relatedness.

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:49.600
This is our need to meaningfully
connect with other people,

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:53.440
to feel like they matter
to us, we matter to them.

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:55.190
Things to think about
during development--

00:07:55.190 --> 00:07:58.600
there's lots of mistakes that
happen in kind of social realm

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:00.760
around relatedness
is that it's not

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:02.990
about-- it's kind of like
the more is not better.

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:04.630
It's not about how
many connections

00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:06.250
you have on LinkedIn.

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:08.200
It's about the quality
of the relationships

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:10.730
that you have with people
within the application.

00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:13.090
So what you want to catalyze
is meaningful support.

00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:16.540
Where you see real improvement
in metrics and behavior

00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:18.715
is when people feel like
they matter to one another.

00:08:18.715 --> 00:08:20.590
So it's how do you build
those relationships,

00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:23.170
allow people to meaningfully
support one another,

00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:25.780
do things like collaborate
together on a shared project,

00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:28.180
have shared goals, coordinate.

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:29.920
Mentorship relationships
are a big deal.

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:31.660
If someone's expert
in a topic, can they

00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:33.220
help someone that's less expert?

00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:34.809
That's meaningful
to both parties.

00:08:34.809 --> 00:08:36.309
Those are the kinds
of relationships

00:08:36.309 --> 00:08:37.605
you're trying to bring about.

00:08:37.605 --> 00:08:39.730
Another thing that's very
common in app development

00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:42.500
is you see that people will
take an action in the app.

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:44.800
And it will get shared out
to their social network.

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:46.880
It's not always the best policy.

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:49.660
Once we worked on a
exercise and weight loss

00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:51.928
app that had the brilliant
idea that every time you

00:08:51.928 --> 00:08:53.470
gained weight to
tell everyone you've

00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:56.830
ever met that you just ate
a lot of food in Berlin.

00:08:56.830 --> 00:08:58.690
Not really the
best communication

00:08:58.690 --> 00:09:00.370
for your social identity.

00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:02.290
There's kind of this
automatic assumption

00:09:02.290 --> 00:09:03.808
that any sharing is good.

00:09:03.808 --> 00:09:05.350
But you always have
to think about it

00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:06.640
from the sharer's perspective.

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:08.170
Everything you say is
not necessarily something

00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:10.390
they want out there, which
brings us to the last thing--

00:09:10.390 --> 00:09:11.890
What people are
fundamentally trying

00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:15.317
to do in most applications
is create a social identity

00:09:15.317 --> 00:09:16.900
that basically
celebrates what they're

00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:19.030
good at, what makes
them different,

00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:21.190
essentially what's
distinct about them.

00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:23.110
Those are the messages
they want delivered.

00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:25.360
I don't want people to know
that I gained five pounds.

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:28.267
I want people to know that I got
to give a talk at Google Play.

00:09:28.267 --> 00:09:29.350
These are exciting things.

00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:31.840
So you really want to identify
what narrative people are

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:35.560
trying to write that has social
impact and kind of communicate

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:36.940
that for them.

00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:39.460
The last need, which is often
the easiest to understand,

00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:41.180
is our need for competence.

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:42.920
This is our desire
to be effective,

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:45.110
to be masterful, to grow.

00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:47.110
It tends to be very
intuitive to everyone

00:09:47.110 --> 00:09:49.270
that works in development
because, obviously,

00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:52.010
if your app is not accessible,
people can't use it,

00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:53.873
then obviously they
fail at high rates.

00:09:53.873 --> 00:09:55.540
So during development,
one of the things

00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:57.415
that we see people have
the most trouble with

00:09:57.415 --> 00:10:00.550
is when giving feedback
to users as it's

00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:04.010
important to be informational
rather than judgmental.

00:10:04.010 --> 00:10:06.640
So let's say that I am
picking up an exercise app.

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:08.140
And I instantly
don't know how to do

00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:10.120
a push up, which is likely.

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:13.000
Then, if you essentially
flash a big red light and say,

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.130
you have failed a
push up, that makes

00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:17.410
me feel incompetent
and not really want

00:10:17.410 --> 00:10:18.790
to stick with the exercise.

00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:21.040
In contrast, if I get
informational feedback

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:23.560
about how to do it
better, then I grow.

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:25.790
Then you're on the right
side of motivation.

00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:28.210
So a lot of times we
do things accidentally.

00:10:28.210 --> 00:10:30.910
We're trying to be clear
in telling people what's

00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:32.540
happening in the application.

00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:34.540
But accidentally,
we essentially judge

00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:36.140
their lack of effectiveness.

00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:37.870
And that basically
undermines motivation.

00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:40.990
So if it's informative
and they grow, good news.

00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:42.700
Judgemental, it's bad news.

00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:45.160
The next thing is that you
want to provide scaffolding

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:47.680
for successful growth
throughout the lifetime

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:48.677
of your application.

00:10:48.677 --> 00:10:51.010
So what we're going to talk
about more is that, when you

00:10:51.010 --> 00:10:53.290
have a huge consumer
base, people

00:10:53.290 --> 00:10:55.930
come in with different
degrees of expertise.

00:10:55.930 --> 00:10:57.530
And then as they
engage in your app,

00:10:57.530 --> 00:10:59.650
obviously, they're building
experience over time

00:10:59.650 --> 00:11:01.430
and becoming more
and more competent.

00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:03.490
So if you know that,
fundamentally, people

00:11:03.490 --> 00:11:06.285
need to grow or they're
going to quit an experience,

00:11:06.285 --> 00:11:07.660
then you have to
realize that you

00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:09.880
need to meet each
person where they are,

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:12.310
both from an
expertise standpoint

00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:14.620
and from an
experience standpoint,

00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:17.210
at the point that they
really need information.

00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:19.690
So you have to be really
contextual about understanding

00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:22.990
what's important to people
progressing and kind of given

00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:24.890
that information
when they need it.

00:11:24.890 --> 00:11:26.530
The last thing is
is because growth

00:11:26.530 --> 00:11:29.920
is so instrumental to
people having investment

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:33.590
in an application, part of
your communication strategy,

00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:36.130
the way in which you want
to talk about your app,

00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:38.800
both in app and time when
just talking to people,

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:40.990
is you want to kind
of foreshadow for them

00:11:40.990 --> 00:11:42.970
paths for growth
and how they can

00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:45.580
continue to develop the
longer they stay with the app.

00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:48.580
That's essentially where people
get a lot of value from things.

00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:50.710
So that's essentially a
key part of your messaging

00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:53.480
and communication.

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:57.160
So fulfillment of these needs
is essential in applications

00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:58.640
because they're
essential in life.

00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:01.810
This is not a model that's
talking about app development.

00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:04.630
It's a model that's talking
about what leads to fulfilling

00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:07.790
enriched satisfied consumers.

00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:10.630
So when your application
leverages these truths

00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:13.300
about motivation, then
you get lots of benefits

00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:15.910
to all the things that you
care about as a business

00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:19.460
long term engagement,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:21.530
So that's the general framework.

00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:23.470
A lot of times it's
easier to understand this

00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:26.190
when we go from a general
conversation to specific.

00:12:26.190 --> 00:12:28.570
So I'm going to talk
about some of the apps

00:12:28.570 --> 00:12:31.030
that we've worked with
recently and kind of put

00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:34.120
a little more meat
on these bones.

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:37.590
So an important topic
that's a huge issue

00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:41.220
for behavioral
scientists is retirement.

00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:44.850
I don't know-- it's
basically everyone

00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:47.880
understands how important
it is to lifelong happiness

00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:49.350
to prepare for retirement.

00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:52.800
But in the states,
only 4 out of 10 people

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:54.270
are actually saving
enough money.

00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:57.960
So 60% of the population
is not prepared.

00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:00.150
So a huge behavioral
science problem

00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:01.860
because it's something
that you have

00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:05.640
to do for the benefit of
people and for the country,

00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:07.350
but no one really
wants to engage in it.

00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:08.850
Why don't they want
to engage in it?

00:13:08.850 --> 00:13:12.060
Well, the first thing is that,
unlike games and entertainment

00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:14.760
apps, saving money is
not inherently fun.

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:16.693
Very few people
on a Friday night,

00:13:16.693 --> 00:13:19.110
when they're reviewing all the
options of enjoyable things

00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:22.510
they can do, think, now's the
time for retirement planning.

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:24.983
So when you work as a behavioral
scientist on this problem,

00:13:24.983 --> 00:13:26.400
the first thing
is that anyone you

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:29.370
talk to doesn't want to
talk about the topic, which

00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:31.832
obviously is a challenge.

00:13:31.832 --> 00:13:33.540
When we start looking
at retirement apps,

00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:35.100
we ran into another problem.

00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:36.960
All retirement app
start with what

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:41.108
we would basically characterize
as terrifying math questions.

00:13:41.108 --> 00:13:42.900
So they basically ask
you these two things.

00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:46.055
They first say, when
do you plan to retire?

00:13:46.055 --> 00:13:48.180
And the second thing they
say is, how long will you

00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:49.620
stay in retirement?

00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:51.990
When you look at that closely,
what it really basically

00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:55.290
boils down to is, when
are you planning to die?

00:13:55.290 --> 00:13:57.390
So if you wanted to
demotivate people,

00:13:57.390 --> 00:14:00.033
that's essentially the
perfect construction

00:14:00.033 --> 00:14:01.950
because not only do
people not know the answer

00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:06.600
to those questions but it makes
them feel an existential crisis

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:09.510
that they don't know the answer
and that death is impending.

00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:12.380
So retirement
apps, if their goal

00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:15.000
is to terrify their
customers, they're

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.170
really on top of things.

00:14:16.170 --> 00:14:19.230
And horribly, that is their
goal because, essentially,

00:14:19.230 --> 00:14:21.240
their model for how
to increase retirement

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:23.520
is to scare people,
to essentially make

00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:25.710
them feel that, if
they don't do this,

00:14:25.710 --> 00:14:27.750
then horrible things
will happen to them.

00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:29.730
If you remember what
we talked about earlier

00:14:29.730 --> 00:14:31.410
about motivational
quality, that's

00:14:31.410 --> 00:14:33.900
what we call external pressure,
where you're basically

00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:36.293
trying to get actions
by scaring people.

00:14:36.293 --> 00:14:37.710
Instead what we
want to do is make

00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:40.040
people realize what
the benefit for them

00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:41.410
of preparing for retirement is.

00:14:41.410 --> 00:14:44.010
So we had a different view
than the traditional retirement

00:14:44.010 --> 00:14:45.820
industry.

00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:47.160
So how did we approach this?

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:48.840
First, we wanted
to flip the script

00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:51.330
and basically talk to
the people using the app

00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:53.040
and say it's not about math.

00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:55.590
It's about creating a
foundation for living

00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:57.210
the life that you love.

00:14:57.210 --> 00:14:58.793
One of the big
disconnects that people

00:14:58.793 --> 00:15:00.668
have when they think
about retirement is they

00:15:00.668 --> 00:15:02.220
don't realize that
the person they're

00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:05.100
going to be in 10, 20,
30 years when they retire

00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:07.500
is the same person they are now.

00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:10.380
So where we wanted to start
the conversation is basically,

00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:12.510
what do you love in life?

00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:15.100
If you had more
time, more money,

00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:17.470
how would you spend
that time and money?

00:15:17.470 --> 00:15:18.850
What are your passions?

00:15:18.850 --> 00:15:20.250
What do you care about?

00:15:20.250 --> 00:15:23.340
This is diametrically opposed
to, when do you plan to die?

00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:26.340
It's essentially saying,
why do you want to live?

00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:27.820
What do you care about?

00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:31.410
So that's where we started
the application script.

00:15:31.410 --> 00:15:34.140
The second thing is, once
we got people really fixed

00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:36.660
on that point, we want to
make them more effective

00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:38.160
at answering the
questions we needed

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:40.560
them to answer to figure
out what the right plan was

00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:41.250
for them.

00:15:41.250 --> 00:15:43.190
So we made the
language less jargon-y.

00:15:43.190 --> 00:15:44.820
We made it more colloquial.

00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:46.278
Tied the questions
back to the plan

00:15:46.278 --> 00:15:48.862
that they had already started
to make when they discussed what

00:15:48.862 --> 00:15:50.310
they cared about their lives.

00:15:50.310 --> 00:15:53.220
And it put things in a much
more comfortable way for them

00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:55.682
to kind of intelligently
answer those questions.

00:15:55.682 --> 00:15:58.140
One of the things that you find
when you take this approach

00:15:58.140 --> 00:16:01.830
is that people feel much
more support and caring

00:16:01.830 --> 00:16:03.750
from the application
in the company

00:16:03.750 --> 00:16:05.980
because it's not trying
to terrify them anymore.

00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:07.928
It's basically trying
to support them and help

00:16:07.928 --> 00:16:08.970
them plan for retirement.

00:16:08.970 --> 00:16:12.190
So relatedness scores
shot up immediately.

00:16:12.190 --> 00:16:14.340
When we worked with our
client, they came to us.

00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:17.850
So they obviously felt some
appeal for this approach.

00:16:17.850 --> 00:16:20.070
But then we started to say,
this is what our plan is,

00:16:20.070 --> 00:16:22.860
they were kind of nervous
because their experience,

00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:24.990
over dozens of years of
working in this field,

00:16:24.990 --> 00:16:28.410
was the longer you made the
application process, the more

00:16:28.410 --> 00:16:30.042
people that quit along the way.

00:16:30.042 --> 00:16:31.500
And essentially,
asking people what

00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:34.530
they wanted to do with their
lives lengthened the process.

00:16:34.530 --> 00:16:36.540
And so even though
they believed in it,

00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:38.250
they were nervous
about its success.

00:16:38.250 --> 00:16:40.920
Happily, what we
saw when we finished

00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:43.140
the application is that
retirement savings were

00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:47.640
increased by more than 400%
versus the previous design.

00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:50.220
And as I mentioned
previously, customer loyalty

00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:52.590
and appreciation soared
because now people

00:16:52.590 --> 00:16:55.020
felt supported in the
process of figuring out

00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:58.490
retirement rather than scared.

00:16:58.490 --> 00:17:00.230
Another area that
we worked in a lot

00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:03.050
is health and fitness,
health and fitness

00:17:03.050 --> 00:17:04.369
also very challenging.

00:17:04.369 --> 00:17:06.290
Maybe not as hard as
retirement, which is

00:17:06.290 --> 00:17:09.763
the worst, but also very hard.

00:17:09.763 --> 00:17:11.930
One of the things we talked
about earlier that where

00:17:11.930 --> 00:17:14.660
we sit in the relationship
with developers

00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:17.240
is there are a lot of
behaviors that you see.

00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:20.240
And the real question is, why
is someone doing that thing?

00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:22.349
Exercise is massive for this.

00:17:22.349 --> 00:17:24.710
If you go to a gym,
you see 100 people.

00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:26.180
They're all working out.

00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:28.490
So behaviorally, they
all look like they're

00:17:28.490 --> 00:17:30.110
doing the activity
that you want,

00:17:30.110 --> 00:17:32.690
that they're all
successfully exercising.

00:17:32.690 --> 00:17:34.280
But what's under
the surface is very

00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:37.020
important to the prediction
model for how long

00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:39.270
they continue to exercise.

00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:41.840
So the question is, what
can we do with our framework

00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:44.960
to help find where each
user is and help them

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:47.402
along their journey
to a healthier life?

00:17:47.402 --> 00:17:48.860
So the first thing
we want to do is

00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:50.277
you want to measure
and understand

00:17:50.277 --> 00:17:52.100
where the customer
is at motivationally.

00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:54.770
And I'm going to click through
a number of statements, which

00:17:54.770 --> 00:17:58.200
basically characterize different
kinds of motivational quality.

00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:00.020
So someone might be
exercising because they

00:18:00.020 --> 00:18:01.480
were told they need
to make changes

00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:02.480
or they're going to die.

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:04.130
This is close to
our retirement thing

00:18:04.130 --> 00:18:05.960
again, where, if
you don't do this,

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:07.700
horrible things will happen.

00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:11.060
The next one is, I know I
should focus on my health.

00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:12.883
I'll feel guilty if I don't.

00:18:12.883 --> 00:18:14.300
I know it's the
right thing to do.

00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:17.570
Not necessarily that I want
to do it but I should do it.

00:18:17.570 --> 00:18:19.910
The next statement is, I
want to take care of myself

00:18:19.910 --> 00:18:23.270
because I know it will
benefit my quality of life.

00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:24.650
And the last one
is, I just enjoy

00:18:24.650 --> 00:18:26.450
having a healthy lifestyle.

00:18:26.450 --> 00:18:29.720
Basically, each of these
are a different step

00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:32.750
along the way to higher
motivational quality.

00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:36.050
And what we know, by doing these
studies 100 different times,

00:18:36.050 --> 00:18:38.930
is that where you
are in this journey

00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:41.750
is predictive of how long you're
going to continue to exercise.

00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:44.060
Essentially, the first
statements that I read

00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:45.320
have very bad results.

00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:48.350
That's where you hear people
like-- the stat's like only 5%

00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:50.870
of people that start an exercise
program continue with it

00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:52.340
for more than eight weeks.

00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:54.363
On the far right, you
see great outcomes.

00:18:54.363 --> 00:18:56.030
These are the people
that run every day,

00:18:56.030 --> 00:18:57.500
have happy healthy lives.

00:18:57.500 --> 00:19:00.290
And so the question is, what
do you do about this problem

00:19:00.290 --> 00:19:02.540
because tons of the people
that come into applications

00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:05.810
or come into gyms sit in the
unhealthy space motivational.

00:19:05.810 --> 00:19:07.610
And so as behavioral
scientists, they

00:19:07.610 --> 00:19:09.140
care about people's well-being.

00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:10.230
Can we do anything?

00:19:10.230 --> 00:19:12.740
So first, we understand
where they're at.

00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:14.300
The next thing we
do is, if we know

00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:16.430
they're in a place
motivationally that's

00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:19.807
not predictive of them
continuing on with exercise,

00:19:19.807 --> 00:19:21.890
then we know that we have
to help them internalize

00:19:21.890 --> 00:19:24.290
greater value for the activity.

00:19:24.290 --> 00:19:26.690
That means giving them
the right content that

00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:30.110
supports their competence,
communicates to them

00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:33.080
the long term value, essentially
tries to make an argument

00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:35.842
experiencially about what
the benefits of exercise

00:19:35.842 --> 00:19:38.300
are going to be because we know
we have to essentially move

00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:41.210
them within the application to
a different place motivationally

00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:44.120
or they're not going
to stay around.

00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:45.220
I mentioned this earlier.

00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:48.170
I actually gave you a push
up example, so it's perfect.

00:19:48.170 --> 00:19:50.000
Finally, you want to
avoid signals that

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.850
evoke evaluation or pressure.

00:19:52.850 --> 00:19:54.920
It like a pretty
fit room in here.

00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:57.350
But some of you may
have experienced

00:19:57.350 --> 00:19:59.180
not exercising for
two or three years

00:19:59.180 --> 00:20:00.860
and trying to get back into it.

00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:02.780
What that feels like
is you oftentimes

00:20:02.780 --> 00:20:05.540
feel like a novice coming
back to an experience

00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:08.280
that you don't
feel expert around.

00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:11.150
If you're in a gym, you're in
an exercise app, oftentimes,

00:20:11.150 --> 00:20:14.020
the assumption is you already
know everything about exercise.

00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:15.020
You know the right form.

00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:16.070
You know how many to do.

00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:17.840
You know everything about it.

00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:21.393
Obviously, that makes people
feel like they lack competence.

00:20:21.393 --> 00:20:23.060
So then, when they
take their first baby

00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:24.727
steps into doing
something and basically

00:20:24.727 --> 00:20:27.500
an application or a trainer
says wrong, wrong, wrong,

00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:29.870
that's not how you do
it, but obviously, that's

00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:31.580
a barrier for people
to continue on.

00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:34.400
So again, this is where
you don't want feedback

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:35.227
to be judgmental.

00:20:35.227 --> 00:20:36.560
You want it to be informational.

00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:39.053
And oftentimes,
judgmental feedback

00:20:39.053 --> 00:20:40.220
happens in very subtle ways.

00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:41.803
I kind of mentioned
this earlier where

00:20:41.803 --> 00:20:43.760
we'll do things that
have strong heuristic

00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:47.780
value like flash a red light
to say that your form's wrong.

00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:49.970
But essentially,
what someone's seeing

00:20:49.970 --> 00:20:52.820
that's in a fragile state
around their competence is,

00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:53.810
I'm doing this wrong.

00:20:53.810 --> 00:20:55.245
And I'm horrible at exercise.

00:20:55.245 --> 00:20:56.120
And what's the point?

00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:57.558
I should eat potato chips.

00:20:57.558 --> 00:20:59.600
Instead, what they need
at that point is support.

00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:02.300
And so really, what
this approach is about

00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:04.910
is recognizing where
people are motivational

00:21:04.910 --> 00:21:06.902
and being sensitive to
meet them at the place

00:21:06.902 --> 00:21:08.360
that they're at to
try to move them

00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:12.862
to a healthier place
around exercise.

00:21:12.862 --> 00:21:14.320
The last thing I
want to talk about

00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:16.900
is a workshop that
my partner Scott

00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:19.820
did with Calm, which,
some of you may know,

00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:22.387
is an excellent meditation app.

00:21:22.387 --> 00:21:24.970
And basically, this is a lot of
what our work looks like where

00:21:24.970 --> 00:21:26.350
we sat down with them.

00:21:26.350 --> 00:21:27.550
Understood their product.

00:21:27.550 --> 00:21:30.370
And kind of brainstormed
some future possibilities

00:21:30.370 --> 00:21:32.900
for the application.

00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:35.770
The first thing, there is a lot
of ideas that came out of that.

00:21:35.770 --> 00:21:38.990
Someone at Scott's workshop
said, my head's bursting.

00:21:38.990 --> 00:21:42.242
There's so many things that came
up with this model and place.

00:21:42.242 --> 00:21:44.200
But some of the things
that were most important

00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:46.870
was, one, let's try
to replace a one size

00:21:46.870 --> 00:21:49.540
fits all onboarding
approach with content

00:21:49.540 --> 00:21:51.850
that matches the specific
motivational profile

00:21:51.850 --> 00:21:54.000
of each customer.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:59.050
You can kind of see on
the mock on the right kind

00:21:59.050 --> 00:22:02.440
of some suggestions for a
way, a more tailored approach,

00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:04.270
might be more
appealing to people

00:22:04.270 --> 00:22:05.620
coming into an application.

00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:08.080
Instead of just
saying, let's meditate,

00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:10.590
would you like to meditate
to reduce anxiety,

00:22:10.590 --> 00:22:13.720
to improve your focus, to work
on sleep issues, et cetera,

00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:14.390
et cetera?

00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:16.015
You can see how that
would make someone

00:22:16.015 --> 00:22:18.880
feel more authorship, more
ownership, feel more effective,

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:20.500
be able to find the
content they want.

00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:23.083
It's essentially the thing that
we talked about earlier, which

00:22:23.083 --> 00:22:27.100
is tailoring things to people's
more specific growth interests.

00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:30.440
The next thing is we
measure motivational quality

00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:32.140
when we work with developers.

00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:34.540
And so, within the
realm of meditation,

00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:37.630
it made perfect sense to say,
the point we're trying to make

00:22:37.630 --> 00:22:40.420
is, if you meditate, you
see all these great outcomes

00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:43.480
to your physical health
and psychological health.

00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:45.160
So why don't we take
those measurements

00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:46.960
that we're doing for
development purposes

00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:49.020
and show them to the consumers?

00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:52.055
Show them that, once they put
in the work in their practice,

00:22:52.055 --> 00:22:54.430
that they're getting all these
obvious benefits that they

00:22:54.430 --> 00:22:55.388
care about their lives.

00:22:55.388 --> 00:22:58.330
That's a lot of the reason why
people come to meditation apps.

00:22:58.330 --> 00:23:01.360
So that was an exciting
idea that everyone kind of

00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:02.530
grabbed onto.

00:23:02.530 --> 00:23:05.110
And then lastly,
that same detail

00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:08.502
that we use to show people
that this is working also

00:23:08.502 --> 00:23:10.210
shows us where our
program is not working

00:23:10.210 --> 00:23:11.693
as well as we would like it to.

00:23:11.693 --> 00:23:14.110
So it might be that we have
these eight different domains.

00:23:14.110 --> 00:23:16.130
And three of them,
every one that

00:23:16.130 --> 00:23:18.700
essentially tries to reduce
anxiety gets perfect results.

00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:20.170
And we've crushed it.

00:23:20.170 --> 00:23:22.128
It might be that,
in three others,

00:23:22.128 --> 00:23:23.170
it works for some people.

00:23:23.170 --> 00:23:24.490
And it doesn't work
for other peoples.

00:23:24.490 --> 00:23:26.365
And it might be in the
last two that it's not

00:23:26.365 --> 00:23:27.220
working for anyone.

00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:31.730
This allows us, as developers,
to pinpoint where we most need

00:23:31.730 --> 00:23:32.987
to add design features.

00:23:32.987 --> 00:23:34.570
And then we can start
to triage, well,

00:23:34.570 --> 00:23:37.330
why aren't these two
sections working well?

00:23:37.330 --> 00:23:38.980
Is it that people
don't understand it?

00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:40.210
Are they ineffective?

00:23:40.210 --> 00:23:42.015
Do they not
understand the value?

00:23:42.015 --> 00:23:43.390
Are they not seeing
the benefits?

00:23:43.390 --> 00:23:44.832
Is there not good feedback?

00:23:44.832 --> 00:23:46.540
All the issues that
we brought up before.

00:23:46.540 --> 00:23:48.790
So essentially, the
point of these metrics

00:23:48.790 --> 00:23:51.820
is to give us more precision
about why people are doing what

00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:54.490
they're doing in applications.

00:23:54.490 --> 00:23:56.350
So just a few takeaways
that hopefully you

00:23:56.350 --> 00:23:58.240
got from today's talk.

00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:00.520
One is that you
can build loyalty

00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:02.590
by authentically
supporting your customers'

00:24:02.590 --> 00:24:05.470
basic psychological needs,
which are autonomy, relatedness,

00:24:05.470 --> 00:24:06.520
and competence.

00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:11.900
I've been in literally, over the
last 10, 15 years, 5,000 design

00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:12.820
discussions.

00:24:12.820 --> 00:24:16.500
And I understand how oftentimes
you're triaging a problem.

00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:18.070
And a lot of times
you want to find

00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:20.230
any solution that will work.

00:24:20.230 --> 00:24:23.260
Taking shortcuts
is the wrong term.

00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:26.650
But you oftentimes get really
myopic about how to solve

00:24:26.650 --> 00:24:29.590
a problem. , Really what our
recommendation is just take

00:24:29.590 --> 00:24:32.980
a step back and try to
understand the foundations

00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:35.650
of consumer behavior
and motivation and say,

00:24:35.650 --> 00:24:38.395
how do we solve this design
problem with that kind

00:24:38.395 --> 00:24:41.020
of greater perspective, because
that's essentially what's going

00:24:41.020 --> 00:24:44.320
to give you the best
long term results.

00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:46.420
Next thing is that
reframing the app experience

00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:49.420
in the context of these needs
deepens motivational quality

00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:51.215
and builds personal
value that lasts.

00:24:51.215 --> 00:24:52.840
Really, it's a
variation the same point

00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:54.670
that I made before,
that there is basically

00:24:54.670 --> 00:24:58.030
ways to design things that are
much better suited to setting

00:24:58.030 --> 00:24:59.548
up long term engagement.

00:24:59.548 --> 00:25:01.840
A lot of times, we make
choices as designers that might

00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:03.400
solve a problem temporarily.

00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:05.920
But this is really the
foundation that lasts.

00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:08.390
The third thing is collecting
motivational profiles,

00:25:08.390 --> 00:25:10.600
things like motivational
quality and how

00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:13.580
the three basic psychological
needs are being fulfilled

00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:17.500
empowers customization of
the user experience at scale.

00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:20.290
Oftentimes, what you'll find is
there are three or four or five

00:25:20.290 --> 00:25:24.562
profiles of consumers that you
can find in your application.

00:25:24.562 --> 00:25:26.770
And you can make intelligent
choices about which ones

00:25:26.770 --> 00:25:29.506
to serve first, how to serve
each one of them, that ends up

00:25:29.506 --> 00:25:32.560
getting you really good
benefits in consumer engagement

00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:34.090
very quickly.

00:25:34.090 --> 00:25:36.760
Fourth, remember the negative
effects of external controls

00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:41.120
on autonomy, even when
building rewards systems.

00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:46.060
A lot of app design has
ties back to game design.

00:25:46.060 --> 00:25:49.870
People realized very quickly
that reward systems, badges,

00:25:49.870 --> 00:25:51.820
experience points
levels, all these things

00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:54.485
are an important
part of game design.

00:25:54.485 --> 00:25:56.110
And there's a way in
which those things

00:25:56.110 --> 00:25:58.300
can be employed
effectively in applications

00:25:58.300 --> 00:26:01.240
that support people's
narrative about the experience.

00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:03.480
But a lot of times, when
those things get divorced

00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:06.880
and it's all badges, rewards,
levels, and no understanding

00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:09.720
of what's driving people's long
term engagement of the product,

00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:12.100
it essentially has
an undermining effect

00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:13.400
on motivation and engagement.

00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:16.060
So you don't want to build
your app's engagement

00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:17.400
on a foundation of sand.

00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:20.350
You really want to connect the
thing that's going to last.

00:26:20.350 --> 00:26:24.230
Lastly, as behavioral scientists
that care about autonomy,

00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:25.730
we want to be
autonomous supportive.

00:26:25.730 --> 00:26:30.160
We wouldn't want you to see
this framework as rules.

00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:34.120
It's supposed to be guidelines
to kind of inspire innovation,

00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:36.310
help you to think more
creatively about how

00:26:36.310 --> 00:26:39.170
your application can
improve its engagement.

00:26:39.170 --> 00:26:42.250
So that's hopefully the
spirit that has taken in.

00:26:42.250 --> 00:26:45.370
If you need any help figuring
out what questions to ask,

00:26:45.370 --> 00:26:47.230
how to collect
this kind of data,

00:26:47.230 --> 00:26:48.790
how to design more
motivationally,

00:26:48.790 --> 00:26:50.680

00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:51.520
Thank you very much.
