Anthony?

00:00:06.162 --> 00:00:07.174
&gt;&gt; Hey, Georgia.

00:00:07.174 --> 00:00:08.794
&gt;&gt; Are you okay?

00:00:08.794 --> 00:00:13.507
&gt;&gt; Honestly, I have been kind of
struggling to figure out how to

00:00:13.507 --> 00:00:16.560
write out the back end for my code.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.480
My friend Walter told me that
I should use Ruby for it, but

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.950
I don't know Ruby and the syntax is
weird, and I don't know what I'm doing.

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:25.910
And.
&gt;&gt; Okay, let's just take a step back and

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:27.850
realize that you've come a long way.

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:30.390
You're in your strain zone right now but
that's okay.

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.520
So just tell me a little bit
about what you're doing.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:39.240
&gt;&gt; I'm trying to build out a class for
a database so that I can store images.

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.420
&gt;&gt; So, you've learned about
classes in Python, right?

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:44.560
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.740
&gt;&gt; Okay, let's just put project
compass aside for a minute,

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:51.670
and look at an example of a class, okay?

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:56.680
So, here's a class in Python for a car
object, can you explain that to me?

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.600
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
So, it's got a couple of attributes.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.119
Year, make, and model, and
I see down here we have this new_car

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:09.730
that's a new_car object with some
of these attributes defined.

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:11.440
&gt;&gt; Okay, great.
So

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.590
let's look what this looks like in Ruby.

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.820
So, as you can see,
there are a couple of differences.

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.720
In Python, you would have to
declare self, but in Ruby,

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.760
you don't have to do that.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.089
Also, when you create a new
instance of a variable,

00:01:26.089 --> 00:01:30.188
you actually need the keyword.new,
but in Python you don't.

00:01:30.188 --> 00:01:33.580
But other than that,
the logic is pretty much the same.

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.570
&gt;&gt; Okay, I see how they're similar.

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.200
How can I learn more about
these syntax differences?

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.210
&gt;&gt; So you can check out the Ruby
documentation online or you can check

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.075
out online forums because there's a huge
community to help new programmers.

00:01:47.075 --> 00:01:48.645
In addition,
check out the Udacity forms,

00:01:48.645 --> 00:01:49.926
that will be really helpful to you.

00:01:49.926 --> 00:01:51.370
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:52.730
I'll give it another shot.

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:53.510
Thanks Georgia.

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:54.815
&gt;&gt; You can do it Anthony,
I believe in you.

00:01:54.815 --> 00:01:56.264
