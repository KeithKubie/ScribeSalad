00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:03.600
Eyes are incredible and complex creations.

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:09.380
To see, light is focused by the cornea, passes
through a clear lens and is encoded by the

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:11.950
retina, which sends electrical impulses to
the brain.

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:17.670
But if you have a cataract, proteins on the
lens start to cloud together, creating blurry

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.829
vision.

00:00:19.829 --> 00:00:24.699
For over 20 million people, this is how they
see the world.

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:27.529
Cataracts are the leading cause of blindness
globally.

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:30.640
“Blindness affects your life expectancy.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.739
You become a hangout, you become an appendage
for the family.

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:37.010
And then you become an economic burden.”

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:43.180
But thanks to a revolutionary surgical method,
sight can be restored in just under five minutes.

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:50.219
The small incision surgery is generally a
very cost effective, and simple manual technique

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:56.870
to remove cataract and still give the patient
comparable results.

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.739
For over 20 years, Dr. Sanduk Ruit pioneered
a surgical method and his team of doctors

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:04.820
have performed over 600,000 surgeries.

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:10.060
In just five minutes, surgeons make a tiny
incision in the eye, remove the cataract and

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:11.990
insert an artificial lens.

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:18.060
Dr. Ruit’s goal is to rid the world of treatable
blindness with this quick and affordable method,

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.710
and today he’s doing just that.

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.380
Tucked away in the mountains of Nepal, crowds
of prospective patients are waiting their

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:27.740
turn for an eye exam.

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.280
They’ve traveled long distances and across
challenging terrain to the Tilganga Institute

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:38.790
of Ophthalmology, a nonprofit clinical eye
facility founded by Dr. Ruit.

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:44.480
“Every time we see a bigger line we tend
to increase the stations inside, and there

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:49.680
are more doctors, more staff who are working
now.”

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.670
Born in Nepal, Dr. Ruit has dedicated his
life’s work to bringing cost-effective,

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.240
hospital grade care to the world’s poorest
regions.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.910
“It's a beautiful moment.

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:02.310
Every moment when the patches come off, when
you see the smile on the patient's face, it's

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.050
always very nice, it's this ticklish feeling.

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.640
It charges your battery and makes you work
harder.”

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:15.660
Dr. Ruit and his team have established mobile
surgery camps in North Korea, China, Bhutan,

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:21.800
and Ethiopia, training local medical professionals
and treating as many patients as possible.

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:29.920
“Tilganga has been a front-runner in delivering
this high quality surgery at places where

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.319
there are no health facilities.”

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:37.480
Dr. Ruit’s game changing surgical method
comes down to a small incision and an affordable

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.070
intraocular lens.

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:44.790
The lenses are manufactured in a state of
the art fabrication lab, and they cost just

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:45.790
$4 each.

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.480
These lenses typically cost $100 in the developed
world.

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:55.231
“These are highly special plastic materials
that you put and have no reaction in the eye

00:02:55.231 --> 00:02:56.231
at all.”

00:02:56.231 --> 00:03:03.090
The lab produces about 350,000 lenses annually
and sells them to over 60 countries.

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:08.590
“In West, most of the medical bills are
very expensive, and partly because the state

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.740
and the people can pay for it.

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:17.160
And here, we have to make it cost effective
because people can't pay for it.”

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:22.430
Inside the hospital, Dr. Ruit and his team
are preparing for the day’s surgeries.

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:28.891
“The whole idea of the small incision surgery
is to make the wound self-sealing, and the

00:03:28.891 --> 00:03:33.350
idea of making a wound self-sealing is to
have an external opening and an internal opening

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:34.830
at two different planes.

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:41.990
You go and make a tunnel and have internal
opening in another place, make an opening

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.990
into the cataract.

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:45.120
Once the cataract has come out, it's more
like a boiled egg.

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:51.000
The yellow of the egg is the nucleus, which
you take out now, and then you go in and remove

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.980
the rest of the white of the egg.

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:57.260
And you have the shell of the egg on the back,
which you have to intentionally keep intact.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.349
And on the shell of the egg, you put the intraocular
lens.

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:06.120
The intraocular lense will allow you to focus
and not, not leave you long-sighted.

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:18.750
There are many instances where it changes
the life of the person.

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:24.969
The things that we have done here in Nepal,
especially in Tilganga, which has caused some

00:04:24.969 --> 00:04:28.710
revolution in public health of ophthalmology.

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:34.099
Cataract surgeries, and of that, probably
15 million wouldn't have been able to get

00:04:34.099 --> 00:04:39.490
this surgery done if an organization like
us hadn't done this kind of homework.

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:43.733
So now they can get it done so the impact
you can see.

00:04:43.733 --> 00:04:47.979
They can have this kind of surgery, cost effectively,
the number of surgeries can go up.

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:51.009
So I think that, it has a great public health
impact.”
