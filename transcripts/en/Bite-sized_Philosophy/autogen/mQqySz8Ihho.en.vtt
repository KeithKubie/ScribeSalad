tremendous stress placed on sexual

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 align:start position:0%
liberation and so there's this idea that
 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.419 align:start position:0%
liberation and so there's this idea that
I<00:00:26.970><c> think</c><00:00:27.150><c> is</c><00:00:27.390><c> associated</c><00:00:28.080><c> in</c><00:00:28.199><c> large</c><00:00:29.189><c> part</c>
