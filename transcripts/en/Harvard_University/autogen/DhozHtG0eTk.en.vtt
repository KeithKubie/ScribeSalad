00:58:37.280 --> 00:58:37.290 align:start position:0%
out how do you you know be sane and

out how do you you know be sane and
balance<00:58:37.620><c> it</c><00:58:37.770><c> and</c><00:58:37.920><c> and</c><00:58:38.280><c> achieve</c><00:58:38.700><c> the</c><00:58:38.880><c> things</c>

00:58:38.900 --> 00:58:38.910 align:start position:0%
balance it and and achieve the things
 

00:58:38.910 --> 00:58:42.410 align:start position:0%
balance it and and achieve the things
that<00:58:39.660><c> you</c><00:58:39.810><c> can</c><00:58:40.110><c> achieve</c><00:58:40.260><c> and</c><00:58:40.710><c> that</c><00:58:41.460><c> comes</c><00:58:42.300><c> from</c>

00:58:42.410 --> 00:58:42.420 align:start position:0%
that you can achieve and that comes from
 

00:58:42.420 --> 00:58:44.540 align:start position:0%
that you can achieve and that comes from
a<00:58:42.810><c> different</c><00:58:43.050><c> kind</c><00:58:43.740><c> of</c><00:58:43.890><c> leadership</c><00:58:44.130><c> which</c><00:58:44.400><c> I'm</c>

a different kind of leadership which I'm
