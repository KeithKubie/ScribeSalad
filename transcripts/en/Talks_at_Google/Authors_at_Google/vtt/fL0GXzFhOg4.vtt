CHARLIE SAWYER:
I'm Charlie Sawyer.

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:13.010
I work here in the Cambridge
office on gTech, specifically,

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:14.800
Google Flight Search.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.020
And it's my great
pleasure-- have a seat, Ron.

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:20.310
RON LEVY: I wanted to say
thank you all for coming.

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.940
CHARLIE SAWYER: I
first became acquainted

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:27.940
with Ron in 1970, when I
was researching a book that

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:33.940
became a biography of
B.B. King after a 10- year

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.050
search and rejection
by 53 publishers.

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:40.470
And it was published
by Doubleday.

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.930
Now at that same time, Ron
was working on a book himself.

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.320
I don't know if he
was really fully aware

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.360
that he was working on a book.

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.600
And he was doing
research, we might say.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.400
And it took another, what, 30?

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.457
40 years of research--

00:00:56.457 --> 00:00:57.665
RON LEVY: But who's counting?

00:00:57.665 --> 00:01:01.810
CHARLIE SAWYER: --to
realize this book,

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:08.090
which is our topic today,
"Tales of a Road Dog."

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.150
And the way we've
decided to structure

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.830
this is I'm going to
start with the question

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:17.810
I think everybody
will have in mind.

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.170
Then Ron will give us a tour of
the content of the book, which

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.910
is an ebook, as well as
the book you've seen here.

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:27.760
So I'll start with
this question, Ron.

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:32.820
How does a 19-year-old
white kid from Brookline

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.135
become B.B. King's organ player?

00:01:35.135 --> 00:01:36.010
How does that happen?

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.760
RON LEVY: OK.

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:43.730
Well, first of all-- I'll sit
here-- I was 18, actually.

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:49.500
And actually my father and B.B.
belonged to the same squash

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.450
club, the Boston
Athletic Association.

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.330
And they used to-- they would
swap partners playing squash.

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:57.707
CHARLIE SAWYER: You're joking.

00:01:57.707 --> 00:01:58.540
RON LEVY: Yes, I am.

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:59.623
CHARLIE SAWYER: All right.

00:01:59.623 --> 00:02:01.370
RON LEVY: OK.

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:03.886
CHARLIE SAWYER: That's
not the B.B. I know.

00:02:03.886 --> 00:02:06.260
RON LEVY: Yeah, I figured you
didn't know that about B.B.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:07.020
CHARLIE SAWYER: No, I didn't.

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.880
RON LEVY: He was
excellent at squash.

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.840
He couldn't beat my dad, though.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.500
B.B. had him over a [INAUDIBLE].

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.289
CHARLIE SAWYER:
What's the real story?

00:02:14.289 --> 00:02:14.830
RON LEVY: OK.

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:21.970
So before I played with
B.B., I was-- actually,

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.010
I had first met B.B.
When I was about 15.

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:30.570
And I went to Roxbury
one Saturday night

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.035
to this place called
Louie's Lounge.

00:02:33.035 --> 00:02:38.490
And I was underage, and I
stood out there in the alleyway

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:41.750
and listened to the
music through the door.

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:42.250
OK.

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.430
So fast forward a
couple of years.

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:50.440
The same year, I had a
little band in high school.

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.090
And we ended-- Don Long, the
famous promoter here in Boston

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:01.110
who does many concerts and
owned The Paradise and what not.

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.350
He was going to
Harvard at the time,

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:07.960
and he was our manager
of my high school band.

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.190
And if you ask me
the name of the band,

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.850
we changed the name of the band
pretty much every other week.

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:18.240
So we had 50 different names
over the course of a couple

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.660
years.

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.470
But anyway, he got us
these gigs backing up

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.550
Big Mama Thornton
and John Lee Hooker.

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:30.370
And we became friends
with Muddy Waters Band

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:35.180
and Howling Wolf's
band at the Club 47,

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.540
and Luther Johnson, who played
with Muddy-- not the Luther

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:44.310
Johnson Guitar Junior, but the
Georgia boy Luther Johnson.

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.950
So we started to get into
this whole mix of playing

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.130
with these Bo Diddley
and Chuck Berry.

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.890
Whenever they would come to
town, we would play with them.

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.740
And then Albert King
was playing in Boston

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:59.550
and on Lennie's on the Pike.

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:03.900
And Lenny Sokolov, he just
passed away last week.

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.880
Well, anyway, we were opening
up the show for Albert.

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.670
And we finished our set,
and it was very nice crowd,

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:14.810
and they thought we were
great, for little kids playing.

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:18.000
And we just heard this ruckus
backstage and all this yelling

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:24.210
and furniture being moved
through the air against walls.

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.200
And turns out Albert
fired his band on the spot

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:32.280
and hired us to back him up.

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.300
Now he took my
drummer and myself

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:36.790
out on the road with him.

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:40.110
And that's a whole long story
that's funny in the book

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.290
that you'll hear about.

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:45.740
But after I had been with Albert
for about a year and a half--

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.860
and Albert was reputed to
be one of the hardest people

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:52.820
to work with-- I mean, it
was-- if you could survive

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:56.840
the wrath of Albert, you could
survive anything, I mean,

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.760
it was-- it was like
the blues Taliban.

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.291
CHARLIE SAWYER: Is it true that
he had a Thompson submachine

00:05:03.291 --> 00:05:03.790
gun?

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:05.310
RON LEVY: Yes, he did.

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:07.830
Many weapons.

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:10.840
But I only saw him
pull that out one time.

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.730
And he never played with
his guns or showed them off.

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:15.260
He was very responsibility.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:20.960
He was actually a deputy
Sheriff in Lovejoy, Illinois.

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.940
But after playing on
shows with Albert King

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:29.480
and doing double bills with
B.B. King and Albert King,

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:32.320
they started to take-- B.B.
King's band, Sonny Freeman,

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:34.640
the longtime bandleader
and drummer--

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:38.880
took notice of
Albert's little group.

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:42.270
And for some reason,
they pointed at me,

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:47.289
and when the slot opened
up, I got a call from Sonny.

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:48.830
Actually he called
my mother's house,

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:53.150
because I didn't have
my own phone then.

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:56.280
And the rest is in the book.

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:58.310
CHARLIE SAWYER:
So you were riding

00:05:58.310 --> 00:05:59.772
with the Kings, both of them.

00:05:59.772 --> 00:06:01.580
RON LEVY: Right.

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:08.310
And my first night with B.B.,
nobody welcomed me to the band.

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:11.930
There was no set list,
there was no instruction,

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:15.090
it was just, put
these clothes on,

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:19.290
get up there play your
butt off, and good luck.

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:20.930
And that was it.

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:25.510
Nobody-- we'll get into the
specifics of that a little bit

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:26.010
later.

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:27.970
CHARLIE SAWYER: Why don't you
give us a tour of the book now?

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:28.704
RON LEVY: OK.

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:41.610
Now this book here
is kind of my own--

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:46.360
I'd never seen anyone else do
this-- and I came up with this.

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:50.470
This is my website
here, as you can see.

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:53.450
I have to look here so
I know what I'm doing.

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:55.880
I think you can see it there.

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:59.170
And see where it says,
come for a test drive

00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:04.940
underneath the
picture of the book?

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:12.625
That takes you to another
page where it's got reviews,

00:07:12.625 --> 00:07:15.580
it's got Table of Contents,
Various Artists, Personalities

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:19.340
and Subjects, Open Letter
from the Author-- me.

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:24.010
And then it's got short
excerpts from the book.

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:26.420
So you kind of go for a
test drive on this, OK?

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:28.742
So we're going to open it up.

00:07:28.742 --> 00:07:32.030
We're gonna go to
the real book now.

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:40.880
And as you can see, we've
got a Table of Contents here.

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:44.820
And wasn't there a question
you wanted to ask me?

00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:46.080
We could go to the book.

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:50.780
Anyway, what we'll do is we'll
start-- since Charlie's here

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:55.350
we'll do the B.B. King
Chronicles, Chapter 3.

00:07:55.350 --> 00:08:02.230
So how I designed this
was to have the text

00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:04.890
and then have pictures
right next to it,

00:08:04.890 --> 00:08:07.420
just like a magazine.

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:11.410
And by being online I
was able to have, like,

00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:14.870
3,000 pictures on
the web book, where

00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:17.930
there's no way I could
have been able to do

00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:21.650
that if it was a print book.

00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:26.140
And then you'll notice,
you'll see it says Meter Maid.

00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:29.910
It's like red highlight there.

00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:34.080
And then you look
a little further.

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:38.780
And so this has really a
wealth of a lot of pictures.

00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:42.150
Here's a picture of B.B.
King with Sid Seidenberg, who

00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:45.950
was B.B.'s manager,
very-- brought

00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:48.150
blues to the whole world.

00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:50.060
And you'll see a
poster next to it

00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:52.340
that B.B. Headlined
over Jimi Hendrix.

00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:54.500
And it was one of
Hendrix's last shows

00:08:54.500 --> 00:09:00.680
in America, or anywhere
for that matter.

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:02.300
Sorry, Jimi.

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:03.759
Here's a picture
of B.B.'s old bus.

00:09:03.759 --> 00:09:05.591
CHARLIE SAWYER: That
picture of Ed Sullivan,

00:09:05.591 --> 00:09:06.480
I took that picture.

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:08.150
RON LEVY: There
was a picture of--

00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:09.750
CHARLIE SAWYER: There's
one at the High Chaparral,

00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:11.083
but it's farther down, probably.

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:15.180
But the picture of--

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:17.900
RON LEVY: The picture
that's in the print book.

00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:21.360
It's like-- so is that good?

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:25.183
Does anybody have any
questions about this?

00:09:25.183 --> 00:09:27.682
AUDIENCE: How long did it take
you to put the book together?

00:09:27.682 --> 00:09:32.030
RON LEVY: Well, it came
in different stages.

00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:38.050
The production of this on the
web book took about almost

00:09:38.050 --> 00:09:39.180
a year.

00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:42.240
And what I did, too--
I didn't work on it

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:46.310
for a full year just in a
row, because what I want to do

00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:49.380
is work on-- just dedicate
myself to it like for two

00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:53.690
or three, four months, and
then walk away from it.

00:09:53.690 --> 00:09:57.300
And I didn't even think about
it, I didn't like peek at it.

00:09:57.300 --> 00:09:58.770
I didn't do anything.

00:09:58.770 --> 00:10:00.920
And I wanted to just come
back like maybe a month

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:05.570
later, six to eight weeks later,
and just look at it fresh.

00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:08.000
Because I wanted everything
to get out of my mind so

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.520
I'd be able to look at it
how someone who had never

00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:14.080
seen it before would look at it.

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:18.240
And how I got this--how
this came about,

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:21.680
I did not plan this
from the beginning.

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:25.610
What happened was, when
I wrote my first draft,

00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:29.340
I sent emails to
various friends of mine

00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:33.150
that were there, at whatever
particular chapter I was in,

00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:38.150
to verify my facts and to
see, maybe I forgot something,

00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:41.010
or, you know, I would
tell them, read this.

00:10:41.010 --> 00:10:41.920
Did I get everything?

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:44.010
What was so-and-so's name?

00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:45.190
How do you spell this?

00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:47.000
And was that the town?

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.960
I had questions myself.

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:52.070
And most people were
just flabbergasted

00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:54.330
about how much I remembered.

00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:57.160
They just-- they were
going, oh my god.

00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:00.850
Actually, one of my
drummers said to me,

00:11:00.850 --> 00:11:03.540
he said, you know,
Lev, he goes, I

00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:06.020
read the chapter
about you and me.

00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:09.980
And he says, man, I was
going to take a shower

00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:13.802
and get dressed and go to
work and come pick you up.

00:11:13.802 --> 00:11:18.110
Because I had brought
the flavor of it.

00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:20.990
He goes, man, you put
me back like 10 years.

00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:25.000
I thought it was like today
that you were writing about.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.160
So it was a lot of fun and a lot
of the exchange on that regard.

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:33.430
But what happened was, when I
sent the emails to everybody,

00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:36.770
then I started adding
pictures to it.

00:11:36.770 --> 00:11:40.410
Then I started adding
links to YouTube

00:11:40.410 --> 00:11:45.310
and I started making
YouTube links myself.

00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:49.030
And it just kind of
morphed into this web book.

00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:51.980
And that's how it was.

00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:54.650
Another thing that was
particularly unbelievable

00:11:54.650 --> 00:11:57.970
about the production of
it was that every time I

00:11:57.970 --> 00:12:01.940
wrote about somebody
or had their picture,

00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:04.400
even if I hadn't spoken
with that person for 15,

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:08.560
20, sometimes 30 years,
within two or three days

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:10.560
afterwards I would hear
from somebody that we

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:13.140
knew in common, or I
would hear from them.

00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:14.480
It was unbelievable.

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:19.280
It was like a psychic ESP
thing going on, I mean,

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:21.130
cross country.

00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:24.350
And very much so of people
that had passed away.

00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:27.550
I could really
feel them with me.

00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:29.770
And I could really
transport myself

00:12:29.770 --> 00:12:33.660
back to whatever time
it was, and actually

00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:39.610
just completely recall exact
conversations that we had.

00:12:39.610 --> 00:12:42.990
It freaked me out, to
be honest with you.

00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:44.790
I couldn't believe it.

00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:48.270
And it just kept on happening
over and over and over again.

00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:52.290
And at one point--
Charlie remembers Cato,

00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:54.830
you gave me a beautiful
picture of him--

00:12:54.830 --> 00:13:01.140
and he and I had this adventure
that was just unbelievable.

00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:05.020
And it took me about two weeks
to write about this adventure.

00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:08.900
And I finally crafted
it and came with it,

00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:11.880
and I started to
read it to my wife,

00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:14.010
and I couldn't get through it.

00:13:14.010 --> 00:13:16.390
I started choking up.

00:13:16.390 --> 00:13:18.660
And I had to stop,
because otherwise I

00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:21.260
would have started crying.

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:26.250
And she came over to me and
she said, honey, are you OK?

00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:29.960
And I just said, you know, the
last two weeks it's like Cato

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:31.900
and I were together.

00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:34.320
So much, we were like sitting
next to each other riding

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:36.230
down the highway.

00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:38.170
And it's done now.

00:13:38.170 --> 00:13:40.050
I'm not going to see him again.

00:13:40.050 --> 00:13:43.560
I'm not gonna share
the experience again.

00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:47.960
Little did I know the 400
times I had to reread my drafts

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:49.390
and do the editing
and everything,

00:13:49.390 --> 00:13:52.470
that I would
experience it again.

00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:56.250
CHARLIE SAWYER: So
Cato started as B.B.'s

00:13:56.250 --> 00:13:57.775
bus driver and mechanic.

00:13:57.775 --> 00:14:01.440
RON LEVY: When I
was born, in 1951.

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:07.190
And Cato was the city boy
because he grew up in Memphis

00:14:07.190 --> 00:14:10.600
and went to college
and was on a train.

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:13.195
He worked on the trains, he was
a union member of the trains.

00:14:13.195 --> 00:14:14.236
CHARLIE SAWYER: Pullmans.

00:14:14.236 --> 00:14:16.640
RON LEVY: And B.B. was
the country boy that came.

00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:18.980
CHARLIE SAWYER: And Cato's
brother, [? Shinny ?] Walker

00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:20.542
was the bass player
in that band.

00:14:20.542 --> 00:14:22.250
RON LEVY: That's right,
at the beginning.

00:14:22.250 --> 00:14:26.100
CHARLIE SAWYER: And Cato's
wife Polly became B.B.'s--

00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:27.200
RON LEVY: Road manager.

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:28.408
CHARLIE SAWYER: Road manager.

00:14:28.408 --> 00:14:30.667
RON LEVY: She had the biggest
map of the United States

00:14:30.667 --> 00:14:31.750
I've ever seen in my life.

00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:33.630
It was like almost
as big as this.

00:14:33.630 --> 00:14:36.220
CHARLIE SAWYER: And
their son, Cato III,

00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:38.450
became B.B.'s horn player.

00:14:38.450 --> 00:14:39.820
RON LEVY: Right, years later.

00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:42.050
CHARLIE SAWYER: Years
and years later.

00:14:42.050 --> 00:14:47.110
And both Cato the elder
and Polly worked for B.B.

00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:48.320
Until the day they died.

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:49.330
RON LEVY: Exactly.

00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:53.820
And even when old man Cato,
as we used to call him--

00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:56.060
we also used to
call him Iron Jaws

00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:59.890
because he could talk
more than anybody

00:14:59.890 --> 00:15:01.510
that anybody had ever known.

00:15:01.510 --> 00:15:05.400
So we called him-- his
nickname was Iron Jaws.

00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:09.390
And I wrote in the book, he
could talk the bark off a tree.

00:15:09.390 --> 00:15:12.390
I mean, he could stand next to
a street lamp for five minutes

00:15:12.390 --> 00:15:14.070
and carry on a conversation.

00:15:14.070 --> 00:15:17.774
And it was like, Cato,
stop, it's like--

00:15:17.774 --> 00:15:19.690
So we're going to go
with some questions here?

00:15:19.690 --> 00:15:21.696
CHARLIE SAWYER: Yes,
come back, sit down.

00:15:21.696 --> 00:15:23.445
RON LEVY: We'll have
some more music, too.

00:15:29.029 --> 00:15:32.240
CHARLIE SAWYER: How
fast was the pace?

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:35.460
How many gigs did you
do in a typical year?

00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:36.360
RON LEVY: All right.

00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:40.200
Well, I've remarked that
we covered more miles

00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:42.400
back then than UPS does today.

00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:47.650
There was one time--
to just give you

00:15:47.650 --> 00:15:50.800
an idea of what
our schedule was--

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:55.990
one time we did a television
show in New York City,

00:15:55.990 --> 00:16:02.180
flew from La Guardia to
Chicago, played at a festival

00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:07.640
maybe about an hour outside of
Chicago, went back to O'Hare,

00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:10.210
and then flew to LAX.

00:16:10.210 --> 00:16:14.120
And we did a breakfast show
in South Central Los Angeles

00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:18.180
that night, like 2 o'clock,
3 o'clock in the morning.

00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:21.300
That was an extreme day.

00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:24.956
There were other times
when we played in Vegas,

00:16:24.956 --> 00:16:26.955
and we played at various
places like the Hilton,

00:16:26.955 --> 00:16:33.100
the Flamingo, Caesar's Palace,
that often we'd fly-- you know,

00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:36.290
those gigs were usually like 10
o'clock at night to 4 o'clock

00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:38.130
in the morning.

00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:40.150
And there was-- there
was another band.

00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:41.440
We would always alternate.

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:44.560
And then the other
bands, you're asking,

00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:49.600
would be like Little Richard
or Erroll Garner or Duke

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:53.370
Ellington, or they
would run the gamut.

00:16:53.370 --> 00:16:56.040
It was just unbelievable.

00:16:56.040 --> 00:17:00.671
And this was in the
lounge for the most part.

00:17:00.671 --> 00:17:02.420
But a lot of times
when we did those Vegas

00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:05.890
gigs, we would fly to LA in
the afternoon and play, like,

00:17:05.890 --> 00:17:09.730
"Midnight Special"
or "Sanford and Son"

00:17:09.730 --> 00:17:12.460
or one of those other TV shows.

00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:16.204
And then we'd fly back to Vegas
and play like a regular night.

00:17:16.204 --> 00:17:17.579
CHARLIE SAWYER:
Give us a number.

00:17:17.579 --> 00:17:19.660
How many gigs a year?

00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:21.460
RON LEVY: I Easily 300 plus.

00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:23.085
CHARLIE SAWYER: Did
you get a vacation?

00:17:23.085 --> 00:17:25.670
RON LEVY: No.

00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:28.249
Our vacation were our days off.

00:17:28.249 --> 00:17:30.540
CHARLIE SAWYER: So you did
have a day off now and then.

00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:31.400
RON LEVY: Yeah.

00:17:34.210 --> 00:17:38.240
If it was like a death in the
family or something like that,

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:40.305
you could take a personal day.

00:17:40.305 --> 00:17:42.600
CHARLIE SAWYER: And
what if you got sick?

00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:44.882
RON LEVY: That was
against the rules.

00:17:44.882 --> 00:17:46.340
CHARLIE SAWYER: If
you could walk--

00:17:48.985 --> 00:17:51.900
RON LEVY: I remember there was--
when I first joined the band,

00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:54.290
we played this festival.

00:17:54.290 --> 00:17:56.950
And Duke Ellington
was playing piano,

00:17:56.950 --> 00:18:01.120
Oscar Peterson was playing
piano, Ray Charles and Dave

00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:05.820
Brubeck-- and I saw
this on the schedule.

00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:09.550
We were in the hotel, and
I was like 18 years old.

00:18:09.550 --> 00:18:14.300
I called up Sonny and I said,
Sonny, I got a stomachache.

00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:16.170
I don't think I
can make this gig.

00:18:16.170 --> 00:18:20.600
And he was going, like,
well Ron, you gotta make it.

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:22.150
Do you need to go
to the hospital?

00:18:22.150 --> 00:18:23.260
And I said, well, no.

00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:25.220
I just I don't feel good.

00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:29.310
No way I can-- really
I was just nervous.

00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:32.110
Because I faked
it the whole time.

00:18:32.110 --> 00:18:34.270
And with these guys,
they don't fake it.

00:18:34.270 --> 00:18:37.550
Duke Ellington and everybody,
they don't fake it at all.

00:18:37.550 --> 00:18:46.330
And so finally, he kept on
asking me all these questions,

00:18:46.330 --> 00:18:50.450
and then I just said--
finally it came out,

00:18:50.450 --> 00:18:54.410
I forget how it came out, that
I was nervous to be in front.

00:18:54.410 --> 00:18:58.890
And he just started laughing,
and he was very big brother-ish

00:18:58.890 --> 00:19:01.170
to me, and very kindly to me.

00:19:01.170 --> 00:19:04.970
And he says, hey, Ron, you
know, we all feel like that.

00:19:04.970 --> 00:19:06.755
Your job is not to
be Duke Ellington

00:19:06.755 --> 00:19:09.320
or Oscar Peterson
or Dave Brubeck.

00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:14.000
Your job is to be Ron Levy,
B.B. King's piano player.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:18.280
Just worry about doing that
job and you'll be fine.

00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:21.946
And that was like
the best advice.

00:19:21.946 --> 00:19:24.770
CHARLIE SAWYER: And what
about if B.B. got sick?

00:19:24.770 --> 00:19:26.220
Did B.B. ever get sick?

00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:27.590
Did B.B. ever cancel a date?

00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:29.830
RON LEVY: No, you
couldn't get sick, man.

00:19:29.830 --> 00:19:35.330
Another time we were Japan,
and I woke up one morning,

00:19:35.330 --> 00:19:39.250
and I got up from the bed
and went the bathroom.

00:19:39.250 --> 00:19:42.130
And I had all these red
spots all over my face.

00:19:42.130 --> 00:19:45.612
I couldn't believe it,
as bright as this shirt.

00:19:45.612 --> 00:19:47.820
And it was like some kind
of chicken pox or something

00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:48.319
like this.

00:19:48.319 --> 00:19:50.430
It was a Sunday.

00:19:50.430 --> 00:19:55.300
And so I called Leroy, the
manager, and the doctor

00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:57.370
wasn't there at the Hilton.

00:19:57.370 --> 00:20:03.960
So they sent me to some
doctor in Japan, in Tokyo.

00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:06.240
And the driver, all
he had was a piece

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:09.900
of paper written in Japanese
to where I was supposed to go.

00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:12.260
And he just dropped
me off on this corner.

00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:16.310
And it was like, I
couldn't read anything.

00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:17.570
Everything was in Japanese.

00:20:17.570 --> 00:20:19.190
I didn't know where
to go, I don't

00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:22.290
know how to get
another cab, whatever.

00:20:22.290 --> 00:20:25.150
And he started driving away,
and I just ran down the street

00:20:25.150 --> 00:20:27.332
and chased after-- he
was stopped at a light.

00:20:27.332 --> 00:20:29.040
I said, man, I'm going
back to the hotel.

00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:31.490
Hilton, Hilton, Hilton.

00:20:31.490 --> 00:20:32.340
That was it.

00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:37.120
And then Old Man Cato told
me-- he knew somebody,

00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:39.490
and they told me
to drink some tea.

00:20:39.490 --> 00:20:45.690
So I drank some tea, and somehow
I felt better after that.

00:20:45.690 --> 00:20:49.520
My fever came down and
I wasn't all flushed.

00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:51.150
I wasn't all red and all that.

00:20:51.150 --> 00:20:52.950
But you couldn't get sick.

00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:55.440
I mean, it was just not allowed.

00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:58.490
CHARLIE SAWYER: So
you're playing 300

00:20:58.490 --> 00:21:01.900
plus out of 365 days a year.

00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:03.930
And you did that
with no vacation.

00:21:03.930 --> 00:21:06.400
And you did that
for seven years,

00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:08.160
and you lived to tell about it.

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:11.680
How did you do that?

00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:16.140
RON LEVY: Well, I'm
very blessed and lucky.

00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:18.344
There's lot of times I
wouldn't have made it.

00:21:18.344 --> 00:21:20.760
And there were times since I
wouldn't have made it either.

00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:22.300
CHARLIE SAWYER: You
were a lot younger then.

00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:23.800
RON LEVY: I was a lot younger.

00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:28.370
And I don't really
have the desire

00:21:28.370 --> 00:21:30.720
to do something like that again.

00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:32.350
It was a lot more
fun when you're

00:21:32.350 --> 00:21:37.750
in your teens and your 20s
than it is now, 40 years later.

00:21:37.750 --> 00:21:41.715
CHARLIE SAWYER: There's one
story about the trailer, when

00:21:41.715 --> 00:21:44.360
you had an extra
day in the trailer

00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:46.762
that you left at the hotel.

00:21:46.762 --> 00:21:47.490
RON LEVY: OK.

00:21:47.490 --> 00:21:49.920
Now that's when I
was with Albert King.

00:21:52.670 --> 00:21:53.846
You want me to read that?

00:21:53.846 --> 00:21:54.846
CHARLIE SAWYER: You can.

00:21:54.846 --> 00:21:55.346
Go ahead.

00:21:59.972 --> 00:22:01.680
RON LEVY: This is when
I was with Albert.

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:08.620
And Albert was a very
demanding person.

00:22:17.250 --> 00:22:20.290
Albert, for instance--
you'll see in this chapter,

00:22:20.290 --> 00:22:27.280
too-- he would fire guys like
in the middle of Nebraska

00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:31.090
if they didn't respect
him the right way.

00:22:31.090 --> 00:22:32.095
OK, here we go.

00:22:53.450 --> 00:22:55.270
Well, we had this
wonderful gig--

00:22:55.270 --> 00:22:58.100
I'll set it up for
you--at the Fillmore West.

00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:00.760
And all these--
we were so tired.

00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:05.930
We had driven from St. Louis all
the way out to San Francisco.

00:23:05.930 --> 00:23:11.030
And we wanted to
just do our show.

00:23:11.030 --> 00:23:15.530
But then all these guys came
like Santana, and this Garcia

00:23:15.530 --> 00:23:19.360
guy from Grateful Dead,
and all these other people.

00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:21.440
And they kept jamming
and wanted to jam.

00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:24.205
And we were like, oh man, we
just want to finish our show

00:23:24.205 --> 00:23:25.630
and go home.

00:23:25.630 --> 00:23:29.060
And every time it seemed
like one guy would go away,

00:23:29.060 --> 00:23:30.760
there would be
another guy come out.

00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:35.290
And the thing about
it was, in the band,

00:23:35.290 --> 00:23:38.310
we hated that, because we
wanted to do our show that

00:23:38.310 --> 00:23:41.570
was rehearsed and prepared,
and we knew what we were going.

00:23:41.570 --> 00:23:45.930
And to throw in these wild
cards kind of just ruined it.

00:23:45.930 --> 00:23:48.450
And they tried to
play against Albert,

00:23:48.450 --> 00:23:50.110
and that was ridiculous.

00:23:50.110 --> 00:23:52.480
I mean, it was just
like a Little Leaguer

00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:55.050
going up against John Lester.

00:23:55.050 --> 00:23:57.910
It didn't make sense.

00:23:57.910 --> 00:24:02.040
So anyway, we had a long
night and we finally--

00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:04.360
this is when we wake
up next morning.

00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:06.240
"After a good night's
rest, we woke up

00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:08.500
to one of those beautiful
California dreamy,

00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:11.450
sunny days that
made it so famous,

00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:13.510
drawing folks from
all over the world

00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:16.550
to the scenic Bay Area for
the past few hundred years

00:24:16.550 --> 00:24:19.040
now and always will.

00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:21.690
That and Rice-A-Roni, of course.

00:24:21.690 --> 00:24:24.745
"We stayed at a very nice,
clean, respectable motel

00:24:24.745 --> 00:24:26.350
on Van Ness
Boulevard pretty much

00:24:26.350 --> 00:24:27.970
in the heart of San Francisco.

00:24:27.970 --> 00:24:31.790
From the second-story deck,
sipping motel room coffee,

00:24:31.790 --> 00:24:35.190
admiring the shiny
golden state, we also

00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:38.200
noticed, to our combined
pleasant surprise,

00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:41.490
that the Imperial,
Albert's car, was absent.

00:24:41.490 --> 00:24:44.260
Albert was up and gone.

00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:47.600
We were really free.

00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:49.800
"Such a beautiful city.

00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:50.610
What to do?

00:24:50.610 --> 00:24:53.370
Go to one of San Francisco's
wonderful museums,

00:24:53.370 --> 00:24:57.050
visit their gorgeous
library, picnic in the park

00:24:57.050 --> 00:25:01.280
by the Golden Gate Bridge, take
a guided tour of all the sites,

00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:04.910
drive around and admire San
Francisco's fine architecture,

00:25:04.910 --> 00:25:08.350
ride a cable car, explore
Chinatown, the waterfront,

00:25:08.350 --> 00:25:12.220
a ballgame, visit
Alcatraz, maybe?

00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:13.340
Nah, I don't think so.

00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:15.620
We were looking for
some action, also known

00:25:15.620 --> 00:25:19.090
as trouble, as
young man often do.

00:25:19.090 --> 00:25:21.770
We conspired to chain and
lock the equipment trailer

00:25:21.770 --> 00:25:23.510
to one of the wooden
posts holding up

00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:27.250
the deck we were perched
on, take the freed wagon,

00:25:27.250 --> 00:25:29.950
and head down to the
Fillmore district.

00:25:29.950 --> 00:25:32.110
And we planned to meet
up with some hippies

00:25:32.110 --> 00:25:34.030
and see what the
counterculture had

00:25:34.030 --> 00:25:37.740
to offer the stars
of last night's show.

00:25:37.740 --> 00:25:40.180
"I don't exactly
remember what we did

00:25:40.180 --> 00:25:43.160
or who we met down
there, as it was later

00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:46.330
obscured by events
beyond our control.

00:25:46.330 --> 00:25:48.310
But after a few hours
or so of seeking

00:25:48.310 --> 00:25:52.030
to fulfill our aimless and
restless desires in vain,

00:25:52.030 --> 00:25:54.370
we figured it would be best
to head back and chill out

00:25:54.370 --> 00:25:58.630
at the motel before Albert
returned from his own forays.

00:25:58.630 --> 00:26:01.600
"As we pulled into
the motel's carport,

00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:04.470
we all turned white,
me even whiter,

00:26:04.470 --> 00:26:09.190
at the site of Albert's towering
over several of San Francisco's

00:26:09.190 --> 00:26:12.170
finest, also surrounded
by four or five

00:26:12.170 --> 00:26:16.140
black and white red-domed
police cruisers.

00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:18.080
One Oh, wow, man.

00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:20.305
At first confused
and instantly jolted

00:26:20.305 --> 00:26:23.260
with a soaring spike
of adrenaline rush,

00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:28.060
screaming all together
now, 'Oh, shit!

00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:30.730
The trailer's gone!'

00:26:30.730 --> 00:26:34.187
"Our first basic instinct
was to make a break for it

00:26:34.187 --> 00:26:37.170
and race back to St.
Louis towards survival.

00:26:37.170 --> 00:26:40.560
But Albert saw us first and
bellowed, 'There they are!

00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:43.250
Come on here!' and waved us in.

00:26:43.250 --> 00:26:46.910
Maybe we would experience
Alcatraz for real after all.

00:26:46.910 --> 00:26:49.290
It seemed a far better
fate at the time

00:26:49.290 --> 00:26:53.880
than the impending wrath of Mr.
King we all justly anticipated.

00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:57.180
I don't ever remember wanting
to lock myself in the car

00:26:57.180 --> 00:27:01.150
before or since, but
I certainly did then."

00:27:01.150 --> 00:27:04.630
And so to finish up the story--

00:27:04.630 --> 00:27:07.160
CHARLIE SAWYER: How did
they get the trailer?

00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:07.980
It was chained.

00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:09.230
RON LEVY: They sawed the post.

00:27:11.740 --> 00:27:15.210
CHARLIE SAWYER: The post holding
up the rest of the hotel.

00:27:15.210 --> 00:27:16.620
RON LEVY: Well, OK.

00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:20.400
I'll finish-- let me
jump ahead a little bit.

00:27:24.530 --> 00:27:27.280
"We had all lost everything
we had and needed, as it were,

00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:28.960
and all suffered equally.

00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:31.040
As it turned out, there
had been a recent rash

00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:32.880
of such incidents
in the Bay Area

00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:35.730
that the San Francisco
detectives were already

00:27:35.730 --> 00:27:37.380
forelorn to talk about.

00:27:37.380 --> 00:27:39.430
None of us were to
blame, but much thanks

00:27:39.430 --> 00:27:43.290
to the ingenuity of the brazen
banditos who had sawed out

00:27:43.290 --> 00:27:47.080
a four-inch-wide section through
the wooden post which held up

00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:49.360
the upper walkway,
slid the chain

00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:50.870
through in broad
daylight, no less,

00:27:50.870 --> 00:27:53.245
and taken our trailer,
thus proving we

00:27:53.245 --> 00:27:56.060
had taken the normal
responsible precaution

00:27:56.060 --> 00:27:58.726
by chaining the trailer."

00:27:58.726 --> 00:28:06.320
CHARLIE SAWYER: So you lost
your instruments, your clothes,

00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:07.880
and your Hammond.

00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:11.200
RON LEVY: "Albert was visibly
upset but totally comical,

00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:13.550
in a normal but stern,
official-like voice

00:28:13.550 --> 00:28:17.480
informed us the police,
his distant west coast

00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:19.330
cousins of law
enforcement, needed

00:28:19.330 --> 00:28:21.490
us to answer a few questions.

00:28:21.490 --> 00:28:23.270
Everything proceeded
in relatively calm,

00:28:23.270 --> 00:28:27.070
professional order despite our
shared internal heart-pounding

00:28:27.070 --> 00:28:29.600
and nerve-numbing
vibrating state we were.

00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:35.040
It was, I'm telling you--
we were so scared of him.

00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:37.430
"Times, names, places
were formally recorded,

00:28:37.430 --> 00:28:39.710
as well as the
trailer's contents.

00:28:39.710 --> 00:28:44.410
One Hammond B-3 organ bench,
Leslie 147 tone cabinet

00:28:44.410 --> 00:28:49.300
and cable box, one Fender jazz
bass guitar Sunburst, one set

00:28:49.300 --> 00:28:53.500
of Blue Sparkle Rogers drums
with cymbals, one acoustic bass

00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:57.430
amp, one acoustic guitar amp,
four suitcases of clothes,

00:28:57.430 --> 00:29:00.430
and a couple of trunks
belonging to Mr. King.

00:29:00.430 --> 00:29:04.710
One tool box and two Gibson
Flying V electric guitars.

00:29:04.710 --> 00:29:06.870
Albert's Lucy had
been kidnapped along

00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:08.272
with her identical twin sister."

00:29:08.272 --> 00:29:09.730
CHARLIE SAWYER:
Did you ever get it

00:29:09.730 --> 00:29:12.800
back, the contents
of the trailer?

00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:14.900
RON LEVY: My footnote.

00:29:14.900 --> 00:29:17.710
The trailer was discovered
some two or three years later

00:29:17.710 --> 00:29:20.050
in a warehouse full
of other stolen items

00:29:20.050 --> 00:29:22.010
as well which had
caught fire down

00:29:22.010 --> 00:29:24.680
in some industrial
area of Frisco.

00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:27.550
All of our contents
remained intact.

00:29:27.550 --> 00:29:31.235
The trailer was never opened
until police examined it

00:29:31.235 --> 00:29:33.660
and matched the items
with our filed complaint.

00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:37.910
This was before computers,
mind you, long ago.

00:29:37.910 --> 00:29:39.710
The Frisco police
department said

00:29:39.710 --> 00:29:44.080
Albert called my mother to
inform her of the recovery.

00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:47.870
Her/my phone number was listed
on the original police report.

00:29:47.870 --> 00:29:50.100
Albert was gracious enough
to pay for the shipping

00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:52.962
and crating back
to Brookline, Mass.

00:29:52.962 --> 00:29:55.640
CHARLIE SAWYER: So, Ron,
while you're up there,

00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:58.790
there's one-- one of the
best stories you tell,

00:29:58.790 --> 00:30:01.470
which speaks to the
whole question of race.

00:30:01.470 --> 00:30:05.270
And that's the episode
onstage with Nina Simone.

00:30:05.270 --> 00:30:11.260
RON LEVY: You know, that
was one stupid episode.

00:30:11.260 --> 00:30:17.240
And I have to say
that, you know,

00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:21.390
you said that about how
was I treated in the band,

00:30:21.390 --> 00:30:24.520
being the only Jewish guy?

00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:31.490
But they did
whatever I said when

00:30:31.490 --> 00:30:33.085
we went to Israel, trust me.

00:30:38.845 --> 00:30:41.560
You know, we were
all like brothers.

00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:46.990
And some of us, like Little
Joe from Chicago on trombone,

00:30:46.990 --> 00:30:49.740
he and I are in
constant contact today.

00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:50.940
And we were best friends.

00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:54.210
We were like 17
and 18 years old.

00:30:54.210 --> 00:31:02.630
And we're like very
much close, very close.

00:31:02.630 --> 00:31:07.950
And a lot of the
guys in the band,

00:31:07.950 --> 00:31:11.230
after I left B.B. and I
became a record producer

00:31:11.230 --> 00:31:15.230
and traveled around the country,
I hired a lot of those guys

00:31:15.230 --> 00:31:17.010
to play in my sessions.

00:31:17.010 --> 00:31:19.710
And we made some great
records together.

00:31:22.470 --> 00:31:37.680
But this actually--
OK, this was in 1972.

00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:41.090
Down in New Orleans in 1972,
we played the New Orleans Jazz

00:31:41.090 --> 00:31:42.590
and Heritage Festival.

00:31:42.590 --> 00:31:43.740
It was a glorious day.

00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:47.190
Quint Davis and Allison
Miner-- blessed memory--

00:31:47.190 --> 00:31:49.510
both good friends, were
perfect hosts as well as

00:31:49.510 --> 00:31:53.450
the main original organizers
of this wonderful longstanding

00:31:53.450 --> 00:31:54.340
annual event.

00:31:57.340 --> 00:31:59.650
Willy T, Bo Dallas,
and The Wild Magnolias

00:31:59.650 --> 00:32:04.050
opened the show
with us to follow.

00:32:04.050 --> 00:32:07.270
WIlly T was a dear
friend of mine,

00:32:07.270 --> 00:32:10.450
and his brother played
alto saxophone with B.B.,

00:32:10.450 --> 00:32:13.090
and there's a
bunch of adventures

00:32:13.090 --> 00:32:15.420
that we had in New Orleans, too.

00:32:15.420 --> 00:32:18.030
But to quote Dan
Morgenstern and Paul Lynch

00:32:18.030 --> 00:32:21.460
from the "Downbeat"
article that summer:

00:32:21.460 --> 00:32:24.640
"B.B. Felt like playing, and
his guitar work was phenomenal.

00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:26.840
Lucille was talking
on his records,

00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:31.490
King often backed by
indifferent studio groups.

00:32:31.490 --> 00:32:34.306
If you really want
to hear him, hear

00:32:34.306 --> 00:32:37.270
him live with his own band,
creating that unique rapport

00:32:37.270 --> 00:32:39.120
with his audience.

00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:42.040
In B.B.'s nine-piece band
there is one white musician,

00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:43.270
pianist Ron Levy.

00:32:43.270 --> 00:32:46.510
And therefore hangs a tale."

00:32:46.510 --> 00:32:48.760
That's how I got
"Tales of a Road Dog."

00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:52.090
"At the point in the set where
B.B. introduces all the side

00:32:52.090 --> 00:32:54.380
men, also doing a rap
with the audience,

00:32:54.380 --> 00:32:56.290
the music slows down to a vamp.

00:32:59.150 --> 00:33:02.330
While everyone's attention
was focused on B.B.,

00:33:02.330 --> 00:33:07.610
Nina Simone emerged stage
left with Don Pullen in tow.

00:33:07.610 --> 00:33:09.550
I happened to see them
and kept watching.

00:33:09.550 --> 00:33:13.300
"Next, Ms. Simone tapped
Ron Levy's shoulder

00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:16.110
and motioned him away
from the keyboard.

00:33:16.110 --> 00:33:18.560
She sat down on the piano
bench, pulling along

00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:21.090
with somewhat unwilling
Pullen and began

00:33:21.090 --> 00:33:24.190
to play, demonstrating
a blues vamp.

00:33:24.190 --> 00:33:26.980
She then got up and
indicated for Pullen to stay

00:33:26.980 --> 00:33:28.930
and left the stage.

00:33:28.930 --> 00:33:33.290
"Levy soon reappeared
looking a bit bewildered.

00:33:33.290 --> 00:33:35.530
And now the rap was
ending and the next number

00:33:35.530 --> 00:33:37.430
was about to begin.

00:33:37.430 --> 00:33:40.680
Missing the customary intro,
B.B. peeped at the piano

00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:42.000
from the corner of his eye.

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:44.020
Levy finally grasped
Pullen's shoulder

00:33:44.020 --> 00:33:46.930
and regained his rightful place.

00:33:46.930 --> 00:33:49.390
"Inquiring later as to
what this was all about,

00:33:49.390 --> 00:33:51.350
my worst suspicions
were confirmed.

00:33:51.350 --> 00:33:55.030
Ms. Simone, feeling that a soul
brother should be at the piano,

00:33:55.030 --> 00:33:58.380
had instigated the whole thing.

00:33:58.380 --> 00:34:00.730
Aside from a total lack
of professionalism,

00:34:00.730 --> 00:34:04.240
this incident was a disgraceful
display of prejudice

00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:08.500
in action, wholly out place at a
jazz festival, the sole jarring

00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:11.250
note of the entire four days."

00:34:11.250 --> 00:34:14.320
So that was from
"Downbeat" magazine.

00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:15.715
So now this is my commentary.

00:34:18.219 --> 00:34:24.250
"As it turned out, I got
fined $50 for this incident.

00:34:24.250 --> 00:34:26.670
When Miss Nina tapped me
on the shoulder initially,

00:34:26.670 --> 00:34:28.469
I figured she and
B.B. had arranged

00:34:28.469 --> 00:34:33.120
this as a jam-type collaboration
as a special event,

00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:36.885
as was very common, until
she told me point blank,

00:34:36.885 --> 00:34:38.260
"You shouldn't be
up here playing

00:34:38.260 --> 00:34:41.690
the blues with B.B. King, you
white honky peckerwood son

00:34:41.690 --> 00:34:42.969
of a bitch.

00:34:42.969 --> 00:34:45.989
Go back home where you belong."

00:34:45.989 --> 00:34:47.260
What a lovely lady.

00:34:47.260 --> 00:34:50.340
Too bad she was so ugly, too.

00:34:50.340 --> 00:34:51.940
Love hearing her
version of "Please

00:34:51.940 --> 00:34:53.760
Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood."

00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:56.360
I didn't.

00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:58.720
My feelings weren't hurt at all.

00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:01.430
I just figured she was
a crazy, bitter lady.

00:35:01.430 --> 00:35:04.060
However, I had already
gotten up for her

00:35:04.060 --> 00:35:08.820
as a professional courtesy
and was kind of stuck

00:35:08.820 --> 00:35:13.030
in a no white man's
zone for a moment.

00:35:13.030 --> 00:35:16.530
Old Man Cato came right up to me
and said, "What you doin', boy?

00:35:16.530 --> 00:35:18.170
Get on back up there.

00:35:18.170 --> 00:35:20.190
You done lost your mind?

00:35:20.190 --> 00:35:21.350
Go back to your spot.

00:35:21.350 --> 00:35:22.590
Damn, boy."

00:35:22.590 --> 00:35:23.690
So I did.

00:35:23.690 --> 00:35:25.910
Now this time, Don Pullen
an excellent pianist

00:35:25.910 --> 00:35:29.530
who later played with Charles
Mingus, was at the piano.

00:35:29.530 --> 00:35:30.950
I politely took over.

00:35:30.950 --> 00:35:34.050
He was cool and as
befuddled as I was.

00:35:34.050 --> 00:35:36.680
We ended up hanging out and
laughing about it all later.

00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:40.220
He confirmed my suspicions,
and we remained casual friends

00:35:40.220 --> 00:35:42.280
for years.

00:35:42.280 --> 00:35:45.220
Back in our trailer
dressing room after our set,

00:35:45.220 --> 00:35:48.200
B.B. cleared the room
and read me the riot act.

00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:50.330
Oh boy, what a day.

00:35:50.330 --> 00:35:52.390
In rather coarse
language he asked me

00:35:52.390 --> 00:35:54.750
what the hell I
was thinking about.

00:35:54.750 --> 00:35:58.810
I brilliantly
responded, I don't know.

00:35:58.810 --> 00:36:02.680
He further scolded me some more,
then told him I had figured he

00:36:02.680 --> 00:36:04.910
and Miss Simone had
planned it together,

00:36:04.910 --> 00:36:07.090
but without her
comments, of course.

00:36:07.090 --> 00:36:08.960
I left that out.

00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:12.790
He then asked me, did I tell
you anything about this?

00:36:12.790 --> 00:36:15.310
And I responded, B,
I'm not privy to all

00:36:15.310 --> 00:36:17.250
your plans or decisions.

00:36:17.250 --> 00:36:18.960
I'm just a side man.

00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:22.460
B.B.: Well, if you want to
remain a side man in my band,

00:36:22.460 --> 00:36:24.910
you best only get up
when I tell you to

00:36:24.910 --> 00:36:27.400
and nobody else, understand?

00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:31.520
It's going to cost you $50
to teach you a lesson, son.

00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:34.280
Don't ever do that again, OK?

00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:36.920
I learned my lesson and
never shared with him

00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:37.810
what she'd said.

00:36:41.420 --> 00:36:44.990
Then, interestingly enough,
when the "Downbeat" article

00:36:44.990 --> 00:36:47.540
appeared a month or two
later, after B.B. read it,

00:36:47.540 --> 00:36:51.780
he slipped me back the $50
and took me record shopping.

00:36:51.780 --> 00:36:54.230
I had pretty much forgotten
all about this episode

00:36:54.230 --> 00:36:57.050
until-- bla bla bla bla bla.

00:36:57.050 --> 00:37:00.500
The lady was doing a
biography of Nina Simone

00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:03.471
and she reminded-- I
completely forgot about it.

00:37:03.471 --> 00:37:04.990
CHARLIE SAWYER: Wonderful.

00:37:04.990 --> 00:37:08.150
I have a couple of kind of
technical questions, musician's

00:37:08.150 --> 00:37:09.480
questions.

00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:12.400
Now B.B. didn't play
from a set list.

00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:13.015
RON LEVY: No.

00:37:13.015 --> 00:37:13.515
Never.

00:37:13.515 --> 00:37:14.681
CHARLIE SAWYER: And he was--

00:37:14.681 --> 00:37:16.620
RON LEVY: Not back then.

00:37:16.620 --> 00:37:20.670
After I left, towards the end,
the last year I was with him,

00:37:20.670 --> 00:37:24.549
we changed the whole band,
then we went to a show.

00:37:24.549 --> 00:37:25.840
And that's kind of when I left.

00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:29.860
CHARLIE SAWYER: He was known
for his reading audiences

00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:33.550
and knowing just how to
navigate through his repertoire.

00:37:33.550 --> 00:37:41.710
How did you know what to play,
when he would capriciously

00:37:41.710 --> 00:37:42.380
decide--

00:37:42.380 --> 00:37:44.720
RON LEVY: It was
our job to know.

00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:46.910
CHARLIE SAWYER:
Was it telepathy?

00:37:46.910 --> 00:37:47.714
Was there a signal?

00:37:47.714 --> 00:37:49.380
RON LEVY: Well, you
know, when I learned

00:37:49.380 --> 00:37:53.640
how to play piano when I was
a kid, I saw Ray Charles.

00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:58.020
The next day I brought
the radio from the kitchen

00:37:58.020 --> 00:38:00.170
into our parlor.

00:38:00.170 --> 00:38:02.000
And I put on the
radio and I just

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:04.120
started going like
this with my finger,

00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:06.570
trying to catch
whatever notes I could

00:38:06.570 --> 00:38:10.880
from the songs on the radio,
from WILD at the time.

00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:14.390
And so I don't know,
maybe it was just a gift.

00:38:14.390 --> 00:38:18.100
If I hear a certain tone,
I can go right to the piano

00:38:18.100 --> 00:38:20.190
and hit it.

00:38:20.190 --> 00:38:22.910
But a lot of it
took a lot of ESP.

00:38:22.910 --> 00:38:27.570
You just had to know B. and
how he would read the audience.

00:38:27.570 --> 00:38:30.500
You had to learn
and just sense what

00:38:30.500 --> 00:38:34.660
he was going to do, and
then learn from him,

00:38:34.660 --> 00:38:36.940
and say, OK, I bet
he's going to do this.

00:38:36.940 --> 00:38:40.030
When we would do a show we
did a couple songs to open up

00:38:40.030 --> 00:38:43.360
before he came on,
warm up the crowd.

00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:46.940
But as soon as he hit the
stage, there was no count.

00:38:46.940 --> 00:38:49.210
Personally, he never
counted off any songs.

00:38:49.210 --> 00:38:52.940
He never went one, two, this
is in the key of B flat.

00:38:52.940 --> 00:38:54.250
No, none of that.

00:38:54.250 --> 00:38:56.550
It was just boom!

00:38:56.550 --> 00:39:00.380
And you just had to know.

00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:03.400
And we always started out with
"Every Day I Have the Blues,"

00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:05.720
which was in B flat.

00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:07.850
But even that, there was
never a count up to that.

00:39:07.850 --> 00:39:10.140
Sonny would hit
the drums, go whap!

00:39:10.140 --> 00:39:22.174
And the song would just
go, whap! [HUMS NOTES]

00:39:22.174 --> 00:39:23.590
CHARLIE SAWYER:
And meanwhile B.B.

00:39:23.590 --> 00:39:25.980
would be [INAUDIBLE]
on his guitar--

00:39:25.980 --> 00:39:28.000
RON LEVY: And you
just had to know

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:30.230
what tempo it was going to be.

00:39:30.230 --> 00:39:31.150
That we knew.

00:39:31.150 --> 00:39:32.860
We knew that was
going to be B flat

00:39:32.860 --> 00:39:35.090
and it was going
to be very fast.

00:39:35.090 --> 00:39:38.530
Then we would break into
"How Blue Can You Get",

00:39:38.530 --> 00:39:43.480
and the key is dog, as we
used to call it, which is D.

00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:48.080
And you say "dog" because, you
know, singing over a crowd, D,

00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:51.390
you don't know if someone's
saying B or G or C or whatever.

00:39:51.390 --> 00:39:53.920
You just go, dog.

00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:57.650
But then after that, it was
all up to whatever B.B. did.

00:39:57.650 --> 00:40:00.920
And sometimes he would
play half of a song

00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:03.590
and in the middle of a song
he just wouldn't feel it

00:40:03.590 --> 00:40:06.660
or he didn't like it,
and he would just, zap!

00:40:06.660 --> 00:40:08.340
And go to another
key, and just go

00:40:08.340 --> 00:40:10.370
to a completely different song.

00:40:10.370 --> 00:40:12.620
And you had to be
there and just know.

00:40:12.620 --> 00:40:16.770
CHARLIE SAWYER: So I've seen
many times, he'd start to sing.

00:40:16.770 --> 00:40:19.070
And he'd be uncomfortable
with the key.

00:40:19.070 --> 00:40:21.380
And he'd want to modulate
the key half a step

00:40:21.380 --> 00:40:22.740
or a whole step.

00:40:22.740 --> 00:40:24.420
And it seemed like magic.

00:40:24.420 --> 00:40:26.920
All of a sudden the band
would play two or three

00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:29.280
chords and the key would change.

00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:30.456
How was that cued?

00:40:30.456 --> 00:40:31.710
RON LEVY: It wasn't.

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:37.240
We just had to know.

00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:38.770
It was human.

00:40:38.770 --> 00:40:41.500
Not like a computer, where
you have to program everything

00:40:41.500 --> 00:40:42.100
perfectly.

00:40:42.100 --> 00:40:43.090
This was human beings.

00:40:43.090 --> 00:40:45.260
CHARLIE SAWYER: Don't
badmouth computers.

00:40:45.260 --> 00:40:47.550
Don't badmouth computers either.

00:40:47.550 --> 00:40:49.150
RON LEVY: This was before them.

00:40:49.150 --> 00:40:50.530
That's how we did it back then.

00:40:50.530 --> 00:40:53.090
We didn't have all these tools.

00:40:53.090 --> 00:40:58.190
But now, like when we did
the "Cook County Jail" album,

00:40:58.190 --> 00:41:01.250
the piano that I played
at was a prison piano.

00:41:01.250 --> 00:41:03.990
They didn't bring in a special
piano for the recording

00:41:03.990 --> 00:41:04.710
session.

00:41:04.710 --> 00:41:08.086
It was the one that was
in the rec hall there.

00:41:08.086 --> 00:41:09.460
And it probably
hadn't been tuned

00:41:09.460 --> 00:41:13.000
since it was built
in, like, 1898.

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:15.390
And we tried to tune up
to it at the beginning.

00:41:15.390 --> 00:41:19.120
And actually on the album you
can hear, I'm hitting this note

00:41:19.120 --> 00:41:21.020
and the horns is trying
to squeeze their--

00:41:21.020 --> 00:41:27.220
breathe their mouthpieces and
do all this, and try and get it.

00:41:27.220 --> 00:41:30.670
So when everybody else
was playing in A flat,

00:41:30.670 --> 00:41:33.240
I had to play in A natural.

00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:37.610
Because any time we played,
I had to play a half step up

00:41:37.610 --> 00:41:39.770
because the piano was so flat.

00:41:39.770 --> 00:41:43.971
So it would kind of even out as
good as-- or as best we could.

00:41:43.971 --> 00:41:45.720
But that was just
something you had to do.

00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:48.170
It wasn't like you
could talk about it,

00:41:48.170 --> 00:41:52.420
or say, OK, we got a
tuning adjuster thing

00:41:52.420 --> 00:41:54.290
like they have on
electric pianos now.

00:41:54.290 --> 00:41:56.850
No, we just did it.

00:41:56.850 --> 00:41:59.290
CHARLIE SAWYER: You
folks are very quiet.

00:41:59.290 --> 00:42:01.180
Do you have questions?

00:42:01.180 --> 00:42:04.270
RON LEVY: You've got some
more good questions here.

00:42:04.270 --> 00:42:06.770
You said, how did you manage
to live a life living that way

00:42:06.770 --> 00:42:09.450
day after day, year after year?

00:42:09.450 --> 00:42:11.160
It was like being in the army.

00:42:11.160 --> 00:42:14.030
And we even had
uniforms, band uniforms.

00:42:14.030 --> 00:42:19.900
But it was-- every single
person except for Sonny Freeman

00:42:19.900 --> 00:42:23.750
at least got married and
divorced at least once.

00:42:23.750 --> 00:42:26.280
Everybody that came
into the band married

00:42:26.280 --> 00:42:32.610
was divorced, sometimes two or
three times with different--

00:42:32.610 --> 00:42:34.620
the longer I stayed in
the band, and if somebody

00:42:34.620 --> 00:42:37.860
was in the band for a
long time, that happened.

00:42:37.860 --> 00:42:40.560
Very high divorce rate.

00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:43.500
Who paid your traveling
expenses, your plane tickets,

00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:44.325
hotels, food?

00:42:47.510 --> 00:42:51.610
The organization always
paid for the plane tickets.

00:42:51.610 --> 00:42:55.170
In the very beginning we had
to pay our own hotel bills.

00:42:55.170 --> 00:42:59.600
And we would always stay
at some real crappy hotel,

00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:02.220
and we would double
and triple up.

00:43:02.220 --> 00:43:05.640
And that changed after
about a, year or two.

00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:08.580
And food, we had to
buy our own food.

00:43:08.580 --> 00:43:10.690
And it wasn't until,
like the last year

00:43:10.690 --> 00:43:15.040
that we got-- in
1976, we got $25 a day

00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:19.260
per diem, which was--
you get a lot for $25.

00:43:19.260 --> 00:43:19.860
Salary.

00:43:19.860 --> 00:43:22.215
How much did the band
members make in those days?

00:43:24.930 --> 00:43:28.590
It depended on seniority.

00:43:28.590 --> 00:43:30.535
CHARLIE SAWYER: How was
it compared to, say,

00:43:30.535 --> 00:43:31.706
what Ray Charles--

00:43:31.706 --> 00:43:33.580
RON LEVY: Nobody knew
what anybody else made.

00:43:33.580 --> 00:43:35.380
You weren't allowed
to talk about that,

00:43:35.380 --> 00:43:38.920
to say-- even your close
friends in the band,

00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:40.829
you couldn't say,
come on, tell me.

00:43:40.829 --> 00:43:41.620
I won't say a word.

00:43:41.620 --> 00:43:43.620
You couldn't do that.

00:43:43.620 --> 00:43:46.050
That was one of the rules
that you couldn't do.

00:43:46.050 --> 00:43:50.830
But when I first
started, it was 1969.

00:43:50.830 --> 00:43:53.180
I was making $250 a week.

00:43:53.180 --> 00:43:59.770
And by 1976, I was
making $750 a week.

00:43:59.770 --> 00:44:06.140
But-- and the next question is--
were your taxes and FICA always

00:44:06.140 --> 00:44:08.190
withheld?

00:44:08.190 --> 00:44:12.550
Yes, they were always
withheld, but the people that

00:44:12.550 --> 00:44:17.180
withheld them always
didn't pay them.

00:44:17.180 --> 00:44:20.140
So for the last year
and a half, two years,

00:44:20.140 --> 00:44:24.010
that I was with the band,
I lived in New York City

00:44:24.010 --> 00:44:29.170
at the time, so my
city tax, my state tax

00:44:29.170 --> 00:44:34.570
and federal tax and FICA
were withdrawn from my pay.

00:44:34.570 --> 00:44:38.550
And it wasn't paid out.

00:44:38.550 --> 00:44:41.000
It wasn't paid for
the proper places.

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:43.040
And I'm not going
to say who took it

00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:46.250
because I don't actually know.

00:44:46.250 --> 00:44:48.550
But it was somebody
who had access to it.

00:44:51.560 --> 00:44:58.670
And the thing was, by the end
of the last, I'd say year,

00:44:58.670 --> 00:44:59.860
that all came out.

00:44:59.860 --> 00:45:03.150
And everybody in the
band got a tax audit.

00:45:03.150 --> 00:45:06.250
So what happened was, every
Sunday night, Sunday night

00:45:06.250 --> 00:45:07.990
was pay night.

00:45:07.990 --> 00:45:13.330
And there was always
an IRS guy there, too.

00:45:13.330 --> 00:45:16.440
So we had to pay all of
our withholding taxes

00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:21.230
for that week, plus the
corresponding week for the year

00:45:21.230 --> 00:45:22.700
before.

00:45:22.700 --> 00:45:27.186
So in other words, probably
like 70% of was our pay

00:45:27.186 --> 00:45:28.280
was taken out.

00:45:28.280 --> 00:45:32.050
So even though I was making
$750, I was only making $200.

00:45:32.050 --> 00:45:34.910
I was only keeping
$200 cash, and that

00:45:34.910 --> 00:45:38.460
was impossible to keep
an apartment in New York

00:45:38.460 --> 00:45:43.470
and my parking for my
car and living expenses

00:45:43.470 --> 00:45:45.454
and this and that, and all that.

00:45:45.454 --> 00:45:46.370
And that's why I left.

00:45:46.370 --> 00:45:48.050
That's one of the reasons why.

00:45:48.050 --> 00:45:50.710
CHARLIE SAWYER: We're kind
of running short on time.

00:45:50.710 --> 00:45:56.910
So I want to skip to three
questions about B.B. King.

00:45:56.910 --> 00:46:00.880
What is your appraisal
of B.B. King, the person?

00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:05.650
RON LEVY: Completely
honorable, class person

00:46:05.650 --> 00:46:09.560
who raised the standards of
professionalism for everybody

00:46:09.560 --> 00:46:12.290
that he came in contact with in.

00:46:12.290 --> 00:46:14.380
This last episode
that I was talking

00:46:14.380 --> 00:46:16.660
about with the
money getting funny,

00:46:16.660 --> 00:46:20.480
all those people were fired as
soon as he found out about it.

00:46:20.480 --> 00:46:24.110
And he tried to help us,
but he was in a bind.

00:46:24.110 --> 00:46:26.740
He was in the same bind we were.

00:46:26.740 --> 00:46:32.060
But B.B. is very shrewd and
very kind-hearted person.

00:46:32.060 --> 00:46:35.790
I would say he's probably one
of the most beloved artists

00:46:35.790 --> 00:46:38.630
that I've ever
seen, by everybody.

00:46:38.630 --> 00:46:42.790
And as you saw in that
little clip that we did,

00:46:42.790 --> 00:46:46.150
in the seven years that I worked
with him and all the years

00:46:46.150 --> 00:46:50.090
since, and the times I
knew him from before,

00:46:50.090 --> 00:46:54.550
I never saw him
pause or even take

00:46:54.550 --> 00:47:01.890
like a 10-second or 20-second,
30-second break in the show.

00:47:01.890 --> 00:47:05.610
You know how sometimes you see
a musician and their playing,

00:47:05.610 --> 00:47:09.350
and then they're kind of
phoning it in for a chorus.

00:47:09.350 --> 00:47:11.200
I never saw him do that, ever.

00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:13.350
All those faces that
you see him make

00:47:13.350 --> 00:47:18.670
and all that intensity
was 100% sincere and real.

00:47:18.670 --> 00:47:26.740
And being next to that every
night and playing next to him

00:47:26.740 --> 00:47:30.980
was an unbelievably educational
experience on many levels.

00:47:30.980 --> 00:47:34.658
CHARLIE SAWYER: Your appraisal
of B.B. King, the musician.

00:47:34.658 --> 00:47:35.830
RON LEVY: The musician.

00:47:35.830 --> 00:47:37.455
Well, that ties
in with all that.

00:47:40.430 --> 00:47:45.080
Look, he's one of the
most influential musicians

00:47:45.080 --> 00:47:47.015
of the century, of
this past century.

00:47:50.950 --> 00:47:57.580
I've said this before,
that there'd only

00:47:57.580 --> 00:48:01.830
be maybe four or five guitar
players in the Rock and Roll

00:48:01.830 --> 00:48:08.420
Hall of Fame if they didn't
make it doing one of B.B. King's

00:48:08.420 --> 00:48:09.860
riffs.

00:48:09.860 --> 00:48:11.790
If they didn't play
one of B.B. King's

00:48:11.790 --> 00:48:13.970
riffs to get over and
be famous, there'd

00:48:13.970 --> 00:48:19.910
be maybe four, five, six guys in
the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

00:48:19.910 --> 00:48:24.070
Maybe Chuck Berry, Bo
Diddley, something like that.

00:48:24.070 --> 00:48:26.550
But Clapton, he
wouldn't be in it.

00:48:26.550 --> 00:48:28.360
Hendrix, he wouldn't be in it.

00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:30.620
You know, all those
guys like that.

00:48:30.620 --> 00:48:33.290
Any of the English guys,
they wouldn't be in it.

00:48:33.290 --> 00:48:35.940
Anybody you can
think of pretty much

00:48:35.940 --> 00:48:39.610
wouldn't be in it if
they were excluded

00:48:39.610 --> 00:48:44.850
from copying Albert King or B.B.
King, getting recognized off

00:48:44.850 --> 00:48:45.710
of that.

00:48:45.710 --> 00:48:46.990
CHARLIE SAWYER: Yes.

00:48:46.990 --> 00:48:49.670
J. Geils' answer to
the same question,

00:48:49.670 --> 00:48:55.580
he said, in this category of
American improvisational music,

00:48:55.580 --> 00:48:57.660
you have a handful
of giants starting

00:48:57.660 --> 00:49:05.420
with Louis Armstrong, Duke
Ellington, Charlie Parker,

00:49:05.420 --> 00:49:08.990
Miles Davis, and B.B. King.

00:49:08.990 --> 00:49:11.070
And he puts him in that--

00:49:11.070 --> 00:49:12.802
RON LEVY: Yeah.

00:49:12.802 --> 00:49:15.160
CHARLIE SAWYER: And
my last question.

00:49:15.160 --> 00:49:18.384
What is B.B.'s legacy?

00:49:18.384 --> 00:49:20.440
RON LEVY: I think
his legacy will

00:49:20.440 --> 00:49:25.070
be that he's one of the most
beloved and honest and sincere

00:49:25.070 --> 00:49:33.830
artists that ever graced
the stage of any generation.

00:49:33.830 --> 00:49:39.890
I've never seen a more
sincere, honest artist.

00:49:39.890 --> 00:49:43.180
When you saw that clip
before, in Africa,

00:49:43.180 --> 00:49:48.360
I mean, here's B.B. Playing
in Kinshasa, Africa,

00:49:48.360 --> 00:49:54.320
in front of 90,000 Zairians.

00:49:54.320 --> 00:49:56.810
The leader of that
country-- granted,

00:49:56.810 --> 00:49:59.180
he was a brutal dictator--
but he was still,

00:49:59.180 --> 00:50:03.630
you know, it's not an
English colony anymore.

00:50:03.630 --> 00:50:09.400
And the intensity and
how he presents himself,

00:50:09.400 --> 00:50:16.170
when you look at that
video, he's not jiving.

00:50:16.170 --> 00:50:17.520
It's not an act.

00:50:17.520 --> 00:50:19.124
It's real.

00:50:19.124 --> 00:50:21.540
So if anything you're going
to say about B.B. King is he's

00:50:21.540 --> 00:50:22.040
real.

00:50:22.040 --> 00:50:23.410
CHARLIE SAWYER: Yes.

00:50:23.410 --> 00:50:26.620
I'll agree and affirm
everything you said

00:50:26.620 --> 00:50:29.450
and add one thing in my opinion.

00:50:29.450 --> 00:50:33.050
100 years from now,
if people still

00:50:33.050 --> 00:50:37.410
listen to blues music, more
than any other one thing,

00:50:37.410 --> 00:50:41.080
it will be B.B. King
who made that possible.

00:50:41.080 --> 00:50:46.670
B.B.'s popularity, his
spreading of this music,

00:50:46.670 --> 00:50:49.280
is what gives the
possibility this

00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:52.500
will not be a kind of
little passing episode,

00:50:52.500 --> 00:50:55.030
oh, the blues, you know,
in the 20th century

00:50:55.030 --> 00:50:57.520
there was a kind of
romance with the blues,

00:50:57.520 --> 00:50:59.340
and then it's a
footnote in history.

00:50:59.340 --> 00:51:04.610
I think that won't happen
because of B.B. King.

00:51:04.610 --> 00:51:06.380
RON LEVY: He was
the total package.

00:51:06.380 --> 00:51:12.130
I mean, unbelievable singer,
innovative guitar player

00:51:12.130 --> 00:51:14.990
that everybody copies.

00:51:14.990 --> 00:51:18.166
Like I said, there's 100 guys
in the Rock and Roll Hall

00:51:18.166 --> 00:51:20.700
of Fame that copied him that
are in there because of him,

00:51:20.700 --> 00:51:25.310
CHARLIE SAWYER: He's almost
89 and he's still on the road.

00:51:25.310 --> 00:51:26.770
He's still out there playing.

00:51:26.770 --> 00:51:28.760
He played at--

00:51:28.760 --> 00:51:30.715
RON LEVY: The stage is his home.

00:51:30.715 --> 00:51:32.700
CHARLIE SAWYER: Yes.

00:51:32.700 --> 00:51:34.400
Then you must come back.

00:51:34.400 --> 00:51:35.260
RON LEVY: Thank you.

00:51:35.260 --> 00:51:35.730
I'd love to.

00:51:35.730 --> 00:51:37.854
CHARLIE SAWYER: We'll come
back and next time we'll

00:51:37.854 --> 00:51:39.320
make some music together.
