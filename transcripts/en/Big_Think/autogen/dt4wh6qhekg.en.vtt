00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.570
so what will our currency be 500 years

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580
so what will our currency be 500 years
 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:04.430
so what will our currency be 500 years
from now I like to think that we might

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440
from now I like to think that we might
 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.039
from now I like to think that we might
be space tourists right and space travel

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049
be space tourists right and space travel
 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.320
be space tourists right and space travel
is going well and what will we use as

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330
is going well and what will we use as
 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.620
is going well and what will we use as
currency in space well you know if we do

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630
currency in space well you know if we do
 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.390
currency in space well you know if we do
a transaction in space the distances are

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400
a transaction in space the distances are
 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.700
a transaction in space the distances are
quite far so if you're on one planet and

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710
quite far so if you're on one planet and
 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:17.870
quite far so if you're on one planet and
I'm on another planet we do a

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880
I'm on another planet we do a
 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.029
I'm on another planet we do a
transaction considering the theory of

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039
transaction considering the theory of
 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.800
transaction considering the theory of
relativity like how do you calculate

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810
relativity like how do you calculate
 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.779
relativity like how do you calculate
interest rates and when time is relative

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789
interest rates and when time is relative
 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.700
interest rates and when time is relative
what do you put that clock to calculate

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710
what do you put that clock to calculate
 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.200
what do you put that clock to calculate
interest rates you would have to build

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210
interest rates you would have to build
 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.849
interest rates you would have to build
arguably a distributed network

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859
arguably a distributed network
 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.980
arguably a distributed network
throughout the galaxy right so that when

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990
throughout the galaxy right so that when
 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.930
throughout the galaxy right so that when
you're doing the transactions you could

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940
you're doing the transactions you could
 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.639
you're doing the transactions you could
basically be calling on information

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649
basically be calling on information
 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.979
basically be calling on information
systems throughout different moons and

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989
systems throughout different moons and
 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.020
systems throughout different moons and
different planets it may be that we have

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030
different planets it may be that we have
 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.110
different planets it may be that we have
to have a find a new rare metal to use

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120
to have a find a new rare metal to use
 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.400
to have a find a new rare metal to use
as a currency like what are the use of

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410
as a currency like what are the use of
 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.959
as a currency like what are the use of
star wars they use something called the

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969
star wars they use something called the
 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.880
star wars they use something called the
intergalactic banking unit or the credit

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890
intergalactic banking unit or the credit
 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.430
intergalactic banking unit or the credit
and that was based on a rare metal so it

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440
and that was based on a rare metal so it
 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.529
and that was based on a rare metal so it
might be that as we start to see space

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539
might be that as we start to see space
 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.020
might be that as we start to see space
tours and tourism we have to use some

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030
tours and tourism we have to use some
 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.279
tours and tourism we have to use some
kind of new metals that we find the

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289
kind of new metals that we find the
 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:56.810
kind of new metals that we find the
galaxy we might have had to build a

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820
galaxy we might have had to build a
 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:57.920
galaxy we might have had to build a
distributed network throughout the

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930
distributed network throughout the
 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.510
distributed network throughout the
galaxy so we can verify local

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520
galaxy so we can verify local
 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.209
galaxy so we can verify local
transactions and even here in America or

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219
transactions and even here in America or
 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.820
transactions and even here in America or
in the world in the earth we might be

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830
in the world in the earth we might be
 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.920
in the world in the earth we might be
building systems or it's like an energy

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930
building systems or it's like an energy
 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.500
building systems or it's like an energy
grid we're all plugged into the same

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510
grid we're all plugged into the same
 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.480
grid we're all plugged into the same
grid and we're trading vitamin B and

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490
grid and we're trading vitamin B and
 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.179
grid and we're trading vitamin B and
calories and we are rebalancing our

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189
calories and we are rebalancing our
 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.740
calories and we are rebalancing our
energy because if you look throughout

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750
energy because if you look throughout
 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.899
energy because if you look throughout
the natural world energy is the currency

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909
the natural world energy is the currency
 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.149
the natural world energy is the currency
of the natural world the further we get

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159
of the natural world the further we get
 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.340
of the natural world the further we get
into the future maybe money may remain

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350
into the future maybe money may remain
 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.740
into the future maybe money may remain
the same and remain remain as energy

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750
the same and remain remain as energy
 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.660
the same and remain remain as energy
it's not so crazy to look at science

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670
it's not so crazy to look at science
 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.910
it's not so crazy to look at science
fiction and in fact the first time the

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920
fiction and in fact the first time the
 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.190
fiction and in fact the first time the
credit card was ever mentioned was in a

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200
credit card was ever mentioned was in a
 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.030
credit card was ever mentioned was in a
book in 1887 called looking backwards by

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040
book in 1887 called looking backwards by
 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.740
book in 1887 called looking backwards by
a man named Edward Bellamy it's about

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750
a man named Edward Bellamy it's about
 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.630
a man named Edward Bellamy it's about
this guy who falls asleep wakes up in

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640
this guy who falls asleep wakes up in
 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.460
this guy who falls asleep wakes up in
the year 2000 and what does he see he

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470
the year 2000 and what does he see he
 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.770
the year 2000 and what does he see he
sees the government creating credit

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780
sees the government creating credit
 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.840
sees the government creating credit
cards for their citizens and the

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850
cards for their citizens and the
 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.490
cards for their citizens and the
government issues money on these credit

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500
government issues money on these credit
 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.460
government issues money on these credit
cards and so on or with socialist utopia

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470
cards and so on or with socialist utopia
 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.260
cards and so on or with socialist utopia
but if you look to the future you can

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270
but if you look to the future you can
 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.550
but if you look to the future you can
look at what economists say about the

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560
look at what economists say about the
 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.050
look at what economists say about the
future but I like to think about what

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060
future but I like to think about what
 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.310
future but I like to think about what
are the science fiction people saying

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320
are the science fiction people saying
 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.959
are the science fiction people saying
about the future what is the idea of

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969
about the future what is the idea of
 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.300
about the future what is the idea of
money in the future and so some science

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310
money in the future and so some science
 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.649
money in the future and so some science
fiction writers say well maybe in the

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659
fiction writers say well maybe in the
 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.289
fiction writers say well maybe in the
future if you can have a pacemaker

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299
future if you can have a pacemaker
 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.209
future if you can have a pacemaker
embedded into your body why not a

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219
embedded into your body why not a
 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:06.800
embedded into your body why not a
payment device right so you just wave

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810
payment device right so you just wave
 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.719
payment device right so you just wave
your hand over a payment reader what

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729
your hand over a payment reader what
 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.059
your hand over a payment reader what
about a reputation ship where you walk

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069
about a reputation ship where you walk
 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.309
about a reputation ship where you walk
in to a store and everyone knows your
