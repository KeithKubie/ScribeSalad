JOANNA SMITH: Hello everybody,
and welcome back to Google+

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:12.520
Developers Live.

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.900
I'm Joanna Smith, and I'm a
developer programs engineer

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:15.665
for Google+.

00:00:15.665 --> 00:00:19.320
And today I have our fantastic
intern Sam Stern, who wrote

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.790
the documentation we published
this morning at

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:26.690
developers.googl
e.com/+/web/facebook.

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:30.305
And what we wrote here is an
article on how to add Google+

00:00:30.305 --> 00:00:32.930
to an existing Facebook
integration.

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.160
So Sam, why don't you tell
us about your project.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.330
SAM STERN: Thanks, Joanna.

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:39.000
So the idea of my project is
that we have a lot of great

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.860
resources on our developers site
for how to get started

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.730
with Google+ if it's your
first identity provider.

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.490
But where there was a gap was
what if Google+ is not your

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:48.590
first identity provider, and
specifically, what if you

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.530
already have Facebook integrated
into your website?

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.640
How can you get started with
Google+, and overcome the

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.040
unique challenges that you run
into when Google+ is your

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.090
second or third identity
provider?

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.060
JOANNA SMITH: So how did you,
as an intern, gain this

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:06.410
perspective and come to
understand this point of view?

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:09.790
SAM STERN: So the easiest way
to pretend to be a Facebook

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:11.980
developer with Facebook
integrated into their app is

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:13.700
to build an app with Facebook
integration.

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.400
Which is what I spent my first
few weeks here doing.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.310
And from there, I went to add
Google+ on top, making note of

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.780
what was easy, what was hard,
or just what was different

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.450
that might be interesting to a
developer going through the

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.100
same experience.

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.600
JOANNA SMITH: OK.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.010
So I guess the next logical
question is,

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.830
what did you learn?

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:29.610
What was different?

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:30.290
What was easy?

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.030
What was hard?

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:33.160
SAM STERN: There are three main
things you have to do.

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:34.980
The first thing is you
have to get started.

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:38.010
You have to add the Google+
JavaScript to your web page.

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:39.390
You've got to get the sign
in button on your page.

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.466
And some basic things that are
a little bit different from

00:01:41.466 --> 00:01:44.100
the perspective of a
Facebook developer.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.380
From there, there are a couple
pain points that you're going

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.510
to want to tackle, such as
authentication on the server

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:50.900
side, and on the client side.

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:54.460
And after that, it goes into
translating features.

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.310
If you're sharing on Facebook,
how do you share on Google+?

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.700
And beyond that, what can you
do that's unique to Google+,

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.870
and how can you really make the
user experience better by

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:03.440
adding Google?

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:04.470
JOANNA SMITH: So it sounds
like there's a

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:05.820
lot of content there.

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.370
But let's break it down,
and let's talk about

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:08.539
authentication.

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.190
What did you learn about
managing multiple identity

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.740
providers across multiple
platforms?

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.580
SAM STERN: So the first thing
I did with authentication--

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.805
I tried to jump right in,
and the code got messy.

00:02:18.805 --> 00:02:20.160
And what I learned quickly
is you have to

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.210
separate your concerns.

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:23.720
You want to keep your Google+
code in one place, your

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.160
Facebook code in
another place.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.380
And the code that holds it all
together is what you should

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:29.130
really focus on.

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.420
That's where you should manage
your authorization.

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.150
So in the article I'll show an
example of how you can do this

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.270
with your client side login on
a page that has the sign in

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.730
with Google button, and the log
in with Facebook button.

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.550
And we can go to the code now.

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.830
I'll give an overview of the
code here, but make sure to

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.280
look at the article after
the episode and

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.840
take a deeper look.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.420
So what you can see here is
something that, in this case,

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:53.580
is called AuthStates.

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.550
And it's a central place to
manage authorization.

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:00.210
You can see on the screen the
code for when the user clicks

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:01.870
on log in with Facebook
button.

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.370
What you would normally do, is
initiate the login process

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:06.750
right in that block of code.

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.000
But when you're dealing with
multiple providers, it's

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.170
easier to offload your
authorization state to this

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.670
[INAUDIBLE] code that we've
written here and centralize

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.070
your choice of log in.

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:23.150
So for instance, in this case,
we want to let the user make a

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.440
choice between Google
and Facebook when

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:26.550
they're signing in.

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:28.670
But we also want to keep
the flow going quickly.

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:32.780
So the code here gives an
example of what you'd do if

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.730
the user is logged into
Google and Facebook.

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:36.795
In this case, we're going to go
ahead and log the user in

00:03:36.795 --> 00:03:37.130
with Google.

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:40.280
Of course, you can customize
this to your preferences.

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.320
But what you can really see
here, and what the point is,

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:46.550
that none of the authorization
logic is mixed together.

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:47.970
And you don't have any
of these nasty

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.940
if-Google-else-Facebook
statements.

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:52.500
You centralize it, and then you
can go on to add three,

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:57.750
four identity providers and push
all the authentication to

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:58.720
this one central location.

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.360
Instead of creating messy code
that's hard to maintain.

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:02.035
JOANNA SMITH: OK.

00:04:02.035 --> 00:04:05.620
And so when you were creating
this central location, this

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.470
glue that holds everything
together, was there anything

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.810
about it that was particularly
difficult?

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:12.800
Or did you find that it started
to make sense once you

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.360
really had your mind
around it?

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:15.860
SAM STERN: So I think
you'll see--

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:18.910
once you implement a framework
like this--

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.040
that it all starts to make sense
when you think of your

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:25.790
providers as just ways a user
can connect to your website.

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:29.360
And don't try to let the
providers handle

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:30.150
each other's logic.

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.110
If you centralize it, you'll see
that you can take the flow

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.555
you had in your mind and really
implement it quickly in

00:04:36.555 --> 00:04:37.310
your application.

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.900
And then you won't have to
maintain the same separate

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:41.340
pieces of code over an over.

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:42.785
You can do it all
in one place.

00:04:42.785 --> 00:04:43.120
JOANNA SMITH: OK.

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.380
Social identity providers have
a lot more than just

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:46.730
authentication, right?

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:49.570
And I guess my next question
is, how do some of these

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:51.620
features that are really similar
between Facebook and

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:54.050
Google+-- how did
you handle that?

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:56.510
SAM STERN: So in the feature
translation section of the

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:59.620
article, you'll see a breakdown
of if you're doing

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.290
something with Facebook, how you
can do the same thing or

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:04.280
similar thing on Google+
to keep it a consistent

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.060
experience for users.

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:08.160
One particular example is, if
you're used to publishing

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.370
information on the open graph
on Facebook, you should be

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:12.950
publishing app activities
to Google.

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:15.420
Which is Google's way of sharing
structured data from

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:18.810
your application about actions
the user has taken.

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:21.660
A user has listened to a
song, or rented a room.

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:24.380
Things like that that you might
have been pushing-- the

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:27.830
open graph you should push to
app activities on Google.

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:28.130
JOANNA SMITH: OK.

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:32.620
And then how did you handle
the user experience across

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:34.470
multiple different
feature sets?

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:35.570
Did you have custom UIs?

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:38.350
Did you surface certain buttons
at certain times?

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:40.480
How did you really
handle that?

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:43.010
SAM STERN: So what the developer
really should focus

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:45.530
on is making your app shine.

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:48.290
But also highlighting the
identity provider that your

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:49.080
user chose.

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.380
So you want to present the
correct set of features at any

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:54.350
given time based on how the
user's signed in to your

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:59.230
application, without creating a
fragmented user experience.

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:02.940
For instance, if the user is on
a page that is sharable on

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:04.970
Facebook, you might want to have
Facebook's share button.

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:06.570
Whereas with Google, you
might want to have

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:07.570
an interactive post.

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:10.370
And this is something that you
can also discover in the

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:13.970
feature translation section,
about how to give a consistent

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:19.380
user experience without missing

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:20.960
what makes each network--

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:23.060
each social identity provider--
different.

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:24.430
Or why the user chose
to sign in with the

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:25.880
provider that they did.

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:26.120
JOANNA SMITH: OK.

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:29.350
And on that note, what are some
things that are different

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:32.020
about Google+ that you think
Facebook developers might be

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:33.100
interested in?

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:36.350
SAM STERN: So there were three
main things that I was able to

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:39.190
add to my application after I
[INAUDIBLE] with Google that I

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:40.380
couldn't get before.

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:42.190
The first thing was over the
air installs, which is

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:43.240
something really powerful--

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:46.040
that if you have a user sign in
on the web, you can offer

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:47.450
them the opportunity
to sign in--

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:50.020
to install your Android
application to their device at

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:50.810
the same time.

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:53.490
When a user signs in to your
service once, they're signed

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:54.540
in on all their devices.

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:56.900
And this is a way to create a
really great user experience,

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:59.505
and get users to where they
actually want to be going in

00:06:59.505 --> 00:07:01.040
your application.

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:03.940
And the third one is interactive
posts, which at

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:06.310
first might seem like a
share that a lot of

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:07.340
other providers have.

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:09.245
Interactive posts allow you to
really call the user to an

00:07:09.245 --> 00:07:10.940
action on your application.

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:14.840
And this also goes with deep
linking, where you can bring

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:17.460
the user directly to what they
want to do on your app or on

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:18.400
your website.

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.480
Rather than just sharing
content, which is more

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:24.500
powerful and allows the user
to act more quickly.

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:25.290
JOANNA SMITH: Fantastic.

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:28.110
So let's go back to this article
that you wrote, right?

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:29.270
It seems to be pretty long.

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:30.200
There's a lot in there.

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:32.910
What can developers expect to
learn from this article?

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:35.060
What resources are available
to them there?

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:37.020
SAM STERN: So like you said,
there's a lot of content in

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:37.520
this article.

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:40.130
And hopefully what a developer
can see is that is a very

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:43.400
customizable framework for
managing multiple providers in

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:45.540
your application.

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:47.140
There's a lot of code here that
will work for you, but it

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:48.110
doesn't have to be
set in stone.

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:51.910
You can expand what's in the
article to fit the needs of

00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:52.330
your application.

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:54.400
And hopefully you can go
from zero to hero with

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:55.740
Google+ very quickly.

00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:57.655
And start from having just
Facebook on your website, to

00:07:57.655 --> 00:08:00.396
have a fully functioning Google+
integration by the end

00:08:00.396 --> 00:08:01.640
of the article.

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:04.110
JOANNA SMITH: So before we go,
before we sign off, I want to

00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:04.850
put you on the spot.

00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:07.020
And I want to know your favorite
part about interning

00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:09.300
with us here in Mountain View
was, as well as your least

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:10.440
favorite part.

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:12.250
SAM STERN: So favorite
part is easy.

00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:14.650
I sit about five feet from a
Foosball table, and I got

00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:16.880
pretty good at Foosball playing
with everybody.

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:18.680
And I'm going to cheat and
have two favorite parts.

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:20.716
I also really like the food,
which I think everybody who

00:08:20.716 --> 00:08:23.170
comes to Mountain View says.

00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:24.930
And my least favorite part,
coming from the East coast,

00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:27.290
would be the tech bubble
of the Silicon Valley.

00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:29.990
It's hard to go anywhere
within 50 miles without

00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:31.760
hearing about the latest
app or website.

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:33.813
Which sometimes it can
be a little much.

00:08:33.813 --> 00:08:35.880
JOANNA SMITH: That's a
very true statement.

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:38.130
Well, thank you so much for
joining us today, Sam.

00:08:38.130 --> 00:08:40.360
We really appreciated you taking
the time to do this

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:42.130
episode before you go
back to school.

00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:44.650
And once again, everyone
watching at home, if you'd

00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:47.160
like to see the full scope of
what Sam did this summer, you

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:52.460
can go to developers.googl
e.com/+/web/facebook.

00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:53.360
And of course, all of our

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:55.400
documentation is there as well.

00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:57.670
And you can learn everything you
wanted to know about the

00:08:57.670 --> 00:08:59.820
Google+ platform, or how to
get started if you're a

00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:02.120
Facebook developer primarily.

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:04.270
And then of course, if you have
questions about this, ask

00:09:04.270 --> 00:09:04.680
them to us.

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:05.380
We'll answer.

00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:08.390
On Stack Overflow, if you use
the tag Google-+, we'll be

00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:09.770
able to find it.

00:09:09.770 --> 00:09:12.500
And then if you'd like to see
some code of how our samples

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:14.615
work, or how to sign in, or how
the button works, check

00:09:14.615 --> 00:09:18.130
out our GitHub repository
at github.com/google+.

00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:20.010
And then if you find a bug, or
if you have a feature request,

00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:21.200
let us know in our
issue tracker.

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:23.455
And all of these resources are
available in our documentation

00:09:23.455 --> 00:09:26.220
at developers.google.com/+.

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:27.990
So thank you for joining, and
I hope you all have a

00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:29.240
wonderful week.
