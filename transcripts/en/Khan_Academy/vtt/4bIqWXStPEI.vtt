00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:02.400
Problem 41.

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.940
Use the histogram below
to answer the

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:06.350
question that follows.

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:07.790
Here's our histogram.

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:10.470
Two six-sided number cubes.

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:13.590
They sound suspiciously
like regular dice.

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.500
Two six-sided number
cubes are rolled

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.420
simultaneously 10 times.

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.600
So it's like you're rolling
two dice 10 times.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.000
The sums are recorded in the
histogram shown above.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.670
So when you look at what's on
top of your dice, and you add

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.910
them up, and then they recorded
the frequency of the

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.119
different sums. Which of the
following statements can be

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:34.190
inferred from the histogram?

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.050
So the first one says the
mean is less than

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:37.930
the median by 1/10.

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:39.740
The mean-- OK, so they're
comparing the mean and the

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:41.870
median in every one
of these choices.

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.240
So we can actually look at this
histogram and figure out

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.720
all of the results
that happened.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.830
So the sum, we got
3 three times.

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:53.150
So we got three 3's, 3, 3, 3.

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.400
We got one 4.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.840
We got three 5's, right?

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.140
5 had a frequency of
3, so 5, 5, 5.

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.019
And then we had no 6's.

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:09.150
And then we had three
7's, 7, 7, 7.

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.790
So the median is easy
to figure out.

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.840
The median is literally just
the middle number.

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:14.710
So how many do we have here?

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:20.830
We have 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.400
So the middle number is going--
or the middle two

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.160
numbers, because it's an even,
and if they're not the same

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:27.370
number, we're going to have
to take the average.

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:29.200
So what's the middle number?

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.310
If we have 4 on this side, and
4 on this side, the middle

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.720
numbers-- right, because we have
an even data center, 5.

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.770
So the median here
is equal to 5.

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:43.790
Now, the mean is going to take
a little bit of more

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:44.470
mathematics.

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.230
We're going to have to sum up
all of our results, and then

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:50.880
divide by the total of data
points there are.

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.590
Well, actually I should have
known that there are 10 data

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.040
points, we're going
to divide by 10.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.330
So what's the sum?

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:56.930
It's 3 times 3.

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:05.180
So this is 9 plus 4, plus 5
times 3-- you have 5 times 3

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.919
here, which is 15-- plus
7 times 3, which is 21.

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:15.460
So 9 plus 4 is 13,
plus 15, plus 21.

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:20.070
This is 13 plus 15
is 28, plus 21.

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.910
28 plus 21 is 49.

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:27.770
And if we have to divide that by
10, we get an average-- so

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:29.940
if you divide it by 10, because
we have 10 data

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.320
points, the average is going
to be equal to 4.9.

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.965
So our average is 4.9
Our median is 5.

00:02:36.965 --> 00:02:41.600
So our average is 1/10
less than our median.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.740
Or when I say average,
I should say mean.

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.440
But it tends to mean, you know,
when people say average,

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.190
they tend to mean the mean.

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.430
Our mean, where we just added
up all the data points and

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.930
divided by 10, is 1/10
less than the median.

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.660
So let's see, the mean is less
than the median by 1/10.

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:59.620
That looks right.

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.270
Our mean is less than
the median by 1/10.

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:06.660
Choice A.

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.580
Problem 42.

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.670
Use the graph below to answer
the question that follows.

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.250
Distribution of test scores.

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:15.680
All right.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.670
The graph above shows the
distribution of scores on a

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:25.570
test with possible scores of
10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60.

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:27.040
Those are the only
possible scores.

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.100
Maybe there were only six
questions on the exam.

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:31.640
Well, yeah, sure.

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.870
The minimum passing
score was 40.

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.590
So this is the minimum
passing score.

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.310
You have to get at least
a 40 to pass.

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:43.110
20 girls and 20 boys took the
test. The percentage of girls

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:45.870
passing the test was how much
greater than the percentage of

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.680
boys passing the test?

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:48.190
All right.

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:51.500
So let's see how many girls
passed the test. So this

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.200
dotted graph is the girls.

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.350
So 5 got a 40, so
those passed.

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:58.960
They just barely passed.

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:01.240
So you had those 5
girls get a 40.

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:04.360
Then you had another
6 girls get a 50.

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.540
So you have another 6 girls get
a 50, and you had another

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.220
4 girls get a 60, plus 4.

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:11.720
So that's how many
girls passed.

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:20.950
So that's 5 plus 6 is 11, plus
4 is 15 girls passed.

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:26.070
There were a total of 20 girls,
so 15 out of 20, or,

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:27.800
you could think of
that as 75%.

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:34.030
If you divide 15 by 20, that's
the same thing as 3/4, or 75%

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:35.290
of girls passed.

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:36.430
Now let's do the boys.

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:37.880
And I'll do it in stereotypical

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.440
colors, the boys in blue.

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:45.160
Once again, they have to get
at least a 40 to pass.

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:50.630
So 6 boys just barely
passed, got the 40.

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:54.590
Then 3 boys got a 50.

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:55.800
They passed.

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:59.440
Plus 2 boys got a
60, they passed.

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:03.630
So total of 6 plus 3, plus
2 is 11 boys passed.

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:07.660
11 out of 20 is the same
thing as what?

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:09.030
That's 55%.

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:11.300
If you multiply the numerator
and the denominator by 5, you

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.820
get 55 over 100.

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:19.050
So this is equal to 55%
of the boys passed.

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:19.970
Now, what did they ask us?

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:21.110
I forgot already.

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:24.200
The percentage of girls passing
the test was how much

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.390
greater than the percentage
of boys passing the test?

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:29.900
So 75% is how much
greater than 55%?

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:35.250
Well 75% minus 55%,
that's 20%.

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:38.550
The girls' percentage is 20%
larger than the boys'

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:39.800
percentage.

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:45.430
The percentage of girls passing
the test was how much

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:48.820
greater than the percentage of
boys passing the test. Right.

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:51.040
It's 20 percentage
points greater.

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:54.070
Next question.

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:56.030
43.

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:58.600
Use the table below to answer
the question-- oh, I think

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:00.010
I've learned that.

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:02.550
A marketing company conducted
a survey to determine

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:05.560
milkshake flavor preferences
among five

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:06.390
different age groups.

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:08.020
These are the different
age groups.

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:11.270
This is the different options,
I guess, on milkshakes.

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:13.420
Based on the data in the table,
what is the probability

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:16.910
that a randomly chosen
35-year-old customer will

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:19.770
prefer a strawberry-flavored
milkshake?

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:23.765
So a randomly chosen
35-year-old, that puts us in

00:06:23.765 --> 00:06:27.430
this bucket, right here,
30- to 39-year-olds.

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:32.780
So if they can be described by
the data that we've collected

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:36.810
already, the probability is
the same ratio of the data

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:39.265
sample we've collected that
actually liked-- what was

00:06:39.265 --> 00:06:40.780
it?-- strawberry-flavored
milkshakes.

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:44.130
So in that age group, how many
total people did we survey?

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:52.210
We surveyed 8 plus 14 is 22.

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:56.340
22 plus 12 is 34.

00:06:56.340 --> 00:07:00.540
We surveyed 34 people in this
age group, and how many of

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:02.590
them liked strawberry
milkshakes?

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:03.650
Well 12 of them did.

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:09.730
12 out of 34 30- to 39-year-olds
liked strawberry

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:10.880
milkshakes.

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:14.460
So, the probability, if we use
that as our data, that a

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:17.690
random 30- to 39-year-old will
like strawberry milkshakes is

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:22.505
12 over 34, or if we reduce
this, that's 6 over 17.

00:07:22.505 --> 00:07:25.790
Just divide the numerator and
the denominator by 2.

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:27.330
And that is D.

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:30.630
Good thing that that was one
of the answer choices, D.

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:35.350
Problem 44.

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:40.600
A child has a set of blocks,
4 of which are square.

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:43.980
5 are round.

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:47.340
And 6 are triangular.

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:50.030
The child randomly picks a block
from the set and gives

00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:51.250
it to his sister.

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:54.100
The child then randomly picks
one more block, so he didn't

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:55.230
put that block back in.

00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:57.770
That's very important--
that first block.

00:07:57.770 --> 00:08:03.490
What is the probability that the
first block was round and

00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:05.920
the second block
was triangular?

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:07.650
So the probability the
first block is round.

00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:10.180
How may total blocks do we
have to start off with?

00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:11.480
We have 15, right?

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:14.260
4 plus 6 is 10, plus 5 is 15.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.890
So we started off
with 15 blocks.

00:08:16.890 --> 00:08:19.440
And what is the probability that
the first block is round?

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:22.780
Well 5 of them are round,
so there's a 5 over 15

00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:23.920
probability.

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:29.610
So this is the probability
that first is

00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:32.130
round, right there.

00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:34.419
And now, what is the probably
that the second block is

00:08:34.419 --> 00:08:35.340
triangular?

00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:39.780
Now, remember, we no longer have
15 blocks in the pile.

00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:41.730
Now, he's taken one
of the blocks and

00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:42.659
given it to his sister.

00:08:42.659 --> 00:08:47.400
So now we're choosing
out of 14 blocks.

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:50.690
And we're also-- and this is an
and-- so we're assuming--

00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:52.770
so what is the probability
that the second block is

00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:56.810
triangular given that the first
block was a circle?

00:08:56.810 --> 00:09:00.520
So we assume that we still have
our full contingency of 6

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:03.800
triangles there, that that
wasn't picked our first time.

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:07.430
So the probability that the
second block is triangular--

00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:11.560
there are 6 triangles, there are
6 triangles out of the 14

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:12.730
blocks left.

00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:15.340
So our answer is going to be 5
over 15, which is the same

00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:21.450
thing as 1/3, times 6 over 14 is
the same thing as 3 over 7,

00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:24.870
which is the same thing
as 1 over 7.

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:28.780
And that is choice C.

00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:31.710
Problem 45.

00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:33.940
Use the spinner below
to answer the

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:35.180
question that follows.

00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:37.200
OK, there's our spinner.

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:40.560
The host of a party tells her
guests that every time the

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:45.350
spinner above lands on the
section labeled fruit basket--

00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:48.420
that's the section labeled fruit
basket-- a guest will

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:51.440
win a large basket of fruit.

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:56.260
If the 180 guests at the party
each spin the spinner once,

00:09:56.260 --> 00:10:00.290
what is the best estimate of
the number of fruit baskets

00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:03.100
that the host will
be giving away?

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:06.230
So let's see, we have,
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:09.005
They look about equal, so
you have 5 equal pies.

00:10:09.005 --> 00:10:13.330
So it looks like there's a 0.2,
or 20% chance, of getting

00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:14.130
fruit baskets.

00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:18.110
So each person can almost
pretend like they get 0.2 of a

00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:19.260
fruit basket.

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:22.460
So they have 0.2, or maybe I'd
say they have a 1/5 chance,

00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:25.620
and then you have 180 of those
people, so times 180.

00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:27.660
I could have multiplied
this times 180.

00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:30.550
This would be the expected
value, the expected number of

00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:32.750
fruit baskets I'm going
to give away.

00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:34.820
So what's 1/5 times 180?

00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:37.360
Or well, how many times
does 5 go into 180?

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:39.980
5 goes into 18 three times.

00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:41.910
3 times 5 is 15.

00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:43.680
18 minus 15 is 3.

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:45.960
30, 36 times.

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:52.400
So I would expect to give
away 36 baskets.
