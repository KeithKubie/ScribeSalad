1
00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:01.593
Okay.

2
00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.460
<v 1>Hey, what's going on? It's Bill Burr and it's time for the Thursday afternoon.</v>

3
00:00:05.461 --> 00:00:09.050
Just before Friday. Monday morning podcast and

4
00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.440
<v 2>ahhh</v>

5
00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.260
<v 1>checking in on. Yeah. I'm just checking in on you. How are you?</v>

6
00:00:16.261 --> 00:00:20.310
How's your week going? I hope you're, uh, I hope you're accomplishing things.

7
00:00:20.311 --> 00:00:24.000
I hope you have a sense of purpose. I hope that, uh, that

8
00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:30.270
<v 0>Douche with the bad breath and the fucking terminal head cold,</v>

9
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.660
that current doesn't walk by your cubicle today.

10
00:00:33.661 --> 00:00:38.220
You know him fucking coming down the fucking hall.

11
00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.280
Um, anyways, I am in a a, I'm in a great mood. Believe it or not, I just,

12
00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.460
uh, I finally got, did I tell you guys just saying, you know,

13
00:00:47.461 --> 00:00:48.570
I was trying to take the, uh,

14
00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:53.400
the old timey door locks out of my old timey doors and my old timey fucking

15
00:00:53.401 --> 00:00:55.830
house, which by the way,

16
00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.990
I had an architect come over here. I was going to do it right this time,

17
00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:01.711
you know,

18
00:01:01.711 --> 00:01:04.590
for the whole fucking idea that I was going to have to make a drum room in my

19
00:01:04.591 --> 00:01:07.590
garage or whatever. And, you know, the whole thing went to shit.

20
00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.490
And I'm not going to tell you why cause I don't need the fucking hassle man.

21
00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.720
But I just, I found out the fucking history of this house and, um,

22
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.500
you know, I, I didn't want to get into it.

23
00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:27.990
Tony, you want to get into it? Suggest you know, fuck it. Just forget it.

24
00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:32.420
<v 1>I had a dream and it went in the shitter.</v>

25
00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.520
<v 0>Um, is it, I swear to God I'm, I'm,</v>

26
00:01:37.521 --> 00:01:40.820
I'm in with this fucking house. There's no turn it back. So anyways, I'm just,

27
00:01:40.821 --> 00:01:44.690
I'm just putting my head down and I'm fixing every fucking goddamn thing in this

28
00:01:44.691 --> 00:01:48.710
fucking house that was painted over Jerry rigged.

29
00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.510
Not done with the fucking,

30
00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:55.460
I don't know who a fucking mailman built half this fucking house. So anyways,

31
00:01:55.461 --> 00:01:56.510
I got these, uh,

32
00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:01.540
these old door locks and of course some dos paid this other Douche to come in

33
00:02:01.761 --> 00:02:05.990
here and he just painted over everything was, she did okay.

34
00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.600
I don't really branded as sexist here. Okay.

35
00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.130
A woman is just as good with the paintbrush as a man is, if not better.

36
00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.250
There are certain studies on a scratch my twat.com that actually indicate that a

37
00:02:19.551 --> 00:02:23.780
female. Um, so I finally got the, uh,

38
00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:25.333
I finally got the door,

39
00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.670
looks out of my door and I brought him down to the old fella down the street,

40
00:02:28.671 --> 00:02:31.520
the locksmith guy. And I gave him three,

41
00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:33.590
two of which were original and none what?

42
00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.740
And another one was a newer like home depot style one. So he goes,

43
00:02:36.741 --> 00:02:39.090
this new home depot, when I can't make a skeleton key four,

44
00:02:39.091 --> 00:02:40.340
it's a big fucking pain in the ass.

45
00:02:40.341 --> 00:02:45.341
I think I have an older lock from the same era is your other lock.

46
00:02:45.521 --> 00:02:48.110
So I said, well, okay, let's do that. And I was like, all right,

47
00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.310
you'll give me a shout when you, when you get these things done. And I said,

48
00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.360
you know, preferably one key would be able to match all of them,

49
00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.730
like a skeleton key and can I also get one those cool looking skeleton keys

50
00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:03.820
instead of some modern looking key? And he goes, oh, absolutely. He goes,

51
00:03:03.821 --> 00:03:05.080
that's the only key that'll work.

52
00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.610
And guess who fucking called me right before I sat down two days later,

53
00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.140
two days later, this guy called back. He has the locks fixed and all that shit.

54
00:03:14.141 --> 00:03:18.700
So now in my office there's a,

55
00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.620
you know, I've got two little closets.

56
00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.040
I can lock both those doors and I can lock the main door. And then the,

57
00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.900
when you go into the bathroom, um, you can,

58
00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:33.910
uh, that one I had fixed last year, so they'll all fucking work. You know,

59
00:03:33.911 --> 00:03:37.600
anyone I love about it is Nia was giving me shit going like,

60
00:03:37.601 --> 00:03:40.750
what the fuck are you pulling all the doors apart? You know?

61
00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:44.470
And I tried to tell her, and she just kept going, Yo, not a lock. Smith

62
00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.220
just kept giving me shit going, you're going to fuck up the house. I go, no,

63
00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:53.670
and I'm gonna do it. She kept going, Yo, not a locksmith. Um,

64
00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.490
and then just was openly laughing at me, um,

65
00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:01.120
as she does, which of course made me laugh at myself,

66
00:04:01.121 --> 00:04:05.680
but I got these fuckers out, um, by,

67
00:04:05.681 --> 00:04:06.161
of course,

68
00:04:06.161 --> 00:04:10.690
going on youtube and learning how to like get these things off without stripping

69
00:04:10.691 --> 00:04:13.720
the, uh, the screws and all that.

70
00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:16.540
I found this great youtube video where this guy goes, all right,

71
00:04:16.541 --> 00:04:20.380
you just stick the screwdriver in there and you give just a little bit of

72
00:04:20.381 --> 00:04:24.760
pressure and then you just sort of tap it lightly with the hammer, you know,

73
00:04:24.761 --> 00:04:28.030
and that loosens up the paint and then eventually you're able to turn the thing

74
00:04:28.031 --> 00:04:29.350
and God damn it, if it didn't work,

75
00:04:29.351 --> 00:04:32.710
it worked on all of them except the ones that I stripped from being to fucking

76
00:04:32.711 --> 00:04:37.120
in patients. So I have a bit of a problem on a couple of doors. But anyways, um,

77
00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.670
I got three of them down in this room and I got about another five to go.

78
00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:47.500
And then unfortunately I, there's another couple of doors that, um,

79
00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:51.390
you know, were replaced with those awful home depot ones.

80
00:04:51.391 --> 00:04:53.410
So I'd like to get some new ones. And I know what you're thinking,

81
00:04:53.411 --> 00:04:55.720
like Jesus Christ. But what's with all the doors in your house?

82
00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:59.590
Old houses had a lot of doors, not a lot of square footage,

83
00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:03.370
not a lot of big closets or anything, but the, God damn it,

84
00:05:03.371 --> 00:05:04.720
they had a lot of doors.

85
00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:09.490
And despite the fact that everybody back then seemed to own maybe one suit that

86
00:05:09.491 --> 00:05:13.960
you got married in and you know, buried your friends in and all of that shit.

87
00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:18.990
Like for some reason they had an unbelievable urge to lock things up.

88
00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:24.390
You know, what would they add back then? They,

89
00:05:24.391 --> 00:05:27.540
maybe they were panning for gold and shit. I don't know.

90
00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:30.240
I don't know what you would have a value back then, right?

91
00:05:30.241 --> 00:05:32.580
Everybody walking around looking like Johnny Appleseed,

92
00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.810
why do they have so many do? Um,

93
00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:41.550
so anyways, that's like the big fucking highlight in my day. And, uh,

94
00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:43.890
also speaking at which I've watched the, uh,

95
00:05:43.891 --> 00:05:47.760
the Bruins replay today of them playing the Columbus blue jackets.

96
00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:51.960
And once again, another great game was great to see Adam McQuade come back.

97
00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:54.510
And as much as Marshawn scoring streak ended,

98
00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:59.660
Louie Erickson's has kept his going and a fucking Bruins man.

99
00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:02.590
I'm not telling you I can't stress it enough. Like I was go,

100
00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:05.000
they got rid of Lou Cheech and all those guys. I was like,

101
00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:08.660
are going to absolutely suck this year and we are a solid fucking team.

102
00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:14.900
Um, so anyway, so I'm watching the game and at one point,

103
00:06:14.901 --> 00:06:16.400
I dunno if anybody watched the game,

104
00:06:16.401 --> 00:06:21.401
they were doing this camera angle where it was almost at like the top of the

105
00:06:21.591 --> 00:06:25.190
building. So it'd be like if he had like upper deck seats,

106
00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:28.580
he could really watch like the play develop. Um,

107
00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:31.010
and I just thought it was a great camera angle.

108
00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:36.680
If the NHL wanted to get more course, they want to get more. Right? Of course.

109
00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:39.350
They want to get more fans. They want to make more money. It's like the NFL,

110
00:06:39.351 --> 00:06:42.500
I was talking to somebody last night and they were trying to claim that the

111
00:06:42.501 --> 00:06:46.100
fucking Jacksonville Jaguars might move to London.

112
00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:51.330
All right. And I don't mean Connecticut isn't there? London and Connecticut. Um,

113
00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:56.480
London, England, like that's how we're gonna.

114
00:06:56.660 --> 00:07:01.490
That's our first move to make NFL football worldwide.

115
00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:03.920
We're going to take our worst fucking franchise

116
00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:09.970
and put that thing on point. Um, evidently it's owned by some, uh,

117
00:07:09.971 --> 00:07:12.410
I think Pakistanian guys something. And who lives in England?

118
00:07:12.411 --> 00:07:14.450
I have no fucking idea. That's what somebody was trying to tell me.

119
00:07:14.451 --> 00:07:17.660
I have no idea. I was in a bar. People were talking, I was nodding,

120
00:07:17.661 --> 00:07:20.390
my eyebrows were up going, Oh really? Rarely.

121
00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:23.540
And now I'm just telling you what I heard. I haven't looked at any of this.

122
00:07:23.541 --> 00:07:26.240
I didn't even Wikipedia the bullshit. I'm telling you right now.

123
00:07:26.241 --> 00:07:28.730
So take all of that with a giant grain of salt.

124
00:07:28.731 --> 00:07:30.230
Throw it over your shoulder and you know,

125
00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:34.070
do the Little Sammy Sosa Kiss your fingers. Ll Cool j thing. Right.

126
00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:38.690
Anyways, um, and I think by, I know sitting there going,

127
00:07:38.691 --> 00:07:42.620
why the fuck would the NFL want to put a team in London? Like,

128
00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:46.130
why can't you just be happy being like billionaires? Like,

129
00:07:46.131 --> 00:07:47.030
isn't that enough for you?

130
00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:52.690
And I think they're jealous of world cup soccer because as much as the Superbowl

131
00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:55.310
is this giant thing or we think it's this giant thing,

132
00:07:55.311 --> 00:07:59.810
it got like I guess like 80 to 100 million views or something. Once again,

133
00:07:59.811 --> 00:08:01.040
I'm just throwing these numbers out there,

134
00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:06.640
but recently like a soccer or football is what I should really call it

135
00:08:07.251 --> 00:08:08.810
considering that's what the world calls it.

136
00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:11.323
<v 3>Um,</v>

137
00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:14.250
<v 0>you know, it's funny when they say they go, what do you call it?</v>

138
00:08:14.251 --> 00:08:18.090
Football when you carry it and it's just like, it's like,

139
00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:20.160
I don't know if somebody had the great joke,

140
00:08:20.161 --> 00:08:22.950
but why don't you call it feet ball? You know,

141
00:08:22.951 --> 00:08:25.890
you'd be able to use both of them, right. If you want to be fucking clever.

142
00:08:25.891 --> 00:08:29.130
Cons about it. Um, so anyways,

143
00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:32.100
football world cup feat ball had a,

144
00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:35.610
some game that was just some regional final or whatever the fuck it was,

145
00:08:35.611 --> 00:08:37.770
a friendly, whatever the fuck they call it.

146
00:08:38.310 --> 00:08:43.230
It's one of those ones that isn't the World Cup and it got like a billion views

147
00:08:43.410 --> 00:08:46.920
like out of the seven and a half billion people on this fucking planet.

148
00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:49.813
<v 3>Um,</v>

149
00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:52.990
<v 0>it got a billion fucking views. So they sit in that go,</v>

150
00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:54.830
we've got to go global with us. Shit.

151
00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:57.240
And our first move was going to be descent,

152
00:08:57.290 --> 00:09:00.780
evidently the Jacksonville Jaguars out to fucking London,

153
00:09:00.781 --> 00:09:05.660
England to a bunch of fish and chip eating cuts. Um,

154
00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:09.880
anyways, I'm fucking with you. So anyway, so I'm watching that.

155
00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:11.910
The Bruins game.

156
00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:16.940
So they do this camera angle from up top of the building and you can really

157
00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:19.260
watch the play develop,

158
00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:23.550
especially if you're like a novice fan of hockey because the fact that they're

159
00:09:23.551 --> 00:09:26.010
to the side, you know,

160
00:09:26.011 --> 00:09:28.590
if you've played hockey and you've gone to enough hockey games,

161
00:09:28.591 --> 00:09:30.570
like you actually have to watch,

162
00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:34.470
you got to know what's going on like three feet off of the screen,

163
00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:36.121
you know,

164
00:09:36.121 --> 00:09:40.710
like literally like you'll see a team bringing the puck down the ice and a guy

165
00:09:40.711 --> 00:09:44.400
flips it into the zone and then the entire team disappears as the camera follows

166
00:09:44.401 --> 00:09:47.640
the puck. Now if you don't watch hockey, you're going like, well,

167
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.240
what the fuck did everybody just quit? Where'd they go? You don't realize that?

168
00:09:51.241 --> 00:09:56.130
Oh, it's a line change. Um, now with this angle you could do that.

169
00:09:56.131 --> 00:09:58.200
And I was actually thinking what would be cool is, you know,

170
00:09:58.201 --> 00:10:01.110
the NFL has those cameras on fucking why

171
00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:07.920
they should do that. They should have a camera.

172
00:10:08.070 --> 00:10:13.070
Like I would say that you should run a line right across the red line

173
00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:17.610
that they still have even though they don't even use it anymore. Okay.

174
00:10:17.611 --> 00:10:18.960
And you have one camera pointed down,

175
00:10:18.961 --> 00:10:22.890
one end and the other down the other and basically you just follow the puck up

176
00:10:22.891 --> 00:10:27.330
the ice. Um, as you normally do throughout the whole game.

177
00:10:27.331 --> 00:10:32.331
But anytime there's like a power play or if a team establishes themselves in the

178
00:10:32.941 --> 00:10:37.830
offensive zone, you would then cut to that camera and you could really,

179
00:10:37.831 --> 00:10:40.770
you could basically see what everybody was doing.

180
00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:44.580
Cause a lot of times when it goes out to the point you can't see what's going

181
00:10:44.581 --> 00:10:48.210
on. If somebody down behind the neck, you could just be, you know,

182
00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:52.500
seeing the entire thing. And then the second it fucking, you know,

183
00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:55.220
the other team gains control the puck and they comp the IC.

184
00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:58.470
Just flip back to that traditional view that they always show.

185
00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:01.020
And Oh, freckles,

186
00:11:01.021 --> 00:11:03.690
fucking brain was going when I was watching this and I was thinking,

187
00:11:03.691 --> 00:11:04.021
you know what,

188
00:11:04.021 --> 00:11:09.021
I bet in the future they'll have something like that and probably they'll end up

189
00:11:10.681 --> 00:11:15.240
having cameras in the helmets and you'll be able to at home,

190
00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:19.050
act like the guy in one of those Monday night football trucks and you'll be able

191
00:11:19.051 --> 00:11:20.460
to direct your own game.

192
00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:26.160
And then the NHL would have like a show us your best edit of fucking,

193
00:11:26.161 --> 00:11:29.520
you know, whatever McQuaids slap,

194
00:11:29.521 --> 00:11:33.930
slap up from the point or whatever and you get to to show your, your, uh,

195
00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:37.950
your edited version of the fucking game. Like in the future,

196
00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:41.130
just be able to flip around and it'll drive everybody fucking nuts who's trying

197
00:11:41.131 --> 00:11:42.180
to watch the game.

198
00:11:42.570 --> 00:11:46.660
And then there'll be an old grizzled cut like me going old school. Oh look,

199
00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:50.490
the TV dictate the angles, you know. Um,

200
00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:56.500
but anyways, I just thought it was like a cool, uh, way to watch the game.

201
00:11:56.501 --> 00:11:59.050
And, and um, the NHL is,

202
00:11:59.051 --> 00:12:03.670
was actually ahead of everybody else by having onscreen graphics.

203
00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:08.080
They just came out too early and went too hard when they had the flaming trail

204
00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:12.130
behind the puck and everybody laughed at him and ridiculed him and everything.

205
00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:16.060
But now when you look at NFL football and they have like the first down thing is

206
00:12:16.061 --> 00:12:20.620
all lit up and everybody's drawn all over the screens and all of that show.

207
00:12:20.621 --> 00:12:25.240
I guess Madden was doing that beforehand. Um, I dunno,

208
00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:27.310
I just thought it was a cool way, you know something.

209
00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:30.580
I thought it was a good idea and then I said it out loud and I still think it's

210
00:12:30.581 --> 00:12:34.570
a good idea but I really just bombed in the presentation. But I'm,

211
00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:40.780
speaking of which, as far as like hockey, I guess Las Vegas,

212
00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:43.480
even though they haven't been awarded a team yet,

213
00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:48.670
is just gone ahead and just building a stadium that evidently is going to be one

214
00:12:48.671 --> 00:12:51.730
of the best stadiums in the league if they're allowed in the league,

215
00:12:52.090 --> 00:12:57.090
which is exciting and really fucking annoying to me as a Bruins fan,

216
00:12:57.550 --> 00:13:01.180
one of the original six teams, the fact that we just went down to home depot,

217
00:13:01.181 --> 00:13:02.050
as I've always said,

218
00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:07.200
and just bought 50,000 fucking cinderblocks and built a rectangle considering we

219
00:13:07.481 --> 00:13:11.950
used to play in the Boston Garden, which was one of the fucking, you know, MCAS.

220
00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:15.110
I don't want to use that fucking Madison Square Garden World. It was,

221
00:13:15.111 --> 00:13:18.670
it was a fucking church. It was a cathedral. It was an old barn.

222
00:13:18.671 --> 00:13:22.210
It was the shit. All right. And the fact that we just, you know,

223
00:13:22.810 --> 00:13:26.890
the fact that the Dallas Stars have a better fucking, you know, Minnesota wild,

224
00:13:27.310 --> 00:13:30.070
they got a bet. They got a way better,

225
00:13:30.071 --> 00:13:33.670
way more personality and shit to those fucking venues than what we have is a

226
00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:36.820
goddamn crime. So now in Las Vegas,

227
00:13:36.821 --> 00:13:41.380
they're building a fucking arena for a team. They don't even have yet.

228
00:13:41.381 --> 00:13:43.930
I just saw it like halfway completed. I go, look at this, fuck,

229
00:13:43.931 --> 00:13:45.010
this place looks amazing.

230
00:13:46.810 --> 00:13:50.080
So I immediately started thinking like, well wait a minute.

231
00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:55.600
Vegas is going to have a team. What would you call the team? Now,

232
00:13:55.601 --> 00:13:58.770
back in the day, you could call them what they should be called this.

233
00:13:58.870 --> 00:14:02.980
You call them like the gamblers. You know, remember the Houston gamblers,

234
00:14:02.981 --> 00:14:05.770
they had the gamblers back in, uh, the USFL days.

235
00:14:05.770 --> 00:14:09.400
They were the Houston gamblers. But you know, there's no fucking way,

236
00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:11.560
there's no fucking way they'll do that.

237
00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:14.650
They should call them the fucking Vegas gamblers, right?

238
00:14:14.770 --> 00:14:18.310
And their mascot should be like this degenerate gambler, right?

239
00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:22.180
Just look at some procast guy, you know? But it's a,

240
00:14:22.181 --> 00:14:24.850
it's a fucking mascot looking thing. So it's, it's funny,

241
00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:29.110
Kinda like being the town drunk used to be funny before they said, no,

242
00:14:29.111 --> 00:14:33.640
he's an alcoholic. He has a disease. And you know, all the foster Brooks guys,

243
00:14:33.950 --> 00:14:37.150
stop losing. Stop getting work. You know,

244
00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:39.580
he know what's going to fucking happen.

245
00:14:39.581 --> 00:14:43.570
All these fucking Goddamn Pansy fucking soccer mom,

246
00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:49.570
mini van drive and douchebags, they're going to end up calling them like,

247
00:14:49.630 --> 00:14:53.570
I don't know the Oh, the road runners,

248
00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:55.733
you know?

249
00:14:56.190 --> 00:14:56.350
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

250
00:14:56.350 --> 00:14:58.990
<v 0>Not even, they won't even call them the sidewinders, you know,</v>

251
00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:01.750
cause well that's a poisonous snake and you know,

252
00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:03.730
we don't want to scare the children.

253
00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:05.263
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

254
00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:08.810
<v 0>You know, I just, I don't fucking understand it.</v>

255
00:15:09.650 --> 00:15:11.100
Why can't you call them the gamblers?

256
00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:14.690
You have a degenerate gambler as a mascot and then you teach your kid a lesson.

257
00:15:14.691 --> 00:15:16.310
You see that? You see that fucking right.

258
00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:20.570
That's what happens when you go on these goddamn casinos. Yeah. All right. No,

259
00:15:20.571 --> 00:15:23.420
I'm not getting you another fucking popcorn. Yanna Nah.

260
00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:25.083
<v 4>Okay.</v>

261
00:15:25.350 --> 00:15:28.890
<v 0>Old School parenting. Old School parenting.</v>

262
00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:33.180
Was it at one point during the game you took your kid too. You made him cry.

263
00:15:34.070 --> 00:15:38.860
All right. And I'll tell you right now, the day that that ended,

264
00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:41.100
there was the day that this country started going down the shitter.

265
00:15:43.710 --> 00:15:47.850
I'm sorry. Anyways, what? W what do you go am I want to hear you guys' guesses.

266
00:15:47.851 --> 00:15:49.020
What do you think they're going to call them?

267
00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:51.893
<v 4>Huh?</v>

268
00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:57.500
<v 0>The maces, the Pueblos, you can't say pueblos there. Those were,</v>

269
00:15:57.610 --> 00:16:01.690
there was a native American group, so they'll get upset. The uh,

270
00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:08.260
the star dust, you know,

271
00:16:08.261 --> 00:16:11.770
they're gonna do that. If you can't call a team the devil rays,

272
00:16:12.270 --> 00:16:16.660
if you just got to switch it to the res because people are so fucking paranoid

273
00:16:16.661 --> 00:16:18.070
that if you call it the devil rays,

274
00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:22.780
that one of their kids is going to get fucking a, what do they call it?

275
00:16:22.781 --> 00:16:27.350
Possessed of off of the name of a fucking baseball team or what,

276
00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:32.060
what horrific is great as this stadium is as awesome as it would be.

277
00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:33.290
I don't know why. Like I'm,

278
00:16:33.291 --> 00:16:38.240
I'm totally against teams being down in the sunbelt except in Vegas.

279
00:16:38.390 --> 00:16:42.950
Vegas needs to have a team and you know what, they should be fucking shifty,

280
00:16:43.190 --> 00:16:47.630
shady, any fucking thing that begins with sh other than Shitty,

281
00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:52.280
you know, they should cheat. They should have like a bunch of Kentlands mins.

282
00:16:52.281 --> 00:16:53.750
I don't want fucking knee breakers,

283
00:16:53.751 --> 00:16:58.700
but they do seem to be the cheapest mother fuckers in the league. You know,

284
00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:02.960
just old school fucking shit. That would be great. That would be great.

285
00:17:02.961 --> 00:17:05.690
That's not going to happen. That's not going to happen. They'll put,

286
00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:09.440
they'll call them the fucking, uh, uh, what do they call them?

287
00:17:10.580 --> 00:17:11.211
Something like that.

288
00:17:11.211 --> 00:17:14.600
This star dust and they'll hire the first female head coach. They just,

289
00:17:14.601 --> 00:17:16.220
they're going to build it. They'll go that route.

290
00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:19.340
That's the direction it's all heading. You know,

291
00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:25.360
we should've known when when times square went from like fucking a place where

292
00:17:25.521 --> 00:17:29.390
you could jerk off while someone mopped it up simultaneously. Right.

293
00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:34.400
If some one legged freak was doing a dance in front of you to go into like the M

294
00:17:34.401 --> 00:17:39.350
and m store and now they have chairs where you can sit down in the middle of the

295
00:17:39.351 --> 00:17:41.870
fucking street once, once that went that direction.

296
00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:44.180
How did I not see the direction? That's sports.

297
00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:48.170
We're going to go and you know that everyone was going to get a ribbon.

298
00:17:49.890 --> 00:17:53.470
You know, I don't know. I don't, I don't want to get into this fight.

299
00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:55.590
I don't even get to this shit. What happened? I was in a great mood.

300
00:17:55.650 --> 00:18:00.000
I have I to live with these fucking door locks. All right. What are we into?

301
00:18:00.001 --> 00:18:03.090
17 minutes in a year, checking in on you here. Um,

302
00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:07.230
what else did I want to talk about here in this thing? Oh my God,

303
00:18:07.231 --> 00:18:10.710
I lost my shit. I've been doing so well with my temper lately.

304
00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:12.180
You wouldn't know it from this podcast,

305
00:18:12.181 --> 00:18:15.630
but all Billy's been making some strikes. Um,

306
00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:18.330
I don't want to happen. About a month ago,

307
00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:22.500
I started to flip out when I was in the car. No, I was in an airport.

308
00:18:22.530 --> 00:18:26.250
That's right. Car Airport. When you get to my age, it's all the same thing.

309
00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:29.310
It's some form of transportation, whether you're in it or standing,

310
00:18:29.311 --> 00:18:30.590
trying to get on it. It's all like,

311
00:18:30.790 --> 00:18:34.080
you just sorta all blends into one thing and then all of a sudden you just like,

312
00:18:34.081 --> 00:18:38.460
it's Christmas. That's what getting old is. All right.

313
00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:41.280
You don't know where you are and all of a sudden it's Christmas again.

314
00:18:41.281 --> 00:18:44.100
That's basically what you have to look forward to. All right,

315
00:18:44.130 --> 00:18:47.280
so with that depressing thought, let's plow forward. So we're in this,

316
00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:51.780
we're at the airport and I went to this guy cap, you know,

317
00:18:51.781 --> 00:18:53.760
rather than go into the fucking electronic,

318
00:18:53.761 --> 00:18:56.910
faceless current thing that I'm supposed to, you know, that can't read my

319
00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:02.730
credit card and all of that horse shit is what one person to help 70 people on

320
00:19:02.731 --> 00:19:03.564
these things.

321
00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:08.070
I go to this fucking guy and he ends up shooting the shit with somebody else.

322
00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:12.450
He takes for fucking ever. And I was starting to lose my shit as I do, as I do.

323
00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:17.190
I don't have control of my emotions. My emotions have control of me. Um,

324
00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:22.710
my wife just tapped me and she just goes, given a minute. It's all she said,

325
00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:24.750
give it a minute. And for some reason,

326
00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:29.400
I don't know why that is just stuck in my head. And as I, you know,

327
00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:32.970
more times than not, when I start to flip out, I just think, give it a minute,

328
00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:36.500
take a breath, just give it a minute. And it's been really fucking work.

329
00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:41.400
And for me about, you know, 11% of the time, um, which is,

330
00:19:41.401 --> 00:19:44.820
you know, whatever, you know, I'm 11% better.

331
00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:50.220
So last night I get in the car, it's fucking raining out here. So you know,

332
00:19:50.221 --> 00:19:51.870
the Delia starts to rain out here.

333
00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:55.830
Everybody freaks the fuck out because you know, they're not used to,

334
00:19:55.890 --> 00:19:58.110
I don't know what the deal is. I guess there's a bunch of

335
00:19:59.730 --> 00:20:03.570
fluids from cars just build up and it doesn't get washed away. So yeah,

336
00:20:03.571 --> 00:20:07.950
I guess the roads are a little more slippery. But anyways,

337
00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:12.330
so I'm driving to pick my wife up, right?

338
00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:16.980
And I'm at this red light and I'm the third person in line at the red light.

339
00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:18.263
Okay.

340
00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:22.590
So when you're the third person in line to make a left in Los Angeles,

341
00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:27.150
your eyes are fucking locked in on the movements of the person who's in the pole

342
00:20:27.151 --> 00:20:31.770
position. And you need that fucker to make a move. Okay?

343
00:20:31.771 --> 00:20:35.700
Take a little bit of risk or you're not going to make the light. Okay?

344
00:20:36.150 --> 00:20:40.020
So I'm just sitting there, locked in on that thing, like my fucking pit bull.

345
00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:43.770
When it hears a noise at the front door and it's fucking ears goes up and it's

346
00:20:43.771 --> 00:20:48.430
such going low and it's fucking here. That's,

347
00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:53.300
that's the fucking mode I'm in. And do you know, I watched this stupid La cunt.

348
00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:57.970
All right. Or whatever transplant, not going to blame the city here

349
00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:02.860
goes to make a left stops.

350
00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:08.290
Okay. Stops the somebody in the crosswalk.

351
00:21:08.350 --> 00:21:12.130
So the person stops. Okay.

352
00:21:12.131 --> 00:21:15.310
And then the traffic that's trying to drive through one person is making a right

353
00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:16.870
where that person's making the left.

354
00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:20.380
So they're waiting for the person that crosswalk and the other person is trying

355
00:21:20.381 --> 00:21:21.214
to make a left.

356
00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:25.570
So this person is not blocking because both people are turning,

357
00:21:25.810 --> 00:21:27.730
one's turning on the same street as the fucking lefty.

358
00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:29.950
Cont and the elements go in the other direction.

359
00:21:31.110 --> 00:21:35.400
Do you know for whatever fucking reason, this asshole,

360
00:21:36.530 --> 00:21:37.363
like,

361
00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:37.830
<v 5>okay,</v>

362
00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:39.170
<v 0>I don't know what they did. They just,</v>

363
00:21:39.171 --> 00:21:44.140
a person got through the crosswalk and then rather than going, I, I,

364
00:21:44.150 --> 00:21:47.230
and I'm like three cars back on what Jeff? Oh fucking,

365
00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:51.000
you know what they did. You never going to guess.

366
00:21:51.990 --> 00:21:54.900
They backed up and got back in line,

367
00:21:56.730 --> 00:22:00.180
backed up in fucking was at 2007,

368
00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:04.320
nine years coming up on nine years of living out here.

369
00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:08.220
That is the most fucked up moron move I've ever seen.

370
00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:12.750
And you want to talk about not giving it a minute and absolutely losing your

371
00:22:12.751 --> 00:22:16.600
shit. Aye. I literally was in the car.

372
00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:21.750
And when you fucking fucking and then said the word that isn't acceptable now

373
00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:27.320
anymore. It used to mean you're a jerk. Um,

374
00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:34.430
and also begins with an f. And then what I did was, you know, it was funny,

375
00:22:34.431 --> 00:22:37.340
right after I did that, cause I yelled and I had to do a show.

376
00:22:37.341 --> 00:22:41.090
I reached into my console and I put a lodge in my mouth.

377
00:22:43.950 --> 00:22:44.760
<v 6>Okay.</v>

378
00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:49.470
<v 0>And I immediately laughed at myself and saw how ridiculous I was big. Um,</v>

379
00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:54.340
I really wish I could control my emotions more. Um,

380
00:22:54.670 --> 00:22:56.290
I've never noticed because I grew around,

381
00:22:56.320 --> 00:23:01.150
I grew up around a bunch of fucking hotheads and I never realized like it's

382
00:23:01.151 --> 00:23:05.290
finally dawning on me as I approached the fucking half century mark.

383
00:23:06.730 --> 00:23:11.100
Um, it's, it's finally dawning on me, uh,

384
00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:12.460
what a weakness that is.

385
00:23:13.810 --> 00:23:14.360
<v 5>Okay.</v>

386
00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:17.930
<v 0>Yeah, I know I, and because it's just dawning on me now,</v>

387
00:23:17.931 --> 00:23:20.840
I can't really articulate it. It's one of those, those, uh,

388
00:23:22.990 --> 00:23:23.660
one of those mobile,

389
00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:26.710
I'm trying to think of them Hollywood movie I've seen where somebody just gets

390
00:23:26.711 --> 00:23:30.160
caught up in their own fucking power and then halfway through it they're like,

391
00:23:30.161 --> 00:23:34.900
wait, we're the victims. Right? We're what the fuck movie was that?

392
00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:38.940
Oh, shit

393
00:23:41.210 --> 00:23:46.210
was this great movie with this guy was getting picked on and then he just took

394
00:23:46.421 --> 00:23:47.680
fucking control.

395
00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:48.833
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

396
00:23:49.090 --> 00:23:51.610
<v 0>And then he started abusing his power and then the end,</v>

397
00:23:51.611 --> 00:23:54.670
he just sort of kind of dawned on him that, wait a minute, I w I w

398
00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:57.590
I'm right. Right.

399
00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:02.360
As he see seeing the fucking hurt that he caused other people,

400
00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:06.800
and I want to say, blows his brains out. Ah,

401
00:24:06.850 --> 00:24:08.200
Jesus Christ bill. You know,

402
00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:12.160
that's what I got to find a dollar for every fucking movie. I lie. I forgot.

403
00:24:12.161 --> 00:24:15.550
You know, I'd have a good 250 bucks.

404
00:24:17.170 --> 00:24:20.590
Um, all right, let's, uh, let's read a little advertising here for this, uh,

405
00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:24.850
for this Thursday afternoon, um, headspace.

406
00:24:27.930 --> 00:24:32.930
All right, let's be honest. Most of your problems start with your mind. Fear,

407
00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:37.430
anger, stress. Oh, Jesus, wasn't it? Was I not telling the perfect story. Fear,

408
00:24:37.431 --> 00:24:40.670
anger, stress, anxiety, depression, sleeplessness.

409
00:24:41.780 --> 00:24:44.990
They begin in your head, but they can wreck your life.

410
00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:47.393
<v 3>Um,</v>

411

<v 0>please include all of the following points during your read.</v>

412
00:24:50.570 --> 00:24:51.800
Why did they write that?

413
00:24:52.330 --> 00:24:53.163
<v 3>Okay,</v>

414
00:24:53.810 --> 00:24:55.880
<v 0>I'm going to read everything you wrote. All right.</v>

415
00:24:56.600 --> 00:25:00.530
I've said this on numerous episodes, okay? But it doesn't have to be that way.

416
00:25:01.310 --> 00:25:03.830
You can make a major difference in just 10 minutes a day.

435
00:26:14.270 --> 00:26:17.090
you know, as I listen to the people fuck on the other side of the wall,

436
00:26:17.330 --> 00:26:21.920
I am able to block it out through deep breathing and focusing and quieting my

437
00:26:21.921 --> 00:26:26.120
mind and becoming one with the universe. Hey there fucking,

450
00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:12.950
Don't waste a second of the new year and a crowded mall.

451
00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:17.870
What Trunk Club you can make 2016 your most stylish year yet and the best part

452
00:27:17.871 --> 00:27:20.300
is you won't have to do any of the work yourself. You know what?

453
00:27:20.301 --> 00:27:24.080
I just realized the most arrogant thing you could ever do,

454
00:27:24.590 --> 00:27:28.760
you know as a rich person is your joint trunk club and that person has to go

455
00:27:28.761 --> 00:27:32.810
down the mall and some psycho goes down there and pulls out a gun and does one

456
00:27:32.811 --> 00:27:37.811
of those mass shootings and you still bitch that it took too long for the trunk

457
00:27:38.061 --> 00:27:40.280
to get there. Even though that person went down there,

458
00:27:40.281 --> 00:27:43.220
which should have been you and they had to go down there and dodge the bullets.

459
00:27:43.540 --> 00:27:45.150
Oh, I don't give a shit what happened.

460
00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:51.590
2016 it's going to be a game changer. Your fresh start.

461
00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:56.980
Start the year off on the right foot and the right pants with the right jacket

462
00:27:57.141 --> 00:28:00.800
over the right shirt. Fuck working on yourself as a person.

463
00:28:01.250 --> 00:28:02.960
You got to get the outfit, man.

464

Just approve of what you like and send back what you don't.

476
00:28:52.251 --> 00:28:54.500
Just like that a trunk arrives on your doorstep.

477
00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:59.570
And they went down there and they risked. They risked their lives, they risked,

478
00:29:00.260 --> 00:29:03.770
you know, all kinds. I don't know. They had to find a parking spot.

479
00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:06.530

485
00:29:18.411 --> 00:29:22.250
You never have to go to the mall again. You know? All right.

00:30:50.581 --> 00:30:52.260

00:30:53.370 --> 00:30:57.960
I told you guys earlier now you know that I'm an old curmudgeon here and middle

513
00:30:57.961 --> 00:31:00.720
aged curmudgeon. I mean, I don't know if I'm middle aged at this point.

514
00:31:01.020 --> 00:31:04.680
47 times two is 94 not a lot of people get to 94.

515
00:31:05.010 --> 00:31:06.870
I'm an over the hill guy who's kitten who can,

516
00:31:06.871 --> 00:31:11.360
who can still bang out fucking 10. Pullups Huh? He liked that day. Days,

517
00:31:11.890 --> 00:31:16.800
days, days. Um, what am I saying here?

518
00:31:17.580 --> 00:31:19.990
Um, I, I, yeah, I'm,

519
00:31:19.991 --> 00:31:24.991
I'm one of these fucking people that I do not give it up to young people right

520
00:31:25.031 --> 00:31:28.210
out of the fucking gate. I don't give a fuck how good a game you had.

521
00:31:28.211 --> 00:31:31.360
I don't give a fuck how good a season you have. I want to see the career.

522
00:31:32.110 --> 00:31:32.890
And you know,

523
00:31:32.890 --> 00:31:37.620
that whole crown of king began somewhere at the beginning of Shaq's career with

524
00:31:37.630 --> 00:31:38.890
that, that fucking, you know,

525
00:31:38.891 --> 00:31:42.340
when you came into the league and you already had your own fucking sneaker,

526
00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.040
you know what I mean? Um,

527
00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:46.260
<v 4>okay.</v>

528
00:31:46.260 --> 00:31:50.000
<v 0>So I never give it up to people until like, you know, people go on.</v>

529
00:31:50.010 --> 00:31:53.160
Tom Brady's the greatest of all time. I still was going like, well,

530
00:31:53.190 --> 00:31:56.430
Joe Montana has four rings and it only took them four times to get it.

531
00:31:57.210 --> 00:32:01.380
He won with nobody's, he won with superstar teams. All right.

532
00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:06.390
So until this guy does something above and beyond him,

533
00:32:06.391 --> 00:32:09.720
the best he could do is be on his level. I'm one of those guys,

534
00:32:10.050 --> 00:32:14.100
having said that, Steph curry is the greatest fucking shooter of all time.

535
00:32:14.910 --> 00:32:19.020
I believe. I already think that. So I made it, uh,

536
00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:23.940
a promise as a sports fan that I was going to try and see him this year. Um,

537
00:32:24.630 --> 00:32:28.950
see him as soon as I can while he's still fucking young and he's in his prime.

538
00:32:29.700 --> 00:32:32.850
You know, you've got to do that. Like I saw Jordan when he still had hair,

539
00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:35.280
you know, so, um,

540
00:32:35.580 --> 00:32:40.150
turns out I was hanging out at Lago last night doing a,

541
00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:45.160
the great Tom Poppas show down there and Al Madrigal from all things comedy,

542
00:32:46.490 --> 00:32:50.390
the creative force, the brains, the brawn, binal all things comedy.

543
00:32:50.391 --> 00:32:51.740
He was down there and he's a,

544
00:32:52.670 --> 00:32:56.420
he's a bay area guy and he watches every single golden state warriors game.

545
00:32:56.420 --> 00:33:01.070
And he said, you know what, he goes, the warriors are in town this Saturday.

546
00:33:01.670 --> 00:33:06.650
So I, uh, I woke up this morning by Dubai to Boop, I went on Stubhub,

547
00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:07.540
they'll do to, to do it.

548
00:33:07.540 --> 00:33:12.290
And I paid through the fucking nose for two fucking great seats. Um, yeah,

549
00:33:12.291 --> 00:33:14.300
I'm going to go Saturday night. Fuck it.

550
00:33:14.301 --> 00:33:18.050
I gotta see this guy and I'm going to get there early for the shoot around. So,

551
00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:21.680
cause I want to see him put on a show and I'm hearing people talking about how

552
00:33:21.681 --> 00:33:24.020
fucking unreal is just to watch the guys shoot around.

553
00:33:24.021 --> 00:33:29.021
And it's reminding me of when I went to a San Diego Padres game back in May of

554
00:33:31.251 --> 00:33:36.020
1998 I remember me, this comedian, Dan Smith,

555
00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:39.320
now the Boston guy. We went down there and it was,

556
00:33:39.321 --> 00:33:43.310
we saw mark McGwire and this is when they, you know,

557
00:33:44.690 --> 00:33:48.140
this is when they were, uh, you know, going after the Roger Maris record,

558
00:33:48.770 --> 00:33:49.131
you know,

559
00:33:49.131 --> 00:33:52.490
and everybody was having Andrews Steam delivered to their house in their wife's

560
00:33:52.491 --> 00:33:54.320
name. I'm actually going to look it up.

561
00:33:54.410 --> 00:33:57.830
I'm going to find you that exact fucking date. San Diego Padres,

562
00:33:58.610 --> 00:34:01.910
1998 schedule.

563
00:34:02.770 --> 00:34:05.600
That's fucking hilarious that this still exist. That some,

564
00:34:05.630 --> 00:34:09.170
who the fuck look this up today. 1998.

565
00:34:09.171 --> 00:34:12.530
San Diego Padres schedule. I remember it was may 20 something.

566
00:34:14.150 --> 00:34:18.230
Where the fuck was it? It was the candles. All right.

567
00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:20.360
This is some fucking,

568
00:34:21.700 --> 00:34:22.210
<v 5>okay.</v>

569
00:34:22.210 --> 00:34:24.760
<v 0>Ah, Jesus Christ. They had the games numbered rather than the date.</v>

570
00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:29.290
You fuck out there. There's a date. Sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

571
00:34:29.291 --> 00:34:32.620
So sorry. Come on. Where is it? Where is it?

572
00:34:33.830 --> 00:34:38.540
Right there. Go Fuck Yourself. Five 29,

573
00:34:38.541 --> 00:34:42.890
1998 or five 30 or five 31.

574
00:34:43.070 --> 00:34:45.050
It wasn't June. I remember it wasn't June.

575
00:34:45.051 --> 00:34:50.051
I went to one of those fucking games against the St Louis Cardinals and we got

576
00:34:50.331 --> 00:34:55.250
there early and we watched mark McGwire take batting practice. And um,

577
00:34:56.180 --> 00:34:58.040
if there's any footage of that,

578
00:34:58.250 --> 00:35:02.810
if you could have been there and watched the performance this man put on and you

579
00:35:02.811 --> 00:35:05.960
still think that performance enhancing drugs should be illegal.

580
00:35:06.110 --> 00:35:10.340
You're out of your fucking mind. These people are special.

581
00:35:11.060 --> 00:35:15.800
These people are better than us. Okay. You know,

582
00:35:15.801 --> 00:35:18.260
when you take a Prius to the fucking gas station,

583
00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:20.960
do you put the fucking the,

584
00:35:21.050 --> 00:35:25.240
you put premium super fucking the best gas. You don't,

585
00:35:25.241 --> 00:35:28.370
you give it the shit gas, right?

586
00:35:29.090 --> 00:35:32.510
You pull up in a fucking super car, you give it the,

587
00:35:32.511 --> 00:35:36.950
you put the best fuel in it that you can. All right. And you know what it is?

588
00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:40.170
I don't think it sees athletes fall. I think it's the people in the crowd.

589
00:35:40.290 --> 00:35:42.170
We don't want to admit that. Well, you know, we are,

590
00:35:42.260 --> 00:35:44.490
we're a bunch of Toyota Prius. That's what we are.

591
00:35:46.890 --> 00:35:51.890
Bunch of Ford escorts and we deserved that shit food that they feed us and fuel

592
00:35:52.021 --> 00:35:52.801
our bodies with.

593
00:35:52.801 --> 00:35:56.760
As we sit there and just getting the Itus in the fifth ending from all the booze

594
00:35:56.761 --> 00:36:00.840
and fucking hotdogs, you weight these fucking athletes. They're better than us.

595
00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:01.980
They're special.

596
00:36:03.870 --> 00:36:08.160
They need the high octane fuel and they should go out there and put on a fucking

597
00:36:08.161 --> 00:36:13.040
show and fill up our lives. Right.

598
00:36:14.410 --> 00:36:15.880
Anyways, I'll tell you right now,

599
00:36:15.910 --> 00:36:20.910
I would rather watch a fucking roided up athlete take batting practice than

600
00:36:22.010 --> 00:36:25.810
watching all natural one break down at 35 and remind me that I'm going to die

601
00:36:26.530 --> 00:36:29.050
someday. You know what I mean? I want him to be super human.

602
00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:33.940
I want that to be three times the size it was before they started their career.

603
00:36:33.970 --> 00:36:36.690
Fuck that. Those people,

604
00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:39.510
they're heroes they use in themselves as Guinea pigs.

605
00:36:39.511 --> 00:36:42.120
They put that shit in there, bought it in and what the fuck it was.

606
00:36:43.220 --> 00:36:46.070
They didn't know what the fuck it was because they wanted to make you happy.

607
00:36:46.670 --> 00:36:49.740
They wanted to hear you cheer, right.

608
00:36:49.850 --> 00:36:53.720
They want to see your little kid go boil. Poised is the greatest time ever.

609
00:36:53.900 --> 00:36:57.740
And then they wanted to go out and have their choice of pussy after the game.

610
00:36:58.100 --> 00:37:02.990
Top shelf, high octane, fucking Victoria's secret policy. And they,

611
00:37:03.230 --> 00:37:04.130
God damn it, they earned it.

612
00:37:04.940 --> 00:37:05.773
<v 4>Okay.</v>

613
00:37:05.890 --> 00:37:09.790
<v 0>All you walking around letting somebody shoot horse horse tranquilizers into</v>

614
00:37:09.791 --> 00:37:10.780
your fucking ass.

615
00:37:12.210 --> 00:37:12.470
<v 4>Okay.</v>

616
00:37:12.470 --> 00:37:14.330
<v 0>You know, and then what do you get? What do you get?</v>

617
00:37:15.740 --> 00:37:19.010
What do you get to as a thank you, you got to sit in front of the Senate.

618
00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:20.090
They make you cry.

619
00:37:23.900 --> 00:37:26.720
If I was running this nation, no, I swear to God,

620
00:37:27.140 --> 00:37:30.950
I love that athletes use performance enhancing drugs and I hope they continue to

621
00:37:30.951 --> 00:37:33.290
do it because as much as people are condemning it,

622
00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:36.860
we learn things by them using them and eventually they're going to figure out

623
00:37:36.861 --> 00:37:39.790
how to make them safe. And when I'm old, yeah,

624
00:37:40.250 --> 00:37:44.870
when I'm old and you guys go to see me at a casino when I am 94 and I am fucking

625
00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:49.580
jacks with a full head of fucking hair. You can thank the mark McGuire's.

626
00:37:50.460 --> 00:37:54.520
Okay. You could take the fucking [inaudible], the other,

627
00:37:54.910 --> 00:37:56.940
whoever the fuck else took it. I don't know who the fuck I don't.

628
00:37:56.980 --> 00:38:01.760
Who gives a shit? You could thank Peyton Manning's wife. All right.

629
00:38:01.761 --> 00:38:03.950
If she didn't blow out her fucking shoulder taking,

630
00:38:03.951 --> 00:38:07.380
those are the oven and she didn't need that shit. Goddammit.

631
00:38:08.540 --> 00:38:12.940
Can somebody please make a picture of me at 94 Jack with a full head of hair

632
00:38:12.970 --> 00:38:17.890
wearing a Tuxedo, playing the stardust, cheering on the Vegas Guff.

633
00:38:17.891 --> 00:38:20.760
Shut the fuck up, Bill. Alright, that's the end of the podcast here.

634
00:38:21.130 --> 00:38:23.380
Anybody have a wonderful weekend? Um,

635
00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:27.700
I'm going to make a little video of my new door locks when I get them in there

636
00:38:28.060 --> 00:38:29.680
and I'll be excited about it.

637
00:38:29.681 --> 00:38:32.780
And you guys can shit all over it because it's the internet. All right.

638
00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:35.110
Fuck you too.

639
00:39:15.790 --> 00:39:17.640
<v 7>[inaudible] [inaudible] Oh, gone crazy.</v>

640
00:39:29.810 --> 00:39:30.643
[inaudible] last night

641
00:39:32.070 --> 00:39:35.460
<v 1>I was sitting on a couch Bududa [inaudible] nine in my own fucking business.</v>

642
00:39:35.461 --> 00:39:36.370
Little Dude alluded.

643
00:39:36.660 --> 00:39:40.740
I was watching metal mania on VH one.

644
00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:42.340
<v 4>Okay.</v>

645
00:39:42.340 --> 00:39:43.660
<v 1>Metal Mania. Cleo.</v>

646
00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:48.550
I think my dog is sleeping with him with his eyes open. Oh No,

647
00:39:48.551 --> 00:39:49.600
she just moved her eyebrows.

648
00:39:50.580 --> 00:39:51.040
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

649
00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:52.250
<v 1>Dude. Where the fuck did you just go?</v>

650
00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:54.353
<v 4>Huh?</v>

651
00:39:55.110 --> 00:39:57.330
<v 1>Cleo? Whatever you're thinking about, it's going to be okay.</v>

652
00:39:58.310 --> 00:39:59.143
<v 4>All right.</v>

653
00:40:01.410 --> 00:40:05.830
<v 1>Anyways. You know, it's weird when my dog sees a squirrel through a window, it,</v>

654
00:40:06.130 --> 00:40:09.540
it cries like,

655
00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:12.690
like it's a long lost buddy.

656
00:40:13.530 --> 00:40:16.800
But if my dog is outside and there's a squirrel, you know,

657
00:40:16.830 --> 00:40:20.070
if there's no window between my dog and the squirrel,

658
00:40:20.071 --> 00:40:23.820
it will try and rip its fucking head off. So I don't,

659
00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:26.700
does anybody know anything about dogs? What is it crying about? Is it crying?

660
00:40:26.701 --> 00:40:31.210
Like, Oh, I want to let that set off. Oh, I wish I could just end.

661
00:40:31.340 --> 00:40:32.370
That thing's fucking life.

662
00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:38.660
You don't make any sense to me anyway. So I'm watching fucking metal mania

663
00:40:40.610 --> 00:40:42.500
alliteration. This has gotta be a hit show, right?

664
00:40:42.501 --> 00:40:45.590
So I'm watching this shit and uh,

665
00:40:47.660 --> 00:40:50.660
at the risk of pissing off a lot of listeners,

666
00:40:51.350 --> 00:40:55.490
I think most metal slash hair metal,

667
00:40:56.180 --> 00:41:00.680
it arguably is the worst fucking music ever made.

668
00:41:01.630 --> 00:41:02.120
<v 4>Okay.</v>

669
00:41:02.120 --> 00:41:05.270
<v 1>Where's the disco? I don't know why disco gets such a bad rap.</v>

670
00:41:05.271 --> 00:41:09.470
Like disco was the, is that the default example of bad music?

671
00:41:09.471 --> 00:41:13.130
The Way Hitler is, the default example of, of evil.

672
00:41:13.630 --> 00:41:17.600
He's the next Hitler. It's always the next fucking Hitler. Never Paul Pot,

673
00:41:18.020 --> 00:41:20.760
you know, never fucking, I don't know, picking up,

674
00:41:20.790 --> 00:41:25.670
I don't even know another one. You know Ivan, the terrible,

675
00:41:26.390 --> 00:41:30.980
was that a wrestler? Was that a comic strip?

676
00:41:31.620 --> 00:41:34.910
I know. Horrible. Haggar don't fucking know. Right. See, I don't even,

677
00:41:34.911 --> 00:41:38.700
I don't even have any other examples. Who's fault is that bill?

678
00:41:38.701 --> 00:41:41.460
There's a library right down the street. I'll go fuck yourself.

679
00:41:41.461 --> 00:41:43.780
You know what I'm saying? Um,

680
00:41:45.090 --> 00:41:45.520
<v 8>yeah.</v>

681
00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:50.260
<v 1>Everybody always talks about disco and how bad disco was and it just needs to be</v>

682
00:41:50.261 --> 00:41:52.240
a changed man. Right.

683
00:41:52.241 --> 00:41:57.241
And like then they'll talk about like the police and all this new wave shit and

684
00:41:58.141 --> 00:42:00.230
the punk scene and all that. But what they,

685
00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:05.480
they completely fucking ignore is that right after disco,

686
00:42:06.100 --> 00:42:11.100
just immediately the mainstream then went over to like this fucking heavy metal

687
00:42:11.321 --> 00:42:15.000
music, like that was better than disco.

688
00:42:15.001 --> 00:42:16.530
I think it's fucking worse.

689
00:42:17.010 --> 00:42:20.490
And I think all these times where they keep saying that everybody,

690
00:42:20.670 --> 00:42:24.240
that was a big change and that this quality music came out.

691
00:42:24.241 --> 00:42:28.530
I don't know if that happens. I think it just, you know, you know,

692
00:42:28.531 --> 00:42:30.270
nirvana comes around and they're what,

693
00:42:30.271 --> 00:42:34.530
four years later everybody's listening to fucking old town or the mainstream is,

694
00:42:35.220 --> 00:42:38.490
it's just this long, tragic,

695
00:42:40.710 --> 00:42:43.890
just flat line of shit music. I was watching this shit last night,

696
00:42:43.891 --> 00:42:46.410
shit that I used to like and that my job was on the ground.

697
00:42:46.410 --> 00:42:50.730
How fucking bad it was. It was horrible. I, I actually,

698
00:42:50.820 --> 00:42:54.780
I was so bad. I was like texting paragraphs to the sensation.

699
00:42:56.850 --> 00:42:59.850
Joe De Rosa Capitol records, the guy who built capitol records. Joe De Rosa.

700
00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:03.320
I'll actually, you go, wow. I'll get a little intimate here with you. I'll,

701
00:43:03.321 --> 00:43:06.840
I'll read you the text message I fucking wrote Joe.

702
00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:09.990
Oh Joe, where the hell are we? Where the hell are we?

703
00:43:11.610 --> 00:43:15.120
Joe Harris slash heavy metal is the worst music ever made.

704
00:43:15.121 --> 00:43:19.620
Disco gets a bad rap watching metal mania on VH one.

705
00:43:19.621 --> 00:43:23.580
Guns and roses, queens, Reich, wasp, quiet riot.

706
00:43:23.820 --> 00:43:27.960
David Lee Roth Solo Shit. It's fucking God awful. Yeah.

707
00:43:27.990 --> 00:43:31.290
I saw David Lee Roth on,

708
00:43:31.291 --> 00:43:33.870
on his a Edam and smile tour

709
00:43:35.380 --> 00:43:36.890
and I saw that video last night.

710
00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:41.920
Go wing crazy from day heat.

711
00:43:43.790 --> 00:43:48.790
That sounds like a song Walbergs character would've written with John C.

712
00:43:49.910 --> 00:43:50.750
Reilly and Boogie nights.

713
00:43:50.780 --> 00:43:55.780
Remember that he will walk you and he will blow you like it was,

714
00:43:59.191 --> 00:44:03.830
it was that bad teenage Frankenstein.

715
00:44:04.050 --> 00:44:06.800
I'm a teenage package dad.

716
00:44:07.340 --> 00:44:11.150
You're telling me that that song is better than more than a woman

717
00:44:17.180 --> 00:44:18.013
<v 9>[inaudible]</v>

718
00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:22.160
<v 1>you know, I think arguably it's, I dunno,</v>

719
00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:27.400
I can't believe the shit that I used to watch and like I used to listen to this

720
00:44:27.861 --> 00:44:30.500
shit around checks, you know,

721
00:44:30.530 --> 00:44:32.970
just hopelessly thinking that this would get me laid.

722
00:44:32.971 --> 00:44:35.910
Like they would think that I was some bad-ass like loner.

723
00:44:37.970 --> 00:44:39.010
Beg your head.

724
00:44:41.420 --> 00:44:45.410
I mean the whole fucking, the fact that I never got laid in high school,

725
00:44:45.411 --> 00:44:47.720
it just fucking went away. Right in that moment.

726
00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:49.910
It was like this was what I was going to do.

727
00:44:50.300 --> 00:44:53.600
I wasn't going to try to make them laugh. I wasn't going to hit on him.

728
00:44:53.601 --> 00:44:54.800
I wasn't going to try it.

729
00:44:56.720 --> 00:45:00.050
I was just going to play this music around them and this was going to bring me

730
00:45:00.051 --> 00:45:01.490
to the fucking promise land.

731
00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:06.710
Looking like a fucking teenage Ron Howard. That was my game plan.

732
00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:10.520
Is it any wonder I failed Jesus Christ? And I remember I would,

733
00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:14.420
we watched it on a big square TV.

734
00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:20.590
Um, just watch it, lay it, damn. Lay it dad.

735
00:45:20.750 --> 00:45:23.690
This fucking horrific fucking music.

736
00:45:24.410 --> 00:45:29.030
And my dad would come in and just have his face would just be all twisted up,

737
00:45:29.031 --> 00:45:32.420

738
00:45:34.820 --> 00:45:38.150
And I thought I was a rebel. I'm, he doesn't understand me.

739
00:45:39.290 --> 00:45:42.410
You know what? He totally understood. He totally understood.

740
00:45:43.130 --> 00:45:48.130
My Dad called it back in 83 called it jungle music says a bunch of Shit.

741
00:45:50.670 --> 00:45:51.040
<v 4>Yeah,</v>

743
00:45:55.540 --> 00:45:57.970

744
00:45:59.140 --> 00:46:01.150
And there was all these shout at the devil.

745
00:46:01.390 --> 00:46:05.280
Is anybody really going to sit there and defend that fucking song? Dude

746
00:46:07.640 --> 00:46:11.360
<v 10>do, do, do, do.</v>

747
00:46:14.850 --> 00:46:14.950
[inaudible]

748
00:46:14.950 --> 00:46:16.810
<v 1>you couldn't find a game. You could fucking,</v>

749
00:46:16.811 --> 00:46:21.040
a five year old could write that on a xylophone. Shout at the devil.

750
00:46:21.790 --> 00:46:24.610
Never knew why we were shouting, you know,

751
00:46:25.540 --> 00:46:29.170
blacking lawless, laggy, lawless, that was his show name.

752
00:46:29.370 --> 00:46:33.070
And he took a radial arm saw and he cut the blade in half and put one hat,

753
00:46:33.071 --> 00:46:37.000
one blade on one of his forearms at one on the other on these leather.

754
00:46:38.150 --> 00:46:41.670
Uh, I'm going to do a bunch of dishes in an evil way. Glove.

755
00:46:42.830 --> 00:46:43.663
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

756
00:46:46.450 --> 00:46:47.840
<v 1>And we all thought he was crazy.</v>

757
00:46:48.930 --> 00:46:51.500
Can you imagine if we gave you a forearm shiver?

758
00:46:53.420 --> 00:46:57.230
It was just Eddie used to throw fucking raw meat. Your the crowd.

759
00:46:57.231 --> 00:46:57.981
A couple of them did.

760
00:46:57.981 --> 00:47:01.880
That's why that Lady Gaga Covenant Clam in that fucking Pastrami.

761
00:47:02.180 --> 00:47:06.950
It's just been done. You know, comes out in that fucking egg from Mork.

762
00:47:08.210 --> 00:47:09.043
I Dunno.

763
00:47:10.380 --> 00:47:13.230
Seen The nasally horror act my whole fucking life.

764
00:47:13.290 --> 00:47:17.730
You know those fucking checks with the big noses. They, they can, you know,

765
00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:22.110
that's like white people's answer to the big black girl who could sing a church.

766
00:47:22.140 --> 00:47:23.310
We, we, what? What the,

767
00:47:23.311 --> 00:47:27.600
what the check we bring to that fight is that the white chick with the big nose

768
00:47:28.470 --> 00:47:31.840
white chicks with big noses can sing. I don't know what it is.

769
00:47:32.410 --> 00:47:37.000
Barbara Streisand, right.

770
00:47:38.320 --> 00:47:40.660
I don't know. It's like the nose is,

771
00:47:41.260 --> 00:47:45.940
it's like that dome at the top of all those con con uh, concert halls.

772
00:47:45.970 --> 00:47:49.420
There you go, Bill. Try to spit it out. You dumb fuck.

773
00:47:50.050 --> 00:47:53.050
But I want some emails, people,

774
00:47:53.051 --> 00:47:57.860
I want people try to tell me how,

775
00:47:58.760 --> 00:48:01.370
uh, round and round

776
00:48:04.610 --> 00:48:09.610
[inaudible] maybe tell me the musical validity that that has over like disco,

777
00:48:12.440 --> 00:48:17.150
that all those people probably at Comiskey plaque when they blew up those disco

778
00:48:17.151 --> 00:48:20.750
records, like fucking five, six years later, that's what they were listening to.

779
00:48:22.580 --> 00:48:23.600
<v 4>No buddies.</v>

780
00:48:28.320 --> 00:48:30.650
No. Boom.

781
00:48:31.400 --> 00:48:34.160
<v 1>That was a hit. That was a hit in the 80s</v>

782
00:48:39.220 --> 00:48:43.180
wow. Do I owe my dad an apology?

783
00:48:44.200 --> 00:48:48.640
I just, I was sitting there just one video after the queen's Reich. I mean,

784
00:48:48.641 --> 00:48:53.320
all this stuff that I thought was just fucking unbelievable. You know what?

785
00:48:53.321 --> 00:48:56.080
I'm going to get emails this week. It's like,

786
00:48:57.740 --> 00:48:58.880
I don't know what it's going to be.

787
00:48:58.881 --> 00:49:02.150
It's going to be like people either going to be like, yes, absolutely.

788
00:49:02.300 --> 00:49:04.010
This is going to be, there's going to be no middle ground.

789
00:49:04.280 --> 00:49:07.990
I think we'll be going to 100% agree with me or a,

790
00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:10.100
I'm going to get punched in the face by Eddie Trump.

791
00:49:13.760 --> 00:49:17.630
I just, I was taken aback. I mean,

792
00:49:17.631 --> 00:49:19.640
I've seen those videos and fucking forever.

793
00:49:20.920 --> 00:49:22.880
Occasionally I'll go back and I'll look at some old videos,

794
00:49:22.881 --> 00:49:27.470
but I mean a lot of it was like ac DC like shit. They can like, you know

795
00:49:29.160 --> 00:49:33.230
me back in black is timeless. There's some timeless shit in there. You know,

796
00:49:34.070 --> 00:49:37.370
I even watched that guns and roses, sweet child of mine, I thought,

797
00:49:37.371 --> 00:49:38.510
I thought it was horrible.

798
00:49:39.100 --> 00:49:41.120
<v 11>Whoa.</v>

799
00:49:42.590 --> 00:49:43.423
<v 4>Hi.</v>

800
00:49:43.940 --> 00:49:47.600
<v 1>And that little fucking Shim Sham dance he was doing, it's just was,</v>

801
00:49:49.800 --> 00:49:51.840
oh, and then the emotion he tried to have in the end.

802
00:49:51.920 --> 00:49:52.850
<v 11>Wow.</v>

803
00:49:56.060 --> 00:49:58.160
<v 1>Right. And they kind of closed his eyes like, ah,</v>

804
00:49:58.161 --> 00:50:01.700
I really went somewhere when I've, I was just fucking horrible.

805
00:50:02.870 --> 00:50:07.340
You know, I was right there. I W I helped hold it up. Oh, def Leppard,

806
00:50:07.341 --> 00:50:11.240
pour some sugar, rob me. I hated that when that fucking came out

807
00:50:12.830 --> 00:50:16.460
and all the ladies liked it and he came out in his acid washed jeans.

808
00:50:16.700 --> 00:50:20.330
I actually saw him on that tour, didn't I? Yeah.

809
00:50:20.870 --> 00:50:24.290
Reynolds' Coliseum and Tesla opened up Tesla,

810
00:50:24.291 --> 00:50:26.810
which I didn't think they were that bad. They weren't that bad.

811
00:50:28.730 --> 00:50:29.563
I don't know.

812
00:50:30.020 --> 00:50:33.710
I thought you supposed to go back and listen to the fucking music of, uh,

813
00:50:34.130 --> 00:50:37.580
of your youth being like, wow, that stuff was all, that was awesome, man.

814
00:50:37.800 --> 00:50:41.090
Remember that? And then, you know, that was the first time I tried blow,

815
00:50:41.420 --> 00:50:45.830
you know, reminiscent actually first time I ever saw cocaine,

816
00:50:47.080 --> 00:50:51.680
uh, saw it and saw it being done was, uh,

817
00:50:51.681 --> 00:50:56.240
at the Providence Civic Center. I saw ACDC on the who made,

818
00:50:56.241 --> 00:50:58.070
who tour with loudness,

819
00:50:58.400 --> 00:51:01.550
the Japanese heavy metal band that couldn't speak any English yet,

820
00:51:01.551 --> 00:51:04.250
sang in English. Um,

821
00:51:04.251 --> 00:51:06.610
I just can't imagine the disconnect as sure.

822
00:51:06.680 --> 00:51:11.180
I can't imagine like memorizing a bunch of Japanese and going and over there and

823
00:51:11.181 --> 00:51:15.560
just singing it and then not knowing what the fuck I would say going out there

824
00:51:16.900 --> 00:51:19.970
and everybody, like,

825
00:51:21.650 --> 00:51:25.310
I have no idea what I just said. Tee Shirts at 20 bucks.

826
00:51:25.460 --> 00:51:30.440
Did I just say that or did I say, you ready to rock? I have no fucking idea. Um,

827
00:51:31.550 --> 00:51:33.380
anyways, so I saw them,

828
00:51:33.440 --> 00:51:37.970
they opened up and uh, anyways,

829
00:51:38.110 --> 00:51:40.520
we're out in the parking lot and we're drinking beers. Sticky work,

830
00:51:40.521 --> 00:51:44.150
crazy driving of course, cause it's the 80s.

831
00:51:44.900 --> 00:51:46.010
This is right around before,

832
00:51:46.011 --> 00:51:49.790
right before mad kicked in and they used to bring like records from a fatal

833
00:51:49.791 --> 00:51:52.520
drunk driving accident. Anybody else's high school do that?

834
00:51:53.150 --> 00:51:57.350
They actually brought a car from a fatal drunk driving, uh,

835
00:51:58.130 --> 00:52:02.570
accident dragged onto the lawn of our campus.

836
00:52:03.110 --> 00:52:05.750
We want to call it a campus, a little island with a tree.

837
00:52:06.260 --> 00:52:10.430
They just left it there and we all just stared at it trying to figure out how

838
00:52:10.431 --> 00:52:14.480
many people in the car, how many people died. And then we just walked away.

839
00:52:14.481 --> 00:52:16.430
Like, you know, when you're young, you don't give a fuck.

840
00:52:16.431 --> 00:52:17.810
10 minutes later you're talking about, dude,

841
00:52:17.811 --> 00:52:21.830
I'm getting fucking wrecked tonight. Wrecked that was the word. Get wrecked.

842
00:52:22.120 --> 00:52:25.490
Getting destroyed. Hamot right. So anyways,

843
00:52:26.750 --> 00:52:31.390
we're driving down there. Beer between your legs as you do the eighties,

844
00:52:31.760 --> 00:52:35.060
you know, you fucking lifted weights all that week.

845
00:52:35.090 --> 00:52:38.510
Never all of it above the waist. Curls,

846
00:52:39.720 --> 00:52:44.510
fucking Bension shoulders. Nobody did squats in the 80s nobody did.

847
00:52:44.540 --> 00:52:48.440
Right? So you got your fucking tight five oh one blues on with the Little Pencil

848
00:52:48.441 --> 00:52:52.700
fucking legs. And then you overdeveloped upper body, your stupid gold chain,

849
00:52:53.420 --> 00:52:56.390
and then you had a beer between your legs. That's how you did it.

850
00:52:56.420 --> 00:52:57.680
So we're fucking going down there.

851
00:52:57.681 --> 00:53:02.140
We're probably on eight a piece fucking hammered. Uh,

852
00:53:02.141 --> 00:53:04.700
I was driving this piece of shit, 83 Ford Ranger.

853
00:53:04.701 --> 00:53:07.790
I got like five fucking drunk friends in the back,

854
00:53:07.970 --> 00:53:10.310
which was still not even grounds for getting pulled over.

855
00:53:10.311 --> 00:53:14.090
You could just have people in the back like you were bringing in fucking turkeys

856
00:53:14.091 --> 00:53:16.220
off the slaughter. Nobody gave a shit. Right?

857
00:53:16.970 --> 00:53:21.710
So we pull in and right as I pulled up and I got a parking spot,

858
00:53:22.580 --> 00:53:26.820
there was this kid, he had his door open and kind of like a Sammy Hagar

859
00:53:27.030 --> 00:53:29.610
meets John Fogarty haircut blonde hair.

860
00:53:29.980 --> 00:53:34.020
I remember he fucking did a line right as I was pulling up.

861
00:53:34.770 --> 00:53:38.820
And I fortunately had my window up and he saw me and he saw,

862
00:53:38.821 --> 00:53:43.660
we all had ACDC tee shirts on or whatever and he just got in the car was just

863
00:53:43.830 --> 00:53:44.663
like,

864
00:53:47.240 --> 00:53:50.220
it's like a haunted house right up to the fucking window.

865
00:53:50.760 --> 00:53:54.030
And I was just trying to take it all in like, okay, he just,

866
00:53:54.210 --> 00:53:58.110
how am I supposed to behave around somebody with, with Luzon, coke?

867
00:53:58.350 --> 00:54:01.110
Does this guy have like, you know, Hulk Strength Right now?

868
00:54:01.111 --> 00:54:05.680
Is he going to tip over the truck? Um, anyways, that was the first,

869
00:54:05.750 --> 00:54:07.080
it was the first time I saw blow.

870
00:54:07.830 --> 00:54:11.730
I don't even know what the point of all that was. I was just shocked. Look,

871
00:54:11.760 --> 00:54:16.290
I know it wasn't all bad like the Steve Early Metallica,

872
00:54:16.800 --> 00:54:20.070
you know, right through and justice for all. I know that that stuff was great,

873
00:54:20.910 --> 00:54:25.230
but uh, I'll tell you it is slim. Fucking pickings.

874
00:54:25.231 --> 00:54:27.510
My friends, slim pickings,

875
00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:31.230
<v 3>um, F</v>

876
00:54:31.820 --> 00:54:33.470
<v 1>I don't even, I didn't know what to tell you.</v>

877
00:54:34.010 --> 00:54:34.843
<v 3>Okay.</v>

878
00:54:35.810 --> 00:54:38.950
<v 1>I mean, I even go back sometimes I try to listen to appetite for destruction.</v>

879
00:54:38.960 --> 00:54:42.610
I know that's this watershed fucking moment in that music with some of those

880
00:54:42.611 --> 00:54:43.660
fucking songs,

881
00:54:44.610 --> 00:54:49.560
<v 12>they are out to get me so you can shock me.</v>

882
00:54:50.380 --> 00:54:55.270
<v 1>Take that one to heart and kill yourself. Um,</v>

883
00:54:56.840 --> 00:54:59.050
all right. Don't want to get me a lot of fucking criticism.

884
00:55:00.060 --> 00:55:00.890
<v 3>Okay.</v>

885
00:55:00.890 --> 00:55:03.780
<v 1>The 1980s they'll fuck it.</v>

886
00:55:04.340 --> 00:55:08.450
Eighties did I nail it though, by the way? Everyone had the five oh one blues.

887
00:55:08.480 --> 00:55:12.560
Remember that button? Fly Do washed him three times and you're nuts.

888
00:55:12.561 --> 00:55:14.810
Couldn't breathe. You know,

889
00:55:14.930 --> 00:55:17.720
and you wonder why you've got all these fucking crazy kids that need to be on

890
00:55:17.721 --> 00:55:19.300
drugs now. Hey,

891
00:55:19.310 --> 00:55:24.170
what is worse hair metal or some of that fucking patriotic country music post

892
00:55:24.171 --> 00:55:28.490
nine 11. What is worse to you? What is more cringeworthy?

893
00:55:29.910 --> 00:55:31.230
<v 3>You know, um,</v>

894
00:55:32.530 --> 00:55:36.280
<v 1>shout at the devil or that, that Toby Keith,</v>

895
00:55:36.310 --> 00:55:39.460
Uncle Sam's gonna put a boot in your ass.

896
00:55:40.490 --> 00:55:43.920
<v 3>Ugh. Um, oh my God.</v>

897
00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:49.350
<v 1>Every dime that guy made in that song should've been thrown in his face and then</v>

898
00:55:49.630 --> 00:55:52.860
given to the troops for something else or just,

899
00:55:52.861 --> 00:55:57.800
and then on a partial of it would be to incinerate any record that, that,

900
00:55:57.830 --> 00:55:59.850
that track was ever recorded.

901
00:55:59.940 --> 00:56:04.200
The most pandering horseshit you could ever come out with,

902
00:56:05.220 --> 00:56:08.850
open and Piss you guys off too much by fucking trash and all that metal shit.

903
00:56:09.360 --> 00:56:12.110
You know, I have half those t-shirts and I went to go see that.

904
00:56:12.111 --> 00:56:14.700
I was just embarrassed by some of that shit that I used to listen to.

905
00:56:16.200 --> 00:56:17.033
<v 3>Um,</v>

906
00:56:17.940 --> 00:56:22.320
<v 1>oh Jesus, right up until I was like 2021 fucking brutal. What, what, what,</v>

907
00:56:22.330 --> 00:56:27.240
what redeemable thing that I have. I did listen to the Beatles, the doors,

908
00:56:27.330 --> 00:56:30.330
the stones, all that white boy shit. Stevie Ray Vaughan.

909
00:56:30.420 --> 00:56:31.590
I did listen to Hendrix.

910
00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:36.710
I listened to all the big band swings through my dad shift from the fifties.

911
00:56:38.850 --> 00:56:40.920
Uh, I had such a weird musical upbringing anyways,

912
00:56:40.950 --> 00:56:43.260
which was actually good cause it was kind of all over the map.

913
00:56:45.050 --> 00:56:45.340
<v 3>Um,</v>

914
00:56:45.340 --> 00:56:47.650
<v 1>I started hanging out with Patrice back in the day,</v>

915
00:56:48.290 --> 00:56:51.310
but was the one rest his soul got me the a,

916
00:56:53.150 --> 00:56:56.480
I still remember when he got in that same piece of shit truck that I went to the

917
00:56:56.481 --> 00:57:01.160
ACDC concert and seven fucking years later, I'm still driving it. Right?

918
00:57:01.190 --> 00:57:04.670
Making the sacrifices. Remember that I told you,

919
00:57:04.671 --> 00:57:08.000
you don't get some fucking job and go out and buy a fucking new car.

920
00:57:08.001 --> 00:57:10.490
You just change yourself to your cubicle. I always kept Mike.

921
00:57:10.670 --> 00:57:12.380
I put a new engine in the fucking truck,

922
00:57:13.220 --> 00:57:15.380
had somebody slap that in there for 1200 bucks,

923
00:57:15.381 --> 00:57:19.730
pay that down rather than 12 grand for a new car like it was back then. Um,

924
00:57:19.731 --> 00:57:21.050
so anyways, I still remember,

925
00:57:22.910 --> 00:57:23.743
<v 3>um,</v>

926
00:57:25.100 --> 00:57:28.400
<v 1>swinging by picking Patrice up and going into Knicks and he had the cassette</v>

927
00:57:28.401 --> 00:57:33.390
tape of Ray, uh, ready to die. And him putting that in,

928
00:57:35.310 --> 00:57:37.800
um, telling me that this guy was going to be the next guy.

929
00:57:38.930 --> 00:57:40.280
And then through all of that,

930
00:57:40.281 --> 00:57:45.281
like he cured me of all the rap that a white kid liked who lived in a culdesac.

931
00:57:48.860 --> 00:57:49.693
<v 3>Um,</v>

932
00:57:50.640 --> 00:57:53.680
<v 1>and he showed me all the, all of that shit. So I had that whole background,</v>

933
00:57:53.830 --> 00:57:58.050
all that stuff fucking held up. But the fucking metal that I listened to,

934
00:57:58.440 --> 00:58:00.990
I even watched like Lawrence Welk when I was a kid,

935
00:58:02.300 --> 00:58:05.970
one of the creepiest shows ever. Even that was fucking thrown in there.

936
00:58:07.340 --> 00:58:07.881
It's funny,

937
00:58:07.881 --> 00:58:11.240
like fucking almost 40 years later I'll be walking down the street and all of a

938
00:58:11.241 --> 00:58:16.241
sudden Winchester cathedral will be going through my head when Chester could

939
00:58:16.351 --> 00:58:20.590
take Robo Dododo do eel Brang and made Dow.

940
00:58:20.591 --> 00:58:24.650
And am I really going to sing this? You could have done something Matt

941
00:58:58.000 --> 00:58:58.390
<v 7>[inaudible].</v>

942
00:58:58.390 --> 00:58:59.740
<v 1>Oh my God. Here's one for you guys.</v>

943
00:58:59.980 --> 00:59:03.520
My boyfriend wants to have his four skin restored. By the way,

944
00:59:03.550 --> 00:59:07.240
how fresh and new are these, uh, these emails here?

945
00:59:07.241 --> 00:59:10.360
Just because it's coming from the female perspective. I love this shit.

946
00:59:10.390 --> 00:59:13.040
All right. Not saying I want guys to email him, but I,

947
00:59:13.041 --> 00:59:17.080
I would like to have a nice balance here. I already say enough shit.

948
00:59:17.081 --> 00:59:22.070
Trash and women. So it helps if women come in trash and guys, because a,

949
00:59:22.071 --> 00:59:26.270
I, you know, it'll be a nice balance here. All right.

950
00:59:26.300 --> 00:59:29.810
My boyfriend wants to have his four skin restored. Dear bill,

951
00:59:29.840 --> 00:59:34.450
I wanted to get your take on a situation I'm in with my current boyfriend. Uh,

952
00:59:34.490 --> 00:59:36.920
I'm a girl. All right. A few weeks ago,

953
00:59:37.400 --> 00:59:41.810
my boyfriend of two years told me that he's become totally upset that he's

954
00:59:42.680 --> 00:59:47.680
circumcised and wants to restore his four skin via taping and stretching

955
00:59:48.411 --> 00:59:50.840
methods. What,

956
00:59:53.860 --> 00:59:57.450
and basically why he wants to do this is because everybody, they say that, um,

957
00:59:57.480 --> 01:00:02.370
intercourse you, you lose like, I don't know, some percentage of sensitivity.

958
01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:06.390
Um, when you have your four skin removed. And um,

959
01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:12.360
all I can say is no guy can tell the difference whether he has a four skin or

960
01:00:12.361 --> 01:00:13.194
whether he doesn't.

961
01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:17.160
Because unless you got laid when you were fucking six weeks old,

962
01:00:17.670 --> 01:00:19.680
you don't know what you're gaining or what you're missing.

963
01:00:19.681 --> 01:00:24.630
So I don't understand why you would do this. So by restore his force can,

964
01:00:24.631 --> 01:00:28.230
via taping and stretching methods, she goes, I know, I know.

965
01:00:28.470 --> 01:00:33.390
It makes me want to throw up just thinking about it. I learned to tell him,

966
01:00:33.630 --> 01:00:38.100
I think he's out of his mind. Uh, but I don't want to hurt his feelings.

967
01:00:38.370 --> 01:00:39.091
The thing is,

968
01:00:39.091 --> 01:00:43.920
I'm totally grossed out by the idea of for skin.

969
01:00:44.340 --> 01:00:49.160
Penises are gross enough already. There's no need to make it even grocer.

970
01:00:49.820 --> 01:00:52.890
Uh, you know, what am I the only guy that totally agrees with that?

971
01:00:53.160 --> 01:00:58.160
Is there anything more fucking disgusting than a fucking flacid four skin

972
01:00:58.981 --> 01:00:59.820
covered dick?

973
01:01:03.030 --> 01:01:07.270
I don't even know what it looks like. It looks like a,

974
01:01:07.380 --> 01:01:10.140
I got fucking, I don't know what it looks like.

975
01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:17.400
I, it's just, it's fucking disgusting. I don't even have like a reference.

976
01:01:19.450 --> 01:01:22.560
It's like an elephant Dick. I don't even know what to do. It's just gross.

977
01:01:22.620 --> 01:01:27.060
It's fucking disgusting. Um, she goes,

978
01:01:27.061 --> 01:01:29.010
obviously I can't tell him how I feel.

979
01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:31.950
He's clearly having a really hard time with this.

980
01:01:31.951 --> 01:01:34.920
He tells me that he feels violated and disfigured.

981
01:01:35.550 --> 01:01:39.900
This guy's a pussy. Just throw this, throw this guy into the fucking pussy, Ben,

982
01:01:39.901 --> 01:01:40.920
and get on with your life.

983
01:01:41.250 --> 01:01:45.210
He also claims that four scans has a lot of advantage for both partners,

984
01:01:45.540 --> 01:01:50.540
but it's hard for me to totally buy that considering the fact I have slept with

985
01:01:51.510 --> 01:01:55.530
a couple uncircumcised guy and I didn't notice any extra pleasure.

986
01:01:55.830 --> 01:02:00.030
Although I did use a condom with both guys. Yeah,

987
01:02:00.031 --> 01:02:04.020
he's full of Shit. He's full of Shit. It may be more pleasure for him.

988
01:02:04.620 --> 01:02:05.790
I don't know what I mean.

989
01:02:05.820 --> 01:02:09.540
I think it's amazing that women will put a dick in their mouths. You know?

990
01:02:09.541 --> 01:02:12.360
The least you can do is try and tidy up down there. You know?

991
01:02:12.390 --> 01:02:14.850
How about having a little fucking empathy?

992
01:02:16.440 --> 01:02:16.920
<v 13>Okay.</v>

993
01:02:16.920 --> 01:02:21.060
<v 1>I'm asked just disguise. It's just fucking extra skin. Yeah.</v>

994
01:02:21.061 --> 01:02:25.440
Nothing more sexier than extra skin. Yeah. Yeah.

995
01:02:25.441 --> 01:02:28.500
It's like your Dick used to be obese and then lost a ton of weight,

996
01:02:28.501 --> 01:02:30.990
but didn't have enough money to have that surgery.

997
01:02:32.280 --> 01:02:35.940
They get rid of the extra and that's gross.

998
01:02:37.020 --> 01:02:38.250
There's another two paragraphs,

999
01:02:38.251 --> 01:02:43.251
people just preparing you for another two paragraphs of having an uncircumcised

1000
01:02:43.561 --> 01:02:47.220
stretch taped dick in your head. Anyway,

1001
01:02:47.221 --> 01:02:51.600
I think it's absolutely disgusting and totally weird that he wants to do this

1002
01:02:51.601 --> 01:02:55.470
and I'm starting to get really turned off by the idea of sleeping with him while

1003
01:02:55.471 --> 01:02:57.240
he's stretching out his for skin.

1004
01:02:57.690 --> 01:03:02.370
He told me he's going to tape it to when elastic strap,

1005
01:03:02.970 --> 01:03:05.670
which is going to tie around his leg. I know.

1006
01:03:05.671 --> 01:03:08.400
What the fuck is he just coming up with this shit on his own.

1007
01:03:10.700 --> 01:03:13.460
I told him that he should see a doctor before he starts to do this,

1008
01:03:13.461 --> 01:03:14.294
but he doesn't want,

1009
01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:18.320
but he doesn't think that doctors know much about this sort of thing. Oh,

1010
01:03:18.321 --> 01:03:22.730
so he's just going to take it in his own hands. Ah. Congratulations sweetheart.

1011
01:03:22.760 --> 01:03:24.380
You're dating a fucking moron

1012
01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:32.220
that just come on. This is the father your children coming up with,

1013
01:03:32.221 --> 01:03:34.680
you know, taking an erector set to his fucking Dick.

1014
01:03:34.710 --> 01:03:39.440
It was he this you didn't you do. I have to finish reading this.

1015
01:03:41.140 --> 01:03:44.890
I'm thinking of breaking it off with them really. Course you are.

1016
01:03:45.700 --> 01:03:46.960
I thought he was a normal guy,

1017
01:03:46.961 --> 01:03:50.710
but I had no idea he had all this freaky shit going on underneath the surface.

1018
01:03:51.070 --> 01:03:53.860
Anyways. What do you think about all of this?

1019
01:03:54.310 --> 01:03:56.170
You got to go ll cool j.

1020
01:03:59.560 --> 01:04:01.170
He's got to do what he did.

1021
01:04:02.770 --> 01:04:03.603
<v 7>Okay.</v>

1022
01:04:03.610 --> 01:04:07.900
<v 1>You're stretching out your fucking Dick. I know. I said I'd be true.</v>

1023
01:04:07.930 --> 01:04:12.880
You're stretching out your fucking Dick. So I'm leaving you go fuck yourself.

1024
01:04:12.940 --> 01:04:17.530
It's over. Yeah. Fucking gross.

1025
01:04:18.370 --> 01:04:18.791
Anyway,

1026
01:04:18.791 --> 01:04:22.630
what do you think all this and my justify dumping him away or would that make me

1027
01:04:22.631 --> 01:04:26.740
an insensitive cont no, it would make you a strong person.

1028
01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:32.100
All right. You go with your gut on this one.

1029
01:04:33.470 --> 01:04:33.570
<v 7>Yeah.</v>

1030
01:04:33.570 --> 01:04:38.250
<v 1>This guy is trying to to do the impossible like,</v>

1031
01:04:38.670 --> 01:04:41.220
uh, like he said, fucking scientist in that Michael J,

1032
01:04:41.221 --> 01:04:45.410
Fox movie back to the future. He's basically,

1033
01:04:46.310 --> 01:04:46.641
you know,

1034
01:04:46.641 --> 01:04:50.480
doing the Delorean bullshit with his Dick and he doesn't want to go see a

1035
01:04:50.481 --> 01:04:53.320
doctor. Any doctor would tell him you can't do that.

1036
01:04:54.870 --> 01:04:57.830
It'll be funny though was if you dumped this guy right and it actually works.

1037
01:04:57.890 --> 01:05:01.870
And then he starts screaming like Billy Mays on TB with his,

1038
01:05:01.871 --> 01:05:05.540
his Dick Stretcher and he sells it for 1995.

1039
01:05:06.410 --> 01:05:10.400
It makes a zillion dollar. I'm just playing devil's advocate here. You know

1040
01:05:12.670 --> 01:05:15.420
there's a 99% chance you're doing the right thing,

1041
01:05:15.421 --> 01:05:20.421
but there is a 1% chance you could be walking away from a potential millionaire.

1042
01:05:22.750 --> 01:05:25.960
Cause I gotta be honest with you, if that guy actually pulls this off,

1043
01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:27.190
no pun intended,

1044
01:05:28.200 --> 01:05:33.200
people's this off and he's able to do it with some household material and then

1045
01:05:33.651 --> 01:05:37.770
he, you know, p they, they already make millions of dollars with those,

1046
01:05:37.771 --> 01:05:40.560
those pills that say they're going to make your Dick Bigger,

1047
01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:44.190
which we all know it doesn't work because it fucking work.

1048
01:05:44.191 --> 01:05:47.670
That would be an international story and um,

1049
01:05:47.790 --> 01:05:51.090
and then it still wouldn't work because then what would happen was everybody

1050
01:05:51.091 --> 01:05:52.470
would take big dick pills,

1051
01:05:53.010 --> 01:05:56.340
even guys with big dicks because they don't want everybody else catching up with

1052
01:05:56.341 --> 01:05:56.820
them.

1053
01:05:56.820 --> 01:06:01.820
So then having a little dick would then be like having a six inch dick as

1054
01:06:02.161 --> 01:06:04.290
opposed to a three inch, four inch Dick. Right.

1055
01:06:05.790 --> 01:06:08.510
Does the math work out on that or get bumped up? You've got a six,

1056
01:06:08.511 --> 01:06:12.570
seven inch Dick. You just, you just regular. No, you actually got regular. Yeah,

1057
01:06:12.571 --> 01:06:13.440
you'd have a little Dick.

1058
01:06:15.390 --> 01:06:17.670
So if this guy actually fucking is able to pull this,

1059
01:06:17.671 --> 01:06:19.260
that doesn't even make sense.

1060
01:06:22.470 --> 01:06:24.960
He's going, he, if he thought he was disfigured,

1061
01:06:24.961 --> 01:06:29.490
now wait til he tries to fucking do this. I mean, his Dick is gonna look like,

1062
01:06:29.491 --> 01:06:31.830
you know when those people put that shit, their ear lobes,

1063
01:06:33.610 --> 01:06:38.530
they put those fucking, um, those circles circular things.

1064
01:06:38.531 --> 01:06:42.700
You could shoot a Goddamn fucking bow and Arrow through somebody's ear lobe and

1065
01:06:42.701 --> 01:06:45.430
not drawing any blood. He's going to do that to his deck,

1066
01:06:46.120 --> 01:06:49.150
except he's not going to have that thing in there and it's just going to be hang

1067
01:06:49.151 --> 01:06:51.310
out, right bill? We got it. It's disgusting.

1068
01:06:58.180 --> 01:07:01.010
<v 7>[inaudible] eh?</v>

1069
01:07:05.610 --> 01:07:10.020
[inaudible] eh,

1070
01:07:16.330 --> 01:07:19.790
watching chromes whoa.

1071
01:07:25.690 --> 01:07:29.830
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1072
01:07:41.230 --> 01:07:42.490
[inaudible] can't see you. This

1073
01:07:58.210 --> 01:07:59.043
[inaudible] underrated. Oh,

1074
01:07:59.160 --> 01:08:03.970
way down the rate for this overrated fucking voicemails leaving them as the most

1075
01:08:03.971 --> 01:08:04.804
awkward thing.

1076
01:08:05.230 --> 01:08:08.920
<v 1>I've always said that I'm terrible at leaving them, but whenever I say that,</v>

1077
01:08:08.921 --> 01:08:12.730
everyone else, whenever I say that, everyone else always says it too.

1078
01:08:13.300 --> 01:08:16.130
So I'm putting my foot down on the issue, calling it right now,

1079
01:08:16.131 --> 01:08:18.710
leaving a message for someone on the phone sucks.

1080
01:08:19.230 --> 01:08:22.670
There's no way to start your message normally without sounding like a Douche.

1081
01:08:22.820 --> 01:08:25.820
And then five minutes later you realize you've been trailing on and on while

1082
01:08:25.821 --> 01:08:30.110
saying, uh, um, too many times making you want to kill yourself,

1083
01:08:30.260 --> 01:08:33.020
ending with the inevitable a. Okay, thanks.

1084
01:08:33.500 --> 01:08:37.770
By reminding them that you still do shit. Fucking awful. Do.

1085
01:08:37.771 --> 01:08:41.700
This is something that's really like an epidemic in this young generations.

1086
01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:45.110
Everybody just feeling awkward and feeling like a Douche.

1087
01:08:45.650 --> 01:08:50.120
I Dunno what happened to you guys. I think this last generation of fathers,

1088
01:08:50.150 --> 01:08:52.790
they flipped. Like, I'm not going to beat the shit out of my kid,

1089
01:08:53.180 --> 01:08:58.100
not hog them and never tell them that I, that I, that I love him. Uh, you know,

1090
01:08:58.130 --> 01:09:01.190
I'm going to do all of that shit and you end up with these people who can't even

1091
01:09:01.191 --> 01:09:03.590
fucking leave voicemails.

1092
01:09:05.470 --> 01:09:07.900
What is so awkward? You know,

1093
01:09:10.830 --> 01:09:13.450
I, I, you know, I have a hard time getting off the phone. I forget.

1094
01:09:13.480 --> 01:09:17.280
I forget what I used to say, but I don't feel awkward.

1095
01:09:19.160 --> 01:09:21.260
Well, I just feel like an idiot, I guess. So I guess I kind of relate.

1096
01:09:23.020 --> 01:09:24.640
I just go. All right. That's it. I'm Outta here.

1097
01:09:27.330 --> 01:09:28.163
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1098
01:09:29.700 --> 01:09:32.310
<v 1>I will say that believe in a message. I like leaving messages.</v>

1099
01:09:32.311 --> 01:09:36.030
I sing on people's voicemails. You know,

1100
01:09:36.031 --> 01:09:41.031
whenever I call up fucking blob Bobby Kelly or fucking Joey roses,

1101
01:09:44.010 --> 01:09:47.070
I call him up and I, I'll just immediately, I'll just,

1102
01:09:47.071 --> 01:09:48.780
whatever comes to my mind, I'll just start singing.

1103
01:09:48.960 --> 01:09:52.260
Who's the cunt that I love the most?

1104
01:09:52.950 --> 01:09:57.150
Who's that fucker? Who eats the toast? It's Joey.

1105
01:09:57.450 --> 01:10:02.340
He's such a big fan. Big Derosa. What's going on?

1106
01:10:02.341 --> 01:10:06.690
It's built. Give me a call back. You can't click. That's it.

1107
01:10:06.750 --> 01:10:10.020
Why don't you try singing? You can do it for anybody.

1108
01:10:11.400 --> 01:10:16.380
Hey Mom, what's up you sweetie? Thanks for having me.

1109
01:10:16.381 --> 01:10:20.970
40 years ago I sent you some flowers.

1110
01:10:20.971 --> 01:10:22.230
You didn't call me.

1111
01:10:23.130 --> 01:10:26.610
Do you like my siblings better than me?

1112
01:10:26.760 --> 01:10:30.450
Click right? Why don't you do that? Try that.

1113
01:10:30.690 --> 01:10:34.470
Try singing first. Um, all right. Underrated. Overrated. Underrated.

1114
01:10:34.471 --> 01:10:38.340
Sitting down to p. If you're a guy, uh,

1115
01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:47.440
is it that, how old are you? Is it that hard to stand up?

1116
01:10:49.190 --> 01:10:53.360
What is wrong with this fucking generation of guys? You Know,

1117
01:10:53.361 --> 01:10:54.530
sitting down to pee.

1118
01:10:54.531 --> 01:10:58.530
It's actually easier and you don't get varicose veins from all those years to

1119
01:10:58.770 --> 01:10:59.030
stand.

1120
01:10:59.030 --> 01:11:03.800
There's nothing better than just pulling out your Dick and just fucking pee and

1121
01:11:03.801 --> 01:11:08.630
all over everything. You know, you fucking shooting the toilet paper around.

1122
01:11:08.631 --> 01:11:12.140
It's fucking good time. Um, anyways,

1123
01:11:12.720 --> 01:11:15.300
it says the guy who drives a fucking hybrid. Um, anyways,

1124
01:11:15.301 --> 01:11:18.180
there are many benefits to being a guy in sitting down to peace,

1125
01:11:18.181 --> 01:11:22.470
such as not having to hear your CIC complaint about peeing on the seat,

1126
01:11:22.500 --> 01:11:27.500
even though it's on the fucking top of the ball and it's not actually the seat.

1127
01:11:28.560 --> 01:11:31.150
Yeah. Here's a guy, he, he,

1128
01:11:31.170 --> 01:11:36.000
he's literally sitting down to pee, so his girlfriend will stop yelling at him.

1129
01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:39.840
Okay. I don't know what happened.

1130
01:11:39.841 --> 01:11:42.390
People a hundred years ago,

1131
01:11:42.391 --> 01:11:45.210
we could hit them with mop handles and I dunno what happened.

1132
01:11:45.240 --> 01:11:46.770
They got organized and we didn't,

1133
01:11:46.771 --> 01:11:50.670
and now we're sitting down to pee just so they'll stop yelling at us.

1134
01:11:51.900 --> 01:11:53.640
Um, all right, number two, if you like me,

1135
01:11:53.641 --> 01:11:56.010
if you're like me and you wake up to pee at night,

1136
01:11:56.011 --> 01:12:00.300
you don't have to fuck with your eyes and turn on the bathroom lights to aim.

1137
01:12:01.740 --> 01:12:03.510
Oh Dude, you take it all the fun out of it.

1138
01:12:05.740 --> 01:12:08.410
That's how you train your ear. All right,

1139
01:12:08.411 --> 01:12:10.960
that sounds like the back of the bowl.

1140
01:12:12.040 --> 01:12:15.850
Where's the water? That's the floor. There it is.

1141
01:12:17.170 --> 01:12:20.260
One small step. Um, number three,

1142
01:12:20.261 --> 01:12:23.230
not bending down to lift up the seat out. You know what dude?

1143
01:12:23.231 --> 01:12:27.340
You're a fucking pansy. Not Bending down to clean off the seat.

1144
01:12:27.490 --> 01:12:29.020
Less bending in general.

1145
01:12:29.021 --> 01:12:32.290
Why don't you just bend over and suck your own Dick as you sit on the bowl?

1146
01:12:32.440 --> 01:12:36.880
You fucking Douche. Fuck that guy peeing. Sitting down.

1147
01:12:37.240 --> 01:12:41.650
You know what else sir? What else is overrated?

1148
01:12:42.010 --> 01:12:44.520
Lifting weights. Um,

1149
01:12:46.820 --> 01:12:47.020
<v 7>okay.</v>

1150
01:12:47.020 --> 01:12:51.280
<v 1>Owning a gun. Chewing tobacco. Eating steak. What else?</v>

1151
01:12:51.281 --> 01:12:56.110
Drinking Scotch. Smoking cigars. Fixing your own car.

1152
01:12:56.140 --> 01:12:58.360
What else sir? What else is fucking overrated?

1153
01:12:58.361 --> 01:13:01.960
Everything that makes being a guy fucking awesome. Losing your shit.

1154
01:13:01.961 --> 01:13:06.460
Because some guy you don't know Mr. Field goal that really has no effect on your

1155
01:13:06.461 --> 01:13:10.660
life. Talking Shit. Is that all over rated? Lee Marvin,

1156
01:13:13.400 --> 01:13:16.210
the only thing that saved you surge, you didn't leave your name. So that,

1157
01:13:16.211 --> 01:13:19.390
that's the only thing that I can say is I can at least see that there was sort

1158
01:13:19.391 --> 01:13:21.520
of some, some sort of shame.

1159
