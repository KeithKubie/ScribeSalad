RETO MEIER: This week, neither

00:00:15.218 --> 00:00:17.010
MARY GROVE: We have an
audience question.

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.050
How does that affect the way
you evaluate potential

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.042
investments, especially
at the seed level?

00:00:21.042 --> 00:00:23.934
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:31.740
LOUIS GRAY: Welcome
back to Google

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.720
Developers Live at I/O 2013.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.010
We're setting up for an
exceptional Day Two of

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.860
interviews.

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:38.810
I'm Louis Gray.

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:40.280
I'm here with Daniel Sieberg.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:41.160
DANIEL SIEBERG: Good
morning, Louis.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:41.290
LOUIS GRAY: Thank
you for joining.

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:43.070
DANIEL SIEBERG: Did you go
out last night at all?

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:43.480
LOUIS GRAY: Oh, I don't know.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:44.550
I've been working
this whole time.

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:45.172
DANIEL SIEBERG: Yeah, I know.

00:00:45.172 --> 00:00:45.510
It's true.

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.390
LOUIS GRAY: That's the fun part
of being a part of I/O.

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:48.450
You get to see the excitement.

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.710
All the developers have come
in around the world.

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:52.160
A lot of them are getting
excited about device

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.240
giveaways, new product
announcements, and parties.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.800
DANIEL SIEBERG: Yeah,
absolutely.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.280
Last night was After
Dark, of course.

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.282
I heard the Billy
Idol showed up.

00:00:58.282 --> 00:00:58.480
Is that true?

00:00:58.480 --> 00:00:59.845
LOUIS GRAY: Billy
Idol showed up.

00:00:59.845 --> 00:01:00.250
DANIEL SIEBERG: OK.

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:01.110
LOUIS GRAY: DJ Aoki showed up.

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.690
I was having a little bit of
flashbacks to the early '90s

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.230
when I heard Billy Idol
was going to be there.

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:07.760
But that's a guy who
is really timeless.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:08.850
DANIEL SIEBERG: He really is.

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.410
He seems to have aged
well, somehow.

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:14.180
So let's talk a little
bit about yesterday.

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:15.520
There was so much to digest,

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.930
LOUIS GRAY: Absolutely.

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.370
DANIEL SIEBERG: Over the
course of the keynote.

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:18.515
LOUIS GRAY: A 3 and
1/2 hour keynote.

00:01:18.515 --> 00:01:19.060
DANIEL SIEBERG: Yeah,
3 and 1/2 hours.

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.440
That's a lot of information
for anybody to process.

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.500
And you and I have made about
300 pages of notes on

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.065
everything that we were hearing
throughout the course

00:01:26.065 --> 00:01:26.290
of the day.

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:27.720
LOUIS GRAY: I think we had
enough time yesterday to go

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.630
through like a page and
a half of those notes.

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.425
The only thing about a 3
and 1/2 hour keynote is

00:01:31.425 --> 00:01:32.400
we got to be flex.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.490
It's the fun of live TV and live
streaming is that we got

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.880
crunched down from our
30 minutes of prep

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:38.720
down to like 10.

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:39.550
DANIEL SIEBERG: Yeah, yeah.

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:41.190
LOUIS GRAY: So we want to
definitely take time to look

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.990
at the keynote at hit the big
items that were a big summary

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.440
of the keynote.

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:47.510
Vic Gundotra was up there.

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.190
You had Sundar Pichai,
[? Erj ?].

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:52.960
You had really some incredible
people who are leading the

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.270
next generation of information
discovery, and gadgetry, and

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.210
social, and all this, and
really, some stuff I wanted to

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:00.010
get out of the way.

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.730
DANIEL SIEBERG: Yeah
absolutely.

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:01.870
Let's talk about some
of the numbers we

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:04.755
heard yesterday, too.

00:02:04.755 --> 00:02:06.780
48 billion installs.

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:07.310
LOUIS GRAY: 48 billion.

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.060
DANIEL SIEBERG: With Google
Play, two and a half billion

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.680
in the past month alone.

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.890
900 million installed
Android devices.

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.400
LOUIS GRAY: And that's more than
double from last year.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.600
DANIEL SIEBERG: Right.

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:16.410
LOUIS GRAY: And last year
when we were here,

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:17.400
we were at 400 million.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.220
And I think 100 million
in 2011.

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.650
DANIEL SIEBERG: Yup.

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.110
LOUIS GRAY: And so if you look
at the growth of Android, it's

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.870
just incredible.

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:22.310
DANIEL SIEBERG: Absolutely.

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.750
And Sundar has talked, too,
about the potential beyond

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.620
that, the 5 billion people who
are still not connected to the

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.280
internet around the world,
but will be one day.

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.555
LOUIS GRAY: Yes.

00:02:30.555 --> 00:02:32.800
Now, he put up a slide that
looked at the globe, and you

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.820
could see the number of areas
around the world that had less

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.470
than, I think, 10% penetration
of Android.

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:39.010
DANIEL SIEBERG: Yeah.

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.160
LOUIS GRAY: And you think about
how do you get internet,

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.750
and mobile devices, and all
these things that we take for

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.840
granted to the next 80%?

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:48.700
DANIEL SIEBERG: Yeah, exactly.

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:49.685
LOUIS GRAY: It's really is an
incredible opportunity--

00:02:49.685 --> 00:02:50.450
DANIEL SIEBERG: It's
really exciting.

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:51.460
LOUIS GRAY: --and I'm glad
Google's focused on that.

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.780
DANIEL SIEBERG: Yeah.

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.500
So I'm just going through some
of my notes here, but let's

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.330
talk a little bit
about Android.

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.120
First of all, Android Studio.

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.340
LOUIS GRAY: Yes.

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.910
DANIEL SIEBERG: The development
community, I

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.150
think, really excited
about that.

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:00.850
Almost taking over
from Eclipse--

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:01.180
LOUIS GRAY: Yes.

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.720
DANIEL SIEBERG: --in
some ways?

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.030
LOUIS GRAY: I saw some
interesting feedback.

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.620
One of the great things about
Google+, is you can see your

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.890
friends talk about the keynote
practically in real time.

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.800
And one of my friends was
talking about it, saying even

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.270
at a 0.1 release, Android
Studio is a significant

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:16.290
alternative to Eclipse.

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:17.650
He is very excited about that.

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.910
DANIEL SIEBERG: Yeah.

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.965
LOUIS GRAY: I watched that get
rolled out in the pre-roll the

00:03:20.965 --> 00:03:21.860
day before.

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.280
And it was exceptionally
exciting to see how they could

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.760
take things that traditionally
are complex, things like

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.170
taking an Android app and
fitting it across multiple

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.895
different phone sizes.

00:03:30.895 --> 00:03:33.890
How do you code for something
that not only looks well in a

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:36.600
3.7-inch phone, but like
an 8-inch phone?

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:37.560
DANIEL SIEBERG: Or
a 10 inch even.

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.280
I mean, the response from people
in the audience, I

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:41.900
think, said it all.

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.130
The cheers that came up when
people were talking about that

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.790
cross-platform cross-device
kind of integration.

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.900
And the demo that was done
was fascinating.

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.120
And also we should talk about
the games services as well

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.800
that was announced.

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.050
LOUIS GRAY: Yes.

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:56.650
DANIEL SIEBERG: But to see that
ability to play a game

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.250
across devices like that, as
a long-time gamer, it was

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:00.185
amazing to me.

00:04:00.185 --> 00:04:02.630
LOUIS GRAY: I think everybody
has had that situation where,

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:04.330
you knock out a high score
on your phone.

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.150
You get home, you open up your
Nexus 7, you're like.

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:07.310
I don't wan to hit
this level again.

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:07.550
DANIEL SIEBERG: Yeah.

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:08.560
LOUIS GRAY: I know this level.

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:09.470
I mean, I could do it again.

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.840
DANIEL SIEBERG: I'm
sure I saved it.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:10.020
Why is this happening?

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:11.420
LOUIS GRAY: But I want to
have that high score.

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.650
DANIEL SIEBERG: Yup.

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:12.630
LOUIS GRAY: And you have
to remember which

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:13.250
device you're on.

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.104
You're like, well, I actually
did better on my phone than I

00:04:15.104 --> 00:04:15.320
did on my tablet.

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:15.700
DANIEL SIEBERG: Right, right.

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:17.310
LOUIS GRAY: I think a lot of
that's going away, especially

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.120
when you tie it into Google+
and your social graph.

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.249
You know how your friends
are doing.

00:04:21.249 --> 00:04:22.760
You know how you're doing.

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:26.170
And it's really kind of the next
generation of multiplayer

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:27.525
gaming across devices.

00:04:27.525 --> 00:04:28.520
DANIEL SIEBERG: Yeah,
absolutely.

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:32.560
And then also within that, of
course, the All Access music

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.850
service, which I think a lot of
people are excited about,

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:37.450
the ability not only to stream
songs, but to create your own

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:41.170
playlists, radio stations,
essentially, and to upload up

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:44.550
to 20,000 songs of your own
content to store as well.

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:46.690
LOUIS GRAY: What really struck
me when the team was talking

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:49.270
about that is really kind of a
mix and match, the best of

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:50.070
both worlds.

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:53.190
We've had the option for a while
to have the music locker

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:55.270
where you could take all of your
tunes, wherever you had

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.390
them from, and put them
into the cloud.

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:58.605
And access them on any device.

00:04:58.605 --> 00:05:01.560
Well, what was really missing
was connecting it first to the

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.320
Google Play Store, which
happened last year, so you

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:05.980
could tap into that library, and
then second, having that

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:08.270
streaming option, where
you can really build a

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:09.540
radio based on a song.

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:12.300
You hear a fresh track, and
you want to hit it and say

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.290
what else is going on that
I don't have yet?

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:14.705
DANIEL SIEBERG: Yeah,
and it's essentially

00:05:14.705 --> 00:05:16.450
like an infinite playlist.

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:17.630
More music comes in.

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:18.440
You can look ahead.

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:21.140
I love the interface where you
can actually swipe a song out

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:22.852
of the way if you want to look
ahead and don't want

00:05:22.852 --> 00:05:23.560
to listen to it.

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:24.130
LOUIS GRAY: And we've
seen that.

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:25.270
You have other streaming
services.

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:26.270
You're like, gack!

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:27.420
How did that song get
on my playlist?

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:28.900
And you kind of hit
it to go way.

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:29.890
And that's good that's there.

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:31.620
And that was at $9.99
a month, right?

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:32.080
DANIEL SIEBERG: Right,
exactly.

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:32.610
And although you can--

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:36.850
I think you can sign up in
advance for $7.99 through to

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:37.350
the end of June.

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:38.380
So that's a pretty good deal.

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:39.780
LOUIS GRAY: Sure.

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:42.030
DANIEL SIEBERG: Google Maps, I
think, got a lot of attention

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:46.190
here, and rightly so, and
amazing refresh and re-design

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:49.270
to the tool we now call the
classic Google Maps but is now

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:51.520
the new Google Maps.

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.790
The fact that you're able to get
this vector-based amazing

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:59.240
experience, the way that you
look at the Maps experience is

00:05:59.240 --> 00:05:59.890
totally different.

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:01.590
I mean, you see the search
bar on the top left.

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:04.530
You see more of the map itself,
the suggestions from

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:07.650
your friends on places to
go to, all of that.

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:08.640
Amazing on desktop.

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:09.990
We saw it previewed on mobile.

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:10.460
LOUIS GRAY: Right.

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:12.660
DANIEL SIEBERG: Hopefully
coming soon.

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:14.750
LOUIS GRAY: We've been talking
about this for two years now,

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:17.180
with Google+ as the social layer
that's improving all the

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:18.390
different applications.

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:21.040
You look at Maps, and if you
have a significant number of

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:23.430
reviews, it's really going to
impact the way that you

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:24.290
display in a map.

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:26.570
If you have a place, and it's
gotten so many reviews, and

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:28.890
people have given it a certain
grade, like through the Zagat

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:32.830
scores and all that, I often
find that when I'm traveling,

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:35.240
I'm not going to be the expert
of restaurants in an area.

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:38.560
I often make silly mistakes,
like going to a national chain

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:40.430
when I get to a new place when
I really could have gone the

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:42.490
next level and found
something cool.

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:45.490
And with recommendations from my
friends in new places, now

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:47.200
that's where Maps can really
take off and have a

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:47.990
difference.

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:50.430
I think we've seen a lot of
coverage in the last year or

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:53.770
two about the importance
of getting Maps right.

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:56.810
And having Google Maps on every
device, be it in your

00:06:56.810 --> 00:07:00.210
car, or on your phone, or
in your Glass, all these

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:02.480
different things, it really is
a difference maker in making

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:03.940
sure you have the right
information that gets you

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:04.740
there at the right time.

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:05.000
DANIEL SIEBERG: Yeah.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.920
I've worked a lot
with Geo folks.

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:10.410
And as you know, they have
spent years refining and

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:13.380
making these maps more accurate
and more useful.

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:14.660
LOUIS GRAY: And that's
not easy-- or cheap.

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:16.780
DANIEL SIEBERG: It's
a mammoth task.

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:18.300
Yeah, exactly.

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:20.260
And they've done
an amazing job.

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:23.560
Let's also talk about Search,
because that has been much

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:25.530
more sort of closely integrated
in some ways with

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:27.240
the Maps experience.

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:29.930
And we saw that Amit was
up there talking about

00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:31.030
conversational search.

00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:31.510
LOUIS GRAY: Yes.

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:32.120
DANIEL SIEBERG: This is
something that I think--

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:33.010
LOUIS GRAY: And [? Johan. ?]

00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:34.920
Amit [? and Johan ?] did
a great job up there.

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:35.170
DANIEL SIEBERG: Yup.

00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:37.560
And the idea that you can
actually just talk to your

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:40.190
computer essentially, and say,
OK, Google, ask it what you

00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:43.090
want, without even having to
tap on the microphone.

00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:44.120
LOUIS GRAY: We had
[? Barish ?]

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:45.670
come up here yesterday to
talk about Google Now.

00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:47.570
And Google Now has been
transformative to find the

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:49.870
information that you want,
even without you asking.

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:53.167
They called it Assist,
and basically take

00:07:53.167 --> 00:07:54.160
you to the next level.

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:56.670
And you look at that inside your
browser, and she did a

00:07:56.670 --> 00:07:59.120
demo saying, how far
is it from here?

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:01.440
And when you say how far is
"it," what is it referring to?

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:02.750
How far is here?

00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:04.290
And it referred to the
previous discussion.

00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:04.650
You're almost having a

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:06.580
conversation with your browser.

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:09.490
And the demo went off without
a hitch and talked about how

00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:11.310
long it takes to get down to
Santa Cruz, like an hour and

00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:13.280
21 minutes for 72 miles.

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:14.920
And just the idea of talking
to your computer.

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:16.680
You know, we talked about
this yesterday.

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:17.820
I know you've got young kids.

00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:18.970
I've got young kids.

00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:21.380
And my children really think
that they should be able to

00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:24.000
get any piece of information
that they want out of any

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.430
device at any time--

00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:25.980
instantly.

00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:28.880
You know, my daughter's holding
up her Nexus 7 and

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:30.600
saying, show me videos
of sea turtles.

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:31.220
DANIEL SIEBERG: Yeah,
You see, it's the

00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:33.000
on-demand generation, really.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.370
They want it when
they want it.

00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:35.640
LOUIS GRAY: They
just expect it.

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:36.960
They'll hold it up
and say, show me

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:38.500
pictures of daddy, right?

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:40.220
And there's going to come a time
where Google understands,

00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:42.330
oh, this is Sarah talking,
and when daddy, it

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:43.220
refers to this guy.

00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:44.440
And that'll come.

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:45.270
I really believe that.

00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:46.365
And it's kind of fun.

00:08:46.365 --> 00:08:47.890
They expect it to be there.

00:08:47.890 --> 00:08:49.870
And they should be able
to talk to their TV,

00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:50.630
Google TV at home.

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:52.880
They'll pick up the remote
and talk to it.

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:54.880
And it's really fun to
see that develop.

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:57.890
And we've gone from a world of,
hey, that would be nice.

00:08:57.890 --> 00:09:00.550
And we saw it on "Star Trek",
like Amit is talking about, to

00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:02.360
really realizing that
we're living in the

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:03.060
future right now.

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:03.400
DANIEL SIEBERG: Yeah.

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:05.210
I loved that "Star Trek" analogy
because I think that

00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:07.500
really resonates with people,
especially those of us who

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:09.820
grew up watching sci-fi, the
fact that you could just

00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:12.600
interact with it in that very
seamless way, that you find

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:14.180
and get what you want
very quickly.

00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:16.106
And then the technology sort of
gets out of your way, and

00:09:16.106 --> 00:09:17.310
you can carry on with
what you want to do.

00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:18.460
LOUIS GRAY: And that's something
that's been a big

00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:20.570
aspect of a lot of Google
services lately.

00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:22.050
You talk about Chrome.

00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:23.820
And people say why is
it called Chrome?

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:27.600
And in design, people often
called the stuff around the

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:31.620
browser "chrome," be it the
navigation bar, the sidebar,

00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:32.850
the scroll bar.

00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:35.810
And with Chrome, it was just to
get that out of the way, to

00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:38.480
get the technology and the
browser out of your way.

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:39.820
And you look at the Pixel.

00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:41.560
Both of us are lucky enough to
have Pixels in front of us

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:43.870
today, incredible screen
resolution.

00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:46.830
But they said you should never
have to see another Pixel.

00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:48.100
And they're serious
about that.

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:49.880
And if you can get the Chrome
out of the way, you get the

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:52.140
Pixel out of the way, there
should be nothing standing

00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:54.590
between you and the information
and the people you

00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:56.270
want to connect to
immediately.

00:09:56.270 --> 00:09:56.900
DANIEL SIEBERG: Yup, exactly.

00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:59.300
And speaking of the Pixel, as
you mentioned they're right

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:00.120
here in front of us.

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:02.830
All of the attendees here got
one, which was obviously very

00:10:02.830 --> 00:10:03.710
exciting for them.

00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:06.020
They're all floating around
here today as people are

00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:07.960
checking them out, and as you
say, discovering the amazing

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:09.430
screen resolution
with it, too.

00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:11.325
LOUIS GRAY: And we actually have
the team, Chris Lyons and

00:10:11.325 --> 00:10:13.220
Andrew [? Rogers ?] are going
to be coming here this

00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:14.650
afternoon to talk
about the Pixel.

00:10:14.650 --> 00:10:15.860
We are going to do
a deep dive.

00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:17.670
We actually have an incredible
lineup for today, which we are

00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:20.460
going to get to, which goes even
further than yesterday, I

00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:23.370
believe, not only in the terms
of number of sessions, but the

00:10:23.370 --> 00:10:25.170
incredible people who
we're going to have.

00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:27.450
Everyone from Bradley Horowitz,
vice president on

00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:31.990
Google+, to Hugo Barra from
Android and Hiroshi Lockheimer

00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:33.590
who are just doing an
incredible job.

00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:35.250
And we'll get to that.

00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:37.210
But I want to talk a little bit
more about the keynote,

00:10:37.210 --> 00:10:39.870
one of the things that really
struck me that Google's been

00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:40.590
talking about.

00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:42.910
We see it often because
we're internal, right?

00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:45.130
We get to understand how Google
works and see how the

00:10:45.130 --> 00:10:46.750
different products
come together.

00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:50.090
And it's really an opportunity
at I/O for the covers to be

00:10:50.090 --> 00:10:50.820
pulled back.

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:53.820
And for the developers and the
rest of the world to see how

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:56.280
we're thinking and why we're
doing what we're doing.

00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:59.450
How are we moving away from
a world where we have many

00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:02.770
different product areas that
possibly ship independently

00:11:02.770 --> 00:11:05.155
and do their own thing to
something that is one Google

00:11:05.155 --> 00:11:07.030
and it all comes together?

00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:09.420
And one of the things I really
enjoyed was to really focus on

00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:12.510
the fact that you should have
a unified experience on your

00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:16.030
mobile device, on your tablet,
on your desktop.

00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:17.410
It really should be
no different.

00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:20.320
And there were a number of
things that clearly stuck out

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:20.920
to me on that.

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:22.780
First let's start
with Google+.

00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:25.980
Google+ had a complete redesign
of their interface,

00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:27.060
which is really exciting.

00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:27.800
DANIEL SIEBERG: Yeah,
I've been messing

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:28.430
around with it already.

00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:29.260
I'm sure you have, too.

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:30.330
LOUIS GRAY: Absolutely.

00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:32.440
We get to enjoy some of these
things ahead of time.

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:34.820
I enjoy having it on my consumer
account now and be

00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:37.670
able to see all my photos
looking beautiful, to be able

00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:39.880
to see things that are
horizontal take up the entire

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:43.920
page, to have really smart
hashtags that can discover new

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:45.705
information for me that I
wasn't even looking for.

00:11:45.705 --> 00:11:46.800
DANIEL SIEBERG: Yeah, that's the
idea of related hashtags

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:47.290
that they talked about.

00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:48.340
LOUIS GRAY: Yes.

00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:49.770
DANIEL SIEBERG: And then the way
that the cards will flip

00:11:49.770 --> 00:11:51.760
around within your stream.

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:52.640
LOUIS GRAY: They talked
about bringing depth.

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:54.370
Today most social networks
are flat.

00:11:54.370 --> 00:11:54.970
You read it.

00:11:54.970 --> 00:11:56.860
You read it from top to bottom,
and that's how it is.

00:11:56.860 --> 00:11:59.490
And the new Google+, it really
kind of brings another level

00:11:59.490 --> 00:12:01.000
of depth of field.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.130
And the photo experience,
the auto enhancement--

00:12:04.130 --> 00:12:06.470
the auto awesome, is what
they call it-- is really

00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:07.180
incredible.

00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:10.610
But where I was going with that
is Google+ looks the same

00:12:10.610 --> 00:12:12.220
on mobile and desktop.

00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:15.190
It's no longer a situation where
you have a mobile team

00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:16.820
and you have a desktop team.

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:18.980
And maybe the mobile device
looks even better than the

00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:21.590
desktop or vice versa, and you
wonder which features are on

00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:22.300
which device.

00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:23.290
It should all just flow.

00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:25.660
And so on the mobile device, and
on the desktop, and on the

00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:28.480
tablet, you have the same
rich experience.

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:30.250
DANIEL SIEBERG: And within that,
as you mentioned the

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:32.620
seamless integration of all of
these different services and

00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:35.470
devices, Hangouts now bring
together all of those

00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:36.500
different ways of communicating

00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:37.560
with Chat and Talk.

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:40.530
And so it is a much
more integrated

00:12:40.530 --> 00:12:41.220
experience with all that.

00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:42.440
LOUIS GRAY: And Hangouts is an
interesting thing that you

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:42.880
mentioned that.

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:46.790
You look at text, photos, video,
three totally different

00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:48.860
things where, previously,
you were always

00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:49.810
looking at which app.

00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:52.260
If I'm going to go to photos,
I have an app for that.

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:53.722
If I'm going to have
video, I'm going to

00:12:53.722 --> 00:12:54.740
do something else.

00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:57.670
And what Hangouts has done,
it's not just a simple

00:12:57.670 --> 00:12:58.160
re-branding.

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:01.070
It's a whole technology refresh
to take the little

00:13:01.070 --> 00:13:03.750
pieces that we had together in
the messaging world and bring

00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:04.940
them together as one.

00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:07.430
And so you no longer have to
think about, maybe this

00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:08.600
person is on OS.

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:10.150
Maybe they're on Android.

00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:11.970
Maybe this does filtering
better.

00:13:11.970 --> 00:13:14.020
It's really all about bringing
all the conversation you have

00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:15.890
in one place across devices.

00:13:15.890 --> 00:13:18.580
You can see where somebody
is in a conversation.

00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:19.940
This person's right
up to here.

00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:22.270
You can see who's actively
typing and engaging in a group

00:13:22.270 --> 00:13:24.860
chat, and it makes it alive
on all your devices.

00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:28.240
So I can start a discussion on
my Pixel, close it, and then

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:31.190
go over to my Android device and
really see that come up.

00:13:31.190 --> 00:13:33.190
DANIEL SIEBERG: As you know,
Hangouts are used by us

00:13:33.190 --> 00:13:35.300
internally, of course, for
meetings all the time.

00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:37.030
But from a personal standpoint,
they are

00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:39.290
indispensable for me when
I'm on the road.

00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:40.140
We talked about having kids.

00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:42.360
I mean, I think my daughter's
growing up understanding that

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:45.830
once in a while daddy's in the
computer, and that ability to

00:13:45.830 --> 00:13:47.850
kind of do that anywhere,
anytime.

00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:50.100
I've done a mobile Hangout
with my daughter.

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:51.680
It's really, really
cool stuff.

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:53.520
LOUIS GRAY: You know, Hangouts
is really transformative.

00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:55.690
What's cool about it,
I recently did

00:13:55.690 --> 00:13:56.910
a trip out to Europe.

00:13:56.910 --> 00:13:59.400
And silly me, I didn't set up my
mobile phone in such a way

00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:00.660
that I had 4G access.

00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:02.050
You get there, and good luck.

00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:05.210
All you got is Wi-Fi,
but that was fine.

00:14:05.210 --> 00:14:08.440
We're living in a world where
you don't always need to have

00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:09.600
that type of voice capability.

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:11.960
I went to my computer and
fired up a Hangout.

00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:15.570
And every single day, I spoke
to my kids face to face.

00:14:15.570 --> 00:14:16.840
And we had that type
of relationship.

00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:18.270
I did it last night.

00:14:18.270 --> 00:14:20.420
After we wrapped up here,
at 7 o'clock--

00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:21.950
great range of shows--

00:14:21.950 --> 00:14:24.330
I went back to the hotel,
fired up Wi-Fi and

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:25.100
talked to my kids.

00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:26.310
And I could see them running
around making

00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:27.780
a mess in my office.

00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:29.130
And really talked to
them and said, hey,

00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:30.060
here's what I'm doing.

00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:31.680
And they could see me
and talk back to me.

00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:34.100
And I could tell them to shape
up, and go to bed, and do all

00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:36.560
those things you do as a
parent, face to face.

00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:37.220
And that's really
transformative.

00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:38.540
DANIEL SIEBERG: It
is very powerful.

00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:41.400
My parents live in
Canada, actually.

00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:43.790
They've actually participated
in her birthday parties via

00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:45.980
Hangout, just sitting and
watching and kind of feeling

00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:47.630
like they're virtually there,
which I think is really

00:14:47.630 --> 00:14:49.000
special for them.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:49.870
So speaking of Google+--

00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:50.960
LOUIS GRAY: Yes.

00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:52.200
DANIEL SIEBERG: --we
are actually right

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:52.930
next door to the--

00:14:52.930 --> 00:14:53.240
LOUIS GRAY: Where?

00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:54.250
DANIEL SIEBERG: --Google+
sandbox.

00:14:54.250 --> 00:14:56.220
LOUIS GRAY: I think i saw Vic
walking around here taking a

00:14:56.220 --> 00:14:56.790
look at us earlier.

00:14:56.790 --> 00:14:57.840
DANIEL SIEBERG: Yeah, exactly.

00:14:57.840 --> 00:14:58.560
LOUIS GRAY: The team is close.

00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:00.100
DANIEL SIEBERG: They're talking
a lot about Auto

00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:02.440
Enhance, and as you say, Auto
Awesome, and the new Hangouts,

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:04.570
and the new UI, and
all of that stuff.

00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:06.810
And so I did get a chance
yesterday to talk to some of

00:15:06.810 --> 00:15:07.710
the partners who were there.

00:15:07.710 --> 00:15:09.970
There were quite a number
of them, we should say.

00:15:09.970 --> 00:15:11.410
But we got a chance to
talk to about four.

00:15:11.410 --> 00:15:13.870
LOUIS GRAY: And I think today
is a big day for Google+ for

00:15:13.870 --> 00:15:16.690
GDL at I/O. In addition, we're
going to talk about the

00:15:16.690 --> 00:15:19.320
sandbox and the partners that
you spoke with really soon.

00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:21.750
But we actually have
back-to-back interviews today.

00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:24.370
Bradley Horowitz is going
to be on our stage.

00:15:24.370 --> 00:15:27.380
I believe that's at
11:45 or 11:55.

00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:29.030
He's going to come on
for a half hour.

00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:30.830
And then we're going to talk
with Seth Sternberg, behind

00:15:30.830 --> 00:15:32.850
Google+ Sign In, for an
additional 20 minutes.

00:15:32.850 --> 00:15:35.090
So we're going to have a
back-to-back session with

00:15:35.090 --> 00:15:37.300
Google+ on GDL at I/O.

00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:39.410
But before that, definitely we
want to talk a little bit

00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:42.750
about those partners that you
saw at the Google+ sandbox.

00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:45.080
A unique opportunity here at
Google I/O is to bring those

00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:47.640
developers in around the world
and put them in one place.

00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:49.010
So what is it that
they're doing?

00:15:49.010 --> 00:15:51.480
I mean, Google+ is still pretty
new when it comes to

00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:54.410
developers tapping into an
API, working on Sign In.

00:15:54.410 --> 00:15:55.660
What did you see when
you were there?

00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:57.170
DANIEL SIEBERG: I think the
Google+ Sign In aspect was a

00:15:57.170 --> 00:15:59.140
big part of what they're working
on and integrating

00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:02.040
that into what they
already have.

00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:05.000
The partners that I talked to,
Fandango, which everybody

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.600
knows is a movie ticket website;
Mashable, which is

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:09.340
this great news and information
website that

00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:13.040
covers a lot of different
subjects; Voxie, which is a

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:16.800
neat way of learning another
language; and then Jolicloud,

00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:19.990
which is a way of actually
finding and kind of collecting

00:16:19.990 --> 00:16:23.450
and seeing all of your
cloud-based content in one

00:16:23.450 --> 00:16:24.600
particular interface.

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:27.580
So anyway, they've really
done some great stuff.

00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:30.520
I think that they're pushing
the envelope in terms of

00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:33.550
thinking about Sign In,
but also Hangouts.

00:16:33.550 --> 00:16:35.620
I don't want to give anything
away as we get into it.

00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:37.870
But they've really done
some amazing stuff.

00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:38.130
LOUIS GRAY: Cool.

00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:41.030
So why don't we go ahead and run
the video that we recorded

00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:43.910
yesterday and see what Daniel
Sieberg experienced in the

00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:45.914
Google+ sandbox.

00:16:45.914 --> 00:16:51.520
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:51.830
DANIEL SIEBERG: Hi, there.

00:16:51.830 --> 00:16:55.050
I'm Daniel Sieberg with Google
Developers Live at I/O 2013.

00:16:55.050 --> 00:16:59.020
And we are at the Google+
sandbox to talk to a number of

00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:00.380
different partners here.

00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:02.860
We're going to start by
talking to these guys.

00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:04.109
If you can't tell, that's
an F for Fandango.

00:17:04.109 --> 00:17:06.900
And I'm joined right now
by Jad from Fandango.

00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:08.609
Jad, welcome.

00:17:08.609 --> 00:17:11.619
So Fandango people know
for movie tickets.

00:17:11.619 --> 00:17:14.560
But how is it tying into
Google+ and that social

00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:15.319
experience?

00:17:15.319 --> 00:17:15.819
JAD SANTOS: Sure.

00:17:15.819 --> 00:17:18.618
We just recently launched
integration with Google+.

00:17:18.618 --> 00:17:20.920
So let me just walk you
through some of the--

00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:21.069
DANIEL SIEBERG: OK.

00:17:21.069 --> 00:17:21.599
JAD SANTOS: --stuff
we've done.

00:17:21.599 --> 00:17:22.119
DANIEL SIEBERG: Great.

00:17:22.119 --> 00:17:28.140
JAD SANTOS: So on the homepage,
you can now go to a

00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:29.010
movie page.

00:17:29.010 --> 00:17:32.550
And from this movie page,
you can watch a

00:17:32.550 --> 00:17:35.130
trailer right here.

00:17:35.130 --> 00:17:39.220
And by watching that trailer,
it records an activity onto

00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:40.890
your Google+ stream.

00:17:40.890 --> 00:17:42.490
DANIEL SIEBERG: So it shows up
in my stream that I've watched

00:17:42.490 --> 00:17:43.230
the trailer?

00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:43.630
JAD SANTOS: Yeah.

00:17:43.630 --> 00:17:44.030
DANIEL SIEBERG: OK.

00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:44.430
JAD SANTOS: Right.

00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:47.970
And once you've watched the
trailer and decided, oh, this

00:17:47.970 --> 00:17:48.620
is a good movie.

00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:50.440
Let's go watch the movie.

00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:52.520
I can click Buy Tickets.

00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:56.240
And from there, I can invite my
friends, the Metreon's just

00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:57.860
across the street.

00:17:57.860 --> 00:18:00.880
So inviting friends is as easy
as hovering over this and

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:02.680
clicking Google+.

00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:07.200
And it will show my friends what
I'm about to watch, and

00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:08.590
if they want to join
me they can.

00:18:08.590 --> 00:18:08.690
DANIEL SIEBERG: So what
happens if they

00:18:08.690 --> 00:18:11.130
click on Join Me?

00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:13.540
JAD SANTOS: I will be able
to see that, and we can

00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:14.270
coordinate our tickets.

00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:14.900
DANIEL SIEBERG: All
show up together.

00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:15.910
JAD SANTOS: Buying
together, yeah.

00:18:15.910 --> 00:18:16.940
DANIEL SIEBERG: Very cool.

00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:19.160
JAD SANTOS: I'll share that.

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:24.975
And once that's shared, you can
go to your Google+ stream

00:18:24.975 --> 00:18:26.424
and refresh this.

00:18:26.424 --> 00:18:28.839
Actually, it's already shown
up there already.

00:18:28.839 --> 00:18:32.230
So it shows up right in the
middle, which is great.

00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:33.240
DANIEL SIEBERG: That's great.

00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:36.670
And so let's talk a little
bit the developer side.

00:18:36.670 --> 00:18:39.750
What has it been like to work
with the Google+ folks to

00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:40.670
integrate all of this?

00:18:40.670 --> 00:18:41.580
JAD SANTOS: It's been
really great.

00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:45.750
They're really had a lot
of ideas for us, and we

00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:48.960
integrated most of them
for the launch today.

00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:52.830
And all throughout the
development process, they've

00:18:52.830 --> 00:18:54.180
been there locking steps.

00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:57.156
So we've had a lot
of help from them

00:18:57.156 --> 00:18:58.134
getting all of this done.

00:18:58.134 --> 00:19:00.090
And we couldn't have done
it without them.

00:19:00.090 --> 00:19:01.590
DANIEL SIEBERG: And what about
the mobile aspect?

00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:03.510
I assume that a lot of you are
thinking a lot about people

00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:04.660
obviously, out on
their devices.

00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:05.030
JAD SANTOS: Yeah.

00:19:05.030 --> 00:19:08.480
Just like they announced on the
keynote today that you can

00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:10.710
have an automatic over-the-air
install.

00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:14.830
So going to here, if my friends
see that I'm going to

00:19:14.830 --> 00:19:17.130
the movies with Fandango, if
it's not already on their

00:19:17.130 --> 00:19:21.190
phone and they interact with
me, it will automatically

00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:23.380
install the Fandango
app on their phone.

00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:24.050
DANIEL SIEBERG: Great, Jad.

00:19:24.050 --> 00:19:25.070
Thank you so much.

00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:26.854
I feel like going to watch a
movie right now or something.

00:19:26.854 --> 00:19:27.328
JAD SANTOS: I hope so.

00:19:27.328 --> 00:19:27.564
DANIEL SIEBERG: Thank you.

00:19:27.564 --> 00:19:28.276
It's been a pleasure.

00:19:28.276 --> 00:19:29.698
JAD SANTOS: Thank you.

00:19:29.698 --> 00:19:35.400
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:37.680
DANIEL SIEBERG: All right now,
we're on to the letter M, and

00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:39.210
that's M for Mashable.

00:19:39.210 --> 00:19:41.110
And I'm joined right now by
Robyn Peterson, who is the

00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:42.146
Chief Technology Officer--

00:19:42.146 --> 00:19:42.512
ROBYN PETERSON: That's right.

00:19:42.512 --> 00:19:42.880
DANIEL SIEBERG: --at Mashable.

00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:45.420
So folks know Mashable as a site
to get all sorts of news

00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:46.450
and information.

00:19:46.450 --> 00:19:49.310
But from the social standpoint,
what are you doing

00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:52.960
with Google+ in terms of
curating stories and actually

00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:54.090
acknowledging some of
the people who are

00:19:54.090 --> 00:19:55.340
part of this process?

00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:55.520
ROBYN PETERSON: Sure.

00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:57.740
So we actually view ourselves
as the most social news site

00:19:57.740 --> 00:19:58.620
on the web.

00:19:58.620 --> 00:20:00.630
We generate a lot of our stories
based upon what's

00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:02.250
happening in internet
culture, right?

00:20:02.250 --> 00:20:04.120
And a lot of the conversation
about internet culture

00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:05.440
obviously happens on
social networks.

00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:08.440
So it behooves us really to tie
our article pages, where

00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:11.040
we tell our stories, into the
social networks on which

00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:11.470
they're discussed.

00:20:11.470 --> 00:20:12.000
DANIEL SIEBERG: Yup.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:13.440
ROBYN PETERSON: So what we did
with the integration with

00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:17.540
Google+ is, we, of course, have
our Google+ share button.

00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:22.890
If a user clicks on this, they
can obviously share a story

00:20:22.890 --> 00:20:24.760
directly from here.

00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:27.325
So I love this new Google
Maps announcement.

00:20:27.325 --> 00:20:28.053
DANIEL SIEBERG: Yup.

00:20:28.053 --> 00:20:31.330
ROBYN PETERSON: When I
share it through--

00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:32.660
DANIEL SIEBERG: So that shows
up in their stream.

00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:34.030
ROBYN PETERSON: --it will show
up right in their stream.

00:20:34.030 --> 00:20:36.050
If I follow this person
now, I'm actually

00:20:36.050 --> 00:20:37.130
not the curator anymore.

00:20:37.130 --> 00:20:38.780
Now I'm one of their
followers.

00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:41.590
So I see that person's stream,
and I say great.

00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:42.850
I would love to see
this article that

00:20:42.850 --> 00:20:44.420
they're telling me about.

00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:48.340
When they click through, they
will actually see my name up

00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:50.980
at the top of the page saying
this is the person who shared

00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:51.520
it with you.

00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:54.010
So what we're doing here is
we're taking that share, that

00:20:54.010 --> 00:20:56.640
curator, so to speak, and
weaving them right into the

00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:58.480
narrative of the story and
making them almost as

00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:00.270
important as the person
who wrote that story.

00:21:00.270 --> 00:21:01.050
DANIEL SIEBERG: They're
really participating

00:21:01.050 --> 00:21:01.470
in the whole process.

00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:02.110
ROBYN PETERSON: They
really are.

00:21:02.110 --> 00:21:02.370
They really are.

00:21:02.370 --> 00:21:03.030
DANIEL SIEBERG: That's
fantastic.

00:21:03.030 --> 00:21:05.120
All right, now let's move
on and talk about Glass.

00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:05.510
ROBYN PETERSON: Sure.

00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:07.360
DANIEL SIEBERG: And
how Mashable is

00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:09.440
tying in with that.

00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:10.540
It's hard to do a
demo right now.

00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:13.080
But you can maybe walk me
through what that experience

00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:16.400
is like when a story starts to
go viral, how somebody wearing

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:20.780
Glass, who's got the Mashable
Glassware, can experience that

00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:22.000
fact that the story
is going viral.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:22.390
ROBYN PETERSON: Sure.

00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:25.790
So thinking back to this summer,
we actually released

00:21:25.790 --> 00:21:27.450
something called Mashable
Velocity.

00:21:27.450 --> 00:21:29.740
And what that is is a viral
detection engine.

00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:32.090
So we have crawlers that go out,
look at all the activity

00:21:32.090 --> 00:21:35.450
on social web, bring all that
data back, dump it into a

00:21:35.450 --> 00:21:37.880
predictive engine, and basically
tell us what's going

00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:39.105
viral on the web.

00:21:39.105 --> 00:21:42.560
When we reduce that down to
Mashable stories, now we have

00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:45.340
a pretty interesting kind of
prospect for Glassware.

00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:48.150
So all of the users who are
now wearing Glass, if they

00:21:48.150 --> 00:21:51.540
authenticate with the Mashable
Glassware, will receive alerts

00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:55.000
of Mashable stories about four
hours before they go viral.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:56.095
So they'll be ahead
of the game.

00:21:56.095 --> 00:21:57.350
DANIEL SIEBERG: They're
really in the know.

00:21:57.350 --> 00:21:58.170
ROBYN PETERSON: They
really are.

00:21:58.170 --> 00:21:58.380
They really are.

00:21:58.380 --> 00:22:00.790
They'll know exactly what
everyone's going to talk about

00:22:00.790 --> 00:22:01.890
before they're talking
about it.

00:22:01.890 --> 00:22:03.970
DANIEL SIEBERG: And Mashable's
been such a great partner with

00:22:03.970 --> 00:22:05.310
Google+ really from
the beginning.

00:22:05.310 --> 00:22:07.185
What has that experience been
like, if you can sort of talk

00:22:07.185 --> 00:22:07.825
me through it.

00:22:07.825 --> 00:22:08.970
ROBYN PETERSON: It's been
fantastic for us.

00:22:08.970 --> 00:22:10.370
We have a lot of followers
on Google+.

00:22:10.370 --> 00:22:13.110
I think we have over 2 million
people that have +1'd us and

00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:14.590
really follow our page.

00:22:14.590 --> 00:22:17.520
We have a very vibrant community
that's on Google+.

00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:20.470
So we love doing things like
this where we can better

00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:22.700
engage that community and
actually have a little bit of

00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:23.990
fun on the engineering
side as well.

00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:24.150
DANIEL SIEBERG: Cool.

00:22:24.150 --> 00:22:25.640
Robyn, thank you so much for
"hanging out", if you will.

00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:26.690
ROBYN PETERSON: Of course.

00:22:26.690 --> 00:22:27.570
DANIEL SIEBERG: Appreciate it.

00:22:27.570 --> 00:22:28.820
ROBYN PETERSON: Thanks,
Daniel.

00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:37.010
DANIEL SIEBERG: Moving on to
Voxie now, and I'm joined by

00:22:37.010 --> 00:22:38.380
Sam from Voxie.

00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:40.630
And maybe the best way to
describe Voxie, as far as I

00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:43.610
understand it, is it's a way for
people to learn a language

00:22:43.610 --> 00:22:46.380
but through their
own interests.

00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:49.640
It pushes them in a way that
is familiar to them.

00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:51.770
So help me understand what
Voxie's about, first of all.

00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:52.700
SAMUEL DOZOR: That's right.

00:22:52.700 --> 00:22:55.010
So Voxie was founded off the
concept that language learning

00:22:55.010 --> 00:22:57.350
should be contextual.

00:22:57.350 --> 00:22:59.450
Everybody knows how they learned
a language in high

00:22:59.450 --> 00:23:02.400
school from a boring textbook
not geared towards their

00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:03.850
specific interests.

00:23:03.850 --> 00:23:06.230
Voxie wants to teach you a
language based on what you're

00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:09.490
interested in and exactly what
your language needs are.

00:23:09.490 --> 00:23:09.661
DANIEL SIEBERG: Cool.

00:23:09.661 --> 00:23:11.620
So here we are on
the Voxie site.

00:23:11.620 --> 00:23:14.110
And how does this tie in to
Google+ from a Sign In

00:23:14.110 --> 00:23:15.030
standpoint?

00:23:15.030 --> 00:23:15.580
SAMUEL DOZOR: Sure.

00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:19.710
So we have an Android app, an
iOS app, and a web app.

00:23:19.710 --> 00:23:23.990
And we want to make sure that
login and registration is as

00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:25.282
seamless as possible.

00:23:25.282 --> 00:23:29.890
If you have an Android phone
and you have a computer at

00:23:29.890 --> 00:23:31.940
home, we want you to be able
to login wherever you are

00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:35.140
without having to remember all
these different passwords.

00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:37.320
So Google+ helped us do that.

00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:40.380
You can go right here
and go to our login.

00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:43.280
And along with our other login
options, we have a prominent

00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:50.580
Google+ login, which when
clicked on asks you, OK, would

00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:53.160
you like Voxie to
access Google?

00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:59.490
So by doing that and hitting
Accept, we start

00:23:59.490 --> 00:24:00.100
along the flow here.

00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:02.930
And here's actually a great
feature of Google+ allowing us

00:24:02.930 --> 00:24:04.880
to do over-the-air installs.

00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:08.240
So a learner can say, hey, oh,
this is available on my

00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:09.520
Android device.

00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:11.655
And with the new single sign-on
feature that Google

00:24:11.655 --> 00:24:14.610
introduced today, actually,
they'll be able to open up

00:24:14.610 --> 00:24:16.890
Voxie on their Android device
and be logged right in

00:24:16.890 --> 00:24:17.550
immediately.

00:24:17.550 --> 00:24:18.020
DANIEL SIEBERG: That's great.

00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:18.500
That's great.

00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:21.590
So, of course, one of the big
features within Google+ is the

00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:22.580
ability to do Hangouts.

00:24:22.580 --> 00:24:23.130
SAMUEL DOZOR: Yes.

00:24:23.130 --> 00:24:25.530
DANIEL SIEBERG: And certainly
learning a language is made

00:24:25.530 --> 00:24:27.920
easier when you can be
conversational about it with

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:30.085
somebody who also knows
it really well.

00:24:30.085 --> 00:24:32.670
So tell me how you're tying in
Hangouts with this experience.

00:24:32.670 --> 00:24:33.300
SAMUEL DOZOR: Absolutely, yes.

00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:37.882
So one of our first interests
in Google+ came from our

00:24:37.882 --> 00:24:39.090
leverage of Hangouts.

00:24:39.090 --> 00:24:41.290
So as you said, it's important
to have one on

00:24:41.290 --> 00:24:43.300
one time with a teacher.

00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:48.356
And Voxie enables learners to
have these one-on-one lessons

00:24:48.356 --> 00:24:49.070
with the teachers.

00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:51.340
But in order to do that, we
needed a great platform to

00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:54.050
leverage so that you can have
that video conference.

00:24:54.050 --> 00:24:55.300
So we chose Google Hangouts.

00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:59.280
In order to do that, our users
need to have Google accounts.

00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:01.860
So all of our learners today,
for the millions of Voxie

00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:04.740
users, can connect their account
to Google+, such that

00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:08.780
they can schedule, search for
a tutor, schedule a session,

00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:10.965
and begin learning one
on one with a tutor.

00:25:10.965 --> 00:25:11.560
DANIEL SIEBERG: That's great.

00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:13.620
And tell me about the experience
of working with the

00:25:13.620 --> 00:25:16.030
Google+ development community.

00:25:16.030 --> 00:25:17.985
How has that been so far?

00:25:17.985 --> 00:25:20.160
SAMUEL DOZOR: It's been
a lot of fun.

00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:23.830
I was lucky enough to
attend a boot camp.

00:25:23.830 --> 00:25:27.200
Google was nice enough to invite
Voxie on site such that

00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:30.950
I could work one on one
with their developers.

00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:33.420
And it really made the
experience much more seamless

00:25:33.420 --> 00:25:35.095
to have that one-on-one
action.

00:25:35.095 --> 00:25:37.640
But to be honest, the
documentation worked out

00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:38.980
pretty well for us.

00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:42.660
We were able to implement this
with only a few weeks time.

00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:45.930
So given we're a start-up
company and we like to move

00:25:45.930 --> 00:25:48.876
fast, so we needed to do this
quickly, and Google definitely

00:25:48.876 --> 00:25:49.770
worked it out for us.

00:25:49.770 --> 00:25:50.330
DANIEL SIEBERG: Very cool.

00:25:50.330 --> 00:25:52.370
I can barely speak English
proficiently, so I feel like I

00:25:52.370 --> 00:25:53.480
need something like this.

00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:54.350
SAMUEL DOZOR: Oh, absolutely.

00:25:54.350 --> 00:25:55.460
DANIEL SIEBERG: Thank
you so much, Sam.

00:25:55.460 --> 00:25:55.910
SAMUEL DOZOR: No problem.

00:25:55.910 --> 00:25:57.160
Thank you.

00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:03.670
DANIEL SIEBERG: All right.

00:26:03.670 --> 00:26:06.110
We finish up here with Jolicloud
, and I'm joined

00:26:06.110 --> 00:26:09.790
right now by Tariq from
Jolicloud, founder and CEO, as

00:26:09.790 --> 00:26:10.630
I understand it.

00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:11.070
TARIQ KRIM: Absolutely.

00:26:11.070 --> 00:26:12.830
DANIEL SIEBERG: So talk to me
a little bit about what

00:26:12.830 --> 00:26:14.300
Jolicloud is first of all.

00:26:14.300 --> 00:26:16.260
And then we can get into how
it ties into Google+.

00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:16.870
TARIQ KRIM: Sure.

00:26:16.870 --> 00:26:20.420
So Jolicloud is a company we
started four years ago with a

00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:21.000
simple idea.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:23.970
We felt like our lives were
moving from the computer to

00:26:23.970 --> 00:26:25.990
the cloud, and it was
spread across so

00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:28.880
many different places.

00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:32.010
Now YouTube is the place where
I go and watch my videos.

00:26:32.010 --> 00:26:33.600
I have my content on Drive.

00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:36.650
I have photos in Picasa and
Instagram, on all these

00:26:36.650 --> 00:26:37.650
different services.

00:26:37.650 --> 00:26:40.670
And we felt there was no
singular interface to access

00:26:40.670 --> 00:26:41.740
everything at once.

00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:42.980
So we built it.

00:26:42.980 --> 00:26:43.330
DANIEL SIEBERG: OK.

00:26:43.330 --> 00:26:45.100
So talk me through here.

00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:46.180
You can sign in with Google+.

00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:47.210
TARIQ KRIM: Absolutely.

00:26:47.210 --> 00:26:49.690
So here we'll just sign in.

00:26:49.690 --> 00:26:51.840
And as you see, we'll
automatically see that I've

00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:54.560
already granted all these
different services.

00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:58.580
And I we'll be able to go and
pretty much you remember when

00:26:58.580 --> 00:27:01.610
we use these computers, the
finder, the availabilities,

00:27:01.610 --> 00:27:04.750
all the services I have
here that I sign on.

00:27:04.750 --> 00:27:06.536
Let me go to Google Drive.

00:27:06.536 --> 00:27:10.490
As you can see, I can browse
through my content.

00:27:10.490 --> 00:27:14.400
I can also access all my content
in a very simple way.

00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:18.250
And if I need to access specific
content, I will just

00:27:18.250 --> 00:27:21.175
go and press and be able
to access the content.

00:27:21.175 --> 00:27:22.680
DANIEL SIEBERG: And just to be
clear, you're not storing any

00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:23.270
of this content.

00:27:23.270 --> 00:27:24.060
TARIQ KRIM: We don't
store anything.

00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:24.970
DANIEL SIEBERG: It's just
an interface to

00:27:24.970 --> 00:27:25.740
access all of these.

00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:25.960
TARIQ KRIM: Absolutely.

00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:28.160
We take all the APIs from all
the different services, and we

00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:30.240
try to make them consistent
and beautiful.

00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:31.970
DANIEL SIEBERG: Using HTML5?

00:27:31.970 --> 00:27:32.640
TARIQ KRIM: It's all HTML5.

00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:32.900
Absolutely.

00:27:32.900 --> 00:27:33.250
DANIEL SIEBERG: OK.

00:27:33.250 --> 00:27:33.600
OK.

00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:36.470
TARIQ KRIM: So one of my
favorite services is actually

00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:39.750
the integration of YouTube,
because I can not only have

00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:42.900
access to all my previous lists
of content for the new

00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:45.490
Daft Punk video, of course.

00:27:45.490 --> 00:27:49.130
But if I want to share content,
I can actually share

00:27:49.130 --> 00:27:52.380
it on my favorite site,
but also be able to

00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:53.440
favor it right away.

00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:57.680
And now, later tonight when I
want to go and check what I

00:27:57.680 --> 00:28:00.705
should look at, I can go to the
Watch Later section, or

00:28:00.705 --> 00:28:02.050
probably here--

00:28:02.050 --> 00:28:02.540
I don't have here--

00:28:02.540 --> 00:28:05.570
to My Favorites section
and access to mine.

00:28:05.570 --> 00:28:10.180
So we basically give you
access to your music.

00:28:10.180 --> 00:28:11.490
We have XFM, SoundCloud.

00:28:11.490 --> 00:28:13.930
More services are coming
soon to all your

00:28:13.930 --> 00:28:15.140
different file systems.

00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:17.290
I can actually go on different
services like

00:28:17.290 --> 00:28:19.300
Box, Dropbox, or drive.

00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:22.770
And as you can see, the user
interface is consistent.

00:28:22.770 --> 00:28:25.120
Think about how we used to
be on our computers.

00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:26.750
We have our own file system.

00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:29.640
Now we've actually translated
that into the cloud in a very

00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:31.210
simple and seamless way.

00:28:31.210 --> 00:28:31.640
DANIEL SIEBERG: Great.

00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:32.600
Well, Tariq, thank
you so much--

00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:33.550
TARIQ KRIM: Thank you so
much for having us.

00:28:33.550 --> 00:28:33.975
DANIEL SIEBERG: --for walking
us through this explanation.

00:28:33.975 --> 00:28:35.490
I really appreciate it.

00:28:35.490 --> 00:28:35.660
All right.

00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:38.310
That's going to do it from here
at the Google+ sandbox.

00:28:38.310 --> 00:28:40.220
I'm Daniel Sieberg with Google
Developers Live.
