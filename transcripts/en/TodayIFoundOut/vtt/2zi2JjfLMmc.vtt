00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:14.080
Martha was a 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:15.190
very lonely bird.

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:19.490
She had once been part of a pair, with her
male counterpart George, but he had died several

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:20.490
years before.

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.600
So, for the final years of her life, Martha
sat in her one-bird cage alone.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:30.810
The Cincinnati Zoo offered a thousand dollar
reward (about $23,000 today) to anyone who

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.330
could track down a mate for Martha.

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:35.860
Unfortunately, there were no mates left for
her.

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:42.200
On September 1, 1914, Martha, the last known
passenger pigeon, died at the Cincinnati Zoo.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.410
Just like that, a bird that numbered in the
billions about a half century before, was

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.910
gone.

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.510
The passenger pigeon once dominated the North
American skies.

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.180
It has been estimated that when Europeans
first arrived to this continent late in the

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:00.190
15th century, there were three to five billion
passenger pigeons already here.

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:05.050
To put that in perspective, its distant cousin,
the rock pigeon – the birds you see hanging

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:09.670
out in courtyards eating bread crumbs – number
about 260 million worldwide.

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:14.250
That said, it has been argued that passenger
pigeon population numbers may have been much

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:21.010
less in North America, but after a huge percentage
of the Native American population died off

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:26.500
from diseases introduced by the Europeans,
it may have caused a passenger pigeon population

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.500
explosion, similar to what happened with the
American Bison during this time.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:36.290
But either way, not long after Europeans arrived,
this pigeon population numbered in the billions.

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.590
Passenger_pigeonsLegends abound about how
these birds used to black out the sky when

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:41.780
they moved en masse.

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.750
John James Audubon, the famed naturalist and
ornithologist, once said he saw a flock create

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.210
a full “solar eclipse” for three days
as it passed.

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.610
While this is *probably* a bit of an exaggeration,
accounts from towns across North America,

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:00.780
like Columbus, Ohio and Fort Mississauga,
Ontario, made it seem like a mass of passing

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.620
passenger pigeons was something out of the
Bible, even apocalyptic in nature.

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:08.119
In fact, it’s estimated that the largest
flocks of passenger pigeons were second only

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.310
to the Rocky Mountain locusts in group size.

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.490
For reference, the Rocky Mountain locusts
could potentially swarm an area the size of

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:21.890
California, with an estimated 12.5 trillion
locusts in the largest such swarm ever recorded.

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.819
As for the passenger pigeon, when the birds
nested, they formed colonies that were extraordinary

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:27.819
in size.

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:34.500
In 1871, a colony in central Wisconsin was
recorded to have occupied 850 square miles,

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.440
a little larger in size than the entire country
of Georgia.

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:44.599
In 1866, a passing flock of passenger pigeons
was estimated to contain 3.5 billion of the

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:51.540
birds, with the width of the flock about 1.5
miles and the length about 300 miles.

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.830
Needless to say, if you were traveling under
the flying column, an umbrella of some sort

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.920
probably would have been a good idea.

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.130
So, what happened to these birds?

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:06.430
How, in such a short time, could the passenger
pigeon go from being more numerous than all

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.270
other North American birds combined to extinct?

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:13.450
If you guessed “humans,” you’re correct.

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.700
According to a hunting journal in 1913, the
passenger pigeons were known to be “the

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.610
gypsies of the birdom.”

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.660
They traveled en masse to wherever they could
find food and nesting habitats.

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.790
They were known to travel up to eighty miles
daily from their roost in search of food.

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.761
And they ate… a lot.

00:03:30.761 --> 00:03:34.209
They had fondness for soft fruits like blueberries,
strawberries, and figs.

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:36.490
They also ate acorns and chestnuts.

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:41.440
Henry David Thoreau once wrote, “It is a
wonder how pigeons can swallow acorns whole,

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:42.879
but they do.”

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:47.319
The plentiful chestnut, maple, oak, and pine
forests of North America not only provided

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:51.300
food to the passenger pigeon, but a home and
a place to nest (or roost).

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:54.890
Those trees also provided ample firewood to
humans.

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:59.210
By the 18th and 19th centuries, the human
population on the continent was exploding

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:04.620
— from under four million in 1790 to seventy-six
million by 1900.

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.720
As human numbers grew, land was needed to
accommodate.

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.630
Unfortunately, this was the same land the
passenger pigeons occupied.

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:16.340
As much as human settlement deforested the
country, the pigeons did a pretty good job

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:19.499
themselves in wreaking havoc in an ecosystem.

00:04:19.499 --> 00:04:24.820
An entire flock would pick an area to nest
and occupy that location like an army, often

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:28.580
weighing down tree limbs so much that they
would snap right off.

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:33.800
Further, the combined droppings of the mass
of birds ended up being toxic to certain trees

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.589
and could kill them.

00:04:35.589 --> 00:04:40.849
In the definitive book about passenger pigeons,
“A Feathered River Across the Sky: The Passenger

00:04:40.849 --> 00:04:45.159
Pigeon’s Flight to Extinction” by Joel
Greenberg, he writes that if a “tornado

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:50.479
had visited the forest before the occupation
of birds, the damage might have been less…”

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:55.589
But deforestation was only a contributing
factor in the extinction of the passenger

00:04:55.589 --> 00:04:56.589
pigeon.

00:04:56.589 --> 00:05:00.139
The main reason they went from billions to
zero in about a half century was because they

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:05.300
were just so darn tasty, or at the very least,
abundant and easy to kill.

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:08.139
When the first humans started showing up fifteen
thousand years ago in the northern hemisphere,

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:12.220
they immediately began including passenger
pigeons in their diet.

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:16.219
When Europeans began settling, they quickly
figured out that passenger pigeons were a

00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:17.619
cheap source of food.

00:05:17.619 --> 00:05:21.319
The meat became quite popular with the poor,
simply because anyone could at least make

00:05:21.319 --> 00:05:24.490
a few kills among the heavily populated nests.

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:28.280
Even children could knock out a few pigeons
and start clubbing away.

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:33.110
Squabs- pigeon chicks- would get so chubby
on “pigeon’s milk,” a liquid high in

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:34.110
protein and nutrients that was regurgitated
by both parents, that they would move very

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:35.139
slowly, making them easy prey.

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:39.460
By the mid 19th century, professional pigeon
trapping was a major industry.

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:42.000
Trappers were making money hand over fist.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.160
By 1855, the number of passenger pigeons were
noticeably declining, though the flocks were

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:52.039
still massive as noted above, so very little
was done about it.

00:05:52.039 --> 00:05:57.749
In 1857, a bill was presented to the Ohio
State legislature, but was quickly dismissed.

00:05:57.749 --> 00:05:59.839
A report was filed that read,

00:05:59.839 --> 00:06:02.139
The passenger pigeon needs no protection.

00:06:02.139 --> 00:06:06.499
Wonderfully prolific, having the vast forests
of the North as its breeding grounds, traveling

00:06:06.499 --> 00:06:11.690
hundreds of miles in search of food, it is
here today and elsewhere tomorrow.

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:15.710
A huge nesting area was found in Petoskey,
Michigan in 1878.

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:22.270
Trappers flocked there and, according to the
Smithsonian, over a five month period 50,000

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:24.289
birds per day were killed.

00:06:24.289 --> 00:06:28.550
This turned out to be one of the last large
nesting areas in North America.

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:33.819
As this fact became apparent, a bill was finally
passed making it illegal to trap pigeons within

00:06:33.819 --> 00:06:36.229
two miles of their nesting area.

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:41.080
By 1890, the wild passenger pigeon was nearly
completely eradicated.

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:46.330
In 1897, the Michigan state legislature passed
a bill putting a ten year ban on the killing

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:47.830
of passenger pigeons.

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:50.490
But it was too late.

00:06:50.490 --> 00:07:15.719
Seventeen years later, the last known living
passenger pigeon would die alone 

00:07:15.719 --> 00:07:23.739
in her cage.
