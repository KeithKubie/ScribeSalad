00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.612
We're asked to graph y
is equal to 2.5 times x.

00:00:04.612 --> 00:00:06.820
So we really just have to
think about two points that

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:09.100
satisfy this equation here,
and the most obvious one

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:10.580
is what happens when x equals 0.

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:13.990
When x equals 0, 2.5
times 0 is going to be 0.

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:18.416
So when x is 0, y is
going to be equal to 0.

00:00:18.416 --> 00:00:20.040
And then let's just
pick another x that

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.640
will give us a y that
is a whole number.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.874
So if x increases by 1, y
is going to increase by 2.5.

00:00:27.874 --> 00:00:29.290
It's going to go
right over there,

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:31.110
and I could graph
it just like that.

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:33.320
And we see just by
what I just said

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.990
that the unit rate of change
of y with respect to x is 2.5.

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:42.820
A unit increase in x, an
increase of 1 and x, results

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.750
in a 2.5 increase in y.

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.540
You see that right over
here. x goes from 0 to 1,

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.710
and y goes from 0 to 2.5.

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.930
But let's increase
x by another 1,

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.840
and then y is going to increase
by 2.5 again to get to 5.

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.150
Or you could say, hey, look,
if x is equal to 2, 2.5 times

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:01.390
2 is equal to 5.

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.080
So this is a legitimate
graph for this equation,

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.970
but then they also
tell us to select

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.620
the statements that are true.

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.960
So the first one is
the equation does not

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.050
represent a proportional
relationship.

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:15.800
Well, this is a
proportional relationship.

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.629
A proportional
relationship is one

00:01:17.629 --> 00:01:19.670
where, first of all, if
you have zero x's, you're

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.690
going to have zero y's, where y
is equal to some constant times

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:24.190
x.

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:26.890
And here, y is equal
to 2.5 times x.

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.200
So this is definitely a
proportional relationship,

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.870
so I'm not going to check that.

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:33.834
The unit rate of the
relationship is 2/5.

00:01:33.834 --> 00:01:35.250
So I'm assuming--
this is a little

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.920
ambiguous the way
they stated it.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.760
I'm assuming they're saying
the unit rate of change of y

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.950
with respect to x.

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.640
And the unit rate of change
of y with respect to x

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.260
is, when x increases
1, y changed 2.5.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.900
So here they're saying when x
changes by 1, y changes by 0.4,

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.680
2/5 is the same thing as 0.4.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.010
This should be 5/2.

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:58.620
5/2 would be 2.4.

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.440
So this isn't right as well.

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.462
The slope of the line is 2.5.

00:02:02.462 --> 00:02:03.420
Well, this looks right.

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.230
Slope is change in
y over change in x.

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:09.830
When x changes 1, y changes 2.5.

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.710
So change in y, 2.5,
over change in x, 1.

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.986
2.5 over 1 is 2.5.

00:02:15.986 --> 00:02:17.360
And you could also
see it looking

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.930
at the form of
this equation. y is

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.370
equal to-- this is
the slope times x.

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.070
So that's right.

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:28.760
A change of 5 units in x results
in a change of 2 units in y.

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.670
Well, let's test that idea.

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.770
We know when x is 0, y is 0.

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:37.750
So if x goes from 0 to 5,
what's going to happen to y?

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.080
Well, y is going
to be 2.5 times 5.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.640
2.5 times 5 is 12.5.

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.870
So y would not just change 2.

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.520
It actually would change 12.5.

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.030
So this isn't right.

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.170
A change of 2 units in x results
in a change of 5 units in y.

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:57.270
Well, we see that.

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.992
A change in 2 units of x results
in a change of 5 units in y.

00:03:00.992 --> 00:03:02.950
That's exactly what we
graphed right over here.

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.690
These two points show that.

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.430
So this is definitely true.
