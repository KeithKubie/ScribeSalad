are rampant and in schools it's very
 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.580
are rampant and in schools it's very
clear I mean the the statistics show

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590

that bullying is a major major problem
 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.929
that bullying is a major major problem
in most American schools and what they

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939
in most American schools and what they
 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.940
in most American schools and what they
find is that in school schools have a

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950
find is that in school schools have a
 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.280
find is that in school schools have a
number of different qualities and one of

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290
number of different qualities and one of
 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.840
number of different qualities and one of
them is the anti-democratic governing

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850
them is the anti-democratic governing
 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.030
them is the anti-democratic governing
structure if you look at most American

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040
structure if you look at most American
 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.050
structure if you look at most American
high schools for example they are

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060
high schools for example they are
 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.410
high schools for example they are
gargantuan mammoth institutions they

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420
gargantuan mammoth institutions they
 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.980
gargantuan mammoth institutions they
have thousands upon thousands of kids

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990
have thousands upon thousands of kids
 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.690
have thousands upon thousands of kids
walking through the hallways every day

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700
walking through the hallways every day
 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.510
walking through the hallways every day
and what what happens as a result of

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520
and what what happens as a result of
 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:39.590
and what what happens as a result of
this and this is not necessarily the

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600
this and this is not necessarily the
 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.600
this and this is not necessarily the
fault of teachers or even just the

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610
fault of teachers or even just the
 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.460
fault of teachers or even just the
people in that school building when you

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470
people in that school building when you
 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.460
people in that school building when you
have such a large student body and you

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470
have such a large student body and you
 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.469
have such a large student body and you
don't have you have large class sizes

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479
don't have you have large class sizes
 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.359
don't have you have large class sizes
there's not enough time for students and

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369
there's not enough time for students and
 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.609
there's not enough time for students and
teachers to have really strong authentic

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619
teachers to have really strong authentic
 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.740
teachers to have really strong authentic
and genuine relationships and students

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750
and genuine relationships and students
 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.959
and genuine relationships and students
basically what happens is they get kind

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969
basically what happens is they get kind
 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:00.830
basically what happens is they get kind
of thrown into this the see of being

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840
of thrown into this the see of being
 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.179
of thrown into this the see of being
anonymous they don't they don't have any

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189
anonymous they don't they don't have any
 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.999
anonymous they don't they don't have any
relationships with their their students

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009
relationships with their their students
 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.399
relationships with their their students
with their fellow peers and and students

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409
with their fellow peers and and students
 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:08.990
with their fellow peers and and students
that are really rich an authentic level

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000
that are really rich an authentic level
 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.510
that are really rich an authentic level
and so when students feel that they have

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520
and so when students feel that they have
 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.550
and so when students feel that they have
no power or no agency

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560
no power or no agency
 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.930
no power or no agency
their school experiences what often

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940
their school experiences what often
 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.550
their school experiences what often
happens is something called cliques

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560
happens is something called cliques
 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.290
happens is something called cliques
arise if students feel that they have

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300
arise if students feel that they have
 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.229
arise if students feel that they have
two real power and get control within

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239
two real power and get control within
 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.420
two real power and get control within
themselves and within their ranks and so

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430
themselves and within their ranks and so
 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.670
themselves and within their ranks and so
cliques are one of the major phenomenons

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680
cliques are one of the major phenomenons
 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.470
cliques are one of the major phenomenons
in American schools where they create

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480
in American schools where they create
 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.390
in American schools where they create
basically power structures within the

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400
basically power structures within the
 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.550
basically power structures within the
student body themselves and so you have

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560
student body themselves and so you have
 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.350
student body themselves and so you have
people at the top of the system who are

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360
people at the top of the system who are
 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.020
people at the top of the system who are
essentially the most popular kids they

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030
essentially the most popular kids they
 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.550
essentially the most popular kids they
and then you have the kids at the bottom

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560
and then you have the kids at the bottom
 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.979
and then you have the kids at the bottom
or oftentimes the the Nerds and the

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989
or oftentimes the the Nerds and the
 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:41.960
or oftentimes the the Nerds and the
people who are not so that's a popular

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970
people who are not so that's a popular
 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.150
people who are not so that's a popular
to have the best looks and so you have

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160
to have the best looks and so you have
 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.979
to have the best looks and so you have
this very destructive system that comes

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989
this very destructive system that comes
 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:47.960
this very destructive system that comes
about and bullying is one of the side

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970
about and bullying is one of the side
 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.759
about and bullying is one of the side
effects and symptoms that come out of

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769
effects and symptoms that come out of
 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:51.770
effects and symptoms that come out of
that and so what I would argue is that

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780
that and so what I would argue is that
 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.900
that and so what I would argue is that
when you have institutions that where

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910
when you have institutions that where
 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.490
when you have institutions that where
students and teachers have strong

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500
students and teachers have strong
 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.259
students and teachers have strong
relationships with one another where

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269
relationships with one another where
 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:58.880
relationships with one another where
students feel that they are known by the

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890
students feel that they are known by the
 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.009
students feel that they are known by the
adult in that community where they have

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019
adult in that community where they have
 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:02.780
adult in that community where they have
agency and voice over the learning

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790
agency and voice over the learning
 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.820
agency and voice over the learning
experiences bullying incidents are very

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830
experiences bullying incidents are very
 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.550
experiences bullying incidents are very
rare and in my book I talk about

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560
rare and in my book I talk about
 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.360
rare and in my book I talk about
institutions and three schools and

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370
institutions and three schools and
 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.070
institutions and three schools and
democratic schools where bullying is

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080
democratic schools where bullying is
 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.410
democratic schools where bullying is
almost non-existent and this is a large

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420
almost non-existent and this is a large
 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.630
almost non-existent and this is a large
part due to the fact that students feel

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640
part due to the fact that students feel
 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.569
part due to the fact that students feel
that they have a voice and role in their

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:17.579
that they have a voice and role in their
 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:19.940
that they have a voice and role in their
school decision-making process and they

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950
school decision-making process and they
 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.759
school decision-making process and they
have the structures in place to fix and

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769
have the structures in place to fix and
 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:25.069
have the structures in place to fix and
alleviate incidents of bullying so if

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079
alleviate incidents of bullying so if
 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:26.750
alleviate incidents of bullying so if
everything is transparent where they can

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760
everything is transparent where they can
 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.610
everything is transparent where they can
