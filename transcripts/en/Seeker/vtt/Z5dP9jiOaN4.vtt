00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:03.879
More than 50,000 Americans are currently on
the waitlist for a new kidney.

00:00:03.879 --> 00:00:12.910
And a new procedure means that they could
receive a kidney from any donor in the world.

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:13.980
Hello everyone!

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.150
Amy digging into some neat body stuff with
you on DNews today.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:18.150
Specifically, kidneys.

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.789
Kidneys are great.

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:23.599
They clean our blood and make hormones that
keep our bones strong and our blood healthy.

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:24.599
But they can fail.

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:28.400
While we can live with one kidney, we can't
live with none, so in cases of double kidney

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.090
failure a transplant is really the best option.

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:34.920
A kidney transplant, like any organ transplant,
works best if there’s a match between the

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.420
donor and the recipient.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.559
That's because our bodies are pretty good
at rejecting foreign objects.

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:43.520
The cells that make up any organ have antigens,
and if the organ’s antigens are different

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.421
from the host’s body, it triggers an immune
response and the body will attack the new

00:00:47.421 --> 00:00:48.421
organ.

00:00:48.421 --> 00:00:52.180
So transplants demand that doctors “type”
both the donor and recipient to establish

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:53.879
whether the pair are a match.

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.910
A perfect match means both people have the
same blood type and compatibility between

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:00.350
six Human Leukocyte Antigens.

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.410
No two people are exactly the same, but the
more similar two people’s antigens are the

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:08.360
more likely the transplant will be a success,
although finding a good match can be incredibly

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:09.360
difficult.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.800
So doctors will use drugs to suppress the
recipient’s immune system to lower the chances

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.100
of the body attacking the transplanted kidney.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.250
But a new process called desensitization detailed
in The New England Journal of Medicine offers

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.920
a new solution: altering a recipient’s immune
system without drugs to allow him or her to

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.450
accept a kidney from an incompatible donor.

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.040
The process involves filtering the antibodies
out of a recipient's blood and replacing them

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.920
with antibodies that match the donor, making
the two people more compatible.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.210
Now, this won’t change the recipient’s
blood forever; eventually their immune system

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.470
will replenish itself with its own antibodies.

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:44.100
But here's the super cool but super weird
bit: experts don't totally know why, but those

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.590
regenerated antibodies are less likely to
attack the newly transplanted organ!

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:54.250
The promising results come from a 22-center
study looking at 1,025 kidney transplant recipients.

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.140
Those who went through the desensitization
process had a significantly higher survival

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.690
rate: 76.5 percent of them were still alive
eight years after the transplant.

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.580
Compare that to recipients who stayed on the
waitlist to eventually get a compatible kidney.

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.619
This group had a survival rate of 62.9 percent.

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:12.239
So it’s a relatively small sample size,
but it's promising.

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:14.470
And it could change so many lives.

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.030
Currently, patients unable to find compatible
donors have no other option but dialysis,

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.329
a regular procedure that filters your blood
to get rid of waste, extra salt, and water.

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:26.750
It's doing a kidney’s job without having
a working kidney but it’s far from ideal

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.390
and can be detrimental to a patient's health,
long-term.

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.360
Desensitization could mean thousands of people
would be spared a life of these constant treatments.

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.840
The human body is fascinating, and sometimes,
we don’t have enough time to talk about

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:38.840

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:56.950
