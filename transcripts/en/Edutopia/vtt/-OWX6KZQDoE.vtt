&gt;&gt;Steven: I was a bad student.

00:00:19.356 --> 00:00:25.846
Skipped school quite a bit, and I
really didn't find education exciting

00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:29.776
until I got to college,
because then I got

00:00:29.826 --> 00:00:33.116
to control how I was going to learn.

00:00:35.016 --> 00:00:36.546
My name is Stephen Zipkes,

00:00:36.896 --> 00:00:40.196
I'm the founding principal Manor
New Technology High School,

00:00:40.576 --> 00:00:43.806
in Manor Independent School
District, Manor, Texas.

00:00:50.186 --> 00:00:54.016
Manor New Tech is a 100 percent
project based instruction school.

00:00:54.296 --> 00:00:56.916
Students at this school
not only get the knowledge,

00:00:57.356 --> 00:01:01.026
but they learn the application, so
the knowledge than becomes relevant

00:01:01.256 --> 00:01:03.976
when they have to apply it
to a real world situation.

00:01:21.316 --> 00:01:23.916
&gt;&gt;Mary: I'm super excited about
this project about the Hunger Games.

00:01:24.576 --> 00:01:27.586
My co-teacher, Michael Chambers,
he is the expert in history.

00:01:27.796 --> 00:01:31.076
I sat down with Michael
and said, you know what,

00:01:31.076 --> 00:01:34.416
I think this is how we can fit it in,
let's look at your state standards

00:01:34.756 --> 00:01:38.916
and let's look at my standards
and see what is coming up next.

00:01:52.616 --> 00:01:54.886
&gt;&gt;Michael: So what's your standards
you're going to be covering in this?

00:01:55.346 --> 00:01:59.856
&gt;&gt;Mary: We're going to do 5A,
which is analyzing scenes, 5B,

00:01:59.856 --> 00:02:03.336
analyzing different characters'
moral dilemmas, and this is huge.

00:02:03.606 --> 00:02:06.346
&gt;&gt;Steven: We have no choice
on what we teach, really.

00:02:06.566 --> 00:02:08.506
The state tells us
what we have to teach.

00:02:08.626 --> 00:02:10.456
&gt;&gt;Mary: What are yours
again, that we're hitting,

00:02:10.456 --> 00:02:12.206
so I can go ahead and write this out?

00:02:12.206 --> 00:02:14.976
&gt;&gt;Michael: WH 12, history of the
student to understand the cause

00:02:14.976 --> 00:02:17.586
and impact of World War
II, describe the emergence

00:02:17.586 --> 00:02:19.786
and characteristics
of totalitarianism.

00:02:21.006 --> 00:02:24.646
&gt;&gt;Mary: We hooked the kids into
the project with the entry event.

00:02:24.646 --> 00:02:27.816
And then we do what's called
the knows and the need to knows,

00:02:27.816 --> 00:02:31.616
and that's where the student
will give us a list of things,

00:02:31.616 --> 00:02:33.686
what do you know about this content,

00:02:33.766 --> 00:02:37.056
so they go through their prior
knowledge and then they talk

00:02:37.056 --> 00:02:39.986
about what do they need
to know, so we're talking

00:02:39.986 --> 00:02:44.096
about leaving the students
breadcrumbs in these entry events,

00:02:44.096 --> 00:02:46.096
and those breadcrumbs
would be like clues.

00:02:46.236 --> 00:02:50.096
This idea of wait a minute, I kind
of-- I've heard this word before,

00:02:50.096 --> 00:02:53.026
I don't know exactly what that
means, so that's a need to know

00:02:53.026 --> 00:02:55.126
and I'll ask that at another time.

00:02:55.736 --> 00:02:58.356
&gt;&gt;Student: You probably need to
include that picture that I had

00:02:58.356 --> 00:03:02.636
on the research, because we used
that in the question for Columbia.

00:03:02.636 --> 00:03:03.946
&gt;&gt;Student: Okay, we done here?

00:03:04.646 --> 00:03:07.776
&gt;&gt;Mary: The process of a
project is constantly changing.

00:03:07.996 --> 00:03:11.636
We have to look at what the students
are doing, how they're learning,

00:03:11.716 --> 00:03:14.076
do we need to go back and
do some more scaffolding?

00:03:14.526 --> 00:03:17.806
Really, if I have a student who
is three quarters of the way,

00:03:17.806 --> 00:03:19.486
or almost done with
an entire project,

00:03:19.486 --> 00:03:23.206
and has not been doing very well,
I really step back and wonder,

00:03:23.466 --> 00:03:25.376
where was I this whole time?

00:03:25.376 --> 00:03:30.126
Why wasn't I paying more attention
to where the student's progress was?

00:03:30.126 --> 00:03:35.646
&gt;&gt;Steven: Our students are
averaging 60 projects a year.

00:03:36.216 --> 00:03:40.466
So they're averaging 60 to
65 public speeches a year.

00:03:40.996 --> 00:03:44.206
By the time they graduate,
over 200 public speeches.

00:03:45.106 --> 00:03:46.036
They know how to talk.

00:03:46.386 --> 00:03:48.186
&gt;&gt;Student: Right now, my
favorite project is called,

00:03:48.186 --> 00:03:49.276
Create your own Project.

00:03:49.276 --> 00:03:51.386
&gt;&gt;Student: My favorite project
this year was in chemistry,

00:03:51.386 --> 00:03:54.106
and what it was about,
we were using chemistry

00:03:54.106 --> 00:03:55.996
and reactions to create a soda.

00:03:55.996 --> 00:03:59.606
&gt;&gt;Student: It's a video production
class, and we're making a kids' show.

00:03:59.606 --> 00:04:00.896
We're calling it the Dojo Show.

00:04:01.056 --> 00:04:03.036
&gt;&gt;Student: We're learning
about spatial diffusion,

00:04:03.036 --> 00:04:04.766
black death, the Columbian Exchange.

00:04:04.876 --> 00:04:06.506
&gt;&gt;Student: Reactions
like double replacement,

00:04:06.506 --> 00:04:07.866
combustion, things like that.

00:04:07.896 --> 00:04:10.336
&gt;&gt;Student: I like it because
it gives me a whole lot

00:04:10.336 --> 00:04:11.336
of room to be creative.

00:04:24.716 --> 00:04:28.396
&gt;&gt;Mary: You'll notice that we're
covering a lot of the state standards

00:04:28.396 --> 00:04:33.876
that deal with working in groups
and how you are giving feedback

00:04:33.876 --> 00:04:36.116
to each other on content.

00:04:36.116 --> 00:04:38.056
At the end of the class period,
you need to have a complete

00:04:38.056 --> 00:04:39.906
and finalized presentation.

00:04:39.906 --> 00:04:44.546
So critical friends will be over
on that side, everyone else,

00:04:44.546 --> 00:04:47.666
continue working on your
presentations, and we'll get started.

00:04:49.836 --> 00:04:53.286
&gt;&gt;So this half of the class
has been working on a protocol

00:04:53.286 --> 00:04:54.656
that is called critical friends,

00:04:54.796 --> 00:04:58.216
where they're getting feedback
on their presentations.

00:04:58.576 --> 00:05:02.466
&gt;&gt;Student: We're going to do
a skit on our moral dilemma.

00:05:02.656 --> 00:05:03.936
&gt;&gt;Student: Here's our choices.

00:05:03.976 --> 00:05:07.046
Do we take him back to the
Germans so they can kill him,

00:05:07.046 --> 00:05:08.676
do we attempt to take
them to a medical center,

00:05:08.676 --> 00:05:10.356
so they can heal him
and save his life?

00:05:10.816 --> 00:05:11.316
&gt;&gt;Student: Hmm.

00:05:11.636 --> 00:05:12.426
What should I do?

00:05:12.936 --> 00:05:15.816
Should I let my country suffer
from the lack of resources?

00:05:16.076 --> 00:05:17.946
&gt;&gt;Student: I like the fact that
they're doing a skit instead

00:05:17.946 --> 00:05:20.926
of a PowerPoint or something, because
they actually make it interesting

00:05:20.926 --> 00:05:23.016
and they, like, interact with
the audience and everything.

00:05:23.226 --> 00:05:24.776
&gt;&gt;Mary: The, I likes,
are just obvious,

00:05:24.846 --> 00:05:27.186
what do they like about
those presentations.

00:05:27.526 --> 00:05:30.056
The, I wonders, are maybe
some clarifying questions

00:05:30.056 --> 00:05:32.536
that they might have
about those presentations.

00:05:32.996 --> 00:05:35.486
&gt;&gt;Student: I wonder why he,
like, chose the specific music

00:05:35.486 --> 00:05:37.056
to go with the presentation?

00:05:37.056 --> 00:05:38.266
That's what I wonder.

00:05:38.266 --> 00:05:40.706
&gt;&gt;Mary: And the next steps are some--

00:05:41.066 --> 00:05:44.146
that's where the critique
comes in, some feedback.

00:05:44.146 --> 00:05:45.736
&gt;&gt;Student: Put some more
emotion into your speaking,

00:05:45.736 --> 00:05:47.876
like really sell why you
would choose a reason.

00:05:48.246 --> 00:05:50.966
&gt;&gt;Mary: They're going to present
their papers, but how they present,

00:05:51.546 --> 00:05:54.776
it always-- how they
present is their choice,

00:05:54.776 --> 00:05:56.696
but they always do
something multimedia.

00:06:04.536 --> 00:06:07.696
&gt;&gt;Of course, we're having
presentations this morning.

00:06:07.696 --> 00:06:11.786
What you should have, each
group should have one slip--

00:06:11.786 --> 00:06:14.776
&gt;&gt;Student: As everybody knows, we
read the book, "The Hunger Games".

00:06:15.466 --> 00:06:16.736
&gt;&gt;Student: So what
is a moral dilemma?

00:06:17.306 --> 00:06:20.066
It's a situation where all your
choices are morally challenging.

00:06:20.146 --> 00:06:25.076
&gt;&gt;Student: Ours was to risk
your life to save another.

00:06:25.496 --> 00:06:27.476
&gt;&gt;Student: There's three Jewish
prisoners and they escaped

00:06:27.476 --> 00:06:29.526
from a German concentration camp.

00:06:29.526 --> 00:06:34.516
Me and Jorge, Abe, and Jeremiah,
escaped fine, but our friend,

00:06:34.516 --> 00:06:37.966
Philiam, is wounded and he will
die if he doesn't get help.

00:06:38.606 --> 00:06:41.996
I can't choose my own selfish
desires to keep a friend,

00:06:41.996 --> 00:06:45.456
then doing what is right and just and
letting him go through all that pain.

00:06:45.456 --> 00:06:49.946
Thank you.

00:06:49.946 --> 00:06:53.896
&gt;&gt;Mary: I'm assessing them on various
pieces of the oral communication,

00:06:54.336 --> 00:06:59.206
like how they organized their ideas,
and how they delivered those ideas,

00:06:59.206 --> 00:07:01.486
what kind of tone they used
during the presentation,

00:07:01.486 --> 00:07:04.306
and any kind of rhetorical
strategies they--

00:07:04.306 --> 00:07:05.756
&gt;&gt;Student: I'm more of
an independent student,

00:07:05.756 --> 00:07:08.516
of me grabbing knowledge
than someone telling me.

00:07:08.806 --> 00:07:11.746
I believe it has prepared
me to take the state test,

00:07:11.746 --> 00:07:15.196
because it's a new way of
learning and it sticks to you

00:07:15.196 --> 00:07:18.996
in a way that's different
from an oral teaching class.

00:07:18.996 --> 00:07:21.946
&gt;&gt;Mary: When you put them in
this setting, then suddenly,

00:07:23.176 --> 00:07:26.076
it just makes sense to them.

00:07:26.076 --> 00:07:30.236
They see the potential that
they never saw in themselves,

00:07:30.766 --> 00:07:37.376
and I get excited about my content
again, because it challenges me,

00:07:37.696 --> 00:07:40.776
and when I get excited about
my content, they get excited,

00:07:41.166 --> 00:07:44.246
and when they get excited, it
just feeds me more, and it just--

00:07:44.246 --> 00:07:46.306
to me, it makes it all worthwhile.
