so absolutely nails the the various
 

00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:27.280
so absolutely nails the the various
things that we said so we're going to

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:27.290
things that we said so we're going to
 

00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:29.050
things that we said so we're going to
quickly put up the the prescriptions

00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:29.060
quickly put up the the prescriptions
 

00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:31.900
quickly put up the the prescriptions
that we had go through that first so

00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:31.910
that we had go through that first so
 

00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:34.329
that we had go through that first so
yeah design guidelines we gave a tick

00:12:34.329 --> 00:12:34.339
yeah design guidelines we gave a tick
 

00:12:34.339 --> 00:12:36.730
yeah design guidelines we gave a tick
timer stopwatch so I think the concerns

00:12:36.730 --> 00:12:36.740
timer stopwatch so I think the concerns
 

00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:38.079
timer stopwatch so I think the concerns
here we had around the rich

00:12:38.079 --> 00:12:38.089
here we had around the rich
 

00:12:38.089 --> 00:12:40.150
here we had around the rich
notifications which weren't as rich as

00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:40.160
notifications which weren't as rich as
 

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:43.090
notifications which weren't as rich as
as some of the other apps and I think we

00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:43.100
as some of the other apps and I think we
 

00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:44.920
as some of the other apps and I think we
were not entirely convinced that it was

00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:44.930
were not entirely convinced that it was
 

00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:46.360
were not entirely convinced that it was
using a service in the right way I think

00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:46.370
using a service in the right way I think
 

00:12:46.370 --> 00:12:47.710
using a service in the right way I think
for the stopwatch there was no

00:12:47.710 --> 00:12:47.720
for the stopwatch there was no
 

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:49.269
for the stopwatch there was no
notification for stop watch which

00:12:49.269 --> 00:12:49.279
notification for stop watch which
 

00:12:49.279 --> 00:12:52.990
notification for stop watch which
implied no ongoing notification so you

00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:53.000
implied no ongoing notification so you
 

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.130
implied no ongoing notification so you
want to tell us a little bit about the

00:12:54.130 --> 00:12:54.140
want to tell us a little bit about the
 

00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:56.740
want to tell us a little bit about the
app before we get too stuck into the

00:12:56.740 --> 00:12:56.750
app before we get too stuck into the
 

00:12:56.750 --> 00:13:02.470
app before we get too stuck into the

a lot of timers for this sort of
 

00:21:09.790 --> 00:21:12.720
a lot of timers for this sort of
specialized but they didn't have all the

00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:12.730
specialized but they didn't have all the
 

00:21:12.730 --> 00:21:15.810
specialized but they didn't have all the
stuff i need it so they didn't work

00:21:15.810 --> 00:21:15.820
stuff i need it so they didn't work
 

00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:20.160

00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:29.890
i wanted to have because i wanted to do
 

00:21:29.890 --> 00:21:33.060
i wanted to have because i wanted to do
sort of more complex workouts but they

00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:33.070
sort of more complex workouts but they
 

00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:36.900
sort of more complex workouts but they
need that they could do so this is sort

00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:36.910
need that they could do so this is sort
 

00:21:36.910 --> 00:21:38.970
need that they could do so this is sort
of from my own own need and then I just

00:21:38.970 --> 00:21:38.980
of from my own own need and then I just
 

00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:41.250
of from my own own need and then I just
wanted to publish it and see if somebody

00:21:41.250 --> 00:21:41.260
wanted to publish it and see if somebody

else wants to have it so uh what I aim
 

00:21:44.230 --> 00:21:47.070
else wants to have it so uh what I aim
for was earth you have to have a really

00:21:47.070 --> 00:21:47.080
for was earth you have to have a really
 

00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:50.280
for was earth you have to have a really
clear display because when doing

00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:50.290
clear display because when doing
 

00:21:50.290 --> 00:21:51.600
clear display because when doing
interval training you're going to be

00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:51.610
interval training you're going to be
 

00:21:51.610 --> 00:21:53.580
interval training you're going to be
sort of exhausted and you can't see sort

00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:53.590
sort of exhausted and you can't see sort
 

00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:56.520
sort of exhausted and you can't see sort
of five meters ahead of you so yeah so

00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:56.530
of five meters ahead of you so yeah so
 

00:21:56.530 --> 00:21:58.050
of five meters ahead of you so yeah so
you have to have big numbers and stuff

00:21:58.050 --> 00:21:58.060
you have to have big numbers and stuff
 

00:21:58.060 --> 00:21:59.700
you have to have big numbers and stuff
like that yeah we can say that on the

00:21:59.700 --> 00:21:59.710
like that yeah we can say that on the
 

00:21:59.710 --> 00:22:02.130
like that yeah we can say that on the
screen you got the big bowls you know

00:22:02.130 --> 00:22:02.140
screen you got the big bowls you know
 

00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:04.080
screen you got the big bowls you know
bright white numbers switched a cup you

00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:04.090
bright white numbers switched a cup you
 

00:22:04.090 --> 00:22:06.330
bright white numbers switched a cup you
know a big part of the screen so that's

00:22:06.330 --> 00:22:06.340
know a big part of the screen so that's
 

00:22:06.340 --> 00:22:08.880
know a big part of the screen so that's
yeah it's interesting and then I wanted

00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:08.890
yeah it's interesting and then I wanted
 

00:22:08.890 --> 00:22:11.430
yeah it's interesting and then I wanted
to have a landscape mode because most

00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:11.440
to have a landscape mode because most
 

00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:13.020
to have a landscape mode because most
didn't have it so I

00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:13.030
didn't have it so I
 

00:22:13.030 --> 00:22:15.750
didn't have it so I
dedicated view for that so it sort of

00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:15.760
dedicated view for that so it sort of
 

00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:19.170
dedicated view for that so it sort of
changes two different buttons and

00:22:19.170 --> 00:22:19.180
changes two different buttons and
 

00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:24.330
changes two different buttons and
whatever whatever and and then they we

00:22:24.330 --> 00:22:24.340
whatever whatever and and then they we
 

00:22:24.340 --> 00:22:26.070
whatever whatever and and then they we
address your up the landscape mode when

00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:26.080
address your up the landscape mode when
 

00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:27.330
address your up the landscape mode when
we look at it during the show that's

00:22:27.330 --> 00:22:27.340
we look at it during the show that's
 

00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:31.320
we look at it during the show that's
it's definitely idea yeah then the

00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:31.330
it's definitely idea yeah then the
 

00:22:31.330 --> 00:22:33.390
it's definitely idea yeah then the
timing mechanics I wanted to have a

00:22:33.390 --> 00:22:33.400
timing mechanics I wanted to have a
 

00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:35.910
timing mechanics I wanted to have a
timer that you can use if you just want

00:22:35.910 --> 00:22:35.920
timer that you can use if you just want
 

00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:38.250
timer that you can use if you just want
to have a really simple workout or if

00:22:38.250 --> 00:22:38.260
to have a really simple workout or if
 

00:22:38.260 --> 00:22:40.020
to have a really simple workout or if
you really want to go wild with

00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:40.030
you really want to go wild with
 

00:22:40.030 --> 00:22:44.220
you really want to go wild with
something really weird so there's an to

00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:44.230
something really weird so there's an to
 

00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:47.550
something really weird so there's an to
edit mode so you can have a basic that

00:22:47.550 --> 00:22:47.560
edit mode so you can have a basic that
 

00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:50.580
edit mode so you can have a basic that
you looked at so there's a sort of a

00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:50.590
you looked at so there's a sort of a
 

00:22:50.590 --> 00:22:53.070
you looked at so there's a sort of a
really normal work and rest and whatever

00:22:53.070 --> 00:22:53.080
really normal work and rest and whatever
 

00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:55.110
really normal work and rest and whatever
and rounds and then you have another

00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:55.120
and rounds and then you have another
 

00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:59.520
and rounds and then you have another
server mr. Hyde you just met the doctor

00:22:59.520 --> 00:22:59.530
server mr. Hyde you just met the doctor
 

00:22:59.530 --> 00:23:02.490
server mr. Hyde you just met the doctor
Jekyll there's a sort of mr. Hyde there

00:23:02.490 --> 00:23:02.500
Jekyll there's a sort of mr. Hyde there
 

00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:04.500
Jekyll there's a sort of mr. Hyde there
so there's the advanced mode where you

00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:04.510
so there's the advanced mode where you
 

00:23:04.510 --> 00:23:06.330
so there's the advanced mode where you
can surf there's a drag-and-drop

00:23:06.330 --> 00:23:06.340
can surf there's a drag-and-drop
 

00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:08.910
can surf there's a drag-and-drop
interface and whatever it's a surfer

00:23:08.910 --> 00:23:08.920
interface and whatever it's a surfer
 

00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:12.150
interface and whatever it's a surfer
tree structure and with loops and stuff

00:23:12.150 --> 00:23:12.160
tree structure and with loops and stuff
 

00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:16.230
tree structure and with loops and stuff
like that it's pretty far out there so I

00:23:16.230 --> 00:23:16.240
like that it's pretty far out there so I
 

00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:19.140
like that it's pretty far out there so I
sort of wanted to push the limit of what

00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:19.150
sort of wanted to push the limit of what
 

00:23:19.150 --> 00:23:22.290
sort of wanted to push the limit of what
the interval timer can do so you can

00:23:22.290 --> 00:23:22.300
the interval timer can do so you can
 

00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:24.900
the interval timer can do so you can
have a really many sets there you can

00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:24.910
have a really many sets there you can
 

00:23:24.910 --> 00:23:28.860
have a really many sets there you can
have like you said in the app clinic

00:23:28.860 --> 00:23:28.870
have like you said in the app clinic
 

00:23:28.870 --> 00:23:30.660
have like you said in the app clinic
that you can have have pyramids where

00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:30.670
that you can have have pyramids where
 

00:23:30.670 --> 00:23:34.320
that you can have have pyramids where
the time mr. of alternating and stuff

00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:34.330
the time mr. of alternating and stuff
 

00:23:34.330 --> 00:23:36.480
the time mr. of alternating and stuff
like that so it's pretty advanced

00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:36.490
like that so it's pretty advanced
 

00:23:36.490 --> 00:23:39.180
like that so it's pretty advanced
interesting so i think it's interesting

00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:39.190
interesting so i think it's interesting
 

00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:40.590
interesting so i think it's interesting
i think one of the challenges for the

00:23:40.590 --> 00:23:40.600
i think one of the challenges for the
 

00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:42.420
i think one of the challenges for the
Advanced Mode we're sort of playing with

00:23:42.420 --> 00:23:42.430
Advanced Mode we're sort of playing with
 

00:23:42.430 --> 00:23:46.140
Advanced Mode we're sort of playing with
it on a screen that you can't see just

00:23:46.140 --> 00:23:46.150
it on a screen that you can't see just
 

00:23:46.150 --> 00:23:47.430
it on a screen that you can't see just
to see sort of what you're talking about

00:23:47.430 --> 00:23:47.440
to see sort of what you're talking about
 

00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:49.290
to see sort of what you're talking about
any writer it looks like there's there's

00:23:49.290 --> 00:23:49.300
any writer it looks like there's there's
 

00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:51.150
any writer it looks like there's there's
quite an advanced set of things that you

00:23:51.150 --> 00:23:51.160
quite an advanced set of things that you
 

00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:53.400
quite an advanced set of things that you
can do it i think and maybe this is

00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:53.410
can do it i think and maybe this is
 

00:23:53.410 --> 00:23:56.940
can do it i think and maybe this is
because neither in nor i do this kind of

00:23:56.940 --> 00:23:56.950
because neither in nor i do this kind of
 

00:23:56.950 --> 00:23:59.220
because neither in nor i do this kind of
interval training I don't want to speak

00:23:59.220 --> 00:23:59.230
interval training I don't want to speak
 

00:23:59.230 --> 00:24:00.840
interval training I don't want to speak
for you in is this what you were just a

00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:00.850
for you in is this what you were just a
 

00:24:00.850 --> 00:24:03.600
for you in is this what you were just a
zero off to do everything not in this

00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:03.610
zero off to do everything not in this
 

00:24:03.610 --> 00:24:06.030
zero off to do everything not in this
manner now not on this matter so I think

00:24:06.030 --> 00:24:06.040
manner now not on this matter so I think
 

00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:07.440
manner now not on this matter so I think
the fact that neither is particularly

00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:07.450
the fact that neither is particularly
 

00:24:07.450 --> 00:24:08.730
the fact that neither is particularly
experienced with this makes it a little

00:24:08.730 --> 00:24:08.740
experienced with this makes it a little
 

00:24:08.740 --> 00:24:12.030
experienced with this makes it a little
bit harder to to understand but I think

00:24:12.030 --> 00:24:12.040
bit harder to to understand but I think
 

00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:14.580
bit harder to to understand but I think
the work flow around the advanced sort

00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:14.590
the work flow around the advanced sort
 

00:24:14.590 --> 00:24:17.280
the work flow around the advanced sort
of view could be a little bit more

00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:17.290
of view could be a little bit more
 

00:24:17.290 --> 00:24:18.470
of view could be a little bit more
intuitive it

00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:18.480
intuitive it
 

00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:20.690
intuitive it
so it doesn't give me a lot of help if I

00:24:20.690 --> 00:24:20.700
so it doesn't give me a lot of help if I
 

00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:22.130
so it doesn't give me a lot of help if I
don't already know what I'm trying to do

00:24:22.130 --> 00:24:22.140
don't already know what I'm trying to do
 

00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:23.600
don't already know what I'm trying to do
and if this is a nephew designed for

00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:23.610
and if this is a nephew designed for
 

00:24:23.610 --> 00:24:25.460
and if this is a nephew designed for
yourself that makes perfect sense right

00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:25.470
yourself that makes perfect sense right
 

00:24:25.470 --> 00:24:27.230
yourself that makes perfect sense right
because you just build the workflow that

00:24:27.230 --> 00:24:27.240
because you just build the workflow that
 

00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:31.460
because you just build the workflow that
makes sense to you yeah or if it depends

00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:31.470
makes sense to you yeah or if it depends
 

00:24:31.470 --> 00:24:33.110
makes sense to you yeah or if it depends
on the person some some people who have

00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:33.120
on the person some some people who have
 

00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:34.850
on the person some some people who have
said that they don't really understand

00:24:34.850 --> 00:24:34.860
said that they don't really understand
 

00:24:34.860 --> 00:24:36.890
said that they don't really understand
anything so that's true but many people

00:24:36.890 --> 00:24:36.900
anything so that's true but many people
 

00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:39.169
anything so that's true but many people
have said that yeah this is this really

00:24:39.169 --> 00:24:39.179
have said that yeah this is this really
 

00:24:39.179 --> 00:24:41.990
have said that yeah this is this really
the way to do it that they can sir yeah

00:24:41.990 --> 00:24:42.000
the way to do it that they can sir yeah
 

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.120
the way to do it that they can sir yeah
make their way around it I think I'm

00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:44.130
make their way around it I think I'm
 

00:24:44.130 --> 00:24:45.950
make their way around it I think I'm
getting a hang of this yeah I don't

00:24:45.950 --> 00:24:45.960
getting a hang of this yeah I don't
 

00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:48.350
getting a hang of this yeah I don't
think this is a bad interface at all you

00:24:48.350 --> 00:24:48.360
think this is a bad interface at all you
 

00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:51.440
think this is a bad interface at all you
know actually what it reminds me a lot

00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:51.450
know actually what it reminds me a lot
 

00:24:51.450 --> 00:24:53.539
know actually what it reminds me a lot
of maybe because I've been doing so much

00:24:53.539 --> 00:24:53.549
of maybe because I've been doing so much
 

00:24:53.549 --> 00:24:55.520
of maybe because I've been doing so much
in as the adobe tools you know where you

00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:55.530
in as the adobe tools you know where you
 

00:24:55.530 --> 00:24:58.490
in as the adobe tools you know where you
move things into layers and such so yeah

00:24:58.490 --> 00:24:58.500
move things into layers and such so yeah
 

00:24:58.500 --> 00:25:02.390
move things into layers and such so yeah
I think there's some see it does that

00:25:02.390 --> 00:25:02.400
I think there's some see it does that
 

00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:03.860
I think there's some see it does that
make sense yeah well we're playing with

00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:03.870
make sense yeah well we're playing with
 

00:25:03.870 --> 00:25:06.289
make sense yeah well we're playing with
it just just off your camera I think the

00:25:06.289 --> 00:25:06.299
it just just off your camera I think the
 

00:25:06.299 --> 00:25:08.090
it just just off your camera I think the
people watching on YouTube broadcast can

00:25:08.090 --> 00:25:08.100
people watching on YouTube broadcast can
 

00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:09.650
people watching on YouTube broadcast can
see but yeah it's sort of once you've

00:25:09.650 --> 00:25:09.660
see but yeah it's sort of once you've
 

00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:11.000
see but yeah it's sort of once you've
added a few things it starts to make a

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:11.010
added a few things it starts to make a
 

00:25:11.010 --> 00:25:14.330
added a few things it starts to make a
lot of sense yeah I think for for

00:25:14.330 --> 00:25:14.340
lot of sense yeah I think for for
 

00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:16.460
lot of sense yeah I think for for
something that says complex is this it's

00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:16.470
something that says complex is this it's
 

00:25:16.470 --> 00:25:18.830
something that says complex is this it's
hard to see how it could get one better

00:25:18.830 --> 00:25:18.840
hard to see how it could get one better
 

00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:24.620
hard to see how it could get one better
I think maybe you know an easier way to

00:25:24.620 --> 00:25:24.630
I think maybe you know an easier way to
 

00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:27.620
I think maybe you know an easier way to
add rounds for instance you know one

00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:27.630
add rounds for instance you know one
 

00:25:27.630 --> 00:25:29.890
add rounds for instance you know one
thing that I've appreciated about some

00:25:29.890 --> 00:25:29.900
thing that I've appreciated about some
 

00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:32.930
thing that I've appreciated about some
programs like this is that if you just

00:25:32.930 --> 00:25:32.940
programs like this is that if you just
 

00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:34.669
programs like this is that if you just
drag things to the left or to the right

00:25:34.669 --> 00:25:34.679
drag things to the left or to the right
 

00:25:34.679 --> 00:25:36.860
drag things to the left or to the right
it will sort of infer you know okay

00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:36.870
it will sort of infer you know okay
 

00:25:36.870 --> 00:25:38.030
it will sort of infer you know okay
you're dragging it to the right that

00:25:38.030 --> 00:25:38.040
you're dragging it to the right that
 

00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:40.430
you're dragging it to the right that
means you want it to be part of a set or

00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:40.440
means you want it to be part of a set or
 

00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:42.409
means you want it to be part of a set or
around her like that yeah yeah okay

00:25:42.409 --> 00:25:42.419
around her like that yeah yeah okay
 

00:25:42.419 --> 00:25:44.419
around her like that yeah yeah okay
that's cool that's interesting I'm just

00:25:44.419 --> 00:25:44.429
that's cool that's interesting I'm just
 

00:25:44.429 --> 00:25:46.280
that's cool that's interesting I'm just
going to bring up real quick the the

00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:46.290
going to bring up real quick the the
 

00:25:46.290 --> 00:25:47.750
going to bring up real quick the the
tips that we had so I think one of the

00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:47.760
tips that we had so I think one of the
 

00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:49.520
tips that we had so I think one of the
things here was we commented that it

00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:49.530
things here was we commented that it
 

00:25:49.530 --> 00:25:50.870
things here was we commented that it
didn't have the really rich

00:25:50.870 --> 00:25:50.880
didn't have the really rich
 

00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:52.970
didn't have the really rich
notifications that some of the design

00:25:52.970 --> 00:25:52.980
notifications that some of the design
 

00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:54.799
notifications that some of the design
elements were a little bit off from what

00:25:54.799 --> 00:25:54.809
elements were a little bit off from what
 

00:25:54.809 --> 00:25:58.039
elements were a little bit off from what
the design guide says yeah and the fact

00:25:58.039 --> 00:25:58.049
the design guide says yeah and the fact
 

00:25:58.049 --> 00:25:59.810
the design guide says yeah and the fact
that it lacked the stopwatch functions

00:25:59.810 --> 00:25:59.820
that it lacked the stopwatch functions
 

00:25:59.820 --> 00:26:03.440
that it lacked the stopwatch functions
as well frankly I think you know given

00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:03.450
as well frankly I think you know given
 

00:26:03.450 --> 00:26:05.659
as well frankly I think you know given
what you've described as the purpose for

00:26:05.659 --> 00:26:05.669
what you've described as the purpose for
 

00:26:05.669 --> 00:26:07.280
what you've described as the purpose for
the app I think it kind of makes sense

00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:07.290
the app I think it kind of makes sense
 

00:26:07.290 --> 00:26:09.440
the app I think it kind of makes sense
why there isn't a stopwatch there to

00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:09.450
why there isn't a stopwatch there to
 

00:26:09.450 --> 00:26:10.970
why there isn't a stopwatch there to
begin with but I think again based on

00:26:10.970 --> 00:26:10.980
begin with but I think again based on
 

00:26:10.980 --> 00:26:13.370
begin with but I think again based on
money and was saying earlier it's it's

00:26:13.370 --> 00:26:13.380
money and was saying earlier it's it's
 

00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:15.260
money and was saying earlier it's it's
kind of a piece of functionality you may

00:26:15.260 --> 00:26:15.270
kind of a piece of functionality you may
 

00:26:15.270 --> 00:26:16.520
kind of a piece of functionality you may
want to have while you're doing this

00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:16.530
want to have while you're doing this
 

00:26:16.530 --> 00:26:18.740
want to have while you're doing this
sort of exercise as well so let me let

00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:18.750
sort of exercise as well so let me let
 

00:26:18.750 --> 00:26:20.960
sort of exercise as well so let me let
me give you an example and this may be

00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:20.970
me give you an example and this may be
 

00:26:20.970 --> 00:26:23.140
me give you an example and this may be
unique to the way that I work out but

00:26:23.140 --> 00:26:23.150
unique to the way that I work out but
 

00:26:23.150 --> 00:26:26.450
unique to the way that I work out but
sometimes I'll be working out you know

00:26:26.450 --> 00:26:26.460
sometimes I'll be working out you know
 

00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:28.110
sometimes I'll be working out you know
in some sort of timed manner

00:26:28.110 --> 00:26:28.120
in some sort of timed manner
 

00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:29.490
in some sort of timed manner
and then I'm just you know I'm feeling

00:26:29.490 --> 00:26:29.500
and then I'm just you know I'm feeling
 

00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:31.050
and then I'm just you know I'm feeling
really good i want to just keep going

00:26:31.050 --> 00:26:31.060
really good i want to just keep going
 

00:26:31.060 --> 00:26:32.940
really good i want to just keep going
and so what i want is at the very least

00:26:32.940 --> 00:26:32.950
and so what i want is at the very least
 

00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:35.340
and so what i want is at the very least
I want the timer to count down past zero

00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:35.350
I want the timer to count down past zero
 

00:26:35.350 --> 00:26:37.710
I want the timer to count down past zero
so I going yeah that makes sense that

00:26:37.710 --> 00:26:37.720
so I going yeah that makes sense that
 

00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:38.760
so I going yeah that makes sense that
makes sense it means that something that

00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:38.770
makes sense it means that something that
 

00:26:38.770 --> 00:26:40.380
makes sense it means that something that
you know you're interested in doing do

00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:40.390
you know you're interested in doing do
 

00:26:40.390 --> 00:26:42.060
you know you're interested in doing do
you want do you know are you dead pretty

00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:42.070
you want do you know are you dead pretty
 

00:26:42.070 --> 00:26:43.620
you want do you know are you dead pretty
clear is it just that I'm not nearly as

00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:43.630
clear is it just that I'm not nearly as
 

00:26:43.630 --> 00:26:45.780
clear is it just that I'm not nearly as
disciplined maybe that's what you need

00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:45.790
disciplined maybe that's what you need
 

00:26:45.790 --> 00:26:47.430
disciplined maybe that's what you need
less stuff watches and more discipline

00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:47.440
less stuff watches and more discipline
 

00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:49.740
less stuff watches and more discipline
there you go well what are your thoughts

00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:49.750
there you go well what are your thoughts
 

00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:51.270
there you go well what are your thoughts
you know is it a piece of functionality

00:26:51.270 --> 00:26:51.280
you know is it a piece of functionality
 

00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:52.980
you know is it a piece of functionality
you'd consider putting in or is that

00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:52.990
you'd consider putting in or is that
 

00:26:52.990 --> 00:26:55.320

not not as a sort of dedicated feature
because yeah it's out of the scope but

00:27:02.010 --> 00:27:02.020
because yeah it's out of the scope but
 

00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:04.980
because yeah it's out of the scope but
they're sort of East a stopwatch there

00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:04.990
they're sort of East a stopwatch there
 

00:27:04.990 --> 00:27:09.060
they're sort of East a stopwatch there
you just have to have to know it because

00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:09.070
you just have to have to know it because
 

00:27:09.070 --> 00:27:12.720
you just have to have to know it because
in the indie if you're using there's a

00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:12.730
in the indie if you're using there's a
 

00:27:12.730 --> 00:27:16.200
in the indie if you're using there's a
sort of a log it there that you you can

00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:16.210
sort of a log it there that you you can
 

00:27:16.210 --> 00:27:18.450
sort of a log it there that you you can
add there you can go to the preferences

00:27:18.450 --> 00:27:18.460
add there you can go to the preferences
 

00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:20.250
add there you can go to the preferences
and you can add a third button there

00:27:20.250 --> 00:27:20.260
and you can add a third button there
 

00:27:20.260 --> 00:27:22.710
and you can add a third button there
actually which is this orifice keep

00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:22.720
actually which is this orifice keep
 

00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:25.230
actually which is this orifice keep
button and you can use a log that when

00:27:25.230 --> 00:27:25.240
button and you can use a log that when
 

00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:27.540
button and you can use a log that when
you when you punch the skip button it's

00:27:27.540 --> 00:27:27.550
you when you punch the skip button it's
 

00:27:27.550 --> 00:27:29.970
you when you punch the skip button it's
going to record the time that was

00:27:29.970 --> 00:27:29.980
going to record the time that was
 

00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:34.920
going to record the time that was
elapsed is that point good and then you

00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:34.930
elapsed is that point good and then you
 

00:27:34.930 --> 00:27:37.140
elapsed is that point good and then you
in the end you can have a sort of run

00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:37.150
in the end you can have a sort of run
 

00:27:37.150 --> 00:27:39.390
in the end you can have a sort of run
down that you took 15 seconds on the

00:27:39.390 --> 00:27:39.400
down that you took 15 seconds on the
 

00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:42.960
down that you took 15 seconds on the
first interval then you took 25 and so

00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:42.970
first interval then you took 25 and so
 

00:27:42.970 --> 00:27:45.840
first interval then you took 25 and so
on so it is there but it's sure it's not

00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:45.850
on so it is there but it's sure it's not
 

00:27:45.850 --> 00:27:48.060
on so it is there but it's sure it's not
obvious it's a little bit yeah well see

00:27:48.060 --> 00:27:48.070
obvious it's a little bit yeah well see
 

00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:50.430
obvious it's a little bit yeah well see
you also have I shake to skip and shake

00:27:50.430 --> 00:27:50.440
you also have I shake to skip and shake
 

00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:52.470

think of this but one alternative might
 

00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:48.020
think of this but one alternative might
be to enable something like shake skip

00:28:48.020 --> 00:28:48.030
be to enable something like shake skip

at the my sort of basic version i would
 

00:29:46.110 --> 00:29:47.900
at the my sort of basic version i would
say that you're looking at the Jekyll

00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:47.910
say that you're looking at the Jekyll
 

00:29:47.910 --> 00:29:51.350
say that you're looking at the Jekyll
version for sure mmhmm yeah so sort of a

00:29:51.350 --> 00:29:51.360
version for sure mmhmm yeah so sort of a
 

00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:53.930
version for sure mmhmm yeah so sort of a
sort of putting it into my appt sort of

00:29:53.930 --> 00:29:53.940
sort of putting it into my appt sort of
 

00:29:53.940 --> 00:29:57.680
sort of putting it into my appt sort of
takes maybe a bit more work because you

00:29:57.680 --> 00:29:57.690
takes maybe a bit more work because you
 

00:29:57.690 --> 00:29:59.810
takes maybe a bit more work because you
have to think about what it does to the

00:29:59.810 --> 00:29:59.820
have to think about what it does to the
 

00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:03.110
have to think about what it does to the
advanced site absolutely under I think

00:30:03.110 --> 00:30:03.120
advanced site absolutely under I think
 

00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:04.490
advanced site absolutely under I think
it would be relatively straightforward

00:30:04.490 --> 00:30:04.500
it would be relatively straightforward
 

00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:06.950
it would be relatively straightforward
to put the the simple case in but you're

00:30:06.950 --> 00:30:06.960
to put the the simple case in but you're
 

00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:08.300
to put the the simple case in but you're
right you want to keep that same look

00:30:08.300 --> 00:30:08.310
right you want to keep that same look
 

00:30:08.310 --> 00:30:10.220
right you want to keep that same look
and feel and functionality across the

00:30:10.220 --> 00:30:10.230
and feel and functionality across the
 

00:30:10.230 --> 00:30:12.050
and feel and functionality across the
entire suite and I think there's really

00:30:12.050 --> 00:30:12.060
entire suite and I think there's really
 

00:30:12.060 --> 00:30:14.600
entire suite and I think there's really
a lot more to it than that so yeah is do

00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:14.610
a lot more to it than that so yeah is do
 

00:30:14.610 --> 00:30:15.710
a lot more to it than that so yeah is do
you think it might be a direction that

00:30:15.710 --> 00:30:15.720
you think it might be a direction that
 

00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:19.310
you think it might be a direction that
you'll slowly try and head down yes

00:30:19.310 --> 00:30:19.320
you'll slowly try and head down yes
 

00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:23.180
you'll slowly try and head down yes
probably because cool i really have to

00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:23.190
probably because cool i really have to
 

00:30:23.190 --> 00:30:25.670
probably because cool i really have to
it's true that it it it's it's pretty

00:30:25.670 --> 00:30:25.680
it's true that it it it's it's pretty
 

00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:28.610
it's true that it it it's it's pretty
difficult for somebody to start using

00:30:28.610 --> 00:30:28.620
difficult for somebody to start using
 

00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:31.970
difficult for somebody to start using
this sort of fresh out of when you load

00:30:31.970 --> 00:30:31.980
this sort of fresh out of when you load
 

00:30:31.980 --> 00:30:34.160
this sort of fresh out of when you load
it up it doesn't really say much what

00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:34.170
it up it doesn't really say much what
 

00:30:34.170 --> 00:30:36.140
it up it doesn't really say much what
you have to do is pretty professional

00:30:36.140 --> 00:30:36.150
you have to do is pretty professional
 

00:30:36.150 --> 00:30:39.980

sort of speech so it would certainly

00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:39.990
sort of speech so it would certainly
 

00:30:39.990 --> 00:30:42.080
sort of speech so it would certainly
help yeah i think that's you know the

00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:42.090
help yeah i think that's you know the
 

00:30:42.090 --> 00:30:44.300
help yeah i think that's you know the
big challenge right is that i think most

00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:44.310
big challenge right is that i think most
 

00:30:44.310 --> 00:30:47.060
big challenge right is that i think most

on writing code to solve problems right

00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:49.710
on writing code to solve problems right
 

00:30:49.710 --> 00:30:51.140
on writing code to solve problems right
you have something that you need done so

00:30:51.140 --> 00:30:51.150
you have something that you need done so
 

00:30:51.150 --> 00:30:52.159
you have something that you need done so
you write an app to

00:30:52.159 --> 00:30:52.169
you write an app to
 

00:30:52.169 --> 00:30:53.779
you write an app to
take care of that and then you can could

00:30:53.779 --> 00:30:53.789
take care of that and then you can could
 

00:30:53.789 --> 00:30:55.700
take care of that and then you can could
put it on google play really easy and to

00:30:55.700 --> 00:30:55.710
put it on google play really easy and to
 

00:30:55.710 --> 00:30:56.840

see if there's anyone else who finds it
 

00:30:56.850 --> 00:30:58.759
see if there's anyone else who finds it
useful and it's kind of not until you

00:30:58.759 --> 00:30:58.769
useful and it's kind of not until you
 

00:30:58.769 --> 00:31:00.139
useful and it's kind of not until you
get to that certain level of popularity

00:31:00.139 --> 00:31:00.149
get to that certain level of popularity
 

00:31:00.149 --> 00:31:02.840
get to that certain level of popularity

00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:02.850
that you like actually you know maybe I
 

00:31:02.850 --> 00:31:04.039
that you like actually you know maybe I
should turn this into something that

00:31:04.039 --> 00:31:04.049
should turn this into something that
 

00:31:04.049 --> 00:31:07.099
should turn this into something that
anyone can use and then it can be real

00:31:07.099 --> 00:31:07.109
anyone can use and then it can be real
 

00:31:07.109 --> 00:31:08.840
anyone can use and then it can be real
it can be real challenged takes a lot of

00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:08.850
it can be real challenged takes a lot of
 

00:31:08.850 --> 00:31:10.849
it can be real challenged takes a lot of

especially when you're in a crowded
field like this I you know I know every

00:31:15.649 --> 00:31:15.659
field like this I you know I know every
 

00:31:15.659 --> 00:31:17.539
field like this I you know I know every
time I've gone looking for an app to

00:31:17.539 --> 00:31:17.549
time I've gone looking for an app to
 

00:31:17.549 --> 00:31:19.909
time I've gone looking for an app to
suit a specific purpose and I know I'm

00:31:19.909 --> 00:31:19.919
suit a specific purpose and I know I'm
 

00:31:19.919 --> 00:31:20.899
suit a specific purpose and I know I'm
not the only one that does this I'll

00:31:20.899 --> 00:31:20.909
not the only one that does this I'll
 

00:31:20.909 --> 00:31:23.570
not the only one that does this I'll
download five or ten abs hmm and check

00:31:23.570 --> 00:31:23.580
download five or ten abs hmm and check
 

00:31:23.580 --> 00:31:26.149
download five or ten abs hmm and check
them out really quickly and so there's

00:31:26.149 --> 00:31:26.159
them out really quickly and so there's
 

00:31:26.159 --> 00:31:28.039
them out really quickly and so there's
some things in this app where I'm

00:31:28.039 --> 00:31:28.049
some things in this app where I'm
 

00:31:28.049 --> 00:31:30.049
some things in this app where I'm
thinking wow I this is exactly the

00:31:30.049 --> 00:31:30.059
thinking wow I this is exactly the
 

00:31:30.059 --> 00:31:31.909
thinking wow I this is exactly the
feature that I wanted but I didn't even

00:31:31.909 --> 00:31:31.919
feature that I wanted but I didn't even
 

00:31:31.919 --> 00:31:34.129
feature that I wanted but I didn't even
realize it exists and I think that's

00:31:34.129 --> 00:31:34.139
realize it exists and I think that's
 

00:31:34.139 --> 00:31:35.840
realize it exists and I think that's
really the challenge for trying to

00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:35.850
really the challenge for trying to
 

00:31:35.850 --> 00:31:38.509
really the challenge for trying to
monetize your apps in Google Play is to

00:31:38.509 --> 00:31:38.519
monetize your apps in Google Play is to
 

00:31:38.519 --> 00:31:41.210
monetize your apps in Google Play is to
convert people that need what you're

00:31:41.210 --> 00:31:41.220
convert people that need what you're
 

00:31:41.220 --> 00:31:44.869
convert people that need what you're
selling and want exactly what you offer

00:31:44.869 --> 00:31:44.879
selling and want exactly what you offer
 

00:31:44.879 --> 00:31:47.840
selling and want exactly what you offer

00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:47.850
but don't realize that you're the guy
 

00:31:47.850 --> 00:31:48.680
but don't realize that you're the guy
that's going to give it to them

00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:48.690
that's going to give it to them
 

00:31:48.690 --> 00:31:50.599
that's going to give it to them
absolutely it's that you have like that

00:31:50.599 --> 00:31:50.609
absolutely it's that you have like that
 

00:31:50.609 --> 00:31:52.580
absolutely it's that you have like that
1020 seconds when they first load the

00:31:52.580 --> 00:31:52.590
1020 seconds when they first load the
 

00:31:52.590 --> 00:31:54.049
1020 seconds when they first load the
app to convince them that this is the

00:31:54.049 --> 00:31:54.059
app to convince them that this is the
 

00:31:54.059 --> 00:31:55.700
app to convince them that this is the
app that you need stop looking at

00:31:55.700 --> 00:31:55.710
app that you need stop looking at
 

00:31:55.710 --> 00:31:57.320
app that you need stop looking at
everything else and that's that's a real

00:31:57.320 --> 00:31:57.330
everything else and that's that's a real
 

00:31:57.330 --> 00:32:01.639
everything else and that's that's a real

point out was just the navigation so the

00:34:59.890 --> 00:34:59.900
point out was just the navigation so the
 

00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:02.760
point out was just the navigation so the
one could the non-visual concern was

00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:02.770
one could the non-visual concern was

navigation was in the menu button in the

00:35:05.050 --> 00:35:05.060
navigation was in the menu button in the
 

00:35:05.060 --> 00:35:07.660
navigation was in the menu button in the
legacy menu button and that just it's

00:35:07.660 --> 00:35:07.670
legacy menu button and that just it's
 

00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:09.820
legacy menu button and that just it's
kind of difficult I think that it's it's

00:35:09.820 --> 00:35:09.830
kind of difficult I think that it's it's
 

00:35:09.830 --> 00:35:12.580
kind of difficult I think that it's it's
difficult to discover for users and it's

00:35:12.580 --> 00:35:12.590
difficult to discover for users and it's
 

00:35:12.590 --> 00:35:14.350
difficult to discover for users and it's
a it's kind of like a mosh ponch of

00:35:14.350 --> 00:35:14.360
a it's kind of like a mosh ponch of
 

00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:17.740
a it's kind of like a mosh ponch of
navigation and actions and so in the

00:35:17.740 --> 00:35:17.750
navigation and actions and so in the
 

00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:19.750
navigation and actions and so in the
redesign that I did what's probably more

00:35:19.750 --> 00:35:19.760
redesign that I did what's probably more
 

00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:21.640
redesign that I did what's probably more
important than the the visual language

00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:21.650
important than the the visual language
 

00:35:21.650 --> 00:35:24.340
important than the the visual language
change was just the be bringing up the

00:35:24.340 --> 00:35:24.350
change was just the be bringing up the
 

00:35:24.350 --> 00:35:26.470
change was just the be bringing up the
navigation more forward and an

00:35:26.470 --> 00:35:26.480
navigation more forward and an
 

00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:28.300
navigation more forward and an
immediately up front for the users so

00:35:28.300 --> 00:35:28.310
immediately up front for the users so
 

00:35:28.310 --> 00:35:29.440
immediately up front for the users so
the ability to toggle between a

00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:29.450
the ability to toggle between a
 

00:35:29.450 --> 00:35:33.040
the ability to toggle between a
stopwatch enough at a timer and the

00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:33.050
stopwatch enough at a timer and the
 

00:35:33.050 --> 00:35:35.230
stopwatch enough at a timer and the
ability to swipe very quickly between

00:35:35.230 --> 00:35:35.240
ability to swipe very quickly between
 

00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:38.320
ability to swipe very quickly between
laps and and the current stopwatch

00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:38.330
laps and and the current stopwatch
 

00:35:38.330 --> 00:35:40.390
laps and and the current stopwatch
valued oh it so they agree i think

00:35:40.390 --> 00:35:40.400
valued oh it so they agree i think
 

00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:42.190
valued oh it so they agree i think
that's one of the big improvements i

00:35:42.190 --> 00:35:42.200
that's one of the big improvements i
 

00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:43.810
that's one of the big improvements i
think you know in terms of the actual

00:35:43.810 --> 00:35:43.820
think you know in terms of the actual
 

00:35:43.820 --> 00:35:46.240
think you know in terms of the actual
look of the timer itself i think you

00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:46.250
look of the timer itself i think you
 

00:35:46.250 --> 00:35:47.320
look of the timer itself i think you
know that could definitely go either way

00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:47.330
know that could definitely go either way
 

00:35:47.330 --> 00:35:49.810
know that could definitely go either way
i quite like Romans redesigning that it

00:35:49.810 --> 00:35:49.820

i quite like Romans redesigning that it
looks like something which would ship

00:35:51.220 --> 00:35:51.230
looks like something which would ship
 

00:35:51.230 --> 00:35:53.830
looks like something which would ship
with the phone if we had a time or a

00:35:53.830 --> 00:35:53.840
with the phone if we had a time or a
 

00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:55.210
with the phone if we had a time or a
stopwatch built-in I reckon it would

00:35:55.210 --> 00:35:55.220
stopwatch built-in I reckon it would
 

00:35:55.220 --> 00:35:56.920
stopwatch built-in I reckon it would
look a lot like that although it would

00:35:56.920 --> 00:35:56.930
look a lot like that although it would
 

00:35:56.930 --> 00:35:59.440
look a lot like that although it would
probably be blue rather than orange yeah

00:35:59.440 --> 00:35:59.450
probably be blue rather than orange yeah
 

00:35:59.450 --> 00:36:00.940

00:36:35.260 --> 00:36:35.270
looking at the the initial screen on the
 

00:36:35.270 --> 00:36:37.060
looking at the the initial screen on the
left here and then on the right we're

00:36:37.060 --> 00:36:37.070
left here and then on the right we're
 

00:36:37.070 --> 00:36:40.540
left here and then on the right we're
looking at that's the laps right I and I

00:36:40.540 --> 00:36:40.550
looking at that's the laps right I and I
 

00:36:40.550 --> 00:36:45.430
looking at that's the laps right I and I
I greatly prefer Romans redesign of that

00:36:45.430 --> 00:36:45.440
I greatly prefer Romans redesign of that
 

00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:47.710
I greatly prefer Romans redesign of that
screen I felt like the original screen

00:36:47.710 --> 00:36:47.720
screen I felt like the original screen
 

00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:50.230
screen I felt like the original screen
had too much information compacted into

00:36:50.230 --> 00:36:50.240
had too much information compacted into
 

00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:52.750
had too much information compacted into
too small an area and you know that one

00:36:52.750 --> 00:36:52.760
too small an area and you know that one
 

00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:55.630
too small an area and you know that one
of my pet peeves is repeating gradient

00:36:55.630 --> 00:36:55.640
of my pet peeves is repeating gradient
 

00:36:55.640 --> 00:36:58.390
of my pet peeves is repeating gradient
designs or lists I'm I feel like that up

00:36:58.390 --> 00:36:58.400
designs or lists I'm I feel like that up
 

00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:01.780
designs or lists I'm I feel like that up
a lot yeah that ship has sailed I feel

00:37:01.780 --> 00:37:01.790
a lot yeah that ship has sailed I feel
 

00:37:01.790 --> 00:37:04.060
a lot yeah that ship has sailed I feel
the same way about the gradients on the

00:37:04.060 --> 00:37:04.070
the same way about the gradients on the
 

00:37:04.070 --> 00:37:08.080
the same way about the gradients on the
top of the the left hand screen

00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:08.090
top of the the left hand screen
 

00:37:08.090 --> 00:37:14.470
top of the the left hand screen
were these these sort of like uh um you

00:37:14.470 --> 00:37:14.480
were these these sort of like uh um you
 

00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:17.200
were these these sort of like uh um you
know pipe effect yeah i think is feel

00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:17.210
know pipe effect yeah i think is feel
 

00:37:17.210 --> 00:37:19.800
know pipe effect yeah i think is feel
feels just a little oil it feels less

00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:19.810
feels just a little oil it feels less
 

00:37:19.810 --> 00:37:23.770
feels just a little oil it feels less
designed than the main clock which looks

00:37:23.770 --> 00:37:23.780
designed than the main clock which looks
 

00:37:23.780 --> 00:37:27.280
designed than the main clock which looks
amazing it uses gradients to give a very

00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:27.290
amazing it uses gradients to give a very
 

00:37:27.290 --> 00:37:29.800
amazing it uses gradients to give a very
realistic lighting effect on what looks

00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:29.810
realistic lighting effect on what looks
 

00:37:29.810 --> 00:37:32.470
realistic lighting effect on what looks
like a beautiful you know timepiece oh

00:37:32.470 --> 00:37:32.480
like a beautiful you know timepiece oh
 

00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:34.120
like a beautiful you know timepiece oh
absolutely I would love a stopwatch

00:37:34.120 --> 00:37:34.130
absolutely I would love a stopwatch
 

00:37:34.130 --> 00:37:35.920
absolutely I would love a stopwatch
which look like that now I can have her

00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:35.930
which look like that now I can have her
 

00:37:35.930 --> 00:37:38.110
which look like that now I can have her
there you go yeah so I think you know

00:37:38.110 --> 00:37:38.120
there you go yeah so I think you know
 

00:37:38.120 --> 00:37:39.880
there you go yeah so I think you know
from my perspective I I'd kind of like

00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:39.890
from my perspective I I'd kind of like
 

00:37:39.890 --> 00:37:41.350
from my perspective I I'd kind of like
to see like I agree again with the

00:37:41.350 --> 00:37:41.360
to see like I agree again with the
 

00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:42.940
to see like I agree again with the
navigation i think is much simpler the

00:37:42.940 --> 00:37:42.950
navigation i think is much simpler the
 

00:37:42.950 --> 00:37:44.560
navigation i think is much simpler the
discoverability of the stopwatch and

00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:44.570
discoverability of the stopwatch and
 

00:37:44.570 --> 00:37:46.150
discoverability of the stopwatch and
timer in the laps and so on from the

00:37:46.150 --> 00:37:46.160
timer in the laps and so on from the
 

00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:48.910
timer in the laps and so on from the
original design is suboptimal I think

00:37:48.910 --> 00:37:48.920
original design is suboptimal I think
 

00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:51.220
original design is suboptimal I think
but having that beautiful skeuomorphic

00:37:51.220 --> 00:37:51.230
but having that beautiful skeuomorphic
 

00:37:51.230 --> 00:37:53.380
but having that beautiful skeuomorphic

that Roman suggested I think would be a
 

00:37:55.130 --> 00:37:59.500
that Roman suggested I think would be a
really nice sort of compromise so what

00:37:59.500 --> 00:37:59.510
really nice sort of compromise so what
 

00:37:59.510 --> 00:38:02.470
really nice sort of compromise so what
do you think havia you know is does the

00:38:02.470 --> 00:38:02.480
do you think havia you know is does the
 

00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:04.090
do you think havia you know is does the
air as the navigation alternative the

00:38:04.090 --> 00:38:04.100
air as the navigation alternative the

just really happy with the way that the
 

00:38:10.430 --> 00:38:12.220
just really happy with the way that the
app works now and think we should just

00:38:12.220 --> 00:38:12.230
app works now and think we should just
 

00:38:12.230 --> 00:38:17.320

definitely some of the elements can kind

00:38:59.120 --> 00:38:59.130
definitely some of the elements can kind
 

00:38:59.130 --> 00:39:01.640
definitely some of the elements can kind
of be merged in for sure very cool yeah

00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:01.650
of be merged in for sure very cool yeah
 

00:39:01.650 --> 00:39:03.290
of be merged in for sure very cool yeah
I mean I think this is this is an app

00:39:03.290 --> 00:39:03.300
I mean I think this is this is an app
 

00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:05.090
I mean I think this is this is an app
that really looks great that that does

00:39:05.090 --> 00:39:05.100
that really looks great that that does
 

00:39:05.100 --> 00:39:08.390
that really looks great that that does
the basics really really well and I mean

00:39:08.390 --> 00:39:08.400
the basics really really well and I mean
 

00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:09.830
the basics really really well and I mean
it's just got such a stunning look and

00:39:09.830 --> 00:39:09.840
it's just got such a stunning look and
 

00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:11.060
it's just got such a stunning look and
weight and it really does that mean it

00:39:11.060 --> 00:39:11.070
weight and it really does that mean it
 

00:39:11.070 --> 00:39:12.830
weight and it really does that mean it
is just incredible and remember to you

00:39:12.830 --> 00:39:12.840
is just incredible and remember to you
 

00:39:12.840 --> 00:39:14.570
is just incredible and remember to you
know a lot of people joke about

00:39:14.570 --> 00:39:14.580
know a lot of people joke about
 

00:39:14.580 --> 00:39:18.320
know a lot of people joke about
skeuomorphism but usually the objections

00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:18.330
skeuomorphism but usually the objections
 

00:39:18.330 --> 00:39:22.190
skeuomorphism but usually the objections
are that it doesn't add anything or that

00:39:22.190 --> 00:39:22.200
are that it doesn't add anything or that
 

00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:23.990
are that it doesn't add anything or that
it actually makes things ugly or that it

00:39:23.990 --> 00:39:24.000
it actually makes things ugly or that it
 

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:26.030
it actually makes things ugly or that it
makes things confusing or that's

00:39:26.030 --> 00:39:26.040
makes things confusing or that's
 

00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:27.950
makes things confusing or that's
presenting an interface that people may

00:39:27.950 --> 00:39:27.960
presenting an interface that people may
 

00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:30.740
presenting an interface that people may
not even be familiar with because they

00:39:30.740 --> 00:39:30.750
not even be familiar with because they
 

00:39:30.750 --> 00:39:32.900
not even be familiar with because they
haven't grown up using the original

00:39:32.900 --> 00:39:32.910
haven't grown up using the original
 

00:39:32.910 --> 00:39:35.030
haven't grown up using the original
equipment that the skeuomorph isn't

00:39:35.030 --> 00:39:35.040
equipment that the skeuomorph isn't
 

00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:37.580
equipment that the skeuomorph isn't
based on its like none of those apply

00:39:37.580 --> 00:39:37.590
based on its like none of those apply
 

00:39:37.590 --> 00:39:40.220
based on its like none of those apply
here I think that like you said I mean

00:39:40.220 --> 00:39:40.230
here I think that like you said I mean
 

00:39:40.230 --> 00:39:42.170
here I think that like you said I mean
this is something that I'm really happy

00:39:42.170 --> 00:39:42.180
this is something that I'm really happy
 

00:39:42.180 --> 00:39:44.180
this is something that I'm really happy
looking at and i would love to explore

00:39:44.180 --> 00:39:44.190
looking at and i would love to explore
 

00:39:44.190 --> 00:39:47.900
looking at and i would love to explore
more of how to do that sort of thing but

00:39:47.900 --> 00:39:47.910
more of how to do that sort of thing but
 

00:39:47.910 --> 00:39:50.900
more of how to do that sort of thing but
maintain all of the android-navigation

00:39:50.900 --> 00:39:50.910
maintain all of the android-navigation
 

00:39:50.910 --> 00:39:55.120
maintain all of the android-navigation
cues and you IQs that that we're used to

00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:55.130
cues and you IQs that that we're used to
 

00:39:55.130 --> 00:39:59.030
cues and you IQs that that we're used to
in in other apps yeah in general i think

00:39:59.030 --> 00:39:59.040
in in other apps yeah in general i think
 

00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:00.860
in in other apps yeah in general i think
it's it's really interesting to look at

00:40:00.860 --> 00:40:00.870
it's it's really interesting to look at
 

00:40:00.870 --> 00:40:03.680
it's it's really interesting to look at
both styles together and see how you can

00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:03.690
both styles together and see how you can
 

00:40:03.690 --> 00:40:04.910
both styles together and see how you can
accomplish the same thing in different

00:40:04.910 --> 00:40:04.920
accomplish the same thing in different
 

00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:06.590
accomplish the same thing in different
ways yeah absolutely i think this

00:40:06.590 --> 00:40:06.600
ways yeah absolutely i think this
 

00:40:06.600 --> 00:40:07.760
ways yeah absolutely i think this
actually brings up a really good point

00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:07.770
actually brings up a really good point
 

00:40:07.770 --> 00:40:10.220
actually brings up a really good point
that we sort of allude to during the app

00:40:10.220 --> 00:40:10.230
that we sort of allude to during the app
 

00:40:10.230 --> 00:40:12.140
that we sort of allude to during the app
clinic quite often which is if you're

00:40:12.140 --> 00:40:12.150
clinic quite often which is if you're
 

00:40:12.150 --> 00:40:14.120
clinic quite often which is if you're
going to do something that looks the

00:40:14.120 --> 00:40:14.130
going to do something that looks the
 

00:40:14.130 --> 00:40:15.890
going to do something that looks the
same it should work the same but you can

00:40:15.890 --> 00:40:15.900
same it should work the same but you can
 

00:40:15.900 --> 00:40:17.450
same it should work the same but you can
do something totally different and as

00:40:17.450 --> 00:40:17.460
do something totally different and as
 

00:40:17.460 --> 00:40:20.150
do something totally different and as
long as it looks good that's sweet and

00:40:20.150 --> 00:40:20.160
long as it looks good that's sweet and
 

00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:21.140
long as it looks good that's sweet and
so I think that's what we're kind of

00:40:21.140 --> 00:40:21.150
so I think that's what we're kind of
 

00:40:21.150 --> 00:40:22.430
so I think that's what we're kind of
talking about with this app where the

00:40:22.430 --> 00:40:22.440
talking about with this app where the
 

00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:24.620
talking about with this app where the
actual timer itself you know all this

00:40:24.620 --> 00:40:24.630
actual timer itself you know all this
 

00:40:24.630 --> 00:40:27.470
actual timer itself you know all this
stuff here looks fantastic it and it's

00:40:27.470 --> 00:40:27.480
stuff here looks fantastic it and it's
 

00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:28.820
stuff here looks fantastic it and it's
intuitive and we've been working on

00:40:28.820 --> 00:40:28.830
intuitive and we've been working on
 

00:40:28.830 --> 00:40:31.850
intuitive and we've been working on
clock design for a fair number of years

00:40:31.850 --> 00:40:31.860
clock design for a fair number of years
 

00:40:31.860 --> 00:40:34.640
clock design for a fair number of years
so it is something that people can into

00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:34.650
so it is something that people can into
 

00:40:34.650 --> 00:40:36.680
so it is something that people can into
it pretty well it's matter why it looks

00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:36.690
it pretty well it's matter why it looks
 

00:40:36.690 --> 00:40:39.590
it pretty well it's matter why it looks
that way the things like navigation you

00:40:39.590 --> 00:40:39.600
that way the things like navigation you
 

00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:40.730
that way the things like navigation you
know that's going to be should be

00:40:40.730 --> 00:40:40.740
know that's going to be should be
 

00:40:40.740 --> 00:40:42.320
know that's going to be should be
consistent between apps you know you

00:40:42.320 --> 00:40:42.330
consistent between apps you know you
 

00:40:42.330 --> 00:40:43.820
consistent between apps you know you
want to be able to flip between apps and

00:40:43.820 --> 00:40:43.830
want to be able to flip between apps and
 

00:40:43.830 --> 00:40:45.180
want to be able to flip between apps and
be able to navigate and

00:40:45.180 --> 00:40:45.190
be able to navigate and
 

00:40:45.190 --> 00:40:47.069
be able to navigate and
find and discover things really easily

00:40:47.069 --> 00:40:47.079
find and discover things really easily
 

00:40:47.079 --> 00:40:49.680
find and discover things really easily
and so that's kind of the sort of

00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:49.690
and so that's kind of the sort of
 

00:40:49.690 --> 00:40:50.790
and so that's kind of the sort of
direction you want to take when you're

00:40:50.790 --> 00:40:50.800
direction you want to take when you're
 

00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:53.069
direction you want to take when you're
building an app is try and keep the the

00:40:53.069 --> 00:40:53.079
building an app is try and keep the the
 

00:40:53.079 --> 00:40:54.300
building an app is try and keep the the
standard things which are going to be

00:40:54.300 --> 00:40:54.310
standard things which are going to be
 

00:40:54.310 --> 00:40:56.430
standard things which are going to be
the same as because with a bunch of

00:40:56.430 --> 00:40:56.440
the same as because with a bunch of
 

00:40:56.440 --> 00:40:58.140
the same as because with a bunch of
other apps should be able to be accessed

00:40:58.140 --> 00:40:58.150
other apps should be able to be accessed
 

00:40:58.150 --> 00:41:00.270
other apps should be able to be accessed
and work the same and then things which

00:41:00.270 --> 00:41:00.280
and work the same and then things which
 

00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:01.920
and work the same and then things which
are unique to your app make them unique

00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:01.930
are unique to your app make them unique
 

00:41:01.930 --> 00:41:03.300
are unique to your app make them unique
make them beautiful I'm going to make

00:41:03.300 --> 00:41:03.310
make them beautiful I'm going to make
 

00:41:03.310 --> 00:41:05.460
make them beautiful I'm going to make
just one last comment and that's that

00:41:05.460 --> 00:41:05.470
just one last comment and that's that
 

00:41:05.470 --> 00:41:07.650
just one last comment and that's that
when I hit the set button I think this

00:41:07.650 --> 00:41:07.660
when I hit the set button I think this
 

00:41:07.660 --> 00:41:09.720
when I hit the set button I think this
is what I was most disappointed with is

00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:09.730
is what I was most disappointed with is
 

00:41:09.730 --> 00:41:12.809
is what I was most disappointed with is
that we have a first off this is a less

00:41:12.809 --> 00:41:12.819
that we have a first off this is a less
 

00:41:12.819 --> 00:41:15.240
that we have a first off this is a less
usable interface than the current and

00:41:15.240 --> 00:41:15.250
usable interface than the current and
 

00:41:15.250 --> 00:41:19.710
usable interface than the current and
spinner based interface it but also the

00:41:19.710 --> 00:41:19.720
spinner based interface it but also the
 

00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:21.630
spinner based interface it but also the
thing that kind of made me sad was we

00:41:21.630 --> 00:41:21.640
thing that kind of made me sad was we
 

00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:23.280
thing that kind of made me sad was we
have some really beautifully designed

00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:23.290
have some really beautifully designed
 

00:41:23.290 --> 00:41:26.490
have some really beautifully designed
buttons but then we also have this which

00:41:26.490 --> 00:41:26.500
buttons but then we also have this which
 

00:41:26.500 --> 00:41:28.920
buttons but then we also have this which
is you know beautiful in its own way but

00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:28.930
is you know beautiful in its own way but
 

00:41:28.930 --> 00:41:32.569
is you know beautiful in its own way but
jarring next to these and then these

00:41:32.569 --> 00:41:32.579
jarring next to these and then these
 

00:41:32.579 --> 00:41:35.940
jarring next to these and then these
stock buttons that I wish would just go

00:41:35.940 --> 00:41:35.950
stock buttons that I wish would just go
 

00:41:35.950 --> 00:41:38.190
stock buttons that I wish would just go
away forever so in case you guys kind of

00:41:38.190 --> 00:41:38.200
away forever so in case you guys kind of
 

00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:39.690
away forever so in case you guys kind of
see but we've actually got the the set

00:41:39.690 --> 00:41:39.700
see but we've actually got the the set
 

00:41:39.700 --> 00:41:43.890
see but we've actually got the the set
timer dialogue up which yet is it's

00:41:43.890 --> 00:41:43.900
timer dialogue up which yet is it's
 

00:41:43.900 --> 00:41:45.270
timer dialogue up which yet is it's
unfortunate it's kind of being

00:41:45.270 --> 00:41:45.280
unfortunate it's kind of being
 

00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:47.520
unfortunate it's kind of being
customized in a way that probably made

00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:47.530
customized in a way that probably made
 

00:41:47.530 --> 00:41:49.589
customized in a way that probably made
it look better on gingerbread or froyo

00:41:49.589 --> 00:41:49.599
it look better on gingerbread or froyo
 

00:41:49.599 --> 00:41:51.900
it look better on gingerbread or froyo
or whatever device that you are built it

00:41:51.900 --> 00:41:51.910
or whatever device that you are built it
 

00:41:51.910 --> 00:41:54.720
or whatever device that you are built it
on originally but now on a on a jelly

00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:54.730
on originally but now on a on a jelly
 

00:41:54.730 --> 00:41:56.819
on originally but now on a on a jelly
bean device it looks a little dated

00:41:56.819 --> 00:41:56.829
bean device it looks a little dated
 

00:41:56.829 --> 00:41:59.280
bean device it looks a little dated
really so this is one example where the

00:41:59.280 --> 00:41:59.290
really so this is one example where the
 

00:41:59.290 --> 00:42:00.870
really so this is one example where the
dialogue could probably a stop to the

00:42:00.870 --> 00:42:00.880
dialogue could probably a stop to the
 

00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:02.609
dialogue could probably a stop to the
defaults and you'd have a better looking

00:42:02.609 --> 00:42:02.619
defaults and you'd have a better looking
 

00:42:02.619 --> 00:42:05.700
defaults and you'd have a better looking
at yeah i think the the general rule is

00:42:05.700 --> 00:42:05.710
at yeah i think the the general rule is
 

00:42:05.710 --> 00:42:08.940
at yeah i think the the general rule is
that if you're going to use a custom

00:42:08.940 --> 00:42:08.950
that if you're going to use a custom
 

00:42:08.950 --> 00:42:10.829
that if you're going to use a custom
look and feel make sure that you use

00:42:10.829 --> 00:42:10.839
look and feel make sure that you use
 

00:42:10.839 --> 00:42:13.319
look and feel make sure that you use
that all the way throughout whatever

00:42:13.319 --> 00:42:13.329
that all the way throughout whatever
 

00:42:13.329 --> 00:42:16.650
that all the way throughout whatever
view you're modifying because if you

00:42:16.650 --> 00:42:16.660
view you're modifying because if you
 

00:42:16.660 --> 00:42:19.950
view you're modifying because if you
incorporate stock elements into a custom

00:42:19.950 --> 00:42:19.960
incorporate stock elements into a custom
 

00:42:19.960 --> 00:42:23.670
incorporate stock elements into a custom
look and feel then if the stock elements

00:42:23.670 --> 00:42:23.680
look and feel then if the stock elements
 

00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:25.050
look and feel then if the stock elements
ever change which of course they do

00:42:25.050 --> 00:42:25.060
ever change which of course they do
 

00:42:25.060 --> 00:42:26.700
ever change which of course they do
because a lot of times manufacturers

00:42:26.700 --> 00:42:26.710
because a lot of times manufacturers
 

00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:29.370
because a lot of times manufacturers
will put on their own elements etc then

00:42:29.370 --> 00:42:29.380
will put on their own elements etc then
 

00:42:29.380 --> 00:42:31.650
will put on their own elements etc then
you'll be stuck with elements that they

00:42:31.650 --> 00:42:31.660
you'll be stuck with elements that they
 

00:42:31.660 --> 00:42:34.950
you'll be stuck with elements that they
look out a place and jarring cool are we

00:42:34.950 --> 00:42:34.960
look out a place and jarring cool are we
 

00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:37.950
look out a place and jarring cool are we
I just mentioned that he agrees and he

00:42:37.950 --> 00:42:37.960
I just mentioned that he agrees and he
 

00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:39.599
I just mentioned that he agrees and he
doesn't want to change the time picker

00:42:39.599 --> 00:42:39.609
doesn't want to change the time picker
 

00:42:39.609 --> 00:42:41.819
doesn't want to change the time picker
awesome that's great I mean we're really

looking we're gonna keep an eye on this
 

00:42:42.940 --> 00:42:44.520
looking we're gonna keep an eye on this
one however yeah I think this is an app

00:42:44.520 --> 00:42:44.530
one however yeah I think this is an app
 

00:42:44.530 --> 00:42:46.650
one however yeah I think this is an app
which looks great has you know a huge

00:42:46.650 --> 00:42:46.660
which looks great has you know a huge
 

00:42:46.660 --> 00:42:47.970
which looks great has you know a huge
amount of potential for something which

00:42:47.970 --> 00:42:47.980
amount of potential for something which
 

00:42:47.980 --> 00:42:49.890
amount of potential for something which
is already really good so

00:42:49.890 --> 00:42:49.900
is already really good so
