will be perceived by some critical mass
 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:19.530

that when people feel that they are
personally threatened that they're

personally threatened that they're
 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:37.889
personally threatened that they're
personally in risk that there is a

personally in risk that there is a
 

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:40.459
personally in risk that there is a
tendency to dispense with those rights

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469
tendency to dispense with those rights
 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.680

them against you know another targeted
group of people and you feel that

group of people and you feel that
 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.250
group of people and you feel that

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:50.260
somehow by targeting those other people

somehow by targeting those other people
you're not really jeopardizing your

00:00:51.959 --> 00:00:51.969
you're not really jeopardizing your
 

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:53.729
you're not really jeopardizing your
rights I'm I think about this in the

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:53.739
rights I'm I think about this in the
 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:57.450
rights I'm I think about this in the
context of 911 where there was a broad

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:57.460
context of 911 where there was a broad
 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.700
context of 911 where there was a broad
feeling in the united states that you

00:00:59.700 --> 00:00:59.710
feeling in the united states that you
 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:01.439
feeling in the united states that you
know maybe torture was okay you know

00:01:01.439 --> 00:01:01.449
know maybe torture was okay you know
 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:03.059
know maybe torture was okay you know
maybe it was okay to imprison people

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:03.069
maybe it was okay to imprison people
 

00:01:03.069 --> 00:01:06.209
maybe it was okay to imprison people
without trial because after all our

00:01:06.209 --> 00:01:06.219
without trial because after all our
 

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:08.399
without trial because after all our
lives are at risk and the people that

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:08.409
lives are at risk and the people that
 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:09.539
lives are at risk and the people that
we're targeting those are those other

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:09.549
we're targeting those are those other
 

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:10.740
we're targeting those are those other
people you know they're they're they're

the middle east or south asia they're
young males there a discrete group of

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:16.299
young males there a discrete group of

were not me and won't become me and

were not me and won't become me and
 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.350
were not me and won't become me and
therefore my rights aren't at risk when

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.360
therefore my rights aren't at risk when
 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.719
therefore my rights aren't at risk when
I jeopardize their rights and it's that

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:24.729
I jeopardize their rights and it's that
 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:27.480
I jeopardize their rights and it's that
kind of willingness to compromise under

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490
kind of willingness to compromise under
 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.300
kind of willingness to compromise under
threat that I worry about I do think

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310
threat that I worry about I do think
 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.490
threat that I worry about I do think
that America has moved a long way since

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:32.500
that America has moved a long way since
 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.219
that America has moved a long way since
then and is recognized that the initial

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:35.229
then and is recognized that the initial
 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:38.490
then and is recognized that the initial
reaction in 911 was an overreaction much

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500
reaction in 911 was an overreaction much
 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.830
reaction in 911 was an overreaction much
the way see the we now look back to the

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840
the way see the we now look back to the
 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.660
the way see the we now look back to the
Japanese internment during World War two

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670
Japanese internment during World War two
 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.779
Japanese internment during World War two
as a mistake is an over reaction to the

00:01:45.779 --> 00:01:45.789
as a mistake is an over reaction to the
 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:47.870
as a mistake is an over reaction to the
threats of the Japanese attack

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880
threats of the Japanese attack
 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.080
threats of the Japanese attack
on Pearl Harbor so I hope that the

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090
on Pearl Harbor so I hope that the
 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.480
on Pearl Harbor so I hope that the
nation has gained the wisdom of a little

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490
nation has gained the wisdom of a little
 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.580
nation has gained the wisdom of a little
distance but inevitably there's going to

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590
distance but inevitably there's going to
 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:56.929
distance but inevitably there's going to
be another terrorist attack and

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939
be another terrorist attack and
 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.370
be another terrorist attack and
inevitably people are going to be

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380
inevitably people are going to be
 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.310
inevitably people are going to be
fearful again and so what I worry about

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320
fearful again and so what I worry about
 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.330
fearful again and so what I worry about
is the extent to which those fears will

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340
is the extent to which those fears will
 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.449
is the extent to which those fears will
countenance further compromises in basic

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459
countenance further compromises in basic
 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.550
countenance further compromises in basic
rights because if we lose the West as a

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560
rights because if we lose the West as a
 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.490
rights because if we lose the West as a
group of people who stand behind these

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500
group of people who stand behind these
 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.030
group of people who stand behind these
basic rights I think we risk setting

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040
basic rights I think we risk setting
 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.910
basic rights I think we risk setting
back the movement tremendously the human

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920
back the movement tremendously the human
 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.470
back the movement tremendously the human
rights movement has taken hold around

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480
rights movement has taken hold around
 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.360
rights movement has taken hold around
the world but we have to recognize that

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370
the world but we have to recognize that
 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.089
the world but we have to recognize that
that in the face of dictators and

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099
that in the face of dictators and
 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:31.640
that in the face of dictators and
tyrants the West is often the most

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650
tyrants the West is often the most
 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.750
tyrants the West is often the most
important defense and if the Western

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760
important defense and if the Western
 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.500
important defense and if the Western
defense waivers because it's not so sure

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510
defense waivers because it's not so sure
 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:40.759
defense waivers because it's not so sure
that these rights are of paramount

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769
that these rights are of paramount
 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:42.979
that these rights are of paramount
importance in light of other threats and

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989
importance in light of other threats and
 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:45.319
importance in light of other threats and
concerns I think the whole movement will

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:45.329
concerns I think the whole movement will
 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:47.750
concerns I think the whole movement will
be very much
