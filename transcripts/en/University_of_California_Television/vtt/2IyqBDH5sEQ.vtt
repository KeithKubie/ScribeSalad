(beeping)

00:00:05.358 --> 00:00:09.108
(inspirational techno music)

00:00:21.853 --> 00:00:23.060
- What I'm gonna try to do

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.060
is to tell you what the challenge is

00:00:27.548 --> 00:00:29.436
and how far we've gotten.

00:00:29.436 --> 00:00:31.686
First of all, this diagram,

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:35.916
which Pat Churchland and I first published

00:00:35.916 --> 00:00:39.187
in our book in 1992,
The Computational Brain,

00:00:39.187 --> 00:00:42.646
illustrates the real difficulty here,

00:00:42.646 --> 00:00:44.890
because there's 11 orders
of spacial magnitude

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.150
between molecules down
here at the very bottom

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:50.485
and the entire central nervous system

00:00:50.485 --> 00:00:52.097
that gives rise to behavior

00:00:52.097 --> 00:00:55.514
up at the very top at the meter of scale.

00:00:56.533 --> 00:01:00.203
And we've heard talks today
at every one of these levels.

00:01:00.203 --> 00:01:02.442
We've heard about hormones,

00:01:02.442 --> 00:01:05.359
the important impact that they have

00:01:06.451 --> 00:01:09.461
on remodeling the brain,
especially during adolescence.

00:01:09.461 --> 00:01:12.759
Synapses, we've heard that pruning

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:14.428
may be of critical importance,

00:01:14.428 --> 00:01:17.175
both in the development
and then degeneration.

00:01:17.175 --> 00:01:19.553
So that's clearly very important,

00:01:19.553 --> 00:01:22.710
and understanding how the molecules

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.365
at the synapses in particular

00:01:24.365 --> 00:01:28.575
are responsible for
maturation is critical.

00:01:28.575 --> 00:01:32.818
We know that there are
changes occurring in networks.

00:01:32.818 --> 00:01:36.735
For example, we heard
about the impact of sound

00:01:39.451 --> 00:01:43.766
on the maturation of a
baby's auditory system

00:01:43.766 --> 00:01:45.849
and how important that was

00:01:45.849 --> 00:01:49.516
for being able to later
have normal language

00:01:51.513 --> 00:01:53.664
and learning ability.

00:01:53.664 --> 00:01:55.799
If you can't hear properly,

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.116
then it's very difficult to
know what people are saying,

00:01:59.116 --> 00:02:01.647
and especially if you
start going to school,

00:02:01.647 --> 00:02:04.395
it puts you at a great disadvantage.

00:02:04.395 --> 00:02:06.805
We heard about the brain imaging,

00:02:06.805 --> 00:02:08.856
the important technique that allows us

00:02:08.856 --> 00:02:13.642
to tap into large scale
patterns of brain activity.

00:02:13.642 --> 00:02:15.159
But how do you jump from

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:18.691
these large scale patterns
way up here, global activity,

00:02:18.691 --> 00:02:22.816
down all the way through all
the systems and the maps?

00:02:22.816 --> 00:02:25.472
We heard about visual system

00:02:25.472 --> 00:02:28.091
is a sequence of maps from
primary visual cortex,

00:02:28.091 --> 00:02:31.611
dozens, up to the very higher areas

00:02:31.611 --> 00:02:35.778
that are responsible for being
able to recognize objects.

00:02:37.153 --> 00:02:39.622
How are we gonna connect the dots

00:02:39.622 --> 00:02:41.770
between all these areas?

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.318
That's really the challenge.

00:02:44.318 --> 00:02:46.394
And it's not gonna be necessarily

00:02:46.394 --> 00:02:48.259
jumping from molecules to CNS,

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:50.463
although we'd always like the magic pill

00:02:50.463 --> 00:02:53.289
that is targeting a specific molecule

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:55.813
and then hoping that that
will solve everything.

00:02:55.813 --> 00:02:58.824
I don't think that's a good model.

00:02:58.824 --> 00:03:03.602
The fact that we've had
how many clinical trials

00:03:03.602 --> 00:03:05.175
for Alzheimer's that have failed

00:03:05.175 --> 00:03:09.205
in the last two or three years
is at least a dozen trials

00:03:09.205 --> 00:03:12.063
saying that amyloid plaque by itself,

00:03:12.063 --> 00:03:13.728
getting rid of it isn't necessarily

00:03:13.728 --> 00:03:16.535
the way to solve the problem.

00:03:16.535 --> 00:03:17.871
Now there's something missing from this,

00:03:17.871 --> 00:03:20.778
and I have to say that
there's a lot missing from it,

00:03:20.778 --> 00:03:22.423
but just from today's talks

00:03:22.423 --> 00:03:24.789
I think you've heard that we have to add

00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:28.706
at least one more type
of cell to this diagram.

00:03:29.591 --> 00:03:32.321
Half the cells in your
brain are glial cells,

00:03:32.321 --> 00:03:34.452
and in particular there's the astrocytes.

00:03:34.452 --> 00:03:36.085
We've heard a lot about the microglia.

00:03:36.085 --> 00:03:37.802
The oligdendrocytes are
very important, too,

00:03:37.802 --> 00:03:39.954
because they're the ones
that wrap around the axons

00:03:39.954 --> 00:03:42.913
and they speed the action
potential down the axons.

00:03:42.913 --> 00:03:44.618
That has to do with timing,

00:03:44.618 --> 00:03:47.019
and so we really have to
put them front and center

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:48.063
if we're gonna especially understand

00:03:48.063 --> 00:03:51.146
something about when things go wrong.

00:03:52.143 --> 00:03:53.893
Now when I was young,

00:03:57.325 --> 00:04:01.338
I was told that space
is the final frontier

00:04:01.338 --> 00:04:03.224
from watching Star Trek.

00:04:03.224 --> 00:04:05.595
(audience laughs)

00:04:05.595 --> 00:04:07.195
But I now come to believe

00:04:07.195 --> 00:04:10.862
that the final frontier
is going to be time,

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.149
understanding how the temporal processing

00:04:15.149 --> 00:04:16.341
occurring in different circuits

00:04:16.341 --> 00:04:20.642
and delays that occur
between communication,

00:04:20.642 --> 00:04:22.258
between different parts of the brain,

00:04:22.258 --> 00:04:23.849
may be critically important.

00:04:23.849 --> 00:04:25.048
We've neglected it,

00:04:25.048 --> 00:04:27.961
so I've worked on networks
for my entire career,

00:04:27.961 --> 00:04:29.624
and I've always thought of networks

00:04:29.624 --> 00:04:32.734
as being the tightly
interconnected group of neurons,

00:04:32.734 --> 00:04:34.295
typically in the cortex,

00:04:34.295 --> 00:04:37.526
a single neuron connecting
to 10,000 neighbors,

00:04:37.526 --> 00:04:39.555
and in a single column 100,000 neurons,

00:04:39.555 --> 00:04:42.055
and that adds up to at the end

00:04:44.242 --> 00:04:47.818
billions of synapses in a single column.

00:04:47.818 --> 00:04:49.796
But there's another kind of network,

00:04:49.796 --> 00:04:51.500
and that's a communication network.

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.147
A communication network
is the one that extends,

00:04:54.147 --> 00:04:57.004
broadcasts the signals in
your cell phones, right,

00:04:57.004 --> 00:05:00.029
are being broadcast through
a communication network,

00:05:00.029 --> 00:05:02.026
and the brain has one that
is just as sophisticated

00:05:02.026 --> 00:05:04.153
as anything that we've ever come across.

00:05:04.153 --> 00:05:06.923
But I want to take you
back to the early days

00:05:06.923 --> 00:05:09.340
when Carla was a young puppy,

00:05:11.038 --> 00:05:12.586
or young kitten, I guess.

00:05:12.586 --> 00:05:16.633
I'm not sure what would be
the proper way of putting it,

00:05:16.633 --> 00:05:21.465
which he made a very important (laughs),

00:05:21.465 --> 00:05:22.298
sorry, Carla.

00:05:22.298 --> 00:05:25.131
(audience laughs)

00:05:25.985 --> 00:05:28.347
It was a very important observation

00:05:28.347 --> 00:05:30.594
about traveling waves in the retina.

00:05:30.594 --> 00:05:32.715
The reason why it's
important is that these occur

00:05:32.715 --> 00:05:34.648
even before the eye opens,

00:05:34.648 --> 00:05:36.374
so there's dynamic patterns of activity

00:05:36.374 --> 00:05:39.174
that are already spreading
through the retina.

00:05:39.174 --> 00:05:41.693
And here you can see,

00:05:41.693 --> 00:05:43.184
this is now from a more recent paper,

00:05:43.184 --> 00:05:45.023
but this from an array of electrodes

00:05:45.023 --> 00:05:48.259
that are put on the retina
that's slapped down.

00:05:48.259 --> 00:05:49.755
And these are the action potentials

00:05:49.755 --> 00:05:51.332
coming from the ganglion cells.

00:05:51.332 --> 00:05:53.803
And you can see over seconds
this wave of activity

00:05:53.803 --> 00:05:54.684
sweeps across the retina.

00:05:54.684 --> 00:05:57.170
Now, why is that interesting?

00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:00.347
Well, it turns out that these waves

00:06:00.347 --> 00:06:02.922
are giving a temporal structure
to the action potentials

00:06:02.922 --> 00:06:05.525
going up to the next stage
in the lateral geniculate,

00:06:05.525 --> 00:06:07.892
and it's essential for
getting that pathway

00:06:07.892 --> 00:06:10.555
wired up properly, being able to sort out

00:06:10.555 --> 00:06:12.486
the input from the two eyes, first of all,

00:06:12.486 --> 00:06:14.034
'cause the waves are independent,

00:06:14.034 --> 00:06:16.444
but secondly is
information about location,

00:06:16.444 --> 00:06:20.956
because as the wave spreads
from one location to the next,

00:06:20.956 --> 00:06:24.648
the action potentials arrive
one position to the next,

00:06:24.648 --> 00:06:27.653
and that helps sort out the map in LGN

00:06:27.653 --> 00:06:30.775
and ultimately into the cortex.

00:06:30.775 --> 00:06:32.358
Now, very recently,

00:06:33.349 --> 00:06:36.932
we discovered waves in
the cerebral cortex,

00:06:39.431 --> 00:06:43.598
global waves, unbelievably
large scale patterns of activity

00:06:45.091 --> 00:06:49.037
that we still don't understand
the significance of,

00:06:49.037 --> 00:06:51.250
although I have a pretty good hypothesis,

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:54.492
and they occur while you are sleeping.

00:06:54.492 --> 00:06:56.589
When you go to sleep, you
go through several stages

00:06:56.589 --> 00:06:59.212
from awake down to deep slow wave sleep,

00:06:59.212 --> 00:07:01.165
but on the way, you go through stage two.

00:07:01.165 --> 00:07:03.059
It's called intermediate sleep,

00:07:03.059 --> 00:07:05.870
and it's characterized
by these sleep spindles.

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:09.144
These are bursting activity
that originates in the thalamus,

00:07:09.144 --> 00:07:10.833
projects to the cortex.

00:07:10.833 --> 00:07:13.621
They are 10 to 14 hertz.

00:07:13.621 --> 00:07:14.922
They last one or two seconds.

00:07:14.922 --> 00:07:16.821
They recur every five seconds.

00:07:16.821 --> 00:07:17.906
And there are some people who spend

00:07:17.906 --> 00:07:21.394
up to half of the night
in this slow wave sleep

00:07:21.394 --> 00:07:24.451
during which the spindles are occurring.

00:07:24.451 --> 00:07:27.619
Now, I've done some very
detailed biophysical modeling,

00:07:27.619 --> 00:07:29.940
so I can tell you precise mechanisms

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:31.264
that give rise to the spindles.

00:07:31.264 --> 00:07:32.586
It's a bursting.

00:07:32.586 --> 00:07:35.813
It has to do with new ion
channels that are uncovered

00:07:35.813 --> 00:07:39.001
when the cells hyper-polarize.

00:07:39.001 --> 00:07:41.861
It means that membrane
potential goes down.

00:07:41.861 --> 00:07:46.028
But what I would've never
guessed is how the activity

00:07:47.436 --> 00:07:50.943
between the thalamus and
the cortex organizes itself.

00:07:50.943 --> 00:07:53.554
In the textbooks, what you
hear is that it's synchronous.

00:07:53.554 --> 00:07:55.826
That is to say it occurs
the same place in the cortex

00:07:55.826 --> 00:07:57.655
at exactly the same time.

00:07:57.655 --> 00:07:59.600
And it is approximately synchronous.

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:01.497
But I wanted to let
you decide for yourself

00:08:01.497 --> 00:08:03.681
how synchronous it really is.

00:08:03.681 --> 00:08:05.179
So this is an array of electrodes,

00:08:05.179 --> 00:08:07.004
eight by eight, 64 electrodes,

00:08:07.004 --> 00:08:09.532
that have been placed on
the surface of the cortex

00:08:09.532 --> 00:08:13.307
in an epilepsy patient who
has gone to the hospital

00:08:13.307 --> 00:08:15.386
with a form of epilepsy

00:08:15.386 --> 00:08:17.614
that can't be treated with any drugs.

00:08:17.614 --> 00:08:19.892
And so what they have to
do is isolate the focus

00:08:19.892 --> 00:08:21.706
so they can go in and take it out

00:08:21.706 --> 00:08:25.873
and hopefully keep that person
from having seizures again.

00:08:26.752 --> 00:08:28.164
So here is the electrodes.

00:08:28.164 --> 00:08:29.812
And by the way, they
have these electrodes in

00:08:29.812 --> 00:08:32.531
for about a week waiting
for a seizure to occur,

00:08:32.531 --> 00:08:36.009
so it's a fantastic opportunity
for someone like me,

00:08:36.009 --> 00:08:38.599
a neuroscientist, who wants
to ask fundamental questions

00:08:38.599 --> 00:08:41.301
about a human brain,
about things like language

00:08:41.301 --> 00:08:44.885
for which there is no other model system.

00:08:44.885 --> 00:08:48.330
Okay, so what we've done
is color each in gray,

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:52.497
from white to black, as
you can see, the amplitude.

00:08:53.798 --> 00:08:55.971
And this is the one that
you're gonna see here in red,

00:08:55.971 --> 00:08:58.593
is this one, but all the other electrodes

00:08:58.593 --> 00:09:01.484
are gonna be represented that way,

00:09:01.484 --> 00:09:05.307
and I want you just to
follow the white dots

00:09:05.307 --> 00:09:08.224
and tell me what pattern they form.

00:09:13.779 --> 00:09:16.437
This is going around once
every 70 milliseconds, right?

00:09:16.437 --> 00:09:20.104
So this is going around
at roughly 14 hertz.

00:09:21.748 --> 00:09:24.998
And you can see as it goes up and down.

00:09:27.808 --> 00:09:30.475
So did everybody see what I saw?

00:09:31.526 --> 00:09:35.693
It's a rotating, circular,
traveling wave, and it's global.

00:09:38.175 --> 00:09:40.022
It goes from, as you can see,

00:09:40.022 --> 00:09:42.589
it goes from the temporal
cortex to the parietal cortex

00:09:42.589 --> 00:09:44.892
up to the prefrontal cortex.

00:09:44.892 --> 00:09:48.106
And if you look at the pattern
on the side of my head,

00:09:48.106 --> 00:09:50.311
this should remind of you Princess Leia.

00:09:50.311 --> 00:09:53.144
(audience laughs)

00:09:55.878 --> 00:09:57.948
So this occurs thousands
of times during the night.

00:09:57.948 --> 00:09:58.804
What is it doing?

00:09:58.804 --> 00:10:01.278
We think it has something to
do with synaptic plasticity,

00:10:01.278 --> 00:10:03.709
because the timing is just
right for something called

00:10:03.709 --> 00:10:05.661
spike-time-dependent plasticity.

00:10:05.661 --> 00:10:08.282
And so it may be that,
we know there's replay

00:10:08.282 --> 00:10:10.457
from the hippocampus during the night.

00:10:10.457 --> 00:10:12.369
It's called memory consolidation,

00:10:12.369 --> 00:10:14.369
and it occurs over many, many nights,

00:10:14.369 --> 00:10:16.033
and this might be the mechanism.

00:10:16.033 --> 00:10:18.234
So we have a really great opportunity here

00:10:18.234 --> 00:10:20.151
to actually explore it.

00:10:21.677 --> 00:10:26.080
Now, we know that there
are long range connections

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:27.474
between different parts of the cortex,

00:10:27.474 --> 00:10:29.078
these are called association fibers,

00:10:29.078 --> 00:10:32.677
and also across between the hemispheres.

00:10:32.677 --> 00:10:35.605
And it's really these that we think

00:10:35.605 --> 00:10:37.849
are carrying the time delayed signals.

00:10:37.849 --> 00:10:40.430
And it may be that these time
delays are really important,

00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:41.333
getting them right.

00:10:41.333 --> 00:10:44.647
We know that in, for example,
traumatic brain injury

00:10:44.647 --> 00:10:47.449
when soldiers come back
from the Middle East

00:10:47.449 --> 00:10:50.532
with traumatic problems with traumas,

00:10:51.691 --> 00:10:55.662
they often have problems with
concentration and attention,

00:10:55.662 --> 00:10:59.110
and concussions on football
players and so forth,

00:10:59.110 --> 00:11:01.269
and when you look in the brain with MR,

00:11:01.269 --> 00:11:02.102
the only thing you can find

00:11:02.102 --> 00:11:03.894
are little spots in the white matter.

00:11:03.894 --> 00:11:06.327
So, it could well be that the white matter

00:11:06.327 --> 00:11:08.752
is really important for
integrating globally

00:11:08.752 --> 00:11:11.026
all the information in
different parts of the cortex,

00:11:11.026 --> 00:11:13.842
and it could be that by
strengthening connections

00:11:13.842 --> 00:11:16.362
between these distant areas

00:11:16.362 --> 00:11:18.332
through spindles or some other mechanism

00:11:18.332 --> 00:11:21.470
that we're able to connect
up all the different parts

00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:23.557
of the sensory cortices and association

00:11:23.557 --> 00:11:26.270
in the prefrontal cortex.

00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:29.187
Now, the timing is also, obviously,

00:11:30.964 --> 00:11:32.640
very important in the auditory cortex

00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:33.841
and in the motor systems.

00:11:33.841 --> 00:11:37.641
So this is, I think, something
that hasn't been explored.

00:11:37.641 --> 00:11:40.085
We focus so much on the gray matter

00:11:40.085 --> 00:11:41.844
and not so much on the white matter.

00:11:41.844 --> 00:11:45.302
There are some really
intriguing observations that

00:11:45.302 --> 00:11:48.270
when learning takes place,
it's not just the synapses

00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:49.742
that change their strength,

00:11:49.742 --> 00:11:52.118
the volume of the white matter changes.

00:11:52.118 --> 00:11:53.687
How could that be?

00:11:53.687 --> 00:11:57.854
Well, the oligodendrocytes
that wrap around the axons

00:11:59.688 --> 00:12:00.742
change the speed.

00:12:00.742 --> 00:12:02.671
So maybe what's happening
is you're adjusting

00:12:02.671 --> 00:12:05.396
the timing of the spike as it goes across

00:12:05.396 --> 00:12:08.612
these large scale connections

00:12:08.612 --> 00:12:10.864
between different parts of the cortex.

00:12:10.864 --> 00:12:13.077
That's all speculative,
but I think it really means

00:12:13.077 --> 00:12:15.864
we have to start looking
carefully at the axons

00:12:15.864 --> 00:12:17.999
as well as the dendrites.

00:12:17.999 --> 00:12:22.166
Now, I'm gonna play a science
fiction movie for you.

00:12:23.222 --> 00:12:27.583
It's animated, but it's based
on the connections we see,

00:12:27.583 --> 00:12:29.827
and it also gives you,
you'll see an impression

00:12:29.827 --> 00:12:31.760
of the activity that might be taking place

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:33.338
within the cortex.

00:12:33.338 --> 00:12:35.755
So these little white flashes

00:12:38.467 --> 00:12:40.956
are actually action potentials, spikes,

00:12:40.956 --> 00:12:43.441
going down the axons that you just saw

00:12:43.441 --> 00:12:45.622
between these different cortical areas.

00:12:45.622 --> 00:12:47.345
And this gives you an
impression of what it might be

00:12:47.345 --> 00:12:51.020
if you could actually see into your brain,

00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:53.603
the person sitting next to you,

00:12:55.243 --> 00:12:57.786
and actually see what they're thinking

00:12:57.786 --> 00:13:01.953
or what they're seeing or
what it is that they're doing

00:13:03.359 --> 00:13:06.366
in terms of their motor system.

00:13:06.366 --> 00:13:08.573
Every single thought
is gonna be represented

00:13:08.573 --> 00:13:11.518
by some pattern of activity
in some part of your brain,

00:13:11.518 --> 00:13:15.689
and specifically in different
parts of the cortex.

00:13:15.689 --> 00:13:19.856
Now, right now this is
science fiction for the human,

00:13:22.597 --> 00:13:24.597
but, on April 2nd, 2013,

00:13:27.476 --> 00:13:30.824
Obama announced this grand initiative.

00:13:30.824 --> 00:13:35.256
These grand initiatives only
occur once every decade or two,

00:13:35.256 --> 00:13:37.663
and when they do, it really has an impact,

00:13:37.663 --> 00:13:40.337
and it has had a huge impact
on the neuroscience community

00:13:40.337 --> 00:13:43.126
over the last three years.

00:13:43.126 --> 00:13:46.601
The key letters, by the
way, in the acronym IN

00:13:46.601 --> 00:13:48.807
is innovative neurotechnology.

00:13:48.807 --> 00:13:52.168
And I have to say that our
sponsors, the Kavli Foundation,

00:13:52.168 --> 00:13:57.110
were critically important
in bringing this opportunity

00:13:57.110 --> 00:14:00.103
to the notice of the White House.

00:14:00.103 --> 00:14:02.444
And Miyoung Chun in
particular was the spark plug

00:14:02.444 --> 00:14:04.220
who actually got the thing off the ground,

00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:05.912
so we really owe the Kavli Foundation

00:14:05.912 --> 00:14:07.818
a great debt of gratitude.

00:14:07.818 --> 00:14:10.510
But what's happened
since this announcement

00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:11.836
is really astonishing,

00:14:11.836 --> 00:14:14.733
because new tools and
techniques are coming online

00:14:14.733 --> 00:14:18.568
that are accelerating research
by orders of magnitude,

00:14:18.568 --> 00:14:20.746
and let me give you one example.

00:14:20.746 --> 00:14:22.995
And this is not science fiction.

00:14:22.995 --> 00:14:24.078
This is real.

00:14:25.134 --> 00:14:29.051
This, you are seeing a
zebra fish larval brain.

00:14:30.518 --> 00:14:33.629
You could see, it's only
a millimeter or so across.

00:14:33.629 --> 00:14:35.753
It contains about 80,000 neurons.

00:14:35.753 --> 00:14:39.959
It has a genetic marker that
will light the neuron up

00:14:39.959 --> 00:14:40.957
when it's activated.

00:14:40.957 --> 00:14:44.475
So here's a neuron, here's
a neuron, here's a neuron.

00:14:44.475 --> 00:14:45.983
These are the ones that are firing

00:14:45.983 --> 00:14:47.799
at this particular moment in time,

00:14:47.799 --> 00:14:50.233
and this is looking at it from below,

00:14:50.233 --> 00:14:53.209
from above, from the
front, and from the side.

00:14:53.209 --> 00:14:55.891
We can record from all the neurons

00:14:55.891 --> 00:14:58.641
at the same time from this brain.

00:14:59.845 --> 00:15:03.678
And I'm gonna play a
movie just to prove that.

00:15:07.007 --> 00:15:08.328
Now, I hate to tell you this.

00:15:08.328 --> 00:15:11.427
This zebra fish larva
is just sitting there.

00:15:11.427 --> 00:15:14.817
It's immobilized, and
there's no sensory input.

00:15:14.817 --> 00:15:15.936
There's no light.

00:15:15.936 --> 00:15:19.292
So what you're seeing is
called spontaneous activity.

00:15:19.292 --> 00:15:23.008
But every once in a while,
the spontaneous activity,

00:15:23.008 --> 00:15:24.669
the pattern changes, like right there.

00:15:24.669 --> 00:15:25.869
What's happening?

00:15:25.869 --> 00:15:28.893
Something happened in the
brain of the zebra fish

00:15:28.893 --> 00:15:30.775
that is unrelated to anything

00:15:30.775 --> 00:15:34.942
that the zebra fish is
experiencing or is actually moving.

00:15:36.686 --> 00:15:38.519
But it's really clear,

00:15:41.671 --> 00:15:45.107
to me, at least, that we don't
understand the first thing.

00:15:45.107 --> 00:15:47.940
(audience laughs)

00:15:51.506 --> 00:15:54.733
It's a Chinese curse, "May
you get what you wish for,"

00:15:54.733 --> 00:15:56.646
and this is something we've always wanted,

00:15:56.646 --> 00:15:59.628
to be able to have access
to all of the neurons

00:15:59.628 --> 00:16:01.848
and the activity occurring.

00:16:01.848 --> 00:16:03.306
For all we know,

00:16:03.306 --> 00:16:05.436
this is what the zebra
fish does when it thinks.

00:16:05.436 --> 00:16:06.874
What do you do when you go to bed at night

00:16:06.874 --> 00:16:09.082
and you're sitting there, right?

00:16:09.082 --> 00:16:11.438
There's no sensory input
coming, you're not moving,

00:16:11.438 --> 00:16:12.962
but thoughts go through your head, right?

00:16:12.962 --> 00:16:14.642
So that's gotta be represented somewhere,

00:16:14.642 --> 00:16:17.349
so this is getting tools and techniques

00:16:17.349 --> 00:16:20.442
that allow us to decode
what those patterns are

00:16:20.442 --> 00:16:23.154
is really the challenge.

00:16:23.154 --> 00:16:26.391
And we're very fortunate
that tools and techniques

00:16:26.391 --> 00:16:29.412
are coming online exactly
when we needed them.

00:16:29.412 --> 00:16:30.860
It's called machine learning,

00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:33.535
and there's a meeting that's
been held for the last 30 years

00:16:33.535 --> 00:16:36.495
called Neural Information
Processing Systems, NIPS,

00:16:36.495 --> 00:16:40.685
and the next meeting will be
held in Barcelona next week.

00:16:40.685 --> 00:16:42.852
6,000 people will show up.

00:16:44.382 --> 00:16:46.002
At the first meeting, there were 600,

00:16:46.002 --> 00:16:48.834
so that's a factor of 10 greater.

00:16:48.834 --> 00:16:52.340
And every single high tech
company is showing up to recruit.

00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:53.173
And why?

00:16:53.173 --> 00:16:54.980
It turns out that these
tools and techniques

00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:56.063
that have been developed

00:16:56.063 --> 00:16:57.824
and have been inspired by the brain,

00:16:57.824 --> 00:17:00.657
the N is neural, it turns out have

00:17:02.334 --> 00:17:04.522
fantastic applications in the real world.

00:17:04.522 --> 00:17:05.926
You've heard about deep learning.

00:17:05.926 --> 00:17:08.983
Well, deep learning came
from this NIPS community.

00:17:08.983 --> 00:17:12.549
And, those same tools and
techniques can be used

00:17:12.549 --> 00:17:14.999
for understanding those
patterns of activity

00:17:14.999 --> 00:17:18.390
that you just saw, for analyzing
large scale recordings,

00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:21.440
for working out the
detailed wiring diagram

00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:25.173
called connectomics, and
for quantifying behavior.

00:17:25.173 --> 00:17:27.718
It turns out that we can go way beyond

00:17:27.718 --> 00:17:31.145
the simple having an animal press a button

00:17:31.145 --> 00:17:33.072
with having it move around freely,

00:17:33.072 --> 00:17:36.702
and this can be done
automatically and scored.

00:17:36.702 --> 00:17:41.670
And it's been done on flies,
it's been done on mice.

00:17:41.670 --> 00:17:44.242
They have a sequence of
stereotyped behavior.

00:17:44.242 --> 00:17:46.233
They groom themselves and so forth.

00:17:46.233 --> 00:17:47.796
And interestingly, on humans.

00:17:47.796 --> 00:17:51.431
We can now detect and automatically score

00:17:51.431 --> 00:17:53.065
your facial expressions.

00:17:53.065 --> 00:17:55.536
Like, we saw some pictures
of the fearful face.

00:17:55.536 --> 00:17:56.925
Well, we've worked with Paul Ekman,

00:17:56.925 --> 00:17:58.814
and we've developed
these deep learning tools

00:17:58.814 --> 00:18:00.992
to actually be able to
do that automatically,

00:18:00.992 --> 00:18:04.051
and we can detect these
fleeting moments of expression

00:18:04.051 --> 00:18:04.884
across your face.

00:18:04.884 --> 00:18:06.659
They're called micro-expressions,

00:18:06.659 --> 00:18:09.313
and they're very telling,
because they're brain leaks.

00:18:09.313 --> 00:18:12.075
They're feelings you're having
inside that leak through,

00:18:12.075 --> 00:18:14.288
and you may not even be
aware of 'em yourself,

00:18:14.288 --> 00:18:16.788
but they can be picked up now,

00:18:18.210 --> 00:18:20.392
and that can be a way
that we can understand

00:18:20.392 --> 00:18:24.782
a little bit more about the
internal state of your brain.

00:18:24.782 --> 00:18:28.892
Okay, so I just wanna end
by saying that Lyle Muller,

00:18:28.892 --> 00:18:30.201
who was responsible for doing

00:18:30.201 --> 00:18:33.697
that beautiful rotating traveling wave,

00:18:33.697 --> 00:18:34.586
is on the job market.

00:18:34.586 --> 00:18:37.337
So if you have a job
(audience laughs)

00:18:37.337 --> 00:18:41.569
for a budding young
experimentalist and theoretician

00:18:41.569 --> 00:18:44.023
and data analyst, he's your man.

00:18:44.023 --> 00:18:45.445
Thank you.

00:18:45.445 --> 00:18:46.278
(audience applauds)

00:18:46.278 --> 00:18:50.028
(inspirational techno music)
