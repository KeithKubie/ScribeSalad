00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:12.160
The Big Bang was probably a pretty violent
event.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.920
So how did the Universe survive?

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.869
Hey guys, Amy here with DNews.

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:23.650
Most of us probably don’t lose too much
sleep wondering how the Universe survived

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:24.650
the Big Bang.

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.610
But scientists do, because by some accounts
it shouldn’t have.

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:29.290
It comes down to the Higgs particle.

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:33.050
The Higgs is part of a larger set of theories,
called the Standard Model of Physics.

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.129
The Standard Model is a theory that explains
how the basic building blocks of matter interact.

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:41.650
In short: Our entire universe is made of 12
different matter particles — six quarks

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:46.210
made of protons and neutrons and six leptons
that include electrons and electron neutrinos

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:51.510
— and four forces: and the gravitational,
electromagnetic, strong and weak nuclear forces.

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.059
We don’t know exactly what’s responsible
for the force of gravity, but the other three

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:59.730
forces result from the exchange of force-carrier
particles called bosons; particles of matter

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.920
transfer energy bewteen them by exchanging
these bosons, and each fundamental force has

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.700
its own corresponding boson.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.010
The Higgs boson is responsible for giving
all particles mass and was discovered in 2012

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.399
with great fanfare -- you can find out more
on DiscoveryNews.com.

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:17.850
It’s the production of this Higgs particle
that’s problematic for the Big Bang Theory.

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.670
Some studies suggest that the production of
Higgs bosons during the initial accelerating

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.909
expansion immediately after the Big Bang should
have led to instability and its ultimate collapse!

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.610
Scientists have gone so far as to consider
developing a new physics to explain the origins

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:31.610
of the universe.

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.409
And the simple answer to solve the problem
might be gravity.

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.159
More specifically, the interaction between
gravity and those Higgs bosons.

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.969
Rather than speeding the collapse of the universe
just after the Big Bang, the interaction between

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:45.630
gravity and the Higgs particles, even if it
was a small one, would have been enough to

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.109
stabilize the universe against collapse!

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:50.909
And what’s more, this idea fits within the
Standard Model.

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:51.909
No new physics required!

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:52.909
Yay!

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:55.859
Of course, all that being said, there are
still scientists who are unsure that we've

00:01:55.859 --> 00:02:00.219
even FOUND the Higgs boson, and still others
who question the cause of gravity or the Big

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:01.849
Bang at ALL.

00:02:01.849 --> 00:02:04.139
Which is why we gotta keep searching for the
answers.

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:07.219
It's exciting, but it's like watching a very
slow moving sporting event.

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:09.679
Like, even slower than cricket.

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.640
What weird questions about the Big Bang keep
you guys up at night?
