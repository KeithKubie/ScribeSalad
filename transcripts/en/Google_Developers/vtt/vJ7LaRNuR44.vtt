00:00:06.487 --> 00:00:08.490
Hi, folks.

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.460
My name is Justin McKay, and
I'm a product manager at AdMob.

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:14.730
So here we are at GDC.

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.970
Games today are amazing.

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:20.470
Incredibly rich,
immersive experiences.

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:25.410
On my phone, I can build
worlds, control armies,

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.210
or do things with birds.

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.207
Make them angry, help them
cross roads, help them fly,

00:00:31.207 --> 00:00:32.790
things you'd really
think birds should

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.080
be able to do on their own.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.350
But I digress.

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.770
As games have evolved, so
have monetization options.

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:43.860
Rewarded ads have been
one of the biggest

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.890
asks from our developer
friends for a while.

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.640
But if you're not familiar,
here's a quick refresher.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.220
I'm playing a game, and I die.

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.380
I'm presented with a choice.

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:56.530
I can either wait
for 10 minutes,

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.980
or I can use my
hard earned coins,

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.490
recommend the game to a
friend, or watch a video

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:05.510
and come straight back to life.

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:10.260
When done well, rewarded ads
add value for all parties.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.700
They are opt in,
integrated experiences.

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.370
So a quick recap on mediation.

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:19.620
Mediation allows you
to maximize revenue

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:22.990
by calling multiple ad networks
from a single platform.

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:24.830
This helps ensure
there is always

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.280
an ad to show in
your application

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.720
and that that ad is
helping you maximize

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.460
the amount of money you earn.

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.280
At AdMob, we want
to build a platform

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.710
to support all your
monetization needs.

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.740
Rewarded has been a
gap, and I'm really

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.760
happy to announce that,
today, we're closing that gap.

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.710
This afternoon,
rewarded mediation

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.520
is now available in AdMob.

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.470
So these seven great
networks, we're

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.260
adding these to the
40-plus networks

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.030
that we already support
through regular mediation.

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.650
This afternoon, Ad Colony,
AppLovin, Chartboost, Upsight--

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.720
formerly Fuse-- Fyber, and
Vungle are all available,

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.100
and I'm really excited to
say Unity Ads will be coming

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.266
in the next couple of weeks.

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:14.400
We want to make experimenting
with rewarded ads easy.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.410
We want you to be
able to experiment

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.270
with different networks
and different orders

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.170
and different reward types.

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.960
As such, you can configure
reward and waterfall settings

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.160
for each ad unit.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.500
That information is
stored server side,

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.980
so you don't need to change
your code to experiment

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.860
with new configurations.

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.810
And we want to give you tools
to maximize performance.

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.780
With our ad network
optimization product,

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.660
we automate the process of
calling the ad from the highest

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.180
paying network.

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.180
And optionally, you
can set frequency caps

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.990
to make sure your users
don't get bored seeing

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:53.060
the same ad again and again.

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.240
A little bit more about
ad network optimization--

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.430
so mediation on its
own isn't quite enough.

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.070
Across multiple networks, the
CPMs are changing in real time.

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:05.340
Managing that
complexity manually

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.340
is very, very difficult.
When you enable ANO,

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.410
AdMob will automatically
check which

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:16.230
network is paying the highest ad
and return that into your app.

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.110
This helps maintain a
high level of revenue.

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.640
So I'm really pleased to say
that four of the networks

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.790
are fully supported with
country level granularity,

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.550
and three more are
coming later in April.

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:31.120
So set up is really
straightforward.

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.036
As I said, we want to
give you the flexibility

00:03:33.036 --> 00:03:34.850
to experiment with rewards.

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:36.580
When you're setting
up your rewards,

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:39.430
you can specify to use third
party settings that you've

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.810
put on another
network, or you can

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:44.540
set overrides that are
stored on the Google servers.

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.950
And you can also set
a frequency cap down

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.280
to the day, hour, or minute.

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.967
And, of course,
measurement is critical.

00:03:52.967 --> 00:03:55.483
So you'll be able to
see in your reports

00:03:55.483 --> 00:03:59.160
your rewarded queries,
starts, and completes.

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.345
So we are really, really excited
to bring this to you today.

00:04:03.345 --> 00:04:05.262
We know it's been
a gap for a while.

00:04:05.262 --> 00:04:07.095
We've been testing with
a number of partners

00:04:07.095 --> 00:04:08.752
over the last quarter,
and I'm really

00:04:08.752 --> 00:04:10.126
pleased to say
that they love it.

00:04:10.126 --> 00:04:12.506
So we really look
forward to seeing

00:04:12.506 --> 00:04:15.362
how the rewarded space
evolves, and we're really

00:04:15.362 --> 00:04:17.360
looking forward to
working more with you

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:19.249
to get us feedback
on the product,

00:04:19.249 --> 00:04:21.540
and I'm really excited to
see how it's going to evolve.

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.300
So thank you very much.

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:27.250
