00:00:00.346 --> 00:00:01.114
Hey it's me Destin,

00:00:01.114 --> 00:00:02.533
welcome back to Smarter Every Day.

00:00:02.533 --> 00:00:04.999
Most people know that if you're gonna go to the International Space Station

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:07.415
you first get on this rocket in Russia called the Soyuz.

00:00:07.415 --> 00:00:08.374
You strap yourself in,

00:00:08.374 --> 00:00:09.584
you launch from Baikonur

00:00:09.584 --> 00:00:10.872
and you go straight up to the space station,

00:00:10.872 --> 00:00:13.627
you pop open the hatch and then you high-five all your astronaut buddies, right?

00:00:13.627 --> 00:00:15.850
But there's a lot more to it if you think about it.

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:18.209
There's actually orbital mechanics and physics

00:00:18.209 --> 00:00:20.840
that are all figured out on the ground before they leave.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.782
So today on Smarter Every Day we're gonna talk about rocket science,

00:00:23.782 --> 00:00:25.490
and it's really not that hard, I promise.

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:26.879
US astronaut Scott Kelly,

00:00:26.879 --> 00:00:29.402
and Russian cosmonaut Mikhail Korniyenko

00:00:29.402 --> 00:00:30.854
are about to go to the International Space Station

00:00:30.854 --> 00:00:32.231
for an entire year.

00:00:32.231 --> 00:00:33.725
That's a really big deal.

00:00:33.725 --> 00:00:35.610
But before we talk about the orbital mechanics

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:36.603
think about this.

00:00:36.603 --> 00:00:38.279
Astronauts are just people,

00:00:38.279 --> 00:00:39.900
like me, like you.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.092
What would you be thinking about if you were strapped

00:00:42.092 --> 00:00:45.627
into that rocket, knowing you're gonna leave warm showers for an entire year.

00:00:45.627 --> 00:00:48.980
How cool would it be to actually get inside this Russian rocket

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.046
and have just a normal person to person conversation

00:00:52.046 --> 00:00:53.469
with a guy that's about to do this?

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:55.636
Even though his launch window is getting closer and closer,

00:00:55.636 --> 00:00:58.256
and his time on Earth is more and more precious at this point,

00:00:58.256 --> 00:01:01.158
Scott Kelly was gracious enough to volunteer some of his free time

00:01:01.158 --> 00:01:04.878
to just hang out with us in the Soyuz capsule and tell us what he's about to do.

00:01:04.878 --> 00:01:06.405
This is astronaut Scott Kelly.

00:01:06.405 --> 00:01:07.560
- Hi.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.954
- Scott's about to do something no American has ever done,

00:01:09.954 --> 00:01:11.119
he's about to ride one of these,

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:13.181
which is a Soyuz capsule,

00:01:13.181 --> 00:01:15.442
up to the International Space Station for how long?

00:01:15.442 --> 00:01:17.201
- I'll be there about a year.

00:01:17.201 --> 00:01:21.689
I'll launch in March of 2015, next March, this year,

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.474
and land sometime in March of the following year,

00:01:24.474 --> 00:01:26.544
so it'll be almost a year.

00:01:26.544 --> 00:01:30.508
- Alright so there's a whole regime of different science experiments

00:01:30.508 --> 00:01:31.578
that's gonna happen because of this.

00:01:31.578 --> 00:01:35.866
The main goal is to get ready for Mars, a long duration mission, right?

00:01:35.866 --> 00:01:44.197
- Yep, that's correct. You know NASA's ultimate goal is one day to put people on Mars

00:01:44.197 --> 00:01:47.367
so there's a lot we need to still learn about that.

00:01:47.367 --> 00:01:53.189
Some of it has to do with how the space environment affects the human body for long periods of time,

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.197
particularly with the growths of bone loss, muscle loss,

00:01:56.197 --> 00:01:59.588
effects of radiation on our genetics,

00:01:59.588 --> 00:02:07.311
our vision, we have problems with vision with crew members during long duration space flight.

00:02:07.311 --> 00:02:12.772
Our immune system, vestibular system, so that's kind of the human part of it,

00:02:12.772 --> 00:02:14.874
and there's also the hardware part of it.

00:02:14.874 --> 00:02:18.020
You know travelling that far away from Earth is a,

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.728
you know represents a challenge with regards to how we design our life support systems,

00:02:22.728 --> 00:02:25.516
you know how we produce oxygen, produce water,

00:02:25.516 --> 00:02:30.424
and you know those kind of things, electricity to keep us alive

00:02:30.424 --> 00:02:31.876
in space for long periods of time.

00:02:31.876 --> 00:02:33.593
- It's like camping for a year right?

00:02:33.593 --> 00:02:36.633
- Yeah, you know this flight will be camping for a year.

00:02:36.633 --> 00:02:40.868
Even though you're in space you're still 250 miles above the Earth,

00:02:40.868 --> 00:02:44.421
although you're going very fast at 17,500 miles per hour,

00:02:44.421 --> 00:02:50.278
but it still is a place that we can get resupplied fairly frequently,

00:02:50.278 --> 00:02:52.638
but when you're going to Mars you can't, so..

00:02:52.638 --> 00:02:53.978
- Are you gonna simulate any of that?

00:02:53.978 --> 00:02:58.125
Are you gonna, you know, change your underwear less frequently or anything weird like that? [laugh]

00:02:58.125 --> 00:03:01.261
- [laugh] Ahh.. I wasn't planning on it.

00:03:01.261 --> 00:03:03.515
- [laugh] These are important issues we need to know man.

00:03:03.515 --> 00:03:07.470
- Yeah, yeah.. But ah, are we simulating anything about..

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.825
We're doing a lot of science that would relate to living in space for longer periods of time.

00:03:12.825 --> 00:03:17.444
As far as particular simulation, I'm gonna, you know personally I'm gonna try to imagine,

00:03:17.444 --> 00:03:21.220
OK it's six months, you know, we might be showing up at Mars

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.360
and then I'd spend a year on the surface and it'd take me..

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.054
- Because for you, this is different for you than any other astronaut.

00:03:27.054 --> 00:03:29.410
Obviously your twin brother Mark's on the ground,

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:33.544
he's, you know, he's taking all kinds of data as you're doing that up there,

00:03:33.544 --> 00:03:37.879
but for you, I have looked at the duration of your space flights.

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:42.115
If you graph them, you're gradually getting longer and longer,

00:03:42.115 --> 00:03:44.974
so I mean if you project that graph up,

00:03:44.974 --> 00:03:49.901
that's like a space, or a Mars trip type duration.

00:03:49.901 --> 00:03:50.772
- Yeah it was interesting,

00:03:50.772 --> 00:03:53.518
I mentioned that in a public affairs event,

00:03:53.518 --> 00:03:55.171
how my first flight was 8 days,

00:03:55.171 --> 00:03:56.882
second flight 13,

00:03:56.882 --> 00:03:59.632
third flight 159.

00:03:59.632 --> 00:04:02.570
My fourth flight will be around a year.

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:08.405
And if you tried to draw a curve it's like a second order polynomial,

00:04:08.405 --> 00:04:12.890
and if I was to fly a fifth flight, you know, and flying along.

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:14.141
- That puts you on Mars, wouldn't it.

00:04:14.141 --> 00:04:18.411
- It puts me at five years, over five years in space, so easily go to Mars.

00:04:18.411 --> 00:04:19.256
- That's awesome.

00:04:19.256 --> 00:04:21.477
- Which probably means I'm not gonna fly in space again right?

00:04:21.477 --> 00:04:23.135
- No I saw where you tweeted that.

00:04:23.135 --> 00:04:24.584
When you're actually flying here,

00:04:24.584 --> 00:04:27.497
you're gonna be under intense acceleration,

00:04:27.497 --> 00:04:30.008
so how the heck do you push that button right there for example?

00:04:30.008 --> 00:04:31.799
- The guy in this seat can kind of reach,

00:04:31.799 --> 00:04:36.193
but the guy in the center seat has a stick, he can push the buttons.

00:04:36.193 --> 00:04:38.392
- So he just grabs a stick and he sticks it up there.

00:04:38.392 --> 00:04:41.624
- Yeah, it's a fancy stick but it's a stick.

00:04:41.624 --> 00:04:46.413
And I can control some of his valves over here,

00:04:46.413 --> 00:04:48.363
I can reach them better from there than he can.

00:04:48.363 --> 00:04:51.127
- So you actually control docking and things like that from here?

00:04:51.127 --> 00:04:56.140
- Yeah the Soyuz commander can.. The Soyuz docks automatically generally,

00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:00.277
but sometimes you have to downmode to a manual docking and you control it from here.

00:05:00.277 --> 00:05:01.154
- OK that was pretty awesome,

00:05:01.154 --> 00:05:04.270
however we still don't know how the Soyuz gets up to the station.

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:06.679
To figure this out let's go talk to Reid Wiseman.

00:05:06.679 --> 00:05:09.943
His expedition recently set the record for most research done

00:05:09.943 --> 00:05:11.577
in a single week on orbit.

00:05:11.577 --> 00:05:12.716
You just recently did this.

00:05:12.716 --> 00:05:13.365
- I did this.

00:05:13.365 --> 00:05:13.884
- OK

00:05:13.884 --> 00:05:14.906
- I did this May 29.

00:05:14.906 --> 00:05:15.535
- Is it awesome?

00:05:15.535 --> 00:05:16.183
- Oh it's awesome.

00:05:16.183 --> 00:05:18.476
- Alright, so what happens once you get to space?

00:05:18.476 --> 00:05:20.768
OK people know the rocket,

00:05:20.768 --> 00:05:23.690
and people know space station.

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:25.331
People have no idea what happens in between.

00:05:25.331 --> 00:05:26.713
- There is a little bit that happens in between.

00:05:26.713 --> 00:05:27.227
- OK

00:05:27.227 --> 00:05:30.234
- So the ride from ground to space, that's nine and a half minutes,

00:05:30.234 --> 00:05:31.858
and that's on a really powerful rocket,

00:05:31.858 --> 00:05:33.235
everybody's seen it, it's filled with fuel,

00:05:33.235 --> 00:05:34.796
a lot of fire, you go up,

00:05:34.796 --> 00:05:37.490
and at the end of that ride you're going about 17,000 miles an hour.

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:38.251
- OK.

00:05:38.251 --> 00:05:41.719
- OK and from there though, you have to rendezvous with the International Space Station,

00:05:41.719 --> 00:05:43.165
and that's going just a little bit faster.

00:05:43.165 --> 00:05:44.107
- And that's what I want to talk about.

00:05:44.107 --> 00:05:44.993
- Let's talk about it.

00:05:44.993 --> 00:05:49.582
- OK. I think what a lot of people think is that the rocket just gradually takes you up to the space station

00:05:49.582 --> 00:05:51.628
in this spiral orbit, and that's not what happens at all.

00:05:51.628 --> 00:05:52.271
- You know what I used to think?

00:05:52.271 --> 00:05:52.756
- What's that?

00:05:52.756 --> 00:05:54.798
- I used to think the rocket just launched straight up to the space station.

00:05:54.798 --> 00:05:56.014
- Yeah, I get it.

00:05:56.014 --> 00:05:58.646
- I never thought that it actually tracks down range.

00:05:58.646 --> 00:06:00.603
- So what is the moment where you're like,

00:06:00.603 --> 00:06:01.802
"Holy cow I'm in space,"

00:06:01.802 --> 00:06:02.803
when does that happen?

00:06:02.803 --> 00:06:05.035
- The moment, that moment is very clear.

00:06:05.035 --> 00:06:07.612
It's exactly when your third stage cuts off,

00:06:07.612 --> 00:06:09.206
so that's nine and a half minutes in,

00:06:09.206 --> 00:06:10.829
and you're no longer under powered flight,

00:06:10.829 --> 00:06:12.651
and your booster falls away,

00:06:12.651 --> 00:06:15.968
and you really, you actually feel like you're floating up

00:06:15.968 --> 00:06:17.029
because you're still strapped in your seat.

00:06:17.029 --> 00:06:18.894
They're gonna put you up at a fairly safe altitude

00:06:18.894 --> 00:06:20.209
where you're outside the atmosphere

00:06:20.209 --> 00:06:21.705
and the rocket's not gonna fall back down.

00:06:21.705 --> 00:06:22.638
It's not gonna have a lot of drag on it

00:06:22.638 --> 00:06:23.585
so it'll just stay up there.

00:06:23.585 --> 00:06:26.406
And then from there, we're gonna do a series of burns,

00:06:26.406 --> 00:06:28.565
and in the Soyuz we do seven burns.

00:06:28.565 --> 00:06:32.146
OK, but the first two are just gonna be a straight up Hohmann Transfer.

00:06:32.146 --> 00:06:33.458
- OK gotcha. Let me explain that.

00:06:33.458 --> 00:06:35.208
A Hohmann Transfer, make sure I get this right,

00:06:35.208 --> 00:06:38.091
a Hohmann Transfer is like if you're in a circular orbit,

00:06:38.091 --> 00:06:40.843
and you want to go to a larger or smaller circular orbit,

00:06:40.843 --> 00:06:43.537
you draw an ellipse between the two circles right?

00:06:43.537 --> 00:06:44.549
- That's right. You're gonna do a burn on one side,

00:06:44.549 --> 00:06:47.518
and then 45 minutes later for us, you're gonna do another burn

00:06:47.518 --> 00:06:49.095
because you're gonna be on the other side of the planet.

00:06:49.095 --> 00:06:50.320
It's a little less than 45 minutes.

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:51.468
- Gotcha, OK.

00:06:51.468 --> 00:06:52.917
- But then that'll perfectly,

00:06:52.917 --> 00:06:55.308
that'll turn one circular orbit into another circular orbit

00:06:55.308 --> 00:06:56.531
that's either a little bigger or smaller.

00:06:56.531 --> 00:06:59.701
- Got it. Two burns, Hohmann Transfer. Awesome.

00:06:59.701 --> 00:07:01.544
So then the second Maneuver... 

00:07:01.544 --> 00:07:02.835
It's actually a little trick

00:07:02.835 --> 00:07:03.605
We don't know on that booster

00:07:03.605 --> 00:07:05.356
We don't know exactly where it's going to insert us into orbit

00:07:05.356 --> 00:07:08.298
So we could be a little high, a little low,

00:07:08.298 --> 00:07:12.715
A little fast, or a little slow.

00:07:12.715 --> 00:07:15.723
-Why is that? Is it because every rocket isn't the same? - Every Rocket is a little bit differrent

00:07:15.723 --> 00:07:18.144
These next two burns are just gonna correct for our dispersion errors.

00:07:18.144 --> 00:07:20.653
And now we're pha.. what we call phasing with the space station.

00:07:20.653 --> 00:07:26.121
So we're gonna stay in this phasing orbit until the space station is kind of where it needs to be.

00:07:26.121 --> 00:07:30.879
- Oh, OK I got it. If you are closer to the Earth you're actually orbiting the Earth quicker right?

00:07:30.879 --> 00:07:31.589
- That's correct.

00:07:31.589 --> 00:07:35.177
- OK so what is it, on station it's every 90 minutes you go around the Earth?

00:07:35.177 --> 00:07:35.835
- Once every 90 minutes.

00:07:35.835 --> 00:07:38.536
So when you're a little bit lower it's once every 86 minutes,

00:07:38.536 --> 00:07:39.733
you know it's a little bit faster.

00:07:39.733 --> 00:07:41.480
- OK so that's the purpose of the phasing orbit then.

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:42.931
- Catch up with the space station.

00:07:42.931 --> 00:07:45.120
- OK, got it. So that's our timing.

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:45.812
- That's our timing.

00:07:45.812 --> 00:07:47.007
- So now we're four burns in.

00:07:47.007 --> 00:07:47.679
- OK

00:07:47.679 --> 00:07:48.544
- But now..

00:07:48.544 --> 00:07:50.250
- So we've done our Hohmann Transfer..

00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:51.711
- We've done our Hohmann Transfer to build our orbit up,

00:07:51.711 --> 00:07:54.823
we've done our next two burns to correct for any sort of dispersion on ascent..

00:07:54.823 --> 00:07:56.330
- Now we're on the perfect phasing orbit.

00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:59.369
- We're perfectly set, perfectly circular orbit if that's where we wanna be,

00:07:59.369 --> 00:08:00.788
and now we're just waiting,

00:08:00.788 --> 00:08:04.146
and when the space station is at the exact right spot we're gonna do one more

00:08:04.146 --> 00:08:05.438
Hohmann Transfer. Two burns.

00:08:05.438 --> 00:08:07.573
And it would actually send us out in front of the space station.

00:08:07.573 --> 00:08:09.233
So what we'll do is we wait,

00:08:09.233 --> 00:08:10.738
and right when we get in front of the space station

00:08:10.738 --> 00:08:12.936
we turn the rocket around and we do a third burn now,

00:08:12.936 --> 00:08:14.994
and it sets us perfectly up in front of the space station.

00:08:14.994 --> 00:08:16.190
- So you do a U-turn in space?

00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:16.972
- You do a U-turn in space.

00:08:16.972 --> 00:08:17.881
And you actually see it.

00:08:17.881 --> 00:08:18.977
You watch the Earth go all the way by,

00:08:18.977 --> 00:08:19.880
you go backwards,

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:21.172
you hit the brakes just a tiny bit,

00:08:21.172 --> 00:08:22.654
then you flip your space ship back around

00:08:22.654 --> 00:08:23.721
pointed at the space station,

00:08:23.721 --> 00:08:25.460
and now we're sitting right in front of the ISS

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:27.209
and we're just waiting and then we're gonna go

00:08:27.209 --> 00:08:30.313
real, real slow. Proximity operations and we're flying it just just like an airplane,

00:08:30.313 --> 00:08:31.412
and we go in and dock.

00:08:31.412 --> 00:08:34.281
- Sweet. OK so it's just X, Y, Z, roll, pitch, yaw at that point.

00:08:34.281 --> 00:08:34.995
- Exactly.

00:08:34.995 --> 00:08:38.665
- That's fantastic. How long does it take to actually dock to the space station?

00:08:38.665 --> 00:08:39.720
- It takes about a half an hour.

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:40.839
From the time you get to prox ops,

00:08:40.839 --> 00:08:44.297
we're gonna go really really slow and it takes about a half an hour to get that docking completed.

00:08:44.297 --> 00:08:45.138
- OK is it..

00:08:45.138 --> 00:08:49.481
- You could do it much quicker but I mean when you have two big pieces of metal that are going 17.500 miles an hour,

00:08:49.481 --> 00:08:51.314
you want to make sure they touch each other pretty gently.

00:08:51.314 --> 00:08:52.544
- Let's summarize....

00:08:52.544 --> 00:08:56.905
The launch gets you into the insertion orbit where you do a Hohmann Transfer to get up a bit higher.

00:08:56.905 --> 00:08:59.752
You do some clean up burns to get into the perfect phasing orbit

00:08:59.752 --> 00:09:01.969
where you catch up with the ISS because 

00:09:01.969 --> 00:09:03.805
you're going around the Earth faster.

00:09:03.805 --> 00:09:06.343
You chill right here until the time is right

00:09:06.343 --> 00:09:08.926
and then you do two burns which puts you out in front of the ISS.

00:09:08.926 --> 00:09:13.191
A FLIP and a BRAKING BURN then brings you in for docking and there you go.

00:09:13.191 --> 00:09:15.848
You now understand some rocket science.

00:09:15.848 --> 00:09:19.723
[music]

00:09:20.335 --> 00:09:25.395
So seriously, my goal for this video was to more than double the amount of followers on Instagram for Scott Kelly

00:09:25.395 --> 00:09:27.346
and send a bunch of people to his Twitter account.

00:09:27.346 --> 00:09:30.451
He's like a living science experiment on the International Space Station.

00:09:30.451 --> 00:09:31.711
So please go check those out,

00:09:31.711 --> 00:09:33.061
I'll leave links in the video description.

00:09:33.061 --> 00:09:34.685
I would greatly appreciate that.

00:09:34.685 --> 00:09:36.744
I'm Destin, you're getting Smarter Every Day.

00:09:36.744 --> 00:09:38.205
Have a good one.

00:09:38.933 --> 00:09:40.492
OK we're in the ISS.

00:09:40.492 --> 00:09:41.469
This is where you dock?

00:09:41.469 --> 00:09:47.506
- Yeah so this is the Russian segment and a much higher fidelity mock up in Russia

00:09:47.506 --> 00:09:50.802
but there's a module that comes out of the top of the space station here

00:09:50.802 --> 00:09:54.138
called MRM2. My Soyuz will dock to that.

00:09:54.138 --> 00:09:57.622
The other Soyuzes are docked in other parts of the Russian segment.

00:09:57.622 --> 00:09:58.940
- Thank you very much sir, I appreciate your time.

00:09:58.940 --> 00:09:59.364
- You bet.

00:09:59.364 --> 00:10:01.364
- Have a good one. Bye.
