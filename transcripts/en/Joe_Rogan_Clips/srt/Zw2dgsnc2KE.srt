00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:04,140
The Joe Rogan experience, they, you know,

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:09,060
our government and other governments
could debunk any information on Ufos,

3
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:10,530
anything because they,
you know,

4
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:14,460
there wasn't like the wide
communication that did exist now. Right.

5
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:19,970
So I think now they put in people who are
saying this crazy wild way out shit so

6
00:00:22,111 --> 00:00:26,010
that people are, that are really trying
to expose truth on certain things.

7
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:28,800
They get looked at as whack jobs.

8
00:00:28,801 --> 00:00:31,500
Like the rest of those
that are trying to say,

9
00:00:31,501 --> 00:00:35,580
oh well flat earth or we're on a disk
or we're in a globe or Blah blah blah.

10
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:39,120
You know, ever been spying on you.
They'll throw all that together. Yeah.

11
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,030
It is buying on you. Yeah. If
they are, that is for sure. I,

12
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:44,640
they really are that it's, it's, you know,

13
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:48,960
since George Bush Jr was president,
they've been listening to our phone calls.

14
00:00:48,961 --> 00:00:50,130
I mean that's a fact.
I mean,

15
00:00:50,131 --> 00:00:53,490
that was one of the things they
enacted with the homeland security,

16
00:00:53,491 --> 00:00:58,320
that they can record every
American's call and you know,

17
00:00:58,321 --> 00:01:02,310
whatever conversation mentioned certain
key words as we were saying earlier,

18
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:03,840
they would,
you know,

19
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:07,290
they would get shuffled off to a certain
department and those guys were red

20
00:01:07,291 --> 00:01:10,710
flagged and looked at and that still
happens today still to this day.

21
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:14,040
You don't need a warrant. They can just
listen. I mean, I'll tell you this, right?

22
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:18,630
There was a, I've been traveling
what, 20, 20 some odd years at,

23
00:01:18,631 --> 00:01:21,810
at the point where, um, when I,

24
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,550
when I was coming back into the
United States for a long time,

25
00:01:26,551 --> 00:01:30,420
I would not get randomly
checked or anything like that.

26
00:01:30,421 --> 00:01:32,340
They just let us go by.

27
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:37,470
And I made a few posts somewhere,
you know,

28
00:01:37,471 --> 00:01:40,500
with an abundant amount of cannabis,
right.

29
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:43,020
And right after that post,

30
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:46,110
each time I came back
into the United States,

31
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:50,850
they send me into secondary for a search.
And I started asking like, Hey, um,

32
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:54,630
I've been traveling for x
amount of years now. Every,

33
00:01:54,631 --> 00:01:59,631
I've noticed that the last four times
that I've come back from another country,

34
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,580
you guys are randomly,
you know,

35
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:06,420
checking my bags now what's
the deal and my red flag,

36
00:02:06,421 --> 00:02:10,920
what's going on with my passport?
Um, well, you know, we're,

37
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:13,230
I'm not really allowed to tell you this,
but I mean,

38
00:02:13,231 --> 00:02:17,220
have you been with kind of postings
have you made on your social networks?

39
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:20,190
Really? Yeah. And I
said, okay, say no more.

40
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:23,290
And I already knew what it was
cause I had put like, you know, uh,

41
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:27,450
a post with like four or five,
six pounds in it,

42
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,920
but it's five pounds a we'd
even look like it's a lot.

43
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:39,030
It's like giant pillows he filled with.
Yeah. So, you know, right then and there,

44
00:02:39,031 --> 00:02:43,680
I knew, you know, from that reaction that
he had that anybody with any sort of,

45
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,910
um, that's involved in entertainment,
music, athlete, you know,

46
00:02:47,911 --> 00:02:52,560
whatever actor, actress, they're
watching all of our shit.

47
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,810
Oh, for sure. They're
listening and they're watching.

48
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,350
So especially someone like you has been
at the forefront of pushing cannabis

49
00:02:59,351 --> 00:03:03,340
legalization and always talked
about it openly, flagrantly,

50
00:03:03,341 --> 00:03:07,720
even when it was a schedule one
substance. So yeah. Everywhere, you know?

51
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:08,290
Okay.
