00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.583
Does looking around
the animal kingdom

00:00:01.583 --> 00:00:03.770
make you wonder if your
penis is the same as all

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:04.660
these other animals?

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:05.660
I mean, if you have one?

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:06.493
It probably doesn't.

00:00:06.493 --> 00:00:09.560
But just in case, we've gathered
up some of the weirdest ones.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.220
Hey gang, Trace here for DNews.

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.700
Sex organs are weird looking.

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.750
But they're also crazy cool.

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.000
We gathered up the
strangest animal penises

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.970
we could think of.

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.090
Their 16-inch-long member makes
the ducks more competitive

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.590
sexually and also helps
lasso potential mates

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:32.360
who are trying to escape.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.170
Just note, this thing is
longer than the duck is tall.

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:37.070
These little guys are
really promiscuous.

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.600
And the tip is all brushy to
wipe off other duck's sperm.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.810
And the base of the super-long
corkscrew-like like penis

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:45.100
is barbed.

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.430
I'm not sure why,
but it's weird.

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.170
The barnacle, winner
for most giant.

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:52.590
It's not always
size that matters.

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.000
But if it did,
the lowly barnacle

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.640
would win the
locker room debate.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.930
Barnacles have the largest
penis of any animal-- relatively

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:00.430
speaking.

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:03.450
As a sidebar to the
giantness, the barnacle

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:04.379
is anchored in place.

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.280
So it can't exactly
go off and copulate.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.010
Instead, it releases
sperm into the water

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:13.580
and lets the current carry it to
a female to fertilize the eggs.

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:14.660
That's really strange.

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.550
To sea slug doesn't ever
need a prophylactic.

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:19.860
Instead, once it's done, it
just throws the penis away.

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.270
Yep, just falls off
there, and the dude

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:23.814
grows a knew one
to use tomorrow.

00:01:23.814 --> 00:01:26.105
And after it mates, one third
of the penis sort of just

00:01:26.105 --> 00:01:27.790
dangles and falls
off and floats away.

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:28.710
I'm not joking.

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.920
The penis slowly
regrows, but the slug

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.350
can use what's left to
copulate again and again.

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.900
It has a disposable penis.

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.817
And finally, the winner
of the penis-off-- this

00:01:38.817 --> 00:01:39.650
is the leopard slug.

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.650
And when it wants to mate, it
adds an ingredient to its mucus

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:46.630
trail that changes flavor.

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:48.160
When an interested
mate comes along,

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.310
the couple find a spot to
hang from a mucus strand,

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.500
and then push their
penises, yes, they

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.930
both have penises, out
the side of their head.

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.330
Yes, they live
behind their heads.

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.580
And they intertwine
the things and it's--

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.440
What surprises you about
the animal kingdom?

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.710
Not necessarily a
penis, but something

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:05.880
cool an animal can do.

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.000
Share it in the comments
area and let us now.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.389
Thanks for tuning in to DNews.

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:11.570
We really appreciate
you watching.

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:13.480
