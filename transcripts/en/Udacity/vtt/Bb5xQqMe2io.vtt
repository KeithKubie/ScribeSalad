00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Here we have an incline plane with a person pushing this, let's say rock,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
100 kg up the plane, trying to get it to a height of 1 m.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
We saw in the last unit that to analyze a block in an incline plane instead of writing mg

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
like normally do going straight down, we can break it into components,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
which we call perpendicular and parallel components.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
For the case of a nice smooth frictionless plane, this parallel force is balanced by the pushing force

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
of the guy who I just erased, sorry guy

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and the perpendicular force is balanced by the normal force

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
of the surface of this plane pushing up against the block.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
We show in the problem set that the perpendicular force can be expressed

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
as the weight times the cosine of this angle, which we have called α

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and the parallel force here can be expressed as this mg&lt;i&gt;sin α.&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Can you tell me for the case of a 100 kg block and angle of 30°, what would this parallel

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
force of gravity, the force tending to pull the block down the incline plane.

00:01:01.000 --> 99:59:59.000
What would that be equal to?
