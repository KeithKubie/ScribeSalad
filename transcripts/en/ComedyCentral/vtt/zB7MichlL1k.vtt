GATHER ROUND.
WELCOME, GENTLEMEN.

00:00:05.205 --> 00:00:08.709
WHAT A BEAUTIFUL AND BLESSED DAY
FOR AN AUCTION.

00:00:08.742 --> 00:00:13.714
ALL RIGHT, Y'ALL,

00:00:13.747 --> 00:00:15.415

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:16.717
- STRAIGHT UP.

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:19.086
I DON'T CARE WHAT PLANTATION
I END UP ON.

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:21.488
I'M STRAIGHT STAGING A REVOLT
IN THIS MOTHER[bleep].

00:00:21.522 --> 00:00:22.623
- HELLS YEAH.

00:00:22.656 --> 00:00:26.527

LOT B, AND LOT C.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.795
- UH, $3 ON LOT A.

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:30.197
- 5!

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.534
- $5 GOING ONCE, TWICE,
THREE TIMES, SOLD.

00:00:33.567 --> 00:00:38.772
LOT A GOES TO THE MAN
IN THE BLACK HAT.

00:00:40.274 --> 00:00:42.075
- I MEAN, GOOD.
- YEAH.

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:44.244
- [chuckles] I'M GLAD
I DIDN'T GET SOLD,

00:00:44.278 --> 00:00:46.780
'CAUSE I DON'T WANT TO BE OWNED
BY ANOTHER HUMAN BEING.

00:00:46.813 --> 00:00:49.216
- WHOEVER BUYS ME, THEY BETTER
KILL ME THE FIRST DAY,

00:00:49.249 --> 00:00:51.585
OR I'MA GO BUCK-WILD
ON THE WHOLE OPERATION.

00:00:51.618 --> 00:00:53.086
- OKAAY?

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.788
- NEXT ONE,

00:00:54.821 --> 00:00:57.791

00:01:05.332 --> 00:01:07.601
- $9 GOING ONCE, TWICE,

00:01:07.634 --> 00:01:09.169
both: [exhale]

00:01:09.203 --> 00:01:11.138
- OKAY, WELL,
YOU HAVE TO BUY THAT DUDE.

00:01:11.171 --> 00:01:12.372
- IT'S A NO-BRAINER.
- I MEAN, THAT GUY'S HUGE.

00:01:12.406 --> 00:01:13.674
- A MASSIVE INDIVIDUAL.

00:01:13.707 --> 00:01:15.609
- THAT'S TWO OF ME.
- ANYBODY WOULD BUY HIM.

00:01:15.642 --> 00:01:17.077
- I'D BUY THAT DUDE.

00:01:17.077 --> 00:01:19.213
- MY QUESTION IS
HOW'D THEY CATCH HIM?

00:01:19.246 --> 00:01:22.082
- NEXT!

00:01:22.082 --> 00:01:24.318
- OKAY. OH, YEAH.

- $2 ON LOT A.

00:01:26.086 --> 00:01:28.555
- $2 GOING ONCE, TWICE,
THREE TIMES, SOLD.

00:01:28.589 --> 00:01:30.090
- SEE, NOW,
THAT SURPRISES ME.

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.359
- THAT IS INTERESTING,
TO SAY THE LEAST.

00:01:32.392 --> 00:01:34.294
- I MEAN, WELL, IT JUST SEEMS
LIKE AT A CERTAIN POINT,

00:01:34.328 --> 00:01:36.930
IT'S LIKE, DO THEY EVEN KNOW
WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR?

00:01:36.964 --> 00:01:38.165
- IT'S LIKE
THE WHOLE CRITERIA

00:01:38.198 --> 00:01:39.566
SEEMS JUST A LITTLE
INCONSISTENT.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.335
- I MEAN, AT SOME POINT,
I WANT TO BE ON LOT A.

00:01:41.368 --> 00:01:44.137
- YEAH, WHICH--
CAN A BROTHA GET ON LOT A?

00:01:44.171 --> 00:01:47.407
- NEXT.

00:01:47.441 --> 00:01:48.942
- OH, HERE WE GO.
- HERE WE GO.

00:01:48.976 --> 00:01:49.977
- BEEN A PLEASURE.
- GIVE 'EM HELL.

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:51.111
- ALL RIGHT.
- OKAY.

00:01:51.111 --> 00:01:52.479
- $8 ON LOT A.

00:01:52.513 --> 00:01:54.014
- GOING ONCE, TWICE,
THREE TIMES, SOLD!

00:01:54.114 --> 00:01:55.115
- HOW DOES THAT HAPPEN?
- NOPE, NOT TRUE.

00:01:55.115 --> 00:01:56.483
- HOW DOES IT HAPPEN?

00:01:56.517 --> 00:01:58.385
- WHAT YOU JUST SAID--
THAT'S GOBBLEDYGOOK.

00:01:58.418 --> 00:01:59.586
OKAY? THAT CAN'T BE TRUE.
'CAUSE WHAT CAN THIS DUDE DO?

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:01.355
LOOK AT HIM.
WHAT COULD HE PICK?

00:02:01.388 --> 00:02:03.056
A COTTON PLANT
IS, LIKE, THIS TALL.

00:02:03.056 --> 00:02:04.224
- YES.
- I'M SAY--

00:02:04.258 --> 00:02:05.359
NO OFFENSE, BROTHA,
I'M JUST SAYING.

00:02:05.392 --> 00:02:07.528
- OFFENSE TAKEN.
- WHA--[gasps]

00:02:07.561 --> 00:02:10.197
AM I WRONG? IS HE NOT SHORT?
HE'S SHORT.

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:14.334
BUT YOU ARE ACTUALLY SHORT
IN REAL LIFE, IN THE WORLD.

00:02:14.368 --> 00:02:16.170
- YOU'RE GOOD, MAN.
- ENOUGH.

00:02:16.203 --> 00:02:18.672
I WILL NOT HAVE
MY REPUTATION TAINTED,

00:02:18.705 --> 00:02:22.075
SELLIN' SUPERFICIAL,
BIGOTED SLAVES.

00:02:22.075 --> 00:02:25.078
- SUPERFICIAL? DID THAT REALLY
JUST COME OUT OF YOUR MOUTH?

00:02:25.078 --> 00:02:27.181
- THAT'S IT!
THIS AUCTION'S OVER!

00:02:27.214 --> 00:02:28.982
- AUCTION'S OVER?
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

00:02:29.082 --> 00:02:31.318
NO, IT'S--IT AIN'T OVER.
IT'S NOT OVER!

00:02:31.351 --> 00:02:32.719
I'M STRONG, Y'ALL!

00:02:32.753 --> 00:02:34.621
I'M VERY STR--
I CAN SLEEP IN A BUCKET.

00:02:34.655 --> 00:02:37.658
- I'M FAST, I GOT STAMINA,
AND I KNOW MAGIC.

00:02:37.691 --> 00:02:40.093
- MY WORST QUALITY
IS THAT I'M A PERFECTIONIST.

00:02:40.093 --> 00:02:42.129
- LET ME MEN--
HAVE I MENTIONED THIS? DOCILE.

00:02:42.162 --> 00:02:44.531
I AM AGREEABLE
TO A FAULT.

00:02:44.565 --> 00:02:46.767
YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN THE DUDE
WHO ASKED ME TO GET ON THE BOAT

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.101
WHEN WE CAME OVER HERE.

00:02:48.101 --> 00:02:49.469
- NOT A VIOLENT BONE
IN MY BODY.

00:02:49.503 --> 00:02:51.104
- I JUST WALKED RIGHT ON,
NO BIG DEAL.

00:02:51.104 --> 00:02:52.506
NEVER SEEN A BOAT
IN MY LIFE.
