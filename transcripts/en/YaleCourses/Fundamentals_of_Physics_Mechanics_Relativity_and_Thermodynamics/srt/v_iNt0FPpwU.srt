1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,230
Okay, so what, uh, what
problem are we trying to solve?

2
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:08,250
You're trying to solve
the problem of masses,

3
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:11,690
couple of the springs and uh,

4
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:14,250
acted upon by

5
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:18,960
various forces on the
equation that we need

6
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:22,363
is the following.

7
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:36,850
So this is the most general
problem.

8
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:42,010
We looked at this as f sub zero. I
may have this, call it f last name.

9
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:45,400
Doesn't matter. It's a
matter of this symbols. Okay.

10
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:51,730
All right.
Let us first divide everything by him.

11
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:54,340
You write everything by m,

12
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:59,740
then it becomes x double.plus Gamma X.
Dot.

13
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:02,140
Let's Omega zero squared.

14
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:07,170
X Equals F zero over M Cosine Omega T.

15
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:15,240
I'm using the fact that the Omega not
was defined as the root of k over that.

16
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:21,070
We used to call it Omega,
but now I'm calling it Omega not,

17
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:25,450
and you should understand why I'm doing
that because there are now two Omegas in

18
00:01:25,451 --> 00:01:30,070
the problem that is the Omega of the
driving force. So you should imagine,

19
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:33,880
and also the 34th grabbing this
mass and moving it back and forth.

20
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:38,520
We'll make an art. It's the
natural frequency of the
math. If you pull the spring,

21
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:38,981
let it go.

22
00:01:38,981 --> 00:01:43,600
That's the frequency which it will
vibrate that I really natural frequency.

23
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:47,290
But this fixed by K and M and
o may guys for you to decide,

24
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:50,950
you can decide to apply to it.
Any force you like have any frequency.

25
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:55,570
So first take the easy case in
which the right hand side is zero,

26
00:01:57,370 --> 00:01:58,480
no driving force.

27
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
So I'm saying let's consider a simple
case f zero or f f the applied force

28
00:02:08,111 --> 00:02:08,944
vanishes.

29
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:13,570
That's the problem I spent considerable
amount of time on yesterday.

30
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,830
You can say, well, if there's no
driving force, why does anything move?

31
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:21,460
That's actually correct. If
you look a mass in the spring
and it didn't, anything,

32
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:24,410
didn't do anything to it,
the solution to this equation,

33
00:02:24,411 --> 00:02:26,950
this x equal to zero and that just fine,

34
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:32,710
but it also has interesting nontrivial
solutions because you can pull the mass

35
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,580
and then let it go after to let it go.

36
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:40,990
That are no forces on the system except
the force of friction and the force of

37
00:02:40,991 --> 00:02:45,430
the spring and that has this problem.
How do you solve this problem?

38
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:49,000
I told you, the way you solve
this problem is you make a guess.

39
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:54,410
X of t is some number a times either the
Alpha t see if it'll work and you find

40
00:02:58,061 --> 00:02:59,650
a little work and you
can this in your head.

41
00:02:59,651 --> 00:03:01,300
I certainly don't want
to repeat all of that.

42
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,750
The reason it's going to work is that
every time you take a of to Webex,

43
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:08,470
you bring down an Alpha and
still keep eating the Alpha t.

44
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:10,780
So when he put that
gets into this equation,

45
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:13,330
you're going to get
alpha square plus gamma,

46
00:03:13,331 --> 00:03:16,780
Alpha Omega Not Square famous,

47
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:19,900
a either the Alpha t equal to zero

48
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:25,330
and if this is going to vanish,

49
00:03:25,331 --> 00:03:28,630
it's not big as the bay and it's not
because if you're the Alpha t is bigger,

50
00:03:28,631 --> 00:03:31,240
this guy in brackets is going to vanish.

51
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:37,180
So that's zero. You all recognize
this to be a quadratic equation.

52
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:42,240
You go back to your days in the sandbox
when you all knew what the answer to

53
00:03:42,341 --> 00:03:42,761
this is.

54
00:03:42,761 --> 00:03:47,761
The answer to this is minus gamma over
to less than a minus GAM over to square

55
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:56,470
minus Omega, Not Square.
These are the roots.

56
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:00,700
Now here you have to look at. So
any of it, what does this mean?

57
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:02,560
This means that yes,

58
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:07,270
you can find a solution to this equation
that looks like a the Alpha tea.

59
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:13,450
It can be any number you like,
no restrictions placed on a,

60
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,580
but Alpha cannot be any number you like.

61
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:18,880
Alpha has to be the solution
to this quadratic equation.

62
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:23,260
And there are two solutions, so you can
call them Alpha plus an Alpha minus.

63
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:28,270
That's been, I branched off into
two different cases. Case one.

64
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:32,170
You can see, look, when you do the
quadratic equation, do you know the,

65
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:37,090
the way it's going to fall out is
depending on whether the stuff inside the

66
00:04:37,091 --> 00:04:41,590
bracket is positive or negative.
So let's take the easier case.

67
00:04:41,591 --> 00:04:45,680
When it's positive, that means gamble.
We're two is bigger than Omega,

68
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:49,450
not gamma. You remember
this, the force of friction.

69
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:53,200
So we wanted to be not only not zero,

70
00:04:53,201 --> 00:04:57,880
but bigger than this amount controlled
by the natural frequency. In that case,

71
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:01,820
let's not go into details,
but you can all see, uh,

72
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,820
you put whatever value you have for gamma.

73
00:05:03,821 --> 00:05:05,440
The square root of this is some number.

74
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,430
The whole thing is going to
be two real choices you get.

75
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,980
One will be minus gamma over two plus
whatever it is inside the square root,

76
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:18,790
other we minus gamma over two
minus what you have in this way.

77
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:24,550
The only thing I want you to notice is
that both these routes are negative.

78
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:30,340
This guy's obviously negative because
there's a minus GAM or two minus something

79
00:05:30,341 --> 00:05:31,660
else.
That's definitely a negative.

80
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,180
You may be a little worried here that
this is mine as GAM while we're doing this

81
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:36,063
plus something,

82
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:42,730
but the plus something is smaller than
the minus something because what's inside

83
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:47,780
the square root is gamma over to square.
If it did this quadrant of that,

84
00:05:47,781 --> 00:05:51,470
you will get exactly gam over to what
you're taking away from it. This number,

85
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:55,250
therefore, this square root is
bigger, smarter than this number.

86
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:57,770
So the overall thing
will still on negative.

87
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,270
So why am I so eager that
it should come off negative?

88
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:05,780
Why am eager to the
rules should be negative?

89
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:08,023
Yes.

90
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:16,450
Uh, no. Even if I had
positive [inaudible] workout.

91
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:19,320
Yes,
out

92
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,310
greater than one.
Then

93
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:30,380
one converse to what?
This is not a course sign function.

94
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:35,920
This is never going to be a cost sine
functions related to either the eye omega

95
00:06:36,561 --> 00:06:39,290
t or eat the [inaudible]. These
are all real exponential. Yes,

96
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:41,323
yes.

97
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:47,320
Yeah. That's some of the main problem
when you write an exponential function,

98
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:51,280
usually people write exponential.
It's like this for population growth.

99
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:54,370
Everyone says our problem is
that increasing exponentially.

100
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:57,460
They always think of exponential
as rising. Of course,

101
00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:01,810
it's also possible that if alphabet and
negative number, you could write it as a

102
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,180
play mc absolute value of Alpha just to
show you it's a falling explanations and

103
00:07:07,181 --> 00:07:10,420
we have a stomach only for falling
exponentials. You got to think,

104
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,640
if I pull this mass and then let it go,

105
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:18,100
I expect x to go down from whatever value
I had not to keep growing indefinitely.

106
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,060
That doesn't make any physical sense and
one of the great things about the Union

107
00:07:22,061 --> 00:07:26,110
of mathematics and physics is the
equation automatically works out that way.

108
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:30,070
It gives you an answer.
That makes sense. Okay.

109
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:35,100
So what you get then is a solution that
looks like this one number eight times

110
00:07:36,521 --> 00:07:40,720
either the one of the routes,
uh,

111
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:43,360
plus another number B times either.

112
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,720
The other route I wrote them,
they are both here,

113
00:07:46,721 --> 00:07:49,630
the Alpha t but I write it
is minus the absolute value.

114
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:52,580
So you can all see that
falling exponentials.

115
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:55,930
You understand if a number is negative,
like negative five,

116
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:00,790
that can be written as the minus one
times the absolute value of the number.

117
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:05,650
So it is either the Alpha t but I want
to write it in this form so it's falling.

118
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,260
So this is a case where if you
pull the mass and you let it go,

119
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:16,270
it will just relax eventually
coming to x equals zero,

120
00:08:16,271 --> 00:08:19,420
which is his normal location,
equilibrium location.

121
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,980
Now how about the numbers a and B?
Right now they are completely arbitrary.

122
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,330
And another thing you guys should
know by now is how we find a and B.

123
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,600
In order to find a and B,

124
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:35,140
we need to be given more information
other than simply the mass in the spring.

125
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:38,530
Constant, they are all sitting
here and the friction coefficient,

126
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:42,730
but that's not enough to tell you what
it does on a given day. It wants to know,

127
00:08:42,731 --> 00:08:45,190
well,
yes it's the masters that spring,

128
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:48,460
but did you pull it or they do
release it in this way or that way.

129
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:52,600
That's what the control, the answer
their call, the initial conditions,

130
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:57,450
one initial condition is what the
value of x at time t equals zero.

131
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,420
That's asking you how much
you put it when you let it go.

132
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:04,530
The other initial condition
is what does the velocity,

133
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:06,770
namely the but the Webex at times you

134
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:12,000
most of the time what you will find as
you pull the mass in the release it then

135
00:09:12,001 --> 00:09:14,130
it's got a non zero x
that a zero velocity,

136
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:18,370
but it doesn't have to be that way
because I could have pulled it and release

137
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:18,790
the teak.

138
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:22,710
Will the zero starting to move in words
and that's when you would jump in and

139
00:09:22,711 --> 00:09:27,380
you set your clocks to zero but at that
instant excess of value and the velocity

140
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:28,670
also has a nonsuit about,

141
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:33,060
they don't all have to be zero but there
are some two numbers you can pick at

142
00:09:33,061 --> 00:09:33,894
will.

143
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:39,200
You can see that if I put t equals zero
I'm going to get a zero which is one I'm

144
00:09:40,801 --> 00:09:45,780
going to get a plus. B is x zero.
That's one condition on a and B.

145
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:48,450
Now we'll take a deliberative,
namely find the velocity,

146
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:52,920
then put t equal to zero and set that
equal to some pre assigned number.

147
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:56,100
You've got a second equation for amb
and we all know we can solve those two

148
00:09:56,101 --> 00:09:58,320
equations to find a and B.

149
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:03,650
That's how you fit these three parameters
to the solution tailored made for that

150
00:10:03,781 --> 00:10:05,160
particular situation.

151
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:08,950
You should also ask another question.

152
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:13,900
Why is it that I can pick
these numbers x not and be not,

153
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:19,030
but why not keep going? Maybe the
acceleration at time zero is some number.

154
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:21,640
Why is that not up to me to decide?

155
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:27,100
Can anyone tell me why
that's not negotiable?

156
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:29,490
Yes.
Okay.

157
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:39,090
Depends upon what can I pick the
acceleration of a body at will?

158
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,753
Yes.

159
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:46,773
That tells you,

160
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:52,080
yeah, I, I'm not sure they heard the
exact answer, but it sounds close.

161
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:53,700
Close enough to what I had in mind,

162
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:57,630
which is Newton will tell you what
the acceleration of our bodies,

163
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:02,070
namely mass times acceleration
is the force and the force.

164
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:04,080
Once it's given in any given problem,

165
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:09,060
which is given by where the body is and
what the velocity is. In this example,

166
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:11,550
you have no choice in
what the accelerations,

167
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,390
but initial position and velocity
are not given by Newton's law.

168
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,530
Newton's law says if the forest is so
and so, the acceleration is so and so,

169
00:11:19,531 --> 00:11:22,050
but he doesn't tell you what should
be the velocity at a given time.

170
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:25,290
What would be the position at a
given time? That's why they are two,

171
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:28,440
three numbers.
That's why you have the answer with two,

172
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:33,500
three numbers that you can pick to bring
it in a card with these two numbers.

173
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:38,910
Okay. This solution to the
equation with x equals zero.

174
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:42,600
From now on,
I'm going to call x sub C,

175
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:45,720
but c stands for the
complimentary function.

176
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,450
Okay?

177
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:53,790
Now that is another thing that
could've happened here. Uh,

178
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:58,630
which is in fact another alternative. Let
me, you can think about what I'm saying.

179
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:02,710
The other alternative is when this gamma
over two is smarter than this Omega not.

180
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,190
Then of course you have the
square root of a negative number.

181
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:11,050
So then you go back to the stage where
they're finding the root and they say

182
00:12:11,051 --> 00:12:16,051
alpha equals minus gamma or were two plus
and minus square root of GAM over two

183
00:12:16,751 --> 00:12:19,420
squared minus omega, not square,
but that number is negative.

184
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:24,190
So that can be written as a negative
sign times the square root of this number

185
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,430
and the square root of minus one
will come over to us an I in front.

186
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:36,670
So either you will get to real roots.
This is a mathematical result.

187
00:12:36,671 --> 00:12:39,910
Nothing to do with physics, a quadratic
equation with real coefficients.

188
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:44,920
Either we'll have two real roots or it
will have two routes which are complex

189
00:12:44,921 --> 00:12:48,910
conjugates of each other. You'll learn
the notion of complex conjugation,

190
00:12:48,911 --> 00:12:50,590
which is the item in the PSI.

191
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:55,480
You can see the Alpha plus Alpha minus
have the same reel part minus gamma or to

192
00:12:55,750 --> 00:13:00,580
an opposite imaginary parts,
so in this example,

193
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:05,740
Alpha plus, it's the complex conjugate
of Alpha minus and I've totally,

194
00:13:05,741 --> 00:13:07,740
this relationship works both ways.
Therefore,

195
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:10,270
Alpha minus is a complex con
to get them out for plus.

196
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:12,950
Yeah,

197
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:14,780
so what's the solution going to look like?

198
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:20,200
It's going to look like a e to the
minus gamma t over to either the eye

199
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:29,120
or make up prime t, but I'm going to call
this fellow in brackets as Omega prime.

200
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:31,923
Yeah.

201
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:35,870
Then there's the second solution.
The real part is exactly the same.

202
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:39,920
Imaginary part is opposite
minus I omega prime t

203
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:49,920
we'll make a prime is a new frequency
connected to the natural frequency and the

204
00:13:50,531 --> 00:13:53,260
frictional force.
That's where we got three Omegas.

205
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,400
You've got to keep that in mind.

206
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:59,350
We'll make a nod is a natural frequency
vibration. If I have a driving force,

207
00:13:59,351 --> 00:14:02,230
I reserved the symbol Omega for
the frequency of the driving force.

208
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:05,680
Here is yet another quantity
with units of frequency,

209
00:14:05,681 --> 00:14:09,670
which I'm calling Omega Prime.
So what does this guy look like?

210
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:12,670
The first of all is full of complex
numbers and we don't like it.

211
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:16,360
We know the oscillator should have
a real coordinate. So you ask,

212
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:20,320
I have not picked a and B yet.
How shall I pick them? So x's real

213
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:25,390
well, forget a and B for a minute and
look at this number and this number.

214
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:29,530
Do you guys realize that they're
complex conjugates of each other?

215
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:34,330
Because I had gone to minus sign.
So for example,

216
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:36,070
if a and be able to equal numbers,

217
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:39,190
this would be a real number because
a number of pluses conjugate,

218
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:42,520
you kill the imaginary part because
they have opposite imaginative parts.

219
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:46,060
So A and B reel is a good answer,
but it's too restrictive.

220
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:51,780
All we will demand instead of a looks
like absolutely family of times either the

221
00:14:52,011 --> 00:14:56,870
IFI B should look like absolute value
of a plan, either the minus sized pie,

222
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:59,180
in other words be should be
the complex gone to get an a.

223
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:03,530
That means the same absolute value,
but opposite phase.

224
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:08,180
I didn't mind doing the complex plane.
If a numberZ is sitting there,

225
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:12,410
the complex spine together, sitting
here, they have opposite angles. Fine.

226
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:14,460
Yeah,

227
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:15,360
so if you do that,

228
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:21,080
then you get a absolute value either to
the miners gam over two times e to the I

229
00:15:22,801 --> 00:15:27,801
Omega prime t plus five
plus e to the minus.

230
00:15:28,891 --> 00:15:31,710
I may get prime t plus Fi.

231
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,340
Now we have made it real.
Yeah, and be bought.

232
00:15:38,341 --> 00:15:42,820
Being fully real means this five year
zero but you see fight doesn't really have

233
00:15:42,821 --> 00:15:44,530
to be zero.
That is too much of a distraction.

234
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:48,220
Fight can be whatever you like
provided the fight that he has,

235
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:51,040
the phase that it has same
as the phase that B has.

236
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:55,210
That means the angle in the complex plane
of the number eight the number be have

237
00:15:55,211 --> 00:15:58,570
to be opposite of each other.
This,

238
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:04,330
you guys should know what it is. I've
told you many times this is unforgivable.

239
00:16:04,331 --> 00:16:05,470
If you don't know what this is,

240
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:10,570
you're the ITA replicated the minus
I data over to his core science data.

241
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:13,810
Since you don't have the over to,
you can read it as to a

242
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:19,510
either minus GAM over to call
sign of whatever is in here,

243
00:16:19,511 --> 00:16:21,790
Omega prime t plus Fi.

244
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:29,500
At this point I'm going to change and
rotation a little bit in view of what's to

245
00:16:29,501 --> 00:16:32,800
come. Instead of calling this
Fi, I'm going to call it fi zero,

246
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:37,960
right? Because another fire is going to
come in and I want to separate those two.

247
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,680
So two times a is a new number.

248
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:46,260
I'm going to call that C and this is
the bottom line answer looks like either

249
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:51,270
minus gamma t over two host sine
Omega prime t plus five zero s

250
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:01,180
so we had, we had done all this
yesterday. I've given you the notes,

251
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:05,890
but I want you to understand
where we are going with all of this.

252
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:07,570
If you pull a mass and let it go,

253
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:11,020
it turns out that are two
things that can happen.

254
00:17:11,021 --> 00:17:13,900
I really wish I had time to bring you
these different masses and show you.

255
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,770
If you have no friction,
everyone knows what's going to happen.

256
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:21,880
You pull the out and let it go. It
oscillates forever. In real life,

257
00:17:21,881 --> 00:17:24,520
there is always some friction,
so let's turn a little friction.

258
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:27,120
What'll happen is what's very familiar,
unexpected.

259
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:32,020
It started with an aptitude of five.
Go to Ford to go to three, go to rock,

260
00:17:32,021 --> 00:17:35,710
back and forth and slowly. It may be
around, but you won't be able to see it.

261
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:37,660
That's called a damped oscillation.

262
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:42,760
That's really what's described
by this solution here.

263
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:44,500
It looks like a course sign of something,

264
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:48,790
but the number in front of it itself is
falling with time and the picture for

265
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:50,130
that look like the following.

266
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:54,100
If you just draw an
exponentially falling function,

267
00:17:54,101 --> 00:17:57,930
that's your amplitude and you multiply
that by an oscillating course, sign it.

268
00:17:57,931 --> 00:18:01,380
We'll do this. This is
it. Damped Oscillation,

269
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:05,460
but another extreme case,
which you may not think about this,

270
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:09,510
if you crank up the friction more, they'll
gamma over two is bigger than Omega,

271
00:18:09,511 --> 00:18:13,140
not. Then what happens is if
you pull the mass and let it go,

272
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:15,570
it doesn't even go to the
other side of x equal to zero.

273
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:19,500
It just slowly gets you to zero
in infinite amount of time.

274
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,440
You understand that if you pull
it from here, you let it go.

275
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:25,710
No friction is this for eternity.

276
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,630
Smaller monitor friction is slowly damped,
oscillation,

277
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:36,120
too much of friction.
You come back slowly and you come to rest.

278
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:37,351
These are,

279
00:18:37,351 --> 00:18:40,260
there are different cases and the
mathematics tells you the different cases.

280
00:18:40,261 --> 00:18:43,860
So that's what we like about the
Union of mathematics and physics.

281
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:45,930
Once you wrote down the
Basic Law of Newton,

282
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:49,560
you have no choice as to where
it takes you go where it takes.

283
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:53,550
These are the different types of
options. Okay, so this was uh,

284
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:55,260
what I did earlier on in the day,

285
00:18:55,261 --> 00:18:59,510
but now let's go back to the more
general problem I had with this uh,

286
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:01,110
right hand side,
which is not zero.

287
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:06,320
So let's write the right hand side
is an not zero x double.plus Gamma X.

288
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:10,290
Dot. Omega notch squared, x equalsF ,

289
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:13,170
naught over and m costs Omega t.

290
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:18,990
This is called the driven oscillator
oscillators, the present all the time.

291
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:23,910
For example, if you have a swing
swing goes back and forth, you may,

292
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:27,060
you may choose to push the swing back
and forth. If you've got a kid in a park,

293
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:30,360
you're applying a force,
which is an oscillating force.

294
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:34,770
Whereas in the absence of external forces,

295
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:38,280
all oscillations will eventually die down.
You guys understand that?

296
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:43,530
Why? Why do all our solutions die down
in the absence of external forces?

297
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:54,420
Yes. Yeah. Well, in this case,

298
00:19:54,421 --> 00:19:55,710
it's not addresses but friction.

299
00:19:55,711 --> 00:19:58,530
But what friction does is that
in the presence of friction,

300
00:19:58,531 --> 00:20:00,390
you cannot prove a law of
conservation of energy.

301
00:20:00,391 --> 00:20:05,130
We saw that whenever friction acts, the
energy total mechanical energy goes down.

302
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,950
So candidate plus potential
will decrease with time.

303
00:20:07,951 --> 00:20:11,610
So the installations get down.
But if you are pushing it from outside,

304
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:15,120
you can provide a constant source of
energy so we can maintain a steady

305
00:20:15,121 --> 00:20:20,010
oscillation. And that's the problem
we're looking at. That is this problem.

306
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:24,660
So how did we solve this problem?
But I said,

307
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:28,350
I don't want to solve this equation. I'm
going to manufacture it. Another problem.

308
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:32,250
Z double.plus Gamma Times Z.
Dot.

309
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:36,870
Let's Omega Not Square.
Z is f naught over em.

310
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,700
Eat with the Iomega.

311
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:47,470
So let's be very clear. This is the real
physics problem that occurs the time.

312
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:53,200
This is clearly not of
Auburn world because in our
world you don't have a force

313
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:56,350
either. The iomega t all forces
in the real world or real,

314
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:00,880
so this is a complex force. If
you break down the Edi, Omega,

315
00:21:00,881 --> 00:21:04,270
t you all know it's cost to make a tea,
which I like.

316
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:06,490
Lists I assign Omega t with.
They don't like.

317
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:11,110
I'm solving a problem in which on
top of the force I'm really applying.

318
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,170
That's the imaginary
force put on top of it.

319
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:20,800
So what does the strategy where we've
taken the problem and making it worse than

320
00:21:20,801 --> 00:21:23,800
it is? Because we have a strategy.
The strategy is the following.

321
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,090
If you have a right hand side costs,
I may get d,

322
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:31,090
Ask yourself what you're trying to do.
You're looking for some function.

323
00:21:31,091 --> 00:21:33,700
X of t we should obey this equation.

324
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:39,190
You can try various function,
maybe excess of cost, sign of time.

325
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:42,220
If it's of course not enough time to
deliver. This will be a coastline,

326
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:45,840
no date of it. It will be
assigned. One did have a doable,

327
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:47,670
I'm gonna study nor delivered.

328
00:21:47,671 --> 00:21:51,020
It will be a course in one day it will
be assigned so you cannot make it into

329
00:21:51,021 --> 00:21:55,780
your cost side. If it took a sign, the
middle guy will look like of course sign.

330
00:21:55,781 --> 00:21:58,780
You can try to balance that against this.
The end two terms look like coastline.

331
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:01,930
So neither a sign,
not a coastline works I turned,

332
00:22:01,931 --> 00:22:03,430
so something in between we'll work,

333
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:06,460
but something that always
works is the following.

334
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,300
If the right hand side
instead of being constant,

335
00:22:08,301 --> 00:22:12,490
mega t was either the Iomega t you
can guess the answer immediately,

336
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:17,800
namely z itself will behave like the
Iomega tea because then if I take two

337
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:21,080
diverters, that's going to look
like either the Iomega tee time.

338
00:22:21,081 --> 00:22:24,850
Some numbers that's going to look like a
[inaudible] mega t that's going to look

339
00:22:24,851 --> 00:22:25,930
like Edi,
Omega t.

340
00:22:25,931 --> 00:22:29,590
So the beauty of the exponential that
when you take directives you keep getting

341
00:22:29,591 --> 00:22:30,424
the exponential

342
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,473
okay.

343
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:38,130
But now the problem is
this is not the problem.

344
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:42,540
No one told you to solve this problem,
but our strategy is the following.

345
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:46,390
The right hand side has got a
real force and imaginary force,

346
00:22:46,391 --> 00:22:49,800
the real force and produce the ex
that I won the imaginary force,

347
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:53,760
purely imaginary items, send a mega t
will produce a purely imaginary answer.

348
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:58,740
So at the end of the day, I will find
the answer and keep only the real part.

349
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:02,250
That's the plan.
That's going to be the strategy.

350
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:05,050
So that this z a d,

351
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:09,330
this the is going to be the ex that I
want and we'll have a part hanging around.

352
00:23:09,331 --> 00:23:10,350
Why that I don't want,

353
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:14,910
but why is being driven by the sine
Omega t and x is being driven by the

354
00:23:14,911 --> 00:23:19,020
constant Manga te but now
let's solve it by inspection.

355
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:23,680
So let's make a guess that z
looks like some numbers. Z,

356
00:23:23,681 --> 00:23:28,430
not even the Iomega t
no,

357
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:32,190
it's very easy to take delivered of
exponential gets pulled down Iomega every

358
00:23:32,191 --> 00:23:36,810
time you see a date of it too.
So z double dot will become Iomega Square,

359
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:40,860
which is minus Omega squared.
Z.

360
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:42,240
Dot will become Iomega.

361
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:46,430
There's a gamma there and Omega and
square is multiplying by a number.

362
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:51,920
So this is what I get on the left hand
side and I wanted to equal this on the

363
00:23:51,921 --> 00:23:52,754
right hand side.

364
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:59,980
And you're almost there because the time
dependence of the two sites that are

365
00:23:59,981 --> 00:24:03,770
identical so you can cancel it.
And what you find is yes,

366
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,920
I can satisfy the equation that's
given to me throw wide the numberZ ,

367
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:10,910
not the numbers in front of
it, or B, is this condition.

368
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:12,323
Okay,

369
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:17,200
that's trivially solved because we
all know how to get the solution.

370
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:21,480
That one zene art is opened by dividing
both sides by everything that multiplies

371
00:24:21,481 --> 00:24:22,314
the knot,

372
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:27,340
which happens to be well make gun r
squared minus Omega Square less Iomega

373
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:28,593
gamble.

374
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:38,623
So the

375
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:40,100
beautiful property,

376
00:24:40,101 --> 00:24:44,480
the exponential function is that you
take what is a differential equation,

377
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:47,210
turn it into an Algebraic equation,

378
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:49,523
okay?

379
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:53,310
Because the act of taking derivatives
generally is a nasty operations.

380
00:24:53,311 --> 00:24:57,360
Science become coastlines. Excused become
three x square, but exponential domains,

381
00:24:57,361 --> 00:24:59,850
the exponential, that's the
property you'd find next blind here.

382
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:04,520
So now we got z not to be this one

383
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:09,540
and z itself.
The function.

384
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:14,930
The complex function looking for is f
not over m e to the I Omega t divided by

385
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:19,560
this quantity downstairs.

386
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:24,810
This quantity downstairs
I'm going to call Ifo Omega

387
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:28,590
I Omega is the complex number.

388
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:33,470
It's got a real part and an imaginary
part. The real part is on mega,

389
00:25:33,471 --> 00:25:38,130
not square minus Omega squared.
Imaginary part is Omega Gamma.

390
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:44,910
It's not a fixed complex number like every
frequency of the driving force Omega,

391
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:46,380
it's the different complex number,

392
00:25:46,381 --> 00:25:48,900
but if you're sitting at one
frequency of the driving force,

393
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:52,020
it is a particular number.
Everyone should know how to work it out.

394
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:56,820
We'll mega an artist root of k over them
or make has given to you that some real

395
00:25:56,821 --> 00:25:59,460
number gamma's given to you.
That's an imaginary part.

396
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:04,350
If you actually put the numbers, it might
look like six plus five I in the end,

397
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:07,800
the the thing I call impedance
that I is just a complex number,

398
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:11,520
but it varies from frequency to frequency.
You can see that,

399
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:18,390
okay, now we got Zift. If the
problem given to us wasZ ,

400
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:22,110
we are done. You don't have to do
any motor work. Here's the answer,

401
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:27,150
but we were told to take the real part
of this answer because x was a real part

402
00:26:27,151 --> 00:26:30,960
of the answer. Why he was not part of
the game. How do you take the deal part?

403
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:33,300
Your temptation may be well,

404
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:36,540
eat the Iomega t is costing me
got deeper as ice sine omega.

405
00:26:36,541 --> 00:26:40,590
Teresa dropped the ice sine Omega
t but that would not be right.

406
00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:43,740
Why is that not right?

407
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:50,830
Anyone know why that's not the
way to get the real part yet? Yep.

408
00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:52,323
Yes.

409
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:54,333
Okay.

410
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:59,120
Yes. This number downstairs, it's not
a real number. It's a complex number,

411
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:03,170
so if you have a complex number on the
top divided by complex number in the

412
00:27:03,171 --> 00:27:06,740
bottom, the deal part is not simply the
real part of the top. You've got right,

413
00:27:06,741 --> 00:27:07,574
the whole thing,

414
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:11,030
so you can clearly separate the real
and imaginary parts and that's what I'm

415
00:27:11,031 --> 00:27:11,870
going to do next.

416
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:17,500
Every complex number we know can be
written as an absolute value times either

417
00:27:18,171 --> 00:27:22,670
the iPhone, right? Every
z looks like mark Z,

418
00:27:22,671 --> 00:27:25,550
either the item data because
then it's Margie cost data,

419
00:27:25,551 --> 00:27:29,000
which is x plus eight times more
designed data. Which is Iwai.

420
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,400
Every complex number
can be written that way.

421
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:35,720
And what would be the magnitude of this
guy? Well, by the Pythagoras Theorem,

422
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:37,940
it'd be the square of the rail part

423
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:41,960
less the square of the
imaginary part under roof.

424
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:47,360
Every complex number that you have,
we'll have an absolute value,

425
00:27:47,361 --> 00:27:52,361
which is that squared with that square
on the route and it'll have a phase fi or

426
00:27:52,371 --> 00:27:57,371
being the condition tan fi is the
imaginary part divided by the rail park.

427
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:01,183
Yeah.

428
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:05,580
I want you to realize that in a given
problem with a given mass given friction

429
00:28:05,581 --> 00:28:07,830
given frequency board,
these are no,

430
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:13,560
there's simply a magnitude of I and the
phase Phi can be found by this process.

431
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,780
Now write it like that.

432
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:21,500
Then you get FCO over m
divided by absolute value of
I eat of the Ifi and I got

433
00:28:24,211 --> 00:28:28,950
either to the Omega t on the top.
I'm almost there.

434
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:35,310
I'm almost there because either the IFI
in the bottom, can I put it in his ear?

435
00:28:35,311 --> 00:28:37,560
The minus IFI on the top.

436
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:44,490
So did this whole thing becomes FCO over
m divided by the absolute value of I

437
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:49,690
eat the I Omega t minus five.

438
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:57,590
No, it's easier to take the deal part
because this is constant mega t minus five

439
00:28:57,591 --> 00:28:59,240
plus I sine Omega t minus five.

440
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:03,230
These are all real numbers so they're
just multiplied the whole thing.

441
00:29:03,231 --> 00:29:06,380
But the real to imagine that the
separation now comes from just taking the

442
00:29:06,381 --> 00:29:10,730
course and part of this exponential
and that is our final answer.

443
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:12,440
That's the answer we've been looking for,

444
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:17,860
which is x of t is equal to f zero over
m divided absolute value of I of course

445
00:29:20,811 --> 00:29:23,030
in Omega t minus Fi.

446
00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:34,780
Why did we go through the whole
business a complex numbers.

447
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:39,100
We went there because the
answer is not a cost center.

448
00:29:39,101 --> 00:29:43,630
It's not assigned and may get
the minus fi if you know your,

449
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:45,840
your trigonometry is costing me.

450
00:29:45,841 --> 00:29:48,990
Got The by minus sine Omega t signed fine.

451
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:52,590
So you've gotten some costs.

452
00:29:52,591 --> 00:29:56,460
Omega t has got some sine Omega t and
that's why it's hard to guess that answer.

453
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:59,850
But if you go to the complex numbers,
it comes off very easily.

454
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:01,700
Yeah.

455
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:04,970
So the next thing is to analyze the
properties of the answer you got.

456
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:11,590
You can write this whole thing in front
as some overall amplitude x not cause

457
00:30:13,221 --> 00:30:18,020
sine Omega t minus Phi, and you ask
what does this function look like?

458
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:21,410
But this function is obvious to
all of you. There's oscillating.

459
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:25,340
Notice that even those
oscillating like of course sign,

460
00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:29,510
it's not in step with the applied force.
The applied forces cost to make a tea.

461
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:33,200
It's maximum on my Curtis
said zero to Pi four Pi,

462
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:37,370
etc. This guy's maximum occurs
somewhere later. The first maximum,

463
00:30:37,371 --> 00:30:39,050
my career's been omega.
These equal to defined,

464
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,030
so it's said to be lagging the function.

465
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:45,080
You can imagine two functions oscillating,
one is behind the other one.

466
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:46,850
It reaches the maximum slightly later.

467
00:30:47,570 --> 00:30:50,000
So the first property is
in a driven oscillator.

468
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:53,540
The X will not be in step with the F.
Would you be lagging?

469
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:56,150
Audit could be leading.
Depends on what fires.

470
00:30:57,890 --> 00:30:59,780
Then what about the
amplitude of installation?

471
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:03,560
That's the thing that's very interesting.
How big is the oscillation?

472
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:08,660
It looks like f knife over the m
divided by the absolute value of I.

473
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:11,150
Let me write the absolute
value of I for you.

474
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,513
Okay,

475
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:20,970
so the amplitude of oscillation
depends on the frequency.

476
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:26,940
You got to draw the graph as a
function of frequency. What does the

477
00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:30,540
one over this look like?
Pardon me?

478
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:37,990
Yes, but a minus B squared
and B minus a square.

479
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:43,390
That's why I have not been
paying attention. Okay.

480
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,430
Yeah,
so I'm pretty careless on what I put in,

481
00:31:45,431 --> 00:31:48,760
but this is one occasion where I sort
of know it's okay because I'm going to

482
00:31:48,761 --> 00:31:52,420
square this. I don't have to remember
who is Omega naught, who's Omega.

483
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:57,760
I have be very careful that I
don't square things like here,

484
00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:02,680
but if I'm squaring it doesn't matter.
Okay,

485
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:07,710
so go back here and plot something divided
by this denominator and ask what does

486
00:32:10,721 --> 00:32:12,250
it at various frequencies.

487
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:13,820
Yeah.

488
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:18,110
When Omega is zero, that
goes away. That goes away.

489
00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:22,310
You'll get Omega and odd square and
we'll make an r squared is care with them

490
00:32:22,370 --> 00:32:26,090
and I claim what you will find initially.
Yes,

491
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:29,720
this'll become f naught over k.

492
00:32:30,410 --> 00:32:34,640
That'll be the value of this whole
amplitudes at zero frequency.

493
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:40,820
I hope that makes a lot of sense to is
zero frequency means the force is not

494
00:32:40,821 --> 00:32:44,390
even isolating. It's a constant
force. What acts are you going to get?

495
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:47,090
You're going to get the force
divided by the force constant.

496
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:49,040
That's the extra which
you will pull this spring.

497
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:53,660
That's why if you put all the Omegas
and masters back into proper place,

498
00:32:53,661 --> 00:32:55,190
you will find it.
F Not over k.

499
00:32:56,360 --> 00:33:00,770
Then what happens is as Omega
increases this denominator,

500
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:06,090
one of these guys and denominator,
they're starting to vanish if gamma,

501
00:33:06,091 --> 00:33:09,000
but a very, very tiny number,
but Omega naught equals Omega,

502
00:33:09,001 --> 00:33:12,330
you will be dividing by various small
lumber and the answer will have a huge

503
00:33:12,331 --> 00:33:16,740
rise. Then you can see an Omega
goes to infinity, very large Omega.

504
00:33:16,770 --> 00:33:20,070
You're dividing by Omega Square.
It'll fall off like this.

505
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:29,160
Now, one of the homework problems is to
find out exactly where it peaks with.

506
00:33:29,161 --> 00:33:30,270
Gamma is very small.

507
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:33,680
You don't have to do much work to know
it peaks at Omega Equals Omega and arc,

508
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:38,010
but otherwise he was near that. That's
a phenomenon that's called resonance.

509
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:43,560
Resonance is the following. You are
playing a force f not constant. May Get t

510
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:48,330
you go on bedding the frequency
and responds to your force.

511
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:52,410
The system oscillates the absolute
of Oscillation is the largest.

512
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:56,370
When the applied frequency is very near,
the natural frequency

513
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:02,250
predict the limit of very small gamma.
This maximum is very close to a mega knot.

514
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,420
That's called resonance.
If gamma is really tiny,

515
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,930
you can get greives where
it's incredibly peaked.

516
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:16,380
So that's when system started vibrating
a lot. That's why I'm in here. Car.

517
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:19,150
It goes over certain bumps.
If they're pediatric,

518
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:22,660
they are hitting your cotter and
certain frequency and that frequency is

519
00:34:22,661 --> 00:34:26,680
anywhere near the natural frequency of
vibration of your suspension system.

520
00:34:26,681 --> 00:34:28,870
And the car caught begins to resonate.

521
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:33,580
That is his famous bridge in Tacoma
that was getting hit by these wins.

522
00:34:33,850 --> 00:34:37,270
They were coming at some
frequency and by bad luck,

523
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:41,080
they coincided with the natural frequency
of the bridge so that as his famous

524
00:34:41,081 --> 00:34:43,360
movies made for high
school and with the bridge,

525
00:34:43,361 --> 00:34:47,260
jostle is more than more than more than
uh, twists and turns and collapses.

526
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:50,470
That's another example of
resonance. People always say, yeah,

527
00:34:50,471 --> 00:34:53,890
I can resonate with what the person
is saying. What does that mean?

528
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:56,200
The person is saying
whatever the hell he wants.

529
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:58,840
Some people think is interesting
and some people think it's boring.

530
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:01,930
It's the same thing here.
The forces acting at a certain frequency.

531
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:06,550
If your natural frequency is close to
that, your response is high. If it's low,

532
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:11,560
you don't care. Same thing. That's
mechanical systems selecting a frequency.

533
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:15,850
In fact, this is how radios
work. If you have a radio,

534
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:18,010
if there's only one radio station,

535
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:21,700
you build an electrical circuits in
which occurred like select to go back and

536
00:35:21,701 --> 00:35:23,590
forth or oscillate at a certain frequency.

537
00:35:23,890 --> 00:35:26,290
Radio stations should send
signals of that frequency.

538
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:27,580
Your responses will be very high,

539
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:31,840
but what if there is more than one
radio station which is the fact of life?

540
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:32,863
What did they do?

541
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,730
What they do is each one sense a
signal at a different frequency.

542
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:41,310
You'll take your radio and the in signed,

543
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:46,270
well I forgot you could do you know what
a dialogue is because you are now there

544
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:49,950
is pushing the some other button. There
is a time when you had to turn the dial.

545
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:52,400
When you turn a dial,
you're changing the properties,

546
00:35:52,401 --> 00:35:54,900
the electrical circuit and
changing its natural frequency.

547
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:58,860
You move the natural frequency to the
lines up with the frequency of the radio

548
00:35:58,861 --> 00:36:00,990
station with one particular station.

549
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:05,160
Then the response from that station is
very high and that's the sound you hear.

550
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:09,460
Other stations are also present but
you are not near their maximum. Uh,

551
00:36:09,461 --> 00:36:12,300
they were there. We are sitting
somewhere here and somewhere here.

552
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:17,640
So you want the station frequency
to come under this residence.

553
00:36:17,641 --> 00:36:20,370
Peak is if you've got a bad radio,

554
00:36:20,371 --> 00:36:23,970
it'll pick up sound from any stations
because it's not very refined.

555
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:27,120
If the peak is broad,
you will get sound from many stations.

556
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:31,840
You want to build a system which is very
finally sensitive to the frequency and

557
00:36:31,970 --> 00:36:35,100
that requires gamma to be very
small cameras, very, very small.

558
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:37,500
You can see if gamma is going to zero,

559
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:41,820
the nominated is one divided by zero.
It's going to be infinite.

560
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:45,450
So if gamma is very tiny, one
over, very tiniest, very big,

561
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:49,080
and you can get enormous spikes in
response. And that's what people need.

562
00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:55,350
Okay. The last thing you need to
do this problem set, by the way,

563
00:36:55,351 --> 00:36:59,400
I know this problem sounds very
nasty towards the end. It got tough.

564
00:36:59,401 --> 00:37:03,630
You got email. Uh, I
agree with you that this,

565
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:09,210
this whole course is somewhat more
difficult than it has always been.

566
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:10,440
Okay.

567
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:15,090
I'm aware of that fact and I will bear
this fact in mind when you go into your

568
00:37:15,091 --> 00:37:17,880
final because for some reason,
uh,

569
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:21,420
I want her to use problems not in
our book for technical reasons.

570
00:37:21,421 --> 00:37:23,910
So I got them from here
and there or made them up.

571
00:37:24,330 --> 00:37:27,210
They generally tend to be more
challenging and more time consuming.

572
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:30,150
So if you thought this is a tough course,
well,

573
00:37:30,151 --> 00:37:31,170
it's supposed to be a tough course,

574
00:37:31,171 --> 00:37:33,540
but maybe not this hard or
not this time consuming.

575
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:36,510
So I will remember that in the end of the,

576
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:40,560
when I make the final exam or look at
your grade, I will have to compare to you,

577
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:44,340
not simply to your predecessors,
but I love to give you some,

578
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:49,920
cut you some slack and then compare
to you to previous generations. So,

579
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:50,863
uh,

580
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:55,590
this use of complex numbers is something
from which I will not. However,

581
00:37:55,591 --> 00:37:57,990
back down,
it turns out that yes,

582
00:37:57,991 --> 00:38:00,540
you can do all of this without
using complex numbers. Why?

583
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:03,330
Because in the real world,
everything has got real numbers.

584
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:09,290
So you can in fact by Rgf triganom metric
identities solve it with science and

585
00:38:09,291 --> 00:38:11,610
course science.
But eventually I'll give you a problem.

586
00:38:11,611 --> 00:38:14,100
But he just cannot do
it in a meaningful way.

587
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:19,200
The power of complex numbers is they
turn differential equations is into

588
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:20,820
Algebraic equations.

589
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,280
All you have to do is find the
roots of a quadratic equation.

590
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:26,790
Whereas what he started out was to find
the solution of a differential equation.

591
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:30,870
That advantage you will lose if
you stop using complex numbers.

592
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:33,930
And when you do quantum
mechanics and second term,

593
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:37,180
a complex numbers are in
the equations of motion.

594
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,870
The analog of f equals I made,
there's an ice sitting there.

595
00:38:41,410 --> 00:38:45,100
So you cannot escape the eye.
It's there.

596
00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:48,930
So I'm saying, uh, depending on
how much exposure you've had,

597
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:50,230
you have to do more or less work.

598
00:38:50,231 --> 00:38:51,970
But you just got to get
used to complex numbers.

599
00:38:51,971 --> 00:38:54,670
You've got to get used to the
absolute value, the phase angle,

600
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:57,880
how the metal plate them if you
already to know it that good.

601
00:38:57,910 --> 00:39:00,640
If you don't know it, you have to
do more work than other people,

602
00:39:00,770 --> 00:39:05,200
but I'm not going to
let off on it. Yes, no.

603
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:06,670
Anything you need to know.

604
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,720
Differential equations is what I've done
for you in the class today. That's it.

605
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:13,270
That's the only part you know
and with complex numbers,

606
00:39:13,271 --> 00:39:17,800
you turned it into ordinary equations
so you have to go over these steps and

607
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:21,370
work them out.
That's the part I cannot do for you.

608
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:24,040
That's something you have to do.
All right.

609
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:29,040
What is finally missing is that x of t
if I wrote for you or they wrote about

610
00:39:31,090 --> 00:39:33,520
which is [inaudible], I don't want
to write the [inaudible] again.

611
00:39:33,521 --> 00:39:36,550
Is f not or what am I?
Maybe I will write the whole thing.

612
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:39,700
If not over m divided by absolute value.

613
00:39:39,790 --> 00:39:44,790
I times cosine Omega t minus five it
turns out this is not the full answer to

614
00:39:46,121 --> 00:39:50,260
the question. What happens when I
push a mass? Let's understand why.

615
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:53,140
Suppose I go to this
mass in spring system,

616
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:57,430
I grabbed it or t equals
zero and start shaking. Well,

617
00:39:57,431 --> 00:40:01,630
rt equals zero x was zero because
I grabbed her. The t equals zero.

618
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:04,330
Well at t equals zero if
they go to this solution,

619
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:09,850
it's not giving me zero each saying
it's ethanol over MRI costs signed Phi.

620
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:14,740
So what happened to the freedom I had
to assign the velocity and position

621
00:40:14,741 --> 00:40:18,730
arbitrarily. Well, it turns
out that I can still do that.

622
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:24,900
That's because this solution has got a
part that's actually missing and the part

623
00:40:25,201 --> 00:40:28,690
that's missing is this
complementary solution, eh,

624
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:32,770
to the minus gamma t over to
cause saying of Omega prime,

625
00:40:32,771 --> 00:40:34,480
t minus finite.

626
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:40,960
You can always add the
solution to this solution.

627
00:40:42,370 --> 00:40:47,140
Why is that? Because of x obeyed a
certain equation. If I put that in,

628
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:51,130
I'm saying adding this part will not
change the fact that obeys the equation.

629
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:56,470
Let's ask ourselves why go
back to the top line there.

630
00:40:58,390 --> 00:41:00,780
F X,
double dark was gamma is dark,

631
00:41:00,781 --> 00:41:05,110
was Omega naught squared x will be
equal to if not over him, make a tea.

632
00:41:05,111 --> 00:41:09,010
If you put this in now, what if you
keep adding? This is the solution.

633
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:12,070
Will you mess it up?
Imagine adding this to the left hand side,

634
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:16,150
but I claim on the lefthand side there'll
be no extra terms because this guy

635
00:41:16,151 --> 00:41:21,120
double dark plus gamma at times. This
guy.plus, oh Megan r-squared them.

636
00:41:21,130 --> 00:41:22,120
This guy is zero.

637
00:41:22,990 --> 00:41:27,100
This is the function which you would
say is annihilated by the operations.

638
00:41:27,101 --> 00:41:30,100
On the lefthand side,
it's like saying the following.

639
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:32,380
If you want to function who's derivative

640
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:38,510
is equal to the sine x, then I
miss you. I know the function.

641
00:41:38,511 --> 00:41:42,320
There's minus cost sine x and you all
know you can add to that at constant.

642
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:47,240
Where do you add the constant way doesn't
do screw up everything because the

643
00:41:47,241 --> 00:41:48,800
database to have a constant is zero.

644
00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:55,870
But here this is not a constant and yet
the combination of data reduce appearing

645
00:41:56,151 --> 00:41:58,250
the equation act on
this to give you a zero.

646
00:41:59,990 --> 00:42:03,620
That's why you can add it without
screwing up what you've done so far.

647
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:07,280
So the way you do these problems is you
first find this function that depends on

648
00:42:07,281 --> 00:42:09,830
the applied force and
you add to this solution.

649
00:42:09,831 --> 00:42:13,330
You get foot free even in the
absence of an applied force. Yes.

650
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:19,890
Let's call the complimentary function and
this is called the particular solution.

651
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:23,990
This particular solution depends on
the force and this is the function.

652
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:26,780
I don't know why it's called compliment.
Maybe it compliments the answer.

653
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,160
It's it's a Freebie.

654
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:31,040
You don't pay for it with any force
but it's called complimentary,

655
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:33,860
but you got to add the
two to get the final lands

656
00:42:36,350 --> 00:42:37,161
so you will still have,

657
00:42:37,161 --> 00:42:41,150
this number's a and fine art hanging
around and how do you select them?

658
00:42:41,510 --> 00:42:45,950
You select them if on top of it somebody
tells you that this driven oscillator

659
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:49,190
had a certain coordinate and
certain velocity at t equals zero,

660
00:42:50,210 --> 00:42:54,410
so you'll evaluate the whole expression
at t equals zero by putting t equals

661
00:42:54,411 --> 00:42:56,650
zero everywhere.
You'll get one equation in wellbeing,

662
00:42:56,690 --> 00:42:59,880
a and fine art and they'll take
the deliberative for the Valencia.

663
00:42:59,890 --> 00:43:01,520
They said that equal to given number.

664
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,880
You got the second equation
involving a and find out,

665
00:43:03,881 --> 00:43:08,660
you will juggle the two equations and
solve for the two numbers and find out,

666
00:43:10,310 --> 00:43:14,720
okay, so that is the whole
story. Okay. That's uh,

667
00:43:16,250 --> 00:43:17,810
that's what I tried to do yesterday,

668
00:43:17,811 --> 00:43:21,650
but this is not the first time it's
happened to me that I tried to go fast in

669
00:43:21,651 --> 00:43:25,400
the end. I lost time because I was not
happy with the way it was explained.

670
00:43:26,030 --> 00:43:30,320
And uh, I usually come back and say
sorry and then do it all over again.

671
00:43:30,890 --> 00:43:35,480
Okay. But that is only so much I can
do. Uh, the rest is up to you guys.

672
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:39,260
You have to have to do the work
and you have to do more problems.

673
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:41,480
Okay.

674
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:46,480
So now we're moving off to
another topic or the other topic.

675
00:43:47,450 --> 00:43:51,700
Uh, somebody was saying that
relief is not very different. Uh,

676
00:43:53,210 --> 00:43:57,560
okay. This is, these are waves,
but I think it's going to be, look,

677
00:43:57,650 --> 00:44:02,600
I think this probably is the hardest
point of what we're doing in this term,

678
00:44:03,050 --> 00:44:07,070
at least mathematically. Everything
else we do, heat, hot water, cold water,

679
00:44:07,071 --> 00:44:08,630
that kind of stuff you've
done in high school.

680
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:13,460
That's all in near future is going
to be a lot easier. Okay. Waves.

681
00:44:14,210 --> 00:44:16,880
So everyone has a good feeling for waves.
You go to a lake,

682
00:44:16,881 --> 00:44:19,070
you know if you're a
hit man for the mafia,

683
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:22,340
you're dropping things in with
some weight. They go down.

684
00:44:22,370 --> 00:44:27,170
What's the first thing they do?
Once a body's falling into the water,

685
00:44:28,010 --> 00:44:30,830
it's carving out some body
of water and diving in.

686
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:33,540
So the water next to it
dives into fill that hole,

687
00:44:34,330 --> 00:44:37,380
but then the water even next to it
drives in to fill the hole left behind by

688
00:44:37,381 --> 00:44:38,214
these guys.

689
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:42,660
For you it looks like when the ripples
traveling outwards from the center,

690
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:47,610
so this is the classic example of a way.
If you've got one example,

691
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:49,550
you can latch onto it.
Every time I say wave,

692
00:44:50,430 --> 00:44:53,310
so what's the wave in this problem?
Yes,

693
00:44:53,311 --> 00:44:58,311
that if I drop plot of the height of the
water versus the place where I dropped

694
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:03,360
the rock, or maybe I should do it.
Pop view here, this is the top view.

695
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:08,660
After awhile you got these
ripples emanating from this
point or if you kept your

696
00:45:08,911 --> 00:45:13,080
eye next to the water, you will find
these ups and downs going outwards.

697
00:45:14,970 --> 00:45:18,630
So the wave is some displacement of
a medium. That's what people say.

698
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:23,370
That's not a perfect definition because
we know electromagnetic waves have no

699
00:45:23,371 --> 00:45:27,600
medium. They travel in vacuum. But I
think for this purpose in this course,

700
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:31,890
you should imagine a way it was what
happens when you excited medium.

701
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:35,050
So here's what,

702
00:45:35,050 --> 00:45:38,380
here's the way to think about the way you
all understand the harmonic oscillator

703
00:45:38,381 --> 00:45:42,700
pretty well. White Mass in brings system
in equilibrium will sit there forever.

704
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:46,930
If you give it a kick,
it'll start vibrating.

705
00:45:47,020 --> 00:45:51,160
I don't this equilibrium position that
you have to keep track only one variable

706
00:45:51,250 --> 00:45:54,070
x,
which is location of the mass.

707
00:45:54,970 --> 00:45:58,000
The wave is an oscillation off a medium.

708
00:45:58,001 --> 00:46:01,080
That means at every point in space that
is something that's ready to oscillate.

709
00:46:02,430 --> 00:46:05,900
So it's not a system with one degree
of freedom system, infinite numbers,

710
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:09,070
big does of freedom because the height
of the water at each point is an

711
00:46:09,071 --> 00:46:10,030
independent variable.

712
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:13,960
It can jump up and down with time
and that's what is oscillating.

713
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:19,510
So if you don't do anything but the water,
it'll stay at that height.

714
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:21,760
But if you fiddled with it,
you dropped something,

715
00:46:21,761 --> 00:46:23,800
you hit it with something
and start vibrating.

716
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:30,020
But except this is the vibration not of
one variable but if available in space

717
00:46:30,401 --> 00:46:34,990
and time x was a function of time
and the name we use for the wave,

718
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:39,850
if something is oscillating such as the
water measurement from some point x,

719
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:43,380
I'm going to use the symbol sigh of x,
the Dennard,

720
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:48,370
the height of the water from its normal
position at the point x at time t

721
00:46:50,010 --> 00:46:54,250
so x is not a dynamical variable here.
X labels the point size,

722
00:46:54,251 --> 00:46:56,700
the dynamical available size.
The thing jumping up in though,

723
00:46:59,490 --> 00:47:02,070
okay no,
that are two kinds of waves.

724
00:47:02,790 --> 00:47:04,950
That's the longitudinal
wave and the transfers wave

725
00:47:06,690 --> 00:47:10,980
and we define them as follows.
The way of travels out with some velocity,

726
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,240
so I'm going to use the symbol
v for the velocity of the wave.

727
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:19,740
That's something for which all of you
have good intuitive understanding,

728
00:47:19,741 --> 00:47:23,250
so no need to mess it up right now.
You go to the lake, you drop a rock,

729
00:47:23,490 --> 00:47:26,820
you see when the waves get to the shore,
you take the distance divided by time.

730
00:47:27,030 --> 00:47:29,530
That's the velocity in sound.

731
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:32,920
You know you light up a firecracker
after a while you hear it.

732
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:36,340
You can see how long it took and how far
you are and you can find the velocity.

733
00:47:36,730 --> 00:47:41,440
That's the velocity of sound in air.
No, these velocities are all variable.

734
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:44,500
I liked the velocity of light.
That doesn't seem to depend on anything.

735
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:49,250
All of that. The cities, depending on
various conditions, double last year,

736
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:51,310
sound depends on the
temperature for example,

737
00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:55,510
or do you can take the following thing.
You can take an iron rod,

738
00:47:56,260 --> 00:47:59,800
which you know is made up a lot of atoms
and you'll take a hammer and you hit it.

739
00:47:59,801 --> 00:48:02,360
Here you stand.
You basically,

740
00:48:02,361 --> 00:48:05,890
you compress these atoms and they compress
the atoms next to them and the shock

741
00:48:05,891 --> 00:48:10,840
waves travels through this ride that's
also called sound that travels at the

742
00:48:10,841 --> 00:48:13,840
speed, which is much faster
than the speed of sound in air,

743
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:17,170
but it is technically also called sound.

744
00:48:17,350 --> 00:48:19,570
If you were to create your
living inside the iron bar,

745
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:23,970
you will think of it as sound. Here's
another way you can hear it. Um,

746
00:48:23,980 --> 00:48:26,350
for example is the standard example.

747
00:48:26,351 --> 00:48:31,150
Here's the railway track and that is
some kind of a mountain here and you,

748
00:48:31,151 --> 00:48:33,940
you're over here and the
train is coming here.

749
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:40,800
It turns out if the train
lets out a sound, you will,

750
00:48:40,801 --> 00:48:42,840
the sound will travel around
the band and you will hear it.

751
00:48:44,070 --> 00:48:46,650
But actually the pounding
of the train on the tracks,

752
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:50,640
we'll set up shock waves in the track
that you can hear by putting your ear to

753
00:48:50,641 --> 00:48:55,590
the track and you will hear the train
before you hit it by depending on the

754
00:48:55,591 --> 00:48:56,670
sound coming through the air.

755
00:48:56,671 --> 00:48:59,580
Because the waves going through
the solid travel much faster.

756
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:04,470
Okay. So I would recommend that
if you're going to do this,

757
00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:08,220
you do the somewhere here because you
want to have enough time to move if you do

758
00:49:08,221 --> 00:49:12,450
it here. Okay? So most of the
things, please don't do this at home.

759
00:49:13,350 --> 00:49:16,920
This would be done by a trained person,
but I certainly did it as a kid.

760
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:20,670
Listen for trains before they come around
the bend. And you can actually hit it.

761
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:25,310
The track audit in water,
that explorations in water,
you can hear them fast,

762
00:49:25,311 --> 00:49:27,810
that if you're under the water,
then if you're outside the water,

763
00:49:28,050 --> 00:49:30,510
because the waves travel faster in water,

764
00:49:30,511 --> 00:49:35,370
then in a thunder and lightning is the
most famous example of something happens

765
00:49:35,371 --> 00:49:38,670
in the sky. This light gets to you
first and the sound gets to you.

766
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:42,420
You're traveling at different velocities.
Okay,

767
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:46,980
so now let's talk about longitudinal
transfers. Waves. When I talked to you,

768
00:49:48,060 --> 00:49:52,110
I think you sort of know what happens.
The ad in this room is have some pressure

769
00:49:53,730 --> 00:49:56,650
and that pressure is constant
and the pressure is pushing you.

770
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:59,400
The Ed room from the outside
is going through your uh,

771
00:49:59,730 --> 00:50:03,300
istation count pushing the drum from the
insight and the two pressures balance

772
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:07,720
and you don't feel
anything. If I talk, uh,

773
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:12,740
the vocal cards move back and forth and
the increase in decrease the pressure as

774
00:50:13,891 --> 00:50:16,950
I talk. If I push out, increased
the pressure. If I go backwards,

775
00:50:16,951 --> 00:50:19,600
I decompress the editor.
Reduce the pressure though.

776
00:50:19,601 --> 00:50:23,460
Shock waves propagate dod year,
they hit your ear drum.

777
00:50:24,210 --> 00:50:27,000
But the ear drum is getting the
pressure different from the outside,

778
00:50:27,230 --> 00:50:31,540
but the inside pressure is fixed.
So what happens is when I decompressed,

779
00:50:31,550 --> 00:50:33,170
the ear drum comes out and it goes in,

780
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:35,990
it goes back and forth
and the ear drum moves.

781
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:41,570
Then behind the Ed round might be a little
bones and then the bones go and that

782
00:50:41,571 --> 00:50:45,320
is some tube and there's not the
doctors take over from this point.

783
00:50:45,830 --> 00:50:49,100
So some loose Harris
shaking in this fluid,

784
00:50:49,740 --> 00:50:52,700
then it picks up some nervous
things and goes to your brain.

785
00:50:53,450 --> 00:50:56,120
Then you figured out, you know, you at
least know what the person's saying.

786
00:50:56,210 --> 00:50:58,760
You know how she's, your wife is
talking to this particular fashion.

787
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:01,100
But you can at least
understand and translate.

788
00:51:01,740 --> 00:51:06,050
So that's a long chain of transducers of
energy from sound to the stuff in your

789
00:51:06,051 --> 00:51:09,740
year into your brain.
I draw the line of the hydro.

790
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:14,210
I don't want to go on the other side of
the head. Drunk cause a very shaky turf,

791
00:51:14,450 --> 00:51:16,460
but the part,
this part I know very well,

792
00:51:17,060 --> 00:51:21,860
it's a sound wave and it's a longitudinal
wave for the following reason.

793
00:51:21,980 --> 00:51:25,070
If you look at the pressure waves,
the molecules of air,

794
00:51:25,130 --> 00:51:29,210
they're going back and forth following
my hands and the signal from me to you.

795
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:33,170
It's also going from me to you. So the
motion is in line with the velocity.

796
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:38,000
The motion of the medium isn't the same
direction as the motion of the wave.

797
00:51:39,260 --> 00:51:43,550
A transverse wave is what you find
in water. If you are on a string,

798
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:47,630
take a string clamped or that. Then they
do give it a little flick like that.

799
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:52,610
This bump after a while it will end up
here is the rope is moving transfers,

800
00:51:53,090 --> 00:51:55,160
but the velocity of the
signal is to the right.

801
00:51:57,230 --> 00:52:01,280
So do not confuse the motion of the
medium with the motion of the signal.

802
00:52:02,690 --> 00:52:06,200
Okay. The rope at any given point is
either at rest or going up and down,

803
00:52:07,070 --> 00:52:08,930
but the signal is going
from left to right.

804
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:14,050
So the medium doesn't have to actually
move in the direction of the wave.

805
00:52:14,770 --> 00:52:15,281
For example,

806
00:52:15,281 --> 00:52:19,750
if a bunch of people line up and each
one tells the person next to the next

807
00:52:19,751 --> 00:52:23,140
person some secret and the secret is
eventually transmitted all the way at the

808
00:52:23,141 --> 00:52:25,570
end.
What does travel is a secret.

809
00:52:25,690 --> 00:52:29,530
The actual person in the first place
has not gone over physically to the end.

810
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:34,270
So what happens is you are sitting there
not doing anything and suddenly you

811
00:52:34,271 --> 00:52:36,070
hear something,
you pass it on to the next person,

812
00:52:36,071 --> 00:52:39,130
then you've gone back to doing nothing.
Then the signal travels.

813
00:52:39,250 --> 00:52:40,690
That's what'll happen in the rope here.

814
00:52:40,990 --> 00:52:44,170
This section of the rope is not doing
anything. When this pulse hits that,

815
00:52:44,171 --> 00:52:45,460
it'll jump up and down for a while.

816
00:52:45,461 --> 00:52:50,110
Then it'll quiet down and somebody to
the right. We'll start moving. Okay,

817
00:52:50,111 --> 00:52:52,840
so they had the examples of
longitudinal and transfers waves.

818
00:52:55,710 --> 00:52:59,880
So we have have the notion of velocity.
No.

819
00:53:00,690 --> 00:53:05,400
I want to consider one concrete example
of a wave so you people have a good

820
00:53:05,401 --> 00:53:07,950
feeling of how to study waves in physics.

821
00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:11,893
Yeah,

822
00:53:13,420 --> 00:53:17,680
so that are many, many waves, water waves,
electromagnetic waves, elastic waves.

823
00:53:17,681 --> 00:53:20,860
I'm going to do one,
I think to do one thing in some depth.

824
00:53:21,250 --> 00:53:24,970
We'll give you a feeling for hobby analyze
waves. That's going to be waves on a,

825
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:30,960
so you have to imagine that I have a
string as being clamped the two n's and

826
00:53:30,961 --> 00:53:34,470
somebody plucks the string say
into that shape and Lex go,

827
00:53:34,740 --> 00:53:37,050
we know the string is going
to vibrate back and forth.

828
00:53:38,820 --> 00:53:40,470
Let's measure the cord in it.
X,

829
00:53:41,250 --> 00:53:46,250
which is the point on the string and
PSI is the displacement of the string.

830
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:51,870
At that point you guys got
that. This is really the x axis.

831
00:53:51,871 --> 00:53:54,310
This is not my string.
That is my string.

832
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:59,670
Each point is labeled by an x value that
it would have the string relax to the

833
00:53:59,671 --> 00:54:00,504
normal position.

834
00:54:01,070 --> 00:54:05,490
We are asking what is the displacement
of the string at the point x at time t

835
00:54:06,710 --> 00:54:08,650
society is so new,
dynamical Beatty,

836
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:12,180
namely the variable for which we like
to write the equations governing his

837
00:54:12,181 --> 00:54:15,300
motion. And we want to ask
how does cyber 80 but time,

838
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:20,190
what will it do if I started out,
what will it do?

839
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:23,730
You understand the parallel
to the mass in spring system,

840
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:27,510
the mass in spring system,
you've got a mass and you've got a spring,

841
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:29,790
you pull the mass out
to some new location,

842
00:54:29,970 --> 00:54:32,250
you let it go and you
want to know what it does.

843
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:36,900
The answer was Casa mega t no.
At every point x,

844
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:42,200
I have some string and I displaced all
those degrees of freedom and I let them

845
00:54:43,261 --> 00:54:46,350
go and they're going to do something and
I want to know how they are all very,

846
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:49,740
so previously we had only one coordinator,

847
00:54:49,770 --> 00:54:53,940
which they call x with varied with time.
Now at every point x,

848
00:54:54,210 --> 00:54:58,260
I have a coordinate side that varies
with time and while job is to find the

849
00:54:58,261 --> 00:55:00,420
equation satisfied by sy.

850
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:05,730
Okay,

851
00:55:05,730 --> 00:55:09,510
so let us take a string and the
string has to be under some tension.

852
00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:13,110
That means you hang some weights on the
end or you tighten it with some screws.

853
00:55:13,410 --> 00:55:16,980
That's attention, tension so that the
string is willing to dying to break apart.

854
00:55:17,010 --> 00:55:21,820
If you cut it to a t. T is the tension on
the string without detention? Uh, none,

855
00:55:21,870 --> 00:55:24,240
none of this will work.
So he had a string.

856
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:25,913
Okay.

857
00:55:27,260 --> 00:55:31,640
And I'm going to analyze
the fate of assignee.

858
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:34,580
Tiny segment of length.
DX.

859
00:55:38,340 --> 00:55:42,450
An essential it did here is called
[inaudible], which is the mass,

860
00:55:42,451 --> 00:55:47,280
but unit length. That means you put
the string on a weighing machine,

861
00:55:47,850 --> 00:55:51,090
you find a mass and you divided
by the length. For example,

862
00:55:51,091 --> 00:55:55,170
if you've got a 10 meters ring and
it weighs a one 10th of a kilogram,

863
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:59,610
then the masculine it link is one
over thousand kilograms per meter.

864
00:56:02,310 --> 00:56:04,350
And t is the tension.

865
00:56:07,610 --> 00:56:11,180
The textbook may use F for tension
because t is the time period also.

866
00:56:11,181 --> 00:56:14,210
So it depends on what
symbol they use in the book.

867
00:56:14,211 --> 00:56:19,190
I'm not completely sure I'm going to
call it t because it's been called tea in

868
00:56:19,191 --> 00:56:20,024
the past.

869
00:56:20,540 --> 00:56:25,540
Now I pulled this and I want to
know what the whole string we'll do.

870
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:30,310
Who is going to tell me now, man, I mean,

871
00:56:30,311 --> 00:56:33,520
what authority will decide
the behavior of the strings?

872
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:35,710
What do we have to appeal to?

873
00:56:38,550 --> 00:56:42,510
Yes.
Pardon me.

874
00:56:47,340 --> 00:56:48,600
Very good.
So he said,

875
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:51,540
find the force that will return
it to the original position.

876
00:56:51,541 --> 00:56:53,310
And what was the issue that you mentioned?

877
00:56:55,160 --> 00:56:55,993
Pardon me.

878
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:04,120
Right. But, uh, we are going to apply.
Yes. Any other answers before they go?

879
00:57:04,150 --> 00:57:04,983
Yes.

880
00:57:05,450 --> 00:57:10,450
Modeled the emotion of the story by
saying that by pretending that just using

881
00:57:12,761 --> 00:57:16,930
some point in and being like, this is, the
motion is just the same as if we had a,

882
00:57:16,931 --> 00:57:18,890
uh, a us, us, us,

883
00:57:19,750 --> 00:57:22,660
mass on sprint and it's
oscillating back and forth.

884
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:26,540
Yeah. It will look like that.
That is correct. But you all,

885
00:57:26,541 --> 00:57:27,890
I want you to understand this,

886
00:57:28,730 --> 00:57:33,200
that are no new laws that I'm going
to invoke. I'm not going to say, well,

887
00:57:33,201 --> 00:57:34,640
we just started master's in spring.

888
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:38,240
Today's time to study strings and I'm
going to tell you a new law of motion.

889
00:57:38,750 --> 00:57:41,750
There's only one law of
motion that is f equals m. A.

890
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:45,620
The whole purpose of my exercise now
is to show you that really does control

891
00:57:45,621 --> 00:57:47,390
that way.
It's Super Law.

892
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:52,310
Everything mechanical follows from that
law and I want to show you ethicals mas

893
00:57:52,340 --> 00:57:54,620
all I have and I got to use it properly.

894
00:57:54,860 --> 00:57:56,540
That's going to tell me
what the string will do.

895
00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:01,700
So what I do is the string is of course
a long and extended and complicated

896
00:58:01,701 --> 00:58:02,460
object.

897
00:58:02,460 --> 00:58:07,460
I isolate a portion of it of lengthy x
and I'm going to apply ethical CMA to

898
00:58:08,121 --> 00:58:08,954
that guy.

899
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:14,300
All I need to know is the f the total
force on it and I'm going to eat better to

900
00:58:14,301 --> 00:58:17,540
mass times acceleration.
Okay.

901
00:58:17,541 --> 00:58:22,541
Now this force on this little segment
is the tension pulling this way,

902
00:58:23,330 --> 00:58:25,820
the same tension pulling that way,
the tension on the string,

903
00:58:25,821 --> 00:58:27,380
it doesn't change from point to point,

904
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:33,380
but the angle at which it is pulling
is not necessarily the same. Here,

905
00:58:33,410 --> 00:58:38,410
there is some angle theta plus Delta
data and here there is an angle data.

906
00:58:43,340 --> 00:58:46,010
This force is at an angle to
say Tara below the horizontal,

907
00:58:46,011 --> 00:58:48,290
this pulling about a plus delta data,

908
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:52,070
so the string is curving.

909
00:58:52,410 --> 00:58:56,600
Therefore the the tangent to the string
at this end and that end are not quite

910
00:58:56,601 --> 00:58:59,660
the same and that's the key because
if they were exactly the same,

911
00:59:00,350 --> 00:59:01,970
the same tension on the two ends.

912
00:59:02,180 --> 00:59:05,180
If you take any object like this
and apply exactly the same force,

913
00:59:05,780 --> 00:59:10,780
they will cancel because the opposite
forces andF is zero and may will be zero

914
00:59:10,821 --> 00:59:11,780
and this thing won't move.

915
00:59:12,830 --> 00:59:16,280
The reason that moves is because even
though the magnitude of the force is the

916
00:59:16,281 --> 00:59:18,380
same, the angle at which
is acting is not the same.

917
00:59:19,790 --> 00:59:23,930
So I'm going to find out the component
of the force here and take the difference

918
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:24,793
from there.

919
00:59:25,780 --> 00:59:30,780
It's the force here we'd be tee
times sine theta plus Delta Theta.

920
00:59:34,820 --> 00:59:37,040
Theta is the angle with the horizontal

921
00:59:38,870 --> 00:59:42,350
and the force of the other side
will be tee times. Sine Theta.

922
00:59:43,490 --> 00:59:47,720
Theta is the angle made by the string
from the horizontal and that angle is some

923
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:49,160
changing over this tiny lane.

924
00:59:51,030 --> 00:59:51,440
Yeah.

925
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:56,300
Next approximation. That's
the force that's going to
be mass times acceleration.

926
00:59:57,090 --> 00:59:58,550
Mass up this little segment.

927
00:59:58,580 --> 01:00:03,400
Is the mass per unit length times
the length of the segment? No.

928
01:00:03,790 --> 01:00:07,580
What is the acceleration in
the language of Calculus?

929
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:12,080
What does the acceleration here?
Pardon me.

930
01:00:13,730 --> 01:00:18,470
Ah, he said deep two x over Dt Square,
but the d by Dt squared is right.

931
01:00:18,471 --> 01:00:23,471
It's not d two of x off side
because you've got to understand,

932
01:00:24,260 --> 01:00:26,240
I think, look, this was not fair trick,

933
01:00:26,241 --> 01:00:30,910
but you have to be aware that what is
oscillating up and down is the coordinate.

934
01:00:30,911 --> 01:00:35,120
I X is not a real dynamical court
in excess. A label on the string.

935
01:00:36,140 --> 01:00:40,940
What? Jumping up and down the PSI, so
the acceleration, the second bit of it,

936
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:44,620
and I write partial derivative
because psych can vary with X.

937
01:00:44,620 --> 01:00:47,570
Audit can vary with time and I want
to take the second time did have it.

938
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:50,680
Yeah.

939
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:55,180
Now come to the lefthand side and you
assume the angles involved. Very small.

940
01:00:56,250 --> 01:01:00,380
The angles involved are very small. I
remind you guys at the following identity,

941
01:01:00,390 --> 01:01:04,210
sine theta begins
sustained up plus.dot dot.

942
01:01:04,211 --> 01:01:05,800
You remember the CTSA award for you?

943
01:01:06,350 --> 01:01:11,350
Of course signed data is one minus data
squared over two and we have decided

944
01:01:11,891 --> 01:01:15,220
that we are going to treat data
is so small that data square,

945
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:20,640
we're not interested and 10 data which
is [inaudible] is now state over one.

946
01:01:23,620 --> 01:01:24,453
We just stayed up.

947
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:29,600
So small angle approximation is scientists
though approximately equal potato

948
01:01:30,210 --> 01:01:34,180
corn sainted approximately equal to one
10 data maybe approximately the place

949
01:01:34,181 --> 01:01:38,820
might data.
So first nice break.

950
01:01:38,821 --> 01:01:43,821
We don't have to work with sign with
just one t of data plus Delta Theta minus

951
01:01:44,340 --> 01:01:46,110
that which is dealt at data.

952
01:01:48,570 --> 01:01:49,403
Yeah,

953
01:01:49,460 --> 01:01:54,460
Delta Theta is a change in the angle from
the left end of the string bit to the

954
01:01:55,071 --> 01:01:58,460
right end of the string
bean. No, I got a d x here,

955
01:01:58,550 --> 01:02:02,990
so what I'm going to do is divide
by a dx and multiplied by the x.

956
01:02:07,610 --> 01:02:11,510
We are almost there in
did I in the equation?

957
01:02:12,550 --> 01:02:17,430
I look, I've been calling a dx and Delta
x so pardon that? Just call it, uh,

958
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:21,480
just dx.
You the x,

959
01:02:22,140 --> 01:02:24,720
the two PSI over Dt Square.

960
01:02:26,730 --> 01:02:27,810
Now what does the data,

961
01:02:29,250 --> 01:02:34,250
I'm going to say data is the same as Stan
data in the small angle approximation.

962
01:02:37,050 --> 01:02:40,530
Tamp data is these side the x,

963
01:02:42,420 --> 01:02:45,390
you know from the calculus,
if you're more horizontally by DX,

964
01:02:45,391 --> 01:02:49,500
a new move vertically by the PSI.
These ideas is the Tan of the angle.

965
01:02:49,590 --> 01:02:51,720
That's one of the first things
you learned in calculus.

966
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:57,560
So this is really de by Dx of
these IDX that becomes deep.

967
01:02:58,080 --> 01:03:01,880
Two PSI over dx squared equals the mew,

968
01:03:02,560 --> 01:03:05,010
the two psi over Dt Square.

969
01:03:06,900 --> 01:03:09,570
Now some of you may find
the derivation heart,

970
01:03:10,470 --> 01:03:14,610
then forget about the details.
You're not responsible for that.

971
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:17,460
But some of you may say,
look,

972
01:03:17,820 --> 01:03:22,050
I don't ever want you to tell me something
which you cannot prove unless it's an

973
01:03:22,051 --> 01:03:25,200
axiom or the law of nature.
But this is not a new law of nature.

974
01:03:25,201 --> 01:03:26,700
So I have to tell you where I got this.

975
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:31,140
I got this by applying f equals
m a tiny portion of the string.

976
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:35,460
And you can ask yourself, when you pull
a string up, why does it come down?

977
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:41,460
It comes down because there's a tension
on the string and the tension here and

978
01:03:41,461 --> 01:03:44,790
the tension here have vertical
components that don't quite match.

979
01:03:45,390 --> 01:03:47,520
You see the string is
flattening out like this.

980
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:51,930
The vertical downward component of
this is bigger than the vertical upward

981
01:03:51,931 --> 01:03:55,380
component of this force. If it resolve
it, the vertical, horizontal part,

982
01:03:55,710 --> 01:04:00,270
the downward part is bigger than the
upward part in this picture that there's a

983
01:04:00,271 --> 01:04:01,800
net force bringing you down.

984
01:04:02,580 --> 01:04:06,780
But I'm not bringing you down is because
the deliberative here and here are not

985
01:04:06,781 --> 01:04:08,490
the same because the
derivative is the slope.

986
01:04:08,940 --> 01:04:11,850
So the whole thing depends on the rate
of change of the rate of change and

987
01:04:11,851 --> 01:04:16,080
that's why you get this. But the mass
of the tiny segment also depends on dx.

988
01:04:16,170 --> 01:04:19,950
So dx cancels in the end,
you drop it and you get this equation.

989
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:23,250
So what I want you to
think of is dictated.

990
01:04:23,310 --> 01:04:28,310
DX is really d by the x of these IDX.

991
01:04:30,630 --> 01:04:34,330
And but I should actually use partial
data with this because I depends on x,

992
01:04:34,350 --> 01:04:39,090
empty. So if you a little careful with
that, you get d two Psi over DP Square.

993
01:04:41,010 --> 01:04:46,010
So now I'm going to write
down the final wave equation.

994
01:04:47,970 --> 01:04:51,750
From this point on, you have to get
engaged in the problem because you,

995
01:04:51,751 --> 01:04:54,150
even though you may or may
not follow the derivation,

996
01:04:54,630 --> 01:04:57,000
you should know what is
called the wave equation.

997
01:04:57,690 --> 01:05:01,020
This is the way we
equation d two PSI over.

998
01:05:01,021 --> 01:05:03,690
DX squared is equal to

999
01:05:05,460 --> 01:05:10,140
one over v Square,
d two Psi or d p square,

1000
01:05:10,770 --> 01:05:14,640
but v square is equal to

1001
01:05:17,050 --> 01:05:22,050
t over a meal or to be the
square root of p over me.

1002
01:05:23,350 --> 01:05:24,760
I just invented a symbol [inaudible].

1003
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:31,060
This is very important.
What do you have to know is that Cy,

1004
01:05:31,720 --> 01:05:35,680
the displacement of the string at the
point caught labeled x horizontally from

1005
01:05:35,681 --> 01:05:40,510
the left hand at the time t varies
with time according to this equation.

1006
01:05:43,740 --> 01:05:48,600
This is a very famous equation and it
turns out you take any elastic medium and

1007
01:05:48,601 --> 01:05:50,430
you are disturbed a little
bit from equilibrium,

1008
01:05:50,910 --> 01:05:53,190
always seems to be patients of this type.

1009
01:05:54,810 --> 01:05:59,130
So our job from now till sometime is
to analyze the equation and see what it

1010
01:05:59,131 --> 01:06:03,090
means, what are the consequences
of this wave equation.

1011
01:06:04,740 --> 01:06:07,740
And even though I call it d,
it has UNICEF velocity,

1012
01:06:08,050 --> 01:06:11,220
I have no right to argue that it
really is the velocity of the wave.

1013
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:15,360
We'll have to find out
it got dimensions of velocity.

1014
01:06:15,361 --> 01:06:19,530
You can check by putting the units yet.
Okay,

1015
01:06:19,531 --> 01:06:23,760
but now let me write down a
solution to this equation.

1016
01:06:23,790 --> 01:06:27,540
Then we will understand
what can happen.

1017
01:06:28,230 --> 01:06:32,430
So this is like saying I got some
equation, second database to Webex.

1018
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:34,593
Yeah

1019
01:06:36,620 --> 01:06:38,720
is equal to some number claims,

1020
01:06:38,770 --> 01:06:43,620
sex and we set the answer this constantly
got tea and sine Omega t but nobody

1021
01:06:43,640 --> 01:06:45,350
got secondary to the perspective space.

1022
01:06:45,351 --> 01:06:48,710
Second did it with respect to time
and I know that this guy is going to

1023
01:06:48,711 --> 01:06:52,910
oscillate up and down,
but he's going to oscillate.

1024
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:57,140
If you imagine a string,
if you take a string out of waterway,

1025
01:06:57,141 --> 01:07:00,440
which is traveling back and forth,
the triplets at traveling,

1026
01:07:01,550 --> 01:07:03,860
if you took a snapshot of
the way at a given time,

1027
01:07:04,760 --> 01:07:06,560
it'll be going up and down in space.

1028
01:07:07,610 --> 01:07:10,760
Artifice stored at one point in the
water and have the wave go past you.

1029
01:07:11,300 --> 01:07:15,200
The water will go up and down
in time at a given space.

1030
01:07:16,390 --> 01:07:19,820
I understand it. The waves coming towards
the shore. Do you stand in one place?

1031
01:07:20,150 --> 01:07:23,570
You don't. You don't have to move the
way we'll go past you and Brad you are.

1032
01:07:23,570 --> 01:07:26,250
The water will go up
and down with time art.

1033
01:07:26,300 --> 01:07:28,160
If you took a picture
of it at one instant,

1034
01:07:28,520 --> 01:07:31,070
the way it will go up and
down in space at a given time.

1035
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:35,390
So waves oscillate in space and time
and you have to guess the answer.

1036
01:07:36,170 --> 01:07:39,920
Now if I had more time I can tell you
guys how did they use the answer is not

1037
01:07:39,921 --> 01:07:43,430
very hard but I just don't have that
kind of time so I'm going to just write

1038
01:07:43,431 --> 01:07:48,020
down his solution and in fact there are
many, many solution to the equation.

1039
01:07:48,080 --> 01:07:50,570
It's very general.
So I'm going read a particular solution.

1040
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:52,370
The solution I'm going to write down,

1041
01:07:53,240 --> 01:07:57,320
it looks like this is some
number which to the amplitude

1042
01:07:59,660 --> 01:08:01,070
and it looks like cause sign

1043
01:08:02,630 --> 01:08:05,930
some number called k
times x minus Omega T.

1044
01:08:06,860 --> 01:08:09,230
Unfortunately this case
not a force constant.

1045
01:08:09,260 --> 01:08:14,260
It is some new symbol and Omega is another
symbol who's meeting we will deduce

1046
01:08:14,430 --> 01:08:15,263
shortly.

1047
01:08:17,220 --> 01:08:17,920
Yeah,

1048
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:22,660
at least you can see that I just
cannot right away of like x minus t or

1049
01:08:22,661 --> 01:08:25,780
something cause of course should have
an argument with this nor dimensions,

1050
01:08:26,170 --> 01:08:29,140
so if I have an ex I should multiply
multiplied by some number that's got units

1051
01:08:29,141 --> 01:08:33,400
of inverse x and if I have a time I should
multiply by something that looks like

1052
01:08:33,401 --> 01:08:35,380
a frequency from dimensional analysis.

1053
01:08:35,770 --> 01:08:40,540
I look for a solution of this foreign
to these equations. Once again,

1054
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:43,540
whether you saw this is by the way is
called a partial differential equation

1055
01:08:43,570 --> 01:08:47,020
because it involves partial [inaudible].
All I'm going to be doing,

1056
01:08:47,260 --> 01:08:50,540
I'm going to be content with this showing
you that this solution when I stick it

1057
01:08:50,541 --> 01:08:55,390
into this equation actually works.
Let us first verify that it works.

1058
01:08:56,020 --> 01:09:01,020
Then it will come next Monday and analyze
in detail what does this really do?

1059
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:04,300
We'll come to that in a moment.
Let's verify that it works.

1060
01:09:05,470 --> 01:09:09,610
So let's take this IDX.
What happens when you take these IDX?

1061
01:09:10,690 --> 01:09:14,650
When you take a partial, a little bit
of an x, it says, forget about time,

1062
01:09:14,980 --> 01:09:16,480
treat x as the only variable.

1063
01:09:16,630 --> 01:09:20,580
Then you will get minus a sign k,

1064
01:09:20,900 --> 01:09:25,090
x minus Omega t times or did I bet
too of what's inside the argument,

1065
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:29,500
which happens to be key
knife.

1066
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:32,750
You differentiate the second
time the two side, the x square,

1067
01:09:33,090 --> 01:09:37,430
you do the whole thing again and
then you'll get minus a k square

1068
01:09:39,280 --> 01:09:42,080
sign.
K X minus Omega t

1069
01:09:45,130 --> 01:09:48,640
I'm sorry. Yes, thank you. No,

1070
01:09:48,641 --> 01:09:51,280
you should take d two psy d t square.

1071
01:09:52,540 --> 01:09:57,050
You would get minus Omega
squared, a uh, course sign,

1072
01:09:57,560 --> 01:09:59,130
k x minus Omega t.

1073
01:10:02,210 --> 01:10:05,490
You could take one over v squared
times that you would get this.

1074
01:10:07,450 --> 01:10:07,820
Okay.

1075
01:10:07,820 --> 01:10:09,320
What does the wave equation say?

1076
01:10:09,650 --> 01:10:13,970
It says the secondary way to have an
x should be one of [inaudible] to the

1077
01:10:13,971 --> 01:10:17,970
second derivative in time and
for my solution, that's a second.

1078
01:10:17,971 --> 01:10:22,550
Did a bit of an ex that a second time.
I want them to match.

1079
01:10:23,150 --> 01:10:26,480
Well, they're almost there. A
matches. The cost matches the cost,

1080
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:31,960
but Omega and care not independent numbers
or may go over to v should be equal

1081
01:10:32,121 --> 01:10:32,954
to k.

1082
01:10:37,640 --> 01:10:42,290
In other words,
this wave equation for waves on a string,

1083
01:10:43,430 --> 01:10:48,430
we'll have solutions that look like this
where it can be any number you like k

1084
01:10:49,190 --> 01:10:52,040
and Omega between the two of them.
That is one degree of freedom.

1085
01:10:52,070 --> 01:10:57,070
You can pick k at will and pick Omega so
that Omega equals kv pick Omega freely

1086
01:10:58,730 --> 01:11:02,630
and choose case or that case we'll make
a over B but that is a relation between

1087
01:11:02,631 --> 01:11:06,200
the two of them,
which you can write in any number of ways.

1088
01:11:11,020 --> 01:11:14,130
So let us put that knowledge
back into the solution.

1089
01:11:14,610 --> 01:11:19,260
Let us say omega is in fact kv so that
the write that explicitly in terms of the

1090
01:11:19,261 --> 01:11:19,511
CAE,

1091
01:11:19,511 --> 01:11:24,511
which is completely free to sign now
looks like a cause k times x minus I hear

1092
01:11:27,981 --> 01:11:32,340
is about you guys gotta do a little mental
Algebra here. If I pull the key out,

1093
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:37,830
can you see the tea? Will be multiplied
by Omega over k but Omega over case v.

1094
01:11:38,430 --> 01:11:39,263
Okay,

1095
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:44,780
so this is my solution.
It costs k x minus V t

1096
01:11:47,590 --> 01:11:50,170
and that is a very
pretty result and I just,

1097
01:11:50,260 --> 01:11:52,820
I will conclude by telling
you what that is telling.

1098
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:59,640
It stays the CFX t which depends on x
and depends on ti depends on x and t

1099
01:12:02,021 --> 01:12:05,320
through this combination.
X minus bt. Other words,

1100
01:12:05,580 --> 01:12:08,920
if I explained this a bt has a certain
value science, a certain value.

1101
01:12:09,970 --> 01:12:14,530
If I change x and if I change
t keeping x minus vd constant,

1102
01:12:14,770 --> 01:12:18,910
the function doesn't change,
right? Because it's functionally
of this combination.

1103
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:25,560
I will argue that that really means it's
the way of this traveling at a velocity

1104
01:12:25,631 --> 01:12:29,510
v.
Let me show you why.

1105
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:33,270
Let's take a function e
to the minus x squared.

1106
01:12:33,560 --> 01:12:36,830
You must've seen this function in
statistics. It looks like this.

1107
01:12:37,610 --> 01:12:42,610
It likes to have x equals zero
take the function that exited,

1108
01:12:42,611 --> 01:12:44,390
he placed by x minus v.
T

1109
01:12:46,700 --> 01:12:47,780
where does this function?

1110
01:12:48,440 --> 01:12:53,420
Habits maximum you'd has the maximum when
this guy on top vanishes that just say

1111
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:58,730
when x equal to Vt.
So if you took the function,

1112
01:12:58,731 --> 01:13:00,320
either the x minus V t square,

1113
01:13:00,380 --> 01:13:04,640
the minus sign [inaudible] be here
at at that time it'll be here,

1114
01:13:04,641 --> 01:13:07,730
but at every instant the bump,
we'll be moving to the right.

1115
01:13:07,940 --> 01:13:12,380
You can see with the Velocity v
because the peak is at a location VT,

1116
01:13:13,970 --> 01:13:16,760
so in a way of the whole profile,
what was it,

1117
01:13:16,761 --> 01:13:20,720
the velocity and therefore this symbol
we use here is in fact the velocity of

1118
01:13:20,721 --> 01:13:25,380
the wave.
Well,

1119
01:13:25,390 --> 01:13:28,120
maybe I'll give you one extreme example.
Arctic will the zero.

1120
01:13:28,930 --> 01:13:32,770
It just looks like co was k x and we
all know what costs and Kx looks like.

1121
01:13:33,190 --> 01:13:35,050
It's got a maximum at x equal to zero.

1122
01:13:37,270 --> 01:13:39,610
If you wait a little
longer had is that bad?

1123
01:13:39,611 --> 01:13:43,360
Is this maximum little later
increased x a little bit.

1124
01:13:44,130 --> 01:13:45,760
If you increased time a little bit,

1125
01:13:46,540 --> 01:13:49,720
you've got increased x a little bit so
that these two still cancel each other.

1126
01:13:50,690 --> 01:13:53,140
Originally,
experts at zero and t was a zero.

1127
01:13:53,141 --> 01:13:57,220
You're at a maximum little
later after some time built a t.

1128
01:13:57,520 --> 01:14:00,460
If you go to the point delta x
so that these two numbers cancel,

1129
01:14:00,700 --> 01:14:02,050
you're still writing the maximum,

1130
01:14:03,070 --> 01:14:06,460
but that means the delta
x over Delta t is v.

1131
01:14:06,820 --> 01:14:10,900
That means if you moved to the right
after same delta t you would ride the,

1132
01:14:11,620 --> 01:14:16,620
that means the crest is moving at the
Velocity v so I think to summarize what

1133
01:14:17,231 --> 01:14:20,280
I've shown you so far is that
when you take a string and you,

1134
01:14:20,281 --> 01:14:22,300
I have attention on it,
you pull it and let it go.

1135
01:14:22,690 --> 01:14:25,510
It vibrates according to this
equation that the first statement,

1136
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:28,180
this is a solution.

1137
01:14:28,330 --> 01:14:31,630
I'm not telling you it's the most gentle
one or the only one that anything I

1138
01:14:31,631 --> 01:14:36,130
want to start at least have one concrete
solution and I'm not told you yet how

1139
01:14:36,131 --> 01:14:39,340
to visualize the function or I have
told you whatever the function is,

1140
01:14:40,180 --> 01:14:44,950
it is drifting to the right at a speed
that we call me because any function of x

1141
01:14:44,951 --> 01:14:48,700
minus VT has a property that if
it did something at x equals zero.

1142
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,010
It does the same thing
that x equals the Vt.

1143
01:14:51,160 --> 01:14:54,280
That means the whole shape is
bodily transported to the right.

1144
01:14:55,090 --> 01:14:58,000
So this really signifies a
wave traveling to the right.

1145
01:14:58,090 --> 01:15:01,360
If you wanted a way of traveling to the
left, we should put a plus sign here.

1146
01:15:01,580 --> 01:15:02,590
Then we'll go backwards.
