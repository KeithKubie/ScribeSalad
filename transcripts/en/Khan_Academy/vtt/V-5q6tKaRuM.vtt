00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.440
We're asked to use the
distributive property

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:04.314
to expand this expression.

00:00:04.314 --> 00:00:05.980
So let me get my
little scratch pad out.

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:08.320
So this is the same
question right over here.

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.960
So we're going to multiply 6
times this entire quantity.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:17.390
So let me just rewrite
this as 6 times negative 4w

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.210
plus one half.

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:22.390
So we're going to
distribute the 6.

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.490
So this is going to be 6
times negative 4w times 6,

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.900
plus 6 times one
half, so this is

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.320
going to be-- let me
just write it this way--

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:45.060
6 times negative 4w
plus 6 times one half.

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:48.100
And this is going to be equal
to 6 times negative 4w is

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:53.570
negative 24w, and then
6 times one half is 3.

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.950
So we get negative 24w plus 3.

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:58.520
So let me write that down.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.980
Negative 24w plus 3.

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.143
And let's check our answer.
